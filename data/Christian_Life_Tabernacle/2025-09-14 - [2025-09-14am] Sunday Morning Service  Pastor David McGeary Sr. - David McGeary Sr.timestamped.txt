[25:48] Uh it's the time of the year again. I
[25:51] have a my whole family having their
[25:53] birthday in September. Um my wife's
[25:56] birthday was yesterday. Uh my daughter
[25:58] is going to have her birthday, my mom's
[26:00] birthday, my elder sister's birthday, my
[26:03] brother-in-law's birthday. So uh got a
[26:06] lot of people in September. So uh
[26:09] run me dry a little bit. Uh
[26:13] I I was now thinking about uh God's
[26:15] marvelous grace that if not for God's
[26:18] grace uh and his mercy um we wouldn't be
[26:22] where we are today. Uh I'm not even
[26:24] talking about uh anything materially.
[26:27] But uh just looking at the world and
[26:30] looking at what they have and looking at
[26:32] what I have like I'm so rich like I'm so
[26:36] so rich. And I'm not talking about
[26:37] material things. I'm talking about the
[26:39] the lack of they just don't I'll tell my
[26:42] wife sometimes I say they just can't
[26:44] retain God in their memory. There's
[26:46] nothing that comes close to God in them.
[26:49] Like for people to just sit down and not
[26:51] be able to think to say where do I come
[26:53] from, where am I going to? And so I I
[26:56] told I was telling my mom the other day,
[26:59] I said, "Oh, the only thing I just want
[27:02] is after this war is done. When I'm
[27:03] done, God knows I'm done. Just take me
[27:05] cuz I know I'm his child." And so I'm
[27:08] singing marvelous grace this morning.
[27:15] Marvelous grace of our loving
[27:19] Lord.
[27:21] Grace that exceeds
[27:24] our sin and our guilt.

[27:33] Here where the blood of the lamb was
[27:38] plead.
[27:39] Grace,

[27:43] God's grace,
[27:46] grace that will pardon and cleanse
[27:50] within.
[27:52] Grace,
[27:54] grace is God's
[27:57] grace.
[27:58] Grace that is greater than all are seen.
[28:05] Seen and despair like the sea waves cold
[28:11] threaten the soul
[28:14] within it loss.
[28:17] Grace that is greater. Yes. Grace untold
[28:23] point to the refuge the mighty
[28:28] cross.

[28:39] and cleanse within.

[28:47] grace,
[28:48] grace that is greater than hopeless.

[29:11] creams inside
[29:14] whiter than snow you may be today.

[31:16] requests we want to read at the same
[31:17] time. Um um I just uh I got a couple
[31:22] announcements from the um uh the
[31:25] deacons. Uh so please try to avoid uh
[31:29] dropping people off on this side of the
[31:31] building when you're especially kids. uh
[31:33] it just creates a traffic for those that
[31:35] are coming off of the streets and trying
[31:37] to uh come in quickly when you park over
[31:39] here to drop somebody off. It just makes
[31:42] it difficult. So, we want to avoid any
[31:44] traffic situations. So, if you could do
[31:46] that also um uh uh please be mindful of
[31:50] the uh uh sitting arrangement that was
[31:53] announced. I know today we have a lot
[31:55] that are going that have gone to the
[31:56] Oklahoma meetings and we pray nobody
[31:59] Matthews preaching over there. um we
[32:02] just want to pray and keep them in
[32:03] prayer. But yeah, just keep in mind
[32:05] especially for Sunday morning and the
[32:08] goal is to make sure that when we have
[32:10] the building full that we have people
[32:12] sit uh sitting appropriately to the
[32:14] right place so that way you don't get
[32:16] moved and everything like that. Amen. Uh
[32:18] we want to uh this morning remember
[32:20] brother John Enchanti is requesting
[32:23] prayer that we keep uh her mom in prayer
[32:26] his mom in prayer. We just want to
[32:27] continue to pray for her that the Lord
[32:29] will certainly undertake for the
[32:32] situation. Also, sister Lucero and
[32:34] family. We know that sister Lucero's dad
[32:36] passed away. We certainly want to keep
[32:38] the family in prayer that the Lord will
[32:40] touch them and and be their comfort in
[32:42] the hour of need. Amen. Brother Tommy
[32:45] writes uh requesting prayer for a
[32:47] brother-in-law uh who has uh uh uh he
[32:52] has a prostate cancer and we certainly
[32:54] want to lift him up in prayer that the
[32:56] Lord will certainly uh uh come and touch
[32:59] his body and work a miracle. We we serve
[33:02] a God, a working miracle God. He doesn't
[33:05] operate by what the doctor says or by
[33:08] what the situation looks like. He works
[33:10] from the invisible into the visible. And
[33:13] I believe we we can come with confidence
[33:15] this morning with this needs on our
[33:17] heart and know that he will answer to
[33:19] all of them. If you have a need upon
[33:20] your heart, just lift your hand up to

[33:24] offerings, if you could come at this
[33:25] time. Amen. Brother Jonathan, if you

[43:46] How great
[43:49] is our God?
[43:51] [Music]
[43:53] How great
[43:56] is our God?
[44:00] How great,
[44:04] how great
[44:07] is our God.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our gracious heavenly father,
[44:14] soon we're going home. Lord, that's been
[44:17] on the heart of every believer down
[44:19] through the ages.
[44:22] Father, we ask that our eyes will keep
[44:25] steadfast, that you'll deal with our
[44:27] hearts and our minds, heavenly father,
[44:31] that our enthusiasm and anticipation
[44:35] will continually grow stronger. We ask
[44:38] you to bless us this morning in Jesus
[44:41] precious and wonderful and holy name we
[44:45] pray. Amen. Amen. God bless. You may be
[44:49] seated for a moment this morning.
[44:52] Nice to be in the house of the Lord. Um
[44:56] just trusting that all is well. Thank
[44:59] you musicians for
[45:02] everything that you do. Um, I want to
[45:06] make a couple announcements and uh and
[45:10] you know and
[45:13] uh the hardest part that we always have
[45:16] is is uh communicating,
[45:20] you know, that everybody gets the same
[45:22] message. And and so we we we're going to
[45:25] make a a a small change in in our our
[45:30] Sunday school. And so we want everybody
[45:33] to listen closely, especially if you
[45:37] have uh Sunday school children or young
[45:41] children coming up. Um
[45:45] we we set certain things in order when
[45:51] uh we started because we weren't sure
[45:54] how many people that we would have and
[45:57] we were dealing with uh size and space,
[46:01] classroom size and classroom space. So
[46:05] we we put things in order so we knew
[46:08] what we had to work with. So, we we saw
[46:11] our material, we saw what we had to work
[46:14] with, and we all agreed that if we
[46:17] needed to make some tweaks and changes
[46:20] that we would do that along the way. And
[46:24] so, um,
[46:27] one of the things that we're going to
[46:29] change is we're going to allow
[46:34] the four year olds to enter Sunday
[46:37] school when they turn four.
[46:41] So, if you have a child and they turn
[46:44] four, when they turn four, they can go
[46:47] ahead and enter into Sunday school. Um,
[46:52] so we're going to allow
[46:55] any child that turns four to enter into
[46:58] Sunday school at that time. whenever
[47:02] whatever class that you enter into in
[47:06] the beginning of the year, you stay with
[47:08] that class for that Sunday school
[47:12] session. So, for example, if if you're
[47:15] in grade six and seven, if we have a six
[47:19] and seven class and you turn eight,
[47:23] well, you're in that class, you don't
[47:27] leave that class and go up to the H. you
[47:30] stay with that class for that whole time
[47:34] period. And you have to understand,
[47:37] we're trying to organize and have kids
[47:39] and and everybody's trans moving and
[47:44] growing old. If you would all stay the
[47:46] same age, that would make it
[47:50] perfect,
[47:51] you know, but for some reason you go off
[47:54] and you get married and you have kids
[47:56] and the kids grow and and things are
[47:59] changing. So, we are going to do that.
[48:01] Uh, if we have to, we're going to do
[48:04] some things. If we have to build and
[48:07] expand some classrooms, we'll do that.
[48:10] But, so if your child turns four, if you
[48:13] would like to put it in Sunday school,
[48:15] now we're trusting you that your child's
[48:19] mature enough to come in to Sunday
[48:23] school and sit. You know, we're there to
[48:27] teach them. We're not there to raise
[48:29] them. You You understand? In other
[48:32] words, uh
[48:35] you know, you know, if your child obeys
[48:37] and they're good and and so you know, we
[48:40] we trust you as parents. But if you feel
[48:43] your child's ready for Sunday school and
[48:45] they turn four. So if you have a child
[48:48] that's going to have a birthday in two
[48:50] months from now and they turned four,
[48:52] you're welcome to bring them to Sunday
[48:54] school if you believe they can behave
[48:57] and and can be orderly. Okay? So we've
[49:03] we've done that uh to you. you know, I
[49:06] don't want to be like the unjust judge
[49:08] who had the mother coming and yelling at
[49:11] him all the time and then not doing
[49:13] something, you know. So, uh, we've all
[49:16] agreed to do that. Uh, me and brother
[49:18] Tim sat down. We we had a conversation
[49:21] and dealt with it and we both felt that
[49:23] we would like to to do that. So, does
[49:27] everybody understand that when your
[49:29] child turns four, you can bring them to
[49:31] Sunday school? Okay. And uh but whatever
[49:36] class you're in, you stay with that for
[49:38] the year. That's the only change we're
[49:40] making is we're allowing the four year
[49:42] olds to come. So uh that's good. And
[49:46] then the other announcement we'd like to
[49:48] make is October 19th,
[49:52] by the grace of the Lord, we're trusting
[49:54] in good weather. We're going to have a
[49:56] fall event for all the families with
[50:00] children. So, we have young people, you
[50:03] know, that are we usually say they're
[50:06] from 13 on up, teenagers and stuff like
[50:09] that. We try to do things for them. This
[50:12] is going to be a fall event for for all
[50:16] family members. So, if you have children
[50:18] that aren't
[50:20] four yet, but they're young children,
[50:23] we're just going to have a nice uh uh
[50:26] festival. Uh I guess that's a word that
[50:29] we can use. uh fall event uh October
[50:33] 19th, that's a Saturday, and we'll have
[50:37] uh of activities and uh fun things to do
[50:42] uh for you uh there. So, if you have
[50:46] your children, you like to come out,
[50:48] it's all families with uh young children
[50:52] that like to come out and uh and spend
[50:55] that Saturday with us. and uh we'll
[50:59] decide if we want to cook out or
[51:02] whatever we'll do. But we want you to
[51:04] set that day aside and uh we're going to
[51:07] have a nice time and provide activities
[51:10] and and just fun for all the young kids
[51:13] that they can all come together. Is that
[51:15] all good? Amen. You love the Lord this
[51:18] morning. Amen. Uh we welcome all our
[51:22] visitors and and uh uh those that are
[51:26] with us uh this morning. We trust that
[51:29] the Lord will be uh mighty on your
[51:33] behalf. Uh we're going to uh listen this
[51:37] morning and
[51:40] uh to 32 minutes of the beginning of a
[51:47] sermon called taking sides with Jesus.
[51:50] And this was preached by brother
[51:52] Brandham in uh 1962
[51:57] which I think the sixth month would be
[51:58] June June 1st 1962.
[52:03] And it's got some amazing things in it.
[52:08] And uh one of the great questions is
[52:11] answered in this little statement about
[52:15] what happens to you when you go to sleep
[52:19] and why that God
[52:24] uh had every generation looking for the
[52:28] coming of the Lord. So if you listen to
[52:31] this, you'll get a great answer to that
[52:34] question. The other thing that is
[52:37] pointed out in this is the necessity to
[52:42] carry on
[52:44] and to remain in the traditions wherein
[52:48] that we're taught. The one thing that
[52:51] God's word doesn't do is God's word does
[52:54] not evolve.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Okay? It's revealed
[52:59] but it doesn't evolve. So God's never
[53:03] changed. The word's never changed. Now
[53:06] there be may be portions of the word of
[53:09] God that God didn't make known yet,
[53:13] okay? Or reveal yet, but whatever plan
[53:17] that God had, he had in the beginning.
[53:20] He's the alpha and the me mega. He's the
[53:23] beginning or the end. There's no
[53:25] surprises for God. He knows what's going
[53:29] to happen. He's omnipotent.
[53:32] He's omnipresent.
[53:34] He He knows what the future is by
[53:38] fornowledge.
[53:39] He doesn't have to go out and say, "I'm
[53:41] going to fix this or I'm going to change
[53:44] this or I'm going to do that." He didn't
[53:47] say, "You're going to heaven and you're
[53:49] going to hell."
[53:52] He didn't forordain or predestinate that
[53:56] way. He predestinated by He knew.
[54:01] He knew what you would do. He knew that
[54:04] your heart would be tender. He knew that
[54:07] you would receive the word. He knew that
[54:09] he planted a seed there. And therefore,
[54:12] he made the provision. So always with
[54:15] God, if you're if you're going to face
[54:18] something down the road, he knows you're
[54:21] going to face it. Now, he may not tell
[54:24] you. He may not warn you. He may just
[54:28] see how that you take it, but he will
[54:30] make a provision for you because the
[54:33] word of God says that God makes a way of
[54:35] escape. So there's a way of escape there
[54:39] for you. And if you would put if we
[54:42] would I I don't ever want to sound like
[54:44] I'm separate. If we would always put God
[54:49] first, then we would know that he
[54:51] provided something for us. You know, we
[54:54] have a lot of ideas. We have a lot of
[54:56] things that we think of. We have a lot
[54:59] of things that we feel uh uh, you know,
[55:04] is going to be a certain way or think
[55:07] they're going to be a certain way. You
[55:09] know, I'm sure that when Leslie married
[55:11] me, she thought she was marrying Prince
[55:13] Charming. You know what I mean? I was
[55:16] just riding in on a white horse to save
[55:20] her heart. You know what I mean? And and
[55:22] and she found out that maybe I wasn't
[55:25] all that I was supposed to be, but love
[55:29] kept us together. And you know, so you
[55:32] have a lot of ideas sometimes, but if
[55:34] we'll if we'll wait on the Lord, he'll
[55:37] work everything out for us. He'll He'll
[55:40] take care of us. He He'll take care of
[55:42] you. He'll be there for you. He loves
[55:46] you. He died for you. He has a place
[55:49] prepared for you. And that's what he
[55:51] told us. He says, "I go and I prepare a
[55:54] place for you. If it wasn't so, I would
[55:57] not have told you. But if I go, I will
[56:01] come again and receive you that where I
[56:05] am, you may be also. That's why we've
[56:09] gathered here this morning. We're not We
[56:13] have not gathered to prove a doctrine.
[56:16] We're not gathered to have a social
[56:18] event. We are gathered here this morning
[56:22] because we believe with all of our
[56:25] hearts that the Lord Jesus is soon
[56:28] coming. And I know you'll say, "Well,
[56:31] that's what everybody's thought for
[56:33] every age. There's a reason for it. Why
[56:37] God did it." It'll be explained to us
[56:40] today. So, let's stand up this morning
[56:43] and we'll read one little scripture.
[56:47] And and I I just think that this
[56:50] scripture it explains it all.
[56:54] And and um it's found in Genesis
[57:00] chapter 1 verse one
[57:07] and we'll read here in Genesis.
[57:11] In the beginning, God
[57:17] In the beginning, God
[57:20] created the heavens and the earth.
[57:25] And the earth was without form and void,
[57:30] and darkness was upon the face of the
[57:33] deep, and the spirit of God moved upon
[57:38] the face of the waters.
[57:40] In the beginning was God
[57:43] and the spirit of God moved.
[57:46] Amen. God bless you this morning.
[57:49] Heavenly Father, we ask you to bless
[57:52] your word this morning. May we be
[57:54] attentive for these next 32 minutes.
[57:58] Father, may we learn and understand as
[58:02] we go forward. In Jesus precious name we
[58:05] pray. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[58:08] seated. As we've been preaching about
[58:11] the path forward
[58:13] and uh and as we found out that that in
[58:19] order sometimes to go forward that
[58:22] you've got to go back. So if you get off
[58:25] the original path
[58:28] then you may be going but you're not
[58:32] going forward.
[58:34] You're going somewhere.
[58:36] But in order to go forward to your
[58:40] destination, you've got to be on the
[58:43] forward path. Uh you know, cuz I many
[58:47] times I I will take a side street
[58:50] because I I don't I don't want to sit
[58:53] there and go through the traffic, but
[58:57] not always the time. It's the fastest
[59:00] way. You know, I took the airport
[59:02] turnoff the other day because the
[59:04] traffic was all backed up. And I looked
[59:07] out there and there was the wreck. I was
[59:09] only about 200 yards from getting past
[59:13] it, but I got impatient.
[59:16] You know what I mean? I wanted to be
[59:18] moving. I wanted to be be going forward,
[59:22] but sometimes what's forward to us isn't
[59:25] always forward with God. And there's
[59:28] only one way to go forward with God and
[59:32] that's in God's word.
[59:34] So if you're not going God's way,
[59:38] you understand then you're not going
[59:40] forward. So what we'll hear a lot this
[59:44] morning is why that
[59:48] God started a church. what the burden
[59:51] was, what the path forward was, how God
[59:55] wanted the church, and how important it
[59:58] is for the church to stay with what was
[1:00:03] taught and how our nature is always to
[1:00:07] go find something new that we think will
[1:00:11] fix the problem.
[1:00:14] God knows the problem.
[1:00:17] He provided the answer. May we have
[1:00:20] faith that God's way is always the best
[1:00:24] way and that he knows us. He knows what
[1:00:28] we have need of and he'll provide. I
[1:00:31] hope this is a blessing to you. We'll
[1:00:33] make a few comments afterwards. Uh God
[1:00:37] bless you this morning as we listen to
[1:00:39] the next few moments.
[1:00:43] some place in Louisville where you you
[1:00:45] eat and it's called um uh let's see dog
[1:00:50] patch restaurant. I got one today. When
[1:00:53] anyone eats there, then they take the
[1:00:56] money that you gave them and send the
[1:00:58] church the tithing off of it. Somewhere
[1:01:00] at 319 West Jefferson Street. I guess
[1:01:04] that's why Billy had it laying here so
[1:01:07] they could see.
[1:01:09] Um, that's mighty nice.
[1:01:13] Now, brethren,
[1:01:15] I don't know what your procedure of of
[1:01:18] man's meeting, just what you do or how
[1:01:23] you conduct your meetings. And if I get
[1:01:26] off a schedule here, why off the regular
[1:01:28] routine, why you call my attention to
[1:01:31] it? It was purpose tonight. I thought as
[1:01:36] I had uh a dinner not long ago with our
[1:01:41] most beloved pastor, Brother Neville,
[1:01:44] and I was saying something to him, what
[1:01:46] was on my heart. And I thought if we get
[1:01:49] a bunch of man together and the
[1:01:51] ministers, our uh colleagues here of the
[1:01:56] gospel and man, we could talk to one
[1:02:00] another in a way that we wouldn't talk
[1:02:02] it before the public because we're all
[1:02:05] in we're man and understand as man,
[1:02:09] Christian man. And that way uh usually
[1:02:13] in a congregation, a group, you say
[1:02:16] something and and one will lean it a
[1:02:18] little this way and one lean it that way
[1:02:20] and and then it goes all out. But where
[1:02:21] we come to try tonight to tell you what
[1:02:27] I have in my heart
[1:02:29] uh concerning the church and its uh and
[1:02:33] its uh place and its position. And then
[1:02:37] if we get done in time, I would like to
[1:02:39] speak to you just a little bit on the
[1:02:41] word if it's all right. Just kind of
[1:02:43] settle that. So we'll get our business
[1:02:46] part or the part that I'd like to
[1:02:47] express to you first. And I guess maybe
[1:02:50] you let out regular time about 9:30 or
[1:02:52] something like that, like each night.
[1:02:56] Well, I'll try not to keep you long.
[1:02:58] Tomorrow, Saturday, and it's a big
[1:02:59] commercial day. But now,
[1:03:03] uh, we have to get our groceries and so
[1:03:05] forth.
[1:03:06] I want to say to brother Neville
[1:03:08] publicly now I I want to say to each one
[1:03:11] of you just like I was talking privately
[1:03:13] to you just each one because you're a
[1:03:16] group that that's uh I really think that
[1:03:20] and believe and teach that man God has
[1:03:23] made man leadership of his church of his
[1:03:26] people. See, and it's uh as I was
[1:03:29] preaching down to brother um Juny
[1:03:32] Jackson's last night about God fortified
[1:03:35] his his people with his word. And it was
[1:03:39] a woman that broke through that line and
[1:03:41] give vent to reason. And when he did,
[1:03:43] God forever has always placed it for his
[1:03:48] uh for man to keep his church fortified
[1:03:51] by word. Now
[1:03:55] uh I want to encourage brother Neville
[1:03:58] just a little talking to him privately.
[1:04:00] I noticed last night the zer has struck
[1:04:02] me till three times I was in the pull
[1:04:03] pit and I turned around because I'm
[1:04:06] trying to keep as far away from it as I
[1:04:08] can until I find out what the dream
[1:04:10] meant to me here not long ago. A few
[1:04:12] weeks ago it stuck with me for a long
[1:04:15] time. I told it here in the church about
[1:04:17] something about the message and and
[1:04:20] discernment and so forth. It just didn't
[1:04:22] just wasn't coming out right. To my
[1:04:25] opinion, that time's over. And um I may
[1:04:29] be wrong on that. But I noticed that it
[1:04:32] um Brother Neville was kind of weary and
[1:04:36] upset. And I just want you to know,
[1:04:39] Brother Neville, that you're only
[1:04:41] anticipating in this fellowship in that.
[1:04:44] Have you just noticed what Satan's tried
[1:04:46] to do in the last few days to what
[1:04:48] ministers that's associated in this
[1:04:50] fellowship?
[1:04:51] Just stop for a few minutes and wonder.
[1:04:53] Here says, "Brother Craig sitting here
[1:04:54] tonight almost killed up there on the
[1:04:57] road." See, and uh I almost had my head
[1:05:00] blow off with a shotgun or with a rifle.
[1:05:03] See, Satan trying to take us and there
[1:05:06] you crashed right in and could have
[1:05:07] killed yourself and some woman also.
[1:05:10] See, just the ministers. Look at just
[1:05:13] the the ministering group.
[1:05:16] It's Satan
[1:05:18] and he's trying to get rid of us.
[1:05:22] Now, we are realize that we're not
[1:05:25] assembled here to talk on some kind of a
[1:05:27] business. We're here to assemble to talk
[1:05:30] on the on Christ and the hopes to take a
[1:05:34] hold and what to do for this present
[1:05:38] time.
[1:05:39] And I I want to encourage you, brother
[1:05:42] Neville. Uh be courageous.
[1:05:46] No matter what comes up, what goes, what
[1:05:48] takes place, just don't let nothing
[1:05:50] beset you. Just stand there like a rock
[1:05:52] of ages and God will make everything
[1:05:55] come out all right. He's proved that to
[1:05:57] you. Of course, you that could have
[1:05:59] upset you. That could have killed that
[1:06:00] woman and had been on your mind the rest
[1:06:02] of your days and it had been a lot of
[1:06:03] things. But God is still on the throne.
[1:06:05] He He lets those things work out all
[1:06:07] right. It could have taken us too. And
[1:06:10] um
[1:06:12] so Satan fighting at the church.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Now when I laid that cornerstone there
[1:06:18] that morning, I never felt that I'd ever
[1:06:22] be a pastor. It wasn't in my callings at
[1:06:25] the beginning. And my first call was to
[1:06:28] be on the field of evangelism as many
[1:06:31] years ago and started off over here in a
[1:06:34] tent just across the street. And I
[1:06:37] remember when brother Roy Davis down
[1:06:39] there and his church burnt down, that
[1:06:40] bunch of people were just like scattered
[1:06:42] sheep without a shepherd. Had no place
[1:06:44] to go. And I Mr. Hipsenberg was chief of
[1:06:48] police then and he called me down there.
[1:06:50] He said to me, uh, we're here to help
[1:06:52] you. Said, I'm Catholic myself, but said
[1:06:54] them people said they don't probably
[1:06:56] have the closes during the time of the
[1:06:58] depression. Said they go to other
[1:06:59] churches and they feel out of place and
[1:07:01] they're good people. I know many of
[1:07:02] them. He said, "Billy, if you wanted to
[1:07:05] start a church," he said, 'I want you to
[1:07:06] know that we're behind you and anything
[1:07:07] we can do to help you. And I thanked him
[1:07:11] for it. We had a tag day first. We
[1:07:13] prayed and asked the Lord and people
[1:07:16] come to me and wanted to build a church
[1:07:18] so I could have a place to go. And uh we
[1:07:21] decided this place and one night along
[1:07:23] this time we're a little further here in
[1:07:24] a pile of horse weeds right along in
[1:07:26] here and water this ditch and just had
[1:07:29] been a like a dump like well the Lord
[1:07:32] spoke to me definitely and said build it
[1:07:34] right here not a penny of money and
[1:07:37] among us we had about about 80 cents or
[1:07:40] a dollar and that of course you would
[1:07:42] laugh at that now but brother that was
[1:07:44] some money then when some neighbor cook
[1:07:47] a pot of beans and get the neighbor
[1:07:49] hadn't had enough two, three days, come
[1:07:50] over and eat a few of them. That was
[1:07:53] hard times. A lot of the young fellas
[1:07:55] ever seen that. Well, that was
[1:07:57] hardgoing.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; I've seen a time that you could pass
[1:08:00] through this church, a collection plate
[1:08:02] two times or three, and get 30 cents out
[1:08:05] of a place packed full and beg for it.
[1:08:07] It would you probably got 30 cents and
[1:08:09] had a good offering. It's really rough
[1:08:12] going. And we had nothing to deal with
[1:08:15] yet. the the desire of the people was to
[1:08:18] build a church so he could have a place
[1:08:19] to go because in them days the message
[1:08:23] well you think it's badly thought of now
[1:08:25] you ought to know it then when there's
[1:08:27] nobody and then this water baptism in
[1:08:30] the name of Jesus Christ and the
[1:08:32] blessings and things that we believe in
[1:08:34] and stand for
[1:08:36] so upon my heart I made a a promise to
[1:08:40] God that we would stay here and build
[1:08:42] the tabernacle the morning we laid the
[1:08:44] cornerstone stone. He met me over there
[1:08:46] in a vision about 8:00 that morning when
[1:08:49] I was sitting there watching out across
[1:08:50] the sun coming up just about this time
[1:08:53] of year. And he had told me
[1:08:56] after he had met me down there on the
[1:08:59] river with that when the angel of the
[1:09:01] Lord appeared in that that light and I
[1:09:05] seen it in the distance. it looked like
[1:09:06] a star and it come right down over where
[1:09:08] I was and then notable words was spoken
[1:09:11] and uh so then I purposed then to get a
[1:09:15] place for the people to worship him. Now
[1:09:17] I thought myself it ain't for me it's
[1:09:21] nothing to me but yet anything that's
[1:09:25] con pertaining to God
[1:09:28] is part of me. No matter if it's
[1:09:32] anything that's it's uh for God's
[1:09:35] children, it's for me whether it's my
[1:09:38] duty to do this or do that. It's my duty
[1:09:40] to see to God's heritage regardless of
[1:09:42] where it's at. See,
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; just like you say, well, my like as a
[1:09:46] little boy, he say my my business is
[1:09:48] just to chop the wood, not pack it in.
[1:09:50] Let John pack it in. I don't care if
[1:09:52] snow falls or it rains. Let him get out
[1:09:54] and get it. and all it's your duty as a
[1:09:57] as um a child of that home to see that
[1:10:00] that wood don't get wet for your mother.
[1:10:02] See, pack it in. If they say, "Well,
[1:10:05] Frank should have went and got the
[1:10:07] water." It ain't my business. But if
[1:10:08] Frank didn't get the water, it's your
[1:10:10] business to take care of the water.
[1:10:11] That's all. Uh that's just the way it
[1:10:13] runs. And that's the way it runs in
[1:10:15] God's family, too. If some of them some
[1:10:17] of them said the other not long ago
[1:10:19] said, "Quit preaching the way you are.
[1:10:21] My goodness, you're going to ruin every
[1:10:22] friend you got." and everything like
[1:10:23] that said let that alone I know it's
[1:10:25] wrong but my it ain't our business well
[1:10:27] whose business is it then if it's wrong
[1:10:29] somebody's got to do it
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; so let's just do it and that's the way I
[1:10:34] feel about the church the building
[1:10:36] programs and so forth has come up down
[1:10:39] up and down and there's been pro and con
[1:10:42] in the buildings and so forth one wanted
[1:10:44] the other didn't want it and this that
[1:10:46] you you find it like that you find that
[1:10:49] as you deal amongst ministers amongst
[1:10:52] businessmen man amongst lodges
[1:10:54] everywhere you go where you got a group
[1:10:56] of men. You you've got different ideas.
[1:11:00] And so therefore, you've got to have one
[1:11:04] person that you put confidence in and
[1:11:06] elect that person all work with that.
[1:11:08] It's like in the army, you've got to
[1:11:09] have one as a general. That's a
[1:11:11] headquarters. The captain says this,
[1:11:13] he's the captain of that group, but then
[1:11:15] the general can change his orders. And
[1:11:18] the chief commanding general of course
[1:11:19] is Jesus Christ in the church and his
[1:11:22] ministers are his uh captains of the
[1:11:25] companies that that's representing him
[1:11:28] here on earth and
[1:11:31] they have tried many things the little
[1:11:33] tabernacle here and finally I kept quiet
[1:11:36] in it just to see after I'd built it and
[1:11:39] then the Lord called me out into the
[1:11:42] field about 15 16 years ago and I left
[1:11:45] the church but Still, I just can't turn
[1:11:48] it out. I've always kept my name
[1:11:50] attached to it so that I could be a vote
[1:11:53] sometime. If the wrong thing got started
[1:11:56] in here, I'd have a right to come and
[1:11:58] and stop it because I've sweated it out
[1:12:01] for many years behind this pulp. It's 17
[1:12:04] years in here to keep the thing straight
[1:12:06] when all kinds of isms and ins and outs
[1:12:09] and every kind of a cult and being the
[1:12:11] inner denomination, everything that flew
[1:12:13] in, flew in this way. And by the help of
[1:12:16] God, we stood here with the
[1:12:17] unadulterated gospel and she still
[1:12:18] stands the same tonight. So we but this
[1:12:24] times that this church has been tried to
[1:12:25] be sold out from under me and everything
[1:12:27] else like that if my name wasn't
[1:12:29] attached to it down there. Why it sure
[1:12:31] would be been an awful fix tonight. Not
[1:12:33] and it wasn't me. It was God of course
[1:12:35] that did it. And then as I see it now
[1:12:39] coming into the place that it is and
[1:12:40] we're living in a great hour. It's still
[1:12:43] my interest to say something about this
[1:12:45] church. See, because it's it's a part of
[1:12:48] me. No matter whether I'm here or not,
[1:12:50] it's still a part of me. And it's my
[1:12:52] duty to see to it that it operates
[1:12:54] clean, clear, and the best I can for the
[1:12:57] kingdom of God.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And I'm very grateful that in these days
[1:13:02] I see it's got little satellites to it
[1:13:05] that I am grateful for. Brother uh Crair
[1:13:09] and his Sersburg group and brother back
[1:13:12] there that just taken brother Snelling's
[1:13:14] place at Udica and brother Ruddle up
[1:13:17] here and brother Junior Jackson and
[1:13:20] those precious boys who are fine man
[1:13:23] wonderful man of God they preach this
[1:13:26] message. Now they may one might disagree
[1:13:29] just literally up on something another
[1:13:32] that's only human amongst the group of
[1:13:33] the ministers yet and um if ministers
[1:13:37] have a little difference there won't be
[1:13:39] a a shadow of a difference in it maybe
[1:13:41] one might say I believe that the
[1:13:43] millennium will come and Jesus will be
[1:13:45] on a white horse another say I believe
[1:13:47] when he comes he'll come on a white
[1:13:48] cloud well as long as they believe he's
[1:13:50] coming that's the main thing you see no
[1:13:52] matter how he's coming just they believe
[1:13:54] he's coming and making ready for it And
[1:13:56] um that way I have tried to find out and
[1:14:01] I've been studying I told it out before
[1:14:03] the congregation.
[1:14:05] I've been studying the early church and
[1:14:08] I watched the way that those anointed
[1:14:11] men uh prepared
[1:14:13] uh the house of the Lord and the order
[1:14:16] of the Lord's worship in the house. And
[1:14:20] it struck me real real good. And I
[1:14:24] preached here some time ago and upon the
[1:14:27] subject of Joel uh two, I will restore
[1:14:31] sayaeth the Lord all the years of the
[1:14:34] palmer worm eaten and a can caterpillar
[1:14:36] and can of worm and so forth. And um I
[1:14:39] began to study on that about what these
[1:14:43] men did and the way that they um taking
[1:14:48] care of the church that God had left him
[1:14:51] overseer. Now, we're going to start off
[1:14:54] with the early church and just bring it
[1:14:57] for about five minutes now down to what
[1:14:59] they did and then I can show you the
[1:15:01] vision that I have for the future.
[1:15:04] Now at the beginning the church was
[1:15:07] inaugurated
[1:15:09] at Pentecost
[1:15:11] and there the Holy Spirit fell upon them
[1:15:13] where Jesus had chosen 12
[1:15:17] and one of them had fallen and they
[1:15:19] chose methenus to take his place and the
[1:15:22] Holy Spirit waited until all this was an
[1:15:26] order before it come. They had to choose
[1:15:29] one to take the bishopy of of Judas that
[1:15:32] fell by transgression to fulfill the
[1:15:34] scripture. And I believe that all these
[1:15:37] things has a time of lingering waiting
[1:15:41] but it's waiting for a time for the
[1:15:44] scripture to be fulfilled that
[1:15:46] everything gets right everything in
[1:15:47] order. Waiting. Many times we get p
[1:15:50] impatient like a child. We great get
[1:15:53] great anticipations and many times jump
[1:15:56] way ahead and that that just hinders the
[1:15:58] work until the work gets caught up. See,
[1:16:01] we must just move reverently, have a
[1:16:04] purpose in heart that God if he would
[1:16:07] desire to use us and such and such, but
[1:16:10] wait till he makes the opening cause he
[1:16:13] has to go be ahead of us. You remember
[1:16:16] David going to battle that night? He was
[1:16:18] weary about that fight and he laid under
[1:16:21] those malleberry trees until he heard
[1:16:23] the Lord and the rumbling of the leaves
[1:16:25] going before him. Then he went with
[1:16:27] courage
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; because he know that God had gone before
[1:16:31] him. And if we only do that, brethren,
[1:16:33] knowing the battle must come, but we
[1:16:36] must wait till we see the hand of God
[1:16:40] going before us to make a way. Amen.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:16:44] I notice that how the churches the
[1:16:47] evangelism started scattering out
[1:16:50] everywhere and then we'll take for
[1:16:52] instance the Paul becoming a great
[1:16:56] missionary to our people.
[1:16:58] We find out that he went about wherever
[1:17:02] the Lord led him and he established the
[1:17:05] church and it was a new faith. the
[1:17:08] churches of those days like in Asia
[1:17:11] Minor all throughout Europe they they
[1:17:15] didn't believe that message and when he
[1:17:18] had preached the message
[1:17:21] and many was converted to it then there
[1:17:24] was no one if he left the people in that
[1:17:28] condition they'd wander right back out
[1:17:30] into their pagan gods and into Judaism
[1:17:32] and whatever more because the people had
[1:17:35] no one to teach them the the converts,
[1:17:38] they had no place to go. So Paul
[1:17:42] established churches in different parts
[1:17:44] of the country. Each one of these
[1:17:46] churches, he left someone who was an
[1:17:50] order, a man that was trustworthy,
[1:17:54] a man that was known as a pastor,
[1:17:58] shepherd or
[1:18:01] u then after this church then become
[1:18:06] other little churches come out of it,
[1:18:09] young man and old man raised up and
[1:18:11] become churches out of that. The man
[1:18:14] that was over the first church was
[1:18:17] called the bishop.
[1:18:19] And then his that went out from him, his
[1:18:23] children was called shepherds or
[1:18:26] pastors. And then this group of little
[1:18:29] churches all would come back to this
[1:18:31] bishop. Like in the time of Ireinius, he
[1:18:35] carried on the same thing. Martin
[1:18:38] carried on the same thing. Polocart
[1:18:41] carried on the same thing. right on down
[1:18:43] through the age. They had that. And then
[1:18:46] the apostle of the church, the apostle,
[1:18:50] that was the Paul. And when Paul left,
[1:18:55] John took over the church. And when John
[1:18:59] left, Polocarp taking it over. When
[1:19:02] Polocarp left, Arinius taken it over.
[1:19:05] And on down, Martin and so forth. This
[1:19:09] kept on going until the Roman Catholic
[1:19:11] Church broke the whole thing to pieces
[1:19:13] and burn them and scattered them and the
[1:19:16] polymer worm eat this and the canker
[1:19:18] worm eat that and so forth eat that and
[1:19:20] eat that until it brought it plum down
[1:19:22] to a stall. Now, but God promised to
[1:19:26] restore
[1:19:27] again that same thing.
[1:19:30] I have I do believe with all my heart
[1:19:35] that we're living in the last days.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; I believe that there there's not too
[1:19:42] much would break this anything and my
[1:19:45] interpretation may be wrong of the
[1:19:48] scriptures
[1:19:50] that Jesus could not come tonight. I
[1:19:53] believe it and what little's left to be
[1:19:54] fulfilled could be fulfilled before
[1:19:56] daylight in the morning.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; And I'd see and I may be wrong on the
[1:20:00] time of that fulfilling but it's at
[1:20:04] hand.
[1:20:06] The I believe that
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; and remember Paul believed that, John
[1:20:11] believed that, Polocart believed that,
[1:20:13] Ireneius believed that, Martin believed
[1:20:15] that, all the rest of them believe that.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; What if God would have told John the
[1:20:20] Revelator? Now, it's going to be 2,000
[1:20:23] years before my coming. John would have
[1:20:27] come back and told the church, "Well,
[1:20:30] I guess we might as well eat, drink, be
[1:20:32] merry, cause going to be many
[1:20:33] generations." See, uh, Jesus ain't
[1:20:36] coming for 2,000 years. See, so see, the
[1:20:40] church have been loose. There have been
[1:20:43] no on the mark.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; There have been no waiting. After all,
[1:20:48] it's your anticipations. If you fall
[1:20:50] asleep in that watch that you wake with
[1:20:53] them same anticipations because they
[1:20:54] ain't going to hinder one thing, you're
[1:20:56] going to be right there on time anyhow.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; See what I mean?
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; When when St. Martin awakes in the
[1:21:03] resurrection. St. Paul, all the rest of
[1:21:06] them, it'll be just as fresh as if they
[1:21:08] was right in the battle battling right
[1:21:10] away cuz he went right down under those
[1:21:12] same anticipations looking for his
[1:21:14] coming and there'll be a screen coming
[1:21:16] up will come the whole church. You see,
[1:21:18] that'll be it. So, it doesn't matter.
[1:21:20] See, we've got to be looking for him
[1:21:23] right now.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; Even we don't know it. It could be
[1:21:27] possibly it could be a hundred years
[1:21:29] from now. It could be 500 years, a
[1:21:32] thousand years, 10,000 years. I don't
[1:21:34] know. Nobody knows. But say for instance
[1:21:38] that we live each day that he was coming
[1:21:41] that day. If we live like he was coming
[1:21:44] this day when we awake, if we sleep and
[1:21:47] we awake in the resurrection, it'll be
[1:21:49] just as fresh as if we just fallen
[1:21:51] asleep. Just woke up.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; The trumpet will sound. The dead in
[1:21:54] Christ shall rise first. We which are
[1:21:56] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:21:57] together with him to meet the Lord in
[1:21:59] air. See? So be just as fresh. But now
[1:22:03] until that time, until he comes, we want
[1:22:07] to live each day like he might come the
[1:22:11] next minute because it might be the end
[1:22:13] of your life at that minute.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; You don't know when you're going. This
[1:22:18] may be some of our last breath. We have
[1:22:21] it in us now.
[1:22:23] So you want to live like it is. But now
[1:22:27] to carry on further, we've got to put
[1:22:31] footprints here on the sands of time
[1:22:34] that others can see. If Paul hadn't went
[1:22:37] on the way he did, then John wouldn't
[1:22:40] know how to follow. If John hadn't went
[1:22:42] on, Polocart wouldn't have known how to
[1:22:44] follow. If Polocarp wouldn't have went
[1:22:46] on, Ireinius wouldn't know how to
[1:22:48] follow. If Ireinius wouldn't have went
[1:22:50] on, Martin would have known how to
[1:22:51] follow. See what I mean? Each one has to
[1:22:55] put footprints on the sands of time.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Well, if I thought that there was a
[1:23:03] denomination or any other group of
[1:23:05] believers that had anything better than
[1:23:09] we have here, brethren, I would have
[1:23:13] want to emerge this little body with it
[1:23:15] right quick. I've waited. I have longed.
[1:23:18] I have been under anticipations and
[1:23:21] believe that some great one was coming
[1:23:23] someday or maybe the great prophet that
[1:23:26] I speak will come of the Elijah. I've
[1:23:30] always believed and thought maybe that
[1:23:33] maybe I'd live to see the day that when
[1:23:34] I could change when I'd see that person
[1:23:37] rise on the scene then I could take my
[1:23:40] little church and say, "Brethren,
[1:23:42] this is the man we have looked for. This
[1:23:45] man, he is the one. I've waited for
[1:23:48] that. And if actually that has passed,
[1:23:53] then I'm looking to say it from up here.
[1:23:55] Brethren, this is the one coming from
[1:23:58] here. See, and uh I want to see the
[1:24:01] church kept up like that. I must have
[1:24:04] stepped on something or done something
[1:24:06] and put a lot of uh more uh life in that
[1:24:09] thing. So um now I would like to say
[1:24:14] this that now that this is an
[1:24:17] established church
[1:24:19] let me just stop again just a moment
[1:24:21] when I went to Bombay I count that my
[1:24:25] greatest meeting because of the effects
[1:24:27] it had on the people and I if in Africa
[1:24:31] they say 30,000 came to Christ at one
[1:24:34] time then there was 150 or 200,000 came
[1:24:38] to Christ at one time out of had half a
[1:24:40] million there.
[1:24:42] What could I do? There wasn't a thing
[1:24:45] perhaps maybe say there was just say
[1:24:47] there's 100,000 of them. There was no
[1:24:50] church, nothing I could do. There's
[1:24:51] nobody to give to them. The message I
[1:24:54] believe I there wasn't even a
[1:24:56] Pentecostal denomination would cooperate
[1:24:58] with me. And all those souls probably
[1:25:01] drifted right back into Sikhs, Jans,
[1:25:03] Buddhism, whatever more they come from.
[1:25:06] No place to put them. Now that's a
[1:25:08] shame.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; that's a disgrace.
[1:25:12] See, because I had no cooperation
[1:25:14] because of the stand that I take.
[1:25:17] Well, in Africa, I went in there under
[1:25:20] that opaces of the uh the um the AFM
[1:25:26] and African faith missions. And what I
[1:25:30] did, of course, I can't agree with them.
[1:25:31] They they baptized people in a triune
[1:25:34] baptism three times space forward.
[1:25:36] mother and baptizes three times
[1:25:38] backwards. One for one God the Father
[1:25:40] and the other for another God the Son,
[1:25:42] the other for another God the Holy Ghost
[1:25:44] and baptiz them three different times
[1:25:46] for three different gods and all such
[1:25:49] stuff as that and perhaps the Durban
[1:25:51] meeting
[1:25:53] not having it rightly and the people see
[1:25:55] such a scattered amongst the Pentecostal
[1:25:58] faiths and so forth the people didn't
[1:26:00] know what to do. They had no place to
[1:26:01] go. Perhaps what if we just had a
[1:26:04] revival here, brethren? Let me place it
[1:26:06] like this. What if we just got through
[1:26:08] with a big revival and you brethren had
[1:26:10] just got converted and there wasn't a
[1:26:11] church of this type in the country
[1:26:13] nowhere. And I've been the evangelist
[1:26:15] and now I'm leaving out. You may never
[1:26:17] see me again.
[1:26:19] What would you do? You'd feel like you
[1:26:22] wouldn't know what to do. You can't go
[1:26:25] back to that waller again. You can't go
[1:26:27] back down there with uh with your wives
[1:26:30] to wear shorts and your and uh to your
[1:26:33] card parties and dances and things like
[1:26:36] that and ever be satisfied again. You've
[1:26:38] come to life.
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; You've raised above that thing. You've
[1:26:43] come to a place instead of saying this
[1:26:45] is our creed saying this is God's word
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; and you've come to live by this what
[1:26:50] this says and not what and you go down
[1:26:53] there and listen to them and hear them
[1:26:55] go down play bunko and have a dance and
[1:26:57] this that and the other a little bit of
[1:26:59] message that had nothing in it about
[1:27:00] some mayor or something or was going to
[1:27:02] be reelected or some kind of a political
[1:27:05] affair and cut off in 10 or 15 minutes
[1:27:07] after you've been sitting here day after
[1:27:09] day in great gastronomical jubilees of
[1:27:12] the burden things you wouldn't know what
[1:27:14] to do. You'd be so burdened with it that
[1:27:16] some of you lay members would feel like
[1:27:18] starting up a church and start preaching
[1:27:20] yourself because your heart would burn
[1:27:23] for the word of God and you'd feel bad
[1:27:25] for the people that felt the same way
[1:27:27] you did.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; Though you know Jesus is coming, thought
[1:27:32] he was coming tomorrow, yet you'd want
[1:27:34] to do something today for those people
[1:27:36] who fellow citizens of the kingdom of
[1:27:38] God to come together. You want
[1:27:40] fellowship with them. That's right. So
[1:27:44] if it's this way now, I believe with all
[1:27:48] my heart that the Lord has helped me and
[1:27:52] has used me to spearhead a great
[1:27:54] revival, one of the greatest that's ever
[1:27:56] struck the world since the early days
[1:27:59] across the world. We know that. That's
[1:28:00] right. It was all gone at that time. And
[1:28:03] and he met me down there on the river
[1:28:05] and told me that the message that I had
[1:28:08] would forun the second coming of Christ.
[1:28:10] Amen.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; And I suppose there's nobody here
[1:28:13] tonight that was down there that day.
[1:28:15] That's been about 32 years ago when that
[1:28:18] light appeared and standing there at me
[1:28:20] looking right at it. Hundreds of people
[1:28:22] standing looking at it. You come right
[1:28:24] down and that voice spoke years later.
[1:28:26] Strange that the camera takes the same
[1:28:28] picture looks the same thing just
[1:28:30] exactly what I told you down the river.
[1:28:32] Now I may be mistaken in a lot of
[1:28:34] things, brethren, but I don't want to be
[1:28:35] a hypocrite. I want to be honest and
[1:28:37] straight with you. And then another
[1:28:40] thing,
[1:28:42] if id have went away, what would it
[1:28:44] never build a church here like that?
[1:28:45] It's hard to know what we'd had. See, if
[1:28:48] I just went on, but the God of heaven
[1:28:50] put it up on my heart to build this
[1:28:52] church here.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; And then when he called me out into
[1:28:54] evangelism, we've had pastor after
[1:28:57] pastor and so forth. But now we got a a
[1:29:00] precious brother here who's uh of the
[1:29:04] faith, believes the message. We've got
[1:29:07] other brothers out here that's believes
[1:29:09] a message haven't Am I getting too loud,
[1:29:12] brother?
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; All right, let's see. Yeah. Um had uh we
[1:29:17] got we got the material
[1:29:20] and now you say, "Well, brother
[1:29:22] Brandham, if they won't hear these signs
[1:29:25] and wonders of the great God of heaven,
[1:29:27] how we going to do it?" Well, now what
[1:29:30] if St. Paul would have had that same
[1:29:32] idea? See what? But he didn't. those
[1:29:36] bishops stay just as loyal to the
[1:29:38] message and they and Paul ever so often
[1:29:42] after making his round you've read the
[1:29:44] Bible how you visit back with these
[1:29:46] churches talk with the pastors and with
[1:29:48] the bishops and so forth and tough uh
[1:29:51] relief from the people and and had a oh
[1:29:55] just a great time of fellowship like a
[1:29:57] revival or a big time of jubilee and the
[1:29:59] holy spirit would fall upon them and
[1:30:01] messages would come look when he went
[1:30:03] down there to Philillip even his
[1:30:04] daughters prophesied and said these
[1:30:06] chains in prison waiting for the for our
[1:30:09] brother when he gets up there and no
[1:30:10] more got out in the yard and here come
[1:30:12] acus a prophet walking down looked
[1:30:15] across the street had never seen Paul
[1:30:16] before the general overseer this whole
[1:30:19] group of churches throughout Asia and he
[1:30:22] walked around and pulled a string off of
[1:30:24] his side he had his garment tied with
[1:30:27] bound his hands and said thus sayeth the
[1:30:29] Lord chains and prisons wait for the one
[1:30:32] that wore this up there see prophesy and
[1:30:34] Paul said, "I know it. I know it, but
[1:30:37] don't break my heart now. Let me finish
[1:30:39] my course." He was tired. He was
[1:30:42] finished. And he was going on and
[1:30:44] leaving his bishop with Timothy. Now, we
[1:30:48] got to think of young people. We got
[1:30:51] children.
[1:30:53] Most of us people here, married man has
[1:30:55] children. Well, what about them? It's
[1:30:58] coming on. See, like I used to kick up
[1:31:02] down there about them throwing those
[1:31:03] cast nets on the river and pulling out
[1:31:05] them perch and the drinks drunkards and
[1:31:07] things. I've seen them piled high as
[1:31:09] this ceiling here. Big fine perch laying
[1:31:11] there to stink bee all around the river.
[1:31:13] I went out as a game warden to make him
[1:31:15] stop it. I got a letter alone. What are
[1:31:17] you going to do? It belongs to Kentucky.
[1:31:19] Now Kentucky warden can't come over here
[1:31:22] because he's out of his territory.
[1:31:24] Indiana warden has nothing to say into
[1:31:26] it because the water belongs to
[1:31:27] Kentucky. There you are. Nothing to be
[1:31:30] done. I said, "I've got a boy coming on
[1:31:32] like the fish." While they put his
[1:31:34] picture in the paper, if he caught a
[1:31:35] chub, 20 years now, let that go on like
[1:31:38] that. Those nets, traps, and everything
[1:31:40] else. It's practically getting like that
[1:31:41] right now. See, what's the matter?
[1:31:44] You've got to think of these as coming
[1:31:45] on. So, we've got to think of the others
[1:31:48] that's coming on behind us, these young
[1:31:50] people, and so forth. And a place for
[1:31:52] our children, our daughters. We don't
[1:31:54] want them out in the world and these
[1:31:56] things like that. We want them girls
[1:31:58] raised like their mothers and we've got
[1:32:00] to make arrangements for that. And if
[1:32:02] there is no tomorrow, we don't know
[1:32:04] that. If there is no tomorrow, we
[1:32:06] haven't done nothing but been at the
[1:32:07] master's business and been found at our
[1:32:09] post of duty when he does come.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; See, so I would suggest this. I did
[1:32:14] brother Neville. Let's carry this on
[1:32:18] just as we have.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Let's let it just the way it is. I'm
[1:32:22] grateful for these young ministers. See
[1:32:25] actually at the day of judgment for this
[1:32:28] entire valleys to hear there will be no
[1:32:30] excuse because we've got little churches
[1:32:33] setting out everywhere
[1:32:36] outpost listening post waiting last
[1:32:40] night as brothers church and asked if
[1:32:43] all in there was 45 behind the word and
[1:32:47] every hand went up. Now that made me
[1:32:49] feel good.
[1:33:03] If you have opportunity to this
[1:33:06] afternoon to go back,
[1:33:08] he'll finish the rest of it. It's about
[1:33:12] another 25
[1:33:14] uh 30 minutes. Uh there's quite a few
[1:33:19] tremendous remarks in there, but
[1:33:24] you notice he said,
[1:33:27] and I I I liked how he closed it. He
[1:33:30] said, I would suggest
[1:33:33] this. I did to brother Neville. Let's
[1:33:37] carry this on just as we have it.
[1:33:44] And so the the importance
[1:33:49] of it is and th this is out of the
[1:33:51] message taking sides with Jesus
[1:33:56] is
[1:33:58] he laid out the pattern of the church to
[1:34:01] us and and we know that pattern that it
[1:34:06] was laid out in the first chapters of
[1:34:08] Revelation
[1:34:10] that when John saw the vision he saw a
[1:34:12] great candlestick
[1:34:15] And the the c the Lord was standing in
[1:34:17] the midst of the candlestick and there
[1:34:19] were seven stars, seven candles and they
[1:34:22] all drew the wick from the same spot
[1:34:25] within their uh and where their flame
[1:34:29] was burning. And we knew that those
[1:34:31] seven stars and those se those seven
[1:34:34] candles were the seven church ages. The
[1:34:36] seven stars were the messengers of the
[1:34:39] church age and and So we understood that
[1:34:45] God had a a plan and it it was hard
[1:34:50] because the the we know from our church
[1:34:53] history that the gospel began to dim and
[1:34:57] and from what was what was what the
[1:35:00] church first church was.
[1:35:03] It's hard to believe that all the world
[1:35:06] knew as Christianity was the Roman
[1:35:08] Catholic Church.
[1:35:11] What went into the ground at the day of
[1:35:13] Pentecost
[1:35:15] now had went into such darkness. And we
[1:35:18] know that horse riders were not talking
[1:35:20] about that this morning. It went into
[1:35:23] such darkness
[1:35:25] that the what the people's idea
[1:35:29] of the church was.
[1:35:32] In other words, what they thought God
[1:35:33] was, they're they're sincere. Now, you
[1:35:37] understand? They're not evil. they're
[1:35:39] not that they want to serve God, but if
[1:35:42] they if they weren't taught right and
[1:35:45] they didn't know any better and and and
[1:35:48] God didn't intervene with them directly
[1:35:51] through some divine uh inspiration, they
[1:35:55] would naturally as human being presume
[1:35:58] this is right. This is what we do. We go
[1:36:02] to a priest. We kneel down. We confess
[1:36:06] our sins to the priest. He tells us to
[1:36:09] do something. Go light a candle. Go do a
[1:36:13] good work. Go say a prayer. And then our
[1:36:16] sins will be recovered. And so we would
[1:36:19] we would naturally follow that because
[1:36:23] we believe and have faith in it that
[1:36:27] that's the right way. They're sincere
[1:36:32] and we know that God will honor
[1:36:34] sincerity. Any that's in this message.
[1:36:37] You can go read it. He'll honor anybody
[1:36:40] that's sincere. They can be sincerely
[1:36:43] wrong, but yet God will honor their
[1:36:46] sincerity. That's the grace and the
[1:36:49] mercy of of of the Lord. And and so the
[1:36:54] church was in darkness.
[1:36:56] And then the church, we know that it
[1:36:58] began to revive up. It began to come up.
[1:37:02] Luther came on the scene. And he brought
[1:37:04] a a revelation to the church that no,
[1:37:09] you don't have to confess your sins to
[1:37:11] the priest. No, that isn't the literal
[1:37:14] body and blood of Jesus Christ. Can you
[1:37:16] imagine being a Catholic all your life?
[1:37:20] You've paid thousands of dollars for
[1:37:22] your sins. You've lit You've lit
[1:37:25] hundreds of candles. You've prayed to
[1:37:27] every saint in the book. You know what I
[1:37:31] mean? Which there's dozens and dozens of
[1:37:33] them. And one day you get a divine
[1:37:36] revelation that Jesus Christ's blood
[1:37:39] paid the price from all your sins. That
[1:37:42] you don't have to pay that price for
[1:37:44] that sin.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; That that sin was forgiven from you.
[1:37:48] Well, you were yet a sinner. He died for
[1:37:50] you, covering your sin. and you
[1:37:53] understood that you could be free from
[1:37:55] that burden
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; and that there was one sacrifice for sin
[1:38:02] and that that that you didn't have to
[1:38:04] live under that that you weren't subject
[1:38:07] to that. In other words, when you were a
[1:38:10] Catholic, it wasn't until you performed
[1:38:13] the penance
[1:38:15] that the absolution was any good. So I
[1:38:19] could tell you as a priest now you go
[1:38:21] you go say four Hail Marys, four glory
[1:38:24] bees, four our fathers and and and then
[1:38:28] you know and I'll absolut but if you
[1:38:30] didn't do the the penance then the
[1:38:33] forgiveness wasn't any good.
[1:38:37] What kind of forgiveness is that?
[1:38:40] I'll forgive you if you do this for me.
[1:38:43] No. Can you imagine? It was wonderful.
[1:38:48] It was glorious. They came out of the
[1:38:50] church. Luther began to talk about being
[1:38:53] justified, the justification by the
[1:38:57] grace of God. It was by grace and mercy,
[1:39:00] not by works.
[1:39:02] Of course, then that because there was
[1:39:04] nobody to take him any further
[1:39:07] that began to get mixed up with the
[1:39:10] ideas of man and all men started coming
[1:39:13] in. They started teaching it. They
[1:39:15] started adding to it. They started doing
[1:39:18] all this and it got all mixed up. But
[1:39:20] remember, there is a pure word of God.
[1:39:24] There is a pure will of God.
[1:39:28] That's what you we've got to remember.
[1:39:32] man's always added to it and taken away
[1:39:35] from it and added to it and tried to
[1:39:37] improve it and and everything,
[1:39:41] you know, they always want to add a
[1:39:43] little bit, you know, add a little
[1:39:45] spice, add a little this, add a little
[1:39:47] that, make it better for the people,
[1:39:49] some way where they could attach
[1:39:51] themselves to it in some manner.
[1:39:55] Well, it got messed up. And then then
[1:39:58] John Wesley came on the scene and he
[1:40:02] began to preach, hey, you not only you
[1:40:04] got to live right, you got to live
[1:40:06] clean. You got to live just. Sure, your
[1:40:09] sins are forgiven.
[1:40:11] You know what I mean? But if your sins
[1:40:13] are forgiven, then you ought to have a
[1:40:15] life that represents that.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; And he began to preach sanctification,
[1:40:21] what it meant. A and he preached, you
[1:40:24] know, we just throw it in one big
[1:40:26] category, but the teachings of John
[1:40:29] Wesley were was about discipline,
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; about sacrifice,
[1:40:36] about about order in your life. You
[1:40:41] know, it just wasn't happy golucky. You
[1:40:44] know, they they said he prayed till his
[1:40:46] eyes were well and shut. That's what he
[1:40:49] taught the church. There's discipline.
[1:40:51] You get up in the morning, you do your
[1:40:53] prayers, you you sanctify, you make
[1:40:55] things right, you you you stay away from
[1:40:58] the appearance of evil. uh you do those
[1:41:01] are things that were taught
[1:41:04] because they were lacking
[1:41:07] because when they got the revelation of
[1:41:09] justification
[1:41:11] and they went forward they were so
[1:41:14] grateful for justification they didn't
[1:41:17] know that they needed to take care of
[1:41:19] the other things then God sent them a
[1:41:22] message take care of these things too
[1:41:26] take care of these things be right be
[1:41:29] good let your light shine. Don't give
[1:41:31] anybody an occasion to give you an
[1:41:34] accusation.
[1:41:35] And that came up
[1:41:38] and then then we know that that people
[1:41:42] begin to seek out the gifts back into
[1:41:46] the church.
[1:41:48] And they called that Pentecost. That
[1:41:50] wasn't the original Pentecost. That was
[1:41:53] nothing other than the restoration of
[1:41:56] gifts.
[1:41:57] Some people said that they began to
[1:41:59] pray. The spirit of God began to move on
[1:42:01] them. They spoke in tongues. That was
[1:42:04] great. Uh they they saw things. God
[1:42:07] dealt with their heart. That should
[1:42:08] still be in the church. Were not never
[1:42:10] taken away from the church. But man
[1:42:13] began to get a hold of it again. And
[1:42:15] then they begin to say that tongues was
[1:42:17] the evidence of the Holy Spirit. And
[1:42:19] that that the leadership of the feeling
[1:42:22] of the spirit, the spirit moving upon
[1:42:25] you had greater value than what the
[1:42:29] scripture said.
[1:42:32] And there became a divide
[1:42:35] between the word of God and the spirit
[1:42:38] of God.
[1:42:40] People were feeling led to do things
[1:42:43] that were contrary to the word.
[1:42:49] because they felt it.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; They were anointed.
[1:42:54] They were in that anointing. They were
[1:42:56] in that leadership. And and the
[1:42:58] leadership part of it was true, but the
[1:43:01] man part of it was what messed it up.
[1:43:05] The flesh part of it messed it up. The
[1:43:08] spirit of God will never lead lead you
[1:43:11] contrary to the word of God. Now, we all
[1:43:14] make mistakes. I've made lots of
[1:43:17] mistakes. I've done a lot of things I'm
[1:43:19] a
[1:43:21] ashamed of that I didn't know. I used my
[1:43:24] own wisdom. I didn't wait it out like
[1:43:27] the prophet of God said until God made a
[1:43:29] way. I went ahead and jumped in and went
[1:43:32] ahead and tried to handle it myself. I
[1:43:34] couldn't wait. You know, that impatience
[1:43:38] is the hardest thing for us as
[1:43:40] believers. The whole church got
[1:43:42] impatient. waiting for God, the spirit
[1:43:44] to maneuver. And we all went out and
[1:43:46] created a great big mess in this message
[1:43:49] with emotions and trying to establish
[1:43:52] the gifts and everything in the church.
[1:43:54] And God's got an order to things. He's
[1:43:57] got a way that works. And now what we're
[1:43:59] doing is we're waiting for the work to
[1:44:01] catch up.
[1:44:06] We've all tried to burn down the
[1:44:07] building with evangelism and with
[1:44:10] anointing and with with fire.
[1:44:14] It's just caused a big problem.
[1:44:17] It always causes disunityity.
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; And then we we know that that went
[1:44:24] through that and Pentecost just blew up
[1:44:26] into all kinds of things. The prophet of
[1:44:28] God even talks about it. He talked about
[1:44:30] the two buckets. He said he had the
[1:44:34] oneness and he had the the the
[1:44:36] assemblies with the trinitarians. And he
[1:44:39] said, "I never cross those buckets. I
[1:44:41] let those trees grow up the same." He
[1:44:43] says, "Because they were both wrong."
[1:44:48] And so we we find out that then
[1:44:53] the church was in a mess.
[1:44:58] Pentecostal church got in a mess. Women
[1:45:01] preachers everywhere, all kinds of
[1:45:04] things. And then God sent us a
[1:45:06] messenger.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; That's what he did.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; He sent somebody to come back and
[1:45:14] restore it back. Now everybody thinks he
[1:45:19] retried he didn't restore it back to the
[1:45:21] emotion. He didn't restore it back to
[1:45:24] the feeling. He restored it back to the
[1:45:27] word.
[1:45:29] That's what he restored it back to the
[1:45:31] way it's be to be in the word of God.
[1:45:36] And in this particular message, the
[1:45:38] prophet of God has found himself. And I
[1:45:41] I I could if I played it more, but I'll
[1:45:43] just put this in here for a short
[1:45:45] moment. He was told to do the work of
[1:45:49] evangelist. Now he's got a place where
[1:45:52] he feels either I'm a prophet or I'm an
[1:45:55] evangelist.
[1:45:56] They both don't work together. And he
[1:46:00] was going through this great
[1:46:02] time in his life that he had some
[1:46:06] visions and and he had a dream and and
[1:46:10] so now he's trying to make a decision.
[1:46:12] Now, by the grace of God, we can look
[1:46:14] back on that now
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; and know that he talks about I can't
[1:46:20] stay here. I've got to move on. He's
[1:46:23] letting people know what's going on in
[1:46:25] his life. And so, he went from there to
[1:46:28] Tucson.
[1:46:30] And that's where he understood now that
[1:46:33] he was going to open the seals. The
[1:46:36] sword came into his hand. He knew it was
[1:46:38] the third pull. And he he well but at
[1:46:42] this particular time the present stage
[1:46:44] of his ministry he he didn't know what
[1:46:47] what his future was but the one thing he
[1:46:50] did know he said this when if the angel
[1:46:55] came to me on the river
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; and said as your message for as John the
[1:47:01] Baptist forerrun the first coming of
[1:47:03] Christ so shall your message forerrun
[1:47:05] the second of Christ. He knew that part
[1:47:08] of it was true. And therefore, he said,
[1:47:11] if this is an established part and we
[1:47:14] know this is true and we know what we
[1:47:16] have is true, then let's stay with it.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; And that's what my heart's desire has
[1:47:29] been. Now, I want the movement of the
[1:47:31] spirit.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; I want those things in the church. I
[1:47:34] want people. But you can't leave what
[1:47:37] you got to get it. You got to wait on
[1:47:40] God to give it.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; And you've got to have the reason. Now,
[1:47:48] I'm just sharing my heart with you this
[1:47:49] morning
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; because we're in a real
[1:47:55] tremendous time in this country and the
[1:47:58] atmosphere that we're living under. this
[1:48:01] young Christian politician
[1:48:05] uh got murdered the other day and and
[1:48:08] that that that's a
[1:48:12] a sad thing
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; and and
[1:48:18] you know I'm not for that.
[1:48:21] But if you think that Trump is God's
[1:48:23] answer for this c country, you're crazy.
[1:48:30] And now the Republicans are all standing
[1:48:33] up saying, "God's on our side."
[1:48:37] &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? We're We're right.
[1:48:39] They're demons. They're evil. It's just
[1:48:42] division. Don't you know that's what God
[1:48:44] said? If a kingdom be divided against
[1:48:46] itself, it can't stand. Everybody's
[1:48:49] What? They prophesying out of their own
[1:48:51] mouth. This is the end of democracy.
[1:48:53] This is the end of America. Why do you
[1:48:56] think they're saying that? because it
[1:48:58] is.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; They've rejected God.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; They rejected the purpose they they were
[1:49:08] here. They rejected the reason the
[1:49:11] country was raised up.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; They're trying to fend defend
[1:49:17] immorality, trying to defend themselves.
[1:49:20] Everybody wants to stand up like some
[1:49:22] shining night. You know what the
[1:49:24] scripture says? A good soldier does not
[1:49:29] entangle himself with the affairs of the
[1:49:32] world.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not questioning anybody's sincerity.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; I'm not questioning conservatism
[1:49:40] versus liberalism.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; They're two different buckets.
[1:49:46] They're both wrong.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; You may feel parts of this is right. You
[1:49:54] may feel parts of that's right. They're
[1:49:57] both wrong.
[1:50:00] &gt;&gt; That's not what we're to take sides
[1:50:02] with.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; We're take we're here to take sides with
[1:50:09] Jesus.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Now, if you're going to take sides with
[1:50:15] somebody,
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; you understand? In other words, you're
[1:50:20] you're going to choose or you're going
[1:50:23] to vote
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; or and if your vote is what you promote.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Now, you vote your political conscience
[1:50:31] any way you want to. I don't care who
[1:50:34] you vote for.
[1:50:36] I'm not here to get votes
[1:50:40] for anybody.
[1:50:42] But what I am here to say is
[1:50:46] that if you take sides with Jesus,
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; then you will be about his business.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Did you hear what he said? He said, "We
[1:50:58] say that I chop the wood.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; It's John's job
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; to carry it in."
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "No. It's your job to carry it
[1:51:13] in. You're part of the family. You carry
[1:51:16] it in. If John, if Fred don't want to
[1:51:19] pack the water, you pack the water.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; But you know what we've got here? We've
[1:51:24] got a lot of no wood packers. We've got
[1:51:27] no water packers. We got people that
[1:51:30] aren't involved in the church. They
[1:51:32] don't care about nothing. They don't
[1:51:34] care about how it goes, how it works,
[1:51:36] what it takes to keep it in service.
[1:51:43] Fine.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; But what side are you on?
[1:51:55] Like the guy said,
[1:51:58] I ain't what I ought to be
[1:52:03] and I ain't what I want to be, but
[1:52:05] praise God, I ain't what I used to be.
[1:52:08] Amen.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; Like the guy that held the Bible.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; They say he was there and he he saw the
[1:52:19] he he was looking at the the display of
[1:52:22] Abraham Lincoln and he jumped back and
[1:52:24] he cried and and they said, "Why are you
[1:52:27] crying?" He said, "Well, this man's
[1:52:29] blood helped get my freedom."
[1:52:31] And they said, "Why are you holding the
[1:52:33] Bible?" He said, "You can't even read
[1:52:34] it." He says, "I want people to know
[1:52:36] what side I'm on.
[1:52:40] You know what the curse of this age is?
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; It's lukewarm.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; It's not what side are you on?
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; What's the number one priority? What do
[1:52:50] you choose above everything when the
[1:52:52] hour of decision comes? What is it that
[1:52:55] you pick above all things? Who do you
[1:52:58] follow? What do you put your effort
[1:53:00] into? What do you put your time into?
[1:53:02] What is it that moves you?
[1:53:07] And that's why this is the age of it
[1:53:09] being lukewarm.
[1:53:11] It's a it's a terrible time that we live
[1:53:15] in. It's hard.
[1:53:18] Keep talking about hard times when a
[1:53:21] neighbor would finally get enough money
[1:53:23] to make a pot of beans and everybody
[1:53:25] would come over and eat it. You know, my
[1:53:28] mom grew up in that time. I never could
[1:53:32] get it out of her.
[1:53:34] You know what I mean? She would she
[1:53:36] wouldn't want they said she told me she
[1:53:38] said we never everybody in town wouldn't
[1:53:41] want rinse their milk bottles out.
[1:53:46] You know why? Because they'd have to
[1:53:48] hire somebody to clean milk bottles.
[1:53:52] That's the way they thought of one
[1:53:54] another.
[1:53:56] Everybody was in the struggle together.
[1:53:58] Everybody was in the battle together.
[1:54:01] Everybody tried to have it work
[1:54:03] together. He said he he said we'd pass
[1:54:05] an offering in a building packed out
[1:54:07] like this and he said we get 30 cents.
[1:54:09] It wasn't because they didn't want to
[1:54:11] give. That's all they had.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; I like what he said. He said, you know,
[1:54:19] if if you fed on this word, he said, and
[1:54:23] you knew you couldn't go back to the
[1:54:25] same old garbage and eat that same old
[1:54:28] stuff. And and what do we we don't want
[1:54:30] to go back there and eat that stuff. He
[1:54:31] said you'd go out yourself and make a
[1:54:34] place that the word could good.
[1:54:38] And all I'm saying is we got a place.
[1:54:40] Let's keep it a place
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; where the word of God is.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; And if these ministers go out and they
[1:54:47] go out and they have they start places.
[1:54:49] We've had a lot of preachers come out
[1:54:51] from here that start places. Praise God.
[1:54:53] Let them stay with the word.
[1:54:57] We're all one
[1:55:00] family anyway.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; We're all waiting for the same thing.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; But my heart has always been
[1:55:09] and and I'll just tell you right now, I
[1:55:13] I'm I'm so tired
[1:55:17] of getting over and over and over again
[1:55:22] people telling me what they do.
[1:55:26] They don't do this. They don't do that.
[1:55:29] Talking about the clergy, talking about
[1:55:32] other believers in the message, talking
[1:55:34] about, oh, this, oh, you know, they
[1:55:36] don't take the word, they don't follow
[1:55:38] the word, they they've run after this,
[1:55:40] they do this, they don't believe this,
[1:55:42] they do this, blah, blah, blah. And and
[1:55:44] I I And you know what that does to me?
[1:55:48] I might agree with every of it, but
[1:55:49] there's always one thing that rises up
[1:55:51] in me. What are you doing? Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; These they might be doing something
[1:55:58] wrong, but they're doing something.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the biggest sayings for
[1:56:04] this age is just do it.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; You know where they got it from?
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Right here.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "Just do it."
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; You ought to go read the rest of this.
[1:56:24] part of that until he takes up the
[1:56:26] message. Taking sight with Jesus.
[1:56:30] Well, really,
[1:56:34] we're an established church.
[1:56:38] I mean, you come here, you sit here.
[1:56:42] What is our business
[1:56:46] really? What is it?
[1:56:48] I don't want this church to be a church
[1:56:52] that's just fighting
[1:56:55] everything that's wrong.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; You're never going to get rid of it.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; You're always going to have things come
[1:57:03] up. You're always going to have
[1:57:05] different ideas. You're always going to
[1:57:07] have guys that come through that preach
[1:57:10] a little different, say a little
[1:57:11] different. You know what what brother
[1:57:15] said in this message about Matsson and
[1:57:17] Boze?
[1:57:20] He's having Mats and Boze come to speak
[1:57:22] to his church
[1:57:25] to tell him what he had done on the
[1:57:29] mission field in Tanzanica.
[1:57:34] And he tells right in this tape, he
[1:57:35] said, "I've sat Madison and Boze down
[1:57:38] and tied him up in scripture and he
[1:57:40] knows this is the message truth." He'll
[1:57:42] say, "Yes, it's truth, Brother
[1:57:44] Brandham." But he'll just go his own
[1:57:46] way.
[1:57:48] You'll have people like that.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; But Brother Brandham loved him. Had him
[1:57:53] in his church. Amen.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Because
[1:57:58] the important thing
[1:58:02] and I I I believe that God allowed this
[1:58:06] to happen.
[1:58:08] Brother Paul heard that a child was
[1:58:12] sick, maybe his daughter's friend or
[1:58:15] school.
[1:58:16] So, he went to the hospital. She had
[1:58:19] leukemia and he prayed for her.
[1:58:25] And she was miraculously
[1:58:28] healed
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; without show,
[1:58:35] without event or nothing.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; A little girl's life was saved
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; from leukemia
[1:58:43] cuz the spirit of God moved on Paul. He
[1:58:47] had compassion in his heart and he went
[1:58:50] and prayed for her and he was obedient.
[1:58:53] to that
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; and there is a miracle,
[1:58:59] a real miracle.
[1:59:03] &gt;&gt; And that if we don't careful,
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Satan will allow us to get in the battle
[1:59:10] with our brethren, the ones that are
[1:59:13] supposedly fighting for the same cause
[1:59:16] that we're fighting for.
[1:59:18] Our
[1:59:20] focus,
[1:59:23] our being as a body of believers
[1:59:28] have been established whether you come
[1:59:31] here cuz mommy makes you or not
[1:59:36] for whatever reason
[1:59:38] that you come. But if you've had an
[1:59:42] experience with the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:59:46] the prophet of God said there's
[1:59:47] something in you that compels you to
[1:59:50] tell somebody else. Amen.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; And if our focus as a body of believers
[1:59:58] should be
[2:00:00] and our mind should be set, not on what
[2:00:04] other churches are doing,
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; not on what other brothers are
[2:00:08] preaching,
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; not on what doctrines are going around
[2:00:13] and what movements are going around.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; We purposed in our heart to stay with
[2:00:18] the message the best we can.
[2:00:23] And I could say like I said that like
[2:00:25] brother Bram said I put a lot of years
[2:00:27] of sweat in this pulpit to keep it
[2:00:31] straight.
[2:00:36] But our
[2:00:38] goal
[2:00:40] in each heart should be to get this
[2:00:44] message to this community.
[2:00:52] We should be about our father's
[2:00:56] business.
[2:00:58] That's what taking sides with Jesus is
[2:01:02] really all about.
[2:01:07] I don't want to talk against if a
[2:01:10] brother wants tongues and shouting in
[2:01:12] his church. Praise God.
[2:01:16] I don't want to straighten that out.
[2:01:18] That's my brother.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; If they want to fuss about music and
[2:01:26] argue about what songs to sing and all
[2:01:29] that, let them go.
[2:01:32] It's not my job.
[2:01:34] It's not my job. My business to
[2:01:37] straighten out the world.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will deal with each of
[2:01:42] those men as he's doing now.
[2:01:49] But our job
[2:01:53] is to go into our community
[2:01:56] and
[2:01:59] do our job
[2:02:01] of spreading this message.
[2:02:07] So if if we we have a church, we got
[2:02:10] good deacons. I know we run into little
[2:02:13] problems, you know, of kids
[2:02:17] doing their potty on the pews and you
[2:02:22] you have that and scribbling on the
[2:02:24] books and and
[2:02:27] you know, eating and all this humanistic
[2:02:31] stuff.
[2:02:33] And we'll deal with that, you know,
[2:02:36] until,
[2:02:39] you know, and the minute you get all
[2:02:40] those kids raised, they get married and
[2:02:42] have kids and you're, they bring that
[2:02:44] problem that they were back into the
[2:02:47] world. So just remember the problem that
[2:02:50] you were, you brought back into the
[2:02:53] world.
[2:02:57] You were a terrible teen. You had a
[2:03:00] teen.
[2:03:03] I remember I was my dad called me and I
[2:03:07] was there and she he asked she he says
[2:03:09] where's David? He says well he's got the
[2:03:14] toilet off of the seat and he's digging
[2:03:17] a hairbrush where the kids flushed a
[2:03:20] hairbrush down the toilet. My dad just
[2:03:23] laughed
[2:03:25] because he knew he did that for me.
[2:03:29] Just remember,
[2:03:32] somebody did it for you.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; And if we lose focus,
[2:03:39] if we don't take sides, then we lose the
[2:03:42] purpose that we're here for. If we don't
[2:03:44] pack the water for one another, if we
[2:03:47] don't pack the wood for one another, if
[2:03:50] we don't take sides with Jesus,
[2:03:54] then we're drifting
[2:03:57] down the wrong road.
[2:04:02] Signs and wonders were given to win
[2:04:05] souls.
[2:04:07] They weren't given as an evidence that
[2:04:10] you're saved
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; or that God's with you.
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; You only know God's with you by one
[2:04:17] thing is having faith in your death.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; You know God's with you because he's
[2:04:24] with you.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; I don't have to look over here or look
[2:04:29] over here to know whether God's with me
[2:04:31] or not. I got to look inside.
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:36] And when I look inside and I see there's
[2:04:38] places I go that he don't, then I have a
[2:04:42] decision to make.
[2:04:46] When I look in here and I see I do
[2:04:48] things he didn't, then I have a decision
[2:04:51] to make. You know whether he's with you.
[2:04:55] That's personal.
[2:04:58] I'm talking about our body.
[2:05:01] And I don't want our body and our hearts
[2:05:05] and our minds to be caught up in
[2:05:10] national politics
[2:05:13] or message politics.
[2:05:21] I've been in this message since
[2:05:24] 19
[2:05:27] 6970. I don't even know how long ago
[2:05:30] that is.
[2:05:32] I met a lot of men that knew Brother
[2:05:35] Benham. I've watched a lot of my friends
[2:05:38] die. The one thing that I noticed that
[2:05:41] hasn't changed is what he stored up.
[2:05:47] That's still life.
[2:05:50] And I don't I don't want to be a voice
[2:05:55] for either bucket.
[2:05:58] I don't want to be a voice
[2:06:01] for what's right and who's got the right
[2:06:04] interpretation and these guys say this
[2:06:06] and these guys say that. I won't get no
[2:06:08] more texts about it. I won't have no
[2:06:10] more conversations about it. I'm done
[2:06:13] with it.
[2:06:15] They're all my brothers. They're all
[2:06:17] right. They're all feeding. They're all
[2:06:21] doing their things. The prophet of God
[2:06:23] said, "Let every tree grow in its own
[2:06:28] bucket."
[2:06:34] My question is, what's growing in our
[2:06:38] bucket?
[2:06:42] What are we doing in this body?
[2:06:48] You can't run from America.
[2:06:51] You can't leave. I I I've
[2:06:55] you can't run from problems. They follow
[2:06:58] you. I had friends that lived in the
[2:07:01] most beautiful place in the whole wide
[2:07:03] world. You wouldn't think there was a
[2:07:05] problem in a million miles. Gorgeous,
[2:07:08] absolutely fantastic,
[2:07:11] beautiful.
[2:07:15] Just hide up in the hills. You wouldn't
[2:07:17] think there'd be no trouble.
[2:07:19] Trouble strikes.
[2:07:22] People have heart attacks.
[2:07:24] Accidents happen.
[2:07:27] The prophet of God never even told him
[2:07:29] to leave California. Do you know that
[2:07:31] what he said? He said, "Flee into Christ
[2:07:37] cuz he knew that Christ would lead them
[2:07:40] out.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; Flee into Christ. Let's be about our
[2:07:47] father's business.
[2:07:49] We're not against anybody.
[2:07:54] Let Let the preachers preach how they
[2:07:57] preach.
[2:07:59] I'm not trying to get every preacher to
[2:08:01] change his style.
[2:08:03] Let them preach.
[2:08:07] If you can eat, eat what you can eat.
[2:08:11] Spit out the seeds.
[2:08:13] But know you're absolute.
[2:08:18] Know your calling.
[2:08:21] Know the work and purpose
[2:08:25] for which God called you.
[2:08:28] Do you have a calling? Do you have a
[2:08:31] work? Are you doing something for the
[2:08:35] kingdom of God? Are you sharing the
[2:08:37] message?
[2:08:39] Are you letting your light shine?
[2:08:43] Are you furthering the kingdom?
[2:08:47] Or are you letting the wood get wet?
[2:08:52] Are you letting the
[2:08:55] water stay in the bucket?
[2:08:59] He said that's not how it is in the
[2:09:01] family of God.
[2:09:04] That's not how things go.
[2:09:07] And I think if we if in our purpose of
[2:09:10] our heart
[2:09:12] we would start taking sides with Jesus,
[2:09:16] we'd start doing things the way he did
[2:09:19] things.
[2:09:21] So I I just want to make clear
[2:09:25] what I've always longed for the last few
[2:09:28] years
[2:09:30] and in the last few years we've been
[2:09:32] caught up in the building of this church
[2:09:36] because we had to have it.
[2:09:40] I mean we just couldn't keep sticking
[2:09:42] this many people in a what we had.
[2:09:47] But if and I I I've never wanted this
[2:09:51] church to be an enson
[2:09:54] to how that we think things should be
[2:09:57] done.
[2:09:59] My heart's desire for this church has
[2:10:02] always been outreach.
[2:10:08] But it it's always been to me about
[2:10:11] outreach. What can we do
[2:10:15] for furthering this gospel?
[2:10:20] What can we do
[2:10:24] to spread this and give this great
[2:10:27] message,
[2:10:29] the last word of hope to others?
[2:10:34] Nobody can take your place. Every single
[2:10:36] one of you has a voice and a heart and
[2:10:40] feelings
[2:10:42] for people that hurt.
[2:10:45] There's somebody out in the world that's
[2:10:47] just like you.
[2:10:49] Same upbringing, same mental problems,
[2:10:52] same battles, same struggles. There's
[2:10:55] somebody that you can reach that I can
[2:10:58] never reach.
[2:11:02] The question is, are we reaching?
[2:11:06] I'm so happy with the brothers that go
[2:11:08] to the nursing home and share and give
[2:11:15] those elderly people, whether they know
[2:11:19] can remember their name tomorrow or not,
[2:11:21] they sit a few moments and they gather
[2:11:23] and they hear the word of God. To me,
[2:11:26] that's life. That's light.
[2:11:29] And I believe the Lord Jesus told us,
[2:11:32] "Let's let our light shine amongst men
[2:11:36] that our good works might glorify our
[2:11:40] father which is in heaven. Let's go into
[2:11:43] all the world and preach the gospel.
[2:11:46] Let's tell those that
[2:11:49] you you know are sick." Don't be afraid
[2:11:51] of that sickness.
[2:11:54] You might be the only hope they have by
[2:11:56] saying God's a healer. Listen
[2:12:00] to this tape. Let me pray for you. You
[2:12:04] don't know what God will do.
[2:12:06] And I'll close with this.
[2:12:12] Brother Rem said that when you die
[2:12:16] and you go to sleep, you go to sleep
[2:12:19] with the same anticipation
[2:12:22] you have on earth.
[2:12:25] You know, I've never caught that
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; before.
[2:12:30] When they wake up, they're going to wake
[2:12:32] up. Where's the coming of the Lord?
[2:12:37] He said that doesn't leave you when you
[2:12:40] die.
[2:12:42] He said it in another place, the
[2:12:44] character you go into the ground with is
[2:12:46] the character that you have. It's the
[2:12:48] only thing you bring with them. I
[2:12:50] thought that look at those. They all
[2:12:52] look forward to it.
[2:12:54] He said, "If God would have said 2,000
[2:12:56] years, we'd have all fallen asleep.
[2:13:00] But we should have an anticipation."
[2:13:03] And with that anticipation, we ought to
[2:13:05] have a love for the lost. If the Lord
[2:13:08] comes, friend, you're not ready.
[2:13:14] Let me share something with you that'll
[2:13:17] give you life,
[2:13:20] and you'll find out if you have it.
[2:13:24] Because if you got it, you want to share
[2:13:26] it.
[2:13:28] &gt;&gt; If you don't want to share it, it's a
[2:13:30] good possibility you've lost your
[2:13:33] enthusiasm.
[2:13:35] And I would read that quote about lost
[2:13:37] enthusiasm. He said, "If you've lost
[2:13:39] your enthusiasm, there's something
[2:13:42] wrong."
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; And so I say, "Lord, restore my
[2:13:46] enthusiasm."
[2:13:49] As the pastor of this church, I'm not
[2:13:52] against anybody in the message. I'm
[2:13:54] done. I want to be about lost souls.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; I want to be about letting our light
[2:14:01] shine. Being what we should be,
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; being a shining light in our life,
[2:14:12] taking care of one another, loving one
[2:14:15] another, helping one another.
[2:14:19] and let the love of God be shed abroad
[2:14:22] in our heart by the Holy Spirit. It's my
[2:14:25] heart's desire. God bless you. Let's
[2:14:28] stand this morning.
[2:14:37] The musicians would come.
[2:14:54] The brother of God said there'll be a
[2:14:56] uniting time
[2:14:58] and we're seeing it now.
[2:15:02] People's opinions are getting stronger.
[2:15:05] They're siding to different
[2:15:08] forces.
[2:15:11] But I pray with all my heart there'll be
[2:15:13] a people that will side with the work of
[2:15:15] the Lord.
[2:15:18] That's their identity. What did Jesus
[2:15:21] do?
[2:15:23] Jesus, for this cause the son of man has
[2:15:26] come into the world
[2:15:29] that he might find them that are lost
[2:15:32] and bring them to the kingdom of God
[2:15:35] that he'll might heal the sick and the
[2:15:38] brokenhearted.
[2:15:40] Well, maybe with we just bow our heads
[2:15:43] as they softly play and you just ask
[2:15:45] yourself,
[2:15:49] I don't know your life.
[2:15:51] Many of you, I've never been to your
[2:15:53] home.
[2:15:57] I don't know what you all do for a
[2:15:59] living.
[2:16:06] So, this is a question you have to ask
[2:16:09] yourself.
[2:16:12] Am I about my father's business?
[2:16:20] Am I doing my part
[2:16:26] in the body of Christ
[2:16:29] for my brothers,
[2:16:32] for my sisters,
[2:16:36] for the lost.
[2:16:46] When the eyes of heaven look down
[2:16:50] upon me,
[2:16:54] what are they finding
[2:16:57] that I'm doing?
[2:17:06] Am I talking about all the air and all
[2:17:09] the attitudes and
[2:17:13] of all the brothers that don't see
[2:17:15] things the
[2:17:17] way I do?
[2:17:20] Am I always
[2:17:22] negative?
[2:17:30] Am I complaining? Am I unhappy?
[2:17:37] Or is the joy of the Lord
[2:17:40] bubbling in my soul?
[2:17:43] Cuz I believe that any day now
[2:17:49] the sky may open
[2:17:56] and there he'll be. and
[2:18:00] I'll be caught up
[2:18:04] and the dead in Christ will rise and
[2:18:07] they'll rise with the same anticipation
[2:18:09] I have and expectation
[2:18:13] for his coming. It'll be fresh, the
[2:18:16] prophet of God said on them.
[2:18:19] It'll be a fresh and alive on them
[2:18:22] because that's what they live for.
[2:18:24] That's what they worked for.
[2:18:28] And Lord, this world is
[2:18:31] trying to strangle us.
[2:18:35] And Lord, I ask for a revival in my
[2:18:37] heart.
[2:18:40] That we could turn our focus upon what's
[2:18:43] the most important thing in finding that
[2:18:45] lost soul,
[2:18:48] getting as many in as we can.
[2:18:53] I know father the more people the more
[2:18:55] problems but lord the more problems the
[2:18:57] more life and power that is there to
[2:19:01] handle it there's nothing you can't
[2:19:04] handle Lord Jesus
[2:19:07] may we come together in the unity
[2:19:11] of outreach
[2:19:13] restoration
[2:19:15] and revival
[2:19:17] that's my heart's desire this morning
[2:19:22] that we take sides, Father.
[2:19:25] And I hope that each heart, maybe they
[2:19:27] raised their hand, maybe they didn't,
[2:19:31] but at least we'd examine ourselves and
[2:19:34] we'd say in our heart, "What could I do
[2:19:37] to further the kingdom of God?"
[2:19:42] Lead us, Father.
[2:19:45] May we see you go before us in the
[2:19:47] malberry bush in the rustling of the
[2:19:49] leaves.
[2:19:50] And may we step out in the leadership of
[2:19:53] your spirit,
[2:19:55] Father, carrying out the great
[2:19:58] commission.
[2:19:59] For the church was built on one con
[2:20:02] commission. Go into all the world and
[2:20:06] preach the gospel.
[2:20:08] Then these signs will follow. We've got
[2:20:12] the signs in front of the
[2:20:17] the preaching of it.
[2:20:21] We're trying to have the signs without
[2:20:23] going out into the world. Father, your
[2:20:26] prophet of God said that he wanted to
[2:20:28] put the church back in order. The spirit
[2:20:31] didn't fall until they had all those
[2:20:34] things in order.
[2:20:36] And father, I believe with all my heart
[2:20:39] if we get our outreach, our purpose, our
[2:20:42] lives in the right direction that your
[2:20:45] spirit will fall in a way that there
[2:20:47] will be no confusion. It'll be you and
[2:20:51] we'll see more testimonies like brother
[2:20:54] Paul's testimony because there will be
[2:20:56] more people doing the same work. Uh,
[2:21:00] Father,
[2:21:02] I'm the most guilty of all that are
[2:21:04] here.
[2:21:06] I need the revival more than anyone. If
[2:21:10] this message is to nobody but me this
[2:21:12] morning, Father, please let it take
[2:21:15] root. I ask that you'd be mighty and
[2:21:19] merciful and grateful in Jesus precious
[2:21:22] and holy name we pray.
[2:21:28] Oh, I to Jesus.
[2:21:33] I
[2:21:34] surrender
[2:21:37] all
[2:21:39] to him. I freely
[2:21:43] give.
[2:21:45] I
[2:21:47] will ever
[2:21:49] love
[2:21:54] in
[2:21:55] his presence
[2:21:58] daily
[2:21:59] live.
[2:22:02] I
[2:22:03] surrender.
[2:22:06] Oh Lord, it's not easy.
[2:22:10] I
[2:22:12] surrender
[2:22:14] all
[2:22:20] to thee my
[2:22:24] savior
[2:22:27] I
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; let's sing the next one
[2:22:32] [Music]
[2:22:36] to Jesus
[2:22:39] I surrender
[2:22:45] [Music]
[2:22:48] my
[2:22:51] world
[2:22:57] for shaking
[2:23:02] Jesus
[2:23:03] [Music]
[2:23:06] now.
[2:23:08] I surrender
[2:23:12] all.
[2:23:14] [Music]
[2:23:16] I
[2:23:18] surrender
[2:23:20] all
[2:23:24] [Music]
[2:23:26] to thee my blessed
[2:23:31] Savior
[2:23:33] Christ.
[2:23:36] Let's sing that last verse with me if
[2:23:39] you would.
[2:23:40] [Music]
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you feel that sacred flame?
[2:24:00] Glor.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:24:06] [Music]
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; Glory
[2:24:10] to his praise.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; I
[2:24:16] surrender
[2:24:18] all.
[2:24:22] I
[2:24:24] surrender
[2:24:26] all.
[2:24:29] [Music]
[2:24:31] All to thee my
[2:24:37] savior
[2:24:39] I surrender.
[2:24:43] [Music]
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:46] you know, one time visiting with brother
[2:24:51] Neville,
[2:24:52] you know, I was a young man just coming
[2:24:56] to the message and brother Neville was
[2:24:59] walking. They just started playing tapes
[2:25:02] uh at the tabernacle.
[2:25:05] Brother Neville,
[2:25:08] you know, he
[2:25:11] took me by the hand. He said, you know,
[2:25:14] he said, Brother Bram told me, he says,
[2:25:16] when you say you're sorry, he says, 90%
[2:25:19] of it's all over them. That's right.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; You know, in other words, God takes care
[2:25:25] of the rest.
[2:25:29] If you've made a mess,
[2:25:32] don't worry about it. God's fixed many a
[2:25:35] messes.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; He'll take care of it. And so if you
[2:25:39] repurpose your heart,
[2:25:42] if you've repurposed your heart, then
[2:25:45] 90% of it's already taken care of.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; You don't have to go back. We leave
[2:25:52] those things which are behind behind and
[2:25:54] we press for a higher calling. And I
[2:25:58] just feel that
[2:26:01] this is the better way for us to go
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; as our father's business.
[2:26:08] Don't you? I hope you're with me on it.
[2:26:12] I hope that you could listen to this
[2:26:14] tape and and see the burden of brother
[2:26:17] Random's heart and the things that he
[2:26:19] said. And and that's all I can say. But
[2:26:24] I can tell you one thing. I've never
[2:26:26] been sorry that I've chose this message.
[2:26:30] Anybody sorry about this?
[2:26:33] Huh? Uh-uh. I I couldn't say this. I'll
[2:26:37] tell you,
[2:26:39] I don't even know if I'd be alive if I
[2:26:41] didn't
[2:26:43] hear this word. I mean, I was on crazy
[2:26:46] path,
[2:26:48] you know, and but he just come by and
[2:26:52] and I've never been sorry. We're going
[2:26:54] to sing this. This is our dismissal
[2:26:55] song. You're free to go in peace.
[2:26:59] Ever since Jesus saved and pardoned,
[2:27:02] I've been singing every day. I've never
[2:27:06] been sorry,
[2:27:08] but I trusted his name.
[2:27:10] [Music]
[2:27:12] Oh, the dark is with me fighting the
[2:27:16] upward way. I've never been sorry.
[2:27:21] and I trusted his name.
[2:27:24] I've never been sorry.
[2:27:28] [Music]
[2:27:38] [Applause]
[2:27:40] [Music]
[2:27:46] I trusted his name.
[2:27:50] All day long I sing the story of praise
[2:27:53] for his wonderful love. I've never been
[2:27:56] sorry
[2:27:58] that I trusted his name.
[2:28:02] Surely I know a home is waiting for in
[2:28:07] heaven. I've never been sorry
[2:28:11] that I trust it is made.
[2:28:14] I've never been sorry.
[2:28:21] Every moment I find him
[2:28:24] exactly the same.
[2:28:27] My soul's been singing.
[2:28:32] [Music]
[2:28:33] I've never been sorry,
[2:28:36] but I trusted his name.
[2:28:40] I'm a star of hope is shining through
[2:28:45] bright and low in sorry
[2:28:50] his name
[2:28:51] [Music]
[2:28:56] Jesus with me this I know I've never
[2:28:59] been sorry
[2:29:02] his name
[2:29:07] hallelujah Yeah.
