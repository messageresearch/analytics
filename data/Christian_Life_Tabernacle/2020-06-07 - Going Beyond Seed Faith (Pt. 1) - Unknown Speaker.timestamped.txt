[1:14:05] brother's wife Lord we just know father
[1:14:14] that he loved her they were childhood
[1:14:20] sweethearts Laurie spent their life
[1:14:25] together raised their family or but it
[1:14:30] was her crossing over or we'd live with
[1:14:36] the great hope in our heart that we
[1:14:38] shall meet again and that there's a land
[1:14:42] beyond the river that we want to strive
[1:14:46] for and Lord we don't want to go alone
[1:14:49] we want to take as many of God's
[1:14:51] children with us as we can we ask you to
[1:14:55] bless us and help us this morning
[1:14:57] grab that peace and joy we ask these
[1:15:01] things in Jesus name we pray amen amen
[1:15:07] amen you may be seated
[1:15:12] let's sing that we're going to have a
[1:15:14] baby dedication this morning brother
[1:15:17] George's and then Corvettes are going to
[1:15:21] dedicate their daughter Sharon Rose I'm
[1:15:26] going to try to say this right Maibaum
[1:15:29] boy I don't think I pronounced it just
[1:15:32] right I have an Irish tongue and I just
[1:15:35] don't have that French down yes yeah
[1:15:37] brother George are you here somewhere
[1:15:41] let's sing bring them in they would come
[1:15:44] and
[1:15:45] we would ask the baby dedication this
[1:15:48] morning for their child here they come
[1:15:54] god bless you let's say bring them here
[1:15:56] Oh
[1:15:58] [Music]
[1:16:26] hey sister I can't hold them but brother
[1:16:34] George's you hold your baby up to show
[1:16:37] the people how beautiful it is turn
[1:16:41] around this way so Vegas darling
[1:16:47] hallelujah amen amen
[1:16:52] we don't baptize babies we dedicate them
[1:16:57] and then when the Lord Jesus comes down
[1:17:01] in life somewhere in their path and he
[1:17:06] begins to deal with their heart and then
[1:17:10] that's when they're called
[1:17:11] to repentance and then when they come to
[1:17:15] repentance then they're baptized in the
[1:17:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ so it's a
[1:17:21] choice that she makes so we're gonna
[1:17:24] dedicate her to the Lord and ask her to
[1:17:26] guide her and keep her and bring her to
[1:17:29] that place that she surrenders her life
[1:17:32] to him and and and that's what we
[1:17:35] believe and by faith that work on a
[1:17:38] razor in the way that she should go so
[1:17:42] that when the time comes she'll return
[1:17:44] to that way and they say amen so brother
[1:17:49] George would you say a prayer for your
[1:17:51] daughter and every father knew Jesus we
[1:17:56] thank you for this moment such blessing
[1:18:00] too brought to you my daughter thank you
[1:18:05] Lord to added one more in the family and
[1:18:08] we bring back her life to you
[1:18:11] bless your life Lord let your peace and
[1:18:15] your power gather her life in Jesus
[1:18:20] Christ and pray amen
[1:18:22] I remember when George was just a single
[1:18:26] fella
[1:18:26] running around and now look at this
[1:18:29] beautiful family God's given them a we
[1:18:32] just don't dedicate babies we did a Cape

[1:18:55] angels around her that you keep her and
[1:18:59] guide her that you raise her up in your
[1:19:03] ways in your statutes in your spirit nor
[1:19:08] that the seed that you planted within
[1:19:10] her heart before the foundation of the
[1:19:12] world that you'll water it and increase
[1:19:16] it and bless it and father may she come
[1:19:20] to that place in her life where she
[1:19:22] surrenders her heart 100% to you father

[1:19:29] we ask that you would grant that to this
[1:19:35] wonderful child to this beautiful family
[1:19:38] Lord as they walk in your word we ask
[1:19:42] that you bless them may they prosper and
[1:19:45] be in good health and we dedicate Sharon

[1:19:50] precious and beautiful name of our Lord

[1:20:00] you Betty hey man thank you musicians
[1:20:02] this morning you love the Lord this
[1:20:05] morning amen God certainly good to us
[1:20:11] and and we're sure traveling down a
[1:20:15] wonderful road it's the people are
[1:20:18] slowly be able to make their way back to
[1:20:21] church and in the people are starting to
[1:20:24] go out again and we're starting to
[1:20:28] realize that there's life and life to be
[1:20:32] led and and we certainly
[1:20:36] want to let the joy of our heart reign
[1:20:39] forth we certainly don't want to ever be
[1:20:42] bound by fear amen I certainly enjoyed a
[1:20:48] sister Sandra's testimony I was a
[1:20:52] personal witness to the great power and
[1:20:55] deliverance of the Holy Spirit so we're
[1:20:58] grateful for that you might understand a
[1:21:02] little bit why I try to pace myself and
[1:21:05] I speak a little slower and you can
[1:21:08] understand that we have interpretation
[1:21:10] going on in three different languages
[1:21:14] this morning Spanish and and French and
[1:21:17] Swahili so I think it's wonderful and
[1:21:21] some of those languages take a lot more
[1:21:25] words than the words that we is and and
[1:21:32] also I'm not a very easy person to
[1:21:37] interpret because in order to interpret
[1:21:39] you have to have the thought of what is
[1:21:45] being said and I kind of speak in a
[1:21:49] manner that you don't know where I'm
[1:21:50] going and then I I tell you what I meant
[1:21:53] what I said so I know it's hard but
[1:21:58] there's really something burning in my
[1:22:00] heart and I don't know always how to
[1:22:05] express it but what happens is as I the
[1:22:11] things just comes on my heart and I've
[1:22:14] always been the type of person anybody
[1:22:17] that's really known me they know that
[1:22:20] I'm I'm prone to be a workaholic I'm
[1:22:24] prone to be overboard I guess and maybe
[1:22:29] fanatical in everything that I undertake
[1:22:34] you know I used to deep-sea fish and so
[1:22:39] it wasn't just good enough to go out and
[1:22:42] deep-sea fish for an afternoon or a day
[1:22:45] you know I would take 10-day trips way
[1:22:49] out in the middle of
[1:22:50] the ocean you know what I mean and I
[1:22:52] just didn't have one fishing rod or two
[1:22:55] fishing rods
[1:22:56] I had a fishing rod for every kind of
[1:22:58] fish every size of fish morning rod
[1:23:03] afternoon rod the evening rod and and I
[1:23:07] like to put everything I've got into
[1:23:09] something I don't like to do things
[1:23:13] halfway
[1:23:16] sometimes you're challenged where you
[1:23:20] can't do things the way that you want to
[1:23:22] and you realize that you need the help
[1:23:25] of other people to to go forward
[1:23:30] and so I shared with you a little bit I
[1:23:34] believe it was Sunday evening of the
[1:23:36] path that I feel in my heart nothing
[1:23:41] it's the only path and I'm not saying
[1:23:44] it's the path that you have to take I'm
[1:23:52] just saying in my heart I get just
[1:23:55] something that's burning in my heart
[1:23:57] that I feel that the church needs to
[1:24:00] take into deep consideration and I was
[1:24:07] listening and I came across this sermon
[1:24:10] it's called why Christ beat now there's
[1:24:15] two messages called why Christ beat one
[1:24:18] is in 1963 and we're gonna read some
[1:24:22] portions of that this morning this
[1:24:24] morning's going to be a Bible study
[1:24:26] we're not going to try to be too long
[1:24:28] but maybe it'll be a little longer this
[1:24:31] morning but I hope that you can take it
[1:24:34] in your heart but I'd like to play for
[1:24:37] you a portion of a sermon of called why
[1:24:43] Christ be preached in 1959 and the both
[1:24:49] of the sermons are very parallel and
[1:24:52] they're dealing with the same subject
[1:24:58] matter in a lot of ways but you can see
[1:25:02] from where brother
[1:25:03] random brought it up and how that it
[1:25:05] comes up and the progression of the
[1:25:08] church so I'd like to listen to this
[1:25:13] this morning and a lot of times in this
[1:25:19] message why Christ beat brother
[1:25:22] branham's referring to that because of
[1:25:27] the talking about Moses and what Moses
[1:25:34] went through but this morning when you
[1:25:37] listen to this I would like you to
[1:25:42] realize that Moses is a type of you and
[1:25:47] you say well Moses was a type of Christ
[1:25:50] yes he was a type of Christ and and so
[1:25:55] we see that that the the if Moses was a
[1:26:01] type of Christ and the things that
[1:26:03] transpired in Moses life reflected what
[1:26:06] was in Christ life well if we follow
[1:26:09] that same pattern down we know that what
[1:26:12] we saw in Christ's life in the lord
[1:26:14] jesus' life should be reflected in our
[1:26:18] life that that's what we we would be
[1:26:22] able to look at and see because our
[1:26:25] whole goal is is to become like he was
[1:26:28] that the works that i do you shall do
[1:26:32] all so our goal our purpose our heart is
[1:26:37] to be come and to enter into this union
[1:26:42] that that we have with the lord jesus
[1:26:46] christ and that that union might
[1:26:49] manifest in our lives that the that the
[1:26:56] truth of god's word might be reflected
[1:27:01] through us and so when you listen to
[1:27:04] this o berm and subtitles that the
[1:27:10] attitude towards god's anointed and buts
[1:27:17] since this morning were God's anointed
[1:27:22] and I like just my thought from this is
[1:27:26] not the anointing towards God's attitude
[1:27:30] toward God's anointing but the attitude
[1:27:34] towards our anointing in other words
[1:27:37] were God's anointed one what's the
[1:27:40] attitude that we have towards the
[1:27:44] anointing that God has placed upon us
[1:27:48] the calling that he's placed upon us the
[1:27:52] election that he has given us the the
[1:27:56] power that he is a poured upon us what
[1:27:59] is our attitude towards it and before I
[1:28:03] get caught up and start going let's just
[1:28:05] take them moment for 27 minutes that's
[1:28:08] not too long my personal belief you're
[1:28:12] gonna listen to 27 minutes of the
[1:28:16] greatest preacher that has ever walked
[1:28:23] since the days of the Lord and in the
[1:28:26] days of Paul and one that had the true
[1:28:32] Word of God and I just think it'll bless
[1:28:35] you this morning so if you would
[1:28:38] patiently listen and and and it just
[1:28:43] take these few moments and then I'll try
[1:28:46] not to be too long afterwards and then
[1:28:49] we'll just keep moving forward
[1:28:51] tonight is communion in foot-washing I
[1:28:54] just decided I don't have to preach the
[1:28:56] whole sermon and one morning so I'll
[1:28:59] preach it in little parts but so this
[1:29:03] let's listen this morning as we listen
[1:29:10] to what the prophet of God saying about
[1:29:12] a church that goes forward so if the
[1:29:16] brothers would play it and we'll just
[1:29:20] ask the Lord to richly bless you this
[1:29:25] morning
[1:29:25] so as we were going to start
[1:29:31] we can go ahead and and stand and if you
[1:29:35] want like to open your Bibles go ahead
[1:29:37] let's stand and we'll open our Bibles to
[1:29:40] Exodus the fourteenth chapter and and
[1:29:45] when brother Branham reads these words
[1:29:51] when he says may the Lord add his
[1:29:54] blessings to the reading of the word and
[1:29:57] then he'll say a prayer and at the end
[1:30:00] of his prayer just be seated lord richly
[1:30:04] bless you this morning that I hope that
[1:30:06] you have confidence in the Word of God
[1:30:08] this morning and that you're interested
[1:30:11] in knowing what God wants us to be God
[1:30:14] richly bless you this morning I wish to
[1:30:23] read now out of the book of Exodus the
[1:30:26] fourteenth chapter and the fifteenth
[1:30:30] verse and the Lord said unto Moses were
[1:30:38] for Christ island to me speak to the
[1:30:42] children of Israel that they go forward
[1:30:46] may I read the sixteenth also but lift
[1:30:51] up thy rod stretch out thine hand over
[1:30:56] the sea and divided and the children of
[1:30:59] Israel shall pass on dry ground through
[1:31:02] the midst of the sea may the Lord at his
[1:31:06] blessings to the reading of his word and
[1:31:09] now let us bow our heads just a moment
[1:31:12] for prayer and if there's any people
[1:31:17] share that would like to be remembered
[1:31:19] in this prayer may you let it be known
[1:31:22] to God by an uplifted hand the Lord
[1:31:27] grant to you your desire Lord we now
[1:31:31] solemnly and honorably and childlike
[1:31:36] walk on the
[1:31:38] sacred grounds of Prayer we lay aside
[1:31:44] every weight every sin every thought
[1:31:47] that does so easily beset us that we
[1:31:51] might run with patience the race that
[1:31:53] set before us and as we move into these
[1:31:57] blessed sacred sands of Prayer knowing
[1:32:03] this that Jesus said ask the Father
[1:32:07] anything in my name I'll do it and again
[1:32:12] it is written if ye abide in me and my
[1:32:16] word in you ask what you will and it
[1:32:19] shall be done unto you
[1:32:22] then we come Lord not in the name of
[1:32:27] this little church or in the name of its
[1:32:30] pastor though we love them are not in
[1:32:34] our own name because we have nothing to
[1:32:38] offer through it but we come in that all
[1:32:41] sufficient name of the Lord Jesus who
[1:32:46] gave us a promise that if we asked in
[1:32:50] his name we could receive whatever we
[1:32:52] asked and we would not want to ask
[1:32:56] anything that was a myth we would want
[1:33:00] to ask only that which would be pleasing
[1:33:04] to you you know our conditions you know
[1:33:11] what we have need of you know what this
[1:33:13] little church has need of and what each
[1:33:16] individual has need ah we'd pray the
[1:33:19] Lord God to give to us save early as we
[1:33:22] have needs may the great holy spirit
[1:33:26] move down upon this building and around
[1:33:30] these people and sanctify this group
[1:33:34] that the Holy Spirit might have there
[1:33:36] right away through every heart here
[1:33:38] tonight from the least of the children
[1:33:40] to the oldest Granite Lord these hands
[1:33:45] that were lifted up you most surely seen
[1:33:48] them Lord if a spare
[1:33:51] cannot fall in the street without you
[1:33:53] knowing it how much more do you know
[1:33:56] when a child of yours lifts its hand
[1:33:59] towards heaven for bread we are promised
[1:34:03] that it will not receive a stone instead
[1:34:06] we know that you shall give them the
[1:34:09] bread that they asked for and we would
[1:34:13] ask to remember all that's sick and
[1:34:15] afflicted so glad to hear from brother
[1:34:18] Rogers that he said he felt well enough
[1:34:20] to go to work we are so glad for that
[1:34:24] Lord praying that you will heal him that
[1:34:28] that cancer will not have the the right
[1:34:31] away but will be stopped by the blood of
[1:34:34] the Lord Jesus by faith we place the
[1:34:38] blood of the Lord Jesus between the
[1:34:42] death cancer and our brother now we ask
[1:34:46] for all that's Nydia we're get glory to
[1:34:50] thyself honor thy word Lord as we have
[1:34:52] read it and give us a great healing
[1:34:55] service for the glory of God we asked it
[1:34:58] in the name of the Lord Jesus a man for
[1:35:05] our text tonight I would like to use
[1:35:08] three words why cry speak and for a
[1:35:17] subject I would like to use the attitude
[1:35:20] of people towards God's anointed just
[1:35:24] for a short time perhaps twenty minutes
[1:35:27] or thirty then we'll start the prayer
[1:35:30] line God had called Moses a special
[1:35:37] calling and when God calls the man and
[1:35:42] anoint him for a certain duty he expects
[1:35:47] that man to carry that out to the letter
[1:35:50] God doesn't want to give a man a
[1:35:54] commission in him hum Hall around about
[1:35:57] it he won't seem to go straight forward
[1:36:00] and do just exactly what he's
[1:36:03] commissioned to do
[1:36:04] don't look right or left just move
[1:36:10] forward and the children of Israel had
[1:36:14] been in bondage for some 400 years but
[1:36:18] God had promised that he would visit
[1:36:20] them and God keeps every promise that he
[1:36:25] makes he cannot lie he's God and the
[1:36:32] time had come for this visitation and I
[1:36:39] believe tonight
[1:36:40] paralleling that God made a promise that
[1:36:44] he would return again I believe that we
[1:36:49] are near that time this morning when I
[1:36:54] was speaking on that subject I could
[1:36:58] almost feel the current as the saying
[1:37:03] that the nearness of the Lord Jesus now
[1:37:10] Moses being called for this purpose but
[1:37:14] he was a man God training 80 years
[1:37:18] before he ever was able to use him 40
[1:37:22] years in the palace and 40 years in the
[1:37:24] wilderness God can train a man taking a
[1:37:28] hundred years for 30 minutes worth God
[1:37:34] knows how to train what the schools have
[1:37:40] put in Moses 40 years had taken 40 years
[1:37:43] to get it out but one time in the
[1:37:46] presence of the anointing one time in
[1:37:51] the presence of the burning bush he'd
[1:37:53] know more about God than Hitler 10 bucks
[1:37:56] in the 80 years of his life
[1:38:00] God trains his man than anoints and
[1:38:03] gives an experience takes them to the
[1:38:07] Riggin training down to the sands of
[1:38:10] burning punishment trying testing not
[1:38:15] only does he do that to the
[1:38:17] profits but he does it to his children
[1:38:20] every son that cometh to God must be
[1:38:23] chastened and tried tested by his world
[1:38:28] see when the pitch comes the strong time
[1:38:32] when it faces death are you able to
[1:38:35] stand there on the Word of God say God
[1:38:38] said so that settles it and God it calls
[1:38:44] such a man and that man must Moses but
[1:38:48] Moses are greater like us every time it
[1:38:51] come a place to something had to be done
[1:38:54] Moses called out o Lord what must I do
[1:38:57] in this place now isn't that just like
[1:39:01] we do God had blessed him and anointed
[1:39:06] him above his brethren give him a
[1:39:08] message and a ministry that had not been
[1:39:11] on the earth since that day until that
[1:39:13] day and yet every time something taking
[1:39:18] place Moses run off to God with it Lord
[1:39:21] what must I do what must I do in this
[1:39:24] case God got tired of it I believe said
[1:39:29] why are you crying to me speak to the
[1:39:33] people and go forward to retreat was in
[1:39:39] but God has no retreat there's no place
[1:39:44] to retreat in God go forward the doctor
[1:39:48] says his cancer go forward if he says
[1:39:51] his TV go forward if the devil says you
[1:39:55] can't give this up go forward if your
[1:39:59] home says that you're going to be a
[1:40:00] fanatic go forward the church turns you
[1:40:04] out go forward there's no retreating
[1:40:07] back go forward speak and go forward
[1:40:13] speak while his word I can't go forward
[1:40:16] thus saith the Lord and move on crowd to
[1:40:21] the people but the people then rebelled
[1:40:24] and said it had been better that we died
[1:40:27] down in Egypt
[1:40:29] it'd have been better that we had our
[1:40:31] grave smart than from the hyenas and the
[1:40:34] vultures that picked our bones in this
[1:40:38] wilderness why did you bring us out here
[1:40:42] after that scene that God had approved
[1:40:47] Moses to be his servant God when God
[1:40:51] comes into a person or two persons into
[1:40:56] a congregation into a man or woman he of
[1:40:59] indicates his presence God proves that
[1:41:03] he's there while when God comes
[1:41:06] supernatural signs begin to appear this
[1:41:09] person becomes a changed person they're
[1:41:13] not no more like they used to be sin has
[1:41:16] vanished from their life fear and doubt
[1:41:18] has vanished frustrations their solid
[1:41:22] stable leave our dies Christ don't care
[1:41:28] what comes or what goes nothing shakes
[1:41:30] them they move forward
[1:41:32] and Moses Freddy with the people and
[1:41:36] other people threaded to Moses and he
[1:41:38] said what must we do and go farmer
[1:41:43] bicycle answer now they said we are out
[1:41:47] in this wilderness and the armies of
[1:41:49] Pharaoh is approaching us they're camped
[1:41:52] just behind us but Moses knew to obey
[1:41:56] God and if God sends a representative
[1:42:01] and he anoints this representative and
[1:42:04] sends it into the world the people must
[1:42:07] obey that representative it's always
[1:42:10] been that way all down through the Bible
[1:42:14] Moses is called for the job God has said
[1:42:17] in the word he would do it he promised
[1:42:20] that he would send such a thing in that
[1:42:24] day to deliver him and God did his part
[1:42:28] Saint Moses and the children of Israel
[1:42:30] just because little stumbles and things
[1:42:33] come along to try they failed to march
[1:42:37] with Moses
[1:42:39] I isn't that just like today we see the
[1:42:44] message come forth we see the church
[1:42:47] rise to a place on the wings of the Holy
[1:42:49] Spirit until the power of God trills
[1:42:53] every person in there the glory of God
[1:42:57] Falls around in signs and wonders take
[1:42:59] place less than a week
[1:43:01] Satan is permitted to come into that
[1:43:03] congregation why does he do it God
[1:43:07] permits it and then the church begins to
[1:43:11] murmur fall back maybe it wasn't so
[1:43:14] there's where we fail
[1:43:17] that's the failing of the church
[1:43:20] regardless of what takes place it's God
[1:43:23] move forward or say there's brother
[1:43:26] so-and-so I shouted the victory with him
[1:43:28] but he's back no matter what he done
[1:43:31] that has nothing to do with you well
[1:43:36] so-and-so professor said that that
[1:43:38] wasn't right that wasn't other the Lord
[1:43:41] no matter what professor said so you are
[1:43:43] the God who stood on the sacred grounds
[1:43:46] you're the guy was at the burning bush
[1:43:50] professors of Egypt what a pharaoh would
[1:43:53] have said to Moses oh you just imagined
[1:43:55] you seen a bush you thought you had a
[1:43:57] that's reward in your ears Moses do you
[1:44:04] want to talk to him and every man thus
[1:44:06] born of the Spirit of God knows what
[1:44:08] talks to him when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:44:10] it speaks a peace that passes
[1:44:13] understanding
[1:44:15] Moses was called he and God then edge of
[1:44:19] Moses receiving his call he went down to
[1:44:22] Egypt then he's got to get the people to
[1:44:24] believe him now he was the anointed
[1:44:27] prophet of the Lord but the people
[1:44:30] didn't believe him though he God proved
[1:44:33] it by signs and wonders that he did and
[1:44:37] because they didn't believe Moses the
[1:44:41] servant of the Lord then they fell in
[1:44:44] the wilderness and every one of them
[1:44:46] died that left Egypt
[1:44:48] not a one of them was saved everyone
[1:44:52] died and perished beside Joshua and
[1:44:54] Caleb that started out because they
[1:44:58] murmured and complained against the
[1:45:01] vindicated message that God has spoken
[1:45:04] the Bible
[1:45:05] oh when I think of that when God
[1:45:12] promises anything God keeps his word
[1:45:16] and when God confirms that word to you
[1:45:18] then believe it God promised in the last
[1:45:22] days he had pour out his spirit upon all
[1:45:26] flesh and your young men would see
[1:45:29] visions the old man would dream dreams
[1:45:31] if all my hands made some maidservant
[1:45:33] well I'll pour out of my spirit he's
[1:45:36] sure signs in the heavens and in the
[1:45:38] earth and great signs and wonders would
[1:45:41] take place in the last days and here we
[1:45:44] are in the last days and God's keeping
[1:45:46] his word the Holy Spirit's here and it
[1:45:51] indicates the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:45:53] and the people turn it down and murmur
[1:45:57] against them just like it was that's our
[1:46:00] deliverance Moses was a signpost of the
[1:46:07] deliverance of Israel according to God's
[1:46:10] Word the time through 9 God sent Moses
[1:46:14] he was God's light for that day I am
[1:46:17] today
[1:46:18] the time is drawing nigh atomic bombs
[1:46:21] are ready the world's going to be blown
[1:46:23] to pieces
[1:46:24] pretty soon ashes all over the earth
[1:46:26] nothing Falk indication the time is at
[1:46:29] hand and God promised he'd pour out his
[1:46:32] spirit and take his church out and the
[1:46:34] Holy Ghost is here representing that
[1:46:36] with signs and wonders proving that he
[1:46:39] is the same Jesus Christ in the form of
[1:46:42] the Holy Ghost
[1:46:42] doing the same work that he did when he
[1:46:44] was your honor lines of people the
[1:46:49] gospel always blinds the people if they
[1:46:52] don't open their eyes you either walk or
[1:46:55] it blinds the people yes
[1:46:58] every case in the Bible when God sent a
[1:47:01] messenger and that messenger was
[1:47:03] received there was a revival in that
[1:47:06] time but if they was not received there
[1:47:09] was no revival but just chaos followed
[1:47:12] the unbelief
[1:47:13] so is it today nothing less I think
[1:47:17] today I like to make mention of one
[1:47:20] woman and I think of in the Bible and
[1:47:22] she was bad to begin with rotten to the
[1:47:27] core
[1:47:28] a young beautiful woman by the name of
[1:47:30] Rahab
[1:47:32] she was a heathen to start with and she
[1:47:36] was a prostitute on the street but she
[1:47:42] heard that there was a God not an idol
[1:47:47] that said to her her declaration of
[1:47:49] Crete but God who lived among his people
[1:47:53] and anointed them and signs and wonders
[1:47:56] was falling there she heard about it one
[1:48:01] day two representatives come to Jericho
[1:48:04] and quickly her on the street as a
[1:48:07] prostitute she called him took him into
[1:48:10] her house said they're after you and she
[1:48:13] hid them I have like her attitude she
[1:48:17] never said I'll believe when I see the
[1:48:22] great anointed Joshua do some sign if I
[1:48:26] could have seen Moses do some of the
[1:48:29] signs I would have believed but she said
[1:48:32] I have heard faith cometh by hearing
[1:48:37] hearing of the word I have heard that
[1:48:43] the God of heaven who is a real God is
[1:48:47] with you and he doesn't great signs and
[1:48:52] wonders he dried up the Red Sea he
[1:48:55] brought bags up on Egypt we see how you
[1:48:58] turned the enemy over to your hands and
[1:49:00] our whole country is trembling because
[1:49:03] of it I'm asking mercy
[1:49:07] she didn't say I'll have to see this God
[1:49:10] first let me take my judgement take my
[1:49:13] my scripture says about that and see she
[1:49:15] never found it but faith cometh by
[1:49:18] hearing hearing the Word of God and she
[1:49:23] believed and when these words was
[1:49:26] brought back to Joshua the word Joshua
[1:49:29] means Savior like Jesus that and it
[1:49:32] brought back to Joshua God's anointed
[1:49:34] her house was permitted to stand and
[1:49:38] when the people marched 13 times around
[1:49:40] the walls of Jericho and sounded the
[1:49:43] trumpet every place on that wall fell at
[1:49:47] her house because she believed before
[1:49:51] she seen anything she accepted it she
[1:49:55] said they're servants of the Most High
[1:49:58] God and I was receiving up on the basis
[1:50:02] of hearing it I believe it faith cometh
[1:50:06] by hearing she heard it she believed she
[1:50:10] accepted it I noticed they said buying
[1:50:14] this scarlet string that you led us down
[1:50:17] with find it in the window that reg
[1:50:20] spoke of the blood of Jesus their Tolman
[1:50:23] and every place in that wall fell but
[1:50:27] Rahab's house it said on top of the wall
[1:50:30] God honored her and he she saw as great
[1:50:34] a miracle performed there as he was
[1:50:37] drying up the red sea where the hand of
[1:50:40] Jehovah was over that little place to
[1:50:42] protect it she had accepted it God's
[1:50:47] anointed God's servants went over there
[1:50:50] anointed and she believed it before
[1:50:53] she's seen miracles she believed it
[1:50:55] anyhow and accepted it
[1:50:57] they larger the prophet of the Lord
[1:51:02] anointed oh yes God anointed him to be
[1:51:06] prophet he was pastor Elisha I don't
[1:51:10] imagine Jezebel would have wanted
[1:51:12] calling that but he was her pastor just
[1:51:15] the same
[1:51:17] God made her pastor
[1:51:21] so she hated him and God told him said
[1:51:25] you go up on the mountain and you sit
[1:51:27] down there I've commanded the crows to
[1:51:30] fiji i'll water you from the brook Sidra
[1:51:33] and he set down there and the king said
[1:51:38] go get that fanatic and bring him down
[1:51:40] here and the soldiers all armed with the
[1:51:44] command of the king they start up the
[1:51:47] hill and elijah probably raised up and
[1:51:49] said something like this gentlemen this
[1:51:52] is a holy spot I've been called of God
[1:51:56] to be his prophet stand on these grounds
[1:52:02] and proclaim his message and the message
[1:52:06] that I have for you don't you approach
[1:52:07] this ground stay off of here or the
[1:52:13] uncircumcised have you not read when
[1:52:16] Moses the servant of the Lord crossed
[1:52:19] over the river and the uncircumcised
[1:52:22] tried to impersonate him they all
[1:52:24] drowned stay off of this ground what
[1:52:30] schools he from we'll go in anyhow
[1:52:33] Elisha said if I'd be a man of God that
[1:52:37] fire fall from heaven and vindicate my
[1:52:40] ministry and about that time fire
[1:52:42] felling burn up 50 the King might have
[1:52:47] said lightning struck him so he sent
[1:52:49] another 15 the same thing happened
[1:52:52] unbelief man who Malkin scoffing make
[1:52:57] fun of the United Church of the Living
[1:52:59] God Shall Perish someday and I hell
[1:53:03] won't only be burning for a few minutes
[1:53:06] it might be a long time so it's holy
[1:53:11] ground God's anointed stands on there no
[1:53:16] uncircumcised or unclean thing can enter
[1:53:19] that spot that is true if impersonators
[1:53:24] try to act like it they're doing it
[1:53:26] you'll find out they'll soon come to
[1:53:29] naught
[1:53:30] but what does the impersonators
[1:53:32] vindicate that there is a real there's a
[1:53:36] real God there are some people who won't
[1:53:38] say they don't believe it but they won't
[1:53:40] act like they believe it but a person
[1:53:42] that knows God is a man that's born
[1:53:45] again of the Holy Ghost and filled with
[1:53:48] the power of God with a thus saith the
[1:53:50] Lord he goes forward they know something
[1:53:53] has struck their heart they know that
[1:53:55] they're hanging so Elijah was a man of
[1:53:59] God anointed that they did not believe
[1:54:02] look at David when he set with Nathan
[1:54:05] the Prophet David a manager God's own
[1:54:08] heart and he was in arted God anointed
[1:54:12] him King David is not only a king but he
[1:54:15] was a prophet so Nathan was a great
[1:54:19] prophet of the nation
[1:54:21] David is more or less a point and a
[1:54:23] prophet songwriter musician and prophesy
[1:54:28] really in its original is more like a a
[1:54:32] song when they prophesy then one day
[1:54:38] while the prophet and the King was
[1:54:40] sitting together David said it's not
[1:54:42] right for me to live in a house of cedar
[1:54:45] in the Ark of my god under attempt I
[1:54:49] don't want you to listen the notable
[1:54:52] words of Nathan he said David oh don't
[1:54:57] be able to get this I get between the
[1:54:59] lines David do all that's in your heart
[1:55:03] for God is with you when I think of that
[1:55:10] David do all that's in your heart for
[1:55:13] God's with you why cry out to me
[1:55:16] God's with you speak and go forward
[1:55:20] God's anointed you move on don't him a
[1:55:24] Hall around say this that or the other
[1:55:26] should I believe God should I trust him
[1:55:28] for this trust him for every breath that
[1:55:29] you draw it was a great general
[1:55:33] Stonewall Jackson who's been my favorite
[1:55:37] general since Joshua
[1:55:39] Stonewall Jackson was asked one time how
[1:55:42] can you stand with just a handful of man
[1:55:47] when the opposition is so great
[1:55:50] that's how I got his name of Stonewall
[1:55:52] he would not budge he'd no no retreat
[1:55:58] what could we accredit a man like that
[1:56:00] to a man when the Yankees come down by
[1:56:05] the thousands and he stood there in the
[1:56:06] minority but they'd never move him he
[1:56:10] stood like a stone wall all the rest of
[1:56:12] the rebel army had retreated back Lyons
[1:56:15] come along said what's the matter with
[1:56:16] Jackson why isn't he going he said he
[1:56:19] stands like a stone wall the other
[1:56:25] generals asked he said mr. Jackson a
[1:56:27] little-bitty fellow black-headed and
[1:56:29] blue-eyed always about five foot two
[1:56:31] inches tall very modest Myles speaking
[1:56:34] little fella said mr. Jackson how can
[1:56:37] you stand in such opposition master like
[1:56:41] he kicked his boot on the ground he said
[1:56:43] I never take a drink of water unless I
[1:56:46] thank God for it first that's where it
[1:56:49] is there's no retreat than God speak and
[1:56:53] go forward
[1:56:54] it's right that's God's Commission to
[1:56:57] his church we have no time to slack they
[1:57:00] say the revival is over it isn't over
[1:57:04] it's time that Pentecost is played out
[1:57:07] it isn't it's time for Pentecost to rise
[1:57:10] in the name of Jesus Christ then go
[1:57:12] forward there's no retreat
[1:57:14] there's no stain on the same ground
[1:57:16] let's move with the spirit or the spirit
[1:57:19] we'll move on to somebody else and leave
[1:57:21] you standing you follow it you all
[1:57:24] that's in your heart for God is with you
[1:57:32] amen amen let's all so let's just stand
[1:57:37] a moment and let's just read the
[1:57:38] scripture and then we'll spend a few
[1:57:40] moments let's turn over and our Bibles
[1:57:43] again to loot the 24th chapter and the
[1:57:57] 44th uh verse and he said unto them
[1:58:05] these are the words which I speak unto
[1:58:08] you well I was yet with you that all
[1:58:11] things must be fulfilled
[1:58:14] which were written in the law of Moses
[1:58:17] and in the prophets and in the Psalms
[1:58:21] concerning me then opened he their
[1:58:26] understanding that they might understand
[1:58:29] the scriptures and he said unto them
[1:58:33] thus it is written and thus it behooves
[1:58:38] Christ to suffer and to raise from the
[1:58:43] dead the third day and that repentance
[1:58:48] and remission of sins should be preached
[1:58:52] in his name among all nations beginning
[1:58:57] at Jerusalem and ye are witnesses of
[1:59:01] these things
[1:59:04] behold I will send the promise of my
[1:59:08] father upon you but tarry ye in the city
[1:59:13] of Jerusalem until ye be endued with
[1:59:18] power from on high
[1:59:20] Lord blesses where you may be seated
[1:59:29] as we listened to that portion of the
[1:59:35] message my heart's desire was is that as
[1:59:39] he spoke about Moses he was speaking
[1:59:42] about you and at the end we have such a
[1:59:48] tendency to when we listen to the
[1:59:52] message and that the messenger speaks we
[1:59:58] always take it back to him but but it's
[2:00:03] everything of the Word of God that
[2:00:07] applies the principles of the word of
[2:00:10] God applies to the believer also all
[2:00:14] that God was he poured into Christ all
[2:00:18] that Christ was he poured into the
[2:00:22] church so the principles that follow and
[2:00:27] apply to Moses many are the same
[2:00:30] principles that applied in fall to us he
[2:00:35] says that God called Moses a special
[2:00:37] calling and when God calls a man and
[2:00:41] anoints him for a certain duty yep that
[2:00:45] if you just listen to that you think
[2:00:48] he's talking about Moses and you don't
[2:00:50] make that personal God has called each
[2:00:54] of you we are called we are lected we
[2:01:00] are chosen so that statement when God
[2:01:04] calls a man or a woman that's what he
[2:01:12] said
[2:01:12] now can you put yourself in there the
[2:01:16] prophet of God said put yourself in
[2:01:18] every scripture put your name in there
[2:01:21] put yourself in that place so he's not
[2:01:25] talking that's what I wanted to play
[2:01:27] this this morning so that you would
[2:01:29] listen that this is the voice of God to
[2:01:32] us speaking and so and he's talking
[2:01:36] about the church he says when God called
[2:01:40] Moses a special calling when God called
[2:01:43] a man and anoint him for a certain duty
[2:01:47] he expects that every man to carry that
[2:01:51] out to the letter God doesn't want to
[2:01:55] give a man a commission and have him
[2:01:58] hee-haw around about it we have a
[2:02:02] commission going to all the world and
[2:02:08] preach the gospel baptizing them in the
[2:02:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ lay hands
[2:02:16] on the sick and they shall recover they
[2:02:19] shall take up deadly things and it shall
[2:02:22] not harm them these signs shall follow
[2:02:25] them that believe you see that
[2:02:29] Commission wasn't just given 2,000 years
[2:02:33] ago it was given to the believer it's
[2:02:39] given to the believer so when God calls
[2:02:43] you he doesn't want a man he doesn't
[2:02:47] want a person with this calling the
[2:02:50] whole hung around about it and so that's
[2:02:53] kind of what's burning in my heart is
[2:02:57] that he said that you go up there and
[2:03:01] you wait and you be endued with power
[2:03:03] from on high elephant in dude as we said
[2:03:11] before means that you will be provided
[2:03:16] with you will be given
[2:03:19] uoq you will go up there wait and tarry
[2:03:23] till you have received something from
[2:03:28] the Father that gives you the power to
[2:03:33] perform every promise that's written in
[2:03:38] the Word of God that that would what
[2:03:44] peace he promised
[2:03:48] now I'm sitting here this morning and
[2:03:54] Moses goes on and
[2:03:57] we kind of read some of the statements
[2:03:59] Tibet he said here he says Moses had
[2:04:04] treats about one time in the presence of
[2:04:07] that anointing one time in the presence
[2:04:10] of that burning bush he knowed more
[2:04:12] about God than he'd learned in the books
[2:04:15] in 80 years of life what does he do with
[2:04:21] this province he does with to his
[2:04:24] children's every son that cometh to God
[2:04:27] must be chastened tried and tested in
[2:04:31] his word and God had called such a man
[2:04:36] and man as Moses God but Moses is a
[2:04:42] great deal like us every time it comes
[2:04:45] to a place till something has to be done
[2:04:48] so we're sitting here this morning let's
[2:04:52] just take a moment and look at ourselves
[2:04:58] we're sitting here to Mort this morning
[2:05:02] claiming to be be elected called out
[2:05:08] people of God I believe that okay
[2:05:16] I'm not doubting that two-bit i'm not
[2:05:20] going to browbeat anybody and say if if
[2:05:24] if we are the elected called out Church
[2:05:28] of the Living God
[2:05:30] now we also claim that we have received
[2:05:37] the baptism of the Holy Spirit and if we
[2:05:43] receive that baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:05:46] that's what the scripture said go up and
[2:05:49] Terry and wait and stay there until you
[2:05:58] receive the promise of the Father until
[2:06:05] your endued with power from the most hot
[2:06:10] you stay there till God provides you
[2:06:13] with the power now I believe with all my
[2:06:19] heart Vic that you testify I asked the
[2:06:23] other day how many receive the Holy
[2:06:25] Spirit and the hands went up I've got it
[2:06:31] I meant the Holy Spirit I I've had an
[2:06:38] encounter with that burning bush well
[2:06:46] now to me that means that there's a
[2:06:49] testimony coming out of your mouth that
[2:06:52] says I have received power from the
[2:06:57] father on high to live and perform every
[2:07:04] promise in the book now that puts us
[2:07:10] right on the same ground with Moses is
[2:07:15] that right I got notes here but I'm
[2:07:20] probably not going to be able to use
[2:07:22] them I can't read through it and go
[2:07:25] through it and everything there is a
[2:07:27] couple things I do want to read though
[2:07:30] and and I'll read them but so this
[2:07:35] morning there is enough power in this
[2:07:41] church isn't that true
[2:07:48] there's enough power to take to act upon
[2:07:52] every promised word that's in the Bible
[2:07:58] and we are commissioned by God and
[2:08:03] that's that's where we're this great
[2:08:08] conflict that is is taking place comes
[2:08:15] to pass so now we want to make a
[2:08:18] personal and talk to us this morning and
[2:08:23] just listen this was out a white cry
[2:08:25] speak 63 so now brother man is coming
[2:08:30] back and he's revisiting this the church
[2:08:36] has got to go forward the church has got
[2:08:39] to go forward nothing could stop the
[2:08:43] church if something rises up the church
[2:08:47] goes forward unbelief comes in the
[2:08:53] church goes forward disease comes in the
[2:08:56] church goes forward we go forward I like
[2:09:00] what he said I like Stonewall Jackson a
[2:09:04] man we got a Stonewall Jackson stands
[2:09:10] there and puts him in their seat ellia
[2:09:18] he said play safe it's over go forward
[2:09:24] where is Pentecost that commissions over
[2:09:28] it's not over where is the works they're
[2:09:31] not over hey I like how he P he comes
[2:09:35] and says it he says in the name of Jesus
[2:09:38] Christ he said let's go forward there's
[2:09:42] no retreat
[2:09:43] there's no staying on the same ground
[2:09:46] let's move with the spirit or the spirit
[2:09:49] we'll move on to somebody else and leave
[2:09:52] you standing you follow it do all that's
[2:09:57] in your heart
[2:10:01] God is with you so the question is that
[2:10:08] we've been given we've been given this
[2:10:12] great power you believe it you possess
[2:10:22] it there's a difference between if I
[2:10:26] could say it being made available to you
[2:10:31] and possessing it I kind of look at it
[2:10:38] like a rent-a-car you fly into a place
[2:10:43] there's cars available to you but you
[2:10:50] don't possess it but when you arrive you
[2:10:56] don't have to go get the car you've got
[2:10:59] the car you are the car you possess it
[2:11:04] so the path and this is what eat the
[2:11:07] point was is that every time that
[2:11:12] something came up they would run and say
[2:11:16] oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god
[2:11:23] god you're available to us you're
[2:11:27] available to us you you you've got the
[2:11:30] power to come and do this you've got the
[2:11:34] power to come and do that Oh God come in
[2:11:38] and work Oh God come in and deliver this
[2:11:42] person Oh God come in and do this but
[2:11:50] God wants to go beyond that with us he
[2:11:54] wants to have a greater fellowship than
[2:11:56] that with us he wants to say I have
[2:11:59] given you the power use it see do what's
[2:12:10] in your heart
[2:12:16] you you uh you meet somebody and you you
[2:12:25] you have a burden in your heart form you
[2:12:30] want them to be well you wanna meet D
[2:12:33] delivered and all all things is is is
[2:12:38] the Satan has captivated people he has
[2:12:45] brought them into bondage it's not that
[2:12:48] person
[2:12:49] I think pictures I watched one time some
[2:12:56] going through a very difficult time in
[2:12:59] in life and things and I went and watch
[2:13:03] some before and after pictures and these
[2:13:09] were pictures of young women and young
[2:13:12] men before they started using I believe
[2:13:19] it's like methamphetamines I think it's
[2:13:22] meth or crack or whatever it is and
[2:13:30] watch the effect of that drug and the
[2:13:37] change of their appearance and as I
[2:13:47] watched it in my heart i I didn't look
[2:13:52] no longer look at it as the physical I
[2:13:59] thought spiritually that that the
[2:14:06] wickedness of that disease and that
[2:14:12] demon honor those people and my heart
[2:14:18] went out we take alcohol
[2:14:26] I noticed in our country and and you
[2:14:32] know we shut down our churches but we
[2:14:34] kept our liquor stores open because that
[2:14:38] was a necessity for for so many people
[2:14:46] and it's not those people you understand
[2:14:52] today it's the power and people that
[2:14:58] fall into those places like my brother
[2:15:03] and different people and families
[2:15:06] members that's been a big problem in in
[2:15:09] in my family Irish family my family's
[2:15:14] full of alcoholics but they're it's not
[2:15:19] them you are said there's a power that
[2:15:24] is over them it's the power that is over
[2:15:35] them that has control of them and now
[2:15:40] sitting in the same place is a people
[2:15:46] with the power that's greater then that
[2:15:50] power he who is in you is greater than
[2:15:57] he'll is in the world York of people
[2:16:03] that possess of power you're elected
[2:16:09] you're chosen
[2:16:10] you're called now there's got to be
[2:16:18] something we would look at this power
[2:16:21] and you would say if I gave you
[2:16:24] something and I brought you something
[2:16:29] and I gave you something and I placed it
[2:16:33] in your hand and all of a sudden you
[2:16:39] have this
[2:16:39] possession in your hand I believe you'd
[2:16:43] start asking questions what is it what
[2:16:50] did you just give me what is it what
[2:16:58] does it do what do you want me to do
[2:17:05] with it
[2:17:07] what's it good for
[2:17:12] how does it work what's the result if
[2:17:21] you use it those are those are questions
[2:17:26] that that you would ask if I was to to
[2:17:33] give you something you'd say what do you
[2:17:36] want me to do with this first of all
[2:17:40] what is it
[2:17:41] what is it that God gave you what is it
[2:17:50] that you possess why did he give it to
[2:17:54] you what of what am I supposed to do
[2:17:58] with it what are we supposed to do with
[2:18:00] it we've all car claiming that we've had
[2:18:06] an encounter with the burning bush
[2:18:11] that's what the baptism of the Holy
[2:18:14] Spirit is it's an encounter with the
[2:18:17] pillar of fire it means that we have met
[2:18:20] him personally we are the guy that stood
[2:18:25] on the holy ground
[2:18:27] we are the guy that was at the burning
[2:18:29] bush when Pharaoh began to talk to Moses
[2:18:33] it like he said he said he said oh you
[2:18:37] just thought you seen a burning bush or
[2:18:43] that was just a roaring wind you thought
[2:18:47] you hear no Moses was the guy that was
[2:18:51] there he was there
[2:18:53] he newly experienced isn't that your
[2:18:56] testimony this morning you're the person
[2:18:58] that meant god you're the one that's had
[2:19:01] the transformation you're the one that's
[2:19:04] received the baptism of the Holy
[2:19:05] Spirit's not an imagination you've had
[2:19:15] the experience I've had the experience
[2:19:22] of being delivered I've had the
[2:19:29] experience of having hatred taken out of
[2:19:33] my heart I hate that I hate that many
[2:19:40] times I never wanted to feel for anybody
[2:19:46] I didn't want to care I didn't want to
[2:19:52] have a burden I didn't want to feel
[2:19:57] sympathy or pity a lot of times those
[2:20:02] emotions cause pain makes you feel
[2:20:09] sometimes weak but when I meet somebody
[2:20:13] and I see that they're under that
[2:20:17] bondage of that lines devil something
[2:20:22] happens in my heart I love that person I
[2:20:27] want that person free from that that
[2:20:31] wasn't me that was that pillar of fire
[2:20:36] that I met that was the effect that it
[2:20:40] had on my life it had an effect if it
[2:20:49] changes you it changes your attitude it
[2:20:52] changes your desires if it changes your
[2:20:55] affections you can't pretend
[2:21:04] when you bend there I know is this
[2:21:11] example to you very many times because
[2:21:14] but it was so dear to me
[2:21:16] and it was a wonderful opportunity that
[2:21:19] brother Bruce Emmanuel gave me to go
[2:21:22] into the center of a nuclear reactor and
[2:21:29] he said now there's radiation everywhere
[2:21:32] in here
[2:21:34] stay behind these lines stay within the
[2:21:39] containment don't get outside that
[2:21:43] containment and I told you that we were
[2:21:49] sitting in front of a great big pool
[2:21:52] maybe a pool this big it seemed brother
[2:21:55] Bruce and in there worse reactor cores
[2:21:58] new and used in EM and they're full of
[2:22:05] radiation and as they slowly release the
[2:22:08] radiation the heat of the radiation
[2:22:10] boils water and it boils the water so
[2:22:14] fast it turns it into steam the steam so
[2:22:17] powerful coming out of there that it
[2:22:18] turns the turbines and it produces
[2:22:21] electricity when that stuffs everywhere
[2:22:24] you can't see it and I remember I was
[2:22:30] looked at over that pond like that and I
[2:22:33] remember excuse me that I stuck out my
[2:22:37] finger and I went to point to the the
[2:22:42] which reactors were cold and which were
[2:22:45] dead and I'll never forget it I got my
[2:22:48] started to put my hand up and and
[2:22:51] brother Bruce's the safety guy out there
[2:22:53] and also you grabbed my hand and threw
[2:22:56] it down I thought what's up
[2:23:04] and I come to find out that if you get
[2:23:10] in to that nuclear feel it they will
[2:23:15] know it you have to walk through a
[2:23:19] machine that detects whether you've got
[2:23:26] it on you or not and if you got it on
[2:23:31] you the alarms go off and the bells go
[2:23:34] off and then there's a whole process and
[2:23:38] everybody in the whole place has got to
[2:23:40] go through it because they don't want
[2:23:42] that whole ego no they don't want that
[2:23:45] hey hey man they don't want that to go
[2:23:50] outside of there
[2:23:51] amen so what I'm saying is if you've
[2:23:54] been in the presence of that pillar of
[2:23:56] fire you will have the effect of that
[2:23:59] spirit on your low and Satan don't want
[2:24:03] it to get outside of you but we're
[2:24:10] called to contaminate the world we are
[2:24:16] the Holy Ghost covert virus of this age
[2:24:22] we are called to contaminate this world
[2:24:26] with the presence of God the one do they
[2:24:33] want to put a mask on you
[2:24:34] they don't want you to open your mouth
[2:24:37] don't wonder they want social distancing
[2:24:40] they don't want you to lay your hands on
[2:24:42] nobody they don't want you to testify
[2:24:49] what's happening to the church what's
[2:24:55] happened to the power this spiritual
[2:25:00] Holy Ghost reactor that's in this room
[2:25:06] where is it
[2:25:09] where are where's the signs of it
[2:25:12] where's the evidence of it what what
[2:25:20] we've got it listen to this statement
[2:25:26] and you can see the burden on my heart
[2:25:33] as I believe time is running out
[2:25:42] Moses being born with this great gift of
[2:25:47] faith then he was anointed and
[2:25:52] commissioned at the burning bush to
[2:25:55] deliver God's people the church was
[2:26:03] called you have not called me you have
[2:26:07] not chosen me I've chosen you go up into
[2:26:11] the bar and wait until you are endued
[2:26:14] with power on high then you are
[2:26:18] commissioned to go into all the world
[2:26:21] preach the gospel lay your hands on this
[2:26:26] if they shall recover if they repent
[2:26:29] they shall be saved go preach repentance
[2:26:34] of sin
[2:26:35] right go preach that repentance and
[2:26:40] remission of sins should be preached
[2:26:43] among all the nations go tell them that
[2:26:48] their sins which are many have been
[2:26:51] forgiven forget trying to give them to
[2:26:59] some intellectual knowledge of God go
[2:27:03] tell them the good news your sins which
[2:27:07] are many thing other sinners what they
[2:27:11] don't know is those sins have been
[2:27:13] forgiven at Calvary go tell them that
[2:27:22] you can repent of your sins and they
[2:27:28] will be forgiven didn't say little sins
[2:27:33] big sins that's Catholic teaching big
[2:27:37] sins little sins God forgives sin God
[2:27:42] replaces unbelief with belief that's
[2:27:46] what the burning bush did to Moses it
[2:27:49] changed unbelief to belief let's just
[2:27:56] read to deliver God's people that's what
[2:28:03] we're commissioned to do go find and
[2:28:08] deliver God's people they're still our
[2:28:14] people are still out there our people
[2:28:18] are still in bondage our people are
[2:28:21] still held by sicknesses that they don't
[2:28:23] are don't need to have why sit you hear
[2:28:35] rise
[2:28:39] when God commissioned people he don't
[2:28:43] want me him halt round about it if
[2:28:49] you're convinced your concern now see
[2:28:53] the great qualities this man had he was
[2:28:59] born for a certain thing God had a
[2:29:03] purpose in it God's got a purpose of you
[2:29:08] being here he does III don't want I'm
[2:29:19] not gonna preach no more questioning
[2:29:21] whether you're a believer huh it's about
[2:29:27] time we have confidence in one another
[2:29:31] it's about time we quit trying to prove
[2:29:35] who we are by works we are who we are
[2:29:41] because God said that too we were and if
[2:29:45] God said so that settlement you are born
[2:29:56] for accuracy if you can only get to that
[2:30:01] place how much trouble you'd save God
[2:30:04] and yourself - I really want to save
[2:30:11] myself trouble because I've had my share
[2:30:16] of it but how much more was should my
[2:30:19] heart be to where I want to save God
[2:30:22] trouble you save yourself in God a lot
[2:30:29] of trouble if you would just start
[2:30:32] accepting that he gave you this power
[2:30:38] for a purpose you know and I see it just
[2:30:45] is plain as day I can see the continents
[2:30:49] on the faces of the people I
[2:30:51] see the darkness that's on their faces
[2:30:53] when the word of God I can see the
[2:30:56] self-judgement that goes on forget about
[2:30:59] yourself for a moment that burning bush
[2:31:07] was burning Moses turned aside to see
[2:31:15] and when he got there that Bush spoke of
[2:31:18] him to him take your shoes off you're
[2:31:22] standing on holy ground Moses didn't say
[2:31:28] Oh how's that bush burning it didn't
[2:31:36] matter how he knew that he was in the
[2:31:41] presence of God he knew that God knew
[2:31:45] everything he knew the secrets of his
[2:31:52] heart he knew where he been he knew what
[2:31:56] he'd done Moses had killed the man
[2:32:03] he knew everything about Moses he knows
[2:32:12] all about you he's not expecting
[2:32:17] anything of you he just wants you to
[2:32:22] come into his presence so he can do the
[2:32:28] changing Moses born and then after he
[2:32:42] was brought to the to the place where he
[2:32:47] was anointed known as the seed lying in
[2:32:51] there with the intellectual conception
[2:32:55] with all the faith that he was born to
[2:33:00] deliver the people and yet it never
[2:33:05] come to life and tell that light from
[2:33:09] the burning bush flashed across it until
[2:33:15] until he seen not something he read
[2:33:19] about not something he'd seen with his
[2:33:23] eyes but something that spoke to him and
[2:33:26] he spoke back to it how that did bring
[2:33:31] things to life now I want you understand
[2:33:36] Moses had a faith I'm gonna say
[2:33:41] something this morning okay and believe
[2:33:45] me I'm to the place now if you wanna
[2:33:48] throw me how back home for like I said I
[2:33:54] got lots of fishing poles but Moses
[2:34:00] believed with the seed that was in him
[2:34:09] but that didn't bring them to life now
[2:34:17] we all claim to have the seed of God
[2:34:20] that's our big claim we've got the seed
[2:34:24] of God we've got the seed of God we got
[2:34:26] the seed of God I'm afraid that our
[2:34:29] faith has come from the seed and not an
[2:34:32] experience from the burning bush there's
[2:34:40] something in you that believes have you
[2:34:44] noticed we all testify we all tell one
[2:34:49] another oh it's the seed it's the seed
[2:34:53] it's the seed the seed is in me okay
[2:35:01] that's why you believe that's our
[2:35:06] doctrine I've got ears I know what comes
[2:35:12] out of my mouth you're the seed you're
[2:35:15] the seed were the seed we be me
[2:35:19] because reseed why do I believe god
[2:35:26] senator prophet because the seed in me
[2:35:31] do you understand Moses was believing
[2:35:36] with the scene but that seed never came
[2:35:45] to life till he had a personal
[2:35:52] experience with the burning bush and he
[2:35:56] spoke to the bush and the bush spoke
[2:36:01] back here ye him that's what he said and
[2:36:15] noticed the seed laying there with the
[2:36:18] intellectual conception with all the
[2:36:21] faith that he was born to deliver this
[2:36:25] people with all the faith that were the
[2:36:28] electrolyte but we're also commissioned
[2:36:32] to deliver this people and yet it never
[2:36:39] come to life so he believed he had
[2:36:45] intellectual conception but that still
[2:36:50] wasn't considered to be brought to life
[2:36:53] now we call it life he said it it to
[2:37:07] life until the light from that burning
[2:37:10] bush flashed across it until he seen not
[2:37:13] something he read about in the message
[2:37:16] of the hour not something he read about
[2:37:19] in the Bible but something he had seen
[2:37:22] with his eyes something that spoke to
[2:37:25] him and he spoke back oh how that did
[2:37:30] bring things to life
[2:37:33] I think any man or woman or boy or girl
[2:37:40] and I think in the intellectual
[2:37:44] conception of what they think the word
[2:37:49] is and so forth never can have a full
[2:37:53] foundation standing until they have
[2:37:56] meant that light that brings that word
[2:38:00] to a reality now I'm not talking about
[2:38:07] the reality of the experience this
[2:38:10] morning I'm talking about the reality of
[2:38:14] the Church's possession of the power
[2:38:22] that they were endued with from on high
[2:38:29] I'm talking this morning about the
[2:38:32] reality of the power that God has placed
[2:38:37] in this body and it's believers not a
[2:38:43] reality of the pillar of fire we have
[2:38:46] that in photograph I could get you the
[2:38:52] drawer and the aisle number and such and
[2:38:55] such that you could find that in
[2:38:56] Washington I'm not talking about the
[2:39:03] reality of the message that it was true
[2:39:08] the reality of the pillar of fire and
[2:39:12] the reality of the cloud and the opening
[2:39:16] of the seven seals I'm not talking about
[2:39:21] the historic reality of this message I'm
[2:39:27] not talking about the reality that
[2:39:31] William branham's that was the name that
[2:39:34] was given to the man that fulfilled the
[2:39:39] prophecies of Malachi 4:5
[2:39:42] Luke 17 30 revelations in 10
[2:39:46] seven I'm not talking about that reality
[2:39:50] I'm talking about the reality of the
[2:39:55] power of the Resurrection that's in this
[2:39:59] building this morning has that been
[2:40:05] brought to a reality
[2:40:10] what's our cry we're elected were seed
[2:40:19] God sowed the seed hello Moses we
[2:40:27] finally got to where Moses was Moses
[2:40:34] knew he was called the deliverer the
[2:40:36] people he went and preached it
[2:40:42] what is intellectual conception and self
[2:40:48] recognition produce a dead Egyptian
[2:40:55] that's what he was going on but he said
[2:41:00] it needs until you have meant he said
[2:41:06] any bargirl man or woman with that
[2:41:09] intellect scepter what they think the
[2:41:11] work isn't so worth never can have a
[2:41:14] full foundation standing until they have
[2:41:17] meant that light and that light brings
[2:41:19] that word to reality let's ask the
[2:41:23] question again
[2:41:24] how many have received the baptism of
[2:41:27] the holy ghost and everywhere yes that
[2:41:33] was what God promised I will send you a
[2:41:36] comforter I will not leave you
[2:41:39] comfortless I personal pronoun will come
[2:41:42] again I'll be with you even in you until
[2:41:45] the end I'll lead you and guide you into
[2:41:49] all truth and righteousness
[2:41:52] so we know that's a reality I think the
[2:41:57] church
[2:42:00] in its practice no matter how
[2:42:05] intellectual and fundamental it might be
[2:42:10] that church cannot thrive until the
[2:42:15] supernatural is made known among that
[2:42:18] people and they see it something that
[2:42:23] they can talk to that talks back to them
[2:42:29] and that vindicates this written word
[2:42:36] now it doesn't matter how fundamental we
[2:42:41] are in our practice our church order our
[2:42:48] adherence to the dress code our
[2:42:53] preaching against sin it doesn't matter
[2:42:59] how fundamentally we are in following
[2:43:06] the message and I believe in sound
[2:43:11] doctrine you know I do I
[2:43:17] I was a lot harder in my younger days on
[2:43:20] enforcement but I understand that that
[2:43:25] nothing can beat the conviction of the
[2:43:28] Holy Spirit nothing beats the Lord
[2:43:37] letting a sister knows that her clothes
[2:43:41] are too tight or her necklines too low
[2:43:46] or her sleeves are too short or her
[2:43:50] dress is too high or her heels are too
[2:43:54] long now I've just preached against all
[2:43:57] of that I didn't have to call anybody
[2:44:04] Jersey Belle
[2:44:09] but if that pillar of fire if that
[2:44:14] burning bush if that holy spirit is
[2:44:17] present in our midst and we understand
[2:44:23] the reality of that presence and that
[2:44:27] reality of that presence is to deliver
[2:44:31] my people when people come into that
[2:44:37] presence that spirit will convict them
[2:44:42] they will know he's here you understand
[2:44:47] they can't feel your intellect they
[2:44:57] can't see your seed Paul said I didn't
[2:45:05] come to you with enticing words of men
[2:45:10] but I came to you in the power and the
[2:45:14] demonstration of the Holy Spirit in
[2:45:18] other words Paul said I meant the pillar
[2:45:22] of fire I was on the road to Damascus
[2:45:26] and I meant the pillar of fire and the
[2:45:29] pillar of fire spoke to me the pillar of
[2:45:31] fire commissioned me now I came to you
[2:45:35] with full confidence that God had called
[2:45:41] me and elected me and I was bringing to
[2:45:44] the Gentile people a deliverance of sin
[2:45:49] and providing them with the baptism of
[2:45:55] the Holy Spirit and it became the
[2:46:00] foundation of the church now remember
[2:46:09] when Moses met this burning bush that
[2:46:13] word was have indicated exactly
[2:46:23] it was the word Moses didn't have to
[2:46:26] worry what this voice
[2:46:30] all's about what is this being here
[2:46:35] because God had already wrote in the
[2:46:40] superinten assist your people with
[2:46:43] sojourn in a strange land but they would
[2:46:46] be brought back after 400 years and
[2:46:48] we'll come back to this country again
[2:46:51] for the iniquity the amorite is not
[2:46:54] fulfilled in other words Moses didn't
[2:46:59] have to ask the question he already knew
[2:47:04] do we have to ask the question are we in
[2:47:08] the end time do it do we have to ask the
[2:47:14] question that were the elect lady know
[2:47:19] what wasn't there supposed to be a
[2:47:21] people in this last day that's called
[2:47:24] out isn't there supposed to be a people
[2:47:27] that was going to be separated by a
[2:47:29] message that was sent forth isn't this
[2:47:33] what the promised in the scripture where
[2:47:38] is that who are they where are they
[2:47:46] somebody show them and so our answer is
[2:47:55] I got the seed now when Paul's answer
[2:48:06] he wanted to know well how are you
[2:48:09] baptized because he knew if they were
[2:48:17] baptized right then the Word of God
[2:48:21] promised them that they would receive
[2:48:25] the gift of the Holy Ghost and the gift
[2:48:28] of the Holy Ghost was the power that was
[2:48:33] in dude from on high to make this
[2:48:37] written word live now this words written
[2:48:48] is that right everybody's reading a
[2:48:53] written word the Methodists read the
[2:48:57] Bible this morning we read the Bible the
[2:48:59] Presbyterians the Baptist of every
[2:49:02] message Church everywhere we all read
[2:49:06] the Bible and people have done all kinds
[2:49:13] of things with their interpretation but
[2:49:20] Jesus's interpretation of this Bible was
[2:49:24] the works that I do you shall do also
[2:49:30] now so we're not talking this morning
[2:49:33] about going and getting the power we're
[2:49:41] not talking this morning about living
[2:49:44] right we're not talking this morning
[2:49:49] about holiness we're not talking this
[2:49:53] morning about the seed you have
[2:49:58] fulfilled all those pala fication x' you
[2:50:05] understand we're not trying you anymore
[2:50:10] we're not trying to give you a test of
[2:50:15] what your motives and objectives is and
[2:50:18] what you're accomplishing
[2:50:20] this scripture simply says do all that's
[2:50:25] in your heart so now this power has a
[2:50:34] motivating factor it's going to be your
[2:50:43] heart love the love of God shed abroad
[2:50:56] in your heart by the Holy Spirit the
[2:51:02] seeds there the powers been given and we
[2:51:09] believed by the seed that's in us
[2:51:16] because the seed was in us is why you
[2:51:20] heard the voice because the seed was in
[2:51:25] you is why you said Amen because the
[2:51:30] seed was seeing you is why that you were
[2:51:33] brought into conviction but now we've
[2:51:39] grown and we've been through the ages
[2:51:43] we've been through the time we've been
[2:51:44] through the churches we've come up to
[2:51:47] the revelation of the seals we're well
[2:51:49] into the third pole we're at the ending
[2:51:52] and the catching away of the of the
[2:51:55] church so we know we've come down to
[2:51:59] that time where the resurrection power
[2:52:05] that was in Christ Jesus that was the
[2:52:09] power that was given it was a quickening
[2:52:16] power something to bring the Word of God
[2:52:20] to life now if you were predestinated
[2:52:25] and your names written on the book and
[2:52:27] your places for the resurrection
[2:52:33] and those scriptures that were written
[2:52:35] were written of you this power brings
[2:52:41] that word to life if not I am going to
[2:52:47] go into the grave if the Lord would
[2:52:49] tarry it's okay with me if he tarries
[2:52:55] that just meant I didn't fulfill that
[2:52:59] part of Scripture that I'm going to
[2:53:02] fulfill a different part of Scripture o
[2:53:07] grave where's your business Oh death
[2:53:11] where is your sting I have a crown
[2:53:14] that's waiting for me I'm going to
[2:53:18] fulfill another part of the scripture
[2:53:21] but that same power had to be there to
[2:53:27] bring to pass the scriptures that were
[2:53:32] written concerning me and that's what
[2:53:39] Jesus was the scriptures were written
[2:53:41] concerning himself you understand
[2:53:44] there's been scriptures written and
[2:53:46] prophecies made concerning you now
[2:53:51] there's got to be something that
[2:53:56] encounters the individual for them to
[2:54:01] bring the individual word that has been
[2:54:07] prophesied and spoken of them to pass
[2:54:11] and I'm sorry I got a wave this big meet
[2:54:15] at you but I haven't learned to preach
[2:54:18] with my left hand yet so you understand
[2:54:22] I'm talking about I'm saying we're
[2:54:27] moving past the seed we're moving past
[2:54:32] the power we've got it now where where
[2:54:38] Moses was why sit ye here
[2:54:44] arise when do we start
[2:54:51] to use the power that we have when do we
[2:54:56] quit crying and speak now remember what
[2:55:01] motivates it see this is where everybody
[2:55:05] got off on this nonsense of speak the
[2:55:08] word speak the word I always started
[2:55:12] getting around so how can you speak
[2:55:13] something that you're not how many times
[2:55:19] have you heard to say to one another
[2:55:20] just speak the word you know and so
[2:55:27] everybody wants to prove their faith by
[2:55:29] speaking the word no you'll never prove
[2:55:31] your faith by speaking the word you know
[2:55:34] what proves your faith is your heart do
[2:55:41] all that's in your heart you come across
[2:55:45] somebody and they're in bondage if your
[2:55:55] heart don't bleed you're not gonna be
[2:55:59] able to do nothing for them you're not
[2:56:05] going to be moved and maybe your heart
[2:56:11] doesn't always bleed for everything but
[2:56:15] I'll guarantee you God works on both
[2:56:17] ends he'll brief somebody by you and you
[2:56:22] don't know why but your hearts burdened
[2:56:29] you hate the bondage they're in you hate
[2:56:34] the devil that's got them broke down and
[2:56:42] here you've got the power but you run
[2:56:47] off to your prayer closet and you say oh
[2:56:54] God
[2:56:55] Oh God
[2:56:58] Oh God the Prophet said God finally got
[2:57:01] tired of it he said didn't I give you
[2:57:05] the power didn't I prove to your here
[2:57:09] the bride in the last stage didn't I
[2:57:12] show you that this is lady hacia didn't
[2:57:15] I show you the pillar of fire didn't I
[2:57:18] quit in the seed that's in you haven't I
[2:57:24] done everything there is to prove to you
[2:57:28] that you're that elect lady haven't I
[2:57:32] done everything to you to show you that
[2:57:36] you're anointed you've got the power but
[2:57:50] the powers to bring that word to a
[2:57:53] reality when twin when this is my
[2:58:00] question the church will never prosper
[2:58:03] until its believers have the love of God
[2:58:11] in their heart because without perfect
[2:58:15] love you will not be there when there's
[2:58:18] no more shame about the reproach there's
[2:58:26] no more there's no more how can I say
[2:58:37] that reserve but you accounted the
[2:58:43] esteem of Christ more glorious than all
[2:58:47] the riches of the world
[2:58:50] Moses esteemed his calling and election
[2:58:54] greater than all the riches of Egypt
[2:58:57] when you're there - and I had another
[2:59:01] statement that I was going to read to
[2:59:04] you but I won't - all close now as I can
[2:59:07] continue this another service
[2:59:12] but he esteemed what God had called him
[2:59:19] for greater than anything else the
[2:59:25] kingdom of God is like a man that's
[2:59:28] received a great treasure and he sells
[2:59:34] all that he can that he might possess
[2:59:37] that treasure you have been given this
[2:59:45] morning every single person in here who
[2:59:50] has meant the pillar of fire the pillar
[2:59:54] of fire is the Holy Ghost the abstract
[3:00:01] is the Holy Ghost the power that came
[3:00:04] from the father above was the Holy
[3:00:07] Spirit the Holy Spirit is the presence
[3:00:11] of God any person that's ever come into
[3:00:16] the presence of God and been transformed
[3:00:22] by that presence just like I said if you
[3:00:26] put your hand into that radioactive
[3:00:29] field there's no way of faking it you
[3:00:34] got it it's on you you can't shake it
[3:00:43] off you can't wash it off it will be
[3:00:46] detected and if you've been there you
[3:00:56] possess it because he cannot lie so the
[3:01:03] powers here this morning
[3:01:04] let us reasons we close
[3:01:12] I don't know what I did with that other
[3:01:16] page and we'll read this I think he know
[3:01:31] that the time of the scriptures an all
[3:01:34] said that they'd already been there for
[3:01:38] hundred years just as we know now as a
[3:01:43] man asked me a few minutes ago about the
[3:01:46] coming and the rapture we know we're
[3:01:49] living the time out the time of the
[3:01:53] rapture is at hand and we're looking for
[3:01:58] a rapturing faith that can pull the
[3:02:01] church together and give it supernatural
[3:02:06] strength that can change these bodies
[3:02:09] that were living in we see a God that
[3:02:14] can raise the dead off the floor or out
[3:02:18] in the yard and bring him back to life
[3:02:21] again and the presence of him before us
[3:02:26] when we see of God who can take a cancer
[3:02:30] that's eaten a man to his shadow and
[3:02:32] raise him up to be a strong healthy man
[3:02:35] that ought to get that ought to give
[3:02:39] rapturing faith to the people that when
[3:02:44] that light flashes across from the sky
[3:02:47] and the Trump sounds the body of Christ
[3:02:51] will be quickly gathered together and
[3:02:54] changed in a moment and taken into
[3:02:56] heavens yes there's got to be something
[3:03:01] like that happen and our schools of
[3:03:05] theology can never produce that yet they
[3:03:10] intellectually are all right but we've
[3:03:14] got to meet that light we've got to find
[3:03:19] that something
[3:03:24] we've got to find that something each of
[3:03:27] us this morning has God to find that
[3:03:32] something that makes this word live in
[3:03:37] us and not only in us but makes this
[3:03:42] word live for others we've got to find
[3:03:56] that something and hear Moses basing his
[3:04:01] great calling upon the word and it was
[3:04:05] great until one day he meant this light
[3:04:10] and the very word itself spoke back to
[3:04:14] him then he got his anointing that
[3:04:21] anointed what he had in him that on the
[3:04:27] inside the intellect that believed it
[3:04:32] the faith that was based upon his belief
[3:04:37] in God that separated him from his
[3:04:42] mother so we're sitting here this
[3:04:46] morning we've all got faith we all
[3:04:50] believe we've all got the seed now we
[3:04:57] need something that brings that calling
[3:05:04] and that quickening to life something
[3:05:10] that we're died out for it something
[3:05:13] that this morning if somebody needs to
[3:05:15] come up for prayer and be prayed for and
[3:05:19] have the faithful wait hands-on that
[3:05:22] they might receive a deliverance or they
[3:05:25] might receive a healing that that comes
[3:05:28] to pass that we're no longer taking it
[3:05:32] and throwing it up to heaven
[3:05:37] and saying god take care of this but
[3:05:41] we're standing here saying I'm
[3:05:43] commissioned to take care of this I have
[3:05:48] been called to lay my hands on the sick
[3:05:51] and them see receive their deliverance
[3:05:56] and when we can see that about one
[3:05:59] another I'm going to go stand up for
[3:06:02] prayer I'm sick in my body and these
[3:06:06] people are called and elected and
[3:06:12] commissioned and have the power to lay
[3:06:15] their hands on me and I'll recover he
[3:06:22] doesn't want to be a god living in
[3:06:24] heaven anymore he wants to be a God
[3:06:26] living in his people
[3:06:29] we are the inhabitants with the faith
[3:06:37] upon his belief in God that's separating
[3:06:41] him his mother and now when he strikes
[3:06:43] in the presence of this light it
[3:06:46] anointed that that he believed what an
[3:06:53] anointing and he was commissioned now we
[3:06:58] know intellectually he heard his mother
[3:07:01] we know what was going to take place he
[3:07:05] know he was living in that day but where
[3:07:09] he found out that he was a failure so
[3:07:13] might his faith might have dropped back
[3:07:16] a little bit but when he comes to that
[3:07:20] bush God said I've heard the cry of my
[3:07:23] people and I remember my promise to
[3:07:26] their father Abraham Isaac and Jacob and
[3:07:28] I have come down personal pronoun I have
[3:07:34] come down to deliver them
[3:07:39] hey man he's here he's come down and
[3:07:44] he's called us to perform that word
[3:07:51] we've got to get back to work
[3:07:55] we've got to start using this power
[3:08:00] we've got to start dealing with all the
[3:08:04] questions that are keeping us from
[3:08:08] testifying from praying for the sick we
[3:08:14] let one scripture strangle us to death
[3:08:17] don't cast your pearls before swine well
[3:08:26] that's what Peter saw great big blanket
[3:08:34] come down full of swine and he said oh
[3:08:38] god forbid that I'd cast my furrow
[3:08:43] before swine and he said don't you call
[3:08:47] unclean but I have cleansed and the
[3:08:53] blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from
[3:08:55] all unrighteousness we are called to go
[3:08:58] preach the remission of sins and
[3:09:02] repentance we are called to bring the
[3:09:06] power that you have to the people I
[3:09:11] thought of that saying power to the
[3:09:14] people and I thought oh yes praise God
[3:09:20] the power in the people to the people no
[3:09:29] church will prosper until supernaturally
[3:09:33] we can start bringing the promises to
[3:09:38] pass if you've lived by the faith that
[3:09:47] you received from your seat
[3:09:53] you believe because the seed inside of
[3:09:56] you has believed I'm asking you that you
[3:10:03] slip away and come contact face to face
[3:10:11] that you personally come into his
[3:10:13] presence
[3:10:14] and that seed that's in you becomes
[3:10:19] anointed for the purpose that he has
[3:10:24] called you and commissioned you we're
[3:10:30] moving out from the seat from the faith
[3:10:35] of the seed to the experience of the
[3:10:41] bush the real elect church is moving
[3:10:48] from the faith of the seed to the
[3:10:54] experience of the bush putting into
[3:11:00] action the anointed Commission upon the
[3:11:07] power that God has placed in them
[3:11:13] everyone has a power in here for
[3:11:18] somebody might be a friend might be a
[3:11:25] workplace might be a loved one but you
[3:11:29] have the power to impart eternal life
[3:11:32] you have the power to make a difference
[3:11:36] you have the power in my heart I stand
[3:11:40] here and I say old gone how can this
[3:11:46] power be unleashed in me how can I get
[3:11:53] in what place do I have to get to where
[3:11:58] I can bring this power to a lost and
[3:12:03] dying
[3:12:05] generation will I accept that I'm the
[3:12:09] last chance this world will ever get to
[3:12:13] see the truth my word is truth God sent
[3:12:25] a messenger you know it you've got the
[3:12:28] power to spread it you've got the power
[3:12:31] to proof that every promise in this book
[3:12:34] is true not only do you have the power
[3:12:36] you're elected and chosen of God to do
[3:12:40] it and he'll stand with you he'll not
[3:12:43] leave you he'll not forsake you he'll be
[3:12:47] with you even in you till the end
[3:12:49] what hindereth us let's don't be
[3:12:52] hindered no more
[3:12:55] let's arise let's take up our cross
[3:13:00] let's follow him
[3:13:03] let's testify let's pray for the sick
[3:13:07] let's pray for people deliverance let's
[3:13:10] tell people about it he'll stand with
[3:13:13] you he'll be with you
[3:13:15] why cry unto me speak and go forward
[3:13:24] I've already called you I've already
[3:13:26] commissioned you already proved you
[3:13:28] there's nothing more I can do
[3:13:31] you are the bride now let's show the
[3:13:37] world where the bride God proves his
[3:13:40] people by vindication that's it we'll go
[3:13:43] into that sermon another day how many
[3:13:45] believes it this morning the question is
[3:13:48] is that the desire of your heart do you
[3:13:50] want to make a difference in other
[3:13:53] people's lives I do let's stand together
[3:13:56] brother Billy would you come
[3:14:02] I don't title my sermons but if I
[3:14:13] probably would call this sermon it's
[3:14:16] more than the seed that's in me it's
[3:14:22] more than the faith that's coming from
[3:14:25] my seed there's something greater that
[3:14:30] God's got for us and I believe it and I
[3:14:34] desire it I don't know if anybody would
[3:14:37] like prayer this morning I invited a
[3:14:39] young lady to come to prayer and if she
[3:14:42] would like to do that I would love to
[3:14:45] pray for her
[3:14:47] [Music]
[3:14:49] you say why because I know a god that
[3:14:55] can do exceedingly and abundantly above
[3:14:57] what we could ask her thing I know a God
[3:15:02] that can give her the desire of her
[3:15:04] heart
[3:15:09] she may not feel comfortable but I want
[3:15:17] to give the opportunity because I know
[3:15:22] this God
[3:15:24] [Music]
[3:15:26] and I know what this God can do and if
[3:15:31] you're brokenhearted this morning if
[3:15:33] you're battling if you're struggling if
[3:15:36] you can't overcome if you'd make your
[3:15:41] way to the presence of that burning bush
[3:15:44] if you just step into that presence and
[3:15:47] let him and I say this people this
[3:15:51] morning has the power that power is here
[3:15:58] it's in this people to pray for you and
[3:16:03] you be well that power is in this elect
[3:16:08] bride here this morning to pray and
[3:16:11] receive that deliverance the powers in
[3:16:15] here this morning for you to be free
[3:16:18] from a burden or a habit that bounds you
[3:16:21] down where is it it's not here
[3:16:25] it's here you have the power let us pray
[3:16:33] if you feel that the body of believers
[3:16:37] the elect lady of Christ the bride of
[3:16:41] this last day the anointed elected
[3:16:47] people that have received the power of
[3:16:51] the Resurrection
[3:16:56] that if they ask in nowise will you be
[3:17:00] turned away
[3:17:01] let us pray our Heavenly Father we know
[3:17:14] that the seed went into the ground and
[3:17:18] as a seed came up in the ages and the
[3:17:25] last day the ship pulls away from the
[3:17:28] seed then that grain of seed sets in the
[3:17:34] sunlight and it ripens to full maturity
[3:17:43] until it becomes possessors of the
[3:17:48] resurrection itself
[3:17:52] and all that was in the church all that
[3:17:58] was in God was poured into Christ and
[3:18:02] how this church comes to the place it
[3:18:05] ripens in the Sun and all that was in
[3:18:09] Christ is poured into it and it becomes
[3:18:20] United with the word and them in the
[3:18:25] word become one and then he says the
[3:18:29] works that I do you shall do also and
[3:18:38] Lord we asked this morning that each of
[3:18:41] us in our heart would take that personal
[3:18:46] this morning that we take a moment to
[3:18:51] sit at our table to kneel at our cow
[3:18:59] just sit in the car then ask ourselves
[3:19:05] what am i doing for the kingdom of God
[3:19:11] what am i doing with the power that's in
[3:19:14] my life it's been freely given and now
[3:19:20] I'm to freely give what I what am I
[3:19:24] doing with what you gave me what did you
[3:19:29] give it to me for why did you give me
[3:19:32] the power of the Resurrection so I can
[3:19:37] resurrect others why did you give me
[3:19:41] healing power so that I could heal why
[3:19:46] did you give me salvation that I could
[3:19:49] save
[3:19:54] it's the power that does it it's not the
[3:19:57] person Lord and you've imparted into
[3:20:00] this church or not preached a message
[3:20:04] what are we building and Lord this is my
[3:20:08] heart we want a church that administers
[3:20:16] the power that you've given each
[3:20:19] individual fulfilling the anointing and
[3:20:24] the purpose that you place there nor
[3:20:30] reality I would like to pray we'd be
[3:20:32] happy to pray with them join our faith
[3:20:36] with the faith of the people of this
[3:20:38] building because you promised that
[3:20:42] whatever we ask for would come to pass
[3:20:46] and that power is present in this people

[3:29:04] someone or mention the gospel Lord and
[3:29:07] we might have missed it
[3:29:08] father we ask that you forgive us or we
[3:29:10] pray that you would give us another
[3:29:11] opportunity Lord maybe friends family
[3:29:14] those on the job those at school or they
[3:29:17] already see a life we may be the only
[3:29:19] gospel that they see the only time that
[3:29:21] there be an outlet where something can
[3:29:23] be spoke to them the Lord may we be able
[3:29:25] to put this flesh aside Lord and let
[3:29:27] that see let that holy spirit that's
[3:29:29] within us I would be able to speak out
[3:29:31] to your people Lord we know we can't
[3:29:33] leave this place all all your children
[3:29:35] are gathering in Lord and we're your
