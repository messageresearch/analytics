[40:34] preach at the end nobody would have
[40:36] understood anything you said darkness
[40:39] you don't even try to adventure
[40:43] me and when brother billy uh greeted me
[40:46] outside

[41:32] my ponzi i believe that lord will help
[41:35] that my thought will go across
[41:38] [Music]
[41:41] from the scripture we write in leviticus
[41:48] i would like to title my little thought
[41:50] tonight
[41:54] the the harvest was already accepted
[41:59] in this scripture in leviticus
[42:09] when they left egypt to the promised
[42:11] land
[42:13] under the the guide of moses sula
[42:16] conducted
[42:17] under the guiding of god himself
[42:21] because god made a promise to abraham
[42:26] that your prosperity will your posterity
[42:29] will go in the country
[42:32] that they will go into slavery
[42:35] and then after 400 years
[42:40] i will deliver them myself
[42:47] and when the children of israel found
[42:49] themselves in nature
[42:53] when they went into slavery
[43:10] go to moses
[43:14] unto the jew moses was this mighty hand
[43:17] of god
[43:20] to deliver the children of israel
[43:24] if god guided these people through moses
[43:31] he was there with them under the
[43:33] disguise of the pillar of fire
[43:36] london and it was the cloud by day
[43:40] yes and these people
[43:44] was under the guidance of god
[43:49] these people were waiting for something
[43:51] from god a jedi
[43:55] and god was giving these people
[43:56] instructions
[43:59] god gave them what they had to do hey
[44:02] don't leave the leviticus
[44:05] this book of leviticus chapter 23
[44:09] [Music]
[44:11] god was asking moses to tell to the
[44:13] children of israel
[44:17] to to to observe certain feasts
[44:31] we'll see that there was a lot of feast
[44:33] that that god will ask the children of
[44:35] israel to observe
[44:38] he was asking them to to observe the the
[44:41] feast of uh
[44:43] passover
[44:47] and we know that the feast of passover
[44:50] la premiere shows
[44:51] la la premiere the first time that they
[44:55] celebrated this
[44:57] feast of passover
[45:01] it was when they had to leave egypt to
[45:03] go into the promised land
[45:08] and god asked them to remember that
[45:12] that they may always have in their minds
[45:14] is that the angel escape that one day
[45:16] they were slaves
[45:20] that god in his goodness
[45:23] god in his mercy
[45:27] he came and he thought about uh
[45:29] delivering them
[45:30] upon
[45:40] that without the grace of god there was
[45:42] no deliverance
[45:45] and then after that feast of passover
[45:47] either please don't
[45:49] they had other feasts a lot of other
[45:51] feasts that they had to observe
[45:53] come la fete depends on liver that the
[45:55] feast of the
[45:56] bread without leaven la fete de
[45:58] tabernacle
[46:10] and there's one of the feasts that we
[46:11] read in verse nine
[46:13] oh jealous where god is giving them an
[46:16] instruction
[46:20] that when you will be in the country
[46:23] that i promised you
[46:26] when you have uh gather up your harvest
[46:31] position when you have come to the
[46:34] position that i want you to be
[46:39] when you will be in the land of promise
[46:44] when you will have and reap your harvest
[46:48] you want to take a a a a a a
[46:51] sheave you want to take the first fruit
[46:56] of that that that harvest
[47:02] you're going to bring it to the priest
[47:10] and the priest will wave the sheave on
[47:12] one side
[47:13] and the other side
[47:20] and the priest will wave the sheave the
[47:22] next day of the sabbath
[47:29] and we knew we know that the the this
[47:31] sheave wave
[47:32] was only the first fruit of the harvest
[47:40] when you can you can only go and harvest
[47:43] the fruit
[47:44] only when the seed has come to maturity
[47:50] agita
[47:53] and the priest had to wave it one side
[47:55] and the other side
[47:56] the next day of the heart of the sabbath
[48:00] so it's the first day of the week
[48:14] it was only a type of the new testament
[48:33] not model it was our model amen
[48:38] the word made flesh
[48:44] and christ when he came on earth
[48:50] he said unless the grain of wheat goes
[48:53] into the ground it is
[48:56] unless the grain of wheat goes into the
[48:59] ground
[49:00] it abides
[49:14] and those fruit has also have to come to
[49:17] maturity
[49:22] so this sheave that was to be waved on
[49:24] one side and the other
[49:28] sacrifices you have to understand that
[49:31] the high priest or the priest could not
[49:34] wave the sheave
[49:35] on the day of the sabbath
[49:39] and we know that sabbath for the for the
[49:41] jews is saturday
[49:49] the next day the first day which is
[49:51] sunday
[49:53] sacrifice
[49:56] was the day that the priest was to wave
[49:58] the sheave
[49:59] they're like that's why christ
[50:05] who was this seed that came to maturity
[50:10] who was
[50:55] the resurrection of jesus christ set up
[50:58] for prove it was to prove
[51:00] god that the price was paid
[51:06] that god may open a door for each and
[51:08] every one of us
[51:11] so we can come to the maturity
[51:16] that's what god is calling us too
[51:59] to be tempted as a man whoever come
[52:02] enough to be
[52:33] it was the first cone of god the gods
[52:36] wheat
[52:36] that had to be raised from the dead le
[52:40] premier grande jew god god's first
[52:43] corn of wheat palace
[53:00] and he was the first fruit of those that
[53:02] sleep
[53:04] the first fruit
[53:07] he was the sheep voila
[53:15] that's what it says that's why they had
[53:17] to waive
[53:18] that shift for for it was the first one
[53:22] that came to maturity okay
[53:33] and it was waived as a memorial of
[53:36] thanksgiving to god
[53:37] that to thanksgiving to god
[53:45] believing that the rest of them would
[53:47] come to it
[53:48] it was a sign so when christ
[53:52] resurrected that is
[54:00] that was proving that god accepted the
[54:03] harvest
[54:05] that god accepted us
[54:08] until
[54:36] the rest of the children of god
[54:39] they are also accepted
[54:41] [Applause]
[54:45] god has already accepted us
[54:50] god promised it through christ
[54:53] but it's for us
[54:57] it's to come it's for us to come to the
[54:59] promised land
[55:01] to take hold of the promise that is
[55:11] to be certain that we are part of that
[55:13] harvest because
[55:16] that what god did with christ
[55:23] not just that he can do it he dwells
[55:26] that he has to do it but guys yes you
[55:29] remember because
[55:30] jesus himself says your faith
[55:46] as your heavenly father is perfect
[55:50] when christ said be he perfect
[55:54] he knows that we can be perfect
[55:59] even when we feel our own weaknesses
[56:01] mankind is some fable
[56:03] even when we are weak paul tells us
[56:10] that the perfect strength of god is
[56:12] manifested in perfect weakness
[56:14] come
[57:10] i am going
[57:11] [Applause]
[57:23] himself he was saying to his disciples
[57:28] i will not leave you alone i will come
[57:31] to you again
[57:33] i will be in you until the end of the
[57:38] world
[58:05] the holy spirit that's death will come
[58:08] upon you
[58:12] and you will make of you my witnesses
[58:18] and the day of the pentecostal
[58:22] i want you to observe these disciples
[58:24] that were cowardly
[58:27] they walked with jesus all the time
[58:31] they heard the preaching of jesus christ
[59:02] we see peter even come to deny jesus
[59:08] we see the two disciples on the way to
[59:10] emmaus
[59:11] just completely uh just uh lost
[59:45] the holy spirit of god that destiny from
[59:47] them
[59:48] it came upon them on uh in the form of
[59:51] the then
[59:53] and the tongues of fire fall upon him
[59:58] i want you to realize these people who
[59:59] were scared they're joking
[1:00:02] the people who lost hope
[1:00:05] when they received this power
[1:00:09] when they were shaken they came out of
[1:00:12] the upper room
[1:00:15] filled with power filled with courage
[1:00:22] because they knew they received
[1:00:23] something
[1:00:27] they knew that the same thing that
[1:00:29] brought christ to maturity
[1:00:32] the facts that the promise that christ
[1:00:34] made god
[1:00:35] sent the speaking of the dead but the
[1:00:38] holy spirit that was supposed to descend
[1:00:40] upon them
[1:00:56] we noticed last sunday new presidency
[1:01:00] we were preaching on feasts
[1:01:03] there was the feast of the pentecost
[1:01:08] and between the feasts of the pentecost
[1:01:10] and the feast of the trumpet
[1:01:14] there was a long period of time exactly
[1:01:19] exactly 50 days between the feast of
[1:01:22] pentecost and the fist of the trumpet
[1:01:27] and 50 the harvest 50 days
[1:01:30] and pentecost means 50.
[1:01:35] it was the sheave waving
[1:01:41] the the first fruit of the harvest
[1:01:44] was brought in
[1:01:49] and we see it was a type back there a
[1:01:52] local
[1:01:52] premise naturally represented a premise
[1:01:55] you sentence me
[1:01:56] with a natural uh fresh fruit
[1:01:58] representing the first fruit of the holy
[1:02:00] spirit
[1:02:03] to be poured upon the people
[1:02:09] and we find out then that them that
[1:02:11] there was 50 days
[1:02:15] was received by the gentiles
[1:02:20] which god called the gentile people
[1:02:23] for his name
[1:02:26] the feast of the pentecost
[1:02:30] and we have been going through the long
[1:02:33] feasts
[1:02:36] of pentecost
[1:02:40] it was another opportunity to wave the
[1:02:43] sheaves
[1:02:46] to say that outside of christ who was
[1:02:48] the first fruit
[1:02:49] he is christ who was the first among us
[1:02:55] there is a part of the seed the
[1:02:57] foundation
[1:02:59] the foundation of the seed
[1:03:04] that has also come to maturity
[1:03:08] that the priest had to wave
[1:03:12] to see that the harvest was accepted
[1:03:18] the holy spirit fallen upon the
[1:03:20] disciples the center through
[1:03:22] the holy spirit upon the disciples
[1:03:27] and when the holy spirit came upon the
[1:03:29] disciples
[1:03:31] the life that was in christ
[1:03:34] the power that was in christ
[1:03:38] fall upon the the disciples
[1:03:41] and tells us
[1:03:54] and when the holy spirit is descended
[1:03:56] that
[1:04:09] has shown that they had come to maturity
[1:04:14] and what i promised
[1:04:19] when peter preached his first sermon on
[1:04:21] the day of pentecost
[1:04:42] that every one of you may be baptized in
[1:04:43] the name of jesus in the name of jesus
[1:04:47] for the forgiveness of your sins
[1:04:51] don't descend and you shall receive the
[1:04:53] gift of the holy ghost
[1:04:56] every what what god asked for
[1:05:00] it was for us to repent on yourself
[1:05:05] and for us to be baptized in the name of
[1:05:07] jesus
[1:05:09] and the remaining is no longer our
[1:05:11] problem
[1:05:13] and you shall receive and he says
[1:05:19] this promise is for you for your
[1:05:22] children
[1:05:25] and all that are far off oh no
[1:05:30] as many as our lord god shall call god
[1:06:01] if you also accepted this question
[1:06:06] if you only believe that this promise is
[1:06:08] also for you
[1:06:10] a prescription and you follow the
[1:06:12] prescription of peter
[1:06:15] god is obligated to give you the holy
[1:06:19] spirit
[1:06:22] god is under obligation
[1:06:27] to bring you into this harvest that was
[1:06:30] already accepted
[1:06:38] he watches upon his promise for him to
[1:06:40] bring it to pass
[1:06:44] what god is asking from us it's to
[1:06:47] accept it
[1:06:49] to believe it it's for us to take hold
[1:06:54] on regardless of circumstances that are
[1:06:58] coming before us
[1:07:01] let's do a caleb
[1:07:05] when they went to inspect the country
[1:07:12] they were uh children children of anarch
[1:07:16] it was the jebusites and they were
[1:07:20] tall and big man
[1:07:23] and there was a reality that presented
[1:07:25] in front of them
[1:07:28] that they were like grasshoppers in
[1:07:30] front of those people
[1:07:32] it was true easy take on this they were
[1:07:35] like grasshopper before them
[1:07:38] but those it was only eyes that were
[1:07:40] looking
[1:07:42] at but when caleb
[1:07:45] looked through with the eyes of god
[1:07:48] he said that's true we are like
[1:07:50] grasshoppers
[1:07:54] but god told us that this country
[1:07:56] belonged to us
[1:07:59] how is god going to make me take this
[1:08:01] country i don't know
[1:08:04] but all i know
[1:08:07] that god told me that this country
[1:08:09] belonged to us who said
[1:08:10] your sister all i know that i'm sure of
[1:08:14] take a dream
[1:08:18] that god told me the promise of the holy
[1:08:20] spirit is mine
[1:08:21] color christians you must i don't care
[1:08:24] how
[1:08:25] how strong is the uh pressure of the
[1:08:27] world in the united states
[1:08:30] i don't care just take a job for me i
[1:08:32] know god promised me you
[1:08:34] said this promise
[1:08:48] god can do so that i can become like
[1:08:50] christ you have for me because your
[1:08:52] dwarf
[1:08:53] when you come here god promised that i
[1:08:55] must become like jesus
[1:09:00] god promised that jesus died to take my
[1:09:03] place
[1:09:04] and
[1:09:08] it means i don't have any place in the
[1:09:10] world
[1:09:11] the only place that belongs to me is for
[1:09:14] me to take jesus place
[1:09:21] because the harvest was already accepted
[1:09:26] the bible tells us romans chapter 8
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:32] let's take verse 11 and 12.
[1:09:40] the romans chapter 8 is is a marvelous
[1:09:44] scripture that i
[1:09:55] but if the spirit of him that raised
[1:09:57] christ from the dead dwells in you
[1:10:08] he that raised christ from the dead
[1:10:10] shall also quicken your mortal body by
[1:10:13] his spirit that dwells in you
[1:10:17] therefore brethren
[1:10:23] we are not deaders we are we are we are
[1:10:26] we are debtors not to the flesh to live
[1:10:28] after the flesh
[1:10:31] here we notice the bible is telling us
[1:10:35] because he listens that if the spirit
[1:10:37] yeah
[1:10:40] that raised christ from the dead still
[1:10:55] it will also quicken our mortal bodies
[1:11:00] his second knew that when they called
[1:11:02] mortal he knows the spirit knows that we
[1:11:04] have moral bodies
[1:11:05] he said what they call the he
[1:11:08] knows that we have bodies of sin
[1:11:10] he said
[1:11:13] he knows that we are conceiving iniquity
[1:11:16] and born in sin
[1:11:17] is second he knows that we live in an
[1:11:22] environment of sin milan
[1:11:25] but he said that he will take off his
[1:11:27] spirit he'll make that on
[1:11:29] he will put that spirit in it
[1:11:33] and when he had put that spirit in us
[1:11:35] even
[1:11:36] fiercer he will quicken
[1:11:55] it will bring this body to submission
[1:11:57] like the body of christ
[1:12:02] it will bring this body to live the word
[1:12:04] of god
[1:12:05] but one of them says he
[1:12:09] killed project it says what does it do

[1:13:29] all that we have to do
[1:13:43] what does it do
[1:14:10] by the act that was accomplished at the
[1:14:13] cross
[1:14:15] christ he's bringing us back to life
[1:14:19] christ is bringing us life the father of
[1:14:21] the kingdom

[1:14:36] he cannot bring us to a place to believe
[1:14:39] that the son of an act at all

[1:14:46] because the the harvest was already
[1:14:49] accepted
[1:14:51] has not been accepted today was already
[1:14:54] accepted
[1:15:00] it's for us to grab hold of the promise

[1:16:54] was resurrected
[1:16:57] that the same spirit that raised christ
[1:16:59] from the dead
[1:17:12] that when i received the holy spirit

[1:17:30] did a man a lot
[1:17:31] of jew i say amen to every word

[1:17:42] rejoice and we will scream
[1:17:44] amen to say amen to the word of god

[1:17:58] [Music]
[1:18:11] to be adapted to us
[1:18:15] but it's for us to be to adapt to the

[1:20:58] your body
[1:21:26] you've heard
[1:21:36] from denomination to the world
[1:22:03] the the harvest was already accepted
[1:22:09] let's go back to the book of romans le
[1:22:12] chapito
[1:22:13] chapter eight is a real verse
[1:22:17] i'm gonna go to verse 28 the bible tells
[1:22:21] us
[1:22:23] and we know gratuitous shoes that are
[1:22:25] all things
[1:22:28] work together for good of them that love
[1:22:30] god the cirque de santa please
[1:22:33] who are called according to his purpose
[1:22:49] he know that he knows us today
[1:22:58] those that he
[1:23:05] he foreign did predestinate to be
[1:23:08] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:23:11] affair
[1:23:13] the premiere don't preserve
[1:23:17] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:23:19] many brothers
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:22] christ was the firstborn
[1:23:25] christ was the first fruit don't please
[1:23:28] the afraid
[1:23:29] of many brothers who
[1:23:32] who are the brotherands it's you and i
[1:23:36] are true
[1:23:41] it's you and i that are his brother and
[1:23:43] he continues and he continues
[1:24:00] it's because god called us that blessing
[1:24:02] and if he called us
[1:24:06] because he knew us before the foundation
[1:24:08] of the past
[1:24:10] it's because he predestinated us that he
[1:24:13] called us tonight
[1:24:21] i have a scripture that i love
[1:24:25] it's when i read amos the bible says
[1:24:31] that god will send uh famine and and
[1:24:34] hunger amos uh
[1:24:37] 8 11.
[1:24:42] don't let we'll have the famine
[1:24:46] and the thirst to hear the word of god
[1:24:51] they will go from one side to the other
[1:24:53] yeah
[1:24:55] they'll go from uh the the the
[1:24:58] orient to the occident
[1:25:02] to look for the word of the lord
[1:25:06] but they won't find it
[1:25:08] [Music]
[1:25:23] and they are condemned
[1:25:41] and when god knew that we couldn't find
[1:25:43] ourselves in that promise
[1:25:47] and that he couldn't change his mind
[1:25:48] also
[1:25:51] because god opened a special breach
[1:25:55] it says for you that are fearing my name
[1:26:00] but for you that i knew before the
[1:26:01] foundation of the world
[1:26:04] here it is
[1:26:19] the word it means god knew you before
[1:26:23] the foundation of the world
[1:26:26] it means god predestinated you
[1:26:29] and that's why he called you tonight and
[1:26:32] he says
[1:26:49] a circular and whom he called
[1:26:54] them he also justified hallelujah
[1:26:57] hallelujah
[1:27:01] and justify means
[1:27:05] that when you repent
[1:27:11] when you feel bad about the past that
[1:27:13] you had
[1:27:16] when you when you feel bad about the
[1:27:18] wrong that you're dead
[1:27:21] when you present yourself before god
[1:27:23] it's a prosecution
[1:27:24] god takes that sin
[1:27:28] he trusted in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:27:40] he can't even remember that you sinned
[1:27:42] one day of your life
[1:27:59] done it to begin with to succeed yes
[1:28:05] that is
[1:28:06] difficult to to to take part into this
[1:28:08] job
[1:28:10] it's just to repent it says
[1:28:15] and the remaining is my blessing and the
[1:28:18] remaining is no longer your problem
[1:28:24] if your neighbor could say look that so
[1:28:26] this one did such and such yesterday
[1:28:29] when god looks at you he says no he
[1:28:32] never done nothing
[1:28:33] he'd never done wrong it's a son of god
[1:28:55] because when you forgive a person you
[1:28:58] can remember that the person said
[1:29:01] but when he justified that he he
[1:29:04] forgives
[1:29:05] and he forgets
[1:29:23] men are identification he brings us
[1:29:26] into the identification of his son he
[1:29:28] knows that men are completely many shows
[1:29:31] because of his he brings us to to
[1:29:34] to do the same works that his son did
[1:29:38] in his glory he glorifies us
[1:29:42] he brings us to adoption
[1:29:46] he brings us into his image
[1:29:49] it was such wonderful paul says
[1:29:54] he says what shall we say of these
[1:29:56] things
[1:29:57] if god be for us if the promise is for
[1:30:01] us
[1:30:01] who can be against us
[1:30:19] him who never spared his son makila
[1:30:23] but he has given him for us all
[1:30:31] he says with him also freely give us all
[1:30:35] things
[1:30:37] in other words
[1:30:43] because god has already fulfilled what
[1:30:46] he needed with
[1:31:00] uh brighter and all
[1:31:08] um
[1:31:11] to come to the same level with christ
[1:31:15] he says
[1:31:18] it says who shall uh who shall
[1:31:21] who shall accuse the elect of god
[1:31:26] it's god who justifies
[1:31:44] don't worry about what the neighbor is
[1:31:45] going to say
[1:31:48] who will condemn who will lay any charge
[1:31:50] on god's elect
[1:31:51] [Applause]
[1:32:10] who has the power to condemn who has the
[1:32:14] right
[1:32:14] to condemn
[1:32:18] daniela who shall lay any charge kiss
[1:32:22] them all
[1:32:23] christ died and yeah
[1:32:27] he rather uh he says he it's
[1:32:30] it is that resurrected
[1:32:35] and he's at the right hand of god who
[1:32:38] where he's making who who also maketh
[1:32:41] into the intercession for us
[1:32:44] is interceding for us
[1:32:49] when the father looks at us he's looking
[1:32:52] us through christ
[1:32:54] he's looking us through the blood of
[1:32:55] jesus
[1:32:57] and he looks that we are without sin
[1:33:01] because we've been accepted he says
[1:33:06] he says who shall separate us from the
[1:33:08] love of from the love of christ
[1:33:11] shall it be tribulation or the distress
[1:33:16] or persecution
[1:33:19] or uh
[1:33:33] and god is calling us god is calling us
[1:33:41] that we are not supposed to leave like

[1:34:16] lord god almighty
[1:34:20] and god is calling us
[1:34:24] to walk like sons and daughters
[1:34:29] and when this life come to quicken us
[1:34:34] and this when the spirit comes to give
[1:34:36] us the dynamic
[1:34:40] the spirit the scripture says that the
[1:34:41] whole nature is
[1:34:43] is crying on a ton of manifestation
[1:34:47] defeated you looking for the
[1:34:48] manifestation of sons and daughters of
[1:34:50] god
[1:34:52] that nature itself is groaning
[1:34:59] nature is looking waiting for us to take
[1:35:01] the position of christ
[1:35:08] i thought there was a teacher who was
[1:35:10] teaching little kids
[1:35:12] you love he made a description of jesus
[1:35:17] christ that there was a man
[1:35:22] uh you can uh said villains
[1:35:25] you can curse him he's not going to get
[1:35:28] mad
[1:35:30] you can hit him on the right chest he'll
[1:35:32] give you the
[1:35:33] left cheek he was only doing good
[1:35:38] he was living a life of prayer
[1:36:07] young child was looking like this
[1:36:22] and god is calling us to be there
[1:36:25] and to get there
[1:36:28] remarkably look at jesus
[1:36:32] who was without sin and he was praying
[1:36:35] without sin or without ceasing
[1:36:38] it was consecrated look at brother
[1:36:41] branham
[1:36:42] even in the video he was living a life
[1:36:44] of consequences
[1:36:49] and here we are all of us we want the
[1:36:51] same way that god
[1:36:52] used by the random could you lose with
[1:36:53] you that god may use us also
[1:36:57] but are we consecrating ourselves like
[1:36:59] brother and i'm dead
[1:37:04] but are we taking time to meditate the
[1:37:06] word like brother branham did we know
[1:37:08] someone please contact
[1:37:09] us or are we consecrated more to other
[1:37:11] things
[1:37:16] the majority of our times we're doing
[1:37:18] other things
[1:37:21] god wants to bring us to maturity
[1:37:23] maturity
[1:37:25] and that maturity is in our consecration
[1:37:29] that maturity is in the word of god
[1:37:32] the promise
[1:37:58] my brother my sister
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:21] it's because he had known us from before
[1:38:23] the foundation of the world
[1:38:26] if god spoke if god spoke to us tonight
[1:38:31] because he knows that he knows us
[1:38:37] that he took our place
[1:38:40] and his place has been made available
[1:38:45] so that every single one of us will take
[1:38:47] it
[1:38:49] there's enough place for all of us
[1:38:54] and christ is calling us to it
[1:39:07] [Music]
[1:39:09] father through the words that were
[1:39:11] spoken
[1:39:14] you spoke to us
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:20] that before the foundation of the world
[1:39:22] [Music]

[1:39:32] [Music]
[1:39:37] when we heard this message
[1:39:42] [Music]
[1:39:52] and because you justified us
[1:39:55] father through sanctification the
[1:39:58] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:40:00] you're bringing us into adoption to
[1:40:03] glorify us
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:19] [Music]
[1:40:22] the whole being was subject to the word
[1:40:24] god says don't you swallow father like
[1:40:26] in this end times
[1:40:28] you did the same thing through your
[1:40:32] prophet
[1:40:34] we believe that every single one of his
[1:40:36] children
[1:40:38] i believe that every single one of us
[1:40:42] can come forward and claim the promise
[1:40:46] and you that made jesus
[1:41:03] let me quicken the body of my sister
[1:41:06] that it may quicken my body oh let's do
[1:41:08] it at any moment
[1:41:09] let us be in your image let's let that
[1:41:12] arrest some blood

[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:31] we believe that the world will see the
[1:41:33] manifestation of sons and daughters
[1:41:37] we believe that through our lives
[1:41:41] that people around us may be able to see
[1:41:43] you jesus christ
[1:41:54] that wherever we go that they may see
[1:41:56] jesus christ

[1:51:02] change us
[1:51:04] amen
[1:51:08] [Music]
[1:51:15] amen when that a wonderful message
[1:51:20] you know just to share a little light on
[1:51:22] it brother
[1:51:23] paul i thought it was marvelous
[1:51:25] marvelous
[1:51:27] if you caught it tonight you caught the
[1:51:31] difference
[1:51:32] between the quickening of your mortal
[1:51:35] body
[1:51:36] and the change of your mortal
[1:51:40] there are two different things
[1:51:44] we always think quickening and we think
[1:51:46] it's a future event
[1:51:48] instead of realizing it's a present it's
[1:51:51] a present tense event
[1:51:54] amen so if you let that set in your
[1:51:57] heart tonight
[1:51:58] it'll make this message more real to you
[1:52:01] what the prophet
[1:52:02] of god said the quickening power brings
[1:52:04] this
[1:52:05] mortal body into subjection but if this
[1:52:08] body be dissolved we've got one wait for
[1:52:11] it
[1:52:11] what would this body be doing if it
[1:52:13] wasn't for that quickening power god
[1:52:16] forbid we can't even talk about it
[1:52:19] but amen marvelous word of god tonight
[1:52:22] marvelous
[1:52:22] let us just bow our heads together our
[1:52:24] gracious heavenly father

[1:52:35] that had been purchased for us
[1:52:40] and waved over us that we too
[1:52:43] may be quickened and father
[1:52:47] that we too may mature
[1:52:50] and father i believe this body is part
[1:52:54] of that
[1:52:54] great harvest that you've accepted
[1:52:59] and lord i come before you tonight
