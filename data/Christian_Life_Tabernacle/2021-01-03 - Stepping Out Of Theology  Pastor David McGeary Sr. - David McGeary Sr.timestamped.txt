[26:46] Amen good morning Happy New
[26:50] Year I think never was there a more
[26:53] anticipated
[26:55] restart than the see 2021
[26:59] finally come across the calendar you
[27:02] know if you spend any time at all in
[27:04] business or even just in in regular life
[27:07] Corporate America like maybe some of us
[27:09] are in specific
[27:11] Industries at the start of every year
[27:14] there's always this effort to make
[27:16] predictions about what the current year
[27:18] is going to hold right you know either
[27:21] there's some Specialist or some company
[27:23] or some talking head or some article or
[27:27] whatever the case may be that's throwing
[27:29] out you know here's our forecast for the
[27:31] coming year here's our predictions for
[27:33] this year what to expect in
[27:36] 2021 you know often there's an agenda
[27:38] behind it somebody that wants to sell
[27:40] the one thing that's going to help you
[27:41] capitalize on all of those on all of
[27:44] those predictions but you know it's so
[27:48] interesting that even after a year like
[27:49] we've just
[27:50] had the mankind is still flooding
[27:54] everybody's inboxes with predictions
[27:56] what to expect here's our forecast for
[28:00] 2021 how to prepare for the coming year
[28:02] and you know that's that's kind of how
[28:04] it is it's how how man tends to be is to
[28:08] try to put their finger on what the
[28:09] future is going to be and try to
[28:12] anticipate or make preparation for what
[28:14] that is and you know usually as with the
[28:17] case you get to the end of the year and
[28:18] none of those predictions none of those
[28:20] forecasts came true at all you know the
[28:23] year went right when we expected it to
[28:25] go left or some you know disruption
[28:28] showed
[28:29] up you know what it also shows us is We
[28:33] cannot put our trust in the forecasts or
[28:35] the predictions or the view of man but
[28:38] there is a
[28:39] forecast there is a set of predictions
[28:42] that we can put our trust
[28:46] in you know and I would submit to you
[28:48] that we have a
[28:49] forecast for
[28:52] 2021 like to turn to Psalm 93 this
[28:56] morning you know we don't do
[28:58] predictions but we do do
[29:02] promises and if we want to know what
[29:05] 2021 is going to look like maybe we'll
[29:09] sit and look at three
[29:11] promises for
[29:14] 2021 it says in verse one it says the
[29:16] Lord reth he is clothed with Majesty the
[29:19] Lord is clothed with strength wherewith
[29:22] Heath GED himself the world also is
[29:24] established and it cannot be
[29:26] moved you know what's 20 21 is going to
[29:29] look like here's our forecast our first
[29:31] promise is the Lord is on the throne all
[29:34] right and everything is in his control
[29:37] that's a promise that's our forecast for
[29:40] 2021 you know it's interesting it says
[29:42] from verse in verse two it's from
[29:44] Everlasting so not only is it in his
[29:45] control but he's established everything
[29:48] from Everlasting that's your forecast
[29:50] that's your promise for
[29:53] 2021 you want to look at promise number
[29:55] two Another Part Of Your forecast for 20
[29:58] 21 you look in verse three the floods
[30:00] have lifted up oh Lord the floods have
[30:03] lifted up their voice the floods lift up
[30:06] their
[30:07] waves so here's another promise for 2021
[30:10] the floods are going to continue to come
[30:11] against
[30:13] us you know in the scripture a flood is
[30:15] a great pressure right it can thing
[30:19] about a flood is it can shake
[30:21] foundations right it can threaten to
[30:24] wash you away to overwhelm you
[30:28] you know in our in 2021 our forecast is
[30:30] is the floods are going to continue to
[30:32] be there they're going to continue to
[30:34] come against us don't be surprised by it
[30:37] expect it that's our promise that's our
[30:39] forecast for 2021 but we also know that
[30:43] when the enemy will come in like a
[30:45] flood the Lord will raise up a standard
[30:47] against it which takes us to promise
[30:50] number three for 2021 and it's verse
[30:53] four the Lord on high is mightier than
[30:56] the noise of many Waters amen yay then
[30:59] the mighty waves of the sea thy
[31:02] testimonies are very
[31:04] sure Holiness becometh thy house O Lord
[31:09] forever so our forecast for
[31:12] 2021 promise number three is there's
[31:15] going to be a continuing unmovable
[31:19] Fortress against the floods as they
[31:21] raise
[31:22] up it's you know our our this this this
[31:26] this Fortress Is Not Anchored In
[31:27] predictions it's anchored in promises
[31:29] his own promises his testimonies are
[31:34] very sure but here's my favorite part
[31:36] Holiness becometh thine
[31:40] house you know there's a place of
[31:43] Separation there's a place a set aart
[31:45] place which is all Holiness is a set
[31:48] aart place where he
[31:51] dwells and it's an unmovable
[31:54] Fortress and it says that I go to
[31:57] prepare a place for for you that's right
[31:59] that where I am there you may be also
[32:02] present tense so here's your promises
[32:04] here's your forecast for
[32:07] 2021 everything's under his control he's
[32:10] on the throne he's laid it all out from
[32:13] the beginning there's going to continue
[32:15] to be floods that come against us and
[32:18] there's going to continue to be a
[32:19] standard raised against it that's your
[32:21] predictions for
[32:23] 2021 and so if we look at Psalm 20 93
[32:27] and read that this morning it's just a
[32:29] short Psalm but you know I look at that
[32:31] as being I know about you but those are
[32:34] the predictions I'm going to hang on to
[32:36] for
[32:37] 2021 so let's read that together Psalm
[32:40] 93 the Lord reth he is clothed with
[32:43] Majesty the Lord is clothed with
[32:46] strength wherewith he hath GED himself
[32:49] the world also is established that it
[32:51] cannot be moved thy Throne is
[32:53] established of old thou art from
[32:56] Everlasting the flood floods have lifted
[32:58] up oh Lord the floods have lifted up
[33:01] their voice the floods lift up their
[33:03] waves the Lord on high is mightier than
[33:06] the noise of many Waters yay than the
[33:09] mighty waves of the sea thy testimonies
[33:12] are very sure Holiness becometh thine
[33:15] house oh Lord forever

[41:18] this morning amen sister an is a special
[41:22] if she could come at this time and then
[41:24] after that brother goel and you can
[41:26] bring your special
[41:55] amen before I sing the song of I wanted
[41:57] just to share a little bit of my
[41:58] testimony behind this
[42:01] um you know it's easy to sing when
[42:04] things are going well it's easy to
[42:06] praise the Lord but it's a little bit
[42:08] harder when things are not going so
[42:11] great um and in the past four years of
[42:14] my life the Lord has taught me to learn
[42:16] how to praise him through the storm he's
[42:19] taught me to praise him through the
[42:20] storm when my parents' marriage was
[42:22] falling apart when my dad tried to
[42:24] overdose with pain medicine when my
[42:27] siblings went into the world and tested
[42:29] all the things that are not
[42:32] great he uh taught me how to praise him
[42:34] through the storm when my grandmother
[42:36] found out she had cancer when I battled
[42:38] my
[42:40] spiritual when I had my own spiritual
[42:43] battle and what I've learned through the
[42:45] midst of it all is when you learn to
[42:47] push yourself and praise the Lord when
[42:49] it's the hardest to do so even if your
[42:51] lips can't say anything like your soul
[42:54] can and um
[42:57] I realized that the moment that I said
[42:58] God you know what I know you're going to
[43:00] get me through it even when I don't see
[43:02] the Finish Line you're going to give me
[43:04] that Victory to
[43:05] overcome and the the beauty in this song
[43:08] that just it just hits that spot is when
[43:10] it says I'll praise you in the storm and
[43:13] I'll lift my hands for you are who you
[43:15] are no matter where I am every tear I've
[43:18] cried you hold in your hand you've never
[43:20] left my side and though my heart is torn
[43:23] I'll praise you in the storm so I want
[43:25] to praise the Lord today and I if you
[43:27] know the song feel free to join
[43:39] me I was sure by now God you would have
[43:44] reached down and WIP my tears away
[43:49] stepped in and save the day but once
[43:54] again I say Amen
[43:58] and it's still
[44:01] raining and As The Thunder
[44:04] Rolls I barely hear your whisper through
[44:08] the

[1:15:46] it's a great place for you to start with
[1:15:50] anything that you want to do You' got to
[1:15:53] have a starting place so let's make sure
[1:15:55] that it's something that's for the
[1:15:57] kingdom of God certainly enjoyed the
[1:15:59] specials this morning and I I certainly
[1:16:02] see that we've got lots and lots of
[1:16:05] talent you know like I always say you
[1:16:08] know brother Orlando always say to him
[1:16:11] he'll say how you gonna how you going to
[1:16:13] preach behind that or how you going to
[1:16:15] do it well I don't know how we're going
[1:16:16] to do it but we know he'll help us amen
[1:16:20] if you're hungry I'm sure he'll reach
[1:16:22] out and feed your heart this morning so
[1:16:25] let's uh turn in our Bibles this morning
[1:16:30] and um I hope that I can uh bring this
[1:16:34] out I'm going to read some statements
[1:16:37] out of the message um this morning that
[1:16:42] called it's called what it
[1:16:45] takes to overcome all
[1:16:49] unbelief and and then it he says our
[1:16:52] faith but um we want to bring another
[1:16:57] thought out from that uh message that is
[1:17:01] a part of what that um we want to do but
[1:17:06] so we want to read over here in St the
[1:17:09] gospel of St Luke the 4th chapter and
[1:17:13] the
[1:17:14] 14th down through the 18th verse
[1:17:26] we'll we'll read through the 21st verse
[1:17:28] and and
[1:17:33] um I know this scripture is used in
[1:17:36] other messages but we're not taking it
[1:17:40] from uh the the aspect of what most of
[1:17:46] us think when we read this but and Jesus
[1:17:50] returned in the power of the spirit in
[1:17:54] into
[1:17:55] Galilee and there went out a Fame of him
[1:18:02] throughout all the region round about so
[1:18:06] we know the great story in the setting
[1:18:09] here Jesus just came off the great
[1:18:13] Temptation off of the
[1:18:16] mountain and so Satan had offered him to
[1:18:21] do
[1:18:22] everything and give him everything
[1:18:25] everything so that he wouldn't do what
[1:18:27] he was called to do That's what Satan
[1:18:31] didn't want him to do what he's come to
[1:18:34] do okay so he was trying to rob him of
[1:18:39] his
[1:18:40] purpose and so it says it and there went
[1:18:43] out a Fame of him throughout all the
[1:18:46] regions round about and he taught in
[1:18:49] their synagogues being glorified of all
[1:18:55] and he came to
[1:18:57] Nazareth where he had been brought
[1:19:01] up as his custom was he went into the
[1:19:08] synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood
[1:19:12] up for to read and there was delivered
[1:19:16] unto him the book of The Prophet
[1:19:22] Isaias and when he had had opened the
[1:19:26] book he found the place where it was
[1:19:30] written the spirit of the Lord is upon
[1:19:36] me because he hath anointed me to preach
[1:19:41] the gospel to the poor he hath sent me
[1:19:46] to heal the
[1:19:48] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[1:19:51] the captives to recover
[1:19:55] the sight of the Blind and to set at
[1:19:59] Liberty them that are bruised to preach
[1:20:04] the acceptable year of the
[1:20:08] Lord and he closed the book when he gave
[1:20:12] it again to the
[1:20:15] minister and sat
[1:20:17] down and the eyes of all them that were
[1:20:22] in the synagogue
[1:20:24] were fastened on him and he began to say
[1:20:29] unto them this day is this scripture
[1:20:33] fulfilled in your ears amen father we
[1:20:37] ask you to bless your word in your
[1:20:39] precious name we pray
[1:20:42] amen may be
[1:20:53] seated I I believe that great scripture
[1:20:57] is still being fulfilled this
[1:21:01] morning and I I I want to bring this uh
[1:21:08] thought uh to you this morning er um you
[1:21:13] know I I'm not a great evangelist by any
[1:21:16] means but just as a
[1:21:18] pastor that it's necessary many times
[1:21:23] that we set in our heart uh the
[1:21:27] direction that we should go in or that
[1:21:31] we should bring to remembrance to the
[1:21:33] people to consider certain things to
[1:21:37] consider certain thoughts in order to
[1:21:40] examine ourselves to look at ourselves
[1:21:43] to have make sure that we're placed in
[1:21:46] the right place and and so what I wanted
[1:21:51] to minister this morning as a subject or
[1:21:54] a thought
[1:21:55] that we could build to is that uh is
[1:21:59] stepping out of
[1:22:02] theology stepping out of Theology and so
[1:22:06] I i' like to try to share with you this
[1:22:08] morning what that I mean by that because
[1:22:12] we all have things that we believe we we
[1:22:15] we have belief and the purpose of
[1:22:18] theology because we should have sound
[1:22:22] Doctrine and uh so theology has its
[1:22:26] purpose and having a sound Doctrine has
[1:22:29] its purpose because a sound Doctrine
[1:22:32] when you know the truth and you're
[1:22:34] Anchored In God's word it keeps you from
[1:22:37] being lied to and what false Doctrine
[1:22:41] always does is tries to change the
[1:22:44] narrative it tries to draw a picture it
[1:22:47] tries to see draw a a a certain
[1:22:50] Viewpoint and set in your mind a certain
[1:22:54] way of thinking that's why it's very
[1:22:58] difficult for someone who has accepted
[1:23:01] the doctrines of the Trinity and and
[1:23:05] believes that there's three
[1:23:07] Gods ever to really come to a full
[1:23:11] understanding of their relationship with
[1:23:14] the father as a
[1:23:17] son because when he's a presented as a
[1:23:22] trinity he's not presented as anything
[1:23:26] that you can personally identify
[1:23:29] with because you've got God the Father
[1:23:32] you've got God the son you've got God
[1:23:34] the Holy Ghost you've got all these
[1:23:37] things up there and you don't know who
[1:23:38] to pray to and it leaves you ever in a
[1:23:42] state that you will never be able to
[1:23:44] find the fact that you came from the
[1:23:47] mind of God
[1:23:50] yourself that the purpose that he sent
[1:23:53] his son
[1:23:55] was to redeem you and to and to save you
[1:24:00] and that your name was written on the
[1:24:02] Lamb's Book of Life if someone would be
[1:24:06] received the false doctrine that the
[1:24:09] speaking in tongues is the evidence of
[1:24:12] the Holy Ghost then that shuts them down
[1:24:15] to where if they if they don't haven't
[1:24:18] spoken tongues or they have to fake that
[1:24:21] they spoke in tongues and all those
[1:24:24] things it it just throws you out of
[1:24:26] balance for what the real evidence of
[1:24:29] the holy spirit is and you know you have
[1:24:33] the Holy Spirit I'm not talking about
[1:24:35] spiritual anointing when you've met
[1:24:38] Jesus Christ personally the evidence of
[1:24:41] the holy spirit is the Jesus Christ
[1:24:45] revealed to you personally you know him
[1:24:50] you just know him he he's introduced
[1:24:53] himself to you you didn't find him he
[1:24:56] found
[1:24:57] you and you you might have the Theology
[1:25:01] of it of all the things that God is you
[1:25:05] might have the Bible teaching on it but
[1:25:07] when it becomes personal to you and you
[1:25:10] know that you've met him you've stepped
[1:25:13] out of the
[1:25:15] Theology and now you've come to
[1:25:18] something that's real and that's
[1:25:21] personal amen and so we and that's what
[1:25:26] the spirit is and uh I I I believe last
[1:25:30] Sunday our brother did a nice job on on
[1:25:33] on trying to express to us the need for
[1:25:36] the spirit so you could do works and and
[1:25:40] live a life from
[1:25:43] theology but could never have the life
[1:25:46] of the spirit in you and and and that's
[1:25:50] how that he could say depart from me you
[1:25:53] doers of iniquity I never knew you in
[1:25:57] other words I never knew you I've never
[1:25:59] met you I've never talked with you
[1:26:01] you've done everything from just
[1:26:05] Theology and we want to step out of
[1:26:09] Theology and I'm not talking about
[1:26:12] stepping away from sound
[1:26:14] Doctrine I'm I'm talking about something
[1:26:16] that's more personal to you this morning
[1:26:21] so if I could say like as we start this
[1:26:23] year if we could just take a moment and
[1:26:27] have a
[1:26:29] personal
[1:26:31] examination of our life to stand back
[1:26:34] and and see where we're positioned to to
[1:26:38] see what what our pathway is uh to uh
[1:26:44] examine
[1:26:46] ourselves and I think that we realize
[1:26:50] that in this ladyo and age that we live
[1:26:53] in
[1:26:55] that it it it it takes and the believer
[1:26:59] is granted to them that
[1:27:02] overcometh in this blind wretched poor
[1:27:06] miserable naked age that we live in
[1:27:10] where man doesn't even feel they need
[1:27:13] God science has risen to the place and
[1:27:16] education has risen to the place that
[1:27:19] they don't need
[1:27:21] Faith their their trust is in everything
[1:27:25] else now education isn't bad it's fine
[1:27:28] to get education it's it's fine to get a
[1:27:32] degree what's wrong is when you trust in
[1:27:37] it you know that's not where our trust
[1:27:39] is anchored in our trust is anchored in
[1:27:42] the Lord and and where it is so and we
[1:27:47] we realize that there's there's there's
[1:27:51] something that God is looking for
[1:27:54] and and so when we stand back and we
[1:27:57] look at ourselves we we have to have
[1:28:00] this great uh
[1:28:04] uh Revelation if I could say it in our
[1:28:07] heart so I'd like to just read
[1:28:11] uh uh a a couple scriptures here found
[1:28:15] in Luke the 18th
[1:28:21] chapter and he's just given this story
[1:28:24] story about the you know the unjust
[1:28:27] judge and how that the Widow pursued him
[1:28:30] night and day and and uh wouldn't get
[1:28:34] off his back and finally he got so tired
[1:28:37] of her he said here just do it whatever
[1:28:41] you want you know just leave me alone I
[1:28:44] like that I like that persistence but he
[1:28:47] says here in the and the Lord said Luke
[1:28:51] 8 uh 18 and
[1:28:55] six and the Lord said hear what the
[1:28:58] unjust judge said and shall not God
[1:29:03] avenge his own
[1:29:05] elect which cry day and night unto
[1:29:10] him though he bear long with them just
[1:29:15] think of how longsuffering God has been
[1:29:17] to
[1:29:18] us you know and uh and so into the
[1:29:24] picture this morning we have a God
[1:29:27] that's been Longs suffering with us and
[1:29:31] he says and I tell you that he will
[1:29:34] avenge them speedily
[1:29:38] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:29:42] shall he find faith on the earth and so
[1:29:48] we realize that God's not looking for
[1:29:51] theology he's looking for faith
[1:29:55] he's looking for something that is a
[1:29:57] substance within you that believes the
[1:30:02] word of
[1:30:03] God and we want to stretch that out a
[1:30:06] little farther not just believing it in
[1:30:10] the promises but believing in the
[1:30:16] work now we we we realize that uh
[1:30:22] there's there's there there's go now as
[1:30:25] we listen he says now if you want to put
[1:30:28] this on the screen as you go it's from
[1:30:31] the message what it takes to overcome
[1:30:33] all be unbelief a 6 uh
[1:30:37] z uh uh July the 29th
[1:30:42] 1960 in Yakama and I don't know what
[1:30:46] book I got this from but this is a
[1:30:48] paragraph
[1:30:50] e13 and he says this he says now now all
[1:30:54] Redemptive blessings to us the human
[1:30:59] race was paid for us at Calvary when
[1:31:04] Jesus died for
[1:31:06] us now remember what is he looking for
[1:31:10] he's not looking for the
[1:31:12] theology that he died for us he's not
[1:31:16] looking for the teaching that he died
[1:31:19] for us he wants to step out of the
[1:31:22] Theology of it
[1:31:24] or the intellect of it and can get a and
[1:31:28] believe in what that he
[1:31:32] accomplished in other words believe what
[1:31:35] the work
[1:31:37] was because we just read the scripture
[1:31:40] and he says I'm
[1:31:42] anointed I've been
[1:31:44] anointed Amen in other words I've went
[1:31:47] out in the wilderness I've been baptized
[1:31:50] I received the Holy Spirit I've come
[1:31:53] back filled with the Holy Ghost Jesus
[1:31:57] asked them can you be baptized with the
[1:31:59] baptism wherein I was baptized
[1:32:03] with now we're talking about
[1:32:07] faith not
[1:32:09] theology theology is he went and got
[1:32:12] baptized theology is he did this
[1:32:15] theology is did that theology's woven
[1:32:18] with history but the question is do you
[1:32:21] believe
[1:32:24] that you can be baptized with the same
[1:32:28] baptism that he was baptized
[1:32:32] with and I honestly feel that that was
[1:32:36] the
[1:32:38] purpose that our messenger came back to
[1:32:42] this church that was lost in
[1:32:46] darkness to let them know that they
[1:32:48] could have the same baptism that he was
[1:32:52] baptized with
[1:32:54] so look let's just listen closely as we
[1:32:57] read
[1:32:58] this we believe that the that the
[1:33:02] work and the complete plan of God in
[1:33:06] every Redemptive blessing was completed
[1:33:10] at
[1:33:11] Calvary that all of God's promises was
[1:33:15] made possible to every
[1:33:19] human being that would accept it
[1:33:27] okay now you understand what I'm talking
[1:33:30] about when you step out of the theology
[1:33:32] yeah yeah you get that
[1:33:35] Spirit something's going to
[1:33:38] trans
[1:33:40] happen so we've got to take it out of
[1:33:43] theology step out of Theology and bring
[1:33:47] it into
[1:33:49] reality when Jesus died to clear
[1:33:53] that human before God at
[1:33:58] Calvary so he cleared the
[1:34:02] board now if you believe that you've got
[1:34:05] to clear the
[1:34:07] board I believe that every man in the
[1:34:11] world was saved when Jesus died at
[1:34:15] Calvary every sick person in the world
[1:34:17] was healed when Jesus died at
[1:34:21] Calvary but now
[1:34:24] it's a finished
[1:34:26] work now the thing to
[1:34:31] do is can we get the people to see it
[1:34:37] and accept
[1:34:40] it when you step out of the
[1:34:44] Theology and you see it then you accept
[1:34:47] it it's not something that you
[1:34:51] believe come on it becomes a reality and
[1:34:55] a possession yes sir I'm you know when
[1:34:59] you say I'm redeemed well you can't say
[1:35:02] I'm redeemed and carry on all kinds of
[1:35:04] guilt of all your sins if you've
[1:35:07] confessed your sins he's rightful he's
[1:35:10] just and faithful to forgive him now if
[1:35:14] you believe that you have to step out of
[1:35:17] the theology that he died at Calvary and
[1:35:20] step into the reality of acceptance
[1:35:26] amen Lord help us as we go
[1:35:31] further therefore Divine Healing doesn't
[1:35:35] lay upon some magic
[1:35:38] something that someone has in their
[1:35:42] hands or some holy oil or water that
[1:35:47] they sprinkle on the
[1:35:49] people I do not believe in those things
[1:35:53] I believe that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:35:56] is sufficient for everything we have
[1:35:59] need of see I believe it's
[1:36:03] something has already been paid
[1:36:09] for
[1:36:11] so
[1:36:13] we we understand that there's a finished
[1:36:18] work and and a as we realize that great
[1:36:22] finished work and we realize that that
[1:36:26] God's looking for
[1:36:28] Faith but he's also said these things if
[1:36:32] we would look in St John the 14th CH uh
[1:36:36] chapter of St John in the 12th
[1:36:41] verse let's read in St John 10 uh 36
[1:36:47] first
[1:37:16] let's try let's just let's start with
[1:37:18] the 33rd verse of St John 10
[1:37:25] and Jesus answered him saying for a good
[1:37:30] work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy
[1:37:35] because that thou being a man makest
[1:37:39] thyself
[1:37:41] God and Jesus answered them is it not
[1:37:45] written in your
[1:37:47] law I say ye are gods
[1:37:54] now what's he looking for when he comes
[1:37:58] he's not looking for
[1:38:00] theology he's looking for Faith he's not
[1:38:03] looking for an intellectual
[1:38:06] explanation of that statement he's
[1:38:09] looking for people that have the faith
[1:38:12] to possess
[1:38:15] it like he said I forgive
[1:38:17] you and you say oh Lord I'm so sorry he
[1:38:20] says I forgive you oh I'm so sorry I
[1:38:23] can't believe in it you I've done those
[1:38:25] things I forgive
[1:38:27] you it's in the sea of God's
[1:38:30] forgetfulness well you can believe that
[1:38:33] he's forgiven you of your sins in
[1:38:39] theology come on preacher but if you
[1:38:42] accept your
[1:38:44] pardon then you walk out of the
[1:38:49] prison and condemnation is a prison of
[1:38:56] Satan that's why he came he said I come
[1:38:58] to re to bind up the Brokenhearted to
[1:39:02] set the captives those that have been
[1:39:04] bruised yeah and there's the sins
[1:39:08] bruised your lives yes sir and none of
[1:39:11] us have a past that we really want to
[1:39:14] explain you know nobody ever gives you
[1:39:16] details and don't give the details of
[1:39:19] your testimony yes sir you were a sinner
[1:39:23] we get the picture amen you know if you
[1:39:26] just want to describe the sin and
[1:39:28] describe how drunk you were or how loose
[1:39:31] you morally and all the then you're
[1:39:34] still reveling in those
[1:39:37] things but that's what he takes away
[1:39:39] from us he takes away the shame of it he
[1:39:42] takes away the condemnation of it so we
[1:39:45] can say I
[1:39:47] was
[1:39:49] amen but I died to that Hallelujah and
[1:39:53] that man is buried and I'm resurrected
[1:39:55] in the Lord
[1:39:57] Jesus um he says ye are Gods if he
[1:40:03] called them
[1:40:05] Gods unto whom the word of the Lord
[1:40:09] came and the scriptures cannot be broken
[1:40:13] EXA say ye of him whom the father hath
[1:40:18] Sanctified and sent unto the world th
[1:40:24] blasphemeth because I say I am the Son
[1:40:28] of
[1:40:31] God all that believed on him he gave
[1:40:34] them the power to become the Sons and
[1:40:38] Daughters of
[1:40:39] God I mean when when do we step out of
[1:40:43] the theology into the reality that we
[1:40:47] are Sons and Daughters of
[1:40:50] God we're not in this world we're not of
[1:40:53] this world and we shouldn't be partaking
[1:40:56] of the world in the styles of the world
[1:40:59] or or anything in the world you know I I
[1:41:02] Marvel sometimes at the singing in the
[1:41:05] world today Christian songs that if you
[1:41:08] research it a little bit you're going to
[1:41:10] take it back to the style of some
[1:41:14] worldly
[1:41:16] [Music]
[1:41:18] singer the same beat the same uh feel
[1:41:23] uh you know just those things it's not
[1:41:27] important brother go
[1:41:29] ahead well thank you anyway uh and and
[1:41:34] and it's
[1:41:34] driven I went to a bookstore over here
[1:41:38] uh where they used to have a big church
[1:41:40] you a big bookstore and I went in the
[1:41:42] bookstore and then there was a shelf he
[1:41:44] said if you like Dolly
[1:41:47] Parton you will like this musician this
[1:41:50] musician and this musician
[1:41:54] if you like Jimmy lafaya or whatever the
[1:41:58] guy's name was you'll like this and L I
[1:42:01] looked up and down couldn't find
[1:42:02] anything about you know if you're a
[1:42:06] Christian or if you're born again or if
[1:42:09] you're filled with the Holy Ghost it's
[1:42:12] always relating back to
[1:42:15] Talent relating back to style and those
[1:42:19] things and and I I'll tell you I like
[1:42:23] heartfelt
[1:42:25] music the the song the sister sonng the
[1:42:28] first time I heard that song it bound
[1:42:29] with my heart and I know what that
[1:42:33] song's
[1:42:34] about you know I I never want to be
[1:42:37] caught up into the style or the music or
[1:42:40] the beat but I want to be able to
[1:42:43] connect with the words okay and that's
[1:42:46] why when you you step out of theology
[1:42:49] you step into the reality in other words
[1:42:52] I'm singing about what I know I'm
[1:42:55] singing about somebody who I've met I'm
[1:42:59] not bringing you the beat I'm not
[1:43:00] bringing you the tone I'm not bringing
[1:43:03] you the Rhythm I'm bringing you the god
[1:43:06] that's supposed to be in the
[1:43:09] song and there's a bunch of Christian
[1:43:12] music today there ain't no God in
[1:43:14] it the theology is
[1:43:21] there but there's not the life
[1:43:23] experience behind it there there's not
[1:43:27] the suffering behind it they like it cuz
[1:43:29] they like the song they like the beat
[1:43:32] they like the words they like the artist
[1:43:34] that did it but but they've never been
[1:43:37] into that place in in that hidden
[1:43:42] chamber where that song was
[1:43:48] birthed so you start to understand what
[1:43:51] I'm talking about about stepping out of
[1:43:54] the
[1:43:55] Theology of it amen of the
[1:43:58] Christianity can I take my coat off I
[1:44:02] don't know I'm burning
[1:44:04] up amen and I'm trying to stay
[1:44:08] calm trying to be the new
[1:44:14] me so
[1:44:17] uh so we were reading
[1:44:20] uh and he said
[1:44:24] that I that I'm the Son of God if I do
[1:44:28] not the works of my father believe me
[1:44:33] not act and this is what we're going to
[1:44:36] just Fellowship a little bit about Jesus
[1:44:40] was
[1:44:41] anointed to do a
[1:44:45] work his his anointing is upon me to do
[1:44:51] this to do that to carry out these
[1:44:57] things so what I'm saying is you can
[1:45:00] stay in the
[1:45:02] Theology and never get in the
[1:45:07] work we've got to step out of the
[1:45:10] theology into the
[1:45:13] work amen okay that could this this is
[1:45:16] very important to me as a
[1:45:19] pastor that if I don't do anything else
[1:45:22] at least I tell you and show it to you
[1:45:27] in the word of
[1:45:31] God all let's just finish the scripture
[1:45:35] we'll go
[1:45:40] forward if I do not the works of my
[1:45:43] father believe me not but if I
[1:45:49] do thou though ye believe not me believe
[1:45:54] the
[1:45:55] works that ye may know and believe that
[1:45:59] the father is in me and I in
[1:46:08] him therefore they sought again to take
[1:46:11] him but he escaped out of their mid it
[1:46:16] it when he when he finally comes down
[1:46:21] and and he says if I do not the works of
[1:46:25] my father Believe Me Not So when it it
[1:46:29] came down it didn't
[1:46:32] matter what the theology was
[1:46:37] right because
[1:46:39] theology without
[1:46:42] works is
[1:46:46] dead and that's what Paul said show me
[1:46:49] your theology without your works and
[1:46:52] I'll show you my theology by my works so
[1:46:56] if we step out of the theology out of
[1:47:00] the teaching and realize that the reason
[1:47:05] that the spirit was given to
[1:47:09] us was to do the
[1:47:13] work that's right and let me say we
[1:47:16] preach
[1:47:18] it that the spirit was given to us to
[1:47:21] believe the the
[1:47:26] ology am we
[1:47:29] do I mean I Heard lots of
[1:47:32] preaching if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:47:35] you'll believe this believe that you'll
[1:47:38] believe you'll believe Malachi 4:5
[1:47:40] you'll believe the opening of the seals
[1:47:42] you be but that's not what the spirit
[1:47:45] was given
[1:47:49] for the spirit was given
[1:47:53] to do the
[1:47:55] work isn't that what he comissioned us
[1:47:59] to do was to go into all the world and
[1:48:02] preach the gospel and the these signs
[1:48:06] shall follow them that believe they
[1:48:08] shall lay hands on the sick they shall
[1:48:10] do this work they should do that work
[1:48:12] they could do this work and then he said
[1:48:15] to them he said but go Terry
[1:48:19] first until you're endued with power
[1:48:23] from on
[1:48:27] high because you can't do his work until
[1:48:31] you have his
[1:48:33] Spirit to do his
[1:48:38] work just
[1:48:40] just just think of
[1:48:43] that he we we know what his work is cuz
[1:48:47] he purchased it for
[1:48:51] us and that's what he he said he he said
[1:48:54] this let's just take that for a moment
[1:48:57] paragraph uh 20 of the same message now
[1:49:02] the scripture said Jesus said himself in
[1:49:06] John
[1:49:07] 14:7 he that heareth my
[1:49:11] words no The Works that I
[1:49:16] do that he believeth on me the works
[1:49:21] that I do shall shall he do
[1:49:25] also so he that believeth on me the
[1:49:29] works that I do he'll do also so he's
[1:49:33] come back to look for
[1:49:37] faith not
[1:49:39] theology right he's looking for the
[1:49:43] faith because he that
[1:49:45] believes does the
[1:49:50] work so that that's why you know them by
[1:49:54] their
[1:49:55] fruits not by their
[1:49:59] theology so the very fact he says that
[1:50:03] he that believeth on
[1:50:05] me why don't we just read that there for
[1:50:09] a moment in St John 14
[1:50:33] did I get that uh right there I
[1:50:38] thought verse
[1:50:40] 12 so after he had finished washing
[1:50:43] their feet and taking His Garment he
[1:50:45] said you know what
[1:50:46] I you what I have done to you
[1:50:54] oh I'm in 13 okay thank you I knew
[1:50:56] something was wrong I you you're going
[1:50:58] to have to bear with me I'm getting
[1:51:01] older anybody identify with that not in
[1:51:04] here right okay okay John 14 and yes
[1:51:09] okay so he says if you had known me you
[1:51:13] would have known my father
[1:51:17] also and from hence forth ye know him
[1:51:21] and have seen him
[1:51:23] Philip S the Lord show us the father and
[1:51:26] it survice us Jesus said un to
[1:51:31] him have I been with you so long a
[1:51:34] time with you and yet hast thou not
[1:51:38] known
[1:51:40] me he hath seen me hath seen the father
[1:51:46] and the father and and and how sayth
[1:51:52] thou show us the father believest thou
[1:51:55] that I am in the father and the father
[1:51:59] in me and the words that I speak unto
[1:52:03] you I speak not of myself but of the
[1:52:06] father that dwelleth in me he doth The
[1:52:14] Works Jesus did not teach
[1:52:18] theology he taught
[1:52:21] works yeah I'm not talking about Church
[1:52:23] of Christ works or or calvinist Works he
[1:52:28] talk taught about being about the
[1:52:31] father's
[1:52:36] business believe me that I am in the
[1:52:40] father and the father in me or else
[1:52:42] believe me for the
[1:52:44] very Works
[1:52:47] sake he never wanted us to try to Anchor
[1:52:52] people in our Doctrine and our Theology
[1:52:55] and not have a real genuine life that
[1:53:00] was manifesting what you
[1:53:05] believe like you don't believe the
[1:53:07] Lord's coming soon and have nothing in
[1:53:11] your life that shows you're looking for
[1:53:15] him verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:53:19] believeth on
[1:53:21] me the word works that I do shall he do
[1:53:26] also and Greater Works than
[1:53:31] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:53:36] father and what soever you shall ask in
[1:53:39] my name that I will do and the father
[1:53:42] may be glorified in the son and if you
[1:53:45] shall ask anything in my name I will do
[1:53:48] it if you love me you will keep my
[1:53:52] command
[1:53:53] Commandments and so that that's the
[1:53:55] scripture and he says now greater back
[1:53:58] to our quote the English translation
[1:54:00] says greater than this shall he do for I
[1:54:04] go to my father but if you take the
[1:54:07] original translation that it says more
[1:54:11] shall he
[1:54:12] do now more shall you do now let's begin
[1:54:16] to listen as we just go through the
[1:54:18] Sunday School lesson now no one could do
[1:54:22] great than he
[1:54:24] did because he raised the
[1:54:27] dead he stopped nature and just done
[1:54:32] everything but
[1:54:35] what it said was that he said a little
[1:54:40] while and the world shall see me no
[1:54:43] more more now that the word is Cosmos
[1:54:48] which means the world order so the word
[1:54:52] World won't see him it shall see me no
[1:54:55] more yet ye his church shall see me for
[1:55:02] I is a personal pronoun and we know that
[1:55:06] I will be with
[1:55:10] you he's even said and in you until the
[1:55:16] end of the world now what is it then
[1:55:23] God could manifest himself through one
[1:55:27] man a man his son called Jesus now God
[1:55:32] takes the spirit of
[1:55:35] Jesus and puts it back upon his children
[1:55:40] that's been adopted by Jesus Christ and
[1:55:44] manifest The Same Spirit the same
[1:55:48] power the world around that God in us
[1:55:53] Emmanuel in us we've been cleansed by
[1:55:58] the blood of Jesus and I do believe in
[1:56:01] pure absolute Holy Ghost religion and
[1:56:06] Holiness I believe that a man cleaned up
[1:56:10] from a life of sin quits all of his
[1:56:13] drinking lying stealing and everything
[1:56:16] else I believe he lives for
[1:56:20] God because the spirit in him is God's
[1:56:25] spirit and that Spirit leads him and
[1:56:29] guides him into righteousness and
[1:56:32] Holiness that God could live in him and
[1:56:37] will do his will in
[1:56:42] him so he God can only do his Works in
[1:56:47] one
[1:56:48] man so he sent the spirit back
[1:56:53] that the works that I do shall you do
[1:56:59] also so you can't do his
[1:57:04] work without his spirit
[1:57:08] amen I mean that's just that's just what
[1:57:14] it takes so he can't and and this is
[1:57:19] what in our day we we know that the
[1:57:23] prophet of God was sent and God sent a
[1:57:26] message to his church to restore back
[1:57:29] the Faith of Our
[1:57:32] Fathers not the
[1:57:35] Theology of our
[1:57:40] fathers not just to get the godhead
[1:57:42] teaching right the evidence of the Holy
[1:57:45] Spirit right Holiness dressing
[1:57:48] right we we begin to anchor on that
[1:57:53] and then we begin to Anchor in the
[1:57:57] Theology of the Fulfillment of Malachi
[1:58:02] 4 Luke
[1:58:04] 17:30 and Revelations
[1:58:08] 10:7 and when you do that you end up
[1:58:12] becoming a denomination like any other
[1:58:17] denomination yes sir you become a single
[1:58:25] organization within
[1:58:28] yourself because now you've anchored in
[1:58:31] the
[1:58:32] theology now it's what your Doctrine is
[1:58:35] it's what you believe what your uh dress
[1:58:39] code is what your church code is you you
[1:58:42] you've rested and you've anchored in the
[1:58:50] teachings and now you enter into the
[1:58:52] Battle of
[1:58:55] comparing my doctrines and teachings are
[1:58:58] more sound than your doctrines and
[1:59:02] teachings but Paul said I never came
[1:59:04] unto you with enticing
[1:59:08] words but I came unto you with the power
[1:59:12] and the demonstration of the
[1:59:15] spirit he was saying if you can't
[1:59:18] believe me for what I'm teaching believe
[1:59:20] me for my works
[1:59:24] amen step out of the theology for a
[1:59:27] moment and see God moving in
[1:59:32] [Applause]
[1:59:45] reality and he said a little while the
[1:59:48] world will see me no more but use Cosmos
[1:59:51] world's Cosmos
[1:59:52] I'll be with you he said
[1:59:57] even in you until the end of the world
[2:00:00] now what was it then God could not
[2:00:03] manifest him he could manifest him
[2:00:05] through self through one
[2:00:08] man a man his son called Jesus now God
[2:00:13] takes the spirit of that Jesus and puts
[2:00:17] it back on his
[2:00:19] children amen so he he the the spirit is
[2:00:26] given for a
[2:00:29] purpose in other words he can't restore
[2:00:32] the faith without restoring the
[2:00:36] works that's
[2:00:39] right because the faith was
[2:00:44] given for the
[2:00:50] works that's why he gave it that's why
[2:00:53] he sent his
[2:00:56] Spirit we're treating the spirit like
[2:00:58] it's foreign
[2:01:03] aid you know what I mean like it's our
[2:01:06] it's our own
[2:01:08] uh it's it's our own personal care
[2:01:14] package I've got the spirit for when I
[2:01:17] need something I've got the spirit when
[2:01:20] I need to go grab a pro promise I want
[2:01:23] Faith so I can get this and I can get
[2:01:26] this and I can solve this and I can have
[2:01:31] this and and we leave
[2:01:36] out yeah that that's our
[2:01:40] theology that we can believe every
[2:01:43] promise of God every promise is the book
[2:01:46] is there every chapter every verse every
[2:01:49] line that's our theology but when do we
[2:01:52] step out of that
[2:01:58] Theology and the have the spirit of God
[2:02:03] that we've been baptized with not just
[2:02:07] there working on our
[2:02:09] behalf but we go out and now enter into
[2:02:13] the labor of being about the father's
[2:02:20] business now let's really look at
[2:02:25] ourselves we've
[2:02:27] sat in the presence of this
[2:02:32] message under the anointing of the
[2:02:35] Prophet messenger because my sheep know
[2:02:38] my
[2:02:40] voice and when I need to pray the Refuge
[2:02:43] I lay down and put on a
[2:02:47] tape but every now and then you put on
[2:02:49] one of those tapes and it starts talking
[2:02:51] to you
[2:02:56] you're stepping out of the theology that
[2:02:58] this is a prophet you're stepping out of
[2:03:01] the theology I believe him I like his
[2:03:06] voice and it starts crying back at
[2:03:11] you what have you
[2:03:16] done when I think of brother man
[2:03:18] preaching that message standing in the
[2:03:20] Gap he says what have I done I've done
[2:03:23] nothing I got to get about my father's
[2:03:26] business and I thought oh man brother
[2:03:28] brandom I'm pretty happy here riding on
[2:03:31] your coat
[2:03:33] tail I've judged myself in only because
[2:03:38] I've judged everybody else
[2:03:42] out and that's not what he's looking for
[2:03:45] he's not looking for theology he's
[2:03:47] looking for a
[2:03:50] faith that
[2:03:52] believes the
[2:03:56] word enough that it does the
[2:04:01] works yes sir a lot of us don't have
[2:04:06] anything at
[2:04:08] all we're doing for the kingdom of
[2:04:16] God
[2:04:20] and let's just read
[2:04:25] read he said but take the original trans
[2:04:29] says more shall he do now no one could
[2:04:32] do greater than he did we read that I
[2:04:35] believe and then he says what he says
[2:04:38] it's Emmanuel in
[2:04:40] us and
[2:04:42] now we have been cleansed by the blood
[2:04:45] of Jesus and I do believe in pure
[2:04:49] absolute Holy Ghost religion
[2:04:52] drinking lying stealing everything else
[2:04:55] I believe in that and that the spirit
[2:04:57] leads him and guides him into all
[2:05:00] righteousness and Holiness that God
[2:05:03] could live in him and will do his will
[2:05:09] in
[2:05:11] him so he sends a spirit to do his will
[2:05:17] or if I could say this to
[2:05:20] continue the work work of Jesus
[2:05:24] Christ because that was the the
[2:05:28] commission he said go into all the world
[2:05:30] do these things things that I do the
[2:05:33] works that I do you should do also but
[2:05:35] go carry into the upper room and wait
[2:05:39] till you get the spirit and you're
[2:05:42] endued with power from on high to do the
[2:05:50] work we it's like we're all still I I
[2:05:53] use these terms but I don't mean it
[2:05:56] personal but it's like staying in the
[2:05:58] upper
[2:06:01] room with the pillar of fire and the
[2:06:08] anointing that's the theology yeah but
[2:06:11] when you step out to Theology and you
[2:06:14] step into the work yeah amen
[2:06:21] let's just drop
[2:06:23] down he says and when the son of 22nd he
[2:06:27] says and when the Son of God God once
[2:06:29] lived in the pillar of fire led the
[2:06:32] children of
[2:06:33] Israel then he come down and lived in a
[2:06:38] man his own son a created
[2:06:43] body then he got a little closer to
[2:06:48] us so when he came down to live he was a
[2:06:51] little closer to
[2:06:53] us then he had to sanctify that body to
[2:06:57] break that virgin born blood cell to
[2:07:01] cleanse the church that he might live in
[2:07:04] everybody's heart that would accept that
[2:07:09] blood for a cleansing Paul says so that
[2:07:13] he could come into their hearts by the
[2:07:17] Holy Spirit then that God
[2:07:22] God
[2:07:24] working in
[2:07:29] us we we receive the spirit
[2:07:32] like and we teach it so much this way
[2:07:36] that I've got the spirit I'm sealed
[2:07:38] under the day of my Redemption that's
[2:07:41] all I need to
[2:07:45] do do you have the spirit are you
[2:07:48] baptized in the
[2:07:49] spirit and are answerers we stopped
[2:07:53] there because that's our theology yeah
[2:07:57] but the he didn't send the
[2:08:00] spirit we just to seal a in we were
[2:08:05] sealed before the foundation of the
[2:08:07] world with our name wrote on the book of
[2:08:10] life he sent his spirit so you could
[2:08:13] continue the work
[2:08:27] so we understand that we've we we've got
[2:08:30] to have we we've got to have the great
[2:08:35] that great move of that spirit in our
[2:08:38] hearts and lives that he he when he came
[2:08:42] to restore the faith he didn't come to
[2:08:45] restore the
[2:08:47] theology he came to restore the works
[2:08:51] yeah
[2:08:59] he
[2:09:00] says he said sin is
[2:09:06] unbelief I said sin is
[2:09:10] unbelief you do those things because you
[2:09:13] believe
[2:09:15] not and that believer Believers on the
[2:09:19] Lord won't do those things he's passed
[2:09:22] from death and to life but you
[2:09:27] understand what Sin is Sin is
[2:09:30] unbelief so do you believe that you're
[2:09:35] sent into the
[2:09:37] world do you believe these signs shall
[2:09:41] follow amen do you believe the works
[2:09:44] that I do you shall do
[2:09:48] also that was the promise to the church
[2:09:54] but that's what nicadan ISM
[2:09:56] did nickol adism come and took that away
[2:10:00] from the people and put it on a select
[2:10:04] group of
[2:10:06] men they're anointed to do the work they
[2:10:10] lay hands on their sit they're they're
[2:10:14] the
[2:10:15] uh they're The
[2:10:18] Chosen right no
[2:10:22] the spirit was given to do the
[2:10:32] works that's what he
[2:10:35] said I'll be with you even in you till
[2:10:38] the
[2:10:39] end the works that I do you shall do
[2:10:42] also why because I go unto the father
[2:10:46] and I send you back the comforter
[2:10:52] and and we follow the will of the father
[2:10:57] so the first thing that he he comes he
[2:11:01] robs that from the
[2:11:04] people and now they a they're happy with
[2:11:08] the
[2:11:12] theology well our pastor prays for the
[2:11:17] sick our church prays for the sick
[2:11:22] we had an altar
[2:11:26] call and that all that is is staying in
[2:11:30] your
[2:11:31] theology but when you step out of the
[2:11:34] Theology and you realize that the work
[2:11:39] to lay hands and pray for the sick is
[2:11:41] your
[2:11:44] possession it's not the
[2:11:49] theology or the the mental
[2:11:53] understanding it's the reality of the
[2:11:56] possession that I've been called I've
[2:12:00] been anointed I've been chosen to do
[2:12:04] these works and the spirit that I have
[2:12:07] has been given to
[2:12:11] me you have
[2:12:14] not because you ask not and you ask not
[2:12:19] because you believe not
[2:12:23] do you believe this morning you have the
[2:12:26] Holy
[2:12:28] Spirit then if you have that
[2:12:32] spirit that Spirit was
[2:12:35] given to restore the
[2:12:38] faith but again faith
[2:12:43] without can't restore the faith without
[2:12:47] restoring the works
[2:12:52] because the faith was given to do the
[2:12:56] works so you don't really believe if you
[2:13:00] don't believe that you by the
[2:13:04] spirit not by your will not by your the
[2:13:08] theology but by the spirit that you
[2:13:14] received from the
[2:13:18] father that anointed you
[2:13:22] to do the same Works to be a
[2:13:26] continuation and that's what Jesus says
[2:13:28] I'm anointed I'm not anointed to be
[2:13:32] anointed I'm anointed to do the work
[2:13:36] amen so you understand
[2:13:41] unbelief can
[2:13:44] go
[2:13:47] beyond not
[2:13:49] just smoking drinking and those things
[2:13:53] we can do those things by
[2:13:56] theology
[2:13:57] amen but do we believe that we receed
[2:14:01] this spirit for a
[2:14:05] purpose not just to get in the upper
[2:14:08] room and be
[2:14:11] blessed but that he has
[2:14:15] something that he wants to accomplish in
[2:14:19] US
[2:14:24] and that we so whosoever is born of God
[2:14:28] overcometh the world and this is our
[2:14:31] victory that overcometh the world even
[2:14:34] our
[2:14:36] faith now there's a there's a
[2:14:39] purpose
[2:14:41] that beats down in my
[2:14:45] heart because so many
[2:14:48] people they believe
[2:14:53] but they they they don't
[2:14:58] overcome the same things bother them day
[2:15:01] in and day out their Life's a struggle
[2:15:04] with the same
[2:15:06] things they be like being delivered from
[2:15:09] smoking which I believe God
[2:15:12] does and then every time you smelt the
[2:15:15] cigarette
[2:15:21] you know you
[2:15:22] staggered and until you composed
[2:15:25] yourself
[2:15:29] again now you may be able to do that by
[2:15:32] your
[2:15:35] theology but there's an
[2:15:38] overcoming power that you can rise above
[2:15:43] that
[2:15:47] right I I guess that I I've got to
[2:15:50] preach the gospel forgive me but I I I
[2:15:53] guess the probably the hardest thing for
[2:15:55] young men and young or men in this day
[2:16:00] is the lust of the
[2:16:02] Flesh and you can labor and fight that
[2:16:05] and it drains and pull you but there is
[2:16:08] a way to
[2:16:13] overcome and I believe that's what uh
[2:16:17] we're talking about what it takes to
[2:16:20] overcome all
[2:16:22] [Music]
[2:16:26] unbelief and when we can begin to
[2:16:30] understand that part of our ability to
[2:16:35] overcome is by doing the works of the
[2:16:40] father if not all you're battling with
[2:16:43] is your
[2:16:47] theology you're trying to battle a
[2:16:50] spirit
[2:16:51] with what you
[2:16:54] believe my theology says I shouldn't be
[2:16:59] like this my theology teaches this my
[2:17:03] theology teaches that but yet we still
[2:17:07] labor and
[2:17:13] struggle Under The
[2:17:17] Temptations and I know he'll be tempted
[2:17:21] but there's a lot of difference having
[2:17:23] that Wellspring of Life bubbling up
[2:17:28] same
[2:17:31] nay instead of being on your bed going
[2:17:34] oh God I just want to overcome so bad I
[2:17:37] want to be so
[2:17:41] different and we believe in
[2:17:46] defeat and I'm trying to say this
[2:17:49] morning that the there's a way to rise
[2:17:57] up not saying you don't have the spirit
[2:18:00] but I I think it's a lack of
[2:18:03] understanding what the spirit was given
[2:18:06] to us
[2:18:10] for like I said it's not a care
[2:18:14] package it's something that's given to
[2:18:16] you to be about your father's business
[2:18:21] let's just
[2:18:23] read if we could just go to
[2:18:32] paragraph
[2:18:35] 52 I'm sorry I'm long this morning but
[2:18:38] we'll let I'll get through
[2:18:40] this right after that or
[2:18:44] before that previously to that he gave
[2:18:48] the great 11th chapter of HEB Hebrews
[2:18:52] which gave us the Heroes of Faith by
[2:18:55] faith Moses by faith Abraham by faith
[2:18:57] Enoch by faith Noah all the great Heroes
[2:19:01] of
[2:19:02] Faith then saying seeing that we are
[2:19:07] compassed about with such a great cloud
[2:19:10] of witness let us lay aside every
[2:19:14] weight and the
[2:19:17] sin the unbelief
[2:19:20] that do so easily beset
[2:19:24] us let us set aside those things that
[2:19:28] are keeping us from doing the works yes
[2:19:32] sir here we are tonight right in the
[2:19:36] shadows of the coming of the Son of God
[2:19:40] and yet we find the church is an nemic
[2:19:44] condition we ought to be
[2:19:48] great strong Mighty Warriors of faith
[2:19:54] that would shake the
[2:19:56] nation God give it to us we we we would
[2:20:02] just receive it so there's little things
[2:20:07] upon us that holds us back from
[2:20:15] running can you understand so there's
[2:20:18] something that's holding us back
[2:20:21] from being about the father's
[2:20:25] business doing the works that we were
[2:20:28] commissioned to do
[2:20:31] amen now I'm not on a search today to
[2:20:34] try to ring the
[2:20:39] bell but that's what I'm talking about
[2:20:42] this
[2:20:43] morning
[2:20:45] is the first thing the spirit does is
[2:20:48] convicts us of what
[2:20:53] unbelief what is it that's holding you
[2:20:56] back from doing the
[2:21:01] work now remember when the
[2:21:04] scripture when Jesus
[2:21:06] came and the goat and separated the
[2:21:09] goats and
[2:21:11] sheep remember that the
[2:21:14] scripture he said when I was
[2:21:18] hungry you fed me
[2:21:23] when I didn't have clothing you clothed
[2:21:25] me when I was thirsty you gave me
[2:21:30] drink everything that the father judged
[2:21:33] them by not one of them was what their
[2:21:36] theology
[2:21:40] was it was they were judged by their
[2:21:43] life's
[2:21:48] work and and if we not
[2:21:52] careful we've anchored in our
[2:21:57] theology that what we believe is
[2:22:00] right and we fail to understand that
[2:22:03] it's not our theology our theology Keeps
[2:22:07] Us
[2:22:09] straight keeps us from being
[2:22:11] deceived keeps us to having a false
[2:22:15] understanding of God and who he is and
[2:22:18] what his purpose is
[2:22:20] but the spirit is upon us that we do the
[2:22:26] works that we feed
[2:22:29] the
[2:22:32] poor and we we we brought that to a
[2:22:36] spiritual type last Sunday
[2:22:39] yeah how about giving somebody a drink
[2:22:43] of the grace of the water of living
[2:22:46] Fountain how about the meat of the word
[2:22:48] of God
[2:22:50] how about visiting those that are in
[2:22:53] prison those that are captivated by
[2:22:56] drugs and addictions and things like
[2:23:01] that
[2:23:03] amen that holds us back from running let
[2:23:07] us lay aside all those little weights
[2:23:10] now because we're looking to the author
[2:23:13] and finisher of our faith Jesus Christ
[2:23:17] who was made man on Earth and DS Among
[2:23:21] Us and was made sin that through his
[2:23:25] righteousness we might be forgiven of
[2:23:28] our
[2:23:30] sins he became us sinners that we might
[2:23:36] become his
[2:23:38] righteousness in other words like this
[2:23:42] he became me that I might become
[2:23:49] him well
[2:23:52] what was
[2:23:54] he come on
[2:23:56] pre if you don't believe me for what I'm
[2:23:58] teaching you believe me for my
[2:24:02] Works believe me for the life you
[2:24:05] understand what I'm trying to say we got
[2:24:06] to step out of the theology grab the
[2:24:09] reality of the spirit and make it
[2:24:14] work let it work in
[2:24:17] us let it grow in US
[2:24:22] when you're a baby you just
[2:24:29] drink I become me that I might become
[2:24:32] him he was the son of God I was a sinner
[2:24:36] he take my place become a sinner that I
[2:24:40] might be a Son of God about my father's
[2:24:47] business that's what he says here
[2:24:51] paragraph
[2:24:52] 54 we find that when this little tree it
[2:24:56] pushes out and when it grows it pushes
[2:25:01] out and when you are born into the
[2:25:03] kingdom of God just a little baby in
[2:25:08] Jesus everything that you have need
[2:25:11] of in this life's
[2:25:14] journey is in you when you receive the
[2:25:18] Holy Spirit
[2:25:22] The Works are in you that's right
[2:25:25] because the works are in the
[2:25:28] spirit what's the thing that's keeping
[2:25:32] that Spirit from doing those
[2:25:36] works that's our
[2:25:39] challenge yes sir that's what we've got
[2:25:42] to find
[2:25:43] out are we too entangled into the world
[2:25:47] what is the weight that's keeping us us
[2:25:51] from
[2:25:52] running that's the challenge that you
[2:25:55] have to meet as
[2:25:59] individuals if not we think I'm going
[2:26:03] because I'm in the
[2:26:06] message but the message was the
[2:26:09] restoration of the
[2:26:11] faith and the faith was the restoration
[2:26:14] of the works
[2:26:21] everything that you have need of in your
[2:26:22] life journey is in you when you receive
[2:26:25] the Holy Ghost oh then what do we
[2:26:30] have oh then what do you have to do is
[2:26:35] drink and drink and keep drinking don't
[2:26:39] stop when you join church and are
[2:26:43] baptized just keep drinking till you
[2:26:47] have faith for this and Faith for that
[2:26:52] and Faith for this and push out until
[2:26:56] all the
[2:26:58] manifestations of the holy spirit is
[2:27:01] living in the
[2:27:05] church could it be we're not drinking
[2:27:08] enough could it be we're not going to
[2:27:10] the message could it be a lot of you are
[2:27:12] here you're in your school books you're
[2:27:15] you're in your music you're in your
[2:27:17] fellowship
[2:27:20] you're in the
[2:27:24] theology but you've got to take a drink
[2:27:27] of the person of Jesus
[2:27:32] Christ so if he's in you he'll
[2:27:36] re you become
[2:27:42] him and a rewarder of them that diligent
[2:27:45] seek now we are planted we are planted
[2:27:48] in Jesus Christ
[2:27:51] now I believe just in
[2:27:55] my estimation of him that he's an
[2:28:00] inexhaustible Fountain of Life am that
[2:28:03] you cannot ex exhaust his goodness some
[2:28:07] people think oh I hate to call on God so
[2:28:13] much that's what he wants you to
[2:28:18] do you have not
[2:28:20] because ye ask not and you ask not
[2:28:24] because you believe not ask abundantly
[2:28:28] that your joy might be
[2:28:31] filled now we're talking about a church
[2:28:34] that's working they're asking they're
[2:28:36] pleading they're praying for the sick
[2:28:39] they're praying for the
[2:28:42] captive they're not
[2:28:45] comfortable in that what they believe is
[2:28:48] going to get them there
[2:28:50] what they're resting is is that you
[2:28:53] can't believe me for what I Bel believe
[2:28:57] believe me for the works that I do
[2:29:00] because they are which
[2:29:02] testify of
[2:29:15] me he says that's what God wants ask big
[2:29:19] things
[2:29:21] I'm asking for hundreds of souls in this
[2:29:23] meeting I'm asking that every sick
[2:29:26] person enters that door will go out of
[2:29:30] here
[2:29:31] well I'm believing it I'm believing that
[2:29:36] till we go that this won't be another
[2:29:41] gathering together but it'll be a
[2:29:45] Revival he says in Yakama how about
[2:29:48] here how about us having a
[2:29:55] Revival Satan kept me out of here long
[2:29:58] enough I believe the hour is here for a
[2:30:01] real sweeping Revival in every church
[2:30:04] and around the
[2:30:09] country
[2:30:17] and we just keep reading here from a
[2:30:20] little bit and you can read with me I'm
[2:30:21] not a very good
[2:30:23] reader went out this afternoon went to a
[2:30:27] different place visiting amongst the
[2:30:29] people an old straw hat on pulled down
[2:30:34] over my face and so forth I just to see
[2:30:39] the attitude of the
[2:30:40] people you've got fine people here
[2:30:44] you've got something to work on that's
[2:30:48] right now what we've got to do is
[2:30:53] get
[2:30:55] to
[2:30:59] work we're here
[2:31:01] tonight to elect our Lord as our king of
[2:31:06] our
[2:31:07] hearts our governor our faith Giver Our
[2:31:11] God our healer Our Savior elect him in
[2:31:15] your heart and go out here now and and
[2:31:21] Care carry it to this great election
[2:31:26] that's coming at the
[2:31:29] Judgment when he will be crowned king of
[2:31:32] kings and Lord of lords get out and
[2:31:34] carry it to the
[2:31:36] people now we're living in a terrific
[2:31:39] day but all that you have need of is
[2:31:43] already supplied to you when you
[2:31:47] believe now really don't you start seen
[2:31:50] the challenge of
[2:31:52] unbelief it's not the unbelief in the
[2:31:58] theology it's the unbelief in your
[2:32:01] calling to do the works right that's the
[2:32:06] faith he's looking
[2:32:08] for the faith of his children to do the
[2:32:14] works and I'm not talking about on
[2:32:18] yourself oh I better get healed or I
[2:32:20] better get
[2:32:23] well you'll get well when God wants you
[2:32:26] to get
[2:32:27] well and it'll be for his glory you will
[2:32:33] get
[2:32:35] well cuz his word does not
[2:32:41] fail and if you're given a measure of
[2:32:44] suffering for a season you accept it
[2:32:47] with joy looking for your deliverance
[2:33:00] so many people I
[2:33:02] find already supplied to you when you
[2:33:05] believe so many people today I find when
[2:33:09] they join church and here especially in
[2:33:13] America they become Drifters
[2:33:20] they'll just well praise the
[2:33:23] Lord I've met brother
[2:33:26] brandom and I got saved and I put my
[2:33:30] name on the book and that's
[2:33:34] all I
[2:33:37] done is it some of they say they meant
[2:33:39] brother
[2:33:42] brandom you've all meant
[2:33:45] him that's all I've done just drifting
[2:33:49] we don't want to do that you never got
[2:33:53] saved just to be a member of a church
[2:33:58] you got saved to
[2:34:04] work to do the works that he did the
[2:34:08] works that I do shall you do you didn't
[2:34:12] get
[2:34:14] saved to go to
[2:34:16] church to learn a theology
[2:34:19] you got saved to
[2:34:22] work we don't dress an army up just to
[2:34:26] lay around on the corner and flirt with
[2:34:28] the girls with a pretty uniform on we
[2:34:31] train an army to
[2:34:33] fight and we're not a on a picnic we're
[2:34:38] on a Battleground that's right we're
[2:34:40] right here facing the enemy of our Lord
[2:34:45] and the enemy of our souls let us be up
[2:34:49] and do doing a heart for and doing with
[2:34:54] a heart for any
[2:34:58] Strife let's be
[2:35:01] doing I like the Psalm of Life be not
[2:35:05] like a dumb driven
[2:35:08] cattle have to be driven you into a
[2:35:12] little Corral somewhere and over this
[2:35:15] way and down this way let's be heroes
[2:35:20] life of Great Men all remind us that we
[2:35:25] make our lives
[2:35:27] Sublime with parting leaving behind us
[2:35:31] footprints on the sands of time
[2:35:34] footprints that perhaps another while
[2:35:38] sailing over life solemn man from a
[2:35:43] foreign Lorn and Shipwrecked brother in
[2:35:46] seeing our Footprints shall take heart
[2:35:51] again let us do something we're written
[2:35:59] Epistles I'll just keep reading and then
[2:36:01] I'll
[2:36:03] close here's some time ago a few years

[2:42:57] behind
[2:42:58] it what are we doing building a platform
[2:43:02] for our Lord we want to bring him to
[2:43:07] Bedford we want to bring him in this
[2:43:10] great
[2:43:11] Revival we've got to elect him in our
[2:43:14] own Hearts we've got to purpose
[2:43:17] something
[2:43:19] get something to do with it something to
[2:43:23] do for some purpose you don't just join
[2:43:28] the church and drift
[2:43:32] on you don't do it that way you always
[2:43:37] you've got to have a purpose in what
[2:43:40] you're doing the wife says well I'm just
[2:43:43] a
[2:43:46] wife get on the telephone do
[2:43:50] something do something to help the Lord
[2:43:54] Jesus
[2:43:54] [Music]
[2:43:56] now do oh that's so
[2:44:01] beautiful what's his purpose his purpose
[2:44:04] is to save his purpose he wants to
[2:44:07] continue to do his work so he was one
[2:44:11] man so he poured his spirit and now he's
[2:44:14] got little Messiahs little gods and
[2:44:18] what's he saying Help help me do what I
[2:44:21] was anointed to do I was anointed to
[2:44:24] heal the brokenhearted to heal the sick
[2:44:27] to deliver the bruis that's what the
[2:44:29] anointing was given I'm going to app
[2:44:32] that anointing on you that you can be
[2:44:39] me and that the works that I
[2:44:42] do you do also yes
[2:44:46] sir help me
[2:44:53] that's all Jesus is
[2:44:54] asking help me I've got lost children
[2:44:58] out there help
[2:45:06] me can you
[2:45:08] imagine the
[2:45:12] master if you can see through the veils
[2:45:14] of
[2:45:15] Flesh and the master saying help me
[2:45:19] I've came to restore the
[2:45:22] faith I sent the son of man
[2:45:26] Ministry and we've you've all accepted
[2:45:29] the
[2:45:30] theology but we haven't accepted the
[2:45:34] work help
[2:45:41] me they were invited to a work and one
[2:45:45] had an ox in a ditch one had this one
[2:45:47] had that let's shake the
[2:45:57] excuses now there is a
[2:46:00] time that a man can come to a
[2:46:04] place where he can have a
[2:46:09] purpose is something that's changed
[2:46:13] him and that is when a man meets
[2:46:20] God a man can never be the same if he
[2:46:24] ever meets God face to face it'll change
[2:46:28] him in spirit of
[2:46:31] anything you can do about it a man can
[2:46:36] never be the same after he
[2:46:39] once meets God
[2:46:45] Amen I think
[2:46:47] that in so
[2:46:49] many places it's the
[2:46:54] fault and I won't say other Ministries
[2:46:56] many many times our very Ministry is
[2:47:01] that we always preach the people get the
[2:47:03] spirit because if you have the spirit
[2:47:06] it's
[2:47:08] over you're sealed
[2:47:11] in and then you really come to the
[2:47:13] realization one day that's never why he
[2:47:15] gave the spirit that's right we were
[2:47:18] already sealed
[2:47:22] in our names always are on the books of
[2:47:26] life if we had eternal life we always
[2:47:28] had
[2:47:30] it he never gave us his
[2:47:36] Spirit he gave us his
[2:47:39] Spirit to do the
[2:47:45] work herein is the love of God
[2:47:49] that in this world as he is in this
[2:47:55] world so are
[2:47:58] we and so I I I just admonish you that a
[2:48:04] Revival isn't getting people to
[2:48:07] church it's Reviving what you already
[2:48:11] have it's getting us back to
[2:48:14] work us back about the father's business
[2:48:18] it gets us back about a
[2:48:23] purpose
[2:48:27] and and I I
[2:48:30] just my heart's ate up with
[2:48:34] it I I I I sit back and I look and I
[2:48:38] thought I told the brothers I said I'm
[2:48:40] Irish but this year I'm becoming
[2:48:44] Dutch they said' what do you mean I said
[2:48:46] I'm not buying everybody's dinner
[2:48:51] I'm going handing out
[2:48:54] everything I I I'll guarantee I bought
[2:48:57] 30,000 plus dollars worth of lunches and
[2:49:00] dinners and I thought what a waste of
[2:49:05] God's
[2:49:09] money buying stuff that's not even
[2:49:15] healthy you know you say well why is
[2:49:18] that that bother you brother McGary
[2:49:20] that's such a wonderful thing no that's
[2:49:25] drifting that's no
[2:49:28] purpose I could have put a sound system
[2:49:31] in this church there so much I could
[2:49:34] have done I I sit back and I realize
[2:49:38] there's so much I could be doing so some
[2:49:42] sort of more Outreach I know all this
[2:49:44] pandemic has tried to kill us but you
[2:49:46] know what we work through it
[2:49:50] cuz we're going to be workers we're
[2:49:52] going to have purpose we're going to get
[2:49:54] involved in the battle sir we've got to
[2:49:58] pull
[2:49:59] ourselves up by our
[2:50:01] bootstraps and recognize that this
[2:50:04] Spirit was given to us to
[2:50:06] move let's get rid of the weight that so
[2:50:10] easily besets us I I was
[2:50:15] wondering Julia could could I ask you to
[2:50:18] come and sing that song that you sang at
[2:50:22] our watch Night Service this morning as
[2:50:26] and brother Billy could
[2:50:29] come I I just hope that you could
[2:50:33] see
[2:50:37] that part of our ability to
[2:50:41] overcome is to be about the father's
[2:50:44] work you'll find out a lot of the
[2:50:47] spirits will lead leave you when you're
[2:50:50] about the father's
[2:50:52] business the prophet of God said you got
[2:50:54] to have a purpose for being
[2:50:57] healed if if your sickness is keeping
[2:51:01] you from the father's business then you
[2:51:04] have a
[2:51:06] right to claim and push that Spirit out
[2:51:11] of your
[2:51:12] life I I the reason I love this song so
[2:51:16] much is Just it says and I'm going to
[2:51:20] tell I've come to tell
[2:51:22] you and I I that's got to be his church
[2:51:27] we got to rise up out of being a
[2:51:30] theological
[2:51:33] church amen we've got to rise up to a
[2:51:38] church and a people and individuals that
[2:51:42] are about their father's business so if
[2:51:47] if she would come and sing that for
[2:51:51] me tonight are you here
