He Does Care
Sunday Morning Service
Br. Tom Rae
CLT Annual Meetings
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 16th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

[music] for my rain, [music] my shine, my all [music] the great [music] heave [singing and music] my savior. Savior and all the fullness. [music] &gt;&gt; That's an approaching prayer. You pray in your heart. Our gracious heavenly father. Lord, we've assembled this morning at your feet, [music] knowing that you're Lord of Lord and King of Kings, creator of all things, a mighty God. And you so loved us, you sent your only begotten son that those who would believe on his name, you have given them power to become the sons and daughters of God. We've come this morning that we could be better sons and better daughters. That we could sit at your feet and learn of you. You could direct our path. You can speak words of life and wisdom and strength to us. Lord, we're nothing without you. As our brother spoke, the natural breath of our birth life will fail us. But you've given us the breath of your spirit that will lead us to eternity. Father, may that breath of life breathe within our spirits this morning. Father, we ask that you would forgive us any of our trespasses, any of our wrong thinking and bad attitudes and failed conclusions. But like Nan Nathaniel, Father, we come and to you and aresh to hear from you this morning. And we believe that you will speak because you promised that wherever two or three gathered together there you'd be in our midst. So by promise you're here. Give us Isab that we may see. We ask it this morning in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you. Love him this morning. We'd like to thank you once again uh for coming out to the house of the Lord. Uh somebody said, "Well, who's that brother?" I'm David McGary. I'm the pastor here. and and uh uh these are our minister brother here in the the church. I've got David and Matthew. They're my two sons. They don't they preach. And I have another son named Aaron that ministers in Arizona. And uh this is brother Paul, brother Sergio, brother Ben, and brother Billy, and brother Andrews, the tall brother in the back. So that's that's our local ministry and uh uh uh I don't have to preach very often because uh these men really love the word of the Lord and they're great. So [music] I I thank them for being here and throwing their shoulder to the wheel and all of you that help. If you had that wonderful pulled pork the other morning, that was brother Tim Syler cooked that pulled pork and and uh if you're really nice to him, he might do a special order for you. So, you never know. But that was really wonderful. Do you love him today? We we're also so grateful to have uh here just a month ago, brother Abby passed on to be with the Lord. He he fought a good fight and he ran a great race and he had tremendous influence in my life in lives around the world. a zeal for this message that I wish was able to be passed on, but it's just built in a certain way. His daughters are with us and their husbands today. We welcome them. Brother Tom's three sons are with us today and we're grateful to that. And to the family for their loss, but for their sacrifice that they've given to this gospel. We just trust that the Lord will continue to bless you and give you zeal and strength to carry on the great legacy that lives within you. I'm thankful for the Lord with all my heart and I'm trust today that each of you will reach out and touch the hem of his garment. Brother Michael, we appreciate that word yesterday. &gt;&gt; Amen.

We will we'll just get right into the uh word this morning and invite brother Tom to come and brother Tom. [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Thank you. Tom's a wonderful friend of mine. I forced my friendship upon him and him being a Christian, he had to accept it. So that's one thing I like about Christianity. Christians love the unlovable. Amen. So So I'm grateful for that.

I We're all standing, but sister Joanne, his wife's here with him, and &gt;&gt; we appreciate him. Brother Ed has passed [music] on and brother Tom has stepped into that role and God's been mighty to keep the work going and [music] and so we we have a lot of respect for him. So let's enter into the word today. I know that he loves you. He loves God's people and I know he's got something on his heart that will mend yours. &gt;&gt; It'll strengthen you.

And it's uh it's just all together lovely and to [music] meet these dear brethrens behind here that have have supported brother David and they've [music] been faithful all these years and sons that love the Lord Jesus. and Billy meant so much [music] to me over the years. And I I just feel like I'm at home and sometimes I take too much liberty because I feel like this is my second home. And and [music] David and Sister Lesie have uh meant so much to me and my family over the years. It's hard to [music] articulate it. It's just from our hearts, we love you dearly. from our hearts. We love you dearly. [music] Well, I I have to change my a little bit here because um I don't know exactly, but I you did sing a song that I like, but I hate the title. Babylon. I mean, who on earth? Huh? Egypt. That's it. Who put Babylon? I hate Egypt. Also, [laughter] let's get it straight. Okay. Babylon and Egypt. In fact, at home, I think we changed the title to deliverance. [laughter] Would it be all right to sing that before we go to the word? [laughter] &gt;&gt; All right. Help me sing it, would you, please? [music] Okay. The wonder [singing] of how you brought the [music] deliverance in the [singing] exodus of my heart. [music] You found me. You freed me. Help back the waters [singing] of my relief.

You mared [music] me out in freedom into the promised land. [music] Now I will not forget you. I sing [singing] up all you down [music] swallow forever by the fury of your [music] love. You're the God who fights for me. Oh your [singing] victory. [music] Hallelu. Hallelu. [music] on the sea. You have led me to [singing] Hallelu. [music] Hallelu. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow and pray. Heavenly Father, you've done it all. You've done it all. It's all because of your amazing grace within our lives, [music] Lord. That seed that you dropped in there before the foundation of the world, Lord, is now manifesting [music] amongst the people in this hour. Lord, we love your children and we love the presence of the Lord. And we're just asking, Lord, that you'll take this little message this morning, feed the sheep. You're the great shepherd. Lord, we want to be led of your spirit. We're thankful for brother David and the men of God that have stood with him these years. God, make it a great lighthouse to this area. Lord, knowing, Lord, darkness is upon the land. But arise and shine as the word of God is declared, your light indeed has [music] come. And we're praying that the light of God will shine on your people this morning, Lord God, making your word alive to each and everyone. We ask it in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. And I failed to mention my my wife, my darling. [snorts] She's down there somewhere. She's There she is. She's hiding behind somebody's head. There you are, darling. God bless you, sweetheart. Amen. Can you turn please to First Peter chapter 5? Musicians, thank you so much. I'm I want to get one thing off my chest right away. The brothers have given me a terrible complex. Um, somehow someway I seem to quote out of Christ the mystery of God revealed for the last 10 or so years. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; So, I just happen to have it. [laughter] I didn't want I didn't want anybody to feel bad. But it's one of the greatest messages &gt;&gt; because for us that we say the seals are open, right? Then it becomes a almost a common statement. Uh the seals are open. But without the opening of the seals, you wouldn't even know what Christ the mystery of God has revealed. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said the message token should have followed the seals. So under the seals, the token message was preached. So anything under the seals is what I love. &gt;&gt; This it makes Christ alive to me. And so, you know, we might requle &gt;&gt; just like you've never been in a service before. It's the first time you've ever heard the quote, the first time you ever heard the scripture. And you know, when the first time you heard it, there was a little bit of excitement inside. I don't know about you, I'm not a dead potato. I I'm I'm [laughter] something that just just likes a little bit of life there. You know what I mean? When there's a you did you anybody here read the seals before? Huh? You heard of the seals? You heard the seal. Of course, the fifth seal, huh? There's a little bit of stimulation with revelation, RIGHT? WE WANT REVELATION. NO STIMULATION. &gt;&gt; Come on, wake up. &gt;&gt; If it's alive, it's alive. &gt;&gt; You don't want to make believe it. You just do it. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, you take the air of the balloon and go. You don't have to make the balloon do it, does it? You know, you love the word, there's something in you that bubble ups inside. &gt;&gt; So, as let's just read before we get carried away here. First Peter chapter 1 Peter chapter 5 verse 6. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time, casting all your cares upon him, for he cares for I know it's not it's it's church, but it's class, right? He cares for who? This Bible was written to who? &gt;&gt; Exactly. So now the Bible says, "Casting all your cares upon him, for he carth for &gt;&gt; me." He cares for you. Now church of the living God, if he cares for you once, he has always cares for you. &gt;&gt; He cannot uncare for you. God does not change his mind &gt;&gt; about his word. &gt;&gt; I'm So I'm looking all the way to the back corner to that corner. Chris, where are you? Chris, there you are. It's at the door. All the way to the corners. All the way to the front. I want you to know he cares for you. &gt;&gt; Don't have no pity party, please. &gt;&gt; Pity party is out in the parking lot. They'll have some teacups and some tables set up for you as you used to have. &gt;&gt; We're not a pitiful people. &gt;&gt; We're a people that God cares for &gt;&gt; and he cares for you. &gt;&gt; And it has to be individual. &gt;&gt; It can't be, well, he cares for brother David or he cares for the deacons or he cares for the ministry. He cares for you very much so. He cares for you. Be sober. Be vigilant. Because your adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion walketh about seeking to whom he may devour. But you have to remember the scripture before that says that. &gt;&gt; Oh, the devil goes about as a roaring lion, but has already told you, I care for you. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Right. I I I already carry. So the devil goes about as a roaring lion. BUT I CARE FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; SO YOU TELL ME WHAT lion can get you. &gt;&gt; Couldn't get Daniel. &gt;&gt; Couldn't get Samson. &gt;&gt; You tell me can get you this morning. &gt;&gt; He cares for you. My whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same affections are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world, but the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that You have suffered a while make you unperfect. &gt;&gt; Come just a second here. &gt;&gt; Makes you what? &gt;&gt; Makes you perfect, established, strengthened, and settled. &gt;&gt; That's enough to rejoice today. &gt;&gt; Lift up your VOICE AND SAY, "PRAISE GOD. I WENT TO CHURCH TODAY AND KNOW WHO I AM IN CHRIST JESUS. &gt;&gt; But the God of grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while makes you perfect. Can you please do me a favor and turn right and say you're perfect? &gt;&gt; Hey, Ally, turn. Come on. That was your left. Right's the other way. Right's the other way. There you go. [laughter] I I got it. I I I I get it. Okay. Now, turn left. That's amazing, isn't it? Change the whole atmosphere. [laughter] Change the whole atmosphere when you realize what the word of God says you are. &gt;&gt; You know, the Catholic Church will tell you this morning how rotten you are and you'll never make it. And here's a few indulgence for you and you might be out of purgatory in 5 million years &gt;&gt; and you might make it to heaven. I got a prophet that says you've already made it. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE IT. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS A PROPHECY SPOKEN THROUGH MALACHI 4 TO YOU THIS MORNING. YOU'VE ALREADY IN GLORY. &gt;&gt; But it's HOW DO WE GET DOWN? I DON'T KNOW. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; Maybe it's our flesh. But remember the roaring lion. &gt;&gt; But before the roaring lion was, he cared for you. &gt;&gt; He died for you. He rose for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads one more time. Father, we've read your word. We pray God that you'll take it now and make it alive to each and every one of us. Not just words that we hear on our ear, but Lord, may we hear in the inner man. We ask in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may have your seats. You thought I was going to have you standing, didn't you? Say, "Well, that preacher let me sit down." I'll let you sit down. But one thing we do love, we love the word of God. We love it in truth and purity. We don't like it manhandled. We don't want it our uh the mind of Tom Ray. We We've already been given the mind of God already through Malachi 4. Say what I say. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't. It's that simple. &gt;&gt; You don't have to add to it or take away from it. You just have to say it, believe it, and watch the angel of the Lord that backed up that prophet back up what you say. &gt;&gt; It's that that simple to me. And so this morning, I I really like to preach on he does care. &gt;&gt; He does care. A lot of us, we get into our own worlds. We get into our own families. We get into our own situations. We we maybe sit in a church this size and and we can get lost in the crowd and we can start to say, "Nobody cares for me. Nobody cares for me. Nobody acknowledges me. Nobody tells me how well I did at the the in the kitchen yesterday. You sisters were phenomenal. You were absolutely phenomenal. I loved it when I saw those plastic gloves. I said, "What? Where have we gone to pray over it and then you don't have to have pray?" [snorts] That's pretty dicey. I know I'm on the ice, but that's okay. But I don't mind your plastic gloves. But you did phenomenally. &gt;&gt; All you brothers that work so hard to make these meetings, you are phenomenal. And God cares because you didn't do that for your own self. You did that for the body, which the body is Christ. And you did a a great labor of love. You, the musicians, the choir, the singing, they're all special. I'm watching you there. And and I I'm I'm standing, Brother David watches me, and I'm I got my feet moving and I go, I want to go sing with them. [snorts] But you all did so fantastically, musicians. so wonderfully to make these meetings. And yes indeed, he does care. He hears the cry of the heart. [snorts] I just spoke the other night. Still real. It's always real to me. He heard and does hear my desparing cry. from the waters lifted me. Now safe am I. He cares. So you can look around and you say, "Well, I don't know this brother. This brother's never shaken my hand." It doesn't matter. I don't even know how that became an issue. &gt;&gt; You know, you go to a certain church, my church or our church, and and somebody doesn't shake your hand, they got their nose out a joint that far. and uh he doesn't like me and how come he didn't shake my hand and he's got something against and you fabricated a whole thing &gt;&gt; and we do it all the time and we're all guilty &gt;&gt; but let's just let's just drive that thing out of our lives &gt;&gt; and say really it doesn't really matter because he cares &gt;&gt; that's all he cares That's all that matters. We get it all built up and we want position. We want to be recognized. Who cares? If I'm the dormat of glory, I will be a very happy man. &gt;&gt; If I'm in the back parts of eternity somewhere, as long I'm in eternity, I'm a happy camper. I'm not looking for the left or the right seat or front seat, back seat. I don't care where I am. I just want to make heaven. &gt;&gt; But I've already been told I've made it. &gt;&gt; And so then it should just take all the worry away, &gt;&gt; all the concerns away. Do you don't think that God can't pay your paycheck, your rent, your electrical bill? &gt;&gt; You might not have a lot of money, &gt;&gt; but he never will see his seed begging bread. &gt;&gt; You just got to take God at at his promise because he cares. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, boy, Tom, you're such a simple preacher." Well, that's all right as long as we live as high as we shout. &gt;&gt; I'm okay with that. &gt;&gt; I really am okay. I don't need to tell you how much I know. I don't know nothing. And we we spend five or four hours and the people are half asleep anyways. &gt;&gt; Just don't fall asleep if I'm 45 minutes. [snorts] I'm watching you. [snorts] God cares for you. He loves you. He loves He loves his redeemed. You saying, "How great is our God? How great is our God? But he doesn't care for my problem." It's just such weirdness. &gt;&gt; Is that weird to you or is that just me? &gt;&gt; You're saying he's awesome God. [laughter] He feels the heavens, &gt;&gt; but he doesn't know my address. &gt;&gt; We have to get away from all this. &gt;&gt; It's growing up time. &gt;&gt; It's maturing time. It's wheat time. &gt;&gt; It's harvest time. &gt;&gt; It's a son of man coming back to son of man time. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a God we serve. My Bible is I'm sure your Bible is the same. It's King James. So says, "But my God shall supply some of your needs." &gt;&gt; No, just a second. Some of you said no sir. Some of you didn't say no sir or nothing. I want you to say that's nothing but the truth. My God will supply all my needs. My God shall supply all your needs according to his riches and glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] my another translation to help maybe somebody else that my God will liberally supply &gt;&gt; and fill every need according to his riches and glory. &gt;&gt; So now you say, well, okay, now there's a huge spectrum here. We got young ladies that said, I want a man. I got young men men say, I want a lady. Just relax. Wow. I didn't get paid to say that. &gt;&gt; God has your bride. &gt;&gt; God has your bridegroom. &gt;&gt; You know the old song, matchmaker, matchmaker, make me. Yeah. Match. He'll make your match. &gt;&gt; And we thank God for that. He will supply all your need. &gt;&gt; My God will fill all your needs according to his riches in glory. Then you ask the question this morning on a Sunday morning. What is my need? &gt;&gt; What is my cry? &gt;&gt; Now everything that we say, well, you got some young men said, "Well, I need a I need a fast hot car." Oh, come on. I need a I don't even know that the the thing 450 Hemi four barrel high eight barrel. I don't know what it is. But that car in five years is a bunch of junk. &gt;&gt; My need is him. &gt;&gt; We have to separate what the Bible is talking about. He's not caring about your needs as such. He's caring about your desire for him. &gt;&gt; You get him, you get everything. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY HAD NO FISH. 5,000 PEOPLE, BUT THEY HAD CHRIST. &gt;&gt; THEY GOT FISH. &gt;&gt; According to his riches and glory, then what is my need? I need him. &gt;&gt; I need to be. Brother Bram said, "Revelation." You need to pray more for revelation than anything else. You should pray for revelation more than anything else. So I ask you the question this morning, did you pray for it? &gt;&gt; Lord, revelate me. &gt;&gt; I just don't want to know God in my mind. I need to know him from my heart. &gt;&gt; I need the revelation of God. And that becomes a coin word. I just need a revelation. &gt;&gt; It's deep. &gt;&gt; I need him to know him is life and life eternal. What an hour we're living in. What a day we're living in that's trying to take away all your desires that you have for him. That's what everything's designed. I don't have my iPhone. I did bring an iPad. I have a computer. I'm still I I'm not in the rock age yet. Still, right? I moved. But in technology and in anything, remember tree, good, evil. &gt;&gt; So there's good things and there's bad things. Just use it for the good things. &gt;&gt; That's all that we care for. God is a very present help in time of your trouble. 1 John 3 and1 says, "Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us that we shall be called the sons of God. Therefore, the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not." &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? So when you go work at a grocery store, they might not understand that you are an absolute son of the living God, but you are the son of the living God and you are a daughter of God. &gt;&gt; So now our actions are is what are is what confirms our confession. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; Beloved, beloved. Now, &gt;&gt; now, &gt;&gt; so now you have to understand this Bible has been written for 2,000 years. And God knew that there would come a time when the full word would be opened up and the hearts of men and women that love their God, their Lord Jesus with all their mind, soul, and strength come to a completion or I would say a climax. Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him &gt;&gt; as he is. &gt;&gt; Ah, okay. I'm slowing down. I'm slowing down. It's okay. &gt;&gt; I'll slow down. It'll maybe help some. We believe now we are the sons and daughters of God. It does not yet appear. But when it says when Christ in Colossians says when Christ &gt;&gt; who is our life &gt;&gt; shall appear &gt;&gt; and brother Bram says he's appearing amongst us. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. I'm I'm only saying what he said. So when Christ who is our life shall appear, we shall also appear with him &gt;&gt; in glory. And people say, "Well, that's when we're in glory." Well, look up the word that glory there. That actually means God's opinion of what you are. &gt;&gt; So when Christ appears, &gt;&gt; there's a BRIDE THAT APPEARS LIKE HIM &gt;&gt; IN HIS THOUGHTS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And so God has a people that are literally called the bride of Jesus Christ that are going to fulfill the prophecy &gt;&gt; that have been spoken of her. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preaches a message. Michael alluded to it last night. Masterpiece. He fulfilled the Old Testament and all the prophecies concerning himself. So then he says, "Now in the New Testament, the bride part will manifest all the prophecies concerning herself." &gt;&gt; So it's not a church member, &gt;&gt; it's sunship, &gt;&gt; it's daughtership, &gt;&gt; life of his life, &gt;&gt; spirit of his spirit, &gt;&gt; nature of his nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; LIFE OF HIS LIFE. SHE'S HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So now we start to understand that and we can make all these theories all about it. But what that's going to be proved is by your life. &gt;&gt; It's by your life. How you [snorts] walk, how you talk, how you act. How many of us How many of us and please I now I'm a pastor I guess. So tell me. So, Brother David, please, if I get out of line being in your pulpit, you just say Tom. That's for me to say, not you, Tom. How many of us say sharp things to one another? Sharp. I I I'm just I'm just I'm just get I I'm not even near where I'm going. So, how many have ever said something sharp to somebody, &gt;&gt; you know? We all have. Come on. We all said something sharp. But now, let's just take a look at this. Did Jesus say something sharp? &gt;&gt; Okay, give me an example. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; He called the woman a dog. &gt;&gt; A dog. Ah, he called her a dog. But that was exactly what she was. That wasn't sharp. That's what she was. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's what they were. That's what they were. &gt;&gt; You We're get I want you to get the point. &gt;&gt; Okay. That's what she they were and that's what she was. But that's not what you are. &gt;&gt; Here we go. THIS IS TOM'S LAST YEAR. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID. That's right. [laughter] Well, really, when we say, "Well, I want to be I want to be like Jesus to be like, you rotten scoundrel." Now, he did call the Pharisees snakes in the grass. Is that true? But that's what they were. &gt;&gt; But you're not a scoundrel. You're the bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; You're the beautiful bride elected. &gt;&gt; Treat one another that way. &gt;&gt; Act like that to one another. &gt;&gt; Build up one another in the faith. &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW WE ARE THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, an excuse is, "Well, that's my nature." Well, get a nature change. GET A NATURE CHANGE. Get born again. &gt;&gt; All right, that's enough on that point. Every man that hath this hope in him purifies [snorts] himself. &gt;&gt; He doesn't need you to impurify him. How many knows their own problems? &gt;&gt; It should be 100% here because I look in the mirror every morning &gt;&gt; and I see Tom Ray. &gt;&gt; I know my problem. I don't need you to tell me my problem. &gt;&gt; We'll get through the opening scripture. We'll be okay. It's okay. What we need is to know who we are in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The hour that we're living in, Jesus says, "The hour has now come. Father, glorify thy son that thy son might glorify thee." I can say to you that this morning by the same scripture, Father, &gt;&gt; glorify your bride &gt;&gt; so that your bride might glorify. &gt;&gt; Exactly. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Exactly. Glorify you. Knowest thou all things the brother, brother Brmond says, it's in him eternal life. Now we are the sons of God. Not we will be. we are now. Now, we're talking about 1952 when I wasn't even born yet. And he's preaching prophecy. Thank you, Brother David, for last night's closing because that's exactly what I believe. He was preaching prophecy in 1952. And now he's speaking and he's saying now we are the sons of God not we will be. That's what the trouble of it is. People you begin people that's born again. People call you holy ruler fanatic or something like that because you've been born again but you let the devil kick you around like a football. So when somebody says that to you said, "I am not that. I'm a son of God. I've been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I am not that. I'm a daughter of God. I am not that." Don't let the devil kick you around. &gt;&gt; 1952. Don't let the ka de devil kick you around like a football. You know what he says? Stand your ground. &gt;&gt; Stand your ground. &gt;&gt; You're not a football. &gt;&gt; You're in Christ. That's what you are. Amen. Absolutely. You are in him. &gt;&gt; Those that are born again are not a football. &gt;&gt; You're a son and daughter of God. And today we can say as now brother Brandham says in Christ the mystery of God revealed page 85 for anybody that wants to know. Brother Billy it says now we are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Not we will be &gt;&gt; preached in 1963. Not we will be. We are &gt;&gt; we are we're redeemed. &gt;&gt; And we have the devil's answer. &gt;&gt; GOD'S A VINDICATED himself in you. &gt;&gt; I love this. &gt;&gt; I love this. He's a vindicated himself in you. &gt;&gt; So now he preaches a message proving his word. So you say, "Well, that's a nice message." &gt;&gt; But it's more than a nice message. &gt;&gt; You say, "You're the word." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm getting down to your address. &gt;&gt; You say, "You're the word." &gt;&gt; I've been the I'm the word made flesh today. That's what the scripture says. &gt;&gt; So then God's going to prove his word. &gt;&gt; He's going to prove you &gt;&gt; as the redeemed of God. Perfect. &gt;&gt; Now we are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; We have Satan's answer. &gt;&gt; God vindicates himself. God proves himself in uh to his promise of this day. The headship is here. Christ, &gt;&gt; he's the risen Lord. He's here &gt;&gt; in the same power &gt;&gt; as his resurrection. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; CHURCH OF GOD, SAY [screaming] AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE SAME POWER &gt;&gt; THAT RAISED CHRIST FROM THE DEAD IS HERE THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; GLORY, &gt;&gt; SAME POWER, &gt;&gt; SAME LIFE, same spirit. IF THAT SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED CHRIST FROM THE DEAD dwell in you, &gt;&gt; does it dwell in you? &gt;&gt; IT SHALL QUICKEN &gt;&gt; YOUR MORTAL BODY. &gt;&gt; TAKE THAT, DEVIL. &gt;&gt; I AM NO FOOTBALL. &gt;&gt; I'M A SON and daughter of God. &gt;&gt; And he cares. &gt;&gt; He cares. Why? Because one day, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; I cried out and he heard my desparing cry. &gt;&gt; You cried out. &gt;&gt; God saved you. But the problem of it is life complicates your simple salvation. Your salvation is very simple. &gt;&gt; But you've complicated it through life. And Satan complicates it. because of this and this and this, I can't have this and this and that &gt;&gt; because you've got it all worked up in your mind. &gt;&gt; You worry about your sons and your daughters and and rightly so. I worried about my sons and my daughters. But there had to come a time when you had to rest. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; You had to rest and believe that God was going to deliver your sons and daughters. He said it. &gt;&gt; Ah, he said it. &gt;&gt; Brother Pam said in a token message, you're only asking what you are already. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHERE IS THAT RESURRECTION? &gt;&gt; IT'S IN YOU. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE ONLY ASKING WHAT'S ALREADY IN YOU. MY THE CHURCH IS HIS FAILURE. &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Matthew. That's exactly right. Paragraph, not paragraphed. It says at the bottom of page one, I'm at 85. It says the church is his victory. But the REASON WHY SHE SAYS VICTORY, &gt;&gt; IT SAYS BEFORE IT YOU'RE JUSTIFIED. &gt;&gt; OH, &gt;&gt; OKAY. SO, SO, SO, SO, SO, so justified. Justified. You never did it. &gt;&gt; Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. THAT WAS MEAGER. That was weak. &gt;&gt; COME ON. ARE YOU JUSTIFIED? &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU BEEN BORN AGAIN? &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUSTIFIED. &gt;&gt; YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE BECAUSE YOU NEVER DID IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. YOU ARE HIS VICTORY. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE HIS VICTORY. YOU'RE HIS VICTORY BECAUSE HE JUSTIFIED YOU. My is a glorious church and I am a member washed in the blood of the lamb. We know the song. &gt;&gt; It's because OF THE BLOOD. AND PEOPLE, LET ME JUST SAY, I'm sorry, saints. Let me just say this. The blood is not a chemical that's red. &gt;&gt; It's the life in the blood. [applause] &gt;&gt; So you say, "WELL, WELL, BROTHER TOM, I I NEED GOD'S LIFE." That's exactly what we need. Not a Baptist life, &gt;&gt; cuz that will fail you. A Pentecostal life will fail you. ONLY THIS MESSAGE I I'M SORRY IF I'M STOPPING ON TOES. THIS MESSAGE IS JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WITHOUT THIS [screaming] MESSAGE, THERE IS NO LIFE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A THOUGHT. IT'S [screaming] A LIFE. THIS MESSAGE IS NOT, OH, IT'S A THOUGHT OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM. IT WAS AN ANGEL &gt;&gt; THAT TOOK A BODY THAT SPOKE FROM GLORY TO TELL YOU, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUSTIFIED. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I CARE [screaming] FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; YEAH. DON'T COMPLICATE IT. &gt;&gt; WELL, MY SON'S THIS AND MY DAUGHTER'S THAT. DON'T COMPLICATE IT. TRUST GOD. &gt;&gt; WATCH GOD MOVE ON YOUR BEHALF. &gt;&gt; He cares. &gt;&gt; Cares. Do you care? &gt;&gt; He That's what he preached. He cares. Do you? &gt;&gt; If he cares, we should care, shouldn't we? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes. Absolutely. And God bless you. I know you do. What a wonderful message we believe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see, these people are trying to live a Christian life without the life of the blood. &gt;&gt; And you will fall on your face miserably. &gt;&gt; You will. &gt;&gt; But if you've got Christ in you, &gt;&gt; this living word living in you, you cannot fail. The problem is, brother Bram said in Satan's Eden, I believe it's in one place, he said, "You're getting them to church and you're not getting them to Christ. &gt;&gt; We need to GET YOU TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST." BROTHER KEN AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE BLOOD. We knew nothing about the blood until Linda told him about the blood. K GOES, "WHAT ARE YOU TALKING about the blood? HE'S A GOOD UNITED CHURCH MEMBER playing in AN ORGAN WITH HIS LONG hair and knows nothing about the blood. But then the word comes. &gt;&gt; Then the word comes. A seed is laying there and something happens &gt;&gt; and it CHANGES SOMEBODY. IT'S NOT WHAT SHE SAID. IT'S WHAT WAS BEING LIVED. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. How great is my God? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's power in the church. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, now, now hold everybody just just Brother Tom is a very simple man. I love my Bible and I love this message. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to give you Spurgeon. Uh CS Lewis, DL Moody, great men of God. And brother Brown called them great men of God. But what they had to SAY IS NOT WHAT'S going to CHANGE YOU. &gt;&gt; SO GOD SENT YOU ELIJAH. &gt;&gt; COME ON, [screaming] REJOICE WITH ME. GOD SENT YOU ELIJAH BEFORE THE GREAT AND DREADFUL DAY of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW THE BAPTIST DOCTRINE WASN'T GOING TO DO IT FOR YOU. THE PENTECOSTAL DOCTRINE WON'T DO IT FOR YOU. THEIR FLUFF WON'T DO IT FOR YOU. BUT THE WORD HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM STAND THERE, HE SAYS, "I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE HIM my body for a temporal resurrection." Then you start to realize that wasn't William Brandom speaking &gt;&gt; is I'm not dee I'll I'll clear that up to you right now. I don't do not believe brother Brandham was Jesus Christ but he was the microphone. &gt;&gt; HE WAS THE MICROPHONE AND GOD USED THAT MICROPHONE TO TELL YOU YOU'RE A POWERFUL [screaming] CHURCH. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; DON'T LIVE BELOW your God-given standard. &gt;&gt; These are all statements you've heard over the years. But there comes a time when I was a child, &gt;&gt; I spake like a child. &gt;&gt; But when I became a man, &gt;&gt; I put away childish things. &gt;&gt; Sticks and stones that hurt my bones. And words will NEVER HURT ME. LIES, [screaming] LIES, LIES. Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words never hurt you. Come on. Words really kill you. &gt;&gt; And we heard that since we were little kids. Words won't. And then we get eaten real snitty. Now we'll go back to [laughter] the little snitty. Well, who do you think you are? Now that hurt. Especially when you respected the person that said it. &gt;&gt; So what happens that they don't get more respect, they get less respect. &gt;&gt; That went over big, but I'll let you think about it. &gt;&gt; So now we are here as Christian to build one another up &gt;&gt; in the faith. And God put into the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, preachers, teachers for the edification and the build up till we all come into the unity of the faith, not divide the body. &gt;&gt; UNITE THE BODY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's what power is in the church. She's controlled by a different law. And that law is not the keeping of a bunch of commandments. It's the law of faith. &gt;&gt; Where Jesus said, "All things are possible to them that believe." Then we say, "Lord, &gt;&gt; I believe, Lord, &gt;&gt; all things are possible. &gt;&gt; ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE THIS MORNING. YOU CAN have victory sitting right in your chair." &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. THAT CRITICAL SPIRIT COULD BE LIFTED OFF OF YOU THAT FAST. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW [screaming] YOU, SO I DON'T I'M JUST SAYING WHATEVER I'M SAYING. IT DOESN'T MATTER. WHATEVER IS ON YOU CAN LEAVE YOU THAT YOU COULD HAVE THE LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT WILL MAKE YOU LOVE YOUR BROTHER. &gt;&gt; Isn't that an oldfashioned song? &gt;&gt; Give me that old time. Huh? It will make you love your brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Don't look around like this now. Just surrender. Say, "Ouch." &gt;&gt; Ouch. And go on. &gt;&gt; You know, people live under this crazy condemnation business. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Lord, forgive me. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm not Catholic. I I don't have a stick with beads on it. &gt;&gt; You said thought you bad. You said that bad. I am so sorry. You know what? It's already under the blood &gt;&gt; and it's already forgotten. &gt;&gt; Oh, I would love to preach a message here. I preached it back home. Forgiven, forgotten forever. [cough and clears throat] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that that that's Dylan. That was a good one. I really enjoyed that one. I should have preached that again. I really like that one. Forgiven, forgotten, forever. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Exactly. Can you imagine? &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Where'd it go? &gt;&gt; Annihilated. &gt;&gt; Didn't he say once that confession hits the bleach? &gt;&gt; Did he not say that? &gt;&gt; You brothers can confirm THAT ONCE IT HITS THE BLEACH, IT ANNIHILATES IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHAT HE SAID IN THE BREACH. AND WHEN THE BREACH THEN WAS SPOKEN, THE BREACH THAT THE GAP THAT WAS BETWEEN GOD AND MAN WAS CLOSED &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE LAMB [screaming] CAME FORWARD AND CLOSED THE GAP &gt;&gt; SO THAT WE COULD HAVE FELLOWSHIP &gt;&gt; WITH our heavenly father. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Oh my, you're making me feel pretty good right now. I I I don't know what it's called running the aisles or running the pews, but I got a pretty good idea. If I run fast enough, I could he hit each pew. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Until one of you put your arm out. [laughter] It It is amazing &gt;&gt; when you start realizing who you are in Christ. &gt;&gt; And we sing the song. Maybe you don't hear, maybe you do. I can run through a tree and leap over a wall. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if they say something wrong, [laughter] I can't jump at all. I'll trip and fall. I'll do one. &gt;&gt; Ah, simplicity. You all right? &gt;&gt; They told me I could preach two and a half hours. &gt;&gt; I won't do that to you. That's just I was just away preaching with Michael. We're overseas in Africa and the sister comes up to me. I'm in the car. I'm ready to go. She says, "You didn't preach long enough." I said, "If I preach too long," you'd say, "Why doesn't he be quiet?" [snorts] But if you preach short enough, you'll want me back. She really liked that one. Don't you love the Lord? &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MOST PHENOMENAL TIME. AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE I'M PREACHING. I ENJOY. HEY, IF MICHAEL COULD PREACH, Brother David could preach, Matthew could preach, David could preach. HEY, BILLY COULD PREACH, I'D BE AS HAPPY AS I AM RIGHT NOW. I'M probably happier, &gt;&gt; you know. Oh, we got to go to church today. Really? I want to take my fishing pole and go fishing. No, I want to go to church. &gt;&gt; I want to go to church. &gt;&gt; My goodness. I remember when I lived for church. I remember when I used to live for church. I still do. I haven't changed. I said that wrong. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; But I remember missing my first service. Anybody remember missing their first service? If you can't, you never had Ken Linda on your case. I I was sicker than a dog. Honestly, if you I don't know what do that say means, but a dog could be sick probably. But I I when I get sick, my hair hurts. My air hurt, my hair hurts, my eyes hurt, every burn, and my body, my bones, and I'm laying there. I'm sick, but there's church. I couldn't hardly even roll over to get out of bed. And so I said, "Okay, I'm not going to church." So I lay there about two hours later. I can't get out of bed to answer the door hardly. So I get my Come on. Open the door and there's Ken and Linda. Where were you? I go sick. WE HAD THE BEST SERVICE BIBLE WAY HAS EVER HAD IN THEIR WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE. You know WHAT I MADE? I MADE A DECLARATION THAT DAY. Never miss church. &gt;&gt; Because that would be the best service. Huh? MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE I WASN'T THERE. I never just thought about that, Ken. But you know this is what we live for. &gt;&gt; It is really what we live for. &gt;&gt; AND GOD BLESS YOU FOR MAKING THESE special meanings so special. That's what we live for. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says, let me show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep. &gt;&gt; He cares for you. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT GOING TO LET YOU DIE. &gt;&gt; COME ON. COME ON. THERE'S GOING TO BE A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE A RAPTURE. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF YOU IF GO BY THE WAY OF THE GRAVE, you never died. &gt;&gt; You're sleeping. YOU'VE ALREADY GOT THE RAPTURE IN YOU. This concept of well, they passed away OR THEY DIED. THEY'RE MORE LIVING THAN YOU AND I ARE. BROTHER BISCLL IS ON THE HEELS OF GLORY RIGHT NOW SHOUTING PRAISES &gt;&gt; WITH A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; BEHOLD, I care so much for you. I'm going to tell you a mystery. Behold, I'm going to show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. But we shall all be changed. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ALL GOING TO GO TO SLEEP, &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE ALL GOING TO BE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; THAT MAKES ME PRETTY HAPPY. &gt;&gt; I DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THIS WHITE HAIR, BROKEN DOWN BODY. [screaming] NO MORE. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO see me skipping, shouting, running. I do that anyway. &gt;&gt; I just do it more. I'm going to show you this mystery. You're you're not going to all sleep, but you're going to all be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump. For the trump shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. &gt;&gt; Can everybody say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, let me just throw this in here. Who did Abraham meet on the way back from Lot fighting for his brother? &gt;&gt; Who did he meet? &gt;&gt; Melazdc. And Melzdc gave him bread and wine. Communion. That's what you're having right now. You're feeding off the body word of the son of man. And God has given you A STIMULATION OF REVELATION. BUT BROTHER ARAM SAID ABRAHAM THOUGHT JERUSALEM WAS COMING DOWN BECAUSE KING MELZDC WAS THERE. BUT IN THIS DAY A PROPHET SAID WHO IS THIS MELZDC? AND MELZDC BEING HERE MEANS JERUSALEM IS HERE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. DON'T GIVE UP NOW. DON'T TRIP UP NOW. LET'S GET MORE HOLY. LET'S SEND SURRENDER MORE TO GOD. RUN LIKE we've never run before. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How be it when he, the spirit of truth is come, he will guide you because he cares &gt;&gt; for you. Cares for you. He'll guide you into all truth. For he shall not speak of himself, &gt;&gt; but whatsoever he hear, he will speak, and he will show you &gt;&gt; things &gt;&gt; to come. &gt;&gt; How about with brother Brandham coming out of Finland and there's a little girl there. She's got crutches on and and and and and and she's trying to get to see brother Brandham, but there's soldiers all around. There's brothers all around him and and and and she and she bows before the prophet and she says, "Kitos, Kitos." Just grabs his coat and the brothers are pushing Brother Benham to the platform, pushing him. And the Holy Spirit shows him the vision. &gt;&gt; She's already healed. but she doesn't know it. &gt;&gt; She's already healed. Doesn't know it. So now he preaches a whole message and and and he says, "I want to shut it down. The prayer line's coming through." And the angel says, "Keep on going. Just keep on going. That's what I'm doing. I'm keep on going. THEY'LL GET IT. THEY'LL GET IT. KEEP ON GOING." AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS LITTLE GIRL COMES AND Brother Brandham turns to the interpreter and says, "You say what I say. And I thought that's pretty direct. What else would they say? He says, "You say what I say." &gt;&gt; So he turned to the little girl and he says, "God has already healed you. &gt;&gt; I SAW IT IN THE BACK ROOM, BUT I COULDN'T GET TO YOU. &gt;&gt; HE'S HERE. &gt;&gt; ELIJAH'S GOD IS WITH US TODAY. HE'S HERE. &gt;&gt; And you know what she did, Brother David? &gt;&gt; She believed what the prophet said and she walked off that platform. &gt;&gt; Huh? She didn't listen to her doctor &gt;&gt; who said, "Hey, you're going to have this problem all your life." &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother David, you cried out, ELLA. YOU CRIED OUT, "GIVE US ELLA." MOST OF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M talking about, but brother David knows that. I believe the same God that gave that girl that walking shoes is the same God that heard your faith WALKING THROUGH SOME HOTEL DOOR CRYING OUT, "MY GRANDDAUGHTER, [screaming] TOUCH MY GRANDDAUGHTER." &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. And I believe ever since that day and I thought you know what I wish I had that bravery to do what you did and I'd have admired you and I've respected you and I studying away I write that down and I just put down there Ella believe for Ella granddaughter that needs a touch from the Lord in her legs strengthening of her legs and here is a grandfather way over in Switzerland believing for her granddaughter's total healing. She's a darling of the gospel. She's a darling. And I started thinking about that little woman, that little girl, Kitos, Kitos. God bless you, brother Brandham. God bless you. And he walks around and all a sudden he sees a vision. There she is totally healed. Totally healed. And he wanted to get back TO HER SAID, "JESUS HEALED YOU, LITTLE DARLING." He said, ' But the man kept pushing him back, pushed him back into the pulpit and he started to preach anyway, started to preach. Then the prayer line came. When she finally came, he said, "Darling," he turned to the count to the interpreter, "Say what I say." And that's what I say to the preacher man. I'll say it to me. Call him, "Say what I said." &gt;&gt; Say what I say and watch the people get healed. Say what [snorts] I say. Some of them are walking strangely, but they'll get up out of their seat. They'll walk in Christ. They'll stand in Christ. They'll believe IN CHRIST. SAY WHAT I [screaming] SAY. &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE A CHANGE IN A MOMENT, [screaming] IN A TWINKLING OF AN EYE, BECAUSE HE CARES. &gt;&gt; He didn't call you to lose you. And that's why that's why I so burdened for you on on the first night. I want you all saved. I want you all born again. I want you to know him in the power of his resurrection because what you when you get that, you get all that I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; But we just I don't want you to go to church. I'm sorry if church is all your safety net. It's not good enough for you. But Jesus Christ, this living message, this living word, just believe it. You know, we had a brother one time when brother Murphy was just just in Iraq and God been dealing with the Arabic, Iranian, the Iraqis, the whole an amazing move of God that's happening over there right now. Just amazing, brother Gary. He'll fry your head. This brother, Brother Murphy, just got a text. We were in Ethiopia and his brother texts him and says, "Hey, brother Murphy, I need you to come to Iraq and I'm in a business. We're in a me meeting with all the translators and interpreters and everybody and we're trying to line everything up in Ethiopia and trying to do this, that, and everything else. The pastor's there and and Murphy's under, you know, I hate that." I go, "Murf, we're in a meeting." He goes, "It's okay. It's okay." So when Murphy says, "Okay, it's okay." and everybody else. Well, I don't know about that, but Murphy, he he's got it all together. So Murphy afterwards said to me, he said, "Brother Tom, they want me to come to Iraq." I said, "I don't." They said, "We want [laughter] you to come to Iraq." I SAID, "WHY WOULD THEY WANT YOU TO COME TO IRAQ?" HE SAYS, "Because we've been on FaceTime meetings, Mike, sort of video meetings, and these brothers are interested in the message." And they he said, "We we sent you a one-way. we sent you a ticket to come to Iraq. And Murphy texts back, make sure it's a return ticket. [laughter] That was very clever. I said, I wouldn't have thought of that. I'd still be in Iraq. So, he gets there and here's this brother that has been interested in the message. And Murphy being Murphy dumps the whole load about the message, the prophet, the opening of the word, the whole 1100 tapes, and in an hour and a half. [laughter] And and the fellow SAYS TO HIM, "I GET IT." Murphy goes, "No, he didn't. Nobody [snorts] gets it that fast." He says, "So he does it again." He says, "I told you I GET IT. GOD [screaming] SENT A PROPHET. &gt;&gt; You got it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So then then this gentleman always wanted to have a radio station. So he goes to the head of communication in an Arab Arabic, you know, Iraq and Iran and you know the whole situation regarding the Christians. takes Murphy there and God gives this brother a con or American or a station that we can preach the message on into Iran and Iraq. &gt;&gt; So I Googled where Murphy was and brother Brandham makes a me remember he says east meets west when west meets east in China east meets west meets east. He does that 10 times. But one of the 10 and says when west meets east in the Shinhar Valley and the Shinar Valley was where Abraham came from and where Murphy was. So the gospel has gone completely around the world. [applause] &gt;&gt; GLORY. GLORY. YOUR POPE, NOT YOUR POPE, &gt;&gt; AMERICA'S POPE, [snorts] &gt;&gt; CAME OUT OF AMERICA, &gt;&gt; prophesied &gt;&gt; 1954, &gt;&gt; A POPE WILL COME OUT OF AMERICA. &gt;&gt; AND EVERYBODY'S SAYING, "YEAH, did a pope come out of America? &gt;&gt; He certainly did. Came right out of America." Is that not correct? &gt;&gt; So now you got a pope out of America. got the gospel going around the world. &gt;&gt; Where are we? &gt;&gt; Where are we? &gt;&gt; Where are we? Incredible times WE'RE LIVING IN. &gt;&gt; OH, BUT YOU GOT PRESIDENT TRUMP AND MR. TRUMP. If you hear this, I'm not saying this against you. I know you mean the best for your people, but you can never make America the golden age. I might as well preach to you, brothers. &gt;&gt; You want it. You want your jobs. You want your new cars. And you want your new house. He said, "I'm going to make America great again, and it WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE." UH, that is from Solomon, actually. &gt;&gt; Wrong person. &gt;&gt; Boy, that really didn't go over so well. [laughter] Come on. President Trump, the best that he can do, is never going to bring you into a golden age. But I'll tell you, there's one man, &gt;&gt; AND THE MAN IS CHRIST JESUS, &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING TO BRING YOU INTO A MILLENNIUM. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; All right. So, we're going to a wedding supper, are we? And and and we've heard how many how many times we heard and he'll have a wedding supp. Have you heard that before? &gt;&gt; I think you have. Be be humble. Say yes. Okay. Okay. So, we've heard it, right? &gt;&gt; You try and find it. Actually, he says the wedding table will be a 100,000 miles long. &gt;&gt; Look it up. Fact check me. They all the kids do that anyway. [snorts] Thanks, Mike. Is it there? Oh, thank you. It's just so that you kids understand. The earth is over 24,5 how many miles around? So a 100,000 miles is over four times a round. &gt;&gt; So I went to AI. Sorry. Repent. AND AI SAYS THERE'LL BE 248 million sitting at that table. &gt;&gt; Oh my. I didn't get an amen on that. I got a chuckle from brother Ben. Can you imagine a wedding table 100,000 [clears throat] miles LONG FOUR TIMES AROUND THE WORLD 248 million sitting there I trust you have RSVP &gt;&gt; at the end OF THIS MEETING I WANT TO SEE ALL OF US HAVE AN RSVP AMEN I'VE ACCEPTED CHRIST. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE in his word. I believe this MESSAGE WITH ALL MY HEART AND I'M GOING IN A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; WHOA. I GO BY THE GRAVE AND I GO TO SLEEP. AND THOUGH I RAISE UP or get changed in the body, I've got a name at the table. &gt;&gt; That's not bad. Nobody asks, "Hey, I get parents coming to me. My son or my daughter are interested in soand so I don't have the money. Well, you don't have to worry about this one. 248 million [snorts] being able to sit at that table. And my Bible says he'll wipe every tear. &gt;&gt; That's my God. There is no God like my God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does he care for you? &gt;&gt; He absolutely cares for you. He sent a message to you in this sin cursed dying age that we're living in. To a people that you think that you're a nobody, but you're the greatest somebody that I have ever known. You are the bride of Jesus Christ purchased by the blood of the lamb and he heard your cry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And if he heard it and responded, he will respond again &gt;&gt; and again &gt;&gt; and again &gt;&gt; and again. &gt;&gt; Hear the cry of the broken. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I say he's heard your cry. &gt;&gt; We have an anointed word &gt;&gt; that has been vindicated through Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; But there's something you have to start doing. &gt;&gt; Believing. &gt;&gt; Now I'm just I'm getting wound wound up to to unwind. &gt;&gt; If that makes sense. You have to prophesy. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, &gt;&gt; but you're going to have to prophesy. &gt;&gt; Prophesy &gt;&gt; again. &gt;&gt; So, as we were closing the service the other night, we had a young brother preaching and I I I he was preaching on faith. And I said, "But faith is prophecy. &gt;&gt; Faith is prophecy." So when Abraham was asked to sacrifice Isaac before he went to the mountain, &gt;&gt; what did he say? &gt;&gt; The lad, &gt;&gt; and I &gt;&gt; shall return. &gt;&gt; He prophesied. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; Then John the Baptist did not KNOW THAT THE MESSIAH WAS HERE. But he was told that he would introduce him. &gt;&gt; So he prophesied &gt;&gt; and said, "There's one amongst you. &gt;&gt; I'M I'M UNWORTHY TO UNLATCH HIS SHOES. &gt;&gt; BEHOLD THE LAMB OF GOD." &gt;&gt; FIRST SPOKE IT. &gt;&gt; THEN GOD BACKED IT. &gt;&gt; SPEAK YOUR BODY CHANGED. Don't look at me. &gt;&gt; Don't Please don't look at me. Speak to me. &gt;&gt; I claim my new body. &gt;&gt; I CLAIM IT. &gt;&gt; I CLAIM IT THROUGH THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; HE CARES SO MUCH FOR ME. HE CALLED ME TO CHANGE ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I'm casting all my &gt;&gt; I know he loves me &gt;&gt; redemption by the &gt;&gt; love story. [singing] [snorts] That's &gt;&gt; testify. My redeemer's no longer dead. &gt;&gt; And he's coming back for you and me. Oh my MY MY MY &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [applause] Now people people got an issue. Let me just tell you, I know I'll be perfectly honest. I don't care. They're bunch of unbelievers. Oh, the cloud. It's a rocket. They need a rocket. They need a rocket to get out of here. &gt;&gt; But my prophet said &gt;&gt; when he saw that cloud up there, THAT'S CHRIST UP THERE. &gt;&gt; I'LL TAKE A PROPHET OVER SOMEBODY WHO READS SOME SCIENTIFIC MAGAZINE. NO VINDICATION, NO NOTHING. BUT MY [screaming] PROPHET SAID, "THAT'S CHRIST UP THERE." [applause] GLORY. &gt;&gt; That's Christ up there. The same God that spoke to the woman at the well. The same God who's wondered are too many to tell the same God. pardon. [crying] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; Is &gt;&gt; that's you know I'm watching you. the same God &gt;&gt; that parted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is you know we we say Moses was 80 years old, right? So [snorts] let's say he's 81 [clears throat] and he's um leading the children of Israel out. And Miriam is what nine years old or 10? Let's say she's 90. Let's just say JUST SO NICE. ANYBODY GOT A tambourine here? I need a tambourine. Ah. All right. Here we go. Tambourine. &gt;&gt; 91. &gt;&gt; Now I'm not 91. &gt;&gt; I'm 71. But when she saw Pharaoh, &gt;&gt; SHE SAW ALL THE [screaming] HORSEMEN, &gt;&gt; WHITE HORSE RIDER, BLACK HORSE RIDER, PALE HORSE [screaming] RIDER. WHEN SHE SAW THEM IN THE SEA, SHE DANCED. SHE REJOICED. [cheering] SHE PRAISED HER GOD BECAUSE HER ENEMY [screaming] WAS DESTROYED. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; GOD [screaming] CARES. &gt;&gt; OH MY. IF I HAD RHYTHM, IF I HAD RHYTHM, WE'D BE SINGING A FEW SONGS HERE TODAY. GLORY. &gt;&gt; 90 SOMETHING YEARS OLD. PHARAOH, RED HORSE, WHITE HORSE, BLACK HORSE. [screaming] PALE HORSE AND ALL YOUR ARMIES. &gt;&gt; You will see them. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SEE THEM. &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] WILL SEE THEM. &gt;&gt; GLORY. [applause] God bless you. Thank you for for a wonderful full weekend. I trust the word of God has helped you and STRENGTHEN YOU. GO FORWARD IN THE FAITH. &gt;&gt; GO FORWARD LIKE YOU'VE NEVER GONE FORWARD BEFORE. ONWARD, CHRISTIAN SOLDIER. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. MAN, I like this thing. [laughter] Hey. Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Huh? AND THIS [clears throat] I I IMAGINE David when he was having the victory dance and the word was coming back. That's what I feel this morning. I feel the word's coming back. THE WORD IS BUBBLING IN MY SOUL. AMEN. HEY. IS MICHAEL THAT DIDN'T LIKE his dancing? Huh? She was the one and God closed her womb. &gt;&gt; That's right. So don't you say, "Well, Tom's getting carried away. I'll get carried away." COME ON, DAVE. I'M GOING TO GET CARRIED AWAY WHEN I GET CARRIED AWAY. &gt;&gt; Put that down. [panting] God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] God bless you. &gt;&gt; Very simple. &gt;&gt; You got to stop listening to the devil. You've got to stop listening to the liar. &gt;&gt; He's the father of all lies and there's no truth in him. &gt;&gt; He said you never did it in the first place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I never did it in the first place. Now the liar &gt;&gt; has kept track of everything I've done wrong. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Since I brought the duck in the bed. &gt;&gt; He got it all wrote down &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Every mistake. And all he wants you to do is listen to him. &gt;&gt; That's right. You want to know what he said? &gt;&gt; Read your Bibles. &gt;&gt; Listen to the tape. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Remember this. &gt;&gt; You can come to the altar &gt;&gt; and you can pray and God it forgives you of your sins. But if you don't accept it, &gt;&gt; you're going to get up from there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You're going to go back to your seat. In five or six or 10 weeks, Satan's going to start telling you what a bum you are, &gt;&gt; what a failure you are, all the sins you do, all the mistakes you have, and he's going to convince you you're not what he said you were. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Where's the battle? &gt;&gt; In the mind. It's in your mind. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If God could give you anything better to fight Satan with, he would have done it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What did he give you? His word. &gt;&gt; Go take Rising of the Sun. &gt;&gt; Go take the Easter Seal. &gt;&gt; Read those books. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said it's not laid to your charge. Right? &gt;&gt; The seed of God was in you in the beginning. He put the wedding band of predestination on you over there &gt;&gt; before there EVER WAS A STAR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; He saw you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, what do you believe? &gt;&gt; That's our problem. Our problems is we listen to a devil and and we come to the altar saying, "I'm praying, oh God, that the devil never speaks to me again. That he doesn't bother me no more. That he doesn't I don't want the pressure. I don't want the lies. I don't want all the things he does. He's not going to leave you alone." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I like what brother Mike when he read that scripture. be sent to wear you out. &gt;&gt; And the only way you can be refreshed &gt;&gt; is to go back and hear what he says about you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you've got to believe one or the other. I told the sister, you can you're there. You're you're predestinated. Your name's on the Lamb's book of life. You can either live happy or miserable. &gt;&gt; But you're going to be there one way or the other. &gt;&gt; God said he's going to have a bride. He's going to have a bride. &gt;&gt; Nothing's going to stop it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know, two weeks ago, we sat right here and preached, "You are the children &gt;&gt; of prophecy. And we preach you take what he said. &gt;&gt; And that's the well man. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you walk into it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And you walk towards it and you believe it and it will come to pass. &gt;&gt; Brother Mike comes and brother Tom comes not knowing the thing we said. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And they say the same thing. You are the children of prophecy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're what brother Brandham spoke about. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you look at yourself and you say that's impossible. &gt;&gt; I had to look at myself. It was really impossible. But you know, he didn't have to do it. &gt;&gt; But he did. And you'll never be able to take it away &gt;&gt; because it was predestinated &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You are not earning your way to heaven. &gt;&gt; This whole thing's rigged. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's already been settled. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's a redeemer. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He came back to purchase his own. &gt;&gt; Now you someday you're finally going to have to say, "That's me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's the bride? &gt;&gt; It's me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Does Satan make my flesh miserable? Yes. &gt;&gt; But does he have victory? &gt;&gt; No. That simple. &gt;&gt; This is one of the best singing services I've ever had. I' I've never heard preaching with so much singing in it in my whole in my whole life. I thought that's the kind of gospel I like. &gt;&gt; A gospel that let you know you're somebody. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of being beat down all the time. You know, every morning I open my covers, I look up and there's the devil saying, "Oh, another miserable day, you miserable skunk." &gt;&gt; And I just sit there a moment. And I think, "Yeah, I'm a miserable skunk." But I'm a miserable skunk in God's hands. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to go out, Satan. I'm going to stink up your world cuz I I'm going to live for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. He has he tripped me &gt;&gt; lots. &gt;&gt; Have I got up lots? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is he going to trip me again? Probably so. Am I going to get up? Yes. &gt;&gt; The race is over. &gt;&gt; The battle's been won. &gt;&gt; We're a finished work &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Let our light shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. The musicians will come. Nick, I better give you. Don't worry, I won't turn into Isaiah Brooks. I I don't know how to beat one of these things. But anyway, give that to I think the sister that's yours is Sister Nikki. Amen. I want to sing that song. This little light of mine. I'm going to let it shine. &gt;&gt; Going to let it shine. &gt;&gt; God can do nothing for you unless you first confess it right &gt;&gt; now. I I can confess I'm a sinner. Prophet of God said if you keep calling yourself a sinner, you will [music] end up being a sinner. Right. &gt;&gt; But if you can say, "I'm a believer." [music] &gt;&gt; I didn't make myself a believer. He made me a &gt;&gt; I didn't see it. He revealed it. &gt;&gt; I didn't choose him. &gt;&gt; He chose me. &gt;&gt; I can say that with all my heart. I did not choose him. He chose me. &gt;&gt; And he said that if he started the [music] work &gt;&gt; that he would finish it. &gt;&gt; You say, "Am I finished?" No. I'm I'm not what I ought to be. &gt;&gt; I'm not what I want to be, but I surely ain't what I used to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it &gt;&gt; cuz I believe that I've come from God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I go back to God. &gt;&gt; So, how can you say that? The prophet of God said &gt;&gt; in the word of God that I was in his thinking. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How do you like this one? If you've ever had eternal life, you've always had it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's only one form of eternal life, and that's God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you were in him then. &gt;&gt; You are eternal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, it's hard to look in the mirror [music] and say, "You're eternal." Right? &gt;&gt; And you got this voice saying here, you're the you're this and you're that and you're a hypocrite and you're a failure and you got to listen to that guy. I have a choice. &gt;&gt; He said, "That settles [music] it." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; How? I don't know. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to be there. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to let that light shine. And I'm going to try to encourage you every service that I preach. Quit listening to Satan. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Start believing who you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect faith is when you believe what he [music] says you are. &gt;&gt; Jesus had perfect faith because he believed what the scriptures [music] said that he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can do it. I know of a man in the Bible. He just got to the place. He got so desperate. He finally looked to the Lord and said, "Help my unbelief." Believe, saints. Believe that you're [music] called. Believe you're chosen. Believe you're forgiven. I I just think the message that we've had this weekend to us is enough [music] to set our wings, don't you? You start testifying. &gt;&gt; People in the world don't know how have any hope. You're their hope. You're their light. &gt;&gt; You're their lamp. &gt;&gt; You carry their salvation. You can impart it to them. You pack the words of eternal life. Speak the word. Watch people saved and delivered. Are you going to let your light shine? Oh, I love I'm going to let [music] my mind [music] shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. [music] Oh, listen that second verse. Oh, don't let shake and [music] blow it out. I'm going to let it. Now listen. [music] Don't let shake and blow [singing] it out. I'm going to [music] let Oh, don't let it out. Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it [music] shine. No. [music] No. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Let it shine. Let it shine. Let it shine. &gt;&gt; Oh, this little light of [music] mine. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I I'm real acquainted with Satan. Yeah. I've been walking with him for 76 years. He lies to me every day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I know it going on in a lot of minds right now. [music] &gt;&gt; Satan's got all his list &gt;&gt; and he's reading it to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You do this, you've got [music] this. You've got that. Pick one thing. &gt;&gt; Not the whole bag. Pick one thing. Maybe one love story. Maybe one album. Maybe one game. Just go get rid of that one thing. &gt;&gt; Break that chain. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Get rid of that. Just one thing. Just take one thing. This is what I do. I I do this one thing. I have this one game I play. I'm going to go home and get rid of Sick Bird. &gt;&gt; I think that's a game, didn't it? Sick Bird. Who'd want to play a game called sick bird when you're a well eagle? &gt;&gt; Just pick something. &gt;&gt; Pick something to give back to Satan. Satan, you give me this. [music] I'm I'm giving it back here. &gt;&gt; You take this thing. &gt;&gt; And then next week you give him something else and give him out. You just start unpacking his suitcase. and you just move them right on out of your house. You don't have to do it one trip to the altar. It becomes a life [music] of unpacking him. You get home one day and he's like Amazon. Satan's like Amazon. He delivers something to your [music] porch every day. You say, "Who's sending me all this stuff?" Lucifer, &gt;&gt; you know what you do? You unpack it. &gt;&gt; You send it back. &gt;&gt; You send it back with the postage paid by the blood of the lamb. &gt;&gt; And you send it back. You start possessing the gates of the enemy. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [music] &gt;&gt; You start driving them out of your life. &gt;&gt; That's who you are. You have to go into the promised land and you got to push him out of the promised land. &gt;&gt; You believe you can do that? &gt;&gt; I believe you can do it, sir. &gt;&gt; I believe he's gave you the power to do it. &gt;&gt; I got no room for him &gt;&gt; in my life. We love you. We're going to have brother Billy come and lead us in a few songs of worship. And I [music] was told that I'm not good at leading worship. So, I need to turn it over to somebody who can, you know what I mean? And &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; uh I'm told I'm not good at preaching either, but I got to do something. So, you can either have me sing or preach. It's up to you. You vote on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; Where you at? &gt;&gt; Billy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love all these brothers. Don't you? And uh let's let's go forward. Do we have a path forward? &gt;&gt; Amen. I think we've getting a clear vision &gt;&gt; for what we want to do as a body. &gt;&gt; We want to share this word. We went our let our light shine and we want to start kicking the devil &gt;&gt; out of our lives and quit listening to him. [music] You watch what God will do. You can have what you ask for. &gt;&gt; That's the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; All our visitors, thank you so much. And and those of you that come here, let's be faithful. Let's try to be at church all we can. And I'm going to get on my soap box. &gt;&gt; Can I do that? Amen. &gt;&gt; Start coming to communion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And foot washing. &gt;&gt; Watch what it does for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, some glad morning. When this [music] life is over, I'll find way. Oh, and to [music] [music] my way [music] my way my &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. [music] Oh shadow of this [music] life is my way.

Blessed Lord Jesus, it's so difficult, Lord, at the end of meetings, Lord, to dismiss. It's hard to go our separate ways. It's hard to depart, Lord, from ones that we love so dearly. and we get just a few moments on this earth, Lord, to [music] be together and worship together. But Lord, we're so thankful that Lord, there is a place prepared for us, Lord. That Lord, this is only Lord, a moment where we'll part. But Lord, there's a place in eternity that Lord, we'll be able to sojourn. We'll be able to sit, Lord, for millions and millions of years together. Lord, we'll be able to share, Lord, all of our, Lord, our our stories, Lord, and how your amazing grace saved us, Lord. We we'll be able to spend time and time through into eternity together. So, Lord, this is where it's so important, these little times that we can be here in your presence to ensure us, but Tom said, let's make sure we have an RSVP to that table, Lord. And somebody, Lord, doesn't doesn't have that little, Lord, assurance in their soul. May they not leave these meetings. May they not go another day until they are so sure Lord that their their salvation and their calling and election. Sure. But Lord, we pray Lord as we would need to depart and go our journey and go home to our different places. I pray your presence would go with each one. Lord, as they're driving away, may they Lord be like them on Emmas, Lord, their hearts burning, Lord. Lord, knowing that you were with them, Lord, imagine that moment as they, Lord, pondered back and and thought, we walked all that time and he was with us and we we weren't aware of it until he revealed himself to us. But Lord, you've revealed yourself to us and we're aware that you've been with us all this time and we can go and our hearts burn and we can go to our different homes and Lord, just rejoice in what you're doing amongst us, Lord, and look ahead, Lord. Look forward and give us the strength and courage to press onward, Lord. Lord, I pray Lord you dismiss each one, Lord. Go with your grace with them, Lord. Lord, each one so precious. We love each one so dearly. Would your presence Lord overshadow us, Lord, we pray. Go in your grace and your love, Lord. In Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen.
