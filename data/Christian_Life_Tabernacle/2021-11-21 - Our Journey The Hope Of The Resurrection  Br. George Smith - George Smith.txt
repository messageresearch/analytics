Description:
Our Journey: The Hope Of The Resurrection
Br. George Smith
Sunday Morning Service: November 21, 2021.
Christian Life Tabernacle 
Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

open our service amen [Music] we thank you for that bread of life learn as you fed your five thousand father attended at you and to your disciples and you told them to go pick up the pieces that none may be lost that was scattered about father we've been scattered about we've gathered here together lord from all nations and all tongues populated you might pick up the pieces father that none of us would be lost we thank you for allowing us this time father for allowing us to be in your presence once again thank you for your grace and your mercies within our lives whatever the pieces are on the

in jesus christ's name amen [Music] let's open our bibles we're going to do a song reading this morning we have a few brothers that are out i'm sorry david wanted to have it and so he just uh said to jump in we're going to read out of psalm 117 this morning and you know i as uh i was just looking over this this few verses in the back you know it really brought to my attention the importance of and the grace and the mercy that we have from the lord by this message and how if we didn't have this message we couldn't see what the truth was and we know that truth is righteousness and so as brother david was even preaching on wednesday night you know sirs we would see jesus if it wasn't for the prophet to come and bring that to us for us to catch the revelation to see who that was we would probably put our own definition on it we would probably just you know interpret it in our own way just like everybody else does outside you know this message and so but we had a voice we had the son of man ministry that came and so when that word was brought forth just like it was in the days of jesus now this this word is being tangible between the bride and she's able to manifest the truth and so as i was reading these two verses is a very short chapter i try to choose a little one but it spoke to me just as i was reading in the back how we have to give them praise for this you know when you find your identity when you find the righteousness and the truth that god reveals to you that's all you can do that's all you want to do and so um we praise them so let's just read chapter 117 of psalms as we just read together o praise the lord all ye nations praise him all ye people for his merciful kindness is great towards us and the truth of the lord endureth forever praise thee lord amen

father to just come and pray for the needs this morning how many of you can you say that he's a possible god if we think how things are possible then we use our faith to move forward and believe in these things and so we just have faith this morning expecting on him amen [Music] the sun in the morning rises because of your word lord luna lord the moon reflects the same thing we are here because of you lord jesus [Music] we're here this morning lord to just ask for these causes and these needs that were right before you to bring them before you this morning this morning lord in the name of the lord jesus christ any sickness lord to be touched any any any burden lord to just be delivered any pain lord to have a deliverable asking the lord and we're raising the torture in the name of the lord jesus christ this morning that you bless the church we ask all these things now in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen i shall sing this down from this [Music] my god [Music] oh oh this

sons and daughters of god and receive eternal life lord if we only knew the true value and the true measure of eternal life what it really means oh our hearts would bubble over with praise and thanksgiving we ask you to bless us this morning father as we approach this holiday of thanksgiving father our thanks goes to you lord jesus and we ask you to bless us this morning in your precious name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated this morning just a quick announcement there'll be no service this wednesday evening no service this wednesday evening so that you can make your pumpkin pies and your pecan pies and remember to save me a little peace and that would be wonderful so the next service will be sunday morning november 28th so as everybody understand that no service amen we had a a baby dedication this morning and it's uh so jonathan and hope yesterday are going to dedicate their baby jonathan zion so i hope you're here where you come there they are [Music] [Applause] come on right up here [Music] how are you so mary ann's your grandmother and my dad oh hey how are you doing good good now i don't know i don't know if you're the brother that leslie delivered is that right all right so my wife delivered this man stand up so done a good job so uh this is marianne's uh great grandchild and marianne came out of california with us she was in our commune and we were hippies we were christian hippies and and so thus we were trying to leave for out of california and we didn't have a lot of money so we prayed and the lord gave us life and now we're having a baby dedication i hope you're marianne i hope maybe you're listening or this might be recorded but it's hard for me to believe that now we're dedicating the great grandchild so that's wonder a little scripture came on my heart and it it's found in samuel and the 20th chapter in the 41st verse and it says and as soon as the lad was gone no the i'm sorry this is the 42nd verse and jonathan said to david go in peace for as much as we have sworn both of us in the name of the lord saying the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed forever and he arose and departed and jonathan went into the city the great story of jonathan's testimony is a great testimony of loyalty of love and loyalty and how that jonathan chose to do what was right in the face of all obstacles or all political situations and everything and they bound uh oath together that god would always be between them and so i that's my prayer this morning is that god is always between little zion's life here jonathan zion's life and god will always be between his life and everything that he does so it's just wonderful to have this day and it takes me back that i'm dedicating great grandchildren of people that i know but god's life goes on all the yeskies that are here says yes god bless you and everybody this is just a wonderful time so uh brother once you come up let me ask you yeah come on up i want you up here to pray bring your wife with you amen and grandma you come to you yeah i want you up here i want the family amen come on we believe in dedicating families it's wonderful together as well all come together come on up here we'll all pray together this is a great a great day so god bless you sis good to see you again all you great soldiers to the cross god bless you so this is a wonderful family that's been dedicated this message for a long time so what we normally do is we just have the father pray and then we'll all pray together amen lord come for you this morning lord thank you for your love your mercy and your grace lord we come for you this morning lord we're dedicating our my little son lord to you lord to put the fear of ammunition on him lord and of the way he needs to go lord and help us lord to be good christian father and mother to him lord and as he grows up lord just be with him lord and just guide us lord and guide him lord in his path of wherever he goes lord and whatever happens lord we just want to be with be with him lord and we dedicate him to you lord thank you for it in jesus christ's name amen amen our heavenly father as this family comes together dedicated to you father believing in the word of god for this hour the grandparents father the great-grandparents lord just the joy that we have knowing that your love is passed down from generation to generation and that your word has remained true and father that there's those that you are giving us now if you would carry that would carry this banner father that the love that david and jonathan had for one another made this family and little jonathan's love be that strong together father may they always be bound together in love may the word be the banner that's held over them father without compromise lord god and and i love jonathan's testimony that he would not compromise father on the word even though his father stood against him he stood for what's truth may this spirit be with his whole family as we dedicate this child and the whole family to you in jesus wonderful name we pray amen amen good to see you [Music] i think it's wonderful hallelujah hey man you love the lord [Music] amen well it's wonderful to have brother george with us today and we're talking maybe tonight that he could uh preach in spanish and all we've got to do is find an interpreter so we will do it or you know he can preach both in spanish and english at the same time so i don't know what he'll do but i haven't been able to figure him out in all the years that i've known him but the one thing i do know is he loves the word and he loves the scripture and his life's always been a wonderful testimony and he's always tried to share this message everywhere he can so let's stand together this morning let's sing amazing grace as we invite our brother to come and break the word with with us this morning [Music] you know the prophet of god said that in every age god had an allotted word for that aid and so i believe that he doesn't change he's the same yesterday today and forever and once you find his pattern that pattern remains every age every time every situation if anybody approaches them on the same ground they'll get the same result amen so i believe god's got a lot of word for us this morning amen he didn't say how it would come or who would bring it but he's got a lot of work he knows who would be here and what each of us need this morning so as our brother comes to break the word of life to us just remember that god's got something for you but he only comes to them that are looking for him so don't let the word pass you by this morning just listen close and listen for your name and i believe god will bless you this morning let's sing it as our brother comes amazing grace amen [Music] grace [Music] i was [Music] i was [Music] [Laughter] amen and praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god [Music] praise god [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] praise god praise god [Music] good morning it's good to be here with you you never know when i might show up but i'm driving through to arizona to be with family for thanksgiving and so we couldn't go can't get arizona without coming through dallas and uh brother david's made me very welcome and it's always good to see all of you spend this morning we're going to speak a subject our journey the hope of the resurrection and i was kind of debating between this and another message and then the quartet got up and sang those songs that just pushed me in the right direction elijah says in the token message preached right here in dallas god's big clock ticks perfect it won't be one minute fast or one minute behind it'll be just exactly on time on schedule and perfectly balanced you can depend on it it's not something we made up it's just truth open your bibles over here to first john it's way over there by revelation yeah some people don't know that first john chapter 2 and verse 28. getting close first john chapter 2 and verse 28 and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming if we know if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it does not yet appear exactly what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure let's look at the lord in prayer precious heavenly father we're so thankful to be here in texas one more time we thank you for all those that have made the right choice and come out to the house of the lord and many who are wanting to be here but maybe for different circumstances have to be watching over the screen and pray that you bless them anoint them lord wherever they are may your word go forth and be a blessing to every person that's listening we thank you for your word we thank you for a true word of prophecy that we have that we can follow we can step into it with confidence help us now in jesus name amen you may be seated now all through scripture you find things like in the year of jubilee in the year that a certain king died in the month in the day sometimes very specific dates other things we don't know what date but we're only here to remind you of what a prophet has said and we're going to quote from different prophets so don't get too excited here we got it all together all you do is pay attention and so um on earth we live by a calendar we live by a clock we we have certain things we have to meet that'd be a certain place a certain time and um everything that ever has been you know everything that is and everything that will be is governed by the word of god now we forgot what we were doing at noon friday we don't know where we were six o'clock saturday morning that's all passed it doesn't matter you can't change that and we're here to prepare for whatever is coming because we don't know that either we have plans but we're living now so don't worry about those past don't worry about the future we're living now and so god's word comes to us by word of prophecy because god spoke he speaks the prophets and this that we call the holy bible is our roadmap okay it's our book of instruction our book of directions and some of you that are as old as i am uh yeah i'm older than the pastor in case you didn't know but um we used to have a map book you know and had all the states in there so if you're going to california from here it wasn't just the next one after texas it's alphabetical order so you had to flip through the book and find your way to get there let's see we've got that solvent that we have a different way and so um god has sent us a vindicated prophet to make the way clear you see modern events made clear by prophecy and so here we are in in 2021 going into 2022 who would ever guess that i can remember when i thought wow we ever get to the year 2000 wow that'll be a real real change well that's history there's some of you here weren't even born in 2000 you know and so we can't go back we can't go to the sides we've got to go forward because the clock is ticking it's ticking all these cute little girls they grow up and then they leave home you know cute doesn't last forever but you know on some people but everything we do is time sensitive right yeah it's time sensitive you know that the restaurant is open and i promise to let you out before lunch but everything is time sensitive so as the tick as the clock ticks by we need to make serious preparations for this journey okay the scripture says in revelations 19 7 that the bride has made herself ready she's not sitting on the porch waiting for the check she's busy doing things get up early go to bed late you get things done you know and to get ready there's four things you want to keep in mind and these are all things that that even you can do yeah everybody can do certain today and to make ready one is that you read at least one chapter out of your bible now that's not on the phone it's not on the tablet you open your bible and you turn the pages and you read out of your bible it's important you don't just listen to scorpio listening you know you read it number two you read at least one page out of the church age book uh-huh i still have the challenge out there i want to see the first person that's ever been hurt by that book in any language now there's some detractors out there we've got to have them got to have those people but if you don't have a church age book we'll talk after church number three you listen to at least 20 minutes of the prophet's message now every day it won't hurt you i mean i've been out in this traffic too and that's a great time to put on tape listen because you screaming isn't going to help those people move any faster and you can pray at all times okay and you even pray for those that hate you yeah that's what the word says so you want to fulfill the word you want to say what he says pray for those that hate you brother brahm says prayer changes things changes death to life prayer changes sickness to health how many can raise your hand no that's true yeah see god is alive you want to know where the miracles are look around right here and so um it changes sinners into saints some were out there doing bad things here they are and you know in relation to that i just saw a testimony this morning on my phone brother sent me you've all heard of mr el chapo right he used to be a real bad boy but see in god's books sin is sin so it's not because somebody was a worse sinner no sin is sin but he's come to the lord he's believing this message and he's in solitary confinement and he's not getting out and our government is prejudiced because they're not letting preacher get in to see him so this little sidelight anyway prayer changes sinners to saints now you can laugh too much and uh you can eat too much you shout too much but you can't pray too much no it's not possible paul says in first timothy 2 8 i will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath without doubting so um we will never be able to pray too much so these four items that i've given you will bring peace to your home it'll settle things you see and all you've got to do is stay in tune with the heavenly father and prepare for rapture that's our job you see and so today every one of us is on a journey okay we're on a journey to the gate of the resurrection that's our next stop this next thing that's going to happen and so um but there's many distractions along the way now you all been on these nice highways forgot right there's all these restaurants and and hotels all kinds of things on the way but we've got to get there see starting tonight i'm going to be going towards flagstaff arizona well it's 15 hours there's a lot of reasons to stop no i'll have some munchies and i'll just keep going but i will stop to rest but there's things along the way that distract us and we've got to keep focused now like i said we used to have the map book and you know hopefully you got somebody with you can flip the pages and find where you're going well today we have the uh the lady that speaks to me on the phone yeah and guess what she can see through the clouds she can see in the dark it's amazing god's positioning system he directed it there's 26 satellites up there that can tell everybody how to get there and so it's a voice on the on the dashboard there that takes us in the direction we want to go and if there's a wreck they'll show me how to get around it i mean it's amazing now god's word operates the same way you see so we have a hope of the resurrection it's like a magnet it's pulling us there and as believers in god's word we come from a long line of travelers okay so we have brother abraham for example he traveled about 500 miles from haran down to hebron and his journey was characterized by faith he had faith because god spoke to him he'd never been there god directed him he didn't have a cell phone but god was directing him now eleazar retraced the same 500 miles to go back and get rebecca it's in your bible in genesis and he was accompanied by an angel and his journey was characterized by success then we have many years later we got joseph and mary and they traveled about 60 miles from bethlehem to bethlehem obeying the law not getting an exemption not because on this no they obey the law that's what make this country what it is and they travel under difficult circumstances and so they they went because it was time for the taxation now yes she was very pregnant she was only you know nine months pregnant and rebecca always said that when she got to heaven she was going to find mary and ask her mary what on earth what are you thinking why didn't you take some clothes why don't you take some things for this baby you knew you was going to have baby you're the first one in the world and you had nothing you had to get the thing off the rack the swaddling cloth and put around him so i'm sure she already found her but you see they traveled under difficult circumstances and god's clock was ticking there's no shortcuts there's no excuses and there's many more in the bible but the most difficult journey was taken by jesus christ our lord he began up in caesarea philippi that's the northernmost point that he went and that's in matthew 16 that you'll find that he traveled about a hundred miles down to jerusalem you see and um once he got down there he went from the temple in jerusalem across the kidron valley over over to gethsemane okay it's about 600 yards and then once he's arrested back to the house of caiaphas across the valley again about 700 yards you just think this is all on foot they didn't have no suv no they walked and then over the pilot's judgment hall condemned without a proper trial and then 500 yards over to calvary as a convict so all of this less than a mile and a half and there they crucified him for you no matter where you come from no matter who your mom is who your grandfather is christ died for you okay and so um all of us are the purchase of calvary the predestinated seed throughout seven ages so our journey is today from dark laodicea that we live in to the gate of the resurrection just imagine those doors back there's the gate of the resurrection and we're we're inching that way now there's going to be obstacles but we got to get there because there's something in here pulling us you see and um the question is are you ready well we're gonna see about that or do you have things that yeah but i gotta gotta change my clothes and i gotta put my other shoes no we're ready to go you gotta go now see and so can you endure what's going on and uh we do live in dark laodicea now the prophet speaks over here and speak to the rock 1953. now we're getting we're going to talk about a journey how that god brought his people out of egypt into the promised land a perfect type of leaving sin coming into the spirit land and there's three stages to that journey one israel over there in egypt number two israel in the journey and three israel in palestine which is a perfect type of one justification by faith coming out you know good people living in sin but god bringing them out and then number two sanctification is to pass through the blood on our journey somewhere and number three the baptism the holy ghost or we enter into rest any questions so far you pay attention okay good because i did bring the level uh-huh you wonder how it's going to come out but it's got two purposes one for you to watch that i stay level but the other if i see anybody nodding off so he says that's perfectly the three stages of the church where this church is staged now he spoke that a long time ago see the church like this one is like a hospital everybody's not on the same level we've got to have little patience with people now it's not the deacon's job or the pastor's job or anybody else to decide who gets to stay and who gets to go no it's the holy ghost well speak the word you didn't know i was going to be here you didn't know i didn't know what i was going to say but the word will decide who gets to stay and get well and be raptured and who has to leave the word will do that so we're here today coming out we're in justification others are going through the blood you know through the process of redemption sanctification others are resting in the holy ghost we're in different stages of the journey but we all form the church of jesus christ in our journey from here to the gate of the resurrection i don't repeat too much but if i do it's because somebody's not paying attention so we're marching forward we're making progress now a message redemption and completeness 1954 now we're moved by the holy ghost in going now into the promised land quote in my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so i would have told you i go now to prepare a place for you now we have a promised land that we're going to he promised we're on the way okay and each day marks a milestone the clock is ticking okay and um he says another day another milestone and there's a big dark shadow out there before us it's called death some have already gone into that rest we're still here there's a line in the road and nobody knows where that line is for you but you won't go past that line i don't care how much oatmeal you eat how much broccoli and how much you stay away from chocolate you can't go past the line it's there see every time our heart beats we move one step closer to that line one of these days is going to take its last beat we're going in i want to be at my time make my lot now that's kentucky english for be ready okay as i hope every one of you is today when i know that it's lying there just before me and i have to meet it i don't want to be a coward i want to wrap myself in the robe of his righteousness walking into it knowing this that i am sure that i know him in the power of his resurrection that when he calls me from the dead i'll be called out with them that's living god is god of the living okay so for those that are already buried that book is closed they can't make any more changes but we're still here you see at another place god hath provide god has a provided way 1956 i imagine when the ages roll on he will just still be getting better and better all the time when we look back and see how god has brought us out brought us through and brought us into the three stages he says the christian life is a journey yes it's a pilgrimage you see and we're just passing through this land and we're not going to stay here many times we build a house and we say well the family you know now we can anchor down this is ours it's paid for and so forth but for how long you don't know and we always would like to get to a place where we could just say this is ours for good like secure but it isn't here on earth that place isn't here we don't have such a place but there's something in you that calls out for such a place and before there could be anything in you calling for such a place that place has to be in existence or there'd be nothing in here to call for it i mean this is pretty simple english you know so the deep can't call to the deep unless there's a deep to respond so it has to be that place first to make this deep call for it another place communion 1962. he's in prayer here he says now we want to keep under the blood at all times we don't know just what might happen all things are about wound up yeah clear back in 62. that's coming up a long time ago we feel lord that the coming of the lord is at hand we're fixing to take a journey and as we think of a journey we might think of suitcases and extra clothing extra shoes but how different this journey is it's not packing up it's unpacking laying aside as your great servant paul said in the book of hebrews 12th chapter we may lay aside every weight of unbelief that so easily besets us might run the race with patience the race that is set before us so don't be accumulating stuff give it away have a yard sale we're leaving so on this journey we have three kinds of believers now we don't want to think that but you know which kind of believers you are i'm not here to judge you but you know which one you are now if i could be the little fly on the wall and listen to your conversation at lunch then i can figure out which one you are but you see the word is preached to all evenly we don't discriminate and the church is a hospital okay so the make-believer and the unbeliever they're just along temporarily they might look like a believer they dress right their hair is right and they're just here temporarily they're they're enjoying the free ride soon they will have to jump off they can't go the distance you see they can't take the pressure they can't take the responsibility of the word now it's nice to come here a nice building can have another one lord willing and you know it's heated or it's air conditioned you're comfortable i don't get too comfortable because i might slam this down but you see they don't take they can't take the pressure of the word they can't take the responsibility of the word that they hear every service people just like to come here and kind of you know get cozy with the crowd and maybe someone will even might meet his lunch and on i don't know we're here for a reason we're here to make ready see now these people these make believers and unbelievers they look like believers and uh they try to act like believers impersonators and um and they can quote the word well they'll tell you right now you left off of the and you left off the at thank you wondering if he's going to catch that you know but they can't live at 100 it's just it's just in the head you know so don't waste your time trying to mark people and judge people okay god knows whose are his he knows exactly who's who and his only you know when we get to the wedding supper it's not going to be like this where there's some empty chairs every chair's got somebody in it nobody's gonna be standing around the wall i wonder where my chair is no no it's all taken care of you see so he will take care of the separating uh he'll take care of giving out their rewards he doesn't need your opinions he doesn't need the help of our little canary brain so the believer he feeds day and night on the word right he doesn't just read the one chapter or the one page he gets into it you know and um uh the believer loves the word it's his life source along the way and uh he stays in tune he stays in the atmosphere and he stays balanced when something goes a little bit wrong oh got to get back you know you're lucky you're all awake it's good so the bible says in romans 3 23 all have sinned that's all the my gary kids all the branhams all the smiths no aaron all the people in lumumbashi everybody all have sinned and come short of the glory of god so we're not born perfect another little baby that was here looks perfect but the scripture says born in sin comes to the world speaking lies and you mothers know that you don't have to teach them to lie it just comes automatically hardwired you know and in john 3 we begin to get a glimpse of the three kinds of believers verse 16. for god so loved the world pope what's his name francis he loves that verse oh god loves all yeah all those that come short of the glory of god he loved them all and he gave his only begotten son because it's only solution and then at that point they have a choice whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life so there is hope for the believer those that make the right choice now you could have been at the lake i came across it the other day beautiful lake yeah beautiful weather but you choose to come here to see what god has for you you see and so god knows exactly what he's doing now um to get to some unfamiliar place let's say that you're going to some little point up in oklahoma you know you have to look at the road map you have to see how do we get there you know might have to detour and so forth but now we have the electronic map you see and the voice to guide you in the natural and we have a voice in the spiritual to guide you god has given us five ministries in the church yeah it doesn't just say and i'll send you the prophet no i'm gonna send you all these one different ones in church and they work together in harmony okay somebody's somebody stayed up too late last night so um this is so that we can stay focused on the journey okay god drew the lines he highlighted certain verses promises for each age and when the believer like you comes to earth then we study the map and certain verses pop out because it's for our time you know and then we know where we are we're never lost and we recognize where we are in the plan of god so you recognize the signs around you and he will quicken the truth to you we're not building an ark today no we're not trying to find how to walk to california no we're trying to find the door of the resurrection get out of here god bless us along the way he gives this word to follow but he is going to take us out of here one of these days so he's provided a voice of the prophet to guide us along the way and of course we all have we're all humans we have some regrets wish you hadn't done this and done the other and we can't change the past but we can repent and ask for the blood of jesus christ to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and keep us shielded keep us balanced okay as for the present god gives us breath for today to live make decisions that will affect our future okay so you know what mistakes you made in the past and that was a learning process if you keep repeating that mistake then might be something wrong with your destination you know so we don't repeat mistakes mistake is one thing but if it continues then it's a habit and you got a problem you know so that alerts you to the fact that you're anointed with an evil spirit and you have a besetting sin and we have a solution right here in the word of god but you have to drop it all you have to submit you see so you need to ask for prayer and repent get yourself under the anointing under the influence of god's word you have to put yourself into a correct spiritual atmosphere the bride has made herself ready the rest of them don't care okay um so in today's lesson we're going to attempt to remind you of the truth brother brandon said very simply you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe right and they're in many languages and they're available on every cell phone on the planet the scripture and william branham's message is on every cell phone so brother brown warned us about television well i'm warning you about this little guy you get your fingers in the wrong place demons come out and take over be careful so as the bride um those that are traveling you know on this journey here in 2021 um we would all do well to listen carefully and quietly to the tapes in our home where he can speak to us quietly because you can get in here well i wonder what they think you know that's why a lot of times i see brother david he's he's very unique i mean we all know that but you see i asked him have you ever sat with your wife in church well yeah a couple times but see he's back here where nobody can see him you see a lot of times pastors sitting over here and i'll say something well they look bad you know see what he thinks no just listen to the word amen yeah me and david we get along real well um where are we at here um but we we listened to the tape we listened to what brother brown said because it's our our food for today you see and he says read your bible pray get in the cool room and listen yeah all this is in the tape so according to philippians 4 7 we can have peace that goes beyond the understanding goes beyond the criticism goes beyond all the religious fanaticism legalism and will keep your heart and mind through christ jesus that's what the word does for you okay also paul wrote over here to the church in rome in chapter 8 verse 16 the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that shows a unity that we are the children of god and if children then we're heirs heirs of god joiners with christ if shall be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for i reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us now he did take the 20th century prophet he took the restoration prophet over there he came back and he told us about it and that whole business of the beyond the current time that's one of my favorite verses you know but um that the glory will be revealed in us not only in christ will be the glory be revealed not only in the prophet but in us you and me flesh and blood believers in the 21st century that manifest hebrews 13 8. so as we take this journey we have ups and downs we got delays sufferings rejoicing setbacks victories it's the minister's duty to encourage us and to remind us and keep the people focused on the present truth now on the internet we have people that they worry about all kinds of things just this week they were worried about these are ministers from different places and so they said well you know mary was at the upper room but where was joseph i don't know it's not important it's focused on the present truth the scriptures that pertain to our time you see now in the message discernment of spirit very important message 1960 march the 8th and we are here this morning father gathered for no other purpose but to know and to study to know rather the will of god and what we must do to make christ real to the people of this generation that's the minister's one job to make christ real to the people's generation knowing surely that in the day of the judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation now these are words he's speaking in prayer but to the ministers we're going to face our people face to face and being ministers we will be judges and the people to which we have spoken to and their attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their eternal destination that's why i want to keep you awake pay attention might be something here you didn't hear before you see therefore lord in that day we will be a judge for or against the generation that we preach to now when we travel all of you've traveled nobody's now back there where i live in the hills of tennessee there's people that they never got out of the county i mean here's a guy 40 years old he's been you know 30 miles this way and 20 miles that way and i'm going to get my car fixed and i tell them i'm going to california or arizona wherever wow it's a long ways high 40 goes right straight over there so when we travel we got to make preparations right we got to check the schedules we got to plan ahead because god is not the author of confusion see everything is right on schedule so in the message his wonders to perform god in his great wise providence moves every cog to just hit at the right time these nice cars we have out here perfect machines all you gotta do is turn the key put in gear go anywhere you want but there's pieces that are moving you know it all works perfectly so god is wise providence makes every cog hit right at the right time and that gives us faith sometimes we when we think oh everything's topsy-turvy there's no way out of this don't think that god is making it work just exactly according to his program he's never late he knows exactly what he's doing so we have we have stories in the bible well jonah the lord of terrorists will have church tonight and i'm gonna i'm going to notice who's not here send you a bill but we're going to talk about jonah tonight lord willing we have moses it looks like he was out of a way out of out of sync no god was watching every step he's 40 years in egypt became the the main teacher at the university of cairo and then god got his attention you know and so um he um brother rem says here in the great servant moses after taking the situation in his own hand he found out that he was a total failure now he climbed the ladder while he was right there at the one step from power and he ran from the presence of pharaoh and ran from the presence of god it was a stranger over there for many years 40 years and he married an ethiopian girl and before we get too worried about that they were all pretty well tanned over there okay so don't worry about he it was okay god smiled on him and so she had a temper a lot of temper that wouldn't be you would it no had a lot of temper and moses had a lot of temper now we got some fireworks that was his trouble and i just imagined things weren't so peaceful back there on the backside of the desert many times but god gave it to him god was in the process so whatever you're you know with your husband your wife god has allowed this god is going to give you peace he's going to see you through you see in other words it was tough and maybe you know not always pleasant but it was god's program psalm 46 10 be still i'm god i don't need your opinions i need you all things you figured out i'm god see so brother and says if you think you married a woman that has a little temper maybe god's trying to tame you down a little bit and vice versa i mean it covers all of us now moses had been raised in the palace i don't know if you guys know anything about you know the way things run but in the palace they don't have to dress their self they don't have to make any decisions they just stand there and they put the clothes on them they put the shoes up they don't they don't make any decisions if they snap their fingers while everybody stands in attention so that's the way he was raised in the palace okay and so now after these 40 years there now he's out here in the desert and they're living in a tent on the desert where the wind blows and so uh zipporah sister zippy will call her her job was to keep cleat to keep the tent clean you know and and he's out there with the sheep now sheep are very mild-mannered they're lovely little creatures but they stink and so so moses out there with his sheep all day long and he comes home and she's trying to keep this tent clean and first thing she said now moses take off your shoes now see nobody ever told him that in the palace no no he did what he pleased and that was every day you know so one day he's out there with the sheep and god you know the clock's ticking and he came right to that time when he's going to get his attention so he's out there and there's a bush over there that's on fire wow what is that so he gets a little closer and he gets a little closer and when he gets right up close enough to the bush the voice comes out of the bush moses take off your shoes let's see he'd already heard that house god is preparing him you see so he said what was god doing schooling into the man's mind mighty prophet moses schooling into the man's mind what the program of god was through a high-tempered wife god has ways of doing things but all the prophets were humans they weren't god they were humans so brother abraham says now moses was back there waiting hurting the sheep in the desert perfect picture here before us tonight a believer out of fellowship with god now we already covered that there's three kinds of believers right i don't know which one here who's the might believer and who's the unbeliever but you know who you are don't worry about your neighborhoods take care of yourself okay so he's out there out of fellowship there he was no fellowship not one thing that god did for him in 40 years any supernatural he was out of fellowship and the church gets at when the church gets out of fellowship with god miracles sees signs and wonders sees revival cease god moves right on when you get out of fellowship the thing to do in other words to remedy this situation is keep the love of god in your heart so if you see something you don't like just thank you lord because your trial could be a lot worse just keep the love of god in your heart you see keep in fellowship with him and he will add these other things as we mature yeah now this kid here would probably like to have you know keys to the car that's not going to happen as we mature god gives you what you need and he gives us revelation as we need you know as we needed as we mature so moses had a fellowship no fellowship out there in a strange country among strangers not his own people she was ethiopian he was a jew and they're completely out of the reach of god seemingly and god all the time knowing that no matter how much of a mess man makes out of the program of god god's going to straighten it out that's the hope for today when we see things wow this and that and all these opinions god has a way he will straighten it out okay okay next time good up here okay so as we travel we got to be aware of the proper dress code yeah so it's a joy to come into church like this where everybody is dressed right most of you combed your hair you know it looks good now there used to be a difference when you travel on the airplane that you could tell the difference between men and women it's not possible anymore you know hairstyles people used to dress up a little bit maybe not a tie but at least look nice not anymore they show up in pajamas everything else on the airplane you know and now lately we've got a big argument about about which bathroom to use well every airport's got the one with the dresses okay all people's dresses go in here and all people's pants go over here it's all figured out now if you don't qualify there then you go outside [Applause] okay the way of a true prophet in phoenix and usually prosperity causes sin many people look on prosperity as blessing it would be if we could handle it right but it usually leads to sin dishonoring god and how israel had drifted onto the into the terrible sin got away from god got away from his commandments and his precepts and had gone all together off on a tantrum now maybe before you come you don't know what tantrum is well here when when you see the mother or even the grandma in the walmart and she's got the five-year-old with her especially this time of year and the five-year-old wants this either this particular cereal or this toy or whatever and she's not in the mood to buy it no then he's in the floor and he's screaming that's a tantrum see yeah says here the women walked in the streets and they're fine immodest clothes yeah they're doing that today because satan is the designer you see god made you short tall you know however you are that's god's design for you but satan fills the stores and he designs some of that clothes to make the man lust so you got to be careful so back then he says they walk the streets and they're fine in modest clothes the man went about gambling and drinking the road houses as we would call it today place of amusement wide open in the city yeah you ever been by las vegas up here it's open all the time 24 hours a day and you get in there there's no windows there's no clock you're in a world by itself well that's kind of what it's talking about here sin was disregarded by the ministry just wide open a beautiful place a great center for tourists and it lay wide open sin wasn't rebuked from the pulpit no more it was on the loose that's the kind of world back there it's the kind of world we got today so one thing that satan has accomplished here in laodicea better than any other time in history he's erased the lines of distinction we can't tell the difference between men and women anymore they've all kind of blended in you know and uh the the dress code the actions the jobs william brano had a few choice words for that tommy rot perversion sodomites because satan is erasing those lines to make it comfortable you see now let's be careful how many rocks we throw at the denominations down the street because i already checked it out you're right here between two baptist churches i was raised baptist that's where i learned to read the bible i'm not saying what they are but let's be careful how many rocks we throw at the denominations and the ladies in system when some of you permits your daughters and sons to dress the way they do take care of your place you see now i know children can be you know a challenge but they must live your convictions until they have convictions of their own okay if they're gonna enjoy your groceries and in your furniture and your air conditioning well then we've got rules you know that's right yeah so i know anyone's at the end time now friends this is a very important message when brother brandon preached this in july of 65 i was a young man had lots of hair thin and i was sitting like from here to that organ that's how close i was when he was preaching that and she went over my head but he says here he says whether we're methodists baptist presbyterian pentecostals what more we're all the same we're not the same you're a separated people holy unto the lord dedicated to the word of the word and to the spirit of god to bear fruit of his promise of this day somebody's going to live the promises of this day it's not just words on tape you know and he says and you're not one of them i know that's awful strong but it's the truth just the same you're dedicated to a service in this day come out from amongst it i don't care how real it sounds how much they impersonate it's a lie if it's contrary to god's word of the hour i don't care what it is if it's contrary to the written word of god of the hour it's a lie god will have nothing to do with it no matter how sincere how educated how smart how true it sounds how reasonable it sounds if it's contrary to the word of this hour now according to paul uh the ministry must be properly equipped for this journey okay let's look at second timothy chapter three here's paul preaching to timothy he sent him a letter and where are we at here in second timothy chapter 3 and verse 16 says all scripture okay that's everything in this bible that god has brought to us and we've had this bible since early 1600 all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works that's how the man of god that stands in the pulpit must be prepared you see and for this journey we also got to have proper papers now you all know about papers everybody that's born we assume has a birth certificate proving when you actually arrive and then some go on to get a passport they have to have passports going to go into another country and um but to travel to difficult places you've got to have a visa stamped in your passport so because our natural birth is a birth certificate born again it's the passport and the baptismal holy ghost is the visa now when we go to beyond the curtain of time in the rejected king 1960 he says here and i heard a voice then that spoke to me that was in the room now remember in this vision he sees his body laying there 20 feet away he's up here in this vision he can see both both dimensions and he says the voice was in the room this is what you preached was the holy ghost this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it i am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to get there my precious friend my beloved my darlings in the gospel my begotten children of god listen to me your pastor i wish there was some way i could explain it to you there's no words i couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing you ever saw there's no way to explain it there's no way i just can't do it but whatever you do friends lay aside everything till you get that perfect love get to a spot that you can love everybody every enemy everything else that one visit there has made me a different man i can never never never be the same brother random that i was a few months later he's telling the same thing up in klamath falls washington and um just remember i'll say this with the faith that i have in that vision or whatever it was and i'll speak in the name of the lord except you have perfect love you will not be there um because nothing can enter there without it your spirit would be out of place my friends you old people young people you don't know what time you're going to leave if you check the obituaries in the sunday paper if they still have one they didn't all die at 95. there's kids there's all kinds of people in there so you don't know when you're leaving we don't know but let me persuade you as a christian brother one that loves you except you're born again and the spirit of god and loves except you're born again and the spirit of god and the love of god comes into your heart you'll certainly miss that place so we have the formula which got to do it the bride has made herself ready so we make preparations we have the proper dress code properly equipped proper papers and one more thing got to be flexible because whatever plan you make it might not work you know they might delay the flight the things can happen so there's a precise schedule only god knows the details of the schedule now everything's right on schedule we you know we get excited we want to no just relax read the first three pages of questions and answers on the seals it'll help you a lot so we get zealous we come up with private ideas interpretations we figure out we make plans but one thing for sure god will fulfill his word right on schedule every time you see and there's no room for fanatics or legalist and along our journey we're going to face a lot of temptations yeah all kinds of things trials pitfalls but the word says in hebrews 4 that we have a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities because he was tempted at all points like we are but without sin so we're going to press fast forward here and jump around a little bit so his mercy and his understanding extend to every part of the journey there's no part of it that he doesn't know about okay the word tells us the mercy of god is to all generations even to ours we're tempted but we have an advocate and we can come boldly into his presence and ask for help you see seek his mercy it's like an oasis that's why we're here this morning it's like a refreshing you see we're not victims of our environment we're victors we're overcomers you see we're more than conquerors in christ jesus our captain said in revelations 12 they overcame him the enemy by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony so we all have a testimony of some size you know so our journey we become restless we become critical and bad attitudes come up yeah in every car full of kids that happens the farther you go the more restless and where's the promise of his coming all things continue the same since brother brown left i'm getting tired of the pastor always preaching right at me a lot of griping and complaining and don't smile i know that you're humans and that happens so the thing is you're bored you've got too much free time you got to go back to the four steps bible church facebook listen and pray your life will be better better atmosphere in the church too so if we would spend that same time reading the word and praying for others maybe there's needs in this church i mean you got all kinds of people there's people laying at home in bed right now in fact i was going to mention brother sanders was going to come today with his family but the wife got some kind of pain while she's in bed couldn't come but the boy i know you thought he left he was in the hospital for five months preparing for a very important operation because that boy's got spinal difficulty and he's 21 now and he's been through three very critical operations one was 12 hours long they put some rods in him now he can sit up straight he's on the way to getting walking so keep them in prayer so there's people to pray for you know and there's there's things that need to be done so if we spend our time in prayer in the word the trip will seem shorter and it'll improve our attitude and um we'll be in better condition for the journey so along the way we see signs that tell us how far it's going to be how close are we to the destination you know when i left texarkana the other morning coming this way you know one sign whatever it is 150 130 miles away then there's no more signs then when you get down a little closer okay there's a sign now there's another one they get closer together now i could i could stop there and and camp out at that sign but i never get here so we're now interested the signs just tell us that we're getting closer you see and so we gear our expectations to the signs because we know about how long it's going to take to get there and we know if there's time for a nap a meal or uh get our shoes on comb our hair you know the children get restless in the back seat yeah i raised three kids and they're tearing things up and popcorn stuff everywhere it makes you nervous but when you get within a few blocks of grandma's house oh now we're almost there kids straighten up be nice put on a happy face in other words be the little darlings that grandma thinks you are so it's time to get serious we're about ready to take off and some people aren't even dressed yet it's terrible but the holy spirit is not short-sighted okay our god can see the entire journey because from the prophetic realm everything's present tense you see so he can see the whole thing from the beginning to the end and god can see through time and space he knows all about the fuss as you had this week he knows if there was peace in the car coming to church or if you were giving your husband a try silent treatment yeah it happens you can get the coffee you want it whatever you know so god can see all this and you can see what's going to happen next sunday also so all you got to do is pay attention stay in step stay in the rhythm of the word and you'll get there you see he sees all he knows all he knows the secret thoughts you have and the devil sets traps along the way be careful laodicea is a like a minefield and your attitude towards god's word this morning um and towards god's messengers determines your destination it doesn't matter if you can quote it a lot of people can quote it over here at the baptist church they're quoting it but they don't have the revelation see so character is not a gift it's a victory indicating that there's things to overcome see so peter was very rough mary was very mild both still had things to overcome both had to be in the upper room because character is not a gift no matter what your name is so we prepare for the trip and we have expectations of the reunion when we get there we'll see our loved ones and we'll be on this earth for a month or so that's part of the gospel in the new testament remember when we preached on book of acts he was with them about a month they got some things solved and then he left well in our case there's going to be a rapture there's going to be first is resurrection then rapture and so uh since we're curious people then we're going to wonder well did so and so make it so god solves all that in that month or so then he takes us up to all our attention beyond him so god has arranged it in such a way that he brings our loved ones to us just before the trip just before the end of the trip just before we get to the resurrection he brings our loved ones to us he told one brother he said now one of these days you're gonna be in your house and you'll hear a knock on the door of course you go check it out there's your wife there's your mother whoever that went on years ago then you know it's serious you see so we have this time for greetings time for fellowship and then he takes us all to his house and we're in love with him god is a jealous god that's one of his names jealous okay and um so as we are on this journey we long you know along there we meet others that are on the same journey you know god sends visitors by here from somewhere oh you're one of us yeah and so um we because we know the prophetic message because we know the scriptures we have a lot to be accountable for you see we've seen many signs we've seen signs where we're all getting closer together and there isn't far to go we're almost there it's a great pulling like a magnet you know and we're of one spirit baptized the same way god is taking care of his people you see so some may think that oh i sure left a lot did you compared to what you're going to get no no in luke peter said look here we left everything to follow you you know jesus said verily verily i say unto you there's no man that has left house or parents or brother or wife or children anything for the sake of the kingdom of god who shall not receive manifold more in this life and life everlasting it's worth it people you can't leave too much so as we finish here this morning we don't try to keep you two hours but just enough to to make you go dig go find the rest of the story you know and we we know there's probably visitors but this is for everyone all you people looking on the internet this is for you too this is something that you can you can touch you know and if you're sitting here and you're hearing some of this for the first time and you want to get on this journey with us we can help you that's why it crosses up there to remind you that's where you start your journey so let's stand together it's good to be here it'll be good to be here this evening lord willing but if the spirit of god is knocking at your door don't let it go another minute because god has given you an opportunity to become part of this journey he's called you for that and it's very very serious christian heavenly father we thank you for your word we thank you lord for bringing us together we just pray that the word may find a resting place in every heart somebody will be encouraged to walk closer to you to be in step to be in tune help us now we ask in jesus name amen it's easy to forget that we're going somewhere isn't it it's you know one of i guess the greatest uh things in traveling is the great detour or what we call the wrong turn or you miss your exit you know i remember when we first started they start putting this express lane in and we get on the express lane and you know couldn't get off of it you know what i mean and then you're way away from where that you're going and and we had to learn every express exit every tricky way they did it every reason they put a bend in the road to make you get on it and so you know the journey is not without resistance you know what i'm saying so that's what i think brother george has you know really given us an admonition if you're not totally conscious at what's at stake then all the little foxes get in there and all the little things that you let gel go and all those loose ends and and then to them you know then it starts polluting your decision making you know you get soft and then you know you you're not sharp to make the right decisions and the right choices so you know and i think that's the overall purpose here is if we're here so that we can make the right choices that we can make sure that we're on the journey that's our upmost goal is to make the rapture and it's not us planning the trip it's letting him plan the trip for us through his word he'll speak to us day by day a little while in the world shall see me no more but you shall see me amen for i will not leave you comfortless but i'll come to you again and i'll send you the comforter and he shall lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness and i think that's what we've got to ask ourselves this morning is the spirit of god leading us and guiding us in all truth and righteousness are we in tune with that spirit have we got our lives and he gave us some secrets this morning to get in tuned read your bible amen that puts them on your mind right listen to listen to some tape right the church age book is the history of the church and it's the prophecy of the spirits working in the framework of the church so it will expose to you all the spirits that are working against us a tremendous insight and what's the greatest pray those four things because the we've got to have a consciousness of the fact that we're supposed to leave here and and i and i i really feel in my heart that's what satan's trying to do give us amnesia make us numb make us not alert get us to the place that we don't think things matter it doesn't matter anymore you know i mean it's sad isn't it when in our country people can just go into a store steal stuff jump up and it's not even a crime it shows you that there's an atmosphere changing the mental the mental working of people's minds is now being seared with a hot iron because they no longer wish to retain god in their consciousness and so you see the warning this morning do you know maybe not running from this side of the platform to that but we're not built on emotion we're built on the solidness of god's word plow word plow you can build something with word building blocks you know when all the sweat's gone and everything's gone and all the emotions gone and all the labor's gone what remains the word the block so you know so this morning let's reinvigorate ourselves let's refocus our purpose let's realize no matter what's going on in the world with entertainment and everything this rapture is coming the door we're going to the door of the resurrection we want to get to the place that the resurrection is going to happen you understand and and you know and i i say it in myself many times the rapture is not a time it's a condition that you come to the place that you're in rapturing condition you come to the place that you're at the door of the resurrection waiting right there for that door to swing open and it's going to be too late to try to run to get there so what a beautiful thought really to bring us all into remembrance that we're not living to stay we're living to leave this message is not a staying message to teach us how to live here and be happy it's to teach us how to leave here amen how many want to leave amen i want to go home don't you amen let's bow our heads together again and and then maybe we sing that little song i like it so much i'm thinking of a rapture but let's just take a moment and bow our heads and each in our heart just come before the lord in our own heart we each know our own life we each know how much time we're giving to the word of god we each know what's been pulling us astray we know many of us are in places in our life where we have relationships and we've got to determine is this relationship taking me to eternity or is it pulling me away is my job leading me closer to god or is it pulling me away i certainly don't want to miss the rapture i have a book i can sit down and read that god can speak to me i speak to him in prayer he speaks back to me through his word [Music] i seek his face and because he's a counselor a prince of peace and a mighty god and he promised that he would lead me and guide me you know if i have a great promise then i ought to seek his counsel [Music] ought to seek his face seek his advice [Music] maybe this morning you'd ask yourself have i really been seeking the advice of the lord have i been seeking his counsel and his leadership in decisions that is going to affect me and those around me [Music] i want to shake myself this morning i want to renew my thought process and we've been told in his word this morning not to worry about the wrong things don't worry about the things of the world [Music] but we want to take worry about our condition and our soul and place it in the palm of his hand this morning heavenly father as we approach you and my hands lifted father before you then [Music] it behooves us to become so much more aware of the life of your word in the life of the resurrection and the door of the resurrection and not let this gospel become common or little to fail to give regard to our decisions and our lifestyle and to make an effort father to bring everything under the leadership of your word in your spirit this morning father we set our hearts back and shake ourselves lord i can't forget i'm on a journey i can't forget i do not belong in this world i can't forget i'm not from here lord i'm not from here this is not my place i want to go home lord shake the voices away from me the pleasures that are being offered father let those great eagle wings blow over my nest today that i might fly and soar into the heavenlies i ask you to deal with our hearts this morning and lord jesus if there's one here this morning that doesn't know you that they haven't heard of the sacrifice at calvary and the blood that you shed for our sins that we could go free from habits we can go free from depressions and and sickness that you've come and you've you've brought all things into your hands well there's one that hasn't accepted you this morning and your spirit has dealt with their heart may in their spirits say lord deal with me if there's one that's never been baptized this morning in real biblical bible baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sins that they might receive the holy spirit father we ask that you deal with their heart that we'd examine ourselves as i have i done this right have i done this according to the scriptures have i done it god's way father may we be conscious of a journey there has to be a way you can't make the journey without a way and you said that you were the way the truth and the life and no man cometh unto the father but by you this morning we ask ourselves father do we have you and our challenge from this pulpit this morning through the message that we've heard in each of our lives do we have him this morning do i have jesus in my life has jesus taken control is jesus leading me this morning we ask ourselves that this morning lord lead me i pray give me strength and mercy to overcome i want you to be my guide if you'd like to lift your hand to him this morning and you'll be honest lord you haven't been my guide [Music] i've known you and i've known about you and and i have had all the word and the message in the back of my mind but i really haven't let you lead my life in a while and i'd like to lift my hand up to you now lord and say take that leadership once again this morning lord i've gone astray a little bit lord i've let the things of the world come in but i want to come back this morning and lift my hand and say lord i'd like to give my life back into your hands this morning i'd like you to take leadership once again i'm going to ask you to lead me father to the door of the resurrection hands raised heads bowed in hearts let us pray heavenly father those that have asked you to come back into their lives this morning those that have asked you to take leadership back in their life those that have seen there's been other influences come in and and a lot of voices speaking to their mind but they want to turn all those voices off and just listen to you this morning father we commit them into your hand this morning because you're here for them and your spirit is called many are called take heed this morning to the call we ask it this morning in the wonderful and precious name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen you know what's beautiful about having the lord in your life and accepting his leadership in his spirit you can think about the rapture hey amen help me sing it oh i [Music] of the am oh [Music] oh [Music] oh there will be [Music] oh [Music]
