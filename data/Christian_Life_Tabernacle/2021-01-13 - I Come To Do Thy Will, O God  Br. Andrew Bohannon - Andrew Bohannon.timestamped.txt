[33:01] afflictions of the righteous but the
[33:04] Lord
[33:17] [Music]
[33:27] just have a little thought that little
[33:30] bit been churning on my heart and we
[33:33] just trust that the Lord will have his
[33:34] way and will be able to deliver the
[33:37] burden we certainly have appreciated the
[33:40] brothers and the wonderful wonderful
[33:43] words we've been hearing I just so
[33:46] appreciate how Brother David you know
[33:49] just coming out of that theology you
[33:51] know we hear the word and the word
[33:54] starts having an effect and we start
[33:56] trying to put it in practice is but we
[33:58] need the spirit to come behind the word
[34:01] amen and so as we're journeying through
[34:04] the little bit of a thought that we have
[34:06] we just trust that the Lord will come
[34:08] behind his word
[34:13] amen Philippians chapter
[34:23] 3 we start there in um
[34:28] verse one finally my brethren rejoice in
[34:31] the Lord to write the same things to you
[34:35] to me indeed is not Grievous but for you
[34:39] it is safe beware of dogs beware of evil
[34:42] workers beware of con
[34:47] conscious concision for we are the
[34:51] circumcision which worship God in spirit
[34:53] and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no
[34:57] confidence in the
[35:00] flesh though I might also have
[35:02] confidence in the flesh if any other man
[35:05] thinketh that he hath whereof that he
[35:08] mightest trust in flesh I more
[35:10] circumcised The Eighth Day of the stock
[35:13] of Israel of The Tribe of Benjamin and
[35:17] Hebrew of Hebrews as touching the law a
[35:19] Pharisee concerning Zeal persecuting the
[35:23] church touching the righteousness which
[35:26] is of the law blameless
[35:29] my my that's that's a very high order
[35:33] there but what things we gain to me
[35:38] those I count loss for Christ that's
[35:41] right yay doubtless I count all things
[35:44] but loss for the Excellency of the
[35:46] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for
[35:51] whom I have suffered loss of all things
[35:53] and do count them but
[35:56] dung but I might when
[36:00] Christ and be found in him not having my
[36:04] own righteousness which is of the law
[36:08] but that which is through Faith of
[36:11] Christ the righteousness which is of god
[36:15] by faith yes sir that I might know him
[36:19] and the power of his resurrection and
[36:22] the fellowship of his suffering being
[36:25] made conformable unto his death amen we
[36:28] trust the Lord will add a blessing to
[36:30] the reading of his word you may have
[36:31] your
[36:33] seats you know you think about what Paul
[36:35] is saying there there's there is a a
[36:38] place where the believer is going to
[36:39] come to to to know him and to know him
[36:43] in the power of his resurrection and yet
[36:47] to know him you must also know how to
[36:51] have fellowship with him amen the Bible
[36:54] says here that the there's a fellowship
[36:56] of his suffering and being made
[36:58] conformable unto his death amen so as we
[37:02] we just we also will read in um in
[37:07] Hebrews chapter 10 Hebrews chapter
[37:23] 10 we'll start there in um verse four it
[37:27] says for it is not possible that the
[37:29] blood of bulls and goats should take
[37:32] away sin therefore when he cometh into
[37:36] the world he saith sacrifice and
[37:38] offerings thou wouldest not but a body
[37:40] thou Hast prepared me in burnt offerings
[37:43] and sacrifice for sin thou has no
[37:45] pleasure then said I lo I come in the
[37:49] volume of the books it is written of me
[37:52] to do thy will oh God Amen and I believe
[37:55] that's the same Cry of the spirit in The
[37:56] Believer to I've come to do thy will
[38:00] amen and there's a there's a call
[38:02] there's you know for the believer today
[38:05] is to know what our purpose is like our
[38:08] brother Billy was speaking you know for
[38:10] this cause have I come into the world
[38:12] you know it was to destroy the works of
[38:14] the devil and when God paid the price uh
[38:19] you know we we ought to consider what
[38:22] was the purpose why was the lamb slain
[38:26] and you know so that you know we can
[38:30] understand more about what the call is
[38:32] what the purpose of God in our lives
[38:35] right is it just to have a job and you
[38:38] know go to school and have a house you
[38:41] know and just kind of conduct life no
[38:44] God wants he has a purpose in us being
[38:46] here amen that's
[38:50] right you know it was it was in the mind
[38:53] of God it was in the plan of
[38:55] God that there would be a Union there
[38:58] would be a a a uniting and so you know
[39:01] when you consider the plan of God and
[39:04] God how he wanted to become with one
[39:06] with man and you think about the the
[39:09] enemy you know we know that it was
[39:11] saying there that you know there was
[39:14] dogs that would come you know there was
[39:16] there would be a a religious spirit that
[39:19] they would be cloaked with theology you
[39:22] know and they would come and they would
[39:23] be taking the very same word and and
[39:26] they would be walking down a line to
[39:29] where you know as the Bible says that at
[39:32] the end it would be so close that it
[39:35] would deceive the very elect amen but
[39:39] now what what is the dividing line amen
[39:43] so I want to see that this Same Spirit
[39:46] that was shed at Calvary because the
[39:49] life is in the blood and so when the
[39:50] spirit came out of life now he wanted to
[39:53] have a union and declare the very same
[39:55] works that he did amen and that was to
[39:58] destroy the the the works of the devil
[40:01] not just you know when you look out and
[40:03] you see the politic no it it starts at
[40:06] home it starts this is um where it
[40:09] begins Let the spirit of God come and
[40:12] destroy the works of the devil in me yes
[40:15] sir Amen in my in my thinking sir amen
[40:18] we're living in a time where it's like I
[40:22] mean there's a personal Temptation for
[40:24] each one of us you know we're we're
[40:26] experiencing in things we're going
[40:28] through things and even as the request
[40:31] it just when I consider it you know I've
[40:34] had four children and and I I know that
[40:38] the the the complexity that can be when
[40:41] when you have children and the birth the
[40:43] excitement and then there's it doesn't
[40:45] always just go as smooth as you would
[40:47] hope but yet when you see that child it
[40:50] gives you it propels you it motivates
[40:52] you and and you know the thing about the
[40:55] Life of Christ for us you know we're
[40:57] looking that God would have his way and
[41:00] the trials and the testings that we're
[41:02] going through is to bring about a
[41:03] Perfection it's to bring about a
[41:06] character amen sir and so you know as
[41:09] you're going through the test you know
[41:12] what we want to understand is whenever
[41:15] those birth pains get closer and closer
[41:18] and closer you know and they get more
[41:20] intense that means the Deliverance is at
[41:23] hand amen so the things that you're
[41:25] enduring the the com conflict that's
[41:28] within there's a wrestling you know
[41:30] there's there's that mind battle and
[41:32] it's real and it tries to grip you but I
[41:35] want to say that God is here he's come
[41:39] and in the power of his resurrection
[41:41] amen and he wants to do for us the
[41:43] things we can't do for ourselves it's
[41:46] just getting out of that channel of
[41:48] trying to figure it out and trying to
[41:50] get to manufacture something but that's
[41:52] not the call of God amen amen
[42:03] if we go over to Luke we're just trust
[42:05] in the Lord will lead us along we don't
[42:08] really have
[42:09] U necessarily
[42:12] um you know a straight line we want to
[42:16] we want to go through but we're just
[42:18] trus in the Lord will be able to speak
[42:21] something to your heart that would
[42:22] really encourage you I know we're going
[42:24] through Troubled Waters amen but there's
[42:28] the spirit of God is here to bring the
[42:30] stabilizers
[42:32] Amen in Luke chapter 4 you know we want
[42:35] to just kind of look you know the the
[42:38] people who have gone on have been
[42:41] examples the Paul Abraham Noah the
[42:45] scripture says that there were examples
[42:48] to admonish us to see that what pleased
[42:51] God and how you know you see how they
[42:54] responded you know because there's there
[42:57] there's going to be challenges that you
[42:58] and I face that the enemy is tempting us
[43:02] he's trying to draw us away and there's
[43:04] going to be there's going to be
[43:06] opportunity to to react to an action
[43:11] amen and you know you know how it is
[43:14] sometimes your flesh gets in front of
[43:17] gets in front and then all of a sudden
[43:19] you're now like oh you know Lord I just
[43:23] you know I missed it there try me again
[43:25] you know that's the mark of a true
[43:27] Soldier amen like when you're getting
[43:29] tested and you're getting tried and you
[43:32] fail there's something in you that says
[43:34] I can't lose amen you can't lose see
[43:39] when he died at Calvary you were there
[43:41] with him and he conquered death and hell
[43:43] and the grave and that was for you and
[43:46] you were in him amen and now you're here
[43:48] to express him amen amen that's right
[43:52] that's good that's wonderful am Amen to
[43:55] think that you were with with him there
[43:59] amen and now here in Luke you're
[44:02] familiar with the scene
[44:04] and something that was said just really
[44:07] just sparked off to me and I just trust
[44:09] that it'll be a blessing so it's start
[44:13] and it says and Jesus being full of the
[44:16] Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and was
[44:19] led by the spirit Into the Wilderness
[44:22] amen and that just strikes me you know
[44:25] the spirit of God LED him to be tested
[44:29] amen let him in so don't be
[44:33] surprised if you come LED of the Lord
[44:37] and you're in a test you're you you feel
[44:41] like you're in a desert land you're in
[44:42] the wilderness and you don't feel you
[44:46] don't feel the spirit moving you you
[44:49] know you feel anxious you feel tired you
[44:52] know you don't feel worthy don't be
[44:56] surprised
[44:57] when the Temptation
[45:03] comes being 40 days tempted of the devil
[45:07] and in those days he did eat nothing and
[45:10] when he were were
[45:12] ended he was afterward hungered and the
[45:15] devil said unto him if thou be the Son
[45:17] of God command these stones to be made
[45:21] bread amen that's just the same thing
[45:24] for you you're not a son of God you're
[45:26] you're not a daughter of God look at
[45:28] your life look what you did oh I you
[45:31] know that's just like the devil he goes
[45:32] hey take that take that and then he's
[45:34] calling the police when you did it you
[45:36] know that's exactly the way it works
[45:38] he's the accuser of the
[45:43] Brethren but he always tries to put a
[45:46] question mark on the word of God he's
[45:48] trying he he's that black voice that
[45:51] black dog and you got the white dog and
[45:53] the black that guy is telling you
[45:55] constantly he's got he's he's got that
[45:58] uh he's got that uh monologue he's const
[46:03] he's
[46:04] Relentless he he won't stop so you know
[46:07] what it's time to come in the power of
[46:10] the resurrection and tell him to leave
[46:14] amen I got a word amen it's it is
[46:18] written The man shall not live by bread
[46:21] alone but by every word of God Amen it
[46:25] doesn't you don't have to feel it
[46:27] you don't have to you know feel like
[46:30] singing none of those things but it's
[46:33] written
[46:35] amen that's right and the devil taking
[46:38] him up to a high mountain and showing
[46:40] him all the kingdoms of the world in a
[46:43] moment's time and the devil said unto
[46:45] him all this power will I give thee in
[46:49] the glory of them for that is delivered
[46:52] unto me and to whosoever I will give it
[46:58] if thou will worship
[47:01] me all shall be thine you know Jesus
[47:05] didn't dispute him that he had the
[47:07] Authority or the power over all those
[47:10] kingdoms and you consider that even
[47:13] today
[47:14] how you know that's what the enemy tries
[47:17] to do he'll offer you some kind of um
[47:21] position in a in a job or he'll offer
[47:24] you some kind of um you know
[47:27] you name it you know what it is I don't
[47:29] you know I know what he tries to offer
[47:31] me amen but there's nothing that's going
[47:33] to come in front of the word
[47:37] amen
[47:43] that's says and Jesus answered him and
[47:45] said get thee behind me Satan for it is
[47:49] written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy
[47:51] God and him only shalt thou serve amen
[47:55] so I just think about this and how that
[47:57] worship and service are connected you
[48:00] know and and I I feel there's a call to
[48:02] service I feel like the Lord's been
[48:04] really dealing with us about getting in
[48:06] action you know that it's we've been
[48:08] we've been
[48:09] training we've been in the barracks
[48:12] we've been learning how to to to conduct
[48:16] Our Lives you know we we we got the ABCs
[48:20] we're working and now it's time to open
[48:22] our mouths and tell somebody else that
[48:25] Jesus Christ is coming he's come he he
[48:29] he's changed our lives he's made a
[48:31] difference
[48:33] amen and he can do the same for
[48:39] others and and he brought him up to
[48:42] Jerusalem and set him on a high Pentacle
[48:44] of the temple and said unto him if thou
[48:48] be the Son of God cast thyself down from
[48:50] hence for it is written he' give his
[48:53] angels charge over thee to keep thee and
[48:55] in their hands they shall bear thee up
[48:58] lest at any time thou Dash thy foot
[49:00] against the stone and Jesus answered
[49:03] unto him it is re it is said Thou shalt
[49:08] not tempt the Lord thy God and when the
[49:10] temp when when the devil had ended all
[49:13] the Temptations He departed from him for
[49:16] a season and Jesus returned in the power
[49:19] of the spirit into gallilee amen and
[49:22] that that's that little verse really
[49:24] popped out at me I I don't know if it
[49:26] was brother Billy who read it but it
[49:27] just it struck me you know it after the
[49:31] Temptation even before the Temptation
[49:33] the spirit led him to be tempted and
[49:36] then he goes through those three
[49:37] personal Temptations and and brother
[49:40] brandham said this and I'll read the
[49:43] quote maybe I'll paraphrase it but you
[49:46] know the Lord never used any of his
[49:49] power to defeat the Devil you know we
[49:52] know that Satan can be defeated any time
[49:56] any place and anywhere and and he gave
[49:59] this example here so that even the
[50:02] weakest of Christians can take God's
[50:05] word and defeat the Devil amen and I
[50:08] think about that the enemy that tries to
[50:10] come in my mind you know you think about
[50:13] when you start looking at what goes on
[50:15] in the world you know what what's going
[50:18] on in the world is and I don't keep up
[50:21] with
[50:22] politics but I try to I try to notice
[50:25] certain things because there's a
[50:28] parallel right there's there's the
[50:31] natural and the spiritual and they're
[50:32] are working parallel they're coming
[50:35] along down the line and so now if you
[50:38] just look at and I won't talk
[50:39] necessarily Who's Who and all that stuff
[50:41] but as far as with a new Administration
[50:45] coming in there's going to be a new
[50:48] president that would stand in and and
[50:50] things are going to change you know we
[50:52] know it's coming and so there'll be this
[50:55] Administration and obviously they'll
[50:57] make this change and this change and so
[50:59] the rulership is going to be acting in a
[51:02] different way right so in the parallel
[51:06] now I want the the the power to return
[51:10] to the power of the spirit amen you get
[51:13] to serving the lord sometimes in your
[51:15] mind you start worrying against this
[51:18] Spirit of
[51:20] self-sufficiency Amen do do you
[51:22] understand that we're going through this
[51:24] life we're still packing a corrupt body
[51:27] that our spirit still needs to be
[51:30] changed we have the Holy Spirit and he's
[51:33] here to bring us to a place where we
[51:36] receive power of the Resurrection that
[51:39] it can bring this body this mind into
[51:43] subjection amen I am under an
[51:47] expectation my My Hope Is that the very
[51:51] Christ the very Spirit of the word will
[51:54] now become energized and make this body
[51:57] subject to every word amen and this body
[52:01] has been promised that it's going to
[52:03] defeat death the the power of death
[52:07] you're going to express the very living
[52:11] Christ that's what you're doing
[52:14] now that's what you're doing now in the
[52:16] face of all the tactics that the enemy
[52:19] is because now he's his administration
[52:22] is to rule by
[52:25] fear so you think about what what is
[52:29] happening in the day and age that we're
[52:31] living in there's a people that are
[52:34] crowning Jesus Christ Lord of lords and
[52:37] King of Kings how are they doing it by
[52:40] taking him at his word saying though in
[52:42] my body the skin worms are destroying me
[52:46] yet I see my Christ he he promised me a
[52:50] resurrection I don't have to taste death
[52:52] because he tasted it for me amen that's
[52:55] right SE words are not going to fall
[52:57] they're going to manifest in me amen
[53:00] that's the way you feel that's right
[53:02] there's something inside deeply calling
[53:04] out for the very Resurrection Life
[53:08] right to destroy the works of the devil
[53:12] in your loved
[53:13] ones Lord let me be submissive to the
[53:18] hand of the Potter so that I can be the
[53:21] very Christ a hand
[53:24] extended amen amen
[53:27] you're you're that tree you're that tree
[53:30] that's bearing
[53:32] fruit the fruit of life amen and you
[53:35] think about you know in the natural how
[53:38] that all of the systems and everything
[53:40] like that you know uh you know when I
[53:44] was going through a little study you
[53:47] know I'm I'm paraphrasing because I'm
[53:50] drawing off memory you know somewhere in
[53:52] the pergami or the Samaritan Church age
[53:56] where
[53:57] the church now you know the enemy he
[54:01] Rules by deception amen he's the God of
[54:04] this evil age and he he he comes using
[54:08] religious trappings I mean wow he he
[54:12] would take the word and even the name of
[54:14] Christ and and and yet it's so
[54:17] deceivable and yet so now uh the the the
[54:22] very the very organized religion now the
[54:26] way that the enemy is controlling from
[54:29] behind the scenes so now it's the system
[54:33] that's that's moving and carrying out
[54:37] his work amen and yet there's another
[54:41] system if you will there's another power
[54:45] that is now coming in a people that have
[54:47] been purchased
[54:50] amen that that they're crowning him
[54:54] amen I'm not going to be subject
[54:57] to to to um this corrupt flesh
[55:02] anymore you know I I was used I used to
[55:05] be in bondage this used to have Mastery
[55:07] over me it was it was a husband but that
[55:12] see now I've been made conformable unto
[55:15] his death this man has died amen and now
[55:19] there's another life it it's the Life of
[55:22] Christ it's no longer I that live but
[55:25] it's Christ that liveth in me
[55:36] amen you know I just think about
[55:41] um you know the
[55:43] witnesses that we had and you know
[55:45] brother
[55:46] brandham he he was preaching a message
[55:49] in 1962 called the present stage of my
[55:52] Ministry and I can almost remember the
[55:55] the very first time I heard it um this
[55:59] was when Glenn Parks used to live here
[56:01] and I was doing a job for John and uh I
[56:05] I just remember how that you know Paul
[56:09] in his life and we can go to uh I
[56:11] believe it's in first Timothy but you
[56:14] know you see the the the scriptures have
[56:18] have a double meaning and history
[56:19] repeats itself ever so often and you see
[56:22] that you know the things that you go
[56:25] through the things things that other
[56:27] people have been through the witnesses
[56:29] that have gone before us like uh Abraham
[56:33] and and so many strengths can come from
[56:35] their experiences and so I just think
[56:38] you know in this time you know when when
[56:42] we're forsaking our Humanity you know
[56:45] there's there's pools that we have and
[56:46] we're forsaking those things and there's
[56:49] there's a parallel where the world is
[56:51] forsaking anything that's called God you
[56:54] see there's a great contrast so as the
[56:57] world gets darker and darker and further
[57:01] away from God there's a people that are
[57:03] walking into more light amen I'm
[57:06] forsaking my own way I'm
[57:08] forsaking um all
[57:11] unbelief amen and so uh when you think
[57:15] about there's a there's a
[57:18] um we're living in a time it's a
[57:21] forsaking time but there's a crowning
[57:24] that's happening you know
[57:27] and and something that kind of uh just
[57:30] came on me and I'll just like I said
[57:32] with with with Paul in his ministry you
[57:34] know he was the the Gentile Prophet you
[57:38] know he never met Jesus Christ in the
[57:40] flesh he had met him when he had
[57:43] returned back in the form that he was
[57:45] before the in the form of the spirit
[57:48] right and so now um he he he lived his
[57:52] life he he he experienced a Great
[57:55] Commission
[57:56] and
[57:58] now there came a time in his life where
[58:01] all had forsaken
[58:03] him you know
[58:06] that maybe I'll read this quote and that
[58:09] I kind of settle down a little bit it
[58:11] says this he says now and this is out of
[58:15] the present stage of my Ministry um
[58:17] verse
[58:18] 44 he says now when Jesus the young
[58:22] prophet of Galilee he got a time that he
[58:25] was forsaken Aken all men who stay with
[58:28] God's word gets to a place where they
[58:31] are forsaken by the world and the
[58:33] religious world Amen and so you know you
[58:36] think about our Lord and he experienced
[58:38] that and then Paul came to a place and
[58:41] there was so much U miraculous I mean
[58:44] think about the the snake bite he shook
[58:47] it off in the fire think about how that
[58:50] you know so many mighty Works were done
[58:53] in his ministry and then when he came to
[58:56] the end of his ministry he said in
[59:01] um believe it's First
[59:11] Timothy second
[59:13] Timothy in verse uh in chapter 4 2
[59:17] Timothy chapter 4 he says
[59:22] now in verse six he says for I am ready
[59:26] to be offered in the time of my
[59:28] departure is at hand I have fought a
[59:30] good fight I have finished my course I
[59:32] have kept the faith henceforth is laid
[59:34] up for me a crown of righteousness which
[59:37] the Lord the righteous judge shall give
[59:39] me at that day and not only to me and
[59:43] not to me only but all them that love is
[59:48] appearing do thy diligence to come
[59:50] shortly for Demus hath forsaken me
[59:53] having loved the present world and is

[1:00:01] Titus and Dil only Luke is with me take
[1:00:06] Mark and bring him with thee for it is
[1:00:09] profitable for me for my Ministry am man
[1:00:13] you think about the story you know there
[1:00:16] there there's going to be a time of
[1:00:19] testing amen but but to overcome is to
[1:00:22] stand the test amen I just feel my heart
[1:00:26] that the the time that we're living it's
[1:00:29] a testing time brother brandom said you
[1:00:32] came to this world to be tested but you
[1:00:35] have the goods see the good gold when it
[1:00:38] goes to the to the to the inspector you
[1:00:42] don't have to be nervous because you
[1:00:44] know it's good it's good gold it's going
[1:00:46] to pass the test and and your new birth
[1:00:49] experience by the spirit of God it's it
[1:00:52] passes the test amen so yeah I think
[1:00:55] about the the thing that um you know
[1:01:00] anything in nature anything in the
[1:01:03] economy of God if we ever serve God's
[1:01:06] purpose we're promised a resurrection
[1:01:09] amen so we're looking for the
[1:01:12] resurrection amen that's our goal so
[1:01:14] when we're you know surely in work when
[1:01:18] you go to your job you you don't work
[1:01:20] for nothing you know I mean there's a
[1:01:22] reward there amen we're we're living
[1:01:25] this life we're enduring afflictions
[1:01:28] we're in battle we Face test it's not in
[1:01:31] vain we have the prize we're looking for
[1:01:34] the prize the the time is at hand amen
[1:01:39] let's run this race with patience
[1:01:45] amen there's a time that will
[1:01:48] come and it did for Paul and see the
[1:01:52] thing it just strug me you know it's
[1:01:55] it's one of those things things where
[1:01:56] you know in in the in God through
[1:01:59] brother Brandon was sharing how that you
[1:02:01] know Deus you know he was converted in
[1:02:05] Paul's meetings Paul led him to the Lord
[1:02:08] and now the scripture says that that
[1:02:10] Demus had forsaken him you know think
[1:02:13] about it I mean there's times where you
[1:02:15] shared things with people and where are
[1:02:17] they now you
[1:02:20] see he said Demus hath
[1:02:24] forsaken having love love this pleas
[1:02:27] present
[1:02:28] world my you know the scripture says if
[1:02:32] you love this world the love of God's
[1:02:34] not even in you amen I'm not speaking to
[1:02:37] you that's your lot but I'm saying
[1:02:40] that's what happens sometimes people
[1:02:42] still
[1:02:43] haven't had that burned out amen but but
[1:02:47] your example can bring the true seed to
[1:02:49] the New Birth amen H how how how did you
[1:02:53] experience this what was the result of
[1:02:56] that well you know what I'm not going to
[1:02:59] tell you the Theology of it but let me
[1:03:01] tell you one day I kneel down and I
[1:03:04] heard that Jesus Christ paid it all and
[1:03:06] when I believe that I took him at his
[1:03:08] word and not only did I leave it in my
[1:03:10] mind but I kneel down amen and I asked
[1:03:13] him I called upon the name of the Lord
[1:03:15] and let me tell you after that day I've
[1:03:17] been changed I'm a new creation just
[1:03:20] like the Bible says that all things are
[1:03:23] passed away the burden of sin is gone
[1:03:25] amen
[1:03:26] amen this is a
[1:03:28] reality it's the spirit that's come and
[1:03:31] resurrected me out of my own I'm my
[1:03:34] worst enemy he he still Wars against me
[1:03:38] he Wars against you he's trying to make
[1:03:42] the word which all that he was you are
[1:03:46] he's trying to make you of none effect
[1:03:49] because of the battle just sit at
[1:03:54] home I W go there
[1:03:59] you know it's in light of a crowning I
[1:04:05] um I wanted to consider what a crown
[1:04:08] represents and a couple of definitions
[1:04:10] that I I it's just kind of a blessing to
[1:04:13] me and that you know the crowning is
[1:04:17] representative of of
[1:04:19] sovereignty you know it's it's
[1:04:21] representative of a imperial power of a
[1:04:26] dominion and
[1:04:29] so it also re represents
[1:04:33] legitimacy and victory it represents
[1:04:37] honor glory it it it also
[1:04:42] represents
[1:04:45] immortality it represents righteousness
[1:04:48] and
[1:04:50] resurrection and it's also a crown is
[1:04:53] actually um something
[1:04:56] given to a
[1:04:57] champion amen don't you don't you don't
[1:05:00] you feel like your arms are starting to
[1:05:02] get a little strong to grab the crown of
[1:05:04] your life and Crown Jesus Christ Vicor
[1:05:07] he he's the winner of my heart amen
[1:05:11] didn't his love woo you to say oh you're
[1:05:13] worth everything amen you
[1:05:17] know there's a thing you know in this
[1:05:19] journey God hasn't made halfway
[1:05:22] Christians or halfway preachers right
[1:05:25] but we can be halfway amen we want to
[1:05:28] learn how to give
[1:05:30] all that's the very
[1:05:33] Victory so in light of this crowning you
[1:05:35] know I started looking at it how that it
[1:05:39] symbolizes you know in Traditions they
[1:05:41] can make crowns out of different things
[1:05:43] some make it out of Oak and you know
[1:05:45] they made a crown of thorns of mockery
[1:05:47] for our
[1:05:48] Lord and you know it was the very thing
[1:05:53] that was necessary
[1:05:56] to set us
[1:05:58] free you know he he did that it was a
[1:06:01] love expression you know and you know a
[1:06:04] crowning is also a
[1:06:07] coronation it it it symbolizes and it it
[1:06:12] the type of crown that it is it
[1:06:14] symbolizes what its aim is if it's gold
[1:06:17] or wood or different things and I
[1:06:20] thought you know the the the
[1:06:23] etymology of the word Crown is is an
[1:06:26] investment with with Regal power or a
[1:06:29] throne so it's representative of a
[1:06:31] throne and
[1:06:34] and a crown is also a culminating
[1:06:37] event okay these are just natural types
[1:06:41] and and a crown also can represent the
[1:06:44] top part of a tree and then it also can
[1:06:47] represent where the the root of the tree
[1:06:49] is and the stem so that's a crown and
[1:06:53] now
[1:06:56] a crown can also be something that's a
[1:06:59] prosthetic that covers your tube you
[1:07:01] know you think about some of that it's
[1:07:04] just uh it's just interesting
[1:07:08] but you know the the root of crown in
[1:07:13] Latin the word is actually Corona and
[1:07:15] and you just think about how that the
[1:07:18] enemy the way he's crowned upon the
[1:07:21] people is by fear and when you're ruled
[1:07:24] by fear you're ruled by Satan amen but
[1:07:27] we have the love of God which casts out
[1:07:29] all fear amen we're not afraid to be at
[1:07:32] the house of God to worship God we're
[1:07:34] not afraid to be at our job and declare
[1:07:37] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:07:40] today and forever that he heals he's
[1:07:42] alive he still saves he still delivers
[1:07:46] he still casts out Devils amen if you
[1:07:49] suffer a little bit for the cause of
[1:07:51] Christ amen amen amen but if we suffer
[1:07:54] as wrong ERS well that's you know that's
[1:07:57] part of being human you know but we want
[1:08:00] to yield ourselves to the power of the
[1:08:03] Resurrection that his Works might be
[1:08:06] declared Amen in our redeemed flesh amen
[1:08:26] you know there's there's examples like
[1:08:29] Paul there brother brandom said that
[1:08:31] there's there's a separating time that
[1:08:33] comes you know like we don't we don't
[1:08:36] walk this with our mom we don't walk
[1:08:39] this life with our dad there's a time
[1:08:42] where we come to the place where we have
[1:08:44] to meet God Alone amen amen and so we
[1:08:48] have to separate from all unbelief we
[1:08:50] have to separate from our kin all that
[1:08:53] right when we have our experience now
[1:08:55] now we can rejoice and line up in the
[1:08:57] army of God we're serving God together
[1:08:59] amen but I've had my experience I've
[1:09:02] been separated from all unbelief amen
[1:09:05] and
[1:09:07] now God is having his way
[1:09:12] amen you know demons got the wrong
[1:09:14] opinion you know I as I was reading this
[1:09:17] I just thought only you
[1:09:20] know only a prophet could really
[1:09:22] understand this but he said now when and
[1:09:25] I was sitting around uh praying and
[1:09:29] brother Brown says I wonder what Deus
[1:09:31] was
[1:09:33] thinking you
[1:09:35] know when when you know to to forsake
[1:09:39] Paul and he he was sharing how that one
[1:09:41] brother was like you know when we get to
[1:09:43] heaven you know I'm going to let Deus
[1:09:46] know why did he you know forsake you
[1:09:49] know he's going to you know give him a
[1:09:50] good lick and brother B said you know
[1:09:54] watch out your desire to want to because
[1:09:56] there ain't going to be that kind of
[1:09:58] thing going on in heaven you
[1:10:00] know so but it just it just in my heart
[1:10:05] I Rejoice because the word of God is a
[1:10:09] discerner of the thoughts and intense of
[1:10:11] the heart God has discerned our hearts
[1:10:14] amen and he's provided what we have need
[1:10:16] of and so he said now let's take some of
[1:10:19] dea's thoughts as I was sitting down on
[1:10:22] the hillside wondering the other day
[1:10:24] about daylight and I was thinking why
[1:10:27] would Deus want to leave that fell why
[1:10:30] would he want to leave that poor little
[1:10:32] preacher that led him to the Lord the
[1:10:34] man that spearheaded the Revival amongst
[1:10:36] the Gentiles a prophet indeed no one
[1:10:39] could say but what he was a prophet no
[1:10:43] one was more he was more than a prophet
[1:10:46] he was the Apostle and a Great and
[1:10:48] Mighty Apostle to the Gentiles and the
[1:10:51] spirit of God moved upon that man and
[1:10:54] why would he want to turn back to such a
[1:10:57] p turn his back on such a person as that
[1:11:00] he had been Vindicated he was a servant
[1:11:03] of Christ did you notice Paul his him
[1:11:08] saying loving this present world now I
[1:11:10] don't think Deus was backslid I don't
[1:11:13] think that he he did that but I think he
[1:11:17] got the wrong opinion of
[1:11:19] Paul so he didn't backslide he didn't go
[1:11:22] drinking and off into the world no he
[1:11:25] said he got the wrong opinion amen and I
[1:11:27] I want the spirit to
[1:11:29] so to to to so rule my heart that my
[1:11:33] mind won't drift into these other
[1:11:36] opinions amen because we're subject to
[1:11:40] to to having these things come at us but
[1:11:43] we know we've been equipped with a
[1:11:45] double barrel shotgun when the when the
[1:11:48] enemy throws those thoughts we got the
[1:11:50] Old and New Testament it start saying it
[1:11:53] is written amen it is written
[1:11:55] thus sayith the Lord get thee behind me
[1:11:59] Satan now Deus came from a rich family
[1:12:03] and he was wealthy and money sometimes
[1:12:05] is religion to
[1:12:09] people you know I just think you know he
[1:12:13] also started looking at Paul's life and
[1:12:16] you know think about it and you you'll
[1:12:18] face it and I've experienced it as well
[1:12:21] but you know you you speak of a
[1:12:23] supernatural God and no doubt you've
[1:12:25] experience the supernatural God cuz it
[1:12:27] it takes a miracle to receive Revelation
[1:12:29] it takes a miracle to be born again it
[1:12:32] takes the hand of God upon your life no
[1:12:34] man can buy his bootstraps lift him up
[1:12:36] into the kingdom of God it takes the
[1:12:39] spirit of the Resurrection to come where
[1:12:40] you're at yes sir when you invite him
[1:12:43] amen and so you think about how that
[1:12:46] damus had had loving this present world
[1:12:50] then he took the wrong opinion of him
[1:12:52] because now you know think
[1:12:56] about you know in light of what he just
[1:12:59] said about some people's religion is
[1:13:02] money you know and and brother Brandon
[1:13:04] was off Millions he just turned it down
[1:13:07] he forsake it you know thinking about
[1:13:10] our Lord he he didn't even have a pillow
[1:13:13] to to lay his head he forsook home so
[1:13:16] that you and I can have a home he says I
[1:13:19] go to prepare a place for you
[1:13:22] amen we got a prize yeah our hope is not
[1:13:26] here we're resting that he's made a way
[1:13:29] for us am so we think about how that he
[1:13:33] he started looking at things in his in
[1:13:36] his mind he perceived that Paul was
[1:13:40] starting to get washed up that his
[1:13:43] ministry he didn't have the same power
[1:13:47] amen and and
[1:13:49] now you know he he leaves his friend
[1:13:52] that's sick and then he goes to another
[1:13:55] another meeting you know a Divine
[1:13:58] healer leaves his friend and goes and
[1:14:02] then he also he writes unto him and he
[1:14:04] says
[1:14:05] now he said uh in verse 13 He says the
[1:14:09] cloak that I left with
[1:14:11] trus uh
[1:14:13] tros with
[1:14:15] carus when thou comest bring with thee
[1:14:19] in the books see he he said he only had
[1:14:23] one coat and he said it's getting cold
[1:14:25] up
[1:14:26] here you
[1:14:28] see you know I I just he started getting
[1:14:33] the wrong opinion thinking that wow he
[1:14:36] leaves his friend sick and then he's
[1:14:38] without natural reignment clothing and
[1:14:43] and now he's starting to think he's all
[1:14:45] washed up and
[1:14:48] yet I I want I want to be able to have
[1:14:52] the mind of God be my goal what is God
[1:14:56] doing in the trials that we're facing
[1:14:59] sir what is he producing what is he
[1:15:01] declaring yes sir what what what is the
[1:15:04] result what is my reaction to what God
[1:15:08] is
[1:15:09] doing am I
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:12] willing to suffer when people forsake it
[1:15:16] hurts it hurts people you love they're
[1:15:20] like you know what they just get the
[1:15:22] wrong opinion yeah amen but you know
[1:15:25] what for us we want to bear that cross
[1:15:29] you know it becomes the very thing many
[1:15:32] times they say how you stood in the
[1:15:35] midst of your trial I knew there was a
[1:15:39] strength there was a hidden strength and
[1:15:42] it draws them in they start hungering
[1:15:45] for what you have
[1:15:52] amen God was fixing to Crown his
[1:15:55] Ministry and you think about you know he
[1:15:59] said it was profitable that Luke was
[1:16:01] with
[1:16:02] me you know and and he always had that
[1:16:06] infirmity many people believe it was his
[1:16:08] eyes after the heavenly
[1:16:10] vision and
[1:16:13] um you know but God was fixing the crown
[1:16:16] his ministry and you know I just think
[1:16:18] about how that you know those things are
[1:16:21] patterns that we we want to be so
[1:16:24] subject to the spirit of Christ that
[1:16:26] when we Face the trials and God wants to
[1:16:28] Crown us with life that we're so yielded
[1:16:31] and we're so in the word and in the
[1:16:34] spirit of the word that he can Crown our
[1:16:37] lives with the resurrection life amen
[1:16:59] trying to look to see how much time I
[1:17:01] spent praise the
[1:17:03] Lord trying to find a place to stop
[1:17:07] here you know I I I was telling my wife
[1:17:10] you
[1:17:12] know I feel like many times because of
[1:17:14] the battle you
[1:17:17] you're you have the ability to get
[1:17:20] Negative amen anybody else feel like
[1:17:23] they've ever gotten kind of sour and
[1:17:24] kind of got a little negative and uh a
[1:17:28] thought struck me the last service and
[1:17:32] uh you know God loves controls the ants
[1:17:36] and and you know someone would say well
[1:17:40] you know God love doesn't care whether
[1:17:41] you got termites or not you know what I
[1:17:43] mean but but yet uh there's this acronym
[1:17:46] that brother Jackson shared with me one
[1:17:49] time that I was fellowshipping with him
[1:17:50] and you know that acronym is these
[1:17:53] automatic negative thoughts that's
[1:17:54] that's what ants it's an automatic
[1:17:57] negative thought syndrome you know
[1:17:59] that's the black dog that we have to war
[1:18:01] against it's our own spirit all Humanity
[1:18:04] it it wrestles against us right we have
[1:18:08] an adversary he's corrupted this and so
[1:18:12] we're going to stand Victorious because
[1:18:14] he's in US greater is he that is in you
[1:18:17] than he that is in the world Amen though
[1:18:20] these negative thoughts come I don't
[1:18:23] want to give vent to them yeah amen I
[1:18:26] want to say it is written I preach the
[1:18:28] gospel to myself every day sir it's so
[1:18:32] necessary that we lift ourselves up out
[1:18:36] of this the humanity part because
[1:18:39] there's so many influences bombarding us
[1:18:41] all of the sudden now we hear it so much
[1:18:44] we repeat
[1:18:48] it
[1:18:50] amen as I was just being too negative I
[1:18:52] said Lord I was telling my wife you know
[1:18:55] it's it's something that's within me I
[1:18:58] want to return to the power of the
[1:19:00] spirit yeah amen I I am come to do thy
[1:19:05] will oh lord it's the same spirit in you

[1:19:15] me yes you paid the price don't let One
[1:19:18] Promise fall to the ground don't let me
[1:19:21] live below my privileges not one more
[1:19:23] moment amen if you have a need if
[1:19:27] there's a desire in your heart let's
[1:19:29] call upon God and walk in the power of
[1:19:32] the spirit
[1:19:34] Amen brother Brown made this statement
[1:19:37] and and why was the Holy Ghost given
[1:19:41] for men and women where where do we
[1:19:45] stand today where are we at let's stop
[1:19:49] the other night across a little old seat
[1:19:51] where there in a room I must
[1:19:56] close a little old duofold seat after
[1:20:00] praying for three or 4
[1:20:04] days so I got into such a place going
[1:20:07] around thinking oh
[1:20:11] God and I got to such a place till I
[1:20:14] don't know what to
[1:20:16] do I I thank God for the examples amen
[1:20:20] there's times where we just get to a
[1:20:21] place where we just say I don't know
[1:20:22] what to do but bram's expressing this
[1:20:26] very
[1:20:27] thing he says God we are at the end of
[1:20:31] the road and I realize I've been
[1:20:34] neglected I've had calls to go on and
[1:20:38] been
[1:20:39] tired and wouldn't do it I thought then
[1:20:43] that I could see the Lord staggering
[1:20:46] through the dark Yonder when he was so
[1:20:49] tired he could hardly raise one foot
[1:20:51] after the another one
[1:20:55] but he wasn't to he stopped for the
[1:20:59] woman and
[1:21:01] name then for the boy brought out there
[1:21:06] that was dead till he could go out over
[1:21:10] and touch that barrier and use the
[1:21:13] little strength that he had to raise
[1:21:15] that boy well how did I get tired what's
[1:21:19] the matter with me Lord think here I
[1:21:22] think well I'm getting old I can't do
[1:21:25] it and there was Moses and the same God
[1:21:29] I serve stood Yonder at the at 120 years
[1:21:34] old there was Caleb stood at the age of
[1:21:37] 90 with the sword in his hand and said
[1:21:41] Joshua put this sword in my hand 40
[1:21:44] years ago he was 80 them
[1:21:49] said I'm just as good as a man today as
[1:21:53] I was then
[1:21:56] amen I said God be merciful to me I said
[1:22:00] well look at
[1:22:02] here I'm always and I took my wife back
[1:22:06] there by the hand across this Bible and
[1:22:09] her little Bible and I said honey I've
[1:22:11] been too negative the Holy Spirit
[1:22:13] condemns me within me I said I think
[1:22:17] about those squirrels Yonder I think
[1:22:19] about Hattie Wright back there and those
[1:22:21] little
[1:22:22] boys I think about what God did showing
[1:22:26] that he was God and could create
[1:22:29] Hallelujah I thought he told me that for
[1:22:33] years I I I'll not leave you nor never
[1:22:38] forsake you no man stood no man will
[1:22:41] stand before you all the days of your
[1:22:43] life I will be with you and from this
[1:22:47] hand of discernment it'll come till you
[1:22:50] know the very secrets of the heart after
[1:22:52] that it'll raise ra you up higher and
[1:22:55] higher and the years after that proved
[1:22:58] perfect the world around then it comes
[1:23:01] this that other great ministry far
[1:23:04] beyond it honey I've taken your hand and
[1:23:07] by God's help and Grace and I'll never
[1:23:11] never let me be negative
[1:23:13] again let me walk forth to the this
[1:23:18] revival here to preach like never befor
[1:23:21] amen let me go here to First sanctify
[1:23:24] myself and to make a way for the
[1:23:27] people that my that my own sins my own
[1:23:31] neglect be under the
[1:23:33] blood my own shortcomings be under the
[1:23:36] blood that I might walk out and say
[1:23:38] follow me people that's right I hate to
[1:23:42] see a guy you know and I'll just I'll
[1:23:45] just paraphrase I'm just kind of a slow
[1:23:47] reader but this story I I just encourage
[1:23:50] you to listen to it there's something
[1:23:52] that happens and if I prepared better I
[1:23:54] probably would have just had the
[1:23:55] brothers back there play it it's that
[1:23:58] encouraging but you know he he said I I
[1:24:01] you know the theology it's kind of like
[1:24:02] the Theology of man but when when he had
[1:24:05] his friend who was like a a fire chief
[1:24:07] or whatever there was a there was a fire
[1:24:09] that broke out and and he was pointing
[1:24:11] to him he said now men go ahead and spur
[1:24:14] the water over there you know while the
[1:24:15] the place is burning up and he's like
[1:24:18] put some over there put some over there
