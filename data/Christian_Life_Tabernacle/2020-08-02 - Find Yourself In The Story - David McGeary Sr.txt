Description:
Find Yourself In The Story
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Sunday Service: August 2,  2020. 
Christian Life Tabernacle Bedford, Texas. 

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marrion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

need of the quickening power of life this morning Lord may we be as the psalmist David and say I will call upon the Lord for he's worthy to be praised so shall I be delivered from my enemies that's right realizing Lord this morning we have one Arch Enemy Lord that manifest himself in many ways Lord we have a a bigger God that's manifested before us we pray Lord that each one of us can demonstrate that this morning and Lord there be any newcomers here that Lord The Life of Christ would be amongst us as job said I have heard of thee with the hearing of the ear but now my eyes cease help us Lord this morning to enter into a sweet presence As we sing these songs of praise and worship Lord Lord you'd come as you have many times your sweet Holy Spirit Lord just soothe our nerves and may we lay aside all the things that would Hinder Lord and enter into that sweet presence and prepare for the preaching of the word such that when it comes forth Lord be a lifegiving water to the seed

omnip prison God Lord he can provide provide every need that we have so Lord we we love you and we lift you up ask As We Go From Here Lord we can truly say we've been in your presence we ask this all in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen happy to be Gather in the hearts of God want to welcome everyone all our visitors and those are streaming from home we welcome you this morning as you invite budy Mike for a Psalm reading this morning God bless you I uh was chatting briefly with my uh with my dad this yesterday morning um and he was describing how exhausted he was after moving across the country and restarting his life and getting settled in a new house and all the stuff that you move and all the stuff that breaks and all the stuff that's different one thing that he commented on was that my mother seem to be continually propelled with that energy that Homemakers do where even long into the night after the man has collapsed into a coma the wife is about the Homemaker making sure that everything is just so to create an atmosphere for the home you know you know and I just got to thinking about that you know that's her place as a homemaker Amen to make a house a home and you know the man might go about building a house yes sir and he might make the strongest Foundation you can make he might make the thickest walls he might make a roof that can withstand six pound hailstones he's the home builder but she's the home maker she comes in and she's the one that sets the atmosphere puts the curtains in a certain place puts the rugs in a certain place puts all the knicknacks where they are you've all been there all right how's this look move it to the left a bit no that's too far you know we've all been there you know that's the hom maker right you know and I was thinking about how we were talking about a dwelling place a couple weeks ago and how he has a Dwelling Place he as our groom has a home right he said in John 14 I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am yes sir there you may be also so you know we we spoke a little bit about how a groom and a bride in a dwelling place together here right so you just wonder is as if he if that isn't a pattern for what his taste is you know here he is where he's come and he's presented us with a dwelling place that he's built a place for us to enter enter into and be with him but now he's looking for a bride to come in and make that a home to put everything just so to welcome him that it would be pleasing and comfortable and hospitable for him amen you know in Psalm 93 verse 5 we're going to read out of Psalm 93 this morning there was a phrase there that caught my attention and it says this thy test tonies are very sure Holiness becometh thy house you know the Amplified Bible says it this way that Holiness is becoming to your house you know when you say something is becoming it means it's attractive it's pleasing it's lovely it's pretty it's comely it's tasteful it's fashionable that's according to you know one of the the soures that you can look at but you know the Lord has a home decorator for his home and it's his bride right and the adornment of his house is Holiness that's the fashion that's the taste that's what's pleasing to him of all the patterns of the world available for her to choose from she chooses Holiness unto the Lord and that's the pattern the atmosphere the decoration the fashion if you will that his bride adorns his house to welcome him in his home that it would be pleasing to him and comfortable to him you know Psalm 29:2 says give unto the Lord the glory do his name Worship the Lord in the beauty of Holiness Holiness is an attractive adornment for his house that he leaves it to his bride to decorate with so he's looking for someone one a people a bride who would welcome him into his house with the adornment of Holiness and not a Holiness of you know dressing right and living right and all that Holiness is separation from all other loves except your love for him as we read last week unite my heart that's right to Fear Thy Name you know so how many of you would want to welcome him yes amen make him pleased to dwell welcome him into not only just the presence of this house but into the house that he has ministered an entrance to you to on a daily basis may we be pleasing to him as it song says pleasing pleasing let me be pleasing to you that's we attract his presence we make him feel at home content to dwell by an adornment of Holiness separation from all others unto him so that phrase kind of caught my attention this morning so just a short Psalm this morning we'll go ahead and read together Psalm 93 the Lord reth he is clothed with Majesty the Lord is clothed with strength wherein he hath GED himself the world also is established that it cannot be moved thy Throne is established of old thou art from Everlasting the floods have lifted up O Lord the floods have lifted up their voice the floods lift up their waves the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many Waters yay than the mighty waves of the sea thy testimonies are very sure Holiness becometh thine house O Lord forever amen amen God bless you I have your seats this morning i' sing that song give you that old time R amen it's the

your infallible word would once again be our portion we're not here for personality we're not here for entertainment we're here to sit at your feet yes and ask that you would use mortal flesh and human failure and yet that you would speak and that each of us could walk from here today knowing that that you spoke to us personally we ask you father we ask you to grant that this morning we ask you to forgive us our sins and our trespasses the battle that we fight within our flesh and mind we just once again just come before you humbly asking you to be with us this morning for we ask these things in the lovely and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you this morning if you have your Bibles let's turn over into the book of um St Mark and read the 20 4th chapter of St Mark and uh 24th chapter I'm I'm if you find 24 chapters in Mark you let me know okay because I want that Bible I want all the word of God no this the 7th chapter of Mark the 24th verse it says in the uh Gospel of St Mark the 7th chapter and the 24th verse it says and from from then he rose and went into the border of Tyra and sedon and entered into the into an house and would have no man know it but he could not be hid for a certain woman whose young daughter had an unclean Spirit heard of him and came and fell at his feet and the woman was a Greek a seropian by nation and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but Jesus said unto her let the children first be filled for it is not meant to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs and she answered and said unto him yes Lord yay the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and he said unto her for this saying go thy way the devil is gone out of thy daughter and when she was come to her house she found the devil gone out and her daughter laid upon the bed our gracious father once again bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated what I would like to do this morning and I know it's uh maybe difficult uh with the streaming and things the way it is and we appreciate the uh this streaming that um the people that have been streaming and the support that we've got online from uh those that come fellowship with us many come afterwards and um follow but you know our heart is set on doing our best to follow this message just the way it was given and I've always felt in my heart that it's always important for us to listen to the word of God together as Believers not just individually at home uh there's a lot of benefits to that and I believe that you should listen to tapes but and and you you make that choice of of what tape that you decide to listen to some start in 40s and go all the way through and some start and go backwards and some just let a title come on their heart but when when I come to the message and I want to play a portion this morning with you is uh because I try to find something that the Lord lays on my heart that is fitting the circumstances that we're in and so this message uh very common uh many of you heard it brother Brandon preached the subject matter I I think almost five times it's called persever perseverant uh but uh we'd like to take this this morning this next 25 minutes as kind of a foundation as our approach this morning that you can uh listen to what's being said and then when we go back and talk about it uh we can uh we can Fellowship on it and if I if I was to have a a title this morning I'd like to title this find yourself in the story find yourself in the story so I just read the scripture that brother Bram read and so we're going to pick up in the message called perseverance starting at paragraph uh uh I uh paragraph um 16 I believe it is and then we will just go through uh paragraph 64 just a small portion of it I believe it's about 25 minutes long and if if you just listen uh just pick up little things as you goow away but uh remember what I'd like just to fellowship with you a little bit this morning is finding yourself in the story and and so I hope this this is a blessing to you this morning it it's it's a wonderful message uh it really came upon my heart and uh it's really a blessing so uh we'll just do that at this time let's just ask the Lord to bless his word and then we'll listen to it this morning heavenly father bless your word to us the next moment as we listen to your message that you sent us the letter that you sent us from eternity that was written to us in this day that we could sit back and and and hear what you would have to speak speak to our hearts this morning Father help us stay true to this word we ask you to bless the people now as they hear your voice father the vessel that you chose to speak through in this this hour we ask you to bless it to the people in jesus' name we pray amen this is perseverance toeka Canyon uh to Pika Kansas excuse me uh June 19th 1964 God bless you you might say brother Brandon that's a that's a very small word for 3 or 400 people sitting here tonight or whatever there is I'm a poor uh judge of of of a audience and you say that's a very small word well it isn't the the size it's it's it's really what I'm going to say about it now perseverance according to Webster it's um it's to be uh it's it's uh a word that you're to be persistent to means to be persistent in trying to make a goal try to to put something over try to do something you are perseverant when you are persistent now all Christians must be persistent they must be perseverant and the only way that you're able to to do this is the first to have faith in what you're trying to do and if you have no faith you're just jumping at it then you you you can't cannot be persevering but when you really know it's the truth then there's nothing going to stop you you are really persevering then and man of all ages that's ever been able to do anything and had faith in what they were trying to do were persevering for instance like the what we call the father of our nation George Washington uh he was persevering uh when he trying to achieve that victory over the British and cross the icy Delaware he was persevering there was nothing his soldiers half of them didn't even have shoes on their feet their feets was wrapped in rags the wind was blowing but he had prayed all night and he had the victory in his heart and there was no British army or nothing else was going to stop him neither could the iy river he had prayed through and there was no hindrance going to stop him he was perseverant and he achieved the task that he was trying to to do because he had the answer from God when a man gets his answer from God there's nothing going to stop him most people today as I will repeat myself from last night saying they have hope instead of Faith you find people coming on the platform they're they're just built up in Hope but faith is the substance of things hope for the evidence it's not a myth it's not imagination it's something you've got you've already got it and you're just as happy with it that faith that you have as you would be if you had the substance in your hand for instance like this if I'm starving to death and a loaf of bread cost us a quarter which will will buy the loaf of bread now when when I have the quarter in my hand I'm just as happy as if it was a loaf of bread because it's a purchase price of the bread amen and when I know in my heart that I have accepted it and I believe that God has given to me I'm just as happy as that Faith as if I was if I was healed because I'm going to be healed anyhow Hallelujah I've got the substance right now nobody can take it away from me I know it's right and I can be perseverant with that when God tells something is going to happen like the Visions or something I've seen tens of thousands of them and many of you are witnessed and not one of them has ever failed and When God says anything I don't if he would say tonight go to the National Cemetery for I'm going to raise up George Washington in the morning I'd invite the whole world come watch it it's going to happen amen God's word Can't Fail he's never failed and he can't fail there's one thing God can't do and that's fail he cannot fail in God is his word now Noah was living in a scientific age when they was perhaps could shoot the moon with radar Jesus said it was a day like this as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the coming of the son of man now we know down in Egypt we see these pyramides we could not reproduce them today we have no power to do it they had a hold of atomic power or some kind of power that built the pyramids we couldn't put those Boulders up there by no means neither could we reproduce that Sphinx there's no way of doing it we don't have the material to make a mummy uh in bomb a body that looks even natural for thousands of years we've lost that art a diey that won't fade out many things they had then that we are completely blind of and they built that pyramid soour setting so Center in the earth no matter where the sun is there's never a shadow around it never a shadow at the pyramid all the architectur the the the instruments they they had is far beyond now and Noah lived in that intellectual scientific age Noah did and he was a prophet and the Lord told him that it was going to rain and after Noah hearing the voice of God being a prophet to the voice of the Lord word of the Lord comes to his prophet and he knew it was going to rain no matter what anyone else said whether ever rain and it never had rained before God irrigated the ground with the vegetation with with irrigation from the springs and so forth in the earth there had never been a cloud in the sky but yet Noah knew there was coming water from above how does he go to do it he doesn't know but he was so perseverant he went and build an ark according to the uh specification that God said for him to build it because he had heard the voice of God and was standing in the presence of God when the voice of God was made manifest to him that ought to set this Born Again Church AAR amen perseverance I don't care how many critics laugh about it how many says it can't be so and they go out there and scientifically prove it shoot the radar to the moon and show there is no such a thing as water in the skies but Noah knew that if God standing in his presence and his the god that had spoke to him and he was clearly identified that it was God's word and standing in the presence of God he was he was persistent he would build the ark anyhow nobody wanted to help him he'd build it himself he was persistent because he was know that it was the word of God and he buildt it I can think of of how Moses a great scholar he was so smart that he could he could teach the wisdom to the Egyptians he could teach the teachers he knowed all of the the theology uh of that the Egyptians knowed and of his Hebrew family and he was a smart witty man a great we taught his was a military man but it totally failed because one thing he slew this Egyptian and his education ceased when they accused him then will you slay us as you did the Egyptian thinking his brethen would understand it and he he miserably failed and that brings me to a thought of this that's the reason tonight that our systems has failed that's the reason that we will never be able to educate people to God we'll never be able to denominate them to God we've tried all these systems and they all fail like fell like the Tower of Babel and they always will do that God the unchanging God made his decision at the Garden of Eden how he would save man and when God ever makes a decision it has to ever remain that way he cannot change he cannot get smarter he's the source of all intelligence no matter what our science says if it's against the intelligence or the word of God it's contrary it's not right I don't care how scientifically can be proved it's still wrong God decided he would save a man by by the shed blood of an innocent one they've tried to build cities they've tried to unite them they've tried to build towers educate them into it and they get further away all the time you'll never be able to save man till he comes back to the blood amen that's the only place that God will ever meet a man not by his intellectuals not by how smart he is how many man has made him a priest or bishop or state overseer whatever he might be min Minister Deacon that isn't the grounds that God meets a man on he meets him on the grounds when he's under the shed blood that's the only place Israel ever was able to meet God to worship was under the shed blood that's God's provided way no other way will work and under the shed blood God meets man and stands in the presence of man Moses this runaway intellectual runaway prophet out on the back side of the desert and married this beautiful Ethiopian woman and was living had a child little gersham one day while walking around on the desert the back side of the desert an old man of 80 years old looked like was come out of use as a minister but he found a bush that was burning with fire and it did not consume and he went aside to see what had happened and come into the presence of God and heard the presence of God heard the voice of God while he was in his presence when this Pillar of Fire was laying in this bush talking to him where he was afraid to even go near Egypt knowing if Pharaoh would take his life there's nothing going to stop him now and sometimes when a man gets in the presence of God and hears the voice of God he does sing so so radical to the ordinary thinking of people it sounds ridiculous the next day now a man that was afraid to take an army to attack Egypt all the slaves there was in Egypt he's afraid to attack Pharaoh like that here he is the next day 80 years old beard hanging all the way to his waistline his bald head shiny a crooked stick in his hand his wife sitting on a mule with a young on her hip going down with his eyes set up glorifying God where are you going Moses going down to Egypt to take over a one-man Invasion amen why he had been in the presence of God Amen he seen what God could do with a stick he didn't know what he could do with an army he know what he could do with a stick amen I don't know what he can do by denomination I know what he can do with one man that'll surrender himself completely to him it's all he needs one person that's you then he's persevering nothing's going to stop him Moses had come in the presence of God heard his voice in a a miracle sign he know he was a consuming fire and here he is in the pillar of fire back in the bush all of his education all of his theology left him and he know one thing there was a God and he had his orders a Crooked Stick was good enough amen amen been in the presence of God don't make any difference how many trained men Egypt had any of these things didn't mean a thing to Moses he had been in the presence of God and he was persevering he's going down to take over against Shields and trained Man by the tens of thousands with a crooked stick in his hand stop him if you can there's nothing can stop him amen and he did it he went out and took over because he was perseverant when he absolutely know that he was had been in the presence of God and had heard the voice of God out of the presence of God amen amen not only the voice was but it was a scriptural voice there's all kinds of voices check it with the word the voice said I'm the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob I made a promise that I would deliver those people the time is at hand I've heard their groaning seen their uh taskmasters burdening them and I remember my promise have come down to deliver him and I'm sending you to do it that's good enough you seen his glory and away he went David was very perseverant when he come over to the the armies of Israel which was standing in a bluff at that time and uh across the little creek and over on the other side was the the Philistine there was Goliath the great Challenger about twice the size height of an ordinary man 14 in fingers and a great spear several feet long that could stand there and just pick man on it like that and throw him off punch him out pick him up on the spear and throw him off as they come up the hill and when the enemy knows that he's got the upper hand on you he likes to brag so he said let's not have so much Bloodshed said Saul let some of your man come over here and fight me if I kill him well then you serve us but if he kills me uh uh we'll serve you see when the enemy's got that upper hand and every Soldier was just so shaky that he could hardly hold his armor up and saw the most able of all of them Head and Shoulders above his army he wouldn't dare touch him and yet supposed to be the anointed of the Lord but there come from the Wilderness a little stoop shouldered Ruddy looking fell that had a slingshot in his hand and that giant made his brag before the wrong man amen and David said do you mean to tell me that you'll let that uncircumcised Philistine stand there and defy the armies of the Living God Amen do you mean to tell me that you'll do such a thing as that now his brother said now you're naughty you get back out there at the Sheep where you belong and the News come to Saul Saul said bring the lad here let me look at him when he come up little stoop Ruddy looking F standing there probably hair hanging down his eyes and he said would you you can't fight that man said you're nothing but a little fell little little readyy man in your Youth and he's been a warrior since his youth he said you can't fight him I admire your courage but the uh That's too great what happened he said let me see if you could use my armor so he put his armor on him give him his shield well poor little David couldn't stand up he he he said he he didn't know nothing about it he found out that Saul's ecclesiastical vest didn't fit a man of God so he said I'll send him away and get him a school in a PhD lld and so forth and see what he can do about it he said I don't know nothing about these things take them off of me I I don't know nothing about this but here's one thing I do know I was hurting my father's sheep and a lion come in and got one of them and I went after him because my father had G me charge to watch those Sheep amen and any good shepherd is a watcher of the Sheep amen and he said I don't have nothing but this slingshot in my hand but I knocked him down and when he rose up against me I slew him and a bear come in and got one I run after him and tuck it out of his mouth and when he rose up I killed him and said how much more will God of Israel God Of Heaven deliver that uncircumcised Philistine into my hand that little fellow was persevering because he know what he was talking about he know who he had believed and was fully persuaded is able to keep that which he committed to him against the day now he had just a slingshot that's all he had he said I'll go fight the Philistines because the reason he was so persevering he know if God under the care of a sheep had helped him deliver the Sheep back to his father how much more a man now think of that all min ERS and we feel that way about you sheep tonight the devil has come and smoked you with the disease it's trying he's tuck you out from the good health I I don't have no PhD I don't have no lldd I don't even have a grammar school education but I know what I do have I'm coming after you tonight to bring you back to the Shady Green Pastures and the Still Waters Hallelujah that's what we're here on the platform for tonight is to come get you snatch you out of the hand of the lion out there bring you back be patient listen close and watch try to find what we're trying to do is try to help you now David was very persistent because that he knew who he had believed and he know he was able to commit what he committed to him he was able to keep it we find out that Samson another a great judge in Israel and that some people picture Samson is having uh shoulders about like a barn door now it would be nothing strange about that to see a man who could pick up the gates of Gaya and walk out with it or take a line and pull him apart but you know Samson was just a little bitty in the street expression a little shrimp little bitty old curly-headed sissified mama's boy seven curls it was a strange thing when they thought that a man a great big uh 10-foot man could pick up a line sure and kill him but the strange thing was this little fellow seemed to be helpless until the Spear of the Lord come on him it wasn't Samson it was the spirit of the Lord amen that's the reason that it wasn't the apostles Jesus chose them all practically every one of them without even enough education to sign their name he didn't choose priest he didn't choose theologians he chose fishermen and herdsmen the ignorant and unlearned so that he could take that in his hand and take nothing and make something out of it amen that's his nature so he doesn't take train schools and train Scholars he takes something that realizes it's nothing and gets into it and makes something out of it we find that this Sam now it's all you can go listen to the rest of it at home amen amen and I hope you do I I hope you do we just want to take uh some thoughts uh from this uh this morning to minister and and it's like he said you know a pastor wants to uh snatch you know out of the hands of the devil you you hate to see the enemy having uh influence the the way that he does and you know when we look at this uh the hour that we're living in now you know there all this uh politics everywhere nothing's without politics you you don't know what a person's saying what their motive and objective is it's yeah I don't think we've ever seen such a time of confusion uh going on we we don't know what the future is and you know you're you're scared to death to sit next to somebody because you think that they're going to get you and and uh uh you know and that that's just the the thing is uh you know there's it's different and there's different opinions every where and there's fear everywhere and there's uncertainty everywhere and and that's just the way it is you know but uh that's not our world Amen that's not our world we don't live there that's right amen we don't think there uh we don't rest there we don't have a part of it that that's just not our world this is what the prophet of God said he said God promised his seed to be a Stranger in a Strange Land amen and be misjudged by the people and that they would sojourn Abraham's seed can you imagine that that God promised you to be a stranger amen because that's not our world we're not part of that world we're sojourners here we're just traveling through and so we don't want to get caught down that's not our world we're not a part of it you know our world's a Bible World our world's a word word world that's what we are you know it's like we there's our world and then there's the other world Amen we live in a world of Promise that's what that's what we are we're Children Of Promise Abraham and his seed were the children of Promise they were the result of a promise that's what we are the result of a promise we live by God's promised word and it's by these great and precious promises that were partakers of divine nature and and we look at it and people trying to find security and and and trying to uh uh press forward but our whole effort it are put forth to keep the other world out of our world we want to keep that other world out we don't want it to start flooding in and and that's what's that's what's uh we're beginning to see it uh no doubt we we'll uh be criticized for uh coming together this morning uh there's nothing you can do that you can't find a critic anymore every everybody's on one such one side or one thing uh you know you can Edge your lawn and and uh someone think well it's just not straight enough there's just nothing you can do that you don't have a critic but aren't you glad you have to go through the Hall of critics before you can get to the Hall of Fame so we understand this morning that that we don't draw our resources from the world we're not of this world World we're not part of this world this is not our world that's not our inheritance amen we have an inheritance and The Inheritance say I give you a peace that surpass understanding I give you a joy unspeakable and full of Glory that's our world we're not we're not going to be brought down we're not going to be taken apart we're not going to uh like I said we're not going to shelter and we're going to Fellowship in place you know we're not going to let what's ever going on destroy us and that's why this message just seemed to uh speak to my heart in in in the way that it is about about being uh persevering and you know and he said he said what the definition of perseverance means is to keep after it you just keep going you keep pressing you have an a journey and you have something that you want to fulfill but you know I noticed something and why this struck out so much to me was I I see so many people getting to the place that they just want to throw in the towel you know what I mean I'm just going to give it all up and I'm going to go to the mountain somewhere and I'm just going to take the little bit of money that I have and I'm just going to live on it they just don't want to go forward they don't want to keep pressing they just want to give it up I I talked to a friend of mine he owns a restaurant and we were sitting there talking to him and and he said you know when all the restaurants closed he said I thought about throwing in the towel he said but I you know I I didn't want to quit he said so I I I I cook the food myself amen my wife helped me and and we kept pressing we kept persevering and then it opened up a little bit and opened up a little bit but he said so many of other restaurants have shut down they're gone they threw in the towel yes sir they're never going to recover why because they didn't Pur exist they didn't go up against the odds they didn't press the channel they didn't fight against what's coming against them you understand this whole thing out here is nothing but a great big depression just wants to get you in a spirit of quitting why why keep going why do this why do that don't matter that's not our world amen every Christian must be perseverant every Christian you know we got things to do we still have a job to do we still have a commission yes sir right no they just don't say okay you you just go away someplace and you stay six feet away from everybody and you wrap a mask around your mouth and and that's fine that don't stop me from testifying I'll testify to you 6 fet away I'll testify to you through my mask I'm commissioned we got to we got to press through we got to be perseverant you you keep pressing the mark you don't just fold uh at at at everything there's things that that we we want to achieve am there's something that we're after he said now notice what he did in this scripture when he's talking about perseverance he went back through the scriptures and use scriptural stories to show you the value of what it takes to persevere these men were persistent and there's a promise made to us a promise is made to us today that this message was sent to us to restore back to us the Faith of Our Fathers I'd like to read this again to you if if you would allow me to I know I'm not a good reader but you're very patient with me he said most people today as I repeated myself from last night say they have hope instead of faith so and Hope's Good Hope is the is the it is the breeding ground of Faith you hope for something but one day you get it and the Hope's done away with now you have the evidence of what you hope for just like a little uh child that maybe puts in their Christmas request oh I hope I get a fire truck I hope I get a fire truck or a doll or or or whatever it is you know and uh or I'd like to get this for my birthday or something like that you know nowadays we don't even ask anymore we just say what do you want for your birthday you know and then you say well I'd like this I'd like that and so that's a hope yeah you're you're hoping you get it I hopeing I get it but when it it arrives you don't hope for it anymore you possess it and so there's something that we're trying to to to achieve George Washington he wanted to achieve that Victory he how can I win this how can I defeat these British he sought the Lord he got out before the Lord Lord what should I do what can I do to win this war they we're outnumbered we're out we're out fed we're out we're not equipped the way they are how can what can I do speak to me he sought the Lord he prayed for the Lord give me what what move do I need to make he had something that he wanted to accomplish he wanted freedom they were fighting for freedom of religion the freedom to live and do right and he prayed all night and the Lord showed him if you'll cross the Delaware I don't know was it Christmas Eve or something that he crossed the Delaware Christmas day or something he said if you do this you will catch them by surprise no matter how treacherous it looked he from he received a vision from the Lord he got an answer from God if you will go do this you will be victorious but it looked crazy didn't it but he he's stuck with it yes sir you understand he had to chop the ice off the boats he had to get the men together he could you understand there took a lot of effort that went into that we just read it like a Bible story but we need to put ourselves in the story put yourself in the story put yourself as that man making that decision for all those other people think of those soldiers each one had to play their part they got behind them they join forces together yes sir they got got one spirit and one mind with one goal and one objective and when they United together into the achievement that they wanted to achieve they became Victorious together takes you all to do it take it it took them all but when you put yourself in your story you understand there took a lot more to be persistent yes sir there's a lot of other things to battle against I don't like to be cold I would have said George I don't want to leave the fire sometimes it takes courage to be brave to stand up so we know that he had something that he wanted to achieve so he wasn't hoping for it he he knew if he would cross that River come on and attack them troops that they would be drunken they would be lazy they wouldn't be expecting it yes sir and he got his victory well I'll tell you something on that's where a lot of Satan gets a lot of Christians is they lay down on the job they they just get amnesia they forget they're in a battle they they forget they're trying to struggle for something to achieve something to accomplish something everybody's just sitting on their Laurels waiting amen we know we don't wait we're about our father's business we we're people that are called to something we have a goal did you hear what he said he said be persistent in trying to make a goal trying to put something over trying to do something we're trying to put something over we're trying to let the people know that God has sent a Divine message to this world today to save them from the uncoming destruction right it's an arc this message is an arc and so you you see what he says he says but when a man gets his answers from God there's there's nothing going to stop himen he says many people today I said last night say they have hope instead of faith we find people coming on the platform they're just built up in hope I hope I get it I hope I get it I hope I get it I hope it's right do you understand we've got to move past hope that's right we have got the come to the place that we have a vision we understand what our lives about we understand where we're going we understand what we're doing we know what we're trying to achieve we know what it is that we want to possess now you may not have it but if you're hoping for it and you're persistent and you keep pressing the mark you keep going towards it working towards it one day you'll have it in your hand you know I talk to a lot of people about houses I've sit down with lots and lots of people the first thing they do is they DW they draw out their dreamhouse sitting there talking to a little somebody you know what I mean and and oh they got this plan maybe make 4 $30,000 a year and they draw up a five bedroom house you know three bath twocc car garage on an acre of land okay that what you're hoping for but if they would have hold that Vision they'd go live in that two-bedroom house and fix it up on they would go get the next house and work on it and they go do the next thing and the next thing and they'd be persistent one one day they take possession of that but as long as they sit around in a dream and do nothing they have nothing and we're what do we got scripture says we have not because we ask not we have not because we do not you do nothing you get nothing you have something to show for so he goes on he say he says faith is a substance of things hoped for it's the evidence it's not a myth it's not imagination it's something you've [Music] got you already got it amen and you're just as happy with it the faith that you have as you would be if you had the substance in your hand you're just as happy with the faith that's right just as much joy in the faith is if you had the result and I love how he explains this because this is what we're trying to be persistent to this is what we want to achieve this statement right here I feel is what we as a body should be trying to achieve this is what we should be after this is what we should be pressing to a belief in every word of God that's right and I love how our messenger explains it he says for instance like this if I'm starving to death now put yourself in the story has anybody in here no I won't ask it because I can look at you you all look like you're nice and plump and doing real fine none of us have been starving to death but put yourself in the story if you're starving to death you're in bad shape you're weak you're you're you're trembling you're on the verge of of of collapse you're fixing to perish you're not just hungry you're past hungry you're starting to look at your fingers and they're starting to look good you know you're starting to figure out which parts of you you can live without you're hungry you're starving put yourself in the story yeah yes sir he said like I'm starving to death and a loaf of bread cost a quarter a quarter will buy the loaf of bread amen now when I have the quarter in my hand I'm just as happy as if it was the loaf of bread because it's the purchase price of the bread oh my if we could when we could start coming to that when we're just as happy with the promise because we know the promise is going to come to pass amen we got the message we know the rapture's coming we know we have the purchased price we're just as happy like today as if the Rapture has already taken place that's that's the kind of Faith yes sir see we're all we get oh let me just finish the statement because it's the purchase of the bread and when I know in my heart that I've accepted it and believe that God has give it to me I'm just as happy with that Faith as I was if I was healed because I'm going to get healed anyhow see we're on the back end of it I'm going to get happy when I get healed I'm going to testify when I get healed you don't need persistence if you're healed you need the persistence until you obtain what's been promised just as happy with the promise just as happy with your election I'm chosen my name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life I'm happy with [Applause] that I know I'm going in the Rapture I'm just content how do you know I heard the [Applause] voice I heard Malachi 45 I saw Revelations 10:7 I saw Luke 17:30 I've seen the word of God it was give to me I didn't earn it I didn't deserve it it came by the shed blood so this is what we're talking about this is what we ought to be Pur in to this is what we ought to be fighting to this is what we ought to be pressing to is a faith that says I'm just as happy with the promise as I am with the [Applause] result but that's the spirit of the age the spirit of the age isn't one of Faith it's one of science it's one of Education come on so in other words we don't get excited till we got it cuz nobody believes anybody anymore you don't trust nobody we don't and there's more mistrust being sown every day nobody's trusting in everybody everybody's picking on everybody everybody's a scared of everybody you know I me but praise God there's light there shall be light in the evening time the path of Glory we shall surely find amen we're not throwing in the towel amen you know there there's no such thing as Retirement for a Christian that's right someone says ' when are you going to retire I said' I get retired every morning at the end of the day I'm retired I'm all tired all over again but what am I going to enter into my rest I'm going to get up the next morning I'm going to live that day I'm going to fight that day I'm going to stand for the gospel that day I'm going to testify that day that I'm a possessor of the promise and if I have the promise I possess the [Applause] result what this is the atmosphere this is what the people of the world needs to walk into was what our messenger presented to us day after day he didn't care what the problem was cuz he knew there's God that he was in you was greater than he was in the world he just got tired of seeing seeing people give up that's right they didn't have the result they think the promise is no good the result doesn't make the promise the promise makes the result if you don't believe in the promise the result's not going to make you believe the promise you know why cuz I'll tell you what Satan does people don't believe the promise God does something for them and then they attribute it it to somebody else other than the word of God they don't walk into the doctor saying praise God doc God's going to use you to heal me because the word of God says I'm Healed by the stripes of Jesus Christ I just thought maybe you'd like to work along with the Lord but if you don't I'm going to get healed [Applause] anyway you don't say oh now fix me up doc and then I'm all healed and then you say oh I'm Healed oh the promise is true come on no no that's not what he wants this church to achieve he wants this church to achieve an absolute absolute belief in the unadulterated word of God every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every ly if he said so that settles it I believe for my children I believe for my loved ones I believe for [Applause] anybody I don't care I'm not looking its symptoms that's not my world I don't live in the world of symptoms I don't live in the world of Education I don't live in the world of science I live in the world of promise [Applause] I live by these promises so we we just see and and I I'm just talking of the pattern that he followed we don't want to throw in the towel I hear it all over the place I never hear a person say oh I'm just tired of this world I'm going to quit I'm going to retire wait a minute well what about does God have something for me to do what would what would you have me to do Lord yes sir my time's running out I I I'm I'm not going to be on this job I'm not going to be on that job my I'm school's coming out I'm running out of school time's up I'm going to graduate now I've got something set before me well you don't you don't retire from school it's about time you can get in God's School spend some time in the word and wash all that stuff out that they're trying to put in your head out there I feel sorry for kids cuz you know who's teaching them all the people that I smoked pot with back in when I was a hippie that's who's teaching them I mean there are some good Godly teachers but I'm talking about the general run of the m yeah right aren't you glad you got a real teacher sent from God the latter rain amen the former Reign the teaching rign to bring forth the fruit so we're talking morning about finding yourself in the story so brother Bram took these Bible stories and he brought those stories to us and he goes talks about Mary he talks about all these great people through the scriptures how that they stuck with God's word how they persisted how that they battle and and and so we've got to take ourselves and put ourselves in the story yes sir put yourself in the story look at it for yourself make contact with the word of God when you start reading your Bible you should only you should see Jesus Christ in every scripture you should see the word of God the presence of God the wisdom of God the instruction of God for all scriptures given for instructions in righteousness for reproof well you look at Moses you know and I always say this you know a lot of times people have a a lot of negativity towards education now I'm not an educated person many of you know I never graduated from high school in a four-year uh program and so I like the scriptures about God using uneducated men but you know I can hold that scripture in unrighteousness cuz God doesn't like ignorance either amen he don't like an excuse he wants people that are working that are persistent that are going forward but I thought many of you have college education which I'm I'm very thankful for and if you were to sit down with me I'll just make it public if you can afford college and you can go to college I'm happy that you go to college amen if it can earn you more then you can earn more you can give more you can help your family but Moses was educated but it shows what a surrendered person can do that has an education so you put yourself in the story yeah I got a college degree but Moses had a college degree but he surrendered that hallu to the hands of God you put yourself in this story Moses was a complete failure yes sir I don't know if many of you have even have had the experience of being a complete failure but I'll tell you when you're a complete failure sir it's hard to get out of bed amen it's hard to put your feet on the ground you don't know where to turn you don't know how to think you don't know which way's right you don't know which way's left you don't know what's wrong you don't know anything you're lost you're disconnected you're defeated you're you're so good every you put everything you had into something and it's worked out nothing you're broke come on pre and you're forced to your knees in total desperation that was Moses I'll never forget that verse it stuck with me all my life is from the movie The 10 Commandments when Moses is being driven into the Wilderness and it says Moses didn't know whether to bless or to curse the spirit that drove him sometimes God drives you to places but being a total failure doesn't mean anything with God that's right fact sometimes he might have even been the cause of your failure on you may have brought it upon your yourself you may have made wrong decisions but unbelief don't stop God that how you put yourself in the in the story Moses was educated Moses was a complete failure yes sir and God got a hold of him God meant him God brought him to the burning bush God didn't bring me to the burning bush amen I believe that God's brought us to the pillar of fire you start putting yourself in the story look at it look at yourself spend time in the story yes sir oh I honestly I believe that's what brother brandom did I'll never forget I heard him preach and he said now here comes Jesus and he drops by and picks up his friend Lazarus Hallelujah I'm thinking what I grabbed my Bible I never saw that before but somebody saw it someone who put himself in the story not just in his mind I think he literally put himself in the story but he went down and picked up Lazarus to go down and see John you start finding yourself you start finding yourself in the scriptures you look at Moses you talk about Moses being persistent he kept going amen he turned the water to blood you think that would do it that didn't work he didn't say okay I'm leaving town he threw the stick down and the they did the same thing he didn't say uhoh I'm out of here this didn't go the way I I went I thought this would work well I walked in there I thought man I got a stick put yourself in the story how how he must have thought what what you think that he was up against when he threw the stick down and they threw the stick down and he stood there what did he go back to he didn't go back to the stick he went back to the voice that spoke to him out of the burning bush he knew that God spoke to them there he was his stick ate that thing then he goes down let my people go no turns the water to blood think that' do it that didn't do it then there's frogs frogs in the cupboard frogs in the sheets frogs frogs in the shoes frogs in the soup frogs in the spaghetti frogs in the sink frogs in the drain frogs frogs frogs frogs you think they all went to TCU or something there was frogs everywhere you think that would have done it I can just see Moses walking down to Pharaoh's the croaking going on everywhere ribbit ribbit ribbit whole Egypt sounds like Ribbit and he walks into Pharaoh let my people go no barl says no MOS okay frogs ain't doing it I ain't doing it no uhuh he's persistent he knew he wanted that Faith you see it's not the result that we're after we're after the faith in God's word that's what we got to be persistent for every single one of those denials drove him back to the word and he reconfirmed that word in his heart God said so I don't care if what Pharaoh does I'm going to do what the Lord told me to do I'm going to be persistent I don't care what the obstacles are I don't care what the resistance is I don't care now you put yourself in his shoes I mean then he sent lice lice can you imagine the scratching and the itching every man in Egypt looked just like me after a week he done scratched it all gone put yourself in the store put yourself Moses kept going he kept persistent he kept one thing after the another after lice all the cattle got sick after the cattle got sick everybody broke out and boils now Pharaoh was a hard nose in fact this scripture says that God hardened his heart you would think any reasonable man would have give up maybe the first one's a fluke but the second one wait a minute something's going on here you think any man would give up put yourself in the story Satan resists God loves to try his children the prophet of God preached and be certain of God you be certain of God God loves to put his children to the test he will loves to see if they'll stick with it if they'll keep pressing for it I'm asking you this morning are you pressing for that faith that was once delivered to the Saints it is the promise of the age that this church would be a second book of Acts because there's people yes sir that are just as joyous with the promise Hallelujah they don't need the see the result the result doesn't have to come in any time in any season the result is in their faith and in the promise it'll come when it comes but it's coming he kept going hail Locust finally the firstborn in Egypt and that didn't even stop them they had to be persistent until they got to that Promised Land yes sir put yourself in the story maybe there's things pressing against you maybe you're trying things and you think they ought have worked don't give up yes sir don't quit amen if God be for you who can be against you you have a desire in your heart it's God's desire to give you the desire of your heart fear not little children yes sir it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom but F seek ye first the kingdom of God and everything will be added unto you other words seek first the peace that comes in believing every Pro promise and then you'll be content in whatever state you're in we don't measure Faith by Prosperity we don't measure Christianity by Prosperity amen if fact it's harder for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven than it is for a camel to crawl through the narrow needle gate it's not our world we can't start measuring ourselves by the world our faith doesn't fit in the world we're sojourners amen yes God promised us oh Hallelujah it it's not a description it's a promise that we would be sojourners it's a promise we won't get attached to this world it's a promise we won't be a part of the world it's a promise God promised his children that they'd be sojourners in a foreign land this is a foreign land to me it is not our world thank God for the promise that I don't live by that world I'm not a part of that world I don't rest in that world I live by the word of God every son and daughter of God lives by the word of God man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth from the mouth of the father that's what we're contending for we're contending for the faith amen that says Silver and Gold Have I None but that which I have that's right we've we've quit being perseverant I don't now's not the time to fold now is not the time to throw in the towel now is times to get the towel out wash it and iron it cuz you're going to do some wiping of Satan right David prophet of God said David found himself in a bluff that struck me in a bluff he comes up there he walks on the battle scene and and this is what he said David was a very perseverant when he come over the armies of Israel which were standing in a bluff you know what a bluff is a bluff's an attempt to deceive somebody into believing that one can or will do something Goliath was a bluff he was a bluff all the armies were afraid he was a bluff prophet of God so what did he do he raised up somebody out of the Wilderness he went and got a little Shepherd boy that could that believed that God could deliver and when he walked up there he looked at that guy and said looked at everybody said he's bluffing amen he's trying to deceive you into thinking that he can or will do something but he can't he said wait a minute I'm King Hallelujah this guy has not taking my family he's not taking my kingom he's only bluffing he's a Bluff put yourself in the story Satan's a bluff he Bluffs you David was he he was he wasn't uh you know somebody that was well connected he didn't have political connection he he didn't have uh uh he he he wasn't in the spotlight you know God mostly gets people that aren't in the spotlight we got too many people trying to gain the spotlight you know what I mean competition you know what the sin of emulation is everybody thinks that means to copy no it means to try to outdo to outdo it better to do it better we start you know David wasn't in the spotlight he didn't have no military skills if you want to sing a special you sing a special you don't have to have skills I know we've got gifted people and I'm grateful for them but we're all gifted when we praise the Lord when we lift up his Praises he dwells in the Praises of the people you don't have to be in the spotlight look at yourself you're sitting in a church put yourself in the story David was just tending sheep he was faithful to the calling that God gave him to watch his father's sheep right and when the enemy come in he didn't announce to everybody he didn't send out an email I I'm going to kill a lion tomorrow because this Lion's coming in no he just just went about his business he didn't need recognition I'll tell you when we start getting recognition in the church we're taking it away from the Lord Jesus when we start exonerating one another and lifting one another up and praising one another and getting to all that stuff we're just taking it away even James said don't say you'll do this and you'll do that say Lord willing if it be is the Lord's will give God the glory David he he he you know he wasn't in the church main click he wasn't Pals with the pastor in fact you might not even be able to pick him out in the crowd ordinary simple person that was about the business of being a Christian and when he saw a bluff he called The Bluff he wasn't afraid to call the bluff he wasn't afraid to tell Satan what he is a liar a liar amen Satan lies to us yes and that's what that big old Goliath was doing he was lying to the church that's right lying to the elected of God lying and David just said wait a minute I'm going to call this Bluff and goath said I'm going to take this spear I'm going to put you up on that tree and the birds are going to pluck your eyes out David said well I'm not in that world I'm in the world of promise what did David do he went back to past experiences put yourself in the story Wonder maybe God saved you from an injury maybe God saved you from an accident maybe he did something for you even if you went all the way back to the day that he saved you he didn't save you to lose you you put yourself in the story and he said I'm going to pluck you out there and the birds are going to pluck your eyeballs out he said no I I think I don't live in that world the world that I live in says I'm going to cut your head off I don't care what world you're in I don't care what science you're in I don't care what education you're in I don't live by that I live by promise I live by the word of God I contending and fighting for the faith that was once delivered to the [Applause] Saints I believe that every word of God is true and every word of man is a lie that's how I live that's how I think that's how I rest that's how I act I'm not in that world I'm not part of the world that's the other world but it's not my world I've got a different story I'm living in amen he made his stand with the word in closing we could take just a few more this morning but my point is put yourself in the story one of the things the prophet of god mentioned over and over again David was an ordinary man Abraham was an ordinary man there was nothing special about him since when do we have to be extraordinary since when do we have to be Superman since when do we have to be popular I'll tell you I thank God for the brothers in this church I thank God for brother Paul and brother Randy and brother Billy and brother Matthew and the brothers that work with the young I thank God for their Ministries I thought man I don't even have to come home these guys can all preach yeah better than I can don't say Amen too loud I I still got feelings no why because it's the word we're not about personality we're not about places we're about what can we do to further this gospel what can we do to make this gospel live what can we do to to share this gospel what am I doing to further the kingdom of God am I going to throw in the towel or am I going to be persistent am I going to let my flesh rise up a sin in my flesh a sin in my past and I'm going to stop right there I'm going to let Satan build a lie wall and I'm not going to press through it no put yourself in the scriptures the woman that touched the Hem of His Garment she had a personal problem I presume it's not the kind of problem you talk about much and she' done all she could she had spent all her money she's broke maybe you've tried and tried and tried maybe you spent your money on therapy maybe you spent your money on doctors maybe you spent your money on things to make you feel good whatever she spent everything she had and finally she had no hope but maybe she heard about this woman her DET test Tony maybe she saw something else so she thought she would go in there and Touch the Hem of His Garment but you realize she had to fight herself through the crowd to Touch the Hem of His Garment you know many times you have to fight yourself through the church crowd the crowd that's sitting right here the people that you know the way that we act the atmosphere that we're in you got to fight your way through that you got to fight your way past what they'll think you got to fight your way past what the norm is you got to fight your past oh I'm going to make a disturbance oh I might break down and cry I might shout oh no she had to fight she had to be persistent she had to push herself through the crowd all the backsliding lazy unbelief she had to press her way through she had to fight the way through and all she did is said if I could just Touch the Hem of His Garment she didn't even need recognition you don't have to run to the altar if your heart's right you can Touch the Hem of His Garment of course you touch to him a garment it might make you come to the altar right but she was satisfied with that just touching him and that's all she wanted to do when she came to that church service that morning all she wanted to do was Touch the Hem of His Garment she didn't want to sit through a two-hour service didn't want to listen to that balded beard guy for two hours she wanted to touch the ham of His Garment she wanted to touch him she was going to be persistent she was going to press through she was going to everything that was said that she didn't agree with she just spit out the seeds she just kept going there was one thing one purpose one goal on her mind and that was to touch Jesus put yourself in the story amen do we come in church and worry about how packed we are do we come to church worrying about what people think do we come to church or do you walk through that door say I've got a loved one my husband's not saved time's running out Lord I Need To Touch the Hem of your garment I'm here to touch him for you Lord I know you can do a miracle I put myself I watch the miracle you did in Moses I watch the miracle you did in David I watch the miracle that you did in this woman that touched the Hem of His Garment I'm putting myself in the story I'm that woman this morning I'm that brother this morning I'm the one here that touched K you put yourself in the story cuz you're persistent you're persevering you press through the crowd you press through the atmosphere you press through wouldn't it be terrible if that we got such to such Church manners and such a church program and everything just so set in order and and everything that we can't have a [Music] breakthrough that a breakthrough is kind of against our custom our our instant pot roast might get too dry we'll lose all the gravy in our crock pot we don't carry but sometimes you got to press through the church crowd you got to press through the church atmosphere you got to be persistent if nobody else is persistent you're persistent if everybody's going to leave you're not going to leave you're going to do what it takes you're desperate you've got to Touch the Hem of His Garment I think of the woman that washed his feet I love this story because I'm not a woman but I certainly was a man that because every bit is guilty and the prophet of God said as she sat there she looked and she saw Jesus sitting there and and they she saw how he was being treated and she had money in her pocket and she was so moved upon how he just sat there and was humiliated and looked at all those guys making fun of him and she knew they were Hypocrites and she said you know what I can't take this she is going to do something a prostitute ill- famed woman some places wouldn't even wand her in the house of the Lord it just be like if some person would come in here this morning and maybe they don't wear their hair the way we do maybe they don't have their dress as long as we do maybe they have high heels on earrings on maybe they just don't know I question are they welcome or are we oh my goodness look at that brother mcgary's people wear high heels praise God I wish you all had high heels and you all got saved what we want I believe Billy Paul said that that he he never caught a fish that was already cleaned did you hear what brother brandom said in this tape he said we're here to snatch you out of the hand of the devil that's what he said that's a direct quote he said stay and listen we're here to get you out of that to snat you out of that put yourself in the story where are you in the story are you glad she's there are you praying for her to have the courage to lift her hand are you praying for her that she might just step forward to receive prayer are you calling on the angels of the Lord to encamp about them and make a difference in their life or do we fall into some self-righteousness there's no slits in our church everywhere wears Flats in our church there's no makeup in our church well you want to know something we need more makeup not on theel believer they've been washed but we need to bring people into the washing power of the Holy Spirit we need to invite them into a God that loves them and can change their life put yourself in the story how would you like to have been that woman the prophet of God said she sat there with that ointment in her hand and she looked at him and all of a sudden it dawned on her he will know where I got the money from to buy this oh then the reproach then the accusation everybody will know where I got the money what what are people going to think will I get him in trouble will I do this will I do that the old man mind battle started but brother B said she looked at him she said he'll know where I got this money but she said he's the only one that can help me she wanted to be different and there he came and boy they went off didn't they oh if he would know who she was oh she got her money this is how she got the money if he was a man of God he wouldn't let somebody like that touch him she was literally touching the Hem of His Garment washing his feet put yourself in the story sometimes the guilt and the shame you have to fight past the guilt and the shame sure she knew better she probably was in church she knew she was a failure she knew she was dirty she knew all those things maybe Satan does that to you maybe you look at your past but that day she was stepping out of that world in into this world Amen she was no longer going to be a part of that world she was leaving that world she was coming out of that world she was going to enter into a new world because of the blood and the love of Jesus Christ when you put yourself in the story she was full of Shame she was hopeless she was helpless how am I going to pay my rent how am I going to feed how am I going to pay my bills how am I going to do this how I'm going to do that faith says there's a promise amen hallelujah Faith said there's a testimony faith says if God ever does one thing he always will do it the same way her faith said he healed that woman over there he did this for that person maybe she saw blind barus every day when she walked by and blind bar ma couldn't see blind bar ma didn't know what was going on blind bar Ma just heard things but Brian bares has cried out maybe sometimes if we just put oursel in the story maybe you can't see tomorrow maybe you can't see the future maybe you can't see yourself with the husband with the wife maybe you can't see yourself with a job maybe you can't see you have no vision before you you've got nothing put yourself in the story think of blind Barn mayus begging every day hoping somebody would throw something in his cup but he cried out Master have mercy on me it wasn't he didn't hear the cry with his ear he heard the Cry of the heart and anytime there's a crying heart Jesus is on the scene his love obligates him to the scene and there may we could talk about Samson as brother random did you would have never expected it from Samson he didn't look like a preacher he didn't look like a prophet he didn't look like had muscles in fact that's quite a state in saying he was kind of a shrimp kind of a mama's boy with seven curls not what you expect well maybe nobody expects anything from you but God does least he expects you to ask and so I think that it's important that we don't let this world cause us to throw in the towel if they don't want to hear I'm not quit talking I'm not going to quit testifying I'm not going to quit praying I'm not going to quit offering to pray for people I'm not going to quit giving people an opport opportunity to hear I'm not going to let that world change my world I'm going to be persistent in the world I live in to achieve the goals of Faith that's right to achieve Faith a faith that I'm just as happy with the promise as I would be if I was healed amen what an achievement amen what a goal to be persistent to what what a re setting of our mind every Christian must be persistent they must have a goal something they're trying to achieve and I believe I want to achieve the promise father that the faith that was once delivered to the Saints would rest in me that I would be so happy to have the promise just as happy to have the promise from you that promise means just as much to me as my healing this morning because I have 100% confidence that the world that I live in you created for me and I'm living in the world of promise you you put me here you'll keep me Lord I put my heart and my mind and my soul into your hands father let thy will be done we ask it in the name of the Lord let's stand together go ahead and put this on the musicians could come play maybe we could ask oursel a little question this morning have I been perseverance to increase my faith have I have I sought out the promises of God in the word of God cuz by these precious promises we're partakers of divine nature and maybe this morning you would say maybe you're at home and this is just for our congregation today say Lord I've just kind of on the sidelines I've kind of thrown in the towel just a little [Music] bit i' I've been developing an Exit [Music] Plan Lord I've been trying to get out of work instead of going to work I've just thought since I'm just nobody and nobody sees me and nobody recognized me [Music] and that I'm just kind of to the place it really don't matter nobody would miss me and I've just thought maybe I just ought to just [Music] withdraw Lord and I have haven't been very persevering I really haven't had anything set before me that I wanted to achieve Lord I haven't really tried to overcome put an effort into overcoming the sin that so easily besets me Lord I haven't been persevering in applying the token to my life I haven't been pers perseverant in trying to be Sanctified Lord I haven't been very perseverant in laying a pattern of Good Works visiting the Widow and their Affliction and the fatherless Lord I don't even know of one scriptural work that I'm doing Lord I haven't really been very putting much effort in into achieving anything father and I recognize this morning that that's the spirit that Satan's trying to place on the world everybody's talking about a new normal just giving up the old don't even fight for any principles don't fight for nothing just let it all go everything's going to change I ain't joining that world Satan I am not going to become a part of that world I have a world and it's the Bible world it's got Bible stories in it that I can place myself in that story I can make myself the character I can ask myself what would I do how would I think aren't I in the same spot but just in a modern day setting Lord and what you did for David you'll do for me what you did for Moses you'll do for me Lord what you did you will do for my loved ones for my children oh [Music] god father May that Spirit of perseverance may it be enkindled in our hearts once again may we understand that there's supposed to be a book of Acts follow us and I believe it is father because you're the same yesterday today and forever father I just ask this morning you would encourage the people's heart that anyone that feels down may they realize they don't have to be down they feel downtrodden and separated and lost may they know that you care for them Father I just ask that you'd go out and deal with each heart many circumstances but you know them all we just ask father that this morning as your followers father those that have heard The Cry The Eagle scream that we would put our shoulders back that we lift our heads up and we'd look up for our Redemption draws nigh and we would purpose this morning to fight the fight to press the mark to leave those things which are behind behind and press for the higher calling in Christ Jesus we ask for it this morning if there's any one that's sick in body or has a special need on their heart or maybe you'd like to draw closer to the Lord this [Music] morning maybe you feel you've been living in a fog and you just would like to shake free this morning you'd like God to speak to you and give you something to do for the kingdom if you'd slip your hand up to him this morning and you'd say Lord I know my [Music] heart I know that I love you and I know you love me and I've been in such a time of dry spell I've been living in such a desert I've really just been stagnant for so long Lord and I'm lifting my hands to you this morning to ask you to make me alive Lord come my way and assign me a task this morning something I can do for the kingdom Lord speak to my heart I'm reaching out for the Hem of your garment this morning Lord I'm here to wash your feet with my tears I'm here to cry out to you this morning for eyesight Lord Lord I I I'm crying here to bring a loved one from the sin of death back to
