[0:01] [Music]
[0:40] I'm
[0:41] here okay like I was saying we really
[0:44] appreciate brother Tim our Sunday school
[0:46] superintendent all the Sunday School
[0:49] teachers and everybody that worked so
[0:51] hard and especially the children it
[0:53] wouldn't be without them uh it's
[0:56] important you know I'd like just to read
[0:59] this a scripture uh before we
[1:03] start and it it's it's uh familiar we
[1:09] all know the story and it says and lo
[1:12] the angels of the Lord Came Upon them
[1:15] and the glory of the Lord Shone round
[1:18] about them and they were sore
[1:21] afraid and the angel said unto them fear
[1:25] not for behold I bring you good tithings
[1:30] of great joy which shall be to all
[1:35] people for unto you is Born This Day in
[1:39] the city of David a savior which is
[1:42] Christ Our Lord and this shall be assign
[1:46] unto you you shall find a babe wrapped
[1:49] in swaddling clothes lying in the manger
[1:53] and suddenly there was with the angels a
[1:57] multitude of Heaven of hosts praising
[2:00] God and saying glory to God in the
[2:04] highest and on Earth peace and Good Will
[2:08] towards men and you know this is the uh
[2:13] a great time of the year when uh we
[2:18] celebrate the birth and the coming of
[2:21] our savior and that's ex uh just
[2:25] something that's so lost today to the
[2:28] world and I thought thought just as this
[2:30] scripture said Peace and on Earth and
[2:34] Good Will towards men and I think this
[2:37] is just such a great time for our
[2:39] children to learn to love one another
[2:42] and to respect one another and to have
[2:46] good will towards all men whether they
[2:49] see things the way we do whether they
[2:51] believe the season the way we do we can
[2:54] show the love of the Lord and we can
[2:57] have good will towards all men and the
[3:00] gift was to all men whether it's
[3:02] accepted or not but we offer it freely
[3:06] the love of the Lord towards everybody
[3:08] so that this is what we desire our
[3:11] children to know that the Lord Jesus is
[3:14] the answer to all our situations and all
[3:17] our trials and that through him we can
[3:20] have love in our heart and peace and
[3:23] Good Will to all men God bless you we
[3:26] hope you enjoy the service this evening
[3:29] the little program our children have
[3:31] worked so hard and also I know there's a
[3:34] few Refreshments after so God bless you
[3:58] r
[4:59] [Music]
[5:02] friends it's time that men and women
[5:03] woke up to the fact that we want to be
[5:07] one Jesus prayed that we might be one
[5:09] just as God and him were one and God was
[5:12] in and we are one with Christ if we let
[5:14] Christ come in but the only way we can
[5:16] do is to let him take the control room
[5:19] in our heart then we become one amen
[5:22] we're facing
[5:24] Christmas we're facing times we're
[5:27] facing a horrible things all this that
[5:30] we're facing what difference does it
[5:32] make what comes or goes as long as
[5:34] Christ is in the control room
[5:37] controlling us controlling us and giving
[5:40] us Faith to believe things that we
[5:42] cannot see God said we faith is the
[5:46] substance of things hoped for the
