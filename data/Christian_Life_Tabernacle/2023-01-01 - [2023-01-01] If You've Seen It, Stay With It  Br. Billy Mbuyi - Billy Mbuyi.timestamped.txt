[7:30] generation that seeks the Lord
[7:33] a new year
[7:37] seeking him more knowing that he's there
[7:39] for us to lead us every step of the way
[7:42] to just have an unfold himself in our
[7:45] life and to recognize it as a privilege
[7:47] knowing what has done for us every day
[7:49] amen Happy New Year may the Lord bless
[7:51] you we're going to invite with it some
[7:53] Souther to come at this time and open in
[7:54] prayer and
[7:56] there's still a song reading
[7:59] [Music]
[8:05] [Music]
[8:07] morning good morning Happy New Year
[8:10] Mike there's quite a few less of us uh
[8:12] this morning than there was last night
[8:16] it was a blessing to be in the house of
[8:18] the Lord and that overflowing
[8:19] it might take communion together with
[8:21] the saints of God
[8:25] we're going to read a short Psalm this
[8:27] morning but we're
[8:28] sorry you get second string or third
[8:30] string once again I enjoy brother Mike's
[8:33] uh study and his teaching
[8:35] and uh
[8:38] you know it all comes from inspiration
[8:40] of the word
[8:41] and I've often
[8:44] said
[8:45] maybe uh
[8:47] wrongly said it's words to live by
[8:53] it's really not words it's word to live
[8:55] by
[8:56] and we just leave that word
[8:58] appreciate what Brother Andy said last
[9:01] night because she said we take it back
[9:03] to the message at the hour and make sure
[9:05] what we're telling people is the word
[9:08] not just Main bablings and encouragement
[9:11] even they can be fitly spoken
[9:14] but when it's the word it does something
[9:15] for us and uh
[9:19] I would say my intention as it is every
[9:21] year is to spend more time in the word
[9:23] there's benefits and blessings
[9:26] and whatever we have need of it you can
[9:28] open God's word and you apply that to
[9:30] your life it's beneficial
[9:32] and uh
[9:34] you know because you can see
[9:37] without or you can look without seeing
[9:40] you know seeing
[9:42] um
[9:43] kind of gives indication that you're
[9:44] perceiving something right you can you
[9:47] can talk without voicing what you really
[9:50] feel you can hear without listening
[9:54] but we want to be fervent in everything
[9:56] we do and when backed up by something
[9:59] that's alive it makes us more alive
[10:02] amen so
[10:03] I would uh
[10:05] certainly encourage those that are
[10:07] looking for a miracle
[10:09] by this little passage of scripture I
[10:11] want to refer to
[10:13] um
[10:14] you know there's times when
[10:16] you see someone come to the Altar and
[10:18] you think well I really prayed that
[10:20] they'll get their blessing they'll get
[10:21] their healing they'll get their miracle
[10:22] and you feel a little checked you think
[10:24] well if God does something for them he's
[10:26] not going to be able to do it for me we
[10:28] serve a great big God and there's no
[10:31] limit to what he can do
[10:34] and I was reading
[10:37] two different places is covered uh at
[10:41] least two jairus's daughter
[10:43] you know
[10:45] he was a ruler of the synagogue the
[10:46] Bible says
[10:48] and he came down and fell before the
[10:50] feet of the Lord and worshiped him
[10:53] and prayed that he might come
[10:55] and touch his daughter his only child
[10:58] about 12 years old the Bible says
[11:02] she was at the point of death
[11:04] and the Lord says I'll go and he starts
[11:07] making his way to the man's house and
[11:09] there was a great throng of people that
[11:11] surrounded him
[11:13] and he couldn't hardly make Passage and
[11:15] that's when the woman
[11:17] with the issue of blood that had also
[11:18] sought the Lord touched him
[11:21] stop the crowd he says oh somebody
[11:23] touched me
[11:26] and the disciples got and said Lord
[11:27] there's many that touch you but he had
[11:30] perceived that virtue had gone from him
[11:32] he knew someone had gotten their healing
[11:35] and it became evident she had to tell
[11:38] everybody I've searched for years I
[11:40] couldn't find an answer but I had faith
[11:42] and I touched him in the process of that
[11:45] time of all those people
[11:47] somebody came from jairus's house and
[11:49] says no need to trouble the master your
[11:52] daughter's dead
[11:53] you know don't go on over there
[11:55] Lord says only believe only believe
[11:59] and he proceeded to the house
[12:02] and says she's just sleeping
[12:04] said he was going to go in and wake her
[12:06] and they laughed him to scorn think of
[12:08] it
[12:09] but he took his friends his companions
[12:13] his children Peter James and John
[12:16] and the parents of the child and went in
[12:18] and he awoke her from sleep
[12:24] God's not short on time
[12:26] we're short on time we press we move we
[12:29] we scatter about
[12:33] we have a lot of idle time
[12:36] but we always wait to the last minute to
[12:37] get things done
[12:39] but God's always on time
[12:41] so I would encourage you to press in
[12:44] amen and realize that there's no
[12:45] shortage in God's goodness
[12:48] I Just Want To Praise Him and exalt him
[12:50] and be thankful
[12:52] that we do have a place to come set
[12:54] aside for worship of the Lord and if we
[12:56] overflow these walls and we're building
[12:59] a new one next door we'll try to
[13:01] overflow it as well but may this be the
[13:03] the Year of Jubilee for all of us it's
[13:06] going home time let's read together
[13:08] Psalm 100 just a very short
[13:11] psalm
[13:13] we can read in unison
[13:18] there's a couple things in there that uh
[13:22] really are a blessing
[13:25] but I believe the Lord enjoys hearing
[13:27] joyful praise in the midst of Trials
[13:30] troubles
[13:32] sing to the Lord sing the Lord with a
[13:34] loud joyful voice
[13:37] if it's like me it may not be on tune or
[13:39] on key but amen hopefully it'll be
[13:42] motivated by a lot of joy and
[13:44] Thanksgiving
[13:45] hey man let's read it together make a
[13:48] Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands
[13:51] serve the Lord with gladness come before

[14:07] and into his courts with praise be
[14:10] thankful unto him and bless his name for

[57:29] will try not to be too long this morning
[57:31] amen
[57:33] welcome all our visitors God bless you
[57:35] this morning let's open in Isaiah
[57:38] chapter 60 verse 1 to 3.
[57:42] a very very familiar scripture reading
[58:09] I mean it would say arise and shine for
[58:13] thy light has come
[58:15] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[58:17] thee
[58:18] for Behold The Darkness shall shall
[58:22] cover the Earth and gross Darkness to
[58:24] people
[58:24] but the Lord shall arise upon thee his
[58:28] glory shall be seen upon thee and the
[58:32] Gentiles shall come to thy light and the
[58:35] king and Kings to the through the
[58:37] brightness of the rising let's just bow
[58:40] our heads to our father we ask that you
[58:42] bless your word once again to us in the
[58:44] name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen
[58:47] you may be seated
[58:52] man before we get to our subject I just
[58:55] had some uh courts and some things that
[58:58] I I just had in my heart about the new
[59:01] year and I'll just we'd go through them
[59:03] quickly so we can get to our little
[59:05] subject this morning and move forward
[59:07] but random will say he says here tonight
[59:10] uh it says here tonight to hear those
[59:14] testimonies and it says that the
[59:16] different expressions of Thanksgiving to
[59:18] God and I was thinking about us in light
[59:20] of what just happened last night and you
[59:22] know people will give testimonies and
[59:25] we'll say about the things that that
[59:27] went through the year and the things
[59:28] that God had done for them it says and
[59:31] expression of Thanksgiving to God for
[59:34] what's been what has been uh uh what has
[59:38] been to uh
[59:40] it what has been to them through the
[59:42] past year and I want to join my
[59:44] testimony with them I was thinking the
[59:46] sister back there says testify of of the
[59:50] bread upon the water and then it says
[59:52] and then the brothers and brother
[59:54] Slaughter and brother Graham it says
[59:56] talking about uh when the wheels of
[1:00:00] mortal life also all stand still it says
[1:00:03] maybe misunderstood here but uh There
[1:00:07] Before the Throne God knows all about
[1:00:09] these things it says so we're just here
[1:00:12] tonight uh it says kindly I don't
[1:00:15] believe in turning a new page or
[1:00:18] something like that it says just turn it
[1:00:21] yeah just turn it back to the next day
[1:00:23] but it says but if we'll if we'll just
[1:00:26] come and give ourselves to God to
[1:00:29] worship Him and thank him for all what
[1:00:32] is what has been to us and ask him to
[1:00:35] continue to be with us is just about the
[1:00:38] best amen so he's now just telling us
[1:00:41] it's not necessarily about turning in
[1:00:44] new leaves but it's just about the
[1:00:46] recognition of what God has been doing
[1:00:48] you know when you really think about our
[1:00:51] approach of a Believer when we talk
[1:00:53] about what God has been doing it's not
[1:00:55] what he's been doing since your birth or
[1:00:58] since you you you you receive God and
[1:01:01] then you begin to walk oh my it's so it
[1:01:04] goes so far beyond that it goes so far
[1:01:07] beyond what we can even comprehend what
[1:01:10] we see what we don't see to understand
[1:01:12] that everything is being orchestrated
[1:01:14] until this moment yeah that's what
[1:01:17] brings us in such an awe of the god that
[1:01:19] we serve when you come to an
[1:01:21] understanding that he knew all about
[1:01:23] those things and yet he's Gathering us
[1:01:25] together and then he would speak in the
[1:01:28] message context it says now it says the
[1:01:30] beginning of the new year I want I want
[1:01:33] to say not happy New Year to you but I
[1:01:36] want to say this to you God bless you
[1:01:39] and then it says if if he does that he
[1:01:43] says that will be that will have all
[1:01:45] that we have need of for this coming
[1:01:47] year and I trusty will I I believe we
[1:01:50] need to know that we are blessed people
[1:01:52] we're not left alone and and God comes
[1:01:56] around and and and lets us walk and then
[1:01:59] figuring out if we're going to make it
[1:02:00] on our own and then comes drop a little
[1:02:02] blessing here here no the the fact that
[1:02:05] we know God is a blessing the fact that
[1:02:08] we walk with him is a blessing the fact
[1:02:10] that every day we we we recognize who's
[1:02:13] the source of our breath and who's the
[1:02:16] source of our strength and and that we
[1:02:18] walk by him we talk by him it's a
[1:02:20] blessing to come in that knowledge and
[1:02:23] he doesn't even have to do all much but
[1:02:25] just the fact that you understand that
[1:02:27] everything that you have comes from him
[1:02:29] is a blessing in itself and then he says
[1:02:32] I'm by his grace it says we are trained
[1:02:36] this next year he says if he shall spare
[1:02:39] me
[1:02:40] spirit means spare you by his grace I
[1:02:44] hope it says I hope I'm a better Pastor
[1:02:46] next year than I was the year before I
[1:02:49] hope I'm a better servant of Christ it
[1:02:52] says I'll try I'll I'll try to live
[1:02:54] closer it says more truer to bring the
[1:02:58] message as he gives it to me it says I
[1:03:01] will bring it to you at the best that I
[1:03:04] can without not it says withholding
[1:03:07] nothing that he could that he would want
[1:03:10] to give it he says I'll do all that I
[1:03:13] know how and it says I know you feel the
[1:03:16] same way so when we come and and it's
[1:03:20] the end of the year and it's those
[1:03:23] things one of the things it's just you
[1:03:25] it's the expression of the desire the
[1:03:28] bruised within the hearts of a Believer
[1:03:30] when he you come to the realization and
[1:03:33] yet we are and then yes another year
[1:03:36] that God has added and we are here for a
[1:03:38] reason because if it was God was
[1:03:41] finished with us he was not going to add
[1:03:43] us another year but if he gives us
[1:03:45] another year is because we still have
[1:03:47] work to do if he gives us another year
[1:03:50] is because we still have battles to
[1:03:52] overcome we still have challenges to
[1:03:55] overcome we still have to walk into this
[1:03:58] Perfection that is laid before us so as
[1:04:01] Believers every time we are given a
[1:04:03] chance even the scripture says why you
[1:04:05] still have breath in your lungs you one
[1:04:07] to come before God with sincerity you
[1:04:10] want to come before God with this
[1:04:12] resolve that I'm here to believe your
[1:04:15] word and to do all that you have laid
[1:04:17] before me to do and and it says here the
[1:04:20] the Earth is cool enough and and we know
[1:04:23] that the spirit is speaking and the
[1:04:25] church is cool enough and the Revival is
[1:04:28] over he says you don't know what come
[1:04:30] next but we trust that God we trust the
[1:04:33] God for that whatever it is we know that
[1:04:36] God has an answer for it whatever it is
[1:04:38] that's before us whatever it is that we
[1:04:41] need to do we know that our trust is in
[1:04:43] the Lord that he will guide us step by
[1:04:45] step
[1:04:46] he says another place he says as we
[1:04:49] submit ourselves to thee this morning
[1:04:51] the beginning of a new year and ask that
[1:04:54] you will fill us with the Holy Spirit
[1:04:56] and I'll say this as a Believer you you
[1:04:59] just never get to a place where you say
[1:05:01] well I have enough Holy Spirit I don't
[1:05:03] need no more my every day you just want
[1:05:06] every fiber of your being to be filled
[1:05:09] every morning when you wake up you feel
[1:05:11] you need more than you needed the day
[1:05:13] before every day you want to be the kind
[1:05:16] of believer that says that you'll be so
[1:05:19] much hand over to the hand of God that
[1:05:21] the devil doesn't know what to do with
[1:05:23] you and that's what we're walking
[1:05:25] towards and I'll say this some of these
[1:05:27] things the prophet is saying him this is
[1:05:29] even after the opening of the seals you
[1:05:32] would think uh the peak of his ministry
[1:05:34] the greatest thing that ever what God
[1:05:36] promised he opened the seals which was
[1:05:39] the cap of all the things but yet the
[1:05:41] prophet is coming and saying that I'm
[1:05:43] looking forward for more I'm looking
[1:05:45] forward for what God is going to do next
[1:05:47] I'm looking forward for what he has in
[1:05:49] store for us so as a Believer we have to
[1:05:51] be people that are motivated to want to
[1:05:54] see God move to want to see God use us
[1:05:57] to want to see God perfects our life we
[1:06:00] can't just settle and say well you know
[1:06:03] I'll just walk with what I know God I
[1:06:05] want more of you than I needed the way
[1:06:07] the day before it's the desperation that
[1:06:10] brings it to come to pass it's when you
[1:06:12] come to a place where you realize
[1:06:14] there's more to conquer the promised
[1:06:17] land I'll say we haven't even touched
[1:06:19] the things of it of what's in store we
[1:06:21] want to explore every corner of it and
[1:06:24] that we can possess every bit of it that
[1:06:26] God has given us
[1:06:29] he would say it says not turning a new
[1:06:32] page it's it's it's it's turned to the
[1:06:35] word he says see what the word promise
[1:06:38] for today see what the light of the day
[1:06:42] is possessed is supposed to be it says
[1:06:45] we ought to do this what we ought to do
[1:06:47] this year is not to go back to Creeds
[1:06:50] and things go back to our denomination
[1:06:52] not to go back to the old denomination
[1:06:55] and I want to say this oftentimes when
[1:06:57] we hear this our minds goes to
[1:06:59] denomination well go back to Catholic no
[1:07:01] it's going back and being settled in
[1:07:04] what you know it's being oh I've heard
[1:07:07] this before I understand what the right
[1:07:09] messenger is talking no it doesn't want
[1:07:12] you to be settled he wants you every
[1:07:14] time you open the word you're looking
[1:07:16] for fresh manner you want you every time
[1:07:19] you read the word every time you listen
[1:07:21] to the word you are very attentive to
[1:07:24] what God is wanting to speak to you at
[1:07:26] that moment not to come with a mentality
[1:07:28] well like I've listened to that before
[1:07:30] I've heard it before I know what he says
[1:07:33] I know I understand what the message is
[1:07:34] all about you're missing it if you come
[1:07:36] with that attitude but what an attitude
[1:07:38] to know that I'm here attentively
[1:07:41] listening I know I have a situation
[1:07:44] that's that's today I have a need for
[1:07:47] today and God is going to give manner
[1:07:49] for today I want to say this the prophet
[1:07:52] is gone but the message is here to
[1:07:54] answer to the need of 2023.
[1:07:59] you say he was preached in 1960s and all
[1:08:02] of those things but yet there is a part
[1:08:04] of that message that we can use and he
[1:08:07] will answer to the need of today
[1:08:10] through all the nomination by turn back
[1:08:13] to the word and see what kind of what
[1:08:16] kind of light is supposed to shine today
[1:08:19] and then he says oh Church turn to the
[1:08:22] word get back to the word he says flip
[1:08:25] the right switch quick uh it says quick
[1:08:29] punching around on electric light and
[1:08:32] and see artificial main man turn to the
[1:08:35] word and see the promise of today and
[1:08:38] then see what the promise is and watch
[1:08:41] for it identification for watch for its
[1:08:43] identification when it's Vindicated then
[1:08:46] you will know whatever you are whether
[1:08:49] you are in the light or not see what it
[1:08:51] what the promise is you know that's why
[1:08:54] the prophet will come to say God is not
[1:08:56] interested in building boats today
[1:08:58] because it's not the identification of
[1:09:00] today today even as we sit here all the
[1:09:04] message has been wide open to us and so
[1:09:07] marvelous that we've come in such a
[1:09:09] focus and we know every day we work our
[1:09:12] best Believers of this message we know
[1:09:15] exactly what God has promised for us to
[1:09:17] be in this generation we know that we we
[1:09:20] are waiting for our body change we know
[1:09:22] that we are waiting for that Rapture to
[1:09:24] take place anytime we know we are
[1:09:26] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:09:28] sun we know we are waiting for that
[1:09:30] bride to come unto action and to begin
[1:09:33] to do the Greater Works that she was
[1:09:34] promised we know we're waiting for that
[1:09:37] to come so we are not distracted by
[1:09:39] anything else we are not distracted by a
[1:09:42] message of of popularity or message of
[1:09:45] of riches and to to build better
[1:09:48] kingdoms here on Earth and we're not
[1:09:50] interested or in the gospel of how to
[1:09:53] make more money or how to live better
[1:09:55] and how to better your life and be
[1:09:57] healthy and all those things we are
[1:09:59] interested in something that can produce
[1:10:01] a body change something that can produce
[1:10:03] a manifestation of a true son and a
[1:10:06] daughter and and it's what it brought us
[1:10:08] in such a focus that we can look at
[1:10:10] those things
[1:10:11] he says to me I want to see what the
[1:10:15] promise for today
[1:10:18] what's promised for today I want to know
[1:10:21] what the light of this hour is so it's
[1:10:25] bringing it even from a a day to an hour
[1:10:28] saying what the promise for this hour is
[1:10:31] so I can know what to walk in it says I
[1:10:35] want to know where where I'm living what
[1:10:37] age I'm living in and how far up the
[1:10:40] road am I oh my how far are we how close
[1:10:45] are we the scripture says if he doesn't
[1:10:47] come today you'll come tomorrow they
[1:10:49] were living under the expectation that
[1:10:51] any time that promise will come to pass
[1:10:54] yeah we're living under the expectation
[1:10:56] that any day the bodies will be changed
[1:10:58] they were living under the expectation
[1:11:00] from the first stage they thought they
[1:11:03] were the last age and God will send
[1:11:05] another message in another but now we
[1:11:07] know according to the revealing of the
[1:11:09] word that God has bundled everything up
[1:11:12] and we've come and we know that there's
[1:11:14] not another Messenger to come that
[1:11:16] there's not another light to come that
[1:11:18] God is coming as you open up the whole
[1:11:21] book and and we are living in a time
[1:11:23] where he promised that what we have
[1:11:25] heard will change our bodies
[1:11:28] try hey man it says soul for the new
[1:11:33] year be determined to stay with his word
[1:11:37] and what is promised
[1:11:40] it's not a determination to go and
[1:11:43] Conquer everything no I I'm just
[1:11:45] determined to stay with the word if the
[1:11:48] word says it that's all I want to stay
[1:11:50] with if the word promises that's all I
[1:11:52] want to stay with it and to do that you
[1:11:55] have to know what the word says and it
[1:11:57] says like the the like the other elect
[1:12:00] did in other age in other days it says
[1:12:03] or he says if you feel like you've
[1:12:05] you've seen the light that's broke
[1:12:07] through upon you of the Lord Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ his manifestation of his grace
[1:12:12] and and the Holy Ghost
[1:12:14] in This last days it says remember
[1:12:16] remember stay with it
[1:12:19] remember remember stay with it if you
[1:12:23] have seen it stay with it and this is
[1:12:26] you're going to go into what I'm about
[1:12:27] to just preach this morning if you have
[1:12:30] seen it stay with it
[1:12:31] and then he says it says what he did it
[1:12:34] says you and and the other elect and and
[1:12:37] what he the elect of other days like in
[1:12:40] the like like like Abraham and when they
[1:12:43] saw it it says when when when it was all
[1:12:47] against when it was all against
[1:12:49] scientific proof Noah saw it when it was
[1:12:52] all against scientific proof Moses saw
[1:12:56] it when it was all against uh scientific
[1:12:59] proof these smart ages don't gone by but
[1:13:04] the elect saw it and stood firm
[1:13:08] uh so it's not what science can prove it
[1:13:11] we're not here walking by oh science
[1:13:14] said this then we're believable or
[1:13:17] something that the messenger said and
[1:13:19] you wait years after years and oh you
[1:13:21] see the car someone driving a car
[1:13:23] without the driver then you're like oh
[1:13:26] no I believe it because I see it no if
[1:13:28] you have that kind of attitude you'll
[1:13:30] miss it every time the Believers that
[1:13:32] are saving every age are those that
[1:13:35] always believe it before it comes into
[1:13:37] manifestation they believe it and they
[1:13:40] hang on to God's word and they are saved
[1:13:43] those that wait for it to hit their eyes
[1:13:45] are the ones I always miss it those are
[1:13:48] the ones that are always waiting and
[1:13:50] waiting and wait you wait for too long
[1:13:52] but oh if you have seen it with your eye
[1:13:55] if God has revealed it to you walk in it
[1:13:58] don't let it go stay with it believe it
[1:14:02] until it comes to pass because The God
[1:14:04] Who reveals it to you is the god who's
[1:14:06] going to come to bring you the power and
[1:14:08] I think that's why we failed most of the
[1:14:10] time because we think it's our intellect
[1:14:12] that makes us believe it is not your
[1:14:14] inner life it's something that God
[1:14:16] placed within your heart from the
[1:14:18] foundation of the word that believes the
[1:14:21] word without any scientific group God
[1:14:23] believes the word without any
[1:14:25] explanation that believes the word when
[1:14:27] everybody else is running from it that's
[1:14:30] what brings it to pass because the same
[1:14:33] God who made you believe the same God is
[1:14:35] going to come and vindicate your faith
[1:14:37] to show you that you believe the true
[1:14:39] thing
[1:14:43] he says with determination not knowing
[1:14:46] what the New Years hold but we are
[1:14:49] holding to him
[1:14:51] the word it says the word that knows the
[1:14:55] whole he says the word that knows the
[1:14:58] whole Symphony from the beginning to the
[1:15:00] end he knows every movement in every
[1:15:04] Junction we don't he knows we don't and
[1:15:09] then he says God stands on his promise
[1:15:12] on the promised word for each year or
[1:15:14] for each new year he stands on it this
[1:15:18] year to fulfill what has gone what God
[1:15:22] has what is God promised for this year
[1:15:24] whatever it is I want to be right in the
[1:15:28] center of his will
[1:15:30] I don't want to be caught outside I
[1:15:32] don't want to be caught at 10 believer
[1:15:35] well I'll believe more when I say no
[1:15:37] whatever it is I want to be in the
[1:15:40] center of God's will I want the world to
[1:15:43] come find me believing everything I want
[1:15:45] to believe everything that he said right
[1:15:48] from the center of it I don't want to
[1:15:50] come in by the permissive will I want to
[1:15:52] come in by the perfect will I want to be
[1:15:55] in the perfect will every moment I know
[1:15:57] he can work out the permissive will but
[1:16:00] I want to be in his perfect will
[1:16:02] Hallelujah if we can approach if our
[1:16:05] approach for the New Years will be that
[1:16:07] it says for the New Years is is in for
[1:16:10] the New Years so for the New Years is
[1:16:13] determined by God's word just determined
[1:16:16] to stay in his word
[1:16:20] and he he says in in the message Shalom
[1:16:24] he says Shalom God speaks be upon you
[1:16:28] and when God's word is Vindicated in the
[1:16:32] age completely and you see it and you
[1:16:35] believe it Shalom to you
[1:16:38] I love that that's as simple as I could
[1:16:42] ever put it if God's word is Vindicated
[1:16:45] in their age it Vindicated completely it
[1:16:49] Vindicated and you believe it and you
[1:16:51] see it Shalom to you meaning peace be
[1:16:55] upon you you it's done you don't have to
[1:16:57] worry about it anymore you don't have to
[1:17:00] worry about how this is going to happen
[1:17:01] how is that gonna happen if God's word
[1:17:04] is been made visible to you if you
[1:17:07] believe it with all your heart Shalom to
[1:17:10] you be peaceful why because The God Who
[1:17:13] fulfills because remember God is in the
[1:17:16] business of bringing the manifestation
[1:17:18] of people may try to work out the
[1:17:21] manifestation at every Junction they can
[1:17:23] they see something in the word and they
[1:17:26] work it out they work it out and they
[1:17:27] work it out I'll tell you when men do
[1:17:29] that they always come to a failure but
[1:17:32] you believe the word and God God's
[1:17:34] manifestation come upon you when God's
[1:17:37] manifestation come to nothing can change
[1:17:39] it nothing can deny it it comes right
[1:17:42] after the Faith from believing comes to
[1:17:44] you
[1:17:46] it says oh God
[1:17:49] lead us by thy Everlasting hand until
[1:17:53] Victory is finally won
[1:17:58] he's going to give us the victory
[1:18:00] we don't have to go look for victory
[1:18:02] he's our Victory he's everything
[1:18:04] whatever challenge you have he's your
[1:18:07] Victory he wants you to know I have
[1:18:09] victory
[1:18:11] it says
[1:18:12] and Jesus returns through the Earth
[1:18:15] seek it says sin and sick and sorrow
[1:18:18] will be ended and will will leave will
[1:18:22] leave this glorious we'll leave this
[1:18:24] glorious Millennium to these and we are
[1:18:27] we are longing for the for the for the
[1:18:30] great day come Lord Jesus that I were
[1:18:33] today getting that we get get into and
[1:18:36] and and circumcise lips and speak and
[1:18:39] hearts and hears it says may the seed
[1:18:42] Fall Into the Heart where the Holy Ghost
[1:18:46] will sow it and bring forth a
[1:18:48] hundredfold we are asking in Jesus name
[1:18:51] and that's our prayer that we may come
[1:18:54] to a place where the seed falls into the
[1:18:57] ground and I want to say this it's
[1:18:59] important that that seed falls on the
[1:19:01] right ground
[1:19:02] the problem is never with the seed but
[1:19:05] if there is unbelief found in your
[1:19:07] ground you know I I this just came to me
[1:19:10] as I was studying and and it just hit me
[1:19:12] so hard and you know oftentimes we
[1:19:15] wonder well you know they were in the
[1:19:16] message how come they believed they just
[1:19:18] believed it and then how come they
[1:19:19] walked out the ground was not all Faith
[1:19:23] together there was always some
[1:19:25] unbelieved sword somewhere it was always
[1:19:27] something but oh the desires of a true
[1:19:30] Christian is God remove my unmalee take
[1:19:33] my unbelief away that when the seed of
[1:19:36] the word comes I don't want to be found
[1:19:38] with any unbelief I want my ground to be
[1:19:41] clean and it's our job to take care of
[1:19:44] our ground and when we come and we meet
[1:19:47] something that we don't understand we
[1:19:48] take it to him and say God give me the
[1:19:51] answer take my unbelief away I know your
[1:19:53] word has power to do it so the seed
[1:19:56] there's nothing wrong the seed will do
[1:19:58] what the seed was promised to bring but
[1:20:01] oh God if you can take my hand leave
[1:20:03] away
[1:20:04] and I want to say this is this perhaps
[1:20:06] where my inspiration came from and but
[1:20:09] when I'm speaking in the same message
[1:20:10] Shalom it says now what about the new
[1:20:13] years we are facing it says we could
[1:20:15] have more to say on this between the the
[1:20:17] the darkness and the light and to
[1:20:21] introduce the light coming between uh
[1:20:23] the the light coming between but we know
[1:20:25] we want to get right straight to the new
[1:20:28] year he says the new year the New Year
[1:20:30] what about it is this bringing New Hope
[1:20:32] he says we are it says we are one year
[1:20:36] closer we are one day closer and then he
[1:20:39] says we are one day closer than we were
[1:20:42] yesterday we are one hour closer than
[1:20:45] when we started it says 15 minutes to 11
[1:20:48] it says 15 till 11. it says we are one
[1:20:52] one hour closer we don't look back we
[1:20:55] look forward
[1:20:57] our pastor even mentioned we don't look
[1:21:00] back we look forward he said and I want
[1:21:03] to say this uh this came and I'm not
[1:21:06] sure perhaps I've read this before I was
[1:21:09] thinking about it this quote that I I
[1:21:11] heard it came from uh the this lady the
[1:21:14] color uh Harriet Tubman and this from
[1:21:17] the Underground Railroad where they were
[1:21:19] rescuing slaves and they were helping
[1:21:22] them to run and and and things like that
[1:21:24] and she she made the statement that I
[1:21:26] taught it's just been on my heart for a
[1:21:29] while and and she said and this is uh
[1:21:32] when they were helping this slaves
[1:21:34] escape and all those things and she made
[1:21:36] the statement and said to those that
[1:21:38] were running it says uh if if if you
[1:21:41] hear the dogs it says keep going
[1:21:44] and I want you to think about your life
[1:21:47] and and the enemy and the trials and
[1:21:49] everything around you if you hear the
[1:21:52] dogs barking you say oh I made a
[1:21:55] decision for God oh wait and hear how
[1:21:57] many dogs are gonna bark at you it says
[1:22:00] if you hear the dogs keep going if you
[1:22:03] see the Torches in the woods keep going
[1:22:07] oh I see I I believe but now I don't
[1:22:09] understand confusion comes which
[1:22:11] direction do I go if you if they are
[1:22:14] shouting after you keep going don't ever
[1:22:17] stop keep going and if you want to taste
[1:22:21] if you want a taste of Freedom keep
[1:22:23] going
[1:22:24] if you want a taste of Freedom keep
[1:22:27] going and I would just want to speak
[1:22:29] children of of light children of Light
[1:22:31] walk in the light so I want to walk in
[1:22:35] the light keep growing if oh I don't
[1:22:38] understand keep going or I ask God but
[1:22:41] it doesn't happen I waited and now you
[1:22:44] keep going I don't see it clearly keep
[1:22:47] walking if all you can see is one step
[1:22:49] before keep walking if all you can see
[1:22:52] is uh just all nothing and just a little
[1:22:55] bit you keep going if you can't see keep
[1:22:58] walking if you think there's a wall keep
[1:23:01] walking if there's a wall leap over it
[1:23:03] and keep walking
[1:23:05] now as you read a rise and shine and it
[1:23:10] says for the light is coming and and the
[1:23:13] prophet will use this and to preach the
[1:23:15] message Shalom and and he will use this
[1:23:17] to rise and shine and and as we read it
[1:23:20] for the for the light has come and the
[1:23:22] glory of the Lord is risen upon thee so
[1:23:25] here he is he's saying arise and shine
[1:23:27] and and he's saying oh you that come now
[1:23:31] I want you to understand the description
[1:23:33] under which this come because in the
[1:23:37] next verse he's talking about how
[1:23:38] there's Darkness upon the face of the
[1:23:41] Earth and and he says and gross Darkness
[1:23:43] upon the people and he says yes the
[1:23:46] condition under which you are in but
[1:23:48] he's saying to you arise and shine arise
[1:23:52] and shine so in other words whatever
[1:23:54] condition you are in in the condition of
[1:23:57] Darkness God word is here this morning
[1:24:00] saying arise and shine
[1:24:03] you say preacher you don't know what I'm
[1:24:05] going through and you don't know the
[1:24:08] challenges before me and you don't
[1:24:10] understand how much I've tried he's
[1:24:12] saying arise and shine he's saying stand
[1:24:16] up and go stand up and shine don't don't
[1:24:20] sit down keep walking keep standing up
[1:24:23] keep walking keep making one step at a
[1:24:25] time whatever it is it says keep walking
[1:24:28] you said well I have unbelief in my
[1:24:31] heart I say this morning stand up from
[1:24:33] your unbelief and keep walking I I have
[1:24:36] a a condition I that causes me to find
[1:24:40] myself in the same place and it seems
[1:24:43] like I'm running into circles all the
[1:24:45] time I said stand up and keep walking
[1:24:48] arise and shine and and I want to say
[1:24:51] this the word goes and I want to say
[1:24:54] this when he says arise and shine for
[1:24:57] thy light has come I was thinking about
[1:24:59] this even as the uh the prophet will
[1:25:01] talk to us in the message uh uh uh the
[1:25:05] God's power of transformation it will
[1:25:07] say that oh God will come upon the face
[1:25:10] of the Earth and it was all the spirit
[1:25:12] of God moving and the Earth was without
[1:25:15] form and void and he says it's the same
[1:25:17] word it's basically the same
[1:25:19] manifestation when he says let her be
[1:25:22] arise and shine and him saying letter B
[1:25:25] is basically the same thing so when he
[1:25:27] says letter be the prophet comes back
[1:25:30] and he says the sun came out the sun
[1:25:32] dried up the water the sun the sun
[1:25:35] warmed up the ground and the sun called
[1:25:39] the sea to come to manifestation and the
[1:25:42] seed believes the gospel that the son
[1:25:44] was preaching and the seed came out of
[1:25:47] the ground and manifested one whatever
[1:25:48] was already in it
[1:25:51] now when he says arise and shine this is
[1:25:55] not an empty call this is not a call for
[1:25:58] you to wonder how am I going to rise out
[1:26:00] of all of this in other words God is
[1:26:02] calling because there's some ability for
[1:26:05] you to respond to the word in other
[1:26:07] words if you hear this morning arise and
[1:26:09] shine if you hear this morning that the
[1:26:12] word of God has gone forth arise and
[1:26:15] shines
[1:26:18] so God provide his word to us this
[1:26:21] morning and he's telling us that we are
[1:26:23] free we are to stand up and walk we are
[1:26:27] to to be free this morning and to stand
[1:26:29] up and walk from whatever condition we
[1:26:31] are in
[1:26:32] so when we speak about this word arise
[1:26:35] this is what the translation in Hebrews
[1:26:38] and all fourth means he means to arise
[1:26:41] or to rise it means to uh uh to stand
[1:26:49] it means to stand up excuse me
[1:26:53] it means to stand up
[1:27:00] it means to be established
[1:27:03] be confirmed
[1:27:05] be fulfilled
[1:27:07] so when God comes upon Dark Cloud he's
[1:27:11] here it comes to a time where there is
[1:27:13] gross Darkness upon the people and
[1:27:16] darkness upon the earth when he says
[1:27:19] arise is basically telling you it's time
[1:27:23] for you to come to fulfillment it means
[1:27:26] to be set it means to be fixed and I
[1:27:29] like this one Eli it means become
[1:27:32] powerful
[1:27:33] become powerful and it means come on the
[1:27:38] scene
[1:27:39] and God says arise is calling you on the
[1:27:43] scene he's saying that now I have
[1:27:45] recognized the time that you are living
[1:27:47] in I've recognized the darkness that's
[1:27:50] upon the Earth I've recognized the
[1:27:52] condition that the world is in now I'm
[1:27:55] here with a message called Shalom and
[1:27:58] I'm saying arise and shine and I'm
[1:28:00] saying this is the time that the Lord
[1:28:03] has chosen for you to come on the scene
[1:28:08] and he says it to come on the scene it
[1:28:12] also means it to come into manifestation
[1:28:16] to come into the calling or the
[1:28:19] manifestation of what was promised to be
[1:28:21] and like I said it's very important we
[1:28:24] realize that God cannot make this call
[1:28:26] unless there was an ability for us to
[1:28:29] come to it and God's words that's
[1:28:31] calling you that's what is giving you
[1:28:33] the ability for you to rise and shine so
[1:28:37] I say this morning get out of whatever
[1:28:38] you are in
[1:28:40] let's get out of whatever we are in
[1:28:42] let's not judge ourselves powerless
[1:28:45] let's judge ourselves powerful why
[1:28:48] because that's what the word of God has
[1:28:50] called us my brother my sister it
[1:28:52] doesn't do you know good every time the
[1:28:55] word is preached you run it through your
[1:28:57] mind you run into your intellect and dig
[1:28:59] and and take it and work it out and
[1:29:02] divide it and and see how much portion
[1:29:04] of it applies to you no what we need
[1:29:07] this morning is the hearts of believing
[1:29:09] faith and mind that will say if the word
[1:29:12] of God says it I believe it and I'm
[1:29:14] going to walk in it thank you
[1:29:18] arise and shine now it says in Ephesians
[1:29:23] 4 and 5 and 14 it says wherefore he said
[1:29:27] I wake it thou I sleepeth and arise from
[1:29:31] the dead and Christ shall be with shall
[1:29:35] be shall give Delight it says therefore
[1:29:39] he says awake thou that slippers this
[1:29:43] this bride has been sleeping
[1:29:46] this this way the scripture who says we
[1:29:49] were uh dead in sin and trespassing we
[1:29:52] were once the children of disobedient
[1:29:54] but oh the word of God has come to arise
[1:29:57] you to move you out of that condition
[1:29:59] into the light and the word of God is
[1:30:03] here to bring you out of whatever you
[1:30:05] are in so he could bring you into the
[1:30:07] light of God and the prophet will go and
[1:30:10] it says for the glory of the Lord has
[1:30:12] risen upon thee in other words his glory
[1:30:15] is honor his abundance his Splendor God
[1:30:19] has chosen you to be here in order for
[1:30:23] you to manifest his arising
[1:30:27] when you go and you begin to look and
[1:30:30] when the prophet preached this message
[1:30:32] uh perhaps we won't have time to just
[1:30:35] expand it or go a little further in it
[1:30:37] when he talks about the world's
[1:30:40] condition and what we see how how what's
[1:30:43] happening it says there's Darkness upon
[1:30:46] the face of the Earth and and gross
[1:30:48] Darkness upon the people oh the prophet
[1:30:51] will summarize it and I says this is the
[1:30:54] most deceitful age that there ever was
[1:30:58] this it says gross Darkness upon the
[1:31:01] people it says we we live in a time he
[1:31:05] expresses it one place and he says we
[1:31:08] have people that even know what they are
[1:31:10] doing is wrong but they can't help it
[1:31:14] I want you to think about that for a
[1:31:16] moment you know that what you're doing
[1:31:19] is wrong but there's nothing you can do
[1:31:21] to help yourself out of it
[1:31:23] and the reason is because they rejected
[1:31:26] the light I came to get them out and
[1:31:28] this morning we have to be careful when
[1:31:30] the word of God calls us that we don't
[1:31:33] get stuck because remember the call is
[1:31:34] not forever when he calls you have to
[1:31:37] respond you and when you cause you have
[1:31:40] to quickly grab it you don't have to
[1:31:42] hesitate take it whether you feel worthy
[1:31:44] and worthy whatever condition you are
[1:31:46] take the word of God if there's
[1:31:49] something that needs to be done for him
[1:31:51] to clean you let him him do the cleaning
[1:31:54] don't clean yourself just take the word
[1:31:56] oh I I don't care what condition I mean
[1:31:59] I'm taking your word for what he said if
[1:32:01] you call me to arise I'm arising this
[1:32:03] morning
[1:32:05] now it would say darkness and it says
[1:32:08] time where men are trying to be like
[1:32:10] women and women are acting like men and
[1:32:14] and oh my we can go where there's no
[1:32:16] definition of what it means to be a
[1:32:18] woman it's being debated
[1:32:22] people oh they don't want to be uh uh oh
[1:32:25] I don't want to be man or woman I don't
[1:32:27] want you to call me he or she I'll
[1:32:29] choose that to whatever day I wake up
[1:32:31] and how I feel that day
[1:32:35] I mean this is the basic biology that
[1:32:38] can never contradict itself this is not
[1:32:41] some science where you need to sit down
[1:32:43] and teach someone and do some
[1:32:45] calculation this is the basic decency
[1:32:48] the the human basic understanding is
[1:32:52] being lost in people
[1:32:55] he talks about rumors of wars and wars
[1:32:58] and all those things this is the day
[1:33:00] that we are living in he says blind
[1:33:02] miserable rights and naked don't even
[1:33:04] know it
[1:33:05] he talked about men thinking evil
[1:33:09] continually
[1:33:10] oh my we won't even have time to go
[1:33:13] through all of it he will talk about how
[1:33:15] this is Satan's Eden that we are living
[1:33:17] in there's nothing good to be expected
[1:33:20] it's not it's not we can't come here and
[1:33:23] say well you know perhaps the economy
[1:33:25] will get better no they they whether it
[1:33:28] gets better whatever happens with it we
[1:33:31] know it's going down the drain
[1:33:34] they say they're all quiet for peace and
[1:33:37] safety it says when they do their days
[1:33:39] damnation that's about to come right
[1:33:41] after that
[1:33:43] now now God is using that age he's using
[1:33:47] a time like that to come back to his
[1:33:49] people but you he says to you Shalom to
[1:33:53] you that have received the word of God
[1:33:55] in other words it's in time like this
[1:33:57] it's in the condition like this that the
[1:33:59] word is coming to you and saying Shalom
[1:34:02] and peace be upon you it's in time like
[1:34:05] this that the word is coming and said
[1:34:06] arise and shine and let me say this if I
[1:34:10] can just for a moment my brother my
[1:34:12] sister it's important that you don't
[1:34:14] live by but you don't live but the
[1:34:17] economy of the word of the world is
[1:34:19] sorry because if you do you go down with
[1:34:22] it it's important that when the word of
[1:34:25] God says this that we separate ourselves
[1:34:28] from all the things of the world because
[1:34:30] anything we associate with that's of the
[1:34:33] world will go down with it
[1:34:36] because the word of God is here telling
[1:34:39] you that you don't have to do what
[1:34:41] you're doing you don't have to continue
[1:34:43] in that direction you don't have to be
[1:34:45] one that's bound and feel like oh I
[1:34:47] gotta do this and I gotta do this to
[1:34:49] survive when the word of God says arise
[1:34:52] and shine in that arising and The
[1:34:54] Shining that's provision for everything
[1:34:58] amen
[1:35:13] I want to say this
[1:35:15] and the only way we can get to this
[1:35:17] arising in my shining
[1:35:21] is to let the word Direction
[1:35:27] is to take the word at every opportunity
[1:35:29] we are given
[1:35:31] is for us to let ourselves be led by the
[1:35:35] spirit of God
[1:35:36] and I know we have to work we have to
[1:35:38] feed our families we have all those
[1:35:40] things to do but oh if we can understand
[1:35:42] this morning that there is something
[1:35:45] that's greater than you feeding your
[1:35:47] family that's something that's greater
[1:35:49] than you keeping your job and keeping
[1:35:51] the lights on that he who says arise and
[1:35:54] shine he has all that you have need of
[1:35:57] when he says arise and shine he didn't
[1:35:59] say arise and shine go get to do this go
[1:36:03] do that go do that and then come to me
[1:36:04] and then I'll tell you what you're going
[1:36:06] to do next no when he says arise and
[1:36:08] shine it's the giving of ourselves into
[1:36:11] his hands that he may direct everything
[1:36:14] that we are going through because I feel
[1:36:17] like oftentimes we let the things of the
[1:36:19] world stop us even the prophet will say
[1:36:21] we're not our jobs we let those things
[1:36:23] we let God but God is saying I
[1:36:26] understand you have to work I understand
[1:36:28] all of this but I'm calling you to my
[1:36:31] word in my world there's provision for
[1:36:33] you oh if we can take him at his word
[1:36:35] this morning
[1:36:37] amen oh I say this in the world that's
[1:36:41] in complete chaos and complete total
[1:36:44] chaos and total darkness I say this it's
[1:36:48] the word that gives us eyesight it's
[1:36:51] this message that helps us to see
[1:36:53] without it we won't be able to see
[1:36:55] anything let me say this this call of
[1:36:58] arising and Shining went forth but how
[1:37:01] many believed it
[1:37:02] how many received it
[1:37:05] they they they they the word went forth
[1:37:08] it was just music through the ear it was
[1:37:10] nice to their ears they continue in the
[1:37:13] economy they're continuing the things
[1:37:15] that they were doing they continue
[1:37:16] whatever but you are here this morning
[1:37:19] because you heard this call of horizon
[1:37:21] shine
[1:37:22] fry
[1:37:27] oh
[1:37:29] to the Believers I want to say
[1:37:33] the world's condition
[1:37:35] is given for you to you to know that's a
[1:37:38] sign
[1:37:39] it's a sign
[1:37:41] it's important that we understand that's
[1:37:43] a sign
[1:37:45] the scripture will say
[1:37:48] as I say this as I was going to say we
[1:37:51] are the children of light and not the
[1:37:53] children of Darkness
[1:37:54] children of Light walk in the light
[1:37:58] now we
[1:38:01] it's it's him I've always felt like as a
[1:38:04] Believer there has to be certain things
[1:38:06] that cannot be
[1:38:09] uh confusing to you or certain things
[1:38:12] that you have driven us take down that
[1:38:15] you can never come back to change
[1:38:16] anything about it
[1:38:19] there has to be some markers some
[1:38:22] testimonies some things that whatever
[1:38:25] however far you go that if you come back
[1:38:28] to those things you know for a certain
[1:38:30] that this was what God had done for you
[1:38:34] now when the scripture says ye are the
[1:38:36] children of light I don't want us this
[1:38:39] morning some looking at this and says
[1:38:40] well I don't know maybe I'm a child of
[1:38:42] the darkness
[1:38:44] you can't do that
[1:38:47] you said how do you know I'm a Child of
[1:38:49] Light because you're sitting in his
[1:38:51] house this morning
[1:38:54] how do you know because you heard the
[1:38:56] Elisa call
[1:38:58] you heard the message of the hour and
[1:39:00] let me say this if you heard it and you
[1:39:03] are here this morning if this message
[1:39:05] means anything to you you are a child of
[1:39:08] a light
[1:39:10] let's not confuse it let's not take what
[1:39:14] we are and mix it with the challenges
[1:39:16] that we go through let's not take what
[1:39:19] God has called us to be and mix it with
[1:39:21] everything that happens every day if you
[1:39:24] are able under the sound of my voice do
[1:39:26] not recognize that God sends us a
[1:39:29] messenger in this end time you are a
[1:39:31] child of light
[1:39:35] now you may have not come to the
[1:39:37] reasoning or to the full light that
[1:39:39] you're supposed to you have not come to
[1:39:41] the realization of the the full benefit
[1:39:44] of being a child of a life but you are
[1:39:46] warned because God has given you an ear
[1:39:49] for you to hear it God has given you an
[1:39:52] ability for you to listen to it God has
[1:39:54] given you ourself for you to see it not
[1:39:57] everybody sees it but if you can see it
[1:39:59] because you are a child of light
[1:40:02] [Applause]
[1:40:04] and and that's where you begin you say
[1:40:06] God I I know I don't understand
[1:40:08] everything that's in this message but I
[1:40:11] know for a certain that this messenger
[1:40:13] came from you I know that what he
[1:40:16] preached is your word I do I know that
[1:40:18] what he said you will come to pass I've
[1:40:21] seen some of it come to pass I don't
[1:40:23] understand others but I see some what of
[1:40:25] what he said come to pass you are a
[1:40:28] child of a light and I want to see when
[1:40:30] you see that continue to move forward
[1:40:32] you continue to make steps forward
[1:40:35] yes
[1:40:39] oh my
[1:40:41] the scripture will speak and it says in
[1:40:44] Matthew Chapter 5 and 14 it says
[1:40:48] ye are the light of the world
[1:40:57] a city that is set on a hill and cannot
[1:41:00] be hit
[1:41:02] neither do men light a candle and put it
[1:41:05] under a bushel of a bushel
[1:41:08] but on the camp but on the candlestick
[1:41:12] and he giveth he giveth light unto all
[1:41:16] that are in the house
[1:41:20] it said let your light so shine before
[1:41:23] man
[1:41:24] that he may that you may see your good
[1:41:26] works and glorify your father in Heaven
[1:41:30] and I think the challenge around it it
[1:41:32] says oh my good works in everything well
[1:41:34] you start by believing you start by
[1:41:37] walking in it and then your good works
[1:41:40] will will glorify the Father the good
[1:41:42] works doesn't come in Day One the good
[1:41:44] works is heed good works the good works
[1:41:47] is his the more you empty of yourself
[1:41:50] the more you feel it with him the more
[1:41:54] his good works will come to the front
[1:41:55] the more you let him take hold of you
[1:41:58] your more you let him work on you then
[1:42:00] his good works will come to the front
[1:42:02] and then he will say in first
[1:42:04] Thessalonians 4 and 5 it says but ye
[1:42:07] Brethren are not in darkness and and you
[1:42:11] have to say this within your heart I am
[1:42:13] not in darkness I mean the light it says
[1:42:16] that ye should should overtake you with
[1:42:21] uh with uh a thief it says ye are the
[1:42:24] children of light and children of today
[1:42:27] we are not of the night no nor of
[1:42:31] Darkness this is very clear this is very
[1:42:34] specific this is not confusing this is
[1:42:37] the word of God telling you you are the
[1:42:40] children of light and and you say Oh I
[1:42:43] wanna I want but when I'm says if you
[1:42:45] have an inclination if you have a bit of
[1:42:48] a self or part of you that wants to
[1:42:50] serve God or part of you that wants to
[1:42:53] please God if you have even any little
[1:42:55] bit it says then you work from there and
[1:42:58] you let God make it bigger you know I
[1:43:01] was thinking as I was meditating on this
[1:43:03] and oftentimes people will come on the
[1:43:05] prayer line and they will come and the
[1:43:07] prophet will stand there and he will
[1:43:09] lurk them in and it will some of them
[1:43:11] will come and there's no faith at all
[1:43:13] but yet this is the messenger I don't
[1:43:16] want to say this it was just not a
[1:43:17] messenger but we understand that this is
[1:43:19] the ministry of the son of man which
[1:43:22] means the Lord Jesus Christ himself was
[1:43:24] making himself known unto his people so
[1:43:26] they will stand there and he will begin
[1:43:29] to try to raise their faith and by doing
[1:43:31] so he'll tell them where they came from
[1:43:33] he said you live in such and such a
[1:43:36] place and this is your house and this is
[1:43:38] this and you will tell them of the
[1:43:40] condition that they were in you are here
[1:43:42] you are you have such and such condition
[1:43:44] and everything now what is he doing he's
[1:43:47] Shining Light before them he's giving
[1:43:49] them an opportunity to see the light and
[1:43:52] the moment they see the light the moment
[1:43:55] they see the light they says you believe
[1:43:56] that you believe that he said he says
[1:43:58] now if you believe God keep on walk King
[1:44:01] keep worshiping keep praising God keep
[1:44:04] doing this I believe that's the same
[1:44:06] thing the message that's to a Believer
[1:44:07] we come and he calls us to say a sinner
[1:44:11] and all of those things but when we
[1:44:12] stand before him he began to look at you
[1:44:15] and says now I'll tell you something you
[1:44:17] were not just here but you were with him
[1:44:20] in the beginning you were with him I
[1:44:22] seen you over there you were with him
[1:44:24] even before the foundation of the world
[1:44:25] and you begin to see something he began
[1:44:28] to form something he says do you see
[1:44:30] that then continue to walk into it
[1:44:35] but it gets bigger as we walk in it but
[1:44:39] if we are sidestepping today we are in
[1:44:42] it tomorrow we go out it's it's going to
[1:44:45] remain at that size we want it to grow
[1:44:47] so we can become a bigger reality and
[1:44:50] the only way to do is to continue
[1:44:52] walking in it
[1:44:56] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:44:59] it says the blood of Jesus Christ will
[1:45:01] wash us of all unrighteousness he's the
[1:45:04] one who's taking our righteousness away
[1:45:06] where do you know we come to church and
[1:45:08] we are dressed right and we do and
[1:45:10] oftentimes many of us look like holy you
[1:45:13] know they are dressed and all those
[1:45:15] things that's not what interests to us
[1:45:17] that that has no zero bearing to
[1:45:20] anything what we are interested in is
[1:45:22] something inside of your heart
[1:45:24] recognizing the word of God and walking
[1:45:26] inside of it
[1:45:30] foreign
[1:45:33] will say
[1:45:43] he says
[1:45:46] now it must have been about
[1:45:49] that time that Satan looks over at the
[1:45:52] top of the hill
[1:45:54] and after it after it goes dark
[1:45:57] he says
[1:45:59] sitting scare of the light
[1:46:02] he's scared of light
[1:46:04] any devil is afraid of light that's
[1:46:06] right any creeping evil thing is afraid
[1:46:10] of the light
[1:46:11] it says you take a wild animal in the
[1:46:13] jungle of Africa
[1:46:16] or out
[1:46:17] hunting out there
[1:46:20] he says you flush the light they are
[1:46:22] gone
[1:46:24] they are scared of the light
[1:46:26] you get an old Nazi nasty roach and
[1:46:30] throw an apple core down
[1:46:34] out of somewhere
[1:46:35] when it's dark it will come out around
[1:46:38] the nibbling
[1:46:39] just turn the light on and watch him
[1:46:42] take the car for cover
[1:46:44] certainly spiders and everything else
[1:46:47] will take off
[1:46:49] it says they are afraid of the light
[1:46:51] that's the reason people are afraid of
[1:46:53] this old-time Holy Ghost meeting
[1:46:58] we don't see it because we are not given
[1:47:01] the ability to see in those dimensions
[1:47:04] but it's not you you the light we are
[1:47:08] being attracted says he's the
[1:47:10] manifestations of Crisis manifestation
[1:47:13] has attracted your attention but others
[1:47:16] they look at it and say oh I don't want
[1:47:17] anything to do with that they looked at
[1:47:19] it they they they they didn't want
[1:47:21] anything to do with it but to you it's
[1:47:23] attracted you he says they are afraid of
[1:47:26] the light that's the reason
[1:47:28] people are afraid of this old time Holy
[1:47:32] Ghost meeting Children Of Darkness work
[1:47:35] in darkness children of Light walk in
[1:47:38] light he says ye are the light of the
[1:47:41] world a city set up on the hill he says
[1:47:45] don't put a bushel over it now
[1:47:49] and and I believe that's my inspiration
[1:47:52] if I could say it this morning don't put
[1:47:54] a a bushel over it don't come in this
[1:47:57] morning and and always looking down on
[1:48:00] yourself and your inability to do things
[1:48:02] and always looking down on yourself and
[1:48:05] always being negative at every corner oh
[1:48:07] it's my fault and it's this and it's
[1:48:09] this and it's this no don't don't keep
[1:48:11] doing that what the prophet is
[1:48:13] encouraging us as children of light to
[1:48:16] do is when light has been shown out to
[1:48:18] us it's for us to claim it I I say this
[1:48:21] I oh I can't wait until the day us as
[1:48:25] Believers will walk in the house of God
[1:48:27] and when he's speaking of his promises
[1:48:29] or when he's speaking of those things we
[1:48:32] are not looking down at ourselves but we
[1:48:35] are letting the word from the image of
[1:48:37] what we are walking into we come not for
[1:48:40] condemnation but in the realization that
[1:48:43] I've been saved I've been born again and
[1:48:45] what the word is saying right now is
[1:48:47] just my inheritance I'm here to you
[1:48:49] about my inheritance everything that's
[1:48:51] for me I'm here to know about all that I
[1:48:54] need to conquer in order for me to come
[1:48:55] into the full maturity
[1:48:57] that's the attitude we need to have we
[1:49:00] don't need to come and feel like well
[1:49:01] they're going to call out my day so
[1:49:03] they're going to call out for this well
[1:49:04] if you do all those things it's you
[1:49:06] wasting the opportunity for you to walk
[1:49:09] into the light let me say this Facebook
[1:49:12] is not going to bring you into the image
[1:49:14] of God
[1:49:17] our games playing games and all of that
[1:49:19] the news is never going to get you into
[1:49:22] Rapture condition tell me somebody who's
[1:49:24] been gotten ready Enoch was not ready by
[1:49:27] listening to the Daily News oh Russia is
[1:49:30] at War today and not the world economy
[1:49:33] is going down those things were never
[1:49:35] given to get you ready for the Rapture
[1:49:37] those things were given as a sign to you
[1:49:41] that there was a word that was being
[1:49:43] sent to Abraham and his family that was
[1:49:46] saying to Abraham that Abraham will
[1:49:48] receive that word and that word was sent
[1:49:50] for a body change the body changed us in
[1:49:53] coming the economy of the world the body
[1:49:56] change come in the revealing of the word
[1:50:00] foreign
[1:50:03] let's stay in it let's talk about it
[1:50:06] let's make it our daily meal let's make
[1:50:09] it every opportunity to eat it why
[1:50:12] because that's the thing that's going to
[1:50:14] change the molecule of your body you
[1:50:16] know how it will start it will change
[1:50:18] your heart to begin with it will put the
[1:50:20] love of God within your heart it will
[1:50:22] make you love your neighbor he'll make
[1:50:24] you love your enemy it will make you do
[1:50:26] good to everybody
[1:50:30] we don't need more mental understanding
[1:50:33] what we need is the world to come and
[1:50:36] create the love of God in our heart yeah
[1:50:39] that's the manifestation I'm looking for
[1:50:41] I'm not interested in adding up more
[1:50:44] quotes and quotes and quotes I want what
[1:50:47] I've already heard and what is revealing
[1:50:49] to me to come into the reality
[1:50:53] ye are the light of the word of the
[1:50:56] world
[1:50:56] now I want to say this
[1:50:59] the scripture says in John
[1:51:02] that the life was the light
[1:51:06] life was the light
[1:51:09] so before there's a light but before
[1:51:12] there's a light the light comes from the
[1:51:14] life
[1:51:15] so you get the life you are the light
[1:51:19] now he says Jesus is the light of the
[1:51:22] world and he says you are the light of
[1:51:24] the world so in other words the same
[1:51:27] life transfer that was in Christ that
[1:51:30] life has been transferred to you and
[1:51:32] that causes you to be light and and let
[1:51:35] me say this light is for the
[1:51:37] illumination light is to expose the air
[1:51:41] when the world is going in such a
[1:51:43] condition where there's air every day
[1:51:45] your life speaks about a light or a kind
[1:51:49] of life that has to be the right kind of
[1:51:51] Life your light is there to guide people
[1:51:54] in darkness says you stumble all the
[1:51:57] time but in light you are able to see
[1:51:59] where you're going so when the world is
[1:52:01] in chaos God is Raising you up light is
[1:52:05] the source of life
[1:52:10] amen do we really have that
[1:52:15] understanding and the heaviness of that
[1:52:17] is when we woke up every morning to say
[1:52:21] people live because of me
[1:52:27] if you are the life
[1:52:29] if you're the light
[1:52:34] that that becomes your responsibility
[1:52:37] may I say the prophet say that if the
[1:52:39] elect are taken up the what's left is
[1:52:41] the chaos
[1:52:44] I believe I hope I'm not saying anything
[1:52:46] new
[1:52:50] a kind word
[1:52:53] a help
[1:52:55] going the extra mile
[1:52:57] Discerning the needs that's what in
[1:52:59] front of you
[1:53:01] the ability to project the love of God
[1:53:04] the ability to have that sensitivity to
[1:53:07] know what is it that he wants done with
[1:53:09] the word
[1:53:12] are we walking with the awareness you
[1:53:15] know one of the things that we always
[1:53:17] run into and I believe this is the trick
[1:53:20] of the enemy is to always keep us busy
[1:53:22] with our own problems oh I got so much I
[1:53:26] have no time for nobody else you know I
[1:53:28] got so much in my list is so full I go
[1:53:31] back to bed and I haven't finished what
[1:53:32] I was supposed to do the next before the
[1:53:34] day before while my list is piling up
[1:53:39] but is that really what we're living for
[1:53:44] is that really what we we hear God are
[1:53:47] here it's a sacrifice to come to church
[1:53:49] but when I'm calls it a reasonable
[1:53:52] service it's a reasonable why it's one
[1:53:55] who's coming to an understanding that my
[1:53:58] presence here means something my
[1:54:00] presence in this building means
[1:54:02] something to somebody I may not know it
[1:54:04] but to just be able to see faces oh a
[1:54:07] fellowshiping last night we'll see
[1:54:09] people that I haven't seen in times and
[1:54:11] everything to just just to look upon
[1:54:13] them something raised from the heart
[1:54:15] that Joy came in the heart
[1:54:19] to understand that each and every one of
[1:54:22] us your life means something your life
[1:54:25] is not in vain God placed you here to
[1:54:27] pay to play a role God placed me into
[1:54:30] this church to play a role I'm just not
[1:54:32] here as a a checklist or or a person on
[1:54:36] the list that we can count well we had
[1:54:38] 300 people it was included no that I'm
[1:54:40] here for a purpose I'm here to be
[1:54:43] manifesting light I'm here that my life
[1:54:46] May mean something to somebody
[1:54:49] and I'm not just meaning for the church
[1:54:51] body but the world
[1:54:59] we have to come into the realization
[1:55:02] that I am the light of the world
[1:55:05] and if I am the light I'm the source of
[1:55:08] life
[1:55:09] for many people
[1:55:11] but when I most speaking he says
[1:55:16] he was I was reading this about
[1:55:20] about Enoch
[1:55:23] the scripture says in Hebrew 11 and 5 it
[1:55:25] says for by faith Enoch was translated
[1:55:28] that he should not see death
[1:55:32] and was not found because
[1:55:35] God has trans had translated him
[1:55:38] for before his translation he had this
[1:55:40] testimony that he pleased God
[1:55:43] but without faith it's impossible to
[1:55:45] please God for he that cometh
[1:55:48] to God must believe that he is and that
[1:55:51] he's a rewarder of them that diligently
[1:55:54] seek Him diligently
[1:55:59] not just any seeking a diligent seeking
[1:56:02] an Earnest seeking a desperation one
[1:56:06] that understand the importance of that
[1:56:07] seeking
[1:56:10] and I think that's what allows us to
[1:56:13] move forward to grow and to mature is
[1:56:16] when that diligence comes into place
[1:56:19] where as a body we begin to function as
[1:56:22] a member altogether the understanding
[1:56:25] that I'm here not just as a member in
[1:56:28] particular but I'm part of a body and
[1:56:30] I'm playing a role I'm here to be a
[1:56:33] light to somebody else
[1:56:36] you may not say much it may not you
[1:56:39] don't need to come and expand the Bible
[1:56:40] and then you become like no your very
[1:56:43] presence your very essence your very
[1:56:46] just nature your very everything it
[1:56:49] brings something each one each one we
[1:56:51] don't have a testimony equal to another
[1:56:54] each each one of us has a specific
[1:56:57] manifestation and characteristics of
[1:57:00] Christ that no one else can project each
[1:57:03] one has a testimony of things that
[1:57:05] Christ has done that no one else can
[1:57:07] match to them and so each part of the
[1:57:09] building will talk about how God is
[1:57:11] building this building with Lively Stone
[1:57:14] and it says that each Stone will come
[1:57:16] and fit perfectly
[1:57:18] into the building
[1:57:20] will say in the walking the light in a
[1:57:24] message that Tata Church it says Lord
[1:57:26] Jesus we thank thee for these messages
[1:57:28] it stirs us it says looking that we are
[1:57:33] not ashamed but we have kept the faith
[1:57:35] and I pray it says God that this spirit
[1:57:39] will continue to stay in the church Keep
[1:57:43] Us close to one another father keep us
[1:57:45] with you it says Walk Among Us Lord in
[1:57:49] the last Candlestick age that we are
[1:57:51] living in because be our light shine
[1:57:54] forth upon us it says this great time of
[1:57:58] Darkness Lord we re for we realize that
[1:58:01] candlesticks uh the candlesticks and
[1:58:04] stars speaks of darkness and Lord we are
[1:58:07] glad we are the children of light
[1:58:10] walking in the light of God
[1:58:14] we are not Earthbound with these things
[1:58:18] of the Earth but we are children how we
[1:58:22] thank thee for these things
[1:58:26] it's something to Rejoice about when you
[1:58:29] realize you are children of light
[1:58:30] there's a responsibility that comes with
[1:58:33] it it's something I Rejoice I know I'm
[1:58:36] in the position to do something
[1:58:38] I'm in the position where God has
[1:58:40] blessed me in order to affect something
[1:58:42] he continues on and says
[1:58:45] we thank you we thank you for sending
[1:58:48] these messages as confirmation of your
[1:58:50] word may you always be honored Among Us
[1:58:53] father may you keep us okay may you keep
[1:58:57] us from all bitterness of the earth keep
[1:59:00] us Sanctified to our lives well till our
[1:59:05] lives will pour and will be pure and
[1:59:08] clean and holy before you he says let
[1:59:11] the blood of Jesus Christ do this for
[1:59:14] every one of us Lord it says it says uh
[1:59:19] we says take take from us
[1:59:22] if there is anything that's not of you
[1:59:24] right that's not right it says take us
[1:59:27] from Lord take it from us it says Lord
[1:59:31] this is the hour of searching time
[1:59:34] these meetings these meetings meant for
[1:59:37] that purpose to search our heart you set
[1:59:40] them flames of fire your eyes search how
[1:59:44] to know the reins of the heart certainly
[1:59:46] do father and then it says speak back to
[1:59:50] us and tell us
[1:59:52] telling us what how it makes make
[1:59:55] yourself ready
[1:59:57] that your hour is arriving
[2:00:03] but when I'm talks about a story of
[2:00:06] perhaps if the musician could come and
[2:00:08] I'll close around here
[2:00:12] he talks about a man who
[2:00:14] who didn't believe in Divine Healing
[2:00:18] I'll read it quickly and the man comes
[2:00:20] to him and says one time I was down in
[2:00:22] Kentucky and I was having a meeting and
[2:00:23] an old fellow came out and said oh I
[2:00:26] don't believe in healing
[2:00:28] I said well
[2:00:29] it's your right you are an American
[2:00:32] he said I don't believe anything unless
[2:00:34] I see it he said well it's right it says
[2:00:37] it's all right it says now I ain't got
[2:00:40] nothing against you but I don't believe
[2:00:42] what you are saying
[2:00:44] but when I'm responded it says it's your
[2:00:47] own American privilege you don't have to
[2:00:49] now I never accepted nothing unless I
[2:00:52] can plainly lest I can see it plainly it
[2:00:56] says well that's good for that's good
[2:00:59] you must you must be from Missouri it
[2:01:02] says I'm I'm a Kentuckian who it says it
[2:01:06] says don't sound very good as I don't
[2:01:09] sound very good contagion but I said
[2:01:11] anyhow I said that's the way you think
[2:01:14] and then that's the way you think go
[2:01:16] ahead it says how how are you going home
[2:01:19] he said I'm going across the hill I live
[2:01:23] over it says we'll go we'll go over me
[2:01:26] it says nice man it says go home go home
[2:01:29] with me and stay all night said he says
[2:01:33] I wish I could brother but but I said
[2:01:36] I'm going up uh with my with my uncle
[2:01:40] and he said
[2:01:42] you want to ride over I said no I got to
[2:01:46] go up across the hill up there
[2:01:48] and this way and down the holler and up
[2:01:51] and and and down over there and he said
[2:01:54] how are you going to get there he said
[2:01:58] I'm going up the path
[2:02:00] listen to this
[2:02:02] why I said
[2:02:04] you can't even see you can't even see
[2:02:07] your hand before you
[2:02:10] I said how are you going to get out
[2:02:12] there
[2:02:14] he said I got a lantern
[2:02:19] he said I said and I said
[2:02:22] what do you do he says light that
[2:02:26] Lantern and then walk with it
[2:02:30] he said yes sir I said when you light
[2:02:33] that Lantern
[2:02:35] can you hold it up a higher like this
[2:02:39] I would like to see your home
[2:02:42] he said you can't see it
[2:02:46] so from where he was standing
[2:02:48] to where his home was even if he would
[2:02:51] hold the lantern in front of him he
[2:02:54] would still not be able to see the home
[2:02:55] now
[2:02:57] I'm one that don't believe that these
[2:02:59] are just stories
[2:03:03] this is a message in a nutshell
[2:03:07] this is but random will preach well
[2:03:09] preach well preach and then we'll give
[2:03:10] you one example that summarizes
[2:03:13] everything that he's been trying to say
[2:03:16] I said
[2:03:19] he said I can't see it
[2:03:22] I said then how are you going to get
[2:03:24] there
[2:03:25] oh he said
[2:03:27] I'll just light the Lantern and walk and
[2:03:31] I walk I walk as the light it says I
[2:03:36] walk as the light I'll just walk it says
[2:03:39] I'll walk just just
[2:03:41] I walk just as the light does he says I
[2:03:47] just do that
[2:03:48] just walk in the light so in other words
[2:03:51] he's saying I'll just put the light in
[2:03:53] front of me and as the light is shining
[2:03:57] I'm seeing the steps that I'm making and
[2:04:00] it will lead me home
[2:04:01] and I listen to whatever it says now it
[2:04:04] says just keep walking I know he says
[2:04:07] don't stand still you never you never
[2:04:11] you never get nowhere you'll you it says
[2:04:14] if you if you've been saved walk to
[2:04:18] sanctification you say how do I get
[2:04:21] there just
[2:04:23] keep walking
[2:04:25] now and I think this is this is this has
[2:04:28] to be very critical because don't ever
[2:04:32] get this courage and stop the stopping
[2:04:35] is what the devil wants you to do and I
[2:04:38] don't care at what level you are the
[2:04:40] moment you stop moving that's what the
[2:04:43] devil is looking for the moment you stop
[2:04:46] you're gonna regress there's never been
[2:04:48] anybody who's stopped and never went
[2:04:50] anywhere this is this is moving this is
[2:04:53] a movement that goes forward the moment
[2:04:55] you stop he calls you back the moment
[2:04:58] you stop things that were behind you
[2:05:00] start creeping back in things that you
[2:05:02] taught you had overcome they start
[2:05:04] showing up why because you stop it's
[2:05:07] from sanctification to justification
[2:05:09] from justification to sanctification he
[2:05:12] says in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:14] after sanctification how do you get that
[2:05:17] just keep walking in the light the light
[2:05:22] is provided as a path for you to go you
[2:05:25] keep walking in the light the light will
[2:05:27] take care of what you need the light
[2:05:30] will provide the path for you to walk in
[2:05:32] oh I want to say this morning is the
[2:05:34] start of a new year I don't want to ever
[2:05:37] stop I want to continue on from wherever
[2:05:40] you stopped with the Lord you can you
[2:05:42] take another step you continue to walk
[2:05:44] you continue to walk why because he's
[2:05:47] the one who's taking you to the Finish
[2:05:48] Line if he provides the light he's going
[2:05:51] to continue to provide a life and you
[2:05:54] keep walking in the light that is
[2:05:55] provided
[2:05:59] speaks about the children of Israel yeah
[2:06:01] they are
[2:06:02] and they have questions hard questions
[2:06:05] how are they going to overcome the
[2:06:08] Promised Land
[2:06:09] how are they gonna they are untrained
[2:06:11] men and not soldiers nothing and they're
[2:06:14] going into battles with Kings and and
[2:06:17] all kinds of armies and great armies and
[2:06:20] histories that were known and all of
[2:06:22] that how are they going to get out of
[2:06:23] Egypt
[2:06:27] it's not for you to know how you're
[2:06:29] going to get there you just believe what
[2:06:32] God had said God is responsible to get
[2:06:34] you there
[2:06:35] all right
[2:06:37] now
[2:06:39] you you think about not scientifically
[2:06:43] proven
[2:06:44] the the very first fact that God came to
[2:06:47] Moses a light at a bush a burning bush
[2:06:51] and fire that it was a contradiction in
[2:06:54] itself it didn't start with any
[2:06:56] understanding of a man how can a bush
[2:06:59] that's not a waiter that's not that's
[2:07:02] not dried or anything God takes it and
[2:07:05] lights it up and fire and it's not
[2:07:07] consumed
[2:07:09] hey explain that to me scientifically
[2:07:13] there was no way now because Moses
[2:07:16] believed in the god of the impossible
[2:07:18] because Moses did they believed the god
[2:07:21] of the impossible math and impossible
[2:07:24] understanding he was able to stand there
[2:07:27] and he kept walking yeah they all stuck
[2:07:29] between the the army of pharaoh and the
[2:07:32] right sea and God looks at them and says
[2:07:34] I didn't tell you to stop I told you to
[2:07:36] keep walking was that in which direction
[2:07:38] and said oh keep walking towards the sea
[2:07:41] now there were they had better odds if
[2:07:44] they were to fight the army of Egypt
[2:07:46] then they were with the Red Sea
[2:07:50] my brother my sister let's not take the
[2:07:52] things of God and try to understand it
[2:07:54] with our mental ability Let's Take God
[2:07:57] as in his word let take him for the
[2:07:59] promise that is given it's up to him to
[2:08:02] bring the promise if you promise it he's
[2:08:04] going to bring it to pass
[2:08:07] I say this morning let's keep walking
[2:08:11] I don't know what you're going through
[2:08:12] you keep walking you keep adding one
[2:08:16] stone you keep adding this you keep
[2:08:18] adding you keep letting the light shine
