just approach you at this portion of the service we're thanking you for your grace and your mercy that you have shown unto us Lord knowing if it wasn't for that many of us wouldn't be here but we'd be maybe just a number or statistic maybe be incarcerated or just out in some denominational some worldly situation but Lord your great love we're in we you loved us Lord you've called out to us Lord and you've drawn us out from the things of the world Lord and you've shown us your wonderful truth and you've transformed our lives Lord and you've given us quickening power or that we could live an overcoming life Lord and it's been the greatest joy that I believe we could all testify is knowing you Lord truly Lord there's nothing that this world could ever offer that could even come close to the joy of knowing you we just pray that this little service now that you would just receive the glory or it may you bless the reading of your word bless the word as it would go forth Lord and we ask that you would break the bread of life as only you can do we just surrender ourselves to you now your precious name the Lord Jesus Christ we pray a man praise the Lord if you have your Bibles will be reading maybe we'll just read Zechariah 4 7 the scripture just came on my heart as I was on the way to service and so I I just feel to read it I'm not sure we'll get to maybe the the types and the prophecy in this scripture but zechariah 4 7 through 10 it reads who art Thou O great mountain before zerubabbel thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands to also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of Hosts hath sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole earth a man you may be seated and just what struck me just as I was thinking of the scripture that came on my heart as it says that and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings crying grace grace unto it and we have received a message of grace we believe we have received our headship Christ the word has come to the bride and this last days and it cried grace grace it's not something that we have done it is it is a message of grace that men have trampled it underfoot as the Prophet would say and have made it a disgrace it's not by your works it's not by anything that you can do but it is truly a message of grace it's something that he has done and as we maybe just move forward in this message tonight that's really maybe an underlining thought it's something that God is doing in you it's something that God is doing through you it's something that God has spoken of you and really our place or our position in the whole process is believing what he said that that's what we do we're believers and so maybe tonight we just want to encourage you because you know the scripture says there it says who has despised the days of small things of the Prophet would pick that up in the breech and he would say simple things and he would say who has despised the day of simple things as he has opened up of this series of sermons preached in the seven seals he opens it up with preaching God hidden in simplicity and revealing in the same and he takes the rouble for it says the this day of small things is the day of simple things and I just want maybe for us to really focus on our personal lives and and on our congregation in our church and what God is doing in our assembly in our lives in our family what we might call simple it might be the day of simple things but this is this is where the whole climactic accomplishment that God wanted to accomplish down through time is in your life right now look the Prophet is common in and has brought us the message and he has introduced us to Jesus Christ and now we are in a union with Christ and we're in this journey and so now it's it's our part to play we have a part to do now and I think it's so easy for us to to in this lady you'll see an age just to get caught up in life you know and and we start to if we're not careful we start to despise the day of small things and the day of simple things as we go through the our daily routine and everything so as we would just bring the word forth we we want to just apply that personally to our life we'll be reading out of Mark 917 now and we're thankful that our pastor had a successful procedure we're certainly anxious for a quick quick return mark 9 17 through 24 says in one of the multitude answered and said master I have brought unto thee my son which hath a dumb spirit and wheresoever he taketh him he tarath him any FOMA 'the and nash's with his teeth and pine it away and i spake with the disciples that they should cast him out and they could not he answered him and saith a faithless generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming and he asked his father and he asked his father how long is it ago since this came unto Him and he said of a child and often times that have cast him into the fire and into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do anything have compassion on us and help us and Jesus said unto Him now notice he's he's he's put he's putting something back on this man if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straightway the father of the child cried out and said with tears lord I believe help thou my unbelief and the Prophet says in perfect faith he says the disciples had power Jesus gave them power to heal all manner of sickness to cast out devils to cleanse the lepers to raise the dead he gave them power but they didn't have faith to operate the power that they had and then they questioned Jesus and said well now why couldn't we do it now remember they had the word and the word was flesh then and the word told them I give you power amen give you power and they had the power but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them my say brother Matthew this isn't sounding encouraging so far we'll just stay with it see what I mean but Jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will I suffer you he had faith with his power how did he he said I can do nothing in myself why he relied upon what he was he relied on knowing what he was the word and he had faith in God who made him the word he was God the word and it was in him and that give him faith because he understood his position he knowed what he was because the Scriptures had said he was this and here every scripture tied in to prove that he was exactly what the scripture said he would be and he knew what he was therefore he relied upon what God had made him and if he did that then can't we rely upon what God made us as believers is there anybody in here that can testify that God has made you a believer many times we come to situations and we come to things in her life and there's only one thing we know to do and that's belief we don't we can't figure it out we can't add it all up we can't try to offset this scripture or balance it all out the roles we could say Lord is I believe your word I believe Lord you said we're believers he said these signs shall follow them that believe he had faith in what he was and if you are a believer you have faith in what you are you are a believer and if you've got faith in God the Bible says over here if our hearts condemn us then we can't have faith but if our hearts don't condemn us then we have faith we have confidence towards God but as long as you're doing things that's wrong you can't have confidence towards God so you'll automatically know that you're wrong you automatically put yourself back there a sinner by knowing that you're wrong but when your heart don't condemn you and you know you are a believer and there's nothing between you and God and you can ask what you will and know it'll be given because it's the word that's given to you just like to those disciples now the only thing you have to do then is have faith in what you are have faith in what the word says you are and I just pray that as the word would go forth tonight that maybe as believers we can just set our wings to the winds of faith and that as the word would go forth that we could just start to rise into the heavenlies and we can start to soar in heavenly places in Christ Jesus because you are a believer you are an eagle and that's what you were born for you are predestinated to soar in the realms where all things are possible to them that believe and so we just want to start believing in what God has told us we want to believe in what we are we are believers and I know that we've been immodest and maybe we have heard for year upon year upon year of love that we're the bride of Jesus Christ and and we're without spot and without wrinkle but I think maybe that if that needs to be mixed with a little faith tonight that we actually start believing what he said about us that we are that 90 army that we are that bride and we start to believe in who we are that we can do the greater works that you can lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that you can stand upon the promises of God that if you see somebody that's been bound by a spirit that you have a right according to the Word of God to take God at His Word that to say to this mountain be plucked up and go over here that's that's what you've been called to that's who you are this is the office that goddess chose to manifest himself in in this day is you the bride he only has hands as you yield your hands he only has a mouth as you yield your mouth oh you're the final voice in this generation and and now by the word we want to start having faith in what God has made us but I believe many times we feel like I like this father did oh Lord I believe but help my unbelief and so we just want to maybe look at how many times in our journey in our walk we could find maybe ourselves a two-sided we could find ourselves a lord I believe but help my unbelief but I just maybe want to encourage us to look at the part that believes because there's always something that's going to discourage you there's always something that's gonna go ahead and pop up there's always gonna be something that the devil can take and bring to your attention where all of a sudden you start to question if you believe so I want to say that if we believe let's no question that we believe let's go say Lord I believe your word but but either something in me I don't understand what it is look if there's something between you and God tonight let's make it right let's get down to business I say that many times men Oh Oh bye we don't want to miss an opportunity with God we don't want to miss the opportunity of the Holy Spirit I'm passing by your way tonight you don't have to live another night in bondage no you do not have to you can take God at as word you repent of your sins repent of the things that are wrong in your life have you done something wrong to a brother you don't something wrong to a sister if he said something that wasn't right look let's just don't carry these things around we want to have the right attitude towards the Word of God we want to come into this place expecting God to do mighty things I often think of what kind of expectation we would have and no doubt rightfully so that if the prophet or William Branham was standing behind the pulpit and I believe that God has raised up a bride with a faith in his word that will still accomplish the same exact thing because he said so prophet me would time anytime say if Jesus Christ was standing on this platform wearing a suit I often chuckle at that because he pretty much was that many times God was there availing himself in a man and saying if Jesus Christ was up here wearing a suit right now he could no more heal you tonight because He healed you 2,000 years ago can't we stand in the same place tonight upon that divine promise knowing that by its stripes we are healed just believe believe what he said don't look at the circumstances don't look at the obstacles don't look at your family situation I know it looks like it's a wreck and it looks like it's not gonna be able to be mended but I just want you to place all your trust place all your hope and the Word of God knowing that he has it all under control just trust in him the scripture says in 2nd Corinthians 4:18 it says while we look at the things which are seen while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal you know we can't help being the these vessels that we are trapped in these little pest houses that we have these five senses that contact our earthly home here and so everything really that we we come in contact is really temporary and and it's easy you know to to look at the things around us and maybe put confidence in them or or be swayed by the situation's around us but you know all of these things are temporary the government's temporary your jobs temporary look your health is temporary if the Lord continue or Terry's if the Lord tarries this this tabernacle we will go by the way of the grave but the inner man Paul said I delight in the inner man because Oh My look at he found a law that ward within em you know what the things I want to do I don't do and the things I don't want to do I find myself doing he said all who delivered me from this vile wretched man that I am but he said I find that I delight in the inner man and that's what we as believers want to delight and we want to delight in that holy spirit and the believer that you are and feed on the things of God not looking to the things that are temporal but looking to the things that are eternal and those are the things that are unseen which we could just plainly state that that's God's Word we look to God's Word maybe you can't see it but by faith you believe it and by that sixth sense it's a substance it means more to you than these five senses could ever my because how many of us have done I made a decision because faith in the sixth sense as anchored in the word and it's contrary to the other five senses it's like you are crazy why would you ever do that why would you move why would you quit your job why would you make this kind of decision because you're living by the unseen you're not living by the temporary things around you you're not basing your journey upon the flesh and upon your job and all of those things around you but you're basing it upon the Word of God and what he said as a believer we know the scripture familiar says heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away and I just ask you tonight maybe what are we trusting in what are you believing in what type of investments are you making with your time and what things are you applying yourself to and you find many times that we're giving in to the things that are temporary the things that are not going to accomplish anything for any eternal value and so we just want to do to just surrender ourselves in such a way where we're so died out that we're so in tune to the Holy Spirit that we're being led maybe I would ask the question how many when's the last time that you you can say in your heart that you felt the leadership of the Holy Ghost in your life that you truly felt a divine nature come upon you and influence you in such a way that you knew it was God moving upon you to make a decision that's not to bring any condemnation it's to let you know that we are led by the Spirit of God and I would say we should hunger and thirst for righteousness knowing that we would be filled in his Holy Spirit is here to be a guide and to lead you in all truth in all righteousness that's what I desire I desire to be led you know it's easy to get in a routine we're all guilty of it I mean we got our routine and we got our even even you know even even serving the Lord construction right this is when we go to church this is when we pray this is when we do devotions I got God in a nice little box I got my work in a nice little box I got all my little bills in a box and you're just over there delegating and everything just set up and you're just running a good little show yeah well I don't know if you've ever been there but I have but I think we need a step back sometimes and really get shut away from the things of the world and I believe you'll start to find out that we have needs in our congregation that you don't even know exist and that you can start entering into a prayer and you can start entering into an interceding and God can start dealing with your heart in such a way that also a brother or sister will come on your heart so strong you don't even know why and you find out they're living in sin you find out they're not living right come on church what where is God at he's not some somewhere way off in the sky if God is going to lay his hands on somebody he's going to use your if God is going to speak alert of life to him he's going to use your mouth to do it some people are in a place where where they're having such a hard time opening the Bible or turning on a tank now that we need somebody to stand in the gap that will be in prayer that can intercede for them on their behalf that God could direct you on the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord and you can go on down the way you speak just the right word to bring deliver it's doing oh we're a living Church where a body when you start looking around I want to say don't despise the day of simple things let's don't take it for granted something that just struck my heart we we know that our church has such a great love for one another but I just thought mine could could we all of a sudden take it for granted where people are slipping through the cracks and people that we love and hold dear maybe we've kind of just chunked up there there are routine chopped up their behavior and maybe the way they're going about things just to just to the way it is not realizing that something in their life is trying out for help and we could help be the solution we're a family and that's how Satan works he tries to carve us out from the from the family he tries to put in a little wedge and something be said and maybe something be said just a certain way we're all of a sudden an individual feels that offended they feel hurt and all of a sudden they find the joy of going to church is it there anymore and all of a sudden they're in a struggle when it comes time to go to church or maybe they packed themselves along a few times but then maybe when they would fight through some of the difficulties to find themselves in the house of Lord that the one day that difficulties they're just that little extra knife that's jabbing into their side where they were hurt maybe by something sad or something was misunderstood they just feel like you know I I can't do it today and what we want to do as a family is not get self-righteous and lifted up I can't believe them look at them I mean my good and we don't want to just use church attendance as I mean look as a family of God we want to have fellowship outside of these four walls we need to be in touch with our family than just just the two times during the week I don't know about you but we need fellowship we need to strengthen one another we need to fellowship around the word this shouldn't be the only time we fellowship around the word it's when the words going over this pulpit know about that the word should be constantly upon our lips we should be reaching out one to another we should be fellowship in other things we should be we should be talking one with another like I brother what do you think about this scripture it's good to come together and speak about these things because it's in times like that that God is ministering to the body we know the scripture says for he that soweth to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth to the spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting that's Galatians 6:8 pretty straightforward scripture if you so do the things of the flesh you're going to reap it so we want to be sowing to the spirit we want to be about our father's business we want to be looking to the word what does the word say about it look we believe in a rapture we believe in the changing of our bodies we believe in divine healing but you know we stagger at that many times we find ourselves right back in that place as this father going Lord I believe but help my unbelief and I just pray that by the word going forth tonight that you will take faith in what God made you God made you an overcomer he made you an eagle he made you to take the pressure of this age whatever situation that you're going through right now you were born for it he made you for it it's not too big you're not gonna break under the pressure because somebody else is handling the pressure for you he got you in the palm of his hand he's not gonna let you go I want to encourage you that what are you spoken of you he's going to see that he makes it through he's not a just didn't call you and pick you up and bring you on this journey and then when everything just got so tough where you just might I just can't take it anymore that Jesus I was a year on your own I I just I just thought you would react different no he saw the end from the beginning and he brings us through these times of testings because what is it doing it's molding you and it's making you and it's shaping you bringing out that character that that dross is being beat out in your life and and and you're being molded and we know that everything is for a purpose but truly many times as believers we feel like lord I believe but I shop so I'm struggling right now I'm struggling right now I want to encourage you tonight the scripture says in Romans 6:14 for sin shall not have dominion and over you for sin shall not have dominion over you what is sin unbelief unbelief will not have dominion over you for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace unbelief is not going to have dominion over you so as the word is going for it I want you to start looking at who you are and to realize that this little thing that pops up over here that says you know what all of your faults and all your failures you know you just don't believe you heard what he just said even the disciples were given power and all this things they look you don't even believe that's why that's why you haven't been healed that's why your family situation hasn't been fixed that say you believe but you got all this unbelief over your unbelief will not have dominion over you the word of the Lord is coming to you tonight to tell you that unbelief is not going to have dominion over you it's not going to define you it's not going to define your life it's not going to define the situation that you're going through because you are a believer and you believe God's Word and you're standing upon that word no matter what the devil says no matter how he how he throws all the trash in your face and he tries to call to remembrance all the things that you went through and he's trying to show you see oh you believe but there's this unbelief there's this other side and that's exactly what the devil's wanting you to do he's wanting you to get your eyes off Calvary he's want you to get your eyes off the Lord he's wanting you to look over this way at the flesh to look at the things that are temporary but the word is coming for telling you sin will not have dominion over you you keep looking at the word have faith in what I made you I made you the bride I made you without spot without wrinkle and keep your eyes on the promise and everything will come to pass oh he says for sin shall not have dominion over you for you are not under the law but under grace you imagine living under the law that's a terrible way to live you think of how helpless that would feel and I haven't taken the time to go through it all I mean it's almost intimidating there's a lot of laws there's a lot of things to keep there's a lot of food they can't either they got to dress a certain way and and my I tell you what brothers or sisters if you feel like being a believers taxing well for for one you just just get the Holy Spirit and it won't be but you want to talk about taxing living under the law there was so many things that they had to adhere to and they had no power to perform it and so all they could look forward to at the end of the year was to go uh-uh take the sacrifice and that would just be a substitute wouldn't be a finished work but it would be a substitute a covering which we know it was a type of Christ to come but could you imagine living under that kind of bondage but you know what's sad there's many people that are living a Christian life or who are believing this message that are in that exact situation look I want to tell you that if this message is a burden to you you're in bondage if it's hard for you now now don't misinterpret a struggle if you're if you're fighting praise God you keep fighting you keep believing I know how it is if if you find yourself moving towards of the things that are right but then you find yourself going back you just keep pressing and you keep believing that's wonderful if you're in a place uh-uh-uh-uh-uh where you're believing and God has placed it on your heart and you believe them and now you're in a place of sanctification where you're not living like and you're in a struggle praise God that's okay you keep fighting you keep believing and you keep taking taking God at His Word and he'll bring you all the way through but if you've just been going through the motions for so many years and so you're just trying to walk the line just how short can I make my dress and how high can I let the split go and how can I do my hair and all these things all my I've heard at all you know we're not supposed to cut our hair so we'll burn our hair we won't burn our hair we'll break our hair and that's a real struggle we shouldn't belittle it either because I don't know what it's like god bless our sisters that have a revelation to know what the word says and that it's pleasing to our Lord god bless you for that I won't belittle the struggle because I don't know what a slide I don't know what it's like for them spirits and those things to move upon you and the pressure of the age for the women to present themselves so I don't belittle that at all but I want to tell you you can come to a place where it's not a burden he said come unto me all your heavy laden and I will give you rest oh when you come to know him in the power of his resurrection this word in this appearance such a Liberty you say Lord whatever I can do to serve you whatever I can do and I'll lay down my life if you want me to wear dresses down to the floor I live down the floor if you want me to grow my hair long I'll grow my hair long Lord if you want me to clean up my life and you want me to stop going over to this place if you want me to stop fellowship with these people Lord whatever your will is for my life Lord I surrender it all to you whatever you have for me and then now you know the scripture says where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty oh my never experienced such Liberty and all my life is serving my Lord Jesus Christ oh I've been in bondage to the test master of the world and he's a hard taskmaster sin will take you farther than you ever want to go oh that's bondage but oh if you could just give your life over into the hands of those nail-scarred hands those sweet tender loving hands of Jesus he'll pull her to his bosom and you start to take all the sea and all the strife and all the scars and all the hurt and you pull you close to you to us Muslim you say it's okay I know I know what you're going through and you'll feel that burden you'll feel that despair and you feel those things just will start to lift off your life and you'll find such a sweet Liberty in serving a life to Jesus Christ why but you find people serving this message you know and say well brother I got a right to dress how I want to I got a right to choose when I come to church I got a right to do these things I've got a god-given right to dress the way that I feel I should dress no you don't know you know the Prophet says you surrendered your rights you're a land your to bear rule your to believe that's what the work that's what the Prophet said so then when somebody offends you you don't have a right to hold a grudge when you see something that you don't think is just meaning that you don't have a right to catch judgment on that situation and hold yourself and some self righteous in the nation you don't have a right look love covers a multitude of sin you don't have a right to hold up in your heart if something is keeping you out of the house of God I believe that you're a believer I believe in what God told you what you are make it right don't live like that any longer Oh Satan will deceive you into thinking that you have a right to act the way that you're acting our only right is to surrender to him and whatever his will for our life is be it unto me according to thy word oh praise the Lord when that Holy Ghost comes my there's nothing like it there's somebody anyhow that's been born again whoo that gets me excited because I know what it's like not to be born again and I thought I was living man I just thought was alright but you know there was something inside of me that couldn't get satisfied there's something just kind of eating there and so you feed it with all the things of the world and you find out that nothing in the world will ever satisfy it look you're a peculiar person you're an oddball you find out why some people are successful and they can just carry on and live the way they are maybe a halfway christian profess the name of the lord and they get all the blessings like what's wrong with me look you're just an oddball your inheritance isn't over here your inheritance is glory but Satan's always wanting to bring you back under the law he's always wanting to point out your faults in your failures but I love how Paul says in Romans 8:1 he says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus have made us free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son and the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh look I don't care how far you've gone there's power in the blood well there's power in the blood since things are lost in its life-giving flow would you be free from your burden and pride oh there's power in the blood oh my I know this sounds simple sense but it's the most powerful thing that you could ever come in contact with oh the pillars power in the blood of Jesus Christ brother branham says out of Christ the mystery of God revealed he said that's God's purpose for Jesus Christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws and fulfill his law by death Christ God died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the Word of God and not swap it like Eve did for intellectual conceptions of men we're back to believing what the word says look we we I don't know if we'll get to it but it's easy for us to look into the word and recognize the prophets position recognize the disciples position to recognize the messengers position but when it comes to us we stumble at it when it comes to our position in the word and what God has made us and that's what we open the service with is having faith in who you are and it's having that type of confidence and faith in what the word has made you that we're talking about believe only that word don't swap it out don't don't let this other thing come up here and start to to attack you and you start looking away and feeling a little less of yourself no you just stay right with that word for proverbs 3:5 says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding and all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path not part of the ways in all thy ways I just want to maybe look at this you know a lot of times we go in circles and our Christian walk maybe you've been going in a circle with battling something or you've been going through a cycle of where it's maybe every six months you find yourself coming up against this same temptation maybe it's a couple weeks or maybe it's every five years I want you to know that God is allowing you to come up against that obstacle again because you are an overcomer and you are going to overcome that because sin will not have dominion over you and God by His grace I early in my Christian walk I found that many times when I might stumble to something or fall I realized that I was not given my time do the things unseen to the eternal things but I was giving too much time to the temporal things and all of a sudden I might find that I wasn't guarding myself or I find I was given too much of my time too something and then I realized well what did you expect you let down the bar and I want to tell you that if if there's something I believe the Lord speaking to you now if there's something you keep coming against and it keeps discourage you in heaping condemnation on you it by the word there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus and that sin is not going to have dominion over you so now take the faith that God has given you rest in the promises of his word and next time that devil shows us how'd you take it off and when you take it off do like David did you you testify of the victory we're a victorious Church and we don't want to act like we're so high and lifted up that none of us are going through any battles or any childs we're living in lady I'll see the darkest age there ever was we got young people who are trying to live sanctified lives of the most wicked age there's ever been I don't want the young people to know I'm proud of you I'm so proud that you would come and you'd sit on the front rows and you would give your heart to God you serve them and this wicked age I'm proud of you I want you to keep pressing the battle we need you we need your testimony we need your strength in the church I'm proud of you you keep it up oh it's such a testimony to our church don't let the devil beat you down just because the word goes forward that maybe your struggles with some praise God your struggle with it overcome it keep fighting keep believing until you put that down below under your foot for the last time Oh hallelujah one of these glorious days we're gonna put death under a foot we're gonna go in a body change oh I can't wait for that day but it's coming hallelujah but I was just thinking about going through these cycles and as our pastor he mentioned not too long ago about uh uh the scripture you know we've never passed this way before and there as Joshua was getting ready to cross over the Jordan uh Joshua took the ark which represents the Word of God and you put it out in front of the people and said now follow the ark it's gonna take it's gonna take you across Jordan this is what you have to do and that's as believers what do we do we follow the word we believe the word and if you've never passed this way before if you've never been baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit you have a divine promise essentially picked up your sins be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you put that word you put that Ark out right in front of you and you keep taking footsteps footsteps are possessing you stay right behind that word and you watch God confirm his word and come back that up with the power of the Holy Ghost in your life oh that's what he does he promised it just keep believing it [Music] we stumble at it though God hide in himself in simplicity we stumble at it to think that God is veiling himself in your skin and you're the one that has to get up with the guy every morning and you're like really Lord I believe but help my unbelief you know sometimes you feel like God where are you at I feel like I'm all on my own but praise God for that sixth sense called faith that in the face of all the doubt in the face of all the confusion there's an anchor there there's something that says Lord I believe your word Lord and though all of these things are coming against me and I just seem like I'm barely holding on lord I know it's you that's keeping me I know you're the one that's holding me Lord if it was up to me on my own strength look where would we be if it was up to us and then we start to realize it's His grace it's that message of grace that's come and that's called you and that's keeping you the prophet of God says and in the invisible union of the Bride of Christ she says now maybe this is just a part that we're familiar with but let's have faith and who you are we're going to read this and this is speaking of you brother Branham in the invisible union of the Bride of Christ 1965 this is November 25th one of his last messages he says this is my message to the church now as we go off the air in just a minute you are standing if you're standing on God's Word and with God's Word every Amen every jot every tittle where are you standing I am trying to tell you pull away from them shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can get right before the Sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place hallelujah talk about a thanks kid I feel real good I am more thankful for that than anything I know of you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of the Son of the Living God and every man and woman that is born of the Spirit of God and washes has washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect you are perfect you are perfect oh my brother Matthew that's only a terminology that's that's reserved for Jesus Christ where do you think you came from she is him you are perfect you are the perfect word being made flesh in the end time you are perfect half faith in what God made you oh it's not just words to make you feel good about yourself all right the scripture says do do we sin because grace abound god forbid but it's time that the bride of Jesus Christ has faith and what God has made you you are perfectly dialed that bring somebody deliverance because if I had the enemy I'm fine eats all kind of condemnation on me he heaves all kinds of faults and failures on me he's always wanting to point out the weaknesses oh but when you look to Jesus Christ when you come to your headship Christ your mate he looks right at you through that sin for that blood of Jesus Christ he says you are perfect oh you talk about a revelation that's been brought you're talking about the catch don't come and saying grace grace look the brother branham shows so plainly what it means you're not just forgiven he shows so glad I was if somebody if you are carrying around some baggage but you made some decisions in your life and you feel that you've been scarred and you feel such condemnation like you can never be repaired or something has just been the devil's just been jabbing that into you and it feels like it's been holding you down the Prophet said now look if if if if I stole $20 from Cosman I'll pay you back later and he came and forgave me for it well I would be forgiven but I wouldn't be justified right is that is that is that how he said it but if he came to me and said look brother Matthew I forgive you for taking for stealing that 20 R's like what are you talking about I never stole $20 he's like okay but I forgive you oh do you realize do you realize what the shed blood of Jesus Christ has done for you when you are lost by the blood of Jesus Christ you never sinned in the first place he said he goes back in it spin back on the devil you never did that the devil did it you never did it in the first place you are forgiven not only forgiven you are justified that's what the Prophet could stand there said you are perfect because you never sinned in the first place oh my when you catch that revelation then you can start walking in the truth of what God is wanting to manifest in this last day you can start having faith in who you are when you realize what the power of the blood has really done for you you're not just forgiven you're justified you never did it in the first place oh here comes the headship the capstone coming crying grace grace grace you never send in the you are the pure sinless virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you are perfect Oh hallelujah doesn't that make you feel good thank you Lord Jesus Oh glory to God praise His name amen we'll just find a place to close oh thank you Lord for his blood you're not just forgiven I just pray you can catch the revelation you don't have to hold that burden any longer Church you don't have to hold that condemnation any longer you didn't do it is that not what he said I want to ask you who said that I wasn't a man william branham that was the creator of heaven and earth who descended to reveal himself to arrive they said you are perfect although we stumble a simplicity that's exactly what the whole church world did they stumbled at the simplicity of the Lord being made to manifest before him just like when Jesus Christ came all brother Brent says that hid their polish too hard he come down and he bypassed all of their religious seminaries he bypassed the Sadducees he bypassed other Pharisees I what he did he bypassed all the way down to just a simple humble little version who said be it unto me according to thy word by past all the educated bypassed all the scholar Lee's and then we see these Wars Lane in the scripture that says oh as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the days of the revealing of the son of man all men had probed at it for years and for years and for years and they probed at the revealing of the seven seals and wondered oh my how could this be and people had it on the other side of the tribulation and maybe some had a little truth here and some had a little truth here but there was something laying in the scripture that said at the sounding of the seven angels message when he begins the sound all the mysteries in the Bible shall be finished all the middle did the world know there in 1933 in a little place called Jeffersonville there was a little mud pit out in the middle of the field and there was a little young man who was about to be went to his first life over there and he was caught up in a vision in 1933 and he come out of that vision and the Lord says read 2nd Timothy 4 maybe we ought to read it this has been burning me up for a long time think of it now God hiding himself in simplicity here this written would a brother man who preaches God hiding himself and simplicity he talks about how God came to a simple farmer like Noah starts going all the way down through hell God's always hiding himself in simplicity the church world and everybody else stumbles at it but God is hidden and simplicity and I just by God's grace if we don't run out of time I want you to understand that God is making himself known in your simplicity don't despise the days of small things you are maybe a simple little group though but you're the very apple of his eye you're everything that he would take Calvary and die for you are his achievement that is achieved in this last days you are perfect and here the Prophet comes out of a vision in 1933 2nd Timothy 4 brother Branham it's about 6 o'clock in the morning here he's not to lay the cornerstone at the tabernacle I don't know what was just a little my bed and he's he's going to lay the cornerstone and he's it's about six o'clock in the morning he's caught up in a vision and only he's sensing you as he tells us in present stage of my ministry in September I believe it is in 1962 he's talking about oh and I was caught up in a vision kind of the tabernacle looked like it was just no actually it starts out by the by the Jordan River where John was baptizing but we won't break all this down because it's just wonderful but he's at the tavern he goes oh I'm so thankful for my Tabernacle with the angel or says this is not your tabernacle and he takes him down and sets him down before the the great blue sky and this vision unfolds to him and he comes out of the vision it says read 2nd Timothy 4 and he comes out of the vision he grabs it and the prophecy as I read I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom hallelujah preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time shall come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall keep to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of evangelist make full proof of thy ministry here the Prophet is standing there in September of 1962 and he says this this scripture has been fulfilled he said but it wasn't here until last May in Southern Pines that I actually read the rest of the scripture he said just like Jesus when he picked up the scrolls and he only ran it to a certain point because the other pertained to a second coming and he's now pointing out that the rest of 2nd Timothy 4 is pertaining to the crowning of brother branham's ministry and he goes on any preacher serves as this the end time and why is he preaching the service because all of the prophets life there's been something calling him to the west oh now I don't you to miss God hiding himself in simplicity here comes a little boy from a moonshine family packing - took - to help produce liquor and alcohol a world little catches up on when he's seven years old and speaks to him and gives them a Nazarite vow says you shall never drink or to file your body in any way for you have a work to do when you get older God hiding himself and simplicity didn't come to the big denominations didn't come to the big seminaries and here this boy goes along and now he has a call of God on his life and and everything's calling him out west and he's standing here saying it serves is this a time look I had a vision in 1958 that when I saw a peg drove down to my road that I was supposed to be obedient to a vision and go west and he said that's been happening now I'm being obedient to the vision and he starts to explain how just eight days earlier on December 22nd 1962 that he was caught he was caught up in a vision and in this vision y'all bear with me i but you I apologize if this is just for me blurry but on December 22nd he's he's he's this is a really instrumental time December 22nd because there's been six dreams that have been brought to brother Branham about him going west and so brother random knows the time is coming is drawing nigh and then now he his vision of 1958 has been fulfilled in he knows he's going west and he's now he on December 22nd he's caught up in this constellation of angels but first he saw like these two little Bert these little birds coming he's a little veterans little birds come and they sat down on the bush and they kind of made a constellation like a little pyramid and he says then another they flew off and another group came and they're a little bit bigger and he said then all of a sudden like out from eternity must have been five no more but seven just there's like not even a bad of an ayah but at weekly and all sudden they were there and I was caught up and there's a big blast and what does this mean he's like Oh could this be those seven thunders and he's preaching this message with an honest heart saying could this be is this where we're at could this mean that the revealing of these seven thunders that men have broke that all down through the scripture could this be where can you imagine the church world hearing some uneducated man who grew up in Jeffersonville Indiana and turned some mud bed into a little Tabernacle standing there Sam is gone calling me for this great monumental revealing of the seven seals all the church world couldn't stand it God hiding in simplicity and there he goes out according to being obedient to a vision he moved there in about the first week of 1963 to Tucson Arizona and he climbed up there in the mountains of Sabino Canyon and why he was praying there and Street searching the heard something came down in his hand something struck his hand and he says Oh like it could have been a dream why I can't say but as I know there was a soul and I thought a king sorry said no the King's sword and that the Lord spoke to him and said this is this this is the revelation of those thunders those seals this is the vindication of your ministry go back and preach those seven seals now here comes a man a little humble man comes back to this little Tabernacle in Jeffersonville Indiana and is standing there preaching God hiding himself in simplicity and there he's standing preaching the breech and saying I'm at his mercy you know you know I'm if he don't come I'm waiting on him who was it that came and broke themselves who was it that took that book out of my hand I sat there in the throne all they looked in the scripture brother and says it's the most sublime thing ever in scripture that here the title Dean was sitting in the hand of the one that sat upon the throne and now Jesus Christ the Son of God that said as the mediator for seven church ages now is coming forth to claim his rights to claim when he died for to claim what he bought to claim his perfect bride and he comes and takes the book he takes the book and he descends with an open book in hand what are you telling me I'm telling you that was fulfilled on a little mutt bed in Jeffersonville Indiana for your sake Christ had come and not only redeemed you but he's taken you all the way back to what Adam and Eve lost now you can say to this mountain be thou removed God hiding himself in simplicity if the musicians would come but it doesn't stop their church behold I send you Elijah this message is for you this message revealed to you that you're sinless this message revealed to you that you're perfect don't despise the days of small things Christ is being veiled in your flesh the Prophet was the first one to maturity he was a sheath wave he was one that came to maturity showing what Christ had accomplished and now there's a whole wheat field coming up right behind it saying glory to God I believe in what you made me I'm going to set my wings to the winds of faith maybe you could play that oh my the prophet of God would say there and God hidden in simplicity he would say that if Moses it loves us under the shed blood of bulls and goats can be put into position to call for the plagues and call for the Flies he said why would you stumble why would you stumble at the bleach blood of Jesus Christ that could sweet squirrels into existence why would you stumble at a church why would you stumble on little fishie I give you back your life well I'm gonna be a Hattie right I'm gonna say that's nothing but the truth I believe it with all of my heart now wherever this message takes me I want to go just like that Ark crossing over the Jordan said you've never passed this way before I'm gonna tell you Brian you keep following this message I don't think we've gotten in a body change before I don't think you've ever gone in a rapture but I want to tell you there at your cycle started maybe you've never crossed over but I want you to set your wings to the winds of faith you keep following this message because in a moment in a twinkling of an eye will be changed let's stand oh don't stumble at it Church [Music] don't stumble at what God's made you set your way [Music] I just want to read this real quick mother random preaching present stage of my ministry he reads the rest of this second Timothy four [Music] he's labored to show that there's a transition that's taking place in his Minister if you follow it through there's this climax there's this third pool there's was something that's that's coming he says now this is this is the time was when men are forsaken Paul said demas has forsaken me he shows how people are even saying brother man is all washed up do you think about this in 1962 when he's preaching presses take to my ministry he's been preaching this gospel for 30 years no aina comprehend the toll now they have comprehend the tens of thousands of visions no way to even come close to having an idea what it's like and now for 30 years he's been preaching it and all of a sudden he's coming to a transition in his ministry which is going to be the crowning of his ministry it's going to be those seven seals it's going to be those mysterious thunders and now he reads this he says in verse 7 verse 6 he says for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I fought a good fight I finished my course I've kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing all I'm thankful what did the prophet of God point out II I believe it's an anointed ones at the end time he said who was it that appeared down there on the Ohio River who was it that appeared there in the Houston Coliseum in 1950 that wasn't me that was at the southern angel that was the son of man that was Christ oh we're living in the glorious time so simple but when you go through these revelations now when you go through the word only believe all things are possible does it have to be something big mysterious but maybe in saying this just to conclude half faith and who you are [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] isn't that wonderful did you stink them out of the whole world even God will choose the people like us I don't know about you but I could say about myself tonight I could just look back and and see all this wonderful revelation all this wonderful mystery and this great things that people have gone to school to study and become theologians and and people just like in the Old Testament and in the time of Jesus they've dedicated their lives to robbing and and and born in the word and born in the churches and home of that but yet it will choose just such a a people from no word that it would reveal himself what is simplicity just it just makes me my heart just to sink in and just say Oh God I don't even know why me but I believe like our brother said I believe they said there's so much against us but all faith is for us tonight there's so much in the world you could look and try to add it all up and say it's absolutely no way but he chose you but I said it's you that I want you to understand this in all this mystery is me coming down and the sword and the revealing of the seven seals and and all the stings and all that not despising of the day all of those things is just for you let's just bar heads tonight our gracious father we shall dine for Lord to just come to a place or garden do you just hear what we heard tonight no garden how do you would call a messenger out of nowhere in how they you would choose him to come in to bring such a powerful message and be rejected by all the churches and that you had a predestinated group of people that you knew they would believe it but we feel like our life don't even come into the light of what you've given us but we believed in I but we believe Oh God and we pray Lord that the word will produce what you call that slaughter but we are sinless because you said we are sentence we are perfect because you said we are perfect whatever you said is what we hang on to is where we put our lives into Lord because we realize the insignificant that we are but we understand that it's the Creator who spoke the word and will believe it bless us tonight bless better Matthew as he brought forth the worded note for all of those that have heard it tonight bloody just makes us to realize how small we are and how great your word is it and I pray tonight Lord that if we went astray and if we need that baptism of the Holy Spirit whatever we have need of Lord those that are here knows that our home know that you just so sweetly come today by our way and fill us once again so we may come back into the fold Lord that even that we can even get to a place Lord that our life making just manifest the things that you heard tonight lead us and guide us Lord you the great Shepherd of the flock there's not a one that's gone astray that you couldn't bring into the fold we ask that you leaders then you guide us tonight but our hearts are full o comes I see you'll be with us tonight bless the people as we depart from this place we love you in Isis things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ hey man you
