[11:59] we were here to worship Him this morning
[12:02] brother Mike if you just want to come up
[12:03] on our service and prayer this morning
[12:05] there are some reading
[12:09] [Music]
[12:13] let's go ahead and break
[12:16] Heavenly Father were always so grateful
[12:19] to you for every opportunity Lord to be
[12:22] invited into your presence Lord we thank
[12:24] you that a way has been made Lord an
[12:27] entrance has been Minister that we might
[12:29] stand before you blameless that we might
[12:32] sit at your feet and learn of you Lord
[12:34] that meant we might dwell with you have
[12:36] you in our midst and us with you that we
[12:38] might hear from become like you be drawn
[12:41] to you Lord to be transformed and
[12:43] changed from day to day Lord we commit
[12:46] this service to you Lord that your
[12:48] spirit would overrule in every way
[12:50] Lord we as a people take control of any
[12:52] spirit that would stand in the way of
[12:54] the delivery of your work and the
[12:56] receiving of your word and the
[12:58] transforming power that I agree may your
[13:00] spirit alone have rulership and Dominion
[13:03] in this place we commit the service and
[13:05] all of the instruments all of the all of
[13:07] the activities within to you that you
[13:10] would overrule in every way Lord come by
[13:12] our way and meet every need be precious
[13:14] to each one of us when we pray this in
[13:15] Jesus name Amen so though the lot has
[13:22] fallen to me it seems to to do today's
[13:27] song you know it's funny was mentioned
[13:31] to me very casually in a meeting of
[13:35] several brothers and over the years you
[13:38] learn that that's about all the notice
[13:39] that you get so you come prepared if you
[13:43] want to turn to Psalm 65 this morning
[13:48] you know is just kind of looking at this
[13:51] Psalm a little bit in particular verse
[13:53] and it stuck out to me is verse 4 and it
[13:57] says this it says blessed is the man
[13:59] whom thou chooses to and causes to
[14:02] approach unto thee that he may dwell in
[14:06] thy courts we shall be satisfied with
[14:10] the goodness of thy house even of thy
[14:13] holy temple you know and I got to
[14:16] thinking about that I got to thinking
[14:17] about a dwelling place you know a house
[14:21] is where someone dwells you know in this
[14:24] scripture is speaking of his dwelling
[14:26] place his courts his house
[14:29] his temple all describing a place where
[14:32] he dwells you know anytime you enter
[14:35] into someone's dwelling place you're
[14:37] only there because someone has invited
[14:39] you in otherwise you're a thief right
[14:42] and how precious is it to have that
[14:47] invitation blessed is the man whom thou
[14:49] chooses and caused us to approach unto
[14:52] thee you know it's interesting as David
[14:55] describes his dwelling place in in
[14:56] chapter 65 the very first verse
[14:59] references the name Zion you know it's
[15:03] it's an a it's a it's a place that you
[15:06] could do a whole study on and it's
[15:08] mentioned several times in Scripture you
[15:10] know it's it's mentioned simultaneously
[15:11] as a city it's mentioned as a mountain
[15:14] it's mentioned as a people you know it's
[15:17] a place where his kingdom is established
[15:19] it's a place where that he as the chief
[15:23] Cornerstone as late as the foundation of
[15:25] it quoted many times in the New
[15:26] Testament it's the place where the
[15:28] Redeemer and the redeemed both dwell so
[15:31] I mean you can do a whole study on that
[15:33] but one thing that's really interesting
[15:34] about it is Zion is a dwelling place
[15:36] it's his dwelling place right in Psalm
[15:39] 132 12 it says for the Lord hath chosen
[15:42] Zion he hath desired it for his
[15:45] habitation
[15:47] so Zion is both a place of his choosing
[15:49] and it's a place of his habitation but
[15:53] then it says in Isaiah 12 6 cry and
[15:55] shout thou inhabitant of Zion for great
[15:59] is the Holy One of Israel in the midst
[16:02] of thee ok so there are others who dwell
[16:06] there he dwells with them in this place
[16:10] together that dwelling place blessed
[16:13] city is the man whom the Lord causes to
[16:17] come in and dwell with him right
[16:18] and Isaiah 10:14 it says it says it
[16:22] speaks of my people that dwell in Zion
[16:24] Joel 3:17 says so shall you know that I
[16:28] am your Lord the Lord your God dwelling
[16:30] in Zion so it's not just the dwelling
[16:32] place of the Lord it's the dwelling
[16:34] place of his people the cohabitation of
[16:36] the Lord with his people blessed is the
[16:39] man whom thou chooses and causes to
[16:42] appro
[16:42] unto thee and I think the thing that's
[16:44] the most exciting about this dwelling
[16:46] place is it's not a future dwelling
[16:47] place it's a present
[16:49] dwelling place psalm 27:4 says one thing
[16:53] have I desired of the Lord that will I
[16:56] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[16:59] of the Lord all the days of my life this
[17:03] life right to behold the beauty of the
[17:06] Lord and to enquire in his temple you
[17:10] know it's it's what's interesting is you
[17:12] can't go to that future dwelling place
[17:14] unless first you dwell in this dwelling
[17:16] place but one is a reflection or as we
[17:19] heard Wednesday night a pattern of the
[17:21] other right in fact Jesus said when he
[17:24] was teaching his disciples how to pray
[17:25] in Matthew 6 thy kingdom come Thy will
[17:29] be done on earth here just as it is in
[17:32] heaven
[17:33] so you know and finally it just one
[17:36] letter thought before we start reading
[17:37] it at Psalm 48 12 it describes Zion in
[17:40] this way walk about Zion and go round
[17:42] about her tell the towers there of
[17:44] Markey well her bulwarks consider her
[17:46] palaces many palaces many dwelling
[17:50] places many mansions in this place Jesus
[17:54] said in John 14 in my father's house are
[17:57] many mansions if it were not so I would
[18:00] have told you I go to prepare a place
[18:03] for you and if I go and prepare a place
[18:05] for you I will come again and receive
[18:08] you unto myself that where I am present
[18:11] tense there ye may be also so you know
[18:15] as I'm thinking about that in this
[18:16] invitation to come and the blessed is
[18:20] the man who in the Lord causes to come
[18:23] into this dwelling place cohabitating
[18:25] with him here and now you know how many
[18:28] times during this pestilence have we
[18:29] thought boy I wish it was some place I
[18:31] could go to just get away from it all
[18:33] well it turns out there is right there
[18:35] is a promise to the believer says I was
[18:38] glad when they said unto me let us go
[18:40] into the house of the Lord not this
[18:42] house his house so that hopefully bless
[18:46] you as it is me if you want to turn to
[18:48] Psalm 65 we'll go ahead just read this
[18:50] together says this praise wait
[18:56] for the Oh God in Zion and it's at these
[18:59] shall the vow be performed Oh thou that
[19:02] here is prayer unto thee shall all flesh
[19:05] comb iniquities prevail against me as
[19:09] for our transgressions thou shall purge
[19:12] them away blessed is the man whom thou
[19:15] chooses and causes to approach unto thee
[19:17] that he may dwell in thy courts we shall
[19:21] be satisfied with the goodness of thy
[19:23] house even of thy holy temple by
[19:26] terrible things in righteousness wilt
[19:28] thou answer us O God of our salvation
[19:31] who art the confidence of all the ends
[19:34] of the earth and of them that are afar
[19:36] off upon the sea which by his strength
[19:39] said it fast the mountains being girded
[19:42] with power which still it the noise of
[19:44] the Seas the noise of their waves and
[19:47] the tumult of the people they also that
[19:50] dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid
[19:52] of they talk ins thou make us the
[19:54] outgoings of the morning and evening to
[19:57] rejoice thou visitest the earth and
[19:59] waterís did though greatly and richest
[20:02] it with the river of god which is full
[20:05] of water

[20:08] so provided for it now water is the
[20:11] ridges thereof abundantly thou said

[45:51] you to bless those that are assembled
[45:53] here this morning father those that are
[45:59] with us by way of streaming this morning
[46:05] father
[46:06] Lord you just pray that you create an
[46:11] atmosphere around them in their heart in
[46:16] their lives that they know that you're
[46:18] with them that you'll keep them and
[46:23] protect them that you're not a God that
[46:26] dwells in Tabernacles made by hand but
[46:32] you're a God that dwells in the living
[46:34] people we just asked this morning that
[46:37] you would encourage our faith we ask
[46:40] these things in Jesus precious and
[46:43] wonderful name we pray amen amen
[46:49] god bless you you know they if you turn
[46:54] in your Bibles to Hebrews if you would
[46:57] this morning the 11th chapter and the
[47:01] first few verses which I'm sure we're
[47:03] all very familiar with you know you go
[47:08] into a restaurant and they allow you to
[47:13] walk in the restaurant with your mask
[47:16] that when you sit down at the table to
[47:19] feed you can take it off so I believe
[47:25] we're sitting at the table of the King
[47:27] this morning so we be certainly I know
[47:33] it's hard to worship and this sing
[47:36] with masks gone but I think you know
[47:42] there's just so many things types and so
[47:45] many things rolling in so many things
[47:48] today but we're just grateful to be here
[47:50] let's read these scriptures we will try
[47:52] not to be long this morning as you know
[47:55] that our event this evening we were
[47:59] going to try to have a little
[48:01] recognition celebration for brother Mike
[48:07] and Alan as they're retiring and all the
[48:10] wonderful years of service that they had
[48:13] given us but you know right as we
[48:17] announced that the governor dropped down
[48:20] another order in another order and and
[48:24] so we just felt it's best at this time
[48:27] to cancel it so I do have plenty of
[48:31] hamburger so we'll have to just pick
[48:34] another day to to do something together
[48:38] amen
[48:39] let's read this scripture here and I'm
[48:45] sure most all of us have this memorized
[48:47] at the first few verses now faith is the
[48:52] substance of things hoped for the
[48:56] evidence of things not seen for by it
[49:02] the elders obtained a good report
[49:05] through faith we understand that the
[49:09] worlds were framed by the Word of God so
[49:13] that things which are seen were not made
[49:17] of things which do appear and let's skip
[49:22] to the sixth verse it says but without
[49:26] faith it is impossible to please him for
[49:29] he that cometh to God must believe that
[49:32] he is and that he is a rewarder of them
[49:36] that diligently seek Him amen god bless
[49:40] you you may be seated
[49:43] I forgot last week to introduce or
[49:54] acknowledge I believe it's Ben is that
[49:58] right and now I heard your name the
[50:01] other day system and Olivia
[50:06] so Ben in Olivia Shelly are here
[50:08] visiting with us now
[50:11] rumor has it that you guys are fabulous
[50:14] singers and and if you know we we make
[50:23] all kinds of new customs here at this
[50:25] church you know we sing specials at the
[50:28] end of service we can sing specials
[50:31] anyone but I'm not going to be too long
[50:34] this morning so I was wondering if it
[50:39] would be possible if you would come sing
[50:44] for us we can create our own order can't
[50:49] wait right we're not we're not bound by
[50:51] traditions such as some are bound by
[50:54] traditions so okay and it might give me
[50:58] a little bit of inspiration so Olivia
[51:01] would you I know you sing I don't really
[51:04] know about him that I mean II and if you
[51:11] have anybody that wants to join you
[51:13] bring them along but if you need to all
[51:20] right what do you need yeah
[51:23] a husband you come and play you can pick
[51:26] up almost anything yeah we're just here
[51:35] to enjoy the Lord aren't ya
[51:37] all right and then microphones here we
[51:39] go make sure they're on thank you for
[51:50] being here with us we certainly welcome
[51:52] you and and
[52:21] waters the storms raging high the waters
[52:27] around them they were troubled a night
[52:33] fear filled their hearts they were died
[52:40] they fail to remember it the master
[52:47] and
[52:49] book
[52:52] [Music]
[53:43] the Bible
[53:47] [Music]
[53:49] the darkness when the way
[53:54] [Music]
[53:59] footsteps in my master
[54:08] [Music]
[54:25] my body
[54:28] [Music]
[55:04] to the store
[55:07] [Music]
[55:12] [Applause]
[55:18] why should we worry amen
[55:22] you know I've always been a little
[55:29] jealous of ministers who could preach
[55:32] and sing I never thought it was fair but
[55:36] their father's quite a minister in and
[55:39] singer himself so I just want to
[55:43] fellowship with you a little bit this
[55:46] morning I hope I think that song was
[55:49] perfect because I kind of just want to
[55:52] just speak some words of encouragement
[55:55] to us you know there's you you get the
[55:59] hearing so much out there all the time
[56:03] you know and we know that the
[56:06] conversation of the world today is the
[56:10] virus the virus you can use the virus
[56:15] for an excuse for anything you can burn
[56:19] your panic cakes and you can say it's
[56:21] the virus and everybody accepts it you
[56:25] can be late and it's with a virus you
[56:27] can you can any type of failure any type
[56:31] of reasoning you can just tack it on the
[56:36] virus and so you know I got to just
[56:39] thinking about that it just bothered me
[56:41] so much
[56:42] everybody's testing for virus and
[56:44] testing for this and you know I'm in a
[56:48] public office you might say and I
[56:51] contact a lot of people so they want to
[56:54] test me another word for that test is
[56:58] torture so you know they just want to do
[57:03] these things and I thought you know you
[57:06] know so I got to think of what is a
[57:07] virus you know I just curious so I
[57:11] looked up the different definition and
[57:14] it says it's an infective agent or micro
[57:22] body
[57:23] agent it's too small to be seen and it
[57:30] can only live and reproduce in a living
[57:33] cell so that's a virus well I got to
[57:37] thinking you know God's got a virus in
[57:41] his virus is faith and and it's it's
[57:47] it's an effective agent amen it spreads
[57:51] and it's contagious and it get a
[57:55] multiply and but it's got to be in
[57:58] something that's alive hey ma'am and you
[58:03] know canned faith is the evidence of
[58:05] things not seen it's too small to be
[58:08] seen amen but you know it's a thing and
[58:14] that's what we just want to talk about
[58:17] it a little bit it does this morning
[58:20] just to you know keep us on track you
[58:25] know one of the things that's hard for
[58:28] me is there's so many in the church that
[58:32] haven't been able to come for so long we
[58:35] have frontline workers we call them we
[58:37] have people that are in contact with
[58:44] sick people in and in other so many
[58:48] other circumstances that's around that
[58:51] we don't get to reach out and fellowship
[58:55] but yet you're on our hearts and our
[58:57] minds and and I know many of you listen
[59:00] in with the services so we want to stay
[59:04] encouraged this morning and that kind of
[59:07] what my heart's desire is is just a to
[59:12] just build up just build up our faith
[59:17] and and build up our encouragement and
[59:21] just and look into the Word of God and
[59:24] find perspective as we preached here I
[59:28] believe it was last Sunday I think we
[59:31] entitled the service I'm trying to title
[59:36] my sermon
[59:37] and it's very difficult for me so this
[59:41] one I think I'll just call it God has a
[59:43] virus amen and I don't know if the
[59:48] sermon will match the title but it
[59:51] doesn't seem to matter
[59:53] everybody else was titling my sermons
[59:57] and their titles didn't match my sermon
[1:00:00] so I don't know but I think repeats on
[1:00:05] your part
[1:00:08] yeah your part in the plan of God and
[1:00:13] that God had a plan from the beginning
[1:00:16] and in the beginning you know God within
[1:00:21] himself he was God that he was the self
[1:00:24] existing one so if we could say it in
[1:00:28] this form or fashion that God dwelt
[1:00:32] alone so if you could picture yourself
[1:00:38] living in we can't really put ourselves
[1:00:43] in God's place but we'll do just to get
[1:00:46] in there if you lived in a place all by
[1:00:48] yourself
[1:00:49] and nobody knew you they didn't know
[1:00:55] anything about you they didn't know what
[1:00:57] that you were they didn't know the kind
[1:01:00] of person you were
[1:01:02] and and all that you were was just
[1:01:07] contained within yourself and there was
[1:01:10] nothing around you or nothing going on
[1:01:15] around you to bring out any of the
[1:01:19] things that you were so you just existed
[1:01:25] by yourself and you were in that state
[1:01:30] one place the messenger of the hour
[1:01:32] referred to it as a great fountain of
[1:01:36] many colors many lights just whatever it
[1:01:41] is and we'll never be able to comprehend
[1:01:44] God I guess in our minds that we have
[1:01:49] here
[1:01:50] I believe that he'll have to place a new
[1:01:53] mind in us and I'm more than willing to
[1:01:56] leave this mind behind amen it's failed
[1:01:59] me many times and it's failing me
[1:02:02] quicker and quicker but he dwelt by
[1:02:05] himself just picture that and one day in
[1:02:10] his implement plan he says I want to
[1:02:13] have fellowship I want to I want to have
[1:02:18] fellowship with somebody
[1:02:20] so the first intentions of God was to
[1:02:23] have fellowship he wanted to reveal
[1:02:26] himself he wanted to let people know
[1:02:30] what kind of person that he was and and
[1:02:36] so we as and then we went on and we
[1:02:38] talked a little bit more about
[1:02:40] circumstances that circumstances caused
[1:02:44] things to be brought out things are
[1:02:47] manifested by circumstance so God is
[1:02:51] sitting here in this great place that he
[1:02:53] was in we will call it his house because
[1:02:57] all creation all in all is God's house
[1:03:01] he dwells in everything he's all in all
[1:03:03] so he dwell here in this place and so he
[1:03:07] decided that he would begin to reveal
[1:03:09] himself or manifest himself and show
[1:03:12] himself so he said let there be
[1:03:16] let there be let there be and in his
[1:03:20] mind he he had this great magnificent
[1:03:26] plan that he wanted to unfold and okay
[1:03:33] and the purpose that he wanted to unfold
[1:03:35] it is he wanted to reveal himself he
[1:03:38] wanted to have fellowship he wanted to
[1:03:42] have preeminence not preeminence in the
[1:03:46] way of like a mean ruler but preeminence
[1:03:50] in being the supplier and the source of
[1:03:54] light and the life of men and so God
[1:03:57] began his plan of creation he created
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:01] and he created the stars in the Sun and
[1:04:04] the moon and all those things that were
[1:04:07] created but in in those things it
[1:04:13] displayed his glory but he only had
[1:04:16] fellowship with himself in those things
[1:04:21] you know like so it'd be like if you
[1:04:24] were in this home by yourself and one
[1:04:27] day you took out your your paints and
[1:04:31] you you painted a just the most
[1:04:34] magnificent painting that was ever
[1:04:38] painted but there was nobody there to
[1:04:41] share it with and so in one way
[1:04:46] there was nobody would know that it was
[1:04:49] magnificent so you couldn't receive
[1:04:55] praise for it you you you know and God
[1:05:01] he wasn't God until he became an object
[1:05:06] of worship so then he end this great you
[1:05:12] know when I start thinking of the mind
[1:05:14] of God I'm glad I have that mind for me
[1:05:19] okay you you understand I'm glad that
[1:05:22] that mind is for me if God be for you
[1:05:25] who can be against you so just think of
[1:05:28] the great mind of God he created all
[1:05:31] this magnificence and beauty but there
[1:05:33] is nobody there to praise them for it
[1:05:35] nobody just tell them how magnificent
[1:05:37] was no money don't no one - aw so you've
[1:05:41] got this great painting in your home
[1:05:43] that you painted and and you did it and
[1:05:48] because you did it it was you but
[1:05:52] nevertheless it was couldn't be
[1:05:54] worshiped it couldn't be admired it
[1:05:56] couldn't be shared nothing would come of
[1:05:59] it
[1:06:00] so God in this great understanding of
[1:06:04] creation because he created it he formed
[1:06:07] man and he formed man in His image in
[1:06:12] other words he may
[1:06:14] man with the ability to perceive to see
[1:06:19] to understand to have emotions
[1:06:22] he created outward realms of the senses
[1:06:26] see touch taste smell hear he did those
[1:06:29] things so that they man could contact
[1:06:33] the world and then he placed the spirit
[1:06:36] in him that had that could feel and have
[1:06:40] emotions and love and so now God had
[1:06:44] something to fellowship with so God
[1:06:48] created man and he had someone to
[1:06:50] fellowship with and the man that he
[1:06:52] created was Adam and and so Adam began
[1:06:57] to walk in the cool of the evening he
[1:07:01] walked with God and he God would say
[1:07:06] he'd turned the father and said father
[1:07:08] all those drafts whatever made you give
[1:07:15] them such a long neck oh you're such a
[1:07:19] God of variety and and and he would see
[1:07:22] the son need worship him and the garden
[1:07:25] was beautiful and the father gave him
[1:07:28] power over this I want to you understand
[1:07:30] this great fellowship that he had and
[1:07:35] and and the love that they had and the
[1:07:38] fellowship they had and the faith that
[1:07:40] they had together and then yet as God
[1:07:44] walked with Adam his son Adam was the
[1:07:50] son of God a man he it wasn't a
[1:07:53] byproduct he came straight from God
[1:07:56] himself and the Spirit of God dwelt in
[1:07:59] him and as he walked with the son there
[1:08:03] was a part of him that his son couldn't
[1:08:09] know he didn't he
[1:08:15] Adam didn't know God was a healer he
[1:08:20] didn't know God was a deliverer he
[1:08:22] didn't know God what was a Savior see if
[1:08:26] this is
[1:08:27] because you've got a part in the plan of
[1:08:30] God you've got to understand that that
[1:08:34] God's got there's a part that you play
[1:08:37] that he wanted to wants to play out in
[1:08:40] you just like he played out in creation
[1:08:43] just like he played out walking with
[1:08:46] Adam and so finally Adams there and and
[1:08:50] and God's got all these attributes that
[1:08:52] he that he wants to share and there's no
[1:08:58] way that he can share that with Adam so
[1:09:02] he's going to make a byproduct he's
[1:09:06] going to take a part of Adam and and he
[1:09:11] separates Adam Adam being both male and
[1:09:13] female and he takes the feminine part
[1:09:16] out of Adam it creates out of his rib
[1:09:18] and he now he has a by-product so the
[1:09:22] Justice of God now God has a way to
[1:09:29] manifest his attributes to Adam but out
[1:09:34] and and so God being just in his mind so
[1:09:40] he creates the byproduct but God knew
[1:09:44] what was in Adam you have to understand
[1:09:48] because God created Adam so he knew that
[1:09:52] Eve would fall but he also knew that
[1:09:56] Adam possessed an attribute that he
[1:10:01] received from his father that was going
[1:10:04] to redeem what was his that he would go
[1:10:10] out with it and and so God being just he
[1:10:15] says okay I know that Adam and Eve are
[1:10:18] going to go out I know that now they're
[1:10:22] going to have offspring I know that that
[1:10:26] they're going to have two children and
[1:10:28] that life's going to go on and in order
[1:10:31] to be just and fair to Adam and to Eve
[1:10:36] I'm going to put their name in the
[1:10:39] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:10:41] the foundation of the world nothing will
[1:10:44] ever take it off nothing can ever put it
[1:10:50] on there it is my choosing I choose it
[1:10:54] I'm the creator of heaven and earth and
[1:10:57] I make one vessel unto honor and another
[1:11:00] vessel under dishonour and I know who's
[1:11:03] mine I know who I'm spoken of and their
[1:11:06] names are put in this Lamb's Book of
[1:11:09] Life before the foundation of the
[1:11:11] beginning of the world nate'll I can let
[1:11:14] them go because they're eternally secure
[1:11:17] in me Oh hallelujah hallelujah we're
[1:11:26] trying to get to something this morning
[1:11:28] that that that fact actually resonates
[1:11:37] in us at the end so he sets forth this
[1:11:43] lambs up he puts their name in the
[1:11:46] Lamb's Book of Life and now he allows
[1:11:49] man to go out and into the world and so
[1:11:59] to speak now man's in contact with these
[1:12:02] feelings he's in contact with his
[1:12:05] emotions and he's in contact with great
[1:12:10] things and and so man starts on his
[1:12:15] journey and so we we see then that what
[1:12:19] we've been what we've been talking about
[1:12:22] and kind of bringing about on these
[1:12:26] lines is that I just had a paper here
[1:12:31] and then it disappeared on me oh well
[1:12:34] maybe I took it here and turned it into
[1:12:36] the book of life which is something that
[1:12:41] I could have very simply alright you
[1:12:45] don't miss I'm not totally senile yet so
[1:12:48] don't vote me out right away give me up
[1:12:51] no that ain't yet
[1:12:52] oh well
[1:12:54] I'll just have to go on yeah I wonder
[1:13:02] how this looks on the Internet all
[1:13:05] righty
[1:13:06] so so we so we we see that this great
[1:13:14] plan of God so that's what we're talking
[1:13:18] about we're talking our part that we
[1:13:21] play in the plan of God so God unfolded
[1:13:26] this plan and part of this plan was to
[1:13:29] manifest the other attributes that he
[1:13:32] had in him now brem specifically brings
[1:13:37] that revelation out because it's part of
[1:13:41] the the message that he was trying to
[1:13:45] deliver to us that man could never
[1:13:47] understand they couldn't understand how
[1:13:51] did I get myself into this place that
[1:13:55] I'm born in sin shaped and iniquity come
[1:13:58] into the world speaking lives I didn't
[1:14:01] have a choice over that I inherited that
[1:14:06] that because of sin and and my father
[1:14:12] was sin then my husband was sin so I was
[1:14:16] married to the nature that I picked up
[1:14:19] in the flag you know when when Mama
[1:14:26] asked me did you take the cookies out of
[1:14:28] the jar with a cookie in my hand
[1:14:33] chocolate chip all over my face no can
[1:14:43] you say why why would I lie it was an
[1:14:47] instinct and an attribute of the nature
[1:14:52] of sin I was born in sin shaped in
[1:14:57] iniquity shaped in unbelief and I came
[1:15:00] into the world speaking live so we were
[1:15:05] all born good
[1:15:07] fires but there's never a good lie
[1:15:13] you know what finds out a lie don't you
[1:15:16] the truth that's why the truth sets you
[1:15:21] free from the lie the lie that Satan's
[1:15:27] been telling us the life that he's been
[1:15:30] pointing us to the bondage he's trying
[1:15:34] to keep us under by the law but God's
[1:15:38] plan he had this great wonderful plan he
[1:15:42] wanted to unfold a part of that great
[1:15:45] plan he wanted to done full was he
[1:15:47] wanted to redeem back all those that
[1:15:52] were his they had eternal life because
[1:15:59] if you've had eternal life you always
[1:16:02] have had eternal life because there's
[1:16:05] only one thing that's eternal and that's
[1:16:08] God so you had to come from God you had
[1:16:12] to be with him in the beginning you had
[1:16:15] to be in his thinking from the beginning
[1:16:18] all that the father hath given me will
[1:16:21] come my sheep hear my voice in another
[1:16:24] they will not follow so he knew that
[1:16:30] that there that that plan was there that
[1:16:34] great eternal life was there so his plan
[1:16:38] that was to redeem another were they
[1:16:43] were his but they were now out of their
[1:16:47] original purpose which was fellowship
[1:16:50] they were out of their original place
[1:16:54] which was to glorify Him for God seeks
[1:16:57] the man to worship Him in spirit and in
[1:17:00] truth and seek such - were that young
[1:17:03] man was out of his created place so God
[1:17:07] wanted to redeem him or bring him back
[1:17:11] to the place that he was
[1:17:15] another reason that God placed this
[1:17:22] great plan into operation was through
[1:17:28] redemption he was able to manifest his
[1:17:32] attribute of love which he was why do
[1:17:40] you think Adam walked out of the garden
[1:17:42] with Eve because he loved her might come
[1:17:50] strange sound but he loved her he loved
[1:17:56] her so much great he was willing to lay
[1:18:00] his life down for he tried to hide her
[1:18:08] sin and he went out with her and then
[1:18:12] God's plan all the way from the
[1:18:14] beginning he had a plan for the
[1:18:16] beginning so he allowed Adam to fall so
[1:18:19] he could manifest attributes that Adam
[1:18:22] would have never known he secured him by
[1:18:24] writing his name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:18:27] Life because they always had eternal
[1:18:29] life that was the reason that Jesus
[1:18:32] could go raise up that child from the
[1:18:35] dead that'd be dead because he knew her
[1:18:38] name was in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:18:42] think of it Amen well we were yet
[1:18:46] sinners he died for us so he paid this
[1:18:50] great price of redemption and it was the
[1:18:57] man if as a no greater love HEPA man
[1:19:00] than to lay down his life for his own I
[1:19:02] lay down my life for my sheep that were
[1:19:07] I am they may be also a way to this
[1:19:10] great beautiful love story of him
[1:19:14] knowing us he knew we were out here we
[1:19:20] are a part of him he knew he was there
[1:19:27] he knew your name the color of your eyes
[1:19:30] the color of your hair the color of your
[1:19:32] skin what parents you had come through
[1:19:35] all those things he put those things
[1:19:37] together your great-great-grandfather he
[1:19:40] put them together the father all the way
[1:19:42] down he mixed and put things together
[1:19:44] until he got you hell yeah
[1:19:51] you're not a mistake you know what God
[1:19:57] ain't like AMERICA AMERICA like skinny
[1:20:02] you know they like all these carnal
[1:20:04] things God loves the inside God loves
[1:20:07] the spirit he's a he's a wonderful God
[1:20:14] nothing is happening here that he
[1:20:18] doesn't know about
[1:20:20] it's a beautiful plan so this great plan
[1:20:23] of redemption that he paid the price
[1:20:27] and now his purpose was that once that
[1:20:30] price was paid that he could once again
[1:20:34] dwell in his people and that what we
[1:20:41] came to last week that ye are the Temple
[1:20:44] of the Living God that God's part of the
[1:20:51] plan of God was to have a people that he
[1:20:56] could live in a place that he could
[1:20:59] dwell so he wouldn't be the great unseen
[1:21:03] God he would now be a God seen veiled in
[1:21:08] flesh
[1:21:09] that mystery of this last day of God
[1:21:15] being veiled and dwelling in flesh God
[1:21:19] revealed that to us through the first
[1:21:22] sheaf offering that came out that there
[1:21:25] was a man of the age that rose up that
[1:21:29] God dwelt in and there was God veiled in
[1:21:36] flesh was God people didn't understand
[1:21:44] it because they couldn't we'll move to
[1:21:49] that in a little bit but it was a
[1:21:55] manifestation of the plan of God God
[1:22:01] planned the seven Church ages he planned
[1:22:05] the messengers he planned the believer
[1:22:09] in each age he planned what word would
[1:22:13] be let out in each age because God's a
[1:22:16] nun folder
[1:22:17] he's an evolutionist and he eat he
[1:22:22] unfolds himself he brings enlightenment
[1:22:24] he brings understanding God has
[1:22:28] fellowship through revelation if you're
[1:22:33] not getting revelation and God's not
[1:22:38] enlightening your heart you're not in
[1:22:40] fellowship with him you might be in spoo
[1:22:45] it's like the mechanic he went to school
[1:22:50] he read the book he knew all about it
[1:22:54] but one day it was time to change the
[1:22:57] oil so he went in there and he got down
[1:23:00] in his back and he reached up at that
[1:23:02] plug and he said shall did they meant
[1:23:04] they did turn this plug so he turned
[1:23:07] that plug got baptized
[1:23:09] ah he was out of school he got a
[1:23:16] revelation and then he reached up to
[1:23:19] change the oil filter and he burned his
[1:23:21] hand on the manifold whoa yeah now he
[1:23:24] got a revelation you see if I maybe
[1:23:28] that's not a good example but you
[1:23:30] understand what I'm saying is that you
[1:23:35] got to be in fellowship with God
[1:23:37] revelation is God making his word a
[1:23:41] reality to you it's good fellowship that
[1:23:47] you have with him so God's plan was to
[1:23:53] dwell in a people to manifest himself in
[1:23:59] flesh he did it in shadows and types in
[1:24:03] the Old Testament through the prophets
[1:24:06] and then that all those shadows
[1:24:10] manifested itself in the beam of Jesus
[1:24:15] Christ who was the second Adam now this
[1:24:20] Adam was a quickening spirit another
[1:24:25] words a quickening spirit means to make
[1:24:27] alive
[1:24:28] so this Adam was going to go forth and
[1:24:31] make Eve alive because there was the
[1:24:35] second part of redemption that was the
[1:24:41] restore Eve back to fellowship with him
[1:24:46] and then they become one so he restored
[1:24:52] him back there were restored back at the
[1:24:57] day of Pentecost they were back in
[1:25:01] fellowship silver and gold have I none
[1:25:06] but that which I have Oh hallelujah
[1:25:10] I give to you but jesus knew the law of
[1:25:16] God he knew the plan of God because
[1:25:20] everything about God is unfold
[1:25:24] unfolding he hacked
[1:25:28] he kept here was this the the restored
[1:25:32] seed back in our fathers but you would
[1:25:39] have never had the fellowship if you
[1:25:42] would have came into that restored seed
[1:25:45] from the beginning you understand that
[1:25:50] if you had been born got the Holy Ghost
[1:25:53] you too never sinned so now he said
[1:25:59] unless this seed fall in the ground it
[1:26:06] shall not bear forth fruit so he knew
[1:26:12] what those father's had but he knew it
[1:26:16] was going to go into the ground it was
[1:26:19] part of the Word of God
[1:26:21] so if God's plan was to dwell in you and
[1:26:26] we've come to this place that you are
[1:26:29] the temple of God if you are the temple
[1:26:32] of God you have faith faith governs your
[1:26:41] life you know and so when we look at
[1:26:47] faith and we're just trying to help
[1:26:52] build us up a little bit encourage us
[1:26:54] this morning in the light of all things
[1:26:57] that are transpiring when you have faith
[1:27:01] you've got to understand that God
[1:27:03] created the world by faith less than
[1:27:10] that amazing I'm going to read just a
[1:27:14] section out of the message called faith
[1:27:18] is the substance this day that we're
[1:27:23] living in is such a day of unsettled
[1:27:27] peace and unsettled rest everywhere
[1:27:32] anybody agree with that
[1:27:35] and see it's unsettled now connects the
[1:27:39] part when my friend Tom weathers came he
[1:27:43] gave me a bell and he said he said why
[1:27:48] do you think that they put bells on the
[1:27:53] sheep well of course I have my genius
[1:27:58] answer to know where they're at
[1:28:02] all right that's great one then he began
[1:28:06] to explain to me he said you hear this
[1:28:09] ding ding ding ding
[1:28:13] he said when his sheep eats it bhau's
[1:28:16] its head and when it comes up it dings
[1:28:21] so as long as that shepherd could sit
[1:28:24] there and he'd hear that quiet ding then
[1:28:29] he would know that everything was not at
[1:28:38] peace that Bell had a pattern and then
[1:28:44] if the Sheep got Restless they would
[1:28:48] start shifting back and forth and that
[1:28:51] Bell Agoda meeting dignity gain it would
[1:28:54] create a new sound because the sheep
[1:28:57] were getting nervous something was
[1:29:00] happening and they begin to make a new
[1:29:03] sound and then as he went on to explain
[1:29:06] - he says then he said when this starts
[1:29:08] going he says you know those sheep are
[1:29:10] running from something
[1:29:13] soap how many thought of the message the
[1:29:17] uncertain sound
[1:29:21] you see it soaked it if it's a time and
[1:29:26] that's what we don't want we don't want
[1:29:29] the Sheep to be unsettled we don't want
[1:29:35] them to be disturbed
[1:29:37] okay pencil you sense that there's a
[1:29:41] disturbance coming in people are
[1:29:44] beginning to get nervous they're
[1:29:47] beginning to start wondering okay I'm
[1:29:52] starting to worry about their futures
[1:29:54] worried about this worried only brings
[1:29:57] sickness so that you know and so we want
[1:30:03] to just speak you maybe just give us
[1:30:08] something to hold to that we can no we
[1:30:11] don't have to run and start panicking
[1:30:17] people are starting to look for jobs in
[1:30:19] other places people are starting to
[1:30:22] think about I've got to show this I've
[1:30:24] got to sell this and what am I going to
[1:30:26] do and and you know there's you know
[1:30:31] afraid of one another
[1:30:35] and I you know there's so much things
[1:30:40] that don't make sense but this is this
[1:30:44] is what we're living in we're living in
[1:30:47] a time a day of unsettled peace and
[1:30:51] unsettled rest everywhere people are
[1:30:56] running to and fro seeking whatever they
[1:31:00] may seek now take these words to heart
[1:31:08] because there's only one way you can
[1:31:10] judge yourself is by the Word of God you
[1:31:15] understand so when you hear something
[1:31:17] don't just try to figure out what
[1:31:20] brother Branham was trying to say let it
[1:31:23] say something to you here
[1:31:26] ahem ask yourself if I got to the place
[1:31:31] where I'm running to and fro seeking
[1:31:35] something seeking what they may see most
[1:31:43] any man most anybody can get a following
[1:31:49] no matter what they teach or think
[1:31:53] somebody will listen to them now isn't
[1:31:59] this the time of voices you were in the
[1:32:03] worst time in this country right now is
[1:32:07] everybody's putting this bin everybody's
[1:32:10] trying to get a voice everybody's trying
[1:32:12] to be heard may if you don't shut your
[1:32:17] brain off from that garbage can you will
[1:32:21] have a garbage disposal going on in your
[1:32:24] mind
[1:32:24] your mind will be rumbling wait till
[1:32:28] after the election then it's just
[1:32:30] finger-pointing he says but no matter
[1:32:37] what they teach or think somebody will
[1:32:40] listen to them and it's a day that the
[1:32:44] prophets spoke up people when they're
[1:32:49] hungry
[1:32:49] they'll eat from anywhere if if children
[1:32:55] and people are starving they'll eat from
[1:32:58] a garbage can that once eat from an ice
[1:33:02] table
[1:33:03] so let's don't run by these things we
[1:33:06] only have one service today we hear that
[1:33:09] but if we got to see once we lived in
[1:33:12] peace once we were prospering we had
[1:33:18] jobs we were sitting at a nice table now
[1:33:24] I don't think we've got to go back to no
[1:33:26] garbage can of Satan starting to feed on
[1:33:29] fear and doubt and suspicion and judging
[1:33:34] one another confusion and
[1:33:37] break the pattern of peace that rests in
[1:33:41] our heart from God when they eat from
[1:33:46] one from a nice table but if they are
[1:33:49] hungry
[1:33:50] they'll eat somewhere so I think real
[1:33:53] true ministers of the gospel ought to be
[1:33:56] up and going and ought to be giving the
[1:34:00] people the right things meat in due
[1:34:03] season brother McGarry how can you know
[1:34:09] that you can give us meat in due season
[1:34:12] hallelujah I've got a storehouse I got I
[1:34:16] got food that's been storing up for the
[1:34:19] due season I've got a place that I can
[1:34:22] go not only me but you also you don't
[1:34:28] have to eat garbage there's been food
[1:34:31] stored up for you Jehovah Jireh I will
[1:34:35] provide a Santa Lord
[1:34:41] now this subject of mine as I have
[1:34:45] testified to you that I am NOT a
[1:34:48] preacher I'm just merely have the gift
[1:34:53] of divine healing which I humbly say it
[1:34:57] comes from God I had nothing to do with
[1:35:06] it coming I was it was for ordained of
[1:35:15] God years and years ago I had nothing to
[1:35:22] do with it
[1:35:24] let that set in because there's
[1:35:29] something you didn't have nothing to do
[1:35:31] with either
[1:35:38] this is the keynote of the Scriptures
[1:35:43] faith he that cometh to God must believe
[1:35:49] that he is and a rewarder of those who
[1:35:53] diligently seek Him without faith it's
[1:35:57] impossible to please God let's go all
[1:36:02] the way back to what we're saying God
[1:36:03] has a plan
[1:36:05] so without faith it's impossible to
[1:36:08] please go God then brother Branham says
[1:36:11] I got this gift I had nothing to do with
[1:36:16] this
[1:36:17] it was foreordained to me a long long
[1:36:23] time ago this world was made by faith
[1:36:34] what things were shaped in existence by
[1:36:43] faith God just seen that dew drop
[1:36:47] hanging out there in the air that
[1:36:51] whatever you want to call it and he just
[1:36:55] spake and said let there be light and
[1:36:59] there was light and then he brought the
[1:37:05] land forth
[1:37:06] and dried it off and so forth that all
[1:37:11] was done by an act of faith with God the
[1:37:17] whole world was made by faith now if the
[1:37:27] whole world was made by faith when God
[1:37:31] created you faith was created in you
[1:37:39] faith isn't something you muster up
[1:37:43] faith isn't something you work yourself
[1:37:46] into faith was created in you
[1:37:50] before the foundation of the world and
[1:37:54] faith was in you we call it sometimes
[1:37:59] seed faith but it was created in you
[1:38:04] faith was in you the whole world was
[1:38:08] created so if God dwells in you then
[1:38:12] faith has to be in you it was a it was a
[1:38:19] substance faith is a substance faith is
[1:38:26] something that God created in you you
[1:38:32] got to get the noodle out of faith I had
[1:38:40] the brother Bramson I had to get the
[1:38:41] divine healing I had nothing to do with
[1:38:44] it sure it had a purpose it had a reason
[1:38:54] it had poles he had a reason it was
[1:38:59] doing what it was doing you know when I
[1:39:04] first was a Christian I hadn't heard the
[1:39:09] message yet I was enamored by
[1:39:13] discernment man I discerned and one day
[1:39:21] I heard someone say if you're not 100
[1:39:23] percent right you don't mess with it and
[1:39:26] then I really saw at work and I didn't
[1:39:30] call it the gift of discernment anymore
[1:39:32] I called it the gift of stabbing I'd
[1:39:36] stab at things I had sense things I was
[1:39:38] relying on the census I was relying on
[1:39:41] what I felt I was reading feedback I
[1:39:44] have Kivus do you know my testimony I
[1:39:46] was into those realms but one day the
[1:39:50] truth came and the truth set me free
[1:39:54] how did that truth set me free because
[1:39:57] there was something a substance that God
[1:40:01] had created in there you
[1:40:04] GoGet faith you've got faith it's
[1:40:09] created in you he created it he put it
[1:40:14] there it's a substance it's something
[1:40:17] you have you've been infected by God's
[1:40:21] virus then he put the faith there my
[1:40:33] sheep know my voice how do they do that
[1:40:37] somebody tell me how they do that who do
[1:40:43] you say that I am that was the Christ
[1:40:46] the Son of the Living God Peter no man
[1:40:50] gave you that my father which was in
[1:40:53] heaven created that in you Peter had the
[1:40:58] substance you don't think he had the
[1:41:02] substance he says hey I've got the
[1:41:05] substance I don't got silver I don't got
[1:41:09] gold but I've got something in me that
[1:41:12] God gave me you know that's what we're
[1:41:18] talking about we're talking about being
[1:41:20] settled down we're talking about
[1:41:26] understanding that God created this
[1:41:30] faith in you it was created in you and
[1:41:33] when you heard the word it rose up in
[1:41:37] you when you heard the word by faith
[1:41:44] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:41:48] Word of God don't miss that just like he
[1:41:52] said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[1:41:56] pleased to dwell faith that's in here
[1:42:03] cometh when it hears the word of God
[1:42:07] it's resurrected it's brought to life it
[1:42:13] had to have a circumstance in order for
[1:42:17] it to manifest itself it had to have a
[1:42:19] word call it why did you all respond to
[1:42:29] the Eagle scream do you think you did it
[1:42:36] on your intelligence I'll tell you
[1:42:39] everybody that's done it on their
[1:42:41] intelligence is falling away because
[1:42:47] they don't have a substance they don't
[1:42:50] have something that God created in them
[1:42:54] a substance and so in this day that
[1:43:04] we're living in God promised to restore
[1:43:10] the substance see we think of the faith
[1:43:19] but we don't understand the substance
[1:43:23] where does the substance come from where
[1:43:29] does everything come from everything
[1:43:33] that is all things that were created
[1:43:36] every bit of it was created by God the
[1:43:39] plan of God was created by God and
[1:43:42] you're part of the plan of God was that
[1:43:46] he could dwell in you and if he dwells
[1:43:48] in you you've got faith in you I didn't
[1:43:55] have anything to do with it it was
[1:44:00] decided a long long time ago now Satan
[1:44:09] gave a lot of you a big old struggle in
[1:44:13] and out up and down trying this trying
[1:44:16] that all kinds of stuff but something
[1:44:19] was there
[1:44:22] it's a substance it's created in you
[1:44:26] faith is not something that's worked up
[1:44:30] you can go on and read in this message
[1:44:33] he said people come in the prayer line
[1:44:35] and they say I've got faith I believe
[1:44:38] I've got pay pieces they don't have
[1:44:40] anything no faith at all they don't
[1:44:44] realize they've got faith they're trying
[1:44:47] to create an atmosphere or an attitude
[1:44:54] they're trying to create a feeling
[1:44:57] they're trying to create something that
[1:44:59] they can hold on to but real faith is a
[1:45:03] gift of God lest any man should both if
[1:45:07] just a substance is something that's in
[1:45:10] you it's something that God placed in
[1:45:12] you you don't know why there's no
[1:45:16] logical explanation on earth why I'm
[1:45:20] standing behind this pulpit this morning
[1:45:22] I'm uneducated
[1:45:24] I've got complexes I've got fears I feel
[1:45:28] I'm afraid I can't communicate but I
[1:45:32] can't help what's in my heart and the
[1:45:36] substance that's in there once I got
[1:45:42] converted I love people I hated people
[1:45:50] I would have hated you without a cause
[1:45:55] all's people did was hurt me make fun of
[1:45:59] me I had such terrible insecure complex
[1:46:03] and inferiority complex that everybody
[1:46:06] just brought the worst out in me but one
[1:46:09] day somebody let me know by the Word of
[1:46:15] God that were there was something in me
[1:46:17] it was always there it was created in me
[1:46:22] and if I had eternal life and always had
[1:46:27] eternal life then I always had faith
[1:46:30] [Music]
[1:46:31] [Applause]
[1:46:34] faith is the evidence I hope for heaven
[1:46:43] now where's the evidence of heaven of
[1:46:48] things not seen the evidence is what he
[1:46:51] created in me
[1:46:53] it's what's in me he created it he put
[1:46:58] there and that's what he was going to do
[1:47:02] so Quinn went wonderful though when
[1:47:07] faith cometh by hearing the word of God
[1:47:12] it didn't say faith was created by
[1:47:16] hearing the word of God or faith was
[1:47:18] given by hearing the Word of God faith
[1:47:21] was resurrected and brought to life it
[1:47:25] cometh to meet the word
[1:47:31] when you heard the word the faith was in
[1:47:34] you but what was he he was a quickening
[1:47:39] spirit he was one that came to make
[1:47:44] alive make alive what do you think God's
[1:47:47] trying to make alive in you the
[1:47:49] intellect of doctrine and message and
[1:47:53] everything he's trying to restoring you
[1:47:57] what he created in you from the
[1:48:00] foundation of the beginning of the world
[1:48:03] the just live my faith now can you
[1:48:15] imagine you doubting the very thing that
[1:48:19] God put in you because of a fleshly body
[1:48:28] when the very thing that's going to
[1:48:31] overcome he that is in you is greater
[1:48:35] than he that is in the world what he put
[1:48:41] in you before the foundation of the
[1:48:45] world is greater then what's in the
[1:48:51] world let's just follow the plan of God
[1:48:57] for a few moments I'm being like that
[1:49:03] all the ministers who don't have Sunday
[1:49:05] evening service I'm gonna make you enjoy
[1:49:08] your afternoon you can take a nap you
[1:49:15] can go play Rip Van Winkle but just
[1:49:19] listen this morning
[1:49:24] so he sent a message to restore right he
[1:49:33] knew it was going to go into the ground
[1:49:34] so he wanted it restored so he promised
[1:49:41] he would restore the substance of God
[1:49:45] being in you that's what the messenger
[1:49:51] came to restore back to the believer was
[1:49:56] the substance of God being in you
[1:50:01] everybody taught you repent and then you
[1:50:07] get God no he said it was a lamb to
[1:50:14] begin with he said you can take the pig
[1:50:19] and you can wash it up and you can clean
[1:50:22] it up and you can see the like hey but
[1:50:24] it's a what it's a pig because it has
[1:50:28] the what the nature of a pig and if you
[1:50:35] have faith you have the nature of the
[1:50:40] creator because faith created the world
[1:50:44] and if faith created you then faith is
[1:50:50] in you he created it there that's what
[1:50:57] he's trying to restore he wasn't trying
[1:50:59] to bring a new faith he wasn't trying to
[1:51:02] give us keys to stir faith up there was
[1:51:06] a faith that laid in the divine neglect
[1:51:11] of God
[1:51:12] and he came to restore what was already
[1:51:17] in down and bring it to life by giving
[1:51:21] him the true Word of God why it had to
[1:51:27] be a message with the true Word of God
[1:51:34] because and that's what the messenger
[1:51:39] says he says their gospel cannot meet
[1:51:42] the challenge of the age it had to be a
[1:51:47] faith of substance
[1:51:50] now the substance is in you so what did
[1:51:55] the message come to do didn't come to
[1:51:59] bring it to you it came to show you it
[1:52:05] was there because it was veiled to you
[1:52:15] then if you've read the message
[1:52:17] unveiling of God he said it was veiled
[1:52:19] when God came in flesh everything that
[1:52:23] the Word of God they couldn't see it
[1:52:24] because of their traditions so what if
[1:52:27] Satan do Satan's sealed the possession
[1:52:34] of the substance away from the people
[1:52:42] Satan steals it away do you know that it
[1:52:49] was there he sealed it away by coming in
[1:52:53] a white horse rider he sealed it away by
[1:52:59] coming in a red horse rider how did he
[1:53:02] do it he sealed it with intellect he
[1:53:06] sealed it with false teaching he did two
[1:53:11] things that touched the mind but not the
[1:53:14] heart he sealed it away making is
[1:53:21] totally unaware all of a sudden pudding
[1:53:26] is he
[1:53:26] the struggle looking outwardly for
[1:53:32] something that was inside I don't know
[1:53:38] I've looked for the glasses on my head
[1:53:40] that had on my head
[1:53:43] you start looking for something that you
[1:53:45] possess you talk about loss you talk
[1:53:52] about wandering you're looking for
[1:53:55] something that you've had all the time
[1:53:59] so what is the word do what was the
[1:54:07] message to do was to restore back to the
[1:54:12] bride back to Eve that she possessed it
[1:54:17] she hasn't but have been hidden from her
[1:54:24] by her false husband of nature the false
[1:54:35] husband of human nature by the the
[1:54:39] attributes that were taught to you by
[1:54:42] the things that you grew up under all
[1:54:45] those things have influenced you and
[1:54:47] built a personality around you and made
[1:54:51] you that way you are and to think you go
[1:54:54] all that's a blind lie from the pits of
[1:54:57] hell if you had eternal life you've
[1:55:01] always had eternal life your names in
[1:55:07] the books the trouble with us is is we
[1:55:09] don't come in contact with the very
[1:55:12] thing that's in us he says praying to
[1:55:16] him who is within you God worked from
[1:55:20] the inside out why does he work from the
[1:55:23] inside out because he has to work from
[1:55:26] the substance of his creation
[1:55:29] [Music]
[1:55:34] what he's trying to do he's trying to
[1:55:42] bring it so God sent a message by a
[1:55:47] prophetic gift a prophet to break those
[1:55:53] seals the seals that Satan put on the
[1:56:02] church and the Prophet comes on the
[1:56:06] scene he says that white horse was a
[1:56:07] lying spirit from the devil and this is
[1:56:11] what it did for the church that red
[1:56:15] horse was a lying spirit from the devil
[1:56:18] and this is what it did to the church
[1:56:20] that black horse was a lying spirit from
[1:56:23] the devil political and everything bound
[1:56:25] together that pale horse is a lying
[1:56:27] spirit and he broke he broke the seals
[1:56:34] he broke the veil and let us look past
[1:56:39] the deception past the fear to restore
[1:56:45] back the substance our fathers possessed
[1:56:55] as without faith it's impossible to
[1:57:00] please God do you understand you have a
[1:57:04] virus you have an infectious agent too
[1:57:13] small to be seen that can only live in
[1:57:17] and reproduce in a living cell house
[1:57:26] faith transmitted
[1:57:28] [Music]
[1:57:31] from faith to faith from faith from
[1:57:37] substance to substance from seed to see
[1:57:49] you can't give I missed it
[1:57:54] I mean you just can't give it unless
[1:58:00] it's there it's a virus it infects the
[1:58:06] substance transfers
[1:58:14] it's got symptoms praise God this virus
[1:58:18] is not asymptomatic and then you don't
[1:58:23] have it and not have a show you have it
[1:58:26] it shows works is fie hrus expressed it
[1:58:39] works
[1:58:39] no asymptomatic well I'm asymptomatic
[1:58:45] I've got faith it don't show when you've
[1:58:53] got that substance and you realize that
[1:58:56] don't you see the message was trying to
[1:59:00] get us to realize that we were in him
[1:59:04] before the foundation of the beginning
[1:59:07] of the world that we were a part of him
[1:59:09] that we were that part that went out now
[1:59:16] he's bringing that part back to life wet
[1:59:20] shirt I can't understand why the world
[1:59:25] won't receive this message it's the most
[1:59:30] glorious revelation
[1:59:33] - the living bride that there ever was
[1:59:36] it don't need no help
[1:59:42] it's designed to contact substance it's
[1:59:49] designed to live in the living cell of
[1:59:53] faith that God created in you I can see
[2:00:00] the minds that look back on sin praise
[2:00:07] God for the blood you know you try to
[2:00:16] warn people live good live clean because
[2:00:21] there comes a time even in relationship
[2:00:24] here's young people there comes a time
[2:00:26] that if you get to a certain place in
[2:00:28] your life you're gonna have to confess
[2:00:29] your past you're gonna have to have
[2:00:31] everything clean everything open then
[2:00:35] you'll know there's a blood believe me
[2:00:45] the brace of God goes to both sides the
[2:00:51] love of God can set in just put that
[2:00:55] there but you see if God created
[2:00:58] something in you you're not walking
[2:01:01] around here like a zombie and one day
[2:01:05] God came and gave you life you were
[2:01:10] walking around like a zombie because you
[2:01:13] didn't know the life was there then then
[2:01:19] the word we use the word at like
[2:01:23] impregnating or bringing to life or
[2:01:26] causing to grow and it started to grow
[2:01:30] in you and so now we understand without
[2:01:35] that substance being in you there's no
[2:01:39] way you can please God
[2:01:46] so man's great big effort is to please
[2:01:48] themselves let's build a bigger this
[2:01:52] let's build a system let's build an
[2:01:54] organization that's not what pleases God
[2:01:57] what pleases God is when you come to the
[2:02:00] realization and the resting place that
[2:02:04] I've got something in me that's created
[2:02:07] by God and I'll close on this you know
[2:02:17] they talk about a new normal
[2:02:21] and I thought you know something I was
[2:02:25] going to say not a new normal and I
[2:02:27] scratched that word not out I said a new
[2:02:31] normal live by the word of faith that's
[2:02:36] our new normal
[2:02:39] that's what all this circumstance is
[2:02:42] bringing us to that's why the world is
[2:02:44] falling apart around us that's why
[2:02:46] there's so much nonsense and confusion
[2:02:49] and turmoil to get us back to living by
[2:02:53] the substance
[2:02:55] what are you having confidence in I'm
[2:03:00] having confidence and I rest in this one
[2:03:06] thing and one thing alone that which was
[2:03:10] in me came from above give me a reason I
[2:03:20] don't have one he created one vessel
[2:03:25] unto honor and one to dishonor the
[2:03:29] choosing is his own all mankind lied
[2:03:34] before him like a lump of clay with
[2:03:38] nail-scarred hands he crafts every
[2:03:40] vessel after his own choosing to perform
[2:03:45] the work that he'd have it to do and
[2:03:47] sometimes he takes that vessel and
[2:03:49] completely tears it down that he might
[2:03:52] rebuild it again I know that true
[2:04:00] I've been tore down too many times but
[2:04:05] what's one thing I know he's the Potter
[2:04:07] and I'm the clay and he made that he
[2:04:14] created in there so I I just think that
[2:04:20] that in this hour that we lived in and
[2:04:25] and there this virus is causing to be so
[2:04:28] crazy but we begin to understand that
[2:04:33] this the virus of God faith it's hid
[2:04:40] from the world they don't see it in you
[2:04:45] they just see another man they just see
[2:04:48] another woman they just see a brother a
[2:04:50] sister a person there's no way that they
[2:04:53] can see it's failed but inside of you it
[2:05:00] begins to manifest itself because you've
[2:05:04] been invited I hope I can express this
[2:05:10] to you right the very flesh substance of
[2:05:14] faith that's in you has been veiled to
[2:05:17] you by your own flesh by your own flesh
[2:05:29] by your own senses but that's why when
[2:05:35] the word of God comes
[2:05:37] it strikes something that's in there a
[2:05:41] substance that's in there so you're
[2:05:44] invited to come out from behind the veil
[2:05:50] of your flesh and enter into that inner
[2:05:55] veil to enter into him
[2:06:02] he wants to tear that veil of the flesh
[2:06:08] that's why that went Satan's for horse
[2:06:12] rider religion appealed to it appealed
[2:06:16] to the mind it appealed to the flesh and
[2:06:18] made us give us something that we
[2:06:21] thought we could do some sort of
[2:06:23] standard to live by but let me tell you
[2:06:25] something when that substance comes to
[2:06:27] life then you live by the substance
[2:06:30] that's in you
[2:06:34] so he's inviting us to step past the
[2:06:39] veil of your flesh what you're watching
[2:06:44] what you're listening how that you feel
[2:06:51] all the aggravation that build up in you
[2:06:55] and their frustration he's inviting us
[2:06:58] past those things we in him than we
[2:07:09] being in him we are still veiled to the
[2:07:13] religious and professors of this world
[2:07:18] we're veiled to them they don't see what
[2:07:22] we're talking about they don't see the
[2:07:25] message they don't see we've been
[2:07:27] created to believe this see our glory
[2:07:33] that we have and enjoy
[2:07:36] we are still veiled to them Outsiders
[2:07:40] they think we're crazy a nut again
[2:07:44] that's right but we who are in here in
[2:07:50] Christ baptized unto Him first
[2:07:55] Corinthians 12 into him we are partakers
[2:07:59] of his glory see but not on the outside
[2:08:05] you're still looking in denying it so so
[2:08:13] we are invite
[2:08:15] in to him now look what he just said
[2:08:20] you're on the outside and you're denying
[2:08:25] what's in you you just can't hardly
[2:08:31] believe that God created faith in you
[2:08:35] before the foundation of the world and
[2:08:38] he chose to wrap that faith whatever
[2:08:42] wrapper you happen to be like a Snickers
[2:08:49] bar
[2:08:51] this substance got the David McGarry
[2:08:54] wrapper yeah not that kind of wrapper
[2:09:04] you got your wrapper all of you but if
[2:09:11] you stand on the outside you're looking
[2:09:14] and denying what's on the inside that's
[2:09:18] what he's trying to do he's trying to
[2:09:20] say I've put faith in there don't look
[2:09:25] at the wrapper don't be on the outside
[2:09:28] denying it walk into it he says in
[2:09:37] Corinthians into him we are partakers of
[2:09:40] his glory but not on the outside you're
[2:09:45] still looking in denying it see if you
[2:09:50] don't you don't want to be on the
[2:09:52] outside you don't want to be battling
[2:09:54] with it if the world was created by
[2:09:58] faith and God created you he created the
[2:10:01] faith oh I just wished that I had words
[2:10:05] in my vocabulary too unless the church
[2:10:08] understand that he's made this we're
[2:10:14] sitting right in the right spot at the
[2:10:17] right time in the right bound bodies at
[2:10:20] the right place in the right
[2:10:22] circumstance and right everything
[2:10:24] everything's perfect
[2:10:29] and he gave us the only thing that we
[2:10:34] need to make it and that's the substance
[2:10:38] of faith that he created in us we didn't
[2:10:45] earn it he created it let's close with
[2:10:47] this so now we are invited into him to
[2:10:52] be partakers of all that he is we are
[2:10:58] invited into him which is hid to the
[2:11:01] unbelievers by the veil of human flesh
[2:11:05] they know the glory they read of it it's
[2:11:10] in the word here the glory of God the
[2:11:13] things like that it's just a word to
[2:11:18] them to us it's a manifestation it's no
[2:11:24] more a word it's a reality oh my it's
[2:11:34] not a word anymore it's no more a word
[2:11:38] it's a reality because the word has
[2:11:42] become flesh
[2:11:47] God said let there be light but that was
[2:11:51] the word but now there is light it ain't
[2:11:58] the word it's the light you see what I
[2:12:02] mean
[2:12:03] now it's just a written word now it
[2:12:09] isn't just a written word to us it's a
[2:12:15] reality what is a reality it's the
[2:12:20] substance it's the realization of what
[2:12:23] something really is bold made clear
[2:12:28] unveil totally right there I can see the
[2:12:37] bride there's a substance in me that
[2:12:44] identifies with a substance at them I
[2:12:46] don't care where they go to church we're
[2:12:52] a part of something it's no more word
[2:13:00] you see what I mean
[2:13:01] it isn't just a written word to us it's
[2:13:04] a reality we are in him now we're
[2:13:09] enjoying now we're beholding him now
[2:13:13] we're seeing him the word manifesting
[2:13:17] himself it's hid out there because why
[2:13:21] it's failed in human flesh
[2:13:26] oh go past the veil George and accept
[2:13:31] and I don't know why I be honest with
[2:13:35] you I wouldn't have chosen any of you
[2:13:38] that shows you how stupid I know but he
[2:13:43] did and believe it or not you all had
[2:13:46] something in you that caused you to
[2:13:49] believe the word can't you have
[2:13:53] confidence in that
[2:13:56] that's what brother Ram said in perfect
[2:14:00] faith he said Jesus believed what God
[2:14:04] had made him he believed what the word
[2:14:09] said about him do you believe this
[2:14:14] message is the word do you believe what
[2:14:17] it says about it he says he walked by
[2:14:23] faith perfect faith the substance that
[2:14:27] was in him became the master of every
[2:14:31] circumstance and situation he lived by
[2:14:36] what was in him I did do nothing unless
[2:14:41] the father shows me first
[2:14:44] I do nothing unless the substance that's
[2:14:49] in me goes to work he says can't we
[2:14:54] believe what the word says we are so you
[2:15:02] say what's the new normal if the new
[2:15:05] normal is everybody running around with
[2:15:08] a mask isn't that just a perfect type
[2:15:11] [Music]
[2:15:14] it's a perfect type Satan's always
[2:15:17] masking always bad but praise God that
[2:15:23] substance that God's put in you it's
[2:15:27] going to arise to the occasion and
[2:15:29] there's going to be a new normal in the
[2:15:33] world today and that's a bride living by
[2:15:36] substance loving one another faith hope
[2:15:40] and charity these three the greatest of
[2:15:44] these three is the love of God the very
[2:15:49] thing that revealed that substance in
[2:15:51] you was the love of God god bless you
[2:15:54] don't don't be shaken you've got an
[2:15:59] anchor that holds
[2:16:01] you've got something that holds you
[2:16:03] solid it'll never break loose nope
[2:16:08] people say it's getting darker it's
[2:16:10] getting lighter they say oh it's getting
[2:16:15] bad the revelations getting sweeter
[2:16:18] oh it's falling apart he's coming closer
[2:16:22] hey man there's a deed that calleth to a
[2:16:26] deep god bless you calls me if you could
[2:16:28] come lead us in a song or two hey man

[2:16:36] for us if he's here Wednesday night and
[2:16:38] then I have a new way of telling people
[2:16:42] things I do it in public so anyway we're
[2:16:46] looking forward to that you love them
[2:16:48] too morning do you understand why can
[2:16:51] you rest
[2:16:53] why can you rest because despite
[2:16:56] yourself
[2:16:58] he created the substance in you and he
[2:17:04] looked at Paul and said Oh Saul Saul
[2:17:07] it's hard to kick against that substance
[2:17:12] that's in you it's hard to kick against
[2:17:18] the veil and and I know that's just the
[2:17:25] purpose of this whole nightmare we're in
[2:17:29] this for us to shake them confident to
[2:17:34] look someplace else instead of looking
[2:17:37] within
[2:17:38] I believe if you'll look inside you'll
[2:17:42] find that faiths there you'll find
[2:17:45] there's something in you that said as
[2:17:47] you know I don't understand this message
[2:17:49] a lot of it but I believe every word of
[2:17:52] it
[2:17:53] you'll feel you'll find that despite the
[2:17:56] weakness and failures of your flesh that
[2:18:00] there's still something in there amen
[2:18:04] let that rise to the occasion faith is
[2:18:10] the victory it'll win the victory
[2:18:14] I can look across the audience and
[2:18:16] people on streaming right now that I've
[2:18:19] seen that faith win the victory in their
[2:18:22] lives the Lord richly bless you tonight

[2:18:49] finish it some of us are just harder
[2:18:54] stones

[2:19:00] chiseling and chiseling and chiseling
[2:19:03] finally to get this the simplest
[2:19:05] understanding and one day the light just
[2:19:10] come on and I thought man I've been fine
