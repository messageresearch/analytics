Description:
Br. Billy Mbuyi
Sunday Morning Service
Christian Life Tabernacle
November 9th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

So Lord, we [music] we have friendships with one another. We enjoy each other's company, but we came here Lord to have an audience with you. And we pray father that you may [clears throat] speak to each and every individual person in this room only in a way that you can. Language [music] is not a barrier for you. You know our desires even before we have them and even before we ask them. I pray you may minister to every single heart Lord. Those that are brokenhearted that you may comfort them.

[music] As we stand, we'll turn to our psalm reading. We'll read in Psalm 6. It's it's a short psalm, so let's just read it all together from the 1st to the 10th. It reads, "Oh Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chastened me in thy heart displeasure. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak. Oh Lord, heal me, for my bones are vexed. My soul is also sore vexed. But thou, oh Lord, how long? Return, O Lord, deliver my soul. Oh, save me for thy mercy's sake. For in death there is no remembrance of thee. In the grave, who shall give thee thanks? I am weary with the groaning. All the night may guide my bed to swim. I water my couch with my tears. Mine eye is consumed because of grief. It waxeth old because of all mine enemies. Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity. For the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. The Lord had heard my supplication. The Lord will receive my prayer. Let all mine inities be ashamed and sore vexed. Let them return and be ashamed suddenly. Amen. May the Lord have a blessing to the reading of his word. You can turn around and shake somebody's hand. You may be seated. Let's sing Come and Dine. [clears throat] [music] Jesus had [singing] a table spread where the saints of God are fed.

Bless the clever to bring you special at this time. Bless you. How many enjoyed the message last Sunday about the vision that God had offer you and realizing that it's not even about us? It's about God expressing himself and he predestinated a right to be there and so that his word can be fulfilled. So he predestinated our lives so his purpose could be accomplished. So there's a song I grew up listening to a lot. I I doubt our musicians know it. So it'll be a little bit of throwing a a ringer into how they do things. But um I it is a blessing. Maybe a little bit of an ac capella, but if you know it, feel free to join it. So um I'll just start. So it's called justified. It it says he looked at your perfect picture without spot or wrinkle. He didn't look at you where you are now. He looked &gt;&gt; right back from eternity. He said you're just trapped in that body. You bypassed your theophony. If you've not done it in the first place, you're justified. So you may know it. If if you don't if you want to join me as I sing it, please do. I was sitting alone and wondering about what I'm supposed to do. I can't deny. At times I make mistakes. I can hide from him. He knew. But I knew that deep within my soul I felt sorry. Honest I did. So I just cried and said, "Forgive me, Lord. Forgive me again. Will you justify?" [snorts] Justified. You have not done it in the first [singing] place. You're justified. Justified. justified. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. So often I'm discouraged [music] when I count the times I fall. because he promised [singing] that I'll be victorious when I know that I'm not at all. Then I heard an eagle [singing and music] scream. Oh, its voice quickened my soul. He said, "You've [music and singing] not done it in the first place. You're justified." Oh, justified. Justified. You have [singing] not done it in the first place. [music] You're justified. Justified. Justified. You have [singing and music] not done it in the first place. You're justified. He looked at your [music and singing] perfect picture without blame, spot, or wrinkle. He didn't look at you [music] where you are now. He looked right from eternity. [singing] He said, "You're [music] just trapped in that [singing] body. You bypassed your theophony. You have not done it [music] in the first place. You're justified." Let's sing it together. Oh, justified. [music] Justified. [singing] Oh, you have not done [music] it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. Oh, [music and singing] justified. Oh, you have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Let's sing [music] that last verse together. Oh, he looked at your perfect picture without blame spot [music] or wrinkle. He [singing] didn't look at you where you are now. He looked [music] right from eternity. He said you're just trapped [music] in the body. You bypassed your theophony. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Oh, I'm justified. Oh, justified. Oh, you have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Justified. Oh, justine. [singing and music] You had not done it in the first place. You're justified. You had not [singing and music] done it in the first place. You're justified. [applause and music] Hallelujah. You have not done it in the first place. You're justified. Amen. Just have a couple of announcements. We want to remember our pastor. He's out preaching.

Brother Tim says, "There will be no Sunday school next [music] week during our meetings." Brother, this is unspoken says prayer for the marriage of Evelyn and Eddie Reyes.

[singing] [music] [singing] Let's just bow to our heads this morning. [music] Father, truly we could say that song is our heart's desire just being expressed. this morning, Father, [music] the your prophet will say that there's not one that has ever heard of you and I never want to see you, Lord. And Father, but the true believer when they hear of you, there's something in their hearts that really want to see you, Father, not with the eyes, but we could see you for who you really are, Lord. And and let you be revealed in our lives this morning. Father, we come this morning with all our weaknesses and our incapabilities and our trials and our temptation. Father, we know one thing that you purchased for all of those things that this morning [music] we can claim and and and be claiming you and know that in Christ we have all that we have need of. [music] Precious Father, those people we've gathered here this morning. Lord, I believe with all my heart that there's all kinds of need represented this morning in this building. But Lord, we know one thing that we serve a God that's above all our needs and our requests and our trials and our everything. May you come by the way of the word this morning and minister to your people. Father, may your word speak to our hearts that we may receive this [music] morning that portion which you have allotted for this morning. Father, let us not go the same way that we came in. But Lord that through your word and through the scriptures and through the promises that you made Lord that we may become partakers of divine nature. We commit all that we are into your hands Lord every time we come to you Lord. Father Satan try to expose our flesh and our inabilities and all that we've done. But Lord, even as we heard the song this morning, that you look at us, oh Father, not from what we are this morning, [music] but you look at us from eternity and the purchase price that you already gave, Lord. And that's how we want to stand before you, Lord. And we stand before you with confidence knowing that [music] even though we can see it with our own eyes, Father, it means nothing but because you took away all our iniquity. Father, come and speak to our hearts, Lord. Come, Father, be the comforter this morning for whatever need of if there's need for healing and deliverance or whatever, Father, be the comforter and be the one who can supply all of those things, [music] we commit this service into your hands. And we ask this things in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. God bless. You may have your seats just for a moment before we read our scriptures. Um, just want to emphasize once again on the uh uh the communication and the announcements that's been made. If you could put that flyer out there. So, our meetings are uh starting on Friday and uh I we we really want to do everything that we can uh to to come to church. Amen. I I I I can read quotes why you should be in church. I can do all of that, but I just want to add this morning that it's a blessing for us. &gt;&gt; It's a blessing for you. If you if you're going to miss work to come to the services, I believe with all my heart that God is obligated to return to you a hundfold. &gt;&gt; Is that scripture? Is that the message? So, if we could do all that we can, I whether it be taking off or or whatever, if you need assistance with gas money or whatever, we're here to help so you can be in church. Amen. So, want everybody to come and and and if you get out of work late and you are in your work clothes and you're tired, you're hungry, we'll provide sandwiches. Amen. Well, if you need if you need us to provide you a change of clothes, we'll do that, too. Amen. &gt;&gt; We really want you to come to the house of God. &gt;&gt; So, so, uh, Brother Tom and brother Michael Ray will be ministering. So, uh, we want to come expecting. And they there's just something about special meetings that I believe with all my heart that there are things that happen in special meetings that otherwise don't happen in services like this. Why is is the way God set it? Because when we come to special meetings, our expectation is really high. People come and and and where expectation and desires and and we come on uh with one heart and one accord and uh one spirit. I believe that unity causes God to come down and do more. Amen. And that's how we want to do. We want to come and and do all that we can. So, uh, the the as the announcement was made, we want to make sure there'll be, uh, we have our service on Fridays at 700 p.m. Uh, uh, sandwiches will be provided after service. The fellowship service on Saturdays, uh, we will have barbecue, so it's going to be from 12 to 3:00 p.m. as listed on the board over there. And the service on Saturday will start at 6 pm. Um the Sunday service is at 11:00 a.m. for the morning service and the 6 pm our singing service. So we we really I believe that's part of what we do. We really enjoy our singing service and have many just come back to the house of God and and sing more services. So for parking, we really asking for those especially young people, if you can carpool, please do so. and all of our young people when you come in, just try to make sure you park in the very back uh by the Gaga ball on the wall side over there. So, you can uh we'll try to uh uh uh you be over there and so we can try to make uh uh parking available for everybody. And uh uh we want to apologize for the bathrooms. There's uh work that's being done. Uh we'll believe it'll be ready uh by Friday. Uh the contractors are still working on the women's bathroom to get it ready and everything. So the bathrooms are available for sisters in the old fellowship hall. There's one in the kitchen. So if you need just uh uh uh you can use that for now. Want to remember our pastor and and he's believe I believe he's preaching this morning. I'm not sure if he's already on the pulpit or not, but we want to just keep him on our heart this morning. Brother Matthew is in Tennessee preaching and brother Donnie. So we want to also just remember him this morning. Amen. How many are happy to be in the house of God this morning? How many I believe believe that it's a blessing to come to the house of God? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's all stand for our scripture reading this morning. Amen. Let's start in Colossians uh chap the the first chapter. will read um let's start from verse 22. Let's start from 19. It says for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell. and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto him. By him I say, whether be things in earth or things in heaven. And you that were sometimes alienated and enemies of your mind by wicked work. Yet now had he reconciled, think about that, in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight. If ye continue in faith, grounded and settled, and be not move away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, which we was preached, through every uh creature which is under heaven, wherefore I Paul am a minister whom, it says, who now rejoice in his suffering for you and fill up that which is behind of the affliction of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church. Wherefore am I a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God, even the mystery which had hid from ages and from generation, but now is made manifest to s to his saints. To whom to whom God made known that which that what is the riches of the glory of the mystery among the Gentile which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. I want you to realize that. So the preaching of Christ in you is that at the end that every man may be presented righteous. You may be seated. Keep your Bible open. We're going to read one more. Uh let's read in Romans chapter 1. Romans chapter 1. Um and let's start from uh [snorts] verse 9. It says, "But ye are not in the flesh, but ye are in the spirit. If if so be that the spirit of God dwells in you. Now if any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the spirit of him that raisth Christ from the dead dwell in you, that uh he that raisth Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwell in you. Therefore, brethren, we are not debtors. We are we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh. But if we live but if we live after the flesh ye shall die. But if you live through the spirit do mortify but if ye through the spirit do motify the dead of the flesh ye shall live. For as many that are led as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God. For ye are not, ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." The spirit of it, the spirit itself beareth witness, we are without spirit that we are the children of God. And if children, then hes of God and join with Christ. If so be that we suffer with him, that we may also glorify together. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. For the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God. For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope, because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groanth and travaleth in pain together until now, and all only they also which have the first fruit of the spirit, even we all ourselves grown within ourselves, waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our bodies. Let's just bow our heads. Gracious father, we ask that you bless your word to us in Jesus name we pray. Amen. To this morning, I just want to speak for a little bit this morning. Um the the thought that really came to my heart um as I was looking at this um give me a second is um Christ in you. Christ in you. And no doubt I you you say I've heard of that before and I I could say I I did the same. But just this morning uh not this morning, but just studying this, it just kind of opened up to me uh what even what even what that means. And I said, do I even myself understand when I say Christ in me, what does that even mean? Uh because if you if you I was even talking about Andrew in the back. We our pastor has been preaching and he touched on the message the uh invisible union. And and if you look at the invisible union, God tells you who you really are and where you came from. And and if you go back now and listen to Christ the mystery of God revealed in God in that message is actually walking you through the process that it took so you can understand what invisible union is there for. So Christ the mystery of of God revealed is basically the process by which God laid the hope land a and and and accomplished the hope land. So at the end when the revelation is made known you will understand what has been happening for ages since the beginning of time. So we when we look at it when we say Christ in us we I want us this morning to to understand that Christ in you is the reason for the whole entire creation. That one statement when when I say Christ in you is the reason for the galaxy, the world, the planets, the everything that you see. It's all based on the one reason, one statement. Christ in you. Christ in you was God desire to have fellowship with another God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ in you is is the whole plan of redemption. God wanting to after after he's created seas and he's created trees and is created. He wasn't satisfied until he saw someone that looked like himself. &gt;&gt; Christ in you is the desire for God to have fellowship. Christ in you is the beginning and the ending of the whole mystery. &gt;&gt; That's why I said I I I asked myself, do I even understand what that means? Well, and let me say this. What the devil is fighting us for is not that we don't have a God in heaven. He knows everybody believes that. It's not that we had Christ that came and died for us. He knows all the churches on the streets believe that. But what the devil is fighting us this morning is the revelation of Christ abiding in you this morning. is the revelation that we are not made to be just a bunch of people that come here to have wives, to have children and work and do all that we can and then somehow we do enough good to go back in heaven. No, that the whole purpose, the whole mystery of creation was that God wanted to have a bride. that God wanted to create somebody that look like him, somebody that talk like him, somebody that he can have fellowship with, somebody that he can say and they will understand that they will be on the same level with. God didn't want, let me say this, when he wanted to be God, he created angels for that. &gt;&gt; When he wanted to be God, he made the creation for that. But that was not the purpose for your creation. Your creation was to be exactly like he was so you can be beside him that he can talk and have fellowship with you. &gt;&gt; So Christ in you is the whole thing. BUT WHEN SAYS CHRIST IN YOU, HE SAYS CHRIST IS THE CENTER OF THE WHOLE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So when we say it's the we we we if I could just and I'm trying to just &gt;&gt; the understanding that God had a purpose in the beginning that included you the the purpose and let me say this when not that included you as an afterthought but the main character in the whole process. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? You were the reason for the creation. &gt;&gt; He He COULD HAVE DWELLED ALONE. HE COULD HAVE JUST CREATED angels and and then just be WORSHIPED DAY AND NIGHT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR. HE WAS LOOKING FOR FELLOWSHIP. SOMEONE THAT LOOKED LIKE HIM, &gt;&gt; SOMEONE THAT TALKED LIKE HIM, SOMEONE THAT ACTED LIKE HIM, SOMEONE THAT HE CAN TALK THAT WILL UNDERSTAND. LET ME SAY THIS. THE ANGELS DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD IS TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; THEY THEY WORSHIP HIM. HOLY, HOLY, HOLY. He will say and he WILL DIRECT THEM GO. I IF THEY GOD LOOKS AN ANGEL AND THEY SAID I'M A HEALER. THAT MEANS NOTHING TO THE ANGEL BUT IT MEANS SOMETHING FOR YOU THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; SO CHRIST IN YOU IS THE REASON FOR THE ENTIRE THING. And let me say this. I'm just going to jump for a little bit. So, if I get too excited, forgive me. Uh, you know, I I I you know, I I just feel like uh uh these things are given for us to be living IN HEAVENLY PLACES. THEY'RE NOT GIVEN for us to be mortal PEOPLE THINKING LIKE MORTAL AND TALKING LIKE MORTAL, ACTING LIKE MORTAL. NO, THEY ARE GIVEN TO YOU SO YOU CAN TAKE YOUR LIFE AND rearrange it and understand that the original purpose OF YOUR CREATION IS THAT SO YOU COULD BE GOD TO BEGIN WITH. &gt;&gt; SO, so there was uh the scripture would talk there was anything created. SO, GOD UH UH THOUGHTS of you in the beginning. You were not made uh uh uh to be just uh another portion of the creation but you were made to be part of the eternal. So remember the scripture says heaven and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away. And let me even make the statement that's why the revealing of the end time when the prophet comes he says that you YOU COULDN'T EVEN YOU CAN'T YOU CANNOT OBTAIN ETERNAL LIFE UNLESS YOU HAD eternal life. So the reason why he's connecting that is he's wanting YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS IS ONLY THE MANIFESTATION OF WHAT ALREADY EXISTED THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT INTO VIEW. IT'S NOT SOMETHING NEW. IT'S ONLY EXACTLY WHAT WAS IN THE BEGINNING THAT'S BEEN MADE manifest in the end. &gt;&gt; SO SO SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THE END TIME, IT GIVES US A CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT WAS IN THE BEGINNING. SO THE GOD'S DESIRE, WHAT I'M WILL SAY IN uh uh God's a mystery of God uh uh Christ the mystery of God reveal and I'm paraphrasing this so I can just lay a foundation. GOD'S DESIRE WAS TO HAVE A FAMILY. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED TO BE A family man. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? When you WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOURSELF, YOU SEE YOU HAVE CHILDREN AND YOU HAVE A WIFE AND YOU GO, YOU LAY YOUR LIFE DOWN, YOU SACRIFICE YOURSELF, YOU WORK, YOU DO ALL OF THAT WITH WITH THE OBJECTIVE, NO MATTER HOW THEY TREAT YOU, YOU STILL LAY YOUR LIFE DOWN FOR THEM. IT THAT'S NOT YOU. THAT'S THE ATTRIBUTE THAT WAS PLACED IN YOU so you CAN SEE WHO GOD IS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I I I THINK SOMETIMES WE FORGET THAT THE THE VERY heavenly thing or THE THINGS OF GOD ARE ALSO MANIFESTED IN THE NATURE. SO IT WASN'T AND I'M SAYING THAT TO SAY THAT IT'S A LOVE THAT'S WITHOUT UH H THAT'S GIVEN WITHOUT ANYTHING IN EXPECTATION. THE PART OF the human mind IS THAT EVERY TIME LOVE IS GIVEN or or a gift is given there's an expectation FOR SOMETHING BAD. BUT WHEN YOU COME TO THE LOVE OF GOD, THERE IS SUCH A LOVE WHERE IT'S GIVEN WITHOUT EVEN THE PERSON RECOGNIZE IT. WHEN THE PERSON WAS RUNNING AWAY, WHEN THE PERSON WAS DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, THEY WERE CRITICIZES AND CALL IT ALL KIND OF NAME. THAT LOVE WAS STILL THERE PRESENT KNOWING THAT IT WAS THERE GIVEN THAT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER YOU WILL COME BACK to it. &gt;&gt; AND AND THAT'S WHEN WE SAY HE WANTED A FAMILY. HE WANTED SONS AND DAUGHTERS. HE DIDN'T JUST WANT ANGELS. HE WANTED PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE HIM. GOD DID NOT WANT TO DWELL ALONE. &gt;&gt; Why is it we don't want to dwell alone? Why is it the scripture will tell us that a man shall live uh uh his family and he will attach himself to his wife and everything? IT IT'S NOT BY HAPPEN CHANCE. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT GOD ESTABLISHED EVEN WITHIN the mortal life. So we can understand the very MYSTERY OF WHAT GOD IS DOING. SO HIS NATURE, HIS LOVE UH WAS TO BE EXPRESSED. Are you with me this morning? SO IF GOD WAS LOVE, SOMEHOW THAT LOVE HAS TO COME INTO SOME FORM OF AN EXPRESSION. &gt;&gt; HE HE COULDN'T CLAIM TO BE LOVE AND NEVER HAVE A PLACE FOR HIM TO MANIFEST that love. HE COULDN'T CLAIM TO BE A SAVIOR AND NEVER HAVE A CHANCE TO MANIFEST THAT SAVING POWER. HE COULDN'T CLAIM TO be a healer and NEVER HAVE A POSITION BY WHICH AND LET ME SAY THAT HE COULDN'T MANIFEST THAT TO THE ANGELS. HE HAD TO HAVE SOMEBODY THAT LOOKED LIKE HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, AND GOD WANTED TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. HE WANTED TO BE A SAVIOR. HE WANTED TO BE ALL THOSE THINGS. AND HE WANTED TO BE A FATHER, A SAVIOR, HEALER, REDEEMER. AND ALL THOSE THINGS WERE WAITING to be uh uh uh uh expressed. SO GOD'S NATURE AND LET ME SAY this the and when I speak about God's nature, a nature, it's not it's something that that you were and you remain that way. &gt;&gt; You you with me this morning? SO IT'S BUT BUT SAID IT WILL TAKE ETERNITY FOR GOD TO EXPRESS HIMSELF. SO THAT IF GOD IS A SAVIOR THAT NATURE OF SAVING CONTINUES. &gt;&gt; You understand? SO AND LET ME SAY THIS. THAT'S WHY GOD STILL SAVES THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY GOD STILL HEALS THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; SO HE HE CANNOT HAVE A NATURE THAT SOMEHOW THROUGH THE PROCESS WILL STOP. AND LET ME SAY THIS. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT WE REALIZE WHEN WE SAY CHRIST IN US, WHEN THE SAME NATURE COMES UPON YOU, IT WILL MANIFEST THE SAME ATTRIBUTES OF GOD IN YOU. &gt;&gt; So it's NOT A NATURE THAT STARTS IN GOD, BUT THEN WHEN YOU ARE SAVED, THE NATURE STOP. NO, THOSE THAT ARE PARTAKERS OF THE SAME NATURE WILL DISPLAY THE SAME ATTRIBUTES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO HE HE CONTINUALLY WHEN WHEN HE COMES AND AND THE PURPOSE FOR CHRIST IN YOU IS FOR GOD TO EXTEND OR TO CONTINUALLY EXPRESS THOSE SAME ATTRIBUTE THAT HE WAS IN THE BEGINNING. THE SAME ATTRIBUTE THAT WAS EXPRESSED IN CHRIST. THOSE ATTRIBUTES HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED in you this morning that are sitting here. SO WHEN HE STARTS AS HIS CREATION IN THE BEGINNING and and I was just reading this it he it started his creation in the beginning. HE EXPRESSED HIMSELF IN STAGES THE PROPHET will say revealing himself in portion until he he created the trees and he created the earth and and and THE THE THE FULL EXPRESSION OF WHO he was. HE DIDN'T STOP HIS EXPRESSING. HE DIDN'T REST UNTIL HE CREATED SOMETHING that looked like himself. &gt;&gt; So when we WHEN WE LOOK AT EVEN THE VERY CREATION, HE HE SAID, "LET US MAKE MAN IN our image." Now when you go back IN THE SCRIPTURE, BUT WHEN IT WILL SHOW us the man that was created created in Genesis uh 1 and 26 27, it says, "Let us make man in our image, in our likeness." Butam says that was the spirit man. &gt;&gt; And then IF YOU GO TO GENESIS AND I'm just going fast for the sake of time so I can save time and continue on. IN GENESIS CHAPTER 2 AND 7 IT SAYS and the Lord formed man of the dust of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils uh the breath of life and man became a living soul. SO WHAT DID GOD DO? GOD TOOK THE SPIRIT man that was created in his own image and he took that spirit man and he placed him in the flesh. &gt;&gt; WHY DID GOD TAKE THE SPIRIT MAN AND PLACING him in the flesh? SO THAT SPIRIT MAN could express himself. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? SO THAT SPIRIT MAN BECAUSE REMEMBER TO THAT SPIRIT man it was GIVEN THE THE POWER or the dominion over the earth. It was given FOR HIM TO SUBDUE ALL THE THINGS. AND HE COULDN'T DO IT JUST BEING AS A SPIRIT. HE NEEDED A FLESH FOR THE EXPRESSION TO BE MADE. SO GOD TOOK THE SPIRIT MAN AND PLACED HIM IN THE FLESH SO HE CAN CONQUER THE GARDEN OR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT HE WAS IN. BUT LET ME SAY THIS, BUT THE MAN THAT GOD CREATED IN THE IMAGE WAS THE SPIRIT MAN. &gt;&gt; MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE GARDEN OF EDEN. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU THIS MORNING. YOU ARE THE SPIRIT MAN THAT GOD CREATED. THE FLESH WAS GIVEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE EXPRESSION. &gt;&gt; THE FLESH IS NOT THE EXPRESSION. THE SPIRIT IS THE EXPRESSION THAT CAME FROM GOD. THE FLESH IS GIVEN SO THAT WHICH IS SPIRIT IN YOU CAN BE EXPRESSED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are you with ME THIS MORNING? BUT SAYS WE NEVER EVEN see one another. &gt;&gt; Are you with me THIS MORNING? YOU AND I HAVE REALLY NEVER MET. WHY? BECAUSE THE REAL YOU IS NOT THE FLESH. THE REAL YOU IS THE SPIRIT THAT DWELLS IN YOU. ALL THAT THE SPIRIT IS TRYING TO DO IS TO USE THIS MODEL OF FLESH TO EXPRESS ITSELF. SO THEREFORE, BY YOUR ACTION, WE THINK WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE. BUT THE REAL YOU HAS NEVER BEEN EXPRESSED. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY HINDRANCE IN THIS FLESH. &gt;&gt; SO MANY HINDRANCE. WHEN I WANT TO DO GOOD, EVIL IS PRESENT RIGHT THERE. BUT MY SISTER, BUT THIS TIME IN THE [screaming] END TIME, GOD PROMISED, GOD MADE A PROMISE THAT THE FULLNESS OF WHO YOU ARE WILL BE MANIFESTED. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE FULLNESS OF WHO YOU ARE, NOT SOME PARTIAL UNDERSTANDING, BUT THE FULL WORD OF GOD OF WHAT YOU WERE IN THE BEGINNING IS TO BE MANIFESTED IN THAT FLESH. &gt;&gt; I Oh, we live so below our privileges. My brother said we we we THE DEVIL IS GOT US SO TWISTED. We we look at our flesh. Oh, I see Ben AND OH [clears throat] I TELL YOU WHAT BUT WHAT WHAT IF BEN CHANGE form &gt;&gt; you you SEE WHAT I'M SAYING? WHAT WHAT WHAT THE THE THE THROUGH THE FLESH THAT'S WHY SAYS IF SOMEBODY DOES SOMETHING WRONG it says it says THE POOR BROTHER HE'S TRYING THE BEST THAT HE CAN BUT IT'S THE ENEMY THAT CAUSE HIM TO DO IT. WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE AN ENEMY WHO'S CONSTANTLY COMING INTO OUR WAY OF EXPRESSION. OUR HEARTS DESIRE TO EXPRESS GOD. UH WE WANT TO DO WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO. BUT YET WE HAVE THIS FLESH THAT WE HAVE TO CONTEND WITH EVERY DAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; SO AT THE SAME NOW he so he he the he created and the like I said IT WAS THE SAME LIFE. NOW HE says the same love that was in Christ now flows in the people completing the cycle and this is just me saying completing the cycle of redemption. God manifesting in the flesh again. So the the the the reason the whole reason for the expression is THAT HE'S GOD. HE wants one that looks like him. THE DEVIL COMES AND HE BREAKS THE WHOLE PLAN. BUT THEN GOD THROUGH THE END TIME HE COMES BACK AS NOW RESTORING THE FULL EXPRESSION OF WHAT HE WANTED FROM the beginning. Now I want you to listen to what the prophet the prophet will speak. SO THE PROPHET SAYS IN THE MESSAGE deity I'm sorry just give me a second deity of Jesus Christ. He says paragraph 79 he says deity of him of him. PARAGRAPH 79 OF WHO? He asked who is he? HE SAYS SOME OF THEM THINK THAT he's a little baby back in the main baby back there. He's he's one is one that stood on the invisible the platform and reach out his hand and he spoke and said let there be light and there was light. That was Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ in you. So So are you are YOU FOLLOWING? HE WAS IN the world and the world was made by him and the world recognized him not. He was He's the deity OF GOD. LOOK WHAT HE DID BACK THERE. TALK ABOUT THE MIRA THE MIRACULOUS back there. YOU TALK ABOUT SHOUTING WHEN HE PERFORMED THE MIRACLE THINGS. HE SAYS THAT MAKE THINGS THAT WAS NOT WHAT THAT WHICH is now OUT OF THINGS THAT WAS NOT. HE SPOKE AND IT WAS SO. Now remember says that he quoted THE BOOK OF JOB. HE SAYS YOU SHOUTED WITH JOY IN THE BEGINNING. WHAT WAS IT? HE'S TALKING ABOUT THIS SCRIPTURE HERE. WE WERE THERE WITH HIM. AND AS CREATION IS BEING MADE, WE ARE SHOUTING WITH JOY. WHY? BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING THE MANIFESTATION OF WHAT WAS TO BE. NOW HE CONTINUED ON AND HE SAYS he spoke so and then uh uh uh he spoke. HE SPOKE AND IT WAS SO. AND THAT SAME POWER, HE SAYS, PARAGRAPH 80, THAT SAME POWER, THAT SAME CHRIST, HALLELUJAH, LET THE FUNDAMENTALIST, LET THEM PEOPLE WHO DENY THE POWER OF GOD SAY IT'S WRONG. BUT THAT SAME POWER THAT SPOKE THE WORLD INTO EXISTENCE IS IN THOSE WHO'S GOT THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO CHRIST IN YOU IS THE POWER THAT MADE THE WORD COME TO EXISTENCE. OH, THAT'S WHY WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE WORD MADE FLESH. IT IT IT'S TO COME TO AND MY BROTHER AND MY SISTER, LET ME SAY THIS. UH SIN IS TO CAUSE YOU TO DISBELIEVE WHAT THE WORD SAID ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You understand that? &gt;&gt; AND AND WHEN YOU DO THAT, IT CREATES SEPARATION. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND THAT? WHAT GOD WANTS US TO DO THIS MORNING IS TO BELIEVE WHAT THE SCRIPTURES ARE SAYING AND TO WALK IN IT SO THE THINGS WHICH ARE SPOKEN WILL COME INTO MANIFESTATION. &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT GOT THE HOLY GHOST. THAT'S RIGHT. MEN AND WOMAN, IT'S IT IT SAYS IT IT'S TIME THAT WE FOUND OUT WHO YOU WHO YOU ARE. THE DEVIL IS TRYING TO HIDE YOU BACK. TELL YOU THAT you are some little tro downtrodden something. You are not. You are. You are the son and daughter of God. Deity is not in heaven. It's in you. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE SAYS, "I know you THINK I'M CRAZY, BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, BROTHER. WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT THE ALMIGHTY GOD LIVES IN YOU, IMMORTAL LIFE, MY LIFE, I I GAVE I GAVE ZOE THE LIFE OF GOD IS IN A HUMAN BEING. And let ME SAY THIS, THAT'S WHAT GOD WANTS US TO WALK BY THIS MORNING. He he HE'S NOT INTERESTED IN US UH UH COMING AND GETTING some theology of some understanding. Oh, you know, THIS IS THE PROGRAM. If you do this, then you become IF YOU DO. NO, THAT THAT'S WHAT THE DEVILS TRY TO GIVE EVE IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. YOU ALREADY ARE THE SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; YOU ALREADY HAVE MADE IT. YOU ALREADY HEALED. YOU'RE ALREADY SAVED. WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS TO BELIEVE SO HE CAN COME INTO MANIFESTATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [snorts] &gt;&gt; HE CONTINUES ON PARAGRAPH 82. He says, "And brothers and sister, that deity is in you, and a little while the world will see me no more. Yet ye shall see me, for I'll be with you even in you until the end of the age." until the end of the age. Uh Christ in the manger. No, Christ in you. Hallelujah. We are NOT WORSHIPING CHRIST in the manger, but Christ in you, the Holy Ghost, the hope of glory, the creator, GOD HIMSELF DWELLING IN the human being. &gt;&gt; And let me just say THIS THIS MORNING, IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO GRASP THIS UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT CALLS FOR IT. YOU HEARD WHAT HE SAID. WE ARE NOT WORSHIPING CHRIST IN MANGER, BUT WE ARE WORSHIPING CHRIST IN YOU. IN OTHER WORD, WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD OF GOD, THERE HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN YOUR HEART THAT ANCHORS ON AND RESPOND AND IT SAYS, "I KNOW THERE'S A GOD IN ME. I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING IN ME. I KNOW THERE'S A HEART IN ME THAT WANTS TO SEE THIS THING TO come to pass." and and prophet I I couldn't find a quote, but he said JESUS WHAT JESUS CAME to do IS TO ROLL BACK THE CLOUD THAT CAME AND STOP YOU FROM REALIZING WHO YOU WERE SO YOU CAN COME INTO THE FULL understanding of who you are and act upon it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The message has come to take what would always what was always been. IT'S NOT THE DIDN'T COME TO TELL you something that never existed. &gt;&gt; WE WE IT'S NOT WHAT BUT WHAT WAS LACKING WAS THE REVELATION OF IT &gt;&gt; WAS THE OPENING OF IT BECAUSE REMEMBER HE SAYS THIS IS THE MYSTERY THAT WAS HID SINCE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. AND THE PROPHET WILL TALK ABOUT HOW YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE BIBLE. IT WAS CHRIST IN MOSES. IT WAS CHRIST IN DAVID. IT WAS CHRIST. IT WAS ALWAYS CHRIST. WHAT IS CHRIST? IS THE ANOINTED WORD OF GOD MAKING HIMSELF MANIFESTED IN THE HUMAN BEING. THAT'S WHY HE WILL LOOK AT YOU AND HE SAYS, "LET ME TELL YOU THIS. THOSE MEN ARE MADE LIKE PASSION LIKE YOU ARE. IT WASN'T THEM THAT DID IT. IT WAS THE CHRIST IN THEM THAT MADE IT HAPPEN." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT WAS HE SAYING? SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THE SAME GOD WHO MADE IT HAPPEN FOR THEM. THE SAME GOD IS HERE TO MAKE HIS WORD FOR THIS HOUR HAPPEN IN YOU ALSO. &gt;&gt; It's the answer TO THE CRY OF THE predestinated seed. Because when when WE WHEN WE GET SICK OR WHEN WE SEE A TEMPTATION AND WHEN WE SEE THIS THING, THERE HAS TO BE A HEART CRY FOR YOU TO OVERCOME THOSE THINGS. &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN'T LIVE DAY IN AND DAY OUT IN SIN and just be satisfied. &gt;&gt; THE THE PREDESTINATED IS NOT BUILT THAT WAY. &gt;&gt; WE DO WRONG, YES, BUT SOMETHING IN HIS HEART &gt;&gt; WANTS TO OVERCOME THAT. SOMETHING IN HIS HEART IS LOOKING ACROSS THE SHADOW, JUST LOOKING ACROSS THE HORIZON AND KNOW ONE DAY THIS IS GOING TO COME TO STOP. &gt;&gt; THEY THEY MAY STRUGGLE DAY IN AND DAY OUT, BUT THERE'S A HEARTBEAT IN THEM THAT'S LOOKING AND CALLING FORTH AND KNOWING THAT ONE DAY I'M GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU THIS. THIS WORLD CAN GET OUT OF SHAPE AS IT IS AND ALL THE THINGS. LET ME TELL YOU THIS. WE ARE NOT HERE TO STAY HERE. WE ARE HERE SO WE CAN GO HOME. WE ARE HERE TO MANIFEST CHRIST AND THEN GO HOME. &gt;&gt; So sin is the representation of the unbelief. Sin is what caused the separation. And as long as we live in we live our lives in disbelief because remember the prophet said in the invisible union that you cannot be married at both at the same time. You cannot be the old you and the new you at the same time. &gt;&gt; That you got to divorce and kill that other husband. And that other husband is just flesh that we have. &gt;&gt; So he and let me say this, I'm trying to WALK YOU THROUGH THE process of even how the invisible union is coming to manifestation. So he he's WANTING US TO UNDERSTAND that the unbelief when you disbelieve the word of God, YOU ARE DISBELIEVING OR TAKING YOURSELF OUT OF THE PROGRAM OF GOD OR THE ability to receive that which was spoken for you. &gt;&gt; THE PROPHET A PASTOR WROTE that he read that quote the other day where IT SAYS THE PREACHING OF THE WORD is the forgiveness OF ALL OUR SINS. MEANING WHEN WE RECEIVE THE FORGIVENESS, WE AUTOMATICALLY GET INTO THE PROGRAM OF GOD TO RECEIVE WHAT WAS SPOKEN OF US. BUT WHEN WE REJECT THE WORD OF GOD, when we LEAVE THE WORD OF GOD, WHEN WE DISBELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD, IT BECOMES IMPOSSIBLE FOR THAT PROGRAM TO TAKE HOLD. &gt;&gt; So what we need IS THE SEPARATION FROM THE UNBELIEF, EVERYTHING THAT DISBELIEF. BUT WHEN I'M SAYS YOU DON'T TAKE ONE WORD OR TAKE AWAY, ADD OR TAKE AWAY. YOU BELIEVE IT JUST THE WAY IT WAS SPOKEN. AND GOD IS RESPONSIBLE TO COME TO BRING IT TO PASS. &gt;&gt; MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, I KNOW AS HUMANS, YOUR FLESH TALKS TO YOU EVERY DAY. YOUR FLESH WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU CAN DO. YOUR FLESH WILL TELL YOU HOW YOU FELL SHORT. IN FACT, I NEVER HAD MY FLESH TELL ME ANYTHING GOOD. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO COME, BROTHER SAYS, YOU GOT TO DOUBT YOUR OWN DOUBTS. YOU GOT TO DOUBT YOUR OWN FLESH. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THE WORD OF GOD SO THE SUPERNATURAL CAN HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I NEVER HAD MY FLESH COME TO ME AND SAY, "MAN, YOU'RE the best Christian that I know." Man, if he did, I would be very nervous. You see it? IT'S A CONSTANT FIGHT. AND WHAT WE NEED TO COME TO THE UNDERSTANDING IS THE UNBELIEF WILL OPEN THE DOOR TO FEAR, TO SHAME, TO CONDEMNATION. THE UNBELIEF WILL OPEN THE DOOR SO SATAN CAN accuse you. &gt;&gt; BUT BUT I LOVE THE PROPHET IN THE INVISIBLE UNION. HE SAID, "You you didn't even do that. YOU WERE TRICKED INTO THAT." SO SO IF YOU REALLY GOT THE REVELATION, WHEN SATAN IS ACCUSING YOU, HE'S only accusing himself. &gt;&gt; THE WHATEVER ACCUSATION IS LAYING ON YOU, IT'S ONLY HIMSELF. WHY? BECAUSE HE'S THE ONE WHO TRICKED YOU INTO IT. YOU'D NEVER DONE IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. IN FACT, THE PROPHET SAY YOU ARE NOT FORGIVEN, BUT YOU ARE JUSTIFIED. AND WHAT IS JUSTIFIED? JUSTIFIED DOESN'T MEAN MEANS THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN PARTAKE OF IT. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS YOUR FLESH THAT DID THAT. THE REAL [screaming] YOU THAT YOU WERE, THE SEED OF GOD THAT WERE COULD NOT PARTAKE OF SUCH THING. WHY? BECAUSE IT WAS MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD AND HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WORLD. BUT IT'S BY FAITH &gt;&gt; THAT WE OBTAIN of those things. &gt;&gt; IT WHAT WHAT THE DEVIL WANTS YOU TO DO IS SIN WILL BREAK THE FELLOWSHIP. &gt;&gt; Are you with ME THIS MORNING? SIN WILL BREAK THE FELLOWSHIP AND IT WILL UH UH PUT AN ADVERSE RELATIONSHIP between you AND GOD WHERE YOU THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE A BELIEVER, you start to feel condemnation when you come in the presence of God. &gt;&gt; How many knows what I'm talking about this morning? &gt;&gt; YOU THAT ARE CREATED TO BE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD, YOU START TO MAKE UP A THINKING IN YOUR OWN MIND THAT SOMEHOW GOD IS AGAINST YOU. THAT SOMEHOW GOD WANTS TO PUNISH YOU. WHY WOULD HE PUNISH HIMSELF? &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S SIN THAT CAUSED THAT. HE CAME AND HE CAUSED THE FAILURE AND HE CAME AND IS THE ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN. BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THIS MORNING THAT MY BROTHER, THE WORD HAS BEEN GIVEN TO YOU SO YOU CAN OVERCOME WITH THE WORD OF GOD. AND then when he accuses you, the next step is &gt;&gt; he now wants you to create the religion. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; Oh, now if you can go and give the money to the poor and do this, do this, it will help you feel a little bit better about yourself. The scripture says if we can add one cube &gt;&gt; to a statue, Christ died in vain. &gt;&gt; Not that we should not do good do good works, but the good works that are done is the expression of the life of Christ that's inside of us. IT'S NOT DONE IN GUILT SO WE CAN find some kind of religion and feel comfortable about ourselves. Oh, I'LL JUST GO DO THIS. WHY? IT'S A COVERING. GOD DON'T WANT A COVERING THIS MORNING. GOD DON'T WANT A RELATION THIS MORNING. GOD WANTS US TO COME AND CONFESS OUR SINS AND AND SAY, "ABA, FATHER," AND RECEIVE THE FULL PRICE OF WHAT'S BEEN PAID FOR. &gt;&gt; So Christ died so you don't have to pay for your sins. Let me say that again. Christ died &gt;&gt; so you don't have to pay for your sins. &gt;&gt; And I I I just think that went over our heads. Christ died so you do not have to pay for YOUR SINS &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMEHOW WE GET INTO THIS RELIGIOUS spirit that when something happened, it's us paying for our sins. &gt;&gt; Are you with me THIS MORNING? THAT IF SOMETHING BAD OR SOMETHING IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN, ALL OF THE SUDDEN OUR SINS, OUR PAST IS CATCHING BACK WITH US. CHRIST DIED SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR YOUR SINS. &gt;&gt; HE CANNOT HE DIDN'T DIE FOR THE PARTIAL PAYMENT. HE DIED FOR THE FULL PAYMENT. &gt;&gt; HE DIED SO HE CAN REMOVE THE BARRIER, THE SEPARATION. HIS BLOOD WAS ABLE TO CLEAN ALL THINGS. AND AND LET ME SAY THIS &gt;&gt; INVISIBLE UNION BUTAM SAYS HIS BLOOD WAS THE WHEN YOUR SIN GOT INTO THE BLOOD NOT ONLY IT WAS COMPLETELY DISSOLVED IT NEVER EXISTED. &gt;&gt; THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST THIS MORNING IS ABLE TO TAKE A RANK SINNER AND MAKE HIM AS IF HE WAS NEVER SINNER BEFORE. NEVER DONE IT. SO DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT YOUR PAST BECAUSE AS LONG AS GOD IS CONCERNED, AS FAR AS GOD IS CONCERNED, THAT PAST DOESN'T EXIST ANYMORE. &gt;&gt; HE TOOK IT AWAY. HE MADE IT DISAPPEAR. &gt;&gt; You starting brand new today. The scripture says his mercies are brand new every morning. &gt;&gt; When you wake up in the morning, DON'T THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED. I DON'T CARE IF YOU KILLED SOMEBODY YESTERDAY. WHEN YOU WAKE UP THIS MORNING, IT'S A BRAND NEW MORNING. GOD HAS GIVEN YOU HIS MERCY. GOD HAS GIVEN YOU. YOU ARE STARTING A FRESH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE HAS NO CONNECTION TO WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THE BLOOD OF JESUS WILL DO. GOD, he's not interested in our excuses. &gt;&gt; Oh, I I was born with this disability. I was born I couldn't speak right. My eyes I don't see right. That's what Moses tried to do. &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I I can't speak." He says, "Well, I'LL BE WITH YOU." "WELL, I CAN'T DO THIS. I CAN'T." BUT WE EXCUSES, EXCUSES, EXCUSES. AND BROTHER SAYS, "GOD DOESN'T NEED OUR EXCUSES, NOR DOES HE NEED OUR ABILITY." WHAT GOD IS LOOKING FOR IS A WILLING VESSEL. I DON'T I I I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY, BUT I'LL GO. I DON'T HAVE THE CAPABILITY, BUT I'LL GO. LET ME SAY THIS. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GO TO HEAVEN BY OUR ABILITY. WE'RE GOING TO GO BECAUSE HE SAID WE'LL GO. &gt;&gt; WHAT WHAT WE NEED IS TO TAKE THE WORD OF GOD. I WAS THINKING ABOUT JOSHUA AND CALEB, BUT MADAM SAYS THEY DIDN'T LOOK AT THE OBSTACLE, THEY LOOKED AT THE PROMISE. WHAT THE PROMISE SAID IT WAS, BUT WHAT THEY WERE BELIEVING. SO IF THE PROMISE SAYS I'M WELL, I DON'T CARE WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; What is God doing? He's making a way for you to go back to what you were in the beginning. HE'S MAKING A WAY. NOT YOU. HE'S MAKING THE WAY. &gt;&gt; Justified as though you never done it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So on Calvary, the scripture will say that he tore the vessel, he tore the veil from top to bottom, signifying that his presence will no longer be hidden from the believer. &gt;&gt; He made himself known &gt;&gt; who he was. He, you know, first it was just the priest that saw him. It was only the priest that went in a holy of holy. and the priest will go and everybody else will just have to wait to wait and see what happens. ANDAM SAYS IT WAS DEATH TO GO IN THERE BECAUSE ONLY THE PRIEST COULD GO. BUT WHEN THE VEIL WAS TORN, WHEN GOD MADE A WAY TO NOT GO IN THERE BECAME DEATH. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? TO NOT HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BECAME DEATH. TO NOT BE CONNECTED WITH HIM BECAME DEATH. WHY? OUTSIDE IS JUST A RELIGIOUS SPIRIT. IT'S JUST A RELIGIOUS CEREMONY. WHAT HE'S WANTING FOR IS THE ONENESS TO BE RECREATED THAT was back in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Jesus became sin &gt;&gt; so we can take his righteousness. &gt;&gt; The cross, let me say this, the cross didn't give you a new position. The cross came to tell you or to expose to you what you were really before the sin came. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Everything in between what happened from uh uh uh from in the garden of Eden until Christ came. When Christ came, he was only there because remember the scripture says he was the firstborn among many brethren. He was coming to establish a way back for the believer into the presence of God for the fellowship. I was thinking this morning I thought about Peter, James and John. And in fact Peter and John Yeah. were the church. If you look at the format of the church, they came and they they they they would every time the scripture will say one will come that was sick, they will even take it before Christ so he could be prayed for. But after the day of Pentecost, but when it makes a statement someplace, it said now the man that was at the gate beautiful Jesus perhaps passed there many time and saw him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; Jesus passed there many times and he saw that man at the gate beautiful, he did nothing. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he knew that AFTER THE DAY OF PENTECOST, WHAT DID THE DAY OF PENTECOST COME TO DO? THE DAY OF PENTECOST COME TO SHOW THE THE the believers or the disciples WHAT THEY REALLY WERE AT THE BEGINNING BEFORE ALL OF THAT HAPPENED. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT WHEN PETER AND JOHN CAME TO THE GATE BEAUTIFUL, WHEN THEY LOOKED AT THE MAN, THEY SAY UNTO HIM, "SILVER AND GOLD HAVE I NONE, BUT THAT WHICH I HAVE." WHY DID THEY HAVE? IT'S THE RECOGNITION THAT THEY WERE SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. THEY CAME INTO THE REALIZATION THAT THEY WERE JUST NOT MORTAL. THEY WERE JUST NOT FISHERMEN. THEY WERE NOT THOSE THAT JESUS CALLED SOMEWHERE ON THE COURSE. THERE WERE THOSE THAT WERE PREDESTINATED AT THAT MOMENT TO SPEAK THE WORD SO THE MAN CAN STAND UP. &gt;&gt; OH, IF WE CAN RECEIVE THAT REVELATION THIS MORNING, YOU'RE NOT JUST A DOCTOR [screaming] OR OR AN ENGINEER OR WAREHOUSE WORKER, WHATEVER YOU ARE, WHAT YOU ARE, YOU ARE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD FOR YOU TO EXPRESS GOD TO THIS TIME GENERATION. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; What says Christ the mystery of God revealed paragraph 233 [snorts] it says look &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; He says paragraph 233 he says look Christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; See Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation of Christ in the Bible. It says makes him the center of the revelation. CHRIST IN YOU. CHRIST IN THE BIBLE makes the Bible a complete revelation of Christ. Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the WHOLE THING. WHAT GOD IS TRYING YOU SEE SEE WHAT GOD IS TRYING to do. He says THE WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH THEN YOU WOULD SAY BROTHER BRANDHAM WHAT IS THE NEW BIRTH IS THE REVELATION OF JESUS CHRIST PERSONALLY TO YOU. AMEN. IT SAYS NOT YOU JOINING A CHURCH OR YOU SHOOK HAND OR YOU DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT. YOU SAID A CREED or or or you you promised to LIVE ACCORD. BUT CHRIST, THE BIBLE, HE IS THE WORD. HE IS THE WORD THAT WAS REVEALED TO YOU. AND NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS, WHAT TAKES PLACE, IT'S CHRIST, PASTOR, PRIEST, WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE, IT'S CHRIST IN YOU THAT THE REVELATION. IT SAYS THAT IS THE REVELATION that the church will be was built upon. All right. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. The revelation that the church is built upon, give me a second. The revelation, the revelation that the church is built upon is God. And I'm saying this not by intellect, but by revelation &gt;&gt; making himself known to each individual. &gt;&gt; Amen. So you can act to what you were in the beginning before there was an atom, before there was a molecule, before there was anything. But when I'm says, "Oh, we need revelation by the spirit. We don't need a new Bible. We don't need a New Testament. Though some are very good. I'm not against that. But we need the revelation of the spirit. And thank God that we can have what we need. For God wants to reveal his word to us by his spirit. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You caught this. It's the revelation by the spirit. It's not you reading the Bible and seeing it in a way you never see it before. BUT IT TAKES THE SPIRIT OF GOD TO COME TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND DWELL IN YOU AND CAUSE YOU TO SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME THIS MORNING? IT TAKES THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY SPIRIT ON THE PERSON ON THE SOUL TO CHANGE YOUR NATURE FROM WHATEVER YOU WERE FOREVER THE FOR WHATEVER THE THINGS OF THE WORLD YOU WENT AFTER INTO SOMEBODY NEW THAT LOVES [screaming] AND LIVES FOR THE THINGS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS WHAT HE SAYS MAY UH UH MAY GOD MAY GOD BY HIS SPIRIT give us CONTINUAL LIFEGIVING and prevailing revelation. Oh, if the church only gets a a fresh revelation and and become by it the living word manifested, &gt;&gt; we would do greater works and glorify our God the father &gt;&gt; in heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But one says Jesus looked at he came it says in John 17 it says father that the glory which I had with you in the beginning that they may have the same glory. Jesus didn't want you to be lower than him. &gt;&gt; Are you with me this morning? Jesus didn't ask that you may have some other places lower level UH NOT MEANINGFUL PLACE THAT you can occupy but yet be a Christian &gt;&gt; because that's WHAT WE DO &gt;&gt; THAT'S what that's the the image we create for ourselves he said BUT IN FACT SAYS IN THAT DAY YOU SHALL KNOW TALKING ABOUT THIS TODAY HE SAYS THAT THE SAME WAY THE FATHER WAS IN ME THAT I WILL ALSO BE IN YOU. WHAT JESUS WAS ASKING FOR THAT IF I LAY DOWN MY LIFE IN JOHN 17 THAT THE SAME FRIENDSHIP THAT THE SAME FELLOWSHIP THAT HE HAD WITH THE FATHER THAT YOU CAN BE PARTAKERS OF THAT SAME revelation that YOU CAN BE PARTAKERS OF THAT SAME LIFE. NOT SOME THIRD PARTY SOMEWHERE BUT YOU CAN BE JUST AS HE WAS HERE ON EARTH. THAT we the prophet will say God's great mystery. What the eternal God had a mystery and been unfolding in Jesus Christ then given right down to his church. What was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Listen to this. Jesus making love to his church, his bride, whispering secrets to her. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. You can't get greater than that. Right. &gt;&gt; See, we I feel like the the the devil is got us exactly the same place that Eve was. &gt;&gt; Oh, I if you can do this, &gt;&gt; you can be EVEN LIKE GOD. THEY WERE ALREADY GOD. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THEY WERE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. THEY WERE THE SPIRIT OF GOD. THEY WERE ALREADY GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT YET WE COME TO CHURCH, WE FEEL LIKE, "OH, IF I COULD JUST GET MORE." NO, YOU DON'T NEED MORE. YOU NEED A REVELATION OF WHAT YOU ALREADY GIVEN TO YOU. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ENEMY. IT'S HIS APPROACH. HE TRIES TO COME [screaming] AND AND SHOW, OH, I'M BLESSED IF I CAN ONLY BE LIKE GOD. YOU ARE LIKE GOD. YOU WERE MADE IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. IN FACT, HE'S COMING HERE TO LET YOU KNOW. BUT WHEN SAYS, "OH, WHAT WE NEED THIS MORNING IS THAT OUR CHARACTERS, [clears throat] LISTEN TO THIS, THE WORD OF GOD HAS BEEN GIVEN TO US TO MOLD OUR CHARACTER SO IT WILL MATCH WHAT WAS IN THE BEGINNING. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; THE WORD IS GIVEN FOR THE MOLDING OF YOUR CHARACTER. SO IF THE WORD SAYS YOU CAN'T DO THIS, YOU CAN'T DO THAT, OFTEN TIME WE LOOK AT IT AS RESTRICTION." NO, IT'S GIVEN TO YOU BECAUSE THE WORD IS GIVEN AND THE WORD HAS THE CHARGE OF MAKING SURE THAT IT MOLDS YOU SO YOU CAN BE IN THE IMAGE THAT WILL FIT WHAT WAS IN THE BEGINNING. AND TO REJECT THE WORD IS TO REJECT THE IMAGE. &gt;&gt; And the only way we can know what already existed is by his word making manifest to us. We are invited to shape our character by his word in the message identification by his grace. If we are invited to think of it to become characters like his. If we are if we are ready to lay our characters down and the molding and the molding that that we had and howy it says heady and high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, false accusers and incontinent and despise of those who are trying to do right and having the form of godliness and denying the power thereof. How can God come in the place like that when they deny the word when we watched over his word? And it says when he watched over his word to vindicate it and make it come to pass and the word is pushed out, how can he identify himself with something like that? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? And why is he saying that? He's not saying that to condemn you. He's saying that to identify you. Why? Because he knows only the elect can really receive the word. &gt;&gt; See, when we read this, the flesh feels that condemnation, but the spirit says, "This is what I want." That's why I said the other day, when the word is preached, we have to be careful that we don't apply it to the flesh, BUT WE LET THE word speak to the spirit man so the spirit man can o can take the word and overcome the flesh man. SO WHEN HE'S SAYING THIS, THEY WERE DENYING THE WORD. HE'S IDENTIFYING A characteristics of PEOPLE BECAUSE HE SAID ONLY THE ELECT WILL RECEIVE the word. SO WHEN THE WORD IS PREACHED, THE ELECT, NO MATTER HOW HARD OR NO MATTER HOW THE WORD COME, THE ELECT IS THERE TO RECEIVE THE WORD BECAUSE THE ELECT KNOWS THAT BY THY WORD I'LL BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE THINGS THAT HE SAYS. &gt;&gt; AND LET ME SAY THIS MORNING, ONLY the elect can manifest the true characteristics and expression of Christ. You say how? Only the elect can have true love, &gt;&gt; true forgiveness. &gt;&gt; True healing, true everything. Because the unbeliever will do it when he knows he benefits him. &gt;&gt; You You see, the unbeliever's got a motive. But the true elect, it's not him. It's the reflection of what's inside of his heart. THE TRUE ELECT DOESN'T HOLD GRUDGES OR OR OR MAD AT SOMEBODY OR DO SOME NO, THE TRUE ELECT KNOWS THAT THE SAME LOVE BECAUSE REMEMBER JESUS IS NOT ASKING US TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WAS OFFERED TO US. WHY? IT'S THE SAME LIFE THAT WAS IN CHRIST WHEN HE DWELLS IN YOU WHEN HE WAS PERSECUTED WHEN HE WAS TAKEN TO THE CROSS WHEN HE WAS BEING BEATEN. HE LOOKED AT THEM AND he says, "Father, forgive them. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if it's not the true elect, &gt;&gt; it will try to find a reason to hate, &gt;&gt; a reason to criticize, a reason to hold grudges, a reason to say this or to say that. But the true elect is the true reflection of who Christ is. &gt;&gt; He made us partakers of divine nature. When the Holy Ghost comes in you, IT'S JUST NOT to give you uh some emotional EXCITEMENT, ALTHOUGH WE MAY HAVE THAT, but it was to make us partakers of divine nature to BRING US TO THE VERY LIFE of Christ in the human vessel. &gt;&gt; Why the human vessel? Because that's where the expression will take place. And let me add this. The expression cannot take place when everything is calm and dandy. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; Just like the creation in the building in the beginning. The expression needs to be where there's turbulence. &gt;&gt; You with me? There need to be some condition &gt;&gt; by which the expression will be made. &gt;&gt; Oh my, &gt;&gt; how we hate that environment. &gt;&gt; How we run from that environment. &gt;&gt; See, we think being a Christian is being peaceful and you know having yoga in the morning and nothing is going wrong, &gt;&gt; right? Like I'll just wake up and just whistle my way from the morning and everything will be fine. But Ram says, "Get that image out of your mind. &gt;&gt; Being a Christian is a battleground. &gt;&gt; Is conquering and putting under subjection. Is calling things that are not as though there were. IS CALLING THINGS THAT ARE ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S THE EXPRESSION. &gt;&gt; DON'T RUN AWAY FROM THE EXPRESSION. GOD YOUR [screaming] FATHER DIDN'T RUN AWAY FROM THE EXPRESSION. HOW CAN YOU THE SON RUN AWAY FROM EXPRESSION? &gt;&gt; IF HE MADE THE EXPRESSION A REALITY, LET ME SAY THIS THIS MORNING. YOU WILL MAKE THE EXPRESSION A REALITY. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE IT IN YOUR TROUBLES, &gt;&gt; IN YOUR TRIALS, IN THE PLACES THAT YOU ARE WITH ALL THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING YOU? LET ME SAY THIS. GOD KNEW ABOUT THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES AND HE KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T GIVE YOU UNLESS HE KNEW THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO HANDLE THEM. &gt;&gt; The expression HAS GOT TO COME OUT. &gt;&gt; BUT THE EXPRESSION SAYS IT'S LIKE GOLD. YOU DON'T JUST TAKE GOLD OUT OF THE GROUND AND SAY, "OH, LOOK." IN FACT, IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT looks nothing like what you see. It has to go through the process of refining. &gt;&gt; It has to go through the process of beating out all the fool's gold. And but when says it's beaten UNTIL THE IMAGE OF THE ONE THAT'S DOING THE beating can see his own reflection. My brother, MY SISTER, THE TRIALS THAT UPON YOU, IT'S NOT BECAUSE GOD HATES YOU. GOD KNOWS THAT IN YOUR FLESH THERE'S AN IMAGE OF HIM THAT HE PLACED IN THERE. [screaming] ALL THAT HE'S TRYING TO DO THIS MORNING IS TO BEAT THE FLESH OUT OF YOU SO HE CAN LIVE THE IMAGE THAT'S HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; THE IMAGE OF HIMSELF. OH MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, LET YOUR HEART SCREAM OUT THIS MORNING AND SAY, GOD, I WANT YOUR IMAGE TO COME OUT. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOUR [screaming] IMAGE TO COME OUT. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE TALKS ABOUT THE BADGE OF SKIN. THE BADGER SKIN COULD NOT BE USED UNTIL IT WAS DRIED OUT, ALL THE LIFE TAKEN OFF OF IT for it to express or to cover the glory that was in the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; See, what we want is a little mixing of the life of God with our flesh. The flesh wants to be part of it so we can say, "See, see what I did? God, God used me. and and he healed this and he did this and then we take a little bit of that glory. God is not going to share his glory with nobody. God can use a donkey. God can TAKE THE STONE AND TURN THEM INTO CHILDREN OF ABRAHAM. WHAT WE NEED IS TO BE WILLING VESSEL WHEREVER HE WANTS, HOWEVER HE CHOOSES. He says in the spoken word is the original state. I'm coming to a close. He says paragraph uh 388 it says now the power of the believing church. I love this. The power of the believing church. Christ has all the power in heaven and earth. You believe that? The congregation say amen. &gt;&gt; It says now if if is in you has Christ got all power. Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew 18 uh 28 and and 18 he says all right he is the seedword in his body. He says, "And he is in us becomes the seedword in us." WHAT ALL THE POWER, ALL THAT GOD WAS, he poured into Christ. AND ALL THAT CHRIST WAS, he poured into the church. That's the power. He continues on. It says, "NOW WATCH. REMEMBER GOD'S LAW OF REPRODUCTION." Now remember after his kind, right? The congregation say, "Amen. The seed of it says THE SEED OF CHRIST, THE WORD MUST COME THROUGH HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; DID YOU CATCH THAT? &gt;&gt; THE POWER OF GOD MUST BE MANIFESTED in his body. YOU YOU YOU CAN'T THE THE WHATEVER THE HEAD IS, THE BODY IS ALSO. IT'S NOT THAT THE POWER IS IN THE HEAD, BUT YET THE BODY IS NOTHING. WHEN THE BODY IS CONNECTED TO THE HEAD, WHAT THE HEAD IS, THE BODY IS THE MATERIAL THAT THE HEAD IS MADE OF, THE BODY IS MADE OUT OF THE SAME MATERIAL. THE SAME POWER THAT WAS IN CHRIST, THAT SAME POWER IS IN HIS BODY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT SAYS, NOW NOTICE, UH, notice it says, and this is Christ got to reveal. I'm back over there. HE SAYS, "NOW NOTICE GOD MAKING HIMSELF KNOWN. WE are supposed to be uh we are not supposed to be TO MAKE CONVERTS TO CHRIST BY government by by revelation. Christ in you AS GOD WAS IN CHRIST. AS GOD WAS IN CHRIST, CHRIST IS IN YOU." WHEN GOD WHAT GOD DID IN CHRIST, CHRIST does in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Same thing. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "WHAT SIGNS GOD DID IN CHRIST, CHRIST DOES IN YOU." ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL? MY JESUS SAYS, HE SAID, "AT THAT DAY," IT SAYS THAT'S THIS DAY. AT THAT DAY WHEN THIS revelation is made known. &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to catch that. [snorts] When this revelation is made known, you will know that I am in the father and the father in me and I in you. In other word, what is the revealing of the seals? The barbanam says the seals is Christ. What is it? It's revealing Christ. So at the revealing of who Christ is, we have come to the understanding that we are in him and he's in us at that very revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Christ and the bride are the same thing. &gt;&gt; In fact, we've come to an understanding that his revelation at the end time is him being revealed in his bride's body. That's the revelation of this hour. If the musician could come, [snorts] the scripture will speak in 2 Corinthians 16. It says, "What agreement has the temple of God with idols? Ye are not. You are the temple of the living God. As God has said, I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Ram makes a statement. He says, "When a man builds a house, he intends to live in it." &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; So God didn't create you &gt;&gt; so you can remain an empty vessel &gt;&gt; or some kind of vessel that the enemy will push and do whatever they want. God made you for the purpose of fellowship that he can come and dwell in you and you will have fellowship with him. &gt;&gt; God wants to see another God. He doesn't want to see your flesh. He paid for your flesh. He killed your flesh. He took it away. Don't keep bringing it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; You look at yourself in the mirror of the word and look at what he said about you and you dressed in that word and you present himself before him and he will accept you. &gt;&gt; But what I'm say I'll just say this to in closing. He says the bride is the final this is me saying is the final expression of God's work on earth. Just the same way as Adam was the completion of the creation at the beginning after the sixth day God came and he created one that looked like him. At the end of seven CHURCH AGES WHEN ALL OF THEM IS done God comes at the end and he creates a bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah &gt;&gt; that's exactly like himself. So the completion of the fullness of the manifestation of his PURPOSE IN HER GOD find rest in her. She's the final of the She's the finality of the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. We're not called to be beggars. &gt;&gt; Oh God, if you can. That's not how God wants you to approach him this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that happened with a woman because she came out of season and she approached him as he was the son of David. He came to the Jews. [music] But yet when she called Lord, he recognized that he was Lord over all and he answered to the need. But we live in the time where he's come as the bridegroom to us. And I think it would be a lacking on our part if we try to approach him differently from the way he wants us to approach him. I think it will be a miss from our side to come this morning look at oursel treat oursel and think of ourselves less from what he said we are. So we are we are here as possessors of the eternal life. We are here as possessors of what belongs to to possess what belong to us to take hold of the promises of God. We are here TO BRING WHAT GOD TO COME AND TO contribute to BE PART OF WHAT GOD HAS CALLED US TO be in the end time. We are HERE TO BE GOD'S BADGE OF SKIN FOR THE WORLD that we are living in. &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS. IT SHOULDN'T BE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE to look at you and see Christ. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; I I I'll tell you just a a short story, just a I I was not even a preacher and I was I was probably in my 20s, 24, [music] 25. I at work a guy looks at me just looks at me asked me, "Are you a preacher?" I said no. And and that was not even the first time I I was a young person. I've told it before I came and I there's a a pastor who was a a neighbor and every morning they will come and collect all the kids and you know take him to church forcefully. You know you know when he show up we we have no way to run. SO WE KNEW WHAT time it will come and we'll run away and and and and then so he kind of understood what was happening and he will show UP AT VERY ODD HOURS BEFORE WE COULD get ready to run and and HE TOOK US TO CHURCH AND WE'RE SITTING THERE DON'T WANT TO BE there nothing want to be there he called me to come and close the prayer and I pray and and he looked at me he says do you feel you HAVE A CALLED TO PREACH. I said I and I'm thinking this guy just wants me to be in this building FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; NOT INTERESTED. AND AND WHAT AM I SAYING THIS MORNING? BEFORE WHEN [screaming] YOU WERE EVEN A SINNER, &gt;&gt; BEFORE WHEN YOU EVEN DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT YOURSELF, &gt;&gt; THE SEED WAS ALREADY SCREAMING OUT OF YOU WITHOUT EVEN YOU KNOWING. &gt;&gt; BEFORE WHEN YOU WERE DOWN IN SIN AND THE M AND EVERYTHING. BEFORE YOU WERE EVEN KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT GOD, THAT SEED WAS ALREADY MANIFESTED AND THERE WERE SOME THAT COULD SEE IT. MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, IF BACK THEN IT WAS THAT WAY. HOW MUCH MORE THIS MORNING? HOW MUCH MORE WHEN WE'VE GIVEN HIM OUR ALL WHEN WE HEAR WANTING HIM TO SPEAK TO US? HOW MUCH MORE THIS MORNING? HE WANTS TO LIFT you up and make you to be his image, his reflection for the dying generation. Let me say this. It's not something that you make yourself be. It's what he has already made you to be. &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS. LET'S KICK AWAY UNBELIEF. LET'S KICK AWAY THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. LET'S KICK AWAY ALL THE THINGS THAT'S COMING ON OUR WAY. LET'S SEPARATE OURSELVES FROM THE THINGS OF THE WORLD. LET'S SEPARATE OURSEL FROM THE TELEVISION AND ENTERTAINMENT AND ALL THE THINGS THAT TAKES US AWAY FROM IT. LET'S EMBRACE THIS REVELATION. LET TAKE THIS REVELATION. MY BROTHER, MY SISTER, IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHAT THE WORD CAN DO, RECEIVE THE WORD OF GOD THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; DON'T RECEIVE IT PARTIALLY. EMBRACE IT FULLY. GIVE IT YOUR ALL AND SEE WHAT GOD could produce in you. &gt;&gt; HE'S ALREADY MADE IT. &gt;&gt; He's just here to make you realize that he's already done it for you. &gt;&gt; Let's stand this morning. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation OF CHRIST. CHRIST in you. It's the whole picture this morning. &gt;&gt; It's not something new, but it's him making himself known to his believers. I don't know about you, but my heart's desire is, Father, oh, if I could just die to myself this morning. Father, if you could just help me die to myself and the things of the world. Father, you said that we need revelation more than ever before. That we may grow into this realization every day, Lord, that we may never I know we it's a battle, but Lord, that can we can you help us this morning, Father, that we may look at ourselves in the light of what you've called us to be, Lord. Father, that we may use that to overcome and fight the enemy that we fight every day with. To know that it's Christ in me, the hope of glory. To know that I'm here as THE EXPRESSION. IF GOD DIDN'T FAIL, THE EXPRESSION in the beginning, if the expression in Christ never fail, if the expression in Moses never fail, if the expression in David didn't fail, the expression in the bride in the end time cannot fail. Why? BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME GOD BRINGING the expression all the time. Help us, Lord. Lead us, oh Father. Guide us and forgive our shortcomings which are many. Lord, renew our mind and the mind that was in Christ may be in us this morning. We commit everything that we are. Lord, if there be any need represented in the body, Lord, I know there isn't. We remember father those that are sick and father sister Lori husband we pray that lord you continue to raise him up and father give him strength and [snorts] fast to recovery Lord and those needs that we read [music] in the building and father the little boy in Brazil and all of those father we lift them up this morning anybody in this building father that's sick lord your prophet said one place that all we need to do is recognize that Christ is in us and he that is in us is greater than he that is in the world. We lift our hands and say that Christ in us is greater than our sickness. Christ in us is greater than the demons that's tormenting us. Christ in us is greater than anything. And that Christ in us will overcome for us. Will you come this morning, Lord, and and just touch our bodies, Lord, and Father, [snorts] give us what we have need of. Help us, Lord, where we are weak, that we may be strong. We [music] commit everything that we are, Lord. And thank you, Father. We ask this in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. [snorts] Amen. Let's just sing [music] that at this time. Gift of [singing] grace is Jesus mine. There is no [music] my [music] rightous [music] my deepen.

Once again, we want to remember our meetings are coming up this coming week. We would like to have you all come out. [music] If we can get everybody with expectation, we could have a service even greater than this one. [music] But in a moment like this, because we may not get to the meetings, but we do have right now. So if you feel something tugging on your heart from what was preached [music] and you need prayer, you can come up for prayer right there where you're at. You can give of yourself to him. [music] He cares. He cares. But if we get there to that next week, it'd be awesome to get everybody there. We'll ask brother Tim to come and close our service in a [music] word of prayer. Amen. Appreciate that this morning. Wasn't [music] just a sprinkling. That was a total immersion. Amen. Very appreciative. You know, this is the greatest love story that's ever been written. &gt;&gt; And what I heard this morning is that you and I are the principal characters. &gt;&gt; The author himself is not the principal character. He's the one who wrote the book. Amen. &gt;&gt; The book of Revelation says, "Behold, I come quickly and my reward is with me." &gt;&gt; We are his reward. Let's bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father, we thank you, Lord Jesus, that you've called us your own. Lord, you've come and identified us. Lord, you've given us evidence of it. Lord, may the truths that we've heard this morning, Lord, sink deep within us. May we realize Lord that it's manifesting time and Lord there's a change that's being wrought Lord maybe not in this outward flesh but Lord there's the inner man that's being strengthened day by day we pray Lord you continue to draw us closer to you Lord as we set about this afternoon may these words just stir us up Lord may we dwell on them Lord may they become part of us for it's the very truth that converts us into your righteousness us. Lord, Lord, grant the requests, the needs, Lord, even now as we leave this building. Lord, may your hand of mercy be extended upon each one of us. Give us traveling mercies. May we gather again at the appointed time this afternoon. And Lord, we look to you to fulfill all things in your word. [music] Grant it to our hearts now as we ask these things in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's sing this [music] as we are dismissed. There is a source [music and singing] in times of need that brings me [music] hope, [singing] that brings me [music] peace. In every trial, through [music] every [singing] test, my savior stands [music and singing] in my defense. So when [music and singing] the road you walk leaves you tired, [singing] [music] your strength is gone and your heart feels [music] so God [music] is ger. [singing] The battle is over. And when the waters rise, [music] he [singing] calls my hand. When you miss me, you come [music] out on the way and my head [music] last and [music and singing] makes me stand out on the water. So when the road [singing] you walk you tire [music] is strong and your heart feels full. Remember God [music] is [singing] great. Take courage [music] for the battle is. So when the road you walk [music] So when the road you walk [music] and your heart [music] is full of God [music] is [singing] ger things. Take courage [music] for the battle is the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [music]
