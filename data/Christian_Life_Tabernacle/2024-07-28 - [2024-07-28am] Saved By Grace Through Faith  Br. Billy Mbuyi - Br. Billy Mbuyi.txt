sister Linda bring hers God bless you Church um sorry be with me just two minutes there's a little testimony to uh um to my special uh uh I don't know where to start from uh but first of all I want to like to thank the church uh for your messages the condolences for my father-in-law that passed couple weeks ago U got us into a place where we've never experienced that before I stay had my parents my wife stay had a parents at that time so it's the first time that something got so closed like that uh and while we were still grieving and still finding a way to say how do we how do we take ourself down home and you know uh it's a lot uh the devil decided to pick up extra shift uh and just kind of Torment us and just uh bring pain and you know compounding the old old e and um and I'll start with this just two part to it uh last week um I usually wake up very early in the morning for the past couple months just so I can get on the road and just run um been doing that since I was in the military and I wanted to get back to it for health reasons and so I wake up in the morning very early I get on the road and run and you know I would always keep the right lane like they would say keep face your coming vehicle I think I've been hearing that since I was a little kid and so I'll face my coming vehicle and just take some lap uh couple times in a week five miles sometimes times and then but this particular day I was like well I've been telling my wife I wanted to make sure it's 10 miles so I went and I did 10 miles and when I'm coming home I usually pick up the pace and I will stay on my right hand side until I get home but then on this particular day I think it was a Friday I kept on staying on my right hand side I mean left hand side rather facing the coming vehicle and then I made a switch I was couple blocks away from home and I made it which it was weird because I had to cross the roads to get on the other side of the road and I've never done that before I've always kept on my left and so suddenly I just crossed I was so tired that the cars that were even trying to exit the neighborhood were looking at me like if you still going that way why do you have to cross right in front of me to make that exit but I just kept on going and then all of a sudden um I just looked back and I heard this noise you know when the car is kind of like skied on the road and I just heard this sound and it just veered to the left which if I was on the other side of the road I would be exactly on that spot and this car knocked the whole you know the mailbox this concrete mailbox it knocked it off knocked some pose and then went on top of a car and just stood on top of a truck um and you know the neighbors just came outside and I just stood there and I was just looking I was just laughing I was like God you're so good cuz you made me just cross that place just not long ago and I was so exhausted I was just like thank God and um for if I say fortunately unfortunately the lady was a nurse just got out the car I was like you okay she said she's fine I think she had some problems with her wrist and you know I was just praying I was just like God you know my wife is a nurse as well she's probably coming back from work and I just kept on praying and um they came and they fixed it I just went home and I just sprayed um and I was like okay that's good um but all of a sudden my wife was coming back from work not that day couple days after that my wife was driving down from walk as well coming home and all of a sudden I just heard a call from my sister-in-law and say hey call your wife I was like what's the problem call my wife like and I picked up the phone called her she wouldn't pick up I was scared I quickly look on the app I saw where the car is actually located she was like I think she got into a wreck and because I could locate where the car was which wasn't far from here I drove all the way down from home and got there and um the car was completely wrecked and um and my wife came out of the car and scratched um and I was just so thankful to God to say Oh Lord You're so grateful um the car you would say the this person came out of this car and scratch if you actually look at the car uh the head back nothing deployed and I went home and me and my wife you know we started talking about okay the car is gone okay the car is gone I was like well we have life thank God the car is gone and then I was like why didn't the hairbag deployed you know I started pondering so much like the hair nothing deployed cuz the inside was intact but the whole outside is gone and something just told me and then I started doing my research I I know you know the force of what the airbag could be as well even if it deployed and something was like well I don't think your wife could take hairbag if it deployed because it's also it could also be very damaging and I just thank God I woke up a couple days after that I just started crying to say God if I haven't been thankful enough I'm just thankful I'm just grateful and I wanted to use this opportunity to come here not for anything but to say I'm grateful to God that uh when the enemy you know comes like a flood of many Waters the Bible says that you know God will always raise a standard and I think that's a standard that God has raised for all in my family so I'm really really grateful and I just have this short song it says uh thy loveing kindness is better than life uh thy loveing kindness is better than life thy loveing kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thust will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name I lift my hands up onto thy name I lift my hands up onto thy name my lips shall praise thee just will I bless Thee I will lift up my hands unto thy name his loving

enlist in the [Music] military I didn't take much time to think on it but I just felt led to do it I did three years in the army and afterwards I went out before leaving the Army I didn't know what I was doing at that moment so I decided to get a certification to be a technician yeah I did that for about a year and a half I had to go back to the university because I hadn't yet finished okay fix so this this work of technician that I was doing I was traveling a lot and I needed to get into a fixed job uh where I could study like uh where I could focus on studying okay at that point I was looking for work everywhere up and down searching a job that allows me to focus on my studies there was work that that was there that I was just I prayed for and I applied a uh I wasn't qualified for that job because I didn't have any experience in that job I just applied I went to that place there was an interview there I did the interview they told me to take a test on the laptop I didn't even study I just went over there and took the test I just did the test just to do it I [Music] was couple weeks [Music] later I received the call saying that I passed the test and they wanted to give me the job I wasn't even qualified for the job it's an industry in which I'm not qualified in manufacturer industrial another job of technician but more so on the industrial side everything that I needed to know and learn about what to do for that job I learned on the job a couple months ago I decided that I wanted to get married entering into marriage I wasn't yet finished with my studies [Music] and I was uh also going to school I'm studying engineering so while I'm in school for engineering I'm looking for an engineering job I didn't even finish at the same time I'm getting married I had three months to decide what I was going to do so at that time she was my fiance but now we're [Music] married while we were on the phone discussing and talking about what to [Music] do we finished talking on the phone just then internship I receive a a call for an internship they asked me to go to Denver for an internship for a work for engineering I don't remember ever applying or looking for that internship while I was looking for work but while that time after I was done speaking with my wife on the phone of what to do next I received the call to go over there and so I went during that time when I went to to that job I still had my job that I was unqualified for in that moment I was deciding what to do I got three months that I'm going to get married and at the same time I want to buy a house I'm going to school all these things in the same period of time he was calculating in his head how is this how can I make this possible at the same time I'm praying I spoke to my job in which I wasn't qualified for I asked them if they could give me the opportunity to go and do that internship for three months [Music] the goal was for me to during that time to get that job at that place [Music] yeah didn't want me to come come back they asked I had to stop the job that I wasn't qualified for in order for me to go over to to [Music] Denver that point I didn't know if they were going to give me that job while I'm trying to get married okay hey for the Moment by the grace of God I knew that I was going to have that job so I I give Grace to glory to the Lord knowing that I had yet to finish my studies to have that job you have to finish your studies [Music] last week uh that manager over there at the job told me that they were going to let me know and give me an offer what was crazy was that that Monday there I was told that that manager was sent somewhere else I was in trouble I didn't know what to do but since they already told me they were going to give me an offer I I had prayed to the Lord something spoke to my heart not to worry for the time being they gave me an offer while I'm still in school I want to thank the Lord for all that he has done for me and his [Music] grace all I can say is truly just to trust in the Lord in in those moments where times get hard and they keep getting hard but spiritually Things become deeper on the other side of the spiritual as though we see in the Physical Realm things get harder but the Lord brings us into a different path spiritually with him so I just want to say grace to the Lord and thank him for all he's done in my life amen I love testimonies like that the Lord will give his child an unqualified job you know that's that's that's spiritual you know the the prophet of God would teach us that God doesn't call the equipped

with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ amen aren't you glad to be blessed this morning it says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world it says that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love it says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Christ Jes by Jesus Christ to him according to the good pleasure of his will I want to just point out to you so on forth it says according to his chosen us he has chosen us so the choosing is his choosing to begin with chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love chosen for a purpose so he's chosen us why does he choose us why am I chosen why did God call me what is the purpose of him calling that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us to what just so we can say we are Christian no just so we can claim oh praise God I'm saved no predestinated as unto the adoption of children by Christ Jesus uh by by Jesus Christ to him according to the good pleasure of his will to the praises to the praise of his glory to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood and the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace wherein he had abound abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made un known unto us the Mysteries the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he had purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time that he may gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained The Inheritance being predestinated according to the person purpose of him who had who had worked all things after the councel of his own will that we should be to the Praises of his glory uh who first trusted in Christ in whom he also trusted after that he had heard the word of Truth The Gospel of your salvation in whom also after ye believed ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise let's just bow our heads our gracious father we ask that you bless your word to us this morning we're commit it to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats and as you are seated you can turn your Bibles also in 1 Peter chapter 1 we're going to read verse 10 we're going to read uh let's read from let's start from verse 9 it says that receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your soul of which salvation the prophet have inquired and search diligently who prophesied of the grace that should come unto you searching what or what manner of time the spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when he testify beforehand the suffering of Christ and the glory that should follow it says unto whom it was revealed that that unto them themselves but unto us did they Minister the things which which are now reported unto you by them that were preached the gospel unto you that the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which things the angel desired to look to look into wherefore G up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end of the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ Ephesians chapter 2 I'll just read verse four it says but God who rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin had quickened us together in Christ by Grace ye are saved and has raised it up rais us up together and made it seat in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come that he might show the exceeding reach of his grace reaches of his grace in his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus but for by Grace ye are saved through faith not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of your Works lest any many should let less any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in in Christ Jesus unto good works which God had before ordained that we should walk in them I just want to uh take a few moment this morning and I want to speak on saved by grace through faith Sav by grace through faith so as we just read the scriptures this morning we we can certainly within our own selves and within our lives we can understand we we are so thankful to be gathered here this morning and we understand it can only be possible by the grace of God we we understand that if we we we breathe if we are alive if we are in good health if anything good ever happens to us if we are to be Christians this morning if we are able to see the word the revealed word of our time if we are able to see anything at all it's by the grace of God because the scripture tells us that any good and perfect things come from the father above we understand it's the grace of God that called you out of sin it's the grace of God that made you see this message that we believe it's the grace of God that made a way for you to be called a son and the daughter of God it's the grace of God that makes us what we are it's not not our effort it's not our ability it's not one cannot stand and say oh I'm strong enough to have believed this I I study this enough that's why I see it we understand that it's by the grace of God so as we read the scripture here this morning in Ephesians 2 it will say that uh that he had he and you had he quickened who were dead in sin and trespass in trespassing sin so we can understand this morning by the word of by the word of God that one time we were called the children of disobedient we were in sin walking after the last of our flesh and doing the things the same way the world will do we were in bars we were in clubs and we were on the church pew we were everywhere we were we were the children of this we were with the children of disobedient but God who's rich in Mercy he came by his great love and he spoke to us and he spoke to us what what made the change was God grace was extended unto us it wasn't because we were the brightest it wasn't because we were the best that there was in fact I want to say this this morning between us that are sit here in this church and the person outside the only difference is the grace of God it's not because we were somehow constructed differently than they were or we somehow have more knowledge that the were that they are so we can believe the message or the word of God no if if the grace of God has ever been taken out of us we are exactly the same as the person outside there the only difference is God opened our eyes for us to see this message the only difference is the grace of God was extended to you so you could be called out of sin so you don't have to live the life of a drunker so you don't have to be a prostitute so you you don't have to be caught in sin and darkness the grace of God extended to you is what makes the difference and I want to say this morning that's why as Christians what we desire is for that same Grace to be extended to others we don't want to just SK it for ourselves when you see a person walking out there with purple hair with all kinds of stuff tattoos and everything you don't look at them and trash them and say they are a sinner what you're praying for is oh if the same Grace that have come across if the same Grace that changed me can come to them I tell you Grace can make the difference Grace will bring things that cannot be brought into existence and Grace will change the situation Grace will come and it will come and it will bring the will of God into existence so the scripture will say wherein in time pass you walk after the course according to the course of this world and according to the princes and the power of the air it says the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience among whom you also had our conversation in time pass it says in the lust of your flesh the the the the the the the the fullness of the desire of the Flesh and and your mind it will say even the fullness In the Flesh and the mind the LLY flesh of the mind and were by Nature the children of Wrath even as others so we we can't stand here and boast and and that's why when you meet somebody you try to show him the word or you try to show him the scripture they may not understand it they may not see it then you look and they said how can they not see it it's so simple it's so open and oh it's just the scripture you just read why can't you see you you have to have a mind to understand that the only reason you see it is because God opened your eyes to see it the only reason you understand it is because God made it so you can understand it and if God made you understand it you have to pray that as you're showing them that the same God who made it you to see it that the same God can do for them the same way but God who's rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin and trespass had he Quicken us together with Christ he said by Grace ye are sav not of yourself but the grace of God he had raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come that he might show that he might show his exceeding reaches of his grace and his kindness towards us through Christ Jesus Christ let me say this in the dispensation we live in the dispensation of the fullness of Christ we live in the time so if you take him from Adam and you run it all the way to the end what you see all across the the Bible is the grace of God how it was extended from ages to ages and it says now that in the dispensation of fullness of time oh I even think when we gather around the table and we sit there on our great supper when we begin to tell the testimony of one another it's not going to be how strong you were or how the ability you had to do things or how that you saw things that others didn't see it's going to be the story about the grace of God when we go across and you begin to ask each one how did you make it and you'll talk like we heard this morning oh I was in a place and there was a situation where I could have died and I was caught in the car accident and and this happened and and somehow something happened and Grace came by my way when we begin to go around and talk and said oh I was in the drunkest house and something happened to me oh I was in the church buau I listened to the word day in and day out but one day grace strick my heart and then it changed me it was going to be the S I thought about the the thief at the cross here he was there was no time for him he was there he already squandered everything that he had and he the time that he had he squandered everything and here is it perhaps taking his last breath and close to dying and somehow he looks across him Grace was across him and he looks at him and says as we deserve what's happening to us but this man he doesn't deserve what's happening to him he says oh the Lord that you may remember me that day in the kingdom and Grace looked at him and says this night not another day this night you shall be with me in Paradise that's what Grace did for you that's what Grace can do this morning this morning not another day not tomorrow not another time this morning Grace can change the circumstance that in the dispensation to come when you take it from Genesis all the way to Revelation that in every dispensation it's the story of the abounding grace of God the Grace that started right the beginning but whatam says one PR it says Grace is old oh I like that when Grace was part of the plan Grace was what God made sure that you could get there Grace the grace of God is the only thing from Des from source to destination Grace is the thing that said that no matter what you're going to make it no matter what happens you're going to make it Grace is the thing that knows I know that's going to be difficult ities along the way I know there's going to be challenges across the road I know there's going to be all kinds of stuff happen in between but I'm here to guarantee you that from start to finish you're going to be making it at the end of it oh the grace of God so that's why it's important when we come as Christians it's important we understand that the only reason why we gather here this morning is because of the grace of God and and we and because it started by Grace it will end by Grace it's not Grace and then law steps in between man does that but God doesn't do that so if he started off with Grace we are dependent on his grace every morning when we wake up in the morning our ability to put One Foot In Front Of Another is by his grace our ability to go in prayer and pray for him to do things we dependent on the grace and when we we open our Bibles when we read it's all by his grace so without him we can do nothing without his grace extended without him we are lost as lost could be men always tries to feel like they they they they have done something to Merit the grace of God it's a human nature now even after we have received Grace man tries to pile up work so he can balance out the grace so he can and said well yeah I know God saved me but here I am I've done now so much that I could feel like I deserve that Grace you don't deserve it let me say you don't deserve it that if you can add one Cube to your stature the scripture say then Jesus Christ died in vain so what God wants us to do is to operate and be Reliant solely on his grace when we approach him is by Grace when we receive something is by Grace whatever happens he want want us to be reminded that it's by the grace of God and and and because remember it's Satan who tempts Us by by The Works he he will try and and you know you're like well you know I go to church every day so this can happen to me you say he will do that yeah he did it with the Prophet The Prophet is there and losing his son and his daughter and and his wife and the Devil comes next to him he says you know look at you you've given all your life for this look at you you youve preached and you've done all of this and now you asking him to save your your your wife and your your daughter he wouldn't even do it why he was taking and measuring trying to balance out the grace not understanding that if you ever can do anything it's by the grace of God it's never by men's ability and brother I'm looks at it said they looked at and all of the sudden something took hold within his heart and he knew that everything that he was it was only by the grace of God and he made the great statement he says the lord giveth the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord let me say this morning that's what a Christian is whether it be death that strike sickness that strike whatever strike let me say this I come from God I go back to God whatever happens blessed be his name I'm here to glorify the purpose of the Living God I'm not going to give a devil an inch of my life whatever happens I'm there glorifying God oh it's for the glory of your kingdom it's for the grace the the purpose of Grace being glorified remember it's in the dispensation to come all that's going to be is the glory of that Grace that came to us so as we read as we just saw the scripture will talk to us and say it's according to his grace and all those things and by the the scripture uh oh I just I'll just read this for the second time so so we don't have to go through everything now when you speak about Grace by definition Grace and and and we'll see more as we go by is the unmar favor of God it's the free and unmerited favor of Mighty God you can't work for it you cannot do enough to Merit it you can do enough works to say that you've got it there's nothing that could but says it can't be sold it can't be bought it it's the grace of the Mighty God is God himself Grace it's not fairness it's not oh I have done this therefore I deserve Grace no that's not Grace Grace is the UNM merited favor of God himself Grace is when you you you have done wrong and when you have done all that you done and and and the the natural course of life is that now you deserve the pishman when Adam had done wrong the natural cause was if you eat this you shall die when you done wrong when you committed sin and when you came and and you knew that the natural progression of things things say now I should die Grace is the god stepping in and say not today when when when the course has been run and when you come and you know you have broken the word of God and when you've come you know you've done wrong and you are convinced that whatever is about to come I deserve it when you know that there's no Escape my hands have done it I have done wrong and have walked away I'm a sinner I don't deserve the I deserve to die right now Grace is God stepping in and saying I'm changing the course of your life I I remember and I thought about this Brother David gave this definition that just stayed with me Grace is decision from the Throne of God that changes the course of what's awaiting for you what you know that the the the the the scripture says that the wages of sin is death and and we know that's why we go through our lives and something will happen and and we know oh this is perhaps because what I did over here you know the course and the progression of life and what's way for you but Grace is the grace of God and God himself not another person not an angel God himself stepping in and saying that I know this is what you deserve but I'm deciding to change it I know this is what you're supposed to get but I'm here to change the course of your your life now listen to this brother B says and and for the sake of time I'll just read it I I won't have time to just uh walk through every single one of it and this is this is our qut so you may take it and go search for every qut then and find it but says this grace is love Grace is love Grace is what God does for you works is what we do for God to show up appreciation of what God did for you Grace but by Grace ye are saved it says for it's by Grace we are saved not by what not by what we can do or or or what we can whatever we do is not accountant to us Grace is what saves us Grace he says by Grace you are saved through faith Grace is so far above law law is not even in the picture amen oh I love that Grace is so far above the law that when we talk about Grace is is oh I tell you in the human nature we we judge what's fair and what's not fair yeah he is you can look at somebody and they've done wrong and they've committed a crime and and everybody calls for their punishment or they deserve to die they deserve to die and then the judge come on the bench and he looks at them and says no this person is going to go free everybody's going to rise up and say no this is not fair that's not what they deserve that's what Grace does when you deserve death When Death was knocking at your door when death was there claiming the works that you're done and and you were surely to die Grace of sin and says today is not the day grace is so far above the law the law is not even in the picture Grace is the only thing that takes us through it says never the law never law Grace is a way provided for each individual to return us to the rightful inheritance Grace and this is all the quotes for Prophet saying grace is Grace is the way provided for each individual to return us to the rightful inheritance Grace is still in existence his love and grace is the same tonight says this in another place Grace is old Grace is as old as the world is Grace was first shown to the human race when he when when we had in the beginning of the human race and then he says and his grace is from Everlasting unto Everlasting Hallelujah this morning all what we need this morning is to understand that the only way we can make progress is by the grace of God the only way we can go forward is by the grace of God that's why you don't look at the person next to you and we often time you know do it in our mind even without realizing you look at them and say look at the way the dress or look at them and all of the sudden we come up with a judgment of what they need oh what they need is this and what they need is that let me tell you what we need all of us is the grace of God what we all need is the grace of God let me tell you your words are not going to save any body your your your critics are not going to help anybody what you need is the Heart full of grace when you can go on your knees and pray for somebody and then when you speak Grace will come out and Grace will make a difference the scripture will speak about Adam yeah are oh I wish I just could explain this this morning butam said yeah they are they had sin in the Garden of Eden and here they are the natural cause of a human bam says what they did they ran and they asked they they ran away to get a covering what they did because they had sin what did Sin cause them to do they feel they were unworthy so therefore they looked for something to cover themselves they went after their sin what they were looking for was not to go before God they ran away because they knew what they' done was wrong and guess what religion is is a covering let me say this what we're looking for this morning is not covering we're not here to cover our sins or to cover our wrong what we need is to expose it before God so Grace could be extended say God I'm wrong this morning I done wrong I broke your word I broke your commandment what I need is your grace to be extended to me I I I I don't even have the very definition or know how to do right unless your grace is extended unto me so yeah they are and and and and God knew there was a law that says the day you shall eat you shall die so God comes down in the garden and he looks at them and says all of a sudden Grace came on the scene now he takes and Grace provided a skin a lamb skin for them to be uh to wear that that morning or that evening he came in he provided away he took away the religion and provided him his skin and then he says he looked to them and and by by the word and by the Commandment he had to drive them out of the Garden of Eden but it says gra didn't sto there after they wor those bloody skins and they walking and the skin is beating and the blood is the grace stood up and said I'll make a way this is not the end of it I'll come back and I'll make sure you come back in in the garden let me say this grace is the only thing that makes sure that you can come back into the kingdom of God grace made away it wasn't because they were good and they done good and all of that in fact yes the prophet saying in the messageer hymn uh preached on December 15 uh 1956 paragraph 12 butam says oh I love this it says salvation isn't doing a lot of good works oh my I tell you if you preach that to the Pentecostals Baptist and all of that they're going to kick you right out because the whole religious world is built upon how much good works you can pile up for yourself it it's always about a balance oh if I could put more no good works that means when I get to heaven I'll show the list of my good works and they will look at me and say oh son you've done so much good get in the they they go right across the scripture that says that depart from me doers of iniquity I never even knew you so Grace he says so salvation isn't doing a lot of good works Grace is what brings God to us God Saves Us by grace and no man has never sought God never no man never saw God at any time the Bible says he didn't you say well I S God all night I love this you know we go we do something and all of a sudden inspiration goes up and we feel like oh now I deserve to say you don't deserve nothing and he says it says you you I saw God all night and he said the Bible says he didn't you say I sought God all night no you never God sought you man's very nature in the Garden of Eden proves it instead of her Adam running up and down the garden saying oh Father where are th it was God hunting down Adam and saying Adam where at down the very nature that desire that relies in the Mortal body is we run away and find a covering but the nature of God is always to run after man he says see we turn the we turn the picture around here it says this will settle it if you if if if if for it will settle it for you if there's a question in your mind Jesus say no man can come to me except my father draws him first it says that settles it he says it all right so it's by the the the the the understanding that within us the nature of man we are not built to look for God to search for God to to to we not build for us to to try to please God by our own nature but it's the nature of God to always come after us it's in the nature of God to always provide a way it's in the nature of God to always provide a way of escape and it's not even when we are asking for it it's when we run away we're running away from it's when we are running away from it butam says in the message of Grace paragraph 82 it says the grace of God was promised in the Garden of Eden and Grace came Grace came to Adam and Eve it says nowhere to go no no know which way to turn and yet Grace made a way let me say this it says my sinner friend you may be here this morning a prostitute you may be here this morning a woman Chester you may be here you may be here a drunker or a gambler or a murderer you might be here as an impure husband or an impure wife you may be you may be you may be the vience of Sinners you say I am past the stage of redemption no you are not it says and you wouldn't be here at the church this morning it says Grace will make a way for you in the dark hour if you will just accept it Adam had to be willing to accept it and so do you accept oh my brother my sister what we need is the understanding that it's Grace that's going to get us to the Finish Line Grace is the part of God that's determined that you're going to make it Grace is Jesus Christ himself Grace is the God himself making himself known unto his people saying that today I'm going to make sure that you make it Grace is when you have Oh I thought about brother I'm talking about uh in I I don't know what message is he talks about this lady called uh the lady uh uh makabe of Oklahoma he speaks about her there they is and there's all the religions of the world they gather together and and it talks about I believe the name of the man is Dr Ian or something they come and they gather together and there's this woman with a record that nobody even could even ever heard of uh she's drinking smoking and all kind done all kinds of things and they're looking at her and each religion began to come by and everything they look at her and they look at her they had no hope no answer for her why because every religion is based upon what you can do what you can offer to your God and then so this man comes across and he looks and there she is he says I'm thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ but what says he jumps and he clicks his heel and says I'm thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ it can only not clean her outside but it will also clean her heart let me say this the god that we serve he comes he himself he comes and He makes himself your righteousness thank you it's the only religion that will make a change all the others is how much you can pray and what you can offer and how you can do how many pendants you can do what you can offer the only religion that promise that the God himself will come and he will make himself one with you he will take away your desire of sin he will take away your desire for the things of the world he will wash you a clean he will take his spirit and put it in you don't ever forget that and the scripture will say in Mark 4 it says and he said unto them he that has an ear let him hear and when he has he was alone the scripture says they that were about him and the 12 ask of him the parable and he said unto them unto you it is given to them the mystery of the kingdom of God but unto that are without all these things are done in Parable that seeing listen to this that seeing they may see and not perceive so seeing is not really perceiving there's a seeing where you can see but you're not perceiving in fact the scripture says the kingdom of God it says that it's not unless you are born again it's not given for you to see the kingdom of God not with the eyes but the understanding heart to understand what God is saying and hearing they may not hear and not understand lest at any time that they should be converted in their sin and should be forgiven them so God purposely does it that others receive the grace to see and understand and others don't God purposely does it that when he's rewarded is preached and when the word is going forth that others have the capability of understanding and seeing and others don't and I want to say this morning I'm not here to condemn everybody I'm just thankful that I can see it I'm just thankful that my eyes have been open you know we we we hear yeah we we have this message and we go through it and we talk about it and people Rejoice let let never take it for granted never just look at it and say well I understand what the prophet say I understand this no that's not the right you should be thankful about it and you should be praying for the person next to you so God can do the same thing it's by the grace of God it's not of your effort it's not because you worked hard at understanding it it's because God by his grace he made a way so you can see it the scripture says in Psalm it says Psalm 23 says oh I'll just Skip and read verse uh four it says yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will not fear for thou are with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me it says Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemy and thou anointest my head with oil my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of God of the Lord forever so surely it's not by my strength but surely the Lord has made it so that his goodness and mercy is following me I didn't do anything to deserve it I couldn't earn it whatever I do is only in Thanksgiving for what he already done so Grace is given for a purpose for for a purpose of redemption it's given for the purpose for God to achieve what he wants to achieve out of you Grace is God coming himself and providing Redemption so you can be brought back to the original state that you need to be in oh my I just want to receive his grace this morning I I I think it's always important that you you view things through the eyes of Grace because it's going to help you balance out a lot of things that you understand it's going to remove Grace doesn't puffed up itself Grace hasn't come through a situation where it feels like I've made it or I understand it more than anybody Grace will Grace will keep you humble Grace will make you always understand that if I can do this it's because God allowed me to do that if I can live right it's by the grace of God that I'm living right I love this yes the prophet speaking about Abraham and and it will come in and we understand when God made the first Covenant with Adam is the adamic Covenant it was made by what men can do he said that the day you eat you shall die and you they that they had to stay away from the Tree of knowledge and we understand that they broke that and then God comes and in the The Covenant that he makes with Abraham now he saying that it's not what you do it's all based on what I have done he he's wanting now now to know that there's nothing restricted there's nothing here that you are expected to do except to believe I have taken everything under myself if you accept what I'm giving you you shall be saved the whole Covenant from beginning to end the Fulfillment of it is based on what I have to offer God is sending the Covenant and but what I'm call it it's Abraham Grace Covenant God changing the Covenant to say that this morning if any of us desire anything if you desire to be saved if you desire for your life to be right it's not based upon you it's based upon you believing on what God has already done and if you can receive it this morning God is obligated by his Covenant to change you oh what a covenant this morning oh what that that if I have a need this morning I don't have to rely on my own ability or my own ability of discernment or strength or anything in fact it looks at his word he tells Paul and says in fact let me let you know he says that it's in your weakness that I'm made perfect it's in your weakness that my strength is made perfect so I'm taking your weakness and it's strength to me so if you want to be strong bring your weaknesses to me and I will give you strength he says this in Abraham Grace Covenant par uh preaching old 3117 paragraph 24 it says now he made he made it to Abraham it says not not Abraham not Abraham if you do this a certain thing it says I'll make you great nation of you and make you father of all Nations listen to this now he said I have done it now I I love this because he's not saying I will do it I I want you to cat this he's not saying I'm going to do it no he's saying it's already completed I Abraham I'm giving you a finished work I am giving you a way that's already completed I'm giving you a Grace that's been extended that if you would accept the extended Grace you're going to make it through the grace you're going to make it to my profession so he says I have done it remember the promise is altogether Grace he says not mix not La mixed in it at all not not any it says ifs or at all it's absolutely God choosing of Abraham Abraham didn't do enough works to deserve this he he his Works were never included into this now in fact listen to this butam says he says not even if he says now even if you don't agree with some of the some of it it says let's just give it a prayerful consideration now you see it says it isn't what you do what you done but what our desire it says it wasn't Abraham desire he he was a hidden and he come down from the Tower of Babel down to the valley of Shar and and and in the land of calans in the city of her he says he was just an ordinary man it says nothing Abraham had done not even his [Applause] desire your desire to worship God comes from God [Applause] himself your desire to be holy comes from God himself you didn't create that desire there was was nothing in you to generate that desire so if you really understand what God is saying here it's all together Grace from start to the end it's God fulfilling his word on both side he comes over here he places the desire he runs over here says come onto me and I will make you clean come onto me and I will save you come unto me and I'll provide healing it's all together God from start to finish now listen to this nothing Abraham done not even his desire but God he says by Grace by grace and election he says choose Abraham that's the way he chooses you nothing you have done he done it now remember Abraham and is seed not only Abraham but Abraham and the Sea am I speaking to Abraham see the morning so let me say I love this about God so God is intending to do something at the end time but before he can do it at the end time he has to have a type of which he can point to so he comes to Abraham and in is speak to it's not just Abraham he has a whole generation of people coming at the end time but before he can do it to them he has to have a place where he can show them in the scripture that this is what I'm promising you so he comes to Abraham he says nothing you have done you don't even deserve this I'm laying all of this down on me because he knew that in the end time there'll be a people show up that's going to need this so he comes and he does with Abraham and it doesn't end there it says Abraham end is see what is he doing giving you a way in so you can stand there and say I'm in that scripture I'm in that scripture that scripture belonged to me now I I was thinking about even what brother Andrew preached Wednesday we know we talk about Abraham Journey of Faith one way the Journey of Faith there's going to be doubt manifested somewhere because we have this flesh and as long as we have this flesh we're going to endure battles right so Abraham is told and and I'll just read it for a moment here don't go here don't do this he still does that did I cancel the grace of God no he didn't did God come and says well we got to clean up the board and come up with another plan no the plan was made he included every mistake you'll made everything that will happen the plan is what God Said God will do it the your your wondering is not the plan the plan is he who started the work will finish it the plan is I am God and I change not the plan is what I have spoken it's going to happen anything in between it doesn't matter whether you come this close to death in fact even if you die what did Abraham says he knew God told him to go offer Isaac now Abraham had this one thing he knew I couldn't produce Isaac I had gotten him from the dead my whole body was dead so God gave me Isaac from the dead so if God asked me to kill Isaac I believe that the same way I got I got Isaac from the dead God is able to raise him up again oh what whatam says this in the message of Grace paragraph 84 oh I like this it says I'll call paragraph 85 I'm sorry I'll call another character let me just skip for The Taste sake of time it says oh brother Bram it says how Abraham tested God's patience is that sound familiar you know some of us would test each other's patience to the Limit you know I'm just saying oh how Abraham tested God's patience told them said Abraham stay here in the land don't you go out but as soon as famine came Abraham ran is that sound fam me God said I'll give you a job and I want you to come to church and I want you to come and do this and do this and as soon as the money is not enough another job is calling we start considering as soon as something happen we jump right out listen to this it says at paragraph 86 it says Abraham spoke of us God took Abraham by grace and saved him and that's how he takes you by Grace he says and how we test his patience today we are wrapped up today we are up tomorrow we are down one day we believe the next day we wandering today we are Methodist tomorrow we are Baptist today we believe in Divine Healing tomorrow the tummy egg comes and we don't we don't know whether we believe or not think about it it says but yet in the midst of all of that God wants us to stay put all God is asking and says Don't Run Away don't don't I don't want you to think I'm not seeing what's happening I I I see I'm I'm the creator of Heaven and Earth he says he knows how many how many how many times the the the fly bats his ey he knows the the the number of hair in your head I see all things don't think I don't see all of that all I'm asking is stay put hang on wait for Grace I you I'm not going to let you die I'm not going to let you fall I'm not going to let wrong come unto you I'm The Man In Charge here just wait for me stay put he says but he saves us anyhow he says if he wasn't great by the the grace of God will all be done sure God Saves Us by his grace Abraham was supposed to stay in the land but went down into the into the calans or or in the Philistine went down and and sojourned and got out and got out of the famine thing and his the things was a little hard up in this country and he went down there and so turned down uh with him done exactly what God told him not to do but yet the grace the the grace of God appeared to him and kept Pharaoh or the king from taking his wife Grace it says it says when God said uh when when Abraham said it's my sister lied about it and yet the grace of God held him because he repented and he was willing to repent but mam says this and anybody that's willing to repent the grace of God still goes on to you the grace of God is searching for you so that so that goes with you backslider this morning the grace of God is still looking for you if you just repent God's grace is sufficient Grace God is not run out of Grace oh my brother my sister we look at situation God is not like a man you know I can come to brother say give me $1,000 give me give me another thousand he'll come to a time and say brother I I I only have so much you know I I can only help you so much but the grace of God is not so God who Infinite in Mercy his Mercy never runs out why because his Mercy is for a purpose so if the mercy cannot fulfill the purpose then what is the mercy for the mercy is so that no matter what you're going to make it no matter what happened the objective is going to happen happen aren't you thankful for his Mercy this morning oh I I I'm just let me just skip to the end now but when I'm talks about the mercy that is to be revealed in the end time oh my brother my sister and and he reads the scripture if you ever go listen to the message message of Grace he reads the scripture in Zachariah 4 and I'll just read a couple of verses for the sake of time um Zechariah 4 verse six it says and and this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel and I've spoken on it a little bit but I'll just summarize it for the sake of time perhaps another day we'll just focus on this scripture it's a very wonderful scripture so we understand this was the time of the building of the temple we understand that Nehemiah had built the walls but it was it was zerubabel who was supposed to build the temple and Bam talks about how it was zerubabel who lay this was I believe the story the history says that the temple that zerubabel built was a different one because the one that Solomon had build was taken down so he laid the foundation and they said this Temple was a little bit uh smaller than the original so he comes and he lay the foundation and and if you know the story of Jeremiah you know that there was opposition from left and right there was opposition from all the neighbors because they didn't want them to build to build either the walls or the restoration of the temple so now the word of God is coming and and and and the purpose of that word to come was so he can Comfort them to tell them that I'm with you you continue to build you continue to do this because I'm with you you're doing my work and I'm going to protect you so it says that and and then he answered and spoke unto me say this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel so God is sending his word and his message of Grace andto zabel uh trying to confront him in the season that he was going in to tell him that you you this work is going to be completed by your hands is wanting him to know that no I I know there's opposition there's all kinds of things happening but the the hands of zerubabel that started the foundation the hands of zerubabel will lay forth the the the The Headstone but says it wasn't the the the Capstone but it was The Headstone so he says he will come and he will lay the the the the the the the headstone he says the same hands that did it so now this is the word of of the Lord unto zorobabel saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel it says not by might nor by power but by the spirit of the Lord of H he says who are thou oh great Mountain before zerel that shall be that shall become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone it says therefore shouting with a shout crying Grace Grace unto you the word of God in the end time that will lay forth the Cornerstone that will lay for The Headstone it's not going to be by Mighty tunders or by Mighty works it's going to be a tiny man of Kentucky a man that looks like no one a man that couldn't even speak and is not going to be a man with some great honor or whatever it's going to be with such Grace that if you don't pay attention you're going to miss it the word of the Lord the same God who lay the foundation stone the same hands the same hand will finish it and then he said the word of the Lord come unto me saying the hands of zerubabel has laid the foundation of this house and the hands will will complete it it says then you will know then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me unto you so let me say this the message of God in the end time is only by grace let me say this because remember he says without Divine love we cannot get to the other side let me say this without Grace we couldn't make it but what says this it says paragraph 56 it says but according to the prophecy of message of Grace there will come a headstone it says and I want you to notice when The Headstone comes the prince that's going to cry out Grace Grace for it's by the grace of God we are saved not of your works that any man should boast and the message of Grace is being tramped under the feets of men until it becomes disgrace some of them Runs Out in internal security and some runs into all the everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same amen the true message of Grace Remains the Same what is the message of Grace Luke 17:30 what is the message of Grace Revelation 10:7 what is the message of Grace that unto you I will send Elijah the prophet according to the scripture God still has Grace I don't care what you're going through this morning there's still the grace of God in the house of God in the people of God you know people try to conform people and and all you care about is how the person dress and if they're dressed like a message believer then that's it no what we need is the grace to change the hearts the grace to bring conversion the grace to fill the hearts with love the grace to change the nature of man that's right it says it says it's still the same and it says and that's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's the grace of God we are all saved by oh my and I begin to think butam says in paragraph 130 of the same message it says Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign One Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign One Sovereign Grace from The Sovereign One Sovereign he says what can he do Sovereign it says Sovereign can do can do whatever he wants to do he says listen now Sovereign Grace can only be given by one that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign so he can give Sovereign Grace therefore being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask anybody think about it God comes and says oh Christian Life Tabernacle who do you want God to save today man we're going to exal one another like crazy oh this one God didn't ask you who he should say so if God saved the person next to you all you could do is love them because it wasn't you choosing to begin with you know people look at other people or not I'm not talking about talking about your church you know you look at out people like oh there's no way you know who are you to decide it's the Sovereign Grace Of The Sovereign God he decide who he wants to save our part of it is just oh thank God that's why we said when we get over there it's going to be the glory of the let me say this there's going to be a lot of shock running across as a I can't wait to be on the other all of our mouths will be open why is a marvelous God he takes the rank sinner the one that you didn't give a chance the one that everybody wrote off the one that everybody thought would make it Grace comes by the way Grace brings him in the Kingdom it's not your choosing it's God's choosing I'll tell you it's going to be the glory of the grace it's going to be how powerful this Grace was to save a rich like me one who didn't deserve to be in a Congregation of saints one who feel like has seen himself away God takes him and says it's not by your works but my grace is made sufficient oh let me just say this butam says this now at the end time he says this this lady is called Lady Grace now I say this it's the glory of the grace that is to be revealed at the end time now at the end time the bride is not just called the bride it's called Lady Grace who is she miss Jesus Christ it's saying that there was no grow no grace extended like he be there at the end time this is the this is if I can say it's the guy gaing up together of all that God was trying to do and it comes at the end time and he says who is she he says she's predestinated elected Lady Grace such Mercy such Grace she couldn't even deserve it Eve send the grace away she was given and she s it and comes it says but Eve at the end time this eve can never fall why because she's part of the word what a Grace and let me say that he doesn't stop there Grace comes at the end time and looks at you and says it's no as if you never even done it you tell me about that may I add this woman invisible Union paragraph 40 it says may I he this woman may I place her in the Bible also it says it's call the elected lady paragraph 40 of invisible Union it says this missg Grace I'm going to talk about know the Bible declar says to the elect lady if you would notice elect comes from the word elected lady one lady among all the other ladies was elected I'm just thankful how this I I can't comprehend this with my human mind I have no capacity to put this together all I do is rejoice in what God has already done he says like the Virgin Mary was to BR to bring forth the body of the Lord of of the of God on Earth and then she was elected woman God chose Mary it says and also God God has a chosen elected lady which is the bride she's elected and I hope you are member of that tonight it said tonight across the world Across the Nation he continues on the illustration here showing the relationship of of the Bride to Christ the elect lady it says how she was to be brought to him where it says she would come from and how that she would be brought to him the church here is the illustration it says that we got to we got we got in view is illustration by a woman which a woman is the type of the church because the church is considered a bride a bride she's the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ the son of of God let me just say this he comes in such a age and a Darkness age that we are living in yeah we are in but says Darkness upon the Earth and gross Darkness upon the people the only age where Satan is called the God of this evil age no Darkness like this age he comes here and God that's where he chooses to call his bride what Grace he comes in the midst and and time like this where he it it it seems impossible where it seems like there's no way anything good could come out of it God said The more sin abound the more Grace will abound God said well this situation is just so perfect for me to show what the extension of myig gr can really do God comes and says now this is and let me say this this morning it doesn't matter how Darkness you are living in how the situation is worse in your life and let me say this the more darker it gets the more God can doall the worse he gets the more he's there to do why because that's his election that's what he promised you will do here it comes in the paragraph 229 of the invisible Union it says how can you come to this he says we were deceived and he talks about we were deceived we were deceived he says by our first marriage to come by the adulterous parent it was no fault of our own by the nature of birth you come as Eve came and you committed adultery that's the reason we are born in adultery you are a sinner to begin with it says that's right you was deceive into it you had he says you you it was it end your fault it says you never did it because that little germ that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life what Grace somebody tell me how to explain this Grace there's no beginning to it there's no ending to it it's all God stretching himself doing all that he can for the elected one if the musician could come says that the mother Eagle knew that she had an somewhere and as far as the little iglet was concerned they had no understanding all they knew was they were born in the chicken yard and all the desires everything they looked at and it was nothing but Chicken Scratch in the barnyard all they could do is scratch and scratch but yet the mother Eagle knew that they had an egg somewhere and the prophet said that every evening every night the mother Eagle will just fly around be looking be looking be searching be looking and he said and one day this Eagle that was in the chicken scratch and it says so one day the mother knew that she had lay two eggs and she had begin to hunt that one flying around and searching like that great Holy Spirit it says one day he flew over the Barnyard he calls it the denomination she looked down there and seen her baby God's children she screamed and it was a voice and some Echo from inside of him something Echo from inside of him that sound that sounds right let a real predestinated bone germ predestinated of God hear the word of God it's music to him what is that that's Grace how is it that I hear this word and something within my heart says I believe it I love it how is it that I hear it and and it echoes the sound just expands my heart and and my heart just beats and I hear it there's just a impulse of faith in my heart to say I believe every bit of it it's Grace it's truth it says he knows it's the truth he says we tried of all we tried of all that denomination stuff anyhow to join and come and go with us and go with us and we got in the social parties and we got this and and did that that that sounded right but that was that that didn't sound right to the little fellow she said Son you don't belong in that group anyhow you belong to me you are mine and let me say this this the word of God to you this morning in whatever circumstance you are in the word of God to you this morning is you don't belong in there get out the word of God to you when he came to laia church H he says come out from amongst them ye my people the word of God when it sounds to your heart is calling you out of your sins and calling you out of the things of the world and calling you out of the habits of the world why is telling you you don't belong in there to begin with you don't belong in there come out what is doing that it's the grace of God that's doing it am and the scripture says when you hear his voice do not Harden your heart let's open our hearts this morning and say father I hear your word you know I thought about the woman that was caught in adultery they the came and and they brought him she was caught in adultery so there was no defense you couldn't argue what happened they she was brought before Jesus and they came in the lay there and to him and in fact they said it was so they can see what he's going to do and he looks at him and they came and they all looking there each one with the stone waiting to see what they're going to do waiting to for them to bring judgment upon her and say that you deserve to die so they look and all gather and and the scripture says that Jesus was writing down and and just writing and writing and so he looks at them and he says that so let's he who without through the first stone and the message started to Echo in the hearts of people and one by one they dropped the stone and walked away when Grace speaks everything else shuts up when Grace speaks the Judgment disappear when Grace speaks everything goes away why because Grace has the ability to take sins and turn it into righteousness Grace has the ability to take the wrong works and bring it into the work of righteousness Grace has the ability to take the wrong Sinner and make them a Believer so he looks at him and and then Jesus looks at the woman and says woman where are thy accuser she looks at him and says there's nobody to accuse it says they all gone away there's nobody to judge me here but only you what you say now they forget that when he came he said I came to the Lost ship of Israel the work of God or the message of God is for the purpose of restoration the word of God is not saying to destroy you or send you to Hell butam says that hell was made for the devil and his Angel it was not made for men men goes there because they don't want to receive Grace so he looks at there and he speaks and he says neither will I it says Go On th way and sin no more and that's what the message of the hour done to us it says go on the way and sin no more receive the grace of God this morning let's all stand oh if we can receive the grace this morning if we can open our hearts to the grace that's been extended God's grace to you is the message of the hour so you don't have to continue in the things that you are called in so you could be changed to be a true son and a daughter to God how many wants his grace this morning let's just lift our hands to him and pray to him just open your mouth and thank him for your his grace and and ask him if you could just pull his grace and to you and to the person sitting next to you and said our gracious father we're so thankful to be gathered in your house Lord and father we deserve and to die and we didn't deserve your grace and but Lord you in the same time you open up Grace and you done something for us that we couldn't do for ourself and Lord we just want to open our hearts and say come by our way and make your word known unto us oh
