Description:
Sunday Evening Service
March 30th, 2025
Christian Life Tabernacle
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believers in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

Father Lord surely you're worthy Lord worthy of our praise worthy of our joy worthy of our shout Lord Jesus and as we heard it this morning Lord you're worthy of our surrender Lord Jesus father you're worthy of all things father we think back as when John was looking to see if there was anybody that was worthy that could take the book lord loose the seals therein father for he knew the importance of an open book Lord Jesus we wouldn't be here Lord if it wasn't for that Lord but thanks be to God the elders told them weep not for Behold a lion of the tribe of Judah here's one that's worthy Lord Jesus father you took our place Lord Jesus you became our sin that we might be your righteousness father teach us Lord and help us Lord to surrender more father to give of ourselves more Lord to let you have the preeminence Lord Jesus put us aside father foolishly we think we have something to play but truly Lord there's nothing that we can do outside of give up Lord Jesus for you know the perfect will you know the perfect work father it is your Plan of Redemption it is all yours from beginning to end Lord Jesus you knew before the foundation of the world your children would be gathered in this house tonight Lord Jesus you knew who would be here Lord and you knew who wouldn't have the ability to make it back lord Jesus but for father I count Lord Jesus that because you made preparations for it that there is a blessing to them Lord that have made the sacrifice to be in your house Lord Jesus father they didn't come to hear from a man Lord Jesus but they came to hear from you Lord set me aside Lord anoint my lips father and speak something to your people Lord Jesus these are the ones you died for Lord Jesus these are the ones you give of yourself for father you took the beating Lord Jesus you took the nails father for these people Lord Jesus we weren't good Lord Jesus we weren't deserving of it father but you found favor in US Lord Jesus you gave us grace and mercy Lord Jesus how we thank you for that father Lord our heart's desire is that our lives may be found worthy Lord Jesus help us in this journey in this walk father we leave the remainder of this time in your hands Lord you know what they have need of Father minister to each one father let not one leave from this place without something Lord Jesus not from a man Lord but from you Lord Jesus we thank you Father we ask all these things we want to remember our pastor once more Lord Jesus he's a warrior Lord father strengthen him Lord Jesus we love him Lord we appreciate him and all that he does for the body Lord Jesus we pray prayer for all those that are out making the way back from Oklahoma Camp Lord I pray Lord that they may come back with something greater than just a good time father but let it be a word change that will cause them to never be the same again Lord that's our heart's desire we ask all these things in the wonderful precious mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you'll turn with me thank you musicians to Matthew 16 I really enjoyed what our pastor preached this morning amen excuse me I thought it'd be he'd give us a part two but you know I'm I'm up here but the Lord knows what he does and he knows why all I can come here to tell you is the effect of the word in my life I can't give you anything else outside of how he deals with me amen we surely appreciate our pastor let's we'll start in the 24th verse of Matthew 16 the scripture reads then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it for what is man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul let's turn again to Isaiah the 64th chapter we'll just read verse believe the 6th verse it reads one moment I lost myself here it reads but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness are as filthy rags and we all do Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated seated if I were to title this little thought I I won't be long let me get my my clock out we're going to shoot for 30 minutes if we're less praise the Lord but if we're long praise him anyways as I was thinking about what our pastor preached this morning the path forward is the way back I got to thinking you know brother Brandon's talking about how uh a man would look at himself and think that he's got a better suited way he's got a better suited path for himself rather than relying on Jesus Christ and it it got me pondering you know when you go back and you look at how it was in the beginning when Jesus Christ was first here and how he made man brother Brandon would say he made man to completely be dependent on him and the problem was when Adam fell was Adam had what brother Brandon would describe as unconscious Faith there was no thought in what he spoke what he spoke was so in line with the things of God because there was no reasoning behind it everything was the mind of God the thoughts of God that's what's been restored back to us in this day and we look when he would call the disciples one by one each of them had a convocation had work something that they were doing and what he had to do was when he called them they had to leave that convocation whatever the work that they were doing and completely follow him they surrendered everything they were fully trusting for him to provide for what they would have need of what they would eat where they would sleep imagine following a man you know we look in in this time those that followed brother brandom sure you had you know you had hotels and motels you probably could have stayed at or family friends that you knew and so forth but imagine walking miles on miles on Miles with the same pair of shoes the effects it would have on your feet the the Mind battle you may have in your mind do I really do I really have to follow this man man he 300 miles that's a distance goodness me man that's far oh do I really have to drive 25 minutes to get to church that's a long time do I oh man you know what I'm only 15 minutes away you know I I I'll start getting ready five minutes before I have to leave and then I'll get there you start looking at the attitudes that we have because of the Comforts that we have it's a bit different from that which they had that's right right it it meant something to leave not all not all the disciples were maybe married but some of them were and you're leaving all of that to follow a man you're unpacking but in this day and age for some reason we have the idea that if we follow Christ or we fully surrender to the leadership of Christ that we've got a part to play that we've got to pack certain things that we've you know I want to add this I I want to take this part away I want to do this this is my part to play but this is we have to fully surrender Ambitions plans goals idea everything is a surrender it's a complete trust in him I I've always enjoyed when when Billy Paul would give testimonies about brother Brandon one of the testimonies that always struck me he said daddy didn't always have somewhere to stay he said daddy didn't always have a suit he said Daddy would sometimes sleep in his car that's the cost this message was given to us I wonder what price we pay what sacrifice we make if that's how it came how do we expect to continue on any other way but the sacrifice sometimes it'll get uncomfortable sometimes you may not like it the taste of this preacher I just don't like the his Cadence the way he speaks I I just don't like but is the word being spoken to You Are we more focused on how it's being delivered rather than the matter itself that's where we start getting in trouble I got I got to thinking we today imagine this is the only I guess I would say for those that fly a lot this is the only trip where the itinerary is nothing nothing and if you're a person that likes to plan everything to the detail on a trip man trips like this are hard cuz you don't know what you'll need like I'll say you won't know what you'll need you won't know what you'll need how could you trust in that like imagine I told you hey let's take a trip we're going to go to Western give me a give me a country India we're going to go to India yes man we're going to go to India and I say don't pack anything we're going to completely trust God to provide everything that we have need of where we'll stay in fact how we'll get there I'll give you my card it's got 0 on it but your faith will get on that computer you'll put in information and it'll pull the exact amount you have need of for the trip it's like brother you're kind of insane what are you talking about I need preparations man I got to make sure that I I see the money's there that I can count it one two three you mean nothing I've I've got nothing I'm supposed to completely rely though I can't see anything completely have faith that a God would lead me somewhere that I didn't understand and he would provide EX exactly what I had need of yes that's the kind of God we serve we've gotten lazy I speak of myself here where we have to see something we can't no longer trust God blindly if God puts an unction on your heart to do something we have to reason it out until it makes sense in our mind we won't move well at that point you've missed the purpose imagine a prophet getting off that plane going to that woman Parson that was waiting for you how'd you know I was a persons what was he trusting in what was he walking in he didn't know all he knew he got off his plan he's turn right turn left he's just completely listening to what the spirit is telling him to do but us and and this is what fascinated me with what our pastor preached this morning our path forward is the way back and then brother Brandon would talk all the days of our life it brought me to this quote in the marriage of the land brother brandom says the next thing A promise is made and there has to be a promise made to one another paragraph 85 like that you make a promise sweetheart if you'll marry me I promise that I'll be loyal and true I will look upon No Other Woman or I'll look upon no other man and I'll do all that as a duty as a wife we have children it'll do all as a duty as a mother I'll be a housekeeper all these promises has got to be made or should be in a correct wedding and that's the same thing when you come to Christ Lord if you ever receive me into your kingdom I promise there you are I'll love you I'll be true to you I'll serve you day and night it's too bad we forget that see when a prophet says something like that you know so you got to step back what am I forgetting what what are these commitments that I made to God oh my brother told me a story once he had a vehicle he goodness me okay so I promised that I'd be short and um we're going to um yeah so the brother made a promise he said Lord if you give me a vehicle I will be in church every time the doors are open there was no way for him to get a vehicle but he got a car by the grace of God and for as long as he was in the house of the Lord that car never broke down the moment he stopped the car started having issues that's an example what about us Lord if you save me if you take me out of this circumstance and situation I'll never be found here again Lord if you save me if you heal me because brother brandham said we have to have a purpose for our healing there's got to be a motive anded behind it it can't just be so that I can glory in my own healing no why do you want to be saved why do you want to be healed why do you want to be delivered there's got to be a purpose behind it the prophet of God will say God doesn't just save you and put you on a shelf there's a job for you to do there's something you must do how often we forget some of the promises we make he says it's too bad we forget that I'll serve you day and night I'll fast I'll pray I'll be loyal to you I'll bring tithings to the storehouse I'll pray many times a day I'll do anything and I'll pledge all my love to you that's what you should do that's exactly right where you promised that and it should come from your heart then he says that's what two in paragraph 117 that's what too many so-called Christians do sharing your love with the world playing dancing gambling staying home from prayer meetings to watch television all kinds of worldy things that took place that took the place of the love of God in the church's heart she's gone on a tantrum she's gone wild she's gone out after other men she is sharing her love she'll take her tithing that she should give to the church she'll spend it on other things out there in the world she'll instead of instead of loving God the way she should do and living for God and loving to come to church you almost have to persuade her to come remember this is focusing on what our pastor preached about man thinking he has the right idea he cre he'll create his own religion that fits him Lord I I you got me every Sunday morning you got me every Wednesday but Sunday night I I need me time I just got to relax you know I got to be up early at 6:00 a.m. to go to work I don't know a God that you sacrifice come into his house that he doesn't bless on the other hand if you do please let me know because the only God that I know is when you sacrifice everything for him all that you have need of somehow Finds Its way to you talking about a complete surrender if I were to title this thing I'd title it back to the original leadership because I I got to looking at myself because that's all you can do not oh I know that brother he don't come to church oh I know that sister man she just something else no this is you just it's you and God imagine this is a building that's empty and it's just you and him when something strikes don't attach it to someone else make it personal for you sometimes I feel we come to church for other people I got to show them that I know how to worship I got to show them that I know what I'm talking about but then you look at your personal life in your own walk and something's lacking the leadership isn't there the complete surrender isn't there this is the only race going forwards is going backwards you got to step back sometimes look at the big picture like our Pastor said this morning it's not the quick winds the fast winds it's longterm it's an investment to be in his house it's an investment to be in the word because when times get tough you've got something to pull from but if you haven't made the right investments in the right things now you're stranded in a trial and you've got nothing to draw from from this this this this quote just stood out to me so much one moment see that's the nature of man he wants his own way God did not make man to desire his own way God made man to depend on him to forsake his ways to crucify his way he likened us unto sheep you don't have to raise your hands but I believe everybody in this room at some point had something they wanted to do that God said not to do yet you did it why is that because you reasoned it out and you saw no issue with the matter but we don't see from from what perspective God's looking at it's like the scripture that says would you you got to think about if your if your son asks you for bread would you give him a snake not every good gift catch what I'm saying not every good gift is meant for you ask for all the blessings God will give you exactly what he planned to give you if this person here has amassed this amount of wealth does not mean it'll be the same thing for you but what you can trust is that regardless of what they've amassed and what you have at the end of the matter when the book is finally closed the destination's the same you have to completely have faith in God there's nothing you can do we we're in a society today where people have drummed up in their mind that I'm I'm a believer I'm going to believe in Christ but I'll I need this degree in order for me to get that job that I'm looking for I'm not I'm I'm not speaking against education if that's the path God set for you praise be to God go ahead in that path what I'm saying is you've made it a crutch something that you rely on it's not education that produces the job it's God that produces the job because you can find one that's lacking and one that has the degree but the one that's lacking has a higher position than the one that has it why is that because God's no respector of person you're his favorite when you ask for something though it may seem impossible to you he grants it why he's the good father he knows exactly what you have need of and when when you have need of it you make it ask you cry Lord I've sighed and cried all my life I just can't seem to pass this certain amount of income per year I I just I don't know how I can get across to that other side I don't and and your entire life you start fixating on that thing and you fail to the purpose of this life is not for income the purpose of this life is for us to get out of here we don't want to just be focused on man I got to make this next dog I got to make this next dollar you'll lose sight of everything we have a one trck mind on the things of God I love what our Pastor said it's not work Life Church Life this life no I'm doing everything unto the Lord if I can't do it unto the Lord I probably shouldn't be doing it if school starts taking up your time for God look into why that is maybe you take till the last minute to get assignments done and then the Lord suffers you know I got this assignment d man you know this do at 11:59 when did you get it two weeks ago oh I can't come to church man I just it's it's dude I have to do it you know what I mean like this is a part of my my path I have have to get there don't let the Lord suffer because of your procrastination do those things today don't put them off for tomorrow I you're the number one procrastinator is the one that's speaking to you I have a gift of doing things last minute I almost believe doing it last minute gets the best results but then my Time Slips Away the focus changes you put things off so much brother the BL say something good during our youth meeting now you're just putting out fires you put this Sol so long maybe it's a two-minute task you say you know what it's 2 minutes I'll do it four minutes before it's due that's right and then you have a computer issue and now you're oh man how do I get this Miss uh yeah man my computer it wasn't working so I wasn't able to get the assignment done when did you realize it wasn't working ah you know about three minutes ago like we we got to be real with ourselves sometimes we do the same thing in our spiritual life life it's your duty to feed it's your duty to pray it's not right when your world is crumbling down then you start Lord how many hell mares can I make in a moment Lord help me Lord help me Lord help me it's it's lazy living you prepare for trouble when trouble's not there that's when you prepare it's not when the trouble arises now I have to get ready at that point you're late you've lost we want to be led by God we want to go back to that original leadership but bam describes it unconscious faith that word fascinates me because I'm conscious how do you have unconscious Faith you completely remove your own Ambitions and goals you fully engulf yourself in the word in so much when you speak it's only the things of God it's not your ideas it's not your thoughts but it's him he comes in you and he lives the life I've been looking at the story of vashy of Esther and it just it it fascinated me what a good read this is why it's important to read your Bible because you start seeing things when you take the time and you can apply it to your life you notice Esther was not given anything special compared to all the other virgins that were brought forth they all had access to the exact same thing it just so happened the king's Chamberlain hegi said this is what's been given for you to Adorn yourself now there are plenty of other things that you could ask for and it'll be given to you everyone else started getting googly eyes ooh maybe I can add this maybe I can do this you know what man if I jump this High then yeah yeah I've got something this one over here man if I just learn to speak in tongues the right way if I just learn how to do this you start trying to add things rather than just take what the king gave you and here Esther when it comes to her turn she says you know I don't want anything outside of what he's requesting and she put that on my Bible tells me it's been given to us that righteous clothing for us to Adorn ourselves in our problem is we want to add but our righteousness is as filthy rags we want to add things to make us more righteous rather than just take what he said and live by it and it's because of that when he went unto the king the scripture says she found favor and Grace the law was WR written she could not enter into the king's chamber there was a law but because she found favor and Grace when there was be when it became life or death she said either I will perish that's that's a different kind of Faith she knew where she stood at that point she knew she had his favor she knew she had his grace there was a time where we couldn't enter into the holies of holies because of our sin because of our unrighteousness and the way we were but a price was paid now it's life and death if you don't get into the holies of holies there's certain death we must enter in how do we enter in not by The Works that I can do not by anything that I could muster up but solely by surrendering father have your way what would you have me do today brother Randon makes this statement he says I know that makes people hate me sometimes but you'll love me when I meet you over Yonder I'll tell you the truth it's a foundation no matter what it cost you'll be sincere and tell the truth recognize it to be God be holy for I am Holy he said quit living in sin he's describing the story here of a young man that went away and he left a woman with a vow with a promise of something he says these people would go drink and carry on it's in sermon hearing re receiving and acting paragraph 223 these people would go out and drink and carry on but one young man they noticed that young man he didn't carry on like that he didn't carry on like that he lived clean at night time he come home and went to bed he lived like a gentleman should live and one day the old caretaker said I like to take a walk with you son he said all right they started up the hill walking together towards the setting of the Sun and he said young fellow you can came over with that Bunch you came over with that bunch of Americans didn't you and he said yes sir I did he said I want to ask you something he said 'all right he saidh why is that you don't go out and drink and carry on' laying out with the girls and things all through the night and coming the next morning way they do he stopped put his arm around the old man he said you see the way the Sun is setting Yonder in the west he said yes sir I do he said beyond that setting of the sun there's a certain state in New England State and said in that certain state is a certain city and in that certain city is a certain house in that certain house is a certain girl and that girl I vowed before I came here to be true to her that when when I return we're going to be married she he made a vow to me a promise therefore sir all my attention is attracted as far as it comes to woman towards that girl at that place and he said I live today for tomorrow to come what a testimony see that struck me I live today for tomorrow to come that means the decisions I make today is with the end goal in mind nothing that I make as far as decision idea is separate from the end goal if the end goal is Rapture every decision must reflect Rapture if the end goal whatever the end goal is make decisions towards that goal our problem is we make we say we have an end goal but then we look at the decisions we make and something's not matching the puzzle piece doesn't come together we say we want God but will compromise we're talking about leadership a complete surrender back to the original I want complete surrender in my life you know that Devil comes into your mind I I got to thinking about this trying to make yourself righteous trying to get yourself there so you start I got to do this I got to do that I got to move here I got to go there and you start doing all these things and at first you attribute that to the Christ in you it's the Christ in me that's trying to do all these things but my my my Bible tells me something different it says it's it's his work he's the one that calls and draws he's the one it's not me trying to get there it's him getting me there but in the process of me trying to get there then you get that voice in the back of your mind that starts to tell you you know you're unworthy you know you can't make it you've got too many faults too many mistakes people know about you that you know your sins you know what you did last night you you know who you really are you know what you watch you know how you speak you know how you talk with your friends the crowd you hang around you're nothing you're not not going to make it what's that voice it's not anything that it's saying is wrong in fact it's telling you the truth it's telling you who you are that it is attached to but that voice can't reach the real you you can only speak to that real you by the word because it only responds to the word it doesn't respond to your vain efforts it's no different when brother bandam dealing with that woman from from that time and she goes well brother bandam I tried I tried to do right you know I I I gave my life I stood up I said I turned a new page i' done all the said young lady no the devil's stronger than you think this is not about your effort you need a touch from him what you need is an experience something that's an anchor and she she got down on her knees and she was praying she said Lord Lord Lord and cried out and cried out and stood back up and said brother B I'm going to be different today watch a prophet he says you've done the same thing every time what has it gotten you it's not about you turning the page see that's what the devil puts in your mind no you can fix this you can make this right you can't fix this that's why he had to die but it it got to a Point butam says the devil is stronger than you think God has to come in your life and remove him before he ever entered you talk about Justified and never did it in the first place that's what it was and when she got down to pray brother said he saw her get deeper in sincerity when she got up that time it wasn't brother Bram I'm going to be different she said brother brandom something happened what we need in this hour is something happened I've got the guide on the inside this is different from before this isn't Ben trying to get it there this isn't Ben trying to make himself ready no no no this is something else I feel something on the inside that's stronger than me that's pulling me I don't know where that thing came from but all I know it's right I maybe I ought to follow it just a little while and you watch when you start listening to that voice and follow that voice it'll get you to where you are trying to go oh no but I'm young I got time I don't have to give my life I I don't need to be led just yet I'm still young I want to enjoy life I want to go and party why can't I wear that thing why can't I talk that way why can't I go to those dance parties why can't I do these things man people in America are free disregard that people in America are free they can do whatever they want to do man I just want to be free I feel like I'm I'm I'm in shackles I'm Bound in this message man I I can't do anything I'm not comfortable you know what a prophet said about that he said there's something blinding you he said the Americans are the most enslaved people on this planet they're enslaved up here thinking they're doing right thinking they're free when in fact they can't think for themselves everything that's fed to them is straight from the pits of Hell there's no greater freedom I don't care how young you are it pays to be in the word of God it pays to serve him it'll save you from scars mistakes regrets I know what I'm talking about things you wish you would have never done if you'd have just given in but oh you you get in the SM you know I don't I don't need to be led I'm tired of dad telling me what to do I'm tired of mom telling me what to do I know what I'm doing cuz I've been here longer I'm a grown man I'm a grown woman I make my own decisions you can't tell me nothing it's that exact attitude that ends up in man you should have told me every time it never fails oh man if You' have just told me man I wouldn't have done that what do you think was happening all the time you come to church the word speaks to you the leadership listen don't go that way don't listen to that Ricky don't do this don't do that yeah you know he's just talking this guy loves me you don't understand he buys me roses and flowers what's love what's true love if it's not Desiring Christ for one another then what is it so some sometimes I I look at myself and I'm like man Ben what you you need to you need to be led more you need to die more Die daily a true death you wake up in the morning and you take the time it it struck me if you just get alone with God and you say Lord I'm not leaving till you touch me if we started our day like that every single day I find it really hard for us to have hard times not saying they will lack but the hard time won't be so hard because you'll be you'll know who's on your side and you'll recognize this is just for a season this is just for a moment he's getting a character out of me he's doing something I may not see it I may not understand it but I'm trusting in his leadership we get no man I want the easy life I got the Holy Ghost I'll never struggle again I'll pay all my bills on time I'll never be a dollar short and then when it happens you begin to think to yourself man I've gone astray oh Lord why have that forsaken me because you're short a dollar why is Thou forsaken me Lord oh I wanted to go to that trip and I couldn't do it why is Thou forsaken me my goodness I wanted that car why is th forsaken me when one stood up there with nail-pierced hands for you and I between us who is really the one that was forsaken he paid a price he didn't know for you and me and he wants to come in you and lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness and we fight at that we don't want to give into that because our first nature Desir us to be in control we have to die to this man he's not your friend people worshiped brother brandom they really worshiped him and you know what bothered him when he stood up there one day and said you want me to tell you my greatest enemy is brother Brandon man I I thought he was a good dude man I man I was following him and now he's telling me he's his enemy man I don't know what to do now we do everything can you imagine we pamper this flesh we'll give this flesh the best food you'll work it out if you if you decide you'll do whatever I want I want this these eyes to see the best things in the world I want to go this place and see all these beautiful sites you we pamper this flesh so much and give every single little desire that it has and it's our greatest en enemy that man that that one's always troubles me cuz if you don't pamper it and you don't feed it it dies but the more I feed it it's killing me I have a law in my members I got to feed this dead man but the spirit man on the inside the real you the one that's separate from this flesh man try feeding him a little while see if he doesn't take over the problem is we feed this outside man too much we pamper him too much starve him sometime and just feed that inner man I wholeheartly believe if you lacked something to eat physically and you said Lord I'm going to read this scripture this will be my meal if we had the faith and that's the problem it's just a concept now you say that somebody says man I let him try it if I'm hungry I'm eating just try it for a second does the word not say oh taste and see that the Lord is good try it for a moment and see if he do do it I know what it means to have nothing and completely rely on him to produce something and he does it but if I could just get him to if I could just get that same Bend in those moments to be every time life would be so much easier if I could have the same faith for everything and I fully relied on him life would be so much easier I we want to make a Rapture that's the path forward we want to be mature we want to have authority but the greatest man that ever had Authority had leadership he didn't have unchecked power God never gives a man unchecked power so this idea that I'm this all powerful being when I see Satan I'm going to cut his head off no if that's not your battle you'll walk right past the situation you said well that's not possible man me I'm a warrior if I see sin I'm going to fight sin but Jesus walking in the pool of Bethesda walking past all those that needed him went to one imagine that what everyone everyone was thinking that knew who this man was you're the Healer I don't need this pool you're the one that blessed this pool and he walks right past you you oh man I've prayed and I I don't know why I don't know why I'm I I'm here but you struggle you lack you need something the money is not always making its its ends me you know I I I wholeheartly believe Within Myself Lord if I'm the poorest man on the planet Planet as long as I've got you you know that's got to be more than just a statement we make that's got to be real because when a prophet says even if he sends me to hell I'll love him still I want that to be my testimony regardless of the circumstance and condition I find myself in father I'm attaching myself to you not because of how much you can bless me but because this life only exists because of you you that's why I love you if we chose Partners only for the sake of what they could do for us and it wasn't love what happens when a medical crisis comes about and they can't do that thing anymore then what keeps you we need real love for God that regardless of the trials that I have to face regardless of how tough times get you're still the same I love you more today than I loved you yesterday in the of the trial I love you there was I had a foolish moment the beginning of this year Miss snitch on myself here foolish moment I'm looking I'm like man Lord I I got this idea I want to I want to do this with business I want to do that I had these deals that came to me I said oh it's God that brought me these deals this is the Lord man all this money I'm about to make oh my goodness that's God and right when things seemed as if they were going to hit they were going to strike you know I was in my room alone crying I said Lord I've never lived a life that knew this the fact that you could give this to me Father regardless of whether I have it or not I'll love you and serve you the same see I didn't realize what I was saying because they all fell through not a single one hit now you're standing and said didn't you make that statement you serve me regard wasn't that you that said that was it not you that said Lord if you heal me out of this situation I'll give my entire life to you wasn't it you that said Lord remove this lust from my life and I'll serve you wasn't it you that said Lord if you heal me I'll be in your house every time wasn't it you that said Lord get me out of this relationship Lord and I'll serve you all the days of my life we make all these promises and all these statements but when the rubber meets the road where are we and there I had to confront myself because I made a statement and God challenged that statement do you really love me if you have nothing do you really love me if I if I don't if I don't give you what it is you think is yours we need true leadership one that's not bound by results whether you get them or not but one that completely trust in the headship says Lord you know what's best for me you know the season of my blessing you know the the season of all things and whether he gives it to you or not you love him the same it's not because you do this then I'll love you it's not because no it's Lord I love you that's it why because you first loved me and you purchased my salvation it it moved me so much this morning I I got to find this quote I trust that the church will understand this that we have no right to use our own thinking about things when we become Christians we fully surrender every bit of our mental powers to God and follow after his leading do you know what the end of it all will be yes I'll make a Rapture but how I don't know all I know the one that said I'd make it will guide my feet guide my hands he will be my stay he will be my strength in the times of weakness he's my strength in the times of Sorrow he's my comforter in the times of trial he's my deliverer the same one that made the promise of the end has enough power to get you to the end we need to step back and surrender and say Lord lead me not lead me like this but Lord lead me I have no thoughts no Ambitions no plans outside of what your word says if it can't be found in your word I don't want it I want the kind of leadership that you wake up in the morning you read the word and it said you know I got to call this person and let him know something the Lord has a blessing for this person why because you're now you care about others you're out of your own mind you're out of your own situation and you can start living for other people that's what the word The Life of Christ was living for others leadership brings you to death of self we want to lead so bad but we don't want to die you can't lead nobody if you're still in charge that's right you have to be a man under Authority not a man with authority I'm under Authority I only do that which he tells me to do I only speak that which he tells me to say nothing more and nothing less if we live that kind of a life if Ben would just get out of the way long enough and fully surrendered to God he'd live an overcoming life every day of his life if the musicians would come brother Ram says in paragraph 35 and if a man will just come that close to God that when when you're lost you don't try to find your way back just surrender to him and he'll lead you back don't try to figure it out that's the mental Powers father teach me not to figure things out teach me to just fully trust in you you have the answers you know how I'll get out of this I may not know this may not be oh man isn't the sermon I was expecting this isn't what I I wanted God to speak to me but I think it's high time we all died to what we expect and just fully surrender into what God has planned if we got out of the way long enough and just took what he gave us when he gave us we would live a more peaceful life let's be like the disciples following Christ no thought just fully trusting in his leadership and what he has planned that's a challenge I place for myself and one I ask you to join me with do you want to fully surrender remove all thoughts that you have all expectations you have it's funny we'll give God old tomats if I don't get this job I'm leaving if I don't if you don't give me this I'm gone who brought you here who got you here can he not keep you so what you don't get that job there's one better coming if this is where he wants you regardless of how tough things seem right now this is where you'll see the blessing made manifest in your life make decisions with God in mind not our pockets in mind let's stand let's just pray gracious Heavenly Father Lord I Thank you for a message that's got all the vitamins that this body needs Lord everything I've ever hoped for everything I've Ever Needed everything I've ever wanted is found in your word Lord you gave us a prophet Lord Jesus and he's came with a message from you Lord that showed us how to fight how to walk how to talk how to live he told us never let a negative thought come into your mind only speak positive persevere if God gives you a vision of something don't move if it's with his words you stay right there and you'll see it come to pass he showed us the example time and time again Lord of that unmoving Faith Lord the kind that Abraham had that didn't move Lord and when all was taken from him his wife his baby and he was there alone he felt alone he said the devil couldn't tell me God wasn't real he knew I knew better all he could tell me was that God didn't love me and right when he was about to just say whatever the flesh man desired that leadership on the inside came forth and said the lord giveth the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord father how often that's us Lord things don't work out the way we want and we're just so ready to give up and say I can't go on much longer Lord but father we need that thing on the inside side that rises up and says it's good that I can't go on longer because he's taken me all the way through help us Lord Jesus we want to be fully surrendered Lord if we ever desire to be mature Christians True Believers Lord we've got to learn to deny ourselves Lord help us Lord Jesus not everything that pleases the eyes is meant for you Lord teach us Lord to be content with that which we have Lord teach us Lord truly to be content with what we have father it doesn't hurt to have faith for other things Lord Jesus but father if we can't be faithful in the least we'll never be faithful in much [Music] Lord I Thank you Lord for the people been a blessing to me been a help to me in so many ways father I pray Lord to all those that are in this house tonight that you pour out a blessing upon them that's so special only the way you can do father Lord I pray that a message be sent to them that hits their address Lord exactly where they're at for that's the kind of God we serve Lord I pray that not a single one that's came here with an infirmity in the body may walk out the same Lord I pray father that anybody that has a need dire that before leaving this place the prophet said too many times we just get up and go too fast if we would just linger in the spirit a moment that angel would come by spend a little while with him Jesus help us to not be busy bodies Lord Jesus but to be sensitive to what you're doing Lord we love you Lord Jesus we surrender it all into your hands asking you to have your way father we ask this in the precious mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen [Music] oh because I love him oh you have G life to be I was nothing oh and until you found me oh you have G life to me oh and heart oh and and broken be sa oh and Ru so you di [Applause] on and your [Music] oh it's what I long for oh you have G life to me sing it again oh I will serve oh and because I [Music] loveing oh and you have G to me oh and I was nothing oh and until you found me oh and you have G life to me oh and heart and broken pieces oh and R [Music] and so why you di all every all and your is what I long [Music] for you have [Music] G life to me Hallelujah I trust you enjoy that tonight amen the orinal leadership that's what we want to be returned to It Wasn't Man leading man and it wasn't man trying to lead God it was God leading man you know you that's that was the original Church man has taken it and the prophet will talk about how they've St substituted substituted the leadership of the Holy Spirit and now they have men telling them what they should do oh you should do this you should dress this way you should do if you don't have the Holy Spirit leading you inside that instruction will never be of no good in fact you will find yourself under the law and the only time you'll do it is just when you fear what that man said to you but God is looking for a different kind of leadership the same leadership that he they directed Adam with the same leadership that we saw in Jesus Christ in fact Jesus told them he said it's it's expedient for you that I go because if if I'm here every time something happened you're going to run oh Master what are we going to do Master Cast Away that one do this over here so everything it was a master master but there came a change of leadership on the day of Pentecost where the master who was with them now was in them and and now they didn't need to run and ask because the master was right in them doing the same thing that he did that's the Church of God that's the church that the Lord is looking for men and women that are being empowered and endued with power on from on high wherever they are they are a unit to themselves they are the very Life of Christ being manifested I love what but Ben said it said mention you know and I guess with age you you you kind to kind of come to see this we we have this type of Christianity that's like from a microwave you know you pray two minutes and God will do and it's all about power and demonstration and it's all about you know just power power power well the same God that has power it's the same God who was manifested in the ox it's the same God who was manifested in the spirit of the human he was the same God who manifested himself in the spirit of the eagle the same God who was a lion butam says those four beasts they're the ones that guard the throne in other word God is not looking for us to just be here every time I go on my knees I ask and then it comes to happen then I know God is with me no the the maturity of a Believer is like Shadrach mesach and Abednego whether he saves us or not we'll stand here and will obey the word whatever happens I know is with me the love of God is manifested in the fact that he's already told us he loves us God doesn't need to do one more thing for us to know he loves us he already says it said it so we can go on from here till Rapture and be be completely convinced that he's he loves us he doesn't need to do one more thing but we know he promises goodness will walk with us so we as Believers especially in the end time the maturity of a Believer is though he sends me to hell I'll still love him the maturity of the Believers to come to a place where you know the trials and the things that are encompassing you and everything is to build a character that is fit for you to live tomorrow we read that quote is building you up for what's coming tomorrow he has a place for you he has a role for you to play in the Kingdom the scripture says the J the just shall judge the Earth how can they judge without the character The Life of Christ we saw that character manifested in Christ I do nothing except what the father people mocked him and laughed at him and looked at him and called him all kinds of names he never responded and he just went about the father's business and everything and he was satisfied with the leadership of the father may we tonight be satisfied with that original leadership I really enjoy that just in within my own life I said God let me just be satisfied you know men we live in a time where men don't want to walk alone they just have to have a group of people with them you know all the time and you know your strength is just in numbers when we are many then you are but when you find yourself is that leadership still there you know in church we can do all things are possible but is everything possible when you find yourself it's not just the god of the church is the god of the individual we bring our licks of fires but he wants us to be the same as we are here tonight the same as we find ourselves when we are alone in the world because he promis you will be with us and if it's not in us don't don't take yourself and say oh no we heard it this morning I I it was really striking to myself even when I find myself in my own wrong all the confessions and everything I'm doing is still my own righteousness man is dangerous the heart of man is extremely dangerous now how could could we have ever known all of this except be for the revealed word of God how could we have ever even seen the depths of our own deception except God send a man to come and tell us those things I desire your leadership Lord I don't want anything of myself I want you to lead me to guide me everything I I don't care what men thinks of me all I care about is what you think about me that's my heart's desire is that your heart desire tonight amen let's just invite brother Paul to come here and just pray for us in this miss us tonight I just was encouraged by today and I I trust the word of God spoke to you I I just feel like I just had another
