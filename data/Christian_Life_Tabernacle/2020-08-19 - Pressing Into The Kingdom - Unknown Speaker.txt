the blood of your son may cover us of all uncleanness speak to us now as we commit ourselves back to your hands in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and ask amen amen it's good to be gathered in the house of god amen let's just open our bibles to colossians chapter 3. amen and we're going to read verse 1 through 4 he says if he then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth in on the right hand of god so he's telling us if we are born of christ if we are raised with christ we need to seek those things which are above and it says set your affection on things above and not on things after the earth for ye are dead and your life is head with christ in god said when christ who is our lives who is our life shall appear then shall we appear with him in glory amen also if you could turn to philippians we're going to read two scriptures in philippians let's start with philippians chapter three we're going to start from verse seven it says what what things were gained to me those i count lost for christ he said yeah doubtless and i count all things but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of all things and do count them do count them by done but i may win christ it says but be and be and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being made conform conformable unto his death if by any means that i might attain unto the resurrection of the dead not as though that i've already attained either we're already perfect but i follow after if i may apprehend for what for for which i also i'm apprehended of christ jesus brother and i count not myself to have apprehended but one thing i do one thing i do forget the forget those things which are behind and reach forth unto the things which are before a price toward the mark for the price of the high calling of god in christ jesus let us therefore as let us therefore as many as perfect be dust-minded and this that's where i want to give my thought tonight to to have the same mind he said let's have this mind let's be dust-minded and if anything if anything ye be otherwise minded god shall reveal even this unto you nevertheless where to we have already attained let us walk by the same rule let us mind the same thing amen and let's turn back in philippians chapter 2 verse 5. a very familiar scripture reading it says let this mind be in you which was also in christ whom being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of her servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death and even the death of the cross wherefore god also had highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth and that every thong should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father amen may the lord that blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seeds amen amen man we're not going to try to be too long tonight just a few minutes to say a few words um and and i'll just to profess this i'll say that this is i was uh sunday as our pastor was speaking about thirst and and and i began to just uh i think on uh on this particular verse of the scripture where paul is speaking about pressing towards the mark and as we read that thirst is a painful desire something within your heart and you know if this doesn't happen i'll die and therefore because there was a thirst in him the thirst created the the desire to press on to move forward to to see whatever he was thirsting for achieved and so as we read the paul is speaking here and say that i pray towards the mark of the high calling and and he's basically laying before us that uh he has a goal and an objective in his life he has something that is pressing towards he has something that he wants to see happen but random tells us that a christian is one that has an objective we don't just go through life and i was even thinking you know none of us can sit here and say that success is something you stumble upon by by accident success is something that's carefully planned and something that after you've learned many mistakes and after you know diligently of sick and continue to do after something that's how a person sees success and i believe even as paul was speaking here of course we read the scripture where he speaks it says i don't count myself if i pre-ended yet and and i and i don't even i have this calling and i have this thing that has been presented to me and i know of my own righteousness that i have learned towards by the law and the things that were shown unto me the things that he had believed before and i said now i'm having to take all of that to having to take everything that he had learned by knowledge by law and all of that to put it aside so i can pursue this new uh a righteousness that was by faith that was shown unto me to christ that i may follow after that so he had he was no doubt standing at the place where he was uh realizing that the things which he he learned by the law that the very things which he thought he understood and he went and he himself was uh one who applied those things because the scripture says that even as stephen was being stoned that his clothes were at the feet of uh paul that he was there applying and believing that what he was following was true but yet he come to a place where christ himself came and revealed to him himself to him and he came into the realization that the things that which i was following after was not the real thing and christ revealed himself to him he says paul paul i am christ i am jesus him who that persecuted now paul knew that he was not persecuted he was persecuting the disciples he knew that he was going after these people that he called fanatics and the people which were going around and spreading the gospel and doing all these things in the name of jesus he was following after with the knowledge that he was doing the word of god with the knowledge that what he was doing was the will of god but when he met the pill of fire he came into the realization that all of those things meant absolutely nothing they was going the wrong direction and i believe that this tonight as we as we gather here we we have come to the realization that in some point in our lives we were following things that were of vain glory things that didn't add up to anything and the revelation of christ in our life has caused us to follow after different things and as paul speaks here he says i pressed towards a mark in other words he had a target something that he was trying to attain to this revelation this christ who was revealed to him this jesus whom he was persecuting who made himself known unto him became his target and to the excellency that i may know him more and the power of his resurrection that i may see him reveal it that i may come to the knowledge of him and he he came as he speaks in philippians and other places that i realized that i was dead and i was i was resurrected in christ and the life i live is not mine it's christ alone so he became all about this mark or this revelation that he had received so as we continue on we realized that he it became a preoccupation of his life and and i will say this everything about paul even about his life to that point everything that he had done and everything that he was about all everything that he did in his life everything added to this goal of his that he was running towards everything that he pursued and all his ambitions and everything that he wanted to achieve everything added together to the pressing of this mark that he wanted to see and and and no doubt we could sit here tonight and recognize that uh we could say that paul was a successful christian because we can see where he says i pressed towards the mark and we could see where he went through his life and then later on we read in the bible it talks about where paul himself now is coming it says that i have run my course and i've run my race and i've come to the end of my race and i know a crown of righteousness await for me so in other words we could see where he started and how he started and what he was pressing after and and the desires of his heart to see those things come and what he was winning the success that he wanted to see and after that we see him come to a place where he was uh uh uh he had faith within his heart and a strong belief that everything that he had followed after will reward him with the crown and and we don't have to go through life even as christians we come to the realization that god has not left us to where uh we do all that we can in this life and we live all kinds of life that we want to or we do all the best that we can and at the end we wait for him to wait our efforts and our everything that we did and find out if we actually going to get a crown or not that's not how the bible is written then if we if paul was certain of the crown that was waiting for him we also are sitting here with an assurance and the the bible says that he has given us the holy spirit as the token as only a portion of what we know awaits us on the other side so we can taste of the holy spirit and know that that which is waiting for me on the other side is real in other words we can see the reality of what's coming today the reality of what's await us on the other side we can taste of it today so god is not a god who uh who just waits and and he lets you just run your life and you do what you can and at the end i'll wait and i'll see exactly how you run your race and if you deserve anything and so but random speaks about pressing on towards and he speaks this isn't a message i was not disobedient to the heavenly vision he says i was thinking uh i was thinking that in the natural that i was thinking the natural man went out in the unseen now speaking about the natural man went out in the unseen with his eyes and pulled an atom down out of the sky and he split the atom and the two destroy human a destroy human life and then he says and if the natural man that knows nothing about god and know nothing about god except that he may be converted then he then his souls becomes alive with the supernatural if he could do that in the natural realm he says um what other men of god be doing it says my my friends it says he says my friend the church is is is a far off a far far behind let's pray that god may move uh will move us we'll move his church up the natural man with with this natural resources is getting greater results than the people that are called that are calling themselves christians now he's talking about the natural and i and i i was even recalling how albert randy just types out the countdown about the natural things and we know bharavanam uses the natural type to the spiritual here is a natural man with a natural intelligence he's able to go and pull from the unseen is able to pull down an adamant and know that if i take this and i split it and it causes so many human life to be lost and what i'm saying is able to achieve more than even a man who calls himself a christian so now he says let's press into the unseen the blessings are yours and that's that's and that's for you so he's basically telling us if we want to be successful we have to press into the unseen the the things the elements which are made to make us successful they're not in the same if the the natural man pulls from the unseen i tell you a christian has a whole lot of resources in the unseen in fact is in a place where he's come to an understanding that the very natural world is created by the unseen and everything about us comes from the unseen the scene will not give you anything the scene changes at all time the scene is subject to change at all moment but the unseen is where the reality lies the ending is what makes the scene and and often times we because because it takes us back to the place where where we become the people that judges everything about what we see we can hear and everything but what our pastor was saying last sunday there is a thirst for something else and and and and man without the holy spirit begins to take that thirst and and he tries this in the natural tries alcohol and he tries drugs and it tries this and he tries that why because there's something within himself that's calling for something that's in the unseen man needs deliverance you can't get deliverance from the world you need salvation you can't get salvation from the world you need healing the world doesn't have the healing to offer we need the supernatural the world that's enough for the supernatural it takes a man to go past the scene and drop into the unseen and pull from god something that cannot be seen with the eyes and then when it's manifested then people will know that there's a god who's able to heal there's a god who is able to offer salvation so we have to pull it from the ancient it says it says the hour is here people the time is here is here it says i say this and you and you can bring me a fanatic if you wish to i believe that this indicates the second coming of jesus christ amen for their signs and wonders and the things of it if you are not in the kingdom of god press into it it's telling if you are not you have to press into it and it says it continues on you have press into the kingdom of god press into it surely i would have some knowledge of what i'm speaking of or god will never honor my prayer to do what he what he does it says if you are outside of the kingdom seek christ as your refuge now it says while it's time and while you have the opportunity i tell you this the opportunity is closing up every day we are getting closer and closer every day time is going out and every day the the the the iniquity cup is filling up every day we can see and realize that the time is at hand every day we come to the place where we we actually if we look at it from the scripture at same point we've gone past the time as natural as can speak we've gone past the time that humanly we can think of if we can think what about him says in 1977 how he shot darkness and yeah we are today how dark can it be and how just a man has gone insane and all those things happening it shows that the time is at the very end because the prophet tells us that the the that light light itself it says it takes when the darkness said it is greatest it means that light is about to break up because when light shows up when it begins to come it compresses all the darkness together and the darkest hour is the time before light can show up so he says on it says it was it says i was asked one time by paul and silas it says in the philippian jailers this isn't a message investment it says what can we do to have eternal life he said believe on the lord jesus and down in the house dao if you truly not make believers but believers jesus said signs it says these signs in mark 16 shall follow not maybe but shall follow those who those that believe that if you got faith enough for your own salvation you can also claim your family by faith if you got if you got that kind of faith your faith can help your family doubt and thy house and then it continues on it says and noah it gives the example it says and noah seeing that the father a good man was pouring away his sons and daughters in laws and so forth come pouring away with him bearing the reproach of the word he says you always have to do that the kingdom of god doesn't come without a trial man presses into that kingdom and that's why i want to go with tonight man presses into that kingdom paul is saying i pressed towards the mark of the high calling what is in our mind in other words when when we we have to come to a place where uh uh christianity managed to turn christianity into a book of law a book of understanding into the rules of what you can follow or not follow some have taken it and changed it into a complete disgrace where i'll do nothing and god will just plug me out of this earth and make me a christian when he wants to and i'll go to heaven because he wants to god wants to but there has to be a pressing there has to be a burning desire there has to be something within your heart there has to be a thirst to respond to the call of god there has to be a thirst in other words god doesn't uh your predestination is by god himself none of us here can sit here and point who's predestinated and who's not we don't see it we don't have that ability it's not given to us but what we can save from the kingdom of god that he has given us is men and women that have hearts burning desire to see the manifestation of the supernatural they want to live by the supernatural they want to walk by the supernatural they want to see the promises of god pulled down manifested in their midst they want when they sickness they want to see healing come unfold when the person is lost they want to see the salvation of god those are the elected of god because by the fruits you can know them where people have turned it into just well you know god will do everything and all you have in other words it's it's a painful desire that you feel like if i don't get this i'll die it's not a one-sided effect god works on both hands he's here with his predestination but on the other hand there's a burning desire how can i see this god i want to touch him with my head i want to see him with my face i want to see the manifestation of his kingdom i can't live without it i hate this world i hate what i see in the mirror i want to see him manifest it it cannot be god calling and you're just going about your business and you know god will call when he calls that means you haven't heard the calling when you hear the calling you can't help it everything else the scripture says that the kingdom of god is like a man who finds a precious poll he finds it in a field what does he do he sells everything now i'll say this god sold everything to come and get that pearl and you the owner of the field you sell everything so you can keep the pearl because you know that's the most important thing so he says it says here it says kingdom uh noah the kingdom of god doesn't come with without trials it says man presses into it into the kingdom of god not observation now but it paid for it is saving is saving he says in saving his life we could stay out here and we could stay hours or noah in that so he speaks a year with with no observation it doesn't come with every man can see it it doesn't come in a place where everybody just notices oh i see the kingdom of god no it's within you it's it's that thirst is the kingdom of god calling that verse is the manifestation of the kingdom it's the kingdom of god coming into you and activating itself in order for the work of god to begin it's the kingdom of god coming from inside and pushing all the way outside in order for it to be manifested it's the kingdom god calling and bringing you into this presence to cause you so you can follow his laws and what he has established in the message perseverance it says brother and sister i don't know i don't know when but i'll make it says i'll make my trip to chicago one day it says this may be this may be it but i'm telling you it says in the name of the lord jesus in the name of the lord jesus the gospel is true this is the last day we are living in the shadow of his coming whatever you do press into the kingdom whatever you do press to enter the kingdom and the question i have for us today is what are we pressing after what is it that we are pressing after what is it that that thirst that painful desire what is it causing us to do now we realize that you know the scripture speaks about uh you know uh uh quench not the holy spirit or the the thirst there's a touch within a man that's supposed to be quenched by god himself and by the holy spirit and and as our even as our pastor said last time we what we do is we take the thirst and we begin to feel it we feel like well maybe if i just uh go i'd go do my job and i go do this and even i would even go as far as saying maybe if i just come to church and listen to the word of god then the taste will be filled no the thirst is more than just coming to church the thirst is more than just doing the things that you do every day the first is the fulfillment of god's word within your life the thirst is what causes you to move from where you are and move into the position that god has placed for you the thirst is the very thing that starts everything [Music] without the thirst then we are just robots we're just a bunch of people trying to fulfill whatever we have in our intellect if if we don't desire it if we want painfully desire to see it what good is it for if all we can do is just follow after the letter we we we're not different from the uh uh the scripture speaks about uh uh in the uh the pharisees and the levite and those that worked in the temple because all they did is follow after what their father did all they did is they went into the temple from a young age educated to know the scroll and know everything and repeat it and repeat it now jesus came and looked at them and told them that you are of your father the devil because all that was it was just man effort it was just the flesh it was trying to fulfill a supernatural calling by a natural person there was no thirst and they looked at them and called them you are your father the devil but yeah with these disciples they looked unclean and they ate without washing their hands and they did all kinds of things that people could call them unbelievers but yet within those people there was a trust there was something that desired to see god there was something that wanted to see the manifestation of the holy spirit in the midst so so we realized yes paul speaking here i pressed towards the market paul he says it was his mind it he had this goal within his mind is his level of success if i could say his his level of uh what his contentment uh his success it was measured based on how close he was to his desire uh he is his happiness his ev everything about him was always measure based upon the mark that he had in front of him and and we know but talks about the mark it says that you know when you put it before it says uh it thoughts about shooting it says that that if the error starts here when the mark is off and and and and when something you're trying to aim for when it's off it says it starts right off here but when you go far off it gets further and further in other words it doesn't manifest the things which are taught it would manifest we can look at this world we can look at the church world and everything and realize that they are not manifesting the things which the bible says that would manifest we can look at the condition and realize they are not coming into the fullness of what the scriptures promise the fullness at the end time so here jesus speaks and he continued that paul speaks in and and i was just thinking about jesus i i just thought about he said that it was about his father's business and and no doubt we realized we we we can interpret that he he always followed what what was about his father's interest but we also have to realize that jesus knew that he was part of the father jesus went after the things which benefited the kingdom that he was part of the things which prosper the kingdom from which it came from the things which prosper the things which prosper in the kingdom which it came from he told them that this kingdom he says i'm not of this kingdom it says and if this was my kingdom it says my my soldier my my disciples will come and fight for me it says the angel will come and fight for me but he knew that this was not his kingdom so he worked in order to prosper the kingdom which he was part of that which he was sent to achieve and those things which was that was the desire of his heart when he says the word of god he says even as his disciple came to the well it says oh we brought fruit it says oh i already ate he says what is your way the word of god was his food when he see the word of god come to pass it satisfied his soul it brought heaviness within him he was happy to see those things that was his heart desire that was the thirst that was in him it says i was reading about how he went to be baptized by john and the scripture says that he came to the river jordanian and then and then john in the process began to realize oh that i'm the one who has need to be baptized that i'm the one who has need to be baptized but jesus looked at him and says that i want you to suffer that we may fulfill our righteousness in other words he was about his father's kingdom he wanted to see the scripture fulfilled and the things which were promised about him come to pass to the ladder he wanted to see what which was promising that time come to pass to the letter but random says in the message the fourth seal it says do you know i doubt it says i say 19 of the 19 of the people on earth ever know jesus was here when he was here it says i know when elijah prophesy i doubt where there was hardly anybody know he was it says they know there was a crack up they know they know there was a crack up there some old fanatic but and but they hated him sure he was it was what they they would call it oddball and i think anybody and i think any any born again christian is kind of an oddball it says to the world because you've been changed you've been you are from above you are from another world your spirit your spirit from across the chasm and and these things which is such a mess up thing it said there are no different there's something wrong they are still too earthbound you ought to be heavenly minded heaven lives by the word amen and and i think and i i just want to say this i feel like sometimes we get if i were say to earthly bound and to uh earthly minded by by our thinking and by our approach to things and uh we we let the things of the world affect us easily and and and you know you you think we we pick up calls that are not supposed to be ours we get into things that are not to be ours we we think in the way of the natural man but we forget that we are born from another kingdom we are born in the kingdom of god and we are equipped by the supernatural we are equipped by the unseen of that kingdom for us to manifest it in this world and people hear things and they pick up a cause and they want to see something happen i'll tell you this i believe the best activist there is in this world is a christian because if you are an activist on this world all you're just trying to do is change somebody's mind from one mind to another mind they will just convert you from this group to another group and you'll follow after this group after just go but a christian is the only true activist because he takes you from this kingdom and he takes you into the kingdom of god is the only one who can give you access to something that this world cannot offer to you and bring a real change into your life and give you eternal life that's what we need to press for that we can exchange our natural mind it won't happen it won't help us in anything but oh if we can change heavenly minds if we can share the scripture says faith comes by hearing by the hearing of the word of god and then we put our licks of fire together and we get energized and then the scripture says where two or three i gather under my name i'll come in the midst and then the holy spirit dropped that's where the supernatural happened oftentimes we just come and you know even when songs are going forth and our minds we're still you know we still think about everything that we didn't finish at work all the dishes that await us at home and the things at which we have to go pick up what we left off and i know this is a wednesday service but we get carried into those things away and i want to say this we need to learn to break up out of those things we need to realize that we are of another kingdom one day i watch the last dish and one day i'll clock out for the last time one day oh oh they'll be looking for me and i'll be gone they'll pick up the phone and call hey he's not answering his phone where is he i go to my kingdom i go from where i came from [Applause] brothers and sisters this cannot be the end of us this cannot be what we are looking for this cannot be what our mind is about there has to be something that we can thirst for that's more than what we see paul said that we of all people are the most miserable oh but there's a thirst no wonder the prophet said i hunger and dress for those things said i want to see the kingdom of god come into plain view it doesn't come with observation but how does it come a thirst within your heart time time-tested memorial he speaks about a vision he says i had a he speaks about this man who built the bridge he said he had a vision before a man can have a reputation he has to have a vision of what he's doing he has to have a goal a mark of what he's pressing for oh bless the lord that's the reason we are we are there is a heavenly there is a heaven to go to i love that he says that's the reason why there's a heaven to go to there's a reason we can it says that's the reason we can have a reputation as a christian in other words the heavens to go to justify the reputation that we have here below it says we know that the material is here in the building that's right the blood of jesus is in the building that's right his stained blood has washed away all our sins he took he took me from the alleys of hell and made me his servant then i believe in him so i pray from death to life i pass from death to life and every believer has had did that because they had to go they have they've got the confidence that they believe in this great builder this is a great architect it's the great builder and i want to say this we have to have a desire that thirst has to manifest itself that does cannot just be said well i have a thirst but you do nothing about it you die no no one becomes a doctor by accident you have to put in the work you have to go to school you have to take the classes you have to pass the exams you have to do all of those things no one can become a great engineer by accident oh i just stumble and i now you you may have a gift the talent the things that you love and everything but you got to go through the process you got to take some classes you got to go so you can be what certified so you can be given a seal something that shows that this person has shown that they have the desire to become this but yet the seal shows that the thirst that was in there is fulfilled oh i tell you when we were back there we read about the box card everything everything that you had need of when you received that seal god made sure that it was contained within that seed to take you from here into the heavenly places it's got to be a chance to see that if i need this today that means there's something in here that wants to see this come to pass and then when it comes to pass it takes you to another one it takes you to another one that's how god works but random talks about this young man and thought about the story of the young man who is riding a bicycle with this talented people it says that in the story there's no place where it talks about that he had some type of gift or ability better than the other people in fact that's not what's attributed to him and and and this is goes to show that it's not our talent our ability that god is looking for this young man was only focused to the mark that was put in front of them now in the on the road as they were writing you notice in the story that the others were getting distracted by the things which were calling them left and right by the noise and the things and or by trying to prove something that they were that they were a great writer that they knew more about more than the other people and all those things those are the things that caused the failure and and this one wouldn't seem to have been according to the story the less talented of all got to the finish line and i say this it's not who runs fast it's not who has the ability to produce something it's not who has the ability to show or to explain or to do this but it's here who makes it towards the head by keeping his eyes on the prize by making sure that you have the mark and what's her mouth it's perfection not the perfection that we can achieve on our own but the perfection by the perfect world that we have received by believing the perfect word we automatically becomes perfect you believe that by believing a perfect word you automatically becomes perfect why because the word will work in you and will work on you until it manifests the perfection that is calling for it's not him or honest it's not who does this it's god who shows mercy and if god shows the mercy i'm running with it oftentimes we say to him it's not him who run it and then we don't run we don't do anything no the mercy is given to you so that it's not by the talented one it's not by him who can do this or do that but it's him who stayed with what they've been given those are the ones that get to the finish line he says gracious heavenly father to thee we give praise of all thy goodness and our mercy it says and now quieten us down lord and that we might study the word of the living god as it comes to us through the vision and is confirmed by the holy spirit backed by the bible we pray that will give us understanding that we may know what to do in this last day that we see the evil powers settling around us now the battle the final battle is just about to be fought help us lord israel warriors strong let us keep the shield of faith with the word of god the sword and move forward in jesus name i say that's our prayer you know we're not called to be the mightiest but we're called to just stand we just call whatever we've been given that's what we stand with however measure of phrase we've been given that's what we stand for i was reading but when i'm talking about in the message in the message god has a provided way i believe he speaks about how uh this this this i believe it's the geese so this birds how they take a fly it says all these thoughts think about it the whole community of them all it starts the way it starts it just takes one of them to get the inspiration and it will begin to scream and to scream and to scream and pretty soon they begin to gather together together and they will gather until they take a flight and i say this my brother my sister we have to come to a place where when the word of god is reaching we get burning and and our desire to grow and we begin to gather together and to want to see the word and everything that's how we're going to go home it's not by getting colder it's by getting hotter [Applause] [Music] you can't be backsliding and think i'm just gonna make it no you gotta get hotter you gotta let the word of god make you hard you got to let it strengthen you you got to let it burn within your heart the way you can't stand yourself anymore because that's that's what means that something is happening and it's taking us into the other direction but you see the challenge of it is but venom tells us that that that it's the trouble always comes before the promise shows up the thing about it is trouble is always at the door before the promise shows up you think about the children of israel when the time of the promise began to get near guess what happened somehow they came in pharaoh who didn't know who who joseph was is that a coincidence no it was just means that the time of the promise was near they began to work them hard and to work them hard now pharaoh was doing that thinking that he's doing it for the benefit of his own kingdom but he forget that he was fulfilling god's plan that why because there had to be a thirst a desire within them when they got tired of those breaks and they got tired of what they were doing and they wanted to see god manifested when they were in the upper room they began to cry out they wanted to see the promise come to pass my brother and my sister the rapture will come when we stop burning we want to see god and it's the power of god that will come and manifest the rapture in us oh i got a lot of trouble that's good it just means the promise is somewhere closer it just means it's the fire lighting you up so you can look for the promise something to save you out of your trouble it just means i need something to get me out of this situation that i'm in why because it's the time god has made it to where its situations begin to change the work situation began to change the living situation began to change there were days just settling there the scripture of barbara says that god made them to be farmers and all those things in fact they already had a place predestinated for them yet they are in the bondage yeah they are just making breaks and and all those things now it wasn't that bad when they were making breaks i thought well you know as long as they give a straw there's no issue you know we could still this is the man in the bondage and often time we we we just you know as long as oh as long as it's not too painful it's fine you know you know i'll just take it it's i'll take it it's okay and this happened and you know i'll take it i'll take it the question is when are you not going to be able to take it anymore when is that thirst gonna start where you say i think i've had enough i think i don't want any more of this why what create that it's the choice that god's for cindy you just get to a place i've had enough and i think too many of us have not gotten to a place where we've had enough we're so satisfied when they're satisfied with that we come back up we fall we're okay with it we do this and we go wrong here we go wrong watch it just come to a place where i say i've had enough and i want to see god come to pass [Applause] it says heavenly father we thank thee for gathering together we thank this for this gathering together of men that put in the office that you put in the office here to carry out your work of the lord that's being carried out in jeffersonville in the church it says god may your hand be upon them may you help them and bless them may the congregation and the people understand and know that this is this is to be in better this is to be this is to be in better the kingdom of god that we might become that we might become men of understanding and know the spirit of god and what god and what god and and know what god what and know what god do granted father dismiss us now in the blessed and may the holy spirit watch over us and guide us and protect us and they may be found faithful on the post of duty in jesus christ so now he's speaking is even showing the heart desire we we want to be found right and the only way we could be find right is to be in the pressing mode you know the christian life is not one that you can go and you know punch off the clock and say man i've been a christian for long i just need a break and i feel like that's what some people do they take a break they come in they take a break they go out they come to take a break and you just do that one day you'll take your break and the door will close we can't take a break we are made to be soldiers of the cross whether you get your teeth knocked out whether you get your legs broken you just stay in the bottle but branham says if you can fight him you gum him if you don't have truth whatever you do don't ever give up you are not being created to give up you are made to be an overcomer and overcome it's not strength it's this it's someone with a heart to never give up or thirst something that will eat you up and just never let you give up if the musician could come oftentimes we just walk around and you know we read about the promises of god that he pour out of his spirit in the last day we just rejoice thank god and everything i'll tell you i rejoice but i want to see that spirit i want to say it for myself i want a taste of it i want to taste of it myself i want a taste of it so i can go tell the others i can't go tell the others if i haven't tasted it myself i can't talk about healing if i haven't had it myself i can't talk about salvation if i don't know what he's talking about god is looking for witness he's looking for somebody to taste of this kingdom of hearts to know what it tastes like to know what it means like to know what he always about to taste of it so you can go to battle with it there's a bunch of people talking about the kingdom of god and they hadn't even taste of a piece of him but god is here he's calling he says come come unto me come and i will give you rest in other words i'll take your yoke and i'll give you rest i'll have your taste of my goodness of your taste of what i am i'll tell you i have a taste of my power why because when you go out there talk about my power you know exactly what you're talking about and the people that are pressing for it god will manifest themselves to them because the scripture says to them that are looking for his appearing only those who will come to he didn't come now think about it the fullest version we're not looking for him they heard the call but they said but the wise version when they heard the call they went to seek for all they began to prison they began to press to make sure they had the old they knew that was the requirement then when they showed up they were able to go in with them let's brace in my brother my sister let's not let the kingdom of this whole earth and overtake us and the things of this world overtake us in all things but let's praise for this kingdom the kingdom of god is for those that suffer violence those that want to see god manifesting a painful desire let's all stand let's respond our heads as our pastor come our grace is father we're so thankful for your grace and your mercy lord lord we thank you for the thirst tonight oh father we'll give up everything so we can just have a thirst we ask lord that you just increase that thirst until we can't bear it anymore lord until we can see the fullness of you in us lord lead us and guide us into your righteousness we love you lord everyone gather here everyone at home lord bless them we'll commit everything into your hands and ask us things in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen [Music] amen let's just sing that oh when the violin [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] yes [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] is [Music] strength brother billy brought the word of the lord tonight i i thought in my heart how often do we even consider the supernatural you can't look for something you don't consider you know how how many times do we think to bring the supernatural into our our situation or our our problem maybe you've got a child that's wayward and you know you have all the hope for them but sometimes you just got to sit back and say lord i need a miracle i'm not looking i'm looking for the supernatural i want the supernatural to come i want the supernatural to be there maybe you've got problems and you know you have an enemy fight sometimes you just got to go beyond the realm of your senses brother billy said you got to look into the unseen and say you know what i'm believing a miracle but he said something that was tonight you know he says we do it together [Music] we do it as an army we do it as a body we do it believing together for the supernatural tonight and if we pray together and we believe together and we agree on any one thing it's what comes to pass and maybe you're here tonight and you need something from god maybe you need a a deliverance or a healing or a direction in your life you just need something from the lord tonight something supernatural you don't maybe not even know what it is but you know there's a deep calling to a d and so many times we have a deep calling to deep we go looking for the answer but you can't find it in a carnal realm because it's a spiritual thirst it's got to come from someplace else and and if you're there this evening i or you need prayer tonight maybe you're healing maybe you're out of work maybe that they put you on furlough no matter what it is the problem is that's what's wonderful about the supernatural the supernatural doesn't find its answers in the natural the supernatural finds its answers than the unseen amen so if you have a need tonight and as they play just pick a song billy you think we should listen to or sing and you in your heart want to just take a moment now lift your hand to him [Music] and say lord i i need something supernatural i'm not worthy i don't even know what it is because it comes from a realm that is beyond my comprehension and i'm asking you tonight too meet my need whether it be healing whether it be deliverance from a habit whether it be the holy spirit whatever it might be right now lord i'm i'm looking to the i'm looking outside this dimension i'm looking outside my senses i'm looking outside the world around me i'm looking past the stars and past the clouds i'm looking into heavenly lord and i'm placing my need at your throne tonight and i'm believing father that because your word said if i would ask that i would receive your word said that if i cast my cares upon you that you careth for me your word said if i ask in no wise would i be turned away so father tonight i'm i'm coming to you the brother tonight preached about a thirst for a power a thirst for a supernatural and i've come to that place lord that i need the supernatural in my life and i'm coming to that fountain tonight you have that in your heart tonight if you want physical prayer tonight we'll be happy to lay hands on you and pray with you if it would help you you don't need it but if it would help you we're willing to do that tonight but let's don't walk out of here without getting a taste of what our brother preached about amen we'll sing this song in case there's anyone that needs fruit help me sing it holding your hand [Music] is [Music] [Applause] yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] man [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is
