Description:
Sunday Evening Service 
Pastor David McGeary Sr.
Christian Life Tabernacle
October 5th, 2025
Bedford, Texas

The church body of Christian Life Tabernacle began in 1978 when David McGeary moved to Texas from Arizona and began pastoring a small group of believer
 in Haltom City. Presently located in Bedford, Christian Life Tabernacle is a City set on a Hill in the middle of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area.

Christian Life strives to be a witness to the DFW area by proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus Christ that has been restored in its fullness by God through His servant William Marion Branham. As an angel messenger to the Gentile church age described in Revelation 3:14-22, this Prophet’s Message was supernaturally vindicated by God to be the Truth, and ministered an exodus from the creeds and doctrines of this Laodicean church world.

"Not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me, or join my church, or start some fellowship and organization. I have never done that and will not do that now. I have no interest in those things, but I do have an interest in the things of God and people, and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied. That one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and men, wherein men become new creations in Christ, filled with His Spirit and live according to His Word. I would invite, plead and warn all to hear His voice at this time, and yield your lives completely to Him, even as I trust in my heart that I have given my all to Him. God bless you, and may His coming rejoice your heart." - William Branham

And that's why we can't look at somebody else and say, "Why don't you get it?" Because we know we didn't get it by ourselves. It was him bringing his word to come to pass in our lives. Amen. Amen.

By the way, if you could just come and take this needs before the church, wonderful father, Lord Jesus, so thankful, Lord, to know that you're still the God that answers prayers, Lord Jesus. With all that goes on in this world, the chaos and turmoil, Lord Jesus, you still show up on time. Father, moved in my heart, Lord Jesus. There's no ground we can stand on made by man, Lord Jesus, for it's not a firm foundation, Lord. But you've told us to stand on you, Lord Jesus, the solid rock. All of the ground is sinking sand, Lord Jesus. As your children have gathered in your house tonight, Lord Jesus, on this communion night, the sacrifice that was made to be here, Lord Jesus. Father, I pray a special blessing may be given to each one, Lord, that sacrifice to be here, Father. And for those that had a desire to be here but couldn't make it here, whether it was by means, Lord Jesus, or wellness and body, Lord, Father, I pray a special blessing towards them, Lord Jesus. For your prophet said a desire to serve you is greater than anything the devil has to offer. And if a heart desires to be in your house, Lord, it's your promise for them to be here, Lord Jesus. Father, I pray you open up paths and ways that they might be able to enter into this house when the doors are open. Father, it's a special time when we gather together. Lord, prayers are answered, deliverance comes forth, healing is given, souls are saved, Lord Jesus. Father, we don't want to get too comfortable, Lord Jesus, to accustomed to moments like these, Lord. At any given moment, it could be the last one. Lord Jesus, we may not make it past the end of this service. Lord Jesus, if we had our hearts exactly like those of our fathers who were earnestly expecting for you to come at any moment, Father, lived every day with the hope that you'd be coming back in their time, Lord Jesus. But because of your prophet, we know it's in this hour, Lord, that you will make your return, Father. Lord, how much more are our hearts hungering and thirsting to see your coming, Lord Jesus, to take us so that we can go with you, Lord. Father, open up our hearts, Lord Jesus. Let us lay aside all weights, Lord Jesus. Anger, strife, disagreements, bitterness, Lord Jesus, that doesn't belong in our hearts, Lord Jesus. It doesn't belong around us, Father. Have your way in the service, Lord Jesus. I pray for our pastor, Lord, who gets ready to bring forth the word, Lord Jesus. Bless him, Lord Jesus. And for the tithes and offerings, Lord, I pray a special blessing over them. Bless the hands that have given, Father. And for those that desire, we heard you. Grant jobs, Lord. Grant jobs to those that have a heart to give but aren't able to, Lord, that they might be able to give. Father, we thank you. We leave the remainder of the service into your hands asking you to have the preeminence. Lord, you saw every lifted hand, Lord Jesus. Father, may all hands that were lifted leave with an answer, Lord Jesus. There's nothing too great for you, Father. One word that touches one person touches another in a different way. I truly believe from the bottom of my heart that every person can leave here changed. Father, just have your way. Father, we leave our own man's expectation out the way and we leave the room for the word to have its way. Do what you see fit. Father, we ask this in your precious, mighty, and wonderful name. Amen. And we'll we'll have a baptism. Let's just sing that as we get ready for the baptism tonight. I know who I am. I know who you are. Oh, the cross of salvation was all in her side. Now I am chosen, free and forgiven. Oh, when I have a future and it's worth delivering. I was an angel stand in the grave. I was called by him. Born raised back to life. I was made for more. Why would I make a bed in my shame when the fountain of is running my way? I know I am yours. I was made. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a great blessing that goes with baptism. &gt;&gt; And that's what I like about being every time someone gets baptized, I get &gt;&gt; you know, we can truly say, enter into the joy of the Lord. and our brothers chose to be baptism at his own accord. He's prayed through. He's thought about it. He went through all the man baptist and he decided he wanted to give his heart to the &gt;&gt; give a quick testimony then we'll baptize. &gt;&gt; First thing I want to say, thank you Lord Jesus Christ for the blessing for let me give my life to him. &gt;&gt; Uh I've been thinking about it for a long time. My mom has been asking me for a long time as well. And I just um want to say that I will try to be the best and we're all human. We all make mistakes. But um I just want to be the best um soldier of God possible. &gt;&gt; So thank you for all the blessings. I praise God more than I can count. I think for God's &gt;&gt; that's the way you approach it, isn't it? &gt;&gt; I'm going to be the best soldier. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That I can Let's read in our scriptures. It says, "Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made the same Jesus, whom he hath crucified, both Lord and Christ." Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For this promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as our Lord God shall call." And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, "Save yourselves from this up towards generation." And they that gladly received his word were baptized. And the same day they were added unto them about 3,000 souls. and their and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and the breaking of bread in and in pray. Amen. So, we're going to baptize our brother. He said, "Why did we decide right to baptize him in the middle of song service?" because I wanted him to have communion baptizing it. And after we baptize him, I think brother, we have a lot of good things ahead of us this evening. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Believe he loves you. Amen. Brother, it's going to be a privilege to baptize you. As we heard in the word, we're carrying out the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're perfor actually performing exactly what the word told us to do. We've went into all the world and we've preached the gospel and you've heard the gospel and we're baptizing you in the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost which by divine revelation and Peter having the keys to the kingdom said that name was the Lord Jesus Christ and according to the word of God according to your testimony we baptize you for the remission of your sins that you might receive the Holy Ghost. So we baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [Music] [Applause] Amen. Um, brother Jeff had a request as is he's in desperate need of a job and we just want to pray that the Lord will grant him one. Amen. I know we just read a testimony about this morning of one that got a job and this afternoon about one and I believe the Lord will do that. Amen. Let's just bow heads. Gracious Father, you said that whatever we had need of, Lord, that you will provide. You said that look at the flowers, look at the little bird, Lord, Father, if you provided them, how much more us, Lord, that are created in your image. We pray, Lord, that you may just grant off the brother what he has need of, Lord, in order for him to live. And we commit him into your hands and ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. Amen. But Orlando has a special and then after that, Sister Tamar will bring hers. Amen. Let's just sing that song we were singing in F. Amen. Amen. I wasn't made to be standing a grave. I was called my name [Music] raised back to life. I was faithful.

If it's possible, [Music] let it pass me by. for a new time of great trials and testings. If you believe in what is one is saying. [Music] This is what you heard him say. For you, oh God, I am with you. It's only to bring out my life through you. Some through the waters, some through the flood, some through the fires, but all through the blood. You run for the price.

When Satan comes to move you from your place, you will know that your mighty God will fight for you. And you will say, Satan, none of these things can move me. Neither God my life did to me.

We're so grateful for that this evening. We ask, Father, that you would continue to set our hearts on fire, Lord, that we would take hold of the commission to go share with the world what that you have done for us, knowing that you are life, you are hope. You are our salvation out of this dying world. and that on soon you'll come to receive us that we can be where you are also. We ask you to bless us tonight in Jesus precious and wonderful name we pray. Amen. And amen. God bless you. Let's open our Bibles this evening to the book of Corinthians in the 11th chapter and the 23rd verse. You know, it's it's so good to uh do the word of God even with footwashing. He told us, he said, "If you do these things, happy are you." A amen. So, uh I I'm just so grateful to do this this evening because it makes me happy. And you say, "Well, why does it make you happy?" Because the word said it would make me happy. And that settles it, right? God said so. &gt;&gt; That settles it. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's read here together. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he took he was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, "Take, eat. This is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me. And after the same manner also he took the cup when he had sucked, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood. This do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me. For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you do show the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eateth this bread and drinkkeeth this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinkkeeth unworthily shall eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Wherefore, my brother, when you come together to eat, tear one for another, and if any man hunger, let him eat at home, that ye come not together unto condemnation, and the rest will I set in order when I come. Amen. What a a wonderful opportunity. You know, our messenger spoke a lot of things about communion and it, you know, it's actually getting to a place where people aren't having communion anymore and they're not having footwashing anymore. But I'm glad that we can read it in the word and we can perform it and have the blessings of it. So God bless you if the brothers would come at this time. And as we pray, you pray. If you have a petition, make it known to the Lord. You know, there's deliverance in communion. There's healing in communion you and he sees you fulfilling his word and he knows what you have need of &gt;&gt; and he'll pass that blessing onto you. He really cares for us &gt;&gt; and that's what's wonderful. &gt;&gt; He really wants the best for us &gt;&gt; and he's here to fight and so let us let us scripture says for another. Let us hold each other up in faith that God can do for us exceedingly and abundantly even above that which we can ask or think. Our gracious heavenly father. Lord, we look upon communion this evening. We see this broken bread, Lord, representing your body. And Father, a body that we're all members of in particular, Father, that you're the head of and Father, we take communion signifying that we're a part of this body. We bear the burdens of the body and we nourish one another as the body, each member in particular nourishes the other. &gt;&gt; Father, as we heard this morning that your bread is spiritual food, Father, it's meant to be taken and eaten. And as you said, this is my body. I take, eat. And Father, it's the New Testament. And Father, we know that it's food indeed. And we're so grateful, Father. And Father, the cups that represent your blood that was shed for the remission of our sins that the life and the blood could return back on the believer. Father, we're so grateful for that. And now we ask you to bless it to us, Father, as each of us come take communion individually, fellowshipping with you, laying our burdens at your feet, knowing that you care for us. And Father, we desire to care for you. We ask you to bless us now this evening in Jesus precious name we pray. Amen. Bless you, musicians. [Music] God bless you. May come take communion as you feel led. God bless you. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] All right. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. Let's stand together. We'll read it. Can we sing that song? I think you were playing it early. Jesus is here. The first Amen. You believe that? You say, "Well, I don't feel him. He said he'd be here. [Music] &gt;&gt; Maybe if you just look for him or ask him to make himself known to you. You know, our prophet preached. He said that you'll get what you expect. &gt;&gt; If you come to criticize, he said there'll plenty to criticize. Amen. But if you come to touch him, his garment is here to be touched. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing this as we prepare our hearts. Oh, how do you explain? How do you cry? A love that goes from east to west. [Music] Oh, you know all our fears [Music] and words cannot express the love we feel but we long for you to hear. So listen to our hearts. Hear our spirit. A song of praise and [Music] from those who have redeemed. We will use the words we know to tell you what awome God you are. The words are not enough. Listen to my heart. &gt;&gt; If words can fall, I pray from these. [Music] And if I had a thousand years, I would still run out of time. If you listen to my heart every sing, [Music] thank you for the truth. Thank you for the way. Listen to our hearts. [Music] Hear our spirit sing. See our praise and flow from those who have redeemed. We will use the words we love. to tell you what an awesome God [Music] [Music] &gt;&gt; that one that says sickness can't be with us any longer. I think that's called Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; Huh? &gt;&gt; Healing's here. How many believes that? Amen. Every part that he has to offer is here because he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. You know, you you don't know how great the love of God was. We had our youth meeting just here uh I guess just a month or so ago. This weekend, Brother Andrew went to Colorado to preach the funeral of a 15year-old boy, I believe. Right, Andrew? &gt;&gt; 16. &gt;&gt; He had turned 16 in August. &gt;&gt; Just turned 16 years old in August. And some people called him out of his house and he went out of his house and they shot him dead, 15 years old. He was here for our youth meetings and now he's no more with us in this life. I just pray to God that something down in those meetings anchored in his heart. But we know he's here to heal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We know he's here to deliver. &gt;&gt; And I think if we could ever be so conscious, the prophet of God said that people do the things they do because they feel they're out of the presence of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But how much more would it be for us if we could recognize that presence? &gt;&gt; That's right. and recognize he's here to do for us exceedingly and abundantly above what we could ever ask or think. He's here to bear your burdens. He's here to break the chains. He's here to answer the questions of your heart. He's here to throw our sins in the sea of God's forgetfulness. He's here to let us know he's here. and he's here for you. Proble God said he could have bypassed coming to this earth. &gt;&gt; He didn't have to come down here and die. But he came here so that we would have a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For our sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. that our accountability fell on him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'll be accountable for their sins. I'll take the punishment for their sins. I'll pay the price." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For their sins. &gt;&gt; Let it all fall upon me. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just think of it. And then he comes to back in in our midst and he says, "I'm here to lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness. I'll for not forsake you, but I'll come again. I will not leave you comfortless, but I'll come again and I'll be with you even in you till the end." He's here. Let's just sing this knowing that he's here. And let's before we wash one another's feet, let's just invite him into our heart. That the love of God would flow amongst ourselves one to another. And that he said that he'd rather see us love one another. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] Healing Jesus [Music] and I receive it. For healing is healing. [Music] Healing is here [Music] and I believe. [Music] Reach my hand to the heaven. I lift my eyes through my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my heer. Trust in you.

You are the God of all power and it is your will that I reach my hands to the lift my eyes where my help comes from. I look to you, my rock, my healer, I trust you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As we read in the 13th chapter of the Gospel of St. John. Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come, that he should depart out of this world unto the Father. Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them until the end. And supper being ended, the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas's Scariot, Simon's son, to betray him. Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God. And he raised from supper and laid aside his garment and took a towel and girdeth himself. And after that he pth water into a basin and begin to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Then cometh he to Simon Peter. And Peter said unto him, Lord, dust thou wash my feet? Jesus answered and said unto him, "What I do, thou knowest not now, but thou shalt know hereafter." Peter said unto him, "Thou shalt never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me." Peter changed his tune. Simon Peter said unto him,"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head." Jesus said to him, "He that is washed needeth not safe to wash his feet, but is clean everywhere. And ye are clean, but not all." For he knew who should betray him. Therefore said he, "Ye are not all clean." So after he had washed their feet and taken his garments and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you? You call me Master and Lord, and ye say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you ought you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto you, the servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him. If you know these things, happy are ye if you do them. Isn't footwashing so amazingly plain? &gt;&gt; And yet it's such a hard thing for man to do and this modern generation. But I'm glad we can wash one another's feet. God bless you, sisters. Go to your places. Help with the children. Brothers will prepare for here. Thank you. [Music] [Music] [Music]
