[42:44] offering this morning and also again our
[42:47] our condolences go out to brother Cosman

[43:06] dollars in offering this morning for the
[43:09] family
[43:10] um which I just appreciate the
[43:13] generosity poured out
[43:15] from your hearts many of you have asked
[43:19] if there's a way that you can
[43:21] uh
[43:23] give
[43:24] by credit card and we do have a some
[43:29] form of application online we have an
[43:32] app online I think if you go online
[43:35] there's a way to
[43:37] give your offering by credit card
[43:40] and we will take that and turn that into
[43:43] cash to give it to them so
[43:47] um
[43:48] I'm not very familiar with the app but
[43:51] you could talk to one of the trustees or
[43:54] deacons and they'll do your best
[43:58] I'm getting it here on my board
[44:01] technology oh there it is on your board
[44:04] too so there's a place you can go to
[44:07] online in this Christian Life Tabernacle
[44:09] and it'll have it
[44:11] a place where you can give offering just
[44:13] Market benevolence or or whatever and
[44:16] we'll know that what it's for

[44:26] could ever grasp the love that he has
[44:28] for us
[44:30] everything that
[44:31] he does for us is because he loves us
[44:35] and it's always for our good

[44:40] times he will guide us

[49:12] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:13] Christ amen amen God bless you just
[49:16] let's open our scripture we're certainly
[49:18] happy to be gathered once again in the
[49:20] house of God let's read and uh open our
[49:23] Bibles in second Corinthians chapter
[49:25] five
[49:42] we'll start from the 17th verse
[49:47] it says therefore If any man be in
[49:49] Christ he is a new creature old things
[49:52] will pass away behold all things are
[49:55] become new
[49:56] and all things are of God who had
[50:00] reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ
[50:03] and has given unto us the ministry of
[50:07] reconciliation to it that God was in
[50:11] Christ reconciling the will to himself
[50:13] not imputing the trespass unto them and
[50:17] had committed unto us the word of
[50:19] reconciliation it says now then we are
[50:23] ambassadors of Christ as though God did
[50:27] beseech You by us we pray you in Christ
[50:31] that be ye be reconciled to God for he
[50:36] had made him to be sin for us who known
[50:41] who know no sin that we might be made to
[50:44] righteousness of God in him
[50:48] I mean I saw the scripture we read last
[50:50] time Philippians chapter 2 verse we're
[50:53] going to start from 5 verse 5 to 11.
[50:58] it says let this mind be in you which
[51:00] was also in Christ
[51:02] whom being in the form of God taught it
[51:05] not robbery to be equal with God
[51:07] but made himself of no reputation and
[51:11] took upon himself the form of a servant
[51:14] and was made in likeness of man and
[51:18] being found in fashion as a man he
[51:19] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[51:22] death even the death of of the Cross
[51:25] wherefore God also had highly exalted
[51:29] him and given him a name which is above
[51:32] every name that at the name of Jesus
[51:36] every knee should bow of things in
[51:39] heaven and things in the earth and
[51:42] things under the Earth and that every
[51:44] tongue should confess that Jesus Christ
[51:47] is Lord to the glory of God the Father
[51:51] father we ask you once again that you
[51:53] bless your word to us we ask it in Jesus
[51:55] name amen let me have your seats tonight
[52:01] certainly enjoy the word tonight this
[52:03] morning and uh certainly uh
[52:06] perhaps I believe you will be on the
[52:08] same lines of what was spoken this
[52:10] morning I just want to uh what was the
[52:14] things that are quick in my heart amen
[52:17] um I want to I know I was I spoke on
[52:20] identifying with the word last time I

[52:24] real you
[52:26] and it's as identifying with the real
[52:28] you we as we said last time we we live
[52:32] in a time of identification and the time
[52:35] where identification is very important
[52:37] and we said it you couldn't do anything
[52:39] legal at least
[52:42] um whether it be driving going to the
[52:44] banks or or anything without proper
[52:47] identification you you everywhere you go
[52:50] you need to have a proper identification
[52:53] to be identified and says this is the
[52:57] age of identification he called it and
[52:59] and I want to say this just to kind of
[53:02] take the uh directions that I would like
[53:05] to go this tonight that identification
[53:09] is a process that requires something to
[53:12] match
[53:13] um you would think if we speak of
[53:15] identification perhaps me presenting
[53:18] some documents to you or giving you some
[53:21] piece of information in order for that
[53:23] to be identified to be true there has to
[53:26] somewhere that you can validate that if
[53:29] I say my name was Billy you would want
[53:31] to and I said I was born in Africa in
[53:33] Congo and I would give you information
[53:36] and for you to validate that that's what
[53:38] I am you would need some form of
[53:40] identification you'll need to see my
[53:42] birth certificate my driver license or
[53:44] something you need some uh if I would
[53:47] call it some uh um
[53:50] government document or some Source uh uh
[53:55] that could validate that you need
[53:57] something almost like an absolute that
[54:00] you wouldn't doubt you would go when
[54:02] they ask you for identification you
[54:03] can't take a piece of paper write your
[54:05] name and give and say this is my
[54:06] identification no they need they will
[54:08] ask you for a government issue ID
[54:10] because they trust the government and
[54:13] they know in order for you to get this
[54:15] it will have to be validated for you to
[54:17] be to have it in your hands it will have
[54:19] to be you so therefore we have to
[54:22] realize we cannot be Christians
[54:23] according to our own thinking
[54:26] we cannot be Christians according to our
[54:28] own minds or our own understanding or
[54:31] our own definition of what Christian is
[54:33] our Christian why we call ourselves when
[54:36] we call ourselves a Christian there has
[54:37] to be some defining uh identification
[54:40] that shows that you're a Christian we
[54:43] have to have an absolute and we know the
[54:45] absolute that we have received is the
[54:47] word of God
[54:48] we cannot be Christians according to our
[54:51] own understanding that's why we have
[54:52] churches all around the corner you go
[54:54] this way there's one you go that way
[54:56] there's another one what is it it's
[54:58] man's explanation of what a Christian
[55:00] should be and they have them uh
[55:02] according but when I'm saying some have
[55:05] a code of conduct on what it should
[55:06] Christians should do and what they ought
[55:09] to be and all of those things and they
[55:10] take those and if you fill up all those
[55:13] requirements therefore you are
[55:14] considered Christians men go into the
[55:16] Bible they they take their own
[55:19] understanding of the Bible and they come
[55:21] forth and they say this is what a
[55:23] Christian should be and I want to say
[55:25] this there's always two forms perhaps
[55:27] there are more but this is just uh if
[55:30] you allow me to kind of just go forward
[55:32] with whatever was on my heart there's
[55:35] two ways to be identified one of them is
[55:38] the identification that comes by the way
[55:41] of Conformity which is one who went goes
[55:44] and and he reads what a Christian should
[55:46] be in the Bible and they try to practice
[55:48] it by the best they can and try to
[55:51] follow what those things are but there's
[55:53] also another identification that comes
[55:56] by the transformation which means we
[55:59] have gathered here we receive the word
[56:01] of God and the word that we have
[56:03] received does the transformation inside
[56:06] of you to produce what God is looking
[56:09] for so we don't want to be a Christian
[56:11] that's just one that conforms and and
[56:13] wonder will just hear and say well I
[56:16] cannot be that how can I be that but
[56:18] what the prophet is telling us it's
[56:19] important that we are those people that
[56:22] are being transformed by the word of God
[56:24] by the power of God and by the spirit of
[56:27] God the purpose why we come to church is
[56:29] to hear the word of God but that's not
[56:32] the end of it you have to allow the
[56:34] spirit that spoke the word to come upon
[56:37] you and bring that word to come to pass
[56:39] oh I'll tell you this there's many of us
[56:42] that's been here you can testify how
[56:44] many times you've tried to be a
[56:46] Christian by yourself you hear God
[56:48] saying that you can't drink you can't
[56:50] smoke and you try to practice it and
[56:53] your practice will only get you as far
[56:55] you're doing when you're doing by Your
[56:57] Own Strength will only take you as far
[56:59] but when you get transformed by the word
[57:02] that you have received you will never
[57:04] thirst anymore like Jesus told the woman
[57:06] at the well and that's why we desire
[57:08] When We Gather here we don't want to be
[57:10] uh clones of one another we don't want
[57:13] to be those that will just hear and say
[57:15] well I'm gonna go try to practice but we
[57:17] want to be those that have gone through
[57:18] the power of transformation of the word
[57:21] that we have received
[57:23] so therefore we we we we know we can
[57:27] even I can say as we sit here we have
[57:30] been identified as a specific group of
[57:34] people in the end time we have not
[57:36] called to just say we have received the
[57:38] message we may not call to just say well
[57:40] I like the message or I Hear What I Hear
[57:43] or I like this I like that no we have
[57:45] been identified to play a specific role
[57:48] according to the word of the hour we
[57:51] have need not been called to be part of
[57:53] the Baptist or the Pentecost so the the
[57:55] Presbyterian and all we have been called
[57:58] to be a member of the bride and in order
[58:01] for us to fit that qualification we have
[58:03] to receive the word that brings those
[58:07] quality out of us yeah
[58:12] oftentimes people will go in the Bible
[58:15] and we'll go we'll read it says well you
[58:17] know the bride will be there said and
[58:19] everybody wants to say well I'm this I'm
[58:21] this but you have to allow that word
[58:24] that spoke that you have to allow the
[58:26] God who put the promise he himself to
[58:29] come and vindicate and bring the promise
[58:31] to you why is it important because it
[58:34] because as we sit here you cannot go
[58:37] away you don't know where you're going
[58:40] if if you don't if you don't know where
[58:42] you're going then everywhere is your
[58:44] destination
[58:45] but you have to know what is it that I'm
[58:48] looking for what is my direction what is
[58:51] it that has been shown to me what is it
[58:53] that has been revealed to me and I want
[58:55] to say this it's not by understanding
[58:58] it's by Revelation because I say this
[59:01] Revelation comes off in time there is
[59:03] lack of understanding in our part we
[59:05] look at it we know the prophet said it
[59:08] we don't understand it but we believe
[59:09] what the prophet said God is the one who
[59:12] brings the understanding God is the one
[59:14] who brings the light he's the one who
[59:16] makes the path what what if what we've
[59:18] been called to do is to walk upon the
[59:21] footsteps that has been laid before us
[59:23] with confidence knowing that the God who
[59:25] gave the word the God the same God will
[59:27] bring light in our path so we can
[59:30] understand where we're going otherwise
[59:32] we just have our own interpretation that
[59:34] we're walking by
[59:37] and and brother Branham speaks about
[59:39] this and as we speak about this
[59:41] identification he helps us so we know in
[59:44] what direction we were going he he
[59:46] speaks about
[59:48] um I'll just read it for the sake of
[59:49] understanding I just I was going to say
[59:51] it but I thought reading it will just
[59:53] give it a richer meaning he speaks about
[59:55] that the Chinese laundrymen how they
[59:58] would come to this country they didn't
[59:59] know how to read they didn't know how to
[1:00:01] write and he says oftentimes they'll
[1:00:03] take a piece of paper and tear it in too
[1:00:05] and then he says this whole Chinese
[1:00:07] laundroman he will used to come here in
[1:00:10] Arizona and California if you can
[1:00:12] project it is the uh uh the identified
[1:00:15] Masterpiece preaching December 5th 1964.
[1:00:18] he says this old Chinese Laundry man he
[1:00:21] used to come here to Arizona in
[1:00:23] California years ago he says they
[1:00:25] couldn't write one word of English he
[1:00:28] hardly knew it he says you will take
[1:00:30] your laundry to him you know what he
[1:00:32] will do he had a little piece of paper
[1:00:34] he says nothing wrote on it at all he
[1:00:37] said he would just tear it into uh the
[1:00:40] piece of paper and give you one piece it
[1:00:43] says when you come back that piece of
[1:00:46] paper had too much his piece of paper
[1:00:49] it says and he didn't get or you didn't
[1:00:52] get your laundry I said that's a whole
[1:00:54] lot better it says you can't you you
[1:00:57] could copy a name but you can't you you
[1:01:00] ain't gonna fool him there because that
[1:01:03] piece of paper has to match exactly with
[1:01:06] his piece of paper he says that's the
[1:01:09] way God made his Covenant too I want you
[1:01:12] to listen our experience is not to match
[1:01:15] some Creed some Dogma some church
[1:01:18] denomination it's to match the God's
[1:01:21] word so when we gather here the only
[1:01:24] piece of paper that we are interested in
[1:01:26] matching is God's word the only piece of
[1:01:29] paper or the only thing that we're
[1:01:31] interested in matching in what was what
[1:01:33] was in the beginning what was spoken
[1:01:34] about us the only thing we're interested
[1:01:37] in matching is what is it that I'm here
[1:01:39] to do and why am I placed here on Earth
[1:01:41] is to match what was spoken about me so
[1:01:44] I can match it he says you so they can
[1:01:47] match the word of God Jesus Christ right
[1:01:49] when you come to Christ then then Christ
[1:01:53] claims us he tore him into two at
[1:01:56] Calvary part of him he lifted up it says
[1:01:59] and he sits on the right hand
[1:02:02] which was his body the Spirit came sent
[1:02:06] back here to make the bride for him
[1:02:11] to make the bride for him so the bride
[1:02:14] is not made out of some other material
[1:02:17] some other understanding some other
[1:02:19] things the bride is made out of the same
[1:02:22] material as the bridegroom the bride is
[1:02:25] the copy or exactly made out of it's the
[1:02:28] same as Eve was made out of Adam so is
[1:02:31] the bright Indian time
[1:02:33] and now he says he says it says and um
[1:02:37] it says and that same experience that
[1:02:40] was in Christ has to be in US
[1:02:44] that same experience that was in Christ
[1:02:46] has to be in us and I want to say this
[1:02:49] when when Elijah was given the mantle of
[1:02:52] of Elisha when Elijah Elisha was given
[1:02:55] the mental Elisha he was told to drink
[1:02:57] it and to dress it exactly the way it
[1:03:00] was but when I'm speaking extensively on
[1:03:03] that he said he didn't it wasn't given
[1:03:05] so he can go and cut it upon according
[1:03:08] to his own specification which is what
[1:03:10] uh uh we find out happens most of the
[1:03:13] time people will take the word and and
[1:03:15] they will cut this off and they'll cut
[1:03:17] that offer or they will take only the
[1:03:19] peace that sounds to to be good for
[1:03:21] their men and they will take so they can
[1:03:23] justify their position and that one and
[1:03:25] this one but the word is calling us to a
[1:03:28] place where we take the whole word of
[1:03:30] God like we heard it this morning to
[1:03:32] believe the whole word of God and to
[1:03:34] know what is it where is he taking me
[1:03:38] because it's important as Believers we
[1:03:41] know where we're going
[1:03:43] how are we going to get there and what
[1:03:45] God has provided to get us there
[1:03:49] so he says
[1:03:51] he was he was absolutely he was
[1:03:54] absolutely so perfect till he pleased
[1:03:57] the sculpture and and inspired him so
[1:04:01] much until he smorted at Calvary he says
[1:04:04] oh my now we see him in the script as we
[1:04:08] see him as the scripture says God's
[1:04:11] Masterpiece we see him smitten stricken
[1:04:14] Afflicted of God there's a real
[1:04:17] Masterpiece as Angelo as Angelo Struck
[1:04:20] it that's that's what made it so here he
[1:04:24] is and now we it's bringing us to an
[1:04:26] understanding he has to match something
[1:04:28] he's bringing us into the understanding
[1:04:30] we are here to match something we are
[1:04:33] not here to make ourselves what we want
[1:04:35] to be we are here to match what God has
[1:04:38] spoken us to be in the same time now I
[1:04:41] as our pastor was preaching this morning
[1:04:43] I thought this uh if I could just for a
[1:04:46] moment this really uh spoke to my heart
[1:04:49] and I could just bring it uh to an
[1:04:52] understanding it's important and if we
[1:04:55] can just understand this for this moment
[1:04:57] it's important that we we know that we
[1:05:00] are anchored into the word of God
[1:05:05] yes we are it's important that that that
[1:05:09] we are helped to know our anchor is the
[1:05:12] word of God
[1:05:14] and and this is important even for young
[1:05:16] Christians because
[1:05:18] there's days where you walk up where you
[1:05:21] feel like you are an unbeliever
[1:05:23] there's days where you walk up you don't
[1:05:25] feel like this Mighty Christian that
[1:05:27] just went through a great meeting and
[1:05:29] that's on top of the mountain about to
[1:05:31] conquer the world there are days where
[1:05:33] you walk up you feel like the ranked
[1:05:35] sinner you feel like you're the worst
[1:05:37] person on the face of the Earth and that
[1:05:39] should not be your determination of what
[1:05:41] you are whether you are a Christian or
[1:05:43] not a Christian your determination has
[1:05:46] to be what God has promised what God has
[1:05:49] said a Christian should be and what you
[1:05:51] know he said in his word so as long as
[1:05:54] the word says you are a Christian then
[1:05:55] you have to believe that
[1:05:58] it's important as we come we say it's
[1:06:02] not because I shouted that's what makes
[1:06:04] me a Christian it's not because I I I
[1:06:06] would say oh I was quiet that's what
[1:06:09] makes me a Christian so it's not the
[1:06:10] sounding of being quiet it's not the
[1:06:13] screaming it's not yes it's not because
[1:06:15] of some external emotion you are a
[1:06:18] Christian because the word says you are
[1:06:20] a Christian
[1:06:23] and we want to be anchored into that
[1:06:25] I've said this before the main thing is
[1:06:28] to keep the main thing the main thing
[1:06:29] oftentimes we get distracted in what the
[1:06:32] main thing is oh I shout it that means I
[1:06:35] got it no you didn't get it when you
[1:06:38] shouted make sure behind that shout
[1:06:40] there's a word that you are sending on
[1:06:43] and I want to say this it's also equally
[1:06:46] important that when these things are
[1:06:48] spoken we come into an understanding
[1:06:50] that God is in our midst and we are here
[1:06:54] we are born of the spirit of God we are
[1:06:57] born by the word of God and we are
[1:07:00] gathered here if God has done something
[1:07:02] for you if God has ever saved you if you
[1:07:05] know where he's gotten you from that is
[1:07:08] going to make you shout and praise him
[1:07:13] we don't want to be you know this uh of
[1:07:16] sour face Christians and the song leader
[1:07:19] comes here and there's afraid to look at
[1:07:20] your face because he doesn't want to
[1:07:22] offend you he's looking at the ceiling
[1:07:24] or you come and you feel like you don't
[1:07:26] want to worship God and your hands are
[1:07:28] like this no we want to be a people that
[1:07:30] are Gather in the presence of God we
[1:07:32] know how to praise him because let me
[1:07:34] tell you there's not a people on the
[1:07:36] face of the Earth that have been given
[1:07:38] the way to worship God like you have
[1:07:42] it's a position that nobody else has
[1:07:44] therefore when we come into the Assembly
[1:07:47] of God we have the right to worship him
[1:07:49] we have the right to praise him we have
[1:07:52] the right to show our affection for what
[1:07:54] he's done for us we don't want to hide
[1:07:56] it or come and say well if I shout don't
[1:07:58] tell me well I'm not I'm just a shark no
[1:08:01] that's not what we're saying this
[1:08:02] morning what was said is this morning
[1:08:04] was when you shout make sure you got it
[1:08:08] make sure your shout is to do that God
[1:08:10] and if you're in the midst where people
[1:08:12] are shouting if you feel it's not God
[1:08:14] don't do it
[1:08:17] do what God places in your heart to do
[1:08:19] if it's not God don't do it but if it's
[1:08:22] God who lift up your hands and worship
[1:08:24] him
[1:08:26] I'll tell you this let me say this for
[1:08:28] what is done for me I don't care where I
[1:08:31] am
[1:08:34] I don't care who's around me my heart
[1:08:37] wants to show my appreciation for him
[1:08:42] we can come and just be our formal and
[1:08:45] the songs are being sang and you're
[1:08:47] looking in the ceiling and not sure what
[1:08:50] you're thinking about perhaps your food
[1:08:52] at home when you when church is over or
[1:08:55] where you're going to go and what you're
[1:08:57] going to do right after the songs are
[1:08:59] finished and the service is over we
[1:09:01] can't be that way
[1:09:02] we have to be people that are in cage
[1:09:04] when I come I want to be a participant I
[1:09:08] don't want to be just a watcher I want
[1:09:10] to be one that comes in the middle and I
[1:09:12] want to show that this God has been good
[1:09:14] to me I want to show everybody to know
[1:09:17] this is a good god it's like testifying
[1:09:19] to somebody and you all beaten up you
[1:09:22] know God is good and
[1:09:24] I want you to believe anything I won't
[1:09:26] believe in that kind of God
[1:09:28] who's gonna be attracted to that kind of
[1:09:31] God but we are here have gathered as a
[1:09:34] living people of a living God what about
[1:09:38] them says one place he says we are the
[1:09:40] image of the Living God here
[1:09:43] representing him on Earth therefore we
[1:09:45] have the Liberty to know that I have
[1:09:47] been saved I'm not ashamed to say it
[1:09:51] but he has to be in the right
[1:09:53] identification
[1:09:55] so so we are here in the spiritual I'll
[1:09:59] say we are living in the time of
[1:10:01] identification what was in the beginning
[1:10:03] what was in God's mind at the beginning
[1:10:06] for this age is being manifested the
[1:10:10] spirit of God is here calling the elect
[1:10:12] out of the church out from the the um it
[1:10:16] says come out from among them and it's
[1:10:18] crying out it's the cry for the last
[1:10:20] hour and God is calling out his people
[1:10:22] for his namesake
[1:10:24] as the iniquity is filling up
[1:10:28] as the iniquity of the world is filling
[1:10:30] up God is here to call in elect for his
[1:10:34] name's sake
[1:10:36] now he says here in the message things
[1:10:38] that are to be oh I love this message I
[1:10:41] always feel like everything leads to
[1:10:43] things that are to be
[1:10:44] because what's it what's what's here now
[1:10:47] is what was promised was going to be and
[1:10:50] what we're going to meet in the presence
[1:10:51] is things that I promise to be there's
[1:10:54] nothing new Under The Sun It's God to
[1:10:57] begin with it's God in the middle it's
[1:10:59] God at the end the scripture says that
[1:11:01] God who was above us The God Who came
[1:11:03] and dwelled with us with Jesus that same
[1:11:06] God is manifesting himself in the end
[1:11:08] time according to his promise what was
[1:11:10] the promise of his manifestation in the
[1:11:12] end time he will manifest himself in his
[1:11:15] people
[1:11:16] Hallelujah
[1:11:19] it says this old listen to this he says
[1:11:22] this old Earth every preached in
[1:11:25] December 5th
[1:11:26] 1965 paragraph 106. it says this Earthly
[1:11:30] Tabernacle here you know what is it this
[1:11:33] body is like an old court that you wear
[1:11:36] it says a court that you once wear but
[1:11:39] now you have you have one so much better
[1:11:42] you don't use this anymore what do you
[1:11:45] do you hang it on the closet for you've
[1:11:48] got a better one you've got a better
[1:11:49] Court he says it's more it's more it
[1:11:53] says it's more up to that it's more
[1:11:55] up-to-date than the one you used to wear
[1:11:57] it says that's worn out what it says it
[1:12:01] says in this garment you are you are the
[1:12:05] inside of that there
[1:12:09] you are the inside of that dare
[1:12:12] it says that garment only done what he
[1:12:17] bore the image
[1:12:18] he bought the image it says but you
[1:12:21] don't need it anymore you are hung it up
[1:12:25] it's a rack now let me just stop here
[1:12:28] before I go because this is very
[1:12:30] important
[1:12:31] is warning as as he's identifying you is
[1:12:36] wanting you to know that you are not
[1:12:38] this court
[1:12:40] yes he's telling you you are not this
[1:12:44] court this body is not you in fact at
[1:12:47] one place he says we never met one
[1:12:49] another the real you is what's inside of
[1:12:52] you and the reason why that's important
[1:12:54] is because as I'm standing here we make
[1:12:57] a lot of mistakes
[1:12:58] and we make a lot of we do a lot of
[1:13:01] things and the the process of fixing it
[1:13:04] or understanding it is for you to
[1:13:07] understand that you have a flesh that's
[1:13:08] always going to fight you
[1:13:10] it's for you to understand that you are
[1:13:13] not the flesh you are what's inside of
[1:13:16] that flesh you know I would do something
[1:13:18] wrong and I will really go perhaps I'll
[1:13:21] sit down with myself I'll ask Billy is
[1:13:24] this really what you wanted to do is
[1:13:26] this really what you desire to have as
[1:13:28] an outcome the real me will say no I
[1:13:30] didn't mean to do that
[1:13:32] now I know I'm sounding crazy but that's
[1:13:35] the word of God the real you say that's
[1:13:38] really not the intention when I said it
[1:13:40] I didn't really mean to do that I didn't
[1:13:42] really mean to say that's important
[1:13:44] because now you understand the
[1:13:46] difference because when we want to get
[1:13:48] at the end it's for the real you to grow
[1:13:51] up and to conquer this flesh so he can
[1:13:54] bring this flesh to where it's obeying
[1:13:56] the word of God
[1:13:58] there you go
[1:14:00] but if you consider your flesh as you
[1:14:03] then you have a problem you have an
[1:14:06] endless problem that's going to fight
[1:14:08] you day in and day out but if you
[1:14:10] understand the real you is the
[1:14:12] predestinated you then you can say I
[1:14:15] have this court that's troubling me
[1:14:16] every day I'm gonna go in the spirit of
[1:14:19] God is going to anoint me so that I can
[1:14:21] overcome it
[1:14:28] when someone has an addiction
[1:14:31] at least from what I understand the
[1:14:33] first thing is he has to separate
[1:14:36] himself from his addiction
[1:14:38] he has to understand this is the
[1:14:40] addiction but this is not me this is
[1:14:43] something that's afflicting me
[1:14:46] if you just say well I'm addicted
[1:14:48] you're going to remain that for the rest
[1:14:50] of the life
[1:14:51] isn't verse says that he speaks he says
[1:14:54] when the spirit comes he will anoint
[1:14:56] your body and he says when the
[1:14:58] inspiration comes down it says the
[1:15:00] inspiration will come and it will cause
[1:15:02] your body to obey your confession but if
[1:15:05] your confession is that's what you are
[1:15:07] then it can't work what he wants us to
[1:15:09] do is to understand what the real you is
[1:15:11] and then he says here let me continue it
[1:15:14] says that's the way this body is he says
[1:15:17] you it's more the image of the Heavenly
[1:15:20] and then it says it's not you you are
[1:15:23] you are you are on the inside of that
[1:15:26] body
[1:15:27] you the spirit of God is on the inside
[1:15:32] of that body you the spirit of God is
[1:15:36] inside of that body if you were made in
[1:15:39] the image of God if you were made in the
[1:15:41] likeness of God you are the spirit of
[1:15:44] God that resides inside of that party
[1:15:46] why you need is to get a charge from
[1:15:48] Heaven what you need is to get a charge
[1:15:50] from the word for you to recognize your
[1:15:53] possession and take the flesh under the
[1:15:55] Dominion of of the spirit he says that
[1:15:58] what makes the outside comes into
[1:16:01] subject because the inside is pulling it
[1:16:05] it says see bringing it in line with the
[1:16:09] word of God your inside you yourself
[1:16:12] your being
[1:16:14] and I know our pastor has preached on
[1:16:16] this many many years ago I believe
[1:16:20] many many years ago speaking about uh
[1:16:24] understanding of the real you and I
[1:16:26] think it's something that we need to
[1:16:27] constantly be reminded of
[1:16:29] not this flesh I I'm battling this flesh
[1:16:33] every day I woke up this morning today
[1:16:36] because I came from some meaning you
[1:16:38] tell me I'm the best Christian there is
[1:16:40] the next day I walk up and he tells me
[1:16:42] I'm the worst Christian that is
[1:16:44] my latest mistake is my always my is
[1:16:47] always the thing that's going to bring
[1:16:49] me down and that's what makes happening
[1:16:51] let me say this Jesus said I came for
[1:16:54] the Lost ship of Israel
[1:16:56] in other words the Lord's sheep was your
[1:16:59] qualification to receiving the
[1:17:01] Redemption that he had to give
[1:17:04] the fact that you are a lost sheep made
[1:17:07] you a candidate for you to receive the
[1:17:09] blood the fact that you were lost made
[1:17:12] you a candidate for you to be saved so
[1:17:14] he can't turn around and say that you
[1:17:16] are not saved while at the same time
[1:17:18] calling you a sinner so the story is
[1:17:20] going to be straight in other words if
[1:17:22] you are a sinner it's God who made you
[1:17:25] perfect if there's anything good in you
[1:17:27] it's God who did it
[1:17:29] because we know
[1:17:31] within us as human there's nothing good
[1:17:35] it says this body is just an old court
[1:17:38] and someday what will you do with it he
[1:17:41] says you he says he was only in the
[1:17:44] Garment for a while
[1:17:46] this is like the Earthly garment this
[1:17:49] body your body he says your real self
[1:17:53] is on the inside
[1:17:55] of this old Court
[1:17:57] that he says that is called William
[1:17:59] Brennan
[1:18:01] or Susie Jones or whatever whatever it
[1:18:04] is
[1:18:05] see
[1:18:06] someday it will hang in the earth in a
[1:18:10] in a hole of the memory of you of memory
[1:18:13] of you you will put on it you will put
[1:18:15] it on Yonder in the grave and somebody
[1:18:17] will put it in the Tomb in the tombstone
[1:18:20] up he says here lies reference so and so
[1:18:23] and John so and so and so and so it says
[1:18:26] it lies right there as a memorial of you
[1:18:30] people just seen you in this whatever
[1:18:34] you was it says you're you're real you
[1:18:38] was on the inside of that but the court
[1:18:42] itself just bought the image of the
[1:18:46] heavenly
[1:18:48] Paul said as we bow the image of the
[1:18:51] Earthly
[1:18:52] so shall we bear the image of the
[1:18:55] heavenly
[1:18:57] and I say God is here in the mystery of
[1:19:00] the contrast it's important we
[1:19:02] understand that this flesh was given for
[1:19:04] us for us to express what God is
[1:19:08] the real you is to express itself in
[1:19:12] some ways and we know the manifestation
[1:19:15] has to come so the flesh was given for
[1:19:18] us to manifest the real you that's
[1:19:20] inside of you the flesh was given in
[1:19:23] other words you stand here you have a
[1:19:25] desire to please God you have a desire
[1:19:27] but that that manifestation has to be
[1:19:30] shown somehow
[1:19:32] and this flesh was given for that so we
[1:19:35] can manifest
[1:19:36] but does I of a true Christian
[1:19:39] is for us to come tonight
[1:19:41] is for us to kill the life that's in the
[1:19:44] flesh
[1:19:45] and have the light of the life of the
[1:19:48] spirit in US of the spirit of God come
[1:19:51] and be manifested for one of them speaks
[1:19:53] about the
[1:19:54] it speaks about the badge of skin how it
[1:19:57] would be taken and every life out of it
[1:19:59] will be beaten it says it will be beaten
[1:20:02] until there was no more life in it and
[1:20:04] then it would be taken so it can come
[1:20:06] and be covered for the holy of holies in
[1:20:09] other words what we desire is to kill
[1:20:11] this person this human this life that's
[1:20:14] in it that their own thinking their own
[1:20:16] way of doing what is what he wants to do
[1:20:18] where he wants to go to kill it so we
[1:20:21] can bring it in the image of God it says
[1:20:23] all people have you he says if you made
[1:20:27] your reservation to change quotes have
[1:20:29] you made your reservation for heaven
[1:20:31] remember you must have a reservation you
[1:20:34] can't get there without him
[1:20:37] I'm talking to you in a modern language
[1:20:39] now it says and you know if you if
[1:20:43] you've got that hotel it says and you
[1:20:45] know you know well you know what I'm
[1:20:47] saying so yeah we are and it's speaking
[1:20:50] it's important that we understand if we
[1:20:54] if this is not the real me if this is
[1:20:56] body is not the real me then I need to
[1:20:59] identify with the real me so I can bring
[1:21:02] it into manifestation and the real me is
[1:21:05] what he said a moment ago when we really
[1:21:07] said about the Chinese Laundry is what
[1:21:10] God had in his mind trying to protect it
[1:21:13] through the flesh is what God had in the
[1:21:15] beginning him trying to bring it in
[1:21:18] projection so he can come and be
[1:21:19] manifested in reality the true basis of
[1:21:22] identification is not based on what of
[1:21:25] people uh uh lying down uh rules that oh
[1:21:30] this is what you need to be if you only
[1:21:32] meet this requirement then it's you if
[1:21:35] you only do this that's you no but the
[1:21:37] real base of or desire to bring is the
[1:21:41] desire to bring an understanding of what
[1:21:43] you are or how where you come from and
[1:21:46] what you are placed here to do
[1:21:50] when we say I need I I want to be
[1:21:53] identified I want to come to their
[1:21:56] understanding of what I am is not to
[1:21:59] come into some understanding of some
[1:22:01] restriction
[1:22:02] there you go this is what you got to do
[1:22:05] if you feed this model then that's what
[1:22:07] that's what makes you what you are if
[1:22:09] you do this all then that's what makes
[1:22:11] you what you are that kind of
[1:22:13] understanding will always bring
[1:22:14] confusion because you will always need
[1:22:17] an update on what you need to do next
[1:22:20] like the Rich Young Ruler he says I've
[1:22:22] done all of this what do I need to do
[1:22:25] next
[1:22:26] I've done all of this what do I need to
[1:22:28] do next but when you come into the
[1:22:30] understanding of what God wanted to do
[1:22:33] and why he placed you here which is what
[1:22:35] we heard this morning it brings Clarity
[1:22:38] for you to know the purpose for your
[1:22:41] life for you to understand that I don't
[1:22:44] need someone to tell me or what I should
[1:22:47] or should not be doing I need to be
[1:22:49] inspired by the word of God moved by the
[1:22:52] word of God in order for me to get into
[1:22:54] action
[1:22:57] otherwise you lose it otherwise you you
[1:23:00] you you lose the understanding of what
[1:23:02] identification they want you to be the
[1:23:04] true identification is is clearly built
[1:23:08] upon the understanding that God is the
[1:23:11] one who's leading you
[1:23:13] he's the one who chose you he's the one
[1:23:16] who elected you is the one who placed
[1:23:18] you here and he's the one doing the
[1:23:20] leading
[1:23:21] the church is meant to be led by the
[1:23:24] spirit of God yes the churches the
[1:23:26] people that are inspired by the word of
[1:23:29] God that are moving and and fulfilling
[1:23:32] the word of God what has happened is
[1:23:34] many intellectuals have taken this
[1:23:37] message and they've brought forth their
[1:23:39] own understanding yeah yeah oh this is
[1:23:41] what this means and everybody follows oh
[1:23:44] this is what this means and then we have
[1:23:46] it every time we read that scripture we
[1:23:48] got to think about what that person said
[1:23:50] about the understanding that's not the
[1:23:52] way God leads his people he leads his
[1:23:54] people his children by his Spirit he
[1:23:57] reveals it to you it doesn't matter if
[1:24:00] you're the only one that sees it that
[1:24:02] way
[1:24:05] if everybody else is in a different way
[1:24:07] it doesn't matter as long as God who
[1:24:11] shows you you go forward with it and we
[1:24:14] want to build an environment where
[1:24:15] people are comfortable knowing what is
[1:24:17] it that God is showing me
[1:24:20] because often time it's the swap of
[1:24:22] intellect I take my inner life I give it
[1:24:24] to you you take yours you hand it back
[1:24:26] to me
[1:24:29] it's not what we desire we want God to
[1:24:31] move in our midst we want God to speak
[1:24:34] to us we want his word to be manifested
[1:24:37] in our midst now you know there are many
[1:24:39] that comes here that are not born again
[1:24:41] we need them to get into an atmosphere
[1:24:44] that we can create that the new birth
[1:24:46] can come upon them
[1:24:48] we don't want to take them and oh oh you
[1:24:51] are you you are you are a Believer do
[1:24:52] you believe what I just said okay that
[1:24:54] means well no that's not we want him to
[1:24:56] come in contact with God because when he
[1:24:59] meets the challenge you want him
[1:25:01] something within him not you you want
[1:25:04] him to be able to answer to the request
[1:25:11] it's important
[1:25:12] we be led by the spirit of God we come
[1:25:16] in contact with this God and say I'm
[1:25:19] here because you don't know what I have
[1:25:21] to go through you know oftentimes and I
[1:25:23] I want it down as you know people they
[1:25:26] they you have the denomination world or
[1:25:30] even you see it in the message
[1:25:34] you don't know what I had to do for this
[1:25:36] message
[1:25:37] you don't know what I had to give up
[1:25:40] you don't know hey you know this or that
[1:25:44] that's wonderful but it's for you it's
[1:25:46] not for me
[1:25:50] when the prophet himself says
[1:25:53] a Believer he says it's the Holy Spirit
[1:25:56] that's hunting for you
[1:25:59] I believe it's Easter seal or the rising
[1:26:02] of the Easter seal or uh one of those
[1:26:06] messages it says the believer it's the
[1:26:08] Holy Spirit the hunting for you
[1:26:10] making you uncomfortable
[1:26:13] looking and whatever life you were
[1:26:15] living in you were happy at it and then
[1:26:16] now you're no longer happy he's
[1:26:18] constantly he brings you right into the
[1:26:21] altar but when I'm says doesn't it fit
[1:26:25] he says now you look back everything fed
[1:26:28] you were somewhere somebody told you
[1:26:30] something that sounded strange you came
[1:26:33] into a service the preacher said
[1:26:34] something that didn't make any sense oh
[1:26:36] God is in the business of taking what
[1:26:38] doesn't make sense and make it sense to
[1:26:40] you don't be afraid of what doesn't make
[1:26:43] sense let him take that what doesn't
[1:26:46] make sense he will bring your answer to
[1:26:48] your heart
[1:26:56] it says here
[1:27:04] you well he says you sell you may have
[1:27:06] said I'm just not the right kind of
[1:27:09] Christian
[1:27:10] he says how can you come to God without
[1:27:13] God calling you
[1:27:15] first
[1:27:16] it says
[1:27:18] all that E4 news then he called is that
[1:27:23] right and all that he called he
[1:27:25] justified is that right all that he
[1:27:28] justified he had also called or already
[1:27:31] he had already past tense glorified him
[1:27:35] and he says it's a finished work from
[1:27:38] the foundation of the world
[1:27:40] we're not going to add anything to the
[1:27:43] program
[1:27:45] we're not going to add one thing to the
[1:27:47] program the program is already set is
[1:27:50] asking us to just follow it the program
[1:27:52] is already set is asking us to just
[1:27:54] glide on it the program is already said
[1:27:57] he just wants us to participate in it to
[1:27:59] know that this is the program it's not
[1:28:01] great Miracles here great Miracles here
[1:28:04] no it's the word what is the word saying
[1:28:06] oh I tell you my brother my sister he he
[1:28:09] says one place he says you you said well
[1:28:12] I shouted he says well you know
[1:28:14] everybody you can go to the ball game
[1:28:16] people are shouting
[1:28:19] you said I spoke in tongue he said well
[1:28:21] I'll tell you this I went to the
[1:28:23] muhammadan and all of them the Buddhist
[1:28:26] it says all of them they did the same
[1:28:28] thing
[1:28:30] if that's your base of measuring
[1:28:33] you obviously have done the wrong
[1:28:35] direction
[1:28:36] but if you would say well I did it
[1:28:38] because the word says it to do it if you
[1:28:41] would worship Him you say because the
[1:28:42] word says enter into his temple with
[1:28:45] Thanksgiving if you worship him because
[1:28:47] the scripture says lift up your hands
[1:28:49] and worship him if you would do it
[1:28:51] because the word says to do it then you
[1:28:53] would rip the benefit of what the word
[1:28:55] says
[1:28:57] right
[1:28:59] so he says it's all right he says God
[1:29:02] how can how can you come to God without
[1:29:04] him calling you first and already know
[1:29:07] the full call he also called is that
[1:29:09] right it says uh it's a Finnish work
[1:29:12] from the foundation of the world now he
[1:29:14] says to whom would we go it says as some
[1:29:17] kind something knocked on your heart you
[1:29:21] Rose up and you stood on your feet and
[1:29:22] you walked down the aisle and it says
[1:29:25] and something draw you and not it says
[1:29:29] now let me give you the scripture he
[1:29:31] says all that is for new then he also
[1:29:34] called he says that was God calling you
[1:29:40] now did you think that was God calling
[1:29:43] you absolutely not
[1:29:45] in fact you thought it was the strangers
[1:29:47] I remember
[1:29:49] just being a young man I went and uh the
[1:29:52] way I came into the message I was at my
[1:29:54] living with my older brother who was in
[1:29:56] the message and he took me to church and
[1:29:59] I went with him and I was there I would
[1:30:02] listen and you know people would be
[1:30:03] rejoicing and listening I would just sit
[1:30:05] there stealing everything and then after
[1:30:07] I left I went to another church
[1:30:11] um and and the the preacher will come up
[1:30:13] and preach and I'll sit there and I'm
[1:30:15] just like
[1:30:17] this sound a little bit different
[1:30:20] you know I was like you know it doesn't
[1:30:21] really sound like over there you know
[1:30:23] it's
[1:30:24] now if you gave me the Bible and said
[1:30:26] show me what you were talking about I
[1:30:27] didn't know
[1:30:28] I didn't know all I knew is something
[1:30:30] within me was not identifying with where
[1:30:32] I was
[1:30:33] in fact so much so that one day the
[1:30:36] preacher called me up he says can you
[1:30:38] remain behind after service
[1:30:40] and so he called me and he you know he's
[1:30:42] talking to me and says you know I see
[1:30:44] see your life you know it seems like
[1:30:46] something is you know special with your
[1:30:48] life and all I'm thinking is he wants me
[1:30:49] to stay here
[1:30:51] foreign
[1:30:52] all I'm thinking is he wants me to stay
[1:30:55] here and I'm going to run it right after
[1:30:57] this conversation it's the last time
[1:30:58] he's gonna see my face
[1:31:01] yes God talking to you calling you
[1:31:04] that's why the prophet said it only
[1:31:06] takes it's only after years it's only
[1:31:09] when you look back you begin to
[1:31:11] understand it's only after you look back
[1:31:13] you begin oh no wonder that person said
[1:31:15] this no wonder this happened here no
[1:31:17] wonder that person called me there's no
[1:31:19] one of this it's only after a time that
[1:31:21] all of those things begin to make sense
[1:31:23] what is it it was God calling God's
[1:31:26] calling on Supernatural God's calling
[1:31:29] and not human calling God's calling he
[1:31:32] comes and he does the calling not just
[1:31:34] the call he provides a place for you to
[1:31:36] worship him he works in both ends he
[1:31:39] plays a desire for you to be a Christian
[1:31:41] he sends a message that will hear and
[1:31:44] then within you when you hear that
[1:31:45] message you you want the message to
[1:31:48] become a part of your life what is it
[1:31:50] it's doing it on both sides he provides
[1:31:52] the calling and he answers the call
[1:32:00] and it's not change it
[1:32:02] he hasn't changed it today he's done the
[1:32:06] same thing and that's what the messenger
[1:32:07] is telling us
[1:32:18] it says
[1:32:28] let this mind be in you
[1:32:31] that was also in Christ
[1:32:36] and Prophet said
[1:32:39] he that he always believed the word I
[1:32:41] love it
[1:32:43] when he woke up in the morning
[1:32:46] he wanted to know what the word
[1:32:48] wanted him to do that day
[1:32:51] what is it that my father wants me to do
[1:32:53] in this day
[1:32:55] he wanted to know
[1:32:58] what is it that was written about him
[1:33:01] so he may walk in it
[1:33:03] and fulfill it at the age of 12 13 it
[1:33:07] was found in the temple with the with
[1:33:08] the with the high priest debating on the
[1:33:11] scripture he wasn't pointing the
[1:33:13] scripture about somebody else he was
[1:33:15] showing them exactly what the word said
[1:33:17] about him
[1:33:19] he was telling me well the scripture
[1:33:21] says he was to be born in Bethlehem look
[1:33:24] at here is that true he said yeah it
[1:33:26] says okay the scripture says a virgin
[1:33:27] shall conceive they said yes it says
[1:33:29] isn't a hint he said I'm he that's
[1:33:31] talking to you
[1:33:34] I think oftentimes we we stay in our
[1:33:37] right mind for too much I want us to get
[1:33:40] into the mind of Christ what is the mind
[1:33:43] of Christ is what the word says is what
[1:33:45] I will believe what the word says is
[1:33:48] what I want oh I love that we were
[1:33:49] listening the other day and I believe
[1:33:51] it's a perfect phrase where verbena made
[1:33:54] that statement he says a Believer it's
[1:33:56] the faith of God that moves in them that
[1:33:59] scripture that they just captivated my
[1:34:02] heart it's the faith of God that moves
[1:34:05] in them and I thought about how the
[1:34:07] prophet will say God is word when he
[1:34:10] spoke his word his word had his faith
[1:34:12] attached to it when he said let her be
[1:34:15] he said God believed his own word when
[1:34:17] he spoke it he spoke it he believed it
[1:34:20] and he came to pass you think when he
[1:34:23] spoke about you he didn't believe that
[1:34:24] he was going to come to pass you think
[1:34:26] when he spoke about you he had to come
[1:34:28] somehow and make it happen or think oh
[1:34:30] how am I going to bring this to pass the
[1:34:32] same faith that spoke the world into
[1:34:34] existence the same Faith spoke you into
[1:34:37] existence and that's not the end of it
[1:34:40] the end of it is whatever is moving
[1:34:42] within you it's his faith
[1:34:45] that's right Amen to bring his word to
[1:34:48] come to pass
[1:34:52] he did nothing except what the father
[1:34:55] showed him
[1:34:57] when he woke up in the morning
[1:35:01] he looked for the mind of God for that
[1:35:03] day
[1:35:05] what would you have me to do
[1:35:08] remember he said exactly what he did
[1:35:10] with Christ so is the bride
[1:35:15] we want this identification from the
[1:35:18] real you
[1:35:19] to come forth
[1:35:21] yeah I don't know about you but I'm
[1:35:23] tired of my own flesh
[1:35:25] I'm tired of my own thinking I'm tired
[1:35:28] of my own approach I'm tired of my own
[1:35:31] understanding of the scripture I want
[1:35:33] God to move in me and bring his word to
[1:35:36] come to pass I want when I woke up in
[1:35:38] the morning to be led by the spirit to
[1:35:40] do what I'm doing I don't want to just
[1:35:42] do it as a routine well this is what I
[1:35:44] do every day and everything I'll do that
[1:35:46] but until he moves in me I will take his
[1:35:49] word until he moves in me and causes me
[1:35:52] to do what he wants me to do
[1:35:57] the prophet says in the message
[1:35:59] identified with Christ it says how do
[1:36:02] you become identified with him
[1:36:06] say he said I'll say brother Branham now
[1:36:09] get to get he says you have to dress up
[1:36:13] like a Hollywood star or do some other
[1:36:15] things he says but how do you identify
[1:36:18] with Jesus Christ
[1:36:20] he says first you'll repent
[1:36:22] of what you already have done
[1:36:25] and then you identify yourself here in
[1:36:28] the pool it says no doubt but many but
[1:36:32] what many will be identified with him in
[1:36:34] a few minutes in the pool and identify
[1:36:37] with him in the baptism for for if we
[1:36:40] are buried in Christ
[1:36:42] we are identify in his death burial and
[1:36:45] Resurrection
[1:36:46] let me say this that formula has never
[1:36:49] changed
[1:36:51] you can't say I believe the message
[1:36:53] therefore I don't have to repent
[1:36:56] I believe the message therefore I don't
[1:36:58] have to be baptized I believe the
[1:37:01] message therefore I don't have to go
[1:37:03] through the stages I don't have to no
[1:37:06] you still have to be born again
[1:37:09] and that's the main problem we run into
[1:37:11] is we have had this word and many have
[1:37:14] taken it intellectually we speak about
[1:37:16] it we talk about it but yet we have
[1:37:18] never met a living God I'll tell you
[1:37:21] this I would rather meet the Living God
[1:37:23] and stand here and speak I know I want
[1:37:25] to meet the Living God who wrote the
[1:37:27] word and have his word become a reality
[1:37:30] to me more than anything men can offer
[1:37:34] because meeting the Living God will give
[1:37:37] you the revelation of what he said but
[1:37:40] if you take the word by yourself you're
[1:37:42] going to try to figure out this and
[1:37:43] figure out that and this doesn't match
[1:37:45] and and this all of that but when you
[1:37:47] meet him he's the author of The Bible if
[1:37:50] you don't understand it you lay it aside
[1:37:52] he will come and give you the revelation
[1:37:53] of it and that's what we desire we want
[1:37:56] him to give us the revelation of what he
[1:37:59] has spoken
[1:38:02] he said you identify in the poll and his
[1:38:04] resurrection it says that's the way you
[1:38:06] are baptized you go down into the water
[1:38:08] come back come back up to witness what
[1:38:12] we believe in death burial and
[1:38:14] resurrection of Jesus Christ and if we
[1:38:17] if we be planted in his likeness in the
[1:38:20] in his death God
[1:38:22] gave us a promise that will be like him
[1:38:25] in the resurrection
[1:38:30] let me say this in all sincerity
[1:38:33] there's nothing that means more to us
[1:38:35] than the resurrection
[1:38:37] and that is his life living in us take
[1:38:40] everything
[1:38:41] take the seals take all of that give me
[1:38:43] Christ let me take the resurrection
[1:38:46] because the resurrection is a promise
[1:38:49] that when I go down I'll come back up
[1:38:52] let's not just become intellectual let's
[1:38:55] become Living Word of Christ walking on
[1:38:58] this Earth you become the gospel that's
[1:39:00] walking someone can look at you and say
[1:39:02] this is God I have seen God people
[1:39:05] looked at Birth and says we have seen
[1:39:07] God Walk In Our Generation oh I tell you
[1:39:10] if just a little bit that we know of
[1:39:13] this message if we can really take it
[1:39:15] with the hopeful revelation of what we
[1:39:17] know it's got to make us different
[1:39:19] people
[1:39:20] we don't need oh I need more and more
[1:39:22] just what we have just what we have
[1:39:25] received what we know what he has spoken
[1:39:27] is enough to change us
[1:39:36] I said and if the Life of Christ lives
[1:39:39] in the person
[1:39:40] they become identified with him this
[1:39:43] isn't a message of token it's Christ in
[1:39:46] you not the church member not a system
[1:39:48] but a resurrected power it's the Holy
[1:39:51] Ghost it's the token in you that your
[1:39:53] life says Amen to every scripture to the
[1:39:57] promise as is written in there
[1:40:00] it says and you are not of yourself no
[1:40:02] more you are Christ
[1:40:05] he says you don't think your own thought
[1:40:07] you don't think your own thoughts you
[1:40:09] say I think no more thoughts coming
[1:40:13] the life that was in Christ is in you
[1:40:17] the mind that was in Christ is in you
[1:40:19] the works that was that was in Christ is
[1:40:22] in you and Christ himself is in you you
[1:40:26] are already you are dead your life is
[1:40:29] hid in God through Christ sealed in
[1:40:33] there by the Holy Ghost
[1:40:35] you are not your own
[1:40:38] that's what a Christian is that's what
[1:40:41] we are called to be that's what we are
[1:40:44] we are dead to ourselves through our own
[1:40:47] thinking our own thoughts all we live is
[1:40:50] whatever pleases
[1:40:52] the Lord is what I will do like David
[1:40:55] and his servants he stood there and one
[1:40:58] day he said they and he felt like
[1:41:00] drinking the wall from Jacob's Well just
[1:41:02] that's all he had drink all the others
[1:41:05] everything was dirty one day he just
[1:41:07] felt within himself he said oh if I can
[1:41:10] just get a cup of that water again
[1:41:13] he didn't give a command he just said
[1:41:16] his wish
[1:41:17] and his servant took sword and drove two
[1:41:21] miles a couple of miles of Philistines
[1:41:25] of so they can get him that water for
[1:41:27] him to drink yeah
[1:41:29] yeah isn't that our desire tonight
[1:41:32] you know the scripture says a word that
[1:41:34] should be
[1:41:36] you know I I was going to entitle this
[1:41:38] the desire or the the the the God's
[1:41:41] desire for you I want that to be
[1:41:45] oh if we can only look at that and said
[1:41:47] that's what God desired me to be that
[1:41:50] only could be enough to drive to be your
[1:41:52] motivation
[1:41:54] no but we sparked through the scriptures
[1:41:56] we go through the crowds well is this
[1:41:59] God speaking or was this the prophet
[1:42:01] just speaking you know it was this his
[1:42:03] mind or was this God speaking to him
[1:42:05] when was God speaking with him when was
[1:42:07] he speaking by himself
[1:42:08] you will never get anywhere
[1:42:11] with that kind of thinking
[1:42:17] where have we got them to
[1:42:20] is that how we came in because we
[1:42:22] examine every word we examine everything
[1:42:25] and we knew this match and that match
[1:42:27] and that's how we came in no we came in
[1:42:30] because God moved upon us he drew us
[1:42:33] into him he saw he opened the message oh
[1:42:36] what a privilege so we can see him for
[1:42:38] he is and if that's the way we got in
[1:42:41] that's the way he's going to take us
[1:42:42] home it's gonna be him moving on this
[1:42:45] scripture moving on that scripture
[1:42:46] moving on this one until it fulfills the
[1:42:49] rapture
[1:42:50] right Amen in fact it says when you
[1:42:53] receive the new birth is the beginning
[1:42:55] of your rapture
[1:42:58] he says the element will build around
[1:43:01] that body that it believed the word you
[1:43:04] will believe you will build the the body
[1:43:06] around the element of that person that
[1:43:08] believes the word
[1:43:10] if we can only see that let's all stand
[1:43:19] perfect
[1:43:20] he says in marriage and the force he
[1:43:22] says
[1:43:23] and then the ceremony and that's when
[1:43:25] the bride
[1:43:27] or the bride takes the bridegroom's name
[1:43:29] she's no longer she's no longer she's no
[1:43:32] more than her own she takes the
[1:43:34] bridegroom's name it says and then after
[1:43:37] the church has a ceremony makes their
[1:43:40] promises then she texts the bridegroom's
[1:43:43] name she's no longer a church
[1:43:46] of the world she's the Church of the
[1:43:50] Lord Jesus Christ amen it says I don't
[1:43:52] mean by name I mean by birth by Nature
[1:43:56] the power of God by the revelation of
[1:43:59] the truth of the of of the the truth of
[1:44:02] God in in her heart it says she becomes
[1:44:05] a Christian Church the great Universal
[1:44:07] Apostolic Church uh Church of God she
[1:44:10] becomes a part of Christ when she does
[1:44:14] that it says listen to this Christ
[1:44:17] inject into her
[1:44:20] his own Spirit yes sir
[1:44:25] his own life and the Bible says to Adam
[1:44:29] and Eve you are no longer Twain but one
[1:44:34] and when a woman the church is married
[1:44:36] to Christ they are no they are no longer
[1:44:39] two they are one in Christ cry they are
[1:44:43] one in Christ it says Christ in you amen
[1:44:46] that's it it says his life
[1:44:49] has been brought into you then you
[1:44:51] become the bride
[1:44:54] the right is not by some Proclamation
[1:44:57] the right is by the life of the
[1:45:00] bridegroom coming into the bride the
[1:45:03] bride is not what we say we are is what
[1:45:05] the word says and the life of the word
[1:45:08] comes upon us and makes us walk the life
[1:45:11] of the Bride
[1:45:13] the life is what we are looking for yeah
[1:45:16] yeah the life is what we are planning
[1:45:18] for that's why he says I don't want to
[1:45:19] call our church I called you God why
[1:45:21] because he's bringing you into a
[1:45:23] different identification so now he could
[1:45:25] take his life and make it your life and
[1:45:29] your life becomes his life amen let's
[1:45:31] just bow he's our gracious father
[1:45:34] where could we go Lord
[1:45:38] it's you that has the words of Life
[1:45:40] father
[1:45:43] father When We Gather every day We
[1:45:45] Gather here
[1:45:47] Lord we know you have sent your
[1:45:49] messenger your messenger and you've sent
[1:45:51] us your word
[1:45:54] and it's to bring us into a certain
[1:45:56] manifestation
[1:45:59] and father that's what we desire more
[1:46:01] than anything
[1:46:04] we ask the night father that you may
[1:46:06] just once again Lord
[1:46:08] move Upon Us o God and make yourself a
[1:46:11] reality
[1:46:13] let your word
[1:46:15] we become so much word Lord that we are
[1:46:18] no longer as it's just you
[1:46:21] and you've made a way for us to go that
[1:46:24] way
[1:46:25] your Prophet says that
[1:46:28] you your word when you give us your word
[1:46:31] and I'm paraphrasing
[1:46:33] Lord is an invitation for us to receive
[1:46:36] your character
[1:46:38] and we want to receive the character
[1:46:40] tonight and say father give me that
[1:46:42] character because your Prophet told us
[1:46:44] we won't take anything out of this world
[1:46:46] except our character
[1:46:48] and we want to have a character that fit
[1:46:51] for that other place
[1:46:53] and therefore we ask father just move
[1:46:55] upon us let the word just shape us and
[1:46:58] mold us and bring us into the image
[1:47:01] Lord we are so privileged
[1:47:04] so thankful beyond measure
[1:47:09] but father tonight we want to see the
[1:47:11] fruits and the product
[1:47:13] of what you are doing walking with us
[1:47:17] leading us father taking away the things
[1:47:19] that desires of the world making
[1:47:21] yourself a real living God in our midst
[1:47:24] being lifted up out of history and
[1:47:27] making yourself a reality in your people
[1:47:29] the people of God is where the power of
[1:47:32] God is
[1:47:33] lead us or guide us Lord
[1:47:36] father that we may go out into the world
[1:47:39] and manifest you at the best way that
[1:47:41] you want us to
[1:47:43] we want to be real ambassadors and true
[1:47:46] ambassadors to you and we can only do it
[1:47:49] if you walk with us
[1:47:51] and your Prophet told us he said the way
[1:47:53] that you send Christ the god the way the
[1:47:56] same way that God sent Christ is the
[1:47:58] word that you're sending us the father
[1:48:00] that send him went in him
[1:48:03] and he said the father or Christ who's
[1:48:05] sending you he goes in you
[1:48:09] that's what we desire Lord go with us
[1:48:11] abide with us every day
[1:48:13] we commit ourselves to you and ask us
[1:48:15] things in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:17] Christ amen
[1:48:19] amen
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:28] I hope we all
[1:48:30] understand we're never going to be able
[1:48:32] to do that without making contact
[1:48:37] and that's the question we all have to
[1:48:39] ask ourselves
[1:48:41] in our heart
[1:48:42] have I made contact
[1:48:45] with The Giver of the word
[1:48:48] not did I understand it
[1:48:52] but I didn't make contact with the life
[1:48:56] that's spoken
[1:48:58] and that's an everyday Journey
[1:49:01] there's not a one-time experience
[1:49:03] everyday life
[1:49:05] of making that contact
[1:49:15] foreign
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:28] just shut everything out around you
[1:49:31] [Music]
[1:49:35] can you feel the spirit yes you can feel
[1:49:38] the spirit
[1:49:40] you can feel it moving you
[1:49:43] [Music]
[1:49:55] I want the spirit then spoken
[1:49:59] proud to touch me
[1:50:07] [Music]
[1:50:10] your place
[1:50:13] [Music]
[1:50:19] choose something special
[1:50:22] to reveal is
[1:50:25] [Music]
[1:50:40] [Applause]
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:59] inside this house
[1:51:02] [Music]
[1:51:18] [Music]
[1:51:25] went out with that work
[1:51:28] God had faith in what he spoke do you
[1:51:32] said when he said let there be light
[1:51:35] he was wondering
[1:51:37] [Music]
[1:51:38] what light would be
[1:51:41] do you think when he saw your name on
[1:51:43] the Lamb's Book of Life and he saw you
[1:51:45] and he saw a perfect blood butt
[1:51:48] Christian
[1:51:49] you think he doubted what you would be
[1:51:52] he sent Faith with it
[1:51:57] knows he sent his word he sent his
[1:52:00] spirit
[1:52:01] foreign
[1:52:02] the word doesn't Quicken
[1:52:07] do you know that
[1:52:08] the word don't Quicken it's the spirit
[1:52:11] that quickens
[1:52:13] is the intention of what that word that
[1:52:16] was spoken as our brother just preached
[1:52:19] us that's what quickens you've got to
[1:52:22] make contact with that spirit
[1:52:24] the letter killeth
[1:52:26] but the spirit gives life and I think
[1:52:30] that's what our brother plea is we we
[1:52:32] want that Spirit to make contact with us
[1:52:36] foreign
[1:52:38] bogus doesn't take away from the real
[1:52:46] it's a matter of there's bogus
[1:52:50] doesn't matter if there's if there's
[1:52:54] false prophecy there's still true
[1:52:57] prophecy
[1:52:59] does it matter if there's emotions
[1:53:01] there's still true blessing
[1:53:04] so none of that that doesn't that that's
[1:53:07] not what we're talking about we're
[1:53:09] talking about a real genuine contact
[1:53:12] that was predestinated for you
[1:53:17] oh just think of it
[1:53:20] he had a relationship predestinated for
[1:53:23] me
[1:53:23] I want to grow in that don't you
[1:53:27] I want to look for the spirit
[1:53:31] behind the word
[1:53:33] I want to look for the life my brother
[1:53:35] so beautifully brought behind the word
[1:53:39] whatever this word is spoken
[1:53:42] I know there's a real living being
[1:53:46] a real
[1:53:47] life that you can make contact with even
[1:53:51] more than you could hug me
[1:53:54] the spirit's more real
[1:53:56] than this is
[1:53:58] because this changes those who have
[1:54:01] known me for a long time has known the
[1:54:03] changes
[1:54:04] but he's never changed
[1:54:08] to do all that you can this week
[1:54:12] to set aside some time
[1:54:15] just to make contact with him
[1:54:18] to let all the thoughts of the day go
[1:54:20] away
[1:54:22] just to be shut in with God
[1:54:25] go in that secret place
[1:54:28] and let the spirit of God move through
[1:54:30] you
[1:54:31] let it cleanse you
[1:54:33] think on all the good things he said it
[1:54:35] might make you shout
[1:54:37] Hallelujah
[1:54:39] might make You Weep
[1:54:44] sat in my living room the other day and
[1:54:46] I just sat there and I just thought of
[1:54:47] how good God was to me
[1:54:49] where I come from and just how good he
[1:54:52] was to me and just how good and
[1:54:54] everything I've got and okay and I know
[1:54:57] it was all from him I'm not educated I
[1:55:00] know all those things
[1:55:01] and I went over and I sat down with
[1:55:04] breakfast with brother Tommy as you know
[1:55:06] I just sat in my room
[1:55:07] at my corner of my house today and just
[1:55:10] thought how good he is he said you know
[1:55:12] Brother David
[1:55:15] I did the very same thing this morning
[1:55:18] at the same time I just thought of how
[1:55:21] good he is
[1:55:24] and if
[1:55:25] we would just do that
[1:55:29] well I'm not afraid of the spirit to
[1:55:31] move
[1:55:33] I want it to be the spirit amen
[1:55:38] and when the spirit moves I thought
[1:55:41] Billy put it so beautiful I want to walk
[1:55:43] out with a word attached to it
[1:55:46] because the anointing may go the feeling
[1:55:49] may go the blessing may go but he puts
[1:55:53] that word as an eternal sword
[1:55:56] for it I I just I got a song in my heart
[1:56:00] it's kind of like Beulah Land
[1:56:03] you know that song
[1:56:06] I'm kind of homesick
[1:56:09] [Music]
[1:56:10] aren't you
[1:56:12] and I I wanted I want to touch the I
[1:56:16] want to touch that life River
[1:56:19] I want to renewed in me that I know that
[1:56:22] it doesn't matter
[1:56:23] [Music]
[1:56:25] you remember how tough that was in the
[1:56:28] hospital
[1:56:30] I remember coming over and seeing you
[1:56:33] yes something inside you
[1:56:37] I knew that life
[1:56:39] was there
[1:56:44] God
[1:56:45] gave us I don't know how many more years
[1:56:49] but if I'd come to that River
[1:56:52] before the rapture
[1:56:55] life that causes the Raptors the same
[1:56:58] life that's going to take me over the
[1:57:00] river
[1:57:00] and we're going to have it now
[1:57:05] I like what our brother said he said
[1:57:08] well I want to be able to create the
[1:57:10] atmosphere
[1:57:12] of our expectation and our contact with
[1:57:15] the Lord that if somebody comes in our
[1:57:17] midst that God will be there to contact
[1:57:21] them
[1:57:24] it's going to take a lot of applying the
[1:57:26] token at home
[1:57:29] it's gonna take a lot of cleansing of
[1:57:32] our thoughts it's going to take
[1:57:34] sacrifice
[1:57:37] for one drink of that water
[1:57:42] or let me do whatever it takes
[1:57:45] because it's life
[1:57:47] is anybody else here home said I think
[1:57:50] he's trying to get us in Rapture and
[1:57:52] condition amen
