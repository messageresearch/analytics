[34:59] that are still with us
[35:03] and and uh holding strong to us
[35:07] let's read these first few verses um
[35:11] uh of the book of galatians
[35:14] paul an apostle not of men
[35:17] neither by man but by
[35:21] the lord jesus christ and god the father
[35:25] who raised him from the dead and all the
[35:29] brethren which are in are with me
[35:34] into the churches of galatia
[35:37] grace be to you in peace from god
[35:40] our father and from our lord jesus
[35:43] christ
[35:44] who gave himself for our sins that he
[35:48] might
[35:48] deliver us from this present
[35:51] evil world according to the will
[35:55] of god our father to whom
[35:58] be glory forever and ever
[36:02] amen god bless you you may be seated
[36:08] we just want to talk just a little bit
[36:12] this evening and and
[36:15] take a look just at a moment and
[36:19] as we we see here that in the fourth
[36:23] verse
[36:24] who gave himself for our sins that he
[36:28] might
[36:28] deliver us from this
[36:32] present evil world according to the will
[36:38] of god and of our father
[36:41] and so we just want to uh
[36:45] take a moment to kind of remind us
[36:48] as we talked this morning
[36:51] that we are living in a present
[36:55] evil world and
[36:58] the the amazing thing
[37:01] about uh when somebody has
[37:05] uh something that's evil
[37:09] uh you you know it's always
[37:12] uh disguised you know what i mean like
[37:15] there there's so much uh
[37:18] warnings today and uh uh
[37:21] you know i'm a a member of arp
[37:25] that stands for apparently
[37:29] precious people or something you know
[37:32] but anyway i think it's an organization
[37:34] for old people
[37:36] and uh and they're always warning you
[37:39] of scams you know and uh
[37:43] and all the scams are always disguised
[37:47] you know they will call you up and say
[37:50] uh this is the government this is the
[37:53] and we're going to arrest you this is
[37:55] the fbi and
[37:57] uh you know and we found out that you've
[37:59] got
[38:00] this money you owe and if you and if
[38:03] you'll send it to us we'll take this off
[38:05] your record or
[38:07] or something like that you know and
[38:08] people panic
[38:10] uh always thought maybe their conscience
[38:13] wasn't right or something i don't know
[38:15] but what i'm trying to say is that evil
[38:17] is always disguised
[38:20] in fact the bible tells us that satan
[38:23] appears
[38:24] as an angel of light
[38:27] and we just want to talk about that just
[38:30] for a little bit this evening as we
[38:34] as we realize what we were talking about
[38:37] this morning is that we're in a
[38:39] countdown
[38:40] that that the world's counting down
[38:45] and the the things that are on their
[38:48] list
[38:49] of that the evils satan wants to
[38:53] accomplish
[38:54] before his destruction how many knows
[38:56] this world has got to get to a certain
[38:58] place
[38:59] where they cross the line that they've
[39:02] they've
[39:03] they've spurned the mercy of god they've
[39:06] rejected the word of god
[39:07] and there's nothing left for them but
[39:10] judgment
[39:11] we know that's the word of god and so
[39:14] what that we see and what that we're
[39:17] watching is we're watching the world
[39:21] slowly turn away from god
[39:24] and march down that path towards
[39:28] that line of destruction and
[39:31] and so and and remember that god
[39:34] destroyed this world
[39:36] once before because they became so evil
[39:40] and that they they wish to no longer
[39:42] retain god
[39:43] in their thinking and and so if god
[39:46] was just in in
[39:50] performing that judgment upon them then
[39:53] this world in this age can't get away
[39:56] with it
[39:56] so he says as it was in the days of noah
[40:00] in other words that was the time that
[40:02] man reached the final line
[40:04] they counted down they spurned the mercy
[40:08] they spurned the warnings they rejected
[40:11] everything that god was trying to tell
[40:13] them
[40:13] until they got to the place that they
[40:16] didn't even want to retain
[40:18] god in their knowledge and god gives
[40:21] them
[40:21] over to a reprobate mind
[40:24] so just think pretty soon this world is
[40:27] going to be
[40:28] run by people that have a reprobate mind
[40:32] they have no more common decency they
[40:35] have
[40:36] no more real care for for people
[40:40] that that that their their there's
[40:43] continually
[40:44] evil on their heart and that's what god
[40:47] said he said
[40:48] i've looked at man and their their
[40:50] thoughts are continually evil
[40:53] and he says i i i repent
[40:56] that i made man i i repent that i
[41:00] made man and and and so he he destroyed
[41:04] the earth
[41:05] the the only reason god didn't wipe it
[41:07] off totally
[41:08] is because he had an elect people
[41:12] he there was another heritage that was
[41:15] with him in the beginning
[41:17] and that was his eve that was his pride
[41:20] and he had to redeem her
[41:23] out of this earth and so he let that
[41:25] seed
[41:26] come over on that ark and both seeds
[41:29] came over on that ark
[41:30] and so that god could finish the plan of
[41:33] redemption
[41:34] and and it predestinate that seed and
[41:37] elect that seed
[41:39] and and redeem her and bring her
[41:42] into existence and when he's
[41:44] accomplished that
[41:46] there's no more need for the rest of it
[41:49] because they don't want anything to do
[41:51] with them they don't want to think about
[41:53] them they don't want to have them they
[41:54] don't want to live by
[41:55] anything that he offers in fact they
[41:58] found themselves
[42:00] something else to worship and we just
[42:04] want to
[42:04] uh just talk about that just for a few
[42:09] uh moments he's uh
[42:13] and as we talk and i really think if
[42:17] you're at home
[42:18] and this week uh if you have an
[42:21] opportunity
[42:22] i i hope that you're not too busy that
[42:24] you can't read your bible
[42:26] but i think it was a very good time
[42:30] for us as a body of believers in our
[42:33] individual study if you could work in
[42:37] uh reading and listening to
[42:40] the message the god of this evil age
[42:44] because when brother branham preached
[42:48] these things
[42:50] they they weren't as self-evident
[42:53] as they are now they seem to they
[42:58] they seem to be uh
[43:02] covered with uh with the religions
[43:06] of man the the covering of christianity
[43:10] was over america and all these spirits
[43:14] were still
[43:14] working but they were covered with
[43:18] christianity we were a christian nation
[43:21] we uh we said the pledge of allegiance
[43:24] and had god we trust on our money
[43:27] and we prayed
[43:31] and it was uh we were considered quote
[43:35] unquote
[43:36] a christian nation and we were
[43:39] we were proud to say in god we trust and
[43:42] act and we're a christian nation act and
[43:46] uh we believe it you know
[43:49] uh uh we believe in prayer you know we
[43:52] believe in the bible on the table
[43:54] and the flag upon the wall you know
[43:58] neighbors that's the answer to it all
[44:01] it's the backbone of our nation and
[44:03] you'll always find salvation
[44:06] with the bible on the table and the flag
[44:08] upon the wall
[44:09] that used to be america
[44:13] they don't want the bible you know the
[44:17] gideons which uh
[44:18] you know i helped support the gideon
[44:20] some and
[44:22] and and their effort but they used to
[44:24] put a bible in
[44:26] every motel now you know that they can't
[44:29] do it because
[44:30] it's offensive it's offensive
[44:34] you know they want to take down the
[44:35] cross
[44:38] because it's offensive there's people
[44:40] that out right
[44:41] out there today want to remove the cross
[44:44] because the cross is offensive they want
[44:47] to do away with
[44:48] uh in public places there was a certain
[44:51] city in
[44:52] in our country that they had the ten
[44:55] commandments posted
[44:57] and they they sued them to remove
[45:00] the ten commandments from the courthouse
[45:03] because it
[45:04] offended somebody
[45:07] and so it tells you that man is
[45:11] offended by god
[45:15] god is offensive to man
[45:19] amen and and that's because
[45:22] man doesn't want to follow and be what
[45:24] god created them to be
[45:26] okay and so we find that the the these
[45:30] spirits
[45:31] are working and i think this is
[45:33] important to us based on what we were
[45:36] sharing this morning that as we see this
[45:38] evil world
[45:40] getting more evil we must also
[45:43] understand
[45:44] that god has a counter to that and
[45:47] that's making an
[45:48] elect lady more christ-like
[45:51] and so as we read a few of these
[45:54] statements and just
[45:55] fellowship with you this evening those
[45:57] that are here and those that are
[46:00] listening i appreciate those of you that
[46:03] have came out because it's a lot easier
[46:05] to talk to somebody
[46:07] and then nobody
[46:11] you know i i trust that somebody listens
[46:14] better than nobody
[46:16] and and so that we rejoice around these
[46:20] things
[46:20] now these things are precious to me
[46:23] because
[46:24] they came to us
[46:28] from a messenger from god
[46:34] god sent a voice
[46:37] to tell us these things it's just not a
[46:42] great ministry that was here
[46:44] and if if you go out and you listen and
[46:47] you
[46:47] you understand what's going on on the
[46:50] church world
[46:51] many teachers today out in the nominal
[46:54] church world are quoting brother branham
[46:58] they're referring to his visions they're
[47:00] referring to his prophecy
[47:02] and all that they're doing is making him
[47:05] to be
[47:06] a great man that once came upon
[47:09] the earth and had a great
[47:12] ministry so they're taking the prophet
[47:15] of god
[47:16] and they're placing him in history
[47:21] and they're saying this was a great move
[47:23] of god and
[47:24] then they make reference to their
[47:27] ministries
[47:28] and what god's doing in them he was
[47:31] great
[47:32] he was a great messenger now i'm a
[47:34] messenger
[47:36] you know he he had great signs and
[47:38] wonders for his day and
[47:40] and and and we've moved from that and
[47:42] now here we are today
[47:44] but that was not that was just the
[47:47] vindication
[47:50] so that's what man was blessed with is
[47:53] that
[47:54] the vindication the reason the ministry
[47:57] was there and the son of man and the
[47:59] turning of the back
[48:00] to the audience and the discerning of
[48:02] the thoughts and the tense and the
[48:04] raising the dead and the blind
[48:06] eyes coming open and all the signs and
[48:08] wonders which we have never
[48:10] seen since the day of the lord jesus
[48:12] christ and we will never see again
[48:17] the manifestation that was manifested
[48:20] in the flesh of none other than jesus
[48:23] christ his
[48:24] person coming down and taking over a
[48:28] man's flesh
[48:30] and standing there in the veil
[48:33] of human flesh speaking and doing
[48:37] signs and wonders that ministry was
[48:40] prophesied for a certain time
[48:42] it was prophesied for a certain hour and
[48:45] it was carried out in a certain man
[48:49] there there's not it cannot be
[48:51] duplicated
[48:53] it cannot be duplicated but what came
[48:56] from that man
[48:58] was the message from the lord jesus
[49:01] christ himself
[49:03] through that man through that man's lips
[49:07] through that vessel in other words
[49:09] manifesting himself
[49:11] in flesh just like he managed himself
[49:14] in flesh to the uh israel
[49:18] and to the children of of god and the
[49:21] hebrew children and the 12 tribes of
[49:23] israel
[49:24] which was promised that that was
[49:26] promised to the gentiles
[49:28] that god would veil himself in flesh
[49:30] again
[49:31] that he would come and do the same signs
[49:34] and wonders
[49:35] to the gentiles that he did to the jews
[49:38] and they rejected him because there was
[49:41] an exodus
[49:42] out of the law into
[49:45] into the grace just like the prophet of
[49:49] god said if you go back and read the
[49:51] countdown
[49:52] he says man always counts backwards he
[49:54] says because there was 10
[49:56] tribes of israel
[49:59] but there was two others that were the
[50:01] sons of joseph
[50:04] was what ephraim and manassas is that
[50:07] who it was
[50:08] now when one was older and one was
[50:11] younger
[50:13] and when he went to pray for his
[50:15] children
[50:16] to give the blessing and you you know
[50:19] the law
[50:19] that the elder son got double
[50:24] the portion so he got double
[50:28] and the next son got what was
[50:31] left that was kind of how it was that
[50:34] was called the inheritance
[50:36] was passed down to the first son to keep
[50:38] everything going and to keep everything
[50:41] uh the family business going and the
[50:44] inheritance going and
[50:45] and that was their custom but when he
[50:47] went to pray for the children
[50:50] his hands crossed and he gave
[50:54] the portion to the younger showing
[50:57] that the law which was older
[51:01] the blessing was now passed from the law
[51:04] the older son to the younger son which
[51:07] was the
[51:08] the new church and that they came in an
[51:11] exodus
[51:12] from the law to grace and the
[51:15] inheritance
[51:16] now was passed over to those that
[51:19] believed in the lord jesus christ and
[51:21] received the remission of their sins
[51:23] and took the one sacrifice for sin over
[51:26] the continual
[51:28] offering for sin and it showed that that
[51:31] that passing and and so now that we're
[51:35] we're uh sitting in in
[51:38] this hour that we're sitting in
[51:41] we we are realizing that
[51:45] there's something that's passed on so
[51:48] the messenger came and delivered
[51:51] a message to an elected
[51:55] people who were going to receive an
[51:58] inheritance
[52:01] and what did esau do he didn't
[52:04] deem that inheritance in fact
[52:08] it meant nothing to him because
[52:11] he felt he could do it on his
[52:14] own he was gruff he was a hunter
[52:17] he didn't need that you know and
[52:21] he he just got so desirable
[52:24] in the flesh that he didn't the
[52:27] birthright
[52:28] and he sold it for a a bowl of soup i
[52:33] guess or
[52:33] porridge or whatever it was
[52:38] but but but to jacob that meant
[52:42] everything to him
[52:45] and and i wonder if that's if it means
[52:48] everything to us this message is our
[52:51] birthright
[52:53] you understand it's the thing that
[52:56] produces
[52:57] us and keeps us from this
[53:00] present evil world the deception
[53:05] was going to be so great that satan was
[53:08] going to appear
[53:09] as an angel of light and his deception
[53:12] was going to be so great
[53:14] so deceptive it was going to come like
[53:17] such a beautiful
[53:18] light like such a wonderful thing that
[53:22] if that the very elected
[53:26] would be deceived if possible
[53:30] now so what did god do
[53:33] to for the elected he gave them a
[53:37] message that would keep them
[53:40] from the deception of the world
[53:44] of this present evil world that was
[53:47] the purpose of the message was to come
[53:51] and keep us from the deception of this
[53:55] present evil world if you don't regard
[53:57] the message
[53:58] then how are you going to regard
[54:02] that which keeps you from being deceived
[54:05] you'll be deceived and so
[54:09] we ask ourselves and i like how this
[54:11] starts and i i really am encouraging you
[54:13] to
[54:14] sit down and listen to this it's a very
[54:16] long message
[54:17] two hours and 45 minutes you can just
[54:19] study it and go through it and skip a
[54:22] picture
[54:23] of what he's saying has god lost control
[54:28] or is he just permitting
[54:31] another agency to control
[54:35] i wonder the true answer to this
[54:38] question
[54:39] is to my opinion
[54:42] there is two opposing spirits
[54:45] in the world today at work
[54:50] two spirits how does the church be
[54:54] gain its power when it recognizes
[54:58] the two spirits okay
[55:01] and withstands
[55:04] the evil spirit and takes
[55:07] the full armor of god the word of god
[55:11] to defend itself and to defeat
[55:15] the enemy remember this message
[55:19] is your defense it's what you put
[55:22] up if not he will possess your gate
[55:26] instead of you possessing his gate so he
[55:30] said
[55:30] there's two spirits working at work
[55:33] now there can't be no more than two
[55:35] heads
[55:36] one of them is the holy spirit at work
[55:40] and the other one is the spirit of the
[55:43] devil
[55:44] and in the last days in
[55:47] deception so there's two spirits
[55:50] one is the holy spirit at work and the
[55:53] other one's the spirit of the devil in
[55:55] the last days
[55:56] in deception
[56:02] the two spirits one of them
[56:06] god's holy spirit the other one
[56:09] the devil spirit working into step
[56:12] deception and the people of the earth
[56:16] are now making their choice
[56:20] so that that's what them there's two
[56:22] spirits at work
[56:24] and these one of them is deceiving the
[56:26] people
[56:27] and the other one is telling them the
[56:29] truth
[56:30] one of them's the pure word of god that
[56:33] was promised in this days
[56:35] sent to us by the fulfillment of malachi
[56:38] 4 5
[56:38] luke 17 30 revelations 10 7
[56:42] a divine messenger that would come at a
[56:45] certain time
[56:46] you ever wonder why brother branham came
[56:48] when he did
[56:50] if he would have come in this day they
[56:52] would have shut him down
[56:58] they wouldn't allow any meetings
[57:03] you know even if 10 000 people could
[57:06] show up
[57:06] and instantly every single one of them
[57:09] test negative
[57:11] they wouldn't allow it
[57:15] someone said to me brother mcgeary this
[57:17] morning you said that the
[57:19] the pope was the devil did you know that
[57:23] got out on
[57:24] the internet praise god the world needs
[57:27] to know the pope's the devil
[57:32] it's the mark of the beast
[57:36] but you understand so satan's spirit is
[57:38] working through what
[57:39] deception you know where the mark of the
[57:42] beast
[57:43] mark of the beast is one's on your hand
[57:45] right
[57:46] and that that represents you carrying
[57:50] out his works
[57:54] his righteousness satan's righteousness
[57:57] the other is on your
[57:58] forehead which means your mind and your
[58:02] thinking
[58:03] that you think the way he thinks
[58:06] the only one place what is the word of
[58:08] god it's a thought
[58:10] expressed the only way we know how god
[58:13] thinks is by his word and
[58:17] and satan took that word and he took the
[58:20] word when he tempted jesus and he said
[58:22] it's written it's written and satan said
[58:25] jesus said get behind me satan
[58:27] you're perverting the word of god he
[58:29] perverted the word of god in eden
[58:31] he perverted the word of god at the
[58:33] first exodus he's trying to pervert the
[58:35] word of god
[58:36] at this exodus
[58:40] and put it on your mind can there's only
[58:43] one thing that can
[58:44] fight that deception it's truth there's
[58:48] one
[58:49] answer to a lie and that's the truth
[58:55] that's why the unforgivable sin
[58:58] is to call the spirit of god veiled in
[59:01] flesh
[59:02] in this age doing the same signs and
[59:05] wonders that the lord did when he was
[59:07] here on earth
[59:08] delivering the true interpretation of
[59:11] god's word
[59:12] and to call that beelzebub and the devil
[59:15] there's no forgiveness for that in this
[59:18] life or the life to come
[59:21] why because you called the very thing
[59:23] the only thing
[59:25] that can save you not so
[59:30] then you've cut that off and you'll
[59:33] perish
[59:35] so he said so we
[59:38] we he said so they're now making their
[59:42] choice
[59:42] the holy spirit is here calling out a
[59:45] bride
[59:46] for christ
[59:49] so the words here the message is here
[59:52] calling you
[59:53] out calling a bride out
[59:56] reaching out don't think just because
[59:59] you've
[1:00:00] recognized that god sent a messenger
[1:00:04] and that the pillar of fire had
[1:00:07] come that the angels
[1:00:10] were caught in a cloud as it was
[1:00:13] prophesied
[1:00:15] that the statue of a perfect man is
[1:00:18] taking place
[1:00:19] and and you see those things that you've
[1:00:22] reached a place of knowledge that the
[1:00:25] call
[1:00:26] has stopped
[1:00:29] he's still calling us out he's still
[1:00:32] calling us to perfection as we said this
[1:00:35] morning he's got
[1:00:37] something for us that we've never seen
[1:00:39] before
[1:00:40] that's going to empower us to take the
[1:00:43] promise
[1:00:44] of the rapture
[1:00:48] rapturing faith so we've got to
[1:00:50] recognize he's not done
[1:00:52] calling me he's not done leading me
[1:00:55] i'm not cannot putting this message down
[1:00:58] and now it becoming a history book
[1:01:03] there's still a living voice to it
[1:01:06] a moving spirit to it a quickening
[1:01:09] power to it there's still revelation in
[1:01:12] it
[1:01:18] look he says here he says
[1:01:22] he says and the holy spirit is calling
[1:01:25] out a bride
[1:01:26] he is doing it by vindicating his word
[1:01:30] of promise to her
[1:01:32] for this age showing that
[1:01:35] it is christ
[1:01:40] that's how he's doing it that's how he's
[1:01:43] calling out a bride
[1:01:45] by showing the promise behold i'll send
[1:01:48] you elijah the prophet
[1:01:50] by vindicating it
[1:01:54] and by showing
[1:01:57] i promise to her for this age
[1:02:00] showing that it is christ
[1:02:05] that's the revelation that he manifests
[1:02:08] and shows it's christ if
[1:02:12] he said the spirit of god as it
[1:02:15] growed into the full stature of god in
[1:02:20] the age that we're now living in
[1:02:22] the holy spirit is here vindicating the
[1:02:25] message of the hour
[1:02:27] and the holy spirit is doing this so
[1:02:30] that
[1:02:30] the people that believe god will
[1:02:34] be called out of this
[1:02:37] chaos anybody see the same
[1:02:41] chaos i do the devil's unholy spirit
[1:02:45] is calling his church by the air
[1:02:48] as usual by perversion of the word of
[1:02:52] god
[1:02:53] like he did at the beginning see coming
[1:02:56] right back again to seed
[1:02:58] time again for eden is here
[1:03:02] again oh
[1:03:06] eden is here again
[1:03:10] wouldn't it only be just if god's bride
[1:03:14] had
[1:03:14] failed by rejecting the word
[1:03:19] that she would be restored again
[1:03:24] and not accept his lie
[1:03:28] but this time prove that she is true to
[1:03:32] her vow
[1:03:34] prove that she's accepted what god's
[1:03:36] done in this generation
[1:03:38] to make her stand with the scriptures
[1:03:41] and with the revealed
[1:03:43] vindicated word of god and therefore
[1:03:46] she's
[1:03:46] she's proven
[1:03:49] that through her union with the lord
[1:03:52] she's been cleansed
[1:03:54] and made whole and put on the right robe
[1:03:57] of
[1:03:58] marriage and now has made herself ready
[1:04:01] for the marriage of the lamb it only
[1:04:04] makes sense
[1:04:07] let's don't get this thing in religious
[1:04:09] realms
[1:04:10] this is spiritual resurrection the
[1:04:13] resurrection
[1:04:14] is on the transformation is taking place
[1:04:19] the calling is here but we had to have
[1:04:22] this condition
[1:04:24] of the world in order to meet the
[1:04:27] challenge
[1:04:28] of keeping our vow in other words this
[1:04:31] is the same
[1:04:32] devil that was in eden
[1:04:36] offering his tree of knowledge
[1:04:40] to her
[1:04:44] and now she's received the word
[1:04:48] brought to her by a divine messenger
[1:04:53] and prophet the message delivered to her
[1:04:57] just like the message was delivered to
[1:05:00] mary
[1:05:01] yes you shall be
[1:05:06] impregnated with the word of god
[1:05:10] and something should be in you the
[1:05:13] redeemer
[1:05:14] and now we've received the word of god
[1:05:17] that
[1:05:18] in the spiritual type one being the
[1:05:20] natural
[1:05:21] this bride this mary she receives the
[1:05:24] word of god
[1:05:25] and she becomes totally part of that
[1:05:28] word of god
[1:05:29] and they become one and satan's trying
[1:05:31] to lie to her
[1:05:32] and keep her he and so we find
[1:05:36] out he says now notice then
[1:05:39] the beast that was come upon the earth
[1:05:43] would deceive all whose names were not
[1:05:46] put
[1:05:47] in the lamb's book of life slain
[1:05:50] before the foundation of the world in
[1:05:53] god's own thinking
[1:05:55] god the great spirit in the beginning
[1:05:58] before there was a beginning
[1:06:00] he was god and did you know
[1:06:04] you were in him then
[1:06:07] if you are a christian now you was in
[1:06:10] him
[1:06:11] then so that's why he didn't destroy
[1:06:14] that the flood
[1:06:15] because you were if and then and you had
[1:06:18] to be manifested
[1:06:20] and then if that be so
[1:06:24] the whole godhead bodily shaped up
[1:06:27] in the person of jesus christ and then
[1:06:30] when jesus died at the cross
[1:06:34] i died with him for i was
[1:06:37] in him then for he was the fullness of
[1:06:43] the word manifested knowing
[1:06:46] that we would be
[1:06:49] manifested later
[1:06:54] now knowing we would be manifested
[1:06:58] now here we are and he and we was at
[1:07:02] calvary with him
[1:07:03] he went to the grave with him and we
[1:07:05] raised with him
[1:07:07] in his resurrection and are now ascended
[1:07:10] by his spirit into the throne of grace
[1:07:13] sitting together in heavenly places in
[1:07:16] christ jesus
[1:07:18] amen as the germ of natural life
[1:07:21] is brought down the germanization of
[1:07:24] father
[1:07:24] to father to father to father and
[1:07:27] so is the life of christ germatized
[1:07:31] that's the reason god uses eliza spirit
[1:07:34] five times
[1:07:35] what is it it's the handing down
[1:07:38] the germatizing amen john the baptist
[1:07:42] germatized the people behold there's one
[1:07:45] sitting among you
[1:07:47] whose sandals i'm not worthy to loosen
[1:07:51] i baptize you with water but he'll
[1:07:53] baptize you with fire
[1:07:55] you see the passing down the passage now
[1:07:58] now the spirit of an elijah
[1:07:59] in our day came and passes down to us
[1:08:03] the true unadulterated resurrected word
[1:08:07] so that resurrection can come in us
[1:08:10] and we can partake
[1:08:13] in a rapture
[1:08:16] because it's our only hope the
[1:08:19] revelation of the manifestation
[1:08:22] of the promise just as your natural life
[1:08:25] and traits is handed down from the
[1:08:27] natural breeding of your father
[1:08:30] so is the spirit of god that was
[1:08:32] predestinated
[1:08:33] before the foundation of the world and
[1:08:36] when
[1:08:37] it the entire word of god incomplete
[1:08:41] was headed up in a human body called
[1:08:44] jesus christ
[1:08:46] in there god made me pay for my sins
[1:08:51] in him there then he rose me
[1:08:55] raised me up with him
[1:08:58] in the resurrection and now we are
[1:09:01] seated with him
[1:09:03] with power and authority over
[1:09:06] every devil
[1:09:09] now listen oh if you could
[1:09:12] only believe what god has given
[1:09:19] satan's whole job is to discredit the
[1:09:20] word of god
[1:09:22] because do you understand what he has
[1:09:25] given if we could only
[1:09:26] realize what was given
[1:09:30] if we could recognize what he's done for
[1:09:33] us
[1:09:35] if we could recognize the day and its
[1:09:37] message
[1:09:38] he says
[1:09:41] the authority oh if we could only
[1:09:44] believe
[1:09:45] what god has given but if you're not
[1:09:48] seated there
[1:09:49] you don't have it and if you're seated
[1:09:53] there
[1:09:53] and don't believe it or afraid to move
[1:09:58] you'll never use it
[1:10:03] i honestly believe church and i hope all
[1:10:07] the messages i've been preaching since
[1:10:09] we've been in this
[1:10:10] whole thing has all about being about
[1:10:14] the church
[1:10:15] getting active the church
[1:10:18] coming to life the church getting
[1:10:20] involved the church carrying out its
[1:10:22] commission
[1:10:25] we've got the greatest powerful message
[1:10:27] in the world and
[1:10:28] and he's got us back in a corner
[1:10:35] he's he's he's he's put the old boogie
[1:10:38] man
[1:10:38] on us and said
[1:10:42] there will be a consequence if you use
[1:10:45] it
[1:10:47] you'll be socially incorrect
[1:10:54] you know you can't say mrs or mr
[1:10:57] it's not mailman anymore it's
[1:11:00] male person
[1:11:06] well i don't mind saying male lady
[1:11:10] you know what i mean but
[1:11:13] that's not politically correct
[1:11:16] and we could go down the list and we can
[1:11:18] go down the list
[1:11:19] we're afraid can you imagine getting so
[1:11:23] bad
[1:11:24] that you won't put the gender of your
[1:11:26] child on a birth certificate
[1:11:29] because you're dumb enough to believe
[1:11:31] that they have a choice
[1:11:37] i mean that's stupid
[1:11:42] you know that's stupid
[1:11:45] alls it is is
[1:11:48] is preparing that child
[1:11:52] to take on a sodom and gomorrah in
[1:11:55] spirit
[1:11:58] i mean you're not a man or you're not a
[1:12:01] woman
[1:12:01] you make that choice later
[1:12:06] yeah we've heard that message before
[1:12:10] you know what the result of that message
[1:12:12] was fire and brimstone
[1:12:14] and that's what's coming again that is
[1:12:17] absolutely ignorant
[1:12:21] but you see how they're conditioning you
[1:12:23] see how they're fighting
[1:12:24] you see how they're preparing
[1:12:29] you know what that community hates more
[1:12:31] than anything
[1:12:32] is when you tell them you know that's a
[1:12:34] spirit
[1:12:35] and you can be delivered from it and you
[1:12:37] can be set free
[1:12:40] oh no god made us this way
[1:12:45] god made us this way so the earth
[1:12:46] wouldn't become overpopulated
[1:12:49] god made us this way and the bible tells
[1:12:53] us leaving the natural use
[1:12:55] of a woman burning in their own lust
[1:12:59] man with man working that which is
[1:13:01] unseemingly
[1:13:02] because god had given over to a
[1:13:04] reprobate mind i'll tell you what god's
[1:13:06] solution
[1:13:06] for the population problem is it's the
[1:13:09] resurrection
[1:13:11] that's what his solution is god's
[1:13:14] solution
[1:13:15] for everything that's going on is
[1:13:18] the rapture that's god's answer
[1:13:24] i'll take you out
[1:13:28] when it gets too evil for you to bear
[1:13:31] i'll take you out
[1:13:35] well satan's poisoning us by candy
[1:13:37] coating it
[1:13:40] making us anemic
[1:13:43] making us where we don't use the power
[1:13:46] of god
[1:13:48] and he's just working away at us you
[1:13:50] know and
[1:13:52] he says but he said but if you're seated
[1:13:55] there
[1:13:57] you will use it and if you're
[1:14:01] ordained to do it what you do
[1:14:06] so we see this great uh
[1:14:09] great deception that goes on
[1:14:12] now because satan has an ambition
[1:14:16] there's a reason why he's doing what
[1:14:19] he's doing
[1:14:20] remember two spirits one's the spirit of
[1:14:23] god
[1:14:24] and god can only work by the eternal
[1:14:28] plan that he put in place
[1:14:31] because that has an end and that end has
[1:14:34] already been spoken
[1:14:36] and he can't deviate from the end
[1:14:40] which he spoke into existence and when
[1:14:43] he spoke it in the beginning
[1:14:45] he knew the timing by which he would
[1:14:49] bring
[1:14:49] every stage of that plan to pass and
[1:14:53] how it would come to pass everything's
[1:14:55] in
[1:14:56] perfect in tune with god everything's a
[1:14:58] hundred percent online
[1:15:00] so god in the beginning predestinated
[1:15:02] you thought the
[1:15:03] the plan chose the age that he would put
[1:15:06] you in
[1:15:07] chose the part that you would manifest
[1:15:09] chose the part that luther would
[1:15:11] manifest and his believers
[1:15:13] wesley the restoration of the gifts
[1:15:16] every part of it's planned by god
[1:15:19] but you don't play any of those other
[1:15:21] parts you're the astronaut
[1:15:24] church you're the blast-off
[1:15:27] church you're the church that goes past
[1:15:29] the moon and beyond
[1:15:34] satan had his greatest achievement
[1:15:38] shooting man from the earth and putting
[1:15:40] them in space that's man's greatest
[1:15:42] achievement
[1:15:43] is a man on the moon that's what they
[1:15:47] claim
[1:15:49] well god's achievements way past the
[1:15:50] moon
[1:15:52] you know see you soon
[1:15:58] but satan's got an ambition it was
[1:16:01] satan's ambition
[1:16:02] to be worshipped like god
[1:16:06] he took two-thirds of the stars of
[1:16:10] heaven
[1:16:11] ascended himself above those stars
[1:16:14] and preached to them and deceived
[1:16:17] two-thirds of them
[1:16:20] you see it all right notice that's his
[1:16:24] ambition
[1:16:25] now he is ready with his carefully
[1:16:28] selected
[1:16:30] educated bride by his own knowledge
[1:16:35] see all the painted up in his deceit
[1:16:39] of big buildings and big denominations
[1:16:43] and paints of knowledge and theology
[1:16:47] and smart and intellectual and educated
[1:16:50] to deceive the whole
[1:16:53] world and become
[1:16:57] a god that's what
[1:17:00] he's done he deceived the whole thing
[1:17:05] thinking that civilization civilization
[1:17:08] is good
[1:17:09] and education is good and science is
[1:17:12] good it's all alive
[1:17:18] that's what he's done all headed up
[1:17:21] in the person of the antichrist which is
[1:17:24] already
[1:17:25] crowned the vicar of god
[1:17:31] that's mr p-o-p-e
[1:17:37] the big potato
[1:17:41] it's what it is
[1:17:45] and now we see him coming out
[1:17:48] oh it's okay it's okay my children
[1:17:53] it's all right you can do that totally
[1:17:56] contrary to the word of god
[1:17:59] the scripture says it's an abomination
[1:18:01] now
[1:18:02] god headed up with all this science and
[1:18:06] education the god of this world
[1:18:08] sitting on the throne now condones
[1:18:13] all the worldly nonsense
[1:18:18] and says it's now under my
[1:18:21] throne
[1:18:24] i am now bringing god to your
[1:18:28] nonsense this
[1:18:31] is what's just this is what's right
[1:18:39] he said
[1:18:42] he says to become god he set it all up
[1:18:46] in in the person of the antichrist
[1:18:50] the vicar of god but his
[1:18:54] worldly loving scientific bride
[1:18:57] all dressed up in pomp of intelligence
[1:19:02] religious education she's made
[1:19:05] religious like him
[1:19:08] and by his own interpretation of the
[1:19:11] word of god
[1:19:12] as he did eve and his
[1:19:15] son cain
[1:19:19] he educated him
[1:19:22] he told them what the bible meant and
[1:19:25] he's still doing it
[1:19:27] he's still educating the church world
[1:19:29] what the bible means
[1:19:30] and there's a divine interpretation of
[1:19:33] the bible
[1:19:34] vindicated by the power of the
[1:19:36] resurrection and that's the
[1:19:38] only interpretation
[1:19:42] i am the way the truth the life no man
[1:19:45] comes to the father
[1:19:46] but by me nobody has any right
[1:19:50] to provide another way to the throne
[1:19:54] besides the shed blood of jesus christ
[1:19:58] and the shed blood of jesus christ
[1:20:02] separates you from unbelief
[1:20:07] because if you take his life the life
[1:20:10] that was in the blood
[1:20:12] in you it'll make you christ light
[1:20:15] and the spirit of god believes every
[1:20:17] word
[1:20:18] of god how can the spirit of god deny
[1:20:22] the word of god church there's something
[1:20:25] going on now the battle is on
[1:20:30] armageddon is here
[1:20:34] he's riding on this big uh
[1:20:38] white horse and his big pale horse
[1:20:41] deceiving going out deceiving and
[1:20:43] deceiving
[1:20:45] so it's going right on and that's
[1:20:49] exactly
[1:20:50] what it is he says this is choosing day
[1:20:54] either live for the day and die
[1:20:58] choose god and live and god is the word
[1:21:02] and the word is the word
[1:21:06] manifested for the hour
[1:21:09] and the day and let me tell you
[1:21:13] that's why people can act like
[1:21:17] they they you know oh i believe the
[1:21:20] message
[1:21:21] but they continually refer back
[1:21:26] to 2000 years ago
[1:21:30] they won't look at the word today
[1:21:33] they won't acknowledge
[1:21:36] that the almighty creator of heaven and
[1:21:40] earth
[1:21:41] returned in this day
[1:21:45] as he promised to put his foot on the
[1:21:48] land and the sea
[1:21:50] veiled in human flesh where man could
[1:21:53] see
[1:21:53] a man called william branham but the
[1:21:56] elected looked past the veil
[1:21:58] and saw that it was none other than
[1:22:00] jesus christ
[1:22:02] manifesting himself the same yesterday
[1:22:05] today and forever
[1:22:06] and if you don't believe that my friend
[1:22:10] and you're sitting under a ministry that
[1:22:11] don't recognize that
[1:22:13] you are deceived
[1:22:18] now call it god or call it the devil
[1:22:22] but if you're lukewarm i'll spill thee
[1:22:25] out of my mouth
[1:22:27] that's what's coming
[1:22:31] a bunch of lukewarm people that's what
[1:22:34] this move of satan's producing
[1:22:39] it's producing lukewarm
[1:22:43] that's all it's doing
[1:22:46] oh i would that you'd either be hot or
[1:22:48] cold but if you're lukewarm i'll spill
[1:22:51] thee out of my mouth
[1:22:54] and if you're afraid to confess me
[1:22:56] before man
[1:22:58] i'm afraid to confess you before my
[1:23:01] father
[1:23:02] you could play a tape in every service
[1:23:04] and never
[1:23:06] testify to what god's done in this day
[1:23:09] that's right
[1:23:11] but only the elect can
[1:23:15] he's your awful i base my salvation on
[1:23:18] that
[1:23:22] our salvation be should be based
[1:23:26] on the manifested word of god for our
[1:23:28] age
[1:23:30] you can't build an ark
[1:23:33] and float out of here
[1:23:38] you've got to be hid in the protection
[1:23:42] of god's message
[1:23:45] you remember the story this morning
[1:23:47] about the calf
[1:23:49] who's sitting there feeding on the
[1:23:51] things of god and he's all
[1:23:54] full and kicking up his heels full of
[1:23:56] vitamins because he's feasted
[1:23:58] in the barn the storehouse
[1:24:01] and he comes out on display and that old
[1:24:04] skinny weeded thing looks over there and
[1:24:06] goes
[1:24:06] such fanaticism
[1:24:10] such fanaticism to believe god veiled
[1:24:12] himself in flesh
[1:24:14] such fanaticism to believe that the
[1:24:16] works that
[1:24:17] he did we should do also such fanaticism
[1:24:21] to think that you're the elected lady
[1:24:23] such fanaticists are such fanaticism
[1:24:27] we got jesus we've got jesus
[1:24:33] just give me jesus where is he
[1:24:37] amen he's dwelling
[1:24:42] there's a union that's been taking place
[1:24:44] an invisible union between a heavenly
[1:24:47] bridegroom and an earthly bride there's
[1:24:49] been a oneness that has taken place
[1:24:52] where that word that will had arose and
[1:24:54] ascended
[1:24:55] had returned back on the day of
[1:24:57] pentecost went
[1:24:58] into the ground and then god's been
[1:25:01] counting back up
[1:25:02] through the church ages to where it
[1:25:04] comes into full maturity
[1:25:06] and they become one again
[1:25:10] and they did that through a message
[1:25:13] that was preached so they had something
[1:25:17] to become one with
[1:25:23] so you're not one with your own
[1:25:25] interpretation you're not one with your
[1:25:27] own mind
[1:25:28] you're not one with your own a moral
[1:25:31] standard
[1:25:32] you're not one with your own prophecy
[1:25:34] you've got to become
[1:25:35] one with the one
[1:25:39] that came up through the church ages and
[1:25:42] manifested himself in this
[1:25:44] age veiled in flesh standing with us
[1:25:47] to be recognized by those who are
[1:25:49] elected to see it
[1:25:51] and that's what they become what they
[1:25:53] become one with the word
[1:25:55] that he preached not one with the
[1:25:58] history
[1:26:02] because the others the god of this evil
[1:26:05] age
[1:26:06] in deception
[1:26:15] he says the choosing day
[1:26:18] he he says the day
[1:26:23] the day what do you call it
[1:26:26] man's day for
[1:26:30] you would say it's the day that the
[1:26:32] works
[1:26:33] by knowledge of man is glorified
[1:26:38] that's why it's man's day the works that
[1:26:41] man
[1:26:41] has done is glorified look at how i
[1:26:45] negotiated such a beautiful peace
[1:26:52] oh low low they'll say peace and safety
[1:26:55] and then shall come sudden destruction
[1:27:00] you know if somebody hates your guts
[1:27:05] for a lot of years and they've been
[1:27:08] wanting to take you out
[1:27:11] and all of a sudden they sit down with a
[1:27:13] grin and smile on their face say oh well
[1:27:15] let's just be buddies
[1:27:18] you better make sure they've been born
[1:27:19] again
[1:27:22] and the old man has passed away and all
[1:27:25] things have become new
[1:27:27] and that they're sitting in heavenly
[1:27:29] places in christ jesus
[1:27:34] or they're just sitting there like a
[1:27:37] mule
[1:27:38] who laid his whole life just to kick you
[1:27:43] all this world is all
[1:27:47] shouting for joy because
[1:27:50] israel is making all these agreements
[1:27:53] with all these people that hate her guts
[1:27:57] they believe they're living in their
[1:27:59] land
[1:28:02] and they've got a temple
[1:28:07] that they need to build for muhammad
[1:28:11] to come back in
[1:28:15] and why do you think they want peace
[1:28:18] because they think
[1:28:19] peace is better for the end that they're
[1:28:22] trying to reach
[1:28:26] we are headed for some chaos
[1:28:29] in this world
[1:28:34] i'm sorry i got sidetracked
[1:28:39] because a man's is glorifying his own
[1:28:42] knowledge
[1:28:43] and the world today is
[1:28:46] dedicated themselves to the knowledge
[1:28:50] which came by satan and man's day
[1:28:53] is glorified not by the word of god
[1:28:58] but by the knowledge that he has
[1:29:02] now think let that soak in
[1:29:05] and when you play this tape back
[1:29:09] on this point stop for a while
[1:29:13] and think
[1:29:17] everything's about education
[1:29:19] everything's about science
[1:29:21] everything's about what we've
[1:29:23] accomplished everything what we do
[1:29:25] there's nothing about the power of god
[1:29:29] that's available to us
[1:29:35] do you understand that they're not
[1:29:38] preaching
[1:29:38] we've got a god in heaven that'll take
[1:29:42] care of us
[1:29:43] that loves us that we can call on you
[1:29:46] israel used to call on the name of the
[1:29:49] lord
[1:29:50] and what would they do they would hear
[1:29:54] plagues they would come under captivity
[1:29:56] they would be
[1:29:57] they would lose everything their crops
[1:29:59] their rain and everything
[1:30:00] god would bring a prophet up and say
[1:30:02] you've turned your way
[1:30:04] repent turn back to god call on the lame
[1:30:07] of god
[1:30:07] they'd scream out to god calling god god
[1:30:10] would have mercy on him
[1:30:11] because he had a promise to fulfill
[1:30:16] and he would restore him back
[1:30:20] you know why they don't call on god
[1:30:23] they don't want to have no promise
[1:30:27] left
[1:30:32] you know who's got the promise left the
[1:30:35] elect
[1:30:36] lady
[1:30:40] i'm sorry friends the world has
[1:30:43] no promise left
[1:30:46] from god but destruction
[1:30:52] that's it
[1:30:57] there's only one promise for god to
[1:31:00] fulfill that's to call his elect lady
[1:31:04] to have that elect lady go out and clean
[1:31:07] the fields
[1:31:09] to find the last one that she can come
[1:31:12] in
[1:31:13] and receive the resurrection life then
[1:31:16] this
[1:31:17] lady is leaving
[1:31:22] and that's the final showdown that will
[1:31:25] prove
[1:31:25] that satan is a dead-faced
[1:31:28] bald-faced pony soldier liar amen
[1:31:34] end the story come on brother gary
[1:31:37] preach something
[1:31:38] nicer there's nothing nicer
[1:31:41] but if you're elect you're you're
[1:31:44] you're praising god hallelujah i got the
[1:31:47] promise
[1:31:48] i saw the message it quick and deceited
[1:31:51] me
[1:31:51] i see it i believe it i've experienced
[1:31:55] the power of it
[1:31:58] give me the strength to use it lord lord
[1:32:01] help my unbelief
[1:32:06] he says let that soak in when you play
[1:32:08] this tape think about it so
[1:32:10] we got the word right here to go back
[1:32:13] and play the tape
[1:32:15] his works are exalted above god's word
[1:32:21] and manifested works the wisdom of satan
[1:32:26] which he give to eve at the beginning
[1:32:30] now listen don't miss this the wisdom of
[1:32:33] satan
[1:32:33] is exalted to the throne of worship
[1:32:37] in man above the vindicated word of god
[1:32:42] for the hour
[1:32:45] our churches prove that
[1:32:48] by their seminary schools of learning
[1:32:53] that learn more than god's word knows
[1:32:57] about it
[1:33:00] they know more than god does
[1:33:04] they know how to go about doing it a
[1:33:06] different way than god did it
[1:33:08] god's never changed his way repent
[1:33:12] or perish be baptized in the name of the
[1:33:16] lord jesus christ for the forgiveness of
[1:33:18] your sins
[1:33:19] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:33:22] ghost
[1:33:22] this your seal until the day of
[1:33:25] redemption
[1:33:26] to keep you from the wiles of the devil
[1:33:40] they think they learn more than god word
[1:33:43] knows about it they think and there's
[1:33:46] doctors so and so
[1:33:48] and teachers so and so and professor
[1:33:50] so-and-so
[1:33:51] has exalted their own knowledge so
[1:33:54] called from satan truth
[1:33:58] above the vindicated promise of god
[1:34:01] made clear right before them and
[1:34:05] man fall for it
[1:34:11] all these guys all these teachers
[1:34:16] they're teaching their own revelation
[1:34:20] and here's an angel
[1:34:24] sent from god raised up
[1:34:28] the angel of the lord meets them tells
[1:34:31] him he's got a work for him to do
[1:34:33] tells him what the work will do tells
[1:34:35] him how he'll take the hand tells him
[1:34:36] how he'll discern the thoughts and
[1:34:38] intents
[1:34:38] tells him how that he'll break the
[1:34:40] mysteries of the seals and reveal the
[1:34:42] son of perdition
[1:34:44] reveal the god of this evil age
[1:34:48] reveal satan's eden
[1:34:51] to reveal the ladies in spirit
[1:34:54] and be totally vindicated and
[1:34:57] it happens
[1:35:02] but they've exalted themselves above the
[1:35:04] message
[1:35:07] now you say you call them christians you
[1:35:09] can't call them anything else
[1:35:10] but christians but they're anointed ones
[1:35:14] at the end time
[1:35:17] the anointing's right but their message
[1:35:20] is false
[1:35:21] because the rain falls on the just and
[1:35:23] the unjust
[1:35:25] that's how he deceives them
[1:35:29] he appears as an angel of light
[1:35:33] and it would deceive the very elected at
[1:35:36] possible
[1:35:36] do you understand god's going to bring
[1:35:38] you to the place where you've got to
[1:35:39] throw all your eggs in one basket
[1:35:43] this is the days of ananias and sapphira
[1:35:47] if you're holding back a little
[1:35:53] that little leaven will leaven the whole
[1:35:56] lump
[1:35:58] it'll start leveling your decisions
[1:36:01] it'll start
[1:36:02] leavening where you go what you do
[1:36:04] you'll end up working on sundays you'll
[1:36:06] end up
[1:36:08] putting tv in your house you'll end up
[1:36:09] doing all this stuff
[1:36:13] because you're not sold out
[1:36:16] you haven't seen what god's done
[1:36:20] we haven't seen the god of this evil age
[1:36:24] manifested and i've never seen an hour
[1:36:29] like this what's going on in this
[1:36:32] country what's going on in this world
[1:36:36] what's going on under this plague
[1:36:39] and the effect that it's having
[1:36:43] i've never seen a sign of deception
[1:36:47] like this time of
[1:36:50] deception that they fall for it let's
[1:36:52] close
[1:36:54] now let's watch it be manifested
[1:36:58] he says he is making a better world
[1:37:01] for them to live in
[1:37:05] by his knowledge apart from the never
[1:37:09] failing word of god
[1:37:12] but by his coming together in
[1:37:15] denominations and creeds and
[1:37:17] intellectual and science
[1:37:20] and so forth he's making a better world
[1:37:24] for man to live in
[1:37:26] and ignoring the promises of
[1:37:32] god
[1:37:34] and ignoring the promises of god i mean
[1:37:37] just look at
[1:37:38] what the campaign slogans are and how do
[1:37:41] you know you know civilization moved
[1:37:43] from east to west
[1:37:45] so america is the host and the
[1:37:49] manifestation
[1:37:50] of satan's eden
[1:37:56] revelations 13.
[1:37:59] it came over here under a religious
[1:38:01] pretense
[1:38:04] of serving god and freedom of religion
[1:38:08] and in 200 years has went
[1:38:12] farther from god than all the 6 000
[1:38:15] years
[1:38:16] of civilization before it and look at
[1:38:19] their mottos
[1:38:22] make america great again
[1:38:27] there's only one person that can make
[1:38:29] america great
[1:38:30] and that's god and god ain't gonna do it
[1:38:35] sorry god ain't gonna do it
[1:38:38] prophet of god says it's a filthy
[1:38:40] stinking urinal
[1:38:41] in his nose
[1:38:45] he's done with it
[1:38:50] and what's the other one
[1:38:53] build back better they're saying the
[1:38:58] same thing
[1:39:03] can you imagine telling the same lie
[1:39:06] with two different stories
[1:39:11] oh the one's going to make you rich more
[1:39:14] money in your 40k
[1:39:16] more money in your bank account more
[1:39:18] jobs well that's lady osea
[1:39:21] blind miserable poor wretched and naked
[1:39:23] and don't think they need nothing
[1:39:28] you know the other one's going to bring
[1:39:29] you under their educational system and
[1:39:31] their government system
[1:39:32] and their mark of the beast it's the
[1:39:34] same spirit
[1:39:37] pick your devil
[1:39:41] that's all it is
[1:39:44] and one things they're picking the right
[1:39:45] and the other ones think they're picking
[1:39:47] the right and they tell people tell me
[1:39:48] why they voted for this guy and
[1:39:50] the other person tells me why they're
[1:39:51] vote guy and i thought wait a minute
[1:39:55] i think there's another candidate in
[1:39:57] another party
[1:39:59] somewhere there's someplace else for us
[1:40:02] to put our vote
[1:40:05] but not in this chaos but listen what
[1:40:08] they do
[1:40:09] okay god he says
[1:40:12] make better world for man to live in and
[1:40:14] ignoring the promises of god
[1:40:17] that the only time the world will be fit
[1:40:20] to live
[1:40:21] in is in the millennium you know my
[1:40:25] opinion

[1:40:29] instead of living no faith
[1:40:33] right no use of the promises of god
[1:40:38] he ignores the promises of god why
[1:40:41] doesn't our country use
[1:40:42] the promises of god instead of over here

[1:40:46] ho2 clinic where you can go get tested
[1:40:49] for free
[1:40:50] if you want to find out whether you're

[1:41:36] grapevine highway whatever it's called
[1:41:39] and they'll be laying hands on the sick

[1:45:08] can anybody tell me what they know about
[1:45:10] satan
[1:45:11] he is a liar
[1:45:16] and there is no
[1:45:19] truth in him

[1:46:44] or because of your education because
[1:46:46] you're hispanic and everything that
[1:46:48] persecution is going to come down to

[1:46:52] and you're going to keep god's word and
[1:46:53] you're not going to compromise god's
[1:46:55] word
[1:46:56] then you'll be persecuted then they will

[1:47:51] gets a revelation and the full knowledge
[1:47:54] of words god

[1:50:07] lousy 2 000 square foot three thousand
[1:50:10] square foot every square foot you live
[1:50:12] in
[1:50:14] believe it or not you only live in a
[1:50:15] little inch
[1:50:18] right in here but why sacrifice for
[1:50:22] something that's going to be destroyed
[1:50:28] why put yourself under burden
[1:50:31] instead of being content
[1:50:35] we're doing it it's going on
[1:50:38] it's happening the backsliding is on
[1:50:45] that's the effect of this world is to
[1:50:48] get this church
[1:50:49] to backslide
[1:50:53] and it's had its effect
[1:50:57] but i believe the gospel that's been
[1:50:59] preached by a messenger
[1:51:01] has starting to come to the church and

[1:51:30] you
[1:51:33] you don't use it you get cold
[1:51:39] a cactus used to be something with

[1:51:48] thistles over there
[1:51:52] she keeps free of him now let's talk
[1:51:56] about her a minute she waits for her
[1:51:59] lord
[1:52:00] and his millennium honeymoon right with
[1:52:04] the word groom as she is
[1:52:07] the word bride knowledge and
[1:52:10] civilization
[1:52:12] and true christianity has nothing
[1:52:15] in common civilization
[1:52:18] and true christianity has not one
[1:52:22] thing in
[1:52:25] common
[1:52:29] i think it's purging time
[1:52:32] sorry if i took long i'm sorry if i got
[1:52:34] carried away
[1:52:36] but i'm telling you something's got to
[1:52:42] change
[1:52:44] i mean this thing has got us down to 25
[1:52:46] 30 people in church
[1:52:51] we're afraid you know my letter
[1:52:55] that i wrote was
[1:52:59] for you to make a decision
[1:53:06] you know i it's not us to keep you away
[1:53:10] it was to give you a way out
[1:53:13] if you didn't want to come to church
[1:53:15] here's 25 reasons
[1:53:18] why you don't have to come
[1:53:22] the only group that i set aside
[1:53:25] is that high risk group
[1:53:28] of 65 and above and i thank god
[1:53:32] i've tested many time and i'm negative
[1:53:36] i thank god for that because i'm in
[1:53:38] contact with a lot of people
[1:53:42] but the decision is going to be how are
[1:53:45] you going to go forward
[1:53:49] how long this thing
[1:53:54] is whole purpose of this is that's what
[1:53:57] he wants to do
[1:53:59] he you know the devil is trying to
[1:54:02] use science and
[1:54:05] and you know in to make this word
[1:54:09] of none effect
[1:54:14] we're going to have to realize something
[1:54:16] is going on
[1:54:18] it's affecting our thinking it's
[1:54:20] affecting our actions
[1:54:22] it's affecting what we do how we pray
[1:54:26] what times were taken the whole
[1:54:30] thing in the countdown was god had an
[1:54:33] achievement
[1:54:34] and satan has an achievement he's
[1:54:37] working his achievement
[1:54:40] he's achieving what he wants to do
[1:54:45] he's getting the believers into
[1:54:48] an in effectual condition
[1:54:54] he's succeeding
[1:54:58] and you don't think he's got any more
[1:55:01] bugs
[1:55:03] up his sleeve
[1:55:07] the whole world's going to be full of
[1:55:09] plagues there's going to be another
[1:55:11] plague after this one and another plague
[1:55:13] after that one and
[1:55:15] and they're going to come down to a time
[1:55:17] where and it's almost
[1:55:19] now they're actually preaching now
[1:55:22] that if you have children
[1:55:26] you're a curse to mankind
[1:55:30] and we've got sisters in our church that
[1:55:33] pray to god
[1:55:34] every day that they have a child
[1:55:39] and the world's killing them by the
[1:55:41] thousands
[1:55:44] and i don't even think we got a glimpse
[1:55:46] of how
[1:55:47] wicked and evil this time is
[1:55:51] that we're living in we've got soft
[1:55:55] and blinded
[1:55:58] we need to shake ourselves
[1:56:02] he's having his effect
[1:56:06] the god of this evil age has
[1:56:09] supplanted the word of god with
[1:56:13] knowledge
[1:56:14] science civilization and their
[1:56:17] worldly political leadership
[1:56:20] go read the seals
[1:56:27] political power and the power of the
[1:56:29] church
[1:56:30] joined together as one force and comes
[1:56:33] in this last day
[1:56:34] as a pale horse rider and deceives
[1:56:38] everybody nobody has a vision nobody
[1:56:42] knows which is right
[1:56:43] nobody can they become children not
[1:56:46] worthy of strong
[1:56:47] strong meat not being able to discern
[1:56:49] between good and evil
[1:56:52] he's working and what he's doing
[1:56:56] is working isn't it time what god
[1:57:00] is starts working isn't there a time for
[1:57:05] a people to cry out lord work the
[1:57:07] message in me
[1:57:09] work the message in me lord work the
[1:57:12] message in me

[1:57:17] that my works will glorify the father in
[1:57:20] heaven
[1:57:20] and lord let me go to an upper room
[1:57:23] somewhere
[1:57:26] let me shake off the influence of this
[1:57:28] world let me come alive
[1:57:30] oh god let the word of promise be on my
[1:57:36] lips
[1:57:38] i i i'm afraid for the church
[1:57:45] i'm afraid that that he's
[1:57:49] turning us into electronic church
[1:57:55] people don't come to service
[1:57:59] they plan church when they want to
[1:58:03] that's fine do what you want to do
[1:58:09] but some morning you won't be able to
[1:58:12] dial up the rapture

[1:58:18] to go so lord today's the
[1:58:20] time i want to go home here i'd like to

[1:59:14] then what what if it profiled a man to
[1:59:17] gain the whole world
[1:59:19] and lose his soul store up your
[1:59:22] treasures in heaven where they don't

[2:00:26] away from eden
[2:00:29] we've got a few glimpses in the
[2:00:31] mountains and we've got a few glimpses
[2:00:33] here and there
[2:00:36] but oh it hasn't even entered into our
[2:00:38] hearts the things that god's prepared
[2:00:40] for us

[2:00:45] to the message of the hour let's return
[2:00:48] to the absoluteness
[2:00:50] of the gospel in our lives

[2:00:57] the beautiful calling of god
[2:01:01] for us to come into action let's take it
[2:01:05] seriously
[2:01:06] and let's turn into that statue of a
[2:01:09] perfect man
[2:01:11] that he's wanting us to come into is
[2:01:13] that your heart's desire
[2:01:14] that's my heart's desire amen i'm not
[2:01:17] what i used to be
[2:01:21] and i'm thankful for that i'm not what i

[2:01:51] word of the hour
[2:01:54] let us pray
[2:02:01] i know some may listen to this
[2:02:06] sermon later because it's been recorded
[2:02:13] and i know the anointing doesn't follow
[2:02:17] the recordings like it is in the
[2:02:20] presence of the
[2:02:22] house of the lord but we know on the
[2:02:25] tapes that the anointing is still there
[2:02:29] because it's been predestinated to be
[2:02:31] there for the elect
[2:02:36] but if you're listening later
[2:02:39] [Music]
[2:02:41] i just ask you to take a moment to
[2:02:45] ask yourself what effect
[2:02:49] is this present evil
[2:02:55] having on your christian life
[2:02:59] and your walk
[2:03:02] what effect is it having on your
[2:03:04] attitude
[2:03:06] on your atmosphere on your disposition

[2:03:44] title it blast off time
[2:03:52] it's time for us to leave it's time for
[2:03:55] us to get ready
[2:03:58] it's time for us to look up because our
[2:04:00] redemption draws nigh
[2:04:03] it's time for us to be about the
[2:04:04] father's business
[2:04:06] it's time for us to carry out the
[2:04:08] commission it's time to get our loved
[2:04:11] ones in the ark
[2:04:16] it's time to call him in under the
[2:04:18] scarlet thread
[2:04:21] it's time to call him into the upper
[2:04:23] room
[2:04:24] to kneel down with someone and have them
[2:04:26] pray through
[2:04:28] how long has it been since you've knelt
[2:04:29] down with somebody and prayed through
[2:04:31] with them
[2:04:32] till they received the holy ghost
