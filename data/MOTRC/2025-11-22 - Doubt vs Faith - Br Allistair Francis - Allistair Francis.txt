TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So we are coming to a very important part of our faith. There's nothing else that can be the foundation of the temple of God. My point is knowledge cannot be a foundation. &gt;&gt; Love cannot be a foundation. &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness, not even virtue. Yes. &gt;&gt; Listen, a holy life lived according to the standards of the message cannot be a firm foundation. &gt;&gt; It will fail you. There is nothing else that can be a foundation for a perfect man. It has to be faith. Right? Now, we need to find that. So, there are basically five senses of the body, right? See, smell, taste, hear, touch. Agreed? Basically five senses. And then there are five basic senses of the spirit. But there are only two senses in the soul, &gt;&gt; right? And that's either faith or doubt. &gt;&gt; So you you can have only one of the two. If in or let me say this way, you should have only one of the two which is faith. &gt;&gt; The soul was made for faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? So that's where we we're coming to the second half of our teaching. Notice Jesus question, right? Uh uh Jesus question concerning faith or doubt. Uh how does this faith work then? Right? Do you doubt because you have little faith? Because he said, "Oh thou of little faith, wherefore did thou doubt?" So his question is, why did you doubt? &gt;&gt; What was the reason for you having doubt? You saw me? Don't you believe in me? Why did you doubt? So how does this work? Right? Do you doubt because you have little faith or do you have little faith because you doubt? Are you understanding my question? All right. So, we are going to do this through the entire teaching till we reach the top. We're going to take many months to get through this. Right? But the basic understanding is the growth of a child to manhood. From infancy to manhood, from infancy to maturity. Are you with me? Now when a baby is born there is zero doubt in him. Zero doubt. Okay. He has no doubt in him whatsoever. He only has faith and he has zero ability. He cannot walk. He cannot crawl. He cannot feed himself. He cannot roll over. He cannot pick his head up. He has zero doubt and zero ability. Can you imagine being that kind of person? That's how you start it off. Zero doubt, zero ability. Okay. So the first thing if you know a baby, the first thing in his development now obviously it would be wrong if a baby came out of the womb and started running around everywhere DOING EVERYTHING, GRABBING THIS, GRABBING. CAN YOU IMAGINE just being born in the first day, jump off the hospital bed, run around talking to the doctors, the nurses, teasing them, stealing stuff, running? That'll be crazy that you look at this and think this thing is possessed. Put it back. Right. That's wrong. You just can't do that. The baby is born with zero doubt, zero ability. Now uh for and then the first thing when he develops the okay so let me give you a little bit of science. So the baby starts to drink milk from the mother within the first week it has to rise in weight by half a kg 500 g. Agreed? If you go to clinics you go every every sort of 7 days and you weigh the baby. They check the height. They check all the parameters or all whatever it is and the the weight and they checking that the baby is literally gaining half a kg every week. That's a healthy baby. Why? What is happening? Whatever he's drinking is starting to give him ability. Within the first 3 weeks, you see him start to lift his neck. Like you can leave him on his back. When they're born, you leave them on their back, they can't move. They're so zero inability. they can die from their head being stuck in a in a mattress and they can't breathe. So that's why you got to take care of them and then they start getting ability to lift the neck because the food they're taking in is giving strength to the muscles which is the next step we come to is virtue which is ability. You'll see it right now. Let's move on. So this baby all he has is when he opens his eyes the doctors know this because this is scientific as well put the baby in the mother's arms and the child has to lock eyes with the baby I mean the the child has to lock eyes with the mother the mother lock eyes with the baby immediately the child recognizes the mother immediately faith this is mom he doesn't even know what's mom he doesn't know mother he doesn't know English he doesn't know zulu or any language he just locks eyes and knows This is you. I know you. I believe in you. And a smile opens up. Like the baby doesn't look at mom and you if if you ever witness it, it's the most amazing thing. The baby opens his eyes like struggling to open his eyes like this. And when he locks eyes with mom, you just see this smile, this alien looking smile, right? squashed up face like a prune and then smile and then this gurgle like it's so beautiful to watch, right? But um uh at that moment there's only faith. There's no doubt. This child is not going to open its eyes and and go, "Whoa, WHO ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?" There's no doubt. There's no reason to question. This child knows. I know you. You're taking care of me. You're the one I believe in. That's how it begins. It's faith. And what does he do from there? He got no speech. He can't talk. He can't articulate. He just says, and mom says, "Okay, he needs food." The next time he goes, and then mom says his nappy needs to be changed. He just cry. He just cries and things get done for him. That's faith. Zero ability, zero doubt. Just cry out to your heavenly father and things get done because he knows you're weak. &gt;&gt; You have no ability. All you got to have is faith, right? And then at first when they're little infants, everybody carries them. Is that right? The uncle, the aunt comes home. Can I carry him? Can I feed him? And yeah, he doesn't care. They stand, they hold him. They give him a bottle. They feed him. They change his nappy. He's letting them do everything. No problem. Within a few months, his eyes have recognized your mom, your dad. You I don't know. You I don't know. You smell funny. You smell funnier. You I don't like. What is that? That's knowledge coming in. Right. He started to recognize things. He started to recognize people. He knows his room. He knows the smells. That's and the moment knowledge starts coming in is when doubt starts coming in because now some that same uncle comes to pick him up and he says I don't want you right why because that's what knowledge does &gt;&gt; this is the problem with knowledge because and if you don't get the right knowledge knowledge is going to produce doubt so you THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T START WITH knowledge first. If you have knowledge first, you'll starve to death as a baby. Once he gets to know his parents, then he begins to distrust other people as his parents begin to teach him. Now, so remember this because we're going to speak about this. You're going to see this as the development of a human being. Isn't it amazing that this is in the Bible as a spiritual growth? It so matches the natural. So his parents begin to teach him. Now he's growing. And his parents teach him more knowledgeable. They'll tell him water. Water. Say water. What are they teaching him? What water is. When he when he gets to drink water, he's now teaching. He'll go water. So now he needs more ability, more knowledge. He's going to try and speak this. But when the next time he's not going to say ah and they give him water they're going to he's as he's GROWING HE GOES AH AND THEY SAY what do you want then he's going to go w then ah water why the knowledge has given him the ability to communicate he's developing &gt;&gt; but now he he's if he doesn't have faith in his parents to give him the water he won't use the knowledge to ask them for IT HAD TO HAVE STARTED WITH FAITH. &gt;&gt; Then the knowledge works. &gt;&gt; Amen. So now he begins to start questioning everything. He needs his parents by his side constantly because he's beginning to lose his faith he originally had. Right? Where once the child lived by instinct and faith, now he starts depending on knowledge. He wants to know everything. wants to stick his fingers in the plug socket. Even when they tell him don't do that, he wants to try. They tell him don't do that. He wants to do it. He Why? Because knowledge is taken over. He wants to know things, right? And so once before he lived just instinct and faith, now he's depending on knowledge and then fear steps in because knowledge brings fear as well. Why? because his parents will say, "DON'T DO THAT. YOU'LL GET HURT. STOP IT. YOU'LL FALL. DON'T DO THAT. YOU" AND HE'LL be like, you start literally seeing it take over his body. Trust me, when we get to this, you're going to know what I'm talking about. And you people, what makes you fear demon spirits? Why should you fear demons? Why should you fear witch doctors and evil things and evil paintings and all? Why should why should you fear those things? What made you fear? Someone told you a story. Someone gave you corrupt knowledge. Someone made you afraid of be afraid of things that go bump in the night. Someone made you afraid of darkness. They gave you the wrong knowledge. And in knowledge created fear and fear created doubt. You should be able to stand in pure darkness and not be afraid because what is it? It's just darkness. What's there to be afraid of, right? You know, if you want to train a child to be a to be not afraid of darkness, sit in a dark room with your child and play games. You ever thought of that? Then they get comfortable in there. Play games with them. Sit there and say, "Can you feel my hand? Can you feel my fingers? Can you feel my face? Can you see this? Then I'm moving to this corner of the room. You come and find me in the dark. And they love hide and seek. It's pitch dark. And then the next thing you know the fear. Why? You give them the right knowledge. But when you yourself and the lights go off AND YOU GO, "OH." That whole thing transfers to your child and your child gets terrified of darkness. H. We'll get to that. Trust me there's so much to what our ancestors and parents did to us. is crazy the amount of things you know among the Indian girls like don't go out in the night with your hair open the spirits will grab you know when a when a hearse goes by touch wood otherwise you go next you know I see them some of my cousins will be like the hearse will be going by they all run to touch some kind of wooden furniture like what is going on with you people oh No, you have to do that otherwise you die next. It's ridiculous. When you get the wrong knowledge, it produces fear and fear produces doubt. We're coming to why this is important. So knowledge brings fear and in some ways right let's let's bring a balance to this. If you tell a child do not put your hand on a hot stove, you are giving him knowledge. But then he's not really going to understand that because the knowledge does not become effective unless he gets burned once. When he gets burned, that's the truth of the knowledge you gave him. Now he's never going to touch that again. Unless he actually experiences heat and cold to understand it, to know the truth of it, it cannot be powerful to him. A person cannot live life just being lectured at. You have to experience it. So fear also brings wisdom of danger. Okay? Let's not trash fear. So it's in natural life, it's important for us to have fear. Like for example, if you're walking on ground that's unstable, if you have fear of unstable ground, then you'll sense it and you'll doubt the ground. You'll walk carefully. You'll do something to protect yourself. You'll preserve your life. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; However, when it comes to the word of God, one should not be cautious with God's promises. What's there to be cautious about? Our belief in him should be like instinct. Like this is father. &gt;&gt; He loves me. He'll provide for me. He knows what I need. I will not doubt him. Instinct. &gt;&gt; So when it comes to the word, we should not be cautious with God's promises. Our belief should be instinct. Worse than this is something that grew because of our love for knowledge. So everybody today, if you want to know why our world is crumbling, are you with me? It's because of the the love of knowledge. This the smartphone and the internet has created the love of knowledge and placed the love of knowledge above everything else. &gt;&gt; You are consuming knowledge at a rate like no other humans in the past. &gt;&gt; Every time you watch YouTube videos or listen to a podcast or read the news, read the internet, let me just give you an example. What if the newspapers only reported positive news every page? What would your life then be? Do you realize news only reports negative? &gt;&gt; Like and most of the headlines is something negative. It's something against the somebody died, some earthquake, some plane crash. So many lives were lost. Imagine if they reported every plane crash on the the front page. You'll never fly a plane because that knowledge on increase is going to give you fear and you'll never fly a plane. EVERY IF EVERY PAGE of the newspaper every day reports murders, you'll think South Africa is filled with murderers. like what the Americans think about us today, you know, that we are all murdering white people in the streets. It's just not true. It's not happening. Criminals are murdering all races in the streets. And and it's not even like that. You could we live such a normal life. Criminals are are very nervous characters who don't want to be seen. They want to come and steal something and disappear without getting caught. It's because we get brave and get in their way, we get killed. It's different from the actual hitmen who want to kill you because you have millions in your bank account and they know they can get something from you. So in this country, if you don't want to be targeted by a hitman, don't drive a Rolls-Royce and flash it around. Wear expensive clothing and show people how much money you have in your live simple, humble, no one will touch you. The same same thing everywhere in the world, right? But look at this idea. The news is only negative. And what does negative news produce? Doubt, fear, anger, political sides being chosen. Nobody tells you the good that men do. You know, and in one corner of the newspaper on one page, you find this old lady saved a dog. Yay. Nobody even sees that one good news article for the whole week. An old lady saved a dog. Okay. Risked her life to save a dog. Imagine if they stopped writing news about only politicians and governments. What if they told us things that every regular person What if news reporters went around reporting on regular things that that people like you and I would we be interested in it today? No. Today you are addicted to negative news. Today you want you're following somebody. You're following some guy. You're following what they what they're talking about Donald Trump. You're following what they're talking about surroa. You're following the politics of the country. You want to know. You'll actually not read that newspaper because it's not giving you enough news about that. You're addicted to negative news. You're addicted to drama. And what does it produce in your body? Negativity, argumentative nature, hostility, uh uh prejudice. It's what knowledge you're feeding is what is producing an actual reaction. You know, I I meet young people. You can meet them at universities. I pick up my son at university, meet some of their colleagues and meet some of their people and you just within 5 minutes you can already pick up this is not a happy person. This person has been indoctrinated with ideologies and and hate and nervousness and and all we are is one human to another. We've got the same red blood. We eat the same food. We live we walk in the same land. We're the same human beings. But what's your reason for distrusting my word? What's your reason for psychoanalyzing everything I got to say? Why can't we just take one another as human to human and appreciate who we are? Why? Because you're being fed negativity all your life. Why am I telling you this? What happens when you as a church are fed only one thing all the time? What happens to a message church when all you have is being corrected, corrected, corrected on the rules, the rules, the rules, the dressing, this, don't do this, don't do that. What do you think you're going to become? What what what if you are not being taught the goodness of God, the gracious graciousness of God, the the wealth, the richness in his word, the the word that teaches you what our behavior ought to be that challenges the fear and the doubt in your soul and brings light. See, we always want to know something about everything. We won't. And listen, all of us fall to this, right? You won't buy something unless you read the label. Am I right? And we don't understand. We don't even if we don't understand the label, we'll go to someone who works there and say, "This says this. What do you think about this? What do you recommend?" But you get some people who say, "Yeah, let's try it." Right? That doesn't mean those people have faith. And neither does the other person have faith. Let's try it. Is not faith. That's that's like risky behavior. That's like, well, there's a river there. There's a cliff here. Let's just jump off and see if it's deep enough for me to have a swim in. You're jumping from 30 m high. Let's just jump off and see if I live. That's stupidity. Okay. So we when we see those people who say ah let's try it we call them naive and reckless and immature but truthfully some people who will will be they probably live by instinct more than others like you so you get a lot of people who live by instinct they actually have a little bit more faith like you get people who will look down at the river and they'll see oh it's flowing quite fast that means it's quite deep and I can't see it And there's a certain color and this they are more in tune to their instincts than you are. And you look there for one, it's too high. I'm not doing this. I don't trust anything. Somebody will actually jump in and you'll see them falling. HEY, IT'S OKAY. YOU CAN JUMP. No way. I'm not doing it. I don't care whether you survive. I'm not doing this. You're just someone who doesn't even trust your own instincts, right? Because you've been brought up in a certain way. &gt;&gt; Yes. So we have become so dependent on knowledge that we doubt everything that we don't know about. To us that is natural and there is nothing wrong with that. So we live our lives being faith-based on our knowledge. That's the problem with the Christian church. You are telling yourself, you are basing your faith upon your knowledge. Your knowledge must be based on your faith. &gt;&gt; See, so if we know about something, then we won't doubt it. That's how we think. And then I'll have faith in it. Like that's so flawed because how do you know that what you know is actually right and it doesn't work? It never works. Right? we will even there now you you collect all this knowledge in and then you say okay now I understand it and now I want to base my faith on now I'm going to believe it because I understand it right and then you you say okay now I want to spread my faith I want to go tell people now you go and tell people and other people they listen to what you're saying they don't have all your knowledge but they think you're a fraud you don't really believe what you're Hey, and they're right because you base your faith on your knowledge. You don't have knowledge based on faith, which means they can tell, people can tell that your conviction is not real. This is how when a politician is speaking, giving a speech, when Sraapora is giving us a speech and we know, hey, come on, you can tell there's no conviction in there. when he says fellow South Africans everything is going to be all right right it doesn't matter what whether it's Emanuel Mccron from France whether it's Donald Trump from America wherever they are when they come out and give us a speech the moment they say good morning we know the first thing he's saying is a lie the way he's standing there what they came they put the flags behind they painted they put up a screen people only do that when they're not telling you the full truth Like why can't you tell the truth from wherever you are? Why do you need the whole setup to make you look like you are loyal to the flag to put the colors there to have certain important people like if you're coming to tell the people about the labor unions? You have labor labor union representatives there. Why must you have them there? To convince the people on the TV that I'm telling you the truth. Even these people agree with me. In the meantime, you paid them 10,000 rand each to be there. H right. What am I SAYING TO YOU? YOU got no knowledge, but you can tell you're a fraud. &gt;&gt; You has no conviction in you. You're you're knowledgeable. You're spouting all the right words in the legislature and the laws of the country and you're saying all the right things. You got the right catchphrases and you even know they've got these the little screens here. You know these teleprompterss where their words are flowing for them to just they're looking right and left and they're just reading things off a script and you know it's not even written by them. It's written by speech writers. So if you you're not even saying your own word, you're saying what your party wrote there for you to say. Who are you? You're a puppet. You're speaking words but you're not even you have no conviction over that's why I'm saying even to come here and preach a message and to go into chat GPT and say give me a message about you know statue of perfect man faith and he splits it out and then I come and preach from chat GPD I haven't even studied it I haven't even thought about I haven't even looked at it you'll know immediately this guy's a fraud you with me trust me that's going to happen a lot of people are already spouting sermons from Chad TPT. So we live our lives having faith based faith based on our knowledge and that's wrong. It's not it's not so with God. God needs to know that you can have faith and then he can give you knowledge. Just like that little baby once had faith and then knowledge came in. So does God require that of us. He begins our growth with faith AND ONLY THE THIRD STEP IS KNOWLEDGE. &gt;&gt; Even before that is virtue. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So when you have faith in him, do you uh only then can you really get to know God. So So let's put it back to this baby. All the baby knows is these two people, mom and dad. He still doesn't even know what their names are. For the first few years of your child's life, you are mommy and daddy. They don't know you. They don't know how you met. They don't know where you came from. They don't even they know grandma and grandpa. They don't even know how grandma and grandpa are connected to him to him or to you. They don't even know that's your that's daddy's father. That's mommy's father. They don't know that. They get zero knowledge on that. They just recognize you're a familiar person who comes to this house every day and gives me treats and tells me nice things and your name is grandpa or grandma. They have no connection to who you are in the family. They don't even know who their siblings are. The little baby grows up. This is his brother and sister. He doesn't even know who they are. There's no knowledge. All he has is ability to get along with them. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's going to get to know who they are over time. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's how it works. God's not even going to give you knowledge from the get- go. &gt;&gt; You need faith first. &gt;&gt; To have faith is to believe in something without proof. Amen. Believe in it without proof or reason or want of anything. Okay, let's get to doubt versus faith. Are you still with me? Believe me, we're more than halfway through. So, doubt is not a real thing. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just as death is not a real thing, life is real. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Death is the absence of life. Got it? If you see a a dead man, that's no longer a person. The person is gone. That that cannot even be identified. There's no identification. There's no life in it. It cannot speak. The dead body is is just now an empty shell. It is a nothing. It then becomes you put it in the ground, you put it in the furnace, it has gone into nothing. That death is nothing. Life is everything. &gt;&gt; Life is real. Light is real. What is darkness? It's the absence of light. &gt;&gt; What is doubt then? It's the absence of faith. &gt;&gt; How do we know that? Because when a baby is born, he starts off with faith first. Then is bad knowledge starts removing faith. And the absence of faith is doubt. Got it? That's the simple concept of it. Now let's test it. Truth is reality. Lies is not reality. Are we together? Do you understand? Is that clear? &gt;&gt; If someone lies to you about it, means it's not true. It means it doesn't exist. &gt;&gt; The truth actually exists. The lie is not real. &gt;&gt; So if someone said, "Brother Alistister said this," and if that's the truth, that's exactly what happened. But if they told you I said something that I did not, it it's not even real. It never even happened. The words they said that I said did not even go out into the ether. &gt;&gt; It's a lie. It never even happened. Are you with me? It's not reality. So what is a lie then? It's the absence of truth. &gt;&gt; Death is the absence of life. These are there there are real things. Love is real. uh life is real, truth is real. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And they have become now what's happened in in this world is you are being fed lies every day on the internet, in the newspapers, in religions. Is that right? And you are living by something. You are trying to put faith in something that is not real. It's not even true. And what's going to happen is everything that that is unreal is being posed to us as being the truth and being real being reality. So then what happens is it comes into us and uh because of doubt we start to accept things that are not real as if they are real. Let's make that plain. If somebody comes to you and lies to you about your brother or sister or family member and you believe the lie, what does it mean? What does it even mean that you believe the lie? Because it's not even real. &gt;&gt; What it means is you accepted it by knowledge and reasoning and you now are acting upon it to go and live by it. You're starting to live by something that is not real. That means you'll start if somebody comes and tells you that person said this about you and it's not real. You then will start living your life treating that person in a way as if they actually said something and that person is genuinely confused like why is that person not greeting me today? Why did they not shake my hand? Did I do something? Did I say something? And that and you're walking around like yeah I know what you said. &gt;&gt; You know this is how it's going to be. I'm not going to phone you. I'm not going to visit you. I'm not going to do anything from now on. You don't even You sit over there. I sit over here and it's not even reality. Amen. So what happens is someone gave you false knowledge and it's allowing doubt to enter in because faith is being removed. Knowledge does not necessarily mean truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes the knowledge that you receive is corrupt knowledge and it produces more doubt than it should. Are you with me? Let's read. Greatest battle ever fought. The great hour of charge is at hand. Hallelujah. Soldiers with with armor gleaming, color streaming, faith and doubt. I want you to see brother Madam is saying faith and doubt is set is setting themselves in array. Faith and doubt like two armies are setting themselves ready for battle in this tabernacle this morning. Doubt on one side, faith on the other side. Soldiers stand at your post of duty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our captain the morning star leads on. He never goes back. He don't know the word retreat. He don't have to retreat. Amen. The faith side does not retreat. The greatest battle ever fought is going on right now. Yes, sir. Between life and death, between sickness and hell, between faith and doubt. Oh my. Between liberty and bondage, the battle is on. Shine your spears, soldiers, polish up the armor. There is always been a war going on in our souls between doubt and faith. &gt;&gt; Since doubt is not a real thing, you cannot really get doubt out. You can only put faith in. &gt;&gt; You got it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. This is why the only thing you can actually place faith in is truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to expectancy. Message expectancy. Faith knows no defeat. Faith is perfect. Faith brings things when there is no things to be brought. Faith creates. Faith takes doubt away. Takes negative and makes positive. How beautiful. Faith is not mythical. Something mentally worked up. It's an absolutely fundamental result that happens in a person's heart. When faith is appropriated, there is something in the person's heart. But it can't be based on say well go touch a tree, you'll get well. Pray to the post. It's got to have a foundation. That foundation is the cornerstone. It's got to be based on Christ. Let's go to Romans 10:17. So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Now hold that thought. Faith cometh by hearing. In the Bible, hearing does not mean I heard you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the Bible, when they say I hear you, it means I understand you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, faith comes by understanding. And not just understanding. Understanding comes by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Faith comes by understanding. Understanding comes by the word of God. Which means you must have understanding that comes from God that Jesus is the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And faith comes by that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Hearing. So you don't need all the knowledge in the world. Do you see that? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You don't need knowledge. This is the fallacy. Knowledge doesn't give you understanding. Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, do you know how many people read the newspaper and don't get the right thing? Do you know how many people read the internet and get the wrong You can hear 20 different stories from the same article. It means people will read the same thing and not get the right understanding. Do you know how many This is the reason I still have a job. When I say that, I mean that as a pastor. The reason why there still has to be a five-fold ministry is because people read the Bible for 2,000 or 1,500 years, the English Bible, and still get it wrong. Which means the only thing is we by the Holy Ghost are tasked to bring understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can't rewrite the Bible. The Bible is there. There's the knowledge. &gt;&gt; We are tasked by the Holy Spirit to bring understanding. See it. The word of God gives us understanding only because of one thing, the Holy Spirit. He shall guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:17 to 18. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him, the eyes of your understanding, being enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of his calling and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints. the eyes of your understanding being enlightened. What does it mean? How does it happen? By the Holy Spirit. How he's going to give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation. Can you see that? That he may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him. He's not giving you the knowledge of him so you can get wisdom and revelation. Job 32:8, "But there is a spirit in man, and I love this, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding." So faith cometh by understanding, and understanding comes by the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; Understanding comes by the word of God. So people will say, "Oh, the word of God, the Bible, that's the written word." The word of God is a person. It's the logos. It's the revelation of all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 14:14-15. For I pray, for if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is it then? I will pray with the spirit and I WILL PRAY WITH THE UNDERSTANDING ALSO. I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also. You don't just pray. You don't just sing. You sing with understanding. You pray with understanding. &gt;&gt; Most Christians only want to sing in the spirit. Shout in the spirit. Pray in the spirit. Do you hear that? They think praying in the spirit means praying with tongues. Where's the understanding? Because if you have the understanding, then you'll be led of God to pray the right thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To know what it is you're singing. So understanding then is actually revelation, which is what? The rock from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith can only come into your soul if God grants you revelation. Saints, let me put it to you this way, and I and I keep saying this in our church back home in Durban. Um the only way you can really grasp this is like marriage. Marriage has to start with faith. Not even love because love is so far a concept you're coming into. Like when two when a young boy and a young girl meet each other, they don't know it. Do you agree? They don't know anything. In other words, zero knowledge. agreed. She looks attractive. He looks attractive. He's got a nice job. She's got a nice job. He's got a nice family. She's got a nice family. Those things you only going to know when you start talking to each other. You will never start talking to each other unless it begins with a little faith. It has to start with faith. You have to first trust. There must be like some small modicum of trust to come forward and to start speaking to each other first because if there's no trust is there's only doubt you'll say the guy's a creep. I don't want to talk to him. She just doesn't look right. I just don't want to talk to I want nothing to do with him. What? You don't even know them. Your friends are going to say GIVE IT A SHOT. YOU DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK. YOU DIDN'T EVEN take him on the first date. You didn't even take her on the first date. Second date, third date to get to know them. Try that. It doesn't work. You try first date, second date, third date, fourth date. By the time if you're still going to take dates to find out, you start ending up with more doubt. If you're a person who's been filled with doubt already, your faith is not going to give you the correct knowledge. And every kind of knowledge you're going to get thereafter. So this is why I often say to people for a marriage to work you have to never stop believing in each other. Love will become perfected because you believe in each other. There it is. You understand? Love will break down if you stop believing in each other. It always has to be faith understanding that then is actual revelation. Are you still with me saints? The only thing you can do to get it is as much of his word as possible when it comes now to God. So after you have had faith, now you go and he's going to give you the word based on that faith. And that knowledge is going to give you the correct knowledge which is going to increase your faith which is going to allow everything else to be built upon that bringing you to perfection. Amen. So if we can do this in the natural with natural things like the natural growth of a child uh so also is this possible in the spiritual except God has to give it to us first to start us off. There's no way you're going to do it yourself. Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God. No man could have revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven. Which means when you are seeing Christ, no man is going to convince you. Only God can do that. &gt;&gt; God is going to be the beginner. That's why the the first faith you receive is the gift of faith. &gt;&gt; You love him, saints. And and you know all the scriptures. No man can come to me except my father draws him. No man can call Jesus the Christ except by the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; All right, let's bring this to a close. Saints, doubt is sin. What I I I feel like a lot of people like I've got to stop here and tell you a lot of people don't know what sin is. People think sin is to you know like do something against God's word. A lot of us do things against God's word every day. &gt;&gt; Simply because we are humans who haven't gotten over ourselves yet and we're hard-headed, stubborn things, you know, and we're still trying to get our own way. That doesn't mean we hate God or we disbelieve him. That still just means we're struggling a little with ourselves and God understands that. That's not sin. When in the Bible it says fornication is a sin against your own body, &gt;&gt; what it means is you're damaging your own nature. &gt;&gt; You you're doing something to yourself. Of course, God can heal that, right? God can heal anything. &gt;&gt; But sin is something that corrupts the original nature. That's what sin is. &gt;&gt; Okay, hold this in in in mind. Let's go to all things are possible to him that believeth. Doubt is always of the devil. That's where the first sin come from. There is no other sin but doubt. Unbelief is the So in other words, he's he's saying doubt equals unbelief. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Unbelief is the original and only sin. Committing adultery is not a sin. Smoking cigarettes is not a sin. Getting drunk is not a sin. That's attributes of unbelief. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to draw you to. Doing all those things that then hurts your body. You're only doing that because there is doubt in your heart. Because there is unbelief in your heart. You got it? &gt;&gt; Those are attributes. Attributes means they they are actually things that are going to produce be produced because of something. &gt;&gt; You know any child born in this world is not an evil being is a just a real regular innocent perfect little soul. That soul is going to be hurt by humans from its parents to its siblings to its teachers to its university lectures. It's going to be constantly trampled on putting in doubt into this little soul and it turns from being an innocent being into somebody who is led down a path. Okay. So in the prayer lines, brother Madame would constantly pray that God would remove the doubt from the hearts of the people. He said in other places that doubt is sin, drinking smoke in many other places. They're not sin. Doubt is the actual sin. All these things were attributes of doubt and sin. It is because of doubt that we go out and do all these other things. without doubt we would be doing things of God and living righteously. Let's go to Matthew 21:21-22. Just one scripture and one quote and we close. Faith can accomplish great things. H let's see it. Jesus answered and said unto them, "Verily I say unto you, if you have faith and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea," it shall be done. And all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing, he shall receive. You shall receive. So this is the thing. People want to be people that move mountains. What mountains? Hey, like I I want to leave the dragonsburg where it is. There's no reason to go move that. It looks beautiful right there. There's no reason to move actual. So what are the mountains he's talking about? It's the strongholds of things caused by unbelief and doubt. &gt;&gt; Right? You see the mountain as your problem. You you see the smoking, the drinking, the fornication, the pornography. You see that as the mountain? That's not even the mountain. That's been stuff built on a foundation of doubt. What is causing you to doubt? What is causing you to devalue yourself? Right? Faith can accomplish great things if there's light in your soul. You wouldn't desire that. If there's light in your soul, if you're living by a life of faith, you'll be more relaxed. You'll believe in people. You'll believe in God. You believe tomorrow is secure. God knows all things. You'll wake up with a smile. You'll trust him in all things. Faith can accomplish great things. the greatest battle ever fought. The last quote as we close, you can have little consciences and little feelings and little sensations and all these things that has nothing to do with it. That's just little sensations and things. And when it comes to reality, your mind opens it up. Your mind either accepts it or rejects it. That's it, friends. God let none of them miss it. It's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door. listens to your conscience, listens to your memory, listens to your affections. But when your mind closes itself to these things and let God, the spirit of his word, come in, it blows the rest of the stuff out. Every doubt is gone. Every fear is gone. Every sensation of doubt is gone. Every feeling is gone. There's nothing standing there but the word of God. And Satan cannot battle against that. No, sir. He cannot battle against it. Now, we know that's the truth. So this is our biggest fight here on earth. In the stature of a perfect man, faith is the first step. It is the foundation. It's quite clear. He had to take away doubt before attempting to put the other virtues in us. &gt;&gt; Faith is the strength. It's uh it's the one of the seven virtues we need to overcome doubt in our souls. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in closing, I want to explain that to you. When you live as a person with more doubt than faith, that's when you become anxious of everything. Untrusting, where you believe even when people telling you the truth, you don't trust them. You believe they're lying. Uh living like that is stressful. It causes depression. It puts problems in marriages. It put problem between father and child. It put problems between teachers and and students. It puts problems between the heads of countries and the people because people are living with darkness in their souls. If you lived with people who have faith, if people have faith and people live by faith, you will be more positive. You'll want to testify of your faith. And when you testify and you tell people of Jesus Christ, they will see that there is a conviction inside. If you preach the word, they'll know you know what you're talking about. They know you believe what you're talking about because they can sense there is light from within. There's something else coming. But when you yourself have doubt, they'll sense it. What I'm saying to you is if you have doubt in your soul, it leads down a certain path. If you have faith, it leads down a different path. Literally everything about your life will be different if you have faith. I mean even your home will be decorated differently. H even your dogs will be happier. Do you know that a dog is a pack animal? You have dogs. They'll they'll literally tell you dogs take on the the nature of the owner. You understand? So, if you got stupid dogs, you know what it means, right? I'm just kidding. You've got to understand that faith and doubt produces different parts of life. It's the foundation for all things. And you will build every aspect of your life. If you have children and if you live with doubt, you will raise your children on doubt. That'll produce a certain path for them. If you raise your children on faith, it will produce a certain path for them. It all starts there. Faith is the perfect foundation and the only destroyer of doubt. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let us bow our heads together.
