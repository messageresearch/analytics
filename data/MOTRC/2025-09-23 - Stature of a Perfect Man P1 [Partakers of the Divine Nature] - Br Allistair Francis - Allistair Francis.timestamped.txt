[0:04] Amen. We like to greet you in the
[0:06] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[0:07] Jesus Christ. And uh before you take
[0:10] your seats, um let's just read one
[0:14] scripture and then we pray. Ephesians
[0:17] chapter 4:13
[0:18] [Music]
[0:21] says,
[0:23] "Till we all come in the unity of the
[0:26] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[0:29] God unto a perfect man unto the measure
[0:33] of the stature of the fullness of
[0:35] Christ." Amen. May the Lord add a
[0:38] blessing to his word. Let's bow our
[0:40] heads as we pray.
[0:44] Amen.
[0:46] Dear Lord Jesus, what a wonderful
[0:48] privilege it is, Lord, that we can bow
[0:51] in your presence this morning. We
[0:53] certainly appreciate you, oh Lord, and
[0:56] thank you for this wonderful time that
[0:58] we could spend together with the saints
[1:00] of God and of light, precious faith. We
[1:03] appreciate Lord all your goodness and
[1:05] your grace toward us for safe traveling
[1:08] with the healing of our bodies for the
[1:11] wisdom that you give to us every single
[1:12] day Lord that we might live our lives
[1:15] guided and our paths lit by the Holy
[1:18] Spirit. We appreciate you Lord. Thank
[1:20] you Lord for this gathering of
[1:22] believers. We know it is just once a
[1:25] month that we get together here and yet
[1:28] Lord we appreciate the faithfulness of
[1:30] the saints and we ask you Lord that you
[1:32] would take the sacrifice of worship and
[1:35] praise that we have brought this morning
[1:37] by our lips by our hearts by our minds
[1:39] and our souls. May it be accepted before
[1:43] you as a sweet smelling savor. Lord, may
[1:46] the prayers of the saints, Father, for
[1:48] all those needs that were mentioned,
[1:51] Lord Jesus, we may ascend to you and
[1:54] undertake for our needs. We pray, Father
[1:56] God, we commit the service before you
[1:59] this morning. And we appreciate once
[2:01] again the revealed word of the hour.
[2:03] Appreciate the message of the prophet of
[2:05] the last day. We thank you Lord from the
[2:08] bottom of our hearts for this great
[2:09] salvation that you have brought to us by
[2:13] such a great ministry in the in these
[2:15] last times. Lord Jesus we appreciate it
[2:18] with more than our life. Oh God we pray
[2:21] that you may bless us this morning as we
[2:22] would break into the very things that he
[2:25] has taught and we appreciate Lord that
[2:27] we can have this time once again. May
[2:29] you be with us. Bless the reading of the
[2:31] word as well and may you bless our
[2:33] hearts. Father, we pray and ask all of
[2:34] these things in your precious name with
[2:36] praise and thanksgiving. Amen. The Lord
[2:40] bless you. May be seated. We'd like to
[2:42] greet you once again in the precious
[2:44] name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Certainly
[2:46] good to be with you once again in
[2:48] Newcastle. And um uh trusting that the
[2:51] Lord will bless us this morning as we
[2:54] begin a new series. And uh the last time
[2:57] we we told you we're going to uh close
[3:00] down the series on on living the life
[3:03] and we're going to probably be pick up a
[3:05] lot of the things on gathering the
[3:06] stones in maybe a different uh format.
[3:10] But so we are going to begin as I said
[3:13] to you on the WhatsApp group the stature
[3:17] of a perfect man. And this is going to
[3:18] be part one. It's the introduction and
[3:22] for a title, partakers of the divine
[3:25] nature. Amen. So once again, Ephesians
[3:29] 4:13 says, "Till we all come in the
[3:32] unity of the faith." That's that's like
[3:34] a like a a um a point that we are
[3:38] looking to till we all come in the unity
[3:41] of the faith. That means we're expecting
[3:43] to all come to the unity of the faith.
[3:45] Amen. and of the knowledge of the son of
[3:48] God unto a perfect man and the measure
[3:51] of the stature of the fullness of
[3:53] Christ. Amen. So stature of a perfect
[3:57] man was a message that the prophet
[4:00] preached on October 14th, 1962 at
[4:03] Jeffersonville. Then on November 4th,
[4:06] 1962, just under a month later, he
[4:09] preaches the same message under a
[4:12] different title called Blasphemous
[4:14] Names. So basically statue of a perfect
[4:16] man and blasphemous names are the same
[4:18] message with the same uh uh thought in
[4:22] there but in blasphemous names he takes
[4:25] the inspiration from the dream of a lady
[4:28] in the church named sister shepherd and
[4:30] that the relationship of these two
[4:32] messages is fascinating because as you
[4:35] know that Christianity
[4:38] uh uh is a religion eventually created
[4:42] by man. Christ didn't create
[4:44] Christianity. Christ didn't even call us
[4:46] Christians. Uh the world creates
[4:49] religions. God brings faith. And uh
[4:52] Christ reached out to all people. He did
[4:54] not create a denomination. He didn't
[4:56] create a sect. He didn't teach uh that
[4:59] there should be all this. He didn't
[5:01] teach that we should amass wealth to
[5:04] ourselves, that we should become any
[5:06] religion eventually ends up there. And
[5:09] the whole point of the truth is is to
[5:11] take us away from that and uh to bring
[5:14] us back to humility to be able to serve
[5:17] people to be able to tell people the
[5:19] truth and that's what this is about. So
[5:22] when you hear something like stature of
[5:23] a perfect man and then you hear this
[5:25] message called blasphemous names and
[5:27] it's the same message under different
[5:29] titles there's something there that we
[5:32] will eventually get to that's very very
[5:34] important but I think and I think it's
[5:36] really fascinating but we'll keep it for
[5:37] the end of the series. Amen.
[5:40] So in this message, Statue of a Perfect
[5:42] Man, he was inspired by 2 Peter 1:3-10,
[5:47] which we will read later, and Ephesians
[5:49] 4:13, which we have just read. And this
[5:52] is our reason for calling our series
[5:54] stature of a perfect man. Okay? And it
[5:57] comes from the word the the whole the
[6:00] clue of everything comes from the word
[6:02] stature. Okay? Now stature refers to the
[6:06] height
[6:08] or the measurements of a person, right?
[6:11] The stature of of a man is the
[6:14] measurement the measurements of a
[6:16] person. The stature of of anything is
[6:19] the measurements of of it, right? So u
[6:23] in other words when he says the stature
[6:25] of a perfect man and he's saying till we
[6:27] all come to the fullness it is the
[6:30] height or the measurement of a perfect
[6:34] man
[6:35] &gt;&gt; right and we are referring to the
[6:37] spiritual stature the highest height
[6:41] there is or there can be and there is
[6:44] none and never has been a man more
[6:47] perfect than Christ. He is the perfect
[6:50] man. That's what our faith is. Now,
[6:52] Ephesians 4:13 is telling us. Now, how
[6:55] do we know this? Because you remember
[6:56] Revelations 5 when it said, "Who is
[6:58] worthy to take the book?" And there was
[7:01] none worthy, not on earth, not in
[7:03] heaven, not under the earth. In other
[7:04] words, in any spiritual dimension, there
[7:07] was not one worthy to take the book.
[7:09] Right? So, Ephesians 4:13 is telling us
[7:13] that we must be measured against his
[7:16] full stature. Right? What that means is
[7:19] for example if he's the standard we must
[7:22] be measured against that standard
[7:24] &gt;&gt; right so we must be measured according
[7:26] to him you can measure yourself to any
[7:29] other person and you might never attain
[7:32] it you might measure yourself to Mr.
[7:34] Mandela and nobody will attain that. You
[7:37] might measure yourself to Mahatma Gandhi
[7:41] and nobody will ever there's nobody who
[7:43] will be exactly like Mahatma Gandhi.
[7:45] There'll been there'll never be someone
[7:47] exactly like Nelson Mandela or any of
[7:49] the heroes of history. Never. But
[7:53] there's actually something concerning
[7:55] Christ that tells you you can attain it.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; Just think about that. There'll always
[8:01] be there'll be people who say that guy
[8:04] you know he's so close he's almost like
[8:06] Mr. Mandela he's almost like Mahatma
[8:10] Gandhi one of the heroes of of the world
[8:13] but only Christ is one who tells you you
[8:16] can attain the perfection
[8:18] &gt;&gt; the completeness
[8:20] it's wonderful isn't it so in the Bible
[8:23] so here's the other thing very very
[8:25] important for us to understand in the
[8:28] Bible there is this word perfect
[8:32] right and in human nature the word
[8:36] Perfect means to be like blameless or
[8:40] spotless or having no mistakes or so.
[8:43] When we think about it, we think who
[8:45] could ever be perfect? Nobody's perfect.
[8:47] That's a common thing we say nowadays,
[8:49] right? Nobody's perfect. And it's like
[8:51] an excuse, you know, like I made a
[8:53] mistake. I did something wrong. Nobody's
[8:55] perfect. That's not what the Bible means
[8:58] by perfect. In the Bible, the word
[9:00] perfect means complete.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Okay? To be perfected means to be
[9:06] complete.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; And complete in the Bible is a
[9:10] completely different understanding.
[9:14] Complete does not mean finished or
[9:17] completed. Complete means satisfied or
[9:22] needing nothing more or having all that
[9:26] is necessary.
[9:28] Completely different. So, you know, um
[9:32] let's say um a man gets married to the
[9:36] the love of his life and he says, "I am
[9:38] complete." That doesn't mean he's
[9:40] perfect. That doesn't mean he's got no
[9:43] mistakes. That doesn't mean uh I mean,
[9:46] he's he's married a woman and he says,
[9:48] "I'm complete. He still needs a house.
[9:50] He still needs a car. He still needs a
[9:52] whole lot of other things." What does he
[9:54] mean by saying I'm complete? He means I
[9:58] have everything I need, everything that
[10:01] is necessary and with that I can gain
[10:03] anything else.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So to the measure or
[10:08] the stature of a perfect man can be can
[10:11] be said the stature of a complete man.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; The stature the measure of a person who
[10:19] needs nothing else who has everything
[10:21] that is necessary.
[10:23] So which brings us to the question
[10:27] necessary for what?
[10:30] Right? So you'll never find in anyone's
[10:35] eyes a perfect person for anything.
[10:40] Never. And and this is the condition
[10:43] with humans is we judge everyone. Uh it
[10:47] doesn't matter what religion you come
[10:48] from, whether you're a Christian,
[10:49] whether you're filled with the Holy
[10:51] Ghost, you still judge everyone.
[10:53] And you're always finding people wanting
[10:57] like they're always lacking something.
[10:58] They're missing something like they're
[11:00] never uh they're never fully perfect in
[11:03] anybody's eyes. Right? So obviously if
[11:08] we need to be measured against the
[11:10] stature of a perfect man, a complete
[11:12] man, and that is Christ, then our aim as
[11:16] Christians, you know, we were not we're
[11:19] not here for a religion. We're not here
[11:23] for a religious purpose. One of the
[11:25] reasons why we as this church are so few
[11:29] in number is because we tell the truth.
[11:32] You can get a whole lot more people if
[11:34] you keep telling lies for 50 years.
[11:37] Because people love living in lies. The
[11:39] moment you tell people the truth, they
[11:41] leave because the truth cuts them up.
[11:44] The truth corrects them. The truth
[11:46] judges. The truth exposes us, our
[11:48] feelings, our intentions. The truth
[11:51] demands light. Light means uh honesty
[11:54] and exposure.
[11:56] Living honestly in the eyes of all
[11:59] people. The truth sets you free.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Uh lies makes you stressed, right? And
[12:07] most religion is based on lies.
[12:11] They took Christianity, the original
[12:13] words of Christ, and created lies and
[12:16] formed denominations and formed sects
[12:20] and followings to elevate a certain
[12:23] person or a certain movement. But if you
[12:27] come back to the truth, you'll never get
[12:29] that.
[12:31] This is why maj the Bible will tell you
[12:33] there are so few in the end times that
[12:36] will actually be following the truth and
[12:38] walking in the light. Are you with me?
[12:40] So our aim as Christians is not to come
[12:45] to a part of the measure. If you really
[12:50] want to be like him as we've sung make
[12:53] make me more like thee. That means I
[12:56] want to come to the full stature. I'm
[12:58] not going to be satisfied. I want I
[13:00] don't want a fraction. I want the whole.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; I want to come to the fullness of the
[13:05] stature of a perfect man. Amen. So to be
[13:08] able to come to that fullness, we have
[13:10] to study what makes up the stature of
[13:13] Christ, the perfect man. Now when we
[13:16] think of Christ, we think, you know, he
[13:19] was God. Uh who can measure up to God?
[13:24] All right, here's the secret. It's not
[13:27] the God part that we must fulfill.
[13:31] &gt;&gt; It's the man part,
[13:34] &gt;&gt; right? God's purpose for us was always
[13:37] to be a perfect man, not a perfect God,
[13:40] &gt;&gt; a perfect man.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Right? So what happened was sin robbed
[13:46] us of that ability.
[13:48] Christ came to bring back what would be
[13:50] the purpose of God becoming man.
[13:54] Not to show you what God is, but to show
[13:56] you what man is.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; What a complete godly man is. That was
[14:03] the whole purpose of him coming. And why
[14:06] would he have to show us that? Because
[14:08] we sinned against that.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; What makes this study easier is the
[14:16] understanding of the church ages and you
[14:19] know what we use in this the sort of
[14:21] pyramid diagram. Amen. So Christ came to
[14:24] bring back that ability to change the
[14:27] world. All right. This is why you have
[14:30] scriptures like for God so loved the
[14:31] world that he gave his only son that
[14:33] whosoever might believe. Right? There
[14:36] should be salvation for that person,
[14:38] &gt;&gt; right? Salvation means what? Healing.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Healing from what? From the sin, the the
[14:47] fall from the original condition of man.
[14:50] To think that we and it's you don't need
[14:53] scientific proof. You don't need
[14:55] empirical evidence. You are born as a
[14:57] baby a perfect soul, a perfect human, a
[15:01] human capable of every single good
[15:03] thing. But from the time your your
[15:06] parents teach you to speak, your
[15:08] teachers in school, your friends, you
[15:10] just start doing everything bad. Nobody
[15:12] just
[15:14] nobody well anymore since the fall of
[15:17] Adam, nobody thinks I have to do the
[15:19] right thing. Everyone thinks I can do
[15:23] the wrong thing and find an excuse for
[15:25] the wrong thing.
[15:30] And so this is why this is different in
[15:33] terms of Christianity, in terms of
[15:35] Christ. I don't really like to use the
[15:38] word Christianity because it's such a
[15:40] label today that is that is uh abused by
[15:44] people who claim to be Christians and
[15:46] are not true Christians. Right? So let's
[15:49] go to this diagram
[15:51] very quickly and uh I hope you can see
[15:53] that. There we go. So this is just a a
[15:59] diagram a symbol, right? It's it's it's
[16:02] not uh any real or particular uh thing.
[16:06] It's just we couldn't explain this with
[16:09] a circle or a or a rectangle or a
[16:11] square. This is the best thing to do
[16:13] because there is a capping stone that
[16:15] fits on it. Right? So what we're looking
[16:18] at is there at the bottom from faith
[16:21] from the bottom right at the at the base
[16:24] that would be the starting point of what
[16:26] is called Christianity today which is
[16:28] when Christ died. And so that first
[16:32] church age called Ephesus fell under the
[16:35] ministry and the influence of Paul the
[16:38] apostle to the Gentiles. Now you can see
[16:41] at the bottom the base is so broad. They
[16:44] were baptizing 3,000 people in one day,
[16:48] &gt;&gt; right? First day they bapt I once told
[16:51] our people, can you imagine how tired
[16:53] you would be baptizing 3,000 people?
[16:57] By the time you get to a 100, one man is
[16:59] tired. How do they get in 3,000 people
[17:02] in one? And they had no cars, no social
[17:05] media. It means people flocked
[17:09] to the river or the marketplaces
[17:11] wherever they were and they baptized
[17:13] 3,000.
[17:14] So you had all these people accepting
[17:17] and the reasons I could go into it but
[17:19] I'll take I'll take hours to explain to
[17:21] you why people were attracted to
[17:24] Christianity
[17:26] in the Middle East moving towards the
[17:28] west and the east. Why? Because every
[17:32] other regime at that time was
[17:34] oppressive, restrictive and they were
[17:38] manipulating people with fear of death,
[17:40] fear of the underworld and fear of
[17:42] darkness. And they were using
[17:44] sacrifices, sacrifices of babies and
[17:47] young virgins. This was what the Middle
[17:49] East and the religions around was all
[17:51] about. And Christianity by the sacrifice
[17:55] of Christ liberated them from that and
[17:58] said there is no longer need for the
[18:00] spilling of any other blood cuz his
[18:02] blood will do.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; That's why it liberated that whole
[18:06] region and why so many people why do you
[18:08] think you would actually baptize 3,000
[18:10] people on the first day?
[18:13] Because of the promise,
[18:16] &gt;&gt; right? So now you have all these people
[18:19] uh at this base. And so what we're
[18:21] seeing is it it progresses under the
[18:24] ministries and it starts the the the
[18:26] ministry of Christ begins to move
[18:28] through men of different nations and
[18:30] starts to move west. So we we go to
[18:33] Ireanius of Leons from France Martin
[18:36] Cola Luther Germany Wesley of the United
[18:39] Kingdom and eventually the United
[18:41] States. So that's the if you track
[18:42] Christianity from Jerusalem, it tracks
[18:46] all the way to the the United States
[18:48] where the last foundation was or if I
[18:51] say the last progression of the church
[18:54] from America, everything goes downhill
[18:58] because they literally took
[18:59] Christianity, publicized it, monetized
[19:02] it, messed it up with Hollywood, changed
[19:05] all the holiness and they've desecrated
[19:07] it. So there's no growth from there.
[19:10] Understand? So that's that's what it's
[19:12] that's what it's tracking. So when you
[19:14] reach that point there, we now are
[19:17] awaiting the capstone which is Christ
[19:19] himself. So now if you look that is the
[19:21] the top piece there. And so if you look
[19:25] at what is in the center there, you've
[19:26] got those virtues, faith, virtue,
[19:28] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[19:30] godliness, and brotherly kindness. What
[19:32] it's showing us is characteristics
[19:35] that the entire growth or maturity of
[19:39] the church was putting back into man
[19:43] such that when it reaches its fullness
[19:46] then Christ can come down and complete
[19:49] the man.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Right? So that's the whole study of the
[19:54] stature of a perfect man. So I got six
[19:58] points that I put up. If you study these
[20:01] church ages, number one, it reveals
[20:04] every doctrine the church should follow.
[20:06] Number two, it reveals every character
[20:10] that prevails in the world. So if you
[20:13] look at this, the the study of the
[20:14] church ages, it reveals all the
[20:16] characters in the world, false and true.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; It tells you what the false church did.
[20:21] It tells you what the true church did.
[20:22] It show you how the false church
[20:24] persecuted the true church. A lot of
[20:26] Christians don't like to mention this,
[20:27] but the Catholic Church killed 68
[20:30] million Christians during the dark ages.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; This was Christians slaughtering
[20:34] Christians. What for? Because they
[20:35] disagreed on doctrine and the Holy
[20:38] Ghost. And the Christian churches
[20:40] started calling each other the the most
[20:42] powerful ones started calling the others
[20:44] heretics. So what it's doing is exposing
[20:47] the nature of man. God allowed that. So
[20:51] you could see the nature of man. And
[20:53] those who when the false nature was
[20:55] exposed, the true nature was now shown.
[20:58] This is what it is in opposition to
[21:01] that. So the true believer would tend
[21:04] not to be like that which was exposed as
[21:06] false. That's the whole point. So it
[21:09] reveals every character that prevails in
[21:11] the world. Number three, it reveals the
[21:13] character the true Christian and the
[21:14] false the true and false vine like I
[21:16] just elaborated. Number four, it reveals
[21:20] the deity of Christ. So Christ was not
[21:22] just a man. He was God the man.
[21:27] &gt;&gt; And from the beginning when God created
[21:29] Adam, he created Adam,
[21:32] &gt;&gt; God the man,
[21:33] &gt;&gt; which is what all humans according to
[21:36] the Bible was were meant to be. You were
[21:39] meant to be the dominion over the earth.
[21:41] You were meant to be the ones who would
[21:44] protect the ecological system, protect
[21:46] the earth, protect nature, make sure the
[21:49] every ecological system runs according
[21:51] to the order of God. You were supposed
[21:53] to be in sub uh you were supposed to
[21:56] have everything under your dominion. You
[21:58] were supposed to have everything under
[21:59] your subjection. You were not supposed
[22:02] to be terrified of a cockroach and a
[22:03] mouse. And you were not supposed to be
[22:05] afraid of a lion and an elephant. They
[22:08] were supposed to be afraid of you. They
[22:10] were supposed to serve you. You were
[22:12] made in the image of God.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; And look how far we've fallen. We're
[22:17] afraid of our own shadows today.
[22:20] Right? That doesn't sound like a God
[22:22] man, right?
[22:24] Look at us. We're we're in subjection to
[22:27] alcohol, to drugs, to smoking, to
[22:31] swearing,
[22:33] to uh pornography, to to fornication. We
[22:38] who are supposedly made in the image of
[22:41] God are in subjection to vices
[22:46] and then we create religions to make us
[22:48] feel okay with our vices.
[22:52] This is the the word of God that tells
[22:55] you you're meant to be above all that.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; Christ came to show us and put all
[23:01] things under his feet. means in
[23:04] subjection to him.
[23:05] &gt;&gt; Which means you by the spirit of God, by
[23:08] your own free will are supposed to be
[23:11] able to putting are supposed to be able
[23:13] to put all sin under your feet.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Right? So how can you do that unless you
[23:20] have what is necessary?
[23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you have all that is necessary?
[23:28] So number five, he says shows us Christ
[23:31] in the church. That means like we spoke
[23:33] of last week, Christ means the word made
[23:36] flesh. The word made flesh in the
[23:38] church. That's the teaching on church
[23:40] age is what it shows us. And then it
[23:42] shows us the progress of the church to
[23:44] the rapture. And what is the rapture?
[23:46] That capstone coming down is the
[23:48] rapture. It is Christ and the bride
[23:50] becoming one. It is finally man and God
[23:53] uniting, bringing back what was lost.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; That's where we are today. Right? So
[24:00] what each age actually showed was how
[24:03] the Holy Spirit was taking the Gentiles
[24:06] through stages of maturity to be
[24:09] prepared for the second coming of
[24:11] Christ, the rapture. Are you with us? So
[24:14] since the time of Christ, the character,
[24:16] the nature of Christians has been
[24:18] changing and developing into something
[24:21] totally different than what it started
[24:23] with. So we must be logical. The world
[24:27] is changing. The world has been changing
[24:30] in the last 2,000 years. The world was
[24:32] changing from after Christ. From after
[24:36] Christ to Christianity, it became
[24:38] political under Constantine of Rome. And
[24:42] he politicized Christianity. He joined
[24:44] church and state to make Christianity a
[24:47] political religion. That was not Christ
[24:49] teaching.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Right? And then thereafter because they
[24:53] created this massive church uh universal
[24:56] church now every other church that is
[24:58] formed believes it's got to have a
[25:00] structure like that one. And that's the
[25:01] mistake.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; Once you have a hierarchy of men
[25:05] controlling the word of God it's already
[25:08] poisoned.
[25:10] &gt;&gt; Right? So because times are changing
[25:14] Christians do not look like the original
[25:17] Christians
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Christians today. So though when we look
[25:22] at that and we look at that broad base
[25:24] of that pyramid and it's moving upward,
[25:27] what are you seeing? You're seeing how
[25:29] it started with this massive amount and
[25:31] now it's dwindling out. And yet today
[25:34] you've got the most number of Christians
[25:37] in history.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:41] &gt;&gt; People affiliated to Christianity. Let's
[25:43] put it that way. Like on the on the
[25:45] African continent, we probably have the
[25:48] most number of Christians in the world.
[25:50] It's incredible, right? The whole
[25:53] African continent used to be uh filled
[25:55] with ancestral worship and what would we
[25:58] would call paganism. But today we have
[26:01] the most and the most number of message
[26:03] believers are Africans,
[26:06] &gt;&gt; right? There's so many in India. They're
[26:09] in China. They're in the the communist
[26:11] countries. They're they're everywhere.
[26:13] So, we've got this millions and millions
[26:15] of of Christian people and they're
[26:17] affiliated to Christianity, but
[26:19] according to the teaching, there are
[26:21] actually very few because it comes down
[26:25] to a narrow at the top. That means
[26:27] there's a whole bunch of people, but
[26:28] they don't actually fall into what real
[26:31] Christianity is.
[26:35] And that's right. You'll find it happens
[26:37] with every single church. Every
[26:39] individual church starts off will start
[26:41] off with a lot of people and eventually
[26:42] it starts narrowing down because the
[26:45] stronger the truth becomes the more
[26:48] people will leave or they'll form their
[26:50] own kind of Christianity. Are you with
[26:53] me? So though we seem to be progressing
[26:57] towards maturity and towards completion,
[27:02] it also seems that spiritually we're
[27:04] we're getting there. But naturally, we
[27:07] are digressing as humans. We're
[27:10] literally living a shorter lifespan.
[27:14] We're literally living
[27:16] more immoral,
[27:18] more unrighteous
[27:20] than the times where people had less.
[27:25] Right? This is a dangerous confession
[27:28] that we make when we say we are the
[27:30] bride of Christ and we are in the bride
[27:32] age and we are in the last days. It's a
[27:35] dangerous confession. Why is it
[27:36] dangerous? Because basically, if you're
[27:38] saying we're in the bride age, we are
[27:39] saying we're in the bride age. We're out
[27:41] of the seven church ages. What we're
[27:43] saying is we have reached we have
[27:45] received everything in its completeness.
[27:48] In other words, we have everything that
[27:49] is necessary to fulfill the prophecies.
[27:54] So what it actually means is we have all
[27:56] the potentials that it takes today to
[28:00] produce perfect man. We just have to
[28:03] understand what perfect man really is.
[28:06] Amen. So how can we be so sure? Right?
[28:10] The fullness of the word has come. Do
[28:13] you believe that?
[28:14] &gt;&gt; We have the open book.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Uh and u everything has been taught to
[28:19] us.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; We are at the end of all things. We have
[28:22] all the teaching required. Amen.
[28:25] &gt;&gt; We have the original sin,
[28:27] &gt;&gt; the true Godhead, the true baptism,
[28:30] predestination, adoption, the de the
[28:33] deity of Christ, the mystery of Christ
[28:36] revealed, the revelation of the seals,
[28:37] the revelation of the church ages,
[28:39] revelation of trumpets, the opened book
[28:41] of revelation. We have everything. There
[28:44] is nothing any man still has to come to
[28:47] teach us of the Bible. We literally have
[28:50] in terms of the word every single
[28:53] teaching required to attain what Christ
[28:56] has sent for us to do. There's nothing
[28:59] left.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; There's no future prophet prophesied of
[29:04] &gt;&gt; for us, the gentile church. It's done.
[29:07] &gt;&gt; From here on, it's only downhill.
[29:12] From according to the book of
[29:13] Revelations, from here on the Christian
[29:14] church will go into apostasy.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; They will go into lies. They will go
[29:19] into immorality. They will go into great
[29:20] tribulation. And they will lose their
[29:23] lives in a great tribulation. They will
[29:25] eventually join a one world system which
[29:27] is of an antichrist system against
[29:29] Christianity itself. That's what the
[29:31] book of revelation tells us will happen.
[29:33] And Christ will redeem those that remain
[29:36] truthful to the word.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; There is nothing left for anyone to
[29:40] teach us. It is done.
[29:44] So we just need if we have all the
[29:48] teaching that is necessary what we need
[29:50] for each individual is to receive the
[29:52] revelation of it all.
[29:55] &gt;&gt; Everyone needs to come to their
[29:57] individual
[29:59] full potential. That's all we're waiting
[30:02] for. Now it is firstly important to
[30:05] understand that the church spiritually
[30:08] has been built up to a stage where it
[30:10] can produce maturity.
[30:13] That's what we want to see. We want to
[30:15] see maturity in people. Are you with me?
[30:19] Amen. So, what is then the church?
[30:23] The church is like the womb of a woman
[30:26] that brings forth a child. What it's
[30:28] doing is it's birthing believers,
[30:32] birthing individuals that can become the
[30:34] stature of a of a perfect man. So, each
[30:38] one of us, we are the child that the
[30:40] church brings forth. Unfortunately,
[30:42] today you're not going to be walking
[30:44] around in the world and suddenly just
[30:46] have an epiphany and and just say, "Wow,
[30:48] you never heard of him before and you
[30:50] just suddenly say, "Wow, Christ, he is
[30:53] God. I need to follow him. I need to
[30:56] read the Bible." You know, you don't get
[30:57] that. It has to take the church to
[31:00] attract you to him,
[31:02] &gt;&gt; a believer to testify to you so that you
[31:05] can hear him. It will definitely take
[31:09] something from the church to bring you
[31:10] in. There's no other way. Right? So the
[31:13] church will bring your conception, your
[31:16] birth and help you move towards
[31:19] maturity. Are you with me? So in Paul's
[31:22] day, the church was the spiritual womb
[31:24] that produced Christians according to
[31:26] the word for their day, according to the
[31:28] maturity level of that time. In
[31:31] Ireneius's in Smyrna, in Pergamus, in
[31:34] all the ages, as you're going up on that
[31:36] pyramid diagram, each ministry
[31:40] produced Christians based on the word
[31:42] for their day,
[31:44] &gt;&gt; because that was the seed. The church at
[31:47] that time was the womb for the seed of
[31:49] that day,
[31:51] &gt;&gt; right? So, since then, the church has
[31:54] gone through growing development stages.
[31:57] And like I said, we could have a casual
[31:59] conversation. And it will take hours to
[32:01] explain to you church history. How did
[32:03] we eventually end up here like this in
[32:06] this format when it started off sitting
[32:09] on floors in dungy halls and catacombs
[32:12] under the Roman governments and and uh
[32:15] regimes? How did we end up here?
[32:20] Freedom of religion, freedom of speech,
[32:22] having our own cathedrals and temples
[32:24] and and and churches and air
[32:26] conditioning and wall-to-wall carpeting
[32:28] and and uh freedom to say anything we
[32:31] want to. How did we end up here when in
[32:34] the first church, Ananas and Safh lied
[32:37] before Peter and and were were struck
[32:40] dead because they lied to the Holy
[32:42] Spirit. Now you can have Christians
[32:44] lying from behind the pulpits and
[32:46] nothing happens. How did we end up here?
[32:49] There's been a growth
[32:51] &gt;&gt; right to maturity. So the developmental
[32:55] stages that have taken the church
[32:57] through it's taken us through many
[32:59] important battles, trials, victories
[33:02] from which we have learned and studied
[33:04] to become truly spiritual. Right? We are
[33:07] all sinners called to this perfection.
[33:11] Amen. Most of us spent the majority of
[33:14] our lives in sin.
[33:17] Like I just explained from the time
[33:19] you're born and then you start speaking
[33:20] lies and then you start learning from
[33:22] your friends and then you know you only
[33:24] really become conscious of God and
[33:26] decide to turn your life around at a at
[33:28] a more mature stage in life. Right? So
[33:33] no other age could have
[33:36] been what we are today
[33:40] because we had to have grown through all
[33:42] the stages, learned all the mistakes,
[33:46] been through all the troubles and
[33:48] trials, learned what it was to be a
[33:50] political movement, a lying movement, a
[33:55] manipulating movement for us to know we
[33:58] should not be that. We had to go through
[34:01] a lot of things, right? So in this
[34:04] present day, the true church is able to
[34:07] take us in and by the word of God for
[34:09] this day produce complete people
[34:14] &gt;&gt; and make you ready for the rapture.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; No other age could have done this. The
[34:19] church was never ready in any of the
[34:22] other ages to do this because they
[34:24] lacked the full maturity.
[34:27] Let's go to the invisible union of the
[34:29] bride of Christ. This a message preached
[34:31] 1965 25th November says like my body was
[34:35] built I'm told it started in the spine.
[34:38] So like a baby is being born it's being
[34:40] conceived in the mom's womb and uh it's
[34:43] now uh growing starts from the spine but
[34:46] it wasn't all spine. It went from that
[34:48] to ribs to lungs to hands to arms and
[34:51] feet and so forth. And you come out on
[34:52] out to be the person that I am. And so
[34:56] was God manifested in the beginning. And
[34:58] finally, he was appeared as Jehovah, God
[35:02] the Father. Then he appeared as God the
[35:04] Son in Jesus Christ. Now he's appeared
[35:06] as God the Holy Ghost. The same God all
[35:09] the time. Three manifestations of the
[35:11] same God. Now we find in this that each
[35:14] generation God has loted his word from
[35:17] the beginning. You see it each
[35:20] generation there's a revelation of the
[35:22] word a loted to that generation.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; So you couldn't give the revelation of
[35:28] the seven seals in Paul's day.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; You couldn't give the revelation of the
[35:32] thunders in Paul's day. You could you
[35:34] couldn't talk about the seven trumpets
[35:36] because none of that had even happened
[35:38] yet in Paul's day.
[35:41] So just like evolution came I'm reading
[35:45] just like first thing God created let's
[35:48] say he created boty life first then he
[35:50] created animal life then he created
[35:51] human life next kind of an evolution
[35:54] kind of an evolution rising higher
[35:56] notice when people see that and think oh
[35:58] what do you mean evolution you mean he's
[36:00] saying we started from monkeys no we
[36:02] believe there's an evolution right an
[36:05] evolving of life but so he's showing how
[36:09] there was bot life, animal life, human
[36:11] life, kind of an evolution rising
[36:13] higher. So, paragraph 70, here's what I
[36:16] want to get to. So, has it been in God
[36:20] and his church. So, use all that to tell
[36:22] us there's been an evolving
[36:25] of the church. There's been an evolving
[36:27] of man through the purpose of the
[36:30] church. So, what was the purpose of the
[36:32] church? Ages to bring the evolving of
[36:35] man from sinful man to complete man.
[36:41] So,
[36:42] you know, I when you think it's so easy
[36:45] to uh to label everybody as bad people,
[36:49] and we don't do that.
[36:52] Uh to me, sin is actually refined to
[36:58] being incomplete
[37:00] because if you were complete, you
[37:01] wouldn't do that.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Get it? That that's what it was in the
[37:06] beginning. Adam lost something. So now
[37:09] he's incomplete. So obviously being
[37:10] incomplete, he's going to do everything
[37:12] upside down.
[37:14] If you took a person and gave him the
[37:17] fullness of the word from the time he
[37:19] was a child and a perfect environment
[37:21] and let him grow, he would use his free
[37:24] will influenced by the spirit of God.
[37:26] He'd have a far better chance of living
[37:29] righteous and doing something good with
[37:31] his life.
[37:33] &gt;&gt; Right? So really what's a problem with
[37:35] what sin is is incompleteness.
[37:40] Imperfection is incompleteness.
[37:44] So has it been in God and his church
[37:46] that's pulling his bride out? He's
[37:48] creating his bride. Justification under
[37:50] Luther, sanctification under Wesley and
[37:53] so forth. You see he the evolution of
[37:55] the spirit being given more and more
[37:58] causing the body is building cause the
[38:02] body is building coming to the head
[38:04] which is Christ the body of Christ. So
[38:06] that's that diagram that we saw. Amen.
[38:09] So God kind of built the church in a
[38:11] kind of evolution. And if I had to show
[38:14] you in every church in every age every
[38:18] step of those seven steps how different
[38:20] it was. And let's just speak about the
[38:22] first few. If you think of u the church
[38:26] in Jerusalem where it started under Paul
[38:29] and um under the disciples and and
[38:32] started in the Middle East, started in
[38:34] Israel. The church started with Jews.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; They were dressed like Jews. They spoke
[38:43] Hebrew, Aramaic. They spoke like Jews.
[38:46] Um they it started there. That means the
[38:49] civilization the first civilization of
[38:51] Christians were Jewish.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Then it began to spread and then it goes
[38:56] to Rome and it goes to to Turkey. Uh it
[39:00] goes to the what was called Asia Minor
[39:02] where the first church of Ephesus was
[39:04] and Corinth of Rome and then when it
[39:07] reaches France and you got Ireneius of
[39:10] of Leon right so you've got um u
[39:14] different men. Now look at the
[39:16] difference of the church in a different
[39:18] society.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Now under Iranius they're not dressed
[39:23] like Jewish people.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; They're not even speaking the same
[39:26] language.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; They're been they've been speaking Latin
[39:30] they speak French. It moved to Spanish
[39:32] people. So the church in each stage
[39:35] evolving by the people that it is
[39:38] reaching now the the conditions or the
[39:43] trials that they had in Jerusalem are
[39:45] not the same as they had in France are
[39:48] not the same as they had in Germany
[39:50] under Luther or the same as they had in
[39:52] the UK under John Wesley or the same as
[39:54] they had in the United States. They're
[39:56] completely different trials,
[39:59] completely different people, different
[40:01] race groups, different languages. So,
[40:04] can you see how the church is constantly
[40:06] evolving?
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Right? They're absolutely different.
[40:12] I mean, in uh Jerusalem when they sang
[40:17] worship songs in churches, they were
[40:19] called halal. H E L E L. Halal is where
[40:23] the word hymn comes from. H Y M N. To
[40:27] sing a hymn. They take a scripture and
[40:30] they make it into song and they sing
[40:33] that in worship to God. Today we have
[40:35] English hymns based on khal's which were
[40:39] sung in Jerusalem. And now in America
[40:43] we've got this praise and worship mania.
[40:46] It's a completely completely different
[40:49] worship altogether.
[40:51] Yes.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Statue of a Perfect
[40:56] Man Pro 76. So by the fourth age, the
[40:59] church was Catholic.
[41:02] Roman Catholic. We're crying out loud.
[41:05] Lutheran in the fifth, Methodist in the
[41:07] sixth, and Pentecostal by the seventh. I
[41:10] mean, if that doesn't show you an
[41:11] evolution, I don't know what is. They're
[41:14] completely different churches.
[41:17] Paragraph 76. Now the Bible said here
[41:20] that Steven spoke of Solomon building a
[41:22] temple and the most high don't dwell in
[41:24] temples made with hands. For heaven's my
[41:27] throne and earth's my foottool and where
[41:29] is the place of my rest but a body has
[41:32] thou prepared me? Amen. There you are. A
[41:34] body has thou prepared me. So he then
[41:37] says God dwells in the stature of a man
[41:41] reflecting himself into that being.
[41:44] Saints let's get this. God dwells in the
[41:48] stature of a man.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; Reflecting himself. Perfect worship. God
[41:54] in us being his tabernacle. God
[41:56] manifesting. Oh, how we would stay on
[41:58] that till you almost suffocate from the
[42:00] heat. He says, "So stature refers to the
[42:04] spiritual mental growth to maturity of
[42:08] the believer.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?"
[42:11] So spiritually it can be defined the
[42:13] statue of a perfect man can be defined
[42:15] as the development of a man or an
[42:19] individual from a sinful nature into a
[42:23] divine nature.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Now do you know how many religions
[42:28] believe in a divine nature? Everyone.
[42:32] Everyone believes that man can be
[42:33] divine. Every religion on earth believes
[42:37] man can be divine. And they believe man
[42:39] can be divine by God coming upon him.
[42:44] Right?
[42:46] This is the only truth that tells you
[42:49] man was originally divine
[42:52] &gt;&gt; in his own nature.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to see, right?
[42:57] You're not just divine by God coming
[43:00] upon you. Man was created beginning
[43:05] &gt;&gt; being divine.
[43:08] What does that mean? Okay, so let's go
[43:10] to second Peter 1 and we'll take verse
[43:12] three and we'll move on and progress in
[43:15] it. Are you with me? So second Peter 1
[43:18] from verse three. This is where the
[43:20] teaching on statue of a perfect man
[43:22] comes from. So it starts by saying
[43:25] according as and I I've underlined the
[43:28] important phrases we're going to get to
[43:30] according as his divine power. Divine
[43:34] power refers to the Holy Ghost which he
[43:38] gives us freely through our faith in
[43:39] Christ. Okay?
[43:43] According as his divine power, the Holy
[43:45] Ghost hath given to us all things. What
[43:49] is all things? All things refers to
[43:52] everything we needed to see. Attributes,
[43:55] the word, manifestations, miracles. The
[43:59] Holy Ghost gave all things to us.
[44:03] all things that we were not worthy to
[44:05] receive because we were living in sin.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; So, we have no excuse to say that we
[44:12] don't know how to behave godly or
[44:14] perfectly. We've got no excuse today to
[44:16] say we haven't heard the word of God.
[44:19] We've got no more ignorance because all
[44:21] the ignorance has been removed by the
[44:23] truth that has been sent. He has
[44:25] revealed to us every biblical,
[44:28] historical, and worldly example.
[44:32] You have, we literally are a generation
[44:35] that cannot use ignorance as an excuse.
[44:38] We know everything
[44:40] &gt;&gt; he has revealed to us. If you were
[44:42] before Christ, you you could you could
[44:44] say, "Well, I don't know what it really
[44:46] means to be a godly man."
[44:50] But there's no more ignorance after
[44:52] Christ. There's no more ignorance after
[44:54] the church ages. There's no more
[44:55] ignorance after the prophet of this last
[44:57] day. There's no more ignorance after the
[44:58] Bible has been mass- prodduced, printed,
[45:01] and given around the world. In every
[45:03] hotel room, there's a Bible in there.
[45:08] Okay? He has given unto us all things.
[45:11] All things, not just all things, because
[45:13] there's a lot of things out there that's
[45:14] just corruption, but all things that
[45:16] pertain unto life and godliness,
[45:19] &gt;&gt; right? Life and godliness. Life speaks
[45:22] of daily living as a mortal being. That
[45:25] means the word actually tells you how to
[45:27] be a good husband, how to be a righteous
[45:30] man, how to be a good wife, how to be an
[45:32] obedient child. There isn't a single
[45:34] thing that isn't covered in the Bible as
[45:37] to how to be a good human.
[45:42] We literally are without
[45:45] uh excuse because it's covered
[45:48] everything.
[45:49] It's covered sexuality,
[45:52] &gt;&gt; parenting,
[45:54] &gt;&gt; adulthood, manhood, womanhood, sacred
[45:57] virtue. It's covered everything.
[45:59] &gt;&gt; There isn't a single thing that is
[46:01] outstanding
[46:03] for you to just read and be a good human
[46:06] without even having God,
[46:09] &gt;&gt; right? Life
[46:11] and godliness.
[46:13] So godliness refers to the ability to be
[46:17] holy, meaning the ability to be
[46:20] committed to the word of God.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; So he has given us everything that that
[46:26] puts us without ignorance to be a good
[46:29] human
[46:31] &gt;&gt; combined with being dedicated to the
[46:33] word of God. We have everything.
[46:37] We even have grace.
[46:40] grace meaning when we make a mistake we
[46:42] even have that ability afforded us to
[46:44] come back to apologize to say I'm sorry
[46:46] and to receive forgiveness he's even
[46:48] given us that
[46:51] &gt;&gt; right the two words life and godliness
[46:55] in a union if you put them together you
[46:58] have holy living
[47:01] so what then is holy living is living a
[47:04] life of a decent righteous human being
[47:09] committed to the purpose of the word of
[47:11] God. Holy means to be committed to the
[47:14] purpose of the word
[47:15] &gt;&gt; of God.
[47:17] Living a righteous life is just a good
[47:21] thing to do. So let me tell you there
[47:24] are so many good people in the world.
[47:27] Righteous people remember we spoke about
[47:30] this recently. Uh I spoke about in
[47:32] Durban. There are many, many people in
[47:35] the world who are righteous, but they're
[47:38] just righteous.
[47:39] They're not righteous and committed to
[47:41] God's word. They're righteous where it
[47:46] benefits them. Like for example,
[47:49] it benefits you to be a righteous
[47:51] person. Like if you if you read the
[47:53] words of Christ in the Gospels, it tells
[47:55] you make friends with those who are of
[47:58] mammon. In other words, don't be
[48:00] disrespectful
[48:02] to people who have a lot of money,
[48:05] mammon, business people. Why? Because in
[48:08] the times of your need, they're the ones
[48:09] who will help you. This is literally
[48:11] advice from Christ. It's common sense.
[48:13] It's logic. Don't go and protest against
[48:16] your government. They'll kill you.
[48:19] Respect your employers because they've
[48:21] they pay you and give you bread.
[48:24] That's not mysteries, spiritual
[48:27] mysteries. There's literally
[48:29] righteousness. There's so many people in
[48:31] the world who haven't read those words
[48:33] of Christ and abide by those principles.
[48:36] Why? Because it benefits them to be
[48:38] righteous.
[48:41] But to to be righteous and committed to
[48:45] God's word is godly living,
[48:49] life and godliness. You got it? Then it
[48:52] says through the knowledge of him. So
[48:55] how can you be how can you have all
[48:57] things uh pertaining unto life and
[48:59] godliness? Through the knowledge of him.
[49:01] What is the knowledge of him? Christ.
[49:05] All things are given through knowing
[49:07] him.
[49:09] Who is Christ? The mystery of God
[49:12] revealed.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's uh in the book of
[49:18] Colossians. So unto you it is given to
[49:20] know the kingdom of God, but unto them
[49:22] it is not given. In other words, so a
[49:25] lot of people will read the Bible. Bible
[49:28] will look like mysteries. Uh there'll be
[49:31] like parables and mysteries and things
[49:33] like that. They'll stumble at it. What
[49:34] is he talking about? What does this
[49:36] mean? You know, what's going on here? I
[49:37] don't understand. So to them, it'll
[49:39] always remain parables and mysteries.
[49:41] But to the elect, you'll break into that
[49:43] and find the secret.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; Find the truth hidden in there. Is that
[49:47] right? So if you know Christ, then you
[49:51] have what it takes to know all that
[49:53] pertains to life and godliness. Are we
[49:57] making your scriptures plain?
[50:00] Then it says uh the knowledge of him
[50:03] that hath called us, the word called
[50:08] us is elected chosen.
[50:12] Right? In other words, it it uh caught
[50:15] our attention. It sounds like one thing
[50:18] called us. But then called us to is
[50:22] something else. So you're not just your
[50:25] attention is caught by a call. It's not
[50:27] just that. It's not saying, "Hey, come.
[50:29] I'm calling you to be a Christian." No,
[50:31] he called us to something.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; That's different. This speaks of like
[50:37] breeding. Like in other words, uh you're
[50:41] bred, you're being bred for a purpose.
[50:43] You're being raised. You've been
[50:45] trained. You've been called to a
[50:47] purpose. Much like a racehorse.
[50:51] You know, raceh horses, you don't just
[50:53] walk around and see a horse in a field
[50:54] and say, "Hey, I'm going to make that a
[50:56] racehorse." No. That fell is not He's
[50:58] got a stubborn nature him. He's not
[51:00] going to race. He's not going to eat the
[51:01] food you want. He's not He's not going
[51:03] to listen to you. He's not going to let
[51:05] you put a saddle on him. He's not going
[51:07] to let you ride him. There's no way. You
[51:09] don't just walk around in a field and
[51:10] just go and take some some horse that
[51:13] was born between a horse and a and a
[51:15] donkey and say, "I want to make you a
[51:17] raceh horse." Doesn't work like that. A
[51:19] racehorse is born and bred for the task.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; He's got to be born of racing lineage.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; He's going to have that blood in him.
[51:28] He's got to have the genetics to want to
[51:30] move at full speed.
[51:34] He's going to grow up with a mother who
[51:36] was a racehorse, with a father who was a
[51:37] racehorse, who will teach him the the
[51:40] characteristics of being a racehorse
[51:43] &gt;&gt; as opposed to a donkey
[51:46] or a mule, right? Because you can sit on
[51:50] a mule and whip it and beat it and shout
[51:52] it and it's not going to move. It's not
[51:54] going to race. It's going to look at
[51:55] other horses running so fast and think,
[51:57] "Nah, I don't want to do that. There's
[52:00] no way I'm doing that." you know,
[52:02] wasting my strength to run from one
[52:03] point to another. What for? No, thank
[52:06] you. I want to eat some grass. You can
[52:08] dig your spurs into his side. He'll turn
[52:10] around and bite you.
[52:13] Completely different. You can't take the
[52:15] word of God and try to tame a nature
[52:17] like that. So called to means he's going
[52:21] to breed you to that. How do you breed
[52:24] someone? You give them the knowledge of
[52:27] him,
[52:28] &gt;&gt; the knowledge of life and godliness, the
[52:30] divine power to do so, which is the Holy
[52:33] Ghost.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; You cannot do this on your own.
[52:37] So this call we saw in predestination,
[52:39] we are not aware of the effects and the
[52:41] influence of the Holy Spirit in our
[52:42] life. Uh we only know that it is leading
[52:45] us somewhere. Like before you came to
[52:47] Christ, you didn't even know the Holy
[52:49] Spirit was leading you. You didn't even
[52:51] know you were being bred for a purpose.
[52:53] You were being called for a purpose. You
[52:55] didn't even know there were trials
[52:57] happening in your life already starting
[52:59] you off. You were totally unaware that
[53:01] it was happening.
[53:03] Only years later, you know, uh you find
[53:06] people come and they come to the front.
[53:07] They testify and they say, "Do you know
[53:09] what happened to me in my life? I only
[53:10] realize it now. What happened then?"
[53:13] Amen.
[53:15] So then it comes to glory and virtue. So
[53:19] you are being called to glory and
[53:22] virtue. Glory speaks of immortality,
[53:27] honor, respect, a heavenly state or
[53:31] condition. To be to be glorified means
[53:35] to to be made more than you actually
[53:38] are.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Right. And virtue speaks of moral
[53:43] excellence,
[53:44] purity, chastity. Which human can ever
[53:49] attain this on their own? No one. Unless
[53:53] you are given God's word, unless you are
[53:55] given his holy spirit, there's no way
[53:57] you can you can attain this.
[54:00] The Bible actually tells you that any
[54:02] man who says he has not sinned, let him
[54:04] be a liar.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; These two words, glory and virtue, when
[54:10] you put them together in union, speaks
[54:12] of heavenly virtue, beauty, splendor,
[54:16] not natural beauty. We're talking about
[54:17] the beauty of character. Amen. Let's go
[54:20] to verse four. 2 Peter 1:4
[54:23] whereby
[54:25] whereby that means from what was in the
[54:28] verse before those all those attributes
[54:32] the word the manifestation um called
[54:35] unto glory and virtue whereby are given
[54:38] unto us
[54:40] given to us means it's freely given
[54:43] you didn't pay for it right it's a free
[54:46] gift us who is us the called ones Amen.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Exceeding and great precious promises.
[54:55] That is what the gifts abilities of the
[54:58] church, gifts of the spirit, the
[55:00] five-fold ministry, revelation of
[55:02] prophecies that by these by what? By
[55:08] these exceeding great and precious
[55:10] promises,
[55:12] right? by the gifts, by the five-fold
[55:15] ministry, by the anointing of the
[55:17] church, by the word that is sent, by
[55:19] these. Here's what we're coming to.
[55:23] You might be partakers of the divine
[55:26] nature.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; There is our title, partakers of the
[55:30] divine nature.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Right? So, what is partaker?
[55:36] Okay, literally flop it around. Flip it
[55:39] around. taking part in
[55:42] &gt;&gt; yes
[55:43] &gt;&gt; or joining in or becoming a part of
[55:48] eating of something
[55:50] right so let's read stature of a perfect
[55:53] man u paragraph 40 41 42 43 44
[55:59] are you still with me saints
[56:01] &gt;&gt; so he says I might say something here
[56:03] reason someone got me all wrong here not
[56:05] long ago I got a letter from ministerial
[56:07] association that said I believed there.
[56:10] We were soulmated. We must leave. So,
[56:13] let me explain to you the these are one
[56:15] of the travesties
[56:17] of Christian theology that just went
[56:20] horribly wrong. And I don't know why and
[56:22] how they got into the story. But to me,
[56:25] I think I know why. Cuz a guy's married
[56:28] to a woman and then he sees another
[56:30] pretty girl and then he makes a a
[56:32] theological reason, a Christian reason
[56:34] why he can leave this one and take
[56:36] another one. Right? That's what he's
[56:39] saying is happening. So what? Let let me
[56:40] explain. He says, "So the ministerial
[56:43] association that I believe said we were
[56:46] soulmated and we must leave our
[56:48] companions if we're not soulmated to
[56:50] them. To marry another one that we are
[56:53] soulmated to."
[56:56] Oh my. I said, I'm not guilty of a
[56:58] heresy like that.
[57:01] I've always been against that. I don't
[57:03] believe in that. And certainly not. I
[57:06] believe that God gives us a mate. That's
[57:09] true. That means God approves of your
[57:12] choice
[57:13] and then we become a part of each other.
[57:16] This is beautiful, right? So you are two
[57:19] completely different people from
[57:20] different families, different
[57:22] bloodlines, different natures, different
[57:24] homes, different cultures, whatever,
[57:26] different cities, wherever you come
[57:28] from. And then you become you meet one
[57:31] another, you become married and then you
[57:33] become a part of one another. How do you
[57:36] become a part of one another,
[57:39] right? By partaking of a singular
[57:42] purpose.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; And that's right. Before a man gets
[57:48] married, he should think these things
[57:50] over and study it. Paragraph 44. A young
[57:54] man asked me the other day, "You think I
[57:56] ought to get married, brother man, to
[57:58] such and such a girl?" I said, "How much
[58:00] do you think of her?" He said, "Oh my, I
[58:02] just love her." So, this is the only
[58:05] reason one should be married. I said,
[58:08] "Well, if you're not going to live
[58:10] without her, you better marry her then.
[58:12] But if you can live without her, you
[58:14] better not."
[58:17] So, here's the criterion. But if it's
[58:19] going to kill you, you better go ahead
[58:22] and get married. That means it's
[58:23] basically saying if you have this real
[58:27] hole inside that nobody else can fill
[58:30] but her or him then it's only right that
[58:34] you get married. Right? And so what I
[58:37] was trying to get, he said, what I was
[58:38] trying to get to him was that if you
[58:40] love her so much now, right now before
[58:42] you get married, everything's just fine
[58:44] and dandy. But after you get married,
[58:48] then the toils and trials of life come
[58:50] in.
[58:52] That's when you've got to be so in love
[58:54] that you understand one another. When
[58:57] you're disappointed in her, so or she's
[59:00] disappointed in you, you'll still
[59:03] understand one another. That's the way
[59:06] it is with Christ. So I read that not to
[59:10] talk about marriages. This is where
[59:12] we're heading to. He's using that to
[59:14] tell you that's the way it is with
[59:16] Christ. And this is the reason people
[59:19] fail. Leave the message, leave
[59:21] Christianity, leave God, become
[59:23] atheists. Why? Because you didn't get to
[59:26] know him.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; You went into this for what you can get
[59:31] out of it.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; And then when you don't get what you
[59:33] want, then you leave.
[59:37] So, we've got to be so in love with him,
[59:39] with God, till when we ask for something
[59:42] and he doesn't give it to us, it doesn't
[59:46] shake us a bit.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; See why? Now, watch this. The only way
[59:52] you can do that is to become partakers
[59:55] of his divine nature.
[59:59] There it is.
[1:00:01] There is no way you can ever then you'll
[1:00:04] understand the reason he can't give it
[1:00:07] to you partakers of his divine nature.
[1:00:10] What is this telling us? This is the the
[1:00:13] problem with people today because God
[1:00:15] doesn't give them healing for cancer or
[1:00:17] God doesn't give them the job that they
[1:00:19] want or because God doesn't give them
[1:00:21] whatever. They pray, they pray, they
[1:00:23] pray, they fast and pray and they do all
[1:00:25] kinds of things and God doesn't give it
[1:00:26] to them and they get deflated.
[1:00:30] Okay, I'm I'm done. I've been such a
[1:00:32] good person. Really? Have you really
[1:00:34] been that good to deserve everything?
[1:00:40] That's being a bit hypocritical right
[1:00:41] there. Most people Most people, I can't
[1:00:44] tell you how many times as a pastor, I
[1:00:46] get people coming and telling me, "I
[1:00:48] don't understand. Uh, you know, I did
[1:00:51] this right, I did that, right? I've been
[1:00:53] coming to church. I'm reading my Bible.
[1:00:55] I'm praying and uh I've asked God for
[1:00:58] this and he hasn't given it to me and
[1:01:00] you know and uh as a minister of the
[1:01:03] open book I'm standing there looking at
[1:01:05] this. I'm feeling sorry for you because
[1:01:08] I understand your condition. I
[1:01:09] understand the pain you're in. I
[1:01:11] understand the troubles you're going
[1:01:13] through. I'm going through troubles
[1:01:14] myself all the time. Everyone else is
[1:01:16] going through. But you are really making
[1:01:18] your troubles more important than your
[1:01:21] faith in God.
[1:01:23] And I'm listening to these excuses and
[1:01:25] I'm thinking you are right now judging
[1:01:29] God for not being what he says he is.
[1:01:34] And in that moment you are saying you
[1:01:37] are everything you say you are.
[1:01:42] That is what I call hypocritical because
[1:01:45] there is no human that can tell me that
[1:01:48] you are being everything faithful to God
[1:01:51] exactly the way you're supposed to be.
[1:01:53] If we every one of us go back and check
[1:01:55] our lives, we fail miserably.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; It is a very immature for a person to
[1:02:03] come and and be so immature to say God
[1:02:05] hasn't given me this. Therefore, I'm
[1:02:07] leaving. Therefore, I'm forsaking him.
[1:02:09] I'm becoming an atheist. I don't want to
[1:02:11] believe anymore. For you to do that
[1:02:13] shows you never parttook of the divine
[1:02:15] nature in the first place.
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he had to put out the divine
[1:02:24] nature to the church
[1:02:26] for you to partake of it and wait for
[1:02:30] the divine nature to produce his
[1:02:32] soulmate in the end. One whom he died
[1:02:35] for. One who would die for him. someone
[1:02:40] who would not be able to live without
[1:02:42] him that it would kill me not to be
[1:02:45] without or or or to be without him to be
[1:02:48] without him would destroy me. I have no
[1:02:51] life outside of him.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; The entire experience of the church ages
[1:02:57] was a relationship of the Holy Ghost to
[1:03:00] man to educate fallen men to understand
[1:03:02] the divine nature. All right. So during
[1:03:05] this series, what we're what we're doing
[1:03:06] today is just the introduction, right?
[1:03:08] During this series, we are going to
[1:03:10] break down the divine nature, what it
[1:03:12] is. But I want to bring a specific point
[1:03:15] to you today.
[1:03:17] We are not talking about the divine
[1:03:19] nature of the immortal self-existing
[1:03:24] one who was before the world was the
[1:03:28] great fountain of life. What divine
[1:03:30] nature are we talking about? We are
[1:03:32] talking about the divine nature of man.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:03:38] All those natures, faith, virtue,
[1:03:40] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:03:42] godliness, brotherly kindness, they are
[1:03:44] natures of man.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; Why does God need godliness?
[1:03:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; How is godliness a nature of God?
[1:03:57] What God must be God must be like God.
[1:04:01] Patience.
[1:04:04] You really think patience is a virtue of
[1:04:06] God? God is eternal. Why does he need
[1:04:09] patience? There's no time in there.
[1:04:12] What patience must he have? These
[1:04:15] natures are divine natures of man, which
[1:04:18] tells you when man was first created, he
[1:04:20] was divine. He had a divine nature which
[1:04:23] he fell from. Why? Because man was
[1:04:26] originally in the image of God. He was
[1:04:28] made in the image of God.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; He had a divine nature to begin with and
[1:04:32] he lost the divine nature of man. So
[1:04:35] those seven virtues are the divine
[1:04:37] nature of man and the capstone is the
[1:04:39] divine nature of God coming down making
[1:04:42] the whole thing complete.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; If you if you think about it, we're
[1:04:48] going to get through this. Temperance is
[1:04:51] to control one's nature.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Does God need temperance?
[1:04:56] Does the great fountain of life need to
[1:04:59] control his tongue? How he speaks? Is
[1:05:02] that a nature of him from before the
[1:05:05] world began? No. Only a man needs
[1:05:09] control.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; See, that's what we mean by we are
[1:05:14] first. Before you even partake of the
[1:05:16] fountain of life, you need to be
[1:05:18] partakers of the divine nature that was
[1:05:21] of man from before the fall.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; So the nature in something, what is the
[1:05:28] nature? What is the nature that is in a
[1:05:31] dog?
[1:05:32] Right? What is the nature in a cat? What
[1:05:34] is the nature in a bird? What does
[1:05:36] nature mean? The nature of something is
[1:05:41] its identification
[1:05:43] is its name. The nature of something is
[1:05:47] what it is.
[1:05:50] If you take the word dog, it means
[1:05:52] nothing.
[1:05:55] It's a word. Cow means nothing. I
[1:05:58] remember once telling you when the
[1:06:00] Americans
[1:06:02] uh met the the the natives of North
[1:06:06] America and we have this English word
[1:06:09] cow
[1:06:11] which most people if I tell you please
[1:06:14] explain to me what cow means you cannot
[1:06:17] tell me the word itself means nothing.
[1:06:21] It it actually means a femi a female
[1:06:24] bovine.
[1:06:27] Nobody uses the word bovine,
[1:06:30] right? And uh it is female. Um if we had
[1:06:34] to explain it, you would say a cow is an
[1:06:39] animal
[1:06:40] that grazes on grass. It has hoofs. It's
[1:06:44] covered in hair. It has a tail. It
[1:06:47] produces milk and it makes the moo
[1:06:51] sound. And it has a very horizontal
[1:06:54] back. It's got large ears, large eyes, a
[1:06:58] big square nose, and it's got uh horns
[1:07:02] sometimes. And there's this whole uh
[1:07:06] description you can give me. But tell me
[1:07:08] that whole description comes from the
[1:07:10] word cow.
[1:07:12] No, it doesn't. The word cow means
[1:07:14] nothing. It's a word. How do we teach
[1:07:17] ourselves it is cow? Because when we're
[1:07:19] in primary school, they show us the word
[1:07:21] c
[1:07:23] and they show you a picture. So in your
[1:07:25] mind, you learn by association.
[1:07:28] So you see the picture of the cow, you
[1:07:29] see the word of the cow, the word that
[1:07:31] says cow, and then you put them together
[1:07:33] in your brain. That's your brain. That's
[1:07:35] called education,
[1:07:37] right? Association.
[1:07:39] Nobody told you the meaning. So some of
[1:07:42] you come in primary school, you've never
[1:07:43] seen a cow in your life. If you just
[1:07:45] seen a picture and you see the word and
[1:07:47] you now say, "I know what is cow." You
[1:07:49] have no idea what cow is.
[1:07:52] You have no idea what cattle is until
[1:07:54] you actually seen them, touched them,
[1:07:57] been among them, got their smell, see
[1:08:00] what they do with their life. There is a
[1:08:02] nature about this creature
[1:08:05] which no singular name can define.
[1:08:09] And like I was saying, when the
[1:08:10] Americans met the uh the uh the the Red
[1:08:14] Indians, they um they found that the Red
[1:08:17] Indians have a word and the word means
[1:08:20] the animal with the big wet nose.
[1:08:24] That's way more descriptive than cow,
[1:08:28] right? You'll actually find if if you
[1:08:30] look in the African languages, the words
[1:08:33] that the Africans have for anything is
[1:08:36] far better than English.
[1:08:39] because it explains something about
[1:08:41] something. It actually identifies a
[1:08:44] particular aspect of its nature.
[1:08:46] We took the word dog and then added to
[1:08:49] it to mean, you know, he's like a dog.
[1:08:53] But the word itself doesn't tell you
[1:08:55] what dog is. You understand this? This
[1:08:58] is the point. There's so much more to
[1:09:00] what nature is. Nature is the actual
[1:09:04] name of something.
[1:09:06] Nature is the actual identity of a
[1:09:09] thing.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Right? So when you talk about the divine
[1:09:13] nature, you're talking about the actual
[1:09:16] supernatural or rather spiritual name of
[1:09:20] man, the spiritual the godlike nature of
[1:09:24] man.
[1:09:26] Right now in the world, you are not
[1:09:27] seeing that in people. You are not
[1:09:29] seeing the godlike. And when people say
[1:09:33] he's a god, they're talking about a
[1:09:35] Hollywood star or Elon Musk or somebody
[1:09:37] who created some amazing thing. How is
[1:09:40] he a god? How are they gods? What do you
[1:09:42] mean by their god? Because you admire
[1:09:44] them.
[1:09:47] A man can shoot rockets into space but
[1:09:49] can't keep one marriage.
[1:09:54] Can't raise up children properly. Can't
[1:09:56] dress decently. can't speak decently.
[1:10:00] All these people, how are they gods?
[1:10:03] They can't even keep their own emotions
[1:10:05] under check. They can't even speak with
[1:10:07] temperance. They've got no patience.
[1:10:09] They can't survive without substances.
[1:10:13] How is that a god?
[1:10:15] It's not even godlike. Which means the
[1:10:18] whole idea of god to this modern world
[1:10:21] is completely messed up.
[1:10:24] And then we call Hollywood people stars,
[1:10:27] celebrities.
[1:10:31] Uh,
[1:10:32] you know, love to take those stars and
[1:10:35] bring them here to Africa and take them
[1:10:38] to a rural hut and ask them if they
[1:10:41] could survive. See what kind of god and
[1:10:43] stars they are. Hey, they'll be out of
[1:10:46] there in 1 hour.
[1:10:49] Hm. Because they've they've been served
[1:10:51] hand and foot for so long. They have
[1:10:54] their children taken care of by other
[1:10:56] people. Can you live? Can those stars
[1:10:59] live in a place where you've got no
[1:11:02] running water except in the river?
[1:11:04] There's no sanitation. There's nobody.
[1:11:07] You've got to literally go out and plant
[1:11:09] your own food. You to bring up your own
[1:11:11] cattle. Who's the star then? To me,
[1:11:14] those people in the rural areas are are
[1:11:17] much greater stars than those fellows
[1:11:18] out there driving Lamborghinis.
[1:11:22] That's a real star. Someone who when
[1:11:24] everything crashes will still survive.
[1:11:26] That's incredible. Humans, I tell you,
[1:11:30] what what looks like common sense today
[1:11:32] is disastrous. It's It's beyond me.
[1:11:34] Statue of a perfect man. Paragraph of
[1:11:36] 89.
[1:11:38] It's like a mule trying to manufacture
[1:11:40] wool, trying to be a sheep when he's a
[1:11:43] wolf or he's a mule. You see, he can't
[1:11:45] manufacture wool. This is such a simple
[1:11:49] example, but so true. He can't do it.
[1:11:51] Wool is a gift to a sheep, not to a
[1:11:53] mule. He might try to act like a sheep,
[1:11:56] but he's still a mule. I see. So, you
[1:11:58] say, "I can't eat like a sheep. I can't
[1:12:00] do this like a sheep. Oh, I can eat like
[1:12:02] a sheep. I can do this like a sheep."
[1:12:04] And no matter what you can do, you've
[1:12:06] got to be a sheep in order to have wool.
[1:12:07] In other words, you can make you can
[1:12:10] take a mule. You know what's a mule,
[1:12:11] right? A mule is a hybrid horse.
[1:12:15] A mule is a hybrid between a donkey and
[1:12:18] a horse, right? He's sterile. He can
[1:12:21] never produce procreate another mule.
[1:12:25] So you can keep him among sheep. He'll
[1:12:28] eat grass with the sheep. He'll live
[1:12:31] with the sheep. You can live in the same
[1:12:33] pen. You can give him the same water.
[1:12:36] So, same diet,
[1:12:38] uh, same everything, but he's never
[1:12:41] going to produce wool
[1:12:43] and he's never going to make the sound
[1:12:44] of a sheep because that cannot be
[1:12:46] manufactured.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Right? 90. Let me stop here a minute.
[1:12:52] The sheep doesn't manufacture will.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; He has will.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Because he's a sheep. A lot of people
[1:12:59] trying to say now what what's he talking
[1:13:01] about? You as a Christian, you don't you
[1:13:05] don't manufacture Christianity.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; As a man of God, you don't manufacture
[1:13:11] divine nature.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; You have it,
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; right? You don't say, "I'm trying my
[1:13:18] best to be a Christian." You either are,
[1:13:21] you're not.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; Well, I try to get good. I'll try to do
[1:13:25] this. Don't manufacture nothing. You
[1:13:28] can't do it. A sheep doesn't isn't
[1:13:30] expected to manufacture wool. It bears
[1:13:32] wool. It it does because it's a sheep.
[1:13:35] And when you're a Christian, you just
[1:13:38] bear the fruit of the spirit. You don't
[1:13:40] manufacture it. You don't try to make it
[1:13:42] up. You just try make yourself something
[1:13:44] that you're not. You just become what
[1:13:47] you're supposed to be and then it takes
[1:13:49] care of itself.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Have you heard people say, I'm still
[1:13:52] reading, well, I tell you, I joined a
[1:13:54] church. I really ought to quit this
[1:13:55] lying. You're trying to manufacture
[1:13:58] something again now. You can't do it.
[1:14:02] So there's no need of trying to know
[1:14:04] more than a mule can make himself wool.
[1:14:07] He can't do it. Or a vulture trying to
[1:14:10] eat with a dove. A vulture trying to be
[1:14:12] a dove. Could you imagine a buzzard out
[1:14:14] there saying, "Well, you know, I'm a
[1:14:16] dove." Put a few feathers on him. See,
[1:14:19] in other words, you can even dress
[1:14:21] people up like Christians. It doesn't
[1:14:22] make him Christian.
[1:14:24] He is just all out of shape. That's a
[1:14:27] man who professes to be something when
[1:14:29] he is not. See, you can't do it. So
[1:14:33] saints, this nature cannot be
[1:14:35] fabricated.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; It must be bred into you. You have to be
[1:14:38] a part of the process. You have to be a
[1:14:40] partaker of the divine nature. All
[1:14:43] right? So first 2 Peter 1:5-7.
[1:14:48] And besides this, giving all diligence.
[1:14:50] So here's your virtues. Here's those
[1:14:51] seven steps. Watch what it says. Add to
[1:14:54] your faith virtue and to virtue
[1:14:56] knowledge and to knowledge temperance
[1:14:58] and to temperance patience and to
[1:15:00] patience godliness and to godliness
[1:15:02] brotherly kindness and to brotherly
[1:15:03] kindness charity. Notice it's a
[1:15:06] progression.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; He's not saying add to faith charity.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; You're not going to get there.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; You have to add to faith virtue and to
[1:15:16] virtue knowledge. And notice he's now
[1:15:19] saying add to
[1:15:22] That means you've got to get the first
[1:15:24] step. You've got to be a partaker of
[1:15:26] that and then you add the next one,
[1:15:29] right? And when we get into the series,
[1:15:31] I'm going to show you how it actually
[1:15:33] works. It's so simple.
[1:15:36] So, uh, paragraph 18,
[1:15:40] uh, sorry, 2 Peter 1:8 verse 8-10. Now,
[1:15:44] this is what I love about it. Are you
[1:15:46] all still with me?
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:15:49] It says, "For if these things, what
[1:15:51] things?" The virtues,
[1:15:54] right? Faith, virtue, knowledge,
[1:15:56] temperance, patience, godliness,
[1:15:58] brotherly kindness, and charity, love,
[1:16:00] the capstone, eight things. If these
[1:16:04] things be in you and abound,
[1:16:08] they shall make you that you shall be
[1:16:10] neither barren nor unfruitful in the
[1:16:13] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But
[1:16:16] he that lackth these things is blind
[1:16:20] and cannot see a far off and hath
[1:16:23] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:16:25] old sins. Wherefore the rather,
[1:16:28] brethren, give diligence to make your
[1:16:29] calling and election sure. For if you do
[1:16:32] these things, you shall never fall.
[1:16:36] So not just having a percentage of the
[1:16:38] attributes, but the fullness of it.
[1:16:40] Right?
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; We need everything.
[1:16:43] What is barrenness and unfruitfulness?
[1:16:46] Not being able to be effective in the
[1:16:49] purpose of God.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; Right? A person that is not built up in
[1:16:54] these virtues, it says you are blind.
[1:16:58] What does blindness mean? You lack
[1:17:00] vision.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; It means you are unable to be ambitious
[1:17:04] for the gospel.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; It says you cannot read the times and
[1:17:10] you you cannot see a far off. You cannot
[1:17:12] read the time that you're living in.
[1:17:14] This is why you have people in 2025
[1:17:19] following a Catholic doctrine from the
[1:17:22] the dark ages. Lutheranism from
[1:17:26] Germany's time, from Martin Luther's
[1:17:28] time, sticking to orthodoxies
[1:17:32] from a previous time that cannot apply
[1:17:36] to today.
[1:17:39] You're blind.
[1:17:40] You cannot see a far off. You cannot
[1:17:42] even recognize the day you're in and
[1:17:43] what is necessary for today. Why? Why
[1:17:47] would that happen? Because you don't
[1:17:48] have these virtues. You're not partaking
[1:17:50] of the divine nature. Therefore, you
[1:17:52] cannot do it. Right? He cannot work
[1:17:55] together with people toward a common
[1:17:58] cause. To me, the next part is what is
[1:18:02] crucial.
[1:18:03] If ever there was a reason why people
[1:18:06] fall into a backsliden state and not
[1:18:08] know it, here it is.
[1:18:11] He says not knowing these virtues makes
[1:18:15] you lose the joy of your salvation. It
[1:18:18] says you have forgotten
[1:18:21] that you were purged from your old sins.
[1:18:28] Listen, you read again. He that lackth
[1:18:31] these things
[1:18:33] has forgotten that he has he was purged
[1:18:36] from his all all sins. That means if you
[1:18:39] came to Christ, you repented, you
[1:18:41] waterbaptized, you gave your life to
[1:18:43] Christ, and then you did not partake of
[1:18:45] the divine nature, you eventually reach
[1:18:48] a point in your life where you forget
[1:18:49] your salvation.
[1:18:53] Let's say you got to the fourth stage
[1:18:55] and stopped there. You reach a stage in
[1:18:57] your life where you backslide because
[1:18:59] you forgot who you were. You literally
[1:19:01] forgot that Christ died for your sin.
[1:19:04] You forgot the joy of your salvation.
[1:19:07] Why? Because you stop feeding on the
[1:19:10] divine nature.
[1:19:12] You stop partaking of the divine nature.
[1:19:15] Literally makes you reach a point where
[1:19:17] you forget you're purging from your sin.
[1:19:20] You lose the the treasure of having your
[1:19:23] sins forgiven.
[1:19:27] So knowing this saints, let us therefore
[1:19:30] be partakers of the divine nature. All
[1:19:32] right, let's bring this to a close.
[1:19:35] So these seven virtues plus one. I'm
[1:19:37] going to put it that way, right? Faith,
[1:19:39] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:19:40] godliness, brotherly kindness, and
[1:19:42] charity. Seven virtues in the pyramid
[1:19:45] plus one, which is the capstone. Are you
[1:19:47] with me? These eight virtues or
[1:19:51] attributes mentioned that we saw in the
[1:19:54] pyramid, each one of them is a mystery
[1:19:57] on its own
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; that we need to have revealed. Then all
[1:20:01] eight. So for example, you can have
[1:20:04] faith
[1:20:06] which many people have faith but we need
[1:20:08] to show the difference between anybody
[1:20:10] else's faith and someone who's partaken
[1:20:13] of the original divine nature. Let's
[1:20:17] understand the reason we have godlike
[1:20:19] men in the world today creating massive
[1:20:22] things, building amazing things is
[1:20:24] because they are piggybacking of an
[1:20:27] original nature.
[1:20:29] This is the truth.
[1:20:32] All eight and the way they are placed
[1:20:34] according to the word is another
[1:20:36] mystery. So each one on its own is a
[1:20:38] mystery and the way it is placed is a
[1:20:40] mystery. Right? And they are the most
[1:20:43] sought after natures or character traits
[1:20:46] in the world. Every single one of those
[1:20:49] natures, every religion teaches it.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; It doesn't. And every religion teaches
[1:20:58] you to be good. Yes,
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; there's very few religions that tell
[1:21:02] you, you know, to be a bad person.
[1:21:05] I think most of them don't, except for a
[1:21:08] few things like you can you can kill in
[1:21:10] the name of God or something like that
[1:21:12] or you could do this or that. But almost
[1:21:14] every single religion created by man
[1:21:17] that has scriptures tells you to be
[1:21:19] righteous, to be a good husband, be a
[1:21:21] good wife, to bring up children the
[1:21:23] right way, to be patient, to be
[1:21:24] enduring, to be self-sacrificial, to be
[1:21:26] humble. All those things are in there.
[1:21:29] They're all coveted attributes by all
[1:21:33] religions.
[1:21:34] Everybody knows. It's not those things
[1:21:36] are not a mystery. Everybody wants to
[1:21:39] believe they have faith
[1:21:42] or they have temperance or they are
[1:21:44] patient. All religions teach the same
[1:21:47] thing. They all teach no matter what
[1:21:49] their beliefs they uh that holy people
[1:21:53] ought to have all these eight things.
[1:21:56] Some of the religions have charity as
[1:21:58] number one and they they believe charity
[1:22:01] means giving to the poor. But you know
[1:22:04] uh in the word it says though I give to
[1:22:06] the poor and have no charity. I am is
[1:22:08] nothing.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; So they are right. All religions they
[1:22:13] are right. Only they have made up ways
[1:22:15] to get to them. They believe they are
[1:22:18] things we can do to get to them. You can
[1:22:21] do a certain amount of prayers to get to
[1:22:23] them. You can do a certain amount of
[1:22:25] meditation to get to them. You have to
[1:22:26] do a certain amount of work to attain
[1:22:30] something to attain patience. You have
[1:22:33] to uh dress up in a certain way. You
[1:22:36] have to live a certain lifestyle of
[1:22:38] abstinence to obtain something. And
[1:22:40] every single one of those things has
[1:22:42] proven to be disastrously wrong because
[1:22:46] eventually the more you can achieve
[1:22:49] something by your own strength, the more
[1:22:51] it tends to pride. You'll eventually
[1:22:53] come out and say, "Well, I meditated for
[1:22:56] so long today and I feel closer to God."
[1:22:59] Why are you telling me this? Cuz you're
[1:23:01] proud of yourself for having done that.
[1:23:03] You've already gotten to pride without
[1:23:05] realizing it. I've brought so many souls
[1:23:08] to Christ. Why are you telling us that?
[1:23:12] I I I've baptized so many people in my
[1:23:14] life. Why are you telling us that?
[1:23:16] That's not supposed to be something you
[1:23:17] brag about or even have to tell other
[1:23:19] people about. If you really had the
[1:23:21] divine nature, there's no reason to tell
[1:23:23] anyone.
[1:23:27] So all religions are right. They all
[1:23:30] tell you good things. Be good people.
[1:23:32] That's common sense. We even meet some
[1:23:35] people of the world who have some. You
[1:23:38] meet people who don't go to church who
[1:23:40] are of a different religion who are
[1:23:43] maybe even atheist and they are good
[1:23:45] people. They nicer than some of you.
[1:23:50] They're more forgiving. They give to the
[1:23:52] poor. They they give a whole lot more to
[1:23:54] the poor than you might.
[1:23:57] They might even have happier marriages
[1:23:59] than some of you.
[1:24:01] They argue less with their spouses.
[1:24:05] Right?
[1:24:06] Those who have them with measure are
[1:24:09] often respected for it. Right? You can
[1:24:13] you can meet a you know one of the the
[1:24:16] most judged people in the world are
[1:24:17] doctors, right? You ever go to a
[1:24:19] hospital and you go to and you from the
[1:24:21] time you're lying in that bed and
[1:24:22] they're busy poking and proddding you
[1:24:24] and talking to you, you're already
[1:24:25] judging them. So you come out of there,
[1:24:27] you'll say, "Hey, that doctor's a good
[1:24:28] doctor." Why? Oh, he's so patient. He's
[1:24:31] so kind. He's so gentle. You're actually
[1:24:34] telling you telling us all the virtues
[1:24:36] this man has, all the natures. He's so
[1:24:39] patient.
[1:24:41] You should go to him.
[1:24:44] Right? So the prophet calls these
[1:24:47] attributes virtues for a good reason. To
[1:24:50] fully understand these things, we need
[1:24:52] to first understand why God chose to
[1:24:54] call them virtues and why they are
[1:24:56] placed the way they are. Prophet desired
[1:24:59] to do a study but never really got into
[1:25:01] it. But I believe he left the hint for
[1:25:03] us. Let's go to Statue of Perfect Man,
[1:25:06] paragraph 345.
[1:25:08] See what I mean? See how these virtues?
[1:25:10] These building materials.
[1:25:14] What are these virtues? Building
[1:25:16] materials typed in with the church
[1:25:19] messengers.
[1:25:20] So the building materials brought in by
[1:25:23] the church messengers with the church
[1:25:25] ages. Let's go to u paragraph three on
[1:25:29] page 24. The next quote.
[1:25:33] Oh, sorry. Let's go back to the other
[1:25:35] one. The last paragraph there. So now
[1:25:38] one of these days we're going to take
[1:25:40] each one of these words and study them
[1:25:41] out and show what it proves. It all goes
[1:25:44] together. That's what I was saying. He
[1:25:45] desired to study it in depth but didn't
[1:25:48] do that. We can. We've got the time.
[1:25:51] Parag 3. Uh now that's the next quote.
[1:25:54] Now first you must have faith. Faith
[1:25:56] alone won't do it. Peter said add virtue
[1:25:59] to your faith. So you must have virtue
[1:26:01] in order to add it to your faith.
[1:26:04] This there's this that's why I said
[1:26:05] there's a mystery in how it is put
[1:26:07] together. How do you add virtue to your
[1:26:10] faith?
[1:26:12] Everyone says it add to your faith
[1:26:14] virtue. Add to your virtue knowledge.
[1:26:16] Add to your knowledge temperance and
[1:26:19] patience. But how do you add virtue to
[1:26:21] faith? Therein is a mystery.
[1:26:25] So it might be the reason you don't have
[1:26:27] it because many churches of today teach
[1:26:29] you you don't have to have it or the
[1:26:32] days of it is passed. They don't have to
[1:26:34] have it. One thing you have to do is
[1:26:36] just join the church. Yeah. Days are
[1:26:38] passed. Virtue. Anyone knows what the
[1:26:40] word virtue means. We must have it. If
[1:26:44] virtue went from him to heal the woman
[1:26:46] that was sick, he's expecting the same
[1:26:48] virtue in his church because he was our
[1:26:51] example, the stature of a perfect man.
[1:26:54] If he had a virtue to give to people, he
[1:26:57] expects us to have virtue to give to the
[1:26:59] people. What is virtue? Virtue is
[1:27:03] strength, power. Some of them don't even
[1:27:07] believe in power of God. That's passed.
[1:27:10] One only thing you have to do is put
[1:27:12] your name on the book. That means
[1:27:13] registered to a church, be sprinkled or
[1:27:16] poured or baptized or whatever. That's
[1:27:17] all you have to do. Okay. In the
[1:27:20] scriptures which was first written in in
[1:27:23] uh coined Greek at the time the word for
[1:27:25] virtue is dunamis. Dunamis means power,
[1:27:29] might or strength. So seven virtues
[1:27:36] means power or strengths.
[1:27:41] Seven strengths.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Right? Obviously these are not the
[1:27:46] strengths of the body but of the spirit.
[1:27:49] The strengths are far superior to the
[1:27:51] strength of the body. So that's what I
[1:27:52] want to show you very quickly. We've
[1:27:54] often heard the spirit is willing, but
[1:27:57] the flesh is weak.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; It's in the Bible. It it can heal, mend,
[1:28:03] push the body beyond what you think your
[1:28:06] limit is. That's strengths of the
[1:28:08] spirit. It imagine a church with all
[1:28:11] these virtues or strengths in place. You
[1:28:14] would be invincible.
[1:28:16] You would be immeas you would have
[1:28:18] immeasurable strength
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; right of character. So God felt it
[1:28:23] necessary that we have these seven
[1:28:25] strengths before we could receive the
[1:28:28] most important one. Glory to God. Look
[1:28:32] at the meaning. We understand that
[1:28:34] strengths are not here for a show. When
[1:28:37] you look at the meaning, they are there
[1:28:40] to make you do something.
[1:28:42] So you're not just receiving abilities
[1:28:44] or strengths or power just to walk
[1:28:47] around and say, "Look, I'm a Christian.
[1:28:49] This is my moral character. Look how
[1:28:51] good I am." You no, you you receive
[1:28:54] abilities and strength to do something
[1:28:56] with it.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Got it? So when you speak about
[1:28:59] someone's strength, you are looking at
[1:29:01] their ability to do something. In the
[1:29:04] scripture, let's go very quickly. There
[1:29:06] are times when the word strength is used
[1:29:08] to mean virtue or ability. Acts 9:22,
[1:29:12] but Saul increased the more in strength
[1:29:15] and confounded the Jews which dwelt at
[1:29:17] Damascus, proving that this is the very
[1:29:19] Christ.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; What? He didn't get muscular strength.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; He had he increased in strength and
[1:29:27] confounded the Jews, proving that this
[1:29:30] was Christ
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; in him.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; What strength was it that Paul had,
[1:29:36] right? his uh ability to see the word,
[1:29:41] the revelation of the word made him
[1:29:44] confound the Jews could not even argue
[1:29:46] against him. Remember, he was a Pharisee
[1:29:48] himself. They couldn't argue against him
[1:29:51] because his strength in the word, his
[1:29:54] ability, his power overcame them. How
[1:29:57] about Hebrews 11:11?
[1:30:00] Sarah herself received strength to
[1:30:03] conceive seed. What strength? She was
[1:30:07] barren.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; The strength her body and womb was
[1:30:11] strengthened,
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; healed
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; to produce a child. Romans 5:6. But when
[1:30:18] we were yet without strength, in due
[1:30:21] time Christ died for the ungodly. That's
[1:30:24] literally telling us before Christ came,
[1:30:26] we were without strength. We without
[1:30:28] moral character. We were without virtue
[1:30:32] that was necessary. 2 Corinthians 12:9,
[1:30:35] he said, "My grace is sufficient for
[1:30:37] thee, for my strength is made perfect in
[1:30:40] weakness."
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; His virtues, his abilities are made
[1:30:44] perfect when I show weakness. Really? So
[1:30:48] that is when I am when it says when I am
[1:30:51] at my weakest, when I cannot put on a
[1:30:54] show of natural ability is when the
[1:30:57] virtues of Christ are shown. Which is
[1:31:00] why when you see ma major Christian
[1:31:02] churches today, when you have a preacher
[1:31:05] who walks around shouting, screaming,
[1:31:08] and using charisma, he's using his own
[1:31:10] ability to convince people.
[1:31:14] When you show ability, the glory doesn't
[1:31:17] go to Christ. It goes to the man.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; This is the difference. When you show
[1:31:23] humility,
[1:31:25] that is perfect weakness. and in perfect
[1:31:28] weakness his strength is shown. So when
[1:31:31] a man does not behave more than he is
[1:31:33] and he remains humble and yet speaks the
[1:31:36] word of Christ the glory of the word
[1:31:38] will go to Christ and not the man.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; That is my strength is shown in perfect
[1:31:45] weakness.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; So as long as I am strong personally the
[1:31:51] glory goes to me. Making myself weak
[1:31:54] means submitting myself to his nature.
[1:31:57] Humility. Amen. Saints, do you
[1:31:59] understand what strengths are? We're
[1:32:01] going to get more into that when the
[1:32:03] time comes. So these building materials,
[1:32:06] let's read Revelations 3:8. These
[1:32:08] virtues, remember he said they are
[1:32:10] building materials. I'm almost done.
[1:32:11] We're closing. Every age had trials and
[1:32:14] tests and brought these virtues out of
[1:32:16] people. Now notice what he says to the
[1:32:18] church age of Philadelphia.
[1:32:20] Verse 8. I know thy works. Behold, I set
[1:32:23] before thee an open door. That's what
[1:32:24] Philadelphia means, an open door. And no
[1:32:27] man can shut it. For thou hast a little
[1:32:30] strength
[1:32:31] and has kept my word and has not denied
[1:32:34] my name. In that place, the word here
[1:32:37] for strength is dunamis again, which
[1:32:40] means the same as virtue. When he's the
[1:32:43] word little means a certain or
[1:32:46] particular virtue.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Yes. He's not saying you have very
[1:32:50] little. He's saying you have a little
[1:32:52] virtue. It means you have a certain
[1:32:54] virtue,
[1:32:56] right? You have a particular virtue. Uh
[1:32:59] so it was in every age. Every age had a
[1:33:01] particular virtue, right? As the last
[1:33:04] age ended, a new one began. The first
[1:33:08] thing that happened is that God allowed
[1:33:10] the spirit of the enemy to come into the
[1:33:12] church that re that remained so that he
[1:33:16] could allow the people the experience.
[1:33:18] Remember at the end he says at the end
[1:33:20] of every age he says to him that
[1:33:22] overcomemeth
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; which means there was a spirit that you
[1:33:26] needed to overcome.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; So there needed to be something that the
[1:33:29] virtue needed to act against.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; There needed to be something that the
[1:33:33] strength needed to be proven with.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Right? So he allowed the enemy in so the
[1:33:38] church could experience the adversity so
[1:33:41] the virtue could find the victory.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. As so just when it seemed
[1:33:48] like all was lost in the in the age
[1:33:50] where the enemy spirit came in, messed
[1:33:52] it up, broke the church up, did bad
[1:33:55] things, then comes another messenger and
[1:33:58] God brings a new virtue in to overcome
[1:34:00] that one. Do you see it? So he would
[1:34:03] bring the word, the messenger would
[1:34:04] bring the word to the church. the church
[1:34:06] would receive the correct virtue for
[1:34:07] that age to overcome the invading spirit
[1:34:10] thus building up the church. So it was
[1:34:13] important however to bring out each
[1:34:16] virtue in those ages so that the
[1:34:18] maturity of the church would be at its
[1:34:20] fullness to receive the virtue of God
[1:34:22] himself which is divine love. Last quote
[1:34:26] as we close from the message blasphemous
[1:34:29] names
[1:34:31] page 40 paragraph 3. Then when we have
[1:34:34] these qualifications
[1:34:36] and become full of the virtues of God
[1:34:38] and the things of God, then the Holy
[1:34:41] Spirit comes down and seals us into the
[1:34:44] kingdom. Don't worry now. Everybody will
[1:34:47] know you got it. I love this. You won't
[1:34:51] have to say, "Well, glory to God. I know
[1:34:53] I got it. I spoke with tongues. Glory to
[1:34:55] God. I know I got it. I danced in the
[1:34:57] spirit once." You don't have to say a
[1:34:59] word about it. Everybody will know you
[1:35:02] got it. Don't you worry. It'll testify
[1:35:05] for itself. He'll let it be known among
[1:35:09] men.
[1:35:10] You don't have to brag about it. You
[1:35:13] don't have to shout about it. You don't
[1:35:14] have to go and testify about it. They
[1:35:17] will know in there, in that man, in that
[1:35:21] woman, in that brother, in that sister,
[1:35:23] in that child, in that teenager, in that
[1:35:25] old person, there lies the divine nature
[1:35:27] of God. It will speak for itself. You
[1:35:31] don't have to manufacture it. It will
[1:35:34] speak for itself. Why? If you've met
[1:35:37] with these qualific qualifications, you
[1:35:39] become full of the virtues of God and
[1:35:41] the things of God. The Holy Spirit seals
[1:35:43] it.
[1:35:45] Amen. Seals it. Puts a stamp of approval
[1:35:49] on it. Locks it all in. Makes it
[1:35:52] manifest itself. Amen.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; So saints, when you have the virtue, the
[1:35:55] strength, the power for your age, look
[1:35:58] at the the virtue that's required for
[1:36:00] our age is is divine love itself. The
[1:36:02] capstone that's that's the last thing.
[1:36:05] That's where we are right now.
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That strength. Do we even
[1:36:11] understand? We we have people in the
[1:36:13] message who are going to argue about the
[1:36:16] seventh seal being opened, whether the
[1:36:18] capstone has come down yet or not.
[1:36:21] What is the virtue of your age?
[1:36:25] What are you overcoming in this age?
[1:36:28] What is the virtue required to overcome?
[1:36:30] If you just look around you at the
[1:36:32] condition of churches, the condition of
[1:36:34] the message churches and ask yourself,
[1:36:37] what is it you are supposed to be
[1:36:39] overcoming? What virtue is supposed to
[1:36:42] be on display right now? What does
[1:36:44] charity, what does the capstone actually
[1:36:46] mean?
[1:36:48] Why should we not be talking about this?
[1:36:51] Amen.
[1:36:53] Saints, the strength and ability that
[1:36:55] people gained from the messenger's word
[1:36:58] was unmistakable in every age. History
[1:37:02] recorded it. The people saw it. The
[1:37:05] enemy or the devil. Enemy Satan means
[1:37:08] adversary. Satan is not the name of the
[1:37:11] devil. Christians just made it. Satan is
[1:37:15] is a is a Chaldian word shan which means
[1:37:18] adversary or enemy. Devil is a liar.
[1:37:23] So your adversary is Satan.
[1:37:28] Most of your adversary comes from
[1:37:30] yourself.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Liar. Devil means liar in the Bible.
[1:37:34] False accuser. It's a it's a false it's
[1:37:37] something against the truth. Yeah.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; So people must be able to see what the
[1:37:42] adversary is,
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; what the lie is.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Then you can identify also what virtue
[1:37:49] it's going to take to combat that.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So in conclusion, the
[1:37:55] seven virtues are seven strengths or
[1:37:58] abilities that man once possessed in the
[1:38:01] Garden of Eden. Man once had it, saints,
[1:38:04] and we had dominion over all things. And
[1:38:07] then we lost that in Eden. The woman
[1:38:10] fell in the absence of her capstone.
[1:38:14] The first thing that caused the fall was
[1:38:17] the absence of the capstone. So love was
[1:38:20] lost first.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; That produced the adultery.
[1:38:25] So as a church, we are only safe and
[1:38:28] ready to completely destroy the enemy in
[1:38:32] the presence of our husband. We cannot
[1:38:35] defeat the enemy today if our husband is
[1:38:37] not here.
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; If our capstone is not here. That's the
[1:38:41] whole purpose of being the bride in the
[1:38:42] capstone age is he is here and we have
[1:38:45] the answer to the devil's question as
[1:38:47] compared with Eve who did not.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; As a church we can only fulfill this if
[1:38:53] he is here. If that seventh seal is
[1:38:56] open, when he is present, then the
[1:38:59] virtue of God himself
[1:39:02] in us, divine agape love has descended
[1:39:06] upon all the divine nature of man that
[1:39:09] has been restored to us.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Only this virtue will cause us to
[1:39:14] overcome in this last age. This last age
[1:39:16] is not even enough to have faith,
[1:39:18] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:39:19] godliness, brotherly kindness. That's
[1:39:21] why and that's not even the seven
[1:39:22] thunders. Amen.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; It's not enough to have that. You've got
[1:39:26] to have charity.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; These are our seven steps to perfection.
[1:39:31] There are people in the message in
[1:39:33] closing who use quotes from the message
[1:39:35] to say that we are being restored back
[1:39:38] to the apostolic faith. I know that
[1:39:40] because the prophet said so going back
[1:39:42] to the apostolic
[1:39:44] and they see the apostolic faith as the
[1:39:46] fullness of it. They believe that the
[1:39:48] disciples of Acts chapter 2 had the
[1:39:51] fullness that they had all seven virtues
[1:39:54] that they had the fullness of the word
[1:39:55] because they had Christ with them and
[1:39:57] and then they had Acts chapter 2 the
[1:39:59] Holy Ghost came down and sealed them.
[1:40:01] Then why did they fall?
[1:40:03] Why did the church fall?
[1:40:06] They believe it was a perfect church, a
[1:40:09] perfect tree and then it was broken down
[1:40:11] by those four uh creatures or worms
[1:40:14] symbolically right of Joel uh the
[1:40:17] cankerworm, the palmer worm and so on
[1:40:19] the locust and they believe then it was
[1:40:21] restored through Luther Wesley and
[1:40:23] Pentecost. Now these are things the
[1:40:24] prophet taught and it sounds so good in
[1:40:28] theory but it's not true in reality. I
[1:40:31] believe they missed the underlying
[1:40:33] thing. Whenever you go and read the
[1:40:34] course where he says we are being
[1:40:35] restored back to the apostolic age, he
[1:40:37] was talking about his own ministry.
[1:40:41] They were not recognizing that he was
[1:40:43] talking about himself. Right? Um they
[1:40:47] failed to see that in every quote he was
[1:40:49] talking about his own ministry in faith
[1:40:51] signs and wonders sifting out false
[1:40:54] doctrines exposing lies was in his own
[1:40:56] time in the Pentecostal age bringing us
[1:40:59] back to the the full apostolic
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; that still was lacking something.
[1:41:05] If that church in Paul's day and the
[1:41:09] disciples day was perfect and they had
[1:41:11] all the virtues, why could they not
[1:41:14] understand Paul?
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Why could they not receive Paul's
[1:41:18] message? Why did Peter say the things
[1:41:20] Paul's teaches are is very hard for us?
[1:41:22] We wrestle with it.
[1:41:26] Peter preached the virtues, it seems,
[1:41:28] and yet it's hard to understand. Paul.
[1:41:32] The simple answer to all of these is
[1:41:34] that the fullness of the Amorites
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; had not yet come.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; In the first church age, all the false
[1:41:43] natures of man had not even yet been
[1:41:46] exposed.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; They had not even been through a white
[1:41:49] horse rider, red horse rider, pale
[1:41:50] horse, black horse. They hadn't been
[1:41:52] through that. So, how could they have
[1:41:54] the fullness when all that hadn't been
[1:41:55] exposed yet
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; and then all the seals to be revealed?
[1:41:59] They could not have it.
[1:42:02] with what they had, they would not have
[1:42:04] been victorious.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; God had purposed this for the bride at
[1:42:09] the end.
[1:42:10] I mean, right there in the first age,
[1:42:12] they already started dividing.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Peter and James, Paul and Barnabas,
[1:42:19] and they they basically separated, went
[1:42:22] off their different ways. The church
[1:42:24] already started with with u dividing.
[1:42:28] They they agreed on the baptism of the
[1:42:30] Holy Ghost and what a baptism God had in
[1:42:32] some things but they were not agreed on
[1:42:34] many other things.
[1:42:36] If they had the fullness, why were they
[1:42:40] not in agreement? Why were they not the
[1:42:42] perfect church? Having the signs,
[1:42:44] wonders, miracles, healings is not the
[1:42:47] perfect church. Amen.
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; So God had purposed this for the bride
[1:42:52] at the end and we are living in that day
[1:42:55] that all the virtues must be complete
[1:42:57] and sealed in for the capstone to
[1:43:00] descend upon us. Praise be to God. Let's
[1:43:03] bow our heads together.
