[0:00] Good morning, saints, and I greet you
[0:02] all in the precious name of the Lord and
[0:03] Savior Jesus Christ. It's wonderful to
[0:06] be sharing the word of the Lord with you
[0:07] once again.
[0:09] So, we're dealing with the throne of
[0:12] God, part five. Uh that's our series and
[0:17] we're dealing with the most holy place
[0:20] and this is part three. And today we're
[0:22] going to look at the veil of the
[0:25] covering.
[0:26] We'll start our scripture reading from
[0:28] Exodus 26 and verse 31-33.
[0:35] And thou shalt make a veil of blue and
[0:36] purple and scarlet and fine twine linen
[0:39] of cunning work with cherubams shall it
[0:41] be made. And thou shalt hang it upon
[0:43] four pillars of chhatim wood overlaid
[0:46] with gold. Their hooks shall be of gold
[0:48] upon the four sockets of silver. And
[0:51] thou shalt hang up the veil under the
[0:52] tashes, that thou mayest bring in
[0:55] thither within the veil the ark of the
[0:57] testimony, and the veil shall divide
[1:00] unto you between the holy place and the
[1:04] most holy. The veil shall divide unto
[1:08] you between the holy place and the most
[1:11] holy.
[1:13] The Lord added blessing to his word. So
[1:15] today we look at the veil that separated
[1:18] the inner court from the most holy place
[1:21] taken from this scripture.
[1:24] That's the most amazing clue about this
[1:27] veil that we find here in the scripture.
[1:30] So this veil that separates the inner
[1:33] court from the most holy place or as you
[1:36] can see as the Bible said the holy place
[1:38] which is the inner court and the most
[1:40] holy which is the most holy place.
[1:43] So this veil
[1:46] is also known as the veil of the
[1:49] covering
[1:50] in the Bible and as brother Brandham
[1:53] called it the inner veil.
[1:56] So what was the veil? What was its
[2:00] purpose? Why was it necessary?
[2:03] How did it come to be?
[2:06] These are the questions we must an
[2:08] answer among many others. So just for
[2:11] your information, especially for the
[2:13] young people of the modern generation,
[2:16] in the Bible, they used the old spelling
[2:19] V A I L. But today, it is spelled
[2:24] V E I L. Today, those two words have
[2:28] different meanings. But in the time of
[2:30] the old English, they were the same.
[2:33] Today,
[2:35] veil spelled with an a is seen as an
[2:38] oldenday verb which means to be or to
[2:42] lower one's hat or crown or or crown in
[2:45] respect of a dignitary
[2:48] or some royalty or it simply means to
[2:52] submit to authority.
[2:55] Veil V E I L on the other hand is the
[2:59] modernday spelling that means a covering
[3:03] or fabric
[3:06] or a membrane in biology.
[3:09] So just remember that when you read the
[3:11] Bible uh don't be confused when you read
[3:14] in the Old Testament and you see the
[3:16] spelling as V A I L. Just remember it is
[3:20] the same uh as the same meaning as V E I
[3:24] L that we use today. Okay. So I want to
[3:27] begin by uh looking at a diagram.
[3:30] Obviously we if we're
[3:32] um in church in front of a whiteboard or
[3:36] or blackboard I could be drawing this
[3:39] diagram for you. So I provided a drawing
[3:42] on or a diagram in the notes and um so
[3:46] please follow that. So there are three
[3:47] diagrams. The first one is u I want to
[3:51] show the dividing between the holy place
[3:53] and the most holy. That's very simple
[3:55] diagram without the furniture of the
[3:57] tabernacle.
[3:59] So it's if you look at the first
[4:00] diagram, it is um the outer rectangle or
[4:05] the outer court. And then you see I've
[4:08] got in thick black another rectangle
[4:11] within which is one building.
[4:16] And you'll see the veil of the covering
[4:18] separates
[4:20] two rooms. The veil of the covering
[4:23] creates two rooms out of this one
[4:26] building. Okay? So, so you have the most
[4:29] holy place and the inner court, but
[4:33] those two rooms are created by this veil
[4:36] of the covering. So, focus on the most
[4:39] holy place and the inner court.
[4:42] Notice that these two places are
[4:44] structurally of the same makeup. What am
[4:48] I saying? Do you notice something
[4:51] interesting?
[4:52] The most holy place and the inner court
[4:56] are basically one building. They are
[4:59] just separated by the veil.
[5:03] So in fact without the veil there would
[5:06] be no most holy.
[5:09] it would be one big holy place or one
[5:14] big inner court. Right?
[5:18] So bear this in mind because this is
[5:20] very important for us to notice in the
[5:23] um later part of this teaching.
[5:27] Now I want you to use the same diagram
[5:31] and focus on the same
[5:34] um building but let's look at this as if
[5:38] it is the tabernacle of heaven right so
[5:42] let's assume well taking from the
[5:45] scriptures heaven is my throne earth is
[5:47] my foottool so throne meaning inner
[5:50] court and earth meaning out court right
[5:54] let's just take it in that um example
[5:58] now we know in terms of dimensions earth
[6:00] is uh dimensions 1 2 and three and
[6:04] heaven is um dimensions six and seven so
[6:08] I've got there in the diagram
[6:11] um the inner court there is made up of
[6:14] dimensions six and seven and you see a
[6:16] veil of the covering separating the
[6:19] sixth dimension and the seventh
[6:20] dimension now remember these are just
[6:23] symbolic diagrams but I want to explain
[6:25] something Here when you study the
[6:27] dimensions we see that heaven is
[6:29] comprised of the sixth and the seventh
[6:31] dimension. Those of you who don't know
[6:33] brother Brandham said seventh dimension
[6:35] is the word is God. The seventh
[6:38] dimension heaven consists of the word.
[6:41] They are both heaven. Seventh dimension
[6:43] and sixth dimension are both heaven. But
[6:46] something divides it in the realm of
[6:48] angels
[6:50] and the realm of the word of God itself.
[6:52] something divides makes a division
[6:54] between God himself or the word the
[6:58] dimension of the word and the dimension
[7:00] of angels and the dead in Christ or the
[7:05] saints.
[7:07] So remember the prophet's vision of
[7:08] beyond the curtain of time when he met
[7:10] all the saints he asked to see Jesus and
[7:14] what did they say to him they said you
[7:16] cannot he is a little higher I explained
[7:19] this before this doesn't mean there's a
[7:22] a you know a higher story or a second
[7:25] story in heaven like like a house what
[7:28] do they mean by a little higher now
[7:31] obviously
[7:32] um
[7:34] for those people who think connally and
[7:36] think that heaven is off in the universe
[7:39] somewhere. It's uh in the stars,
[7:42] literally in the stars. Uh once you get
[7:45] out into the universe and if you go out
[7:48] into the galaxies,
[7:50] you can't say a thing like a little
[7:52] higher
[7:54] because there is no up or down in the
[7:57] universe.
[8:00] Do you do you understand that there is
[8:01] no up or down? You cannot tell which is
[8:03] up which is down. So that statement
[8:07] would not make sense in a literal or
[8:10] carnal context.
[8:12] So when when they say he's a little
[8:15] higher, they're referring to uh
[8:19] spiritually
[8:20] uh in terms of um a more
[8:25] godlike dimension, a more uh um a holier
[8:30] dimension.
[8:32] Right? So if we could describe it in
[8:35] that way, of course I would I would use
[8:36] it use different descriptive words to to
[8:39] to make that known or to explain that.
[8:44] But in terms of you know when when the
[8:46] prophet speaks of the dimensions he
[8:49] speaks of uh starting at earth at at
[8:52] dimension 1 2 and three and he said as
[8:53] you go up you've got the sixth dimension
[8:57] and the seventh dimension and he
[8:58] explains that and he said from there
[9:00] going from now from earth going down
[9:02] you've got the fifth dimension which is
[9:04] divided into three and you know and so
[9:06] forth a region of the the lost region of
[9:10] uh devils and then Satan himself. So he
[9:13] talks about going up and going down.
[9:15] Obviously not physically
[9:17] but he was referring to spirituality.
[9:21] So if you have to go higher in terms of
[9:24] holiness
[9:26] in terms of um the the nature the divine
[9:29] nature you're going to end at the
[9:33] seventh dimension which is the highest
[9:35] existence of divine nature. So going
[9:38] downwards would mean opposite to
[9:41] holiness that would mean going downward
[9:45] seeping deeper into sinful nature and
[9:49] that would be uh regions of the lost
[9:52] regions of demons and then Satan himself
[9:54] the father of all lies. All right. So
[9:56] just explaining that uh the dimensions.
[10:00] So remember the prophet's vision of of
[10:03] beyond the curtain of time. So there was
[10:04] an existence
[10:06] when these two dimensions were actually
[10:09] one dimension. So what I'm saying is
[10:12] there was a there was an existence where
[10:15] seventh and sixth dimension were one
[10:17] dimension. So they were not sixth and
[10:19] seventh. Right? This was before the
[10:22] earth was um u
[10:26] uh refurbished. So we had this sixth uh
[10:30] we had this dimension where God dwelt
[10:33] freely or existed freely amongst the
[10:37] angels. But the separation came when
[10:41] some of the angels were deceived by
[10:43] Lucifer,
[10:45] right? And that's when that existence
[10:48] changed and God began to make man.
[10:51] angels lost their original place and
[10:55] became just messengers and not um the
[11:00] race that God existed with.
[11:03] So what we see here is that at one time
[11:09] those two dimensions were actually one
[11:13] and the veil brought a separation
[11:16] right for a purpose. The veil brought a
[11:20] separation. Right? Now let's go to the
[11:23] tabernacle of man. Let's look at the
[11:25] same diagram and look at the tabernacle
[11:27] of man. Now you know outwardly we are
[11:29] body moving inward we are spirit and
[11:32] then the very deepest part of us is the
[11:34] soul.
[11:36] Now looking at it the same way what
[11:39] we'll notice is that the spirit and soul
[11:43] are basically one building. Well it
[11:46] should be. So you know brother Vanom
[11:50] says that the soul is the nature of the
[11:53] spirit right now if you think carefully
[11:57] about it soul and spirit are actually
[12:00] both spirit world they're both conceive
[12:04] spiritual things so the makeup is
[12:07] similar to Moses tabernacle one large
[12:11] room or spiritual dimension
[12:15] but then divided by a veil
[12:18] taken from our scripture, the veil shall
[12:20] divide unto you the most holy and the
[12:23] holy place. So, um, one large room, if
[12:28] we could put it that way, or dimension,
[12:31] divided by a veil to create a secret
[12:34] place.
[12:36] That's what that veil essentially did.
[12:38] It created a secret place within the
[12:40] spiritual dimension.
[12:43] So, but what if that veil were to be
[12:46] taken away today? That's the beautiful
[12:48] thing that we need to look at in this
[12:50] teaching. What if that veil across the
[12:54] soul was taken away? Then the glory of
[12:56] the Lord would fill the entire spirit
[12:59] realm and it would not be hidden
[13:03] but felt by the believer. See, right
[13:05] now, let me let me put it to you
[13:07] plainly. Right now, you you under the
[13:09] third pole ministry. You are receiving
[13:11] the word. The word in revelation in the
[13:14] soul realm. But because a veil still
[13:17] exists,
[13:19] a separation between soul and spirit
[13:21] still exists.
[13:23] It is not always felt that the shakina
[13:26] glory fills your spirit. Now remember
[13:30] part of your spirit is your mind. So we
[13:33] know that in this life our mind and our
[13:35] soul is constantly at war with each
[13:37] other. Right? We know that from greatest
[13:39] battle ever fought. But if there was no
[13:42] veil,
[13:44] even our minds would be filled with the
[13:46] shakina glory of God. The the glory
[13:49] would fill
[13:51] uh the entire inner tabernacle, the the
[13:55] entire inner court and would be felt
[13:57] even out into the body realm. Right? So
[14:01] let's let's use that as an introduction
[14:04] and let's go to uh a few scriptures in
[14:07] in the book of Exodus chapter 40 and one
[14:09] in Numbers 4 and let's look at this veil
[14:11] of the covering.
[14:13] Exodus 40:3. And thou shalt put therein
[14:16] the ark of the testimony and cover the
[14:19] ark with the veil. Okay, cover the ark
[14:23] with the veil. Uh verse 21.
[14:28] And he brought the ark into the
[14:30] tabernacle and set up the veil of the
[14:32] covering and covered the ark of the
[14:35] testimony as the Lord commanded Moses.
[14:40] Numbers 4:5 and when the camp setth
[14:43] forward when that means when the people
[14:45] begin to move, Aaron shall come and his
[14:48] sons and they shall take down the
[14:51] covering veil and cover the ark of
[14:54] testimony with it. All right. So here is
[14:57] another purpose for the veil. Besides
[15:00] being a separation between two or
[15:04] separation in the inner court to create
[15:06] a secret place, here's another purpose
[15:09] for the veil. It was meant to cover the
[15:11] ark of the testimony or the throne of
[15:14] God to protect those on the outside from
[15:17] certain death. All right? So let's bear
[15:20] this in mind. This the purpose of this
[15:22] veil is not to protect the inside. It's
[15:24] to protect the outside.
[15:27] You know a lot of people don't realize
[15:28] that because if that outside is exposed
[15:31] to the shikina glory that outside being
[15:34] not sanctified being not uh completely
[15:37] perfect could be destroyed by this
[15:40] shakina glory. So when the ark was in
[15:43] transit that means the people of Israel
[15:45] picked up from wherever they were in the
[15:47] wilderness and began to move further now
[15:49] in their journey.
[15:51] Uh while the tabernacle was being set up
[15:54] or taken down, the veil of badger skins
[15:57] and blue and purple had to cover the ark
[16:00] for the protection of the people.
[16:03] The veil was made heavy and difficult to
[16:07] put up and take down. It took several
[16:09] men to put that veil up and to take it
[16:12] down. Was heavy thick veil.
[16:16] It symbolized now we need to see this
[16:18] this symbol. It symbolized how strong
[16:21] the covering, how strong the veil had to
[16:24] be and how significant that division had
[16:26] to be. This wasn't some flimsy drywall
[16:30] that you stuck between or inside this
[16:33] inner court. This was a heavy thick
[16:36] veil.
[16:38] And you know with with some of the
[16:40] things that we have today, some fabrics,
[16:43] uh things could penetrate through there.
[16:45] light could penetrate through some of
[16:48] the the fabrics and things we have. Not
[16:50] so with this veil. This veil was a thick
[16:54] impenetrable
[16:56] material made of uh of bad skins and um
[17:01] painted with scarlet and purple and
[17:04] embroidered with cherubams in there,
[17:07] right? But being heavy and difficult to
[17:11] put up and take down, it was a strong
[17:15] division, a and a strong covering for
[17:18] the ark. But this was not meant to be a
[17:20] permanent thing. God did not always want
[17:23] to be so distanced from his people.
[17:26] Remember, God's original desire was to
[17:28] be to exist with his people. So the only
[17:32] reason for this veil was to protect the
[17:34] people because they were not ready for
[17:36] his existence with them. Right? So as
[17:40] time went on, the Israelites became
[17:42] complacent in this religion
[17:45] uh that came through Moses and that veil
[17:48] became something that protected them
[17:50] from God. And they were satisfied with
[17:52] this arrangement. Very satisfied. It
[17:54] showed when they refused to hear God
[17:56] speak from the mountain because he was
[17:58] too frightening. So they asked Moses to
[18:01] bring the word of God to them instead of
[18:04] God speaking directly to them. Now
[18:07] remember, brother Baram says that was
[18:08] the biggest problem. That was their
[18:10] biggest mistake. But when Moses went
[18:13] into the presence of God, the glory of
[18:16] God filled Moses' being and Moses' face
[18:20] began to shine with the glory of God.
[18:22] And then he came out to speak to the
[18:24] people and the people were afraid again.
[18:26] And then they made him put a veil now
[18:28] over his face
[18:31] uh to veil that glory away from him from
[18:34] them. So you see even again when a man
[18:37] comes out and he becomes the presence of
[18:39] God speaking to the people they don't
[18:42] want to behold that glory. So they veil
[18:44] the man's face.
[18:46] So Moses had to wear a veil when he came
[18:49] out from the presence of God to speak
[18:51] the word.
[18:53] The problem began that as long as that
[18:55] veil was still there, now this is
[18:57] biblical, the believer could get no
[19:00] closer than the inner court. Now, we
[19:05] could feel sheltered and even free
[19:07] having this convenience of God being
[19:10] veiled away from us. We could feel
[19:12] sheltered, even free to live life as we
[19:14] please, knowing that we are safe. We are
[19:18] safe as long as God remains separate
[19:22] in his existence in his most holy place.
[19:26] This kind of lifestyle led man into
[19:28] sinfulness and unrighteousness
[19:31] because obviously man was not meant to
[19:33] live or exist separate from God.
[19:38] God's desire was to exist with man. So
[19:42] when you leave man separated from the
[19:45] existence of God from existing with God
[19:51] then sin and unrighteousness eventually
[19:54] comes in. Now that veil simply had to be
[19:57] done away with. Amen. So I want us to
[20:00] have a look at what the purpose of
[20:03] Christ's coming was the first coming.
[20:07] All right there. Now, we can preach the
[20:09] the purpose of the coming of Christ for
[20:11] many different reasons. A lot of people
[20:12] do not realize this reason.
[20:17] Mark 15:37.
[20:20] And Jesus cried with a loud voice and
[20:22] gave up the ghost. So, obviously this is
[20:23] Calvary. He's he has just died. Cried
[20:27] with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.
[20:30] Verse 38. And the veil of the temple was
[20:33] rent in twain. That mean it was torn in
[20:36] two pieces from top to from the from the
[20:39] top to the bottom.
[20:42] Verse 39. And when the centurion which
[20:44] stood over against him, the centurion
[20:46] the Roman centurion who stood next to
[20:49] Christ saw that he so cried out that
[20:53] means in throws of death and that he
[20:56] gave up the ghost that means he died.
[20:58] And the centurion said, "Truly, this man
[21:01] was the son of God." Amen. Now, Christ's
[21:07] mystery purpose was to remove that veil
[21:11] that separated God from his people.
[21:15] Amen. We got to see the saints. If the
[21:19] people weren't going to be able to do it
[21:22] themselves, that is to remove the veil
[21:24] between them and God. If a man was not
[21:28] able to remove the veil between his soul
[21:31] and his spirit, God had to become man to
[21:35] do it for man.
[21:38] It was God who desired it. Saints, he
[21:41] did it through Christ because no one
[21:43] else was able to do it. People were
[21:46] unable and afraid till they absolutely
[21:49] felt they were not permitted to be any
[21:51] closer to God.
[21:54] Notice something that the centurion was
[21:57] able to speak by revelation
[22:00] that he truly was the son of God only
[22:04] after the veil was rent in the temple.
[22:08] Did you notice that? Even though he
[22:10] didn't know the veil was rent in the
[22:13] temple,
[22:15] but at the moment or after the veil was
[22:18] rent, that's the time revelation poured
[22:21] out. And and this man was able to speak
[22:24] with that revelation and and be assured
[22:26] in his soul that this was the son of God
[22:30] truly. He said the prophet tells us that
[22:33] it was done by God. Tearing the veil was
[22:36] done by God. It was not man who did it.
[22:39] There could have been some historians
[22:40] who came in there and said, "Well, a man
[22:44] did this." But brother Ram explains why
[22:47] it could not be a man.
[22:49] Paragraph 58 of the message. How can I
[22:52] overcome? Brother Ram says, "Now that
[22:55] was the law. The law ended right there
[22:57] because the veil kept the congregation
[22:59] from the holy articles of God. Only an
[23:02] anointed priest went in there and that
[23:05] and that once a year, remember
[23:08] now God with his own hand, notice from
[23:11] the top to the bottom, not from the
[23:13] bottom to the top." Now that's a
[23:14] scripture we read, right? It's some 40
[23:17] ft high. Notice now, not from the bottom
[23:21] to the top, but from the top to the
[23:22] bottom showed it was done by God. Now,
[23:26] for those of you who studied the
[23:28] scripture and know what Solomon
[23:30] Solomon's temple was like and how high
[23:34] that veil was, it was impossible for a
[23:36] man to get up there. And why even at
[23:39] this time when the Pharisees and
[23:41] Sadducees would have wanted to preserve
[23:43] the temple to prove
[23:47] uh that they were right and that Christ
[23:49] was wrong, why would they rent the veil?
[23:52] And we know from history renting the
[23:55] veil showed that there was actually no
[23:58] ark of the covenant behind that veil.
[24:00] that they were they were living a lie
[24:03] because the ark had been missing during
[24:06] the captivity.
[24:08] Uh so the the presence of the lord had
[24:12] gone out and we all know that story. It
[24:14] was it was the the word ikabod that the
[24:17] presence of god is departed.
[24:19] So notice what he says here. Rent the
[24:23] veil in two. Then anyone whosoever will
[24:29] may come and partake of his holiness. So
[24:32] the prophet saying that rending the veil
[24:36] was giving access.
[24:40] There was no more partition filling the
[24:43] glory filling the entire inner court
[24:46] which gave access to the believer to
[24:49] come in there freely and partake of the
[24:52] chakina glory. Now Christ broke down all
[24:56] veils.
[24:57] His purpose was to join the most holy
[25:00] and the holy place and make two
[25:05] two courts into one.
[25:09] Right after his resurrection, he
[25:12] ascended and he continued his purpose.
[25:15] Now according to what he said to the
[25:18] disciples, he was going to prepare a
[25:21] place that where he was we might be
[25:24] also. That means he wanted to share his
[25:28] existence with us. What existence? The
[25:31] existence of eternity. The existence of
[25:34] the seventh dimension. He wanted to
[25:36] share that dimension. So here we live in
[25:38] the dimensions of light, matter and
[25:40] time.
[25:42] We know that in his dimension, the
[25:44] dimension of the existence of God is the
[25:46] seventh dimension. It is eternity. It is
[25:48] eternal life.
[25:51] So we know that in his vision, the
[25:55] saints beyond the curtain of time
[25:58] uh are not yet sharing his existence
[26:02] because the veil of heaven had not been
[26:04] taken down and the word was not yet
[26:05] fully revealed. Remember those people
[26:08] that he met beyond the curtain of time?
[26:10] They had they were though they were in
[26:13] the sixth dimension in heaven they were
[26:15] not yet sharing the existence of Christ.
[26:20] They were sharing the existence of
[26:21] angels.
[26:23] Got it? So he began Christ began by
[26:28] making a way into the seventh dimension.
[26:30] Now now how was the way made? I go to
[26:33] prepare a place for you that where I am
[26:35] you might be also. I am the way, the
[26:38] truth and the life. So how did he make a
[26:40] way for the believer to gain access to
[26:45] the existence of the word, the existence
[26:48] of God, the seventh dimension. That way
[26:52] was begun by the baptism of the Holy
[26:54] Ghost by the Holy Ghost himself.
[26:58] He Christ was the way to the father.
[27:04] In other words, he was the way, the
[27:06] word, the seventh dimension was the way
[27:10] to exist eternally. The father
[27:12] symbolizes eternal life, right? The
[27:16] progenitor of all things, of all that is
[27:20] eternal. So he said that if we believe
[27:24] Christ said if we believed in him that
[27:27] is the word made flesh we could see the
[27:32] father that is we could experience the
[27:37] existence of God
[27:39] or be reconciled to God. So if we
[27:43] believed in the word revealed by the
[27:46] Holy Spirit to us, we could share the
[27:49] eternal existence of God.
[27:52] So he went to heaven to break away the
[27:56] veil that separated God and man in
[27:59] heavenly places. All right. So I want to
[28:03] read a scripture for you to further
[28:06] express this. Hebrews chapter 6 and
[28:09] verse 19-20.
[28:12] Which hope we have as an anchor of the
[28:14] soul, both sure and steadfast,
[28:19] and which enterth into that within the
[28:22] veil, whether the forerunner is for us
[28:25] entered, even Jesus made an high priest
[28:30] forever after the order of Mechisedc.
[28:35] So this tells us that he went before us
[28:38] to prepare the way for us.
[28:43] All right, there's a lot that can be
[28:45] explained in that little phrase, prepare
[28:48] the way. All right, he had to make it
[28:51] possible. In other words, we are we we
[28:54] are people born in sin or conceived in
[28:58] sin, shapen in iniquity. We come into
[29:01] this world speaking lies.
[29:03] We are
[29:04] We believe in the word
[29:07] to the
[29:09] extent that we believe we will gain
[29:13] eternal life by believing in the word of
[29:15] God and achieve a greater existence than
[29:19] this existence of light matter time.
[29:23] We believe we can achieve a greater
[29:26] existence than the existence of that or
[29:29] the existence that that is ruled by
[29:31] death that all men should die one day.
[29:35] Right? So we believe beyond that
[29:38] existence.
[29:40] So this tells us he went to prepare a
[29:43] way for us to enter into a new
[29:47] existence. the existence of God and not
[29:51] the normal existence of man which ends
[29:54] in death.
[29:56] So he went to prepare this way for us
[29:59] that this might become possible. He was
[30:02] the forerunner
[30:04] of this. So for this to happen, we had
[30:09] to accept his sacrifice and we had to
[30:12] see who he was, who Christ was. We had
[30:15] to by faith go beyond his veil of flesh.
[30:19] Meaning we couldn't be like those people
[30:22] dealt with Moses.
[30:25] We had to look into his face. We had to
[30:27] look beyond. Now no symbolically
[30:30] obviously no one has appeared physically
[30:34] to people in this modern world saying I
[30:36] am Jesus Christ. Nobody has seen the
[30:40] physical
[30:41] Jesus Christ of 2,000 years ago.
[30:44] Right?
[30:46] So
[30:49] that flesh however that picture of him
[30:52] has been inbred
[30:55] into us for years for generations from
[31:01] uh long before some churches were formed
[31:04] like Baptist, Methodist, Episcopalian
[31:07] whatever they are. But we all have a
[31:10] preconceived idea of him. We assume him
[31:14] to be well we call him our savior. We
[31:17] paint him as a picture of kindness, his
[31:20] eyes of compassion and him on the cross
[31:23] looking lovingly down at people. And um
[31:28] we we basically um all have different
[31:32] you know conceptions or preconceived
[31:36] ideas and and those dangerous things
[31:39] because
[31:41] we need to be able to go beyond that
[31:44] flesh to see what what was behind there.
[31:47] What was the secret? We needed to see
[31:50] the existence of God in that person.
[31:55] Right? Not that he was a son of God or a
[31:58] second person in the trinity or someone
[32:01] who began the Christian religion or
[32:04] someone great to look up to.
[32:07] He was the most holy veiled by flesh.
[32:12] There was a mystery about him which
[32:14] we're going to come to at the end.
[32:17] And that's what people couldn't
[32:18] understand. He was he looked like a man
[32:21] but why was he not a normal man?
[32:25] There was something different about him,
[32:27] right? His body was the new veil upon
[32:30] earth.
[32:32] And the believer had to believe his word
[32:34] to go beyond that veil in order for the
[32:37] veil to be released in heaven to them.
[32:42] That's the story here. for us to have
[32:45] that veil released in heaven. In other
[32:47] words, for us to have sixth dimension
[32:49] and seventh dimension become one
[32:53] while on earth,
[32:55] we have to see beyond the veil of Jesus
[32:58] Christ who was here 2,000 years ago.
[33:02] Right? We've got to be able to see that
[33:04] he's not just son of God or second
[33:06] person, the Trinity.
[33:09] We have to recognize the very presence
[33:11] of God. And we in this day have to
[33:14] believe that having not even seen him
[33:17] physically 2,000 years ago.
[33:22] Now, we could inherit eternal life as
[33:24] long as we were able to see past his
[33:27] flesh, which people still fail to see
[33:30] past today. If you've ever spoken to
[33:34] Christian churches and the those who
[33:36] believe in the Trinity and have never
[33:38] gotten away from that indoctrination,
[33:41] it's scary. But they can never see past
[33:45] the son of God. They can never see
[33:47] Christ past being the son of God. Let's
[33:51] go to Hebrews 10:19-22.
[33:54] It says, "Having therefore, brethren,
[33:56] boldness to come, a boldness to enter
[34:00] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus
[34:03] by a new and living way which he has
[34:05] consecrated for us through the veil,
[34:08] that is to say, his flesh." Here the
[34:12] Bible is telling us that the veil is the
[34:14] flesh of Christ. Okay? And having an
[34:17] high priest over the house of God, let
[34:20] us draw near with the true heart in full
[34:23] assurance of faith, having our hearts
[34:26] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[34:28] our bodies washed with pure water.
[34:32] So what does this do for us?
[34:36] See something supernatural happens
[34:39] because what this belief what this faith
[34:42] in Christ when we look beyond his veil
[34:45] when we get the revelation of who he is
[34:49] it does something to us it prepares our
[34:52] bodies to become the new veil the his
[34:56] new veil
[34:57] to the world because the whole point is
[35:00] to prep to prepare us to become the new
[35:03] existence of God. See, he sent his word
[35:07] to the church by the messengers, right?
[35:10] And the people were to be were to
[35:12] overcome the the trials of each age by
[35:15] looking beyond the veil of each
[35:18] messenger to see the word for that day.
[35:21] And when they did, the word was able to
[35:24] do something amazing for them.
[35:28] That word was able to do something
[35:31] amazing for them. something that never
[35:35] took place before.
[35:37] Hebrews 4:12,
[35:39] for the word of God is quick and
[35:42] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[35:45] sword. Now watch these words. Piercing
[35:49] even to the dividing aunderder of soul
[35:52] and spirit and of the joints and marrow.
[35:56] And is a discerner of thoughts and
[35:57] intents of the heart.
[36:00] See, Paul spoke of the dividing
[36:02] aunderder of soul and spirit. What is
[36:04] the dividing aunderder of soul and
[36:06] spirit? That's the veil.
[36:09] Okay? So, when you believe the word, the
[36:13] word is able to go right through to
[36:18] where the veil is between your soul and
[36:21] spirit. When you were able to look
[36:24] beyond the veil of the messengers, to
[36:26] look beyond the veil of Christ, when you
[36:28] were able to see the word, to have that
[36:31] revelation, that word penetrates your
[36:35] being and gets right to where the veil
[36:38] is between your soul and your spirit.
[36:43] The question is, what is it in our
[36:46] hearts that separates our soul from our
[36:50] spirit?
[36:53] Revelation chapter 4 part two. This is a
[36:56] message preached in 61st of January. New
[36:59] Year's Day message. Paragraph 272. Watch
[37:03] what brother man is saying then. How do
[37:06] we get into this? Now remember there was
[37:08] a veil. A veil that hangs between the
[37:11] holy and the holiest of holies. In the
[37:14] holiest of holies is where Christ comes
[37:16] to sat down on your heart's throne.
[37:20] Christ is enthroned.
[37:22] He comes through justification. Is that
[37:25] right? Sanctification. Then by water, by
[37:28] one church, by one creed, by one spirit.
[37:31] From here are we all baptized into one
[37:33] body which is the body of Christ. By the
[37:36] what? Holy Spirit. What comes in?
[37:40] Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterian,
[37:42] Pentecostals, whosoever will
[37:45] that veil. You know, you know what that
[37:48] veil is? That veils you veils your heart
[37:51] from it. Are you ready? The b the
[37:54] prophet said the veil is called
[37:56] selfwill.
[37:59] Do you get the picture? Now the senses
[38:02] out here, he's talking about the senses.
[38:04] He says the senses on the body and the
[38:06] senses to the soul.
[38:08] The veil between that holy place, the
[38:11] holiest of holy. And the only way that
[38:14] you can get in there is to have is is to
[38:18] have selfworth. For what? Whosoever
[38:20] what? Whosoever shakes hands. Whosoever
[38:22] is immersed. Whosoever joins the church.
[38:25] Whosoever pass his letter. Whosoever
[38:27] does. No. Whosoever will come beyond the
[38:31] veil.
[38:33] That means whosoever will go beyond his
[38:37] own self-will.
[38:40] See, self-will has always been the thing
[38:43] that kept our belief of God locked away.
[38:49] Okay, so we need to get deeper into
[38:51] this. Our self-will was ruled by the
[38:55] influence of our lives. See, they became
[39:00] hardened veils of tradition and they
[39:02] have to be torn down from top to bottom
[39:05] by the lamb.
[39:08] All right, let's have a look at God's
[39:10] provided way of approach to fellowship.
[39:15] Uh this a message preached in 1960 9th
[39:17] of July. He says on the inside of the
[39:20] holiest of holies. Now one man once a
[39:23] year went in there. But when our real
[39:25] sacrifice Jesus Christ died at Calvary,
[39:28] he rent the veil into making a way with
[39:30] his own blood that whosoever will can
[39:34] come into shakina glory in the presence
[39:36] of the Holy Ghost and be filled with the
[39:38] power of Pentecost as they did after the
[39:41] veil had been tore down. yellow, brown,
[39:43] black, white, male, female, gentile or
[39:45] Jew, whosoever will, let him come and
[39:48] drink from the fountain of life,
[39:50] fountain of the Lord. When they come
[39:51] into that shikina glory, anointed with
[39:54] the Holy Spirit, then they got
[39:55] fellowship with God again. Then they're
[39:59] sons and daughters of God. No wonder we
[40:02] stop at the water of separation and try
[40:04] to fellowship from from here down here.
[40:07] You can't do it. You stop by the side of
[40:10] the blood without entering the holy
[40:12] place, you are still you still are not
[40:14] in fellowship.
[40:16] But when you take all preparations, see,
[40:20] so notice who ever will,
[40:25] you have to pass beyond your own
[40:28] self-will
[40:30] to get into the presence of God.
[40:33] Fellowship with God restored. when you
[40:36] can get beyond your own self-will.
[40:39] Don't stop at the steps of baptism,
[40:41] sanctification, and and baptism of the
[40:44] Holy Ghost.
[40:47] Amen.
[40:49] Let's read unveiling of God.
[40:52] Now, at one time, this is paragraph 117
[40:55] in the message, Unveiling of God. Now,
[40:58] at one time, if a man walked through the
[40:59] veil, it was sudden death. Now, it's
[41:02] death not to go through it. Amen. If you
[41:05] can't break the veil of tradition, break
[41:07] through the wall of denomination to see
[41:09] God in his power, it's death. Once where
[41:12] it was death to go in, now it's death to
[41:15] stay out. The whole mercy seat is
[41:18] setting in plain view. Anybody can see
[41:21] it. The veil is rent. Glory to God. The
[41:24] whole mercy seat comes into plain view.
[41:27] So saints, all is lost for us if the
[41:30] veil between our spirit and our soul,
[41:33] that is our self-will, is not torn away.
[41:37] We've got to come back to the way Adam
[41:39] was at the beginning. His self-will was
[41:42] determined to do the will of God.
[41:44] Unbelief changed that, right? The
[41:48] unveiling of God. Again, paragraph 127.
[41:51] Notice
[41:53] death to stay away from it. Now you must
[41:56] go into it through this veil or you
[41:59] won't. How God could have mercy on them.
[42:01] But remember what it was that God is
[42:03] manifesting. What was behind that veil?
[42:06] Watch what was behind the veil. The
[42:08] word. What did it veil? The word. What
[42:11] was it? It's in the ark. It was the word
[42:15] that that veil hid. And Jesus was that
[42:18] word. He is that word. And the veil of
[42:21] his flesh hid it. And today the veil of
[42:24] tradition hides the word again saying
[42:27] it's not so. But it is so. God is
[42:30] testifying of it blasting it himself
[42:32] right out as bright as the sun before
[42:34] everyone. And they fail to see it. God
[42:37] be merciful to us.
[42:39] See saints our belief in God must
[42:42] stretch beyond the veil of Jesus Christ
[42:45] until we see the word. What are we
[42:47] saying here?
[42:49] You have to even stretch beyond the veil
[42:54] concerning you beyond the veil of flesh.
[42:59] Right? We'll get to that. Now, let's
[43:02] read the unveiling of God, paragraph
[43:03] 259.
[43:06] It the veil has been lifted off the
[43:09] word. Off of the word. That's right.
[43:11] It's revealed to babes. It's lifted.
[43:15] See, it will be as once said. That's
[43:18] right. Then it will be as one said when
[43:21] you see when this veil is took off the
[43:23] word the traditions is taken of the word
[43:26] as Jesus once said when you see me you
[43:29] see the father
[43:31] God and his word is one. Now you
[43:34] understand when the word is manifested
[43:37] what is it? See
[43:40] so but even this the conquering of our
[43:44] self-will was not something that we
[43:46] could do on our own. Brothers and
[43:48] sisters, Christ had to do it in us, for
[43:51] us.
[43:53] That's the purpose of the second coming.
[43:57] He took care of the blood at Calvary. He
[44:00] showed us the fight in Gethsemane. Not
[44:02] my will, but thine.
[44:05] Right?
[44:07] And yet, he has to come the second time
[44:09] in this day with the revealed word, by
[44:12] the the opening of the seventh seal, by
[44:15] the revealing of the thunders. He has to
[44:17] come into us,
[44:19] do it for us, to break the veil of
[44:22] self-will for us to show us how to do
[44:25] it. He's always the one that can break
[44:28] the veils.
[44:30] So, in other words, it is the revelation
[44:32] of Jesus Christ in you that can break
[44:35] the veils.
[44:37] Now, this is what the breaking of those
[44:38] seals was about, right? The revelation
[44:40] of those seals helped us to see the
[44:43] traditions that kept the old veil
[44:45] standing between the holy place and the
[44:48] most holy place. Our self-will now was
[44:50] made strong against the spirit of God by
[44:53] Satan's reasoning over the ages which
[44:55] was passed down to us. But by the grace
[44:58] of God, he overcame
[45:01] to loose the seals for us that we might
[45:04] know and believe unto tearing down of
[45:06] the veil of self-will that our entire
[45:09] holy place become filled with his glory
[45:12] and our flesh becomes the veil that
[45:15] separates the word from God. That means
[45:17] we become the vessel of the existence of
[45:20] God. And the world when they look at us,
[45:23] they see the veil.
[45:27] Let's read unveiling of God paragraph
[45:28] 269
[45:30] to 270.
[45:34] He says the veil tradition of
[45:36] unbelievers taken away. You see God
[45:40] when the veil of traditions has been
[45:42] removed. You can see that God is still
[45:45] God of his word. He still keeps his
[45:48] word. He is the he is the God author of
[45:52] his word. that is behind skin veils
[45:57] to others. Yes, that is right. To those
[46:01] who cannot go beyond the veil, he is
[46:04] still behind the skin veils.
[46:07] Notice then we when we become part of
[46:11] him as you are the veil that veils him.
[46:14] Did you hear that brother Ram said when
[46:16] we become part of him as you are the
[46:19] veil that veils him? You are part of him
[46:23] as long as Christ is in you. As Christ
[46:26] was of God because God was in him, made
[46:30] him God. And as Christ is in you, the
[46:34] hope of glory, you become part of
[46:36] Christ. He that believeth on me, the
[46:38] works that I do shall he do also. See,
[46:41] you become part of Christ. As long as
[46:43] Christ is hid in you, then it's veiled
[46:46] to the unbeliever. But you know he is in
[46:49] you. You are a temple templing Christ
[46:53] that's behind the veil the skin then
[46:56] behind because of this veil the veil
[46:58] again in human flesh hides God the word
[47:02] from the unbeliever.
[47:05] Amen and amen. So in closing saints the
[47:09] breaking of that veil the veil of the
[47:12] covering
[47:13] what is it? It's the uniting of the most
[47:17] holy and the holy place.
[47:19] It's the uniting of the inner court and
[47:24] the holiest of holies. It's the uniting
[47:27] of the seventh and the sixth dimension.
[47:30] It's the uniting of the soul and the
[47:32] spirit of man.
[47:35] The removal of the veil causes a
[47:38] marriage to take place.
[47:41] Why? Because the room which was once one
[47:46] room had been separated by a veil of
[47:49] self-will. That means the human's
[47:52] ability to make a choice for himself and
[47:55] not have the will of God. If you take
[47:58] that away that self-will and put in
[48:01] there the will of God, then there is no
[48:05] more two rooms. There is one room. It is
[48:08] the uniting of Christ and the bride. It
[48:11] is the making of twain one being the
[48:16] temple of the glory of God and his most
[48:18] glorious throne. The temple being the
[48:22] bride and the the glorious throne being
[48:25] Christ.
[48:27] Removing the veil of self-will brings
[48:30] the two together and makes it one.
[48:34] one glorious tabernacle
[48:38] tearing down again the veil between
[48:40] heaven and in earth and making heaven
[48:43] and earth become one place one court one
[48:48] existence of God
[48:52] praise be to God saints
[48:55] I wish the people can see this could see
[48:58] this now let's focus on you
[49:03] here you are living in this world.
[49:06] You're struggling every single day,
[49:10] right?
[49:12] You have the word, the gene seed in your
[49:14] soul. This what we're talking about. You
[49:16] have the gene seed in your soul.
[49:19] The open book revelation, the third pull
[49:22] revelation
[49:24] gets into your soul realm and is dealing
[49:27] with you in there, changing the nature.
[49:30] And at times in your life, you feel that
[49:33] shakina glory just filling that secret
[49:37] place inside.
[49:39] So much so that the revelation is
[49:41] bursting in you. And yet you just can't
[49:44] manifest it. You don't know how to
[49:47] manifest it. It's uh you want to explain
[49:51] to somebody, you can't express it to
[49:54] them. You want to do something with your
[49:56] body to express it, but you just can't
[49:59] do it.
[50:02] Right? What's the problem with us here?
[50:05] See what we still have a problem with
[50:08] within each individual is that self-will
[50:12] still exists
[50:15] and that veil has to be torn down
[50:19] because
[50:21] when the sacrifice is given
[50:25] the veil is torn and the glory of the
[50:28] Lord fills the entire inner court making
[50:32] of two courts one court,
[50:38] right? Of two dimensions making it one
[50:41] dimension.
[50:43] So here's the problem. We have five
[50:45] senses of the body.
[50:48] See, taste, smell, hear, touch. We have
[50:52] these five senses. We have the five
[50:55] senses of the spirit, right?
[50:57] Imagination, memory, reason, conscience,
[50:59] affection.
[51:02] And we are able to
[51:05] touch this world,
[51:07] feel emotions,
[51:10] reason by those emotions through our
[51:13] mind, make decisions for our life, make
[51:16] decisions for our family, make decisions
[51:18] to buy medical aid, to buy insurance, to
[51:22] go on holiday, to uh build a house, to
[51:25] buy a car, to do all these things that
[51:27] humans are all doing, things of the
[51:30] flesh. We make all these decisions
[51:34] and every part of our life whether to go
[51:36] to church, whether not to go to church,
[51:39] whether to go to school, whether not to
[51:40] go to school, whether to leave and go to
[51:42] university, whether not to go to
[51:44] university, whether to take this job,
[51:46] whether to not take this job. Uh we
[51:49] don't know whether to go to this church
[51:51] or that church.
[51:53] It's the same thing again. Self-will
[51:56] is
[51:58] the veil that we are using and it's it's
[52:02] trapping the shakina glory into our soul
[52:07] preventing the rest of the body from
[52:10] experiencing that presence.
[52:14] All right. Now we know that that veil is
[52:17] there to protect us.
[52:20] Okay. But according to the prophecy,
[52:23] this is the time that that protection
[52:26] must end. That veil must be rent in
[52:30] twain or in two. And the glory of the
[52:34] Lord must be seen in the entire body.
[52:38] Amen. So when you here you are in this
[52:42] world, your mind is in conflict. Your
[52:45] mind is thinking about all sorts of
[52:47] things. what decision to make. You are
[52:49] reasoning, you are trying. So uh um
[52:55] it's so difficult to make decisions for
[52:58] the family for [snorts]
[53:00] in financial crisis in all kinds of
[53:03] other difficulties that we face every
[53:06] single day.
[53:08] Remember how the tabernacle works.
[53:12] We constantly need the Holy Spirit to go
[53:17] through that veil to enter into the
[53:21] Holiest of Holies and bring something
[53:24] out for us to be able to save us every
[53:28] day from making wrong decisions to bring
[53:31] to us a true manifestation of things the
[53:34] way we should be living our lives. So
[53:37] imagine without that high priest, the
[53:39] Holy Spirit to be able to go behind the
[53:43] veil every day come out with that third
[53:46] pull revelation manifest revelation to
[53:49] give to us in our spirit realm to reveal
[53:52] in our minds to manifest in our bodies.
[53:55] Without that we're lost. Every single
[53:58] day will be a disaster. Right?
[54:02] So, but remember it's got to come to a
[54:06] place where we must eventually have that
[54:10] veil torn down.
[54:13] So this is what we want to just look at
[54:15] in this little teaching is to understand
[54:19] that all the veil was was a dividing
[54:25] of this one room, this one building to
[54:28] create two different dimensions.
[54:32] an an inner court and a most holy place
[54:35] or a holy place and a most holy place or
[54:39] the spirit and the soul.
[54:42] So saints, what we're saying is if
[54:47] the revelation of the word, if once
[54:50] you've realized who you are and what
[54:53] your purpose is and you are able to tear
[54:56] away that veil of self-will,
[54:59] the glory in your soul that the book
[55:04] that is open, the divine nature of God
[55:07] that is coming there in secret of the
[55:10] second coming will pour out into your
[55:13] spirit, into your mind, into your
[55:16] thoughts, into your desires, into uh
[55:19] your plans, into daily life, into your
[55:23] thoughts of everything. It will fill the
[55:26] room. And when it fills the room, it
[55:28] will shake the entire house.
[55:31] And then this is the mystery of Christ.
[55:37] when Christ walked on earth and I said
[55:39] we will get to that here in the end.
[55:42] What was the mystery of Christ? Why was
[55:44] he so different when he walked around at
[55:45] those Pharisees and Sadducees and there
[55:48] were a whole lot of men there? Now think
[55:50] of it. Look at them. All those men with
[55:53] the veil of self-will between their soul
[55:56] and their spirit. But Christ had no
[55:59] veil.
[56:02] The veil was his flesh and behind that
[56:05] flesh his entire spirit realm was filled
[56:08] with shakina glory. How do we know?
[56:11] Because from the very beginning he went
[56:14] preaching. I do not come to do my own
[56:17] will. I come to do the will of him that
[56:20] sent me. I do all things of that which
[56:24] the father has sent me to do. I do
[56:26] nothing of myself. I do not come to bear
[56:29] witness of myself. Any I'm just giving
[56:31] you randomly his words. Anyone that
[56:34] bears witness of himself bears a wrong
[56:37] witness. But I come to bear witness of
[56:40] my father. He says things like, "If you
[56:42] don't believe me, believe my works. They
[56:45] testify of him."
[56:47] Right? And all these things, if you've
[56:51] seen me, you've seen the father. What
[56:54] was the difference with Christ? See,
[56:57] because the veil of self-will and right
[57:00] right to Gethsemane where you could see
[57:03] the the the war of the of of the veil
[57:08] where he says, "Lord, if it be thy will,
[57:11] let this cup pass. Nevertheless, not my
[57:15] will but thy will be done."
[57:18] Right? And saints, I believe that's
[57:20] that's where the victory lies today
[57:24] because we're still hanging on to our
[57:27] self-will. The glory that is in our soul
[57:30] is not filling the temple.
[57:33] And it takes sacrifice. When the first
[57:36] veil was rent, it took the sacrifice of
[57:38] Christ to rent the veil. That means in
[57:42] our lives, in every step, if there is
[57:46] something we really want, there's
[57:48] something we really desire,
[57:51] if you step away from what you really
[57:54] want and what you really desire, you
[57:56] break away, you tear down the self-will
[57:58] and you look at the purpose of God and
[58:01] the and the the the purpose that his
[58:03] purpose may stand. And then you'll find
[58:06] you won't even have that desire for that
[58:08] something anymore. You won't even have a
[58:10] fierce desire for what you were desiring
[58:12] because now your will doesn't matter. It
[58:15] is his will that matters. And when that
[58:18] takes place, saints, before that, when
[58:21] you were really desiring something, you
[58:23] were your spirit was experiencing
[58:25] anxiety, depression, lack of sleep. You
[58:29] were discussing with your wife, with
[58:31] your friends. Should I do this? Should I
[58:33] buy this? Should I take this job? Should
[58:35] I
[58:37] uh do this this way? Should I go here?
[58:39] Should I go? Whatever your decision was
[58:42] to make, you were living a paranoid,
[58:45] fearful, not restful,
[58:48] stressed life. But when you sacrifice
[58:51] that thing
[58:54] and let go and tear down that veil of
[58:57] self-will, then the glory from the soul
[59:00] spreads out into making one room of
[59:04] twain. And then the only veil that there
[59:07] is is the flesh. And then who are you
[59:10] then? You are Christ standing on two
[59:14] feet. You are the existence of God with
[59:19] man.
[59:21] Praise be to God. This is why it's so
[59:23] important to understand the tabernacle
[59:27] and the pattern of the tabernacle
[59:29] because what we look through in the Old
[59:32] Testament when we study the tabernacle
[59:34] of Moses, the tabernacle of heaven, we
[59:37] eventually bring it back down to us in a
[59:40] simple thing like this to understand
[59:42] what the veil is, the dividing user
[59:44] between soul and spirit, how it
[59:47] operates. I guarantee you we can talk
[59:49] more and more and more in this for a
[59:51] long time.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[59:53] &gt;&gt; because there is so much to declare on
[59:55] these things. But I trust that you will
[59:57] understand in this simple teaching what
[1:00:00] it really means, what that most holy
[1:00:03] place really is, and why it was there,
[1:00:07] why it was temporary, why there was a
[1:00:10] need for Christ to come to tear down
[1:00:12] that veil, and why he had to prepare for
[1:00:15] us to come to the strength to do the
[1:00:18] same thing in this end time. We have the
[1:00:21] answer to the devil's question
[1:00:24] and this is the answer.
[1:00:26] It's not some great flashy,
[1:00:29] you know, flamboyant
[1:00:32] ministry that you have to have in the
[1:00:34] whole world. It's a simple case of
[1:00:37] tearing down the veil of self-will. May
[1:00:41] God help us. The Lord bless you until
[1:00:44] the next time.
