TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Praise the Lord. Let's as we're standing turn in our Bibles or you can follow on the screen and we're going to uh read a small portion of scripture from Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 10. And it says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are in earth, even in him. Amen. The Lord add a blessing to his word. You may be seated. So, we appreciate the Lord this morning and we're certainly thankful for his grace and mercy with us. And so, um, we trust that the Lord will bless us this morning with the word. And I'm hoping this is going to be the, uh, closing of the series, this short little series which started with the Sunday school, the story of God and man. And this is part six. It always sounds strange when you end on a part six but um so to today our [clears throat] our title or subject rather gathering together in one all things in Christ and for a title heaven and earth embracing. Amen. So, uh, I just want to say it's been a real beautiful, um, portion of the word that we've been looking at for the last part of the series. And it's been really also, uh, quite nicely tying up with the uh, uh, the series that we just started in Newcastle on on um, the stature of a perfect man. So, I'm trusting that the Lord will lead us further and further. And I also because of the last time we were here and we spoke on truth. I had some inspiration to also uh speak a little bit on that because of what we started with the Sunday school and because there's not enough time till the ending of the year and um till the the closing of uh uh services of the year. So I just want to probably um speak a little bit about truth. Maybe the next time we we come together, I'll just see how the Lord leads us. Who knows? There might be a part seven. I don't know. So, but this series, a lot of this series, some of you would remember, is taken from our I don't know how many parts we did in the adoption series in 2015 and also before that. A lot of things, a lot of statements, a lot of uh quotes, scriptures and and uh some of the teaching in there is from there. So, some of you can go back and there's far more detail in the uh series there on adoption, a gene of your father, predestination, so much that we put in there. I really I think we must have done that one over two years or so. So, we're thankful to God anyway that he can lead us this way. So I'm also thankful to brother Liam for last week and give him one week to preach and he lose his voice you know [laughter] so need to do it more often but I know we're thankful for that and uh I'm I'm very grateful to the Lord for the ministry in our church and the brothers and I like the way that we all look at things differently and and it's so wonderful It's it's amazing that we even the brothers on the fellowship group who put on the devotions and just the way you see things is so refreshing. So I just appreciate the gifts that God gives to his sons. Amen. So um I'm you know looking at the scripture the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him. So this scripture is loaded with revelation. Just one little verse is so loaded with revelation. So I want to draw your attention to five things that are in there. Number one, and this is what we're going to break down this morning. The dispensation of the fullness of times. Look at how specific it is. There's so much to understand there. There's firstly there's dispensation, then there's fullness, and then it says of times. You can just read over that and wonder what does this mean and make up your own story about it. But the prophet gives us guidance. The Bible gives us guidance. Amen. Then there it says, "Gathering or gathered together in one all things in Christ." Right? But then it gets even more specific. It says, "Which are in heaven." In other words, it's telling us there are things that are in Christ which are in heaven. And then there are things which are in earth which are in Christ. So there are things that are in Christ that are in heaven and there are things that are in Christ which are in earth and in the dispensation of the fullness of time he's going to gather all that together in one right. Uh and lastly it says which are in him. I don't know why that's not there we go even in him. So you got it. You break that whole scripture down into five parts. There's a dispensation of the fullness of times. And we got to ask ourselves, when's that? When is that dispensation? Is that the millennium? Is that the new heaven and new earth? Has it passed? Is it now? And then gathered together in one all things in Christ. What does that mean? Things which are in heaven, things which are in earth, even in him. Praise be to God. So the dispensation of the fullness of times I'll just say it is this age. &gt;&gt; It is the bride age and we're going to show you that through the teaching. It is the age of adoption. So if you read all the verse now it's not the Leodysian age. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; That's certainly not the age of adoption. &gt;&gt; Yes. The Leodysian age is certainly not the the the dispensation of the fullness of times. We have to put that up into the the the ages and dispensations to show it to you. So if you read um excuse me from the rest of the verses from Ephesians 1 verse 3-9. So we read verse 10. If you read from verse 3 to9, uh you know how that's the whole adoption scripture, uh it basically says, I'm not going to read the whole thing. I'm going to paraphrase it for you. You will see that it says God having chosen us. Remember it says in him according to the purpose of his own will and so on. You remember that having chosen us in him. All right, Sunday school people who in the logos having selected us having elected us having chosen us in the logos remember let's go back to part one before the foundation of the world by fornowledge saw that we would come into being on earth and then he predestinated us unto good works in Christ and determined ed it that we should receive the revelation of his will. These are all from verse 3 to verse 9. Uh that one day he would gather together all things in Christ, things that are which in heaven, theophony, things on earth, predestinated fleshly bodies, and gather them all together in one, which we call the rapture. Yeah. &gt;&gt; In him [snorts] who is the word in him who it all started with the logos king theophony. Do you get the picture? That's what Ephesians 3 to9 and and verse 10 is actually telling us. It's telling us the story of man and God. God and man. So we want to begin with the dispensation of times. Now the word dispensation is a very peculiar word and not very easy to understand. In fact a lot of people today do not use the word dispensation. You know you you don't find you meet a colleague at work and says you know how you doing? Oh, well, you know, I'm in the dispensation of having toddlers or, you know, I'm in the dispensation of uh being engaged or I'm in the dispensation of, you know, pot-bellied father, middle-aged, you know, nobody talks like that. Dispensation is like an ancient word now to people. Uh, in fact, we don't even use the word age anymore. You know, I'm in that age. In fact, today we use the word phase. You know, he's going through a phase. I'm going through a phase. You know, it'll phase out someday and then another one will phase in maybe. I don't know. But that's kind of like what it is where people talk about it today. But it comes from different meanings. Dispensation comes from different thoughts and expresses many different things. One part of the meaning comes from the idea of dispensing. Dispensation. Dispensing. So dispensing. If you imagine like you have a a big jug of water, like a 5 L jug of water, and then you have a one liter bottle and maybe a half a liter bottle and then a few glasses or or tumblers, whatever you call them at your place. And then you take this 5 L jug and you start pouring water into the one liter. and then the half a liter and the tumblers, right? What are you doing? You're dispensing. You're pouring out of the main source into others, right? That's one of the meanings. The another part of the of the meaning of dispensation is a period of time. Okay? Another part of the meaning comes from the meaning of a system of ruling, a system of governing, a system of revealing. So when YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER, pouring out period of time, a system of governance, you have to put it all together because that's where you're going to understand it. What we what we find is in a period of time, God pours out of himself, God reveals a part of himself by the word in a particular way, and that particular way governs that time. Right? You so you couldn't say that in the time of Moses they were governing by the revelation of Jesus Christ. They were not. It was a different age, a different time period. And the governance there according to God was very different to the time of Christ. It was a different governance to the church. In the same way here we are now in the church. We are not being governed like it was in the time of Moses. &gt;&gt; Yet it's the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Brother Bam teaches us that there were many different dispensations since Adam. But there were three major dispensations and the most significant dispensations of time in our past are those three. They'll those those so three major dispensations and and under those were broken up the smaller dispensations or what we call ages right so um of course there is one more major dispensation to come after this uh um but let's have a look at what we have today let's go to spiritual um adoption as we look into this dispensation of time Um, did I miss something? Okay, there we go. Now, are you still with me? &gt;&gt; Now, three is the number of perfection and that is uh that God is perfected, the one true eternal God is perfected in three dispensations of his Godhead manifestation. Three dispensations, THREE DISPENSATIONS of himself. So God, the self-existing one, remember that one, right? The fountain of seven colors, the spirit who existed, the I am. Right. Right. So there's three dispensations he's going to bring upon man. And that's father, son, and holy ghost. Now when you when you look at it like that, immediately this is not a godhead problem. This is not about godhead. This is about God manifesting himself. So he's pouring himself out as father over a period of time and governing him his people by that. THEN HE POURS HIMSELF OUT AS SON. He dispenses himself out as son and governs by that over a period of time. And then there is holy ghost. Holy spirit. Is that right? Doesn't mean there is I'm reading now. doesn't mean there is three different individual gods but there is one God represented in three not three people not three persons not three personalities three dispensations &gt;&gt; yes amen &gt;&gt; God is not three God is one but three manifestations of his godhead &gt;&gt; or godhood &gt;&gt; was the original word godhood what is godhood good being God, right? A whole lot of uh uh like for example, I explained this to you in in the message I preached to you uh I in you, you in me when we spoke on the godhead um and we showed you the the original word was godhood, right? And uh it how do we understand this? For example, what is neighborhood? You can't be one person living in an area and call yourself a neighborhood. You have to have neighbors &gt;&gt; to have a neighborhood. You can't be one person and call yourself a brotherhood. You've got to have brothers to have a brotherhood. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is godhood? What is Godhead? It is the parts that make him go to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So for example under the father or under Jehovah what was the godhood or the godhead in the time of Moses? The godhead comprised of Moses the prophet Aaron the high priest the intercessor and the most holy &gt;&gt; with the ark of the covenant. That was WHAT IT THE PARTS THAT made him go to the people. They could NOT HEAR HIS WORD EXCEPT THROUGH MOSES. &gt;&gt; YES. They could not find salvation except through the intercessor taking the blood into the holiest of holies. That was God to them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Moses, Aaron, and the shikina of glory. That was the Godhead in Moses time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So when people argue about father, son, and holy ghost, all they're arguing and fussing about is theology. &gt;&gt; Yes. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; They don't understand what godhead really means. When it comes in Galatians and it says in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily, IT'S TELLING YOU ALL THE PARTS &gt;&gt; are in him. &gt;&gt; HEBREWS TELLS US THAT HE'S the tabernacle. He is the mercy seat. He's the sacrifice. He's the high priest. &gt;&gt; He's the law. HE'S EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING ELSE WAS a shadow of him. &gt;&gt; So in him dwells the FULLNESS OF THE GODHEAD. AND HERE we have people fussing. That means father, son, holy ghost is in him. No, there's so much more to it. &gt;&gt; ALL THE PARTS that make God God to us dwelt in Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise be to his name. But there are three manifestations of his Godhead. Now if you if you doubt what I told you, three manifestations of his godhead, meaning three dispensations of time on earth perfects the one true and living God. &gt;&gt; So he's not talking about three persons. He says three manifestations of his godhead means three dispensations of time. &gt;&gt; Yes. where God would reveal himself to his people in three different manifestations of time. Are we together? All right. So, people, for those of you listening today and those of you online, there's a lot I'm going to tell you. And some of you, hopefully not here this morning, will feel the compulsion to say that I'm making things up. I assure you I'm not. I got a lot of that this year, by the way. A lot of people telling me I'm making things up. I just don't understand. I mean, to me, you can you can take quotes and scriptures and you can just talk about it and fuss about it over the surface level, but how about studying it? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know, really getting into it. Like I hear this fuss about, you know, the name of Jesus. We the new name of God, Mrs. Jesus. We are Mrs. Jesus. You should really sit down and think about whether you want to be called that. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; We have a jubilee about being called Mrs. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Do you know what the meaning of Jesus is? &gt;&gt; Jehovah's Savior. &gt;&gt; You really want to take that name &gt;&gt; and claim it and shout and make songs about it and read quotes and have a hallelujah whatever time to take that name means you are Jehovah's Savior. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you are saying I'm Mrs. Jehovah savior and then your life doesn't even behave like savior. &gt;&gt; You're not an intercessor for people. You don't give to the poor. You don't take care of the he the needy. You don't go uh proclaim healing upon the sick, but you want the name. Why? Because in theory, Mrs. Jesus. &gt;&gt; This is the problem I have with legalists because you only fuss about the quotes and you want to be direct about the quotes. But how about teaching it? How about getting it under the surface level? How about getting to what it really means? Get it to convict people's lives and make them think about it. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, Mrs. Jesus becomes a blasphemous name. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Go read that message. Blasphemous names. you'll have a real wakeup call. So, I'm not making things up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to take my word for it. You don't even have to trust me. I know a lot of people say, "Trust me." It's such a strange statement we get used to. Trust me. No, don't trust me. Go read for yourself. Go study it. &gt;&gt; Go and don't just read a quote and read scriptures and say in a legalistic way, I stay with what the tape says. Go look under the surface. go to the depths of it and check it for yourself. So I can tell you from years and years of studying and combing through the the message, I am confident in telling you everything I'm going to tell you today is from the message and the Bible. And it is the word himself being made known to us today. All right. So three dispensations of time. You know, I figure I I don't care anymore. Uh people are going to criticize me no matter what I say. Putting myself on the internet, you know. Well, not me. The judge putting me on the internet, put a target on my back and my forehead and everywhere else, you know. So, I'm I'm okay with that. It's whatever we're going to say, we're going to be judged for it. I just believe the word has to get out to the world. And however it goes in this fourth dimension, so be it. If they if I'm even shot from behind by my own brothers, it's okay, right? Uh and and those who claim to be a part of us, it's fine. We got to let this word go. We got to let it go out to the people and let them argue, let them fuss, let them question, let them search, let them look deeper. That's all. And we'll get some things right. We'll get some things not so right. We might even get some things wrong. And then God will correct us on that. &gt;&gt; But we're not afraid because he told us, "PUT YOUR FOOT IN JORDAN." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; STEP IN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that's what I'm going to do. Go make footprints on your promises. I'm &gt;&gt; not going to stand back and say, "No, I'm I'm going to wait for what the prophet told me. &gt;&gt; The prophet told me, go make footprints. &gt;&gt; You have not walked this way before. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do." So, I'm not just going to fight about godhead doctrine and whether it's trinity or oneness. I left that 20 years ago, long time ago. I'm done with that. I'm not even arguing that. It's not even a question in my mind anymore. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I FIT in into the Godhead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I believe that I do. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I believe that's what the message came to reveal to us. &gt;&gt; All right. So let's go to the dispensation of the father. Okay. So here's a diagram that I drew for you many many years ago, right? And uh at first it was not even in color. It was just black and white. And I must say I cannot take uh um any praise for this diagram. This is a diagram I grew up with from preachers who came before me. uh I just improved on some of the things and you know but these are what my teachers taught me while I was growing up. So yeah so I don't take any uh accolades for uh you know if it's not something that I've done. All right so looking at the diagram the title there is the dispensations of time. Okay. And basically taking it as each segment of a thousand years as one day. So, we're up to 6,000 years now. Uh, we're past 6,000 years and we're already into the next thousand. Okay, everyone agree? &gt;&gt; All right. So, now if you look at the bottom of the diagram, I've got these larger arcs which show us the dispensation. The first one, you'll see the dispensation of father spanned 4,000 years. Can you see that? And then, well, this is not going to work. Okay. Oh, I should have had a long stick. [clears throat] Uh, and then the dispensation of sun. So, let's explain it for those who can't see it cuz I know everyone over 50, I'm getting there, you know, if you don't have uh your thick glasses on today, you're not reading. But let's have a look. So, from Adam, let's say it that way. From Adam to Noah was a thousand years. Noah to Abram a thousand years. Abram to Solomon a thousand years. Solomon to Christ a thousand. So from Adam to Christ 4,000 years, right? From Christ, son of man to this time is another 2,000 years, right? And that's the dispensation of the sun. There's no mystery about that because that's when Jesus came 2,000 years ago and that's when God became known as Jesus. That was a dispensation of the son. And then of course we are now in this this dispensation of the bride. All right. So let's go through it step by step. Let's break it down. The dispensation of the father. This begins with God above us. Why? Because for for 4,000 years God is invisible. God comes as a appears as all kinds of things. A pillar of fire, pillar of cloud. And he uses all kinds of things to veil himself, right? And then even if he appears as an angel, he never appears as the same looking angel. And every because every time he appears, they ask him, "What's your name?" He says, "My name is a secret." And then, of course, he tells him, "His name is Jehovah." And then later on, Samson Samson's father asks him, "What's your name?" came and he says my name is a secret. Are you with us? So was he Jehovah or not? You get what I'm saying? So he keeps appearing in forms but never claiming a form as that's my form. He told them do not make any form or image. No male, no female, no bird, no fish, no no beast, nor anything, no creeping thing. All you heard was a voice. Is that right? God above us. Now the time period, this first time period from the age of conscience, can you see that big yellow arrow? The age of conscience. What does that mean? From Adam to Abraham, there was no scripture, no church, no form of worship, no uh uh altar that God ordained, no songs, no prophets, no holy men walking around preaching. There was no form of prayer. So for 2,000 years, they had no church. How do they serve God? By conscience. By doing good works. By following originally what Adam had passed down to all his sons. Conscience. Age of conscience. [snorts] Right? And and that's uh under that we found two covenants. Now watch this. Under each age there are covenants. Now what is a covenant? It's a promise God makes with man or a like a deal, right? Like a contract God makes with man. He made the first covenant with Adam, the Adamic covenant. The next one with Noah, which we call the Noahic covenant. This is not something we made up. This is something that is they teach in uh schools of theology and they and the prophet used the same words as well. Are you still with me? Okay. So under this dispensation, the two major covenants God made with man was the Adamic and the Noah covenant. And this dispensation lasts 2,000 years. And the promises of these covenants, now watch, THE PROMISES OF THESE covenants were not met, were not fulfilled in the days that they were given because man always failed. &gt;&gt; Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Yes. the covenants WERE NOT RECEIVED BY THOSE men because man failed to come to maturity under those dispensations. So in other words, with every covenant that is made, it never comes to fulfillment. But God keeps his covenants. &gt;&gt; So if man failed and the covenant was not fulfilled, there's got to be a time when all those covenants are fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So that proved and and what does this prove? It proves to us that try as you might, you cannot serve God with a conscience. Your conscience is going to fail you. We have 2,000 years of proof. [gasps] Right? That you can't you you can say, "Brother Al, I'm a good guy. I'm a good person. I give to charity. I feed the poor. I um you know, I forgive everybody. And uh I'm not jealous. and I don't get angry. I'm I've got my temperance and my patience and I come to church. I'm a good person. Or I don't come to church. Um I'm I'm just a good person. I don't need God. I don't need the open book. I don't need the five-fold ministry. I don't need anything. I I am a good person and I if there's ever a heaven, I deserve to go there. That's your problem. Cuz there's no man that deserves anything there. The Bible even tells us there is no one good but God. Amen. All right. So let's move on. So this proves to us that man could not attain harmony or oneness with God by serving God out of a good conscience. Now what is this? This is the closing of the story of God and man. It's bringing everything back together in just a different understanding. Right? So after that we have the age of law. That's that red one. It's a good color for the age of law. Um, and under that, God makes a covenant with Abraham. Mosaic covenant, that is a covenant with Moses, and the Davidic covenant, which is the covenant he made with David. And here's THE AMAZING THING. ALL those covenants were not met. God kept some things, but man kept failing. MAN KEPT DOING OTHER things that caused the covenant to be continued. Is that right? God's covenant with Abram. Abram didn't live to see it. He got the promised son, but didn't live to see his seed multiplied as the stars. He didn't live to see the land being taken by his seed. Amen. With David, he told David, I will establish your throne forever. There was promise of a son of David. And everyone thought it was Solomon. And then Solomon failed and married like a thousand women. Man was crazy. SO IT OBVIOUSLY NEVER MET. That's why the Jews knew there is a son of David still to come and that they believe that the Messiah would come and reestablish David's throne on earth. THE DAVIDIC COVENANT STILL HAS A PROMISE OUTSTANDING. Are you with us? All right. So, we all got that. And the amazing part of it, something I really didn't want to speak about, but when you look at this, why is it called father? Because father has children. In other words, the relationship with God is about father and children. And what's the relationship between a father and a child? It's instruction. It's law. So when you look at this why it ties so much into stature of a perfect man because as a father he starts there with Adam and Noah and Abraham they're like toddlers conscience right you can't give them law from the very beginning but then they start growing and then in Moses the law comes in and now he's dealing with like teenagers are you with me thou shalt not thou shalt now I'm giving you knowledge I'm giving you law I'm giving you uh um uh a form of worship. I'm giving you covenants. I'm giving you the blood of sacrifice. I'm giving you all these uh the priesthood. Now, you're dealing with them as teenagers, but every once in a while, they got to get a whipping. &gt;&gt; Amen. God couldn't remain or ever have an intimate relationship with man by remaining as father. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So the dispensation comes to an end. Nobody's saying father comes to an end. We're saying the dispensation of father comes to an end. Right? And then comes the son of man who DOES WHAT? HE SAYS I CAME TO DECLARE THE FATHER. &gt;&gt; He even says if you've seen me you've seen the father. &gt;&gt; Right? So the next dispensation we have now before we get the the next major dispensation there's a short small dispensation that pops in. It's a dispensation of the son of man and it's a mysterious dispensation. Why? This is God with us. Remember what was dispensation of father? God above us. God invisible. God you could not touch. God you could not speak to. You had to speak to the high priest or speak to the prophet and the prophet would go in and speak with God behind the veil. You could not you could not touch him. You could not see him. You could not make any form. You could not pray by yourself. You had to pray through someone. Do you remember Hannah standing in the temple and she's standing there praying and Eli comes up and says, "Are you crazy? Are you drunk? Well, then you have to be drunk for you to be doing this. You're not allowed to do this. You are supposed to come and confess your issue here and we will take your prayers before God. But now God with us, Emmanuel, we touched him without controversy. God was manifested in the flesh. Is this right? God with us. HE BECAME FLESH. SO AND AND this is a very very short dispensation. This dispensation involved the coming the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and it spanned 33 and a half years short outpouring of God in this one body called Christ. Are you with me? And basically what happens now we can look back from 2025 and we can look back into the into the past and we see something very significant. Ah it takes a coming of the son of man to change a major dispensation. [snorts] It took a coming of a son of man the first coming to change from father to son to holy ghost dispensation. It takes this coming. So if there is a coming of the son of man, it's going to change A DISPENSATION. WHAT IS CHANGING A DISPENSATION of God? It's bringing a new song, a new temple, a new word, a new testament, a new way of worship, A NEW WAY OF PREACHING, A NEW REVELATION, a new path to God, A NEW WAY OF SALVATION. It was here that God revealed himself in human flesh as a vessel of flesh. all previous dispensations and covenants. In other words, conscience and law was now in Christ, perfected in Christ. Are you with me? And he was a man of full maturity. Is that right? Now, under this dispensation, he made a covenant of salvation, right? through his own blood a covenant of new life after death. So what does Christ come to confirm? That if you believe in me, you shall have everlasting life. Right? If you believe in me, though you die, you shall live again. It's a covenant I'm making with you. He's saying, right? And he makes a covenant of filling the living with the Holy Ghost. I will not leave you comfortless. I will pray the father. He will send you the holy ghost in my name. He shall guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; Are you with us? This dispensation was about introducing a character of a man of full maturity in God. The stature of the fullness of Christ. Why did he have to show you this? because you now have a directive that you can be that and that it's going to take the next few ages to bring that to pass. Are you with us? So it was greatly rejected by the world at that time. They crucified that man. They put him to death not realizing that was the very purpose so that he could show that he could live again. And that time and it began at the next major uh dispensation. That little dispensation of 33 and 1/2 years began the next major dispensation. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; So let's shrink down the church ages. This is now the age of grace. That is that blue blue arrow? It's not green, right? Okay. Age of grace. Now in between there right there in the center the first thousand years we we already hit the dark ages right in the age of Thotyra. Are you with us? Right. So during this 2,000 years there are the seven church ages as prophesied in the book of revelations. This is now God with us and in the elect. So he said he we'll read the scripture. God with us and in you. I will be with you and in you. So he's with us in terms of uh Christ the Holy Ghost with us but to the elect only the elect he would be also in them. &gt;&gt; Are you with us? &gt;&gt; In part this dispensation approximately 2,000 years lasted approximately 2,000 years. It begins with the son of man first coming and it ends with son of man second coming &gt;&gt; right and it's a complete outpouring of the son the son of god right now you know I did this with you with so many series but I just want to explain that to you and just so you understand under the dispensation of the father in the first 4,000 years those men served God by conscience and the law. Those men were killers, voracious killers, violent men, right? They had no knowledge of Jesus Christ. They had no compassion for the weak. They were the ones given the task to go and take out the Canaanites and and cleanse the land of all the sin and and filth and iniquity and immoral immorality. Is that right? And these are the people who This is uh David who kills Goliath with a stone that sinks through the guy's forehead. This is Samson who tears apart a lion and kills a thousand uh Philistines with the jawbone of a donkey. Uh you know need I go on to tell you how many of them and what their acts were. Those were ACTS OF THE HOLY Spirit in man according to the dispensation for their day. Don't you think for one second you can go and take out the Vatican with the jawbone of a donkey &gt;&gt; or think you can go fight against the Pentecostals with actual violence or think you're going to go take down the mark of the beast with hordes of message people storming their buildings. That was a different dispensation. Yes. &gt;&gt; This dispensation is suffer the wrong, turn the other cheek, &gt;&gt; love your enemies. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; This do you understand how this is the dispensation of son? &gt;&gt; It's a completely different relationship between God and man. Is there is nothing that compares it to the father dispensation. Absolute chalk and cheese. There's that phrase complete opposites. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Can you see that? So this is why even trying to behave like you know like you can just see today you know you see some guy there who's a Christian and then he's he he grows out his beard and puts a stick on and takes a robe and puts it over him and takes off shoes and wears sandals and walks around in the hills muttering to himself. You're not going to think he's an Old Testament prophet. You'd think it's crazy &gt;&gt; because God's not dealing with us with Old Testament prophets anymore. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOBODY COMING out of the wilderness who eats locusts and wild honey and like John the Baptist to come and tell you something and you'll think, "Go have a bath, man." You know, come to church, clean up. It's a completely new dispensation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; A new revelation of God himself. A new song, a new worship, a new testament, a new temple, a new way of worship, and new scriptures, completely new REVELATION OF THE SAME GOD. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. In here is the covenant of leading us into all truth. Is that the promise? He will lead you into all truth. Covenant of the secret coming in that throughout the ages the covenant was kept. He is coming. He is coming. He is coming again. The advent of Christ in the fourth age. Is that right? Right up to the last days until it becomes and there's the theology of the rapture that comes in among the Pentecostals. He is coming. Christ is coming. Jesus is coming. Uh I mean in South Africa, South Africa was a very very Christian country for a long time until recently. But it was always, you know, you could you could drive around, you'll see painted on the rocks, under bridges, at the train stations, at the bus depot. Jesus is coming. Jesus is coming. Now it's a whole lot of junk and graffiti and rubbish that they paint everywhere. Before it used to be Jesus is coming in all kinds of languages, too. Oh yeah, not anymore. It seems to have escaped them. So it was a complete outpouring of the sun was the first dispensation. This is now the dispensation of God upon the Gentiles under the father. It was the dispensation of God over the Jews, Israel, Abram's seed, Adam's lineage. Are you with us? THIS IS THE FIRST DISPENSATION OF God through the son Jesus Christ. God revealing HIMSELF AS GOD TO GENTILES WITHOUT OR OUTSIDE OF JUDAISM. In other words, we don't need a high priest. We don't need the ark of the covenant. We don't need a lamb and a bullock and a ram for atonement. We don't need sacrifices of letting the living bird loose and the speckled bird and oh the the the goats. We don't need uh a Passover, feast of unleaven bread, feast of trumpets, feast of Pentecost, feast of first fruits, uh feast of atonement, FEAST OF TABERNACLES. WE DON'T NEED ALL THAT. THAT WAS WORSHIP TO GOD AT ONE STAGE. WE DON'T HAVE any of that today. I shouldn't even be saying this, but I'm saying this because I want to make you understand. It was a complete flip. Same God different dispensation, different covenants. But once again, to those who were under those covenants, they failed. They failed in every age to let the Holy Ghost lead them into all truth. They denominated. They made up stories about the the come the coming of the Lord. They made up new theologies, new ideas, and it failed them. Let's read John 14 16. Oh my. I think I didn't put this in. Did I not put this in? Um, looks like I didn't. All right, I'll just read this to you. John 14:16-1 17. And I will pray the Father. He shall give you another comforter that he might abide with you forever. Even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. So this would be a continuation of Emmanuel which is God with us but only to the elect it is also God in us. &gt;&gt; In other words God dwelling with us. Listen he said for he dwelleth with you. &gt;&gt; Yes &gt;&gt; now already. But he shall be in you. A promise of the future. You will not only have Emmanuel, God with you. Will not only have God with you in in the presence of the Holy Ghost. You will all he shall be in you. &gt;&gt; There's a promise of him going to be in you as well. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So in other words, when when they got the Holy Ghost in the the church ages, they had the earnest &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; of the inheritance. They had the down payment. They had a portion of the Holy Spirit in each age waiting for the full payment &gt;&gt; and they did not attain it. A new covenant was made under the dispensation and there would be a return of the son of man. All right, let's get to the second mysterious dispensation of son of man which is our day. Now this is the problem. This is where you're stuck. This is where Christians of the world are stuck. We have been promised the days of Elijah. We've been promised the days of the son of man returning. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we know this from Luke 17:30. We know this from other scriptures. In the day of the son of man, when the son of man is revealed, we have all those scriptures. Christ is speaking of that as being in the future while he is there. In other words, while he's there was not the revealing of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Yet, the son of man was there. HE'S SAYING THERE'S COMING A DAY WHEN THE SON OF MAN SHALL be revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, there's plenty of of evidence in the scripture pointing us. Now, the thing is, has that happened or not? Right? And if it happens, this is once again going to be God with us. Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; A son of man revealing the son of man. &gt;&gt; A dispensation of God with us. What happens here if you can receive it is the opening of the seventh seal twofolds, right? The cloud, the mysterious week and a covenant of marriage. In other words, a bride is going to be pulled out. There is going to be a bride in this last day. We saw that covenant taking place where the prophet was saying, "Lord, he was so fatting about it. What is my purpose?" Whatever. And he opens up in his Genesis 24. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. In other words, an Elisa commission. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Given to this ministry to go and find a bride for Isaac. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. This is the covenants made under this mysterious coming of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Now if you receive it, you become a part of that ministry. If you don't receive it, you're not. You're going to continue as if you're continuing in a seventh church age waiting for something to happen. BUT IF YOUR EYES ARE OPEN to it like Rebecca who sees Elea, accepts the message, accepts the secret under the seventh seal and comes out to see him in the field, takes the camels home, sees him in the field, and goes with him into the third fold, which is the tent. &gt;&gt; All the types are there. There's a covenant of marriage made here. Declaration of time being no more. This is what happens under this. This is the amazing thing because when the seventh seal opens, there's a declaration of marriage. That's a mystery under the seventh seal. And a declaration that time shall be no more. &gt;&gt; That's what this whole thing is all about now, right? God with us. And this again is a quick short mysterious dispensation overlapping the dispensation of the Holy Ghost. In other words, the grace age is continuing. This one drops in and it overlaps that and is moving us out. A third exodus taking a bride out of a church. &gt;&gt; The covenant of marriage made a promise was made that a short new age would occur in which a GROUP OF FULLY MATURED SONS and daughters of God would be able to come into THE MARRIAGE OF THE word &gt;&gt; and the bride, &gt;&gt; A STATE OF EQUALITY WITH HIM. WHAT IS happening that logos who was in the beginning HAS COME TO HIS counterpart on earth HIS CO-EQUAL part to be united. It could never happen under any other dispensation. The logos could never be married to those under the father dispensation was constantly making intercession for them through the blood of animals. Is that right? They could never attain equality. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Under the grace dispensation. What is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the age of grace all about? IT'S INTERCESSION FOR IGNORANCE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. For ignorance, not mistakes and failures and faults and all that. Ignorance meaning you're worshiping GOD ONLY PART KNOWING HIM. &gt;&gt; Having only part revelation OF WHO GOD IS. YOU COULD NOT COME TO THE MARRIAGE. SO THERE HAS TO be a dispensation where the fullness of the word is come. IT COMES TO A FULLY MATURED GROUP OF people who come to the fullness, &gt;&gt; the equality. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; TO BECOME EQUAL PARTNERS WITH the logos. &gt;&gt; That's the marriage was a combining. It's a blending. It's a coming together of two dimensions. the dimension of heaven and earth. Before this marriage could happen under the ministry of Elea, a mighty angel, a messenger from heaven had to descend into this dimension and declare that time is no more and declare the last dispensation coming to an end. Yes, &gt;&gt; that would be declaring what? The dispensation of the fullness of times &gt;&gt; in which he would gather together all things in Christ in one, both which are in heaven and which are in earth, even in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we are. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we can literally look back in history and and see that we are not in that Holy Ghost dispensation anymore. We are not in the grace age anymore. Of course, we have received grace. &gt;&gt; We're not saying there's no more grace. WE CAN'T EVEN SAY THERE'S no more law. We don't even say there's no more conscience. We be dead. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; ALL OF THAT STILL EXISTS. THERE'S JUST A NEW DISPENSATION WHICH IS THE PERFECTION of all others. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So, that's where we are right now. the dispensation of the bride. God is no more above us, invisible, pillar of fire, pillar of cloud. God is no longer Jesus Christ from 2,000 years ago. GOD IS NO LONGER JUST HOLY GHOST, BAPTISM, ANOINTINGS, HEALINGS, MIRACLES, DISCERNMENTS, all those kind of things. GOD IS NO LONGER JUST THOSE THINGS. God is now becoming his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. his people WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE story of God and man. He created man for this purpose. AND THIS IS THE TRIAL of people today because your sin, your mistakes, your problems. This is a reason why pastors and ministers can't accept this coming BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ACCEPT THAT GOD CAN BE YOU. &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT THAT GOD CAN be you? Number one is your definition of God. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S your main problem. You don't understand the mystery of God. YOU THINK GOD IS JUST AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP TO WHOM OTHERS must bow down, sing, and pray to. That's the starting point. If you don't know what God is, you could never be him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's why they they criticize us and tell us like I DON'T KNOW WHY ARE YOU IN THE MESSAGE THEN WHY DON'T JUST GO TO DENOMINATION WHAT ARE YOU HEARING THE MESSAGE BECAUSE THE MESSAGE TELLS US THIS &gt;&gt; THIS VERY THING &gt;&gt; THAT THIS IS WHAT WE WERE CHOSEN FOR &gt;&gt; LIKE I I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU PREACHING THE SEVENTH SEAL WHY TALKING about and using buzzwords WHY READING THE SCRIPTURE WHY TALKING ABOUT IT IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT JUST LET IT GO AND WALK WAY. AMEN. This is the fullness of times. The fullness means the maximum. It means to come to complete maturity. It therefore refers to the age of adopted sons, manifested sons. &gt;&gt; THOSE WHO WERE BECOMING SONS ARE NOW become sons. And yes, this is this is the mediocre limp noodle arguments [clears throat] that I get. Oh, if you're a son, where's the power of spoken word? Why aren't you speaking things into existence? Well, I'm like, I wish I COULD SPEAK YOUR STUPIDITY OUT OF EXISTENCE. &gt;&gt; That's where I am right now. BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. WE'RE NOT here to go and make miracles because we know it's already been told us that in the Bible that that THAT THAT POWER that beast power coming out of the earth is GOING TO GO OFF and and deceive the whole world with MIRACLES AND CAUSE FIRE TO COME OUT FROM HEAVEN. WHAT WHAT are we doing? Trying to fight back with that beast. This is the time where I MEAN WHY do you need to go and speak things into existence when you can't even deal with your own marriage &gt;&gt; or your children or your house or get some good accounting so you pay your bills &gt;&gt; and don't run short. You want to manage God's kingdom and speak things into existence. You can't even manage your own budget. THIS IS THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS IS IMMATURITY. What are WE WAITING FOR? OH, I CAN'T WAIT, BROTHER. WHEN I GET THE POWER OF GOD, I'M GOING TO SPEAK THINGS INTO EXISTENCE. YEAH. You think you got the solution for the world? I'm going to speak this out of existence. I'm going to solve the world's problems. It's like a grandiose narcissistic thinking like I need to solve everyone's problems so they look at us and see, OH, THE BRIDE OH, THE sons of God. Look at them. How beautiful they are. They're our saviors. We love them. No. You saw what they did with Christ. &gt;&gt; He was all that. &gt;&gt; They hated him. They nashed their teeth at him. They spent night and day conspiring. How are we going to get him? How are we going to kill him? HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE THAT HE'S THIS? HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE THAT HE'S AN that he's a Antichrist? That he's not the Messiah. Can you imagine such men obsessed, you know? Like, man, just take a break. Go do some gardening. &gt;&gt; Go milk THE COWS. THEY'RE SO OBSESSED LIKE THEY ARE TODAY frothing at the mouth, you know, like like foot and mouth disease or something. THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE. IT'S LIKE, LET'S GO HAVE COFFEE AND DISCUSS HOW WE CAN TAKE THEM DOWN. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; It's really maniacal. I don't know. To me, I all these anti- message people. I don't even know what's the big deal. Why not just leave us alone? We don't even make a dent in the world. We're not even like a billion people. We're not even like millions of people. Nobody listens to us. Nobody takes us seriously anymore. And when they see us, they, oh, you're that group. Okay. Nice to see you. Bye. Now, [clears throat] nobody wants to listen to us. We are totally rejected. WE'RE NOT EVEN TRYING TO get into your homes. We're not even trying to live rentree in your heads. What's going on? Why not just let us be? You know, let us be. Let us go away and fade away in our madness like you say. No, they got to go on the internet and blast us and lambaste us and shame us and go take down our churches and call us cults. And we're not even doing anything. We're not even fighting back. It's like every time you beat us, we're just And then you beat us again. I don't understand. Actually, I do. When something convicts you and you know it's right and you know it's nagging at you, you can't let it go. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You have to find a way to prove it wrong for yourself. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. &gt;&gt; We're not pushing it at you. I mean, this this humble man made so many mistakes, grammatical errors. He said some things here this way, another thing here, that way, and this that way, and this prophecy was spoken in this fashion here, and later on he spoke it in this way, slightly different to that. I mean, you could go, you get so exhausted. I'm telling you, sitting with them and talking this out and being an apologist is just the wrong thing to don't even get into that. There's there's absolutely no reason. In fact, if anyone comes up to you and the anti- William Brandham, just say, "Yes, I agree with you." Walk away. Yes, you're right. Wow. And walk away. SHAKE HANDS. GOD BLESS YOU, MAN. You're the greatest. Walk away. That's all. just take the whole poke the balloon and take all the air out because you're not going to get anywhere. THEY ARE TRYING TO fight back to prove it to themselves to make them feel good about the lives they're living because that word is convicting them. &gt;&gt; It's killing them. &gt;&gt; That's just what that's the truth. You young people, anyone when you come to me and question me on the message and the prophet and start to tell me it's false. Believe me, I know what's happening in your head. It's convicting you. You want to do stuff, but you feel like the message is preventing you from doing that's all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is how this is how humans work. &gt;&gt; If they want to do something, you really want to do it, go do it. Go do it. Go see what happens after that. Then come back. We'll still be here. except you'll just come back a little bit dented and cut and bruised and not the same as you you would be if you didn't go there. See that? That's what I'm saying. But when you come to me and start attacking a man of God who dedicated his life to the word who had manifestations of the word of God in his life of the pillar of fire of a whole lot of other things and maybe he spoke in some weird way that doesn't make sense to you and said inconsistent things but you're fighting back against it because it's inconvenient to you then just be honest. say, "I don't I want to do stuff, you know, brother Al. I want to go out and enjoy my life and, you know, I want to get a couple of girlfriends and see how that works out. Go, man. GO HAVE FUN. GO FIND YOURSELF. We'll still be here." I can't tell you how many times it has happened. You know, you get some some young man and tell me, "Oh, brother, I crossed the line." Really? You crossed the line or you want to? You want me to tell you it's okay. You should not be in our church anymore. You want it to be my fault that you leave. Just be a man. Get a spine man. Leave. Say, "I'm I'm making this decision for myself. I'm going. I want to figure it out. I be honest. I'll respect you. But don't come here and make me chase you out so that you can say they chase me out. [clears throat] [snorts] No, we need men. We need real men and women today who can can have a real spine and take responsibility for their actions. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; So the fullness of time means the maximum of times the maturity of times. What does this mean? This means that all this is the dispensation. This dispensation where all the covenants that have not been fulfilled. This is not the dispensation of the fullness of time. This is the dispensation of the fullness of times. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, it's the fullness of the time of Noah, the fullness of the time of Abraham, the fullness of the time of Moses, the fullness of In other words, it's coming to its maximum. All the covenants that were not realized are going to be realized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, the first coming of Christ, the church, all manifestations there in the past, all the covenants are being fulfilled now. This is the fullness of times plural. Amen. Are you are you with me, saints? &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:10 did not say the fullness of time. It said the fullness of times plural. Let's read. Who is this MelkiseDC? All right, buckle your seat belts. This one just puts it all together for us. [clears throat] Notice like the sculpture, he hides with a mask over it. That's what God has done to this age. It's been hid. It's supposed to be revealed in this age. Now, the Bible says they will be revealed in the latter times. It's like a sculptor keeping his piece of work all covered until the time he takes the mask off. And there it is. &gt;&gt; You with us? &gt;&gt; And that's what the Bible has been. It's been a work of God that's been covered up. It's been hid since the foundation of the world. And it's sevenfold mystery. AND GOD PROMISED IN THIS day at the age of this Leodysian age, he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a glorious thing. God and Morphe masked in the pillar of fire. Where are we? Oh, you you changed it. Are we together? Paragraph 43. God and Morphe mosque in the pillar of fire. Got it. &gt;&gt; God and Morphe in a man called Jesus. God and Morphe masked. &gt;&gt; Masked in a man called Jesus. God in morphe in his church and there it is God above us. God with us. God in us the condescending God. Condescending does not mean he looks down on you like the modern. This is the prophet's meaning of condescending means losing a previous state to take on a lower one. To take on a lower one. That's what he means by that. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; So we go back to Ephesians 1:10 which says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ. All right. So did you see? Now I want you to do this when you go back home. Some of you students of the scripture uh and the message go back and look at this previous one which is God above us, God with us, God in us. go and type it into your table or whatever word word searches you have and search for that God above us, God with us, God in us. You will come up with a treasure trove of the same statement with so much more revelation in it. I don't have the time to do it. Maybe one of you can pick it up and preach that those three vers those three phrases, but go have a look at it. So that's why I'm telling you everything I told you is from the message. God [snorts] above, God with us, God in us. You I think there's one quote where it even speaks about God in us becoming manifested sons. &gt;&gt; I I I think it's there. So go have a look at it. Right. So let's go to fullness of times. Gathered together in one all things in Christ. So number one, gather together in one all things in Christ. Now let's go through this quickly. What is gather together? Easy, right? Unite. bring it all together. Gathering. Okay. He's not uniting all things uh uh like uniting all things in Christ. The So the question is what is in Christ? Right? So when we say uniting, most people think of, you know, we're all agreeing, right? That that's like something that never happens. You can never get people all gathered together and agreeing, but you can gather together, right? So, let's bring it all in. What is Christ? Christ is the manifested word, &gt;&gt; the word made flesh. So, what is God doing? He's gathering everything together in the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ means Messiah. The Messiah is the word manifested. So what was the word? The word was the logos who was HAD ALL THE ATTRIBUTES IN HIM, RIGHT? THE ATTRIBUTES OF HIMSELF. SO GOD IS GATHERING all the attributes of himself that were in the logos. He's gathering it together in Christ. That means in the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Sons of God that shouted for joy as attribute form are now coming together in flesh form. They are being gathered together. Not all coming to one place. No one's running to Jeffersonville. No one's running to No. Gathering together means bringing them around the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, we can literally be miles apart, but we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it also means all the attributes to one new revelation of himself. And you can see that Revelations 5, when the lamb took the book, they sang a new song. Is that right? A new song, a new worship, a worship beyond the New Testament. This is the lamb taking the book. A new song is going to be sung because the the book is going to be brought down by the lamb. The seals have been broken off. The Bible becomes a new book. THE MOSQUE IS PULLED OFF. &gt;&gt; Is that right? And that happens right there in that Leodysian church age when that seventh seal is being broke. The mighty angel descends, the seventh seal is open, the book comes down, the mosque is pulled off, seven seals are broken, the book is revealed. Amen. So that one revelation is not by a certain doctrine but by his personal visitation to each believer. Are we together? Why are we together [laughter] in Christ? How is everyone going to get that one revelation? He has to come to each person. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be one brother preaching a certain way or one revelation being preached or series being taught by some person. No, he's going to do this through multiple men in the ministry of Christ. And he is going to visit each individual under all THOSE MINISTRIES. THERE'LL BE OTHERS under those same ministries that will not get it. God will visit each individual who is a part of that and they will be brought together under that one revelation. &gt;&gt; All right, let's look at this highlight the next part of it. Now we go to things which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him. So notice it doesn't say things under the earth on earth, right? He's not bringing those uh under the earth is a phrase meaning the fifth dimension. &gt;&gt; Okay. So we we're not bringing things in that's in the fifth dimension. Things on earth and things which are in heaven. Nothing anymore of Christ in the dimension that was once called under the earth. There is nothing. &gt;&gt; Right? In other words, there's no more bosom of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Got it? There's no paradise in the fifth dimension. There's nothing there anymore. It's all been emptied out. Right? So attributes that were in the what what what are we talking about? The closing of the story of God and man, RIGHT? ALL THE attributes from the beginning through this dispensation have been sown over time. Now we come to the dispensation, the fullness of times where all things must come together. All they without us cannot be made perfect. &gt;&gt; We are now the closing stage. Right? So the attributes that were in the word before the foundation of the world have been expressed on earth some were taken up to heaven which are the heavenly attributes still there as well as the attributes of him the bridegroom himself. Then there are attributes of the word who are in living vessels on earth right now. So that which is in heaven during this dispensation that comes to earth by the opening of the seventh seal with the attributes of the bridegroom, those attributes of the saints of old, those who died before us. They are basically the word that was manifested in the past. Some of them were foreshadows of Christ. Some of them came after Christ and have died. He's bringing them all together in one by the opening of the seventh seal by the mighty angel descending in him. It ends within him which is in the logos that began it all. He was heaven. He became earth. They are now attributes in heaven who have lived through the times and being called on by him. God has taken them home. But in the dispensation of the fullness of times there will there will uh the last attributes on earth for the completion of all things in Christ. That's where we are right now. Gathering all things together in him means bringing all the attributes in the revealed word for that dispensation. It is a new ruling system of governance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is new governance. &gt;&gt; Amen. The government shall be upon his shoulder. He is good about the paps. No longer about the loins. &gt;&gt; He's now good about the paps. He's the judge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's a new system of government. When we say that, do you realize we are no longer the church? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I no longer call you church. I call you bride. So you understand what what's different about the church? We are not just the called out ones anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not just people who are keeping traditions of Christianity and and keeping of footwashing and communion and keeping of of ordinances of baptisms and and all kinds of traditions and things. WE'RE NOT JUST ABOUT THAT. There's new ordinance. There's new governance because you are being brought into equality with him. You are not in the place of intercession for ignorance anymore. Big difference. Okay, let's bring this to a conclusion by talking about the predestinated behavior. Okay. Basically what happened uh is each attribute expressed a certain behavior on earth. In the time of Moses, in the time of Adam, in the time of Christ, in the time of the church ages, each attribute produced a certain behavior. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Okay. And that behavior WAS MANIFESTED BY THE attribute &gt;&gt; in the person through the revealed word. In other words, so there you have this person. He's got an attribute in him. He only starts responding when the word for the day is preached. &gt;&gt; Because the attribute responds to the word. &gt;&gt; If the attribute doesn't have the word, the person just goes about doing what everybody else does. &gt;&gt; But once the word is spoken, THE ATTRIBUTE COMES ALIVE. THE ATTRIBUTE begins to manifest. Now that same person who came from his bloodline, his lineage, it could be German, French, Zulu, Shauna, whatever you are, wherever you come from, Indian, white, European, I don't care where you from, YOU START TO DENY THOSE THINGS. YOU START TO DENY WHERE you came from and you start MANIFESTING WHAT'S IN THE ATTRIBUTE. &gt;&gt; That means it produces a behavior. &gt;&gt; Yes. a new behavior. So it takes a revealed word coming. Do you agree? You cannot get the new behavior unless the word comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Let's read in adoption message the predestinated behavior. Paragraph 74 7 page 74 paragraph 72. Now placing the son you with me. First thing after the son was in he become a son. But then we find out his behavior is what set him to adoption whether he behaved right or not. So what is the right behavior? The right behavior is not taught by law cood. It's not taught the right behavior for this last time is not right with regards to morals or standards. It never was. It's right by predestinated purpose. The predestinated behavior in Noah's day was waking up every day to go build that ark. The right behavior didn't tell him whether to drink coffee or not, whether to sleep longer, whether to speak nicely to his wife after she made breakfast, whether to speak nicely to his sons to encourage them to work, whether to No, it had nothing to do with what was morally right or it had to DO WITH THE PURPOSE OF BUILDING the ark. &gt;&gt; That's when that word is brought, it produces a behavior. The man doesn't know what's rain. He doesn't know what's flood. He's never seen it in his life. But he's he's got a behavior on him. An urgency to build this ark believing there's going to be rains and floods that's going TO DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD. There's no way he can put that behavior on himself. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's right only because it produces the will for this day. What is the behavior for you for this day? Okay. So achieving the behavior, I just want to I just want to give you some hope. Before we close it down, watch this master teacher Paul. The first thing he does is knock out all the idea of falling away. Glory to God. The you notice what I tell the youth when you come and you you messed up your life or whatever, the first thing you need in your mind is I am a son of God. HELL IS NOT AN OPTION for me. There's no way I'm going to hell. &gt;&gt; That's where you start, right? &gt;&gt; First thing Paul does is knock out the idea of falling away. He says, "Knock out all the idea of being a Christian today and tomorrow I'm gone and the next day God condemned me and the next day I'm back again." That's nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amen. This book is not addressed to evangelistic teaching, evangelistic sermons. We don't I don't touch this on a field. I bring this to the church for Paul addressed it to the saints. Those who are called, those that are called and preserved are filled and are set aside and are in the Holy Spirit already in Canaan's land. Are you with me? HE'S TRYING TO TELL them the first thing, get it out of your mind that you're going to get lost. You're going to do this. You're scared of this. Don't be scared of nothing. For he's trying to tell you where you're at, who you are, how you're standing, saints. There's no way you can put this behavior on you. Unless the word is revealed to you that you are the bride, you will not have this. Right? Notice how hard he goes on this and is against the spirit. He calls it nonsense. And this is what I want to tell you. The story of GOD AND MAN. I AM A SON OF GOD. Hell cannot hold me. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE PLACE WILL BLOW UP. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE I am. THAT'S WHERE I STAND. HELL CANNOT HOLD ME. THE GATES won't even let me in. The son of God has nothing to fear. No matter what happens, he knows that he has been chosen. There can be no doubt about his purpose. SO BEFORE YOU CAN EVEN START taking your land, get rid of that kind of nonsense thinking. There is no falling away for the children of God. Sure, you're going to make mistakes. There's something for that. How can you preach predestination of God for ordaining and setting unless there's a sin atonement somewhere? Why is it each day you make a mistake, each day you do wrong? But if you're born again, man or woman, AS SOON AS YOU MAKE A MISTAKE, God knows you're sorry for it. Before you apologize, BEFORE YOU REPENT, BEFORE YOU MAKE IT RIGHT, God already knows you're sorry for it. You can stand in the presence of President Roosevelt or anyone else and say, "I'm wrong. God forgive me for this thing." Why? That's where the blood of torment. You notice that sins, a sinner is a sinner. He does not commit sins. But the church commits sin, does wrong, gets a wrong thought, wrong impression, makes scruples, wobbles like a little child walking, try to learn uh uh how to walk. You don't know how to walk good yet cuz he's a little little boy. But we have a hand that reaches down. And if he gets us and steadies us and says, "Make the step away, son." He doesn't pick us up and spank us because we made a mistake. That was law age. HE DOESN'T BEAT US TO DEATH because we're trying to walk. He loves us like we love our children. He knows you have preferred. He knows you. He knows your life. He knows you would have preferred not to make mistakes. He knows you didn't want to do those wrong things. You didn't want TO MESS UP. HE KNOWS THAT. HE KNOWS YOUR HEART. HE KNOWS THE SEED. He knows the gene. He knows what your intentions are. His grace already made a way for all those THINGS WHEN HE CHOSE YOU. &gt;&gt; HE CHOSE you knowing YOU WOULD MAKE A MISTAKE TOMORROW. &gt;&gt; You still need to come to that understanding. You cannot come to equality while you can still believe I'm going to fall away. &gt;&gt; There's no equality there. like I still need intercession. You're never going to lose your place, sons of and daughters of God. You're never going to lose your place in his purpose. You're not going to lose your promise for this age. You will certainly pay for the things you've done wrong. You will pay for it here and now. And that's good for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read now. You might do things wrong. Paragraph 36, adoption part three. You might do things WRONG AND EVERY TIME you do anything wrong, you're going to get paid for it. I told you everything I say to you is in the message. Yes, sir. You'll reap what you sow. So, stop complaining about the bad things. Okay? Some of the bad things you brought on yourself, some of the bad things he's making you pay for something. In all things, give thanks. BUT THAT HAS NOT ONE THING TO DO WITH YOUR SALVATION. &gt;&gt; THE FACT listen saints, you may have done something really bad. Maybe you killed someone and you have to go to jail. Yeah. You go to jail. You get beat up in jail. You stand your ground there. You learn your lesson. You be the bride of Christ in jail. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I'm just giving you like the maximum thing. I hope you never kill anyone. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT WHATEVER IT IS, IF GOD HAS CHOSEN YOU FOR THAT, I KNOW of brothers who got allowed to go into prison so that he could use them there to spread the gospel. I've heard plenty of those stories, right? God can make you sick so you can spend one month or two months in a hospital in a hospital bed suffering with other people. While in your suffering, you are now talking to all these other people about the word. You're paying for something and you're continuing your purpose. &gt;&gt; This how it works with a child of God. Amen. In all things give thanks. You're a part of God. You're a son of God. When you're born in the spirit of God, you got eternal life and can no more die than God can die. &gt;&gt; You best stop BELIEVING THIS. YOU BEST START BELIEVING in the story of God and man. Embrace it. I was born of Brandom. He says, "You might make me some other name, some other name, but won't make me one less. I'm still Brandham. I was born Brham. Always will be Brandham. I may be so disfigured someday, drawed with arthritis, have a wreck, that's a car accident, or all tore up till I look an animal, but I'll still be a Brandham. Why? Brandom's bloods on the inside. [clears throat] What's he saying? I came into this world. He saved me. He gave me the Holy Ghost. He put his token upon me. His life, he revealed his word to me, opened the seals, and let me see it. I might break down. I might lose family members. I MIGHT HAVE CHILDREN BACKSLIDE. MY WIFE MIGHT leave me. I might end up all dead and withered looking and funny and everyone rejecting me. It doesn't take away the promise. &gt;&gt; No matter what I end up looking like, there's still his blood that's in me. &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. No matter what happens to us in life, because we have his life in us, we will we will certainly fulfill his word and bring forth the purpose he chose us for. He will not he will not compromise that behavior. Right? A son of God will not compromise that behavior. In this generation, you have to have the right behavior because it will be revealed by him through his word. Let's let's cut out all the noise. You can't be the bride and have the behavior of denomination. Yes, [clears throat] &gt;&gt; that's that's not the behavior of the gene seed of this day. You you you find it happening now in the message where message people want to go back to the behavior of denomination. And I I don't just mean the way they sing and worship. I mean literally in their minds they're becoming organized religion again. You can't do that. The theme of this message that the prophet taught was this particular thing. He was trying to tell people that organized religion will never be right and never help the elect find the right predestinated behavior. In other words, let's let's make it all plain. If you're if you have organized religion, you'll never wake up thinking, I need to build that ark. You got your own idea. If you have organized religion as your guiding nature, you'll never wake up in the morning thinking, I need to kill Goliath or I need to take God's people across to the promised land or I need to protect God's throne or I need to, you know, I want to ask you because my wife and I ask ourselves this all the time. You know, we we bluff ourselves. We delude ourselves. We go for coffee and dessert. We go away for our anniversary and we go to have a break and we go there and we try to unwind and uh we even get out in nature where there's no cell phones and Wi-Fi network and then we sitting on this table and our conversation comes back to the condition this world is in. Sometimes I ask what is WRONG WITH US? WHY ARE we concerned with THE BEHAVIOR OF OTHER PEOPLE? Why can we not get it out of US TO JUST LIKE SHUT IT OUT AND just have peace? No, we just can't get out of us, can we? Because that's that gene seed inside. &gt;&gt; It's egging at you. &gt;&gt; It It's making you concerned. It's making you cry out for the abominations of the city. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you can try to run from it. Every time you see something, you read something, you see some clip on something on YouTube, it's it's it's drawing your attention to the sin that is mounting in the world and it's drawing your conversation. There's something inside you thinking, "What can I do? What must we do? What do we do to prevent this from happening to our children? HOW DO WE KEEP THIS OUT OF OUR CHURCH? HOW DO WE KEEP THE word pure?" Like, who died and made you God? &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; There's an answer for that, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like, what makes you think you can save the world? &gt;&gt; What makes you think you can even do it one soul at A TIME? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT BECAUSE of the way you live, there'll be salvation for mankind? Are you a narcissist? [clears throat] What makes you Why CAN YOU NOT GET THAT OUT OF YOUR BEING? WHY ARE YOU LETTING it drive your work, your school, your life? WHY ARE YOU PRAYING TO GOD? Why are you read the Bible? Why are you READING THE MESSAGE? WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO MAKE as much money as all those other people and and HAVE A A BLAST OF A PARTY OF A LIFE UNTIL YOU breathe your last breath and then you can die thinking, "Yes, I did everything. I spent every SCENT AND I ENJOYED IT." WHY CAN'T YOU JUST be that? No, you're concerned with the world and the way they're acting and the way the the the country is going, the way the world at large is is behaving and what's happening to the youth and what's happening to the universities, what's happening to the children and and you're going out there and you're doing stuff with the public and you're trying to change things. Why paragraph 97 adoption part three why I stood not long ago by the grave of a man great man a great reformer and I thought what a great man he was it was John Wesley and I thought if John Wesley could rise from this grave today and see the condition of his church he'd be ashamed of his name &gt;&gt; John Wesley was a godly man a fire brand snatched as he called it. John Wesley was a holy man who lived in God, believed in God, and walked step by step after him. [clears throat] Yeah. Uh but after John died, they said, "We'll make a church to John so we'll have a church and we'll call it Methodist church because of his method of sanctification being the second work of grace." Then they made a church and today them church men deny everything that John Wesley stood for. John Wesley preached divine healing. John Wesley believed in the baptism of the spirit. John Wesley believed in all the restoration of the gifts. John Wesley, Martin Luther, many of those great men spoke in tongues and interpreted. And today you speak in tongues in a Methodist church or Lutheran church that kick you out the door. What's the matter? Right in the time where we ought to be placing sons, what is the matter? They have adopted something else because they don't know the mystery of God. Stop. Wake up. Don't miss it. They've adopted something else because they don't know the mystery of God. They'll know it. They'll never know it through a seminary. He was speaking this in 1960, not realizing 65 years later the very same thing would be said about him. William Brham. So I'll say it. If William Brham rose from the grave to see what is being done in his name today, he would be ashamed of his name. There are many things taught in his name that are not the things he stood for. Making cults, subjugating people like slaves, ruling people's lives by force of terror, of supernatural terror. forcing people into behaviors and things and doctrines that are not in congruent then they are not congruent with what he taught not even in THE SAME SPIRIT NOT EVEN IN THE SAME humility right in the time I'll I'll use his words right in the time where we ought to be placing sons what is the matter they have adopted something else because they don't know the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; There it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; But saints, the word has come down. You know, I I don't know what it was like to be that prophet. But I can tell you from what I read, I remember once preaching the message to you when we started the series on the seven thunders. I preached something. Did I call it the prophet in distress? or something. What was it called? Something to that effect. But I remember running through the mindset of the prophet leading up to the seventh seal after receiving that that vision. Insist the time and the turmoil. Was it turmoil? in &gt;&gt; the prophet in turmoil. And it literally was turmoil because from the word go of that vision, he couldn't figure out what God wanted for him to do. He he actually thought he was going to die and he heard he saw this blast and all that and he's thinking, is it the thunders? Is it this? Is it that? And he went through turmoil. And then he goes through January and February and March and then he comes to preach the seventh seal. And look at the things he's got to say. I mean, can you imagine me saying today? Me. Okay, I'm going to say this. It's time to say everything. Especially for my legalist brothers all over the world who say, "Say what the tape says. SAY ONLY WHAT DO NOT ADD or take away. [snorts] Can you show me one quote where brother Brandham says I am the seventh messenger? [cough and clears throat] Can you show me one quote where he says I am the forerunner. I am the Elijah. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; So why do you believe that? Are you adding to the word? Oh, no. You got a revelation. Oh, that's convenient. Now it's convenient because you're not saying what the tape says. &gt;&gt; Even those press PLAY TAPE GUYS. THEY'RE ALSO SAYING HE'S ELIJAH. He's a forerunner. HE'S THE PROPHET. HE'S THIS. WHERE does he say that? Everywhere he talks, HE SPEAKS LIKE JOHN THE BAPTIST. when that seventh angel we know he will DO THIS WHEN THAT ELIJAH EVEN SAYS IN some place he's Christ. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So what did you guys add to it? Because now you're saying he's the seventh messenger and he didn't say it. OH, HE SAID SOMETHING TO ALLUDE TO IT that he is but he didn't say it. You legalist. You see this is a problem. Now when you when you take that and you go back to all the THINGS HE HAD TO SAY in the seventh seal like saying the seventh angel is on earth at the time of this coming. &gt;&gt; So those fellas who are legalists about what he said if if he is coming has not happened yet that means he's not talking about the seventh angel that is him. He's talking about the seven trumpeting angel. So we can now twist the words to be legalistic about that. In the meantime, can you imagine the weight on him to have to say that he is a son of man revealing the son of man and the full revealed to him under the seventh seal is that he is speaking for the lamb. Would you have the guts to say that? &gt;&gt; How would you say that? That's why I'm saying the pressure. I just thank God it's not me. &gt;&gt; That's how I feel. &gt;&gt; I'm just happy to be me, Lord. To have that pressure and to have to say that where by the end of the series, he even says, "I'm going to lose 10,000 of my friends because of this. I'm going to lose my friends. Doors are going to be closed. to me. Don't worry, brothers. Let it thunder. It's fine. The word has come down, saints, and made a new unconditional covenant. Do you know in this dispensation of the fullness of times is the last unconditional covenant? &gt;&gt; That is made. Oh, you're going to love this. Revelations 10:4-7. So you know in Revelations 10 1-3, right? &gt;&gt; And a mighty angel descends from heaven in a cloud and a rainbow about his head and and uh his face like the sun, right? And verse four says, are everyone awake? &gt;&gt; I I know your eyes are open. I mean, are you awake? Okay. When the seven thunders uttered their voices, I was about to write. Who's the eye? It's John. John is a type of the believer. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not." That means don't reveal it yet. &gt;&gt; That's what sealing up means. Like when it says in Daniel, "Seal up the words, Daniel, unto the end." &gt;&gt; It means don't reveal it, right? Don't interpret it. Don't tell them what it means. That is ceiling. And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven. By the way, this is where the courts get it from. Raise your hand. Place your hand in the Bible because raising the hand was a symbol of something. What? Swearing an oath. Making a covenant and swear by him. Okay. [clears throat] Little children in South Africa, don't tell me the angel swore. Okay? Because in South Africa, swearing here is cursing. This is not cursing. This swearing is making a promise. So he raised his hand and made a promise. He made a covenant. He swore an oath, right? And then he swore by him that liveth forever and ever. Brother Brandham says, "Because there was none higher than him to swear by, he swore by himself." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? When people make covenants or sign contracts, they need a guarantor. You know what's a guarantor? In case your word fails, someone else pays your debt, right? That's a guarantor. So, uh, if you swear by something, you got to swear by something reliable. Right? Like some of you fellas, Indian fellows who swear by your mother. [clears throat] Right? Do not do that. We actually have a scripture in Christ that says that do not swear by your mother or your father. Do not swear by heaven nor by earth. None of those things belong to you. It's not going to back you up. Do not swear by anything. With Christ, he says, "Do not swear by anything. Let your yay be yay and your nay be nay." So you don't have to make any promises. Right? But he has to come and make a covenant because we are unbelieving, untrusting people, nervous, suspicious people. THAT'S WHY GOD IS TO COME MAKE COVENANTS. Like when he came and made a promise, Abraham would say, "How shall I know? How shall I know that I will receive this?" And then God is to produce something to make a promise. Are you with us? Okay, we closing now. We're coming to the end. So the angel descends. He raises his right hand. He swears by him that liveth forever and ever. And look at the things. And who created heaven [clears throat] and the things that are in heaven. No. Amens. And earth and the things that are in earth and the sea and the things which are therein which is still earth. And that there should be time no longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's making a covenant. He's making a promise. He's swearing by the highest oath of authority OF OATHS THAT THERE SHOULD BE TIME NO LONGER. Everyone got that? &gt;&gt; Oh great. What what kind of promise is that? It's going to be no more time. Thank you. No verse seven, right? Verse seven is the actual thing. Looks like I didn't put it here in the notes. This is the oath that in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound &gt;&gt; the what? The mystery of God &gt;&gt; which they did not know. &gt;&gt; THEY ADOPTED SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE they didn't know the mystery of God. THE MYSTERY OF GOD should be finished. &gt;&gt; AS HE HATH DECLARED TO HIS SERVANTS THE PROPHETS, SAINTS, follow the mystery. The angel descends with the open book in his hand. He places one foot on the land, one in the sea. He cries with a loud voice. Seven thunders utter their voices not interpreted because there's a message that needs to be received. Then he commands that what the seven thunders uttered should not be made known or revealed or interpreted. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S SOMETHING OUTSTANDING that needs to be revealed. &gt;&gt; So, he raises his hand and swears [clears throat] that everything that should not be revealed is going to be fulfilled when the seventh ANGEL IS GIVING OUT HIS MESSAGE, THE MYSTERY OF GOD SHOULD BE FINISHED. &gt;&gt; He references the name he swears by, that is him that liveth forever and ever, who created heaven and earth AND ALL THINGS. WHO'S THAT? Sunday school, the logos. [snorts] He's referencing the logos, right? The word where the story of God and man began. HE SAYS, "AND WHO CREATED everything in heaven and in earth and in the sea in the ancient ways of swearing oaths and covenants." This is one what one had to do. Raise your right hand and swear by someone higher than you. We know because the very next chapter details when he says time shall be no more. It's not the ending of time because the next chapter says there's three and a half years left. &gt;&gt; Time times and half a time left for the Jews. He's not talking about time ending. He's talking about dispensation. &gt;&gt; THE DISPENSATION is ending. &gt;&gt; TIME SHALL BE NO MORE. SO WHAT COVENANT DOES he make? That is verse seven. That in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery of God should be finished. As declared by the prophets of all the other dispensations. &gt;&gt; This is the dispensation of the fullness of time. This is beautiful. Let's read. Is this a sign of the end, sir? Okay. He begins by reading a scripture. The book that is written within is then completed and all these mysteries have finished to be sounded. Now, let me read it again. So you will be sure. Now look, there it is. In the days of the voice of the seventh angel, he says, "Last angel." This is where the bride needs to wake up and and understand who's he talking about. He's saying me without saying it. When he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished. Now, what is the mystery of God? Are you ready? One of them Paul said in 1 Timothy 3, I believe it was said without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness. What is the mystery of God? For God was manifested in the flesh. He is now defining the mystery of God. God manifested in the flesh. We handled him. We seed him. Received him up into glory. Witnessed by angels. Vindicated here on earth. God was [cough and clears throat] what is the mystery of God? God manifested in flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the mystery rejected in the time of Christ. That is the mystery rejected under the seventh seal. That is the mystery being rejected now. THEY ADOPTED SOMETHING ELSE CUZ THEY don't know the mystery of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure, it's a great mystery, but it's all solved. Not father, son, and holy ghost, three gods, but one God in three offices. The father under Moses, the sunship under Christ, the Holy Ghost under this dispensation, three dispensations of the same God, not three gods. The mystery is finished now. THE BIBLE SAID it should be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't want to talk on a mystery of God because I've done it already. How many of you remember the message I preached called the purpose of the message 2013 2014 somewhere? You remember that? I went through all these dispensations and we showed you that scripture where it says the the mystery of God and he speaks of the father, the word, the holy spirit. You remember we did all the dispensations, right? The purpose of the message. So I'm not going to go into that. We have covered that sufficiently in the seventh seal. The mystery of the book sealed with seven seals. But this is the final covenant. SAINTS, LET'S WAKE UP. THIS IS THE FINAL COVENANT under this dispensation IN THE FULLNESS OF TIMES. The dispensation OF THE FULLNESS OF TIMES. This is your covenant that the mystery of God SHOULD BE FINISHED. I'M saying to you, don't be like people who read things on a surface level. What does it mean? Like what does Mrs. Jesus mean? I'm asking you, what does the mystery of God mean? Don't point to Jesus. Don't point to the prophet YOUR DAY. WHAT IS the mystery of God? What is God manifested in flesh? Which flesh? What flesh? When is that going to happen? This is the final covenant. I'm saying to you, every other covenant was not completed because the people failed. This is the DISPENSATION OF THE FULLNESS OF ALL COVENANTS. &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE NO FAILURE BECAUSE THERE'S NO MORE DISPENSATION TO COMPLETE THIS MYSTERY. You are the ones chosen TO COMPLETE THE STORY OF GOD AND MAN, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God MADE FLESH TODAY. YOU ARE THE ONES CHOSEN. IT'S YOUR STRUGGLE, your trial to come to that acceptance. &gt;&gt; What those seven thunders uttered is unsealed in our day. It is unveiled. It is revealed. It is all coming together in Christ in one. It is heaven and earth embracing two dimensions becoming one. Theophony is coming together WITH THE FLESHLY BODIES. IT'S HAPPENING TO GLORIFY THE FLESH. ALL PREDESTINATED ATTRIBUTES BOTH WHICH ARE IN HEAVEN, those which are in earth are coming together completing the mystery of God. We have been chosen for this dispensation. Many people will falter, many will fail, but those who are chosen will not fail. They will reach their adoption. We will find our positions in Christ. This dispensation is the ushering in of the millennium. &gt;&gt; THERE CAN BE NO MILLENNIUM if this dispensation of THE FULLNESS OF TIMES DID NOT HAPPEN FIRST. &gt;&gt; WE HAD TO BRING ALL THINGS IN CHRIST IN HEAVEN AND IN EARTH TOGETHER before all THINGS IN CHRIST CAN BE TOGETHER IN flesh in uh for for a thousand years for the millennium. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is his purpose for us in the dispensation of the fullness of times. In closing, the last quote, he's reading uh Ephesians 1, the mysteries of his will according to his good pleasure. Back over now again in Ephesians 9 uh which he has purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times. And remember that we just passed over it Ephesians 1st 10th verse that in the dispensation of the fullness of time. Now we learned that the fullness of time uh the time that that when sin will cease. The fullness of time is waiting for what? The fullness of all time. The time when sin uh will cease. The time when death will cease. The time when sickness will cease. THE TIME WHEN SIN will cease. THE TIME WHEN ALL PERVERSIONS AND PERVERTED things that the devil has perverted will cease. When time itself shall cease. You know this is a beautiful thing. I taught you once before. God took Israel, allowed them to go to Egypt in a famine and kept them there 400 years while the fullness of the Amorites is fulfilled. When it's fulfilled, he then takes them out, plagues that place to chase them out AND GO FULFILL THEIR PURPOSE TO CLEANSE the land of the Amorites. This where you are. You and I could not complete completely overcome sin unless sin comes to its maximum, right? [snorts] &gt;&gt; You have to fight it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. in the year in the 1970s with all the Woodstock and LSD and drugs and cannabis smoking hippies who grew out their beards and their hair and dressed crazy with dyed clothes and sang weird songs and save the world and make love not war and you know they were all I and we thought that was sinful and then the 80s came and then you had one of the first stars of Hollywood die of AIDS and the world Christian world went into you know slap bang against homosexuality and AIDS being caused by homosexuality. Nobody back then I was living then in the 80s. Nobody back then would imagine what the world was going to be like now. Then the '9s came and we thought, "Yeah, it can't get any worse than this." And then everyone thought the world was going to end in 2000. You remember the whole Y2K thing and they were stocking up cans of beans and you know what? Oh, everything was going to switch, you know, to [snorts] 2000 and the zeros. I don't know what the zeros were going to do, but they were going to crash the whole world systems and we're ALL GOING TO DIE. I REMEMBER I WAS WORKING AT Eskim at the time. Eskim was planning for Y2K, setting all their systems and when it switches over on all the zeros, nothing happened. Nothing happened. That year 2001, the World Trade Center came down in a terrorist attack and then all the systems of the world world trade came crashing down. From there on when all these look like cloak and dagger stuff, you know, with with economies and insuranceances and investments and banks and we went through these decades and everyone's thinking, how much worse can it get? If you think of sexual immorality, you you people are living under an illusion. If if you have only an inkling of an idea, I cannot even speak it across this pulpit because it's so bad to tell you what is there. I spoke to a a young message youth who [snorts] said to me, "Brother Alistister, it is not fair what has been put in our hands. It is not fair to me in this message today to have access to the things I have access to. [crying] It is not fair." He said, "If you guys thought you were dealing with things in your your time," he said, "what's happening to us, it is not fair. [snorts] I'm going to say something that he said." He said, "A young person, a young child in America today," he's from America. He was talking to me from he said to me, "A young boy, teenager in 10 minutes using his cell phone would see more naked women in full HD than an English king in his whole lifetime." Those were his words to me. He's right. He said in 10 minutes if you think of the amount of scrolling you do on your cell phone and the amount of stuff you consume on the internet today and what our kids what I'm trying to tell you is if you thought you were ready to meet the rapture in the 80s or the '9s you were deluded. &gt;&gt; Sin had the Amorites had not even come to its fullness yet. So my friends, my brothers and sisters, my young people, Sunday school youth, this is your trial. I don't care how hard it is. You have to face it. You have to battle it. You have to beat it. I don't care how unfair it is to your generation. Those people who are being fed to lions must have been saying the same thing. It's unfair to me that I'm being fed to the lions. I'm not This young boy was not saying this in a way to me that was complaining. He was trying to bring me to the understanding that our generation of adults does not have the full comprehension of the the issue that the youth today face. And to me, I've got ministers shooting me in the back while I'm trying to bring them to the idea of what is going on. They [snorts] don't even want to talk about it. I've got ministers who say their wives can't hear the message I preached on sexuality cuz it's too much for them. They blush at it. And I spoke those things in a way that is even diplomatic. It's not even what your children are seeing. I mean, if your wife blushes at what I said, she'll just have a coronery and die. &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you, stop being such pruds. &gt;&gt; Stop acting like it doesn't exist. STOP ACTING LIKE YOU CAN'T TALK about it. Stop acting LIKE YOU'RE SO HOLY that it doesn't happen in your generation or in your own house. Don't walk around like ostriches with your head stuck in the sand. Don't for one second think your child is not exposed to it. YOU'RE A FOOL IF YOU think so. And just because you can take them to camps and get them to to receive some Holy Ghost anointing and shout and scream and run around and think, "Ah, we did our job. We did our job. You know, now the Holy Ghost can take it from here." No, parents, no. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. You're going to have to fight this. &gt;&gt; YES, &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING to have to fight this. And look, half of it is not my battle. I don't have the time to go surfing for pornography on the internet. It's It's not going to happen for me. It's not even my fight. I don't even have 10 minutes to to look around for naked women. I got barely 10 minutes for myself. I can't even get time to to exercise. got a hurting back because they don't exercise. But you have got time on your hand. You have got idle minds. You young minds are getting involved in all these things. There are games, there are computer games, there's pornography, there's scrolling on THE INTERNET, ALL THE STUFF YOU DO. Let me tell you what happens when you have a spirit that is not centered on the word. It poisons your entire being. You cannot tell me that if you're you're reading one book for a whole year while YOU'RE CONSUMING ALL THE internet &gt;&gt; that you'll have a spirit that can fight this fight. No, it's not happening. that in the dispensation of the fullness of time that he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and earth, which are on earth, even in him. Gather all things in Christ. As I said this morning, all the little nuggets that we find, these great little things, you can polish them in Genesis, you can polish them in Exodus, you can polish them in Leviticus, you can bring them up in Revelations, they'll end up being Jesus. Can you see that? &gt;&gt; All the covenants, no matter what, you can polish them up, they will end up in Jesus. Right? You take Joseph, you take Abraham, you take Isaac, you take Jacob, you take David, you take any of those nuggets, those men of God, and see if they don't see Jesus displayed in each one of them that he might gather all things into one Christ Jesus. It's all going to come to this time at the end. All those that were written of in the Bible were displaying earthly attributes of the word in every dispensation. But it all comes back to Christ in the end. What is Christ? The mystery of God revealed. What is the mystery of God? The word manifested in flesh. &gt;&gt; The logos and all those ATTRIBUTES THAT WERE IN THE FOUNDATION IN THE FOUNTAIN of life manifested in flesh today. All that was in the logos before the foundation of the world in the beginning of the story of God a man is now manifested according to the pleasure of his own will. Manifested in the flesh through Jesus Christ. ALL THOSE ATTRIBUTES WERE CHOSEN TO BE manifested in the flesh. To do what? To combat the evil for their day. To fight back against the lies of that time. To bring restoration to mankind in their time. THERE IS NO difference to this day. YOU WILL NOT hear in the message to come to me churches and have a comfortable life and coast along while everything must go right for you. No. IF THE ATTRIBUTES HAD TO COMBAT sin in every GENERATION AND FIGHT THE GREATEST pharaohs and kings and rulers and empires AND THE MOST BLOODTHIRSTY EMPIRES THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES, THEN IN THIS DAY, what is a little bit of criticism? What is a LITTLE BIT OF BACKBITING AND SNIPING at you or people CALLING YOU NAMES? WHAT IS PEOPLE CALLING YOU CULTS? THAT'S NOT EVEN IT. THE STORY OF GOD IN MAN IS ABOUT GOD'S WORD BEING MANIFESTED IN FLESH. IT IS HERE FOR THE SALVATION OF MANKIND. It is here TO FULFILL THE PURPOSE THAT GOD created man for to be dominant TO TAKE DOMINION OVER ALL SIN. That's what we have been called for. The logos is heaven. He has brought brought forth sons like unto himself. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; The logos brought forth sons like unto himself. What was that? Theophanes. &gt;&gt; THEN THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH IN JESUS CHRIST. AND HE BROUGHT FORTH sons like unto himself. &gt;&gt; So you HAVE SONS BROUGHT FORTH LIKE UNTO HIMSELF IN HEAVEN AND IN EARTH WHO must come together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the last dispensation of the fullness of times. Heaven and earth embracing theophony and flesh equals manifested sons. We are living at the end of the story. You are the end of the story &gt;&gt; of God and man. You are the fulfillment of it. We went through the beautiful journey of the whole story. But you are now the end of the story. &gt;&gt; You are the fulfillment of the very thoughts in God's mind that he wanted to see. And it's you. I could make real, you know, flattering words and poetry to tell you how great you are and how wonderful it is that God chose you and talk about where you came from and the sheep coat and the and the poor humble families you came from and the nothings you once were and how you have been. I COULD DO THAT. I COULD really inspire you with with telling you things of how wonderful it is and how good his grace is and and we could HAVE A HALLELUJAH SHOUTING JUBILEE ABOUT THE blood of Christ and the salvation and the Holy Ghost he's given YOU AND THE GIFTS HE'S GIVEN YOU TO PREACH AND to speak AND ALL OF THAT. I COULD I COULD FILL YOUR SPIRITS RIGHT NOW with such inspiration. But you have a purpose to fulfill. You have to fight this enemy of this day. You are the ones chosen to overcome it. You have to show the manifested word in this time. You have to show the word made flesh. You have to face the enemy on every realm. And there's no hiding from it. Church is not a place to hide from it. When things go bad, do not stand back and blame the church. Do not stand black back and blame the ministry. If if you are a person not even reading the word in a single year, how can you blame the church or the ministry? They're doing their job. Right? WHEN YOU GET SICK AND YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S HEALING, you have to fight it. You have to deal with it. YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT GOD MIGHT CALL YOU HOME THROUGH IT. YOU HAVE TO STILL SHOW FAITH right through to the end. You have to face up to it, saints. This is the mystery of God [snorts] made flesh, manifested in our day. And we are the end of the story. Amen. And if the Bible was still being written today, it would be your lives being written. It would be your story being written. Amen. Unfortunately, you know, I feel like maybe you guys should write write some books. The Epis of Mark, blessed be the saints from Durban and greetings to the saints and so and so on. Blessings and grace and this and that. N be to you. I tell you these things that God has done in my life. These things I say to you by the Holy Ghost. Oh yes. Wax as poetic as you can. Write. Tell your story. Testify. Be a witness. I don't I'm just being dramatic. But uh I I I love it. I love poetry. I love the word of God. I love the Bible. I love the message. I've come to a stage in my life where I cannot even read anything else. I cannot even concentrate on something I'm reading anymore because it just bores me. I feel dead if I read something. If it's not even something to do with the word, it's just it's just like dying itself. My brain dies instantly. I go, [gasps] I can't cope anymore. I just got to see the truth of God for this day. I can't look at a newspaper and look at the headlines and put it away. Newspapers are collecting in my house for when we need to clean up something. It's terrible, right? We are thirsting for the truth and let's find that truth. The Lord bless you. Let's bow our heads together.
