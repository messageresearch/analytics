[0:00] Amen. While we're standing, let's turn
[0:02] in our Bibles
[0:05] or you can follow on the screen.
[0:08] Ephesians chapter 2
[0:11] 4-10.
[0:14] Ephesians 2 4-10.
[0:18] Amen. It says, "But God, who is rich in
[0:21] mercy, for his great love wherewith he
[0:25] loved us, even when we were dead in
[0:28] sins, hath quickened us together with
[0:31] Christ.
[0:33] by grace you are saved and hath raised
[0:37] us up together and made us sit together
[0:39] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that
[0:43] in the ages to come he might show the
[0:47] exceeding riches of his grace in his
[0:49] kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
[0:53] For by grace are you saved through faith
[0:56] and that not of yourselves. It is the
[1:00] gift of God, not of works, lest any man
[1:03] should boast. For we are his
[1:05] workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[1:08] unto good works, which God hath before
[1:11] ordained that we should walk in them.
[1:15] Amen. The Lord added blessing to his
[1:16] word. You may be seated.
[1:20] So this morning we want to continue with
[1:23] our series, the story of God and man.
[1:26] And once again, this is the story of God
[1:28] and man, part four. And um it's things
[1:32] I've preached before in different ways
[1:35] and of course without the technology and
[1:37] everything and but was very much
[1:40] inspired by the Sunday school and the
[1:43] youth and um the fact that there are
[1:46] several of our young people and and
[1:49] people who want to be baptized.
[1:52] So I know the usual tradition is someone
[1:55] asks to be baptized and you just take
[1:57] them and dunk them in the water. Like
[1:58] there's no time like the present. But I
[2:01] and I believe that but I don't uh I also
[2:04] believe the prophet said that before you
[2:06] get baptized you must be sufficiently
[2:08] taught.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; And there's to me there's nothing better
[2:12] than this to teach you. And of course,
[2:15] you remember there was a question sent
[2:17] to me, I think we did on a Wednesday
[2:18] night where the question was said to me,
[2:21] you need to tell the young people uh
[2:24] about baptism. And I recognized the
[2:28] need. I just didn't see how God will
[2:30] allow to sort of come into this series
[2:34] because we had so many things going on
[2:36] at once. we had to deal with the request
[2:38] to be baptized and then of course the
[2:40] the Sunday school that we were starting
[2:42] um in a different way. So, and then it
[2:45] evolved into into this. And um so
[2:50] I I I would think that by the time we're
[2:53] done with this,
[2:55] um it would be securely entrenched in
[2:59] the hearts of our children, our young
[3:00] people, and those who want to be
[3:01] baptized. Because you can only make that
[3:04] decision if you know where you come
[3:06] from.
[3:08] &gt;&gt; Because when you're a young person, you
[3:10] really don't have too much to repent of.
[3:13] I was there.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; You know, you're you're you're a young
[3:17] person probably, you know, you've done
[3:20] some bad things that everyone else has
[3:22] done, but it doesn't
[3:25] um make you feel like I mean, you're
[3:28] being in the message church. You're born
[3:29] in families.
[3:31] You haven't become a drug dealer, you
[3:35] know, you haven't killed anyone. You
[3:38] haven't had your psychology, your
[3:40] mindset so changed that it needs to be
[3:43] changed to believe in Jesus Christ.
[3:46] You've been believing in Jesus Christ
[3:48] from the time you were in Sunday school,
[3:50] from the time you were a kid. What do
[3:52] you need to change to, right? Of course,
[3:55] if you were believing in a trinity
[3:57] doctrine,
[3:58] which you don't,
[4:01] you were believing in a wrong baptism
[4:03] being sprinkled or you're believing in
[4:05] some traditions or if you were believing
[4:07] in I don't know some other prophet
[4:12] uh if you were of some other kind of
[4:15] persuation and now you meet the message
[4:17] and now you're having a complete
[4:20] repentance,
[4:21] a complete change.
[4:24] But that's not where you are. You are
[4:25] born in this. You believe the prophet.
[4:29] You believe in Christ. You believe the
[4:30] right godhead doctrine. You believe the
[4:32] right baptism. You believe in
[4:34] predestination. So what do you need to
[4:36] repent of? See, this was my experience.
[4:39] Which is why I can tell you.
[4:42] I had nothing to repent of. I had no
[4:45] thinking to repent of. I already had the
[4:47] right thinking.
[4:49] So the only way that you can have a
[4:51] genuine experience with God is to
[4:54] actually know where you come from and
[4:57] that you young people born in this
[4:59] message.
[5:01] You are you know some people take 20
[5:04] years after repenting of where they came
[5:06] from to realize they are their real
[5:08] enemy.
[5:10] You are there right now. You are not
[5:12] taking 20 years to find out. You are
[5:14] right here, right now, finding out you
[5:16] are actually your real enemy.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; That's where I was. And that's why I'm
[5:22] telling you, unless you have the word of
[5:25] God open to you to see where you came
[5:28] from, where the attribute is, what it is
[5:31] that is fighting inside of you to
[5:32] recognize what the inward struggle is,
[5:35] then you will not have a real genuine
[5:37] experience when you get baptized. You'll
[5:40] just have a traditional event.
[5:44] But if you if you grasp this, if you
[5:48] believe this, if you have an experience
[5:50] with the word, you will come out feeling
[5:53] renewed and looking forward to be
[5:56] baptized with the Holy Ghost and
[5:58] purpose.
[6:00] &gt;&gt; That's why we're doing this.
[6:03] So, this brings me to uh and we're still
[6:06] talking about becoming sons because
[6:07] that's the reason why you should be
[6:09] waterbaptized because you cannot enter
[6:11] into the kingdom of God unless you are
[6:14] born again.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; And you don't have to go back into your
[6:17] mother's womb to be born again like I
[6:19] said to Nicodemus. But
[6:22] you've got to know where he came from.
[6:24] So, I was I was telling my son Josh the
[6:27] yesterday and he got so freaked out he
[6:30] ran out of the house and well silliness,
[6:33] 9-year-old silliness. I told him, "I'm
[6:35] an alien."
[6:38] And he sat up in his chair and he ran
[6:40] outside and, you know, made a big deal
[6:41] of it. I said, he said, and then he came
[6:43] back, "Are you really an alien?" I said,
[6:44] "Yeah, you just can't see my six eyes,
[6:47] &gt;&gt; you know." And I I said, "No, because
[6:49] the Lord Jesus said, I'm not of this
[6:51] world. Amen.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; And my kingdom is not of this world. He
[6:55] said to the Pharisees, you are from
[6:57] beneath. I am from above. I am not of
[7:00] this world and my kingdom is not of this
[7:01] world. Therefore, so I said, therefore,
[7:03] I am an alien
[7:06] because I'm of his kingdom. But that
[7:09] being said, so he said to me, what is an
[7:11] alien? So I was telling him how the
[7:12] Australian blue gun trees are alien
[7:15] trees here that rob our soil of water
[7:18] and kill our other indigenous trees.
[7:20] That's an alien. It's from Australia.
[7:22] Not that all Australians are aliens.
[7:26] Kind of rhymes, but
[7:29] that's what an alien is. It's something
[7:31] that doesn't belong in this in this
[7:33] land. And it it uh it takes away becomes
[7:36] parasitic and it takes it takes away it
[7:39] destroys our water table for other
[7:40] trees. A lot of you don't know that. A
[7:42] lot of you have been driving around here
[7:44] for for maybe 50 years and have never
[7:46] even known what a blue gum is, right?
[7:49] But they're there. So yet God has made
[7:54] this earth for sons of God, for us.
[7:58] And then it was taken over by somebody
[8:02] to the point where they now make it seem
[8:05] like we are the ones that are not from
[8:07] this place. And when Christ came and
[8:08] said, "This place is basically inhabited
[8:10] by those who are influenced from
[8:12] beneath, but my kingdom is that of
[8:15] above, which means I don't even have to
[8:17] act like how things are here." This is
[8:20] the reason why you can't hear my word.
[8:22] It's the reason why you can't believe
[8:24] me. This is the reason why you don't
[8:25] accept the way I live my life.
[8:29] Because I am of the kingdom above. Amen.
[8:32] So you young people and those of you
[8:34] wanting to be baptized, this is the this
[8:37] is the trial. You are being brought up
[8:40] every day to act like them, behave like
[8:44] them, to dress like them, to fit into
[8:46] their systems, and then still accept a
[8:49] word that says you are not them.
[8:53] That's enough to give a person
[8:56] uh a multi-personality disorder,
[9:01] MPD,
[9:03] right?
[9:05] Like schizophrenia.
[9:06] That's like sounds like spiritual
[9:09] multi-personality disorder.
[9:11] Like you're in this world, you have to
[9:14] su uh succumb to the things that they
[9:16] teach you. you you know not everything
[9:18] but your struggle every day is to deny
[9:21] what is being pumped into you from the
[9:23] time you were in pre- primary school.
[9:26] It's craziness for those of you parents
[9:29] who think this is a light thing. Believe
[9:31] me, the day is coming when you have to
[9:34] face up to what they're they're pushing
[9:35] out to to our children.
[9:39] So when you look at Ephesians 2:4-10 and
[9:42] how it says, "God who is rich in mercy,
[9:45] for his great love, wherewith would he
[9:47] love us?" Now this is where I want to
[9:48] bring you to. He says, "While you were
[9:52] yet sinners,
[9:54] &gt;&gt; what does that mean?
[9:56] While you were ignorant of him,
[10:01] &gt;&gt; while you believed in other things,
[10:04] while you never recognized him,
[10:09] he died for us.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; While you were dead in sins, he
[10:13] quickened us. He quickened us. Amen. So
[10:17] that's where we want to go to. And this
[10:19] is still about becoming sons of God. And
[10:21] this is part three. And our title is he
[10:24] sought us so we can find him. He sought
[10:29] in the Bible. Not not many of us look
[10:33] you know or use this kind of words
[10:35] today. No mother sitting here says to
[10:37] her son have you sought for your school
[10:39] socks.
[10:41] Nobody uses that. So sort is an old
[10:43] English word that actually means seek
[10:46] &gt;&gt; in the past tense. Right. So God sought
[10:52] us and this is going to bring a lot of
[10:54] understanding. This to me meant a lot to
[10:57] me growing up as a young person in the
[11:00] message and I've preached this probably
[11:01] twice in our church under a different
[11:03] series. Uh one was the adoption series
[11:05] and I think the other one was kind of
[11:07] mixed with predestination.
[11:09] But so
[11:10] I want to begin with letting you
[11:13] understand something. We are born into
[11:16] this world with our natures so corrupted
[11:21] by sin, so badly corrupted by sin from
[11:24] the very beginning that God's entire
[11:28] plan of redemption is to restore our
[11:31] natures back to the original. Are you
[11:33] with me?
[11:35] &gt;&gt; So I want to start there with doing
[11:38] works for achievement.
[11:40] This comes from corruption.
[11:43] Most people think God's word is
[11:46] instruction, God's instruction for you
[11:48] to follow. And if you don't follow, he
[11:50] will judge you and he will punish you.
[11:53] And people also feel that if you do
[11:56] everything his word says, then you will
[11:59] live a great life and you will have
[12:01] great reward.
[12:04] That almost sounds like Yeah.
[12:06] Isn't that right?
[12:09] And to a point, it makes people feel
[12:11] like they if they live by God's word, if
[12:15] you know those those months where uh you
[12:18] kept the message so well, you did
[12:20] nothing wrong and feels like you feel so
[12:22] pumped. Such a great month. God's
[12:25] blessings are upon us because and then
[12:27] you have this feeling rising up inside
[12:30] and the sense of accomplishment that you
[12:33] did something for God. That feeling or
[12:37] recognition for accomplishment is a
[12:40] result of sin.
[12:44] Accomplishment on its own should just
[12:46] produce happiness. You should just be
[12:48] happy that you accomplished something.
[12:50] Nobody else needs to know you
[12:51] accomplished it. You shouldn't even get
[12:53] reward from somebody, a recognition like
[12:56] a plaque that say you did such and such.
[12:58] Well done. That's from sin,
[13:03] right? You know, it's like um people
[13:07] would say I I I know I know how people
[13:09] think. I know how the the Bible the
[13:11] legalist Bible readers, oh, brother L,
[13:13] but God saw he created light and God saw
[13:16] that it was good.
[13:18] Yeah. But he didn't ask for an award for
[13:20] it
[13:22] or recognition from anybody.
[13:25] Saying it was good means he was happy
[13:27] with what he did. That's good. Being
[13:31] happy with your accomplishment is good.
[13:33] But expecting recognition for it is
[13:35] where sin comes in.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; So people believe that they, you know,
[13:39] they get this understanding from the
[13:41] English Bible, but they don't realize
[13:43] that the majority of the time when the
[13:45] word reward is used, it is just
[13:48] consequences.
[13:50] Like the the wicked the wicked shall
[13:52] receive his reward. That means uh so
[13:56] what does that mean? The wicked is going
[13:57] to get a reward. No, it means he's going
[14:00] to get the consequences of his actions.
[14:03] The wages of sin is death. Wages, the
[14:06] payment, the salary for sin is death.
[14:10] Who wants to get paid with death? So the
[14:13] Bible means the consequences,
[14:15] right? So they will have their reward.
[14:19] Does not mean even if you do something
[14:21] good, you will have your reward. It
[14:22] means if you think good things, if you
[14:24] act healthy uh and live a a righteous
[14:28] life, you will receive the consequences
[14:30] of a righteous life. Not that God's
[14:32] going to give you more blessings than
[14:34] another person. You actually might not
[14:36] get more blessings than another person,
[14:40] right?
[14:42] You know, um I I think I might have told
[14:45] you this sometime. [clears throat]
[14:47] If you have three sons like I do, let's
[14:50] say one is a really wise son, I'm not
[14:52] pointing any fingers,
[14:55] and one is absolutely reckless.
[14:59] Would you give an equal amount of money
[15:01] to them?
[15:05] No. You'd give the more money to the one
[15:08] who's responsible and less money to the
[15:10] one who's reckless.
[15:12] Right? So, do you think if you have
[15:15] weaknesses and issues and uh the the
[15:20] ability in your nature where you come
[15:22] from to be proud and to be arrogant, do
[15:25] you think God's going to make you a
[15:26] millionaire?
[15:28] But somebody who can actually handle
[15:30] that money, God might allow him to have
[15:33] that
[15:34] &gt;&gt; because he's responsible. Because he
[15:36] knows, God knows this son of mine can
[15:39] handle that. This one here will destroy
[15:41] himself with it. Rather not rather keep
[15:43] him poor. He's better off being poor.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; That's the consequences, right? So it
[15:54] doesn't matter if you're poor, you have
[15:56] your issues to deal with. If you're
[15:57] rich, you have your issues to deal with.
[16:00] True.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Um, and the majority of real believers I
[16:04] meet, the ones who are really rich and
[16:06] wealthy wish they had less stress. The
[16:10] ones who are uh poor wish they had more.
[16:15] It's insane.
[16:18] So, when when the first men Now, let me
[16:21] sh let me show you how this this came
[16:22] about, right? And as always, it's the
[16:25] woman's fault.
[16:29] You know, us men, you know, we we come
[16:31] we came back one day many, many years
[16:34] ago. We come back, we shot a rabbit, we
[16:36] brought it to our wife. Our wife was
[16:37] like, "You're the greatest thing in the
[16:39] world. That's amazing." And we think,
[16:42] "Oh, next time I'm getting three
[16:44] rabbits." This is how that seed of
[16:46] accomplishment started.
[16:49] See? And then you come back home and you
[16:51] shoot a deer and she's like, "Oh,
[16:52] universe."
[16:56] And makes us feel like king. We are
[16:58] heroes. We are accomplished. The next
[17:00] time you want to make sure and the next
[17:01] day she has a bad day and then we bring
[17:04] in something great and she just Yeah.
[17:05] Okay. Just leave it there. You know how
[17:08] that feels, brothers.
[17:10] That's it. You don't get your dopamine.
[17:12] You know, it's like what did I do? Like
[17:15] I did my best. You're not even
[17:16] acknowledging me. And suddenly we turn
[17:19] from men into little kicked puppies.
[17:22] Right? That's that that's how this
[17:25] accomplishment began a long time ago
[17:27] when people started recognizing and
[17:29] making you feel listen all you did was
[17:31] shoot a poor little rabbit for us to
[17:33] eat. You're not something great. That's
[17:36] what they should she should have told us
[17:37] in the beginning.
[17:41] Then we would have been on the level.
[17:42] Instead, we wanted to be better than the
[17:44] other husband in the other cave
[17:45] somewhere else or the other hut
[17:47] somewhere else. And you know, to make
[17:49] sure we we we feed them till we we all
[17:52] we have 10 rabbits for family with just
[17:54] two children.
[17:56] You know, nobody told him, listen, tone
[17:59] it down. We can only eat one rabbit.
[18:02] [clears throat]
[18:04] So, this this thing we have today, these
[18:06] we've got these this public pushing out
[18:08] these men who want TO ACCOMPLISH SO
[18:10] MUCH. THEY ACCOMPLISH SO MUCH IN ONE
[18:12] MONTH WHICH IS JUST A WASTE OF ENERGY,
[18:14] time and and resources. We're not even
[18:17] using this stuff.
[18:20] I guarantee you 60% to 70% of the stuff
[18:23] in your house is useless. You don't even
[18:25] use it.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; I'm telling the truth. All your
[18:30] decorations, all the stuff you have,
[18:33] even the amount of forks, knives, and
[18:35] spoons, you don't even you only need as
[18:37] much as for your family.
[18:40] That's how bad it is. But you got to
[18:41] have surplus.
[18:44] That's how much this accomplishment.
[18:46] Every time you see something bright and
[18:47] shiny and different and a new gadget,
[18:49] you got to have it. And then you come
[18:52] back home with that accomplishment. Look
[18:54] what I got. And your wife was saying,
[18:55] "Did you consider the budget?
[18:59] But it's so great. It's going TO HELP
[19:00] OUR LIFE OUT. IT'S going to make time.
[19:02] We'll save time with this." And oh my
[19:04] goodness,
[19:06] accomplishment. The idea of
[19:08] accomplishment for God results like when
[19:11] and this is the thing like when you try
[19:13] to to accomplish something for God and
[19:15] you're pushing at it and struggling at
[19:17] it and you're waiting for some
[19:19] recognition of achievement
[19:21] sometimes God's just not going to say
[19:23] anything. He's not even going to bless
[19:25] you for the great things you're doing.
[19:29] What do you do then? And it results in
[19:31] natures and behaviors. And I'll tell you
[19:32] what'll happen when you're doing
[19:35] something for God and you feel like
[19:36] you've done something so great for him
[19:39] that he needs to acknowledge you and
[19:41] give you blessings and you're not
[19:43] getting any response from him, then
[19:45] you're going to take that and go ask for
[19:47] men's recognition.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Right. And that make it makes
[19:54] predestination very hard to understand.
[19:57] So um today we we treat accomplishment
[20:01] with corrupt gestures.
[20:04] We have wasteful functions where we make
[20:07] a big deal of a person. We dress them in
[20:09] a robe and a hat and a crown and a
[20:11] scroll of paper and we sing songs to
[20:13] them and we hold our hands to our hearts
[20:16] and we throw caps in the air and you've
[20:18] accomplished something. And then you go
[20:21] off and become a sinner at university.
[20:23] Well done.
[20:25] Hm. And then after that you finish your
[20:27] degree and whatever you go to work and
[20:30] then uh you become a greatest sinner at
[20:32] work. But well done. Your career led you
[20:33] away from God,
[20:37] right? Or led you away from thinking
[20:41] with common sense about how TO BRING UP
[20:42] A FAMILY, how to how to have a wife and
[20:46] how to bring up children. But you got
[20:48] the plaque on the back wall with
[20:50] signatures from deans and so on who
[20:53] disbelieve God and who hate Christianity
[20:55] and all their names are signed there.
[20:57] How how great you are.
[21:02] Okay?
[21:04] And we do all this. We give, you know,
[21:07] and and then of course as families we
[21:08] pressurized. Trust me, we're
[21:10] pressurized. We have to be there. We
[21:12] have to take all the pictures. We have
[21:13] to give you a graduation gift from us. I
[21:15] mean, you already got the plaque. Why do
[21:17] you need a gift? But we have to give you
[21:19] a gift. You know, uh simple gesture made
[21:23] men go out and accomplish more. Let's
[21:26] accomplish more. Give them a gift. You
[21:28] take them for an expensive meal which is
[21:30] done in like 1 hour. Then we publish
[21:32] your names in the newspaper on the
[21:34] internet and and uh look who graduated
[21:36] today with a small little ugly baby
[21:38] picture there, you know, and they and
[21:42] then you don't seek accomplishment to
[21:44] help others, but you do it for
[21:47] recognition and for prestige.
[21:51] We have been bred with these natures for
[21:54] hundreds of years. Therefore, when
[21:56] Christians consider God, now why am I
[21:59] telling you all this stuff in a
[22:00] light-hearted manner? Because you bring
[22:02] the same thing when it comes to serving
[22:04] God,
[22:07] right? You want recognition for the good
[22:09] that you do and you actually believe
[22:12] that God behaves like carnal man. God's
[22:15] not going to put out the spread. God's
[22:17] not going to give you
[22:20] some thing with signatures. God's not
[22:22] going to give you some um some crown
[22:25] right now to make you recognized by all
[22:27] men. Look at what he said. While we were
[22:30] yet sinners, he quickened us.
[22:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even the atheists believe we are
[22:38] crazy because we believe God that and
[22:41] and this is right. They they will say to
[22:44] you, "You Christians are so crazy. You
[22:48] believe God's going to reward you for
[22:51] your muchdoing."
[22:54] But the message reveals to us that if
[22:57] our heart is not in our works, God
[23:00] doesn't even recognize your works.
[23:03] Because it's not it it doesn't become
[23:05] the four ordained works. They're just
[23:08] good works.
[23:11] Everybody does good works. like we told
[23:13] you last week, right? So then we come to
[23:16] this and this is the part where it it
[23:18] becomes more to what we're talking about
[23:20] to the young people and others who want
[23:23] to be baptized. Right? There are you are
[23:25] born with two natures.
[23:28] The one nature is the nature that comes
[23:30] through your parents and your natural
[23:32] bloodline. The other nature is the
[23:34] nature of God in the attribute form
[23:36] which is dormant. You don't know it yet.
[23:38] It hasn't started to live but it's
[23:40] there. Right? because you're a child of
[23:43] God. So the most important understanding
[23:46] of predestination and adoption is what
[23:49] God did and why he did it. Are you with
[23:53] me now? After man sinned, man became
[23:57] something that God could not be fully a
[23:59] part of.
[24:02] God could not be fully a part of. Not a
[24:04] part. A part of God. When you were a man
[24:09] filled with sin, God could not be a part
[24:11] of that. When you acted on beastly
[24:13] nature, God could not be a part of that.
[24:16] When you were acting by your tastes and
[24:18] your lustful desires and the desires of
[24:19] the eyes and the desires of the flesh,
[24:21] God could not be a part of that. That's
[24:24] what we became. Right? Man became the
[24:27] ruler of his own soul and began to go
[24:30] his own ways. And right? All we like
[24:32] sheep have gone astray. All of us. God
[24:35] could have left man alone and let Satan
[24:37] destroy man for his own purpose. But God
[24:40] originally created us for his purpose.
[24:44] That's what this is all about. Is that
[24:46] right? The story of God and man.
[24:49] And God knowing that he created man for
[24:52] his purpose had to redeem mankind back
[24:55] to the original purpose.
[24:58] Are you with us? So bringing full
[25:01] redemption back is God redeeming. Now
[25:04] you know what redeem is, right?
[25:08] To take back what is yours. Is that
[25:10] right? So when God's going to redeem
[25:13] you, he takes back what is his. He takes
[25:17] back his nature. He redeems his nature.
[25:22] And the other nature which you were born
[25:24] with from your parents is rejected.
[25:29] That means you can do good stuff with
[25:31] that other nature. It's got nothing to
[25:32] do with him.
[25:35] Listen, you must you must go visit your
[25:38] relatives who don't believe the word.
[25:39] You must visit them. You must be kind to
[25:41] them. You must take them gifts for their
[25:43] birthday parties. You must phone them
[25:45] once in a while and say hello to them
[25:47] and visit them and and have lunches and
[25:49] dinners. And you must do that. God
[25:51] doesn't care about that.
[25:53] He's not redeeming that.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and you will all testify to me
[25:58] that those things that you do for them,
[26:01] for other people are become more of a
[26:03] headache to you than anything. You wish
[26:05] you never did that in the first place.
[26:07] You you get this warm feeling inside, oh
[26:09] you know that aunt, we haven't visited.
[26:11] Let's go visit. Let's go find out how
[26:12] she's doing. Then you get there and
[26:14] realize why you haven't visited her in
[26:15] such a long time.
[26:18] And then your wife will tell you, what
[26:20] were you thinking? You see, we forgot
[26:23] what she's like. She hasn't changed.
[26:29] See, I'm just telling you what you
[26:31] already know. God's not interested. But
[26:34] you've got to do those things. You've
[26:35] got to go and do do stuff that is that
[26:38] is influenced by that other nature. It's
[26:40] part of being a human here in this life
[26:42] in this earth. Go do that. Don't tell me
[26:45] that that's God's work. Because God
[26:48] redeems his nature. He takes back what
[26:50] is his. The other one is dissolved.
[26:56] When the earthly house of this
[26:58] tabernacle be dissolved, those those
[27:00] natures just a place where the prophet
[27:03] said the Holy Ghost, you know, you have
[27:05] these positive and negatives to your
[27:07] character and the Holy Ghost shuts that
[27:09] other side away. God only takes what is
[27:11] his. He redeems what is his.
[27:16] So bringing full redemption would mean
[27:18] he has to do something to get rid of
[27:20] what was not his and take back what was
[27:23] his for his purpose. Are you with me?
[27:26] And that is referring to these original
[27:28] natures, these attributes that came from
[27:31] the fountain of life through the logos
[27:33] brought down to mankind.
[27:36] And God had to redeem and and direct the
[27:39] original nature of of man back to the
[27:42] original purpose he made man for. and
[27:45] let the fallen natures be destroyed in
[27:47] the process.
[27:51] You see, so all the troubles you have
[27:54] and the complaints you have, brother Al,
[27:55] I'm going through such a trial and I'm
[27:57] not feeling sorry for you because I I
[28:00] know those other natures are being
[28:03] destroyed, I know it's good for you.
[28:05] See, when you are able to correct your
[28:08] child
[28:09] who's being absolutely terribly behaved
[28:13] and you know that everything you have to
[28:14] do is going to hurt him.
[28:17] The things you have to say to him is
[28:19] going to hurt him. It's going to it's
[28:21] going to rub him up the wrong way. It's
[28:23] going to tell him you're being a
[28:25] horrible person right now
[28:28] and you don't deserve anything good from
[28:30] me right now. And you have he has to
[28:31] hear that. He has to hear that. If you
[28:35] just say, "Oh, you poor thing. You just
[28:36] made a mistake. Here, have a candy.
[28:40] You poor thing." Positive reinforcement.
[28:43] He's not getting it. That there's some
[28:46] parts of him that's horrid
[28:48] and that nobody likes it and he needs to
[28:52] deal with it and learn how to overpower
[28:54] that. He needs to know that and he needs
[28:57] to probably get recognition for
[29:00] overpowering that
[29:02] on his own.
[29:05] See, so God had planted that seed in
[29:10] Adam and Eve to bring forth the sons of
[29:13] God. Is that right? That's what we're
[29:14] talking about. Becoming sons and that
[29:17] seed remains in man.
[29:20] That ability of Adam and Eve to bring
[29:23] forth sons of God remains in you. Do you
[29:26] know what it is that's driving you every
[29:29] day? You know, like when I was talking
[29:31] to the young people there in Canada and
[29:33] telling them about what sexuality is and
[29:37] understand the reality once you hit
[29:39] puberty and you just pass puberty, your
[29:41] body wants to have children. That's the
[29:43] whole reason why you're going through
[29:44] all this turmoil. your body whether
[29:47] you're male or female the the biology if
[29:49] you took out your brain
[29:52] if that was possible your mind let's say
[29:54] you took out your mind
[29:56] uh or let's say a woman in a coma
[30:00] uh you know this has happened right the
[30:02] woman can be in a total coma she doesn't
[30:04] know anything and she's pregnant the
[30:07] body will bring forth the child
[30:10] while she has no knowledge absolutely
[30:13] nothing the body will bring forth the
[30:14] child that what I'm saying is without
[30:16] your emotions and everything. Your body
[30:19] wants to bring forth children.
[30:23] That's the reason for all the sexual
[30:26] problems in the world because what they
[30:27] want to do is they want to wait as long
[30:30] as possible not to have kids, finish
[30:33] their degree, buy their house, buy their
[30:34] car, and think they can manage the
[30:36] beast.
[30:39] You can't
[30:40] &gt;&gt; because that beast is screaming out to
[30:42] produce because from the beginning the
[30:44] law said
[30:46] be fruitful multiply and bring forth
[30:50] bring forth sons. Now bring that to the
[30:53] spiritual. You as children of God the
[30:56] reason why you are having trouble
[30:59] spiritually is because you are not
[31:02] bringing forth sons.
[31:04] You are not testifying of the word. You
[31:06] are you are given that commission and
[31:09] that ability to speak to the world to
[31:12] tell them the word and you are not doing
[31:14] it. You're getting comfortable with your
[31:16] relatives. You in the beginning you told
[31:18] them there's the message and then they
[31:20] they they started rejecting you. But now
[31:22] you stopped. You feel like you know
[31:23] what? We just need good relations. We
[31:26] need to be more like them. We need to be
[31:29] okay with all the stuff they do and you
[31:31] forgot you're supposed to bring forth
[31:32] sons. It doesn't matter whether you're
[31:35] comfortable with them and they got used
[31:37] to you being weird that you don't still
[31:39] need to live the word before them. You
[31:43] are still responsible to bring forth
[31:45] sons.
[31:47] That's why you're in spiritual
[31:48] depression because you're not doing
[31:50] that.
[31:52] That seed is still planted in there. It
[31:54] must bring forth through the serpent and
[31:57] the reasoning of the word of God. Satan
[32:00] also planted his seed in mankind. So
[32:03] mankind is also going to bring forth two
[32:05] kinds of men. One kind who will choose
[32:08] to believe the word of God and another
[32:10] kind who will choose not to believe the
[32:12] word of God. So that's what's happening.
[32:14] Young people even if you grew up in the
[32:17] message that nature is still there
[32:19] because it came in by sexual birth. The
[32:22] new birth produc brings the seed that
[32:25] will bring forth spiritual sons. The
[32:28] sexual birth you are born with brings
[32:30] the other nature that will bring forth
[32:32] other humans with the false natures.
[32:36] So you are bringing forth whether you
[32:38] like it or not.
[32:41] Are you with me? The challenge was that
[32:44] each man and woman is born with free
[32:47] moral agency. That means you have the
[32:50] choice to do as you please. And you are
[32:52] born into this world with no knowledge,
[32:56] conscious knowledge of God. You don't
[32:59] know God. You don't know Jesus. You
[33:00] don't know the prophet. You don't know
[33:02] the five-fold ministry. You don't know
[33:03] the Bible. You only become conscious of
[33:05] the Bible when you get to uh Sunday
[33:08] school. Right?
[33:11] And even then, you got so many
[33:12] questions.
[33:15] Amen. So the challenge is free moral
[33:18] agency and to do as you please. So God
[33:22] had to constantly do things. Now this is
[33:25] where we come into our subject. God had
[33:28] to do things to find you.
[33:32] I use the word find in
[33:35] inverted commas because there's a
[33:38] mystery to that, right? He had to find
[33:41] these children. That means those with
[33:43] his character among the sea of humans,
[33:48] he's got to find him. Right? So what
[33:50] does finding mean? What does it mean to
[33:54] be found? How often do we sing, I once
[33:57] was lost, but now I'm found. Once was
[34:00] blind, but now I see. But how were you
[34:02] found?
[34:04] Do you really know what it means? Do you
[34:07] really know so much what it means TO BE
[34:09] FOUND AND BASK IN THE REVELATION of
[34:11] being found?
[34:14] It might sound like an easy task because
[34:16] well, he is God. You know, he knows all
[34:17] the humans. He knows their heart. He
[34:19] knows their soul. He knows there's my
[34:21] son, there's my daughter, there's that
[34:23] one. What's there to find? He just knows
[34:25] everybody. What does it mean? You've
[34:27] been found,
[34:29] right? So, it's easy. He is God. But it
[34:33] wasn't quite so simple. The complication
[34:37] was not about finding someone's
[34:39] location.
[34:41] It's not about where you are
[34:43] geographically. Like God found me in
[34:46] Newcastle, South Africa. There I was
[34:49] wandering around and he went around the
[34:51] world looking for me and found me there.
[34:54] No man, he's God. Geography doesn't even
[34:58] matter, right? So, uh it's not about
[35:02] which part of the world you are. Of
[35:03] course, he knows that already.
[35:06] God finding you means something else. He
[35:10] sought us, right? That's the first part.
[35:14] He sought us so we can find him. That's
[35:18] my title, right? So, here's the thing.
[35:22] It's something you're all together
[35:23] familiar with. Just ask yourself these
[35:26] questions.
[35:28] Did you find God first
[35:31] or did he find you?
[35:35] Because you grow up thinking you found
[35:37] God.
[35:40] But the Bible SAYS WHILE WE WERE YET
[35:42] SINNERS,
[35:44] that means while you were unconscious of
[35:46] him, he was already doing something.
[35:50] Right? So if you say you found him, what
[35:53] do you mean you found him? How did you
[35:55] find him? Where is he? Is he in your
[35:59] house, your picture? Did you find a
[36:00] religion? Did you find a philosophy?
[36:03] What do you mean you found him?
[36:07] So, you'll admit that no matter how
[36:09] unique your situation was, and this why
[36:12] I'm talking to those who want to be
[36:13] baptized, do you believe you found God?
[36:17] Why do you want to be baptized? Do you
[36:19] believe he's found you?
[36:22] Do you think you need to be baptized
[36:24] because it's tradition or you want to be
[36:26] safe or you want to make the rapture or
[36:28] you if if you should die, you'll be
[36:30] resurrected.
[36:32] Why do you want to be baptized?
[36:35] This is the whole reason why we went
[36:36] through everything to do with baptism.
[36:39] And it all comes down to accepting what
[36:41] God's purpose for you is for for this
[36:43] day.
[36:45] Amen. So if you say you found him, what
[36:48] do you mean? So whatever your situation
[36:52] is. So whatever unique situation you
[36:54] know I I hear stories you know some
[36:57] brother was sitting on a plane he was
[36:58] sitting next to another person he was
[37:00] reading a book the person looks at him
[37:01] and said what book you are reading and
[37:03] he starts talking about it and the next
[37:04] thing you know he's get off the plane
[37:06] and they're baptizing this guy in the
[37:07] nearest river. What a story. That's
[37:11] actually a real story. And uh so you you
[37:15] u that's your story and then that's how
[37:17] I found God.
[37:20] No, that's how he found you.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; You thought you found him.
[37:28] Now, now that you know him, you can see
[37:31] that he knew the perfect moment of your
[37:33] life, the perfect time that you should
[37:35] be sitting next to somebody who was
[37:37] reading a book.
[37:41] Now, when you when you understand who
[37:42] God is, you'll know he inspired somebody
[37:45] at the right time to take that flight.
[37:48] knowing you'd be sitting in that seat
[37:50] and do so many things to make sure that
[37:53] fellow is sitting in the seat next to
[37:54] you
[37:56] that while you were yet sinners,
[38:00] &gt;&gt; he quickened you.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; He even had to quicken that seat because
[38:04] at any time you could have chosen I
[38:06] don't want to take this flight, I want
[38:07] to take the next one. Uh and why were
[38:10] you on that flight in the first place?
[38:12] You thought you knew why you were on
[38:13] that flight. You have no idea how the
[38:15] seed was quickened and made sure you
[38:17] WERE ON THAT FLIGHT BECAUSE IT QUICKENED
[38:18] SOMEONE ELSE TO BE THERE at the same
[38:20] time.
[38:21] &gt;&gt; IT'S HIS WORK. HE FOUND YOU.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; See, and you can see that he knew the
[38:29] perfect moment in your life because had
[38:32] he wait had he tried or done it one year
[38:35] before, you might have been still too
[38:36] hard-headed to listen.
[38:39] He knew exactly when something had to
[38:42] break. Something had to happen in your
[38:45] life for you to be at the perfect moment
[38:47] to hear that word.
[38:50] He sought every one of us. So, are you
[38:52] all together with me, young people? How
[38:55] does God seek you?
[38:58] God has only one way. It's so unfair
[39:03] because the devil has so many ways.
[39:06] H God has only one only one way and it's
[39:09] his word. Nothing else.
[39:13] Amen. Some people think, you know, uh it
[39:16] was a life and death situation. Had a
[39:18] car accident. I almost died when I came
[39:20] out. You know, I just said to God, you
[39:22] know, uh uh if you save my life, come
[39:25] on. Stop being a businessman with God.
[39:28] You save MY LIFE, THEN I'LL SERVE YOU.
[39:30] And God says, "Oh, yeah. He means it
[39:33] this time. Let's save him."
[39:37] No. God doesn't use those things.
[39:40] If that did happen to you, God already
[39:42] brought the word to you and you were too
[39:44] hard-headed to accept it then and you
[39:46] would needed maybe this car crash to
[39:47] make you wake up to it. But it already
[39:49] made contact with you.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; You didn't just have some epiphany
[39:53] because you were such a great person you
[39:56] suddenly realized I need to change.
[40:01] You cannot even think that you should
[40:04] change unless he finds you first.
[40:08] Let's read. So let's get to this
[40:10] subject. He sought you. You did not seek
[40:13] him. The unconditional covenant that God
[40:16] made with his people.
[40:19] Man said, "Oh brother, I sought God." No
[40:23] man ever sought God. There's our
[40:26] starting point. Doesn't matter how good
[40:28] you think you are, you did not seek God.
[40:33] He sought you. Not in a man to seek God.
[40:37] It's not even in you to search for him.
[40:40] No man at any time or any age ever
[40:43] sought God. It's just vice versa. It's
[40:47] God seeking the man, not man seeking
[40:50] God. Jesus said, "No man come to me
[40:53] except my father draws him." Is that
[40:57] right? Amen.
[41:00] The very beginning man when he fell from
[41:02] grace, his nature was changed. That's
[41:05] what I I was talking about the last 15
[41:07] minutes. Man, when he fell from grace,
[41:09] his nature was changed. He run from God
[41:11] and hid from God. And that's still his
[41:14] nature. A man can never seek God while
[41:18] he's a sinner.
[41:21] God has to seek man.
[41:24] So that's where our subject comes from.
[41:25] And this is what that fornowledge does
[41:28] and brings you to is that you don't
[41:30] know. is such a wonderful thought. It
[41:32] adds so much clarity to the
[41:34] understanding of predestination and
[41:36] fornowledge. It it throws out all the
[41:39] ideas of my efforts, my work, my
[41:42] achievements. Is this right?
[41:44] &gt;&gt; What I did to find him. Oh brother, I
[41:48] prayed. I went to this temple. I went to
[41:50] that mosque. I went to this. And that's
[41:52] you searching for God. You didn't
[41:54] realize he already found you.
[41:57] See, you wouldn't be searching for him
[42:01] unless he already found you.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; And how did he find you? By his word.
[42:08] Even if at that moment, one day you'll
[42:11] come to know when that word hit you.
[42:14] But you can go a whole a whole lifetime
[42:18] almost and not realize when he found
[42:20] you.
[42:21] It's so beautiful. I realized that I was
[42:25] wrong to ever think that I was the one
[42:27] who was searching for him. Man has never
[42:30] sought God by himself. From the
[42:33] beginning when Adam sinned, his instinct
[42:35] was to run and hide. Is that right?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; He comes in Adam, Adam, where art thou?
[42:40] Why didn't he run to God? He was running
[42:43] away from the very beginning of sin. And
[42:45] it was God coming to him. Adam, Adam,
[42:47] where art thou? Symbolically, God
[42:50] finding his son.
[42:53] That was obviously symbolic
[42:55] conversation. Did God really not know
[42:57] that Adam was hiding behind the bushes?
[43:00] Of course, he knew this was the spirit
[43:02] of God. So, God finding Adam, what is
[43:06] it? WHAT? WHAT IS THAT? BREAK IT DOWN.
[43:08] Take it away from words and Bible
[43:10] stories and all of that. What does it
[43:12] mean? Adam, Adam, where art thou?
[43:14] It's God's word brooding upon his son,
[43:17] calling him to repentance.
[43:21] Come to me. Tell me what you've done.
[43:25] Tell me. I can take it. Admit to your
[43:28] fault. Admit. Come to me. That's
[43:32] repentance, young people.
[43:35] God was always seeking man while man was
[43:37] always running away from God. Man grows
[43:39] up without the knowledge of the one true
[43:41] God. And all man wants to do is his own
[43:43] will. Is that right? And then after sin
[43:47] came in, humans did not even have the
[43:50] desire for God. The I I've often told
[43:53] you this and I'm always so blatantly
[43:57] brutally honest with you about how it is
[44:00] that we feel as humans. I love to do
[44:03] that because I, you know, I don't like
[44:06] this this this uh fantasy kind of uh
[44:10] perception that people have. Let's be
[44:13] brutally honest about life, about our
[44:15] feelings, our intentions, our thoughts,
[44:18] right? So, after sin
[44:22] uh came into mankind, we don't even
[44:24] desire God on some days. Be honest, you
[44:28] don't even want to read your Bible.
[44:31] You don't even want to listen to the
[44:33] message. I know some of you are
[44:34] Wednesday, you don't even want to be on
[44:36] a Zoom meeting cuz you got something
[44:39] better to do. I know that it's a human
[44:41] condition. I'm telling you, it's a human
[44:42] condition not to want to chase after
[44:45] God.
[44:48] And many of you can succumb to that.
[44:52] But you all know how that you are
[44:54] totally incentivized to do what you want
[44:57] to do.
[44:59] You will take time off church, God,
[45:03] whatever it is to do something for your
[45:05] career because you want it. To do
[45:07] something for your boss because you want
[45:09] it to do something for whatever else is
[45:12] in the world because YOU WANT THAT. YOU
[45:14] WILL do what you want to do above what
[45:17] God wants you to do. It's still there.
[45:22] You're still struggling with it.
[45:26] The relationships with God was based on
[45:28] things that they could that they felt
[45:31] could not be explained, right? Like why
[45:35] someone gets sick? That's that's all we
[45:37] want from God, right? We want to know
[45:40] Lord, why did I get sick? Why someone
[45:43] dies? Why is there drought or famine?
[45:47] Why is there natural disaster? That
[45:49] became the relationship of man to God
[45:52] because now it's God's fault. WHEN
[45:53] SOMETHING CANNOT BE EXPLAINED, then God
[45:55] is in it. Like I DON'T UNDERSTAND, YOU
[45:58] KNOW, I SET MY TIME TABLE OUT PERFECTLY.
[46:00] I MESSED UP MY LIFE. WHY DID THIS
[46:02] HAPPEN? Now we ask God,
[46:06] right? Relationships with God became
[46:09] about needing better health, needing
[46:12] protection, warding of evil.
[46:15] And the relationship was a that kind of
[46:17] relationship with God is a very volatile
[46:19] one.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Right? In fact, history show us that man
[46:24] blamed God initially,
[46:26] excuse me, when bad things happened to
[46:29] them.
[46:31] And therefore, they created their own
[46:33] gods so it could make them feel better
[46:36] because they rejected the one true God
[46:38] and then made up other gods because the
[46:40] other one was not satisfying them.
[46:44] So with all that, God had to find a way
[46:49] to find those who would believe. By that
[46:53] I mean maybe you don't appreciate the
[46:58] how how massive this is.
[47:01] you one person if if you take your
[47:04] surname right whatever your surname is
[47:06] and all the people born into your family
[47:09] and you're just the one person who's
[47:11] going to believe the word God has God
[47:14] knows when you were under your parents'
[47:16] influence your uncle's influence your
[47:19] family's influence he knows when you
[47:22] were under university influence when you
[47:24] were under work influence is watching
[47:26] this tracking
[47:28] and he knows exactly when the right time
[47:30] to bring you the
[47:31] when you're going to listen
[47:34] and accept but he already can see all
[47:36] the baggage you're coming with too
[47:39] right so to find the way to find you
[47:46] right to those who believe by that I
[47:48] mean he had to provide a unique plan for
[47:52] each one of you
[47:55] to let the word reach you whom he had
[47:58] forneew
[48:00] at at the right time so that we would
[48:02] recognize him.
[48:04] Are we together now? Now hold that
[48:07] thought. That's God finding you
[48:10] now. You've already been found. God is
[48:13] not finding you every day now. You've
[48:15] already been found. Amen. Glory to God.
[48:19] We are creatures that would never have
[48:21] believed the word had he just come and
[48:23] told us the truth. People were like,
[48:25] "Lord, why didn't you just come to me
[48:27] when I was 16 and just told me, showed
[48:30] me THE MESSAGE? WHY DID I HAVE TO GO
[48:32] THROUGH ALL THOSE HARDSHIPS IN MY
[48:34] FAMILY?" Because he knows at 16, you
[48:36] would never have accepted it.
[48:40] You actually might have said something
[48:41] and rejected it to your own detriment.
[48:45] You probably would have SAID SOME REALLY
[48:47] STUPID things against the word and
[48:49] become accountable for saying those
[48:51] things.
[48:53] He knew when to bring it
[48:57] &gt;&gt; because he knew there was a gene seed
[48:59] inside, right? And he had to he had to
[49:02] brother Alistister, this is sounding
[49:04] like, you know, too much of philosophy.
[49:07] If this beast does something against the
[49:11] word, it's going to be judged.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; He wants the best possible outcome for
[49:17] that attribute. And he also needs to
[49:20] keep peace with this beast to make sure
[49:23] the best possible outcome is achieved.
[49:26] Right? He doesn't want to antagonize
[49:28] your body. He wants to give you the best
[49:31] chance to become the best you can be.
[49:36] Of course, he's also fighting against
[49:38] your free will. Just think about it,
[49:40] saints, right? He just come and if he
[49:43] just come and told us the truth because
[49:45] we are gods to ourselves ruling our own
[49:48] heart and souls and minds and refusing
[49:50] the word of God and everyone else. Just
[49:53] think about it. If Jesus appeared to the
[49:55] world right now, if if like the
[49:58] Pentecostals say, he splits the skies,
[50:00] trumpets blow, and Jesus is there
[50:02] hovering over a a cloud with light
[50:05] shining behind him, standing there with
[50:08] billowing cotton cloth
[50:12] from heaven,
[50:14] you know, and his halo around his couple
[50:17] of angels singing behind him,
[50:20] right? and he's what do you think's
[50:23] going to happen?
[50:25] I'll tell you what'll happen. CNN and
[50:28] BBC and news outlets would be focused in
[50:30] a 24/7 HELICOPTERS BE FLYING AROUND.
[50:33] What is this? What is this mic? Looks
[50:35] like a hologram.
[50:39] Looks like some scientific thing. I
[50:41] wonder if it's something Elon Musk has
[50:43] made.
[50:44] You mean to tell me if you see a
[50:46] physical literal Jesus there, you're
[50:48] immediately going to saying, "Lord
[50:50] Jesus." No, you won't. You've been so
[50:53] bred to distrust everything. If that
[50:56] even happened, you're going to think
[50:58] some government person did something.
[51:01] And then you're going to depend on CNN,
[51:03] BBC, and all these, you know, Al Jazzer
[51:06] is going to say that's a devil,
[51:11] right? because of course they don't
[51:12] believe in Christians.
[51:15] Uh you'll have all parts of the world,
[51:18] Islam and every other religion speaking
[51:21] out against it, discrediting. You might
[51:23] even find some fool who try to shoot a
[51:26] missile at it.
[51:28] Do not think in your mind you can have
[51:30] this romantic idea that Christ is going
[51:33] to appear and everyone's going to say,
[51:35] "Ah, it's Jesus. The Christians were
[51:38] right.
[51:43] What a load of hogwash.
[51:46] This is the reason why that whole theory
[51:48] falls flat because you're never going to
[51:51] believe it,
[51:53] right? The world would distrust him
[51:56] instantly. Even even if it is Jesus,
[51:59] they rejected him the first time. What
[52:01] makes you think they're going to accept
[52:02] him a second time? Even then, they're
[52:04] going to distrust him and believe it's
[52:06] some pop or some government operative
[52:08] posing as a religious figure in the sky
[52:11] somewhere. Probably has a backpack on
[52:12] him, you know, flying backpack. The
[52:15] world has been primed to disbelieve,
[52:17] saints, and the appearance of a holy
[52:19] person of God is not going to show
[52:21] anything to them.
[52:23] If man cannot see God, listen young
[52:27] people, if you cannot see God through
[52:30] his word, you will not see him anywhere
[52:33] else.
[52:34] Because that's the only way he finds
[52:36] you, through his word. It's scriptural.
[52:40] In the beginning was the word, the
[52:42] logos, and the word was with God, and
[52:44] the word was God.
[52:49] And the word was made FLESH AND DWELT
[52:50] AMONG US. AND CHRIST SAID, "MY words
[52:52] that I speak unto you are spirit and
[52:54] life." He said to the Pharisees, "Why do
[52:56] you not hear my words?
[53:00] Why can you not believe even because you
[53:01] cannot hear my words?
[53:04] But blessed are your eyes. Blessed are
[53:06] your ears, for they can hear." So if a
[53:08] man cannot see, this is why I say to
[53:10] you, we can pray for you. We can lay
[53:13] hands on you. We can bring you to the
[53:14] altar. We can we can do all those all
[53:17] those things have been done for 2,000
[53:18] years of church tradition. If the word
[53:20] cannot help you today, nothing can.
[53:24] That's the truth. Let's go to Psalm 14
[53:28] verse 1 to3. To the chief musician, a
[53:31] psalm of David. The fool has said in his
[53:33] heart, "There is no God.
[53:37] They are corrupt. They have abominable
[53:39] works. There is none that doeth good."
[53:41] The Lord looked down from heaven upon
[53:43] the children of men to see if there were
[53:45] any that did understand and seek God.
[53:49] They are all gone aside. They are allto
[53:52] together become filthy. There is none
[53:54] that doeth good. No, not one. This is a
[53:58] psalmist speaking in prophetic psalms to
[54:01] say the Lord looked down from heaven to
[54:03] see if there's anyone who searches for
[54:05] him. They all waste their time.
[54:09] So for you to begin seeking him. So
[54:11] here's my point. For you to begin
[54:13] seeking him, you have to first recognize
[54:16] him and desire him. As long as you are a
[54:20] sinner, that all you're desiring,
[54:23] everything you're desiring is selfish.
[54:25] Even if you desire a religion, it's
[54:27] selfish.
[54:30] Why? What do you want from that
[54:32] religion? Huh? You want someone to do
[54:35] prayers for you, someone to marry you,
[54:37] someone to baptize your children,
[54:39] someone to uh make you feel good in case
[54:42] you die, someone to do your funeral. I
[54:44] still have that question. Brother Al,
[54:45] are you going to be my pastor? Will you
[54:47] bury me?
[54:51] I don't know. Will you bury me?
[54:55] H what does it matter whether you buried
[54:57] or not? Whether you eaten by the fishes
[54:59] or died in a fire, who cares? Hm. What
[55:03] about your soul right now?
[55:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not your pastor to bury you. Come
[55:07] on, man. Got more important things to do
[55:09] than bury you.
[55:13] You just want salvation from your
[55:15] transgressions so that you can have a
[55:16] normal life. I just want a normal life.
[55:18] I just want a HEALTHY BODY. I JUST want
[55:20] a wealthy life. I can tell you how to do
[55:23] that. If you want a normal life, don't
[55:26] be stupid. If you want a healthy life,
[55:29] eat healthy. If you want a wealthy life,
[55:31] be responsible, get a job, and do some
[55:33] work.
[55:36] Okay, that's how you do it. God doesn't
[55:38] do that.
[55:41] That's selfishness to have to follow God
[55:44] to make all those things work for you.
[55:46] You see how other people who are not in
[55:49] the message, not Christians, not there
[55:51] in the world, how other people they are
[55:54] doing things and they are achieving
[55:56] things in their lives by the exact same
[55:59] thing.
[56:00] They don't do stupid things. They live
[56:03] healthy. They're at the gym. They they
[56:05] eat the right amounts on their place.
[56:06] They don't take second and third
[56:08] helpings,
[56:13] right? They will live longer than you.
[56:16] And they don't have the Holy Ghost. See?
[56:20] And they're wealthy because they save
[56:22] their money and uh they know their
[56:25] budget. You know, they know they earn so
[56:27] much and they're not going to buy some
[56:29] expensive shoes that breaks the bank.
[56:32] Just buy shoes you can walk in. It's
[56:33] good enough, right?
[56:36] But you see other people, you see them
[56:39] serving God and they're so happy and
[56:41] here am I. I'm down in the dumps. Even
[56:43] if you're a rich somebody, you down in
[56:45] the dumps. What is wrong with you? YOU
[56:47] YOU REALLY don't care for God. All you
[56:50] want is what good might come out of
[56:53] serving God.
[56:55] You want stability and you want
[56:57] happiness. So then you join a church.
[56:59] You convince yourself that you have
[57:00] found God. And that's the illusion
[57:03] because you've actually found Satan.
[57:09] And Satan can keep you under that for
[57:11] years
[57:15] unless God because what is Satan?
[57:17] Shayan. Adversary of God. That's the
[57:20] meaning of the the name. You found the
[57:23] adversary of God. BECAUSE WHY IS IT AN
[57:25] ADVERSARY OF GOD? Because it's against
[57:27] God's purpose.
[57:30] See, unless God finds you first, you
[57:33] cannot even start looking for him. You
[57:36] might be looking for something, but it's
[57:37] not even close to because how can you
[57:39] find or or search for something you
[57:41] don't even know,
[57:44] man? You must be something.
[57:47] I'm for I'm I'm searching for it. WHAT
[57:49] IS IT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT I'M SEARCHING
[57:50] for it. It's craziness, right? And then
[57:53] some, you know, uh, after he finds you,
[57:56] he has to do some mysterious work on you
[57:59] before you can start looking for him.
[58:01] And that's the whole point. He searches
[58:03] for you. He finds you so that you can
[58:06] then search for him.
[58:09] Amen. So what does God have to do? God
[58:11] has to change your nature. Uh, Hebrews
[58:14] chapter 7 part one, part 142. If you
[58:17] love him, not a duty. I can't do this
[58:20] and I can't do that. You love him too
[58:23] much to do it because he has chosen you.
[58:25] You never chose him. He chose you. You
[58:28] said, "I sought the Lord and sought the
[58:30] Lord." No man seeks God. It's God
[58:34] seeking man. You might be seeking a
[58:37] favor of him, but God has to change your
[58:40] nature before you can seek after him
[58:45] because you're a sinner. You're a pig.
[58:49] That's right.
[58:51] See, you don't laugh when brother
[58:53] Brandon calls you a pig,
[58:56] right? See, God is to change your
[58:59] nature. So, this is where I'm bringing
[59:00] our thought in. You cannot find him. You
[59:04] cannot even search for him unless he
[59:07] changes your nature in. So, how's he
[59:10] going to change your nature? Remember,
[59:11] you're born with those two. That means
[59:13] the other one comes alive.
[59:16] And now you've got these two natures
[59:17] battling. So now you're going to be
[59:19] driven by the other nature that now
[59:22] wants to search for God. The other one
[59:25] was were searching for idols and
[59:27] something it could be could be happy in
[59:29] its achievement. That other nature was
[59:31] searching for a comfortable religion, a
[59:33] tradition, a way of life, but this one
[59:35] is going to find God.
[59:38] Right? So we only search, this is the
[59:42] truth, saints, we only search for man's
[59:44] concept of God. Even sometimes you're
[59:46] sitting in a message church, you're not
[59:48] listening to the open book and um a lot
[59:51] of people today, they're only searching
[59:53] for William Brandon.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; That's it. They're searching for a
[59:57] prophet. You've already found the
[59:59] prophet and and and and it's it's almost
[1:00:02] a delusion that you think you're serving
[1:00:04] and following the prophet. You're
[1:00:06] following your idea of the prophet. If
[1:00:09] you actually had that prophet in front
[1:00:10] of you and you could only see what
[1:00:12] you're doing with his words,
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; man,
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; he will chastise you,
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; but you've deluded yourself into
[1:00:19] thinking we're following the prophet.
[1:00:22] You're not even meant to follow the
[1:00:24] prophet. The prophet comes to a point
[1:00:26] where he says, "I must decrease, he must
[1:00:28] increase."
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; So, you search for a concept of him.
[1:00:34] Even if you're under some message
[1:00:36] minister and he's preaching a concept of
[1:00:38] God because we need something and then
[1:00:42] we don't have need for him for God
[1:00:44] anymore. We need this concept.
[1:00:48] Isn't that kind of what happens in the
[1:00:50] message today? We have this phenomenal
[1:00:53] Pentecostal experience as a young
[1:00:55] person. I'M SO DESPERATE FOR GOD. I GO
[1:00:57] TO THE CAMPS. I go to the the youth
[1:00:59] meetings and I I lay down on on the
[1:01:01] floor. I kneel down and I I, you know,
[1:01:04] SCREW UP MY EYES TILL I'M SERIOUS and
[1:01:06] I'm raising my hands. I'M SHOUTING. I'M
[1:01:09] GETTING the Holy Spirit,
[1:01:13] DESPERATE FOR GOD. IN the meantime, you
[1:01:16] just want to find a nice church girl who
[1:01:18] won't give us trouble, get a nice job,
[1:01:21] settle down, and then live the rest of
[1:01:23] our life enjoying the comforts of the
[1:01:25] social life that this church provides.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; That's what you really want. and tell me
[1:01:31] you're desperate for God. You're
[1:01:33] desperate for a wife or a girlfriend or
[1:01:35] a boyfriend and hoping you can get one
[1:01:37] here in a message church.
[1:01:40] You're not desperate for God
[1:01:43] yet.
[1:01:45] You can't be unless he finds you.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; So, what do you do then? You you go
[1:01:51] through the motions. You you went
[1:01:53] through the camps. You found the girl.
[1:01:55] You married the girl. You had the
[1:01:56] children. You thought were going to be a
[1:01:58] blessing.
[1:02:00] You got the house, you got the dog, you
[1:02:02] got all that stuff, and then you come to
[1:02:04] church, and then you sit down and do
[1:02:06] nothing,
[1:02:10] right? You go all the way back to that
[1:02:12] pig nature. You see, HE HAS TO TAKE YOU
[1:02:14] THROUGH A process to change that pig
[1:02:17] nature inside, that selfishness, that
[1:02:20] arrogance. You know, you're you stop
[1:02:23] studying the word. You you found him.
[1:02:26] Then you stop studying the word. You
[1:02:27] stop witnessing. You stop living for the
[1:02:29] for others. You're living for yourself,
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; for your own responsibilities, your own
[1:02:35] lifestyle. You're only And you tell me
[1:02:37] you're searching for God.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; He surely found you. But then you're
[1:02:42] following a concept. You're happy with
[1:02:44] the concept.
[1:02:48] You know, when the concept changes, then
[1:02:51] suddenly it upsets your apple cart.
[1:02:55] And then no, this is wrong. You know,
[1:02:58] you're not upset with God. You're upset
[1:02:59] with the concept having changed. It's
[1:03:02] making me uncomfortable.
[1:03:04] You've gotten so used to this comfort.
[1:03:08] So, you see, he has to make you go
[1:03:11] through a process to change you, take
[1:03:12] out the selfishness, the arrogance to
[1:03:14] think that, and some of us, it's going
[1:03:16] to take us so long. You're going to go
[1:03:18] through so many struggles in life with
[1:03:21] the perfect person you marry, with the
[1:03:23] perfect children you have, with all
[1:03:25] those things. You're going to go through
[1:03:27] all those troubles because you're
[1:03:28] sitting around doing nothing
[1:03:33] and yet you're so busy.
[1:03:37] Ask anyone how busy they are. Everyone's
[1:03:40] busier than the other person.
[1:03:43] But he's always seeking us for one
[1:03:46] purpose. John 15:16.
[1:03:50] You have not chosen me. I have chosen
[1:03:52] you and ordained you that you should go
[1:03:56] and bring forth fruit. What fruit? Oh,
[1:03:59] love, joy, peace, fruits of the spirit.
[1:04:01] Listen, you're all failing in that.
[1:04:05] Love, joy, peace, longsuffering. Really?
[1:04:08] You can't even be longsuffering with
[1:04:10] your wife.
[1:04:12] Don't tell me you got FRUITS OF THE
[1:04:13] SPIRIT. DON'T EVEN GO TO GIFTS. Talk
[1:04:16] about fruits of the spirit. Love, joy,
[1:04:18] joy. Oh my goodness. The amount of
[1:04:21] depressed, sad faces, wimpy little
[1:04:24] complainers in this message, IT'S
[1:04:26] UNBELIEVABLE. WHERE'S THE JOY, FRUITS OF
[1:04:28] THE SPIRIT? I'M SO HAPPY IN THE LORD AND
[1:04:30] HIS WORD. I NEED NOTHING ELSE. JUST YOUR
[1:04:33] WORD, LORD, IS MAKING ME REJOICE. Where
[1:04:35] is that?
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; No. So, what's the real fruit? You're
[1:04:40] supposed to bring forth
[1:04:43] other sons.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; I've chosen you to bring forth sons.
[1:04:49] Where are those sons? No, you know, I'm
[1:04:52] not called to be a preacher.
[1:04:55] I'm not called to be a minister. I'm not
[1:04:57] called to be an evangelist. You know, I
[1:04:58] can't even speak. You sound a bit like
[1:05:00] Moses. You know, Lord, I'm of a
[1:05:01] stammering tongue. No, it's not my Oh,
[1:05:04] I'm a sister in the church. You know,
[1:05:06] I'm just called to be a housewife. I
[1:05:08] can't be anything other than that, you
[1:05:09] know.
[1:05:12] Please don't give me that. You lovely
[1:05:15] sisters who can't talk about the word
[1:05:18] can use the phone and social media to
[1:05:20] talk about everything else.
[1:05:23] Don't lie to me.
[1:05:25] You're on the phones every single day
[1:05:28] talking about nothing that brings forth
[1:05:30] sons.
[1:05:34] You you say you are called brothers and
[1:05:37] sisters. Every word that you speak as a
[1:05:41] son, we're talking about becoming sons.
[1:05:44] We're talking about the story of God and
[1:05:45] man. Don't forget, you're going to leave
[1:05:48] this church service. You're going to go
[1:05:50] straight back home while you're eating
[1:05:52] your biryani. You're going to be looking
[1:05:53] at Facebook and looking at all things.
[1:05:56] Huh? Or watching YouTube videos while
[1:05:59] you gulping away at your at your lunch
[1:06:01] and catching up with it. Where's the
[1:06:03] bringing forth sons?
[1:06:08] H where's the testimony? Where's the
[1:06:10] witness? Where's the words of
[1:06:13] edification that's reaching souls?
[1:06:18] This is where we are right now. This is
[1:06:20] why the message church is in the
[1:06:22] situation that it is because we've
[1:06:24] accepted this way of life.
[1:06:27] He's supposed to be salty,
[1:06:29] right? He told the disciples that he
[1:06:31] chose them to bring forth fruit. When he
[1:06:34] told the disciples to bring forth fruit,
[1:06:36] what did they do?
[1:06:39] They baptized 3,000 people in one day.
[1:06:42] They went forth to towns. They went
[1:06:44] forth talking the gospel. They went
[1:06:46] forth spreading the gospel. That is
[1:06:47] bringing forth fruit. See, and that your
[1:06:51] fruit should remain that whatsoever
[1:06:52] shall ask of the father in my name, he
[1:06:54] may give it to you.
[1:06:57] When do you apply that? Oh, for a job,
[1:07:01] for something I need.
[1:07:05] This is the thing. This is this is THE
[1:07:06] PENTECOSTAL IDEA. WHATEVER YOU ASK OF me
[1:07:09] and you go to these these these
[1:07:11] meetings, YOU GOT SUGAR DIABETES, YOU
[1:07:13] ASK GOD NOW. AND THEY THEY CLAIM THE
[1:07:16] SCRIPT JOHN 15:16. WHATEVER YOU ASK IN
[1:07:18] MY NAME, THE FATHER WILL GIVE YOU.
[1:07:21] NO, he won't. If you're still eating all
[1:07:24] that sugar, why should he heal you of
[1:07:26] sugar diabetes?
[1:07:28] If you're still eating all that
[1:07:29] cholesterol, if you're still doing
[1:07:31] living irresponsibly, why should he just
[1:07:33] suddenly Oh, my poor child. He's
[1:07:34] suffering.
[1:07:39] No, this is not about that.
[1:07:42] This is when you have purpose. This is
[1:07:45] when you're actually laboring for a soul
[1:07:47] like like Paul has to take a boat across
[1:07:49] to an island to go and speak to some
[1:07:52] savages to talk to them about Christ and
[1:07:54] there's something wrong in the boat and
[1:07:56] it's got a hole in there and there's
[1:07:58] coming water inside and there he says,
[1:08:00] "Lord, I need to get to that island."
[1:08:02] That's when he's going to answer.
[1:08:05] That's what the scripture is about. Not
[1:08:07] your sugar diabetes,
[1:08:09] not your high blood pressure and
[1:08:10] cholesterol and all that. You're doing
[1:08:13] that to yourself for no reason.
[1:08:19] Amen. It's not just sons that are in and
[1:08:22] out. We want sons that remain. We want
[1:08:26] predestinated sons. In other words, they
[1:08:28] would be the ways that God would
[1:08:32] you would become what are you supposed
[1:08:34] to become? You are supposed to become
[1:08:36] the way that God finds other sons.
[1:08:40] Are you with me? And what are you going
[1:08:43] to bring to them? The word.
[1:08:47] So, how did God seek us? God sought us
[1:08:51] by his word.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's his only way. So you might
[1:08:56] think there could be better ways. You
[1:08:59] could be wrong because you don't have
[1:09:01] the ability to think it through
[1:09:03] thoroughly. He sends his word for the
[1:09:05] day. You might think, "I need to go
[1:09:08] around killing everybody. I need to go
[1:09:11] around telling everybody the prophecy.
[1:09:14] You go around shouting out there in the
[1:09:16] streets, California is going to sink."
[1:09:19] See how well that's going to do. OR THE
[1:09:22] VATICAN IS THE BEAST of Revelations 13.
[1:09:27] People don't want to hear that. People
[1:09:30] are not interested. They'll just think
[1:09:31] you're another YouTube hoax.
[1:09:34] That's all. They're not going to be
[1:09:35] interested in triple 6 anymore and all
[1:09:38] because if you go to YouTube, you'll
[1:09:40] find out all the numerous things that
[1:09:42] are far more attractive about that than
[1:09:44] you could ever have.
[1:09:48] People want an answer to the question in
[1:09:51] their soul which they don't even know
[1:09:53] what the question is.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; How can you answer a question? And this
[1:09:59] is God does, right? It's like
[1:10:01] Nebuchadnezzar has a dream and forgets
[1:10:02] his dream. Now Daniel has to tell him
[1:10:05] his dream and interpret it.
[1:10:10] I know this to be true. I'm one of those
[1:10:12] people. If I have a dream, I don't know
[1:10:13] what I dreamt the next day. literally
[1:10:15] forget about completely. I think I wake
[1:10:18] up in the real world already so awake.
[1:10:22] Whatever happened in the night is is
[1:10:23] just blank. I'm one of those people. So
[1:10:27] the law dispensation, what was the law
[1:10:29] of Moses and the whole dispensation? It
[1:10:31] was God seeking his people bringing the
[1:10:34] word right to find them. The five-fold
[1:10:39] ministry of today is God seeking. The
[1:10:42] seven messengers of the church ages was
[1:10:44] God seeking,
[1:10:46] right?
[1:10:47] So that if the seed being planted in us
[1:10:50] by the word would take hold, it will
[1:10:53] produce one thing that brings about
[1:10:55] predestination and adoption and the
[1:10:57] process the road to adoption that we
[1:10:58] spoke about. Are you ready for this? So
[1:11:01] when God finds you
[1:11:04] by the word, what happens? An instant
[1:11:08] reaction takes place.
[1:11:10] You start searching for him.
[1:11:14] He sought you so you can find him.
[1:11:18] Because now what must happen is every
[1:11:20] day of your life is you finding him. You
[1:11:23] finding God. So if God finds you through
[1:11:26] his word, where are you going to find
[1:11:29] him? Through his word. What's going to
[1:11:32] happen? If you if he finds you through
[1:11:35] the word, you are going to try to find
[1:11:37] him via the same source.
[1:11:41] That's how it works. So which means
[1:11:43] you're not going to rest. You're going
[1:11:44] to keep going back to the source when So
[1:11:47] this guy in the plane sitting there and
[1:11:49] he starts talking about the word and he
[1:11:50] says, "Okay, you mean all that's in this
[1:11:52] book?" "Oh, yeah, it's in the book. Can
[1:11:54] I have the book?" "Oh, sure." And then
[1:11:56] the guy says, "There's more books."
[1:11:59] "Oh, where can I get these books?" He
[1:12:01] doesn't even know what's happened to him
[1:12:03] right now. But he's now going to do
[1:12:06] everything in his power to find God
[1:12:08] after God found him.
[1:12:11] You're only going to find God through
[1:12:13] the very same word that he found you
[1:12:16] with.
[1:12:17] That's how we're talking about becoming
[1:12:20] sons. We're talking about the story of
[1:12:22] God and man. We're talking about how you
[1:12:24] are going to achieve the purpose that he
[1:12:26] called you for. If he found you with his
[1:12:29] word, you will have to find him through
[1:12:31] the very same word. This is why God
[1:12:35] finds you and then you think, "Yeah,
[1:12:38] this message is not really for me." Good
[1:12:40] luck.
[1:12:42] That's all I have to say.
[1:12:45] To seek God, to truly seek God was never
[1:12:49] in our nature because fallen nature was
[1:12:51] diseased with selfishness and pride. We
[1:12:54] would never know where to seek for God
[1:12:56] in the first place. Once we hear the
[1:12:59] word and then we go to the source and we
[1:13:02] begin to seek. That's how it works.
[1:13:04] Unless you receive the word for your
[1:13:06] day. Like it's like God calls you
[1:13:09] through the message, then you go to
[1:13:11] Luther. That's not the source.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; You're not going to find him there. God
[1:13:16] calls you through the message and you're
[1:13:18] going to go to Pentecost. God called you
[1:13:20] the message under the seventh seal and
[1:13:22] you want to go try and find the coming
[1:13:23] of the Lord through Pentecost.
[1:13:26] You're not going to get it. See, you
[1:13:28] have to go back to the source. Like
[1:13:31] people today who want to understand the
[1:13:32] coming of the Lord but refuse to read
[1:13:34] the seven seal message, the breach
[1:13:36] message, and all other things that
[1:13:38] pertain to that. But you want to think
[1:13:40] you can understand it. You don't want to
[1:13:42] read the rapture message, but you want
[1:13:43] to know what the seven seal is.
[1:13:47] Every person I know who desired that
[1:13:50] seven seal and went to find it through
[1:13:53] that got it.
[1:13:58] So here's the thing. This is another
[1:14:00] phenomenon. They seek and they find not.
[1:14:05] Proverbs 1:28. Then shall they call upon
[1:14:07] me but I will not answer.
[1:14:10] They shall seek me early but they shall
[1:14:12] not find me.
[1:14:14] John 4:22, "You worship, you know not
[1:14:18] what we know what we worship. For
[1:14:21] salvation is of the Jews." This is where
[1:14:24] he's speaking to the woman at the well.
[1:14:25] She's a Samaritan. He He is of the Jews.
[1:14:28] He's saying, "We you worship, but you
[1:14:30] don't know what you're worshiping."
[1:14:33] That's kind of like what people in the
[1:14:35] world do, right? They think they're
[1:14:37] serving God, but they don't know what
[1:14:38] they what what they're serving. So, what
[1:14:40] does this tell us? We just told you that
[1:14:42] man cannot seek God, right? So here's
[1:14:44] the the phenomenon that happened.
[1:14:47] We told you man cannot seek God unless
[1:14:49] God finds him first. Are you with me?
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; So how are these people seeking him and
[1:14:54] not find him?
[1:14:56] What happened? So here is the tragedy of
[1:14:59] human nature. So when the world saw
[1:15:04] Jesus Christ and the disciples and the
[1:15:07] first church that came out, when the
[1:15:09] world saw the Levitical order, Moses and
[1:15:13] the children of the wilderness and
[1:15:15] Joshua and them in the promised land and
[1:15:17] they saw them carrying this ark, the
[1:15:19] world said, "Let's make our ark.
[1:15:23] Let's make our own ark." So there there
[1:15:25] arose this ark cult in the time of the
[1:15:29] ark of the covenant.
[1:15:31] Everybody was making arcs and then they
[1:15:33] all started having these priesthoods and
[1:15:35] sacrifices. So in the same way when the
[1:15:38] world started seeing like Constantine
[1:15:40] when he saw the Christians and all that
[1:15:42] they were doing in Rome, he said I want
[1:15:43] that. We need that politically. We need
[1:15:46] that. So let's try and let's try and
[1:15:48] absorb this into our let's try and and
[1:15:52] what happened? So in other words, people
[1:15:55] see you finding God and then they think
[1:15:59] they can search for him on their own.
[1:16:01] But God has not found them.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; So what man does is he sees other people
[1:16:06] finding and tries to copy that.
[1:16:10] That young people want to be baptized.
[1:16:12] Don't do that.
[1:16:15] You have to know the word has made an
[1:16:16] impression in your heart first. God has
[1:16:18] found you. Now you must find him. What
[1:16:22] I've been doing in the last four parts
[1:16:24] of the series is preaching something
[1:16:27] that could lead you to find him. Amen.
[1:16:31] And how do you find him? Because you're
[1:16:33] going to find yourself in him.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; That's what this is about. Finding
[1:16:38] myself in him is what this whole thing
[1:16:40] is about. Amen. Seeing my name in the
[1:16:42] book.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Do you see your name in the book? So
[1:16:46] when man seeks God without God finding
[1:16:48] him first, he's only seeking the concept
[1:16:50] of God. by other men. His true desire is
[1:16:53] not even God. He doesn't even know what
[1:16:55] he seeks and his soul doesn't even
[1:16:57] desire to worship.
[1:17:00] So men are going after religion. Men see
[1:17:02] you in the message. They see this life
[1:17:04] that you live. They see what you're
[1:17:06] doing and they feel like let we can do
[1:17:08] what they do. Look, they they look so
[1:17:10] happy. They've got their children sorted
[1:17:12] out. They've got these children that sit
[1:17:14] through a 2-hour service. That's
[1:17:15] amazing.
[1:17:17] They're so well behaved in the church.
[1:17:19] you know, they don't need uh kids corner
[1:17:21] and coffee shop in their church. These
[1:17:23] these kids just sit there and they
[1:17:25] listen to the word. It's amazing, you
[1:17:26] know, and the kids are well behaved and
[1:17:28] they dress so well and they're not
[1:17:30] worldly and that sounds like a perfect
[1:17:32] place to settle down.
[1:17:36] Scary truth is many call on him and he
[1:17:41] will not answer.
[1:17:44] Many will call on God and even do
[1:17:46] service to him and to an idea of him and
[1:17:50] even receive great results from it
[1:17:52] because if you live righteous according
[1:17:54] to the word for your day, you receive
[1:17:56] the the benefits of it. Remember all
[1:17:59] that I preached during co about benefits
[1:18:01] of the message. Now I'm saying even if
[1:18:04] you don't believe in the message but you
[1:18:06] just live the message, there are amazing
[1:18:07] benefits.
[1:18:11] Even if you don't believe the Bible and
[1:18:12] just follow the principles of the Bible,
[1:18:14] there are amazing benefits. Our country
[1:18:16] is benefiting from the Bible. America is
[1:18:19] benefiting. The whole world is
[1:18:20] benefiting from the Bible and they don't
[1:18:22] believe it
[1:18:24] and they won't admit it. The scary truth
[1:18:27] is they'll call on God. They'll do
[1:18:30] service to him. They'll even have great
[1:18:32] results, but it is not he that is
[1:18:34] communicating with them because they are
[1:18:36] not even calling on him in the first
[1:18:38] place.
[1:18:40] They are they were they were not a part
[1:18:42] of him to begin with. He did not seek
[1:18:44] them through his word. They were trying
[1:18:47] to seek him first which no man can do.
[1:18:50] Is that right? Those are workers of
[1:18:53] iniquity because they are seeking God
[1:18:55] with ulterior motives.
[1:18:58] You cannot call on God unless he finds
[1:19:00] you first. Are you with us? Now these
[1:19:02] people who seek God, they're doing it
[1:19:04] with ulterior motives to satisfy a
[1:19:06] conscience, their conscience, to find a
[1:19:08] better way of life, to satisfy
[1:19:10] knowledge. Many of us have this sense of
[1:19:12] finding purpose in our existence on
[1:19:14] earth. And we believe that we must be a
[1:19:17] god because we couldn't have uh or they
[1:19:20] believe that maybe Jesus Christ is God.
[1:19:23] There must be a god somewhere because we
[1:19:25] couldn't have arrived here by accident.
[1:19:28] So there must be that's not a reason
[1:19:30] enough to worship him, right? Even
[1:19:33] evolution does not satisfy your
[1:19:35] questions and you're thinking surely he
[1:19:38] there is a god because evolution is is
[1:19:40] false and we see all these new evidence
[1:19:42] and others who search for him do so
[1:19:45] because they have heard of him from
[1:19:47] generations past. So those of you want
[1:19:51] to be baptized, do you want to be
[1:19:52] baptized because it's what your parents
[1:19:54] did?
[1:19:57] Do you want to be baptized because
[1:20:00] uh of how brother Al preaches and and he
[1:20:03] he's convincing you that it's good to be
[1:20:05] baptized. Is that why you want to be
[1:20:07] baptized?
[1:20:10] Amen.
[1:20:12] So, we look for a source to God. And
[1:20:16] here's here's the real problem with
[1:20:18] people today. They look for a source to
[1:20:21] God that is a convenient source.
[1:20:25] God's word is not convenient. I said
[1:20:27] this to you before. God's word is very
[1:20:30] inconvenient.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; I love it. But the word, you know, I
[1:20:35] love it when the word disrupts me
[1:20:40] because that's when I need to wake up. H
[1:20:43] But the word teaches us that nobody can
[1:20:46] ever search for him unless he first
[1:20:48] calls. Because without his call, you
[1:20:51] don't even know where to look.
[1:20:54] Right?
[1:20:55] You should
[1:20:58] you should spend some time in nature.
[1:21:01] You know, next holiday you have, don't
[1:21:04] go book some resort on the beach. Don't
[1:21:07] go book some place where you're going to
[1:21:09] waste your money and come back and
[1:21:10] regret it. Go book on a farm with
[1:21:14] animals and no Wi-Fi.
[1:21:18] Go milk some cows and feed some goats
[1:21:21] and just enjoy nature.
[1:21:24] And you'll see some things.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; You'll see how when a little lamb is
[1:21:29] born and he's going and he's bleeding
[1:21:32] and and his mother is somewhere and he
[1:21:34] doesn't know unless he hears a call, he
[1:21:36] does not know where to look. He
[1:21:38] literally will lose himself in the worst
[1:21:40] possible place.
[1:21:43] Somebody sent me a and I think I might
[1:21:46] have sent it to my my kids as well. I'm
[1:21:47] not sure. this fellow, this fish just
[1:21:51] kept swimming out onto the bank. It was
[1:21:54] in shallow water and uh the caption says
[1:21:58] like God always trying to save me and
[1:22:01] every time his fellow picks up this fish
[1:22:03] and puts it back in the water, it swims
[1:22:04] back on the bank.
[1:22:06] And then because it can't find its way
[1:22:08] out of shallow water and then he he like
[1:22:11] this guy is so frustrated of putting
[1:22:13] this fish in the water and he keeps
[1:22:14] swimming back and getting stuck in the
[1:22:15] bank.
[1:22:19] That's you.
[1:22:23] That's what happened. We must keep
[1:22:25] putting you back in the water and you
[1:22:26] keep getting stuck all over again. If
[1:22:29] God does not call, you cannot answer.
[1:22:32] That's what I'm saying. Get out there in
[1:22:34] nature. Actually learn something. You
[1:22:36] actually come back more relaxed and
[1:22:37] realize, you know what? I'm going back
[1:22:39] to that farm. I didn't have to spend
[1:22:41] 10,000 rand on rides for my kids.
[1:22:45] ungrateful creatures go on the right and
[1:22:47] still come back and hate me.
[1:22:52] H take all the pictures and selfies with
[1:22:54] them all happy and you don't know what
[1:22:55] else frustration of a day. It was just
[1:22:58] waking them up in the morning and
[1:23:00] dressing them in their clothes and
[1:23:01] taking them for rides and entertainment
[1:23:03] and they come back and I'm hungry. I
[1:23:06] hate you.
[1:23:10] End up with your holiday not even being
[1:23:11] worth it. Take them to the farm and make
[1:23:14] them work.
[1:23:16] You could become a Christian. You might
[1:23:18] even become a message believer based on
[1:23:20] logical reason. But if he didn't call
[1:23:23] you first, you will never even know
[1:23:25] where to look and you will never find
[1:23:27] him.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. God desires us. This is what I
[1:23:31] love. God wants to be found of us.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; That's the last step in this u this
[1:23:39] thought. Jeremiah 29:11-4. For I know
[1:23:43] the thoughts I think toward you. Just
[1:23:47] take some time to
[1:23:50] absorb that. I know the thoughts I think
[1:23:52] towards you, say the Lord. Thoughts of
[1:23:55] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:23:58] expected end. An expected end means the
[1:24:02] right consequences.
[1:24:04] Okay? Then shall you call upon me and
[1:24:07] you shall go and pray unto me and I will
[1:24:10] hearken unto you and you shall seek me
[1:24:13] and find me when you shall have when you
[1:24:17] shall search for me with all your heart
[1:24:20] and I will be found of you. God's not
[1:24:24] going to hide it. This is why you know
[1:24:25] when I preached the book of Revelations,
[1:24:27] I said this is a book of revelations,
[1:24:30] NOT A BOOK OF HIDING. Oh yeah.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't write it to confuse you. He
[1:24:35] didn't WRITE IT ALL DIFFICULT TO
[1:24:37] UNDERSTAND. IT'S DIFFICULT TO understand
[1:24:38] because of you.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; Your thinking it's actually so easy.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; I mean literally call the book
[1:24:47] revelation and nobody understands it
[1:24:49] today.
[1:24:52] I will be found of you said the lord and
[1:24:54] I will turn away your captivity. I will
[1:24:57] gather you from all the nations from all
[1:24:59] the places where I've driven you said
[1:25:00] the Lord. and I will bring you again
[1:25:02] unto the place where I cause you to be
[1:25:03] carried away captive. So here's the
[1:25:06] process.
[1:25:07] His thoughts of us will be manifested by
[1:25:09] his thoughts finding us. I know the
[1:25:12] thoughts I have for you of you. Right?
[1:25:16] That's the first part. Then shall you
[1:25:18] call upon me. So without his thoughts
[1:25:20] first manifested, you won't be able to
[1:25:23] call. But then you shall call on me.
[1:25:26] Then shall you search for me and I will
[1:25:29] be found of you. I will make myself
[1:25:31] available.
[1:25:33] If you search for me with all your
[1:25:35] heart, through the very same word that I
[1:25:37] found you through, I shall be found of
[1:25:40] you. You will receive that reward. You
[1:25:43] will find me if you search for the
[1:25:45] seventh seal with the RIGHT HEART. YOU
[1:25:48] WILL FIND IT.
[1:25:51] He desires us to seek him. Right? And
[1:25:53] it's no secret.
[1:25:56] Even Christ said it. John 7:33-36. Then
[1:25:59] Jesus said unto them, "Yet a little
[1:26:01] while I'm with you, and then I go unto
[1:26:03] him that sent me. You shall seek me and
[1:26:06] shall not find me, and where I am, so
[1:26:09] that you cannot come." Then he said,
[1:26:11] "The Jews among themselves, whether will
[1:26:13] he go that we cannot find him." Will he
[1:26:15] go into the dispersed among the Gentiles
[1:26:17] and teach the Gentiles? Wow.
[1:26:20] They actually added half right there,
[1:26:23] right?
[1:26:26] What manner of saying is this that he
[1:26:27] said you shall seek me and shall not
[1:26:29] find me and where I am till the you
[1:26:31] cannot come. A lot of people said well
[1:26:33] he's going to heaven they won't be able
[1:26:34] to find him in heaven. They had it half
[1:26:36] right. He was going to a place that they
[1:26:40] didn't believe was the source of God. He
[1:26:43] was going in among the Gentiles.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; The church was heading in that direction
[1:26:48] and the Jews would not follow them. They
[1:26:51] would still be searching FOR GOD WHERE
[1:26:53] THEY could not find him.
[1:26:56] He was speaking to the Jews here. The
[1:26:58] Jews enjoyed being the people of God for
[1:27:00] 2,000 years. They were halfright. He
[1:27:03] went among the Gentiles where the Jews
[1:27:04] were unable to follow. Their way of
[1:27:06] finding God had ended.
[1:27:11] Why? Because God had moved into a new
[1:27:13] dispensation. Now they did everything
[1:27:16] they COULD AND COULD NOT FIND HIM.
[1:27:19] WHY? Because I am the way, the truth,
[1:27:22] and the life. No man comes to the father
[1:27:26] but by me. After Christ that changed
[1:27:30] which means even if those Jewish people
[1:27:31] knew God by the previous way of finding
[1:27:34] him there was now a new way. He was the
[1:27:37] way right? So he was the source. If they
[1:27:41] wanted to they had to come to that
[1:27:43] source
[1:27:45] they would search and they would not
[1:27:46] find him. But what I'm saying is even
[1:27:49] Christ said it. I am going away. You
[1:27:53] shall seek me and you shall not find me.
[1:27:56] Isn't that incredible?
[1:27:59] So what beautiful pattern we see of
[1:28:01] finding and seeking and finding in here
[1:28:04] again finding, seeking and finding.
[1:28:07] Christ came to find mankind and plant
[1:28:11] the seed. He sought and found the church
[1:28:14] and then he left so that we could find
[1:28:17] him.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Right? Those who were truly genuine and
[1:28:21] loved him would have found him. They
[1:28:23] would have find they would find him by
[1:28:24] seeking the will of God and searching
[1:28:26] for the word. Truthfully, the Jews could
[1:28:28] not follow into the dispensation of
[1:28:30] grace as they stayed with the law of
[1:28:32] Moses. They would never find him again
[1:28:34] until he finds them in the three and a
[1:28:36] half year tribulation.
[1:28:39] Is that right?
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; To this day, they cannot find him.
[1:28:42] They're still waiting for the Messiah.
[1:28:45] Proverbs 8 and verse 17. I love them
[1:28:48] that love me, and those that seek me
[1:28:50] early shall find me. Deuteronomy 4:29.
[1:28:54] But if from thenst thou shalt seek the
[1:28:56] Lord thy God, thou shalt find him. If
[1:28:58] thou seek him with all thy heart, with
[1:29:00] all thy soul. Once God has sought you
[1:29:02] and found you, you will search for him
[1:29:04] with all your heart, you will find him.
[1:29:07] But without faith, it is impossible to
[1:29:09] please him. For he that cometh to God
[1:29:11] must believe that he is, and that he is
[1:29:13] a rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:29:15] him.
[1:29:18] So young people,
[1:29:21] you want to get baptized,
[1:29:24] what are you promising?
[1:29:28] You're what what you're saying is if
[1:29:29] you're saying I want to be baptized,
[1:29:31] what you're saying is I believe God has
[1:29:32] found me.
[1:29:34] I understand the process of science.
[1:29:37] What am I promising to do? I'm promising
[1:29:39] from this day on to search for him.
[1:29:42] I am promising that from this day on
[1:29:44] with every day that I live, I want to
[1:29:47] find him. I want to never stop searching
[1:29:50] for him because he found me so that I
[1:29:52] could find him.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; So if you make that promise when you get
[1:29:57] baptized, you make that promise. That's
[1:29:58] what I want to do. You got to stay true
[1:30:00] to that every day of your life. Every
[1:30:03] time you come to church, every time you
[1:30:04] read the Bible, every time you're you're
[1:30:06] you're with us on the Zoom service on
[1:30:08] Wednesday, you're with us on Sundays, I
[1:30:10] am finding him. I That's my desire.
[1:30:13] Every time I come to church, I want to
[1:30:14] find him. Lord, let me find you. If you
[1:30:17] get you in the morning, your head is
[1:30:18] bowed, the music is praying. There's one
[1:30:20] thing you pray for. Lord, let me find
[1:30:22] you today.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Lord, let me find you today. You wake up
[1:30:26] in the morning, you're praying to God,
[1:30:27] you open the Bible. Lord, let me find
[1:30:29] you. What do you want to find? the
[1:30:32] divine nature of God. You found me, let
[1:30:36] me find you. Amen. Hebrews 11:6, he is a
[1:30:40] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[1:30:42] him. If you find him, you will receive
[1:30:44] that reward. Amen. So, we're not just
[1:30:48] going to get baptized and then go back
[1:30:50] to school, university, go back to work,
[1:30:52] and then just, well, I got baptized and
[1:30:54] just go live the same old life and never
[1:30:56] search for him.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; Right? That means God didn't even find
[1:31:00] you in the first place.
[1:31:02] So, one of in closing, one of the
[1:31:05] greatest secrets to predestination is
[1:31:07] this. Those who diligently seek him with
[1:31:11] all their heart and their soul, who love
[1:31:14] him and believe that he is are those who
[1:31:16] he has sought and found. This is why
[1:31:19] predestination sounds unfair. He seeks
[1:31:22] those who are his. Only those who are
[1:31:25] his will,
[1:31:27] who are his will, will respond
[1:31:29] correctly. They will seek him and they
[1:31:31] will find him. Christ was God finding
[1:31:35] mankind. John 3:16. For God so loved the
[1:31:38] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:31:40] that whosoever might believe shall have
[1:31:43] everlasting life.
[1:31:45] Who was the Lord Jesus Christ? He was
[1:31:48] God seeking man.
[1:31:52] God finding man. Who is the bride?
[1:31:56] Man finding God.
[1:32:00] Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; He sought us that we might find him.
[1:32:05] They You could never find him unless he
[1:32:07] found you. Is that right? Look at all
[1:32:09] the types in the Bible. God found them
[1:32:11] first. Is that right? God found Abraham.
[1:32:14] Then Abraham went to find him. Abram was
[1:32:17] searching for a city whose BUILDER AND
[1:32:18] MAKER WAS GOD. RIGHT? But God found him
[1:32:21] first. LOOK AT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.
[1:32:23] It had to be that way.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; So this is the this is the reason and I
[1:32:28] don't want to preach on this today, but
[1:32:29] this is why Calvinism and Armenianism is
[1:32:33] wrong because some people believe in God
[1:32:37] finding.
[1:32:38] That's where they stop. Others believe
[1:32:40] in me finding God. So you got Calvinism,
[1:32:44] Calvinism, and Armenianism. It's got to
[1:32:46] be God searching for you and you
[1:32:48] searching for God.
[1:32:51] It's is it God's work alone? No. Is it
[1:32:54] my work alone? No. He seeks me and finds
[1:32:59] me. That's his work. I seek him and I
[1:33:03] find him. That's my work.
[1:33:07] That's the middle of the road to
[1:33:08] predestination.
[1:33:10] That seeking and finding happens every
[1:33:13] day with each revelation of the word
[1:33:16] that drops in. It's like you know when
[1:33:19] revelation hits you and then you realize
[1:33:21] I don't know anything
[1:33:25] right and then you go searching for it
[1:33:27] and then you find it
[1:33:29] right but unless the revelation hit like
[1:33:32] when when he said to them whom do men
[1:33:34] say that I am and Peter said that was
[1:33:35] the Christ the son of the living God and
[1:33:36] Christ Jesus said to him there's no way
[1:33:38] you knew that my father which is in
[1:33:41] heaven had revealed because flesh and
[1:33:42] blood cannot reveal that to you
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; right and then Peter still had to find
[1:33:47] him.
[1:33:50] Amen. And that is how it works today,
[1:33:53] saints. That is becoming sons. This is
[1:33:56] the story of God and man. He sought us
[1:33:59] that we might find you. Never lose
[1:34:00] consciousness of that. It's a that's a
[1:34:03] such a simple
[1:34:06] uh u subject, such a simple
[1:34:08] understanding to have, but it's one we
[1:34:10] lose focus of every day because we get
[1:34:13] sucked up into what this world affords.
[1:34:15] Let's never lose that focus. He finds us
[1:34:18] with his word. We search for him through
[1:34:21] that word. He sought us so we can find
[1:34:24] him. So to a believer, it's the most
[1:34:26] wonderful experience that just keeps on
[1:34:28] happening. Amen.
