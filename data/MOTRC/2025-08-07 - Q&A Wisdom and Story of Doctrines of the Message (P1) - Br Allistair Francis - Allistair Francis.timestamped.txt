[0:05] Uh so Matthew 15 verse1-14
[0:10] then came Jesus to scribes and Pharisees
[0:14] which were of Jerusalem saying why do
[0:18] thy disciples transgress the the
[0:20] tradition of the elders for they wash
[0:22] not their hands when they eat bread? But
[0:26] he answered and said unto them, Why do
[0:28] you also transgress the commandment of
[0:31] God by your tradition?
[0:34] For God commanded, saying, "Honor thy
[0:37] father and mother, and he that cursth
[0:40] father or mother, let him die the
[0:42] death." But you say, "Whosoever shall
[0:45] say to his father or his mother, it is a
[0:47] gift. by whatsoever thou minest be
[0:50] profited by me and honor not his father
[0:53] or his mother, he shall be free. Thus
[0:56] have you made the commandment of God of
[0:59] none effect by your tradition. Notice he
[1:02] only gives one example of a commandment
[1:05] that was made of none effect. Verse
[1:08] seven, you hypocrites.
[1:11] Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
[1:14] "This people draw nigh or close unto me
[1:18] with their mouth, and honor me with
[1:20] their lips, but their heart is far from
[1:24] me." But in vain they do worship me,
[1:27] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:29] of men. Uh, and he called the multitude
[1:32] and said unto them, and understand,
[1:36] not that which goeth into the mouth
[1:38] defileth man, but that which cometh out
[1:41] of the mouth? This defileth a man?
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Then came his disciples, and said unto
[1:46] him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees
[1:49] were offended
[1:52] after they heard the saying?
[1:55] Right? But he answered and said, uh,
[1:59] every plant which my heavenly father
[2:01] hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let
[2:05] them alone. They be blind leaders of the
[2:08] blind, and the blind lead the blind.
[2:10] Both shall fall into the ditch. The Lord
[2:13] bless the reading of his word. You may
[2:14] be seated. We can keep that scripture up
[2:17] for a little bit.
[2:20] So once again, greetings in the name of
[2:22] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:26] And uh certainly good to be with you
[2:29] this morning. Like we said, we have uh
[2:32] so many people
[2:35] ill and uh not here this morning, but uh
[2:38] good to see those of you who could make
[2:40] it. And we trust that the word will be a
[2:42] blessing to you. And uh so I want to
[2:47] let's go to the title page.
[2:50] I want this is going to be question and
[2:52] answers 2025.
[2:54] and a long longish title, the wisdom and
[2:58] story of diverse doctrines of the
[3:00] message at the coming of Christ.
[3:04] So just to give you the introduction to
[3:06] this, I've received a question on the
[3:10] doctrines of the message and I've been
[3:12] asked this question. So, I I've been
[3:15] doing a lot of answering of questions in
[3:17] the past few uh uh weeks, but so
[3:22] this is something that's been on my
[3:24] heart for a long time. I just did never
[3:26] got the chance or the opportunity to do
[3:28] this, but I'm trusting that the Lord
[3:30] will will open up our hearts to be able
[3:34] to understand us properly. And I want to
[3:38] do this particularly for this new
[3:40] generation and also the older generation
[3:44] also um the young people coming up
[3:48] because uh as most of you would remember
[3:51] the prophet spoke about the third and
[3:54] fourth generation.
[3:56] If you remember, he says how the word
[3:58] comes in like the people came out of
[4:01] Egypt and they had Moses who was this uh
[4:05] this great prophet and uh this movement
[4:09] took place where this prophet begin to
[4:11] take these people with him towards the
[4:13] promised land and on the way you you you
[4:17] I mean you've got this great prophet
[4:19] right you see these plagues that strike
[4:22] Egypt and uh then he takes him through
[4:25] through the wilderness
[4:26] The moment difficult times come against
[4:28] them, they begin to faint and that means
[4:33] like uh fall uh their faith begins to to
[4:38] diminish and uh factions
[4:43] uh groups start to form within them.
[4:46] They move towards the promised land and
[4:48] you have Kora, Day and Abram. Then comes
[4:50] the ministry of Balum and then they get
[4:53] mixed up with the Moabites and and all
[4:55] this occurs and then when it comes time
[4:57] to be the opening of the seven seal to
[4:59] cross over Jordan and take the land that
[5:01] was promised by the ministry of the
[5:03] prophet then they don't want to cross
[5:05] over.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; Then they spent 40 years walking in this
[5:09] wilderness just because they didn't want
[5:11] to cross over. And uh if you translate
[5:14] all that to this day, it's like
[5:16] basically they're afraid to cross over
[5:20] uh they feel it's not the time or and
[5:23] and when it is the time, Joshua has to
[5:25] try and convince them to get over. And
[5:27] then the prophet even sends spies over
[5:30] and and says, "Go and check the land. Go
[5:32] and see it for yourself." And they come
[5:33] back and say, "Well, everything you said
[5:35] is true. It's beautiful. It's there."
[5:38] But they still don't want to break
[5:39] through. In other words, it's like
[5:40] fighting. the seventh seal is not open
[5:42] and a prophet is even saying it's open
[5:44] and you went there and you spied and you
[5:46] read and you looked at it, you have
[5:48] evidence of it and you still don't want
[5:50] to go over.
[5:51] &gt;&gt; So we see this in the Old Testament.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; And we see what's happened in our day. I
[5:56] just want to tell you it's a fantastic
[6:00] story. Amen.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to say a lot of things
[6:04] this morning and I want I want to let
[6:06] you know that if some of you have come
[6:09] from these doctrines, don't be hurt by
[6:12] what I'm saying. It's simply the truth.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; Right. And some of it can be hurtful.
[6:18] Some of it can bring remembrance or
[6:21] remembrance of uh scars or something
[6:24] that you might have been through or
[6:26] places that you you sat in and uh you
[6:30] felt things and you experienced things.
[6:32] Some of it will bring it back. Some of
[6:34] it may have been uh your parents were
[6:38] were part of some of these doctrines. Um
[6:42] we're getting quite a bit of feedback.
[6:44] if somebody could just sort this out
[6:46] because this buzzing is going off on. So
[6:48] if you just can I also want to just um
[6:51] say to those online in the Newcastle
[6:54] assembly uh we're being we're constantly
[6:58] having troubles here with the with the
[7:01] network and bandwidth. We're having
[7:03] issues with uh so the network we're
[7:05] using is Vodiccom in this place and for
[7:08] some reason on different days the
[7:10] network is okay and sometimes it's it's
[7:13] not. So um just bear with us. We do our
[7:17] best to try and bring it back. If it
[7:19] cuts it cuts there's nothing we can do
[7:21] about it except to try and bring it
[7:22] back. So just bear with us. if at some
[7:25] time we we have our own place where we
[7:27] have a nice fiber hardline through and
[7:30] you know you get uninterrupted Wi-Fi
[7:32] networks but for now this is our
[7:34] situation we don't have a permanent
[7:37] place of our own and we're we're um
[7:41] uh we're subject to these LTE networks
[7:44] so just bear with us all right so coming
[7:47] back to our thought
[7:50] just to to let you know I'm not going to
[7:52] be I'm not somebody who is standing here
[7:56] in 2025 looking back and criticizing
[8:00] what has happened in the past. That's
[8:01] never been my position. And you here in
[8:04] this church know me and I've always
[8:06] taught you to respect people. Respect
[8:09] your your elders and ministers who
[8:11] brought us this message. I hold that
[8:13] dear to my heart. So that's not what
[8:16] we're doing. But the prophet said coming
[8:19] back to it, he said when this group goes
[8:22] over into the promised land, the first
[8:25] generation is dead. The second
[8:27] generation is is there's remnants of it.
[8:30] Said then the third generation, the
[8:32] light begins to diminish. And then comes
[8:34] a fourth generation that has completely
[8:36] no knowledge of what happened. They
[8:39] don't even know about the struggles of
[8:41] the wilderness. They don't know the
[8:43] struggles of crossing over into Jordan.
[8:47] crossing over the Jordan into the
[8:48] promised land. They don't know the
[8:49] struggles that even happened. They're
[8:51] just born in the message.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; They appreciate nothing and they come to
[8:56] a point where they just point back at
[8:57] the elders and say they were all wrong.
[8:59] This one was wrong. That one was wrong.
[9:01] They never went through the experience.
[9:03] They do not appreciate the way. They
[9:05] don't even appreciate how they got to
[9:07] this land that they actually own this
[9:09] place. They don't appreciate anything.
[9:12] They don't know the histories. And
[9:14] eventually they just say, "Well, what's
[9:16] the problem?" You know, we can we can
[9:18] make leagues with uh with the
[9:20] Amalachites. We can make leagues with
[9:22] the uh Jeepites, with the Hivites, we
[9:25] can we can just do whatever we want to.
[9:27] And uh that was against the word. The
[9:30] word was do not make leagues with them.
[9:32] Do not mix with them. Do not do all of
[9:34] these things, right? And so it the word
[9:37] even tells you there arose a generation
[9:39] that did not even know Moses.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; And that's where we are today. Yeah.
[9:44] &gt;&gt; So, a whole lot of young people in the
[9:46] message who do not even have any
[9:49] patriotic feeling to the prophet.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; True.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; To the point of if you read things
[9:55] online, it's so easy for yourself just
[9:57] to cut yourself off and say, "I'm not
[10:00] interested in this."
[10:01] &gt;&gt; You know, I got no standing here. But
[10:04] you don't even realize why you are
[10:07] actually here. And that there are people
[10:09] who sweated blood and tears
[10:13] &gt;&gt; to get you to where you are. And there's
[10:15] there's some of you who sit back and
[10:17] say, "Well, my life was an absolute
[10:18] misery." Not even considering what your
[10:21] life could have been without this.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; True.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; So to me, that's what's important with
[10:28] knowing the story
[10:30] &gt;&gt; and understanding the development. Amen.
[10:33] That being said, when we you read the
[10:35] scripture, if we go back to the
[10:37] scripture uh that we read in the
[10:39] beginning from verse 1 through to 5,
[10:43] you're seeing the Lord Jesus and and
[10:46] it's actually identifying two different
[10:48] doctrinal groups here, scribes and
[10:51] Pharisees. Scribes were not really a
[10:53] doctrinal group. They were more an
[10:55] educated group. They were the only
[10:56] people in the world at the time who
[10:58] could read and write. Nobody else could.
[11:00] Right? So even those people that say you
[11:03] know Matthew wrote the book of Matthew
[11:05] or Luke wrote this one or that Mark
[11:07] wrote that one probably Mark was the
[11:10] only one who was a servant to a scribe
[11:12] who could write read and write. The
[11:14] others dictated and a scribe would write
[11:17] for them. So they were very educated
[11:20] people right the scribes. But then the
[11:21] Pharisees were an actual sect,
[11:26] right? An actual put it this way,
[11:28] denomination,
[11:30] religious group or doctrinal uh or a
[11:34] church with a doctrinal difference at
[11:37] the time of the first coming. So we are
[11:40] going to be dealing with the story and
[11:42] the wisdom of the doctrines at the
[11:45] second coming. Right? So, but the way to
[11:49] understand and look and approach this is
[11:51] look at the first coming. So, here in
[11:54] the first five verses, Christ is showing
[11:57] that doctrines are formed because of
[12:00] men's traditions.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; Right. So, they can claim all they want
[12:06] to that they got an epiphany or a pillar
[12:08] of fire appeared to them or a dream came
[12:10] to them. Doctrines are formed because of
[12:13] men's traditions.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:16] and you by your traditions make the word
[12:18] of none effect. That's in verse six. In
[12:21] verse 8, it says this this leads this
[12:24] this doctrines and these tradition leads
[12:26] to worshiping God by works. You see that
[12:31] and humanism but without the spirit of
[12:33] truth. This people draw nigh unto me
[12:35] with their mouth and honor me with their
[12:38] lips. That means it it comes out as lip
[12:40] service
[12:42] &gt;&gt; uh works
[12:44] &gt;&gt; and they get satisfied serving me that
[12:46] this this way but their heart is far
[12:49] from me which means they actually don't
[12:51] even have the spirit or the love of it
[12:55] within them.
[12:57] &gt;&gt; This is Christ telling us this in the
[12:58] first comment right verse 9 says their
[13:01] worship is vanity they actually
[13:04] worshiping me in vain. Two things can
[13:07] you can take from there. Vain means it's
[13:09] not even reaching me. The worship is not
[13:12] even worth the while.
[13:15] I'm not even responding to it.
[13:18] And also vanity means they're doing it
[13:21] for their own convenience.
[13:24] Their worship is convenient to them.
[13:30] What does that mean? That'll tell you
[13:32] that almost every doctrine or camp that
[13:35] is formed is formed to make the faith
[13:38] convenient to the people
[13:41] to a certain group of people. This is
[13:44] why it starts from cultures traditions.
[13:48] Right?
[13:49] This is so I could do this and I was
[13:52] amazed that brother brother Claude was
[13:55] actually praying about this this
[13:57] morning.
[13:59] uh even your race
[14:02] finds certain things convenient to you.
[14:06] Your race, your culture, your tribe,
[14:08] where you come from, all of those
[14:09] things. Here in Africa, you can see it
[14:11] in America, you can see it in China, you
[14:14] can see anywhere you want to. But you'll
[14:16] naturally flock to what your culture
[14:20] subscribes to.
[14:23] Even if there's no truth there, just
[14:25] because it's your culture, you'll get
[14:26] stuck in it.
[14:28] because it's convenient.
[14:32] And verse 13 tells us, you know, the
[14:35] well the disciples, you can see verse 12
[14:37] said they came to Christ and said, "Do
[14:39] you not know that the Pharisees were
[14:41] offended with what you said?"
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Well, of course he knew. He said it so
[14:45] he could offend them.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[14:48] &gt;&gt; And and not offend as in, "Oh, my
[14:50] feelings are hurt." Offend as in put a
[14:52] stumbling block in their way to make
[14:53] them think. Yes, sir.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; In the Bible, offend doesn't mean to
[14:56] hurt one's feelings.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; It means to stumble you up,
[15:01] &gt;&gt; right? Offense, a rock of offense is a
[15:04] stumbling stone.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; All right? So, don't read it from 2025's
[15:08] interpretation. And then verse 13, he
[15:11] says, he's basically telling them not to
[15:13] worry. These doctrines that come up,
[15:15] they were not planted by God. And if
[15:17] they're not planted by God, they're
[15:18] going to be rooted up anyway. So, don't
[15:21] worry about that. And and this is the
[15:23] important thing. verse 14. If you
[15:26] interpret that correctly, he's telling
[15:27] you don't fight them.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; Don't try to prove your point.
[15:33] &gt;&gt; Just let it continue. Do not feel like
[15:35] you have to go around correcting one
[15:37] another,
[15:38] &gt;&gt; correcting doctrines. Don't do that.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; He says they're basically blind leading
[15:44] the blind and all fall.
[15:46] That's where it heads up. All right. So
[15:49] this is a very good foundation to have
[15:52] when you approach doctrines. Are you
[15:56] with us?
[15:57] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's go to the question
[16:00] and read the question. This is a pretty
[16:01] long question sent to me by a believer.
[16:05] And um so I just want to say to you um
[16:08] some people may ask me, you know,
[16:09] brother Alistister, why are you doing
[16:10] question and answer? What do you think
[16:12] you are? Do you think you're Nobody said
[16:14] this. I'm just right. Do you think
[16:17] you're someone who can answer all the
[16:18] questions for the bride? Uh, no. But I
[16:21] ask I get asked questions and I've got
[16:24] to answer them, right? If somebody asks
[16:26] you a question, you have to answer. Um,
[16:29] the other thing is I just want to let
[16:30] you know for those of you who ask
[16:32] questions,
[16:34] uh, when I get a question, there are
[16:36] personal things. I go through the
[16:38] question and I look for things that
[16:40] might identify who you are. If you ask
[16:42] me a question, I remove that. So, but
[16:45] what I stick to is where the question is
[16:47] on the word and I kind of remove if you
[16:49] write a name there. I I I pull out names
[16:52] or something like that. I do my best to
[16:54] sift through it. So, if you're even
[16:56] speaking about a place where you come
[16:58] from or a church that you're at or
[17:00] whatever, I I extract it because we're
[17:02] not interested in that. We're interested
[17:04] in the word part of it.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:05] &gt;&gt; All right. So, uh always remember if you
[17:09] send me a question, I'm never going to
[17:10] put your name up on the screen or
[17:12] something. And the other thing I do is I
[17:14] let the person know that I will be doing
[17:16] the question. So you're not going to get
[17:18] surprised and say, "Oh, Ash, put my
[17:21] question up. I didn't want this to go
[17:23] public." I will always ask you first
[17:25] whether I can do this question publicly.
[17:28] All right. So here's the question. The
[17:31] deeper I delve into the message digging
[17:33] and mining for gold, I love that
[17:37] &gt;&gt; because that shows me you're searching,
[17:39] right? the more I come across various
[17:41] message doctrines or message movements I
[17:44] don't know what to do with them when I
[17:47] bring up certain quotes in other words
[17:49] the person is saying they're looking for
[17:52] they're are happy in the message they're
[17:54] excited they're discussing things with
[17:56] people and then this idea of doctrine
[17:59] starts come up and when I bring up
[18:01] certain quotes of brother Bham some of
[18:02] the brotherhood suspects and thinks that
[18:05] I am from the thunders movement or the
[18:07] perua movement etc so clearly Clearly,
[18:09] this person has experienced this. This
[18:12] brother has experienced this. He's
[18:14] sharing what he knows with people and
[18:16] they're asking him, "Are you from the
[18:18] Thunderous movement? Are you from the
[18:20] Peruia movement?" And the brother has no
[18:22] idea. I know it. He's got no idea. He's
[18:26] never heard. He's never been through
[18:27] like some of you. He doesn't know the
[18:29] history.
[18:30] &gt;&gt; He doesn't even know how he got here. He
[18:32] doesn't even know what Perua is.
[18:35] I started so he says I started doing
[18:38] some research on these things because I
[18:40] heard about the thunders but no one has
[18:43] explained to me what this doctrine was
[18:45] all about. In other words, he heard
[18:47] about the thunders movement.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; He knows what the thunders are
[18:53] but he doesn't know what the thunders
[18:55] movement from the history is. And now
[18:58] when he talks about it they're asking
[18:59] him if he's from there.
[19:02] Moreover, when I started asking the
[19:05] brotherhood about what the thunder's
[19:06] movement and perua movement meant or
[19:09] what the millennials movement meant,
[19:12] some of you have not heard that one. No
[19:15] one is able to explain it to me or the
[19:17] explanations were contradictory.
[19:20] Generally, there's a palpable fear and
[19:22] suspicion surrounding these kind of
[19:24] questions.
[19:26] I've noticed that there are varying
[19:28] beliefs in the message regarding the
[19:30] millennium. Recently a brother said he
[19:32] was already spiritually in his
[19:34] millennium which caused a stir many
[19:37] questions and some ridicule. This was
[19:40] the first time I heard of the term
[19:42] millennials. When I started to
[19:44] investigate I also saw the perushia
[19:47] movement and seven thunders movement and
[19:49] the brideging movement. As I mentioned
[19:52] earlier when I started asking I noticed
[19:55] that although people talk about these
[19:57] factions they re don't really know what
[20:00] they are and what their doctrine is.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; So from that you can gather that some
[20:06] people are saying it's wrong without
[20:08] even knowing what it is.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; Why would they say that? Cuz they've
[20:11] been told it.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; They've been told don't trust the
[20:14] thunders. Don't trust the perua. Don't
[20:16] trust the bride. What is it? Bride
[20:18] coming movement. don't trust it because
[20:21] it's wrong, it's false. So that's all
[20:23] people just like people walk around and
[20:25] say, you know, that place Durban uh by
[20:30] the beachfront, don't go near there.
[20:32] There's a monster in the ocean.
[20:35] So they'll go for years believing
[20:36] there's a monster in the ocean. Don't go
[20:38] nearby. That's exactly what it is,
[20:40] right? Don't trust it. It's false. It's
[20:43] a false doctrine. Don't believe it.
[20:44] Don't talk to anybody. That's what's
[20:46] been happening.
[20:48] And um I also heard that brother there
[20:52] was a name there. I pulled the name out.
[20:54] Press play and obey group. And the
[20:57] second set of seals while reading the
[21:00] study on Bugua by another name. Brother
[21:04] I see a lot of confusion and I don't
[21:06] want to be a part of it. So I'm asking
[21:08] about these things because I think it's
[21:10] important to know what you believe in
[21:13] and why.
[21:15] So the question is trying to tell us
[21:19] when I read through and and and try to
[21:22] discern what's in there. It's like okay
[21:24] here's what these people say about these
[21:27] movements.
[21:28] So who are we now? In other words
[21:31] there's an identification of of all
[21:34] those who are false. What is our
[21:36] identification?
[21:39] Okay very important question. So my
[21:42] question brother he says what are these
[21:45] movements he lists them millennials
[21:49] to us millennials are something else
[21:51] right millennials perua thunders press
[21:55] play and obey brides come
[21:59] [Music]
[22:01] right right some of you are so
[22:04] exasperated you can you it's like you
[22:07] can't believe that that this question
[22:10] can be asked in this Hey,
[22:12] &gt;&gt; some of you sitting here do not even
[22:14] realize I'm looking at your children's
[22:16] faces and they want to know
[22:19] &gt;&gt; because they're also like what is this?
[22:22] We don't know what's going on or either
[22:24] you haven't talked to them about it or
[22:26] you feel it's not even safe to even
[22:28] bring it up. But be sure when your kids
[22:32] become adults, they are going to hear
[22:34] this
[22:35] &gt;&gt; and then they're going to come and ask
[22:36] you and and and hopefully your brain is
[22:38] still intact by then to have memory that
[22:41] you can tell them. Right?
[22:43] &gt;&gt; So I'm not going to wait that long. I'm
[22:44] doing it for them now.
[22:49] So the next part of the question is what
[22:52] are their characteristics? In other
[22:54] words, I the brother is giving me
[22:56] guidance now on how to answer this,
[22:59] right? What are their characteristics?
[23:01] What do they believe? How does it relate
[23:03] to the truth we know and hope? Many of
[23:06] these movements base their beliefs on
[23:08] quotes from brother Baron and the
[23:10] message of the hour. I see definitely
[23:12] this brother has encountered them
[23:14] because when you meet with someone who
[23:16] comes from a doctrine, they just show
[23:18] you the quotes they've been given. It's
[23:19] pretty much like Jehovah's Witness. pull
[23:21] out track after track, quote after
[23:23] quote. This is and you can even ask
[23:25] them, "Brother, have you read the whole
[23:27] book?" Well, no, the quote, they've been
[23:30] pointed to quotes, but they haven't read
[23:31] the whole book. This is how
[23:33] indoctrination occurs.
[23:36] I'm beginning to see that these are
[23:38] interpretations of what brother Baram
[23:40] said and that they are human inventions.
[23:44] It's good to know what we believe and
[23:45] where we stand and how it relates to all
[23:47] these movements. Brother, I know you're
[23:50] very busy and don't have much time, but
[23:52] I think this is an important topic and
[23:54] can help many brothers and sisters
[23:56] understand what they believe and why.
[23:58] Obviously, I believe that to strengthen
[24:01] our faith and prepare us in case we
[24:03] encounter someone from the above
[24:05] movements and recognize who we're
[24:07] dealing with. So, this is important.
[24:09] Like, if I give you all the information,
[24:11] what are you going to do? Are you really
[24:13] going to use this to argue with them?
[24:17] Like if you encounter someone, what's
[24:19] the right approach?
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to do? What are we
[24:22] required of God? Are we supposed to
[24:24] stand toe-to-toe, fight with them, prove
[24:26] them wrong, put them in their place?
[24:27] What is the right uh uh thing to do?
[24:31] Right? And uh then we we can have a
[24:34] fruitful discussion, retrain and train
[24:37] our faith in love and lead to an
[24:38] interesting discussion that will yield
[24:40] many positive results. I like that.
[24:43] Exercise your faith. I like that. This
[24:46] may also sound a bit chaotic, but lately
[24:48] I've been thinking about it. I've
[24:50] noticed a lot of new things. There seems
[24:52] to be some taboo topics in the message
[24:55] of this hour that no one wants to touch.
[24:58] And this is probably due to fear uh due
[25:00] to our ignorance. That's very nicely
[25:04] put. Almost everything is out of fear.
[25:08] That's why they don't want to touch it.
[25:10] Okay. So, thank you brother. So before I
[25:13] embark on telling you the story of the
[25:15] message, I want to take the type of what
[25:18] happened in the first coming. And so let
[25:20] us look at the religious factions of
[25:23] Jews that were present at the first
[25:24] coming of Christ. Now this is a lot of
[25:26] you read your Bibles and and you haven't
[25:28] read the histories and you don't know
[25:30] what was happening at the time when
[25:32] Jesus arrived.
[25:34] Did you think all the church when when
[25:36] Jesus arrived was united?
[25:39] Do you think each suburb in Jerusalem or
[25:41] Nazareth or Bethlehem or around Israel,
[25:44] they were all united? Did you think all
[25:46] the Jews at that time enjoyed church? Do
[25:50] you think uh um um the the churches were
[25:54] were all so put together that they all
[25:57] agreed and they all were so happy? I
[26:00] mean, they literally have one law of
[26:01] Moses. They have one God. You know what
[26:03] what's the big deal,
[26:06] right? So I want to show you at the
[26:09] first coming of Christ the religious
[26:11] factions of Jews in the first coming. So
[26:13] here they are. Number one, the
[26:14] Pharisees. Number two, the Sadducees.
[26:17] Number three, the Essenes. Number four,
[26:20] the Zealots. Number five, the diaspora.
[26:24] I'm going to explain all these things to
[26:25] you. Number six, non-religious ruling
[26:28] class. And number seven, mixed working
[26:32] class. And you say, "But some of them
[26:34] sound like political." They're political
[26:37] and yet religious because every single
[26:40] group did not mix with the other and did
[26:44] not congregate together and spoke
[26:46] against the other,
[26:49] right? And these people, you're looking
[26:51] at at least seven different types were
[26:54] all present at the time of the Messiah,
[26:58] &gt;&gt; the first coming of Christ.
[27:01] And all the issues and questions and
[27:03] things that he had were from the
[27:06] different groups, right? And so also now
[27:09] we're talking about the actual Messiah
[27:12] coming. Each one of those groups had a
[27:15] different idea of how he was going to
[27:16] come,
[27:17] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Each one of those groups when they saw
[27:20] him interpreted him differently.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; How? Based on their background, their
[27:30] culture, their leaning.
[27:33] Now I'm saying to you, you know, you got
[27:36] people today who claim,
[27:39] well, we must not believe anything
[27:41] anyone says. As long as Jesus in his
[27:44] corporal body is is is not standing in
[27:47] front of me, I will not accept what
[27:49] anyone says. As long as I don't see the
[27:51] purifier or I don't see this or I don't
[27:54] listen we had the first coming the
[27:57] literal physical corporal body of the
[27:59] Messiah standing there
[28:02] and only 11 accepted it.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; He didn't even have a church bigger than
[28:09] ours.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; Say well he had 70 people. He had 70 and
[28:13] then they left him once he started
[28:14] preaching his third bull ministry.
[28:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then in the end there were
[28:18] only 120 in the upper room.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; So I always try to bring people back to
[28:25] this reality because people think we're
[28:27] going to have a great sweeping revival
[28:30] through the earth and draw in thousands.
[28:32] What I'm saying to you is look at the
[28:34] reality.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; You've got Jesus Christ himself.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; God made flesh. The word come down and
[28:41] made flesh among us. And every last one
[28:44] of them rejected him.
[28:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:48] So don't tell me that unless you see
[28:51] such and such a thing. What I'm saying
[28:53] to you is even if you had Jesus Christ
[28:55] himself standing here in the flesh
[28:56] today, you are going to interpret him
[28:58] based on what you know
[29:01] &gt;&gt; where you come from, what scriptures,
[29:04] some of you, I'll tell you, you'll even
[29:06] question Jesus Christ based on quotes
[29:08] from the message.
[29:12] Some of you will prove him wrong
[29:15] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham didn't say so.
[29:19] And and most likely you you're quoting
[29:21] something from brother Brandham to Jesus
[29:24] Christ based on what your pastor told
[29:26] you.
[29:30] How do I know? Well, it was done there
[29:33] in the first coming. So to me, it's
[29:36] amazing that we've got people in this
[29:38] message today with the confidence
[29:41] thinking that when Jesus comes in the
[29:44] flesh, they'll know him and they'll
[29:45] accept him.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; When that failed in the first coming
[29:52] and you know, I try to be as real as I
[29:54] can. And I I when I talk to the young
[29:56] people, I say to them, if Jesus came in
[29:58] his literal body flying around in the
[30:01] clouds, the first people will know is
[30:03] CNN and BBC. There'll be helicopters and
[30:06] cameras. It'll be news networks all over
[30:08] the world videoing him. And the news
[30:13] would be
[30:14] it's a hologram.
[30:17] It's not real. Somebody's doing
[30:20] something. And most messaged people run
[30:24] towards conspiracies.
[30:26] Oh, some this is Russia. This is China.
[30:29] This is somebody producing something in
[30:30] the sky. This is what's amazing to me.
[30:32] Message believers think they'll see
[30:34] Jesus and all believe straight away. No,
[30:38] you'll all believe CNN first.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Or BBC. And then what's he going to do?
[30:44] Because now you have to go to the quote
[30:45] where he'll never put his foot on earth.
[30:46] Of course, he's lying.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; So he's not putting his foot on earth.
[30:51] So now, how are you going to question
[30:52] him when he's flying?
[30:55] &gt;&gt; I know what you're going to say. Well,
[30:57] the power will rise up within us and
[30:59] we'll fly to meet him.
[31:03] Listen, the way humans work is you'll
[31:06] disbelieve first.
[31:09] You'll actually believe CNN and BBC and
[31:11] all the news networks and the social
[31:13] media. You'll believe it's a prank. And
[31:16] if you see it, how how the world is
[31:19] doing things right now, you'll never
[31:20] believe it's true.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; You'll rather believe aliens exist.
[31:30] All right,
[31:31] with that, let's go to it. I want to
[31:34] look at the Pharisees first. Okay,
[31:38] so
[31:40] the Pharisees, I'm going to tell you
[31:42] what they believed, right? They were
[31:45] strict adherence to the entirety of the
[31:48] Old Testament. That means these
[31:50] Pharisees were legalists
[31:53] who said the Old Testament is our law.
[31:56] We stick with that. This is why they
[31:58] brought scripture to Jesus to question
[32:00] him. They were taking him back to the
[32:03] word.
[32:06] They imagine the Messiah standing in
[32:08] front of them, but they need scriptures
[32:11] to question the Messiah. Think of the
[32:13] reality of that
[32:15] and think of whether you think you're
[32:17] confident enough to find the truth with
[32:20] your knowledge on the message
[32:22] that should the truth present itself,
[32:24] you'll just openheartedly accept it and
[32:27] not question it.
[32:29] Okay? The Pharisees concerned themselves
[32:32] with making a clear distinction between
[32:35] Jews and Gentiles. In other words, the
[32:37] Pharisees did not believe Gentiles were
[32:39] going to be saved. Jews must be here.
[32:41] Gentiles must be there. We are the elite
[32:43] people. These are lost. Very much like a
[32:46] camp, right? They use the law of Moses
[32:49] to subject people to laws that could
[32:52] clearly indicate a public social
[32:55] difference between Jews and Gentiles. In
[32:57] other words, they used the word of Moses
[33:00] to separate themselves.
[33:03] They did it in their dressing, in their
[33:06] mannerisms, in the place where they
[33:08] gathered. Does it sound familiar?
[33:12] And these people with their uh um
[33:16] dedication to the Old Testament, they
[33:19] also developed beliefs in angels, angel
[33:22] hierarchies, things not mentioned in the
[33:24] Bible, things that they got from
[33:26] Babylon, Greece, Rome, Meo, Persia. They
[33:32] were believing in all those things.
[33:35] uh they developed stories and doctrines
[33:38] about the afterlife and about the
[33:40] resurrection of the dead and they were
[33:42] they were basically influenced by the
[33:44] philosophies of the past Jewish teachers
[33:48] who they felt received the spirit of
[33:51] interpretation of what Moses wrote.
[33:55] Sounds familiar,
[33:57] right? Then there's this group called
[33:59] the Sadducees.
[34:02] And no, it doesn't mean they were sad.
[34:04] You see?
[34:06] I remember this from when I was a kid. I
[34:08] remember these message preachers playing
[34:10] with the words. No, Sadducees were a
[34:14] very influential
[34:16] group among the Jewish priesthood during
[34:19] the time of Jesus and they were noted
[34:21] for opposing the Pharisees. So,
[34:24] Sadducees opposed the Pharisees. What
[34:26] was the difference?
[34:28] Money.
[34:30] The Sadducees were very wealthy.
[34:33] They were the wealthy part a wealthy
[34:36] part of Jerusalem society and they said
[34:40] well we follow only the Torah only the
[34:42] first five books of the Bible of course
[34:44] you you Pharisees believe the Tanakh and
[34:47] you know the the the oral word and all
[34:50] of that you believe all these things we
[34:52] stick with only Moses we're like super
[34:55] legalists
[34:57] right
[34:58] and the Sadducees rejected any teaching
[35:01] of resurrection because Moses Moses does
[35:03] not talk of a resurrection. Um, so in
[35:06] other words, these these Sadducees cut
[35:08] out the book of Job,
[35:10] Samuel, Kings,
[35:13] all of that. They refuse to read any.
[35:15] They want to stick with only the first
[35:16] five books of the Bible. Do you think
[35:18] there's no people like that in the
[35:20] message?
[35:24] Right? They But the Sadducees rejected
[35:27] resurrection, angels, and spiritualism.
[35:30] any spiritualism. Don't come to us with
[35:33] any other prophet. Don't come to us with
[35:35] your baptism of the Holy Ghost. Don't
[35:37] come to us with your anointing. There's
[35:39] only one. There's Moses and nothing
[35:41] else. This is so good for wealthy people
[35:44] because wealthy people do not want to
[35:46] part with their money. Okay.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; And if some guy who's green or wet
[35:53] behind the ears, born yesterday,
[35:55] whatever phrases you want to say,
[35:56] pitches up and he's got some anointing
[35:58] and he comes and preaches fire and
[36:00] brimstone and then he's expecting you to
[36:04] to fund him. They don't want to do that.
[36:07] It's so easy to say, "Let's just stick
[36:09] with the first five books of the Bible."
[36:11] Obviously, that cancels out any other
[36:13] claim or ministry. So you can imagine
[36:16] you've got Jesus Christ coming from
[36:18] Bethlehem
[36:20] uh speaking to them the Sadducees who
[36:23] were these high and mighty silk robot
[36:25] people who were there to serve the
[36:27] wealthy and speaking to this riff raff
[36:32] who was supposedly anointed what they
[36:35] couldn't deal with he had actual
[36:36] healings and miracles and discernment of
[36:39] their heart something was pricking their
[36:41] hearts to keep following him to answer
[36:44] Truthfully, if they only cared about the
[36:46] wealthy and the and the first five
[36:48] books, why did he follow him around to
[36:50] ask him questions?
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Because he was even affecting the
[36:54] wealthy.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; His word was pulling the wealthy away
[36:59] from the Sadducees movement and the
[37:01] Pharisees movement. So, they were
[37:04] scared.
[37:05] These people also, the Sadducees were
[37:08] very legalistic about the temple. No, it
[37:11] must be this way. Must be the way Moses
[37:13] said that must be gold. That must be
[37:14] brass. That must be silver. This
[37:16] shouldn't be placed here. This
[37:17] shouldn't. Does that sound familiar?
[37:20] Those people who use cood like a rule
[37:22] book
[37:24] or brother Baron said this. You can't
[37:25] stray from that. You You're saying what
[37:27] brother Baron didn't say. Yes, we've had
[37:30] Sadducees too.
[37:32] We also know they serve the wealthy.
[37:36] All right. Then you get this group, the
[37:38] Essenes. They were very small group.
[37:41] There were about history tells us they
[37:42] were about 4,000 only.
[37:45] And these Essenes believed that all
[37:48] other Jews were apostate.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; All others, Pharisees, Sadducees, all
[37:53] other Jews were basically lost apostate.
[37:55] They were just serving lies, right? And
[37:57] the Essenes separated themselves into
[38:00] smaller communities.
[38:02] And these were apocalyptic, meaning they
[38:05] believed the end of the world was at
[38:06] hand. Everything was going to be
[38:08] destroyed. everyone else was going to be
[38:10] toast and we were all going to be saved.
[38:12] Sounds familiar.
[38:17] They believed in preparing for the end
[38:19] of the world, purification, live a holy
[38:22] lifestyle, live by abstinence, stay away
[38:24] from this, stay away from that. They
[38:26] believed in ritual cleansing by water
[38:28] baptism. In fact, uh I think history
[38:30] kind of thinks that the Christian church
[38:33] got water baptism from the Essenes,
[38:36] right? And u the believed you should not
[38:39] make vows. You should not sacrifice to
[38:41] animals. You should not own slaves. None
[38:44] of those. They just believe live a
[38:46] purified life, eat proper foods, drink
[38:49] clean water, don't wear this certain
[38:51] clothes, stay away from all evil. So in
[38:53] other words, they were a cult.
[38:56] They lived in camps. They literally
[38:58] lived in camps away from other unclean
[39:01] people.
[39:04] All right. Then there was this group
[39:05] called the zealots.
[39:08] In other words, zeal, right? Now the
[39:11] zealots, they were very small, very
[39:14] passionate, very political,
[39:17] influential Jewish faction.
[39:20] Uh how many of you know that Jesus had
[39:22] one of them among him?
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Right. He was called Simon Zellet
[39:28] or Zilotes depending on how you
[39:30] pronounce it in Greek. But Simon the
[39:32] Zealot was one of the Lord Jesus'
[39:35] disciples, right? And um they believe
[39:37] that it seems like the Zealots were were
[39:40] could have been part of the problem
[39:43] bringing Christ to the Romans because
[39:46] they were causing they were always
[39:47] causing political unrest everywhere
[39:50] and uh it's believed that they might
[39:52] have caused the destruction of the
[39:54] temple in AD70 that that brought it
[39:56] about right they operated underground
[40:00] clandiston operations suspected of
[40:02] inciting a number of revolts against
[40:05] Rome
[40:06] I mean these people were so inspired by
[40:08] the word they wanted to bring they
[40:11] believed they could bring down the
[40:13] entire Roman Empire. Small group of
[40:14] people.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Incredible. Right.
[40:18] Okay. This is some the the the fourth
[40:21] one is something you might be more
[40:23] familiar with because this word is still
[40:24] used today. It's the diaspora. The
[40:27] diaspora speaks of the Jewish people
[40:29] that live outside of Judea, outside of
[40:31] Israel. The diaspora are people, Jewish
[40:34] people who live all over the world. In
[40:36] other words, there were Jews living in
[40:38] Greece when when Christ came. There were
[40:41] Jews living in Babylonia when Christ
[40:43] came. There were Jews living in Arabia,
[40:46] in Northern Africa, in India,
[40:50] all over the place. There were there
[40:52] were Jews, the the chosen people living
[40:55] elsewhere when Jesus Christ came.
[40:58] And the word was passed to all of them.
[41:01] They were called the diaspora. And the
[41:03] diaspora um they did not return to
[41:06] Israel. They were also called the
[41:08] helanized Jews as in helanized as in
[41:11] from Greece and other places. They were
[41:14] now these Jews not living in Israel.
[41:17] They were diverse. They were liberal.
[41:20] They dressed like the place they came
[41:22] from. Right? If they were Grecian Jews,
[41:25] they dressed like the Greeks. They
[41:27] believed in this
[41:29] Grecian houses and Grecian uh uh uh
[41:33] foods and all. So these are children of
[41:36] Israel living in other countries.
[41:40] Sound familiar?
[41:42] They were educated by the west.
[41:46] Uh they had western thinking. They were
[41:48] very rich as compared with Jews from
[41:50] Israel. And they were literally ignorant
[41:54] of what was going on with Christ. All
[41:56] they knew was it was passed to them.
[41:58] There was this there was rumors of this
[42:00] Messiah. But if you're living in Greece
[42:03] or you're living on some coast in
[42:05] Portugal, it's so beautiful and you're
[42:07] hearing about this rumor of unrest in
[42:10] Israel. How much do you care?
[42:12] Not much, right? Okay. Then you had this
[42:16] non-religious ruling class right there
[42:18] in Israel. And this is the royal family
[42:21] of Herod.
[42:23] uh noblemen, politicians, the ruling
[42:26] class that were bought off by the Romans
[42:31] and who the Pharisees, Sadducees and all
[42:33] of them were forced to come to for
[42:35] political laws. Looks like we are being
[42:38] surrounded by monkeys.
[42:41] I don't mean these people. I mean
[42:44] literally there are monkeys around the
[42:45] church now.
[42:47] Uh so this ruling class were bought off
[42:51] by the um uh uh government of Rome. They
[42:55] were literally being paid by Pontius
[42:57] Pilate. They were and this is why when
[42:59] Christ was brought to Herod, he sent him
[43:01] to Pontious Pilot or Pilot sent him
[43:02] there, Herod sent him back. It was like
[43:05] I don't want to I you know I don't want
[43:07] to have this on my conscience. I'm
[43:09] sorry. It's like, you know, let the
[43:10] people deal with them themselves or or
[43:12] do this the Roman way or something, but
[43:14] I don't want my hands messed in this
[43:17] situation. So, this non-religious ruling
[43:20] class, remember, to be the non-religious
[43:23] ruling class and to control your
[43:27] religious people, you also have to give
[43:29] gifts to God. You're going to you're
[43:32] going to do things to show the people
[43:35] that you are religious. You're going to
[43:37] have to make a show one day when there's
[43:39] no rain. You're going to pray for rain.
[43:41] When there's no uh crops, you're going
[43:43] to pray for crops. When there's
[43:44] something, you're going to make a show
[43:46] of something. Which means every once in
[43:47] a while, these these politicians would
[43:50] step down from their uh uh places and
[43:54] come and do some religious ritual just
[43:56] to appease the public.
[44:00] You know that, right? So these are
[44:03] political wealthy and non-religious uh
[44:07] working class they would be publicans
[44:09] you know when the Bible speaks of
[44:10] publicans publicans are is actually a
[44:12] word for tax collectors so they are Jews
[44:15] who collected taxes on behalf of Herod
[44:17] and behalf of uh Rome and the people
[44:21] hated publicans and here's the thing you
[44:25] know one of Jesus's uh disciples was a
[44:27] publican Matthew and then Jesus also met
[44:31] with Zak
[44:32] a tax collector and then he was being
[44:35] criticized by the Pharisees and
[44:37] Sadducees for sitting with the publicans
[44:40] and even the poor people watching Christ
[44:43] interact with the publicans. What is
[44:45] wrong with you?
[44:47] &gt;&gt; How can you meet with these horrible
[44:49] people who take our money and give it to
[44:51] Rome?
[44:53] What is this showing you? The world
[44:55] doesn't care who it's coming to.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; You're fighting with each other based on
[44:59] convenience. He doesn't care who he's
[45:01] coming to.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; And of course the the the the guys
[45:07] everyone hates the public sector
[45:09] governmentrun places. These are all
[45:11] non-religious uh ruling class. Okay.
[45:14] Then you got the mixed working class.
[45:17] The mixed working class is basically the
[45:19] poor, the merchants, the traders. You
[45:22] know, they're unable to keep perfect
[45:24] religion.
[45:25] Look, look at you nice people sitting
[45:27] there. You know, you're dressed nice,
[45:32] you're you can read, you're educated.
[45:34] Hopefully, most of you have been through
[45:36] school and got your matrix. Some of you
[45:38] may not have, but you can read the
[45:40] Bible. You can read the message. Uh some
[45:42] of you sitting here in message churches
[45:44] and online, you uh have this mental
[45:47] prowess to read a quote and to argue
[45:50] with me about it
[45:52] and to tell me you could be right.
[45:56] And yet there are people out there who
[45:58] cannot read.
[46:02] So you think you know doctrine and the
[46:05] seals and the thunders what? Just
[46:07] because you're educated.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; What about all these people who can't
[46:12] read the message?
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; So they're never going to stand up to
[46:17] your holiness. What? Just because they
[46:19] can't read?
[46:23] &gt;&gt; So they're they're in the streets. They
[46:25] can't read. They can't write. They
[46:27] they'll if they try and read a message,
[46:28] they fall asleep in 5 minutes. So, are
[46:31] you measuring holiness in your message
[46:34] churches across the world simply because
[46:37] you can read better than someone else?
[46:40] &gt;&gt; You can understand better than someone
[46:42] else.
[46:45] There are literally people in this world
[46:47] who cannot read and write, who will not
[46:49] be able to keep your perfect religion.
[46:52] They always need assistance from the
[46:55] religious and the wealthy. They're there
[46:58] are widows. There are orphans. They
[46:59] always need help from the church. They
[47:02] are uneducated. They have mixed belief.
[47:04] Now, when you are uneducated, you are
[47:06] you don't reason much, which means you
[47:08] are more likely going to follow someone
[47:10] who has got signs, wonders, miracles.
[47:13] That's the trap. This is why the poor in
[47:16] the hedges and highways flocked to
[47:18] Christ because he didn't have a
[47:20] complicated doctrine but he had signs.
[47:24] And this doesn't make these people great
[47:26] because when it came time for them to
[47:29] hear the word, they crossed the sea. All
[47:31] they wanted was food. They were not
[47:33] really interested in what he was
[47:34] teaching and then he slammed them for
[47:36] that.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; You see? So it doesn't mean if you're
[47:41] poor or you're educated that you're any
[47:43] better or any holy. These are all the
[47:46] people available to Christ at his first
[47:48] coming.
[47:54] I'm just amazed
[47:57] by message people, you know, they were
[48:01] taken from
[48:03] poor neighborhoods,
[48:05] poorest suburbs in wherever you Durban,
[48:08] Johannesburg, Cape Town, wherever you're
[48:10] from. And then after 20 years, you're
[48:13] suddenly a professor of the message.
[48:16] And then you're
[48:18] because you can keep the message because
[48:20] you read COD and you got this great
[48:23] understanding of how dressing must be or
[48:25] this great understanding of how the
[48:27] church order must be. Now suddenly you
[48:30] and your family because you are able to
[48:32] read, your kids are able to read, you
[48:34] now got this holiness down perfect where
[48:37] there are other people who cannot read
[48:39] the quotes like you are and you look at
[48:41] them and you look at them as unholy.
[48:43] Why? just cuz you can read and then the
[48:46] people who can't read are looking at you
[48:48] thinking you hypocrites
[48:50] you can read you know all the stuff and
[48:53] we know you don't really keep it.
[48:57] So mixed workingclass people some were
[49:00] religious in their own way and righteous
[49:03] with whatever that means. Okay with with
[49:06] with whatever they had they were
[49:08] righteous. Like if they had little in
[49:10] their homes, if they had a a a a mud hut
[49:14] with uh one room and you know straw for
[49:18] a bed or something with whatever they
[49:20] had, they tried to be righteous.
[49:24] Are you with me?
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Now here's the thing. Paul was a
[49:30] Pharisee.
[49:31] The first apostle to the Gentiles was a
[49:34] Pharisee.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; That means he was educated. He was
[49:39] religious. He come from a background of
[49:41] believing in angels and hierarchies,
[49:43] resurrection of the dead.
[49:46] Uh uh believing in both the Torah and
[49:49] the rest of the Tanakh uh and hearing
[49:52] all the oral truths and the written
[49:54] truths. And that's where he came from.
[49:58] When you look at Paul's writing, you can
[50:00] actually tell his background.
[50:03] One of the disciples of Christ was Simon
[50:05] the Zealot. We may not know what group
[50:08] Peter and Andrew came from, but they
[50:10] definitely look like mixed working class
[50:13] cuz they came from a group of poor
[50:15] fishermen.
[50:17] Matthew was a publican and a tax
[50:18] collector. Then there may have been
[50:21] others like the 70 who came from all the
[50:24] above groups,
[50:27] but they were attracted to Christ. They
[50:29] decided to follow him and and receive
[50:31] the spirit and go about healing and
[50:33] casting out devils. Every person had his
[50:37] own background and belief and they all
[50:40] disagreed with each other. They were
[50:43] only agreeing with him at the moment.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Do you realize why they're literally
[50:50] disciples surrounding Christ and
[50:51] dissenting among themselves?
[50:54] &gt;&gt; So many times they're busy arguing with
[50:57] can you imagine Christ telling them, you
[50:59] know, the I must be lifted up and and
[51:01] you destroy this temple in 3 days. I'll
[51:03] raise it up again. and he spoke about
[51:04] the temp the the the that concerning his
[51:07] body, the temple of his body. And the
[51:09] Pharisees in the group would be saying,
[51:11] "Yeah, that's perfect." And the
[51:12] Sadducees in the group said, "No, no,
[51:14] no. There must be something wrong." And
[51:15] they're busy arguing and Christ discerns
[51:18] their heart. Or maybe there's a
[51:19] zealatus. Why are we even talking about
[51:21] this stuff? Let's go take Rome,
[51:24] you know. And the other quiet ones are
[51:26] like, "No, no, just let him speak." You
[51:28] know, he's got these words that touch
[51:29] us. workingass people be like the
[51:31] fisherman said just shush man just let
[51:34] him speak we just want to hear more you
[51:36] guys have read all this we haven't even
[51:38] heard yet
[51:42] right
[51:44] they all had their own idea about the
[51:46] Messiah and how he should come every
[51:48] last one of them had their own ideas
[51:51] people like the diaspora actually didn't
[51:53] even care
[51:55] they don't care about the Messiah coming
[51:57] literally enjoying their Grecian
[51:59] lifestyle
[52:00] They're like hoping the Messiah doesn't
[52:02] come now. You know, maybe he comes
[52:04] later. Let me enjoy my life and die.
[52:09] Sounds familiar. Know some of you young
[52:12] people. I hope the rapture doesn't take
[52:14] place. I want to be married first.
[52:19] I want to have babies.
[52:22] After you have babies, when's a rapture
[52:24] coming?
[52:26] Poor
[52:30] pathetic humans.
[52:33] So the only problem I see in the type is
[52:36] that when the Messiah actually came,
[52:40] none of their beliefs led them to the
[52:42] truth.
[52:46] Not one group said, "We are devoted to
[52:49] you." Not one. There were just people
[52:54] that came out of there. Can you see
[52:57] that? And here's the other the second
[53:00] point is Messiah did not validate or
[53:04] join any one of them.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; He brought them from all of them.
[53:11] See that? There's a quote brother says,
[53:13] "God doesn't even care about your
[53:16] doctrine. He gave you the Holy Ghost
[53:17] anyway."
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; You know that? Yeah. Yeah, that's in the
[53:22] message. So Christ when he came, he did
[53:25] not align himself with any particular
[53:27] doctrine of that time. However, what is
[53:29] noticeable is that those who followed
[53:32] him and his disciples uh uh would be
[53:36] people who came from from all of these
[53:39] factions. So even having the background
[53:41] they had, those who followed him were
[53:44] able to learn from their experience. So
[53:47] by Christ bringing all of them in like
[53:50] one from each group or whoever he
[53:53] started getting questions from their
[53:56] background and answering questions from
[53:58] each background and the others didn't
[54:00] realize they're learning from the others
[54:02] questions.
[54:06] I hope you can see where I'm going with
[54:07] this.
[54:08] So even having the background they had,
[54:11] those who followed him were able to
[54:13] learn from the experience in some way
[54:16] and they recognized the real coming of
[54:19] the Lord. They would try to go back. The
[54:21] Sadducee in the group would try to go
[54:22] back to the Sadducee and you got to
[54:25] come. No, sorry. We're not interested.
[54:27] Why? And the Pharisee would do the same.
[54:29] And the Zealots would do the same. No,
[54:31] sorry. We have our mission. We have our
[54:33] leader. We have this. We have that.
[54:35] We're not interested. Which means these
[54:37] people where they came from, they try to
[54:39] go back and get their believers to come
[54:42] and they were flat out refused,
[54:44] rejected, kicked out.
[54:48] Sounds familiar.
[54:50] Going to ask that a lot. When it comes
[54:53] to the message of the hour, there are a
[54:56] lot of negative things, right? So, now
[54:58] I'm going to get to the message.
