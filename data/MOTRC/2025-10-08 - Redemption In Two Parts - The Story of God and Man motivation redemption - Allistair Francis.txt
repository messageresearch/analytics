TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So redemption comes in two parts. Next slide, brothers. Part one is the first coming of Christ, the son of man to bring the Holy Ghost to the human vessel. Now, I could talk years on this. We're going to try and make this preede really sort of uh um um shorten it so that we can understand it quickly. Right? So because of what Adam lost, he now has that king theophony has to become man born through a woman and still be Adam, &gt;&gt; right? So man had to be redeemed and that is Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ. Brothers, you can put the next slide up. Brother Bram's the words on the side is brother Bram's words. So God became man that man might become God. That's a direct quote from the message. God became man so that man could become God. Why? Because man was God in the beginning. Lost his first estate. Came to this beastly nature. Has been living in this way for 4,000 years. And to bring him back full redemption, he becomes the Lord Jesus Christ. That's the purpose for Jesus Christ, right? So, the first step is we need redemption. We need a man like the first Adam to bring back something to get us to believe. Because for 4,000 years, we've been believing all sorts of trash. We made up cultures and religions and languages and and cave drawings and drawings of deities and all kinds of superstitions about stars and flowers and plants and animals. And we were worshiping the creation instead of the creator. And he now the creator himself has to come down and become us. This is what's amazing. So that logos that came out of the fountain of life becomes a man. Don't you love him saints? &gt;&gt; Born of the flesh but also through spoken word. He was spoken word in the womb of Mary that created that born through the woman. Right. King Theophony himself that we saw who was filled with all those attributes became flesh &gt;&gt; and walked among us being born of woman. He was Emmanuel God with us. &gt;&gt; He was Adonai. He was I am with us. He became flesh. He subjected himself to time from eternity. Paused everything. Came down into time and existed for a short while with us in time. King Theophony himself became flesh. It's not just one attribute that became Adam. This is all of those attributes. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he have in him? This is the this is the secret. Like Adam in the first time, in him were two sections of attributes, masculine and feminine. Amen. Let's read in the message Jehovah Gyra. So he created man out of the dust of the earth, not in his image. But when God came down in the form of man by Jesus Christ to redeem that the man that fell from the image of the earth, he was made in the image of the earth. He made himself a body. First he made himself in King Theophony in the in the form of man that was coming in the future. Now he makes himself in a fleshly body &gt;&gt; of earth. There is no limit to God's love for us. There is no limit to his there's no uh place he cannot reach. And and we know he he doesn't even stop there. After Calvary, he goes right down into hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His purpose was to take away man's guilt of sin and bring something new to man. Something new which never occurred before. the Holy Ghost in a new way to bring restoration. What has to happen is like Adam, right? Let's go to the next slide. There he's on Calvary. He died. Brother man said when they cut his side, it was symbolic of water, blood, and spirit which constitutes a birth. He said that's where the church was born. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's the church? the feminine attribute. The same way Adam was laid to rest and took out of his side the feminine attribute to produce the female of his connection of his being. He takes out the feminine attribute and the sewer goes forth to sew seeds. The Holy Ghost goes out to bring forth the feminist attribute over 2,000 years of church ages. The same fountain of seven colors. Those attributes from those seven colors is draw. Human beings are drawing from the divine nature. Add to your faith, virtue, virtue of knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness. Add to it the seven colors, the natures of man that were taken from him when he fell. He now sends us the dispensation of the Holy Ghost to bring forth spoken word. That is necessary. And how is he sending his spoken word? Seven stars in his right hand. seven angels. &gt;&gt; Angels were purposed to bring the word. He could see they were going to be necessary, right? And then we said when he when he does this, man is born again of the word and theophony body begins to grow in heaven. You are here on earth in a fallen form, right? But because you believe in the word that he sent because of Calvary, because of the Holy Ghost, because of the token, because the blood was broken, because the life was coming out and the word was coming out in spoken word form, you now receive that. You receive a new birth and theophony begins to grow in heaven. &gt;&gt; We read this last week. While the spiritual birth is growing in your heart of God, there is a physical or celestial body growing to receive your spirit. When the life leaves this body, it goes to that body. Glory to God. Which brings us to part two of the redemption process. The first part was the first coming. What is the second coming? Amen. So the second coming of the son of man to unite the word body and the human vessel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The human vessel had been living in sin. He brought the Holy Ghost to bring the human body, the the sinful vessel back to being filled with the feminist nature. building up the church. He gave himself for the church that he might present her to himself without blame, without blemish, without spot, without wrinkle. The first coming, he died so that the feminist attribute could be manifested on this earth again. But the second coming is to unite the masculine and feminine. Then bringing the unity that's bringing the completion of Genesis 5:1 that in the beginning he created them male and female created the ye them and called their name Adam. Redemption comes in two parts the first coming the second coming. Calvary and in this time he brings back the masculine attribute. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The masculine attribute of the logos returns to earth as king theophony and makes him. So his first coming brought the feminist attribute. The second coming brings the masculine which is why it is the coming of Christ and he does it through the son of man. He's now in this day vindicating the masculine word that would cap the feminine &gt;&gt; that has been manifest. The feminine has been manifest through the ages. She operated as the church. There was signs, wonders, there was healing. There was uh prophecies. There was discernment. There was the word being preached by the seven angels. There were all kinds of things related to the church. There was baptisms. There was communion. There was washing of feet. There was all kinds of ordinances. They were all feminist attributes. There was worship towards him. But yet you still were not connected with him. He sent you a witness, the Holy Ghost, to make those attributes, that feminine attribute become alive in you, waiting for the time that the masculine attribute should return in the message proving his word. Um, oh, before we get there, this is what this is. This is what 963 February 28th is. &gt;&gt; It is the masculine attribute returning. It is king Theophony the capstone the the scientist said made itself visible for 28 minutes which is about the space of half an hour which is the seventh seal the first fold of the seventh seal. He made himself visible for what? For a prophet on earth to know that is a vindication that the seventh seal is to be opened. &gt;&gt; What is the seventh seal all about? The seventh seal brings him back to earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't need him to come back to earth like 2,000 years ago cuz there's no need to bring the feminist attribute him in the form of flesh. He now is to come as king theophony to cap the fleshly body that is on earth. &gt;&gt; Proving his word. Do you see what I mean? It's son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh among us and will make his word so real it unite the church and him as one. So what the masculine attribute would come down and show himself united with a prophet on earth to reveal the word of himself. That's what son of man ministry is. And then she'll go home to the wedding supper. She's already united. We go to the wedding supper all self all the flesh of mighty men cause the marriage of the lamb has come but the rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here there it is unites with the person they two become one and then what does it do then it manifests the son of man again not the church theologians the son of man which means who is the bride the bride is going to be the full manifestation of the son of man &gt;&gt; the bride will be the revealing of the son of man. Brother Benam was only the first fruits of that. This would be today the full redemption of man coming back to the original purpose. This coming is before the translation. &gt;&gt; This coming is before what you call the rapture, the transfiguration, the change of bodies from this state that we were lost in to the state that has been restored to us. Which means the coming we ought to have been looking for is the word himself, not Jesus Christ from 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; See, because we believe he came and released the feminine attribute, and we're waiting to be united with the masculine. That's what we're looking for. &gt;&gt; The coming of this full word will do two things. It will reveal the gene seed in you, the nature of the person you are meant to be. And number two, it will unite the theophony with the human vessel. &gt;&gt; Because who does he come with in the seventh seal? Your theophonyies. &gt;&gt; He makes that dimension real to you. Have you heard from your theophony yet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This will bring on the rapture which is the process of taking you into translation. How does this happen? Why does this happen? What is the gene seed attribute? The father. What is theophony? The word. What is the human being? The vessel. And it all comes together. The Godhead living in the vessel. &gt;&gt; When the vessel by free will today believes the word and accepts it, the father, the word unite, making it God again. &gt;&gt; But the vessel is not the perfect vessel. You say, being conceived of sexual desire, it will dissolve. &gt;&gt; Yes. When this house of this tabernacle be dissolved, that means there's a promise that the vessel will become new for the millennium, not born of a woman, but spoken into existence by King Theophony again. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It doesn't have to fly off somewhere. It's dissolved. That means it remains in the state of theophony waiting for the millennium where the body then is spoken into existence and you receive glorified condition. Saints, here's a quote from the oneness of God. Now, don't you see the great picture? We in flesh are different. We're like a byproduct of a created being by holy wedlock, but in spirit, we are sons and daughters, not some other spirit, but the spirit of the living God. We are in his likeness, in unity, in the perfect image of the living God. Because we become sons and daughters, not separated by the same spirit, the same God, the same person, joined in wedlock to the eternal. See how God planed that we should not be, we should be not a different but him. &gt;&gt; Not some other being of some other tribe, but a real union, an offspring of the almighty done by a holy union. Now the body comes from mother and father, but the spirit come from God. God separating himself as Adam was separated. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; That's the word of the message. &gt;&gt; Nominal Christianity does not give you that. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no other ideology or thought on this earth that tells you you can be worthy to be the final manifestation of God and that you are not required to be some blind worshipper, some bow downer. &gt;&gt; You are supposed to be him in the character that he meant for you to be. &gt;&gt; So who is man? He was made to be the last unfolding of God. the last expressed attributes of the revelation of who God is. He is the vessel in which God can be properly known within time. &gt;&gt; Not angels, &gt;&gt; not lions, not elephants, not anything else. Man is the vessel through which God and all these attributes can be known. And each one of you is a different attribute.
