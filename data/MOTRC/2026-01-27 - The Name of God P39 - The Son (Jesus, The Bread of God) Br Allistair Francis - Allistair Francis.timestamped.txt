[0:02] The Lord bless you. While we're
[0:03] standing, let's read the word of God.
[0:05] And we're going to
[0:08] read from John chapter 6 verse 33. You
[0:12] just have you can just follow on your
[0:13] screen. And uh simple
[0:18] verse from the Bible, John 6:33.
[0:23] For the bread of God is he which cometh
[0:27] down from heaven and giveth life unto
[0:31] the world. The bread of God is he which
[0:34] cometh down from heaven and giveth life
[0:37] unto the world. The Lord add a blessing
[0:38] to his word. You may be seated. Amen. So
[0:42] this morning we're dealing with knowing
[0:44] God 2026. This is our series. We started
[0:47] I think it would have been 20 24 and or
[0:51] 23
[0:52] and we're on the name of God
[0:55] uh part 39 and this is the son. We've
[0:58] been through the disposition of the
[1:00] father. We come to the son and this is
[1:02] part 12 and for a title it's going to be
[1:05] Jesus the bread of god. Amen. So, uh,
[1:10] Sunday school, I want you to pay careful
[1:12] attention because, um, we're going to
[1:16] talk about all the different kinds of
[1:17] bread in the Bible. And, uh, so I want
[1:20] you to get to know which kinds of bread
[1:22] there are in the Bible,
[1:24] right? And, uh, we're going to talk
[1:27] about how it happens in the Lord Jesus
[1:29] Christ and also in our day. So, pay
[1:31] careful attention.
[1:34] All right? So, we're going to look at
[1:36] this name of God, the bread of God.
[1:40] Okay? Jesus, the bread of God, the bread
[1:43] of God that came down from heaven.
[1:46] So, why is bread a name,
[1:52] right? We've seen other name. the rock
[1:55] of offense, the strong tower in uh in
[1:58] the Hebrew uh Bible, the rock of offense
[2:03] has a Hebrew word. It's a name. The same
[2:06] as Yeshua, the same as Jehovah. Rock is
[2:10] a name. Tower is a name. Strong tower.
[2:13] Uh Olam, everlasting God. Ellejon,
[2:18] Elroy, all those are are names of God
[2:21] that reveal a relationship to man in a
[2:24] specific time. Amen.
[2:27] So the bread of God is a name that
[2:31] relates to the son
[2:33] and never anywhere else. You wouldn't
[2:36] find this name relating to the father
[2:39] because the bread of God which came down
[2:42] from heaven relates to the son. It's a
[2:45] relationship that occurs with man
[2:48] particularly after the coming of Christ
[2:51] and that's why it's part of um the son.
[2:56] Now to you and I, we read the Bible,
[2:59] you've read the scripture, John 6:33,
[3:02] for the bread of God is he which cometh
[3:04] down from heaven. Honestly, how many of
[3:05] you actually read that scripture and
[3:08] think, "Thank God for the bread of God.
[3:11] you know, I I eat that every day. I have
[3:15] such a great relationship with the bread
[3:17] of God. You you you and I don't think of
[3:20] it in that in that because Christ never
[3:23] preached that particular message to you
[3:26] personally
[3:27] and uh even though it's there and you
[3:30] are experiencing the name, what we are
[3:32] doing is you you want to worship God but
[3:36] you cannot worship him whom you don't
[3:38] know. That's why our series is called
[3:40] knowing God.
[3:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; The only way you can know God is unless
[3:45] he has revealed himself to you.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; And how has he revealed himself to you
[3:49] in every name in every age?
[3:53] &gt;&gt; In every relationship he has with man.
[3:56] And we need to see what relationship he
[3:58] has with us in this time. Which is why
[4:01] the bread of God is actually a very
[4:05] intimate, very close and personal
[4:08] relationship with you today. And you
[4:10] don't even realize that. We don't even
[4:12] realize that. So bread, the bread of God
[4:15] is a relationship between God and men.
[4:19] So let's start from the very beginning
[4:22] and track the relationship of bread and
[4:24] mankind.
[4:26] Genesis 3:19.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
[4:32] bread till thou return unto the ground.
[4:35] For out of it was thou taken. For dust
[4:38] thou art unto dust shalt thou return.
[4:41] Right?
[4:42] &gt;&gt; So right in the beginning it's the first
[4:45] time in the Bible you are seeing the
[4:47] word bread.
[4:50] All right? If I to ask anybody here what
[4:53] is bread?
[4:55] All of you would say it's that, you
[4:56] know, fluffy loaf that we slice and we
[4:59] make sandwiches with.
[5:01] How of you think Adam was making fluffy
[5:04] loaves?
[5:08] Was there even bread then? Adam, I don't
[5:11] think he was even making fire
[5:14] or or had an oven to make bread. So why
[5:17] would God say in Genesis 3 in the first
[5:21] time of creation telling Adam in the
[5:24] sweat of th of thy face shalt thou eat
[5:27] bread?
[5:29] Right? So bread in the Bible is a part
[5:33] of every meal spoken of. This is this is
[5:36] incredible. Forever after this whenever
[5:39] bread is spoken it's almost as if the
[5:41] people in the Bible ate nothing else but
[5:43] bread.
[5:46] Right. So bread publicly does not always
[5:51] refer to the bread that you and I eat
[5:53] today.
[5:56] &gt;&gt; It it doesn't in the Bible. It doesn't
[5:58] always refer to that when it in fact
[6:00] what we eat today the Bible identifies
[6:02] as cakes.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Literally the word cakes and Abraham
[6:07] made cakes.
[6:09] Right? But bread is not cakes.
[6:14] Right? In the Bible, bread means
[6:16] anything that is obtained for
[6:18] sustenance, for food, like a staple,
[6:23] something you're going to eat every day.
[6:24] That is your bread.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; Is that right? When This is why when you
[6:28] pray the Lord's prayer, give us this day
[6:30] our daily bread.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Yes. That's referring to a biblical
[6:34] terminology that has got nothing to do
[6:36] with bakers,
[6:39] &gt;&gt; brown bread or white bread or Albany,
[6:43] whatever you have in your area, that's
[6:46] not even bread. That's cakes,
[6:49] right?
[6:51] But we've gotten so used to it today
[6:52] that you know if your mom tells you,
[6:54] hey, go and buy bread from the store,
[6:56] you know what to get. You're not going
[6:57] to come back with vanilla cake, you
[7:00] know, or something else or or say, uh,
[7:02] you know, mom, for the whole week, we're
[7:05] going to eat steaks. That's going to be
[7:06] our bread.
[7:08] Jordan would love that.
[7:12] But when God spoke to Adam in Genesis
[7:15] 3:19, he was telling him that his
[7:18] sustenance, his food, his staple, what
[7:22] he's going to take to satisfy hunger. So
[7:26] what is bread? Bread is something that
[7:28] satisfies hunger. Amen. And it's not
[7:33] just that. Bread refers to prepared
[7:37] food.
[7:39] Right? So Adam's generation had to
[7:41] suffer with the curse to produce enough
[7:45] food and food that was good for their
[7:48] satisfaction.
[7:49] All right? So I want you to bear this in
[7:52] mind. Bread means anything that is
[7:54] obtained, anything that is extracted,
[7:58] anything that is used and prepared to be
[8:01] food. So you could Adam could take like
[8:04] uh I mean he wasn't going to he wasn't
[8:07] going to live on peaches and bananas and
[8:10] grapes and apples and for the rest of
[8:13] his life he's going to take things, put
[8:15] them together. He's going to mix up
[8:17] stuff and he's going to prepare
[8:19] something for him for them to eat. And
[8:22] anything that satisfies one's hunger. So
[8:26] before the fall, there was no curse.
[8:29] Adam could literally walk to a tree
[8:31] would produce fruit. He would eat the
[8:33] fruit. Wherever we would go, pluck corn
[8:36] from a from a corn plant and eat the
[8:38] corn. There was no no curse. There was
[8:42] no suffering. There was no, oh, we could
[8:44] wait for next season and we could have
[8:46] plant this. No, the earth was just
[8:48] growing and producing and they could
[8:50] eat. But now after the fall and after
[8:53] the curse, God told him, you are going
[8:56] to sweat.
[8:58] In other words, you are going to labor.
[9:00] You're going to work. In other words,
[9:02] food is not going to come easily
[9:04] anymore.
[9:06] Daily bread is not going to come easily
[9:10] anymore. So
[9:13] before the fall and before the curse,
[9:16] what did Adam feed on? What did Adam eat
[9:20] of?
[9:21] &gt;&gt; Right? You say, "Well, he just ate of
[9:23] the fruit of the trees because that's
[9:24] the evidence we have in the scripture."
[9:26] Is that right? So we have this amazing
[9:29] scripture in Deuteronomy 8:3 that
[9:31] everyone quotes, including Christ.
[9:34] And he humbled thee and suffered thee to
[9:36] hunger and fed thee with mana which thou
[9:39] kneest not. Neither do thy fathers know
[9:42] that he might make thee know that man
[9:45] doth not live. By bread alone, or only,
[9:50] but by every word that proceedth out of
[9:52] the mouth of the Lord doth man live.
[9:56] So this was a special kind of bread that
[9:58] Adam lived on before the fall.
[10:02] Because you don't live by bread alone,
[10:05] but by every word. So we know this. Why?
[10:09] Because Adam ate of all the trees,
[10:12] including the tree of life.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; He was not supposed to eat of the tree
[10:19] of knowledge of good and evil.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; The tree of life was not a special tree
[10:23] that produced a special glowing light
[10:27] fruit that gave you supernatural power
[10:30] to live forever. Tree of life is the
[10:32] word of God
[10:34] &gt;&gt; for your day.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in other words, Adam ate of
[10:38] natural food and the word of God.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:42] &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[10:44] by every word that proceeds out of the
[10:48] mouth of God. Is that right? So God was
[10:52] mysteriously telling man that he would
[10:54] only obtain God's word and his daily
[10:58] bread
[11:00] by sweating for it. So after the curse,
[11:04] natural food was going to be hard to
[11:06] come by and spiritual food because now
[11:10] that man has been excommunicated from
[11:12] God, he's been he's been let go. He is
[11:15] going to work hard to even get word from
[11:18] God.
[11:21] Is that right? What is hard work? Well,
[11:24] literally works. You're going to have to
[11:27] do the right thing. You're going to
[11:28] follow the rules. You're going to keep
[11:30] you're going to be moral. You're going
[11:31] to have to live righteously. And if you
[11:34] do the right thing, you be like Noah.
[11:35] You found grace in the eyes of God. And
[11:37] then God comes to you with the word,
[11:40] right? But it's going to take work
[11:44] by the sweat of your brow. Are you still
[11:47] with me?
[11:48] &gt;&gt; So both natural food and spiritual food
[11:51] was going to be hard work to obtain.
[11:54] Why? Because of unbelief.
[11:58] But the grace of God overpowers his own
[12:01] correction, his own chastisement on his
[12:04] children. God gives us curse, but his
[12:07] grace still uh brings us the word in
[12:11] every day just so that we don't starve.
[12:14] Amen. How do we know this? We literally
[12:17] have a scripture for that. Um well, I
[12:20] think I didn't put it in, but it's
[12:22] Psalms 37:25.
[12:24] David says, "I've been young and old and
[12:27] I have not seen the righteous begging
[12:29] for bread."
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; I love that because the righteous saints
[12:34] of God will not beg for revelation.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; Bread is is our revelation. Our
[12:41] revelation is our spiritual bread. That
[12:43] the word that God gives from his own
[12:46] mouth is our spiritual bread. Is that
[12:47] right? It's what our soul lives on. It's
[12:50] the only thing our souls can eat of.
[12:55] You see,
[12:57] you don't realize
[13:00] why things are the way they are in this
[13:02] world.
[13:05] When you were getting ready for church
[13:06] this morning,
[13:09] did a did a thought in your mind while
[13:12] you were taking a shower, putting on
[13:15] your clothes, or rushing to get to the
[13:17] car, rushing to get here early or
[13:19] something, did a thought ever cross your
[13:22] mind where you said, "What in the world
[13:24] am I doing? Why am I going to this
[13:27] church?
[13:29] What am I going to do there for the next
[13:30] two hours? Just sit there and look at
[13:32] this guy talking to me?
[13:35] Did it ever cross your mind thinking?
[13:38] What are all those people coming there
[13:40] together to do? Like don't we have
[13:42] something better to do?
[13:45] Why do other people in the city are they
[13:47] all going to different religious
[13:48] churches to go and sit down and listen
[13:50] to something? And those who are not,
[13:52] what are they doing?
[13:55] They are looking at the television or
[13:57] the internet or their phones.
[14:00] Do you realize more than half of your
[14:03] day whether you are Christian, message
[14:06] believer or atheist, you are feeding on
[14:09] words
[14:15] &gt;&gt; much more than even food.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Well, some people do food more but no
[14:21] judgment, you know.
[14:24] But the majority of people in this world
[14:27] do not realize there's something
[14:30] undeniable inside them that wants to
[14:33] feed on words.
[14:37] They cannot get away from it. So even if
[14:40] you don't find a church or a temple or a
[14:43] mosque or something, you are going to
[14:45] gravitate to something. You just can't.
[14:48] You know that feeling of being alone?
[14:51] I feel alone. I got to be with friends.
[14:55] What is it that you really want? Nobody
[14:57] goes and meets with friends and and be
[14:59] like.
[15:06] If you try that, you'll be like, I need
[15:08] a new friend. This guy doesn't even
[15:10] talk, you know. He doesn't talk. You
[15:13] know, I go there, things are so awkward.
[15:15] I say something, there's no conversation
[15:18] flowing. I think we need new friends.
[15:21] You don't need new friends. What you
[15:24] really want is words.
[15:29] People, we need to wake up. You need to
[15:31] know why you come here because something
[15:34] inside you recognizes I need words.
[15:39] That's the only reason you come here. I
[15:41] mean, the music isn't all that great.
[15:46] This You're welcome, brother Steven. the
[15:48] the singing isn't all that fantastic.
[15:53] You know,
[15:55] the pastor isn't the friendliest guy in
[15:58] the world,
[16:00] but there's the reason why you come here
[16:04] and the reason why your soul is
[16:06] attracted here is because of the words.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; That's the only reason. And everybody
[16:13] else in this city is doing what they
[16:17] want to do because of words that are
[16:20] satisfying their souls somehow. It's
[16:23] undeniable. Even an atheist loves words.
[16:30] So it's unmistakable that men
[16:33] eat natural food and spiritual food.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; But there's only one bread that gives
[16:41] ETERNAL LIFE. AMEN.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; ALL OTHER words that are not from God do
[16:46] not bring eternal life.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; That's why you are here.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; That's why you wake up early on Sunday
[16:53] morning and have that shower and dress
[16:55] up and put on your best clothes and eat
[16:57] your breakfast and rush and get ready to
[16:59] be here at this pointless unattractive
[17:02] place
[17:04] &gt;&gt; because of words. That's it.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; Right. because you don't even it's like
[17:10] instinct. Your soul needs words to
[17:13] survive.
[17:16] So God actually put all of mankind
[17:20] that's not in my notes by the way. I
[17:22] just realized that a lot of people don't
[17:24] realize why they do what they do every
[17:26] single day. Why they go to work, why
[17:29] they go to a certain school, why they go
[17:30] to a certain university, why they go to
[17:32] a certain why they choose a certain
[17:34] vocation. There's something inside of
[17:36] them and only words can satisfy that.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; Nothing else. Even the job that you do,
[17:42] it's because of words that makes the job
[17:44] worth the while.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; You just scrutinize it a little bit more
[17:48] and you'll understand everything I'm
[17:49] telling you is the truth.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; You try and do a job where nobody talks
[17:55] to you and tell me how you feel after a
[17:56] couple of days.
[17:59] You know, I felt it. I studied
[18:01] engineering. Then I got onto this this
[18:03] um beautiful power plant. The
[18:05] engineering was fantastic. And then I
[18:07] realized I'm working with cold hard
[18:09] metal and and you know with these uh
[18:12] valves and these things and none of
[18:13] these things talk back to me. And the
[18:16] only people that talk back to me is the
[18:17] guy in the walkie-talkie who's swearing
[18:19] all the time. And I'm thinking this
[18:21] isn't the life of me. This is just not
[18:24] going to work. I could feel it. I can't
[18:27] do this. I need to be in touch with
[18:29] souls and souls who are want to
[18:32] fellowship on God's word
[18:35] &gt;&gt; and even some souls who are going to
[18:37] listen to me. I want people to listen to
[18:39] me. So that job was definitely not going
[18:42] to work. So God put mankind through a
[18:47] lesson of bread for the ages. So if you
[18:50] go through the Old Testament, you're
[18:52] going to see an entire lesson of bread
[18:54] taking place. It's phenomenal, right?
[18:58] What I found astounding was that God in
[19:01] his mercy took his children through a
[19:04] lesson of bread through all generations.
[19:06] And why does he do that? As always, the
[19:09] answers are all in the types and the
[19:11] shadows. Everything in the Old Testament
[19:13] was a shadow to show the presence of
[19:16] something real that's going to come. So
[19:19] he he took them through this lesson of
[19:21] natural bread because there's going to
[19:23] be spiritual bread coming and there's
[19:26] going to be training with the natural
[19:28] bread. But when the spiritual bread
[19:30] comes, that training is going to apply.
[19:33] Amen. And then it happened. And that and
[19:37] when that bread actually came in our
[19:40] day, that wasn't all because there was
[19:43] more bread to come. The bread that came
[19:45] 2,000 years, it wasn't finished. there
[19:48] was more bread to come. Amen. So the
[19:52] first time we see bread
[19:55] uh baked bread I think is u in Genesis
[20:01] 14:18. This is where the Bible says
[20:04] Melkchisedc brings bread and wine to
[20:07] Abraham.
[20:09] That's the first time. We see one
[20:11] scripture where he says to Adam, you
[20:14] will eat bread by the sweat of your
[20:16] brow. But the first time you actually
[20:18] see somebody bringing bread is actually
[20:20] MelkiseDC.
[20:23] Who is MelkiseDC? He is God. King and
[20:26] priest of Salem.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; He who is without descent, without
[20:31] father, without mother,
[20:33] &gt;&gt; without genealogy. That's from Hebrews
[20:36] chapter 7. He is the prefigure of Christ
[20:39] that is to come. He brings bread to
[20:42] Abraham.
[20:44] Right? What kind of bread was that?
[20:47] And everyone thinks, well, it was like
[20:49] communion, you know, because we hear the
[20:51] prophet saying he served communion to
[20:54] Abraham.
[20:56] The second time we hear of bread is now
[20:58] Abram's turn. When he's seeing
[21:00] MelkiseDC, who is Elohim, coming to him,
[21:03] what does Abraham do? He goes and makes
[21:04] cakes
[21:06] &gt;&gt; in the plains of memory, Genesis 18:6,
[21:08] and kills the feted calf and brings milk
[21:11] with butter and everything. But there is
[21:13] bread again.
[21:14] baked bread. Now, I don't think it's a
[21:17] coincidence because uh then we find, you
[21:21] know, obviously Abraham learned this
[21:23] from MelkiseDC.
[21:25] Now, he's serving bread back to
[21:26] MelkiseDC. And then Lot must have heard
[21:29] this whole story. When the two angels
[21:31] came to Sodom to save Lot in Genesis
[21:35] 19:3, it says Lot makes unleavened bread
[21:38] to serve the angels. Now, I don't know
[21:41] about you, if you tasted unleavened
[21:43] bread, it's not very tasty. It's like
[21:45] flat and tasteless.
[21:48] So, why was Lot thinking he needs to
[21:51] make unleaven bread for the angels?
[21:54] There must have been some understanding
[21:56] they had about bread. Believe me, if I
[22:00] make unleaven bread for you and invite
[22:02] you to dinner, you're never going to
[22:03] come back again.
[22:06] It's really not that tasty. It's like
[22:08] flour and water mixed and and maybe a
[22:11] little bit of salt, I don't know, but
[22:12] nothing. It's not fluffy. It doesn't
[22:15] come out into a beautiful loaf. There's
[22:17] no sugar in it. You'll be like, "Man,
[22:20] these people are cheap like give us food
[22:23] like this." And Indians, oh my word,
[22:26] they can't even make their rotty nice,
[22:28] you know, because it kind of looks like
[22:30] rotty.
[22:32] But it's terrible. It's a Middle Eastern
[22:35] thing, right? that they that they used
[22:37] to dip in like balsamic vinegar and uh
[22:40] olive oil or something and they used to
[22:42] eat that with some kind of meat or
[22:44] vegetables or something that they had
[22:46] dates and things like uh um that's
[22:49] Middle Eastern food. But if you and I
[22:51] eat unleaven bread, trust me, you're not
[22:54] going to have more of it. No way. But
[22:58] Lot makes unleaven bread for the angels.
[23:00] I mean, was that the best he could do?
[23:03] Why would you make unleavened bread for
[23:04] the angels? Obviously, there's a kind of
[23:07] respect here like unleavened bread is
[23:10] meant for holy people,
[23:15] &gt;&gt; right? Abraham by revelation must have
[23:17] made the same bread though he was not
[23:20] even instructed by God to make this
[23:22] bread. So, we know that leavened bread
[23:27] is more attractive, bigger, fluffier,
[23:31] softer, tastier,
[23:34] right? Some of you are getting hungry.
[23:37] So, why make unleavened bread? Let's
[23:40] read Exodus 12:8.
[23:44] So, here's our first part of our our
[23:47] lesson of bread through the ages. Are
[23:50] you ready? Yes, sir.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[23:53] Sunday school, you're listening.
[23:56] Exodus 12 and:e 8. And they shall eat
[23:59] the flesh in the night, that is the
[24:01] roast lamb, with fire and unleavened
[24:05] bread, with bitter herbs, they shall eat
[24:07] it. So the first bread we come across
[24:09] now that is identified is unleavened
[24:12] bread. And God makes it a law that the
[24:16] Israelites keep the Passover with
[24:18] unleavened bread. Why? What's wrong with
[24:22] 11?
[24:24] All right. So, we we then read in
[24:26] Leviticus 23:5-6
[24:29] in the 14th day of the first month at
[24:32] even is the Lord's Passover. All right.
[24:34] So, 14th day and on the 15th day of the
[24:38] same month is the feast of unleavened
[24:41] bread unto the Lord. Seven days you must
[24:44] eat unleavened bread. So there's the
[24:46] first lesson on bread that God's
[24:48] children are learning. For the rest of
[24:51] the year, you can eat um leavened bread.
[24:55] You can put yeast. Yeast is the leaven.
[24:57] You can put yeast. It's a kind of
[24:59] bacteria that you put into bread to make
[25:02] it all fluffy and it when it gets in the
[25:04] oven and under the heat it just it it
[25:06] fluffs out and becomes this big loaf of
[25:08] bread. But for 7 days at the feast of
[25:12] Passover, you shall eat unleavened bread
[25:16] for 7 days. Right? So the feast of
[25:19] unleven bread started on the 15th which
[25:21] meant it would end on the 21st of the
[25:24] month. So far the type of bread we have
[25:27] seen that is a relationship to believers
[25:30] is unleaven bread.
[25:32] Right? So believers must have a
[25:35] relationship with unleaven bread. He's
[25:38] actually taking them through this in
[25:40] natural life that you need to have this
[25:43] relationship, right? God's not just
[25:46] doing this for, oh, it's so healthy to
[25:48] have this, you know, and once in a while
[25:51] you must fast and this fast must be with
[25:54] unleaven bread. There's a lesson that's
[25:56] going to happen here, right? Now,
[25:58] there's a distinction. This unleavened
[26:01] bread must be eaten with the Passover
[26:03] lamb,
[26:06] right? You're not going to have the
[26:08] Passover lamb where the blood was shed
[26:11] for salvation for your sin. You're not
[26:14] going to have this with leavened bread.
[26:16] You cannot have the lamb with leavened
[26:19] bread.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; You can eat anything else the rest of
[26:23] the year with the year with leavened
[26:24] bread. But when you eat the lamb, it
[26:27] requires unleavened bread.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Okay. There's a distinction. It's as if
[26:36] leavened bread is not an expression of
[26:39] God's relationship to men.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:43] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[26:45] &gt;&gt; God's relationship to men is is very
[26:47] different. So all other parts of your
[26:50] life, you have a relationship of leaven
[26:52] with everything else. But when it comes
[26:54] to the lamb of salvation, the
[26:57] relationship has got to do with
[26:59] unleavened bread.
[27:02] &gt;&gt; Is that right? So there's your first
[27:04] type of bread. Let's go to the next type
[27:06] of bread. Mana.
[27:09] Mana.
[27:11] Bread from heaven. Okay.
[27:15] Why does
[27:17] What does mana mean in sha? Anybody?
[27:21] Nothing. Why do I remember something
[27:23] close by? Never mind.
[27:26] I remember something but it's it's been
[27:28] a a long time. So this then appeared
[27:32] this other type of bread fell from
[27:34] heaven.
[27:36] But this bread, this manner, this new
[27:38] type of bread. Now it had laws. This
[27:41] bread came with law.
[27:44] Okay? If you didn't eat this bread with
[27:46] the law, this bread was not going to
[27:48] work well for you. Okay? Let's read it.
[27:51] Exodus 16 and verse 3-5.
[27:55] And the children of Israel said unto
[27:57] them, to God we had died. children of
[27:59] Israel complaining, right? You're not
[28:01] giving us good food. Would a God we had
[28:03] died by the hand of the Lord in the in
[28:05] the land of Egypt when we sat by the
[28:07] flesh pots when we did eat bread to the
[28:10] full for you have brought us forth into
[28:12] this wilderness to kill this whole
[28:14] assembly with hunger.
[28:16] Then said the Lord unto Moses, "Behold,
[28:19] I will rain bread from heaven for you."
[28:23] Now, it's the first time they're going
[28:25] to see bread falling from the
[28:28] atmosphere, or they're not even going to
[28:30] see it, but they're going to know it
[28:31] fell from the heavens somehow, right? I
[28:34] will rain bread from heaven for you, and
[28:37] the people shall go and gather a certain
[28:39] rate. There's the law. You can't gather
[28:43] everything. You can't gather over the
[28:45] limit. There's a law attached to mana.
[28:49] and that I may I'm giving you this law
[28:52] attached to this manner to prove you
[28:57] to see if you can keep the law
[29:00] right whether they walk in my law or
[29:02] not. So this bread came with conditions.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; That means there's a law that there
[29:08] there's bread that God can give you
[29:10] that's only going to function well if
[29:11] it's met with conditions.
[29:16] It's a very good teaching on word. And
[29:18] it shall come to pass on the sixth day
[29:20] they shall prepare that which they bring
[29:22] in and it shall be twice as much as they
[29:25] gather daily. In other words, um for the
[29:29] first five days,
[29:31] let's say Monday to Friday.
[29:34] Yeah. Or uh Sunday to Friday, right?
[29:37] You're going to you're going to no
[29:39] Monday to Friday. You're going to take
[29:41] one each. going to take a certain
[29:44] amount. That's the law. This bread is
[29:46] not going to work for you if you take
[29:48] more than that. That's as much as each
[29:51] person must take. But on the sixth day,
[29:53] you're going to take double the amount
[29:56] because on the seventh day, this this
[29:58] manner is not going to fall. So this
[30:00] manner is only going to fall for six
[30:02] days. But on the sixth day, you will
[30:04] take double the amount. So it'll last
[30:06] you over to
[30:08] the seventh day. Let's read in in Exodus
[30:12] um 16:14 to 15. And when the dew that
[30:16] was gone up, behold, upon the face of
[30:18] the wilderness, there lay a small round
[30:21] thing as small as the frost on the
[30:24] ground. So this this this man fell like
[30:27] little snowflakes. And the Bible kind of
[30:30] teaches it tasted like wafer that's
[30:32] mixed with honey. And it fell a small
[30:35] little white flex. It looked like
[30:38] coriander seed, right? Or coriander
[30:40] flour like that. And it fell all over
[30:43] the place. So you would go up and
[30:44] collect this thing. Nobody knew what it
[30:46] was, right? And uh verse 15. And when
[30:50] the children of Israel saw it, they said
[30:53] uh one to another, "It is mine now."
[30:58] For they whisped not what it was. And
[31:00] Moses said unto them, "This is the bread
[31:03] which the Lord hath given you to eat."
[31:05] Okay. So the word mana in the Hebrew or
[31:09] mana it is a question. It means what is
[31:15] it?
[31:17] So the children of Israel went out there
[31:19] and look picked it up. They were not
[31:21] calling it by a new name. They were
[31:23] saying what is it? Mana.
[31:26] So that's how the name stuck.
[31:29] See so from then on this new bread was
[31:32] called what is it?
[31:36] You know, I can imagine some mother
[31:38] telling a son, "Go out and get some.
[31:39] What is it?"
[31:42] has also a different meaning. Who is it?
[31:46] What is it? Or who is it? With the same
[31:49] uh word.
[31:51] So, the Bible tells us they didn't know
[31:54] what it was. In other words, this bread
[31:58] is a mystery to them.
[32:01] It's mysterious.
[32:03] They can't explain it, but it works for
[32:06] them as long as they keep the law.
[32:11] Are you seeing a lesson of bread?
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. There's literally a lot of the
[32:17] word of God that is given to you. It's
[32:18] only going to work for you if you keep a
[32:20] law, a condition.
[32:23] Okay. So, what's it symbolized? that
[32:26] bread from heaven WITH A MYSTERIOUS
[32:28] element came with a question and
[32:32] conditions attached.
[32:34] Moses told them what it was. He said,
[32:37] "This is the bread of God from heaven
[32:40] for you." He identified it. This is the
[32:43] bread which the Lord had given you to
[32:45] eat. Amen. So, this being the bread of
[32:49] heaven was then a shadow pointing to
[32:52] something that's going to come
[32:54] spiritually someday. There's going to be
[32:56] a bread that comes from heaven in the
[32:58] future, right? But for Israel, this
[33:02] bread lasted one day only.
[33:05] So, for the for the first five days,
[33:07] like I explained,
[33:09] uh you only gather one omr. Omar is a a
[33:14] um a measurement, I suppose. They had
[33:17] these all the same uh containers with
[33:20] exactly the same measurement. Now,
[33:22] here's the thing about this bread from
[33:24] heaven, this bread from the Lord. If you
[33:29] took more than one,
[33:32] if on Monday you went out AND YOU, OH,
[33:34] THIS STUFF, I LOVE THIS STUFF. TASTES
[33:35] LIKE WAFERS WITH HONEY. GATHER IT ALL
[33:37] UP. Don't tell anyone. Don't tell Moses.
[33:39] Let's take a second container.
[33:42] This bread has an intelligence in it
[33:45] that as soon as it hits Tuesday morning,
[33:47] it's filled with worms.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; They said it stank like maggots. You
[33:53] know what maggots?
[33:55] &gt;&gt; Maggots are worms that attach themselves
[33:57] to rotting material.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; They eat contaminated. How can God give
[34:02] you a bread that in the next day becomes
[34:05] contaminated?
[34:07] If you don't take it with the law, it
[34:10] becomes a stink.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; So this mana that fell from day one to
[34:20] day five could not last for more than
[34:22] one day. But amazingly on the sixth day,
[34:26] this mana decided I can last for one
[34:28] more day.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; It would literally rot overnight
[34:34] and be disgusting the next day. This
[34:37] word, this manner, this food from
[34:39] heaven, this food from the Lord would
[34:42] rot the next day and be disgusting that
[34:45] you couldn't even put it in your mouth.
[34:49] Oh, incredible.
[34:51] What kind of bread has a mind of its own
[34:54] &gt;&gt; to follow a schedule? A schedule like
[34:57] that. And what was the purpose?
[35:00] Literally, so I can prove you.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to give you food that's
[35:06] going to test you. It's going to prove
[35:08] you whether you can keep my law or not.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Incredible. The bread of the Lord became
[35:16] a stink the next day if you took more
[35:19] than you should have taken.
[35:22] And then Moses was told to gather up one
[35:25] day supply.
[35:27] This is amazing.
[35:30] Moses was this manner is we're not done
[35:32] with this manner. This what is it? Moses
[35:36] on the first time that this mana fell,
[35:38] God told him, "Now you go take an OMR.
[35:42] You gather up an R of that and then you
[35:44] take it behind the veil into the holiest
[35:47] of holies." And there the same manner
[35:50] would stay forever.
[35:54] And in the presence of God, that same
[35:57] manner was without any law,
[36:00] without any conditions.
[36:03] It did not fail. That one, even if Moses
[36:06] went in and took some out, it
[36:08] replenished
[36:11] and and you could eat it and eat and eat
[36:13] it and it would just replenish.
[36:16] It would not run dry. It would not rot.
[36:19] It had no law attached. It had no
[36:22] conditions.
[36:23] When that same word which was now
[36:26] brought into the earthly dimension
[36:28] behind the veil in the shakina glory, no
[36:31] conditions. Amen.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Same manner.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Right now, I wish I had some evangelical
[36:41] gift. I'll be all over the place.
[36:44] And so Moses did as God commanded. And
[36:48] this bread became eternal bread behind
[36:51] the veil. Its supply never failed and it
[36:55] would not corrupt or stink. Now, when
[36:58] you study the aspects of this bread from
[37:00] heaven, it's really quite fascinating.
[37:03] Now, I could take it right now. I'm not
[37:05] going to do that, but I'll just tell
[37:06] you, as long as you this bread is in the
[37:09] flesh, it comes with laws.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; When this bread goes behind the veil,
[37:14] there's no laws.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; There's no conditions. That bread keeps
[37:18] replenishing itself.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same word L the word of
[37:22] the Lord from heaven but on behind the
[37:25] veil there's no conditions when you take
[37:28] it in the Sabbath it will on the sixth
[37:30] day it will last you for two days but on
[37:33] all the other days if you take more than
[37:35] you can it'll kill you
[37:37] &gt;&gt; it's it's a stench it becomes
[37:40] denominational
[37:45] &gt;&gt; it becomes organized religion it just
[37:47] depends where you're taking it
[37:52] All right, you ready? There's another
[37:54] bread, showbread.
[37:57] So, there's another type of bread that
[37:59] we find after the tabernacle is built
[38:01] now. And uh um this type of bread
[38:05] emerges on their walk in the wilderness,
[38:08] right? God instructs them to make a
[38:11] bread that is only for the priesthood,
[38:15] the ministry because it is holy bread.
[38:20] What is holy,
[38:22] right? So you know you have all the
[38:24] children of Israel
[38:26] and you have the priesthood.
[38:29] The children of Israel were not holy.
[38:32] The priesthood was holy.
[38:35] What does that mean? But they all
[38:37] keeping the law. Keeping the law, doing
[38:39] good, being righteous is not holy. Holy
[38:42] means you are connected to the
[38:44] tabernacle.
[38:45] You are uh you your purpose is to the
[38:48] tabernacle. That's what holiness is.
[38:51] Holiness is you have a purpose to the
[38:54] service of God. That is a holy man,
[38:57] right? So a holy man is not somebody who
[39:01] uh walks around in white robes and
[39:04] doesn't touch any dirty thing and he
[39:06] doesn't live wrong and he's he doesn't
[39:08] say anything wrong. He never makes a
[39:10] mistake. No, a holy man can be a ruffian
[39:13] like John the Baptist who's filthy
[39:15] thinking doesn't speak right but he's
[39:17] connected to the purpose of God for his
[39:19] day. That is a holy man.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; So what is holy? You're connected to the
[39:24] temple.
[39:25] You have a job to do that is for God.
[39:28] You don't have another vocation on the
[39:30] side. A holy man is a man connected to
[39:34] the purpose of God. He lives his life in
[39:37] connection to that purpose. That is
[39:39] holy. Okay. Got it? So this is why this
[39:42] is holy bread.
[39:45] Only the priests could eat it. It is the
[39:48] Bible calls it hallowed bread. Hallowed
[39:51] bread is holy bread. It means that this
[39:55] bread now is not like mana which which
[39:58] feeds everybody. This bread only occurs
[40:01] within the veil, the first veil in the
[40:03] inner court. It's not even in the outer
[40:06] court. It's in the inner court where the
[40:09] candlesticks are. Are you with me? It's
[40:11] on the table of showbread.
[40:15] And this bread actually has leaven in
[40:18] it.
[40:20] Whoa.
[40:22] This is amazing, right? This bread uh is
[40:26] in the inner court. It has some leaven
[40:28] in it and it is for the priesthood.
[40:31] Okay, I love this. Let's read Leviticus
[40:34] 24 5-9.
[40:36] And thou shalt take fine flour and bake
[40:39] 12 cakes thereof. Two tent deals shall
[40:43] be in one cake. And thou shalt uh set
[40:47] them in two rows, six on a row, upon the
[40:49] pure table before the Lord. And thou
[40:51] shalt put pure frankincense upon each
[40:53] row that it may be on the bread for a
[40:56] memorial, even an offering made by fire
[40:59] unto the Lord. And verse 8 and verse 9,
[41:03] every Sabbath he shall set it in order
[41:06] before the Lord continually being taken
[41:09] from the children of Israel by an
[41:11] everlasting covenant. And it shall be
[41:14] Aaron and Aaron's and his sons. So this
[41:18] showbread is for Aaron and his sons. In
[41:21] other words, the priesthood, the
[41:23] Levitical priesthood. And they shall eat
[41:26] it in the holy place. Not the holiest of
[41:29] holies. The holy place. The holy place
[41:32] is the first, the inner court. The
[41:34] holiest of holies is behind the veil.
[41:36] Are you with us? So they're not allowed
[41:38] to eat this bread in their home. They're
[41:41] not allowed to eat this bread in the
[41:43] outer court. They can only eat this
[41:45] bread in the inner court.
[41:47] And this bread has a little bit of
[41:49] leaven in it
[41:52] in the inner court.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; So only a a holy man, a priest, one who
[42:00] served the word and the tabernacle could
[42:02] eat this bread. And it even has a weird
[42:06] name, showbread. What is showbre
[42:10] which literally is showbre
[42:14] as in exposed bread or
[42:19] revealed bread.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Now this bread also has law connected to
[42:27] it. It could it could only be eaten by
[42:30] priests. It could only be eaten in the
[42:32] inner court. And um it could not if you
[42:37] if you ate it anywhere else, you would
[42:38] die. God would kill you. You're not
[42:40] supposed to take this anywhere else.
[42:42] It's meant for the priesthood. It's
[42:43] meant for the inner court. Is that
[42:44] right?
[42:46] &gt;&gt; So along the way, as time goes by, the
[42:50] law of this bread is slightly adjusted.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; How? So we see in 1st Samuel chapter
[42:57] 21:3-6
[43:00] and therefore so oh let me explain this
[43:03] before we read this okay David and his
[43:06] men have been running
[43:08] from Saul and now they're they've been
[43:11] running for many days they had no food
[43:13] and they're absolutely hungry. It's been
[43:16] 3 days they're literally starving.
[43:19] They're almost dying from starvation and
[43:22] they come up to the tabernacle to the
[43:24] priests and all the priests have is
[43:27] showbre.
[43:29] So David comes up and he asked, "Now
[43:32] therefore, what is under thine hand?
[43:34] Give me five loaves of bread in my hand
[43:36] or what there is present." And the
[43:38] priest answered David and said, "There
[43:40] is no common bread under mine hand."
[43:42] Means I don't have any other bread for
[43:44] you, but there is hallowed bread. And
[43:46] the priest says, "If, look at the
[43:48] condition, if the men have kept
[43:51] themselves at least from women."
[43:56] &gt;&gt; And David answers the priest and said
[44:00] unto him, "Of a truth woman have been
[44:03] kept from us about 3 days since I came
[44:05] out." And the vessels of the young men
[44:07] are holy. That means they are have been
[44:10] committed to the purpose of God. And the
[44:12] bread is in a manner common. Yay, though
[44:15] it was sanctified this day in the
[44:17] vessel. Verse six, so the priest gave
[44:21] him hallowed bread,
[44:24] they not priests now.
[44:26] &gt;&gt; David is of the tribe of Judah and his
[44:29] men of the same and are with him. They
[44:32] are not priests now. They're giving them
[44:35] priests bread.
[44:37] They're not priests and they're not in
[44:39] the inner court.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:42] For there was, in other words, this
[44:44] bread is actually been taken out of the
[44:46] inner court. First law broken.
[44:49] And then given to someone else who is
[44:51] not of the tribe of Levi. Second law
[44:54] broken. It doesn't even mean it's
[44:56] breaking. It means the law is being
[44:58] adjusted
[45:00] &gt;&gt; for the tribe of Judah.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; What's happening with showbread? What
[45:06] we're seeing is now the law is being
[45:09] shifted. It now can be only eaten by a
[45:12] king and a priest.
[45:17] &gt;&gt; But for the regular men to eat. So David
[45:19] is the king, but his men are not. So the
[45:23] king and the priest can eat it. But
[45:24] there's also a condition allowed where
[45:27] you can also eat this if you have not
[45:30] been defiled with women for at least 3
[45:33] days.
[45:35] Oh my. Can you see these lessons of
[45:37] bread
[45:38] &gt;&gt; throughout the scripture? Why is this
[45:40] significant? Because in the church ages,
[45:43] we have this criterion written in symbol
[45:45] form. You can read in revelations 20 uh
[45:49] 2 20-22.
[45:51] Um, notwithstanding, I have a few things
[45:53] against thee, because thou sufferest
[45:54] that women Jezebel, which call itself a
[45:57] prophetess, to teach and to seduce my
[45:59] servants to commit fornication,
[46:01] spiritual fornication, and to eat things
[46:03] sacrificed unto idols. And I gave her
[46:06] space to repent of her fornication. And
[46:08] she repented not. Behold, I will cast
[46:11] her into a bed, and them that commit
[46:14] adultery with her into great
[46:15] tribulation, except they repent of their
[46:18] deeds. So I'll cast her into a bed,
[46:21] right? A relationship and those that
[46:24] commit adultery with her. Okay. Chapter
[46:28] 14 verse 3 to 4. And this is the 144,000
[46:33] standing on the mount with the lamb. And
[46:36] it says, "And they sung a new song
[46:37] before the throne and before the four
[46:39] beasts and the elders. And uh no man
[46:42] could learn that song but 144,000
[46:44] thousand which was redeemed from the
[46:47] earth." These are they which were not
[46:49] defiled with women,
[46:52] &gt;&gt; for they are virgins. These are they
[46:54] which follow the lamb whethersoever he
[46:56] goeth.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; These were redeemed from among men being
[46:58] the first fruits unto God and to the
[47:00] lamb. So what we have is in the book of
[47:03] revelations, it tells you those who were
[47:06] thrown into great tribulation or those
[47:09] thrown into damnation were those who
[47:11] were defiled with Jezebel. But there are
[47:13] these people who learned the song
[47:17] which is a song coming from heaven from
[47:19] the bride 144,000 and they are only
[47:22] learning that song because THEY ARE NOT
[47:24] DEFILED WITH WOMEN.
[47:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; JUST AS THOSE WHO ARE SINGING THE song
[47:30] were not defiled with women.
[47:33] What does it mean? What does it mean?
[47:35] Defiled with women.
[47:38] The symbol in revelation being defiled
[47:40] with women means organized religion.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Or denominationalism.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; So watch how it works. Now those who
[47:49] were linked to the women Jezebel could
[47:52] not eat of the showbread,
[47:57] right?
[47:58] &gt;&gt; You could be the priesthood, but if you
[48:01] were defiled with women, this bread is
[48:03] not going to work for you. In other
[48:05] words, this bread which has some leaven
[48:08] in it which ripens under the light of
[48:11] the candlestick.
[48:13] Right? So what happens in the inner
[48:15] court is this bread which is meant for
[48:17] the priesthood which has a little bit of
[48:19] leaven. It li it ripens under the the
[48:22] light of the messengers.
[48:24] It becomes fluffier and becomes
[48:26] something that can be fed to the people.
[48:30] It's something that the ministry can
[48:32] receive and serve the people. Is that
[48:35] right?
[48:36] &gt;&gt; So this light of the messengers ripens
[48:40] this to the ministry.
[48:42] Why to the ministry? And why is the
[48:44] leaven in it? Because of where we are
[48:46] living. What is the ministry to do? Is
[48:48] to deal with people. IS TO TAKE THE word
[48:50] and make it applicable to human life.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; There is leaven in there. And under the
[48:56] light of the candlestick, it can be it
[48:58] can grow. It can ripen. This is the work
[49:01] of the ministry. We are supposed to take
[49:03] the word of God and make it applicable
[49:06] to corrupt human life
[49:08] &gt;&gt; and and bring teaching from the inner
[49:12] court in the spirit realm and bring the
[49:14] word so that it can be used uh in your
[49:18] lives of Lev.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Amen.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; AND THIS CAN ONLY APPLY IF THERE IS the
[49:24] priesthood, if there is Judah the king
[49:27] or if the people have kept themselves
[49:29] from organized religion.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. They're the only conditions
[49:32] with showbread.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; And what is showbre? Revealed bread.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Why would you need revealed bread?
[49:42] Because you are living in this life of
[49:43] sin. You're living in leaven. You are
[49:46] living in this life of corruption. There
[49:48] is word that's been there that's been
[49:50] taught and there's leaven in there. But
[49:51] it will only ripen under the light of
[49:54] the messengers.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So those who were linked
[50:00] to Jezebel in the church ages could not.
[50:02] But then after 3 days of Luther, Wesley
[50:06] and Pentecost breaking away from
[50:08] Jezebel, there comes a time where the
[50:11] believer who is no longer defiled with
[50:14] women.
[50:16] Come out of her, my people.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Be no longer partakers of her evil ways.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Right? You come out of her after three
[50:23] days and you eat the revealed word meant
[50:26] for priests and kings. Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; So through David, God makes the
[50:31] showbread for kings and priests. But
[50:33] David took and gave to his men and the
[50:35] qualified only. They qualified only
[50:38] because they were not defiled with women
[50:40] for at least 3 days. So the Bible
[50:42] indicates that that makes you holy
[50:45] because if you are separating yourself
[50:48] from organized religion, you are now
[50:51] joining yourself to the service of God.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; And that's what makes you holy.
[50:58] Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So far, we've been through
[51:02] these uh breads in the Old Testament,
[51:05] right? And it just gets more and more
[51:07] exciting.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to breads of Elijah.
[51:13] Did you know there were breads of
[51:15] Elijah?
[51:16] Okay, let's go to First Kings 17:6. You
[51:20] know what was the first bread Elijah
[51:22] encountered?
[51:24] Raven's bread.
[51:26] And the ravens brought him bread and
[51:29] flesh in the morning and bread and flesh
[51:31] in the evening. And he drank of the
[51:33] brook. We don't know what this bread
[51:35] was, but we know ravens, they steal.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; So they were stealing bread from
[51:41] somewhere and bringing bread to Elijah.
[51:44] Now, we're not talking about this bread
[51:46] is talking about sustenance.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[51:49] &gt;&gt; they may not have been bringing him
[51:50] cakes or bread from the bakery. whatever
[51:54] food they could find that was edible,
[51:56] they were bringing him all kind. It
[51:57] could have been meat. This bread he was
[51:59] eating could have been meat, could have
[52:00] been dates, could have been um olive
[52:04] seeds or whatever um olive fruit or what
[52:08] we call olives. They could have been
[52:10] bringing him all sorts of stuff and that
[52:12] was the bread that the ravens were
[52:14] bringing,
[52:16] stolen bread.
[52:18] Ravens are scavengers and perhaps they
[52:20] were instructed BY GOD, GO AND steal
[52:22] bread for Elijah,
[52:25] &gt;&gt; right? So, they were bringing bread to
[52:27] Elijah from other people. We don't know.
[52:31] But Elijah could not live on Raven's
[52:33] bread. He had to leave, right? Because
[52:37] it was a time of famine and he
[52:39] prophesied the famine and the rains was
[52:42] going to come. So now he's suffering
[52:44] under his own prophecy
[52:46] &gt;&gt; and the ravens he's living on stolen
[52:48] food, right? And he has to leave raven's
[52:51] bread and he has to go look for this
[52:53] widow of Zarapath.
[52:56] Now he goes to the widow of Zarapath and
[52:59] we find the bread of Elijah and the
[53:01] widow, second bread of Elijah.
[53:05] So he arose and went to Zarapath or
[53:07] Sarapa. And when he came to the gate of
[53:09] the city, behold, the widow woman was
[53:11] gathering of sticks. Uh uh and he called
[53:15] to her and said, "Fetch me, I pray thee,
[53:17] a little water in a vessel that I may
[53:19] drink." And as she was going to fetch
[53:21] the water, he called to her and said,
[53:23] "Bring me, I pray, thee, a morsel of
[53:25] bread in thine hand."
[53:27] So he's asking this woman for bread.
[53:31] And she said, "As the Lord thy God
[53:34] liveth, I have not a cake, but a a
[53:37] handful of meal in a barrel, and a
[53:39] little oil in a cruise, and behold, I'm
[53:41] gathering two sticks that I may go in
[53:43] and dress it for me and my son, that we
[53:44] may eat it and die." We have the last
[53:47] little bit of meal and oil, and we're
[53:50] going to bake this. We're going to eat
[53:51] our last bit of food. And what a
[53:53] horrible situation.
[53:55] I mean, you don't think long enough on
[53:57] that. Can you imagine this this child of
[54:00] God, this this prophet of God comes up
[54:02] there and there's this woman. She's
[54:04] literally telling you, "We have our last
[54:05] Buddha food. After we eat this, my son
[54:08] and I have resolved. We're going to die
[54:10] from starvation."
[54:14] Right? And Elijah said unto her, "Fear
[54:17] not. Go and do as thou has said, but
[54:20] make me thereof a little cake first.
[54:23] Bring it unto me, and after make for for
[54:26] thee and for thy son." She just told
[54:28] him, "We only have enough for my son and
[54:31] I to eat." Uh, he says, "Don't worry,
[54:35] this is a prophet. See, listen, Elijah,
[54:38] he's telling you, don't worry. Just go
[54:40] and make for me and then go make for for
[54:43] your son and for you."
[54:46] And she's, you know, like you and I
[54:48] today, all bright spots today must have
[54:50] been thinking something wrong with this
[54:52] guy. The feminine maybe tapped in the
[54:55] head a little bit. I just told you we
[54:57] have only enough. How do you expect me
[54:59] from what I have to make for you first?
[55:02] Then go like if after I make for you,
[55:05] where am I going to get the stuff for me
[55:06] and my son afterward?
[55:08] &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Don't worry.
[55:11] Thus sayeth the Lord, it's going to
[55:12] happen. You're just going to have to
[55:14] take my word for it. You're just going
[55:16] to have to believe."
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Of course, she was a believer.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Kind of like what's happening today,
[55:23] right?
[55:25] For thus said the Lord God of Israel,
[55:28] the barrel of meal shall not waste,
[55:30] neither shall the curse of oil, the
[55:32] cruise of oil fail until the day that
[55:35] the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. So
[55:38] he just told her,
[55:40] "Don't worry, for thus says the Lord,
[55:44] after you do what I tell you, the oil
[55:47] and the meal will not fail until the
[55:50] prophecy is fulfilled." Mhm.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Oh my, there's a lot in there. Verse 15.
[55:57] And she went and did according, this is
[55:58] the bride. She went and did according to
[56:02] the saying of the prophet. And she and
[56:05] he and her house did eat many days.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Right? What is the condition with this
[56:12] bread?
[56:14] The prophet has to be present. The pro
[56:17] this this bread is only this this
[56:19] prophecy is only going to last until the
[56:21] day the prophecy ends.
[56:24] Right? Verse 16. And the barrel of meal
[56:28] wasted not. Neither did the cruise of
[56:30] oil fail according to the word of the
[56:32] Lord which he spake by Elijah.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; The Lord spake by Elijah.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is the bread with another
[56:44] condition. The woman has to make the
[56:46] bread to sustain herself. But the
[56:48] ingredients of the bread, which is the
[56:50] meal and the oil. So are you I I think
[56:54] you just missed that.
[56:57] The prophet's word is only going to
[56:59] produce meal and oil.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; You have to make the bread.
[57:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; You have to read the books.
[57:07] Unfortunately,
[57:12] &gt;&gt; he's not going to prepare it for you.
[57:15] So like for all these people who want
[57:16] brother Barams was to just prepare it
[57:18] for you
[57:19] &gt;&gt; and just make it all make sense.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; IT MUST ALL BE PERFECT AND
[57:24] UNDERSTANDABLE and it must not stumble
[57:27] me. It must not say any No, I'm sorry.
[57:30] You got to make the bread.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; He's just provided the ingredients and
[57:35] it's only going to last until the days
[57:37] of the prophecy are fulfilled
[57:39] &gt;&gt; because thereafter you're going to need
[57:41] something special.
[57:44] Amen. What is it? Obviously, the woman
[57:47] types the church and this is a time of
[57:49] famine where bread is scarce. What is
[57:52] bread? Prepared food.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; Not just prepared food, but the
[57:57] ingredients for prepared food is scarce.
[58:02] These people think, "Oh, we must leave
[58:04] the prophet and go back to the Bible."
[58:09] You can't EVEN PREPARE FROM THE BIBLE.
[58:11] YEAH.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; You can't even look at what they're
[58:14] doing with the Bible. You take the Bible
[58:17] and you're producing all kinds of food
[58:19] that's it's not even going to last. It's
[58:22] and you take in more than you can. It's
[58:23] like mana which fell for you. There are
[58:26] conditions that go with it.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what written word is.
[58:33] The prophet comes in during this time of
[58:34] famine. Imagine we actually have the
[58:38] Bible
[58:40] in this world and there is a famine of
[58:42] the word of God.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; In churches,
[58:46] &gt;&gt; people are dying of hunger
[58:50] with the Bible.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; A prophet comes in during the time of
[58:56] famine. She makes her choice. She takes
[58:58] a risk taking him in and housing him.
[59:01] But as long as he's there, the
[59:03] ingredients of bread does not fail. I
[59:06] don't have to preach enough on that for
[59:08] you to realize what the prophet's
[59:10] presence means to you during the time of
[59:14] famine.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that doesn't stop there with
[59:18] Elijah because then it ends and after
[59:20] his time with the widow of Zarapath, he
[59:23] now has to move on and there's another
[59:26] bread that he lives by. This is bread
[59:29] from the angel. So not ravens anymore.
[59:33] Now he's being chased again because now
[59:35] after his time with this this true
[59:38] church,
[59:39] he's now running for his life from his
[59:41] accusers,
[59:43] from the system of Jezebel. He's running
[59:46] for his life. What's he going to do now?
[59:48] He's just a prophet. How's he going to
[59:51] feed himself? Right? He's just a
[59:54] prophet.
[59:56] First Kings 19:4 But he himself went a
[59:59] day's journey into the wilderness and
[1:00:01] came and sat down under a juniper tree
[1:00:03] and he he requested for himself that he
[1:00:05] might die. Even prophets have time of
[1:00:08] weakness.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Lord, just let me die. Can't take it
[1:00:12] anymore. I'm running for my life. I I
[1:00:14] once dramatized this to you. I I
[1:00:17] explained to you what Elijah must have
[1:00:19] went through. They were pursuing him
[1:00:22] through the wilderness. He was hiding
[1:00:24] behind sand dunes, behind bushes, behind
[1:00:27] rocks, looking for caves, through heat,
[1:00:31] through the night. They were pursuing
[1:00:33] him. They were chasing him. He was
[1:00:35] escaping them, but he couldn't take it
[1:00:38] anymore. He had reached mental fatigue,
[1:00:42] bodily fatigue, no food to eat, no water
[1:00:46] to drink. He was at the end of his
[1:00:49] tether.
[1:00:50] People don't realize this when they read
[1:00:52] the story.
[1:00:54] Amen.
[1:00:56] Lord, take away my life for I am not
[1:00:58] better than my fathers. I can't make it.
[1:01:00] All those stories I heard that happened
[1:01:02] with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all
[1:01:05] those great men. Clearly, I don't have
[1:01:07] the faith of my fathers. Lord, I'm done
[1:01:09] for. You ever have those days?
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:15] And as he lay and slept under the
[1:01:16] juniper tree, behold, then an angel
[1:01:19] touched him and said unto him, "Arise
[1:01:21] and eat."
[1:01:23] Amen. And he looked, and behold, there
[1:01:25] was a cake baked on the coals, and a
[1:01:28] cruise of water at his head, and he did
[1:01:31] eat and drink and laid him. So, what do
[1:01:33] you think? Apparently, there's a cake
[1:01:36] baked bread on the coals. So this angel
[1:01:40] put coals and fire and got ingredients
[1:01:43] and baked bread for him and he's eating.
[1:01:46] And you think, "Oh, that's great." You
[1:01:48] know, that's good. We understand that.
[1:01:52] Nothing supernatural about that. No,
[1:01:56] it gets worse or better.
[1:02:00] Where am I?
[1:02:02] Yeah. And the angel of the Lord came
[1:02:04] again the second time and touched him
[1:02:07] and said, "Arise." So he ate the first
[1:02:10] time and he was still too weak. The
[1:02:14] bread the angel gave him the first time
[1:02:16] didn't even do enough. It sustained him.
[1:02:19] It kept him alive and he passed out
[1:02:21] again. When it says he went back to
[1:02:22] sleep, it means he was passed out
[1:02:24] unconscious. That's how weak he was. Now
[1:02:27] the second time the angel comes him and
[1:02:30] tells him arise and eat because the
[1:02:32] journey is too great for thee. What
[1:02:34] you're about to to experience next
[1:02:38] is too much. You need to eat. Got it?
[1:02:43] And he arose the second time did eat and
[1:02:46] drink and went in the strength of that
[1:02:50] meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb
[1:02:54] the mount of God.
[1:02:56] This is not just some cake that's made
[1:02:57] on the fire.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; What kind of I'd like to have some of
[1:03:02] that
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; makes me go 40 days and 40 nights.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; He went in the strength of that meat
[1:03:07] that he ate when the angel touched him a
[1:03:10] second time. What we are about to see
[1:03:12] happening here is man shall not live by
[1:03:15] bread alone but by every word that
[1:03:18] proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; There's something greater than the the
[1:03:22] bread in Sera. There's something greater
[1:03:25] than raven's food. There's something
[1:03:27] greater than mana from heaven. There's
[1:03:29] something greater than word that comes
[1:03:30] with conditions. There's a word that
[1:03:33] comes with an angel that descends FROM
[1:03:35] HEAVEN THAT MAKES YOU GO WITH A
[1:03:37] SUPERNATURAL FILLING
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; THAT GOES FOR DAYS THAT SUSTAINS YOU
[1:03:41] THAT COMES WITHOUT LAWS.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THIS IS THE JOURNEY FOR
[1:03:46] THE THIS IS THE FOOD FOR THE JOURNEY
[1:03:47] THAT IS TOO GREAT.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What kind of bread was
[1:03:52] this? And we see this happening because
[1:03:55] we see this in Moses, right? Moses goes
[1:03:58] up into the mountain and he was there
[1:03:59] with the Lord 40 days and 40 nights. Did
[1:04:02] neither eat bread nor drink water
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; and he wrote upon the tables the words
[1:04:08] of the covenant. It means here again
[1:04:11] Moses is eating something that Elijah
[1:04:14] had. What was he eating? The word.
[1:04:18] THE WORD OF GOD THAT COMES FROM THE
[1:04:20] MOUTH OF GOD THAT SUSTAINED YOU FOR 40
[1:04:22] DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS.
[1:04:25] Praise be to God.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; We know this happened when Christ
[1:04:28] himself who is the bread from heaven.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Who is the word himself went into the
[1:04:34] wilderness TO BE TESTED LIKE EVERY OTHER
[1:04:36] MAN. And the tempter comes to him and
[1:04:38] says to him, "You look hungry. You look
[1:04:41] like you could do something tasty. You
[1:04:43] have the power. Why not turn your stones
[1:04:45] into bread?" And his answer was
[1:04:48] Deuteronomy.
[1:04:49] Man shall not live by bread alone, but
[1:04:52] by every word that proceeds out of the
[1:04:54] mouth of God. It is written.
[1:04:59] Amen. You know, I recently heard someone
[1:05:01] say um uh against the prophet,
[1:05:06] right? These people I've been getting a
[1:05:09] lot of this. You can imagine the last
[1:05:10] two weeks I saw some ministers say it's
[1:05:14] the written word. We must take it back
[1:05:16] to the written word. JESUS ONLY SAID the
[1:05:19] written word. When the tempter came to
[1:05:21] him, he said, "It is written. It is
[1:05:22] written. It is written."
[1:05:25] How could they not see the last part?
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; The last part was, "Get thee behind me,
[1:05:31] Satan." Which was not written.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; It was It COMES TO AN END WHEN WHEN THE
[1:05:38] ENEMY HAS HAD ENOUGH AND AND THERE'S NO
[1:05:40] MORE YOU CAN SAY THAT IS WRITTEN. You
[1:05:42] got to have something inside that speaks
[1:05:45] from your HEART AND SAYS, "GET THEE
[1:05:47] BEHIND ME, SATAN."
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; You got to have an ANSWER TO THE DEVIL'S
[1:05:51] QUESTION. AT SOME POINT, YOU STOP
[1:05:53] REASONING with what is written.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; And you got TO HAVE SPOKEN WORD WITHIN
[1:05:57] YOU.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That's where their
[1:06:00] argument falls apart. We come to this
[1:06:03] time where everything they're taking us
[1:06:04] back to the Bible. Back to the Bible.
[1:06:06] What is written? What is written? You
[1:06:08] have a sp a scripture that literally
[1:06:10] tells you the letter killth but the
[1:06:12] spirit gives life.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; You take everything BACK TO WHAT IS
[1:06:15] WRITTEN UP TO A POINT
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; and then you've got to have word in you
[1:06:19] that says get thee behind me
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Satan.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Here when Jesus is tempted he invokes
[1:06:27] Deuteronomy 8:3. This lesson on natural
[1:06:30] bread that had taken place 4,000 years
[1:06:33] under the law was a prefigure of what
[1:06:36] was going to happen with spiritual bread
[1:06:38] with the emergence of the Lord Jesus
[1:06:40] Christ. So now we come to Jesus part
[1:06:42] three, the bread from heaven.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Are you ready?
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; All right. So John chapter 7, we're
[1:06:48] going to do Christ and bread.
[1:06:51] Now we're going to see the same lesson
[1:06:54] of bread in Christ. All that happened in
[1:06:57] the Old Testament now happens here with
[1:07:00] Christ. And we even see all the
[1:07:02] manifestation and the development of it.
[1:07:05] So John 7:41.
[1:07:07] Others said this is the Christ, but some
[1:07:10] said that uh shall Christ come out of
[1:07:11] Galilee? Hat the scriptures said that
[1:07:14] Christ um uh that the Christ cometh of
[1:07:17] the seed of David and out of the town of
[1:07:19] Bethlehem where David was?
[1:07:21] All right.
[1:07:24] How many of you have your phones here?
[1:07:27] Yeah, take out Google. I'm giving you
[1:07:32] I'm giving you permission to Google
[1:07:34] something.
[1:07:38] What does Bethlehem mean?
[1:07:45] What does Google it and tell me
[1:07:47] something? First person tell me what
[1:07:49] does Bethlehem mean?
[1:07:53] Yes, brother.
[1:07:55] the house of bread.
[1:07:58] Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the house
[1:08:01] of bread, which is the which is where
[1:08:03] David came from. So this whole story of
[1:08:06] bread literally starts where he is born.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Right? And he comes preaching and starts
[1:08:15] off with warning about a certain type of
[1:08:19] bread we started with, right? Matthew
[1:08:22] chapter 6 verse 5.
[1:08:25] So he's born in the house of bread.
[1:08:28] That's no coincidence. I mean, he could
[1:08:30] have been born anywhere, right? Bethl,
[1:08:32] he could have been born in Beth Shebar.
[1:08:35] Um,
[1:08:37] he could have been born anywhere. He
[1:08:39] could have been born in Jerusalem, but
[1:08:40] he was born in the house of breath. Um,
[1:08:44] Matthew 6 uh 16:5-12.
[1:08:47] Are you with us?
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; And when his disciples were come to the
[1:08:51] other side, they had forgotten to take
[1:08:53] bread. There's a story about bread. Now,
[1:08:55] SO HIS DISCIPLES, WHO ARE THESE
[1:08:58] DISCIPLES? So maybe you don't know.
[1:08:59] Let's be before we go to them.
[1:09:02] In the Jewish custom, if there is a
[1:09:05] rabbi among you, a rabbi is a teacher.
[1:09:08] He's your master. He's a he's the one
[1:09:11] who's teaching you the scripture and
[1:09:13] giving you the the word of God for YOUR
[1:09:14] DAY. YOU RESPECT your rabbi. So wherever
[1:09:18] your rabbi goes, you as his disciples
[1:09:21] are following him. You are making the
[1:09:24] travel arrangements. You are collecting
[1:09:26] the food for the journey. You, it's your
[1:09:28] job to prepare the lunch. He's supposed
[1:09:30] to go and answer questions and teach the
[1:09:32] word. You're supposed to take care of
[1:09:34] everything. Now they're in trouble
[1:09:36] because they forgot to take bread.
[1:09:40] Right now, here's the problem.
[1:09:43] Jesus said unto them, "Take heed and
[1:09:46] beware of the leavenven of the Pharisees
[1:09:49] and of the Sadducees."
[1:09:51] Now he knows they had forgotten to take
[1:09:54] bread
[1:09:55] for the journey and he senses in them
[1:09:59] this worry. What is the master going to
[1:10:02] say? We've been irresponsible.
[1:10:04] We didn't even think to take bread.
[1:10:06] We're in trouble with him. And he
[1:10:08] discerning them says, "Beware of the
[1:10:10] leaven."
[1:10:12] He stays on the topic of bread, right?
[1:10:15] And they reasoned among themselves,
[1:10:17] saying, "It is because we took no
[1:10:19] bread." When Jesus perceived, he said
[1:10:21] unto them, "Oh, you have little faith.
[1:10:23] Why you did I miss something?"
[1:10:26] Oh, yeah. They reasoned among
[1:10:27] themselves, saying, "It is because we
[1:10:29] have taken no bread." So, they're
[1:10:30] thinking, he's talking about the leaven
[1:10:32] of the Pharisees because they took no
[1:10:34] bread. So he says to them, when Jesus
[1:10:38] perceived, he said unto them, "Oh ye of
[1:10:40] little faith, why reason you among
[1:10:42] yourselves because you have brought no
[1:10:44] bread? Do you not yet understand,
[1:10:46] neither remember the five loaves or the
[1:10:49] 5,000 and how many baskets you TOOK UP?"
[1:10:52] SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. The disciples
[1:10:55] were walking with Christ EVERY DAY. THEY
[1:10:58] WERE JUST GOING ACROSS the sea JUST
[1:11:00] AFTER HAVING FED 5,000 with a great
[1:11:04] miracle where it was said, "Surely this
[1:11:07] is the Christ, the Messiah." Because of
[1:11:11] this miracle that was done, right? They
[1:11:14] just seen that. Now they go across the
[1:11:16] sea with him and they're worried about
[1:11:18] breadh.
[1:11:28] All you'd have to do is sit with me and
[1:11:29] say, "Master, give us more of that
[1:11:32] bread, please." Right?
[1:11:35] No. Do you not yet understand? Neither
[1:11:38] remember the five loaves of the 5,000.
[1:11:41] Verse 10. Neither the seven loaves of
[1:11:43] the 4,000 and how many baskets you took
[1:11:45] up. Right? How is it that you do not
[1:11:48] understand that I spake it not to you
[1:11:50] concerning bread?
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; So, I wasn't talking about natural
[1:11:54] bread. I'm talking about the spiritual
[1:11:57] bread of the Pharisees that you should
[1:12:00] beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
[1:12:02] and the Sadducees. Then understood they
[1:12:05] how that he b them not beware of the
[1:12:08] leaven of natural bread but of the
[1:12:10] doctrine of the Pharisees and of the
[1:12:13] Sadducees. Right? So he told them the
[1:12:17] leaven of the Pharisees which was that
[1:12:19] which was uh which the leavenven of the
[1:12:22] Pharisees created a nature in them. to
[1:12:25] make them doubt,
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; okay? And and feel like they needed to
[1:12:31] have taken extra care in case they got
[1:12:36] hungry and starved. Like you were with
[1:12:39] the creator
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; who just fed 5,000 one and 4,000
[1:12:43] another. You're with him. If there was a
[1:12:46] mistake, come on.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; He'll make food out of anywhere.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; HE'LL BRING FISH. He'll bring anything.
[1:12:53] We're with the creator himself. What put
[1:12:56] this leaven in you?
[1:12:59] Be aware of that. So they should have
[1:13:01] just known and said, "Lord, give us
[1:13:03] bread." That was the leaven of the
[1:13:06] Pharisees. So what was the leavenven of
[1:13:07] the Pharisees? This intellectual
[1:13:10] uh conception of the word. This
[1:13:12] intellectual manipulation of the law of
[1:13:16] God by the Pharisees. In other words,
[1:13:18] they were taking the law of God and
[1:13:20] putting their own manipulation into it.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; So the the leaven of the Pharisees was
[1:13:26] the interpretation of the word that they
[1:13:28] were putting into it that was bringing
[1:13:30] fear and doubt in the people.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that leaven or that bread that
[1:13:37] the Pharisees gives you brings a
[1:13:39] believer absolutely no personal strength
[1:13:42] to act by faith.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Psalm 20:17 says, "The bread of deceit
[1:13:50] is sweet to a man,
[1:13:53] but afterwards his mouth is filled with
[1:13:55] gravel."
[1:13:58] So bread of deceit, that's what the
[1:14:01] Pharisees give you. This uh doctrinal
[1:14:05] manipulation,
[1:14:07] it's sweet. It's wonderful. Hallelujah.
[1:14:09] Praise the Lord. Glory. jumping up,
[1:14:11] shouting and but afterward your mouth is
[1:14:13] filled with stones,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; gravel. Are you with me?
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; All right. So now I want to get to the
[1:14:20] main scripture before we close this
[1:14:22] down.
[1:14:24] Uh so in Matthew 15:23-26,
[1:14:27] you remember uh we we're going to be
[1:14:30] speaking about Jesus, the bread of God,
[1:14:32] the bread from heaven. Okay, you
[1:14:35] remember we spoke about this recently,
[1:14:36] the Syrphenician woman who came to him
[1:14:38] and she's she's asking for healing for
[1:14:41] her daughter, remember? And he then says
[1:14:45] to her,
[1:14:46] he says to her, "It's not right. It's
[1:14:49] not meat for me to give the children's
[1:14:52] bread to dogs."
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; She didn't ask for bread. She asked for
[1:14:58] healing for her daughter. Why is he
[1:15:01] talking about bread? But she picks up
[1:15:04] the revelation and says, "Yes, Lord, but
[1:15:06] we take the crumbs."
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; She stays with the analogy of bread with
[1:15:10] him. She's got a revelation. She knows
[1:15:13] what he's talking about, right?
[1:15:16] She knows he's talking about himself.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; He is the bread for the children.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not meant for you,
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; but Lord, we can benefit from the
[1:15:27] crumbs.
[1:15:29] She actually knew what the bread was.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; She understood. Okay. So, let's go to
[1:15:35] John chapter 6. Now,
[1:15:38] John chapter 6 from verse 4, you start
[1:15:41] to see where these thousands of people
[1:15:43] were there and people were, if you read
[1:15:47] all the way from John 6:4, you're going
[1:15:49] to see the story of where the 5,000 are
[1:15:51] fed. Right? So, I'm just going to give
[1:15:53] you quickly so we can get through each
[1:15:54] scripture. So the people follow him
[1:15:58] across Galilee after he's fed them
[1:16:00] because they're looking for more food,
[1:16:03] natural food, right? So if we read,
[1:16:06] Jesus took the loaves and when he had
[1:16:08] given thanks, he distributed to the
[1:16:10] disciples. Now this is from verse 11.
[1:16:13] You can go home and read from verse 4.
[1:16:15] But from verse 11, he took the loaves
[1:16:18] and give thanks and so on and and uh it
[1:16:20] was and the fishes and it was multiplied
[1:16:23] over the 5,000. Verse 12. When they were
[1:16:26] filled, he said unto his disciples,
[1:16:28] "Gather up the fragments that remain
[1:16:30] that nothing be lost." And when they
[1:16:32] gathered up, in other words, what was
[1:16:34] left over? These hungry poor people ate
[1:16:38] to their hearts content AND THERE WAS
[1:16:40] STILL SO MUCH LEFT over that they
[1:16:43] gathered up of the five bales which
[1:16:46] remain over and above 12 baskets.
[1:16:50] Then those men when they seen the
[1:16:52] miracle that Jesus said this is that
[1:16:55] true prophet that should come into the
[1:16:57] world. Are you with us?
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. So then we go to verse 26. Now
[1:17:03] they before we go there now they come to
[1:17:06] Jesus and they start asking him they
[1:17:09] want they want him to give them more
[1:17:12] food. But it was so uh devious. They saw
[1:17:17] him cross Galilee. They saw where his
[1:17:19] disciples were. They saw his disciples
[1:17:20] were not with him at a certain point and
[1:17:23] then they said, "Let's go. Let's go.
[1:17:24] Let's go across." So they they also all
[1:17:27] took boats and they went across the the
[1:17:29] sea and then they uh they meet up with
[1:17:32] Jesus and they said, "Hey, fancy meeting
[1:17:34] you here." Like, "Lord, when did you get
[1:17:37] here?" They went there w with false uh
[1:17:41] uh uh purpose as if to say, "Well, it's
[1:17:44] a coincidence. We arrived here, too.
[1:17:49] He's like, I know you skeleums in South
[1:17:53] Africa. See, I know you. You are seeking
[1:17:58] natural food. You're just following me
[1:18:00] around cuz you want your bellies filled.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Well, that's not what he said, but
[1:18:04] that's what he meant, right? And then
[1:18:07] they want they want meat. In other
[1:18:10] words, prepared food. They want bread.
[1:18:12] Jesus answered and said, "Verily I say
[1:18:13] unto you, you seek me not because you
[1:18:16] saw the miracles, but because you did
[1:18:18] eat of the loaves and were filled." Now
[1:18:21] that you were satisfied.
[1:18:23] Labor not for the meat which perishes,
[1:18:26] but for the meat which endures unto
[1:18:28] everlasting life. Now watch this. Which
[1:18:31] the Son of man shall give unto you, for
[1:18:33] him that God that God the Father sealed.
[1:18:36] What are we looking at, saints? He's now
[1:18:38] telling you that the meat that perishes.
[1:18:42] Where did we see this in the Old
[1:18:43] Testament? Meat that perishes is mana,
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; which came with a condition,
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; which came with law. He says, "Your
[1:18:51] fathers ate that and are dead."
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; They're not You're not just thinking
[1:18:56] about Moses. You're thinking about the
[1:18:57] Pharisees.
[1:18:59] They're taking the law and manipulating
[1:19:02] it and not realizing the same law that
[1:19:05] they're eating without the correct usage
[1:19:08] is bringing death to them.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; He says, "But there is a meat which
[1:19:15] gives everlasting life and it only is
[1:19:18] given by the son of man ministry."
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AMEN.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; WE'RE ONLY GOING TO have meat or bread
[1:19:27] which gives eternal life if there is a
[1:19:29] son of man ministry.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; This is why today there has to be a son
[1:19:35] of man ministry.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; ANY OTHER TYPE of meat that you can
[1:19:39] take, you can preach the Bible till you
[1:19:41] blew in the face.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; It's going to become meat that perishes
[1:19:45] because it's not given by a son of man
[1:19:48] ministry.
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So they listen to this
[1:19:53] and they ask him a question. Then said
[1:19:56] they unto him, "What shall we do that we
[1:19:58] might work the works OF GOD?" SO THEY'RE
[1:20:00] UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE'S SAYING.
[1:20:03] Are you with me? These people are not,
[1:20:05] they just been fed, so they should be
[1:20:07] understanding,
[1:20:08] right? And Jesus answered and said unto
[1:20:10] them, "This is the WORK OF GOD. THIS IS
[1:20:13] ALL THE WORK YOU must do. Believe on him
[1:20:16] whom he has sent." Oh my goodness.
[1:20:20] If ever we see something happening right
[1:20:23] now in our world in the message, they
[1:20:26] are no longer believing on him
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; whom he has sent.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; This is the work you're supposed to have
[1:20:33] been doing. Believe on him whom he has
[1:20:37] sent. They said therefore unto him,
[1:20:39] "What sign? Show us thou then that we
[1:20:43] may see and believe." In other words,
[1:20:44] they realize, "Okay, okay. You're saying
[1:20:47] you're the person who has been sent.
[1:20:50] What sign can you show? Listen, please
[1:20:53] open your eyes and read. These people
[1:20:55] are not.
[1:20:58] They're church people.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; They're Bible readers.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; They're churchgoers.
[1:21:04] THEY KNOW WHAT he's saying.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; They're not misinterpreting him.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; When he says something like, "Believe on
[1:21:11] him whom he HAS SENT." HE'S SAYING THEY
[1:21:14] KNOW HE'S SAYING BELIEVE on me.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; There's no mystery there. They're
[1:21:19] understanding this.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; So then THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ASKING,
[1:21:23] "OKAY, if you want us to believe, you
[1:21:25] show us a sign. What sign can you
[1:21:28] produce that we might believe?" Which
[1:21:30] means the people want signs
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; to believe the word.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; And the bride doesn't do that.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; The bride believes the word.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; And the signs follow. Yes.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; And if there's no signs, we still
[1:21:45] believe the word. Like the widow OF
[1:21:47] ZARAPATH, THERE'S NO SIGN.
[1:21:49] &gt;&gt; GO DO WHAT I TELL YOU.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; AND SHE DOES WHAT THE PROPHET TELLS HER
[1:21:54] AND THEN THE SIGN comes in
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; and the oil and the meal does not
[1:21:58] diminish.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; But they want to sign first.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; And if the sign doesn't satisfy them,
[1:22:06] they reject the word,
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; which is what's happening,
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; right? So they said, now they're asking
[1:22:12] him for a sign that their fathers saw.
[1:22:15] And our fathers did eat mana in the
[1:22:18] desert. Our fathers ate what is it?
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Our fathers ate unrevealed food.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Can you give us more unrevealed food?
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
[1:22:35] Now watch, they're becoming even more
[1:22:36] specific.
[1:22:38] Not just uh unrevealed food, not just
[1:22:42] the mana from heaven. We want bread from
[1:22:45] heaven. He gave them bread. In other
[1:22:48] words, he's saying, they're saying to
[1:22:49] him, can you bring mana?
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Can you show us bread from heaven?
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Then we'll believe you. In other words,
[1:22:57] they're even debating with him,
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; the son of man, what kind of sign they
[1:23:03] would like for them to believe in him.
[1:23:07] Whoa.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; This generation, my Then Jesus said unto
[1:23:12] them, verily, verily, I say unto you,
[1:23:15] Moses gave you not that bread
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; from heaven, and my father giveth you
[1:23:21] the true bread from heaven.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; THAT WHAT YOU GOT IN Moses was not even
[1:23:27] the real thing.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; But what has come today is
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Verse 33. And for the bread of God is
[1:23:36] he, THE BREAD OF GOD IS a person.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; He which cometh down from heaven and
[1:23:43] giveth life unto the world.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he discerns their falsehoods
[1:23:47] immediately. They are not really
[1:23:49] interested in the word. They just want
[1:23:51] to feed their stomachs. He said that
[1:23:54] Moses gave them natural manner. But the
[1:23:56] father gives true bread from heaven, the
[1:24:00] bread of God. There's the name of God.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; That was being revealed. The bread of
[1:24:06] God.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] So the bread of God, there's the the
[1:24:12] revelation of the bread of God. The
[1:24:15] bread of God is he which comes from
[1:24:18] heaven,
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; which come down from heaven and giveth
[1:24:21] life unto the world. So
[1:24:24] then comes one of the most blatant and
[1:24:26] outright statements ever made by the
[1:24:29] Lord Jesus Christ. Listen, saints,
[1:24:33] go back home and read the story. John
[1:24:35] chapter 6. Read it all through. Read it
[1:24:38] with the Holy Spirit leading you. Okay?
[1:24:43] Read it like you're going to dissect
[1:24:44] every single verse out and put yourself
[1:24:47] in the place. When you read it, think of
[1:24:51] what they are asking. Think of how he's
[1:24:53] answering because this is what's
[1:24:55] happening today, right? So the next
[1:25:00] statement in verse 34, then said they
[1:25:04] unto him, Lord, ever more give us this
[1:25:08] bread. Which means the son of man brings
[1:25:11] out a revelation to say
[1:25:15] it's got to do with the seventh seal.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; It's got to do with the coming of the
[1:25:18] Lord. It's something that is like
[1:25:22] wetting their appetites. It is telling
[1:25:25] them it's at hand. and they're saying,
[1:25:28] "Okay, now we're talking.
[1:25:32] Lord, give us this bread." So, THEY'RE
[1:25:35] WILLING TO ACCEPT WHAT HE'S ABOUT TO
[1:25:36] GIVE THEM. THEY'RE PRIMED. THEY'RE SET
[1:25:39] FOR IT. IT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN. HE TOLD
[1:25:42] THEM, "There's a vision. There's going
[1:25:44] to be
[1:25:46] something coming down from heaven
[1:25:49] and there's going to be bread and it's
[1:25:52] GOING TO BRING AN END TO THE FAMINE."
[1:25:56] LORD, ever more give us this bread.
[1:25:58] That's what all the sincere Christians
[1:26:00] in the world are saying. Lord, give us
[1:26:02] this bread.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; And then he does. And what happens?
[1:26:07] Right? So, I'm not going to read because
[1:26:09] it's going to take too long. From verse
[1:26:11] 35 to verse 40, he says to them, I am
[1:26:15] the bread.
[1:26:17] I am the bread of life. I am the bread
[1:26:19] that has come down from heaven. And then
[1:26:22] he explains to them who he is and what
[1:26:24] is his purpose. That's from verse 35 to
[1:26:26] verse 40. Verse 41 says they are
[1:26:30] offended that he identifies himself as
[1:26:32] the bread from heaven.
[1:26:36] There it is. This is what happens under
[1:26:39] the seventh seal. This is why there is a
[1:26:40] rejection of the third pole ministry
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; because this is what it does.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; FIRST THEY'RE SAYING YES, YES, WE WANT
[1:26:48] THE BREAD. GIVE US MORE. We love this
[1:26:51] first pool and second pool and this we
[1:26:53] love all this. Give us this bread, Lord.
[1:26:55] And then he identifies it. THE SEVENTH
[1:26:57] SEAL BREAKS. HE IDENTIFIES WHO IT IS.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; And then they are offended.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; And they understood HIS WORD PERFECTLY.
[1:27:09] I came down from heaven.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; The bread the father gives is he which
[1:27:16] comes down from heaven. Lord, give us
[1:27:17] this bread. I am he which came down from
[1:27:20] heaven.
[1:27:22] Now what happens is verse 43 to verse 42
[1:27:27] here's the the unbelief setting in how
[1:27:29] can he say this
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; we know he's just the son of
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; Joseph and Mary
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; he's just a carpenter's son what does he
[1:27:39] mean he came from heaven we know he
[1:27:41] didn't come from heaven
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; right and what happens is they're
[1:27:45] starting to get angry
[1:27:47] THEY JUST ASKED FOR IT
[1:27:50] EVER LORD, GIVE US THIS BREAD. HE'S NOW
[1:27:53] GIVING THEM THE BREAD. The bread which
[1:27:55] WILL GIVE THEM ETERNAL LIFE. THE MESSAGE
[1:27:57] IS ACTUALLY TELLING you what's going TO
[1:27:59] GIVE YOU ETERNAL LIFE. AND YOU'RE
[1:28:01] TURNING IT DOWN,
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? And their reasoning kicks in. We
[1:28:07] know where you're from. We know all your
[1:28:10] story.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; We know all your inconsistency. We know
[1:28:14] your grammar. We know what you said
[1:28:15] there. We know where you came from. What
[1:28:17] do you mean you came from heaven?
[1:28:22] And then he drops the bomb.
[1:28:26] He tells them there's really nothing you
[1:28:29] can do about it. He said, "Don't worry.
[1:28:31] Don't stress your mind about it. There's
[1:28:33] no way you're going to get this anyway
[1:28:35] because in this the ones who are going
[1:28:37] to come are only those that my father
[1:28:39] draws.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Don't stress about it.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; You go your way. There's nothing you can
[1:28:44] do to understand this
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; because this is not for you.
[1:28:50] Right? And he says, "And thereafter,
[1:28:54] they're already angry. And now he hits
[1:28:56] him. The thunders breaks open, brother."
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; He says, he tells them, "You have to eat
[1:29:03] my flesh
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; and drink my blood."
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; right? And it's crazy what happens.
[1:29:12] Verily, I say unto you, he that
[1:29:14] believeth on me hath everlasting life. I
[1:29:16] am the bread of life. Your fathers ate
[1:29:19] mana in the wilderness and are dead.
[1:29:21] Whatever church you come from, WHATEVER
[1:29:23] DENOMINATION YOU HAVE, HOWEVER YOU EAT
[1:29:25] THE BIBLE, WHATEVER YOU DO WITH THE
[1:29:27] WORD, YOU HAVE CORRUPTED YOURSELF AND
[1:29:29] ENDED UP IN IDOLATRY. THEY ARE ALL DEAD.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE bread which come down from
[1:29:34] heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[1:29:36] not die. I am the living bread which
[1:29:38] come down from heaven. If any man eat of
[1:29:40] this bread, he shall live forever. And
[1:29:42] the bread, THERE'S THE THUNDERS BUSTING
[1:29:45] OPEN. THE BREAD THAT I GIVE IS MY FLESH.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; AND WHICH WHICH I WILL GIVE FOR THE LIFE
[1:29:51] OF the world. Can you imagine how angry
[1:29:54] they while he's talking?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; The Jews therefore strove among
[1:29:57] themselves. How can this man give us his
[1:29:59] flesh to eat?
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[1:30:02] verily, I SAY UNTO YOU, EXCEPT YOU EAT
[1:30:05] THE FLESH OF THE SON OF MAN AND DRINK
[1:30:08] HIS BLOOD, you have no LIFE IN YOU."
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; THIS SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. HE'S
[1:30:14] NOT OFFERING EXPLANATIONS.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; They understood him before.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; What's the problem now?
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Right? When he spoken code before, they
[1:30:26] understood him perfectly.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you want us to believe you.
[1:30:30] Give us a sign. They understood it. But
[1:30:32] now he SAYS, "EAT MY FLESH AND drink my
[1:30:34] blood." That's why I always say to you,
[1:30:36] that's his third bull ministry.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; This is where everyone turns against
[1:30:39] him, including the 70. Amen.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; Even all THOSE PEOPLE YOU FIND AFTERWARD
[1:30:44] says and a lot of the disciples
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; said this is too much.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Those who walked with him a long time
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; said this is too much.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; We cannot take this.
[1:31:01] He now starts showing them showbread
[1:31:05] which is revealed word inviting them
[1:31:07] into the inner court
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; and they cannot take it because of the
[1:31:11] leaven of the Pharisees. Why can they
[1:31:13] not understand THIS? BECAUSE THEY ARE
[1:31:15] DEFILED BY WOMEN
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE SPIRIT OF
[1:31:19] ORGANIZED RELIGION.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; THEY WANT TO apply rules to the son of
[1:31:23] man. HE'S GOT TO BE TAKEN BACK TO
[1:31:26] DEUTERONOMY 18. HE'S GOT TO BE JUDGED BY
[1:31:29] THE SCRIPTURE. HE'S GOING TO BE THE You
[1:31:31] can't do this to a son of man ministry.
[1:31:34] And we're not talking about brother
[1:31:35] Brandham. We're talking about the son of
[1:31:36] man ministry.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; SEPARATE IT. Know what we're talking
[1:31:41] about.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; They cannot take it. He tells them if
[1:31:46] you only eat of natural food now, you
[1:31:49] will die. But what this means is if you
[1:31:51] only live by the first and second pool
[1:31:53] seeking signs and wonders. This is
[1:31:55] another thing happening in the message
[1:31:57] churches. They're trying to ask for
[1:31:58] signs.
[1:32:00] THEY'RE GOING BACK TO THAT OLD THING.
[1:32:02] THEY'RE FOLLOWING THEM ACROSS THE OCEAN.
[1:32:04] FEED OUR BELLIES. Give us MORE OF THAT
[1:32:06] EXCITING FOOD. GIVE US MORE OF THOSE
[1:32:09] signs and wonders. Give us more of that
[1:32:11] that message that makes us FEEL GOOD.
[1:32:13] THAT FEELGOOD MESSAGE. GIVE US THAT that
[1:32:16] we may BE FILLED. THAT'S WHAT'S
[1:32:18] HAPPENING. An evil generation seeketh
[1:32:21] after signs.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing wrong with signs,
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; but believe the word first.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:30] take it. YOU MIGHT EVEN GO THROUGH many
[1:32:32] years without even seeing a single sign,
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; but it's going to prove that you have
[1:32:38] taken the word.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what happened to those in
[1:32:42] the wilderness. You can see this same
[1:32:44] mistake repeating in our day, saints.
[1:32:47] They are consistently searching for the
[1:32:48] meat that perishes. They're not seeking
[1:32:51] the bread that came down from heaven in
[1:32:53] our day. All right. So, let's go to our
[1:32:56] day.
[1:32:59] Oh, I forgot to read this. It gets even
[1:33:02] worse. As the living father sent, that's
[1:33:04] like a that's like a like a like
[1:33:06] swearing an oath. As the living father
[1:33:09] has sent me and I live by the father. He
[1:33:12] that eateth me.
[1:33:15] Like he's saying the same thing in a
[1:33:16] more horrific way. FIRST SAID, "EAT MY
[1:33:19] FLESH, DRINK MY BLOOD." NOW HE THAT
[1:33:21] EATETH ME, he shall live by me. This is
[1:33:24] the bread which came down from heaven,
[1:33:26] not as your fathers did eat mana and are
[1:33:29] dead. This this uh the they ate mana
[1:33:32] which still had a question in it. WHAT
[1:33:34] IS IT?
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; THIS THAT I'M GIVING TO YOU. THERE'S NO
[1:33:38] QUESTION IN IT.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; IF YOU EAT THIS BREAD, IT GIVES YOU THE
[1:33:41] ANSWER TO THE DEVIL'S QUESTION.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; HE THAT EATETH of this bread shall live
[1:33:46] forever.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Which brings us to our day. So everybody
[1:33:52] in closing, what about our day? Who is
[1:33:55] the bread of God for your day? Who is
[1:33:59] the bread OF GOD? NOT WILLIAM BRANDOM.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; For all the skeptics, that's not what
[1:34:04] we're saying.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; It's the son of man.
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; It is the son of man who came down from
[1:34:11] heaven.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; This is the mystery under the seventh
[1:34:14] seal. This is what people deny when the
[1:34:17] word is identified before them. They do
[1:34:20] the same thing. Aren't you just a man?
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Aren't you the son of so and so?
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Didn't you say this? Didn't you do we
[1:34:30] know what are you making of yourself?
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; And they're offended by the third pole.
[1:34:35] They want it.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Reveal to us THE SEVENTH SEAL. WHEN IT
[1:34:39] is revealed,
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; we're offended.
[1:34:43] Can you do you believe? Let's go to
[1:34:46] reveal. Let's see showbread in our day.
[1:34:49] Right. Here we go. Revealed word. What
[1:34:52] this is unveiling of God paragraph 333.
[1:34:54] What's the shakina of glory today? To
[1:34:56] break beyond the veil to see who God is
[1:34:58] standing before you. See who God is
[1:35:00] standing before us. The pillar of fire.
[1:35:02] He is veiled in human flesh. But what
[1:35:05] does the shikina what did it do? The
[1:35:07] showbread seed. The word that we're to
[1:35:10] live on in this day by these promises,
[1:35:12] the shakina glory ripens that showbread
[1:35:15] brings it to pass, makes it bread to the
[1:35:18] believer that laid in the pages of the
[1:35:20] Bible.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; YEAR AFTER YEAR FOR THIS AGE. SO WHAT'S
[1:35:24] HE TELLING US? OKAY, let's read on. To
[1:35:26] the denominations is a stumbling block.
[1:35:28] To the denominations they stumble at it
[1:35:30] down through the years. What's he
[1:35:32] talking about? Luther, Wesley, Martin
[1:35:33] Luther, Sanki, Finny, John Smith, NOX
[1:35:35] ALL STUMBLED AT WHAT? written word
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; that was not ripened.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Because it was not brought into the
[1:35:43] inner court under the light of the
[1:35:45] messengers.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Right. So what's it to be done in the
[1:35:50] last days? What is it? What is to
[1:35:53] reveal? To bring forth. So showbread is
[1:35:57] taking the written word that was not
[1:36:00] revealed putting it under revelation
[1:36:02] light and let the written word bring
[1:36:05] forth. Yes.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; If you don't bring the Bible into the
[1:36:09] Holy of Holies, you're not going to
[1:36:12] understand the written word.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; We have showbread today.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; we have that.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. To turn what watch it ripen and
[1:36:23] produce just exactly what it said it
[1:36:25] would do, the showbread for this age to
[1:36:28] the denomination a stumbling block, a
[1:36:30] bunch of fanatics. But we who believe.
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have been invited into the
[1:36:36] inner court by the message of the hour.
[1:36:38] Without the light of the candlesticks,
[1:36:40] the message of the inner court, the
[1:36:41] Bible would just remain theory AND
[1:36:44] STORIES FOR GENERATIONS. But under the
[1:36:47] light of Malachi 4, it ripens into
[1:36:50] showbread.
[1:36:52] This is why your Bible speaks.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; And it becomes alive.
[1:36:58] SO THEN HE TAKES US FROM showbread now
[1:37:00] and now he takes us into behind the veil
[1:37:04] right listen I could go to hidden life
[1:37:06] the message hidden life and talk to you
[1:37:08] about the what Moses brings out from the
[1:37:11] golden POT WE COULD DO all that we'll
[1:37:13] spend so much of time on that but I
[1:37:15] don't want to I want to get to what's
[1:37:16] happening in our day right
[1:37:19] are you feeding on the flesh of the son
[1:37:20] of man
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; because that's what he said in John 6
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:37:25] &gt;&gt; if you have to eat my flesh and drink my
[1:37:27] blood. Right? He obviously was not
[1:37:30] talking about it literally. We saw that
[1:37:33] man cannot live by bread alone, natural
[1:37:36] food. So the bread he was TALKING ABOUT
[1:37:38] WAS SPIRITUAL FOOD.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; He was So let me let me put it to you
[1:37:43] this way.
[1:37:45] Here's here's WHAT HE WAS HERE'S WHAT
[1:37:47] JESUS was saying to them in John 6.
[1:37:50] You now have to take the word that I
[1:37:53] give you only.
[1:37:57] Any other word is not going to give you
[1:38:00] eternal life.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; Any other blood will not save you. Any
[1:38:06] other sacrifice will not give you
[1:38:09] salvation for your transgressions.
[1:38:11] All salvation and nourishment of the
[1:38:14] word comes through me cuz I came down
[1:38:18] from heaven. That's what he told them.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; They knew that and rejected it.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Right now, the flesh of the son of man,
[1:38:28] anointed ones of the end time. Uh he
[1:38:32] says paragraph 269. Now, I want you to
[1:38:35] know this is short that you listen to
[1:38:37] this tape. You might have thought today
[1:38:39] that I was trying to say that about
[1:38:40] myself.
[1:38:42] For all those who said he was saying it
[1:38:43] about himself, he actually says I was
[1:38:45] not. Being that I was packing this
[1:38:48] message, I have no more to do with it
[1:38:50] than nothing. No more than just a voice.
[1:38:53] SO I'VE GOT NOTHING ELSE TO do with it
[1:38:55] except my voice is being used.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; See, don't be those who knows what he's
[1:39:00] saying and then rejects it.
[1:39:03] You know what he's saying, right? And my
[1:39:06] voice even against my better judgment.
[1:39:08] In other words, I feel like he could
[1:39:09] have used somebody else. I wanted to be
[1:39:12] a trapper, but it's the will of my
[1:39:14] father that I declare to do and
[1:39:15] determined to do. I wasn't the one that
[1:39:17] appeared down the river. I was only
[1:39:20] standing there when it happened. I'm not
[1:39:23] uh the one that, let me see where I am.
[1:39:26] I WAS ONLY STANDING THERE. I'M NOT THE
[1:39:28] one that performs these things and
[1:39:29] foretells these things that happens as
[1:39:31] perfect as they are. I'm only the one
[1:39:32] that's near when he does it. I was only
[1:39:37] the voice that he used to say it.
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't what I knew. It's what I
[1:39:43] just surrendered myself to
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; that he spoke through. It isn't me. It
[1:39:48] wasn't the seventh angel. Oh, no. It was
[1:39:51] the manifestation of the son of man.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; It's been said,
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; who is the only one that can give you
[1:40:07] the bread from heaven? the son of man.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; it wasn't me. He says, I was the only
[1:40:13] one standing. That was only the voice.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; It It was the manifestation of the son
[1:40:19] of man.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Right? It wasn't It wasn't Jesus from
[1:40:23] 2,000 years ago.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; It was Jesus manifesting himself through
[1:40:27] a vessel.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; That was the manifestation
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; of the son of man.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel his message. It was
[1:40:36] it was the uh the mystery that God um
[1:40:40] unfolded. It's not a man,
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; it's God.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; See, this is what they stumble at. This
[1:40:48] is John 6 happening.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Because now today, what they're saying
[1:40:56] is, "How can you call yourself God?
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; We know who you are." Amen.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; When he says it's not a man, it's God.
[1:41:05] In his mind, he's being told to say what
[1:41:09] he has to say.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; What he has to say is going to make many
[1:41:14] reject it.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; And only the few who will accept it.
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; IT IS SPOKEN IN THIS WAY so that it will
[1:41:23] challenge their hearts and only those
[1:41:25] who believe will receive.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what are you going to believe?
[1:41:32] THE RIGHT THING.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE SAYING
[1:41:36] YOU'RE JUST a man.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; You're making yourself more. You and I
[1:41:40] who believe are saying we're looking
[1:41:42] beyond this man.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; We know he's just a man.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; But we see beyond the veil. THERE'S
[1:41:48] SOMEONE ELSE STANDING THERE. AND THAT'S
[1:41:50] THE VOICE THAT'S SPEAKING TO ME INSIDE.
[1:41:53] Because this man with all his confusion
[1:41:55] can have no ability TO EXPLAIN TO ME
[1:41:57] WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE right now. This
[1:42:00] has to be somebody else. I can see
[1:42:02] behind the veil.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; The son of man, he goes on, is Christ.
[1:42:08] He's the one that you're feeding on.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT JOHN 6 HERE.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; This is, dare I say, supernatural taking
[1:42:18] place here BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME
[1:42:20] REVELATION of John 6 happening.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; You're not feeding on a man. a man, his
[1:42:26] words will fail, but you're feeding on
[1:42:28] the unfailing body word
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; of the son of man. HE'S ACTUALLY saying
[1:42:34] you're feeding on the flesh,
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; the same words,
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; body, word
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; of the son of man.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; If you haven't fed on every word to give
[1:42:44] yourself strength to fly by all these
[1:42:45] denominations and things of the world,
[1:42:48] you will you at this time do it while we
[1:42:51] pray. This is exactly John chapter 6,
[1:42:54] saints of God. It is a call to move away
[1:42:56] from meat that perishes and take that
[1:42:59] which gives eternal life. The
[1:43:01] Pentecostal movement abused it until it
[1:43:03] roted.
[1:43:05] Now they're asking for it again. But
[1:43:07] under the seventh seal, we see the open
[1:43:09] book come down from heaven. A mighty
[1:43:12] angel descends with the cloud.
[1:43:15] Amen. And an open book in his hand. This
[1:43:18] is the meat that does not perish. THIS
[1:43:21] IS THE UNFAILING BODY WORD OF THE SON OF
[1:43:23] MAN. AND REVELATIONS 10:8 SAYS WHAT?
[1:43:27] Take the book and eat.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Eat the book and prophesy. This is the
[1:43:36] unfailing body word of the son of man.
[1:43:38] If you take everything in John chapter
[1:43:40] 6, it is an absolute indictment of this
[1:43:44] generation. Even those in the message
[1:43:46] who will not go further with the word
[1:43:49] and who do not recognize this coming.
[1:43:52] Lastly,
[1:43:54] spiritual food in due season. It is he
[1:43:57] says it is not. He's speaking of the
[1:43:58] sirenian women. It is not me to take the
[1:44:01] children's bread and give it to dogs.
[1:44:02] Didn't Jesus say the same thing to the
[1:44:04] sirenian woman? He was sent to his own.
[1:44:06] That is right. That's who it who he
[1:44:09] come. He never went to the to the
[1:44:10] Gentiles.
[1:44:12] Now today he visits the Gentiles in
[1:44:14] their time. It's not meat. You say why
[1:44:17] is
[1:44:19] it's not meat. You say why is the
[1:44:21] message don't go out in these great big
[1:44:23] places these big crusades like among the
[1:44:25] denomination.
[1:44:27] Are you ready for it?
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; It's not their food.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; It's not the church so-called food.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; It's the bride food.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; It's spiritual food in season. IT WOULD
[1:44:39] MAKE THEM SICK AT THEIR STOMACH. It's
[1:44:42] too rich for them. See, you you can't do
[1:44:46] it. But for the children, it's bread.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; It's life. It's Jesus Christ the same
[1:44:52] yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; It's bread.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; If you thought you didn't know the name
[1:44:58] bread of God, you had a prophet in this
[1:45:01] day who said to you, "This food that is
[1:45:03] bride food, it is bread for the
[1:45:06] children. THIS IS CHILDREN'S BREAD. THIS
[1:45:09] IS THE BREAD THAT came down FROM HEAVEN.
[1:45:11] THIS IS THE FLESH OF THE SON OF MAN THAT
[1:45:13] WE ARE EATING. THIS IS THE LIFE OF HIS
[1:45:15] OWN BODY THAT HE GIVES FOR US TO EAT.
[1:45:17] HIS BLOOD TO DRINK. His life to take in
[1:45:20] for us. Glory be to God.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. This food cannot be digested by
[1:45:25] people who want to remain in Pentecost
[1:45:27] and searching for signs. They could only
[1:45:30] preach using buzzwords. Seven thunders,
[1:45:33] seven seal, SEVEN THIS, SEVENTH THAT,
[1:45:36] THIRD POLE. JUST BUZZWORDS AND BUZZWORDS
[1:45:38] AND NO REVELATION BEHIND IT BECAUSE
[1:45:40] THEY'RE NOT FEEDING ON THE BODY word of
[1:45:42] the son of man.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; THEY JUST WANT SIGNS. THEY WANT TO USE
[1:45:46] THE BUZZWORDS to create anointing to see
[1:45:48] signs.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; But when you give IT TO THEM, WHEN YOU
[1:45:53] TELL THEM THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS, THIS IS
[1:45:56] WHAT IT MEANS. THIS IS WHAT IT IS. They
[1:45:58] can't digest it. THEY GET ANGRY. THEY
[1:46:01] STILL WANT SENSATIONS and signs from
[1:46:03] heaven. This is bright food, saints. It
[1:46:06] is the bread of life. The bread had that
[1:46:08] come down FROM HEAVEN. THE NAME JESUS
[1:46:10] CHRIST REVEALED TO US IN A MORE PERSONAL
[1:46:13] WAY the bread of God.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; So what do you have TO DO? WHAT IS YOUR
[1:46:18] JOB TODAY? Young people, older people
[1:46:21] who if you if you're growing cold, what
[1:46:23] is the job today? Right? 1 Corinthians
[1:46:25] 5:7 to8. Purge out therefore the old
[1:46:29] leaven that you may be a new lump as you
[1:46:33] are unleavened. FOR EVEN CHRIST OUR
[1:46:36] PASSOVER IS SACRIFICED FOR US.
[1:46:37] THEREFORE, LET US KEEP THE FEAST, NOT
[1:46:40] WITH OLD LEAVEN, NEITHER with leaven of
[1:46:42] malice and wickedness, but with the
[1:46:44] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
[1:46:47] Take the lamb of Christ. KEEP THE
[1:46:50] PASSOVER FEAST WITH UNLEAVENED BREAD.
[1:46:53] You can't take the lamb with LEAVEN
[1:46:55] BREAD.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; IT'S AGAINST THE LAW.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THE LAMB WITH
[1:47:00] UNLEAVENED BREAD.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; That's what you got to do. SO, WHAT IS
[1:47:03] THAT? WHAT IS 11 OF THE PHARISEES?
[1:47:05] ORGANIZED RELIGION.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; If you want to to to receive this bread,
[1:47:10] YOU'VE GOT TO KICK OUT ALL OF ORGANIZED
[1:47:12] RELIGION. Take the lamb first with
[1:47:15] unleavened bread and then you receive
[1:47:17] the son of man, the meat which does not
[1:47:19] perish. That's what you've got to do.
[1:47:22] Get rid of leodyianism, Pentecostalism.
[1:47:25] Do not seek and run after signs and the
[1:47:27] meat which perishes. Listen, every
[1:47:29] single sign that is given becomes
[1:47:32] corrupted. Yes,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; I don't care. Let's say you got a heal
[1:47:35] of some great healing.
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Eventually over time after telling that
[1:47:39] story a 100 times the story is
[1:47:41] corrupted.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; It's never the same. More is added TO
[1:47:45] IT. MORE DETAILS are given. Suddenly you
[1:47:48] become someone spiritual that people
[1:47:51] need to come to advice just because you
[1:47:52] were healed.
[1:47:57] That's what happens with signs. Look at
[1:48:00] the true sign overlooked. What is the
[1:48:03] true sign overlooked? The word made
[1:48:05] flesh. The book that has come down to
[1:48:08] earth again. The body word of the son of
[1:48:09] man sent here for one purpose. What is
[1:48:12] the message? WHAT IS THIS MESSAGE WHICH
[1:48:14] came down from heaven with the the the
[1:48:17] body word of the son of man? What is its
[1:48:19] purpose? One purpose to make you him.
[1:48:25] Yeah,
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; there's a scripture that tells you that.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; It's you don't even you don't even need
[1:48:33] to interpret it. It's so blatant. And
[1:48:36] we'll close with this.
[1:48:39] For we being many are one bread.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; What is bread? Bread is for others to
[1:48:47] eat
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; and one body. For we ARE ALL PARTAKERS
[1:48:53] OF THAT ONE BREAD.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; So the whole point of Christianity
[1:48:59] salvation
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; is that by you feeding on him, you
[1:49:03] become him that others may feed on.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF IT.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE NEED to receive the son of man
[1:49:10] ministry right now? Because if we become
[1:49:13] him, others can feed on that which we
[1:49:16] can give them.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. We being many become one bread
[1:49:20] because we feed on that one bread.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God, saints.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Let us stand together. Praise be to his
[1:49:28] precious name.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. Don't you love him,
[1:49:32] saints?
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. I want you to see that
[1:49:36] partaking of this one bread, the bread
[1:49:38] of God came down from heaven.
