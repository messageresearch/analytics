[0:00] Praise the Lord. Let's as we're standing
[0:03] turn in our Bibles or you can follow on
[0:06] the screen
[0:07] and we're going to
[0:11] uh read a small portion of scripture
[0:14] from Ephesians chapter 1 and verse 10.
[0:18] And it says that in the dispensation of
[0:21] the fullness of times, he might gather
[0:24] together in one all things in Christ,
[0:28] both which are in heaven and which are
[0:31] in earth, even in him. Amen. The Lord
[0:35] add a blessing to his word. You may be
[0:37] seated. So, we appreciate the Lord this
[0:40] morning and we're certainly thankful for
[0:42] his grace and mercy
[0:45] with us. And so, um, we trust that the
[0:48] Lord will bless us this morning with the
[0:50] word. And I'm hoping this is going to be
[0:53] the, uh, closing of the series, this
[0:56] short little series which started with
[0:59] the Sunday school, the story of God and
[1:01] man. And this is part six. It always
[1:04] sounds strange when you end on a part
[1:05] six but um so to today our
[1:10] [clears throat] our title or subject
[1:12] rather gathering together in one all
[1:14] things in Christ and for a title heaven
[1:17] and earth embracing.
[1:20] Amen.
[1:22] So, uh, I just want to say it's been a
[1:24] real beautiful, um, portion of the word
[1:29] that we've been looking at for the last
[1:30] part of the series. And it's been really
[1:33] also, uh, quite nicely tying up with the
[1:37] uh, uh, the series that we just started
[1:40] in Newcastle on on um, the stature of a
[1:44] perfect man. So, I'm trusting that the
[1:45] Lord will lead us further and further.
[1:48] And I also because of the last time we
[1:51] were here and we spoke on truth. I had
[1:53] some inspiration to also uh speak a
[1:57] little bit on that because of what we
[1:58] started with the Sunday school and
[2:00] because there's not enough time till the
[2:02] ending of the year and um till the the
[2:06] closing of uh uh services of the year.
[2:09] So I just want to probably um speak a
[2:13] little bit about truth. Maybe the next
[2:14] time we we come together, I'll just see
[2:17] how the Lord leads us. Who knows? There
[2:18] might be a part seven. I don't know. So,
[2:21] but this series, a lot of this series,
[2:24] some of you would remember,
[2:27] is taken from our
[2:29] I don't know how many parts we did in
[2:31] the adoption series in 2015 and also
[2:33] before that. A lot of things, a lot of
[2:36] statements, a lot of uh quotes,
[2:38] scriptures and and uh some of the
[2:40] teaching in there is from there. So,
[2:43] some of you can go back and there's far
[2:45] more detail in the uh series there on
[2:49] adoption, a gene of your father,
[2:51] predestination, so much that we put in
[2:54] there. I really I think we must have
[2:56] done that one over two years or so. So,
[2:59] we're thankful to God anyway that he can
[3:01] lead us this way. So I'm also thankful
[3:04] to brother Liam for last week and
[3:09] give him one week to preach and he lose
[3:11] his voice you know
[3:13] [laughter]
[3:15] so need to do it more often but I know
[3:18] we're thankful for that and uh I'm I'm
[3:21] very grateful to the Lord for the
[3:23] ministry in our church and the brothers
[3:26] and I like the way that we all look at
[3:29] things differently and and it's so
[3:32] wonderful It's it's amazing that we even
[3:34] the brothers on the fellowship group who
[3:37] put on the devotions and just the way
[3:39] you see things is so refreshing. So I
[3:42] just appreciate the gifts that God gives
[3:45] to his sons. Amen.
[3:47] So um I'm you know looking at the
[3:51] scripture the dispensation of the
[3:53] fullness of times he might gather
[3:56] together in one all things in Christ
[3:58] both which are in heaven and which are
[4:00] in earth even in him. So this scripture
[4:05] is loaded with revelation. Just one
[4:09] little verse is so loaded with
[4:12] revelation. So I want to draw your
[4:13] attention to five things that are in
[4:17] there. Number one, and this is what
[4:19] we're going to break down this morning.
[4:21] The dispensation of the fullness of
[4:23] times.
[4:25] Look at how specific it is. There's so
[4:28] much to understand there. There's
[4:30] firstly there's dispensation, then
[4:32] there's fullness, and then it says of
[4:34] times.
[4:36] You can just read over that and wonder
[4:38] what does this mean and make up your own
[4:40] story about it. But the prophet gives us
[4:44] guidance. The Bible gives us guidance.
[4:47] Amen. Then there it says, "Gathering or
[4:51] gathered together in one all things in
[4:55] Christ." Right? But then it gets even
[4:58] more specific. It says, "Which are in
[5:00] heaven."
[5:01] In other words, it's telling us there
[5:03] are things that are in Christ which are
[5:05] in heaven. And then there are things
[5:07] which are in earth which are in Christ.
[5:10] So there are things that are in Christ
[5:12] that are in heaven and there are things
[5:13] that are in Christ which are in earth
[5:15] and in the dispensation of the fullness
[5:17] of time he's going to gather all that
[5:18] together in one right. Uh and lastly it
[5:23] says which are in him. I don't know why
[5:27] that's not there we go even in him. So
[5:31] you got it. You break that whole
[5:33] scripture down into five parts. There's
[5:35] a dispensation of the fullness of times.
[5:37] And we got to ask ourselves, when's
[5:39] that? When is that dispensation? Is that
[5:43] the millennium? Is that the new heaven
[5:45] and new earth?
[5:47] Has it passed? Is it now? And then
[5:51] gathered together in one all things in
[5:54] Christ. What does that mean? Things
[5:57] which are in heaven, things which are in
[5:58] earth, even in him. Praise be to God.
[6:04] So the dispensation of the fullness of
[6:07] times I'll just say it is this age.
[6:12] &gt;&gt; It is the bride age and we're going to
[6:15] show you that through the teaching. It
[6:17] is the age of adoption.
[6:20] So if you read all the verse now it's
[6:23] not the Leodysian age.
[6:26] [clears throat]
[6:26] &gt;&gt; That's certainly not the age of
[6:28] adoption.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. The Leodysian age is certainly not
[6:31] the the the dispensation of the fullness
[6:33] of times. We have to put that up into
[6:37] the the the ages and dispensations to
[6:40] show it to you. So if you read um excuse
[6:44] me from the rest of the verses from
[6:47] Ephesians 1 verse 3-9. So we read verse
[6:50] 10. If you read from verse 3 to9, uh you
[6:54] know how that's the whole adoption
[6:56] scripture, uh it basically says, I'm not
[7:00] going to read the whole thing. I'm going
[7:01] to paraphrase it for you. You will see
[7:04] that it says God having chosen us.
[7:08] Remember it says in him
[7:11] according to the purpose of his own will
[7:13] and so on. You remember that having
[7:15] chosen us in him. All right, Sunday
[7:18] school people who in the logos
[7:22] having selected us having elected us
[7:24] having chosen us in the logos remember
[7:28] let's go back to part one before the
[7:30] foundation of the world by fornowledge
[7:34] saw that we would come into being
[7:38] on earth and then he predestinated us
[7:42] unto good works in Christ and determined
[7:46] ed it that we should receive the
[7:49] revelation of his will. These are all
[7:52] from verse 3 to verse 9. Uh that one day
[7:56] he would gather together all things in
[7:59] Christ, things that are which in heaven,
[8:02] theophony, things on earth,
[8:05] predestinated fleshly bodies, and gather
[8:08] them all together in one, which we call
[8:11] the rapture.
[8:14] Yeah.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; In him [snorts] who is the word in him
[8:18] who it all started with the logos king
[8:21] theophony. Do you get the picture?
[8:24] That's what Ephesians 3 to9 and and
[8:28] verse 10 is actually telling us. It's
[8:30] telling us the story of man and God. God
[8:33] and man. So we want to begin with the
[8:36] dispensation of times. Now the word
[8:40] dispensation
[8:42] is a very peculiar word and not very
[8:45] easy to understand. In fact a lot of
[8:48] people today do not use the word
[8:49] dispensation. You know you you don't
[8:52] find you meet a colleague at work and
[8:54] says you know how you doing? Oh, well,
[8:57] you know, I'm in the dispensation of
[8:59] having toddlers
[9:02] or, you know, I'm in the dispensation of
[9:05] uh being engaged or I'm in the
[9:07] dispensation of, you know, pot-bellied
[9:11] father,
[9:13] middle-aged, you know, nobody talks like
[9:15] that. Dispensation is like an ancient
[9:17] word now to people. Uh, in fact, we
[9:20] don't even use the word age anymore. You
[9:23] know, I'm in that age. In fact, today we
[9:25] use the word phase. You know, he's going
[9:28] through a phase. I'm going through a
[9:30] phase. You know, it'll phase out someday
[9:33] and then another one will phase in
[9:35] maybe. I don't know. But that's kind of
[9:37] like what it is where people talk about
[9:40] it today. But it comes from different
[9:43] meanings. Dispensation comes from
[9:44] different thoughts and expresses many
[9:47] different things. One part of the
[9:49] meaning comes from the idea of
[9:53] dispensing.
[9:55] Dispensation.
[9:57] Dispensing. So dispensing. If you
[10:00] imagine like you have a a big jug of
[10:02] water, like a 5 L jug of water, and then
[10:04] you have a one liter bottle and maybe a
[10:07] half a liter bottle and then a few
[10:09] glasses or or tumblers, whatever you
[10:12] call them at your place. And then you
[10:13] take this 5 L jug and you start pouring
[10:16] water into the one liter. and then the
[10:18] half a liter and the tumblers, right?
[10:20] What are you doing? You're dispensing.
[10:23] You're pouring out of the main source
[10:26] into others, right? That's one of the
[10:30] meanings. The another part of the of the
[10:33] meaning of dispensation is a period of
[10:36] time.
[10:38] Okay? Another part of the meaning comes
[10:40] from the meaning of a system of ruling,
[10:43] a system of governing, a system of
[10:46] revealing.
[10:49] So when YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER,
[10:51] pouring out
[10:53] period of time, a system of governance,
[10:56] you have to put it all together because
[10:58] that's where you're going to understand
[10:59] it. What we what we find is in a period
[11:03] of time, God pours out of himself, God
[11:07] reveals a part of himself by the word in
[11:11] a particular way, and that particular
[11:14] way governs that time.
[11:17] Right? You so you couldn't say that in
[11:20] the time of Moses
[11:23] they were governing by the revelation of
[11:25] Jesus Christ. They were not. It was a
[11:29] different age, a different time period.
[11:31] And the governance there according to
[11:33] God was very different to the time of
[11:36] Christ. It was a different governance to
[11:39] the church. In the same way here we are
[11:42] now in the church. We are not being
[11:44] governed like it was in the time of
[11:46] Moses.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Yet it's the same God.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Brother Bam teaches us that
[11:54] there were many different dispensations
[11:57] since Adam. But there were three major
[12:01] dispensations and the most significant
[12:04] dispensations of time in our past are
[12:06] those three. They'll those those so
[12:09] three major dispensations and and under
[12:12] those were broken up the smaller
[12:14] dispensations or what we call ages right
[12:18] so um of course there is one more major
[12:22] dispensation to come after this uh um
[12:27] but let's have a look at what we have
[12:29] today let's go to spiritual um adoption
[12:33] as we look into this dispensation of
[12:35] time Um,
[12:38] did I miss something? Okay, there we go.
[12:41] Now, are you still with me?
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Now, three is the number of perfection
[12:47] and that is uh that God is perfected,
[12:50] the one true eternal God is perfected in
[12:54] three dispensations of his Godhead
[12:56] manifestation. Three dispensations,
[12:59] THREE DISPENSATIONS of himself.
[13:02] So God, the self-existing one, remember
[13:06] that one,
[13:08] right? The fountain of seven colors, the
[13:11] spirit who existed, the I am. Right.
[13:15] Right. So there's three dispensations
[13:18] he's going to bring upon man. And that's
[13:21] father, son, and holy ghost. Now when
[13:24] you when you look at it like that,
[13:25] immediately this is not a godhead
[13:27] problem.
[13:28] This is not about godhead. This is about
[13:31] God manifesting himself. So he's pouring
[13:35] himself out as father over a period of
[13:38] time and governing him his people by
[13:41] that. THEN HE POURS HIMSELF OUT AS SON.
[13:45] He dispenses himself out as son and
[13:48] governs by that over a period of time.
[13:51] And then there is holy ghost. Holy
[13:52] spirit. Is that right?
[13:55] Doesn't mean there is I'm reading now.
[13:58] doesn't mean there is three different
[14:00] individual gods but there is one God
[14:03] represented in three not three people
[14:07] not three persons not three
[14:09] personalities three dispensations
[14:12] &gt;&gt; yes amen
[14:15] &gt;&gt; God is not three God is one but three
[14:18] manifestations of his godhead
[14:22] &gt;&gt; or godhood
[14:24] &gt;&gt; was the original word godhood what is
[14:27] godhood good being God,
[14:30] right? A whole lot of uh uh like for
[14:33] example, I explained this to you in in
[14:35] the message I preached to you uh I in
[14:37] you, you in me when we spoke on the
[14:40] godhead um and we showed you the the
[14:42] original word was godhood, right? And uh
[14:46] it how do we understand this? For
[14:48] example, what is neighborhood?
[14:51] You can't be one person living in an
[14:54] area and call yourself a neighborhood.
[14:57] You have to have neighbors
[14:59] &gt;&gt; to have a neighborhood. You can't be one
[15:02] person and call yourself a brotherhood.
[15:04] You've got to have brothers to have a
[15:06] brotherhood. Are we together?
[15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; So what is godhood?
[15:12] What is Godhead?
[15:14] It is the parts that make him go to us.
[15:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So for example under the father or
[15:22] under Jehovah what was the godhood or
[15:26] the godhead in the time of Moses? The
[15:28] godhead comprised of Moses the prophet
[15:33] Aaron the high priest the intercessor
[15:36] and the most holy
[15:38] &gt;&gt; with the ark of the covenant. That was
[15:40] WHAT IT THE PARTS THAT made him go to
[15:44] the people.
[15:46] They could NOT HEAR HIS WORD EXCEPT
[15:47] THROUGH MOSES.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; YES. They could not find salvation
[15:50] except through the intercessor taking
[15:52] the blood into the holiest of holies.
[15:54] That was God to them.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; Moses, Aaron, and the shikina of glory.
[16:00] That was the Godhead in Moses time.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; So when people argue about father, son,
[16:05] and holy ghost, all they're arguing and
[16:07] fussing about is theology.
[16:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. [clears throat]
[16:10] &gt;&gt; They don't understand what godhead
[16:12] really means. When it comes in Galatians
[16:14] and it says in him dwell the fullness of
[16:16] the godhead bodily, IT'S TELLING YOU ALL
[16:19] THE PARTS
[16:21] &gt;&gt; are in him.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; HEBREWS TELLS US THAT HE'S the
[16:24] tabernacle. He is the mercy seat. He's
[16:26] the sacrifice. He's the high priest.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; He's the law. HE'S EVERYTHING.
[16:31] EVERYTHING ELSE WAS a shadow of him.
[16:34] &gt;&gt; So in him dwells the FULLNESS OF THE
[16:36] GODHEAD. AND HERE we have people
[16:38] fussing. That means father, son, holy
[16:40] ghost is in him. No, there's so much
[16:42] more to it.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; ALL THE PARTS that make God God to us
[16:46] dwelt in Christ.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; Praise be to his name.
[16:52] But there are three manifestations of
[16:55] his Godhead.
[16:57] Now if you if you doubt what I told you,
[17:00] three manifestations of his godhead,
[17:02] meaning
[17:04] three dispensations of time on earth
[17:08] perfects the one true and living God.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; So he's not talking about three persons.
[17:14] He says three manifestations of his
[17:16] godhead means three dispensations of
[17:20] time.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. where God would reveal himself to
[17:23] his people in three different
[17:26] manifestations
[17:30] of time. Are we together? All right. So,
[17:33] people,
[17:35] for those of you listening today and
[17:37] those of you online,
[17:39] there's a lot I'm going to tell you. And
[17:42] some of you,
[17:44] hopefully not here this morning, will
[17:46] feel the compulsion to say that I'm
[17:48] making things up. I assure you I'm not.
[17:51] I got a lot of that this year, by the
[17:53] way. A lot of people telling me I'm
[17:55] making things up.
[17:57] I just don't understand. I mean, to me,
[17:59] you can you can take quotes and
[18:01] scriptures and you can just talk about
[18:02] it and fuss about it over the surface
[18:04] level, but how about studying it?
[18:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; You know, really getting into it. Like I
[18:10] hear this fuss about, you know, the name
[18:12] of Jesus. We the new name of God, Mrs.
[18:15] Jesus. We are Mrs. Jesus. You should
[18:18] really sit down and think about whether
[18:20] you want to be called that.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; What?
[18:23] &gt;&gt; We have a jubilee about being called
[18:25] Mrs. Jesus.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Do you know what the meaning of Jesus
[18:28] is?
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Jehovah's Savior.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; You really want to take that name
[18:34] &gt;&gt; and claim it and shout and make songs
[18:36] about it and read quotes and have a
[18:38] hallelujah whatever time to take that
[18:42] name
[18:43] means you are Jehovah's Savior. Yeah,
[18:46] &gt;&gt; you are saying I'm Mrs. Jehovah savior
[18:49] and then your life doesn't even behave
[18:51] like savior.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; You're not an intercessor for people.
[18:55] You don't give to the poor. You don't
[18:58] take care of the he the needy. You don't
[19:00] go uh proclaim healing upon the sick,
[19:02] but you want the name. Why? Because in
[19:06] theory, Mrs. Jesus.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; This is the problem I have with
[19:09] legalists
[19:11] because you only fuss about the quotes
[19:13] and you want to be direct about the
[19:15] quotes. But how about teaching it? How
[19:17] about getting it under the surface
[19:19] level? How about getting to what it
[19:21] really means? Get it to convict people's
[19:23] lives and make them think about it.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, Mrs. Jesus becomes a
[19:29] blasphemous name.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; Go read that message. Blasphemous names.
[19:35] you'll have a real wakeup call.
[19:38] So, I'm not making things up.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to take my word for
[19:42] it. You don't even have to trust me. I
[19:44] know a lot of people say, "Trust me."
[19:47] It's such a strange statement we get
[19:48] used to. Trust me. No, don't trust me.
[19:51] Go read for yourself. Go study it.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; Go and don't just read a quote and read
[19:57] scriptures and say in a legalistic way,
[20:00] I stay with what the tape says. Go look
[20:03] under the surface. go to the depths of
[20:06] it and check it for yourself. So I can
[20:09] tell you from years and years of
[20:11] studying and combing through the the
[20:13] message, I am confident in telling you
[20:16] everything I'm going to tell you today
[20:18] is from the message and the Bible. And
[20:21] it is the word himself being made known
[20:23] to us today. All right. So three
[20:26] dispensations of time. You know, I
[20:30] figure
[20:32] I I don't care anymore. Uh people are
[20:35] going to criticize me no matter what I
[20:37] say. Putting myself on the internet, you
[20:41] know. Well, not me. The judge putting me
[20:43] on the internet, put a target on my back
[20:45] and my forehead and everywhere else, you
[20:48] know. So, I'm I'm okay with that. It's
[20:50] whatever we're going to say, we're going
[20:51] to be judged for it. I just believe the
[20:53] word has to get out to the world. And
[20:55] however it goes in this fourth
[20:58] dimension, so be it. If they if I'm even
[21:02] shot from behind by my own brothers,
[21:05] it's okay, right? Uh and and those who
[21:08] claim to be a part of us, it's fine. We
[21:11] got to let this word go. We got to let
[21:14] it go out to the people and let them
[21:16] argue, let them fuss, let them question,
[21:18] let them search, let them look deeper.
[21:21] That's all. And we'll get some things
[21:23] right. We'll get some things not so
[21:25] right. We might even get some things
[21:26] wrong. And then God will correct us on
[21:28] that.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; But we're not afraid because he told us,
[21:32] "PUT YOUR FOOT IN JORDAN."
[21:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; STEP IN.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And that's what I'm going to do.
[21:38] Go make footprints on your promises. I'm
[21:40] &gt;&gt; not going to stand back and say, "No,
[21:42] I'm I'm going to wait for what the
[21:43] prophet told me.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; The prophet told me, go make footprints.
[21:48] &gt;&gt; You have not walked this way before.
[21:50] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to do."
[21:52] So, I'm not just going to fight about
[21:55] godhead doctrine and whether it's
[21:57] trinity or oneness. I left that
[22:01] 20 years ago, long time ago. I'm done
[22:04] with that. I'm not even arguing that.
[22:05] It's not even a question in my mind
[22:07] anymore. I WANT TO KNOW WHERE I FIT in
[22:09] into the Godhead.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I believe that I do.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's what the message
[22:16] came to reveal to us.
[22:18] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's go to the
[22:20] dispensation of the father.
[22:23] Okay. So here's a diagram that I drew
[22:26] for you many many years ago, right? And
[22:29] uh at first it was not even in color. It
[22:31] was just black and white. And I must say
[22:34] I cannot take uh um any praise for this
[22:38] diagram. This is a diagram I grew up
[22:41] with from preachers who came before me.
[22:44] uh I just improved on some of the things
[22:46] and you know but these are what my
[22:50] teachers taught me while I was growing
[22:52] up. So yeah so I don't take any uh
[22:55] accolades for uh you know if it's not
[22:58] something that I've done. All right so
[23:01] looking at the diagram the title there
[23:03] is the dispensations of time. Okay. And
[23:07] basically taking it as each segment of a
[23:10] thousand years as one day. So, we're up
[23:14] to 6,000 years now. Uh, we're past 6,000
[23:18] years and we're already into the next
[23:19] thousand. Okay,
[23:22] everyone agree?
[23:24] &gt;&gt; All right. So, now if you look at the
[23:27] bottom of the diagram, I've got these
[23:31] larger arcs which show us the
[23:34] dispensation. The first one, you'll see
[23:36] the dispensation of father spanned 4,000
[23:40] years. Can you see that? And then, well,
[23:45] this is not going to work. Okay. Oh, I
[23:48] should have had a long stick.
[23:49] [clears throat]
[23:50] Uh, and then the dispensation of sun.
[23:53] So, let's explain it for those who can't
[23:55] see it cuz I know everyone over 50, I'm
[23:57] getting there, you know, if you don't
[23:59] have uh your thick glasses on today,
[24:01] you're not reading. But let's have a
[24:03] look. So, from Adam, let's say it that
[24:05] way. From Adam to Noah was a thousand
[24:07] years. Noah to Abram a thousand years.
[24:10] Abram to Solomon a thousand years.
[24:11] Solomon to Christ a thousand. So from
[24:13] Adam to Christ 4,000 years, right? From
[24:17] Christ, son of man to this time is
[24:22] another 2,000 years, right? And that's
[24:24] the dispensation of the sun. There's no
[24:28] mystery about that because that's when
[24:30] Jesus came 2,000 years ago and that's
[24:33] when God became known as Jesus.
[24:37] That was a dispensation of the son. And
[24:40] then of course we are now in this this
[24:43] dispensation of the bride. All right. So
[24:46] let's go through it step by step. Let's
[24:49] break it down.
[24:52] The dispensation of the father. This
[24:55] begins with God above us. Why? Because
[24:59] for for 4,000 years God is invisible.
[25:03] God comes as a appears as all kinds of
[25:06] things. A pillar of fire, pillar of
[25:08] cloud. And he uses all kinds of things
[25:10] to veil himself,
[25:13] right? And then even if he appears as an
[25:16] angel, he never appears as the same
[25:18] looking angel. And every because every
[25:20] time he appears, they ask him, "What's
[25:22] your name?" He says, "My name is a
[25:23] secret." And then, of course, he tells
[25:26] him, "His name is Jehovah." And then
[25:28] later on, Samson Samson's father asks
[25:31] him, "What's your name?" came and he
[25:32] says my name is a secret.
[25:36] Are you with us? So was he Jehovah or
[25:38] not? You get what I'm saying? So he
[25:42] keeps appearing in forms but never
[25:46] claiming a form as that's my form. He
[25:50] told them do not make any form or image.
[25:52] No male, no female, no bird, no fish, no
[25:54] no beast, nor anything, no creeping
[25:56] thing. All you heard was a voice. Is
[26:00] that right? God above us. Now the time
[26:04] period, this first time period from the
[26:07] age of conscience, can you see that big
[26:08] yellow arrow?
[26:10] The age of conscience. What does that
[26:12] mean? From Adam to Abraham, there was no
[26:16] scripture, no church, no form of
[26:20] worship, no uh uh altar that God
[26:25] ordained,
[26:27] no songs,
[26:29] no prophets,
[26:31] no holy men walking around preaching.
[26:34] There was no form of prayer.
[26:38] So for 2,000 years, they had no church.
[26:42] How do they serve God? By conscience.
[26:46] By doing good works. By following
[26:49] originally what Adam had passed down to
[26:51] all his sons.
[26:54] Conscience. Age of conscience. [snorts]
[26:57] Right? And and that's uh under that we
[27:00] found two covenants. Now watch this.
[27:02] Under each age there are covenants. Now
[27:05] what is a covenant? It's a promise God
[27:08] makes with man or a like a deal,
[27:12] right? Like a contract God makes with
[27:15] man. He made the first covenant with
[27:17] Adam, the Adamic covenant. The next one
[27:20] with Noah, which we call the Noahic
[27:22] covenant. This is not something we made
[27:24] up. This is something that is they teach
[27:26] in uh schools of theology and they and
[27:30] the prophet used the same words as well.
[27:32] Are you still with me?
[27:34] Okay. So under this dispensation, the
[27:38] two major covenants God made with man
[27:40] was the Adamic and the Noah covenant.
[27:43] And this dispensation lasts 2,000 years.
[27:47] And the promises of these covenants, now
[27:49] watch, THE PROMISES OF THESE covenants
[27:52] were not met,
[27:55] were not fulfilled in the days that they
[27:58] were given
[27:59] because man always failed.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. the covenants WERE NOT RECEIVED BY
[28:07] THOSE men because man failed to come to
[28:10] maturity under those dispensations.
[28:14] So in other words, with every covenant
[28:16] that is made, it never comes to
[28:19] fulfillment.
[28:21] But God keeps his covenants.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; So if man failed and the covenant was
[28:26] not fulfilled, there's got to be a time
[28:29] when all those covenants are fulfilled.
[28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:33] &gt;&gt; All right. So that proved and and what
[28:36] does this prove? It proves to us that
[28:38] try as you might, you cannot serve God
[28:41] with a conscience.
[28:43] Your conscience is going to fail you. We
[28:45] have 2,000 years of proof.
[28:48] [gasps]
[28:49] Right? That you can't you you can say,
[28:51] "Brother Al, I'm a good guy. I'm a good
[28:54] person. I give to charity. I feed the
[28:56] poor. I um you know, I forgive
[28:59] everybody. And uh I'm not jealous. and I
[29:03] don't get angry. I'm I've got my
[29:05] temperance and my patience and I come to
[29:08] church. I'm a good person. Or I don't
[29:10] come to church. Um I'm I'm just a good
[29:12] person. I don't need God. I don't need
[29:14] the open book. I don't need the
[29:15] five-fold ministry. I don't need
[29:17] anything. I I am a good person and I if
[29:20] there's ever a heaven, I deserve to go
[29:22] there. That's your problem.
[29:25] Cuz there's no man that deserves
[29:27] anything there. The Bible even tells us
[29:30] there is no one good but God. Amen. All
[29:34] right. So let's move on. So this proves
[29:37] to us that man could not attain harmony
[29:41] or oneness with God by serving God out
[29:44] of a good conscience. Now what is this?
[29:46] This is the closing of the story of God
[29:49] and man. It's bringing everything back
[29:50] together in just a different
[29:53] understanding. Right? So after that we
[29:56] have the age of law. That's that red
[29:58] one. It's a good color for the age of
[30:01] law. Um, and under that, God makes a
[30:04] covenant with Abraham.
[30:06] Mosaic covenant, that is a covenant with
[30:09] Moses, and the Davidic covenant, which
[30:11] is the covenant he made with David. And
[30:14] here's THE AMAZING THING. ALL those
[30:16] covenants were not met.
[30:19] God kept some things, but man kept
[30:22] failing. MAN KEPT DOING OTHER things
[30:25] that caused the covenant to be
[30:27] continued.
[30:29] Is that right? God's covenant with
[30:32] Abram. Abram didn't live to see it. He
[30:34] got the promised son, but didn't live to
[30:37] see his seed multiplied as the stars. He
[30:40] didn't live to see the land being taken
[30:42] by his seed.
[30:45] Amen. With David, he told David, I will
[30:48] establish your throne forever. There was
[30:51] promise of a son of David.
[30:54] And everyone thought it was Solomon. And
[30:55] then Solomon failed and married like a
[30:58] thousand women.
[31:00] Man was crazy.
[31:04] SO IT OBVIOUSLY NEVER MET. That's why
[31:06] the Jews knew there is a son of David
[31:09] still to come
[31:12] and that they believe that the Messiah
[31:14] would come and reestablish David's
[31:16] throne on earth. THE DAVIDIC COVENANT
[31:19] STILL HAS A PROMISE OUTSTANDING.
[31:22] Are you with us?
[31:24] All right. So, we all got that. And the
[31:27] amazing part of it, something I really
[31:29] didn't want to speak about, but when you
[31:31] look at this, why is it called father?
[31:34] Because father has children. In other
[31:37] words, the relationship with God is
[31:39] about father and children.
[31:42] And what's the relationship between a
[31:44] father and a child? It's instruction.
[31:48] It's law. So when you look at this why
[31:51] it ties so much into stature of a
[31:52] perfect man because as a father he
[31:55] starts there with Adam and Noah and
[31:56] Abraham they're like toddlers conscience
[32:00] right you can't give them law from the
[32:03] very beginning but then they start
[32:05] growing and then in Moses the law comes
[32:07] in and now he's dealing with like
[32:09] teenagers are you with me thou shalt not
[32:13] thou shalt now I'm giving you knowledge
[32:14] I'm giving you law I'm giving you uh um
[32:18] uh a form of worship. I'm giving you
[32:20] covenants. I'm giving you the blood of
[32:22] sacrifice. I'm giving you all these uh
[32:24] the priesthood. Now, you're dealing with
[32:26] them as teenagers, but every once in a
[32:29] while, they got to get a whipping.
[32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God couldn't remain or ever have
[32:37] an intimate relationship with man by
[32:40] remaining as father.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So the dispensation
[32:47] comes to an end. Nobody's saying father
[32:50] comes to an end. We're saying the
[32:52] dispensation of father comes to an end.
[32:56] Right? And then comes the son of man who
[32:58] DOES WHAT? HE SAYS I CAME TO DECLARE THE
[33:01] FATHER.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; He even says if you've seen me you've
[33:05] seen the father.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Right? So the next dispensation we have
[33:09] now before we get the the next major
[33:12] dispensation there's a short small
[33:15] dispensation that pops in. It's a
[33:18] dispensation of the son of man and it's
[33:20] a mysterious dispensation.
[33:23] Why? This is God with us.
[33:28] Remember what was dispensation of
[33:30] father? God above us. God invisible. God
[33:35] you could not touch. God you could not
[33:37] speak to. You had to speak to the high
[33:39] priest or speak to the prophet and the
[33:41] prophet would go in and speak with God
[33:43] behind the veil. You could not you could
[33:46] not touch him. You could not see him.
[33:48] You could not make any form. You could
[33:50] not pray by yourself.
[33:53] You had to pray through someone.
[33:57] Do you remember Hannah standing in the
[33:59] temple and she's standing there praying
[34:01] and Eli comes up and says, "Are you
[34:03] crazy? Are you drunk? Well, then you
[34:06] have to be drunk for you to be doing
[34:08] this. You're not allowed to do this. You
[34:11] are supposed to come and confess your
[34:13] issue here and we will take your prayers
[34:15] before God.
[34:20] But now God with us, Emmanuel, we
[34:25] touched him
[34:26] without controversy. God was manifested
[34:29] in the flesh. Is this right? God with
[34:32] us. HE BECAME FLESH. SO AND AND this is
[34:35] a very very short dispensation. This
[34:38] dispensation involved the coming the
[34:41] first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[34:43] and it spanned 33 and a half years short
[34:48] outpouring of God in this one body
[34:51] called Christ. Are you with me? And
[34:55] basically what happens now we can look
[34:58] back from 2025 and we can look back into
[35:00] the into the past and we see something
[35:03] very significant.
[35:05] Ah it takes a coming of the son of man
[35:08] to change a major dispensation.
[35:12] [snorts]
[35:12] It took a coming of a son of man the
[35:14] first coming to change from father
[35:17] to son
[35:19] to holy ghost dispensation. It takes
[35:22] this coming. So if there is a coming of
[35:25] the son of man, it's going to change A
[35:26] DISPENSATION.
[35:28] WHAT IS CHANGING A DISPENSATION of God?
[35:30] It's bringing a new song,
[35:33] a new temple, a new word, a new
[35:36] testament, a new way of worship, A NEW
[35:39] WAY OF PREACHING, A NEW REVELATION, a
[35:41] new path to God, A NEW WAY OF SALVATION.
[35:47] It was here that God revealed himself in
[35:50] human flesh as a vessel of flesh. all
[35:53] previous dispensations and covenants. In
[35:56] other words, conscience and law was now
[35:59] in Christ, perfected in Christ. Are you
[36:03] with me? And he was a man of full
[36:07] maturity.
[36:10] Is that right? Now, under this
[36:12] dispensation, he made a covenant of
[36:15] salvation,
[36:17] right? through his own blood a covenant
[36:21] of new life after death. So what does
[36:24] Christ come to confirm? That if you
[36:26] believe in me, you shall have
[36:28] everlasting life. Right? If you believe
[36:31] in me, though you die, you shall live
[36:33] again. It's a covenant I'm making with
[36:37] you. He's saying, right? And he makes a
[36:40] covenant of filling the living with the
[36:43] Holy Ghost.
[36:45] I will not leave you comfortless.
[36:48] I will pray the father. He will send you
[36:50] the holy ghost in my name. He shall
[36:52] guide you into all truth.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; Are you with us? This dispensation was
[37:00] about introducing a character of a man
[37:04] of full maturity in God. The stature of
[37:08] the fullness of Christ.
[37:11] Why did he have to show you this?
[37:12] because you now have a directive that
[37:15] you can be that
[37:18] and that it's going to take the next few
[37:19] ages to bring that to pass. Are you with
[37:23] us? So it was greatly rejected by the
[37:27] world at that time. They crucified that
[37:29] man. They put him to death not realizing
[37:33] that was the very purpose so that he
[37:35] could show that he could live again. And
[37:38] that time and it began at the next major
[37:43] uh dispensation. That little
[37:44] dispensation of 33 and 1/2 years began
[37:47] the next major dispensation. Are you
[37:49] still with me?
[37:51] &gt;&gt; So let's shrink down the church ages.
[37:56] This is now the age of grace. That is
[38:00] that blue blue arrow? It's not green,
[38:02] right? Okay. Age of grace. Now in
[38:06] between there right there in the center
[38:07] the first thousand years we we already
[38:09] hit the dark ages
[38:11] right in the age of Thotyra. Are you
[38:13] with us? Right. So during this 2,000
[38:16] years there are the seven church ages as
[38:19] prophesied in the book of revelations.
[38:22] This is now God with us
[38:25] and in the elect. So he said he we'll
[38:29] read the scripture. God with us and in
[38:32] you. I will be with you and in you. So
[38:35] he's with us in terms of uh Christ the
[38:39] Holy Ghost with us but to the elect only
[38:43] the elect he would be also in them.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[38:50] &gt;&gt; In part this dispensation approximately
[38:54] 2,000 years lasted approximately 2,000
[38:56] years. It begins with the son of man
[38:59] first coming and it ends with son of man
[39:02] second coming
[39:04] &gt;&gt; right and it's a complete outpouring of
[39:08] the son
[39:09] the son of god
[39:12] right now you know I did this with you
[39:14] with so many series but I just want to
[39:17] explain that to you and just so you
[39:20] understand under the dispensation of the
[39:23] father in the first 4,000 years those
[39:26] men served God by conscience and the
[39:29] law. Those men were killers,
[39:34] voracious killers,
[39:39] violent men,
[39:42] right? They had no knowledge of Jesus
[39:44] Christ. They had no compassion for the
[39:47] weak.
[39:49] They were the ones given the task to go
[39:51] and take out the Canaanites and and
[39:53] cleanse the land of all the sin and and
[39:56] filth and iniquity and immoral
[39:58] immorality. Is that right? And these are
[40:01] the people who This is uh David who
[40:04] kills Goliath with a stone that sinks
[40:08] through the guy's forehead.
[40:10] This is Samson who tears apart a lion
[40:14] and kills a thousand uh Philistines with
[40:17] the jawbone of a donkey.
[40:20] Uh you know need I go on to tell you how
[40:23] many of them and what their acts were.
[40:27] Those were ACTS OF THE HOLY Spirit in
[40:31] man according to the dispensation for
[40:34] their day.
[40:36] Don't you think for one second you can
[40:39] go and take out the Vatican with the
[40:42] jawbone of a donkey
[40:45] &gt;&gt; or think you can go fight against the
[40:47] Pentecostals with actual violence or
[40:50] think you're going to go take down the
[40:52] mark of the beast with hordes of message
[40:55] people storming their buildings.
[40:59] That was a different dispensation. Yes.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; This dispensation is suffer the wrong,
[41:06] turn the other cheek,
[41:09] &gt;&gt; love your enemies.
[41:12] [clears throat]
[41:12] &gt;&gt; This do you understand how this is the
[41:14] dispensation of son?
[41:16] &gt;&gt; It's a completely different relationship
[41:19] between God and man. Is there is nothing
[41:22] that compares it to the father
[41:25] dispensation. Absolute chalk and cheese.
[41:30] There's that phrase complete opposites.
[41:34] Are you with me?
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Can you see that? So this is why even
[41:39] trying to behave like you know like you
[41:42] can just see today you know you see some
[41:44] guy there who's a Christian and then
[41:46] he's he he grows out his beard and puts
[41:48] a stick on and takes a robe and puts it
[41:51] over him and takes off shoes and wears
[41:53] sandals and walks around in the hills
[41:55] muttering to himself. You're not going
[41:57] to think he's an Old Testament prophet.
[41:59] You'd think it's crazy
[42:01] &gt;&gt; because God's not dealing with us with
[42:03] Old Testament prophets anymore.
[42:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOBODY COMING out of the
[42:07] wilderness who eats locusts and wild
[42:09] honey and like John the Baptist to come
[42:12] and tell you something and you'll think,
[42:14] "Go have a bath, man." You know, come to
[42:18] church, clean up.
[42:20] It's a completely new dispensation.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; A new revelation of God himself. A new
[42:26] song, a new worship, a new testament, a
[42:30] new temple, a new way of worship, and
[42:32] new scriptures,
[42:36] completely new REVELATION OF THE SAME
[42:38] GOD.
[42:40] Are you with us?
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. In here is the covenant of leading
[42:46] us into all truth. Is that the promise?
[42:48] He will lead you into all truth.
[42:50] Covenant of the secret coming in that
[42:54] throughout the ages the covenant was
[42:56] kept. He is coming. He is coming. He is
[43:00] coming again. The advent of Christ in
[43:03] the fourth age. Is that right? Right up
[43:05] to the last days until it becomes and
[43:07] there's the theology of the rapture that
[43:10] comes in among the Pentecostals.
[43:12] He is coming. Christ is coming. Jesus is
[43:14] coming. Uh I mean in South Africa, South
[43:18] Africa was a very very Christian country
[43:20] for a long time
[43:23] until recently.
[43:25] But it was always, you know, you could
[43:27] you could drive around, you'll see
[43:28] painted on the rocks, under bridges, at
[43:31] the train stations, at the bus depot.
[43:33] Jesus is coming. Jesus is coming. Now
[43:35] it's a whole lot of junk and graffiti
[43:37] and rubbish that they paint everywhere.
[43:40] Before it used to be Jesus is coming in
[43:43] all kinds of languages, too.
[43:45] Oh yeah, not anymore. It seems to have
[43:48] escaped them. So it was a complete
[43:52] outpouring of the sun was the first
[43:54] dispensation. This is now the
[43:57] dispensation of God upon the Gentiles
[44:02] under the father. It was the
[44:03] dispensation of God over the Jews,
[44:06] Israel, Abram's seed, Adam's lineage.
[44:10] Are you with us? THIS IS THE FIRST
[44:12] DISPENSATION OF God through the son
[44:15] Jesus Christ. God revealing HIMSELF AS
[44:18] GOD TO GENTILES
[44:20] WITHOUT OR OUTSIDE OF JUDAISM.
[44:25] In other words, we don't need a high
[44:27] priest. We don't need the ark of the
[44:29] covenant. We don't need a lamb and a
[44:31] bullock and a ram for atonement. We
[44:34] don't need sacrifices of letting the
[44:36] living bird loose and the speckled bird
[44:38] and oh the the the goats. We don't need
[44:42] uh a Passover, feast of unleaven bread,
[44:45] feast of trumpets, feast of Pentecost,
[44:47] feast of first fruits, uh feast of
[44:50] atonement, FEAST OF TABERNACLES. WE
[44:52] DON'T NEED ALL THAT. THAT WAS WORSHIP TO
[44:55] GOD AT ONE STAGE. WE DON'T HAVE any of
[44:58] that today.
[44:59] I shouldn't even be saying this, but I'm
[45:01] saying this because I want to make you
[45:03] understand. It was a complete flip.
[45:08] Same God
[45:11] different dispensation, different
[45:13] covenants. But once again,
[45:17] to those who were under those covenants,
[45:21] they failed. They failed in every age to
[45:24] let the Holy Ghost lead them into all
[45:26] truth.
[45:28] They denominated.
[45:30] They made up stories about the the come
[45:33] the coming of the Lord. They made up new
[45:35] theologies, new ideas, and it failed
[45:38] them.
[45:40] Let's read John 14 16.
[45:45] Oh my. I think I didn't put this in. Did
[45:46] I not put this in?
[45:49] Um, looks like I didn't. All right, I'll
[45:52] just read this to you. John 14:16-1 17.
[45:54] And I will pray the Father. He shall
[45:56] give you another comforter that he might
[45:58] abide with you forever. Even the spirit
[46:01] of truth whom the world cannot receive
[46:04] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[46:07] him but you know him for he dwelleth
[46:10] with you and shall be in you. So this
[46:13] would be a continuation of Emmanuel
[46:16] which is God with us but only to the
[46:18] elect it is also God in us.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; In other words God dwelling with us.
[46:24] Listen he said for he dwelleth with you.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Yes
[46:28] &gt;&gt; now already.
[46:30] But he shall be in you. A promise of the
[46:34] future. You will not only have Emmanuel,
[46:37] God with you. Will not only have God
[46:39] with you in in the presence of the Holy
[46:42] Ghost. You will all he shall be in you.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; There's a promise of him going to be in
[46:47] you as well.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; So in other words, when when they got
[46:51] the Holy Ghost in the the church ages,
[46:53] they had the earnest
[46:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; of the inheritance. They had the down
[46:58] payment. They had a portion of the Holy
[47:01] Spirit in each age waiting for the full
[47:04] payment
[47:07] &gt;&gt; and they did not attain it.
[47:11] A new covenant was made under the
[47:13] dispensation and there would be a return
[47:15] of the son of man. All right, let's get
[47:16] to the second mysterious dispensation of
[47:20] son of man which is our day. Now
[47:25] this is the problem.
[47:28] This is where you're stuck. This is
[47:30] where Christians of the world are stuck.
[47:32] We have been promised the days of
[47:34] Elijah. We've been promised the days of
[47:37] the son of man returning.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[47:39] &gt;&gt; we know this from Luke 17:30. We know
[47:42] this from other scriptures. In the day
[47:44] of the son of man, when the son of man
[47:46] is revealed, we have all those
[47:48] scriptures. Christ is speaking of that
[47:50] as being in the future while he is
[47:53] there.
[47:54] In other words, while he's there was not
[47:56] the revealing of the son of man.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Yet, the son of man was there. HE'S
[48:00] SAYING THERE'S COMING A DAY WHEN THE SON
[48:02] OF MAN SHALL be revealed.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; So, there's plenty of of evidence in the
[48:08] scripture pointing us. Now, the thing
[48:10] is, has that happened or not?
[48:15] Right? And if it happens, this is once
[48:18] again going to be God with us.
[48:24] Amen.
[48:26] [clears throat]
[48:26] &gt;&gt; A son of man revealing the son of man.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; A dispensation of God with us. What
[48:34] happens here if you can receive it is
[48:38] the opening of the seventh seal
[48:40] twofolds,
[48:42] right?
[48:44] The cloud, the mysterious week and a
[48:47] covenant of marriage.
[48:50] In other words, a bride is going to be
[48:52] pulled out. There is going to be a bride
[48:55] in this last day. We saw that covenant
[48:57] taking place where the prophet was
[48:59] saying, "Lord, he was so fatting about
[49:01] it. What is my purpose?" Whatever. And
[49:02] he opens up in his Genesis 24.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Right. In other words, an Elisa
[49:08] commission.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; Given to this ministry to go and find a
[49:12] bride for Isaac.
[49:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. This is the covenants made
[49:16] under this mysterious coming of the son
[49:20] of man.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Now if you receive it, you become a part
[49:25] of that ministry. If you don't receive
[49:28] it, you're not. You're going to continue
[49:31] as if you're continuing in a seventh
[49:33] church age waiting for something to
[49:35] happen.
[49:37] BUT IF YOUR EYES ARE OPEN to it like
[49:39] Rebecca who sees Elea, accepts the
[49:42] message, accepts the secret under the
[49:45] seventh seal and comes out to see him in
[49:48] the field, takes the camels home, sees
[49:51] him in the field, and goes with him into
[49:53] the third fold, which is the tent.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; All the types are there. There's a
[49:58] covenant of marriage made here.
[50:01] Declaration of time being no more.
[50:05] This is what happens under this. This is
[50:08] the amazing thing because when the
[50:10] seventh seal opens, there's a
[50:12] declaration of marriage. That's a
[50:13] mystery under the seventh seal. And a
[50:16] declaration that time shall be no more.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; That's what this whole thing is all
[50:21] about now, right? God with us. And this
[50:25] again is a quick short mysterious
[50:28] dispensation
[50:29] overlapping the dispensation of the Holy
[50:31] Ghost. In other words, the grace age is
[50:34] continuing. This one drops in and it
[50:36] overlaps that and is moving us out. A
[50:39] third exodus taking a bride out of a
[50:41] church.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; The covenant of marriage made a promise
[50:45] was made that a short new age would
[50:47] occur in which a GROUP OF FULLY MATURED
[50:50] SONS and daughters of God would be able
[50:53] to come into THE MARRIAGE OF THE word
[50:57] &gt;&gt; and the bride,
[50:58] &gt;&gt; A STATE OF EQUALITY WITH HIM.
[51:02] WHAT IS happening that logos who was in
[51:05] the beginning HAS COME TO HIS
[51:08] counterpart on earth HIS CO-EQUAL part
[51:13] to be united. It could never happen
[51:16] under any other dispensation.
[51:18] The logos could never be married to
[51:20] those under the father dispensation
[51:24] was constantly making intercession for
[51:26] them through the blood of animals.
[51:28] Is that right? They could never attain
[51:30] equality.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Under the grace dispensation. What is
[51:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the age
[51:37] of grace all about? IT'S INTERCESSION
[51:39] FOR IGNORANCE.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; YES.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. For ignorance, not mistakes and
[51:45] failures and faults and all that.
[51:47] Ignorance meaning you're worshiping GOD
[51:50] ONLY PART KNOWING HIM.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; Having only part revelation OF WHO GOD
[51:56] IS. YOU COULD NOT COME TO THE MARRIAGE.
[51:59] SO THERE HAS TO be a dispensation where
[52:02] the fullness of the word is come. IT
[52:04] COMES TO A FULLY MATURED GROUP OF people
[52:07] who come to the fullness,
[52:10] &gt;&gt; the equality.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; YES.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; TO BECOME EQUAL PARTNERS WITH the logos.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; That's the marriage
[52:21] was a combining. It's a blending. It's a
[52:24] coming together of two dimensions. the
[52:26] dimension of heaven and earth. Before
[52:29] this marriage could happen under the
[52:33] ministry of Elea, a mighty angel, a
[52:38] messenger
[52:39] from heaven had to descend into this
[52:42] dimension and declare that time is no
[52:46] more and declare the last dispensation
[52:50] coming to an end. Yes,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; that would be declaring what? The
[52:55] dispensation of the fullness of times
[52:59] &gt;&gt; in which he would gather together all
[53:02] things in Christ in one, both which are
[53:05] in heaven and which are in earth, even
[53:08] in him.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; That's where we are.
[53:11] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[53:12] &gt;&gt; we can literally look back in history
[53:14] and and see that we are not in that Holy
[53:17] Ghost dispensation anymore. We are not
[53:19] in the grace age anymore. Of course, we
[53:22] have received grace.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; We're not saying there's no more grace.
[53:26] WE CAN'T EVEN SAY THERE'S no more law.
[53:29] We don't even say there's no more
[53:30] conscience. We be dead.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; YES.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; ALL OF THAT STILL EXISTS. THERE'S JUST A
[53:37] NEW DISPENSATION WHICH IS THE PERFECTION
[53:40] of all others.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So, that's where we
[53:45] are right now. the dispensation of the
[53:47] bride. God is no more above us,
[53:50] invisible, pillar of fire, pillar of
[53:52] cloud. God is no longer Jesus Christ
[53:55] from 2,000 years ago. GOD IS NO LONGER
[53:58] JUST HOLY GHOST, BAPTISM, ANOINTINGS,
[54:02] HEALINGS, MIRACLES, DISCERNMENTS, all
[54:03] those kind of things. GOD IS NO LONGER
[54:06] JUST THOSE THINGS. God is now becoming
[54:09] his bride.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. his people WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL
[54:16] PLAN FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE story of
[54:19] God and man. He created man for this
[54:23] purpose. AND THIS IS THE TRIAL of people
[54:26] today because your sin, your mistakes,
[54:29] your problems. This is a reason why
[54:32] pastors and ministers can't accept this
[54:34] coming
[54:36] BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ACCEPT THAT GOD CAN
[54:38] BE YOU.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT THAT GOD CAN
[54:42] be you? Number one is your definition of
[54:45] God.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; YES.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S your main problem. You don't
[54:49] understand the mystery of God. YOU THINK
[54:53] GOD IS JUST AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP TO WHOM
[54:55] OTHERS must bow down, sing, and pray to.
[55:01] That's the starting point. If you don't
[55:03] know what God is, you could never be
[55:05] him.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:08] And that's why they they criticize us
[55:10] and tell us like I DON'T KNOW WHY ARE
[55:12] YOU IN THE MESSAGE THEN WHY DON'T JUST
[55:15] GO TO DENOMINATION WHAT ARE YOU HEARING
[55:17] THE MESSAGE BECAUSE THE MESSAGE TELLS US
[55:19] THIS
[55:20] &gt;&gt; THIS VERY THING
[55:22] &gt;&gt; THAT THIS IS WHAT WE WERE CHOSEN FOR
[55:25] &gt;&gt; LIKE I I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU PREACHING
[55:27] THE SEVENTH SEAL WHY TALKING about and
[55:29] using buzzwords WHY READING THE
[55:31] SCRIPTURE WHY TALKING ABOUT IT IF YOU
[55:33] DON'T BELIEVE IT JUST LET IT GO AND WALK
[55:36] WAY.
[55:39] AMEN. This is the fullness of times. The
[55:43] fullness
[55:44] means the maximum.
[55:47] It means to come to complete maturity.
[55:50] It therefore refers to the age of
[55:53] adopted sons, manifested sons.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; THOSE WHO WERE BECOMING SONS ARE NOW
[55:59] become sons.
[56:03] And yes,
[56:05] this is this is the mediocre
[56:09] limp noodle
[56:12] arguments [clears throat]
[56:14] that I get. Oh, if you're a son, where's
[56:17] the power of spoken word? Why aren't you
[56:20] speaking things into existence?
[56:23] Well, I'm like, I wish I COULD SPEAK
[56:25] YOUR STUPIDITY OUT OF EXISTENCE.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; That's where I am right now.
[56:33] BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL
[56:34] ABOUT. WE'RE NOT here to go and make
[56:37] miracles because we know it's already
[56:40] been told us that in the Bible that that
[56:43] THAT THAT POWER that beast power coming
[56:46] out of the earth is GOING TO GO OFF and
[56:49] and deceive the whole world with
[56:51] MIRACLES AND CAUSE FIRE TO COME OUT FROM
[56:53] HEAVEN. WHAT WHAT are we doing? Trying
[56:56] to fight back with that beast. This is
[56:59] the time where I MEAN
[57:02] WHY do you need to go and speak things
[57:06] into existence
[57:07] when you can't even deal with your own
[57:10] marriage
[57:12] &gt;&gt; or your children or your house or get
[57:17] some good accounting so you pay your
[57:19] bills
[57:21] &gt;&gt; and don't run short. You want to manage
[57:23] God's kingdom and speak things into
[57:25] existence. You can't even manage your
[57:27] own budget.
[57:31] THIS IS THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS IS
[57:33] IMMATURITY.
[57:36] What are WE WAITING FOR? OH, I CAN'T
[57:38] WAIT, BROTHER. WHEN I GET THE POWER OF
[57:40] GOD, I'M GOING TO SPEAK THINGS INTO
[57:42] EXISTENCE. YEAH.
[57:44] You think you got the solution for the
[57:46] world? I'm going to speak this out of
[57:48] existence. I'm going to solve the
[57:49] world's problems. It's like a grandiose
[57:52] narcissistic thinking like I need to
[57:54] solve everyone's problems so they look
[57:56] at us and see, OH, THE BRIDE
[57:58] OH, THE sons of God. Look at them. How
[58:01] beautiful they are. They're our saviors.
[58:03] We love them.
[58:05] No. You saw what they did with Christ.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; He was all that.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; They hated him. They nashed their teeth
[58:14] at him. They spent night and day
[58:16] conspiring. How are we going to get him?
[58:18] How are we going to kill him? HOW ARE WE
[58:20] GOING TO PROVE THAT HE'S THIS? HOW ARE
[58:21] WE GOING TO PROVE THAT HE'S AN that he's
[58:23] a Antichrist? That he's not the Messiah.
[58:26] Can you imagine such men obsessed,
[58:30] you know? Like, man, just take a break.
[58:33] Go do some gardening.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Go milk THE COWS.
[58:38] THEY'RE SO OBSESSED LIKE THEY ARE TODAY
[58:43] frothing at the mouth, you know, like
[58:45] like foot and mouth disease or
[58:46] something. THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE. IT'S
[58:49] LIKE,
[58:50] LET'S GO HAVE COFFEE AND DISCUSS HOW WE
[58:53] CAN TAKE THEM DOWN.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[58:56] &gt;&gt; It's really maniacal. I don't know. To
[58:59] me, I all these anti- message people. I
[59:02] don't even know what's the big deal. Why
[59:04] not just leave us alone? We don't even
[59:06] make a dent in the world. We're not even
[59:09] like a billion people. We're not even
[59:11] like millions of people. Nobody listens
[59:13] to us. Nobody takes us seriously
[59:15] anymore. And when they see us, they, oh,
[59:17] you're that group. Okay.
[59:19] Nice to see you. Bye. Now,
[59:22] [clears throat]
[59:23] nobody wants to listen to us. We are
[59:25] totally rejected. WE'RE NOT EVEN TRYING
[59:26] TO get into your homes. We're not even
[59:29] trying to live rentree in your heads.
[59:31] What's going on?
[59:34] Why not just let us be? You know, let us
[59:36] be. Let us go away and fade away in our
[59:38] madness like you say.
[59:41] No, they got to go on the internet and
[59:43] blast us and lambaste us and shame us
[59:45] and go take down our churches and call
[59:48] us cults. And we're not even doing
[59:50] anything. We're not even fighting back.
[59:53] It's like every time you beat us, we're
[59:55] just And then you beat us again.
[1:00:00] I don't understand.
[1:00:02] Actually, I do.
[1:00:06] When something
[1:00:08] convicts you and you know it's right and
[1:00:13] you know it's nagging at you, you can't
[1:00:15] let it go.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:17] You have to find a way to prove it wrong
[1:00:20] for yourself.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; That's the problem.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; We're not pushing it at you. I mean,
[1:00:25] this this humble man made so many
[1:00:27] mistakes, grammatical errors. He said
[1:00:31] some things here this way, another thing
[1:00:32] here, that way, and this that way, and
[1:00:34] this prophecy was spoken in this fashion
[1:00:36] here, and later on he spoke it in this
[1:00:38] way, slightly different to that. I mean,
[1:00:40] you could go, you get so exhausted. I'm
[1:00:43] telling you, sitting with them and
[1:00:46] talking this out and being an apologist
[1:00:49] is just the wrong thing to don't even
[1:00:50] get into that. There's there's
[1:00:53] absolutely no reason. In fact, if anyone
[1:00:55] comes up to you and the anti- William
[1:00:57] Brandham, just say, "Yes, I agree with
[1:00:58] you." Walk away.
[1:01:01] Yes, you're right. Wow.
[1:01:04] And walk away. SHAKE HANDS. GOD BLESS
[1:01:06] YOU, MAN. You're the greatest. Walk
[1:01:09] away.
[1:01:10] That's all. just take the whole poke the
[1:01:13] balloon and take all the air out because
[1:01:16] you're not going to get anywhere. THEY
[1:01:18] ARE TRYING TO fight back to prove it to
[1:01:20] themselves
[1:01:22] to make them feel good about the lives
[1:01:25] they're living because that word is
[1:01:26] convicting them.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; It's killing them.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; That's just what that's the truth. You
[1:01:36] young people, anyone when you come to me
[1:01:39] and question me on the message and the
[1:01:40] prophet and start to tell me it's false.
[1:01:43] Believe me, I know what's happening in
[1:01:44] your head. It's convicting you. You want
[1:01:47] to do stuff, but you feel like the
[1:01:48] message is preventing you from doing
[1:01:50] that's all.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; This is how this is how humans work.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; If they want to do something, you really
[1:01:56] want to do it, go do it. Go do it. Go
[1:01:59] see what happens after that. Then come
[1:02:01] back. We'll still be here.
[1:02:03] except you'll just come back a little
[1:02:05] bit dented and cut and bruised and not
[1:02:07] the same as you you would be if you
[1:02:09] didn't go there. See that? That's what
[1:02:12] I'm saying. But when you come to me and
[1:02:14] start attacking a man of God who
[1:02:16] dedicated his life to the word who had
[1:02:19] manifestations of the word of God in his
[1:02:21] life of the pillar of fire of a whole
[1:02:24] lot of other things and maybe he spoke
[1:02:27] in some weird way that doesn't make
[1:02:29] sense to you and said inconsistent
[1:02:31] things but you're fighting back against
[1:02:33] it because it's inconvenient to you then
[1:02:36] just be honest.
[1:02:38] say, "I don't I want to do stuff, you
[1:02:41] know, brother Al. I want to go out and
[1:02:43] enjoy my life and, you know, I want to
[1:02:45] get a couple of girlfriends and see how
[1:02:47] that works out. Go, man.
[1:02:52] GO HAVE FUN. GO FIND YOURSELF. We'll
[1:02:55] still be here."
[1:02:57] I can't tell you how many times it has
[1:02:59] happened.
[1:03:01] You know, you get some some young man
[1:03:04] and tell me, "Oh, brother, I crossed the
[1:03:06] line."
[1:03:08] Really? You crossed the line
[1:03:11] or you want to?
[1:03:17] You want me to tell you it's okay. You
[1:03:20] should not be in our church anymore. You
[1:03:23] want it to be my fault that you leave.
[1:03:26] Just be a man. Get a spine man. Leave.
[1:03:30] Say, "I'm I'm making this decision for
[1:03:32] myself. I'm going. I want to figure it
[1:03:34] out. I be honest. I'll respect you. But
[1:03:36] don't come here and make me chase you
[1:03:38] out
[1:03:41] so that you can say they chase me out.
[1:03:45] [clears throat]
[1:03:45] [snorts]
[1:03:47] No, we need men. We need real men and
[1:03:49] women today who can can have a real
[1:03:52] spine and take responsibility for their
[1:03:54] actions.
[1:03:55] Are you with us?
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; So the fullness of time means the
[1:04:00] maximum of times the maturity of times.
[1:04:02] What does this mean? This means that all
[1:04:05] this is the dispensation.
[1:04:07] This dispensation where all the
[1:04:09] covenants that have not been fulfilled.
[1:04:13] This is not the dispensation of the
[1:04:15] fullness of time.
[1:04:18] This is the dispensation of the fullness
[1:04:19] of times.
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:22] In other words, it's the fullness of the
[1:04:24] time of Noah, the fullness of the time
[1:04:27] of Abraham, the fullness of the time of
[1:04:29] Moses, the fullness of In other words,
[1:04:31] it's coming to its maximum. All the
[1:04:34] covenants that were not realized
[1:04:37] are going to be realized.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:41] See, Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, the
[1:04:44] first coming of Christ, the church, all
[1:04:46] manifestations there in the past, all
[1:04:49] the covenants are being fulfilled now.
[1:04:52] This is the fullness of times plural.
[1:04:56] Amen. Are you are you with me, saints?
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:10 did not say the fullness
[1:05:01] of time. It said the fullness of times
[1:05:04] plural. Let's read. Who is this
[1:05:06] MelkiseDC? All right, buckle your seat
[1:05:08] belts.
[1:05:10] This one just puts it all together for
[1:05:13] us. [clears throat] Notice like the
[1:05:15] sculpture, he hides with a mask over it.
[1:05:19] That's what God has done to this age.
[1:05:22] It's been hid. It's supposed to be
[1:05:24] revealed in this age. Now, the Bible
[1:05:27] says they will be revealed in the latter
[1:05:30] times. It's like a sculptor keeping his
[1:05:34] piece of work all covered until the time
[1:05:37] he takes the mask off. And there it is.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; You with us?
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And that's what the Bible has been. It's
[1:05:46] been a work of God that's been covered
[1:05:49] up. It's been hid since the foundation
[1:05:52] of the world. And it's sevenfold
[1:05:55] mystery. AND GOD PROMISED IN THIS day at
[1:06:00] the age of this Leodysian age, he would
[1:06:02] take the mask off the whole thing and we
[1:06:06] could see it.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a glorious thing. God and
[1:06:10] Morphe masked in the pillar of fire.
[1:06:13] Where are we? Oh, you you changed it.
[1:06:16] Are we together? Paragraph 43. God and
[1:06:19] Morphe mosque in the pillar of fire.
[1:06:22] Got it.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; God and Morphe in a man called Jesus.
[1:06:28] God and Morphe masked.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Masked in a man called Jesus.
[1:06:35] God in morphe in his church and there it
[1:06:39] is God above us. God with us. God in us
[1:06:44] the condescending God.
[1:06:48] Condescending does not mean he looks
[1:06:49] down on you like the modern. This is the
[1:06:53] prophet's meaning of condescending means
[1:06:57] losing a previous state to take on a
[1:07:00] lower one. To take on a lower one.
[1:07:02] That's what he means by that. Are you
[1:07:04] with us?
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; So we go back to Ephesians 1:10
[1:07:07] which says that in the dispensation of
[1:07:09] the fullness of times he might gather
[1:07:12] together in one all things in Christ.
[1:07:13] All right. So did you see? Now I want
[1:07:16] you to do this
[1:07:18] when you go back home. Some of you
[1:07:20] students of the scripture uh and the
[1:07:23] message go back and look at this
[1:07:26] previous one which is God above us, God
[1:07:30] with us, God in us. go and type it into
[1:07:32] your table or whatever word word
[1:07:34] searches you have and search for that
[1:07:37] God above us, God with us, God in us.
[1:07:40] You will come up with a treasure trove
[1:07:43] of the same statement with so much more
[1:07:46] revelation in it. I don't have the time
[1:07:48] to do it. Maybe one of you can pick it
[1:07:50] up and preach that those three vers
[1:07:53] those three phrases, but go have a look
[1:07:55] at it. So that's why I'm telling you
[1:07:56] everything I told you is from the
[1:07:58] message. God [snorts] above, God with
[1:08:01] us, God in us. You I think there's one
[1:08:04] quote where it even speaks about God in
[1:08:07] us becoming manifested sons.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; I I I think it's there. So go have a
[1:08:13] look at it. Right. So let's go to
[1:08:15] fullness of times. Gathered together in
[1:08:17] one all things in Christ. So number one,
[1:08:20] gather together in one all things in
[1:08:22] Christ. Now let's go through this
[1:08:23] quickly. What is gather together? Easy,
[1:08:26] right? Unite.
[1:08:28] bring it all together. Gathering.
[1:08:31] Okay. He's not uniting all things uh uh
[1:08:37] like uniting all things in Christ. The
[1:08:41] So the question is what is in Christ?
[1:08:44] Right? So when we say uniting, most
[1:08:46] people think of, you know, we're all
[1:08:48] agreeing,
[1:08:50] right? That that's like something that
[1:08:53] never happens. You can never get people
[1:08:55] all gathered together and agreeing,
[1:08:58] but you can gather together, right? So,
[1:09:01] let's bring it all in. What is Christ?
[1:09:04] Christ is the manifested word,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; the word made flesh. So, what is God
[1:09:11] doing? He's gathering everything
[1:09:13] together in the word made flesh.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Christ means Messiah. The Messiah is the
[1:09:21] word manifested. So what was the word?
[1:09:25] The word was the logos who was HAD ALL
[1:09:29] THE ATTRIBUTES IN HIM,
[1:09:31] RIGHT? THE ATTRIBUTES OF HIMSELF. SO GOD
[1:09:33] IS GATHERING all the attributes of
[1:09:35] himself that were in the logos. He's
[1:09:38] gathering it together in Christ. That
[1:09:41] means in the word made flesh.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Sons of God that shouted for joy as
[1:09:47] attribute form are now coming together
[1:09:49] in flesh form. They are being gathered
[1:09:52] together. Not all coming to one place.
[1:09:55] No one's running to Jeffersonville.
[1:09:58] No one's running to No. Gathering
[1:10:00] together means bringing them around the
[1:10:03] revealed word.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Man, we can literally be miles apart,
[1:10:09] but we are together.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it also means all the
[1:10:15] attributes to one new revelation of
[1:10:20] himself.
[1:10:21] And you can see that Revelations 5, when
[1:10:23] the lamb took the book, they sang a new
[1:10:25] song. Is that right?
[1:10:29] A new song, a new worship,
[1:10:32] a worship beyond the New Testament.
[1:10:36] This is the lamb taking the book. A new
[1:10:39] song is going to be sung because the the
[1:10:41] book is going to be brought down by the
[1:10:43] lamb. The seals have been broken off.
[1:10:46] The Bible becomes a new book. THE MOSQUE
[1:10:50] IS PULLED OFF.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And that happens right
[1:10:56] there in that Leodysian church age when
[1:10:59] that seventh seal is being broke. The
[1:11:01] mighty angel descends, the seventh seal
[1:11:03] is open, the book comes down, the mosque
[1:11:07] is pulled off, seven seals are broken,
[1:11:11] the book is revealed.
[1:11:13] Amen. So that one revelation is not by a
[1:11:18] certain doctrine but by his personal
[1:11:21] visitation to each believer.
[1:11:24] Are we together?
[1:11:27] Why are we together [laughter] in
[1:11:30] Christ?
[1:11:32] How is everyone going to get that one
[1:11:34] revelation?
[1:11:38] He has to come to each person. Yes.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be one brother
[1:11:43] preaching a certain way or one
[1:11:46] revelation being preached or series
[1:11:49] being taught by some person. No, he's
[1:11:52] going to do this through multiple men in
[1:11:55] the ministry of Christ. And he is going
[1:11:58] to visit each individual under all THOSE
[1:12:01] MINISTRIES.
[1:12:03] THERE'LL BE OTHERS under those same
[1:12:04] ministries that will not get it.
[1:12:07] God will visit each individual who is a
[1:12:11] part of that
[1:12:13] and they will be brought together under
[1:12:15] that one revelation.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; All right, let's look at this highlight
[1:12:19] the next part of it. Now we go to things
[1:12:21] which are in heaven and which are in
[1:12:24] earth even in him. So notice it doesn't
[1:12:27] say things under the earth
[1:12:31] on earth, right?
[1:12:34] He's not bringing those uh under the
[1:12:37] earth is a phrase meaning the fifth
[1:12:39] dimension.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. So we we're not bringing things in
[1:12:44] that's in the fifth dimension. Things on
[1:12:47] earth and things which are in heaven.
[1:12:50] Nothing anymore of Christ in the
[1:12:52] dimension that was once called under the
[1:12:54] earth. There is nothing.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Right? In other words, there's no more
[1:12:59] bosom of Abraham.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Got it? There's no paradise in the fifth
[1:13:03] dimension. There's nothing there
[1:13:04] anymore. It's all been emptied out.
[1:13:06] Right? So attributes that were in the
[1:13:09] what what what are we talking about? The
[1:13:12] closing of the story of God and man,
[1:13:14] RIGHT? ALL THE attributes from the
[1:13:16] beginning
[1:13:18] through this dispensation have been sown
[1:13:23] over time. Now we come to the
[1:13:26] dispensation, the fullness of times
[1:13:28] where all things must come together. All
[1:13:31] they without us cannot be made perfect.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; We are now the closing stage. Right? So
[1:13:38] the attributes that were in the word
[1:13:40] before the foundation of the world have
[1:13:42] been expressed on earth some were taken
[1:13:45] up to heaven which are the heavenly
[1:13:47] attributes still there as well as the
[1:13:49] attributes of him the bridegroom
[1:13:51] himself.
[1:13:53] Then there are attributes of the word
[1:13:55] who are in living vessels on earth right
[1:13:58] now. So that which is in heaven during
[1:14:01] this dispensation that comes to earth by
[1:14:05] the opening of the seventh seal with the
[1:14:07] attributes of the bridegroom, those
[1:14:09] attributes of the saints of old, those
[1:14:11] who died before us. They are basically
[1:14:13] the word that was manifested in the
[1:14:16] past.
[1:14:19] Some of them were foreshadows of Christ.
[1:14:22] Some of them came after Christ and have
[1:14:24] died. He's bringing them all together in
[1:14:27] one by the opening of the seventh seal
[1:14:32] by the mighty angel descending in him.
[1:14:35] It ends within him which is in the logos
[1:14:39] that began it all. He was heaven. He
[1:14:42] became earth. They are now attributes in
[1:14:45] heaven who have lived through the times
[1:14:46] and being called on by him. God has
[1:14:49] taken them home. But in the dispensation
[1:14:51] of the fullness of times there will
[1:14:53] there will uh the last attributes on
[1:14:55] earth for the completion of all things
[1:14:58] in Christ. That's where we are right
[1:15:00] now. Gathering all things together in
[1:15:03] him means bringing all the attributes in
[1:15:05] the revealed word for that dispensation.
[1:15:08] It is a new ruling system of governance.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; There is new governance.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The government shall be upon his
[1:15:18] shoulder. He is good about the paps.
[1:15:23] No longer about the loins.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; He's now good about the paps. He's the
[1:15:27] judge.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; There's a new system of government. When
[1:15:31] we say that,
[1:15:33] do you realize we are no longer the
[1:15:35] church?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; I no longer call you church. I call you
[1:15:39] bride. So you understand
[1:15:43] what what's different about the church?
[1:15:46] We are not just the called out ones
[1:15:48] anymore.
[1:15:50] Amen.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; We are not just people who are keeping
[1:15:53] traditions of Christianity and and
[1:15:56] keeping of footwashing and communion and
[1:15:58] keeping of of ordinances of baptisms and
[1:16:01] and all kinds of traditions and things.
[1:16:04] WE'RE NOT JUST ABOUT THAT. There's new
[1:16:07] ordinance. There's new governance
[1:16:10] because you are being brought into
[1:16:12] equality with him.
[1:16:16] You are not in the place of intercession
[1:16:19] for ignorance anymore.
[1:16:25] Big difference. Okay, let's bring this
[1:16:29] to a conclusion by talking about the
[1:16:31] predestinated behavior. Okay. Basically
[1:16:36] what happened uh is each attribute
[1:16:40] expressed a certain behavior on earth.
[1:16:42] In the time of Moses, in the time of
[1:16:44] Adam, in the time of Christ, in the time
[1:16:47] of the church ages, each attribute
[1:16:50] produced a certain behavior. Are you
[1:16:52] with me?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Okay. And that behavior WAS MANIFESTED
[1:16:57] BY THE attribute
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; in the person
[1:17:01] through the revealed word. In other
[1:17:03] words, so there you have this person.
[1:17:05] He's got an attribute in him. He only
[1:17:08] starts responding when the word for the
[1:17:10] day is preached.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; Because the attribute responds to the
[1:17:13] word.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; If the attribute doesn't have the word,
[1:17:16] the person just goes about doing what
[1:17:17] everybody else does.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; But once the word is spoken, THE
[1:17:21] ATTRIBUTE COMES ALIVE. THE ATTRIBUTE
[1:17:22] begins to manifest. Now that same person
[1:17:25] who came from his bloodline, his
[1:17:26] lineage, it could be German, French,
[1:17:29] Zulu, Shauna, whatever you are, wherever
[1:17:33] you come from, Indian, white, European,
[1:17:36] I don't care where you from, YOU START
[1:17:38] TO DENY THOSE THINGS. YOU START TO DENY
[1:17:41] WHERE you came from and you start
[1:17:43] MANIFESTING WHAT'S IN THE ATTRIBUTE.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; That means it produces a behavior.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. a new behavior.
[1:17:54] So it takes a revealed word coming. Do
[1:17:57] you agree? You cannot get the new
[1:17:59] behavior unless the word comes.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Right. Let's read in adoption message
[1:18:05] the predestinated behavior. Paragraph 74
[1:18:08] 7 page 74 paragraph 72. Now placing the
[1:18:11] son you with me. First thing after the
[1:18:13] son was in he become a son. But then we
[1:18:16] find out his behavior is what set him to
[1:18:20] adoption whether he behaved right or
[1:18:23] not.
[1:18:24] So what is the right behavior? The right
[1:18:27] behavior is not taught by law
[1:18:31] cood. It's not taught the right behavior
[1:18:34] for this last time is not right with
[1:18:37] regards to morals or standards.
[1:18:40] It never was.
[1:18:42] It's right by predestinated purpose.
[1:18:47] The predestinated behavior in Noah's day
[1:18:50] was waking up every day to go build that
[1:18:53] ark.
[1:18:56] The right behavior didn't tell him
[1:18:58] whether to drink coffee or not, whether
[1:19:00] to sleep longer, whether to speak nicely
[1:19:03] to his wife after she made breakfast,
[1:19:07] whether to speak nicely to his sons to
[1:19:09] encourage them to work, whether to No,
[1:19:14] it had nothing to do with what was
[1:19:15] morally right or it had to DO WITH THE
[1:19:18] PURPOSE OF BUILDING the ark.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; That's when that word is brought, it
[1:19:23] produces a behavior. The man doesn't
[1:19:25] know what's rain. He doesn't know what's
[1:19:27] flood. He's never seen it in his life.
[1:19:30] But he's he's got a behavior on him. An
[1:19:32] urgency to build this ark believing
[1:19:35] there's going to be rains and floods
[1:19:37] that's going TO DESTROY THE WHOLE WORLD.
[1:19:39] There's no way he can put that behavior
[1:19:41] on himself.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; it's right only because it produces the
[1:19:47] will for this day. What is the behavior
[1:19:49] for you for this day?
[1:19:52] Okay. So achieving the behavior, I just
[1:19:55] want to I just want to give you some
[1:19:56] hope. Before we close it down, watch
[1:20:00] this master teacher Paul. The first
[1:20:02] thing he does is knock out all the idea
[1:20:05] of falling away. Glory to God.
[1:20:11] The you notice what I tell the youth
[1:20:12] when you come and you you messed up your
[1:20:15] life or whatever, the first thing you
[1:20:17] need in your mind is I am a son of God.
[1:20:21] HELL IS NOT AN OPTION for me. There's no
[1:20:25] way I'm going to hell.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; That's where you start, right?
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; First thing Paul does is knock out the
[1:20:33] idea of falling away. He says, "Knock
[1:20:36] out all the idea of being a Christian
[1:20:38] today and tomorrow I'm gone and the next
[1:20:40] day God condemned me and the next day
[1:20:42] I'm back again." That's nonsense.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. This book is not addressed to
[1:20:47] evangelistic teaching, evangelistic
[1:20:49] sermons. We don't I don't touch this on
[1:20:52] a field. I bring this to the church for
[1:20:54] Paul addressed it to the saints. Those
[1:20:56] who are called,
[1:21:02] those that are called and preserved are
[1:21:04] filled and are set aside and are in the
[1:21:08] Holy Spirit already in Canaan's land.
[1:21:10] Are you with me? HE'S TRYING TO TELL
[1:21:13] them the first thing, get it out of your
[1:21:15] mind that you're going to get lost.
[1:21:18] You're going to do this. You're scared
[1:21:19] of this. Don't be scared of nothing. For
[1:21:22] he's trying to tell you where you're at,
[1:21:25] who you are, how you're standing,
[1:21:29] saints. There's no way you can put this
[1:21:31] behavior on you. Unless the word is
[1:21:34] revealed to you that you are the bride,
[1:21:36] you will not have this.
[1:21:39] Right? Notice how hard he goes on this
[1:21:42] and is against the spirit. He calls it
[1:21:44] nonsense.
[1:21:48] And this is what I want to tell you. The
[1:21:50] story of GOD AND MAN. I AM A SON OF GOD.
[1:21:54] Hell cannot hold me.
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; THE PLACE WILL BLOW UP.
[1:22:02] DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE I am. THAT'S WHERE I STAND.
[1:22:05] HELL CANNOT HOLD ME. THE GATES won't
[1:22:08] even let me in.
[1:22:12] The son of God has nothing to fear. No
[1:22:14] matter what happens, he knows that he
[1:22:17] has been chosen. There can be no doubt
[1:22:19] about his purpose. SO BEFORE YOU CAN
[1:22:21] EVEN START taking your land, get rid of
[1:22:24] that kind of nonsense thinking. There is
[1:22:27] no falling away for the children of God.
[1:22:30] Sure, you're going to make mistakes.
[1:22:32] There's something for that. How can you
[1:22:34] preach predestination of God for
[1:22:37] ordaining and setting unless there's a
[1:22:39] sin atonement somewhere? Why is it each
[1:22:41] day you make a mistake, each day you do
[1:22:43] wrong? But if you're born again, man or
[1:22:46] woman, AS SOON AS YOU MAKE A MISTAKE,
[1:22:49] God knows you're sorry for it.
[1:22:53] Before you apologize, BEFORE YOU REPENT,
[1:22:55] BEFORE YOU MAKE IT RIGHT, God already
[1:22:57] knows you're sorry for it. You can stand
[1:23:00] in the presence of President Roosevelt
[1:23:03] or anyone else and say, "I'm wrong. God
[1:23:05] forgive me for this thing." Why? That's
[1:23:07] where the blood of torment. You notice
[1:23:09] that sins, a sinner is a sinner. He does
[1:23:13] not commit sins. But the church commits
[1:23:15] sin, does wrong, gets a wrong thought,
[1:23:18] wrong impression, makes scruples,
[1:23:20] wobbles like a little child walking, try
[1:23:22] to learn uh uh how to walk. You don't
[1:23:24] know how to walk good yet cuz he's a
[1:23:26] little little boy. But we have a hand
[1:23:28] that reaches down. And if he gets us and
[1:23:30] steadies us and says, "Make the step
[1:23:32] away, son." He doesn't pick us up and
[1:23:35] spank us because we made a mistake. That
[1:23:37] was law age.
[1:23:40] HE DOESN'T BEAT US TO DEATH because
[1:23:42] we're trying to walk. He loves us like
[1:23:44] we love our children.
[1:23:47] He knows you have preferred. He knows
[1:23:50] you. He knows your life. He knows you
[1:23:51] would have preferred not to make
[1:23:53] mistakes. He knows you didn't want to do
[1:23:55] those wrong things. You didn't want TO
[1:23:56] MESS UP. HE KNOWS THAT. HE KNOWS YOUR
[1:23:59] HEART. HE KNOWS THE SEED. He knows the
[1:24:01] gene. He knows what your intentions are.
[1:24:04] His grace already made a way for all
[1:24:07] those THINGS WHEN HE CHOSE YOU.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; HE CHOSE you knowing YOU WOULD MAKE A
[1:24:12] MISTAKE TOMORROW.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; You still need to come to that
[1:24:16] understanding. You cannot come to
[1:24:18] equality while you can still believe I'm
[1:24:22] going to fall away.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; There's no equality there.
[1:24:27] like I still need intercession.
[1:24:31] You're never going to lose your place,
[1:24:33] sons of and daughters of God.
[1:24:36] You're never going to lose your place in
[1:24:37] his purpose. You're not going to lose
[1:24:38] your promise for this age. You will
[1:24:41] certainly pay for the things you've done
[1:24:44] wrong. You will pay for it here and now.
[1:24:47] And that's good for you.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Let's read
[1:24:52] now. You might do things wrong.
[1:24:54] Paragraph 36, adoption part three. You
[1:24:57] might do things WRONG AND EVERY TIME you
[1:24:59] do anything wrong, you're going to get
[1:25:01] paid for it. I told you everything I say
[1:25:04] to you is in the message. Yes, sir.
[1:25:07] You'll reap what you sow.
[1:25:11] So, stop complaining about the bad
[1:25:13] things.
[1:25:15] Okay? Some of the bad things you brought
[1:25:18] on yourself, some of the bad things he's
[1:25:20] making you pay for something.
[1:25:23] In all things, give thanks.
[1:25:27] BUT THAT HAS NOT ONE THING TO DO WITH
[1:25:30] YOUR SALVATION.
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; THE FACT listen saints, you may have
[1:25:35] done something really bad. Maybe you
[1:25:37] killed someone and you have to go to
[1:25:39] jail. Yeah.
[1:25:43] You go to jail. You get beat up in jail.
[1:25:47] You stand your ground there. You learn
[1:25:49] your lesson. You be the bride of Christ
[1:25:51] in jail.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I'm just giving you like
[1:25:56] the maximum thing. I hope you never kill
[1:25:58] anyone.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? BUT WHATEVER IT IS, IF GOD HAS
[1:26:03] CHOSEN YOU FOR THAT, I KNOW of brothers
[1:26:06] who got allowed to go into prison so
[1:26:09] that he could use them there to spread
[1:26:11] the gospel. I've heard plenty of those
[1:26:14] stories, right?
[1:26:17] God can make you sick so you can spend
[1:26:19] one month or two months in a hospital in
[1:26:22] a hospital bed suffering with other
[1:26:24] people. While in your suffering, you are
[1:26:27] now talking to all these other people
[1:26:29] about the word.
[1:26:32] You're paying for something and you're
[1:26:34] continuing your purpose.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; This how it works with a child of God.
[1:26:39] Amen. In all things give thanks. You're
[1:26:42] a part of God. You're a son of God. When
[1:26:46] you're born in the spirit of God, you
[1:26:47] got eternal life and can no more die
[1:26:49] than God can die.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; You best stop BELIEVING THIS. YOU BEST
[1:26:54] START BELIEVING in the story of God and
[1:26:56] man.
[1:26:58] Embrace it.
[1:27:01] I was born of Brandom. He says, "You
[1:27:04] might make me some other name, some
[1:27:07] other name, but won't make me one less.
[1:27:10] I'm still Brandham. I was born Brham.
[1:27:12] Always will be Brandham. I may be so
[1:27:15] disfigured someday, drawed with
[1:27:17] arthritis, have a wreck, that's a car
[1:27:19] accident, or all tore up till I look an
[1:27:21] animal, but I'll still be a Brandham.
[1:27:24] Why? Brandom's bloods on the inside.
[1:27:27] [clears throat] What's he saying?
[1:27:30] I came into this world. He saved me. He
[1:27:33] gave me the Holy Ghost. He put his token
[1:27:35] upon me. His life, he revealed his word
[1:27:38] to me, opened the seals, and let me see
[1:27:39] it. I might break down. I might lose
[1:27:42] family members. I MIGHT HAVE CHILDREN
[1:27:44] BACKSLIDE. MY WIFE MIGHT leave me. I
[1:27:47] might end up all dead and withered
[1:27:49] looking and funny and everyone rejecting
[1:27:51] me. It doesn't take away the promise.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; No matter what I end up looking like,
[1:27:57] there's still his blood that's in me.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying. No matter what
[1:28:01] happens to us in life, because we have
[1:28:03] his life in us, we will we will
[1:28:05] certainly fulfill his word and bring
[1:28:07] forth the purpose he chose us for. He
[1:28:10] will not he will not compromise that
[1:28:13] behavior. Right? A son of God will not
[1:28:16] compromise that behavior. In this
[1:28:17] generation, you have to have the right
[1:28:19] behavior because it will be revealed by
[1:28:22] him through his word.
[1:28:26] Let's let's cut out all the noise. You
[1:28:29] can't be the bride and have the behavior
[1:28:32] of denomination. Yes,
[1:28:35] [clears throat]
[1:28:36] &gt;&gt; that's that's not the behavior of the
[1:28:38] gene seed of this day. You you you find
[1:28:42] it happening now in the message where
[1:28:43] message people want to go back to the
[1:28:45] behavior of denomination.
[1:28:47] And I I don't just mean the way they
[1:28:49] sing and worship. I mean literally in
[1:28:51] their minds they're becoming organized
[1:28:53] religion again.
[1:28:56] You can't do that. The theme of this
[1:28:58] message that the prophet taught was this
[1:29:01] particular thing. He was trying to tell
[1:29:03] people that organized religion will
[1:29:05] never be right and never help the elect
[1:29:09] find the right predestinated behavior.
[1:29:12] In other words, let's let's make it all
[1:29:14] plain. If you're if you have organized
[1:29:17] religion, you'll never wake up thinking,
[1:29:20] I need to build that ark.
[1:29:23] You got your own idea. If you have
[1:29:25] organized religion as your guiding
[1:29:28] nature, you'll never wake up in the
[1:29:30] morning thinking, I need to kill Goliath
[1:29:33] or I need to take God's people across to
[1:29:35] the promised land or I need to protect
[1:29:38] God's throne or I need to, you know,
[1:29:43] I want to ask you
[1:29:45] because my wife and I ask ourselves this
[1:29:47] all the time. You know, we we bluff
[1:29:51] ourselves. We delude ourselves. We go
[1:29:54] for coffee and dessert. We go away for
[1:29:58] our anniversary and we go to have a
[1:30:00] break
[1:30:02] and we go there and we try to unwind
[1:30:07] and uh we even get out in nature where
[1:30:09] there's no cell phones and Wi-Fi network
[1:30:12] and then we sitting on this table and
[1:30:14] our conversation comes back to the
[1:30:15] condition this world is in.
[1:30:19] Sometimes I ask what is WRONG WITH US?
[1:30:22] WHY ARE we concerned with THE BEHAVIOR
[1:30:25] OF OTHER PEOPLE? Why can we not get it
[1:30:28] out of US TO JUST LIKE SHUT IT OUT AND
[1:30:30] just have peace?
[1:30:33] No, we just can't get out of us, can we?
[1:30:36] Because that's that gene seed inside.
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; It's egging at you.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; It It's making you concerned.
[1:30:45] It's making you cry out for the
[1:30:47] abominations of the city.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; you can try to run from it. Every time
[1:30:51] you see something, you read something,
[1:30:53] you see some clip on something on
[1:30:55] YouTube, it's it's it's drawing your
[1:30:58] attention to the sin that is mounting in
[1:31:00] the world and it's drawing your
[1:31:02] conversation. There's something inside
[1:31:04] you thinking, "What can I do?
[1:31:07] What must we do? What do we do to
[1:31:10] prevent this from happening to our
[1:31:11] children? HOW DO WE KEEP THIS OUT OF OUR
[1:31:13] CHURCH? HOW DO WE KEEP THE word pure?"
[1:31:16] Like,
[1:31:18] who died and made you God?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; There's an answer for that, right?
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Like, what makes you think you can save
[1:31:29] the world?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; What makes you think you can even do it
[1:31:32] one soul at A TIME? WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
[1:31:35] THAT BECAUSE of the way you live,
[1:31:36] there'll be salvation for mankind?
[1:31:39] Are you a narcissist?
[1:31:42] [clears throat]
[1:31:43] What makes you Why CAN YOU NOT GET THAT
[1:31:45] OUT OF YOUR BEING? WHY ARE YOU LETTING
[1:31:48] it drive your work, your school, your
[1:31:51] life? WHY ARE YOU PRAYING TO GOD? Why
[1:31:54] are you read the Bible? Why are you
[1:31:56] READING THE MESSAGE? WHY DON'T YOU JUST
[1:31:58] GO MAKE as much money as all those other
[1:32:00] people and and HAVE A A BLAST OF A PARTY
[1:32:03] OF A LIFE UNTIL YOU breathe your last
[1:32:05] breath and then you can die thinking,
[1:32:07] "Yes, I did everything. I spent every
[1:32:11] SCENT AND I ENJOYED IT."
[1:32:14] WHY CAN'T YOU JUST be that?
[1:32:17] No, you're concerned with the world and
[1:32:20] the way they're acting and the way the
[1:32:22] the the country is going, the way the
[1:32:24] world at large is is behaving and what's
[1:32:27] happening to the youth and what's
[1:32:28] happening to the universities, what's
[1:32:29] happening to the children and and you're
[1:32:32] going out there and you're doing stuff
[1:32:33] with the public and you're trying to
[1:32:34] change things. Why
[1:32:43] paragraph 97 adoption part three why I
[1:32:46] stood not long ago by the grave of a man
[1:32:48] great man a great reformer and I thought
[1:32:50] what a great man he was it was John
[1:32:52] Wesley and I thought if John Wesley
[1:32:55] could rise from this grave today and see
[1:32:57] the condition of his church he'd be
[1:32:59] ashamed of his name
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; John Wesley was a godly man a fire brand
[1:33:04] snatched as he called it. John Wesley
[1:33:07] was a holy man who lived in God,
[1:33:09] believed in God, and walked step by step
[1:33:11] after him.
[1:33:15] [clears throat]
[1:33:17] Yeah. Uh but after John died, they said,
[1:33:21] "We'll make a church to John so we'll
[1:33:23] have a church and we'll call it
[1:33:24] Methodist church because of his method
[1:33:26] of sanctification being the second work
[1:33:28] of grace."
[1:33:30] Then they made a church and today them
[1:33:32] church men deny everything that John
[1:33:34] Wesley stood for.
[1:33:37] John Wesley preached divine healing.
[1:33:39] John Wesley believed in the baptism of
[1:33:41] the spirit. John Wesley believed in all
[1:33:43] the restoration of the gifts. John
[1:33:45] Wesley, Martin Luther, many of those
[1:33:47] great men spoke in tongues and
[1:33:48] interpreted. And today you speak in
[1:33:50] tongues in a Methodist church or
[1:33:52] Lutheran church that kick you out the
[1:33:53] door.
[1:33:55] What's the matter? Right in the time
[1:33:58] where we ought to be placing sons, what
[1:34:00] is the matter? They have adopted
[1:34:02] something else because they don't know
[1:34:05] the mystery of God.
[1:34:09] Stop. Wake up. Don't miss it. They've
[1:34:14] adopted something else because they
[1:34:17] don't know the mystery of God.
[1:34:20] They'll know it. They'll never know it
[1:34:23] through a seminary.
[1:34:26] He was speaking this in 1960, not
[1:34:29] realizing
[1:34:31] 65 years later the very same thing would
[1:34:35] be said about him.
[1:34:38] William Brham.
[1:34:40] So I'll say it. If William Brham rose
[1:34:43] from the grave to see what is being done
[1:34:45] in his name today, he would be ashamed
[1:34:48] of his name.
[1:34:52] There are many things taught in his name
[1:34:55] that are not the things he stood for.
[1:35:01] Making cults,
[1:35:04] subjugating people like slaves,
[1:35:08] ruling people's lives by force of
[1:35:11] terror, of supernatural terror.
[1:35:15] forcing people into behaviors and things
[1:35:17] and doctrines that are not in congruent
[1:35:22] then they are not congruent with what he
[1:35:23] taught not even in THE SAME SPIRIT NOT
[1:35:26] EVEN IN THE SAME humility
[1:35:32] right in the time I'll I'll use his
[1:35:34] words right in the time where we ought
[1:35:37] to be placing sons what is the matter
[1:35:41] they have adopted something else because
[1:35:43] they don't know the mystery of God.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:35:50] Amen.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; But saints, the word has come down.
[1:35:56] You know, I
[1:35:59] I don't know what it was like to be that
[1:36:01] prophet.
[1:36:03] But I can tell you from what I read, I
[1:36:05] remember once preaching the message to
[1:36:07] you when we started the series on the
[1:36:08] seven thunders. I preached something.
[1:36:11] Did I call it the prophet in distress?
[1:36:14] or something. What was it called?
[1:36:17] Something to that effect. But I remember
[1:36:21] running through the mindset of the
[1:36:23] prophet leading up to the seventh seal
[1:36:26] after receiving that that vision. Insist
[1:36:30] the time
[1:36:32] and the turmoil. Was it turmoil? in
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; the prophet in turmoil.
[1:36:37] And it literally was turmoil because
[1:36:39] from the word go of that vision, he
[1:36:42] couldn't figure out what God wanted for
[1:36:44] him to do. He he actually thought he was
[1:36:46] going to die
[1:36:49] and he heard he saw this blast and all
[1:36:51] that and he's thinking, is it the
[1:36:52] thunders? Is it this? Is it that? And he
[1:36:55] went through turmoil. And then he goes
[1:36:57] through January and February and March
[1:36:59] and then he comes to preach the seventh
[1:37:01] seal. And look at the things he's got to
[1:37:04] say.
[1:37:07] I mean, can you imagine me saying today?
[1:37:10] Me.
[1:37:12] Okay, I'm going to say this.
[1:37:15] It's time to say everything.
[1:37:19] Especially for my legalist brothers all
[1:37:21] over the world who say, "Say what the
[1:37:24] tape says.
[1:37:27] SAY ONLY WHAT DO NOT ADD or take away.
[1:37:31] [snorts]
[1:37:31] Can you show me one quote where brother
[1:37:34] Brandham says I am the seventh
[1:37:37] messenger?
[1:37:39] [cough and clears throat]
[1:37:41] Can you show me one quote where he says
[1:37:43] I am the forerunner.
[1:37:46] I am the Elijah.
[1:37:50] [clears throat]
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; So why do you believe that?
[1:37:55] Are you adding to the word?
[1:38:00] Oh, no. You got a revelation. Oh, that's
[1:38:03] convenient.
[1:38:05] Now it's convenient
[1:38:07] because you're not saying what the tape
[1:38:08] says.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Even those press PLAY TAPE GUYS. THEY'RE
[1:38:12] ALSO SAYING HE'S ELIJAH. He's a
[1:38:14] forerunner. HE'S THE PROPHET. HE'S THIS.
[1:38:16] WHERE does he say that?
[1:38:20] Everywhere he talks, HE SPEAKS LIKE JOHN
[1:38:22] THE BAPTIST. when that seventh angel we
[1:38:25] know he will DO THIS WHEN THAT ELIJAH
[1:38:27] EVEN SAYS IN some place he's Christ.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; So what did you guys add to it?
[1:38:35] Because now you're saying he's the
[1:38:36] seventh messenger and he didn't say it.
[1:38:39] OH, HE SAID SOMETHING TO ALLUDE TO IT
[1:38:41] that he is but he didn't say it. You
[1:38:45] legalist.
[1:38:48] You see this is a problem.
[1:38:50] Now when you when you take that and you
[1:38:52] go back to all the THINGS HE HAD TO SAY
[1:38:55] in the seventh seal like saying the
[1:38:57] seventh angel is on earth at the time of
[1:39:00] this coming.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; So those fellas who are legalists about
[1:39:05] what he said
[1:39:08] if
[1:39:10] if
[1:39:11] he is coming has not happened yet that
[1:39:14] means he's not talking about the seventh
[1:39:16] angel that is him. He's talking about
[1:39:18] the seven trumpeting angel. So we can
[1:39:21] now twist the words to be legalistic
[1:39:24] about that. In the meantime, can you
[1:39:26] imagine the weight on him to have to say
[1:39:31] that he is a son of man revealing the
[1:39:34] son of man and the full revealed to him
[1:39:37] under the seventh seal is that he is
[1:39:39] speaking for the lamb.
[1:39:42] Would you have the guts to say that?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; How would you say that?
[1:39:49] That's why I'm saying the pressure. I
[1:39:52] just thank God it's not me.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; That's how I feel.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; I'm just happy to be me, Lord. To have
[1:40:00] that pressure and to have to say that
[1:40:03] where by the end of the series, he even
[1:40:05] says, "I'm going to lose 10,000 of my
[1:40:09] friends
[1:40:10] because of this. I'm going to lose my
[1:40:14] friends. Doors are going to be closed.
[1:40:17] to me.
[1:40:21] Don't worry, brothers. Let it thunder.
[1:40:23] It's fine.
[1:40:26] The word has come down, saints, and made
[1:40:28] a new unconditional covenant. Do you
[1:40:30] know in this dispensation of the
[1:40:32] fullness of times is the last
[1:40:34] unconditional covenant?
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; That is made.
[1:40:42] Oh, you're going to love this.
[1:40:45] Revelations 10:4-7. So you know in
[1:40:48] Revelations 10 1-3, right?
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; And a mighty angel descends from heaven
[1:40:52] in a cloud and a rainbow about his head
[1:40:54] and and uh his face like the sun, right?
[1:40:59] And verse four says, are everyone awake?
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I I know your eyes are open. I mean, are
[1:41:06] you awake? Okay.
[1:41:08] When the seven thunders uttered their
[1:41:10] voices, I was about to write. Who's the
[1:41:13] eye? It's John. John is a type of the
[1:41:16] believer.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; And I heard a voice from heaven saying
[1:41:19] unto me, "Seal up those things which the
[1:41:22] seven thunders uttered and write them
[1:41:24] not." That means don't reveal it yet.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; That's what sealing up means. Like when
[1:41:31] it says in Daniel, "Seal up the words,
[1:41:34] Daniel, unto the end."
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; It means don't reveal it, right? Don't
[1:41:41] interpret it. Don't tell them what it
[1:41:42] means. That is ceiling.
[1:41:46] And the angel which I saw stand upon the
[1:41:48] sea and upon the earth lifted up his
[1:41:50] hand to heaven. By the way, this is
[1:41:53] where the courts get it from. Raise your
[1:41:55] hand. Place your hand in the Bible
[1:41:59] because raising the hand was a symbol of
[1:42:01] something. What? Swearing an oath.
[1:42:04] Making a covenant
[1:42:07] and swear by him. Okay. [clears throat]
[1:42:11] Little children in South Africa, don't
[1:42:14] tell me the angel swore.
[1:42:17] Okay? Because in South Africa, swearing
[1:42:19] here is cursing. This is not cursing.
[1:42:22] This swearing is making a promise. So he
[1:42:27] raised his hand and made a promise. He
[1:42:30] made a covenant. He swore an oath,
[1:42:34] right? And then he swore by him that
[1:42:37] liveth forever and ever. Brother
[1:42:39] Brandham says, "Because there was none
[1:42:41] higher than him to swear by, he swore by
[1:42:44] himself."
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? When people make
[1:42:48] covenants or sign contracts, they need a
[1:42:51] guarantor.
[1:42:53] You know what's a guarantor?
[1:42:55] In case your word fails, someone else
[1:42:58] pays your debt,
[1:43:01] right? That's a guarantor. So, uh, if
[1:43:04] you swear by something, you got to swear
[1:43:06] by something reliable.
[1:43:09] Right? Like some of you fellas, Indian
[1:43:11] fellows who swear by your mother.
[1:43:15] [clears throat]
[1:43:16] Right? Do not do that. We actually have
[1:43:19] a scripture in Christ that says that do
[1:43:21] not swear by your mother or your father.
[1:43:23] Do not swear by heaven nor by earth.
[1:43:25] None of those things belong to you. It's
[1:43:27] not going to back you up. Do not swear
[1:43:30] by anything. With Christ, he says, "Do
[1:43:32] not swear by anything. Let your yay be
[1:43:34] yay and your nay be nay." So you don't
[1:43:36] have to make any promises.
[1:43:38] Right? But he has to come and make a
[1:43:40] covenant because we are unbelieving,
[1:43:44] untrusting people,
[1:43:47] nervous, suspicious people. THAT'S WHY
[1:43:50] GOD IS TO COME MAKE COVENANTS. Like when
[1:43:51] he came and made a promise, Abraham
[1:43:53] would say, "How shall I know? How shall
[1:43:56] I know that I will receive this?" And
[1:43:58] then God is to produce something to make
[1:44:00] a promise. Are you with us? Okay, we
[1:44:03] closing now. We're coming to the end.
[1:44:06] So the angel descends. He raises his
[1:44:09] right hand. He swears by him that liveth
[1:44:12] forever and ever. And look at the
[1:44:13] things. And who created heaven
[1:44:16] [clears throat] and the things that are
[1:44:18] in heaven.
[1:44:20] No. Amens.
[1:44:22] And earth and the things that are in
[1:44:24] earth and the sea and the things which
[1:44:27] are therein which is still earth. And
[1:44:30] that there should be time no longer.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's making a covenant. He's
[1:44:37] making a promise. He's swearing by the
[1:44:40] highest oath of authority OF OATHS
[1:44:44] THAT THERE SHOULD BE TIME NO LONGER.
[1:44:47] Everyone got that?
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Oh great. What what kind of promise is
[1:44:51] that? It's going to be no more time.
[1:44:54] Thank you.
[1:44:56] No verse seven,
[1:45:00] right? Verse seven is the actual thing.
[1:45:03] Looks like I didn't put it here in the
[1:45:04] notes.
[1:45:07] This is the oath that in the days of the
[1:45:10] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[1:45:13] begin to sound
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; the what?
[1:45:19] The mystery of God
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; which they did not know.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; THEY ADOPTED SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE they
[1:45:27] didn't know the mystery of God. THE
[1:45:31] MYSTERY OF GOD should be finished.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; AS HE HATH DECLARED TO HIS SERVANTS THE
[1:45:36] PROPHETS, SAINTS, follow the mystery.
[1:45:39] The angel descends with the open book in
[1:45:41] his hand. He places one foot on the
[1:45:43] land, one in the sea. He cries with a
[1:45:45] loud voice. Seven thunders utter their
[1:45:47] voices
[1:45:49] not interpreted because there's a
[1:45:51] message that needs to be received. Then
[1:45:53] he commands that what the seven thunders
[1:45:55] uttered should not be made known or
[1:45:57] revealed or interpreted. IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:45:59] THERE'S SOMETHING OUTSTANDING that needs
[1:46:01] to be revealed.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; So, he raises his hand and swears
[1:46:06] [clears throat]
[1:46:06] that everything that should not be
[1:46:08] revealed is going to be fulfilled when
[1:46:11] the seventh ANGEL IS GIVING OUT HIS
[1:46:13] MESSAGE, THE MYSTERY OF GOD SHOULD BE
[1:46:16] FINISHED.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; He references the name he swears by,
[1:46:20] that is him that liveth forever and
[1:46:22] ever, who created heaven and earth AND
[1:46:25] ALL THINGS. WHO'S THAT? Sunday school,
[1:46:29] the logos. [snorts] He's referencing the
[1:46:32] logos,
[1:46:34] right? The word where the story of God
[1:46:36] and man began. HE SAYS, "AND WHO CREATED
[1:46:39] everything in heaven and in earth and in
[1:46:41] the sea in the ancient ways of swearing
[1:46:44] oaths and covenants." This is one what
[1:46:46] one had to do. Raise your right hand and
[1:46:48] swear by someone higher than you. We
[1:46:52] know because the very next chapter
[1:46:55] details when he says time shall be no
[1:46:58] more. It's not the ending of time
[1:47:01] because the next chapter says there's
[1:47:02] three and a half years left.
[1:47:04] &gt;&gt; Time times and half a time left for the
[1:47:08] Jews. He's not talking about time
[1:47:10] ending. He's talking about dispensation.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; THE DISPENSATION is ending.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; TIME SHALL BE NO MORE. SO WHAT COVENANT
[1:47:20] DOES he make? That is verse seven. That
[1:47:23] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:47:24] angel, the mystery of God should be
[1:47:27] finished. As declared by the prophets of
[1:47:30] all the other dispensations.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; This is the dispensation of the fullness
[1:47:36] of time. This is beautiful. Let's read.
[1:47:38] Is this a sign of the end, sir? Okay. He
[1:47:41] begins by reading a scripture. The book
[1:47:43] that is written within is then completed
[1:47:46] and all these mysteries have finished to
[1:47:47] be sounded. Now, let me read it again.
[1:47:50] So you will be sure. Now look, there it
[1:47:52] is. In the days of the voice of the
[1:47:55] seventh angel, he says, "Last angel."
[1:48:01] This is where the bride needs to wake up
[1:48:03] and and understand who's he talking
[1:48:05] about. He's saying me without saying it.
[1:48:10] When he shall begin to sound, the
[1:48:12] mystery of God should be finished. Now,
[1:48:15] what is the mystery of God? Are you
[1:48:18] ready?
[1:48:19] One of them Paul said in 1 Timothy 3, I
[1:48:22] believe it was said without controversy,
[1:48:24] great is the mystery of godliness. What
[1:48:26] is the mystery of God? For God was
[1:48:29] manifested in the flesh.
[1:48:33] He is now defining the mystery of God.
[1:48:36] God manifested in the flesh. We handled
[1:48:40] him. We seed him. Received him up into
[1:48:42] glory. Witnessed by angels. Vindicated
[1:48:45] here on earth. God was
[1:48:50] [cough and clears throat] what is the
[1:48:51] mystery of God?
[1:48:53] God manifested in flesh.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; That was the mystery rejected in the
[1:48:58] time of Christ. That is the mystery
[1:49:00] rejected under the seventh seal. That is
[1:49:02] the mystery being rejected now. THEY
[1:49:04] ADOPTED SOMETHING ELSE CUZ THEY don't
[1:49:07] know the mystery of God.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sure,
[1:49:12] it's a great mystery, but it's all
[1:49:14] solved.
[1:49:16] Not father, son, and holy ghost, three
[1:49:18] gods, but one God in three offices. The
[1:49:21] father under Moses, the sunship under
[1:49:24] Christ, the Holy Ghost under this
[1:49:26] dispensation, three dispensations of the
[1:49:29] same God, not three gods. The mystery is
[1:49:33] finished now. THE BIBLE SAID it should
[1:49:37] be.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:40] I don't want to talk on a mystery of God
[1:49:42] because I've done it already. How many
[1:49:44] of you remember the message I preached
[1:49:46] called the purpose of the message 2013
[1:49:49] 2014 somewhere? You remember that? I
[1:49:51] went through all these dispensations and
[1:49:53] we showed you that scripture where it
[1:49:55] says the the mystery of God and he
[1:49:58] speaks of the father, the word, the holy
[1:50:01] spirit. You remember we did all the
[1:50:03] dispensations, right? The purpose of the
[1:50:05] message. So I'm not going to go into
[1:50:07] that. We have covered that sufficiently
[1:50:10] in the seventh seal. The mystery of the
[1:50:12] book sealed with seven seals. But this
[1:50:15] is the final covenant. SAINTS, LET'S
[1:50:18] WAKE UP. THIS IS THE FINAL COVENANT
[1:50:22] under this dispensation
[1:50:25] IN THE FULLNESS OF TIMES. The
[1:50:27] dispensation OF THE FULLNESS OF TIMES.
[1:50:30] This is your covenant that the mystery
[1:50:32] of God SHOULD BE FINISHED. I'M saying to
[1:50:35] you, don't be like people who read
[1:50:38] things on a surface level. What does it
[1:50:41] mean? Like what does Mrs. Jesus mean?
[1:50:43] I'm asking you, what does the mystery of
[1:50:46] God mean?
[1:50:48] Don't point to Jesus. Don't point to the
[1:50:51] prophet
[1:50:53] YOUR DAY. WHAT IS the mystery of God?
[1:50:56] What is God manifested in flesh? Which
[1:51:00] flesh?
[1:51:01] What flesh? When is that going to
[1:51:04] happen?
[1:51:06] This is the final covenant. I'm saying
[1:51:09] to you, every other covenant was not
[1:51:12] completed because the people failed.
[1:51:16] This is the DISPENSATION OF THE FULLNESS
[1:51:18] OF ALL COVENANTS.
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; THERE WILL BE NO FAILURE BECAUSE THERE'S
[1:51:23] NO MORE DISPENSATION TO COMPLETE THIS
[1:51:26] MYSTERY. You are the ones chosen TO
[1:51:29] COMPLETE THE STORY OF GOD AND MAN,
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; the mystery of God MADE FLESH TODAY. YOU
[1:51:36] ARE THE ONES CHOSEN. IT'S YOUR STRUGGLE,
[1:51:40] your trial to come to that acceptance.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; What those seven thunders uttered is
[1:51:48] unsealed in our day. It is unveiled. It
[1:51:51] is revealed.
[1:51:53] It is all coming together in Christ in
[1:51:56] one. It is heaven and earth embracing
[1:51:59] two dimensions becoming one. Theophony
[1:52:02] is coming together
[1:52:04] WITH THE FLESHLY BODIES. IT'S HAPPENING
[1:52:07] TO GLORIFY THE FLESH. ALL PREDESTINATED
[1:52:10] ATTRIBUTES BOTH WHICH ARE IN HEAVEN,
[1:52:12] those which are in earth are coming
[1:52:14] together completing the mystery of God.
[1:52:16] We have been chosen for this
[1:52:18] dispensation.
[1:52:19] Many people will falter, many will fail,
[1:52:22] but those who are chosen will not fail.
[1:52:27] They will reach their adoption. We will
[1:52:29] find our positions in Christ. This
[1:52:31] dispensation is the ushering in of the
[1:52:34] millennium.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; THERE CAN BE NO MILLENNIUM if this
[1:52:38] dispensation of THE FULLNESS OF TIMES
[1:52:40] DID NOT HAPPEN FIRST.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; WE HAD TO BRING ALL THINGS IN CHRIST IN
[1:52:45] HEAVEN AND IN EARTH TOGETHER before all
[1:52:47] THINGS IN CHRIST CAN BE TOGETHER IN
[1:52:49] flesh in uh for for a thousand years for
[1:52:53] the millennium. Amen.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; This is his purpose for us in the
[1:52:57] dispensation of the fullness of times.
[1:52:59] In closing, the last quote,
[1:53:02] he's reading uh Ephesians 1, the
[1:53:06] mysteries of his will according to his
[1:53:07] good pleasure. Back over now again in
[1:53:09] Ephesians 9 uh which he has purposed in
[1:53:12] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:53:14] fullness of times. And remember that we
[1:53:17] just passed over it Ephesians 1st 10th
[1:53:20] verse that in the dispensation of the
[1:53:22] fullness of time. Now we learned that
[1:53:24] the fullness of time
[1:53:26] uh the time that that when sin will
[1:53:29] cease.
[1:53:31] The fullness of time is waiting for
[1:53:32] what? The fullness of all time. The time
[1:53:35] when sin uh will cease. The time when
[1:53:38] death will cease. The time when sickness
[1:53:40] will cease. THE TIME WHEN SIN will
[1:53:41] cease. THE TIME WHEN ALL PERVERSIONS AND
[1:53:44] PERVERTED things that the devil has
[1:53:46] perverted will cease. When time itself
[1:53:48] shall cease. You know this is a
[1:53:50] beautiful thing. I taught you once
[1:53:52] before. God took Israel, allowed them to
[1:53:56] go to Egypt in a famine and kept them
[1:53:59] there 400 years while the fullness of
[1:54:02] the Amorites is fulfilled.
[1:54:05] When it's fulfilled, he then takes them
[1:54:07] out, plagues that place to chase them
[1:54:10] out AND GO FULFILL THEIR PURPOSE TO
[1:54:13] CLEANSE the land of the Amorites.
[1:54:18] This where you are. You and I could not
[1:54:21] complete
[1:54:23] completely overcome sin unless sin comes
[1:54:26] to its maximum, right?
[1:54:29] [snorts]
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; You have to fight it.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:37] in the year in the 1970s
[1:54:41] with all the Woodstock and LSD and drugs
[1:54:44] and
[1:54:46] cannabis smoking hippies who grew out
[1:54:49] their beards and their hair and dressed
[1:54:52] crazy with dyed clothes and sang weird
[1:54:56] songs and save the world and make love
[1:55:00] not war and you know they were all I
[1:55:05] and we thought that was sinful
[1:55:09] and then the 80s came
[1:55:11] and then you had one of the first stars
[1:55:14] of Hollywood die of AIDS
[1:55:17] and the world Christian world went into
[1:55:20] you know slap bang against homosexuality
[1:55:24] and AIDS being caused by homosexuality.
[1:55:28] Nobody back then I was living then in
[1:55:30] the 80s. Nobody back then would imagine
[1:55:33] what the world was going to be like now.
[1:55:37] Then the '9s came and we thought, "Yeah,
[1:55:40] it can't get any worse than this."
[1:55:42] And then everyone thought the world was
[1:55:44] going to end in 2000. You remember the
[1:55:46] whole Y2K thing and they were stocking
[1:55:49] up cans of beans and you know what? Oh,
[1:55:53] everything was going to switch, you
[1:55:54] know, to [snorts] 2000 and the zeros. I
[1:55:57] don't know what the zeros were going to
[1:55:58] do, but they were going to crash the
[1:55:59] whole world systems and we're ALL GOING
[1:56:01] TO DIE. I REMEMBER I WAS WORKING AT
[1:56:04] Eskim at the time. Eskim was planning
[1:56:07] for Y2K, setting all their systems and
[1:56:09] when it switches over on all the zeros,
[1:56:12] nothing happened.
[1:56:16] Nothing happened. That year 2001, the
[1:56:21] World Trade Center came down in a
[1:56:24] terrorist attack and then all the
[1:56:26] systems of the world world trade came
[1:56:28] crashing down. From there on when all
[1:56:31] these look like cloak and dagger stuff,
[1:56:34] you know, with with economies and
[1:56:36] insuranceances and investments and banks
[1:56:38] and we went through these decades and
[1:56:41] everyone's thinking, how much worse can
[1:56:43] it get?
[1:56:45] If you think of sexual immorality,
[1:56:49] you
[1:56:51] you people are living under an illusion.
[1:56:56] If if you have only an inkling of an
[1:56:58] idea, I cannot even speak it across this
[1:57:00] pulpit because it's so bad
[1:57:02] to tell you what is there.
[1:57:08] I spoke to a
[1:57:11] a young
[1:57:13] message youth who [snorts] said to me,
[1:57:16] "Brother Alistister, it is not fair what
[1:57:20] has been put in our hands.
[1:57:23] It is not fair to me in this message
[1:57:26] today to have access to the things I
[1:57:29] have access to.
[1:57:31] [crying]
[1:57:33] It is not fair." He said, "If you guys
[1:57:35] thought you were dealing with things in
[1:57:36] your your time," he said, "what's
[1:57:38] happening to us, it is not fair.
[1:57:43] [snorts]
[1:57:44] I'm going to say something that he
[1:57:46] said."
[1:57:48] He said, "A young person, a young child
[1:57:52] in America today," he's from America. He
[1:57:54] was talking to me from he said to me, "A
[1:57:56] young boy, teenager
[1:57:59] in 10 minutes
[1:58:02] using his cell phone would see more
[1:58:05] naked women in full HD than an English
[1:58:09] king in his whole lifetime."
[1:58:14] Those were his words to me.
[1:58:18] He's right. He said in 10 minutes
[1:58:23] if you think of the amount of scrolling
[1:58:25] you do on your cell phone and the amount
[1:58:26] of stuff you consume on the internet
[1:58:29] today and what our kids what I'm trying
[1:58:32] to tell you is if you thought you were
[1:58:33] ready to meet the rapture in the 80s or
[1:58:35] the '9s you were deluded.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Sin had the Amorites had not even come
[1:58:41] to its fullness yet.
[1:58:44] So my friends, my brothers and sisters,
[1:58:48] my young people,
[1:58:51] Sunday school youth, this is your trial.
[1:58:55] I don't care how hard it is.
[1:58:58] You have to face it. You have to battle
[1:59:01] it. You have to beat it. I don't care
[1:59:05] how unfair it is to your generation.
[1:59:08] Those people who are being fed to lions
[1:59:11] must have been saying the same thing.
[1:59:13] It's unfair to me that I'm being fed to
[1:59:16] the lions.
[1:59:18] I'm not This young boy was not saying
[1:59:20] this in a way to me that was
[1:59:21] complaining. He was trying to bring me
[1:59:24] to the understanding that our generation
[1:59:26] of adults does not have the full
[1:59:29] comprehension
[1:59:31] of the the issue that the youth today
[1:59:34] face.
[1:59:36] And to me, I've got ministers shooting
[1:59:38] me in the back while I'm trying to bring
[1:59:41] them to the idea of what is going on.
[1:59:44] They [snorts] don't even want to talk
[1:59:45] about it. I've got ministers who say
[1:59:48] their wives can't hear the message I
[1:59:50] preached on sexuality cuz it's too much
[1:59:51] for them. They blush at it.
[1:59:56] And I spoke those things in a way that
[1:59:59] is even diplomatic.
[2:00:01] It's not even what your children are
[2:00:04] seeing. I mean, if your wife blushes at
[2:00:06] what I said, she'll just have a coronery
[2:00:08] and die.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you, stop being such
[2:00:13] pruds.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Stop acting like it doesn't exist. STOP
[2:00:17] ACTING LIKE YOU CAN'T TALK about it.
[2:00:19] Stop acting LIKE YOU'RE SO HOLY that it
[2:00:21] doesn't happen in your generation or in
[2:00:23] your own house.
[2:00:26] Don't walk around like ostriches with
[2:00:28] your head stuck in the sand.
[2:00:30] Don't for one second think your child is
[2:00:33] not exposed to it. YOU'RE A FOOL IF YOU
[2:00:35] think so.
[2:00:40] And just because you can take them to
[2:00:41] camps and get them to to receive some
[2:00:45] Holy Ghost anointing and shout and
[2:00:47] scream and run around and think, "Ah, we
[2:00:49] did our job. We did our job. You know,
[2:00:53] now the Holy Ghost can take it from
[2:00:54] here." No, parents,
[2:00:58] no. THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. You're
[2:01:01] going to have to fight this.
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; YES,
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING to have to fight this.
[2:01:07] And look, half of it is not my battle.
[2:01:11] I don't have the time to go surfing for
[2:01:13] pornography on the internet. It's It's
[2:01:14] not going to happen for me. It's not
[2:01:16] even my fight. I don't even have 10
[2:01:19] minutes to to look around for naked
[2:01:21] women.
[2:01:22] I got barely 10 minutes for myself. I
[2:01:24] can't even get time to to exercise. got
[2:01:27] a hurting back because they don't
[2:01:28] exercise.
[2:01:30] But you have got time on your hand. You
[2:01:32] have got idle minds. You young minds are
[2:01:36] getting involved in all these things.
[2:01:38] There are games, there are computer
[2:01:40] games, there's pornography, there's
[2:01:42] scrolling on THE INTERNET, ALL THE STUFF
[2:01:43] YOU DO. Let me tell you what happens
[2:01:46] when you have a spirit that is not
[2:01:48] centered on the word. It poisons your
[2:01:51] entire being.
[2:01:54] You cannot tell me that if you're you're
[2:01:57] reading one book for a whole year while
[2:02:01] YOU'RE CONSUMING ALL THE internet
[2:02:05] &gt;&gt; that you'll have a spirit that can fight
[2:02:07] this fight.
[2:02:12] No, it's not happening.
[2:02:17] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[2:02:19] of time that he might gather together in
[2:02:21] one all things in Christ, both which are
[2:02:22] in heaven and earth, which are on earth,
[2:02:25] even in him. Gather all things in
[2:02:29] Christ. As I said this morning, all the
[2:02:32] little nuggets that we find, these great
[2:02:34] little things, you can polish them in
[2:02:36] Genesis, you can polish them in Exodus,
[2:02:39] you can polish them in Leviticus, you
[2:02:41] can bring them up in Revelations,
[2:02:43] they'll end up being Jesus.
[2:02:46] Can you see that?
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; All the covenants,
[2:02:50] no matter what, you can polish them up,
[2:02:52] they will end up in Jesus. Right? You
[2:02:54] take Joseph, you take Abraham, you take
[2:02:56] Isaac, you take Jacob, you take David,
[2:02:59] you take any of those nuggets, those men
[2:03:00] of God, and see if they don't see Jesus
[2:03:03] displayed in each one of them that he
[2:03:05] might gather all things into one Christ
[2:03:09] Jesus.
[2:03:11] It's all going to come to this time at
[2:03:14] the end. All those that were written of
[2:03:17] in the Bible were displaying earthly
[2:03:20] attributes of the word in every
[2:03:23] dispensation. But it all comes back to
[2:03:25] Christ in the end. What is Christ? The
[2:03:28] mystery of God revealed. What is the
[2:03:31] mystery of God? The word manifested in
[2:03:34] flesh.
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; The logos and all those ATTRIBUTES THAT
[2:03:37] WERE IN THE FOUNDATION IN THE FOUNTAIN
[2:03:39] of life manifested in flesh today. All
[2:03:42] that was in the logos before the
[2:03:43] foundation of the world in the beginning
[2:03:45] of the story of God a man is now
[2:03:47] manifested according to the pleasure of
[2:03:50] his own will. Manifested in the flesh
[2:03:52] through Jesus Christ. ALL THOSE
[2:03:54] ATTRIBUTES WERE CHOSEN TO BE manifested
[2:03:56] in the flesh. To do what? To combat the
[2:04:00] evil for their day. To fight back
[2:04:03] against the lies of that time. To bring
[2:04:06] restoration to mankind in their time.
[2:04:09] THERE IS NO difference to this day. YOU
[2:04:12] WILL NOT hear in the message to come to
[2:04:15] me churches and have a comfortable life
[2:04:18] and coast along while everything must go
[2:04:21] right for you. No. IF THE ATTRIBUTES HAD
[2:04:25] TO COMBAT sin in every GENERATION AND
[2:04:29] FIGHT THE GREATEST pharaohs and kings
[2:04:32] and rulers and empires AND THE MOST
[2:04:35] BLOODTHIRSTY EMPIRES THROUGH THE CHURCH
[2:04:37] AGES, THEN IN THIS DAY, what is a little
[2:04:40] bit of criticism? What is a LITTLE BIT
[2:04:42] OF BACKBITING AND SNIPING at you or
[2:04:45] people CALLING YOU NAMES? WHAT IS PEOPLE
[2:04:48] CALLING YOU CULTS? THAT'S NOT EVEN IT.
[2:04:51] THE STORY OF GOD IN MAN IS ABOUT GOD'S
[2:04:54] WORD BEING MANIFESTED IN FLESH. IT IS
[2:04:57] HERE FOR THE SALVATION OF MANKIND. It is
[2:04:59] here TO FULFILL THE PURPOSE THAT GOD
[2:05:01] created man for to be dominant TO TAKE
[2:05:06] DOMINION OVER ALL SIN. That's what we
[2:05:09] have been called for. The logos is
[2:05:12] heaven. He has brought brought forth
[2:05:15] sons like unto himself. Do you believe
[2:05:17] that?
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; The logos brought forth sons like unto
[2:05:20] himself. What was that? Theophanes.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; THEN THE WORD WAS MADE FLESH IN JESUS
[2:05:24] CHRIST. AND HE BROUGHT FORTH sons like
[2:05:26] unto himself.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; So you HAVE SONS BROUGHT FORTH LIKE UNTO
[2:05:29] HIMSELF IN HEAVEN AND IN EARTH WHO must
[2:05:32] come together.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; In the last dispensation of the fullness
[2:05:36] of times. Heaven and earth embracing
[2:05:38] theophony and flesh equals manifested
[2:05:41] sons. We are living at the end of the
[2:05:44] story.
[2:05:45] You are the end of the story
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; of God and man. You are the fulfillment
[2:05:50] of it. We went through the beautiful
[2:05:52] journey of the whole story. But you are
[2:05:55] now the end of the story.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; You are the fulfillment of the very
[2:05:59] thoughts in God's mind that he wanted to
[2:06:02] see. And it's you. I could make real,
[2:06:05] you know, flattering words and poetry to
[2:06:07] tell you how great you are and how
[2:06:10] wonderful it is that God chose you and
[2:06:12] talk about where you came from and the
[2:06:13] sheep coat and the and the poor humble
[2:06:15] families you came from and the nothings
[2:06:18] you once were and how you have been. I
[2:06:20] COULD DO THAT. I COULD really inspire
[2:06:22] you with with telling you things of how
[2:06:25] wonderful it is and how good his grace
[2:06:27] is and and we could HAVE A HALLELUJAH
[2:06:29] SHOUTING JUBILEE ABOUT THE blood of
[2:06:31] Christ and the salvation and the Holy
[2:06:34] Ghost he's given YOU AND THE GIFTS HE'S
[2:06:35] GIVEN YOU TO PREACH AND to speak AND ALL
[2:06:37] OF THAT. I COULD I COULD FILL YOUR
[2:06:39] SPIRITS RIGHT NOW with such inspiration.
[2:06:42] But
[2:06:44] you have a purpose to fulfill. You have
[2:06:47] to fight this enemy of this day. You are
[2:06:51] the ones chosen to overcome it. You have
[2:06:53] to show the manifested word in this
[2:06:56] time. You have to show the word made
[2:06:58] flesh. You have to face the enemy on
[2:07:01] every realm. And there's no hiding from
[2:07:04] it. Church is not a place to hide from
[2:07:07] it. When things go bad, do not stand
[2:07:10] back and blame the church. Do not stand
[2:07:13] black back and blame the ministry.
[2:07:16] If if you are a person not even reading
[2:07:19] the word in a single year, how can you
[2:07:22] blame the church or the ministry?
[2:07:24] They're doing their job.
[2:07:27] Right? WHEN YOU GET SICK AND YOU DON'T
[2:07:29] FEEL LIKE THERE'S HEALING,
[2:07:32] you have to fight it. You have to deal
[2:07:35] with it. YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FACT
[2:07:37] THAT GOD MIGHT CALL YOU HOME THROUGH IT.
[2:07:40] YOU HAVE TO STILL SHOW FAITH right
[2:07:43] through to the end.
[2:07:45] You have to face up to it, saints. This
[2:07:48] is the mystery of God [snorts] made
[2:07:50] flesh, manifested in our day. And we are
[2:07:54] the end of the story.
[2:07:57] Amen.
[2:07:59] And
[2:08:02] if the Bible was still being written
[2:08:03] today, it would be your lives being
[2:08:06] written. It would be your story being
[2:08:08] written. Amen.
[2:08:11] Unfortunately,
[2:08:13] you know, I feel like maybe you guys
[2:08:16] should write
[2:08:18] write some books. The Epis of Mark,
[2:08:24] blessed be the saints from Durban and
[2:08:27] greetings to the saints and so and so
[2:08:28] on.
[2:08:30] Blessings and grace and this and that. N
[2:08:33] be to you. I tell you these things that
[2:08:35] God has done in my life.
[2:08:39] These things I say to you by the Holy
[2:08:41] Ghost. Oh yes. Wax as poetic as you can.
[2:08:47] Write. Tell your story. Testify. Be a
[2:08:51] witness. I don't I'm just being
[2:08:55] dramatic. But uh I I I love it. I love
[2:08:59] poetry. I love the word of God. I love
[2:09:00] the Bible. I love the message. I've come
[2:09:02] to a stage in my life where I cannot
[2:09:04] even read anything else. I cannot even
[2:09:07] concentrate on something I'm reading
[2:09:09] anymore because it just bores me.
[2:09:12] I feel dead if I read something. If it's
[2:09:16] not even something to do with the word,
[2:09:18] it's just it's just like dying itself.
[2:09:20] My brain dies instantly. I go, [gasps]
[2:09:25] I can't cope anymore. I just got to see
[2:09:28] the truth of God for this day. I can't
[2:09:30] look at a newspaper and look at the
[2:09:32] headlines and put it away.
[2:09:34] Newspapers are collecting in my house
[2:09:36] for when we need to clean up something.
[2:09:40] It's terrible, right? We are thirsting
[2:09:43] for the truth and let's find that truth.
[2:09:47] The Lord bless you. Let's bow our heads
[2:09:48] together.
