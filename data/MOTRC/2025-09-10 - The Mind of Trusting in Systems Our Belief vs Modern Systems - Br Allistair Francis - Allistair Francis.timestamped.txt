[1:46] begin our scripture reading from John
[1:49] chapter 5 and verse 46 to 47.
[1:54] John 5 verse 46 to 47
[2:00] and the word of the Lord says for had
[2:03] you believed Moses you would have
[2:05] believed me
[2:07] for he wrote Of Me
[2:09] but if you believe not his writings how
[2:12] shall you believe my words amen the Lord
[2:16] had a blessing to his word let's bow
[2:18] heads together
[2:20] oh dear heavenly father we are thankful
[2:22] to be gathered here in your presence
[2:24] this morning
[2:25] we know that wherever the word is that
[2:28] is where your presence is and that is
[2:30] where the egos are gathered together
[2:33] and therefore we have all come together
[2:35] to make the presence of the Lord
[2:37] manifested in this time we are thankful
[2:40] Lord for your glorious word that you

[2:55] a Salvation to us that is more than
[2:59] anything else in this world a word that
[3:02] is able to transform a world a word that
[3:05] is able to change lives that were lost
[3:08] lives that others felt were meaningless
[3:11] and worthless but you picked us up by
[3:14] that word and transformed Our Lives till
[3:16] even those on the outside can witness
[3:19] and testify that these are changed
[3:22] beings these are changed people these
[3:25] are people who are of value to society
[3:27] and Lord we are so thankful that you
[3:29] have made meaningful lives out of our
[3:32] Lives oh God Mercy thankful Lord for
[3:34] once again and give you praise for this
[3:36] time of Fellowship that we could have
[3:38] together today and we ask you Lord for a

[3:42] morning we like to remember those who
[3:44] are sick and Afflicted brother Stephen's
[3:47] little baby Leyland who is in hospital

[4:45] bless you may be seated
[4:47] so bear with me it's going to sound like
[4:50] I'm going to be
[4:51] shouting a little bit and trying to
[4:53] extend my voice but I trust that you
[4:54] understand so uh once again greetings in
[4:58] the precious name of our Lord and Savior
[4:59] Jesus Christ good to be with all of you
[5:02] once again sharing the word of God this
[5:04] morning it is the 16th of October 2022
[5:09] and we're we're thankful that God has
[5:12] sent us this glorious message in this
[5:15] time that gives
[5:16] so much more meaning to life so much
[5:19] more understanding wisdom beyond what we
[5:21] could have ever imagined and I truly
[5:25] believe has transformed it has
[5:27] transformed the lives of so many people
[5:28] uh and and like we've been speaking in
[5:31] the last few years uh how our minds have
[5:34] been taken away from the mind of the
[5:36] world uh taken away from the thinking we
[5:39] once had and brought into a new life a
[5:42] new thinking a new understanding better
[5:44] wisdom for almost every single sphere of
[5:47] life so that is what we want to speak on
[5:49] this morning so I kind of feel like I
[5:51] want to conclude the series on the
[5:54] benefits of the message and this is
[5:56] benefits of the message 2022 part 77
[6:00] and we're overcoming the mind of today's
[6:04] world part 12. and so for today we're
[6:08] going to be looking at the mind of
[6:10] trusting in systems so those of you who
[6:13] remember in the series this little mini
[6:15] series within the big series we were
[6:17] speaking of the mind of the world and we
[6:19] looked at the mind of different things
[6:21] and when we speak of the mind of
[6:24] different things whether it be the mind
[6:27] of Politics the mind of abortion the
[6:29] mind of transgenderism homosexuality the
[6:32] mind of racism all these kind of things
[6:34] and look at why man is so affected by
[6:38] the mind of those things and you see
[6:41] that those things whatever they are they
[6:43] are things created by man to control
[6:47] other people
[6:48] and there is a mind behind it and the
[6:52] mind is always transferred the mind that
[6:54] comes from these philosophies from these
[6:56] understandings is always transferred to
[6:59] you by teaching by manifestation of
[7:03] things people do by governments by
[7:05] politics by leaders by church leaders by
[7:08] religions that mind of all those things
[7:11] seems to be sort of infecting everything
[7:14] around us
[7:16] so they learn to put those things into
[7:18] your school syllabus into universities
[7:21] into the workplace almost every single
[7:24] mind of the world is infecting every
[7:27] realm of your life
[7:29] and you were called in this day to
[7:31] overcome that mind
[7:33] amen and that is why we are speaking
[7:35] this particular subject or have been for
[7:38] the last 12 services on that so today
[7:41] we're going to look at the mind of
[7:44] trusting in systems amen and I hope it's
[7:47] a it's a good exercise for us today to
[7:50] understand this and for a title our
[7:53] belief our belief versus modern systems
[7:59] amen I think the prophet would have
[8:01] enjoyed this particular subject because
[8:03] when you when you read the message you
[8:05] see how often he picks up on those
[8:07] thoughts on the mind of the world and
[8:10] how everyone behaves and he even said
[8:12] it's been the greatest thing of his life
[8:15] to just watch the behavior of people and
[8:17] the nature that is within people amen
[8:20] so I want to
[8:23] um
[8:24] as an introduction to this and I hope
[8:26] not to be too long this morning because
[8:27] it isn't a very lengthy uh subject
[8:31] I want to elaborate on the three
[8:33] philosophies
[8:35] Society depends on
[8:37] to maintain our morality three
[8:42] philosophies so and there are things
[8:44] that you don't even consider you
[8:48] actually used it this morning on the way
[8:50] to church
[8:51] three philosophies that have been
[8:53] trained into man when you go through
[8:56] school when you when you learn to drive
[8:59] when you become an adult you become so
[9:02] accustomed to these philosophies you
[9:04] don't even realize you are trusting in
[9:07] modern day systems
[9:09] right so most people on Earth desire
[9:13] that all men and women be moral
[9:16] is that right you get out there to
[9:18] people in the street you ask them a
[9:20] question you talk to them and you find
[9:22] they genuinely want to be good
[9:25] except for the criminals but they
[9:28] genuinely want to be good people want to
[9:30] say good morning to you they want to do
[9:32] a nice thing for you when you meet them
[9:34] at the supermarket or the shopping mall
[9:35] or in a parking lot people genuinely
[9:38] want to do things good and they want you
[9:41] to do something good back to them
[9:43] so most people in the world doesn't
[9:46] matter what race you are what religion
[9:48] you come from what culture you have
[9:50] they want to be moral
[9:53] they want you to be moral back to them
[9:55] right and everyone understands what it
[10:00] means to be good and decent
[10:02] from the time you were a child you start
[10:04] to learn what is good and decent and you
[10:07] can see with the child when he grabs
[10:08] something from someone else and he looks
[10:10] at the face of the other child and he
[10:11] sees the child then he tries to give it
[10:14] back and then the other child grabs it
[10:15] then he and they start to learn what is
[10:18] good and what is not good from from
[10:21] their feelings and you don't need a
[10:23] University degree to learn what is good
[10:25] and decent somehow or the other as
[10:27] children grow they can read people's
[10:29] faces and they can understand from who
[10:31] is hurt who is happy and they can sense
[10:34] because there's something inside that
[10:36] knows what is good and decent and that
[10:39] comes from God
[10:40] modern society our world has developed a
[10:44] way of governing people
[10:46] governing the world to maintain a sense
[10:50] of morality that means we have we've had
[10:54] the government come in with laws
[10:55] legislature policies to make sure we
[10:58] don't become criminals
[11:00] do you realize that you could have on
[11:04] the way here stopped by anywhere and
[11:05] stolen something from someone
[11:07] right you could just walk into a shop
[11:10] steal something and come on why don't
[11:11] you do it
[11:14] you say well well it's not the right
[11:16] thing to do but there are people who
[11:18] actually do it
[11:19] but the government has laws in place
[11:22] because you also know if you just do
[11:24] that you can get arrested and thrown in
[11:27] jail so there's also another reason not
[11:29] necessarily because we are good people
[11:31] but we have fear of going to prison
[11:34] so we'll maintain good behavior because
[11:37] there are systems in place to warn us
[11:40] that if we have bad behavior we'll come
[11:42] under severe correction
[11:44] and we are trusting those systems that's
[11:47] why when you see somebody you're driving
[11:49] in your car and you see someone on the
[11:50] road do something that is against the
[11:52] law immediately your face goes up in
[11:54] anger and you look at them and what kind
[11:56] of person is that
[11:58] you'd break the law because there's a
[12:00] law in place and because you know the
[12:02] law and that person knows the law and
[12:04] you know that person knows the law when
[12:06] they do something wrong it affects you
[12:07] emotionally
[12:09] and your face shows it your hands
[12:12] sometimes show
[12:14] so modern societies develop these
[12:17] systems there are many parts to these
[12:19] systems but everything comes under three
[12:23] main philosophies now I apologize for
[12:26] the word philosophies if it sounds too
[12:27] great but philosophy is basically ideas
[12:31] and thinkings of man that are formulated
[12:34] put together to teach something to teach
[12:37] ways of life if I could simplify the
[12:40] meaning of philosophy you have a
[12:42] philosophy you have a philosophy even if
[12:44] you don't call it that you can call it
[12:46] your way your manner something like that
[12:49] but you have a philosophy of how you run
[12:52] your home
[12:53] your wife knows it even your dogs know
[12:56] it
[12:57] see you don't have to teach philosophy
[12:59] through English
[13:00] it happens and it is learned by behavior
[13:03] and people can sense what kind of
[13:05] philosophy you have at home so using
[13:07] that word is not something that you have
[13:10] to learn at University
[13:11] these three main philosophies or systems
[13:15] that we use in this world are used to
[13:18] rule and govern people and we all fall
[13:22] under it we all use it
[13:24] and I want to highlight that to you
[13:26] today all of us come
[13:30] how much
[13:35] much there are so many examples I can
[13:37] give you to illustrate this point but my
[13:39] favorite one which I have used before uh
[13:42] several times is is one that can appeal
[13:45] to everyone and that is
[13:47] driving a car
[13:49] all right for those of you who are
[13:50] drivers and those of you who are
[13:52] dreaming of driving
[13:54] right there are three philosophies you
[13:58] depend on
[14:00] to save your life every day
[14:05] if you or any normal message person
[14:09] think of driving a car on a busy City
[14:12] Road let's say this N3 which is a this
[14:16] N3 freeway or even a road where there's
[14:19] two two-way traffic let's take a road
[14:21] where there's two-way traffic it doesn't
[14:23] matter you're a Believer you're a
[14:24] message believer and you think you're
[14:26] driving a car on a busy City Road in
[14:29] midday traffic
[14:30] you realize you could be killed at any
[14:34] point on that road
[14:36] at any time of the day
[14:38] is that right
[14:40] how many of you today get in to your car
[14:43] thinking I could be killed today you
[14:46] don't
[14:47] you've forgotten about that
[14:49] listen there are cars coming at you in
[14:51] the opposite direction at a hundred
[14:53] kilometers an hour do you know what
[14:55] happens if you're standing there and a
[14:56] car hits you at 100 kilometers an hour
[14:58] you will not survive
[15:00] and if two cars come together at 100
[15:02] kilometers an hour you're not wearing
[15:05] your seatbelt you will not survive you
[15:08] will fly out of your seat smash your
[15:09] head into the windscreen and that's the
[15:11] end of you
[15:12] and you realize that you are in that
[15:15] Peril every day if you're driving a car
[15:19] or you are in a taxi
[15:23] we have created a system of driving that
[15:25] could kill us every day
[15:28] and yet we do it
[15:30] so why are you doing it because you feel
[15:33] there are systems in place that can
[15:34] prevent you from dying
[15:38] and those systems are in place and we
[15:41] trust those systems with our lives
[15:43] without children's lives every single
[15:46] day
[15:47] and you get into the car knowing you
[15:50] could die
[15:51] and you still do it
[15:53] what kind of foolish organism does
[15:55] something like that
[15:57] everywhere in the world organisms
[16:00] creatures will not do things that
[16:02] endanger their lives yet you and I do it
[16:05] every single day that car kills more
[16:08] people in South Africa than anything
[16:10] else
[16:11] I mean over the December period we have
[16:13] to keep counting every year between
[16:16] seven and seven hundred and a thousand
[16:18] deaths just over the Christmas and and
[16:21] festive season is that right
[16:23] not counting the amount of accidents so
[16:26] if you if you count since the time cars
[16:29] were developed how many deaths there are
[16:32] every single year somehow we are still
[16:34] not afraid of it
[16:36] why are we not afraid of it
[16:39] why are our minds tricked into believing
[16:43] that we will survive every single day
[16:46] because we place our faith in those
[16:48] systems
[16:51] without realizing it you have a sort of
[16:53] belief
[16:54] or faith that you won't be killed based
[16:58] on three basic systems three basic
[17:02] philosophies three basic things number
[17:04] one is the individual conscience of the
[17:08] other person
[17:10] so when you're sitting in your car
[17:11] there's another man driving towards you
[17:13] you're thinking
[17:15] well he won't knock me because he also
[17:17] doesn't want to die and we're depending
[17:19] on that
[17:21] that's the first one individual
[17:22] conscience you are depending on the
[17:25] individual conscience of every other
[17:27] driver on the road so they are thinking
[17:30] they want to stay alive so therefore you
[17:31] will be alive you're safer as long as
[17:33] everyone has that individual conscience
[17:36] that's the first one the second system
[17:38] is politics and the law
[17:40] right and we'll explain that just now as
[17:42] long as there are laws in place you are
[17:44] expecting the other drivers to abide by
[17:46] the laws therefore we can feel safe and
[17:48] therefore we won't die when we get into
[17:50] our cars
[17:51] and the third one is religion you are
[17:54] expecting the other people to believe in
[17:57] God of some kind and that they can
[18:00] treasure life and value life so they
[18:03] won't do anything erratic and irregular
[18:05] to kill you
[18:06] so you're depending on individual
[18:08] conscience politics and law and someone
[18:11] else's belief in God so that we can live
[18:14] every day when we get into our car are
[18:16] we only talking about driving
[18:20] we're not even talking about many other
[18:22] things that we place our life in every
[18:25] single day
[18:26] so these are three parts of society that
[18:29] we depend on in all things for us to
[18:32] live peacefully among one another
[18:35] we believe and place our faith in these
[18:38] three systems to work
[18:40] simultaneously for us and we get upset
[18:44] when those systems fail us
[18:48] right you know when someone's individual
[18:51] conscience gets in your way
[18:53] and you wonder how could you be so
[18:56] immoral how could you be so rude how
[18:58] could you do that it gets to you that
[19:00] someone does not have an individual
[19:02] conscience about a specific thing you
[19:05] get upset you get worked up so badly you
[19:08] can go to the police and charge them for
[19:10] something
[19:11] am I right
[19:13] so we believe and place our faith in
[19:16] these three systems to work together we
[19:18] want them to work together
[19:20] simultaneously means at the same time
[19:23] every single day and we don't want them
[19:26] to fail us we don't want these systems
[19:27] to fail us we want it to work the way it
[19:30] should when someone deliberately goes
[19:33] against these systems it really irks us
[19:38] I don't think there's a single driver
[19:39] who does not get Road Rage or angry with
[19:43] somebody else or not road rage but angry
[19:45] with somebody else when they do
[19:46] something wrong
[19:47] it doesn't matter how nice a mood you
[19:49] are in if someone Skips a red light
[19:51] immediately or brow frowns up
[19:54] what kind of person is that
[19:57] okay but the day comes when you skip a
[19:59] red light in Europe they should know we
[20:01] have an emergency
[20:04] right individual conscience
[20:07] let's get to that first part so
[20:09] individual conscience is often based on
[20:12] science
[20:14] means Discovery and knowledge right so
[20:17] science knowledge and parenting so let
[20:21] me let me just put it to you plainly
[20:23] when you're placing your life in the
[20:25] hands of other individuals you are
[20:28] depending on a thought that they might
[20:32] have had a good upbringing
[20:34] hahaha
[20:36] let's hope that taxi driver had a good
[20:39] upbringing so he'll consider my life
[20:42] as much as his own
[20:44] let's hope that
[20:46] that guy in the red Ferrari
[20:49] has had had has had a good upbringing so
[20:54] that you consider my life as valuable as
[20:56] his own and he won't do anything
[20:58] Reckless to push me off the road or
[20:59] something
[21:00] depending on them right
[21:02] now the individual's conscience has got
[21:04] to do with a person knowing within
[21:07] himself what is morally right
[21:11] you are depending on another person to
[21:14] have an understanding of what is morally
[21:16] right
[21:20] so
[21:21] you really trust all those people you
[21:23] don't know were driving past you on the
[21:25] roads every day
[21:27] you you don't even know they're all
[21:29] strangers you don't know where they come
[21:31] from how they were brought up what their
[21:32] philosophies you don't know whether they
[21:34] believe in God or not but you trust
[21:36] they're not going to knock into you
[21:40] what's the reason humans always want a
[21:42] reason I want evidence I want evidence
[21:44] without evidence I'm not going to
[21:45] believe in him what evidence do you have
[21:47] that that person in front of you is
[21:48] going to do the right thing
[21:50] you have no evidence
[21:52] you're depending upon the system
[21:56] that individual conscience of a person
[21:59] has been influenced
[22:01] by the morality of his parents so the
[22:03] first thing you're going to know is the
[22:04] person who's coming at you at 120
[22:06] kilometers an hour he has had parents
[22:08] who brought him up in a way you have no
[22:10] idea but you're hoping they brought him
[22:12] up with good values
[22:14] right they may have taught him from
[22:15] childhood in the aspects of culture
[22:17] traditions and maybe just plain family
[22:21] Dynamics you know whether they taught
[22:23] him his p's and q's more than likely if
[22:25] they brought him up with manners he will
[22:27] drive responsibly it's true it's
[22:29] Behavior if he was a ill-man and child
[22:33] he's going to be a really reckless
[22:34] driver
[22:36] more than likely that's how human
[22:38] behavior is so if it's family Dynamics
[22:41] and the education the knowledge given to
[22:43] him more than likely if he went ahead
[22:45] and got a schooling uh past School past
[22:48] got a diploma or a degree and got a good
[22:51] standing job more than likely that
[22:54] upbringing is going to make him value
[22:56] his life so he wouldn't do something
[22:58] Reckless
[23:01] those sound like stereotypes but that's
[23:03] human behavior right
[23:05] and that's the reason you feel the
[23:08] system will work for you
[23:10] if you have a casual conversation with
[23:12] people they'll tell you you know life
[23:14] would be easier if more people were
[23:16] educated
[23:19] we feel that way yet all the mass
[23:22] murderers in the world were highly
[23:23] educated
[23:24] like Hitler
[23:27] so but we feel those systems work for us
[23:30] the more we educate the people the more
[23:32] peaceful they become it's a lie
[23:35] it's a fallacy but it's kind of the
[23:37] systems we all expecting to to get
[23:41] some of the most timid and respectful
[23:44] people are the people in rural areas who
[23:47] have never seen any education
[23:50] there's no proof that education makes
[23:52] you a more moral person or a nicer
[23:55] person
[23:56] it's just one of those systems we were
[23:58] forced to believe in
[24:00] but it isn't necessarily true
[24:02] so how the person is brought up the
[24:05] education the knowledge of the knowledge
[24:07] of the outside world you know I've seen
[24:10] that stereotype many times you see
[24:12] someone driving
[24:13] on the road and they're really
[24:15] irritating you and you drive past them
[24:16] with a front and think wherever you
[24:18] grown up on a farm this isn't an ox cart
[24:20] it's a highway
[24:22] you know even they can't hear you you're
[24:23] saying
[24:25] you're saying but you feel good
[24:26] afterwards right
[24:27] but you can feel how that the
[24:30] philosophies that you've adopted have
[24:33] given you these ways of stereotyping
[24:35] people and uh and yet you are using
[24:39] these things and you're expecting them
[24:41] to work for you to save your life every
[24:43] single day if you look at parenting and
[24:45] upbringing this is based on how if the
[24:48] person traveling towards you whether he
[24:50] was uh how he was spoken to as a child
[24:53] whether he was spoken gently to whether
[24:54] he was bullied by his father because if
[24:57] he was bullied more than likely he
[24:59] became an aggressive person an
[25:01] aggressive person more than likely is
[25:02] going to have a heavy Lead Foot on the
[25:04] accelerator and he's going to zip
[25:06] through traffic because he's he's got
[25:07] aggression and he's a bully and so on So
[25:10] You Think of Parental upbringing and you
[25:12] think how he was treated by his elders
[25:14] and his peers and how they taught him to
[25:17] view other races of people how to
[25:19] respect the opposite sex how he was
[25:21] instructed to deal with life's problems
[25:24] the techniques he learned as a child to
[25:26] solve difficult issues either by anger
[25:29] or impulse or by calm and Sensibility
[25:34] you think you you need to feel that that
[25:38] guy was parented correctly
[25:41] so that he doesn't
[25:43] get Reckless and knock into you
[25:46] imagine that you're depending on
[25:48] someone's parents who you don't even
[25:49] know about
[25:52] then there is science
[25:53] a science has
[25:56] regards to
[25:58] that driver coming towards you how he
[26:01] views the universe how you've used the
[26:03] Earth whether he feels responsible to
[26:05] the Earth you know you can see people uh
[26:08] when they're driving on the on the
[26:10] freeways or something and you see them
[26:11] throw out beer cans in the windows and
[26:13] the beer can goes bang bang bang onto
[26:15] the road and you're driving of course
[26:17] the beer can is not going to hurt you it
[26:18] might just scratch your car but it makes
[26:20] you angry
[26:21] he's a little bugger
[26:24] he's a filthy person doesn't respect the
[26:27] earth and the rest how far the rest of
[26:30] the half an hour of your life is is torn
[26:32] apart by this person through a beer can
[26:34] you just spoiled your life for half an
[26:36] hour right
[26:37] because he doesn't care about the
[26:39] environment and you feel so morally High
[26:43] you care about the environment uh but of
[26:46] course you're not going to stop and pick
[26:47] up the beer can and make sure you throw
[26:48] it in the bin you're just angry because
[26:50] that guy's morality was messed up and I
[26:53] have a right to be angry with him right
[26:55] so things like that you're hoping people
[26:58] are educated to care for the Earth and
[27:01] if he cares for the Earth and he cares
[27:02] for the environment he'll drive safely
[27:04] as well you won't want to cause
[27:06] accidents in oil spillage and uh
[27:09] wastefulness and things like that you'll
[27:12] think he he has a good understanding of
[27:13] the universe the Earth whether he has
[27:15] any responsibility towards him science
[27:18] influences his ability to use technology
[27:20] responsibly if you respect science he
[27:23] understands things you know nowadays the
[27:25] more common thing is driving while on
[27:27] the cell phone
[27:29] and uh at first everyone was doing it
[27:31] then we realized how dangerous it was
[27:33] and the laws came out and the warnings
[27:34] came out and then now we all realize
[27:36] don't drive in text and now when we see
[27:39] someone do it our morality goes up and
[27:41] we say
[27:42] horrible irresponsible person texting
[27:46] and driving you should know better right
[27:49] so just looking at these things you
[27:51] realize how much you're banking on
[27:54] but we're only speaking about one thing
[27:56] so far individual conscience
[27:58] of that one philosophy look at how much
[28:02] you're banking on to keep you alive on
[28:05] the way to church here
[28:07] through the roads
[28:10] you realize you could pass through any
[28:12] of these streets and somebody people
[28:14] could just stand out in front and throw
[28:16] rocks at your car and that's the end
[28:20] they have the ability there's plenty of
[28:22] rocks everywhere
[28:23] they have the ability they can do
[28:25] whatever they want to so but you're
[28:27] depending upon Society to be civil to be
[28:30] nice to respect your property to not
[28:33] willingly do something to destroy your
[28:36] car crash your car you're hoping people
[28:38] are brought up right and they have their
[28:41] own individual conscience every day and
[28:43] I guarantee when you get into your car
[28:45] every day you don't even think about it
[28:47] you don't even consider that somebody is
[28:49] out there who doesn't care about you or
[28:51] your car and is willing to smash you to
[28:53] smithereens
[28:56] but it doesn't occur to you because
[28:58] you're trusting in the system
[29:02] then we come to politics and the rule of
[29:04] law now
[29:06] here's this is one of the most important
[29:08] things we depend on politics to set for
[29:11] our country's people to live in in Rel
[29:14] to set laws for for our country's people
[29:16] to live in harmony and peace
[29:18] that's what we want is that right we
[29:21] want people to understand listen don't
[29:23] break into people's houses
[29:25] follow the law of the land follow the
[29:27] law of traffic and we can all live in
[29:29] peace and we'll be happy you'll be happy
[29:30] I'll be happy we'll have a great life
[29:32] just and we're trusting the government
[29:35] just to keep that up you know all we
[29:36] want from the government is to set the
[29:38] law police the law correct the offenders
[29:41] you know and we'll be happy we'll make
[29:43] our life by ourselves just so long as
[29:45] they keep that going for us and we will
[29:47] even pay our taxes regularly as long as
[29:50] they can keep this politics because a
[29:51] system that works
[29:53] we place our trust in it amen
[29:56] we depend on correct traffic laws
[30:00] now how many of you feel 120 kilometers
[30:03] an hour is perfectly safe to drive it
[30:07] all right yeah
[30:09] we feel it
[30:12] but who told us that
[30:13] our government made the law
[30:16] have you ever been hit by a cricket ball
[30:18] that's coming at you at 120 case per
[30:20] hour I have
[30:22] I've been hit at one coming at 140
[30:24] kilometers an hour tell you what it's
[30:26] enough to break a rib bust an eyeball
[30:29] fracture a toe out can you imagine a
[30:32] whole car coming to you at 120 K's an
[30:34] hour
[30:38] it's not safe
[30:40] it's not safe to drive at 120 kilometers
[30:42] an hour in your car it's not safe to
[30:44] drive at 100 it's not safe to drive at
[30:46] 80. it's not safe to be sitting behind a
[30:49] a machine with an engine and wheels that
[30:52] could pop out at any instant
[30:55] how if you get up every morning and make
[30:57] sure your wheel nuts are all tight
[31:01] got loose
[31:03] right no there's so much of trust in the
[31:06] system
[31:07] how have you when you go to tiger Wheel
[31:09] and Tire and after they've done it you
[31:10] go and test it everything yourself
[31:12] no because you trust their system these
[31:15] guys are trained one thing about them
[31:17] they're good they've got the diplomas
[31:18] and they've got the certificates that
[31:20] those wheel nuts are definitely tight in
[31:22] the best way there's no way I'm driving
[31:24] and our Wheels popping out not a chance
[31:28] we trust the system
[31:29] see the rule of law and don't worry if
[31:32] something goes wrong I will sue them
[31:35] because that you'll have to be alive to
[31:38] sue them
[31:41] based upon laws of the land and in his
[31:45] willingness to keep those laws you are
[31:47] hoping he would not crash into you and
[31:49] take your life you're hoping the other
[31:52] person driving towards you is a
[31:54] law-abiding citizen one who has gotten
[31:57] his license and didn't buy it
[31:59] and someone who actually learned to
[32:01] drive k-53
[32:03] and got the lessons and learned the
[32:05] rules of the road and understands all
[32:07] the signs you're hoping he keeps the law
[32:09] to keep you alive he or she or even the
[32:13] 16 year old who stole his father's car
[32:17] on other things we depend on laws to
[32:20] control senseless killing of people rape
[32:23] sexual assault death penalty abortions
[32:26] we allow politics to Define marriages
[32:29] right what marriages are legal what are
[32:32] illegal we depend on our political or
[32:34] how divorces should be handled and
[32:37] setting the rights for women and
[32:38] children and once it's signed in we kind
[32:41] of just fall into line
[32:44] we accept it we go along with it we
[32:47] expect courts to exercise the correct
[32:49] judgment and law enforcement to to
[32:52] protect the helpless and and be a help
[32:55] to guide people to enforce the laws set
[32:58] by the politicians
[33:00] I hope you know how things work right
[33:01] the politicians are the big guys
[33:05] top of the pyramid they set the laws the
[33:08] police is a system of justice and the
[33:10] and the courts that are below them to
[33:12] enforce the laws set by the politicians
[33:14] do you know the police
[33:17] they keep the laws based on what the
[33:19] politicians tell them every time a
[33:21] policy is changed it's got to filter
[33:22] down to the police and the police have
[33:24] to adjust the way they they police the
[33:27] the government they police the people if
[33:30] the police do not govern by the law set
[33:33] by the politicians the police are fired
[33:36] or they're supposed to be
[33:38] right that's how it works and then
[33:40] finally it comes down to you so when you
[33:42] break a law the police have the right to
[33:44] arrest you take you to the judicial
[33:46] system the judges convict you put you in
[33:49] prison and the politicians rest well
[33:51] thinking we did the right thing
[33:53] system works for you right so we expect
[33:56] the course to exercise what happens when
[33:58] a judge lets someone go
[34:01] someone who burgled your house but there
[34:03] wasn't enough evidence what do you feel
[34:06] like there the system failed me
[34:10] the same system that's been working but
[34:12] just when it happens to you and things
[34:14] don't go the way you want to suddenly
[34:16] the system fails you
[34:18] right do you know how many people in
[34:19] this country feel that way right now
[34:22] yeah
[34:25] so in essence by us voting we are
[34:29] putting the choice in a political party
[34:32] on whether and how babies should be
[34:34] aborted how people should be killed in
[34:37] the death penalty we feel it's moral as
[34:40] long as a higher power has decided for
[34:43] us well I'm not really the one who did
[34:46] the lethal injection or the the hanging
[34:48] or the whatever it is I'm not really the
[34:51] one who did it it's the government that
[34:52] did it but it looked like it deserved it
[34:54] because of what he did in such and such
[34:55] and such
[34:56] because the political system has chosen
[34:59] that system We Stand by it we're good
[35:01] with that
[35:02] one of these phones is speaking to me
[35:04] here all right
[35:06] so uh politics is supposed to control
[35:09] race relations the racial tension in
[35:13] society politics is supposed to control
[35:15] that right they're not supposed to stoke
[35:18] fires
[35:19] and make things worse they're supposed
[35:21] to make policies that make us live
[35:23] together in peace
[35:25] it's supposed to control properly and
[35:27] show fairness to all Races and cultures
[35:30] so in the case of your oncoming driver
[35:33] the laws make you drive properly and if
[35:36] he crashes into you and you survive you
[35:39] have the law behind you to find him
[35:41] guilty and pay for your damages right
[35:45] so that's the kind of comforting thought
[35:46] so if he crashes into me I've got my
[35:49] insurance
[35:50] my insurance will pay my car but also if
[35:53] he
[35:54] um I can I can prove that he's the one
[35:56] who's guilty I've got that law what if
[35:58] you didn't have that law
[36:00] what if those laws were not there what
[36:02] if there were no such thing as
[36:03] insurances
[36:06] how safe would you feel
[36:08] buying a car that's half a million
[36:14] see if those systems were not in place
[36:16] you'd suffer losses so bad
[36:19] so you're trusting those systems
[36:22] so the other driver as well you're
[36:24] you're hoping he understands that if he
[36:27] crushes his car he also has to pay he's
[36:30] also going to suffer so if we both have
[36:33] that understanding we'll try our best
[36:34] not to crash
[36:36] now I don't know if you've ever tried to
[36:39] teach someone to drive
[36:42] especially a lady
[36:44] for the first time I I try to teach my
[36:47] sister to drive and she got behind the
[36:50] car and while she's driving
[36:52] and uh she sees a car coming she went
[36:57] it's like I'll put your hands in the
[36:59] steering wheel he's gonna knock me he
[37:02] said no he doesn't want to knock you see
[37:04] there was I teaching the system
[37:06] he doesn't want to knock you he wants to
[37:09] avoid you you try to avoid him if you
[37:11] don't look at him and take your hands
[37:13] off you might crash into him
[37:15] so from the start you have to get into a
[37:17] car and try to think the other person
[37:19] doesn't want to knock me I've got to
[37:21] trust that I will start building my
[37:23] faith in there and drive on the road
[37:25] eventually after a while you see
[37:27] especially with the young fellas they
[37:29] get so relaxed trusting everybody that
[37:31] one hand is on the steering wheel all
[37:33] and he's hanging out the window they're
[37:36] so relaxed I trust you you trust me
[37:38] we're all good
[37:41] see but when we start we're like
[37:46] over correcting taking the band really
[37:49] really slow now we're Pros
[37:52] we know the system we trust everybody
[37:55] see
[37:56] the other driver has to be afraid to
[37:59] crash into you so you're trusting that
[38:01] but you are hoping that every car that
[38:03] passes you each day is a good
[38:06] law-abiding citizen
[38:09] are you 100 guaranteed that everyone is
[38:11] 100 percent
[38:13] law-abiding citizen
[38:15] do you know how many accidents we have
[38:17] in Durban in one day
[38:21] of course the last one
[38:23] nowadays is religion you're hoping the
[38:26] other person
[38:27] fears God
[38:29] and that he wouldn't want to willingly
[38:31] do something to hurt you because he
[38:34] fears God
[38:36] and he believes in God and he knows he
[38:38] doesn't want to hurt his fellow man for
[38:41] Spiritual reasons
[38:44] and you're trusting that this man has
[38:47] respect for the presence of God and you
[38:50] believe that you are the same
[38:52] now religion is by far what many people
[38:55] in South Africa depend on for Morality
[38:57] we're still a country that that is very
[39:01] religious
[39:03] it's moving away very fast because of
[39:05] Hollywood and American sort of influence
[39:09] Western influence but in this country
[39:12] many people are still very religious
[39:14] right and we depend on God for our
[39:18] morality we don't depend on someone
[39:20] else's idea for Morality so but it is
[39:23] being found that there is so much
[39:25] immorality occurring in religious
[39:28] organizations that many people in the
[39:30] world are actually losing faith
[39:33] in God
[39:34] many people the Next Generation the
[39:36] children are coming out saying well we
[39:38] don't believe in God God doesn't exist I
[39:40] know my parents are hypocrites I know my
[39:42] Apostle is a hypocrite I know the church
[39:43] people are hypocrites definitely
[39:45] something's wrong they lied to us for so
[39:47] long and you can see that happening with
[39:49] each generation that passes religion was
[39:52] designed by men to help people submit to
[39:56] a higher power
[39:58] to force people to be moral beyond their
[40:02] own conscience
[40:03] because if you see that there is someone
[40:06] who is higher than you and that person
[40:08] or that God has the greatest morality
[40:12] then you'll respect that you as a a
[40:15] person you'll try to be better than even
[40:18] your own thinking
[40:20] and we're depending on good Christian
[40:23] people
[40:24] good Hindu people good Muslim people
[40:27] good Buddhist people we're we're
[40:29] depending on these people who believe in
[40:31] God to live by the morality their
[40:34] religion teaches them
[40:36] and hopefully that morality Will Keep Us
[40:39] Alive longer that we're hoping for
[40:42] religion is supposed to tell you how God
[40:44] wants you
[40:45] want your married life
[40:46] truality bringing up children how you
[40:49] dress decently in public your use of
[40:52] money society's obligations your prayer
[40:55] your fasting your sacrifice religions
[40:58] are supposed to teach you those things
[41:00] and make you focus your faith on God
[41:04] are supposed to
[41:06] to to place morality into a follower of
[41:09] any religion amen
[41:12] so the idea of religions is bear with me
[41:15] I'm just getting through the first three
[41:16] philosophies then we're going to get
[41:18] into what we have to talk about
[41:21] so the idea of religions is
[41:24] if we scared them enough
[41:26] about hell and death or teach them a
[41:29] philosophy about the transfer of energy
[41:31] or the law of karma
[41:33] make them look forward to being in a
[41:36] beautiful place called heaven or a
[41:38] better life after death we could control
[41:41] their behavior
[41:43] we can make them decent Society it was a
[41:46] good thought thousands of years ago
[41:48] religion was the best thought because
[41:50] they had no politics then and government
[41:51] so religions was the government
[41:54] so if that man hurtling towards you at
[41:58] 120 case per hour
[42:01] if he has respect for God and he fears
[42:04] death
[42:05] then you have more chance of surviving
[42:10] right because he feels he doesn't want
[42:12] to die too so he's going to keep both
[42:15] hands on his steering wheel both eyes
[42:17] fixed on the road watching his rear view
[42:19] mirror being a conscientious human being
[42:22] because he fears death
[42:25] what do you do with someone who doesn't
[42:27] fear death
[42:29] or who doesn't care
[42:31] is that a really bad day
[42:34] life just went completely bad for him
[42:36] and he doesn't care whether he lives or
[42:38] dies
[42:39] you better hope that fellow is not the
[42:40] one hustling towards you with 150
[42:42] kilometers an hour
[42:46] so imagine how many cars we pass on the
[42:50] roads every day and each one involves
[42:53] the same process of faith in our minds
[42:57] in those three systems every day every
[43:00] car you drive past you are hoping those
[43:03] three systems work for you so that you
[43:05] live
[43:07] how many of you count how many cars you
[43:08] passed a day
[43:10] a week a year
[43:13] everyone that has passed you
[43:16] your life has been spared
[43:20] and you don't think about it oh you
[43:23] think well maybe I wouldn't die but even
[43:25] in an accident anyone who's been in an
[43:27] accident and no you can break a leg
[43:29] break an arm even if you break a wrist
[43:32] your life is changed
[43:36] you lose an eye
[43:37] or you have some Hemorrhage in the brain
[43:40] or something your life has changed
[43:42] forever
[43:44] and every time you get into a car you
[43:46] are at that risk and hoping that these
[43:49] systems work for you
[43:52] right how many here's the scarier one
[43:56] how many child molesters are there in
[43:58] society
[44:03] a good exercise not a good exercise a
[44:07] very sad exercise if you have to go into
[44:09] South African schools today and ask a
[44:11] class of
[44:12] 30 children just ask them to write down
[44:16] on a piece of paper
[44:17] write down five things that make you sad
[44:19] I'm telling you we've done this so I'm
[44:21] telling you I know what I'm talking
[44:22] about 50 of those children have been
[44:25] abused
[44:26] fifty percent minimum of every class
[44:31] and today
[44:32] more than likely almost 50 percent of
[44:35] those children come from broken families
[44:37] broken marriages divorced cases of that
[44:42] so I'll ask the question again how many
[44:45] child molesters are there in society
[44:47] could it be the person who greets you at
[44:50] the toe at your closest supermarket
[44:53] or the teacher who teaches your child
[44:56] or the tutor who you send your child to
[44:58] for piano lessons
[45:00] or the driver who takes your car to your
[45:03] child to school
[45:04] do you know
[45:07] yet you are using these systems hoping
[45:09] your child is safe for six hours or
[45:13] eight hours away from you every single
[45:17] day
[45:18] you are hoping these systems work you're
[45:20] hoping that person who's with your child
[45:22] is has an individual conscience
[45:27] respects the law
[45:29] and he's afraid to go to jail and that
[45:31] that person believes in God and will not
[45:34] want to do any harm to your child you
[45:36] were hoping those three systems work for
[45:38] you every single day
[45:42] we let our kids out of our sight in the
[45:44] hands of teachers family members most
[45:47] children abused are abused by family
[45:49] members
[45:50] in this country
[45:52] and around the world and family members
[45:54] are the ones you trust in the ones you
[45:55] say it's impossible they could never
[45:58] have done that
[46:00] they cannot be more than likely if your
[46:02] child comes to you and gives you a story
[46:04] you will say no you are lying stop lying
[46:08] that's why it continues until they come
[46:10] to adulthood and hate you for not
[46:12] believing them
[46:14] but we're expecting those three systems
[46:17] to work for us
[46:19] how many people you pass each day are
[46:22] criminals at heart
[46:24] you'll never know
[46:26] but you walk with nervous Faith hoping
[46:29] they all keep to at least one of those
[46:31] three philosophies so that they won't
[46:33] grab your purse or your Satchel your bag
[46:36] or steal something from you or mug you
[46:39] or beat you in the street you don't know
[46:41] if they're criminals but you're hoping
[46:43] every day you step out of your doorsteps
[46:45] walk on the street walk to the shop walk
[46:47] from one office another every person
[46:49] that's passing you we are hoping they at
[46:52] least respect one of those three
[46:53] philosophies and that you'll be safe
[46:55] outside of your house
[46:58] right
[47:00] did you realize how you depended on
[47:03] these modern systems
[47:07] now that we've got that out the way
[47:10] leaders of each philosophy
[47:13] so leaders of the religious philosophy
[47:16] leaders of the political philosophy
[47:18] leaders of the free thinkers who believe
[47:21] in individual conscience
[47:24] each leader believes his
[47:27] science or his faculty
[47:32] is the right one to govern people right
[47:34] so each leader thinks that their element
[47:38] let's call it their element
[47:40] the free thinkers think that
[47:42] individual conscience is more important
[47:45] than religion and politics the
[47:47] politicians think that politics and law
[47:49] is more important and and can properly
[47:53] rule Society the Christians the churches
[47:55] the religious people think if people
[47:58] just believed in God everything will be
[48:00] fine
[48:03] now if you had to ask people in the
[48:05] country for Solutions on how to solve
[48:08] society's problems leaders of politics
[48:10] will say we believe we need to make
[48:12] better laws
[48:15] better laws will help
[48:17] religious leaders believe getting people
[48:20] closer to God will help get them more
[48:22] into church let's have more church
[48:24] services let's have more prayer meetings
[48:27] more church services and more prayer
[48:29] meetings have not proven to do the right
[48:32] thing for people
[48:33] you've had some of the worst offenders
[48:35] come from the most religious of people
[48:39] many free thinkers
[48:41] means people who are atheists who don't
[48:43] believe in God and whatever believe in
[48:44] man's morality they believe morality
[48:47] begins at home and believe that
[48:48] Humanity's problems will be solved if we
[48:51] educate our children and our parents
[48:53] better
[48:54] scientists believe that people should be
[48:57] more highly educated and then Society
[48:59] will be a better place
[49:01] so all these groups believe the
[49:04] solutions lie with their Specialties and
[49:07] each group wants to increase the way
[49:10] they deal with their specialty and they
[49:13] believe that their specialty uh is the
[49:16] best and all the problems in society
[49:18] lies with the other ones do you
[49:19] understand so churches believe the fault
[49:22] of society fault in society or excuse me
[49:26] the reason Society is so bad is because
[49:28] of the politicians and the free thinkers
[49:30] the free thinkers believe it's all the
[49:33] religious people's faults
[49:35] right and the politicians well they
[49:38] disagree with everybody including their
[49:41] own politicians
[49:42] so
[49:45] if we live in an Ideal World
[49:48] right when it should take a perfecting
[49:50] of all three philosophies if if we
[49:53] looked in an ideal world and what we're
[49:55] hoping for then all three philosophies
[49:58] will have to have their best ideas to
[50:01] make society live at peace
[50:03] okay
[50:05] and you would think well you know there
[50:06] are countries there are countries like
[50:08] let's take Singapore who grew up under
[50:11] Mr Lee Kuan Yew who really took that
[50:13] country cleaned it up they have like if
[50:16] you lit in the streets just throwing a
[50:18] paper on the floor in Singapore you get
[50:19] a thousand dollar fine
[50:21] so you walk to Singapore it's spotless
[50:25] if you vandalize somebody's property you
[50:29] get smacked with a cane they call it the
[50:31] rattan
[50:32] so they believe in corporal punishment
[50:34] heavy fines
[50:36] speed limit the highest speed limit in
[50:38] Singapore is like 80 kilometers an hour
[50:41] and and probably only on like two
[50:43] freeways or something so and the rest of
[50:47] the place everyone is driving really
[50:48] slow then they have this thing called a
[50:50] mass Rapid Transit they call it the MRT
[50:52] train you can
[50:54] you don't even need cars in Singapore
[50:56] you can just and you you think well
[50:58] that's a system we should have in South
[51:00] Africa you know the respect no littering
[51:03] no this no that you know what's the
[51:05] problem Singapore is an island
[51:08] they don't even have a population like
[51:10] we have it's easier to control a small
[51:12] amount of people
[51:14] now spread it across a large massive
[51:17] piece of land with people living
[51:18] everywhere how many years is it going to
[51:20] take you to get a policy to a person in
[51:24] the north of our country who doesn't
[51:26] even understand your language
[51:29] how are you going to do that you can't
[51:31] adopt Singapore's philosophy in a place
[51:33] like South Africa it's not going to work
[51:35] are you with me
[51:37] so if we lived in an Ideal World then it
[51:40] would take perfecting of all these three
[51:42] philosophies to have an ideal Society so
[51:45] we have to ask ourselves these questions
[51:48] are you still with me
[51:50] don't worry about the technology here
[51:53] they're trying to get things going
[51:56] I think one of those UPS's beeps like
[51:58] crazy so just try and uh look away from
[52:01] that so ask ourselves these questions
[52:04] do you believe you are a moral person
[52:09] do you believe you are one of those
[52:11] people
[52:11] that will never do anything to endanger
[52:14] another person that you are driving
[52:17] towards
[52:18] that you are always going to do the
[52:20] right thing every single day and you
[52:22] will never endanger the life of any
[52:24] pedestrian or car or any person or poor
[52:27] mother and child in a car do you believe
[52:30] you are that moral person who do you
[52:32] think
[52:33] uh why do you think you are a moral
[52:36] person
[52:38] is it because of God is it because of
[52:40] the laws of the land is it because
[52:41] you're a nice person is it because you
[52:43] had a nice upbringing a good upbringing
[52:45] what is it why are you a moral person
[52:47] does everyone around you believe you are
[52:51] a good moral person and respect you as
[52:54] one of the highest people in society
[52:57] is your religion the answer for the
[53:00] present world
[53:01] is your religion the answer for the
[53:03] present world
[53:04] is your tradition
[53:06] the answer for the present world
[53:09] is your knowledge and concept of God the
[53:13] right one
[53:14] or the wrong one or the only one
[53:18] has your personal belief and philosophy
[53:21] of Life worked perfectly for you is it
[53:24] working perfectly for you right now
[53:29] is your life exactly
[53:32] how you think it should have been lived
[53:36] do you live with depression or sadness
[53:39] or deep regrets of the past
[53:41] and the last question question number 12
[53:43] do you fear death
[53:47] all right so if you are an honest person
[53:50] you'll see that based on your own
[53:53] answers it is impossible for society to
[53:56] get Humanity to a place of being
[53:59] truly moral
[54:01] because when you answer these questions
[54:02] you realize no matter how good you are
[54:05] as a person whether you're a pastor of a
[54:07] church Deacon or whatever you'll realize
[54:09] how many of these we actually lack in
[54:14] and that when we step into our cause
[54:18] people are depending upon me and I'm not
[54:20] exactly a person everyone can depend on
[54:24] you admit we have flaws
[54:29] well one of those flaws is a lot of
[54:31] people have very bad eyesight and should
[54:32] never be driving a car
[54:36] but they trust their eyesight
[54:39] and you do too apparently
[54:43] it sounds like we're all a bunch of
[54:45] fools doesn't it
[54:48] so even if they answer all the questions
[54:51] in their moral and all of that but they
[54:52] have a bad eyesight
[54:55] or someone whose muscles lock every now
[54:58] and then on his right leg where you
[55:00] press the accelerator
[55:01] you know how many people had that
[55:03] condition
[55:06] but don't worry
[55:08] we're trusting them
[55:10] religions have tried and failed some
[55:13] believe true spirituality and Holiness
[55:16] is acquired by staying away from the
[55:18] world so there are there are
[55:20] denominations in the world who believe
[55:22] rather
[55:23] live in the countryside using Ox cart no
[55:27] accidents
[55:29] right until after 10 years you get an ox
[55:32] who's rebellious
[55:35] and who wants to gore you with his horn
[55:37] the first chance he gets
[55:39] and trample you into the mud
[55:42] those things happen by the way
[55:45] beliefs of abstinence in other words
[55:47] staying away from things staying in the
[55:49] mountains being a priest or a monk not
[55:51] eating vile foods not partaking in
[55:54] sexuality or so they claim having no
[55:56] greed or want of anything Etc does that
[55:59] make them moral
[56:01] because they don't do physical or they
[56:04] don't physically do bad things does not
[56:06] make them moral
[56:08] they can still think it and the first
[56:11] chance they get they're going to do
[56:12] something
[56:14] so not doing something and yet Desiring
[56:17] it is still being immoral inside I think
[56:20] we spoke about that recently in the
[56:22] middle of the road so how is staying
[56:26] away from everything more moral than
[56:29] actually having a wife raising a family
[56:31] and living decently among people
[56:36] hey in a troubled world
[56:39] how is it more moral you find a person
[56:42] you understand what I'm saying you get
[56:44] someone who says stay away from
[56:45] everything don't touch a woman don't
[56:47] touch a man don't have money don't
[56:49] desire anything live poor live in the
[56:51] mountains be a monk you know all of that
[56:53] is that a better person than someone who
[56:55] actually does all that and stays decent
[56:59] who is stronger which is the stronger
[57:01] one the one who stays away from
[57:03] everything
[57:05] or the one who stays amongst everything
[57:07] and remains decent who is it
[57:10] you see human philosophies humans
[57:12] thinking is that guy there must be
[57:15] really holy to do all that he must be
[57:17] holy no you don't have to be holy to do
[57:19] that you can just be brainwashed
[57:22] it's really simple
[57:24] do you know how to how to get soldiers
[57:27] Brother Martin can probably tell us if
[57:29] you anyone was in the army
[57:32] to get a person to shoot another person
[57:35] on command requires brainwashing
[57:39] that your sergeant majors Colonels and
[57:42] Generals have been taught to do
[57:44] the first thing they do is they
[57:46] demoralize you when you get there in the
[57:49] Army they've got you come there thinking
[57:51] well I'm a pastor's son I come from a
[57:53] good Society you know I'm a good person
[57:55] that General is going to make you feel
[57:57] like dirt
[57:58] is going to make you feel equal he's
[58:00] going to call you maggot he's going to
[58:02] call you all kinds of names demoralize
[58:05] you until he flattens all the things
[58:08] that you thought about yourself when you
[58:10] feel equal to all these people then it
[58:11] starts
[58:12] making you charm things brainwashing you
[58:16] and the next thing you know you are
[58:18] going to shoot on command
[58:21] without thinking he's going to get you
[58:23] to believe you're a soldier and don't
[58:26] worry about the life you are taking
[58:27] because
[58:29] you are taking an order and you are
[58:31] doing the right thing for your country
[58:33] that's how a soldier is taught
[58:36] and at the end you're you're a person
[58:38] who's brainwashed into taking another
[58:40] life and believing you've done the right
[58:42] thing how is it ever the right thing
[58:45] it's not
[58:46] right and yet today even with with the
[58:51] religious systems you don't see it's the
[58:53] same thing as long as you are you are
[58:56] Charmed to that you are forced into
[58:58] something you are forced
[59:01] to to keep certain laws you are just
[59:03] brainwashed
[59:05] that's all there's no faith involved
[59:06] it's not Holiness to to be stuck in the
[59:10] mountains stay away from society don't
[59:11] eat this don't eat this don't do this
[59:13] because the first time you take that
[59:14] person and stick him in it he's gonna
[59:16] break every single law he had he's not
[59:19] going to cope because staying away from
[59:21] things does not make you holy
[59:24] are you with me
[59:27] and what is Holy
[59:29] holy means set aside for God's purpose
[59:34] I mean God's purpose is definitely not
[59:37] staying in the mountains doing nothing
[59:40] and chanting God's name every day
[59:42] that's not God's purpose God's purpose
[59:44] was let my light shine
[59:47] to all the world go into the world and
[59:50] give them the gospel
[59:52] not stay in the mountains and behave
[59:54] like there's nobody in the world
[59:57] so there are other religions that parts
[1:00:01] of Christianity that believe you should
[1:00:03] not touch technology like the Mormons I
[1:00:07] want to show them or the Amish people so
[1:00:08] at the moments the Amish people in
[1:00:10] America stay away from society don't
[1:00:12] deal with any technology don't use
[1:00:14] phones just work with wood in your hands
[1:00:16] and they have a very pleasant Society
[1:00:19] but it doesn't make that system moral
[1:00:22] because there's a lot of immorality that
[1:00:24] goes on there
[1:00:26] right so we find that there's absolutely
[1:00:29] no way that Society can ever get this
[1:00:32] right
[1:00:34] now I'm not a preacher of Doom quite to
[1:00:37] the contrary if you take
[1:00:39] so let's go back to that thing of
[1:00:42] the driver who's coming towards you
[1:00:44] remember you were expecting that driver
[1:00:46] to have individual conscience
[1:00:49] to
[1:00:51] respect the law politics
[1:00:53] yes
[1:00:55] and to believe in God three things and
[1:00:57] you're hoping it works for him
[1:00:59] yes
[1:01:02] now
[1:01:04] you just have to add one thing in which
[1:01:07] is alcohol
[1:01:10] he's drunk the moment he's drunk all
[1:01:14] three philosophies fail
[1:01:20] if you just add now we're not even
[1:01:22] talking about drugs and other things
[1:01:24] let's just talk about alcohol
[1:01:25] consumption
[1:01:28] can home education prevent you from
[1:01:30] abusing it
[1:01:33] can religion prevent you from abusing it
[1:01:36] can political laws of this country do it
[1:01:38] absolutely not because the political
[1:01:40] laws of this country actually allow the
[1:01:42] breweries to continue
[1:01:45] mass production of alcohol
[1:01:48] so if you add one thing one thing
[1:01:51] alcohol to a human and he becomes
[1:01:54] addicted to it every other philosophy to
[1:01:57] keep you safe is out the door
[1:02:00] right and you know why there are so many
[1:02:03] accidents over Christmas because there
[1:02:05] are that many more drunk drivers
[1:02:09] are you with me so if you just take
[1:02:11] alcohol consumption here is just one
[1:02:14] thing that Society has absolutely no
[1:02:17] control over
[1:02:19] forget about smoking and the sign that
[1:02:21] says if you're under 18 you're not
[1:02:23] allowed to the signs are all there and
[1:02:25] the shopkeeper still serves it to these
[1:02:27] people
[1:02:28] to the 16 year olds why he wants money
[1:02:31] he wants more money and the poor 16 year
[1:02:34] olds really want to smoke it I want no
[1:02:37] idea why
[1:02:39] they want a full day headspace
[1:02:42] with smoke
[1:02:44] you know it's just one thing right
[1:02:46] society when a person is under the
[1:02:48] influence of alcohol he will disregard
[1:02:50] his own conscience he's not in control
[1:02:52] of his own conscience and his religion
[1:02:55] and crash into you and kill you and not
[1:02:59] know what he's done until you get sober
[1:03:03] and every time you're in your car every
[1:03:06] day you're hoping the person coming
[1:03:09] towards you is not drunk
[1:03:12] you say okay the solution is stop
[1:03:15] drinking altogether
[1:03:17] do you think right now anywhere in the
[1:03:19] world you can ban alcohol
[1:03:23] I mean surely with all the education we
[1:03:26] have we should be able to have people
[1:03:29] thinking we should ban alcohol
[1:03:32] drugs we should right
[1:03:35] but if you banned alcohol today you
[1:03:38] would turn the world upside down and
[1:03:40] undo a 5 000 year old tradition of
[1:03:44] drinking
[1:03:46] religion would have tried to stop the
[1:03:48] act of buying it and consuming it
[1:03:50] politics would have to stop the
[1:03:52] production of it
[1:03:54] science would have to stop finding new
[1:03:56] methods to refine it and make it tastier
[1:04:01] which means a very large portion of
[1:04:04] society would lose their jobs
[1:04:08] do you know how many people in this
[1:04:10] country work
[1:04:12] to make legal alcohol
[1:04:15] Millions
[1:04:16] or thousands Maybe
[1:04:18] in the breweries and how many different
[1:04:20] types of breweries are there
[1:04:23] the first is the wine makers then
[1:04:24] there's the Brandy makers and the
[1:04:26] whiskey makers and the beer makers and
[1:04:28] the ale makers and the spirits makers
[1:04:30] and ah the list goes on and on there are
[1:04:34] so many companies
[1:04:35] it's all humans are so brainwashed you
[1:04:38] cannot have a single party or wedding
[1:04:40] without alcohol you can't have a
[1:04:42] restaurant without alcohol you can't
[1:04:45] have fine dining without alcohol
[1:04:47] nobody knows if you take alcohol away
[1:04:49] from a corporate function or a party
[1:04:51] nobody knows what to do people today
[1:04:54] can't even have a conversation without
[1:04:56] having alcohol
[1:04:58] so humans can't do without alcohol
[1:05:01] anymore in their lives
[1:05:04] do you think any government that comes
[1:05:06] in is ever going to stop alcohol
[1:05:08] production
[1:05:10] not a chance
[1:05:11] which means our lives are in Peril every
[1:05:14] single day because people are drinking
[1:05:17] alcohol
[1:05:19] and whenever that happens
[1:05:21] everything stops
[1:05:24] philosophy one philosophy two philosophy
[1:05:26] three goes out the door it's done it's
[1:05:28] over you are not safe on the road take
[1:05:31] those child molesters we're talking
[1:05:32] about
[1:05:34] if they had a drink
[1:05:37] if they took their drugs
[1:05:40] those people have lost their minds
[1:05:42] already and now you give them a
[1:05:43] substance that makes it
[1:05:45] over and done with or they've been
[1:05:48] giving them medication and their
[1:05:49] medication is getting weaker
[1:05:53] so the solution is not even to stop it
[1:05:56] we can't stop it we literally cannot
[1:05:58] stop something that is killing us
[1:06:02] no no what we cannot we won't
[1:06:06] we won't stop it
[1:06:10] parents
[1:06:11] religion would say stop the act of
[1:06:13] buying it politics will say stop would
[1:06:16] have to stop the production science
[1:06:17] would have to stop making it tastier
[1:06:18] restaurant should never sell it parents
[1:06:21] wedding or parents should never ever
[1:06:24] consume it
[1:06:26] parents should never come home and say
[1:06:28] well let's just have a beer
[1:06:29] no
[1:06:31] right parties weddings get-togethers
[1:06:34] would have to find something else to
[1:06:36] make them Merry what's that going to be
[1:06:38] sweets
[1:06:42] let's go out for some sweets
[1:06:46] at the sports game anybody wants a sweet
[1:06:51] chocolate maybe chocolate is good
[1:06:56] you know what custard danishes
[1:07:01] they're really good you should try them
[1:07:03] sometime
[1:07:04] restaurants should never sell the idea
[1:07:06] of fine dining with change
[1:07:08] how can they have duck all around
[1:07:10] without wine
[1:07:14] hey and they're oysters and all that
[1:07:17] without wine it's just not going to be
[1:07:18] right
[1:07:20] they're not going to have it
[1:07:22] and yet the most common sense thing to
[1:07:25] do to stop alcohol in this in the world
[1:07:28] we cannot do it
[1:07:31] but what do we do we have to we have to
[1:07:34] Perfect all the other systems so we can
[1:07:36] also control alcohol
[1:07:38] you're hoping people would drink
[1:07:40] moderately you're hoping they'd have
[1:07:42] enough and not overdo it you're hoping
[1:07:45] they would not have a depressed life and
[1:07:47] overdo it you're trusting the
[1:07:49] individual's conscience
[1:07:54] and people
[1:07:56] you know if you took away alcohol they
[1:07:58] just find other substances
[1:08:00] you know in Mexico they have this this
[1:08:03] cactus
[1:08:04] I mean it's the yuckiest thing you've
[1:08:07] ever seen the cactus literally has this
[1:08:09] glue that comes out of it like a like a
[1:08:12] paste
[1:08:13] icky doesn't even feel right
[1:08:17] and they're making alcohol out of that
[1:08:20] they fermented to can you imagine
[1:08:22] sucking on a paste
[1:08:24] that's intoxicating
[1:08:27] and yet men will do it
[1:08:30] you can't stop it
[1:08:32] you just stop one substance they'll find
[1:08:34] another one
[1:08:36] people will do it there's no solution
[1:08:39] the world has for this problem in
[1:08:42] hundreds of years
[1:08:43] the best the Bible can tell you is have
[1:08:46] a little wine for thy stomach's sake in
[1:08:48] the days when they had no probiotics
[1:08:50] uh or don't touch it at all the Bible
[1:08:53] can can tell you that a drunken man
[1:08:56] should never be in the presence of the
[1:08:58] Lord the Bible tells us things that's
[1:09:00] all it can do is advise you
[1:09:02] but there's no way the Bible would even
[1:09:05] tell Moses to stop the production of
[1:09:07] alcohol in the in the land of Canaan
[1:09:12] you would never ever find because humans
[1:09:14] are never going to do it
[1:09:19] let's look at our churches okay churches
[1:09:22] run by the same philosophies
[1:09:25] we don't even realize it
[1:09:27] when we come in here we depend on
[1:09:29] people's individual responsibility
[1:09:32] keep your children quiet don't chew gum
[1:09:34] keep the Cod dress decently sit in order
[1:09:39] rise when the person tells you to write
[1:09:41] sit down when they tell you to sit
[1:09:43] individual conscience
[1:09:45] be gentle be kind be forgiving speak
[1:09:48] nicely are you with me we depend on
[1:09:51] people's individual responsibility
[1:09:53] conscience to support the church to help
[1:09:56] guide others
[1:09:57] to be kind and gentle to be forgiving
[1:09:59] and live as examples to others here and
[1:10:03] outside in their lives so if you are
[1:10:05] seen in public people see you are
[1:10:07] dressed decently you are behaving
[1:10:09] correctly you're a member of that church
[1:10:11] you're an outstanding member we're
[1:10:13] expecting everyone's individual
[1:10:15] conscience to work same system
[1:10:19] usually churches teach Doctrine religion
[1:10:22] that is in keeping with our laws that we
[1:10:24] set for a sovereign Church it would make
[1:10:26] more sense if laws were made based on
[1:10:30] Doctrine we would think right laws of
[1:10:32] the country
[1:10:33] but again over time these three
[1:10:35] philosophies fail
[1:10:37] and it leads the church into disarray
[1:10:41] right we set laws over our congregations
[1:10:44] with threats of not making it in the
[1:10:46] Rapture or not making it to heaven and
[1:10:49] promising the hope of a better life on
[1:10:50] Earth and if you follow the laws you'll
[1:10:52] have a better life you will follow the
[1:10:54] laws you'll make it to Heaven those are
[1:10:55] the laws we're teaching them it's kind
[1:10:57] of like the politics
[1:10:59] right
[1:11:01] and the churches must teach Doctrine we
[1:11:03] why do we go to this church because we
[1:11:05] like this Doctrine better than the other
[1:11:06] one
[1:11:08] see
[1:11:09] it would make more sense if the laws
[1:11:11] were based on Doctrine but again over
[1:11:14] time like we said the philosophies fail
[1:11:17] the church goes into disarray Doctrine
[1:11:19] can never be kept for more than a few
[1:11:21] years
[1:11:23] you know why because new understanding
[1:11:26] always suffices and doctrines have to be
[1:11:28] adjusted
[1:11:30] so you have the people Society changes
[1:11:32] and old laws are never strong enough to
[1:11:35] govern new generations
[1:11:37] continuously and have to be discussed to
[1:11:40] change now by the time you can get a
[1:11:43] church to have a meeting to discuss
[1:11:45] whether a Doctrine should be adjusted
[1:11:47] because societies change children have
[1:11:50] changed the next generation is coming
[1:11:52] can be adjusted to who's going to adjust
[1:11:54] it who has the right to adjust it
[1:11:56] that's when you end up for 50 years and
[1:11:59] finally you have these old men with gray
[1:12:01] beards standing there no no no no
[1:12:03] we've got to still keep what sent
[1:12:06] so-and-so said
[1:12:11] it never works because two sides will
[1:12:14] prevail those who insist on keeping old
[1:12:17] laws just uh as they were 50 years ago
[1:12:20] and those who insist on changing laws
[1:12:23] who is right
[1:12:25] I mean that's what happened in the
[1:12:26] message 50 years later after the prophet
[1:12:28] is gone who has the right who are you
[1:12:30] that's the first question message
[1:12:31] Believers will ask you who are you
[1:12:33] brother Alistar to change the laws
[1:12:39] are you saying it the way the prophet
[1:12:40] said it do you know how many people you
[1:12:42] can have the most corrupt person in the
[1:12:44] church tell you you are wrong on COD
[1:12:48] and tell you you have no right you're
[1:12:49] not saying what the prophet said
[1:12:51] therefore you cannot change the laws
[1:12:54] first question I ask them is where did
[1:12:56] Brother Bear make a law
[1:13:00] he didn't even do what
[1:13:04] it's the preachers that came after him
[1:13:06] that decided to enforce things that they
[1:13:08] thought
[1:13:09] were laws on anything
[1:13:14] show me one place where the Prophet
[1:13:15] tells you how to police a law
[1:13:19] how much time do you give a person to
[1:13:21] excommunicate them for a specific
[1:13:23] offense
[1:13:24] whose discretion is it
[1:13:27] where is that in COD it's not there
[1:13:31] which means it's been adjusted by Church
[1:13:34] governing bodies
[1:13:36] by Church boards by a deacon board by
[1:13:39] the pastors it's been and over time the
[1:13:42] the problem that people have had is why
[1:13:45] does that church do it that way and our
[1:13:46] church does it this way why does that
[1:13:48] church handle this why does that church
[1:13:49] not excommunicated we excommunicate
[1:13:51] everybody
[1:13:55] see who is right
[1:13:58] parenting always gets more relaxed over
[1:14:01] time in churches because we get relaxed
[1:14:05] parenting gets relaxed and therefore we
[1:14:07] see eventually an absolute upheaval of
[1:14:12] an entire original belief or faith
[1:14:16] what am I saying to you after 50 years
[1:14:18] you suddenly get a message charged with
[1:14:21] children who don't want to believe the
[1:14:22] message
[1:14:23] how did that happen
[1:14:28] let's take our homes
[1:14:30] how many of you know that you handle
[1:14:32] your homes with the same three
[1:14:34] philosophies
[1:14:35] in a home you unknowingly follow the
[1:14:37] same philosophies individual conscience
[1:14:39] laws religion
[1:14:43] just maybe in your house you enforce one
[1:14:45] stronger than the other one
[1:14:48] so if I have to ask your children
[1:14:49] they'll be more honest than you
[1:14:52] who sets the laws in your house they'll
[1:14:55] tell you whether it's mommy or daddy
[1:14:57] they know who enforces it they'll tell
[1:15:00] you whether it's mommy or daddy right
[1:15:03] who sets the laws in your house who sets
[1:15:06] the Family's religion
[1:15:08] you do right you set down the laws you
[1:15:10] set down a Family's religion husbands
[1:15:12] and wives kind of speak together and see
[1:15:13] which laws work for them and they make
[1:15:15] it known to the children how do you
[1:15:18] police those laws
[1:15:19] right how do you deal with an offense
[1:15:22] when your child breaks a law what do you
[1:15:25] do when you break the law
[1:15:29] you expect everyone in the family to
[1:15:31] understand that the way you set things
[1:15:33] out was not selfish and it was for the
[1:15:36] good of the entire family
[1:15:38] does it work you know one of the best
[1:15:40] things to do with parents is your child
[1:15:42] asks you but why are you allowed to do
[1:15:44] that well because I'm an adult
[1:15:47] and that's supposed to work
[1:15:50] it doesn't work
[1:15:55] absolutely not just ask your teenagers
[1:15:59] teenagers are the first one to tell you
[1:16:00] no
[1:16:02] if it's not good for me it's also not
[1:16:03] good for you
[1:16:05] have you heard this one I'm I'm almost
[1:16:08] an adult
[1:16:10] I like those ones because then I could
[1:16:12] say well you can almost do it there
[1:16:17] it's a lot of fun parenting is a lot of
[1:16:19] fun
[1:16:21] and children don't worry you'll become
[1:16:22] parents one day and go through the same
[1:16:24] mess we go through
[1:16:27] so unbelief
[1:16:33] I remember what we're talking about is
[1:16:34] our belief versus modern systems right
[1:16:40] overcoming the mind of today's world and
[1:16:42] what we're understanding is that we've
[1:16:45] actually been
[1:16:46] sort of sucked into
[1:16:49] believing in these World Systems and
[1:16:52] making them work for us and we don't
[1:16:54] realize how much they stress us out
[1:16:55] because they don't really work
[1:16:58] and every now and then we know of
[1:17:01] someone who has lost their lives their
[1:17:03] life because the system failed
[1:17:08] so what is the problem and is there a
[1:17:10] solution
[1:17:10] there is this this common condition in
[1:17:13] man you might have heard about it it's
[1:17:15] called unbelief
[1:17:18] it is an ancient evil nature and I want
[1:17:21] you to listen carefully that began by
[1:17:24] man denying his maker
[1:17:27] that's where it started
[1:17:29] and denying truth
[1:17:33] unbelief
[1:17:34] now this is what the Bible identifies
[1:17:37] sin as unbelief
[1:17:40] amen true immorality
[1:17:44] is not the stuff that people do that is
[1:17:47] wrong true immorality is denying the
[1:17:51] original
[1:17:52] god-given human ability to believe and
[1:17:56] have faith
[1:17:59] the reason parenting doesn't work for
[1:18:02] you is that your children secretly don't
[1:18:05] believe you
[1:18:10] or the laws you lay down
[1:18:12] there's something about humans
[1:18:15] they work by belief they just don't
[1:18:18] always know it
[1:18:20] right they if your children don't
[1:18:23] believe you
[1:18:25] they won't follow your laws
[1:18:27] it's not about God it's not about any
[1:18:29] children are watching you they need to
[1:18:32] believe you
[1:18:34] everything in your house works on belief
[1:18:39] they don't if they don't see truth in it
[1:18:42] because the way you presented to them is
[1:18:45] untruthful
[1:18:46] they're not going to believe it and they
[1:18:49] will not see any value in following it
[1:18:54] the reason Society doesn't wholly follow
[1:18:57] the laws of the political party
[1:19:00] that the politic political government
[1:19:02] sets out is because at heart the country
[1:19:05] the society doesn't believe in the law
[1:19:11] they don't they only agree to it for the
[1:19:14] sake do you understand that
[1:19:16] half of the laws in this country you
[1:19:18] don't believe in
[1:19:19] you just agree for the sake of peace to
[1:19:22] do it and it frustrates you
[1:19:24] right and if you are to sit down with
[1:19:27] your friends I don't know how many times
[1:19:29] I've sat down with people and just
[1:19:30] listened to them all govern the country
[1:19:33] you can be at some event you can meet
[1:19:37] with parents at a at a school function
[1:19:40] or you know or a child's party and
[1:19:42] there's all the dads there talking and I
[1:19:44] love those times because I just like to
[1:19:46] sit and observe but I I listen to them
[1:19:48] all and everyone knows how to govern the
[1:19:50] country there
[1:19:52] everyone knows the political party is
[1:19:54] wrong and this one is wrong that one is
[1:19:56] wrong
[1:19:56] everybody knows
[1:19:58] every man believes he can
[1:20:03] he can what does that tell me I'm
[1:20:04] sitting there thinking not one of you
[1:20:05] actually believes in the laws
[1:20:08] you just follow it because you don't
[1:20:09] want to be arrested
[1:20:11] and so far it works for you to a certain
[1:20:13] degree
[1:20:14] so you don't really believe in it but
[1:20:17] you follow it
[1:20:20] and that's what a lot of church people
[1:20:22] do
[1:20:25] so they only agree for the sake of peace
[1:20:28] and for a season but as soon as they see
[1:20:31] it doesn't work for them they ditch it
[1:20:33] instantly or when you are pushed into a
[1:20:36] corner have you seen a person pushed
[1:20:37] into a corner A desperate person he's
[1:20:39] going to break every single law because
[1:20:41] in that moment he feels he's Justified
[1:20:44] because he's desperate
[1:20:46] and a desperate person will do anything
[1:20:48] to spare his life in that moment be it
[1:20:51] breaking a law or denying God
[1:20:56] Peter
[1:20:59] see so when you pushed in the corner
[1:21:02] when there's a drastic needle you're
[1:21:03] forced to make a critical decision you
[1:21:05] will do what you feel is good for you
[1:21:07] even if the law prohibits it
[1:21:10] am I right your child is choking on
[1:21:12] something you're going to break every
[1:21:14] law getting them to the hospital
[1:21:18] and maybe you you put on your hazard
[1:21:20] lights for your car thinking well people
[1:21:23] should understand this is an emergency
[1:21:24] and I'm driving at the highest speed I'm
[1:21:27] I'm going through every red light and
[1:21:30] we're just trusting we're going to get
[1:21:32] there safe your child is choking on
[1:21:34] something
[1:21:36] I mean you don't think driving it so
[1:21:38] recklessly you might kill all of you
[1:21:39] including your child
[1:21:43] what do you do it's because you feel in
[1:21:46] the moment
[1:21:47] you are Justified to break every single
[1:21:50] law
[1:21:52] in that moment you have lost all belief
[1:21:55] in the system
[1:21:57] the reason your church people eventually
[1:21:59] don't believe in your religious laws is
[1:22:02] because it's too far-fetched and these
[1:22:04] are the words of Christ it's too
[1:22:05] far-fetched in your presentation of it I
[1:22:08] mean if you still continue preaching
[1:22:10] heaven like how your ancestors did your
[1:22:14] children are eventually going to look at
[1:22:16] you like
[1:22:17] I got to be careful what I say right
[1:22:19] here
[1:22:21] um
[1:22:22] well
[1:22:24] um your children are going to look at
[1:22:25] you like you believe in fairy tales
[1:22:28] I was about to speak or criticize
[1:22:30] certain men of Christmas and Easter
[1:22:34] bunny
[1:22:36] the tooth Mouse
[1:22:38] anyway you become parents like that you
[1:22:40] become people like that
[1:22:42] who you paint this picture of this God
[1:22:45] in heaven with these angels and all of
[1:22:47] these things that you you're preaching
[1:22:49] this fantasy eventually your children
[1:22:51] can look at you and think wow you're
[1:22:53] crazy
[1:22:55] they're not going to believe you
[1:22:56] anything they're not going to believe
[1:22:57] anything you say
[1:22:59] why because the teachers at school are
[1:23:01] making a lot more sense than you
[1:23:03] you can't come to your child and say
[1:23:04] listen dinosaurs don't exist because
[1:23:07] there's no dinosaurs in the Garden of
[1:23:09] Eden
[1:23:10] and your child will say but they found
[1:23:12] bones
[1:23:16] bone big bones
[1:23:19] no these lies they made it up
[1:23:21] but they proved it with science
[1:23:24] sorry this is of the devil
[1:23:28] that's the best way for your child to to
[1:23:30] disbelieve in you and walk away from
[1:23:33] Faith altogether
[1:23:35] because you're still upholding some
[1:23:37] fantasy
[1:23:38] right
[1:23:39] you're not getting into the word
[1:23:41] so these are the words of Christ he says
[1:23:43] the the religious people the Pharisees
[1:23:45] they put a burden on the people too
[1:23:48] heavy for the people to bear and the
[1:23:51] religious leaders themselves won't even
[1:23:52] move a finger
[1:23:54] to hold that burden
[1:23:56] that's in Matthew chapter 3.
[1:23:58] so in the place of Truth you teach
[1:24:01] tradition culture observing of days and
[1:24:04] times and years that's Galatians 4 and
[1:24:06] you'll lead the minds of people to
[1:24:07] bondage instead of freedom
[1:24:09] this was the biggest trial of the Lord
[1:24:12] Jesus Christ himself to get people to
[1:24:13] believe you want to know that it's all
[1:24:15] about belief
[1:24:17] belief
[1:24:18] John 4 48
[1:24:20] if you have your Bibles you can read
[1:24:22] then say Jesus unto him except you see
[1:24:25] signs and wonders you will not believe
[1:24:28] John 8 45 46 and because I tell you the
[1:24:31] truth you believe me not
[1:24:36] because I tell you the truth you believe
[1:24:38] me not
[1:24:39] it's like people were more willing to
[1:24:41] believe a lie
[1:24:43] which of you convinced me of sin in
[1:24:45] other words would one of you can accuse
[1:24:47] me
[1:24:48] correctly of sin and if I say the truth
[1:24:51] why do you not believe me
[1:24:53] this is the Lord himself asking Society
[1:24:56] John 3 12 if I have told you Earthly
[1:24:59] things and you believe not how shall you
[1:25:02] believe if I tell you of heavenly things
[1:25:05] uh what I'm telling you is the Messiah
[1:25:07] himself was having trouble getting
[1:25:10] people to believe
[1:25:12] John 6 35-36 and Jesus said unto them I
[1:25:16] am the bread of life he that cometh to
[1:25:18] me shall never hunger he that believeth
[1:25:19] on me shall never thirst but I say unto
[1:25:22] you that you also have seen me and
[1:25:24] believe not
[1:25:25] so those people who say seeing is
[1:25:27] believing you have seen the Messiah and
[1:25:29] you believe not
[1:25:30] John 12 47 48 If any man hear my words
[1:25:34] and believe not I judge him not for I
[1:25:37] come not to judge the world but to save
[1:25:38] the world he that rejected me and
[1:25:40] received my words hath one that judgeth
[1:25:43] him the word that I have spoken the same
[1:25:46] shall judge him in the last day it will
[1:25:47] be the word the judges
[1:25:50] Mark 16 14 afterward he appeared unto
[1:25:54] the 11 as they sat at meat and operated
[1:25:57] them that means he was uh chastising him
[1:26:00] criticizing them uh would they he
[1:26:03] upgraded them with their unbelief and
[1:26:05] Hardness of Heart the disciples
[1:26:09] because they believed not he's he's
[1:26:11] talking about after the resurrection
[1:26:14] Mark 16 upgrading them because they
[1:26:17] believed not after the resurrection
[1:26:21] because they believed not them which had
[1:26:24] seen him after he was risen because
[1:26:25] people came and said hey the seven seal
[1:26:28] is open
[1:26:30] what
[1:26:32] we know we don't under we don't believe
[1:26:34] that
[1:26:35] he's a
[1:26:38] what are you mad why would you
[1:26:41] who are you
[1:26:43] you're just uh you're just a woman Mary
[1:26:46] Magdalene why should you I'm I am one of
[1:26:50] the favorite disciples he should have
[1:26:52] appeared to me first the revelation of
[1:26:53] the 17 should have come to me first
[1:26:57] because I've read in this message longer
[1:27:00] because that matters
[1:27:04] that's what Christ criticized them for
[1:27:06] they had this disarray remember the two
[1:27:08] on the main the way to Emmaus they were
[1:27:10] saying and what of these people some
[1:27:12] said there are some women of our company
[1:27:14] who said they've seen him others said
[1:27:16] they saw angels others said they saw
[1:27:18] this we don't know what to believe
[1:27:21] what was his words oh fools
[1:27:25] slow of heart
[1:27:28] Mark 6 5-6 and he could do he could
[1:27:32] there do no Mighty work save that he
[1:27:36] laid his hands upon a few sick folk and
[1:27:38] heal them and he marveled because of
[1:27:41] their unbelief that means the Messiah
[1:27:43] himself is standing there the Creator
[1:27:46] the word made flesh and he could do no
[1:27:50] great Miracles because of the amount of
[1:27:52] unbelief
[1:27:55] I are you understanding your Bible
[1:27:59] God's power was not even going to move
[1:28:01] because of the amount of unbelief he
[1:28:03] found amongst the people
[1:28:07] that's the problem I want to break that
[1:28:09] down to you before we close
[1:28:12] Christ had to teach to help remove
[1:28:16] unbelief I want to ask you
[1:28:18] how can we ever remove unbelief from
[1:28:21] society
[1:28:23] do you even know what an unbeliever is
[1:28:28] teaching is meant to make the truth
[1:28:32] plain
[1:28:35] teaching is meant to make it's not meant
[1:28:37] to confuse people it's supposed to bring
[1:28:39] the truth right
[1:28:40] those who were able to believe by
[1:28:43] hearing the word received the blessing
[1:28:45] of knowing who God really was in that
[1:28:48] time those who believe by hearing the
[1:28:51] truth right listen remember the the
[1:28:54] Samaritan uh the Samaritan woman who met
[1:28:57] Jesus by the well
[1:28:59] this is
[1:29:00] you know oftentimes we just talk about
[1:29:05] the conversation between Christ and the
[1:29:06] woman at the well
[1:29:08] we never get to the part where she goes
[1:29:10] off into the town afterwards and say
[1:29:11] come see a man who told me everything
[1:29:13] and she doesn't stop testifying
[1:29:15] testifying and some people heard her and
[1:29:17] begin to believe what she was saying
[1:29:20] verse 39-42 and many of the Samaritans
[1:29:24] of that City believed on him for the
[1:29:27] saying of the woman
[1:29:28] which testified
[1:29:30] he told me all that ever I did people
[1:29:33] started believing just because of her
[1:29:35] testimony verse 40. so when the
[1:29:38] Samaritans would come unto him they
[1:29:41] besought him they looked for him that
[1:29:43] and they they asked him to to stay with
[1:29:45] them to teach them
[1:29:46] and he Abode there two days we never
[1:29:49] usually talk about this he stayed with
[1:29:51] the Samaritans two days
[1:29:53] and verse 41 and many more believed
[1:29:56] because of his own word
[1:29:59] not the lady's word because of his own
[1:30:02] word
[1:30:04] and said unto the woman those people now
[1:30:07] said to the woman now we believe not
[1:30:09] because of thy saying but we have heard
[1:30:12] for ourselves and know that this is
[1:30:15] indeed the Christ the savior of the
[1:30:17] world
[1:30:17] we have heard him and we believe for
[1:30:19] ourselves not just because someone told
[1:30:21] us
[1:30:22] they became believers
[1:30:26] imagine he couldn't even find this faith
[1:30:30] in his own hometown
[1:30:34] and why because the people from the
[1:30:36] hometown said Dad talk to you Joseph and
[1:30:39] Mary's son the carpenter
[1:30:42] why should we believe you
[1:30:44] right
[1:30:46] it's it's like humans think they can
[1:30:50] uh
[1:30:52] make value to to truth based on what
[1:30:56] they know
[1:30:59] all right so let's close this down many
[1:31:01] people who do not understand what the
[1:31:04] message is
[1:31:05] assume the message is another religion
[1:31:08] or cultish set of rules
[1:31:11] it isn't
[1:31:13] though unfortunately many miserable
[1:31:15] people who think they understand the
[1:31:17] message live it that way like a cult to
[1:31:20] their own shame
[1:31:22] what is commonly known as the message in
[1:31:26] our churches consists of two basic parts
[1:31:29] right so what is the message the message
[1:31:31] is the unraveling of it's two parts to
[1:31:33] the message unraveling all the false
[1:31:36] truth we once believed in
[1:31:38] and the second parties introducing the
[1:31:41] truth that we should believe
[1:31:43] that's the message right so that means
[1:31:46] exposing all that Christianity once
[1:31:49] believed that is not true and not
[1:31:51] biblical and then revealing what is true
[1:31:54] and biblical
[1:31:55] right so it's so simple and yet so
[1:31:59] powerful in that all that it does for us
[1:32:02] is restores the ability to believe again
[1:32:06] and no truth when we see it
[1:32:10] that's what the message is now I didn't
[1:32:13] even know what way to to round up the
[1:32:16] series benefits of the message
[1:32:18] but I want to in this last few minutes
[1:32:22] show you what the benefits of the
[1:32:24] message really is
[1:32:27] and it's you can put it in one simple
[1:32:29] line
[1:32:30] the message makes you a believer
[1:32:35] and I want to show you how valuable it
[1:32:38] is to be a believer
[1:32:40] because
[1:32:42] you lived your life as an unbeliever
[1:32:45] and everyone in this world is living
[1:32:47] their lives as unbelievers
[1:32:50] okay let's break that down
[1:32:53] the message
[1:32:55] gives you the ability to believe again
[1:32:58] and you say to me but also I always
[1:33:01] believed I always believed something
[1:33:04] I always believe I believe something
[1:33:06] before
[1:33:08] the truth is you didn't
[1:33:11] you were an unbeliever
[1:33:13] you didn't have the ability to believe
[1:33:16] you reasoned you agreed with things for
[1:33:20] the sake of peace and Harmony or you
[1:33:23] agreed with things because they kind of
[1:33:24] worked for you but did you believe it
[1:33:28] you cannot believe something unless you
[1:33:31] are physically a believer the message
[1:33:34] makes you biologically a believer
[1:33:42] right there's the problem being able to
[1:33:45] believe beyond what Society sees gives
[1:33:49] us the ability in other words what is
[1:33:51] the message the message introduces you
[1:33:53] to something you can believe beyond what
[1:33:56] Society sees and when you are able to do
[1:33:59] that
[1:34:00] you are able to be more than what
[1:34:02] Society is
[1:34:04] amen
[1:34:05] for there to be let me give an example
[1:34:07] for there to be a happy marriage
[1:34:11] two people have to believe in each other
[1:34:17] it's not even love
[1:34:20] you can love anything you can love
[1:34:22] anybody you can love a lot of people
[1:34:25] I can ask two people in a marriage
[1:34:27] counseling
[1:34:29] do you love each other yes you know I
[1:34:31] love you I love her I love him I asked
[1:34:34] this question do you believe in them
[1:34:39] and that's a problem
[1:34:42] because if there's unbelief in a
[1:34:45] marriage in a relationship
[1:34:48] it's not in harmony
[1:34:50] believing in God makes you able to
[1:34:54] believe in your wife
[1:34:57] it makes you a biological believer
[1:35:00] that's the benefits of the message
[1:35:04] I know you don't even recognize the
[1:35:07] value in it yet people don't
[1:35:10] for there to be a happy marriage
[1:35:12] requires two people to believe in each
[1:35:14] other unbelief let's think about what
[1:35:16] does unbelief do if you have unbelief
[1:35:18] for your wife or unbelief for your
[1:35:20] husband what does it bring
[1:35:22] distrust
[1:35:23] jealousy
[1:35:25] selfishness
[1:35:26] Pride arrogance and a whole lot of other
[1:35:31] negative attributes of unbelief
[1:35:37] if you want to restore relationship you
[1:35:39] restore belief in the person
[1:35:41] you can't make someone love you I mean
[1:35:44] how many chocolates and teddy bears can
[1:35:45] you possibly buy
[1:35:47] roses carnations I think those are for
[1:35:51] death I'm not sure carnations or lilies
[1:35:54] I don't know but anyway it doesn't
[1:35:55] matter what and you know flowers doesn't
[1:35:57] work for some people because we have
[1:35:59] allergies
[1:36:00] it's not going to make people love you
[1:36:02] you can buy gifts until you blew in the
[1:36:04] face or until you crack your bank
[1:36:06] account it's not going to make someone
[1:36:08] love you
[1:36:09] there has to be belief
[1:36:12] how do you get belief back when belief
[1:36:15] was taken away by Original Sin
[1:36:19] if you can't believe God you can't
[1:36:22] believe anything
[1:36:24] you only reason
[1:36:28] belief brings now as unbelief brings
[1:36:30] distrust jealousy and all those things
[1:36:32] attributes of unbelief what are the
[1:36:34] attributes of belief
[1:36:36] what are the attributes of believing
[1:36:39] Trust
[1:36:40] Grace
[1:36:42] forgiveness
[1:36:45] and so much more leads to true love in a
[1:36:48] marriage
[1:36:51] with belief
[1:36:52] with belief there are no regrets in life
[1:36:55] no fear of death No Lack of wisdom no
[1:36:59] end to possibilities
[1:37:02] if you believe
[1:37:03] there's no end to possibilities life can
[1:37:07] Crush around you but because you believe
[1:37:09] in each other
[1:37:10] it's honey it's you and me against the
[1:37:12] whole world
[1:37:13] no matter what happens we will survive
[1:37:15] we will make life work
[1:37:18] do you see how that is disappearing
[1:37:19] today I remember those old times when
[1:37:23] you just had two people two people in a
[1:37:26] in a plot of land
[1:37:28] and in one year there's a house there
[1:37:30] Cottage wooden Cottage and the next
[1:37:32] thing there's some animals and you talk
[1:37:34] about hardships freezing cold Winters no
[1:37:37] electricity no running water anywhere
[1:37:39] and the next thing you know just two
[1:37:42] people who believe in each other
[1:37:44] and a generation begins
[1:37:47] what's happening today
[1:37:49] no we can't make it we don't have enough
[1:37:52] in the bank we don't have a bond we
[1:37:55] don't have this we don't have that what
[1:37:56] is all that we don't we don't we don't
[1:37:58] have we don't have we don't have that's
[1:37:59] unbelief
[1:38:01] because belief has endless possibilities
[1:38:08] this is the reason that living with
[1:38:10] unbelief is sin against God and a sin
[1:38:13] against nature and yourself
[1:38:18] Amen in conclusion our belief is what
[1:38:22] defines who we are in every aspect of
[1:38:25] life and determines our happiness in
[1:38:28] life
[1:38:29] we do not need individual consciences
[1:38:32] those three philosophies we have the
[1:38:34] mind of Christ
[1:38:36] why do I need my individual conscience
[1:38:38] when I have the mind of Christ I have
[1:38:40] his conscience
[1:38:42] right we do not need politics and the
[1:38:44] rule of law the government is upon his
[1:38:46] shoulder
[1:38:47] if I can believe the government on his
[1:38:50] shoulder following the laws of this land
[1:38:52] is nothing for me
[1:38:54] because I respect his government I
[1:38:56] believe in his government
[1:38:58] so applying these laws of the land to me
[1:39:01] is is nothing it's easy I don't have a
[1:39:04] problem with it I don't have a problem
[1:39:06] falling in line with it because falling
[1:39:08] in line with him is far more important
[1:39:10] than anything else
[1:39:13] we don't need religion to guide us
[1:39:15] because we understand his divine nature
[1:39:19] what religion can possibly teach me when
[1:39:22] I have his holy spirit
[1:39:25] what religion what message church with
[1:39:27] its Theory can top the divine nature in
[1:39:31] me
[1:39:33] nothing there's no church with its laws
[1:39:35] that can teach me anything when I have
[1:39:37] his divine nature his holy spirit
[1:39:39] because the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:41] made way for the person of Christ in me
[1:39:44] nobody has to police me because when I
[1:39:47] do something wrong I police myself
[1:39:52] nobody's going to force me to go
[1:39:54] apologize to my wife or apologize to my
[1:39:56] husband or make things right because
[1:39:58] inside of me that Holy Spirit is telling
[1:40:00] me what to do it's leading me it's
[1:40:02] guiding me because the word says sons of
[1:40:04] God are led by the spirit of God
[1:40:07] we don't require religion we don't
[1:40:10] require people or a church to Define and
[1:40:13] Rule what we do neither do I as a pastor
[1:40:16] dictate to you you judge people what to
[1:40:18] do to follow my rules
[1:40:20] if I had to do that I'm I'm going
[1:40:23] against the very thing I believe in
[1:40:26] there is a difference between believing
[1:40:28] and being convinced of something
[1:40:32] our belief is what saves us
[1:40:36] our belief is what heals us
[1:40:39] our belief is more important to us than
[1:40:41] anything else we believe in God and his
[1:40:45] word and that is what guides our
[1:40:48] thoughts our intentions our reasoning
[1:40:50] our communication
[1:40:52] our belief is not in modern systems our
[1:40:56] belief is in the word first
[1:40:59] so what I'm saying to you is
[1:41:01] if everybody in the world believed in
[1:41:05] the word of God
[1:41:06] you wouldn't need any systems
[1:41:11] it's that simple
[1:41:13] why do we need systems because we're
[1:41:16] trying to govern unbelievers
[1:41:21] and that's why systems keep failing and
[1:41:23] have to keep readjusting
[1:41:27] being believers
[1:41:32] we are born every one of us with I am
[1:41:34] closing now we are born with a blank
[1:41:36] slate all of you are a blank slate when
[1:41:38] you are born you're a baby
[1:41:40] you're a baby with a clean mind you know
[1:41:42] nothing about the world you know nothing
[1:41:44] about you don't know sin you don't know
[1:41:45] righteousness you don't know anything
[1:41:46] you don't even know God you don't know
[1:41:48] religion you don't know Christianity
[1:41:50] nothing you're just a blank slate you're
[1:41:52] a blank page right
[1:41:55] and you come as a blank slit and the
[1:41:58] world turns you into
[1:42:00] a doubter a liar a fearful person full
[1:42:04] of anxiety and woes from the first five
[1:42:06] years of your life
[1:42:09] imagine taking a blank page and
[1:42:10] scribbling all over that's what they do
[1:42:13] to children today
[1:42:14] that's what the world does just
[1:42:16] scribbling nonsense all over this
[1:42:19] beautiful blank page
[1:42:21] believe in the word makes us believers
[1:42:25] now I want you to think about that we so
[1:42:28] casually call ourselves Believers you
[1:42:30] know when some young man tells me you
[1:42:32] know brother Al I meant to go and I
[1:42:34] asked him well is she a believer
[1:42:36] they'll say well yes she's a Believer
[1:42:39] what makes her a believer the fact that
[1:42:41] she's in a message Church
[1:42:45] what's a Believer we believe in William
[1:42:47] Branham that doesn't make you a believer
[1:42:50] that makes you reason that William
[1:42:52] branham's message works for you
[1:42:55] what makes a believer
[1:42:59] does she believe in the word
[1:43:03] does he believe in the word
[1:43:08] I want you to know
[1:43:10] being a Believer is not even related to
[1:43:13] the message
[1:43:15] it's a natural biological condition
[1:43:19] men used to be at one time believers
[1:43:22] they lost being Believers because of the
[1:43:24] original sin
[1:43:26] and then biologically we became
[1:43:28] unbelievers we come into this world
[1:43:31] filled with doubt
[1:43:33] suspicion
[1:43:36] can you imagine what life would be like
[1:43:38] if every one of us were born
[1:43:39] biologically believers
[1:43:43] a child would never need flight or fight
[1:43:47] response
[1:43:50] do you understand that fight or flight
[1:43:52] response is a is a biological condition
[1:43:55] from unbelief
[1:43:58] if a dog's in front of you
[1:44:01] and you were Adam what were you going to
[1:44:03] do
[1:44:04] because you're an unbeliever your
[1:44:06] kidneys kick out adrenaline it hits your
[1:44:09] brain and you start sweating at the
[1:44:11] hands and then you either stand to fight
[1:44:12] the dog or you run but if you're a
[1:44:14] Believer you stand still
[1:44:17] okay
[1:44:20] biologically that dog recognizes hold on
[1:44:23] this guy is the apex predator
[1:44:27] I can't be growling at him he'll take me
[1:44:30] out the dog is like you can have a
[1:44:32] Chihuahua thinking it can take you out
[1:44:34] today
[1:44:36] have you seen them they have no respect
[1:44:38] for mankind there's little things you
[1:44:40] can fit in the shoebox
[1:44:42] stand there with I tell you I once I had
[1:44:44] these two American staffies muscular big
[1:44:49] dogs and we went to puppy school and
[1:44:51] this little Chihuahua must have been
[1:44:52] like that it had a temper like I
[1:44:56] that thing couldn't even be socialized
[1:44:59] it was so aggressive and all you could
[1:45:01] do was so angry it was choking on its
[1:45:03] own self
[1:45:05] I was so surprised that a little thing
[1:45:07] like this could be so angry
[1:45:12] you meet people like that nowadays
[1:45:13] frothing at the mouth
[1:45:16] so angry because someone took their
[1:45:19] place or something in the queue
[1:45:25] if I ask you right now
[1:45:28] what is there in the world I want you
[1:45:30] all just peacefully quietly
[1:45:32] consider this question
[1:45:35] what is there in the world right now
[1:45:37] that you actually wholly believe in
[1:45:44] what will your answer be
[1:45:46] you don't need to answer me just think
[1:45:48] about it
[1:45:49] what in the world I actually asked my
[1:45:51] son this yesterday just to do the test
[1:45:55] is it science
[1:45:58] is it education
[1:46:00] name one thing in the world that you
[1:46:03] actually wholly believe in
[1:46:10] you'll find there is nothing
[1:46:15] and you end up with
[1:46:18] if you believe in your wife it's going
[1:46:20] to be a wife your husband
[1:46:23] your parents
[1:46:25] the word of God without
[1:46:27] but anything else
[1:46:29] nothing you just realize you don't
[1:46:32] believe in anything else you cannot
[1:46:34] believe in anything else
[1:46:39] or to a point you you have something
[1:46:42] that you think will work for you until
[1:46:45] but you're in the back of your mind you
[1:46:47] have this anxiety that it's eventually
[1:46:49] going to break
[1:46:50] it's eventually going to let you down
[1:46:52] you know what I'm talking about
[1:46:56] do you wholly believe in yourself
[1:47:03] is that possible
[1:47:05] to believe that person looking back at
[1:47:07] you in the mirror
[1:47:11] if I asked you how many of you wholly
[1:47:14] believe in your spouse your husband your
[1:47:16] wife many of you will not be able to
[1:47:18] answer because you are taught to doubt
[1:47:20] by the Fallen nature
[1:47:26] to be jealous to be envious to keep
[1:47:28] checking on them to keep
[1:47:30] seeing what they do where they are who
[1:47:32] they're being with them who they're
[1:47:33] phoning who they're visiting
[1:47:36] it's like you've been programmed from
[1:47:38] the time you're a teenager and you
[1:47:40] you're dating someone to be neurotic
[1:47:43] nervous
[1:47:45] uh like distrustful like they're always
[1:47:48] going to let you down
[1:47:50] am I right
[1:47:52] yes
[1:47:57] in your heart right now to yourself name
[1:48:00] one thing in this world that you wholly
[1:48:02] believe in and you can place 100 faith
[1:48:04] in it
[1:48:08] you say to me well brother oh what's the
[1:48:10] big deal about believing I mean why do
[1:48:12] we have to believe anyway
[1:48:14] why do we have to place faith in
[1:48:15] anything
[1:48:17] because we are better people when we
[1:48:20] believe
[1:48:23] because we find less you know what
[1:48:26] happens when you believe
[1:48:28] you find less need to control everything
[1:48:33] you know half the time you're frustrated
[1:48:35] because you want to control everything
[1:48:38] it's a it's a flaw to think you can
[1:48:40] control everything
[1:48:42] I'm standing here in front of you using
[1:48:45] my body I have no control over my heart
[1:48:48] right now
[1:48:49] could stop at any moment
[1:48:51] should I be anxious about it
[1:48:54] should I do everything in my power to
[1:48:57] kind of control my heart which I can't
[1:48:58] even touch with my finger
[1:49:02] how should it govern my life
[1:49:05] and that's the problem with unbelief
[1:49:07] unbelief gives you the need to control
[1:49:10] everything and the truth is control is
[1:49:12] an illusion you can't control everything
[1:49:16] and you're stressing yourself out every
[1:49:17] day being an unbeliever is biological
[1:49:23] it's not about the message
[1:49:28] many successful people find that finding
[1:49:31] way you look we become better people if
[1:49:34] we believe because we find
[1:49:36] if you if you feel in your life I don't
[1:49:39] need to control everything you find more
[1:49:41] freedom you find more air to breathe
[1:49:44] because we lose anxiety and depression
[1:49:46] when we believe more because we are
[1:49:49] happy you know what happens if you try
[1:49:51] to control everybody's life
[1:49:53] you're the one who gets stressed if you
[1:49:56] trust them with their own life let them
[1:49:57] make the mistake Let Them Fall let them
[1:49:59] crack their heads when they are come to
[1:50:01] you then you pick them up and put them
[1:50:03] right again but if you're going to live
[1:50:05] your life trying to protect them every
[1:50:06] time they fall
[1:50:08] you aren't going to go insane
[1:50:12] it's an illusion to think you can
[1:50:13] control everybody
[1:50:16] we are happier people when we believe
[1:50:20] when we believe enough to trust the next
[1:50:23] person listen just remember if you go
[1:50:25] and you make a mistake I'm still here
[1:50:27] for you I'll never stop loving you I'll
[1:50:29] still be here for you when you come back
[1:50:31] it won't change who you are to me but
[1:50:33] the moment you disbelieve God's word
[1:50:35] that separates us
[1:50:38] that's it that separates us because you
[1:50:40] start losing belief you believe in me
[1:50:43] and I believe in you we have a better
[1:50:45] relationship
[1:50:47] many successful people
[1:50:49] find that finding ways to be positive
[1:50:51] you know all the CEOs of the world what
[1:50:54] do you call us some 500 what is that
[1:50:57] Fortune 500 people oh almost at Fashion
[1:51:00] 500. Fortune 500 people and all these
[1:51:04] they all write books and they all write
[1:51:06] about positivity and thinking and
[1:51:09] believing in yourself and knowing you
[1:51:11] can do it you've heard all that
[1:51:13] they give the best talks in that
[1:51:16] and then they charge you thousands for
[1:51:18] those talks
[1:51:19] but it really works for them for a long
[1:51:22] time and it leads to gnosticism
[1:51:26] right it's where you start thinking too
[1:51:28] much of yourself can you really believe
[1:51:30] in yourself
[1:51:32] can you fully believe in this I just
[1:51:34] told you I can't even control my own
[1:51:36] heart my own breathing right now
[1:51:38] I can't even control my own brain right
[1:51:41] now
[1:51:41] how do I believe in myself wholly
[1:51:44] believe in myself
[1:51:45] it's another illusion
[1:51:47] to stand in the mirror and say
[1:51:50] you can do it today
[1:51:51] with music playing it's better with
[1:51:54] music playing
[1:51:55] you can do it
[1:51:58] that's not believing that's bluffing
[1:52:00] yourself that's trying to have positive
[1:52:02] thoughts you can only truly believe in
[1:52:06] who you are when you know your place in
[1:52:08] Christ
[1:52:09] otherwise you can't because you are lost
[1:52:13] in a world that is so full of
[1:52:15] unbelievers you can't find your place
[1:52:17] anywhere watch a child who goes to a new
[1:52:20] school for the first time watch yourself
[1:52:21] go to a new job for the first time watch
[1:52:24] yourself go find a new client for the
[1:52:26] first time every time you think you're
[1:52:28] so positive and so great you're standing
[1:52:31] with something for the first experience
[1:52:32] and your hands are sweating your brow is
[1:52:34] sweating your stomach is churning you
[1:52:36] actually have to miss a meal because you
[1:52:37] were so nervous even though you have
[1:52:39] this great confident CEO
[1:52:42] it's an illusion
[1:52:46] it leads to narcissism eventually that
[1:52:48] person starts looking at himself in the
[1:52:49] mirror and start admiring himself for
[1:52:51] everything that goes right he gets a an
[1:52:54] award when something goes wrong what
[1:52:56] does he do blames someone else
[1:52:59] you have to if you're someone who
[1:53:01] believes in yourself in this world when
[1:53:03] things go wrong you have to find someone
[1:53:05] else to blame that's how narcissism
[1:53:07] works
[1:53:08] that's how belief in yourself works
[1:53:10] that's the part they don't write in
[1:53:12] their books
[1:53:14] you always have to blame someone else
[1:53:16] for the wrong things that happen
[1:53:19] all of them don't care who they are
[1:53:21] Trump just won that one
[1:53:24] Joe Biden
[1:53:25] or silver I'm a poissa all of them
[1:53:27] fantastic great men governing the
[1:53:29] country wearing the best suits speaking
[1:53:31] the best way possible great successes
[1:53:34] all the wrong things that everyone
[1:53:35] else's fault not mine
[1:53:38] narcissism
[1:53:40] don't fool yourself with that
[1:53:43] being a believer
[1:53:45] is being christ-like
[1:53:49] so you see even though all of us in this
[1:53:52] world may have a little belief in
[1:53:53] something and place a little faith in
[1:53:55] something we are much more unbelievers
[1:53:58] than believers
[1:54:00] and it's killing our society
[1:54:03] more and more we are not trusting in
[1:54:05] society not trusting in government not
[1:54:07] trusting in the systems that govern us
[1:54:09] not trusting friends and family not
[1:54:12] trusting in ourselves
[1:54:13] in the message Jesus Christ is saying
[1:54:15] yesterday today and forever
[1:54:17] what is sin there's only one sin it's
[1:54:19] unbelief he that believeth not is
[1:54:20] condemned already how we know they are
[1:54:23] only two faith and unbelief you're on
[1:54:25] one side if you're a Believer you don't
[1:54:27] smoke drink commit adultery but because
[1:54:29] you don't just don't make you a believer
[1:54:32] no sir it's just the attribute the
[1:54:33] prophet is saying because you don't
[1:54:35] drink smoke commit adultery that doesn't
[1:54:37] make you a believer
[1:54:39] amen
[1:54:41] it still makes you
[1:54:43] it still doesn't make you a Believer if
[1:54:46] you are not doing things what makes you
[1:54:48] a Believer as long as you are just a
[1:54:50] human being without the Holy Ghost every
[1:54:53] day of your life you are plagued by
[1:54:55] unbelief lack of faith and distrust
[1:54:59] in the message approach to God I think
[1:55:01] this is our last quote
[1:55:03] he says if I started to go home this
[1:55:06] afternoon and went cut across the fields
[1:55:08] I find myself sunk down in a mud puddle
[1:55:10] somewhere the highway hasn't approached
[1:55:13] Jeffersonville and I must go the way up
[1:55:15] the highway it's easy running if you'll
[1:55:17] just get in the road die out to self
[1:55:19] come through the blood of Christ then
[1:55:21] you approach the father and he will give
[1:55:23] you the holy spirit that will make you a
[1:55:26] believer
[1:55:28] cause it's not you that's believing
[1:55:31] anymore is the holy spirit in you your
[1:55:34] Nature has changed
[1:55:37] our belief versus modern systems I don't
[1:55:40] get into my car every morning hoping the
[1:55:43] other person has individual conscience
[1:55:45] religion and and he's protecting himself
[1:55:49] from the law or he respects the law I
[1:55:51] don't even care about that
[1:55:53] my faith is in God my belief is in him
[1:55:56] if it's my time to go I'm not afraid
[1:56:00] I'm going to live my life every day
[1:56:02] making what I do worth the while for his
[1:56:06] purpose and who cares about all other
[1:56:08] purposes
[1:56:11] so if something goes wrong in my life in
[1:56:16] my home I know I believe in my wife I
[1:56:19] believe in my children I believe we can
[1:56:21] get it together why do I believe them
[1:56:24] because I was given the ability to
[1:56:26] believe by believing in the word of God
[1:56:29] because I could believe beyond what I
[1:56:31] see how can you believe in someone who
[1:56:34] is another personality altogether
[1:56:37] unless you can believe in God you can
[1:56:39] never believe in another person
[1:56:43] see when you believe the word the
[1:56:46] benefits are unlimited because you
[1:56:48] become a natural believer in something
[1:56:52] you learn to overcome doubt it makes you
[1:56:54] a better person how you become less
[1:56:57] stressed less suspicious more trusting
[1:57:00] in God you'll lose the obsession for
[1:57:03] constant control of everything you don't
[1:57:05] fear death you don't fear negative
[1:57:07] things you have faith in all trials you
[1:57:10] are thankful to God even after a
[1:57:12] terrible trial
[1:57:13] your self-healing ability in your mind
[1:57:16] is enhanced you trust more you forgive
[1:57:20] easier you form better relationships
[1:57:22] that are not fake you don't have doubt
[1:57:25] because you believe your sins are wiped
[1:57:27] clean
[1:57:28] by the only one who matters
[1:57:31] that's what a Believer is
[1:57:34] tell me that person needs any modern
[1:57:36] system of this world to be happy
[1:57:40] it's not someone who thinks they are in
[1:57:42] the message unfortunately today only the
[1:57:46] open book can make a believer
[1:57:49] possible because the everything else is
[1:57:53] over
[1:57:54] Christ was 2 000 years ago Jesus Christ
[1:57:56] two thousand years ago
[1:57:58] people don't need extra Faith to believe
[1:58:00] in Jesus Christ they already know He
[1:58:02] existed all Christians already know in
[1:58:05] Calvary they know the about the blood of
[1:58:07] Christ they know about sanctification
[1:58:08] they know about all that what is it that
[1:58:10] people need what is it today that is
[1:58:13] higher than every other belief it's the
[1:58:15] open book
[1:58:17] in today's life it's not enough to say I
[1:58:21] believe in Jesus Christ and he died for
[1:58:23] my sins
[1:58:24] the highest belief today is the open
[1:58:26] book
[1:58:28] and if you can rise above every other
[1:58:30] belief to that belief you can believe
[1:58:33] beyond anything here in this world
[1:58:35] that's why the message has so much of
[1:58:37] benefits
[1:58:38] can you believe that you can be the word
[1:58:40] made flesh because that's what the open
[1:58:43] book has come to reveal to you can you
[1:58:45] believe that and that you were chosen to
[1:58:48] be the word made flesh
[1:58:51] think of all the doubt you have to
[1:58:52] overcome
[1:58:55] just to come to that state of mind
[1:58:59] you mean me the word made flesh I mean
[1:59:03] the open book come down to me
[1:59:06] think of when you can believe that
[1:59:09] what else can you believe
[1:59:12] you will be transformed within and so
[1:59:15] because we have been transformed into
[1:59:17] Believers we can believe more in God we
[1:59:21] can believe more in our wives in our
[1:59:23] husbands we can believe more in our
[1:59:25] parents young people we can believe more
[1:59:27] in our children parents and we can
[1:59:29] believe more things that matter
[1:59:32] because of that we can make modern
[1:59:34] systems work better for us better than
[1:59:37] it does for everyone else
[1:59:39] according to the way we believe because
[1:59:42] we have the right attitude
[1:59:46] we can have the strength to not let
[1:59:48] modern systems control us we can have
[1:59:51] dominion over all those systems instead
[1:59:54] of them dominating us and taking over
[1:59:56] our minds I believe that that is what we
[1:59:59] are called and chosen to fulfill in this
[2:00:02] world today
[2:00:03] we have to be severely tried and tested
[2:00:05] Saints by the difficulties of these
[2:00:07] systems as everyone in the world
[2:00:10] so I just want to make this plain to you
[2:00:12] make you understand what's happening
[2:00:15] because I don't think it's said often
[2:00:17] enough
[2:00:19] and
[2:00:20] excuse me there's a lot of
[2:00:22] messy churches in the city there's a lot
[2:00:25] of message charges in the world
[2:00:28] but I think this is not said enough
[2:00:30] what are you supposed to do here
[2:00:33] you've gotten to this place where we're
[2:00:35] waiting for the Rapture we're waiting
[2:00:37] for the translation
[2:00:39] we're not
[2:00:42] that's another illusion
[2:00:45] we're not waiting for that
[2:00:47] nobody in the world before in the
[2:00:49] economy of God was waiting for something
[2:00:51] they had to bring it to pass
[2:00:55] waiting is the wrong mentality
[2:00:59] so we got the open book what are we
[2:01:01] supposed to do with it
[2:01:04] what's the purpose why would any
[2:01:06] generation receive the word of God
[2:01:08] there was always a purpose to receiving
[2:01:10] the word
[2:01:11] if Noah received the word there was an
[2:01:13] ark that was going to be manifested if
[2:01:15] Moses received the word there was going
[2:01:16] to be a Mount Sinai there was going to
[2:01:18] be a Shiloh there was going to be a
[2:01:20] tabernacle there was going to be a
[2:01:22] purpose for every word that he sent what
[2:01:24] is our word for
[2:01:27] what are we here for
[2:01:29] to wait for a translation
[2:01:33] that's some weird purpose right
[2:01:36] so let me tell you what's supposed to
[2:01:38] happen
[2:01:39] you are supposed to believe
[2:01:41] Beyond yourself
[2:01:43] you are supposed to go through every
[2:01:46] single marriage trial
[2:01:48] that other people go through and you're
[2:01:50] supposed to overcome it
[2:01:52] by believing
[2:01:54] you are supposed to go through
[2:01:57] parenting problems that pales in
[2:01:59] comparison to other people and you're
[2:02:01] supposed to overcome it
[2:02:03] by believing
[2:02:04] you are supposed to go through financial
[2:02:06] difficulties home difficulties life
[2:02:09] difficulties and you're supposed to
[2:02:11] overcome it by believing
[2:02:14] and overcome it doesn't mean make it so
[2:02:17] much better than I get
[2:02:19] happy
[2:02:21] overcoming means living beyond the
[2:02:24] unbelief it can cause
[2:02:28] that means you might still live with a
[2:02:30] very unhappy situation but it's not
[2:02:32] going to affect your faith
[2:02:36] that's what finding the middle of the
[2:02:38] road is about too
[2:02:40] so we're not running away from it we're
[2:02:42] not running to a better life but if you
[2:02:45] become a Believer you can start
[2:02:47] realizing your life becomes better no
[2:02:50] matter what situations you face
[2:02:54] we have to show that because we are
[2:02:56] believers living with these systems as
[2:02:59] everybody else the system of money will
[2:03:01] not corrupt our Spirits the systems of
[2:03:04] parenting will not take away our
[2:03:06] children's Faith systems will not turn
[2:03:08] us into Political corporate
[2:03:10] hollywood-headed brainwashed beings who
[2:03:13] cannot stand in the day of trouble
[2:03:17] True Believer knows and appreciates the
[2:03:20] wonderful glorious benefits of the
[2:03:23] message
[2:03:25] amen
[2:03:26] the Lord bless you let's bow our heads
[2:03:28] together
