TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I greet you saints in the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is the 23rd of March 2022 and I'm happy to be sharing God's word with you this evening. Uh last week we started a new series how to read the book of revelations and we did a little introduction last week and uh if you remember this is to help people understand how to how to read and understand the book of revelations. So um this is part one, the introduction of the book and the blessing and I trust that it would be a blessing to you this evening. So our scripture reading obviously is going to be from Revelations chapter 1 verse 1:3. But just to begin, let's revise that introduction. This series is to help read the book the right way. By saying that we understand that many people or we know that many people who read the book of revelation cannot make head or tail of what is going on and the amount of false doctrine, misinterpretation, false preaching and teaching that has occurred from this book is tremendous. It's it's too numerous to tell. One of the things we must uh highlight is that what influences your understanding when reading is mostly your background. Your background has trained your mind to comprehend things in a certain way. So what kind of backgrounds are there? There are cultural backgrounds. So if you have a certain type of culture of where you come from and that's just you know culture has got to do with how people react, what their mannerisms are, what their uh traditions are in that place, their dress codes, their manner of speech, um whether the tone of the city or the town or the village is easygoing or highly strong things. All those things have uh um sort of they add to the culture and when you come from those kind of backgrounds when you read the book of revelation it affects your understanding. Uh another background is your religion religious background is really serious. So you can imagine if you come from a very uh liberal religion obviously you're going to have a liberal approach. If you have a a studious religion, you'll come from your background will be a studious approach. Um so apart from if it if you were not in a religion or not as religious uh you have another problem. If you're educated that's a background. If you are not educated that's another background. you know in those cases you have educated people who look down on uh non-educated people and then non-educated people look down on educated people. So it's really quite a quite a thing because no matter what background you come from you have um uh opinions on yourself and on others and on what you read. And it's very notable for a person to admit his shortfalls where he comes from and admit that he has a bias that he is he has a uh a mindset that was controlling for a long time. So there's another background, a message background or a non-ssage background. What does that mean? You know, you can have been in the message and because you're in the message, you seem to have a certain type of boldness or uh courage that uh is actually a little bit wild because you can become somebody who just feels like you've got the right to interpret anything the way you want to because you seem to have the monopoly in the book of Revelation. And that's a dangerous background. And then there are non-ssage background which is somebody who who comes from a church where they didn't even bother with the book of Revelation. It was all about the Psalms, the Proverbs, love everyone, come to church, social gatherings, and nobody bothers with, oh, don't worry about the book of Revelation. It's just a lot of uh, you know, confusing stuff that's for the future. you know Jesus just wants us to love everybody and you know give our offerings and see to the poor and everything will be well that's another background you can imagine someone like that who starts reading the book of revelation immediately they start yawning because they feel it's not important then you have a false doctrine background it's clearly very um dangerous as well because these doctrines begin from the books of Ephesians from the gospels, from the Levitical uh uh books and uh doctrines begin there. And when doctrines dictate how a person must live, how a person must think, what the morality of a person is, then when you read the book of Revelation, of course, it changes your view. There you have a a stay with the ABCs background. That background says, you know, you'll make it to heaven if you just be good, do right, dress right, speak right, you know, and don't worry about all the deep things. Well, that's a background that's going to put you at a disadvantage when it comes to the book of Revelation because you're going to feel again like others that the book of Revelation is not as important. [snorts] If you have a legalistic background, dangerous one as well because you tend to feel like you are more studious. You feel like you are more intellectual, more intelligent, more able. Uh and that that feeling of overconfidence is really what gives you the wrong idea. uh fanatic background. That's dangerous as well because uh that's like somebody who turns everything into such a great m it's almost like you get a high from the the idea of events coming to pass. And you find these fanatics are the ones who everything every year is a sign. Every president of the United States is the sign of the end. Every pope is a sign of the end. Every situation that happens is a sign of the end. We've been hearing signs of the end for the last 50 years because of these kind of people and they've got no idea because God doesn't reveal it to them but they just claim everything is a sign. Uh and of course that's a dangerous background to have to read the book of revelation. Then there is surface level message background. That means people who just you know water baptism serpent seed godhead predestination and um cood and uh you know that's the message. So don't worry about you know um the seals. Don't worry about the thunders. Don't worry about the trumpets. Don't worry about the vials. The trumpets are to Israel. The vials are to the church. So why should we get into it? Uh so don't bother with those books of the Bible. All you need is, you know, Revelations chapter 1 2 3 4 6 is the seals. Uh, Revelations 8:17 seal. Revelations 10, which is the the mighty angel descending. And that's it, you know, and a little bit of the 21 where it's new heavens and new earth. Well, that's it. Nothing more than that surface level message background. Uh and these people are the ones who keep keep you going for like 60 years, you know, watch the Vatican, watch Israel, every single newspaper article, every single thing till the the the point is they even will send you fake news on the Vatican and Israel and be hyped up for a week, three days to a week and then it's dead again. So and you see the uh problem with all these kind of backgrounds because they produce a life that is not overcoming a life that is constantly under pressure life that is constantly recorrecting recorrecting and very very stressful. So then lastly there is this new generations these new generations which are the no clue about the message background. Sorry to say this but this is where we are today. My hope is to allow you to see that without the Holy Ghost, you cannot understand anything you read in the Bible. And if you do understand something in some way, more than likely your understanding is horribly wrong or misinterpreted. So, by the grace of God and by the leadership of the Holy Ghost, let's try to get through the first three verses today. And we'll start with Revelations chapter 1 and verse one. And it reads like this. The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John, who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand. Amen. The Lord add a blessing to his word. I'm so excited to be getting into this book. It's really something that just always excites me to read this book of Revelation. I find one of the first things to do when reading a chapter of the Bible is to break it down. Doesn't matter where it is from, whether it's Leviticus, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, uh any one of the prophets. If you read a chapter, I like to read the entire chapter. When people ask me a question, I like to read the entire chapter, break it down so I can see what the context is in the scripture. It's always the case that several verses in the chapter are a group of a particular theme or topic. For example, three verses may be speaking about a specific thing and then another few verses are of a different topic. In other words, they're speaking of something else. Now, often if it's in one chapter, these different topics, so let's say you have, you know, like 21 verses and um maybe five verses speak on one topic, three verses on another. uh nine verses on another and one verse and another and and they it seems like all these different topics are in one chapter because they coincide somehow with an experience either a singular experience or they contribute to a larger theme or topic and that's the reason why they are in one chapter. All right. So the breakdown of the chapter verse 1 to3 shows us the introduction of the book and the introduction of the author of the words and the scribe that means the writer who works under the author. In this case, the book is written by the the book is dictated or the words and the revelations are given by the Lord Jesus Christ himself and the scribe is actually John the disciple who later became an apostle. Verse four and five is what we call the salutation of the book that is to whom the book is written and in whose authority it is written. Uh um then verse 6-7 uh shows worship acknowledgments um to the one from whom the revelations come um like praise right to the author or um of the book. Verse 8 shows an announcement a a certain specific word from the author himself. And verse 9 to 20 gives us the Patmas vision which is often uh the first Patmas vision often called the Patmas vision um which is the seven golden candlesticks and the sevenfold glory of the person of Christ. So this idea of breakdown of the chapter I learned from the prophet of the hour. He actually did quite a comprehensive breakdown of this chapter. If you read in the message uh the revelation of Jesus Christ uh priest Jeffsonville often called the ROJC series. This is 1960 the 4th of December paragraph 74 he says and now the contents of this first chapter the first verse it is really speaks for itself because it is the revelation of Jesus Christ. Second verse St. John the divine is the scribe and servant. Third verse, the blessings pronounced. Fourth through sixth verse, the salute or salute to the church. The seventh verse, the announcements. The eighth verse, the supreme deity of Jesus Christ. The 9th to the 20th verse, the patmas vision. And also the 14th and 15th verses describe his sevenfold glory of his person. Oh, it's beautiful when we see Christ in his sevenfold personages of his sevenfold beings of his personages in his glorious resurrection. Well, sevenfold beings of his personages. That's something to talk about. but basically speaks of the sort of ranks or characteristics of Christ that sets him apart from any other being on the on the planet any other prophet or wise man or sage or anything. Um so that's the reason why I believe the prophet would use such term the sevenfold beings of his personages not meaning that Christ is made up of seven different people but uh as you get through this the messages on the revelation of Jesus Christ series you get to see that. So from this breakdown we can further break down the first part of this chapter into the most significant part to the reader. The introduction of the book and the blessing of the book and that's what we're going to see in the first three verses or part of it. So it was very important in old times to give someone an introduction. People seem to need the the interest to read the book. And that interest came from knowing the importance of the person who wrote the book. Do you understand what I'm saying? In old days, if you brought a book to somebody, they were going to put it down somewhere and not read it. They needed an interest. And they would open the first page and look at the first page. And obviously, remember in those days, there were no pictures to draw attention. It was just words that was written. There was no color. It was black and white. And um so people seemed like I said to need interest to to open the book and to read it. So the interest would have to be grabbed in the first few words of the book. And one of the the most important things had to do with introducing the author and what the purpose of the book was and so on. So knowing the importance of the person who wrote the book and the reason for the book had to be stated immediately. Now you may not appreciate that today but back then reading was a very difficult slow process. You know all of us can read today. Well most of us can read today. you know, I think in South Africa a lot of us um everyday people can read, you know, fairly well. Uh so but and we can pick up newspapers, we read our phones. Um our children by the time imagine by the time our children are seven years old, they can already read a newspaper. And uh but think back to those days. Think back to 500 years ago. The majority of the world could not read. It was only educated men who could read. Most women could not read. Um so going back a thousand years, 2,000 years, all women could not read. Only men could read and only important men could read. So to read something was a very slow process. And then books were not mass- prodduced. So it was like a treasure for any man to have a book. And so if a parchment of paper or a book was or something was a document was written to that man because he didn't have many books to practice with. One page could take him a whole day just to read that book. I want you to understand why things were written the way they were. So reading was a very difficult slow process. So imagine if parchments came from John physically to the church of Ephesus and how long it would have taken for them to sort through the writings and the visions and to learn it in their own languages and so on. how long it would have taken for them to understand. Reading was a very difficult slow process and required an enormous amount of time to give such time. The introduction had better expressed the importance very well or else a book would be easily discarded. Remember in those days people were up at the crack of dawn and they were sleeping when the sun went down. They were not going to waste their time reading a book or something that wasn't important. So if if John sent a a book with writings that said, uh, well, I just want to describe some of my experiences on the aisle of Patmas, you know, um, well, barely anyone was going to read that. But if that introduction said things like it did say, well, that's when it grabbed the attention of the people. All right? So I trust we understand that. Let us go then phrase by phrase um through uh these verses. First three verses and we'll start with the first and most important phrase. Imagine that the revelation of Jesus Christ. What does that say to you? All right. So with every phrase we want to ask this question. What does this tell us? Okay. And uh so bear this in mind because as we go forward I'm not going to keep asking that question. What does [snorts and clears throat] this tell us? So the book of revelations firstly that phrase says the revelation of Jesus Christ. What does this tell us? It the first thing it tells us is it's not the revelations of John. Things were not revealed to John. Now if you link this with the last phrase of the first verse you will see that it was sent to John right remember that uh it says there uh the revelation of Jesus Christ and the last phrases say and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John. Right? So it was sent to John. It was not the revelation of John. very important if you so we have to rule out that these were John's revelations. I know a lot of people call John the revelator and so on like he was the one revealing but he wasn't. He was the scribe. Revelations were that of Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ himself. If anything, John revealed nothing. He only recorded what was shown him. And truthfully, the way he wrote things out requires deeper understanding. It it it's like the revelations were given to him, he wrote them down, and now they require even more revelation. So, he didn't even really reveal anything. He just told us what he saw, how he interpreted what he saw, and he he just wrote down what he saw. So uh you can ask is this book the revelation of who Jesus is? But the Bible says although there is some of that in here like the sevenfold glory of his person later on in the chapter but this is more about the uncoverings of the work of Christ in the future. Let's read just two um little quotes on that. Now you'll find I because I want to save time and not labor it. I've left out the real chunks of the quotes. I want to just direct your attention to just two simple phrases in the quotes in Revelation Jesus Christ series. Paragraph 79 and paragraph 85. And he says and this book is not the uncovering of so much the person of Jesus Christ. uh and he says a few things but then the last part there he says but it is the revealing of the future of his works in his seven church ages that's coming on in paragraph 85 he says now in this great age that John saw these this revelation was given to him strictly to unveil the specific purpose of Christ what he would be and be like in every age So the first phrase the revelation of Jesus Christ is telling us that the book of revelation is a forewarning or and an awareness given to the church of things that were going to occur in the world and in the church as a result of the faith of God through Christ. We'll explain some of that. And so that's the reason we told you in the introduction last week that this elite book gives the map or the foresight of the events of the injection of the seed of Christ through the ages and the exact effects it would have on the world and the church. Right? Simplifying that it it's a description. It tells you exactly what will happen, what's going to happen, what will happen before, what will happen after uh any situation. And basically it tells you that these things are going to happen because Christ was introduced to some someone or a church or a part of the world. And what will happen just because he was revealed or he was the knowledge of who he was was brought to those people. It's almost like it's a pattern that will never fail. The book of Revelations accurately describes the pattern of effects and it will never fail to happen. It's a very important thing to remember because we'll we can look at the book of revelation and then map out our lives and see why things happen the way they did. Right? So having this means there is no reason to guess because it is all revealed. And I must add this in this revelation was given by visions to John. The reason this book of revelation requires further revelation, in other words, an ear to hear what the spirit's saying, is because it was written by a man 2,000 years ago who was of a different time and mind that we were not familiar with. So we would need a man of our time anointed with the same anointing to put us into the same visions so we can understand properly. The next phrase is which which God gave unto him. So the revelations of Jesus the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him, right? Which God this statement is saying which God gave unto Jesus Christ. And once again, this looks like perfect ammunition given to trinitarians to make their claim. This looks like the son didn't know the revelation and it was given to Jesus by the father. And that's not what this means at all. All right? So the proper understanding of this is you have to understand the dispensations, right? The dispensations, the understanding of those dispensations is required here. So the dispensation of the father was 4,000 years. That is the outpouring or unveiling or revealing of God as God above the people, the I am, the self-existing one, Jehovah. uh that uh part of the attributes of God was was ruling over the people through the ages of conscience which was from Adam through to Noah and Abraham and then the law came in after Abraham right up till Christ. So those two ages of conscience and law those were the dispensation of the father. So from there on from Christ, God purposed that this earth and his people should be redeemed by the manifestation of the son. That means uh the son would then reveal who God is from there on. Son of man, son of God, son of David manifestations. This was a new order of grace. This is why the name of Jesus was above every other name that God was known uh by. So this phrase was very important to state that this revelation is therefore from God himself. When the reader begins to read, he understands this is a revelation given by Jesus Christ and it comes from God himself. For those who at that stage were not certain of the deity of Christ, this these two phrases tell them that Christ was actually deity. The next phrase says to show unto his servants. What is show? Show means to reveal. Why was this revelation given to John? The purpose is so direct and clear. It is to be given to the servants of Christ. This is sounding the alarm of how important it is that ministers of the gospel embrace this book of revelations seeing it is uh the only book of the Bible actually given by Christ himself. All right. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John was not given by Christ. It was people. It was those disciples who recorded the life of Christ as they saw and heard it. But this is the only book where Christ actually dictates the very words, shows the visions, uh tells John what to do. This is actually the one book in the Bible which is given by Christ himself. So why is it given to the servants? That is those who are in the ministry, those who teach, those who testify, those who need to uh uh give this word out to the people, they need to know this. They need to know this book of revelation to be able to be more powerful in their witness of Christ. This book gives that ability. This is spoken in the first verses saints. That's what this phrase means. The next phrase says, things which must shortly come to pass. So this is the phrase that tells us it is uh shortly come to pass. That means things that are still going to happen. It is telling us that is making known future events which the church should take heed to pay attention to as significant. In other words, they should look at what is spoken of in the prophecies and realize that it is significant to the work of the son, right? The work of Christ and the interference of the enemy. All right. So, take heed to what is in the book. Uh, take heed to what comes to pass because it's important to know how to handle the purpose of Christ and to know what the enemy is going to be doing. Okay. The next phrase, he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John. Now, this is a great mystery, right? And I and I'm going to say this from myself. I find it intriguing because we have no idea about it. He sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John. Everything you might hear about this is just speculation. So the best way is to stay as close to what the scripture says about it as possible. This first tells us that John was a real man of God. Right? These men would not even trust their own dreams and visions unless God signified it to them. That means you know John could have seen visions. He could have seen dreams but it was real to him so that he could subscribe it. He could he could write these words but to him he had to know that it came from God himself. And God confirmed it by sending an angel. It was then so it was vindicated. It was confirmed. It was signified with a second witness. It was made double sure because God sent this angel to him. So every good scholar, student of the scripture in that time knew that what it meant in the in the mouth of two witnesses, two or three witnesses, let everything be established. Or where there are where there are two or three gathered in his name, there I am in their midst. They understood what that meant that God only sanctions something when it is vindicated. God only sanctions something new by a vindication. Right? In this case, the visions to John were vindicated by an angel. Therefore, the angel was the vindication. The angel was the signifying. The angel was the sign. All right. In the message revelation to Jesus Christ paragraph of 112, it says, "And it was sent to and signified by his angel unto John." We do not know who the angel was. The Bible doesn't say who the angel was. But we know that it was a prophet because the Bible later said that I Jesus have sent my angel to testify of these things which must shortly come to pass. So this tells us that there was another man on the aisle of Patmas who was guiding John through these visions. Another man. Now which prophet could this be? If this man was a prophet, which prophet was he? We have no idea. There's no name given a more important person than John obviously because what did this man know more about the visions than John? What did this man actually do? Was he the one? How did he signify what God was revealing to John? So, we know for sure that John was seeing the visions. But what role did this man, this angel play in all of these things on the aisle of Patmas? Was this man Christ himself? Legitimate question. So, as it turns out, this man wasn't Christ. He was just a prophet. At the end of the book, where John is so overwhelmed by these revelations, he in inverted commas, he bows down to the angel. That means he was so amazed with this man. Now we know what bow down means. Doesn't mean physically he went down on all on on all fours or knees and hands and head to the ground. Bow down means to uh worship means to submit yourself to something. So that means John was so amazed with this man or the way in which this man had guided John that somehow John became fixated on this angel this prophet bowed down could mean that John became dependent on this man like John imagine the time of the revelation was ending and John was crying please don't go please don't leave me alone just stay with me you know what am I going to do without you so John could have been feeling hopeless now that this man had to leave him John's humanity was showing weakness. So this is what this angel said to him, right? Revelations uh 22 verse 8-9, those of you who know it. And I, John, saw these things and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things. Then said he unto me, "See thou do it not, for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book, worship God." This is not here just to tell us. So listen, okay, we know from this scripture that this man or this angel was a man. It says, "I'm the fellow servant of thy brethren, the prophets." He didn't say, "I'm one of the archangels." He didn't say, "I'm a celestial being. So I, you know, things must have been so amazing to John for him to know who Jesus Christ was and yet to give such reverence to this man who was the vindication of these revelations, right? And yet this man identifies himself and says, "Hold on. I'm not him. I'm not Christ. I'm just one of your fellow servants. I'm one of the prophets. you keep uh who keep the sayings of this book, you worship God. So this is not here just to tell us what happened with John. I believe that this expresses a common occurrence when a true son of God brings revelation, real revelation to people. People will fall down before them. That means they will ascribe more importance to them than they should. People will make more of them than they should. Whether it's brother Brandham or some brother from overseas or brother Alistister from Durban, we are not to be uplifted above the one from whom this revelation comes. It is Christ who gives this grace to us. See to it that you bow down to God only. This is a warning to us ministers too to have the same character as this angel when teaching the book of Revelation. Just because we have this understanding of the book of revelation, we should not make it look like we have so much of importance that we have great importance above everybody else. Right? So the warning to us is do not let the people ascribe more importance to you above Christ. We'll come back to this in greater detail at the end of the series. uh but it is important to point it out. Now let's go to verse two. So the first phrase in verse two says who bear record. So this is speaking of John. Who bear record of the word of God. This gives the credentials of John. That means um why John was so important to be chosen to be the writer the scribe of this book. So it means it gives claim to John as one of the direct witnesses of Christ. He bare record of the word. Now not just direct witness of Christ but he was one of them who was the writers of the gospels of Christ. He was one of the writers the book of John. He was one of the writers of the gospels of Christ. This phrase specifically says when it says he who beare record of the word it says that he was a witness. You know, I I when I think about this, this is so, you know, gives you goosebumps. John actually heard that beautiful voice of the Lord Jesus Christ. He sat in the room and heard the word being spoken from the lips of our savior, from the vocal cords of the son of man. I don't know how many more different beautiful ways to say it, but he bare record of the word of God. Glory to God. And of the testimony of Christ. That's the second phrase. This phrase tells us that John was an eyewitness to all the acts and the life of Christ. And finally, in verse two, and of all things that he saw. That tells us he was not just a witness of Christ. Not just a witness of hearing the word. He was also an eyewitness of the lives of all others around Christ. He was an observer of the public at the time. He was an observer of the church of Israel at the time and Rome during the ministry of Christ. So this phrase along with the two before makes it certain to us that John was an absolutely worthy vessel chosen to receive this book of Revelation. Amen. That's verse two of this great important book. All right, let's get to the last verse, verse three, which I call the blessings. And it starts with blessed is he that readth. Now in the Bible, blessed is he is a phrase commonly referred to in the biatitudes of Matthew chapter 5. Blessed is he may not sound like much to you today because nobody speaks like that anymore, right? I mean, you don't go around saying blessed is he that listens to me. You know, nobody does that. Nobody talks like that today. You might look at the direct translation and think well the word blessed means happy. So happy is he who reads and understands. You know like it's it's so ridiculous that Christians look at this take it as face value like in the biatitudes where it says blessed are the poor [laughter] happy are the poor. That's that's not what it means. It doesn't the poor are not happy with the situation. What does it mean by blessed? Okay. When when you use that word blessed or or say blessed means happy. So happy is the man who reads and understands. You know that's wrong. Why? Because people don't get happy when they read the book of Revelations. This book speaks of judgments and sins and and vials and trumpets and wars. And people don't read this book and say, "Well, where's the popcorn?" And you know, uh where's the music behind it? and let's sit there and enjoy this book. Like, no, you know, they don't do that. This is not a book that makes you happy as in excited. Let's go out for a run now or, you know, let's go out and do something because I feel so incentivized by this book. It just makes me feel happy. No, that's not at all what it means, right? Well, not in the normal sense of happy. So the word blessed or blessed means something else. Think of when blessings began, right? In the Old Testament, when sons like Jacob or Esau went to their fathers and said, "Give me your blessing or bless me, father." It was to do something publicly to indicate that they would receive an honor that would set them above others. In other words, when Jacob went for the blessing of the father, what did he want? He wanted the advantage over Esau. The blessing if it was given to Jacob would give Jacob the advantage over Esau. What advantage? The advantage to the birthright, the advantage to the inheritance. Right? So in other words, an inheritance would be passed to them and because an action was made in the public, the blessing was an was a public display, an action, they would be the those who received this blessing would be respected because this public act proved it. Right? So what a blessing actually did was it gave an advantage to someone over others. Right? So if a man had seven sons and the father gave his blessing to one of them, it gave the advantage of that son over the others. Which means the others would have to respect him. They would have to honor him. they would have to understand that the majority of the inheritance belong to him. So the blessing gives an advantage and the secondary aspect of that. So because you have the advantage, it then brings you happiness eventually. Right? So it said blessed is he that readth. Now what is the word readth? You say well basically blessed is he that reads. It's not just read. It's showing the initiative of interest or the initiative to show interest. Blessed is he who shows the initiative to read. The interest to read. Right? And then the second phrase says, "And they that hear." So blessed therefore is are they that hear the prophecies, the words of this prophecy. That hear the words of this prophecy. here means to understand. So blessed are those who understand what is written in this book. So we'll come across this particular reference a lot in this book of revelation. This phrase he that hath an ear let him hear. This also indicates that if the the Bible says that it means it won't be easy for people to understand this book. Therefore those who understand they would be blessed. Right? The third phrase is and keep those things. So blessed is he that keeps those things which are written therein. This keep those things that doesn't mean okay so keep those things means preserve and observe. So how do you preserve and how do you observe the things in this book. Preserve does not mean keep a safe copy on your shelf for use when necessary. Right? To preserve and observe the sayings of this book is to be in constant fellowship with it. That means to be constantly talking about it, witnessing about it, learning more on it, asking questions on it, fellowshipping in it. Right? That's what it means to preserve or keep the sayings of this book. And the last phrase, for the time is at hand. Right? This was the direct warning that the prophecies were about to start being fulfilled. And so it was. Amen saints. So those are all the phrases of the first three verses of the first chapter of the book of Revelations. So once again, we're going to read those first three verses as it is written and then we're going to tell you what it should read like. Okay. So here it is again. The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John, who bear record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand. Okay. So, we're now going to rewrite this in the way that it should be understood. And so, if you read this correctly, this is how it should read. Revelations 1 1:3. The comprehensive description of the effects and results of Christ being made known to the world, the church and to any individual which came into effect when the invisible father became the visible son was written in this book for the purpose of revealing this truth to all those who believe to be more effectual witnesses of the mystery of God. And it was revealed to the Apostle John and vindicated by a mysterious prophet who guided John through all his visions so he could rightly describe them. Verse two, John was chosen because he was a firsthand witness of the audible words spoken by the Lord Jesus in his three and a half year ministry. And John was a witness of the life and acts of the Lord Jesus in his ministry. And John was a direct witness of the effects of the life of Christ on the public, the church of Israel, the empire of Rome in Judea, and every believer that recognized the Messiah. And verse three reads like this. Every person, family or church, that takes a keen interest in this book and understands the prophecies and remains in constant fellowship and discussion on them, never forgetting to match them to events of the past, present, and future will have a great advantage over all others and will find respect and honor among believers and men of societ. society. So if you were reading the book of Revelations and you read the first three verses, that's what the first three verses should read to you like. Amen. Saints, God bless you. I trust that it will be a blessing. You can run through the notes again and and you know allow the Holy Spirit to reveal it to you. I know it can bring more questions, but more questions brings us more fellowship. So, may the Lord bless you until next week when we get to the next few verses of Revelations chapter 1. Glory be to God. May God be with you. Amen. in an A band.
