[0:00] Amen. While you're standing, we like to
[0:01] read in our Bibles. And we like to read
[0:04] from John chapter 21, the Gospel John 21
[0:09] 15-17.
[0:10] And then we'll also read Luke 22
[0:15] 24-32.
[0:21] So when they had
[0:24] dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon
[0:28] son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than
[0:31] these? He said unto him, Yay, Lord, thou
[0:34] knowest that I love thee? He saith unto
[0:36] him, Feed my lambs? He saith to him
[0:39] again the second time, Simon son of
[0:41] Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto
[0:44] him, Yay, Lord, thou knowest that I love
[0:46] thee. He saith unto him, "Feed my
[0:49] sheep." He said unto him the third time,
[0:52] "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?"
[0:56] Peter was grieved because he said unto
[0:58] him the third time, "Lovest thou me?"
[1:00] And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
[1:03] all things. Thou knowest that I love
[1:05] thee. Jesus sith unto him, feed my
[1:09] sheep. Amen. Luke 22 verse 24-32.
[1:14] I want you to bear um real um
[1:20] uh notice to this scripture because this
[1:23] is where we're going to be taking our
[1:24] text from.
[1:26] And there was also strife among them.
[1:30] Which of them should be accounted the
[1:32] greatest?
[1:33] &gt;&gt; That's the disciples. And he said unto
[1:36] them, "The kings of the Gentiles
[1:38] exercise lordship over them, and they
[1:41] that exercise authority upon them are
[1:44] called benefactors.
[1:46] But you shall not be so. But he that is
[1:49] greatest among you, let him be as the
[1:51] younger, and he that is chief, as he
[1:55] that doth serve. For whether is greater,
[1:58] he that sitth at meat or he that
[2:01] serveth? Is not he that siteth at meat?
[2:05] But I am among you as he that serveth.
[2:09] You are they which have continued with
[2:11] me in my temptations, and I appoint unto
[2:15] you a kingdom, as my father hath
[2:17] appointed unto me, that you may eat and
[2:21] drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit
[2:24] on thrones, judging the 12 tribes of
[2:26] Israel. And the Lord said,"Simon,
[2:30] Simon, behold,
[2:33] Satan hath desired to have you, that he
[2:36] may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed
[2:40] for thee, that thy failed not, and when
[2:44] thou art converted, strengthen thy
[2:47] brethren."
[2:48] &gt;&gt; The Lord add a blessing to his word. You
[2:50] may be seated.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. We'd like to greet you in the
[2:54] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[2:55] Jesus Christ. Certainly good to be uh
[2:58] with you this morning once again and
[3:01] good to be in the house of the Lord and
[3:04] uh sharing God's word and uh I just want
[3:08] to say you know I it's it's been a
[3:11] really difficult week. It's been like uh
[3:13] you know a lot of things we had to do uh
[3:17] counseling and you know studying and
[3:20] getting things together. You you cannot
[3:22] imagine what kind of a time it's been.
[3:26] So, I'm also getting a lot of questions
[3:29] um from people, but uh I don't get to,
[3:33] you know, read the uh comments and the
[3:36] questions that come up on all the
[3:37] YouTube videos now that things are on
[3:39] YouTube and and so the brothers, some of
[3:42] the brothers send the questions to me
[3:44] and I I don't get to do all the
[3:47] questions or answer all the questions
[3:48] and I cannot most of the time I I don't
[3:51] get to um uh know who the people are who
[3:54] are asking questions. that are the
[3:56] comments that are there in the YouTube
[3:58] videos. So, honestly, if I had to take
[4:01] time to read all the stuff, I just
[4:03] wouldn't have time for the work that I
[4:04] have to do. So um but it's quite
[4:09] something to see the um the questions in
[4:13] the hearts of the people and it's so
[4:15] amazing because we've been through all
[4:17] these questions
[4:19] in our question and answer services and
[4:22] I can see it just happening now coming
[4:24] up again in the rest of the world in the
[4:26] message and it's quite incredible that
[4:29] these things are being revived and
[4:32] people's hearts are really searching for
[4:34] the truth. of course with um you know,
[4:37] we know with putting ourselves out there
[4:39] and on the internet, it looks like
[4:41] that's what it's it's going to become
[4:42] now. And um uh we're going to face a lot
[4:46] of battles. We're going to face a lot of
[4:48] criticism, a lot of people coming
[4:50] against you. This is just what it's
[4:52] going to be. And uh if we thought that
[4:54] we're going to sail through this message
[4:56] without criticism, without people
[4:58] speaking against you, coming against
[4:59] your family, you know, then we were we
[5:03] never we signed up for the wrong thing.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; And uh to think that you're in this
[5:08] message and you say you're a follower of
[5:10] Christ and everybody must like you is
[5:13] another crazy thought. you as long as
[5:16] you are speaking the truth, you are
[5:18] going to be rejected by the by the many
[5:22] by the majority and and um that's just
[5:24] the one thing that you always know. I
[5:27] was talking to my family this week and
[5:29] and saying to to my wife as well, you
[5:33] know, when when you tell the truth, uh
[5:35] it's it's not difficult. And I I was
[5:38] saying, you know, people hate this
[5:40] message. People rebel against this
[5:42] message. And and uh and and like what's
[5:45] really the problem? Like what is it that
[5:48] the message is telling you this not
[5:49] true? Like why don't they like the
[5:52] message?
[5:54] It's the truth that you should not
[5:56] smoke. You should not drink. It's the
[5:59] truth you should not do drugs. It's the
[6:01] truth you should you should dress
[6:03] respectfully. It's a truth for a woman
[6:06] that you should not dress seductively.
[6:08] You outside you you're you're married to
[6:10] a man and you should not be attracting
[6:13] the attention of another man
[6:15] deliberately.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. It's the truth that you
[6:19] should uh uh obey the Bible, the word of
[6:22] the Lord. It's everything the message
[6:25] tells you is actually the truth. And
[6:27] that's the part people reject.
[6:30] Why? Because they don't like the truth.
[6:32] Because the truth confronts you. Yeah.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; The truth makes you act. The truth makes
[6:36] you um you know uh um you you cannot
[6:41] unsee it once you've seen it.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; And it's incredible. You know, I I had a
[6:47] chuckle, you know, speaking about the
[6:50] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and
[6:53] uh in the last few um months and um to
[6:58] to see the struggle in people because
[7:00] once you've heard it, you can't unhear
[7:01] it.
[7:03] Now when you're speaking, you're
[7:04] conscious to say Holy Ghost and Holy
[7:06] Spirit. And it's so amazing to see this
[7:10] happening that uh and yet we've been
[7:13] speaking about this for a long time and
[7:15] we're free of that. We're not even
[7:17] conscious of it. We just know what it is
[7:19] and we have no issue with it. But now to
[7:22] watch people struggle to to to see, you
[7:25] know, what is it that I'm going to say
[7:26] right now? What which word do I use
[7:28] right now? And that's not what it was
[7:30] meant to be. You just need to know that
[7:32] you're speaking about the person and
[7:34] you're speaking about the anointing. Two
[7:36] different things. Like uh if if I die,
[7:40] you've just lost the person, but my
[7:42] anointing can still remain.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; People will still remember the words
[7:45] that the actions that I did. They would
[7:47] people would want to live by. I'm not
[7:49] speaking about me personally. I'm
[7:50] speaking about a person like Christ. Um
[7:54] he died, he left, but the anointing of
[7:56] him still remained. Amen.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; And uh so you could live by that
[8:00] anointing or you can live by that
[8:02] person. The word of that person is that
[8:05] person.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:08] So it's really a wonderful thing and we
[8:11] appreciate the Lord. Um and uh there's
[8:14] many trials of the saints um occurring
[8:18] right now. Many people, many true
[8:20] ministers are facing a lot of uh
[8:23] onslaught all over the world and
[8:25] churches are finding it difficult. There
[8:27] are lots of people falling away from the
[8:30] word. It's really really you know
[8:33] tragedy but we're trusting the Lord
[8:35] because he knows all things and he knows
[8:38] that this time would be. So I must say I
[8:41] appreciate um brother Sep reading that
[8:45] psalm this morning and and his prayer.
[8:48] You know you're you're you're studying
[8:50] you're wondering which direction God
[8:52] sends you in. You're following this up.
[8:55] You're, you know, having conversations
[8:57] in the week. You're reading things.
[8:59] You're going to territories you haven't
[9:01] been before. And then, um, you haven't
[9:05] spoken to anyone, and then here comes a
[9:07] brother, reads a psalm, prays the
[9:09] prayer, and everything in there is
[9:11] exactly what you're going to talk about.
[9:13] So, we appreciate the Lord. Amen. So,
[9:16] um,
[9:18] uh, our title, um, in our subject is
[9:22] begotten, born, and then converted. This
[9:24] is going to be part two and uh our title
[9:27] is going to be strengthening your
[9:29] brethren or strengthen your brethren.
[9:32] Amen. So I thought I'm thinking you know
[9:35] this is this is a good thing that that
[9:37] can be a short service you know because
[9:40] we need to keep it short. So uh I hope
[9:44] it's going to be that because I mean how
[9:46] much can you talk about strengthening
[9:47] your brethren? thought was in my mind,
[9:50] how are we going to work this out? But
[9:52] uh so last week after the service, I was
[9:54] speaking to some of the brothers and I
[9:57] was asked, you know, brother, you need
[9:59] to kind of flesh this out a little bit
[10:02] more. You know, what what the meaning of
[10:04] conversion is. We can understand
[10:06] begotten, we can understand being born.
[10:08] Um conversion, you need to flesh it out.
[10:11] You need to speak more about that. We
[10:13] need to make this a little bit more
[10:15] relatable to the people, even the young
[10:17] people and the children.
[10:19] uh everyone like we spoke about you know
[10:22] when you are converted you come into
[10:23] purpose and so on everyone comes to
[10:26] church but not everyone can have a
[10:28] position in the church if everyone has a
[10:30] position there's nobody to serve so it's
[10:33] it's like when we're talking about
[10:35] purpose in the church it's it's like
[10:36] brother Al what can everyone do everyone
[10:39] have to have some kind of position to
[10:41] take uh what do the sisters do you know
[10:44] what do the youth do what is there for
[10:46] the youth some of them can handle this
[10:48] and than that, you know, the the
[10:49] technology, the sound, and and the rest
[10:52] of them are don't have anything to do.
[10:54] It looks like there's not enough
[10:56] positions in a church. Even if you have
[10:58] a,000 people, 6,000 people, you cannot
[11:02] have all 6,000 people having a position
[11:04] in the church.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; It just it just doesn't uh make sense.
[11:09] There there's got to be people who we
[11:12] are serving,
[11:14] right? So the questions are like what
[11:17] are there for the parents of young
[11:19] children to do? You have young children
[11:21] you know it's like you're preaching
[11:23] brother Allan we need purpose we need to
[11:25] do things we need to be active but right
[11:28] now we've got children to take care of
[11:29] we've got young children you know what
[11:32] can we do in the church where we can now
[11:35] neglect those children now to go and
[11:36] fulfill some duties. What is there for
[11:39] the old people to do? We've we've been
[11:41] through church for four decades and
[11:43] we've we've done so much for the gospel
[11:45] and now we're we're we're older. What
[11:48] are we supposed to be doing?
[11:50] And we all agree that it's true that we
[11:53] we can identify our experience by when
[11:57] we were begotten of the Lord, when we
[11:59] were born again. But conversion remains
[12:03] a bit vague
[12:05] and not completely comprehendable.
[12:09] Like we don't really understand, we
[12:11] can't comprehend exactly from what we
[12:13] spoken about in conversion. We
[12:15] understand what begotten means when the
[12:17] Lord was seeking us and the gene seed
[12:20] was planted and we went through life and
[12:21] then we the born again experience we can
[12:24] understand that. But being converted
[12:27] uh what does that mean? Right? So we
[12:30] discussed um many things and uh spoke
[12:33] for a while and then we had a we went
[12:37] home. We had a conversation with our
[12:38] sons as well. I think we spoke till like
[12:41] midnight last Sunday just discussing the
[12:43] service and we discussed many things but
[12:46] one of the things we looked at and this
[12:47] is what I want to take as a kind of
[12:49] introduction to this. One of the things
[12:51] we looked at was predestination
[12:54] and we were discussing why so many
[12:56] people struggle with the concept of
[12:59] predestination.
[13:01] And the reason people resist the concept
[13:03] of predestination is because it has been
[13:06] portrayed incorrectly to people.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; Right? And people have um people in the
[13:12] message have developed this idea of
[13:16] predestination as if it is like
[13:18] eliteness,
[13:20] you know, like we have been chosen
[13:23] and um we have been chosen above others
[13:26] because we are special
[13:29] or because God chose us above others to
[13:32] make it to heaven.
[13:34] So when you have that, you give that
[13:36] impression to other people, to
[13:40] outsiders, to unbelievers, to your
[13:43] family members, and you you give them
[13:45] this impression. Well, I am elite. I am
[13:48] chosen. God chose me. God chose me to do
[13:52] what? To be what? And the usual thought
[13:55] with me people is that God has chosen us
[13:58] above to save us so that we might go to
[14:01] heaven. That is really juvenile.
[14:05] There's no other way to say that. I, you
[14:08] know, I told my sons, if people truly
[14:10] understood the predestination
[14:12] and you're in your right minds, you'd
[14:15] never want it.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; You'd never ask for it if you only know
[14:21] what it entails.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; And the the example I gave them was
[14:26] Christ was predestinated to suffer
[14:29] Calvary and die.
[14:31] He was chosen.
[14:34] That body was chosen for that purpose,
[14:37] right? And we'll have a look at that. Uh
[14:40] all other sons of God through the Bible.
[14:42] The word predestination does not even
[14:45] occur in the Bible. Only the word
[14:48] predestinate and predestinated.
[14:52] But when you look at the words, if
[14:54] people would study it closely, you'd
[14:56] actually find the Bible is so specific.
[15:00] It said you are predestinated unto
[15:03] something
[15:05] or you to predestinate you to something.
[15:09] It never says you are predestinated to
[15:11] be saved to go to heaven.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Not one place.
[15:17] If anything once again people confused
[15:20] the words of the prophet because they
[15:23] don't take the time to understand the
[15:25] context of what the prophet is saying.
[15:27] Like for example, in some places he says
[15:29] you are predestinated unto eternal life.
[15:32] When you look at that, you think
[15:34] predestinated unto? Oh, okay. So, I've
[15:36] been chosen to go to heaven. I've been
[15:38] chosen by God to live forever. Glory to
[15:40] God. Hallelujah.
[15:43] Eternal life has a responsibility.
[15:48] Eternal life has a purpose,
[15:52] right?
[15:53] Nowhere does it say you are
[15:54] predestinated to go to heaven or
[15:56] predestinated to go to hell.
[16:00] As if in other you know what you're
[16:02] saying when you say predestinated
[16:05] it basically means you have no choice.
[16:07] Yeah,
[16:08] &gt;&gt; it means God chose you. And whether you
[16:11] try, think of this, if this is God, that
[16:14] if a human tries so hard to live
[16:17] righteously, to be good, to do the right
[16:21] thing because God didn't choose him,
[16:24] he's going to hell
[16:26] and he's eternally lost.
[16:29] Think of that if that is God's nature,
[16:34] right? In likewise, when you say I'm
[16:37] predestinated to go to heaven, the
[16:39] Calvinistic approach is no matter what I
[16:41] do, no matter how I live, no how no
[16:44] matter how irresponsible I am, no matter
[16:46] how much I sin, no matter how much I
[16:48] think terrible things and cheat and
[16:51] fraud and steal and be immoral because
[16:54] God chose me, I'm his child. I'll be in
[16:57] heaven.
[17:00] That's the problem. So when when people
[17:02] hear you say those things, they think
[17:04] you're mad
[17:08] &gt;&gt; and they might be right
[17:10] if you say it that way. The prophet then
[17:14] says we must find the balance with
[17:16] predestination.
[17:18] He said in marriage and divorce there
[17:19] are two schools of thought and they both
[17:21] run out on a limb like the like the tree
[17:25] trunk is here and the branches go out
[17:27] and as the branch go out it goes from
[17:30] thick to thin. So if you run out on a
[17:33] limb and you keep running you reach the
[17:34] end of the branch and then you fall off
[17:37] or it gets so thin it breaks.
[17:39] &gt;&gt; He says that's what that's what he means
[17:41] by you're running out on a limb.
[17:44] So he says there were uh I spoke of it
[17:46] more specifically Paul also mentions it
[17:49] in Romans and Ephesians. So I want to
[17:51] read from the first quote from serpent
[17:53] seed
[17:55] um page 10 paragraph one. He said now
[17:58] how did it ever start?
[18:00] We'll have to hurry and get it get to it
[18:02] just as quickly as possible. How it ever
[18:05] started? Now we got plenty of scriptures
[18:07] wrote out here about the Holy Ghost. And
[18:09] another thing we made a challenge last
[18:10] night on the pier perseverance of the
[18:12] saints. Not in the way the Baptist
[18:14] believe it. No, sir. All right, here it
[18:16] is. I sure differ or I differ with the
[18:20] Baptists and their idea of their theory
[18:22] of Calvinism. I certainly disagree with
[18:26] the Presbyterian.
[18:28] I disagree with the Methodist upon their
[18:30] way of Armenian. In other words, the two
[18:33] ways of predestination, I disagree with
[18:35] both sides. In other words, like what I
[18:38] mentioned, I'm saved. I'm chosen. I'm on
[18:41] my way to heaven. I can live however I
[18:42] want to. The other side, I can try as
[18:44] hard as I can. I'm never going to make
[18:46] it. Right? Uh an Armenian side is you
[18:50] have to work hard to make it. It's all
[18:54] got to do with your works. So one side
[18:56] is Calvinism. I don't have to work. The
[18:58] other side is I have to do all the works
[19:00] and if I don't make it sufficiently, I
[19:02] won't make it. Brother said, I don't
[19:05] agree with both sides. Yes, sir. But
[19:07] they they both got a truth. Yes. Amen.
[19:11] &gt;&gt; But you got to bring it back here where
[19:14] it is true.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; When you run out there, you run wild
[19:19] with it. Certainly. So predestination
[19:22] is exactly what it sounds like.
[19:25] Predestination
[19:27] [Music]
[19:29] means your destination is predetermined.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; Right? Destination is predetermined
[19:38] or there is a predetermined outcome. The
[19:42] problem is making the destination
[19:44] heaven.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:49] &gt;&gt; Nobody said that.
[19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:51] &gt;&gt; Not even the Bible.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; The destination in the Bible is adoption
[19:56] of sons.
[19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:58] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; See, so there has to be a destination.
[20:03] There has to be an outcome.
[20:05] The outcome is predetermined,
[20:08] not the path.
[20:12] It means you have been chosen by God to
[20:15] achieve something for him. God has
[20:19] predetermined it that you will do it.
[20:23] How you do it, how long it takes depends
[20:26] on your choices.
[20:28] But he is going to make sure by whatever
[20:31] means to help you get there. He's going
[20:35] to assist you to get there. That's what
[20:38] predestination actually is. A lot of it
[20:42] doesn't immediately make sense, but
[20:44] we'll show it to you. Let's go to Romans
[20:46] 8 29-30
[20:49] firstly, and then after we done with
[20:51] this, then we'll see how many of you are
[20:53] whooping and screaming to be
[20:54] predestinated.
[20:58] For whom he did forno, he also did
[21:01] predestinate to be conformed to the
[21:04] image of his son. If I was a nice
[21:07] evangelist, I'd be saying glory to God.
[21:11] Predestinated to the image of his son,
[21:14] glorious image
[21:17] that he might be the firstborn among
[21:19] many brethren. Nobody's thinking past
[21:22] and deeper into this. Verse 30.
[21:25] Moreover, whom he did predestinate,
[21:29] them he also called.
[21:32] And whom he called, them he also
[21:33] justified. And whom he justified, them
[21:35] he also glorified.
[21:37] What is the destination?
[21:40] What is the outcome? What is the
[21:42] predetermined outcome?
[21:45] The predetermined outcome in this
[21:47] scripture is that you are conformed to
[21:49] the image of Christ. What's the next
[21:52] question? What is the image of Christ?
[21:55] If the outcome is the image of Christ
[21:58] and I am predestinated to the image of
[22:00] Christ, I am predestinated to get to the
[22:03] image of Christ.
[22:04] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[22:05] &gt;&gt; there's a path to that. That's the
[22:08] outcome. My outcome has been
[22:10] predetermined by God by his fornowledge.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:15] &gt;&gt; But what is the image of Christ? What
[22:18] does that mean? It looks so glorious
[22:20] when you heard and the evangelists will
[22:21] go, he wants us to be like him. Glory.
[22:24] Hallelujah. He wants you to be perfect,
[22:27] kind, gentle, loving, heavenly, and
[22:31] living forever. Somebody say, "Amen."
[22:33] Let's have church in here right now.
[22:37] No. The image of Christ
[22:40] is to experience his experience.
[22:44] That he might be the firstborn among
[22:45] many brethren. That he will be the
[22:47] firstborn, the beginner of many who will
[22:50] be like him.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[22:53] And what is that?
[22:55] The image of Isan is to be selfless,
[23:00] to live for the salvation of others, to
[23:03] suffer persecution,
[23:05] to suffer turmoil, to give up things
[23:08] that you would like for the sake of
[23:11] others
[23:12] and suffer the turmoil and possibly
[23:15] death and destruction for the purpose of
[23:18] God. Now, how many want it?
[23:24] All the saints of the ages were chosen
[23:27] and they fulfilled this. They bore their
[23:30] cross.
[23:33] To be conformed to the image of Christ
[23:35] means to have a cross of your own to
[23:38] carry someday
[23:41] or through your life.
[23:44] You are predestinated to that. How many
[23:46] glory hallelujah will you hear being
[23:49] shouted and screamed when that is the
[23:52] reality you are confronted with
[23:55] now you won't go around the world
[23:56] bragging I'm predestinated I'm chosen
[23:59] I'm elect
[24:03] if you only knew what it is in your
[24:05] right mind you wouldn't want it because
[24:07] it's logical not to want this
[24:12] all the saints of the ages did he told
[24:15] told them it would be their purpose.
[24:17] Didn't Christ tell them? He said, "I
[24:20] came to put a sword among you. Because
[24:23] of me, your family will be divided.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; There will be a sword between father and
[24:28] son, between mother and daughter."
[24:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because of my sake, you will
[24:33] be tried. You will be scourged. You will
[24:36] be given to death. You will be you will
[24:39] be given to tribulation by the leaders
[24:41] around you. Be for my sake. you will
[24:44] suffer persecution. He had told them.
[24:50] He didn't say, "Don't worry. Let's go
[24:51] sing it. It's a highway to heaven.
[24:56] None shall walk up there but the pure in
[24:58] heart." Oh, we love that song, but we
[25:01] know what it means when we sing it,
[25:06] &gt;&gt; right? Verse 30 links predestination to
[25:10] calling.
[25:12] Do you know what calling means in the
[25:14] Bible? Calling means to be named.
[25:18] What is to be named? Ephesians 4:1 says
[25:22] is uh uh links calling to vocation.
[25:27] What is vocation?
[25:28] Right? To be named means to be given a
[25:32] particular vocation.
[25:35] To be named means to be given a
[25:37] particular purpose. Yeah.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; So just being given some random gift of
[25:43] the Holy Ghost is not what this is.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Just cuz when you came when you were
[25:47] born again and you receive the gift of
[25:49] the Holy Ghost, maybe it was speaking
[25:50] with tongues. That's not your name.
[25:53] &gt;&gt; That's not what you were called to do.
[25:57] What is your name? Right? Just being
[26:00] given random positions in the church or
[26:03] positions in uh the message kingdom if
[26:07] you want to call it. I don't know.
[26:10] Named
[26:12] called has got to do with purpose and
[26:14] vocation. Let's go to Ephesians 1:5.
[26:18] This this these are the the only
[26:20] scriptures, four scriptures, four places
[26:23] that predestinated or predestinate is
[26:26] mentioned. Ephesians 15. And he can only
[26:29] say this to the Ephesian church. having
[26:31] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[26:34] children by Jesus Christ to himself.
[26:38] That's already telling you you are not a
[26:41] child of God. This person you are born
[26:45] of flesh and blood, but you were
[26:47] adopted.
[26:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:51] &gt;&gt; By the new birth
[26:53] &gt;&gt; to be the word made flesh
[26:57] for your day. For what reason?
[27:00] No random reason like God looked down
[27:02] and said, "Oh, I like this guy cuz he
[27:04] likes me.
[27:06] Let's take him."
[27:09] Adoption of children. What is adoption
[27:12] about?
[27:13] A son coming to maturity to take over
[27:16] the father's business.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; That's what your outcome is.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; Why are we thinking your outcome is
[27:25] heaven?
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Are we going to do it heaven?
[27:31] Just to come back here.
[27:34] Heaven is only like where we fuel up.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Just to come back here.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; To fulfill the outcome that we were
[27:42] chosen for.
[27:46] This tells you you are predestinated.
[27:50] Your destination that was predetermined
[27:53] is the adoption of children.
[27:57] So when Christ stood on Mount
[27:59] Transfiguration in Matthew 17 and the
[28:02] adoption of Christ was recognized and
[28:06] the adoption is a son being recognized
[28:09] by the father and made a spectacle of to
[28:12] the public to say this is the one whom
[28:14] I've chosen. Like when Peter and James
[28:17] and John, they're standing there and
[28:18] saying, "Let's build a tabernacle to
[28:20] Moses and Elijah." And he says the word
[28:22] of God came and said, "Not them. This is
[28:25] my beloved son. Amen.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. He is glorified. Only one
[28:30] altar." That's making a spectacle. What
[28:32] was a spectacle for? He is the one
[28:34] chosen. And what was he chosen for? To
[28:37] suffer and die for the salvation of
[28:41] mankind.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:46] But first before you come to the
[28:48] adoption of children,
[28:51] what is the adoption of children?
[28:53] Children must not remain children. You
[28:56] must come up to the adoption which is
[28:58] maturity of children.
[29:01] Right? So you are predetermined.
[29:04] You are predestinated.
[29:06] The process of adoption is bringing you
[29:08] to maturity. If you were not chosen, you
[29:12] would never be mature.
[29:15] You would still be that grubbling loser
[29:17] &gt;&gt; who couldn't handle his life or her life
[29:20] out there in the world who would end up
[29:22] just like everyone else in this world
[29:24] waiting for the end of the day to get
[29:26] into some kind of of a drug or
[29:29] entertainment to take away your misery.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[29:34] Yet you have been chosen
[29:37] by God to come to the maturity of sons
[29:41] of God for a particular purpose.
[29:45] And then this process of adoption is not
[29:49] a path of ease and soft living.
[29:54] Right? Nobody promised it's going to be
[29:56] an easy ride.
[29:58] uh you know if it were an easy life it
[30:01] wouldn't say according to the good
[30:04] pleasure of his will.
[30:06] People read that and think oh yes God's
[30:09] pleasure you know when you read that you
[30:11] don't see the discomfort in there's a
[30:14] lot of discomfort in there. The fact
[30:16] that he told you what you are about to
[30:18] go through is for the good pleasure of
[30:20] his will should frighten you.
[30:24] This is telling you that things are not
[30:25] going to go the way you like it
[30:29] &gt;&gt; and you have been chosen for that.
[30:34] &gt;&gt; You know, um I'm going to go through
[30:36] that in a little while and then we're
[30:38] going to have this
[30:40] uh you know this this this realization.
[30:43] Let's go to Ephesians 1:11.
[30:46] in whom also we have obtained an
[30:49] inheritance
[30:50] being predestinated according to the
[30:53] purpose of him. So there's the last
[30:56] place predestinated is used and once
[30:58] again it's telling you you are
[31:00] predestinated according to the purpose.
[31:04] Predestination is linked to purpose.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; It's linked to calling. It's linked to
[31:09] vocation. It's linked. You're not
[31:12] predestinated to heaven or the outcome
[31:15] of your of of your life. You becoming an
[31:17] angel someday and being so happy and I I
[31:21] can't even imagine. I can't even
[31:23] describe that because to me that is so
[31:24] not real.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Right. Listen, heaven was a place where
[31:32] the angels
[31:34] had free will and a whole bunch of them
[31:36] were deceived.
[31:39] So what's your idea of heaven?
[31:43] &gt;&gt; See this
[31:45] this Greek mythology and Roman mythology
[31:47] of there in the clouds and stars and the
[31:49] skies and you know all of us standing
[31:51] there and singing.
[31:53] &gt;&gt; I don't understand this this idea of
[31:56] heaven and harps playing and you know
[31:58] people all singing and worshiping like
[32:01] uh like they are all have this this
[32:04] group delusion.
[32:06] They've been drugged
[32:08] by God to just say nice things and
[32:11] worship and bow down. And can you
[32:13] imagine if if if it even was a three and
[32:16] a half year wedding feast and all we
[32:19] were doing was just standing and bowing
[32:22] down every single moment singing songs.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Do you really think that's heaven?
[32:32] Th this is the point for the life of me.
[32:35] people who have received the open book
[32:37] and the message of the hour from this
[32:39] prophet to go back to the delusions of
[32:42] denominational people.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; To think to have those imaginations of
[32:47] heaven is beyond me. I don't understand
[32:50] how you got to that as a reality of what
[32:52] heaven is. Even hell, hell to them is
[32:55] this, you know, dark place with like
[32:58] fire burning everywhere. People running
[33:00] and screaming and and devils chasing
[33:02] them, laughing.
[33:05] you know, with a fork and poking them
[33:07] and moving them into caves of fire and
[33:11] really
[33:14] I don't understand how when you have a
[33:16] reality, you can't understand the truth.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; So why would I say it's not something
[33:22] you would desire?
[33:24] Some of you, you know, extremely
[33:27] overrighteous people, you know, of
[33:30] course, brother, I I will lay down my
[33:31] life for Christ. I will I will do
[33:33] anything, you know. I will do everything
[33:35] for him. He's called me. I will
[33:39] I know you're lying
[33:42] because I've got hundreds of witnesses
[33:45] who are proof in the Bible,
[33:47] right? Just look at all the characters
[33:49] of the Bible and you identify their
[33:52] begotten, born, and converted stages.
[33:55] Let's start with number one, which is
[33:56] Noah.
[33:59] Noah is living in a day where there's uh
[34:02] no church, no Bible, no books, whatever.
[34:06] Noah, all he wants in life is to have
[34:09] his wife and children and take care of
[34:11] his farming and feed his family. There's
[34:14] no religion for him to follow. What does
[34:16] he care what the world is doing? Let
[34:18] them destroy themselves. Well, I'm
[34:20] living my life according to God. That's
[34:23] like some of you are thinking right now
[34:25] today.
[34:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't need to be involved with
[34:27] other people's. Listen, if they want to
[34:29] live that, let them go and kill
[34:30] themselves. What do I care? Why must I
[34:34] be the one chosen to save mankind? You
[34:37] know, I mean, they they choosing that
[34:40] life. They want to do that. They want to
[34:42] drink. They want to smoke. They want to
[34:44] curse. They want to dress like that.
[34:45] They want to live that way. Let them do
[34:47] it. That's you.
[34:53] It's in their heart. And God says, "No,
[34:55] I want to save mankind.
[34:57] And I've chosen you. And for the next
[35:00] 120 years, you will build me an ark.
[35:04] You with your three sons, no one else is
[35:08] going to help you. You will pull the
[35:10] logs. You will chop them down. You will
[35:13] drag them. You will nail them in. You
[35:15] will find the pit. For 120 years,
[35:23] you will do this. I have chosen you.
[35:26] Tell me. He woke up every day, had his
[35:28] coffee, and said, "Let's get to work,
[35:30] boys. This is going to be fantastic for
[35:34] the glory of God and the salvation of
[35:36] mankind. We're all so happy. Let's have
[35:39] family alter." And thank God for this
[35:41] choosing.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[35:47] Yet you tell it as Bible stories and
[35:49] Sunday school stories.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; How about Abraham living in the Chaldes
[35:57] peacefully married his wife Sarai? Abram
[36:01] married Sarai living in one of the
[36:03] richest spots on earth. richest spots of
[36:06] the Chaldises of Mesopotamia, the the
[36:09] hub of uh of of life in in that part of
[36:14] the world, the first place of
[36:16] civilization, the place where there was
[36:18] writing and cities and fashion and and
[36:21] uh um um building of of of things that I
[36:25] mean this would have been the Hollywood
[36:26] of the world. And God tells him, "I have
[36:30] chosen you. Leave your family. Leave
[36:33] your father's house. Leave everyone
[36:35] behind. Take take Sarah, your wife, and
[36:39] go to a place you've never been before
[36:41] where it's riddled with venerial
[36:43] disease. Total idiots, people who don't
[36:47] know God. Go there, and I will make of
[36:49] you a great nation. Knowing that both
[36:52] you and your wife are barren
[36:56] &gt;&gt; that I have chosen you for this.
[37:00] No signs, no pillar of fire, no
[37:03] scriptures, no prophets. He heard a
[37:05] voice.
[37:10] So what? Abraham packs up his house,
[37:12] leaves his business. How many of you
[37:14] will do that?
[37:17] leaves his business, uh, starts moving
[37:20] to another city. He's got no GPS.
[37:25] He's got no cars. He's got no trucks,
[37:28] camels locked and loaded. And then he's
[37:31] moving. And his dad comes, "Where do you
[37:33] think you're going?
[37:35] You are my oldest son. You are my heir.
[37:38] You are the heir of my inheritance.
[37:40] Where do you think you're going, Dad? I
[37:42] got to do this. God called me.
[37:45] God called you? Which God?
[37:48] You know, was it that gold one, that
[37:50] silver one? The wooden one, the stone
[37:51] one, which one was it? Tell me, I'll
[37:53] break him.
[37:58] I heard a voice. Tell me for the next
[38:02] hundred years or if he lived however
[38:05] long Abraham lived that he was thinking
[38:09] in his mind, this is the most glorious
[38:11] life I could have chosen for myself.
[38:16] And then of course his nephew Lot comes
[38:18] along with him who is a total pain in
[38:20] the neck.
[38:22] Never is grateful for anything. Always
[38:25] wants more. Always wants to piggy back
[38:27] of Abram's blessing. And it's just, you
[38:30] know, you get some of the relatives that
[38:31] are always there. You can't get rid of
[38:33] them. They just got a piggyback of your
[38:36] blessing. That's all. All they want is
[38:38] want, want, want, want, and they give
[38:40] nothing.
[38:41] Yeah. That's who Lot wants. got the
[38:43] right name too.
[38:47] H
[38:48] take a lot and give nothing.
[38:51] Eventually, Abram even has to try and
[38:53] save him. The guy goes to Sodom and
[38:55] Gomorrah
[38:58] and Abram has to save him, but Abram is
[39:00] chosen. Amen.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; How about Jacob?
[39:06] This guy probably wish he never got that
[39:08] birthright.
[39:10] Hey, he fought for something inside him.
[39:12] That was that begotten stage.
[39:15] Hey, makes him cheat his brother out of
[39:18] the birthright. Goes and gets the
[39:20] blessing. His mother was was was telling
[39:22] him this is the right thing to do and
[39:24] preaching to him and whatever. And he
[39:27] did it and then is running for his life
[39:29] the rest of his life. And then as to
[39:31] come back to take his position, God
[39:34] chose him to bring the 12 tribes of
[39:37] Israel
[39:38] &gt;&gt; who would save the world by the
[39:40] Levitical order.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Did that man at that time ever know his
[39:46] great purpose?
[39:50] &gt;&gt; The guy gets tricked out. He wants to
[39:52] marry this woman. He falls in love with
[39:54] Rachel. He gets tricked because at that
[39:57] time the the wife is given to you with a
[39:59] veil over it. You go and take her into
[40:01] the tent. Then you lift the veil
[40:05] and then for the glory of God, he still
[40:08] has to bear with this and then work
[40:09] another seven years for a wife that he
[40:12] actually was in love with.
[40:16] And then bring forth the Joseph,
[40:19] the next son who is chosen. This one
[40:22] glorious life, seven color cloak.
[40:24] Gloria, glory, hallelujah. Gets thrown
[40:27] in the pit for three days.
[40:29] &gt;&gt; Gets sold as a slave to Egypt.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; Gets taken by Pifa. Gets thrown in
[40:34] prison. This is the predestinated life.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; Only to come out to save the world from
[40:42] famine cuz God foresaw it.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; How about Moses? Hey, this this this
[40:52] fella gets to live in a palace.
[40:57] Perfect life. Why would he want to leave
[41:00] there? Go to a desert, live like a
[41:03] bedin.
[41:04] How many of you would do that?
[41:07] How many of you would give up your
[41:08] wonderful life in your plush suburb
[41:10] where you live to go and live in a
[41:13] desert like a bedin for the sake of God?
[41:17] You all shout it. You all sing about it.
[41:19] You all sing specials at conventions and
[41:22] combines and everything, but ask you one
[41:24] day to give up one thing
[41:27] &gt;&gt; for the glory of God.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Then brag to me about your
[41:33] predestination.
[41:36] Amen.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; How about Ruth? H Ruth, this woman was a
[41:41] Moabitis. She was
[41:44] uh rejected or persecuted by the
[41:48] Hebrews.
[41:49] She then is married to a Hebrew who was
[41:52] backsliden of all things. Then he dies.
[41:56] Then by the law, she has to follow the
[41:57] mother-in-law. Goes back to that. And
[41:59] then she has to go and uh do something
[42:03] that's going to put her life in danger.
[42:04] go and sleep on the threshing floor at
[42:06] the feet of Boaz in the hope
[42:11] that she will do the right thing for the
[42:13] lever law to be enacted again so that
[42:16] the inheritance would come back to
[42:17] Naomi. She has to go and do that for
[42:19] Naomi not knowing her purposes to bring
[42:22] forth
[42:23] &gt;&gt; David. Amen.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Bring forth the lineage of David. All
[42:29] she had to go through. This was her
[42:31] predestination.
[42:33] This was her outcome that God had
[42:35] predetermined when it started. Did she
[42:37] have any clue?
[42:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[42:41] &gt;&gt; What did God know? What did God see by
[42:43] foreign knowledge? That this girl's
[42:45] heart would say,
[42:48] "Where you go, I will go. Where you
[42:50] lodge, I will lodge.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Your God shall be my God. Your people
[42:54] shall be my people." God by fornowledge
[42:57] saw her character and predestinated her
[43:00] outcome.
[43:02] The outcome was glorious. The path was
[43:05] difficult.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; How about Rahab? She was a harlot. She
[43:11] was known to be a harlot. She would have
[43:12] been unworthy. Every single person would
[43:15] have spoken against her. The king sent
[43:18] his men to see that this is where these
[43:20] spies would have been hiding. But this
[43:22] woman is chosen of God again to be part
[43:25] of the lineage of David.
[43:29] Lastly, David.
[43:31] David is a shepherd.
[43:34] Um,
[43:36] taking care of sheep. Smell like them.
[43:39] Last born of the family. The runt.
[43:43] Is that right?
[43:45] Even his brothers scoffed, laughed when
[43:49] Samuel chose him. His own father said,
[43:53] "The prophet, I think you made a
[43:55] mistake.
[43:58] It can't be him. Surely look at my other
[44:00] sons. They're more impressive. They're
[44:02] in the army.
[44:04] You must have made a mistake. No, not a
[44:08] mistake. He's the one chosen from the
[44:10] time he was anointed with oil.
[44:14] Anointed with oil, right? Are you seeing
[44:16] begotten born?
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; He knew what he's being anointed for.
[44:20] He's being anointed by the prophet to be
[44:22] the king of Israel. Right? Every day
[44:25] your regular message person will come
[44:27] on. I have been anointed. Hallelujah.
[44:30] Holy Ghost oil poured on me. Glory to
[44:32] God. I'm living in my purpose. He's
[44:35] running for his life.
[44:38] For the majority part of David's life,
[44:40] he's running. Everything he does is not
[44:42] pleasing this king. Everything he does
[44:45] is turning into disaster.
[44:48] And then he becomes king. God
[44:51] establishes his his kingdom. And the
[44:54] first thing that happens when he gets on
[44:55] his throne is commits adultery and
[44:57] murder.
[45:00] What is his purpose? To produce Solomon.
[45:03] Solomon will build the temple. Solomon
[45:05] will restore the the worship back to
[45:07] Israel. Bring peace.
[45:11] The same man with all the troubles. Look
[45:13] at the troubles he went through. His
[45:15] family got torn apart. He lost some of
[45:17] his sons. Most of his sons. Some of them
[45:21] backslid. Some of them were unrighteous.
[45:22] Some of them kill the other one.
[45:27] How about that for a predestinated son
[45:30] of God?
[45:32] H flashy lifestyle.
[45:36] No.
[45:37] So notice how each one is made aware of
[45:40] the presence of God, the turmoil they go
[45:42] through, and the effort to resist. Can
[45:44] you see how many times you look at all
[45:46] these people? This I just chose eight.
[45:50] Look at how many times they doubted they
[45:53] were actually would have chosen a
[45:55] different way. Even Abraham listened to
[45:59] Sarah and thought, "Yeah, well maybe uh
[46:02] Hagga might be the right way. He made a
[46:05] mistake and God went along with that
[46:08] mistake and had to bless that fellow
[46:10] too."
[46:15] Notice the turmoil receiving a call. God
[46:19] knew you would accept the call. You had
[46:21] no You had no idea why you accepted the
[46:24] call, but you accept it.
[46:27] Look at how it clashes with your own
[46:29] will.
[46:31] Then you try to insert your will into
[46:33] his. Do we see it there?
[46:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. And look at the trouble we get into
[46:38] because of trying to insert our own will
[46:40] into God's purpose. Yeah.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; Then you can see how many of them went
[46:45] through backslidiveness when they had uh
[46:48] felt they had no more purpose. Look at
[46:51] Noah. Noah comes out on the end of the
[46:53] flood. His purpose is over. 120 years.
[46:56] Builds the ark. Uh goes through that
[46:59] flood. Awful time. Does everything God
[47:02] tells him. Comes out on the other side
[47:04] and becomes a drunken.
[47:08] This is important because this is kind
[47:10] of what happens when you feel your
[47:11] purpose has ended
[47:14] and when things grow cold and you're not
[47:16] sure what your life is supposed to be in
[47:18] the message. This is what happens. You
[47:20] go into backslideness.
[47:23] All right. And then there is another
[47:26] kind of predestination. It's a bad
[47:28] predestination. Do you know that? Yeah.
[47:31] These are those who are predestinated to
[47:33] destruction like Esau, Pharaoh, and
[47:36] Judas.
[47:37] They are predestinated. In other words,
[47:39] their outcome has been predetermined by
[47:41] God.
[47:42] What does it mean God made them evil?
[47:45] No. God knew they were evil and knew he
[47:47] could use them.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; They were born evil.
[47:52] These people are chosen by God,
[47:55] predestinated to bring about a certain
[47:57] result. Their destination is
[48:00] predetermined to be destruction.
[48:03] Anyone hearing that thinks this is so
[48:04] unfair? Why would God do that to a
[48:06] person? The the difference is these
[48:09] people enjoyed their lives as compared
[48:12] to those other eight we showed you and
[48:13] the many others. Pharaoh, Esau, Judas,
[48:17] they enjoyed their lives. They were
[48:19] enjoying their evil ways.
[48:23] You know that. And it led to
[48:25] destruction. They were a lot of these
[48:27] people in the times of the believers.
[48:30] These people that were predestinated to
[48:33] destruction. They were powerful. They
[48:36] were rich. They were admired by people
[48:38] and they gathered political attention
[48:41] and admiration. There are no emotions
[48:44] involved with God. This is not about
[48:47] emotions. It's not about oh he deserves
[48:50] that. He's so kind. He should be He
[48:55] should be my son, you know. And that
[48:58] fellow,
[48:59] he doesn't even deserve me looking at
[49:01] him. There's no emotions with God's
[49:03] choosing. It's all about God's purpose,
[49:07] &gt;&gt; right? Nobody deserves anything.
[49:11] Saints, all have sinned and fallen short
[49:14] of the glory of God.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Nobody deserves anything. That's why
[49:18] there's a thing called grace. Because
[49:20] nobody deserves it.
[49:23] It has to do with God knowing it's
[49:25] simply this people. We might as well all
[49:28] say we're all bad people.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; But there's something about our choices
[49:34] that God knew we would make.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; And those choices could be used for his
[49:39] purpose.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let me break it down for you.
[49:43] God knew there would be a Pharaoh born
[49:46] in a certain time who would be an
[49:48] absolute psychopath and a narcissist. He
[49:52] also knew that the Amorites would come
[49:54] to their fullness shortly after a time.
[49:58] After that time, he knew there was going
[50:00] to be a massive famine at a certain time
[50:03] before that. He knew the world would
[50:05] need salvation from the famine and from
[50:09] the Amorites. So he predetermined
[50:13] a process of salvation
[50:16] &gt;&gt; which was going to need predestinated
[50:19] sons.
[50:21] famine Amorites
[50:23] somewhere in between there's a pharaoh
[50:26] he realized I can use this pharaoh that
[50:28] would be the perfect time I could do
[50:30] this I can do so here's what happens he
[50:34] sees that he calls Abraham and starts
[50:36] off a chain of events Abraham and Sarai
[50:39] were in the right time and had the right
[50:41] natures he calls Abram and Sarai and
[50:44] gives them a promise the one promise
[50:46] they know they would die for and that is
[50:50] a child cuz both of them are barren.
[50:54] He knows they would make the right
[50:55] choice. He calls Abram and Sarah, gives
[50:57] them the promise. He knew they'd have
[50:59] Isaac after 25 years. So that after 25
[51:04] years, I mean, he could have given Isaac
[51:05] after 10 years. Why 25? Because Rebecca
[51:08] had to be in position.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; He saw that by fornowledge.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Isaac would have to marry Rebecca to
[51:14] bring forth the Jacob.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; He could see that.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. By forn knowledge he predestinates.
[51:21] He knew the absence of Abraham's seed
[51:23] when Abraham seed is taken away from
[51:25] Canaan and they go to stay in Gan. He
[51:29] knew the absence of Abraham's seed was
[51:30] going to cause the rising of the
[51:31] Amorites and the Amorites were going to
[51:34] fill Canaan with lasciviousness
[51:36] uh all kinds of concupisence. And then
[51:40] um he he's going to take them he takes
[51:43] them over. They're gone to go and when
[51:45] the Amorites rise, they're going to
[51:47] they're going to pollute the land and
[51:48] he's going to have to bring them back to
[51:51] put things right. Okay. So, he knew this
[51:55] absence and uh uh it would reach
[51:58] exponential proportions. And Joseph's
[52:00] people were living comfortable and happy
[52:03] in Goan, not desiring to leave, even
[52:06] having forgotten that they had an
[52:08] inheritance given to their grandfather
[52:10] Abraham.
[52:13] Living in Goan, enjoying the comforts
[52:15] under the Pharaoh. Then he knew this was
[52:18] going to happen. Here comes this son of
[52:21] the other Pharaoh who's a total
[52:23] psychopath who decides, well, we've got
[52:26] all these people, talented people. let's
[52:27] build an empire for Egypt.
[52:30] They had no idea what God's purpose was.
[52:33] That God wanted to cleanse the land of
[52:34] the Amorites. That he kept them in Goan
[52:37] waiting for the Amorites to come to its
[52:39] fullness and when it was time has to
[52:41] bring them into hardship to get them to
[52:43] desire to get out from there.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; God doesn't control by force. He
[52:50] controls by knowing your heart. Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; And what whether your heart is full of
[52:55] faith or doubt and he knows how to allow
[52:59] every individual
[53:01] necessary to make certain choices.
[53:05] Right? Even using the word control
[53:08] desires or
[53:10] needs an explanation, right? God doesn't
[53:14] control you. He controls his purpose.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Right? We often think he controls us.
[53:21] You know what? I got sick because God
[53:24] wanted me to do that. Don't do that.
[53:27] Right? You a lot of people who think
[53:30] that God controls your life, they're
[53:32] like, "God made me get sick. God brought
[53:35] this death in my family. God made me
[53:37] lose this money to teach me this
[53:39] lesson." You should have learned the
[53:40] lesson without losing the money. Or by
[53:43] God is blessing us with good things. Or
[53:46] this lucky streak. Praise the Lord for
[53:48] this lucky streak. I always tell people
[53:51] you get lucky and what do you do with
[53:52] that luck?
[53:55] &gt;&gt; How much of it do you give back to God?
[53:57] You say it's from God. What what what is
[53:59] God giving you this blessing for? To go
[54:01] off and live a rollicking life. How is
[54:03] that a blessing from God? How is it if
[54:05] it's a blessing from God, it makes you
[54:07] go off and live a life unconscious of
[54:09] God?
[54:12] He doesn't do that.
[54:14] You shouldn't expect things like that of
[54:17] God to make you sick, to bring death, to
[54:19] bring bad times, to do this, to do that.
[54:21] And just because, and the majority of
[54:24] those things in your life are a
[54:26] consequence of your bad decisions,
[54:29] if God brings something, it's got to do
[54:31] with a purpose.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Only a purpose. The rest of it is your
[54:36] choices.
[54:38] Don't make everything God's fault and
[54:41] everything else the devil's fault. Yeah,
[54:43] &gt;&gt; it's your choices,
[54:45] right? We know this sickness comes from
[54:48] the devil. God makes you whole. The
[54:51] prophet says, he says those both those
[54:54] things. By the way, the prophet said all
[54:55] sickness comes from the devil. Said God
[54:58] makes you whole. God makes you well. You
[55:00] should know these things. You should ask
[55:02] questions like God you or you shouldn't
[55:05] ask questions like God why did you let
[55:08] me get so sick? Even the devil doesn't
[55:11] make you sick. Sickness comes from the
[55:13] devil. You went and made yourself sick
[55:16] with something from the devil.
[55:20] You got sick as a consequence of your
[55:22] own choices. Nobody asked you to sit
[55:25] next to somebody who was sneezing or
[55:26] some virus.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; Nobody asked you to go shake hands with
[55:31] somebody who had influenza B.
[55:35] Nobody asked you to. You did that. It
[55:37] was your choice. It was your choice to
[55:38] get in that car. It was your choice to
[55:40] sit next to them at work. It was your
[55:42] choice to get in the elevator. You were
[55:44] not being programmed by God. Go to the
[55:47] elevator.
[55:48] I need you to get sick.
[55:53] Salvation only exists because our
[55:56] choices to walk in error get us into
[55:59] trouble.
[56:01] Right? If Adam did not sin, what would
[56:04] be the need of salvation?
[56:08] Salvation was necessary because of our
[56:10] choices.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; So now every day there is a need of
[56:14] salvation of the soul and a need of
[56:16] healing of the mind and the body.
[56:18] Salvation and healing only comes from
[56:21] God. So what is your purpose in the
[56:25] body? If because of our choices there's
[56:27] always weakness, there's always
[56:29] weakness, there's always bad things
[56:30] happening, our choices are causing
[56:32] trouble. What is your purpose for the
[56:35] body?
[56:37] to strengthen the body.
[56:41] Amen. That is the part that brings us to
[56:43] this conversion small thing we're going
[56:46] to speak about today is strengthening
[56:47] your brethren. All right. So, let's go
[56:49] to Luke 22. We're going to be talking
[56:51] about um are you also with me?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord, sir.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, just before this whole issue
[57:01] happened, the Lord Jesus told them one
[57:04] small thing. One of you is going to
[57:07] betray me. That's all.
[57:11] After that, they ensued a fight, an
[57:14] argument, a contention among them about
[57:17] who would be the greatest among them.
[57:20] And it's not about I'm going to be the
[57:22] greatest. I mean had no they were
[57:24] actually deciding among them who would
[57:27] be the traitor because they were all
[57:31] trying to place a value on themselves
[57:33] who was closer to him, who loved him the
[57:36] most, who he spoke to the most, who he
[57:38] spent the most time with. That's what
[57:40] was going on. And what does he do in
[57:43] verse 25? He says to them, if you look
[57:45] at the politics of the world, he says
[57:48] all the people who are over all the
[57:50] others, the lords and the kings of the
[57:53] Gentiles, they rule all the other people
[57:56] and they are the benefactors. That means
[57:58] the rulers are the ones who benefit.
[58:01] Got it? But you shall not be. So he's
[58:07] literally telling you if you are leaders
[58:10] over my people, you will not be the
[58:12] benefactors.
[58:15] He that is greatest among you, he will
[58:17] be the younger. He's literally telling
[58:18] you in the kingdom of God, if you are
[58:20] chosen to be a leader, you will be a
[58:22] servant.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; And then he tells him, he said, he asks
[58:27] this question as if it's such a foolish
[58:28] question. Whether is who is greater, he
[58:31] that siteth at meat or he that serveth?
[58:34] So the person was well definitely the
[58:36] one who's sitting at meat. So he says to
[58:38] them, well, you are sitting at my table
[58:40] and I'm serving you. You're saying
[58:42] you're greater than me? No,
[58:46] &gt;&gt; let's go to the next one.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; So he says, "You are they which have
[58:51] continued with me in my temptations. You
[58:54] are you are going through the troubles
[58:57] that I am going through.
[58:59] You are suffering the persecution with
[59:02] me." Right? And I've appointed you a
[59:04] kingdom as my father has appointed me.
[59:07] In other words, I'm going to give you
[59:08] rulership. I'm going to give you
[59:10] leadership. I'm going to make you
[59:12] leaders of the church.
[59:15] As I have been given that position, I'm
[59:17] giving you this position and that you
[59:19] may eat and drink at my table in my
[59:21] kingdom, sit on thrones, judging the 12
[59:23] tribes of Israel. And then he switches
[59:26] and he speaks to Peter again. The same
[59:28] fellow that he said to feed my sheep. He
[59:31] looks to Peter, Simon, Simon. Now watch
[59:33] this carefully,
[59:35] right?
[59:37] uh he says to him, "Satan has desired to
[59:41] have you that he may sift you as wheat."
[59:46] Right? So saints, we um obviously would
[59:49] mean that there would be someone uh some
[59:52] who would um what he's saying in this
[59:55] whole context of scripture, he's
[59:57] literally saying there will be some
[59:58] greater people and some lesser people.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; So let's let's get that out of our
[1:00:03] system first.
[1:00:04] God Christ is literally saying there are
[1:00:07] going to be some greater people in the
[1:00:10] church and some lesser people in the
[1:00:12] church. What does he mean by that?
[1:00:14] Nobody likes that statement but it's the
[1:00:16] truth. What does he mean? There are some
[1:00:18] people who are going to have leadership
[1:00:21] qualities and others who will not have.
[1:00:24] There are some who would have a certain
[1:00:25] gift and others who would not. There are
[1:00:28] some who would be wealthier and some who
[1:00:30] will be poor. There are some will be
[1:00:32] educated and some will not be. There are
[1:00:35] some who will have more means and others
[1:00:38] who would have less means. He's
[1:00:40] literally telling you this is going to
[1:00:42] be a part of the Christian church
[1:00:46] in the kingdom of God. There are going
[1:00:47] to be people who are greater and some
[1:00:50] lesser. There will be some who will have
[1:00:52] better experiences than others. There
[1:00:55] are some who will be more righteous than
[1:00:58] others. There are some who will have
[1:01:01] greater morals than others. They will
[1:01:03] come from different life uh experiences.
[1:01:06] Some who will have more testimonies than
[1:01:08] others. Some who would have gifts of
[1:01:10] prophecy. Some who would have riches.
[1:01:12] Some would have opportunities, better
[1:01:15] opportunities than others. He's telling
[1:01:17] us this is going to be the reality.
[1:01:21] We are not lesser because God made us
[1:01:24] that way. Do not ever think because
[1:01:27] someone has more money than you that God
[1:01:30] blessed them. This this is a thing I
[1:01:32] hate that rose up in the message. But
[1:01:35] people look at their wealth and what
[1:01:38] they have achieved and say God blessed
[1:01:39] me.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Be careful what you say
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; when you do that.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Because when you do that, you must
[1:01:45] realize you have more responsibility to
[1:01:48] serve.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; This is what's missing.
[1:01:52] Right? I've heard from where I come from
[1:01:57] long time ago people who had accumulated
[1:01:59] wealth and say I've got all this cuz God
[1:02:02] blessed me and where are you today with
[1:02:05] all that blessing
[1:02:10] if people who are the greater people
[1:02:14] with more opportunities with more
[1:02:15] abilities with more testimonies with
[1:02:17] greater experiences if you are the
[1:02:19] greater
[1:02:20] and you have the Holy Ghost You should
[1:02:23] experience the desire to lift your
[1:02:26] brothers who are lesser out of their
[1:02:30] hardships
[1:02:31] because of distress or whatever they're
[1:02:33] going through. You should have that
[1:02:35] feeling in you to do something.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:39] If you say you have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:41] because by one spirit are you baptized
[1:02:43] into one body. You cannot have you
[1:02:46] cannot be somebody with more means than
[1:02:48] other people and watch your brother
[1:02:50] grovel in the dirt
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; and and tell me you have the same Holy
[1:02:54] Spirit.
[1:02:57] You cannot be somebody who has more
[1:02:59] means and turn a blind eye or a deaf ear
[1:03:01] to people in your church who are in
[1:03:03] need.
[1:03:07] It's in the entire context of the verses
[1:03:10] and especially in you see people want
[1:03:13] purpose but they want positions and
[1:03:15] recognition.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; This does not require recognition and
[1:03:20] positions to recognize that you need to
[1:03:23] strengthen your brethren.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; It's in the entire context of the verses
[1:03:30] especially in verse 31. And so I
[1:03:33] strengthening your brethren. The last
[1:03:35] statement of that that scripture says
[1:03:37] strengthening your brethren, right? When
[1:03:40] you are converted. So we're talking
[1:03:41] about the conversion stage. When you are
[1:03:45] converted, strengthen your brethren.
[1:03:46] Okay? Why strengthen your brethren? The
[1:03:50] context is in verse 31 where it says,
[1:03:53] "Satan has desired to have you."
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Do you know what that means? Satan has
[1:03:59] desired to snare to trap you
[1:04:04] to and then it says to sift you as
[1:04:07] wheat. What is sift you as wheat? To
[1:04:10] divide you.
[1:04:13] That is the enemy's purpose is to divide
[1:04:17] you. Right? He wants to divide the
[1:04:21] brotherhood. The context of
[1:04:23] strengthening your brethren is to oppose
[1:04:27] the division that the serpent is
[1:04:29] bringing.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; You have because the enemy wants to
[1:04:33] divide the brotherhood. Your job is to
[1:04:36] strengthen the brotherhood.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Your purpose is to why? Because the
[1:04:41] brotherhood is elected for God's purpose
[1:04:45] for an outcome.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; A predetermined outcome. And he needs
[1:04:49] this brotherhood. The enemy wants to
[1:04:52] divide the brotherhood to prevent the
[1:04:54] outcome. Your purpose is to keep the
[1:04:56] brotherhood.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; And what do they do? Now everybody looks
[1:05:04] at doctrines. Oh, it is the doctrines
[1:05:06] divided. No, wasn't the doctrines. The
[1:05:09] first division began because of human
[1:05:11] leadership recognition and relevance.
[1:05:15] Not even doctrines. Doctrines. I think I
[1:05:19] believe doctrines was just a an excuse.
[1:05:22] The real reason is each one wanted to be
[1:05:25] more important than the other one.
[1:05:29] Who was closer to Christ than the other?
[1:05:32] This is a very big and serious subject
[1:05:34] when you consider what has happened to
[1:05:36] the Christian church since the beginning
[1:05:38] and the message since the beginning. So
[1:05:41] since the beginning of Christianity,
[1:05:43] what happened? Nicicoatans came in
[1:05:46] and the church split in Smyrna and
[1:05:49] divided into false church and true
[1:05:52] church and even within the true church
[1:05:54] division came in. In other words,
[1:05:56] exactly what Christ said, Satan has
[1:05:58] desired to divide you.
[1:06:01] What is your job? Strengthen your
[1:06:04] brethren. Okay,
[1:06:07] we are so divided and yet the ministry
[1:06:11] was given for what? Now this is this is
[1:06:14] what brother seep read.
[1:06:18] He read exactly what I'm about to tell
[1:06:20] you. Right? And we spoke about this on
[1:06:23] Wednesday when I spoke about um Aaron
[1:06:27] being anointed with the oil and the
[1:06:29] blood. And the psalm of David was about
[1:06:32] how sweet is the oil that was poured
[1:06:34] upon Aaron. How good and how pleasant it
[1:06:38] is for brothers to dwell in unity. Amen.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; It is like the oil.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; What was the oil? The oil is connecting.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; The oil connects us. The oil connects us
[1:06:53] to God.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; The oil connects us to the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:57] If you have the oil and I have the oil,
[1:06:59] we are connected.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Satan wants to divide us to do what? To
[1:07:05] prevent the purpose of God.
[1:07:09] So let's go to Ephesians. Ephesians
[1:07:12] chapter 4 2:3. I don't want to preach
[1:07:14] too much on this. I want to read this
[1:07:15] and then we're going to close.
[1:07:18] Uh, of course, I will say some of it and
[1:07:20] I want to give some encouragement to you
[1:07:24] and our the preachers in our church and
[1:07:27] maybe brothers in the message to
[1:07:28] actually get into this. Ephesians 4 2:3.
[1:07:31] Are you all ready? with all loneliness
[1:07:34] and meekness, with longsuffering,
[1:07:36] forebearing one another in love,
[1:07:39] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:07:43] spirit in the bond of peace. And that's
[1:07:45] what our brother was praying. How is it
[1:07:47] that we are united? It is by your holy
[1:07:50] spirit. If it were not for the holy
[1:07:52] spirit, we would not be united. So watch
[1:07:55] this carefully. This is not saying go
[1:07:58] and make the unity. They're saying keep
[1:08:02] the unity.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; The unity is already given.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; What are we united around? The word.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; You are instructed by God your purpose,
[1:08:14] your calling as brothers of of uh of of
[1:08:19] the word to keep the unity
[1:08:23] in the bond of peace. All right. Let's
[1:08:25] look at what the ministry verse 11-16.
[1:08:28] Ephesians 4:11-16. He gave some
[1:08:31] apostles, some prophets, some
[1:08:32] evangelists, some pastors, and some
[1:08:34] teachers. I love this ministers in the
[1:08:36] messages. Stop there.
[1:08:39] Verse, by the way, I want you to do
[1:08:41] this. Go home and read this whole
[1:08:45] chapter, particularly after verse 16.
[1:08:48] Okay? Read it. We are going to read it
[1:08:51] today, but I want you to go back. Do
[1:08:52] this with your families.
[1:08:55] All right? Are you still with us? Yeah.
[1:08:57] He gave the ministry, the five-fold
[1:08:59] ministry, prophets, pastors, teachers,
[1:09:01] evangelists, and so on. For what?
[1:09:06] What? For
[1:09:09] the perfecting of the saints, for the
[1:09:12] work of the ministry, for the edifying
[1:09:15] of the body of Christ. So, apostles,
[1:09:18] prophets, evangelists, pastors, and
[1:09:20] teachers are who? They are leaders who
[1:09:24] are servants.
[1:09:27] They are those who are greater who are
[1:09:30] supposed to esteem themselves lesser.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; For what purpose? To serve those who
[1:09:38] have less than them.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; To do what? To strengthen the
[1:09:43] brotherhood. To bring unity.
[1:09:47] To bring completion. Right. Perfecting
[1:09:49] of the saints for the work of the
[1:09:51] ministry. For the edifying of the body
[1:09:53] of Christ. What is edifying? feeding my
[1:09:56] sheep.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; Till what? There's a there's an
[1:10:02] expiration date
[1:10:05] because we've got to do all this. We've
[1:10:07] got to serve until what?
[1:10:09] Till we all come in the unity of the
[1:10:12] faith. You don't stop working until we
[1:10:15] all come to the unity of the faith.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Right. and the knowledge of the son of
[1:10:20] God. That's the revelation of Christ
[1:10:22] unto a perfect man. What's the what's
[1:10:25] the desired outcome? That all of us must
[1:10:28] come to the the stature of a perfect
[1:10:30] man.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; That's what you are predestinated to
[1:10:34] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:10:36] fullness of Christ that
[1:10:39] we may be no more children.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this I could take a whole year
[1:10:48] on, but it'll be mostly criticizing you.
[1:10:51] I wouldn't do that.
[1:10:54] That we be no more children tossed to
[1:10:56] and fro, carried about with every wind
[1:10:59] of doctrine by the slight of men. That's
[1:11:02] like in my words, it's going to be of
[1:11:04] how silly you are that you're taken by
[1:11:07] suave, charismatic pastors and preachers
[1:11:11] and ministers who walk up and down
[1:11:13] putting a spell on you by their charisma
[1:11:16] and their gifts, by the slight of men.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; You are swayed by every wind of
[1:11:22] doctrine, cunning craftiness
[1:11:26] whereby they lie in weight. They lie in
[1:11:29] weight means they design it to deceive
[1:11:32] you.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; They deise a message to deceive you.
[1:11:37] They devise their charisma. They devise
[1:11:39] their their musicians. They deise their
[1:11:42] movement in their church to deceive you.
[1:11:45] To capture your soul, to capture your
[1:11:48] heart. Who benefits?
[1:11:51] They benefit. According to Christ's
[1:11:54] word, they should not be the benefit.
[1:11:57] They should not be the benefactors.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; The people must be the benefactors.
[1:12:04] Verse for uh verse 15. But speaking the
[1:12:09] truth in love may grow up unto him in
[1:12:12] all things which is the head, even
[1:12:13] Christ from whom the whole body fitly
[1:12:17] joined together. This is the part that I
[1:12:19] love. Can you see it? The whole body
[1:12:23] fitly joined together. perfectly placed
[1:12:26] together, compacted by every joint,
[1:12:31] right? By every joint supplieth,
[1:12:35] according to the effectual working in
[1:12:37] the measure of every part, maketh
[1:12:40] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:12:42] of itself.
[1:12:44] The whole gift is supposed to bring the
[1:12:47] body of Christ to be perfect, fitted
[1:12:50] together in perfect unity, completely
[1:12:53] strong enough to edify itself,
[1:12:57] to sustain itself,
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; not to be dependent.
[1:13:06] Yeah. I would like it if we all studied
[1:13:08] for our own personal understanding and
[1:13:10] also if the ministry of the church, if
[1:13:11] our brothers who preach can take it upon
[1:13:13] themselves to take these particular
[1:13:15] things. I I put them down. There's six
[1:13:16] things. If you can display them,
[1:13:19] speaking the truth in love, the whole
[1:13:21] body fitly joined together, compacted by
[1:13:24] that which every joint supply. Every
[1:13:27] joint supply. Compacted.
[1:13:32] Look into it, brothers. according to the
[1:13:34] effectual working in the measure of
[1:13:37] every part.
[1:13:39] If if you read this, you'll understand
[1:13:43] there is no insignificant person in our
[1:13:46] church.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Making increase of the body.
[1:13:53] You want to know what's purpose in your
[1:13:56] church? Look to your left and right and
[1:13:59] ask yourself how you can increase your
[1:14:02] brother in the faith
[1:14:06] in the faith in the life how you can
[1:14:08] lift them out of a burden to make their
[1:14:11] faith stronger
[1:14:13] then you won't be coming to ask me
[1:14:15] brother Al what can I what position can
[1:14:17] I have what designation can I and the
[1:14:20] best thing about this is you'll do
[1:14:22] something like that without anyone
[1:14:24] knowing you did it
[1:14:27] Because the left hand doesn't need to
[1:14:28] tell the right hand what it's doing.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; You don't need to even take recognition
[1:14:33] for it.
[1:14:36] You want examples? We'll have a meeting.
[1:14:38] I'll give you plenty of examples.
[1:14:42] Not today.
[1:14:44] Maketh increase of the body unto the
[1:14:46] edifying of itself in love. Saints the
[1:14:50] ministry.
[1:14:52] I mean, if if I look at Ephesians 4, if
[1:14:55] I look at what Christ told Peter about
[1:14:57] us being divided, the enemy wants to
[1:15:00] sift us like wheat. If I if I look at
[1:15:03] Ephesians 4 from the beginning, what the
[1:15:04] five-fold ministry is given, what is
[1:15:06] spoken of here from verse 11-6 and I ask
[1:15:10] myself, what have the ministry in the
[1:15:13] message done with this?
[1:15:16] We've divided itself. We speak against
[1:15:19] one another.
[1:15:21] Those folks who say now we must press
[1:15:25] play and obey.
[1:15:28] I I want to ask you a question. Do you
[1:15:31] really think in your heart of hearts you
[1:15:35] are going in the rapture without me?
[1:15:39] Do you really think that?
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Not a chance my friend.
[1:15:45] Whether you press play and obey or you
[1:15:47] do whatever you you are not going in the
[1:15:49] rapture 5 minutes before me.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; How about you Peruia folks? How about
[1:15:58] you seven thunder folks? Holy Ghost
[1:16:00] folks. How about you ABC's only folks?
[1:16:03] Do you think you are going in the
[1:16:05] rapture 5 minutes before me? Do you
[1:16:07] really think you are going in the
[1:16:09] rapture without us?
[1:16:15] Not a chance.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; Just because you disagree with me on one
[1:16:22] or two things or because I preach
[1:16:25] slightly different to you, is it enough
[1:16:28] to throw a fit and increase yourself to
[1:16:30] decrease others?
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; How about you in the local churches?
[1:16:37] Do you spur on and support such
[1:16:39] anti-body
[1:16:41] behavior?
[1:16:44] How how is what you're doing criticizing
[1:16:47] everybody else online shouting at other
[1:16:50] people telling us we must press play on
[1:16:53] obey or we must be Perushia or we must
[1:16:55] be seven times or we must be this or
[1:16:57] that or else. Where do you get the gull
[1:17:01] to do that? To think you would be better
[1:17:04] than everyone else purely because your
[1:17:07] expression of the message is different
[1:17:09] to somebody else's.
[1:17:11] And when you look at that scripture that
[1:17:12] says Satan has desired to have you to
[1:17:16] sift you like wheat, you are
[1:17:18] accomplishing the purpose of Satan.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; That's amen.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; You are not seeking to bring the
[1:17:26] brotherhood together. You are not
[1:17:29] seeking to strengthen. You are being
[1:17:31] used as a tool to divide people.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:35] You are segregating the bride of Christ
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; into labels, blasphemous names.
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; So if after all these years you still
[1:17:50] think you have allowed the enemy to sift
[1:17:54] you like wheat, you still children
[1:17:57] tossed to and fro
[1:18:00] away from the unity of the faith and the
[1:18:01] stature of Christ. If you still think
[1:18:04] you can put a a man today above every
[1:18:10] other man in the message,
[1:18:12] you're doing exactly what he said was
[1:18:14] going to happen.
[1:18:16] The day you think I am going to let you
[1:18:19] do that to me is the day we'll part
[1:18:22] ways.
[1:18:25] There is no way my name or who I am is
[1:18:29] going to be elevated over other people
[1:18:33] to that the moment somebody looks to me
[1:18:36] to be some leader of the world is the
[1:18:38] day I quit
[1:18:41] not quit preaching
[1:18:44] quit
[1:18:45] right
[1:18:47] because I've got to still do what I have
[1:18:49] to do to bring the bride of Christ
[1:18:52] according to the way God has chosen me
[1:18:53] to speak. I must speak what he has
[1:18:56] revealed to me. I cannot speak anything
[1:18:58] else. So to me, if some brother preaches
[1:19:01] the seventh seal in the way that he
[1:19:03] preaches, I want to hear it.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; I cannot believe that the way I see the
[1:19:10] seventh seal. So, so let me say it this
[1:19:11] way. If you and I see the seventh seal
[1:19:14] in a way that brings us to the knowledge
[1:19:17] that we are supposed to be Christ made
[1:19:19] flesh in this day and part of the coming
[1:19:22] of Christ, that's great. If another
[1:19:25] brother interprets the same seals
[1:19:27] message in a way to bring the same
[1:19:30] outcome,
[1:19:32] praise be to God.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Because what's important is the outcome.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:40] So if I'm going to allow myself to rise
[1:19:43] because I think the way I see something
[1:19:46] is the only way it has to be seen, then
[1:19:48] I'm dividing the brotherhood.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; I must recognize Peter has a ministry.
[1:19:54] James has a ministry. Matthew has a
[1:19:56] ministry. John has a ministry. Paul has
[1:19:59] a ministry.
[1:20:01] Matias has a ministry. Everyone has a
[1:20:04] ministry to see a the same Christ in a
[1:20:08] different way and preach it to a
[1:20:09] different people in a particular way to
[1:20:12] produce the same outcome.
[1:20:18] Where are we concerning Ephesians
[1:20:20] 4:11-16?
[1:20:22] You want to talk about purpose? Here we
[1:20:25] are.
[1:20:27] Now I want us to as a church I'm going
[1:20:30] to read the last part of this and then
[1:20:32] we can close.
[1:20:34] I want us to see the character. You talk
[1:20:37] about conversion. Everybody wants to
[1:20:39] talk about conversion like you know I
[1:20:42] gave up smoking. I gave up being of
[1:20:44] another religion. Now I'm a Christian. I
[1:20:46] I was a denominational but now I'm a I'm
[1:20:49] a message believer.
[1:20:51] You you know denomination. You came here
[1:20:53] and became another. You became a message
[1:20:55] believer denomination.
[1:20:57] You didn't convert.
[1:21:00] You just left one religion for another
[1:21:02] religion.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Let's see about conversion.
[1:21:06] Verse 17 and verse 32.
[1:21:09] Brothers, families, this is the part I
[1:21:12] say you must read. This is the part I
[1:21:14] say we must judge ourselves by
[1:21:19] to know whether you are being converted
[1:21:21] to strengthen your brethren. This I say
[1:21:24] therefore and testify in the Lord that
[1:21:26] you henceforth walk not as other
[1:21:29] Gentiles walk in the vanity of their
[1:21:32] mind.
[1:21:33] Start there.
[1:21:36] Do I walk in the vanity as other
[1:21:41] Gentiles walk? Is my everyday life lived
[1:21:46] for the purpose of God or for the
[1:21:48] purpose of the Gentiles?
[1:21:51] Nobody can tell you that. Only you can
[1:21:54] tell yourself that. This is where it
[1:21:56] starts. Having the understanding
[1:21:59] darkened,
[1:22:01] being alienated from the life of God
[1:22:04] through ignorance that is in them.
[1:22:08] You all sitting here will say, "No, no
[1:22:10] ways." You know, I'm I I'm not
[1:22:12] alienated. I I don't have my
[1:22:14] understanding darkened. I'm not
[1:22:15] alienated from the life of God through
[1:22:17] ignorance. Are you not
[1:22:21] alienated?
[1:22:25] Do you choose a life of isolation from
[1:22:28] God's people?
[1:22:31] How how together are you with the
[1:22:33] purpose of God's word?
[1:22:37] How together, how united are you
[1:22:40] together with the purpose of this
[1:22:42] church?
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a quote brother
[1:22:45] Baron says? You should desire that your
[1:22:48] church should succeed.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Do you
[1:22:57] succeed in what?
[1:23:00] Right. because of the blindness of their
[1:23:03] heart, who being past feeling have been
[1:23:08] have given themselves over unto
[1:23:09] lasciviousness to walk to work all
[1:23:13] uncleanness with greediness,
[1:23:16] but you have not so learned Christ. If
[1:23:18] so be that you have heard him and have
[1:23:20] been taught by him as the truth is in
[1:23:23] Jesus. Here it is that you put off
[1:23:27] concerning the former conversation the
[1:23:30] old man
[1:23:32] for me to see
[1:23:35] decades later
[1:23:37] people's true colors showing now
[1:23:40] of what they always were
[1:23:43] to to come to a stage now where you can
[1:23:46] totally lose the plot and act like an
[1:23:48] univilized unsaved person in the message
[1:23:53] is beyond me. It does nothing to fulfill
[1:23:56] the purpose of God.
[1:23:59] Right? Which is corrupt according to the
[1:24:02] deceitful lust. Be renewed in the spirit
[1:24:05] of your mind. There's a whole series
[1:24:07] alto together.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That you put on the new man. There's
[1:24:11] another series.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Which after God is created in
[1:24:14] righteousness and true holiness, which
[1:24:16] is what we were speaking of recently,
[1:24:18] consecration.
[1:24:20] How about this?
[1:24:22] putting away lying.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you right now, the majority
[1:24:29] of message people have not overcome
[1:24:31] this.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; You still lie to each other. You still
[1:24:36] lie to your husbands and wives. You lie
[1:24:37] to your children. You lie to your
[1:24:39] parents. You lie to your ministers. You
[1:24:41] lie to your deacons. You lie to your
[1:24:42] boss. You lie to your school. You lie to
[1:24:45] your teachers. You lie to everybody. You
[1:24:48] cannot be a person who strengthens the
[1:24:50] brethren while you lie.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Put away lying. Nobody talks about this.
[1:25:00] How about converting from this? If if
[1:25:02] nobody lies in this place, I tell you,
[1:25:04] we'll have a fantastic time.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Speak every man truth with his neighbor.
[1:25:13] You know, I I had some people
[1:25:16] in my life as a minister. They did
[1:25:18] something wrong.
[1:25:20] They they came here to confess not
[1:25:24] because they were sorry. They came here
[1:25:26] to confess because they were caught.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:31] and took advantage of the forgiveness of
[1:25:34] our people because our people hugged
[1:25:36] them, cried with them, gave them grace,
[1:25:40] and then they go off and spurn it and
[1:25:42] slap us in the face with it. But they
[1:25:44] were not confessing because they truly
[1:25:48] had a heart that was contrite and
[1:25:51] desired to be right with God. If they
[1:25:54] had not been caught out, they would not
[1:25:56] have confessed.
[1:25:57] Yeah.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; And yet we've got to do what the church
[1:26:01] is meant to do. We've got to forgive.
[1:26:04] We've got to still try and help you. But
[1:26:06] because you didn't confess with a
[1:26:08] contrite heart in the beginning, because
[1:26:10] you didn't put away lying, you pay for
[1:26:13] it.
[1:26:16] Speak every man truth. For we are
[1:26:18] members one of another. We owe it to
[1:26:22] ourselves, to our brothers to live in
[1:26:24] the light. When I say walk in the light,
[1:26:27] I mean tell the truth. Be open. Let your
[1:26:31] yay be yay in your navy nay. Don't let
[1:26:33] someone have to constantly check what
[1:26:36] you are saying whether it is true or not
[1:26:38] or suspect you. Did this happen? 20
[1:26:40] questions. Just say the right thing from
[1:26:42] the first. So you don't go through 20
[1:26:44] questions.
[1:26:47] How about this? Verse 26. Be you angry
[1:26:50] and sin not. He's actually telling you
[1:26:53] you can get angry.
[1:26:57] I love getting angry.
[1:27:00] It makes me test myself.
[1:27:03] Makes me get better. Be angry and sin
[1:27:06] not.
[1:27:08] This is important for one another
[1:27:11] because you can be angry and sin. What
[1:27:13] is the sin? What is the sin? Anybody?
[1:27:17] What is the sin? Going to bed, fuming,
[1:27:20] ignoring people. No, the sin is breaking
[1:27:23] up the brotherhood.
[1:27:26] The sin is dividing your brothers. Be
[1:27:30] angry with one another and sin not
[1:27:33] against the body. Do not resent the
[1:27:36] movement of the Holy Spirit. Do not
[1:27:37] resent the Holy Ghost. Do not divide one
[1:27:40] another from one another. Be angry and
[1:27:43] sin not. Do not lessen your brother's
[1:27:45] testimony while speaking to somebody
[1:27:47] else.
[1:27:49] What What is Ephesians 4 about? the
[1:27:51] unity of the body.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; Neither give place to the devil. Devil
[1:27:59] is a false accuser. There it is.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Right. Don't give place to false
[1:28:03] accusers.
[1:28:05] Verse 28. I love this. Let him that
[1:28:08] stole steal no more. That means you
[1:28:10] might very well have a thief in your
[1:28:11] church.
[1:28:15] Let him that steal that stole steal no
[1:28:19] more. And then what do you do? Put him
[1:28:21] to work. Let him labor working with his
[1:28:24] hands. Take that thief and make him do
[1:28:27] honest work with his hands in the thing
[1:28:30] which is good. And then he must with the
[1:28:34] work he must be able to give back
[1:28:37] to him that need it.
[1:28:40] That's him putting his life of stealing.
[1:28:43] Right.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; You know what these people who come to
[1:28:46] message churches? I feel like message
[1:28:48] churches are places for miscarrians to
[1:28:51] come here and hide.
[1:28:55] You know, we live righteous.
[1:28:59] We live our lives. We don't go drinking,
[1:29:01] smoking, fornicating, adulterating. We
[1:29:04] we marry a girl. We have our our family.
[1:29:08] We bring up our sons, our children in
[1:29:10] the right way. We we suffer with making
[1:29:12] the right decisions only to fund your
[1:29:15] irresponsibility.
[1:29:18] and you come here asking for handouts
[1:29:21] because it's the church's right to
[1:29:23] support you and then you still go back
[1:29:25] and live this irresponsible life. Sorry,
[1:29:28] not happening.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; I don't live my life responsibly so I
[1:29:34] can fund your irresponsible life. Don't
[1:29:36] come and ask me for a loan when you act
[1:29:38] irresponsibly. There's a scripture here
[1:29:40] for you. You that stole, steal no more.
[1:29:43] Do honest work. Get something so you
[1:29:46] give back to others. That's how you get
[1:29:48] rid of your reputation of stealing.
[1:29:51] It's in the Bible. And that's how you
[1:29:54] will actually strengthen your
[1:29:55] brotherhood.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Verse 29. Let no corrupt communication
[1:30:00] proceed out of your mouth.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; But that which is
[1:30:05] after so far, how many of you have been
[1:30:07] converted?
[1:30:12] You're laughing.
[1:30:16] But that which is good to the use of
[1:30:18] edifying, it means whatever you speak to
[1:30:20] your brothers and sisters must edify.
[1:30:23] Right? That it may minister grace unto
[1:30:26] the hearers.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[1:30:32] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[1:30:34] your redemption. This people use as in
[1:30:36] don't go and backslide. You're grieving
[1:30:39] the Holy Spirit. He's like a dove. He's
[1:30:42] fly away when you do something wrong.
[1:30:44] When you go smoke that cigarette, it's
[1:30:46] not talking about that. He already knew
[1:30:48] you were going to do that. Grieve not
[1:30:50] the Holy Spirit that binds the people
[1:30:52] together. This entire chapter is about
[1:30:55] the unity of the body.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse
[1:31:00] 31. Let all bitterness, wrath, anger,
[1:31:05] clamor, evil speaking be put away from
[1:31:07] you with all malice, and be kind one to
[1:31:11] another, tender-hearted, forgiving one
[1:31:13] another, even as God for Christ's sake
[1:31:16] has forgiven you.
[1:31:20] Everything in Ephesians 4 is speaking
[1:31:22] about strengthening your brethren. How
[1:31:24] many of you want purpose?
[1:31:26] You got the way I see it, we have a lot
[1:31:28] to work on.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Before if you don't have this desire for
[1:31:38] the strengthening of the brethren and
[1:31:40] the souls that are in your church, how
[1:31:43] will you have the desire for souls
[1:31:44] outside?
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't. That is the reason you
[1:31:49] don't testify because you are not even
[1:31:51] united with your own people.
[1:31:54] You distrust one another. You lie to
[1:31:56] each other. You're not honest with each
[1:31:58] other. You esteem others higher than
[1:32:01] others. As long as you do that, you are
[1:32:04] not one body. You are not work. It's
[1:32:06] like a crowd. See, when when a crowd has
[1:32:09] purpose, it's moving together. It's
[1:32:10] closer. It's closely knit. You are like
[1:32:13] a crowd dispersed. And as this dispersed
[1:32:16] crowd, you're moving while you can see
[1:32:18] each other in the distance.
[1:32:20] And when the herd is dispersed, the
[1:32:23] enemy can pick you off one by one.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Learn a little bit from the African
[1:32:28] buffalo. Stick together.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Stand for one another. Hold up each
[1:32:34] other's testimonies. Esteem your brother
[1:32:37] higher than yourself.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Every one of those underlined phrases
[1:32:42] requires a serious discussion. If I had
[1:32:45] to do church camps or family camps, this
[1:32:48] is what I'll do. I wouldn't waste my
[1:32:50] time on multitudes of song specials at
[1:32:52] camps and preachers outperforming one
[1:32:55] another. What a waste of time. All you
[1:32:58] achieve is having a good time.
[1:33:01] This is the stuff you should actually
[1:33:02] talk about at church camps.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Strengthening your brethren.
[1:33:07] Strengthening your brethren. In closing,
[1:33:08] it's not about,
[1:33:10] you know, something bad happens to your
[1:33:12] brother, they're sick. This is how you
[1:33:14] know this the cell phone, WhatsApp, all
[1:33:17] of that is providing a really
[1:33:21] weak response.
[1:33:23] Just so you send a message, we're
[1:33:25] praying for you. We're good. Then I
[1:33:26] forget about you for 7 days.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Right? That's how it is. It's so good.
[1:33:32] It's so convenient. It's what's
[1:33:33] happening. It's where you're heading to.
[1:33:35] Right? And this is so strengthening your
[1:33:39] brethren is not about when he's in a bad
[1:33:42] situation, pat him on the back. It's
[1:33:44] don't worry brother, it's going to be
[1:33:45] okay. God knows all things. He knows all
[1:33:47] that. What are you telling him that for?
[1:33:49] He knows that all himself when he prays,
[1:33:51] God even tells him that. He doesn't need
[1:33:53] to tell you, pet him on the back. Don't
[1:33:55] worry, brother. We hug him. We're here
[1:33:57] for you. We here for you mean how? Just
[1:33:59] to hug me and tell me it's going to be
[1:34:00] okay.
[1:34:03] Strengthening your brotherhood.
[1:34:05] Strengthening the brotherhood means
[1:34:08] preventing division,
[1:34:12] patching up division
[1:34:15] caused by an enemy, restoring unity that
[1:34:19] has been lost, focusing on what divided
[1:34:22] us, target it, and bring out the truth.
[1:34:27] You know what's the real problem I see
[1:34:29] with our generation is you're afraid of
[1:34:32] the truth. You're afraid to confront the
[1:34:34] truth.
[1:34:35] And this is the problem. More than
[1:34:37] likely, if I confront you with the
[1:34:40] truth, you will leave the church.
[1:34:43] That's your solution.
[1:34:46] Leave the church. Instead of admitting
[1:34:49] the truth or working, brother Al, what
[1:34:52] can I do to make this right? What can I
[1:34:55] do to make this better? You don't even
[1:34:57] see the value in that. When you leave
[1:35:00] the church, you tell your child, "This
[1:35:03] is how we solve problems.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; This is how we do things. We speak truth
[1:35:09] to power. We'll let the preachers know.
[1:35:13] We give them
[1:35:15] the third degree. We'll sort them out."
[1:35:19] What you don't realize is that child is
[1:35:21] going to grow up and give you the third
[1:35:22] degree
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; pretty soon because you just taught them
[1:35:26] how to deal with conflict. leave the
[1:35:29] church, speak to the hand.
[1:35:33] H that's what you teach them. That's
[1:35:36] what they're going to do to you.
[1:35:38] So this is why if myself or the deacon
[1:35:42] has to confront you and actually tell
[1:35:44] you the plain old cutting truth, will
[1:35:47] you have the character to remain and
[1:35:50] strengthen the brethren or will you fold
[1:35:52] up and leave the church?
[1:35:56] The majority of people choose the
[1:35:58] latter. Leave the church because they
[1:36:00] don't want to confront the truth and
[1:36:02] then leave the church and say, "If you
[1:36:04] speak about me, I'll bring the law
[1:36:05] against you."
[1:36:07] Defamation.
[1:36:11] Saints,
[1:36:13] you may think it's doctrines that
[1:36:15] divided us. It's not. It was always
[1:36:17] human leadership.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Always. It's not doctrines.
[1:36:22] uh always men desiring to be high than
[1:36:24] when it started with the perua with the
[1:36:27] seven thunders whichever doctrine came
[1:36:29] up it was because other men were feeling
[1:36:31] they were more important than others.
[1:36:33] The doctrines I think were like the
[1:36:35] thing that they used to make them higher
[1:36:37] than someone else.
[1:36:40] Amen. It was the same in the time of
[1:36:42] Christ. It was the same in the church
[1:36:44] ages. It is the same in the message
[1:36:45] today. Unity can only exist by the Holy
[1:36:48] Spirit. By one spirit are you baptized
[1:36:51] into one body. Humility, truth and
[1:36:53] righteousness will restore the unity of
[1:36:56] the faith. First you have to be united
[1:36:59] in faith.
[1:37:01] Two cannot walk together unless they be
[1:37:03] agree.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; So we can actually be a body of this
[1:37:06] church if we agree on what is being
[1:37:09] preached. If we see the same thing. If
[1:37:12] we agree in faith. We don't have to
[1:37:14] understand it all the same way. Exactly
[1:37:17] the same. But we can all agree the
[1:37:20] seventh seal is open. The book has come
[1:37:21] down. We are part of the bride of
[1:37:23] Christ. We are becoming him. We all
[1:37:26] agree on that. How you see it is a
[1:37:28] different story. We can work together.
[1:37:31] We are here to work together to get each
[1:37:33] joint fitly compacting everything
[1:37:36] together. Right?
[1:37:38] You don't come here
[1:37:41] to make unity. You come here to keep the
[1:37:44] unity. Amen.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; You don't come here for a free ride.
[1:37:48] That's not how church works. You prove
[1:37:51] yourself by making a commitment.
[1:37:54] Right. And I feel like the model of the
[1:37:57] Christian church has changed. And I'm
[1:38:00] not sure I I'm being honest with you. I
[1:38:02] don't think it can ever go back to the
[1:38:03] way it was meant to be. Um, for example,
[1:38:08] when the first church began, you had all
[1:38:11] the disciples, you know, all the
[1:38:13] disciples had wives and children,
[1:38:16] but they were commissioned by God to
[1:38:17] take the gospel to the world. So, they
[1:38:21] had no jobs.
[1:38:25] They were commissioned to take the
[1:38:26] gospel to the world. Who takes care of
[1:38:28] the wife and children back home? So,
[1:38:30] what do they do? They brought everything
[1:38:32] they owned together and they dispersed.
[1:38:35] They divided their stuff among one
[1:38:37] another.
[1:38:40] How many of you will divide your pension
[1:38:42] fund with me
[1:38:45] or your house or lend me your car?
[1:38:49] Do you know what it was like in the days
[1:38:51] when the message first came?
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; A brother who was a rich brother would
[1:38:54] lend you his Mercedes Benz to take the
[1:38:57] message to a place where we had to cross
[1:38:59] a river. Most of you would not do that
[1:39:02] today.
[1:39:03] That's how times are changed. You need
[1:39:06] your car. You have to go to work. You
[1:39:08] have to do this. You have to do You're
[1:39:10] already esteeming your life above the
[1:39:13] purpose of the gospel because you've
[1:39:15] gotten so into this thing that the only
[1:39:17] thing we have to do is come to church on
[1:39:19] Sundays and listen to the message and go
[1:39:22] back home and live our lives. There's no
[1:39:26] thought of passing the word on. There's
[1:39:27] no thought. Do you think I've got money
[1:39:30] lying around in my bank to fund my own
[1:39:32] trips overseas?
[1:39:34] I don't have that. If somebody doesn't
[1:39:37] fund my trip to go somewhere, I can't
[1:39:39] go.
[1:39:41] Do you did you ever think about where
[1:39:42] that money must come from?
[1:39:46] And this is not me asking you for money.
[1:39:48] I would never do that. Literally, a
[1:39:50] brother who invites me will have to pay
[1:39:52] for my trip. He will have to pay my
[1:39:54] plane ticket. Of course, I would take
[1:39:55] care of my visas and whatnot. all that
[1:39:58] and and get to go over there and preach
[1:40:01] the word of God. The model of the church
[1:40:04] has changed because we no longer have
[1:40:06] the desire in our churches to spread the
[1:40:09] gospel. We have this desire to make this
[1:40:13] benefit me.
[1:40:16] How does this benefit me?
[1:40:20] That's the problem. That's your problem.
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:28] I'm not speaking to anyone else. I'm
[1:40:29] speaking to you in this church. Your
[1:40:31] mentality is how this church benefits
[1:40:34] me.
[1:40:36] You know what's your problem? You pay
[1:40:38] tithes to the pastor and therefore the
[1:40:41] pastor is obligated to serve you.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; That's what you think. That's what
[1:40:50] churches think.
[1:40:52] It's like a transaction. Did you really
[1:40:55] think you pay tithe so I can serve you?
[1:40:59] You might as well leave right now
[1:41:02] because I don't believe that. Do you
[1:41:04] know why the Levites were not given an
[1:41:06] inheritance
[1:41:08] in the promised land?
[1:41:11] They were not given land. Do you know
[1:41:12] why? Because they could not spend time
[1:41:16] with their own job.
[1:41:19] I am perfectly capable to earn my own
[1:41:22] living with my intelligence and my gifts
[1:41:25] that I have. I am here because God has
[1:41:28] chosen me to give you the word.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; You are not paying me to do that.
[1:41:37] If you do that, you have a carnal mind
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; and you are not even joined with the
[1:41:42] body.
[1:41:44] So when bad things happen to you and you
[1:41:47] think you paying me tithe and I didn't
[1:41:51] call you when you was sick, you already
[1:41:54] have a wrong idea
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; because you already think that I owe you
[1:41:59] services because you pay tithe to me.
[1:42:04] And this goes for all the message
[1:42:05] churches.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Why would you leave a church for
[1:42:10] personal differences?
[1:42:13] That's what Christ said the enemy wants
[1:42:16] to do.
[1:42:18] Right. Here's the truth. If somebody is
[1:42:22] sick in your area and you stay in that
[1:42:24] area, you are the one supposed to visit
[1:42:27] them.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; You are the one who supposed to raise
[1:42:30] your brother out from his situation.
[1:42:32] It's not the pastor's job to do that
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; because you pay me tithe.
[1:42:40] It's not. My job is not to sit at
[1:42:42] tables. My job is not to apply the bomb
[1:42:46] and gillad for you. And I am not
[1:42:48] supposed to feel threatened because you
[1:42:50] pay my tithes. I have to be so annoyed
[1:42:53] and call you in case you stop paying me
[1:42:55] tithes.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; Then I am not even called.
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; See what what do we really want? This is
[1:43:06] my problem. We want purpose in church
[1:43:09] but we are forgetting our purpose.
[1:43:13] You will have
[1:43:15] you will have poor people in your church
[1:43:19] who you may not know has lost their job
[1:43:22] or not have enough finances for their
[1:43:24] child to be educated. But you will
[1:43:27] invest in gold and silver for another
[1:43:29] company and see no reason to invest in
[1:43:32] the education of one of the body of
[1:43:35] Christ.
[1:43:38] And you can't see that you could put
[1:43:40] away so much a month to educate a child
[1:43:44] who has less than you in your body which
[1:43:47] you call the church who you say you are
[1:43:49] bonded with and you are one body. You
[1:43:52] will not because you will care for
[1:43:54] yourself.
[1:43:56] You don't realize the Bible tells you if
[1:43:59] you take care of someone, you invest in
[1:44:02] another child in this church, the one
[1:44:04] day when you grow up, you're all alone,
[1:44:06] your family's gone, your husband has
[1:44:07] died, your wife has died, your children
[1:44:09] have left you, that one will take care
[1:44:11] of you.
[1:44:14] That's what happens in the body of
[1:44:16] Christ. That child you invested in will
[1:44:19] actually take care of you. But on the
[1:44:21] pathway, you don't realize the purpose
[1:44:24] of God and what it will do for you.
[1:44:27] This is the purpose failing in message
[1:44:31] churches because we are too concerned
[1:44:35] with self.
[1:44:36] You want purpose? What purpose? You you
[1:44:39] can't sail across the sea while you
[1:44:42] can't save someone right here in your
[1:44:44] church.
[1:44:49] Nobody else takes accountability for
[1:44:51] members of the local church. That's how
[1:44:53] it is. It's the pastor's job. It's
[1:44:55] brother Alistister's church. He must
[1:44:56] take care of them. Brother Alistister's
[1:44:58] wife must talk to the sister who's not
[1:45:01] me. I don't have to. We pay our tithes.
[1:45:04] They must do the job. That's the wrong
[1:45:06] mentality. That's the wrong idea. How
[1:45:09] are you not noticing someone in need?
[1:45:12] How are you not noticing someone who
[1:45:14] needs spiritual upliftment?
[1:45:17] Because if you uplift them spiritually,
[1:45:20] you are doing the purpose of God to
[1:45:22] strengthen the brethren to feed the
[1:45:25] sheep, which is the original purpose God
[1:45:28] gave.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; I am doing my purpose. I am answering
[1:45:34] the call to take the word to the world
[1:45:36] and to give you the word. What call are
[1:45:39] you answering?
[1:45:43] Nothing in Ephesians 4 speaks about our
[1:45:46] doctrines. In a sovereign church, we all
[1:45:48] have the same doctrine. We are not
[1:45:50] divided on doctrines in this place. So
[1:45:52] what prevents us from our purpose in God
[1:45:55] in the message globally? It's our need
[1:45:57] for relevance. Ministers fight at
[1:46:00] pulpits for relevance, for recognition
[1:46:03] that causes us to divide ourselves and
[1:46:06] to devise doctrines, to devise a better
[1:46:09] understanding than another minister. For
[1:46:11] what reason?
[1:46:14] So what do we do, brother Al? You know,
[1:46:16] come together for the sake of it. Just
[1:46:18] put aside our differences and and and
[1:46:20] you know, just be one and love one. That
[1:46:22] sounds ecumenical. Yes, that's exactly
[1:46:25] ecumenical. That's not what we must do.
[1:46:29] None of the things spoken in Ephesians
[1:46:31] 4, Ephesians 4 speaks about doctrines.
[1:46:34] It all speaks about behavior.
[1:46:38] You want to talk about conversion?
[1:46:40] That's the kind of conversion I want to
[1:46:41] see. That's the kind of conversion I
[1:46:44] want to see in myself.
[1:46:46] Amen. It's not our need for relevance.
[1:46:50] These are the behaviors that all fall
[1:46:54] under manipulation, narcissism, and
[1:46:57] nickelotinism.
[1:46:59] Nickelanism was the first speck in the
[1:47:03] first church age.
[1:47:05] What is it? the desire to control the
[1:47:07] leoty.
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; If all church is to us is meeting here
[1:47:12] on Sunday, having a song service,
[1:47:15] listening to the word, going back home,
[1:47:18] and forgetting about our people and our
[1:47:20] purpose.
[1:47:22] We're not strengthening the brother.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Think of this. And this is so apt
[1:47:28] because we are having a brother's
[1:47:30] meeting after the service to talk about
[1:47:32] this.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; We didn't plan it. I certainly didn't
[1:47:36] plan this, but we are talking about
[1:47:38] finding purpose among our brothers.
[1:47:40] We're having we're going to do a
[1:47:42] presentation and have some discussion
[1:47:44] and a little workshop together to
[1:47:46] discuss this. Right? Think of the
[1:47:49] saints. If we overcome these things, we
[1:47:53] will have the ability to hear one
[1:47:54] another and just talk with one another
[1:47:57] without needing to outdo one another.
[1:48:00] Then we can actually strengthen our
[1:48:02] breath. Amen.
[1:48:05] There's a lot more I can speak about
[1:48:06] this, but I think we can probably flesh
[1:48:09] this out further in different messages.
[1:48:12] Our brothers can take it up too, and
[1:48:14] we'll speak a lot more with our
[1:48:15] brothers. There's so many things running
[1:48:17] parallel that we'll be speaking about
[1:48:19] this afternoon in the brother's meeting.
[1:48:20] But for now, let's bow our heads. Let's
[1:48:23] commit ourselves to the Lord
[1:48:25] as we close. Amen.
