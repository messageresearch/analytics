[0:00] verse 37-38.
[0:04] John 18:37-38.
[0:06] And the word of God reads like this.
[0:09] Pilate therefore said unto him, "Art
[0:12] thou a king?" Then Jesus answered, "Thou
[0:15] sayest that I am a king? To this end was
[0:18] I born? For this cause came I into the
[0:21] world, that I should bear witness unto
[0:24] the truth. Everyone that is of the truth
[0:28] heareth my voice. Pilate said unto him,
[0:32] What is truth?
[0:34] And when he had said this, he went out
[0:36] again unto the Jews, and saith unto
[0:39] them, I find in him no fault at all.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; I just want to say this is one of my
[0:45] favorite scriptures in all the Bible. Uh
[0:48] John 8:31-32.
[0:50] Then said Jesus to those Jews which
[0:53] believed on him, "If you continue in my
[0:56] word, then you are my disciples indeed,
[0:59] and you shall know the truth, and the
[1:02] truth shall set you free."
[1:05] So, um, we're on our subject, the story
[1:08] of God and man. This is part five, and
[1:12] our, um, subject, Becoming Sons of God,
[1:16] part four. And our title this morning is
[1:18] sons of god find the truth. Amen. And uh
[1:22] it's quite amazing that we had that
[1:24] little discussion this week from the
[1:25] brothers meeting but uh I want to um uh
[1:30] just introduce the subject to you first.
[1:32] Amen. You happy to be here this morning?
[1:35] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So I think that
[1:38] Pilate's question, Pontius Pilate, the
[1:40] one who was questioning the Lord Jesus
[1:42] Christ, I think his question is one of
[1:45] the most iconic questions ever asked in
[1:48] the Bible. What is truth?
[1:52] Amen. And I'd love to know, I wish I
[1:55] could have seen how he asked it, you
[1:57] know, like with a sigh like what is
[2:01] truth or what is truth or what is truth?
[2:07] You know, the intensity of his voice,
[2:09] the gesture of his hands, just by seeing
[2:12] all that, I would have known quite a bit
[2:13] more than just the question. And I think
[2:17] that it is a conscious or unconscious
[2:20] question in the heart of every person
[2:23] today.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; What is truth? Amen.
[2:28] Uh but that question what is truth was
[2:31] prompted or was a result of the
[2:34] statement that Christ made just before
[2:36] that which is everyone who is of the
[2:40] truth hears my voice. which means
[2:44] firstly of the truth is brings it into
[2:47] our subject sons of God right
[2:50] &gt;&gt; because how can you be of the truth so
[2:53] he's saying it's I mean it's such a
[2:55] massive thing to contemplate to think
[2:57] about that if you are of the truth then
[3:00] you will hear my voice and that simply
[3:02] means if you are of the truth it sounds
[3:06] like you've come from the truth
[3:08] &gt;&gt; yes
[3:09] &gt;&gt; right if you have come from the truth
[3:12] then you will understand my message.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Then you will know what I'm doing here.
[3:18] You wouldn't be questioning me. You
[3:20] would not disbelieve my words that I
[3:23] speak to you. Is that right? So this is
[3:25] where our subject becoming sons of God
[3:28] comes into focus. In John 8:31, he says,
[3:31] "If you continue in my word, then you
[3:35] are my disciples indeed." Now a lot of
[3:37] people thought well that means if I do
[3:39] the word of Jesus Christ then I will
[3:41] become his disciple. That's not what it
[3:43] means. What it means is if you keep his
[3:46] word it proves you are his disciples.
[3:50] Anyone can claim to be his disciples.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; I love that when Peter tried to act like
[3:55] he was not. The woman said your speech
[3:58] betrays you.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Right. So then he says in
[4:03] verse 32, you shall know the truth. If
[4:07] you keep my word, you are my disciples
[4:10] and you shall know the truth. Why?
[4:12] Because you keep my word.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember this when we get to the
[4:16] end. And uh the truth shall set you
[4:20] free.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; You believe that? That's something so
[4:23] many Christians use today. The truth
[4:25] shall set you free. Sets you free.
[4:30] says you are bound.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know only a person who is
[4:37] bound seeks to be free. So this ties in
[4:41] with what we spoke of last week
[4:44] concerning seeking and finding.
[4:47] Right? What need is there to be found
[4:50] unless you are lost?
[4:53] What need was there to search unless
[4:55] there could be something to be found?
[4:58] What need is there to be free unless you
[5:01] are bound? Sounds like a poem. It just
[5:04] becomes better. Amen. So, if you search
[5:08] for the word, you will find truth. There
[5:12] it is. If you search for the word, you
[5:15] will find truth. And what happens when
[5:17] you find truth?
[5:19] You find God.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to talk about truth this
[5:24] morning. I could have titled the service
[5:27] um the truth shall set you free or the
[5:30] truth or the mystery of the truth. But
[5:33] because it's in our subject, we're the
[5:35] title is sons of God will find truth.
[5:40] And if you find truth, you find God.
[5:45] How many people in this world today,
[5:46] right, let's relax and think about this.
[5:49] How many people in this world today
[5:51] believe they tell the truth? Everybody
[5:55] Everybody believes they tell the truth.
[5:57] Everybody believes everybody else
[6:00] doesn't.
[6:02] Right? We hold our government
[6:05] accountable to the truth.
[6:08] But nobody really knows what the truth
[6:10] is.
[6:13] This is the problem.
[6:15] Is that right?
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Like you can tell your child you're not
[6:18] telling the truth.
[6:21] You don't know.
[6:23] You can't prove it. You can try to prove
[6:26] it and then after you try to prove it,
[6:28] but this is what you said. THIS IS WHAT
[6:30] YOU didn't say and then you still don't
[6:32] have the intention.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[6:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:38] &gt;&gt; Let's begin with this quote from the
[6:39] message. Shalom is praying. Our heavenly
[6:42] father, we now bring you to every hand
[6:44] that's up everywhere. And I want you to
[6:46] listen to this. Let the Holy Ghost of
[6:48] God bring to them the rhythm of the word
[6:51] and in its and its truth that they are
[6:55] to be molded now into sons and daughters
[6:57] of God. You notice the Holy Ghost of God
[7:00] bring them the rhythm of the word and
[7:02] its truth that they are to be molded now
[7:04] into sons and daughters of God. I'm
[7:06] showing you the link between truth and
[7:09] becoming sons and daughters of God. You
[7:12] cannot become sons and daughters of God
[7:14] without truth. Amen. The whole thing is
[7:18] about becoming. So we have a problem.
[7:21] The body you are born into is not of
[7:25] truth.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:28] &gt;&gt; The only attribute from the logos is
[7:32] born of truth. That that seed of God
[7:34] that's inside is the only thing that is
[7:37] of truth.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Right? This is why the if you don't
[7:41] agree with me, the Bible tells you you
[7:43] are born into this world. You are
[7:44] conceived in sin, shapen iniquity, and
[7:47] and it says you are you come into this
[7:49] world speaking lies.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; Right? This is why we try and we have
[7:55] the struggle where we're holding each
[7:56] other accountable all the time. In the
[7:58] message, Satan's Eden says, "Now compare
[8:02] God's Eden to Satan's." Now, after 6,000
[8:06] years of perverting of true
[8:08] interpretation of God's promised word to
[8:11] the age, let's compare it now and see
[8:13] where we get. Like he said to the church
[8:15] in Christ's time in Jesus, trying to
[8:18] keep back God's loyal sons from knowing
[8:21] the truth. That's God's God put his sons
[8:26] here, his attributes to fellowship with
[8:29] him by hearing his word.
[8:32] Amen. So what is the enemy trying to do?
[8:35] The lies of the enemy
[8:37] uh is to conceal truth from sons of God
[8:41] to prevent you from fellowship with God.
[8:45] Every lie has the intention to divide.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Right? And what is the meaning of the
[8:54] word devil?
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Liar.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; False accuser. Right?
[9:00] &gt;&gt; If you call someone a devil, you're not
[9:02] saying they're some kind of horny toad
[9:04] with a tail and a fork. You're calling
[9:06] them a liar. In the Bible, the word
[9:08] devil means liar, false accuser, accuser
[9:12] of men, right? So that's what a devil
[9:15] means. A demon is a human possessed with
[9:20] a lying spirit.
[9:23] It comes from the Greek don which
[9:26] actually means demigod or someone with
[9:28] some kind of weird power on them. Not
[9:32] superheroes and stuff. That's fiction,
[9:34] right? Young people, little children,
[9:37] they don't exist,
[9:39] &gt;&gt; right? So, first let's look at our
[9:41] modern life and discover what role truth
[9:45] plays. You love him.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I felt inspired to speak on
[9:50] this which was triggered by the
[9:52] discussion we were having at the
[9:54] brother's meeting brother's fellowship
[9:56] on communication which led then to a
[9:59] very healthy discussion on the brother's
[10:01] WhatsApp group which led to questions on
[10:03] why truth is so hard to be accepted. We
[10:08] all want it but when it is told to you
[10:11] you can't accept it. Right.
[10:13] &gt;&gt; One of the topics of discussion was that
[10:15] we find it so frustrating because we
[10:18] know people can see the truth even that
[10:22] we don't fully comprehend but we know
[10:24] people know the truth but they won't
[10:27] accept it.
[10:29] It's as if if you see the truth, why
[10:32] can't you just accept it? Right? And or
[10:37] we know that we have told the sincere
[10:39] truth to someone and yet they will
[10:41] always think something bad or a
[10:44] nefarious of us though we have told them
[10:47] the truth.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; So what the questions are is it lack of
[10:51] maturity on their part? Are you with me?
[10:56] &gt;&gt; So I I know you go through this all the
[10:57] time. If you're married, you're going
[10:59] through it,
[11:01] right? You fall in love, you're so
[11:04] infatuated with each other, then you get
[11:07] married, you put the ring on each
[11:08] other's finger, and then you test each
[11:10] other for the rest of your lives and
[11:11] whether you tell each other the truth
[11:12] every day.
[11:14] And it's the silliest things
[11:17] are like, did you really put your
[11:19] clothes in the wash basket? Tell the
[11:22] truth. This is how petty it becomes.
[11:25] Imagine young people before you get
[11:27] married just know this is the purpose of
[11:28] marriage. You marry so you can test each
[11:30] other on the truth for the rest of your
[11:32] life.
[11:37] Did you think it was about dates and
[11:39] romance? No, it's not. It's about
[11:41] testing each other on the truth.
[11:45] And you made promises AT THE ALTAR WITH
[11:47] ALL THESE VOWS AND EVERYTHING. I'M GOING
[11:48] TO LOVE YOU. I'M GOING TO DIE FOR YOU.
[11:50] I'm going to do all that. And then but
[11:52] in the fine print is I'm going to test
[11:53] you on the truth for the rest of our
[11:55] lives.
[11:57] And then when you tell the truth it's
[11:59] like yeah you know maybe okay
[12:04] we'll agree to disagree.
[12:07] So what what does it mean to tell the
[12:11] truth? And when we tell the truth how
[12:14] how do we get people to believe us? Why
[12:16] do people not believe us? Are we not
[12:18] convincing enough?
[12:20] Do you have to be convincing for the
[12:22] truth to be believed? Because then it's
[12:24] not really truth, right? Because if you
[12:27] really have to convince someone, it
[12:28] means you're adding stuff in like
[12:31] manipulation and extra evidence and
[12:33] witnesses.
[12:36] THE BABY SAW ME PUT THE CLOTHES in the
[12:38] wash basket,
[12:42] right? I mean, shouldn't people be more
[12:45] mature enough to accept truth even if
[12:48] the tone it was delivered in was not the
[12:50] best? Well, I don't know if it's the
[12:52] truth because you didn't really say it
[12:53] in a nice way.
[12:57] Like, isn't the truth the truth
[13:00] independent of the tone it was spoken in
[13:03] or the way it was written or the the
[13:07] punctuation in the sentence?
[13:11] As Yeah. Oh, who said it? As believers,
[13:16] we know that God's prophets were never
[13:19] accused of having the best tone.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; They just came and told you what for,
[13:26] right? There was they didn't come there
[13:28] and think about your feelings.
[13:31] You know, like I think of Nathan when he
[13:33] came to David and he said he gave him
[13:35] this whole story about this lamb that
[13:37] was taken away and killed and was stolen
[13:39] from this guy and he riled David up to
[13:42] be angry to to tell him what are you
[13:44] thinking? Well, I think that man should
[13:46] be. And he said, you the guy,
[13:49] &gt;&gt; you know, if I had to do that to you,
[13:51] you'll be like, you know, you should
[13:52] have considered my feelings
[13:54] &gt;&gt; before correcting me in this manner and
[13:56] in front of people, you came and gave me
[13:59] a parable AND TRAPPED ME. THAT WAS
[14:01] ENTRAMENT. THAT'S WHAT you would tell
[14:02] me.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; So, these prophets
[14:06] didn't bother with tone or choice of
[14:08] words or punctuation or timing. They
[14:12] came when God told them and they said
[14:14] what they said and you had to deal with
[14:15] it. Right? As believers, we know this in
[14:20] the message. We now have preachers and
[14:23] ministers. I'm talking about our
[14:25] churches.
[14:27] WE HAVE PREACHERS and ministers who
[14:29] write off other ministers
[14:32] because they don't speak what they do or
[14:35] how they do or because they don't say
[14:38] exactly what the prophet said word for
[14:42] word or because they don't keep the same
[14:45] cood conduct order and doctrine OR
[14:48] BECAUSE THEIR doctrine is different.
[14:51] You know what's the most amazing thing
[14:53] about the Lord Jesus Christ? You know
[14:55] Jesus wasn't a Christian, right?
[14:59] He was a Jew.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; News flash.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; And you know when he uh spoke and when
[15:07] you know what his church was full of
[15:10] Pharisees, Sadducees, publicans,
[15:14] is that right?
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; And uh he didn't uh accumulate only the
[15:20] same people to him.
[15:23] He spoke to a completely mixed
[15:24] multitude. He went to a Samaritan woman
[15:27] who the Jews had already cast out
[15:31] &gt;&gt; and pulled her. In other words, Jesus
[15:34] who began Christianity who was a Jew
[15:38] or born in into the Jewish uh culture,
[15:43] right? He was God himself, of course. Uh
[15:46] but he had all kinds of people who
[15:49] followed him. They were not of one type
[15:52] of speech. They were not not one type of
[15:54] race. They were not one type of culture.
[15:57] They were not only one type of
[15:58] following.
[16:00] AND HE CRITICIZED EVERYONE equally
[16:04] &gt;&gt; and called people from all walks of
[16:07] life. Imagine if he had to be like how
[16:10] we are today, agreeing with only certain
[16:13] people or attracting only a certain
[16:16] group of people and shunning all other
[16:18] kinds of people, then you're not doing
[16:20] what Christ did. Right?
[16:23] &gt;&gt; So that kind of behavior when you do
[16:25] that, when you write off people, when
[16:28] you demonize people is a kind of
[16:31] behavior that indicates that your that
[16:34] the truth has been compromised to you.
[16:36] Mhm.
[16:37] &gt;&gt; You believe in Christianity. You're
[16:39] reading from the Bible, but it's been
[16:41] compromised to you. If you can write off
[16:44] people,
[16:46] you are not presenting the truth the way
[16:48] it should be.
[16:50] You might be in possession of the truth,
[16:53] but it's compromised and it's causing
[16:56] weird behavior on you. And that's what
[17:00] we we want to kind of show you this
[17:01] morning that you might actually have had
[17:04] the truth delivered to you, but it's
[17:07] been compromised.
[17:09] So that's what we want to explore.
[17:10] People don't have to accept the truth.
[17:13] Like you don't have to come and say to
[17:15] me, "Brother Al, I believe what you're
[17:17] saying." And then why are you telling me
[17:20] that? Why is it important for me to know
[17:22] that you believe? It's not important.
[17:25] You don't even have to say I believe for
[17:28] you to believe
[17:30] &gt;&gt; because your actions in your life says
[17:32] what you believe.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; So what people say is one thing or shake
[17:37] your hands and agree with you on one
[17:39] thing but the way they live thereafter
[17:41] is proof of what they believe. You see?
[17:44] So there are some people you can tell
[17:47] them the truth and they'll say no look I
[17:49] understand what you're saying. I agree
[17:50] with what you're saying but I need to go
[17:52] to my own church and you know that's
[17:54] fine. They don't even have to say they
[17:56] agree or they don't agree. But
[17:58] thereafter, after you've told them the
[17:59] truth, if they live by it, they've
[18:01] accepted it.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Even if they're not in the same church
[18:04] as you.
[18:07] All right. So, let's get to this great
[18:09] important point. Truth is now a
[18:12] phenomenon.
[18:14] Truth is like as rare as a qua.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; What? You guys don't know what's a qua?
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[18:25] That's how rare it is,
[18:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[18:29] So, it's it's um it's become something
[18:32] that um is so hard to find.
[18:37] It's so hard to see because we've been
[18:41] living our entire lives with lies
[18:43] everywhere. Right? Okay. So, I want us
[18:47] all to concentrate on something. I want
[18:50] us to be so clear about this. So
[18:53] understand this so you don't get trapped
[18:55] into it like everybody else.
[18:58] The word truth never existed
[19:02] for such a long time. For the big deal
[19:04] that we make about it today, it never
[19:06] existed for thousands of years. The word
[19:09] truth, think about it. Well, for one,
[19:12] the the English word truth only came up
[19:14] when English was invented, which was
[19:16] only in the last 2,000 years. So before
[19:19] that, WHAT WAS IT CALLED?
[19:23] OKAY. So that's just words and the words
[19:27] that were used when it was first forming
[19:30] were different words that meant
[19:33] faithful,
[19:35] firmness,
[19:36] strength.
[19:38] in in the Hebrew it's em right which
[19:42] which means like strength or firmness or
[19:45] something reliable or something stable
[19:48] or something that is assured and all
[19:51] that em is is linked to the word
[19:54] covenant
[19:56] there was no word called truth
[20:00] though Cain told the first lie
[20:04] that wasn't much reason for humans to
[20:06] lie thereafter because after that Adam
[20:08] lived and then Seth lived and then they
[20:10] were bringing forth children and they
[20:13] had cattle and they had all the fruit
[20:15] they could eat. They had stuff they they
[20:17] were planting everywhere. There was no
[20:19] world trade. There was no uh um uh
[20:23] global system like now. There was no
[20:25] businesses set up like like there is
[20:26] today. There's no constitution. There's
[20:28] no law of the country. There's no reason
[20:30] for anyone to lie.
[20:34] So Cain was the first liar. But nobody
[20:37] went around asking each other, "Are you
[20:39] telling the truth right now?" Are you
[20:41] with me?
[20:42] &gt;&gt; So covenants,
[20:45] covenants are like contracts.
[20:48] Contracts or covenants only became a
[20:50] thing to hold people accountable to what
[20:54] they promised you. So if a guy, we're
[20:56] talking about 4,000 years ago, a guy
[20:58] comes to you and says, "Listen, because
[21:00] you gave me this grain, I promise you
[21:02] I'm when the time when lambs are born,
[21:04] I'm going to give you seven lambs for
[21:06] the amount of grain that you give me."
[21:08] How how do I know you'll keep your word?
[21:10] Let's make a covenant. What's the
[21:11] covenant? In a in a presence of a few
[21:13] witnesses,
[21:15] uh we write something up on a scroll. We
[21:18] sign it somehow with our seal with wax
[21:20] or whatever it is. There's our covenant
[21:22] is kept by a judge. The judge is at the
[21:24] gate. We've made a covenant. When the
[21:26] lambs are born, you keep your covenant.
[21:29] That was called truth. The covenant
[21:32] itself was called truth.
[21:35] Are you with me?
[21:37] &gt;&gt; That's where it comes from. So the idea
[21:40] of truth only came in a lot after Adam,
[21:44] a long time after Adam when covenants
[21:47] were made to confirm promises.
[21:51] RIGHT? SO COVENANTS became a thing to
[21:53] hold people accountable to their word
[21:55] and to inspire loyalty.
[21:59] When man was first created, when the
[22:00] first humans walked the earth, there was
[22:03] no quest to find truth. There was no men
[22:06] around that time asking, "Does God
[22:08] really exist?
[22:10] Is the earth really so many years old?"
[22:14] Uh what about the Big Bang theory? No
[22:18] man ASKED THOSE QUESTIONS FOR THOUSANDS
[22:20] OF YEARS.
[22:21] NOBODY WALKED AROUND ASKING, "WELL, what
[22:24] is the scientific evidence for God?
[22:28] That's only a modern thing." Are you
[22:31] with me?
[22:32] &gt;&gt; They didn't need proof for God. They or
[22:35] the proof that God created the universe.
[22:37] It was an ACCEPTED THING FOR THOUSANDS
[22:40] OF years that God created the universe.
[22:42] God created the earth.
[22:46] And it remained that way for about 5,000
[22:49] or more years. Are you with me? So
[22:52] people lived simply by what they saw and
[22:56] what they took from off the earth. And
[22:58] there was no need to seek truth for any
[23:02] reason.
[23:04] Are you with me?
[23:06] &gt;&gt; How did we get trapped into this
[23:08] conundrum today where every it's so
[23:11] stressful,
[23:13] right? Is there any day in your life
[23:16] that you are not fighting about some
[23:18] truth?
[23:19] You have some problem with Vodiccom.
[23:21] You're fighting about truth,
[23:24] right? Some with Edgars at the pavilion
[23:27] or something went wrong with a tag or
[23:29] some piece of cloth. I'm trying to make
[23:30] it the simplest thing you could ever
[23:32] think of. Or you go and order food after
[23:35] the service and there's a an issue with
[23:37] truth. Did they really make the food the
[23:40] way they're supposed to make it? Did
[23:41] they keep their promise? Every day is so
[23:45] stressful.
[23:48] Um, back then nobody spoke or demanded
[23:52] truth about God or life on earth. Nobody
[23:56] asked about whether we came from
[23:57] Neanderthalss or whether we evolved from
[24:00] monkeys or spoke about oralopythecus
[24:05] or anything. Nobody asked about whether
[24:07] there was singular cell organisms.
[24:09] NOBODY ASKED FOR THAT FOR THOUSANDS OF
[24:12] YEARS.
[24:14] Then at some point in man's existence,
[24:17] people started to lie more frequently
[24:20] than ever before and it began as a new
[24:24] type of behavior in people. It then
[24:26] required action from people to search
[24:29] for truth. In other words, PEOPLE ONLY
[24:31] NEEDED TO SEARCH FOR truth when lying
[24:33] became a big thing.
[24:36] Why did lying begin? All right, this is
[24:39] very simple.
[24:41] Lying began because of trade.
[24:46] Right? So, what will happen is I promise
[24:49] to give if you you're a baker, you give
[24:51] me bread, I give you milk because I own
[24:54] cows. So, what I'll do is I'll put in
[24:56] like less than the amount of milk I'm
[24:58] supposed to give you. So, I'm trading
[25:00] with you, but I'm promising you I'm
[25:01] giving you the right thing. And then you
[25:04] check in and you find out, hey, listen,
[25:05] this guy has like a false bottom ON HIS
[25:07] JAR. HE'S not giving me the right amount
[25:09] of milk. AND THEN YOU GO BACK. This is
[25:11] how it began. Because why trade is
[25:14] something we like to monopolize over? We
[25:18] want to get the better deal.
[25:22] Do you know why you fight every day? Cuz
[25:24] you always want the better deal.
[25:27] Yeah.
[25:29] Like what do you get from accusing your
[25:31] husband for not putting the clothes in
[25:33] the in the wash basket?
[25:35] What do you get from it? That you were
[25:38] right. Well done.
[25:43] That's what you got. No price. You're
[25:46] not going to get a hug from him. That's
[25:47] for sure. But any man, if you emasculate
[25:50] him or make him feel less than he is,
[25:52] he's not going to feel like hugging you
[25:53] for the next week.
[25:56] And vice versa, brothers. Proving that
[25:59] your wife did something wrong or said
[26:01] something, what do you get from it? What
[26:02] do you get from fighting for the truth?
[26:06] Nothing. If if you get proven right, all
[26:10] you can do is for a few moments bask in
[26:12] the glory that you were right.
[26:16] THAT'S ALL. And then she hates you for
[26:18] the next week
[26:20] because you just couldn't be a a
[26:23] sacrificial lamb to take one for the
[26:25] team. You had to go and prove that you
[26:27] were right. That's all you get.
[26:32] So I would say from observing human
[26:34] behavior that lying to one another must
[26:36] have first started when humans decided
[26:39] to trade for survival. I think people in
[26:43] desperation are forced to lie and then
[26:47] very often you have people who
[26:49] eventually like lying so they lie all
[26:52] the time. If you remember the prophet
[26:54] said there was that little boy there was
[26:57] there was a man uh who when he was a boy
[27:01] his mom asked him he's remember he
[27:03] smoked in the barn or something and then
[27:05] he went and tried to grind up coffee
[27:07] beans or uh to take away the smell of
[27:11] the smoke from his uh from his breath
[27:14] and he's I mean come on that's the
[27:16] stupidest thing to do right because who
[27:19] eats coffee beans you come into the
[27:21] house smelling like coffee beans things
[27:23] in your mouth and your mom knows you did
[27:24] something. So he's disguising and his
[27:27] mom asked him, "Did you just smoke?"
[27:30] "No, MOM, I DIDN'T SMOKE. SMELL MY
[27:32] BREATH." OF COURSE, HIS MOTHER smells
[27:34] the coffee and knows something is wrong.
[27:36] She doesn't smell coffee. She smells a
[27:38] rat,
[27:40] right? And then the prophet said a
[27:42] simple thing like that. uh he lied there
[27:46] and then he lied again to cover up that
[27:48] lie and then he lied again to cover up
[27:50] that lie that he covered up the other
[27:52] one with and then he kept doing that for
[27:54] the rest of his life. Prophet said until
[27:56] the time where he's an adult and he
[27:58] cannot speak without lying
[28:03] &gt;&gt; because that's what happens. Okay, let's
[28:04] read this scripture. Deuteronomy 13. So
[28:07] this is now,500
[28:09] years or more after Adam. This is the
[28:11] time of Moses. And Moses says, "Certain
[28:14] men, the children of Biliel.
[28:17] Biliel is a name you will find congruent
[28:19] with everything to do with lies in the
[28:22] Bible." Like when uh Ahab had those two
[28:25] sons of Bil who lied about Nabbath. Like
[28:29] when Christ, you had those two sons of
[28:31] Bil who lied that Christ had said this
[28:33] about the Roman government.
[28:36] Bil is is tied together with liars,
[28:40] right? teaching you some of your Bible.
[28:42] So certain men, the children of Beiel,
[28:44] are gone out from among you and have
[28:46] withdrawn the inhabitants of the city,
[28:48] saying, "Let us go and serve other gods
[28:50] which you have not known. Then shalt
[28:53] thou inquire and make search and ask
[28:55] diligently, and behold, if it be truth,
[28:58] and the things certain." Now, I want you
[29:00] to notice those words. You must now
[29:02] inquire. You must make search and ask
[29:05] diligently. You wouldn't have to search
[29:08] for truth unless there was a lie. Can
[29:11] you see it? Behold, if it be truth, and
[29:14] the thing certain that such abomination
[29:16] is wrought among you, thou shalt surely
[29:19] smite the inhabitants of that city with
[29:21] the edge of the sword, destroying it
[29:23] utterly, and all that is therein, and
[29:25] the cattle thereof with the edge of the
[29:28] sword. All right? So in the Bible, sons
[29:31] of Biliel are liars. So we can see there
[29:34] that investigations, searching,
[29:36] diligently seeking only occurs if there
[29:40] are lies. Otherwise, there's no reason
[29:41] to go around looking for it. Right?
[29:44] Societies then began to live with
[29:47] constant lies around them and it caused
[29:50] the world to live under a behavior of
[29:52] fear. Because when people lie to you, it
[29:55] something takes over you and they they
[29:57] make you afraid. They put doubt in you.
[30:00] They put superstition in you to find
[30:03] truth, right? Uh and after 6,000 years
[30:07] in this world of lies, after 6,000
[30:09] years, we've been living in this world
[30:11] of lies, right? Truth is now a
[30:15] phenomenon that can only be seen if the
[30:19] lies are uncovered.
[30:22] I'm saying prior to lies, what were we
[30:26] seeing then? Can you imagine? Maybe they
[30:27] were different colors. I don't know.
[30:30] Hm. The world must have looked terribly
[30:32] or beautifully different
[30:34] um without what we see today.
[30:39] I don't mean literally, okay? I mean
[30:43] people must have been more relaxed. They
[30:45] must have had longer life. They must
[30:48] have been happier. They must have uh not
[30:51] sherked hard work. They must have looked
[30:54] forward to getting up in the morning and
[30:56] getting out there and digging the ground
[30:58] and planting. They must have looked
[31:00] forward to getting their hands stuck in
[31:02] the dirt. You know, most of you are now
[31:05] you have tactile problems. You can't
[31:07] touch mud. You can't touch dirt. You
[31:09] can't touch squiggly things. You can't
[31:11] touch oily things. You can't get messed
[31:13] in water. You hate all kinds of weird uh
[31:16] you get freaked out when you see a
[31:18] little squirmy worm or a mouse or a
[31:21] cockroach or something. You just like
[31:24] have heart palpitations and almost die
[31:26] and have to be resuscitated when you see
[31:28] some small little creature.
[31:32] What happened? There used to be in the
[31:34] things that you saw.
[31:36] Lies has a has a very negative effect on
[31:40] life.
[31:43] And it produces doubt, fear and
[31:46] superstition. So for that to happen, for
[31:50] us to see this phenomenon called truth,
[31:54] you first have to uncover the lie. Is
[31:57] that right? Which makes us all
[31:59] unqualified detectives.
[32:02] See, coming back to that wash basket and
[32:05] clothes, you now have to go and search
[32:08] for clues to prove he was lying.
[32:12] so that you can bask in the glory of
[32:14] being right.
[32:18] Am I right? So all of you brothers,
[32:22] sisters, children, young people, that's
[32:25] all you get from proving that you told
[32:27] the truth.
[32:29] The Bible says, "Walk in the light. Let
[32:32] your yay be yay. Let your nay be nay."
[32:34] If you live openly and honestly before
[32:36] people, no one has to be a detective
[32:39] with you. They just believe you. Oh,
[32:42] that guy will never tell lies. He always
[32:44] tells the truth. He He's always open
[32:46] about his feelings and his expressions
[32:47] and all that. You never have to be a
[32:49] detective around him. You can be
[32:51] comfortable with him. YOU KNOW EXACTLY
[32:53] WHAT HE THINKS. That's what Christ said.
[32:55] YOU DON'T HAVE TO SIGN ANY CONTRACTS OR
[32:58] MAKE ANY covenants if your yay is yay
[33:00] and your nay is nay.
[33:03] But somehow the other, you've been duped
[33:06] into feeling that you have to protect
[33:08] yourself. You have to protect your your
[33:10] your intentions, your feelings. You have
[33:13] to protect it. When you do that, you
[33:16] start to live with lies and you get
[33:18] comfortable with untruths and deceit,
[33:21] right? It's very stressful.
[33:24] So once we have recognized now when when
[33:27] the lies have been uncovered spiritually
[33:30] and mysteriously, it is a personal
[33:32] experience. Like for example with the
[33:34] opening of the seals
[33:37] today, that's where we got to head to
[33:38] eventually, right?
[33:41] Uh the opening of the seventh seal, it's
[33:43] a personal experience, right? And to
[33:46] have the human ability to recognize lies
[33:50] is on the seals is impossible. God is to
[33:53] DO SOMETHING AND BREAK open those lies.
[33:57] And when we break open the lies, you see
[33:59] something. You see the truth. AND THE
[34:02] BUT THE FIRST THING THAT YOU SEE IS WHAT
[34:04] the lie was.
[34:06] Amen. Once we have recognized that there
[34:09] is something present today that has
[34:11] exposed all the lies of the devil, we
[34:14] then focus on the effects of living with
[34:17] lies and what it has on our minds and
[34:20] our families and our homes and our
[34:23] society. Are you with me saints? Truth
[34:28] is the salvation of an already poisoned
[34:32] mind and spirit.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Because if you receive the truth, it
[34:38] sets you free.
[34:40] &gt;&gt; Your mind has already been poisoned by
[34:43] lies constantly. And the truth sets you
[34:46] free from that. If you think, well, I
[34:49] can do what I want. I'm free in this
[34:51] life. I'm not in a cage. You're already
[34:53] in a cage in your mind.
[34:56] Only truth, and here's the amazing
[34:58] thing. We all know this, only truth has
[35:02] the ability to penetrate that mind and
[35:04] release you.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Only that truth gives you the feeling
[35:09] like, "Oh, okay. I get it now. I see
[35:13] that." And you immediately see the
[35:15] effect on a person. Their shoulders
[35:17] drop. They don't, oh, at last, finally.
[35:22] Right? You get that feeling.
[35:25] Yeah, here's something. Truth of the
[35:28] past is still truth, but it's become
[35:32] tainted by those who passed it on to us.
[35:35] That means that Irenius from way back,
[35:40] St. Austinon of Hippo, uh, Jerome, all
[35:43] those great founding fathers of the
[35:45] first church, Martin Luther, John
[35:48] Wesley, Calvin Knox, all these great men
[35:51] of Christianity
[35:53] in their day, they spoke truth that was
[35:56] revealed to them by the Holy Spirit. But
[35:58] then when men passed it on, they added
[36:01] stuff to it
[36:03] and then eventually concealed the truth.
[36:06] Like you remember what we did with uh I
[36:09] showed you you know you you have this
[36:11] this uh kids party game called broken
[36:13] telephone. I told you about this when we
[36:15] preached seven seal and you put 20 kids
[36:18] in a circle on chairs and you whisper
[36:21] something in the first kid's ear
[36:24] right and uh you tell him now you
[36:26] whisper it in the other ear. By the time
[36:29] you get to the 20th kid, it's not even
[36:31] what you told the first kid
[36:36] because each child is going to interpret
[36:38] what they heard. And it depends how they
[36:41] speak, what language they have, what uh
[36:44] what grammar they use or how they
[36:47] whisper it or whether the words were
[36:49] unclear. Literally, you try it. Go try
[36:52] it as a psychological game for one of
[36:53] your kids party. You can have fun, too,
[36:55] at kids parties. See? can trap these
[36:58] little guys and figure it out and then
[37:01] you can ask them why did you tell this
[37:02] one? What did you tell this one? Then
[37:04] you find the real guy who corrupted the
[37:05] whole story, right? It's amazing. But
[37:10] anyway, this is Can you imagine the
[37:12] original truth of Jesus Christ being
[37:15] passed down 2,000 years to what we have
[37:18] today?
[37:20] And look at the difference between
[37:22] churches. Look at the difference between
[37:24] Christ and these disciples who worked
[37:26] among the poor who didn't care about
[37:28] money and flashy churches and big
[37:30] screens and great music and and uh
[37:33] conglomerations of multi-million dollar
[37:36] and now we have this 2,000 years later
[37:39] we have these churches these
[37:41] multi-million dollar institutions based
[37:44] on that poor Nazerite
[37:46] and we say praise the Lord.
[37:51] You know, this is the this is the the
[37:53] shame
[37:55] that I see today. You have beautiful
[37:59] church buildings
[38:01] uh
[38:03] uh beautiful chapels and and and
[38:07] cathedrals and all kinds of things and
[38:10] you've just got poor people around not
[38:12] being fed.
[38:14] They have millions. They have all the
[38:16] money. They could clothe the unclothed.
[38:19] They could feed the beggars. They could
[38:22] uh they're supposed to be there. They've
[38:24] got these wonderful buildings. They
[38:26] could be counseling the drunken,
[38:28] counseling the broken marriages and not
[38:31] it's not even open most of the week.
[38:33] It's open for like half an hour on
[38:36] Sunday or I don't know 1 hour and that's
[38:39] it. That's Christianity.
[38:46] The truth of the past is truth, but it's
[38:48] been tainted by who passed it on. So
[38:51] it's critically important that truth for
[38:54] the present day is presented and has to
[38:57] be established.
[38:59] So what is the truth for your day? It
[39:02] must be presented as it is given and it
[39:04] must be established right now. Fear is
[39:09] an influence that creates
[39:11] fifthdimensional doubt. In other words,
[39:14] doubt which comes from hell. Fear does
[39:17] that to you. Right? And fear will hinder
[39:20] the power of truth. If you receive
[39:23] truth, truth gives you power to act.
[39:26] Right? I'm going to start telling you
[39:28] that now. And u but when you have fear,
[39:32] you it makes the truth powerless to you.
[39:35] You're afraid to act. you're afraid to
[39:37] to take it and be active with the truth.
[39:40] Living with negativity and negative
[39:42] thoughts causes you to follow a specific
[39:44] path in life. And living with positivity
[39:47] and positive thoughts causes another
[39:49] life. If you the same person are grown
[39:52] up with lies, you'll choose a different
[39:54] path. Same person grown up with truth
[39:56] and positivity, you'll choose another
[39:58] path. Diametrically opposite,
[40:01] right? Okay. Where's all my bright young
[40:05] scholars and university students and
[40:07] young professionals? Where are you?
[40:09] Okay, some of you listening and online
[40:12] this morning, we're going to talk about
[40:14] objective and subjective truth. How many
[40:17] of you older people know nothing what I
[40:19] just said?
[40:23] They don't want to raise their hand.
[40:25] OBJECTIVE TRUTH AND SUBJECTIVE TRUTH.
[40:28] MOM, do you know what that is?
[40:30] &gt;&gt; No idea. See, she's honest.
[40:32] Think of how our young people deal with
[40:35] life today. Okay, for those of you
[40:38] parents don't know this, they drum this
[40:41] into your kids at schools and
[40:42] universities. At high school level and
[40:45] university level, you are taught what is
[40:47] objective truth and subjective truth,
[40:50] right? And it's indoctrination
[40:52] because these kids come out with
[40:54] objective truth and subjective truth and
[40:56] do not know what truth is, right? So
[41:01] young people today and I have had
[41:02] conversations with them. I was telling
[41:04] my sons on the way here, they want
[41:07] evidence.
[41:10] They believe if they get the evidence
[41:12] then they've got the truth. They think
[41:14] that if you have evidence then you have
[41:16] truth.
[41:18] What what we realized then in our
[41:21] discussion was the our our discussion
[41:24] with the brothers in the week was the
[41:26] misunderstanding of what truth really
[41:29] is. Now today they have an idea that the
[41:32] actual truth is called objective truth.
[41:35] Are you listening? Okay. So now the
[41:37] older people are going to get educated
[41:38] too. They your young people believe the
[41:41] real truth is called objective truth.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[41:46] And uh that which is not really truth is
[41:50] subjective truth. Like I would just say
[41:52] lies.
[41:55] But they've got subjective truth. That's
[41:56] where they end up into you have your
[41:59] truth. I have my truth. We both have
[42:02] truth.
[42:03] I'm like you both are crazy.
[42:09] Deceived.
[42:11] The wool has BEEN PULLED OVER YOUR EYES.
[42:13] But okay. Anyway, objective truth. Okay.
[42:16] So, what I did was I thought, well, let
[42:19] me give them the benefit of the doubt. I
[42:21] went into my phone and I typed in
[42:24] objective truth and subjective truth and
[42:26] I went to the what is it? Google Gemini
[42:30] Copilot AI genius,
[42:33] right? And so, this is what I got,
[42:37] right? It says the definition, and I'm
[42:40] paraphrasing because it writes too long.
[42:42] Objective truths are facts that exist
[42:45] independently of individual opinion or
[42:49] beliefs. So that's basically already
[42:52] sorting you out.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; It's like uh your opinion and your
[42:56] beliefs are not really truth.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Objective truth is something that is
[43:03] derived from facts.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Right. And they're so happy with facts.
[43:09] Who gave you THOSE FACTS? SOMEONE ELSE
[43:12] WITH OPINIONS.
[43:15] Never mind.
[43:17] They are universally
[43:20] right. Universally accepted and can be
[43:22] verified. Who verifies it? Never mind.
[43:26] Through observation, measurement or
[43:28] empirical evidence. Right? For example,
[43:32] this is what my phone gave me. The
[43:34] statement water boils at 100° C at sea
[43:37] level is an objective truth that remains
[43:41] constant regardless of personal beliefs.
[43:43] THAT MEANS WHETHER you believe it, you
[43:46] know, if you believe it boils at 70° or
[43:48] you believe at 50 or you believe at 98,
[43:51] it's not the truth. The objective truth
[43:54] is it boils at 100° C. So we tested it
[43:58] coming here. My son's phone said to him,
[44:00] the earth is round. That's an objective
[44:02] truth.
[44:05] 2+ 2 is four. That's an objective truth,
[44:09] right? My question is, does water really
[44:13] boil at 100° C?
[44:17] &gt;&gt; No, not really.
[44:21] And as you go higher at different
[44:23] altitudes, it boils it less.
[44:27] And if you don't have absolutely pure
[44:29] water and exactly the right atmospheric
[44:33] pressure, it does not boil at 100° C. So
[44:36] how is that an objective truth? It's an
[44:39] overall objective truth because it works
[44:41] for us to uh make other calculations in
[44:44] life because it works for us. You all
[44:47] have to accept it. So all of you are
[44:48] like this donkey with a carrot being
[44:51] dangled in front of your nose that water
[44:54] boils at 100° C because it works for us.
[44:57] We must all accept it.
[45:00] The earth is round.
[45:02] How many of you when you drive on the
[45:04] earth you just drive like this?
[45:08] No, you drive like
[45:11] which means only round from a distance.
[45:14] But when you get closer, what shape is
[45:16] it?
[45:18] And what if it stops spinning?
[45:21] Because when you spin something, it
[45:22] starts to look round, right? You can
[45:25] take a square thing and spin it really
[45:26] fast and it starts looking round. But if
[45:28] it stops spinning, is it really round?
[45:32] So how is it an objective truth? Because
[45:34] the masses agree it's an objective
[45:37] truth. And someone with credentials,
[45:39] with links and sources
[45:42] told us
[45:45] that's our brainwashed children of
[45:47] today.
[45:49] Subjective truth, right? Definition. I'm
[45:51] picking on them for a good reason. Uh uh
[45:54] the definition of subjective truth. Now,
[45:56] that's what they're going to tell you.
[45:58] What I'm saying to you to you parents
[46:00] today. You know, you have these kids,
[46:02] you don't even know. You don't even
[46:03] check their textbooks and what they are
[46:05] indoctrinated with. And then you try and
[46:07] argue with them about the word of God.
[46:09] And if they ask you for a link or a
[46:11] source, you're in trouble. You're in
[46:13] deep water. Right?
[46:16] Uh my mother would say, "What are you
[46:18] talking about links and sources? That's
[46:20] just demons."
[46:22] Right? That's what she would have told
[46:24] me if I asked that. Subjective truths
[46:27] are based on personal beliefs, feelings,
[46:29] and interpretations.
[46:31] Like for example uh instead of saying
[46:36] uh um or or it's like you like something
[46:40] or something is good good enough to you
[46:42] or you think this is the best thing
[46:44] that's like subjective because it's your
[46:47] truth you experience it so um that's the
[46:50] truth to you but to me it might be
[46:51] different right um subjective truth they
[46:55] can vary from person to person and are
[46:57] often influenced by individual
[46:58] experiences and context for instance One
[47:01] person may find a particular piece of
[47:03] music beautiful while another may not.
[47:07] Right?
[47:08] So I'm sure all students in university
[47:12] will insist
[47:15] this concept of objective truth and
[47:17] subjective truth is the truth.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; So why are they calling it truth?
[47:25] Why are they calling objective truth?
[47:27] Why are they using the word truth in
[47:29] there? Who made them use the word truth
[47:31] in it? Why don't they call it objective
[47:34] knowledge and subjective knowledge?
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Why say truth
[47:39] when nobody knows what truth is?
[47:43] If you said objective knowledge and
[47:45] subjective knowledge, I'll agree WITH
[47:47] YOU.
[47:48] BUT YOU SAID TRUTH.
[47:51] That's where I have a problem.
[47:54] See, they don't think deeply enough.
[47:56] This is a modern-day concept using
[47:59] ancient words. Who gave you the right to
[48:02] decide what an ancient word should mean
[48:04] today?
[48:06] You never made up the word truth? YOU
[48:10] DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM.
[48:15] How can how can subjective truth even be
[48:18] a thing? How can it be that your
[48:21] experience that you have could actually
[48:23] even be called a truth? What do you mean
[48:26] by that? It's a knowledge. It's not
[48:29] truth.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; IT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT that water
[48:33] boils at 100° C. That's what they will
[48:37] tell you. Right? Many years ago, they
[48:40] had scientific PROOF THAT THE EARTH WAS
[48:43] FLAT.
[48:47] All right? And today the earth is round.
[48:51] And yet we have a whole group of people
[48:54] in the earth today who they call
[48:56] flatearthers
[48:59] &gt;&gt; who believe the with all the evidence
[49:01] with all the pictures. There's even
[49:04] people who believe that space is fake.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; They're there. What I'm asking you is if
[49:11] the truth is something that when it is
[49:13] spoken is believed, how do we still have
[49:16] flatearthers with ALL THE EVIDENCE?
[49:20] WHY is it that WHEN YOU PRESENT ALL THE
[49:23] KNOWLEDGE, all the evidence, YOU STILL,
[49:25] THE MORE EVIDENCE YOU BRING, the more
[49:27] flatearthers you get,
[49:31] right? That's kind of like the conundrum
[49:32] we were talking about on the brother's
[49:34] fellowship group. Why do people no
[49:36] matter how much how nicely you speak,
[49:39] how how uh um uh kind you are, gentle
[49:42] you are, how how well you EXPRESS
[49:45] YOURSELF, HOW GOOD with the perfect
[49:47] English you can articulate yourself. Uh
[49:49] yet they still will not believe. It's
[49:51] like you can you can GIVE THEM THE
[49:53] PERFECT evidence and they won't believe
[49:54] it.
[49:56] Why will people still not believe facts
[49:59] today? Why will people not trust facts
[50:04] today? And some of you can sit there and
[50:06] say, "BUT YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[50:08] I TOLD YOU THE TRUTH." AND THEN you're
[50:10] the same person will not believe when
[50:12] someone else tells you.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; Claiming facts, young people, listen up.
[50:19] CLAIMING FACTS AS truth creates an
[50:23] illusion of truth that brings nothing
[50:28] to life at all. It's like what I told
[50:30] you about, you know, your husband and
[50:33] wife and you prove to them what the
[50:34] truth is. What do you get? Nothing.
[50:37] Nothing but heartache and probably some
[50:39] frustration for a few days. YOU GET
[50:42] NOTHING. YOU ACTUALLY GET NOTHING FROM
[50:44] FACTS.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Except knowledge.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; That's all you get. Knowledge.
[50:51] But truth is very different from
[50:53] knowledge.
[50:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Because you can live by truth. You don't
[50:58] live by knowledge.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; IT ACTUALLY MAKES A PERSON WHEN YOU
[51:03] PRESENT FACTS like my my son there, we
[51:07] we call him fun facts at home because at
[51:10] random times he gives us facts we don't
[51:12] care about and we have to waste 5
[51:15] minutes of life just listening to all
[51:16] these facts and he won't stop. He'll
[51:17] he'll spill IT ALL OUT. FUN FACT. WE'LL
[51:20] BE DRIVING SOMEWHERE and he'll tell us
[51:21] facts about if I ask him right now to
[51:23] give you a random fact right now, he'll
[51:25] give you like
[51:26] one after the other. Good for him.
[51:30] It actually makes a person you can get
[51:33] fascinated and and the only thing is you
[51:35] listen to this fun fact and you say,
[51:36] "Wow,
[51:38] really? I didn't know that. Five minutes
[51:41] later, I forgot everything you said."
[51:44] That's all that's what happened with the
[51:46] facts. Do you know this? It's like
[51:48] reading something from a chappies bubble
[51:50] gum thing. Did you know blah blah blah?
[51:53] You know, some people remember that.
[51:55] Most people forget everything. We
[51:58] concentrate more on chewing the gum and
[51:59] the flavor, right? So, go back to daily
[52:03] life and you FORGET ALL THE FACTS YOU
[52:06] CAN THINK OF. Whatever someone gave you,
[52:08] all the information I gave you, it's
[52:10] useless unless you can actually use it.
[52:13] Right? Now, here's the fallacy about
[52:16] facts and reliable sources. I wonder if
[52:19] I put that in. Yeah,
[52:22] fallacy about facts and reliable
[52:24] sources. So, if you have if you have the
[52:28] inconvenient,
[52:30] undesirable experience of having a
[52:33] debate with a young person today.
[52:37] You are going to often hear this
[52:40] statement. Can you provide a link for
[52:42] the claim you made? Or can you name a
[52:46] reliable source for your claim? And then
[52:49] if you do name something, they have like
[52:52] a attack and they say that has
[52:54] been debunked.
[52:57] It's crazy.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; It's like they're another kind of
[53:00] creature. It's they get so affected by
[53:02] you selling something that has been
[53:04] debunked. Some of you here don't even
[53:06] know what debunked means. I can see
[53:08] that. That doesn't mean the bunk bed was
[53:10] broken.
[53:14] If you f So a fact that has been
[53:17] disproved they call debunked,
[53:20] right?
[53:21] &gt;&gt; AND UH SO FACTS in reliable sources,
[53:23] internet links and people with relevant
[53:27] credentials. Now here's another thing.
[53:29] If you did not study the subject, if you
[53:31] don't have a degree in the subject or a
[53:33] PhD, then you are not qualified to speak
[53:36] about. Have you heard that? I can't tell
[53:38] what is a woman because I'm not a
[53:40] biologist.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; I can't tell it's a dog because I'm not
[53:48] a biologist.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Right? Can you believe that? This is
[53:53] where we ARE TODAY BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE
[53:55] CREDENTIALS,
[53:57] so the highest biologists in the world,
[54:00] so can you imagine? I'd love this. Have
[54:02] all these biologists. One has a
[54:04] bachelor's degree, one has a PhD. So,
[54:06] which means the PhD guy can tell more
[54:09] what a woman is than the the one with a
[54:12] bachelor's degree. And the higher they
[54:14] get, the the more credentials they have
[54:16] to tell what it is. LIKE, YOU CAN'T
[54:20] believe your lying eyes. You need
[54:22] someone with credentials TO TELL YOU
[54:24] WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW.
[54:30] Like that guy doesn't know what's a
[54:32] woman. That therefore is not married.
[54:36] Like what's his problem? He's got a
[54:38] degree. He's got money. He's got a car.
[54:39] He's a handsome guy, but he can't get
[54:41] married.
[54:43] Most likely he can't tell what a woman
[54:44] is.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; I don't understand.
[54:49] See, evidence, young people, brings
[54:54] knowledge, not truth.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Facts, reliable sources, internet links,
[54:59] and people with relevant credentials is
[55:02] a trap. So let me bring you back to this
[55:05] point and this is what I told you when I
[55:07] was when we were talking about
[55:08] marriages. If you have to investigate
[55:13] the girl that you are attracted to and
[55:17] find out everything you can about her,
[55:19] you will not marry her.
[55:24] You will not
[55:26] you you cannot. Cuz after you find out
[55:28] everything there is to know about
[55:29] someone, they'll stop being attractive
[55:31] to you.
[55:33] This is why love does not need evidence.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Because truth is actually based on
[55:42] belief.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; If you HAVE TO GO AND ASK SOMEONE WHAT
[55:46] DID YOU DO? What do you like? What is
[55:48] this about you? Oh, present everything
[55:50] before them. Uh do you like this color?
[55:53] Do you like that color? Do you like
[55:54] this? Like when do you know? When do you
[55:57] have enough evidence to make the
[55:59] decision to marry that person?
[56:03] You know, you bring her home to your
[56:05] mother and your mother's going to ask
[56:06] you that. How do you know she's the
[56:08] what?
[56:10] What are you going to do then? Pull out
[56:11] proofs, evidence, links, reliable
[56:14] sources,
[56:17] you hypocrites.
[56:20] I KNOW, MOM. I KNOW. SHE'S THE ONE FOR
[56:22] ME.
[56:25] Evidence brings knowledge, not truth.
[56:28] The Bible says, "Knowledge puffth up.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Charity edifth."
[56:35] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Charity never faileth,
[56:37] but where there is knowledge, it fadeth
[56:40] away."
[56:43] If you think a 32-year-old professor who
[56:48] rose recently to stardom through social
[56:51] media and fame for spitting out
[56:54] amazingly recently discovered findings
[56:58] is an authority on the existence of
[57:00] earth and whether GOD EXISTS AS COMPARED
[57:05] WITH 6,000 years of man's witness.
[57:11] with people GIVING US THE WORD OF GOD,
[57:13] then it's very troubling.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; If you can believe some 32-y old
[57:17] professor who's got a degree on
[57:20] paleontology and earth and whatever else
[57:24] other degrees he think he's an expert on
[57:27] whether God exists,
[57:30] that's very concerning
[57:32] because all you have is knowledge that
[57:34] faith way. AMEN. THE TRAP is if you
[57:38] place faith in facts and reliable
[57:41] sources and people with credentials, you
[57:43] fall into the trap. Listen up carefully,
[57:46] you fall into the trap of not being able
[57:49] to discern
[57:51] for yourself and to trust your own
[57:54] instincts. Amen.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; THE MORE YOU LIVE ON FACTS, the less
[57:58] instincts you have,
[58:00] &gt;&gt; the more doubt you have because you're
[58:03] going to rely on sources and people and
[58:06] what their opinions are. The most
[58:09] stressed person is a person who cannot
[58:12] discern. Like when you're you're looking
[58:14] at something, something is presented and
[58:16] you can't tell whether it's the truth or
[58:17] not. Yourself, you can't tell that it's
[58:20] the truth. Why can't you tell? Why do
[58:23] you need facts? Why do you need links
[58:25] and sources?
[58:27] Are you with me?
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Over time, this is what will happen.
[58:31] Young people, your instincts become very
[58:34] weak and unreliable. I'm telling you
[58:36] what's happening. All your grandmothers
[58:39] and grandfathers, they married when they
[58:41] were 19 and 20 or even younger. Did they
[58:44] stress about I don't have a job. How
[58:48] will we make it? How will we pay the
[58:50] bills? They didn't. They got married and
[58:53] said, "Let's figure it out."
[58:55] You,
[58:57] if someone said, "Let's figure it out."
[58:59] You'll have a hernia and you'll be
[59:00] admitted to the nearest hospital in the
[59:02] week
[59:03] &gt;&gt; and you'll have people all around tell
[59:04] you, "WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? How could
[59:07] YOU GET MARRIED? YOU'RE SO YOUNG. YOU
[59:08] HAVEN'T EXPERIENCED LIFE YET." RIGHT?
[59:11] And then what's going to happen? You're
[59:12] going to decide to get married when
[59:14] you're 42 years old or something or
[59:16] you're way older. Is that right? That's
[59:19] when you say, "Okay, now I think I'm
[59:21] ready. I've experienced life." You don't
[59:24] know what you're talking about. When you
[59:27] live to 40 and you've already been
[59:29] comfortable with this is how my house
[59:31] is. This is how my life is. This is my
[59:33] peace on the weekends. And you get
[59:36] married to someone who's questioning
[59:37] your peace.
[59:39] And then you get a toddler WHO'S
[59:41] BREAKING AND SHATTERING every piece of
[59:44] silence that you held as golden.
[59:48] you're making a mistake. Seeing
[59:52] today, people's instincts are being
[59:54] stripped away and um more emphasis is
[59:59] being placed on what the media says.
[1:00:02] Like that to me, it's so crazy to see so
[1:00:06] many young people indoctrinated by the
[1:00:09] media. Like we've lived for years and
[1:00:11] realized you can't trust the media.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And these young people are
[1:00:15] trusting everything they see online,
[1:00:18] what the the media tells them. I I don't
[1:00:20] understand that
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; you won't trust the Bible, but you'll
[1:00:24] trust the media.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; Right? And why? Because it's reliable
[1:00:29] sources. Now, are you all awake?
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; I mean, spiritually awake. I want you to
[1:00:34] see what's happening around the world.
[1:00:36] Have you seen around the world a
[1:00:39] populist movement rising?
[1:00:42] What is populist movement? What is a
[1:00:44] populist movement? We've had for very
[1:00:47] many years we've had these conservatives
[1:00:48] and these liberals on either side in
[1:00:51] government and they're ruling our
[1:00:52] governments. But recently there's a
[1:00:55] populism movement. What is that?
[1:00:58] Populism is something that arises when
[1:01:01] ordinary people in the country feel like
[1:01:03] they've been abused by the elite ruling
[1:01:06] class.
[1:01:09] And the first THING THAT HAPPENS WITH A
[1:01:11] POPULIST movement is don't trust the
[1:01:13] media. They're lying for the rich.
[1:01:16] They're lying FOR THE ELITE. THAT'S
[1:01:19] HAPPENING EVERYWHERE. That took over
[1:01:20] America. That's how Donald Trump got
[1:01:22] elected by populism. That's now
[1:01:25] happening in in Germany and Italy and
[1:01:27] France and places that used to be ruled
[1:01:30] by these elites. THE THE POOR ARE RISING
[1:01:33] UP.
[1:01:36] You know what? the the elite, we call
[1:01:38] them the 1%, you know, the billionaires,
[1:01:40] the millionaires, the the very rich. You
[1:01:42] know what they don't realize? There are
[1:01:44] millions of poor people. If all the
[1:01:47] millions of poor people stood up at once
[1:01:49] and walked, they walk right over them.
[1:01:55] That's the truth.
[1:01:57] And what's been happening, the millions
[1:01:59] of people have been lied to by those who
[1:02:04] are monopolizing the world for their own
[1:02:08] benefit.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; The millions are being used. You are
[1:02:11] being used as workers. You are being
[1:02:13] used. You've been abused. YOU'VE BEEN
[1:02:15] TOLD YOU CAN GET FREE MEDICAL, free
[1:02:17] education, free this, free that. And
[1:02:19] then they they pull it out of you. AND
[1:02:22] THE PEOPLE ARE NOW REALIZING we can't
[1:02:23] trust the leaders. And the media lies
[1:02:26] for them. The internet lies for them.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Right? Even AI,
[1:02:36] even the
[1:02:38] artificial intelligence is like
[1:02:41] programmed with elitist ideas.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. So that if you ask them a question,
[1:02:46] it's going to tell you most likely today
[1:02:48] from a liberal point of VIEW OR THE YOU
[1:02:52] ACTUALLY HAVE a a a robot telling you I
[1:02:55] can't comment on this because
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; like the robot has a soul. It doesn't,
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; but it's answering from someone else's
[1:03:04] point of view.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So when populist
[1:03:08] movements rise they say that immediately
[1:03:12] the media is fake news. So what happened
[1:03:16] THE MOMENT THE POPULIST MOVEMENT said
[1:03:18] fake news the media came out and said
[1:03:21] disinformation misinformation.
[1:03:24] You heard that right? They came up with
[1:03:27] new words. In other words they brought
[1:03:29] this to the forefront. Objective truth
[1:03:33] subjective truth. The media started
[1:03:35] saying we have the objective truth. They
[1:03:38] are speaking subjective truth. And now
[1:03:41] the world is fighting about it. Who has
[1:03:44] the truth? All sides are saying they
[1:03:47] have subjective truths. The other one
[1:03:49] this side says the other side have
[1:03:51] subjective truth and that side is saying
[1:03:52] this of this side. So both sides, right?
[1:03:56] They all have listen are you all with
[1:03:58] me? In your government you have these
[1:04:01] two parties that are fighting against
[1:04:02] each other. This side has links,
[1:04:06] sources, facts, and people with
[1:04:08] credentials. This side has links,
[1:04:11] sources, facts, and people with
[1:04:12] credentials.
[1:04:15] Who has the truth there?
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Because they both have this exact need.
[1:04:21] They have evidence. They have facts to
[1:04:23] back the claim. And neither one believes
[1:04:26] the other.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; So, who has the truth then? Which is the
[1:04:31] truth? They don't have the truth.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; They have knowledge.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; And then they have these professors
[1:04:41] debunking those professors and those
[1:04:44] professors debunking these professors.
[1:04:46] Now, I'm just giving you a platform
[1:04:48] because when I bring you to the message,
[1:04:52] we're going to have this side and this
[1:04:54] side.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; And this one saw the pillar of fire and
[1:04:57] that one saw the PILLAR OF FIRE. THIS
[1:04:59] ONE HAD A DREAM. THAT ONE HAD A DREAM.
[1:05:01] THIS ONE HAD AN ANGEL VISIT HIM. This
[1:05:03] one had an angel visit him. THIS ONE HAS
[1:05:05] A PROPHET. THAT ONE HAS A PROPHET. THIS
[1:05:07] ONE HAS AN APOSTLE. THIS ONE HAS AN
[1:05:09] APOSTLE.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; What do they have? Knowledge.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Who has the truth?
[1:05:16] My title is sons of God will find the
[1:05:20] truth.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; So whenever the arguments break down and
[1:05:25] one of the their credible now here's
[1:05:28] what happens, right? This is amazing to
[1:05:30] me because once you reach a stalemate,
[1:05:33] this one have facts, this one has facts,
[1:05:35] this one has knowledge, this and the
[1:05:36] knowledge reaches a stalemate,
[1:05:39] then the only thing they can do is
[1:05:42] discredit one on a moral basis. In other
[1:05:45] words, find some scandal to discredit
[1:05:48] his knowledge.
[1:05:50] Suddenly, they become righteous and find
[1:05:53] something wrong in this one's marriage
[1:05:54] or this one slept with that person or
[1:05:57] this one made a money deal. What are we
[1:05:59] doing? We're discrediting the person to
[1:06:02] discredit the knowledge.
[1:06:07] We don't mind smearing their lives in
[1:06:09] the newspaper, smearing the lives of
[1:06:11] social media. What's the intention? To
[1:06:15] squash the knowledge so you get power
[1:06:18] IRRESPECTIVE OF HOW YOU DAMAGE the
[1:06:21] person and the family and their
[1:06:23] children.
[1:06:26] This is always the case. When facts and
[1:06:28] sources and information and knowledge
[1:06:30] breaks down, the next step is attack the
[1:06:33] person.
[1:06:36] That's a problem that already tells like
[1:06:38] when we get to that situation, I don't
[1:06:40] even want to talk to you.
[1:06:43] There's no reason. If you the moment you
[1:06:45] start attacking my character, you
[1:06:47] attacking my my person, my family, my
[1:06:50] children, my church, you start attacking
[1:06:53] people, I already know your argument has
[1:06:55] failed. Cuz if you actually have truth,
[1:06:58] you won't need to attack a person.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Like Christ said, why won't you believe
[1:07:06] me for my work's sake?
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; What do they have? When they couldn't
[1:07:11] answer him, they went to, "You were born
[1:07:13] of that Mary who you say was a virgin?
[1:07:16] Aren't you the son of the carpenter?"
[1:07:20] What's that got to do with anything?
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Did he say the truth or not? Did he do
[1:07:26] the works of God or not? What has it got
[1:07:28] to do with where he CAME FROM OR WHAT
[1:07:30] HIS LIFE WAS?
[1:07:33] SEE, so now what we have people, you
[1:07:36] have this populist movement in the world
[1:07:38] right now. two sides. The beast rising
[1:07:41] out of the sea, the beast rising out of
[1:07:42] the earth. You have these two sides and
[1:07:44] there is a serious vacuum in the world
[1:07:47] for truth.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a space cuz all we
[1:07:51] have is knowledge on either side.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; This is causing people right now, right
[1:07:57] now, people all over the world want to
[1:07:59] trust their instincts again.
[1:08:02] After spending decades of listening to
[1:08:04] lies, now you want to trust your
[1:08:06] instincts. Now you have Christians
[1:08:08] rising up everywhere who want to fight
[1:08:10] against abortion and fight against
[1:08:12] transgenderism and fight against
[1:08:13] homosexuality and fight against uh
[1:08:16] adultery and fight against this and that
[1:08:18] and now just they the populist movement
[1:08:20] is giving them a voice to now suddenly
[1:08:22] come out and stand for Christianity
[1:08:25] and you stand for something you make a
[1:08:27] stand against one thing and there's
[1:08:29] other things you're not standing for
[1:08:31] like you you go on social media and
[1:08:34] fight for Christianity while using
[1:08:36] f-word words
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; and you don't know the Bible tells you
[1:08:42] Christ says you are not tainted by what
[1:08:45] you put in by what comes out
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; what comes out of your mouth poisons you
[1:08:50] kills you
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; how can you speak God's name and rubbish
[1:08:54] at the same time
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; filthy words in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:08:59] with the same mouth praise him with the
[1:09:02] same mouth curse and swear
[1:09:05] how do you do that they do it and they
[1:09:09] look righteous in each other's eyes.
[1:09:13] They're all the same.
[1:09:15] Don't believe a word they say.
[1:09:18] This is causing So right now you have
[1:09:20] all these people I I pity them all
[1:09:22] around the world trying to be follow
[1:09:25] this populist movement and come out as
[1:09:28] if they are truth tellers. It's too
[1:09:30] late.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; It's too late. You can't trust your
[1:09:33] instincts anymore. your instincts have
[1:09:35] been destroyed. The the first attractive
[1:09:39] speaker they give you, when I say
[1:09:41] attractive, the guy who says the right
[1:09:43] thing, pushes the right buttons, you're
[1:09:45] going to fall for him and then you're
[1:09:47] going to follow him. You're not
[1:09:48] interested in truth. You're interested
[1:09:50] in power.
[1:09:52] You want to be the winning side to rule
[1:09:54] the government, to rule the people
[1:09:57] because you THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH FACTS
[1:09:59] TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR the people and to
[1:10:02] make the people like you.
[1:10:04] Your instincts have been destroyed.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; It's the same thing Christianity. You
[1:10:10] get the first attractive speaker who can
[1:10:13] convince you, give you the best music,
[1:10:16] give you the best looking church, give
[1:10:18] you exactly what you want, doesn't call
[1:10:20] out your sin, lets you live how you want
[1:10:22] to, let you make you make you love him,
[1:10:25] and then he sleeps with your wife
[1:10:32] and you say, "Oh." Oh, and then he comes
[1:10:33] out with his lovely voice. You know, I
[1:10:35] slipped up. I made a mistake. But we're
[1:10:39] all sinners.
[1:10:42] And then you just elect him BACK IN TO
[1:10:44] BE A PASTOR.
[1:10:47] This is it. The problem is all people
[1:10:51] who choose one of two sides defined by
[1:10:54] the enemy of mankind and they don't even
[1:10:57] know it. Where is it going? It's heading
[1:11:00] all the way back to the beast. It's
[1:11:01] going to establish the man of sin.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; So saints, for us, aligning our thoughts
[1:11:08] to the truth produces
[1:11:11] finding God, which invites more of the
[1:11:14] Holy Spirit in. Amen. You don't need to
[1:11:17] have all the knowledge,
[1:11:20] right? If you try to live in the past
[1:11:23] truth which is tainted, just because you
[1:11:26] think your church was founded a,600
[1:11:29] years ago or 500 years ago doesn't mean
[1:11:32] anything. Just because your church was
[1:11:35] founded by some great founding father
[1:11:38] doesn't mean anything. What? Where is
[1:11:41] that supposed to be? Some credentials.
[1:11:44] It's like the Zoroastrians saying our
[1:11:46] religion is 5,000 years old. What's that
[1:11:49] supposed to mean? Just because you're so
[1:11:52] old makes you right.
[1:11:57] You could have been back then already
[1:12:00] believing what is wrong and you carried
[1:12:03] it for 5,000 years. You poor thing.
[1:12:08] Don't even get into arguments like that.
[1:12:10] Right? It's not worth it. Truth must be
[1:12:13] seen.
[1:12:15] Right? Keeping our thoughts centered on
[1:12:18] present day truth allows us to see
[1:12:21] present day events. Have faith for
[1:12:23] present day tri. You know you have you
[1:12:27] believers do not realize how
[1:12:30] fortunate you are because you have been
[1:12:32] shown what is a white horse rider, a red
[1:12:35] horse rider, a black horse rider, pale
[1:12:36] horse rider because it's been revealed
[1:12:39] to you what that is. When you see one,
[1:12:41] you know it.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; When you see a religious spirit, you
[1:12:44] know it.
[1:12:45] YOU CAN TELL WHEN A PREACHER is lying to
[1:12:47] you. Why? Because the truth has been
[1:12:50] unveiled to you.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And you sit there and YOU CAN LISTEN TO
[1:12:53] OTHER PREACHERS TOTALLY SWAYING the
[1:12:56] crowd.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; And the other the people are raising
[1:12:59] their hands, sincere people believing in
[1:13:02] the Holy Spirit, raising their HANDS.
[1:13:03] AND THE GUY IS SAYING, "You need to give
[1:13:05] me more money because the one day I got
[1:13:09] no money IN TO PUT PETROL IN MY TANK.
[1:13:13] AND WHEN YOU'RE SICK, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:13:15] NEED ME. HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:18] And the poor people. Yes, let's give
[1:13:19] money.
[1:13:21] And he takes your money and goes on
[1:13:23] holiday with it.
[1:13:26] What? You used the Holy Ghost, the
[1:13:28] religion, the anointing, and got people
[1:13:31] to give you money, and the PEOPLE DO NOT
[1:13:34] SEE IT.
[1:13:39] This is why the Bible starts with in the
[1:13:42] armor of God, gird your loins with
[1:13:45] truth.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; And the Bible speaks of the loins being
[1:13:48] the mind. It's where the seed of the
[1:13:51] word is first received where it is
[1:13:53] conceived and produces a life. Guide
[1:13:57] good.
[1:13:58] Protect your mind with truth.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's bring us to the
[1:14:05] mysterious effects of truth. Now here's
[1:14:08] something here. It's a phenomenon. This
[1:14:10] is why I love it. It's a phenomenon. You
[1:14:13] can have facts and therefore you possess
[1:14:16] knowledge. Right? But if you have are
[1:14:19] you listening?
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; If you possess facts, you possess
[1:14:24] knowledge. BUT IF YOU HAVE found truth,
[1:14:28] it possesses you.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Big difference.
[1:14:33] Truth possesses you.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; There is no person to whom truth is
[1:14:39] revealed who just sits and does nothing
[1:14:41] with it.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; Right ladies, you know, right? If you
[1:14:46] get the scoop, you're just going to sit
[1:14:47] there and say, "I'll just keep the scoop
[1:14:48] to myself.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; No way. You're on the phone in 5
[1:14:52] minutes. I HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE. I HAVE
[1:14:55] TO DO SOMETHING. I'VE BEEN TOLD THE
[1:14:56] TRUTH ABOUT THIS SCANDAL. I HAVE TO
[1:14:58] SHARE IT."
[1:15:00] NOBODY SITS with the truth and does
[1:15:01] nothing and keeps it buried. The truth
[1:15:04] produces a reaction.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; I just use a very humorous example.
[1:15:11] There is no person to whom a truth is
[1:15:13] revealed who does nothing. Truth is so
[1:15:15] powerful that it forces human reactions.
[1:15:18] Right? Uh use any example in life. If
[1:15:22] you suddenly receive the truth about
[1:15:23] something, it causes you to just blast
[1:15:25] it open and tell everybody. Right?
[1:15:28] Because you feel a strange moral
[1:15:30] responsibility that you have found
[1:15:32] truth. Like for example, somebody did
[1:15:35] something bad to your friend and you
[1:15:38] found out what happened about it. Are
[1:15:41] you not going to tell your friend? No.
[1:15:43] You feel you'll talk to your husband or
[1:15:45] your wife. What must I do? I have to
[1:15:47] tell them. Yes. But if they tell them,
[1:15:49] they are not going to be friends with
[1:15:50] us. But I have to. It's the truth.
[1:15:53] And if you don't, you know, you're not
[1:15:55] going to sleep. You're not going to eat
[1:15:57] po
[1:15:59] you. Your life is going to be stressed.
[1:16:01] You're not going to work properly. Your
[1:16:03] bowels are not going to work properly.
[1:16:04] You're going to be constipated
[1:16:06] just from holding the truth.
[1:16:10] Right? You know that stress. This is
[1:16:12] exactly what happens to human be. You
[1:16:14] might even burst out an ulcer
[1:16:17] just from not telling the truth.
[1:16:20] Listen people, if you're let's say one
[1:16:23] of your young children, like if you have
[1:16:25] uh you have if you're unlucky to have
[1:16:28] more than two kids, right?
[1:16:34] When they're together,
[1:16:37] my goodness, you ask them who did this?
[1:16:44] He did it. He did. He did. And then when
[1:16:46] the one you'll then you start hearing
[1:16:48] how each one is telling you their facts,
[1:16:50] right? And then they have to start
[1:16:52] proving who told the truth. I see
[1:16:54] brother Claude is smiling,
[1:16:57] right?
[1:16:59] AND THEN YOU HAVE, YOU now are the
[1:17:01] judge. You have to find out. You know
[1:17:03] what you end up with parents? Which one
[1:17:05] of your kids is the better liar? It's
[1:17:07] not a good revelation to find out.
[1:17:10] That's what you end up with. You wish
[1:17:12] Listen, just tell me the truth so I
[1:17:13] don't think bad of you.
[1:17:15] Anyway, if if if a child knows the
[1:17:19] truth, this it's unbelievable. They
[1:17:22] become rats immediately. THEY RUN TO
[1:17:23] YOU, "DADDY, HE DID THIS. YOU TOLD US
[1:17:25] NOT TO DO THIS, BUT I SAW HIM DID THIS."
[1:17:27] And then they stand there waiting for
[1:17:28] you to judge them,
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; right? They can't help it because if the
[1:17:33] if they see the truth, they have a
[1:17:36] compulsion to say it. The human
[1:17:38] reaction.
[1:17:41] If so, if you're a child and you learn a
[1:17:43] truth, what makes you better in your
[1:17:45] parents' eyes but to tell them the truth
[1:17:47] and you stand there beaming,
[1:17:50] right? Chest out beaming. I told them
[1:17:52] the truth.
[1:17:54] Uh it's like with my kids and they used
[1:17:57] to come to me and and tell me, "Daddy, I
[1:17:59] did this wrong. You told us to tell you
[1:18:01] the truth. Thank you. You're grounded
[1:18:02] for two weeks. BUT I TOLD YOU THE
[1:18:04] TRUTH." YEAH, but you still did a wrong
[1:18:07] thing. You have to pay for it.
[1:18:09] The truth has to be acted on. Thank you
[1:18:12] for telling me the truth. You're such a
[1:18:13] good person for telling me the truth,
[1:18:15] but you did a wrong thing. So, you're
[1:18:16] grounded.
[1:18:18] See, if you're a teenager or you're an
[1:18:21] adult or an older person and if you find
[1:18:24] the truth, you're going to do the same
[1:18:26] thing. You're going to tell a friend to
[1:18:29] make you look good. You're going to tell
[1:18:31] a friend to save a friend. You're going
[1:18:33] to tell a friend. You're going to tell
[1:18:34] whoever it is because you want the truth
[1:18:36] to start acting. But if you just got
[1:18:39] facts,
[1:18:40] nah,
[1:18:42] right? Just facts.
[1:18:45] You can keep it to yourself. You can you
[1:18:47] don't even get stressed about facts.
[1:18:50] All a fact will do is well, so I was
[1:18:54] kind of right. That's about all you get
[1:18:56] from it. It can cause some of you, the
[1:18:59] truth can cause some of you to act upon
[1:19:01] it without thinking. You will broadcast
[1:19:04] the truth without realizing its after
[1:19:06] effects. And some people will
[1:19:08] immediately love you if you expo if if
[1:19:11] what you expose helps them, they'll love
[1:19:13] you. If what you expose u exposes them,
[1:19:17] they'll hate you.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; So the truth will produce reactions of
[1:19:21] all kinds.
[1:19:23] Right? On the other hand, if you receive
[1:19:25] truth and if you decide to deny the
[1:19:27] truth, reject the truth and not act on
[1:19:30] it and not live by it, it's going to
[1:19:32] cause other human reactions which will
[1:19:34] involve lying, living deceitfully,
[1:19:38] covering up, staying away from certain
[1:19:40] people, avoiding confrontations, and
[1:19:42] eventually a breakdown of life leading
[1:19:45] to an even worse shattering showdown of
[1:19:48] truth and lies.
[1:19:52] That was just a mouthful to say.
[1:19:55] Imagine what it's like in real life.
[1:19:57] You're You know what I mean? If you live
[1:20:00] with lies, like I feel so sorry for
[1:20:03] people who say, "I can't say.
[1:20:08] I I I know, but I can't say. I can't say
[1:20:11] it to you right now. I I'm not ready to
[1:20:13] speak to you right. I'm not like I can
[1:20:16] see a human struggle. I can see a soul
[1:20:18] struggling right there. Right. I I have
[1:20:20] so much of pity for people who just
[1:20:22] can't get it out. Like tell me what's on
[1:20:25] your mind. I'm not going to get hurt.
[1:20:27] I'm not going to throw you away. Just
[1:20:29] say what you want to say. Right? Your
[1:20:33] dilemma comes about the right time. So
[1:20:36] So here's your what your struggle is. I
[1:20:38] want to know the right time to tell the
[1:20:41] truth. Why? WHY DO YOU NEED THE RIGHT
[1:20:43] TIME TO tell the truth? Because you want
[1:20:45] the most favorable outcome for you.
[1:20:50] Is that right? You want the perfect
[1:20:52] outcome. That's the way we manipulate
[1:20:55] truth. Why can't truth just be spoken as
[1:20:57] soon as it's found out?
[1:20:59] No, we that's that's the way we deal
[1:21:01] with it because we want the right
[1:21:04] outcome and that's what people do. Okay.
[1:21:07] So, I want to get through this quickly
[1:21:08] because we are already into time. God
[1:21:12] identifying himself by his
[1:21:13] characteristics. So and I he says I I
[1:21:16] believe God will come to any good man in
[1:21:18] some way and identify his doings to that
[1:21:20] good man for that age if that man is
[1:21:22] called of God for that age. But it was
[1:21:24] so unusual they just could not hardly
[1:21:26] grasp it. Which means when God brings
[1:21:28] the truth to you the TRUTH IS ALWAYS SO
[1:21:30] unusual in every age. It's hard to grasp
[1:21:33] it because it's only unusual BECAUSE OF
[1:21:36] THE LIES YOU'VE been living with. Right?
[1:21:38] And then if you go on, he says the
[1:21:41] characteristics is is God's word being
[1:21:44] identified by the characteristic of
[1:21:47] what's going on. Right? I'm going to
[1:21:49] move through it quickly. If you look
[1:21:51] through it and and paragraph 70 now,
[1:21:54] always every time corrects the word um
[1:21:56] when the word is said wrong. So
[1:22:01] go read it home. If a certain truth is
[1:22:04] being covered by lies, then somebody has
[1:22:07] to bring the truth of the lies
[1:22:10] first.
[1:22:12] Okay, how do I do this? Okay, let's say
[1:22:15] this is the truth, right? And it's been
[1:22:18] covered by a lie. The you're never going
[1:22:21] to see what THE TRUTH IS UNTIL YOU FIRST
[1:22:23] tell the truth about the lie.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Got it? So when you tell the truth about
[1:22:28] the lie, then you expose the lies. Then
[1:22:31] you see the truth that the lie was
[1:22:32] hiding.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN GOING TO GET TO there
[1:22:36] unless you open this out.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; THAT'S LIKE WHAT THE seven seals were.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; CLOSING THE BOOK. AND WHEN THE SEALS ARE
[1:22:44] OPEN, you go have a party about the
[1:22:47] seals, but there's still this.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; See? So we'll EXPLAIN THIS WAY. IF
[1:22:53] someone committed a crime, are you going
[1:22:56] to love this now? Cuz everyone likes a
[1:22:58] good crime. But they covered up the
[1:23:01] crime expertly and carefully constructed
[1:23:03] lies. They paid people off for
[1:23:05] testimonies in court. They they
[1:23:08] presented evidence as truth, which means
[1:23:10] they even tainted the evidence, right?
[1:23:13] And the evidences produced as truth were
[1:23:15] PRESENTED TO THE JUDGE, PRESENTED to the
[1:23:17] jury. And because of that and the
[1:23:19] witnesses and the alibis who were also
[1:23:22] paid off, they corroborated it. The
[1:23:24] person is set free. You're not a
[1:23:27] criminal. You are free to go. But then
[1:23:31] an investigator
[1:23:33] who wants to find the truth has to go
[1:23:36] investigate the lies first.
[1:23:39] How is he going to know those are lies
[1:23:41] unless he senses something is being
[1:23:44] covered up?
[1:23:46] Are you with me? Which means people are
[1:23:49] never going to accept the evidences if
[1:23:52] they sound like a cover up.
[1:23:55] Something in a human is sensing
[1:23:58] that person when they testified, when
[1:24:00] they confess that something wrong,
[1:24:01] something's missing. LIKE YOU'RE NOT
[1:24:04] EVEN A PROFESSOR, BUT you can tell this
[1:24:06] person is not something is wrong. Are
[1:24:08] you with me?
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; That sense in the investigator is going
[1:24:12] to say, "I want to follow that trail. I
[1:24:14] want to go check that testimony. I want
[1:24:16] to check on that person's life. I want
[1:24:17] to investigate. So what happens is
[1:24:20] because the lies were accepted as truth,
[1:24:22] the investigator goes and he checks up
[1:24:24] the cover up. And he goes and looks at
[1:24:27] all the submitted statements and the
[1:24:30] confessions and the evidence. Well, the
[1:24:33] there was blood or there was
[1:24:34] fingerprints or there was a hair
[1:24:35] follicle or there was something some
[1:24:37] forensic test. Who signed the forensic
[1:24:39] documents? Who was the pathologist? Who
[1:24:42] was, you know, who is this? Who is that?
[1:24:44] You can tell I've read a lot of crime
[1:24:45] stories. And only um can new statement
[1:24:50] and evidences and confessions be
[1:24:52] submitted as truths. Cuz after you have
[1:24:54] uncovered the lies, you now need new
[1:24:57] witnesses, new statements, new
[1:25:00] confessions, new evidences. Are you with
[1:25:03] me? TO PRESENT THE ACTUAL TRUTH.
[1:25:07] So usually God has to send us another
[1:25:12] truth.
[1:25:14] in every day to undo the lie
[1:25:19] of the previous age.
[1:25:21] See, and it's so unusual.
[1:25:24] That's why people reject it. It's not
[1:25:26] believed immediately. Most people think,
[1:25:30] oh, 100 years later, oh, he was right
[1:25:34] when he said this. And at that time,
[1:25:36] they told us it was a lie. Right?
[1:25:39] So then what he's saying here is the
[1:25:42] word of truth is still not believed.
[1:25:44] That's what he's saying. Until certain
[1:25:47] characteristics are produced in
[1:25:50] believers and they are manifested. Those
[1:25:53] believers are the ones who investigate
[1:25:56] to be the proof of the truth. That means
[1:26:00] the only way you're going to find the
[1:26:01] truth in the day is that there's some
[1:26:04] character in believers
[1:26:06] to search for the truth.
[1:26:09] to not believe what they've been told,
[1:26:11] what they've BEEN PREACHED AT.
[1:26:13] OTHERWISE, THE PUBLIC WILL NEVER FIND
[1:26:15] IT.
[1:26:16] RIGHT? And what does the word do? The
[1:26:18] word corrects the error. Spoken word
[1:26:21] corrects the error. The point is, if it
[1:26:23] really is truth, you can't help it. It's
[1:26:26] going to produce something mysterious in
[1:26:27] you. What are we saying, saints? The
[1:26:29] mysterious reactions, the mysterious
[1:26:32] effects of truth is when truth is
[1:26:34] presented, it's going to put something
[1:26:36] into a certain group of people who are
[1:26:39] going to sense the lie and make them
[1:26:41] search for the truth. That's what's
[1:26:43] going to happen. Are you with us? Let's
[1:26:45] go to the next one. Truth causes people
[1:26:48] to sherk responsibility.
[1:26:50] So, at first, after living in lies all
[1:26:53] your life, truth has a way of causing us
[1:26:56] to feel like we're too exposed, right?
[1:26:59] They open us up. They they publicized
[1:27:01] us. And it's not it's going to take too
[1:27:03] much work to achieve our purpose. So, we
[1:27:05] push it away for another day.
[1:27:08] Right? Listen people,
[1:27:12] I can tell you some truth straight off
[1:27:14] the bat.
[1:27:16] We will reduce crime in our country if
[1:27:19] we ban alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs.
[1:27:24] will eliminate 90% of crime.
[1:27:28] Because if you have men in our country
[1:27:31] who are suffering from unemployment,
[1:27:34] being belittled by the government, and
[1:27:36] the government is producing intoxicants,
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; for them to consume day in and day out,
[1:27:43] you are going to produce criminals.
[1:27:48] &gt;&gt; It's logical.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Why won't they do it? because they need
[1:27:52] poor men.
[1:27:54] Because poor men are going to DO THE
[1:27:56] JOBS NOBODY ELSE DOES.
[1:28:00] Poor men are going to do the jobs nobody
[1:28:02] else wants to do. The people living in
[1:28:05] plush homes with air conditioning and
[1:28:06] driving Rolls-Royces, they don't want to
[1:28:08] dig and lay fiber.
[1:28:11] They don't want to go and PUT UP
[1:28:12] DRYWALL. THEY DON'T WANT TO GO dig in
[1:28:14] the septic tanks
[1:28:17] and the sewage. They they need poor men
[1:28:20] who are on drugs to do that
[1:28:23] and they will keep doing that. They've
[1:28:25] done it for years.
[1:28:29] But there's a truth. Why won't they do
[1:28:31] it? Cuz it works for them.
[1:28:36] It's so easy, right? It's easy when the
[1:28:39] responsibilities fake us face us to
[1:28:42] shook from them. So if you tell people
[1:28:44] the truth, the first reaction is shook
[1:28:46] from it because hey, hold on. Life has
[1:28:49] been working for me right now. If I do
[1:28:51] this, it's going to complicate my life.
[1:28:53] So paragraph 51, this is hard to say.
[1:28:56] And now we bring it to us ministers.
[1:28:59] It's true that ministers many times
[1:29:02] sherk a responsibility for standing for
[1:29:05] the true word of God when they're
[1:29:06] confronted with it. If anything, you
[1:29:09] should have churches speaking out
[1:29:11] against sin.
[1:29:14] And today, because we want money, we
[1:29:17] sherk the responsibility.
[1:29:20] It's not stopping.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; They'll sherk that responsibility. When
[1:29:25] truth of the word of God is brought face
[1:29:28] to face with we humans, we are prone to
[1:29:30] sherk back until the last resource. THAT
[1:29:33] MEANS WHEN YOU'VE TRIED EVERYTHING, WHEN
[1:29:35] EVERYTHING has failed, then you decide,
[1:29:37] okay, now I want to speak the truth.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; By then you've hurt so many people.
[1:29:44] You're accountable.
[1:29:46] Sometimes saints, it's because the truth
[1:29:49] is criticism. And that's why we sherk it
[1:29:53] because we don't like challenges. We
[1:29:54] don't like to be criticized. When we are
[1:29:57] criticized, it makes a shock
[1:29:58] responsibility to correct error because
[1:30:01] we become afraid of the consequences.
[1:30:03] Are you with us? Let's go to another
[1:30:05] one. Uh just the yellow portions. And
[1:30:08] sometimes we try to sh pull back from
[1:30:10] criticism. Well, that's only testing.
[1:30:12] It's golden nuggets to you back at the
[1:30:14] bottom. So the criticism, we welcome
[1:30:16] that because that's what we have to have
[1:30:18] to put us through fiery trials. This is
[1:30:21] why, you know, just off the topic, you
[1:30:23] know, I could always have brothers
[1:30:25] telling me, you know, I shut the
[1:30:26] comments off on YouTube channels. I
[1:30:28] don't even read it. But it's like
[1:30:30] they're saying this about you, they're
[1:30:31] saying that about you. I don't care.
[1:30:34] It's not hurting me. Firstly, cuz I I'm
[1:30:36] not reading them. But even if they do,
[1:30:38] what's wrong with with being criticized?
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with people telling lies
[1:30:43] about you? What's wrong with people uh
[1:30:46] trying to twist YOUR WORDS? IT MUST BE
[1:30:49] DONE.
[1:30:53] When the word is revealed to you
[1:30:54] personally, it criticizes your motives,
[1:30:57] your actions, and every aspect of your
[1:30:59] life. I think shutting off the comments
[1:31:01] is cowardly. It's like you want people
[1:31:04] to like you.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; That's what I believe, right? You rather
[1:31:09] be judged by the word here than at the
[1:31:12] judgment.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the natural tendency is to
[1:31:16] being ch to being challenged is to shock
[1:31:18] the challenge.
[1:31:20] live rather live in the facade, live in
[1:31:23] the lies and not be challenged. This is
[1:31:26] the first mysterious human manifestation
[1:31:29] that truth causes. Are you listening?
[1:31:32] When someone tells you the truth, the
[1:31:33] first thing is either if the truth is
[1:31:36] favorable to you, want to go spread it.
[1:31:37] If it's not, you want to sherk it,
[1:31:41] right? Uh man running from the presence.
[1:31:43] We know there has to be a true answer.
[1:31:45] Look at the first statement. We're
[1:31:47] living in the hour of the coming of the
[1:31:49] Lord.
[1:31:51] Why are there not people running out to
[1:31:53] tell it?
[1:31:57] Why?
[1:31:58] What are you afraid of?
[1:32:00] We know there has to be a true answer to
[1:32:03] this, right? There's people here in the
[1:32:06] country now is going to caves and things
[1:32:07] and the 16th of March, you read the
[1:32:09] newspaper. Remember, we just had it 21st
[1:32:12] September, we had some guy in South
[1:32:13] Africa told us the rapture is taking
[1:32:15] place.
[1:32:19] He says there's got to be a true answer
[1:32:22] somewhere to the problem. Right? There's
[1:32:24] got to be a truth. There paragraph 92. I
[1:32:27] want to I want to shift on paragraph 94.
[1:32:29] It's always been that way. It's been a
[1:32:31] man has sherked and went away from God
[1:32:33] ever since Adam in the Garden of Eden.
[1:32:35] Go home and read it. I want to rush
[1:32:37] through it. God only give them about
[1:32:39] eight or 10 words to keep. Adam and Eve,
[1:32:43] right? It's so true. But of the tree
[1:32:45] they shall not eat that. Then Adam said
[1:32:47] had to face up. Will will I will I do as
[1:32:50] my wife has said or shall I do what God
[1:32:52] said to do? And he walked out with his
[1:32:54] eyes open. He had to take the
[1:32:56] responsibility to throw the whole human
[1:32:58] race into death. I want you to I want
[1:33:01] you to see how the prophet brings the
[1:33:03] truth of the day to ex to into being
[1:33:06] exactly what Adam shked. Adam had the
[1:33:09] truth. He shook the responsibility.
[1:33:11] Right? You have to make a choice on the
[1:33:14] truth presented to you saints. Many
[1:33:16] people have an idea about the coming of
[1:33:18] the Lord. But there's a true answer
[1:33:20] somewhere.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Are we going to TELL IT?
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; WE MUST TELL THE PEOPLE THAT WE are
[1:33:26] living in the hours of the coming of the
[1:33:27] Lord. WE CANNOT SHOCK this
[1:33:29] responsibility. This is the reason
[1:33:31] Christian people are coasting.
[1:33:36] I'll give up sin next year. I'll give up
[1:33:38] sin the year after. I'll stop committing
[1:33:42] adultery next year. I'll stop doing this
[1:33:45] the next year. And the reason why they
[1:33:48] won't even come to our church is because
[1:33:50] we call it out because they're
[1:33:53] comfortable where there are lies being
[1:33:55] spoken.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:58] &gt;&gt; This is the problem. This is the problem
[1:34:00] they have with the prophet is because he
[1:34:02] calls it out and yet it's biblical.
[1:34:07] It's righteous.
[1:34:10] We cannot sh this responsibility. The
[1:34:12] truth will cause human reactions. Right
[1:34:16] now the prophet says every man had to
[1:34:19] face up to the responsibility for his
[1:34:21] day. There's got to there's got to be a
[1:34:24] responsibility before God and they had
[1:34:26] to do it. And he says coming to sons of
[1:34:29] God that's the reason they were sent for
[1:34:32] that hour.
[1:34:35] You were sent for the reason to tell
[1:34:37] that truth.
[1:34:41] So what do we do? Human reaction is to
[1:34:43] make a substitute, right? Like Adam,
[1:34:46] first thing to do is try to make a
[1:34:48] substitute in some way. Try to find a
[1:34:50] way out, right? And he speaks about
[1:34:53] putting a fig leaf around him and so on,
[1:34:55] right? Then he tries to find a
[1:34:57] substitute to kind of cover himself up
[1:35:00] with it, which is what every cloak of
[1:35:03] religion is.
[1:35:05] IT'S IT'S TRYING TO FIND A way to make
[1:35:08] it okay to do what you're doing and
[1:35:11] still make you feel like you're saved.
[1:35:14] You're a Christian. You're going to
[1:35:16] heaven.
[1:35:18] Right? That's just about the way we do
[1:35:20] it today. An excuse back down. FIND OUT
[1:35:24] what is right.
[1:35:26] You don't want to wait any longer. Let's
[1:35:28] find out now what's truth and what's
[1:35:30] right and stay with it. We know that
[1:35:33] it's true.
[1:35:34] Sons of God will find the truth.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; They're not going to sit around.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; So here's another negative mysterious
[1:35:43] reaction. Lastly, saints, what we don't
[1:35:48] want is the popular idea. We know it. He
[1:35:51] says here in men running from the
[1:35:52] presence, a wonderful um message. I like
[1:35:56] the one statement the prophet says
[1:35:58] there.
[1:36:00] Your your way was paid to Nineveh, not
[1:36:02] to Tashish.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Think about that. Now we know his
[1:36:10] presence here. It's vindicated. We are
[1:36:11] having it. We are trusting in this week.
[1:36:13] It'll continue to be vindicated among
[1:36:15] us. Sick will be healed. Great things
[1:36:16] will take place. We don't want the
[1:36:19] popular idea. We want the truth. And we
[1:36:23] don't we don't want to face up to
[1:36:25] nothing but what God said is the truth.
[1:36:28] Back down. is going to catch you
[1:36:30] somewhere now. SO YOU CAN ONLY SHERK IT
[1:36:34] for a certain period of time before it
[1:36:36] catches up with you.
[1:36:38] Saints, you got something to confess to
[1:36:40] your wife, do it.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; She may hate you for one month, two
[1:36:45] months, 3 months, eventually she'll
[1:36:47] honor you for telling the truth. You got
[1:36:49] something confessed to your brother,
[1:36:50] tell it. You got something confessed to
[1:36:53] your mom, dad, whoever, tell them.
[1:36:55] You'll have some pain for a small
[1:36:57] period, but when you accumulate it,
[1:37:02] every person I know who has to try and
[1:37:04] confess it five years later, it's a
[1:37:06] massive mess and a breakup and
[1:37:09] shattering of lives. If you got
[1:37:12] something to confess and and THEN YOU
[1:37:14] CONFESS IT AFTER YOU HAD LIKE THREE
[1:37:15] CHILDREN, YOU'RE NOW GOING TO DESTROY
[1:37:17] THE LIVES OF THREE CHILDREN.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; WHEREAS, IF YOU DID IT BEFORE YOU EVEN
[1:37:21] HAD THE CHILDREN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
[1:37:23] MESS LIVES UP.
[1:37:25] THINK ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; In closing, it's the truth that sets you
[1:37:32] free.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; We'll come to that.
[1:37:40] John 8:31-32.
[1:37:42] Said, "The truth shall set you free." We
[1:37:46] need to really understand what this
[1:37:47] means. Why do you need to be set free?
[1:37:49] Because you are bound by lies.
[1:37:53] Right? Free of what? Free of the
[1:37:56] clutches of falsehood. When you are
[1:37:58] stuck in a belief that does not contain
[1:38:00] the truth of the day, it's restrictive.
[1:38:03] It does not contain joy of salvation. It
[1:38:05] does not have freedom of worship. It
[1:38:07] does not have freedom to be yourself, to
[1:38:09] be unique. If you continue in the word,
[1:38:12] this means to believe the word and to
[1:38:15] remain constant in it. And that proves
[1:38:17] you are true disciples. Are you with us?
[1:38:20] Okay. I'm going to close with like 23
[1:38:22] points here. Firstly, to explain truth.
[1:38:27] I already told you it's not evidence,
[1:38:30] it's not knowledge. Right? So, I was
[1:38:33] well, I was talking to brother Kale. So,
[1:38:35] I'll use that example. All right? We
[1:38:37] were talking on on the brother's uh chat
[1:38:39] and I told him,
[1:38:42] let's say you got into your car, your
[1:38:45] father's car,
[1:38:46] and you and you went to Macro. So I know
[1:38:50] where he stays, right? So I said, "You
[1:38:53] went to Macro. You come back home. Your
[1:38:55] dad asks you where did you go?" Right?
[1:38:57] And he says, "I went to Macro." Is that
[1:38:59] the truth?
[1:39:02] He actually went to Macro.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; But the question is, where did you go?
[1:39:06] Now the entire truth is you turn right
[1:39:10] into McGregor Road, you turn left into
[1:39:11] Donata Avenue, you turn right into
[1:39:13] Rosalyn, you turn left into Alpine Road,
[1:39:16] you Brickfield Road, you went down
[1:39:18] Alpine Road, you turn left into, you
[1:39:20] turn left again at the value center, you
[1:39:22] turn left into into Macro. That's the
[1:39:25] truth. So I told him, can you imagine
[1:39:28] telling your dad that
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; your dad's going to say, "What is wrong
[1:39:32] with you? IT'S WHERE DID YOU GO?" I'M
[1:39:34] TELLING YOU WHERE I WENT.
[1:39:37] WHICH means most likely you cannot even
[1:39:40] handle the whole truth.
[1:39:44] It's too much for you to handle.
[1:39:48] This is the reality. If if what you're
[1:39:51] asking for you actually don't know, you
[1:39:54] can't handle it.
[1:39:56] Right? And then of course there's the
[1:39:58] other thing because on the way there he
[1:40:01] could have stopped at uh the garage and
[1:40:04] used the phone booth to call his secret
[1:40:05] girlfriend
[1:40:08] but he went to macro,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; right, brother Kale?
[1:40:15] All right, young uh Sunday school.
[1:40:20] I remember this because we're going to
[1:40:21] tell you, we're going to talk about
[1:40:22] Sunday school. You all awake? I hope you
[1:40:24] haven't been sleeping because I was
[1:40:25] watching you.
[1:40:28] What is the truth of this,
[1:40:31] Sean? What is that
[1:40:34] apple?
[1:40:35] Huh? Who says it's an apple?
[1:40:39] Casey, it's an apple. Yeah. Uh,
[1:40:45] no. What happened to our Africanas?
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark, well, you have a Uber
[1:40:51] surname. I'm
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; French.
[1:40:55] Okay.
[1:40:56] You said it's an apple. Yes, Seth. It's
[1:41:00] an apple. In Africans, it's apple.
[1:41:03] What's it in sha, brother Robert?
[1:41:07] Brother Robert. Huh?
[1:41:11] Okay. Anybody knows what it's in Zulu?
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh. How about Japanese?
[1:41:22] How about Chinese? How about Arabian?
[1:41:25] Yeah. So, is it an apple or is it not an
[1:41:28] apple?
[1:41:30] Okay.
[1:41:32] What is the truth of this apple? How do
[1:41:35] you know it's an apple? Where are your
[1:41:37] link sources and reliable
[1:41:41] people with credentials?
[1:41:45] What is the truth? What color is it?
[1:41:48] Huh?
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Red. Yes.
[1:41:52] And and where does it where do you get
[1:41:54] it from?
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; A tree.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; A tree. It grows in a tree.
[1:42:00] So all we got so far are facts.
[1:42:03] Now I want someone here to tell me what
[1:42:06] is the truth of an apple. I'm waiting.
[1:42:12] What is the truth of an apple?
[1:42:16] You know what's the truth of an apple?
[1:42:18] Somebody who doesn't know what it's
[1:42:19] called, where it comes from, but they
[1:42:21] know what to do with it.
[1:42:25] What do you do with an apple?
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Right now, how many of you can describe
[1:42:30] to me in the best language what an apple
[1:42:34] tastes like?
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; Yes, buddy.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; A strawberry.
[1:42:46] Anybody?
[1:42:49] Anybody who's so educated? Where is it?
[1:42:52] Yes.
[1:42:55] Like juicy.
[1:42:58] Yeah, it is. It is juicy. But who can
[1:43:01] describe to me what it tastes like?
[1:43:04] Abby, it's sweet. Yeah, but what's
[1:43:07] sweet? Sweet has been sugary.
[1:43:10] You adults who are you got your degrees
[1:43:13] and you guys with degrees and whatever.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; What does it taste like?
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; There you go. It tastes like an apple.
[1:43:24] WHICH MEANS AFTER 6,000 YEARS OF EATING
[1:43:27] APPLES, you cannot describe to me what
[1:43:29] an apple tastes like. YOU CANNOT TELL me
[1:43:33] what it tastes LIKE. YOU CANNOT EVEN USE
[1:43:35] FIVE words to describe it. You can only
[1:43:38] tell me it tastes like an apple. SHE
[1:43:40] MEANS ALL THE KNOWLEDGE. YES, brother
[1:43:41] Liam.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:43:50] So all we have is facts,
[1:43:53] reliable sources,
[1:43:56] but the truth you cannot describe.
[1:44:00] You can give it to an infant who doesn't
[1:44:02] know what it is, where it comes from, uh
[1:44:06] how it grows, what its seed looks like,
[1:44:08] what its tree looks like, which ground
[1:44:09] it grew up in. Most of you here don't
[1:44:12] even know what's the biological name of
[1:44:14] apple.
[1:44:16] Right? Do you know that once apple was
[1:44:18] the universal name for all fruit? This
[1:44:21] is why you have art apple and every
[1:44:23] other apple in the Dutch because they
[1:44:26] used to call any fruit the apple of the
[1:44:29] tree. Did you know that?
[1:44:32] BUT YOU CANNOT TELL ME THE TRUTH OF AN
[1:44:34] APPLE. BUT YET YOU KNOW THE truth of an
[1:44:37] apple.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE TRUTH OF AN apple even
[1:44:42] though you you you GOT ALL THE FACTS AND
[1:44:45] YOU THE FACTS ARE NOT EVEN TASTY.
[1:44:49] Whether it's red, whether it's shape,
[1:44:50] WHATEVER IT IS, WHAT ground you grow,
[1:44:52] none of that is important. NONE OF THAT
[1:44:54] PRODUCES ANY POWER IN YOU. But you know
[1:44:58] it's good for you. You know you can eat
[1:45:01] it. You know you can taste it. You can't
[1:45:04] explain that.
[1:45:06] That's the truth.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; The rest is evidence and knowledge.
[1:45:14] Oh, taste and see
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; that the Lord is good
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; with all the knowledge you can have,
[1:45:23] with all the preaching, with all the
[1:45:25] theology, with all the Bible schools,
[1:45:27] with all the the doctrines you can have,
[1:45:30] if you don't taste, all you have is
[1:45:33] knowledge.
[1:45:35] This is the reason all those who study
[1:45:39] theology and Bible and even the message
[1:45:42] if you haven't met him
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; the only people who POSSESS THE TRUTH
[1:45:47] AND ARE POSSESSED OF THE TRUTH are the
[1:45:50] ones who have met him
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; who have tasted of the heavenly gift
[1:45:55] that's the people who have the truth
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; and those are the people who can tell
[1:46:01] you when you're preaching in error ever.
[1:46:03] And when you're pre when you're not, you
[1:46:05] can have a lady who is a housewife who
[1:46:08] irons clothes and washes CLOTHES AND
[1:46:10] STUFF AND DOES NOT STUDY DOCTRINES, BUT
[1:46:12] SHE CAN TELL you you're preaching wrong.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Because she has tasted
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; so if you believe in facts, I want to
[1:46:23] ask you young people today, how much
[1:46:25] evidence do you need to fully believe
[1:46:28] that God exists and he created the
[1:46:30] universe and the world we live in today?
[1:46:32] How much evidence is enough to make you
[1:46:35] believe in God?
[1:46:37] How about when does the evidence stop?
[1:46:43] Right now, science is a baby. Do you
[1:46:45] know that?
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Science like started a few hundred years
[1:46:48] ago. Because that's when they were able
[1:46:51] to collect evidence that could prove
[1:46:53] anything or something.
[1:46:56] Truth needs an element of faith.
[1:47:01] See, that's the thing. Evidence doesn't
[1:47:04] need faith. Evidence needs recognition.
[1:47:07] Which is why when you're having
[1:47:08] conversation with people and YOU'RE
[1:47:10] PRESENTING EVIDENCE AND FACTS AND AND
[1:47:12] CONCEPTS and whatever, they're just
[1:47:14] looking at it as knowledge. You're not
[1:47:17] telling them truth because the truth is
[1:47:20] too much
[1:47:22] for them to be to to be put into words.
[1:47:25] If truth does not come by revelation,
[1:47:28] you cannot possess it.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; If everything is about evidence, where
[1:47:34] is the faith?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; If there is no faith, there is no power.
[1:47:38] IF THERE IS NO POWER, there is no change
[1:47:40] to life. You can GIVE PEOPLE ALL THE
[1:47:42] FACTS, IT WILL NOT CHANGE their life.
[1:47:47] What do people Why do people not believe
[1:47:51] though there is an abundance of
[1:47:53] evidence?
[1:47:56] Right. What about the seventh seal?
[1:47:59] Listen to this saints. We we have to
[1:48:00] preach the seventh seal to people. We
[1:48:02] have to preach what the first fold is,
[1:48:04] the second fold, third fold. Do you is
[1:48:06] there any mystery as to why people don't
[1:48:08] believe what we say when we present them
[1:48:11] evidence?
[1:48:13] Because unless they taste and see, they
[1:48:16] will never know. Yeah,
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN PRODUCE ALL THE QUOTES you want
[1:48:20] in a specific format, under a different
[1:48:23] subject, UNDER A DIFFERENT HEADING,
[1:48:25] UNDER A DIFFERENT TEACHING. Unless they
[1:48:27] connect with the Holy Spirit himself,
[1:48:29] there's no way, there's no convincing.
[1:48:32] There's no certain ministry.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[1:48:37] I want to ask I want to be as clear with
[1:48:40] you as possible.
[1:48:42] What proof do we have of Christ?
[1:48:46] What evidence do we have of Christ? the
[1:48:47] shroud of Turin,
[1:48:50] the witnesses of men. How do you know he
[1:48:52] was born of a virgin?
[1:48:55] How do you know he raised from the dead?
[1:48:58] How do you know who wrote the book of
[1:49:00] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? What
[1:49:03] evidence did do you have that the words
[1:49:05] written in those gospels are actually
[1:49:07] the word of Christ? Do you know?
[1:49:11] Can you prove it?
[1:49:13] Can you prove that Noah built an ark and
[1:49:16] there was a flood? Do you have evidence
[1:49:18] that Moses opened up the Red Sea? Do you
[1:49:21] have evidence that Daniel killed Goliath
[1:49:25] with one stone?
[1:49:27] Do you have evidence, proof, facts,
[1:49:30] links, sources, or anyone with authority
[1:49:34] to tell you and prove to you everything
[1:49:36] that there is in the Bible? No, you
[1:49:39] don't. No one has it. Though people will
[1:49:43] try archaeology, this finding under the
[1:49:46] temple mount, this finding the shot of
[1:49:48] Turin, this in the cave, this it proves
[1:49:51] nothing. It doesn't even matter. It's
[1:49:55] what you believe.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; It's not the evidence that changed lives
[1:50:00] and made people repent of sin. It's
[1:50:03] faith. It's the belief that it was truth
[1:50:06] that changed lives that changed
[1:50:08] governments and constitutions and
[1:50:10] RESHAPED SOCIETY. IT WASN'T ACTUAL
[1:50:13] EVIDENCE. TODAY THEY THEY CRYING FOR
[1:50:16] EVIDENCE FOR A GOD FOR THE ONE WHO
[1:50:18] CREATED THE UNIVERSE. BUT THE FAITH
[1:50:21] CHANGED PEOPLE,
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; COUNTRIES.
[1:50:25] The the FAITH CHANGES A DRUG ADDICT TO
[1:50:27] BEING CLEAN IN ONE DAY.
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; NOT EVIDENCE.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:50:34] And I'm talking to you. What proof do we
[1:50:37] have of William Brandon?
[1:50:39] What proof do we have of the cloud
[1:50:41] outside of the picture? What proof do we
[1:50:44] have of the mysterious week when he
[1:50:46] preached the seals? Do you realize our
[1:50:48] entire teaching and belief is based on
[1:50:52] the dreams and visions of a man
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; who was born in Kentucky,
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; who claims to have had the angel visit
[1:51:01] him, who saw dreams and visions
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; and who spoke in words that were
[1:51:06] uneducated
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; and without proper grammar. You you mean
[1:51:10] our lives, our marriages, our raising of
[1:51:13] our children, the jobs we choose, the
[1:51:16] way we dress, the holiday places WE GO
[1:51:19] TO IS DEFINED BY WHAT THAT MAN TAUGHT
[1:51:22] US.
[1:51:26] Why would you follow it?
[1:51:30] There's only one reason is because your
[1:51:32] faith changed you somehow.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; And you'll not change from that. No
[1:51:38] matter what evidence is produced in you,
[1:51:40] you and I know what it did for us.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Because we've tasted
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; and when you've tasted, there's no words
[1:51:49] to describe it.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; You are the proof. You are the evidence.
[1:51:54] You are the only evidence. You you
[1:51:56] cannot even depend on on your your mind,
[1:51:59] your reasoning, on how you read the
[1:52:01] message and how you construct the
[1:52:04] doctrine out of it. YOU CAN'T. IT'S HOW
[1:52:06] IT IS REVEALED
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN IT IS REVEALED WHEN YOU TASTE
[1:52:10] AND WHAT IT DOES TO YOU.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:12] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Other than that, you got nothing. You
[1:52:17] can produce the best music in your
[1:52:19] church. You can produce the best
[1:52:21] anointing IN YOUR CHURCH. YOU CAN HAVE
[1:52:22] PEOPLE FALLING DOWN, CRYING, AND ALL OF
[1:52:24] THAT. IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO PRODUCE
[1:52:26] anything
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; or or prove to YOU ANYTHING OR CHANGE
[1:52:30] YOU. There must be a personal connection
[1:52:33] with the truth.
[1:52:35] and the truth shall set you free.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Everything we have is based on another
[1:52:40] man's dreams, visions, and experiences.
[1:52:43] On that statement alone, that's enough
[1:52:45] to say, "Let's walk away."
[1:52:48] Because if I came here next week and
[1:52:50] told you I had dreams, visions, and
[1:52:51] prophecies, and I saw an angel, are you
[1:52:53] just going to believe me?
[1:52:55] No.
[1:52:58] What proof do we have of Christ?
[1:53:01] Why is your whole life depended on the
[1:53:03] words of Christ and prophets who you
[1:53:07] have not met, who you do not know?
[1:53:10] Truth is not received by evidence, young
[1:53:13] people, but by believing.
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; This is why I'm encouraging you in your
[1:53:19] life with your husband and wife, with
[1:53:22] your children, with your parents,
[1:53:25] believe in each other.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; That's a better life.
[1:53:30] Believe in one another.
[1:53:32] Don't think proof and evidence makes
[1:53:34] your life better. It doesn't. It makes
[1:53:37] it worse.
[1:53:39] Believe one another.
[1:53:41] Love one. To love one is to believe
[1:53:44] them. Amen.
[1:53:46] &gt;&gt; Sons of God, truth is not received by
[1:53:49] evidence and by believing but by
[1:53:51] believing. Sons of God will find truth.
[1:53:56] And the truth is God. Amen.
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; And the knowledge of the truth is Christ
[1:54:04] the word.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if the knowledge of the
[1:54:08] knowledge reveals the truth, then the
[1:54:11] word is truth. If the knowledge does not
[1:54:14] reveal the truth, it's not the truth.
[1:54:17] So you can have preaching and teaching
[1:54:19] in Christian churches that does not lead
[1:54:21] you to God. That means that knowledge is
[1:54:24] just knowledge. It's not truth. It
[1:54:27] doesn't have truth in it. See, Christ is
[1:54:30] the word and the word was made flesh and
[1:54:31] dwelt among us. The word was in the
[1:54:34] beginning with God and the word was God.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; The word must lead you to God.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; And when you taste that word and if you
[1:54:42] taste truth, you'll never change from
[1:54:44] it.
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; If Christ reveals God, then Christ is
[1:54:49] God. Yes.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; Sons of God then who search for the word
[1:54:53] and find truth. Those sons of God search
[1:54:56] for Christ and find God. And what
[1:54:59] happens when you have truth? The truth
[1:55:02] possesses you.
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; When sons of God find truth, then they
[1:55:07] are possessed by the truth.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; You love him, saints.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
