The Seven Virtues

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So now we can stand together and read the word of God. We're going to read from second Peter chapter 1 uh verse 5. Am I plugged in here? Oh, there we go. So, our our series that I'm supposed I'm supposed to be in Newcastle and brother Shadrach was supposed to be speaking here this morning and uh so and our title is going to be the seven virtues. So, I'm actually preaching to the Newcastle people um this morning cuz I was supposed to be there. So, we're going to read 2 Peter 1:5-7. And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge, temperance, and to temperance, patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, charity. Amen. The Lord add a blessing to his word. You may be seated. Um, getting to this uh subject, for those of you, I hope you were able to listen to the audios or watch it on YouTube. the first part that we did in Newcastle. So the stature of a perfect man and for a title the seven virtues. All right. So if you remember this uh you everybody knows this diagram by now. It's such a common diagram in the message. And um you can see that uh we've got the names of the ages on the I think I've got a pointer here. Where am I? There we go. Huh? &gt;&gt; Doesn't work on the screen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't work on the screen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Useless thing. So the Ephesus to Leodosia, you got your church agents on the left and of course the uh the the messengers on the right that written in the center faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness. Those are what we call virtues. Okay. So I want to today I I um we have a very simple message but I the simplicity of it is before you get to the whole series of it and understand all of those things just to understand what is the seven virtues right and when you look at those things faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and you look at that you think nothing there smacks of super supernatural these are things you can find in anybody body in the world. &gt;&gt; People have faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance. Some wealthy people have more temperance than we do. &gt;&gt; You know, uh patience. There are there are people in this world who who don't have the message. They're not Christians. They don't even read the Bible, but they don't drink alcohol. &gt;&gt; They don't smoke. They don't do drugs. They don't fornicate. They've got many of those or even all of those. I don't know. But there are many of these people who have these virtues. So what's so special about this that uh we have to have them and this is the reason why when you look at that they can never be the seven thunders the revelation of the seven thunders &gt;&gt; because that means a lot of people out in the world have these thunders then &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and they literally have it I've met message people since I'm a child there's no way I'm going to ever tell you I met someone who has all seven imperfection cuz you just someone's toes and you'll know how much of virtues they actually have or say something that insults them or you know you see all those virtues fly out the window. So don't tell me these are thunders and that that's the mystery that that was supposed to be revealed and brings you all to perfection. No, this not what it is. That's why you need to understand we need to understand what this is about. So let's not lose the focus that this whole thing what this this story is about is about developing the character of the believer &gt;&gt; for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. It's developing a believer into a mature individual. God needs you to have as much faith that is necessary to fulfill the purpose for your day. God needs you to have as much virtue as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for your day. As much knowledge, what is I mean where do we stop with knowledge? Just think just let's take knowledge for example. When do you stop reading the Bible and the message and say okay I know enough. &gt;&gt; Huh? Anybody? &gt;&gt; So when do you perfect knowledge? &gt;&gt; When do you stop learning? Never. &gt;&gt; So there is no fullness of knowledge. There is no fullness of virtue. In fact, in the Bible, it tells you if you are overrighteous, it's bad. &gt;&gt; Don't be over wicked and don't be overrighteous. &gt;&gt; You need the correct amount of it for your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is necessary. This is why you This is why I'm telling you, you literally will have people in the world who have some of these virtues in abundance and more than you could ever have it and yet will never believe the word of God &gt;&gt; or agree to do his purpose. Right? So these attributes, these virtues, these attributes, they are there to fulfill the purpose of God. for a believer to be developed towards something to fulfill your your purpose to its maximum potential, right? Like Samson needed enough of this character to bring down the Philistines and that was it. When he wasn't bringing down the Philistines, he was a horrible person. He literally was with the harlot and then the spirit of God came upon him to kill the Philistines and he went back to being with the harlot. Right? &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. God is interested in his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not interested in making you this bright shining human being that everybody's going to love and come to you and say, "Teach me more. &gt;&gt; Teach me more. You are the savior of mankind. No, he doesn't want to do that. He has chosen you to fulfill a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine being in Luther's day and Luther has some of these and and Luther comes out and says, you know, the the the Holy Ghost inspires Luther and the just to live by faith. But Luther says, I want to reveal the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; You know, that's I just feel like I want to do that. &gt;&gt; It's not called for him to do that. He's not callering to reveal the seals or preach the church ages. He has he's been called to the just shall live by faith and that's what he's going to stick to. That's as much is the measure that he's ever going to have. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And John Wesley, this is why they got so frustrated reading the book of Revelations. They couldn't understand it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. So these attributes and there are actually eight because with love there are eight that are mentioned here in this pyramid diagram they are in itself each one a mystery. &gt;&gt; Faith is a mystery. Virtue is a mystery. Knowledge is a mystery. Each one on its own is a mystery. And then all eight and the way they are placed according to the word is another mystery. You can't start with brotherly kindness. You can't have patience at number two. You can't have godliness at number three. This this is what I mean. The way the prophet of the hour was inspired to set it out is perfectly the development. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The actual development is perfect. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Um Peter when he spoke this in in in 2 Peter 1 5-7 didn't realize that one day there was going to pro there's going to be a prophet who will come and show us the development of a of a child of God &gt;&gt; through the church ages. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This man Peter was just was saying, you know, add to your faith, virtue add to Peter wasn't even thinking, I am preaching this now because so and so 2,000 years from now is going to equate this to the thunders. &gt;&gt; He had no idea what he was what he was going to start off. &gt;&gt; This poor guy &gt;&gt; preached this, died, and he's in the sixth dimension somewhere and listening to people make a big deal about what kind of doctrine it is. No, they are the most sought after natures or character traits in the world. It doesn't matter which religion there is. Anybody who sees a person who has faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, and brotherly kindness, they look at you and say, "That is a good person. &gt;&gt; That is a great person." They will look at you and say, "I wish I could be like you." Or I wish all people could be like you. Everybody who sees a person with these attributes, it doesn't matter. You could be the worst person on earth. They will respect you and say that is a good person, &gt;&gt; but that's it. You're a good person, &gt;&gt; right? So, everybody wants to believe that they have faith. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Or that they have temperance or that they are patient etc. And all religions teach these characteristics as being what is good. &gt;&gt; All religions respect that. &gt;&gt; Even Islam. &gt;&gt; They probably have a ninth one which says violence. I don't know but which is a holy war. I don't know how they pull all that together but they will also respect that you know. Oh, you can laugh at them and mock them and so on when it comes to Islam, but there's there's one thing about them. They keep their faith. &gt;&gt; They believe in something that they outshine people who they don't they don't only keep that. They make sure their kids are educated from 5 years old. &gt;&gt; They make sure their kids are dedicated to their prophet and their scripture. And then they teach their kids to uh to to dress according to their religion and keep it wherever they go and go to their holy temple and go for their Hajj and their you don't find that among other people and if that makes them uh so strong in their religion how you know somebody showed me this clip the other day of a of a a Muslim man who was being questioned by another Christian and the the the guy was saying to to him, "What is this?" He said to him, "Uh, why are you in a western country? Uh, why don't you stay in a Muslim country?" He said, "Cuz I can't spread Islam in a Muslim country. They already accepted Islam." He said, "Then why are you here in a Christian country?" "Well, I'm here to make converts." And he said, "And then the Christian guy is saying, but can I come to your country and make converts?" He said, "No." &gt;&gt; He said, "But why?" He said, "Well, it's not our fault. You are liberal. &gt;&gt; In our country, we will not allow you to make Christian converts because we believe Islam is the religion." He says, "Don't you think it's unfair?" He said, "Yeah, but this is how it is. So, my belief is I must be here in your country to make as many converts for Allah, but you can't come to my country and make converts to Christianity. It will kill you. Hey, that's faith. See, that's faith. And that's holding to their religion. It's a there are traits, there are characteristics. And you can admire some of these people for the way they think. It could be deluded. It could sound unfair. But this is the thing. These these are traits that people hold to. &gt;&gt; Yeah. What is it that you need? Right? So there are they are right. All religions they are right. You're supposed to be like this. They all teach no matter what their beliefs are. They the holy people of all religions tell you how to be that marriage is good that you should be a good husband. You should be a good wife. You should be obedient children. All religions teach you. I don't know a religion that tells you you must be disrespectful to your parents or you must walk out of the house and or you must beat up your wife to a pulp or you must disrespect your husband. I don't know religious scriptures they all teach good things you know so they are right only they have made up ways to get these characteristics they have humanistic ways they have um uh uh ways to follow that are outside of the word of God for you to achieve them right like meditation like sit down calm yourself, do your breathing, meditate on something and then you will be become more patient, you know, um you can meditate as long as you want to. Someone comes and slap you in the face 10 times, you lose all the meditation you ever had. Right? So we even meet some people of the world who seem to have some of these attributes. You meet people in stores and in shopping areas, they are good people. They have they are kind. They are generous. They're help like like the guy who helped me yesterday. His name was Peacock. His his nickname was Peacock. And I met him and I I he helped me change my tire. I gave him something for his children, some money, what I had on me. I And there was another fellow walking by. He's just a beggar with three buckets on his back. He even offered me some uh some solution of soap and water which is carrying in his bucket to wash my hand. I looked in Hold on a second. I don't know. I don't know what's in there. Don't worry, my wife's got wet wipes. I'm going to But he got in there, too, and helped me out. You know, there are good people everywhere. And so, we meet a lot of people in the world with these attributes. Those who have them in measure are often respected. Like very often, you know, you meet you go to a hospital, you meet a doctor and you say, "I like him. He's a very patient man. You meet another one, I don't like him. His bedside manners are terrible. You know, he's so rude and he doesn't care for my feelings. You know, he's not there to care for your feelings. He's there to patch you up. You know, you must take care of your own feelings. But you respect that. You expect here am I standing there. I'm I'm lying on a bed. You know, I'm exposed. My arms are you poking me with stuff. At least be kind. He's not there to be kind. He's there to find a vein to stick a needle in and take some blood out. There's no kindness about that. But you feel like ah be gentle, you know, have some virtue. He wants to get the job done and get paid and get out of there, right? But you all know you want to see people with virtue, &gt;&gt; right? A lot of us are hypocrites, right? No, no, no. &gt;&gt; You know, you want the doctors to be gentle with you, but just watch yourself pulling out a splinter from your child's foot and the child is like, "Don't touch me." YOU'RE LIKE, "TRUST ME." You got to ply in your hand and a and a tweezer or something. Hold him still like get wife tape his mouth down OR SOMETHING. HOLD HIS HANDS. &gt;&gt; And then you think I want a doctor who's gentle. So virtues, brother Random called them virtues for a good reason and that's why we want to understand because we need to first understand why God chose to call them virtues and why they are placed the way they are right now. Brother Von desired to do a study but he just never got to do it. Right? I and I believe he left this hint for us. So if we read in the message statue of a perfect man paragraph 345 he says see what I mean see how these virtues these building materials typed in with the church messengers with the church ages you see how that fits in with the diagram &gt;&gt; building materials typed in with the church messengers and with the church ages. That's what our diagram was. Now, one of these days, we're going to take each one of these words and study them out and show that it proves this. It all goes together. One of these days, he only preached this in statue of a perfect man and blasphemous names and never did it. &gt;&gt; That's why I say he gave us the hint. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; we can do that, right? So, see how wonderful that is. He says, see what it does. All right. So virtue the word virtue comes from the Latin vir meaning strength. Virtue means strength. Okay. Why are these attributes called virtues? Uh nowhere in the Bible that will you ever find it written seven virtues. In fact there are eight spoken of in 2 Peter 15-7 which is including charity. And as we said the last time, these were labeled virtues based on the ancient Greek teachings, then adopted by Christians. Remember, the ancient Greeks had four virtues and then the Romans adopted that. And then over time, they were called that by the Christian church. Brother Brand didn't just come up and make it up himself. They were adopted uh traditions and teachings that came from the Greeks and the Romans and then adopted into the Christian church and then the prophet had to retach it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So they are not mixed in with uh uh philosophies of educated men. And there are all kinds of theories on the virtues and some of the the teachings in Christian denominations. Uh if if you go for example, if you go to um any Protestant church and you ask them what are the virtues, the Christian virtues, they don't even tie it in with second Peter. They got other stuff that they'll teach you the the the eight virtues or the six virtues or seven virtues or something like that. Each denomination has its like own selection of virtues that they feel is, you know, what you're supposed to be keeping as a Christian. So it became a phrase the seven virtues coined by the ministry of the message made up by the ministry of the message and made very fashionable by the seven thunder seven virtues movement which was started over four decades ago. So now when you tell people that they they only talk about that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. The truth is there's nothing wrong with saying seven virtues because they are indeed virtues and they are indeed seven. Okay? So nobody's going to criticize you for saying seven virtues. And the thing is we can call them if you want characteristics or traits or natures or moral values or even good natures. You could say the seven good natures. all the seven moral values. You could call them whatever you want to, right? And you would all be about right. But the prophet called them virtues because of one important thing. They mean strengths. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you say moral values, it doesn't exactly say strengths. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it doesn't. He calls them building materials. All right. Let's read statue of a perfect man. uh 24 paragraph 3. Now first you must have faith. Faith alone won't do it. You've got Peter said then add virtue to your faith. You must have virtue in order to add it to your faith. It may be the reason you don't have it because many churches of today teach you you don't have to have it or the days of its past. They don't have to have it. Only thing you have to do is just join church. Yeah. Days has passed. virtue. Anyone knows what the word virtue means? See, we must have it. If virtue went from him, do I need to move it? There you go. If virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick, he's expecting the same virtue in his church because he was our example. &gt;&gt; If he had virtue to give to the people, he expects us to have virtue to give to the people. And what is virtue? Virtue is strength, power. Now in the denominations, they teach virtue to mean moral purity. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So with that, the only thing denominational churches teach as virtue is to be like uh have moral purity regarding like sexuality. to say she's a virtuous woman means she hasn't fornicated. So in other words, in the Christian church, if you talk about virtuous or virtue, they're referring to moral as in sexually moral purity. And that's where they stop. Brother Ram says virtue means strength, right? Of course, that is a part of virtue being moral, not fornicating and so on. Some of us, some of them, he says, don't even believe in the power of God. That's past. Only thing you have to do is just put your name on the book, be sprinkled or poured or baptized or whatever more. That's all you have to do. All right. So, you all with me? Virtue is strength. So, when you look at the seven virtues, not just the second one, there are seven strengths. building materials. Faith is a virtue. Virtue is a virtue. &gt;&gt; Knowledge is a virtue. Temperance is a virtue. &gt;&gt; They're all strengths. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, when we get to virtue, the second virtue, &gt;&gt; then we're going to understand what the mystery of that is. &gt;&gt; Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you read now, if you go into the Greek there and you you look up what the word there means in the Greek in second Peter and you click on that word virtue or you go to your concordance or something, it comes up with arete which means praise &gt;&gt; or any particular moral excellence you see there at the bottom as modesty. But the actual meaning is praise. Huh? Who would have thought that? Add to your faith praise. And and and this is the issue with our our language, our words. We usually have a very uh if I had to ask every one of us, write down on a page what you think praise means. All of you will have some kind of definition for the word. And most of you are going to look to the shortest, simplest definition. Right? And you're never going to dwell on it to think what does it really mean or how does this unfold or how do I apply this? We always go for the very simplest meaning the least complicated uh meaning of everything right which is a good thing except that when you look when you're now tying in the word virtue with praise how does this really fit in to building materials? So that's the original word in the Bible. Not even strength. Brother man says that virtue means strength. This is to describe the second attribute. So in there when you say when it says add to your faith virtue that is describing the second attribute. &gt;&gt; But brother Baron says they are all virtues. &gt;&gt; They are all strengths. So praise or moral excellence is the second attribute but it itself is a strength. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Then we have in the Bible the word strength. Now if you go to the Bible and you look at the word strength, it's the word dunamis in the Greek which means power, might or strength, right? And now seven virtues then means seven strengths. So in other words, if you're a believer and you have these seven strengths for your day, you have something that is giving you ability to do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you're never going to get into the position where you are going to do what God has called you until you have all the strengths required to do it. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, obviously, these are not the strengths of the body. They're the strengths of the spirit. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now if you know all of us can do some exercise, walk, stretch, you know, do I don't know whatever you do, uh, uh, lift some weights or get 10,000 steps in a day or do squats or something to increase muscle strength, right? How do you strengthen the spirit? &gt;&gt; What gym will you go to for that? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey, uh I'll tell you something. Intermittent fasting won't strengthen a spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's no intermittent fasting for the spirit. &gt;&gt; Um strengthening the spirit is something else. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It requires something else. People um look at strengthening the spirit with discipline, with abstinence, which is some kind of fasting, with um u methods, with philosophy, with um uh uh mental training, with positive thinking, with um what do you call it? with like um speaking positive words or maybe joining positive people or reading certain books, certain materials. People look to those things um something in psychology or something to strengthen their spirit, to better their mind, to change their thinking. You know what? This is the problem with this. You can't fight your DNA. &gt;&gt; You can only be positive as much as your DNA is going to allow you. If you have it in your genes to be angry, you're going to be angry to be jealous. You're going to be jealous. If you have it in your DNA to be somebody who's impatient, if you're driven by those chemicals and those the background you come from and your race and your parenting and the place you come from, this is who you're going to be. There is nothing in the world that can change your DNA but the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit. There's nothing else that can rewrite that coding &gt;&gt; but the Holy Spirit. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you can you can uh do all the positive thinking you want in the world. You can do all the the the programs. This is why even you know when you when you listen to people who are alcoholics to them they have this phrase once an alcoholic always an alcoholic. That doesn't happen in the with God. &gt;&gt; To them it's like once an addict always an addict. and they say to you, "I'm I'm I'm a I'm a recovered addict so many years clean or a drug addict so many years clean." When you come to God, there's no such thing as so many years clean. It's done for. I'm not that anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm no longer an addict. He has cleansed me from that. He's taken it out of me. I don't need chips and coins and trophies and that kind of thing. Are you with me? Why? Strengths have been added. &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful. So these strengths are far superior to the strength of the body. We've often heard this, the spirit is willing and the flesh is weak. The strength of the spirit can actually renew the strength of the body. The strength of the spirit can heal, can mend, can even push the body beyond what you think your limit is. Right now in the current relaxed state that you are in, some of you uh enjoy the sound of my voice and might feel this is a perfect time to doze off to sleep. You know, do you know why people fall asleep in church? It's not because they're disrespectful. It's because their bodies start to relax. You're so highly strong. You're so tense everywhere else. When you sit in a place that is comfortable, it's natural for your body to fall asleep. &gt;&gt; It's actually, you know why you fall asleep? Because you feel safe. Yeah, that's what's happening. You're actually feeling safe. You feel secure, right? For those pe for some people other people come into church and feel terribly insecure like everybody's watching me nervous. But those people who do fall asleep it actually tells me they're very comfortable. I'm so happy you're comfortable but you know please let me speak and listen to me. So no I'm very much aware of that. You know, when you if you if you're somebody like myself, you watch nature, you watch the the characteristics of animals and you wonder why you get a, you know, like a dog that's going to go to a certain place, it walks around and flattens the grass and moves around in a circle before it lies down and just passes out, right? And you see what what it does. And but they will not sleep in an area where they feel insecure. &gt;&gt; You won't find a dog go and pass out in the middle of the street when there's traffic. or right next to the roadside where everything their ears are going to pop up and the every sound and screech they're going to look for a place that is secure. Right? So that's why I'm saying to show you that your your body reacts very much to what your spirit dictates and your your spirit can push the body to limits. So that's where I was starting with. I don't know why I ended up there. I'm sleeping. But right now, you're in a very relaxed state. If anybody had to tell you, GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR RIGHT NOW AND GIVE ME 10. OH my word, you won't even do one because you're so relaxed right now. Your spirit is telling you, my limit is just peace, relaxation. But if I had to bring in a rabbit dog or a lion just walked in, you people would hop over the railings. You would climb through trees. If you never climbed in your life, if you never jumped higher than 6 ft, you will do it. your spirit immediately would change to that uh fightorflight response and you're going to do things you didn't realize your body would do. And believe me, 2 days later, you are going to feel the pain. &gt;&gt; That's what happens because you've overstretched your tendons. You've overworked your muscle. You're going to feel so tense and so tight and so sore. You're going to need anti-inflammatory and painkillers because this is what your spirit can actually do to your body. It can push you. There's strength in there. So when you look at this, so God felt it necessary that we have to have these seven strengths before we should receive the most important one. Right? Can you imagine a church with all those seven virtues in place? that church would be invincible. That that church would have immeasurable strength. Right? I can tell you in in in 25 years, all right, this is my 25th year in the ministry here in Durban, we have never had a church split. Some of you don't realize what a what a great thing that is. We have not once have we had a split in our church based on doctrine. Do you know how many churches have have had that where a whole chunk of families and people just leave and half the they lose half the church. In 25 years we've never had a church split. And yet in 25 years we've never increased our numbers to 500 to a,000. And of course when you do that when you increase your numbers to great amounts you are heading for splits because if you if you increase your church to those amounts it means you are pushing certain teachings and not telling your church the whole truth. &gt;&gt; Because if you tell the church the whole truth you will never grow in massive numbers. &gt;&gt; That's just the truth. For you to be able to keep thousands and thousands of people in a church, it means you're compromising on truth. You know, just on the way to church here, my boys were asking, we were talking in the car and asking, they were asking me, "How many message believers do you think there are in the world right now?" And I said, "Probably a a few hundred thousand." And they were shocked. He said, "As little as that?" I said, "Yeah." I said, "If you look at from the time of the prophet to about now, maybe it's like a million counting those that have died. I don't know all the exact numbers, but they said to me, when you think about that, are we are we so few?" And it I said, "Yeah, it's it sounds so surreal when you think about it. like why shouldn't the message be a sweeping movement that takes millions that attracts the attention of so many people? So they were asking like so what is our purpose then? &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to be just the influence to others about what the word is? I said, "Well, in in every age or era, if you think about it, when Christ was here, only 12 followed him, &gt;&gt; and there were only 120 out of how many people at that time?" In the time of Noah, how many were there? In the time of of Jacob or Moses, how many were there? They're always a minority, which is actually telling you that people are naturally going to choose to not follow God. So where do we ever get the idea thinking that in the message we're going to get thousands and thousands and thousands or churches with thousands? I can tell you if you are doing that and you are getting massive numbers, you are not telling the truth because it's not congruent with the rest of the Bible. If you are drawing numbers to yourself, you are skimping on the truth. Why? It's, you know how easy it is to do that to get great numbers of people? Cuz if you tell the truth, it's going to get people to be uncomfortable. &gt;&gt; Uh you that's one thing you cannot lie about is the truth is is something that exposes people. And when you expose people, and I don't mean expose people by calling their names. I mean when you expose people in their feelings and their emotions and you make them face what it is that their failures are and their misgivings and their shortcomings, they don't like it. They don't like a Why do you think they hate Christianity? Why do you think the western world, like America, which was founded on Protestantism, &gt;&gt; right now, has a a a culture and a community that is going against Christianity in every single way. &gt;&gt; You've got these people teaching Christianity and yet they have foul words in their mouths. &gt;&gt; They don't even know that it's they think it's cool to swear and to curse and use slang and preach the gospel using those. They they're absolutely unconscious of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And they're the ones supposed to be teaching Christianity to the rest of the world. And this is where we are right now. But yet they have thousands. Thousands more than we have and we'll ever have. Amen. &gt;&gt; They will have the massive churches, the greatest scientific movements, the mass most massive screens, the best music, the best lights, the best uh finances. They'll have the best of everything and no Holy Spirit, no truth. All right? So, in the scripture, there are times when the word I want to show you what the word strength is, why it relates to virtue or ability. Let's go to Acts chapter 9 22. But Paul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus. Now the Jews he's talking about are Jewish believers. Right? He grew more in strength. What strength? Right? It means Paul grew spiritually strong and his ability to teach the word confounded the Jews. You know, this is the thing. What did he confound them with? He confused them. Why did he confuse them? Was he preaching in a confusing way? No. This is another thing. You got people who tell you, "No, brother Alistister, you're not supposed to come here and confuse the people." I didn't confuse the people. I didn't confound them. I just told you the word. &gt;&gt; I didn't preach anything confusing. Why? Why do I know that? Because I can teach the same thing to a child and they get it. What's confusing? You have preconceived ideas of things and systems that you felt worked for you for generations. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Why you're saying you're confused is because you're not willing to accept the truth I just told you. &gt;&gt; And you're claiming to be confounded. &gt;&gt; But he increased in strength. See, notice when virtue increases, the effects are visible. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Hebrews 11. Oh, where are we? Yeah. Hebrews 11:11. Through faith also Sarah received herself received strength to conceive seed. What happened? Was Sarah weak? Did she was she losing iron or what? What strength? She was barren. &gt;&gt; Receiving strength to receive to conceive seed. That means she was healed. Her body had received something. Reset the hormones, the womb, the ovaries, all of that. The pituitary gland, pituitary gland, everything was was reset. Somehow she received strength to conceive seed. Amen. Strength has to do with ability. Are you with us? Let's go to 2 Corinthians uh oh where are we? Romans 5-6. 5 and verse 6. When for when we were yet without strength in due time Christ died for the ungodly. Right. When we had no ability of our own to believe or to have faith, Christ died for us. That's a piece of my notes added in. He made a way knowing that we had no virtue in us to save ourselves. That's what it means by when we were without strength. When we had no ability to save ourselves, &gt;&gt; Christ died for the ungodly. Christ died for the who? The ungodly. 2 Corinthians 12:9, "And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness." Right? Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. This a very confusing scripture, isn't it? Must glory in my weakness, right? Or uh his strength is made perfect in my in weakness. Therefore, when I am weak, he is strong. What does that mean? I'm going just continue backsliding to show how great he is. That's not at all what it means. &gt;&gt; That's not the weakness it's talking about. The weakness is the inability to save yourself. See, a lot of people say, you know, brother, I have this addiction to smoking. It's my weakness. No, smoking is not your weakness. Your weakness is succumbing to smoking. &gt;&gt; Your weakness is the inability to give it up. &gt;&gt; Your weakness is not smoking. Your weakness is not alcohol. Your weakness is not fornication. The weakness is something else. Right? And the weakness is the is the inability to save yourself. The weakness is the inability to say no to something. So that's the weakness. So when you are weak, he is strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, when you don't have the ability to stop it. So don't misidentify the weakness. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't. This is why, you know, when I when I deal with the with the young people and they come to me and they've got issues with sexuality and that when we when we talk about this, they focus on the thing they feel and and this is why they are surprised when they ask you for a solution. What do I do? And then they want the Holy Ghost to take that thing away from them. The Holy Ghost is not going to do that. That thing is going to be there to stay. In fact, the world is going to produce more of it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not going to make that disappear. The problem is your self-will &gt;&gt; is weak. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, what do we need to strengthen the self-will to say no to it? That's where we need to focus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. My strength is made perfect in him uh or in weakness. So, the strength of God is made perfect. And then again what does it mean made perfect? It means my strength or the strength of the word is shown manifested or made complete through your weakness. &gt;&gt; Through your inability my ability can be made made known made manifest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Okay. So his virtue his abilities are made perfect when I show weakness. That's so so when I am at my weakest when the abilities or that I possess are showing weakness it's when the virtues of Christ can be seen right which is one of the reasons why as Christians your your purpose part of your purpose on earth today is to go through the trials Right. A lot of people in the message think today that uh what we have to do for you as a church is protect you is to make sure you come to church. We have to police you. We have to phone you when you don't come to church. We have to make sure you dress a certain way. We have to make sure that you bring up your children that way. we have to um set strong rules to prevent you from uh watching a movie or listening to to worldly music or we must so they feel like that's the job of the church. That's not our job. &gt;&gt; Your duty is to actually go through the trial. &gt;&gt; How can we protect you? How young girl, how can we protect you from a boy who's flirting with you? What must we lock you up in a room? Because that's the best. Just make you see four walls. That's going to protect you from a guy who flirts with you or a a boy, young man. We can protect you. Let's say we protect you all the way through school. Lock you up in a room and never let you see anyone. When you get to work, you're dead. Those women out there are they're coyotes. Let me tell you, they're they're wolves. They're foxes. They're every other kind of name you can think of, men and women. They don't care who you they don't care that you're married. They don't care. They don't care that you're you you have an engagement ring on. To them, they love the game. They're going to try you. And if you have a self-will that folds for the prettiest batting eyes, fluttering eyelids, &gt;&gt; and sweetest voice, you're done for. &gt;&gt; And how do you get to that strength? If you didn't meet all the creeps in school and learn to say no to them, &gt;&gt; you're never going to say no to the creeps when you are working with them. Which means you are going to have to have exercised your faith muscles &gt;&gt; while you were growing. &gt;&gt; This is the problem with keeping your children locked away. &gt;&gt; At the same time, young people be saying, "You see, mom, dad, you're locking me away. You're wrong." At the same time, young people, you don't think you have the strength to go out there in the world. If you're not a child who reads your Bible and studies the message and prays to God and makes a commitment when you get out there to think you can exercise your muscles, the word is telling your muscles are weak. &gt;&gt; His muscles are made strong in your weakness. Which means you need to read the word, pray, be a believer, come to church, be interested in the gospel. Uh you are supposed to be taken in the word. Then you can say I can go out there and exercise my faith muscles. Then mom and dad can trust me. If you don't listen, you know, I am one person who grew up in this message. If there's anybody you should hear from, it's me. I'm not saying this with any pride. I am a person who is exactly what the message preached for us to be. I grew up in this world. I didn't go on backslide. I didn't go into the world. I married my first girlfriend. I uh did not drink, did not smoke, did not swear, did not do all that. Dressed right, did everything right in the eyes of the church. And here I am today still serving God's people. If there's anybody who should actually listen to, it is me &gt;&gt; because I am the product of the message. &gt;&gt; My parents were people who grew up in denominations. They dated other people. They may have drank and smoked and swore and did all those. They they did not even live the life they preached for me to live. So they don't even know how it's done. They only have it in theory. I've done it. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so if you want to know how it's done, I'll tell you how it's done. And it's not done by going to youth camps and and waiting for some supernatural anointing to hit you. It's work. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's work. Don't shy away from it. &gt;&gt; There's no way you're going out there and be like me where I can be out in the world on college campuses playing sport with other people and keeping my testimony. I just I just showed my my my sons yesterday when I was 21 21 I had drawn a diagram with all the chapters and verses of the book of revelations which I then when I became a pastor I drew it out for our church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For us to teach the timeline. Listen young men at 21 I knew the book of Revelations. I knew where the trumpets were, where the vials were. I knew which verse fits with where with every This is what I'm saying. Don't tell me you can you can feel strong enough to go out in the world and think you're just going to do what I did. I put the work in. &gt;&gt; Are you putting the work in? You think, "Mom, dad, I want to go to the metric ball. I want to go to the dance. I want to be there." Have you put the work in? Have you studied the message? You tell me you're going to trust yourself and mom and dad must just trust you. &gt;&gt; When you don't put the work in, you don't study the message. You don't read the church ages. You don't get to know God. You don't pray. &gt;&gt; I went through university and college and did exams and never missed a single service. &gt;&gt; Whether I was writing on Friday or Monday, I was in church on Sunday. I managed my life so I could study and still pass and still be at church. I made no excuses. I put the work in. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I recognized my strength is his strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm never going to defeat the enemy on my own self-will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm never going to defeat the enemy just because my parents brought me up to be a good boy. &gt;&gt; Amen. I knew I have to hide the word of God in my heart. &gt;&gt; That's the only way I'm going to keep myself out there. &gt;&gt; I believe that. That's what works for me till this day. That's what makes me grumpy &gt;&gt; with the world. No matter how much of fun I can have with my children, they just know in my face when something is too liberal. They can see it in my face when something they're doing or something is happening and it's too liberal. They can see it on me because it's never going to agree WITH ME. AND IT'S NOT AGREEING WITH ME. IT'S NOT AGREEING WITH SOMETHING INSIDE ME that I have put inside me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not my strength. It's his strength. &gt;&gt; That's what works. There's no excuses. I'm not preaching youth meetings and having stuff with you guys here just to make you feel good. Oh, don't worry. We understand what you're going through. No, I'm sorry. When you get to 22, 23, 24 and it's time to get married, you need strength. Where did you get it from? Did you put in the work? &gt;&gt; It doesn't say go to a Holy Ghost meeting and he'll add to your faith. It says you add to your faith. &gt;&gt; YOU ADD TO YOUR VIRTUE. YOU ADD TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE. YOU ADD TO YOUR TEMPERANCE. Don't wait for the Holy Ghost TO DO SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING SWITCH IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND then suddenly it pours in. You are not going to get knowledge unless you study. I remember when the message came in and our parents, my mom was reading the message. My mom is like what? She's like 70 years old. She listens to at least three messages a day. At least to this day, she's 70 years old. She might even pass out halfway through something. I don't know. But if she's working in the house, she will listen to a message. And it doesn't mean she's the sweetest person in the world. If you meet her on a bad day, she'll chip you out really bad. But she's listening to the message. No matter what I know, no matter what, she will never stop loving the word. Right. &gt;&gt; During my growing up days, if my mom was working in the house, she would be singing a song, a Christian song, a beautiful hymn, and at the same time, in one second, turn around and shout at me like, "Where did the anointing go?" And then after she's done shouting at me, she's back to singing a song. Right? But my point is all the saints put in the work &gt;&gt; and they are strengths. You have to go out and get them. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no excuses. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Re these are not in my notes. I don't even know why I'm saying all this. Revelations 3:8. I know thy works. Behold, I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it. For thou hast a little strength and has kept my word. Okay. a little strength and has kept my word. The word strength in this scripture in the Greek is dunamis which is the same as virtue. The word little thou has a little strength means a measure or quantity of a certain or particular virtue. In other words, the trials of this is the church age of Philadelphia. These believers had the right amount of a certain virtue to keep the word for their day. So it was in every age. It was not that each age had a great amount of virtue than the previous. It was not that each age had all the previous ages virtues as well. Meaning it doesn't mean that Philadelphia possessed all the virtues of the previous age. Right? They had a little virtue was a new material being laid upon the other. And the elect of each age received the virtue by faith in the message of their day. Right? Which helped them overcome the challenge of their day. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So this virtue or strength was added through the church. This is so beautiful. And I I wish you could understand this. If you knew a little bit about biology, you would know that it takes a lot of things in life that literally adds something to the DNA of a person. It's like intelligence gets coded into it, &gt;&gt; right? So like for example, uh there's a lot of things you do today that occurred because thousands of years ago your ancestors did things like they learned about dangers. They learned how to cook using certain materials. They learned how to use stone. Like nowadays, you will you you become a a 2-year-old. You're born, you're 2 years old, and you're doing something. You don't know why you're doing it, but it it happened 4,000 years ago in your ancestors. &gt;&gt; And you may not know, but you're looking at something and it's a bug and you know not to eat it. You don't know why, but back then it was encoded by some behavioral change into your DNA. And in you right there, the spirits of your forefathers are speaking to you through your DNA and telling you, "Do not eat that. It's poison." &gt;&gt; You recognize it. Why am I saying this? Because you had a bunch of heathens, Gentiles, pagans, idol worshippers, and through the church ages, through the gospel, &gt;&gt; virtues were being installed. &gt;&gt; Amen. literally into the DNA, which is why the people of this world went from 4,000 years of absolute mayhem, and here comes this man who dies on the cross, rose again. A legend was written about, some people say he didn't even exist. Some people said he wasn't even crucified. But for a guy who didn't exist or wasn't crucified to change the whole world in under 2,000 years did a great job &gt;&gt; changing wild fighting violent nations into peaceful people who want democracies &gt;&gt; and constitutions written on moral values and people's rights and all of that. Where did they think they got that from? And now it's literally encoded into that DNA. Right? Through study of the church ages, we can see that each virtue in each age came into the church through each messengers's message. Now, I love it because if you read the book of Revelations, it tells you about the sevenfold glory of his person. Sevenfold attributes. You can tie it all in. Like for example, his hair is white as wool. His eyes is a flame of fire. His feet is fine brass. His voice is the sound of many waters. &gt;&gt; All attributes and you can find them. They are the divine attributes of the capstone. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Which we will get to some other time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As the last age ended, the new one began. And the first thing that happened is God allowed a certain spirit of the enemy to rise up in the church which required a virtue of God to be unveiled. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To counter that. &gt;&gt; Right. So when the people learned what it took to counter that, it now become recorded in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they knew how if this came up again, they knew how to deal with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so it was passed down. See, that's how they were building blocks. &gt;&gt; Amen. of the church. &gt;&gt; So at the last age now the same thing happened. The new age began and we learned from the from the mistakes. We saw the spirit that challenged it, right? And God allowed that spirit of the enemy to come in so the people could experience it. This the thing you have to experience it. So we're not against we're not against people disagreeing with us. We have to experience that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We're not against people calling us names. We're not against people sledging us or you know uh coming against us or calling us cult. We have to go through that. &gt;&gt; We have to face it and we have to overcome that and we need a certain character. What's the right thing to do? Like you've got people on the internet going against the prophet. What's the right thing to do? Do we create another uh system to fight back against them? Some people might think that's the right thing to do. Do do we do nothing about it and just say, "Well, let's just forget about them. Let's just continue as normal. What's the right thing to do? What's the right spirit? What's the right strength at this time? It has to be seen somewhere." Amen. So then just when it seems like when when all is lost and the age is suffering with the spirit of the enemy that's rising, God sends a messenger and a messenger comes with a message that breaks open something to show the correct strength against that and the people accept it and they destroy it. They overcome it. Right? So it was important however to to bring out each virtue in those seen angels so that the maturity of the church would be at its fullness to receive the virtue of God himself at the end which is divine love. Let's go to blasphemous names. Then when we have met these qualifications and become full of the virtues of God and the things of God then the Holy Spirit comes down and seals us into the kingdom. Don't worry now everybody will know you got it. I love that. Everybody will know you've got it. You won't have to say, "Well, glory to God. I know I got it. I spoke with tongues. Glory to God. I know I got it. I danced the spirit once." You don't have to say a word about it. Everybody will know you got it. Don't you worry. It will testify for itself. He'll let it be known among men. How will everybody know you got it? Hm. Because they know what the challenge of the hour is and they can see you are defeating it. See when you add uh virtue, strength or power for your age, it produces the right character. The strength and ability that people gain from the messenger's word was unmistakable. Like uh I I'll show it to you this way. Let's take the dark ages, right? the thousand years of dark ages when they were rounding up the Christians, putting them in the circus of Rome and letting the lions and bears eat them and these people instead of fighting back just stood there and praised God. Do you know what the circus of Rome was about? Entertainment. &gt;&gt; People wanted to see these people crying and running and screaming and please HELP MERCY AND CRY FOR MERCY AND Caesar would stand up. Should we give them mercy? And the people will go no that's what they love they love this blood and gore and nonsense they enjoy this and then the people some people will feel sorry and see should we give them mercy and THE PEOPLE SAY YES that's what this whole thing was about &gt;&gt; you know what the believers did totally spoiled their fun the believers just stood there didn't ask for mercy they just started singing and praising God they were killed by the animals and gladiators. They wouldn't even pick up the swords to fight. They just stood there and said, "We give our lives freely." &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? This was so unentertaining. The people standing there, I want my money back. Right? This this is not WE WHAT WE PAID FOR. THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST DYING WILLFULLY. WHAT'S WHAT'S UP WITH THEM? &gt;&gt; This was the Ox age anointing &gt;&gt; meeting the challenge of the day. Don't play for them. Incredible. That's just one way, right? History recorded it. The people saw it and the enemy was always defeated. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So the enemy had to come up with a way now to combat that. Say this is not working. You know what was happening in those circuses of Rome? The people in the stands started being converted by these people &gt;&gt; and this was backfiring on the Roman government. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then they decided, "No, this is not working. We got to deal with them outside. They are converting thousands of people here. This isn't right." &gt;&gt; Would you have thought that's the right strength? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I mean, right there you got this ferocious starved lion racing at you to eat you. In that moment, do you think, "Wow, I need to exercise my moral vessel. Let's do a bit of meditation right here. Let him eat me." &gt;&gt; Never. You will never come up with that on your own. In that moment of weakness, it's going to be his strength. &gt;&gt; Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Don't worry. It'll testify for itself. He'll let it be known among men. You don't have to brag about it. You don't have to say this happened to ME ON THIS DATE. I WAS WEARING THIS CLOTHES and this COLORED TIE AND HE HIT ME LIKE A LIGHTNING BOLT AND I SPOKE WITH TONGUES. You better keep that testimony forever, my friend, cuz you make that testimony and you're going to have to make it last. &gt;&gt; All right. So the seven virtues saints are seven strengths or abilities that can build back the divine nature of man to what he once possessed in the garden of Eden. All right, I'm closing. Uh so this is what I want to draw you to right now. When people look at these seven virtues and this is why I'm I want to show you in closing conclude this this out is that people who thought that this is the seven thunders and these were seven mysteries seven so mysterious things faith virtue knowledge temp they're so mysterious they had to be spoken by the thunders and why it's wrong is because these are not natures of God &gt;&gt; they are the original natures of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That was corrupted and have to be restored before the capstone descends on you. &gt;&gt; In other words, had there been no sin, you would have possessed them &gt;&gt; in whatever was necessary. &gt;&gt; Right? So, what is faith? This isn't the faith of God that framed the worlds. &gt;&gt; Everybody has faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know some of you people with anxiety you also have faith maybe a little but you have some right you trust in your anxiousness. You have faith in your anxiety to keep you safe. That's still faith. Faith is is a is something that men have men and women have to make them believe in something without evidence. All of you do that. All of you use that. All of you exercise that. Am I right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's in everything you do, you exercise a little bit of faith. Not one of you will say to me, "Well, I was sick and there was this cough mixture and I spent a whole year studying it before I bought it." Nobody. You will hear, you will call a friend, you will call a relative, you will listen to the doctor, you hear what the doctor says. You will even make the stupid decision based on how the doctor smiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the doctor said, "Don't worry. Trust me. I've been a doctor for 50 years. This works." And you'll be like looking at your husband 50 years. He must know what he's talking about. Let's buy it based on that. Oh, this one or I saw this on YouTube. I saw this on Tik Tok or that or that. Please do not tell me you've done due diligence and done all the investigations necessary. At some point your investigations ran out and you took it by faith, &gt;&gt; right? Everybody, every human acts majority of the time on faith &gt;&gt; because nobody has the time to go find all the evidence. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not faith, it's just hoping. Let's take it and hope it works. Right? The point is there are natures of man that has been corrupted. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Even faith itself is corrupted because faith in the wrong thing is corrupt faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like people who will actually trust in a lie and stake their claim on a lie. &gt;&gt; They have had corrupted faith. They were unable to see through the lie and recognize that they need to to change their idea about this. Right? So all those attributes they are attributes of man. Virtue is an attribute of man. Knowledge is an attribute of man. Temperance is an attribute of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why does God need temperance? Temperance is self-control. Why is that a godly attribute? Self-control. Does God ever need self-control? Does God ever need patience? H Does God need to exercise patience? Come on, people. Is time affecting God? Oh, I need to endure. Does God need to endure? How about godliness? Does God need godliness? Huh? This is a this is the thing. So when we say they are attributes of the Holy Spirit or something like that, THE HOLY SPIRIT AGAIN IS SOMETHING RELATED to man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, so first before we get to the actual divine attribute meant to cap mankind, you have to have all those other attributes restored to its original. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the building blocks are about. We've got to have true faith in the right thing. How could you have faith unless Christ was born, died, and rose again? How could you have faith toward true righteousness unless God became a man and showed you what true faith is? &gt;&gt; How could you have faith in a word unless that word was tested? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So, here's what happened. In the garden of Eden, man was once divine in the flesh. He was divine. He had the nature that was fit to rule. This is important to understand which will tell us why they are not the seven thunders. They are divine human natures, not the celestial nature of God. Trust me, when we get through each one, like brother said, we'll take faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience. We'll get through each one. We'll study it out and then you can decide and tell me whether this is like a nature of God. Can you if he says add to your faith, everyone starts there faith, right? When you start off, do you have the faith of God that framed the worlds? Do you? And at what point do you get it and then add to your faith virtue? None of us ever have the faith to create a planet. &gt;&gt; So that's not the faith you're looking to. &gt;&gt; I mean, you're barely struggling to have faith to create an outbuilding at the back of your house or a dog kennel nailed up perfectly at 90° angles or some kind of thing that you're creating at home. Not enough faith. Is that right? You know, I tell my kids Poor human society, I tell you. We got to We constantly have to reward ourselves with food, you know. Uh here I I bought the kennel, honey. I'm going to build a kennel because I bought it. I need to reward myself with food. Let's go have some cheesecake, you know? Then I get through like quarter of it. Look how well I did. Let's have some more cheesecake cuz I'm doing so well. Rewarding myself, giving myself some dopamine. Then I I finished the thing, but it's slightly skewed. Don't worry, honey. We still tried. Let's go have some cheesecake. Hey, we got to reward ourselves. No matter how good or bad we do, no matter what or how how things go, we must still reward ourselves. This is human nature. It's all messed up, right? This is important, saints. They are divine natures of human beings. God doesn't need godliness, patience or temperance. He is perfect. He is not part of time. &gt;&gt; He does not have to endure anything. He does not need to exercise patient. If if God became impatient with us, there's something wrong with him. Cuz how could he be impatient when he already knows we were going to do that? &gt;&gt; He's he's got four knowledge. So how can he have impatience? True. His endurance with us is not about his endurance. It's about our It's about his longsuffering because we are so complacent. Right? God respects your choice. As a church, we are only safe and ready to completely destroy the enemy in the presence of our husband, Christ. In Eden, the woman fell in the absence of her capstone. Amen. &gt;&gt; She fell in the absence of her husband. &gt;&gt; So if you don't if you don't even get capped with that capstone, all that you built up, you will still fall by. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's how we know it's not the seven thunders. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect. &gt;&gt; Because she had everything. She even had contact with the theophony. BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF HER HUSBAND, she was wooed by a different capstone that corrupted whatever nature she had and took it out, stripped it away from her. &gt;&gt; Which is why though you are built up by all the word of the messengers, the Holy Spirit has to seal that in and the capstone come on to perfect it. And now it's sealed in place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we are living in the day when the capstone has to descend. That's what the seven seal must do. Yes, &gt;&gt; it must become something personal to you that brings the capsule down, connects you to your husband. When he is present, then the virtue of God himself is produced in us. Divine agape love. But it is important that we go through the entire building process. Saints, to close us off, you couldn't have come out of Egypt, crossed over the Red Sea, and start having a revival that you were in the promised land. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you couldn't. You had to walk through the wilderness journey. You had to meet every step. You had to meet Kora Day. You had to meet uh the the waters of Mara. You had to go through the the quailes issue. You had to go through all the trials before you get to the place where you get into the promised land. You can't stop there and say now I'm ready for the seventh seal to be open. That's why it's not even a global instantaneous happening. Each one of us are going through our steps, &gt;&gt; our own personal growth. &gt;&gt; And at that time, YOU CAN BE SITTING in the same church under our ministry. And I was preaching the seven seal 20 years ago. It doesn't mean because I preached it 20 years ago, you've got it. &gt;&gt; You still have to come through your personal growth UNTIL THAT WHICH I PREACHED 20 YEARS AGO becomes a reality to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not bringing messages to tell you you're you're slowing us down. You're not worth it. You're getting into slow. You're not getting into No. If we preach like that, it means we don't even understand what we're preaching. &gt;&gt; Everybody is growing according to how God is revealing himself to them. &gt;&gt; You don't ever have to worry about being behind someone or you only came into the message a few years ago. Trust me, we're not going anywhere without you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a beautiful part of this thing. I I often hear brothers, you know, tell me, wonderful, sincere brothers, ministers saying, you know, brother, how do we catch up? I don't even think of you having to catch up. What do what do you have to catch up with? How much we know how we can teach something? All you have to do is listen, believe, and trust God. &gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT AND ACT on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to do anything. It'll testify for itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll let it be known among men. Just let it become real to you. Listen to the word, believe it, and act on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's where the church fails. I I've actually got quotes that I've, &gt;&gt; you know, going to Brother Maron says, "People believe." I think we read some of it on on Wednesday. People believe and stop there. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the issue right now with the right now with message churches. That's the issue because we preach the word, we take you to camps, you get the Holy Ghost, and then we bring you to church and and you do nothing. &gt;&gt; You're never meant to do nothing. &gt;&gt; You have to act on the word &gt;&gt; because that is going to produce the virtue. The virtue that's going to lead you to the building blocks that builds you up to become that holy temple which he can cap. These are seven steps to perfection. Then he seals everything with the Holy Ghost at the end and brings his own divine nature, celestial heavenly divine nature which is the capstone to come down upon. Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads together. Amen.
