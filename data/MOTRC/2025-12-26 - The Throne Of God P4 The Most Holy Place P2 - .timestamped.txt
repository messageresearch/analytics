[0:01] I greet you all in the wonderful name of
[0:02] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And
[0:05] once again, a real privilege to be
[0:07] speaking the word of the Lord to the to
[0:10] the bride people of God who he has saved
[0:14] by his grace and brought us to the glory
[0:18] of this message. It's really um been the
[0:22] privilege of my life to be serving God's
[0:25] people and I trust that you have been
[0:28] blessed by the word and constantly
[0:31] living in it. And we are getting into a
[0:35] beautiful subject today
[0:38] which uh really has blessed my soul.
[0:41] We're dealing with the throne of God
[0:45] and this is part four and we're dealing
[0:48] with the most holy place part two and
[0:52] we're going to be talking about the ark
[0:54] of the covenant. So that's our subject.
[0:56] And for the title, the Lord's presence,
[1:01] we're going to begin with the scripture
[1:02] reading from Exodus chapter 25 verse 10
[1:06] to 11 and also verse 16-22.
[1:13] And they shall make an ark out of shitim
[1:16] wood. Two cubits and a half shall be the
[1:19] length thereof, and a cubit and a half
[1:21] the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a
[1:24] half the height thereof. And thou shalt
[1:27] overlay it with pure gold, within and
[1:30] without shalt thou lay it, and shall
[1:33] make upon it a crown of gold roundabout.
[1:37] Verse 16.
[1:40] And thou shalt put into the ark the
[1:42] testimony which I shall give thee. And
[1:46] thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure
[1:48] gold. Two cubits and a half shall be the
[1:51] length thereof, and a cubit and a half
[1:54] the breath thereof. And thou shalt make
[1:57] two cherubams of gold. Of beaten work
[2:00] shalt thou make them in the two ends of
[2:02] the mercy seat. and make one cherub on
[2:06] the one end and the other cherub on the
[2:09] other end.
[2:10] Even of the mercy seat shall you make
[2:12] the cherubams on the two ends thereof.
[2:16] And the cherubams shall stretch forth
[2:18] their wings and high covering the mercy
[2:21] seat with their wings, and their faces
[2:24] shall look one to another. Toward the
[2:28] mercy seat shall the faces of the
[2:30] cherubams be. And thou shalt put the
[2:33] mercy seat upon above upon the ark, and
[2:36] in the ark shalt thou put the testimony
[2:40] that I shall give thee. And there I will
[2:43] meet with thee, and I will commune with
[2:46] thee from above the mercy seat, from
[2:49] between the two cherubams, which are
[2:51] upon the ark of the testimony,
[2:54] of all things which I will give thee in
[2:56] commandment unto the children of Israel.
[3:01] May the Lord add a blessing to the word
[3:02] of God.
[3:05] So we have started in this series to
[3:07] focus on the most holy place first.
[3:12] We want to examine the innermost part of
[3:15] the tabernacle first and then move
[3:17] outwards.
[3:20] So looking at the most holy place, there
[3:23] is one piece of furniture inside and
[3:26] that is the ark of the covenant.
[3:29] It was called the ark of the covenant or
[3:32] the ark of the testimony. The testimony
[3:36] meaning the law
[3:38] and the ark of the lord was also called
[3:41] the ark of the lord. There was a lot of
[3:44] mystery around this little wooden box
[3:47] overlaid with gold that troubled the
[3:50] Canaanites in the age of Moses and
[3:52] Joshua.
[3:54] Why was this ark so mysterious? And what
[3:57] was so special about it that it needed
[3:59] to be protected and kept the way it was
[4:03] on the move and even when it was at
[4:06] rest. For those of you who would have
[4:08] read the scriptures, you would know that
[4:12] this ark was wrapped in cloth scarlet
[4:16] and skins
[4:19] and uh was and had to be carried by the
[4:22] priesthood on their shoulders.
[4:24] And
[4:26] when the ark was moving, all the people
[4:29] had to be packed and also moving.
[4:33] And when they stopped, the first thing
[4:36] they would do is put the ark in a place
[4:39] chosen for the tabernacle. They would
[4:41] build the most holy place around the
[4:43] ark.
[4:44] Then they would take the coverings off
[4:47] the ark because the ark was now sealed
[4:49] from the public view. Then they would
[4:52] build the inner court out and then place
[4:55] the furniture in. And then lastly, they
[4:57] would build the outer court around that.
[5:00] So they would start from the inside
[5:02] moving outwards.
[5:05] And then when they would pack up to
[5:08] leave again, they would start from the
[5:10] outside breaking everything down,
[5:13] removing the outer court, removing the
[5:16] inner court, and finally removing the
[5:19] most holy place. But just before moving
[5:21] the most holy place, they would cover
[5:23] the ark completely so that it would be
[5:25] blocked from view of the public.
[5:28] It was always kept in a mysterious way.
[5:32] So only when it was required for the
[5:36] public to see it was at times like the
[5:39] battle of Jericho and so on when um the
[5:43] presence of the Lord had to be felt by
[5:46] the enemy and so on. So we're going to
[5:49] get to talk to some of talk about some
[5:52] of these things um a little later.
[5:56] So again, why was this ark so mysterious
[5:59] and what was so special about it that it
[6:02] needed to be protected?
[6:04] Uh either when it was on the move or
[6:06] when it was at rest. So firstly, the
[6:10] word ark in English word
[6:14] uh and in the original Hebrew, it simply
[6:17] means a chest or a coffer. Coffer is an
[6:21] English word from where you also get the
[6:24] word coffin.
[6:26] So a coffer is basically a box that you
[6:31] can preserve something precious in a box
[6:35] that you put treasure in. So ark simply
[6:39] means a box that you can preserve
[6:42] something precious within.
[6:46] Now
[6:48] hold that in your mind because when we
[6:50] talk about how this applies to us then
[6:54] this is very important to understand.
[6:57] There are many things that happened that
[6:59] we know about the ark in the Bible. So
[7:04] if you followed the story of this ark uh
[7:07] from the time of its creation till the
[7:09] time of Christ uh you find many things
[7:13] that took place with that. For example,
[7:15] I'm I'm just going to put uh eight
[7:17] points down
[7:19] uh for a particular reason.
[7:23] Numbers 10 and 33-36.
[7:26] Point number one, in Numbers 10:33-36,
[7:30] when Israel was unsure of their way, the
[7:33] ark went before them.
[7:36] Number two, Joshua 3. When Israel
[7:39] crossed the river Jordan, the ark went
[7:41] before them and stood still in the midst
[7:43] of the river. The waters parted at the
[7:46] presence of the ark. After all the
[7:48] people had crossed, the ark was carried
[7:50] to the other shore. Then the waters
[7:52] closed again.
[7:55] Number three, in Joshua 6, the ark went
[7:58] before them at the downfall of Jericho.
[8:02] six times. Six days, one time around uh
[8:07] Jericho and on the seventh day, seven
[8:10] times around Jericho, and the ark went
[8:13] before them.
[8:15] Number four, 1st Samuel 4:6 and 7.
[8:18] Neighboring nations thought that the ark
[8:21] was the God of Israel because of how the
[8:24] people shout in praise when the ark came
[8:28] into sight.
[8:30] Number five, 1st Samuel 5:7. The
[8:33] Philistines capture the ark after
[8:35] defeating Israel, but soon were relieved
[8:39] to be rid of it after 7 days.
[8:44] 2 Samuel 6. Usuza is killed when he
[8:48] touches the ark while trying to save it
[8:51] from falling.
[8:53] Number seven, 2 Samuel 6. David strips
[8:57] off his kingly garments and dances
[9:00] before the ark as it enters Jerusalem.
[9:04] And number eight, the ark was not seen
[9:07] again after the temple was destroyed by
[9:10] the Babylonians.
[9:12] But people of all other religions had
[9:14] already began to have their own chests
[9:17] or arks which became idols and soon the
[9:21] ark of the testimony was just deemed
[9:24] another idol. In fact, this is not in my
[9:28] notes, but you can read it in the
[9:29] histories. They developed the countries
[9:32] around developed what was called an ark
[9:36] cult because Israel was carrying this
[9:40] ark. Other nations decided to do similar
[9:43] things and built up things like this and
[9:47] mysterious looking things as arcs to
[9:50] their gods and so on. So, it became a
[9:52] bit of an arc cult during that time.
[9:56] Now, from the time the ark was created,
[9:58] it was never meant to be an idol. It was
[10:01] only meant to be a symbol of the
[10:04] presence of the Lord. What does that
[10:06] mean? That means that the ark was built
[10:11] to make the people recognize the
[10:14] presence of the Lord. So that when the
[10:16] ark was seen, the people were conscious.
[10:21] And this would only be necessary because
[10:24] people's minds always drift and it seems
[10:28] to be the nature of fallen humans that
[10:32] they get so busy with their lives that
[10:34] they tend to forget that the Lord is
[10:37] present.
[10:38] So this ark was meant to be a reminder
[10:42] of the presence of the Lord to bring
[10:44] people's attention that he is here.
[10:47] Behave yourself wisely and so on.
[10:50] Now when people began to idolize this
[10:54] ark, it lost its effectiveness in the
[10:57] later years of its manifestation. So
[11:00] because of ark cults going on and the
[11:03] way Israel handled this ark and how they
[11:07] eventually revered it so much,
[11:11] um they took an obsession to it and they
[11:16] went overboard with this um belief in
[11:20] the ark in in the sense of idolizing the
[11:24] ark and forgetting the symbolism.
[11:27] Now there is scriptural proof for that
[11:29] because the ark lost its significance
[11:32] and its effectiveness.
[11:34] When I say that I mean it failed to work
[11:37] in the favor of Israel in the later
[11:40] years of its manifestation. So I want to
[11:43] show you the scriptural proof and just
[11:45] to tell you about it before we get
[11:46] there. In 1st Samuel 4 when Israel went
[11:49] out to fight the Philistines, they
[11:51] became so confident when the ark was
[11:54] brought in amongst them. Uh that is the
[11:56] Israelites became confident when the ark
[11:58] was brought in amongst them. And then
[12:00] the Philistines were terrified cuz they
[12:03] heard the people of Israel shouting and
[12:05] they knew that the ark was there among
[12:07] them. But the very same day the uh the
[12:11] the the people of Israel were defeated
[12:14] by the Philistines and the ark was taken
[12:16] captive. So the question is why didn't
[12:19] it work for them? So let's read 1st
[12:21] Samuel 4 2:4.
[12:24] And the Philistines put themselves in
[12:26] array against Israel.
[12:29] And when they joined the battle, Israel
[12:32] was smitten before the Philistines, and
[12:34] they slew with the army in the field
[12:35] about 4,000 men. And when the people
[12:38] were coming to the camp, the elders of
[12:40] Israel said, "Wherefore hath the Lord
[12:42] smitten us today before the Philistines?
[12:45] Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of
[12:47] the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that
[12:51] when it cometh among us, it may save us
[12:54] out of the hand of our enemies. Now,
[12:56] watch their motive for bringing the ark.
[12:59] They were losing the battle to the
[13:01] Philistines. They were not asking the
[13:03] question, why are we losing to the
[13:05] Philistines
[13:07] right now?
[13:10] The solution, this is so uh common to
[13:14] fallen man. The solution they felt was
[13:17] to bring the ark out of Shiloh
[13:21] among their army because they believed
[13:23] that that would help them defeat the
[13:26] enemy.
[13:28] Verse four. So the people sent to Shiloh
[13:31] that they might bring from then the ark
[13:34] of the covenant of the Lord of hosts
[13:36] which dwelleth between the cherubams and
[13:39] the two sons of Eli Hoffne and Phineas
[13:42] were there with the ark of the covenant
[13:44] of God.
[13:46] So if you follow the the scriptures,
[13:49] you'll realize that this was the end of
[13:52] the days of the judges and Eli's sons
[13:54] Hoffne and Finez were already a corrupt
[13:58] ministry.
[13:59] Uh and the Lord was going to judge the
[14:01] house of Eli and Eli was a type of
[14:04] Pentecost. So you can actually see uh in
[14:07] types which we will not get into now but
[14:10] that Pentecost had brought the ark out
[14:15] of its original position and where it
[14:17] should be. And when they brought this
[14:19] ark out they were expecting it to save
[14:22] them as it had done before. But they had
[14:25] brought it out of the tabernacle which
[14:28] was not the will of God.
[14:31] So when the ark came in and the people
[14:34] saw the ark, they worshiped God, they
[14:37] praised so loudly, they shouted so
[14:40] loudly that they frightened the the
[14:42] Philistines. And the Philistines were
[14:44] terrified.
[14:45] Right? Let's read 1st Samuel 4:6 to8.
[14:49] And when the Philistines heard the noise
[14:51] of the shout, they said, "What meanth
[14:54] the noise of this great shout in the
[14:55] camp of the Hebrews? And they understood
[14:59] that the ark of the Lord was come into
[15:01] the camp. That means they were made
[15:03] aware like spies were had gotten there
[15:07] and told them the ark of the covenant
[15:09] has come into the camp. Verse 7. And the
[15:11] Philistines were afraid for they said
[15:15] God is come into the camp and they said
[15:19] woe unto us for there hath not been such
[15:22] a thing here to fall. That means
[15:24] something like this has never happened
[15:26] to us before.
[15:28] Verse eight, woe unto us who shall
[15:31] deliver us out of the hand of these
[15:33] mighty gods. These are the gods that
[15:36] smokeote the Egyptians with all the
[15:38] plagues in the in the wilderness.
[15:41] So I want you to see something. The
[15:43] enemy recognized and respected the
[15:46] presence of God. When the enemy saw the
[15:49] ark of the covenant coming into the camp
[15:51] of Israel, the enemy recognized the
[15:54] symbolism of the ark, the enemy
[15:58] recognized the presence of God, right?
[16:02] And yet Israel was still defeated that
[16:06] day. Now, this was really confusing for
[16:09] Israel because of their immaturity.
[16:12] Much like the people today in the
[16:14] message, this shows us that the ark is
[16:17] only meant to be a symbol to bring
[16:20] revelation but not to be idolized.
[16:25] Right? By idolizing it, they lost the
[16:28] awareness of the presence of God and
[16:30] they lost the battle. Right?
[16:34] On the other hand, the Philistines
[16:37] recognized the presence of God in the
[16:39] ark and it caused them to fight with
[16:42] more revelation and they won obviously.
[16:46] So the ark cannot be used for
[16:49] convenience. It will not produce the
[16:51] results you desire. See with the
[16:55] Israelites by idolizing it they lost the
[16:58] awareness of the presence of God.
[17:00] Listen, what what was supposed to have
[17:02] happened when the Israelites came to
[17:05] battle the Philistines, they should have
[17:07] realized, we don't need to bring the ark
[17:10] among us because we recognize the
[17:12] presence of God already among us.
[17:16] So they brought the ark
[17:19] away from Shiloh to themselves because
[17:22] they could not see the presence of God
[17:25] among themselves and that was the
[17:27] problem.
[17:30] So let's talk about the symbolism of the
[17:33] tabernacle and the ark here. Now every
[17:35] part of the tabernacle of Moses was
[17:37] meant to be symbolic of something. And
[17:39] that's where our series is taking us.
[17:42] And every part of the tabernacle of
[17:44] Moses was symbolic, but it was never
[17:46] meant to become something that was made
[17:49] into an idol. It was never made they
[17:52] were never made to be idol. So not not
[17:54] the candlesticks, not the showbread,
[17:56] table of showbread, not the altars. None
[17:59] of the things that pertain to the
[18:02] tabernacle should have become idols. For
[18:04] example, the ephit, we know that becomes
[18:07] an idol later uh in the time of the
[18:10] judges. So if the Israelites were
[18:14] supposed to see the significance of
[18:16] every symbol
[18:19] of the tabernacle, then how much more
[18:21] us? If we look at this tabernacle.
[18:25] Now, um, for those of you who read the
[18:27] book of Hebrews, you will see that Paul
[18:30] takes, um, several chapters to explain
[18:33] the symbolism of the tabernacle in the
[18:36] wilderness. And then he types it into
[18:38] Christ to show how all that they had in
[18:41] the tabernacle,
[18:44] we've seen in Christ. Okay? So, I'm
[18:47] going to get into that much later in
[18:50] this series, but I just want to bring to
[18:52] your attention that we need to see the
[18:55] much more in the symbolism than Israel
[18:58] was supposed to recognize in their day.
[19:01] Right? So, it was not meant to be
[19:04] worshiped or idolized, but recognized as
[19:07] the presence of God. That's what the ark
[19:10] was meant to be to the children of
[19:12] Israel. Now, understanding this brings a
[19:15] better understanding of the Lord Jesus's
[19:18] position in the Godhead.
[19:20] Everything in a tabernacle pointed to
[19:23] Christ, to him. In him, in Christ, we
[19:27] see the courts, the veil, the altars,
[19:30] the table of showbread, the
[19:32] candlesticks, the priesthood, the
[19:35] prophet, the sacrifice, the blood of the
[19:37] sacrifice, the labor, the the water in
[19:40] the labor, the shakina glory of the
[19:42] Lord, and the ark. When we look at
[19:45] Christ, we see the entire tabernacle in
[19:48] this one man. Amen.
[19:52] Now looking at him as the ark,
[19:56] we can see how that not all who claim to
[19:59] have him or know him will have God
[20:02] amongst them the way they would like to.
[20:06] Just like the Israelites and then later
[20:08] the Philistines, right? What am I
[20:11] saying? You've got people in this world
[20:14] who claim to have Christ. Okay? But if
[20:18] they don't have Christ where he's
[20:20] supposed to be,
[20:22] they can claim to have Christ among
[20:25] their armies and still be destroyed and
[20:28] defeated spiritually. I mean, right? And
[20:32] then, of course, you know the story with
[20:33] the Philistines. They took the ark into
[20:35] their cities. They put the ark in their
[20:38] um
[20:40] uh greatest temple and they the next day
[20:44] they came back and their god was falling
[20:46] flat on his face and they're also
[20:50] um they all started developing a
[20:53] disease, a terrible disease and they
[20:56] realized it was because this ark was
[20:58] there with them and the only way they
[21:00] were going to be healed was to get rid
[21:02] of this ark from them. Which means these
[21:05] heathens recognized that the ark was not
[21:07] in its rightful place. And because it
[21:10] was not in its rightful place, it was
[21:12] doing things that were unexpected and
[21:14] not what they desired. And they realized
[21:17] it has to go back to its normal place or
[21:20] else mankind is going to be in trouble.
[21:23] Right?
[21:25] So in the same way with Christ, Christ
[21:27] cannot be idolized as the denominations
[21:30] did, as the Catholic Church did. They
[21:33] made him an idol. Look at this.
[21:34] Crucifixes, pictures, stained glass
[21:38] windows,
[21:39] um, statues of Christ. They have turned
[21:42] Christ into an idol. And when you do
[21:45] that, he loses he who he is. That
[21:49] effectiveness of who he is is lost to
[21:52] mankind and eventually hurts them and
[21:56] causes them to become defeated. Right?
[22:01] So we need to understand that he was to
[22:04] be recognized as the presence of the
[22:07] Lord or that God had come, that Messiah
[22:12] had come or that God was present in him.
[22:17] Amen. But if he was the ark, then what
[22:21] was it about him that made him an ark?
[22:24] Why was he an ark? What does it take to
[22:27] be an ark? Notice brother Vandom teaches
[22:30] us that the ark always represented the
[22:33] word. We can apply it in crossing the
[22:36] Jordan in many other places. But how
[22:38] does it apply in our day? That's what we
[22:41] want to see. Let's go to this message
[22:43] blind bottomas preached 1956 14th of
[22:46] April and paragraph 23 says oh I
[22:51] remember when I was a little boy mother
[22:53] taking me down there one day and showing
[22:55] me these stones that they taken up the
[22:57] bearers of the ark the ones that
[22:59] followed pick it up picked up stones and
[23:01] laid them on the ground and there there
[23:03] yet or if I would have only lived then
[23:06] wouldn't that have been wonderful if I
[23:07] could lived in the day when those great
[23:10] god took this pillar of by and crossed
[23:11] over the Jordan and the ark of the Lord
[23:15] representing the word come behind the
[23:18] spirit and word together. What a great
[23:22] thing that was. But well, those days are
[23:24] gone. They tell me miracles don't happen
[23:26] no more. And how I remember how she used
[23:28] to tell me that some glorious day we'd
[23:30] be visiting again. But oh, it must be
[23:32] way in the future. Maybe my great great
[23:34] great grandchildren might see it. But
[23:36] not I, a poor blind beggar. when that
[23:39] great mighty Messiah shall set his feet
[23:41] on the earth. Little did he know that
[23:43] within 150 yards he was standing. That's
[23:46] what I think tonight. Many of you try to
[23:49] wonder as brother Brandham saying
[23:51] someday somewhere but that Messiah isn't
[23:54] 5 ft away from you tonight right here
[23:57] with you. So there are some important
[23:59] important things uh to notice here.
[24:02] First is that the ark is a symbol of the
[24:05] word. Notice brother Ram says the ark of
[24:07] the Lord representing the word. And then
[24:10] he said the pillar of fire going across
[24:12] over Jordan. The ark representing the
[24:14] word. He speaks of the spirit and the
[24:17] word being together. Now this is very
[24:19] important. This pillar of fire and this
[24:21] ark are connected. Right?
[24:25] So um the pillar of fire moved with the
[24:29] ark. That's the beautiful part of the
[24:31] symbol here. Brother Graham said it's
[24:33] the spirit and the word moving together.
[24:38] Spirit and the word moves together. Take
[24:40] note of that saints. So we know that the
[24:42] pillar of fire in the Bible is the logos
[24:46] or the spoken word form of God
[24:50] or the spirit form of the word. Now
[24:55] lastly, recognizing the presence of the
[24:57] Lord was always a problem for man. In
[25:02] Christ's day, they could not see him
[25:04] when he was just a few yards away. So
[25:07] will it be today. The same Messiah is
[25:10] unrecognized when he's standing amongst
[25:12] us because we cannot see or recognize
[25:16] the ark in our day. That's because
[25:19] people fail to see the ark in their day.
[25:22] They cannot identify it because so many
[25:24] people have made their own arcs.
[25:28] Amen. In this message trying to do God a
[25:31] service u paragraph 83 preached 1965
[25:35] 18th of July brother Brandon said notice
[25:38] the ark was the word.
[25:40] We know that's right cuz the ark is
[25:43] Christ and Christ is the word. the ark
[25:46] or the word was not put in its first
[25:50] ordained original ordained position or
[25:53] don't fail to get this church. All
[25:55] right? So notice this. The ark is
[25:58] ineffective. So brother Venom says the
[26:00] ark or the word was not put in its first
[26:03] ordained original ordained position.
[26:06] This is something we need to really take
[26:09] note of. That's what we're predominantly
[26:12] going to be talking of in this series or
[26:15] rather in this um this uh subject today.
[26:20] The ark
[26:22] has to be in its original position for
[26:25] it to be effective. Right? Notice the
[26:29] ark is effective is ineffective if it's
[26:32] not in its original position. For it to
[26:35] be effective, it must be in its rightful
[26:37] place, performing its rightful purpose.
[26:40] Right? Like the Israelites taking the
[26:43] ark into battle with them by a corrupt
[26:46] priesthood, the ark should have remained
[26:48] behind the veil. It would have served
[26:50] them better from there. See, they should
[26:53] have recognized the presence of God
[26:55] while the ark was still behind the veil
[26:57] in the tabernacle at Shiloh. And they
[27:00] should not have thought that they needed
[27:02] to bring it to them for God to be with
[27:06] them.
[27:08] Amen. Isn't that exactly how people
[27:10] think today? Right? And look, I don't um
[27:15] condemn people when they ask for certain
[27:17] things. You know, you ask for hands to
[27:20] be laid on you, ask for prayer cloth,
[27:22] you ask for anointing oil. There are
[27:24] many things that that the church uses
[27:26] today as tradition. But those are the
[27:29] things that are just reminders for when
[27:31] you are weak in faith to remind you of
[27:34] the presence of God. But rightfully,
[27:36] brother Baram tells us this in the
[27:39] message. If you really believe the Lord,
[27:42] you don't even need to be in the healing
[27:43] line. You don't need hands laid on you.
[27:46] Just need to believe. And this is the
[27:48] condition in a day like this. In a time
[27:50] like this, people are still believing
[27:53] that they need something physical,
[27:56] something physical to see, something
[27:58] physical to be brought in before them,
[28:00] something physical to be done, something
[28:02] to be laid on them for them to have God
[28:05] give them the victory.
[28:08] And what this indicates when a person is
[28:11] desiring that is that they are not
[28:14] recognizing the presence of God with
[28:16] them.
[28:17] Right? They uh and that's why it is
[28:21] ineffective to them. Now what they did
[28:25] was an indication Israel what they did
[28:27] was an indication that they had stopped
[28:30] seeing the true power of God. Instead
[28:33] they showed that their faith in it was
[28:36] as faith in an idol
[28:40] and they lost that war.
[28:43] right now. Trying to do God a service
[28:46] without it being his will. 1965 27th of
[28:50] November.
[28:52] Paragraph 231.
[28:54] Watch. The prophet says, "The ark in the
[28:57] Bible always is a type of the word to us
[29:02] because it was the word of God in the
[29:05] ark." The word of God in the ark. Notice
[29:09] the ark that they brought up. I'm still
[29:11] reading. Look how they did it. It was
[29:13] not put in its original God orained
[29:15] position. Now God said back here in the
[29:19] law that it must how must it be how it
[29:23] must be done how this ark must be moved
[29:25] and who it must be moved by. But David
[29:28] under his anointing. See so here's a
[29:30] situation where God is pre brother is
[29:33] preaching
[29:34] trying to do God a service without it
[29:36] being his will. and he's talking about
[29:39] how they were moving the ark
[29:42] um in their own thinking that it was
[29:45] going to help them. But he's he's
[29:48] nailing this particular point down that
[29:51] this ark was not in its god orained
[29:54] position in its original god orained
[29:56] position.
[29:58] So therefore the prophet is saying it
[30:00] must be in its god orained position.
[30:03] Notice an important observation
[30:06] is the testimony that is the
[30:09] commandments the law of Moses that is in
[30:12] the ark that makes the ark the word.
[30:17] Now what if the testimony is not in the
[30:19] ark?
[30:21] Is the ark still a type of the word?
[30:24] Absolutely not. Right? And this is this
[30:28] is absolutely significant for you to
[30:32] recognize in the spiritual understanding
[30:34] of this type. Okay? If the word the
[30:38] written word is not beneath that mercy
[30:40] seat,
[30:42] then that ark is just an empty box.
[30:46] Because what is an ark? It is a box that
[30:50] can hold something precious inside.
[30:54] Let's read this message. the ark
[30:56] preached 1955 22nd of May paragraph 134
[31:01] over in the Old Testament he said I'm
[31:03] reading now you shall make an ark
[31:06] and he specified the wood acacia wood or
[31:09] you can make it out of this wood it's
[31:11] called in the Bible shitim wood but it's
[31:14] really called acacia wood and you can
[31:17] make it the same thing the ark and said
[31:20] you shall make it and overlay it with
[31:22] gold watch that ark see if If it typed
[31:26] Christ, notice it typed every time. Noah
[31:29] was a type of Christ making a way. So
[31:32] was Moses. Now watch the ark of the
[31:34] covenant. He said, he said, "You shall
[31:36] make it out of acacia wood and overlay
[31:38] it with gold." Anyone who knows the
[31:41] scripture knows that the gold speaks of
[31:44] deity and wood speaks of humanity.
[31:48] See, he said, "You shall cover it,
[31:50] overlay it with gold over the wood."
[31:53] That's deity over the wood, Christ over
[31:57] the church inside and out, deity
[32:01] overlaid.
[32:04] So now I know you've heard this before.
[32:07] I've heard many preachers in my lifetime
[32:10] talk about this and it's a very
[32:12] important a very uh beautiful thing to
[32:15] talk about. That is humanity covered by
[32:18] deity. And that is basically this this
[32:21] cheap porous
[32:24] uh common wood called acacia or in that
[32:27] time shitim wood. And um this wood was
[32:32] then overlaid with gold to create these
[32:36] um beautiful boxes and uh um um
[32:41] sculptures and so on. So this um brother
[32:46] Maron said this wood typed humanity
[32:50] right because it was not of any precious
[32:53] substance. It was a common wood. It was
[32:56] porous. Um so that means it could soak
[33:00] something in. So it was really a very
[33:03] cheap and common wood was aacia.
[33:06] And then when you overlaid it with gold
[33:09] it became something precious. And that's
[33:13] the type that he used to express
[33:16] uh what man ought to be. And and this
[33:19] very ark was made with this uh uh in
[33:23] this manner. And this is important
[33:25] because it shows that the ark is made of
[33:28] humble simple material yet covered by
[33:32] holiness
[33:34] or the nature of God.
[33:38] righteousness covered by revelation.
[33:42] Okay.
[33:44] Human ability covered by the power of
[33:46] God.
[33:48] That's now what's more important
[33:51] is that without all these things in
[33:54] their right order or position, God would
[33:57] not be able to make his presence known.
[33:59] Or rather, he would not make his
[34:01] presence known. See, without all the
[34:05] specifications being kept regarding this
[34:08] ark, where it ought to be behind the
[34:11] veil in the most holy place and so on,
[34:14] without these specifications, God would
[34:16] not make his presence known. So let's
[34:19] remember all of this has to do where it
[34:22] must be, where the ark must be, how the
[34:24] tabernacle must be built,
[34:26] how the ark must be made, what kind of
[34:29] wood overlaying it with gold, how the
[34:31] cherubams must be built, how the the
[34:34] mercy seat must be built. All this has
[34:37] to do with God's presence being
[34:41] recognized.
[34:42] All right. So I want to bring something
[34:45] now getting into the second half of this
[34:46] teaching. I want to bring something in
[34:48] here to bring to your attention.
[34:52] There are three forms of the word. Okay,
[34:57] three forms. Number one, the written
[35:00] word. Now, what is written word? Written
[35:02] word is recorded word, which means it's
[35:05] word from the past. So, written word or
[35:09] word of the past was placed inside the
[35:12] ark under the mercy seat. Okay. Number
[35:17] two,
[35:19] another type of the word is spoken word.
[35:22] Now spoken word is just think about it.
[35:25] If written word was word of the past and
[35:27] it was recorded word, spoken word is
[35:29] that which is spoken in the present. It
[35:32] is word of the present. It is
[35:34] revelation.
[35:37] In other words, word revealed in this
[35:39] very hour. Okay? And that was typed by
[35:42] the pillar of fire because the pillar of
[35:44] fire was present
[35:47] shakina glory. Right? So written word
[35:51] was placed inside the ark. Watch how
[35:54] this works. When the written word is
[35:56] inside the ark,
[35:58] the pillar of fire descends upon the
[36:00] mercy seat above the mercy seat above
[36:04] the written word and rests between the
[36:06] wings of the cherubams.
[36:09] Right? So, revelation
[36:12] word of present day word descends
[36:15] and becomes the capstone of the written
[36:19] word that is beneath it.
[36:22] Beautiful, isn't it? Then number three
[36:25] is manifested word. And what is
[36:27] manifested word? Manifested word is
[36:30] practiced word. That is word made
[36:34] visible. So written word containing
[36:37] wisdom, spoken word containing
[36:39] revelation. The two come together and
[36:42] then what is this? This is the wood
[36:44] overlaid with gold. Humanity
[36:47] anointed with nature of God producing a
[36:52] specific set of characteristics.
[36:55] So we've got written word, spoken word
[36:58] leading to manifested word. Now this
[37:01] shows us that the entire ark forms the
[37:05] word in all its realms. Okay. What is
[37:10] everything to do with this ark? The fact
[37:12] that it had written word inside pillar
[37:14] of fire descending upon it and because
[37:18] it was made with shitim wood overlaid
[37:21] with gold. This ark had in it all three
[37:24] manifestations or symbolic
[37:26] manifestations of the word. It had
[37:29] written word, spoken word, manifested
[37:31] word in its representation.
[37:35] [clears throat] So this golden box
[37:40] is basically useless without the written
[37:43] word inside.
[37:45] Look at all the symbology there. Okay?
[37:48] There can be no revelation of the
[37:51] written word
[37:52] unless the logos descends upon it to
[37:55] make it alive.
[37:57] Notice in Jesus, we see everything here
[38:01] in him. Jesus had the word, the written
[38:04] word in him. How do we know? Jesus at
[38:07] the temple at 12 began to teach the
[38:10] written word to those people around him.
[38:13] And the people were asking, the great
[38:15] leaders, they were asking, "How does
[38:17] this child know these things?"
[38:20] That's because that written word was
[38:22] within him, right? He had to be in the
[38:25] proper order, right? So, first he had
[38:28] the written word and we saw the
[38:29] manifestation of the written word in
[38:32] him. He knew the scriptures before
[38:35] coming to Matthew chapter 3 when the the
[38:38] logos descends like a spirit um uh
[38:42] descends upon him in the spirit like
[38:44] unto a dove. So, we see him coming his
[38:48] humanity
[38:50] overlaid with gold. On the inside he has
[38:53] a representation of all the written word
[38:56] and then we see the logos descending
[38:58] upon him completing the full
[39:01] manifestation of the art. Right? Finally
[39:05] we see that his body was humble even
[39:08] unto death. That's the humanity the
[39:11] right humanity. Yet he said my words
[39:14] that I speak unto you they are spirit
[39:17] and life. What is that? Revelation and
[39:22] manifestation,
[39:24] okay? Pillar of fire and the written
[39:28] word and his entire manifestation of it
[39:32] makes him the ark.
[39:36] So his body was simple
[39:39] with no beauty that we should desire
[39:41] him. Is that right? Perfect acacia wood,
[39:46] common, looking like any other man, but
[39:49] overlaid with gold. No beauty that we
[39:51] should desire him. [clears throat] Yet
[39:54] his body was sanctified and kept away
[39:57] from sin. So the ark in all senses
[40:02] symbolize
[40:03] the word, written word, spirit and
[40:08] manifestation.
[40:10] Now how can we find such a thing today?
[40:12] Can we find such a thing today amongst
[40:15] the people of God?
[40:18] Let's read this uh a quote from the
[40:22] presence of God unrecognized preached
[40:25] 1964 18th of June
[40:30] and it says paragraphs 173 you know
[40:33] what's the trouble today brother Maram
[40:34] is saying there's people many people
[40:37] with the people that belongs and just go
[40:40] to church and have a creed see they have
[40:42] seen so much just false so much just
[40:45] statues and so much big fine buildings
[40:48] and and we let's not let's not never get
[40:52] off in that kind of a tantrum. See, God
[40:54] don't dwell in big buildings. He dwells
[40:57] in your heart. See, God don't dwell in
[41:00] intellectual education. He's far from
[41:02] it. Watch the saints. Brother Mar is
[41:05] saying that God does not dwell in your
[41:07] mind, in your intellect. He's pointing
[41:10] to past the spirit realm. God doesn't
[41:14] dwell even in your spirit realm. He says
[41:17] he dwells in humility in your heart.
[41:21] Problem 474. He dwells in his word and
[41:25] his word comes into your heart and
[41:28] speaks itself out and declare. Glory to
[41:33] God. Amen.
[41:35] He interprets his own word to you or
[41:40] through you rather.
[41:43] He interprets his own word through you.
[41:47] He's [clears throat] trying to find
[41:48] somebody he can get a hold of to show
[41:51] that he is still God. What What's this
[41:54] saying? He's trying to get somebody that
[41:56] he can get a hold of to make his
[41:58] presence known. Right? We're talking
[42:00] about the Lord's presence.
[42:02] And he is he will do that if he can just
[42:06] get somebody he can speak to. If he can
[42:08] get another woman with the blood issue,
[42:10] he can he can still speak the same
[42:12] thing. He can still do the same thing,
[42:14] making known, declaring we're in the
[42:17] presence of God, not recognize it.
[42:22] So, in conclusion,
[42:25] how much more can this apply to us
[42:29] and what are the conditions surrounding
[42:31] it?
[42:33] Right? H how can we take what we've just
[42:36] looked at a few simple points that we've
[42:38] just looked at so quickly in um the
[42:43] first part of this teaching.
[42:46] How can we take this now and apply this
[42:48] to us? Look at what brother Maram says.
[42:50] God does not dwell in your education
[42:54] in your intellectual education. He's far
[42:56] from it. He dwells in your heart. Right?
[42:59] He dwells in humility in your heart.
[43:04] Just think about that. He dwells in
[43:07] humility in your heart. That means if
[43:09] there's no humility in your heart, God
[43:11] cannot dwell in it.
[43:14] Right?
[43:16] So let's read and I want to read this
[43:18] amazing Psalm 119 11. One little verse.
[43:23] Watch this verse. Thy word have I hid in
[43:28] mine heart that I might not sin against
[43:32] thee.
[43:33] The first thing to notice
[43:35] [clears throat] is that the ark is not
[43:38] your body which is your flesh.
[43:42] Right?
[43:44] You don't need revelation for that. The
[43:46] ark is not your body which is your
[43:48] flesh. Usually when you talk about being
[43:50] the ark, we imagine that our body is the
[43:53] box, the humanity that is overlaid with
[43:56] gold and the Holy Ghost anointing is the
[43:59] gold overlaying it. That's false.
[44:03] Remember the symbology. The body is the
[44:07] outer court.
[44:09] The ark is something mysterious that
[44:12] must be kept inside your soul. Right
[44:15] saints? The ark is part of your humanity
[44:19] that exists inside your soul.
[44:24] Amen. When so when he speaks of
[44:26] humanity, he's not talking about this
[44:29] this common flesh. This flesh is common.
[44:32] Yes. But this flesh is corrupt. It's um
[44:37] it can never be used
[44:40] in the in the context of aacia word,
[44:43] right?
[44:44] When referring to your humanity, there
[44:47] is a part of your your humanity that
[44:49] that lives inside that soul
[44:53] and that's the part that God wants to
[44:55] see because that's the part that he can
[44:58] dwell in. Right?
[45:00] So this ark inside your soul, it is a
[45:06] part of your humanity. your humanity
[45:08] that exists inside your soul that has
[45:10] this this humanity in your soul has the
[45:14] ability to hold within it the written
[45:17] word of God. Right? Now notice this. You
[45:21] can read the Bible and you can hold the
[45:24] the the the memory of the written word
[45:27] in your brain, in your mind, and you can
[45:30] remember scriptures and you can quote
[45:32] scriptures and you can talk about things
[45:35] and you can hold certain things that
[45:38] you've read in your memory, but that's
[45:40] not the soul.
[45:42] That's not the ark. The ark does not
[45:46] abide in that inner court. Neither does
[45:49] it abide in the outer court.
[45:52] There's something in your heart that
[45:55] holds the word within it in the in the
[45:59] essence of the written word. Amen,
[46:02] saints. In the essence of the written
[46:04] word, right? It holds the written word
[46:07] of God in its essence, not in
[46:11] interpretation,
[46:13] not in memory, in essence. Now having
[46:16] said that the problems Christians face
[46:20] uh
[46:22] that they try to behave um like Israel
[46:26] and they they try to bring the ark out
[46:29] into the spirit realm and the body
[46:32] realm. So we've already learned this
[46:34] lesson. What happens when the ark is out
[46:38] of place?
[46:40] It doesn't function according to the way
[46:42] it should and definitely not according
[46:45] to how you would like it to. Right? The
[46:48] ark only comes out when the tabernacle
[46:51] is not built up when the people are on
[46:54] the move. But if the tabernacle is built
[46:57] up, no one has the right to bring the
[47:00] ark outside
[47:02] of their own accord.
[47:05] Right? That's the that's what we learned
[47:06] in this teaching. Now, how do we apply
[47:08] this? What does it mean to us? We
[47:11] constantly try, brothers and sisters, to
[47:14] put the written word in our body realm.
[47:17] And that's a big mistake.
[47:20] We constantly try to put it in our body
[47:22] realm to show that we keep the law by
[47:26] our strength, keeping laws and
[47:28] standards.
[47:30] And what's the result? You will soon be
[47:34] destroyed by your Philistines.
[47:36] Why? Because the more you challenge the
[47:40] body realm with the written word, the
[47:43] more it gives incentive to the weakness
[47:46] of the flesh.
[47:48] Do we have scripture for this? Well,
[47:51] absolutely.
[47:52] Romans 7:8-11,
[47:55] Paul is giving this beautiful teaching
[47:57] in Romans 7 concerning sin and the law.
[48:02] Verse 8-11,
[48:04] but sin taken occasion by the
[48:06] commandment wrought in me all manner of
[48:10] concupisence. So Paul is openly
[48:13] admitting that sin took occasion
[48:16] by the written word to cause in to bring
[48:21] about in me all manner of uncleanness
[48:27] and
[48:28] uh um filth or
[48:32] uh incorrect immoral kind of uh um um
[48:37] thoughts, desires, feelings,
[48:40] right?
[48:41] And he says, "For without the law, sin
[48:44] was dead." Verse 9, "For I was alive
[48:47] without the law once, but when the
[48:50] commandment came, sin revived, and I
[48:53] died." Verse 10, "And the commandment
[48:56] which was ordained to life, I found to
[48:59] be unto death." So he's saying, "The law
[49:01] which was supposed to liberate me and
[49:03] set me free, I found it. It killed me.
[49:09] It destroyed me. Verse 11 gives us the
[49:12] clue. For sin taking occasion by the
[49:18] commandment deceived me and by it slew
[49:22] me. So sin, that's our enemy, right?
[49:26] Taking occasion, in other words, taking
[49:28] advantage of the knowledge of the
[49:31] written word deceived me. How does it
[49:35] deceive me? It caused me to lose my
[49:38] correct vision
[49:40] and thereby slew me, destroyed me,
[49:45] defeated me. So Paul's speaking in a
[49:48] kind of parable but delivering a great
[49:50] teaching here. He's simply saying that
[49:52] when I tried to live the law by my own
[49:55] strength,
[49:56] that is in my body realm, sin took
[49:59] advantage of that law and made me worse
[50:01] than I was than I ever were before.
[50:06] Let's apply this to our live saints as
[50:08] we close this down. To us in the
[50:11] message, much to our discredit and
[50:14] shame, taking the revelation of the word
[50:17] and policing people by it, enforcing a
[50:20] code of behavior and conduct, enforcing
[50:22] laws of marriages, relationships, cood,
[50:27] dressing, etc. We caused more
[50:30] backsliding,
[50:31] more gross failures, low self-esteem in
[50:35] our people and fake living. We caused
[50:39] more fake living than helping our people
[50:42] to become overcomers.
[50:45] I will say this that I believe that God
[50:47] allowed it to happen so we could learn
[50:49] the value of how to deal with the truth,
[50:53] of how to deal with the written word.
[50:57] Let's face it, the written word that we
[50:59] received in our day was the message of
[51:01] of the prophet. That was the written
[51:04] word that was given to us in all the
[51:05] message books and the tapes and we took
[51:08] it and we applied it
[51:12] but in the wrong court.
[51:15] What we should have done was teach our
[51:17] people what it means to have the ark in
[51:20] our souls
[51:22] and do as David did. Thy word have I hid
[51:26] in my heart that I might not sin against
[51:29] thee. We took it and placed it on the
[51:32] outer court realm. The inner court realm
[51:36] that means the wonderful beautiful
[51:40] written word of the scriptures and the
[51:42] message saints was not meant to be
[51:45] something fleshed around on the outside
[51:48] which uplifted the abilities of men and
[51:51] women.
[51:52] Right? What do I mean? When you took the
[51:56] this beautiful written word of the
[51:58] scriptures and the message and you
[52:00] applied it in the outer court, surely
[52:04] the the people who began to get the most
[52:06] respect were [clears throat] people who
[52:08] grew up in forms of life where they were
[52:12] they were well trained. They came from
[52:15] good backgrounds.
[52:17] They came from good understandings
[52:20] uh and they were able to take the
[52:22] message and they uh were able to in
[52:25] inverted commas live the life. They were
[52:28] able to keep rules very well. And what
[52:32] this did was it uplifted the pride of
[52:34] these men and women and those who came
[52:37] from you know terrible neighborhoods and
[52:41] bad situations and horrible pasts. They
[52:45] struggled to keep this beautiful written
[52:49] word and the of scriptures and message.
[52:51] They struggled to keep it in their outer
[52:54] court because that's where they were
[52:55] taught to keep it.
[52:58] Right? Then even worse, this beautiful
[53:03] written word was not meant to be fleshed
[53:05] around in the minds of intellectual
[53:08] ministers to show how sharp they are to
[53:11] argue revelation to prove doctrinal
[53:14] teaching.
[53:16] No saints, it was meant to be held in a
[53:19] humble heart, a humble soul,
[53:23] in the essence of the word.
[53:26] Amen. where the logos could descend on
[53:30] it and confirm the presence of the Lord.
[53:34] Saints, anyone can tell you when you
[53:37] took the written word of this message
[53:39] and put it in your outer court, you can
[53:42] never tell me that the logos descended
[53:44] upon it. The logos is not going to
[53:47] descend upon that mercy seat if that ark
[53:50] is not in its rightful god orained
[53:54] original place.
[53:57] That's why many people go through the
[53:59] message and only find that God starts to
[54:01] become real to them so late in their
[54:04] lives.
[54:07] All right? So only then when it's in a
[54:11] humble heart and a soul and the the
[54:14] person's being you and I have taken the
[54:17] written word in its essence
[54:20] not in intellectualism but in its
[54:22] essence and when that logos descends
[54:25] into our soul it confirms the presence
[54:28] of God and only then does a true
[54:30] manifestation of the word take place
[54:33] vindicating the presence of God and the
[54:35] purpose of the word being in that
[54:37] vessel. What does that mean? Only then
[54:40] when that logos descends into the heart
[54:42] and soul of the believer, only then does
[54:46] the life of that believer become a true
[54:49] manifestation. Prior to that, it's a
[54:52] fake manifestation.
[54:56] The last quote here from God has a
[54:59] provided way. We're going to read this
[55:01] and then we can close this off.
[55:05] This an absolutely wonderful quote. God
[55:07] is a provider. We preach 1954, 4th of
[55:09] April, paragraph 65. Brother Brandham
[55:12] quotes the scripture we read Psalm
[55:14] 119:11.
[55:15] Thy word have I hid in my heart, oh
[55:18] Lord. Brother Bram says, David, and then
[55:21] he speaks. Brother Ram speaks to the
[55:23] church. Listen to these words, saints.
[55:25] Hide God's word away in your heart and
[55:29] then God will keep that word.
[55:32] God has to keep his word. Listen saints.
[55:36] He says God doesn't have to heal to
[55:39] prove his power, but he has to heal to
[55:42] keep his word. That's right. God don't
[55:45] have to prove nothing. He's God. But
[55:48] what he speaks, he's obligated to his
[55:50] word. So are you and I obligated to our
[55:54] word. And God's obligated to his word.
[55:56] So I I just want to bring this in. When
[55:58] the ark is held in its rightful place,
[56:01] saints, you will never expect God to
[56:04] prove himself. You will never have the
[56:07] nature to expect God to prove himself to
[56:10] you.
[56:12] See, when we've got people and we
[56:14] ourselves who ask the question, where
[56:16] was God when this happened? Where was
[56:18] God when this happened? How can you even
[56:21] ask a question, where was God when this
[56:23] happened? Why could you not recognize
[56:26] the presence of God? Why could you not
[56:28] recognize the presence of the Lord?
[56:32] And you wanted basically what your your
[56:34] carnal flesh wanted was to pull the ark
[56:37] out into a visible place into a public
[56:39] place because you felt like the only way
[56:42] you were going to be believe God is if
[56:44] something physical happened before your
[56:46] eyes.
[56:49] Saints, the tabernacle has been
[56:51] successfully set up by the apostles, the
[56:54] founders of the Christian church and the
[56:56] reformers through the church ages.
[56:58] Christianity helped put the tabernacle
[57:01] together.
[57:02] Next came in the seven church age the
[57:04] Elijah who turned our hearts back to the
[57:09] original faith. He Elijah built up our
[57:12] most holy place and cleansed it and
[57:15] sanctified it to receive the open book.
[57:18] He challenged our motives, our
[57:20] objectives, our seat of desires, our
[57:22] ambitions and our purpose. He softened
[57:25] our heart and left it clean with a
[57:28] yearning and a thirsting and a hungering
[57:30] for the fountain of life. Then the third
[57:33] pull ministry brought the ark back to
[57:36] us. There is no need for us to be
[57:39] mishandling the word anymore, saints,
[57:41] and leaving it to fall into the hands of
[57:43] our Philistines.
[57:46] So what does it mean to hold the word in
[57:48] your heart?
[57:50] In closing,
[57:52] if you are holding the word out of fear
[57:56] of what people say and to make a
[57:59] statement to people for recognition,
[58:03] you are holding the word in the outer
[58:05] court.
[58:07] [clears throat]
[58:08] If you are holding the word out of fear
[58:11] that you might not make the translation
[58:14] or to try to match your knowledge of the
[58:16] word with fellow believers,
[58:19] then you are holding the ark in the
[58:21] inner court.
[58:23] And if in those two cases that is how
[58:26] you are living your life right now, you
[58:28] are heading for absolute misery if you
[58:31] haven't been through it already.
[58:34] But saints, if the word is your
[58:37] influence
[58:38] for how you think, that is, if it's a
[58:42] lamp unto your feet and a light unto
[58:44] your path, if it's the influence of how
[58:46] you live your life, if you hold the word
[58:49] just so you can enjoy feasting in its
[58:52] wisdom and its truth, if it directs the
[58:55] way you think and feel beyond the peer
[58:58] pressure of the world, if you don't care
[59:01] what people think or feel because you
[59:05] live your life by conviction.
[59:08] If you live without doubt of who you
[59:11] are, if you live your daily life not
[59:15] using the word critically against other
[59:17] believers,
[59:19] then you are holding the word in your
[59:21] soul. Then it has found its place of
[59:24] rest.
[59:26] If your greatest love is to read the
[59:30] word of God and hear the open book being
[59:33] preached, if you have a knack of stating
[59:36] things right by the word and it's being
[59:39] vindicated by other believers that what
[59:41] you said was right, if the way your life
[59:44] you the way you live your life and you
[59:47] make your decisions are admired and
[59:50] sought after by those that are in
[59:53] trouble or in need.
[59:56] If you have happiness in your soul
[59:58] amidst the worst of trials, then it
[1:00:01] means the logos has descended upon your
[1:00:04] ark in your soul and your tabernacle is
[1:00:09] manifesting the wisdom of the written
[1:00:11] word.
[1:00:13] Also then saints, every time you read
[1:00:17] the message of the prophet, hallelujah,
[1:00:20] the cloud will descend into the gates of
[1:00:23] your tabernacle and shut all other
[1:00:26] influences of confusion out and the
[1:00:29] spoken word will be communed in the most
[1:00:32] holy place. The Lord's presence will be
[1:00:35] felt by your whole tabernacle and others
[1:00:39] will know that he is here.
[1:00:43] without you having to tell them or prove
[1:00:46] it to them.
[1:00:48] Remember the Bible says when Moses went
[1:00:52] into the holiest of holies to commune
[1:00:54] with the Lord, the cloud came and stood
[1:00:57] in the door of the tabernacle. That's
[1:01:00] what I mean.
[1:01:02] When you take the message of the word of
[1:01:05] this day, when you take the revealed
[1:01:06] word of the Lord, the message of the
[1:01:09] prophet for this day, it is the prophet
[1:01:11] going into the the most holy place, the
[1:01:14] cloud will descend in the gates of the
[1:01:18] tabernacle, shutting off your entire
[1:01:20] being from influences, from confusion,
[1:01:25] and the spoken word, which is
[1:01:26] revelation,
[1:01:28] will be communed in your most holy
[1:01:30] place.
[1:01:32] Amen. And that will cause the Lord's
[1:01:36] presence to be felt in the whole
[1:01:37] tabernacle.
[1:01:40] That is what you want, saints. That is
[1:01:42] what I want. That is what we desire with
[1:01:44] all that is within us. What we find is
[1:01:48] when we study what this ark is and how
[1:01:52] it was supposed to be handled, the
[1:01:54] mystery of of how it was supposed to be
[1:01:57] dealt with. We realize the mistakes that
[1:02:00] we make in our lives, they're all
[1:02:03] self-inflicted.
[1:02:05] The things we bring upon ourselves, the
[1:02:07] decisions we make, the life paths that
[1:02:09] we choose is because we thought we were
[1:02:14] going into problems, we use the name of
[1:02:17] Jesus Christ, we use the traditions of
[1:02:19] Christianity,
[1:02:21] we use prayer, we use fasting and
[1:02:23] prayer, we use going to church. all
[1:02:26] intellectually
[1:02:28] putting the word in the outer court and
[1:02:31] sometimes in the inner court and
[1:02:33] expecting to destroy our Philistines.
[1:02:37] But according to the word that only
[1:02:40] makes the Philistines stronger because
[1:02:43] those Philistines actually recognize
[1:02:47] instantly the presence of the Lord. I
[1:02:49] mean, just take an example. When Christ
[1:02:51] hit the shores of Galilee
[1:02:53] and that maniac of Gdara came rushing
[1:02:56] down, all the the people around didn't
[1:03:00] recognize who Christ was. But this
[1:03:02] demon-possessed man, why? Because the
[1:03:04] demons recognize him straight away. They
[1:03:07] came straight to him and said, "Jesus,
[1:03:10] thou son of God, what have you do with
[1:03:12] whatever we to do with thee? Why have
[1:03:14] you come to torment us before before our
[1:03:16] time?" And that's exactly what happens
[1:03:19] when the word is the written word is
[1:03:22] placed in your articort and it
[1:03:24] challenges
[1:03:26] the Philistines.
[1:03:29] The the Philistines feel the presence of
[1:03:31] the Lord first. They know it's their
[1:03:33] time. They're being judged. They're
[1:03:35] going to become in in incensed. They
[1:03:38] want to fight back with all their
[1:03:40] strength. And that's what happens. We
[1:03:42] feel ourselves being overtaken
[1:03:45] because we've got the ark not in its god
[1:03:49] orained position.
[1:03:53] Saints,
[1:03:54] let's look at this. Look at our lives
[1:03:56] with deep, deep eyes of revelation and
[1:04:00] understanding
[1:04:02] and let's do the right thing.
[1:04:05] Let's break all the traditions of the
[1:04:06] past. It's not too late to say I want to
[1:04:10] change it. I want to change how I
[1:04:12] thought before. I want to change my
[1:04:14] whole church. I want to change my whole
[1:04:17] family. I want to I want to I want to
[1:04:19] admit where I went wrong. I want to put
[1:04:22] the ark in the right place
[1:04:25] because I know that when I put it in the
[1:04:27] right place, then the logos is going to
[1:04:29] descend upon the mercy seat and I will
[1:04:32] feel the presence of the Lord in my
[1:04:34] entire tabernacle.
[1:04:36] And then I will find that I am
[1:04:39] manifesting my true purpose. And then
[1:04:41] I'm really living the life. I'm living
[1:04:44] the message. I'm living the word
[1:04:46] according to how it's supposed to. I'm
[1:04:48] not faking it anymore. Prayer means far
[1:04:51] more to me. Live uh living a genuine
[1:04:55] life before the people means far more to
[1:04:57] me. Reading the word is an absolute the
[1:05:00] greatest pleasure. There's nothing I
[1:05:02] live for more than to hear the open book
[1:05:05] being preached. Nothing excites my soul
[1:05:07] anymore than just this. And you can't
[1:05:10] fake this.
[1:05:14] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:05:16] Saints, I trust then this will bless
[1:05:18] your heart. This will help us when you
[1:05:22] pray together
[1:05:24] and you remember the things that were
[1:05:26] spoken today.
[1:05:30] Make sure your heart is sincere,
[1:05:32] contrite.
[1:05:34] Don't just talk about it.
[1:05:37] Don't just consider it. Do something
[1:05:40] about it.
[1:05:42] Take the ark into the most holy place.
[1:05:47] Amen. And amen. May the Lord bless you
[1:05:50] till the next time.
