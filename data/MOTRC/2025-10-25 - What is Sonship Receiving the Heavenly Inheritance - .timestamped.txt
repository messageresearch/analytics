[0:00] So let's look at sunship
[0:03] adoption part four paragraph 75 look has
[0:06] predestinated un us unto this
[0:09] inheritance. If I'm a right inheritance
[0:12] of something if God is knocking at my
[0:14] heart and saying William Brandom I
[0:16] called you a long time ago before the
[0:17] foundation of the world to preach the
[0:19] gospel. I have an inheritance an
[0:21] inheritance of eternal life. Now God
[0:24] sent Jesus to make that inheritance real
[0:26] to me.
[0:31] Right? God sent Jesus to make that
[0:34] inheritance real to me.
[0:39] Amen. Because there was nothing I could
[0:42] do to inherit it.
[0:44] I was an orphan.
[0:47] It was blank.
[0:49] It was in it was valid. There's nothing
[0:51] I can do. But in the fullness of time,
[0:54] God sent in his own good time Jesus the
[0:57] lamb slain from the foundation of the
[0:58] world. His blood was shed that I might
[1:01] go to my inheritance. Now here it is to
[1:04] be what? What inheritance? To sunship
[1:09] &gt;&gt; to be a son of God.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; Now what was becoming sons about?
[1:15] Remember last week becoming sons was
[1:17] about receiving theophony.
[1:20] Theophony is theophony is the heavenly
[1:23] inheritance.
[1:24] Theophony is actually the son of god.
[1:28] Right now you see theophony does not
[1:31] need adoption.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; Because theophony knows its father.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; What needs adoption is this body. Amen.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; Because this body does not have a link
[1:44] to its father.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; The only link there is is the attribute.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49] &gt;&gt; So this body needs the spirit of
[1:51] adoption to come to the same
[1:54] understanding as the theophony.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; The theophony is the son of God.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; This is the son of man,
[2:02] &gt;&gt; right? The son of Charles and Elabbrand,
[2:04] the son of uh Steven and Jennifer
[2:06] Francis, the son of the Frances. This is
[2:08] this body.
[2:10] But then someday you come to an
[2:12] understanding. I am not the son of so
[2:14] and so. I am the son of God. How do you
[2:17] come to that understanding? You're
[2:20] coming to the same understanding of that
[2:22] theophony.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; Because that theophony is the son of
[2:26] God.
[2:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29] &gt;&gt; That's what becoming sons means. So your
[2:32] inheritance,
[2:34] this body's inheritance, this what this
[2:37] body is looking to is to become a son.
[2:43] Amen. Becoming sons is about theophanes.
[2:46] So this one word speaks of everything we
[2:50] have been speaking about, right? But the
[2:52] first part of our inheritance is
[2:54] sunship. That's the first part of our
[2:56] inheritance. So now here's the thing.
[3:01] Adam
[3:02] inherited the earth, right?
[3:05] &gt;&gt; What made Adam God of the earth, the
[3:09] theophony?
[3:13] &gt;&gt; So you cannot even inherit the earth
[3:15] first without getting the theophony.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; So without getting the heavenly
[3:20] inheritance, you cannot inherit the
[3:22] earthly inheritance.
[3:25] Let me put it to you personally.
[3:29] You cannot have the eternal fleshly body
[3:35] for each one of you personally unless
[3:38] you first inherit the theophony.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; Because it's the theophony that's going
[3:42] to make the flesh eternal.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Understood?
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:50] &gt;&gt; That's what you are looking for
[3:52] permanently.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham was searching for. a
[3:57] city who which had foundations whose
[4:01] builder and maker was God. Because if he
[4:05] obtained theophony, he would live
[4:07] forever in the flesh.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; Though he had obtained Israel, he was
[4:14] still looking for a city whose builder
[4:16] and maker was God.
[4:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is becoming sons
[4:22] connects you with your theophony, your
[4:25] heavenly inheritance which then gives
[4:28] you the earth.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the title deed. Do you see
[4:35] it? So this is not about seeing Jesus as
[4:38] God. The first thing we inherit is
[4:41] sunship of Christ. We see the sunship of
[4:43] Christ through belief in the revelation
[4:46] of Christ as God. And that's not saying
[4:49] ah okay so Jesus is God prove it to me
[4:52] and then we go through this whole you
[4:53] know godship uh doctrine and prove this
[4:57] by that scripture and that
[5:00] to me that's exhausting
[5:02] to have to to have to go through some to
[5:04] prove to you by scriptures and what this
[5:06] one says and how this one is better than
[5:08] that one and how brother Brandham says
[5:09] this better than Billy Graham or how
[5:12] brotherham says this better than I got
[5:14] no time for that.
[5:16] What? Like what's preventing you from
[5:18] seeing that Christ is is God?
[5:24] What do you need? Christ himself said,
[5:26] "I've been here so long. You You do not
[5:29] know that I am the father. The father I
[5:32] am in the Father, the Father in me, and
[5:33] we are one. Have I been with you so long
[5:36] and you're still asking to see the
[5:37] Father?"
[5:39] &gt;&gt; What do you need to know?
[5:41] What do you need to satisfy that
[5:43] immature little puny childish brain of
[5:45] yours that requires logic and reasoning
[5:48] and proof and and all the links and
[5:51] sources you can get from the internet to
[5:53] prove that Christ is God?
[5:57] &gt;&gt; This is not about seeing Jesus as God.
[6:01] This this is the belief that we have by
[6:03] faith.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; The mystery revealed in Christ. Okay.
[6:08] Are you are you with me?
[6:10] I'm going to say this once. If you're
[6:13] not going to get it now, you're never
[6:15] going to get it ever. Pack up and leave.
[6:18] Right?
[6:20] What is the mystery of Christ?
[6:23] What is Jesus Christ?
[6:26] What does he mean by if you've seen me,
[6:28] you've seen the father?
[6:30] What does it mean to you personally?
[6:33] Only one thing. Jesus Christ is proof
[6:37] that man can be God.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; That's the most meaningful thing to you.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Everything else is Christian theology.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; What manner of man is this that the wind
[6:55] and the seas obey him?
[6:57] &gt;&gt; What manner of man is this that he
[6:59] raised Lazarus from the dead? What
[7:01] manner of man is this that he could
[7:02] allow himself to be taken and scourged
[7:05] and put on the cross to die and then
[7:07] rise again? What manner of man is this
[7:10] to forgive sins?
[7:12] What manner of man is this to descend to
[7:14] hell and release one dimension and take
[7:16] them up into another?
[7:19] &gt;&gt; This is the revelation that man can be
[7:23] God.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; What is this all about? The story of God
[7:26] and man.
[7:27] &gt;&gt; That God could become man and man could
[7:29] become God. Jesus Christ is the
[7:32] manifestation that man can be God.
[7:37] &gt;&gt; That's the only meaningful thing to you.
[7:40] Nothing else.
[7:42] &gt;&gt; That's not going to be proven to you by
[7:43] words of William Brandham or words of
[7:45] Billy Graham or whichever other ham you
[7:49] can find. Right? There's not not any
[7:52] other person. If you didn't get this by
[7:55] the Bible and the message already,
[7:57] you've missed the point. Yes.
[8:00] &gt;&gt; Because that's what you're being
[8:01] connected to.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; You're being connected to knowing that
[8:06] one day you can be like Christ.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; And what are you saying then?
[8:14] See that man can be God.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; That's what almost all Christians miss.
[8:22] That's what the Jews accused Christ of.
[8:24] What do they say? You being a man,
[8:28] &gt;&gt; make yourself God.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; That's the reason they crucified him.
[8:33] &gt;&gt; Called him bilab said he was blaspheing.
[8:37] That was the entire purpose and the
[8:40] revelation of God in Christ is that man
[8:44] can be God. Man can declare the father.
[8:49] Man can manifest the fountain of life.
[8:53] Man can display the fountain of seven
[8:55] colors. Man can display the everlasting
[8:59] elam. Man can display Elohim. Man can
[9:02] display Yahweh, Jehovah, the
[9:05] self-existing one.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; This is proof. Christ is proof that this
[9:09] is possible.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; And he came to tell you that you were
[9:15] that originally and sin came in by your
[9:19] own choice. But there's a way for you to
[9:22] get back there.
[9:24] That's Christianity.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; Not this nonsense we make today with
[9:30] churches and denominations and this name
[9:32] and that name and everyone's leading you
[9:35] someplace to to to where some man gave
[9:39] you an idea of what you are what you're
[9:42] going to be or what you have to do. And
[9:45] usually it amounts to paying an x amount
[9:47] of money to the church for the rest of
[9:49] your life
[9:51] with a promise of something cuz if you
[9:53] don't it's going to, you know, it's
[9:56] going to be detrimental to your place in
[10:00] heaven.
[10:04] That's what all men do.
[10:06] We know that story. It's it's recorded
[10:09] through history. Men are going to dupe
[10:12] you.
[10:13] Men are going to take away your free
[10:15] will.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; They're going to use religion and power
[10:18] and and uh and and fear and scare you
[10:23] about hell and demons and witchcraft and
[10:26] and and all kinds of terrifying things
[10:29] and why you need God and you need prayer
[10:31] and you need oil and you need holy water
[10:34] and you need saints and you need Mary
[10:36] and you need whole of people to go
[10:39] through or else you're dead meat.
[10:45] Yeah. What kind of God is that?
[10:48] One who walks around in eggshells and
[10:50] fear half his life.
[10:53] Crossing yourself, sprinkling,
[10:57] using liquids, all kinds of weird
[10:59] things, and blessed this and blessed
[11:01] cloth and blessed clothing and blessed
[11:04] stuff and blessed stick and blessed
[11:07] Bible and all of that.
[11:09] You're just a person still under the
[11:12] spirit of bondage. You haven't even seen
[11:15] father yet.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, if you seen
[11:19] father, you break out of your house with
[11:21] your chest standing out.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; You you you we break out of this life
[11:28] saying what can separate me from the
[11:30] love of God?
[11:31] &gt;&gt; No danger, peril, sore, no nothing, no
[11:34] disease, no death, no nothing can
[11:36] separate me. That's your experience when
[11:39] you are connected to him.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I want to show you.
[11:47] So, so what's our inheritance? Sunship,
[11:50] theophony, heavenly inheritance. Abraham
[11:53] was not linked to it yet because Messiah
[11:55] had not come. They all did such great
[11:58] things but they they did not receive it
[12:00] because Messiah had not yet come because
[12:03] father had not been revealed to them
[12:04] yet.
[12:06] &gt;&gt; Right?
[12:07] Now sunship has been made known.
[12:09] Theophony is in sight. Right now all
[12:13] those from Abraham's day all the way up
[12:14] to Christ, they died and went into the
[12:16] fifth dimension, Abraham's bosom. They
[12:19] were not yet sixth dimension. They did
[12:21] not attain heavenly status. Only after
[12:24] Christ was the way paved to sunship
[12:27] to attain theophony.
[12:30] Now what is a son?
[12:34] How many of you think you know what a
[12:35] son is?
[12:37] &gt;&gt; H a son is not somebody who just plays
[12:41] before the father. A son is not somebody
[12:44] who uh has to be given something and the
[12:46] father must pet him on the head and tell
[12:48] him good boy, good boy, well done.
[12:51] That's a dog.
[12:55] &gt;&gt; That's not a son.
