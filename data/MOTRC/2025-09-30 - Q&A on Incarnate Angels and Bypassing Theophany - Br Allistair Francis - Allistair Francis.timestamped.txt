[0:01] Amen. While you're standing, we're going
[0:03] to read Revelations 12 7 to8. A simple
[0:09] little scripture.
[0:11] Revelations 12 7 to8.
[0:15] And there was war in heaven. Michael and
[0:19] his angels fought against the dragon.
[0:22] And the dragon fought and his angels and
[0:26] prevailed not. Neither was their place
[0:29] found anymore in heaven. The Lord add a
[0:32] blessing to his word. You may be seated.
[0:35] Amen.
[0:37] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[0:40] Good to be with you this morning,
[0:41] saints, and greetings in the precious
[0:43] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[0:45] Christ.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; Good to have Kino back with us
[0:49] and all healed up. And so we um thankful
[0:53] to God for his healing virtue. And um uh
[0:58] yeah, we just keep the little ones in
[1:01] prayer that uh brother Theo's little
[1:04] boy. And um I trust that we will all be
[1:10] back to normal soon. And we know it's
[1:12] we've reached this uh season here in
[1:14] Durban where it's allergies and flu and
[1:17] it's like a like a repeating cycle and
[1:21] um so yeah, just protect yourself. But
[1:23] uh it's good thing we have in Durban we
[1:26] have these uh months of bright hot
[1:29] sunshine that burns everything out you
[1:32] know makes you sweat out of every paw
[1:34] and uh fills the the place and burns out
[1:38] all the viruses and then we get this
[1:41] damp cold for like a few months. So but
[1:46] we're thankful to God. It's it's it's a
[1:48] beautiful earth out there.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. and just uh humans seem to lose
[1:53] their weight and make it ugly and bring
[1:56] a lot of uh stress and distress upon us.
[1:59] But we're thankful that we have we have
[2:02] we are being restored back to what God
[2:04] wanted us to be. Amen.
[2:07] &gt;&gt; So um I'm going to be doing question and
[2:10] answers uh 2025. This is part six and
[2:14] I've got four questions to do. So, just
[2:17] remember we and I I in my head I don't
[2:20] think I'm going to be that long.
[2:24] My family says they never trust me when
[2:26] I say that. Uh but you know, I I was
[2:30] speaking to some of the brothers. Uh we
[2:32] were talking about uh preaching and
[2:34] things at the brother's meeting and I
[2:36] said uh uh you you fellas that that
[2:40] complain about preaching I said uh I'd
[2:43] like to see you try take four pages and
[2:47] let's see how long you go with that
[2:50] or take eight pages and see how long you
[2:53] go with that. Um and you find you may
[2:56] write four pages and you'll be done in
[2:58] 10 minutes and then you'll be wondering
[2:59] what now.
[3:01] And then you take uh two pages and then
[3:04] you're speaking and speaking and
[3:05] speaking and you can go on for an hour
[3:06] and a half and you think what happened?
[3:09] I thought it was just an exhaltation
[3:12] and uh it's just so uh different and I
[3:16] suppose when you get to teach a series
[3:18] and when revelation flows when people
[3:21] are you know drawing or the Lord is
[3:24] putting thoughts in your mind you know
[3:26] you just got to you just got to go with
[3:28] what he does what he says. So, um
[3:33] I must say this has been a real um
[3:37] strange phenomenon the last few months
[3:40] since coming back from uh North America
[3:43] and the the questions and the
[3:46] fellowship. It's it's a little uh too
[3:49] much to handle. uh there's so much of
[3:53] demand
[3:55] uh from people all over the world for
[3:57] you know for answers and of course we
[3:59] can't give all the answers but uh and
[4:02] especially I've been really encouraged
[4:04] with uh young people who have been
[4:07] stepping up and you know asking
[4:09] questions and that's what that's what we
[4:11] desire
[4:13] um and I want to say this in in in this
[4:15] time where the attraction of the world
[4:20] is so great and you have the people
[4:22] especially the young people being
[4:24] attracted out into the world into other
[4:27] things. I'm so happy to see the interest
[4:31] in the word
[4:32] &gt;&gt; and I believe our ministries and select
[4:36] ministries around the world that are
[4:38] speaking the open book and talking about
[4:40] real things are actually bringing the
[4:43] children back and getting them to ask
[4:46] but what does the prophet mean and
[4:47] they're reading things and what about
[4:49] this and what about that I mean I I even
[4:51] have a question which I which I had to
[4:53] let out I I I left it out was what is
[4:56] your opinion of Charlie Cook
[4:59] and you know a real like what's your
[5:03] what's your feelings on it? I didn't
[5:05] even think I would have to answer
[5:07] something like but it looks like I have
[5:08] to because they they've been hearing
[5:10] like uh conflicting thoughts about it
[5:13] from different ministers. So I try I try
[5:17] to you know look at some things that I
[5:19] feel are relevant. You can't imagine how
[5:22] many questions there are. Hundreds. And
[5:24] I'm trying to look at some of them that
[5:26] are relevant and others that I feel
[5:27] which are a blessing. But to every
[5:29] person who asks a question, there's some
[5:32] other reason why they're asking that
[5:34] question. And you got to tap into that,
[5:36] &gt;&gt; you know, because it's something
[5:37] affecting their lives. All right. So
[5:40] that being settled, let's go to um our
[5:44] subject. Well, the questions are mostly
[5:47] going to be on the incarnation of
[5:48] angels. And I know that's some of you
[5:51] looking at what is that now and
[5:54] bypassing the theophony. So once again,
[5:57] you know, you're preaching a subject,
[5:59] you're preaching something else all
[6:00] together and you get a you get questions
[6:02] on something you were not even preaching
[6:04] about, but you're saying things that you
[6:07] thought everyone understood. And this is
[6:09] good, right? And of course when we
[6:13] listen to things and we preach about it
[6:15] and you you are comfortable with it, we
[6:18] don't make doctrines out of it. We don't
[6:20] make buzzwords out of it. We don't labor
[6:23] on it to make it a big deal. But then
[6:25] someone hears it and they think it's a
[6:28] big deal and they bring it to our
[6:29] attention and then we look at it and
[6:32] say, "Wow, well, why did you think
[6:35] that?" That's what is meaningful to us.
[6:39] Why did you think that? Let's look at
[6:41] why you thought that and then it opens
[6:43] up more to us. That's what I appreciate
[6:45] about question and answers. So let's go
[6:48] to question one and this is from uh
[6:52] youth actually youth in Africa, central
[6:56] and northern Africa. In recent camps we
[6:59] experienced a powerful outpouring of the
[7:02] Holy Spirit after one of the services.
[7:04] Many were deeply moved shouting, crying,
[7:07] falling under the anointing. In the
[7:09] midst of this, one sister went into the
[7:11] spirit and a presence took hold of her.
[7:14] That spirit identified itself as an
[7:17] angel from God and began speaking to
[7:20] people, calling out their sins and so
[7:22] forth.
[7:24] Again,
[7:25] similar manifestations occurred again,
[7:29] but this time through several different
[7:32] individuals.
[7:33] Uh in other words, uh this incarnation
[7:37] of angels upon other people, it spreads
[7:40] like a virus, right? The spirits
[7:43] identified themselves as Michael,
[7:45] Gabriel, archangels, and even as the
[7:49] Lord Jesus Christ. They instructed
[7:51] people to repent, warned against worldly
[7:55] clothing, encouraged fasting, and even
[7:57] made predictions about the future. Now,
[8:00] here's the question. Is such a
[8:02] manifestation scriptural? Can angels
[8:05] incarnate in human beings to deliver
[8:08] such messages of repentance and
[8:11] prophecy?
[8:13] All right. So,
[8:16] um very interesting question
[8:19] &gt;&gt; and it was I would say it was
[8:21] inevitable. It was going to happen
[8:24] because when people when churches
[8:28] forget to preach the truth or spend a
[8:32] lot of time not getting into the truth,
[8:34] they are going to get into
[8:35] sensationalism.
[8:37] They are going to get into situations
[8:39] where it's going to be about
[8:41] manifestations and prophecies and that
[8:44] kind of thing. So I mean for me the
[8:46] first question that I would ask is why
[8:49] do you need incarnate angels to tell you
[8:51] to to shape up?
[8:55] &gt;&gt; Uh you have the word and you have actual
[8:58] flesh and blood angels preaching behind
[9:01] your pulpits and deacons and everything
[9:03] to tell you listen shape up get your
[9:06] life right. You don't need incarnate or
[9:09] angels incarnate. So there are I'm just
[9:12] telling you something that's really not
[9:14] in my notes, but this has happened from
[9:17] a long time ago when the denominational
[9:19] churches believed that the fallen angels
[9:22] that were kicked out of heaven became
[9:25] incarnate in man and made them do things
[9:29] right. To me, a lot of a lot of that is
[9:32] excuses. Like can you imagine people who
[9:35] would say, "Well, you know what I did?
[9:37] It wasn't really me. It was an angel.
[9:39] the fallen angel that incarnate himself
[9:41] in me. Any person can make that excuse,
[9:44] but it's you that did the thing.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; See, so I just want to straight off my
[9:51] answer would be say this is unscriptural
[9:55] and it's pagan. I want to start there.
[9:58] &gt;&gt; This is the exact reason why we preach
[10:01] the truth about the Holy Ghost.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; Why you must understand what is an
[10:06] anointing and what is the person.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right? So even when we say
[10:11] incarnate means to become flesh. So when
[10:15] you say that like the angel Michael or
[10:17] the angel Gabriel became flesh in me to
[10:21] tell me something, why would you do
[10:24] that?
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Why would the angel Michael announce
[10:28] himself in the flesh of a human being in
[10:32] the age of the Holy Ghost?
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[10:36] In the time where the Holy Ghost is the
[10:38] authority,
[10:40] &gt;&gt; what is Michael doing?
[10:42] &gt;&gt; What is Gabriel doing?
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Right? So immediately when you when you
[10:49] see things and and the tragic thing is
[10:52] that ministers don't discern this
[10:55] &gt;&gt; and that that elders of the church don't
[10:57] discern this. And I'll tell you, I don't
[10:59] believe it's because the there's
[11:00] something wrong with the elders or it's
[11:02] because of a culture that has made
[11:05] sensationalism and signs and wonders
[11:09] of such importance
[11:12] that they're afraid that when they see a
[11:15] manifestation, they think it must be
[11:17] God. No. You can be in a Christian
[11:20] church. You can be in this church today
[11:23] and you can have a manifestation that
[11:25] looks like God. can be absolutely the
[11:27] devil.
[11:28] &gt;&gt; And your question would be, how could
[11:30] this happen among us?
[11:34] &gt;&gt; This happened in heaven.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; This happened right in Eden.
[11:41] You're not some cocooned place simply
[11:44] because you have the open book that the
[11:46] enemy the enemy is going to squeeze in
[11:48] everywhere he can.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; You can anoint your whole house with
[11:53] oil.
[11:55] You're not creating some shield barrier
[11:57] to keep fifth dimension out
[11:59] &gt;&gt; as long as you're living in this world
[12:00] and you're living among lies.
[12:03] You can be infiltrated by any spirit.
[12:07] &gt;&gt; The only difference is it only affects
[12:09] you if you live in fear of it
[12:11] &gt;&gt; and you don't have faith in the word.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; You are meant to have resistance. You
[12:16] are meant to have spirits coming against
[12:19] you in whatever shape or form, but you
[12:22] are meant to have the faith of God in
[12:24] the word to resist that.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Resist the devil and he shall flee.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the problem is, you know, when
[12:32] you invite a snake in and think you can
[12:36] make him your pet
[12:39] and think he has a brain to even have
[12:42] affection for you, you are a fool.
[12:45] because they don't they're waiting for
[12:48] the opportunity to bite you because it's
[12:51] the nature of a snake, right? I I uh
[12:55] remember telling you how that you have
[12:58] these um you know people in Africa who
[13:01] and and surprisingly other parts of the
[13:04] world, you know, they take pythons and
[13:06] then they believe they can domesticate
[13:08] pythons and make them pets and they let
[13:11] the python sleep next to them. And a
[13:13] python is so well behaved. It sleeps
[13:15] next to you.
[13:17] Here in Africa, we know it's sizing you
[13:20] up
[13:21] &gt;&gt; because as it grows, it checks the
[13:23] length of your body to know when the
[13:25] time will come when it can swallow you
[13:27] whole.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; It's not being kind and a nice pet. It's
[13:32] sizing you up. So this is the thing you
[13:35] when you attract these things in and you
[13:38] think you can control them instead of
[13:40] putting them under subjection of the
[13:42] word you end up with these
[13:43] manifestations becoming rife. So let's
[13:46] go to the first quote from sir we would
[13:48] see Jesus page 35 paragraph 1. This is
[13:50] 1961.
[13:52] If he's a true disciple of Christ he'll
[13:54] lead you to the cross. Oh brother
[13:56] Brandham I went out and spoke in
[13:57] tongues. That don't mean nothing. A mule
[14:00] did that one day. Yes sir. That's you.
[14:03] Yeah, I don't mean to make fun of God's
[14:05] holy word. I believe in speaking in
[14:06] tonesues, but devils speak with tongues.
[14:10] A people can speak in tonesues and live
[14:12] any kind of a life. But I mean that the
[14:15] devil's got a copy of everything that
[14:19] God did.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; And he can copy everything but the
[14:23] genuine birth of Christ.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; He can't do that
[14:28] &gt;&gt; cuz you have to die first. When the word
[14:30] raises you up, how do you know when
[14:31] you're alive? When that word, every word
[14:34] of it made flesh in you. Everything that
[14:36] the Bible says, you say the same thing
[14:39] and it comes to pass just exactly like
[14:41] he said it. That's when it is when your
[14:43] spirit agrees with him. Here's the word.
[14:47] When your spirit agrees with what he
[14:48] said and the spirit makes itself
[14:50] manifest through his word, then you're
[14:52] living. You're through shopping then and
[14:56] swapping.
[14:57] Shopping and swapping. That means you're
[14:59] not buying something and returning and
[15:01] buying something and returning. You've
[15:02] got the real thing.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; It's all settled. Amen. Uh, and the next
[15:07] quote, God being misunderstood, page
[15:09] 609, par um, I think it's paragraph 609.
[15:14] Yeah. Listen. Now, I'm going to say
[15:16] something that's going to really stab
[15:18] you for a minute. So, just sit still
[15:20] just a moment. See, that's how I speak.
[15:24] The Holy Spirit can speak through a
[15:27] hypocrite.
[15:28] Exactly. I've seen it done. And I can
[15:31] prove you by the scripture that that's
[15:33] right. I can prove to you by the
[15:36] scripture that demon powers take up
[15:39] those spirits and use them. Sure, they
[15:42] take up those gifts and use them.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; So, you can have a genuinely gifted
[15:48] person who at other times spoke by the
[15:51] Holy Ghost and the enemy can take up
[15:54] that gift and use it.
[15:57] I've stood right seen devils speak in
[15:59] tongues and interpret. I've seen
[16:00] hypocrites take the genuine Holy Spirit
[16:03] and speak with it. That's the reason you
[16:06] can't say that speaking in tongues is
[16:08] the only evidence of the Holy Ghost. All
[16:11] right? So, usually when you are asked
[16:15] about the gifts of the Holy Ghost, we
[16:17] tend to be as respectful as possible,
[16:19] not to offend people, but even worse, we
[16:22] don't want to offend the Holy Ghost.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. when you know when we grew up in
[16:26] the church and uh I I just when I look
[16:30] at the the Sunday school kids and the
[16:32] youth today they looks they're so
[16:34] protected they're so unaware they just
[16:37] never seen it we we grew up in churches
[16:40] you would see exisms happening on Sunday
[16:43] morning you know like casting out a
[16:45] devils and most of these kids haven't
[16:48] seen that if they were they'd jump out
[16:51] of their skin I'm sure but we we There
[16:54] would be like four or five year olds
[16:55] sitting there while you had this prayer
[16:57] line and these people would come up some
[16:58] for healing and then all of a sudden
[17:00] somebody would manifest and that's what
[17:02] we would call it manifest. We didn't
[17:04] even know what that meant when we were
[17:06] kids but he's manifesting
[17:08] anyway but and immediately your mother
[17:11] shuts you down. Close your eyes. Keep
[17:13] your eyes closed, you know. And if you
[17:16] open your eyes, why are you opening your
[17:19] eyes? And I'm like, why are you opening
[17:20] your eyes?
[17:22] You know, so how do you know my eyes are
[17:25] open? If you hadn't seen me, but don't
[17:28] open your eyes. And then they frighten
[17:30] you after they tell you if your eyes are
[17:31] open, the devil can jump into you. Will
[17:33] jump out of that person and jump into
[17:35] you. And you can imagine after all the
[17:38] stories you hear about demon possession
[17:40] and people and and the stuff they went
[17:43] through and how they fainted and the one
[17:45] was frothing at the mouth and the one
[17:46] two kick the guy over this couch and you
[17:49] know and out the door and the power was
[17:51] so strong and I tell you what people
[17:53] love to brag about the devil's power
[17:57] &gt;&gt; and we would be sitting there listening
[17:58] to them and thinking wow that devil is
[18:01] really dangerous you know and yet never
[18:04] seen such things in the message. We saw
[18:07] it in Pentecost.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; And um strangely the message people who
[18:12] came the people who came from Pentecost
[18:14] accepted the message, they were not
[18:16] happy with this church that is just mild
[18:20] and where demons really didn't want to
[18:22] come in. They were happier if we brought
[18:25] demons in for these guys to exercise
[18:28] their faith muscles. And uh I'm not
[18:31] kidding you, they loved it. They they
[18:33] used to get high on it.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; And um so my point is we were trained to
[18:41] not offend the Holy Ghost. If someone
[18:44] spoke in tongues, shush, quiet, don't
[18:47] say it. Just let it go. And we're
[18:49] sitting
[18:50] waiting for it to end. Waiting. And then
[18:53] we're waiting for them to tell us
[18:54] something dramatic. And then it's just
[18:56] like they recite some verse, you know,
[18:59] from the Bible. And um we we were like
[19:03] that's so anticlimactic.
[19:05] You know, the whole pressure comes down
[19:08] and they're speaking in tongues and
[19:10] they'll, you know, stand up and they're
[19:12] saying stuff and it's all like like
[19:14] gibberish. We don't know what they're
[19:15] saying and then they send out this
[19:18] mediocre message. You know, I'm just
[19:21] tell I'm being as truthful as I can be.
[19:23] I was a kid growing up in the church.
[19:25] When I say mediocre, I mean, why did the
[19:27] Holy Ghost have to speak that way just
[19:29] to recite a verse which we could have
[19:30] just spoken about in English?
[19:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:34] &gt;&gt; You know, or just tell you, I the Lord
[19:37] your God, I'm telling you to that you're
[19:39] listening to this message today, you
[19:41] must keep it and hold it by faith and
[19:44] believe it with all your heart and and
[19:46] uh do not stray from it. You mean that's
[19:48] it?
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[19:51] So you can imagine my character
[19:55] questioning everything. How the people
[19:58] can tell you you have a questioning
[20:00] devil on you, you know.
[20:05] So we've been always taught that the
[20:08] Holy Spirit is gentle. He's like a dove
[20:12] and he does not descend upon wolf
[20:14] nature. He's a gentleman
[20:16] &gt;&gt; and does not you remember the lamb and
[20:18] the dove message and he does not force
[20:21] himself upon you. He's a gentleman.
[20:25] We've been taught in the message to be
[20:27] so respectful to say to not say anything
[20:31] against someone who is speaking with
[20:33] tongues or prophesying or some kind of
[20:35] gift in case we offend the Holy Spirit.
[20:39] And it was drilled into us when we were
[20:41] young, right? Some of you been through
[20:43] that.
[20:44] It's almost like they were grooming us
[20:47] to respect them
[20:50] when they even lied to us.
[20:53] Because I can tell you looking back now
[20:55] and knowing what I know about the word,
[20:57] I can tell you I've seen a lot of fakers
[21:00] who took advantage of the Christian
[21:02] church and the message church. And they
[21:04] were fakers because they learned to fake
[21:06] it in the denomination and they came and
[21:07] brought that stuff in here and it wasn't
[21:10] the real deal.
[21:11] I can tell you now as as solid as I can
[21:15] tell you they were fakers. It was not
[21:17] the real thing.
[21:20] Um because if it doesn't line up with
[21:21] the word, it's not right.
[21:25] So the problem is we had to just take,
[21:27] you know, this rain, the rain falls in
[21:29] the just and the unjust. We had to
[21:30] respect all of them, even the bad guys.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; And the bad guys benefited the most
[21:37] because they're bad guys and they're
[21:39] covering up. They're using gifts of the
[21:41] Holy Ghost to cover up who they really
[21:42] are. And it worked for them. They
[21:45] benefited. Some of them benefited from
[21:47] it financially.
[21:50] So we um you know in the Bible we saw
[21:54] this lamb of God, right? You know the
[21:57] dove rest on the lamb and the lamb is
[21:59] led to the sacrificial cross and he
[22:01] openeth not his mouth. That's the lamb
[22:05] nature. That's what we are preached at.
[22:07] We must have that. you know, resistance
[22:09] comes against us. You must not open. You
[22:12] must just take it. And then we saw this
[22:14] lamb in Matthew 23
[22:17] who smacked these Pharisees around. He
[22:20] called them all sorts of things. He
[22:23] called out their clothing, how they sit
[22:25] in the church, how they take the best
[22:27] seats at weddings. He called them asps,
[22:30] vipers, snakes in the grass, hypocrites.
[22:36] &gt;&gt; That's not all. We saw him plat rope and
[22:40] whip them out the temple and kick over
[22:43] tables. I haven't even done that yet in
[22:45] my life.
[22:47] That might bring a whole lot of
[22:48] satisfaction. I can tell you that.
[22:51] But that's the lamb
[22:55] who the dove rested on.
[22:58] &gt;&gt; So to me, there's a there's a whole lot
[23:00] more that goes with this lamb.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:03] &gt;&gt; Right. this lamb nature and this Holy
[23:06] Ghost gentle spirit.
[23:08] So yet when he met when Christ he uh the
[23:12] same gentle Holy Spirit in him, he did
[23:15] this. He whipped them out the temple. He
[23:18] called them out when they were being
[23:20] untruthful, when they were deceiving the
[23:23] others. He called them out when they
[23:25] were remember the one person uh even
[23:28] questioned him about tithing and
[23:30] offerings. And can you imagine telling
[23:32] somebody, you see that widow, she gave
[23:35] just so much. She's given more than you.
[23:38] Can you imagine me saying that to
[23:40] somebody? They'll kick me out. But this
[23:43] is Christ. That lamb nature is calling
[23:45] you out right where it hurts.
[23:49] I see so much of that in the scripture.
[23:53] And yet when he met unrighteous people,
[23:56] he could have been as gentle as
[23:57] anything. When I say unrighteous people,
[24:00] he could have been rough with others,
[24:02] but he meets the woman at the well. He
[24:05] meets the woman in the street who is
[24:06] about to be stoned, women that lived in
[24:09] sin and and men and others who were
[24:12] discarded as trash by the church.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; And he speaks to them with great
[24:18] gentleness and respect.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Told them and and they were shocked
[24:23] because they were their thoughts were,
[24:25] "Why are you speaking to me?" They've
[24:28] gotten so accomplished by by being
[24:30] downtrodden by the church and here is
[24:32] Messiah the lamb speaking to them with
[24:35] such respect.
[24:37] And he told them the truth. He didn't
[24:39] just tell them, "Oh, you poor thing. You
[24:41] know, you've done wrong and don't worry.
[24:43] We know how bad people are. You come to
[24:45] my church, we'll be good to you. We'll
[24:48] hug you. We'll bring you in." No, he
[24:50] didn't do that. He said, "Go and sin no
[24:52] more. Your sins are forgiven. Don't do
[24:55] this again."
[24:56] He was gracious. He had grace. He had
[24:59] love. But he told him the truth. And the
[25:02] truth was, you did a bad thing. You've
[25:04] been living a bad life. He said, "I know
[25:07] you had five husbands and the one you're
[25:09] living with," he isn't. He didn't just
[25:10] sit there and say, "Oh, you poor thing.
[25:11] Come here. Come bring it in. Let me give
[25:13] you a hug." Told him the truth. This is
[25:16] the thing about this land. It's more
[25:18] about the truth than anything. Amen. And
[25:20] then feelings.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Right? So when I look at what is being
[25:24] done and described in this question as
[25:27] described in this question I cannot
[25:30] believe that's the Holy Spirit and that
[25:33] the Holy Spirit would come upon someone
[25:36] to divulge other people's mistakes in a
[25:40] public place
[25:43] today when we have the word speaking to
[25:45] us and moreover young girls
[25:50] I just want to say This happens mostly
[25:52] with young girls.
[25:54] And those girls are mostly troubled
[25:56] young girls.
[25:59] That's that to me is already red flags
[26:01] that ministers should be knowing,
[26:06] right? So I cannot believe that the Holy
[26:08] Spirit would do that to to and and make
[26:10] a show of calling out people's sin like
[26:14] that. And uh it just shows and why would
[26:18] the Holy Spirit have to use such flawed
[26:21] individuals
[26:23] to do that, right? The reason I cannot
[26:26] see this happening is because I know the
[26:29] effects it has on the people who are
[26:32] supposedly speaking by the Holy Spirit.
[26:35] So if if the Holy Spirit is speaking
[26:38] through a Christ centered person and not
[26:41] a troubled person, the person has the
[26:44] word, the person has the maturity to
[26:46] deal with that gift. But when the gift
[26:48] comes upon or the gift comes through a
[26:51] person who is problematic, that person
[26:54] starts being lifted up in pride and it
[26:58] starts damaging that person. And then
[27:00] you'll end uh I'm going to explain to
[27:02] you. I'm going to tell you because I've
[27:03] been in the church my whole life. I'm
[27:05] going to tell you how it operates. Okay?
[27:08] We've seen it too often. What happens is
[27:11] if that person is not word centered and
[27:14] anchored, a religious spirit takes over
[27:18] them
[27:19] and they start to attract attention to
[27:22] themselves and they love the attention.
[27:25] They love the authority they're using
[27:27] and they become sociopaths
[27:31] &gt;&gt; in the church. People who will
[27:33] manipulate everyone for their own gain.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Be very, very, very careful.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:42] All right. So, archangels, let's get to
[27:46] that first. There's too much in the B
[27:49] there. there, you know, there's not too
[27:52] much in the Bible about archangels, but
[27:55] there's a lot everywhere else in
[27:56] folklore. Okay? So, the origin of
[28:00] archangels comes from Jewish folklore,
[28:04] and the Jews learned it in Babylon when
[28:06] they were in captivity. In other words,
[28:09] you're not going to find in the Bible
[28:11] where the Lord says, "Well, I have my my
[28:15] henchmen, the archangels first and then
[28:19] below them is the next set of angels who
[28:22] are, you know, the managers, the floor
[28:25] managers, and then after that is all the
[28:27] other angels."
[28:29] There's no such thing
[28:32] immediately. If you have that kind of
[28:34] hierarchy in a celestial dimension then
[28:38] you know you are causing trouble
[28:41] right as long as there free will there's
[28:43] going to be trouble right so you will
[28:46] not find any reference of archangels
[28:50] before the captivity of Babylon in the
[28:51] Bible you're not going to find you mean
[28:53] from Genesis all the way up to the
[28:55] captivity of Babylon no mention of
[28:57] archangels
[29:00] &gt;&gt; it tells you if it's from Babylon.
[29:03] That's where it came from.
[29:06] So in the Bible, we only hear about
[29:08] Gabriel twice and Michael four times.
[29:12] Michael the archangel. There's other
[29:14] mentions of Michael, but that was a guy
[29:16] who had the name Michael. We have one of
[29:18] those,
[29:20] right? So Michael is Michael is the only
[29:24] one in the Bible spoken of as the
[29:26] archangel. And that is in the New
[29:28] Testament. Not even Gabriel is called
[29:31] the archangel. So in other in other
[29:34] books that are not mentioned in the
[29:36] Bible, they are books from other Jewish
[29:38] books like the Talmud and so on. Um I I
[29:42] forget what the name of these books are.
[29:44] Um but they there are names of other
[29:47] apparent angels like Raphael
[29:50] and Uriel and Arya and other different
[29:54] kinds of names and and it all ends with
[29:56] eel because that is God. So like Micah,
[30:00] man of God or warrior of God or healer
[30:04] or something, you know, it's it's
[30:05] they're all given designations
[30:08] based on what people thought they should
[30:12] be. But we actually don't know if those
[30:15] angels even existed,
[30:18] right? So
[30:20] for example, the name Gabriel,
[30:23] do you really think God saw an angel and
[30:26] gave him you shall be called Gabriel?
[30:29] The word Gabriel or Gabriel is the
[30:32] messenger of God. So any um entity came
[30:38] to somebody with a message from God, he
[30:41] was called Gabriel because they assumed
[30:44] he's a messenger. He's come with a
[30:46] message. That means if it was a cloud,
[30:48] it was Gabriel. If it was fire, it was
[30:50] Gabriel. If it was some other man who
[30:54] came with the message from directly from
[30:56] God, it was Gabriel. But if it was a man
[30:59] who stood up for the saints of God, he
[31:01] was Michael.
[31:03] If it was a man who uh was fighting for
[31:06] the people, it was Michael.
[31:08] This is why even the prophet gives that
[31:10] designation to Christ that Christ is
[31:13] Michael. Yeah.
[31:14] &gt;&gt; So, how is Christ Michael and King
[31:16] Theophony and the two different people?
[31:20] &gt;&gt; See, so there there's a lot I could say
[31:23] about angels, but I would rather not say
[31:25] it now because there's a there's a a
[31:28] need to speak about this in a full
[31:30] teaching maybe some other time. But I
[31:32] will say this that people who fall prey
[31:35] to such things
[31:37] and I let me let me put it this way.
[31:41] A church that is being affected by this
[31:45] is doing so because another spirit is
[31:48] among them.
[31:51] Okay. And for this to me I think people
[31:54] who get confused about manifestations
[31:56] who are led astray by manifestations to
[31:59] me they do not understand dimensions and
[32:02] demonology
[32:05] for if if you are a people and
[32:07] especially in Africa. Africa is heavily
[32:10] Africa, India, wherever you were idol
[32:13] worshippers and ancestral worshippers,
[32:15] you are prone to such things because
[32:18] your your ancestors terrified you. You
[32:21] are afraid of your shadows.
[32:23] You're afraid of the dark. You're afraid
[32:25] of the dead. You're afraid of right.
[32:28] This is where you come from. This is who
[32:30] you are. And you must know if your
[32:33] ministers or preachers or spiritual
[32:35] people uh know how it affects you, the
[32:39] enemy can use them to terrify you. And
[32:43] to control you. It's all about control.
[32:46] So there is a serious lack of true
[32:50] honest teaching on demonology in the
[32:52] message. To me, that is the problem.
[32:55] That's where it should start. It is one
[32:57] thing to know about what the Holy Ghost
[33:00] is and not being able to tell between
[33:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[33:04] person of the Holy Ghost. And then there
[33:07] is not knowing the difference between
[33:08] the Holy Ghost and demonology.
[33:14] Did I say that enough?
[33:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, we're having this conversation
[33:18] in the world now where people don't know
[33:20] what the Holy Ghost is and the baptism
[33:22] of the Holy Ghost.
[33:23] You know, we we've got to define that
[33:25] the difference between the anointing and
[33:27] the person. But how can you not know the
[33:29] difference between the Holy Ghost and a
[33:30] demon?
[33:34] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. It's just crazy
[33:36] that this is still being accepted in
[33:38] message churches. So, you should be able
[33:41] to discern when you are when you are
[33:45] manipulated by sociopaths.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[33:50] &gt;&gt; you should. And I'm telling you, I want
[33:51] to give you a warning. Parents, your
[33:55] children today are being bred to be
[33:57] sociopaths by the world.
[34:01] You may not see this, but I do.
[34:04] It's coming. All of your children are
[34:07] being taught to be victims and to
[34:10] manipulate victim status.
[34:13] You got a child sitting in your house,
[34:16] sitting around and acting like they're a
[34:18] victim of anything, they need a good
[34:21] spanking.
[34:23] That's the truth. This sitting around
[34:25] moping and being the incredible sulk,
[34:28] you know, and uh slamming doors and
[34:31] throwing pillows and throwing tantrums.
[34:34] That's a sociopath in the making because
[34:38] that is a child learning to use their
[34:40] emotions to manipulate you to get you to
[34:43] do something and you succumb once and
[34:46] you're done for.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; Cuz every time they smile that pretty
[34:49] face and bat those lashes and then you
[34:51] go you will let them do something
[34:53] against the word.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't stop there. They'll bring
[34:57] that stuff into the church
[35:00] &gt;&gt; and it's mostly young girls.
[35:05] Young boys nowadays it's happening too
[35:08] because they're feminizing young boys to
[35:10] see young boys become drama queens. I'm
[35:13] telling you it's just amazing
[35:16] to that doesn't have a spine anymore.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; Everything is mopey and I'm a victim and
[35:23] this happened to me because it was
[35:26] somebody else's fault. It wasn't my
[35:29] fault and didn't just manipulate the
[35:32] situation. Men of God are responsible.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; We take accountability for what we've
[35:40] done. We recognize our faults. We put it
[35:42] right. We don't blame other people. We
[35:44] we look at ourselves. We make ourselves
[35:47] better.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; This idea that is happening. And I'm
[35:50] telling you, you listen, sociopathy and
[35:53] psychopathy is demonology.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:56] Don't make them psychology. It's
[35:58] demonology. So if you anything to do
[36:01] with lying and manipulation, however it
[36:04] is in children, you you parents should
[36:07] know you come into this world speaking
[36:10] lies. Start there. What does that mean?
[36:12] That means they are going to be
[36:14] sensitive to demonology
[36:16] &gt;&gt; because you are a soul and the first
[36:18] thing that can attract your soul is the
[36:20] fifth dimension. The first thing that's
[36:22] going to get you at schools and
[36:23] universities is the fifth dimension. You
[36:26] do not allow this to continue. And this
[36:28] manipulation at home will come into the
[36:30] church. They'll get married and they'll
[36:32] use manipulation on their husbands and
[36:34] wives.
[36:38] People, young people, children should
[36:40] learn the value of truth. Tell the
[36:43] truth. The truth shall set you free from
[36:46] demonology.
[36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[36:49] &gt;&gt; So this is why you got these young girls
[36:52] in the churches and I don't know why I
[36:55] mean why why does the Holy Spirit not
[36:58] touch you outside when you're with
[37:00] somebody in private to talk to them? Why
[37:03] does it have to be where you can make a
[37:04] show?
[37:10] &gt;&gt; That already tells me you can't bluff
[37:13] me. The moment you start making a show,
[37:16] I know exactly who you are because
[37:18] whatever you do can be done in a
[37:20] dignified way and a way in which is
[37:24] behind it's on line with the word. It's
[37:27] not compromising the values of the word
[37:29] and it's telling the truth and it's got
[37:31] concern for someone.
[37:35] So be aware of that. That wasn't in my
[37:37] notes, but I'm telling you, I see it
[37:39] coming. I see it happening. I travel
[37:42] around the world. When you get to
[37:43] airports and you see people throwing
[37:45] their toys out the cart and I'm looking
[37:46] at this and I'm think there's a like a
[37:48] 42 year old woman acting like she's 7
[37:51] years old
[37:53] and I could see already she never had
[37:55] any protoplasma stimulation when she was
[37:57] growing up.
[37:59] She definitely was allowed to do
[38:01] anything she wanted to do and which is
[38:04] why you are 42 years old throwing your
[38:06] toys off the court right now in front of
[38:08] everybody. You don't care whether there
[38:10] are cameras, whether people are
[38:11] watching. You don't care. This is victim
[38:14] status. This is becoming fashionable.
[38:17] And and the worst part is other people
[38:19] stand back and let this happen
[38:22] because you can't say anything. You just
[38:25] say something, that spirit comes
[38:26] straight back at you, targets on you.
[38:28] They will follow you
[38:30] to video you and shame you.
[38:34] That's already demonology. A new kind of
[38:36] demonology in this world.
[38:39] Be careful.
[38:41] You should be able to tell in your life
[38:44] when you are being manipulated by
[38:46] narcissists from your pulpit and lied to
[38:49] by those wanting your affection and your
[38:52] attention and your financial support.
[38:56] People who tell you the truth are not
[38:58] afraid of losing control.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; They're not afraid of losing support.
[39:03] People who tell the truth don't want to
[39:04] control you. People who tell the truth
[39:07] want you to live your own life and you
[39:08] let me live my own life. I have no
[39:10] reason to control you. If I want to
[39:13] control you, it means I want to benefit
[39:15] from something you can give me.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; People who tell the truth are not
[39:20] interested in control. They value the
[39:23] fact that you are in control of your own
[39:24] life and that I am in control of my own
[39:27] life. People who tell the truth are the
[39:29] ones if you fellowship with them because
[39:32] they walk in the light. You walk in the
[39:34] light.
[39:36] Something amazing written about Michael
[39:38] in the book of Jude is that when he was
[39:40] contending with Satan for the body of
[39:43] Moses, he
[39:45] brought not railing words of accusation.
[39:47] Let's read
[39:51] Jude 1:8-13.
[39:53] Likewise, all these filthy dreamers
[39:55] defile the flesh, despise dominion, and
[39:57] speak evil of dignities. Yet Michael the
[40:00] archangel when contending with the devil
[40:02] he disputed about the body of Moses does
[40:05] not bring against him railing accusation
[40:07] but said the Lord rebuke thee but these
[40:10] in other words I'm not going to say
[40:12] anything against you let the Lord do
[40:14] that
[40:15] those these look at how he brings a
[40:18] contrast of Michael the archangel versus
[40:23] victims modernday sociopaths
[40:27] these speak evil of things they know
[40:30] not, but what they know naturally as
[40:33] brute beasts, in those things they
[40:36] corrupt themselves. Woe unto them, for
[40:39] they have gone in the way of Cain and
[40:41] ran greedily after the era of Balum for
[40:44] a reward. In other words, they have
[40:46] financial concerns. That's the way of
[40:49] Balum. And perished in the gains of
[40:52] Kora. Balum was after financial support.
[40:56] Kora was after fame.
[40:58] These are the these are spots. In other
[41:01] words, these people are spots, their
[41:04] blemishes,
[41:06] their disease in your feasts of charity.
[41:10] When they feast with you, feeding
[41:13] themselves without fear, they are clouds
[41:16] they are without water, carried about of
[41:20] winds, trees whose fruit witherth
[41:23] without fruit, twice dead. Who can be
[41:25] twice dead?
[41:27] Twice dead, plucked up by the roots.
[41:30] This is an absolute
[41:33] lambastic
[41:35] raging waves of the sea, foaming out
[41:38] their own shame, wandering stars to whom
[41:41] is reserved the blackness of darkness
[41:43] forever. Notice how the scripture is
[41:46] referring to the character of people
[41:48] comparing it with the character of
[41:49] someone who is an actual messenger of
[41:51] God. In other words, he's saying Michael
[41:54] the Archangel had all the authority to
[41:56] rebuke Satan and call him out and tell
[41:58] him what he feels like and he didn't
[42:01] while contending for the body of Moses.
[42:03] But you have people who in the church
[42:06] contend for the silliest of things and
[42:08] act like they're the archangel.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm Why am I reading this?
[42:14] Because I'm saying why would Michael the
[42:16] Archangel incarnate himself in someone
[42:19] and do that to other people?
[42:22] Why not use the Holy Spirit and go
[42:24] outside? If you if God has revealed to
[42:26] you that someone has done something
[42:28] wrong, go call them out in private and
[42:30] talk to them. Why does it have to be a
[42:33] show? Something is wrong.
[42:37] And Jude is basically saying that if you
[42:39] have someone who is a messenger of God
[42:41] who has all the ability and authority to
[42:44] act out and condemn someone but doesn't
[42:49] this is my point and I'm not saying this
[42:51] for any other reason. I grew up as a in
[42:54] a very protected life. I I did not
[42:57] drink. I did not smoke. I did not
[42:59] fornicate. I did not have girlfriends. I
[43:01] didn't go to parties. I I lived a clean
[43:04] life in the message and I have more
[43:08] compassion for people than other people
[43:10] who have done all those things and come
[43:12] into the message.
[43:14] I have seen people who lived sinful
[43:16] lives, drank, smoked, drug, fornicated,
[43:19] adultery, all of that come into the
[43:20] message and become super legalist till
[43:23] they cannot even have compassion for
[43:26] other people who are going through what
[43:28] they did. But someone like me has more
[43:31] compassion. I don't understand this.
[43:34] In fact, you should be the one who
[43:36] should have compassion because you know
[43:38] what those people went through.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; You went through that. You can associate
[43:42] with that.
[43:44] To me, when you do that, something is
[43:47] wrong.
[43:48] You need a character change.
[43:52] So when you have someone else like these
[43:55] he is describing in verse 10 to13 who
[43:58] take no thought whatsoever to malign the
[44:02] character and testimony of others
[44:04] publicly in short I don't believe that
[44:07] any angel or Christ would incarnate
[44:09] themsself in a person in the first place
[44:12] to speak through them there's no reason
[44:15] to do that there is no reason for Christ
[44:18] himself to incarnate himself in a person
[44:21] to call about somebody else when the
[44:23] Holy Ghost is here. That's the Holy
[44:25] Ghost designation. That is the reason
[44:28] why the Holy Ghost was sent upon the
[44:29] church. We have because we have the Holy
[44:32] Ghost present, the baptism of the Holy
[44:33] Ghost, the person of the Holy Ghost. We
[44:35] do not need any incarnation of any
[44:38] celestial being whatsoever.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; Also, this gift is not mentioned in in 1
[44:47] Corinthians 12 as part of the nine
[44:48] gifts.
[44:50] We have wisdom, knowledge, healing,
[44:53] tongues, prophecies. We do not have
[44:54] incarnation of angels in there.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to come back to this. These
[45:02] manifestations and I want to explain
[45:03] this properly because I want you to
[45:05] understand uh this carefully. This these
[45:10] manifestations have always
[45:13] from many years. I'm talking about
[45:15] hundreds of years come through
[45:19] uh young girls,
[45:22] right? I mean, those of you who in
[45:25] school and and studied The Crucible
[45:26] would know what I'm talking about,
[45:29] right? I know that they made The
[45:30] Crucible. It was a book and made it into
[45:33] a movie. But people understand what
[45:36] happened in that time where it it it uh
[45:41] I think this was run about the time when
[45:43] it was it could have been set in the
[45:45] time of uh the the the Salem witch
[45:48] trials, right? Yeah. which was a big
[45:51] thing to think that you had people
[45:56] especially young girls
[45:58] who suddenly received the Holy Spirit
[46:01] and call out the sins of other people
[46:04] and made the church act to hang those
[46:08] people
[46:10] to execute them publicly.
[46:14] It's no difference.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; It's exactly the same thing. So what is
[46:19] the problem? get to the root of the
[46:20] problem. Why is it young girls? What's
[46:22] wrong with the boys? They're not getting
[46:24] the holy girls. What's going on? Huh?
[46:27] It's only the young girls. And then go
[46:30] to those young girls and find out and
[46:32] you'll find out a very troubling issue.
[46:35] Okay? From my experience over 40 years
[46:38] in this message, these young girls who
[46:40] are touched in inverted commas by the
[46:42] Holy Spirit are usually rebellious,
[46:46] moody, temperamental, unstable,
[46:50] problematic, and their families will
[46:53] attest to that,
[46:55] right?
[46:57] And very often, more often than not,
[47:01] some of those young girls have been
[47:03] abused by a family member or somebody in
[47:06] the church or they are being groomed by
[47:09] somebody in the church. They could be
[47:11] sexually abused, physically abused,
[47:14] verbally abused. They have a terrible
[47:16] terrible
[47:18] uh what do you call it's like a um
[47:21] complex
[47:22] uh u a low self-esteem complex put on
[47:25] them and they are being controlled. Now
[47:27] for you to understand what a gift is. Do
[47:30] you know what's a gift? A gift is an
[47:33] ability. Do you know why people have
[47:36] abilities?
[47:38] Gifts of sensitivities.
[47:42] Why would a person have the sensitivity
[47:46] to know who is a sexual predator?
[47:51] Right? But because they themselves have
[47:54] been affected by one.
[47:57] And if you grow up from childhood having
[48:00] had more and more effects of it, you've
[48:03] been abused, you've been constantly
[48:04] abused, you get a sensitivity to no one.
[48:10] That's a gift that becomes a gift that
[48:13] can be used but it's grounded in
[48:15] emotionalism
[48:17] that that sense to discern. Now often
[48:21] times you can be wrong.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; And that's where you need the guidance
[48:26] of the Holy Ghost to tune that gift.
[48:30] Right? So this is this is what we've
[48:32] seen from experience in the church
[48:35] Pentecostal church. I've been in
[48:36] Pentecost for a very short time as a as
[48:39] a child and then come into the message.
[48:41] So, and I've been acquainted with both
[48:42] sides, I can tell you. Right. So, very
[48:47] often they've been abused by family
[48:49] members, high-ranking members in the
[48:50] church and u uh their mouth has been
[48:55] shut by their abusers.
[48:58] The only way they can act out is to be
[49:00] touched
[49:02] by the spirit.
[49:07] And it's not going to take long they're
[49:08] going to expose the person who is
[49:10] controlling them.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; That's how it starts. It's really a cry
[49:15] for help.
[49:18] This is the trigger that the problem
[49:20] that these girls don't realize it's a
[49:22] trigger for demonology because if you if
[49:26] it was a cry for help and somebody paid
[49:28] attention and the truth came out then
[49:30] they're set free. Then there's no need
[49:32] for the act anymore. there's no need for
[49:34] the show. But if nobody's answering that
[49:36] need, it's going the show is going to
[49:38] become stronger and greater and more
[49:41] flashy and more flamboyant and before
[49:43] you know it, they're going to destroy a
[49:45] lot of people's lives. Very dangerous,
[49:48] right? And so most likely what is
[49:51] happening with these young girls is this
[49:53] is they've got no discernment. There's
[49:55] no angel telling them the lives of other
[49:57] people. Arms eraser,
[50:02] not Walton's eraser. Arms. You know what
[50:06] that means?
[50:07] Think about it. How do they logically
[50:10] How do they know about the lives of
[50:12] other people?
[50:14] Somebody told them.
[50:16] That's what it is. Somebody told them.
[50:19] It's usually the person grooming them or
[50:23] a high ranking member in the church or
[50:25] they are privy to conversations.
[50:28] And it's so easy. And in this day, so
[50:32] many of you young people can become
[50:33] prophets and prophetesses
[50:35] &gt;&gt; simply because you're good with this.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; You are investigating people's statuses
[50:43] and people's profiles on Facebook and
[50:48] Instagram and all of that. And then you
[50:50] come out and you think you're going to
[50:51] bluff me with with discerning somebody
[50:54] when all all it is you knew what
[50:56] happened to them last week on social
[50:57] media,
[51:02] &gt;&gt; right? Don't do that. This isn't a place
[51:05] to clown.
[51:07] &gt;&gt; When we are here in the presence of the
[51:09] word, this isn't a place to lie. When
[51:12] you do that, you open yourself up, your
[51:15] soul up to the fifth dimension. You
[51:17] don't want to go down that path.
[51:21] This is a simple truth in the track
[51:23] record of these manifestations. There
[51:25] there are ministers all over the world.
[51:28] I took a long time to answer this
[51:29] question. I got this question over 2
[51:31] months ago. I took a long time. I spoke
[51:33] to some friends of mine. I I I listened
[51:36] to some of the ministers who might have
[51:39] been going through some of these things
[51:40] in the area. And every single one who
[51:43] preaches the word, some of them tell me,
[51:45] "Brother, that's demons." It's like no
[51:47] thinking about it. They they know it.
[51:49] Others who speak carefully will tell you
[51:52] I I I um from my perspective I do not
[51:56] see this as the character of the Holy
[51:57] Spirit. Right? So I've had both sides.
[52:00] I've had the guys who shoot from the hip
[52:02] and the guys who are you know really
[52:04] really
[52:06] somber mellow fellows who will tell you
[52:09] no no sir this isn't the the Holy Ghost.
[52:14] So I took a long time to answer this
[52:15] question. And it's simply the truth and
[52:18] the track record of these
[52:19] manifestations. So my advice is correct
[52:23] this immediately before it splits the
[52:26] church and or leave the church and go
[52:29] where the true because you're dealing
[52:30] with demonology on on steroids.
[52:34] Right? Leave the church, go where the
[52:36] true word is being preached and where
[52:38] the true word is the headship of the
[52:40] church. Because if you have the true
[52:41] word as the headship of the church,
[52:43] that's not going to happen.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; Always remember that the true
[52:48] manifestation of the gifts of the Holy
[52:50] Ghost brings an atmosphere of welcoming
[52:54] and being ma making people comfortable.
[52:57] It brings repentance and true love.
[53:01] The the presence of the Holy Ghost
[53:03] should not bring hostility and suspicion
[53:05] and discomfort.
[53:07] Like when we grew up and we had all
[53:09] these gifts around us, we when you get
[53:12] to teenagers like, "Oh my goodness, I
[53:14] hope they don't say something about me,
[53:17] you already got the wrong impression."
[53:19] Because if if the Holy Ghost is about to
[53:22] speak through a gift, it should be,
[53:23] "Lord, it is a message for me. Make me
[53:25] compliant."
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you for that. And thank you.
[53:28] That's the attitude we should be having.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[53:33] &gt;&gt; All right, let's go to question two.
[53:35] Believe me, there's so much more I can
[53:36] say on this and I've done some of it in
[53:38] the series on demonology that we did,
[53:41] but I think we've uh properly answered
[53:44] that question.
[53:46] Uh, question two, in the service you
[53:48] preached on predestination, you spoke of
[53:51] of everything being a consequence of our
[53:53] actions. So, what did it what did a
[53:56] deformed baby do wrong to deserve that?
[53:58] What did a person born with a congenital
[54:01] disease do to deserve it? These were not
[54:05] consequences of their actions. Please
[54:07] explain. Apparently, this is a a
[54:09] question based on a question that might
[54:12] have been asked on the comments in the
[54:15] YouTube videos. All right. So, I'm not
[54:18] sure. I I can't have the time to go back
[54:21] and see what I was preaching about, but
[54:23] apparently I was talking about
[54:25] predestination and free will and so on.
[54:27] And I assume it was a subject on
[54:29] predestination from what the question
[54:32] says. I just don't I don't remember
[54:34] preaching a particular message on it,
[54:37] but it could have been in something
[54:39] else. I can't remember what it is. But
[54:41] if I was talking about the concept of
[54:43] free will, which is a subject I love and
[54:45] I I love to talk about because I feel
[54:47] more people need to understand it. The
[54:49] prophet said, "You are the boss of your
[54:52] own soul."
[54:54] &gt;&gt; Nobody, not the devil, not God forces
[54:57] you to make a choice. Okay? You are
[55:00] convinced to make a choice and you look
[55:04] to be convinced to make a choice.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; In with with humans today, we so
[55:12] distrust our own choices. We have to
[55:14] phone a friend. We have to ask a spouse.
[55:17] We have to check with our children. We
[55:19] have to check with our mother. We check
[55:21] with our father. We check with people.
[55:22] Am I making the right choice? Because
[55:24] we're afraid of what? The consequences.
[55:27] Right? So everything within your life I
[55:31] want to say it this way if I didn't say
[55:33] it clearly whenever I spoke about this
[55:36] and and I get I get the question like uh
[55:39] if if everything that we are doing that
[55:41] that we go through is a consequence of
[55:43] our choices then uh what did a baby do
[55:47] an innocent baby being born through its
[55:49] mother and come out with a disease they
[55:50] didn't like eat hamburgers or drink soda
[55:54] pop and you know and get sugar diabetes
[55:56] it was passed down by the mother So how
[55:58] can it be their fault? Well, obviously
[56:00] it's not. Right? So I'm going to say it
[56:03] as clear as possible. Everything within
[56:06] your life after you become conscious of
[56:09] choice is a result of your choices.
[56:13] Everything. Remember I I spoke to you
[56:16] and you say, "Well, I had an accident.
[56:19] How can it, you know, somebody crashed
[56:21] into my car. They were coming from that
[56:23] direction. How is it my choice?
[56:26] It was somebody else's fault. But your
[56:28] choice was driving on that road on that
[56:31] day.
[56:33] If you chose another road, you wouldn't
[56:35] have hit that one.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; You Everything you do is a consequence
[56:40] of your choice.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; You can't run away from that.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; And and you you can't even call it bad
[56:47] luck
[56:49] cuz I don't know if such a thing exists.
[56:53] You make a choice. You can be walking
[56:56] through the pavilion mall and you cho
[56:59] you choose to go into this store based
[57:01] on a thought that came into your head
[57:02] based on somebody messaging you on your
[57:04] phone to tell you they need something.
[57:06] Somebody told you they need something
[57:08] and you made the choice, let me turn and
[57:09] then the store gets hijacked or robbed
[57:12] and you happen to be in there. Is it the
[57:14] person's fault for asking you for
[57:17] something from that store?
[57:20] You could have said, "Well, I'll get
[57:21] that tomorrow."
[57:23] No, they want it now. Oh, they forced
[57:25] me. You still made a choice.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Right. The point is the reason why I
[57:33] speak about this is because more and
[57:35] more in this day in this culture of
[57:39] victims and snowflakes.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; We blame God. If you can't blame anyone,
[57:44] you blame God,
[57:46] &gt;&gt; right? So blaming God for things that
[57:49] happened to us when we are our uh um you
[57:54] know things that happened to us it's
[57:56] like you can whenever you can't blame
[57:58] somebody else you have to blame God. So
[58:01] if I was born this way it's God's fault.
[58:04] Why is it God's fault?
[58:07] Deformities in children are a result of
[58:10] choices of parents
[58:12] ancestors before us.
[58:15] It's also a fault of your genetics
[58:18] which come from the choices of your
[58:20] generations
[58:22] which is a result of our choices of whom
[58:24] we choose to marry.
[58:28] For example, if I marry a short girl,
[58:33] I am determining the height of my
[58:35] children.
[58:38] It was my choice. I'm not going to marry
[58:40] a short girl and think I'm going to have
[58:41] a basketball player someday.
[58:45] Right.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; God does not interfere with my choices.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; And he's not going to, you know, I'm I'm
[58:52] I'm dreaming now. I really want my boy
[58:54] to play basketball, professional
[58:56] basketball. I want him to be 7 ft tall
[58:58] and then I go marry a short girl and I
[59:00] myself am he high challenged, you know,
[59:02] but it's my dream for them to play. I'm
[59:05] being unrealistic.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; And what must God do? God must must
[59:09] succumb to my dream.
[59:13] That's making light of it to make you
[59:15] understand something. In the same way,
[59:17] when it comes to sickness and death, we
[59:20] must realize and understand it doesn't
[59:22] come from God. Prophet said sickness
[59:24] does not come from God.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Right? He said God is eternal life.
[59:28] Eternal life comes from him. Sickness
[59:30] and death are a consequence of man's
[59:33] choice.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; You choose. In Adam's time, Adam chose
[59:38] to live by his own free will and brought
[59:40] death upon him. From there, every man
[59:43] onwards who chose God's will received
[59:47] eternal life, could receive healing for
[59:50] something. Because we choose to serve
[59:52] God does not make him obligated to
[59:57] remove every sickness from us
[1:00:00] just to end your suffering. That would
[1:00:03] be nice. It would be nice. You know,
[1:00:06] every single headache we just prayed and
[1:00:08] God took it away or toothache. Sometimes
[1:00:11] you need a toothache to tell you to stop
[1:00:13] putting sugar in your mouth.
[1:00:17] Huh? That's the thing. Oh, God, heal me.
[1:00:20] And then I go out and drink a whole lot
[1:00:22] of coke and after I drink Coke, don't
[1:00:25] even brush my teeth. Just go to bed for
[1:00:27] like 8 hours. I mean, come on. I've got
[1:00:30] all that sugar coating your teeth. What
[1:00:32] do you think is going to happen? You
[1:00:33] think God must be this person on walking
[1:00:35] on overdrive. keep my child's teeth
[1:00:38] healthy while he's filling himself with
[1:00:40] Coca-Cola.
[1:00:44] Sometimes you need a good toothache
[1:00:47] and a good few other things. That means
[1:00:51] God only heals you if it benefits his
[1:00:55] word.
[1:00:57] I I want you to understand this. God is
[1:00:59] not interested in anything else
[1:01:02] concerning your life. But where your
[1:01:05] life concerns his word, that's what he's
[1:01:07] concerned.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Let's read demonology, physical realm,
[1:01:11] part of 19. Now, all sickness, we have
[1:01:15] to find first that all sickness came
[1:01:17] from the devil. God is not the author of
[1:01:19] sickness. No sickness comes from God.
[1:01:21] Are you listening? God permits Satan to
[1:01:25] put sickness on you as a whip to bring
[1:01:28] you back to the house of God when you
[1:01:29] disobey him. So God permits the enemy to
[1:01:33] bring sickness.
[1:01:35] He doesn't cause the sickness. But
[1:01:38] sickness in its beginning come from the
[1:01:40] devil. Could you imagine a person would
[1:01:42] believe that God our heavenly father
[1:01:44] would be the author of such a thing as
[1:01:45] sickness and death? Well, no. He isn't.
[1:01:48] Never was, never will be. God permits
[1:01:50] death because of disobedience. God
[1:01:53] permits death. And this is my point.
[1:01:56] When you get to the place where
[1:01:58] something has happened, you have a
[1:01:59] congenital disease, you were born with a
[1:02:01] disease or some disease came from your
[1:02:02] genetics. And listen there there are
[1:02:05] many people I know for every person, one
[1:02:08] person who blames God for that disease.
[1:02:10] There are 100 people who keep on
[1:02:13] praising God and do not lose faith.
[1:02:17] What's your problem?
[1:02:20] Sounds personal to me. If you're blaming
[1:02:22] God, you haven't taken a hold of the
[1:02:24] word yet, right? I mean, you literally
[1:02:27] have an apostle who says, "This thorn in
[1:02:30] my flesh, I've been treated the Lord
[1:02:31] three times. He has not taken it away
[1:02:34] from me well. So, I'm I'm pressing on."
[1:02:38] Three times. The Apostle Paul three
[1:02:40] times. Some of us don't relate, man.
[1:02:44] Like, you got the answer. No, you need
[1:02:46] to keep that that issue with you because
[1:02:48] it's grounding you. No. Oh no. Thousand
[1:02:52] times. Got to go back. Got to go back.
[1:02:54] Got to go back. What are you doing
[1:02:55] wrong? Where's the introspection?
[1:02:58] Sometimes you've got some disease that's
[1:03:00] related to where you living. Move.
[1:03:05] Move.
[1:03:07] Move a house. Move to another city. Do
[1:03:10] something.
[1:03:13] Sometimes it's your diet. Sometimes
[1:03:15] you're not you're not exercising.
[1:03:17] Sometimes it's your genetics. And you
[1:03:19] can't beat your genetics.
[1:03:22] Right? You know, this is why I um I
[1:03:25] believe I've got to spend the next 10
[1:03:27] years of my life working all that I can
[1:03:29] for the gospel and doing what I have to
[1:03:31] do no matter what people say. Because in
[1:03:32] my genetics, all my father's siblings
[1:03:35] all have heart issues. My grandfather,
[1:03:37] his ticker stopped when he was 44 years
[1:03:39] old. What makes me think I'm going to be
[1:03:41] fine? When mine decides to end, it's
[1:03:45] over. I'm okay with that. But while I
[1:03:48] have time, I'm going to work. I'm not
[1:03:50] going to think I'm going to be blessed
[1:03:51] like my mother-in-law is living to past
[1:03:53] 80 or some other brothers are living to
[1:03:55] 90. They got different genetics.
[1:03:58] My genetics tells me you have a time
[1:04:00] limit, my friend.
[1:04:02] I'm okay with that. But I'm going to
[1:04:04] work while I have time.
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to blame God in the hope
[1:04:08] that he's going to keep me alive longer.
[1:04:10] What am I What am I going to do if he
[1:04:12] gives me a life longer?
[1:04:15] It's
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; true.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:18] Since my youth, I've listened to atheist
[1:04:21] verse Christian debates. One of the
[1:04:24] major points of discussion of atheist
[1:04:26] is, "I cannot believe in a God who
[1:04:30] allows suffering in the world." So much
[1:04:33] suffering.
[1:04:34] I've heard many Christians who cannot
[1:04:37] argue back.
[1:04:40] Yeah. But you know this happened because
[1:04:42] I mean what occurred to me is these
[1:04:45] people claim they will only accept God
[1:04:48] if it benefits their lives.
[1:04:51] They assume if there is a God that
[1:04:53] removes sickness and suffering, they
[1:04:55] will return and live righteous and
[1:04:58] worship him. Like if God heals all the
[1:05:00] sickness and takes away all the the
[1:05:03] turmoil and trouble in the world and all
[1:05:04] the suffering of the poor people and
[1:05:06] give everybody food, then all the earth
[1:05:09] people will stand up and worship God.
[1:05:12] That's the biggest lie of the devil
[1:05:14] because everybody knows what happens
[1:05:16] when you get blessed.
[1:05:19] You forget God.
[1:05:22] Brother John read a scripture this
[1:05:23] morning,
[1:05:25] right?
[1:05:27] It's so hard for a rich man to enter the
[1:05:31] kingdom of God. It's it's easier pushing
[1:05:33] a camel through the eye of a needle.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; But with God, all things are possible.
[1:05:38] This is literally telling you if you
[1:05:40] fill the world with blessings, they'll
[1:05:42] turn away from God.
[1:05:45] What a joke. H that shows people don't
[1:05:49] even know God and themselves.
[1:05:53] And but mostly, you know, I want to say
[1:05:55] this
[1:05:57] uh blaming God for suffering in the
[1:06:00] world when it's man's fault is just
[1:06:03] crazy.
[1:06:05] People are suffering in the world
[1:06:06] because it's man's fault, not God.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Every single poverty is caused by man.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; Think of this. You have an earth that is
[1:06:16] fully functional and able to sustain
[1:06:19] every person living on it. You'll not
[1:06:22] find a single animal forming a union to
[1:06:24] complain about poverty.
[1:06:29] Only humans. And who do they blame? God.
[1:06:34] But it's man's fault. Where are these
[1:06:36] atheists holding men to account for the
[1:06:40] suffering in the world? And all these
[1:06:41] atheists who I've seen on debates,
[1:06:43] they're multi-millionaires, they're rich
[1:06:44] people. They they want God to solve the
[1:06:47] problem, but they won't move a finger.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:51] No, no. I'll give money to the research
[1:06:54] of malaria.
[1:06:56] Listen, the natives in Africa have been
[1:06:59] living with malaria for generations. We
[1:07:01] don't need you.
[1:07:03] We don't. You're just experimenting on
[1:07:06] us again and again and again.
[1:07:10] Actually, go to a country and put your
[1:07:12] money where your mouth is and give them
[1:07:13] food. Not malaria injections.
[1:07:19] But this is philanthropy.
[1:07:21] Another joke.
[1:07:23] Mostly people don't understand that to
[1:07:25] be truly God here. You know, I I I play
[1:07:29] this this game with my children. I did
[1:07:31] it to them when they were younger. Now
[1:07:33] they're older. They know my tricks.
[1:07:36] The point is,
[1:07:38] if you were God,
[1:07:41] what would you do?
[1:07:43] Would you grant everybody free will?
[1:07:47] If you were God, what would you do? How
[1:07:50] would you handle free will? You can
[1:07:53] barely handle free will in your own
[1:07:54] house with your children.
[1:07:57] Am I right? With one another. Every one
[1:08:00] of you feels like you need to control
[1:08:02] the other person so you get a better
[1:08:04] result for yourself.
[1:08:06] Can you even imagine being a
[1:08:09] supernatural creator of the universe
[1:08:11] saying you can do whatever you want.
[1:08:16] Your life is in your hands. If you die
[1:08:19] by your hands, I'm okay with that. Can
[1:08:22] you tell that to your children?
[1:08:25] Can you tell that to your wife?
[1:08:28] Oh, no problem, honey. You can drive
[1:08:30] through that place where it's a it's a
[1:08:31] hijacking hot zone. Take I trust you'll
[1:08:34] be okay.
[1:08:37] Right?
[1:08:39] No way. You feel like you know how
[1:08:43] another person's free will should be
[1:08:45] handled. That's the hypocrisy of this.
[1:08:48] You don't know what it means to be God,
[1:08:51] to actually let someone do what they
[1:08:55] choose and allow them to go through the
[1:08:58] consequences. That's a lot of problems
[1:09:00] with with parents today that are
[1:09:02] building snowflakes
[1:09:05] in their children.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; You're you're manipulating the outcome.
[1:09:10] so they can be pleased. So when they are
[1:09:12] pleased, you are pleased.
[1:09:15] You think that's helping them. You're
[1:09:17] not letting them see the consequence of
[1:09:20] their actions. To me, if your son
[1:09:22] doesn't learn for the test, don't cram
[1:09:24] for it. Don't wait up 4 in the morning
[1:09:26] and test him. Let him go and fail. He
[1:09:29] will never do that again.
[1:09:32] You taking hours of your precious sleep
[1:09:34] out to just go and test him till 4 in
[1:09:36] the morning so he can go there and get
[1:09:38] an A and come back. If he comes back,
[1:09:40] I'm telling thank you. I got the A,
[1:09:46] not you. It was my hard work. Because if
[1:09:48] I didn't push you and if I didn't get
[1:09:49] you to do this, you didn't do this. You
[1:09:51] don't deserve it. You're not getting any
[1:09:53] price for it. You're not getting a
[1:09:55] special ice cream for it because I did
[1:09:57] half the work. I should buy me an ice
[1:09:58] cream.
[1:10:02] This is what we're breeding today with
[1:10:03] our children. Pampering, pampering,
[1:10:05] pampering. making sure they get a
[1:10:08] positive outcome. You're breeding
[1:10:10] weakness.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; God doesn't do that to you.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; God allows you your free will, your
[1:10:16] choice, and your actions and your
[1:10:18] consequences. So, you learn from it. You
[1:10:21] become strong. You become independent.
[1:10:23] You you learn accountability.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; You learn shame. You learn
[1:10:27] embarrassment. You become strong from
[1:10:29] it.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; But we keep controlling their outcome.
[1:10:33] The next time somebody teases them,
[1:10:35] meltdown.
[1:10:38] They what? Listen, you have to have some
[1:10:40] weeks where in young people where in one
[1:10:43] week you've got a science project, you
[1:10:45] got an English oral, you got an African
[1:10:47] oral, and you got an exam on Friday.
[1:10:49] It's inhuman to get all of them right.
[1:10:52] Don't go and drink all that rubbish
[1:10:54] monster and all that stuff and take all
[1:10:56] these tablets.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have to wreck your lifespan
[1:11:00] just to get all A's in all four things.
[1:11:03] You can fail one. It's okay.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; See, I can see you don't believe that.
[1:11:16] What's wrong if you fail one? Just pass
[1:11:18] the final exam.
[1:11:20] No, my my entrance to university. You'll
[1:11:23] still get it. You just don't think it
[1:11:26] right now. You'll still get it. Just get
[1:11:29] hard work. What people know when you
[1:11:32] work hard, people can tell when you work
[1:11:34] hard. You can come there with a full
[1:11:36] resume, you know, your your curriculum
[1:11:39] vit and have all the credentials and
[1:11:41] everything. I've got a this and I've got
[1:11:43] that. I've got a metric and they can see
[1:11:45] what you did. You didn't learn the whole
[1:11:47] year. You just crammed for the last.
[1:11:49] They don't want that kind of person.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; They want to and and they are trained on
[1:11:53] the human resources level. They are
[1:11:55] trained when they interview to to they
[1:11:57] got like three psychologists there
[1:11:59] testing you whether you're just someone
[1:12:00] who crammed for even this test. They
[1:12:03] know you. You're not bluffing them.
[1:12:06] Develop a life of accountability and
[1:12:08] responsibility.
[1:12:10] And if you think you're going to get
[1:12:11] through life with your your parents
[1:12:13] always putting a mattress down when you
[1:12:14] fall,
[1:12:17] well, mommy's not going to be there all
[1:12:18] the time.
[1:12:21] All right. I could go on with that one.
[1:12:23] It's one of my favorites.
[1:12:26] Question three.
[1:12:29] We certainly enjoyed the teachings on
[1:12:31] image and likeness of God. There are
[1:12:33] some people who refer to the message,
[1:12:34] who is this Melkisedc? And the quote
[1:12:36] that says, you come like Adam, like me.
[1:12:39] You became from the attribute to the
[1:12:41] flesh to be tempted. He also says, we
[1:12:44] bypassed the theophony. It also
[1:12:47] certainly looks so clear like he says
[1:12:49] that Adam was first made in theophony in
[1:12:51] Genesis 1:26-29 and then made flesh in
[1:12:54] Genesis 2:7 as he says in question and
[1:12:57] answers on Genesis and several other
[1:12:59] places. But how does one explain these
[1:13:02] quotes from who is this MelkiseDC? Okay,
[1:13:06] let me explain.
[1:13:08] Firstly, I want to say I want to begin
[1:13:10] here. When we talk about theophony
[1:13:13] bodies and earthly glorified bodies,
[1:13:17] we are out of our league.
[1:13:20] Okay. When Paul spoke about dimensions,
[1:13:23] he rightly said he didn't know whether
[1:13:26] in the body or without the body. Who
[1:13:28] knows? Only God knows. He said, is that
[1:13:30] right? Let's read 1 Corinthians 15:35-4.
[1:13:33] But some men will say, "How are the dead
[1:13:36] raised up?" This is a different
[1:13:37] scripture. Uh, and with what body do
[1:13:39] they come? Thou fool.
[1:13:43] That which thou seest is not quickened
[1:13:45] except to die? That which thou seest,
[1:13:47] thou seest not that body that shall be,
[1:13:50] but bear again it, but bear grain. It
[1:13:52] may chance of wheat or some other grain.
[1:13:55] But God giveth it a body as it hath
[1:13:58] pleased him. That mean whatever body it
[1:14:01] is, it's going to be in his hands. We
[1:14:02] don't know. to every seed his own body.
[1:14:06] All flesh is not the same flesh, but
[1:14:07] there is one kind of flesh of men,
[1:14:09] another flesh of beasts, another of
[1:14:10] fishes, another of birds. There are also
[1:14:12] celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial.
[1:14:14] But the glory of the celestial is one
[1:14:16] and the glory of this the terrestrial is
[1:14:18] another. So Paul said when he was
[1:14:20] speaking about that man, I knew a man
[1:14:22] about 14 years ago or something who um
[1:14:26] ascended into heaven uh the third
[1:14:28] heaven. Whether he was in this body or
[1:14:30] without the body, I don't know. Only God
[1:14:32] knows. He repeated that
[1:14:35] Yeah, I can't tell. So, the thing is um
[1:14:40] none of us are able to tell you exactly
[1:14:43] what theophony is. We don't even know
[1:14:45] what earthly glorified is, what it looks
[1:14:48] like. We only know what we've been told.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; Right. So, he immediately identifies
[1:14:55] that there will be a contention about
[1:14:57] bodies. Some men will say, "How are the
[1:15:00] dead raised up and with what body?" In
[1:15:02] other words, from the first age, he told
[1:15:05] us there's going to be a contention
[1:15:06] about bodies.
[1:15:09] And we know this because he was a
[1:15:10] Pharisee. And remember the Pharisees had
[1:15:13] a question. Lord, there's this man who's
[1:15:15] got seven or six brothers or seven
[1:15:17] brothers. He marries a wife and uh you
[1:15:19] know he dies and then the next brother
[1:15:21] takes the lever law. In the in the end,
[1:15:23] whose wife is she?
[1:15:26] That's the question. These are the kind
[1:15:28] of questions that come up because of the
[1:15:30] contention of bodies.
[1:15:33] So
[1:15:35] he admitted that there is going to be uh
[1:15:39] limited knowledge says that celestial
[1:15:41] bodies are different to earthly bodies.
[1:15:42] He says but we believe he says there are
[1:15:45] celestial bodies that are terrestrial
[1:15:47] that celestial is heavenly terrestrial
[1:15:48] is earthly. The the heavenly has a glory
[1:15:51] the earthly has a glory but they are
[1:15:53] different in glories.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Yes
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; that's all we know. They are different
[1:15:57] in in in material. They are different in
[1:16:00] potentials. They are different in
[1:16:01] character. Celestial bodies and earthly
[1:16:04] bodies are totally different. Yes.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Right. There are many other things he
[1:16:09] says and references to theophanes he
[1:16:12] makes without even using the word
[1:16:14] theophanes because at that time Paul
[1:16:16] didn't use the word theophony you know.
[1:16:19] So it brings us to the conundrum we
[1:16:21] face.
[1:16:23] So, as per usual, the confusion we have
[1:16:26] is that God sent us a prophet who was
[1:16:30] meant to say things in a way that we
[1:16:31] might believe by faith to point us in
[1:16:34] the right direction to push us to dig
[1:16:36] deeper but not necessarily to explain
[1:16:39] everything
[1:16:41] and not even well.
[1:16:43] What am I saying? Brother Brandon never
[1:16:45] explained anything. Well, who is meant
[1:16:47] to say things to make us look at
[1:16:49] something, point us in that direction,
[1:16:51] dig deeper, find out more. Right?
[1:16:55] So, the prophet uses the word theophony
[1:16:58] all over the place. And sometimes he
[1:17:01] understood it. He used it in the way he
[1:17:04] understood it in that time. He used
[1:17:06] theophony the way he understood it in
[1:17:09] 1950, 1960. Are you with me? So also
[1:17:13] remember, brother Brandham is part of
[1:17:16] the seventh seal.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; That's what a lot of people don't know
[1:17:21] today. They don't get it. They don't
[1:17:23] understand what the seventh seal is.
[1:17:25] He's a part of it. He's a part of the
[1:17:27] veil that people are not going to be
[1:17:29] able to see through.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because of the of who God chose.
[1:17:34] God chose him as a person. God chose him
[1:17:37] because of the way he speaks.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. God chose him because of his
[1:17:41] education. God chose him because of
[1:17:44] where he was born, in what time he was
[1:17:46] born. He is part of the seal.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; That means God chose him because he was
[1:17:53] going to say some things that's going to
[1:17:55] look absolutely crazy.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; And God wanted it that way.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; His humanity, his speech, his actions
[1:18:04] are meant to be criticized. They are
[1:18:06] meant to be judged. They are meant to be
[1:18:08] diminished in the eyes of many people.
[1:18:11] His words are meant to be
[1:18:13] mischaracterized, misunderstood,
[1:18:15] misconstrued so that the word can only
[1:18:18] be believed by divine revelation and not
[1:18:22] because the prophet of God explained it
[1:18:25] to make perfect sense.
[1:18:28] That means we can use what he said to
[1:18:32] preach subjects, to teach concepts, but
[1:18:35] our knowledge is limited
[1:18:38] by how much God reveals to us in the
[1:18:40] time that we are growing. Which means
[1:18:42] I'm going to teach a subject in 2001 and
[1:18:45] that's as much as I know. Then 2010, I'm
[1:18:47] going to preach the same subject and I'm
[1:18:49] going to know more. And in 2025, I'm
[1:18:50] going to preach the same subject and
[1:18:52] then I know more. Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; That being said, when we talk about
[1:18:58] heaven and theophony, we are way out of
[1:19:00] our depth. I don't believe with what we
[1:19:03] have even in the message and in the
[1:19:05] Bible that we will ever know exactly how
[1:19:08] things are in heaven or the offening.
[1:19:11] And whoever claims to know it is a fool.
[1:19:15] Let's read the quotes. So, the the
[1:19:17] quotes that are in question, right? I
[1:19:19] want I want you to read it with fresh
[1:19:21] eyes and I want you to see what the
[1:19:24] person is saying. I'm going to give you
[1:19:27] um beforehand what the person is saying.
[1:19:29] Basically, brother man is speaking in
[1:19:31] 1965 in who is MelkiseDC. And it sounds
[1:19:35] like he's saying that Adam
[1:19:38] did not have a theophony. That Adam
[1:19:41] bypassed the theophony and came from
[1:19:43] attribute to flesh and we came like
[1:19:47] Adam.
[1:19:50] How many of you thought that before?
[1:19:54] No, you don't. But it looks like he says
[1:19:57] that. Let's read paragraph 67. Now we
[1:20:01] see the attribute sons of his spirit
[1:20:03] have not yet entered into the word form
[1:20:05] body. But a theophony this body is
[1:20:07] subject to the word earnest waiting for
[1:20:09] the earnest change of the body. Now the
[1:20:11] difference between him and you as a son
[1:20:13] he was the beginning that is Christ. At
[1:20:16] the beginning he was the word and morph
[1:20:18] body. He came in and lived in that in
[1:20:20] the person of MelkiseDC. Then later we
[1:20:22] ever heard we ever heard no more of
[1:20:24] MelkiseDC because he became Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ. MelkiseDC was the priest but he
[1:20:29] became Jesus Christ. Now you bypassed
[1:20:33] that. In other words, you bypassed the
[1:20:35] offering, right? Because in that form,
[1:20:39] what form? The word form. He knowed all
[1:20:41] things. And you have never been able to
[1:20:43] know that yet. Here it is. You come like
[1:20:48] Adam, like me. You became from the
[1:20:52] attribute to the flesh to be tempted.
[1:20:56] That statement already looks like says
[1:20:59] Adam came from attribute to the flesh
[1:21:02] and bypass the offering.
[1:21:06] They're right. You're reading that.
[1:21:07] You're confused, right? But when this
[1:21:11] life is finished here and goes on, let's
[1:21:13] go to paragraph. Oh, okay. Let's read.
[1:21:15] If this earthly tabernacle be dissolved,
[1:21:16] we have one already waiting. That's
[1:21:18] where we go. That is the word. Then we
[1:21:20] can look back and see what we've done.
[1:21:21] Now we don't understand it. We have
[1:21:23] never become the word. So he's saying we
[1:21:25] were never the word. We were the
[1:21:27] attribute. We didn't go from attribute
[1:21:28] to word to flesh. We went straight from
[1:21:31] attribute to flesh. Right? That proves
[1:21:34] the predestination of God up par 69. But
[1:21:37] and Luke clearly makes it clear. You
[1:21:39] will never be the word unless you was a
[1:21:40] thought at the beginning. So you could
[1:21:42] never be aophony unless you were an
[1:21:44] attribute.
[1:21:46] That proves the predestination of God.
[1:21:48] See, you can't be the word unless you
[1:21:50] were a thought. You had to be in the
[1:21:52] thinking first. But you see, in order to
[1:21:54] stand temptation, you had to bypass the
[1:21:56] theophony. Because he's saying if you
[1:21:59] had the theophony, you would So the
[1:22:01] concept is if you came into the fullness
[1:22:03] of theophony, you would easily be able
[1:22:06] to bypass temptation.
[1:22:08] That's the concept he's speaking of. But
[1:22:11] you see, in order to stand temptation,
[1:22:13] you had to bypass the theophony. You had
[1:22:14] to come down here in flesh to be
[1:22:15] tempted. Let's go to paragraph 78. This
[1:22:18] is the second place where he mentions
[1:22:20] it. And it sounds like those two. Then
[1:22:22] when a man is born again from heaven, he
[1:22:24] becomes a spirit baby in Christ. And
[1:22:26] when this robel flesh is dropped, there
[1:22:28] is a natural body, theophony, a body not
[1:22:30] made with hands, neither born of a woman
[1:22:32] that we go to. Then that body returns
[1:22:35] back and picks up the glorified body. If
[1:22:37] you only know the contentions on that
[1:22:39] one, that's the reason Jesus went to
[1:22:42] hell when he died and preached to the
[1:22:43] souls that were in prison. Turn back
[1:22:45] into that theophony. Oh, marvelous.
[1:22:47] Thank God. Okay, here it is. Pro 79 2
[1:22:50] Corinthians 5:1. If this earthly body be
[1:22:53] dissolved, he's reciting the same
[1:22:54] scripture. This earthly tabernacle, we
[1:22:56] have another one. See, we have bypassed
[1:22:58] that to come straight from God. The
[1:23:01] attribute to be flesh, to be tempted and
[1:23:04] tested by sin like Adam did.
[1:23:09] By then, testing of his word is over.
[1:23:11] Then we are taken up to this body that
[1:23:13] was prepared for us before the
[1:23:14] foundation of the world. It is the word
[1:23:16] that we skipped to come right down and
[1:23:18] down here to be tempted and tested.
[1:23:20] Okay?
[1:23:22] You all agree that quote is confusing.
[1:23:26] The person has a point to ask this
[1:23:28] question. But then the question is what
[1:23:31] do we do with this? The understanding
[1:23:34] that Adam was not created in theophony
[1:23:37] is only from these two quotes. There's
[1:23:40] nowhere else in the message that you're
[1:23:43] going to get this right. So these there
[1:23:46] are numerous references and you know
[1:23:48] them right through the message that say
[1:23:51] Adam was first created in a celestial
[1:23:55] form in Genesis 1:26-27
[1:23:58] and then later formed in flesh in
[1:24:00] Genesis 2:7. You all know that. Every
[1:24:03] message believer knows that that in fact
[1:24:06] Genesis 1:26 27 and Genesis 2:7 is the
[1:24:10] building block of the prophet's ministry
[1:24:12] on man. His
[1:24:15] entire message is based on that. You've
[1:24:18] only got these two quotes in whose is.
[1:24:22] So the most recent I've heard this
[1:24:26] belief that Adam bypassed his theophony
[1:24:28] is that because the prophet said in this
[1:24:31] mazec after the seals. So I've heard
[1:24:34] people telling me that because he says
[1:24:37] this after the seals most likely he
[1:24:40] corrected everything he said before. So,
[1:24:42] we got to like discard everything he
[1:24:44] said before and just take this because
[1:24:48] he preached it after the seals. Now, I'm
[1:24:51] not sure where this originated. I
[1:24:53] certainly don't see it that way. I
[1:24:56] certainly do not fault anyone who
[1:24:58] chooses to see it that way because if
[1:25:01] they read and they don't know and they
[1:25:03] haven't studied the the entire depth of
[1:25:05] it and this is the way they are seeing
[1:25:07] it, well, I can't fault them for that.
[1:25:10] As long as the way they see it leads
[1:25:13] them to the opening of the seventh seal,
[1:25:15] the restoration of all that Adam lost,
[1:25:17] the open book in the hands of the bride,
[1:25:19] I stand with my brothers who see it that
[1:25:22] way. But I do not see it that way.
[1:25:25] To answer the question based on this
[1:25:28] quote, my thoughts are that this quote
[1:25:31] is being misread.
[1:25:34] It is the prophet's manner of speaking
[1:25:37] that causes the divide. when I read this
[1:25:40] because my anchor is in Genesis is is in
[1:25:44] his teaching on Genesis 126:27 and
[1:25:47] Genesis 2:7 that's my anchor so if
[1:25:51] that's my anchor when I encounter this
[1:25:53] quote what am I going to see
[1:25:58] right so when I read this and I see this
[1:26:02] in the first quote we come like Adam
[1:26:05] could only mean we came like Adam in
[1:26:08] Adam's condition after
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; right Adam had to do something to be
[1:26:16] tempted.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; After Adam lost his theophony
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; in the second quote he meant. So in
[1:26:26] other words we came like Adam meaning we
[1:26:29] came in this in the condition of Adam
[1:26:32] when he was tempted
[1:26:35] after he had lost his theophony. That's
[1:26:38] what I'm seeing. Why am I seeing that?
[1:26:40] Because I see everything else that he
[1:26:41] breached. Right? So, I'm going to show
[1:26:45] you. Right? So, nowhere in the message
[1:26:47] to my knowledge will you ever find him
[1:26:49] say anywhere else that Adam bypass this
[1:26:51] theophony
[1:26:53] in in fact to do that would make him not
[1:26:57] Adam.
[1:27:01] This is the problem. Do you know what an
[1:27:03] Adam is?
[1:27:06] Do you know why there is a second Adam?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; Question and answers in Hebrews part
[1:27:12] three. I'm going to show you some of
[1:27:13] them. God in the beginning when he
[1:27:15] knowed man and woman was made one, not
[1:27:17] two. They were made one. They were
[1:27:19] separated. One put in flesh, one in a
[1:27:22] theophony. He knew that. So in order to
[1:27:25] prove that to you, when God made the
[1:27:27] woman, he never took some dust. So do
[1:27:29] you see there's a direct quote where he
[1:27:31] said they were theophony. And when God
[1:27:34] took out the man to make him flesh, one
[1:27:36] part of him was still in theophony.
[1:27:41] Right? Let's go to question and answers.
[1:27:44] Uh paragraph 8:29.
[1:27:46] And Adam was lonesome. God took to show
[1:27:49] that could not be separated. Now, I'm
[1:27:51] going to get back into that some just a
[1:27:53] second. Look, he never went and got dirt
[1:27:55] and made Eve, but he made from the
[1:27:57] original dirt, Adam. He took a rib from
[1:27:59] his side and made him a helpmate. That
[1:28:01] was Eve. She was made for the man. Part
[1:28:03] of the man. She was part of him in the
[1:28:06] beginning in the creation in the
[1:28:07] theophony. She was part of him down here
[1:28:08] in this creation. She could not. So she
[1:28:11] was part of him in the beginning in the
[1:28:13] creation in the theophony.
[1:28:18] Right?
[1:28:20] That means you have to if you're stating
[1:28:22] this in this misuse, you have to take
[1:28:25] this prophet back to his own words here
[1:28:28] and tell him you were wrong there
[1:28:31] because here you are saying Adam
[1:28:33] bypassed his theophony and actually he's
[1:28:36] not saying that.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; He's saying you bypassed your theophony
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; but you came to be tempted like Adam.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; that's what he's saying.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. you are doing. In other words,
[1:28:49] those who are doing that are doing
[1:28:51] everything they criticize other people
[1:28:52] for.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; You are interpreting it the way for a
[1:28:57] particular reason. Right? So she was,
[1:29:00] she says she was part of him down here
[1:29:02] in this creation. She could not be
[1:29:03] divided in another creation. In other
[1:29:05] words, she was part of him in theophony.
[1:29:07] If he made him in flesh, she could not
[1:29:08] be separated from him. She had to be
[1:29:10] with him in flesh. That's the point
[1:29:13] there. That's exactly why Christ and God
[1:29:15] had to be the very same person. And if
[1:29:17] you and this is what I love about this
[1:29:19] quote in the in the end here, he says
[1:29:21] how Christ is gone back and Christ is
[1:29:23] theophony now the way he was then.
[1:29:27] See there are people who literally
[1:29:29] believe Christ is in heaven in the body
[1:29:32] with nail scars and flesh. The quotes of
[1:29:34] brother Baron says he's in theophony
[1:29:36] now.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; The way he's he's his always existence
[1:29:40] has been theophony. that theophony that
[1:29:43] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:29:45] He died and and and ascended and went
[1:29:47] back to being theophony
[1:29:50] question and answer in Hebrews part 3
[1:29:52] 8:26.
[1:29:54] Now this is Adam walking through the
[1:29:56] garden of Eden before he's formed in
[1:29:59] flesh and as he walked through the
[1:30:01] garden of Eden first as a theophony
[1:30:05] like the Holy Spirit is in here now
[1:30:07] walking in here it he's saying he's
[1:30:09] telling us first Adam's theophony led
[1:30:12] the animal life
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; it controlled everything but it couldn't
[1:30:16] till the soil so God put him in flesh so
[1:30:20] that he could till the soil and give him
[1:30:22] five senses but you have a direct quote
[1:30:24] telling us he was in theophony.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Adam did not bypass theophony. Adam
[1:30:31] first walked the in one place he says
[1:30:33] Adam's theophony he couldn't contact the
[1:30:35] animals. He was like a like his toes as
[1:30:38] if he was planted in the ground
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; to till the soil fix up the vineyards
[1:30:44] and so forth. Oh this beautiful picture
[1:30:46] look for what he's first made. He was
[1:30:48] made two he was made two people
[1:30:50] together. He was made both male and
[1:30:53] female. Man was the Bible said God made
[1:30:55] man both male and female created him.
[1:30:59] Notice when man was separated from the
[1:31:01] theophony and put in flesh, he wasn't
[1:31:03] just altogether there.
[1:31:05] He wasn't altogether there in the flesh.
[1:31:08] Part of his being was still a theophony.
[1:31:11] So it didn't look right.
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. This is a few quotes of many. Are
[1:31:20] you with me? Amen.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; So of course the problem you face when
[1:31:24] you say that Adam was not theophony
[1:31:26] first is that you wipe out the most
[1:31:29] amazing story in question and answer on
[1:31:31] Genesis 1. There's really so much to
[1:31:34] teach on this but that would take
[1:31:36] another series. I just want to address
[1:31:38] the question and the reason for the
[1:31:39] question. So the real reason I think I'm
[1:31:42] giving the benefit of the doubt to my
[1:31:44] brothers who believe this right who why
[1:31:48] would they want to believe that Adam
[1:31:50] bypassed his theophony
[1:31:53] right and I think it's because the
[1:31:56] belief is that if you have a theophony
[1:31:58] you cannot sin
[1:32:00] that's what I think that's where I think
[1:32:02] it comes from and and yet Adam sinned
[1:32:08] so therefore now Now you got to get to
[1:32:10] why did Adam sin? How could he have
[1:32:12] sinned if he had a theophony? Because
[1:32:14] the whole point is it's being put to you
[1:32:16] like your adoption is your theophony.
[1:32:19] And when you get your theophony, you
[1:32:21] will never you'll be above sin.
[1:32:24] Right? And therefore he could not have
[1:32:26] had a theophony. That's what so in my
[1:32:27] humble opinion that is a very misguided
[1:32:31] belief that if you have a theophony you
[1:32:34] cannot sin.
[1:32:35] I have a theophony right now in heaven.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Right? Because the prophet said,
[1:32:44] "Sin began
[1:32:47] in heaven."
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Quote, "Sin did not begin in Eden. Sin
[1:32:54] did not begin on earth." That means sin
[1:32:56] began in angels who are in a celestial
[1:33:00] body. So to say that if you have
[1:33:03] theophony you cannot sin, you have to
[1:33:05] have an understanding of what you're
[1:33:07] saying.
[1:33:08] Lucifer and his angels sinned in
[1:33:11] celestial form. They were not in fleshly
[1:33:15] body form. They sinned while they were
[1:33:17] made perfect angels.
[1:33:22] So also attaining theophony
[1:33:25] many ministers I've heard in the last
[1:33:27] few maybe two decades or so where it's
[1:33:30] really been punched in that that
[1:33:33] adoption you're waiting for your
[1:33:35] adoption and your full adoption is when
[1:33:37] you possess the full power of your
[1:33:39] theophony and and they get this from
[1:33:41] Matthew 17 where Christ was on the mount
[1:33:44] transfiguration with with uh uh um
[1:33:47] Peter, James and John and they saw
[1:33:49] Christ transfigured in the proph Prophet
[1:33:51] said they were the three witnesses of
[1:33:53] his adoption. So if he was clothed in
[1:33:55] his theophony then uh that is his
[1:33:59] adoption transfiguration. But then
[1:34:02] Christ left the mountain went back to
[1:34:04] flesh and died.
[1:34:09] So if you have your theophony you won't
[1:34:11] die.
[1:34:15] So this is also slightly off the mark
[1:34:18] because adoption is not that adoption is
[1:34:23] the placing of sons. You know those
[1:34:26] quotes are throughout the message.
[1:34:27] Adoption is the placing of sons. In
[1:34:29] other words, a son being put into a
[1:34:31] position to fulfill his purpose. That's
[1:34:33] adoption.
[1:34:35] You don't have to be a perfect
[1:34:37] individual to reach your stage of
[1:34:38] adoption. You need to be ready to do
[1:34:40] what you've been called to. That's your
[1:34:42] adoption,
[1:34:44] right? So the transfiguration of Christ
[1:34:48] was used to show adoption of Christ for
[1:34:50] the purpose of Calvary to Peter, James,
[1:34:53] and John. That doesn't mean that every
[1:34:55] son of God only achieves adoption at the
[1:34:58] transfiguration.
[1:35:01] Saints, what is the point of when the
[1:35:03] rapture finally is fulfilled, takes
[1:35:05] place, you and I are transfigured, then
[1:35:08] what's our purpose?
[1:35:10] What's our adopted purpose? I mean,
[1:35:13] we're going to be transfigured and taken
[1:35:14] to heaven, and we got no more purpose
[1:35:16] now on earth.
[1:35:18] We have a purpose on earth which we have
[1:35:20] been adopted for. We are predestinated
[1:35:22] unto that adoption.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; What was Abraham's adopted position? To
[1:35:29] produce Isaac. He was predestinated to
[1:35:32] that.
[1:35:35] See that? So, to me, it's it's those two
[1:35:38] things. the the transfiguration of
[1:35:40] Christ and the thought that if you have
[1:35:42] a theophony, you cannot sin.
[1:35:45] And that is totally debunked by two
[1:35:47] things. The second thing we're going to
[1:35:49] talk about now, Jesus was transfigured
[1:35:52] and still was rejected and died on
[1:35:54] Calvary. You cannot have true purpose in
[1:35:56] God unless you are connected with your
[1:35:59] theophony. That means what is true is
[1:36:02] when you receive your connection to your
[1:36:04] theophony, you are coming to your
[1:36:07] adoption. You are coming to realize your
[1:36:10] position. What does that mean? When I'm
[1:36:13] connected to my theophony by the word
[1:36:15] for my day, what does that mean?
[1:36:18] Suddenly, I see my purpose beyond my own
[1:36:21] will.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; And I start walking by God's will.
[1:36:25] That's my adoption. That's when I become
[1:36:28] a child of God and not a child of the
[1:36:30] world. That's when I choose to do what
[1:36:32] God wants me to do and not what the
[1:36:34] world says I must do. Right? That's your
[1:36:37] adoption. That puts you to the purpose
[1:36:39] for your day. Okay. The last thought on
[1:36:42] this, well, not really the last thought,
[1:36:45] the last important thought. I spoke
[1:36:47] about the name Adam. Adam is a peculiar
[1:36:51] designation.
[1:36:53] It is the and and the only Christ
[1:36:58] is the only other person in the Bible
[1:37:01] who is called Adam.
[1:37:04] The second Adam to be exact. Why is he
[1:37:08] called? Why is Christ called an Adam?
[1:37:10] Why is he not called a Moses? Why is he
[1:37:12] not called an Elijah? Why is he not
[1:37:14] called Samuel? Why is he called an Adam?
[1:37:18] Because Adam was Genesis 1:26.
[1:37:21] Oh yeah.
[1:37:23] having the purpose of bringing forth
[1:37:26] many sons unto God.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; That is an Adam. If you talk about a
[1:37:31] third pole manifestation, okay,
[1:37:34] let's you go back to all the quotes.
[1:37:37] Adam could speak things into existence.
[1:37:39] Talk about a third pole. Adam could name
[1:37:42] things. He had the power and dominion
[1:37:43] over all the elements. If adoption is
[1:37:46] that, how could he not have had it?
[1:37:52] Right.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the brief message. You know
[1:37:55] this quote very well. Now when Adam
[1:37:58] sinned by heeding his wife's reasoning
[1:38:00] instead of holding to God's word that
[1:38:01] made that's what made Adam sin. His wife
[1:38:04] reasoned with Satan and then produced
[1:38:06] the product to Adam. And Adam turned
[1:38:09] loose the word and sold out.
[1:38:13] He lost his inheritance. That's his
[1:38:15] theophony. When he lost his fellowship
[1:38:17] and right to life, sorry, his
[1:38:19] inheritance of the earth, his
[1:38:20] fellowship, the theophony, his right to
[1:38:22] life, the right to the tree of life,
[1:38:24] right? When he lost his life, he also
[1:38:26] lost his inheritance because he complete
[1:38:28] listen, he had complete supreme control
[1:38:32] of the earth. He was God of the earth.
[1:38:35] If ever there was a third pull,
[1:38:39] if ever there, you remember speaking to
[1:38:41] the Killable, the Hornets,
[1:38:43] the the the Colorado storm,
[1:38:46] Hatty, right, discerning, all of that
[1:38:48] was set was showed to us as being the
[1:38:50] third book. Tell me how Adam failed to
[1:38:53] meet this requirement and actually
[1:38:55] surpass that requirement.
[1:38:59] He listen he could his son gods the god
[1:39:04] of the universe everywhere but his son
[1:39:06] had this earth under his control. Adam
[1:39:08] could speak he could name he could say
[1:39:11] he could stop nature he could do
[1:39:13] anything he wanted to and Christ is
[1:39:15] called a second Adam because Christ had
[1:39:17] exactly the same thing.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; He could not do that. Adam could not do
[1:39:22] that without theophony.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. But he said Adam turned loose the
[1:39:30] word.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; What does that mean?
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; So the last point of this is Adam's sin.
[1:39:37] What is Adam's sin? This is a complex
[1:39:40] one to get around because of the
[1:39:42] different context of English
[1:39:45] words the prophet uses. Now the Bible
[1:39:47] said Adam did not transgress. He said
[1:39:50] his wife was in the transgression. The
[1:39:52] prophet said Eve only did the act but
[1:39:54] Adam sinned.
[1:39:57] The Bible says Adam did not transgress.
[1:40:00] Brother man says Eve did the act but
[1:40:02] Adam sinned.
[1:40:05] So to understand that who was actually
[1:40:08] tempted was the woman. Right? And what
[1:40:12] did Adam do that was wrong?
[1:40:16] So it would take too long to read all
[1:40:18] the quotes. I'm going to tell you so
[1:40:19] that you can go search it for yourself.
[1:40:22] Adam
[1:40:23] exercised his free will
[1:40:27] to forfeit his theophony
[1:40:30] for his wife's sake.
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; That is sin.
[1:40:38] What is sin? You have a purpose God has
[1:40:41] given you and you are exercising your
[1:40:43] free will to go against God's purpose.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; That's what Lucifer did.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah.
[1:40:53] Adam chose by free will. So I was having
[1:40:55] this conversation with my sons uh some
[1:40:58] weeks ago and one of them said to me,
[1:41:00] "You mean so we have our glorified
[1:41:02] bodies in the millennium and we'll be
[1:41:04] we'll have our theophony. Will we still
[1:41:06] have free will?" I said, "Yes." He said,
[1:41:09] "So you mean we could choose to not
[1:41:11] follow God in the millennium?" I said,
[1:41:12] "Yeah, you can, but you won't
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; because you've already made the choice
[1:41:18] here."
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:41:20] and you have fulfilled it and you've
[1:41:21] come to the full to the fullness of the
[1:41:23] word. So that's where we go to. Why was
[1:41:26] Adam able to forfeit his theophony?
[1:41:30] He hadn't come to the fullness.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Christ was the fullness.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; And came to flesh. Adam was still
[1:41:38] growing.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; So he was able to make a free You have
[1:41:43] to start with free will.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Because that's the place. So when you
[1:41:47] choose not to do God's will, that is
[1:41:50] sin. Lucifer sinned in heaven by
[1:41:53] forsaking his God-given purpose and
[1:41:56] desiring a different purpose. He didn't
[1:41:58] do anything immoral
[1:42:02] like earthly immorality. He didn't do
[1:42:04] anything wrong like killing someone or
[1:42:08] shooting someone or im sexual immorality
[1:42:11] or stealing. He didn't do anything. He
[1:42:13] desired a different purpose to what God
[1:42:16] had given him and he sinned.
[1:42:20] Sin began in heaven. Now I want to read
[1:42:23] this quote to you. All right. This our
[1:42:25] second last quote I think.
[1:42:28] Okay.
[1:42:30] Um harvest time
[1:42:33] part of 286. Are you ready for this? How
[1:42:36] many of you believe Christ fell?
[1:42:40] Hm. Christ fell.
[1:42:44] Like he did the second Adam. Adam after
[1:42:46] Adam fell, he began to raise the second
[1:42:48] Adam and the second Adam fell.
[1:42:52] Then it was taken up. The first Adam
[1:42:54] fell in his sin and stayed there. The
[1:42:56] second Adam fell to redeem a man from
[1:42:58] sin and was taken up. So here's one for
[1:43:01] my friends who think they only say what
[1:43:03] the prophet says. Poor guys. Here you
[1:43:06] are called on to explain what he is
[1:43:09] literally saying.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Cuz if you only say second Adam fell,
[1:43:14] what do you mean that Christ fell?
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. He will just say what he
[1:43:19] says.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; You just say what he says and you're
[1:43:22] going to cause trouble.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:23] &gt;&gt; Because when I said Christ fell, I saw
[1:43:26] the look on all your faces. What are you
[1:43:28] talking about? The second But you have a
[1:43:31] quote where he says the second Adam
[1:43:33] fell. How did the second Adam fall, my
[1:43:35] brother? Does he mean the second Adam
[1:43:37] Christ sinned?
[1:43:40] This is an easy one. Of course, you'll
[1:43:43] come up with some bright message
[1:43:44] answers. No, he's he took sin upon
[1:43:46] himself.
[1:43:48] You know, Christ made a free will
[1:43:52] decision to relinquish his theophony so
[1:43:55] he could die on Calvary.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. for the sake of his bride. He did
[1:44:01] exactly what Adam did.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; You know that.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; See, but you have to explain what
[1:44:10] brother says, which means you're going
[1:44:12] to end up saying what he did not say.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Of course, I know the answer. It to me,
[1:44:20] it's just the hypocrisy that is rank.
[1:44:24] The fall of both Adams was a free will
[1:44:26] choice to save the bride. Except one
[1:44:30] lost his theophony
[1:44:32] and the second went back to his
[1:44:34] theophony.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; After he was resurrected.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Here's in in conclusion
[1:44:43] something that really blew it open for
[1:44:45] me many years ago when I was a young
[1:44:48] minister and I will say this. I believe
[1:44:50] that Adam's theophony was growing to
[1:44:54] maturity. I didn't know that theophanies
[1:44:56] grow
[1:44:58] until the same prophet who speaks so
[1:45:01] weirdly said it.
[1:45:03] I didn't know because and that's the
[1:45:05] real problem because when you think
[1:45:07] theophony you think this complete
[1:45:09] powerful all powerful being which is
[1:45:12] there it's waiting for you. No, the
[1:45:14] prophet says it grows.
[1:45:17] He was so Christ was fully the word
[1:45:20] which mean he had a theophony that was
[1:45:22] fully grown if you could put it that
[1:45:24] way.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Right. In fact, it it didn't even grow.
[1:45:27] His theophony came straight from the
[1:45:28] fountain of life to
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; King Theophony.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Right. But with Adam, he came from
[1:45:34] attribute to theophony and he had to
[1:45:36] grow.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; He had to learn. Right. Let's read
[1:45:41] question and answer. Where do I get it
[1:45:42] from? Page 1156
[1:45:44] 58. This is a dying spirit in a dying
[1:45:47] body. But now you can't be in two bodies
[1:45:48] at one time. But there can be two
[1:45:50] natures in you at one time. Now the
[1:45:52] nature of the spirit of the Lord when
[1:45:53] you're born again, you're born a
[1:45:54] physical like the baby was. But what's
[1:45:56] happened is spiritual birth has come to
[1:45:58] you. And while the spiritual bird is
[1:45:59] growing into your heart of God, there's
[1:46:01] a physical or celestial body growing to
[1:46:04] receive the spirit.
[1:46:07] He says your celestial body is growing
[1:46:10] in proportion to how the new birth is
[1:46:12] growing in you on earth. So as the word
[1:46:15] grows in you here, theophony grows in
[1:46:18] heaven. So I didn't I explained this to
[1:46:19] you. I said I don't believe that
[1:46:20] theophony is growing like in height and
[1:46:23] stature.
[1:46:25] It's growing in potential.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; Right. And I'm going to explain this. He
[1:46:29] says when the spirit leaves his body and
[1:46:31] goes out into that body, there's a body
[1:46:33] waiting for you. So wherever you died in
[1:46:36] the in the in in the church ages, when
[1:46:39] you died, you went no longer into the
[1:46:41] fifth. You went into the sixth
[1:46:42] dimension. You went into a theophony
[1:46:45] body waiting for you. Right?
[1:46:49] When I read this
[1:46:51] many years ago, it opened up so much to
[1:46:54] me. When I was young, in my heart, I
[1:46:57] questioned because of how it was
[1:46:58] preached back then. If theophony was
[1:47:01] this ultimate achievement of perfection,
[1:47:03] how could Luther and Wesley and all the
[1:47:05] dead saints be in theophony while they
[1:47:08] had not reached perfection?
[1:47:12] Right. Luther was a trinitarian. How
[1:47:15] could he go into theophony? He was a he
[1:47:18] was a he drank beer and smoked a pipe.
[1:47:20] He was a regular German. How could he go
[1:47:23] into theophony? Those were the questions
[1:47:25] I had as a youth. Why did all the saints
[1:47:28] that the prophet saw beyond the curtain
[1:47:30] of time in their theophony say they
[1:47:33] couldn't see Jesus yet?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; It bugged me.
[1:47:37] It occurred to me because of this quote
[1:47:40] that it was possible that a theophony or
[1:47:42] a celestial body grew in potential based
[1:47:46] on the word that you came to in your
[1:47:48] day. He said as a spiritual grow birth
[1:47:52] grows in you, your physical celestial
[1:47:54] body grows obviously in the sixth
[1:47:55] dimension waiting for your spirit to
[1:47:57] inhabit. So if you die having believed a
[1:48:01] portion of the true word for your day,
[1:48:03] you enter into your theophony which has
[1:48:05] the potential of the word you received
[1:48:07] and believed.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; It occurred to me that this was the
[1:48:10] reason why they were not complete.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; And without us they cannot be made
[1:48:17] perfect.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; They are waiting for us to come into the
[1:48:20] marriage of the lamb and the bride. We
[1:48:23] can only Why are we called the bride?
[1:48:25] Because we come to the fullness of the
[1:48:27] word. We can only marry the fullness of
[1:48:29] the word if we've come to the fullness
[1:48:31] of the word ourselves and they are
[1:48:33] waiting for that perfection. Amen. They
[1:48:35] are waiting for us to complete the race.
[1:48:38] So which will if we then achieve that we
[1:48:41] will make the choice never to forsake
[1:48:45] our purpose and manifest it in the
[1:48:47] millennium someday.
[1:48:49] That's what we are here for. We are here
[1:48:52] to make the choice. Eve could not
[1:48:55] because Eve was also growing. We are
[1:48:58] come to the fullness. He says the church
[1:49:00] made the mistake at na but not this
[1:49:03] bride.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he brings us the open book.
[1:49:07] We come to we receive the full word
[1:49:09] within us. We have the answer to the
[1:49:11] devil's question. We will not exercise
[1:49:13] our free will against God's will. Look
[1:49:16] at what the test was in Gethsemane.
[1:49:19] What was it about? Will.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Father, if it be thy will, let this cup
[1:49:24] pass. Nevertheless, not my will, but thy
[1:49:26] will be done. Victory.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him, saints.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; So, this is the reason why I I believe
[1:49:35] you can read who's MelkiseDC and you
[1:49:37] understand what happened with Adam was
[1:49:39] he forfeited his theophony and he became
[1:49:43] flesh,
[1:49:45] plain flesh, without theophony and was
[1:49:48] tempted. From there on, he was tempted
[1:49:50] and tested by sin for the rest of his
[1:49:52] life. But he had to make the free will
[1:49:55] choice to forfeit his theophony.
[1:49:58] Amen. The reason he was called Adam was
[1:50:01] because he had a theophony.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; The created man of Genesis 1:26 was
[1:50:06] called Adam.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; Genesis 5:1. In the day that he created
[1:50:10] him, male and female made he him. Male
[1:50:13] and female created he them, and called
[1:50:14] their name Adam. Their designation was
[1:50:17] to bring forth many sons of God. All
[1:50:20] other sons of God failed. And there come
[1:50:22] a second Adam who comes from theophony
[1:50:25] to flesh to bring forth many sons like
[1:50:27] unto himself.
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Question four. Last question and
[1:50:33] we can close. Are we and our wives in
[1:50:36] theophony? One in theophony. Does that
[1:50:40] mean we share one theophony body? In
[1:50:42] fact, the brother asked me this
[1:50:43] question. asked me do you and your wife
[1:50:45] have one theophony
[1:50:48] so this last question obviously is
[1:50:50] related to the last one again because I
[1:50:53] don't know everything what I say is
[1:50:55] subject to correction I believe that
[1:50:58] there's a lot to this but I will uh I'll
[1:51:01] start this way the process is that we
[1:51:05] should have come by the word first and
[1:51:08] we should have been in my wife and I
[1:51:10] should have been in theophony first and
[1:51:13] And then our body's spoken into
[1:51:15] existence and perfectly into that. Are
[1:51:18] we together? That's the process. It
[1:51:20] should have happened. But now we bypass
[1:51:24] the offen. The seed comes from eternity
[1:51:27] to find bodies of flesh. Those bodies of
[1:51:30] flesh are struggling with self-will.
[1:51:33] Right? So each I believe that each man
[1:51:36] and each woman has their own celestial
[1:51:39] body.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Right. When sin came in, it changed the
[1:51:44] process and we became flesh first born
[1:51:47] of a woman not having. So my wife and I
[1:51:50] are born into this world and we don't
[1:51:52] have the same purposes. She's born into
[1:51:54] a family that has its own purpose. My
[1:51:56] family has its own purpose. They have
[1:51:58] their own idea of life. We have our own
[1:52:00] idea of life. We come into we meet one
[1:52:02] another. We fall in love. We don't even
[1:52:04] know what that means. What it actually
[1:52:06] means is we realize we can have one
[1:52:08] purpose together.
[1:52:10] That's what it means. We can share one
[1:52:12] purpose. We have to forfeit our free
[1:52:14] will for one another for the same
[1:52:16] purpose.
[1:52:18] &gt;&gt; That's what marriage actually is for
[1:52:20] some of you who don't know that.
[1:52:22] And that's what makes you one in
[1:52:24] theophony.
[1:52:26] The purpose because that's what
[1:52:28] theophony was for initially. It was
[1:52:32] about a purpose. Right? So our struggle
[1:52:35] with our wives and our husbands today is
[1:52:37] the uniting of purpose. We struggle to
[1:52:40] see
[1:52:42] eye to eye. If we don't accept that we
[1:52:45] share one earthly purpose, we struggle.
[1:52:49] Right? So if the wife you choose in life
[1:52:52] believes in the word as you do and you
[1:52:56] have one purpose, she like you will grow
[1:52:59] to be one in the
[1:53:01] right and yet for the translation you
[1:53:04] will have your own celestial form. Are
[1:53:06] you with me? What does it mean one in
[1:53:08] theophony? The same way you are one here
[1:53:10] in purpose. Theophony you are one in
[1:53:13] purpose.
[1:53:15] And that actually tells you for the
[1:53:17] millennium you'll be united glorified
[1:53:19] body which is flesh and theophony
[1:53:21] joined. There'll be no conflict of
[1:53:23] purpose.
[1:53:25] Are you with me? So that's what I think
[1:53:28] that means which leads us down a rabbit
[1:53:31] hole of many other questions.
[1:53:34] Right? And I'm just going to tell you
[1:53:36] what happens to those who were married
[1:53:38] and divorced.
[1:53:41] What happens to those whose wife died
[1:53:42] and took another?
[1:53:44] What happens to those who came from
[1:53:46] polygamous marriage which is the true
[1:53:48] wife on the other side?
[1:53:51] I'm so glad I don't have that problem.
[1:53:58] You could use the prophet's experience.
[1:54:00] You could say, "Well, he saw on the
[1:54:01] other side one wife on this arm, one
[1:54:04] wife on the other, both wives are in
[1:54:06] heaven." I don't know, saints. I cannot
[1:54:08] confirm any of those things. I
[1:54:12] way out of my depth. Right? You could
[1:54:15] use his experience to claim this and and
[1:54:17] some brothers will say, "Well, the wife
[1:54:19] you married first, she'll be your one in
[1:54:22] the offen. She's the one who refuses to
[1:54:25] believe the word here." What's going on?
[1:54:30] The other one from the polygamous number
[1:54:32] three is the one that actually loves the
[1:54:33] word. What's happening?
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:40] My advice to you is not concern yourself
[1:54:44] with another existence in the future
[1:54:47] while you're struggling with this
[1:54:49] present one.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Let's focus on this existence. Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Let's get this right and let God take up
[1:54:58] the take care of heaven in the future.
[1:55:01] &gt;&gt; I don't need to break my brain about
[1:55:03] which wife is going to be there with me.
[1:55:05] And I cannot tell you how I know I'm
[1:55:08] making light of it, but there's there
[1:55:10] are people who come from from those
[1:55:12] situations and it's going to be like,
[1:55:14] you know,
[1:55:15] like if I know which one it is, I'll
[1:55:17] give more preference to that one. You
[1:55:19] know,
[1:55:21] I'm way out of my debt, saints. I don't
[1:55:23] I don't know how to answer those
[1:55:25] questions. I don't know anything about
[1:55:27] that. That is all in God's hands. My
[1:55:29] point to you, live as close to the word
[1:55:31] as you can today. Stand for the truth.
[1:55:33] Do everything you can to please God's
[1:55:35] word and let him take care of the future
[1:55:37] and the rest. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[1:55:39] together.
