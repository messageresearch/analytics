[0:00] Amen. And amen.
[0:02] Amen. While you're standing,
[0:05] we're going to read in our Bibles or you
[0:08] can follow on the screen from
[0:10] 1 Peter
[0:13] 1:3-5.
[0:15] 1 Peter chapter 1:3-5.
[0:19] And the word of God reads like this.
[0:21] Blessed be the God and Father of our
[0:23] Lord Jesus Christ, which according to
[0:26] his abundant mercy, hath begotten us
[0:31] again unto a lively hope by the
[0:35] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[0:37] dead. Two,
[0:40] begotten us unto a lively hope from the
[0:45] dead. By the resurrection of Jesus
[0:47] Christ from the dead, we are begotten to
[0:49] verse four to an inheritance
[0:52] incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth
[0:55] not away, reserved in heaven for you,
[0:59] who
[1:01] are kept by the power of God through
[1:04] faith unto salvation, ready to be
[1:07] revealed in the last time. The Lord add
[1:09] a blessing to his word. You may be
[1:11] seated.
[1:14] Praise be to God.
[1:16] Greetings saints in the name of the Lord
[1:18] Jesus Christ. Certainly good to be with
[1:20] all of you this morning and to share the
[1:22] word of the Lord with you. Thankful to
[1:25] brother Liam for last week had some good
[1:28] reports about the services. So we
[1:31] appreciate the gifts of God in the
[1:32] church and u thankful to God for the
[1:35] ministries of our brothers and we
[1:37] appreciate all of you. And we had a good
[1:40] time with the saints in Newcastle as
[1:42] well. It was uh a good trip and uh we
[1:46] are thankful that there are uh saints
[1:48] standing up for the faith. Amen. In
[1:50] these last days, good to see brother
[1:51] Shadrach and his family back from the
[1:54] dead. Uh they were sick with the these
[1:57] these flu that were going around I think
[1:59] this this winter was terrible. It's just
[2:02] I got uh reports from all kinds of
[2:04] people just it wasn't just a flu. you
[2:07] were like flat on your back laid out and
[2:10] uh coughing and wheezing and not you
[2:12] know wondering whether you're going to
[2:14] wake up but we're thankful to God that
[2:16] we are restored. Amen.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; So uh and I know some of the little ones
[2:22] you know take a real impact with these
[2:25] uh with these um sicknesses.
[2:29] But anyway, we're really thankful to be
[2:31] back in the presence of the Lord. And
[2:33] once again, I'm, you know, I'm wanting
[2:36] to um move on in the series and get back
[2:39] to the name of God and and uh but there
[2:42] there seems to be a um
[2:45] uh a shift
[2:48] happening
[2:50] all over and there's like a real there's
[2:53] an excitement among some a lot of people
[2:56] in the message and then there's a
[2:58] there's a on the other hand there's just
[3:00] people falling away like terrible
[3:03] So, um, but we we press on. We we've got
[3:07] to do what God is calling us to do.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; We've got to speak the word. We've got
[3:11] to trust that the Lord does what is
[3:14] necessary for his people. Amen.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; So, uh, I I think I I hope I'm going to
[3:21] be speaking on the question and answers
[3:24] on the Holy Ghost. This going to be part
[3:25] three and, uh, hopefully this is going
[3:28] to be the last questions on it. But so
[3:31] not really a question from
[3:34] anybody, but we're going to get into
[3:36] that in a little while. Uh something we
[3:39] picked up many years ago. But so it has
[3:43] occurred to me since speaking on the
[3:45] Holy Ghost recently and uh
[3:47] sanctification
[3:49] and uh conversations that I've been
[3:51] having with people uh that have resulted
[3:54] since then. I've realized exactly how
[3:58] much religious indoctrination
[4:01] has weakened the true Christian
[4:03] experience.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; And there still remains a lot of
[4:06] confusion in people regarding the first
[4:09] and the simplest steps toward salvation.
[4:12] And uh no matter sometimes how much you
[4:14] can break it down to people,
[4:17] the questions that are still there, I
[4:20] can tell are there from religious
[4:23] traditions.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. It's like they just
[4:26] don't want to let go. Like like the worm
[4:28] is pulling you but there's like one
[4:30] little hook left, you know, and you're
[4:32] like, "But what about that?"
[4:35] So, um, and it just it's very concerning
[4:38] for me that people cannot identify their
[4:41] experience correctly because that's
[4:43] that's like the main thing. It's like,
[4:44] "Bro, how do I know I've got the Holy
[4:46] Ghost?" Then you give them an answer.
[4:48] Thank you. They walk away. You can see
[4:51] gingerely like a cat moving away. But
[4:54] that one hook still remaining. But what
[4:56] about you know and um the thing about it
[5:00] is when you don't know what you've
[5:02] experienced and you can't identify your
[5:05] experience
[5:06] um this leads to you know um like
[5:10] failures it and and uncertainty and and
[5:14] eventually over a period of time it it
[5:16] results in loss of faith and I'm not
[5:19] saying loss of complete the the faith
[5:23] I'm just saying loss of faith and I was
[5:25] talking to my little boy yesterday and I
[5:27] was explaining to him the difference
[5:29] when you're a person who lives by faith
[5:31] and when you live by doubt. When you
[5:34] live by doubt and doubt takes over you,
[5:36] you are nervous. You are you are
[5:39] literally expecting everything to be
[5:41] bad. You are literally expecting um to
[5:45] go somewhere and and you're just your
[5:47] view of life is just negative. But when
[5:50] you live by faith, your life is
[5:52] positive. Amen.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; Your expectation is positive. And even
[5:56] when things go bad, you still you still
[5:58] think of the positive thing that that
[6:00] came out of the negative thing.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; That's a person who lives by faith,
[6:04] whose heart is filled with light. And
[6:06] and so that's what happens when you live
[6:09] in doubt of your salvation,
[6:12] of your experience with God. Then your
[6:16] entire existence in the message becomes
[6:18] one that's filled with nervousness. what
[6:21] people are going to say, what others are
[6:23] going to say, you know, uh, am I doing
[6:26] this right? Am I going to make the
[6:28] rapture? Am I really the bride? Which
[6:30] part am I? Am I just the church? Am I
[6:32] the foolish virgin? You know, it's it's
[6:35] just incredible the things that that
[6:37] people are struggling with today. So,
[6:39] they are plagued with so many questions
[6:41] because doubt has taken over. And there
[6:45] are even questions like how could I have
[6:48] lost faith?
[6:49] Uh, did Listen to this. How could I've
[6:53] lost faith? If I've lost faith now, does
[6:56] it mean I didn't have true faith in the
[6:58] beginning?
[7:00] &gt;&gt; You know, you you you can lose faith
[7:02] purely because bad things happened
[7:05] &gt;&gt; and it doesn't really mean anything. It
[7:07] just means a bad thing happened to you
[7:08] and you're a normal person after all.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; You thought you were an angel. just
[7:12] didn't realize you were flesh and blood
[7:15] human being and bad things happen to you
[7:16] and once in a while you have a bad day
[7:19] and at that day you you feel like I
[7:21] don't want to pray I don't want to read
[7:22] that's normal
[7:25] &gt;&gt; and at that day your faith can be low
[7:27] that's when you need the body to pick
[7:29] you up again or somebody to give you a
[7:31] call or somebody shares a scripture and
[7:33] then your faith comes back up everyone
[7:36] goes through that day brother Brandon
[7:38] said he went through that day he speaks
[7:39] about a juniper tree experience
[7:42] I mean, if ever you saw a prophet, one
[7:44] of the prophets, I mean, any one of them
[7:47] with the spirit of Elijah looked like
[7:48] they were depressed half the time.
[7:53] &gt;&gt; So, that's what I'm saying. This this
[7:56] question like, if I lost faith now in
[8:00] this trial, does that mean I never
[8:02] really had faith in the beginning? That
[8:04] is the enemy putting doubt in your mind.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; True.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I would like to speak on something
[8:09] that we picked up many years ago. Now
[8:10] you know this is the the treasure of
[8:14] spending time taking the cood books and
[8:17] going through all those questions with
[8:18] your people is you already pick up all
[8:22] the questions and uh you you then
[8:25] develop questions on those questions but
[8:27] just picking up the questions of the
[8:29] people in those days helped us to to go
[8:33] into things in the message. So uh what
[8:36] looked like a simple question turned out
[8:38] to be a phenomenal understanding that
[8:40] had to do with our experience with God
[8:42] and it highlighted so many things that
[8:44] we took for granted and some things we
[8:46] didn't uh we did not care to even know.
[8:50] So let's start by reading the question
[8:53] question and answers part four. This is
[8:54] 1964 30th of August. I hope you can read
[8:58] that 403 question 403. The question,
[9:03] this person's question is just amazing.
[9:06] For 1964, listen carefully. When you use
[9:10] the expression that if we do not believe
[9:13] the word, we will be eternally separated
[9:16] from Christ, do you mean the foolish
[9:19] virgin will live eternally, but they
[9:22] will be separated from the new Jerusalem
[9:25] where Christ will dwell with the bride?
[9:28] &gt;&gt; That's the first question. Most people
[9:30] pass over that question. Look at that.
[9:32] Because the prophet spoke about being
[9:34] eternally separated and we know he also
[9:37] says you can't be in hell and be
[9:40] eternal.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; This person understood you're not
[9:42] speaking about the people in hell being
[9:44] eternally separated. You're speaking
[9:46] about those people outside the city.
[9:49] &gt;&gt; And this is very good because the people
[9:51] outside the city did not have the same
[9:53] experience with God that we have.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; Right? So eternally separate. So for
[9:58] eternity will not be a part of the new
[10:00] Jerusalem but be the nations on the
[10:02] outside. But here's where it gets to
[10:05] what I want to talk about because then
[10:07] he says uh the question says here are
[10:10] those who do not have the Holy Spirit
[10:13] born again as the scripture speaks of
[10:16] being born again.
[10:19] So there are people
[10:21] who have received the new birth foolish
[10:24] virgin
[10:26] not the way the scripture speaks of
[10:28] right.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; And then it says if the natural birth
[10:33] requires water, blood and spirit, does
[10:37] not the spiritual require all three
[10:40] stages of grace before the person is
[10:42] truly born again?
[10:45] Amazing question, right?
[10:48] Now first I would like to say this
[10:50] question you know just completely
[10:53] amazing the the person seems to be more
[10:55] interested in uh the um the prophets um
[11:01] or rather
[11:03] um uh in in in the prophet's statements
[11:06] that he made about eternal separation
[11:09] and uh no eternal hell right and and
[11:12] about being eternally separated from
[11:14] Christ. That that looks like the
[11:16] question the person is asking that looks
[11:18] like what is paramount like the person
[11:20] wants to know does this fit in with that
[11:23] and is it because of the new birth like
[11:25] for example how can you have the full uh
[11:28] um justification sanctification baptism
[11:31] of the Holy Ghost and then be a foolish
[11:32] virgin like what's what's up with that
[11:35] and the person is asking like how can it
[11:37] be that these people are allowed to live
[11:40] eternally could it mean that they did
[11:43] not have a new birth the way it is
[11:45] scripturally spoken of. That's a
[11:48] brilliant question, right? You might not
[11:50] think so. I certainly think so. But uh
[11:53] we know there is no such thing as
[11:54] eternal hell because to be in hell for
[11:57] eternity requires eternal life. So if
[12:00] you have eternal life, you have the life
[12:02] of God. And if you have the life of God,
[12:05] what are you doing in hell?
[12:07] &gt;&gt; So we know that cannot be. So the person
[12:10] is rightly asking if eternal uh
[12:13] separation is linked to the foolish
[12:15] virgin and the nations without the holy
[12:18] city, the new Jerusalem and they are
[12:20] given eternal life but separated from
[12:22] the city. Right? Secondly, they seem to
[12:25] be linking the three stages of grace to
[12:28] the first question, right?
[12:31] justification, sanctification, baptism
[12:32] of the Holy Ghost, the person of Christ
[12:34] and linking that to the first question
[12:36] as if this may be the reason why they
[12:38] are eternally separated and not being a
[12:40] part of the city. Everyone got that?
[12:43] &gt;&gt; And then comes the prophet's answer
[12:47] which has nothing to do with what the
[12:49] person asked. And we're so used to that.
[12:52] It's incredible. Let's see. Let's go to
[12:54] his answer. He says, "Absolutely.
[12:57] Absolutely." What? I just explained that
[13:00] this morning. The same thing. The same
[13:02] thing. You've got to have all stages.
[13:05] You're begotten of the spirit just like
[13:08] a baby's begotten into the womb of a
[13:11] mother, but not born until they receive
[13:15] the Holy Ghost. That's right. You're
[13:18] born then. You're not converted. You're
[13:22] in a procession of being converted until
[13:26] that time. Right. The next one, that's
[13:30] the reason that all these great
[13:32] mysteries. Oh, this is amazing. That's
[13:36] the reason these great mysteries could
[13:37] not be given to Luther. Could not be
[13:40] given to Wesley, could not be given to
[13:42] that age that has just passed by us. The
[13:45] Pentecostal, which mean the mysteries
[13:47] could not be given to Luther, Wesley,
[13:48] and Pentecost. Why?
[13:51] I'm also asking why. It wasn't time.
[13:56] Here it is. They were begotten.
[14:02] They were begotten. He says there are
[14:04] three stages.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:05] &gt;&gt; Begotten, born and converted.
[14:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; He's saying those other three ages were
[14:11] just begotten.
[14:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Now the person of Christ himself, the
[14:17] son of man, you understand? Revealing
[14:20] himself in human flesh. It could not
[14:22] have come till now
[14:25] &gt;&gt; 1964.
[14:27] All right. So, his answer doesn't seem
[14:29] to answer the questions, but when you go
[14:32] between the lines, you get right. So,
[14:34] this brings me to my title.
[14:37] Uh, and uh
[14:41] uh the next the next one. Yeah. And one
[14:43] more. There we go. So, my title is
[14:47] begotten, born, and then converted.
[14:50] Okay. So, this is what we picked up
[14:52] many, many, many years ago. begotten,
[14:55] born and then converted. Now, his his
[14:59] answer seems to answer the question um
[15:02] on a completely different tangent. And
[15:05] you've got a lot of people in the
[15:07] message who when you speak of the three
[15:09] stages, they talk about justification,
[15:12] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[15:14] Ghost. Here is something completely
[15:17] different. I mean, it's linked to it,
[15:20] but he's saying your stages of growth of
[15:23] your salvation
[15:25] has got to do with being begotten,
[15:28] being born and converted.
[15:31] &gt;&gt; He says Luther, Wesley, and Pentecost
[15:34] were only in the begotten stage.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That's right.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; That's why the mysteries could not be
[15:39] revealed to them.
[15:41] &gt;&gt; And that's what we'd like to understand.
[15:42] So, I'd like to flesh this out.
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. so that you can understand your
[15:48] experience and you can know what's
[15:50] happening around us. Amen.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; So speaking in 1964 towards the end of
[15:56] the ministry and after the revealing of
[15:58] the seals he then indicates that if the
[16:01] natural birth requires three stages does
[16:05] not the spiritual birth require three
[16:07] stages of grace before the person is
[16:11] truly truly born again. Amen.
[16:15] So he says, so there's the three stages.
[16:17] I want to put this up on the screen for
[16:19] you. Number one is begotten of the
[16:22] spirit. Is it not there?
[16:25] Okay, don't worry about that. We'll
[16:28] we'll get back to that. Begotten of the
[16:30] spirit, born when you receive the Holy
[16:33] Ghost, and number three, the process of
[16:35] conversion. All right. So what amazes me
[16:38] is he identifies each stage as having a
[16:43] different experience.
[16:45] Not to be confused with the others.
[16:47] Everyone got that?
[16:48] &gt;&gt; Begotten is an experience. Born is an
[16:51] experience and conversion is an
[16:53] experience. Three different experiences.
[16:55] You could be living in either one. You
[16:58] could have been going through either
[16:59] one. The one most im important thing is
[17:02] you cannot go through the first the last
[17:04] one without the first one.
[17:06] You can't the you cannot be born unless
[17:12] you were begotten.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; True.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; And you definitely can't be converted
[17:17] without having been begotten.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Right. So this is what amazes me. He
[17:23] identifies each stage as having a
[17:25] different experience. Now it's very
[17:27] plain to see today that people are
[17:30] always confusing the stages. In other
[17:33] words, they have only um begotten.
[17:36] They're they maybe they are begotten.
[17:38] They're living in a begotten stage, but
[17:40] they think they've been born.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[17:44] &gt;&gt; And and and this is what I want to bring
[17:45] to you. It's amazing because this
[17:47] begotten stage is an amazing stage.
[17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; It's beautiful.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Brilliant.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; It's full of emotions. I'm going to
[17:54] describe it to you. But most people
[17:57] think they have been born again
[17:59] &gt;&gt; and they've just been begotten.
[18:02] But so that to me is uh is amazing. It's
[18:06] wonderful. But the most amazing of all
[18:09] that he says is the revelation of the
[18:12] mysteries
[18:14] only takes place in the conversion stage
[18:19] &gt;&gt; not in the begotten state. The mysteries
[18:21] cannot be revealed to you when you are
[18:24] begotten.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; And so we like to understand that. So
[18:27] let's come back to that scripture. 1
[18:29] Peter, just the slide before this,
[18:31] right? There we go. 1 Peter 3:5. So,
[18:35] watch what he says. Um, which according
[18:37] to his abundant mercy hath begotten us
[18:40] again.
[18:42] Okay, which means he's telling you the
[18:44] word again means you've already been
[18:45] begotten, but now you are being begotten
[18:48] again. So, when was the first time? The
[18:51] first time you were begotten in your
[18:52] mother's womb,
[18:54] &gt;&gt; physically, literally, but now you are
[18:56] begotten again by the spirit,
[19:00] right? While in these bodies of flesh,
[19:02] that means you've actually as a man or
[19:05] woman in this life. You have been born,
[19:07] you've grown up, you're you're a you're
[19:09] an adult, and now you're being born
[19:11] again.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; What does that mean?
[19:14] &gt;&gt; You've been begotten again. He starts
[19:16] there. He doesn't even say you're born
[19:17] again. He says you're begotten again.
[19:20] You've been conceived again.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Right. So, this is the reality I want to
[19:28] get to. Okay. And the the reality of
[19:30] this in our lives gets lost on us. I
[19:34] don't know you could probably see I'm
[19:35] really enjoying this already.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; So, and when we, you know, when we use
[19:40] spiritual language, we use religious
[19:42] language, we use uh Christian
[19:45] traditional language, we lose this. we
[19:48] lose the reality. It it it looks like
[19:50] we're talking about a salvation
[19:53] experience like it's something airy
[19:54] fairy, you know, like it's something so
[19:57] spiritual and you can only talk about it
[19:59] with like music playing or something,
[20:01] you know, and that uh it's it's in your
[20:04] imagination.
[20:06] It's actually so real
[20:08] &gt;&gt; that takes place with you in your life.
[20:10] You can you can um you can describe it
[20:13] in your in your actual uh reality,
[20:17] right? So that's what gets lost and
[20:20] that's what I don't like about the
[20:21] Christian experience must be real to
[20:23] you.
[20:23] &gt;&gt; It must be some it mustn't be something
[20:25] in your imagination. It's got to be
[20:27] real. Amen. So when you were conceived
[20:31] in the womb of your mother,
[20:33] you were a new beginning,
[20:36] right? When you were a little seed in
[20:38] the womb of your mother, you were that
[20:41] was your new beginning. Okay? It was a
[20:45] start of who you are today. Are you with
[20:49] me?
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Right? So you you are with me literally
[20:53] in the same room today. But long time
[20:57] ago, you were just a little seed in the
[20:59] womb of mom. Okay? And then you started
[21:02] to grow in them.
[21:04] It was that was the start of who you are
[21:07] today.
[21:08] From there, from mom, you were born
[21:14] and then you left mom.
[21:16] Is that right?
[21:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:18] &gt;&gt; You came out of the womb, you were born.
[21:20] You see the difference between begotten
[21:21] and born,
[21:23] &gt;&gt; right? So now you're leaving mom's body.
[21:26] You come out and now when you are born,
[21:28] you're starting to be educated
[21:32] because you are born this new clean page
[21:35] waiting to be written on.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; Right. And so you start to be educated
[21:39] and now the problem is from the time you
[21:42] are you are born you start to see this
[21:44] world you're living in your your page is
[21:47] being written on with worldliness with
[21:50] things of the world with the education
[21:52] of this life. Right? And you are now
[21:55] being educated. And then you grow up.
[21:57] You become a teenager. You become an
[21:58] adult. And then you meet the gospel. You
[22:03] meet the word. And what happens is you
[22:06] become reconceived.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; That's it. You literally have to become
[22:16] reconceived because your entire spirit
[22:20] has to be reprogrammed.
[22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it means to be
[22:25] begotten again. You can't skip that
[22:27] process.
[22:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; You literally have to be begotten,
[22:33] right? And then a new or rather a
[22:37] restart occurs.
[22:39] What is that? This is what I'm saying.
[22:41] The the reality of it must get you. You
[22:44] came, let's say you received the message
[22:45] when you were 21. Do you know what your
[22:48] your mentality, your spirit, your your
[22:51] view of life, your
[22:54] I you know I don't know what star you
[22:56] were born under. You were Sagittarius,
[22:59] you were Capricorn, whatever you were,
[23:01] you came with all those things, all that
[23:04] baggage and you you met the Holy Ghost.
[23:06] You met the word of God and now you are
[23:08] being born again. You are being begotten
[23:11] again. you're you're going back to and
[23:14] that's why Nicodemus asked, "Does a man
[23:16] have to go back into the womb of his
[23:17] mother to be born again?" He said, "No,
[23:20] but it's going to come by water, blood,
[23:21] and spirit."
[23:22] &gt;&gt; But it's nonetheless a reconception
[23:26] of yourself,
[23:28] &gt;&gt; of your spirit, a reprogramming, a
[23:32] restart. A lot of people come to this
[23:34] message and don't get the restart.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; You want the prophet's message. You want
[23:39] to read the books, but you don't want
[23:40] the restart.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; You have to be begotten.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Right. And have your spirit cleansed
[23:47] from the from the education you already
[23:50] achieved.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; Right. Being renewed in your spirit is
[23:55] to be re-educated
[23:57] by the spirit of God. And that's where
[24:00] they stop. Right? This is the reality of
[24:03] it. And I think that the phrase born
[24:06] again like uh people in the Pentecostal
[24:09] church, you know, they meet you at a bus
[24:11] station or bus stop, they meet you at
[24:13] work or something, or they see you
[24:15] randomly in the street and they walk up
[24:17] to you and are you born again?
[24:21] Right? We like those guys better than
[24:23] the 7day Adventist and Jehovah's
[24:25] Witnesses
[24:26] because you know these guys preach a
[24:29] short sermon.
[24:32] are you born again? And most likely they
[24:34] leave you after they pray for you and
[24:35] shake your head a little bit. And uh but
[24:38] this idea of being born again has been
[24:41] hijacked by this Pentecostal church.
[24:43] It's like they own the phrase.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Right. And all the Pentecostal church
[24:48] movements have become somewhat of this
[24:52] this experience of being converted from
[24:55] sinner to Christian.
[24:58] That's what they call being born again.
[25:00] being converted from a sinner to a
[25:02] Christian. All you have to do is say the
[25:04] sinner's prayer. You were a sinner
[25:06] yesterday and today you are a Christian.
[25:09] Converted. See?
[25:12] All right. And that's where they stop.
[25:15] That phrase can be used for anything.
[25:18] Uh for example, if you studied
[25:20] economics, I feel sorry for you. You
[25:23] know, it's boring in school. And then
[25:26] you decide to go into mechanical
[25:28] engineering which is a lot more
[25:30] exciting. And uh that's conversion. You
[25:33] converted from economics to mechanical
[25:36] engineering.
[25:38] Right? Conversion.
[25:41] You basically had a restart in
[25:43] education. You left economics and you
[25:46] went to mechanical engineering. You had
[25:49] a re-education
[25:51] into a new faculty. It's that simple.
[25:54] But that's where they stop at the
[25:56] re-education.
[25:58] That's where their excitement remains.
[26:00] They're they're having a party. They're
[26:03] having a jubilee. I've been re-educated.
[26:05] Praise the Lord.
[26:08] All that means is you took me away from
[26:10] the thinking of being a sinner or some
[26:12] other religion and you're now giving me
[26:14] the thinking of being a Christian.
[26:17] Hallelujah.
[26:18] Verse
[26:20] three tells us
[26:23] that we have been reconceived to a
[26:26] lively hope.
[26:28] That's where uh in the in the Bible the
[26:31] the word lively refers to being born and
[26:35] having the breath of life. He became God
[26:37] breathed into him the breath of life and
[26:39] he became a living soul. You are lively
[26:42] stones. Living is manifested having the
[26:46] breath of life in you. Amen.
[26:48] So we have been begotten unto a lively
[26:52] hope. That's what 1 Peter 1:3-5 tells
[26:56] us. Are you with me? And it also refers
[27:00] to something being manifested.
[27:03] So it's indicating not just an inward
[27:05] experience but an outward manifestation,
[27:10] something real.
[27:12] So it doesn't matter uh you know when
[27:15] you are begotten there is an outward
[27:17] manifestation when you are born again
[27:20] there is an outward manifestation when
[27:22] you are converted there is an outward
[27:24] manifestation there has to be a hope a
[27:27] lively hope it's not in your hand
[27:30] &gt;&gt; you don't say I'm begotten and then live
[27:33] like you did before you don't say I'm
[27:35] born again and live like you did before
[27:37] just living the same old me but yay I've
[27:40] been born here.
[27:43] Okay. And then it says in verse four, to
[27:48] a theophony. Of course, it doesn't say
[27:50] that, but we know it says that. To an
[27:54] inheritance incorruptible,
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; reserved in heaven for you. How do we
[27:59] know it's a theophony? Because verse 5
[28:01] says, who
[28:03] is ready to be revealed in the last
[28:05] days?
[28:06] &gt;&gt; It's a person.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Are you with me? So
[28:10] ready to be revealed in the last day
[28:13] means it's ready to be made known or
[28:16] manifest. That lively hope that
[28:18] theophony is reserved incorruptible.
[28:22] It's eternal in the heavens for you
[28:24] waiting to be revealed in the last day
[28:27] which comes under your seven thunders
[28:29] and coming out of seven seals. Are you
[28:32] with me? Now this literally tells us
[28:34] that our theophanes that are they are
[28:37] ready to be revealed in the last the end
[28:39] time. So I want to go through this three
[28:41] stages. I want to go through begotten,
[28:44] born and converted. Right? Are you with
[28:47] us?
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:48] &gt;&gt; The spiritual stages of our experience.
[28:50] And I want to make it plain to us so
[28:52] that we never have to doubt what it is
[28:55] we're going through in our stages of our
[28:57] life. So let's start with our restart,
[29:02] our re-education
[29:04] when we were conceived again. All right?
[29:08] And so, you know, that's what I want to
[29:11] challenge you on.
[29:13] You can't come to God and say, "I've
[29:16] been begotten."
[29:18] And then still come here with your own
[29:20] ideas, your old ideas,
[29:24] &gt;&gt; right?
[29:26] &gt;&gt; That's really ridiculous. You You have
[29:28] to understand that when you become
[29:31] uh when you are conceived again by the
[29:34] Holy Spirit, you become a new person.
[29:37] We're not you're not coming here to
[29:39] rehash some denominational ideas from
[29:41] 500 years ago like when I you meet some
[29:45] Orthodox Christians and they're
[29:48] literally living like as if they need to
[29:50] be in some cathedral in the Holy Land
[29:53] with clots over them holding a candle
[29:55] and swinging a ball and chain with smoke
[29:57] coming out of it. They might as well be
[29:59] that because they have literally no
[30:02] message for this day.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Nothing. It's dead. It's literally what
[30:07] you know that whitened sephil car filled
[30:09] with dead men's bones.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; It's literally that type of
[30:13] Christianity. There is nothing in there.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Like if you ask those people, you see
[30:20] this this little nun with this cloth
[30:22] over her head and she's wrapped up to
[30:24] everywhere. All you can see is this part
[30:26] of her face and you know she's got this
[30:28] holy Bible and she's and you ask her,
[30:30] "Sister,
[30:32] how do we overcome social media?
[30:37] Nothing. They literally have nothing.
[30:40] Oh, come. I'll pray for you, my son.
[30:45] They have no message.
[30:48] None of them. They're what I don't
[30:50] understand. If you defect to a
[30:53] denomination,
[30:55] you cannot tell me their message is
[30:57] better.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; There is literally nothing in the
[31:01] denomination.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[31:03] I I'll I'll tell you if you go there,
[31:05] you'll get like maybe 15 minutes of uh
[31:08] of preaching if you're lucky and then
[31:11] you'll get some politics and standup
[31:13] comedy. That's what you'll get. There's
[31:15] literally no message.
[31:18] So, if you defect from the message to go
[31:21] to a denomination,
[31:24] uh it's very clear something was wrong
[31:27] with you before that.
[31:30] There's there's no way you can tell me
[31:32] you're going to someplace better because
[31:34] what the message gives you. I'm telling
[31:36] you today what we preaching on is from
[31:38] one quote, one statement that you must
[31:41] be begotten, born and converted. Nobody
[31:44] else has said that.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Nobody in the world since the beginning
[31:48] of Christianity.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; So begotten. Amen. You can now put that
[31:58] weird picture up on the screen.
[32:01] All right. So, begotten is when you you
[32:06] have been conceived in your mother's
[32:09] belly. You can see that you look like an
[32:11] alien,
[32:14] right? There's there's nothing
[32:16] goodlooking about that. It looks awful.
[32:18] Looks terrible. But that in itself is a
[32:22] beautiful experience.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Only mothers find that cute,
[32:27] right? To me, you go there and you pay
[32:29] like so much for those scans, 40 scans
[32:31] and whatever. And you look at this blob
[32:33] there, you know, and oh, it's so cute,
[32:36] so precious. Look, listen to all the
[32:38] ladies going for us. It looks like some
[32:41] kind of jelly monster, right? That's
[32:45] what it looks like. We all were that
[32:47] once upon a time.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; But begotten as we understand from what
[32:52] brother man teaches refers to our
[32:56] spiritual conception
[32:58] becoming sons of God. Right? You with
[33:02] me? No man can come to me except my
[33:06] father draws him.
[33:08] &gt;&gt; There can be no conception but be uh
[33:12] without a father.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Without your father's seed, there
[33:16] is no conception.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; Right? The father has to draw you. So,
[33:22] brother said, "You didn't seek God."
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; He sought you.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; He says, "There's no man in the world
[33:31] who says, "I was searching for God." You
[33:33] can say, "You felt like it." That
[33:35] feeling you had that you were searching
[33:37] for God was God brooding over you.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Because he said in your natural state,
[33:44] you only desire what you want.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; You only desire to serve the pleasures
[33:49] of the flesh. If you felt any time in
[33:53] your life that you were searching for
[33:55] God, he already found you.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; That's your experience. He found you and
[34:01] then you thought you were searching for
[34:03] it.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; And then when he found you, you were
[34:08] still not begotten.
[34:10] It was still coming up.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:12] &gt;&gt; Right. So he starts brooding over you
[34:16] and bringing the word your way. Now
[34:18] what's God brooding over you? This is
[34:20] lovely.
[34:22] Car crash,
[34:25] sickness,
[34:27] family problem, like awful situation.
[34:30] And you're like, you wake up in a day
[34:32] somewhere.
[34:34] What is what is wrong with my life? What
[34:36] is going on? Why is this happening to
[34:38] me? All the time you just go in and bang
[34:41] in your head, bang in your head. All
[34:42] it's doing is making things happen so
[34:45] you can wake up and say, "I need God."
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:49] &gt;&gt; I need God. This there's something wrong
[34:51] here. Something not right. And then this
[34:54] is God brooding over you. And then you
[34:56] feel like, "Wow, what a coincidence." On
[34:58] this particular time, there's somebody
[35:00] there who's waiting to ask you the
[35:03] question. Have you heard about the
[35:04] message?
[35:06] You look like you need help. You know
[35:09] what? Have you read this book? Do you
[35:11] know about this prophet? Just look like
[35:13] a random person standing there. In the
[35:15] meantime, God was already working one
[35:17] year before you hit this spot.
[35:20] &gt;&gt; This is where the conception begins.
[35:23] This is where the seed gets revived. The
[35:26] gene seed that was in is excited and
[35:28] when it starts being conceived inside
[35:32] you, right? So uh he starts brooding
[35:36] over you and bringing the word your way
[35:39] for you to make your choice. The
[35:42] conception begins when you make your
[35:44] choice.
[35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't force himself on you,
[35:48] right?
[35:49] &gt;&gt; So when you make your choice and you
[35:51] accept Christ
[35:54] then and you accept the word for your
[35:55] day, then the gene seed in your soul
[35:58] begins to stir. That means you can be
[36:02] even sitting in a message church under
[36:05] message parents for 20 years and never
[36:09] be begotten.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; You've been sitting under an experience
[36:14] cuz you haven't made the choice yet.
[36:17] When the choice takes place inside you,
[36:22] then a life begins,
[36:25] right? And your soul begins to stir. And
[36:28] then brother Pam likens that in the
[36:31] natural birth and the life growing
[36:34] within a pregnant woman.
[36:36] So when you made the choice, it's like
[36:39] you're still inside mama.
[36:43] You're not born yet. You just made a
[36:45] choice. The seed has just started.
[36:48] Are you with me? So that's what I want
[36:50] to break out. I'm going to show you what
[36:52] that experience is. So the seed growing
[36:55] inside the baby starting to develop
[36:57] inside the mother. That gene seed
[37:01] attribute which has been sewn starts to
[37:03] develop within you the same as a fetus
[37:07] develops in the womb of its mother.
[37:10] Right? You you're getting a reset now.
[37:14] Now inside the womb, are you with me?
[37:19] Does he know mommy?
[37:21] No. Does he know daddy? No.
[37:26] Does he know who he is?
[37:28] No. He's got no identity,
[37:32] but he's definitely having an
[37:34] experience.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; And he's having an experience of his
[37:38] life,
[37:39] &gt;&gt; right? And yet he doesn't know mommy,
[37:42] daddy. He doesn't even know himself. But
[37:44] he's begotten.
[37:47] One thing's for sure, he's alive. He's
[37:49] begotten.
[37:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Right. And this is now after you wake up
[37:54] from this car accident. You met someone
[37:56] down the line in the hospital. I'm just
[37:58] making up some random stuff. You get in
[38:00] the hospital, you meet some nurse there
[38:02] who gives you a message book. You're
[38:03] reading. You can't do anything else cuz
[38:06] your leg is broken and you're lying on
[38:07] your back. Best time reading a book and
[38:10] then look on the other side, you see
[38:12] somebody's address and a phone number.
[38:14] You know what? Let's give it a shot. I'm
[38:16] miserable right now. What could go
[38:18] wrong?
[38:19] Phone them. Hey, brother. So and so okay
[38:23] don't worry we'll be there
[38:25] sprite next morning the message people
[38:27] are around your bed
[38:29] you know giving you the word next thing
[38:32] you know you're in church who are you
[38:35] still don't know
[38:36] &gt;&gt; you don't know daddy you don't know
[38:38] mommy you don't know anything but
[38:39] something is happening
[38:41] &gt;&gt; life is beginning
[38:43] &gt;&gt; right that's when you are begotten you
[38:46] are being reconceived
[38:48] what's going to happen is they're going
[38:49] to drag you into their church, you're
[38:51] going to walk in amongst all these
[38:53] happy, clappy strangers who dress so
[38:55] weirdly and it's strange and they sit
[38:58] and listen to services for like 2 hours.
[39:00] Like what's up with that? You know, you
[39:02] still don't know who you are. You still
[39:04] have no identity. You think, "Oh, okay.
[39:06] It's just another Christian church. What
[39:08] makes them so special?" Oh, yeah. You
[39:10] know, they they believe in Jesus Christ.
[39:12] And who's this the quotes they read? You
[39:14] know, who's this Brandham guy? And you
[39:17] know, like what's this cloud? Everyone
[39:18] has this weird white thing on them, you
[39:21] know, this cloud thing and these books
[39:23] they all read. You still don't know who
[39:26] you are. You still don't know anything.
[39:28] But nonetheless, you can't deny there's
[39:31] something about this place.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; There's some feeling. There's some
[39:35] excitement. There's some and then you
[39:36] think, well, that was interesting. After
[39:38] the first service, you go away and
[39:41] somehow these people seem to be calling
[39:43] you all week. You know, we're just
[39:45] checking on you. Are you okay? Hey, is
[39:47] everything fine? You need anything? You
[39:50] know, and then you realize and you might
[39:51] be going through this. You know what? My
[39:53] whole family, I'm stuck in hospital, my
[39:55] leg up in a thing, I'm on a stretcher or
[39:58] whatever, and my family, my friends, my
[40:00] own Pentecostal church doesn't check on
[40:02] me. And these new crazy people, they're
[40:05] on my case all the time. They're caring,
[40:07] they're visiting, they're bringing me
[40:09] food. You know, they're You still don't
[40:11] know mommy. You still don't know daddy.
[40:13] You still don't know who you are but
[40:15] something is taking place
[40:17] &gt;&gt; right and you then they start talking to
[40:19] you and they start telling you stuff. So
[40:21] this is where what is the conception?
[40:23] What is being begotten? You start to
[40:26] have a personal experience where you
[40:28] start realizing
[40:31] my life was being lived all wrong
[40:34] &gt;&gt; up to this point. And this fascinating
[40:38] idea starts to possess you that you
[40:41] should be different.
[40:44] Been living my life. I've been working.
[40:46] I've been driving my car. I've been
[40:47] doing stuff everyone else does. I've
[40:49] been watching the rugby and drinking
[40:51] beer and I've been doing all this. And
[40:53] you think you have this thought, I've
[40:57] been living my life wrong.
[40:59] H imagine you go and tell now your
[41:01] family that you've been living your life
[41:03] wrong. They'd be like, "You need another
[41:05] car accident, man. You lost your mind."
[41:08] Well, I mean, what's wrong with the
[41:09] rugby and the beer? What's wrong with
[41:11] the way we living? You know, you come up
[41:14] there and say, "Yeah, I don't really
[41:15] think I should wear shorts. I don't
[41:17] think I should do this." Oh, you think
[41:19] you're holier than thou now? You think
[41:21] you're better than us. And immediately,
[41:24] what's happened? You're being conceived
[41:26] elsewhere.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; This other life is being reset.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; See, and it's fascinating. And so this
[41:34] GSC is taken over and you uh you you
[41:38] become obsessed with being different. I
[41:40] want to be different. I want to dress
[41:43] differently. I want to dress like these
[41:44] people. I want to act like these people.
[41:46] I want to praise like them. I want to
[41:47] feel like them. I want to experience the
[41:49] look at the joy they have reading their
[41:51] Bible. I only read Psalm 23 for all my
[41:54] life.
[41:56] Right? And you realize your life was all
[41:59] wrong. And this this this idea begins to
[42:02] possess you. I want to be different in
[42:04] new life. You think it's you but a new
[42:07] life is already taking place. Right? And
[42:10] it's making you search for God. Now
[42:13] remember you thought you were but it was
[42:15] God who found you found you. But now you
[42:19] start to search for him. Okay? And it's
[42:22] something inside. And you and you're not
[42:24] even born yet.
[42:27] You're still only conceived. You're
[42:29] still begotten.
[42:33] So what happens is you're just coming to
[42:35] the church. You're inside mother. Mother
[42:39] is the church,
[42:41] &gt;&gt; right? And our new nature is not even in
[42:45] its infancy. You're not even a baby yet.
[42:48] You're still a fetus.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; You've just been begotten. Right. And
[42:53] right now you are drawing on mom.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; You are drawing on the strength of the
[42:59] mother.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Right. And on any mother who's had a
[43:03] pregnancy is going to tell you that's an
[43:05] experience that affects the whole
[43:07] church.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Any new believer, any new person who's
[43:12] baptized, any new person that comes in
[43:14] affects the whole body.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Right? And your new nature being not
[43:21] even in its infancy, it's drawing
[43:23] strength from mother. Literally, when a
[43:28] baby's inside the mother's womb, it's
[43:30] drawing from the blood of the mother.
[43:33] That's what that umbilical cord is. It's
[43:36] drawing iron and calcium and nutrients.
[43:39] And when um when a mom finds out she's
[43:41] pregnant, the doctor says, "Okay, you're
[43:43] going on killer fur. You're going on
[43:45] what's that green stuff?"
[43:48] Uh anyway, it's supposed to be um uh I
[43:52] actually forget that name. Thank
[43:53] goodness. No more kids. Uh it's a stuff
[43:57] it's the the the the the major thing
[43:59] that that deals with development of the
[44:01] spine and the bones and that's the first
[44:03] thing they start popping you with. And
[44:05] then you you're taking calcium and iron
[44:07] and all this stuff and then why because
[44:10] this child is drawing from the mother
[44:15] and then you know the excuse I'm eating
[44:17] for two, right?
[44:21] Well, it's it's draw really drawing out
[44:24] from the mother's blood and the mother's
[44:26] body drawing it all out, right? We know
[44:29] they were eating for for two before they
[44:30] were pregnant, you know, but now they're
[44:33] eating for two legally.
[44:36] So
[44:38] our our so our nature is not even in its
[44:41] infancy. We are drawing strength from
[44:43] the spiritual mother. So that means a
[44:45] new child or a new conception in the
[44:49] church starts to affect it. So when
[44:51] you're here, everyone is walking
[44:54] eggshells around you. Careful with you.
[44:57] They're there. Some of them who even,
[44:59] you know, dress recklessly because they
[45:01] know you're a new person. Next couple of
[45:03] weeks they're tighten up, you know, be a
[45:06] little bit more legalistic. Just show
[45:08] them what it really is. just affects
[45:11] everybody, you know, and and we've got
[45:13] to be careful with them. Make sure the
[45:15] song leading, maybe this happens, maybe
[45:18] uh the way we pray, let's let's not
[45:20] overdo it a little bit. Just just make
[45:22] them comfortable. Let's uh let's deal
[45:24] with them. And then you'll see the the
[45:26] teachers in the church start to rally
[45:27] around them and start to, you know, do
[45:29] you have any questions and can we answer
[45:31] anything? Would you like to have coffee
[45:33] with us and invite you over? And then we
[45:35] bring you over to, you know, a social
[45:37] where we're having stuff together. It's
[45:39] like you're being
[45:42] uh uh carefully nurtured.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; They're dealing with you kindly. They're
[45:48] dealing with you because you're fragile.
[45:50] They're being really nice. This will
[45:52] happen in any church, right?
[45:56] And so, do you know how a pregnancy
[46:00] affects a mother? That little seed gum,
[46:03] just that little speck. I mean it's
[46:06] they'll literally even tell you when
[46:08] it's a walnut size and then when it's a
[46:10] when it when it's an orange size like in
[46:13] nine week in the first nine weeks of
[46:16] pregnancy it actually you the mother
[46:18] actually starts having dental pain
[46:20] because that's how much of calcium it's
[46:22] drawing out. At that time they're
[46:24] telling you're supposed to be having a
[46:25] lot of calcium because you can you can
[46:27] start damaging your your dental uh
[46:30] quality if from the ninth week.
[46:34] Right? The poor mother doesn't know why
[46:36] her joy is aching. In the meantime, this
[46:38] baby is drawing out this calcium.
[46:41] And this the seed germ brings all these
[46:44] kinds of emotions. Here's the other
[46:45] thing, right? You come home one day and
[46:48] she's just crying. Husband doesn't know
[46:50] why she's crying. Why you crying? I
[46:52] don't know,
[46:55] right? She doesn't even know why she's
[46:56] crying. It's this baby doing that. It's
[46:59] drawing. In other words, there even
[47:01] emotional changes. Then she's waking up
[47:04] through the night. She's having
[47:05] nightmares. The weirdest dreams
[47:07] possible. And in the third trimester,
[47:10] it's even worse. They start having these
[47:12] crazy dreams, right? You just got to And
[47:15] brothers, if you're ever coming there,
[47:16] do not say anything like, "Honey, it's
[47:19] just the hormones." Don't worry, it's
[47:21] just the hormones. Just hold them. Hold
[47:23] them and listen to the story. Even if
[47:25] you lose 2 hours sleep at night, just
[47:27] hold them and say, "It's okay. It's
[47:29] okay."
[47:30] Right? Because this this is what I'm
[47:33] saying to you. When you're a new
[47:35] believer,
[47:36] you cause all sorts of emotional upsets
[47:39] in the church.
[47:42] But this is a wonderful experience. It's
[47:44] a beautiful experience. If you ask the
[47:46] mother the next day, she she didn't even
[47:49] sleep all night. She made us lose sleep,
[47:51] too. But the next day, she's bustling
[47:53] with this energy.
[47:55] And then we're we're going and then
[47:57] we're we're painting the nursery four
[47:59] times.
[48:00] I speak from experience.
[48:03] First this color was the right color,
[48:05] then it was the wrong color, then it was
[48:06] this wrong shade, then we painted by the
[48:08] time of fourth on the fourth stage. And
[48:10] then she's like nice and round and
[48:12] you're the best husband.
[48:14] You like painted the nursery four times,
[48:18] right?
[48:20] That's what's going to happen. I mean,
[48:21] it's such a an enjoyable,
[48:24] difficult, emotional roller coaster ride
[48:27] experience is what it is to be having a
[48:30] person in the begotten stage in a
[48:33] church.
[48:35] It's like a you if you ever seen people
[48:37] in the message like
[48:40] really become weirdly excitable is when
[48:44] someone is baptized.
[48:46] They are like they could have been
[48:48] depressed the day before and someone is
[48:49] baptized and they're whooping and
[48:51] screaming.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glory to God. We're so
[48:53] happy. There's another soul uh you knowh
[48:57] ready to go to heaven. They're just
[48:59] rejoicing. You know, we feel so good.
[49:01] Let's go have some special lunch, you
[49:04] know, just because somebody uh got
[49:06] baptized. This is what it's like. And so
[49:10] first with this creature inside the womb
[49:14] is this insatiable hunger cuz they want
[49:17] every question answered now
[49:21] like like you could like it's with
[49:24] someone brother can't you just download
[49:26] everything for me
[49:27] &gt;&gt; that that only happened in the last two
[49:29] decades
[49:30] &gt;&gt; when the word download came into
[49:32] existence prior to that we had to
[49:34] struggle with teaching you with paper
[49:35] and pen and diagrams and sit with You
[49:38] remember, brother Mark?
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Going through 4 in the morning, we're
[49:41] all sitting together and drawing things
[49:44] out and questioning and arguing and oh,
[49:46] it was glorious.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; But nowadays, they want it downloaded.
[49:51] You know, can't you just some way can I
[49:54] just get the whole seventh seal in like
[49:56] 5 minutes? It'll do me so good. Sorry,
[49:59] brother. This is a begotten state. You
[50:01] got to go through this.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; See this and this hunger. Um, it brings
[50:06] a hunger for God. Brother speaks about
[50:08] this in thinking man's filter. So just
[50:10] your presence in a church brings a
[50:13] church into turmoil right and the
[50:15] presence of the gene seed in your soul
[50:17] sets your body into a turmoil.
[50:21] So remember you are uh conceived again
[50:26] and the church is being given an
[50:29] experience. You are having that
[50:31] experience with the church but also
[50:33] individually inside of you that gene
[50:36] seed is causing trouble for this body
[50:38] that you're living in.
[50:41] All right? Because both the church and
[50:44] this body is an incubator for the gene
[50:47] seed.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. A living incubator. So the same
[50:51] way the gene seed in you is causing your
[50:54] body to react differently to the world
[50:57] because imagine now you got this gene
[50:59] seed inside. You go back, you're living
[51:00] with the same worldly family you grew up
[51:03] with. Now you're changing your room
[51:05] around. You're kicking stuff out. You're
[51:07] changing your wardrobe around. Then
[51:09] eventually some of it, some of us had it
[51:12] so bad you get kicked out of the house.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; And you got to go find another place.
[51:16] That's how bad it is. Gets really,
[51:18] really difficult. And uh uh you people
[51:22] at work see you change. People at work
[51:24] see your dressing and think, "What
[51:26] happened?"
[51:28] Right? what's going on? And then of
[51:30] course there's the cravings.
[51:33] Now it's the the cravings of the mother
[51:37] will go straight to the father cuz the
[51:40] father has to buy the food,
[51:42] &gt;&gt; right? I'm feeling for this. I'm feeling
[51:45] for that. We don't know why we're
[51:46] feeling for that. But there's somebody
[51:47] new in church. And look, you'll find
[51:49] brother Allan bring the question. You
[51:50] know, brother Allah, I think you need to
[51:52] go through the seals again. I think you
[51:54] need to go through the church ages
[51:55] again. I don't know why he knows why
[51:57] he's asking me this. or why he's telling
[51:59] me. But that's that's just it. There's
[52:01] this people in the church who are
[52:02] sensing something, feeling something.
[52:04] They come up with a question and then
[52:06] it's drawing something out from the
[52:07] ministry and we're answering that. What
[52:09] are we doing? Dealing with cravings
[52:12] just because of you,
[52:16] right? And emotional distress,
[52:19] bodily upset. One of the biggest things
[52:21] for a mother is bodily upset. Why? It
[52:24] literally is changing her body. It's
[52:26] causing her to swell. It's causing it to
[52:28] move differently. The church starts to
[52:30] slow down because someone is begotten.
[52:34] Well, we were moving at a speed before.
[52:36] Now we got to slow down. Even in the
[52:38] preaching, sometimes I I'm so much aware
[52:40] of it. If there's a new person in the
[52:42] church, and when I say new person, I
[52:44] mean even somebody who's been here like
[52:46] 5 years, I'm going to have to say things
[52:48] in a way that everyone understands it,
[52:51] including them.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Which means I'm going to have to break
[52:53] it down to the simplest kind of form.
[52:56] And I'm conscious of that, right?
[53:00] Because you're dealing with
[53:02] someone who is begotten. And and we know
[53:06] they haven't reached there yet. They
[53:08] haven't come to their new birth yet.
[53:12] Labor pains just before the birth. Of
[53:14] course, the bodily pains and then just
[53:16] before the birth itself, there is labor
[53:19] pains. labor pains. If I had to put that
[53:21] to you spiritually, that's going to be
[53:24] the part where your life is turned
[53:26] upside down,
[53:28] right? You come to this message,
[53:29] something's going to happen, things are
[53:31] going to happen with you personally. I
[53:33] cannot describe it. I cannot even give
[53:35] you a a scenario that works for everyone
[53:38] because it's different for everyone.
[53:41] The new birth is different for everyone,
[53:44] right? But all we know is you're there's
[53:47] going to be labor pains to bring you out
[53:49] to be the person to be born. There's
[53:51] going to be labor pains, right? So
[53:53] you've got all this uh then is your
[53:57] period. This this this labor pains you
[54:00] you're going through justification.
[54:02] You're going through sanctification. You
[54:04] still have no revelation of who God
[54:06] really is. You're still struggling a
[54:09] little bit to understand the Godhead. So
[54:11] he's kind of making sense. you know
[54:14] these you still got questions you're
[54:15] hearing questions from your family from
[54:17] your work colleagues because you trying
[54:18] to share this with them something you
[54:20] don't know anything about or barely know
[54:22] everything about yet and then you come
[54:24] to me and you ask me and I say to you
[54:27] well I know I don't know everything
[54:28] about it either you know and then oh
[54:31] well you look at me kind of like okay
[54:34] then you go back and answering question
[54:36] from family and friends and you you're
[54:38] excited you you think you got this great
[54:40] thing you go and share it with someone
[54:42] and they totally slam you and tell them
[54:44] I don't want to see you again. You were
[54:45] in with this cult people,
[54:50] right?
[54:51] And um you have
[54:54] you're learning the stuff in this in
[54:56] this message, but you still have no
[54:58] revelation of who God really is yet,
[55:02] right? And you don't even know who you
[55:04] are yet.
[55:06] I think of it that little baby in the
[55:08] womb. It doesn't even know its name. It
[55:11] doesn't know its mom and dad. It doesn't
[55:12] know its family. It doesn't know whether
[55:13] it has siblings. It hasn't seen its
[55:15] house yet. It hasn't even seen that
[55:18] nursery that's been painted four times.
[55:22] Right? You are learning all the basics
[55:25] of what you should be like from
[55:27] everything around you. Right? So uh and
[55:30] and and all that's around you is just
[55:32] this incubator, this really comfortable
[55:36] place that you were living in and you're
[55:37] hearing these sounds and these beautiful
[55:39] sounds and mother is protecting you and
[55:42] you know you're just being pampered but
[55:44] you're in an incubator, right? And still
[55:47] the seed is not air, right? With the
[55:50] shock, there's something else happening.
[55:53] You are learning all the basics of what
[55:55] you should be like with everything
[55:56] around you. And this is why things can
[55:58] go so wrong when something goes wrong in
[56:00] the church and in your body. In other
[56:03] words, at that time, you're a begotten
[56:06] Christian and the church goes through a
[56:07] split
[56:09] or a fight or something happens and
[56:13] you're just a new believer. You're just
[56:15] begotten and it's like turmoil. What's
[56:18] what's going on right now? I thought
[56:19] these people were these, you know,
[56:21] beautiful perfect people,
[56:23] &gt;&gt; right? also in yourself. You just you
[56:26] had this accident. You ever go through
[56:28] the whole thing again? You got to the
[56:29] hospital. You someone gave you a book.
[56:31] You met these people. They brought you
[56:33] to your church. And then later down the
[56:35] line, they're telling you, you know
[56:36] what? There was a fracture in your back.
[56:40] We missed that. Now you got And now
[56:41] you're thinking, "Lord, I came to you. I
[56:44] I accepted this message. Now I've got
[56:47] this news. This is what I'm talking
[56:49] about."
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Right? these things things go wrong and
[56:53] something goes wrong in your body and
[56:55] the gene seed is still going to use
[56:57] whatever experience to bring the reset.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; You have to be re-educated.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the here's the problem.
[57:09] Every revival brings forth
[57:12] &gt;&gt; twins.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; So, remember at the church the church at
[57:16] this stage is bringing forth twins.
[57:18] Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; So there are those who are begotten of
[57:22] the right seed and those who are
[57:24] begotten of the wrong seed also around
[57:27] you sometimes
[57:28] &gt;&gt; and you're drawing from the same
[57:30] ministry and enjoying the same warmth of
[57:33] the same womb, the same church that so
[57:37] means you might even come into a message
[57:39] church and you're meeting all the people
[57:41] and you're just meeting some other
[57:43] people
[57:44] &gt;&gt; that are also in there but they're just
[57:46] waiting to flock around you and give do
[57:48] something wrong or make you or speak
[57:51] against somebody else to you or or tell
[57:53] you something that it that you can see
[57:55] why is this person discouraging me?
[57:57] What's going on here? You know why? Why
[57:59] are they even telling me this? You know,
[58:00] like be careful of this. You know, in
[58:02] this church there are these clicks. That
[58:04] group gets along that group, that one,
[58:06] you know, you could stick with me.
[58:09] This is what you get in churches, right?
[58:12] And so there's always twins. So also
[58:15] when you apply that to your own life,
[58:18] you have the days when the the chosen
[58:21] one is jubilant and exciting and
[58:24] rejoicing and is loving the word and the
[58:27] other one is the other twin.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Remember that other twin was born before
[58:32] you.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; He is the older one. He is always
[58:36] dominating. He's always the one who's
[58:38] going to say, "You know what? Next week
[58:40] I don't really want to go to church. I
[58:42] want to go to my old church. I'm going
[58:44] to look at something else, you know. I I
[58:46] want to uh experience something
[58:48] different. Maybe let's just go back to
[58:51] the rugby and have a beer and see how
[58:52] that works out,
[58:54] you know, like my old life. The older
[58:56] twin is always going to be pushing back.
[58:58] So, this is another part of the
[59:01] conception process.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; You're not going to be away from that
[59:05] experience. There is always going to be
[59:07] the other twin there, right? And so same
[59:11] womb,
[59:13] different seed, same atmosphere,
[59:16] same religion if you want to put it that
[59:19] way. And in so in you a nature, another
[59:22] nature is is moving alongside you. Okay?
[59:27] And then we are born.
[59:30] Okay?
[59:31] Now
[59:33] this is the part where you are coming
[59:36] out from the mother's womb.
[59:39] Okay. But even in the born again
[59:42] experience, this is what I want to bring
[59:44] you to. You are still connected to
[59:47] mother,
[59:49] right? Because as a baby, you're an
[59:51] infant. You are still depending on the
[59:53] church.
[59:55] Are you with us? Let's read question and
[59:56] answers part three.
[59:59] Paragraph 276. Paragraph page 1121. the
[1:00:02] the man had followed him for three three
[1:00:04] years and had a name on the lamb's book
[1:00:06] of life and cast out devils and done
[1:00:08] great works talking about Peter and
[1:00:10] healed and preached the word and
[1:00:12] everything that's and still wasn't
[1:00:13] converted.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; You're leading to conversion. You see
[1:00:17] what I'm saying?
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; You could have gone around preaching the
[1:00:21] word, doing great works, being a part of
[1:00:24] the evangelical services, casting out
[1:00:27] devils, and you're still not born.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; You're still begotten.
[1:00:33] 277. You see, that's what I mean. You
[1:00:37] could have been part of that. You could
[1:00:38] have been hearing the message in Durban
[1:00:40] for like 40 years. You could be like
[1:00:43] being a part of every evangelical move.
[1:00:45] You could be preaching the word. You
[1:00:47] could have you could have testimonies of
[1:00:49] casting out devils, praying for the
[1:00:51] sick, the sick being healed, and you're
[1:00:54] still only begotten.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; You're not even born yet. Amen.
[1:01:00] Well, the man says that and he's
[1:01:01] referring to Peter
[1:01:05] when the par 277 when the act was has
[1:01:09] taken place between the egg and the
[1:01:10] sperm or the gene. Uh but when the
[1:01:13] potentially the baby's there when the
[1:01:16] act is done then the body is developed
[1:01:20] second stage but the baby has to be born
[1:01:23] here then receives the breath of life.
[1:01:26] It's not yet the breath of life. You say
[1:01:28] oh it's alive. No it isn't. There's
[1:01:30] little nerves jerking muscles. The baby
[1:01:32] hasn't received life till it's born. And
[1:01:35] you may jump and jerk, but you're not.
[1:01:38] You got to be born. You know what I
[1:01:40] mean? All right.
[1:01:42] I got to stop there and just put this in
[1:01:45] cuz in this world today, there's this
[1:01:46] whole argument with abortion where they
[1:01:49] say uh it's not alive. That's an
[1:01:53] academic reasoning to say that it's not
[1:01:55] alive. And now you we'll read in the
[1:01:57] message. Brother man says, "No, it's not
[1:01:58] alive until it gets a breath of life."
[1:02:00] You see? No, you see nothing.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; That's still wrong.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. Of course, it has life in it,
[1:02:08] which comes from the spark of life. You
[1:02:10] can hear him say this in other places in
[1:02:12] the message. When the two come together,
[1:02:14] egg and sperm come together, the spark
[1:02:16] of life that comes in there. But when
[1:02:19] you become manifesting,
[1:02:22] manifesting is having the breath of life
[1:02:25] mean becoming your own person.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Right. That's when you are truly living.
[1:02:32] He doesn't mean you're dead.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't say something so silly.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; Of course, you're not dead in your
[1:02:38] mother's womb. You are alive.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; But you're not living.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; There it is. You are alive but you're
[1:02:48] not living.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Because you're alive and you're cocoon.
[1:02:52] You're incubated.
[1:02:54] You're not manifesting yourself.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; You have no identity. You don't know
[1:03:00] anybody. You don't know mom. You don't
[1:03:01] know dad. Are you with us?
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; So, brother is saying you still got to
[1:03:07] be born. Okay. So, when a baby is born
[1:03:11] now, the baby comes out of mom. There he
[1:03:13] is in that little swaddling cloth and
[1:03:15] there he's born. Now he's seeing mom for
[1:03:18] the first time. This is where he starts
[1:03:21] to identify. A lot of things start to
[1:03:23] happen. When you are born again of the
[1:03:26] spirit, right? And this is receiving the
[1:03:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost, being
[1:03:31] baptized into one body. This is when you
[1:03:34] actually become a part of the body.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; You start to recognize the identity of
[1:03:41] mom.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. You start to see the purpose of the
[1:03:44] church. You start realizing a lot of
[1:03:47] things. Your first identity you are
[1:03:49] getting is the identity of mom.
[1:03:52] And the identity of mom is going to stay
[1:03:54] with you for a very long time. That's
[1:03:57] what it means. By one spirit are we all
[1:03:59] baptized into one body. That's what the
[1:04:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost does to you.
[1:04:04] It inducts you into the body.
[1:04:07] Right?
[1:04:08] And you are only truly born again when
[1:04:11] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:12] Ghost for your day. Right? So when the
[1:04:16] new conception has taken place in you,
[1:04:18] your re-education starts and it starts
[1:04:22] living in you. But when you are born
[1:04:24] again, right? That's when you recognize
[1:04:27] the identity of the church. Why? The
[1:04:30] Holy Ghost gives you power to live
[1:04:33] what you have just believed. Prior to
[1:04:37] that, you were just a parasite drawing
[1:04:40] off mama.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; But now when you are born, you receiving
[1:04:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is being
[1:04:48] given the power to live what you've
[1:04:51] believed. You started believing.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; But you were not living yet.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Now you can start living and you are not
[1:05:01] directly affected by the emotions of the
[1:05:04] church anymore. Right?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; So you're not connected by umbilical
[1:05:07] cord to mom anymore. You're now your own
[1:05:09] individual and the church is around you
[1:05:11] and you are associating yourself. You
[1:05:14] are getting this feeling of togetherness
[1:05:15] with everyone. Right? And yet not
[1:05:18] directly connected to the emotions and
[1:05:21] motions of the church. The church has
[1:05:23] become a second parent to you now. First
[1:05:27] it was the only parent. Now it's become
[1:05:30] a second parent because you're starting
[1:05:33] to see this other guy.
[1:05:36] This guy you never got used to before.
[1:05:39] You're starting to see this dad fell.
[1:05:43] He's always hanging around.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Right. You start to recognize there's
[1:05:48] somebody beyond the church.
[1:05:51] There's another parent.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Right. And now you want to get to know
[1:05:56] that one. But you're still bound to
[1:06:00] mama.
[1:06:02] That's still the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:03] Ghost.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; So the church has become the second
[1:06:06] parent and the church is this tutor.
[1:06:09] So you know, you go out and you make a
[1:06:11] little mistake and they come back. Hey,
[1:06:13] come here. Come here. That's not really
[1:06:15] how we do things here. You know, this is
[1:06:17] this is how it works. And that's mama
[1:06:20] correcting you. That's the church, you
[1:06:23] know, bringing you to you're you're
[1:06:25] under tutors and governors. Are you with
[1:06:28] me?
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; And the problem is people think when you
[1:06:32] got saved
[1:06:34] that was right people think that's when
[1:06:37] you got saved that that was just
[1:06:39] begotten right they don't know in this
[1:06:42] time you are born when the Holy Ghost
[1:06:44] does something to you that is relevant
[1:06:46] for your day.
[1:06:49] So the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are
[1:06:50] receiving for your day is God giving you
[1:06:54] something. You are being born. You are
[1:06:56] being given a purpose, some identity
[1:07:01] with the church. You are identifying
[1:07:04] yourself with the identity of the church
[1:07:06] that is your mother.
[1:07:10] Are you with me?
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; For example, it'll be totally crazy for
[1:07:15] you to be here in this church and say,
[1:07:18] "Well, I want to follow the Catholic
[1:07:20] purpose."
[1:07:22] That's not going to happen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; That's just silly. Yes.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; So in other words, when the baptism of
[1:07:28] the Holy Ghost comes upon you, it's
[1:07:29] going to give you the purpose of this
[1:07:31] body.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; You are going to be unified with the
[1:07:35] purpose of the body. You don't even have
[1:07:38] your own purpose yet.
[1:07:40] You've got the purpose of the body. And
[1:07:42] the purpose of the body is going to be
[1:07:44] multiffold, right? The word, the
[1:07:47] worship, the uh dealing with helping
[1:07:50] with people, all kinds of different
[1:07:52] things. You're going to be part of the
[1:07:54] purpose of mother. Are you still with
[1:07:58] me?
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; You are born again today by the opening
[1:08:03] of the seventh seal to you personally
[1:08:06] today. Your new birth comes from what
[1:08:09] happened under the seventh seal.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; Your new birth today is not the same as
[1:08:13] a Pentecostal new birth. It's not the
[1:08:16] same as a Methodist new birth or some
[1:08:18] other kind of new birth. Your new birth
[1:08:20] today, you only come into the purpose of
[1:08:23] the the true bright church when the
[1:08:26] seventh seal opens to you.
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Prior to that, you were just begotten.
[1:08:34] Try it. Test your life and tell me.
[1:08:38] You were living under the guise of a
[1:08:41] born again experience according to
[1:08:42] Pentecostals. Right.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; But you know when the open book opened
[1:08:47] up to you, you know what happened then?
[1:08:51] Prior to that, you were just living
[1:08:53] cocooned.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; When that opened up, that's when you
[1:08:57] start recognizing where your purpose is.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to paragraph 116 or page
[1:09:06] 1165, paragraph 57. Notice a mother. She
[1:09:09] can be ever so mean and cruel. Just
[1:09:11] before the baby's born, there's a sweet,
[1:09:13] a certain kindness that sets in. Do you
[1:09:15] ever notice a mother when she's to be a
[1:09:17] mother, that means when she's about to
[1:09:18] give birth, something sweet about her.
[1:09:20] She always takes on that real sweetness.
[1:09:22] That little angel spirit, a little
[1:09:24] messenger to this little tabernacle is
[1:09:26] ready to come forth into the world. And
[1:09:27] then when this little angel comes into
[1:09:29] the body, that's a little angel of the
[1:09:31] earth, the baby, a spirit that's
[1:09:33] ordained of God to take this body. Then
[1:09:36] that baby has to have a choice. It makes
[1:09:38] it decision. this then then when this
[1:09:41] takes place when you see the angel of
[1:09:42] the lord now comes in which is a
[1:09:44] spiritual body that's eternal uh parable
[1:09:48] 58 this is a dying spirit in a dying
[1:09:50] body but now you can't be in two bodies
[1:09:52] at one time but there can be two natures
[1:09:55] in you at one time now the nature of the
[1:09:57] spirit the lord when you're born again
[1:10:00] you're not born of physical like the
[1:10:02] baby was but what's happened the
[1:10:04] spiritual birth has come to you and
[1:10:06] while the spiritual birth is growing
[1:10:08] into your heart of God. There's a
[1:10:10] physical or celestial body growing to
[1:10:13] receive that spirit. When the life
[1:10:15] leaves this body, it goes to that body.
[1:10:17] Just as when the body is presented to
[1:10:19] the earth, that spirit comes in. When a
[1:10:21] spirit goes out of the body, there's a
[1:10:23] body waiting for we. So that's what we
[1:10:25] read in 1 Peter 3
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; 1:3, right? For this body will be
[1:10:29] dissolved and will take on the other
[1:10:31] one.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; So how do you know when you are born
[1:10:33] again?
[1:10:35] How do you know when you are born again?
[1:10:38] Because this is the confusion people are
[1:10:40] having now. It's not when the word
[1:10:43] starts making sense to you cuz the word
[1:10:46] started making sense to you a long time
[1:10:47] ago.
[1:10:49] Depending on how people broke it down to
[1:10:52] you, a lot of things will make sense and
[1:10:54] then other things don't make sense.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; This is a perfectly supernatural
[1:10:59] experience.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; When the word starts revealing itself,
[1:11:06] when it's becoming revelation,
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; you are quickened to revelation
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; because upon this rock I'll build my
[1:11:16] church.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Not upon this education, not upon this
[1:11:21] making sense.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Upon this revelation
[1:11:25] rock, I'll build my church. So the new
[1:11:28] birth takes place when you start to
[1:11:30] receive revelation.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Now take it back to the baby. What
[1:11:35] revelation does a baby have in the womb?
[1:11:38] Nothing.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; What revelation does a baby have when
[1:11:42] it's born?
[1:11:44] It's still can't speak. It doesn't it's
[1:11:46] seeing mother. it. At that moment when a
[1:11:50] baby is looking at its mother, there's
[1:11:52] no neurons connecting saying, "Hey,
[1:11:54] you're the one whose stomach I was
[1:11:56] inside."
[1:11:58] You know, you look nice or you don't
[1:12:01] look so good. You know,
[1:12:05] the baby doesn't have any of those
[1:12:07] thoughts. Just smiling stupidly.
[1:12:11] Ah,
[1:12:12] feed me.
[1:12:14] That's all. Right. It still doesn't know
[1:12:17] anything. He's got no identity. And
[1:12:19] that's the thing about when you're
[1:12:20] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[1:12:22] you are quickened into something. You
[1:12:24] don't even know anything. You just have
[1:12:25] a revelation.
[1:12:27] Revelation. Something inside the baby is
[1:12:30] telling this this child, I'm connected
[1:12:33] to you.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You and me,
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; I can't prove it. I don't never read any
[1:12:42] quotes. I don't know anything but you
[1:12:44] and me.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're together.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; That's the thing. And upon this rock,
[1:12:50] what did what did Peter say to Christ?
[1:12:52] That was the Christ, the son of the
[1:12:53] living God. Flesh and blood had not
[1:12:56] revealed us to you. You know, and that's
[1:12:58] the thing about mothers and parents and
[1:13:01] babies. I don't know how babies can have
[1:13:03] anything make sense because the parents
[1:13:06] don't even speak English to them.
[1:13:12] What kind of revelation or sense can a
[1:13:14] child make when you talk like that to
[1:13:16] the child? H everything goes bad from
[1:13:20] there. You call them all, you name them,
[1:13:23] you know, some really fancy name with
[1:13:25] their grandparents and whatever and then
[1:13:27] you call them like Pooky
[1:13:29] for 10 years, you know,
[1:13:34] Nunie, Marshmallow, Munchkin. And I'm
[1:13:36] walking around like, why do we bother
[1:13:38] naming this child?
[1:13:40] You know, if you're going to name, how
[1:13:42] is this child going to have any identity
[1:13:44] or revelation when you keep calling him
[1:13:46] something that is not even his name?
[1:13:49] I feel sorry for babies. You know, like
[1:13:52] what kind of revelation are they
[1:13:53] supposed to have when they're not even
[1:13:54] being spoken to in English?
[1:13:59] You laugh. That happens in churches.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; You got these new people coming to these
[1:14:04] churches and these ministers are
[1:14:06] thrashing out stuff they don't even
[1:14:08] understand. Absolutely.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Just
[1:14:11] nonsense. Just buzzwords. Just fancy
[1:14:15] words to make mom and dad look really
[1:14:17] caring or something. But they're not
[1:14:19] getting anything. They're just enjoying
[1:14:22] this whole hype. I always think from the
[1:14:25] from the eyes of a child. The child is
[1:14:28] lying there and we're we're standing
[1:14:30] there over them acting really goofy and
[1:14:33] stupid.
[1:14:34] And this child is just smiling. And the
[1:14:36] more the child smiles, the more we put
[1:14:38] on a show. I feel like such a crazy
[1:14:41] person doing that, you know. But
[1:14:45] sometimes they just draw it out of you.
[1:14:49] And so how do you know when you are born
[1:14:52] again? That is when the word starts
[1:14:54] revealing itself to and you are
[1:14:56] quickened to it. Right? What is the
[1:14:58] evidence of the Holy Ghost? Right? Once
[1:15:01] you are born again, you are his.
[1:15:05] Right. So 1 John 3:9 says, "Whoever is
[1:15:09] born born of God does not commit sin,
[1:15:12] for his seed remainth in him, and he
[1:15:15] cannot sin because he is born of God."
[1:15:18] So at this point, at this point, when
[1:15:21] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:15:23] Ghost, you are no longer going to
[1:15:25] disbelieve. You cannot disbelieve God's
[1:15:28] word. Right? There are no when you are
[1:15:30] truly I'm not talking about someone who
[1:15:32] just receives some kind of anointing
[1:15:34] right you there are no doubts about him
[1:15:36] you like you don't you can't explain
[1:15:39] anything but you know mom you know dad
[1:15:42] revelation is from the very beginning
[1:15:44] revelation is the key are you with me so
[1:15:48] remember your older twin has also
[1:15:51] received the Holy Ghost
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; anointing but has the wrong seat your
[1:15:56] twin has also been born but But the seal
[1:16:00] is not upon him. He has no
[1:16:02] representation. Has not been connected
[1:16:04] to a theophony. Has no heavenly body
[1:16:07] waiting to receive him. He does not know
[1:16:10] this. And he thinks he's very much like
[1:16:12] you and a part of you.
[1:16:14] We know that someday he's going to
[1:16:16] leave. Right? But he is the one that is
[1:16:20] able to sin.
[1:16:22] Now I'm talking to you personally inside
[1:16:25] you. The gene seed can never sin.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; He is born of God.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; But this thing still has attributes of
[1:16:34] unbelief in it.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; This older twin is still going to do
[1:16:39] wrong stuff even though you've been born
[1:16:42] again.
[1:16:46] Are you with me? that this is the
[1:16:48] trouble that I don't know modern or I
[1:16:52] would say current message people are
[1:16:55] struggling to come to terms with like
[1:16:57] since I preach on the Holy Ghost in
[1:16:59] North America I'm getting questions like
[1:17:01] you know what isn't the Holy Ghost
[1:17:03] supposed to take away all this stuff are
[1:17:05] we not supposed like the last service we
[1:17:07] did are we still going to be doing bad
[1:17:09] things and I'd explain that you know and
[1:17:13] it's like I thought the Holy Ghost takes
[1:17:14] away even the feeling of this and takes
[1:17:16] away God does. No, it doesn't.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; You are still going to go through stuff.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Right. He uh so what you need to
[1:17:27] understand like Paul says when I want to
[1:17:30] do good evil is present.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; And he says who can save me from the
[1:17:34] body of this death? I don't want to go
[1:17:35] through all that again. But that's the
[1:17:37] other twin.
[1:17:39] That's the old nature you were born
[1:17:41] with. And the whole point of being
[1:17:43] reborn is so that this this new birth
[1:17:46] can come to a growth and a stage and
[1:17:49] immaturity where it can dominate the
[1:17:51] other one.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; That's the victory.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. So you say but I make such
[1:17:58] terrible mistakes within yourself. It is
[1:18:01] your old nature under the effects of the
[1:18:04] Holy Ghost thinks that it is part of the
[1:18:06] promise. It's your flesh that feels it
[1:18:09] has something. So when you get that
[1:18:11] beautiful feeling of being born again,
[1:18:13] you know who benefits first? The older
[1:18:16] twin.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; He's the one who feels the excitement.
[1:18:19] He is the one who wants to duplicate the
[1:18:22] excitement. He's the one who wants to
[1:18:24] tell you we need to have this experience
[1:18:26] forever and forever and forever. He's
[1:18:28] the one who's who's going to be trying
[1:18:31] to interpret things. But the other one
[1:18:33] just knows
[1:18:35] I know who my father is.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's all I know right now. I can't
[1:18:40] explain everything, but I know who my
[1:18:42] father is.
[1:18:44] Amen. And that's the only thing that's
[1:18:46] going to hold you.
[1:18:52] It's so that older twin, its end is
[1:18:56] going to be the rapture. Why? We know
[1:19:00] this body will be dissolved.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a new one waiting for
[1:19:04] us. So that older twin will come to its
[1:19:06] end in the rapture. The body is
[1:19:08] dissolved. The old nature is put away.
[1:19:10] Your new nature within you which has
[1:19:12] been born. It is no longer just a seed,
[1:19:15] an attribute like it was inside mama.
[1:19:18] But now it's living. Now it's
[1:19:20] manifesting. Now it's dealing with
[1:19:22] challenges. It's learning to walk. It's
[1:19:25] it's crawling. It's walking. It's
[1:19:27] standing. It's falling. It's it's
[1:19:29] growing. Right? It's now living. It's
[1:19:33] it's in you. It's it's an infant form.
[1:19:35] It's a baby. Notice your old nature
[1:19:38] being the old twin will always get its
[1:19:41] way most of the time
[1:19:44] after you were born again. Your old
[1:19:46] nature is still going to get its way
[1:19:48] most of the time
[1:19:50] because you're still not grown up yet.
[1:19:52] You just been born again. What do you
[1:19:54] expect?
[1:19:56] And that's the other thing when you know
[1:19:58] uh this is a very human thing.
[1:20:02] Somebody has an experience
[1:20:04] uh you know they come to church they
[1:20:06] have this full-blown experience in the
[1:20:09] presence of the Lord it's a real genuine
[1:20:12] repentance birthing messy they have this
[1:20:15] experience they come forward they have
[1:20:16] prayer and then a few weeks later you
[1:20:19] know it's like human pe humans once you
[1:20:23] once they see you had the experience
[1:20:24] they expect you to be 100%
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; like from from there on now the person
[1:20:30] makes a mistake and you say And there's
[1:20:32] people talking and saying, "You see that
[1:20:33] experience?" And and it's like when you
[1:20:36] tell a child, I thought you said you had
[1:20:39] this experience. Now look what you did.
[1:20:42] Like what do you mean? Can I not make a
[1:20:44] mistake?
[1:20:46] Can I not have a bad day?
[1:20:49] Of course you can. You can have that
[1:20:51] experience in the presence of the Lord.
[1:20:53] You can feel born again. You can feel um
[1:20:56] that revelation come down on you and
[1:20:58] still you can make a mistake. still you
[1:21:00] can have a bad day. That's right.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; And it's why it's the older one, not
[1:21:06] you.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to come to that personal
[1:21:09] understanding. I'm not going to be here
[1:21:11] to make you feel good. Say, "Don't
[1:21:13] worry, brother. It's not you." Yes, you
[1:21:17] still have to account for it because
[1:21:19] your body did it, right? You're going to
[1:21:22] have to account for it, but you've got
[1:21:24] to know who your father is.
[1:21:26] That revelation is the only one that can
[1:21:29] hold you during every trial of
[1:21:32] backslideness.
[1:21:35] Is there scripture? Well, of course
[1:21:36] there is. What was the only thing that
[1:21:40] prodigal son who wasted all his ex all
[1:21:44] his existence all his inheritance
[1:21:47] sitting among the pigs? What is the one
[1:21:49] thing he said? I have a father.
[1:21:54] Nothing else could redeem him at that
[1:21:57] point.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; I have a father.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; That's the only revelation that holds
[1:22:03] you in a new birth.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; That's the only time you're getting
[1:22:07] identity.
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; That's what identity, that's what the
[1:22:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost is about. It's
[1:22:14] supposed to bring to you identity.
[1:22:16] Identity of mom, identity of dad, and
[1:22:19] it's drawing you towards your own
[1:22:22] identity. You still don't know who you
[1:22:23] are yet. This guy's sitting in a pig pen
[1:22:27] sitting among all the filth. All he
[1:22:29] knows is I have a father.
[1:22:33] He still doesn't know who he is yet.
[1:22:36] He's called a prodigal son.
[1:22:40] Now he's got to go and take his place.
[1:22:42] When he goes back to the father, when he
[1:22:44] comes back to the father, that's when
[1:22:46] the father says, "Put on him my robe.
[1:22:49] Put on him my ring. kill the fatted
[1:22:51] calf. Now the father is giving him his
[1:22:54] identity.
[1:22:56] That's where we come to conversion.
[1:22:59] Can you see? Up to this point, you
[1:23:03] thought you were converted.
[1:23:05] Why? Just cuz you you you you done well
[1:23:08] at dressing weirdly,
[1:23:10] huh? You thought you were converted.
[1:23:13] Just because you came to a message
[1:23:15] church, you sing different songs. You
[1:23:17] thought you were converted.
[1:23:19] No, you were probably just begotten
[1:23:23] and then you were born again and you're
[1:23:26] still not converted.
[1:23:30] Let's read Acts chapter 3. Let's go to
[1:23:31] converted.
[1:23:33] I think I put a nice picture there for
[1:23:35] converted.
[1:23:37] Hey, think about that a little while.
[1:23:40] But what converted is prior to that was
[1:23:43] everyone else helping you.
[1:23:48] Acts 3:1 19
[1:23:50] Repent you therefore and be converted
[1:23:53] that your sins may be blotted out
[1:23:59] when the times of refreshing shall come
[1:24:01] from the presence of the Lord.
[1:24:03] Now you Bible readers with the spirit of
[1:24:06] wisdom and revelation
[1:24:08] I'm calling on you. The process of
[1:24:11] conversion takes place after the birth.
[1:24:16] You thought you were converted when you
[1:24:18] came to the church when you chose the
[1:24:21] message.
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; I want to point out here that this is
[1:24:26] the only stage the scripture indicates
[1:24:29] blotting out of sins.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Be converted that your sins be blotted
[1:24:38] out.
[1:24:40] You want your sins blotted out when
[1:24:42] you're begotten. You want your sins
[1:24:44] blotted out when you're born again.
[1:24:46] You're your sins are only blotted out
[1:24:48] when you're converted.
[1:24:50] Glory to God
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; in the conversion stage. Why? How is
[1:24:56] that so? See, that's the thing. That's
[1:24:58] why I said when I preached the other
[1:24:59] week, it's like, brother Al, the the
[1:25:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I need the
[1:25:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost so I can get
[1:25:05] rid of these bad things. I'm sorry.
[1:25:07] That's not how it works.
[1:25:10] Trust me, you just get rid of those bad
[1:25:11] things and there's more bad things
[1:25:13] coming up.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; You know what?
[1:25:17] You thought you were bad.
[1:25:21] You just didn't realize how bad
[1:25:24] you were. Except a whole lot of things
[1:25:27] from your family genes still inside
[1:25:30] waiting to pop out.
[1:25:32] And the only thing that can expose those
[1:25:34] things is the word.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, just when you thought I
[1:25:38] gave up drinking, I gave up smoking. And
[1:25:41] you know what? You didn't realize you
[1:25:44] could be a thief,
[1:25:47] a cheat,
[1:25:48] a liar. Those things were still stuck
[1:25:51] inside. They still have to come out.
[1:25:54] They still have to be exposed.
[1:25:57] A backbiter, a gossip.
[1:26:00] Nothing better than putting you in a
[1:26:02] church to prove you're a gossip.
[1:26:07] Uh, someone who could kill your
[1:26:09] brother's testimony. You never thought
[1:26:11] you could do that. A murderer.
[1:26:14] Huh?
[1:26:16] And all you thought was, "I was a
[1:26:18] smoker. Praise the Lord. I got
[1:26:20] deliverance the day I got baptized and I
[1:26:22] was born again."
[1:26:24] Yeah. So funny.
[1:26:26] You're still learning how bad it
[1:26:29] actually was. How bad those sinful
[1:26:32] natures are. It's going to be drawn out
[1:26:34] of you. It's going to be exposed. Why?
[1:26:37] You You have to be rewritten.
[1:26:39] You have to be converted.
[1:26:43] Amen.
[1:26:45] Now, here's the other question. Where is
[1:26:47] it blotted out? Where are your sins
[1:26:49] blotted out from?
[1:26:53] I'm I'm so glad we spoke about it on
[1:26:55] Wednesday. You know, like I was telling
[1:26:57] you, God doesn't have give himself a
[1:26:59] memory wipe, you know,
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; where he he forgets everything. Just
[1:27:04] wipes it out. Oh, look at my son. I
[1:27:05] totally forgot what he did last week.
[1:27:08] All those bad things. No. What? What bad
[1:27:11] things? I can't remember. It's in the
[1:27:13] sea of my forgetfulness. I'm the kind of
[1:27:16] God that can just forget things.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; No, it's not blotting it out from his
[1:27:21] mind. It's blotting it out from your
[1:27:24] mind.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Nothing. Not begotten. Not baptism of
[1:27:30] the Holy Ghost is going to blot it out
[1:27:31] from your life and your mind. Only
[1:27:33] conversion
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; does that.
[1:27:38] Conversion blotss it up. So be converted
[1:27:42] that your sins be blotted out.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; See, think of it carefully. If you are a
[1:27:48] changed new person, what happens when
[1:27:51] you are a changed person? You make new
[1:27:54] memories. You make new experiences for
[1:27:57] you and for people. So put it this way.
[1:28:01] You done wrong things. You were a
[1:28:02] sinner. You were an awful person.
[1:28:04] Whatever. You came into the message
[1:28:06] church. You had a Holy Ghost experience.
[1:28:08] And still people don't know what you can
[1:28:10] do.
[1:28:12] The only thing they know is what you
[1:28:14] did.
[1:28:16] It's still not blotted out. All they're
[1:28:18] doing is, "Oh yes, we you know this
[1:28:20] brother, he used to be this and this,
[1:28:21] but God has saved him." That's all they
[1:28:23] know. You're still nothing.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; You're still the person who has their
[1:28:27] testimony. Do you have a new testimony?
[1:28:32] No. So the only way the Old Testament
[1:28:34] gets blotted out is if there's a New
[1:28:36] Testament.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; The New Testament blotss out the Old
[1:28:39] Testament.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; So it then has to be what you do, your
[1:28:45] identity that blotss out your sin.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; And this is a problem with church. And
[1:28:51] to me, message churches have this
[1:28:54] problem.
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; This is the problem. You go all around
[1:28:58] the world today. This is a message
[1:29:01] problem.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; What is it? Sitting around and doing
[1:29:05] nothing.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Come to church, listen to the pastor, go
[1:29:11] back home and do nothing else.
[1:29:16] No other identity. What do you do? Who
[1:29:20] are you besides a message church goer?
[1:29:24] Who are you?
[1:29:27] How do we come to the end of our lives
[1:29:29] and stand next to Paul who traveled to
[1:29:33] three cities a day to preach and say,
[1:29:36] "We're brothers.
[1:29:38] We did good for the kingdom of God. You
[1:29:41] toiled. You labored. You went on
[1:29:42] horseback and camel. You got thrown in
[1:29:44] prison. Me I sat at home and read the
[1:29:47] books.
[1:29:51] I came to church. I listened to brother
[1:29:53] Al. I made sure I amen him. I was his
[1:29:56] amen corner.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; That is what I did for the kingdom.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, I came to church. I grew up my
[1:30:05] children. I put them to school. I taught
[1:30:07] them good values. That's my purpose.
[1:30:12] This is a message church problem.
[1:30:16] This is stagnation. This is why you end
[1:30:18] up with people who are confused about
[1:30:20] their experience. This is why you you
[1:30:23] you you end up with people who don't
[1:30:25] know and then when when time goes by and
[1:30:28] you're sitting around doing nothing with
[1:30:30] yourself. Um you don't know what to do.
[1:30:34] So there's no identity. Well, no wonder
[1:30:37] people are never forgetting the wrong
[1:30:39] things you did
[1:30:41] because you're not doing any new things.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; We're in this conversion stage and it's
[1:30:50] about to get real.
[1:30:51] [Music]
[1:30:52] Right now, it's about to get real. You
[1:30:54] know what's happening? We've been
[1:30:55] sitting around. God has been throwing
[1:30:57] war here, war there, economic stress,
[1:31:00] famine here, flood here, earthquake
[1:31:01] there, volcano there, tsunami there. All
[1:31:04] those things happening. And we're still
[1:31:06] sitting, waiting. Because this message
[1:31:09] mindset is we must just read the
[1:31:11] message, listen to tapes, come to
[1:31:13] church, and wait for the rapture.
[1:31:17] You're a whole bunch of people who have
[1:31:18] been begotten and born and no
[1:31:20] conversion.
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Everything is about me, me, me, help me.
[1:31:26] Let me draw. The the experience is when
[1:31:28] the church doesn't help me. What are you
[1:31:31] doing? You're still a baby. When the
[1:31:33] church doesn't do when they don't call
[1:31:35] me, when they don't visit me, you're
[1:31:37] already telling me you're a child.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; You're a child.
[1:31:45] This is when your new nature starts
[1:31:47] dominating the old. The conversion
[1:31:49] state, the process of conversion is when
[1:31:53] you start taking responsibility for your
[1:31:55] life and say the gene seed in me is
[1:31:59] strong.
[1:32:01] Now I am controlling that other guy.
[1:32:04] We reach level ground. Now I'm growing.
[1:32:08] the word, the mysteries are being
[1:32:10] revealed and I'm growing. Now, I'm not I
[1:32:15] know it was it was harsh a few minutes
[1:32:17] ago.
[1:32:18] I would say that it was meant to be that
[1:32:20] way for a while because this was the
[1:32:23] only stage where the mysteries could be
[1:32:25] revealed,
[1:32:26] right? And we had to wait for the
[1:32:28] mysteries to be revealed. Unfortunately,
[1:32:31] we got stuck in this place of waiting.
[1:32:34] Now that the mysteries are being
[1:32:36] revealed, there needs to be your
[1:32:39] identity coming in. We know father's
[1:32:42] identity. We know mother's identity,
[1:32:44] right? And mother's a true mother, a
[1:32:48] true father is going to start kicking
[1:32:50] you out the nest.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; This is the thing. This idea of churches
[1:32:57] pampering people, I can't stand it.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; That's like you want to keep them
[1:33:02] babies. You want to keep them loyal.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; You have no idea how bad it is. You know
[1:33:10] I
[1:33:12] some things I don't even think about
[1:33:14] like you know what hear some brothers
[1:33:16] say no no no you must take up the
[1:33:18] offerings after the preaching of the
[1:33:20] word because that's what all the people
[1:33:21] I hear.
[1:33:23] If you take it during the song service
[1:33:25] some people and some people only come
[1:33:27] after the offering has been taken.
[1:33:31] I I never think like that. And then I
[1:33:34] think what?
[1:33:37] Why would you even think like that? And
[1:33:39] then I didn't realize they even make
[1:33:41] these rules. If you love God, you'll be
[1:33:42] there half an hour before the service
[1:33:44] and you have quiet time before. What is
[1:33:46] all that for? Make sure you've got full
[1:33:48] church before the the offering is taken.
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; It's unbelievable.
[1:33:54] And you want to keep your babies,
[1:33:57] you know, keep you there, keep you
[1:33:59] supporting them. That's a mother who
[1:34:02] can't let go.
[1:34:05] That's a problem. A mother who can't let
[1:34:07] go is a problem because a child is not
[1:34:10] getting his own identity.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; And that's why a father has to step in
[1:34:15] and say, "Listen, let him go bang his
[1:34:18] head. Let him go make his mistake. Yeah,
[1:34:21] he'll come back. Oh, mama, this what
[1:34:24] she'll." But with me, go do it. It's
[1:34:28] your choice. Yeah,
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; you've got to learn from it.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; I've got to give you your own identity.
[1:34:34] You've got to know how to deal with it
[1:34:35] your way by my advice.
[1:34:40] See, and this is the problem. This is
[1:34:42] what I find the issue right now when I
[1:34:45] say there's a shift in the message.
[1:34:47] We've really have to shift people from
[1:34:50] this place of babbing them. We've got to
[1:34:52] put the power in their hands. We've got
[1:34:54] to respect their free will. That's
[1:34:56] right.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; We've got to realize we've got to even
[1:34:58] let our people go into serious trouble
[1:35:02] where they messed their lives up and
[1:35:05] respect their free will choice and know
[1:35:07] that if they are God's child, they'll
[1:35:09] come back.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; You can't control them. You can't keep
[1:35:14] them as a baby crawling baby forever.
[1:35:18] The first sign of the biggest enemy,
[1:35:20] they will die
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; cuz they got no experience. This is the
[1:35:24] problem with teenagers in the message
[1:35:26] today. What do we do? Keep them as
[1:35:28] babies, right? Look at what they did
[1:35:31] with the courtship and dating.
[1:35:33] You brought up with all these message
[1:35:35] youth, you know, who just stand outside
[1:35:37] church and don't talk.
[1:35:40] Nobody's allowed to approach you. Nobody
[1:35:43] flirts with you. They come to you. They
[1:35:45] stand, you talk, the brother stands, the
[1:35:47] sister comes. God bless you, sister.
[1:35:51] The teenager, 16, 17. God bless you,
[1:35:54] sister. You know, and quotes the
[1:35:57] message. Look at me. I'm not mocking
[1:35:59] this. I'm telling you what's going to
[1:36:00] happen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Then this child goes to university and
[1:36:03] meets a beautiful
[1:36:07] girl dressed like the world. She's not
[1:36:10] going to stand there and, you know, uh,
[1:36:13] come and ask him about the message.
[1:36:16] Those girls out in the in university
[1:36:18] will just kiss you for fun.
[1:36:20] like you'll never even see it coming.
[1:36:23] You'll be sitting in a cafeteria uh
[1:36:26] doing your work and someone wouldn't
[1:36:27] come and sit on your lap. This is not
[1:36:30] message kids. Now you're at school,
[1:36:33] you're meeting a and you don't know how
[1:36:35] to deal with it because in your own home
[1:36:37] you are never even allowed to deal with
[1:36:40] it.
[1:36:43] They made you act like it's sinful like
[1:36:45] it's like so the the youth couldn't even
[1:36:48] talk to each other on the basis of being
[1:36:50] normal boys and girls to be flirted with
[1:36:54] to deal with flirting to deal with
[1:36:55] rejection. You know what happens to our
[1:36:57] message boys the first time they are
[1:36:58] rejected by a girl they act like the
[1:37:01] biggest babies you've ever seen on the
[1:37:02] planet. Life is over. They're dead.
[1:37:05] They're ready for death
[1:37:07] because it's the first time they've been
[1:37:09] rejected.
[1:37:14] These are the guys supposed to go in the
[1:37:16] rapture. These are the guys who supposed
[1:37:18] to be standing with Samson and David.
[1:37:22] One girl rejects him and they can't even
[1:37:24] hold a sword.
[1:37:27] You're depressed. You're broken. You're
[1:37:29] ready to give up on God. You're ready to
[1:37:32] end everything just cuz a girl rejected
[1:37:35] you. You haven't been rejected enough.
[1:37:37] That's your problem. Mommy's been
[1:37:38] treating you like you're the the be the
[1:37:40] next best thing to God.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Mommy's been treating you're a gold.
[1:37:45] You're a jewel in the crown. You're
[1:37:47] saved. You got the Holy Ghost. You're
[1:37:49] perfect. You're my You got the best
[1:37:52] hairstyle. You're the brightest kid on
[1:37:54] the block. Rejected one time and you're
[1:37:57] done for. That's what we're getting
[1:37:59] right now. Young girls, you grew up in
[1:38:01] this cocoon with this message uh
[1:38:04] community. Perfect,
[1:38:08] right? You you you're brought up with
[1:38:09] all these gentlemanly figures in the
[1:38:12] church. Sister so and so. Sister so and
[1:38:14] so. You get out there to all those
[1:38:16] fellas who come up there with their
[1:38:18] pickup lines and their cars and their
[1:38:20] gel back hair and their uh watchers and
[1:38:23] their whatever they have to give you and
[1:38:25] you you're sunk.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; First smooth talking coyote
[1:38:32] and you're gone. You're sunk. You got
[1:38:35] not not enough Holy Ghost to give you
[1:38:37] common sense. You're done for.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Because parenting.
[1:38:46] This is a message thing.
[1:38:50] I look at people out there in the world.
[1:38:52] Some of them go through like three or
[1:38:54] four girlfriends. Eventually they've
[1:38:55] been wrecked. Then they go choose
[1:38:57] someone and of course they get married
[1:38:59] and they make a life together. They
[1:39:01] become successful. Yes. They fight, they
[1:39:04] drink, they do all the stuff that normal
[1:39:06] people do and they but they'll make
[1:39:08] their life or educate their kids or go
[1:39:10] to school. They'll have fake holidays on
[1:39:12] Facebook. Yeah. So what they do all
[1:39:15] that, right? And uh but they'll actually
[1:39:18] get their life together. No. message.
[1:39:21] People who've never been used to
[1:39:23] rejection, who never been used to to
[1:39:26] making their own decisions cannot
[1:39:29] survive when they're arguing with
[1:39:31] husband and wife. Like life is over.
[1:39:35] They cannot survive. Life can't
[1:39:38] function. They can't go to work. They
[1:39:40] can't even deal with an argument. They
[1:39:41] can't deal with conflict.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; You're fighting with a family, normal
[1:39:46] family arguments and feuds. You just
[1:39:48] can't deal with it. It's so pathetic.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And the whole world goes through it. But
[1:39:55] you're acting like you're collapsing on
[1:39:56] the floor like jelly and custard.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; It is so annoying.
[1:40:07] Oh, tell you just counsel people long
[1:40:10] enough and I tell you you you're ready
[1:40:13] to leave the room because you're asking
[1:40:15] yourself, have I been preaching so long
[1:40:18] on the mysteries of the kingdom only to
[1:40:20] have this
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; h?
[1:40:26] And don't let me get started with
[1:40:28] ministers.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; Ministers are the worst who cannot
[1:40:32] forgive one another.
[1:40:35] If you can't forgive another minister,
[1:40:37] how are you teaching your church to
[1:40:38] forgive each other?
[1:40:41] If if you can't be a brother to someone
[1:40:43] who hates you, how can you teach your
[1:40:46] child to do that? You're a hypocrite.
[1:40:50] If you if if you choose to have circles
[1:40:52] of ministers you agree with, people you
[1:40:55] get together with, people you have camps
[1:40:57] with, people you associate with, and you
[1:40:59] can't even associate with everybody like
[1:41:02] the prophet did.
[1:41:05] It's hypocrisy.
[1:41:06] It's immaturity. You haven't even come
[1:41:09] to conversion yet.
[1:41:13] You might just have been born.
[1:41:17] Listen, this is real. This is real
[1:41:19] experience. This is what's going on
[1:41:21] right now. So it is time for conversion
[1:41:25] for the the younger
[1:41:28] to be dominating the elder. And the
[1:41:31] elder should be serving the younger. We
[1:41:33] shouldn't be giving way for the elder to
[1:41:35] dominate.
[1:41:38] Think about it. You were once a person
[1:41:40] being ruled by the thinking of the
[1:41:42] world, the old nature, but now you're
[1:41:44] becoming a person guided by the thinking
[1:41:45] of the new nature. Let's read Romans 9
[1:41:49] 11. For the children being not born,
[1:41:51] neither having done any good or evil,
[1:41:53] the purpose of God according to election
[1:41:55] might stand, not of works, but of him
[1:41:56] that calleth. It was said unto her, "The
[1:41:58] elder shall serve the younger." As it is
[1:42:00] written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau
[1:42:02] have I hated.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; See, the elder shall serve the younger.
[1:42:06] That's the prophecy. This is that that
[1:42:09] prophecy exists
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; to tell us that there must come a time
[1:42:14] where this old nature
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; must succumb to the new nature.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; That new n there must be a conversion.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; That is the rest of your journey.
[1:42:25] Conversion is about the old nature
[1:42:28] serving the new nature, the elder
[1:42:30] serving the younger, the flesh to serve
[1:42:32] the purpose of the soul. It's the rest
[1:42:34] of your journey. You don't stop at being
[1:42:37] born again.
[1:42:41] But in modern Christianity, conversion
[1:42:44] is seen as just becoming a Christian.
[1:42:46] Converting from a sinner to a Christian.
[1:42:48] That is a changing that is changing
[1:42:50] religion. You can change a religion. It
[1:42:53] doesn't mean you're converted.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; It's not conversion. Let's read Israel
[1:42:57] and the church. Let's let's go through
[1:42:59] this quick. And he received the purpose
[1:43:01] before he was circumcised. Romans 4 will
[1:43:03] tell you. He received the promise before
[1:43:05] he was circumcised. Then he uh this is
[1:43:07] part of 11:18. Then he was given
[1:43:09] circumcision as a seal of his obedience
[1:43:11] of faith.
[1:43:13] Uh now when we say that why Billy
[1:43:16] Graham, Charles Philip, Billings and all
[1:43:18] of them why they're talking about them
[1:43:19] Baptist brethren I told you many of them
[1:43:21] Rufus Mosley and the whole bunch. He
[1:43:23] said well we have 20,000 converts in two
[1:43:26] weeks. They couldn't find 20 people.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; I said well they wasn't converted.
[1:43:32] Yeah.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, he said they accepted Christ as
[1:43:34] personal savior. I said still they're
[1:43:36] not converted.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; You're converted. To convert means to be
[1:43:40] changed.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; 121 Peter had believed on the Lord. He
[1:43:45] had been baptized, been given power to
[1:43:47] heal the sick, cast out devils, raised
[1:43:49] the dead. Jesus told him the night
[1:43:50] before the crucifixion, after you're
[1:43:53] converted, strengthen your brother.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Been both saved, sanctified, and hadn't
[1:43:59] been converted.
[1:44:01] Notice saved, sanctified, and not
[1:44:04] converted.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; Let's go to approach to God. So what is
[1:44:09] converted?
[1:44:11] When God come down hunting for the man,
[1:44:13] there it is. See, God come down hunting
[1:44:15] for you.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this. It's always
[1:44:18] God hunting the man, not man hunting
[1:44:20] God. See, I told you
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; he said that.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Did you ever think of that? that no man
[1:44:25] at any time or any age ever did within
[1:44:28] himself desired to serve God. Never has
[1:44:31] been. His nature's against it. That
[1:44:34] feeling you had of you hunting God was
[1:44:36] because God found you.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Now he might have had some kind of an
[1:44:42] intellectual thoughts. He thinks that he
[1:44:44] does believe God. But when he actually
[1:44:47] really believes God, he becomes
[1:44:49] converted a new creature. As soon as he
[1:44:52] believes God, that means you can be
[1:44:55] begotten. And I just proved to you, you
[1:44:58] are begotten and you don't know mom and
[1:44:59] dad. You still don't believe God.
[1:45:04] Yet you know about the message. You know
[1:45:05] about William Brandon. You know about
[1:45:06] the message church. You're in the
[1:45:08] message church. You still don't believe
[1:45:10] God. You maybe you came under message
[1:45:13] parish. This is my my experience. born
[1:45:17] in a pastor's house, living the life,
[1:45:19] playing the music, baptized, and still
[1:45:23] don't know God.
[1:45:26] When you really believe God, becomes
[1:45:29] converted, a new creature. As soon as he
[1:45:30] believes God, he may be intellectually
[1:45:33] believing God. But when he believes from
[1:45:35] his heart, then he is converted. Becomes
[1:45:38] a member of the body of Christ. When
[1:45:40] he's converted from his heart, not from
[1:45:42] his intellects. Amen. We spoke about
[1:45:45] sanctification. We told you it was not
[1:45:48] revelation. You don't need revelation to
[1:45:50] be sanctified. You just need to stop
[1:45:52] doing the bad things and start doing
[1:45:54] good things.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; That's sanctifying yourself. Right? In
[1:45:59] justification and sanctification, you
[1:46:01] are still concerned with self.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Begotten and born. You're still
[1:46:08] concerned with self.
[1:46:10] What mommy can do for me? What the
[1:46:13] church can do for me. Yes. Yes.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; What daddy can do for me?
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; God help me. Pray for me. Pray for me.
[1:46:19] Lay hands on me. Help me with this. Help
[1:46:22] me with that.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; Those first two stages is what someone
[1:46:26] else can do for you. You are still
[1:46:27] concerned with self.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; What is conversion? After you are
[1:46:32] converted, strengthen your brethren.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Thirsting for life. Did you ever read
[1:46:39] such words? How my soul long for thee in
[1:46:41] a thirsty land where no water is. This
[1:46:43] is rather an unusual text. But God is
[1:46:45] unusual. God does unusual things. He
[1:46:48] works in mysterious ways. He's wonders
[1:46:49] to perform. And we're living in an
[1:46:51] unusual day in an unusual time. But
[1:46:53] we're serving the God has been in all
[1:46:55] times. And when I thought of this, you
[1:46:57] know, my soul does for thee. If your
[1:46:59] soul is what directs you, it's what
[1:47:01] makes you what you are. A soul is the
[1:47:04] nature of the spirit. And when a man is
[1:47:05] converted, he doesn't get another
[1:47:08] spirit. He gets a spirit change.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; A conversion means to change his
[1:47:13] thinking.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; Change his way of living and so forth.
[1:47:16] So my souls, this is what I tell you.
[1:47:19] You can be a messed child. You can grow
[1:47:21] up in the word. You can live perfectly
[1:47:23] just like I did. Don't go make mistakes.
[1:47:25] Don't drink. Don't smoke. Don't
[1:47:27] fornicate. Don't do anything. Just live
[1:47:29] in the church. Right? And then you get
[1:47:31] to university and you come back and you
[1:47:33] start questioning God. You start
[1:47:35] questioning the Bible, questioning the
[1:47:37] message. You have questions on politics
[1:47:40] and abortion and LGBTQ and all this
[1:47:43] stuff. All it's telling me is you
[1:47:45] haven't been converted yet.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; You've been thinking about it. You've
[1:47:50] been intellectually believe. But when
[1:47:52] you believe God, there is a rock inside.
[1:47:56] No matter what this world gives you,
[1:47:58] there's my rock.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; That's what I believe. I may not be able
[1:48:02] to explain everything, but that's what I
[1:48:04] believe.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when you have started to be
[1:48:07] converted.
[1:48:10] Come to that stage and everything else
[1:48:12] falls away. You no longer have this
[1:48:14] thing about what you can do for me, what
[1:48:16] the church can do for me. You'll be
[1:48:18] brother Al. What can I do for for the
[1:48:20] church? What can I do for the brothers?
[1:48:22] What can I do for this situation? That's
[1:48:24] a person who's been converted
[1:48:28] and truly converted. Because anybody who
[1:48:31] has some kind of OCD will be asking,
[1:48:33] "What can I do?
[1:48:36] That doesn't mean you're converted.
[1:48:40] Unfailing realities of the living God.
[1:48:43] Some of them in the OCD just don't even
[1:48:45] ask. They just do.
[1:48:48] You know, that's not straight. That's
[1:48:49] not in place.
[1:48:51] Church should be this way. Shouldn't be
[1:48:53] that way. Nobody asked you.
[1:48:59] Just leave me as is. You know, I'm okay
[1:49:01] with that.
[1:49:03] But it gets to the place where you start
[1:49:06] getting revelation. You get an identity
[1:49:09] and the identity when God reveals to you
[1:49:11] what your strength is and your purpose
[1:49:13] is for the body. That's when you start
[1:49:16] strengthening your brethren. Amen.
[1:49:17] Unfailing reality to the living God. The
[1:49:20] Holy Spirit comes today in a manner like
[1:49:21] to to present I love this. The Holy
[1:49:25] Spirit comes today in like manner to
[1:49:27] present God to man.
[1:49:32] If there's anything that should be the
[1:49:35] evidence of the Holy Spirit,
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; is God being presented to me.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; But man wants to go to church. See that?
[1:49:45] Those fellas still want to live with
[1:49:46] their mommy.
[1:49:52] Not too many amens. That's okay.
[1:49:56] You have to let go. Yeah,
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; you have to realize you have a purpose
[1:50:01] outside of mommy,
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; outside of the church. You'll always
[1:50:05] have the church to run back to so it can
[1:50:06] soo you when you're crying. But you
[1:50:09] know, you have to have a purpose beyond
[1:50:12] parents. That's where we are coming to.
[1:50:15] We must learn that God is not known by
[1:50:18] intellectual conception. I'm reading God
[1:50:20] is known by the new birth, by the Holy
[1:50:22] Ghost, not by other way. Jesus. The
[1:50:25] Bible is plainly quoted. No man can call
[1:50:28] Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:29] And if you So it means you only get
[1:50:32] connected to father when you receive the
[1:50:34] Holy Ghost. That's when you start. You
[1:50:37] can be born
[1:50:39] born and you see mommy. But when is the
[1:50:42] time when you recognize daddy as daddy?
[1:50:46] You got to receive his spirit, his
[1:50:48] anointing. He's got to spend time with
[1:50:51] you. Yeah,
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; you got to spend time with him.
[1:50:57] You know, uh most of the time you just
[1:51:00] any mother and father ju you you just
[1:51:03] have a new baby and uh the baby
[1:51:06] immediately bonds with mommy
[1:51:09] and uh baby doesn't know anything about
[1:51:11] what you're doing and most of the time
[1:51:14] she's feeding the baby and you come
[1:51:16] there and you try to pick up baby and
[1:51:17] the baby cries. It doesn't even know
[1:51:19] you. That's why
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; who are you? Go away. You know, and then
[1:51:24] and when it's feeding time or sleep
[1:51:25] time, they treat you like dirt.
[1:51:28] You're the father. You've been slogging
[1:51:29] all day. You've been helping wipe
[1:51:32] nappies and you've been going getting
[1:51:34] the food. Mom is just taking care of Oh,
[1:51:36] she's cooing with you, bing with you,
[1:51:38] enjoying your new play.
[1:51:41] And she and you're bonding with her.
[1:51:43] Poor fellow comes back from work
[1:51:45] sweating and whatever. And the baby just
[1:51:47] doesn't want to know you.
[1:51:50] That's fine. I told my wife, I said,
[1:51:52] "You got them until they're teenagers.
[1:51:54] After that, they're mine. I'm okay. I'm
[1:51:58] not insecure. I don't need them to love
[1:52:00] me when they're babies. But when they're
[1:52:02] teenagers, I'm going to whoop them into
[1:52:03] shape. That's for sure."
[1:52:06] If you never receive the Holy Ghost, you
[1:52:08] don't know that he is Christ.
[1:52:11] You cannot know his identity. You cannot
[1:52:14] know father unless you receive the Holy
[1:52:16] Ghost.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Glory. So what is the Holy Ghost for?
[1:52:20] It's presenting God to man. It's giving
[1:52:24] you identity of who your father is.
[1:52:26] You're going to start learning who he
[1:52:28] is. But that's not the end. The end is
[1:52:31] knowing who you are.
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; Even if you know father, you're not
[1:52:37] converted.
[1:52:39] You're not converted until you receive
[1:52:41] the Holy Ghost. The Bible said after
[1:52:43] Peter had been saved and sanctified and
[1:52:45] given power. So you have to receive the
[1:52:48] Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost comes
[1:52:50] because father's identity gives you your
[1:52:54] identity.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; See and Peter so do you understand?
[1:53:01] Huh? Not completely.
[1:53:04] See this is the problem with message
[1:53:06] churches because you develop develop a
[1:53:09] message church identity
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; that's not father's identity
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; and that church identity does not give
[1:53:19] you your new name
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; so after Peter had been saved and
[1:53:26] sanctified give power to cast unclean
[1:53:27] spirits to preach the gospel Jesus
[1:53:30] plainly told him he was not converted
[1:53:33] until received the Holy Ghost. And he
[1:53:35] said, "After you're converted,
[1:53:36] strengthen your brethren." That was on
[1:53:39] the night of the betrayal. So saints,
[1:53:41] it's so easy to confuse this. What Holy
[1:53:43] Ghost? Uh what is the Holy Ghost? The
[1:53:46] Peter had already received gifts of the
[1:53:48] Holy Ghost before before Christ
[1:53:50] ascended, right? Peter was went out
[1:53:53] praying for the sick, casting out
[1:53:54] devils. We know that. You mean even with
[1:53:57] that, he didn't know who he was?
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. because then he denied him.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Three times.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; But after Acts chapter 2,
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; That same guy who was stuttering and
[1:54:14] failing and denying the Lord and running
[1:54:16] back to fishing naked now stands there
[1:54:20] openly saying, "What? Don't you know
[1:54:23] what this is? This is that which the
[1:54:25] prophet Joel prophesied of."
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:29] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. He became someone with
[1:54:32] identity. He said, "Silver and gold have
[1:54:35] I none, but such as I have."
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Give I thee.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; This doesn't mean it is the same for
[1:54:45] everyone. Peter's conception, birth,
[1:54:48] conversion happened at a very different
[1:54:51] pace compared with Paul. So what I'm
[1:54:54] saying is you'll have some people
[1:54:55] they'll be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:54:58] They'll start receiving identity from
[1:54:59] the next day. Why? There's a fire lit
[1:55:01] under them. They're traveling to Russia
[1:55:03] to spread the gospel.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; You still sitting at home. It happens at
[1:55:07] a totally different pace. There was
[1:55:09] Peter. What happened with Paul? Paul
[1:55:12] meets the purifier. He has his
[1:55:14] conception at Damascus. He has his new
[1:55:17] birth. He has to wait for his new birth.
[1:55:18] He's blind. He goes to Ananas. Ananas
[1:55:21] gets a message from the Holy Ghost
[1:55:23] telling him Paul is coming. He says to
[1:55:25] Ananas, you will pray for Paul. Paul
[1:55:27] will receive his sight. Then he will
[1:55:29] receive the Holy Ghost. He receives the
[1:55:31] new birth. When Ananas prays for him and
[1:55:33] his blindness is gone. Then brother
[1:55:35] Baron says Paul goes to Egypt for 3
[1:55:37] years.
[1:55:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; To study the word to get all the other
[1:55:42] stuff out of him and come back. And then
[1:55:44] he comes back and he confronts Peter and
[1:55:46] James and all them and he says to them,
[1:55:48] "Uh, you're doing this wrong.
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be doing this.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't the gospel of Christ uh supposed
[1:55:57] to be Jews and Gentiles? No male, no
[1:55:59] female. No, this why are you separating
[1:56:02] them? Why are you bringing back your
[1:56:03] This guy who came from
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; he's got he's getting identity. Yes,
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; he had to still go through his
[1:56:10] conversion completely different pace.
[1:56:12] And then he comes out and identifies
[1:56:15] himself as the apostle to the Gentiles.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[1:56:19] &gt;&gt; Like the other believers would be like,
[1:56:21] "What a nerve."
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Who does he think he is? He wasn't even
[1:56:24] there in the upper room. He wasn't even
[1:56:26] there with the prophet.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't see what we see. He wasn't
[1:56:30] even in the meetings.
[1:56:34] What a nerve.
[1:56:36] Completely different. Hebrews chapter 2
[1:56:38] part one paragraph 14 then you see God
[1:56:41] doesn't deal with organizations he
[1:56:43] doesn't deal with groups of people he
[1:56:44] deals with individuals he reveals
[1:56:47] himself to individuals and now to say
[1:56:49] this God knows my heart not to say this
[1:56:51] for own personal praise just to be there
[1:56:55] but did you know that the same God the
[1:56:57] same Jesus is with us this morning do
[1:56:59] you know each one of you has a little
[1:57:02] individual witness of it right now that
[1:57:06] he's here. He's done something for us in
[1:57:09] this day. He didn't do it in other days.
[1:57:11] He had his picture taken in this day. We
[1:57:13] got it hanging right here to purify the
[1:57:15] same Lord Jesus. Watch how he works now.
[1:57:17] If he's the same Lord Jesus, he will do
[1:57:19] the same things. For the Bible say the
[1:57:20] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:57:22] Paris 16. Now, before Paul would
[1:57:24] announce anything, whether it was right
[1:57:27] or wrong, he first went down into Egypt
[1:57:29] and spent 3 years to find out if it was
[1:57:31] scriptural or not. Did you ever know
[1:57:34] that after Paul's conversion he went to
[1:57:36] Egypt for 3 years
[1:57:39] there he abode there is where he learned
[1:57:42] his great wisdom
[1:57:44] he actually got identity outside of the
[1:57:47] apostles
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; outside of the church
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; you're only manifesting sunship after
[1:57:59] you're converted
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; while you're You're unconverted. You're
[1:58:04] still a baby. You haven't come to
[1:58:06] sunship yet. This is what the true
[1:58:10] message of adoption needs to be. How do
[1:58:13] how are we preaching adoption to message
[1:58:16] people while treating them like babies?
[1:58:21] And the message God's wrapped gift. This
[1:58:23] is our last quote. Oh, no, it's not.
[1:58:25] Gracious.
[1:58:27] Still got a little bit more. And even uh
[1:58:30] upon those it fell on the in the
[1:58:32] beginning the children's organized
[1:58:33] denominated went bound into
[1:58:35] organizations till they're refusing the
[1:58:38] very god that their fathers receive.
[1:58:40] They claim their Pentecostal. Oh no
[1:58:42] doesn't make a s a horse to live in a
[1:58:44] barn.
[1:58:48] See you didn't even laugh at that.
[1:58:51] The city people know nothing.
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:55] He says it it doesn't make a pig a a
[1:58:58] female pig a horse if she lives in a
[1:59:01] barn.
[1:59:03] You know what that means? No. Indeed. No
[1:59:05] more than it does to make a Christian
[1:59:07] out of a man belonging to a Pentecostal
[1:59:09] church,
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Baptist, Presbyterian,
[1:59:16] message church.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; He's still a sinner until he's
[1:59:21] converted. It doesn't make you a
[1:59:24] Christian just because you belong to a
[1:59:26] church.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:59:29] &gt;&gt; When he's converted, he's born again of
[1:59:31] the spirit of God changed over. He's
[1:59:34] accepted Christ. The Holy Ghost has
[1:59:36] come, made him a new creature, a new
[1:59:38] creation.
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Since this makes me look at things
[1:59:42] differently, other people look at
[1:59:44] sinning like it's bad things.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; For me, sinning is
[1:59:49] becoming Wait. To me, uh, sinning has
[1:59:53] become about doing, uh, or or good
[1:59:57] things or bad things that do not benefit
[2:00:01] my position in Christ.
[2:00:04] I'm saying it again.
[2:00:08] Doing good things or or bad things. So,
[2:00:12] even doing good things that do not
[2:00:14] benefit my position in Christ is
[2:00:16] sinning.
[2:00:21] Even if I'm doing good, I'm a good
[2:00:24] message believer. I come to church, I
[2:00:26] read the message, I go through the
[2:00:28] motions, I go to all the conventions, I
[2:00:31] go to the combined meetings, but I'm
[2:00:33] doing nothing to further my position as
[2:00:36] a son of God, I'm still sinning.
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Because there's no conversion.
[2:00:44] Yeah.
[2:00:46] I I I tell youngsters, you go off, you
[2:00:50] want to make a career for yourself, you
[2:00:53] choose a career that takes you away from
[2:00:55] the word,
[2:00:58] that's sinning.
[2:01:00] Cuz you were chosen to be a son of God.
[2:01:04] How will you choose something? So
[2:01:06] listen, don't come and tell me you got a
[2:01:08] gift to playing soccer. You might go
[2:01:09] play for Barcelona.
[2:01:12] Don't worry. I'm a son of God. Well, I
[2:01:14] got no worries because I know where
[2:01:16] you're going to be.
[2:01:18] There's no such thing as playing for
[2:01:19] Barcelona or Real Madrid or Liverpool or
[2:01:22] whoever and tell me you're going to be a
[2:01:24] son of God.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; You are not going to win a single soul
[2:01:27] to Christ. Every time you put the jersey
[2:01:30] on or raise a cup or win something, it's
[2:01:33] all going to be self worship.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Everything in this world that you do
[2:01:40] that is self worship is sinning.
[2:01:44] Because you are, listen, the gloves are
[2:01:46] off now. We're not talking about
[2:01:48] drinking, smoking, fornicating, and all
[2:01:50] that. You are called to be a son of God,
[2:01:53] the bride of Christ. You claim it every
[2:01:56] day. You fellowship about it. You put it
[2:01:58] on the WhatsApp groups, but then you go
[2:02:00] act like a normal person out there.
[2:02:03] What? Work, pay the bills, put your kids
[2:02:05] through school, go to universities.
[2:02:08] Suffice it. Everything for Caesar.
[2:02:12] You're still sinning.
[2:02:16] Don't tell me you're walking in sunship.
[2:02:21] Types and shadows.
[2:02:24] Living in sin needs to change. It needs
[2:02:26] to refine itself.
[2:02:29] What are you doing with your existence
[2:02:31] and the open book that has been given to
[2:02:33] you?
[2:02:37] Types and shadows. Abraham received
[2:02:39] circumcision long after the call, right?
[2:02:44] He got the call, received the
[2:02:45] circumcision, and actually 25 years
[2:02:48] later, he got the promis.
[2:02:51] See, everybody in the message wants it.
[2:02:54] Now,
[2:02:55] I want the I want to be gotten. I want
[2:02:57] the Holy Ghost. I want the power. I want
[2:02:59] to take control of my life. I want to be
[2:03:02] recognized.
[2:03:04] You want to be recognized without going
[2:03:06] through the training.
[2:03:08] You want to You want your name to be out
[2:03:10] there without even going through the
[2:03:11] hardships?
[2:03:15] What? All these men slogged. Even the
[2:03:18] Christ who died for you, went to
[2:03:20] Gethsemane for you, went to the the
[2:03:22] Calvary road for you, went to the cross
[2:03:25] for you, and you want it all now in one
[2:03:27] second.
[2:03:30] Number two, Israel took 40 years to
[2:03:33] reach the promised land. David was
[2:03:35] anointed by Samuel. He only hit the
[2:03:38] throne as king long after he was
[2:03:40] anointed king.
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; He ran for his life most of the time and
[2:03:46] had to learn what it was to be a
[2:03:48] fugitive.
[2:03:50] The Lord Jesus was the only begotten son
[2:03:53] of the flesh. But his ministry only
[2:03:55] began after John's baptism at Jordan
[2:03:58] where the spirit of God descended upon
[2:03:59] him like a dove. Peter was only
[2:04:01] converted after Acts chapter 2.
[2:04:04] Nobody gets it in one go. Nobody gets it
[2:04:08] young people in one youth camp.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; Luke 22:32. But I have prayed for thee
[2:04:16] that thy faith fail thee not when thou
[2:04:19] art converted. Strengthen thy brethren.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want to ask you.
[2:04:27] This is where we are where we ought to
[2:04:28] be right now. Strengthening our
[2:04:31] brethren. This is my issue with the
[2:04:34] majority of message people. You live
[2:04:37] irresponsibly.
[2:04:40] You talk a whole lot at church or on
[2:04:44] WhatsApp groups or on fellowship. Anyone
[2:04:46] can send quotes and scriptures. Anyone
[2:04:49] can do stuff like that. But if you live
[2:04:52] irresponsibly where you don't strengthen
[2:04:54] your brethren, you are living out of
[2:04:57] purpose.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Period.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:02] Question and answers paragraph 46. Now
[2:05:06] we take the wrong in the word of
[2:05:07] conversion. Today we say that a man
[2:05:09] that's converted is a man that stopped
[2:05:10] drinking and everything, goes to church
[2:05:12] or joins the church. He might join the
[2:05:14] church but there's no sign he's
[2:05:16] converted. He isn't converted until his
[2:05:19] old life is dead and he's buried in
[2:05:22] Christ, risen with him, resurrection,
[2:05:24] newness of life when the Holy Spirit has
[2:05:26] created in him a new a living hope of
[2:05:28] eternal life. Saints,
[2:05:30] conversion is much more than what we
[2:05:33] assumed it to be. It means to be
[2:05:34] changed, turned around. This only has
[2:05:37] been made known by the revealing of the
[2:05:38] mysteries of the day.
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; This conversion stage is only when God
[2:05:43] can reveal the mysteries to you.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; After you know his identity, church's
[2:05:49] identity and you're learning your
[2:05:51] identity is the only time he can give
[2:05:53] you the open book. is the only time he
[2:05:55] can reveal mysteries to you. When you've
[2:05:57] made a conscious decision,
[2:06:01] the body is being converted by the word
[2:06:03] that is being revealed in it. Not that
[2:06:06] you won't make mistakes, but they'll the
[2:06:08] body will come under your subjection.
[2:06:10] Conversion is where the mysteries can be
[2:06:13] revealed to us. Conversion is where you
[2:06:15] are able to strengthen your brethren.
[2:06:17] Conversion is when you get your full
[2:06:20] identity. We are not dependent on mother
[2:06:23] church anymore. The church is now
[2:06:25] dependent on you.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; To do your purpose for bringing forth
[2:06:29] more sons. The prophet speaks of being
[2:06:32] convinced than concerned. He said you
[2:06:35] will never be concerned unless you are
[2:06:37] first convinced.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; So you can never be convinced until you
[2:06:43] are converted by the person of the Holy
[2:06:46] Ghost.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; As long as you have never received the
[2:06:48] new birth, don't tell me you got a
[2:06:51] desire to serve God's people.
[2:06:54] You're still a baby. You still depended
[2:06:56] on us. Right. The prophet speaks of
[2:07:00] being right. You are not convinced by
[2:07:02] intellectualism.
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; You're not convinced because the message
[2:07:06] makes sense. Young man, young woman.
[2:07:09] Because brother Al breaks it down so
[2:07:10] nicely for us. It's so simple for us to
[2:07:13] understand. It makes so much of sense.
[2:07:14] Glory to God. Hallelujah.
[2:07:17] It's not got to make sense.
[2:07:22] It's got to be absorbed as an identity.
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not convinced by
[2:07:27] intellectualism. This is a definite
[2:07:30] individual experience. Conversion is an
[2:07:32] individual experience. Anyone listen,
[2:07:35] anyone can have concern for people.
[2:07:39] There's many of us like that. There's
[2:07:41] many people out there who work for
[2:07:42] nonprofits and charity runs and they're
[2:07:45] genuinely concerned for people. That's
[2:07:47] not what we're talking about. Those
[2:07:50] people are concerned for people to feed
[2:07:51] their stomachs, to give them clothes.
[2:07:54] Where are the people who are concerned
[2:07:56] for the condition of souls?
[2:08:00] Where is that?
[2:08:03] H to have real concern for God's flock
[2:08:07] involves something else altogether.
[2:08:08] Let's read unfailing realities of the
[2:08:11] living God.
[2:08:15] We're closing now. The Holy Spirit comes
[2:08:18] today like mannered to present God to
[2:08:20] man. I I I read this already. Okay.
[2:08:23] Peter had been saved. Let's bypass that.
[2:08:26] I want to go to the next one. What was
[2:08:28] the Holy Ghost given for?
[2:08:32] Oh, hold on a bit.
[2:08:37] Okay, let's go to what was the Holy
[2:08:38] Ghost given for. He said, "Peter, I
[2:08:40] prayed for you." That's not Listen,
[2:08:43] that's not all of it. I prayed for you
[2:08:45] and after you are converted and
[2:08:47] strengthen your brethren. After you're
[2:08:49] converted, he shouted. He had probably
[2:08:50] danced in the spirit. He had done all
[2:08:52] kinds of things. He had done received
[2:08:53] the Holy Ghost, but he hadn't received
[2:08:55] the Holy Ghost yet. Here's the other
[2:08:57] thing. This is what I've been trying to
[2:08:59] tell you before and speaking to other
[2:09:01] message people. You shouted, danced in
[2:09:04] the spirit, all those things, and still
[2:09:05] not received the Holy Ghost yet.
[2:09:08] What's been preached now as the message
[2:09:11] is bringing back all this shouting,
[2:09:13] dancing, screaming, emotions and saying
[2:09:15] that's the Holy Ghost. When you've got
[2:09:17] the prophet literally saying you haven't
[2:09:19] received the Holy Ghost yet.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; Listen, shouting, dancing, screaming is
[2:09:25] church identity.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; It's not father's identity.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:31] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost must give you father's
[2:09:33] identity. Must connect you to your
[2:09:35] father. You must know who he is. Amen.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; The only thing I see amongst churches is
[2:09:40] they all know who they are,
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; who the church is. That's how they act.
[2:09:45] That's how they shout. That's how they
[2:09:47] worship. You literally get to another
[2:09:49] place and they say, "We're going to show
[2:09:50] you how we do it here.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in how you do it.
[2:09:59] I do me pretty fine. Thank you. I don't
[2:10:02] need to be like anybody else."
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "After you are
[2:10:06] converted, then strengthen your
[2:10:08] brethren." I like this last part. "Cry
[2:10:10] out his plan."
[2:10:13] Praise be to God. Carry out his plan.
[2:10:16] Conversion is coming into his plan. So
[2:10:20] lastly, in closing, he says, he says
[2:10:23] something amazing. You know, in um in
[2:10:26] John 21:15-17,
[2:10:29] Jesus said to Peter, "Peter, do you love
[2:10:31] me? Feed my lambs.
[2:10:34] Two verses later, Peter, do you love me?
[2:10:37] Yes, Lord, feed my sheep.
[2:10:40] Third time, Peter, do you love me? Peter
[2:10:42] goes, Lord, you know all things. It's
[2:10:45] like, why you asked me this so many
[2:10:47] times? He says, feed my sheep. So,
[2:10:50] brother man was asked this question.
[2:10:53] Why did he say, "Feed my lambs and feed
[2:10:55] my sheep." Right? So, watch what he
[2:10:57] said. Said, "You love me, Peter, feed my
[2:10:59] sheep." I like that. "Feed my sheep.
[2:11:01] Feed my sheep." And this is for
[2:11:04] ministers.
[2:11:05] He says, "Don't drive them. Don't feed
[2:11:08] uh don't drive them. Feed them." He
[2:11:10] didn't say, "Drive them.
[2:11:13] &gt;&gt; Feed them." The word. They like sheep
[2:11:16] food. The sheep food is the good old
[2:11:18] time feeling of old time salvation. Just
[2:11:21] as free as you can feel. And there is no
[2:11:24] condemnation.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; You feed sheep sheep food that has no
[2:11:30] condemnation.
[2:11:32] We used to stand and clap our hands. I
[2:11:34] feel all right. There's no condemnation
[2:11:35] in my heart. Okay, I want you to go back
[2:11:37] home. I don't have the time to do it
[2:11:38] now. Go check all the other quotes.
[2:11:41] Brother Bam says in another quote, he
[2:11:44] said he said feed my sheep. He said he
[2:11:47] didn't say kick them.
[2:11:50] He didn't say drive them.
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Don't put a burden on them to make them
[2:11:55] crawl and see them suffer. Said
[2:11:57] ministers instead of feeding them, they
[2:11:59] take them to shear them.
[2:12:02] He said they make them pledge their
[2:12:04] homes, their old age pensions and
[2:12:07] everything. The prophet said that you
[2:12:10] strip them of their money, their
[2:12:13] livelihoods.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Take everything from them and don't feed
[2:12:17] them.
[2:12:19] Says don't give them and another quoter
[2:12:21] said don't give them educational
[2:12:23] programs and denominational weeds.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; Feed them truth. He said,
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; "Feed them sheep food. That's what they
[2:12:32] need." Strengthening your brethren and
[2:12:35] feeding my sheep are both character
[2:12:38] linked to conversion.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Feed my sheep. Strengthen your brethren.
[2:12:45] After you're converted, did did you see
[2:12:47] that?
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. The true sign of the Holy Ghost.
[2:12:51] This is it, saints. This is my concern.
[2:12:53] You can we can go out and feed hungry
[2:12:55] people. We can go out and give clothes.
[2:12:57] I do that. I I meet somebody, I'll pay
[2:13:00] for their groceries or something. It's
[2:13:02] from the bottom of my heart, but they
[2:13:03] look at me and think, "Oh, what a nice
[2:13:05] man." That's all, and then they go away.
[2:13:08] Nobody says he's got the word of God.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; You can feed hungry. This is why Peter
[2:13:14] Paul said, "Though I give to charity,
[2:13:16] though I give to the poor, I'm still
[2:13:18] nothing."
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; The true sign of the Holy Ghost is
[2:13:22] crying and sighing for the sin of your
[2:13:25] community. The true side of the Holy
[2:13:27] Ghost is the care for the souls of man.
[2:13:34] The care for the sinfulness of the souls
[2:13:36] of man. That's the true sign of the Holy
[2:13:39] Ghost. That's father's identity.
[2:13:43] Father's identity is God so loved the
[2:13:46] world, he gave his only begotten son
[2:13:48] that whosoever
[2:13:50] should believe shall not perish but have
[2:13:52] everlasting life. Father's identity is
[2:13:55] he cares for the souls of man.
[2:14:00] You may be in a you know knowing the
[2:14:04] struggle and challenge of the time. What
[2:14:06] are we doing to strengthen those who are
[2:14:08] struggling spiritually?
[2:14:11] It's easy for you here in this church.
[2:14:13] You get along with people who are
[2:14:14] strong. You have lunches and dinners
[2:14:17] with each other. You get together and
[2:14:19] have a bri on a Saturday. But there are
[2:14:22] people here who are struggling
[2:14:23] spiritually.
[2:14:25] Are you strengthening your brethren? Are
[2:14:28] you recognize recognizing their need?
[2:14:31] They're struggling spiritually.
[2:14:34] Some of you won't even wait around to
[2:14:36] chat with them in a car park,
[2:14:38] let alone inviting them for a meal.
[2:14:42] We don't really care about their
[2:14:44] stomachs.
[2:14:49] Knowing the struggle and challenge of
[2:14:51] the time, what are we doing to
[2:14:53] strengthen those who are struggling
[2:14:54] spiritually? How are we feeding the
[2:14:56] sheep? You may be in a begotten stage
[2:14:59] enjoying church, feeding off the church,
[2:15:02] benefiting from it, and think you have
[2:15:05] reached your purpose. Well, let me tell
[2:15:06] you what's going to happen because
[2:15:07] that's what's happening right now in the
[2:15:09] message.
[2:15:10] The people you grow up in the message,
[2:15:14] the message turns you into this great
[2:15:16] person. You get married. You go off get
[2:15:20] your job. You get your millions. You
[2:15:23] bring up your children. You put them
[2:15:25] through the best schools. You bring them
[2:15:27] up into the public. And then you leave
[2:15:29] the message and call brother a false
[2:15:31] prophet.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; And you walk away from us and you
[2:15:35] benefited from us all the years only to
[2:15:38] slap us in the face on your way out.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's what's happening right now. You
[2:15:45] should rather leave. Leave and tell us
[2:15:48] nothing. We don't want to know what you
[2:15:50] believe. Just leave us alone. You sucked
[2:15:53] us off like a parasite for many years
[2:15:55] only to come back at the end after you
[2:15:58] were nothing and got educated here,
[2:16:00] learned the gospel, learned the Bible,
[2:16:02] learned the message, became a professor
[2:16:04] of the message, only to correct the
[2:16:05] person you learned from.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; And call him a false prophet.
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; Why not just leave? Don't tell us
[2:16:13] anything. Don't tell us what you know.
[2:16:15] Don't tell us. Just leave quietly
[2:16:18] and let us lick our wounds for having
[2:16:20] taken care of you for all these years
[2:16:24] while the rest of us lived responsibly,
[2:16:27] lived our lives, lived without sin,
[2:16:30] lived without falling for you. Then you
[2:16:33] grow up and slap us in the face on your
[2:16:34] way out.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; That is not even disingenuous. That is
[2:16:41] immoral. That is low in character. Just
[2:16:44] leave. have the feeling of galial. Go
[2:16:47] away. Say this in your heart. If it is
[2:16:50] of God, it will prosper. Let me not say
[2:16:52] any evil thing about it.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; Do that.
[2:16:58] But this is what's happening. And you
[2:17:00] young people get that notion. I'm
[2:17:03] telling you, brother El's not going to
[2:17:04] be a nice guy in that day. You come to
[2:17:06] me with that story.
[2:17:08] You're going to see something you
[2:17:09] haven't seen before. I'm not going to
[2:17:11] sit there and listen to you tell me what
[2:17:13] the message is and what the Bible is
[2:17:15] after we've taken care of you and raised
[2:17:17] you up with kid gloves and love in our
[2:17:20] hearts. You can do that somewhere else
[2:17:23] where there's other church who
[2:17:24] subjugated you and ruled you with a rod
[2:17:26] of iron. But here where we treated you
[2:17:28] gently, answered your questions, labored
[2:17:31] with you, and then you come to that spot
[2:17:32] where light bulb goes off in your head
[2:17:34] and you want to tell me brother's a
[2:17:36] false prophet. Just walk away quietly.
[2:17:41] That'll be better.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; You may have been born of the spirit,
[2:17:45] become someone who identify yourself
[2:17:47] with a message group and a prophet.
[2:17:50] You're singing songs. You're enjoying
[2:17:52] your identity in the community. You
[2:17:54] enjoy your participation. You sing song
[2:17:56] specials. You like to be noticed. You
[2:17:59] like to be appreciated. You've even been
[2:18:01] conforming with some real stiff
[2:18:04] standards and laws because you feel safe
[2:18:06] with mother.
[2:18:08] H. What's going to happen? Russia bombs
[2:18:10] someone. You're going to run back here
[2:18:11] and feel safe.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, just let California sink and watch
[2:18:17] all those hypocrites come running back.
[2:18:27] But then when the mysteries are being
[2:18:29] preached, you become discouraged. When
[2:18:32] the real tough challenging things in the
[2:18:35] word are being taught that will separate
[2:18:37] goats from the sheep and it is time for
[2:18:40] identity to change. Amen.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to see. I want to see
[2:18:46] people who are not depending on church
[2:18:48] identity. I want to see people who are
[2:18:50] not depending on father's identity. I
[2:18:53] want to see sons of god come to their
[2:18:55] identity. Amen.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to die someday knowing
[2:18:59] I've preached a word that has brought
[2:19:02] people to their identity. Given them the
[2:19:05] ability to go out and speak the word.
[2:19:08] There is absolutely no excuse. Young
[2:19:11] man, you are over 18 and you're in
[2:19:14] university and college. You are in the
[2:19:16] working world. You have no excuse for
[2:19:18] not talking about Christ.
[2:19:21] And don't give me that shy story. Talk
[2:19:23] about everything else.
[2:19:28] You have no excuse for not saying I
[2:19:30] believe this message to tell people I
[2:19:33] believe this message. This is what I
[2:19:34] stand for. I do not do that. I do not
[2:19:37] participate in that. This is what I
[2:19:39] believe. Our prophet was brother
[2:19:41] Brandham.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; I believe in the message of the hour.
[2:19:46] &gt;&gt; This is my church. This is what we stand
[2:19:48] for. You have no excuse for not talking
[2:19:51] about it. All the people you've gone 20
[2:19:54] years in the message you're working in
[2:19:56] all your companies you have no excuse
[2:19:59] for succumbing to their ideas.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; It is time. The challenge is now. It is
[2:20:08] time. Those challenging things of the
[2:20:10] word are being taught right now and they
[2:20:12] will separate sheep from the goats.
[2:20:14] Remember I told you a while back you
[2:20:16] want to look for everything elsewhere.
[2:20:18] Mark of the beast everywhere else you
[2:20:20] will have to look left and right.
[2:20:22] right where you sit there are people
[2:20:25] experiencing right now if I tell you the
[2:20:27] number of parents I'm getting messages
[2:20:29] from people in other countries in other
[2:20:32] cities in this country saying pray for
[2:20:35] my children they have left the message
[2:20:41] brother Alistister please pray for my
[2:20:43] three children they have left the
[2:20:44] message
[2:20:50] that time's coming. That time's coming
[2:20:52] for you.
[2:20:55] It's time to know. And is this a,
[2:20:59] you know, those of you, you got children
[2:21:01] who are still young and think you got a
[2:21:04] life sorted,
[2:21:07] wait till they're teenagers.
[2:21:10] Those of you who don't even have
[2:21:12] children yet. And this this is the the
[2:21:15] tragedy of people who think they can
[2:21:18] leave the message while they have
[2:21:19] children
[2:21:21] that are still young.
[2:21:24] Tell tell me what you got out there.
[2:21:28] Just just tell me which denomination do
[2:21:30] you go to that's that's going to help
[2:21:33] your kids out there.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; What do you have out there?
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; It's not even logical.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[2:21:43] It won't even be long. Your daughter
[2:21:45] will be acting like a guy dressing like
[2:21:48] a not even 5 minutes and your son is
[2:21:51] going to be a weirdo.
[2:21:54] Not even 5 minutes.
[2:22:00] They'll turn against you in a heartbeat.
[2:22:03] If you know anything about human nature,
[2:22:06] the moment your son is in love with a
[2:22:09] girl, he turns away from you
[2:22:10] immediately.
[2:22:13] Then what do you have to say? You've got
[2:22:14] no faith base. You've got no church.
[2:22:17] You've got no Holy Ghost. You've got no
[2:22:19] father's identity. You've got no
[2:22:20] mother's identity. What identity do you
[2:22:23] have in your home? Where's your moral
[2:22:25] standard? Where's anything that you have
[2:22:28] to hold your children to? You've got
[2:22:30] nothing.
[2:22:33] And it's all those people who leave and
[2:22:36] find out the hard way what happens. You
[2:22:38] young people, you you come to that point
[2:22:41] in your life where you feel like I know
[2:22:43] everything right now. I can leave what
[2:22:45] mom and dad said. I can go do my own
[2:22:47] thing. You're heading down a slippery
[2:22:49] slope.
[2:22:52] &gt;&gt; You have been commissioned. You have
[2:22:54] been given father's identity for a
[2:22:57] reason. You got to find your identity.
[2:23:00] You've got to be converted.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:04] And it's time to know and embrace your
[2:23:07] identity in Christ. It is the time now
[2:23:09] for those of full age to stand and
[2:23:12] strengthen what remains and feed his
[2:23:14] sheep. When you are converted, when you
[2:23:18] are converted, you'll have no desire to
[2:23:22] leave. You'll have a desire to
[2:23:24] strengthen your brethren.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; That will consume you. If if I I'm I'm
[2:23:31] closing. My notes are down. If I look at
[2:23:34] every one of the the saints of God in
[2:23:36] the past, all of them who got the Holy
[2:23:39] Ghost, all of them who got that desire,
[2:23:43] they literally left families, traveled
[2:23:46] across the world, got into ships, got on
[2:23:48] horseback,
[2:23:50] came back home after months to see wife
[2:23:53] and children, left them bringing back
[2:23:56] maybe tuppens or change to give them
[2:23:58] money to survive. Fortunately, in those
[2:24:00] days, they were growing their own foods,
[2:24:02] having their own goat and sheep and
[2:24:04] cattle and feeding themselves. They
[2:24:06] didn't have to have jobs. But yes, but
[2:24:08] they went and did those things to
[2:24:10] strengthen their brethren, to take the
[2:24:12] word to the world, to speak to others
[2:24:15] around them. While daddy was gone
[2:24:17] preaching in Italy somewhere in Rome,
[2:24:20] mom and children were at home speaking
[2:24:22] to those in the neighborhood.
[2:24:28] It's not only daddy's job.
[2:24:32] See,
[2:24:34] this is this is where we ought to be
[2:24:36] today. If you if you want to know why it
[2:24:38] is we're failing, why it is there's
[2:24:40] failures in your life. Why is it there's
[2:24:42] troubles in your family? It's because
[2:24:44] there's no purpose.
[2:24:47] Some of you be sitting there thinking,
[2:24:48] "Brother Al, you're talking about
[2:24:49] purpose, purpose, purpose, purpose,
[2:24:50] purpose."
[2:24:52] Yep. This is it. I've been I've been
[2:24:56] ringing this bell and blowing their horn
[2:24:58] forever and ever for the last I I would
[2:25:01] say like since 2018
[2:25:03] when I did in December 2018 I did
[2:25:07] personal purpose, family purpose, church
[2:25:09] purpose
[2:25:11] in three weekends in December
[2:25:15] and uh and then co hit and took away
[2:25:19] everything
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; for a good reason to really test your
[2:25:24] metal.
[2:25:26] But now it's time. Amen. And I believe
[2:25:29] it's time for accountability. It's time
[2:25:31] for us to We can't keep hogging this
[2:25:33] Holy Ghost for ourselves, this
[2:25:36] anointing, this open book, and be
[2:25:37] satisfied with with messages every
[2:25:40] Sunday and Wednesday and just shouting
[2:25:41] amens and hallelujah and glory to God
[2:25:43] and fellowshipping with those we agree
[2:25:45] with. No, the challenge is is at your
[2:25:48] doorstep.
[2:25:49] Amen. Let's bow our heads together.
