TRANSCRIPT
========================================
We're going to read from Acts chapter 10 verse 38. All right. Acts 10:38 says, "How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him." Amen. So, we're going to look at that statement. God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power. So, once again, uh good to be here with you and uh greetings in his precious name. So, um we're going to look at uh question and answers. Brother Michael, this I don't know if the this is not working, but we'll just uh All right. Question and answers. Uh let's go to a title page. So, it's going to be question and answers um on the Holy Ghost and sexuality. But don't worry about the last part. It's not going to be uh too hectic. It's just questions. So, what's happened is uh from the time I I preached and uh as I'm traveling through, I'm starting to get questions and I've got questions from young people, some beautiful questions from young people and from others. And so I've got four questions that we're going to do today. And um uh but I'm going to explain something to you just to make you understand. So the message the message community in the world is not as you think it is. It's very diverse. It's very different. Um there's I wouldn't even say that you go to churches and you feel that everyone is united. It isn't that way. I mean in our own city you can barely get along with each other and yet we are serving the same word. We are of the and I think maybe it's got to be that way so we don't become a denomination. So I'm not averse to that. I'm just I love the people of God. I love the ministries. I love to listen to different ministries and I love learning of the things of God but do not ever think that when we go to places it's just a case of everyone accepts uh you know who you are what you say so I mean like the message I preached on dimensions when I preached it first here in a in a combined in Durban it was largely rejected the next message I preached at brother Charles which was on the seventh seal that was the next service I preached at combined service it was largely rejected and yet everywhere else it's accepted and when I say rejected I mean when I preach dimensions here the next day I was getting hammered on WhatsApp groups &gt;&gt; by the ministers here in Durban for the things that I said and you just got to roll with it because we're preaching I'm telling you brother Steve was preaching things from like for example let me give you an example North America is a very difficult place. They are so divided with so many things. When I got there in 1995, they were having such a problem with the return ministry. Most of you don't even know what that is because it's never affected us. We've never you never seen people in Africa claiming that brother Ben Baram is going to return and preach and he's going to be here 40 days before the translation. Have any of you heard that? No. Yeah, you may have heard that, but do you know of any churches here in South Africa that that preached that? No, that stuff has never affected us. So when we went there in '95, we were there for for 32 days and brother Steve preached 30 services. We were moving from state to state through America and Canada. And every church we went to was being affected by this. And it seemed these people in 1995 had not got a handle on what the third pool was. And u what I'm saying to you is we're going there to where the message comes from. And we've already been preaching the third pool. Brother Steven been preaching the time of life. The seven seal is open. Preaching the uh I'll write this trail one more time, the truth of it. And we get there and the people are struggling to some of the the biggest churches you might think of. They were having splits and divides and they were just and this is how it is. And you go there, you preach the seventh seal. You think we get there and you you're preaching we're in the eighth day. We're out of Leodysia. We're in the bride age. And you get there and there's people just against you. and you you you preach the seventh seal and there's people there who don't believe the seventh seal is open &gt;&gt; and we're shocked because you're coming from Africa and you the culture has always been that America has to send missionaries to Africa because you know we're ignorant and we're the natives who everyone has to save. That's how it has always been. And then we get there and realize we are not even confounded on these doctrines. Seven thunder, seven virtues comes from there. Peruia comes from there. Two lords comes from there. &gt;&gt; To the point where I got so fed up with with them in in I think it would have been 2010. Oh no, not 2020. After 2013, brother Bob, this is how I got to meet brother Chad. Brother Bob from our church came to me and brought me discs, you know, and he was telling me there's brother Chad, there's brother Eugene Brawn, you got to listen to these brothers and brother Steve Bryson. And he said they're one I I and he said they're wonderful. They they're preaching the open book, brother. I said to him, "Brother Bob, please do not give me any more American preachers. I'm done with them because they come here and cause trouble." And uh I'm just telling you this because um you know this is what it is when you get there and you've got to face things because there are nation grounded on the Christian principles and of lately Pentecostalism very steeped in Pentecostalism and because brother Barham came from there and because all the ministries that were with brother Barham were there in a large influence to most of the churches and um So I told brother Bob, you know, I just I don't want to hear anything. And eventually he said to me, "No, no, you've got to listen to this, brother, brother Chad." And so I said, "You know what? Okay, I don't even have a DVD player. Uh I don't know how I'm going to do this." And eventually someone gave me a laptop with a with a DVD player and I stuck it in and I listened to Brother Chad and I was, "Wow, this is amazing. this brother is uh he's speaking our language, &gt;&gt; you know, and u so I didn't even know where brother Duno was after that. I didn't even know he was a pastor. And um so a lot of things had happened and ministries that started coming up and we were just growing without anybody knowing us. I didn't even care to be known. I wasn't interested in doing outreach work in this place because every bush you kick, a pastor is popping out. And it's like if you step on anybody's grounds then you're offending them. So we just stayed real quiet, preached the word, grew as a church, you know, and that's how we were happy. So but now something has happened because I get to brother brother Chad's place. I get to uh America and then I preach on the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit. To start off with that wasn't my title. My title was a purposeful nature. the subject was the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and I was going to bring a point and um um so but anyway the the the video goes up on YouTube and people listen to it. Now, now here is a big problem with YouTube, which is why I don't like it. Because people listen to the meeting or what you preach without being there under the anointing. &gt;&gt; And when there when you're not there under the anointing, it's so easy for you to look at it, rewind it, go back, rewind it. I don't know what you say now with with videos, but you take it back, you go back, you slice, cut, peel everything, and you're not even there under the anointing. And it's very easy to criticize people when you were not even there in the service. And I don't think it was a few days that I already started getting push back and I didn't know about this. I only learned about this when I got back home. Now I didn't even know about all this issue because they they had a problem with me as if I was trying to say the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit are two different things, which is not what I did. And um anyway, what's uh the reason why I even prayed I I want to be contrite in my spirit and I I want to do this as with the greatest humility. So I'm not doing this to fight back at them, but to answer questions that were given to me. So without even knowing what was going on, I already started receiving questions from some young people and things about the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost, and so on. So that's what we're going to do. Now, the the the thing about it is I I I literally got accused of preaching a false doctrine. By the time I got back, it's like I'm preaching a false doctrine. And and that's how fast it goes to he's preaching a false doctrine, &gt;&gt; right? It's incredible. Uh and missed the whole point of the whole thing. Now this subject I preached to us in 2012 from 2012 to now have any of you people seen the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit as a doctrine. You don't even know because we don't even make a big thing. When people make a doctrine of something they write it in songs they make songs out of it. They uh make a big deal out of it. They they speak about it and make it. None of you even know or think that I make any significance between Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit in this church. We've never done that. And so but you know that when I spoke about in 2012 uh our series began with the question the question that was sent to me was from the message two particular quotes where brother Brandham says uh where brothers asked the question is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit the uh different and brother Bham said no they're the same. That's where our series starts from. And for me and the way God has wired me is when I see that I just don't get caged by that. &gt;&gt; To me, I know brother Benam is a part of the seven seals. So when he says something and when there's a question on something in me, it's like uh there's something in front of me and I'm chasing it and I'm not going to stop until I find out what's going on and and it turns into a series. So that's what happened with us and it blessed us so much brought out so much and um so what what I realized in that time from 2012 was that things were happening in South Africa and I remember going to a meeting where there was a brother from another country who preached here and said any minister any pastor who does not have the gifts of the Holy Ghost following his ministry is source. He has to have a supernatural element to his ministry. And that was a pastor from Africa who was preaching here in Derby. And I heard him say that I was there and you had a whole bunch of people uh standing up and shouting and you know and when when I I'm not a person who likes to fight with quotes or scriptures. I like to say what's on my heart and because for every quote I have someone has a hundred others or for every quote someone else has I have a hundred others and then we waste time on quotes but just say what's on your heart &gt;&gt; so when I look at it and I say what's in my heart I say but which one of you has supernatural element what are you jumping up for &gt;&gt; what do you do you prophesy speak in tongues is Holy Ghost fire over you or you know like what what is it? Where's the supernatural element and but everyone claims to and apparently the the greatest supernatural element right now is shouting. &gt;&gt; Okay, because that seems to be an uh and some evidence of the Holy Ghost. So that's been going on for over a decade and they've been trying to resurrect that and they somehow feel that is an evidence or an outpouring of the Holy Ghost when you get people to shout. So I don't know. And then this thing has reached America. And and to me it's a joke because America doesn't even know what noise is because as as vibrant as they think they are when they come to Africa or when Africa goes to them they they pale in comparison because we are from Africa. &gt;&gt; In here the noise is where it originates. Yes, &gt;&gt; the drums, the shouting, the dancing, the screaming, the theatrics, the superstitions, everything is a sign, every dream is a is a message from God. This is where we came from. And when we see them trying to resurrect what happened in the 70s and 80s that happened with Joseph Coleman movement, to us, this is you you're trying to bring back something that already died and failed in our country. And we know what results it brought and how dangerous it is. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we've we've walked a long road, right? And my purpose for preaching on the the the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit in the way that that it was presented was to bring clarity, but I instead I think I brought a little bit of confusion. So I do take um you know that that perhaps I should have I mean I'm I'm condensing like a 20 part series into one service and uh but anyway when you read let's go to the scripture. Let's see if this works. There we go. How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power. Okay. So we're going to get to some of the discrepancies in a short while. Now, this is what I don't like about the message community in general because when they can't explain something, they act like ostriches with their heads stuck in the sand. When I ask them, "How do you explain this?" They don't know how to explain this. And particularly our children, because when you tell them, "We're not trinitarian. We're not wonders." But now explain this. God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power. Does that mean Jesus of Nazareth did not have the Holy Ghost before? Because he was anointed at John's baptism. So that means was he not the fullness of the Godhead bodily before John's baptism? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Did he not have the Holy Spirit in him? Now when I get to youth camps, these are the questions I get asked. This is the reason why I've got to go in, dissect things, slice it open, study it to pieces before I get there and answer questions of the young people of today. I don't get questions on how to redo um Godhead theory for old people. &gt;&gt; That's not the questions I get asked. When when you have young people struggling with immorality, they're not interested in your theory and how right you are with quotes scriptures. You got to get down to reality with them, right? &gt;&gt; So God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with a whole No matter how you like to gloss over it, this looks like there are three people in the Godhead. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Who who is God? Is God the Father or is God the Holy Ghost? Who is it that anointed Jesus? And why did Jesus have to be anointed? What does it mean that he was anointed? If you say you have a revelation of the Godhead and you know what the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost uh whatever you want to call it is, I would love to hear you explain the scripture right now. Let me let me show you how. Right. If you're a trinitarian, it's pretty straightforward. God the Father anointed God the Son with God the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which is not wrong, but it offers no revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. It just allows for the splitting of God into three persons. Saying that God the Father anointed, God the Son with God the Holy Ghost allows as it mulls over in your mind and matures, it it it makes you move into trinitarianism. &gt;&gt; It splits God into three. Right? If you're a weird kind of oneness person, then you will say God anointed God with God. Agreed. &gt;&gt; Right. If you're a confused message person, you're still struggling for an explanation. If you're an intellectual message believer, you're going to say, "God anoints the word made flesh with the spirit of adoption." Jesus said, "Believe me for the work sake, the works that I do in my father's name." And trust me, nobody gives me the same answer. Everyone has their own answer in the message. Not that I want the same answer. I'm just saying when you ask this question, you actually realize who really understands the Godhead. If you have the open book, you're going to say what this means is God vindicated his chosen vessel with manifested works of great ability. That's what it means. God anointed the vessel he chose with manifested works of great ability. It's not even a godhead question. &gt;&gt; But you only see that if you have the open book. &gt;&gt; It actually is not even a godhead statement. It's like saying um at a specific time when when it was time for the Lord Jesus to go into his ministry, he gave him the spirit of God came upon that body and anointed it with specific abilities. That's all that it means. It's not even talking about godhead. But people will get tied up in the details. But you'll only have that if you have the open book. Now people look at the scriptures and try to argue the viewpoint and miss the real scripture. What is the truth being spoken here? Right? The truth is God created his own body to bring salvation to mankind. &gt;&gt; God then allowed that body to be born of a woman and allowed it to be subjected to experiencing normal human life from infancy to adulthood. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when the time was right, he gave that body a signal and an ability to go out and do things that would vindicate and testify that the body that he was dwelling in was not merely any man but a God man, the son of man. &gt;&gt; That's what that whole thing actually signifies. God made himself a body destined it to go through normal human life till it comes to a point where he gives it ability and a signal to start going out and preaching producing the ministry it's meant for and bring salvation to mankind. There's no trinitarian doctrine discussion in that. &gt;&gt; Do you see how far from the truth you would be if you do not have the open book? Do you see how you won't be able to have revelation if you have a denominational understanding of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Right? Why would Jesus need to be anointed with the Holy Ghost? If he was already the fullness of the Godhead bodily, that's why it is important to know what the Holy Ghost is and why you must have it. This is the reason for us preaching that series on the Holy Ghost uh in 2012. Remember that what the middle of the road with the Holy Ghost. And uh so I'm going to go to question one and then we're going to get into what the discrepancy here is about. All right. So let's go to the question Michael question one. Okay. So this is the first question from what you preached that is uh in the United States. I understand the need to distinguish between the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the person of the Holy Ghost. It is true that many do not understand this. I also don't understand everything completely but I believe the word completely. How I love sincere questions. However, there will always be a problem with all the statements made in the message where the prophet uses the two phrases as you said interchangeably. How does one navigate through all of that without bringing confusion? This is a sincere question. This is saying I get that you that you're showing us there's a difference between the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the person of Christ and I believe the word completely. That means this person is not resistant to what I'm saying. It's not even but all they're saying is when I go through the message or if I read my Bible and I'm seeing Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost, am I supposed to make a a distinction? Uh, and I don't even do that, right? But am I supposed to make a distinction? And am I supposed to make a big deal of it when I read the message now and I see Holy Spirit then Holy Ghost? Am I supposed to be so conscious of making a distinction between the two words to to simply say no? The answer is no. We don't have to do that. That's not what I was saying at all when I preached this message. But I want to start with this because I want to show you where our series actually began from. Let's go to um the first quote. So this is an actual question from question and answers. Um someone asked brother Brandham, we know the blessed holy spirit is not given to vain repetition in laying out the holy scriptures. So please tell me why the word Holy Spirit is used sometimes and the word Holy Ghost is used at other times. I know there is a valid reason about reason for this and I would like to know why. Here's brother Mar's answer. It's the self same word. A spirit and ghost is the very same thing. A ghost or spirit doesn't matter. They're just the same self. Let's go to the next quote. Um how can I overcome? Here, brother Mammy's talking about some holiness people that he met or I'm not sure. As I was talking to someone the other day, they're being very careful, even many of the holiness groups, not to call the Holy Ghost Holy Ghost cuz they identify themselves with Pentecostals when they do that. So the people in the denominational churches at that time who did not want to use the the term Holy Ghost because the term Holy Ghost became fashionable among Pentecostals. So there were people being careful and were using the term holy spirit right they say holy spirit see keep them saying holy ghost because the pentecostal common people just call it what the bible says holy ghost brother bam statement which holy go hol hol hol hol hol hol hol hol hol hol holy spirit and holy ghost is the same thing but they're very careful about it they don't want to be identified with them tongues speaking people and that's the holy spirit itself amen so when you look at these quotes which is where our series in 2012 started from you say brother Alistister your statements making the difference is just canceled because of what brother Brandham says because it's clear brother he says the holy spirit and the holy ghost is the same right and so obviously when I see quotes like this here this doesn't stop me that's what I'm saying because there's an understanding behind this &gt;&gt; there's a reason why the prophet for example brother Benam even says Father is the same as Holy Ghost. Brother, there's another quote where he says, "Father is the self, same spirit as Holy Spirit." Holy Ghost. Does that mean they're the same? All right. So, hold on. The first thing you must know is if you think you're going to get the revelation of this whole thing from just two quotes as compared with thousands of others and the scriptures, then we're in trouble. And I tell you why we're in trouble because we've already seen the trouble that's been taking place amongst our young people. And that we're going to get to at the end. Firstly, in the message I preached even in BCF, I didn't make the differentiation. I was not the one who made the differentiation. I merely pointed out that the translators of the Bible did it. Right? And that brother Brandham made a difference between. So the translators of the Bible made a difference between Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost, right? Literally seven times Holy Spirit is spoken in the Bible, three times in the Old Testament, four times in the New, and 89 times only in the New Testament do we hear the words Holy Ghost. I didn't do that. The translators did it. Right? And um brother Brandham then makes a difference which the Bible doesn't do. The Bible does not say baptism of the Holy Ghost or baptism of the Holy Spirit. It does not say that. The Bible does not even make a difference between baptism of the Holy Ghost and the person of the Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham does that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So there are times when brother Bam uses the term Holy Spirit and he's referring to now this is the reason why I got into this because the young people and some because of how it was being preached at the time when sometimes when brother Baron speaks about the Holy Spirit he's actually referring to the baptism and there's times where he's speaking about the Holy Spirit and then that time he's speaking about the person and then it's a time brother speaking he says says the Holy Ghost and he's speaking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And there's another time he speaks about he uses the word Holy Ghost and he's speaking about the person of the Holy Ghost. So what I was saying to them was when you're reading, make sure you make the differentiation between the gifts and the person. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's two different things. &gt;&gt; Okay. So all that I was doing was and I feel like yeah maybe it wasn't necessary for me to have gone into that but I was I was trying to share the excitement of the study that brings us up to that understanding right maybe that complicated things for the North Americans but I I don't know it didn't do anything for us here uh when we spoke about it there are many times where brother man uses both the phrases baptism of the Holy Ghost and baptism of the Holy Spirit. And there is no difference. If he says baptism of the Holy Ghost, it's the same thing as baptism of the Holy Spirit. There isn't any difference, right? It's throughout the message because now when you look at those two phrases, baptism of the Holy Ghost, baptism of the Holy Spirit, we don't you don't have a problem with that because the word baptism sorts it out, right? So there is no need for us to distinguish between. So here I'm saying it openly so that people will hear it and gladly brother Tim will put this on YouTube to clear up anyone else who's who who's listening to that. I am saying it there is no need for anyone to go and make a differentiation between Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost or make a big deal out of it because I believe everything the prophet said. It is the selfsame being. It's not two different entities, &gt;&gt; right? So most people um or rather there's and there's no there's no need for us to make the distinguishing between the two and I'm saying this today today in 2025 today in our age today in the capstone age in brother Brandham's day there's no need because I'll show you some quotes how surprising and shocking they are okay to most people today in the message And in Christianity, the two phrases are exactly the same. Right? To all Christians, actually, they're just the same. And there's a reason for that. Uh and and basically to Christians, it means the same person in the Godhead. And yet, not many people truly understand what the Holy Spirit is. Most people cannot even differentiate between Holy Ghost and the Father. I know this. I've spoken to ministers. I've spoken to message people. If I ask them, the father is a spirit. The holy ghost is what? A spirit. So what's the difference? What's the difference between father and holy spirit? And message people do not know. message ministers do not know. They don't even know why it's called holy spirit. What is the difference between the the god is a spirit? Is that right? &gt;&gt; God is a spirit and those that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. So what is the difference between god who is a spirit, the father who is a spirit and the holy spirit? I stood there in North America and said to them, "Holy Spirit is the spirit of God in reference to man." That's the revelation. That's the difference. It's a spirit that has to do with man. The spirit of God, it has to do with man, right? How do we know this? The prophet asked this and asked this question. We're not asked the question. He actually does it very sarcastically. And I like him that he's sarcastic. The prophet asked sarcastically, "If the father was Jesus's father, and if the Bible said that Mary conceived of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; did Jesus have two fathers?" &gt;&gt; Remember that? &gt;&gt; He also used the bad word for illegitimate. &gt;&gt; Remember he said that makes him an illegitimate son having two fathers. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And he asked and and he asked that to stump trinitarians. And he had the message people mocking the trinitarians. See, he got them. Then I I asked the message people and understood that they had no understanding themselves. Okay. So my purpose for teaching this was multiffold. Firstly, to help young people who are confused because they have no identity. Because you only have identity when you receive the Holy Ghost. That's when you know who you are. It is that spirit that gives you the ability to cry aba &gt;&gt; that knows who your father is. Right? And uh because they don't know whether they have the Holy Ghost or not, what true what it truly is and to know what purpose it must give them. In teaching the Bible, the Bible's language, I used it to point out that the English translators saw a reason in their time to make a distinction. Yes, I know. Brother Baron said they're the same word and they What does he mean by it's the same word? It's not a different person. &gt;&gt; But why do the English translators make a different word? Okay. Okay. So, for those and I'm putting this out to finally lay it down if you don't know what Holy Spirit is from this day, you've been told, okay, the denominational people, uh, I've actually got something in my head. I I I learned something from the good my good friends from Canada who said to me, "You say denominational, it should be denominational." I think they're right. I think I'm going to change how I say it, denominational. So anyway, um the denominational people believe and when they look at the Bible like are you also with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; There is one word in the Old Testament in Hebrew and it's ru u a c h if you want to uh spell it simply ru which is basically the word for spirit and you break that word down it's got to do with air breathe breath wind ru so in other words when you read in Genesis chapter 1 and you read in and it says and the spirit of God moved moved upon the waters. The word is ruach. The ru moved upon the waters. Now I want to ask you, was that the Holy Spirit or was that the father? And now this is where I have fun with message people. Was that the Holy Spirit or was that the father? Now, so I've studied this. I've taken it to pieces. Okay? I when I study something, I literally go through the whole Bible. And I'm telling you this, all the way from Genesis right up to Moses, which is not far in chapters. It's just Genesis to Exodus. But in time, it's over 2,000 years, &gt;&gt; right? So from Genesis to Moses, you do not see the word holy. &gt;&gt; It's never called the Holy Spirit. It's called the spirit of God. same Hebrew word ruach. Why is holy introduced after Moses? Now there's your key. Now if if there was father, son, and holy ghost and they existed eternally for all time and holy spirit was the one brooding over the waters. And why are you being technical, brother? I'm not being technical. The writers of the Bible did this. Yes, &gt;&gt; they called him spirit of God or spirit or in Genesis 6, my spirit shall not always strive with man. Ruach. But when it comes to Moses for the first time, he says to Moses, take off your shoes from off your feet, for the ground where on you stand is holy. Then from there, he goes on, he says, you be ye holy as I am holy. You are called to be a holy people because I am a holy God. This is where the whole story of holy comes in. &gt;&gt; What is holy? Holy means set apart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Now for the first time, God is bringing a nation and a group of people to be set apart from others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not set apart from others as in separated like a partate. It is separated as in set apart for his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Prior to that, man served God without church, without law, without scripture. There was no holiness. They were not called to a law, a sacrifice, a um a tradition of religion. They were not called to a code of dressing. They were not called to a certain type of worship. They were not called to a brazen altar. They were not holy. &gt;&gt; Therefore, it was not holy spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was spirit of God. It's not me. It's the translators that did that. So when holiness came in, that means God brought in a way of worship. That is my holiness. &gt;&gt; Now you will have my spirit on you that will help you keep my holiness. That is holy spirit. same spirit of God. But now when it anoints Moses, when it anoints Aaron, when it anoints David, when David said, "Do not take your Holy Spirit from me." He was saying, "Do not take away the part that makes me set apart from all others to you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Holy Spirit means. This is what I'm saying. Most people do not understand this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. They they they stuck in trinitarianism that says it's a third person of trinity. Even if you're in the message and you're talking about the Holy Spirit and you don't know what it means right now, the English translators didn't stop there. So what changed when it's when it moved from just spirit of God to holy spirit? What changed? Dispensation &gt;&gt; manifestation, &gt;&gt; right? And up to Christ. I'm going to read a quote to you a little later to show you the transition from Christ. John the Baptist starts uh preaching about a change of dispensation of the spirit of God. Now the Bible is going to is going to say to you it's shifting. Right? So from from uh uh Moses now the words spirit of God and Holy Spirit are used in the Old Testament. Right? But now after Christ, you're going to hear Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit, and spirit of God. What changed? Dispensation and manifestation. &gt;&gt; But it's the same spirit. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same spirit that was on Adam. The same spirit that was with Noah. The same spirit that was it just the wording changed because of the manifestation. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's all we're saying. We're not saying it's another person or it's another we're we're talking about the change of manifestation and we're showing that the translators of the Bible identify that right you know I can do this exercise with you if you say okay I am traditional message if brother said that you should just not even say anything you should stick with that you should be bound by those two quotes and never get into anything else because do not do that. All right. So if so I'm saying to you let's take this exercise right? If you say Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost is exactly the same, there's no difference, the wording, right? Will you go to the Bible and swap the words up? Because the New International Version does that. It takes away the word Holy Ghost because the ghost started scaring the people in the last few hundred years. So they switched it out because ghost is like an apparition and they stuck in Holy Spirit where there should be Holy Ghost. Many of the Bibles do not have the word ghost anymore. It's all spirit. So I'm saying to you as traditional message uh religious people, will you go into the book of Ephesians 4:13 and say do not grieve the Holy Ghost by which you are sealed till the day of your redemption? Will you swap out the word Holy Spirit? Because the word there says Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Do not greet the Holy Spirit till the day of your redemption. Will you swap it out and put Holy Ghost in there? Are you okay with that? Does it even sound right to you? No, it doesn't. If you go and and read the message and everywhere brother in one sentence he will say by the same Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit does this. The same Holy Ghost there does did that the same the same Holy Spirit does this. Will you swap them and say they're the same? The moment you do that you change the thought &gt;&gt; that he is speaking. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You cannot say they are just interchangeable at every time. They are speaking of a manifestation. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the thing. They are speaking of a specific manifestation. You cannot also tell me that brother Brandham just willy-nilly he just uses Holy Ghost here, Holy Spirit there, Holy. No. He's speaking with the movement of the Holy Spirit. He's actually using those terminology purposefully. He's not just willy-nilly just saying things. Even so, in the Bible, right? So even with the uh translators that translated to English, they didn't just say, you know what, let's just use Holy Ghost here seven times and Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit here seven times and let's use 89 times in the old in the New Testament. Let's use the word Holy Ghost. Uh there's no difference. Let's just use it to have variety. Let's just use spirit of God. Yeah, there holy spirit there. Holy Ghost there. just so we can have some variety. No, those men were moved of the Holy Ghost to write it that way. &gt;&gt; They used it knowingly. They recognize a distinction between manifestations. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Even if you read Bible dictionaries like maybe Strong's concordance, it's going to tell you that John the Baptist began to speak. I've read it there. That's why I'm telling you John the Baptist began to speak of a change of dispensation of the Holy Spirit. Okay. So also if we believe that the Holy Spirit in Do you believe the Holy Spirit inspired men to write the Bible? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You do that all the scriptures are divinely inspired? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So if you believe that do you think that where they wrote Holy Spirit they made a mistake? Do you think that where they wrote Holy Ghost, they made a mistake? Do you think they they they wrote it there just to be um to have variety or was it purposeful? Well, of course, it's purposeful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So, if we believe that that is the way it was written, I want to tell you I find no fault in the way the Bible was translated. &gt;&gt; Zero. I'm so sold out to my Bible and the message. I believe everything brother Ben Baron says. I know why he said that. In the day that he said that, those two quotes, I know why he said that. And yet I look at all the other thousands of quotes where he uses the words differently and I see ministers take them and confuse them and teach it falsely to the children. So if we believe that right to me the Bible is perfect as it is. I don't want to change anything. It is just us that makes the different interpretation by our private understandings. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So when you read the scriptures, right? Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit is used in in if if if uh you know it's used in any Bible verse interchangeably uh but they are two different words. Does it really strike you as absolutely interchangeable and there's no significance when the word Holy Spirit is used s so many times? I mean if you just sit and think about it logically, Holy Spirit is used only seven times. Holy Ghost is used 89 times. You do not find significant numbers like that without purpose. &gt;&gt; All right. If you have become someone oblivious to the change in manifestation of the Holy Spirit like if you say there's no there's no difference right Holy Spirit from old testament to new testament it just changed you know they just decided to change it so right let's let's start with this are you with me &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; why would brother Brandham say the following things let's go to the next quote okay uh question and answers on Hebrews where this go too. Yeah, that's the one. Question answers in Hebrews. Are you all with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he's reading. If you read Ephesians 4:30 right quick, you'll find out what the seal of the living God is. Ephesians 4:30. Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption, not till the next revival, but got eternal security. Now those of you who heard the message I preached in North America when I said uh you are not sealed by the gifts &gt;&gt; till the day of your redemption. You are sealed by the person. &gt;&gt; That's what I was pointing to. Right? So you're sealed until the day of your redemption because how why because brother says you can have the gifts 24 hours in a day and go to hell. How can the same man using it interchangeably say that you can have the Holy Ghost 24 hours in a day and go to hell and then you are sealed by the Holy Ghost till the day of your redemption? &gt;&gt; That's a direct contradiction. They think the man is nuts. &gt;&gt; Obviously, it's not a contradiction because he knows what he's saying, &gt;&gt; right? Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption. See if Ephesians 4:30 doesn't say that. Then take your margin readings and run it all. In other words, look at your concordance. Run all the rest way through the scriptures there and find out. Sealed until the day of your redemption. In other words, he's telling you, go look in your margins and go go study the Bible. &gt;&gt; Right? Okay. This is what I want to bring you to paragraph 51. Now, remember, the Holy Ghost was not taught as the baptism of the Holy Ghost until after World War I. The Holy Ghost was not taught as the baptism of the Holy Ghost until after World War I. He's literally telling us when the church changed the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the gifts to be the person. He's telling you that happened after World War I. That never happened before. &gt;&gt; But I'm saying to you, these are the things I study. He's the one pointing me to this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; How about the masterpiece? The masterpiece message. Brother Mike, can you move it for me? Notice here the life that was in the husk in the stalk and the tassel in the husk all gathers in the seed. The life was in the stalk went one went to make the other. Justification made a way for sanctification. Sanctification made a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Are you ready for this? The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost itself &gt;&gt; to come. What is that now? &gt;&gt; To come right down in perfection. Now what is the purpose of the Holy Ghost itself? Back to the word again to manifest itself. &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost was a different manifestation &gt;&gt; that makes way for the person to manifest the word itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. to manifest itself by the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; he says that. &gt;&gt; Let's read resume of the of the church ages. We learn the most amazing truth that the Holy Spirit could and would fall upon the unregenerate false vine Christians. Are you hearing? &gt;&gt; That the Holy Spirit would fall upon everyone. &gt;&gt; Yes. unregenerate false vine Christians and manifest powerfully in various signs and wonders. Here's the issue. Message ministers today across the world are trying to take us back to that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When we already know the warning in scripture is that's what they're going to do in the false church. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Manifest powerfully in various signs and wonders. Even as Judas had a definite ministry in the Holy Ghost though now Judas wasn't there in the upper room. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is he talking about? &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost only came in the upper room, how was Judas in the ministry of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; He himself was pronounced a devil. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, what was Judas in the ministry of? The person or the gift and answers part three, paragraph 63. Now, if I taught it like that, people would reach out and get a hold of that without having what that that person's got. See? All right. Here it is. The Holy Ghost does speak with tongues, but you've got to have the Holy Ghost first before it can speak with tongues. Now you get it. And I bet you nobody did. If you reach out and get a hold of a gift of speaking in tonesues without Now if you if you know how the prophet speaks, he's saying if you get a reach out and get a a hold of speaking in tonesues without having the Holy Ghost first. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is he talking about? &gt;&gt; If you're speaking with tongues without having the person &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. you have problems. &gt;&gt; In other words, it's very possible to speak in tongues without having the person &gt;&gt; because the gifts falls on the just and the unjust. &gt;&gt; But the person is given to the elect. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; I want our young people to desire the person. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And then let the gifts follow. &gt;&gt; The way it's been taught is get the gifts and that's the person. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now remember that can be brother is saying that can be a genuine gift. I'm reading that could be the Holy Ghost speaking in you with unknown tongues and you'd be lost and go to hell. &gt;&gt; The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; Now these are the thousands of quotes I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right now. Now, now I'm telling you, if you if you say this, if you read this, how are you interpreting this as a young person who's coming up in the message? This is exactly what I get asked at youth camps, brother Alistister, how do I know I have the Holy Ghost? What does the Holy Ghost do for me? How is it a Why is it so necessary? Why are they shouting and screaming at us to get the Holy Ghost, but you could have the Holy Ghost and still go to hell? So says, "You believe that? Would you like to have scripture in that? You want scripture? Raise your hand. Though I speak with tongues of men and of angels, you know that. Uh though I have no charity, I am nothing." See, unless that goes with it, you can have this. You can have the gifts. You don't reach after that without this. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm asking you who are not in the service and reading it in books and listening to the tapes, do you know what he's saying? You can have this and don't reach after that without this. What is he saying? &gt;&gt; You need to know what he's saying. &gt;&gt; He says, "Get this first and that'll actually follow it." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's the right way to teach it. Get the person and then the gifts will follow. &gt;&gt; Where the gifts are necessary. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what do they teach now in message camps? Shout, scream, faint emotions and you got it. &gt;&gt; And then you come back to the next camp. Repeat process. What did he mean? Get the Holy Ghost first before it can speak with tongues. Okay. The next quote from leadership. The choice of your conduct. You can mix it now. You're either for God or against God. And the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside. the cockleber. Many of you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm going to heaven. That don't mean one thing. You're going to heaven. No sir. What is he saying people? If I have the Holy Ghost, why am I not going to heaven? Brother Alistister, what do you mean? What is he talking about? The gift, not the person. &gt;&gt; You can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell. But then he says future home paragraph 111 see the heart has to be cleansed. Now this is young people this is what I want this is what I want to get you to and we'll talk more about this at the end but the heart has to be cleansed like that he says before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart. What is the person of the Holy Ghost is Christ coming down and dwelling in the human heart. This is not gifts. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Agreed. Okay. Fundamental foundation for the faith. Last quote there before we get moving on that Jesus had some power. Let's say it that way. Let's just say it that way. Jesus's redeemer to redeem us back to what we was before Adam's transgression when he was here on earth as an example son of God from the first indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Wake up. Don't miss it. This is the quote where brother Bram says that Jesus was the first example son of God who had the first indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Which means all those previous of the Old Testament had an anointing. &gt;&gt; They did not have the indwelling. &gt;&gt; Christ had the indwelling and he was now going to bring sons like him. which means the dispensation was changing. &gt;&gt; It was not going to be the same. There was now going to be accompanied with gifts and indwelling. &gt;&gt; That means they were going to receive um maybe Peter already had some indwelling. Maybe John had some indwelling. Maybe the indwelling was going to take place at different stage. They but they would receive the gifts in Acts chapter 2 and they would receive an indwelling as compared with others. &gt;&gt; From the Old Testament who only had the anointing upon their lives. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Other men were do you agree? He says this that he was the first indwelling of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; First example son of God. Glory to God. You love him, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, knowing this, I put this already in our service, but I'm doing this again next uh scripture. Let's go to the scripture. John 7:39. Now, are you all with us? Let's let's break this down clearly. But this spake he of the spirit which they believe they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given. This is spoken in John 7:39. The Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified. That's telling you the ho like basically what it's saying is the Holy Ghost was going to be given after Jesus was glorified. When you say that and you say when was Jesus glorified, you say well he was glorified maybe after he rose again and and ascended. So the Holy Ghost was only given after that. Do you agree? Okay. So why did Jesus do this? John 20. And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said, "Receive you the Holy Ghost. Whosoever sins you remit, they are remitted unto them. And whosoever sins you retain, they are retained." Why did he also uh give the Holy Ghost to the 70 and send them off healing and casting out devils before Acts chapter 2? Why did Mary and Elizabeth, the Bible says, filled with the Holy Ghost? Mary filled with the Holy Ghost produced a child. Elizabeth filled with the Holy Ghost produced a child. Zecharias filled with the Holy Ghost before the Holy Ghost came. See, this is the reason our children and so many people are confused about whether they have the Holy Ghost or not. Because I and I began when I preached in America saying with the quote brother Baron says to to have the Holy Ghost you need to know what it is. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What it is for your day. &gt;&gt; You need to know what results it brings. &gt;&gt; When it comes you have to believe that it's for you. So he says when you know what it is and you believe that it's for you and you know what results it is it brings then you know what you've got when you get it. &gt;&gt; That's the quote I use that as the foundation for what I preach there. This is the whole thing. This is the reason our children are being confused by all these conflicting ideas about what the Holy Ghost is, what the Holy Spirit is. and it's being slapped around as if you should just know what it is. Nobody tells them that holy means dedicated to the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That holy means dedicated to what God has provided the provided way for worship for your day. And if you are holy, it means you are committed to that worship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Instead, they speak about holy as if it is your life that must be clean. Brother man said you must be clean before you get it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't get clean by it. &gt;&gt; Going to come to that for those of you who don't understand. Amen. So they are asking why the gift our children are asking why the gifts of tongues and prophecies have diminished. I was literally asked that question before I left here. before I left for the United States. Brother Al, why are the gifts and prophecies diminishing in the churches? Why do we not see them anymore in Message Churches? They are so much in Pentecostal churches. Why are we not seeing them? And some one of part of the question was in some churches they have almost disappeared and some people who are faithful believers are not even healed when they are prayed for. I got this question before I left for the United States. Don't sidetrack it. What excuse are you going to be given for some faithful brother has cancer and he's not healed of it and he dies? And most of the time the ones who are dying are those absolutely faithful faultless people. And people are asking but they were men of great faith. We prayed for them. They prayed. Why do they die? Don't sidetrack. You need to have an answer. &gt;&gt; And don't give confusing answers to the young people. They're watching you. So like I said to you before and I say to the young people and to my own children, you have to have a rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to have a foundation. Right? When I said to you a few weeks ago, you have to have an anchor in your soul to go back to when things get hard to understand when you're reading the message and the scriptures. When you have problems with the scriptures on the Godhead, what is your rock? Your rock is there is only one God. &gt;&gt; That means no matter what you read, you must come back to there is one God. Amen. &gt;&gt; One Lord. You shall have no other god beside me. There's no three people. There's no one throne for the father and another throne for the son and sharing this. No, you your rock must be there is one god. That means when you read the scripture and he said uh and Jesus prayed to the father, you come back to this rock. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't make it two. Remember one god. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to have a rock. Settle that rock and everything else fits into it. Right. So when you look at the issue of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit. What is the Holy Spirit and why should there be any contention about it? Do you even know what it is? Is the father a spirit? Yes. Brother Baron said God the father is a spirit. He said God uh the son is a man who the spirit of God dwelt in. That's a literal quote. He said we all know that. He also said the father is the holy spirit. They are the self same thing. And he also said the holy ghost is Jesus's father. &gt;&gt; Quote twice. Said it twice. This is what I'm saying to you. If you don't teach this right, your children are going to be thoroughly confused. &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, &gt;&gt; if they're the same. Holy Father is a spirit. Holy Spirit is a spirit. And you just stop there. They are spirits. Let's all blow balloons and have a party. They're spirits. No. What is a holy spirit? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that means it's related to man. It's given to man so he could be holy. Holy means set apart for the purpose of God. Yes, &gt;&gt; it's very different to the spirit that existed through all space and time before everything. It's a different manifestation of the same person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you must know, you don't just say one is the spirit, the other spirit is the same thing. &gt;&gt; That's delusional. Okay. So, why not just call the Holy Spirit the father if they're the same thing? If they're interchangeable. If brother said there's a self same thing, why not just call the holy spirit the father? Why make a distinction? What is your rock on this? If you don't know this, what is the point of arguing this? Right? What the what the Holy Ghost is and what the Holy Spirit is. Okay, I want to come to this part. Evidence. So, here's the other thing. There's this whole argument about evidence, the evidence of the Holy Ghost. The evidence of the Holy Ghost. You must have the evidence. You must have That is nonsense. &gt;&gt; Okay? If you have if you need evidence to know that you're a believer, you missed the boat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't need evidence. I am a believer. &gt;&gt; The fact that I believe is my evidence. &gt;&gt; I don't need signs or some other kind of thing to tell me who I am. I am a believer. That's where it starts. &gt;&gt; My soul is sold out to him. My soul loves him with all of its being, with all of its essence. That's what I know. I don't need signs, wonders, or anything to confirm that to me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what then is the Holy Ghost an evidence of? Right. Let's read. This will shock you out of your boots if you're wearing them. There it is. Peran church age. You can't claim that manifestation is the evidence of being spiritborn or spiritfilled. No sir, I will admit that true manifestation is the evidence of the Holy Spirit doing mighty acts, but it is not the evidence of the individual being spiritfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though that individual has an abundance of those manifestations, the evidence, some of you who have concentration problems, trust me, I'm going to explain it to you now. The evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost today is just the same as it was in the days of our Lord. Reading on, he says it is, what is the evidence? If there is, it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live. That's what I have. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I receive it gladly. I believe it 100%. There isn't a fraction of resentment in me towards the word of God preached by the messenger throughout the Bible or anything the history. I love it so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Jesus reading on he says Jesus never did stress the importance of the works &gt;&gt; as he did the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; He knew that if the people got the word the works would follow. &gt;&gt; That is Bible. Okay. So for those who lost concentration in that first part, I'm going to explain this to you. He's saying the gifts of the Holy Ghost are for vindicating the word, not to you. &gt;&gt; It's not to vindicate to you that you are a believer. So I'm saying to you young people, that's not the proof. If you go to youth camps and they make you shout, scream, fall on the floor, and act good actors like you fainted and the Holy Spirit came and they fan the flames, fan the flames, fan the flames, the heat, and then you you fall down and you have some vibration and epileptic fit and you act like the Holy Spirit hit you. When you get up again, you better live your life so clean. Otherwise, I'm coming after you. &gt;&gt; Because if you claim that's your experience, you're in trouble, &gt;&gt; right? But that isn't that is an anointing. That anointing, brother said, can happen. We know it. We see it here in Africa. You got a bunch of people marching through the streets. Uh they're all shouting the same thing in Zulu and they're shouting against some kind of of a political party or they shouting kill the farmer, kill the bur, whatever it is and they're moving and they're all in lock step. That's exactly like a church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They're focused. They've got someone telling them the word. What is the word? We hate the government. Hate this party. Hate. Right. They've got that. It's being repeated to them and they're singing and they're moving and they're singing and they're moving. Normally, if they do that for two minutes, it's okay. They Okay, let's go home. But if you do that for half an hour, &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; and add dehydration and heat &gt;&gt; and fatigue, it goes into a spiritual state. Something else takes over. Another spirit takes over. one or two of them or more go into a trance. They get so inspired by this constant repetition and this beat and this drumming and this motion and emotion. They start jumping and screaming and spinning and shouting. And I'm looking at this and I'm thinking that's exactly what I see in a Pentecostal church &gt;&gt; after they stretch it for too long. That will happen to any human who has red blood and gray cells in his brain box. Why? You can do that. You can do that. You know what I'd love to see in all these fantastic churches all over the world? Take away all their music. Take away their drums, bass, guitar, piano, organ. Sing without it. And let's see how much spirit you got. &gt;&gt; You're flat. You got nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's what it is. What? Something creating your anointing. you you know you got somebody speaking there on the speaker and you hear the drums going &gt;&gt; and a keyboard doing something. What do you think that's doing to impressionable young people and you're telling them that's the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; That's gifts of music working up their tender spirits to fall prey to emotions and sensations. &gt;&gt; We know it. We see it here in Africa. You can't fool us with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It happens at every political rally here. They literally lose their minds. They'll be going through our streets here in Durban. The next thing you know, some of the zealots just think, "Oh, I love MMA so much. Take a break. Throw it in the window. Feels so good. Windows broken." Another guy said, "Wow's broken. Let's go in and take something." Yes, that is an anointing. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what anointings do. &gt;&gt; And then you'll have the people coming up on the TV screen and say there were a few rascals there. They do not represent the party. &gt;&gt; You riled them up. &gt;&gt; You gave them the anointing. You made them do that. They do not represent us. We do not stand for violence. Of course, you stand for violence. You riled them up. You You made the slogans. You sang the songs. You made them jump. You made them stand in the heat. You made them gathered together. You know what happens? Take one person from Pentecostal church, leave him all by himself in a building and get the spirit now. That's it. Come on, let's go get the spirit. No, but when you got a group of people together and we're shoulderto-shoulder and we're moving in lock step and we're moving in lock step and then suddenly I'm feeling good because you're with me, you're with me, we're together, we're in this, we're soldiers, we're ready to fight. Let the enemy come. Take all of them out and leave you by yourself. You're like one shadow and you're like, what happened to the soldier who was going to take out the enemy? Yeah, &gt;&gt; I've seen it. I grew up in it. I know the Pentecostal church. I was lifted up on a bed by a demon-possessed girl &gt;&gt; when I was 4 years old. I've seen all this stuff already. I've seen the people speak with tongues and have all the miracles. You want to take us back to that confusion? See, that's what it brings. One is a visible manifestation to vindicate the word and the other is the person that brings the purpose. Mary, Elizabeth and Zachariah were filled with the Holy Ghost and brought forth purpose. Mary, Elizabeth, and and Zechariah did not speak with tongues or prophesy. &gt;&gt; They brought forth babies and fulfilled that the Messiah confirmed that the Messiah was there. &gt;&gt; They did not act like Acts chapter 2, but they were filled with the Holy Ghost. The Bible says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; There's a difference. See, I accept that the Holy Ghost in that in that section is speaking of the person bringing a specific ability that has to do with purpose. On the other side, it was the vindication of the word. What was Acts chapter 2? To vindicate. In other words, Peter, James, John, all these men of the disciples, they were coming out and going to the world and they were going to say, "Jesus of Nazareth came in our day. He's the savior of all all the world. He died and rose again." And the Gentiles are saying, "Oh, yeah. Prove it." What? You don't have a scripture? You don't have other holy men. So, do you see what those gifts were for? To prove their message that had no proof. Acts chapter 2 was supposed to be the vindication of a message when they had no proof. &gt;&gt; But for the individual, they had to have the person to produce their own individual purpose. &gt;&gt; The gifts over the church is not for you. It's for another person. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Why would if somebody spoke in tongues here in our church today and a prophecy came most likely that occurred because somebody here is new or was not believing and that came to vindicate the word to that person. That's why the gifts are necessary. But if you got everybody in the church a seasoned believer, the elect of God, the bride of Christ, married to the word, what do we need to vindicate the word for? You each have the vindication within yourself. &gt;&gt; You have the person within yourself directing you to the truth. &gt;&gt; So the confusion I want to tell you there will always be confusion on what the prophet said on many things. If there's no confusion on before 63 and after 63, confusion on the seventh seal being opened or not, confusion on Daniel 70 weeks, whether it's 7 years or whether it's three and a half years. There's always confusion. &gt;&gt; I'm to answer the question on brother Al. How do we navigate through this without causing confusion? Sorry, can't help you there. You need revelation on the word. There are confusing things all over the message. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; confusion occurs because of lack of revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; lack of understanding. The prophet said that many people don't receive the Holy Ghost because of lack of teaching. And yeah, &gt;&gt; you remember he said, he said, "You old-timers remember before I get a person baptized, I teach them so that when they are baptized, they receive the Holy Ghost." He said, "A lot of people come, they get baptized and don't receive the Holy Ghost." Why? Because they were not sufficiently taught. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So by focusing on the confusion of the things he said, the prophet uses the ch the phrases Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost interchangeably. If our conclusion is the phrases are just the same, then you are not being taught right. So I'm going to spell it out for you. Are you all ready for this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. When the prophet says you are sealed by the Holy Ghost or the Holy Spirit, he used it interchangeably till the day of your redemption. He is not talking about the anointing. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the person, &gt;&gt; the indwelling. When he says you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and still be lost or the Holy Spirit and still be lost, he is not talking about the person. &gt;&gt; He's talking about the anointing. When he says you can speak in tonesues and not have the Holy Ghost, he says that in trying to do God a service. You can speak in tonesues and not have the Holy Ghost. He means you do not have the person of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's all we are saying, right? in and and that brings us to the most important thing when he says the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost is the dynamics. Is it the anointing or the person? &gt;&gt; This is what's being pushed today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is the dynamics that puts life to the mechanics? We know this. This came from the seventh under seven virtues movement. It's already been tried and failed. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. They teach the exact same thing that men are resurrecting today. Tried and failed. What happened? We saw it. They went hallelujah. Praise. There isn't even a single church in America with all their noise that comes close to the seven virtues movement here in South Africa. &gt;&gt; When they are shouting and screaming in the church, you cannot hear yourself think. That's how much the more you tell them about anointing, it's so loud. They're standing here in front. You're preaching. They're standing in front waving their arms in your face, shouting amen, screaming, running, jumping all over the place. They did it. And what happened to the churches? They fell. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Very badly in immoralities. Terrible. Why? You've got passion and zeal out of control. no wisdom. They fell. Young people went astray. You literally cannot get young people anymore to even qualify for elders to be pastors, preachers, deacons because they messed up their life so bad in the same movement. Whatever you are being taught is going to determine your experience and your victory. Right? This is why I care so much about it because I'm concerned for our young people. I'm concerned for our people. I don't want you to be misled. I mean, what does it matter what I want? To me, I feel like it's the Holy Spirit in me that wants that. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what my brain thinks. I am moved to to say these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. The seven thunders, seven virtues movement taught that it was the anointing that brings shouting, charisma and atmosphere. And they flogged that horse till it died. &gt;&gt; So if it isn't then what is it? If you are not clear on what it is when the prophet speaks of it of it, how it is spoken of in the Bible, then you are going to remain in a state of ignorance and forever you will lack identity. If you don't know what the Holy Spirit is, what the Holy Ghost is, if you don't know what it is, if you don't know what results it brings, if you don't believe it's for you, you will lack identity. Young people, forever in the message, you will just be a piece of driftwood drifting through churches having no power in you whatsoever. Let's go to question two. because you said and I quote, so this is I'm reading the question, the word is what your soul is married to, but this animal meaning the body needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So I just want to point out this is somebody giving me an actual quote that I spoke of in the message while I preach. So I'm glad this is because I want people to see I am not against the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I believe in it. I believe you need gifts. I believe you need power. Baptism of the Holy Ghost is power for purpose. &gt;&gt; Ability which you did not have before. Right? So I said this animal needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I mean in order to live a purposeful life. So this person, this young person is saying I believe without a shadow of doubt that my soul is married to I love to hear this. I love to hear things like this from young people. I believe that without a shadow of doubt that my soul is married to the word which also would make me believe that I have received the person of the Holy Ghost because I have received the open book. That's what I want to hear, right? But the question, can a person receive the person of the Holy Ghost before the baptism of the Holy Ghost? See, that's why I love question and answers. This is a wonderful sincere question and I think it's amazing that young people can ask such questions while adults are still stumbling over themselves. To answer this question simply but not to make a doctrine out of it. I will say look at the types and the things the prophet said. He said you must believe first before you receive the Holy Ghost. Because Paul asked the question, have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed? He made the statement because many people were manifesting gifts in the Leodysian Pentecostal age and yet not believing in the word of the prophet. They had gifts. They were they were preaching. They were speaking with tongues. They were prophesying but they were rejecting the prophet's message. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So I believe that what has happened after Pentecost is that God flipped it around. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the bride had to remain in a barren state. You had to receive the seed first. So before Pentecost was receiving the rain, gifts, gifts, gifts, gifts, and then God had to bring them to to the prophet's message. Now we got the prophet's message first &gt;&gt; and then the ability follows. &gt;&gt; Then the work follows. We remained in the state of barrenness while the seed was being planted and the womb was being opened. The womb was being opened by the word being revealed. &gt;&gt; So we received the person first. We were married to him first and then the ability falls. And the ability is specific. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So that was a private affair. This and and you can put it all in with the word coming to us, opening up our womb, making us fertile, taking away the baroness is what? Not a public show. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the third pull coming to sons. &gt;&gt; Nobody knows what it is. Nobody can identify. Nobody can tell you. You've got the Holy Ghost. You've got the Holy Ghost. This is the Holy Ghost. Nobody can tell you. It's not a public affair. So different to Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So then according to Revelations 10:8-11, look look at the process there. And I like this because this is what the the the the the young person is asked. If you look at Revelations 10:8-11, what is it? Take the book first, eat the book, then prophesy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? In Pentecost was prophesy first, then search for the book somewhere. Right? Look at the process. Eat the book. Digest it. It will be sweet in your mouth, bitter in your belly. Now go and prophesy. &gt;&gt; There it is. Get the person. Go to the angel uh who who has the book in his hand. Take the book. There it is. Right. Brother literally spoke like he was speaking to different people in his ministry. On the one hand, he would tell people, "Clean up your lives and make sure you live right and keep the law of the word." And then on the other hand, he will say to another group of people, don't worry about that. Just believe the word and those things will sort them out. &gt;&gt; What is important to understand is that the human body is a beast &gt;&gt; that comes by sexual desire. It does not have natural abil. In other words, your body is saints, young people, your body naturally does not want to keep the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It wants to feed its face. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. It wants to feed its own lust and its own desires. Your body is selfish. It wants to do its own thing. It does not want have a desire to be holy. Holy means to follow the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But when you receive the Holy Spirit, then you get that movement inside to say, I want to be different. &gt;&gt; I want to follow the word. I want to worship this way. I want to be at this church. I want to be at uh in this place in my life. You cannot do that without the gift of the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is in the soul is the person of the Holy Ghost. God gives the body ability by the baptism. But what is in the soul is the person. &gt;&gt; In the past uh they receive the word not in its fullness. So when they believe the fullness of the word uh when we believe the fullness of the word we receive the fullness of the person. In the past in Luther's day he received the person with measure. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Luther received the person with measure. He still had major gifts, right? You know, come to think of it, before I left for the states, my little boy was asking me, so and I'm just thinking I we got message ministers here asking us to repeat the first the the the first age. They want to take us back to the apostolic age. Actually, I know all the quotes, right? Brother Ram said, "Every age is an apostolic age." I get that. You know what I'm talking about. They want to take us back to the book of Acts and they want us to go back there and they they keep saying we but I say to them there's a whole lot more that to the book of Acts than just shouting, jumping around, screaming, speaking with tongues and prophesying. There's a whole lot. Your church must change. Don't go take tithes like you do. Then split all the stuff. &gt;&gt; Spread it out. You want to go back to the book of Acts? Let's do it the way it was. Brother M says the book of Acts had so many errors. The church had so many errors and those errors were going to be amplified through the church ages until it reached complete blackout. &gt;&gt; Why do we want to go back to the church there which had so many errors? And we're the bride. We're not going back to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right. So, what I'm saying to you is in Luther's day, he had that much word and he had person the person that he had in himself was according to was proportional to the amount of word that he had. &gt;&gt; Yes. So he had the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He had the person, but he was also a trinitarian, a German who loved his beer and smoked a pipe. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You try that today. &gt;&gt; You can't do that today when you have the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we have a scripture that tells us that without us they cannot be made perfect. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Having the fullness of the person then brings abilities to the body. We have to reflect maturity and purpose. It will not be the same in the ages past when people did not possess the fullness of the word. And here's the thing. You have a scripture that tells you that when that which is perfect is come, that which in part is done away with. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's literally telling you once you have the full person and you are married to the person, you are not dependent upon gifts to vindicate the word for your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not that you are not going to have gifts. You are going to have gifts in its season for a particular purpose. You're not going to be running around rampant with gifts just randomly expressing themselves. Okay. Question three. Can you have the Holy Spirit on the body, spirit and soul? This is a complex question. Once again, you really need to understand what Holy Spirit is. Uh, and because it's it's complicated because of how people interpret Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; right? So, if you say Holy Spirit is the same as Holy Ghost is the same as baptism of the Holy Ghost, you can only have the baptism on the body and the spirit. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the person is for the soul. Just like we were saying as we close off the last question, the body is an animal and the animal requires ability. The Holy Ghost anointing gives ability to the body and the spirit because the body and the spirit has senses, &gt;&gt; has emotions. It's subject to sensation. It needs ability. But the soul is not emotions. It's not sensations. Right? The person of the Holy Ghost is received in the soul. Remember in Ezekiel 36 where it says, "I will give you a new spirit." Yes, &gt;&gt; that's a new nature. That's your spirit being changed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes you a better person, a more likable person, a person that is more committed to the the worship of God. That's what it's doing for you. But then he says, I will give you my spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will put my spirit within you. And this is specific. It doesn't say I will put my spirit within you and make you prophesy and do great deeds and and and and um heal people and do great miracles in the world. No, it says I will put my spirit in you that you will keep my commandments &gt;&gt; and follow my ways. &gt;&gt; That's the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what you want, young people. That is the person of the Holy Ghost. Just a quote to verify that. I don't like doing this but you know notice now women they want to have bobbed hair they will wear shorts paint makeup these little bikinis and things they that's not important they were wear nowadays they want to do it and yet they want to go to church you see that anointing upon the spirit not upon the soul &gt;&gt; means people in other words he's telling you you are dressing out of character because it's not in your soul &gt;&gt; but you're you think you're proving to yourself you got an anointing on the body and the spirit but you but not in the soul. See the soul has to have the person. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go to question four as we close. So I love this. This is the question where it all comes out in the open. Okay. In the youth meetings you said holy ghost meetings are not going to cut it. So, who are these youth services meant to help? I think that that meant the youth services I preach in Canada. Who are they meant to help? Are they meant to help youth without the Holy Spirit or youth with the Holy Spirit? Fascinating question because youth with the Holy Spirit, what does that tell you? If if you hear this the phrase youth with the Holy Spirit, what does that tell you? What do you think of anybody? What do you think of youth who got their lives together? Youth who are living straight? Youth who who have no sexual problems. They have no problems with lust. They're just mute, immune, and sexually dead. Youth with the Holy Spirit, they've got themselves in control, man. Right? What are we saying? I'm just putting it to you in a in a very humor humoristic way so that we can break it down further. But this is true. This is a good question. Who are these youth services meant to help? Youth with the Holy Spirit or youth without the Holy Spirit? I like the question because further on the next part of it says, are you saying that these young people who struggle with fornication that is any legal sexual act as you put it don't have the Holy Spirit? If that's the case, why not teach getting the Holy Spirit as the answer? That's a good question. Are you saying even with the new birth people can have these struggles? Answer is yes. &gt;&gt; I wasn't clear on that. As you can imagine, we are caught between these. So here this brother is he's from North America. He's telling me that we are caught between two groups. One says just get the Holy Spirit versus you need more than just getting the Holy Spirit. Okay, see that this is a beautiful question or a set of questions which I know comes I know the person comes from a good heart of concern a wonderful young man in today's churches we are concerned about the condition of our young people we see them going to youth meetings now this is why I have preached it the way I've preached it and why I wanted to bring a distinction between the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and what results they bring. You've got to know carefully. You can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and still go to hell. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But if you have the person, you're elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Is that the word? Is that what we've been through? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So, what I want for our young people is to get the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I know if they get the person, they get the baptism. &gt;&gt; Amen. No. &gt;&gt; Right now, I'm going to tell you, here's what happens at youth meetings worldwide. Youth go to meetings. They go to conventions. They go to camps. They go through motions of being called. Every single youth meeting and and and camp, there is an altar call. You know what's an altter call? They call you to the front. They ask you to repent. They ask you to make your life right. Whole bunch of old ministers with big bellies come out and pray for you. and pass on their gifts of whatever it is to you and pray for you and shake the living daylights out of you and then you leave that place with emotions thinking I got saved you know I had a feeling I had a sensation now I'm not saying that some people are not saved at that time but many people feel they have an experience right and they seem as if they are repenting crying going through emotions confessing ing their wrongs, rejoicing with deliverance, but then they come back the next year, repeat. &gt;&gt; Next youth meeting, repeat. Many are disillusioned and defeated, not knowing what to make of their experience. And then you've got youth who are sitting there who have the person feeling bad, being made to feel bad, like they are not going to the front. They are they are being told you are unworthy. You have stuff in your life. You can't deal with it. You need to be here. If you're not here, if you missed the Holy Ghost call right now, you're going to be lost. Am I right, young people? Yeah. That's exactly what happens. Many are disillusioned and defeated not knowing what to make of their experience and simply do not know whether they have the Holy Ghost or not. They are living in a state of constant confusion. I I've opened myself up to questions from everywhere, right? And it all comes back. There are so many ministers who think everything's great, everything's fantastic. The youth, the youth are literally bluffing you in that they don't want to talk to you because they know you're going to make them repeat. &gt;&gt; Right? Let me explain to you what happens, right? Let's read future home. This is the quote we read before but I want to bring you back to before I highlighted the middle portion. Now I'm highlighting this part. Brother said the heart has to be cleansed like that before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart. It must be repented. It must be baptized in water in his name to show what it belongs to. Right here it is. Young people, if you're going to show a commitment to God, you got to clean up your act. And it doesn't take supernatural to clean it up. It takes responsibility. Clean up your act. Stop doing that. How must I do it? Just stop it. If I tell you stop standing, what do you do? You sit down. It's that simple. No, but it's so hard. you know, I'm going to Yeah, it's so hard cuz you still want to do it. Do stuff. Show commitment. Clean up your act. Come to church. Read your Bible. Become active in the church. Show some uh uh commitment. Clean up your act. That doesn't need revelation. &gt;&gt; Dressing right does not need revelation. Speaking right does not need revelation. Not having a weird hairstyle does not need revelation. You don't need a baptism of the Holy Ghost to make you do all that. You can do that without the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What has been happening to young people at what they call Holy Ghost meetings is that they are introduced to the anointing by charismatic preaching. &gt;&gt; Right? And I'm going to explain to you the effects. I just told you what happens here in Africa with we have we have anointing in abundance. We don't have finances in abundance. We have anointing in abundance. Everywhere you go there is an anointed church. I mean it's miracles. It's signs, wonders, dreams, visions. It's it's Corinthians on steroids. That's what we have in Africa and in message churches in Africa. Okay. The anointing, listen carefully, affects the senses and can cause you to feel sorry for the things you've done. Okay? If a if a charismatic preacher comes here and he's preaching about Christ and the blood and salvation and the wrongs that you do and he doesn't have much notes, but he's laboring on that repetition. Repetition, repetition. And he goes on for an hour, an hour and a half. He's badgering the spirit and crushing it and badgering it. And your little spirit inside is crumbling. Crumbling. It's taking a hit. It's taking a hit. With a person who loves the word, it's going to work. With a person who's still fragile, it's going to crush them. &gt;&gt; And here's what happened. you if you're a normal person and you got struggles in your life, there be sexual issues, lustful desires, whatever, you are going to feel sorry. No normal person will sit there and think, "Yeah, well, I'm just going to do what I got to do. I don't care what you say. Normal person is going to feel sorry. You're going to bow your head. It's going to show in your body. You're going to put your hands together. You're going to sit like that. You're going to you're going to take on a very nervous posture. You're going to be putting your head down. Your face is going to look like this. And you're going to be doing this and you're going to be saying sincerely, Lord, help me. Please forgive me for what I did last week. I really want to change. Lord, this is what's going to happen. You are naturally going to feel sorry for the things you've done, right? And that's why they keep coming back from experience to experience, but no repentance. What is repentance? Repentance is not feeling sorry for yourself. Repentance is having a change of mind. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the reason why our elders keep doing this and this is what is in the question the brother has asked me. Shouldn't we preach the Holy Spirit as a solution? Why do our elders from the previous generation keep doing that? Because our elders came from the world. They came from messed up sexual lives. They were drinkers. They were drug addicts. They were smokers. They swore the worst language. They dressed in shorts and tank tops and naked running on the beach. They did all that. They were in pubs and clubs and parties and script joints and you name it. Our elders did it. And they came to the message and they transformed &gt;&gt; from that to this &gt;&gt; right and they saw it work for them. The Holy Ghost smashed it. &gt;&gt; Smashed their lives. They cut out from it. They dressed themselves up. They shaved themselves. They cleaned themselves. They put on the right hairstyle. They put on the right clothes. They came into the presence sanctified and ready to be filled. and they received it. What's the difference? All your young people have not experienced that. They are brought up in the message. They live under holy atmosphere. They live under correct teaching. They live being brought up straight. They live with godly parents. They are not brought up with worldly music in the home, with television, with horrible dressing. They are brought up. They are literally perfect little children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you want them to have an experience you had. &gt;&gt; What do you want them to repent from? They actually already believe the word. They're not like you. You came from Methodist Catholic. You've got to undo Trinity. They don't have to undo Trinity. They don't have to undo abuse of the Holy Ghost by Pentecost. They don't have to undo Lutheranism. They don't have to undo Episcopalianism. They don't have to undo anything of that. What do you want them to repent from? Or repent from your lustful ways or repent from your bad thoughts. You know what that does? That's telling the youth, you ministers, do not have lustful thoughts. &gt;&gt; You walk around like you don't enjoy sex. You're a liar. &gt;&gt; That's right. You walk around like you don't have any bad thoughts. So these young people who are there, you want them to repent from what? Change their minds from what? &gt;&gt; These young people brought up in the message need &gt;&gt; repentance from self-righteousness of having lived a message life already and failing by it because they're active. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the That's what you need to be preaching to them. But you want to talk about wrongs that they did. And you're teaching them wrong things. I'm going to prove it to you. They are already believing. They have never been a part of denominations or believed in false doctrines. They grow up believing the prophet. They know nobody else but the prophet. If repentance is a change of mind, what change of mind do you expect them to have? What the elders don't understand is that they are living under this environment of the message from the time you are a child makes. Now listen to this. If you are living under the environment of the perfect the perfect word, the perfect anointing, the perfect church, the perfect people, do you realize every single wrong thought you have is a transgression as high as the highest building in the world. You never went through that. At Holy Ghost meetings, it's preached in a way that brings condemnation. So after they feel like they have received the Holy Ghost because they went through a sensation, they go back home. Glory to God. I've been transformed. I've been changed. I felt it in the meeting. I I cried my heart out. They laid hands on me. I feel so good. It's a sensation. &gt;&gt; Yes. They go back home. They fall again. They become disoriented and disillusioned. Now after falling, after the experience, what has happened in the experience? They had been told after receiving the Holy Ghost, if they fell again willfully, they are lost. &gt;&gt; So why would they want to confess again after they fell? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Instead, we have a whole lot of use of loose living with struggles, unable to help themselves and unable to find the victory. What has happened is many of them have become good actors and they just do it to please their parents and their elders in church while they're living a double life. What happened? They left the youth meeting. They brought in front by the minister to give a testimony. This person has received the Holy Ghost. We've baptized them. They submitted their lives to the Lord Jesus Christ. The parents are beaming like they got a scroll in the ward. The parents testify and cry, "Mom, I'm so happy my child has been saved." The child is watching all this. 2 weeks later, the child is stuck in pornography again. Now the child after all that testimony, the pomp and grandeur in church, the display in church, do you think that child's ever going to confess again? &gt;&gt; No. And this is what happened because these children talk to me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; they literally said, "Brother Allah, I've crossed the line. I cannot talk to my parents. I cannot talk to my pastor. I'm in trouble. What do I do? What do I do?" They've been told after receiving the Holy Ghost, if they fall willfully, they're lost. So all this is because of lack of solid teaching and lack of this is why when I preach at brother Duncan's place I I read the quotes of brother said as long as he's calling out to you and you feel the the need in you you haven't lost your salvation you've lost the joy of your salvation. &gt;&gt; Look at the contrast of how brother Bham teaches this under a Holy Ghost dispensation as compared with message churches and what they're doing today. Let's read church and its condition. That's what's the matter. People don't receive the Holy Ghost when they're baptized. They just don't thoroughly repent. Young people, we need to thoroughly repent. You if you you need to come to God and know, Lord, I've been an actor. I have godly parents. I've been living this life, but I don't know what what's going on. I don't know the difference between anything. I've been listening to the word. I've been enjoying the motions, but I want a committed life. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. &gt;&gt; That's where you ought to be, right? But look what's happen. He says, "You need to thoroughly repent." Listen, saints. He says, "God's trying to give them the Holy Ghost." What does he want? He wants you to be meek and gentle and quiet. That's not jumping, shouting, screaming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; He wants you to be meek and gentle and quiet. He wants to give them the Holy Ghost. What does he want to give them? Not the gifts, the person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the reason you get up with that same selfishness in your heart. He says, "Or you might get up." Now, here's what I'm telling you. Here's what he's telling you. Sorry. shouting, speaking in tongues, or anything that wouldn't make you have the Holy Ghost. You've got to get up there a different person. You got to get up there gentle, quiet, meek, humble, God's spirit dwelling with you. Next year, you look down the trail and see how far you've come. See, you're gaining ground all the time. &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Spirit. Yes. &gt;&gt; This idea of motion after emotion and sensation after sensation, camp to camp, meeting to meeting. Listen, young people, you only have 5 to 10 years of being a young person. Bad news. After you're a certain age and you're married, no more youth camps. From there on, you're struggling with the same things while you are married and no longer a youth. The Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, meekness, gentleness, patience, faith. Why don't they teach that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I was having a chat, Brother Chad, and I I like what he said. He said, "Nobody preaches the other gifts of the Holy Ghost like wisdom and knowledge." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like saying, "We want to see those gifts." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's right. You never hear that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Why? because they themselves, those ministries don't even have the wisdom and knowledge to pass it on to the young people. They ask them a question and they say, "Get the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham did not encourage rowdiness and sensations to receive the Holy Ghost. One of the one of the most telling things in the Bible and the message is did you ever hear brother Bham act like that? Do you ever see Jesus act like that? Like what this acting that goes on here in Africa in the churches, you do not see that in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And think the the pillar of fire was in the in those meetings. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Those with the pillar of fire in those meetings, they didn't act like what you see happening. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Now what? We have something greater &gt;&gt; than the pillar of fire. You've got brother so and so who's got a voice that can make the building tremble. I'm sorry I can't stand it anymore. &gt;&gt; This begs the question, how do you teach young people who have grown up in the message to repent? What must they repent from? If repentance is a change of mind, what change of mind are you talking about? The elders of the past thought repentance was confessing wrongs like unrighteous things. These children believe the word. They dress right. They listen to the right ministry. They sing the right songs. They are obedient because they are not being taught how to receive the Holy Spirit under the dispensation. They are falling to unrighteous living and immorality. And this is confusing the elders. The elders are doing everything they know that worked for them and it's not working. That's right. &gt;&gt; Just because some youth bluff you, stay in your youth camp, stay in your youth meetings, eventually find someone to marry, get married, have a job, come to church and support you, doesn't mean you had the victory. &gt;&gt; They're still living double lives. &gt;&gt; It is a big cause. The elders only know how they were they repented with a first and second pole ministry. Yeah, &gt;&gt; the elders don't know what it is to repent under a third pole ministry. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. &gt;&gt; We know. &gt;&gt; We grew up under it. &gt;&gt; That's where I came in from. &gt;&gt; I repented under a thirdpool ministry. I know what it takes. &gt;&gt; See, so they feel that it's going to work again for the children and that these young people will be brought to repentance by first and second pole. They believe they must go back to that process because they believe justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost that makes way for the person. So let's go back. In other words, you message people have a creed. Correct? &gt;&gt; First and second ministries are not going to bring young people to repentance today. They need to be brought to the open book. &gt;&gt; They need to be brought to the love of the word. You preaching like Pentecostals is not making them love the word. It's making them love religion and love church. &gt;&gt; They they will have uh if you bring them to the open book, they will feel freedom. They will not feel caged. They will not feel restricted. They will be an adopted son. They will have victory. They will have the power to take control of their own vessels. They will receive the ability of the Holy Ghost to achieve particular purpose in their life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; In other words, they need to be taught right. They need to be taught love of the word in a bright age. No, they're not in an age where there's a little bit of light. We're not in Leodosia. The light is shining bright. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's so bright it exposes us when we don't even know it. That's where our young people are. Not the love of church or anointing from a previous age. Spiritual amnesia. We're almost done. This is the last quote and we close. You that wants the Holy Spirit, you want that. You want You that wants that experience, not an emotional excitement. You want the Holy Ghost, the life, the germ of life inside you. And you want to get rid of that amnesia that's making you can't identify yourself. You don't know where you stand. You don't know what you are. Let's get rid of it right now. There is a new birth here for you. a real genuine new birth. All right? We cannot make them feel that if they get the Holy Ghost for today, they will be perfect and never make mistakes. That's a lie. That's a problem. That's what they're selling. You you these young people have young people problems. Young people problems primarily has to do with sexuality. The moment you bash their thing, they're done for. There's literally some young people saying it's a sin. We are not allowed to like it. I went to I spoke to a minister. This is amazing. Minister told me, "Brother Alistister, you need to come and speak to our people. I'm having a serious problem." He says, "I married two young people and they went on their honeymoon and they came back and they did not consummate the marriage." And he asked them, "What's the problem?" He says, "Well, the first night we sat on our bed and we prayed, Lord, we are about to partake of the sin of the Garden of Eden. Please forgive us." And their bodies couldn't function. How did they become so deluded? There are literally young people who believe that sexuality is sinful. It's not the original way. It's not the perfect will of God. We we must actually become so dead to it and that's when we'll be perfect. The Bible proves that wrong. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Did Moses have the Holy Spirit? &gt;&gt; Prophet like unto Moses. Christ is called prophet like Moses had the Holy Spirit. He had the anointing of God on him and God wanted to kill him. Abraham was anointed with the spirit of God and lied to save his own life. Where do I stand, Lord? Oh, Saul had the spirit of God upon him. Most people remember Saul for all the troubles he gave David. &gt;&gt; Go and read the chapters before David comes in the scene and see how great Saul was. You literally have verses where it said the spirit of God was upon Saul. &gt;&gt; There's it ru &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit was upon Saul and Saul did great things. He and Samuel I can't imagine. You can imagine this this terribly tall Benjamite with his massive sword and shield and and armor and this this gayhead prophet standing next to him with a wind blowing and theatrical music playing standing there taken out of Malachites. What a great movie that'll make. Hey, what I'm saying to can you imagine with the spirit of God how great go read it Saul's stories he was he had the spirit of God on him and then he became the man who had demon spurts on him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says Balam had the spirit of God on him when he prophesied. Balam was a false prophet &gt;&gt; with a true gift. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Okay. Sexuality. H. Was the spirit of God upon Samson while he was sleeping with a Philistine prostitute? Yes. The spirit only left him when he cut his hair. You mean the Holy Spirit? Yes. Was on Samson while he was having an affair. He was supposed to be married to another Philistine, which he shouldn't have been doing. And then that Holy Spirit got on Samson and he went and killed people, stole their coats, and burnt people's fields. How about us? You're teaching people that the Holy Spirit is going to take away all desire for sexuality, that you're going to be faultless after you get the Holy Ghost, that you are never going to be a person who will ever have any desire for your wife or your husband. Is the Holy Ghost going to make you numb and take it all away? No, my friend. You're going to struggle with that till the day you go in the rapture &gt;&gt; in a translation. Yeah, the Holy Spirit, I'm sorry, is not a quick fix for all those things. They, if they told you that, they lied to you. Samson had the spirit of God on him while he was in the bed of a Philistine harlot. I could go on and on all through the Bible. So what is the Holy Spirit about? It's about the purpose of God being fulfilled. &gt;&gt; It doesn't care about who you are. It's going to use you, your faults, your mistakes, your issues. It's as long as you've got that person, you are going to keep moving on. You're going to have struggles. You're going to have backslideness. You're going to fall. You're going to wake up. You're going to fall. You're going to wake up. But if you don't have the word, you're lost. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can have anointings. You can bluff yourself that you keep in rules. You can bluff yourself all you want to and say you're clean. And the ministers who do that, shame on you for making those young people believe that you're just some sinless person without any faults, without any feelings, without any desires or lust or anything to make them feel like you're that great person and they are diminished before your eyes. You should never preach the gospel that way. Brother Brandham did not do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a difference between having the spirit of God upon you and having the spirit of God within you. Ultimately, the third pull ministry in this message has come to put the spirit of God in his people. In his people. We're not interested in God above us anymore. God with us anymore. We want God within us. &gt;&gt; That's what I want. Something inside me, not something just upon me. I don't mind. Something upon me will help me since I'm really bad times. I'll admit, but God within me is going to make me endure to the end. &gt;&gt; So to answer the question, when we teach the mystery, those meetings I had in brother Don's place, the mystery of sexuality to our children, we're telling them the truth. &gt;&gt; You are a biological animal. You are facing trials. You are facing problems in your life. You are going to struggle with this all the way through. After you get the Holy Ghost, after you baptize, after you committed yourselves to the word, you need power of the word to get personal victory. &gt;&gt; We're teaching them the power of the word. We want them to come to love the word. We're not teaching them if you stay in church, if you get the anointing, you'll be safe. That you fell. You see, you know why you fell? Cuz you left the church. You know why you fell? Because no, you fell before you left the church. &gt;&gt; See, we're not teaching them to depend upon an anointing to keep them safe. We are not teaching them abstinence as a form of strength. We are teaching them that true strength is knowing your weakness and knowing what you face in this world and understanding that it is the character of the word that saves you. A church without power without character is &gt;&gt; but power with character. I I want character &gt;&gt; and then if the power comes to me that power is under control. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not teaching the Holy Ghost as a solution to your problems. We are teaching the Holy Spirit as being the love of your lives. You should love the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Spirit? The spirit of God in me that directs me to worship him &gt;&gt; in the way it has been revealed for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's the That's what the Holy Spirit is. If I don't have the Holy Spirit, then I want to go to college. I want to go to university. I want to go somewhere. I want to follow my ambitions. I don't care about the people of God. I don't care about what I do. I don't care if I live irresponsibly. I'm not interested in what they think about the message. I'm not interested in embarrassing my parents. That shows you don't have the Holy Spirit. But a child who has the Holy Spirit and is going through similar struggles and still comes back, that shows me he has the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; I can work with him. He loves the word. He'll come back to me. Brother L, I have this question. I have this question. Please explain this to me in the word. That's already telling me this boy has the Holy Spirit. This girl has the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because they have been channeled to holiness to set apartness. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There are plenty of of those who you know use in the message with ability. They worship plenty of youth in the message with ability. Okay? If there's one thing about our youth in the message, they have ability. They can sing like angels. They have musical talent. They can read the message and quote the message and they have ability. They can talk to people, right? They these youth worship. They sing songs. They testify and they still backslide. This is not exclusively to youth. Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, it's it's pointless standing here when you're 50 years old and your testosterone is failing you so that you no longer are having as many lustful thoughts as a 16year-old and condemning them for being young. &gt;&gt; That's being hypocritical because as us ministers get older, we get shut down. We're literally losing our testosterone from the time we 40, &gt;&gt; which means we're becoming less sexually active, our thoughts. In fact, if you try to make me watch a movie, I'm going to fall asleep in 5 minutes. A movie is not even a trap for me. If you make me listen to music, I'm thinking about my light bulb. Am I shut this shut the song off? I don't even want to hear it. I'm not even trapped by music. It's because I'm not youth anymore. and you're standing there preaching like you want them to be like you while their testosterone is at 400%. &gt;&gt; So nowadays this issue of singing songs, worshiping, testifying and backsliding is not exclusive to youth because the older people are falling into this as well. Yeah, &gt;&gt; this is happening more and more even to parents and they're not admitting it because they're stuck in the same place. They can't confess it. They can't admit it because they're ashamed to do so because they're afraid what the church will do to them. There's a lot of ability going around which comes from the Holy Ghost anointing. Listen saints, the what the message that we have, the message of the hour is so powerful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I I cannot even give you a measure of how powerful it is. This message has turned simpletons like myself into what people call a teacher. I am embarrassed. This this message has turned simpletons around this country into great speakers. &gt;&gt; People who had stutters and people were rejected in society are now recognized names all over the world. &gt;&gt; That's how powerful this thing is. This thing will turn your young people into philosophers. It's got that much ability in it. But what is needed here today people is the love for the person of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is going to make the difference young people. In closing, that is what the prophet preached. I don't serve him legally. I serve him because I love him. &gt;&gt; And I do not do wrong things because I love him. And because I love him, if I do make a mistake, I am quick to repent and I make it right knowing that he has already forgiven me. &gt;&gt; And that I can never be lost. &gt;&gt; That's my position. That's the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the rest of the stuff, it's noise. Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit, quote this, quote that, this quote, that quote. It's noise. It is. It's noise. And people are going to go on about this. It's going to go across the world. It's going to But it's doing its purpose like it did when we preached the seven sealers open. We were crushed. We were smashed because other people were coming through with thunders and virtues and Peruia and this this uh type of thing for the coming. They rejected us. Brother Steve was preaching the opening of the seventh seal in the 80s. Brother Steve was preaching the cloud 28 minutes in the 80s and we were crushed for it. We remember the days when friends turned their backs on us and yet today they're believing it. Why? What? What happened? It made them go look at it. It made them turn it out. It made them study it. It made them question. It made them fight with one another. And then they open up their hearts. Same thing happened with the return ministry with the third pull. Same thing happened with with the open book now in this day with the coming with revelations 10 with all these things. It's got to come out. It's got to make questions. It's got to make turmoil before it eventually brings the elect in. Amen. That's what we're looking forward to. In the meantime, God keep us humble. Man, we who are we? We're just we're just people the same as everybody with the same faults, same issues. We need to be corrected. We we don't have it correct all the time. Uh in fact, I think most of the time we need a lot of correction. I I tell you people, you know, sometimes you're you got you get so used to teaching you got barely any emotion. You need to get some emotion. And yet some of you have tremendous amount of emotion and I love your worship, right? But I mean sometimes I wish some of you would get a bit loose jointed every now and then. &gt;&gt; Could help. But um you know this is how the word works with us. We're going to learn from one another. God's going to adjust us. God's going to change us. Never get stuck in thinking you're perfect. &gt;&gt; There is no perfection of the flesh. &gt;&gt; There's perfection of the spirit, perfection of the soul. You've got that. But your flesh can always be adjusted. Your dressing can always be better. Your hairstyle can always be better. Your speech can always be better. Your conduct can always be better. And we want to get there. We want to be the best that we can be. And if it's going to take the Holy Spirit to change us, let's submit to him. &gt;&gt; Let's let him take over. Let's let him take control. And let's let him allow that word to change us and transform us. The Lord bless you. Let's bow our heads together.
