[14:08] [Music]
[14:09] Heavenly Father, how wonderful it is to
[14:12] be in your presence
[14:15] with saints of light, precious faith.
[14:18] Lord, worshiping before your holy name.
[14:22] Your name is our identification.
[14:26] Your name is our strength in this time.
[14:30] Your bride is the group of people that
[14:32] know the true name of the Lord in this
[14:35] day. And we have the authority
[14:39] by that name to speak the word in this
[14:42] time. Lord, we receive your word. We
[14:46] worship you through it. Lord, you have
[14:48] revealed the secrets of the universe to
[14:50] us. You have revealed your purpose and
[14:53] your plan for the ages for of time. You
[14:57] have revealed all things to us, Lord,
[14:59] through the name of God revealed in
[15:01] these last days. How thankful we are,
[15:04] Lord, that we are your people. How
[15:06] grateful we are, Lord, for your
[15:09] revelation that you have sent in this
[15:11] day.
[15:13] We can never thank you enough, Father
[15:15] God, for the blood of Calvary, for
[15:18] washing our sin away, for bringing us
[15:21] true repentance by your word,
[15:24] and so much more, Lord, for the word
[15:27] that you sent by a humble prophet in
[15:29] this last day. Lord, he spoke amidst
[15:34] great persecution
[15:36] and turmoil and trouble. And even to
[15:39] this day, they are blackening his
[15:42] reputation
[15:44] and speaking against the word that was
[15:46] spoken. Yet he spoke with zeal and
[15:50] fervor and great inspiration,
[15:53] not even knowing those who would come
[15:56] and receive that word.
[15:59] He didn't even know us.
[16:02] He didn't even know who we would be and
[16:04] what our lives would be,
[16:06] Lord. But you put your spirit within him
[16:09] to speak the message, Lord, that has
[16:12] drawn us from all corners of the earth
[16:15] and brought us together and made us a
[16:17] family and made us friends, made us
[16:22] benefit from one another and given us
[16:25] joy and peace in our lives and
[16:28] transformed our families and took us out
[16:30] of the mess of this world.
[16:34] What a privilege it is, Lord. We are so
[16:37] thankful for the blood of Calvary and
[16:39] the message of the hour. Our lives are
[16:42] meaningless and empty without it, oh
[16:44] God. And we give you all the praise and
[16:46] the glory and the honor for it. Lord, we
[16:49] welcome you among us this morning. Lord,
[16:54] may you bless us today with your word.
[16:57] I'm just mortal man full of faults and
[17:00] failures and full of my own thoughts.
[17:04] Lord, I I ask you that you would purge
[17:07] my mind of all my own thoughts that your
[17:11] thoughts may be expressed to your people
[17:13] today.
[17:14] Bless the pastor and the people of this
[17:17] congregation.
[17:20] May this time that we spend together,
[17:22] Lord, be one step closer to that
[17:26] glorious translation,
[17:28] that glorious body change which this
[17:31] creature is groaning for. Father God,
[17:34] may you undertake for every need.
[17:37] Lord, we have a great task today. We
[17:41] have a a world that is teetering on the
[17:45] edge of
[17:47] destruction.
[17:49] People are succumbing to madness and
[17:53] strife and it looks like everything
[17:56] around us is they're losing their minds.
[17:59] They don't know what is reality anymore.
[18:02] It is becoming more and more difficult
[18:05] to
[18:07] get through to the spirit of man to
[18:09] change his mind about something to to
[18:12] let them see what reality and truth is.
[18:16] And yet in this time you have placed us
[18:21] Lord with your word. What can we do?
[18:25] What can we say? What can we teach that
[18:28] is so convincing that can permeate the
[18:31] hardened spirit of man? How can we
[18:34] change
[18:36] liberal and legal people,
[18:39] Lord, who have made up their minds about
[18:41] life and about marriage and about family
[18:44] and about politics and about God, about
[18:49] whether you exist or not? How can we
[18:51] change them? How can we affect them?
[18:54] Is our purpose, Lord, just to be a
[18:56] church that just keeps going on and on,
[18:59] having services and song specials and
[19:02] song services and prayer meetings or is
[19:07] there something more that you want us to
[19:09] do? Is there something more that you
[19:12] have called us for? Is there something
[19:13] more that our lives are meant to
[19:16] achieve?
[19:17] Lord, we bring ourselves to you today
[19:20] willing to be instructed,
[19:23] willing to be taught, willing to be
[19:24] corrected, willing to be anointed of
[19:28] you. Lord God, we pray that you may
[19:32] bless all
[19:35] your children gathering in the different
[19:37] churches today in this country. All
[19:41] waiting to hear from you. all
[19:45] wanting to hear one word of life from
[19:47] you. We pray that you may anoint your
[19:49] bride this morning. Bless all the
[19:52] saints. Bless the saints back home
[19:55] in Durban, South Africa. Lord Jesus, may
[19:58] you be with our people as well. Father,
[20:00] we are truly thankful for you this this
[20:04] day and we ask you to be with us. Open
[20:06] up the scriptures to us. Open up your
[20:08] word. Lord, without your spirit, we
[20:11] cannot understand anything. And we
[20:13] depend upon you in all things. As we
[20:16] worship you now and submit and our souls
[20:20] bowing down before you, we welcome you
[20:22] among us. Speak, Lord, for we are
[20:26] willing to listen. We ask it in your
[20:28] precious name with thanksgiving and
[20:30] praise. Amen and amen.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:35] Amen. We like to greet you in the
[20:36] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[20:38] Jesus Christ.
[20:40] It's certainly good to be with you. I
[20:42] think that's what I was looking for.
[20:45] And um
[20:48] you may take your seats for a few
[20:49] minutes
[20:51] uh before we read the word of God. I
[20:54] just want to make sure I say all the
[20:55] relevant things.
[20:58] So, I just uh am so grateful to God to
[21:03] have this uh opportunity to be here with
[21:06] you once again and to uh share the word
[21:09] of God with you as he has um uh inspired
[21:13] us. You know, we we don't have anything
[21:15] new to say. Uh but we have something
[21:19] that God places on our heart that we can
[21:21] share with every one of you. And I know
[21:23] that each one of us has something to
[21:26] share. And that's why we're here today
[21:28] uh in this world in 2025. And God has
[21:32] anointed us. God has given us uh uh his
[21:36] word. He has anointed us with his
[21:38] spirit. He has given us revelation and
[21:40] understanding and uh we have a
[21:42] responsibility to it.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I just once again just happy to
[21:47] be here with you and good to see all of
[21:50] you again. I'm I'm thankful. Brother
[21:52] Chad told me, "You know what? You're
[21:54] part of the furniture now, so there's no
[21:57] need for me to come before you." And I
[22:00] appreciate that. Makes me feel so much
[22:02] better. Amen. So, I see a few years ago,
[22:06] it was 2022, I looked at the audience
[22:08] and I could just see faces I I didn't
[22:10] know. Now, it's all just friends. Amen.
[22:13] And I really certainly appreciate you.
[22:16] You know, it's uh it's always easier to
[22:20] preach to people who um know the word of
[22:24] God, who are well taught, people who are
[22:26] hungry for the word and um and I
[22:29] certainly appreciate your spirit and the
[22:32] worship uh always. It's really a
[22:35] blessing to me and I appreciate your
[22:37] pastor. He is a he's an inspiration
[22:41] uh not just to me but many people around
[22:43] the world and it's a it's a difficult
[22:45] time as I was praying there are many
[22:48] people in need people in the message um
[22:52] people um facing different trials you
[22:55] you you may not realize it um I must say
[23:00] Lima is a little bit of a utopia
[23:04] um I I mean if you come and live in our
[23:07] city. It's uh it's completely different.
[23:11] It's it's a rat race. It's uh so busy.
[23:15] The houses are all squashed nearby and
[23:18] uh you know it's there's crime. Uh here
[23:22] it looks like heaven.
[23:24] You're just driving through things are
[23:25] so peaceful
[23:27] you know. So I struggle to to find out
[23:30] how you people have desperation for the
[23:32] rapture.
[23:35] So,
[23:36] it's so calm. It's so peaceful. Time
[23:39] just goes by slowly. Uh, and the sun
[23:42] sets so late, you don't even know it's
[23:44] 9:00, it's 10:00, what's happening? And,
[23:47] uh, but with us, uh, even the birds
[23:50] remind us, go to sleep now. You know,
[23:52] it's, um, it's a different terrain and,
[23:55] uh, different, uh, places have different
[23:57] struggles and trials. I understand. And
[24:00] so um when I when I come here it's it's
[24:04] always so relaxing and I certainly
[24:06] appreciate everything that you do. Um so
[24:09] yeah, we appreciate the ministry here
[24:11] and all our friends and uh and I
[24:14] consider you the family of God. So the
[24:17] Lord bless you.
[24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I want to um let you stand
[24:23] again as we just read the word of God.
[24:27] Just want to make sure I
[24:29] I'm getting it right. Yeah.
[24:32] We're going to read from Hebrews chapter
[24:34] 9 and verse 8.
[24:38] Says, "The Holy Ghost, this signifying
[24:42] that the way into the holiest of all was
[24:45] not yet made manifest,
[24:48] while the first tabernacle was yet
[24:52] standing." I'll read it again. the Holy
[24:55] Ghost. This signifying that the way into
[24:58] the holiest of all, was not yet made
[25:01] manifest. While as the first tabernacle
[25:04] was yet standing, did you ever think
[25:07] that that's what the Holy Ghost was
[25:09] signifying?
[25:12] &gt;&gt; That the way into the holiest, Did the
[25:14] Holy Ghost make it known to us that the
[25:17] way into the holiest of all was not yet
[25:19] made manifest?
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. While as the first tabernacle was
[25:25] yet standing, in other words, it's
[25:26] telling us
[25:28] and it's pointing to that that the Holy
[25:30] Ghost that came in our day, it was
[25:32] actual proof to us that before the Holy
[25:35] Ghost came, there was no way into the
[25:37] holiest of holies.
[25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; That tells us what the Holy Ghost
[25:41] truthfully is.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. You may be seated.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[25:51] uh this is might terrify some of you for
[25:53] a little bit.
[25:55] I am going to take a subject called the
[25:58] Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost.
[26:01] Hold that thought. Let it digest and
[26:05] we're going to get through it. And for a
[26:08] title, the purposeful nature. Amen. So
[26:13] when we read this scripture,
[26:16] uh Paul tells us that the Holy Ghost's
[26:19] coming after Christ proved to us that
[26:22] while the tabernacle of Moses was still
[26:24] in operation, the way into the holiest
[26:27] of holies was not yet revealed.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Amen.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; It was not made known. There was no
[26:33] access.
[26:35] So the reason for me preaching um this
[26:38] subject this morning, you know, coming
[26:40] here, I tussled with it. I struggled
[26:44] with it right up to last night. I was
[26:47] should I shouldn't I, you know, and and
[26:50] struggling through it and putting things
[26:51] in the right places, but I just couldn't
[26:54] get it out of me because I I've I've
[26:57] preached certain things uh in the recent
[27:00] years and I spoke about in different
[27:03] places. I spoke about the Holy Ghost,
[27:05] the types of the Holy Ghost when they
[27:07] came out of Egypt and the type of the
[27:08] Holy Ghost when they went into the
[27:10] promised land and how there was a an
[27:13] infancy baptism and then a mature
[27:15] baptism and the rolling away the
[27:18] reproach of of Egypt at Gilgal and
[27:21] showing the difference between the
[27:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost in Pentecost
[27:25] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[27:26] the seventh seal. And uh it you know I
[27:30] just expected people to say amen. We get
[27:34] that. And it seems like when you touch
[27:38] the Holy Ghost, it's a very sensitive
[27:40] spot for people. And um my main uh
[27:45] concern,
[27:46] well, you know, I say that it's my main
[27:48] concern. I mean, but who am I? I just
[27:51] feel like the Lord is feeling what is in
[27:55] the hearts of the people. And that's
[27:56] probably why it feels like it's my
[27:58] concern, you know. So I I keep hearing
[28:03] questions from the young people and as
[28:06] of lately from older people who I would
[28:09] have considered to have known where they
[28:11] stand uh saying, "Brother Alistister,
[28:14] how do I know I have the Holy Ghost? um
[28:18] how do I know whether
[28:20] you know whether I have the Holy Ghost
[28:23] from Pentecost or whe I had the Holy
[28:24] Ghost under the seventh seal? What am I
[28:26] supposed to be doing? Is there a
[28:28] difference? Am I supposed to be acting
[28:30] different? And so to me that is what I
[28:33] feel is something that should be um made
[28:37] clear and I I really care about the
[28:41] young people and I believe they are the
[28:42] church of tomorrow, the next generation.
[28:45] I also believe that when the word says
[28:48] we must keep his commandments, the word
[28:51] keep means to preserve, which means to
[28:55] pass it on.
[28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how you preserve it. You
[28:58] make sure it goes to the next generation
[29:01] that it continues. Keep it for a
[29:03] perpetual covenant from for your
[29:05] children and your children's children
[29:06] and so on. So it really fails us if we
[29:11] become people who take an idea of the
[29:14] Holy Ghost given to us by Pentecost and
[29:17] then pass that down to our children and
[29:19] then we see it's ineffective.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; And then what happens is our children
[29:23] meet people, they go to youth camps,
[29:25] they go to youth meetings and we find
[29:27] there's this tradition of trying to
[29:31] force young people to get something
[29:35] &gt;&gt; and they leave more confused. or they
[29:38] keep coming back and they are forced to
[29:39] be doing the same thing again and again.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; And uh I feel like being the bride of
[29:45] the Lord Jesus Christ there needs we
[29:48] need to be the people with direction
[29:51] &gt;&gt; with understanding. We need to be the
[29:53] people who can have a solid foundation
[29:55] to say this is what it is.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; And I'm not afraid to say what it is.
[30:00] And I'm I'm not hindered by somebody
[30:02] trying to make me feel inferior or
[30:05] somebody trying to make me feel like I
[30:07] don't know what I have. And so that is
[30:10] the reason why it's so impressing on me
[30:13] to make this clear to the bride of
[30:16] Christ and to let us know because this
[30:18] is something so personal to us. The Holy
[30:20] Spirit is something so personal to us.
[30:24] When you understand who he is, what it
[30:27] is, you wouldn't you wouldn't want to
[30:29] live a second without him.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; So, knowing this that the Holy Ghost
[30:36] signified
[30:38] that before
[30:40] Christ, the way to God was not made
[30:44] manifest. Well, that's simply telling us
[30:47] something important. The Holy Ghost has
[30:49] made the way possible.
[30:51] &gt;&gt; Right? That's the first thing we need to
[30:53] know.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; To do what?
[30:56] Right? So, knowing this and that it made
[30:59] the way possible, it sparks so many
[31:01] questions. Questions that stem from the
[31:04] things we were previously taught of the
[31:06] Holy Ghost and things we have been uh we
[31:09] have heard since we came into the
[31:10] message.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I believe that uh the trouble
[31:15] in this subject can can come simply from
[31:17] trying to make sense of the scriptures
[31:20] and the message. And it's like if you've
[31:23] got these scriptures and the statements
[31:25] brother Baron makes in the message like
[31:27] you got these uh uh the one quote way it
[31:29] says the dynamics is the Holy Spirit and
[31:33] look where that went to
[31:35] &gt;&gt; right the mechanics is this and the
[31:36] dynamics is the Holy Spirit and people
[31:39] took that and started teaching things
[31:41] and it expanded into people trying to
[31:44] express what they thought the dynamics
[31:46] is.
[31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[31:48] &gt;&gt; So I believe that the trouble comes from
[31:52] trying to make sense of the scriptures
[31:54] and the message and the statements.
[31:57] Well, that's the trouble with almost any
[31:58] subject,
[31:59] &gt;&gt; right? So we know that the prophet says
[32:03] that God interprets his own word. Now
[32:05] listen to the story. You know that,
[32:07] right? God is an interpreter of his own
[32:09] word. And there's an understanding to be
[32:11] had with this,
[32:13] &gt;&gt; right? Does this mean that we have
[32:15] nothing to say?
[32:17] that I'm just somebody who stands here
[32:19] and and like some supernatural being
[32:22] takes over me and God interprets his
[32:24] word like I'm not even conscious of what
[32:27] I'm saying or that u these hand gestures
[32:30] that I keep doing are him controlling me
[32:34] that he interprets his own word. No, he
[32:37] interprets his word within us. And
[32:39] here's the amazing thing that the
[32:41] scripture says that in the mouth of two
[32:44] or three,
[32:45] &gt;&gt; amen,
[32:45] &gt;&gt; let it be established.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Why would he even do that? And it always
[32:50] worked that way. You you know the
[32:52] scripture that says where two or three
[32:54] are gathered in my name, there am I in
[32:56] their midst.
[32:57] &gt;&gt; You know what that means, right? That
[32:59] doesn't mean just because more than
[33:00] three are here that God is here. There
[33:03] are many people who are gathering in the
[33:05] name of Jesus Christ and God is not
[33:07] there.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's not what it means. That
[33:09] scripture specifically means that
[33:12] anything is established as long as two
[33:14] or three in with the spirit of God agree
[33:17] on it
[33:19] &gt;&gt; right from the law right through. That's
[33:21] what it means. Let u by the witness of
[33:25] two or three, let it be established.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:28] &gt;&gt; Now, why would he do that?
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Why would there have to be two or three?
[33:32] What's wrong with just having one person
[33:34] who has the Holy Ghost say something and
[33:36] because the Holy Ghost said it, let it
[33:38] be established.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Because to people there needs to be a
[33:42] witness of two or three to see that they
[33:44] are seeing the same thing. Therefore,
[33:46] they can believe it.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; And that in itself is showing us that it
[33:50] is not a foolproof way. Foolproof,
[33:53] terrible word,
[33:55] right?
[33:56] man can men can so easily get people to
[34:00] follow their own interpretation.
[34:03] So if let's look at this way. If two or
[34:05] three people agree on the wrong thing
[34:09] &gt;&gt; and say they have the Holy Ghost
[34:11] &gt;&gt; then because the church has manipulated
[34:14] that law
[34:15] &gt;&gt; it's established.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[34:18] &gt;&gt; This is why I say it isn't foolproof and
[34:20] yet God instituted it that way.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Right? So the way it works is if a man
[34:27] has the Holy Ghost then he has the
[34:29] witness in himself.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. that the word spoken by the
[34:34] preacher was interpreted by God or not.
[34:38] Which then happens to you when you hear
[34:39] the preacher speaking, you have a
[34:42] witness in yourself and you hear that
[34:44] word and you decide based on what he's
[34:47] telling you to say amen or not.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Right? So the Holy Ghost then settles
[34:54] the word in that man and makes him say
[34:57] amen to the to the confirming of the
[35:00] interpretation of the word.
[35:02] That is God being his own interpreter.
[35:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:06] &gt;&gt; True.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; Right. Not
[35:08] &gt;&gt; and this is why we get so uh criticized
[35:12] when we say something because some
[35:15] people are going to doubt now. Is he
[35:16] saying that with the Holy Spirit? Is he
[35:19] interpreting that by himself? Is it his
[35:21] own thoughts, own interpretation? The
[35:24] only way it can be established is if you
[35:26] have the Holy Spirit and you can say
[35:29] amen to that. And then when there's more
[35:33] than one that have the Holy Spirit that
[35:35] say amen to it, then what was said is
[35:37] established.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; If a man does not have the Holy Ghost,
[35:42] it will be the opposite. Or he may
[35:44] choose to believe it and say amen based
[35:47] on his understanding because he's saying
[35:50] amen because it's a church tradition and
[35:52] he says amen because it makes sense to
[35:55] him, not necessarily that the Holy
[35:58] Spirit confirmed that. Yeah.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Do you see how precarious this is?
[36:02] &gt;&gt; How dangerous it is and how this has
[36:05] been passed down for generations? People
[36:07] saying amen because it makes sense.
[36:09] People saying amen because they like it.
[36:11] People say amen because it's convenient.
[36:14] But there needs to be this is the
[36:16] purpose or the reason why it's crucial
[36:18] that we all have the Holy Spirit
[36:21] &gt;&gt; because then things can actually be
[36:23] established
[36:25] &gt;&gt; properly established.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So true believers
[36:30] have to stay as true to the word as they
[36:33] can. And that's what we're coming to in
[36:36] this little subject. And we've got to
[36:38] believe that God will interpret his word
[36:40] within them. We literally walk around by
[36:43] faith. I greet you. I shake your hand.
[36:45] You shake my hand. You say, "God bless
[36:47] you, brother." We fellowship together.
[36:49] Sometimes we fellowship together to test
[36:51] each other, right? You know, are we on
[36:54] the same page? Do we have the same
[36:56] spirit? We're testing each other all the
[36:58] time. But it it makes fellowship so
[37:00] sweet, so beautiful when our spirits
[37:02] connect.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Do you know that um you are first a
[37:08] spiritual being before you are a
[37:09] natural? So like when you're walking
[37:12] towards somebody and uh before they even
[37:15] speak a word, before you shake hands,
[37:16] you already your spirits have already
[37:18] connected.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; As he's coming towards say, "Oh, he's
[37:22] having a bad day."
[37:24] You already know you he's not happy to
[37:27] see me right now. He'd rather not be
[37:28] here. And then you shake hands and you
[37:30] both say, "God bless you, brother,
[37:33] but your spirits are already connected
[37:36] &gt;&gt; and already communicated and your body's
[37:39] just acting out something for the sake
[37:40] of peace or something." But this is this
[37:43] is exactly what happens. So without the
[37:46] Holy Spirit between two people, there
[37:48] can never really be peace.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the other thing. It is
[37:53] the peace of God.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's move on. So, when
[37:57] we look at the scriptures on the Holy
[37:59] Ghost, as we approach the subject, we
[38:01] must realize that we are stepping into
[38:03] dangerous territory. I like dangerous
[38:06] territory because I like that God can
[38:09] lead us through it.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I'm not afraid of it,
[38:12] especially in a day like this. But the
[38:15] carefulness that is needed is where we
[38:17] need the guide,
[38:19] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit. We also have to bear in
[38:21] mind that you know when we are speaking
[38:24] of this you know peoples of the world
[38:26] have been delving into this mystery long
[38:28] before any of us were born
[38:32] right we literally are Johnny come
[38:33] lately no offense to any Johnny's around
[38:36] &gt;&gt; right but we are literally I I didn't
[38:38] make up these phrases brother Johnny
[38:42] that's what they call did Johnny come
[38:44] lately we have just arrived yet there
[38:47] are people who have lived through the
[38:49] the the seven church ages, the time when
[38:52] the Holy Ghost poured out. Before that,
[38:54] there were the the great prophets and
[38:56] sages and they lived through this time.
[38:59] They studied it. They asked the
[39:00] questions. They wrote things. We've we
[39:03] are we are arriving here and
[39:05] piggybacking of what those people have
[39:07] been through. Yeah.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; And and sometimes it's so, you know,
[39:12] amazing for me when I when I listen to
[39:14] ministers who who stand there so
[39:16] aggressively saying this is what it is
[39:18] and there's no other way but the way I
[39:20] have said it and yet there are thousands
[39:23] of generations of people who brought it
[39:25] up for you to receive it today.
[39:28] &gt;&gt; Let's be cognizant of that. Amen.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; So most ancient religions have believed
[39:34] in the spirit of God. Do
[39:38] &gt;&gt; you know that?
[39:39] &gt;&gt; And they believe the spirit of God is
[39:42] invisible like the wind.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Right? Some people believe the wind when
[39:48] it blows is the breath of God.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the beliefs come from watching
[39:55] babies being born. Why? Because a baby's
[39:58] born and he's struggling. And as soon as
[39:59] the breath comes in, they believe
[40:02] &gt;&gt; the breath of God has given him life.
[40:05] And so they literally believe it's
[40:07] breath, right? And people dying breathe
[40:11] their last breath and the and and the
[40:14] life is gone.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; And how babies suck in their first
[40:18] breath and how a dying person exhales
[40:21] the last one. Most religious people
[40:23] believe that it is the Holy Ghost in the
[40:26] person's spirit given by God entering or
[40:29] exiting the body. I think I might have
[40:32] told you before it leads to all kinds of
[40:34] things like when people sneeze and the
[40:37] old English traditions where the you
[40:39] know the spirit comes out and that's why
[40:41] you say bless you because the enemy can
[40:44] catch and then comes back in
[40:46] &gt;&gt; right you know that
[40:48] &gt;&gt; gaze
[40:50] &gt;&gt; bless you good health gaze in the German
[40:55] uh so now by uh us understanding what
[40:59] the holy spirit is we can put aside all
[41:01] the confusion about this, right? Because
[41:04] it's it's more than that.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; It signifies the entering into the
[41:08] holiest of holies.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; So all scriptures like and think of it,
[41:14] you say, "Okay, brother, th those are
[41:16] you know those are the religions of of
[41:18] other or beliefs of other religions. But
[41:21] what about us? What about Christianity?
[41:23] What about the Jews?" Yes, the Jews as
[41:24] well, right? You know from the
[41:26] scriptures, God blew into Adam's
[41:29] nostrils.
[41:30] the breath of life and man became a
[41:32] living soul or the Lord Jesus blowing on
[41:36] them and they receiving the Holy Ghost,
[41:38] right? And so I don't know if you've
[41:42] ever seen I had a cousin in South
[41:44] Africa. Uh I probably have a cousin. I
[41:47] haven't heard of her in a while.
[41:50] But they uh um they were in the they
[41:53] were denominational and in the Benihinn
[41:55] meetings that came into South Africa.
[41:57] And so Benihinn had this thing, you
[41:59] know, he would he the the choir would be
[42:01] there and people would be there and he
[42:03] would go and they'd all fall down
[42:06] &gt;&gt; or wave his coat and they all fall down
[42:08] and would tell me he's so anointed, you
[42:10] know, but of course we know what it is.
[42:12] The first person falls down and pushes
[42:14] all the others, but they feel it's
[42:16] powerful and he's he his breath he's
[42:19] blowing. And then you'd have these
[42:21] fellows like Kenneth Hagen and these men
[42:23] would would uh walk through the crowds
[42:26] and blow on people and they just fall
[42:28] down or they start laughing
[42:30] hysterically,
[42:32] right? You probably seen more of that
[42:33] than I have. Um but this is where all
[42:36] these things come from because Christ
[42:39] blew on them and they received the Holy
[42:40] Ghost. Well, then we can blow on people
[42:42] and they receive the Holy Ghost. But
[42:45] we've never seen the prophet of the hour
[42:46] do that.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; You can see how then these scriptures
[42:51] are so misinterpreted.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; And be careful people when you start
[42:56] seeing people in the message start
[42:58] taking on these dangerous things that
[43:00] have got zero to do with what the Holy
[43:02] Ghost really is.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So by that statement you can
[43:08] gather that it is important to
[43:10] understand that the understand the
[43:12] godhead to fully understand the Holy
[43:15] Ghost. We will incorporate this into
[43:16] what we're going to be touching on
[43:18] today. Blowing upon people. Nope, that's
[43:22] not it. That's not what brings the Holy
[43:24] Ghost. So, probably the most important
[43:27] answer on the Holy Ghost that people are
[43:30] looking for today is
[43:33] brother, how are we supposed to receive
[43:35] it?
[43:37] Right? And the other question um that
[43:40] people are asking and looking for an
[43:43] answer is how do I know that I have it?
[43:47] Right? So many people don't want to
[43:50] spend the time knowing what it is. They
[43:53] just want to get it and be done with it
[43:55] and receive all the benefits and proceed
[43:57] further. Right? And it doesn't work like
[44:00] that. Then many people have convinced
[44:03] themselves that they have it based that
[44:06] I have the Holy Ghost, brother. I know I
[44:08] have the Holy Ghost. And how do you
[44:09] know? Because I had an experience.
[44:12] You've heard that too.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; And uh then later things happen and then
[44:17] they doubt whether they had the
[44:18] experience.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Or what experience it was. So let's
[44:23] consider what the prophet says. And to
[44:25] me this is my favorite quote on the Holy
[44:28] Ghost on receiving the Holy Ghost. Uh I
[44:31] remember as a young minister this I I
[44:33] don't know how many colors I I uh uh
[44:37] mocked this with and memorized it and
[44:40] every time I spoke about it this is the
[44:43] most important one. It's on I think it's
[44:45] page six paragraph 22. Are you with us?
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Upon this place we wish to approach the
[44:51] subject which I think is the outstanding
[44:54] subject of today of the what is the Holy
[44:58] Spirit? What is it? And now the reason
[45:01] I've taken this subject in line like
[45:03] this, you cannot come, are you
[45:05] listening? You cannot come and receive
[45:07] the Holy Spirit unless you know what it
[45:10] is.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; First requirement.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:13] &gt;&gt; And you cannot receive it if you know
[45:16] what it is.
[45:18] Unless you believe it's given to you and
[45:21] it's for you. Amen.
[45:24] &gt;&gt; And then number three, you cannot know
[45:27] whether you've got it or not unless you
[45:30] know what results it brings.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; And this is my favorite statement. So if
[45:36] you know what it is and who it's to and
[45:39] what action it brings when it comes,
[45:42] then you know what you've got when you
[45:43] get it.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; There it is. That's just would settle
[45:48] it. And it's like, it's like the prophet
[45:50] says, it's like, "Yeah, now we can close
[45:53] up and go home."
[45:55] Right? If you know what it is, you
[45:58] believe it's given to you and it's for
[46:00] you and you know what results it brings,
[46:03] then you know what you've got when you
[46:04] get it.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need to break that downise.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; And of course, the problem is when
[46:11] people believe uh and today when it's
[46:13] taught to people that this is what the
[46:15] Holy Ghost is, they teach what it was.
[46:18] Amen.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; And then the results they want is what
[46:23] it used to bring.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; So we are going to base this entire
[46:31] study on this little bit of advice from
[46:33] the prophet. What is the Holy Ghost?
[46:35] Believe that it's given for me. Believe
[46:38] that it's for me. This is a very
[46:40] important state that it's for me. I am
[46:43] not Peter
[46:45] from 2,000 years ago.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not a fisherman.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not someone who doesn't have the
[46:52] message of the hour.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; So what is it for me?
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you want to really get a
[47:03] full understanding, you have to explore
[47:04] the scriptures and the message to
[47:06] fulfill these four things. I just want
[47:08] to highlight some important things. Do
[47:10] you love the scripture? Amen.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Do you love Bible study?
[47:12] &gt;&gt; I love it. It's like, you know, I rub my
[47:15] hands together, settle myself in my
[47:16] seat, and start enjoying it
[47:19] &gt;&gt; and gets the gastric juices flowing and
[47:22] digestion and everything happening.
[47:23] Amen. Spiritually, of course.
[47:26] So, I want to highlight some important
[47:28] things that may add more light to the
[47:30] question. What is the Holy Ghost? And
[47:32] brother Baron preached a message on it,
[47:33] which I believe many of you have read.
[47:35] And if you haven't, you must read it.
[47:38] What is the Holy Ghost? And in there he
[47:40] covers things that a well-traought
[47:41] Christian or a Pentecostal would
[47:44] understand. Someone from the Pentecostal
[47:46] age and and a Pentecostal will read that
[47:48] message. What is the Holy Ghost to say?
[47:50] Yeah, I agree with everything. It it
[47:53] sounds right round about what we
[47:55] believe. But we are not a part of the
[47:57] Pentecostal age.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; And you shouldn't take it for granted
[48:01] that everyone is well and sufficiently
[48:03] taught on it. Right? You owe it to
[48:06] yourself to take it slow and search
[48:08] through the word. Do you love him
[48:10] saints?
[48:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, coming back to religions of
[48:14] the earth, we must admit then when we
[48:17] think of the Holy Spirit, now I'm going
[48:18] to start talking about it and and then
[48:22] uh I don't want you to get confused. I
[48:23] want you to stay with me.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost,
[48:28] right? I'm speaking of it as if they are
[48:29] two different things
[48:31] &gt;&gt; for a reason. And so we have a pre
[48:34] preconceived idea of it and yet we don't
[48:36] know where it came from. We just read in
[48:39] the Bible, Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost, and
[48:42] we got so used to it because we're
[48:43] Christians and because we message
[48:44] believers, we don't take long enough to
[48:46] consider they were written that way for
[48:50] a specific reason by people over a
[48:53] thousand years ago who thought it's
[48:55] significant to write it differently.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; Right? So there are basically a few
[49:03] Abrahamic religions as the world calls
[49:05] it. The big three are Judaism,
[49:08] Christianity and Islam. Then there's
[49:10] also bahayism and to a certain extent
[49:14] babism that are offshoots of Islam and
[49:17] that are sort of draw also from Judaism.
[49:20] Right? Have you heard of those? Mostly
[49:22] uh they are mixed with pagan beliefs of
[49:25] Persia and Africa. The basis of these
[49:28] religions is this that there is one God
[49:32] who revealed his name Yahweh to Abraham.
[49:37] Amen. And uh or Abraham's people and
[49:40] they all believe in prophets and the
[49:44] constant belief is that the Holy Spirit
[49:47] is what God put on the prophets.
[49:51] They believe this long before the Holy
[49:53] Ghost came to us, right? long before
[49:56] they believed that when a prophet came,
[49:59] it was the spirit of God upon the
[50:02] prophet.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. What What am I saying to you? This
[50:05] is a belief that the Jews had. This is a
[50:08] belief that Christians had. This is a
[50:10] belief that Islam has.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Right? This is a belief that uh these
[50:15] bahayas people, Bahayism and Babism also
[50:19] have. Now looking at that alone, is it
[50:22] not similar to what we believe and why
[50:24] we can so easily accept that God spoke
[50:27] through brother Brandham because God's
[50:30] spirit was in him.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; You're basically believing the same
[50:34] thing as other people, other religions.
[50:36] He's got this. I know if you if you um
[50:39] ever meet Hindu people and if you've
[50:41] ever seen what they call the trance and
[50:44] where they stick hooks in them and pull
[50:46] carriages and when that person gets the
[50:48] trance and and they believe they will
[50:51] tell you he's got the god on him. He's
[50:54] got the spirit of the god on him. To be
[50:56] able to do that, it has to take the
[50:59] spirit of the god to be on him. All
[51:01] right. So I want to show you this
[51:02] scripture from Numbers 11 29. And Moses
[51:07] said unto him, "Enest thou for my sake?
[51:11] Would God that all the Lord's people
[51:13] were prophets and that the Lord would
[51:16] put his spirit upon them?"
[51:19] You know, it's not in my notes, but it's
[51:21] it's quite significant. He didn't say
[51:25] the Lord will put his spirit upon the
[51:27] people and make them prophets.
[51:30] He said,
[51:32] "Would to God that all the Lord's people
[51:35] were prophets and that the Lord would
[51:37] put his spirit upon them."
[51:39] &gt;&gt; You can be a prophet without the spirit
[51:40] of the Lord because a prophet is a gift,
[51:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[51:44] &gt;&gt; But it's he's pointing out for some
[51:46] reason is is an accepted thing of uh to
[51:49] earth's people from the old days that
[51:52] the spirit of God could come upon man.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; From that, I just want to take that
[51:58] point that the Lord would put his spirit
[52:02] upon them. Can you see how far back the
[52:04] book of Numbers,
[52:06] &gt;&gt; we have a scripture that that confirms
[52:08] to us that God can put his spirit upon
[52:12] man,
[52:13] &gt;&gt; right? That's our foundation. And
[52:16] brother Maram is absolutely correct in
[52:18] that it is so easy to confuse the
[52:21] actions of the Holy Spirit
[52:23] &gt;&gt; because how do you know whether it is
[52:25] the spirit of God upon them? They're
[52:27] prophets. There are prophets. There is a
[52:29] prophet like Balum who brother Bam said
[52:32] was a true prophet
[52:34] &gt;&gt; because when he prophesied what he
[52:36] prophesied came true
[52:38] &gt;&gt; was a true prophet
[52:40] &gt;&gt; but it was also a false prophet.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:45] So this is why with the with the gift of
[52:48] prophecy, you can have someone with the
[52:49] gift of prophecy and they may not have
[52:51] the spirit of God on them.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; So the only sort of proof we have of
[52:57] this is where the Bible speaks
[52:58] specifically of the Holy Spirit and the
[53:01] Holy Ghost. The the four the scriptures
[53:03] we are going to go through. Um for now
[53:05] we we we want to glance at them. We want
[53:07] to draw a few conclusions and we want to
[53:09] discuss this. So where this uh came from
[53:13] for me was um many years ago, I would
[53:16] say over 10 years ago, I had a young
[53:18] person who who asked me the question,
[53:21] "Brother Al, is the is the Holy Spirit
[53:23] and the Holy Ghost the same?" And I
[53:24] thought, "Wow, I never thought about
[53:27] that." Uh because just like any normal
[53:30] message believer, I brother Brandham
[53:32] uses it interchangeably,
[53:35] you know, and uh I just assume they
[53:37] Yeah, they are the same. But obviously
[53:39] the reason there's something in this
[53:41] person's heart that that they were
[53:42] looking for and I take questions very
[53:44] seriously. So I said you know let me go
[53:47] and studied and of course I came back
[53:48] with an answer that nobody really likes.
[53:52] The you know I said the truth is they
[53:54] are the same and yet not the same. And
[53:58] you know, message believers be like,
[53:59] "Dear Lord, can't anything in the word
[54:01] just be straightforward just for once?"
[54:04] You know, so let's just get this
[54:07] straight from the outset.
[54:09] Things are only that complicated because
[54:12] of what man does,
[54:14] &gt;&gt; right? It's complicated because the
[54:17] scriptures were written in Hebrew and
[54:18] Chaldian and Aramaic or coin Greek and
[54:22] and then it was translated into English
[54:24] and here we are and you don't even speak
[54:26] English, you speak American, you know,
[54:29] and then you're you're trying to uh
[54:32] translate it from the English, you're
[54:34] trying to translate it from you're
[54:35] trying to understand different
[54:36] interpretations, you know, and and so
[54:40] how do we know we are speaking exactly
[54:43] what was written without the Holy Holy
[54:44] Spirit, how are we ever going to get the
[54:47] correct interpretation? Amen. So things
[54:51] are only complicated because of what man
[54:53] has done. God did not complicate
[54:55] anything.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; So what we are doing is undoing what has
[55:00] been misinterpreted.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do. What has been
[55:05] misplaced and dislocated for many, many
[55:07] years. So how is the Holy Spirit and the
[55:10] Holy Ghost the same and yet not the
[55:13] same? Some of you will be saying,
[55:14] "Brother Alistister, you're just making
[55:16] things up. You're not saying what
[55:17] Brother Baron says. Stop it." Okay, let
[55:21] me give you an idea. You all ready for
[55:23] this?
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Okay. Is the father and the son the
[55:27] same?
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Now, if you There's a scripture that
[55:34] says, "He that hath the father hath the
[55:36] son also."
[55:38] &gt;&gt; He that loveth the father loveth the son
[55:40] also.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Is the father and the son the same?
[55:42] There's my answer. Yes and no.
[55:46] Right? Like a good extrinitarian, you
[55:49] will say, "But hold on, brother Al.
[55:51] Those are two different attributes." You
[55:53] know, one is an attribute of father,
[55:55] attribute of son. I can see you being
[55:57] through message university
[55:59] with the Holy Ghost. Brother Al, you're
[56:01] talking about the same thing. The Holy
[56:02] Ghost and the Holy Spirit. It's not a
[56:04] different person in the Godhead. It's
[56:05] the same thing, just different words.
[56:08] Okay. Uh same person. Okay. Uh, is the
[56:12] word and Jesus the same?
[56:16] &gt;&gt; Yes and no.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Because before he was Jesus, he was the
[56:20] word. And when he was the word, he was
[56:22] not known as Jesus. He became the word
[56:25] made flesh. And that's when the word was
[56:27] known as Jesus.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Right? And right now, we have Jesus as
[56:32] the word living within us.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; But it's not Jesus in the flesh from
[56:36] 2,000 years ago literally inhabiting my
[56:40] being.
[56:41] And then I am becoming him.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; And yet my name is Alistister.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; So am I Jesus made flesh? Yes. Am I
[56:50] Jesus? Yes and no.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; See uh you can glorify God in me but you
[56:59] can't glorify me.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; You can worship God in me but you can't
[57:03] worship me.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Right? And Jesus himself says I I come
[57:07] to do the works of my father. Do not
[57:10] judge me for anything else but for those
[57:11] works sake. If you seen me, you seen the
[57:14] father. And then he says, "Glorify God."
[57:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; So how how about that? Jesus came and he
[57:26] was the word. But before Jesus came, the
[57:28] word was not known as Jesus. In the same
[57:31] way, before it was called the Holy
[57:34] Ghost, it was called the Holy Spirit.
[57:38] That's right.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; All we need to do is understand what the
[57:41] difference is.
[57:42] &gt;&gt; It is the same and it is not the same.
[57:45] Why did the writers write it
[57:47] differently? So what makes it the same
[57:49] and not the same?
[57:50] &gt;&gt; The manifestation.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; That's all the manifestation of the word
[57:56] in Abraham's day. The manifestation of
[57:58] the word in Jesus Christ. Different
[58:01] manifestation.
[58:02] Amen. That's all that happened. So let's
[58:05] let's understand. Let's look at the
[58:06] manifestations. If you really want to
[58:08] know what it is, you have to study the
[58:10] manifestations from the beginning all
[58:12] the way through to the end to understand
[58:15] what this really is. So, let's make a
[58:17] few important observations. Are you
[58:18] still with me?
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; The phrase Holy Spirit only occurs in
[58:24] the Bible seven times. Three times in
[58:27] the Old Testament, four times in the New
[58:29] Testament. The the phrase Holy Ghost
[58:32] appears 89 times in the Bible and never
[58:36] in the Old Testament.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Spirit of God appears 26 times in the
[58:43] Bible, 14 times in the Old Testament,
[58:46] and 12 times in the New Testament. So
[58:49] these men who were inspired by the same
[58:53] Holy Ghost
[58:55] wrote it differently. If it was all the
[58:58] same, why not just use Holy Ghost from
[59:00] the beginning? Why not just use Holy
[59:03] Spirit throughout? Why make a
[59:05] differentiation?
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Right? What is the point of these
[59:10] observations? Maybe it's just the way
[59:11] the interpreters of the original script
[59:14] chose to print it. That would be true,
[59:16] but for a few exceptions. So, I want to
[59:18] show you this. John 7 and verse 39 says,
[59:21] "But this spake he of the spirit which
[59:24] they believe on him should receive. They
[59:26] that believe in him should receive for
[59:28] the Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[59:31] that Jesus was not yet glorified.
[59:34] Right? Now you know the religious
[59:36] message people would say just say what
[59:38] it says.
[59:40] But what does it mean right? Anyone with
[59:43] a brain will tell you it's basically
[59:45] saying the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[59:47] until Jesus was glorified.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; So it's telling you the Holy Ghost came
[59:51] after Jesus.
[59:55] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:56] At first, this lets us know the Holy
[59:58] Ghost only came after Jesus. And the the
[1:00:02] people who are interpreting it into
[1:00:04] English, this the reason they chose to
[1:00:07] write Holy Ghost after Jesus.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; There's a scripture telling us that
[1:00:12] because that Jesus was not yet
[1:00:13] glorified. The Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:00:16] given. So what did David have?
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; What did Moses have? What did Jonah
[1:00:23] have? What did all those men of the Old
[1:00:25] Testament? Did they not have the Holy
[1:00:27] Ghost?
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Right? Let's go to Psalm 51:1.
[1:00:34] This is David, the one we were just
[1:00:35] talking about. He says, "Cast me not
[1:00:36] away from thy presence and take not thy
[1:00:39] Holy Spirit from me." So for those
[1:00:42] people who said, "Well, the Holy Ghost
[1:00:43] was not yet given." So that's why David
[1:00:46] and all of them did not have the Holy
[1:00:48] Ghost, right? So what did they have? And
[1:00:51] here we have a scripture telling us that
[1:00:52] David had something
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; because he's saying don't take it from
[1:00:57] me.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Meaning he had it
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; and listen this is happening after he
[1:01:02] committed adultery.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; The reason I'm saying this is because we
[1:01:08] have other interpretations of the Holy
[1:01:11] Spirit like saying if you have mistakes
[1:01:13] you don't have the Holy Spirit.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; The man had he committed adultery and
[1:01:18] he's saying don't take the Holy Spirit
[1:01:19] from me. Yeah,
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; he committed adultery. He was made he
[1:01:24] the the prophet made him know he was a
[1:01:27] sinner. He was a murderer and he was an
[1:01:28] adulterer. And he's not saying I've lost
[1:01:31] the Holy Ghost. I've lost the Holy
[1:01:32] Spirit. He said don't take it from me.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; So we judge one another by the mistakes
[1:01:40] we make and we say, "Well, if you had
[1:01:42] the Holy Spirit, you won't do that. If
[1:01:44] you have the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't
[1:01:46] have done that. You The Holy Spirit has
[1:01:48] got nothing to do with that. All right.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to understand.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here David speaks as if the
[1:01:58] Holy Spirit was with him. If you're
[1:02:00] confused a little bit or you pushing
[1:02:02] back a little bit, just wait on. We're
[1:02:04] going to enjoy this journey together.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Believe me.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; So what did David have if the Holy Ghost
[1:02:10] was not yet given? Right. Mark 12. For
[1:02:14] David himself, now we've got in Mark,
[1:02:17] it's translated into English and it's
[1:02:19] speaking about David. For for David
[1:02:21] himself said by the Holy Ghost,
[1:02:26] the Lord said to my Lord, "Sit thou on
[1:02:27] my right hand till I make thine enemies
[1:02:29] thy foottool."
[1:02:31] Oh,
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; right. First, the Holy Ghost was not yet
[1:02:36] given until Jesus was glorified. Now,
[1:02:38] we're saying David was speaking by the
[1:02:41] Holy Ghost.
[1:02:44] Amen. I love it when it gets more
[1:02:46] confusing
[1:02:48] because then we know it's a real
[1:02:50] revelation to us. Amen.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; So, David says this by the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:54] How could how could it not have been
[1:02:56] given them? Isaiah 63:10
[1:02:59] um and 11, but they rebelled and vexed
[1:03:02] his holy spirit. Therefore, he was
[1:03:04] turned to be their enemy. He fought
[1:03:07] against them. This is speaking of the
[1:03:08] Holy Spirit with the nation of Israel.
[1:03:11] And verse 11 says, "Then he remembered
[1:03:13] the days of Moses of old Moses and his
[1:03:16] people, saying, "Where is he that bought
[1:03:19] uh brought them out of the sea uh with
[1:03:23] the shepherd of his flock? Where is he
[1:03:25] that put his holy spirit within him?"
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; So what we have is it looks like the
[1:03:31] Holy Spirit was within Moses
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; as the Holy Spirit was within David,
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; right? So did the Old Testament saints
[1:03:40] have the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost?
[1:03:43] Because we see that we see the words
[1:03:45] Holy Spirit in the Old Testament, but we
[1:03:47] see the Holy Ghost only in the New
[1:03:49] Testament. Right? If it was the same,
[1:03:52] you say, "No, brother, it's the same."
[1:03:54] And you have all the, you know, the
[1:03:56] people uh who are who get zealous about
[1:03:58] it and who believe that if they shout
[1:04:00] louder and scream louder and faint
[1:04:02] harder, then they have it,
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; you know. No, it's the same. It's the
[1:04:06] same. Okay. So why did the Old Testament
[1:04:09] saints not speak with tongues
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; and get slain in the spirit
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; or have healing campaigns and jump
[1:04:17] around and scream and shout and have
[1:04:18] church?
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; Why do they act so different? Why were
[1:04:23] there no altar calls in Moses day? Why
[1:04:26] do they not go out and same Holy Spirit
[1:04:29] you say? Why do they not act the same?
[1:04:32] Why do we want to make or define the
[1:04:34] Holy Ghost of this day only as this?
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Right? Why do they have to be the same
[1:04:42] Holy Spirit inspire them to be deathly
[1:04:44] silent in the tabernacle? Speak one word
[1:04:46] and you die.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Now you can shout, scream, and hip hip
[1:04:51] hooray and run around screaming and act
[1:04:53] all disorderly and claim to have the
[1:04:55] Holy Spirit. But in the Old Testament,
[1:04:58] you try that. You wouldn't even make it
[1:05:01] one foot forward. You'd be dead.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Same Holy Spirit.
[1:05:06] &gt;&gt; So, was it the Holy Spirit in the saints
[1:05:10] on the saints or not? What is the
[1:05:12] difference? Amen. You see, when you look
[1:05:15] at it and you ask questions, you start
[1:05:17] to see it. Why? Because the answers are
[1:05:19] in your heart. Amen. So even in the New
[1:05:23] Testament, it speaks as if God was still
[1:05:26] going to give the Holy Spirit to the New
[1:05:28] Testament people, right? Let's go to
[1:05:30] Luke 11:13.
[1:05:34] If you then being evil know how to give
[1:05:37] good gifts unto your children, how much
[1:05:40] more shall your heavenly father give the
[1:05:42] Holy Spirit to them that ask him? So it
[1:05:46] looks like God is willing to give the
[1:05:48] Holy Spirit to the New Testament saints.
[1:05:51] Right? Ephesians 1:13 says, "In whom you
[1:05:54] also trusted, after that you heard the
[1:05:56] word of truth, the gospel of your
[1:05:57] salvation, in whom also after that you
[1:06:00] believed, you were sealed with that Holy
[1:06:02] Spirit of promise."
[1:06:05] Now, we're seeing it in the New
[1:06:07] Testament. It's not just um we see this
[1:06:10] in Luke 11 and also in Ephesians which
[1:06:13] is after Christ is glorified. We see the
[1:06:16] promise that he wants to give his holy
[1:06:19] spirit to the Gentiles.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Clearly the Gentiles did not have the
[1:06:25] Holy Spirit. Now we thought that a lot
[1:06:29] of people say the Holy Ghost sealed us,
[1:06:32] right? And here the scriptures say you
[1:06:34] are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God
[1:06:36] till the day of your redemption. There's
[1:06:38] a significant difference there and we're
[1:06:39] going to talk about that too, right? 1
[1:06:42] Thessalonians 4:8. He therefore that
[1:06:45] despiseth despiseth not man, but God who
[1:06:49] hath also given unto us his holy spirit.
[1:06:53] Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Do you have the Holy Spirit or not? How
[1:06:58] do you know?
[1:06:59] So yet again it seems like the two are
[1:07:02] the same. Yet there are scriptures that
[1:07:04] said the Holy Ghost is not given before
[1:07:06] Christ. How can that be if some whole
[1:07:09] Old Testament saints also had the Holy
[1:07:11] Ghost? Right? Look at this one also
[1:07:15] another scripture that speaks about uh
[1:07:17] something that happened before Christ
[1:07:20] was glorified. Are you still with me?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Matthew 1:18. Now the birth of Jesus
[1:07:25] Christ was on this wise when as his
[1:07:27] mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[1:07:29] before they came together she was found
[1:07:31] with child of the Holy Ghost.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; This is before Acts chapter 2. You can
[1:07:39] so easily say well look Mary had the
[1:07:41] Holy Ghost. It doesn't say that. It says
[1:07:43] she was found with child of the Holy
[1:07:45] Ghost.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Right? So you agree there's a lot we
[1:07:49] need to understand. Let's not take it
[1:07:51] for granted. If you know what it is, if
[1:07:53] you believe what it or that it's given
[1:07:55] for you and it is for you and you know
[1:07:57] what results it brings, then you know
[1:07:59] what you got when you get it.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; So Mary was obviously before Christ came
[1:08:06] uh and she received the Holy Ghost to
[1:08:08] conceive Christ.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, she could not
[1:08:14] conceive Christ.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was necessary for her to
[1:08:17] conceive.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; These are all these little beautiful
[1:08:20] clues. So we could debate many uh about
[1:08:23] many things uh but the simplicity of it
[1:08:26] is the father is a spirit.
[1:08:30] What does it even mean? The father is
[1:08:32] not a separate person. The father is a
[1:08:34] word that describes a relationship of
[1:08:36] God to man before Christ came.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Right? So is the father not a holy
[1:08:43] spirit?
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Look at our understanding. We're saying
[1:08:46] what is a holy spirit to you and I? Holy
[1:08:49] means he's got no sin. There's no dirt.
[1:08:53] There's no filth. There's no uh shame.
[1:08:56] There's no guilt. He's holy. He's pious.
[1:08:59] He's uh No, that's not what it is,
[1:09:03] right? Holy Spirit. So, the Holy Spirit
[1:09:07] or Holy Ghost is always about God's
[1:09:11] spirit upon or in man.
[1:09:17] The Holy Spirit has got to do with man.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; The father is spirit. Yes. What's the
[1:09:24] difference between father and holy
[1:09:25] spirit? The holy spirit has got to do
[1:09:28] with man.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; The Jewish Bible uses the word spirit.
[1:09:33] And you you may have heard this. The
[1:09:35] word ru. Have you heard that? Which
[1:09:38] means breath or wind. Do you know the
[1:09:42] word ghost is in the old testament?
[1:09:45] And Abraham gave up the ghost
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; and that's in the in the Hebrew. It's a
[1:09:50] completely different to which is spirit.
[1:09:53] Two separate words. One is ghost, one is
[1:09:56] spirit. Starts giving us more clues,
[1:09:58] right? So in the Greek, which is now the
[1:10:01] New Testament, they didn't have this
[1:10:04] word ghost, which is English. It comes
[1:10:06] from the German word ghast. G A S T,
[1:10:10] which eventually came to be ghost. But
[1:10:13] then what is a ghost,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; right? Why would they use the word
[1:10:21] ghost?
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Apparently ghost is the spirit of
[1:10:26] someone who has died
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; which is made visible.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; I saw the spirit. It was a ghost.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; So the spirit is invisible. But when
[1:10:40] it's visible, it's ghost. That's right.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; They had some reasoning behind what they
[1:10:47] were writing.
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; They were not silly men. I tell you
[1:10:50] that.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Right. So, it's the same thing, but not
[1:10:54] the same. There it is. We just have to
[1:10:57] understand what the meaning was. Right?
[1:10:59] So, uh ghast in the old English means a
[1:11:02] spirit that can physically be seen.
[1:11:05] Like, well, you know, people will say,
[1:11:06] "What's the matter with you? You look
[1:11:08] like you saw a ghost."
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; You've heard that. You look like you've
[1:11:11] seen a ghost. Uh, and in the old English
[1:11:14] there would be the word apparition.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; You saw something. Something that should
[1:11:18] have been invisible became visible to
[1:11:20] you.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; So basically, it's so simple. It has
[1:11:26] much more to do with the change in
[1:11:28] dispensation because what it was showing
[1:11:30] was that the spirit of God, the spirit
[1:11:33] of Christ was becoming visible upon the
[1:11:36] people
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; and they called that the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. because they began to see his
[1:11:41] spirit becoming visible. How? Because
[1:11:43] they know what these men were doing was
[1:11:46] not their own spirit.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Christ coming upon
[1:11:51] them and they called it the ghost.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the change in dispensation
[1:11:57] brought forth change in manifestations
[1:12:00] of the same spirit.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So under the ages of the
[1:12:05] father from Adam right up to the
[1:12:08] conception of Christ for 4,000 years
[1:12:11] God's spirit upon men upon men anointing
[1:12:16] them being in them were only for
[1:12:19] prophets priests kings and judges
[1:12:23] not for all the public
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; like you could see when Hannah was
[1:12:26] standing in the temple and she was she
[1:12:28] was whispering and and praying and Eli
[1:12:30] comes up to her and says what are you
[1:12:31] mad What are you doing? You know this is
[1:12:34] not allowed. Only we are supposed to
[1:12:37] speak to God, not you. You have no
[1:12:39] authority. And then she had to explain
[1:12:41] herself and he understood. And and you
[1:12:44] can't be here in the temple doing this.
[1:12:45] You literally asked her, "Are you
[1:12:47] drunk?"
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Because only a drunk person would have
[1:12:50] the guts to do something like what
[1:12:52] you're doing right now. You must be out
[1:12:54] of your mind. Can you imagine that? You
[1:12:56] and I stand here and whisper and pray
[1:12:58] and there's no problem with that. At
[1:13:00] that time, the Holy Spirit was seen as
[1:13:03] something specifically for prophets,
[1:13:05] priests, judges, and kings, men chosen
[1:13:08] by God.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Not for the public.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; And what happened with the Holy Spirit?
[1:13:14] Now, think of the same Holy Spirit
[1:13:16] that's on you. On the Holy Spirit on
[1:13:20] those Old Testament saints, you know
[1:13:22] what they did with that spirit?
[1:13:24] It anointed them to do miraculous work.
[1:13:27] And they identified a fearsome God,
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; right? For example, Moses brings 10
[1:13:36] plagues that decimates an entire nation
[1:13:38] of of Egypt,
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; kills the firstborn by the Holy Spirit.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Pillars of fire, Jericho's walls
[1:13:46] falling, son standing still, Mary's body
[1:13:50] receiving the blood cell. All those
[1:13:52] things leading up to that time, they
[1:13:54] were given abilities to kill their
[1:13:56] enemies. And even their brothers who
[1:14:00] went into era, same Holy Spirit.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Remember Finance when one of the his
[1:14:07] brothers took uh a Med Midionite woman,
[1:14:09] he took a javelin and ran him through.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; How many of you feel like running a
[1:14:13] javelin through your brother who makes a
[1:14:15] mistake?
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; You have the same Holy Spirit or not?
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; What? What is the difference?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Something has changed in the
[1:14:24] dispensation. In the Old Testament, the
[1:14:27] greatness of the manifestations was seen
[1:14:29] in ways that is unmistakably not man's
[1:14:33] works. It was the Holy Spirit because we
[1:14:36] can identify that it was God's works.
[1:14:39] Only God could have done that.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Inspire them to do that. Right? Great
[1:14:44] manifestations. They knew that man was
[1:14:46] not bringing the plagues. Yeah,
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; God was the one speaking through Moses.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; It was God's spirit in Moses. They knew
[1:14:54] that. And and so um they had abilities
[1:14:57] that today we just don't do. I mean, my
[1:15:01] my little boy asked me a month ago or
[1:15:04] something. He says, "So why don't
[1:15:08] why don't you do things why don't those
[1:15:10] great things happen today like opening
[1:15:12] the Red Sea and you know, why don't you
[1:15:16] have all these great things? you I mean
[1:15:17] it's like you could open the sea and
[1:15:18] walk all the way to brother Chad's
[1:15:20] church you know why don't you do that
[1:15:23] why do you have to uh fly why why why do
[1:15:27] you not do things like they did in those
[1:15:29] days
[1:15:31] can make a father feel really
[1:15:32] insignificant
[1:15:34] and be a preacher of God right in the
[1:15:38] New Testament then Jesus comes and says
[1:15:41] I forgive you they're beating him
[1:15:44] they're cursing at him they're spitting
[1:15:45] on him and it says Father, forgive them.
[1:15:47] They know not what they do. Same Holy
[1:15:49] Spirit.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; That would drive a javelin through a
[1:15:52] man, kill, decimate a nation, uh bring
[1:15:57] plagues upon people, bring suffering,
[1:15:59] suddenly it flips. Same Holy Spirit and
[1:16:02] it's just forgiveness and grace.
[1:16:08] What changed? Okay, this showing that it
[1:16:11] was not just an invisible spirit.
[1:16:14] Peter's shadow healed people.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Laying on hands uh laying on of hands
[1:16:21] healed people. Men's voices seemed to
[1:16:24] raise the dead.
[1:16:27] To the people, this was a ghost. An
[1:16:30] invisible spirit made visible in normal
[1:16:34] men of even low degree or even
[1:16:37] insignificant status of life. Because
[1:16:39] after Jesus, the Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:16:42] all
[1:16:43] Amen.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Not just prophets, priests, judges, and
[1:16:46] kings.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Now it fell upon all flesh. Significant
[1:16:50] difference.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; The writers were saying this is the Holy
[1:16:53] Ghost.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between this one
[1:16:56] and the manifestation of the Old
[1:16:58] Testament.
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Old Testament writers
[1:17:02] believe this anointing on men uh to be
[1:17:05] the actual breath of God or an invisible
[1:17:09] moving force. They call it the ru
[1:17:11] hakodesh in the Hebrew. And this is why
[1:17:14] the English translators chose to
[1:17:16] identify it as the holy spirit because
[1:17:19] the English translators interpreted
[1:17:21] spirit as breath. Right? For example, a
[1:17:25] dying person's breath leaving him was
[1:17:27] his spirit leaving him. And the other
[1:17:30] word used in the Hebrew uh in the same
[1:17:32] context is shakina.
[1:17:35] But in some places, the translators
[1:17:37] still use Holy Spirit.
[1:17:42] I don't know about you, but I love to
[1:17:45] know everything about it.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave a little piece
[1:17:48] out. I want to know everything about it
[1:17:50] so that I know what I've got when I get
[1:17:52] it.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it was the same Holy Spirit of
[1:17:57] God anointing man differently for
[1:18:00] different dispensations. Do we all get
[1:18:02] that? The writers of this New Testament
[1:18:04] wrote in Aramaic. They wrote in Greek
[1:18:07] and they use words described as air or
[1:18:10] breath. In the in the Greek it's numa if
[1:18:13] those of you searching it up. So again
[1:18:15] this is where the translators use the
[1:18:17] word holy spirit. But when they use the
[1:18:19] words anointing power etc they were
[1:18:24] referring to the holy ghost. Amen. So
[1:18:27] spirit
[1:18:29] power and anointing ghost spirit holy
[1:18:33] spirit that which is within you doing
[1:18:35] something but holy ghost power and
[1:18:38] anointing are we together right so the
[1:18:41] writers and translators knew the
[1:18:42] difference and they tried to express it
[1:18:44] differently giving it a name that would
[1:18:47] show the difference and the definition
[1:18:49] then the holy ghost or the holy spirit
[1:18:51] basically saints is the anointing of god
[1:18:54] for mankind now we got understand why
[1:18:57] it's necessary.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; So, you still with me?
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; In every dispensation, it changes.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Every dispensation.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; We got to understand why it changes
[1:19:12] because the Holy Spirit is obedient to
[1:19:14] something.
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason it changes.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; Okay? Same Holy Spirit, but it's
[1:19:22] changing because it's obedient to
[1:19:24] something. What is it? obedient to the
[1:19:27] revelation of the word for that day.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; It's going to anoint you. You know, like
[1:19:34] how the prophet says Moses couldn't take
[1:19:36] Noah's revelation and build an ark and
[1:19:39] sail out of Egypt.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Because that wasn't the word for that
[1:19:44] day.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Moses would not have received the Holy
[1:19:47] Spirit ability to build an ark.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. And even though it would
[1:19:52] have been the word for a previous day
[1:19:55] and a great anointing and great ability
[1:19:57] would have been fantastic to see Moses
[1:20:00] and the people in Goan building an ark,
[1:20:02] it wasn't going to work. It was going to
[1:20:04] be an interpretation that was not going
[1:20:07] to work for their day because the Holy
[1:20:09] Spirit was not going to anoint them on
[1:20:10] the word of Noah's day.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost is
[1:20:16] influence or rather follows the word for
[1:20:19] the day. That's why the manifestation is
[1:20:22] different.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; So when the full revelation of the word
[1:20:27] is come, the manifestations of the
[1:20:29] spirit need no longer be seen because
[1:20:33] the people would manifest the works by
[1:20:35] faith, not needing gifts or sensations
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit is bringing you
[1:20:42] up to receive the full word. And when
[1:20:46] you have the full word, you are going to
[1:20:48] have the full manifestation of Christ
[1:20:50] made flesh. And you don't need help.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Which is what that Holy Spirit is. It's
[1:20:59] help. It's a guide. Amen. Now everything
[1:21:03] becomes one. It's the fullness of the
[1:21:05] Godhead bodily when it brings you up to
[1:21:07] that time when you become the word made
[1:21:09] flesh. Listen, I'm not saying you don't
[1:21:12] need the Holy Ghost anymore. Don't make
[1:21:14] that mistake.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Let's understand. So therefore, today
[1:21:18] people are expecting. This is the reason
[1:21:21] it's confusing because people are
[1:21:23] expecting to have the Holy Ghost like
[1:21:26] Acts chapter 2.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; And listen people, you know what a
[1:21:30] mockery it's been, right? From Pentecost
[1:21:33] all the way up to now. And it's what
[1:21:37] they call speaking in tongues was just
[1:21:40] glosselia.
[1:21:41] That's not what happened in Acts chapter
[1:21:43] 2. You know that they spoke different
[1:21:46] languages of other men
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; and and I don't know how the churches
[1:21:50] just let it slip and all you get is
[1:21:53] glosselia which is just like gibberish
[1:21:56] being spoken
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; and they just claim by by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:00] you know this is another language where
[1:22:03] there's actually supposed to be a person
[1:22:05] who speaks that language that interprets
[1:22:08] that. And then what we had is churches
[1:22:11] having someone speaking in in a tongue
[1:22:13] and then interpreting that
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; themselves and then it's not even
[1:22:18] interpreted by two or three witnesses to
[1:22:20] establish it. It's just accepted as a
[1:22:22] gift. And why? Because people are
[1:22:24] afraid.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; I was just telling brother Chad this and
[1:22:29] just just
[1:22:31] um a little bit off topic. when you take
[1:22:33] a gift of the Holy Ghost and and this is
[1:22:36] something serious that we did with
[1:22:38] people is um the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:42] have to be under subjection of humility
[1:22:45] because it's so easy to go to pride
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; right now. And I asked my church this
[1:22:52] just last week. I said to them, uh how
[1:22:56] many of you here been in the message for
[1:22:58] like 30, 40 years? Let's see your hands.
[1:23:00] How many of you been 30, 40 years in the
[1:23:02] message? Yes.
[1:23:04] So, how many of you you remember the uh
[1:23:07] people who spoke with tongues and
[1:23:09] prophesied? How many of you can remember
[1:23:11] yourself being comfortable with them?
[1:23:17] You were more terrified that they were
[1:23:19] going to expose you.
[1:23:23] That that's what I hope he doesn't
[1:23:24] prophesy about me. I hope he doesn't say
[1:23:26] something bad about me. Not that you
[1:23:28] have something bad, but you just w with
[1:23:30] these gifts somehow these gifts always
[1:23:33] speak bad things.
[1:23:35] There's just never any good things that
[1:23:37] they prophesy about. Just always
[1:23:39] something bad, you know. And so what
[1:23:41] happens is this fear sort of builds up
[1:23:44] in the people about this person with the
[1:23:46] gift. Now what happens when you do that?
[1:23:49] When you make yourself fearful of
[1:23:51] someone, you are giving that person
[1:23:53] power.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Power that corrupts him. Yes.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; See, and it shouldn't be that way
[1:24:00] because this man should be under
[1:24:03] humility.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; He should know he should he should know
[1:24:06] that this people should not fear him.
[1:24:09] And when you fear a man, you start to
[1:24:12] give him power that corrupts him. We
[1:24:14] corrupt them. That's
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; And that's what's happened in the
[1:24:19] churches. Right. So saints, when the
[1:24:22] full revelation of the word has come and
[1:24:25] we have the manifestation of the spirit,
[1:24:26] we need to see the proper manifestation
[1:24:29] of the spirit. That's for this day. Do
[1:24:31] you believe that?
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's get to it.
[1:24:35] Today people are expecting to have the
[1:24:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost like Acts
[1:24:39] chapter 2, but it's a different
[1:24:41] dispensation. How do we know? Because
[1:24:43] the word is different.
[1:24:46] And the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost must
[1:24:48] anoint people according to the word
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; for the day.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Agreed? All right. So, this is where we
[1:24:57] must find the middle of the road. Let's
[1:24:58] go to a quote here. I promise you, we're
[1:25:02] halfway.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Now, here the life that was in the husk,
[1:25:07] this is the message masterpiece. in the
[1:25:09] stalk and the tassel and the husk all
[1:25:11] gathers in the seed. And the life that
[1:25:12] was in the stalk went uh one went to
[1:25:16] make the other. Justification made a way
[1:25:18] for sanctification. Sanctification made
[1:25:20] a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:22] And here it is. The baptism of the Holy
[1:25:24] Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:25:27] itself
[1:25:29] to come right down in perfection back to
[1:25:32] the word again to manifest itself. So
[1:25:36] see, I wasn't saying that when you have
[1:25:38] the fullness of the word, there's no
[1:25:40] need for the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; What what we are saying is there's no
[1:25:45] need for manifestations that were
[1:25:47] necessary when you didn't have the
[1:25:48] fullness of the word.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Let me give you the
[1:25:55] picture. Right? So when they came out of
[1:25:57] the upper room and they've got no tapes,
[1:26:01] no CDs, no message, no Bibles,
[1:26:05] They've got no written word to back up
[1:26:07] what they're saying.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; They're coming out to say Jesus Christ
[1:26:11] is God made flesh. He was crucified. He
[1:26:15] died and rose again. And we are
[1:26:16] witnesses of that. And what are the
[1:26:18] people going to say? Oh yeah.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Prove it. Yes.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; So with what little word they had, they
[1:26:27] required gifts of the Holy Ghost to
[1:26:30] vindicate what they were saying,
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; to vindicate their message. So the gifts
[1:26:36] of the Holy Ghost at that time and the
[1:26:38] the less word you have, the greater the
[1:26:40] manifestations need to be.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:43] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? And this is why as it
[1:26:46] progressed and the more the word came
[1:26:48] in, the less they needed help from the
[1:26:50] Holy Ghost to vindicate their word.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; And then we reached the end of the ages
[1:26:55] where you got this prophet
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; who's coming with the message to saying
[1:27:00] to say, I am the forerunner of the
[1:27:02] second coming of the Lord.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; And what are the people going to say? Oh
[1:27:05] yeah.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Prove it.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So there needs to be
[1:27:11] a manifestation to vindicate the word
[1:27:13] that he's bringing.
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; And that's why in the last day there
[1:27:16] needed to be an outpouring of the Holy
[1:27:18] Ghost again to vindicate something that
[1:27:21] was coming in.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; That's how it works.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when people are saying we need
[1:27:28] to see this, I know there's some some
[1:27:30] places in Africa where they're insisting
[1:27:32] like today uh when I mean now in 2025,
[1:27:36] you'll have ministers saying every
[1:27:39] single pastor must have the supernatural
[1:27:41] following him. He must have some kind of
[1:27:44] uh supernatural manifestation or else
[1:27:46] he's not a true minister.
[1:27:49] like he he must either prophesy or speak
[1:27:52] with tongues and then it puts pressure
[1:27:54] on the men and then the men start faking
[1:27:56] things
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; and and to what to what end?
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; you have the fullness of the word. The
[1:28:02] fullness of the word is come. So So then
[1:28:04] if you are still depending on the
[1:28:06] ability to vindicate you, why do we need
[1:28:08] to vindicate a word that has already
[1:28:10] been vindicated?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; It has been fully vindicated. We are
[1:28:15] preaching word that has already been
[1:28:18] fully vindicated.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; So then what do I need to vindicate
[1:28:23] myself? If I want to vindicate myself,
[1:28:25] then I have serious inferiority complex.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Then I need to prove myself to the
[1:28:31] people to elevate myself.
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; That's not what the holy the Holy Ghost
[1:28:35] is not going to clown for anyone.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Back to the word again to manifest
[1:28:42] itself. But when denominated well what
[1:28:45] denominated dies like life in Luther
[1:28:49] we're reading again went to make Wesley
[1:28:50] and from Wesley went to Pentecost and
[1:28:52] from Pentecost to make the original seed
[1:28:54] onto Pentecost comes out of the Wesley
[1:28:56] until that time. The reason that
[1:28:58] Pentecost come out of Wesley because it
[1:29:01] was no denomination. Uh Pentecost was
[1:29:04] the this is what I want to get to. Then
[1:29:06] Pentecost went to denominate and what
[1:29:10] did it do? It turned to the husk. It
[1:29:13] looked like the real thing.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Pentecost looked like the real thing.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; You know I I keep telling um message
[1:29:24] people
[1:29:25] please when you are reading things like
[1:29:28] this understand that the prophet is
[1:29:31] talking about himself.
[1:29:37] What's he telling you? He's the real
[1:29:39] thing.
[1:29:44] Go read the message. He'll tell you.
[1:29:45] We've had all the Elijah's mantels and
[1:29:48] the rushing winds and we've had the
[1:29:49] blood in the hands and we've had all of
[1:29:51] this. We've had impersonations.
[1:29:53] Impersonations of what?
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; He's being humble.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; He's telling you they are impersonations
[1:30:00] of his gift,
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; of his ministry. The more he came out
[1:30:03] and he came out with the first pull,
[1:30:05] everybody wanted the same or even
[1:30:07] better. And then they all had to come
[1:30:08] out with something extra special to to
[1:30:11] overdo what or rather to to to um uh
[1:30:15] have preeminence over what he had. And
[1:30:17] then when he when he was in his second
[1:30:19] pool, then they all wanted to have
[1:30:21] something else.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; And then he would start concocting
[1:30:24] things and having interviews with people
[1:30:27] and getting to know the secret lives.
[1:30:28] And be careful of today. There are
[1:30:30] people doing that.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Do you know how easy it is in
[1:30:34] Pentecostal churches? It's so sorrowful,
[1:30:38] pitiful that these people are so duped
[1:30:40] by all these men with gifts.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to have your secret fell
[1:30:45] there in the back going on Facebook and
[1:30:47] looking at somebody's profile and he's
[1:30:49] got a mic in he's got a thing in here
[1:30:51] saying this person was uh you know uh in
[1:30:55] Africa last week and they were wearing
[1:30:56] this color clothes. The man stands, I
[1:30:59] see you in Africa
[1:31:02] and you were wearing these clothes and
[1:31:04] you had a pearl necklace on.
[1:31:07] But his inspiration is coming from
[1:31:08] Facebook and the guy in his ear.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; I'm from Africa. I've seen these people
[1:31:14] do this,
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; do tricks with the iPads and whatever.
[1:31:19] And and they're claiming this to be
[1:31:21] gifts of the Holy Ghost. It's so easy to
[1:31:23] act like you have discernment to try and
[1:31:25] be like the prophet. In the meantime,
[1:31:27] you're using social media
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; and the people just don't even know
[1:31:31] that. I I don't understand.
[1:31:35] Then he shows how that Pentecost or
[1:31:37] brother Barham's day, his day, had the
[1:31:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost, but yet there
[1:31:42] was still the Holy Ghost person
[1:31:46] still to come, which is our day.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Did you see that in the quote?
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; Right. Justification made way for
[1:31:54] sanctification. sanctification made way
[1:31:55] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:31:57] here it is. The baptism of the Holy
[1:31:59] Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:32:02] itself to come right down in perfection.
[1:32:05] He's literally giving us the process.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; And now in a day where you and I are to
[1:32:11] be receiving the person,
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; the the people, the ministers want you
[1:32:16] to go back and get the baptism
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; of the previous day.
[1:32:23] That's right.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the baptism.
[1:32:26] You and I individually still have to go.
[1:32:28] We have to go through our own process of
[1:32:30] justification, sanctification. He was
[1:32:32] talking about similar to the seed,
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; right? What was the seed goes from the
[1:32:36] seed goes to the stalk, the leaves, the
[1:32:38] tassel, the husk. He said the husk looks
[1:32:41] like the real thing.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; People will take the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:45] Ghost, excuse me, and it looks like the
[1:32:48] real thing,
[1:32:50] but the real thing is something else.
[1:32:52] Amen.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's go through a
[1:32:55] summary. Let's go to E um Ezekiel. Oh, I
[1:32:59] didn't read that second half for you.
[1:33:02] I'll put on the screen. Ezekiel 36:26
[1:33:04] 27. You love him, saints.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; You know this very very well. A new
[1:33:08] heart also will I give you. A new spirit
[1:33:11] will I put within you, and I will take
[1:33:13] away the stony heart out of your flesh,
[1:33:15] and I will give you an heart of flesh,
[1:33:17] and I will put my spirit within you.
[1:33:21] Amen.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; So up to that point, I mean, you have a
[1:33:24] new heart, you get a new spirit, you get
[1:33:26] a new nature. Basically, I will take
[1:33:28] away your stony heart and all of that.
[1:33:30] But we know the final desire of God is
[1:33:33] that his spirit
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; dwells in you.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; Not gifts, not anointings.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; I will put my spirit within you. Amen.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Now people look at that today and say
[1:33:48] his spirit within me must produce all
[1:33:51] the the the signs and wonders and
[1:33:54] miracles and so on. His spirit is not
[1:33:57] going to do what you wanted to do.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; It's going to follow the word for the
[1:34:03] day.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; That's what's important,
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; right? Look at Joel chapter 2.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Okay. And it shall come to pass
[1:34:11] afterward with that I will pour out my
[1:34:13] spirit upon all flesh and your sons and
[1:34:15] daughters. Now this is listen what he
[1:34:17] wanted to do was put his spirit within
[1:34:19] you. But Joel prophesied of the spirit
[1:34:21] upon you
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; upon all flesh and your sons and
[1:34:25] daughters. And he's identifying you're
[1:34:26] going to prophesy. You're going to dream
[1:34:28] dreams. Your young men shall see visions
[1:34:30] and also upon the servants and upon the
[1:34:32] handmmaids. So when it came in Acts
[1:34:33] chapter 2, Peter says this is that which
[1:34:36] was spoken by the prophet Joel. So he is
[1:34:39] identifying that what came in Acts
[1:34:41] chapter 2 was what Joel prophesied of
[1:34:43] the spirit upon all flesh. The anointing
[1:34:47] on the flesh, not the spirit of God
[1:34:49] within you.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Hold that thought. Notice the
[1:34:56] difference.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Acts 2 was the fulfillment of Joel, not
[1:35:00] Ezekiel.
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Ezekiel is not pouring out
[1:35:06] my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel is putting my spirit within the
[1:35:10] elect.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Not the rain falling on the just and the
[1:35:15] unjust.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; God does not put his spirit in people
[1:35:19] who will then lose it.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Do you see why the same and not the
[1:35:25] same?
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Right? Let's move on.
[1:35:28] So his spirit upon everyone is all right
[1:35:31] because it helps push an agenda. It
[1:35:34] helps push God's agenda for that age and
[1:35:37] gets the church moving forward. But when
[1:35:39] it comes to the capstone time, it has to
[1:35:42] do with the spirit of God in his people.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; That's what we should be desiring. Amen.
[1:35:49] So uh father, word, son, holy spirit,
[1:35:54] holy ghost and then it must lead to the
[1:35:57] fullness of everything in the bride.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Right? And if we can define the
[1:36:02] differences between father and son, word
[1:36:04] and son, why are we afraid or too
[1:36:07] religious to differentiate between holy
[1:36:09] spirit and holy ghost?
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Let's have a look. What is the holy
[1:36:13] spirit? Right? It is the anointing of
[1:36:16] god given for man. We can start there.
[1:36:19] The Holy Spirit originally worked with
[1:36:22] the spirit of man only originally from
[1:36:25] the Old Testament. After Christ came,
[1:36:27] the Holy Spirit changed to a new
[1:36:30] dispensation. It became the Holy Ghost
[1:36:32] dispensation
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; over church ages. Is that right? And the
[1:36:37] Holy Spirit which once anointed entire
[1:36:40] beings of prophets, high priest, listen.
[1:36:44] Elijah ran before the chariot of Ahab.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has no desire to make you
[1:36:52] do that today.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; There's no reason for that.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Not even to prove something to you,
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; right? Uh so the Holy Spirit anointed
[1:37:02] their entire being. I mean it gave if
[1:37:05] you try to run faster than a horse, your
[1:37:07] heart will pack up in 10 minutes. Not
[1:37:09] even 10 minutes.
[1:37:11] In fact, in 2025, we wouldn't make it
[1:37:13] 100 meters.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; That's how
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; unhealthy we are.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just saying that that's not even
[1:37:22] a normal thing that the human body can
[1:37:24] do. That would have to take the Holy
[1:37:26] Spirit to anoint to give ability to the
[1:37:29] body to do that,
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; right? It's a it's an an abnormal
[1:37:36] ability
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; that we know can only come from God. So
[1:37:40] the Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit
[1:37:44] anointing the flesh of all men and women
[1:37:47] who believe. Agreed? So the Holy Ghost
[1:37:51] was differentiated by the scribes of uh
[1:37:54] the Bible as the Holy Spirit, the same
[1:37:57] Holy Spirit that was in David, the same
[1:37:59] Holy Spirit that anointed Moses. The
[1:38:01] Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit
[1:38:04] except now it's following the word of
[1:38:07] Christ.
[1:38:09] go into the world, baptize them in the
[1:38:12] name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost,
[1:38:14] cast out devils, heal the sick. That's
[1:38:17] the word of Christ. Now, that same Holy
[1:38:19] Spirit that was anointing men to kill
[1:38:21] the enemies, now it's anointing men to
[1:38:24] follow the word of Christ,
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; right? It's not going to go back. Even
[1:38:29] if those people, Peter and Paul and all
[1:38:32] these men being put into prison and uh
[1:38:34] the the the saints being eaten by lions
[1:38:37] and bears in the circus, you know, they
[1:38:39] could have been praying, Lord, give me
[1:38:41] the power to stand up and destroy all
[1:38:43] these gladiators. Go and w you know,
[1:38:46] whack off the head of the emperor of
[1:38:48] Rome and give us the victory. The Holy
[1:38:50] Spirit was not going to do that.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; It's following the word for the day.
[1:38:55] Right.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Barham uses, here's an uh more
[1:38:59] to it. Brother Barham uses both phrases,
[1:39:02] Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit,
[1:39:04] interchangeably as if they are the same.
[1:39:06] That's why I want to tell you young
[1:39:08] people, all we're doing today is just
[1:39:11] simplifying it for you so that you don't
[1:39:14] doubt what you have
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; and you don't judge yourself by other
[1:39:18] people
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; or by some revelation or something of
[1:39:21] some other man. You need to know. And
[1:39:24] and so when they say the Holy Spirit
[1:39:26] here, when brother says the Holy Spirit
[1:39:28] here, know that he's talking about the
[1:39:30] Holy Ghost,
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; the gifts, when he's talking about the
[1:39:33] Holy Ghost here, know that he's talking
[1:39:34] about the baptism.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; But know other places when he's talking
[1:39:38] about here is talking about the person.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Know the difference.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; All right. So, brother taught the
[1:39:47] difference between having the baptism of
[1:39:50] the Holy Ghost and having the person of
[1:39:52] the Holy Ghost.
[1:39:54] Right. Brother Bham also taught that the
[1:39:56] Holy Spirit was once given with measure.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; But the hol the baptism of the Holy
[1:40:02] Ghost is the fullness of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:04] spread over the church.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; How fullness? Some would have a gift of
[1:40:08] this. Others would have a gift of that.
[1:40:10] Not every person has the fullness of the
[1:40:12] gift in one person.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; But the fullness is spread out over the
[1:40:16] entire body of the bride.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. The baptism of the Holy Ghost upon
[1:40:21] a single person is the anointing of the
[1:40:25] Holy Spirit to give a particular ability
[1:40:28] to that believer that is necessary. Not
[1:40:32] even for you.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; It's for God's purpose for the church.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; For other people. The baptism of the
[1:40:41] Holy Ghost given for Peter was so that
[1:40:43] the word could be believed by others.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:51] So there's a purpose behind it. Amen.
[1:40:53] The purpose for vindicating the word to
[1:40:55] others. The Holy Spirit was described as
[1:40:58] that which followed the leading of the
[1:41:01] father ministry. In other words, the Old
[1:41:03] Testament, the Holy Ghost was described
[1:41:06] as that which is following the son's
[1:41:08] ministry.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not going too fast. So this
[1:41:14] is how it all happened. The Holy Spirit
[1:41:17] is an attribute of God. It's just
[1:41:20] English words, right? It's an attribute
[1:41:22] of God which came into manifestation
[1:41:25] when the first man was created to give
[1:41:28] that man power on earth to be God on
[1:41:33] earth. Why? Because he was flesh. If
[1:41:37] he's given the spirit of God, now he
[1:41:40] becomes the vessel of God to fulfill the
[1:41:43] purpose of God. Amen.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Right. So that's why I said the Holy
[1:41:48] Spirit has got to do with man.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; You know when you got that then you
[1:41:53] understand the true mystery of the
[1:41:55] godhead is it becomes in the end time it
[1:41:59] the trinity to the the Catholic is
[1:42:01] father son holy spirit. But when you
[1:42:03] understand what holy spirit is, then you
[1:42:05] find yourself in the godhead.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; Then you know it's father, son, and
[1:42:08] bride
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; complete because the holy spirit was
[1:42:12] given to bring anointing to mankind.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; And you and I must find ourselves in the
[1:42:18] godhead.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; That is the mystery of it.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Tell that to a Catholic, they'll kill
[1:42:24] you.
[1:42:26] When man sinned, he lost constant
[1:42:29] contact with the Holy Spirit along with
[1:42:32] his theophony. Right? As time passed,
[1:42:34] God anointed certain prophets, kings,
[1:42:36] and priests with measure by inspiring
[1:42:40] them by the Holy Spirit to fulfill a
[1:42:42] purpose.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying is Gideon received
[1:42:48] the Holy Spirit to go and do what he had
[1:42:50] to do. And then Gideon went home and
[1:42:54] that which he was inspired with was
[1:42:55] over. Now he was Gideon again.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And Gideon was making mistakes that he
[1:43:00] should not have.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Which means the Holy Ghost came for a
[1:43:06] purpose regarding the word and that's
[1:43:08] it.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; At that time.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then he went back to being
[1:43:13] Gideon again and you know got old and uh
[1:43:17] made mistakes with him and his family
[1:43:19] and took the ephford and people started
[1:43:21] making an idol of it. Is that right?
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Same man who had this great
[1:43:27] manifestation one of the greatest
[1:43:28] battles we read of in the Bible. He had
[1:43:31] the Holy Spirit. How could a man we
[1:43:33] would say how could a man with the Holy
[1:43:35] Spirit go and take the eph and make an
[1:43:37] idol out of it?
[1:43:41] How could Samson having the Holy Spirit
[1:43:43] go and commit adultery knowing that he's
[1:43:46] a Nazerite?
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; And then God still use him, give him the
[1:43:51] Holy Spirit at the right time to bring
[1:43:52] down a temple and then he dies.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; As time passed, God, in other words,
[1:43:59] they received the Holy Spirit for a
[1:44:01] season. They fulfilled their purpose and
[1:44:03] then it passed.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. When Christ came, he changed the
[1:44:10] revelation of God to man. A new
[1:44:14] revelation of God was coming forth. The
[1:44:16] Holy Spirit now could anoint the flesh
[1:44:18] of them that believed on Christ because
[1:44:21] Christ was the the re the mystery of God
[1:44:24] revealed to them.
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Right now, the outpouring of the Holy
[1:44:28] Spirit on a group of people in Acts
[1:44:29] chapter 2 was called for the first time
[1:44:32] the baptism
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. We're going to
[1:44:36] understand what that means in a little
[1:44:38] while. See, I didn't say just now,
[1:44:40] brother.
[1:44:42] The outpouring of the baptism of the
[1:44:44] Holy Ghost upon a group of people was
[1:44:46] given in the Pentecostal age. Right
[1:44:48] there in the beginning, right? And now
[1:44:51] we receive again a baptism of the Holy
[1:44:53] Ghost former and latter reign in the end
[1:44:55] time. That's right.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Right. So the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:59] then has to make way for the person of
[1:45:02] the Holy Ghost to come into the
[1:45:04] believer. Not just an anointing to push
[1:45:07] an agenda, but now to come into the
[1:45:09] believer by the believer accepting and
[1:45:12] believing completely the full revealed
[1:45:15] word for the day.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; They could not do that in all the other
[1:45:19] ages. So the Holy Spirit, the Holy
[1:45:22] Ghost, whatever you want to call him,
[1:45:24] anointing and so on was leading so that
[1:45:27] the eventual person could come into us.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The believer is sealed
[1:45:34] by that Holy Spirit, not the baptism.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; We're going to find that out, too.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; So, this would follow the father to take
[1:45:44] his place and start living and dwelling
[1:45:46] in the soul of man. This is my beloved
[1:45:49] son in whom I am well pleased to dwell
[1:45:51] in. God comes and says in Revelations
[1:45:54] 21, these are my people. I shall be
[1:45:56] their God. I am dwelling with them. I am
[1:45:59] in them. I am dwelling uh in them. I am
[1:46:02] with them. They are my tabernacle.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost can be
[1:46:07] received by those who believe with their
[1:46:10] mind, with their minds and not with
[1:46:12] their heart. The baptism
[1:46:17] because it falls in the just and the
[1:46:19] unjust.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; These make believers can receive the
[1:46:23] Holy Ghost, the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:24] Ghost, and still go to hell.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; But you cannot receive the person
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; and go to hell.
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; Let's look at what and you can go
[1:46:37] through the message. We're drawing it to
[1:46:40] close. You can go through the entire
[1:46:42] message and you can see how the prophet
[1:46:44] targets sensations, right? And speaks
[1:46:46] about sensations. And I love that he's
[1:46:49] done this, right? I'm just showing you
[1:46:51] some statements. I'm not going to put up
[1:46:53] the whole quote, just statements. Look
[1:46:55] at this one. Don't try to have any
[1:46:57] sensation or anything take the place of
[1:47:00] the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; When the new birth is come, you are
[1:47:04] changed.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Don't let sensations take the place of
[1:47:08] the Holy Spirit.
[1:47:10] That's right.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Look at the next one. Every person
[1:47:12] that's been born again of the Holy
[1:47:14] Spirit
[1:47:16] uh truly born, not just thought they
[1:47:18] were born,
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; not went through some emotion, not went
[1:47:21] through some sensation, but was truly
[1:47:23] born. They could have all the emotion
[1:47:26] sensation with it, but you have you
[1:47:29] could have the sensation and emotion and
[1:47:31] not be born.
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; How about this one? God don't want you
[1:47:36] to run after gifts. He wants you to
[1:47:38] thirst after him.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; I I would rather see young people. I
[1:47:45] would rather see that sir
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; because I know that there's a promise
[1:47:49] that comes with thirsting after him.
[1:47:52] &gt;&gt; Him that thirsts after righteousness,
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; hungers and thirsts after righteous, you
[1:47:58] shall be filled.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Go looking for that. Don't run after
[1:48:01] gifts. Don't run after signs. Amen.
[1:48:04] Thirst for him. That's what he wants.
[1:48:07] How about this? We cannot base our
[1:48:10] salvation upon sensations or experiences
[1:48:13] of others or on our own experiences. Uh
[1:48:18] experience. It's you cannot even base
[1:48:20] your salvation on your own experience.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the word of God because
[1:48:26] that's the true mark.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; That's the true mark. You know what he
[1:48:32] speaks about in the in what is the Holy
[1:48:34] Ghost? The Holy Ghost is a mark. It's a
[1:48:37] seal.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; It's an identification of something.
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the word of God is the
[1:48:44] true mark.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Okay. So, I want to
[1:48:48] get to this thought, lost and not lost.
[1:48:52] Okay,
[1:48:54] let's start with having the Holy Ghost
[1:48:56] and going to hell. In leadership, he
[1:48:59] says the choice of your conduct. You
[1:49:02] could you can mix it now. You're either
[1:49:03] of God or against God. And the outward
[1:49:06] expression shows exactly what's on the
[1:49:08] inside. The cocka, many of you think, "I
[1:49:10] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:49:12] going to heaven." That don't mean one
[1:49:14] thing that you're going to heaven. No
[1:49:17] sir. You can have the baptism of the
[1:49:19] Holy Ghost every hour in your life and
[1:49:22] still be lost and go to hell. The Bible
[1:49:25] says so. Uh-huh. That's exactly right.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; I know you've heard this before.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Yeah.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; But this is why it's important to
[1:49:33] separate what it is.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; You can have the anointing
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; every hour in your life and go to hell,
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; not the person.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; And God does not give the person
[1:49:47] willy-nilly to people.
[1:49:50] &gt;&gt; So why was the anointing given? The
[1:49:53] anointing of the same spirit. What is
[1:49:55] anointing? Ability.
[1:49:58] Why is ability given to vindicate the
[1:50:01] word
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; to push a purpose or an agenda? Right?
[1:50:07] How about this one? There's a question
[1:50:10] someone asked, brother Bam. If possible
[1:50:12] for a person to be lost and end up in
[1:50:13] hell if he rejects the light of the word
[1:50:16] even though he has a genuine experience
[1:50:17] of justification and sanctification.
[1:50:20] There's two things in that question.
[1:50:22] Brother Ram said, "Yes, sir. That's
[1:50:23] exactly right.
[1:50:25] You can have a genuine experience of
[1:50:28] justification and sanctification and
[1:50:30] reject the word.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Why was that possible? Because there was
[1:50:36] a time,
[1:50:37] you know, justification is a is a is an
[1:50:41] experience. Sanctification is an
[1:50:43] experience. And this is what people
[1:50:45] struggle with understanding how you can
[1:50:48] have all these experiences and we go
[1:50:50] back in our past and say well I know for
[1:50:53] sure who I am because this on this date
[1:50:55] and so on. We're so good at that. On
[1:50:57] that date and this time this brother did
[1:50:59] this and whatever I remember that was
[1:51:00] the day of my salvation. I'm homeward
[1:51:02] bound. Glory to God.
[1:51:06] How many people have we heard saying
[1:51:07] that and then they come and deny the
[1:51:10] open book
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; and deny the seven seal is open
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; and deny the thunders and place it in
[1:51:16] the future.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; How is how is the Holy Spirit? You can
[1:51:23] have the Holy Ghost and do that.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; But having the Holy Spirit, you will not
[1:51:30] do that.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Do you understand young people? Big
[1:51:34] difference.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; Then look at this one. And I know we
[1:51:38] read the scripture earlier, but let's
[1:51:39] look at what the prophet says. Are you
[1:51:41] still with me?
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Young people, I hope you're catching.
[1:51:46] Ephesians 4:30, which says, "You are
[1:51:48] sealed by the Holy Spirit till the day
[1:51:50] of your redemption." I want you to
[1:51:51] notice what the prophet says. The Holy
[1:51:54] Ghost is God's Easter seal that seals us
[1:51:57] for eternity. Amen. Seals us for
[1:52:01] eternity. Now, this is what I'm pointing
[1:52:02] you to. He's not saying the baptism of
[1:52:05] the Holy Ghost is the Easter Seal.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; This is why he say use it
[1:52:09] interchangeably.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; And I love it because that's why it is
[1:52:13] in mystery form.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; How can you in in one place he says you
[1:52:18] can have the Holy Ghost every hour of
[1:52:20] your life and go to hell.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; But there he says the Holy Ghost is
[1:52:23] God's Easter Seal and seals us for
[1:52:26] eternity.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; And moving on, it says God's Holy
[1:52:30] Spirit.
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:33] Oh, are you glad? Are you glad for
[1:52:35] Easter? Are you glad for this
[1:52:36] experience? Sealed. Shut in with God in
[1:52:39] a secret place. Shut in with God by his
[1:52:41] divine grace. Sealed till the day of our
[1:52:44] redemption. That's the true that's a
[1:52:46] real true Easter seal. So which is true?
[1:52:50] One is the anointing and one is the
[1:52:52] divine nature of the person.
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. However you want to
[1:52:58] say it, they are just words. words that
[1:53:01] people use, words that the prophet used
[1:53:03] interchangeably, but you need to know
[1:53:06] young people clearly what it is
[1:53:09] referring to. And old people are
[1:53:11] starting to doubt your experience.
[1:53:14] You need to know what it means when you
[1:53:16] are reading all those quotes and
[1:53:18] statements because there's going to be
[1:53:19] ministries and people who are going to
[1:53:21] come up and use the same thing and tell
[1:53:23] you that you're supposed to be doing
[1:53:25] this, you're supposed to be having this,
[1:53:26] you're supposed to be feeling this. And
[1:53:28] the worst thing is they're going to
[1:53:29] judge your life and say to you, if you
[1:53:31] have the Holy Spirit, you won't do this.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; If you have the Holy Ghost, you won't do
[1:53:36] this. If you have this, you won't. This
[1:53:38] won't happen. And we start judging one
[1:53:40] another and judging ourselves by that.
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; God is not interested in your feelings
[1:53:47] or your emotions. God is concerned with
[1:53:49] only one thing, his purpose.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to uh finding the middle
[1:53:58] of the road with this. This is the
[1:54:00] message Hebrews chapter 1.
[1:54:03] You still with me?
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Now on this side, when people get
[1:54:06] converted, their minds is set on Christ
[1:54:10] and they're just a little scholarly.
[1:54:13] Amen. And don't keep under prayer, they
[1:54:16] get real cold and stiff and starchy and
[1:54:18] indifferent. And then if they're just a
[1:54:20] little bit nervous, if you I like how he
[1:54:23] says that a little bit nervous. He's
[1:54:25] being so nice. I'm not as nice. If you
[1:54:29] don't watch, they just get radical and
[1:54:31] wild on this side. See? And they go into
[1:54:33] sensations and everything.
[1:54:36] Paragraph 71. But the real church is a
[1:54:40] real sane gospel
[1:54:45] &gt;&gt; right in the middle of the road. It's
[1:54:47] not cold and starchy. Neither is it
[1:54:49] fanaticism. It's a real good old warm
[1:54:53] gospel heartfelt love of God going right
[1:54:57] down the middle of the road calling from
[1:54:59] both sides. That's right. That's what
[1:55:02] how you going to get that church right
[1:55:04] out of the word the urum and thumb.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; What are we saying? All right. So, this
[1:55:10] is where we bring it together. How does
[1:55:12] one stay in the middle of the road with
[1:55:15] sensations? I know how complex we are
[1:55:17] saints. I know what I've been in the
[1:55:20] message since I'm 5 years old, right? Or
[1:55:23] the message was on upon me until I got
[1:55:26] into it, however you want to say it,
[1:55:28] right? But I've seen it. I I've I've
[1:55:31] watched it develop. I've watched the
[1:55:33] people around. I've I've been criticized
[1:55:35] by people from the time I'm a I'm a
[1:55:37] teenager and telling me about this or
[1:55:40] about my dressing or my hairstyle or
[1:55:43] whatever. You know, if you if you had a
[1:55:46] sneaker with white laces, it was
[1:55:48] worldly. If you put colored laces, it
[1:55:50] was worldly. If it was a certain type of
[1:55:53] brand, it was worldly. I mean, you could
[1:55:55] you might as well go barefoot.
[1:55:58] If you used cream in your hair, it's
[1:56:00] worldly. If you left it dry and floppy,
[1:56:03] it's worldly. Everything is just
[1:56:05] worldly. There's like nowhere to walk
[1:56:07] because every single person has a
[1:56:08] different idea about something.
[1:56:11] You know, I told our our church last
[1:56:13] week, some of you have gotten so holy in
[1:56:16] your dressing, you wouldn't have Sister
[1:56:18] Ma in your church.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; You'll kick her out because you gotten
[1:56:24] so holy. Some of you gotten so holy,
[1:56:26] you'll kick Brother out.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; I mean, you should see what's going on
[1:56:31] in Africa.
[1:56:34] We become this people that's like we've
[1:56:36] got these standards that's that's way
[1:56:39] out there that nobody can attain. It's
[1:56:41] like what Christ was telling the
[1:56:42] Pharisees. You put a burden upon the
[1:56:45] people that you yourself won't even uh
[1:56:47] uh push or even lift.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; And we're judging people based on those
[1:56:55] things on the on what? On what our idea
[1:56:58] of the Holy Spirit is.
[1:57:02] How do we find the middle of the road?
[1:57:03] So, here's what happens. Like I'm
[1:57:05] telling you, I've been through this.
[1:57:06] You've got some people who who uh will
[1:57:09] say, "Well, we've got the word, you
[1:57:12] know, and our our song service is
[1:57:15] perfect." And another church comes and
[1:57:16] tells us, "You guys are dead. There's no
[1:57:20] spirit in you." Well, that's based on
[1:57:22] what their interpretation of spirit is.
[1:57:24] And then we will go to their church and
[1:57:26] we say, "Man, these guys don't have the
[1:57:28] spirit. They're so rowdy. This is no
[1:57:30] order. They have this and that. You
[1:57:33] know, I see because even my little
[1:57:34] fellow, my my son is so judgmental
[1:57:39] about us and about other people and
[1:57:40] everything because he's used to
[1:57:42] something his way. I can see it actually
[1:57:43] in the children.
[1:57:46] So, you get under this pressure and I
[1:57:49] like what brother Mhamm says. It's not
[1:57:52] cold and starchy. Neither is it
[1:57:54] fanaticism.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; We've got to pull it together
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; and get the middle of the road.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. There needs to be expression.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; You cannot be an old dead stick
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; in the presence of God. If God has done
[1:58:08] something in your heart, there has to be
[1:58:09] an expression.
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; There has to be an uh even something
[1:58:14] individual.
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; It's quite simple. Be honest with
[1:58:20] yourself first.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Are you feeling what you claim to be
[1:58:24] feeling? If you are having a genuine
[1:58:27] sensation as God's word is proceeding,
[1:58:31] it will manifest itself as the spirit
[1:58:33] within you and will lead you.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; The most important thing, it will be in
[1:58:39] line with the word.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; That's what we got to watch for saints.
[1:58:45] If what you're doing is causing a
[1:58:47] stumbling block or confusion,
[1:58:50] then you have to adjust yourself.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the word will adjust you with
[1:58:54] grace.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is crucial. It should not
[1:58:59] make the church uncomfortable or
[1:59:01] nervous. Your gift should not do that to
[1:59:04] someone.
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; Your expression should not do that to
[1:59:07] someone. It and and you don't stand
[1:59:09] there and you're losing your mind in the
[1:59:12] spirit and then you're nudging someone.
[1:59:13] Come on, be one of us.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; If he just wants to stand there and be
[1:59:18] quiet and just tear come down his eye,
[1:59:20] that's his expression. That's right.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; That the beautiful part of the Holy
[1:59:24] Spirit in each person is it's unique.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; And and God knows our lives. God knows
[1:59:30] our heart. He knows exactly how the word
[1:59:32] in us. He knows what word actually is
[1:59:36] residing in our soul. And our expression
[1:59:38] is going to be based upon that. And
[1:59:40] there's going to be a purpose that God
[1:59:42] has to fulfill through us.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Based on what word you have inside. So
[1:59:46] this is crucial. It should not make the
[1:59:49] church uncomfortable or nervous. Listen,
[1:59:52] the same Holy Ghost that made David
[1:59:55] strip off his clothes and dance before
[1:59:58] the ark is the same Holy Ghost that's
[2:00:00] anointing you to make sure you keep your
[2:00:01] clothes on
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; in the presence of the Lord.
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; But it was necessary that day and the
[2:00:08] person his own wife criticizing him for
[2:00:10] doing that. God judged her for it
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; because it was the anointing of God in
[2:00:15] his life doing that.
[2:00:18] But it won't do that with us today
[2:00:20] because there is a word today
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; that is carrying a different agenda,
[2:00:25] different purpose.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; All right. So, as we close this down,
[2:00:30] there's something we need to look at.
[2:00:33] Baptism and holy. Okay. So, baptism of
[2:00:38] the Holy Ghost. What is baptism? What is
[2:00:40] the meaning of baptism? Okay. It's a
[2:00:43] Jewish concept. It's a Jewish tradition.
[2:00:46] And they used baptism like pouring water
[2:00:49] over Aaron the high priest. It was an
[2:00:52] outward expression of something that was
[2:00:54] being done.
[2:00:56] Inducting him into a body.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; That's what it was for. But what was it
[2:01:02] signifying? Washing.
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Washing away. Washing away what?
[2:01:10] Purging. Purging what? So we know what
[2:01:14] baptism now is. And now what is holy,
[2:01:18] right? Holy means set apart for purpose.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:25] &gt;&gt; Holy has got nothing to do with cood.
[2:01:29] Because if you say be holy as your
[2:01:31] father in heaven is holy.
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; What's that about?
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; The father in heaven doesn't wear
[2:01:39] shorts. That's right.
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to worry about TV or
[2:01:42] music or
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; so what what is the holiness of the
[2:01:46] father?
[2:01:47] &gt;&gt; How are you to be holy as your father in
[2:01:50] heaven is holy? He is holy because he's
[2:01:53] committed to his purpose.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; He is set apart for his purpose.
[2:01:58] &gt;&gt; So if you are holy, it's calling you to
[2:02:01] be set apart for a purpose.
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen people, living right,
[2:02:08] dressing right is reasonable service.
[2:02:10] It's actually common sense.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; You know, um um if you see me standing
[2:02:17] here in a pair of shorts and a torn
[2:02:19] t-shirt and and tattoos all over me and
[2:02:23] an earring and and here am I preaching
[2:02:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. What is
[2:02:27] the efficacy of my message?
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; Where is the the efficiency? Where is
[2:02:33] the the power of my message? My
[2:02:36] presentation of myself is diminishing my
[2:02:39] message.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; So I'm saying that those things are just
[2:02:43] reasonable service. You you can't be um
[2:02:47] uh dressed like a hobo and then go ask
[2:02:50] to be a pilot
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; to fly that plane. The people are going
[2:02:55] to jump off at the moment they see you.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Because you're you're and he could
[2:03:00] actually be a pilot dressed as a hobo.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to trust him.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; You understand? All that has to do with
[2:03:10] making your message more efficient, more
[2:03:12] direct, more powerful.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; But that's got nothing to do with your
[2:03:16] holiness.
[2:03:18] as in are you in your heart dedicated
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; to the purpose of God.
[2:03:25] &gt;&gt; That is holiness.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:03:30] being washed from a previous purpose
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; to induct you into a new purpose.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Washing all previous ambitions and
[2:03:40] purposes away and bringing that's why
[2:03:43] young people that's what it means by be
[2:03:45] baptized with the Holy Ghost means put
[2:03:47] aside your other ambitions.
[2:03:49] &gt;&gt; It means putting away all other whatever
[2:03:52] your career is. And if you're going to
[2:03:53] have a career, your purpose of God is
[2:03:56] going to be included in your career.
[2:04:00] &gt;&gt; See, for example, you can't say I'm the
[2:04:02] bride of Christ and I want to be a
[2:04:04] fashion designer.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Right? in Milan.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; How is that possible?
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; How is the purpose of God included in
[2:04:14] that?
[2:04:15] &gt;&gt; Right? Or I want to be a pastor and a
[2:04:19] full-time fisherman.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; It's it doesn't it doesn't work. It's it
[2:04:25] it doesn't make sense. It it it doesn't
[2:04:28] it doesn't have a a purpose that
[2:04:29] combines,
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; right? So, Holy Spirit and this is where
[2:04:35] I want to close with. What is then Holy
[2:04:39] Spirit? When we break it down, what does
[2:04:42] Holy Spirit actually mean? If holy has
[2:04:45] got to do with purpose and the purpose
[2:04:49] of God and spirit means divine nature or
[2:04:52] nature, then what we have is the
[2:04:55] purposeful nature.
[2:04:58] How do I know I have the Holy Spirit? I
[2:05:01] have the purposeful nature.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; That's what I want.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; I want my life driven by his purpose.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; I want to know what the purpose of God
[2:05:14] is for this day.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Now, if I know what the purpose of God
[2:05:18] is for this day, how am I going to be
[2:05:20] blackmailed by somebody who's telling me
[2:05:22] I need to get the Holy Ghost of another
[2:05:23] day?
[2:05:25] How am I going to be pressurized to act
[2:05:27] like something of another day that has
[2:05:29] got nothing to do with the purpose of
[2:05:31] this day?
[2:05:34] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; So, as we close, what is the purpose of
[2:05:38] your day?
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; And I went unto the angel and said unto
[2:05:43] him, give me the little book. And he
[2:05:45] said unto me, take it.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; And eat it up.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter. So
[2:05:52] you have, if you didn't know about
[2:05:54] something you have to do, here it is.
[2:05:56] Take it and eat it up.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for you.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter, but
[2:06:02] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[2:06:04] And I took the little book out of the
[2:06:05] angel's hand and ate it up. And it was
[2:06:08] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[2:06:09] as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[2:06:11] We all know that. And verse 11 says,
[2:06:13] "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy
[2:06:16] again before many peoples and nations
[2:06:18] and tongues and kings." And this is
[2:06:21] where you got people saying, you see, we
[2:06:23] must prophesy. We must speak with
[2:06:26] tongues. No, you must prophesy to many
[2:06:28] tongues.
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; That means many languages of the earth.
[2:06:31] You must you must prophesy. You must
[2:06:34] speak
[2:06:36] &gt;&gt; to the world.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; There's your purpose for today. So
[2:06:41] what's the purpose? Take the book.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Speak the word.
[2:06:47] This has never been given to any other
[2:06:50] age before.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; This is the purpose of the bride today.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Take the book. Speak the word. There it
[2:06:59] is. So what is your purpose, young
[2:07:01] people? Speaking the word.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Taking the word. Now, this is what I
[2:07:09] find frustrating today
[2:07:11] is that people who are taking the word
[2:07:15] don't seem to be speaking.
[2:07:19] Either you feel pressurized that you're
[2:07:21] not allowed to speak. And I'm not just I
[2:07:23] don't just mean speaking as in with your
[2:07:26] mouth. Of course, you need to. It's
[2:07:28] telling you that the word that you took
[2:07:31] needs to be manifested
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; to all kingdoms and nations and tribes
[2:07:36] and people,
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; to your neighbor in the street,
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; to the people you come in contact with,
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; I feel like
[2:07:47] it needs to change. That's why we're
[2:07:49] feeling like something is missing.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; There needs to be a shift.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; It needs to change. You've got
[2:07:56] Pentecostal people, uh, denominational
[2:07:59] people, they they'll meet you somewhere
[2:08:01] and they'll they'll come up to you and
[2:08:03] say, "Have you been saved? Have you been
[2:08:06] born again?" And and you're thinking
[2:08:08] like, "If only you know." And then you
[2:08:10] walk away.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; What happened to your voice?
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; What happened to your testimony?
[2:08:18] &gt;&gt; What happened to the witnesses?
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; How are we going to fill Revelations
[2:08:21] 10:8-11?
[2:08:23] Number one, you can't do it unless you
[2:08:26] take the book.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; And you need the Holy Spirit to be able
[2:08:30] to take the book. The Holy Spirit is the
[2:08:31] one saying, "Take the book, eat it up.
[2:08:34] This is what's going to happen." You
[2:08:36] take that word in and then you have to
[2:08:37] speak it.
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; You know, when I was uh a young man and
[2:08:43] running away from the ministry, a very
[2:08:46] humble minister who brought correction
[2:08:48] to me told me something. He said, "If
[2:08:50] you take the book and eat the book and
[2:08:53] you have this word inside you and you
[2:08:54] are not
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; speaking it, it's going to corrupt you.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; You're going to be like a well that's
[2:09:01] and it's got no
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; expression. It's got it's not it's not
[2:09:05] releasing itself." And you and I
[2:09:07] understood what was happening because
[2:09:09] there I was sitting in the in the church
[2:09:11] listening to ministry and I'm and I'm
[2:09:13] sitting there and I can feel the
[2:09:15] thoughts of God coming in and I want to
[2:09:16] express it and I'm sitting there
[2:09:18] thinking but this preacher can go this
[2:09:19] way and he can go that way and he could
[2:09:21] say this and and then it's eating me up
[2:09:24] and then it's the why don't you say it
[2:09:27] and no I'm I'm not I'm too good for that
[2:09:30] pulpit.
[2:09:34] That's eventually what comes to you.
[2:09:35] It's your pride standing in the way.
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Humble yourself and speak the word.
[2:09:40] Amen. So you got what they're pushing,
[2:09:44] the agenda they're pushing today outside
[2:09:46] of in in the message is go to these
[2:09:48] camps. Go get slain in the spirit. Go
[2:09:52] speak with tongues. Go jump up and down
[2:09:54] and scream. But are you speaking the
[2:09:56] word? Because the purpose of the day is
[2:09:59] take the book, speak the word.
[2:10:03] &gt;&gt; We've got to find that we've that I
[2:10:05] believe the church needs to lead us into
[2:10:07] that. I believe the the ministry needs
[2:10:10] to lead us into that. Each one of us
[2:10:11] needs to become speakers. And yes, I
[2:10:13] know you say, you know, brother Al, I'm
[2:10:15] just a housewife. What what do I need to
[2:10:18] speak? Well, you are speaking to your
[2:10:21] children.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; You're speaking with your husband.
[2:10:24] You're speaking in your life. You're
[2:10:26] speaking with your friends, with your
[2:10:27] families. It's it's got to come to it
[2:10:30] now where your life is speaking, not
[2:10:32] just your words.
[2:10:33] What do I mean by life? And I'm not even
[2:10:35] talking about the codes and standards of
[2:10:37] the message. I'm talking about your joy
[2:10:40] of the word must be expressed.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Tell it to your face, saints.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. See, it's got to be that.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; I I love his word. I love his word so
[2:10:53] much. I just want to share it. I want to
[2:10:55] fellowship with it. I want unending
[2:10:57] fellowship.
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; We've got to be able to see that. not
[2:11:00] forms of religion but actual loving the
[2:11:03] word. I can't wait to wake up in the
[2:11:05] morning after my sleep. My sleep is
[2:11:06] wasting my time. You know, I want to
[2:11:08] wake up in the morning, open my coffee
[2:11:10] and read the word and and and speak to
[2:11:12] someone and express it today. You know,
[2:11:14] I that's what we want to see in the in
[2:11:16] the bride of Christ. That's what we want
[2:11:17] to see among the people.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; As we close this down, testimony of a
[2:11:22] true witness, paragraph 186. What
[2:11:25] church? What's the That's the reason I
[2:11:27] can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:11:30] of crying, shaking, or speaking in
[2:11:32] tongues or any sensation.
[2:11:35] You hear it straight from the prophet.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; They're all right now. Them things are
[2:11:39] right. But the devil can impersonate
[2:11:41] that so real.
[2:11:44] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost is deity.
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in man. It's more than a
[2:11:51] sensation. It's more than speaking in
[2:11:53] tongues. is more than shouting in the
[2:11:55] spirit. It's more than weeping. It's
[2:11:57] more than joining church. It's God
[2:11:59] living in man deity. God himself
[2:12:02] tabernacled into that person. When he
[2:12:04] can speak, it's just the same as God
[2:12:07] speaking.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; There's the call. He wants you to speak.
[2:12:12] That's the church of Jesus Christ.
[2:12:14] That's the way the first apostolic
[2:12:15] church went forth. Amen. That's this is
[2:12:17] what it is. The prophet is saying, "I
[2:12:20] can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:22] of crying, shaking, speaking tongue,
[2:12:23] sensations.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; What I really want to see is God
[2:12:26] tabernacle deity in men speaking the
[2:12:30] word."
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Uh Corinthians book of correction. We
[2:12:36] notice Paul could teach the Ephesians
[2:12:37] there how that before the foundation of
[2:12:40] the world, they were predestinated unto
[2:12:42] the adoption of sons of God. The
[2:12:44] Corinthians didn't know anything about
[2:12:45] that. They had have a little feeling of
[2:12:48] something, a little sensation, one this
[2:12:50] and that and the other and they depended
[2:12:52] on that. He couldn't teach them the deep
[2:12:55] things.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; Here it is. So I think it's great that
[2:12:59] you got people that you can teach deep
[2:13:01] things. Watch this. Taking the word. The
[2:13:05] Holy Spirit can wind these great truths
[2:13:08] and anchor into the people's heart so
[2:13:10] they know where they're standing.
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; Sensation and no sensation. prophecy or
[2:13:15] no prophecy, whatever it might be, take
[2:13:18] the word, speak the word. The prophet is
[2:13:21] telling us, what I really want to see is
[2:13:23] people you can teach the deep things to.
[2:13:27] &gt;&gt; They're not shunning it. They're willing
[2:13:29] to take it. They're not fighting against
[2:13:31] it. Seventh seal is not open. How can
[2:13:33] this be? How can this must happen in the
[2:13:36] future? Uh the church goes up in
[2:13:38] Revelations 3 and comes back in 19 and
[2:13:40] nothing in between is to the bride.
[2:13:43] They haven't received the Holy Spirit.
[2:13:45] They haven't received the Holy Ghost for
[2:13:47] this day.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; They have not responded to it because
[2:13:50] there's no word inside. Nothing's giving
[2:13:53] ability to even push the agenda.
[2:13:56] &gt;&gt; Right,
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; saints?
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; Why do people feel they need sensations?
[2:14:03] Because they feel they need proof.
[2:14:08] &gt;&gt; Others around them also feel they need
[2:14:10] proof. Like I'm the minister. I need to
[2:14:11] see proof that you have the Holy Ghost.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; It's a private affair.
[2:14:16] &gt;&gt; It's between me and God.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. But even myself now, why do I need
[2:14:22] proof?
[2:14:24] Faith doesn't need proof.
[2:14:27] &gt;&gt; I believe first and evidence follows
[2:14:29] whenever it can.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:31] &gt;&gt; But I must believe.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So people feel insecure,
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; They don't they don't understand what's
[2:14:40] going on. They feel they need proof.
[2:14:42] Their feelings are more satisfied when
[2:14:44] they see evidence, visible evidence.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; Why can I not be like brother so and so?
[2:14:50] You know, he's so lucky. He's got a
[2:14:52] gift. He's got this or speaking with
[2:14:54] tongues or prophesying or he dreams
[2:14:56] dreams. She sees dreams or he's he has
[2:14:58] visions. What about me? I got nothing.
[2:15:02] Right? So I I feel insecure. I feel
[2:15:05] inferior. I need something. The truth is
[2:15:08] saints, emotions and sensations could
[2:15:11] occur in in a way that reflects a true
[2:15:14] experience. It can the the reason should
[2:15:17] be that the body
[2:15:19] cannot contain the revelation that the
[2:15:21] Holy Spirit brings in you. What I'm
[2:15:23] saying to you is
[2:15:25] there should be some expression.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; When you get the word, when God convicts
[2:15:30] your heart, there should be an
[2:15:31] expression.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; There should be an amen in your soul.
[2:15:35] And and maybe you're struggling with
[2:15:37] complex or something and you you really
[2:15:38] want to scream out, but you just maybe
[2:15:41] feel like raising your hand for now.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; And maybe you feel like you're a little
[2:15:46] shy that somebody is seeing you or that
[2:15:49] you're afraid that somebody is going to
[2:15:51] say something, but there's something
[2:15:53] happening inside. And then there's other
[2:15:55] people who are just boisterous,
[2:15:58] flamboyant, sanguin people who it's
[2:16:00] their character that when anything
[2:16:02] touches them, they're just jumping,
[2:16:04] screaming and shouting. It's just
[2:16:05] emotions. It's it's the way they're
[2:16:07] made. They're different. It's emotions.
[2:16:10] It doesn't mean anything
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; to what is going on inside. It's just an
[2:16:16] expression
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; of something.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; But they should be an expression.
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. That expression indicates the
[2:16:24] worship.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; So the reason it is so dangerous, it is
[2:16:28] because people can have reactions for
[2:16:31] the silliest of things and it's not even
[2:16:33] relevant,
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; right? Anyone can cry because they're
[2:16:37] sorry for what they've done.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; That's good because if you cry and
[2:16:42] you're sorry and you apologize for what
[2:16:44] you've done and you come into church and
[2:16:46] the word convicts you and you cry,
[2:16:48] that's good. It's good that you cry.
[2:16:50] It's good that you come and say, "I'm
[2:16:51] sorry, Lord. I repent. You know, I I
[2:16:54] want to put this right. You come and
[2:16:55] tell the pastor or something. You come
[2:16:56] to the altar and and you raise your
[2:16:58] hands. It's good that you do that. It
[2:17:01] still doesn't mean anything
[2:17:04] unless you have the Holy Spirit in you
[2:17:07] directing you to the word
[2:17:09] &gt;&gt; because even a person who does not have
[2:17:11] the Holy Spirit can feel sorry for what
[2:17:13] they did. That's right.
[2:17:16] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is and always has been
[2:17:20] about the purpose of God.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's the purposeful
[2:17:26] nature.
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've had a reaction of
[2:17:30] sensations, then there must be a life of
[2:17:33] purpose that follows.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; All right. I I don't know if I said this
[2:17:39] here before. Most of the people who hit
[2:17:43] the ground in the Bible were
[2:17:44] demonpossessed.
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; Those who willingly went down to the
[2:17:50] ground in the presence of the Lord rose
[2:17:52] up and their lives were never the same
[2:17:54] again.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; They woke up with a purpose.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; They didn't go back to an old lifestyle.
[2:18:00] When Moses bowed his head down because
[2:18:03] the ground he was standing on was holy
[2:18:04] and took off his shoe. When he rose up
[2:18:07] from there, he became a deliverer of a
[2:18:08] nation. He didn't go back to sheep
[2:18:10] farming on the mountain.
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible says the prophet says God
[2:18:15] found him walking around living a life
[2:18:17] of ease.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; This prophet
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; and then he meets the presence of God
[2:18:24] hits the ground in the presence of God
[2:18:25] wakes up with a purpose.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; So if there is an experience or there is
[2:18:29] an expression or there is some kind of
[2:18:32] experience of the Holy Ghost your life
[2:18:34] must have purpose
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; from there on. Amen.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to see. It is a
[2:18:40] purposeful nature.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that saints?
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; If you had a reaction of sensations,
[2:18:48] there must be purpose. That must be
[2:18:50] evident.
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Everyone can be anointed with the
[2:18:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the
[2:18:54] earnest. But the Holy Spirit of promise
[2:18:59] does not come upon a person willy-nilly.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; It comes to the elect.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is it has a purpose. It has a
[2:19:07] directive. It leads to something in
[2:19:09] particular. It is the beginning of the
[2:19:12] process of adoption of a son.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're under tutors and
[2:19:19] governors. Go read Galatians chapter 4.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; A son, as long as he's not come to
[2:19:25] maturity, he's just a servant
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; and he's under tutors and governors. But
[2:19:29] then when it comes to the end, he
[2:19:31] receives the spirit
[2:19:33] of the son,
[2:19:36] not gifts. He was under gifts all the
[2:19:39] time, tutors and governors. But now when
[2:19:42] it comes to the process of adoption to
[2:19:44] take purpose
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the will of the father to
[2:19:51] come into that state of adoption you
[2:19:53] have to have the holy spirit within you
[2:19:56] not an anointing the divine nature the
[2:19:59] purpose of god to fulfill the work of
[2:20:02] the father to be an heir of all things.
[2:20:05] It signifies a closing of being under
[2:20:08] tutors and governors and becoming an
[2:20:10] heir of the promise. Saints,
[2:20:13] if we have the full fullness of the
[2:20:16] word, why do we need the baptism of the
[2:20:19] Holy Ghost in operation? I'm not saying
[2:20:22] you mustn't. I'm asking you a question.
[2:20:24] You say, brother Alistister, okay, look,
[2:20:25] we got the fullness of the word now. We
[2:20:27] got the open book. Doesn't that mean we
[2:20:29] don't need the baptism of the Holy
[2:20:30] Ghost? No. You still need ability. The
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost gives ability
[2:20:36] for the present day.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; So that's what anointing is. It is
[2:20:40] ability. Otherwise, we're just sitting
[2:20:42] around doing nothing,
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; right? With all this word feeding us and
[2:20:47] then sitting around doing nothing. You
[2:20:49] need anointing to incentivize you to
[2:20:52] give you direction what you what you
[2:20:53] need to do. It's like at a certain time
[2:20:55] you meet somebody, I don't know whether
[2:20:58] you use a bus stop here in Lima or
[2:21:00] wherever at the grocery store or
[2:21:01] something and somebody comes up to you
[2:21:03] and they notice something about you,
[2:21:05] something unique and they they seem to
[2:21:07] sense there's something different about
[2:21:08] you and they speak to you right there.
[2:21:10] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:21:11] important
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; because it needs to give you ability
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; to speak to this person, to see their
[2:21:17] soul, to sense what's going on, to speak
[2:21:20] the right word because you in your right
[2:21:21] mind, you're still worrying about what's
[2:21:23] happening, about the bills, about
[2:21:24] something that crashed into your car.
[2:21:26] And and right there, you're all
[2:21:28] flustered, you're confused, you're
[2:21:30] looking at a pawpaw and wondering
[2:21:31] whether you should buy it. And someone
[2:21:33] comes up and says, "Hi, I need some
[2:21:37] help.
[2:21:38] You need the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:21:40] to put all those worries away and focus
[2:21:42] your attention because there's something
[2:21:45] calling and there must be a deep to
[2:21:47] respond.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. There always is a need for
[2:21:52] ability.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; But we don't take the ability and make
[2:21:56] it our God.
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is his holy spirit in us which
[2:22:02] is the divine nature that leads us to
[2:22:05] it. So the word is what your soul, if
[2:22:07] you understand who you are, the word in
[2:22:10] your soul is what you are married to.
[2:22:12] This flesh and your mind is not married
[2:22:16] to that word.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; This flesh and this mind needs the
[2:22:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Young people
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; because this flesh and this body and
[2:22:25] mind has different abilities. In my
[2:22:27] life, I had abilities of playing
[2:22:28] cricket, being a sportsman, doing art,
[2:22:32] playing music. You know, playing music
[2:22:35] is a very dangerous thing. If you if you
[2:22:37] have gift or play by ear, you can pick
[2:22:39] up all sorts of tunes and play it. But
[2:22:41] when you get the Holy Ghost, you're
[2:22:42] going to dedicate that gift to only his
[2:22:44] purpose.
[2:22:46] &gt;&gt; See, but without the Holy Ghost, you're
[2:22:48] just going to drift anywhere with it.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; Right? Those abilities need to be
[2:22:52] reigned in to be used for the purpose of
[2:22:55] the word. Amen.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word is what your soul is
[2:23:00] married to. But this animal needs the
[2:23:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:23:05] &gt;&gt; This animal needs the anointing. And the
[2:23:08] anointing is what gives it abilities it
[2:23:11] could not ordinarily have. That's why
[2:23:14] it's important. Anyone can be anointed
[2:23:16] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[2:23:18] which is the earnest. But the Holy
[2:23:20] Spirit of promise comes to the elect.
[2:23:22] You believe him, saints? That's why the
[2:23:25] Holy Spirit is necessary. What is the
[2:23:27] Holy Spirit then? It is the influence of
[2:23:32] the word for your day.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; The purposeful nature.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; Spirit is nature. The Holy Spirit is the
[2:23:41] influence of the word for your day. And
[2:23:45] that influence is going to cause your
[2:23:47] body and your spirit to fall in line
[2:23:50] with the word that you are married to.
[2:23:52] Yes.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's understand that we came into
[2:23:55] this flesh. Uh born in sin, shapen in
[2:23:59] iniquity, come into this world speaking
[2:24:01] lies as the prophet said. We we uh come
[2:24:05] with our own desires. We have our own
[2:24:07] ideas of things. We have our own way of
[2:24:09] doing things. We sometimes think, well,
[2:24:11] I'm just going to preach this this way
[2:24:13] and you know, people just have to accept
[2:24:15] it and uh this is how I do things. But
[2:24:18] it becomes ineffective unless the Holy
[2:24:20] Spirit is the one guiding us.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand
[2:24:26] why they wrote it differently in the
[2:24:28] Bible?
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference? Do you
[2:24:32] understand the difference between the
[2:24:34] anointing and the person?
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference between
[2:24:38] the ability and the purposeful nature?
[2:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; Now, you need to know when you read the
[2:24:45] word, what it is that you have, what it
[2:24:48] is that you seek,
[2:24:50] &gt;&gt; what it is that God must give to you,
[2:24:52] what it is that you are lacking. Maybe
[2:24:54] if you have a desire in your heart to do
[2:24:56] something for the gospel, you need
[2:24:58] ability for that. And you need and God's
[2:25:01] ability is not going to be one that must
[2:25:03] bring failure. It must be a success for
[2:25:06] the kingdom.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're you other a lot of
[2:25:10] people also feel like I want to I want
[2:25:13] to be a preacher but there's just no
[2:25:14] gift there. I want to be a pastor but
[2:25:16] there's just no wisdom in you. I want to
[2:25:19] be a deacon but you're just a big old
[2:25:21] softy who's never going to be able to
[2:25:22] correct anybody.
[2:25:24] And yet in a time of need God can give
[2:25:27] you the Holy Ghost to fulfill that need
[2:25:31] because the word has inspired you beyond
[2:25:33] what you what abilities you have. Yes.
[2:25:37] Sometimes a big old softy can be someone
[2:25:39] who can bring good correction.
[2:25:42] &gt;&gt; God can do that. Only God can change you
[2:25:44] and people the people will recognize the
[2:25:46] spirit of God has worked in his life.
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; You love him saints.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; This is the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[2:25:54] Spirit. The purposeful nature of God.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:02] Glory to God. Let us pray. The musicians
[2:26:06] can come up.
[2:26:09] Dear heavenly father,
[2:26:11] we love you, Lord, with all that is
[2:26:13] within us.
[2:26:15] We give you praise,
[2:26:17] Lord, because you are more than more
[2:26:20] than worthy of all the praise and the
[2:26:22] glory.
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord. And yet in our our
[2:26:28] minds and our heart,
[2:26:31] Lord, we we may not be able to describe
[2:26:34] it or even to know
[2:26:36] or even define so many things about our
[2:26:39] lives.
[2:26:41] But we know one thing. You sent us a
[2:26:44] perfect word. When we look at where
[2:26:47] we've come from, we are reminded that
[2:26:50] you took us from the sheep coat.
[2:26:53] We were people that nobody knew, nobody
[2:26:56] cared for, nobody
[2:27:00] ever thought that we would amount to
[2:27:02] anything. We're still our people in this
[2:27:05] world. People pass us by. We come to
[2:27:08] this place. We are reminded we are the
[2:27:10] bride of Christ. We are the super race.
[2:27:13] We are the the elect.
[2:27:18] And then we drive around in our vehicles
[2:27:19] and go to the shopping markets and malls
[2:27:23] and nobody knows we even exist. Nobody
[2:27:28] cares.
[2:27:30] There's nothing special about us. And we
[2:27:33] look at this and we think, but Peter and
[2:27:37] Paul and those men walked around and
[2:27:39] there was such a great significance.
[2:27:41] Shouldn't there be something that we
[2:27:43] must do? Shouldn't there be something,
[2:27:44] some effect we must make on the world?
[2:27:48] Lord, we we understand.
[2:27:51] We know the time we are living in. Your
[2:27:54] word has been revealed to us.
[2:27:57] Yet, we know there are the
[2:28:00] denominations, the people on the
[2:28:01] outside. Many others would say, well, if
[2:28:06] you are the the chosen people of God,
[2:28:09] why does nobody listen to you? What are
[2:28:11] you doing for the world? How are you
[2:28:13] changing the world? And it gets to us.
[2:28:17] It convicts us. It makes us feel like we
[2:28:20] have to do something.
[2:28:24] But you know why you chose barren woman
[2:28:28] to be the woman of promise to bring
[2:28:31] forth the seed.
[2:28:34] Lord, we were barren for such a long
[2:28:37] time.
[2:28:39] We were people who could not bring
[2:28:41] forth. We were people who thought it was
[2:28:45] nothing to us and others told us that we
[2:28:49] were condemned. We came from families
[2:28:51] who cast us out and persecuted us for
[2:28:55] what we believed.
[2:28:57] But you built us up by your word. You
[2:29:00] brought us the truth. You gave us your
[2:29:02] spirit. You gave us this anointing.
[2:29:06] You gave us your word. You revealed the
[2:29:08] word to us, oh Lord.
[2:29:11] Now we stand before a world and your
[2:29:15] your spirit has shouted out to us. Go
[2:29:18] take the book, eat the book, speak the
[2:29:22] word.
[2:29:25] We know what the purpose is in this last
[2:29:27] days. Lord, I pray I pray for this
[2:29:31] church. I pray for our church. I pray
[2:29:33] for our families. my wife, my children,
[2:29:37] myself,
[2:29:39] my families, my siblings, my friends,
[2:29:43] those of us in in the message.
[2:29:46] Lord, it it looks like we're waiting for
[2:29:49] something to happen.
[2:29:52] We're preaching that something has, but
[2:29:55] it looks like we're waiting on
[2:29:56] something.
[2:29:58] It feels like we're waiting on
[2:30:00] something. And yet, Lord, you have
[2:30:02] commissioned us to do something.
[2:30:06] I pray for the young people. I pray for
[2:30:09] those who have been discouraged. I
[2:30:11] commit us all to you. Lord,
[2:30:14] I am in desperation.
[2:30:18] I am a minister. I'm a pastor of a
[2:30:20] church. But Lord, I need your guidance.
[2:30:24] I need your wisdom. I need your
[2:30:26] strength. I need to know what to do
[2:30:28] tomorrow. I need to do know what to do
[2:30:30] with my life. I need to know what to do
[2:30:32] for the next 10 years of my life. should
[2:30:34] you tarry? What must I do with your
[2:30:36] word? How can I bring this word to your
[2:30:39] people? How can I incentivize your
[2:30:41] children? How can I help to build your
[2:30:45] children up to to bring them to a place
[2:30:47] where they can speak the word fearlessly
[2:30:50] and share this wonderful truth with
[2:30:53] those around them?
[2:30:55] Lord God, I pray that you would anoint
[2:30:59] your children once again.
[2:31:02] Bring that purposeful spirit within us,
[2:31:06] Lord, that we might have direction. We
[2:31:08] might have purpose. That we might be
[2:31:10] holy even as you are holy.
[2:31:13] I want to be committed to your purpose,
[2:31:15] oh God. Not my own agenda, not my own
[2:31:18] ambitions, not my own career. I want my
[2:31:21] will to be aligned with your will.
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; I want to have the ability to choose
[2:31:27] your will for my life's path.
[2:31:31] Lord, I don't want to walk my own way. I
[2:31:34] want to be anointed by your Holy Spirit.
[2:31:37] I want to have your Holy Spirit dwelling
[2:31:39] within me and giving me the direction I
[2:31:41] need. Lord God, I pray for all these
[2:31:45] your children bowed in your presence
[2:31:46] today. Anoint us, oh Lord. Bring us to
[2:31:49] that place where we are no longer
[2:31:51] confused, where we are not trapped by
[2:31:54] the enemy to trying to make us think
[2:31:56] that we should have some anointing for a
[2:31:58] different day.
[2:32:00] Lord, make us realize what it is that
[2:32:02] you have for us today.
[2:32:05] Bless us today, Father God, as we leave
[2:32:06] this place. Let these few simple things
[2:32:10] make things clearer for us. That we
[2:32:12] might understand, that we might follow
[2:32:14] behind the word for this day. That we
[2:32:16] might see what the anointing should be
[2:32:19] around the word that you have revealed
[2:32:21] for us. Bless the pastor of this church.
[2:32:24] Bless the people.
[2:32:26] Lord, we all need help. We all need
[2:32:28] strength to continue and we believe that
[2:32:32] you will lead us through to the very
[2:32:34] end. Bless us now, Father. We ask it in
[2:32:37] your precious name with much praise and
[2:32:39] thanksgiving. Amen. And amen.
[2:32:44] Praise be to God.
[2:32:46] Let's sing that song. Holy Spirit, thou
[2:32:48] would welcome in this place as brother
[2:32:50] Chad would come.
[2:32:53] [Music]
[2:32:56] Holy
[2:32:58] Spirit, Holy Spirit,
[2:33:00] thou art well.
[2:33:04] Come in
[2:33:06] this place.
[2:33:09] Holy Spirit,
[2:33:12] thou art well.
[2:33:15] Amen.
[2:33:18] This we stand and raise our hands.
[2:33:25] Father
[2:33:28] of mercy
[2:33:30] and grace,
[2:33:33] thou are welcome
[2:33:37] in
[2:33:39] this place.
[2:33:43] One more time.
[2:33:45] Holy Spirit
[2:33:48] now and well
[2:33:51] in
[2:33:53] this place.
[2:33:56] Holy Spirit,
[2:33:59] thou art welcome
[2:34:03] in
[2:34:05] this place.
[2:34:08] Omnipotent
[2:34:12] Father
[2:34:14] of mercy
[2:34:17] and grace.
[2:34:20] Thou art welcome
[2:34:22] [Music]
[2:34:23] in
[2:34:25] this place.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:32] Man, we're going to sing that song
[2:34:33] again, but as we do, I think you're all
[2:34:36] thinking the same thought as me. We
[2:34:38] don't want him to be welcome in this
[2:34:39] building.
[2:34:41] We want him to be welcome in this place.
[2:34:44] When we sing it, we want to sing it. You
[2:34:46] know, the Bible says that you shall
[2:34:48] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And
[2:34:51] remember, I remember uh uh I think it
[2:34:54] was brother Charlie Cox in his
[2:34:55] testimony. Brother Brenham had preached
[2:34:58] a series that uh brother Alistister
[2:35:00] quoted from. What is the Holy Ghost and
[2:35:03] what is the Holy Ghost given for? And
[2:35:05] during that series, Charlie Cox, he
[2:35:07] wanted to receive the baptism of the
[2:35:08] Holy Ghost so bad. He just couldn't
[2:35:11] break through. He would go out and walk
[2:35:12] in the woods and and and he just
[2:35:15] couldn't seem to get it. And he went to
[2:35:17] brother Brandham and he asked Brother
[2:35:18] Brandham about it. And this is in
[2:35:20] Charlie Cox's testimony. And brother, he
[2:35:22] asked him, "Why can't I seem to get it?"
[2:35:24] And brother Bham just stopped for a
[2:35:26] minute.
[2:35:27] And then he then he answered Charlie. He
[2:35:29] said, "Charlie, you know when you're out
[2:35:30] walking in the woods and praying and you
[2:35:32] know you feel that sweet presence around
[2:35:34] you." He said, "That's him. Just open
[2:35:37] your heart and let him in. That's it."
[2:35:40] Charlie said he went back the next time
[2:35:42] he went to pray and as he went on the
[2:35:44] woods and prayed, he felt that sweet
[2:35:45] presence and he says then he just opened
[2:35:47] it. He said, "I got it." Brother Ren
[2:35:49] made it so easy because it's a gift.
[2:35:53] you're repentant or baptized in the name
[2:35:55] of the Lord Jesus Christ, you shall
[2:35:56] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. And
[2:35:58] a gift is something given, but a gift is
[2:36:00] something that has to be received.
[2:36:03] How many want to be baptized, washed
[2:36:06] from all your own thinking and all your
[2:36:08] own ideas and separated, washed away
[2:36:10] from everything else that's carnal and
[2:36:12] everything else that I ever had. and
[2:36:14] wants to receive another nature that
[2:36:16] lines up with God's nature and give our
[2:36:19] tabernacle for him to live his life
[2:36:22] inside of us. Amen. If we have that
[2:36:25] desire with all of our hearts, just open
[2:36:27] up and let that desire be known to God
[2:36:29] and let him come in and take possession
[2:36:31] of us and let him anoint us for that
[2:36:33] purpose and let him drive our lives in
[2:36:36] the purpose of his word. Amen. Let's
[2:36:39] just sing that song again. But don't
[2:36:40] make it this place.
[2:36:43] Make it this place. Amen. Let's sing
[2:36:45] that once again. Brother Blake. Holy
[2:36:48] Spirit,
[2:36:50] thou art welcome
[2:36:54] in
[2:36:56] this place.
[2:36:59] Holy Spirit,
[2:37:02] thou art welcome
[2:37:06] in
[2:37:08] this place.
[2:37:11] A pivot
[2:37:14] father
[2:37:17] of mercy
[2:37:19] and grace.
[2:37:22] Thou are welcome
[2:37:26] in
[2:37:28] this place.
[2:37:30] [Music]
[2:37:33] Holy Spirit,
[2:37:36] thou art welcome
[2:37:40] in
[2:37:42] this place.
[2:37:45] Holy Spirit,
[2:37:48] thou art welcome
[2:37:51] in
[2:37:53] this place.
[2:37:57] Our fifant
[2:38:00] father
[2:38:02] of mercy
[2:38:05] and grace.
[2:38:07] thou art welcome
[2:38:11] in
[2:38:13] this place.
[2:38:17] Let's just bow our heads together as we
[2:38:19] close their heavenly father. Lord Jesus,
[2:38:22] we thank you for speaking to us of your
[2:38:25] word again, Lord.
[2:38:28] And God, I pray that you would help us,
[2:38:30] Lord, to just open our hearts to you, to
[2:38:32] surrender more than we've ever
[2:38:34] surrendered before,
[2:38:36] God. that you would give us a true
[2:38:37] revelation of your word and what you're
[2:38:39] trying to do in each one of us. And may
[2:38:42] we surrender to that purpose, Lord.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; God, may we catch the revelation of what
[2:38:47] you want. Lord, we want your anointing
[2:38:49] upon our lives absolutely every day. But
[2:38:52] God, we know we need more than just an
[2:38:54] anointing. We need your very person
[2:38:56] inside of us, Lord. We need you to
[2:38:58] quicken the life that you placed in us
[2:39:00] before the foundation of the world. We
[2:39:02] need you to marry to us, Lord. To be
[2:39:04] married, to be joined as one with our
[2:39:06] souls, Lord. God, we need the anointing
[2:39:10] every day of our lives, but we need the
[2:39:11] anointing to bring life, Lord. Life
[2:39:14] within us, your life inside of us, Lord.
[2:39:17] And God, I pray that you would, Lord,
[2:39:19] fill us with your spirit. That you would
[2:39:21] quicken us to life. That you would unify
[2:39:24] yourself with your attribute that's in
[2:39:26] us. And that you would abide in us,
[2:39:29] Lord. that you would take up a residence
[2:39:31] in us. That we would be tabernacling
[2:39:34] deity, Lord. That the reality of the
[2:39:37] message would be alive in us. That it
[2:39:39] wouldn't be something that we just
[2:39:40] believe, but it would be something that
[2:39:41] we are, Lord. That we become one with
[2:39:44] the word and we become the word by
[2:39:46] allowing you access to us. And God, with
[2:39:50] that, we need your anointing every day
[2:39:52] of our lives so that we can manifest
[2:39:54] your life and your purpose.
[2:39:57] God, let your spirit abide in us and on
[2:40:00] us and all around us. Inspire us, anoint
[2:40:04] us, quicken us, use us, and live your
[2:40:06] life inside of us, Lord. God, we want to
[2:40:10] surrender. We want to die out. We want
[2:40:12] to give up everything that's not holy,
[2:40:15] that's not sanctified and set aside and
[2:40:18] dedicated for your purpose. We want to
[2:40:19] die to all of that. Wash it away from
[2:40:22] us, Lord, with the baptism of the Holy
[2:40:24] Ghost, with the Holy Ghost in fire. burn
[2:40:26] out of us every wrong desire and every
[2:40:28] wrong vision of our lives and every
[2:40:30] wrong purpose that we've gained through
[2:40:32] this world. And may you burn into us
[2:40:34] that one vision, that one purpose, that
[2:40:37] desire you had of us before the
[2:40:38] foundation of the world. May we receive
[2:40:41] it now, Lord. May you fill all your
[2:40:44] children. May you anoint anoint us for
[2:40:46] that purpose you've called us to. May we
[2:40:49] walk in that anointing and in that
[2:40:51] purpose. God, I pray that you would
[2:40:53] bless, Lord, your children. Bless our
[2:40:55] brother Alistister and his wife. Lord,
[2:40:58] as they continue their journey with more
[2:41:00] ministry before they go home, I pray you
[2:41:02] watch over them and use them. And may
[2:41:04] you bless them and inspire him again.
[2:41:07] And for each one of us, Lord, as we walk
[2:41:09] out of here, may we walk out, Lord, with
[2:41:11] a clear vision and understanding of what
[2:41:13] you're trying to do in this hour, what
[2:41:16] your desire is, what your heart is, and
[2:41:17] what your your heart for us is. and may
[2:41:21] it be manifest and fulfilled in each one
[2:41:23] of us. Lord, we surrender to you. We
[2:41:26] give ourselves to you. We ask for
[2:41:29] everything that was preached to be a
[2:41:30] living reality inside of us, Lord. For
[2:41:33] we surrender to that purpose. I love
[2:41:36] you, Lord. I thank you God for this
[2:41:38] message of this hour for the awakening
[2:41:41] Lord for you sharing your heart the the
[2:41:44] mystery you had of yourself in the back
[2:41:46] part of your mind and how you shared it
[2:41:48] with us because we are part of that
[2:41:50] mystery may it become more of a reality
[2:41:53] to us every hour of the day we love you
[2:41:57] Lord we thank you for your love we thank
[2:42:00] you for living in this hour when these
[2:42:02] things are possible Lord we thank you
[2:42:05] for a word that is washed us, for your
[2:42:08] spirit that has cleansed us, Lord, for
[2:42:10] for your presence that will fill us and
[2:42:13] live in us. God, we appreciate so much
[2:42:17] the things you've allowed us to hear.
[2:42:19] And may they become our experience,
[2:42:21] Lord. Pray your pleasant presence would
[2:42:24] be with your people as we go from here.
[2:42:26] And may this living reality grow in us
[2:42:29] day by day. Oh, we love you. We thank
[2:42:32] you. We ask your blessings over it all.
[2:42:35] In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[2:42:40] Amen. God bless you all. Been such a
[2:42:42] privilege to worship God with you. Amen.
[2:42:45] It's been such a privilege to hear the
[2:42:47] word of God. Amen. But I don't want to
[2:42:50] be a hearer only. I want to be a doer. I
