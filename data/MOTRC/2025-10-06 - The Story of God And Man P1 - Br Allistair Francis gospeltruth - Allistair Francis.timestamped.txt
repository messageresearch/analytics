[0:00] Amen. While you're standing,
[0:03] we're going to speak on the subject of
[0:06] the story of God and man.
[0:10] And for a title, from eternity through
[0:14] time to eternity.
[0:17] Amen. To me, this I think there's a
[0:20] quote where brother Brandham says, "This
[0:22] is the gospel story."
[0:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. how God wanted to become man so
[0:28] that man could become God.
[0:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; And he says if anything that is the
[0:32] gospel story. So we like to read several
[0:35] portions of scripture. We we'll begin
[0:37] with Psalm 8:38.
[0:40] I just want you to consider the words of
[0:43] the psalmists and those who have written
[0:45] the scriptures. And for you to
[0:48] understand that these questions are not
[0:50] questions we ask now.
[0:53] They've been questions that man has been
[0:54] asking for generations.
[0:57] And when we read these verses, they
[0:59] should become more meaningful to us
[1:01] today because we have been drawn in by
[1:03] the word of this day. The psalmist says,
[1:06] "When I consider thy heavens and the
[1:08] work of thy fingers, the moon and the
[1:10] stars which thou has ordained, what is
[1:13] man that thou art mindful of him? And
[1:16] the son of man that thou visitest him?
[1:18] For thou has made him a little lower
[1:20] than the angels, and hast crowned him
[1:22] with glory and honor.
[1:24] Thou madeest him uh to have dominion
[1:27] over the works of thy hands. Thou has
[1:29] put all things under his feet, all sheep
[1:32] and oxmen, yay, in the beasts of the
[1:34] field, the fowl of the air, the fish of
[1:36] the seas, and whatsoever passeth through
[1:39] the parts of the seas. Job 7 verse 17
[1:42] to18.
[1:44] Again, what is man that thou shouldest
[1:46] magnify him, and that thou shouldest set
[1:49] thine heart upon him, and that thou
[1:52] shouldest visit him every morning, and
[1:54] try him every moment? Job 15:14-16.
[1:58] Again, what is man that he should be
[2:01] clean, and he which is born of a woman
[2:04] that should be righteous? Behold, he
[2:06] putth no trust in his saints, yay, the
[2:08] heavens are not clean in his sight. How
[2:11] much more abominable and filthy is man
[2:13] which drinkketh iniquity like water?
[2:17] Psalm 144:3 to4.
[2:20] Lord, what is man that thou takest
[2:22] knowledge of him? Or the son of man that
[2:25] thou makest account of him? Man is like
[2:28] to vanity. His days are as a shadow that
[2:32] passeth away. The Lord bless the reading
[2:34] of his word. You may be seated.
[2:38] We'd like to greet you in the precious
[2:40] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:42] Christ. Amen. We'd like to welcome
[2:43] Sister Norma, that is brother Joseph's
[2:45] wife. God bless you, sister. Uh happy to
[2:48] have you with us. And uh if there be any
[2:50] other uh visitors among us in our gates,
[2:53] may the Lord be with you and bless you
[2:54] today. So just before we begin this
[2:58] subject, I just want to say we we've had
[3:00] a really uh wonderful week at first with
[3:05] the the Sunday school and then the youth
[3:07] on Friday and um we started uh the
[3:11] subject with the Sunday school on on on
[3:14] Sunday evening or Sunday afternoon just
[3:16] making the word more plain and um so
[3:20] what I'm going to be speaking on today
[3:22] is
[3:25] repeating some of that and it's there's
[3:27] going to be a lot of pictures pictures
[3:30] uh that are related to things that make
[3:33] it easier for uh for the young the young
[3:36] ones the children. So I realized that
[3:39] and and that's what we kind of doing
[3:40] with uh with the youth. We want to work
[3:43] with them in a specific way and as um
[3:46] time has gone by. I've been in the
[3:48] message since uh I'm a little child and
[3:52] I've seen things and I've seen how
[3:53] things work. And I realized that if you
[3:56] tell the little ones the truth, you tell
[3:59] them heaven is right here. You tell it
[4:02] to them now, then when they grow up and
[4:05] you preach the seventh seal, they're not
[4:07] expecting them
[4:09] to fly up in the clouds. They're not
[4:11] expecting Christ because they know
[4:13] heaven is a dimension right in here
[4:15] where you you can't see it but it's
[4:17] right here in hell and what it is. So we
[4:19] and and you make a mistake thinking
[4:21] these children cannot comprehend such
[4:23] things. They're only deep to you cuz
[4:26] you've already been indoctrinated.
[4:29] It's so simple. I tell you when we speak
[4:31] to the little ones they just accept it.
[4:34] They just believe it. There's no mystery
[4:37] in their minds. They're yes. Okay. And
[4:39] the questions, so what dimension is this
[4:41] body? What dimension is this? And what
[4:42] dimens? And you give them an answer,
[4:44] they say, okay, no problem. But if you
[4:47] speak to adults who have been
[4:48] indoctrinated their whole lives, it's a
[4:51] it's like that concept is too difficult
[4:53] for me to understand. So it's not even
[4:56] really deep to these children. So we
[4:59] realize that uh and that's what we're
[5:01] looking towards um
[5:04] maybe catching them at that young age
[5:06] and teach them the things of God. And
[5:08] let me tell you, they're grasping it.
[5:10] And then we'll get to the the age groups
[5:12] of maybe between uh 10 and 15
[5:17] uh and catch them before their hormones
[5:19] start raging. And that's the perfect
[5:22] time to fill them with the word. Get
[5:24] them to know their Bible. Get them to
[5:26] know their their the message because
[5:29] once they're 16, now they're distracted
[5:31] by what their hormones are doing to
[5:33] them. So, I think uh it's a problem
[5:36] waiting for them to get to know the
[5:38] message after they're 16. We need to get
[5:40] them while they're still stable.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; So, that's what we're looking to do. And
[5:46] maybe if we we we'll split up split them
[5:49] up into three groups and we're quite
[5:51] excited with uh some initiatives that's
[5:54] coming up. So, we appreciate um that we
[5:58] can still have this time to work with
[5:59] our children. Amen.
[6:02] So, uh, with that in mind, I want to I
[6:06] want to explain something. We have I've
[6:09] preached this message.
[6:11] It's going to be 20 27 years or so I've
[6:15] been preaching. And something that
[6:17] really impressed me in my heart from
[6:19] from a very young age is that God must
[6:24] never be an idol to me because the
[6:26] entire scripture is that he must not be
[6:30] an idol because an idol is worshiped in
[6:32] a certain way.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; And the way an idol is worshiped is
[6:36] limited. But if you see God beyond an
[6:40] idol and the Bible tells you he is a
[6:43] spirit
[6:44] &gt;&gt; and they that worship must worship in
[6:46] spirit and in truth
[6:48] &gt;&gt; and if you see God as an idol you will
[6:50] not worship him in truth and you cannot
[6:52] fully worship him in spirit because it
[6:55] becomes a mental understanding
[6:58] &gt;&gt; so it must go beyond that. So that's
[7:00] always been my found foundation point
[7:02] and it affected me in a way because I'm
[7:04] a I'm a person who when I when I study I
[7:08] draw on a whiteboard and I I'm very
[7:10] pictorial. I draw pictures and I I I put
[7:13] diagrams up and I align my thoughts and
[7:16] so that I can I can keep a thought
[7:18] through a whole service. I can preach a
[7:19] three-hour service and hold your
[7:21] attention because I'm keeping to a
[7:23] thought and I'm leading you somewhere.
[7:25] But if I was all random men everywhere
[7:27] then we'd have a problem.
[7:30] So the problem with pictures is when you
[7:33] implant a picture in someone's mind,
[7:35] it's that easy to make an idol.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; True.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; So when I started off preaching the
[7:40] message and I began to draw pictures and
[7:43] talk about concepts, I would never draw
[7:46] the image of God in a certain way so as
[7:49] not to encourage you to make pictures.
[7:53] But then I realized that having done
[7:56] that
[7:58] um uh and I was expecting us to just
[8:01] grasp those things because you will find
[8:03] in Deuteronomy where it says uh do not
[8:06] make any graven images. Do not make any
[8:09] idols because when when you when I came
[8:11] to speak to you, you did not see any
[8:13] form of any man or woman or beast or
[8:16] bird or fish or anything. Only you heard
[8:18] a voice. So he asked Israel just listen
[8:21] to the voice. Do not be like the
[8:23] Canaanites and make unto you any graven
[8:25] images.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; And so I thought, well, so when I taught
[8:29] the logos and I taught man and
[8:31] theophony, I just drew like these ovals.
[8:34] You remember these ovals with an oval
[8:37] within an oval and masculine attribute,
[8:39] feminine attribute. But I didn't realize
[8:43] that um generations or time was going to
[8:46] go and some of you would have thought
[8:49] that
[8:50] King Theophony was formless or that
[8:54] theophony itself was formless
[8:57] and that's not what I purely because I
[9:00] don't want you to make an image but now
[9:03] I have to tell you
[9:06] um you have to grasp the truth because
[9:10] there's a reason why God did what he did
[9:13] and became what he did. And the whole
[9:16] thing is it's got to do with man.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; So that's my subject this morning. The
[9:23] story of God and man. There's going to
[9:25] be a lot of pictures. And I'm telling
[9:27] you now, do not take my pictures and
[9:29] make idols.
[9:31] They are pictures for children to
[9:33] understand. and they're they're they're
[9:36] there to make you understand the
[9:38] different concepts that brother Brandon
[9:40] has spoken of. And we're going to talk
[9:42] about king theophony. We're going to
[9:44] talk about logos. We're going to talk
[9:45] about a lot of things. And so the
[9:48] children today probably know more than
[9:50] you um you because of what we did with
[9:53] them in Sunday school. So I'm expecting
[9:55] the children to answer when I ask
[9:57] questions. And then also uh just be
[10:01] careful because these children are going
[10:02] to start drawing all my pictures right
[10:04] here right now. So uh hope you brought
[10:07] enough pages.
[10:09] All right.
[10:11] I want to say this. Any person who
[10:15] thinks he can make up his mind and tell
[10:18] you that he knows exactly what theophony
[10:22] is, looks like, exists as that man is a
[10:26] fool.
[10:29] that man is an absolute total 100% fool.
[10:32] And I've got no issues saying that
[10:34] because no man can know exactly what it
[10:37] is, what it looks like, what it existed
[10:40] like before. There's there's nothing.
[10:42] And if you tell me that you have come up
[10:45] with the truth based on everything
[10:46] brother has said, you're an even bigger
[10:49] fool because then I know you haven't
[10:51] read the message because brother Bam
[10:54] says things from the same message. I'll
[10:56] tell you I'll just tell you this from
[10:58] from the same message you'll hear you'll
[11:01] read all the quotes if you read all the
[11:02] quotes you'll find out there are some
[11:04] people who say the angels were cast down
[11:08] uh before um um man was made and that's
[11:13] how I believe it that's how I see it
[11:15] there from the same message there'll be
[11:17] people will say that Lucifer was only
[11:20] cast down in the garden of Eden when he
[11:22] came to deceive the woman and from the
[11:25] same message of the prophet But you'll
[11:27] hear that Lucifer and them were only
[11:28] cast down after Cain where the angels
[11:31] came down and and became fallen spirits
[11:33] that pressed themselves into man and
[11:34] procreated through human race. From the
[11:36] same message, you'll get three different
[11:38] stories.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; And I don't have a problem with our
[11:42] brothers having different stories. Like
[11:44] I say to you, to me, if it all ends up
[11:47] with the seventh seal, bringing back the
[11:50] mystery of Christ and the bride uniting
[11:52] and bringing back the original purpose
[11:54] of God, I don't care how you got there.
[11:57] But the way I'm getting there is the way
[12:00] God has revealed to me to see it and
[12:02] it's helping me. It's it's doing good
[12:04] for me. It's not leading me on a
[12:05] negative path. And that's all I can
[12:06] preach. I can't preach all the stories.
[12:09] I can only preach the one that's clear
[12:11] to me. Amen.
[12:13] Yeah.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; So, there has always been this amazing
[12:16] question about man through the ages of
[12:19] time. Whenever the subject of God comes
[12:23] into conversation, there's always this
[12:25] one question that pops up that has
[12:27] forever intrigued man. And if it is
[12:29] this, if there is a God in this massive
[12:33] universe, why does he care about man?
[12:36] Why should he invest so much time? We we
[12:38] read all the scriptures where the the
[12:40] the poets and the psalmists were asking
[12:43] the very questions. Poets and psalmists
[12:45] are uh what do they call these guys?
[12:48] Philosophers. Spiritual philosophers.
[12:50] That means there are people who sit
[12:52] there like this,
[12:54] right? Thinking why would God be so
[12:57] mindful of us? Look at us. Look at how
[13:00] great the planets are. Look at how great
[13:01] the stars are. Look at how great the
[13:03] universe is. Why is he so concerned? In
[13:06] today's world, the scientists are say,
[13:07] "You mean to tell me that in in this
[13:09] massive universe, the small speck called
[13:12] earth and the smallest specks called
[13:14] humans, your great god is interested in
[13:16] you?
[13:18] I can't believe that."
[13:21] So if there is a god, why does he care
[13:23] about man? Why should he invest so much
[13:25] time? Why should there be prophecies?
[13:27] What is his interest in man when there
[13:29] are other more obedient submissive
[13:33] creations that he would be more
[13:35] successfully occupied with?
[13:38] Sounds like a good question.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Religions claim that God is so invested
[13:44] in man's existence,
[13:46] but men constantly don't want to be
[13:49] invested in God's existence.
[13:52] They find that a problem. Why? If God is
[13:55] so mindful of me, why am I not so
[13:57] mindful of him?
[14:01] So why does God care about man? The
[14:03] psalmist and prophets ask the question,
[14:06] what is man that God is mindful of him?
[14:08] So let me say this clearly. The
[14:10] revelation of the full word of God in
[14:13] these last days has shown us that there
[14:16] can be no knowledge or teaching or
[14:20] understanding of God without the
[14:23] understanding of man.
[14:27] You cannot understand God without
[14:30] understanding man.
[14:33] That's what the entire message teaches
[14:34] us.
[14:36] That said, I mean to now answer the
[14:39] ultimate question. The ultimate question
[14:42] is who is God?
[14:45] And to answer that question, you have to
[14:47] answer who is man?
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Without man, there is no consciousness
[14:55] of God.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; Because nothing else has a soul.
[15:02] The animals are not conscious of God.
[15:05] They don't get together and worship.
[15:08] They don't read the word. They don't
[15:09] need the word. The animals need no
[15:12] salvation.
[15:14] They live according to the spirit by
[15:16] which he put in them. And they do their
[15:18] purpose without question. They don't
[15:20] even know whether there is another
[15:21] purpose for them.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; There is no other being in the universe
[15:27] that has a soul.
[15:29] Yeah,
[15:29] &gt;&gt; that means if there is no soul, there is
[15:32] no consciousness of God because it is
[15:34] the soul that actually gives
[15:36] consciousness of God.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; It is the soul that you have that
[15:40] actually puts the question, where is
[15:42] God?
[15:44] &gt;&gt; What does my life mean? Is there more to
[15:47] my existence? Why was I born? There's no
[15:50] other creature on the planet that asks
[15:52] that question, that even needs an
[15:54] answer. So to understand God while you
[15:59] are here you have to understand man
[16:02] because the answer to who is God is in
[16:04] the answer to who is man.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; That's why it is the story of God and
[16:09] man.
[16:10] All right children are you ready? So
[16:13] let's begin.
[16:15] We begin from the beginning of the
[16:19] beginning and the beginning of
[16:20] beginnings. Okay, that's where we begin.
[16:25] And there was a beginning, there was
[16:27] another beginning, and there was a
[16:29] beginning of beginnings. That's why I'm
[16:31] saying this. And the reason my title is
[16:34] from eternity through time to eternity
[16:38] &gt;&gt; is the beautiful part of this is time as
[16:41] you understand it was constantly
[16:43] changing.
[16:44] There was a beginning where 24-hour days
[16:47] began, but there was another beginning
[16:49] before 24-hour days began. And there was
[16:52] another beginning before those 24-hour
[16:54] before those days began. So if you if
[16:57] you think time was constant, that's
[16:59] where we make all the mistakes. This is
[17:01] where science fails because time was
[17:04] never constant.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Time is constant now according to what
[17:08] is necessary for us now. But there was a
[17:11] beginning.
[17:13] And then before all beginnings, we find
[17:18] the beginnings of man were in something
[17:20] called the great fountain of life.
[17:24] All right, this is one of those
[17:26] drawings.
[17:28] Brother Baron calls it the fountain of
[17:30] seven colors, right? And man was in that
[17:35] fountain of seven colors,
[17:38] right? And you find I I put in all these
[17:41] little dots there because the prophet
[17:43] tells us in him were all these
[17:45] attributes.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; And he said, so how do we understand
[17:49] attributes? He they're like seeds. A
[17:52] seed has a potential to grow into
[17:54] something. And he said in those
[17:57] attributes were the attribute to be a
[17:59] father, to be a son, to be a mother, to
[18:02] be a wife, to be a to be a savior, to be
[18:05] a redeemer, to be a friend. In there was
[18:08] all these potentials,
[18:10] right? This great fountain is filled
[18:13] with all these kinds of attributes that
[18:16] later and this is before time,
[18:20] right? Later these attributes would
[18:22] become something within time.
[18:27] There were attributes like father, son,
[18:30] holy ghost, savior, healer, redeemer,
[18:34] provider, comforter and many many more.
[18:37] It's eternal attributes. Then we believe
[18:40] something in this attribute that today
[18:43] we call father
[18:46] started some kind of movement within
[18:48] himself.
[18:50] These attributes began to draw together.
[18:54] We call it forming a plan.
[18:59] Now this is me trying to explain this
[19:01] from the understanding of man. Do you do
[19:04] you understand me? It's like you sitting
[19:07] down one day and your thoughts are
[19:11] coming together which all culminate in a
[19:13] plan. What do you see? If if any one of
[19:16] you is normal, you have red blood and
[19:19] gray cells upstairs.
[19:21] You all think the same.
[19:24] Which means from from your mind from all
[19:27] the things that you draw from around you
[19:30] thoughts inside your head begin to form
[19:33] and eventually what you thinking about
[19:36] forms a picture in your mind that you
[19:39] can see.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; And from for that picture you actually
[19:43] see a process by which you can bring
[19:46] that picture to pass.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; That's how we understand it. We're
[19:50] trying to tell you it might have
[19:52] happened that way with him. Means all
[19:55] those attributes began to draw together
[19:58] and began to form into a plan, right?
[20:02] And uh we we now know we're we're kind
[20:06] of calling him the father because the
[20:08] father is the one with all the
[20:10] attributes. Father is the one that
[20:12] produces seed. But yet at that moment
[20:17] or whatever it was, there was no time.
[20:20] It was eternal.
[20:21] At that time, at that moment,
[20:25] um he was not known as the father.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; There was nothing to know him as
[20:30] anything.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even him.
[20:36] &gt;&gt; He wasn't even God.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Because there was nothing to worship
[20:41] him.
[20:43] Now this section of attributes that's
[20:45] that's coming together, it's beginning
[20:46] to come together by his own will
[20:50] by the will of the great fountain of
[20:52] attributes. They begin to become a
[20:55] dimension of his existence. He's
[20:59] actually forming himself into a new
[21:01] existence
[21:02] and that existence is going to be called
[21:04] the seventh dimension by us aons later.
[21:09] the dimension of the word, right? And uh
[21:13] the seventh dimension which started
[21:16] uh as we know now becoming visible to
[21:20] the celestial eye
[21:22] even that we don't understand yet.
[21:27] Right? And the purpose of this
[21:29] collection of attributes and the way
[21:31] they're forming, the way they're coming
[21:33] together in this dimension was solely to
[21:36] reveal or manifest all of these
[21:39] attributes. He desired for all these
[21:42] potentials to become reality
[21:45] and to be appreciated by something.
[21:51] Amen.
[21:53] and this dimension solely revealing or
[21:56] manifesting this this great fountain of
[21:58] natures and yet he's still not God
[22:03] &gt;&gt; because there's still nothing to worship
[22:05] him. So this section or group of
[22:09] attributes was what we came to call and
[22:14] who became known as the word.
[22:17] Amen. We also know it was the lamb's
[22:20] book of life and um uh everything that
[22:24] that could make that being be revealed
[22:28] as God in time was contained in this one
[22:33] holy section. So you have this book of
[22:36] life and there can be many attributes
[22:37] that relate to many other things but in
[22:39] him there was a section a section of
[22:43] eternal life the lamb section of the
[22:45] book and there were specific attributes
[22:48] in there that are related to a specific
[22:51] manifestation in the future from that
[22:53] point. So can you see that nobody can
[22:57] claim to know the great fountain of
[22:59] life, the great fountain of seven
[23:01] colors. You cannot worship that. You
[23:04] don't know that. That's never been
[23:06] revealed to you.
[23:09] Nobody can claim to understand that
[23:11] existence. I tried my best. I did I
[23:14] think I did well for a colorblind person
[23:16] cuz I'm I try to make some kind of
[23:18] amber. You can you can't imagine what it
[23:21] was like. It was painful. Took me a
[23:22] whole week to do all these drawings.
[23:26] uh but the only thing we can come to
[23:27] know and claim to know is the collection
[23:29] of attributes and we call him the word
[23:33] the logos and that's our next picture
[23:37] because from him is going to come the
[23:40] word right let's go to the quote in the
[23:44] beginning we'll go back to our Hebrew
[23:45] teaching just for a few minutes God was
[23:47] this great big fountain of seven colors
[23:51] how many knows that see and how many
[23:53] knows that God has seven spirits.
[23:55] Absolutely. Seven spirits and there were
[23:57] seven eyes in the land and so forth.
[23:59] Obviously those are symbols, right? And
[24:02] that all come together now. Now that was
[24:05] God. Are you ready for this? Now the
[24:07] logos,
[24:09] he went out of God. He means he went out
[24:11] of the fountain of seven colors
[24:14] which was God
[24:16] coming from this one big fountain into a
[24:20] body in the body of a man.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; Man hasn't been created yet. So what
[24:28] does it mean? The logos came into the
[24:31] body of a man. Means there's more to man
[24:34] than you understand.
[24:37] &gt;&gt; This is not even man. Yeah. Yeah.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; And it made the logos which we call
[24:44] theophony.
[24:46] So here's my picture.
[24:50] All right. I have no idea what I did
[24:52] there. Okay. I I I just put the cloud
[24:58] around his head so you understand
[25:01] what comes back in the end time. But
[25:03] prior to this, when I drew these
[25:05] pictures, I left out the body that looks
[25:07] like man. But I want you to know there
[25:10] are plenty of quotes in the message
[25:12] where brother Brandon said, "Out of the
[25:14] fountain of seven colors, he became
[25:18] in the form of man."
[25:21] He gave himself the form of man
[25:25] who was going to come way in the future.
[25:29] All right, let's explain that. Right. So
[25:31] the coming together of these selective
[25:33] attributes caused these all these
[25:35] attributes to develop into an amazing
[25:37] ability that create that would create
[25:39] dimensions and worlds. So from this
[25:43] existence so he's leaving that existence
[25:45] he's leaving that existence of not being
[25:47] known, not being seen, not being
[25:49] understood. He's leaving that existence
[25:52] of random potentials and they all are
[25:56] becoming one in a person in a visible
[25:59] person.
[26:01] A person visible in a celestial
[26:03] dimension
[26:05] &gt;&gt; and that one is called the word and in
[26:08] the beginning was the word.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; Right? Now for our understanding and our
[26:13] purposes we call him the word in because
[26:16] it said so in the Bible in him was the
[26:19] attribute. So all those attributes there
[26:22] came into him. They're all all of it
[26:26] becoming him. In him are the same
[26:29] attributes that were before that.
[26:32] In King Theophony,
[26:34] in the Logos was the attribute still
[26:37] there to be father, to be God, to be
[26:39] healer, to be savior, to be everything
[26:42] that would be manifested in time.
[26:44] Whatever was there in that which uh the
[26:47] self-existing one is now coming into the
[26:51] form of a being that he made for
[26:54] himself. It was God giving birth to
[26:56] himself. Amen.
[26:59] &gt;&gt; God bringing himself to become another
[27:02] existence. For what reason?
[27:05] Because in his mind, the picture that he
[27:08] saw was man.
[27:11] So he made himself into a form that
[27:14] would relate to
[27:18] what was going to be. Can you imagine if
[27:22] he created himself like an octopus?
[27:25] I'm saying what would be the point? What
[27:28] what if it took a form like a cloud?
[27:31] What would be the point? How is that
[27:33] relatable to man? He didn't create man
[27:37] in the image or he didn't create this
[27:40] here uh in the image of God.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; This is not in the image of God. But he
[27:45] created his own body in the image of us
[27:48] &gt;&gt; or in the form that we would be. He gave
[27:51] himself I don't know gave himself a
[27:53] head, arms, legs, torso.
[27:57] I'm only telling you what the prophet
[27:58] said,
[28:00] &gt;&gt; right?
[28:02] The reason why we don't make him an idol
[28:04] because if you read all the books, all
[28:06] the Christian child book, child, what do
[28:10] you call it? Sunday school books you
[28:12] they make him look like this old man,
[28:14] you know, beard, this massive giant
[28:18] sitting in a chair with his arms like
[28:20] this and all the angels falling down.
[28:22] That's not this.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; That's false. That's somewhere coming
[28:28] close to the truth. That's making him an
[28:30] idol.
[28:31] This is complete mystery. We don't know
[28:35] what's its substance.
[28:37] Uh I cannot tell you. Does it have a
[28:39] heartbeat?
[28:40] Does it have blood? I don't believe so
[28:43] because that's of earth.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; What is that? We're yet to find out
[28:48] because when we are raptured, we'll
[28:49] know.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Right now, nobody's going to be able to
[28:52] tell you.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. And in him, our capabilities and
[28:59] and powers that is beyond our
[29:02] understanding. And listen, it's not
[29:04] superhero powers. That's another thing
[29:07] created in the the fictional minds of
[29:09] men. Okay.
[29:12] Uh I think there's another quote
[29:13] question and answers.
[29:16] Okay. Before we go there, let's read
[29:17] this.
[29:19] So John 1:1 is where we took it. In the
[29:21] beginning was the word and the word was
[29:22] with God and the word was God and the
[29:25] same was in the beginning with God and
[29:27] all things were made by him and without
[29:29] him was not anything made that was made.
[29:31] So it wasn't even the fountain of seven
[29:33] colors that began creation. It was that
[29:36] logos, the one who became visible. He is
[29:39] the one that starts creating. Right? So
[29:43] this logos went out of God became into
[29:45] the body into a body form of a man. So
[29:49] God can see into um in the future his
[29:53] plan was to create man for his
[29:55] attributes to be manifested through. So
[29:58] he is in his mind he has already seen
[30:01] he's bringing his final creation and
[30:04] that creation is going to be called man.
[30:06] He has seen it. Now for him to
[30:09] communicate to be relatable he forms
[30:12] himself into a form that would be
[30:14] relatable
[30:16] and that would somehow have a an
[30:19] intimate relationship.
[30:21] Right? Because there's more to this
[30:23] plan. He wants to live in the final
[30:27] creation.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; He wants to be the final creation.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; That's his plan. That was revealed under
[30:34] the seventh seal. That's the part that
[30:37] nobody wants to accept.
[30:41] Because as long as you have religion,
[30:44] religion means God is there. I am here.
[30:46] He's greater. He's the greatest. I am
[30:49] this poor rotten rat that has to go to
[30:52] religions and church and bow myself down
[30:55] and give sacrifices. That's where
[30:57] religion stops. That wasn't his plan at
[31:00] all. His plan was to be you.
[31:06] &gt;&gt; And why is this problematic? Because our
[31:09] definition of God is that God is someone
[31:12] who wants to be idolized.
[31:16] Our definition is that God loves to sit
[31:18] there with his arms crossed while we all
[31:20] sing songs and offer prayers.
[31:24] That is not even close to what God is.
[31:26] That's actually what man is. Fallen man.
[31:31] Fallen man loves praise.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Fallen man loves to be exalted. God
[31:37] doesn't care to be exalted.
[31:40] But if you know him, you will exalt him.
[31:43] But he's not even forcing you to. He's
[31:45] not even trying to do things to make
[31:46] himself more attractive than other
[31:48] things in this world. There's no
[31:50] carnality in worship of God. True
[31:54] worship of God, there's no carnality.
[31:57] Therefore, there's no reason for us to
[31:59] paint pictures of him and make him look
[32:01] more powerful than something else or
[32:03] more beautiful than something else. He
[32:05] doesn't care to look like that.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; He doesn't care to be like that, to be
[32:09] what your imagination comes up with. His
[32:12] original desire was to be you.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; For every one of those attributes to
[32:18] exist in you.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; And so this logos
[32:25] then began to create all the worlds. And
[32:29] there's my next picture of it.
[32:32] We begin with the next beginning.
[32:35] The other beginning was John 1:1. the
[32:38] next beginning. In the beginning, God
[32:40] created the heaven and the earth. So
[32:43] from this logos, it's so beautiful. He
[32:46] then began to speak things into
[32:48] existence. And the prophet said like
[32:50] there was so this is what science calls
[32:52] the big bang
[32:54] this massive amount of energy saying let
[32:58] there be. And the prophet said he took
[33:00] like a there's a this massive energy of
[33:03] light. He took a clinker like a chunk
[33:05] and he threw it into time, let it go
[33:08] through space and said stop. And there
[33:11] was a galaxy and break that up and out
[33:13] of that comes other clinkers and from
[33:15] their planets and then he takes another
[33:17] one and lets it go. He describes it as
[33:20] he was like a like a son playing before
[33:22] the father's doorstep
[33:24] just letting things go and say stop and
[33:26] let it be and stop and let it be and
[33:28] stop and let it be. And there was matter
[33:31] and there was light and there was all
[33:33] kinds of things. And he he would create
[33:36] even darkness so that light could be
[33:39] appreciated.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Matter and all kinds of things and water
[33:44] molecules, atoms were being formed and
[33:47] molecules were being were coming
[33:48] together and gases and liquids and all
[33:51] kinds of things just letting it go. We
[33:54] don't know how long that took.
[33:57] Amen.
[33:59] Genesis 1:1. Now, while this is going
[34:02] on, remember his plan is man.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he made himself in that form.
[34:09] But now, there's another part of his
[34:10] plan because there's still nothing to
[34:12] worship him. And worship him does not
[34:16] mean uh bow down, sing songs, and make a
[34:20] choir like they think the angels are,
[34:22] you know, in heaven. No, that's not it
[34:25] at all. He is now about to do something
[34:28] more. So, he creates angels,
[34:32] right? It was in him to be a man. That's
[34:36] the reason Christ was the expressed
[34:38] image. Now, he was to be father. He was
[34:42] to be son. He was to be savior. He was
[34:46] to be healer. There was nothing that
[34:48] wasn't even an angel or nothing. Then he
[34:52] created angels.
[34:54] Then he become God. He was worshiped.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Right? Then these are the manifestations
[35:01] of his thinking.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; So his thoughts, his attributes, what
[35:05] was in his thoughts and he produced the
[35:07] angels. So here's my rendition of that.
[35:12] Simultaneously
[35:13] while he's creating the worlds, he
[35:17] brings forth the angels. This is what is
[35:20] amazing to me is angels also seem to be
[35:25] in the form of man.
[35:28] And to me this is right because they
[35:30] were made when we say worship God we
[35:33] mean to do his will.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; That's what worship is to subject your
[35:39] will to his will. That's true worship.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Worship is not church.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Worship is to do his will to
[35:49] recognize his authority and bring
[35:52] yourself under subjection. That is
[35:54] worship. If you come to me and say
[35:57] good evening my worship.
[36:00] That means you're telling me you are
[36:02] recognizing my authority and you are
[36:04] willing to do my will. That is worship.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; So now the angels were there to worship
[36:09] him. All right. I have no idea what they
[36:11] look like. There's many quotes. Let me
[36:14] tell you, I've read the message. Brother
[36:16] Ram even says things. There's never been
[36:18] mentioned a female angel.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; I believe that there's never been, as
[36:23] far as we know, they were sexless.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; And more like, but they all resembled
[36:29] the form of man.
[36:32] They were meant to be relatable to man
[36:35] because God was going to send them as
[36:37] messengers to us in time
[36:41] &gt;&gt; to appear in different forms. That's
[36:43] what the purpose of angels were. And he
[36:46] began to reveal his purpose to them. I
[36:48] believe this must have been an amazing
[36:49] time because now for the first time,
[36:52] he's sharing his plan with them. He's
[36:56] probably telling them, I am going to
[36:57] create man. Maybe it's not exactly what
[37:02] you think about right now, but it's
[37:04] going to come to pass. I'm going to
[37:05] create this place, this earth, this
[37:08] Eden, this uh creation, this this uh
[37:11] existence, and there's going to be this
[37:13] form, this body called man, and I'm
[37:16] going to dwell in them, and you are
[37:18] going to be my messengers to them over
[37:20] time. He's explaining, he's he's
[37:22] revealing the word to them.
[37:26] Angels were given a soul. They have this
[37:31] horrible thing called free will that
[37:32] caused all the trouble.
[37:35] And like I said to you last week, this
[37:37] is what it means to be God. This is
[37:40] truly what it means to be God. To be
[37:42] able to give your creation free will,
[37:46] the ability to choose is true worship.
[37:49] Like somebody like a a you know, a man
[37:55] who loves his reflection so much. He
[37:58] thinks he's God's gift to men, to women.
[38:02] Uh, and he thinks he's beautiful. He
[38:05] takes care of his hair and his muscles
[38:07] and his clothes. And he smells better
[38:09] than any woman on the planet.
[38:12] And he uses every single
[38:16] bit of energy and intellect and smarts
[38:18] that he has to force a woman to love
[38:21] him. That's a narcissist.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; That is not God.
[38:28] Because a real man would allow her free
[38:32] will.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; To choose to love him as she pleases,
[38:38] to get to know him, to be honest with
[38:41] her, to tell her his true thoughts about
[38:44] things, to not lie to her. That is what
[38:48] God really is. He's not a narcissist.
[38:51] He's not putting a shroud in front of
[38:54] you or a some kind of fake thing to make
[38:57] you love him while he's something else.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; To be God is to allow his creation free
[39:04] will.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; To choose and knowing that they might
[39:09] reject him.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Remember last week I asked you if you
[39:13] could do that.
[39:15] Every one of us will fail because at
[39:18] some point or the other we'll do what we
[39:20] you know we come up with all these our
[39:21] own word that we come up with is I put
[39:24] my foot down
[39:27] that was the end this is it can you
[39:29] imagine if God had to keep putting his
[39:31] foot down
[39:33] &gt;&gt; with us
[39:35] &gt;&gt; he gives us free will right so the
[39:38] angels were given free will now what
[39:41] happens is having heard all the plan
[39:44] that's going to happened. The angels I
[39:46] believe had some kind of civilization
[39:49] because the celestial dimension I
[39:51] believe my drawing is really bad. I
[39:55] believe
[39:57] it it was something else beyond our
[39:59] understanding. I believe there was a
[40:00] civilization. I believe there was a
[40:02] life. I'm not sure what they lived in. I
[40:05] what was there a realm? Was there a
[40:06] planet? Was there some kind of land? Was
[40:10] it somewhere on Earth? I don't know. But
[40:12] I'm saying they had life.
[40:15] &gt;&gt; They gathered together. They spoke
[40:17] together. They would have sat together.
[40:18] They would have fellowship together.
[40:20] They had conversations. They could have
[40:22] been building things. I don't know. But
[40:25] they had some kind of civilization. They
[40:27] were not these these spirits with wings
[40:29] floating in space just waiting for God
[40:32] to appear somewhere and then they all
[40:34] just bow down and start breaking out
[40:36] into song.
[40:38] That's ridiculous. That's like Greek
[40:40] mythology. there was some kind of
[40:42] civilization and they had free will
[40:44] which means they were able to do things
[40:46] with what God had placed within their
[40:48] realm.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; And so my next drawing,
[40:57] Lucifer, that handsome looking guy in
[40:58] the middle,
[41:01] right? So these are drawings I did with
[41:03] the with the Sunday school. Okay, just
[41:06] so they know. Of course I I made him. So
[41:09] there was no sin in heaven in the sixth
[41:13] dimension like there is sin on earth.
[41:16] Okay? And the original sin was deviating
[41:20] from the original purpose. The original
[41:24] sin in heaven was not evil like we know
[41:27] evil here on earth. There was no murder.
[41:31] There was no killing. There was no
[41:32] adultery. There was no stealing. There
[41:34] was no thieving. There was no Sabbath to
[41:36] to uh desecrate.
[41:39] There was none of those things. The sin,
[41:41] the bad thing Lucifer did was choosing
[41:47] to do his will over God's will.
[41:51] &gt;&gt; That's evil.
[41:53] So what? Let's define evil. What is
[41:56] evil? Is trying to do God a service
[42:00] without it being his will.
[42:03] Lucifer was not trying to be God. He was
[42:07] not trying to produce some other kind of
[42:10] civilization or it eventually would have
[42:12] culminated in that. But he was not
[42:14] trying to anger God. He actually thought
[42:17] he could please God better by doing
[42:21] things his way.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; That was evil.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; It's like Judas. Judas didn't go to to
[42:32] uh to betray Jesus Christ because he
[42:36] believed because he loved money more. He
[42:40] was not interested in the money. We know
[42:42] that because of what happened to him in
[42:43] the end. He and the disciples felt that
[42:47] Christ was hiding himself away and not
[42:49] revealing himself to the public. He
[42:51] thought in his mind, if I could get him
[42:53] to be arrested and let them do what they
[42:57] want, he'll surely save himself and show
[42:58] them who he really is. He believed he
[43:01] was doing something for Christ to help
[43:02] the cause of Christ.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; He didn't know, he didn't think, he
[43:06] didn't realize that the cause of Christ
[43:09] was to die.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; That's why when they took him and they
[43:14] scourged him and he saw what they were
[43:15] doing to Christ, he couldn't take it his
[43:17] mind, what have I done?
[43:20] They are hurting innocent blood and I am
[43:23] the cause of it and took his own life.
[43:26] In the same way Lucifer and we see this
[43:28] throughout. The reason we know it is
[43:31] because this is always the downfall of
[43:33] man. God gives us his will and we think
[43:36] we can do his will our own way. That's
[43:39] evil.
[43:41] &gt;&gt; That's the original sin. The story of
[43:43] Lucifer is really overexaggerated and
[43:46] romanticized in all religious books. He
[43:49] was not trying to physically be above
[43:52] King Theophony.
[43:54] He loved him.
[43:58] He was not trying to be a rock star in
[44:00] heaven. He simply thought he could do
[44:02] God's will his own way. He was trying to
[44:04] do better in God's eyes. There was
[44:07] something rising up. Like brother Pam
[44:09] says, this is what I mean. If you read
[44:11] the whole message, you're going to come
[44:12] up with different If you only choose
[44:13] certain quotes, you'll come up with
[44:15] another story. Like he says, he was
[44:16] jealous of Michael. He wanted to make a
[44:18] greater kingdom in the kingdom of the
[44:20] north. You've got to take those thoughts
[44:22] and look and and ponder and meditate
[44:25] deeply in them to understand that
[44:27] because immediately it makes look like
[44:29] this this Hollywood star. You know, I
[44:32] want to be greater. I want to be but
[44:34] they're angels. They have a soul. Their
[44:36] desire is to serve God. The desire is to
[44:38] please God. How do we know what the
[44:40] right story is? Because we see what
[44:42] happens to us.
[44:47] All that translates to being above God
[44:49] eventually, right? He was trying to be
[44:52] better in God's eyes. He was not
[44:55] satisfied with simply doing what God
[44:57] said. He wanted to make things better.
[45:01] He believed things could work a
[45:04] different way,
[45:06] right? So, I suppose that it could have
[45:09] been along the lines of King Theophony
[45:12] revealing his plan to all of them and
[45:15] his purpose for the angels. It's
[45:19] here's me speculating and I could be way
[45:21] off the mark. He could have seen, but
[45:24] Lord, you have us.
[45:28] You could live through us. Why do you
[45:30] have to wait for man?
[45:33] Why not? We love you. We have free will.
[45:37] We are choosing to worship you. And you
[45:40] could be us.
[45:42] We could be the ones who dwell on earth.
[45:45] We could be the inhabitants. You could
[45:47] produce your But God's plan was man.
[45:51] And there was a an order for the angels
[45:54] to follow. And perhaps that was it. That
[45:57] got to his heart that he believed he
[46:00] could be more than man.
[46:03] I'm just saying I cannot say that
[46:05] Lucifer was upset or angry or jealous
[46:08] because those would be human emotions.
[46:12] I I don't know if angels
[46:15] have exactly the same emotions. Whether
[46:19] maybe they they do because they have
[46:21] free will, they have some kind of
[46:22] emotions. But in celestial dimensions,
[46:25] is the jealousy the same? Is the anger
[46:27] the same? Are they upset? Are they
[46:29] erratic? I don't know.
[46:31] in the message that day on Calvary
[46:35] and sin did not start on earth. Sin
[46:37] started in heaven. Lucifer the devil was
[46:40] condemned creature for his disobedience
[46:42] before he ever struck the earth. What do
[46:44] we get in that? Lucifer was in heaven.
[46:48] His free will led to disobedience in
[46:51] that one statement. And then he struck
[46:53] the earth. So we kind of know what
[46:56] happens, right? He came to earth.
[46:59] Sin began in heaven where God put the
[47:02] angels. Are you listening? This is where
[47:04] I understand that they had free will. He
[47:07] put the angels and so forth upon the
[47:10] same basis that he put human beings on.
[47:15] Knowledge, the tree of knowledge, the
[47:17] tree of life, the tree of knowledge,
[47:19] where man could take his choice. How did
[47:22] I come to it? the understanding that the
[47:24] two trees were all about free will about
[47:27] God's will and man's God's will and free
[47:30] will because he says that here he put
[47:33] the angels on the same basis
[47:39] and when Lucifer was given the
[47:41] preeminences to make his choice he
[47:44] wanted something better than God had
[47:47] that started the trouble there it is if
[47:51] you know these things you will know this
[47:53] is going to constantly happen whenever
[47:55] God reveals his word.
[47:59] All right? So, what this does is starts
[48:02] off war in heaven.
[48:07] All right?
[48:09] Sunday school kids know what I'm what
[48:10] I'm talking about. So, there's a
[48:12] handsome fellow there on the left again.
[48:14] He's got a better hairstyle.
[48:17] Uh, but that's Lucifer. And on this side
[48:20] we have Michael and the archangels or
[48:22] Michael and the angels sorry. And they
[48:26] want to do God's will. They don't want
[48:28] to deviate. Now what has happened is the
[48:31] prophet says in the message that Lucifer
[48:35] deceived 2/3
[48:37] of the angels. Now I know some of you
[48:41] will will say it's conflicting. Yes, it
[48:42] might be. I I really don't know. I I
[48:44] don't care how many thirds they were uh
[48:47] really because I know in the Bible uh it
[48:50] says and the dragon with with his tail
[48:52] took one/ird of the stars and caused
[48:54] them. Yes, you could say I'm just
[48:55] telling you what the prophet said. He
[48:56] said 2/3 of them were deceived. He was
[48:59] trying to say this is why the majority
[49:02] of people on earth are being deceived.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; So there was this war in heaven. Let's
[49:09] read Revelations 12:8. And there was war
[49:12] in heaven. Michael and his angels fought
[49:15] against the dragon.
[49:18] Young children, there's no dragons in
[49:21] heaven.
[49:23] There's no Chinese dragons.
[49:26] There's no African dragons. There's no
[49:28] European dragons or American dragons.
[49:31] Dragons don't exist. They are not flying
[49:34] snakes. In the book of revelation,
[49:37] dragon is a symbol which speaks of a
[49:41] creature that has supreme intelligence,
[49:43] that has supreme understanding, that is
[49:45] very powerful, right? So it's like your
[49:49] mother could be a dragon,
[49:53] right?
[49:55] Or your father, I don't know.
[49:58] And the dragon fought and his angels and
[50:01] prevailed not. Neither was their place
[50:04] found anymore in heaven. That means in
[50:07] that existence, that life, there was no
[50:11] more place for Lucifer and his angels.
[50:14] They could not exist there anymore
[50:16] because whatever they believed in could
[50:19] not exist in that realm.
[50:24] So, what we have is Lucifer and his
[50:26] angels cast out. All right, let's go to
[50:29] the next one. Okay, so this is me trying
[50:34] to make they're now being cast down to
[50:36] earth. We we already know he said
[50:38] they're losing their celestial state and
[50:41] they're cast down to an earthly state,
[50:45] &gt;&gt; which already tells us Earth existed.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[50:50] &gt;&gt; they were the first inhabitants of
[50:51] Earth.
[50:52] Let's read Revelations 12:9.
[50:56] Or rather, let's let's go back to that
[50:57] picture. I just want to this is just my
[51:00] pictorial understanding. I'm trying to
[51:03] Can you see his legs are still celestial
[51:05] as he's coming through?
[51:07] Okay. I'm just trying to show you that
[51:09] they passed from one existence to
[51:11] another.
[51:13] I don't know what what fleshly bodies
[51:15] they had. It would it would mean
[51:18] something. I would think that they were
[51:20] fleshly bodies. some kind of fleshly
[51:21] bodies. They were the first fleshly
[51:23] bodies to inhabit Earth and they broke
[51:25] God's protocol because God wanted the
[51:28] first fleshly beings on Earth to control
[51:31] the earth to be man. They interrupted
[51:34] that plan. So leaving the celestial
[51:37] dimension, they're now the first
[51:39] inhabitants of Earth. Let's read
[51:41] Revelations 12:9. There's the
[51:43] scriptures. It says, "And the great
[51:44] dragon was cast out, that old serpent
[51:46] called the devil and Satan, which
[51:48] deceiveth the whole world. He was cast
[51:50] out into the earth and his angels were
[51:53] cast out with him. There's another
[51:55] scripture Isaiah 14:12-15.
[51:58] How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[52:00] Lucifer, son of the morning. How art
[52:02] thou cut down to the ground which did
[52:05] weaken the nations. For thou has said in
[52:07] mine heart, I will ascend into heaven. I
[52:09] will exalt my throne above the stars of
[52:11] God. That's the other angels. I will sit
[52:13] upon the mount of the congregation in
[52:14] the sides of the north. I will ascend
[52:16] above the clouds, the heights of the
[52:18] clouds. I will be like the most high.
[52:20] It's showing what his intentions were
[52:22] inside, what they culminated into. Yet,
[52:25] thou shalt be brought down to hell. So,
[52:27] in the scripture, we see not just earth,
[52:30] but God could see eventually they will
[52:32] be the inhabitants of hell. Hell wasn't
[52:35] even created yet.
[52:38] So yes, I know if you're a Bible reader,
[52:40] you know that Isaiah 14:12-15 is a
[52:43] parable where Isaiah is speaking to a
[52:46] king, but he's using the parable of what
[52:48] happened to Lucifer to tell the king,
[52:51] you are going to suffer the same fate.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel 28:13-17, it gets even better.
[52:59] Speaking another parable, Ezekiel
[53:01] speaking to another king and saying to
[53:02] him, "Thou was in Eden." Thou has been
[53:06] in Eden. in the garden of God. He
[53:08] obviously that king on earth was not in
[53:10] Eden. So who's he talking about? Right?
[53:12] You were in Eden, the garden of God.
[53:14] Every precious stone was thy covering.
[53:17] The Sardius, the topaz, the diamond, the
[53:19] barrel, the onyx, the jasper, the
[53:20] sapphire, the emerald, the carbuncle,
[53:22] and gold. He's trying to tell this king,
[53:25] you are like Lucifer. You were
[53:27] beautiful. You were blessed.
[53:32] Right? Anna, the workmanship of thy tabs
[53:35] and thy pipes was prepared in thee in
[53:37] the day that thou was created. She's
[53:40] telling him, you were created, and when
[53:42] you were created, you had splendor. You
[53:45] had radiance. You were angelic. You were
[53:48] what men look at and desire.
[53:52] Thou art the anointed cherub that
[53:55] coverth. This is where the thoughts in
[53:57] the Hebrews thought that Lucifer was one
[53:59] of the two cherubams over the ark of the
[54:01] testimony. the anointed cherub that
[54:03] coverth, the one that covers his eyes
[54:05] and with one one wing covers the the
[54:08] holy um the the mercy seat. And they
[54:10] believed the one was Lucifer and the
[54:12] other one on the opposing side was
[54:14] Michael. This is the Jews coming up with
[54:16] their um I don't know whether you can
[54:19] call it folklore, whether it was true. I
[54:20] I don't know. Right? And uh the anointed
[54:24] shepherd covered and I have set thee so
[54:26] thou was upon the holy mountain of God.
[54:28] That means you are part of God's
[54:29] kingdom. You were part of his economy
[54:32] and you walked up and down in the midst
[54:34] of the stones of fire means you were you
[54:37] were filled with holiness. That is
[54:39] holiness unto God. You had God's
[54:41] purpose. The mountain of God is his
[54:44] temple.
[54:47] Verse 15, thou was perfect in thy ways
[54:50] from the day that thou was created. You
[54:52] were perfect. What is perfect? Complete.
[54:54] You had everything.
[54:56] There was no need to desire anything
[54:57] else. There was no desire to be anything
[54:59] else. There was no want for anything
[55:01] else, but somehow you found something to
[55:03] want,
[55:05] right? Till iniquity. You were perfect
[55:08] in the days that you were created. Till
[55:10] iniquity was found in you.
[55:13] Verse 16, by the multitude of thy
[55:15] merchandise, they have filled the midst
[55:16] of thee with violence. Thou was sinned.
[55:18] Therefore, I will cast thee as profane
[55:21] out of the mountain of God. It's telling
[55:22] you, I will cast you out of this
[55:25] dimension. I will cast you out of my
[55:27] servers. You will no longer be a
[55:30] messenger to man. You will no longer be
[55:32] a part of the purpose I made you for.
[55:35] Your purpose is changing. And they have
[55:37] filled the midst of thee with violence
[55:39] or sin. Therefore, I will cast thee out.
[55:41] I will destroy thee, oh covering cherub,
[55:43] from the midst of the stones of fire.
[55:45] Verse 17. Thine heart was lifted up
[55:47] because of thy beauty. Thou was
[55:49] corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy
[55:51] brightness. I will cast thee to the
[55:53] ground. I will lay thee before the kings
[55:55] that they may behold. So there are all
[55:58] your scriptures in the Bible, the
[55:59] references that tell you cast out of one
[56:02] place to the ground, cast out of one
[56:03] place to to earth, cast out of heaven to
[56:06] earth. Got it? That's as much as we
[56:09] know.
[56:12] Okay, so these angels are on earth 2/3.
[56:18] What's the number? My goodness. I I have
[56:20] no idea. Could have been millions.
[56:24] I don't know how many angels God needed.
[56:26] Could be 100,000,
[56:29] could be 500,000, half a million. I
[56:32] don't know. All we know is they were the
[56:34] first inhabitants of earth. They broke
[56:36] the original plan of God.
[56:39] Are you with me?
[56:41] So, let's read.
[56:43] Um,
[56:45] so this is what happened. This is the
[56:46] story. On inhabiting Earth, they wrecked
[56:51] it. They destroyed it.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:55] Because again, they're just not
[56:57] satisfied with God's plan. Their nature
[57:01] is now evolving. They've lost their
[57:03] original state. They're now on this this
[57:06] beautiful planet. And there and and when
[57:09] God creates something, it's beautiful.
[57:11] It's perfect. It's complete. And now
[57:13] they wrecked it. They they drove this
[57:16] earth into being without form and void.
[57:18] In the Bible, the word form means order.
[57:23] without form means the earth was not
[57:25] even a part of a galaxy. It was not
[57:28] revolving around anything. It had no
[57:30] orbit. It was hurtling through space in
[57:34] every direction crashing into things and
[57:36] it was just it had no galaxy. It was it
[57:39] was whatever they did they caused this
[57:42] beautiful planet which they knew was in
[57:44] God's original plan. They wrecked it.
[57:47] They destroyed it.
[57:49] Right? So for God and in void form
[57:52] without form that means without order.
[57:55] Void means wilderness empty that means
[57:58] whatever creation there was on earth
[58:00] these guys destroyed it. They killed it.
[58:03] They messed with it.
[58:06] But they learned something while they
[58:08] were there. They learned of the
[58:09] potential of seed. They learned to
[58:12] hybridize creation.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; They learned about biology. They learned
[58:17] about a lot of things while they were on
[58:18] the planet.
[58:20] Let's read that day on Calvary.
[58:23] For Satan had the earth,
[58:26] the very rocks that he once walked up
[58:29] and down on the earth burning
[58:30] brimstones. Lucifer was the son of the
[58:32] morning mean he was the first.
[58:35] He was the first one. And he walked on
[58:38] the earth when it was burning volcanic.
[58:41] The same rocks that had cooled off when
[58:43] Jesus died at Calvary belt out of the
[58:45] earth. the price that was paid and the
[58:47] bondage of Satan was broke in this
[58:49] quote. Now, now you're going to find
[58:50] other places where it says he was cast
[58:53] down to earth and he came and he
[58:55] deceived Eve. That gives you the
[58:57] impression that while Adam and Eve were
[58:58] in the garden of Eden, that's when he
[59:00] was cast down. Then you find another
[59:02] quote where he'll say these fallen
[59:04] angels came in and they were fallen
[59:05] spirits and they affected the man,
[59:07] pressed themselves into them and
[59:09] procreated with and then brother Baron
[59:11] tells us that's not true in another
[59:13] place.
[59:14] But here are these quotes where he says
[59:17] they were the first inhabitants. Satan
[59:20] had the earth. Lucifer walked on the
[59:24] earth when it was burning volcanic.
[59:28] I don't know. They could have done
[59:31] something to cause the volcanoes. They
[59:33] could have caused that destruction to to
[59:36] make the earth come to a place where God
[59:38] now to cleanse it. water filled up and
[59:41] and and and uh and just water covered
[59:43] the whole thing. There was no more
[59:45] atmosphere,
[59:47] you know. Um there's so many beautiful
[59:50] statements in the message and I just
[59:52] know that if you don't focus on the
[59:55] divine purpose of God, you'll miss it.
[59:58] Like go search for it yourself. I don't
[1:00:00] have the time to read all of it. Believe
[1:00:02] me, it's it's immense. Brother man even
[1:00:04] says when he said let there be light, he
[1:00:07] says I believe the sun already existed
[1:00:09] and the moon. He said I believe there
[1:00:12] was this darkness that was covering the
[1:00:14] earth and all he did was remove that.
[1:00:17] That's a quote. Okay, I don't know if I
[1:00:20] have it here but it's in my head right
[1:00:21] now. So I told you.
[1:00:24] So what we have is God needs to stop
[1:00:30] them because he's his plan is to bring
[1:00:32] man. And these fellas certainly cannot
[1:00:36] be the boss of the planet. They cannot
[1:00:39] own anything. They destroy everything.
[1:00:42] So far that's their resume.
[1:00:45] So he creates hell, another dimension
[1:00:49] where he places them into an existence
[1:00:52] where they cannot destroy anything else
[1:00:55] anymore. He he's removing them from a
[1:00:58] bodily celestial body existence, from an
[1:01:01] earthly body existence and he's
[1:01:03] stripping them of a body and making them
[1:01:05] a soul and a spirit to exist as a soul
[1:01:08] and a spirit. So that's our next part is
[1:01:11] hell is created for the devil and his
[1:01:14] angels right in Jude 16 the angels Jude
[1:01:19] is saying and the angels which kept not
[1:01:21] their first estate
[1:01:23] but left their own habitation he has
[1:01:26] reserved in everlasting chains under
[1:01:28] darkness and the judgment of the great
[1:01:31] day. So they lost their first estate.
[1:01:34] They left their original habitation and
[1:01:36] now they are become spirits that are
[1:01:39] stuck in everlasting chains of darkness.
[1:01:43] Right? So here's my rendition of that.
[1:01:47] The next slide, brothers.
[1:01:49] Okay. So kind of like the same. The
[1:01:52] children were very traumatized when I
[1:01:54] when I drew uh the spirits in my house
[1:01:58] for them. So I kind of changed that too.
[1:02:01] Okay. I just want to say I don't know
[1:02:03] what spurts look like, right? I'm just
[1:02:06] trying to show you in in some some kind
[1:02:08] of symbolic. So, please don't go get
[1:02:10] terrified and have nightmares of this.
[1:02:12] This is just like me. I used a black
[1:02:14] background with some white paint and
[1:02:15] then smudged it. Got it? Don't be
[1:02:19] terrified. And they spurs. I mean, what
[1:02:20] can they do?
[1:02:22] I mean, it's not like they can punch
[1:02:23] you.
[1:02:25] So anyway, again, what I'm showing is
[1:02:27] you can see his legs are still flesh,
[1:02:30] but he's leaving one existence and
[1:02:32] moving into another. So what they what's
[1:02:34] happening is they're losing a bodily
[1:02:37] existence and becoming spirits. This is
[1:02:39] why those fallen angels today are
[1:02:42] influencing spirits. That's all they can
[1:02:46] do. They cannot do anything. They need a
[1:02:48] body to work through. The only way they
[1:02:52] can still accomplish what Lucifer wants
[1:02:54] to do is to influence people.
[1:02:57] He's got to use the fourth dimension,
[1:03:00] technology, communication.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; He's got to use people who have
[1:03:05] surrendered their soul to darkness to
[1:03:08] contact them. He's going to use human
[1:03:10] gifts to get through them
[1:03:14] because God put them in these
[1:03:16] everlasting chains of darkness. Meaning
[1:03:19] they're trapped by their situation.
[1:03:23] They're trapped by them having no body.
[1:03:26] Got it? This is why you'll end up having
[1:03:29] in the last day um the son of predition.
[1:03:34] That what is the son of pition? He's a
[1:03:36] man who has surrendered his entire will
[1:03:39] to the fifth dimension and he becomes
[1:03:42] the fifth dimension incarnate.
[1:03:46] But they cannot do anything unless you
[1:03:48] give them your will.
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; That's it. Got it? So then God starts
[1:03:54] refurbishing the earth.
[1:03:56] Lucifer and his angels had done
[1:03:58] something on earth before the
[1:04:00] destruction and they learned quite a
[1:04:01] lot. I want to read some quotes to you
[1:04:03] here that's not there on the slides.
[1:04:04] Just in the beginning, brother Bam says
[1:04:07] in the fourth seal, in the beginning,
[1:04:09] God created heavens and earth. Period.
[1:04:11] See, that's all. In other words, God
[1:04:14] created heavens and the earth. Done. You
[1:04:17] listening.
[1:04:19] The world without form and void. I said,
[1:04:21] I believe. Now, here's brother saying in
[1:04:23] the fourth seal, I believe every seed
[1:04:26] was laying right there from some other
[1:04:29] civilization
[1:04:31] or something and as soon as the water
[1:04:34] lifted off and light struck, trees and
[1:04:36] everything came.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; That's in the fourth seal. I believe the
[1:04:40] seeds, the potential, the things that
[1:04:42] that grew that came to were there from a
[1:04:45] previous civilization or something.
[1:04:48] Just telling you what he said. Paragraph
[1:04:50] 63 in the message, there is a man who
[1:04:52] can turn on the light. It's not there.
[1:04:54] Follow. He says, "But the world, well,
[1:04:56] the earth was without form and void, and
[1:04:58] the water was upon the earth, and God
[1:05:00] said, move upon the water and let there
[1:05:02] be light." Paragraph 64, I told it was
[1:05:04] here somewhere. Now, I believe that the
[1:05:06] sun and so forth was already in
[1:05:07] existence.
[1:05:09] Amen.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; I believe the moon, the sun and the moon
[1:05:12] was already in existence. He says all
[1:05:15] that he did was remove the darkness,
[1:05:17] separate the light from the darkness and
[1:05:19] light and there was light.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; That's what brother's thoughts were when
[1:05:24] God said, "Let there be light."
[1:05:27] And we then know from Genesis 1:3, what
[1:05:30] he starts doing is he starts adjusting
[1:05:32] the light. What's he doing? Because the
[1:05:34] earth was all without form just hurtling
[1:05:37] through space. He reigns it in. He pulls
[1:05:40] it into the solar system,
[1:05:42] puts it into orbit, starts refurbishing.
[1:05:45] He starts with light. Then he separates
[1:05:48] waters from waters, creating an
[1:05:49] atmosphere, takes waters above the
[1:05:51] firmament and waters beneath and and
[1:05:53] makes oceans. He first solves the light
[1:05:56] problem, then the water problem. Then he
[1:05:58] brings the creation in the oceans, and
[1:06:01] then he he brings the grass and the
[1:06:03] plants. He's he's readjusting matter.
[1:06:06] And then he readjusts time. He says,
[1:06:09] "Let the planets and the stars, let them
[1:06:12] be for days and seasons and months and
[1:06:14] years." That's when time adjusted to
[1:06:17] 24-hour days.
[1:06:20] See, a lot of people think we are crazy
[1:06:24] creationists.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; They don't understand what God has
[1:06:27] revealed to us.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; We're not saying God created the whole
[1:06:30] this whole thing in six 24-hour days.
[1:06:33] The Bible doesn't even say that. The
[1:06:35] Bible does not say the earth is 6,000
[1:06:38] years old or 12,000 years old. Man says
[1:06:40] that. Other people who read the Bible
[1:06:42] and claim this is it. This is how it is.
[1:06:44] This is how we learned in Bible school.
[1:06:46] This is what it must be. We don't
[1:06:48] believe that.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; We've got to take what the Bible says,
[1:06:51] what the prophet says, and we see the
[1:06:52] whole creation story.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; We see time being adjusted.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; The third dimension. We've got light,
[1:07:00] matter, and time. Those three
[1:07:01] dimensions. What's he doing by adjusting
[1:07:04] these dimensions? He's bringing the
[1:07:07] conditions for man to finally come to
[1:07:09] earth.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here's what happened. God
[1:07:14] creates man in his own image. Here's
[1:07:18] another rendition which I've never done
[1:07:20] before. Because prior to this, I I don't
[1:07:22] even know if that's right. I'm going to
[1:07:25] tell you why I did that. Okay. Before
[1:07:26] this, I did an oval with another oval
[1:07:29] inside it and said there's theophony.
[1:07:32] But because I showed you king theophony
[1:07:34] was man, he's creating king he's
[1:07:36] creating man. He's taking one attribute
[1:07:39] out of him and said Adam
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; and that became theophony. Now why is
[1:07:45] there a woman there or something that
[1:07:47] looks like a woman? I don't I I don't
[1:07:49] know. I'm telling you in he says in
[1:07:51] Genesis 5:1
[1:07:53] uh that he in the day that he created
[1:07:56] them he made them male and female
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; male and female created he them in
[1:08:00] theophony
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; right now I'm going to be totally honest
[1:08:06] with you and I and I'm going to tell you
[1:08:08] in theophony I have no idea what defines
[1:08:11] male and female
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; because it's not related to gender or
[1:08:14] sex.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; So what is male and female in theophony?
[1:08:18] I have no idea. But in my limited human
[1:08:20] knowledge, I see male and female like
[1:08:23] that. That's why I drew that picture. It
[1:08:26] could be totally wrong. I don't know.
[1:08:27] Okay. So anyway, let's get to the story.
[1:08:30] That's semantics.
[1:08:32] The logos, that great king Theophony,
[1:08:36] he takes an attribute out of the lamb
[1:08:40] section of the book, right?
[1:08:43] uh and and that lamb section of the book
[1:08:45] is the feminine attributes of God. There
[1:08:48] is a masculine part of of of that of
[1:08:51] that group and there's a feminine part
[1:08:53] of the group. So man, all of you there
[1:08:57] are attributes in the feminine
[1:08:59] attributes of God. You come from there
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; because the masculine attributes are
[1:09:05] him. He's going to be father. He's going
[1:09:08] to be healer. He's going to be redeemer.
[1:09:09] He's going to be savior. He's going to
[1:09:11] be all those things. That's the
[1:09:13] masculine. He's going to be the
[1:09:15] headship. He's going to be the capstone.
[1:09:17] You're going to be the bride.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; So, there's a group of attributes that
[1:09:21] makes him the masculine. And there's a
[1:09:24] group of attributes that's going to make
[1:09:25] us the feminine where Shikina can rest
[1:09:28] on us. And all the attributes that man
[1:09:31] is going to come from is from there.
[1:09:35] And he takes one out and he says,
[1:09:36] "Adam." Inside those attributes called
[1:09:39] man were two attributes. Again, they
[1:09:43] were masculine and feminine. So in the
[1:09:46] man himself, he made him in the image of
[1:09:49] himself. So which means within man is
[1:09:52] the same capabilities that was in King
[1:09:55] Theophony.
[1:09:57] In man is also masculine and feminist
[1:10:00] attributes.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; Right? Why? I I told you this before. If
[1:10:06] you look around you and you ask of
[1:10:09] anything in nature,
[1:10:11] anything in nature that expresses God's
[1:10:14] two attributes in harmony. It's power
[1:10:17] beyond our understanding.
[1:10:20] Right? To like I said before, to have
[1:10:22] magnetism, you have to have north and
[1:10:24] south poles.
[1:10:26] To have electricity, you need negative
[1:10:28] and positive charges. To have water
[1:10:31] flowing, you need high pressure and low
[1:10:33] pressure. You unless two attributes are
[1:10:36] in harmony, you have no power.
[1:10:40] That's expressing God.
[1:10:44] So inside the unity of these two
[1:10:47] attributes, these attributes, there's
[1:10:49] human, there's prophet, there's priest,
[1:10:52] there's king, there's Christ, there's
[1:10:53] messiah. In man there are attributes of
[1:10:57] human, prophet, priest, king, Christ.
[1:11:04] There is Emmanuel, God with us. There is
[1:11:07] husband, there is bride, there is wife,
[1:11:10] there's countless more mysterious
[1:11:12] attributes in there that cannot even be
[1:11:15] defined in human words. We don't even
[1:11:17] have the words yet.
[1:11:19] But they were gene seeds of God. And
[1:11:22] that could only be revealed as time went
[1:11:24] on. And if they were placed, if those
[1:11:27] attributes were placed in in human
[1:11:29] vessels, they were going to manifest
[1:11:31] into something. Praise be to God. So,
[1:11:35] however, in this condition on earth,
[1:11:38] they don't have the five senses that we
[1:11:40] possess now. They don't have touch,
[1:11:42] taste, feel, hear like we here. The
[1:11:46] their senses are completely different.
[1:11:47] And I don't know what they are. Was the
[1:11:50] woman's individual celestial body
[1:11:52] created? Probably. I don't know. I think
[1:11:56] so. I I don't know what's the correct
[1:11:58] way to depict this. That's the reason
[1:12:00] why I always depict them as that those
[1:12:03] ovals.
[1:12:04] So those theophies, however, were not
[1:12:07] sexual beings. They were not sensual
[1:12:08] beings. What kind of male and female is
[1:12:11] the male and female of the logos?
[1:12:15] How can you describe can do you think we
[1:12:17] right now can even describe masculine
[1:12:20] and feminine of the logos?
[1:12:23] We we kind of have this
[1:12:26] idea that we can express with the words
[1:12:28] that we have right Christ Jesus savior
[1:12:32] Adonai Lord. We can ascribe all those
[1:12:35] those and the reason we can is because
[1:12:37] it makes sense to us for for us to
[1:12:39] ascribe that to him. And then we when we
[1:12:41] think about us, we think about church,
[1:12:44] the bride, right? That kind of makes
[1:12:47] sense to us. But do you think you can
[1:12:49] accurately describe what masculine and
[1:12:51] feminine is in the word form in
[1:12:54] theophony?
[1:12:56] I certainly don't. But yet, it was the
[1:12:59] word form that had to do with natures.
[1:13:01] What do they look like? Nobody knows.
[1:13:05] So, you've all been warned. Do not make
[1:13:09] an idol of my drawings.
[1:13:12] Right? All I know is in that form they
[1:13:14] cannot till the ground. He says father
[1:13:18] said they could not till the ground but
[1:13:20] they had full power of spoken word. Now
[1:13:23] hold that thought. This is not angels.
[1:13:27] This is man.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; This is original thoughts of God coming
[1:13:31] into existence. This being is not
[1:13:35] remember he said he was made a little
[1:13:36] lower than the angels but you crowned
[1:13:38] him with glory. You gave him the the the
[1:13:41] the authority of earth.
[1:13:44] This
[1:13:46] this guy these people they're not
[1:13:49] messengers.
[1:13:51] Angels are messengers.
[1:13:54] They're not messengers. They are the
[1:13:56] true owners
[1:13:58] of this planet. They're the true owners
[1:14:01] of this existence. And he, the great
[1:14:05] eternal God, was wanting to dwell in
[1:14:07] this existence.
[1:14:10] This was the first part. This wasn't the
[1:14:12] end because he still wanted to extend
[1:14:14] past the offony to flesh. Are you with
[1:14:17] us? But he's got full power. Power of
[1:14:20] spoken word. Unlike the angels. The
[1:14:22] angels were not walking around speaking
[1:14:24] things into existence, moving this here
[1:14:26] and there. They were manipulating life.
[1:14:29] They do not have the capacity to create.
[1:14:32] Man did.
[1:14:35] Hey, wake up.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Your eyes are open and you're sleeping.
[1:14:39] I want you to absorb the difference
[1:14:41] between angels and man. He gave this man
[1:14:45] the authority that he has and free will.
[1:14:53] This man could create, could speak
[1:14:55] things into existence.
[1:14:59] So the first man was made spurt man or
[1:15:02] theophony a word man and they were male
[1:15:04] and female as God was. Are you still
[1:15:06] with me?
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; So the man possessed the same power of
[1:15:10] God to maintain harmony and efficiency
[1:15:13] in all the dimensions of earth and he
[1:15:16] was also this man now is also above or
[1:15:22] the authority of the fifth dimension. In
[1:15:25] other words, the fifth dimension answers
[1:15:27] to him. He doesn't answer to the fifth
[1:15:29] dimension. There's nothing hell can say
[1:15:33] to this man in this condition.
[1:15:36] You got us all right. The first man was
[1:15:39] called Adam.
[1:15:42] Who knows what Adam means?
[1:15:45] Adam means man.
[1:15:49] Adam is the name of our species. It's
[1:15:51] the Hebrew name of our species. It means
[1:15:54] man. This is man in the day that he was
[1:15:57] created. Now, we're not talking about
[1:15:59] the flesh man.
[1:16:01] This is man.
[1:16:04] He's called Adam.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; In the day that he was created, male and
[1:16:08] female created them and he called their
[1:16:10] name Adam.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; So God creates man in his image. Okay,
[1:16:18] our next slide.
[1:16:20] Again, apologies.
[1:16:23] You ask me
[1:16:25] why I made him light colored. I don't
[1:16:28] know. And this is as much as my
[1:16:30] colorblind eyes could do. I really
[1:16:32] struggled to make brown.
[1:16:34] Uh but I made the angels the same color
[1:16:38] and I made uh the devils the same color.
[1:16:41] So
[1:16:43] please don't look at the colors.
[1:16:45] Uh so here's this man. Now we know the
[1:16:49] Bible says when he created him in flesh
[1:16:53] there was only one.
[1:16:55] The woman was not yet created.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Right? So but now this body has the two
[1:17:02] attributes of masculine and feminine
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; inside it. Right? Now we call this body
[1:17:10] an earthly glorified body. It's not born
[1:17:13] of a woman. It's got a connection to the
[1:17:17] theophony
[1:17:19] which means in this existence he has all
[1:17:22] the full power of theophony as a flesh
[1:17:25] man. He can still speak things into
[1:17:28] existence. He can speak things out of
[1:17:30] existence. He has the full power of
[1:17:32] spoken word. The only reason this flesh
[1:17:35] body has that is because he has
[1:17:37] connection to the theophony. How do you
[1:17:40] make connection to the theophony in a
[1:17:43] picture? Brother Alistister, this could
[1:17:44] be all wrong. Yes, it could be all
[1:17:47] wrong. It's just like so I put this
[1:17:49] whole yellow glow around him to show you
[1:17:51] he's connected to his theophony. How it
[1:17:53] actually is, I have no clue. But I
[1:17:57] believe it
[1:17:59] by faith.
[1:18:01] And the reason I believe this is because
[1:18:02] when I come to the end time, I hear
[1:18:04] about the the the the marriage of the
[1:18:09] lamb and the earthly bride. I hear in
[1:18:11] Ephesians about heaven and earth
[1:18:13] embracing. I hear about the marriage of
[1:18:16] the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly
[1:18:17] bride. And I'm seeing my theophony and
[1:18:20] my fleshly body coming together the way
[1:18:23] it should have been. That's full supreme
[1:18:25] power of earth coming to me. I'm seeing
[1:18:27] that. So I understand it that way. I
[1:18:30] understand it from where I am now and
[1:18:32] the revelation open to apply it to that.
[1:18:35] But does it actually look like that? I
[1:18:37] don't know. I'm not even saying that
[1:18:39] Adam was walking around with a glowing
[1:18:41] body.
[1:18:42] Actually, I don't believe it was that.
[1:18:45] I'm just showing you this in diagram
[1:18:47] form. Are you with me?
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; So, we call it an earthly glorified body
[1:18:52] or a glorified fleshly body. Why?
[1:18:55] Because it's an earthly body, not born
[1:18:57] of a woman, spoken into existence,
[1:18:59] connected with the theophony, not born
[1:19:02] of sexual desire. It has no knowledge of
[1:19:04] nakedness because the spirit of man is
[1:19:07] still under the influence of the
[1:19:09] theophony.
[1:19:11] It can speak things into existence
[1:19:12] according to the will of God and yet he
[1:19:16] has free will. Brother man said in this
[1:19:19] form, this is another quote. Even though
[1:19:23] he was made this way, he was perfect in
[1:19:25] all his ways, there was something just
[1:19:28] not right about him because one part of
[1:19:31] him was still in theophony and he said
[1:19:34] that's the woman.
[1:19:36] So God creates the woman from man.
[1:19:38] That's our next one. He takes out the
[1:19:41] female attribute. He creates another
[1:19:43] body. The female attribute comes out of
[1:19:45] him and he puts that in his female body
[1:19:48] and then the masculine part is being
[1:19:50] manifested in the male body. Right?
[1:19:53] That's the best I could do with her.
[1:19:57] Okay,
[1:19:59] you try it, my friend. You try without
[1:20:03] making eyelashes and red lips and other
[1:20:06] You try.
[1:20:08] So anyway, I'm doing this so the Sunday
[1:20:10] school can understand. So there's these
[1:20:13] two. They're now in flesh and they both
[1:20:16] are connected and one in theophony and
[1:20:18] one in flesh,
[1:20:20] right? Perfect harmony. It's a marriage
[1:20:23] covenant.
[1:20:24] And um here's quotes. Brother man said,
[1:20:26] "God dwelt alone with his thoughts. It's
[1:20:28] not there. He'll never do God dwelt once
[1:20:32] only with his thoughts. He'll never do
[1:20:34] that again cuz his thoughts are being
[1:20:36] made manifest. And that's why we are
[1:20:39] right here this day. God fellowshipping
[1:20:42] with his thoughts being made manifest
[1:20:44] and his purpose as father supreme was to
[1:20:47] come was to be one with his family
[1:20:49] earthly family Adam and Eve.
[1:20:53] And the only way that they could be one
[1:20:56] with the family or with God was because
[1:20:58] God's nature was in them.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; God's nature was in them. Are you with
[1:21:06] me?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that made them with God's
[1:21:11] nature in them. Then with each other and
[1:21:13] God they all become one. You can take
[1:21:16] that. You know when I read that quote I
[1:21:18] get lost for hours.
[1:21:21] He wanted to be he's communing with his
[1:21:23] thought. He'll never be that again cuz
[1:21:25] he's already created us. He's dwelling
[1:21:27] with his family. The the two of them
[1:21:29] together in perfect harmony. He in
[1:21:31] harmony with them. They with him they
[1:21:34] become one.
[1:21:35] That's his original plan. He wanted to
[1:21:38] dwell in man. He made man to be God and
[1:21:43] God to be man. That was his desire in
[1:21:46] the beginning. His desire was not to
[1:21:49] have temples and churches.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; The fall created those things.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; So then what what happens is
[1:22:01] we have uh the fall the fall of man.
[1:22:05] Once again, this fall
[1:22:08] took away their theophony. Adam forfeits
[1:22:11] his theophony. I think I have a slide of
[1:22:13] him. And um they had to hide behind the
[1:22:17] bushes.
[1:22:19] This is just to show you that now they
[1:22:21] recognize their nakedness. Okay. And so
[1:22:24] once again, how did they fall? And what
[1:22:26] happens in the fall is they lose
[1:22:28] connection with theophony. Losing
[1:22:30] connection with theophony means losing
[1:22:32] spoken word. Means losing authority of
[1:22:35] the earth means losing power to control
[1:22:39] the fifth dimension. Means losing spoken
[1:22:42] word of creation to bring things into
[1:22:44] existence to take things out of
[1:22:46] existence. They're now left in the image
[1:22:48] of beast.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Right now, hold this thought.
[1:22:54] They were made in the flesh in the image
[1:22:57] of beast. Why? Because man was supposed
[1:22:59] to be relatable to the animals.
[1:23:03] As God made himself, formed himself in
[1:23:05] the image of man so he could be
[1:23:06] relatable to man. Man was created in the
[1:23:09] image of animals. In the form of
[1:23:11] animals. Five fingers like a monkey,
[1:23:14] feet like a bear. Is that right?
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; You remember all those quotes?
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was going to be
[1:23:20] relatable to animals. So he was going to
[1:23:23] be the god of the earth. Okay. So now
[1:23:26] when you remove theophony, when you
[1:23:28] remove the god part from the man, he's
[1:23:32] left as the image of beast. And once
[1:23:34] he's the image of beast, he succumbs to
[1:23:37] the passions of the creature.
[1:23:42] But one important thing,
[1:23:45] what caused this fall? And notice what
[1:23:47] happens. What caused this fall?
[1:23:52] deviating from the original will of God.
[1:23:58] Why? Because Eve didn't go out to be
[1:24:00] evil.
[1:24:02] She was told, she was preached to, she
[1:24:04] was talked to by the the enemy telling
[1:24:06] her, "You can do this another way."
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; What's wrong with do doing it this way?
[1:24:13] I know God had said you shall not eat of
[1:24:15] the tree. That's all symbolism. But you
[1:24:17] can produce children this way. You don't
[1:24:20] have to wait for predestinated sons and
[1:24:23] for you to grow in spiritual maturity to
[1:24:25] speak the first son into existence. Why
[1:24:27] wait that long? You can have your family
[1:24:29] now. You can start procreating. You can
[1:24:31] start bringing sons of God into the
[1:24:32] earth. And look at you. You guys are
[1:24:34] great. You guys are amazing. If you
[1:24:36] produce children, the two of you, you
[1:24:39] know, perfect citizens. You can produce
[1:24:41] children. You'll be great. You'll be
[1:24:42] ruling the earth. This is the sermon she
[1:24:44] was hearing. And she succumbed to that.
[1:24:48] So by her own free will she chose to do
[1:24:53] that and what that caused was mixing of
[1:24:56] natures and corrupting of seed right and
[1:25:00] so the man because she was a part of him
[1:25:04] forfeited his rights
[1:25:06] by his own free will.
[1:25:10] So
[1:25:12] being lost came by your own free will
[1:25:15] and your salvation is going to come by
[1:25:18] your free will again.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; So the only way to bring salvation to
[1:25:24] you is to bring strength of character to
[1:25:27] make you make the right choice in the
[1:25:30] end
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; because it all had to do with choice
[1:25:33] from the beginning. So what happens?
[1:25:36] Just as Lucifer left his first estate
[1:25:40] and was kicked out of that existence,
[1:25:42] man also lost their first estate and is
[1:25:46] kicked out of the garden. It's exactly
[1:25:49] the same scenario taking place again,
[1:25:51] right? And he moves into a lower
[1:25:54] existence.
[1:25:55] So man is left in the image of beast. He
[1:25:58] now has a soul. He's always searching
[1:26:00] for God while in the image of beast.
[1:26:03] still in this condition. Here you are
[1:26:04] sitting in this small little building
[1:26:07] with this group of people. There's
[1:26:09] something inside of you that feels like,
[1:26:11] yeah, you know, I can I can be doing
[1:26:13] something better right now,
[1:26:16] but there's something still keeping you.
[1:26:18] There's something still making you come
[1:26:20] back every week.
[1:26:22] You and of course, I don't know, doing
[1:26:25] something better for you would be like
[1:26:26] going home, having food, and and reading
[1:26:28] your cell phone,
[1:26:31] right? I mean, it's not like you're
[1:26:34] creating new worlds or anything.
[1:26:40] So, I don't know what better you could
[1:26:41] be doing. But anyway, that's how you
[1:26:43] feel. But there's something that's in
[1:26:45] your soul still drawing you back because
[1:26:47] there's something missing. You're still
[1:26:50] asking the question, those people out
[1:26:51] there, I told you the ones who are
[1:26:52] drinking alcohol, taking drugs,
[1:26:54] fornicating, living in in sinful
[1:26:56] attributes coming forth in them. The the
[1:26:59] real problem is they are searching for
[1:27:02] the answer to the question we asked in
[1:27:04] the beginning. Who am I? Who is God? Why
[1:27:07] is he mindful of me? Is there some
[1:27:09] meaning to life?
[1:27:11] And they're finding their temporary
[1:27:14] answers in vices.
[1:27:16] All that it's doing is blocking out the
[1:27:18] m the moments of misery and and pain
[1:27:22] that they feel and the next morning it
[1:27:24] comes back crushing in
[1:27:28] in man the question still remains. So he
[1:27:31] now has to spend his whole life. Now
[1:27:33] what's going to happen people? This is a
[1:27:34] story of God and man.
[1:27:37] What is he going to do for the rest of
[1:27:39] his life? The only way back to God is
[1:27:41] his soul has to seek the word because it
[1:27:45] is the word that made all things. It is
[1:27:48] the word that is God. He has to seek the
[1:27:50] word. The only way in that condition
[1:27:53] that he is going to find the word is in
[1:27:55] spoken word. He cannot find it in
[1:27:57] theophony. cannot find it in sixth
[1:27:59] dimension, seventh dimension. He has to
[1:28:01] find spoken word, which means God has to
[1:28:03] send spoken word.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; You are the only creature on earth that
[1:28:08] responds to spoken word,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; nothing else.
[1:28:13] You know, my wife and I were walking
[1:28:14] yesterday and was telling her, I I'm so
[1:28:17] saddened by this world. I and I I don't
[1:28:21] get bluffed by, you know, all the media.
[1:28:24] I feel like news media, whether they're
[1:28:28] conservative or liberal news media,
[1:28:32] they're all doing humans a disservice.
[1:28:36] You know, all the news is supposed to do
[1:28:38] is tell you this is what this one said.
[1:28:40] That's what this one said. That what
[1:28:41] this one said. Have a good night.
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; This is what happened. This person was
[1:28:46] killed in this crash. This person have a
[1:28:48] good night. They're just supposed to
[1:28:51] report what happened. They're not
[1:28:53] supposed to report what they think those
[1:28:55] people meant.
[1:28:58] We can decide that for ourselves.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; We are supposed to decide that for
[1:29:03] ourselves. They're supposed to tell us
[1:29:04] what each politician did and said.
[1:29:07] They're not supposed to tell us what we
[1:29:09] should think they meant by that.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; That's not news.
[1:29:15] And that's what they're doing. So tell
[1:29:17] me, do you know how many hundreds of
[1:29:20] thousands of millions of stories there
[1:29:22] are in this world worth hearing?
[1:29:25] Like some old guy jumped in the river
[1:29:27] and saved his dog. That should be
[1:29:30] something printed in the news. Nobody
[1:29:31] hears that.
[1:29:33] Why? They've got this cycle of negative
[1:29:36] stuff day in and day out. Do you know
[1:29:39] what that word does to the human soul
[1:29:44] when when you and young people this is
[1:29:45] your we spoke about social media on
[1:29:47] Friday. Can you can you imagine what's
[1:29:50] happening to your mind and your soul if
[1:29:52] all you're hearing on TikTok and YouTube
[1:29:54] is just negativity animosity
[1:29:58] argumentative natures. I'm not fooled by
[1:30:01] either side. They could be conservative
[1:30:03] news, liberal news. They're all nonsense
[1:30:07] because they're all telling us their
[1:30:08] opinion and they're brainwashing us into
[1:30:11] thinking with their side of the story.
[1:30:14] When I listen to it, when I look at it
[1:30:16] and I read it and I said, "Yeah, I know
[1:30:18] all of you guys are trying to make me
[1:30:20] think like you." There's a reason why
[1:30:22] you got a person like
[1:30:25] Greta Tunberg who believes the world is
[1:30:27] ending by climate change because from
[1:30:30] the time she's in primary school, that's
[1:30:31] the negativity she's been fed. She now
[1:30:34] become a celebrity based on false news.
[1:30:38] Can you imagine waking up every day
[1:30:40] living your life like the world is
[1:30:41] ending because of fossil fuels?
[1:30:44] What kind of human is that? What kind of
[1:30:46] god is that?
[1:30:49] What kind of authority of earth is that?
[1:30:54] And you've got whole bunch of people in
[1:30:56] this world just negativity filled with
[1:30:58] negativity. Why am I telling you this?
[1:31:00] Because man is searching for word and
[1:31:02] the enemy is sending him word.
[1:31:07] That word is corrupting his mind and his
[1:31:09] soul. Man responds to word.
[1:31:13] This is why the word of God is salvation
[1:31:16] today.
[1:31:18] This is why young people, you need to
[1:31:20] take his word and hide it in your heart.
[1:31:23] The word of God is the only thing that
[1:31:25] can give you the power to discern good
[1:31:27] and evil. The truth is the only thing
[1:31:30] that can make you know the the truth
[1:31:32] about a person or not.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; You you know if you meet if you see two
[1:31:37] dogs meeting in a park, they don't stand
[1:31:40] around interpreting what the other one
[1:31:43] says. They come you you see them walk
[1:31:46] together and the hair on the back goes
[1:31:47] up like that
[1:31:49] and they look away while they're looking
[1:31:51] at each other. And the two dogs and
[1:31:52] their hands coming together and they're
[1:31:54] sniffing the air. They're smelling the
[1:31:55] pherommones. They're smelling all kinds
[1:31:56] of things. And in like 5 seconds they
[1:31:59] know, "Oh, you're safe.
[1:32:01] We're good." The one rolls over
[1:32:05] and the other one stands there looking
[1:32:06] like the boss. Or the other way around,
[1:32:08] the other one acts like a clown and
[1:32:10] starts jumping around crazily and runs
[1:32:12] all over and makes the other one chase
[1:32:13] him. Those dogs immediately knows you're
[1:32:16] not evil. We're friends. You cannot do
[1:32:19] that. You don't know that. You can't
[1:32:22] smell pherommones. You can't read
[1:32:23] thoughts. You can't read facial
[1:32:25] expressions. You don't know intentions.
[1:32:27] You don't know anything because you're
[1:32:29] so filled with all the corrupt word.
[1:32:32] When someone tells you, "Hi, how you
[1:32:35] doing?" in your head, "Yeah, you don't
[1:32:38] really care."
[1:32:40] You know why you even ask me this
[1:32:41] question? You spend every single day
[1:32:44] overanalyzing
[1:32:46] every single word or intention every
[1:32:48] person tells you. You are a stressed,
[1:32:52] pathetic creature
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; of sorrow and misery. A worm groing in
[1:32:59] the dust
[1:33:01] because you can't even tell a good
[1:33:02] person from a bad person.
[1:33:07] The reason I say that is this is why you
[1:33:11] need salvation and a dog doesn't.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; This is why you need the word of God.
[1:33:19] This is why your soul responds to truth.
[1:33:23] All right.
[1:33:25] So,
[1:33:27] born of the flesh. We were born of the
[1:33:29] flesh. I think I've got some quotes
[1:33:31] there.
[1:33:33] Um, let's go to the yellow part. And man
[1:33:37] was made to live with God in this
[1:33:39] manner. Yet, he has chosen to walk by
[1:33:41] his sight. He wants to be his own boss.
[1:33:44] He wants no one to tell him what to do.
[1:33:46] That's just the nature of man. You can
[1:33:48] go read the rest of the quotes. I'm I
[1:33:50] don't want to waste too much of time on
[1:33:51] it. The next one, looking at the unseen,
[1:33:53] man is made like a sheep. Then a sheep
[1:33:56] can find its way back. I'm told when
[1:33:58] it's lost is totally lost. And that's
[1:34:01] the way with man. When he's lost, he's
[1:34:02] absolutely helpless. He must have a
[1:34:05] shepherd to guide him. A man, when he
[1:34:06] chooses, as the days go on, we find man
[1:34:09] continually getting worse, choosing
[1:34:11] rather to walk by sight than step by
[1:34:13] faith, be the unseen. And when he does
[1:34:15] that, he robs the inner man which is his
[1:34:17] soul. Next quote, looking to the the
[1:34:20] unseen, man shall not live by bread
[1:34:22] alone. And the underlying part there,
[1:34:24] and a man's physical being to be taken
[1:34:26] care of is not all the reason God put
[1:34:28] him on the earth because what he does
[1:34:30] with his physical being amounts to very
[1:34:32] little. It's his soul what counts. It's
[1:34:35] the inward man that did not come from
[1:34:36] the earth. It come from heaven. That's
[1:34:39] the eternal part of the human being.
[1:34:42] eternity through time back to eternity.
[1:34:46] Man then when a man chooses to walk in
[1:34:49] his own way that's deviating from the
[1:34:52] original plan and do what he wants to
[1:34:55] do. God just lets him alone.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; See that's being God. Man must not think
[1:35:01] for himself but he must let the mind
[1:35:03] that was in Christ be in him. We are not
[1:35:05] to think for ourselves. We we are to
[1:35:07] call anything contrary to what he said
[1:35:09] as though it is not. No matter what our
[1:35:11] eyes claim to be, that's where we are
[1:35:13] coming to. All right? So this is the
[1:35:16] condition of man. You go back home, you
[1:35:17] read those quotes. It's telling you what
[1:35:19] man was created to be and what he has
[1:35:21] become. You basically want to be your
[1:35:24] own boss. From the time you are 2 years
[1:35:26] old and mommy says no and you say I
[1:35:29] still want to do it. Mommy says yes, you
[1:35:32] shall do this. No, I don't want to do
[1:35:34] it. From the time you were two and you
[1:35:36] become cognizant of choice, you begin to
[1:35:40] want to be your own boss
[1:35:44] until things go bad. Then you want our
[1:35:46] help.
[1:35:49] Okay? So here we are in this pathetic
[1:35:52] terrible condition. We lost our place.
[1:35:54] We deviated from God's will. We need
[1:35:56] redemption.
[1:35:58] He brings redemption. So redemption
[1:36:02] comes in two parts. Next slide,
[1:36:03] brothers.
[1:36:05] Part one is the first coming of Christ,
[1:36:09] the son of man to bring the Holy Ghost
[1:36:11] to the human vessel. Now, I could talk
[1:36:14] years on this. We're going to try and
[1:36:17] make this preede really sort of uh um u
[1:36:22] shorten it so that we can understand it
[1:36:24] quickly. Right? So, because of what Adam
[1:36:27] lost, he now has that king theophony has
[1:36:31] to become man.
[1:36:34] born through a woman
[1:36:36] and still be Adam,
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; right? So man had to be redeemed and
[1:36:45] that is Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:36:46] Brothers, you can put the next slide up.
[1:36:50] Brother Brandham's the words on the side
[1:36:52] is brother Ram's words. So God became
[1:36:55] man that man might become God.
[1:36:58] That's a direct quote from the message.
[1:37:00] God became man so that man could become
[1:37:03] God.
[1:37:05] Why? Because man was God in the
[1:37:07] beginning, lost his first estate, came
[1:37:11] to this beastly nature, has been living
[1:37:13] in this way for 4,000 years, and to
[1:37:17] bring him back full redemption, he
[1:37:20] becomes the Lord Jesus Christ. That's
[1:37:22] the purpose for Jesus Christ, right? So
[1:37:25] the first step is we need redemption. We
[1:37:28] need a man like the first Adam to bring
[1:37:31] back something to get us to believe
[1:37:33] because for 4,000 years we've been
[1:37:34] believing all sorts of trash. We made up
[1:37:38] cultures and religions and languages and
[1:37:41] and cave drawings and drawings of
[1:37:44] deities and all kinds of superstitions
[1:37:46] about stars and flowers and plants and
[1:37:48] animals. And we were worshiping the
[1:37:50] creation instead of the creator.
[1:37:53] And he now the creator himself has to
[1:37:55] come down and become us. This is what's
[1:37:58] amazing. So that logos
[1:38:01] that came out of the fountain of life
[1:38:03] becomes a man. Don't you love him
[1:38:06] saints?
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Born of the flesh but also through
[1:38:09] spoken word.
[1:38:12] He was spoken word in the womb of Mary
[1:38:14] that created that born through the
[1:38:16] woman. Right? King Theophony himself
[1:38:19] that we saw who was filled with all
[1:38:22] those attributes became flesh
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; and walked among us being born of woman.
[1:38:28] He was Emmanuel God with us.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; He was Adonai. He was I am with us. He
[1:38:35] became flesh. He subjected himself to
[1:38:37] time from eternity. Paused everything.
[1:38:41] Came down into time and existed for a
[1:38:44] short while with us in time. King
[1:38:46] Theophony himself became flesh. It's not
[1:38:49] just one attribute that became Adam.
[1:38:51] This is all of those attributes. And the
[1:38:54] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:38:57] And we beheld his glory.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he have in him? This is
[1:39:03] the this is the secret. Like Adam in the
[1:39:06] first time, in him were two sections of
[1:39:09] attributes, masculine and feminine.
[1:39:11] Amen. Let's read in the message Jehovah
[1:39:14] Gyra.
[1:39:16] So he created man out of the dust of the
[1:39:18] earth, not in his image. But when God
[1:39:20] came down in the form of man by Jesus
[1:39:21] Christ to redeem that the man that fell
[1:39:25] from the image of the earth, he was made
[1:39:27] in the image of the earth.
[1:39:30] He made himself a body. First he made
[1:39:32] himself in King Theophony in the in the
[1:39:35] form of man that was coming in the
[1:39:37] future. Now he makes himself in a
[1:39:39] fleshly body
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; of earth.
[1:39:44] There is no limit to God's love for us.
[1:39:48] There is no limit to his there's no uh
[1:39:52] place he cannot reach. And and we know
[1:39:55] he he doesn't even stop there. After
[1:39:56] Calvary, he goes right down into hell.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; His purpose was to take away man's guilt
[1:40:03] of sin and bring something new to man.
[1:40:07] Something new which never occurred
[1:40:08] before. the Holy Ghost in a new way to
[1:40:14] bring restoration.
[1:40:16] What has to happen is like Adam, right?
[1:40:20] Let's go to the next slide.
[1:40:22] There he's on Calvary.
[1:40:24] He died. Brother man said when they cut
[1:40:27] his side, it was symbolic of water,
[1:40:29] blood, and spirit which constitutes a
[1:40:32] birth. He said that's where the church
[1:40:34] was born.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; What's the church? the feminine
[1:40:39] attribute. The same way Adam was laid to
[1:40:41] rest and took out of his side the
[1:40:43] feminine attribute to produce the female
[1:40:45] of his connection of his being. He takes
[1:40:49] out the feminine attribute and the sewer
[1:40:51] goes forth to sew seeds. The Holy Ghost
[1:40:53] goes out to bring forth the feminist
[1:40:55] attribute over 2,000 years of church
[1:40:58] ages. The same fountain of seven colors.
[1:41:00] Those attributes from those seven colors
[1:41:03] is draw human beings are drawing from
[1:41:05] the divine nature. Add to your faith,
[1:41:08] virtue, virtue of knowledge, temperance,
[1:41:10] patience, godliness. Add to it the seven
[1:41:13] colors, the natures of man that were
[1:41:15] taken from him when he fell. He now
[1:41:17] sends us the dispensation of the Holy
[1:41:19] Ghost to bring forth spoken word. That
[1:41:24] is necessary. And how is he sending his
[1:41:26] spoken word? Seven stars in his right
[1:41:29] hand. Seven angels.
[1:41:32] Angels were purposed to bring the word.
[1:41:35] He could see they were going to be
[1:41:36] necessary, right? And then we said when
[1:41:39] he when he does this, man is born again
[1:41:42] of the word and theophony body begins to
[1:41:45] grow in heaven. You are here on earth in
[1:41:48] a fallen form, right? But because you
[1:41:52] believe in the word that he sent because
[1:41:53] of Calvary, because of the Holy Ghost,
[1:41:55] because of the token, because the blood
[1:41:57] cell was broken, because the life was
[1:41:59] coming out and the word was coming out
[1:42:01] in spoken word form, you now receive
[1:42:04] that. You receive a new birth and
[1:42:06] theophony begins to grow in heaven.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; We read this last week. While the
[1:42:10] spiritual birth is growing in your heart
[1:42:12] of God, there is a physical or celestial
[1:42:14] body growing to receive your spirit.
[1:42:17] When the life leaves this body, it goes
[1:42:19] to that body. Glory to God. Which brings
[1:42:22] us to part two of the redemption
[1:42:25] process. The first part was the first
[1:42:27] coming. What is the second coming? Amen.
[1:42:30] So the second coming of the son of man
[1:42:34] to unite the word body and the human
[1:42:36] vessel.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; The human vessel had been living in sin.
[1:42:41] He brought the Holy Ghost to bring the
[1:42:43] human body, the the sinful vessel back
[1:42:46] to being filled with the feminist
[1:42:49] nature.
[1:42:50] building up the church. He gave himself
[1:42:53] for the church that he might present her
[1:42:56] to himself without blame, without
[1:42:59] blemish, without spot, without wrinkle.
[1:43:02] The first coming, he died so that the
[1:43:04] feminist attribute could be manifested
[1:43:06] on this earth again. But the second
[1:43:09] coming is to unite the masculine and
[1:43:11] feminine.
[1:43:13] Then bringing the unity that's bringing
[1:43:15] the completion of Genesis 5:1 that in
[1:43:19] the beginning he created them male and
[1:43:20] female created them and called their
[1:43:23] name Adam. Redemption comes in two parts
[1:43:26] the first coming the second coming.
[1:43:28] Calvary and in this time he brings back
[1:43:30] the masculine attribute.
[1:43:33] Amen. Amen.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; The masculine attribute of the logos
[1:43:37] returns to earth as king theophony and
[1:43:40] makes him. So his first coming brought
[1:43:44] the feminist attribute.
[1:43:47] The second coming brings the masculine
[1:43:49] which is why it is the coming of Christ
[1:43:51] and he does it through the son of man.
[1:43:53] He's now in this day vindicating the
[1:43:56] masculine word
[1:43:59] that would cap the feminine
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; that has been manifest. The feminine has
[1:44:03] been manifest through the ages. She
[1:44:05] operated as the church. There was signs,
[1:44:07] wonders, there was healing. There was uh
[1:44:09] prophecies. There was discernment. There
[1:44:11] was the word being preached by the seven
[1:44:13] angels. There were all kinds of things
[1:44:15] related to the church. There was
[1:44:17] baptisms. There was communion. There was
[1:44:19] washing of feet. There was all kinds of
[1:44:21] ordinances. They were all feminist
[1:44:23] attributes. There was worship towards
[1:44:25] him. But yet you still were not
[1:44:27] connected with him.
[1:44:29] He sent you a witness, the Holy Ghost,
[1:44:31] to make those attributes, that feminine
[1:44:34] attribute become alive in you, waiting
[1:44:36] for the time that the masculine
[1:44:38] attribute should return in the message
[1:44:40] proving his word.
[1:44:42] Um,
[1:44:44] oh, before we get there, this is what
[1:44:47] this is.
[1:44:49] This is what 963 February 28th is.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; It is the masculine attribute returning.
[1:44:56] It is king Theophony the capstone the
[1:44:58] the scientist said made itself visible
[1:45:02] for 28 minutes
[1:45:04] which is about the space of half an hour
[1:45:06] which is the seventh seal the first fold
[1:45:09] of the seventh seal. He made himself
[1:45:12] visible for what? For a prophet on earth
[1:45:15] to know that is a vindication that the
[1:45:18] seventh seal is to be opened.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; What is the seventh seal all about? The
[1:45:24] seventh seal brings him back to earth.
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; We don't need him to come back to earth
[1:45:32] like 2,000 years ago cuz there's no need
[1:45:34] to bring the feminist attribute him in
[1:45:37] the form of flesh. He now is to come as
[1:45:39] king theophony to cap the fleshly body
[1:45:42] that is on earth.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; Proving his word. Do you see what I
[1:45:46] mean? It's son of man Jesus Christ will
[1:45:49] come down in human flesh among us and
[1:45:52] will make his word so real it unite the
[1:45:54] church and him as one. So what the
[1:45:57] masculine attribute would come down and
[1:45:59] show himself united with a prophet on
[1:46:02] earth to reveal the word of himself.
[1:46:08] That's what son of man ministry is. And
[1:46:11] then she'll go home to the wedding
[1:46:12] supper. She's already united. We go to
[1:46:14] the wedding supper all self all the
[1:46:16] flesh of mighty men cause the marriage
[1:46:18] of the lamb has come but the rapture is
[1:46:20] going to the wedding supper when the
[1:46:21] word here there it is unites with the
[1:46:24] person
[1:46:26] they two become one and then what does
[1:46:29] it do then it manifests the son of man
[1:46:32] again not the church theologians the son
[1:46:34] of man which means who is the bride the
[1:46:38] bride is going to be the full
[1:46:39] manifestation of the son of man
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; the bride will be the revealing of the
[1:46:44] son of man. Brother Benam was only the
[1:46:46] first fruits of that. This would be
[1:46:49] today the full redemption of man coming
[1:46:51] back to the original purpose. This
[1:46:54] coming is before the translation.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; This coming is before what you call the
[1:46:59] rapture, the transfiguration, the change
[1:47:01] of bodies from this state that we were
[1:47:04] lost in to the state that has been
[1:47:06] restored to us. Which means the coming
[1:47:09] we ought to have been looking for is the
[1:47:11] word himself, not Jesus Christ from
[1:47:14] 2,000 years ago.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; See, because we believe he came and
[1:47:19] released the feminine attribute, and
[1:47:21] we're waiting to be united with the
[1:47:23] masculine. That's what we're looking
[1:47:25] for.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; The coming of this full word will do two
[1:47:28] things. It will reveal the gene seed in
[1:47:30] you, the nature of the person you are
[1:47:33] meant to be. And number two, it will
[1:47:35] unite the theophony with the human
[1:47:37] vessel.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Because who does he come with in the
[1:47:40] seventh seal? Your theophonyies.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; He makes that dimension real to you.
[1:47:47] Have you heard from your theophony yet?
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; This will bring on the rapture which is
[1:47:53] the process of taking you into
[1:47:55] translation. How does this happen? Why
[1:47:57] does this happen? What is the gene seed
[1:47:59] attribute? The father. What is
[1:48:01] theophony? The word. What is the human
[1:48:04] being? The vessel. And it all comes
[1:48:07] together. The Godhead living in the
[1:48:09] vessel.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; When the vessel by free will today
[1:48:13] believes the word and accepts it, the
[1:48:15] father, the word unite, making it God
[1:48:19] again.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; But the vessel is not the perfect
[1:48:22] vessel. You say, being conceived of
[1:48:24] sexual desire, it will dissolve.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. When this house of this tabernacle
[1:48:29] be dissolved, that means there's a
[1:48:32] promise that the vessel will become new
[1:48:34] for the millennium, not born of a woman,
[1:48:37] but spoken into existence by King
[1:48:39] Theophony again.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It doesn't have to fly off
[1:48:43] somewhere. It's dissolved. That means it
[1:48:46] remains in the state of theophony
[1:48:48] waiting for the millennium where the
[1:48:50] body then is spoken into existence and
[1:48:52] you receive glorified condition. Saints,
[1:48:56] here's a quote from the oneness of God.
[1:48:59] Now, don't you see the great picture?
[1:49:02] We in flesh are different. We're like a
[1:49:05] byproduct of a created being by holy
[1:49:07] wedlock, but in spirit, we are sons and
[1:49:09] daughters, not some other spirit, but
[1:49:11] the spirit of the living God. We are in
[1:49:13] his likeness, in unity, in the perfect
[1:49:15] image of the living God. Because we
[1:49:17] become sons and daughters, not separated
[1:49:20] by the same spirit, the same God, the
[1:49:22] same person, joined in wedlock to the
[1:49:24] eternal.
[1:49:26] See how God planed that we should not
[1:49:29] be, we should be not a different but
[1:49:32] him.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; Not some other being of some other
[1:49:35] tribe, but a real union, an offspring of
[1:49:38] the almighty done by a holy union. Now
[1:49:42] the body comes from mother and father,
[1:49:44] but the spirit come from God. God
[1:49:47] separating himself as Adam was
[1:49:50] separated.
[1:49:53] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; That's the word of the message.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Nominal Christianity does not give you
[1:50:01] that. Amen.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; There is no other ideology or thought on
[1:50:05] this earth that tells you you can be
[1:50:08] worthy to be the final manifestation of
[1:50:11] God and that you are not required to be
[1:50:14] some blind worshipper, some bow downer.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; You are supposed to be him in the
[1:50:21] character that he meant for you to be.
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; So who is man? He was made to be the
[1:50:29] last unfolding of God. the last
[1:50:31] expressed attributes of the revelation
[1:50:33] of who God is. He is the vessel in which
[1:50:36] God can be properly known within time.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Not angels,
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; not lions, not elephants, not anything
[1:50:43] else. Man is the vessel through which
[1:50:46] God and all these attributes can be
[1:50:49] known in each one of you is a different
[1:50:52] attribute.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; So
[1:50:57] let's talk about you as we close.
[1:51:01] Okay, I'm going to read something.
[1:51:04] Brother Ram said, "If you ever was or
[1:51:06] ever will be in heaven, you was in
[1:51:09] heaven to start with.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; You're a part of God. You were his
[1:51:14] thought. He knew your name. He knew who
[1:51:17] you were before there was a molecule."
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Your mind going back to the fountain of
[1:51:22] life. And when King Theophony, you were
[1:51:25] there, right? Before there was a light,
[1:51:28] before there was anything, he knew you
[1:51:30] and your name. If you go to the next
[1:51:31] slide
[1:51:34] there, little children, that one little
[1:51:37] dot is you. Each one of you can choose
[1:51:40] one little dot in there. Each one of you
[1:51:42] sitting here, one of those attributes is
[1:51:45] you. And just like he did with the
[1:51:49] universe where he took a clinker off the
[1:51:52] main leg and threw it and let it go in
[1:51:54] time and he said stop.
[1:51:57] There's an attribute.
[1:51:59] Brother Ram said unless that germ of
[1:52:02] life was fore orained in you to be a son
[1:52:05] or daughter of God, you'll grow up
[1:52:06] deformed something but never be a real
[1:52:09] true son and daughter of God. In the
[1:52:11] message modern events made clear by
[1:52:13] prophecy paragraph 76 he said you're a
[1:52:15] gene of your father and you were in your
[1:52:17] father yet your father had no fellowship
[1:52:20] with you because you was in there but he
[1:52:22] you knew it not he knew it not and you
[1:52:25] were manifested that you might that he
[1:52:27] might fellowship with you and you being
[1:52:28] born again you're born of eternal life I
[1:52:31] want to get to par 77 then if you are
[1:52:33] son of God or daughter of God you are
[1:52:36] God all the time
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; But he knew here it is what bed and time
[1:52:45] that you would be planted.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Right. Young children Sunday school. God
[1:52:51] could see you were going to be born in
[1:52:53] 2016, 2017,
[1:52:56] 2019. God could see you were born in
[1:52:59] 2000, 2005,
[1:53:02] 2010. He could see when this vessel was
[1:53:05] going to be born and he knew which seed
[1:53:07] to stop
[1:53:10] in time and say there it is. He knew
[1:53:14] that vessel would match this attribute.
[1:53:18] How did he know? Cuz he knows the
[1:53:19] future. He knows all things. He could
[1:53:21] select a vessel by the attribute.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Right? So now you're made a creature, a
[1:53:28] son of God, manifested son or daughter
[1:53:30] of God to meet the challenge of the hour
[1:53:32] to vindicate the true and living God at
[1:53:34] this hour. The message that's coming
[1:53:36] forth in this day. So here it is. You
[1:53:39] were in him before the foundation of the
[1:53:41] world. Because Adam sinned, you were not
[1:53:43] able to come to the offhony first. You
[1:53:46] bypassed your theophony and you came
[1:53:48] straight to the body of flesh. But he
[1:53:49] saw in time the body of flesh coming. He
[1:53:52] let the attribute go and said, "Stop."
[1:53:54] When you were born, that's where you
[1:53:56] rest. He had to become Jesus Christ to
[1:53:59] bring your attribute to earth, your
[1:54:01] spiritual feminist attribute that was in
[1:54:03] him. He died like Adam, his side open to
[1:54:07] bring out the church. He sent seven
[1:54:09] stars, seven angels in his right hand
[1:54:12] through church ages to send forth the
[1:54:14] attribute. Not attributes that there
[1:54:16] were attributes that fell away. Not
[1:54:18] attributes that fell away. Those who
[1:54:19] were not attributes fell away, but those
[1:54:22] who were were sealed away.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. You were born in time. Th this is
[1:54:27] the reality. You who I'm speaking to in
[1:54:30] 2025, you were born under the last star,
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; the seventh star in his right hand.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; You come under that word. That word was
[1:54:41] sent forth. Those attributes under that
[1:54:44] seal found you
[1:54:46] &gt;&gt; when you were born through your mom and
[1:54:48] your dad and settled inside you. You
[1:54:51] didn't know the attribute was in there.
[1:54:54] Amen. He placed it there by his
[1:54:56] election, but you didn't know it all
[1:54:58] your life. Why did he choose me, brother
[1:55:00] Alistister? Why me? Why in this time?
[1:55:04] Am I better than somebody else? Am I
[1:55:07] better than Charlie Kirk?
[1:55:09] Am I better than some other person? Do I
[1:55:12] do more than than them? Do I do more
[1:55:14] than some great philanthropist?
[1:55:17] Why did he choose me? There's only one
[1:55:19] reason.
[1:55:21] He knows that you in this time will not
[1:55:25] deviate from his purpose.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Somehow or the other, he knows you'll
[1:55:32] have many mistakes, but for some reason,
[1:55:36] you will battle it out. You will
[1:55:39] struggle it out. You will fight it out.
[1:55:41] You will go through the hassles. You
[1:55:43] will go through the trials. But you will
[1:55:45] find his perfect will. And in the end,
[1:55:48] you will choose his will over your own.
[1:55:50] That's the only reason. You're not
[1:55:53] better than somebody else. You're not
[1:55:54] better than anything else in this world,
[1:55:56] but for some reason, you will choose his
[1:55:59] will and not your own. He knows that. I
[1:56:03] am resting on that.
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; That he knew I will make the choice in
[1:56:07] the end time. He placed it there by his
[1:56:10] election. You ask how did he know? He
[1:56:12] only knows that one thing. The
[1:56:14] attribute. You would do wrong things.
[1:56:16] You would go into drugs. You would
[1:56:17] smoke. You would commit adultery. You
[1:56:19] would fall. You would backslide. But in
[1:56:21] the end, you would make the choice that
[1:56:24] I will choose his will and not my own. I
[1:56:27] will falter. I will fall away. I will
[1:56:29] backslide. I will get up again. I will
[1:56:31] fight the systems of this world. But in
[1:56:33] the end, I will choose his will because
[1:56:35] there's something inside responding to
[1:56:37] the masculine word. And that feminine
[1:56:39] attribute can only respond to that one.
[1:56:42] And he's leading you to that all this
[1:56:44] life. Every choice, every mishap, every
[1:56:47] failure, every falling, he's leading you
[1:56:49] to there. Family will fall away, cousins
[1:56:52] will fall away, a wife, husband,
[1:56:54] children will will forsake you. Through
[1:56:56] all the hardships that everyone else
[1:56:58] will give up on, you will not. He has
[1:57:01] seen it. He will not let his attribute
[1:57:04] fall somewhere and it will return void.
[1:57:06] That will never happen because the
[1:57:09] beginning was where they deviated from
[1:57:11] his purpose. Why do we talk about
[1:57:13] purpose today? Because that's what it
[1:57:15] takes in the end time. He's going to
[1:57:17] reveal that purpose to you. And you will
[1:57:19] not say to him, "Lord, there's a better
[1:57:21] way. There's another way. I I can you
[1:57:25] will receive the revelation. You'll
[1:57:26] believe the revelation. You will stay
[1:57:28] true to it. That's the reason he chose
[1:57:30] you in this day. He comes down with your
[1:57:33] theophony in the opening of the seventh
[1:57:35] seal which is right nearby you in a
[1:57:38] dimension you cannot see but it is
[1:57:41] there. It's influence is there. Its
[1:57:43] power is there. That's how you know
[1:57:45] there's a deep calling and a deep
[1:57:47] responding.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; One day when your faith has reached its
[1:57:51] fullness, your eyes will be open to that
[1:57:54] by revelation and of who he is. When
[1:57:58] your eyes are open, the revelation of
[1:58:00] who he is, the masculine attribute, you
[1:58:02] will see who you are. By knowing who he
[1:58:04] is, you will know what man is. You will
[1:58:07] believe what man is. Amen. That God
[1:58:11] became man so that man can become God.
[1:58:14] Amen. And one day that word body, you
[1:58:17] will see it. Your eyes will be open to
[1:58:20] that dimension and you will drop this
[1:58:22] robe of flesh which was born in time and
[1:58:25] you will take up that theophony that is
[1:58:26] waiting for you and you will return
[1:58:28] again someday for the millennium to pick
[1:58:31] up a new body of flesh. Be like Adam was
[1:58:33] in the beginning. There are many others
[1:58:35] who have passed on and are waiting for
[1:58:37] you. They're rejoicing. They're not
[1:58:39] feeling delayed. They're not living in
[1:58:41] sorrow or with no hope. They're not
[1:58:44] asking you to hurry up because time
[1:58:46] doesn't exist there. But they are
[1:58:47] waiting for you because it has been
[1:58:49] revealed to them in that dimension. He
[1:58:52] revealed to them you cannot be complete
[1:58:54] without them.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; They have to come to the marriage. They
[1:58:59] have to make the choice. They have to
[1:59:01] bring back the victory that was lost
[1:59:03] there in the garden of Eden and right
[1:59:04] there before the foundation of the world
[1:59:06] back in that dimension where the first
[1:59:09] uh uh time where free will chose against
[1:59:11] God's will.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; Saints, they are waiting for us. Amen.
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; And it's real. It's as real as can be.
[1:59:19] I'm going to close. I'm going to tell
[1:59:21] you one more thing. This beautiful quote
[1:59:24] from Christ is the mystery of God
[1:59:25] revealed. It's not there on the screen.
[1:59:26] I'm going to read it for you. Lucifer is
[1:59:30] still working in these last days.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Notice paragraph 548. In his last days,
[1:59:36] Lucifer is doing the same thing. Can you
[1:59:39] see it? Congregation says, "Amen." The
[1:59:41] devil doing the same thing. Building up
[1:59:42] a hybrid church. Like God is bringing a
[1:59:45] church through the feminist attribute.
[1:59:47] He's bringing up a hybrid church, right?
[1:59:50] Building up a hybrid church by hybrid
[1:59:52] knowledge instead of the word. By
[1:59:54] intellectual men instead of born again
[1:59:56] men. Building an intellectual kingdom
[1:59:58] that will outshine Christ's little bitty
[2:00:02] flock.
[2:00:03] What is it that did that? Fallen angels.
[2:00:06] The Bible said it was fallen angels who
[2:00:09] listened to Lucifer instead of Christ.
[2:00:11] Who they once belonged to. Is that
[2:00:13] right? of 550. Now listen close. Fallen
[2:00:16] angels. What kind of angels? Luther,
[2:00:21] Wesley, Catholic, Pentecostals.
[2:00:25] Pentecostals who kept not their first
[2:00:28] estate like the angels did
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; and has fell to organization like
[2:00:35] Lucifer main hold at Nika. what they
[2:00:39] have done organized create ecumenical
[2:00:42] association of ministers to make an
[2:00:45] image to the beast as the Bible said and
[2:00:48] building a Christian economy that'll
[2:00:51] close the doors of this church and
[2:00:54] others like it see Lucifer at work. I'm
[2:00:58] trying to bring you to the three-fold
[2:01:00] revelation of the mystery of God. What
[2:01:04] did they do? They sold out to reasonings
[2:01:06] of wisdom and education like Eve did.
[2:01:09] Fallen angels did. Wesley was a man of
[2:01:13] God. But what followed him? Fallen
[2:01:15] angels got into it.
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; What was the angels first? Creative
[2:01:19] beings of God. But fell for Lucifer's
[2:01:21] wisdom.
[2:01:23] And you see what hap what they become
[2:01:25] fallen angels and organizations from men
[2:01:28] of God who was went forth to establish
[2:01:30] truths in the earth before their truth
[2:01:33] could go on and proclamate and get on
[2:01:35] the revelation of Christ fallen angels
[2:01:38] come in and took it over and made
[2:01:40] denominations out of it. That's the
[2:01:42] reason the revelation of the seventh
[2:01:45] seal mystery had to be unfolded. Now you
[2:01:49] see what they left off. If Luther would
[2:01:51] have went on, if it had been here, if
[2:01:54] Wes would have went on, if Pentecost
[2:01:56] would have went on, what they had done.
[2:02:00] So God had to cut them short. He said
[2:02:03] Pentecostals left their first estate
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; just like the fallen angels did. Now
[2:02:10] there's only one thing can happen. There
[2:02:12] has to be a message at the end time.
[2:02:14] There's nothing else can follow it. Now
[2:02:17] the ecumenical world has set up a regime
[2:02:19] that there can be no denomination and
[2:02:21] know nothing else to follow it. They're
[2:02:24] either in it or they're not in it. The
[2:02:26] fruit is on the top of the tree. The
[2:02:28] light is shining on the predestinated
[2:02:30] fruit. She is ripening into Christlike
[2:02:33] fruit bringing forth the same melaninous
[2:02:36] sweetness and the same spirit that he
[2:02:39] had in him. Hope you see it.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:44] Saints,
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; the seventh seal is open.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; The masculine has come down and shown
[2:02:49] you he can tabernacle in flesh.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; The mis that mystery is revealed to you.
[2:02:54] You're not going to accept Pentecostal
[2:02:56] doctrine. You're not going to accept any
[2:02:58] other doctrine. That's you're safe from
[2:03:00] that. Fallen angels have got no power in
[2:03:04] the word anymore because the masculine
[2:03:05] has come down. Right? This is the
[2:03:08] problem. Lucifer has one final play.
[2:03:13] What is your trial today? You don't have
[2:03:16] a word trial. You don't have a problem.
[2:03:19] There's nobody going to come tell you
[2:03:20] the seventh seal is not open and and
[2:03:22] sway you. There's nobody going to come
[2:03:23] to you and tell you William is a false
[2:03:26] prophet and sway you. There's nobody
[2:03:27] going to come to you and tell you
[2:03:29] serpent seal is not real. This is not or
[2:03:31] give you some other word. The seven seal
[2:03:32] is open. The masculine nature's been
[2:03:34] revealed. You know the word. What else
[2:03:38] can Lucifer do? There's one play he has
[2:03:41] that he has never done before.
[2:03:46] He is offering you a new Eden.
[2:03:52] He's never done that before. He's never
[2:03:54] had an Eden to offer you before.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Nothing else. The trial of this day.
[2:04:01] Lucifer cannot beat the open book with
[2:04:03] misinterpretation.
[2:04:05] We have the answer to the devil's
[2:04:07] question. We've got him beat on that. He
[2:04:10] tried the manifestation with Christ. He
[2:04:12] said, "Bow unto me. I'll give you the
[2:04:13] kingdoms of the earth." Said to him,
[2:04:15] "Stand behind me, Satan. Don't you
[2:04:17] know?" He knew that when the seventh
[2:04:19] trumpet is blown, the kingdoms of the
[2:04:21] the earth would become the kingdoms of
[2:04:23] the Christ and Christ and the bride. He
[2:04:24] said, "Right." But there's something
[2:04:27] else he's been building up. Brother
[2:04:28] Brandham priested. He's created Satan's
[2:04:31] Eden.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; He can't take you away from the
[2:04:35] masculine. He's offering you a new Eden,
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; a new world.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; A more comfortable life,
[2:04:44] &gt;&gt; a different way to live, a way to
[2:04:47] manipulate God's word so you can make a
[2:04:50] better earthly life in his Eden, that
[2:04:52] you would enjoy his Eden. This is going
[2:04:55] to crumble.
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; you try. You take your your excursions
[2:05:01] through this life, your careers, your
[2:05:04] your money, your homes, your cars, it's
[2:05:07] coming to crumbling
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; because this Eden cannot survive.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; There's this the third fold of the
[2:05:15] mystery is Adam and Eve going
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; back to Eden.
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; His last plague is to produce an Eden
[2:05:22] that will attract you away from your
[2:05:25] original plan.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; And that's your trial today. That's your
[2:05:28] purpose today is to fight that. This is
[2:05:31] not my purpose. This is not my home. I'm
[2:05:34] not going to fight to keep this life
[2:05:36] alive. I have to look to the life that
[2:05:38] is beyond this.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; There is an Eden waiting for me. There
[2:05:42] is a life waiting for me beyond the
[2:05:44] grave, beyond this life, beyond this
[2:05:46] flesh. There is a millennium coming
[2:05:48] where both masculine and feminine
[2:05:49] attribute will be made known. We'll be
[2:05:51] one. We'll be in marriage. There will be
[2:05:54] my masculine nature, my feminist nature
[2:05:56] manifested in myself and my wife in the
[2:05:59] millennium. There will be our children.
[2:06:02] You will plant and another shall not eat
[2:06:04] of it. You will build and another shall
[2:06:06] not live in it. There will be an economy
[2:06:08] that is beyond this Eden economy.
[2:06:12] That's your trap. That's where you are
[2:06:14] right now. This is the story of God and
[2:06:17] man. This is the last leg of the
[2:06:18] journey. According to him, all things
[2:06:21] have been done. If Christ availed, if
[2:06:24] all the messengers did their duty, if
[2:06:27] all those that are gone before us have
[2:06:29] fulfilled their purpose, we will fulfill
[2:06:31] ours.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. Let's bow our heads
[2:06:34] together.
