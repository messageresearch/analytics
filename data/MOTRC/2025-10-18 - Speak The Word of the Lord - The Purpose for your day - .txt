TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So as we close, what is the purpose of your day? And I went unto the angel and said unto him, give me the little book. And he said unto me, take it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And eat it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter. So you have, if you didn't know about something you have to do, here it is. Take it and eat it up. &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for you. &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. And I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. We all know that. And verse 11 says, "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." &gt;&gt; And this is where you got people saying, you see, we must prophesy. You must speak with tongues. No, you must prophesy to many tongues. &gt;&gt; That means many languages of the earth. You must you must prophesy. You must speak &gt;&gt; to the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's your purpose for today. So what's the purpose? Take the book. &gt;&gt; Speak the word. &gt;&gt; This has never been given to any other age before. &gt;&gt; This is the purpose of the bride today. &gt;&gt; Take the book. Speak the word. There it is. So what is your purpose, young people? speaking the word, &gt;&gt; taking the word. &gt;&gt; Now, this is what I find frustrating today is that people who are taking the word don't seem to be speaking. &gt;&gt; Either you feel pressurized that you're not allowed to speak, and I'm not just I don't just mean speaking as in with your mouth. Of course, you need to. It's telling you that the word that you took needs to be manifested &gt;&gt; to all kingdoms and nations and tribes and people, &gt;&gt; to your neighbor in the street, &gt;&gt; to the people you come in contact with. &gt;&gt; I feel like it needs to change. That's why we feeling like something is missing. &gt;&gt; There needs to be a shift. &gt;&gt; It needs to change. You got Pentecostal people, uh, denominational people, they they'll meet you somewhere and they'll they'll come up to you and say, "Have you been saved? Have you been born again?" And and you're thinking like, "If only you know." And then you walk away. &gt;&gt; What happened to your voice? &gt;&gt; What happened to your testimony? &gt;&gt; What happened to the witnesses? &gt;&gt; How are we going to fill Revelations 10:8-11? Number one, you can't do it unless you take the book. &gt;&gt; And you need the Holy Spirit to be able to take the book. The Holy Spirit is the one saying, "Take the book, eat it up." This is what's going to happen. You take that word in and then you have to speak it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, when I was uh a young man and running away from the ministry, a very humble minister who brought correction to me told me something. He said, "If you take the book and eat the book and you have this word inside you and you are not &gt;&gt; speaking it, it's going to corrupt you. &gt;&gt; You're going to be like a well that's it's got no &gt;&gt; expression. It's got it's not it's not releasing itself." And you and I understood what was happening because there I was sitting in the in the church listening to ministry and I'm and I'm sitting there and I can feel the thoughts of God coming in and I want to express him and I'm sitting there thinking but this preacher can go this way and he can go that way and he could say this and and then it's eating me up and then it's like why don't you say it and no I'm I'm not I'm too good for that pulpit. That's eventually what comes to you. It's your pride standing in the way to humble yourself and speak the word. Amen. So you got what they're pushing, the agenda they're pushing today outside of in in the message is go to these camps, go get slain in the spirit, go speak with tongues, go jump up and down and scream, but are you speaking the word? Because the purpose of the day is take the book, speak the word. We've got to find that. We've I believe the church needs to lead us into that. I believe the the ministry needs to lead us into that. Each one of us needs to become speakers. And yes, I know you say, you know, brother Al, I'm just a housewife. What what do I need to speak? Well, you are speaking to your children. You're speaking with your husband. You're speaking in your life. You're speaking with your friends, with your families. It's it's got to come to it now where your life is speaking, not just your words. So, what do I mean by life? And I'm not even talking about the codes and standards of the message. I'm talking about your joy of the word must be expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell it to your face, saints. &gt;&gt; Come on. See, it's got to be that. &gt;&gt; I I love his word. I love his word so much. I JUST WANT TO SHARE IT. I WANT TO FELLOWSHIP WITH IT. I WANT UNENDING FELLOWSHIP. &gt;&gt; We've got to be able to see that. Not forms of religion, but actual loving the word. I can't wait to wake up in the morning after my sleep. My sleep is wasting my time. You know, I want to wake up in the morning, open my coffee, and read the word and and and speak to someone, express it today. You know, I that's what we want to see in in the bride of Christ. That's what we want to see among the people. &gt;&gt; As we close this down, testimony of a true witness. Parable 186. What church? What's the That's the reason I can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost of crying, shaking, or speaking in tongues or any sensation. You hear it straight from the prophet. &gt;&gt; They're all right now. Them things are right. But the devil can impersonate that so real. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost is deity. &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in man. It's more than a sensation. It's more than speaking in tongues. is more than shouting in the spirit. It's more than weeping. IT'S MORE THAN JOINING CHURCH. IT'S God living in man. DEITY, GOD HIMSELF TABERNACLED into that person. WHEN HE CAN SPEAK, IT'S JUST THE SAME AS GOD SPEAKING. &gt;&gt; There's the call. He wants you to speak. That's the church of Jesus Christ. That's the way the first apostolic church WENT FORTH. AMEN. THAT'S this is what it is. THE PROPHET IS SAYING, "I CAN'T TAKE the baptism of the Holy Ghost of crying, shaking, speaking tongue, sensations. &gt;&gt; What I really want to see is God tabernacle deity in men speaking the word." &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh Corinthians book of correction. We notice Paul could teach the Ephesians there how that before the foundation of the world, they were predestinated unto the adoption of sons of God. The Corinthians didn't know anything about that. They had have a little feeling of something, a little sensation, one this and that and the other and they depended on that. He couldn't teach them the deep things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here it is. So I think it's great that you got people that you can teach deep things. Watch this. Taking the word. The Holy Spirit can wind these great truths and anchor into the people's heart so they know where they're standing. &gt;&gt; Sensation and no sensation. Prophecy, no prophecy, whatever it might be, take the word, speak the word. The prophet is telling us, what I really want to see is people you can teach the deep things to. &gt;&gt; They're not shunning it. They they're willing to take it. They're not fighting against it. Seventh seal is not open. How can this be? How can this must happen in the future? Uh the church goes up in Revelations 3 and comes back in 19 and nothing in between is to the bride. They haven't received the Holy Spirit. They haven't received the Holy Ghost for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have not responded to it because there's no word inside. Nothing's giving ability to even push the agenda. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Saints, good. &gt;&gt; Why do people feel they need sensations? Because they feel they need proof. &gt;&gt; Others around them also feel they need proof. Like I'm the minister. I need to see proof that you have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It's a private affair. &gt;&gt; It's between me and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. But even myself now, why do I need proof? Faith doesn't need proof. &gt;&gt; I believe first and evidence follows whenever it can. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I must believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So people feel insecure, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They don't they don't understand what's going on. They feel they need proof. Their feelings are more satisfied when they see evidence, visible evidence. &gt;&gt; Why can I not be like brother so and so? You know, he's so lucky. He's got a gift. He's got this or speaking with tongues or prophesying or he dreams dreams. She sees dreams or he's he has visions. What about me? I got nothing. Right? So I I feel insecure. I feel inferior. I need something. The truth is saints emotions and sensations could occur in in a way that reflects a true experience. It can the the reason should be that the body cannot contain the revelation that the Holy Spirit brings in you. What I'm saying to you is there should be some expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you get the word, when God convicts your heart, there should be an expression. &gt;&gt; There should be an amen in your soul. And and maybe you're struggling with complex or something and you you really want to scream out, but you just maybe feel like raising your hand for now. And maybe you feel like you're a little shy that somebody is seeing you or that you're afraid that somebody is going to say something, but there's something happening inside. And then there's other people who are just boisterous, flamboyant, sanguin people who it's their character that when anything touches them, they're just jumping, screaming, and shouting. It's just emotions. It's it's the way they're made. They're different. It's emotions. It doesn't mean anything &gt;&gt; to what is going on inside. It's just an expression &gt;&gt; of something. &gt;&gt; But they should be an expression. &gt;&gt; Amen. That expression indicates the worship. &gt;&gt; So the reason it is so dangerous, it is because people can have reactions for the silliest of things and it's not even relevant, &gt;&gt; right? Anyone can cry because they're sorry for what they've done. &gt;&gt; That's good because if you cry and you're sorry and you apologize for what you've done and you come into church and the word convicts you and you cry, that's good. It's good that you cry. It's good that you come and say, "I'm sorry, Lord. I repent. You know, I I want to put this right." You come and tell the pastor or something. You come to the altar and and you raise your hands. It's good that you do that. It still doesn't mean anything unless you have the Holy Spirit in you directing you to the word &gt;&gt; because even a person who does not have the Holy Spirit can feel sorry for what they did. That's right. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is and always has been about the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's the purposeful nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've had a reaction of sensations, then there must be a life of purpose that follows. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I don't know if I said this here before. Most of the people who hit the ground in the Bible were demonpossessed. &gt;&gt; Those who willingly went down to the ground in the presence of the Lord rose up and their lives were never the same again. &gt;&gt; They woke up with a purpose. &gt;&gt; They didn't go back to an old lifestyle. When Moses bowed his head down because the ground he was standing on was holy and took off his shoe. When he rose up from there, he became a deliverer of a nation. He didn't go back to sheep farming on the mountain. &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says the prophet says God found him walking around living a life of ease. &gt;&gt; This prophet &gt;&gt; and then he meets the presence of God hits the ground in the presence of God wakes up with a purpose. &gt;&gt; So if there is an experience or there is an expression or there is some kind of experience of the Holy Ghost your life must have purpose &gt;&gt; from there on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what we need to see. It is a purposeful nature. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that saints? &gt;&gt; If you had a reaction of sensations, there must be purpose. That must be evident. &gt;&gt; Everyone can be anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the earnest. But the Holy Spirit of promise does not come upon a person willy-nilly. &gt;&gt; It comes to the elect. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is it has a purpose. It has a directive. It leads to something in particular. It is the beginning of the process of adoption of a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're under tutors and governors. Go read Galatians chapter 4. &gt;&gt; A son, as long as he's not come to maturity, he's just a servant &gt;&gt; and he's under tutors and governors. But then when it comes to the end, he receives the spirit of the son, not gifts. He was under gifts all the time, tutors and governors. But now when it comes to the process of adoption to take purpose &gt;&gt; to fulfill the will of the father to come into that state of adoption you have to have the holy spirit within you not an anointing the divine nature the purpose of god to fulfill the work of the father to be an heir of all things. It signifies a closing of being under tutors and governors and becoming an heir of the promise. Saints, if we have the full fullness of the word, why do we need the baptism of the Holy Ghost in operation? I'm not saying you mustn't. I'm asking you a question. You say, "Brother Alistister, okay, look, we got the fullness of the word now. We got the open book. Doesn't that mean we don't need the baptism of the Holy Ghost?" No. You still need ability. The &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost gives ability for the present day. &gt;&gt; So that's what anointing is. It is ability. Otherwise, we're just sitting around doing nothing, &gt;&gt; right? With all this word feeding us and then sitting around doing nothing. You need anointing to incentivize you to give you direction what you what you need to do. It's like at a certain time you meet somebody, I don't know whether you use a bus stop here in Lima or wherever at the grocery store or something and somebody comes up to you and they notice something about you, something unique and they they seem to sense there's something different about you and they speak to you right there. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is important &gt;&gt; because it needs to give you ability &gt;&gt; to speak to this person, to see their soul, to sense what's going on, to speak the right word because you in your right mind, you're still worrying about what's happening, about the bills, about something that crashed into your car. And and right there, you're all flustered, you're confused, you're looking at a pop and wondering whether you should buy it. And someone comes up and says, "Hi, I need some help. You need the bre of the Holy Ghost to put all those worries away and focus your attention because there's something calling and there must be a deep to respond. &gt;&gt; Amen. There always is a need for ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we don't take the ability and make it our God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is his holy spirit in us which is the divine nature that leads us to it. So the word is what your soul, if you understand who you are, the word in your soul is what you are married to. This flesh and your mind is not married to that word. &gt;&gt; This flesh and this mind needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Young people, &gt;&gt; because this flesh and this body and mind has different abilities. In my life, I had abilities of playing cricket, being a sportsman, doing art, playing music. You know, playing music is a very dangerous thing. If you if you have gift or play by ear, you can pick up all sorts of tunes and play it. But when you get the Holy Ghost, you're going to dedicate that gift to only his purpose. &gt;&gt; See, but without the Holy Ghost, you're just going to drift anywhere with it. &gt;&gt; Right? Those abilities need to be reigned in to be used for the purpose of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word is what your soul is married to. But this animal needs the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; This animal needs the anointing. And the anointing is what gives it abilities it could not ordinarily have. That's why it's important. Anyone can be anointed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the earnest. But the Holy Spirit of promise comes to the elect. You believe him, saints? That's why the Holy Spirit is necessary. What is the Holy Spirit then? It is the influence of the word for your day. &gt;&gt; The purposeful nature. &gt;&gt; Spirit is nature. The Holy Spirit is the influence of the word for your day. And that influence is going to cause your body and your spirit to fall in line with the word that you are married to. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's understand that we came into this flesh. Uh born in sin, shapen in iniquity, come into this world, speaking lies as the prophet said. We we uh come with our own desires. We have our own ideas of things. We have our own way of doing things. We sometimes think, well, I'm just going to preach this this way and you know, people just have to accept it and uh this is how I do things. But it becomes ineffective unless the Holy Spirit is the one guiding us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand why they wrote it differently in the Bible? &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference? Do you understand the difference between the anointing and the person? &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference between the ability and the purposeful nature? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, you need to know when you read the word what it is that you have, what it is that you seek, &gt;&gt; what it is that God must give to you, what it is that you are lacking. Maybe if you have a desire in your heart to do something for the gospel, you need ability for that. And you need and God's ability is not going to be one that must bring failure. It must be a success for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're you other a lot of people will also feel like I want to I want to be a preacher but there's just no gift there. I want to be a pastor but there's just no wisdom in you. I want to be a deacon but you're just a big old softy who's never going to be able to correct anybody. And yet in a time of need God can give you the Holy Ghost to fulfill that need because the word has inspired you beyond what you what abilities you have. Yes. Sometimes a big old softy can be someone who can bring good correction. &gt;&gt; God can do that. Only God can change you and people the people will recognize the spirit of God has worked in his life. &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him saints. &gt;&gt; This is the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit. The purposeful nature of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads
