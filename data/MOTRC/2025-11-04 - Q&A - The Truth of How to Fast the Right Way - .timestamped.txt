[0:05] Greetings saints in the precious name of
[0:07] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[0:08] Certainly good to be with you this
[0:10] evening and uh thankful to be able to
[0:13] share God's word with you once again.
[0:17] It's always a special privilege to speak
[0:19] to the children of God and we are
[0:21] thankful for the opportunity to do so.
[0:23] So, we uh want to break this this
[0:28] evening from um the series on the book
[0:31] of Genesis, and I'd like to um get into
[0:35] a uh question and answers. Uh so, this
[0:38] will be question and answers 2025 part
[0:41] 7.
[0:43] And um we're going to be dealing with
[0:45] the truth of how to fast the right way.
[0:51] So, it's going to be about fasting
[0:53] um and the subject, the truth about
[0:55] fasting. And for a title, we're going to
[0:58] take fasting or feasting.
[1:01] So, we want to begin with Matthew 6:E 16
[1:06] for our text and then we'll read the
[1:11] question
[1:13] and then get to the message.
[1:18] So we're going to read Matthew 6:16-18.
[1:22] Says, "Moreover, when you fast, be not
[1:26] as the hypocrites of a sad countenance,
[1:30] for they disfigure their faces that they
[1:33] may appear unto men to fast. Verily I
[1:37] say unto you, they have their reward.
[1:41] But thou, when thou fastest, anoint
[1:44] thine head, and wash thy face, that thou
[1:47] appear not unto men to fast, but unto
[1:51] thy father which is in secret, and thy
[1:54] father which seeth in secret shall
[1:57] reward thee openly. Amen. The Lord add a
[2:00] blessing to his word. I also want to
[2:03] read the question
[2:05] before we begin speaking.
[2:09] So the question is a few Sundays ago you
[2:12] said if you really take a whole week to
[2:15] fast and pray the right way not
[2:19] traditionally and I tell you just to
[2:22] meditate on what Christ truly is to you
[2:24] and me. It will elevate you to another
[2:27] level of consciousness in this life. And
[2:31] the question is what did you mean by
[2:33] this? Please explain the right way to
[2:37] fast.
[2:39] Amen. So I trust you can see uh where
[2:43] the question comes from and so I would
[2:46] like to get into this question and
[2:50] explain
[2:51] uh what fasting is all about because I
[2:55] didn't realize excuse me the impact the
[2:58] statement would have made.
[3:02] I've been asked this question in similar
[3:04] fashion by a few people. So I put a few
[3:07] questions together to make it one
[3:09] question. The reason I feel the
[3:12] immediate need to answer this question
[3:14] is because I realize that words have
[3:17] consequences and people might hurt
[3:19] themselves if they don't know exactly
[3:21] what I meant. So if I said something
[3:23] like fasting for like 5 days and
[3:26] somebody goes and tries it and hurts
[3:28] themselves or you know uh tries to do
[3:31] something without having the proper
[3:33] guidance or knowledge or wisdom. Uh
[3:36] that's why I mean words have
[3:38] consequences.
[3:39] So I guess the most important question
[3:42] to start with is why is fasting
[3:45] necessary?
[3:47] Now for some folks it may not be
[3:49] necessary but eventually most of us
[3:52] reach a crisis in our lives where we
[3:54] feel like there is no way out and then
[3:58] in desperation we feel it necessary to
[4:01] lay before the Lord and approach him the
[4:03] right way. If we are going through that,
[4:06] if you're going through a tough time or
[4:08] you're going through some heavy trial,
[4:10] you need to know the balance because it
[4:13] is only by knowing the truth about
[4:16] fasting that we can be assured that God
[4:19] will hear us and acknowledge our fast.
[4:23] So, let's make this abundantly clear.
[4:26] The only reason for rituals like
[4:29] fasting, like communion and many other
[4:33] things that have been deemed rituals in
[4:37] uh Christendom.
[4:39] Uh the reason for these rituals being
[4:41] created in the first place were to help
[4:44] those who were weak in the faith.
[4:48] Then if the rituals seem to work by that
[4:51] I mean after many people would do these
[4:54] rituals and then they would gave they
[4:56] would gain a positive testimony they
[4:59] would give this testimony
[5:02] and if it worked during that season of
[5:04] time then people began to place faith in
[5:07] the rituals and then the rituals became
[5:10] traditions and that's how things uh
[5:14] worked and why it evolved into what we
[5:17] have today.
[5:19] Those who created the rituals
[5:22] um make certain that they pass it on to
[5:24] the next generation
[5:26] and then they charge that generation
[5:29] before God that they had better keep it
[5:32] if they wanted good results or if they
[5:35] didn't want something bad to happen to
[5:37] them. But going back to the very
[5:40] beginning uh when fasting was a practice
[5:45] um fasting was not started by God.
[5:48] Fasting was not instituted by God. It
[5:51] was started by God conscious men though.
[5:55] Uh at first it was just something that
[5:57] men of God did when they were called of
[6:00] God to the wilderness to be spoken to by
[6:03] God. And of course, if you're leaving
[6:06] your village or your town or wherever
[6:08] you are and you go off into the
[6:09] wilderness, you're not going to find
[6:12] food easily or water easily. So then
[6:16] they would come back and they would
[6:17] testify that they went many days without
[6:20] food or water.
[6:22] And later it was taken over by all
[6:26] religions.
[6:27] As men became more learned, more
[6:30] educated, they began to teach scientific
[6:33] reasons for fasting. They found out that
[6:36] there were health benefits to fasting on
[6:39] a day of the week or maybe a few days.
[6:42] And they found that um they claimed that
[6:46] fasting allows the body to become one
[6:48] with the soul. It became something of
[6:51] philosophy and became a practice among
[6:53] religions of the earth that were not
[6:55] even uh Jewish or Christian. Right? And
[7:00] uh eventually fasting became part of
[7:03] something called meditation.
[7:06] Now knowing that it occurs in all
[7:09] religions, you cannot say it is
[7:12] exclusively a Christian thing. So what
[7:15] we can confirm is that it was a human
[7:19] behavior started for some reason which
[7:22] we can only speculate about. Right? So
[7:27] the best we can know is that humans
[7:29] figured out that for um um for treatment
[7:34] of some diseases they had to stay away
[7:37] from food until they were better.
[7:39] Another reason was that they had to
[7:41] learn to conserve food maybe for as long
[7:44] as possible. And um they found that
[7:47] fasting caused people to be still
[7:52] and lose uh uh energy but also use up
[7:56] less energy. If you were not eating and
[8:00] drinking and you were abstaining from uh
[8:03] the world or from people and you tend to
[8:05] be still, you tend to be calmer and so
[8:08] on. So it was actually a good form of
[8:11] control. Sometimes for villages if the
[8:14] holy men of villages or witch doctors or
[8:17] religious men of the villages would
[8:20] would actually see that it would be
[8:22] beneficial to teach the village to fast
[8:26] maybe one day in a week. And they found
[8:30] telling them it was a religious thing,
[8:31] it was a spiritual thing but in the
[8:33] meantime they're just conserving food.
[8:36] So, and sometimes, especially when food
[8:38] is in short supply during certain
[8:40] seasons in a different part of the
[8:42] world, instead of telling them we need
[8:44] to conserve food, they could tell them,
[8:46] you know, the gods require you to do to
[8:49] do this. So, religious tribal leaders
[8:51] would have to make up stories from the
[8:54] gods as to why the people needed to fast
[8:58] in the hope of getting more food later.
[9:02] So of course then comes the uh
[9:06] psychological effects and um this became
[9:09] a problem. So
[9:12] um tribal leaders witch doctors and
[9:14] spiritual men they were not ready for
[9:17] the psychological effects of long-term
[9:19] fasting
[9:21] uh and and the the effects it would have
[9:23] on people. So um it started off well you
[9:27] know this was conserving food this was
[9:29] teaching people discipline but then
[9:32] these um as they experienced more and
[9:37] men would try to fast for longer you
[9:39] know if you if you tell somebody that
[9:41] fasting puts you closer to God and then
[9:43] you get you know ambitious people say
[9:46] all right I want to be closer to God I
[9:48] want to extend my fast I want to go
[9:49] several days and so the these tribal
[9:53] leaders and and religious men did not
[9:57] know the psychological effects and they
[9:59] were about to experience it over time.
[10:02] So they realized with experience that
[10:06] not eating food and not drinking water
[10:09] for extended periods caused drops in
[10:12] blood pressure, sugar levels and
[10:15] therefore energy levels. and the brain
[10:18] releases more norepinephrine
[10:20] uh and cortisol which raises stress
[10:23] levels. So when that happens it first
[10:25] causes headaches and irritability which
[10:29] then get the person to search for food
[10:32] for comfort and if not controlled leads
[10:36] to violence and criminal thoughts and
[10:39] tantrums.
[10:40] So to break it down very simply, if you
[10:42] starve a child for a whole day, the
[10:46] child becomes seriously misbehaved or
[10:50] terribly behaved. Uh over time, if you
[10:54] starve a person longer, they start to
[10:57] become ravenous, violent, and this
[11:00] animal nature breaks out in them, and
[11:02] they'll they'll do crazy things just to
[11:05] get food. So what I'm explaining to you
[11:08] is the biological and and psychological
[11:10] effects of abstaining from food for long
[11:14] periods. So if you can contain people
[11:19] while they are in a fast and you can
[11:24] contain them till they are past that
[11:26] point of terrible stress then they start
[11:31] to slow down even more and they enter a
[11:35] meditative state. All right. So men who
[11:39] eventually learned this learned that
[11:43] they could even control people this way.
[11:45] So it's completely biological, right?
[11:48] The brain switches the body into eating
[11:51] its own protein first, which then
[11:53] decreases muscle mass and then even
[11:56] labor's heart muscle. So then this
[11:59] healthy brain realizes that there's
[12:02] danger and it switches to the to eating
[12:05] up the body's fat storage and realizing
[12:08] that energy is not being brought into
[12:11] the body and start it starts to secrete
[12:13] enzymes in the brain to psychologically
[12:16] preserve the life of the body. Why am I
[12:19] telling you this? because it causes the
[12:21] person to switch from the reasoning and
[12:24] logical part of the brain and causes the
[12:27] creative part of itself to become more
[12:31] active. Again, why am I telling you
[12:33] this? Because after more extended period
[12:37] of fasting,
[12:39] uh people start to feel more spiritual.
[12:43] They begin to dream more. You remember
[12:45] your brain is sensing a panic in the
[12:48] body. You you went past a period of
[12:50] hunger. You went past a period of
[12:51] desperation. You start to slow down. The
[12:54] body start to feel panic. The brain
[12:56] switches from the reasoning and logical
[12:58] to the creative part. And when you
[13:01] switch to the creative part, you start
[13:02] to have dreams. You start to
[13:04] hallucinate. And the people will start
[13:07] having spiritual experiences which they
[13:09] claim to be real. They start seeing
[13:12] things. And they will speak strange
[13:14] things and not respond properly to
[13:16] people. And that's what happens when and
[13:19] you can see that in places where there
[13:22] are real povertystricken countries that
[13:25] are gone through maybe a famine or
[13:27] drought and they haven't eaten in days
[13:30] and they start to see things. They start
[13:32] to um think on a more creative uh
[13:36] manner. It's it's the body's way of
[13:38] protecting uh the brain and the body.
[13:41] Now, 4,000 years ago, people thought
[13:44] this was their god coming upon a person
[13:47] where after some days of abstinence,
[13:50] they start to become more spiritual and
[13:52] start to hallucinate, start to see
[13:53] things. They thought the god was coming
[13:55] upon the person and taking over their
[13:57] vessel. And a person could fast for long
[14:00] periods and receive messages from the
[14:04] gods apparently. And uh the person that
[14:08] received those messages was deemed to be
[14:10] a very spiritual person and became
[14:13] wellresected in villages. And um as man
[14:17] developed and societies became better
[14:20] and sourcing food and defending
[14:22] themselves from invaders and fending for
[14:24] themselves, they realized there was no
[14:26] longer need for fasting. So it began to
[14:29] disappear as countries became wealthier
[14:32] like today and societies learned uh
[14:35] dependence uh on one another and peace
[14:39] was kept in the world over the last few
[14:41] hundred years. Fasting became something
[14:44] only kept by religious people because of
[14:48] tradition. So what am I saying? Most
[14:51] people in the world don't care about
[14:52] fasting anymore. which doctors
[14:55] themselves are picking up a lot of
[14:57] weight. They don't seem to be uh uh
[15:00] fasting much anymore.
[15:03] So I would say it's only in the last uh
[15:06] few decades that people have become
[15:08] interested. I I would say from what I've
[15:12] seen on the internet and uh YouTube and
[15:16] you know news reports and so on is that
[15:20] in the last decade or or so scientists
[15:23] uh studies on health and and and they've
[15:27] showed the benefits of short-term and
[15:29] long-term fasts to help people with
[15:32] weight loss. I think I don't think
[15:34] there's many people in the world today
[15:36] who have not heard the term intermittent
[15:38] fasting and so they've been discussing
[15:41] these things and the healing from
[15:42] diseases and and uh healing from
[15:45] depression and other behavioral things.
[15:48] Right? So, but you need to understand
[15:52] that fasting for certain amount of time
[15:56] actually causes psychological and
[15:58] biological effects that are very very
[16:02] crucial to understand when you mix it up
[16:05] with religion.
[16:07] All right. So, I want to read a quote
[16:11] um and I want to
[16:14] um just show you some things the prophet
[16:16] speaks about. Right. So we'll we we're
[16:18] going to get to the positive
[16:21] uh effects uh first and then we'll get
[16:23] to some other things and then also the
[16:26] negative effects. So if we look at
[16:28] Israel and the church part two paragraph
[16:30] 183 he says God shake this little old
[16:32] church like never before. May the Holy
[16:34] Ghost get a hold of every person here.
[16:37] Cause them to fast and pray and lay on
[16:39] their face day and night screaming out
[16:40] Lord until the oldfashioned revival
[16:43] breaks out here uh Lord and sweeps. So
[16:46] he's praying all out through here sends
[16:47] in an oldfashioned time that'll bring
[16:49] men and women back to God. Granted,
[16:52] Father, for we ask it in Jesus name. All
[16:54] right. So
[16:58] um in this time the prophet was praying
[17:02] that people would fast to become more
[17:05] desperate to reach out and desire to
[17:07] make contact with God.
[17:10] uh holiness had become so far from the
[17:12] church and fasting was definitely a
[17:15] solution
[17:16] for someone who is weak in faith and
[17:18] wants to become close to God. Um they
[17:23] would say you need to fast and pray. If
[17:26] you remember in the Pentecostal
[17:27] churches, of course, they would take
[17:28] this the scripture where um you know the
[17:32] disciples came to Christ and said these
[17:34] demons are not listening to us and you
[17:36] know they were complaining and uh he
[17:39] kind of told them well if you if you
[17:41] want to go out and cast out devils you
[17:43] better fast and pray right so I'm just
[17:45] paraphrasing it but so they took that
[17:48] the Pentecostal church took that and
[17:50] they made it a thing where if they were
[17:53] going if if they were called upon
[17:54] someone to do some to do some exorcism
[17:58] or something, then they would put
[17:59] themselves under a fast. And
[18:02] unfortunately, the Bible doesn't really
[18:04] tell them how long, what you should do,
[18:08] because he was speaking to a generation
[18:10] at the time that knew what fasting was.
[18:14] This generation 2,000 years later does
[18:17] not know. They assume that they know,
[18:21] and they cause themselves whole loads of
[18:23] trouble.
[18:24] All right. So, but for somebody who is
[18:27] weak in faith and at the time that he
[18:29] was speaking, there was a way of fasting
[18:31] for that person and that's the part that
[18:34] where we need wisdom is there is a way
[18:36] of fasting for someone who is weak in
[18:39] faith faith for them to increase their
[18:41] faith. There is a way there needs to you
[18:45] need to specifically know how to fast
[18:47] when you are weak in faith. All right.
[18:51] I want to share another quote with you
[18:52] to show you the contrast of uh
[18:56] spirituality today in uh the Christian
[18:59] churches and it's it's really shocking
[19:02] and I like that the prophet says this in
[19:04] the message conferences he says we
[19:06] notice one thing that when a man when
[19:08] men have conferences of the nations they
[19:11] get together and they find a big place
[19:14] and they feast and they have great
[19:15] dinners and they sit at the table and
[19:18] they have social drinks sociable drinks
[19:21] and they get ready and they uh go out
[19:23] from there to try to accomplish what
[19:25] they have selected in their minds to do.
[19:28] How different it is from God's
[19:30] conferences. Listen to this saints. Men
[19:32] don't come together in God's conferences
[19:34] to eat. They come together to fast and
[19:38] to pray and to receive orders and go
[19:42] forward with it. Amen.
[19:46] So here I find a major failing among
[19:52] God's people today and among Christian
[19:54] churches today. Everything seems to be
[19:57] more about food and celebration instead
[20:00] of consecration and communication with
[20:02] God. I mean you it's almost as if you
[20:06] can't organize an Easter convention
[20:09] without there being a priority on food.
[20:12] You can't uh um organize a Christmas
[20:17] convention or any convention or combined
[20:19] meeting or anything
[20:21] uh where children of God get together
[20:24] but you have to um feed them and if the
[20:29] food isn't right then they are unhappy
[20:31] and then they're they're miserable and
[20:34] they're complaining against the
[20:35] leadership.
[20:37] And look at what he says. When men of
[20:39] God come together it's not about food.
[20:41] It's about fasting, right?
[20:45] But you can't tell Christians that
[20:46] today, right? Notice at [clears throat]
[20:49] at our gatherings among Christian
[20:52] churches, even spiritual ones, how the
[20:54] people look forward for the preacher to
[20:56] finish up quickly because they uh can
[21:00] get to the food. They they're hungry.
[21:02] They're thinking about the food. And our
[21:04] spiritual gatherings among Christian
[21:06] churches today should never place more
[21:09] emphasis on food. If it were a fast, it
[21:13] would be more beneficial. But in today's
[21:16] world, if you had to tell people, uh,
[21:18] please come to the meetings, there's
[21:19] going to be a fast, you'll probably have
[21:22] less than half the crowd you would
[21:24] normally expect.
[21:26] All right, so um, let's have a look at
[21:29] this subject of personal fast. And I'm
[21:33] going to share with you another quote
[21:36] in the message perseverance. He says,
[21:39] "Today I was sitting in the room. We had
[21:42] usually Fridays a fast day for me." So I
[21:44] want you to see what the prophet says.
[21:46] Usually Fridays a fast day for me. I
[21:52] don't eat on sometimes Tuesdays and
[21:54] Fridays till sometime in the afternoon.
[21:56] Just a little. That's not a regular
[21:58] fast. That's just a couple of days a
[22:00] week. So, for those of you who can see,
[22:04] the prophet actually did intermittent
[22:05] fasting, like sometimes Tuesdays and
[22:08] Fridays. I don't know why it's Tuesdays
[22:10] and Fridays. You don't have to make a
[22:11] tradition out of it, please. Um, but he
[22:14] kind of did intermittent fasting of some
[22:17] sorts. And I don't know if he even knew
[22:18] that term, but anyway. He says that's
[22:21] not a regular fast. That's just a couple
[22:23] of days a week to fast. So, now watch
[22:26] this. So a long fast comes in more days
[22:31] when the Lord puts it upon you. So you
[22:35] don't decide this, right? And he says,
[22:38] but that's just in respect in honor of
[22:41] God's great memorial to us, the fasting,
[22:43] a command. So after 3:00, usually I have
[22:47] a little something light. Now notice
[22:50] after 3:00, he means 3:00 in the
[22:53] afternoon, right?
[22:55] So here he speaks about a personal fast.
[22:59] If you do something personal that is
[23:01] between you and God and its purpose is
[23:04] to honor God for his word and your
[23:06] salvation and it it's an amazing thing
[23:08] to do and it can be so beneficial for
[23:11] your spiritual walk but one should never
[23:15] do it unless you are mature in the word.
[23:17] This kind of fast where it goes on for a
[23:20] lengthy period several days maybe.
[23:24] Here is the wisdom. Do not do those
[23:27] fasts if you are not a mature person.
[23:30] And I mean mature in the word. Right?
[23:33] There needs wisdom here. Your fasting
[23:36] time. Here's another thing. Do not
[23:37] succumb to peer pressure. U churches
[23:40] shouldn't be telling people, "All right,
[23:43] this Tuesday we're going to go on a fast
[23:46] this Monday or something like that.
[23:47] We're going to go on a fast for so many
[23:49] hours and this is what we're going to
[23:50] do. We're going to lay this out."
[23:53] If there's wisdom behind it and it's
[23:55] reasonable, you know, a couple of hours
[23:57] and there's there's something set for
[23:59] the people to do, I suppose it's okay.
[24:02] But fasting long periods of time should
[24:06] not be set by anyone. The time should
[24:09] not be set. It is between you and God.
[24:12] And nobody other than those who live
[24:15] with you should actually know about it.
[24:17] And the reason why those who live with
[24:19] you should know about because they
[24:21] should respect that you are fasting
[24:24] and uh not do things to interrupt that
[24:27] because it should be seen as something
[24:30] that you have you are consecrating
[24:32] yourself before God.
[24:34] So in other words, there should be no
[24:36] psychological pressure of any kind from
[24:40] anybody spiritual or church leadership
[24:43] or anybody making sure you do you do it
[24:48] so others would like there shouldn't be
[24:51] a situation where you are making sure
[24:53] others know that you are fasting like
[24:56] the way you put it up on social media.
[24:58] So we're fasting today and we're doing
[25:00] this from this time and that time. The
[25:02] moment you make it public, you put
[25:04] pressure on other people. Okay, they're
[25:05] fasting. We should do this, too. And
[25:07] that's like group think. That's not
[25:10] something spiritual. That's not
[25:11] something where it's something between a
[25:13] person and God. That's like keeping up
[25:15] with the Joneses or, you know, because
[25:18] those people are fasting, they're going
[25:19] to become more spiritual. We need to
[25:21] catch up with them. It's ridiculous.
[25:24] It's how humans think. It's immature.
[25:28] And unfortunately, that's what happens.
[25:29] And I believe there's wisdom in the word
[25:31] that's telling you don't go around
[25:34] telling people you are going to fast.
[25:36] Keep it private.
[25:38] However, this kind of fast uh should not
[25:42] be a long fast, right? It should be as
[25:46] much as you can handle
[25:49] or else you are going to bring a
[25:50] reproach upon the word.
[25:53] And it must not be a tradition. It must
[25:55] have one purpose to it. Right? There
[25:58] must be a purpose to your fast. All
[26:01] right, I want to show you this
[26:03] beautiful, absolutely beautiful quote.
[26:07] And to me, this is uh I would say the
[26:12] foundation, the anchor, the the central
[26:16] theme of fasting. And uh it's where my
[26:19] title comes from, the message paradox,
[26:23] paragraph 76. And I took this Bible and
[26:26] just pulled it open like that. and my
[26:28] thumb was laying at 1 Corinthians the
[26:30] 5th chapter the 8th verse when something
[26:32] reads something like this when you come
[26:34] I was planning on taking a fast to the
[26:36] Lord I told him I'd go out and fast said
[26:39] when you come to this feast right he was
[26:42] reading and now watch what he says which
[26:45] a fast in the body is a feast with the
[26:49] Lord we know that so when you come to
[26:53] this feast don't come with the old
[26:55] leaven or the leaven of malice and so
[26:57] forth that come with the unleven bread
[26:59] of sincerity and truth. Just exactly
[27:02] what he told me in the vision. Come, God
[27:05] is my solemn judge. Come with the
[27:07] unleven bread of sincerity and truth.
[27:09] That is the word. Then I seen what he
[27:12] meant.
[27:13] Saints,
[27:15] a fast with in the body is a feast with
[27:20] the Lord. This is the truth about
[27:23] fasting. And this is the problem with
[27:26] people because this is where they fail.
[27:29] Fasting is a feast of the word. It's not
[27:34] abstinence,
[27:35] right? Uh and that's what it should be
[27:38] seen as. So if you're saying you're
[27:40] going to fast, what you're actually
[27:41] saying is I'm going to feast on the
[27:43] word. So it's not a time for you to beg
[27:47] and plead with God for something you
[27:49] need. You shouldn't be fasting for those
[27:52] reasons. It's not a time to beg God to
[27:54] help you cast out a devil. Neither is it
[27:57] time to set a test for God. Lord, I'm
[28:00] setting a test for you. I'm going to
[28:01] fast before you. I'm setting a fleece
[28:03] and so on. No.
[28:05] And not just and not just eat the word
[28:08] as in, you know, I'm going to fast. I'm
[28:10] going to read my Bible. I'm going to,
[28:12] you know, randomly going to turn over
[28:14] into Psalms and read as as much verses
[28:16] as I can.
[28:18] No, it's not just eat the word. It's
[28:21] feast on the word. It's eat as much as
[28:25] you can. It's indulge yourself. It's
[28:28] celebrate the word. Uh when that comes
[28:31] upon you, the desire when that that
[28:35] desire to feast on the word comes upon
[28:38] you, the then the desire for natural
[28:40] necessities and it decreases you. You
[28:44] don't desire natural food. And you know
[28:47] um I find that very often when I'm
[28:52] studying here in my study and I'm I'm uh
[28:54] into a subject and I lose track of all
[28:58] time. I lose track of um that I've
[29:00] missed my 10:30 coffee or you know and
[29:04] I'm missing lunchtime and I was hungry
[29:07] and then I'm looking at my I'm um I'm
[29:10] usually looking at my watch but then
[29:12] when something is taken over and I'm
[29:13] engrossed in the word and I'm just
[29:15] enjoying it then I lose track of it. I
[29:18] forget that I'm hungry. I forget that
[29:19] I'm thirsty and then after I'm done it
[29:23] all comes crashing back. Right? So I'm
[29:25] just telling you this is an experience
[29:28] that when you feast on the word you lose
[29:30] track of time you lose desire for
[29:33] anything natural.
[29:36] Now, how powerful that would be for any
[29:39] Christian.
[29:41] uh you know if you could feast on the
[29:44] word. If you gave yourself if you gave
[29:47] yourself to the word, you know, give
[29:51] yourself um a day like that once in a
[29:54] while, you know, knowing that with the
[29:57] abundance of spiritual food that we have
[30:00] in messages in the Bible and, you know,
[30:03] brothers who preach and things on um
[30:07] messages that are recorded.
[30:09] I mean, our fasts in 2025 would be the
[30:13] greatest ever, right? And I would
[30:16] encourage men, especially young men,
[30:18] when you're not married and you don't
[30:21] have children, you don't have cares of
[30:22] the world like us married men do,
[30:25] you know, and especially to do this as
[30:28] leaders of your homes. if you are
[30:30] married, if you're a pastor, if you're
[30:32] if you're a deacon, you're you're some
[30:34] leader
[30:36] to have times of consecration where you
[30:39] feast with the word. I'm not even saying
[30:42] go deprive yourself of food or go lock
[30:44] yourself away in the mountains. No, I'm
[30:47] just saying that it's so important in
[30:51] this day for men of God to feast on the
[30:55] word. This is what's lacking in today's
[30:59] world. Okay. So, I want to talk about
[31:03] the result of a fast. And the result of
[31:07] any fast before God should result in
[31:11] only this.
[31:15] Are you listening? The result of your
[31:17] fast must be that you become stronger in
[31:22] faith after your fast and stronger in
[31:25] the Lord no matter what the fast is
[31:28] about. So if there was a matter you were
[31:31] bringing up to God, if there's a need in
[31:34] your life, if you're going through a
[31:35] trial,
[31:37] whatever it is, the person who is
[31:40] fasting
[31:42] must become stronger in the faith and in
[31:45] the Lord, no matter what the fast is
[31:47] about. If not, if you finish your fast
[31:51] and you're not stronger in faith, then
[31:53] the fast was not a true fast and God was
[31:56] not in it. That's a problem. All right.
[31:59] So, let's go to um scripture. I'm going
[32:03] to read a scripture for us
[32:06] um
[32:09] that's in 2 Samuel 12.
[32:12] 2 Samuel 12:15-23.
[32:14] And this is
[32:16] um a little story of David when he lost
[32:20] his child
[32:22] um through Ba Sheba, the first child
[32:24] through Bath Sheba. Verse 15. And Nathan
[32:27] departed unto his house. That's Nathan
[32:29] the prophet. And the Lord struck the
[32:31] child that Uriah's wife bear unto David,
[32:35] and it was very sick. David therefore
[32:38] besought God for the child, and David
[32:40] fasted, and went in and lay all night
[32:42] upon the earth. That means he was lying
[32:44] on the ground, and he fasted. And the
[32:47] elders of his house arose. That means
[32:50] servants and people who were taking
[32:51] care.
[32:53] The um the head servants of the house
[32:56] went to him to raise him up from the
[32:59] earth. But he so it means they were
[33:01] trying to pick him up and he would not
[33:04] neither did he eat bread with them. He
[33:06] refused to eat uh anything they
[33:08] prepared. And it came to pass on the
[33:10] seventh day that the child died. And the
[33:13] servants of David feared to tell him
[33:15] that the child was dead. For they said,
[33:17] "Behold, while the child was yet alive,
[33:20] we spoke to him. We spake unto him, and
[33:23] he would not hearken unto our voice. How
[33:25] will he then vex himself if we tell him
[33:28] the child is dead?" So, in other words,
[33:32] you know, while the child was alive, we
[33:34] tried our best and he wouldn't listen to
[33:36] us. What would happen if the if we tell
[33:39] him now the child is dead, we'd rather
[33:40] just leave him alone. Verse 19 says, '
[33:43] And when David saw that his servants
[33:45] whispered? David perceived that the
[33:47] child was dead. Therefore, David said
[33:49] unto his servants, "Is the child dead?"
[33:52] And they said, "He is dead." Then David
[33:55] arose from the earth and washed and
[33:58] anointed himself and changed his
[34:00] clothes, his apparel, and came into the
[34:02] house of the Lord and worshiped.
[34:05] Uh then he came to his own house. And
[34:08] when he uh required they set bread
[34:11] before him and he did eat and they
[34:14] prepared food. So he washed himself. He
[34:16] put on perfume, put on new clothes,
[34:20] went off and first thing went into the
[34:23] house of the Lord, worshiped, then went
[34:25] to his house and they prepared food and
[34:27] he ate. Verse 21. Then said his servants
[34:30] unto him, "What thing is this that thou
[34:33] hast done that thou did fast and weep
[34:36] for the child while it was alive? But
[34:38] when the child was dead, thou does rise
[34:40] and eat bread?" And he said, "While the
[34:44] child was yet alive, I fasted and wept.
[34:47] For I said, Who can tell whether God
[34:49] will be gracious to me that the child
[34:51] may live?" I love this because he's not
[34:53] demanding of God, "Lord, please make my
[34:56] child better. You have to. I'm asking
[34:59] you and you have to I've served you for
[35:01] so long. I've done this. I've done that.
[35:03] No, his his statement is I fasted.
[35:07] Who can tell whether God would be
[35:09] gracious?
[35:11] Right? He was asking if it were possible
[35:13] for God to do do this. Right? Verse 23.
[35:18] But now he is dead.
[35:20] Wherefore should I fast? Can I bring him
[35:23] back again? I shall go to him, but he
[35:25] shall not return to me.
[35:30] All right.
[35:31] So
[35:33] this is um you know David's baby is born
[35:36] to Ba Sheba becomes ill as the Lord
[35:39] prophesied because of David's adultery
[35:42] and the murder of Uriah the Hitittite.
[35:45] So when David saw how serious this
[35:47] illness was, he fell to the ground. Uh
[35:51] he never moved from there but fasted and
[35:53] prayed 7 days. Now watch that. It's a
[35:57] long fast, right? And he's doing this
[36:00] while the child is ill. And then the
[36:02] child dies. And of course, you you
[36:04] remember the servants, of course, scared
[36:06] to tell David. They eventually tell him
[36:09] uh and David uh perceiving the child
[36:12] died. Asked them, of course, and they
[36:13] told him. Then he he wakes up. He he
[36:16] rises from the ground, washes himself,
[36:18] anoints, puts some perfume, makes
[36:20] himself smell nice, uh, worships in the
[36:24] in the tabernacle, goes home, eats, and
[36:27] the servants are amazed, right? They
[36:30] expected him to have fasted when the
[36:33] child died, and they questioned him. So,
[36:36] just to just to reiterate that, I just
[36:38] want to show you this again.
[36:41] um
[36:43] to um reiterate
[36:47] what he said to them. Uh and I think
[36:49] it's just important. 1 Samuel 12 2020 20
[36:52] uh 22-23.
[36:54] While the child was yet alive, I fasted
[36:56] and wept for I said, "Who can tell
[36:59] whether God will be gracious to me?" Who
[37:02] can tell? So you analyze those words,
[37:04] it's like the Bible uses the word per
[37:08] adventure.
[37:09] So I fasted in the hope that
[37:14] God would heal the child. Why is he
[37:17] doing this? Because Nathan had already
[37:19] told him this was going to happen.
[37:22] [sighs and gasps]
[37:22] So the reason for him fasting, I mean if
[37:26] Nathan hadn't told him, he would have
[37:27] just been praying, but he kind of knew
[37:30] that this was prophecy
[37:32] and he was fasting
[37:35] to intercede on the child's behalf to
[37:39] kind of change the mind of the Lord.
[37:42] That's incredible. Verse 23, but now he
[37:45] is dead. Wherefore should I fast? So the
[37:48] servants were more like saying, "Hey,
[37:50] look, why did you give up when the child
[37:53] died? If anything, when the child died
[37:56] is the time you should be fasting, you
[37:58] know, that's more of a serious time to
[38:00] fast because you can now ask God to
[38:04] raise the child from the dead, right?"
[38:07] Okay,
[38:09] that's usually when people see more
[38:12] logic in fasting, when you're in
[38:14] desperation.
[38:16] So he was saying that if God wanted
[38:18] child to live, he would have heard him
[38:22] during the fast and healed the child. So
[38:25] he's saying there's no point fasting for
[38:29] the child to be raised from the dead
[38:30] because it was not God's will. He
[38:32] already recognized if God had taken the
[38:35] child's life that he knew what God's
[38:37] will was. This is the thing, saints.
[38:40] This shows maturity to understand the
[38:44] workings of God and to respect the ways
[38:47] of God. He knew the prophecy and yet he
[38:50] fasted hoping that God would change his
[38:53] mind. So what good did the fasting do?
[38:56] Think of this. So he's fasting for 7
[38:59] days. To his servants, they would think,
[39:01] "What a waste of time. He should have
[39:04] spent time with the child. He should
[39:06] have been at the child's bedside. He
[39:09] should have been speaking to the child,
[39:10] comforting the little baby, comforting
[39:12] the mother. Instead, he stayed there and
[39:15] the child died anyway. After 7 days, he
[39:17] wasted his time.
[39:20] All right? So, remember what we told
[39:21] you. No matter what, what is the purpose
[39:24] of the fasting? Should it should
[39:28] strengthen the believer to make him
[39:31] stronger in the faith, right?
[39:35] How did this fast benefit David?
[39:39] The fasting strengthened him for the
[39:42] child's death. So when the child died,
[39:45] he had drawn closer to God. And it was
[39:48] part of his repentance and his
[39:50] retribution for murdering Uriah the
[39:53] Hitittite. He knew it, right? He was a
[39:57] real son of God. The fasting
[39:59] strengthened him because he was closer
[40:01] to God. It strengthened him and he knew
[40:04] this is my payment. He accepted it uh
[40:07] during the fast. He regained his faith.
[40:10] It was part of his repentance. And
[40:13] though it looked like he lost the child,
[40:16] he lost the battle. He had strengthened
[40:19] his faith. He had regained his faith in
[40:22] God. So by the end, it caused David to
[40:26] remember who he was and he accepted that
[40:29] what was happening was for his own good.
[40:32] Sometimes saints, the answer you are
[40:35] going to get in your fasting is no.
[40:39] And you will only be able to accept no
[40:42] as an answer if you are a true son of
[40:45] God. All right, let's go to the
[40:48] negatives of fasting.
[40:51] Uh, and let's read a quote there.
[40:55] So the negatives of fasting,
[40:59] let's read from enticing spirits
[41:01] paragraph of 111. There's nothing in the
[41:04] word tells you to have a 40-day fast.
[41:08] Not a thing.
[41:11] Nothing in the world telling you to fast
[41:14] less God would tell you. In other words,
[41:16] unless God would tell you. So,
[41:20] um, if you're going to fast for long
[41:22] periods, God must bring it on you.
[41:24] That's what he's saying. If you fast,
[41:26] you ain't going to get hungry and go all
[41:29] these things. So, if God brings the fast
[41:30] on you, that kind of fast, you're not
[41:33] going to get hungry. You're not going to
[41:34] lose faith. You're not going to have all
[41:35] these weird things happening to you.
[41:39] After your fasting, brother, you'll be
[41:41] joy and happy all the time. Just like
[41:43] David, wash his face, wash his body,
[41:46] anoint himself, go straight to the
[41:48] temple, worship God, then go home. Sit.
[41:52] Don't appear before men like hypocrites
[41:54] do. This is Christ who said this with a
[41:56] long sad face. I'm on a 40-day fast. My
[42:00] plates won't fit me anymore. I've lost
[42:03] 30 pounds. They're They told me I look
[42:06] better after this is over. Oh, nonsense.
[42:08] It's enticing spirits of the devil.
[42:13] My
[42:14] so
[42:17] this is where the wisdom of fasting
[42:20] comes in saints. Um nowhere in the word
[42:24] does it tell you that you must go on
[42:29] long fasts, right?
[42:31] Uh and then fasting
[42:35] u if it's done the right way must not
[42:36] weaken you especially in the faith. You
[42:40] must not become uh driven by hunger
[42:45] while you are feasting on God's word.
[42:46] The the fast should produce joy and
[42:49] happiness. And when the fasting is over,
[42:53] right, uh you should be so filled with
[42:56] faith and joy and rejoicing and
[42:59] celebration before God. You must you
[43:01] must feel victorious. That's how you
[43:04] must be. You must not be like a you know
[43:07] wilted drooping flower of just depressed
[43:12] and walking around begging for
[43:14] attention.
[43:17] Please saints,
[43:19] another thing, do not fast to lose
[43:23] weight. Do not go on spiritual fast
[43:27] before God and combine that with your
[43:30] weight loss routine.
[43:33] Please don't make a mockery of God by
[43:35] doing this. That's the wrong motive. If
[43:38] you are doing intermittent fasting to
[43:40] lose weight, go and do it. Don't include
[43:43] God's word in there. All right? Don't
[43:46] combine it with God's word to make it
[43:48] spiritual. This is having an impure
[43:51] heart and God hates that. Right? Um
[43:55] let's look at another quote from the
[43:57] message the inner veil.
[44:02] Um, beautiful message and brother Ram
[44:05] says intervail.
[44:08] Christianity is not something and these
[44:11] are the these are the words of wisdom
[44:13] that I speak about so often when I'm
[44:15] preaching and you know this I just I
[44:18] just say these things to you and I know
[44:20] a lot of people think I'm making it up
[44:21] but I'm not. Right? Listen to what faith
[44:25] should be. God's not one you have to beg
[44:28] and cry and plead and watch this and
[44:32] fast and starve and everything like that
[44:36] to get to. Certainly not. Then he says,
[44:40] "I'm not degrading a fast." But watch
[44:43] what he's saying. God's not someone you
[44:45] have to do all of these like extreme
[44:48] things to get to. He says, "But here,
[44:51] not long ago, a man wrote a book on
[44:53] fasting. My women come into the meeting,
[44:57] men who went on these fast that were
[44:59] insane. They went just because the book
[45:01] said to fast 40 days, some of them with
[45:04] false plates,
[45:06] their teeth would drop out. Oh my
[45:08] goodness. And their their eyes would
[45:11] sink back and mothers to be women to be
[45:14] mothers, their little ones, as you
[45:15] understand, they would be completely, in
[45:18] other words, they would miscarry.
[45:22] They would completely go mentally out
[45:24] and be taken to the institutions. Many
[45:27] of them come in that condition. Brother
[45:29] Ram says, "I believe in fasting
[45:32] certainly, but when you fast, you don't
[45:35] hunger.
[45:37] Jesus after he had got through fasting,
[45:40] the Bible said he was hungry." God puts
[45:44] a fast on you. You don't put it on
[45:46] yourself. He certainly captured the
[45:49] woman. The man did that wrote the book
[45:52] when he said put a picture of a woman
[45:54] there. She looked 20 years younger and
[45:56] said after the fast you ought to have
[45:59] seen her then just about a year later
[46:01] what she looked like after that.
[46:04] [laughter] I think if you understand him
[46:06] he's saying after that you know speaking
[46:08] they must have blown up to you know more
[46:13] than they were before that. Certainly
[46:15] you don't do that. You don't do things
[46:18] by works. It's by grace. God in
[46:21] sovereign grace. Amen.
[46:24] So saints, we do not go on long fasts to
[46:29] plead and beg [laughter] and cry before
[46:33] God. If you do fast to inquire something
[46:36] of the Lord, it must be a short fast,
[46:38] right? Only God should put a long fast
[46:42] on you. That would be for a very strong
[46:45] reason that you would know about. It's
[46:49] not something randomly just comes upon
[46:51] you. There's a reason. There's a purpose
[46:52] to it and you will know about it.
[46:55] There's a there's a focus in you about
[46:57] that fast. You cannot and should not do
[47:00] it yourself. You may you may defeat the
[47:03] purpose of the fast. And something you
[47:05] need to realize, every person who ever
[47:08] fasted, when they came out of the fast,
[47:11] they were hit with an immediate
[47:12] temptation. They were hit with an
[47:15] immediate trial. Go and check it out
[47:16] scripturally, right? Including Christ.
[47:19] The tempter came the moment the fast had
[47:21] ended. So what I'm saying is because you
[47:24] are bodily weak, spiritually you are
[47:27] strong but mentally also weak, the first
[47:30] thing you're going to be hit with is a
[47:31] fifthdimensional
[47:33] uh challenge, right? So if you did not
[47:37] fast the proper way and you were not
[47:41] filled with the word during the duration
[47:43] of your fast, how are you going to cope
[47:46] with the fifthdimensional
[47:48] challenge?
[47:50] Our Lord was only was hungry when he was
[47:54] done fasting. But during the fast, his
[47:57] strength in the word was able to make
[47:59] him defeat the enemy when he had
[48:02] finished the fast in a time of physical
[48:05] weakness. The enemy would even tell him,
[48:07] "Turn these stones into bread."
[48:10] Right?
[48:11] Okay. So, don't fast for hidden agendas.
[48:18] Don't try long fasts unless God brings
[48:21] it upon you. Amen. Let's go to another
[48:24] quote here.
[48:28] Um,
[48:30] enticing spirits again 111a.
[48:33] Enticing spirits versing the word of
[48:35] God. Let loose. Let go. How do you do
[48:37] it, brother Brandham? Just let go.
[48:40] That's all you have to do. Take God's
[48:41] word. Don't try to work up nothing.
[48:44] Don't go down at the altar and beat and
[48:46] holler, "Lord, give me the Holy Ghost.
[48:47] Lord, give me the Holy Ghost." He ain't
[48:50] coming with you beating on the altar.
[48:52] That don't do you no good. Know that the
[48:55] way he comes, it's taking him at his
[48:58] word. Look at Peter. He says, Peter was
[49:00] in a trouble. Looked like he was going
[49:03] to die. And he seen the Lord come
[49:05] walking on the water. And he said,
[49:07] "Lord, if that be you, bid me come." And
[49:09] the Lord said, "Come on." Now, he said,
[49:12] "If Peter said, now wait a minute, Lord,
[49:16] let me go on a 40-day fast to see if I
[49:18] can walk on that water or not. Oh, Lord,
[49:20] let me go get enough spirit on me that I
[49:23] can dance in the spirit and speak in
[49:25] tongues in this boat, then I can step
[49:27] out." Of course, he's dramatizing.
[49:30] No, sir. He took God at his word, let
[49:34] loose, and let go, and God took him
[49:37] through. Amen.
[49:41] Saints, you don't fast to get faith. If
[49:46] you want to if you want to discuss
[49:48] fasting, here is a statement. Take it
[49:51] home, print it out, stick it on your
[49:55] wall.
[49:56] Don't fast to get faith. You need faith
[50:02] to fast, to become stronger in faith.
[50:07] So, if you don't have if you're weak in
[50:08] faith, don't go fasting.
[50:11] You need faith too fast. You cannot get
[50:15] humanly worked up and and expect God to
[50:18] acknowledge that. God's not going to
[50:20] acknowledge your request or your
[50:23] thoughts if the more worked up you get.
[50:26] Right? And this is what people try to do
[50:28] today. The more you jump, the more you
[50:30] shout, the more you scream, the more you
[50:32] cry, the more you do this, you really
[50:34] think God is going to be more influenced
[50:37] by human emotions?
[50:41] Obviously not. The only thing God looks
[50:43] for is faith.
[50:45] Notice long fasts of 40 days and 40
[50:47] nights without any food or water can
[50:49] only be if God comes upon you and has
[50:52] instructed you to come to him to do
[50:55] something or the other. And that will
[50:58] only happen if if you have
[51:00] [clears throat] entered into the
[51:01] atmosphere of God himself. The purpose
[51:03] of God even doing this
[51:06] making you go on a 40-day fast and you
[51:09] know will be to bring some important
[51:12] word to the church. Many people in this
[51:15] life can claim to have meditated without
[51:18] food or water for endless days. It
[51:21] doesn't mean a thing if God didn't put
[51:23] it on you. It just means you are a very
[51:25] strong willed person and you can go for
[51:28] many days without food or water. That
[51:30] doesn't mean every person can do that.
[51:33] So if you look at
[51:36] uh and I don't mean to pick on
[51:39] them this way, but if you look at the
[51:40] Muslim people who go through the Ramadan
[51:43] period,
[51:45] you know, maybe at at some time long ago
[51:48] during the time of their ancestors,
[51:50] there was some honor to it. But nowadays
[51:54] it's such a mockery. It's such a
[51:56] disgrace. I you know they fast from
[52:00] sunrise to sunset and when the sun sets
[52:05] they eat like man like they never saw
[52:09] food before. I I don't even know how
[52:11] they subject the wives to be making food
[52:14] throughout the day. I don't know how
[52:15] those wives
[52:17] not break their fast while they're
[52:19] preparing a feast for every evening.
[52:23] Right? And this is the reality. I know
[52:24] because I've got friends here who are
[52:26] Muslims. I know what they tell me. I
[52:28] know what they tell us when it comes
[52:29] time to break fast, man. They eat and
[52:32] they eat like through the night. Um and
[52:36] then I mean anybody can do that. If
[52:38] you're going to eat that much, what's
[52:39] the point? 40 days fasting. Where's the
[52:41] spirituality behind it? I don't know.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; [gasps]
[52:45] &gt;&gt; So the 40-day and 40 night fast in the
[52:48] Bible were only accomplished by three
[52:51] people and all these times it was
[52:54] supernatural. Okay, let's read some
[52:56] scripture.
[52:59] Um
[53:01] let me share this with you.
[53:06] Exodus 34:28-30.
[53:08] So you're going to see this with Moses.
[53:11] He was there with the Lord 40 days and
[53:14] 40 nights. He did neither eat bread nor
[53:16] drink water. And he wrote upon the
[53:18] tables the words of the covenant the ten
[53:20] commandments. And it came to pass when
[53:22] Moses came down from Mount Si with the
[53:24] two tables of testimony in Moses' hand
[53:27] when he came down from the mount that
[53:29] Moses whisp not that the skin of his
[53:31] face shone while he talked with him. And
[53:34] when Aaron and all the children of
[53:36] Israel saw Moses, behold the skin of his
[53:38] face shone. and they were afraid to come
[53:41] near him. Now I want you to notice,
[53:44] right? It doesn't say after 40 days, 40
[53:46] nights, this man was withered and you
[53:49] know he he was uh he looked starving. He
[53:54] came back and his his skin on his face
[53:57] was shining and he was in his holy
[53:59] atmosphere of God and the outside world
[54:02] ceased to exist to him and when he came
[54:05] out from there he was still covered by
[54:06] the pillar of fire. Uh you know so never
[54:10] seek to do this or achieve this by
[54:13] yourself.
[54:15] If you try it is a demonic attribute to
[54:18] desire that because why are you doing
[54:21] this? If you're just doing this for
[54:23] yourself, there's some other kind of
[54:25] spirit trying to convince you to do
[54:27] this. Be very, very careful. Let's go to
[54:30] Deuteronomy 9:11.
[54:34] And it came to pass at the end of 40
[54:36] days and 40 nights that the Lord gave me
[54:38] the two tables of stone, even the tables
[54:41] of the covenant. So notice God gave him
[54:44] the the commandments only at the end of
[54:46] the fast. During the fast, what was God
[54:49] doing? God was teaching him the law,
[54:52] communing with Moses, revealing the law.
[54:54] I want you to draw from this, right?
[54:56] Revealing the law to his mind. Okay? So,
[55:00] this is the first time. In verse 25,
[55:03] there's a second time he he goes in
[55:05] another 40-day fast. He says, "Thus I
[55:07] fell down before the Lord 40 days and 40
[55:09] nights as I fell down at the first
[55:12] because the Lord had said he would
[55:14] destroy you." Right? So the second fast
[55:17] was to intreat God for the people. He
[55:21] was interceding for them because God
[55:24] said he's going to destroy them. So here
[55:26] he's not even doing this for himself.
[55:28] He's doing this for the people. And this
[55:31] was like the same anointing that was on
[55:33] the savior. This was a type of Christ.
[55:36] No one should try to do this for anyone
[55:39] else. Don't do this for your wife, for
[55:41] your children, unless you are willing
[55:44] and able to lay down your life for them.
[55:48] Right? Let's go to First Kings 9:7 to8.
[55:52] And the angel of the Lord came again the
[55:53] second time and touched him and said,
[55:56] "Arise and eat because the journey is
[55:57] too great for thee." And he rose and did
[55:59] eat and drink and went in the strength
[56:01] of the meat 40 days and 40 nights unto
[56:04] Horeb, the mount of God. This is Elijah
[56:07] who was found weak in faith because Ahab
[56:10] was chasing him. The angel brought him
[56:12] strength by the word which gave him so
[56:15] much of faith that he didn't need food
[56:17] for 40 days and 40 nights. Right? So
[56:20] when the word strengthens you, you can
[56:23] fast for longer periods.
[56:26] Then look at Christ. It says Matthew
[56:29] 4:1-2.
[56:31] Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into
[56:33] the wilderness to be tempted of the
[56:35] devil. And when he had fasted 40 days
[56:37] and 40 nights, he was afterward and
[56:40] hungered. All right? So with Christ,
[56:45] the spirit put the fast upon that body
[56:50] and that the body would be tempted of
[56:52] the devil. And God knew that the body
[56:55] would be tested and the body would be
[56:58] would be found faithful in the end. If
[57:01] God knows you are going to be tempted,
[57:03] he may put a fast on you to strengthen
[57:06] you so that you would overcome because
[57:09] he knows there's a challenge coming. But
[57:12] also
[57:13] for Christ to be identified with Moses
[57:16] and Elijah because Moses and Elijah of
[57:17] the Old Testament were actually the
[57:19] types of Christ back then, right? So you
[57:22] could see uh you can see in Zechariah
[57:25] Christ is the candlestick on either side
[57:26] the two olive branches and from them the
[57:29] golden pipes that come into the the um
[57:31] the the candlestick. They are who are
[57:33] the other two witnesses Moses and Elijah
[57:36] who are the Old Testament type of Christ
[57:38] ministry. If Christ was going to be 40
[57:40] days and 40 nights in the wilderness, so
[57:43] was Moses and Elijah going to be the
[57:45] same. All right, here's more wisdom.
[57:50] Let's look at another quote here from
[57:53] the message Jesus Christ the same
[57:55] yesterday, today, and forever.
[57:59] Um, where are we?
[58:03] Here we are.
[58:06] Jesus Christ, yesterday turn for any man
[58:08] or woman that ever make real warriors in
[58:11] the kingdom of God is perfectly
[58:14] unconscious to their faith. Who? That's
[58:17] something to speak of. unconscious to
[58:19] their faith. That means you're not
[58:21] trying to work things up. You're not
[58:23] trying to think about how you just act.
[58:26] That's what it means, right? You keep
[58:29] trying to test your faith. Wonder if you
[58:31] got faith enough to do this. Have I got
[58:33] faith enough? Don't test your faith. God
[58:38] said so. Do it anyhow. God said so. Have
[58:42] you ever tested your look at these
[58:44] simple examples? Have you ever tested
[58:46] your faith whether you had enough faith
[58:48] to come to the meeting or not tonight?
[58:51] Did you test your faith to see if you
[58:52] had enough faith to eat your supper
[58:54] tonight?
[58:56] Have you ever tested? Do you think
[58:57] you'll have to fast a while and test
[58:59] your faith to see if you got enough
[59:01] faith to drive your car home? Certainly
[59:04] not. It's just automatically you believe
[59:07] it. In other words, trusting in God,
[59:10] acting upon God's word should be as easy
[59:13] as eating your supper,
[59:16] uh, driving your car to work and back.
[59:19] You don't think, you just do. That's
[59:21] what he means. You're unconscious of it
[59:24] because you believe so much in in his
[59:26] word, right? And that's the way you
[59:28] believe healing. He says, believe
[59:30] anything God said, just don't fight at
[59:32] it and shake at it and rebuke the devil
[59:34] every minute. Watch this. Don't go
[59:37] rebuke the devil. Just accept it and go
[59:40] on. See people.
[59:44] They they asking for healing
[59:46] and they go to a prayer line and they go
[59:50] in your altar calls and they ask for
[59:52] prayer and then thereafter they go away
[59:53] and they're rebuking the devil every
[59:55] minute every day. Rebuking the devil.
[59:57] Rebuke. Don't do that. Just believe.
[1:00:01] Just accept it and go on. He says that's
[1:00:03] it. There's nothing to be alarmed about.
[1:00:06] God said so. That settles it. So, we
[1:00:09] just go ahead knowing it's going to
[1:00:10] happen. Just forget about it. God said
[1:00:13] it. That proves it. I believe it. That
[1:00:14] settles it. That's all you have to do.
[1:00:17] All right. Let's read uh Psalm 69:10-12.
[1:00:24] All right. When I wept, this is this is
[1:00:27] David speaking. And chasened my soul
[1:00:29] with fasting.
[1:00:31] Chastened my soul with fasting. that was
[1:00:34] to my reproach. I made sacloth also my
[1:00:38] garment. I became a proverb to them.
[1:00:41] They that sit in the gate speak against
[1:00:44] me and I was the song of the drunkets.
[1:00:48] My all right saints
[1:00:52] in the old days
[1:00:54] people like David right who fasted
[1:00:59] um or went on fast like that would were
[1:01:02] often despised by other people could see
[1:01:06] the pain during a fast because that's
[1:01:09] what it meant in those days afflicting
[1:01:12] one's soul and they were like look at
[1:01:13] this guy's sacroth and ashes and staying
[1:01:16] away from look what he's doing to to
[1:01:18] himself. You remember what those people
[1:01:20] were doing to Job? Same thing. Look at
[1:01:22] them and they look at you with pity and
[1:01:24] oh my goodness, what a mess. What a
[1:01:27] awful sight, right? That's how people
[1:01:30] are. And he, David said, was to his own
[1:01:33] reproach. He brought it upon himself. He
[1:01:35] became a proverb to people. People
[1:01:37] started looking at him and
[1:01:38] philosophizing about him. So as time
[1:01:43] went on, the the priesthood and men who
[1:01:46] claimed to be holy made fasting
[1:01:49] fashionable
[1:01:51] uh just like it is today. You know, it's
[1:01:53] a it's a thing we are doing. We are
[1:01:54] announcing it. We are looking at the
[1:01:56] stars and the moon and the sun and this
[1:01:58] is the auspicious time and so on. Oh my
[1:02:00] goodness. It became a way of gaining
[1:02:04] high spiritual status. One would appear
[1:02:07] very holy if you were able to fast. And
[1:02:11] watch those people who claim they're
[1:02:13] going on fast. They tell everybody, they
[1:02:16] advertise it. They put it on WhatsApp
[1:02:17] groups. I'm fasting today saying pray
[1:02:19] for me and we are doing this and we're
[1:02:21] doing. Don't do that.
[1:02:25] Right? So often times it became a way of
[1:02:28] gaining high spiritual status. But
[1:02:30] sometimes Christ would even honor their
[1:02:34] fasting that they did because he he
[1:02:36] noticed their sincerity.
[1:02:39] He knew they were most likely even
[1:02:41] faking it and were just putting on a sad
[1:02:44] face to show afflicting of the soul. So
[1:02:48] Christ taught that one should never
[1:02:51] reveal the pain of fasting to eliminate
[1:02:54] hypocrisy.
[1:02:56] Right? So he's he's teaching you wisdom
[1:02:59] during your fast. Don't do these things.
[1:03:03] Right? So let's go back to Matthew
[1:03:05] chapter 6 that we read in the beginning
[1:03:06] and see what he says. Right? The the
[1:03:09] theme here is don't fast before men.
[1:03:13] What does that mean? Don't ever let them
[1:03:15] know that you are fasting. Keep it
[1:03:17] secret and always appear as if I'm
[1:03:19] absolutely fine. There's no problem
[1:03:21] here. I'm not starving. I'm not weak.
[1:03:24] I'm not going through some miserable.
[1:03:28] Keep it to yourself.
[1:03:30] When you're fasting, appear as if you
[1:03:33] are not fasting to people. [laughter]
[1:03:36] That's incredible. All right. So, I want
[1:03:39] to show this. I I want to read this
[1:03:41] again because to me, this is where the
[1:03:43] failure is among people. Moreover, he
[1:03:46] says when you fast, be not as this is
[1:03:48] Matthew 6:16-18.
[1:03:50] Be not as the hypocrites.
[1:03:53] That's a strong word of a sad
[1:03:56] countenance.
[1:03:58] Oh, praise be to God. Saints, today we
[1:04:00] are fasting. We are fasting from sunrise
[1:04:02] to sunset. Please bear us in prayer and
[1:04:05] you know uh be with us or join us uh in
[1:04:08] prayer. We're going to be praying and
[1:04:10] from 3:00 to 12:00. We're going to be
[1:04:12] doing this from 2:00 to to 3 in the
[1:04:14] afternoon. We're doing this from 5 to 6,
[1:04:17] [snorts] you know, and we're doing this
[1:04:18] for 3 days and bear us up in prayer and
[1:04:21] ask the Lord to give us strength. No.
[1:04:25] Hypocrites of a sad countenance. They
[1:04:29] disfigure their faces that they may
[1:04:32] appear unto men. They walk around with a
[1:04:35] sad countenance. This holiness, this
[1:04:37] pious look that they may appear, that
[1:04:40] men will see them that they are fasting.
[1:04:43] They are making their fasting public.
[1:04:46] Verily I say unto you, they have their
[1:04:48] reward. What does he mean? They're
[1:04:50] getting what they ask for. They're
[1:04:52] getting the attention of people. Verse
[1:04:54] 17. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint
[1:04:58] thine head. That anoint thine head. That
[1:05:01] means look bright. Anointing in those
[1:05:04] days was putting on an aroma, putting on
[1:05:07] a perfume. Wash thy face. Look fresh.
[1:05:10] Look good. Verse 18, that thou appear
[1:05:15] not unto men to fast. In other words,
[1:05:18] they mustn't even know. People mustn't
[1:05:19] even know. Only your father which is in
[1:05:22] secret. And thy father which seeth in
[1:05:24] secret shall reward thee openly.
[1:05:28] There is the secret. So
[1:05:32] um if you fast before men, you are going
[1:05:36] to get that reward because men are going
[1:05:38] to say, "Wow, look at this guy. He's
[1:05:40] fasting." and they're going to give you
[1:05:42] the attention. But if you don't do that,
[1:05:45] if you appear as if you are not fasting
[1:05:48] and only your father knows in secret, he
[1:05:53] is going to reward you openly. But if
[1:05:57] you fast openly, he's not going to
[1:05:59] reward you openly. This is a promise of
[1:06:02] scripture, right? Fasting saints is
[1:06:07] completely
[1:06:09] not what people today claim it to be.
[1:06:13] The true strength and value in fasting
[1:06:16] will be found if you don't do it before
[1:06:20] men. Follow the gospel of Christ and the
[1:06:23] prophet. Amen.
[1:06:25] So saints um fasting
[1:06:29] is about feasting on the word. In
[1:06:32] closing, this is the trial of today. We
[1:06:36] have
[1:06:38] uh we never have time to get into God's
[1:06:41] word anymore. So, I'm coming to the
[1:06:43] question the person asked me from what I
[1:06:47] said a few Sundays ago. And um so that's
[1:06:51] what I want to make clear.
[1:06:54] This is the problem. And and I'm saying
[1:06:56] this 2025. I'm speaking to you people
[1:06:59] today.
[1:07:02] I I don't care who you are. You can be
[1:07:06] people in my church, people from some
[1:07:07] other church. This is your trial today.
[1:07:11] You are too busy with natural life. You
[1:07:16] don't have time for God anymore.
[1:07:19] Uh the reason the Jewish people are
[1:07:21] still a strong people by faith is
[1:07:24] because they still keep the Sabbath.
[1:07:27] And by Sabbath I mean they lock
[1:07:28] themselves out out of the world. They
[1:07:31] switch off phones. They switch off
[1:07:32] laptops. Switch off Wi-Fi. They switch
[1:07:34] off everything. They stay away from the
[1:07:37] world. They isolate themselves for one
[1:07:40] entire day from evening of the of the
[1:07:43] Friday to evening of Saturday. They
[1:07:46] spend their time. So look, of course I
[1:07:48] know some Jewish people
[1:07:51] and a 7-day Adventist make it a
[1:07:53] hypocritical thing too because they
[1:07:55] don't do what they're supposed to do.
[1:07:58] But
[1:07:59] uh those among the Jewish people
[1:08:02] actually do the right thing. This is the
[1:08:03] reason why they are still strong in
[1:08:05] their faith. You here in 2025,
[1:08:09] you are too busy. If somebody even asks
[1:08:13] you to take time off, you wouldn't be
[1:08:17] able to. If your spouse, if your husband
[1:08:19] or your wife tells you to take a whole
[1:08:21] day off just to do something for
[1:08:25] yourself, you would say it's impossible
[1:08:29] and that you would find something to do.
[1:08:31] Oh, there's stuff to do on the car.
[1:08:32] There's stuff to fix on the house.
[1:08:34] There's stuff to do with the family.
[1:08:36] There's stuff to do with the church.
[1:08:40] You would never think about taking time
[1:08:42] to feast on the word.
[1:08:45] That's a problem. Can you even imagine I
[1:08:49] just just while we're speaking you
[1:08:52] look at your own life just just meditate
[1:08:55] right now while I'm talking on your own
[1:08:57] life on your Monday to Sunday week.
[1:09:02] Can you imagine
[1:09:05] a day where you can do nothing else but
[1:09:09] feast on the word away from all
[1:09:12] interruptions?
[1:09:14] Can you do that? Do you think it's
[1:09:16] possible?
[1:09:18] You can't. You can't anymore. That's
[1:09:22] what's missing from Christianity today
[1:09:25] is feasting on the word. All right?
[1:09:28] Abstaining from food and water just to
[1:09:30] pray a few times a day or so. In other
[1:09:33] words, you the idea of fasting today is,
[1:09:36] you know, the church gets together, we
[1:09:37] have a need coming up, let's fast on
[1:09:39] Monday.
[1:09:42] Yeah. And I tell you, they choose Monday
[1:09:45] because
[1:09:47] they eat like hogs on the weekend and
[1:09:50] they make sure the Sunday they they eat
[1:09:52] a whole lot of food. So they fast on
[1:09:54] Monday. Come on people, right? This is
[1:09:57] ridiculous. This isn't what Christianity
[1:10:00] should be. Right? So, what they tell you
[1:10:02] is on Monday, we're going to we're not
[1:10:04] going to eat food from from sun uh
[1:10:07] sunrise and uh we're going to break fast
[1:10:10] at sunset,
[1:10:12] but in between you can drink water
[1:10:14] around about 11:00 and you can drink
[1:10:17] water again at around about 2:00, just a
[1:10:19] glass of water. And we're going to pray
[1:10:22] uh every second hour and we're going to
[1:10:24] take this need up to God. There's a need
[1:10:26] for this and this. This is a
[1:10:28] denominational thing. And this is they
[1:10:31] bring it into the message, right? And
[1:10:34] more than likely,
[1:10:37] if you fast and you don't get what
[1:10:39] you're fasting for, you're not going to
[1:10:41] be like David who is strengthened and go
[1:10:44] into the house of the Lord and worship
[1:10:46] him and say, "Lord, though I didn't get
[1:10:49] what I asked for, praise be to God.
[1:10:51] Praise be to your name. I come out a
[1:10:53] stronger person." People ask me
[1:10:55] questions. Oh, you did that fast, but
[1:10:57] you didn't get what you asked for. Now,
[1:10:59] what happened? That proves your God is
[1:11:01] doesn't listen to you. What are you
[1:11:03] going to say then? Are you going to lose
[1:11:05] faith?
[1:11:06] All right. So, here's what I was talking
[1:11:09] about two Sundays ago. If you fast the
[1:11:13] right way,
[1:11:15] let your fast be about feasting on the
[1:11:19] word. That's why my title is fasting or
[1:11:21] feasting.
[1:11:23] What I was trying to say in that meeting
[1:11:25] two weeks ago is along these lines. All
[1:11:29] right. So, I want to share this with you
[1:11:33] in closing. I want to put these uh
[1:11:36] statements up uh in point form so that
[1:11:40] you can see what it's about.
[1:11:44] Okay.
[1:11:47] A true fast of faith would go like this.
[1:11:51] Number one, take a few days off from
[1:11:55] work, from family, and the entire world.
[1:12:00] That means you shutting off yourself
[1:12:04] from work, from your wife, from your
[1:12:08] children, from your mother, from your
[1:12:10] father, from everybody. Let them know
[1:12:13] those. Tell them, "I'm taking time off.
[1:12:16] I don't want to hear from anybody." Tell
[1:12:18] your wife and children, "This is a fast
[1:12:21] unto God. Don't broadcast it. I'm doing
[1:12:24] this for myself. I want to get closer to
[1:12:27] God." Number two,
[1:12:30] switch off all devices and have no
[1:12:33] contact with social media. So, I'm
[1:12:36] telling you now in 2025 what a true fast
[1:12:41] should be. If you plan to read the word
[1:12:44] on a laptop or tablet or listen to the
[1:12:47] word in audio from your phone,
[1:12:50] you must resist the urge to turn on your
[1:12:53] Wi-Fi or data. Switch it off. Switch off
[1:12:56] Wi-Fi data. Put your phone on airplane
[1:12:59] mode, your tablet on airplane mode, and
[1:13:01] you will read the message there or
[1:13:03] you're listening to uh uh a message on
[1:13:06] audio. Put the thing on airplane mode.
[1:13:10] Hear nothing from the world. Number
[1:13:14] three, deprive yourself of all luxuries
[1:13:17] and indulgences.
[1:13:19] Right? Whatever that is to you
[1:13:22] personally, all your luxuries and
[1:13:24] indulgences,
[1:13:26] deprive yourself of it. Verse four, uh
[1:13:29] sorry, number four, set a time of day
[1:13:32] where you begin your fast. In other
[1:13:34] words, have a plan. What time am I
[1:13:37] beginning my fast? What time am I
[1:13:38] ending?
[1:13:40] um where you are fasting from food and
[1:13:42] drink. Eat nutritious food before you
[1:13:44] begin and after you end. In other words,
[1:13:49] what you have now done is eliminated all
[1:13:51] distractions. Work, family,
[1:13:55] tech, social media, food, and water.
[1:13:59] You've eliminated it. You are zeroing in
[1:14:02] on feasting on God's word.
[1:14:04] And number five is what I'm going to
[1:14:06] break down into what you ought to do.
[1:14:09] Number five means use that time that you
[1:14:13] have now set out in your day
[1:14:16] for your fast to study a subject of the
[1:14:20] word that you have questions on. For
[1:14:23] example, in the case I was talking about
[1:14:26] two Sundays ago, I just mentioned this
[1:14:28] subject. What does the term Christ
[1:14:31] really mean to you personally? What does
[1:14:34] the word Christ mean to me personally?
[1:14:39] How do I study that? How do I feast on
[1:14:41] that? Right? 5.1.
[1:14:45] Study the term Christ. What is the term
[1:14:47] Christ? Go look in your concordances.
[1:14:51] Look in the message. Look at what Christ
[1:14:54] means in the Bible. Messiah. Messiah.
[1:14:57] Word made flesh. Look in study that.
[1:15:02] Spend time on that. 5.2, study the
[1:15:04] message, Christ is the mystery of God
[1:15:06] revealed. Study the seventh seal, the
[1:15:09] second coming of Christ.
[1:15:12] Uh 5.4, Read the Bible, the message. Get
[1:15:16] pages. Draw diagrams. Use pencils.
[1:15:20] Draw diagrams. Draw pictures. Take
[1:15:22] notes. Make notes.
[1:15:25] 5.5. Talk to the Lord while you study.
[1:15:29] Talk to him while you're studying.
[1:15:31] 5.6. I I I mean, don't you don't have to
[1:15:35] get down on your knees and, you know,
[1:15:37] pray like that with your hands clasped
[1:15:39] and your face looking serious. While
[1:15:41] you're studying, talk to him. Feast with
[1:15:44] the word. 5.6. Pray whenever you can. If
[1:15:48] you take a break from reading and
[1:15:50] drawing and making notes, get down on
[1:15:52] your knees and just pray for a few
[1:15:54] minutes. 5.7 Take walks in nature while
[1:15:59] thinking on your study. That means if
[1:16:01] you need a break from inside your room,
[1:16:03] wherever you are, go outside into the
[1:16:04] woods or take a hike somewhere, walk for
[1:16:07] a little while um where you're in
[1:16:10] nature. Like for example, if you have
[1:16:12] the ability to go off somewhere into the
[1:16:14] mountains or something to fast, go and
[1:16:17] do that. [clears throat]
[1:16:19] All right? That's what a feast of the
[1:16:23] word ought to be. That's what a fast
[1:16:25] should be. So a fast is not
[1:16:28] saints, it's not about uh begging God
[1:16:32] for something. It's not about laying
[1:16:35] fleeces before the Lord. It's not about
[1:16:38] desiring something and I need to commit
[1:16:40] my to show my commitment to God in
[1:16:44] prayer and in abstaining from food. No,
[1:16:47] it's about feasting.
[1:16:50] Fasting is about feasting.
[1:16:53] And this is how you should actually
[1:16:55] fast. It's a feast of the word unto the
[1:16:58] Lord. And because
[1:17:01] the the one principle is that Christ
[1:17:05] told the the tempter, man shall not live
[1:17:09] by bread alone, but by every word that
[1:17:12] proceeds out of the mouth of God. So if
[1:17:16] you are fasting,
[1:17:18] go and feast. Feast on the word. Lock
[1:17:21] yourself away. Spend time. And this is
[1:17:24] the thing brothers,
[1:17:27] husbands of homes, you are not getting a
[1:17:31] chance to spend time with the word
[1:17:33] anymore.
[1:17:34] Uh if you have cares of the world, you
[1:17:36] have a Monday to Friday job. More than
[1:17:39] likely, you're going to take and and a
[1:17:41] time where you're going to take time
[1:17:43] off,
[1:17:44] take leave. You're going to book a
[1:17:46] holiday somewhere with your family. And
[1:17:48] more than likely, you're going to book a
[1:17:49] holiday at some resort. There's going to
[1:17:51] be beaches. There's going to be swimming
[1:17:53] pools. There's going to be games to play
[1:17:55] with your children. There's going to be
[1:17:56] sightseeing, taking pictures, taking
[1:17:58] selfies.
[1:18:00] There's barely any time you're going to
[1:18:01] be spending with God. You're more than
[1:18:04] likely going to take leave. And when you
[1:18:06] take leave, you're not going to maximize
[1:18:07] it taking time to be with the word. Uh
[1:18:12] this life that the world is offering you
[1:18:16] is taking you away. distracting you.
[1:18:18] You're getting less and less time to
[1:18:20] feast in the word. And that is why
[1:18:23] husbands are failing, fathers are
[1:18:25] failing. This is why men are no longer
[1:18:28] standing with the word. This is the
[1:18:30] reason people are leaving church. This
[1:18:32] is the reason families are breaking
[1:18:34] down. Churches are breaking down is
[1:18:37] because nobody's feasting on the word
[1:18:40] anymore. You want to fast. You want to
[1:18:43] beg God for stuff. You want healing for
[1:18:46] your body. You want a better job. You
[1:18:49] want uh you want you want you want
[1:18:53] that's all you want. You you you need
[1:18:55] God to do something for you and and you
[1:18:57] believe that he's going to do it for you
[1:19:00] if you show him some commitment. And
[1:19:03] that's not what fasting is for. So, what
[1:19:05] I was saying two Sundays ago was if a
[1:19:09] modern-day man could only do this for
[1:19:13] like maybe 5 days, take some time off
[1:19:16] and feast on the word, it will elevate
[1:19:20] your consciousness to a completely
[1:19:22] different level. What I'm saying to you
[1:19:24] is if you are troubled
[1:19:28] about the seventh seal, about the coming
[1:19:29] of the Lord, if you're troubled about
[1:19:30] the open book, if you're troubled about
[1:19:32] your understanding with God's word, if
[1:19:34] you if you hear somebody preaching and
[1:19:36] you're a little disoriented or
[1:19:39] something, you're you're discouraged by
[1:19:41] something you heard, why not feast on
[1:19:44] the word? Why not go to God, do the
[1:19:47] right thing? Why not go on a feast,
[1:19:50] which is a fast? Separate yourself from
[1:19:52] the word. It's called consecration.
[1:19:55] That's what consecration is. Set
[1:19:58] yourself apart from the word, from the
[1:20:00] world. Give yourself over to the word of
[1:20:02] God. Read everything. You should by now
[1:20:05] know if you're looking for a specific
[1:20:07] subject. If you want to talk about the
[1:20:08] seventh seal, there's a message called
[1:20:10] the seven seal. There is the breach
[1:20:12] message. There is souls in prison. Now,
[1:20:15] there is Christ the mystery of God
[1:20:16] revealed. I know there are brothers who
[1:20:18] messaged me and said, "Brother brother
[1:20:20] Al, I want to I want to study the
[1:20:22] seventh seal. Which which messages do I
[1:20:24] study? Where do I look to understand the
[1:20:27] rapture, the coming of the Lord, this
[1:20:29] the the seven seal? Can you give me a
[1:20:30] list of books?" So So I did. And uh and
[1:20:33] I know it's it's helped some of them,
[1:20:35] those who who want to study the word. So
[1:20:39] that's what fasting is about, saints.
[1:20:41] And I trust that this will give you uh
[1:20:45] strength. It'll give you some wisdom,
[1:20:46] some understanding. Don't go and do
[1:20:48] crazy things that's going to hurt your
[1:20:50] body, hurt you mentally. And I've given
[1:20:53] you all these quotes from the prophet to
[1:20:56] tell you the dangers of doing things the
[1:20:59] wrong way. Uh so I trust that this will
[1:21:03] give you enough wisdom to handle this
[1:21:05] correctly. The Lord bless you and I want
[1:21:07] to thank those who've asked me the
[1:21:09] question. I think it was necessary for
[1:21:12] us to do this today and I trust that the
[1:21:14] Lord will bless you abundantly. God be
[1:21:16] with you until we meet again. Amen.
