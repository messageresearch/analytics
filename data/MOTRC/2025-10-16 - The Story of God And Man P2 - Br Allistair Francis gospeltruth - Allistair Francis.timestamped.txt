[0:02] Let's read the word of God. Job 38:1-7.
[0:07] Then the Lord answered Job out of the
[0:10] whirlwind and said, "Who is this that
[0:14] darkeneth counsel by words without
[0:17] knowledge?
[0:18] G up now thy loins like a man, for I
[0:22] will demand of thee, and answer thee.
[0:25] Where was thou when I laid the
[0:27] foundations of the earth? Declare if
[0:31] thou hast understanding.
[0:33] Who had laid
[0:36] um the measures thereof? If thou
[0:39] knowest, or who had stretched the line
[0:41] upon it? Whereupon are the foundations
[0:45] thereof farened? Or who laid the
[0:48] cornerstone thereof? And we want to take
[0:51] our title and text from verse 7. when
[0:54] the morning stars sang together and all
[0:58] the sons of God shouted for joy.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; The Lord blessed the reading of his
[1:02] word. You may be seated.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this morning um we want to we
[1:10] want to speak on um the story of God and
[1:15] man part two and our the theme of it is
[1:18] going to be becoming sons of God.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. becoming sons of God. This is
[1:25] something that is so casually spoken of.
[1:29] And um I don't think the the weight of
[1:33] what this understanding really is has
[1:36] has grasped people.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; But I think when you when you get
[1:40] through the the opening of the seventh
[1:42] seal, when you understand the opening of
[1:44] the word, then it becomes clearer to us.
[1:47] Amen. So our title is going to be
[1:51] morning stars sang together and sons of
[1:54] God shouted for joy. Amen. Morning stars
[1:58] sing together and sons of God shouted
[2:01] for joy. Now the prophet quotes this
[2:04] scripture often to tell the story of a
[2:06] very old African-American preacher who
[2:10] he had heard preaching and he spoke
[2:12] about you know when the prophet was a
[2:14] young minister and he was visiting
[2:17] different churches and he was trying to
[2:19] figure himself out and where it was
[2:21] going to be what it was going to or what
[2:23] his ministry was and he come across this
[2:25] this Pentecostal church and he said um
[2:28] he sees this old um negro little man. He
[2:32] looked like about 18 years old. 80 years
[2:34] old. And he look like he's, you know,
[2:36] walking up to the pulpit and a platform
[2:39] and he looks like there's barely any
[2:40] life left in him. And and and brother
[2:44] Ram is thinking what's going to happen
[2:45] to this guy, you know. And then he reads
[2:47] the scripture and uh and then brother
[2:51] Ram said he he he speaks about Job and
[2:53] then he he goes to eternity. Brother
[2:55] Ram's words. goes to eternity all the
[2:57] way through eternity and takes the
[2:59] horizontal rainbow and comes back to his
[3:02] time to the second coming of the Lord.
[3:04] And then he was so excited. This
[3:06] 80-year-old man was moving up and down
[3:08] and jumping and preaching. Brother Bham
[3:10] quotes his word. He said, "You ain't got
[3:12] enough room in here for me to preach."
[3:15] &gt;&gt; So, and then brother Bam looked at his
[3:17] says, "I want that."
[3:20] So his comments, now if you look at this
[3:23] through the message, morning stars sang
[3:26] together and sons of God shouted for
[3:28] joy. Every time you hear this in the
[3:31] message, brother Benam is talking about
[3:34] this situation, right? Most of the time
[3:38] he's talking about that story of that
[3:40] old man preaching. And then his comments
[3:42] begin to evolve in his ministry from
[3:46] that story to
[3:49] people saying well you know this new
[3:51] kind of worship let's you know this
[3:54] message people or the Pentecostal people
[3:56] it's a new kind of worship and brother
[3:57] Bam use that and says no it's not a new
[3:59] kind of worship it's a worship that
[4:01] began before time.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh then that evolved and then
[4:07] he spoke about them how they must have
[4:10] shouted for joy when they saw the lamb
[4:12] slain in him before the foundation of
[4:15] the world. And then it went on and he
[4:17] said they uh the shouting religion must
[4:20] have happened when they saw that lamb
[4:21] slain. And then they uh it evolved again
[4:24] and he said they must have seen the
[4:26] savior redeeming mankind. That's why
[4:29] they were rejoicing. when they seen
[4:31] their names put on the book later on in
[4:33] his ministry. They were shouting when
[4:35] they seen the names being put on the
[4:37] book.
[4:38] &gt;&gt; And then in Christ, the mystery of God
[4:40] revealed that beautiful message. He says
[4:44] God had a hidden purpose, a hidden
[4:46] mystery. Uh in his uh and he says in
[4:50] spiritual amnesia, he says I was with
[4:53] him in the immortal realms of God 10
[4:57] million years before. I was, he said, so
[5:00] I was with him before the beginning. He
[5:03] said, I was with him when he was when he
[5:05] met Abraham. I was with him when he met
[5:08] Jacob. I was with him when he met
[5:10] Joseph. I was with him when he met
[5:12] Moses. I was with him with every
[5:14] Christian.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; You just have amnesia.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; And he every time those statements were
[5:24] made that I've just mentioned, he quotes
[5:26] the scripture.
[5:28] Morning stars sang together and sons of
[5:32] God shouted for joy.
[5:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. So we want to speak on that this
[5:37] morning and bring it back to the story
[5:39] of God and man. And the theme is
[5:42] becoming sons.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Becoming the sons of God. Amen. So I
[5:47] want to begin with reading some just
[5:49] some quotes to give us a little um
[5:52] beginning. And any man knows that the
[5:55] angel of the covenant was Jesus Christ.
[5:57] That's right. The same yesterday, today,
[5:59] and forever. God unfolded himself. Now,
[6:02] I want you to remember what we spoke on
[6:04] last week. The whole plan of redemption,
[6:07] the whole from from the beginning before
[6:10] the beginning of beginnings, right? From
[6:12] the fountain of life to the logos to
[6:15] creating angels to creating the the the
[6:17] universe to creating man, uh the fall to
[6:21] Christ. Think of everything. remember
[6:23] everything. So remember God unfolded
[6:26] himself. That was God in that pillar of
[6:29] fire. Remember that fountain of seven
[6:31] colors. He unfolded himself down. Now
[6:34] he's moving through time
[6:36] &gt;&gt; into a human body,
[6:39] virgin born. So that fountain of life,
[6:43] that pillar of fire,
[6:45] moving through time, unfolded himself
[6:47] down now to Christ, born of a virgin,
[6:50] right? No man could touch him there
[6:54] in the fountain of seven colors. You
[6:57] could see him here, but he's born of a
[7:00] virgin. He's virgin born. Now he went
[7:02] away. Who's that? The one who was born
[7:04] of a virgin. He went away. A little
[7:06] while the world see me no more. Yet I'll
[7:08] be with you even in you. Same God
[7:13] living right down unfolding himself into
[7:16] the heart of man. got down here when he
[7:19] could shake them are rejoicing like Job
[7:22] did.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; They said, "Brother Brandon, that's a
[7:26] new kind of religion." Uh-uh. It's just
[7:29] a new case of the old time.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Old time. Why? God said, "Uh, ask Job,
[7:35] where was you when I laid the foundation
[7:36] of the world?" When the morning stars
[7:38] sang together and the sons of God
[7:39] shouted for joy. Watch this. Did I?
[7:45] before the foundation of the world was
[7:48] ever laid. This ain't something new.
[7:51] It's something old.
[7:54] It's the beginning.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's read. The hand
[7:59] of the Lord came upon him. Why I said
[8:02] about God spoke to Job one day and he
[8:04] said, Job, where was you when I laid the
[8:08] foundations of the world? Tell me what
[8:11] they're fostened unto. said, "When the
[8:14] morning stars sang together and sons of
[8:16] God shouted for joy, a hundred million
[8:20] years before the world was ever formed,
[8:22] they had shouting religion."
[8:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then talk about something new.
[8:28] Why? It's the oldest there is and the
[8:31] only kind there really is. Yeah. It's
[8:34] oldfashioned heartfelt I love this. It's
[8:37] oldfashioned heartfelt sky blue
[8:40] sinkilling religion.
[8:42] Brother, it don't whitewash you. It
[8:45] washes you white from inside out.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. Here it is. Makes you do
[8:51] things you didn't think you ever would
[8:54] do.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; That's where we are today. Listen, he
[9:00] said in my right mind, in my better
[9:04] thinking or something like that, I would
[9:06] have been a hunter and a fisherman.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; I would not be doing this. But it's I'm
[9:11] paraphrasing it. But he called me to do
[9:14] this.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[9:15] &gt;&gt; And I know every single one of you here
[9:18] in your thinking I can't say better
[9:22] thinking in your your thinking you would
[9:25] rather be somewhere else doing something
[9:27] else.
[9:29] It's the word of God to human beings is
[9:32] inconvenient.
[9:34] &gt;&gt; It messes up your plans
[9:37] &gt;&gt; every time. And and you know this
[9:39] because you always have desires to do
[9:41] something and the word of God blocks you
[9:43] &gt;&gt; and you won't do it for the word's sake,
[9:46] not your sake,
[9:47] &gt;&gt; for the word's sake. But you fully know
[9:49] you have the ability, the capability,
[9:51] and the desire to do that. But you won't
[9:54] do it because your heart is sold out to
[9:57] the word.
[9:59] &gt;&gt; And therefore, the word is inconvenient
[10:01] to your desire and your will.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; That's a struggle you have every day.
[10:07] Now, I love these statements that the
[10:08] prophet makes and so many others like in
[10:10] the message I just read too. It really
[10:13] makes my soul soar higher and higher
[10:16] when I get into the word. Now, many
[10:18] years ago, I just want to say this,
[10:21] brother Isaiah Brooks was traveling
[10:23] through South Africa with a minister I
[10:25] had never met before. His name was
[10:26] Brother John Simon. And uh I I obviously
[10:30] um we had we had heard brother Isaiah
[10:33] was coming and you know brother Isaiah
[10:36] pitched up and he had this other
[10:37] minister with him. So we thought brother
[10:39] Isaiah was going to preach and brother
[10:41] Isaiah said no please let brother John
[10:43] preach. So we said okay you know and
[10:45] brother we took him to Peter Marrisburg
[10:47] at that time. It was a Thursday evening
[10:50] and uh I was nervous because this is a
[10:52] church we were helping out and I'm
[10:54] thinking I don't know this brother and
[10:55] but brother Isaiah had you know um said
[10:58] he he should preach. So you know here we
[11:01] go. you have no idea what ministers have
[11:03] to go through and the nervousness,
[11:05] right? And then uh he he he read the
[11:09] scripture, this opening scripture about
[11:12] the sons of God shouting for joy. And um
[11:16] from the opening scripture, he then made
[11:20] or asked the most profound question I
[11:24] had heard and it has never left my mind
[11:27] to this day. In fact, I've quoted it
[11:29] many times. just never said it was from
[11:31] brother John Simon. And um but you know
[11:35] I'd love to give roses while we're
[11:37] living.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; And uh so when he made this the
[11:42] statement this question it was a
[11:44] question but it was more a statement and
[11:46] uh it made my mind race till till today
[11:50] for many reasons that you that you could
[11:52] not imagine but I hope to express some
[11:54] of it today. He simply asked this. If
[11:57] sons of God shouted for joy when they
[12:01] were in attribute form, why wouldn't
[12:04] they do the same in manifested form?
[12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; That was his opening question and a
[12:11] statement. And I tell you, I struggled
[12:13] to concentrate for the rest of the
[12:15] service because he had my mind going.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; And the service went on. It was a
[12:20] wonderful service. It was a beautiful
[12:22] service. But what I drove back from
[12:24] Pashburg that night to Durban and then
[12:26] we were talking with them in the car but
[12:28] in my mind it's just cog wheels just
[12:30] working and uh the whole thing was
[12:33] unfolding to me and I my heart is just
[12:36] saying amen.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; If they shouted for joy in attribute
[12:40] form there's a great big thing I need to
[12:43] see here that in manifested form they're
[12:47] not going to be dispersed.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; They're not going to be lost somewhere
[12:50] out in the world. Those attributes are
[12:52] going to find themselves.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; They're going to be drawn together.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; If they shouted together in attribute
[12:59] form, in manifested form, they've got to
[13:02] do the same.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; So, I want to continue on the story of
[13:08] the story, the subject of the story of
[13:10] God, a man, but I want to draw us into
[13:13] this beautiful scripture from Job
[13:15] 38:1-7. And I like the question brother
[13:19] Vanam asked in spiritual amnesia and u
[13:22] he speaks about the promise uh or or
[13:25] rather the premise of the point. The
[13:29] premise of the point God asking Job was
[13:33] where were you
[13:37] &gt;&gt; speak tell me understanding. Who is this
[13:40] that is darkening counsel with words
[13:42] without understanding? That was the
[13:44] beginning question, right? Like who is
[13:47] who is giving you spiritual amnesia? Who
[13:49] is telling you stuff about me when
[13:52] they've got no knowledge about who I am?
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Who is telling you things about the
[13:56] word, about the message or giving you
[13:58] philosophy about who I am or with words
[14:02] they don't have understanding of? Who is
[14:05] it? Job. Where were you? That's the
[14:09] premise. So I'm asking you, where were
[14:12] you? When the morning stars sang
[14:15] together and the sons of God shouted for
[14:18] joy,
[14:20] &gt;&gt; he says, "You forgot where you came
[14:22] from." Brother Vam says, "Spiritual
[14:25] amnesia."
[14:26] You have spiritual amnesia. All right.
[14:29] So, let's go to the next point.
[14:31] The attributes
[14:33] um then and now, right? So, the first
[14:37] thing is that attributes of God don't
[14:40] just occur by themselves. isolated in
[14:44] time. They're not just acting alone.
[14:46] There's not just a son of God just
[14:48] pitching up somewhere and
[14:51] randomly.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; There's no random thing about this.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; There what I'm saying to I want to draw
[14:58] your attention to this. There are always
[15:01] clusters.
[15:03] You remember like how he took a clinker
[15:06] off that original light through it
[15:09] &gt;&gt; and there were clusters that formed a
[15:11] galaxy. Yes.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; Right. There are clusters of these
[15:16] attributes and uh they were meant for
[15:19] each time. There were clusters around
[15:22] Martin Luther's time.
[15:24] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[15:24] &gt;&gt; there were clusters of attributes that
[15:26] were thrown into that time around John
[15:28] Wesley around Ireneius around there were
[15:31] clusters of attributes they would find
[15:33] themselves.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Right. and they would gather around the
[15:38] world for their day and they would work
[15:41] together for a common purpose. You would
[15:44] not find clusters attracted to each
[15:47] other and then working against each
[15:48] other.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right. Amen.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; That's not what they did in the
[15:52] beginning.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; So why? Because they have one mind.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; They were in his mind. They came from
[16:01] the same cluster of attributes so to
[16:04] speak. Amen. That means there were
[16:07] attributes that came together in
[16:09] Abraham's time.
[16:12] Like you wouldn't have a purpose of
[16:15] Abraham being fulfilled if there wasn't
[16:17] an Elea there.
[16:20] &gt;&gt; If there wasn't a Sarah there.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't Abraham would not be able
[16:25] to fulfill his full potential without
[16:28] Sarah. Without Eleaza.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. There wouldn't be a a a story of
[16:34] Moses if there was no Joshua. If there
[16:37] was no Aaron, if there was no Zipper.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; There had to be clusters of attributes
[16:43] &gt;&gt; that were of the same mind.
[16:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; That were of the same purpose
[16:48] &gt;&gt; to be fulfilled in a time to bring forth
[16:51] a particular purpose in that time. And
[16:54] they would work together with each other
[16:56] like Zipper would challenge that husband
[16:59] and say, "A bloodier husband art thou to
[17:01] me."
[17:02] &gt;&gt; But she saved him. God would have killed
[17:05] him if it weren't for her.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; And that attribute had to be fulfilled
[17:09] to keep that man alive to fulfill the
[17:11] bigger purpose.
[17:13] &gt;&gt; But there are always these clusters.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Right? So how about this time?
[17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. There are a few things we have to
[17:23] consider and this is what's going to
[17:24] happen saints. There are a lot of people
[17:26] who are going to want to be a part of
[17:27] the cluster.
[17:30] We have a purpose. We have one mind
[17:34] and we have something to fulfill. There
[17:37] are people who are going to try to think
[17:39] they can do what we are supposed to do a
[17:42] better way, a different way. But if they
[17:45] work against what God has ordered,
[17:49] &gt;&gt; it isn't going to work. Yeah.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Because we have to be able to shout
[17:54] together for joy.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; So number one, who are the morning
[17:59] stars?
[18:01] Why do they sing? Who are the sons of
[18:04] God? Why do they shout for joy?
[18:09] Now I want I want to tell you something.
[18:13] When you read the Bible and and here's
[18:16] what's happened since Western filled the
[18:18] earth is that everything is like
[18:20] fantasy.
[18:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Like science fiction. And and when when
[18:25] you hear nominal Christians today when
[18:28] they sing when they talk about the
[18:29] father, they talk about the son, they
[18:31] talk about angels, they sing in the
[18:34] prophetic,
[18:36] &gt;&gt; they pray in the prophetic.
[18:39] I I don't know. Everyone prays in the
[18:41] prophetic.
[18:43] Speak. If you if you meet them, say,
[18:44] "God bless you, brother. How you doing?"
[18:46] And, "Oh, which church you from?" And,
[18:48] "Oh, I'm a I'm I'm a pastor, but I I
[18:50] pray in the prophetic." Oh, okay. That's
[18:53] good for you. Bit risky, but you know,
[18:57] whatever floats your boat.
[19:00] Who are the sons of God? Who are the
[19:02] morning stars? And who are the sons of
[19:04] God? This has been questions that have
[19:08] plagued the minds of people for hundreds
[19:10] of years, right? And and the questions
[19:14] on who are the sons of God. This is you
[19:17] know what I love about mysteries that
[19:19] confuse people
[19:22] is that I know it's meant for me.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; The more trouble there is around it, the
[19:29] more it's meant for me. Yeah.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[19:32] &gt;&gt; So if people were arguing about the sons
[19:35] of God from Genesis saying they were
[19:36] angels and they pressed themselves into
[19:38] human beings and they make up stories
[19:40] and the nephilim and this mated with
[19:42] that creature and this produced this and
[19:44] I know that is meant for me to know and
[19:47] nobody else.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, when they talk about Christ
[19:50] and they talk about the bodies and they
[19:52] talk about the resurrection and they
[19:53] make up stories and they make up uh
[19:55] fantasy about rapture and flying off in
[19:58] the sky and all that's when I know this
[20:01] is meant for me
[20:02] &gt;&gt; because that mystery is going to go on
[20:05] with people forever.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; But we are going to break into the
[20:08] reality of it.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Not afraid of it. Amen.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; So, some have said, brother Miam even
[20:15] speaks about in the message that there
[20:17] are people who said those sons of God
[20:20] are angels. But that isn't consistent
[20:24] with scripture.
[20:26] So, let's begin.
[20:29] Morning stars.
[20:31] First, who are morning stars? You
[20:33] remember this from last week, my
[20:35] terrible drawing. These morning stars
[20:39] are angels.
[20:41] Morning stars is a designation which
[20:44] means angels.
[20:46] The Bible is consistent from Genesis to
[20:49] Revelation that stars when referred to
[20:53] as heavenly beings are angels.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Revelation 1, seven stars in his right
[20:59] hand. Who are they? Angels. Messengers.
[21:03] &gt;&gt; Yes. They were manifested in man but
[21:07] they are angels.
[21:09] Stars are messengers. Right? Jude verse
[21:12] 13 when it refers to the fallen angels.
[21:15] Remember Jude is talking about the
[21:16] fallen angels. He called them wondering
[21:19] stars.
[21:21] Um it's a special designation
[21:26] which means being a messenger, a
[21:28] messenger from God to mankind. And the
[21:31] prophet said you can have heavenly
[21:33] angels and earthly angels.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; They are messengers.
[21:38] The word morning star refers to angels
[21:43] from the beginning.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Sunday school children.
[21:49] What does morning mean? From the
[21:52] beginning.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Evening time is the end time. The
[21:56] morning time was the beginning time.
[21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So these stars, morning stars, are
[22:02] angels from the beginning. Are you with
[22:05] us?
[22:05] &gt;&gt; If you read Isaiah 14 and verse 12,
[22:09] here's an interesting one. How art thou
[22:11] fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of
[22:15] the morning?
[22:16] &gt;&gt; How art thou cut down to the ground? We
[22:17] read this last week. This is why the
[22:20] Jews named him Lucifer. What does
[22:24] Lucifer mean? Lightbringer
[22:28] or morning star
[22:31] Lucifer actually I mean you could
[22:32] actually call the whole group Lucifer.
[22:35] Of course, we don't because now it's
[22:37] evolved into the devil.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; But it simply means lightgiver or
[22:41] morning star, right? So he is old
[22:45] Lucifer, morning star, son of the
[22:48] morning. In other words, angel from the
[22:51] beginning,
[22:53] right? And that's referring to Satan or
[22:57] the devil as we now call him. Of course,
[23:00] those are not names. Satan means
[23:03] adversary.
[23:05] Devil means false accuser.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:07] &gt;&gt; Right. So there's no reason for us to
[23:10] give him fancy names.
[23:13] Now let's consider what God is asking
[23:15] Job. Okay. Where were you before the
[23:20] beginning of the creation of the earth
[23:22] and the beginning of fleshly man? Tell
[23:25] me if you know.
[23:28] Where were you? So we know the setting
[23:32] is in the first beginning when that
[23:34] logos created the angels. That's the
[23:37] setting. Where were you then?
[23:40] Right? Why did they sing in the
[23:42] beginning? So that's our first two
[23:44] questions. Who were the morning stars?
[23:46] Why do they sing? Okay. So in Job 38:7
[23:50] when we see uh the word sing, the
[23:54] morning stars sang for joy. That word
[23:57] sang in the Hebrew is raan which means
[24:02] to overcome.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; Now the reason it is that way in the
[24:09] Hebrew is because like today we just
[24:13] sing.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; We sing because we're happy.
[24:19] We sing because it's tradition
[24:22] to sing in church and do song specials
[24:26] and it's entertaining and it sounds nice
[24:28] on the ear.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; But in the Hebrew time, you only sang
[24:33] when a battle was won.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; Singing speaks of victory.
[24:41] &gt;&gt; When the Israelites saw God vanquish the
[24:43] Egyptians in the sea, they came out with
[24:45] temporal singing. The horse and his
[24:48] rider hath me cast into the sea. I will
[24:50] sing to the Lord forever
[24:52] &gt;&gt; because he has cast Pharaoh's riders and
[24:55] chariots into the sea. It was a victory.
[24:58] In Revelations 5, when the lamb took the
[25:00] book, they sang a new song. It was a
[25:03] victory. Why? Because no man was worthy
[25:05] to take the book.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; In Revelations 14, when the 144,000
[25:09] gained the victory. Revelation 14:1,
[25:12] they sing a song which they hear from
[25:14] heaven which only the 144,000 can learn.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[25:19] &gt;&gt; Morning stars sang
[25:22] because they overcame Lucifer and his
[25:25] angels and kicked them out of heaven.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; Why did morning stars sing?
[25:31] It wasn't the angels breaking out into
[25:33] choir.
[25:36] There was a reason. That's why brother
[25:37] Bam kept putting they must have seen
[25:40] something. They must have something must
[25:42] have happened. They must have seen uh
[25:44] the lamb slain before the foundation of
[25:45] the world. They must have seen names
[25:47] being put in the book.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; He spoke about them differently, right?
[25:50] They sang and they shouted. One group
[25:52] sang, the other group shouted.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. So then we get to the sons of God.
[26:00] Now the sons of God is another
[26:04] designation altogether.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Now wait, this is where you're going to
[26:08] wake up. Sons of God are not morning
[26:12] stars.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; Sons of God is a special designation.
[26:19] That's why those sons of God in the time
[26:23] of Genesis before the flood were not
[26:25] fallen angels.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; The sons of God, brother Mariam dispels
[26:29] that.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Said they are not fallen angels. They
[26:32] were the children of Adam.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; That took the sons of Cain.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; And produced hybrid through that. Amen.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Right. So who are sons of God? They are
[26:42] the children of God.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:45] &gt;&gt; So before the flood there was this
[26:47] conjecture that the sons of God took the
[26:49] daughters of men and people thought they
[26:51] were fallen angels but the prophet said
[26:53] they were not. Sons of God are a
[26:56] designation
[26:57] of man.
[27:00] &gt;&gt; In the Hebrew sons of God,
[27:05] son is Ben.
[27:07] God is Elohim.
[27:09] Ben Elohim,
[27:12] sons of God, sons of the self-existing
[27:14] one.
[27:16] Ben Elohim in Hebrew means
[27:20] divine being,
[27:23] divine one or divine judge,
[27:30] &gt;&gt; not angels.
[27:33] Yes, angels might be divine, whatever
[27:35] that means,
[27:36] right? Maybe to you divine means
[27:39] something from heaven that's shiny and
[27:41] glowing.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; I don't think so.
[27:45] Divine wants, divine beings or divine
[27:48] judges. The word Elohim is plural
[27:53] for Eli. Elo, remember that?
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Brother speaks of that. That's in the
[27:58] Hebrew. Elo,
[28:00] right? That's the singular. Elohim is
[28:03] the plural. Elohim actually means gods.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Remember in the commandments
[28:11] uh thou shalt
[28:14] I am the Lord thy God. You shall have no
[28:17] other gods beside me. In the Hebrew that
[28:20] says I am your Elohim. You shall have no
[28:23] other Elohims or Elohim besides me. The
[28:27] same God that is used, the same name
[28:29] Elohim that is used for God is the same
[28:32] name that was used for the idols.
[28:35] &gt;&gt; He said they are false Elohim.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[28:39] &gt;&gt; I am Elohim. If it was his name, literal
[28:43] name, how can he call an idol Elohim? It
[28:46] was a Canaanitish word that Abraham
[28:48] learned at the time.
[28:51] Ben Elohim is sons of God, divine ones.
[28:57] But more than anything, they are judges.
[29:02] Remember when the Lord said when when
[29:04] they um came to Christ and they said,
[29:06] "You being a man call yourself God." He
[29:08] said, "What's your problem? Doesn't the
[29:09] scripture say you are gods?"
[29:12] &gt;&gt; What was he asking now? Doesn't the
[29:14] scripture say you are judges?
[29:17] &gt;&gt; What What problem do you have with me
[29:19] saying I am a judge? I am the judge.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; By implication, it would mean that sons
[29:28] of God are the offspring of God.
[29:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; And that would mean they are the
[29:34] offspring of the divine one. They are
[29:37] divine ones. They are divine beings.
[29:39] They are divine judges. That is the
[29:41] reason they had a problem with Christ
[29:43] calling himself the son of God. Listen
[29:46] people, Christ actually didn't call
[29:49] himself the son of God. He went around
[29:51] saying son of man, son of man. Even when
[29:54] Nathaniel called him son of David, that
[29:56] was Nathaniel's revelation. Christ never
[29:58] went out saying the son of God shall be
[30:01] lifted up. He said the son of man.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; When you see the son of man, he because
[30:05] it was son of man dispensation. But when
[30:07] he called himself son of man, they knew
[30:11] what that meant.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; When he said the son of man, they knew
[30:16] he meant I am Messiah, son of God. It's
[30:20] only today in 2025 that you have a
[30:22] problem because you don't understand the
[30:24] wording of that time. Son of man was son
[30:28] of God the Messiah.
[30:30] &gt;&gt; They understood that. That's why they
[30:32] said you being a man make yourself God.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; All right. So you all got it?
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Angels
[30:42] were not sons.
[30:45] &gt;&gt; Sunday school.
[30:47] Angels were not sons. They were angels.
[30:50] Sons are sons. Angels are angels. Let's
[30:52] understand that. All right, let's read.
[30:57] Remember this fountain of life. There's
[30:59] all the little dots, the little
[31:01] attributes. And brother said, out of him
[31:04] came this logos.
[31:06] King's Theophony. God formed himself
[31:10] into the form of a man. Remember from
[31:12] last week? Because he could see what man
[31:15] was going to be. He made himself into a
[31:18] form relatable to the ones who are going
[31:20] to be.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; He chose the form of a man in theophony.
[31:25] &gt;&gt; That's why theophony looks like man.
[31:28] Why? Because of who you are today.
[31:32] Okay. Anyway, so
[31:35] where were you?
[31:38] Can you see the the clusters coming
[31:41] together into an order in him?
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. When all the attributes were in the
[31:46] fountain, they were just attributes.
[31:50] But when they became the logos, the word
[31:53] king theophony, they became an order to
[31:56] those attributes.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; They came together in their clusters, in
[32:00] their purposes. In him, there was going
[32:03] to be an Abraham. And there were going
[32:05] to be attributes around Abraham. There
[32:08] were going to be a David. There was
[32:10] going to be a Samuel. There was going to
[32:11] be uh an Ezekiel, a Daniel. There was
[32:15] going to be a Paul and a and a Peter and
[32:17] around them were going to be attributes
[32:19] and those attributes were all in him.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; All right. So, here's the quote.
[32:26] All right. That's where sons of God
[32:28] were. Sons of God were there before
[32:31] angels.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; They were there in attribute form.
[32:36] Right?
[32:37] Here's quote.
[32:39] Brother man was praying said and you
[32:41] created angels
[32:44] then you become a god.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; So when did he become God? When there
[32:49] was a creation to worship him.
[32:52] Before that he wasn't God. He was the
[32:55] fountain of life. The self-existing one.
[32:57] I am. I am becoming. Is that right? But
[33:02] when he created angels he become a god
[33:07] an object of worship. And then from
[33:09] there you created man and so forth. Man
[33:12] fell the great attribute of God displays
[33:14] itself tonight as a savior. When you
[33:16] created man, you become a father.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; So when did he become a father? When
[33:24] Adam was created. He's not the father
[33:27] because he's the father of Jesus.
[33:30] He's the father because he's the creator
[33:32] of man. Yes.
[33:34] &gt;&gt; He became the designation of father
[33:36] becomes manifested when man is created.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Because so who does a father why is a
[33:44] father called a father?
[33:47] Go ahead Sunday school.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Because he has.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; So why wasn't the father when the angels
[33:54] were created?
[33:58] &gt;&gt; Because the angels were not sons. Yes.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; They were messengers to sons.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; He becomes father when he has sons. You
[34:08] cannot be called father unless you have
[34:10] children.
[34:13] Can you imagine married couple and you
[34:17] know how it goes married people
[34:20] you know first you're
[34:23] love darling whatever 20 years later
[34:26] you're dad
[34:29] right your wife calls you dad what's
[34:31] your problem
[34:33] you know I used to be my name now you
[34:36] call me dad I'm not your dad but that's
[34:38] what you become you become Dad, everyone
[34:41] calls you dad,
[34:43] you know, and very much among our our
[34:47] Indian people, you can go to
[34:48] Chhatzsworth, Phoenix, anywhere here in
[34:50] Durban, you meet a stranger, he'll call
[34:52] you dad.
[34:58] Say, "Hey, I'm looking for this road."
[35:00] "Hey, dad, I can help you."
[35:06] father. You can only be father if you
[35:10] have sons.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; If you have children. Amen. When you
[35:15] create a man, you become a father.
[35:18] Praise be to God. He also said in
[35:20] another place,
[35:22] we could never enjoy an angel's life.
[35:28] &gt;&gt; Some of you wish, right?
[35:31] &gt;&gt; You never enjoy an angel's life. He said
[35:33] we wasn't created angels. God created
[35:36] angels, but he created you and I, men
[35:39] and women.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up, saints. He says
[35:42] this in many different places, in
[35:44] different ways. There's a difference
[35:46] between morning stars and sons of God.
[35:48] Difference between angels and sons of
[35:50] God. So, angels
[35:53] could fall and be lost and thrown into a
[35:57] lake of fire.
[36:00] offspring or sons can be lost and not be
[36:05] thrown into a lake of fire because sons
[36:07] have to be saved
[36:11] because they sons
[36:13] &gt;&gt; they're children.
[36:15] Lucifer and his angels
[36:18] are lost and they will their end is the
[36:20] lake of fire. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; You lot backslid and did the worst
[36:25] things and there's no way you can go to
[36:27] the lake of fire.
[36:29] &gt;&gt; You have to be saved
[36:31] &gt;&gt; because you come from him
[36:33] &gt;&gt; because you were in him before before
[36:35] the foundation of the world.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Sons cannot be lost
[36:39] &gt;&gt; forever.
[36:41] Amen.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Big difference, right?
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So this takes us back to the story
[36:46] of Job because all message Bible
[36:49] scholars who just love to be technical
[36:54] have to have their day in court.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Right? So let's go to Job 1:12.
[37:01] There was a man in the land of Uts
[37:06] in South African English today. I don't
[37:09] know the correct pronunciation is uts
[37:12] right from or the from the chaldes this
[37:15] man his name was Job this this is a
[37:18] story of Job right and that man was
[37:21] perfect and upright and one that feared
[37:24] God and estued evil and there were born
[37:27] unto him seven sons and three daughters
[37:32] Sunday school how many sons
[37:36] &gt;&gt; and how many daughters
[37:37] &gt;&gt; right His substance also was 7,000 sheep
[37:42] and 3,000 camels and 500 yolk of oxen
[37:46] and 500 she assasses and a very great
[37:49] household. So that this man was the
[37:52] greatest of all the men of the east
[37:56] job.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; Right? Some of you saying I I wish I
[38:00] could be as rich as this man. Trust me,
[38:03] you don't want to be brushing down 500
[38:05] she asses.
[38:08] and 500 yolk of oxen every day.
[38:12] And his sons went and feasted in their
[38:14] houses and everyone his day and sent and
[38:19] called for their three sisters to eat
[38:21] and to drink with him. He's trying to
[38:23] tell us how happy this family was.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; Every son, seven days of the week, each
[38:28] had his day. They all feasted in each
[38:30] other's house on a different day.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; And they each invited their three
[38:35] sisters. What nice brothers.
[38:40] Verse five. And it was so when the days
[38:43] of their feasting was gone about that
[38:46] Job sent and sanctified them and rose up
[38:49] early. Now, this is a real parent. He's
[38:52] not taking for granted, my kids are born
[38:54] in the message. They're baptized. They
[38:56] have the Holy Ghost. They're great.
[38:58] They're good. Let's forget about them.
[38:59] No. He rose up early in the morning and
[39:02] offered burnt offerings according to the
[39:04] number of them all. For Job said, "It
[39:07] may be that my sons have sinned and
[39:10] cursed God in their hearts."
[39:14] &gt;&gt; This is why God saw him as
[39:18] righteous.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't take it for granted that his
[39:22] children looked like they were message
[39:24] believers.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; He said they might have cursed God in
[39:29] their hearts. I want to take care of
[39:30] those hearts.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Verse six. Now there was a day when the
[39:35] sons of God. Now there this is where the
[39:38] story actually comes.
[39:40] When the sons of God came to present
[39:42] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[39:44] came also among them. And the Lord said
[39:47] unto Satan, "Whence comest thou?" That
[39:50] means where are you coming from? Then
[39:53] Satan answered the Lord and said, "From
[39:55] going to and fro in the earth, and from
[39:57] walking up and down in it, so casual,
[40:01] the devil talking to the creator."
[40:04] And the Lord said unto Satan, "Have you
[40:07] considered my servant Job?" Does the
[40:10] father bragging? And there is none like
[40:12] him in the other, a perfect and upright
[40:14] man, one that fearth God and is skeweth
[40:18] evil. Verse 9. And then Satan answered
[40:21] the Lord and said, um, doth Job fear God
[40:27] for not? That means, does he re does he
[40:30] really serve you for no reason?
[40:35] Have you not put an hedge about him? is
[40:38] not because you protect him
[40:40] &gt;&gt; with that message church and that cood
[40:44] &gt;&gt; and those deacons and those pastors and
[40:47] they're watching like hawks and that
[40:51] dress code and their all their laws and
[40:54] rules. Is it just because of that that
[40:57] you're keeping him hedged in and he's
[40:59] safe? Let him one day on university I'll
[41:01] show you who he is.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. put him in the workplace. In
[41:06] that place, even in the workplace, you
[41:08] got deacons working with him.
[41:14] Hast thou made an h about him and about
[41:17] his house and about all that he had
[41:19] every on every side. Thou was blessed
[41:22] the work of his hands and his substance
[41:24] is increasing. You've just given him
[41:26] blessings.
[41:27] God doesn't even deserve it. Verse 11,
[41:31] but put forth thy hand now and touch all
[41:33] that he hath and he will curse thee to
[41:36] your to thy face.
[41:39] That means make him uncomfortable. Give
[41:41] him sickness. Give him troubles. Give
[41:44] him financial issues. Give him economic
[41:47] issues. Give him trouble with his house.
[41:50] Break his stuff. He'll curse you. I bet
[41:54] you.
[41:56] Satan talking to the Lord. Can you
[41:57] believe it? So bold devil. And the Lord
[42:02] said unto Satan, "Behold, all that he
[42:04] hath is in thy power." And the Lord is
[42:06] said, the father is saying, "Okay,
[42:07] devil,
[42:09] do what you want.
[42:12] Go for it. Only upon himself, put not
[42:16] forth thine hand." So you can you can
[42:19] touch his children.
[42:22] You can do what you want to his animals,
[42:25] his house, his lands, just his life.
[42:28] You're not allowed to touch his life. So
[42:31] Satan went forth from the presence of
[42:33] the Lord. Now this isn't the first time.
[42:35] When you reach chapter 2, there's
[42:37] another meeting with the same scenario
[42:40] coming. The sons of God come to present
[42:42] themselves and Satan comes trapesing
[42:44] along. Where did you come from? From
[42:46] walking to and from the earth. have a
[42:47] consider myself it's like a repeat thing
[42:50] and and Job won the first battle and the
[42:53] next battle Satan is saying nah you're
[42:54] still helping him
[42:58] so that's the story okay Christian
[43:00] people
[43:02] uh theologians the ones who deserve the
[43:04] day in court they romanticize the story
[43:08] the reason why I'm actually telling you
[43:10] this is because they make it
[43:12] supernatural fantasy and do not see the
[43:15] truth this is not an actual occurrence.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; There is no devil who can just saunter
[43:23] in from the fifth dimension into the
[43:25] seventh dimension say, "Hey, how you
[43:27] guys doing? You know, good to see you
[43:29] again. It's been a few thousand years
[43:31] you guys kicked me out, but I'm back
[43:32] again just to hear what you guys have to
[43:34] say. Hey, big guy. what she's doing.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; This this is this is to me how
[43:41] ridiculous it is that Christians believe
[43:43] this
[43:44] &gt;&gt; that Lucifer just walks into heaven,
[43:46] waltes in and God says, "Hey, how you
[43:48] doing? Where you coming from?"
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, walking to and fro.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; No, saints, this is not an actual
[43:55] occurrence. This is a prophetic
[43:57] utterance.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; This is not before the foundation of the
[44:00] world either. Neither is there Satan
[44:03] walking in and when he pleases and just
[44:05] walks before the Lord. No, God doesn't
[44:09] really ask Satan a question like where
[44:11] are you coming from? He's God. He knows
[44:15] where he comes from, where he's going to
[44:17] everything. Why everyone asking that
[44:19] question?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Because it's a prophetic story.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[44:25] This wasn't an event where sons of God
[44:28] literally came to present themselves
[44:31] like um every day of the week, you know,
[44:34] um memo meeting for the board. Sons
[44:37] present yourselves Monday morning going
[44:39] to check up on your agenda and how
[44:41] things have been going.
[44:44] No, sons of God don't come to present
[44:46] themselves before God at certain times.
[44:51] What does it mean? This was just a
[44:53] parable. It was not talking about angels
[44:57] gathering and Satan coming in among the
[44:59] angels. It said sons of God, not stars.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; What this actually means is God was
[45:09] considering his children who are on
[45:12] earth.
[45:15] That's all. Not they were coming to him
[45:18] to present themselves. It didn't happen
[45:20] that on certain Monday morning at 10:00
[45:23] all the children of God in in the
[45:25] childies decided to offer sacrifice. So
[45:28] they were all presenting themselves in a
[45:30] line and then Satan was walking among
[45:32] them. No, it was simply God considering
[45:35] all his children.
[45:38] Right? When the prophet speaks about it,
[45:40] he doesn't speak as if they were angels.
[45:42] Go read the message. Brother Bam says
[45:44] they were children of God gathering, not
[45:47] angels. Brother Bram says, and this is
[45:49] what's beautiful. This is how we know
[45:51] it's a it's a prophetic parable. Brother
[45:54] uses that to say, tell me where
[45:59] the sons of God are gathered together
[46:02] that Satan isn't in the midst of them.
[46:06] We know Lucifer was kicked out of
[46:08] heaven. We know Lucifer and his angels
[46:10] kept not their first estate. We know
[46:14] there is a sixth dimension of angelic
[46:16] existence and a fifth dimension of
[46:18] Lucifer and his angels, fallen angels.
[46:21] They are two separate existences, two
[46:23] separate dimensions,
[46:25] they do not come together.
[46:30] Are you with us? So, brother says,
[46:32] wherever there are sons of God, Satan is
[46:36] among
[46:39] &gt;&gt; He said it was in Eden.
[46:42] It was among the disciples. It is in
[46:46] every church.
[46:48] Everywhere sons of God are gathered, the
[46:50] enemy comes in among them.
[46:54] Job 38 identifies that they shouted for
[46:57] joy before the foundation of the world.
[46:58] So the reason I read this story to you
[47:01] is because because we took Job 38 and we
[47:04] spoke about that. We spoke about morning
[47:06] stars and sons of God. Then people who
[47:09] are technical and supernatural fantasy
[47:12] kind of people come to verse one and two
[47:14] and say well explain that.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Well we do right sons of God coming
[47:20] together parable not fantasy not angels
[47:24] not Satan walking in with the angels
[47:26] with God in heaven bragging about Job.
[47:29] It is a prophetic parable saying God
[47:32] looking at his children considering Job
[47:35] and the enemy is basically expressing
[47:39] but you're blessing him. You're you're
[47:42] doing everything for him. You're
[47:43] protecting him. You're making him
[47:44] prosperous. Take away all that he has
[47:46] and let's test him.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; From there, I'd like you to understand
[47:51] God allowed the enemy to afflict his
[47:53] children.
[47:55] He lost all his children.
[47:58] The the order was not him. You can touch
[48:01] everything else. His children died. His
[48:04] wife told him to curse his god and die.
[48:10] Said, "You speak like a foolish woman."
[48:12] Okay, let's go to a story. Now, for
[48:15] those of you, you know, a lot of you,
[48:18] you're you're getting older now. And I
[48:21] mean, when I say older, I mean you're
[48:22] like my age or even younger. and you
[48:25] forget to read them, the really exciting
[48:28] parts of the message. It's good to go
[48:31] back and read those things,
[48:33] &gt;&gt; right? And I know a lot of you are busy
[48:35] with your jobs and your careers and your
[48:37] young people, your studies, but it's so
[48:40] good to read the message and especially
[48:43] those parts that bring you back to your
[48:46] old landmark.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the whole story I told you last
[48:51] week, the story of God and man from
[48:54] before the beginning is actually in the
[48:57] message on adoption.
[48:59] Okay? And uh that's one place where
[49:02] you'll find it. There are other places
[49:04] but that's one place. So I want to start
[49:05] reading there. And this is the fountain
[49:08] of life. Let me so I just want to tell
[49:11] you brother Baron said let me draw you a
[49:14] little illustration here. That means
[49:16] brother Ramy is saying let me draw you a
[49:18] picture. Like I was telling my little
[49:20] boy today I'm speaking on story of men
[49:22] and God part two. He says are there
[49:23] going to be pictures? I said yes and
[49:24] let's go.
[49:27] Okay. They like pictures. So brother
[49:30] Baron says let me draw you a little
[49:32] illustration here. It's good. You know
[49:34] what I like to say? These fellows will
[49:37] go around the world telling stories of
[49:39] brother Brandon. You know testimonies
[49:42] they were there. I don't know why they
[49:44] don't tell us what he drew. They're
[49:47] telling me about somebody's hat and this
[49:49] happened here and somebody got healed
[49:50] and like I want to know what did he draw
[49:52] on the board in adoption part two.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; You were there. Why don't you tell me
[49:57] that? Because I really want to know
[49:59] that. I don't care brother so and so was
[50:00] sitting there and got healed and all of
[50:02] that. That's very nice, but I want to
[50:04] know this drawing.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Nobody tells me that. Anyway, I believe
[50:10] I talked in a little bit the other night
[50:12] or struck it in Genesis chapter uh 1st
[50:15] chapter 126. When God called his name
[50:18] Lord God, it's in the word of ll Elohim,
[50:23] which means the self-existing one.
[50:25] There's that fountain, self-existing
[50:26] one. There was nothing else existed by
[50:29] him. There was no air. There was no
[50:31] light. There was no stars. There was no
[50:33] world. There was no nothing else. It was
[50:35] God and God alone. Llo him. Now he made
[50:40] that. What did he make? Right? So
[50:44] inside here's everything I told you
[50:47] inside of that was attributes which
[50:49] meant that inside of this great llla
[50:53] Elohim
[50:54] uh was an attribute. You know what an
[50:57] attribute is Sunday school or let me say
[51:01] it like this. The reason why I'm saying
[51:02] Sunday school,
[51:06] it was a nature that's so the little
[51:09] fellow will get it.
[51:13] &gt;&gt; Sunday school and I'm one of the little
[51:15] fellas that has to get it that way. So
[51:18] what is an attribute? An attribute is a
[51:20] nature.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Inside of him was the nature to be a
[51:24] father, but he is self-existent. There
[51:26] was then nothing for him to be a father
[51:28] by. And now down inside of that
[51:34] see I told you clusters inside of him
[51:37] was to be a father and inside of the
[51:40] attribute of father
[51:43] there was something else that he was god
[51:45] and that god an object of worship but he
[51:47] was self-existent llohim llohim so there
[51:51] was nothing to worship him inside of
[51:53] that he was savior and there's nothing
[51:56] lost to be saved see inside of that he
[51:59] was a healer And there was nothing sick
[52:01] to be healed and nothing to be sick. Now
[52:03] do you get the picture? So his
[52:04] attributes, his nature produced what is
[52:08] today.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Do you see the story?
[52:13] &gt;&gt; So you know I didn't make it up.
[52:16] Then some people say, "So now from that
[52:20] fountain where all the attributes are
[52:21] in, he becomes the logos and everything
[52:23] that was in him was poured into
[52:28] Christ. That fountain of life that was
[52:32] not known, that was a mystery, that was
[52:35] a complete mystery, could never be
[52:36] called anything, could never be
[52:37] worshiped, could not be seen, now became
[52:40] something that could be seen, something
[52:42] that could be related to, something that
[52:43] could be worshiped, something that could
[52:45] be understood, and it was called the
[52:47] word of God, the logos. Some people say,
[52:50] "Well, why didn't God just stop it in
[52:52] the beginning? He's a cruelhearted
[52:54] brute, said Joe Lewis. The one that
[52:57] condemned Joe or Jack Co said he's just
[53:00] a cruel brute. There's no such a thing
[53:03] as God. If there was such a thing, he'd
[53:05] be a, "Oh, I just call him all kind of
[53:06] name." See, but it's just because he
[53:08] might have a lot of knowledge up here,
[53:10] but he got nothing down here. Now,
[53:13] that's where it's at. See, this word
[53:15] tells it here, and he's hid it.
[53:19] And that's where I want to get to today.
[53:21] These mysteries, these natures, these
[53:24] attributes has been hid. Now remember
[53:27] the Bible said since the foundation of
[53:29] the world
[53:32] waiting for the manifestation of the
[53:35] sons of God.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; Those natures, those seeds, those
[53:39] attributes are hid in him and they're
[53:42] only revealed when they are manifested.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Glory. Those sons of God from the
[53:48] beginning who shouted
[53:50] the the secret of it is hidden until
[53:54] they are manifested in reality form.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God
[53:59] &gt;&gt; to display then to the church. Oh my.
[54:01] You get it? Last quote there. Now I'll
[54:04] stop on my story and he did it. Broke
[54:07] from there went on to something else.
[54:08] I'll stop on my story just a little bit.
[54:10] I'll bring I'll go to my text uh my next
[54:13] thought till I get this. Now remember,
[54:15] all through the ages of Moses, back
[54:18] through the ages of the prophets, back
[54:20] through all ages, they waited until this
[54:22] latter day for these things to be
[54:25] displayed according to the scripture.
[54:28] That's right. For it to be revealed to
[54:31] the sons of God,
[54:33] &gt;&gt; not angels,
[54:35] &gt;&gt; sons of God. So all those attributes,
[54:37] all the mysteries are to be revealed to
[54:40] the sons of God from the lost until like
[54:44] the pyramid. As I've said, building
[54:46] closer, closer, closer. Glory to God. So
[54:49] firstly, saints, it's important for you
[54:51] to know that the story we told you was
[54:54] not made up by me. It was something the
[54:56] prophet expressed in several places. We
[54:58] just put it together in picture form.
[55:01] I'm hoping one day Allah to speak to him
[55:03] and and hear what diagrams he drew.
[55:06] Now what is he talking about? What
[55:09] mysteries were hid? Are we together?
[55:12] &gt;&gt; What mysteries were hid and waiting for
[55:15] the manifestation of sons of God? There
[55:18] were natures of God that were not
[55:21] revealed that were not known. They could
[55:24] not they could never be known through
[55:27] the angels. That's why they required
[55:30] sons.
[55:31] All those natures of father, savior,
[55:34] healer, redeemer,
[55:36] etc. were not revealed because man had
[55:39] to be created and manifested for those
[55:43] natures of God to be revealed.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; And they said, "Amen."
[55:49] Let's go to the fellowship of the
[55:50] mystery.
[55:53] You remember that scripture? Okay.
[55:56] Ephesians 3:9. So here was this logos we
[56:00] spoke about just taking this clinker
[56:03] letting it go and say stop and that
[56:06] formed into a galaxy and that formed
[56:08] into a galaxy and that formed a galaxy
[56:09] started creating the universe. In the
[56:11] beginning God created the heavens and
[56:12] the earth and verse 9 of Ephesians 3 to
[56:16] make all men see what is the fellowship
[56:20] of the mystery
[56:22] which from the beginning of the world
[56:25] hath been hid in God.
[56:28] So firstly there is a mystery.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; Secondly there is a fellowship of the
[56:33] mystery.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Thirdly that fellowship of the mystery
[56:36] was hid in God.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Fourthly
[56:40] from the beginning of the world.
[56:43] Amen. Who created all things by Jesus
[56:48] Christ.
[56:49] This is amazing.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; This is amazing. You have a scripture
[56:53] here that tells you, you know, a people
[56:57] he made all things by Jesus Christ, but
[57:00] Jesus Christ only came 2,000 years ago.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; How did he then make all things by Jesus
[57:08] Christ?
[57:10] That tells you that Jesus Christ was
[57:12] that logos
[57:14] &gt;&gt; before it was manifested as Jesus
[57:16] Christ. The same way he was theophony,
[57:20] you are theophony. You come to theophony
[57:23] now you bypass the seed that you you
[57:25] came from seed straight to fallen form.
[57:28] Now you have to attain theophony to be
[57:31] like him. Is that right?
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul was speaking here the
[57:35] fellowship of the mystery from the
[57:36] beginning of the world had been hidden.
[57:38] God prior to this in the verses before
[57:41] he's speaking of himself and his
[57:42] ministry. He's saying that his purpose
[57:46] in his ministry is to show people the
[57:50] fellowship of the mystery.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; See, to make all men see what is.
[57:58] And so his ministry would show and this
[58:01] is what we are here for.
[58:03] Why are you manifested here?
[58:06] In the fact that you are united around
[58:08] the word, you are showing manifesting
[58:11] the fellowship of the mystery that was
[58:14] hid.
[58:16] And the fellowship is not every Sunday.
[58:18] Hey, God bless you. How you doing? Good
[58:20] to see you next Sunday.
[58:25] He's not that's he's not saying the
[58:27] mystery of fellowship.
[58:31] That that's what I think people mess
[58:32] around with. The mystery of fellowship.
[58:35] You know, fellowship is, you know, let's
[58:37] get together, have some tea and cake,
[58:38] and talk about the word.
[58:41] That's not fellowship. That's talking.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Fellowship means working together toward
[58:48] a common purpose.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; He's saying there is a fellowship of the
[58:54] mystery of God. Fellowship is a union of
[58:57] attributes, a cluster of natures. We are
[59:00] speaking of in the beginning. There's a
[59:01] mystery and there's a fellowship of the
[59:03] mystery. The fellowship of the mystery
[59:05] is made of attributes from before the
[59:08] foundation of the world. And then when
[59:10] those attributes are manifested, those
[59:12] attributes become sons
[59:14] &gt;&gt; in time. What's our subject about?
[59:17] Becoming sons.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Paul had a revelation.
[59:23] Are you still with me?
[59:24] &gt;&gt; That sons had to be manifested in time.
[59:27] You remember this?
[59:30] Romans 8:19. for the earnest expectation
[59:33] of the creature waited for the
[59:35] manifestation of the sons of God.
[59:38] So Paul is literally saying so the
[59:40] scripture shows it the rest of creation
[59:42] and not just the rest of creation. The
[59:44] creature is not creatures out there.
[59:46] It's this creature
[59:48] &gt;&gt; also. This creature your own body is it
[59:53] senses something. It senses that there
[59:56] must be a full redemption. It secretly
[59:59] yearns for the manifested sons of God.
[1:00:02] Hey,
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; manifest means to be revealed, to be
[1:00:08] made known.
[1:00:12] Is your body waiting for the manifested
[1:00:15] sons?
[1:00:17] Your body is waiting for one particular
[1:00:20] manifested son.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The one that matches you.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; That's the son. Amen.
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; Men of the Old Testament who God did
[1:00:36] such great things through. Most things
[1:00:38] were miraculous beyond anything that we
[1:00:41] have ever experienced. Do not they did
[1:00:44] not achieve full sun status.
[1:00:48] Wait, you just missed that or you didn't
[1:00:50] get the whole thing. I'm saying you got
[1:00:54] a guy like Moses
[1:00:56] or Noah who built this ark that saved
[1:00:58] the world. the the Moses who uh opened
[1:01:02] the Red Sea and did all those fantastic
[1:01:05] plagues. You know, I hear people today
[1:01:08] talking about
[1:01:10] the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter 2,
[1:01:13] you know, and how powerful it is and
[1:01:15] they came out and they they spoke in
[1:01:18] tongues, they prophesied and we must go
[1:01:19] back to that and
[1:01:23] you know what is speaking in tongues,
[1:01:25] prophesying and healing as compared with
[1:01:27] opening the Red Sea.
[1:01:30] and building an ark that saves the world
[1:01:33] or tearing out a lion from jaw to jaw.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; How about you spoke with tongs?
[1:01:40] Fantastic.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; H David one stone killing a giant who
[1:01:46] was going to decimate all of the
[1:01:48] Hebrews. But you spoke with tongs.
[1:01:51] Wumpy little fella.
[1:01:54] H this this is my point. Power. They
[1:01:57] want power.
[1:01:59] I'm saying to you with all the great
[1:02:02] power that Moses had, that David had,
[1:02:05] that Abraham had, that Noah had, that
[1:02:09] Samson, Jacob, Isaac, the whole lot of
[1:02:12] them, with all the great power they
[1:02:15] possessed, of spoken word, of having a
[1:02:17] pillar fire with them, of seeing angels,
[1:02:20] they did not attain sons of God status.
[1:02:25] They died and went to Abraham's bosom
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; which was fifth dimension.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; They did not enter into theophanes. When
[1:02:35] the witch of Endor called up Samuel
[1:02:38] spirit, she said, "I see an old man with
[1:02:40] a bald head covered in a mantle."
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; When brother Baron saw the generation of
[1:02:48] Christians, he said they were 18 to 21.
[1:02:51] sparkling eyes, sparkling teeth, brand
[1:02:54] new people,
[1:02:56] and that great prophet Samuel.
[1:03:00] You know, a lot of you young people, you
[1:03:01] need to go and read the story of Samuel.
[1:03:05] It is amazing.
[1:03:07] Samuel was the last judge.
[1:03:10] His story is amazing for young men to
[1:03:13] understand, to know what it means to
[1:03:15] serve God.
[1:03:17] the last judge and the first prophet in
[1:03:20] the promised land,
[1:03:24] right?
[1:03:26] He told the disciples, so Christ told
[1:03:28] the disciples,
[1:03:30] I must go to prepare a place for you
[1:03:34] that where I exist, you might exist
[1:03:36] also.
[1:03:39] &gt;&gt; Why did he say that? Because prior to
[1:03:42] that, there was no prepared theophanes.
[1:03:47] You had to wait for this son
[1:03:50] &gt;&gt; to come to bring forth many brethren
[1:03:53] like unto himself.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Right. So he told us to the disciples.
[1:03:58] In other words, he Christ came to make a
[1:04:02] way for those attributes that were in
[1:04:06] him that were hidden in him to who
[1:04:09] existed in heaven in the logos to now
[1:04:12] become theophanes.
[1:04:14] He came to make the way back possible.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; Those attributes were manifested on
[1:04:22] earth as fleshly bodies, but they were
[1:04:24] not yet revealed as sons of God.
[1:04:28] Becoming sons of God is bigger than just
[1:04:31] being in a church
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; and saying, "I'm a son of God. I accept
[1:04:36] that I was a sinner. He died for my
[1:04:38] sins. I'm waterbaptized." Sons of God
[1:04:40] has got to do with theophanes.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not people who claim to be
[1:04:45] Christians or people who claim to be
[1:04:47] sons of God. They did not
[1:04:51] reach the status of sons of God. They
[1:04:53] were sons of God. They were sons of God
[1:04:56] on earth because they believed in God
[1:04:59] because they followed his word. But they
[1:05:01] were not yet theophanes.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; The sons of God had not yet been
[1:05:07] revealed.
[1:05:11] you 1 Corinthians 15:47-49.
[1:05:16] The first man is of the earth, earthy.
[1:05:20] The second man is the Lord from heaven.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:27] &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; is yours the offer.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; As is the earth, such are they also that
[1:05:36] are earthy. As is the heavenly, such are
[1:05:39] they also. In other words, if you read
[1:05:41] before this, he's saying there's
[1:05:42] difference between bodies. There's
[1:05:43] celestial bodies and they have their
[1:05:44] glory. There's terrestrial bodies, they
[1:05:46] have their glory. Some men will come and
[1:05:48] ask, "What bodies will they come
[1:05:49] through?" That's how he preaches a
[1:05:50] sermon. Says, "Now verse 49, as we have
[1:05:55] borne the image of the earthy, we shall
[1:06:00] also bear the image of the heavenly."
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole
[1:06:05] uh theme of Paul's ministry is we have
[1:06:08] been called to become the sons of God.
[1:06:12] Right? Paul's entire message was that.
[1:06:14] Is that right? And then uh when Christ
[1:06:18] ascended, he took the spirits of the Old
[1:06:21] Testament saints that were trapped in
[1:06:22] the bosom of Abraham in paradise and he
[1:06:25] said paradise was emptied out.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; And he took those first. But they waited
[1:06:30] a few days in earthly dimension status
[1:06:34] trapped between two worlds and when he
[1:06:36] ascended he took them with him and then
[1:06:39] they attain sons of God status.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; How about you living on earth?
[1:06:50] As many as received him. Remember John
[1:06:54] 1:1. In the beginning was the word. The
[1:06:55] word was with God. The word was God. And
[1:06:58] all things were created by him. Amen.
[1:06:59] For him was everything created. And
[1:07:00] there came one uh uh John who came for a
[1:07:04] witness to bear witness of that light.
[1:07:05] But he was not that light.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he and he goes on and on on
[1:07:09] and he comes to verse 12 and he says,
[1:07:11] "As many as received him
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; to them gave he power to become
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; sons of God." Not even to become sons of
[1:07:22] God. To become the
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; sons of God.
[1:07:27] The sons of God is a specific
[1:07:29] designation that goes right back to
[1:07:31] before the world was not to become just
[1:07:34] sons of God. The sons of God to them
[1:07:36] that receive him gave he power. That's
[1:07:39] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That is
[1:07:41] the Holy Spirit being given to you
[1:07:43] giving you ability to become sons of
[1:07:45] God. Gives you that ability to believe
[1:07:48] the word so that your celestial body
[1:07:51] begins to grow in heaven.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. adoption part two. What do you
[1:07:57] think the writer of this book that seen
[1:08:00] and seen where it would be manifested in
[1:08:02] the last days waiting and groaning for
[1:08:04] those sons of God to rise in the last
[1:08:07] days with the power of the Holy Ghost at
[1:08:10] the end of the age? And all the
[1:08:11] ministries who love this story and all
[1:08:14] they stop with is the sons of God must
[1:08:16] rise up in the last days with the power.
[1:08:18] What power? speaking in tongues,
[1:08:20] prophesying, shouting, screaming, uh
[1:08:23] jumping around, Holy Ghost dynamics,
[1:08:26] this and that. What for?
[1:08:29] To what end?
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; We've seen that already.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; How is that revealing it again?
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; It was hidden. Now it must be revealed.
[1:08:41] We've seen all that already.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; that's doesn't need to be revealed. Yes,
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; those sons of God will rise in the last
[1:08:48] day with the power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:08:50] There's a special designation that must
[1:08:53] come at the end of the age for what
[1:08:55] reason? Not gifts of the Holy Ghost to
[1:08:59] reveal the secret things from the
[1:09:02] foundation of the world to bring it up.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 52. Now, let's go back into
[1:09:12] the foundation of the world again and
[1:09:13] get a revelation and see if it were
[1:09:16] right or not. The gifts of the Holy
[1:09:19] Ghost had to come in. It was the earnest
[1:09:23] to bring you to this point.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Had there been no sin, there would be no
[1:09:28] reason for gifts of the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; If we all came through Adam, why would
[1:09:34] we be speaking with tongues?
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Why would we be prophesying? Why would
[1:09:39] there be healing? Why would there be
[1:09:41] knowledge? Why would there be wisdom?
[1:09:44] Why would there be any other gifts of
[1:09:46] the Holy Ghost if we all came through
[1:09:48] Adam?
[1:09:49] That would have been the hidden things
[1:09:51] manifested.
[1:09:53] The the fellowship of the mystery
[1:09:55] revealed
[1:09:57] right now sitting here in this corrupt
[1:09:59] condition of earthly flesh. This is a
[1:10:03] fraction of what fellowship means.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; You're right. This isn't even a real
[1:10:09] thing. Half of you here don't even like
[1:10:10] each other. Don't bluff me.
[1:10:16] The rising of sons in the last days only
[1:10:20] occurs under the manifestation of the
[1:10:22] seventh seal because it is the mystery
[1:10:25] that brings him back to earth. It is the
[1:10:28] word coming to sons and sons becoming
[1:10:30] the word. It is the mystery of the
[1:10:33] rapture.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why the rapture is a
[1:10:37] mystery that must be revealed to the
[1:10:38] bride.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the rapture. They must
[1:10:45] rise.
[1:10:47] Sons of God to rise in the last. You
[1:10:50] know what rise means? Resurrected
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; in the last. That's the real
[1:10:54] resurrection.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; The resurrection of the living dead.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; You who were dead while you were living
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; needed to be resurrected. You needed
[1:11:05] connection
[1:11:06] with the mystery that was in him before
[1:11:09] the foundation of the world. That
[1:11:10] connection only comes by the open book
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; by the opening of the seventh seal.
[1:11:15] Without that, there is no connection.
[1:11:17] You're just some Christian moving
[1:11:19] through this life. But with the open
[1:11:21] book, with the angel descending with the
[1:11:23] seven seal opening in our day, and
[1:11:25] you're connected with that mystery that
[1:11:27] was in him before the foundation of the
[1:11:28] world, now you are resurrected.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] Now you have come from death into life.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And when does this happen? At the end of
[1:11:38] the age.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; When does the resurrection happen? At
[1:11:43] the end of the age. People are still
[1:11:45] waiting for a resurrection of the dead.
[1:11:47] We do not sorrow as those who have no
[1:11:49] hope. Those who you say are dead are not
[1:11:52] really dead. We know because the prophet
[1:11:54] has seen them already beyond the curtain
[1:11:56] of time. They are very much alive.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; They already in theophony.
[1:12:01] Amen.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; You do not prevent them which are
[1:12:04] asleep.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; That's why we don't sorrow as those who
[1:12:08] have no hope. I already know my father
[1:12:11] is enjoying his theophony right now.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; With so many of the other brothers that
[1:12:15] have gone on before and sisters and
[1:12:17] they're fellowshipping. We do not
[1:12:19] prevent them.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; We act like we're waiting for them to
[1:12:22] rise.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; They're waiting for you to rise. Amen.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; See, at the end of the age, to reveal
[1:12:33] and manifest the secret things from the
[1:12:36] foundation of the world. What secret
[1:12:38] things? Reveal and manifest. Paul states
[1:12:42] this clearly. Let's look at what Peter
[1:12:44] says. You love him, saints.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the God and father of
[1:12:49] our Lord Jesus Christ, which according
[1:12:51] to his abundant mercy hath begotten us
[1:12:55] again
[1:12:57] unto a life. He he begotten us sometime
[1:12:59] before. Now he's begotten us again unto
[1:13:03] a lively hope again because sin came in.
[1:13:07] He had to we became begotten sons in a
[1:13:10] sinful body of flesh. He had to now
[1:13:12] bring the attribute to its fullness.
[1:13:15] Right. Unto. So you are not just
[1:13:18] begotten.
[1:13:19] You know this baby just born.
[1:13:22] You are begotten unto something.
[1:13:26] You are begotten unto a lively hope.
[1:13:30] Lively hope. Right? Lively stones.
[1:13:35] Remember that. Do you know what lively
[1:13:38] in the Bible means? It's got eternal
[1:13:40] life.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; This life here is dying.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. A lively hope means an eternal
[1:13:47] ambition,
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; an eternal hope, an eternal target, an
[1:13:52] eternal end, eternal purpose. You are
[1:13:55] begotten to that.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; And that hope became a reality
[1:14:01] by the fact that Jesus rose from the
[1:14:04] dead by the resurrection of Christ. If
[1:14:07] Christ did not rise from the dead,
[1:14:10] nothing makes sense.
[1:14:12] making sense doesn't even sound right.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Nothing
[1:14:17] is meaningful.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; If he didn't rise from the dead, there
[1:14:21] is no hope of theophony.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; The fact that he rose from the dead from
[1:14:26] the dead gives us the lively hope.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; Got it. Verse four. To an inheritance.
[1:14:34] Now, there it is. This This should start
[1:14:37] stirring your heart up. Yes,
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; you are begotten to an inheritance.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; What inheritance? This inheritance is
[1:14:47] incorruptible,
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; right? Undefiled
[1:14:52] that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven
[1:14:56] for you.
[1:14:58] Verse five says, "Who
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; are kept by the power of God through
[1:15:05] faith unto salvation, ready to be
[1:15:08] revealed in the last time."
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; So he said, "We've been begotten again."
[1:15:18] He says in verse four, "Into an
[1:15:20] incorruptible inheritance." What is
[1:15:23] incorruptible inheritance? Incorruptible
[1:15:25] means it's not of earth.
[1:15:27] Yes.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; Anything of earth is corruptible.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; It breaks down. It's in time. It has
[1:15:32] bacteria. It breaks down. Decomposes.
[1:15:34] It's corruptible. Incorruptible means
[1:15:37] not of earth.
[1:15:40] Fadeth not away means it does not age.
[1:15:44] Means there is no time in it.
[1:15:48] It is not affected by the third
[1:15:49] dimension.
[1:15:51] Right? Fadeth not away. Undefiled means
[1:15:55] it has no sin.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; It cannot sin.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; Right? And then reserved in heaven for
[1:16:03] you kept by God. He could only say this
[1:16:06] after Christ,
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:10] You know, we sing just build me a
[1:16:12] mansion just over the hilltop.
[1:16:18] That's carnal man speaking. If you don't
[1:16:21] understand what that mansion is, Yeah,
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; it's not a triple story house with
[1:16:26] golden doors and circle staircase and
[1:16:29] grand piano underneath and lovely
[1:16:31] melodies playing through the whole
[1:16:33] system and Wi-Fi.
[1:16:39] Build me a mansion. This mansion is
[1:16:41] incorruptible. It has no sin. It's got
[1:16:43] no time in it. It does not fade away and
[1:16:45] it's reserved for you. It is your
[1:16:47] theophony body.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sorry to disappoint you if you're
[1:16:52] looking for a nicer house there,
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; but you know that's a nicer house,
[1:16:57] right?
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Because when the house of this
[1:17:00] tabernacle
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; be dissolved,
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; there is another one waiting.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; Another house. Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's my mansion.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Verse five. So in case you thought it
[1:17:11] was this kind of house, he says, "Who
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; famous reserved in heaven for you?" Who?
[1:17:18] Who speaks of a person? Amen.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; Who tells us it's not an object, it's
[1:17:23] not a building, it's not it's a person.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; It's a theophony
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; kept preserved by the power of God
[1:17:32] through faith and salvation.
[1:17:35] Your faith and salvation is keeping it
[1:17:39] by the power of God. Remember the quote
[1:17:41] we read last week, as the new birth
[1:17:43] grows in you, you have a celestial body
[1:17:45] growing in heaven. You cannot be in two
[1:17:47] bodies at once, but you can have two
[1:17:49] natures in you at once. But when this
[1:17:51] spirit leaves this body, you have
[1:17:53] another body waiting that you will go
[1:17:54] into.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; I had some very nice questions by the
[1:17:58] way, which I can't speak of of now, but
[1:18:02] it's like, you know, brother Al, what
[1:18:03] are what are theophies doing in heaven?
[1:18:05] If our spirits are here, what are they
[1:18:06] like?
[1:18:09] I love kids.
[1:18:11] They ask the best questions.
[1:18:14] Uh my answer is I have no idea.
[1:18:17] What happens under the seventh seal
[1:18:19] saints? The seven seal mystery. I know
[1:18:20] some of you going to come back and ask
[1:18:21] me that question.
[1:18:24] It is the manifestation of the sons of
[1:18:26] God. What is the seventh seal mystery?
[1:18:30] What is the the foundation the
[1:18:32] foundational quote of the seventh seal?
[1:18:35] The seventh seal brings him
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; back to earth.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:42] The revelation, the seventh seal brings
[1:18:44] him back to that's the foundation stone
[1:18:46] of it, right? What is it then? If it
[1:18:50] brings him back to earth, the seventh
[1:18:51] seal breaking, the book being opened,
[1:18:54] the attributes being revealed, the
[1:18:56] mystery being revealed, the fellowship
[1:18:57] of the mystery being revealed is the
[1:18:59] revealing of the sons of God that were
[1:19:02] hid in him before the foundation of the
[1:19:03] world. That is seeing your name in the
[1:19:06] book.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember how he speaks in the
[1:19:10] breach how John must have looked through
[1:19:11] the curtain. John just had a hallelujah
[1:19:15] shouting religion.
[1:19:17] Why? He said John must have seen him his
[1:19:19] name in the book.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; And he said there's John.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; He identified himself with what God
[1:19:27] revealed under the seventh seal.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The completion saints
[1:19:31] is when all that is in heaven and all
[1:19:33] that is in earth that was in Christ
[1:19:36] comes together in a union. Ephesians
[1:19:40] 1:10.
[1:19:41] Is that right? All that was in heaven,
[1:19:43] all that is in earth in Christ comes
[1:19:47] together. Invisible union of the
[1:19:49] heavenly and the earthly. The marriage
[1:19:52] of the lamb and his bride.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; That's the completion. So, it is the
[1:19:56] fellowship of the mystery that was
[1:19:58] hidden God before the foundation of the
[1:19:59] world. 2,000 years ago, Paul knew they
[1:20:03] had son of God status.
[1:20:06] Is that right? Paul knew. Now, we have
[1:20:09] son of God status, but the fullness of
[1:20:12] it was not yet revealed to them. How do
[1:20:15] we know? Okay,
[1:20:18] Sunday school, remember this? We were
[1:20:19] speaking about this before. 1 and two.
[1:20:23] Behold, what manner of love the father
[1:20:26] hath bestowed upon us. Some of you don't
[1:20:28] get lost in the song, please.
[1:20:31] That we should be called the sons of
[1:20:34] God.
[1:20:37] This is Peter making a confession,
[1:20:40] right? Please, this is not salty
[1:20:43] song book.
[1:20:47] I see some of you don't know what I'm
[1:20:49] talking about. You didn't grow up. You
[1:20:51] were lucky enough not to grow up with
[1:20:52] Salty.
[1:20:55] that we should be called the sons of
[1:20:57] God. Therefore, the world knoweth us
[1:21:01] not. That's telling you it was a mystery
[1:21:04] hit.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Because it knew him not.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; the revelation of who he is reveals to
[1:21:18] you who you are. The world cannot know
[1:21:21] who you are because they cannot know who
[1:21:22] he is because they do not know who he
[1:21:24] is. What is the revelation of God? It is
[1:21:28] Christ. What is the revelation of
[1:21:30] Christ? It is you.
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; The bride. He hath declared the father
[1:21:35] who hath declared the son.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; And the revelation of it all. St. John
[1:21:39] 14:20. In that day you shall know that I
[1:21:42] am in the father, the father in me, I in
[1:21:45] you, you in me. We are one. Brother
[1:21:47] Mhamm completes that whole thing.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Beloved, now are we the sons of God.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; And Peter is saying, Peter is is saying
[1:21:58] it does not yet appear what we shall be.
[1:22:01] In other words, I don't really know
[1:22:03] what's the revelation of that theophony.
[1:22:05] Right now, we don't have the full
[1:22:07] revelation of what it's going to be.
[1:22:08] People only think this is about the
[1:22:10] bodies, you know, corporal body and this
[1:22:14] it does it does not yet appear what we
[1:22:16] shall be. They only attribute this to
[1:22:18] the the physical substance of the body.
[1:22:21] But when he shall appear, we shall be
[1:22:23] like him. Again, they only limit that to
[1:22:25] the body.
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; For we shall see him as he is.
[1:22:30] This is talking about the revelation of
[1:22:32] sons of God. This talking about the
[1:22:34] fellowship of the mystery being
[1:22:36] revealed. Peter does not know because
[1:22:38] the whole body has not yet been
[1:22:40] manifested.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Peter has not seen the age of Smyrna,
[1:22:45] the age of thyra, the age of Pergamus.
[1:22:48] He has not seen Sardis, Philadelphia,
[1:22:50] Leosia, the capsule age. He cannot know
[1:22:53] the mystery. It does not yet appear what
[1:22:56] we shall be. But we know when he shall
[1:22:58] appear, we shall be like him.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; That's what we stand on. But today,
[1:23:03] we're not saying that. Today we are
[1:23:05] right here looking back.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; We have seen it all manifested. We've
[1:23:10] seen all the virtues. We've seen all the
[1:23:12] church ages. All the mysteries are
[1:23:14] revealed. The prophet came to tell us
[1:23:15] this seventh messenger will reveal all
[1:23:17] the mysteries.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; That's what happens under revelations
[1:23:21] 10. The mystery of God is finished as he
[1:23:24] had declared to his servants a prophet.
[1:23:26] We don't say it does not yet appear what
[1:23:28] we shall be. We know there is a
[1:23:30] fellowship of the mystery. We see
[1:23:32] ourselves included in all of that. Peter
[1:23:34] didn't know us. We know him.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Paul in prophecy was prophesying of the
[1:23:43] opening of the seventh seal and the book
[1:23:44] coming down.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; The first church with such great signs
[1:23:48] and wonders in Christ recognized the
[1:23:50] manifestation in themselves. They could
[1:23:53] feel it. They could know I have an angel
[1:23:56] that is beholds the face of the father
[1:23:58] in heaven. They could understand that I
[1:24:01] have a body. I have a theophony
[1:24:02] somewhere.
[1:24:04] They could sense there were sons. They
[1:24:06] could feel the connection with their
[1:24:09] theophonies, but not in its fullness.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Paul could see that it would take the
[1:24:14] second coming of Christ for the fullness
[1:24:17] of the revelation to be complete.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read in the adoption
[1:24:22] message. You you love him, saints?
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's very small. Okay, if you
[1:24:27] can follow me now, let's read just a
[1:24:29] little further. And we have he says he
[1:24:31] reads according as he had chosen us in
[1:24:32] the foundation of the world there be
[1:24:34] holy without blame before him in love
[1:24:36] having predestinated us unto adoption
[1:24:38] predestinated unto the adoption of
[1:24:40] children by Jesus Christ himself
[1:24:41] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:24:43] will. What did he do? By fornowledge he
[1:24:48] foresaw us knowing that he was a savior
[1:24:52] self-existent. There was no angels or
[1:24:54] nothing. Just God l Elohim with a
[1:24:57] self-existence one. Nothing but him
[1:24:59] alone. But in him was savior. But what's
[1:25:02] he going to say? There's nothing lost.
[1:25:04] knowing that that he knowed that this
[1:25:07] great attribute in him would project
[1:25:10] something out yonder that he could save.
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; Then when it did that by fornowledge he
[1:25:18] looked and looked down and saw everyone
[1:25:22] that would accept it
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; by fornowledge. You know, this this is a
[1:25:30] mystery where you bring the two sides of
[1:25:32] predestination together
[1:25:35] because the Calvinism idea just sends
[1:25:37] people crazy. You mean God just had
[1:25:40] these selective chosen people, you know,
[1:25:43] and he's so unfair? No. He's saying here
[1:25:45] he looked by fornowledge and saw
[1:25:47] everyone would accept it.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; And he saw everyone who would accept it.
[1:25:51] He recognized something about his
[1:25:53] creation, those coming in that time. and
[1:25:56] he could see the attribute that matches
[1:25:58] with that
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; in time. Therefore, when the attribute
[1:26:03] hits this body, it is grace to the body.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; That's what grace is. The attribute that
[1:26:11] is in me, he could have put in anyone
[1:26:12] else at some other time. But it would
[1:26:14] need the same characteristics.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; But in this time, that attribute found
[1:26:20] you.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; He could see it. He could place it. He
[1:26:23] could predestinate it by forn knowledge.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. You still with me?
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; And then by doing so, he said to save
[1:26:33] that the only way I can do it will be
[1:26:35] come down myself and be made flesh and
[1:26:37] take the sin of man upon him and die for
[1:26:39] him that I might be the one that's
[1:26:41] worshiped because he's God the object of
[1:26:42] worship. Paragraph 109.
[1:26:46] All right.
[1:26:47] Then he come down and take it upon
[1:26:49] himself. And while he did that, he did
[1:26:51] that that he might save you who wants to
[1:26:54] be saved.
[1:26:56] See, free will is still in there.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean by fornowledge
[1:27:00] the infinite God who know all things saw
[1:27:02] the lamb? He slayed the lamb before the
[1:27:04] foundation of the world. He put your
[1:27:05] name in the lamb's book of life. He seen
[1:27:07] the deceitfulness of Satan, what he
[1:27:09] would do. So he put your name on there
[1:27:14] and he said that Antichrist would be so
[1:27:16] religious, so good, such a fine fellow,
[1:27:18] such a smart man, such a religious man
[1:27:20] that he could deceive the very elect if
[1:27:22] it was possible. But it isn't impossible
[1:27:25] because it is impossible because their
[1:27:28] names were for ordained before the
[1:27:29] foundation of the world. There are those
[1:27:31] attributes hidden in him before the
[1:27:33] foundation of the world. There is no way
[1:27:36] those attributes will fail.
[1:27:39] Your body might fail.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; This body is going to fight back against
[1:27:44] it.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; But there's something about your soul.
[1:27:47] Your soul has free will but wants to
[1:27:51] choose God's will.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; I like this last part. There you are.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] saints. He knew you wanted to be saved
[1:28:03] while others wouldn't.
[1:28:06] That's a big deal. Therefore, you were
[1:28:08] part of the cluster of attributes who
[1:28:09] would desire salvation and desire to be
[1:28:13] connected to the attribute. You know, I
[1:28:16] could I could spend a lot of time
[1:28:18] telling you who you are right now,
[1:28:20] who you really are.
[1:28:23] Hm. Losers,
[1:28:27] racists,
[1:28:29] jealous,
[1:28:31] lustful.
[1:28:33] Yeah, that's all that this body is.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Envious, covetous,
[1:28:41] all of that.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; But there's something about you.
[1:28:46] Listen, if you just leave the message,
[1:28:47] you become everything you preached
[1:28:49] against.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; Instantly.
[1:28:53] Just leave the word of God. You will
[1:28:55] become everything you preached against.
[1:28:59] You will be the biggest hypocrite in the
[1:29:02] world
[1:29:04] because everyone you spoke against or
[1:29:07] judged, you'll be worse than them
[1:29:09] tenfold.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; The attribute of who you are in Christ
[1:29:16] was preserved in him until the time
[1:29:19] appointed so that it would face the
[1:29:21] challenge of its time and defeat the
[1:29:23] enemy. The reason the attribute is
[1:29:27] placed in you and that particular
[1:29:29] attribute is because there's something
[1:29:31] in there that needs to be overcome.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; And that attribute has the power to
[1:29:37] overcome that.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why you are not better
[1:29:41] than someone else.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; You're not higher than someone else.
[1:29:44] Someone else doesn't have your
[1:29:46] experience. Someone else can never have
[1:29:48] your struggle.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; You have an attribute in you to deal
[1:29:53] with that.
[1:29:55] That's the purpose. By that attribute
[1:29:58] doing what it's meant to do, it will
[1:30:00] reveal the fellowship of the mystery.
[1:30:05] There you would come to earth in
[1:30:07] attribute form according to his sewing
[1:30:09] of the seed. The seed would be swed in
[1:30:11] the chosen body and believe the word for
[1:30:14] its day. It would remain a mystery until
[1:30:17] the seventh seal open and Jesus himself
[1:30:20] descended with wait for it.
[1:30:27] Jesus descended with a
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; shout. Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Go back to the title. Amen.
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Angels sing.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Sons of God shout.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouted for joy.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; Again, those attributes in the beginning
[1:30:51] were not screaming.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; What is a shout? Amen. Let's read the
[1:30:56] rapture. Sunday school, listen up. Three
[1:30:59] things happen. A voice, a shout, a
[1:31:02] voice, a trumpet has to happen before
[1:31:04] Jesus appears. Now, a shout Jesus does
[1:31:08] all three of them when he is descending.
[1:31:10] A shout. What is the shout? It's the
[1:31:13] message coming forth first. The living
[1:31:17] bread of life bringing forth the bride.
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; There is the shout.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouted for joy.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this happens in his descent.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; This only comes down with the open book.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Not before that.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; Before that, they still did not know the
[1:31:37] fellowship of the mystery. They still
[1:31:39] didn't have the shout.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; But the shout has come down with the
[1:31:42] second coming of the Lord.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Paul knew that it would be revealed.
[1:31:47] See, in attribute, if they shouted in
[1:31:49] manifested time, in manifested uh form,
[1:31:53] there has to be a shout again.
[1:31:55] Sons of God must shout for joy.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; There is now silence in heaven, but
[1:32:02] there's a great shout on earth.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; People take these and make these
[1:32:07] literally about shouting with vocal
[1:32:09] cords.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; What vocal cords did the attributes have
[1:32:13] in heaven?
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; The shout was a mystery because it was
[1:32:18] the hidden attribute form before the
[1:32:20] foundation of the world. It was in
[1:32:22] attribute form. It was not shouting with
[1:32:24] vocal cords the same way it was in
[1:32:26] singing with vocal cords.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Singing was proclaiming a victory.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Shouting is what? If singing was
[1:32:36] overcoming for the angels, what is the
[1:32:38] shout for sons of God? There was no one
[1:32:41] to manifested before. It could only be
[1:32:44] manifested in the end time because the
[1:32:47] sons of God are revealed in the end
[1:32:48] time.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Now it is manifest. A shout went out by
[1:32:54] a voice crying in the wilderness of
[1:32:56] Pentecost, "Come out of her, my people."
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of her sins,
[1:33:02] &gt;&gt; that was a shout that attracted us,
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; right? And told us never to be a part of
[1:33:08] organized religion again.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; It's not talking about your Methodist
[1:33:13] church, you came from, your Catholic
[1:33:15] church, you came from, this church, and
[1:33:16] that. He's talking about organized
[1:33:18] religion. Yes.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Come out of her, my people, and be not
[1:33:23] partakers of her sins and her
[1:33:25] abominations.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; The a shout crying in the wilderness of
[1:33:29] Pentecost called us in.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Babylon is judged. It is fallen. And
[1:33:34] then comes the shout of the bride. You
[1:33:37] believe that?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; I want you to see this. I'm going to
[1:33:39] read this quote for you from why I am
[1:33:41] against organized religion. Notice the
[1:33:43] 19th chapter in is next.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Everyone awake.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; buckle your seat belts.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; After these things. That's that's the
[1:33:53] key there. After these things. After
[1:33:56] what things is reading Revelations 19,
[1:33:59] that means it's after Revelations 18 and
[1:34:02] Revelation 17 and Revelation 16. Right?
[1:34:05] What is Revelation 16? The vials,
[1:34:07] whatever. Revelation 17, the revelation
[1:34:09] of the great that sits upon the
[1:34:11] beast with seven heads and 10 horns. In
[1:34:13] Revelations 18 is the destruction of
[1:34:15] that great and the beast. After
[1:34:18] these things,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; did you notice here in Revelations 19?
[1:34:23] After these things, watch. After what?
[1:34:27] After the message of come out of her.
[1:34:32] After that me, after the message of come
[1:34:35] out of her, watch is the shout of the
[1:34:39] bride saints with the bridegroom. Amen.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Going to the marriage of the lamb. How
[1:34:46] close are we then, brother? What's the
[1:34:48] last call? Come out of Babylon. What's
[1:34:50] the last call? Come out of Babylon. Come
[1:34:52] out of organized religion.
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; Don't come and form a message church and
[1:34:56] form an organized religion again.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Come out of her. That's the reason
[1:35:01] message people are failing. You come out
[1:35:03] of one system into another system. You
[1:35:06] put in cold and formalism into the word.
[1:35:08] You put in radicalism into the word. You
[1:35:11] make another system. When you come out
[1:35:13] of a system and you bind people to a
[1:35:15] system, these are sons of God. They were
[1:35:18] not bound before the foundation of the
[1:35:20] world. They were free in him. They had a
[1:35:22] shout in them. If they shouted in
[1:35:25] attribute form, there must be a shout in
[1:35:27] this time. You will not hear a shout. If
[1:35:29] there's organized religion, because the
[1:35:31] first shout was, "Come out of her, my
[1:35:33] people." And after Babylon is destroyed,
[1:35:36] that is the shout of the bride saints
[1:35:38] with the bridegroom. Amen.
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; This is now.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You want to read
[1:35:44] Revelation 19:1-7 with me? This is the
[1:35:47] shout that comes after the shout of come
[1:35:49] out of her.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you ready?
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Ah, looks like I went back to that.
[1:36:00] Revelations 19 1-7. We'll start 1 to 3.
[1:36:03] After these things, after what things?
[1:36:08] destruction of organized religion. I
[1:36:10] don't want you to ever say that is the
[1:36:13] Catholic Church and the Vatican and the
[1:36:16] Methodist and the Baptist and all that
[1:36:18] because you people make up organized
[1:36:21] religion.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the organized religion
[1:36:25] you made up by your free will
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; to trap yourself and other people into
[1:36:32] come out of her.
[1:36:34] You will only see the fellowship of the
[1:36:36] mystery manifested in you. You will only
[1:36:39] have this shout when you come out of
[1:36:41] that thing.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Stop blaming denominational people or a
[1:36:45] previous religion you came from or some
[1:36:47] other kind of thing. You have to come
[1:36:49] out of that that needs to be destroyed.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; And there is the shout. Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] Salvation and glory and all the symbols.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; there's a reality to this. And honor and
[1:37:01] power unto the Lord our God. Here it is.
[1:37:04] For true and righteous are his
[1:37:07] judgments. For he hath judged the great
[1:37:10] which did corrupt the earth with
[1:37:12] her fornication and had avenged the
[1:37:15] blood of his servants at her hand.
[1:37:19] And again they said hallelujah. And her
[1:37:22] smoke rose up forever and ever. This is
[1:37:25] the shout. The first part of the shout
[1:37:27] is what? The rejoicing. The
[1:37:30] manifestation that in you is judged the
[1:37:35] great
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; The fellowship of the mystery, the
[1:37:40] strength of the attribute in you is to
[1:37:42] break up organized religion.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; It is the mark of the beast.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; You cannot stand it.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; you cannot stay in it. You cannot make a
[1:37:53] new message denomination.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; This attribute will not do that.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will not cluster together
[1:38:00] because that organized religion spirit
[1:38:03] is not of the same purpose.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; It cannot speak for God. It cannot stand
[1:38:09] in this world. It will join itself with
[1:38:11] fallen angels.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; The first part of the shout is what is
[1:38:17] that? What is it? It's the revelation
[1:38:19] the seals.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; What is the exposing and the judgment of
[1:38:22] the great war which should corrupt the
[1:38:24] earth with the fornication? That is the
[1:38:26] exposing the seals. When you break off
[1:38:28] the religious spirit and the political
[1:38:30] spirit and the demonic spirit and the
[1:38:32] paleos rider and the fifth seal and the
[1:38:34] sixth seal, you are exposing organized
[1:38:36] religion, you are laying it flat on its
[1:38:39] back. You are slaughtering it and
[1:38:41] dissecting it into pieces. It tells you
[1:38:43] what each spirit is. It tells you
[1:38:45] religious spirit is a poser, is an
[1:38:47] impostor. It's religion. It's your
[1:38:50] prayer life. It's your reading your
[1:38:51] message books. It's listening to your
[1:38:53] tapes. It's all the new system you
[1:38:55] created. It's a white horse rider acting
[1:38:58] like you're righteous but no faith
[1:39:00] inside.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; No standing for truth.
[1:39:04] Glory to God.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; That's the first part of the shout. And
[1:39:08] the 4 and 20 elders when the 4 and20
[1:39:10] elders see that that's the old and new
[1:39:12] testament. When they see that breaking
[1:39:15] of organized religion in you, it bows
[1:39:17] down.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the New Testament gives up
[1:39:21] all the types and shadows and reveals
[1:39:24] everything that you have confessed that
[1:39:26] you have done. God that sat on the
[1:39:28] throne saying, "Amen. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:39:31] be to God." And a voice came out of the
[1:39:33] throne saying, "Praise our God, all ye
[1:39:36] servants, and you that fear him both
[1:39:38] small and great. And I heard as it were
[1:39:41] the voice of a great multitude, there it
[1:39:43] is. Shout, and the voice of many waters,
[1:39:47] and as the voice of mighty thunderings
[1:39:50] sing, hallelujah, for the Lord God
[1:39:52] omnipotence reignth. Here it is. Let us
[1:39:56] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[1:39:59] him, for the marriage of the lamb is
[1:40:02] come and his wife had made herself
[1:40:04] ready.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; What? So the first part of the shout is
[1:40:07] the exposing of organized religion, the
[1:40:10] exposing of the enemy. The second part
[1:40:12] is they shouted for
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; joy. Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[1:40:19] honor to him because what is happening?
[1:40:22] The second part of the shout is uniting
[1:40:25] with the word,
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; the bridegroom. So you break away from
[1:40:30] the old system and you come in a perfect
[1:40:32] union with a revealed word of the hour.
[1:40:36] That is connecting with sons of God.
[1:40:38] That is connecting with theophony. That
[1:40:40] is not religion. There's nothing anyone
[1:40:42] can reveal to you about that. Nobody's
[1:40:45] going to show that to you personally.
[1:40:47] That is something can only happen when
[1:40:49] you break away completely from every
[1:40:52] form of system religions. Amen.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "This is the shout of
[1:40:57] the bride and the bridegroom that comes
[1:40:59] after that."
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Come out of her was the prophet's
[1:41:05] ministry.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; After that
[1:41:11] is the shout of the bride saints and the
[1:41:14] bridegroom.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 1-9.
[1:41:19] We read 1:7.
[1:41:21] We are the attributes that shouted in
[1:41:23] the beginning from the foundation of the
[1:41:25] world. We are the part of the cluster
[1:41:27] that is called bride and bridegroom
[1:41:30] because we once shouted in third form
[1:41:32] when we are manifested on earth. We will
[1:41:36] find one another.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; We will be drawn together because there
[1:41:41] is now a shout in us.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; The shout has come in his descent. He's
[1:41:46] brought that book down. There is a
[1:41:48] shout. That shout revealed the enemy,
[1:41:51] exposed false religion and and
[1:41:53] introduced us to our bridegroom. That
[1:41:55] shout is in us. We live for that.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; We correct ourselves for that every
[1:42:01] single day.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Every single day, we feel that
[1:42:04] conviction inside. I shouldn't do this.
[1:42:06] I shouldn't do this. This isn't right.
[1:42:08] Nobody else lives like that.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Nobody else has the fellowship of the
[1:42:14] mystery. Those people out there don't
[1:42:16] even care what happens in their lives.
[1:42:18] They can drink a beer, wine, whatever
[1:42:20] without even any conscience problems.
[1:42:23] They can fornicate. They can do drugs.
[1:42:25] They can smoke. They can swear. They can
[1:42:26] curse. They can do everything they want
[1:42:28] to do. No problem.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Not you.
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; You will torment yourself
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; because there is a shout.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; There's something drawing you together.
[1:42:39] There's a cluster of attributes that are
[1:42:42] manifested in this day that are
[1:42:44] connected with a theophony because sons
[1:42:46] of God are being revealed in this time.
[1:42:50] What is the shout in us? Praise be to
[1:42:52] God. If you take that where it says
[1:42:55] praise be to our God. Let's put it in
[1:42:57] our language.
[1:43:00] When it says um let us be glad and
[1:43:03] rejoice or the previous one, right? We
[1:43:06] acknowledge the revealing of the seals
[1:43:09] that has exposed the defeating the
[1:43:11] defeated enemy.
[1:43:14] I'm just telling you what it says in our
[1:43:15] language. You have now rightfully judged
[1:43:18] where it says you are the righteous and
[1:43:20] true judge. You have rightfully and true
[1:43:23] truly judged the immoral spirit of
[1:43:25] organized religion which corrupted all
[1:43:28] of human nature. Did you see that?
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; That for true and righteous are your
[1:43:33] judgments. He had judged the great war
[1:43:36] which did corrupt the earth with her
[1:43:38] fornication.
[1:43:39] Right? There's the first part. We
[1:43:42] acknowledge your judgment. That means
[1:43:44] Lord, I believe the revelation of the
[1:43:47] seven seals
[1:43:49] completely.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; With all my soul cuz I know it
[1:43:54] completely judges immoral organized
[1:43:58] religion.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I will never be a part of that.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Right? You have set right what has been
[1:44:04] done wrong against and it says which had
[1:44:06] avenged the blood of his servants at her
[1:44:09] hand.
[1:44:11] Organized religion has murdered
[1:44:15] children of God.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; Not just in real life but also robbed
[1:44:20] them of happiness.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; Robbed them of things they could have
[1:44:25] throughout the ages.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal being open has judged
[1:44:29] her. It's over.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; And lastly,
[1:44:38] that last point, let us be glad and
[1:44:39] rejoice. I challenge any one of you.
[1:44:43] Don't do it now. Could take out those
[1:44:45] wonderful phone of yours and Google the
[1:44:49] meaning of the word rapture.
[1:44:52] How many think you know what rapture
[1:44:54] means? Anybody?
[1:44:57] Yes. Not the drug.
[1:45:02] Joy.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; That's the real meaning of rapture.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Extreme joy.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Intense joy
[1:45:17] that gathers your spirit up into an
[1:45:20] elated state. That is English.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what rapture actually.
[1:45:26] Imagine all this time we're going on
[1:45:28] about rapture being transfiguration,
[1:45:30] translation, and making doctrines about
[1:45:32] it. Talk about bodies and all of that.
[1:45:35] Rapture is extreme joy.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Extreme joy, intense joy that elates
[1:45:41] your spirit and makes you rise to a
[1:45:43] higher dimension.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; That is what existed in the beginning in
[1:45:48] those attributes that were hidden in
[1:45:50] him. That was hidden. That cannot be
[1:45:53] known if you are still stuck in
[1:45:55] organized religion. Why do you hunger
[1:45:57] thirst? Why do you fail? Why does the
[1:46:00] heavenly father is trying to reveal all
[1:46:02] these mystery secrets to you, but you'll
[1:46:04] let so many things get these things out
[1:46:05] of you? This is what the world is trying
[1:46:07] to do. He's trying to create another
[1:46:09] Eden for you. Is that right? It's what
[1:46:11] we spoke about last week. He cannot
[1:46:13] touch the word. The seven seal has laid
[1:46:15] it flat. The the seals being open has
[1:46:18] opened up everything to us. You you
[1:46:20] cannot give us organized religion again.
[1:46:22] You cannot force feed that to us. It's
[1:46:24] not going to happen. The only last thing
[1:46:27] this enemy has is to produce another
[1:46:30] Eden,
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; a better Eden,
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; a nicer life, a better distraction from
[1:46:36] what? From coming together.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; From the fellowship of the mystery,
[1:46:41] dividing the brotherhood. That's the
[1:46:43] last play the enemy has, right? What
[1:46:46] does the loss play at the at the at the
[1:46:48] supper table before Christ was
[1:46:49] crucified?
[1:46:52] Who should be the one who would
[1:46:55] betray you?
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Lord, tell us. Is it he? Is it him?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; And he says to them,
[1:47:06] Peter, feed my sheep.
[1:47:09] Keep the brotherhood.
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; That's your strength.
[1:47:14] Stay united, stay one.
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; What is the enemy going to do?
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; He will produce a better Eden for you, a
[1:47:23] better idea, a better uh form of life, a
[1:47:27] better way to serve God, a better way to
[1:47:29] produce the bride, a better way to come
[1:47:31] to the capstone, a another way to bring
[1:47:33] forth sons of God, another idea,
[1:47:37] breaking up the brother. That that's
[1:47:39] what's happening right now. We are
[1:47:41] sniping at each other. ministers sniping
[1:47:43] at each other from pulpits.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Bringing each other down. Why would you
[1:47:47] do that?
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; For us, it means the uniting together of
[1:47:54] manifested attributes of this day that
[1:47:56] express the purpose of God that was kept
[1:47:59] secret through time but revealed in the
[1:48:01] last days. Verse 8 says, "And to her,"
[1:48:06] that's not there. That is after the
[1:48:08] shot. "And to her," are you ready? was
[1:48:12] granted that she should be arrayed in
[1:48:14] fine linen, clean and white. For the
[1:48:18] fine linen is the righteousness of
[1:48:20] saints.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; What is the fine linen you are waiting
[1:48:24] to be clothed in? Clean and white, which
[1:48:28] is the righteousness of saints for the
[1:48:31] rapture.
[1:48:33] Where is that cloth coming from?
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is your theophony.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; That is the sons of God.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; That is the fullness. That is the the
[1:48:45] the fullness of adoption. That's what
[1:48:47] you have been predestinated unto. To her
[1:48:51] was granted that she should receive her
[1:48:54] theophony. That the bride would be
[1:48:56] clothed in the theophony she long
[1:48:59] awaited for. That is the completion of
[1:49:02] sons.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Morning stars sang and sons of God
[1:49:07] shouted for joy. Amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Angels overcame fallen angels, but sons
[1:49:12] of God manifest the fellowship of the
[1:49:15] mystery that was hidden God before the
[1:49:17] foundation of the world. And that is the
[1:49:20] fellowship of the mystery.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Is God becoming man and man becoming
[1:49:26] God?
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; God became man in Jesus Christ.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; You become theophony which is King
[1:49:33] Theophony.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. God becoming man, man becoming
[1:49:37] God. There is the mystery. It is only
[1:49:40] manifested in manifested signs.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads
[1:49:45] together. Amen.
