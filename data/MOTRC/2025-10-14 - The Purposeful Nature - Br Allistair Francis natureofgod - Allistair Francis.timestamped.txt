[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] Amen. Let us bow our heads as we pray.
[0:05] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[0:07] [Music]
[0:09] Heavenly Father, how wonderful it is to
[0:12] be in your presence
[0:14] with saints of light, precious faith.
[0:17] Lord, worshiping before your holy name.
[0:22] Your name is our identification.
[0:25] Your name is our strength in this time.
[0:29] Your bride is the group of people that
[0:32] know the true name of the Lord in this
[0:34] day. And we have the authority
[0:38] by that name to speak the word in this
[0:41] time. Lord, we receive your word. We
[0:45] worship you through it. Lord, you have
[0:48] revealed the secrets of the universe to
[0:50] us. You have revealed your purpose and
[0:52] your plan for the ages for of time. You
[0:56] have revealed all things to us, Lord,
[0:59] through the name of God revealed in
[1:01] these last days. How thankful we are,
[1:04] Lord, that we are your people. How
[1:06] grateful we are, Lord, for your
[1:08] revelation that you have sent in this
[1:10] day.
[1:12] We can never thank you enough, Father
[1:14] God, for the blood of Calvary, for
[1:17] washing our sin away, for bringing us
[1:20] true repentance by your word,
[1:24] and so much more, Lord.
[1:26] for the word that you sent by a humble
[1:28] prophet in this last day. Lord, he spoke
[1:33] amidst great persecution
[1:35] and turmoil and trouble. And even to
[1:39] this day, they are blackening his
[1:42] reputation
[1:43] and speaking against the word that was
[1:45] spoken. Yet he spoke with zeal and
[1:49] fervor and great inspiration,
[1:53] not even knowing those who would come
[1:56] and receive that word.
[1:59] He didn't even know us.
[2:01] He didn't even know who we would be and
[2:03] what our lives would be,
[2:06] Lord. But you put your spirit within him
[2:08] to speak the message, Lord, that has
[2:12] drawn us from all corners of the earth
[2:14] and brought us together and made us a
[2:16] family and made us friends, made us
[2:21] benefit from one another and given us
[2:24] joy and peace in our lives and
[2:27] transformed our families and took us out
[2:29] of the mess of this world.
[2:33] What a privilege it is, Lord. We are so
[2:36] thankful for the blood of Calvary and
[2:38] the message of the hour. Our lives are
[2:41] meaningless and empty without it, oh
[2:43] God. And we give you all the praise and
[2:45] the glory and the honor for it. Lord, we
[2:48] welcome you among us this morning.
[2:53] Lord, may you bless us today with your
[2:56] word. I'm just mortal man full of faults
[2:59] and failures and full of my own
[3:02] thoughts. Lord, I I ask you that you
[3:05] would purge my mind of all my own
[3:08] thoughts that your thoughts may be
[3:11] expressed to your people today. Bless
[3:14] the pastor and the people of this
[3:17] congregation.
[3:19] May this time that we spend together,
[3:21] Lord, be one step closer to that
[3:25] glorious translation,
[3:27] that glorious body change which this
[3:30] creature is groaning for. Father God,
[3:33] may you undertake for every need.
[3:37] Lord, we have a great task today. We
[3:40] have a a world that is teetering on the
[3:44] edge of
[3:46] destruction.
[3:48] People are succumbing to madness and
[3:52] strife and it looks like everything
[3:55] around us is they're losing their minds.
[3:58] They don't know what is reality anymore.
[4:01] It is becoming more and more difficult
[4:04] to
[4:06] get through to the spirit of man to
[4:08] change his mind about something to to
[4:12] let them see what reality and truth is.
[4:15] And yet in this time you have placed us
[4:21] Lord with your word. What can we do?
[4:24] What can we say? What can we teach that
[4:27] is so convincing that can permeate the
[4:30] hardened spirit of man? How can we
[4:33] change
[4:35] liberal and legal people, Lord, who have
[4:39] made up their minds about life and about
[4:42] marriage and about family and about
[4:44] politics and about God, about whether
[4:48] you exist or not? How can we change
[4:51] them? How can we affect them?
[4:54] Is our purpose, Lord, just to be a
[4:56] church that just keeps going on and on,
[4:58] having services and song specials and
[5:02] song services and prayer meetings, or is
[5:06] there something more that you want us to
[5:08] do? Is there something more that you
[5:11] have called us for? Is there something
[5:12] more that our lives are meant to
[5:15] achieve?
[5:17] Lord, we bring ourselves to you today
[5:19] willing to be instructed, willing to be
[5:23] taught, willing to be corrected, willing
[5:26] to be anointed of you. Lord God, we pray
[5:30] that you may bless all
[5:34] your children gathering in the different
[5:37] churches today in this country. All
[5:41] waiting to hear from you. all
[5:44] wanting to hear one word of life from
[5:47] you. We pray that you may anoint your
[5:49] bride this morning. Bless all the
[5:51] saints. Bless the saints back home
[5:54] in Durban, South Africa. Lord Jesus, may
[5:57] you be with our people as well. Father,
[6:00] we are truly thankful for you this this
[6:03] day and we ask you to be with us. Open
[6:05] up the scriptures to us. Open up your
[6:07] word. Lord, without your spirit, we
[6:10] cannot understand anything. and we
[6:12] depend upon you in all things. As we
[6:15] worship you now and submit and our souls
[6:19] bowing down before you, we welcome you
[6:22] among us. Speak, Lord, for we are
[6:25] willing to listen. We ask it in your
[6:28] precious name with thanksgiving and
[6:29] praise. Amen and amen.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:34] Amen. We like to greet you in the
[6:36] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[6:37] Jesus Christ. It's certainly good to be
[6:40] with you. I think that's what I was
[6:42] looking for.
[6:45] And um
[6:47] you may take your seats for a few
[6:48] minutes
[6:50] uh before we read the word of God.
[6:53] I just want to make sure I say all the
[6:55] relevant things.
[6:57] So, I just uh am so grateful to God to
[7:02] have this uh opportunity to be here with
[7:05] you once again and to uh share the word
[7:08] of God with you as he has um uh inspired
[7:13] us. You know, we we don't have anything
[7:15] new to say. Uh but we have something
[7:18] that God places on our heart that we can
[7:20] share with every one of you. And I know
[7:23] that each one of us has something to
[7:25] share. And that's why we're here today
[7:27] uh in this world in 2025. And God has
[7:31] anointed us. God has given us uh uh his
[7:35] word. He has anointed us with his
[7:37] spirit. He has given us revelation and
[7:39] understanding and uh we have a
[7:42] responsibility to it.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I just once again just happy to
[7:47] be here with you and good to see all of
[7:49] you again. I'm I'm thankful. Our brother
[7:51] Chad told me, "You know what? You're
[7:54] part of the furniture now. So there's no
[7:57] need for me to come before you, and I
[7:59] appreciate that. Makes me feel so much
[8:01] better." Amen. So I see a few years ago,
[8:05] it was 2022, I looked at the audience,
[8:07] and I could just see faces I I didn't
[8:09] know. Now it's all just friends. Amen.
[8:12] And I really certainly appreciate you.
[8:16] You know, it's uh it's always easier to
[8:20] preach to people who um know the word of
[8:24] God, who are well taught, people who are
[8:26] hungry for the word and um and I
[8:29] certainly appreciate your spirit and the
[8:31] worship uh always. It's really a
[8:34] blessing to me and I appreciate your
[8:36] pastor. He's a he's an inspiration
[8:40] uh not just to me but many people around
[8:42] the world and it's a it's a difficult
[8:45] time as I was praying there are many
[8:48] people in need people in the message um
[8:52] people um facing different trials you
[8:55] you you may not realize it um I must say
[8:59] Lima is a little bit of a utopia
[9:04] um I I mean if you come and live in our
[9:06] city. It's uh it's completely different.
[9:10] It's it's a rat race. It's uh so busy.
[9:14] The houses are all squashed nearby and
[9:17] uh you know it's there's crime. Uh here
[9:21] it looks like heaven.
[9:23] You're just driving through things are
[9:25] so peaceful.
[9:27] You know it's like I struggle to to find
[9:29] out how you people have desperation for
[9:32] the rapture.
[9:34] So,
[9:35] it's so calm. It's so peaceful. Time
[9:38] just goes by slowly. Uh, and the sun
[9:41] sets so late. You don't even know it's
[9:43] 9:00. It's 10:00. What's happening? And,
[9:47] uh, but with us, uh, even the birds
[9:49] remind us, go to sleep now. You know,
[9:51] it's, um, it's a different terrain and,
[9:54] uh, different, uh, places have different
[9:56] struggles and trials. I understand. And
[9:59] so, um, when I when I come here, it's
[10:02] it's always so relaxing and I certainly
[10:05] appreciate everything that you do. Um,
[10:08] so yeah, we appreciate the ministry here
[10:10] and all our friends and uh, and I
[10:13] consider you the family of God. So, the
[10:16] Lord bless you.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I want to um, let you stand
[10:22] again as we just read the word of God.
[10:26] Just want to make sure I
[10:28] I'm getting it right. Yeah.
[10:32] We're going to read from Hebrews chapter
[10:34] 9 and verse 8.
[10:37] Says, "The Holy Ghost, this signifying
[10:41] that the way into the holiest of all was
[10:45] not yet made manifest,
[10:47] while as the first tabernacle was yet
[10:51] standing." I'll read it again. the Holy
[10:54] Ghost. This signifying that the way into
[10:57] the holiest of all was not yet made
[11:01] manifest. While as the first tabernacle
[11:04] was yet standing, did you ever think
[11:06] that that's what the Holy Ghost was
[11:08] signifying?
[11:11] &gt;&gt; That the way into the holiest, Did the
[11:14] Holy Ghost make it known to us that the
[11:16] way into the holiest of all was not yet
[11:19] made manifest?
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. While as the first tabernacle was
[11:24] yet standing, in other words, it's
[11:25] telling us and it's pointing to that
[11:28] that the Holy Ghost that came in our
[11:30] day, it was actual proof to us that
[11:34] before the Holy Ghost came, there was no
[11:36] way into the holiest of holies.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; That tells us what the Holy Ghost
[11:41] truthfully is.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. You may be seated.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. So
[11:50] uh this is might terrify some of you for
[11:53] a little bit.
[11:55] I am going to take a subject called the
[11:57] Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost.
[12:01] Hold that thought. Let it digest and
[12:05] we're going to get through it. And for a
[12:07] title, the purposeful nature. Amen. So
[12:12] when we read this scripture,
[12:15] uh Paul tells us that the Holy Ghost
[12:18] coming after Christ proved to us that
[12:21] while the tabernacle of Moses was still
[12:23] in operation, the way into the holiest
[12:26] of holies was not yet revealed.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; It was not made known. There was no
[12:32] access.
[12:34] So the reason for me preaching um this
[12:38] subject this morning, you know, coming
[12:40] here, I tussled with it. I struggled
[12:43] with it right up to last night. I was
[12:46] should I, shouldn't I, you know, and and
[12:49] struggling through it and putting things
[12:51] in the right places, but I just couldn't
[12:53] get it out of me because I I've I've
[12:56] preached certain things uh in the recent
[13:00] years and I spoke about in different
[13:02] places. I spoke about the Holy Ghost,
[13:04] the types of the Holy Ghost when they
[13:06] came out of Egypt and the type of the
[13:07] Holy Ghost when they went into the
[13:09] promised land and how there was a an
[13:12] infancy baptism and then a mature
[13:15] baptism and the rolling away the
[13:17] reproach of of Egypt at Gilgal and
[13:20] showing the difference between the
[13:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost in Pentecost
[13:24] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[13:26] the seventh seal. And uh it you know I
[13:29] just expected people to say amen. We get
[13:33] that.
[13:35] And it seems like when you touch the
[13:37] Holy Ghost, it's a very sensitive spot
[13:40] for people. And um my main uh concern,
[13:46] well, you know, I say that it's my main
[13:48] concern. I mean, but who am I? I just
[13:50] feel like the Lord is feeling what is in
[13:54] the hearts of the people. And that's
[13:56] probably why it feels like it's my
[13:57] concern, you know. So I I keep hearing
[14:02] questions from the young people and as
[14:05] of lately from older people who I would
[14:08] have considered to have known where they
[14:10] stand uh saying, "Brother Alistister,
[14:13] how do I know I have the Holy Ghost? um
[14:17] how do I know whether
[14:20] you know whether I have the Holy Ghost
[14:22] from Pentecost or whether I had the Holy
[14:23] Ghost under the seventh seal? What am I
[14:26] supposed to be doing? Is there a
[14:27] difference? Am I supposed to be acting
[14:29] different? And so to me that is what I
[14:33] feel is something that should be um made
[14:37] clear and I I really care about the
[14:40] young people and I believe they are the
[14:42] church of tomorrow, the next generation.
[14:45] I also believe that when the word says
[14:47] we must keep his commandments, the word
[14:50] keep means to preserve, which means to
[14:54] pass it on.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how you preserve it. You
[14:58] make sure it goes to the next generation
[15:00] that it continues. Keep it for a
[15:02] perpetual covenant from for your
[15:04] children and your children's children
[15:05] and so on. So it really fails us if we
[15:10] become people who take an idea of the
[15:14] Holy Ghost given to us by Pentecost and
[15:17] then pass that down to our children and
[15:19] then we see it's ineffective.
[15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; And then what happens is our children
[15:23] meet people, they go to youth camps,
[15:24] they go to youth meetings and we find
[15:27] there's this tradition of trying to
[15:30] force young people to get something
[15:34] &gt;&gt; and they leave more confused. or they
[15:37] keep coming back and they are forced to
[15:39] be doing the same thing again and again.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; And uh I feel like being the bride of
[15:45] the Lord Jesus Christ there needs we
[15:47] need to be the people with direction
[15:50] &gt;&gt; with understanding. We need to be the
[15:52] people who can have a solid foundation
[15:54] to say this is what it is.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; And I'm not afraid to say what it is.
[15:59] And I'm I'm not hindered by somebody
[16:02] trying to make me feel inferior or
[16:05] somebody trying to make me feel like I
[16:07] don't know what I have. And so that is
[16:10] the reason why it's so impressing on me
[16:13] to make this clear to the bride of
[16:15] Christ and to let us know because this
[16:18] is something so personal to us. The Holy
[16:20] Spirit is something so personal to us.
[16:23] When you understand who he is, what it
[16:26] is, you wouldn't you wouldn't want to
[16:29] live a second without him.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; So, knowing this that the Holy Ghost
[16:35] signified
[16:37] that before
[16:39] Christ, the way to God was not made
[16:43] manifest. Well, that's simply telling us
[16:46] something important. The Holy Ghost has
[16:48] made the way possible.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Right? That's the first thing we need to
[16:52] know.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; To do what?
[16:55] Right? So, knowing this and that it made
[16:58] the way possible, it sparks so many
[17:00] questions. Questions that stem from the
[17:03] things we were previously taught of the
[17:05] Holy Ghost and things we have been uh we
[17:08] have heard since we came into the
[17:10] message.
[17:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I believe that uh the trouble
[17:14] in this subject can can come simply from
[17:17] trying to make sense of the scriptures
[17:20] and the message. And it's like if you've
[17:22] got these scriptures and the statements
[17:24] brother makes in the message like you
[17:26] got these uh uh the one quote way it
[17:29] says the dynamics is the Holy Spirit and
[17:32] look where that went to
[17:34] &gt;&gt; right the mechanics is this and the
[17:36] dynamics is the Holy Spirit and people
[17:38] took that and started teaching things
[17:40] and it expanded into people trying to
[17:43] express what they thought the dynamics
[17:45] is.
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; So I believe that the trouble comes from
[17:51] trying to make sense of the scriptures
[17:54] and the message and the statements.
[17:56] Well, that's the trouble with almost any
[17:58] subject,
[17:59] &gt;&gt; right? So we know that the prophet says
[18:02] that God interprets his own word. Now
[18:05] listen to the story. You know that,
[18:06] right? God is an interpreter of his own
[18:08] word. And there's an understanding to be
[18:10] had with this,
[18:12] &gt;&gt; right? Does this mean that we have
[18:14] nothing to say?
[18:16] that I'm just somebody who stands here
[18:18] and and like some supernatural being
[18:21] takes over me and God interprets his
[18:23] word like I'm not even conscious of what
[18:26] I'm saying or that u these hand gestures
[18:29] that I keep doing are him controlling me
[18:33] that he interprets his own word. No, he
[18:37] interprets his word within us. And
[18:39] here's the amazing thing that the
[18:40] scripture says that in the mouth of two
[18:43] or three
[18:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let it be established.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Why would he even do that? And it always
[18:49] worked that way. You you know the
[18:51] scripture that says where two or three
[18:53] are gathered in my name, there am I in
[18:56] their midst.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; You know what that means, right? That
[18:58] doesn't mean just because more than
[19:00] three are here that God is here. There
[19:02] are many people who are gathering in in
[19:04] the name of Jesus Christ and God is not
[19:06] there.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; That's not what it means. That scripture
[19:09] specifically means that anything is
[19:12] established as long as two or three in
[19:15] with the spirit of God agree on it.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Right from the law right through that's
[19:21] what it means. Let u by by the witness
[19:24] of two or three let it be established.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; Now why would he do that?
[19:30] &gt;&gt; Why would there have to be two or three?
[19:31] What's wrong with just having one person
[19:33] who has the Holy Ghost say something and
[19:36] because the Holy Ghost said it, let it
[19:38] be established.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Because to people there needs to be a
[19:41] witness of two or three to see that they
[19:44] are seeing the same thing. Therefore,
[19:45] they can believe it.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; And that in itself is showing us that it
[19:49] is not a foolproof way. Foolproof,
[19:52] terrible word,
[19:54] right?
[19:56] Men can men can so easily get people to
[20:00] follow their own interpretation.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; So if let's look at it this way. If two
[20:04] or three people agree on the wrong thing
[20:08] &gt;&gt; and say they have the Holy Ghost
[20:11] &gt;&gt; then because the church has manipulated
[20:13] that law
[20:14] &gt;&gt; it's established.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[20:17] &gt;&gt; This is why I say it isn't foolproof.
[20:20] And yet God instituted it that way.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Right? So the way it works says is if a
[20:26] man has the Holy Ghost then he has the
[20:29] witness in himself. Amen. That the word
[20:32] spoken by the preacher was interpreted
[20:35] by God or not. Which then happens to you
[20:38] when you hear the preacher speaking. You
[20:41] have a witness in yourself and you hear
[20:43] that word and you decide based on what
[20:46] he's telling you to say amen or not.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Right? So the Holy Ghost then settles
[20:53] the word in that man and makes him say
[20:56] amen to the to the confirming of the
[20:59] interpretation of the word.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; That is God being his own interpreter.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[21:05] &gt;&gt; True.
[21:06] &gt;&gt; Right. Not
[21:07] &gt;&gt; and this is why we get so uh criticized
[21:11] when we say something because some
[21:14] people are going to doubt now. Is he
[21:16] saying that with the Holy Spirit? Is he
[21:19] interpreting that by himself? opposite
[21:20] his own thoughts, own interpretation.
[21:23] The only way it can be established is if
[21:25] you have the Holy Spirit and you can say
[21:28] amen to that
[21:30] &gt;&gt; and then when there's more than one that
[21:33] have the Holy Spirit that say amen to
[21:35] it, then what was said is established.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; If a man does not have the Holy Ghost,
[21:41] it will be the opposite. or he may
[21:44] choose to believe it and say amen based
[21:47] on his understanding because he's saying
[21:49] amen because it's a church tradition and
[21:52] he says amen because it makes sense to
[21:54] him. Not necessarily that the Holy
[21:57] Spirit confirmed that.
[21:59] &gt;&gt; Do you see how precarious this is?
[22:02] &gt;&gt; How dangerous it is and how this has
[22:04] been passed down for generations. People
[22:06] saying amen because it makes sense.
[22:08] People saying amen because they like it.
[22:10] People say amen because it's convenient.
[22:13] But there needs to be this is the
[22:15] purpose or the reason why it's crucial
[22:17] that we all have the Holy Spirit
[22:20] &gt;&gt; because then things can actually be
[22:22] established.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; Properly established.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. So true believers
[22:29] have to stay as true to the word as they
[22:32] can. And that's what we're coming to in
[22:35] this little subject. And we've got to
[22:37] believe that God will interpret his word
[22:39] within them. We literally walk around by
[22:42] faith. I greet you. I shake your hand.
[22:45] You shake my hand. You say, "God bless
[22:46] you, brother. We fellowship together."
[22:48] Sometimes we fellowship together to test
[22:50] each other, right? You know, are we on
[22:53] the same page? Do we have the same
[22:55] spirit? We're testing each other all the
[22:57] time. But it it makes fellowship so
[23:00] sweet, so beautiful when our spirits
[23:02] connect.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you know that um you are first
[23:07] a spiritual being before you are a
[23:09] natural? So like when you're walking
[23:11] towards somebody and before they even
[23:14] speak a word, before you shake hands,
[23:16] you already your spirits have already
[23:17] connected.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; As he's coming towards say, "Oh, he's
[23:21] having a bad day.
[23:24] &gt;&gt; You already know you he's not happy to
[23:26] see me right now. He'd rather not be
[23:28] here." And then you shake hands and you
[23:29] both say, "God bless you, brother."
[23:33] But your spirits are already connected
[23:35] &gt;&gt; and already communicated and your body's
[23:38] just acting out something for the sake
[23:40] of peace or something. But this is this
[23:42] is exactly what happens. So without the
[23:45] Holy Spirit between two people, there
[23:48] can never really be peace.
[23:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the other thing. It is
[23:52] the peace of God.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's move on. So when we
[23:57] look at the scriptures on the Holy
[23:58] Ghost, as we approach the subject, we
[24:01] must realize that we are stepping into
[24:03] dangerous territory. I like dangerous
[24:05] territory because I like that God can
[24:08] lead us through it.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm not afraid of it,
[24:11] especially in a day like this. But the
[24:14] carefulness that is needed is where we
[24:16] need the guide,
[24:18] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit. We also have to bear in
[24:20] mind that you know when we are speaking
[24:23] of this you know peoples of the world
[24:25] have been delving into this mystery long
[24:28] before any of us were born
[24:31] right we literally are Johnny come
[24:33] lately no offense to any Johnny's around
[24:36] &gt;&gt; right but we are literally I I didn't
[24:38] make up these phrases brother Johnny
[24:41] that's what they call the Johnny come
[24:43] lately we have just arrived yet there
[24:46] are people who have lived through the
[24:49] the the seven church ages, the time when
[24:51] the Holy Ghost poured out. Before that,
[24:54] there were the the great prophets and
[24:56] sages and they lived through this time.
[24:58] They studied it. They asked the
[25:00] questions. They wrote things. We've we
[25:02] are we are arriving here and
[25:04] piggybacking of what those people have
[25:06] been through.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:08] &gt;&gt; And and sometimes it's so, you know,
[25:11] amazing for me when I when I listen to
[25:13] ministers who who stand there so
[25:16] aggressively saying this is what it is.
[25:18] And there's no other way but the way I
[25:19] have said it and yet there are thousands
[25:22] of generations of people who brought it
[25:24] up for you to receive it today.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Let's be cognizant of that. Amen.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; So most ancient religions have believed
[25:33] in the spirit of God.
[25:37] &gt;&gt; Do you know that?
[25:38] &gt;&gt; And they believe the spirit of God is
[25:42] invisible like the wind.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Right? Some people believe the wind when
[25:47] it blows is the breath of God.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the beliefs come from watching
[25:54] babies being born. Why? Because a baby's
[25:57] born and he's struggling. And as soon as
[25:59] the breath comes in, they believe
[26:01] the breath of God has given him life.
[26:04] And so they literally believe it's
[26:06] breath, right? And people dying breathe
[26:10] their last breath and the and and the
[26:14] life is gone. and how babies suck in
[26:17] their first breath and how a dying
[26:18] person exhales the last one. Most
[26:22] religious people believe that it is the
[26:24] Holy Ghost in the person's spirit given
[26:27] by God entering or exiting the body. I
[26:31] think I might have told you before it
[26:32] leads to all kinds of things like when
[26:35] people sneeze and the old English
[26:37] traditions where the you know the spirit
[26:39] comes out and that's why you say bless
[26:41] you because the enemy can catch and then
[26:44] comes back in
[26:46] &gt;&gt; right you know that
[26:47] &gt;&gt; gaze
[26:50] &gt;&gt; bless you good health gaze in the German
[26:54] uh so now by uh us understanding what
[26:58] the holy spirit is we can put aside all
[27:00] the confusion about this, right? Because
[27:03] it's it's more than that.
[27:05] &gt;&gt; It signifies the entering into the
[27:07] holiest of holies.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; So all scriptures like and think of it.
[27:13] You say, "Okay, brother, th those are
[27:15] you know those are the religions of of
[27:17] other or beliefs of other religions. But
[27:20] what about us? What about Christianity?
[27:22] What about the Jews?" Yes, the Jews as
[27:24] well, right? You know from the
[27:26] scriptures, God blew into Adam's
[27:28] nostrils,
[27:30] the breath of life and man became a
[27:32] living soul or the Lord Jesus blowing on
[27:35] them and they receiving the Holy Ghost,
[27:38] right? And so
[27:40] I don't know if you've ever seen I had a
[27:42] cousin in South Africa. Uh I probably
[27:46] have a cousin. I haven't heard of her in
[27:47] a while.
[27:49] But they uh um they were in the they
[27:52] were denominational in in the Beni Hinn
[27:54] meetings that came into South Africa.
[27:56] And so Beni Hinn had this thing, you
[27:58] know, he would he the choir would be
[28:01] there and people would be there and he
[28:02] would go and they'd all fall down
[28:05] &gt;&gt; or wave his coat and they all fall down
[28:07] and would tell me he's so anointed, you
[28:10] know. But of course we know what it is.
[28:11] the first person falls down and pushes
[28:13] all the others, but they feel it's
[28:15] powerful
[28:16] &gt;&gt; and he's he his breath he's blowing. And
[28:19] then you'd have these fellows like
[28:21] Kenneth Hagen and these men would would
[28:24] uh walk through the crowds and blow on
[28:27] people and they just fall down or they
[28:28] start laughing hysterically,
[28:31] right? You probably seen more of that
[28:32] than I have. Um but this is where all
[28:36] these things come from because Christ
[28:38] blew on them and they received the Holy
[28:39] Ghost. Well, then we can blow on people
[28:41] and they receive the Holy Ghost. But
[28:44] we've never seen the prophet of the hour
[28:46] do that.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:49] &gt;&gt; You can see how then these scriptures
[28:51] are so misinterpreted.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; And be careful people when you start
[28:55] seeing people in the message start
[28:57] taking on these dangerous things that
[29:00] have got zero to do with what the Holy
[29:02] Ghost really is.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. So by that statement you can
[29:08] gather that it is important to
[29:09] understand that the understand the
[29:12] godhead to fully understand the Holy
[29:14] Ghost. We will incorporate this into
[29:16] what we're going to be touching on
[29:18] today. Blowing upon people no that's not
[29:21] it. That's not what brings the Holy
[29:23] Ghost. So probably the most important
[29:27] answer on the Holy Ghost that people are
[29:29] looking for today is
[29:32] brother, how are we supposed to receive
[29:34] it?
[29:36] Right? And the other question um that
[29:40] people are asking and looking for an
[29:42] answer is how do I know that I have it?
[29:46] Right? So many people don't want to
[29:49] spend the time knowing what it is. They
[29:53] just want to get it and be done with it
[29:55] and receive all the benefits and proceed
[29:57] further. Right? And it doesn't work like
[30:00] that. Then many people have convinced
[30:02] themselves that they have it based that
[30:05] I have the Holy Ghost brother. I know I
[30:07] have the Holy Ghost. And how do you
[30:08] know? Because I had an experience.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; You've heard that too.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; And uh then later things happen and then
[30:16] they doubt whether they had the
[30:17] experience,
[30:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[30:19] &gt;&gt; Or what experience it was. So let's
[30:22] consider what the prophet says and to me
[30:24] this is my favorite quote on the Holy
[30:27] Ghost on receiving the Holy Ghost. Uh I
[30:31] remember as a young minister this I I
[30:33] don't know how many colors I I uh u
[30:36] mocked this with and memorized it and
[30:40] every time I spoke about it this is the
[30:42] most important one. It's on I think it's
[30:44] page six paragraph 22. Are you with us?
[30:47] Amen.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Upon this place, we wish to approach the
[30:51] subject which I think is the outstanding
[30:53] subject of today of the what is the Holy
[30:57] Spirit? What is it? And now the reason
[31:00] I've taken the subject in line like
[31:02] this, you cannot come, are you
[31:04] listening? You cannot come and receive
[31:06] the Holy Spirit unless you know what it
[31:10] is.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; First requirement.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:12] &gt;&gt; And you cannot receive it if you know
[31:15] what it is.
[31:17] unless you believe it's given to you and
[31:21] it's for you.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; And then number three, you cannot know
[31:26] whether you've got it or not unless you
[31:29] know what results it brings.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; And this is my favorite statement. So if
[31:35] you know what it is and who it's to and
[31:38] what action it brings when it comes,
[31:41] then you know what you've got when you
[31:43] get it.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is. That's just would
[31:47] settle it. And it's like, it's like the
[31:49] prophet says, it's like, "Yeah, now we
[31:52] can close up and go home."
[31:54] Right? If you know what it is, you
[31:57] believe it's given to you, and it's for
[31:59] you, and you know what results it
[32:01] brings, then you know what you've got
[32:03] when you get it.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we need to break that down.
[32:08] And of course, the problem is when
[32:10] people believe uh and today when it's
[32:13] taught to people that this is what the
[32:14] Holy Ghost is, they teach what it was.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; And then the results they want is what
[32:22] it used to bring.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:26] &gt;&gt; Amenise.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; So, we are going to base this entire
[32:30] study on this little bit of advice from
[32:32] the prophet. What is the Holy Ghost?
[32:35] Believe that it's given for me. believe
[32:37] that it's for me. This is a very
[32:39] important state that it's for me. I am
[32:42] not Peter
[32:45] from 2,000 years ago.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not a fisherman.
[32:49] &gt;&gt; I'm not someone who doesn't have the
[32:51] message of the hour.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:56] &gt;&gt; So, what is it for me?
[32:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you want to really get a
[33:02] full understanding, you have to explore
[33:03] the scriptures and the message to
[33:05] fulfill these four things. I just want
[33:07] to highlight some important things. Do
[33:09] you love the scripture?
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Do you love Bible study?
[33:12] &gt;&gt; I love it. It's like, you know, rub my
[33:14] hands together, settle myself in my seat
[33:16] and start enjoying it and gets the
[33:19] gastric juices flowing and
[33:21] &gt;&gt; digestion and everything happening.
[33:23] Amen. Spiritually, of course.
[33:25] So I want to highlight some important
[33:27] things that may add more light to the
[33:29] question. What is the Holy Ghost? And
[33:31] brother Baron preached a message on it
[33:33] which I believe many of you have read.
[33:35] And if you haven't, you must read it.
[33:37] What is the Holy Ghost? And in there he
[33:39] covers things that a well-taught
[33:41] Christian or a Pentecostal would
[33:43] understand.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Someone from the Pentecostal age and and
[33:46] a Pentecostal would read that message.
[33:48] What is the Holy Ghost and say, "Yeah, I
[33:50] agree with everything. It's it sounds
[33:52] right round about what we believe. But
[33:56] we are not a part of the Pentecostal
[33:57] age." Amen.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; And you shouldn't take it for granted
[34:00] that everyone is well and sufficiently
[34:03] taught on it,
[34:04] &gt;&gt; right? You owe it to yourself to take it
[34:06] slow and search through the word. Do you
[34:09] love him, saints?
[34:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, coming back to religions of
[34:13] the earth, we must admit then when we
[34:16] think of the Holy Spirit, now I'm going
[34:18] to start talking about it and and then
[34:21] uh I don't want you to get confused. I
[34:22] want you to stay with me.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost,
[34:27] right? I'm speaking of it as if they are
[34:29] two different things
[34:30] &gt;&gt; for a reason. And so we have a
[34:33] preconceived idea of it and yet we don't
[34:36] know where it came from. We just read in
[34:38] the Bible, Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost, and
[34:41] we got so used to it because we're
[34:42] Christians and because we're message
[34:44] believers, we don't take long enough to
[34:46] consider they were written that way for
[34:49] a specific reason by people over a
[34:52] thousand years ago who thought it's
[34:54] significant to write it differently.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Right? So there are basically a few
[35:02] Abrahamic religions as the world calls
[35:05] it. The big three are Judaism,
[35:07] Christianity and Islam. Then there's
[35:10] also bahayism and to a certain extent
[35:13] babism that are offshoots of Islam and
[35:17] that are sort of draw also from Judaism.
[35:20] Right? Have you heard of those? Mostly
[35:22] uh they are mixed with pagan beliefs of
[35:24] uh Persia and Africa. The basis of these
[35:27] religions is this that there is one God
[35:31] who revealed his name Yahweh to Abraham.
[35:37] Amen. And uh Abraham's people and they
[35:40] all believe in prophets and the constant
[35:43] belief is that the Holy Spirit is what
[35:47] God put on the prophets.
[35:51] They believe this long before the Holy
[35:52] Ghost came to us, right? long before
[35:56] they believed that when a prophet came,
[35:58] it was the spirit of God upon the
[36:01] prophet.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. What What am I saying to you? This
[36:05] is a belief that the Jews had. This is a
[36:07] belief that Christians had. This is a
[36:09] belief that Islam has.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Right? This is a belief that uh these
[36:14] bahayas people, Bahayism and Babism also
[36:18] have. Now looking at that alone, is it
[36:21] not similar to what we believe and why
[36:24] we can so easily accept that God spoke
[36:27] through brother Brandham because God's
[36:29] spirit was in him.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; You're basically believing the same
[36:33] thing as other people, other religions.
[36:36] He's got this I know if you if you um
[36:38] ever meet Hindu people and if you've
[36:40] ever seen what they call the trance and
[36:43] where they stick hooks in them and pull
[36:45] carriages and when that person gets the
[36:48] trance and and they believe they will
[36:50] tell you he's got the god on him. He's
[36:53] got the spirit of the god on him. To be
[36:56] able to do that it has to take the
[36:58] spirit of the god to be on him. All
[37:00] right. So I want to show you this
[37:02] scripture from Numbers 11 29. And Moses
[37:06] said unto him, "Enviousest thou for my
[37:09] sake would God that all the Lord's
[37:12] people were prophets and that the Lord
[37:15] would put his spirit upon them?"
[37:18] You know, it's not in my notes, but it's
[37:21] it's quite significant. He didn't say
[37:24] the Lord will put his spirit upon the
[37:26] people and make them prophets.
[37:29] Yeah.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; He said
[37:31] would to God that all the Lord's people
[37:34] were prophets and that the Lord would
[37:36] put his spirit upon them.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; You can be a prophet without the spirit
[37:40] of the Lord because a prophet is a gift,
[37:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[37:43] &gt;&gt; But it's he's pointing out for some
[37:46] reason is is an accepted thing of uh to
[37:49] earth's people from the old days that
[37:51] the spirit of God could come upon man.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:56] from that. I just want to take that
[37:58] point that the Lord would put his spirit
[38:01] upon them. Can you see how far back the
[38:04] book of numbers
[38:05] &gt;&gt; we have a scripture that that confirms
[38:07] to us that God can put his spirit upon
[38:11] man,
[38:13] &gt;&gt; right? That's our foundation. And
[38:15] brother Maram is absolutely correct in
[38:17] that it is so easy to confuse the
[38:20] actions of the Holy Spirit
[38:22] &gt;&gt; because how do you know whether it is
[38:24] the spirit of God upon them? They're
[38:27] prophets. There are prophets. There is a
[38:29] prophet like Balum who brother Bam said
[38:32] was a true prophet
[38:34] &gt;&gt; because when he prophesied what he
[38:35] prophesied came true
[38:37] &gt;&gt; was a true prophet.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; But it was also a false prophet.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:44] So this is why with the with the gift of
[38:47] prophecy, you can have someone with the
[38:48] gift of prophecy and they may not have
[38:50] the spirit of God on them.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; So the only sort of proof we have of
[38:56] this is where the Bible speaks
[38:58] specifically of the Holy Spirit and the
[39:00] Holy Ghost. The the four the scriptures
[39:02] we are going to go through um for now we
[39:05] we we want to glance at them. We want to
[39:06] draw a few conclusions and we want to
[39:08] discuss this. So where this uh came from
[39:12] for me was um many years ago, I would
[39:15] say over 10 years ago, I had a young
[39:17] person who who asked me the question,
[39:20] "Brother Al, is the is the Holy Spirit
[39:22] and the Holy Ghost the same?" And I
[39:24] thought, "Wow, I never thought about
[39:26] that." Uh because just like any normal
[39:29] message believer, I brother Brandham
[39:32] uses it interchangeably,
[39:34] you know, and uh I just assume they
[39:36] Yeah, they are the same. But obviously
[39:38] the reason there's something in this
[39:40] person's heart that that they were
[39:42] looking for and I take questions very
[39:44] seriously. So I said you know let me go
[39:46] and study and of course I came back with
[39:48] an answer that nobody really likes. The
[39:51] you know I said the truth is they are
[39:54] the same and yet not the same. And you
[39:57] know, message believers be like, "Dear
[39:59] Lord, can't anything in the word just be
[40:01] straightforward just for once?" You
[40:03] know, so let's just get this straight
[40:07] from the outset.
[40:09] Things are only that complicated because
[40:11] of what man does,
[40:14] &gt;&gt; right? It's complicated because the
[40:16] scriptures were written in Hebrew and
[40:18] Chaldian and Aramaic or coin of Greek
[40:21] and and then it was translated into
[40:23] English and here we are and you don't
[40:25] even speak English you speak American
[40:28] you know and then you're you're trying
[40:30] to uh translate it from the English
[40:33] you're trying to translate it from
[40:34] you're trying to understand different
[40:36] interpretations you know and and so it
[40:40] how do we know we are speaking exactly
[40:42] what was written without the Holy
[40:44] spirit. How are we ever going to get the
[40:46] correct interpretation?
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. So things are only complicated
[40:52] because of what man has done. God did
[40:54] not complicate anything.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; So what we are doing is undoing
[40:59] what has been misinterpreted.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; That's what we want to do. What has been
[41:04] misplaced and dislocated for many many
[41:07] years. So how is the Holy Spirit and the
[41:09] Holy Ghost the same and yet not the
[41:12] same? Some of you will be saying,
[41:13] "Brother Alistister, you're just making
[41:15] things up. You're not saying what
[41:16] Brother Brandon says." Stop it. Okay,
[41:20] let me give you an idea. You all ready
[41:22] for this?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Okay. Is the father and the son the
[41:27] same?
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Now, if you There's a scripture that
[41:33] says, "He that hath the father hath the
[41:35] son also."
[41:37] &gt;&gt; He that loveth the father loveth the son
[41:39] also.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Is the father and the son the same?
[41:42] There's my answer. Yes and no.
[41:46] Right? Like a good extrinitarian, you
[41:48] will say, "But hold on, brother Al.
[41:50] Those are two different attributes." You
[41:52] know, one is an attribute of father,
[41:54] attribute of son. I can see you've been
[41:56] through message university
[41:58] with the Holy Ghost. Brother Al, you're
[42:00] talking about the same thing. The Holy
[42:01] Ghost and the Holy Spirit. It's not a
[42:03] different person in the Godhead. It's
[42:05] the same thing, just different words.
[42:07] Okay. Uh same person. Okay. Uh, is the
[42:11] word and Jesus the same?
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Yes and no.
[42:18] &gt;&gt; Because before he was Jesus, he was the
[42:20] word. And when he was the word, he was
[42:22] not known as Jesus. He became the word
[42:24] made flesh. And that's when the word was
[42:26] known as Jesus.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Right? And right now, we have Jesus as
[42:31] the word living within us.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; But it's not Jesus in the flesh from
[42:36] 2,000 years ago literally inhabiting my
[42:39] being.
[42:40] And then I am becoming him.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; And yet my name is Alistister.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; So am I Jesus made flesh? Yes. Am I
[42:49] Jesus? Yes and no.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; See uh you can glorify God in me but you
[42:58] can't glorify me.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; You can worship God in me but you can't
[43:02] worship me.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; Right? And Jesus himself says I I come
[43:07] to do the works of my father. Do not
[43:09] judge me for anything else but for those
[43:11] work's sake. If you see in me, you've
[43:12] seen the father. And then he says,
[43:14] glorify God.
[43:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; So how how about that? Jesus came and he
[43:25] was the word. But before Jesus came, the
[43:28] word was not known as Jesus. In the same
[43:30] way, before it was called the Holy
[43:33] Ghost, it was called the Holy Spirit.
[43:38] That's right.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; All we need to do is understand what the
[43:40] difference is.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; It is the same and it is not the same.
[43:44] Why did the writers write it
[43:46] differently? So what makes it the same
[43:48] and not the same? The manifestation.
[43:53] That's all the manifestation of the word
[43:55] in Abraham's day. The manifestation of
[43:57] the word in Jesus Christ. Different
[44:00] manifestation.
[44:02] Amen. That's all that happened. So let's
[44:04] let's understand. Let's look at the
[44:06] manifestations. If you really want to
[44:07] know what it is, you have to study the
[44:09] manifestations from the beginning all
[44:12] the way through to the end to understand
[44:14] what this really is. So, let's make a
[44:16] few important observations. Are you
[44:18] still with me?
[44:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:19] &gt;&gt; The phrase Holy Spirit only occurs in
[44:23] the Bible seven times. Three times in
[44:26] the Old Testament, four times in the New
[44:28] Testament. The the phrase Holy Ghost
[44:32] appears 89 times in the Bible and never
[44:35] in the Old Testament.
[44:39] Spirit of God appears 26 times in the
[44:43] Bible, 14 times in the Old Testament,
[44:45] and 12 times in the New Testament. So
[44:48] these men who were inspired by the same
[44:52] Holy Ghost
[44:54] wrote it differently. If it was all the
[44:57] same, why not just use Holy Ghost from
[45:00] the beginning? Why not just use Holy
[45:02] Spirit throughout? Why make it
[45:05] differentiation,
[45:07] &gt;&gt; right? What is the point of these
[45:09] observations? Maybe it's just the way
[45:11] the interpreters of the original script
[45:13] chose to print it. That would be true,
[45:15] but for a few exceptions. So, I'm going
[45:17] to show you this. John 7 and verse 39
[45:20] says, "But this spake he of the spirit
[45:24] which they believe on him should
[45:25] receive. They that believe in him should
[45:26] receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet
[45:29] given because that Jesus was not yet
[45:32] glorified.
[45:34] Right? Now you know the religious
[45:36] message people would say just say what
[45:37] it says. But what does it mean? Right?
[45:41] Anyone with a brain will tell you it's
[45:44] basically saying the Holy Ghost was not
[45:45] yet given until Jesus was glorified.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; So it's telling you the Holy Ghost came
[45:50] after Jesus,
[45:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[45:55] At first, this lets us know the Holy
[45:57] Ghost only came after Jesus.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; And the the people who were interpreting
[46:03] it into English, this the reason they
[46:05] chose to write Holy Ghost after Jesus.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; There's a scripture telling us that
[46:11] because that Jesus was not yet
[46:12] glorified. The Holy Ghost was not yet
[46:15] given. So what did David have?
[46:19] &gt;&gt; What did Moses have? What did Jonah
[46:22] have? What did all those men of the Old
[46:24] Testament? Did they not have the Holy
[46:26] Ghost?
[46:29] Right? Let's go to Psalm 51:1.
[46:33] This is David, the one we were just
[46:34] talking about. He says, "Cast me not
[46:36] away from thy presence and take not thy
[46:38] Holy Spirit from me." So for those
[46:41] people who said, "Well, the Holy Ghost
[46:42] was not yet given." So that's why David
[46:45] and all of them did not have the Holy
[46:47] Ghost, right? So what did they have? And
[46:50] here we have a scripture telling us that
[46:52] David had something
[46:54] &gt;&gt; because he's saying don't take it from
[46:57] me.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Meaning he had it
[46:59] &gt;&gt; and listen this is happening after he
[47:01] committed adultery.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; The reason I'm saying this is because we
[47:08] have other interpretations of the Holy
[47:10] Spirit like saying if you have mistakes
[47:12] you don't have the Holy Spirit.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; The man had he committed adultery and
[47:17] he's saying don't take the Holy Spirit
[47:19] from me. Yeah. Yeah.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; He committed adultery. He was made he
[47:23] the the prophet made him know he was a
[47:26] sinner. He was a murderer and he was an
[47:28] adulterer. And he's not saying I've lost
[47:30] the Holy Ghost. I've lost the Holy
[47:32] Spirit. He said, "Don't take it from
[47:33] me."
[47:37] &gt;&gt; So, we judge one another by the mistakes
[47:40] we make. And we say, "Well, if you have
[47:42] the Holy Spirit, you won't do that. If
[47:44] you have the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't
[47:45] have done that. You The Holy Spirit has
[47:47] got nothing to do with that. All right.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to understand.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, here David speaks as if the
[47:57] Holy Spirit was with him. If you're
[47:59] confused a little bit or you pushing
[48:01] back a little bit, just wait on him.
[48:03] We're going to enjoy this journey
[48:04] together.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Believe me.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; So, what did David have if the Holy
[48:10] Ghost was not yet given? Right? Mark 12.
[48:13] For David himself, now we've got in
[48:15] Mark, it's translated into English and
[48:18] it's speaking about David. For for David
[48:20] himself said by the Holy Ghost,
[48:25] the Lord said to my Lord, "Sit thou at
[48:27] my right hand till I make thine enemies
[48:29] thy foottool."
[48:30] Oh,
[48:32] &gt;&gt; right. First, the Holy Ghost was not yet
[48:35] given until Jesus was glorified. Now,
[48:38] we're saying David was speaking by the
[48:40] Holy Ghost.
[48:43] Amen. I love it when it gets more
[48:45] confusing
[48:48] because then we know it's a real
[48:49] revelation to us. Amen.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; So, David says this by the Holy Ghost.
[48:53] How could how could it not have been
[48:55] given them? Isaiah 63:10
[48:58] um and 11, but they rebelled and vexed
[49:01] his holy spirit. Therefore, he was
[49:03] turned to be their enemy. He fought
[49:06] against them. This is speaking of the
[49:08] Holy Spirit with the nation of Israel.
[49:10] And verse 11 says, "Then he remembered
[49:12] the days of Moses of old Moses and his
[49:15] people, saying, where is he that bought
[49:19] uh brought them out of the sea uh with
[49:22] the shepherd of his flock? Where is he
[49:24] that put his holy spirit within him?"
[49:28] &gt;&gt; So what we have is it looks like the
[49:30] Holy Spirit was within Moses
[49:33] &gt;&gt; as the Holy Spirit was within David,
[49:37] &gt;&gt; right? So did the Old Testament saints
[49:39] have the Holy Spirit or the Holy Ghost?
[49:42] Because we see that we see the words
[49:44] Holy Spirit in the Old Testament, but we
[49:46] see the Holy Ghost only in the New
[49:48] Testament. Right? If it was the same,
[49:52] you say, "No, brother, it's the same."
[49:54] And you have all the, you know, the
[49:55] people uh who are who get zealous about
[49:58] it and who believe that if they shout
[49:59] louder and scream louder and faint
[50:01] harder, then they have it, you know. No,
[50:04] IT'S THE SAME. IT'S THE SAME. OKAY. So
[50:07] why did the Old Testament saints not
[50:09] speak with tongues
[50:11] &gt;&gt; and get slain in the spirit or have
[50:14] healing campaigns and jump around and
[50:17] scream and shout and have church?
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Why do they act so different? Why were
[50:22] there no altar calls in Moses day? Why
[50:25] do they not go out and same Holy Spirit
[50:28] you say? Why do they not act the same?
[50:31] Why do we want to make or define the
[50:33] Holy Ghost of this day only as this?
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Right? Why do they have to be the same
[50:41] Holy Spirit inspire them to be deathly
[50:43] silent in the tabernacle? Speak one word
[50:46] and you die.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Now you can shout, scream, and hip hip
[50:50] hooray and run around screaming and act
[50:53] all disorderly and claim to have the
[50:54] Holy Spirit. But in the Old Testament,
[50:57] you try that. You wouldn't even make it
[51:00] one foot forward. You'd be dead.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Same Holy Spirit.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; So, was it the Holy Spirit in the
[51:08] saints, on the saints, or not? What is
[51:11] the difference? Amen. You see, when you
[51:14] look at it and you ask questions, you
[51:16] start to see it. Why? Because the
[51:18] answers are in your heart. Amen. So even
[51:21] in the New Testament, it speaks as if
[51:24] God was still going to give the Holy
[51:27] Spirit to the New Testament people,
[51:29] right? Let's go to Luke 11:13.
[51:33] If you then being evil know how to give
[51:36] good gifts unto your children, how much
[51:39] more shall your heavenly father give the
[51:42] Holy Spirit to them that ask him? So it
[51:45] looks like God is willing to give the
[51:47] Holy Spirit to the New Testament saints,
[51:50] right? Ephesians 1:13 says, "In whom you
[51:53] also trusted after that you heard the
[51:55] word of truth, the gospel of your
[51:57] salvation. In whom also after that you
[51:59] believed, you were sealed with that Holy
[52:02] Spirit of promise."
[52:05] Now we're seeing it in the New
[52:06] Testament. It's not just um we see this
[52:09] in Luke 11 and also in Ephesians which
[52:12] is after Christ is glorified. We see the
[52:15] promise that he wants to give his holy
[52:18] spirit to the Gentiles.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Clearly the Gentiles did not have the
[52:24] holy spirit. Now we thought that a lot
[52:28] of people say the Holy Ghost sealed us,
[52:32] right? And here the scriptures say you
[52:33] are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God
[52:35] till the day of your redemption. There's
[52:37] a significant difference then. We're
[52:39] going to talk about that too, right? 1
[52:41] Thessalonians 4:8.
[52:43] He therefore that despiseth despiseth
[52:46] not man, but God, who hath also given
[52:49] unto us his holy spirit.
[52:53] Amen.
[52:55] Do you have the Holy Spirit or not? How
[52:57] do you know? So yet again, it seems like
[53:00] the two are the same. Yet there are
[53:02] scriptures that said the Holy Ghost is
[53:04] not given before Christ. How can that be
[53:07] if some whole Old Testament saints also
[53:10] had the Holy Ghost? Right? Look at this
[53:13] one. Also another scripture that speaks
[53:16] about uh something that happened before
[53:19] Christ was glorified. Are you still with
[53:21] me?
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Matthew 1:18. Now the birth of Jesus
[53:24] Christ was on this wise when as his
[53:26] mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[53:28] before they came together she was found
[53:30] with child of the Holy Ghost.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; This is before Acts chapter 2. You can
[53:38] so easily say well look Mary had the
[53:40] Holy Ghost. It doesn't say that. It says
[53:43] she was found with child of the Holy
[53:45] Ghost.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Right? So you agree there's a lot we
[53:48] need to understand. Let's not take it
[53:50] for granted. If you know what it is, if
[53:53] you believe what it or that it's given
[53:55] for you and it is for you and you know
[53:57] what results it brings, then you know
[53:58] what you got when you get it.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; So Mary was obviously before Christ came
[54:05] uh and she received the Holy Ghost to
[54:08] conceive Christ.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; Without the Holy Ghost, she could not
[54:13] conceive Christ.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost was necessary for her to
[54:17] conceive.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Right. These are all these little
[54:19] beautiful clues. So we could debate many
[54:22] uh about many things. Uh but the
[54:24] simplicity of it is the father is a
[54:28] spirit.
[54:29] What does it even mean? The father is
[54:31] not a separate person. The father is a
[54:33] word that describes a relationship of
[54:35] God to man before Christ came.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Right? So is the father not a holy
[54:42] spirit?
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Look at our understanding. We're saying
[54:46] what is a holy spirit to you and I? Holy
[54:48] means he's got no sin. There's no dirt.
[54:52] There's no filth. There's no uh shame.
[54:55] There's no guilt. He's holy. He's pious.
[54:58] He's uh No, that's not what it is,
[55:02] right? Holy Spirit. So, the Holy Spirit
[55:06] or Holy Ghost is always about God's
[55:10] spirit upon or in man.
[55:16] The Holy Spirit has got to do with man.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; The father is spirit. Yes. What's the
[55:23] difference between father and holy
[55:25] spirit? The holy spirit has got to do
[55:28] with man.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; The Jewish Bible uses the word spirit.
[55:33] And you you may have heard this. The
[55:35] word ruak. Have you heard that? Which
[55:37] means breath or wind. Do you know the
[55:41] word ghost is in the Old Testament?
[55:44] And Abraham gave up the ghost
[55:47] &gt;&gt; and that's in the in the Hebrew. It's a
[55:49] completely different to which is spirit.
[55:52] Two separate words. One is ghost, one is
[55:55] spirit. Starts giving us more clues.
[55:58] Right? So in the Greek, which is now the
[56:01] New Testament, they didn't have this
[56:03] word ghost, which is English. It comes
[56:05] from the German word ghast. G A S T,
[56:10] which eventually came to be ghost. But
[56:13] then what is a ghost,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; right? Why would they use the word
[56:21] ghost?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Apparently ghost is the spirit of
[56:25] someone who has died.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Which is made visible.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; I saw the spirit. It was a ghost.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; So the spirit is invisible. But when
[56:40] it's visible, it's ghost. That's right.
[56:44] &gt;&gt; They had some reasoning behind what they
[56:46] were writing.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; They were not silly men. I tell you that
[56:51] &gt;&gt; right? So it's the same thing but not
[56:53] the same. There it is. We just have to
[56:56] understand what the meaning was. Right?
[56:59] So uh ghast in the old English means a
[57:02] spirit that can physically be seen. Like
[57:04] well you know people will say what's the
[57:06] matter with you? You look like you saw a
[57:08] ghost.
[57:09] &gt;&gt; You've heard that. You look like you've
[57:11] seen a ghost. Uh, and in the old English
[57:13] there would be the word apparition.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; You saw something. Something that should
[57:18] have been invisible became visible to
[57:20] you.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; So basically, it's so simple. It has
[57:25] much more to do with the change in
[57:27] dispensation because what it was showing
[57:29] was that the spirit of God, the spirit
[57:32] of Christ was becoming visible upon the
[57:35] people
[57:36] &gt;&gt; and they called that the Holy Ghost.
[57:38] Amen. Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Because they began to see his spirit
[57:41] becoming visible. How? Because they know
[57:44] what these men were doing was not their
[57:46] own spirit.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; It was the spirit of Christ coming upon
[57:50] them and they called it the ghost.
[57:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the change in dispensation
[57:56] brought forth change in manifestations
[57:59] of the same spirit.
[58:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So under the ages of the
[58:05] father from Adam right up to the
[58:07] conception of Christ for 4,000 years
[58:10] God's spirit upon men upon men anointing
[58:15] them being in them were only for
[58:18] prophets priests kings and judges
[58:22] not for all the public
[58:24] &gt;&gt; like you could see when Hannah was
[58:26] standing in the temple and she was she
[58:27] was whispering and and praying and Eli
[58:29] comes up to her and says what are you
[58:31] mad What are you doing? You know this is
[58:34] not allowed. Only we are supposed to
[58:36] speak to God, not you. You have no
[58:38] authority. And then she had to explain
[58:41] herself and he understood and and you
[58:43] can't be here in the temple doing this.
[58:45] You literally asked her, "Are you
[58:46] drunk?"
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Because only a drunk person would have
[58:49] the guts to do something like what
[58:51] you're doing right now. You must be out
[58:53] of your mind. Can you imagine that? You
[58:56] and I stand here and whisper and pray
[58:58] and there's no problem with that. But at
[59:00] that time, the Holy Spirit was seen as
[59:02] something specifically for prophets,
[59:04] priests, judges, and kings, men chosen
[59:08] by God.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Not for the public.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:12] &gt;&gt; And what happened with the Holy Spirit?
[59:14] Now, think of the same Holy Spirit
[59:15] that's on you on the Holy Spirit on
[59:19] those Old Testament saints. You know
[59:21] what they did with that spirit?
[59:24] It anointed them to do miraculous work.
[59:27] And they identified a fearsome god.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Right? If for example, Moses brings 10
[59:35] plagues that decimates an entire nation
[59:38] of of Egypt,
[59:40] &gt;&gt; kills the firstborn by the Holy Spirit.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Pillars of fire, Jericho's walls
[59:46] falling, son standing still, Mary's body
[59:50] receiving the blood cell. All those
[59:51] things leading up to that time, they
[59:53] were given abilities to kill their
[59:56] enemies. And even their brothers who
[59:59] went into error, same Holy Spirit.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Remember finance when one of the his
[1:00:06] brothers took uh a Midionite woman, he
[1:00:09] took a javelin and ran him through.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; How many of you feel like running a
[1:00:13] javelin through your brother who makes a
[1:00:14] mistake?
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; You have the same Holy Spirit. Not
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; what what is the difference?
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Something has changed in the
[1:00:23] dispensation. In the Old Testament, the
[1:00:26] greatness of the manifestations was seen
[1:00:28] in ways that is unmistakably not man's
[1:00:32] works. It was the Holy Spirit because we
[1:00:35] can identify that it was God's works.
[1:00:38] Only God could have done that.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; Inspire them to do that. Right. Great
[1:00:43] manifestations. They knew that man was
[1:00:46] not bringing the plagues. Yeah,
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; God was the one speaking through Moses.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; It was God's spirit in Moses. They knew
[1:00:53] that. And and so um they had abilities
[1:00:56] that today we just don't do. I mean, my
[1:01:01] my little boy asked me a month ago or
[1:01:04] something. He says, "So why don't
[1:01:07] why don't you do things why don't those
[1:01:09] great things happen today like opening
[1:01:11] the Red Sea and you know why don't you
[1:01:15] have all these great things you I mean
[1:01:16] it's like you can open the sea and walk
[1:01:18] all the way to brother Chad's church,
[1:01:20] you know, why don't you do that? Why do
[1:01:23] you have to uh fly? Why why do you not
[1:01:26] do things like they did in those days?"
[1:01:29] you know, can make a father feel really
[1:01:31] insignificant
[1:01:33] and be a preacher of God, right? In the
[1:01:37] New Testament, then Jesus comes and
[1:01:39] says, "I forgive you." They're beating
[1:01:43] him. They're cursing at him. They're
[1:01:44] spitting on him. And it says, "Father,
[1:01:46] forgive them. They know not what they
[1:01:47] do." Same Holy Spirit,
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. that would drive a javelin
[1:01:51] through a man, kill, decimate a nation,
[1:01:55] uh bring plagues upon people, bring
[1:01:58] suffering, suddenly it flips. Same Holy
[1:02:01] Spirit and it's just forgiveness and
[1:02:04] grace.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; What changed? Okay, this showing that it
[1:02:10] was not just an invisible spirit.
[1:02:13] Peter's shadow healed people. Yeah.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Laying on hands uh laying on of hands on
[1:02:20] healed people. Men's voices seem to
[1:02:23] raise the dead.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; To the people. This was a ghost, an
[1:02:29] invisible spirit made visible in normal
[1:02:33] men of even low degree or even
[1:02:36] insignificant status of life. Because
[1:02:38] after Jesus, the Holy Ghost fell upon
[1:02:42] all.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not just prophets, priests,
[1:02:45] judges, and kings.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Now it fell upon all flesh. Significant
[1:02:50] difference. The writers were saying this
[1:02:52] is the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between this one
[1:02:56] and the manifestation of the Old
[1:02:57] Testament.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Old Testament writers
[1:03:01] believe this anointing on men uh to be
[1:03:05] the actual breath of God or an invisible
[1:03:08] moving force. They call it the ru
[1:03:10] hakodesh in the Hebrew. And this is why
[1:03:13] the English translators chose to
[1:03:15] identify it as the Holy Spirit because
[1:03:19] the English translators interpreted
[1:03:21] spirit as breath. Right? For example, a
[1:03:24] dying person's breath leaving him was
[1:03:26] his spirit leaving him. And the other
[1:03:29] word used in the Hebrew uh in the same
[1:03:31] context is shakina.
[1:03:35] But in some places the translators still
[1:03:37] use Holy Spirit.
[1:03:41] I don't know about you, but I love to
[1:03:44] know everything about it.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; I don't want to leave a little piece
[1:03:47] out. I want to know everything about it
[1:03:50] so that I know what I've got when I get
[1:03:52] it.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it was the same Holy Spirit of
[1:03:56] God anointing man differently for
[1:03:59] different dispensations. Do we all get
[1:04:01] that?
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; The writers of this New Testament wrote
[1:04:04] in Aramaic. They wrote in Greek. And
[1:04:07] they use words described as air or
[1:04:09] breath in the in the Greek it's numa if
[1:04:12] those of you searching it up. So again
[1:04:14] this is where the translators use the
[1:04:16] word holy spirit but when they use the
[1:04:19] words anointing power etc they were
[1:04:23] referring to the holy ghost. Amen. So
[1:04:27] spirit
[1:04:29] power and anointing ghost spirit holy
[1:04:32] spirit that which is within you doing
[1:04:34] something but holy ghost power and
[1:04:37] anointing are we together right so the
[1:04:40] writers and translators knew the
[1:04:42] difference and they tried to express it
[1:04:44] differently giving it a name that would
[1:04:46] show the difference and the definition
[1:04:48] then the holy ghost or the holy spirit
[1:04:51] basically saints is the anointing of god
[1:04:54] for mankind now we got to understand why
[1:04:57] it's necessary.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; So, you still with me?
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; In every dispensation, it changes.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Every dispensation.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; We got to understand why it changes
[1:05:12] because the Holy Spirit is obedient to
[1:05:14] something.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the reason it changes.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Okay? Same Holy Spirit, but it's
[1:05:22] changing because it's obedient to
[1:05:23] something. What is it? Obedient to the
[1:05:27] revelation of the word for that day.
[1:05:31] &gt;&gt; It's going to anoint you. You know, like
[1:05:33] how the prophet says Moses couldn't take
[1:05:36] Noah's revelation and build an ark and
[1:05:39] sail out of Egypt.
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; Because that wasn't the word for that
[1:05:43] day.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; Moses would not have received the Holy
[1:05:46] Spirit ability to build an ark.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; That's right. And even though it would
[1:05:52] have been the word for a previous day
[1:05:54] and a great anointing and great ability
[1:05:57] would have been fantastic to see Moses
[1:05:59] and the people in Gan building an ark,
[1:06:01] it wasn't going to work.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; It was going to be an interpretation
[1:06:05] that was not going to work for their day
[1:06:07] because the Holy Spirit was not going to
[1:06:09] anoint them on the word of Noah's day.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost is
[1:06:15] influenced or rather follows the word
[1:06:18] for the day. That's why the
[1:06:20] manifestation is different.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; So when the full revelation of the word
[1:06:26] is come, the manifestations of the
[1:06:29] spirit need no longer be seen because
[1:06:32] the people would manifest the works by
[1:06:35] faith, not needing gifts or sensations
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; because the Holy Spirit is bringing you
[1:06:42] up to receive the full word. And when
[1:06:45] you have the full word, you are going to
[1:06:47] have the full manifestation of Christ
[1:06:49] made flesh. And you don't need help.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Which is what that Holy Spirit is. It's
[1:06:58] help. It's a guide.
[1:07:01] Amen. Now everything becomes one. It's
[1:07:04] the fullness of the Godhead bodily when
[1:07:06] it brings you up to that time when you
[1:07:07] become the word made flesh. Listen, I'm
[1:07:10] not saying you don't need the Holy Ghost
[1:07:12] anymore. Don't make that mistake.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Let's understand. So therefore, today
[1:07:18] people are expecting. This is the reason
[1:07:21] it's confusing because people are
[1:07:23] expecting to have the Holy Ghost like
[1:07:25] Acts chapter 2.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; And listen people, you know what a
[1:07:29] mockery it's been, right? From Pentecost
[1:07:33] all the way up to now. And it's what
[1:07:37] they call speaking in tongues was just
[1:07:39] glosselia.
[1:07:41] That's not what happened in Acts chapter
[1:07:42] 2. You know that they spoke different
[1:07:45] languages of other men
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; and and I don't know how the churches
[1:07:50] just let it slip and all you get is
[1:07:52] glosselia which is just like gibberish
[1:07:55] being spoken
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; and they just claim by by the Holy Ghost
[1:07:59] you know this is another language where
[1:08:02] there's actually supposed to be a person
[1:08:05] who speaks that language that interprets
[1:08:07] that.
[1:08:08] And then what we had is churches having
[1:08:10] someone speaking in in a tongue and then
[1:08:13] interpreting that
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; themselves and then it's not even
[1:08:17] interpreted by two or three witnesses to
[1:08:19] establish it. It's just accepted as a
[1:08:22] gift. And why? Because people are
[1:08:24] afraid.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; I was just telling brother Chad this and
[1:08:28] just just
[1:08:30] um a little bit off topic. when you take
[1:08:33] a gift of the Holy Ghost and and this is
[1:08:35] something serious that we did with
[1:08:37] people is um the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:41] have to be under subjection of humility
[1:08:45] because it's so easy to go to pride
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; right now and I asked my church this
[1:08:51] just last week I said to them uh how
[1:08:55] many of you here been in the message for
[1:08:57] like 30 40 years let's see your hands
[1:08:59] how many of you been here 30 40 years in
[1:09:01] the message Yes.
[1:09:03] So, how many of you you remember the uh
[1:09:06] people who spoke with tongues and
[1:09:08] prophesied? How many of you can remember
[1:09:11] yourself being comfortable with them?
[1:09:16] You were more terrified that they were
[1:09:18] going to expose you.
[1:09:22] That that's what I hope he doesn't
[1:09:24] prophesy about me. I hope he doesn't say
[1:09:26] something bad about me. And not that you
[1:09:28] have something bad, but you just w with
[1:09:30] these gifts somehow these gifts always
[1:09:32] speak bad things.
[1:09:35] There's just never any good things that
[1:09:36] they prophesy about. Just always
[1:09:38] something bad, you know. And so what
[1:09:41] happens is this fear sort of builds up
[1:09:44] in the people about this person with the
[1:09:46] gift. Now what happens when you do that?
[1:09:49] When you make yourself fearful of
[1:09:50] someone, you are giving that person
[1:09:52] power. Yes.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Power that corrupts him.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; See, and it shouldn't be that way
[1:10:00] because this man should be under
[1:10:02] humility.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; He should know he should he should know
[1:10:06] that this people should not fear him.
[1:10:08] And when you fear a man, you start to
[1:10:11] give him power that corrupts him. We
[1:10:13] corrupt them.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; And that's what's happened in the
[1:10:18] churches, right? So saints, when the
[1:10:22] full revelation of the word is come and
[1:10:24] we have the manifestation of the spirit,
[1:10:26] we need to see the proper manifestation
[1:10:28] of the spirit. That's for this day. Do
[1:10:30] you believe that?
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's get to it.
[1:10:34] Today, people are expecting to have the
[1:10:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost like Acts
[1:10:39] chapter 2, but it's a different
[1:10:41] dispensation. HOW DO WE KNOW? Because
[1:10:43] the word is different.
[1:10:45] And the Holy Spirit, the Holy Ghost must
[1:10:48] anoint people according to the word
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; for the day.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Agreed? All right. So, this is where we
[1:10:56] must find the middle of the road. Let's
[1:10:58] go to a quote here. I promise you, we're
[1:11:01] halfway.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Now, here the life that was in the husk,
[1:11:06] this is the message masterpiece. in the
[1:11:08] stalk and the tassel and the husk all
[1:11:10] gathers in the seed. And the life that
[1:11:12] was in the stalk went uh one went to
[1:11:15] make the other. Justification made a way
[1:11:17] for sanctification. Sanctification made
[1:11:19] a way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:21] And here it is. The baptism of the Holy
[1:11:24] Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:11:26] itself
[1:11:28] to come right down in perfection back to
[1:11:32] the word again to manifest itself. So
[1:11:35] see, I wasn't saying that when you have
[1:11:38] the fullness of the word, there's no
[1:11:39] need for the Holy Ghost.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; What what we are saying is there's no
[1:11:44] need for manifestations that were
[1:11:46] necessary when you didn't have the
[1:11:48] fullness of the word.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Think about it. Let me give you the
[1:11:54] picture. Right? So when they came out of
[1:11:56] the upper room and they've got no tapes,
[1:12:00] no CDs, no message, no Bibles,
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; they've got no written word to back up
[1:12:06] what they're saying.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; They're coming out to say Jesus Christ
[1:12:10] is God made flesh. He was crucified. He
[1:12:14] died and rose again. And we are
[1:12:16] witnesses of that. And what are the
[1:12:17] people going to say? Oh yeah.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Prove it.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Prove it. Yes.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; So with what little word they had, they
[1:12:26] required gifts of the Holy Ghost to
[1:12:29] vindicate what they were saying,
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; to vindicate their message. So the gifts
[1:12:35] of the Holy Ghost at that time and the
[1:12:37] the less word you have, the greater the
[1:12:40] manifestations need to be.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? And this is why as it
[1:12:45] progressed and the more the word came
[1:12:47] in, the less they needed help from the
[1:12:50] Holy Ghost to vindicate their word.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; And then we reached the end of the ages
[1:12:54] where you got this prophet
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; who's coming with the message to saying
[1:12:59] to say, I am the forerunner of the
[1:13:01] second coming of the Lord.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; And what are the people going to say? Oh
[1:13:05] yeah, prove it.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? So there needs to be
[1:13:10] a manifestation to vindicate the word
[1:13:12] that he's bringing.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; And that's why in the last day there
[1:13:16] needed to be an outpouring of the Holy
[1:13:18] Ghost again to vindicate something that
[1:13:20] was coming in.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; That's how it works.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when people are saying we need
[1:13:28] to see this, I know there's some some
[1:13:29] places in Africa where they're insisting
[1:13:32] like today uh when I mean now in 2025,
[1:13:36] you'll have ministers saying every
[1:13:38] single pastor must have the supernatural
[1:13:40] following him. He must have some kind of
[1:13:44] uh supernatural manifestation or else
[1:13:46] he's not a true minister.
[1:13:49] like he he must either prophesy or speak
[1:13:51] with tongues and then it puts pressure
[1:13:53] on the men and then the men start faking
[1:13:55] things
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; and and to what to what end?
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; you have the fullness of the word. The
[1:14:01] fullness of the word is come. So so then
[1:14:03] if you are still depending on the
[1:14:05] ability to vindicate you, why do we need
[1:14:08] to vindicate a word that has already
[1:14:09] been vindicated?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; It has been fully vindicated. We are
[1:14:14] preaching word that has already been
[1:14:17] fully vindicated.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; So then what do I need to vindicate
[1:14:22] myself? If I want to vindicate myself,
[1:14:24] then I have serious inferiority complex.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Then I need to prove myself to the
[1:14:30] people to elevate myself.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; That's not what the holy the Holy Ghost
[1:14:35] is not going to clown for anyone.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You believe that?
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Back to the word again to manifest
[1:14:42] itself. But when denominated well or
[1:14:44] what denominated dies like life in
[1:14:47] Lutheran we're reading again went to
[1:14:49] make Wesley and from Wesley went to
[1:14:51] Pentecost and from Pentecost to make the
[1:14:52] original seed onto Pentecost comes out
[1:14:55] of the Wesley until that time. The
[1:14:57] reason that Pentecost come out of Wesley
[1:14:59] because it was no denomination. Uh
[1:15:02] Pentecost was the this is what I want to
[1:15:05] get to. Then Pentecost went to
[1:15:07] denominate and what did it do? It turned
[1:15:11] to the husk. It looked like the real
[1:15:14] thing.
[1:15:17] &gt;&gt; Pentecost looked like the real thing.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I I keep telling um message
[1:15:23] people,
[1:15:25] please when you are reading things like
[1:15:28] this, understand that the prophet is
[1:15:30] talking about himself.
[1:15:36] What's he telling you? He's the real
[1:15:38] thing.
[1:15:43] Go read the message. He'll tell you,
[1:15:44] "We've had all the Elijah's mantels and
[1:15:47] the rushing winds and we've had the
[1:15:48] blood in the hands and we've had all of
[1:15:50] this. We've had impersonations."
[1:15:52] Impersonations of what?
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; He's being humble.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; He's telling you they are impersonations
[1:15:59] of his gift,
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; of his ministry. The more he came out
[1:16:03] and he came out with the first pull,
[1:16:04] everybody wanted the same or even
[1:16:06] better. And then they all had to come
[1:16:08] out with something extra special to to
[1:16:10] overdo what or rather to to to um uh
[1:16:14] have preeminence over what he had. And
[1:16:16] then when he when he was in his second
[1:16:18] pool, then they all wanted to have
[1:16:20] something else.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; And then he would start concocting
[1:16:24] things and having interviews with people
[1:16:26] and getting to know the secret lives.
[1:16:28] And be careful of today. There are
[1:16:29] people doing that.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Do you know how easy it is in
[1:16:33] Pentecostal churches? It's so sorrowful,
[1:16:37] pitiful that these people are so duped
[1:16:40] by all these men with gifts.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; It's so easy to have your secret fella
[1:16:45] there in the back going on Facebook and
[1:16:47] looking at somebody's profile and he's
[1:16:48] got a mic in he's got a thing in here
[1:16:51] saying this person was uh you know uh in
[1:16:54] Africa last week and they were wearing
[1:16:56] this color clothes. The man stands, I
[1:16:58] see you in Africa
[1:17:01] and you were wearing these clothes and
[1:17:03] you had a pearl necklace on.
[1:17:06] But his inspiration is coming from
[1:17:08] Facebook and the guy in his ear.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; I'm from Africa. I've seen these people
[1:17:13] do this.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Do tricks with the iPads and whatever.
[1:17:18] And and they're claiming this to be
[1:17:20] gifts of the Holy Ghost. It's so easy to
[1:17:22] act like you have discernment to try and
[1:17:24] be like the prophet. In the meantime,
[1:17:26] you're using social media
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; and the people just don't even know
[1:17:30] that. I I don't understand.
[1:17:34] Then he shows how that Pentecost or
[1:17:36] brother Brandham's day, his day, had the
[1:17:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost, but yet there
[1:17:42] was still the Holy Ghost person
[1:17:45] still to come, which is our day.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Did you see that in the quote?
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Right. Justification made way for
[1:17:53] sanctification. sanctification made way
[1:17:54] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And
[1:17:56] here it is, the baptism of the Holy
[1:17:59] Ghost made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:18:01] itself to come right down in perfection.
[1:18:04] He's literally giving us the process.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And now in a day where you and I are to
[1:18:10] be receiving the person,
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; the the people, the ministers want you
[1:18:15] to go back and get the baptism
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; of the previous day.
[1:18:22] That's right.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with the baptism.
[1:18:26] You and I individually still have to go.
[1:18:28] We have to go through our own process of
[1:18:29] justification, sanctification. He was
[1:18:31] talking about similar to the seed,
[1:18:33] right? What was the seed? Goes from the
[1:18:35] seed. It goes to the stalk, the leaves,
[1:18:37] the tassel, the husk. He said the husk
[1:18:40] looks like the real thing.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; People will take the baptism of the Holy
[1:18:45] Ghost, excuse me, and it looks like the
[1:18:47] real thing,
[1:18:49] but the real thing is something else.
[1:18:51] Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's go through a
[1:18:54] summary. Let's go to E um Ezekiel. Oh, I
[1:18:58] didn't read that second half for you.
[1:19:01] I'll put on the screen. Ezekiel 36:26
[1:19:03] 27. You love him, saints.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; You know this very very well. A new
[1:19:07] heart also will I give you. A new spirit
[1:19:10] will I put within you, and I will take
[1:19:12] away the stony heart out of your flesh,
[1:19:14] and I will give you an heart of flesh,
[1:19:16] and I will put my spirit within you.
[1:19:20] Amen.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; So up to that point, I mean, you have a
[1:19:23] new heart, you get a new spirit, you get
[1:19:25] a new nature. Basically, I will take
[1:19:27] away your stony heart and all of that,
[1:19:29] but we know the final desire of God is
[1:19:33] that his spirit
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; dwells in you.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Not gifts, not anointings.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; I will put my spirit within you. Amen.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Now people look at that today and say
[1:19:48] his spirit within me must produce all
[1:19:50] the the the signs and wonders and
[1:19:53] miracles and so on. His spirit is not
[1:19:56] going to do what you wanted to do.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; It's going to follow the word for the
[1:20:02] day.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; That's what's important,
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; right? Look at Joel chapter 2.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Okay. And it shall come to pass
[1:20:11] afterward that I will pour out my spirit
[1:20:12] upon all flesh and your sons and
[1:20:14] daughters. Now this is listen what he
[1:20:17] wanted to do was put his spirit within
[1:20:18] you. But Joel prophesied of the spirit
[1:20:21] upon you
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; upon all flesh and your sons and
[1:20:24] daughters. And he's identifying you're
[1:20:26] going to prophesy. You're going to dream
[1:20:27] dreams. Your young men shall see visions
[1:20:29] and also upon the servants and upon the
[1:20:31] handmmaids. So when it came in Acts
[1:20:33] chapter 2, Peter says this is that which
[1:20:35] was spoken by the prophet Joel. So he is
[1:20:38] identifying that what came in Acts
[1:20:40] chapter 2 was what Joel prophesied of
[1:20:43] the spirit upon all flesh. The anointing
[1:20:46] on the flesh, not the spirit of God
[1:20:49] within you.
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Hold that thought. Notice the
[1:20:55] difference.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; Acts two was the fulfillment of Joel,
[1:20:59] not Ezekiel.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Ezekiel is not pouring out
[1:21:05] my spirit upon all flesh.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Ezekiel is putting my spirit within the
[1:21:10] elect.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Not the rain falling on the just and the
[1:21:14] unjust.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; God does not put his spirit in people
[1:21:18] who will then lose it.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Do you see why the same and not the
[1:21:24] same?
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Let's move on.
[1:21:27] So his spirit upon everyone is all right
[1:21:31] because it helps push an agenda. It
[1:21:33] helps push God's agenda for that age and
[1:21:36] gets the church moving forward. But when
[1:21:38] it comes to the capstone time, it has to
[1:21:41] do with the spirit of God in his people.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; That's what we should be desiring. Amen.
[1:21:48] So uh father, word, son, holy spirit,
[1:21:53] holy ghost and then it must lead to the
[1:21:56] fullness of everything in the bride.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; Right? And if we can define the
[1:22:01] differences between father and son, word
[1:22:04] and son, why are we afraid or too
[1:22:06] religious to differentiate between holy
[1:22:08] spirit and holy ghost?
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Let's have a look. What is the holy
[1:22:12] spirit? Right? It is the anointing of
[1:22:16] god given for man. We can start there.
[1:22:18] The Holy Spirit originally worked with
[1:22:21] the spirit of man only originally from
[1:22:24] the Old Testament. After Christ came,
[1:22:27] the Holy Spirit changed to a new
[1:22:29] dispensation. It became the Holy Ghost
[1:22:32] dispensation
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; over church ages. Is that right? And the
[1:22:36] Holy Spirit which once anointed entire
[1:22:39] beings of prophets, high priests.
[1:22:42] Listen. Elijah
[1:22:45] ran before the chariot of Ahab.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has no desire to make you
[1:22:51] do that today.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; There's no reason for that.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Not even to prove something to you,
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; right? Uh so the Holy Spirit anointed
[1:23:01] their entire being. I mean it gave if
[1:23:04] you try to run faster than a horse, your
[1:23:06] heart will pack up in 10 minutes. Not
[1:23:09] even 10 minutes. In fact, in 2025, we
[1:23:12] wouldn't make it 100 m.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; That's how
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; unhealthy we are.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; So, I'm just saying that that's not even
[1:23:21] a normal thing that the human body can
[1:23:23] do that would have to take the Holy
[1:23:26] Spirit to anoint to give ability to the
[1:23:28] body to do that.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Right. It's a it's an an abnormal
[1:23:35] ability
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; that we know can only come from God. So
[1:23:39] the Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit
[1:23:43] anointing the flesh of all men and women
[1:23:46] who believe. Agreed? So the Holy Ghost
[1:23:50] was differentiated by the scribes of uh
[1:23:54] the Bible as the Holy Spirit. The same
[1:23:56] Holy Spirit that was in David, the same
[1:23:58] Holy Spirit that anointed Moses. The
[1:24:00] Holy Ghost is the same Holy Spirit
[1:24:03] except now it's following the word of
[1:24:06] Christ.
[1:24:09] go into the world, baptize them in the
[1:24:12] name of the Father, Son, Holy Ghost,
[1:24:14] cast out devils, heal the sick. That's
[1:24:16] the word of Christ. Now, that same Holy
[1:24:18] Spirit that was anointing men to kill
[1:24:21] the enemies, now it's anointing men to
[1:24:23] follow the word of Christ,
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; right? It's not going to go back. Even
[1:24:29] if those people, Peter and Paul and all
[1:24:31] these men being put into prison and uh
[1:24:34] the the the saints being eaten by lions
[1:24:36] and bears in the circus, you know, they
[1:24:39] could have been praying, Lord, give me
[1:24:40] the power to stand up and destroy all
[1:24:42] these gladiators. Go and wh you know,
[1:24:45] whack off the head of the emperor of
[1:24:47] Rome and give us the victory. The Holy
[1:24:49] Spirit was not going to do that.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; It's following the word for the day.
[1:24:53] Amen.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Barham uses, here's an uh more
[1:24:58] to it. Brother Barham uses both phrases,
[1:25:01] Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit,
[1:25:03] interchangeably as if they are the same.
[1:25:06] That's why I want to tell you young
[1:25:07] people, all we're doing today is just
[1:25:10] simplifying it for you so that you don't
[1:25:13] doubt what you have
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; and you don't judge yourself by other
[1:25:17] people or by some revelation or
[1:25:20] something of some other man. You need to
[1:25:22] know and and so when they say the Holy
[1:25:25] Spirit here, when brother says the Holy
[1:25:27] Spirit here, know that he's talking
[1:25:29] about the Holy Ghost,
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; the gifts when he's talking about the
[1:25:32] Holy Ghost here, know that he's talking
[1:25:34] about the baptism.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; But know other places when he's talking
[1:25:37] about here is talking about the person.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Know the difference.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; All right. So, brother Bham taught the
[1:25:47] difference between having the baptism of
[1:25:49] the Holy Ghost and having the person of
[1:25:52] the Holy Ghost.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; Right? Brother Brandham also taught that
[1:25:55] the Holy Spirit was once given with
[1:25:58] measure.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; But the hol the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:01] Ghost is the fullness of the Holy Spirit
[1:26:03] spread over the church.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; How fullness? Some would have a gift of
[1:26:07] this, others would have a gift of that.
[1:26:09] Not every person has the fullness of the
[1:26:11] gift in one person. That's right. But
[1:26:14] the fullness is spread out over the
[1:26:15] entire body of the bride.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost upon a
[1:26:21] single person is the anointing of the
[1:26:24] Holy Spirit to give a particular ability
[1:26:27] to that believer that is necessary not
[1:26:31] even for you.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; It's for God's purpose for the church
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; for other people. The baptism of the
[1:26:40] Holy Ghost given for Peter was so that
[1:26:43] the word could be believed by others.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; So there's a purpose behind it. Amen.
[1:26:53] The purpose for vindicating the word to
[1:26:54] others. The Holy Spirit was described as
[1:26:58] that which followed the leading of the
[1:27:00] father ministry. In other words, the Old
[1:27:02] Testament. The Holy Ghost was described
[1:27:05] as that which is following the son's
[1:27:07] ministry.
[1:27:09] Got it?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; I hope I'm not going too fast. So, this
[1:27:13] is how it all happened. The Holy Spirit
[1:27:16] is an attribute of God. It's just
[1:27:20] English words, right? It's an attribute
[1:27:22] of God which came into manifestation
[1:27:24] when the first man was created to give
[1:27:28] that man power on earth to be God on
[1:27:32] earth. Why? Because he was flesh. If
[1:27:36] he's given the spirit of God, now he
[1:27:39] becomes the vessel of God to fulfill the
[1:27:43] purpose of God.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Right? So that's why I said Holy Spirit
[1:27:47] has got to do with man.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; You know when you got that then you
[1:27:52] understand the true mystery of the
[1:27:54] godhead is it becomes in the end time it
[1:27:59] the trinity to the the Catholics is
[1:28:00] father son holy spirit. But when you
[1:28:02] understand what holy spirit is then you
[1:28:04] find yourself in the godhead. Amen.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; Then you know it's father, son, and
[1:28:08] bride
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; complete because the Holy Spirit was
[1:28:11] given to bring anointing to mankind.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; And you and I must find ourselves in the
[1:28:17] Godhead.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; That is the mystery of it.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Tell that to a Catholic, they'll kill
[1:28:23] you.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; When man sinned, he lost constant
[1:28:28] contact with the Holy Spirit along with
[1:28:31] his theophony. Right? As time passed,
[1:28:33] God anointed certain prophets, kings,
[1:28:36] and priests with measure by inspiring
[1:28:39] them by the Holy Spirit to fulfill a
[1:28:41] purpose.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying is Gideon received
[1:28:47] the Holy Spirit to go and do what he had
[1:28:49] to do. And then Gideon went home and
[1:28:53] that which he was inspired with was
[1:28:55] over. Now he was Gideon again.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; And Gideon was making mistakes that he
[1:28:59] should not have. Yeah.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; Which means the Holy Ghost came for a
[1:29:06] purpose regarding the word and that's
[1:29:08] it.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; At that time.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; And then he went back to being Gideon
[1:29:12] again and you know got old and uh made
[1:29:16] mistakes with him and his family and
[1:29:18] took the ephford and people started
[1:29:21] making an idol of it. Is that right?
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Same man who had this great
[1:29:26] manifestation. One of the greatest
[1:29:28] battles we read of in the Bible, he had
[1:29:30] the Holy Spirit. How could a man, we
[1:29:32] would say, how could a man with the Holy
[1:29:34] Spirit go and take the ephod and make an
[1:29:36] idol out of it?
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; How could Samson having the Holy Spirit
[1:29:42] go and commit adultery knowing that he's
[1:29:45] a Nazerite?
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; And then God still use him, give him the
[1:29:50] Holy Spirit at the right time to bring
[1:29:51] down a temple and then he dies.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:56] As time passed, God, in other words,
[1:29:58] they received the Holy Spirit for a
[1:30:00] season. They fulfilled their purpose and
[1:30:03] then it passed.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; When Christ came, he changed the
[1:30:09] revelation of God to man. A new
[1:30:13] revelation of God was coming forth. The
[1:30:16] Holy Spirit now could anoint the flesh
[1:30:18] of them that believed on Christ because
[1:30:21] Christ was the the re the mystery of God
[1:30:23] revealed to them.
[1:30:24] &gt;&gt; Right now, the outpouring of the Holy
[1:30:27] Spirit on a group of people in Acts
[1:30:28] chapter 2 was called for the first time
[1:30:31] the baptism
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Ghost. We're going to
[1:30:35] understand what that means in a little
[1:30:37] while. See, I didn't say just now,
[1:30:39] brother.
[1:30:41] The outpouring of the baptism of the
[1:30:43] Holy Ghost upon a group of people was
[1:30:46] given in the Pentecostal age right there
[1:30:48] in the beginning. Right? And now we
[1:30:50] receive again a baptism of the Holy
[1:30:52] Ghost former latter reign in the end
[1:30:54] time.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Right? So the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:58] then has to make way for the person of
[1:31:01] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; to come into the believer. Not just an
[1:31:05] anointing to push an agenda, but now to
[1:31:08] come into the believer by the believer
[1:31:11] accepting and believing completely the
[1:31:14] full revealed word for the day.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; They could not do that in all the other
[1:31:19] ages. So the Holy Spirit, the Holy
[1:31:21] Ghost, whatever you want to call him,
[1:31:23] anointing and so on was leading so that
[1:31:26] the eventual person could come into us.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The believer is sealed
[1:31:33] by that Holy Spirit, not the baptism.
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; We're going to find that out, too.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; So, this would follow the father to take
[1:31:43] his place and start living and dwelling
[1:31:46] in the soul of man. This is my beloved
[1:31:48] son in whom I am well pleased to dwell
[1:31:51] in. God comes and says Revelations 21,
[1:31:54] these are my people. I shall be their
[1:31:56] God. I am dwelling with them. I am in
[1:31:58] them. I am dwelling uh in them. I am
[1:32:01] with them. They are my tabernacle.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost can be
[1:32:07] received by those who believe with their
[1:32:09] mind with their minds and not with their
[1:32:12] heart. The baptism
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; because it falls in the just and the
[1:32:18] unjust.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; These make believers can receive the
[1:32:22] Holy Ghost, the baptism of the Holy
[1:32:24] Ghost and still go to hell.
[1:32:27] BUT YOU CANNOT RECEIVE THE PERSONAL
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; and go to hell.
[1:32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Let's look at what and you can go
[1:32:37] through the message. We're drawing it to
[1:32:39] a close. You can go through the entire
[1:32:41] message and you can see how the prophet
[1:32:43] targets sensations, right? And speaks
[1:32:46] about sensations. And I love that he's
[1:32:48] done this, right? I'm just showing you
[1:32:51] some statements. I'm not going to put up
[1:32:52] the whole quote, just statements. Look
[1:32:54] at this one. Don't try to have any
[1:32:56] sensation or anything take the place of
[1:32:59] the Holy Spirit.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; When the new birth is come, you are
[1:33:03] changed.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Don't let sensations take the place of
[1:33:07] the Holy Spirit.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Look at the next one. Every person
[1:33:12] that's been born again of the Holy
[1:33:13] Spirit
[1:33:15] uh truly born, not just thought they
[1:33:18] were born, not went through some
[1:33:20] emotion, not went through some
[1:33:21] sensation, but was truly born. They
[1:33:24] could have all the emotion sensation
[1:33:26] with it, but you have you could have the
[1:33:28] sensation and emotion and not be born.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; How about this one? God don't want you
[1:33:36] to run after gifts. He wants you to
[1:33:38] thirst after him.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; I I would rather see young people. I
[1:33:45] would rather see that.
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Because I know that there's a promise
[1:33:49] that comes with thirsting after him. Him
[1:33:52] that thirsts after righteousness,
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; hungers and thirst after righteousness,
[1:33:57] you shall be filled.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Go looking for that. Don't run after
[1:34:01] gifts. Don't run after signs. Amen.
[1:34:04] Thirst for him. That's what he wants.
[1:34:06] How about this? We cannot base our
[1:34:09] salvation upon sensations or experiences
[1:34:13] of others or on our own experiences.
[1:34:17] Experience. It's you cannot even base
[1:34:19] your salvation on your own experience.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the word of God because
[1:34:25] that's the true mark.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE TRUE MARK. You know what he
[1:34:32] speaks about in the in what is the Holy
[1:34:33] Ghost? The Holy Ghost is a mark. It's a
[1:34:36] seal.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; It's an identification of something.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the the word of God is the
[1:34:44] true mark.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Okay. So I want to get
[1:34:47] to this thought lost and not lost.
[1:34:51] Okay,
[1:34:53] let's start with having the Holy Ghost
[1:34:55] and going to hell. In leadership, he
[1:34:58] says the choice of your conduct. You
[1:35:01] could you can mix it now. You're either
[1:35:02] of God or against God. And the outward
[1:35:05] expression shows exactly what's on the
[1:35:07] inside. The cocka many of you think I
[1:35:09] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:35:11] going to heaven. That don't mean one
[1:35:14] thing that you're going to heaven. No,
[1:35:16] sir. You can have the baptism of the
[1:35:19] Holy Ghost every hour in your life and
[1:35:21] still be lost and go to hell. The Bible
[1:35:24] says so. Uh-huh. That's exactly right.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; I know you've heard this before.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; But this is why it's important to
[1:35:32] separate what it is.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; You can have the anointing
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; every hour in your life and go to hell,
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; not the person. That's right.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; And God does not give the person
[1:35:46] willy-nilly to people.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; So why was the anointing given? The
[1:35:52] anointing of the same spirit. What is
[1:35:55] anointing? Ability.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Why is ability given? To vindicate the
[1:36:00] word
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; to push a purpose or an agenda. Right?
[1:36:06] How about this one? There's a question
[1:36:09] someone asked, "Brother Baram, if
[1:36:11] possible for a person to be lost and end
[1:36:12] up in hell if he rejects the light of
[1:36:14] the word even though he has a genuine
[1:36:16] experience of justification and
[1:36:18] sanctification."
[1:36:20] There's two things in that question.
[1:36:21] Brother Ram said, "Yes, sir. That's
[1:36:22] exactly right.
[1:36:24] You can have a genuine experience of
[1:36:27] justification and sanctification and
[1:36:29] reject the word."
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; Why was that possible? Because there was
[1:36:35] a time,
[1:36:37] you know, justification is a is a is an
[1:36:41] experience. Sanctification is an
[1:36:43] experience. And this is what people
[1:36:45] struggle with understanding how you can
[1:36:47] have all these experiences. And we go
[1:36:50] back in our past and say, well, I know
[1:36:52] for sure who I am because this on this
[1:36:54] date and so on. We're so good at that.
[1:36:56] On that date and this time, this brother
[1:36:58] did this and whatever. I remember that
[1:36:59] was the day of my salvation. I'm
[1:37:01] homeward bound. Glory to God.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; How many people have we heard saying
[1:37:07] that and then they come and deny the
[1:37:09] open book.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; And deny the seven seal is open
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; and deny the thunders and place it in
[1:37:16] the future.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; How is how is the Holy Spirit? You can
[1:37:22] have the Holy Ghost and do that.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; But having the Holy Spirit, you will not
[1:37:29] do that.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Do you understand? Young
[1:37:32] people,
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; big difference.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Then look at this one. And I know we
[1:37:37] read the scripture earlier, but let's
[1:37:39] look at what the prophet says. Are you
[1:37:41] still with me?
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Young people, I hope you're catching
[1:37:45] Ephesians 4:30, which says, "You are
[1:37:47] sealed by the Holy Spirit till the day
[1:37:49] of your redemption." I want you to
[1:37:51] notice what the prophet says. The Holy
[1:37:53] Ghost is God's Easter seal that seals us
[1:37:56] for eternity. Amen. seals us for
[1:38:00] eternity. Now, this is what I'm pointing
[1:38:01] to you to. He's not saying the baptism
[1:38:04] of the Holy Ghost is the Easter Seal.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; This is why I say he uses it
[1:38:08] interchangeably.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; And I love it because that's why it is
[1:38:12] in mystery form.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; How can you in in one place he says you
[1:38:17] can have the Holy Ghost every hour of
[1:38:19] your life and go to hell,
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; but there he says the Holy Ghost is
[1:38:23] God's Easter Seal and seals us for
[1:38:25] eternity.
[1:38:27] And moving on, it says God's Holy
[1:38:29] Spirit.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, are you glad? Are you glad for
[1:38:34] Easter? Are you glad for this
[1:38:35] experience? Sealed. Shut in with God in
[1:38:38] your secret place. Shut in with God by
[1:38:40] his divine grace. Sealed till the day of
[1:38:43] our redemption. That's the true. That's
[1:38:45] a real true Easter seal. So which is
[1:38:48] true? One is the anointing and one is
[1:38:51] the divine nature of the person. Amen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. However you want to
[1:38:58] say it, they are just words. Words that
[1:39:01] people use, words that the prophet used
[1:39:03] interchangeably, but you need to know,
[1:39:05] young people clearly what it is
[1:39:08] referring to. And old people are
[1:39:10] starting to doubt your experience.
[1:39:13] You need to know what it means when you
[1:39:16] are reading all those quotes and
[1:39:17] statements because there's going to be
[1:39:19] ministries and people who are going to
[1:39:20] come up and use the same thing and tell
[1:39:22] you that you're supposed to be doing
[1:39:24] this. You're supposed to be having this.
[1:39:26] You're supposed to be feeling this. And
[1:39:27] the worst thing is they're going to
[1:39:29] judge your life and say to you, "If you
[1:39:31] have the Holy Spirit, you won't do this.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; If you have the Holy Ghost, you won't do
[1:39:36] this. If you have this, you won't this
[1:39:37] won't happen." AND WE START JUDGING ONE
[1:39:39] another and judging ourselves by that.
[1:39:43] God is not interested in your feelings
[1:39:46] or your emotions. God is concerned with
[1:39:49] only one thing, his purpose.
[1:39:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to uh finding the middle
[1:39:57] of the road with this. This is the
[1:39:59] message. Hebrews chapter 1.
[1:40:02] You still with me? Amen.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Now, on this side, when people get
[1:40:06] converted, their minds is set on Christ
[1:40:09] and they're just a little scholarly.
[1:40:12] Amen. And don't keep under prayer, they
[1:40:15] get real cold and stiff and starchy and
[1:40:18] indifferent. And then if they're just a
[1:40:20] little bit nervous, if you I like how he
[1:40:22] says that a little bit nervous. He's
[1:40:24] being so nice. I'm not as nice. If you
[1:40:28] don't watch, they just get radical and
[1:40:30] wild on the side. See? and they go into
[1:40:32] sensations and everything.
[1:40:36] Paragraph 71. But the real church is a
[1:40:40] real sane gospel.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; Right in the middle of the road. It's
[1:40:46] not cold and starchy. Neither is it
[1:40:48] fanaticism.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; It's a real good old warm gospel,
[1:40:53] heartfelt love of God going right down
[1:40:56] the middle of the road, calling from
[1:40:58] both sides. That's right. That's what
[1:41:02] how you going to get that church right
[1:41:04] out of the word the urum and thumb.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; What are we saying? All right. So, this
[1:41:10] is where we bring it together. How does
[1:41:12] one stay in the middle of the road with
[1:41:14] sensations? I know how complex we are,
[1:41:16] saints. I know what I've been in the
[1:41:19] message since I'm 5 years old, right? Or
[1:41:22] the message was on upon me until I got
[1:41:25] into it, however you want to say it,
[1:41:28] right? But I've seen it. I' I've I've
[1:41:30] watched it develop. I've watched the
[1:41:32] people around it. I've I've been
[1:41:34] criticized by people from the time I'm
[1:41:36] I'm a teenager and telling me about this
[1:41:39] or about my dressing or my hairstyle or
[1:41:42] whatever. You know, if you if you had a
[1:41:46] sneaker with white laces, it was
[1:41:48] worldly. If you put colored laces, it
[1:41:50] was worldly. If it was a certain type of
[1:41:52] brand, it was worldly. I mean, you could
[1:41:54] you might as well go barefoot.
[1:41:58] If you use cream in your hair, it's
[1:42:00] worldly. If you left it dry and floppy,
[1:42:02] it's worldly. Everything is just
[1:42:04] worldly. There's like nowhere to walk
[1:42:06] because every single person has a
[1:42:08] different idea about something.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; You know, I told our our church last
[1:42:13] week, some of you have gotten so holy in
[1:42:16] your dressing, you wouldn't have Sister
[1:42:17] Ma in your church.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; You'll kick her out because you gotten
[1:42:23] so holy. Some of you got so holy you'll
[1:42:26] kick brother Brandham out.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; I mean, you should see what's going on
[1:42:31] in Africa.
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; We've become this people that's like
[1:42:35] we've got these standards that's that's
[1:42:38] way out there that nobody can attain.
[1:42:40] It's like what Christ was telling the
[1:42:42] Pharisees, you put a burden upon the
[1:42:44] people that you yourself won't even uh
[1:42:47] uh push or even lift. Yes.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; And we're judging people based on those
[1:42:54] things. On the on what? On what our idea
[1:42:58] of the Holy Spirit is.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; How do we find the middle of the road?
[1:43:02] So, here's what happens. Like I'm
[1:43:04] telling you, I've been through this. You
[1:43:05] got some people who who uh will say,
[1:43:09] "Well, we've got the word, you know, and
[1:43:12] our our song service is perfect." and
[1:43:15] another church comes and tells us, "You
[1:43:17] guys are dead. There's no spirit in
[1:43:20] you." Well, that's based on what their
[1:43:22] interpretation of spirit is. And then we
[1:43:24] will go to their church and say, "Man,
[1:43:26] these guys don't have the spirit.
[1:43:28] They're so rowdy. There's just no order.
[1:43:30] They have this and that." You know, I
[1:43:32] see because even my little fellow, my my
[1:43:35] son is so judgmental
[1:43:38] about us and about other people and
[1:43:40] everything because he's used to
[1:43:41] something his way. I can see it actually
[1:43:42] in the children.
[1:43:45] So you get under this pressure and I
[1:43:48] like what brother Maram says. It's not
[1:43:51] cold and starchy. Neither is it
[1:43:53] fanaticism.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; We've got to pull it together
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; and get the middle of the road.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; There needs to be expression.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; You cannot be an old dead stick
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; in the presence of God. If God has done
[1:44:07] something in your heart, there has to be
[1:44:09] an expression.
[1:44:10] There has to be an uh even something
[1:44:13] individual.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; It's quite simple. Be honest with
[1:44:19] yourself first.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Are you feeling what you claim to be
[1:44:23] feeling? If you are having a genuine
[1:44:27] sensation as God's word is proceed
[1:44:29] proceeding, it will manifest itself as
[1:44:32] the spirit within you and will lead you.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; The most important thing, it will be in
[1:44:38] line with the word.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; That's what we got to watch for,
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; saints. If what you're doing is causing
[1:44:46] a stumbling block or confusion,
[1:44:49] then you have to adjust yourself.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; And the word will adjust you
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; with grace.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, this is crucial. It should not
[1:44:58] make the church uncomfortable or
[1:45:01] nervous. Your gift should not do that to
[1:45:03] someone. Your expression should not do
[1:45:06] that to someone. It and and you don't
[1:45:08] stand there and you're losing your mind
[1:45:11] in the spirit and then you're nudging
[1:45:12] someone. Come on, be one of us.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; If he just wants to stand there and be
[1:45:17] quiet and just tear come down on his
[1:45:19] eye, that's his expression.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; That the beautiful part of the Holy
[1:45:23] Spirit in each person is it's unique.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; And and God knows our lives. God knows
[1:45:29] our heart. He knows exactly how the word
[1:45:32] in us. He knows what word actually is
[1:45:35] residing in our soul and our expression
[1:45:37] is going to be based upon that and
[1:45:39] there's going to be a purpose that God
[1:45:41] has to fulfill through us.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Based on what word you have inside. So
[1:45:45] this is crucial. It should not make the
[1:45:48] church uncomfortable or nervous. Listen,
[1:45:51] the same Holy Ghost that made David
[1:45:55] strip off his clothes and dance before
[1:45:57] the ark is the same Holy Ghost that's
[1:45:59] anointing you to make sure you keep your
[1:46:01] clothes on. in the presence of the Lord.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; But it was necessary that day and the
[1:46:07] person his own wife criticizing him for
[1:46:09] doing that. God judged her for it
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; because it was the anointing of God in
[1:46:15] his life doing that.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; But it won't do that with us today
[1:46:19] because there is a word today
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; that is carrying a different agenda,
[1:46:24] different purpose.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; All right. So, as we close this down,
[1:46:29] there's something we need to look at.
[1:46:32] Baptism and holy. Okay. So, baptism of
[1:46:37] the Holy Ghost. What is baptism? What is
[1:46:40] the meaning of baptism? Okay. It's a
[1:46:43] Jewish concept. It's a Jewish tradition.
[1:46:46] And they use baptism like pouring water
[1:46:48] over Aaron the high priest. It was an
[1:46:52] outward expression of something that was
[1:46:54] being done, inducting him into a body.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; That's what it was for. But what was it
[1:47:01] signifying? Washing.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Washing away. Washing away what?
[1:47:09] Purging. Purging what? So we know what
[1:47:13] baptism now is. And now what is holy?
[1:47:17] Right? Holy means set apart for purpose.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Holy has got nothing to do with cood.
[1:47:28] Because if you say, "Be holy as your
[1:47:30] father in heaven is holy."
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; What's that about?
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; The father in heaven doesn't wear
[1:47:38] shorts.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have to worry about TV or
[1:47:41] music or
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; So what what is the holiness of the
[1:47:45] father?
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; How are you to be holy as your father in
[1:47:49] heaven is holy? He is holy because he's
[1:47:52] committed to his purpose.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; He is set apart for his purpose.
[1:47:58] So if you are holy, it's calling you to
[1:48:00] be set apart for a purpose.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen people, living right,
[1:48:07] dressing right is reasonable service.
[1:48:09] It's actually common sense.
[1:48:12] you know, um um if you see me standing
[1:48:16] here in a pair of shorts and a torn
[1:48:19] t-shirt and and tattoos all over me and
[1:48:22] an earring and and here am I preaching
[1:48:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, what is
[1:48:26] the efficacy of my message?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Where is the the efficiency? Where is
[1:48:32] the the power of my message? My
[1:48:35] presentation of myself is diminishing my
[1:48:38] message.
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; Right? So I'm saying that those things
[1:48:42] are just reasonable service. You you
[1:48:44] can't be um uh dressed like a hobo and
[1:48:48] then go ask to be a pilot
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; to fly that plane. The people are going
[1:48:54] to jump off at the moment they see you
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; because your your d and he could
[1:49:00] actually be a pilot dressed as a hobo.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to trust him.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; You understand? All that has to do with
[1:49:09] making your message more efficient, more
[1:49:12] direct, more powerful.
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; But that's got nothing to do with your
[1:49:15] holiness. As in, are you in your heart
[1:49:20] dedicated
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; to the purpose of God?
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; That is holiness.
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:49:29] being washed from a previous purpose
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; to induct you into a new purpose.
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; Washing all previous ambitions and
[1:49:40] purposes away and bringing that's why
[1:49:42] young people that's what it means by be
[1:49:44] baptized with the Holy Ghost means put
[1:49:47] aside your other ambitions.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; It means putting away all other whatever
[1:49:51] your career is. And if you're going to
[1:49:52] have a career, your purpose of God is
[1:49:55] going to be included in your career.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; See, for example, you can't say I'm the
[1:50:01] bride of Christ and I want to be a
[1:50:03] fashion designer.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:50:06] in Milan.
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; How is that possible?
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; How is the purpose of God included in
[1:50:13] that?
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Right? Or I want to be a pastor and a
[1:50:18] full-time fisherman.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; It's it doesn't it doesn't work. It's it
[1:50:24] it doesn't make sense. It it it doesn't
[1:50:27] it doesn't have a a purpose that
[1:50:29] combines.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:50:32] So, Holy Spirit and this is where I want
[1:50:35] to close with. What is then Holy Spirit?
[1:50:39] When we break it down, what does Holy
[1:50:42] Spirit actually mean? If holy has got to
[1:50:45] do with purpose and the purpose of God
[1:50:48] and spirit means divine nature or
[1:50:52] nature, then what we have is the
[1:50:54] purposeful nature.
[1:50:57] How do I know I have the Holy Spirit? I
[1:51:00] have the purposeful nature.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; That's what I want.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; I want my life driven by his purpose.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; I want to know what the purpose of God
[1:51:13] is for this day.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; Now, if I know what the purpose of God
[1:51:17] is for this day, how am I going to be
[1:51:19] blackmailed by somebody who's telling me
[1:51:21] I need to get the Holy Ghost of another
[1:51:23] day?
[1:51:24] How am I going to be pressurized to act
[1:51:26] like something of another day that has
[1:51:28] got nothing to do with the purpose of
[1:51:30] this day?
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; I like
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; you love him.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; So, as we close, what is the purpose of
[1:51:37] your day?
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; And I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:51:43] him, give me the little book. And he
[1:51:44] said unto me, take it.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; And eat it up.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter. So
[1:51:51] you have, if you didn't know about
[1:51:53] something you have to do, here it is.
[1:51:55] Take it and eat it up.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for you.
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter, but
[1:52:01] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[1:52:03] And I took the little book out of the
[1:52:05] angel's hand and ate it up. And it was
[1:52:07] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[1:52:09] as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[1:52:10] We all know that. And verse 11 says,
[1:52:12] "And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy
[1:52:15] again before many peoples and nations
[1:52:18] and tongues and kings." And this is
[1:52:20] where you got people saying, you see, we
[1:52:23] must prophesy. You must speak with
[1:52:25] tongues. No, you must prophesy to many
[1:52:27] tongues.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; That means many languages of the earth.
[1:52:30] You must you must prophesy. You must
[1:52:33] speak
[1:52:35] &gt;&gt; to the world.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; There's your purpose for today. So
[1:52:41] what's the purpose? Take the book,
[1:52:44] speak the word. Yes.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; This has never been given to any other
[1:52:49] age before.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; This is the purpose of the bride today.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; Take the book. Speak the word. There it
[1:52:58] is. So, what is your purpose, young
[1:53:00] people? Speaking the word.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Taking the word.
[1:53:06] Now, this is what I find frustrating
[1:53:09] today
[1:53:10] is that people who are taking the word
[1:53:14] don't seem to be speaking.
[1:53:19] Either you feel pressurized that you're
[1:53:20] not allowed to speak. And I'm not just I
[1:53:22] don't just mean speaking as in with your
[1:53:25] mouth. Of course, you need to. It's
[1:53:28] telling you that the word that you took
[1:53:31] needs to be manifested
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; to all kingdoms and nations and tribes
[1:53:35] and people,
[1:53:38] &gt;&gt; to your neighbor in the street,
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; to the people you come in contact with,
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; I feel like
[1:53:46] it needs to change. That's why we
[1:53:49] feeling like something is missing.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; There needs to be a shift.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; It needs to change. You got Pentecostal
[1:53:56] people, uh, denominational people, they
[1:53:59] they'll meet you somewhere and they'll
[1:54:01] they'll come up to you and say, "Have
[1:54:03] you been saved? Have you been born
[1:54:05] again?" And and you're thinking like,
[1:54:07] "If only you know." And then you walk
[1:54:10] away.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; What happened to your voice?
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; What happened to your testimony?
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; What happened to the witnesses?
[1:54:19] &gt;&gt; How are we going to fill Revelations
[1:54:21] 10:8-11?
[1:54:23] Number one, you can't do it unless you
[1:54:25] take the book.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; And you need the Holy Spirit to be able
[1:54:29] to take the book. The Holy Spirit is the
[1:54:31] one saying, "Take the book, eat it up.
[1:54:33] This is what's going to happen." You
[1:54:35] take that word in, and then you have to
[1:54:37] speak it.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; You know, when I was uh a young man and
[1:54:42] running away from the ministry, a very
[1:54:45] humble minister who brought correction
[1:54:47] to me told me something. He said, "If
[1:54:50] you take the book and eat the book and
[1:54:52] you have this word inside you and you
[1:54:54] are not
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; speaking it, it's going to corrupt you.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; You're going to be like a well that's
[1:55:01] it's got no
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; expression. It's got it's not it's not
[1:55:05] releasing itself." And you and I
[1:55:07] understood what was happening because
[1:55:08] there I was sitting in the in the church
[1:55:10] listening to ministry and I'm and I'm
[1:55:12] sitting there and I can feel the
[1:55:14] thoughts of God coming in and I want to
[1:55:16] express him and I'm sitting there
[1:55:17] thinking but this preacher can go this
[1:55:19] way and he can go that way and he could
[1:55:20] say this and and then it's eating me up
[1:55:23] and then it's like why don't you say it
[1:55:26] and no I'm I'm not I'm too good for that
[1:55:29] pulpit.
[1:55:33] That's eventually what comes to you.
[1:55:34] It's your pride standing in the way to
[1:55:37] humble yourself and speak the word.
[1:55:40] Amen. So you got what they're pushing,
[1:55:43] the agenda they're pushing today outside
[1:55:45] of in in the message is go to these
[1:55:48] camps, go get slain in the spirit, go
[1:55:51] speak with tongues, go jump up and down
[1:55:53] and scream, but are you speaking the
[1:55:56] word? Because the purpose of the day is
[1:55:59] take the book, speak the word.
[1:56:02] We've got to find that. We've I believe
[1:56:05] the church needs to lead us into that. I
[1:56:07] believe the the ministry needs to lead
[1:56:09] us into that. Each one of us needs to
[1:56:11] become speakers. And yes, I know you
[1:56:13] say, you know, brother Al, I'm just a
[1:56:15] housewife. What what do I need to speak?
[1:56:18] Well, you are speaking to your children.
[1:56:21] You're speaking with your husband.
[1:56:24] You're speaking in your life. You're
[1:56:25] speaking with your friends, with your
[1:56:26] families. It's it's got to come to it
[1:56:29] now where your life is speaking, not
[1:56:31] just your words. So, what do I mean by
[1:56:34] life? And I'm not even talking about the
[1:56:35] codes and standards of the message. I'm
[1:56:37] talking about your joy of the word must
[1:56:42] be expressed.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Tell it to your face, saints.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Come on. See, it's got to be that.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; I I love his word. I love his word so
[1:56:53] much. I JUST WANT TO SHARE IT. I WANT TO
[1:56:55] FELLOWSHIP WITH IT. I want unending
[1:56:57] fellowship.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; We've got to be able to see that. Not
[1:57:00] forms of religion, but actual loving the
[1:57:02] word. I can't wait to wake up in the
[1:57:04] morning after my sleep. My sleep is
[1:57:05] wasting my time. You know, I want to
[1:57:07] wake up in the morning, hold my coffee,
[1:57:09] and read the word and and and speak to
[1:57:11] someone, express it today. You know, I
[1:57:14] that's what we want to see in in the
[1:57:16] bride of Christ. That's what we want to
[1:57:17] see among the people.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; As we close this down, testimony of a
[1:57:21] true witness. Paragraph 186. What
[1:57:24] church? What's the That's the reason I
[1:57:27] can't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:29] of crying, shaking, or speaking in
[1:57:31] tongues or any sensation.
[1:57:34] You hear it straight from the prophet.
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; They're all right now. Them things are
[1:57:38] right. But the devil can impersonate
[1:57:41] that. So real.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost is deity.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in men. It's more than a
[1:57:50] sensation. It's more than speaking in
[1:57:52] tongues. is more than shouting IN THE
[1:57:54] SPIRIT. IT'S MORE than weeping. IT'S
[1:57:56] MORE THAN JOINING CHURCH. IT'S God
[1:57:58] living in man. DEITY, GOD HIMSELF
[1:58:01] TABERNACLED into that person. When he
[1:58:04] can speak, it's just the same as God
[1:58:06] speaking.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; There's the call. He wants you to speak.
[1:58:11] That's the church of Jesus Christ.
[1:58:13] That's the way the first apostolic
[1:58:15] church went forth. Amen. That's this is
[1:58:17] what it is. THE PROPHET IS SAYING, "I
[1:58:19] CAN'T TAKE the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:21] of crying, shaking, speaking tongue,
[1:58:23] sensations.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; What I really want to see is God
[1:58:26] tabernacle, deity in men, speaking the
[1:58:29] word."
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:58:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; Uh Corinthians book of correction. We
[1:58:35] notice Paul could teach the Ephesians
[1:58:37] there how that before the foundation of
[1:58:39] the world, they were predestinated unto
[1:58:41] the adoption of sons of God. The
[1:58:43] Corinthians didn't know anything about
[1:58:45] that. They had have a little feeling of
[1:58:47] something, a little sensation, one this
[1:58:49] and that and the other and they depended
[1:58:51] on that. He couldn't teach them the deep
[1:58:54] things.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Here it is. So I think it's great that
[1:58:58] you got people that you can teach deep
[1:59:01] things. Watch this. Taking the word. The
[1:59:04] Holy Spirit can wind these great truths
[1:59:07] and anchor into the people's heart so
[1:59:10] they know where they're standing.
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Sensation and no sensation. Prophecy or
[1:59:15] no prophecy, whatever it might be, take
[1:59:17] the word, speak the word. The prophet is
[1:59:20] telling us, what I really want to see is
[1:59:23] people you can teach the deep things to.
[1:59:26] &gt;&gt; They're not shunning it. They they're
[1:59:28] willing to take it. They're not fighting
[1:59:30] against it. Seven seal is not open. How
[1:59:32] can this be? How can this must happen in
[1:59:35] the future? Uh the church goes up in
[1:59:37] Revelations 3 and comes back in 19 and
[1:59:39] nothing in between is to the bride.
[1:59:42] They haven't received the Holy Spirit.
[1:59:45] They haven't received the Holy Ghost for
[1:59:46] this day.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; They have not responded to it because
[1:59:49] there's no word inside. Nothing's giving
[1:59:52] ability to even push the agenda.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Saints,
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; why do people feel they need sensations?
[2:00:02] Because they feel they need proof.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Others around them also feel they need
[2:00:09] proof. Like I'm the minister. I need to
[2:00:11] see proof that you have the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; It's a private affair.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; It's between me and God.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. But even myself now, why do I need
[2:00:21] proof?
[2:00:23] Faith doesn't need proof.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; I believe first and evidence follows
[2:00:29] whenever it can.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; But I must believe.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; So people feel insecure,
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:00:38] &gt;&gt; They don't they don't understand what's
[2:00:40] going on. They feel they need proof.
[2:00:41] Their feelings are more satisfied when
[2:00:43] they see evidence, visible evidence.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; Why can I not be like brother so and so?
[2:00:49] You know, he's so lucky. He's got a
[2:00:51] gift. He's got this or speaking with
[2:00:53] tongues or prophesying or he dreams
[2:00:55] dreams. She sees dreams or he's he has
[2:00:58] visions. What about me? I got nothing.
[2:01:01] Right? So I I feel insecure. I feel
[2:01:05] inferior. I need something. The truth is
[2:01:08] saints emotions and sensations could
[2:01:11] occur in in a way that reflects a true
[2:01:13] experience. It can the the reason should
[2:01:16] be that the body
[2:01:19] cannot contain the revelation that the
[2:01:21] Holy Spirit brings in you. What I'm
[2:01:22] saying to you is
[2:01:24] there should be some expression.
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; When you get the word, when God convicts
[2:01:29] your heart, there should be an
[2:01:31] expression.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; There should be an amen in your soul.
[2:01:34] And and maybe you're struggling with
[2:01:36] complex or something and you you really
[2:01:38] want to scream out, but you just maybe
[2:01:40] feel like raising your hand for now.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; And maybe you feel like you're a little
[2:01:45] shy that somebody is seeing you or that
[2:01:49] you're afraid that somebody is going to
[2:01:50] say something, but there's something
[2:01:52] happening inside. And then there's other
[2:01:54] people who are just boisterous,
[2:01:57] flamboyant, sanguin people who it's
[2:02:00] their character that when anything
[2:02:02] touches them, they're just jumping,
[2:02:03] screaming, and shouting. It's just
[2:02:05] emotions. It's it's the way they're
[2:02:06] made. They're different. It's emotions.
[2:02:10] It doesn't mean anything
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; to what is going on inside. It's just an
[2:02:16] expression
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; of something.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; But they should be an expression.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That expression indicates the
[2:02:24] worship.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; So the reason it is so dangerous, it is
[2:02:27] because people can have reactions for
[2:02:30] the silliest of things and it's not even
[2:02:33] relevant,
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; right? Anyone can cry because they're
[2:02:36] sorry for what they've done.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; That's good because if you cry and
[2:02:41] you're sorry and you apologize for what
[2:02:43] you've done and you come into church and
[2:02:45] the word convicts you and you cry,
[2:02:47] that's good. It's good that you cry.
[2:02:49] It's good that you come and say, "I'm
[2:02:51] sorry, Lord. I repent. You know, I I
[2:02:53] want to put this right. You come and
[2:02:54] tell the pastor or something. You come
[2:02:56] to the altar and and you raise your
[2:02:58] hands. It's good that you do that. It
[2:03:00] still doesn't mean anything
[2:03:04] unless you have the Holy Spirit in you
[2:03:06] directing you to the word
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; because even a person who does not have
[2:03:10] the Holy Spirit can feel sorry for what
[2:03:12] they did. That's right.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is and always has been
[2:03:20] about the purpose of God.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's the purposeful
[2:03:25] nature.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've had a reaction of
[2:03:29] sensations, then there must be a life of
[2:03:32] purpose that follows.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; All right. I I don't know if I said this
[2:03:39] here before. Most of the people who hit
[2:03:42] the ground in the Bible were
[2:03:44] demonpossessed.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; Those who willingly went down to the
[2:03:50] ground in the presence of the Lord rose
[2:03:52] up and their lives were never the same
[2:03:54] again.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; They woke up with a purpose.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; They didn't go back to an old lifestyle.
[2:04:00] When Moses bowed his head down because
[2:04:02] the ground he was standing on was holy
[2:04:04] and took off his shoe. When he rose up
[2:04:06] from there, he became a deliverer of a
[2:04:08] nation. He didn't go back to sheep
[2:04:10] farming on the mountain.
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says the prophet says
[2:04:14] God found him walking around living a
[2:04:17] life of ease.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; This prophet
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; and then he meets the presence of God
[2:04:23] hits the ground in the presence of God
[2:04:24] wakes up with a purpose.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; So if there is an experience or there is
[2:04:29] an expression or there is some kind of
[2:04:31] experience of the Holy Ghost your life
[2:04:33] must have purpose
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; from there on. Amen.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to see. It is a
[2:04:39] purposeful nature.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that saints?
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; If you had a reaction of sensations,
[2:04:47] there must be purpose. That must be
[2:04:49] evident.
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; Everyone can be anointed with the
[2:04:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the
[2:04:54] earnest. But the Holy Spirit of promise
[2:04:58] does not come upon a person willy-nilly.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; It comes to the elect.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is it has a purpose. It has a
[2:05:07] directive. It leads to something in
[2:05:09] particular. It is the beginning of the
[2:05:11] process of adoption of a son.
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're under tutors and
[2:05:18] governors. Go read Galatians chapter 4.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; A son, as long as he's not come to
[2:05:24] maturity, he's just a servant
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; and he's under tutors and governors. But
[2:05:28] then when it comes to the end, he
[2:05:30] receives the spirit
[2:05:33] of the son,
[2:05:35] not gifts. He was under gifts all the
[2:05:38] time, tutors and governors. But now when
[2:05:41] it comes to the process of adoption to
[2:05:44] take purpose
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the will of the father to
[2:05:50] come into that state of adoption you
[2:05:52] have to have the holy spirit within you
[2:05:55] not an anointing the divine nature the
[2:05:59] purpose of god to fulfill the work of
[2:06:01] the father to be an heir of all things.
[2:06:05] It signifies a closing of being under
[2:06:07] tutors and governors and becoming an
[2:06:09] heir of the promise. Saints,
[2:06:13] if we have the full fullness of the
[2:06:15] word, why do we need the baptism of the
[2:06:18] Holy Ghost in operation? I'm not saying
[2:06:21] you mustn't. I'm asking you a question.
[2:06:23] You say, brother Alistister, okay, look,
[2:06:25] we got the fullness of the word now. We
[2:06:26] got the open book. Doesn't that mean we
[2:06:28] don't need the baptism of the Holy
[2:06:30] Ghost? No. You still need ability. The
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost gives ability
[2:06:35] for the present day.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; So that's what anointing is. It is
[2:06:40] ability. Otherwise, we're just sitting
[2:06:42] around doing nothing,
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; right? With all this word feeding us and
[2:06:46] then sitting around doing nothing. You
[2:06:48] need anointing to incentivize you to
[2:06:51] give you direction what you what you
[2:06:53] need to do. It's like at a certain time
[2:06:55] you meet somebody, I don't know whether
[2:06:57] you use a bus stop here in Lima or
[2:06:59] wherever at the grocery store or
[2:07:00] something and somebody comes up to you
[2:07:02] and they notice something about you,
[2:07:04] something unique and they they seem to
[2:07:06] sense there's something different about
[2:07:07] you and they speak to you right there.
[2:07:09] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:07:11] important
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; because it needs to give you ability
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; to speak to this person to see their
[2:07:16] soul to sense what's going on to speak
[2:07:19] the right word because you in your right
[2:07:21] mind you're still worrying about what's
[2:07:22] happening about the bills about
[2:07:23] something that crashed into your car and
[2:07:26] and right there you're all flustered,
[2:07:28] you're confused, you're looking at a
[2:07:29] pawpaw and wondering whether you should
[2:07:31] buy it and someone comes up and says,
[2:07:34] "Hi, I need some help.
[2:07:38] You need the brement of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:39] to put all those worries away and focus
[2:07:42] your attention because there's something
[2:07:44] calling and there must be a deep to
[2:07:46] respond.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. There always is a need for
[2:07:51] ability.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; But we don't take the ability and make
[2:07:55] it our God.
[2:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is his holy spirit in us which
[2:08:02] is the divine nature that leads us to
[2:08:04] it. So the word is what your soul, if
[2:08:07] you understand who you are, the word in
[2:08:09] your soul is what you are married to.
[2:08:11] This flesh and your mind is not married
[2:08:15] to that word.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; This flesh and this mind needs the
[2:08:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Young people,
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; because this flesh and this body and
[2:08:24] mind has different abilities. In my
[2:08:26] life, I had abilities of playing
[2:08:28] cricket, being a sportsman, doing art,
[2:08:32] playing music. You know, playing music
[2:08:34] is a very dangerous thing. If you if you
[2:08:36] have gift or play by ear, you can pick
[2:08:38] up all sorts of tunes and play it. But
[2:08:40] when you get the Holy Ghost, you're
[2:08:41] going to dedicate that gift to only his
[2:08:43] purpose.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; See, but without the Holy Ghost, you're
[2:08:47] just going to drift anywhere with it.
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; Right? Those abilities need to be
[2:08:51] reigned in to be used for the purpose of
[2:08:54] the word. Amen.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word is what your soul is
[2:09:00] married to. But this animal needs the
[2:09:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; This animal needs the anointing. And the
[2:09:08] anointing is what gives it abilities it
[2:09:10] could not ordinarily have. That's why
[2:09:13] it's important. Anyone can be anointed
[2:09:16] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[2:09:17] which is the earnest. But the Holy
[2:09:19] Spirit of promise comes to the elect.
[2:09:22] You believe him, saints? That's why the
[2:09:24] Holy Spirit is necessary. What is the
[2:09:27] Holy Spirit then? It is the influence of
[2:09:31] the word for your day.
[2:09:35] &gt;&gt; The purposeful nature.
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; Spirit is nature. The Holy Spirit is the
[2:09:41] influence of the word for your day. And
[2:09:44] that influence is going to cause your
[2:09:46] body and your spirit to fall in line
[2:09:49] with the word that you are married to.
[2:09:51] Yes.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's understand that we came into
[2:09:55] this flesh. Uh born in sin, shapen in
[2:09:58] iniquity, come into this world, speaking
[2:10:00] lies as the prophet said. We we uh come
[2:10:04] with our own desires. We have our own
[2:10:06] ideas of things. We have our own way of
[2:10:09] doing things. We sometimes think, well,
[2:10:11] I'm just going to preach this this way
[2:10:12] and you know, people just have to accept
[2:10:14] it and uh this is how I do things. But
[2:10:17] it becomes ineffective unless the Holy
[2:10:20] Spirit is the one guiding us.
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand
[2:10:26] why they wrote it differently in the
[2:10:28] Bible?
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference? Do you
[2:10:31] understand the difference between the
[2:10:33] anointing and the person?
[2:10:36] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference between
[2:10:37] the ability and the purposeful nature?
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Now you need to know when you read the
[2:10:44] word what it is that you have. What it
[2:10:47] is that you seek
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; what it is that God must give to you,
[2:10:51] what it is that you are lacking maybe.
[2:10:53] If you have a desire in your heart to do
[2:10:56] something for the gospel, you need
[2:10:58] ability for that. And you need and God's
[2:11:00] ability is not going to be one that must
[2:11:02] bring failure. It must be a success for
[2:11:05] the kingdom.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're you other a lot of
[2:11:10] people also feel like I want to I want
[2:11:12] to be a preacher but there's just no
[2:11:14] gift there. I want to be a pastor but
[2:11:16] there's just no wisdom in you. I want to
[2:11:18] be a deacon but you're just a big old
[2:11:20] softy who's never going to be able to
[2:11:22] correct anybody.
[2:11:23] And yet in a time of need God can give
[2:11:27] you the Holy Ghost to fulfill that need
[2:11:30] because the word has inspired you beyond
[2:11:33] what you what abilities you have. Yes.
[2:11:36] Sometimes a big old softy can be someone
[2:11:38] who can bring good correction.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; God can do that. Only God can change you
[2:11:43] and people the people will recognize the
[2:11:46] spirit of God has worked in his life.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him saints.
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; This is the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[2:11:53] Spirit. The purposeful nature of God.
[2:11:56] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:02] Glory to God. Let us pray. And the
[2:12:05] musicians can come up.
[2:12:08] Dear heavenly father,
[2:12:10] we love you, Lord, with all that is
[2:12:12] within us.
[2:12:14] We give you praise,
[2:12:16] Lord, because you are more than more
[2:12:20] than worthy of all the praise and the
[2:12:22] glory.
[2:12:23] We love you, Lord. And yet in our our
[2:12:28] minds and our heart,
[2:12:30] Lord, we we may not be able to describe
[2:12:33] it or even to know
[2:12:36] or even define so many things about our
[2:12:38] lives.
[2:12:40] But we know one thing. You sent us a
[2:12:43] perfect word. When we look at where
[2:12:47] we've come from, we are reminded that
[2:12:49] you took us from the sheep coat.
[2:12:52] We were people that nobody knew, nobody
[2:12:55] cared for, nobody
[2:12:59] ever thought that we would amount to
[2:13:02] anything. We're still our people in this
[2:13:04] world. People pass us by. We come to
[2:13:07] this place. We are reminded we are the
[2:13:09] bride of Christ. We are the super race.
[2:13:13] We are the the elect.
[2:13:17] And then we drive around in our vehicles
[2:13:19] and go to the shopping markets and malls
[2:13:23] and nobody knows we even exist. Nobody
[2:13:27] cares.
[2:13:29] There's nothing special about us. And we
[2:13:32] look at this and we think, but Peter and
[2:13:36] Paul and those men walked around and
[2:13:38] there was such a great significance.
[2:13:41] Shouldn't there be something that we
[2:13:42] must do? Shouldn't there be something,
[2:13:44] some effect we must make on the world?
[2:13:48] Lord, we we understand.
[2:13:51] We know the time we are living in. Your
[2:13:53] word has been revealed to us.
[2:13:57] Yet, we know there are the
[2:13:59] denominations, the people on the
[2:14:01] outside. Many others would say, well, if
[2:14:05] you are the the chosen people of God,
[2:14:08] why does nobody listen to you? What are
[2:14:11] you doing for the world? How are you
[2:14:13] changing the world? And it gets to us.
[2:14:16] It convicts us. It makes us feel like we
[2:14:19] have to do something.
[2:14:23] But you know why you chose barren woman
[2:14:28] to be the woman of promise to bring
[2:14:30] forth the seed.
[2:14:33] Lord, we were barren for such a long
[2:14:36] time.
[2:14:38] We were people who could not bring
[2:14:40] forth. We were people who thought it was
[2:14:44] nothing to us
[2:14:46] and others told us that we were
[2:14:48] condemned. We came from families who
[2:14:51] cast us out and persecuted us for what
[2:14:54] we believed.
[2:14:56] But you built us up by your word. You
[2:14:59] brought us the truth. You gave us your
[2:15:02] spirit. You gave us this anointing.
[2:15:05] You gave us your word. You revealed the
[2:15:07] word to us, oh Lord.
[2:15:10] Now we stand before a world and your
[2:15:14] your spirit has shouted out to us. Go
[2:15:17] take the book,
[2:15:19] eat the book, speak the word.
[2:15:24] We know what the purpose is in this last
[2:15:26] days. Lord, I pray I pray for this
[2:15:30] church. I pray for our church. I pray
[2:15:33] for our families. my wife, my children,
[2:15:36] myself,
[2:15:38] my families, my siblings, my friends,
[2:15:42] those of us in in the message.
[2:15:45] Lord, it it looks like we're waiting for
[2:15:48] something to happen.
[2:15:51] We're preaching that something has, but
[2:15:54] it looks like we're waiting on
[2:15:56] something.
[2:15:57] It feels like we're waiting on
[2:15:59] something. And yet, Lord, you have
[2:16:01] commissioned us to do something.
[2:16:05] I pray for the young people. I pray for
[2:16:08] those who have been discouraged. I
[2:16:11] commit us all to you. Lord,
[2:16:14] I am in desperation.
[2:16:17] I am a minister. I'm a pastor of a
[2:16:19] church. But Lord, I need your guidance.
[2:16:23] I need your wisdom. I need your
[2:16:25] strength. I need to know what to do
[2:16:27] tomorrow. I need to do know what to do
[2:16:29] with my life. I need to know what to do
[2:16:31] for the next 10 years of my life.
[2:16:33] should you tarry? What must I do with
[2:16:35] your word? How can I bring this word to
[2:16:38] your people? How can I incentivize your
[2:16:41] children? How can I help to build your
[2:16:44] children up to to bring them to a place
[2:16:46] where they can speak the word fearlessly
[2:16:49] and share this wonderful truth with
[2:16:52] those around them?
[2:16:55] Lord God, I pray that you would anoint
[2:16:58] your children once again.
[2:17:01] Bring that purposeful spirit within us,
[2:17:05] Lord, that we might have direction. We
[2:17:08] might have purpose. That we might be
[2:17:09] holy even as you are holy.
[2:17:12] I want to be committed to your purpose,
[2:17:14] oh God. Not my own agenda, not my own
[2:17:17] ambitions, not my own career. I want my
[2:17:20] will to be aligned with your will.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; I want to have the ability to choose
[2:17:26] your will for my life's path.
[2:17:30] Lord, I don't want to walk my own way. I
[2:17:33] want to be anointed by your Holy Spirit.
[2:17:36] I want to have your Holy Spirit dwelling
[2:17:38] within me and giving me the direction I
[2:17:40] need. Lord God, I pray for all these
[2:17:44] your children bowed in your presence
[2:17:46] today. Anoint us, oh Lord. Bring us to
[2:17:49] that place where we are no longer
[2:17:50] confused, where we are not trapped by
[2:17:53] the enemy to trying to make us think
[2:17:55] that we should have some anointing for a
[2:17:57] different day.
[2:17:59] Lord, make us realize what it is that
[2:18:01] you have for us today.
[2:18:04] Bless us today, Father God, as we leave
[2:18:06] this place. Let these few simple things
[2:18:10] make things clearer for us that we might
[2:18:12] understand, that we might follow behind
[2:18:14] the word for this day. That we might see
[2:18:16] what the anointing should be around the
[2:18:19] word that you have revealed for us.
[2:18:22] Bless the pastor of this church. Bless
[2:18:23] the people. Lord, we all need help. We
[2:18:27] all need strength to continue and we
[2:18:30] believe that you will lead us through to
[2:18:33] the very end. Bless us now, Father. We
[2:18:36] ask it in your precious name with much
[2:18:38] praise and thanksgiving. Amen. And amen.
