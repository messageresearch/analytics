[0:00] So uh we want to speak this morning. We
[0:04] want to read from our scriptures from 2
[0:06] Peter chapter 1 8-10 and also 1 Peter
[0:11] 5:8-10.
[0:13] And then you may take your seats. 2
[0:15] Peter 1 8:10 for so this is um the
[0:19] scripture that speaks of the virtues
[0:23] that uh Peter said add to your faith
[0:25] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience
[0:26] and so on. And then we come to verse 8
[0:29] and where he says,"For if these things
[0:32] be in you and abound, they make you that
[0:36] you shall neither be barren nor
[0:38] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[0:40] Jesus Christ." So everyone with us,
[0:42] &gt;&gt; add your faith, virtue, knowledge,
[0:45] temperance, patience, godliness,
[0:47] brotherly kindness, and charity, which
[0:49] is love. If these things be in you and
[0:52] abound,
[0:54] right? They make you that you shall
[0:56] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[0:58] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. But
[1:00] he that lackth these things is blind and
[1:04] cannot see a far off. I remember we
[1:07] broke these scriptures down to us uh in
[1:10] detail in other series and hath
[1:13] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:15] old sins. So important. Wherefore the
[1:18] rather brethren give diligence to make
[1:21] your calling and election sure. For if
[1:24] you do these things, you shall never
[1:27] fall.
[1:30] 1 Peter 5:8-10.
[1:33] Be sober. Be vigilant. Because your
[1:36] adversary, the devil, as a roaring lion,
[1:40] walketh about, seeking whom he may
[1:42] devour, whom resist steadfast in the
[1:46] faith, knowing that the same afflictions
[1:49] are accomplished in your brethren that
[1:51] are in the world. But the God of all
[1:54] grace, who hath called us unto his
[1:57] eternal glory by Christ Jesus,
[2:00] after that you have suffered a while,
[2:04] make you perfect, establish, strengthen,
[2:08] settle you.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; I love it. The Lord bless you. And the
[2:11] reading of his word, you may be seated.
[2:15] Amen.
[2:18] So once again, greetings to all in his
[2:21] glorious name. So, we want to uh speak
[2:25] this morning um in our subject I I can't
[2:29] seem to stop getting questions, but I'm
[2:32] thankful that the Holy Spirit is leading
[2:34] us in this fashion. So, uh we are going
[2:37] to be doing question and answers on the
[2:39] Holy Ghost and u I know it says the Holy
[2:43] Ghost and sexuality purely because it's
[2:46] linked to the questions are kind of
[2:48] linked to that. I'm getting questions
[2:50] from young people and older people and
[2:52] this is part two. All right. And then
[2:55] for a title, will we ever stop doing bad
[2:59] things? Okay. So, I know that when you
[3:03] when you hear the subject and the title
[3:05] and some of you might think, you know
[3:06] what, we're old people now. We've we've
[3:08] done doing our bad things. Why do we
[3:10] have to sit here in this on a Sunday
[3:12] service and listen to this? Um
[3:16] well there's a reason why that question
[3:19] will we ever stop doing bad things
[3:22] and I can uh stand here today like
[3:24] Christ stood there in that time not
[3:26] because I'm like Christ I'm just saying
[3:28] when he asked the people let him who is
[3:32] without sin cast the first stone I can
[3:35] ask every one of us here today if you if
[3:37] you've ever stopped doing bad things
[3:40] right so there's a reason why this
[3:43] question is important to us. And uh I'm
[3:47] going to read the questions that we're
[3:48] going to get to you in a little while
[3:50] and you'll understand why this is so
[3:52] important to us. So this applies to all
[3:54] of us. Amen. This is not a young
[3:57] people's service. A lot of people uh
[4:01] don't even know what they went through
[4:03] when they came to the new birth. A lot
[4:04] of people don't uh realize and in some
[4:08] ways I think it's a good thing. Uh but
[4:10] we'll talk about that as we go on. So I
[4:12] think the greatest trial that young
[4:15] Christians in the message and when I say
[4:17] young Christians I don't mean youth I
[4:20] mean people who have recently come into
[4:23] the message or come to Christ or people
[4:26] even who have been in the message a long
[4:28] time but the message has just recently
[4:30] dawned on them. You're a young
[4:32] Christian.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. It's got nothing to do with your
[4:35] age. So u the greatest trial with
[4:39] Christians in the message and that you
[4:41] are experiencing right now is the level
[4:44] of condemnation that you feel when you
[4:47] do bad things.
[4:50] That's the greatest problem. If you
[4:52] could do something bad and deal with it
[4:54] where you don't condemn yourself,
[4:56] wouldn't that be better?
[4:58] &gt;&gt; You make mistakes, you do something bad,
[5:01] you feel convicted, you come put it
[5:03] right before God. But if can you imagine
[5:06] what happens to a person when they feel
[5:09] condemnation?
[5:11] Maybe that's a word you've never
[5:13] understood before. Let's put it let's
[5:15] break it down. When you see these are
[5:18] the things that's not in my notes that
[5:19] makes me take longer cuz when I'm here I
[5:21] realize by looking at people's faces
[5:24] that not everyone is getting the impact
[5:26] of what condemnation is. See and this is
[5:30] why it takes longer. So condemnation is
[5:33] when when you know you've done something
[5:35] wrong, but it's affecting you so badly
[5:38] that you are devaluing yourself to the
[5:41] point of feeling like God has forsaken
[5:44] you or you're so filled with guilt and
[5:48] shame that you're feeling like you are
[5:51] you are less than other people in in
[5:53] your church, other people in the
[5:55] message. You are less than brother
[5:56] Alistister. You are less than what the
[5:58] message says. you have let people down.
[6:01] You are not worth it coming to church.
[6:04] That's condemnation.
[6:06] That and then when people look at you in
[6:09] you're interpreting that they're seeing
[6:11] you and criticizing you with their eyes.
[6:13] They may not even think that. They might
[6:15] be looking at how bad your hair is on
[6:17] that day. They're not even thinking
[6:19] about what you done wrong. And um so and
[6:22] yet you're thinking, you go back home
[6:24] and you're thinking, you see how they
[6:25] were looking at me? That's a spirit of
[6:28] condemnation that takes over your being
[6:31] and holds you captive such that you
[6:34] can't pray, you can't read, you can't uh
[6:37] survive prop, you can't work properly,
[6:39] you become depressed. Condemnation is a
[6:42] terrible thing. Condemnation is
[6:44] something that should never be on a son
[6:47] of God. Because no matter what you've
[6:50] done, you should always have a rock that
[6:52] says, "I am a son of God."
[6:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has seen me. He has chosen me.
[6:58] He's so He's seen my pathway. He knew I
[7:01] was going to make this mistake. He knew
[7:02] what I was going to do. And he will make
[7:04] a way to get me out of it.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; That's what should be in the heart of a
[7:08] true son of God.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; So if a a Christian is being subjected
[7:13] to condemnation, it means he's being
[7:16] taught wrong.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Or if he's not being taught wrong, he is
[7:21] misinterpreting what he is taught.
[7:25] All right. So words matter.
[7:29] I don't like to say wrong things. I
[7:32] don't like to say that people are doing
[7:35] wrong things because it's a very and
[7:38] like I say to me words really matter in
[7:41] how we speak it. Like sometimes you know
[7:44] when my family asks me are you angry I
[7:46] say no I'm not angry I'm upset. To you
[7:49] it might be different to no. To me upset
[7:51] and angry is very different. When I'm
[7:53] angry, you don't want to see me, right?
[7:56] And I'll I when I'm angry, I don't want
[7:59] to see you either. So, most likely I'm
[8:00] not going to be there. But if I'm upset,
[8:02] I can deal with you. See, I can be
[8:04] grumpy and my face is pulled up the
[8:06] wrong way and I'm I'm upset. To me, they
[8:08] are totally different things. Words
[8:10] matter. There's a difference between bad
[8:13] things and wrong things.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; Right? With God, anything against his
[8:19] word is wrong
[8:21] &gt;&gt; because there is right and there is
[8:23] wrong.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Okay? But when it comes to matters of
[8:27] the flesh regarding humans, regarding
[8:29] people,
[8:31] it's better to define things as good
[8:33] things and bad things, not right and
[8:35] wrong. Because one person's right is not
[8:39] the same as another person's right.
[8:41] Right?
[8:42] &gt;&gt; And when you try to make the everybody
[8:45] in the message have an exact code of
[8:49] conduct, you have a problem because then
[8:53] no one's ever going to be right.
[8:56] No one's ever everyone is going to be
[8:58] wrong based on it's it's like you've
[9:00] become a denomination. It's like there's
[9:02] no individual growth, right? because
[9:05] you've got people who all want to
[9:08] subscribe to a constitution that must
[9:12] work for everybody and it doesn't work
[9:14] that way. Right?
[9:17] So in other words, let let me explain it
[9:19] this way. You can have two people who
[9:23] are doing the exact same thing, but for
[9:26] one person it's right or good and the
[9:28] other person it's bad.
[9:31] Are you with me? So for one person doing
[9:33] the same thing it is good and yet for
[9:36] the other it is bad. Like for example in
[9:39] terms of sexuality if the act is
[9:41] committed within marriage it is good. If
[9:43] it is committed outside of marriage it
[9:45] is bad. There's nothing wrong with the
[9:49] action because the action is a normal
[9:51] animal mammal action.
[9:56] What makes it bad is it's not within
[9:58] marriage.
[10:00] Are you with me?
[10:02] Right? And why is it bad? It's not just
[10:05] about good or bad. Why is it it's good
[10:07] for people within marriage? Because it
[10:09] increases their bonding. It makes them
[10:11] love one another even better. It's bad
[10:13] for you on the outside because it
[10:15] literally does something to you. It's
[10:18] bad for you.
[10:20] Right? The act is just an act. I know
[10:23] there's a lot of people in the message,
[10:25] a lot of Christians, a lot of mostly
[10:27] people in the message was like, you know
[10:29] what? No, no. That's the the sin of the
[10:31] Garden of Eden. We must, you know, they
[10:33] get this idea that God must totally uh
[10:36] wipe out all feelings for it completely.
[10:39] No, that's I'm sorry, that's delusional.
[10:42] It's not going to happen.
[10:44] There are so many conflicting thoughts
[10:46] in the minds of young people in the
[10:49] message, new Christians in the message
[10:50] today because of the abundance of the
[10:54] word that has been given to us. Right?
[10:56] Let me explain. So Paul says in Romans
[11:00] 7,
[11:01] I was doing well before they told me
[11:04] about sin. I was doing great. I was
[11:06] enjoying my life. I'm just paraphrasing,
[11:09] right? And animating though he was
[11:12] though Paul says I was in sin because I
[11:15] didn't know the law and I didn't know
[11:17] what I was doing was wrong. I was doing
[11:19] great. I was a happy person. I had a
[11:21] smile on my face. I was going to work. I
[11:24] was uh taking care of uh you know my my
[11:27] parents home. I'm just giving you an
[11:29] idea of what was in Paul's head. Before
[11:31] I knew that I was doing something wrong.
[11:33] I was great. I was happy. I was enjoying
[11:35] life. I was not depressed. You know,
[11:38] Paul was known as the depressed apostle.
[11:41] Okay. And then he said, "But when I came
[11:44] to the knowledge that what I did was
[11:47] wrong or sinful, then sin took uh
[11:52] advantage of me and took me prisoner."
[11:55] That that means once I knew that what I
[11:58] was doing was wrong, I became depressed.
[12:01] I was no longer a happy person. It took
[12:04] advantage of me. It brought my failures
[12:06] to me, to my attention, and made me feel
[12:09] condemnation.
[12:11] And I believe he was speaking of us. He
[12:14] he ends off that chapter by saying, "Who
[12:16] can save me from the body of this dead?
[12:18] Oh, wretched man that I am,
[12:22] right?" And because we have now that's
[12:26] Paul's day. What about our day? Look at
[12:29] what the message has done. If Paul felt
[12:32] like a sinner there with things that he
[12:34] did and uh he he got into depression
[12:37] because of what Christ started teaching.
[12:40] What about what the prophet has taught
[12:41] us in this day? It looks like there's
[12:43] nobody that can ever attain any status
[12:46] of being actually good
[12:50] in the message. Everyone is just like
[12:52] this class A sinner.
[12:56] You understand? So we have received the
[13:00] message which has highlighted so many
[13:02] things about life the good and the bad.
[13:05] We are more knowledgeable today than in
[13:07] the days of Paul. This means we live a
[13:10] life in the message of constantly
[13:13] overcorrecting
[13:15] right constant self-examination
[13:19] which really leads to unhappiness in a
[13:21] in a person. If you live a life every
[13:24] day crossexamining yourself,
[13:27] self-examination,
[13:28] um, correcting, self-correcting,
[13:32] excuse me.
[13:35] When you are constantly self-correcting,
[13:37] you are going to become a depressed
[13:38] person.
[13:40] Do I dress this way? Is this shoe right?
[13:43] Is this trousers okay? Is this too
[13:45] tight? Is this too Is my hair too
[13:47] elaborate? Is this color too loud? Is
[13:50] this not right? Am I playing the music
[13:53] too loud? Am I uh am I playing this
[13:56] chord too jazzy? Am I ask I'm I'm trying
[14:00] to reach for different walks of life
[14:02] here, different things that you might
[14:04] do. If you are someone constantly
[14:06] overcorrecting, you are becoming a
[14:08] depressed person because a the human
[14:11] spirit was meant to be free.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; Was meant to worship God in spirit and
[14:17] in truth and with liberty.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Right? So Paul is telling us exactly
[14:23] what we are going through. It means
[14:26] we're living this life in a mindset that
[14:29] we should not be living in. In Romans 7,
[14:32] that is the message Paul is sending us
[14:34] that which is why when he reaches Romans
[14:37] 8, he teaches us it is better to live
[14:40] without condemnation. He says, "So those
[14:43] who live after the spirit are living
[14:44] with conviction, not condemnation, but
[14:47] those who live after the flesh live with
[14:49] condemnation." Is that right? Romans 8.
[14:53] So what has happened in the message
[14:56] is that people have become legalistic to
[14:58] the point of obsession. Now I don't like
[15:02] to throw this word legalistic around
[15:04] loosely because you know we we label
[15:08] people as legalists when they try to
[15:10] keep control of us by rules or if a
[15:13] brother comes and criticize your
[15:14] dressing you say ah he's just a legalist
[15:17] you know but so we're just labeling
[15:20] people about legalism like maybe because
[15:23] they keep rules or they like to stay
[15:25] within the rules or they correct other
[15:27] people but people who do that are
[15:30] usually people who subject other people
[15:33] to rules are usually liberal themselves.
[15:38] You you understand what I'm saying?
[15:40] Somebody who keeps correcting someone
[15:42] else with the rules is usually someone
[15:44] who does not obey the rules secretly in
[15:48] their own life, but they want to when
[15:50] they're outside in public, they need
[15:52] control because that control makes them
[15:55] feel safer.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; Right. Uh, in other words, rules for
[16:00] you, but secretly not for me. That's not
[16:03] really a legalist. That's a fake
[16:05] legalist.
[16:06] Okay? Don't be offended by that, brother
[16:09] or sister.
[16:11] A true legalist is one who lives by the
[16:14] rules himself
[16:16] and lets it take over his being.
[16:20] Every one of those people are unhappy
[16:22] chappies.
[16:25] Very bad. Yeah. You know what I mean?
[16:28] What I'm saying is you see some some
[16:30] people, they come to church, they
[16:31] criticize you at church, but at home
[16:33] they're living liberal
[16:35] uh carefree lives. They do what they
[16:37] want to. It's only in public that they
[16:39] appear legalistic.
[16:42] They're fake. We know they're fake. But
[16:45] the guy who walks around with his his uh
[16:49] his face constantly upside down,
[16:52] constantly overcorrected,
[16:54] that person is actually a legalist,
[16:58] right? He lives under a cloud of
[17:00] condemnation and he doesn't realize that
[17:03] he uh um keeps validating his life by
[17:08] how well he keeps his rules. And that's
[17:11] what these people do. And they don't
[17:13] realize when you live that way,
[17:16] overcorrecting, constantly checking what
[17:18] is right, you know, um it's got to be
[17:21] done this time. Church has to be on
[17:23] time. Church has to be uh songs must be
[17:27] uh 30 minutes, not 30 minutes and or 32
[17:31] minutes, not 30 minutes and 30 seconds.
[17:35] 30 minutes, right? And the preaching
[17:37] must be according to this. And why are
[17:40] we singing more than two hymns? Because
[17:42] in the pro in in the s they said two
[17:44] hymns. Why are we singing three hymns
[17:47] this morning? Now I'm upset. See the man
[17:51] is living. And if you keep all his
[17:53] rules, he doesn't even look happy. He
[17:56] just looks like, okay, it went well.
[17:59] Well done.
[18:02] Are you with me? That's a real legalist
[18:05] right there. He's actually controlling
[18:07] himself by the rules and he's expecting
[18:10] everybody else. Hey, if I can do it, so
[18:12] must so must you. Not so can you. Not so
[18:15] should you. So must you. Right. And uh
[18:20] by and and he's keeping those rules and
[18:22] he doesn't realize the truth is you
[18:25] become an insufferable unlikable person
[18:30] &gt;&gt; and you actually lose the true spirit of
[18:33] worship.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; And then what you're going to do is
[18:36] you're going to stifle other people cuz
[18:38] you have children coming up, right? And
[18:41] children are carefree spirits. And the
[18:43] Bible tells you a simple thing like out
[18:45] of the mouth of babes.
[18:49] Amen.
[18:51] And so when you stifle that that spirit
[18:54] of a childlike approach to God with
[18:58] legalism, you are crushing them.
[19:03] Sometimes you got to let them say amen
[19:05] in the funny way that they do or they
[19:07] say it too loud or they, you know, uh,
[19:10] express themselves weirdly. You've got
[19:12] to allow that.
[19:14] You know, if you stand there, no, that's
[19:15] not the way it should be done.
[19:18] Okay? If you live your life with the
[19:21] mindset of every day self-correcting
[19:24] yourself, you will eventually leave the
[19:27] faith.
[19:28] I'm not saying you leave church, you'll
[19:30] be sitting in church, but you've left
[19:31] the faith.
[19:33] And eventually you might even leave
[19:35] church completely. The human mind and
[19:38] body cannot handle constant
[19:42] selfcorrection.
[19:44] The the body will get sick. Okay,
[19:47] imagine the spiritual body.
[19:50] Same thing.
[19:53] This is quite clear and evident to me.
[19:55] The Lord Jesus Christ did not come to
[19:57] put us into that kind of lifestyle. When
[20:00] I see his first coming and how he broke
[20:02] all their rules and crushed it all to
[20:05] the ground, literally went into the
[20:07] temple and whipped it into shape.
[20:10] You say he was being legalistic. No, he
[20:13] was actually stopping their legalism.
[20:18] Legalism was like, you know how I'll
[20:20] tell you how it started in the temple.
[20:22] You got some people coming in and
[20:24] they're bringing uh their lamb or their
[20:27] bullock for a sacrifice and the priest
[20:29] say no no no this is unacceptable. What?
[20:31] How can you bring? Surely you could come
[20:32] with a better lamb. So what happened was
[20:34] they took the law and the law was
[20:36] speaking about this flawless lamb and
[20:38] yet to this person they brought up their
[20:41] flawless lamb. No, no, no. Thank you.
[20:42] Thank you. We will breed the right breed
[20:45] of sheep here. We will bring we will
[20:47] sell it to you. Just bring the money to.
[20:49] That's how legalism started. Before you
[20:51] know it, you had money changes happening
[20:54] in the church. That's how legalism came
[20:56] in.
[21:00] A lot has come from the recent things we
[21:02] have taught on sexuality and the Holy
[21:04] Ghost teachings. And I've received some
[21:07] questions which I am able to address on
[21:09] a Sunday morning platform. But other
[21:11] questions I just want to let you know.
[21:13] Um some of the other questions I would
[21:16] rather address in a different manner on
[21:18] a different platform or something
[21:21] because um it's obviously I would say
[21:24] not so edifying if I've got to do it on
[21:27] a Sunday morning. So let's begin with
[21:30] this and with this understand okay let's
[21:33] not kid ourselves.
[21:36] If youth who come to church, are we are
[21:39] we listening?
[21:41] &gt;&gt; And and please when I say youth, let's
[21:44] try and apply it to ourselves too.
[21:47] If youth who come to church and they're
[21:49] just like you adults, they worship in
[21:52] service, they read their Bibles, they
[21:55] listen to the message, they raise their
[21:57] hands in prayer, and are they are asking
[22:00] for overcoming in their lives. Did you
[22:02] hear all I said before? They come to
[22:04] church every service. They worship in
[22:07] the service. They read their Bibles.
[22:08] They listen to the message. They raise
[22:09] their hands. They ask for prayer. And
[22:12] they want us. They're telling us they
[22:15] need overcoming power. Overcoming power
[22:17] in their lives. What are they asking
[22:19] about? They're not on drugs. They're not
[22:23] on alcohol.
[22:25] We know instantly what it's really
[22:27] about. And it's not as if we don't know
[22:30] what the trial of youth is. Okay.
[22:33] They are at the stage of their lives
[22:35] when they are being sexually prepared
[22:38] and driven by their bodies to find
[22:41] partners and bring forth children.
[22:43] That's not a mystery to us. We know what
[22:46] the trial of their age group is. They
[22:48] themselves should realize you can't fool
[22:50] us because we were there once. We know
[22:53] what your trial is. Okay? So, we don't
[22:56] want to go around acting like we don't
[22:58] know what your trial is. Like, and and
[22:59] with the adults, it's like let's let's
[23:01] ignore it. Let's uh let's assume like
[23:03] it's not happening.
[23:06] Parents, please don't be fools.
[23:10] The day your children reach a stage of
[23:12] puberty, you must know they are starting
[23:15] to be attracted to other people. What is
[23:17] your plan to deal with that?
[23:20] You're going to walk around like they're
[23:21] still your infants that you're feeding
[23:23] milk to or you're packing their lunches
[23:26] and giving them lollipops.
[23:29] Hey, or tinkies.
[23:31] No, they they've long since stopped
[23:33] being your little babies. They're now
[23:36] starting to be attracted to other
[23:37] people, which means they're going to
[23:38] start get angry with you very often. We
[23:43] know this.
[23:45] Parents, you need a plan. You can't act
[23:47] like this is not happening.
[23:50] No, this cannot happen. What are you
[23:52] saying? You are saying they can't be
[23:53] attracted to other people. Are you
[23:56] saying it's impossible for your child to
[23:59] have those feelings? No, it's going to
[24:02] happen. And the more you act like it
[24:04] should not happen, the harder it's going
[24:06] to be for them because they're going to
[24:08] do it in secret.
[24:11] Okay? So, when you apply pressure on
[24:15] them to force them to act like it's a
[24:18] secret, that's when all the trouble
[24:20] starts happening. Inner turmoil,
[24:22] condemnation.
[24:24] They're unable to deal with natural
[24:26] feelings,
[24:28] natural process.
[24:30] Like my dad was so weird, you know, when
[24:33] I was in college, he said, he comes to
[24:34] me, he says, "So, did any any girls get
[24:36] fresh with you?" I'm like,
[24:39] "What is get fresh? That's a bubble gum
[24:41] to me." You know, and I I don't want to
[24:44] talk about this. He said, "You know what
[24:45] I'm talking about, man. I'm a bit old
[24:47] school, but you know, you know what I'm
[24:49] I'm saying." It's like, "Uh, no, that he
[24:53] says, "Well, if they do, what will you
[24:55] do?"
[24:57] I I I don't know. What am I supposed to
[25:00] do? That's when we started having a
[25:02] conversation,
[25:04] right? Get fresh. It's a bubble gum. To
[25:06] me, it's a bubble gum. Come on. It's a
[25:08] very nice bubble gum. You remember those
[25:10] get freshes? There was the square things
[25:12] with gel inside. Really tasty gel. But I
[25:15] don't know. That was from his days. You
[25:16] know that time they were get fresh and
[25:19] it was making them dizzy. And you
[25:21] remember those stupid songs they had?
[25:24] And yeah, it was crazy times then. So
[25:27] they are um so now with children in the
[25:31] message the way things are being
[25:33] presented they are being made to feel
[25:34] ashamed for having such feelings to the
[25:38] point of as if it's unholy before God.
[25:41] This is the reason why I'm talking about
[25:43] this is because the question is coming
[25:44] up. Is it unholy to have these these
[25:47] emotions, these feelings, these
[25:49] imaginations, these dreams, right? They
[25:52] are being made to feel that it is
[25:54] impossible to live a life where you
[25:57] don't have these feelings. It's like
[26:00] okay, if if I have these feelings, if I
[26:02] have these thoughts, if I have these
[26:04] imaginations, this is it. I'm done for.
[26:06] I'm I'm stressed. I'm I'm I'm unholy. I
[26:09] can't come to church. I can't pray. I'm
[26:11] a sinner.
[26:14] All right. When these feelings are
[26:16] portrayed as a sin, they become hidden.
[26:19] They become secret and they become out
[26:21] of control. And that's when they become
[26:23] dangerous. Then they are linked. You
[26:26] know, in other words, they link these
[26:28] natural instinct
[26:30] instincts and urges the so the
[26:34] ministries and the message link these
[26:36] things to the Holy Ghost. That's why I'm
[26:38] getting the questions bringing them
[26:40] together. It's like if you have the Holy
[26:42] Ghost you won't have this.
[26:45] Now it's a problem which means if I do
[26:47] then I don't have the this is we are
[26:49] logical people and the more we are
[26:51] educated in mathematics the more likely
[26:53] we are going to be reasonable logical
[26:55] and say well if that's what they're
[26:57] preaching if I still have these feelings
[26:59] and these weaknesses then I don't have
[27:01] the Holy Ghost and so I want the Holy
[27:03] Ghost to overcome this so I don't have
[27:05] to be this way. That's the wrong reason
[27:07] to want the Holy Ghost to start with.
[27:12] See, we don't I don't want the Holy
[27:14] Ghost as a quick fix for my problems.
[27:18] Amen. So, let's get to question one.
[27:23] Um,
[27:25] and question one is
[27:28] uh the the subject of question one is
[27:31] the Holy Ghost baptism only after the
[27:34] sanctification stage. versus total
[27:37] deliverance only after Holy Ghost
[27:40] baptism. In other words, um do we get
[27:43] the Holy Ghost only after we've come
[27:45] through the sanctification stage? There
[27:46] might be some believers here thinking,
[27:48] "What's a sanctification stage? And did
[27:50] I even go through this? How do I know if
[27:52] I went through that?" Right? And then
[27:56] versus total deliverance after the Holy
[27:59] Ghost baptism. In other words, do I only
[28:00] get total deliverance from these
[28:03] weaknesses after I get the Holy Ghost?
[28:06] What do I do up to then or do I have to
[28:10] be uh cleaned of all these weaknesses
[28:14] before I get the Holy Ghost? Are you
[28:16] getting it?
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, that's the subject and this
[28:19] this person actually gave me subjects
[28:22] and then the questions. All right. So,
[28:24] let's go to the question. Question one.
[28:28] The main question here is do we have to
[28:31] live a sanctified life first to get the
[28:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost? If their
[28:37] answer is yes, then how long should we
[28:39] live in a sanctified state before we can
[28:42] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost?
[28:44] And is it even possible to overcome sin
[28:48] without having the baptism of the Holy
[28:50] Ghost? So once again I just want to let
[28:52] you know I've spoken to this person and
[28:54] ask them can I do your question on
[28:57] Sunday and uh look at your question if
[29:00] there's anything you want to edit that
[29:02] you want to take out I've taken out
[29:03] personal names and things like that is
[29:05] there something and the person has given
[29:07] me full authority to do this okay I just
[29:11] want to keep letting you know because I
[29:13] don't want it to be said you know I
[29:14] shared this brother Alistister and then
[29:15] he put it up for the world to see starts
[29:18] talking what we do we deal with these
[29:20] things very careful. So the person says,
[29:22] I'll give my example briefly. I was
[29:25] dealing with a habit for about 7 to 8
[29:27] years. I used to try to overcome it. I
[29:29] believe this message. I believe in God
[29:31] and brother Brandon to be the prophet.
[29:33] But still couldn't overcome that bad
[29:35] habit. I realized that I did not have
[29:38] the Holy Ghost and I was seeking it
[29:40] around 5 to 6 years. I started believing
[29:44] that I'll have to first live in a
[29:46] sanctified life before getting the Holy
[29:48] Ghost. But the sanctification never came
[29:52] with my own efforts and eventually I
[29:55] backslid from church for around one
[29:58] year. Right? So the sanctification never
[30:00] came with my own efforts. This is a
[30:03] problem because I believe that there's a
[30:06] wrong identification
[30:09] of sanctification. That's the problem,
[30:12] right?
[30:13] And uh when I came back uh eventually I
[30:16] backslid from church for around one year
[30:18] and when I came back one day I repented
[30:21] with all my heart and I received the
[30:23] Holy Ghost. One day I repented with all
[30:25] my heart and I received the Holy Ghost.
[30:28] From that day that habit hasn't had a
[30:30] stronghold on me and I've had sweet
[30:32] communion with the Lord which I do not
[30:34] which I did not experience before. In my
[30:38] case, I did not live a sanctified life
[30:42] before getting the Holy Ghost. Even a
[30:45] day before that event,
[30:48] I was living in sin. I didn't have a
[30:51] desire to receive the Holy Ghost. Can
[30:52] you please clarify this confusion?
[30:56] Whenever brother Ben Brandham explains
[30:58] the stages of new birth like
[31:00] sanctification, justification,
[31:01] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[31:03] Ghost, isn't he speaking about the
[31:05] church ages or is he mentioning that an
[31:08] individual too has to go undergo the
[31:12] first two stages before he could receive
[31:14] the Holy Ghost? Also in total
[31:16] deliverance, brother Benham mentions
[31:18] that total deliverance can only come
[31:20] after the token is applied that is the
[31:23] Holy Ghost baptism. He expresses a
[31:25] similar idea in how can I overcome and a
[31:28] few others.
[31:30] What an amazing question, right? And
[31:33] there's three of them. This is only one.
[31:36] So this is exactly some of the
[31:38] confusions that when I was speaking
[31:40] recently in Canada and in youth meetings
[31:42] and this is exact confusions I'm talking
[31:44] about that I've spoken about concerning
[31:47] how receiving the Holy Ghost is taught
[31:50] in churches. Are you with me? M these
[31:53] are the exact questions that young
[31:55] people ask and why and to me this is so
[31:58] beautiful because these are even
[32:00] questions in the mind of parents
[32:03] you know fathers mothers who are
[32:05] concerned for their children because
[32:06] you're seeing the problem in the home
[32:08] you don't want to approach the church
[32:10] and you're you're waiting to feel like
[32:12] to see whether you can deal with it as a
[32:14] parent you're giving them space you're
[32:16] working up to a point you're seeing
[32:17] whether you can you can deal with it or
[32:19] you can help them or something and and
[32:21] you don't know whether what you're doing
[32:23] is right and before you know it 5 years
[32:25] have passed and you feel like oh my
[32:26] goodness I should have come and told the
[32:28] pastor soon as if the pastor was going
[32:30] to solve your problem right so these are
[32:34] the questions they ask and and why when
[32:36] they leave youth meetings and
[32:38] evangelical services they go away
[32:40] confused and some of them are in such a
[32:43] spiritual emotional state believing I
[32:46] have deliverance brother and then they
[32:48] fall again the next
[32:52] Right? This is what we want to try to
[32:54] avoid. So if they go back now after
[32:58] they've come from this beautiful
[33:00] spiritual anointed youth meeting or
[33:03] something where they felt they received
[33:05] the Holy Ghost and then they go back
[33:07] home and the next week they fall again,
[33:11] they make a mistake, right? they go back
[33:14] to doing something wrong and then now
[33:16] they're confused because what happened
[33:18] to the experience I had. Yes. And um
[33:22] they're going to be asking, "Did I do
[33:25] something wrong? Did I not get the Holy
[33:27] Ghost? What happened?" And then they
[33:30] they go to the the minister or whoever
[33:32] preached to them and maybe they feel
[33:34] like I don't want to confess or if I
[33:36] confess I'm going to be told I didn't do
[33:38] it right or something. So we would like
[33:42] to settle these things. This is not just
[33:44] for young people but it's also for us.
[33:47] What we have in this question is an
[33:49] actual account of somebody who who
[33:52] received in other words we've got actual
[33:54] data right of someone who actually
[33:57] received full deliverance and who tells
[34:00] us the day before I received full
[34:02] deliverance I was not even living a
[34:04] sanctified life. I was still backslided
[34:07] and then I came and this one day I
[34:10] received now other people listening to
[34:12] this think oh I want that day I want
[34:13] that day Lord make that day today Lord
[34:16] help me have that day I really want this
[34:18] full deliverance that this person is
[34:19] talking about
[34:22] basically what this person is saying was
[34:24] I reached there without even trying. I
[34:26] was living backsliding for seven to
[34:28] eight years and searching for the Holy
[34:31] Ghost and then I came without even
[34:32] trying it happened
[34:36] right and you know we get so many
[34:37] different kinds of people a lot of
[34:40] people feel it's got to be that way
[34:42] other people feel you've got to follow
[34:44] the rules right the rules are water
[34:47] baptism justification sanctification go
[34:50] through the process you know all of
[34:52] those things and then reach them it's
[34:54] got to be that way and those people who
[34:56] who came that way look at this other
[34:58] person and say that's so unfair you know
[35:00] he just lived his life that way he
[35:02] reached there and suddenly he's he's got
[35:04] the Holy Ghost and full deliverance so
[35:06] unfair
[35:07] so we want to settle this right for all
[35:10] of us what we have in this question is
[35:13] actual data
[35:15] right actual data here is a person you
[35:18] literally and I love this because people
[35:19] who who share these things with us
[35:21] actually tell us this is what happened
[35:24] this is how it happened to me that's
[35:25] what I like about testimonies. They give
[35:27] us data, right? So, you with me? And so,
[35:30] a person here receiving full total
[35:33] deliverance in one day and then that
[35:36] stayed with them since then and they
[35:39] after they've received total deliverance
[35:41] without having lived a sanctified life
[35:43] the day before. Incredible, right? So,
[35:47] there are a few things there where the
[35:50] problem lies. The first is the
[35:52] interpretation of sanctified life. Okay,
[35:56] young people listen up. Older people
[35:59] listen up.
[36:01] Okay. The second thing is the
[36:03] interpretation of total deliverance.
[36:07] What do you mean by total deliverance?
[36:11] All right. The third thing is making a
[36:16] onesizefitsall
[36:18] process of deliverance and receiving the
[36:20] Holy Ghost. In other words, this is how
[36:23] it must be for everybody. It's a
[36:24] one-sizefits-all thing. You know, like
[36:27] when you go to a Pentecostal church and
[36:29] you've come out from the world and
[36:30] you've been a sinner or something and
[36:32] they tell you, you come, you say these
[36:36] words and it'll tell you the sinner's
[36:38] prayer or uh Lord Jesus, I've been a
[36:40] sinner. I accept you as my Lord and
[36:42] Savior and I I I I promise um to repent
[36:46] of my ways. I'm repenting right now. I
[36:48] want to uh be waterbaptized and receive
[36:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I accept
[36:53] the Trinity of the Father, the Son, the
[36:55] Holy Ghost and you know all these things
[36:57] and and you just say those things and
[36:59] then the person the the pastor and the
[37:01] elders come around you and they pray.
[37:03] It's a process and they believe in the
[37:05] process and they make you believe in the
[37:07] process and you convince yourself it's
[37:09] the process.
[37:12] Does that work in the message? Message.
[37:14] Do we have a uh sinner's prayer?
[37:18] And a lot of people think we should a
[37:20] lot of people think it will be easier if
[37:23] we have a clearcut process.
[37:26] Those are those legalists,
[37:29] right? Then we have other people just
[37:31] jump around saying no no no. It must
[37:32] just be the Holy Spirit must fall and
[37:35] you know no process involved. Okay. So
[37:39] this idea, are you listening?
[37:42] &gt;&gt; This idea of having a onesizefitsall
[37:46] program of deliverance and receiving the
[37:48] Holy Ghost, do you know what that
[37:50] produces?
[37:52] Imposters.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Graham calls it programs.
[37:58] Right? It's where you when you have a
[38:01] program or a process, you put upon the
[38:04] people a spirit of religion. And what is
[38:07] that? a white horse rider.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; And a white horse rider is an impostor.
[38:13] He's a person who has a cloak of
[38:15] religion, but actually no arrows,
[38:19] just a a bow. Absolute no offense. He's
[38:23] got nothing to attack the enemy. He's an
[38:26] impostor. He's He's dressed in a white
[38:29] robe and he's got a crown that is given
[38:31] to him.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; That's what religious programs produce.
[38:36] Are you with me? Amen.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; So that's exactly what happens with
[38:40] these so-called Holy Ghost programs.
[38:42] They breed impersonation.
[38:45] Now here's the thing. People are
[38:47] generally good people.
[38:50] Okay? I I've traveled in many places in
[38:53] this world, all over this country, been
[38:55] in all the conventions and combined
[38:57] meetings and I've met message people. I
[38:59] want to tell you they are all genuinely
[39:02] good people.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; They don't want to be bad. They want to
[39:06] come to church. They're just simple.
[39:08] They want to come to church. They want
[39:10] to hear the word. They want to serve
[39:11] God. They want to change their lives.
[39:12] They want to be They genuinely want to
[39:15] be better people. Genuinely want that.
[39:17] Are you with me?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Your children as well.
[39:21] The problem is when you get into a group
[39:23] of people,
[39:25] you immediately feel judged.
[39:28] Even if the people are not judging you,
[39:30] you're looking around and you're you're
[39:32] judging yourself based on what other
[39:34] people do, how they sing, how they pray,
[39:37] what they act like. You when you get
[39:40] into a group of people, you immediately
[39:42] feel judged without anyone judging you,
[39:46] right? and uh other people have you you
[39:49] look at other people you see their
[39:50] families you see their children come in
[39:52] they're all well-dressed they're very
[39:54] well behaved and so on and you think
[39:57] well look at these people they're so
[39:58] well put together you know they're not
[40:00] going through problems like we are and
[40:02] you feel like you know what I can't let
[40:05] them know what I'm going through because
[40:07] then I'm going to let them down if I
[40:08] tell them what I'm what I'm suffering
[40:10] with and you know my trials and uh what
[40:12] you are going through or that you have
[40:14] any weaknesses you don't want to tell
[40:16] them the only reason you feel that way
[40:19] is because of these programs
[40:22] because the way it's presented.
[40:26] Okay, I want to go to the first question
[40:30] and I want to put that down for you.
[40:32] Right? Remember the subject of the
[40:34] question is, do you get the Holy Ghost
[40:37] only after living a sanctified life or
[40:40] do you only get total deliverance after
[40:43] receiving the Holy Ghost baptism? That's
[40:45] the question. Are you with me?
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Everyone together.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; So question one is, do we have to live a
[40:53] sanctified life first to get the baptism
[40:56] of the Holy Ghost? What do you think? So
[40:58] to answer this question, we have to
[41:01] first deal with the misconception of a
[41:03] sanctified life. That's why I said this
[41:05] is for all of us.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:08] Because people who come in the message,
[41:11] some of you been in the message like 30,
[41:13] 40 years, still don't know what it means
[41:15] to be a sanctified life. And some of you
[41:17] been in the message 30, 40 years and
[41:19] started making mistakes or even
[41:20] backsliding and now uh like you're
[41:23] you're you're discouraged and you're
[41:25] thinking, did I receive sanctification
[41:28] in the first place?
[41:32] Another common term for sanctified life
[41:35] is a holy life. Have you heard people
[41:37] speak enough of you? You live a holy
[41:39] life. Is that right? You know, we sing
[41:41] songs like that. Listen to the song. If
[41:44] I live a holy life, shun the wrong and
[41:47] do the right, I know the Lord will make
[41:49] a way for me.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; That's conditional.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:54] &gt;&gt; So the Lord's going to make a way for me
[41:56] if I live a holy life. Shun the wrong
[41:58] and do the right. We literally write
[42:00] songs. So that means the Lord will not
[42:02] make a way for me if I don't live a holy
[42:04] life.
[42:07] That's literally what we're singing.
[42:11] There's nothing wrong with that song.
[42:13] You just need to understand what holy
[42:15] life means.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; You understand? That's the problem is
[42:20] that people don't understand what is
[42:21] sanctified life, what is a holy life. So
[42:24] does it really mean then that a person
[42:27] has to completely get rid of every bad
[42:31] thing in their life? You have to get rid
[42:35] of every wrong thing. But bad things can
[42:38] be there for a long time. Okay. Do I
[42:41] have to get rid of every bad thing in
[42:43] the in my life to receive the Holy Ghost
[42:46] and before getting deliverance?
[42:49] That's that's the real question. So I
[42:52] have explained this to our people many
[42:55] times and yet I you know not our people
[42:58] I've explained this to people many times
[43:01] and yet the spirit this this nature this
[43:04] understanding
[43:06] that they have is so strong that people
[43:08] keep forgetting and keep falling back uh
[43:11] into the same trap where the enemy
[43:14] blackmails you and keeps you hostage.
[43:16] Right? A holy life. Are you all
[43:19] listening?
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. A holy life has got nothing to do
[43:25] with whether you can keep rules.
[43:30] Okay? A a holy life has got nothing to
[43:33] do with whether you have the ability to
[43:37] keep yourself from bad things or what we
[43:41] call wrongdoings.
[43:45] Sanctified life has nothing to do with
[43:47] that.
[43:50] Okay. There are so many people who are
[43:52] not Christians or believers who are able
[43:56] to do these things without having the
[43:59] Holy Ghost
[44:01] and without listening to a single word
[44:04] of God.
[44:06] Does that mean they have a holy life?
[44:09] That is a good life. That is a righteous
[44:12] life.
[44:13] That's not a holy life.
[44:16] Please saints, we have to know the
[44:18] difference between a holy life and a
[44:20] righteous life.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; There there's literally a scripture in
[44:24] in in Solomon's uh books that says do
[44:28] not be overrighteous and do not be over
[44:30] wicked.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. There's a difference between
[44:35] living a righteous life and a holy life.
[44:39] A righteous life is doing everything
[44:41] right.
[44:44] That doesn't mean you're holy.
[44:47] That means you're righteous. But is it
[44:49] good to be righteous? Absolutely.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; It's very advantageous to be righteous.
[44:56] In other words, it it's it'll work well
[44:58] for you if you do everything right.
[45:02] Are you still with me?
[45:04] &gt;&gt; So now I'm I'm putting it in here for
[45:06] the young people and for new people. I
[45:08] want you to know a holy life
[45:13] means a life committed to the faith of
[45:17] the word for your day.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; There's the definition. A holy life is a
[45:26] life committed by faith in the word for
[45:31] your day.
[45:34] That means you now I'm I'm I'm defining
[45:37] it even further for you. You can be a
[45:40] person that has many bad things in your
[45:43] life, but because you are committed to
[45:46] the faith in the word for your day, you
[45:49] are holy unto the Lord.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Alistister can't be.
[45:57] You can be a person who is faultless to
[46:00] the public eye and faultless to yourself
[46:03] when you look in the mirror where your
[46:06] even your own conscience doesn't condemn
[46:08] you. Yet you have re you have only
[46:11] achieved righteousness without faith in
[46:14] the world.
[46:16] I I I've had uh relatives who told me,
[46:21] you know, Alistister, I I I see your
[46:24] religion. I see the way you live. I I I
[46:26] see you going to church, but I'm a good
[46:29] person. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I
[46:31] don't curse. I forgive people. I give to
[46:34] charity. I don't need religion. I don't
[46:36] need God. I don't need And I look at
[46:38] them, I say, "You're right. You're
[46:41] living great. You're dressed well. You
[46:43] don't walk around flirting with every
[46:45] single person. You You're not
[46:47] fornicating. You're not committing
[46:48] adultery. I get it. You're faithful to
[46:50] your husband or your wife. You you're
[46:52] bringing up your children with good
[46:54] manners. In every single sense, you are
[46:56] a righteous person, but you don't know
[46:59] God.
[47:01] You are righteous, but not holy.
[47:04] Are you with me?
[47:06] &gt;&gt; So why is it when we come in the
[47:08] message, we are telling people that
[47:11] righteousness is holiness?
[47:15] Why are you making this confusion?
[47:17] Because you are confusing the young
[47:19] people.
[47:22] This is the reason that uh a person who
[47:26] who asked the question or gave the
[47:28] testimony not even knowing what they
[47:30] experienced
[47:32] so so living a life of backslideness
[47:36] received deliverance the day after
[47:42] on one condition they are so they are so
[47:45] made they they kind of they made a true
[47:47] commitment to God the day after living
[47:50] in absolute unrighteousness,
[47:52] made a commitment the next day and
[47:54] received the Holy Ghost.
[47:57] There was no conditions. It's like um if
[48:01] you and I are a parent and and um your
[48:05] child who's been living in like an
[48:07] absolute roter for 5 years comes to you
[48:09] the next day and says, "Dad, I'm
[48:11] changed. What do you do?
[48:16] Dad, I I'm a new man.
[48:20] He'll be like, "You know what? Mom and I
[48:22] need to talk about this. I'm a new man,
[48:24] Dad. Can I drive your car?"
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Obviously had like 10 crashes with his
[48:28] car. You know, alcohol and I'm a new
[48:31] man, Dad. I've committed my life to God.
[48:33] And mom and I, God, maybe God is looking
[48:36] at you and thinking, "Oh, yes, he's a
[48:38] new man." But mom and I, Hold on. We
[48:40] We're not there yet.
[48:44] Right?
[48:46] &gt;&gt; You see, this is the thing. It's it's
[48:48] our nervousness.
[48:51] We're we're projecting our nervousness
[48:53] as if it is God's nervousness.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Yet God looked at that that young person
[49:00] and said he was in filth yesterday. He
[49:04] came today. He made a genuine full
[49:07] confession and repentance and God gives
[49:09] him the Holy Ghost irrespective of what
[49:12] he did the day before. Yeah,
[49:14] &gt;&gt; you and I will be thinking, hold on, we
[49:16] need some trial here, buddy.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; We need to see some responsibility. I'm
[49:20] like that. I'm not just going to accept
[49:22] this. I need to see some responsibility
[49:24] first. I need to see some maturity. I
[49:27] can't just accept your word for it.
[49:30] See,
[49:32] so that is the reason that this person
[49:35] who asked the question gave such a
[49:37] testimony. They didn't even know what
[49:39] they experienced, right? They just came.
[49:42] They were backsliden. They came into the
[49:44] presence of God. Something dawned on
[49:46] them. They committed their life and
[49:48] received the Holy Ghost and never went
[49:50] back to that life.
[49:52] I know of people who have been addicts
[49:54] to to cigarettes or or or drinking or
[49:57] something and they suffer for years
[49:59] trying to give it up, give it up, give
[50:00] it up and then they meet God and they
[50:03] give it up in one day and the taste is
[50:06] gone from them to the point where if
[50:08] they even smell the smoke, they get
[50:10] annoyed. It's like God has totally taken
[50:13] it out. And then there's some people who
[50:16] will come into the message and still
[50:18] struggle with it for a while. They
[50:19] accept the word. They're loving the
[50:21] word. They they're listening to it.
[50:22] They're saying amen. They're worshiping
[50:24] God. They're praying. They're reading
[50:25] their Bibles. They still can't get
[50:27] deliverance from it. And one day it hits
[50:31] them and it's gone.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; But they're working at it. They're
[50:34] working at it. They're confessing and
[50:36] say, "Brother, you know, I'm still
[50:38] having this problem." I'm saying grow.
[50:40] Just listen to the word. just keep I'm
[50:42] not forcing them. You need to stop it
[50:43] today. Now I'm I'm telling them, okay,
[50:46] thank you. I understand. I'm praying for
[50:48] you. I'm with you. I keep in touch with
[50:49] you. I ask you, you know, how you doing?
[50:52] Are you are you overcoming? Keep in
[50:54] touch with you. As long as you're
[50:55] working with me, I'm working with you.
[50:57] And then someday you tell me, I've had
[50:59] the victory. You get some people who are
[51:03] able and God gives it to them and they
[51:05] overcome it and others are working
[51:06] through it.
[51:10] So that's what needs to be taught to our
[51:12] young people. In simple answer to the
[51:15] question, do you need to have a
[51:17] sanctified life first?
[51:20] Yes.
[51:21] Their answer is yes. Do you need to have
[51:24] a sanctified life to live to receive the
[51:27] Holy Ghost? The answer is yes.
[51:30] But what is the sanctified life? Okay,
[51:34] I'm not saying you must have a faultless
[51:36] life. I'm not saying you can't have bad
[51:39] things in your life, but you need to be
[51:41] sanctified. What is to be sanctified? To
[51:43] be totally committed to God's word, to
[51:46] the faith of God's word for your day.
[51:50] So you can be struggling with failures,
[51:52] but be committed. That's sanctification.
[51:58] That means the person on the inside of
[52:02] you has made a conscious commitment. and
[52:05] and I'm going to back up everything I've
[52:07] said to you with what the prophet said.
[52:10] Okay? Are you with me? So, the person on
[52:13] the inside of you must make a conscious
[52:16] commitment in the soul of being united
[52:18] with the word for your day. In other
[52:20] words, let me break it down for you.
[52:23] Young people, older people, you're only
[52:26] really going to have deliverance from
[52:28] weaknesses inside when inside you, you
[52:31] make a genuine commitment, not a mental
[52:34] one. There's got to be a conviction
[52:38] inside that says this is the truth for
[52:41] me.
[52:43] I love the Lord with all my heart and
[52:46] this is not something is happening here.
[52:48] something inside an actual
[52:51] literal spiritual commitment to God. And
[52:54] I'm going I'm going to tell you a little
[52:56] bit more about that. So that's how you
[52:59] receive the person of the Holy Ghost and
[53:00] the necessary gifts will follow.
[53:04] Okay? You receive the person and the
[53:07] necessary gifts will follow. Amen. So
[53:10] the question was specifically about
[53:12] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[53:14] So if you have if you receive the the
[53:17] person of the Holy Ghost, what is the
[53:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost for?
[53:22] Okay. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[53:25] to give you the ability
[53:28] to do something for God in his purpose.
[53:34] The baptism is abilities,
[53:37] abilities of God.
[53:40] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is not
[53:42] abilities of man. The baptism comes with
[53:44] prophecies, tongues, interpretations,
[53:47] healings, wisdom that is beyond man,
[53:50] knowledge that is beyond man. Are you
[53:52] with me? Laying on of hands on the sick,
[53:55] those are abilities of Christ.
[53:58] They're not abilities of normal people.
[54:02] So when you receive the person and he
[54:05] gives you a gift, if he's giving you the
[54:08] gift, a gift is being given to be used.
[54:14] Are you with me? So if God has given you
[54:16] the gift of wisdom, what are you doing
[54:19] sitting at home with that wisdom?
[54:23] If God gives you the gift of prophecy,
[54:25] it's going to be used,
[54:27] when it is necessary. You don't go
[54:30] around prophesying every single day. You
[54:33] prophesy when it is necessary.
[54:35] And he'll tell you when it is necessary.
[54:37] Are you with me? That's the baptism.
[54:40] That's the gift. But you ought to have
[54:42] the person and the gifts must follow.
[54:46] Right? What is the person? You must have
[54:48] met the person. You must believe the
[54:51] person. You must believe in the person.
[54:56] And then the last stage is after that
[54:59] the person becomes you.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; All right.
[55:05] All right. Let's go on. Are you still
[55:07] with me? Yeah.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the
[55:11] ability, right? In other words, when you
[55:13] have received the person of Christ
[55:15] inside you, then the reason why I'm
[55:17] telling you this is because you know the
[55:19] quote um justification made way for the
[55:22] uh sanctification. Sanctification make
[55:24] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[55:25] The baptism of the Holy Ghost makes way
[55:27] for the person.
[55:28] But that doesn't mean you haven't met
[55:31] the person. You meet the person first.
[55:36] The last part is the person becoming
[55:38] you.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; That's what that means. You go through
[55:42] justification, sanctification, baptism
[55:44] of the Holy Ghost, then the person
[55:46] becomes you.
[55:48] &gt;&gt; But from the beginning, you have to have
[55:50] met the person.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; You have to believe the person.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; What does that mean? So in other words,
[55:58] when you've received the person of
[55:59] Christ, you then are going to need a
[56:02] particular ability to do the purpose
[56:04] that you are being called for. Right?
[56:07] When the time comes, you do that
[56:09] purpose. You to do that purpose, you
[56:11] receive the ability. This ability does
[56:13] not have to be 24/7. No one's asking if
[56:16] God has given you the spirit of wisdom.
[56:18] You're not going to be walking around
[56:19] there like Socrates and Aristotle
[56:21] proclaiming wisdom to the world every
[56:23] second of the day, you know, and like
[56:25] your friend at work comes and asks you,
[56:27] "How are you doing today? Did you know?"
[56:33] No,
[56:34] just hey, you know, today was a bad day.
[56:36] Somebody bumped my car. That's normal. I
[56:39] lost my cool a little bit. But and later
[56:43] share some wisdom. If you are moved by
[56:46] the Holy Ghost to affect the person so
[56:48] that they can recognize the spirit of
[56:50] Christ, not you.
[56:53] That's the other thing. The gift that
[56:55] you that God gives you must be given so
[56:58] that the other person glorifies God, not
[57:00] you.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; If I'm going to walk around in this
[57:04] world and people are going to say, "Hey,
[57:06] you know, Brother Alistister, he's such
[57:07] a great guy. He's such a good person.
[57:10] I'm so glad that people don't like me.
[57:13] I'm so grateful for that and they give
[57:15] glory to the word cuz then I know I'm
[57:17] doing it right.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; I'm so grateful for that. But when you
[57:23] use the gospel God has given you to
[57:25] elevate yourself, you are using the gift
[57:27] of God wrongly.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; It when people feel or recognize or or
[57:34] witness the gift God has given you, they
[57:37] must glorify God. They must glorify
[57:39] Christ. It's not about you.
[57:43] Are you with me?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; So this ability doesn't have to be a
[57:47] 24/7 anointing that sisters please stop
[57:51] prophesying to your husbands
[57:53] is tiresome. Okay? And overcorrecting
[57:57] everything or brothers stop prophesying
[57:59] over your children. You don't need to be
[58:02] doing that just simply because God gave
[58:04] you a gift.
[58:06] This ability comes according to God's
[58:09] will when it is time to act. Are you
[58:12] with me? You don't have to force the
[58:15] gift or or or push the gift or act it
[58:19] out like your life depends on it. No,
[58:22] you don't have to do that. You just have
[58:24] to keep communing with the person and
[58:28] let him lead you. Are you with me?
[58:30] Because sons of God are led by the
[58:33] spirit of God. Okay, let's go to
[58:35] question two.
[58:37] Question two is if the answer is yes,
[58:39] yes, you have to live a sanctified life,
[58:42] then how long should we live in a
[58:44] sanctified state before we could receive
[58:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost? You know,
[58:49] this is a question I've received so
[58:51] often like, "Brother Al, how long must I
[58:54] live a holy life before he gives me the
[58:56] Holy Ghost? How long must I in other
[58:59] words to me when I look at a teenager
[59:00] who's asking me that question and I feel
[59:02] so much compassion because I know
[59:04] they're trying right and and I and it's
[59:07] like how long must I be good before he
[59:09] does it for me. I'm doing my best. I'm
[59:11] trying to but I'm I'm waiting for and I
[59:14] know if I if if he gives it to me then
[59:16] my my my problems are are answered and
[59:19] I'm waiting for it and I'm looking at
[59:21] this child. I just want to hug them, you
[59:23] know, like, oh, you poor thing. You
[59:26] don't know. Even after you get the Holy
[59:28] Ghost, you're in trouble.
[59:31] It's not going to end here. Whoever told
[59:32] you this, the prophet literally said,
[59:34] once you get the Holy Ghost, every gun
[59:37] of the enemy is trained on you. He said,
[59:39] if you think you've been in a war, wait
[59:41] till you get the Holy Ghost.
[59:45] That's when the battle really begins. So
[59:47] the first thing to understand again is
[59:50] what it means to be sanctified. I gave
[59:52] you some definitions of a holy life. But
[59:55] I want to break a little bit more into
[59:57] it. Right? Sanctified. Sancti from the
[1:00:01] Latin means saint
[1:00:04] or holy.
[1:00:06] Right? Again we broke it down a few
[1:00:09] weeks ago. What is sanctified? It's the
[1:00:12] same as consecrated. It means to be set
[1:00:16] apart for the service of God.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Right? So the Lord Jesus said um or let
[1:00:24] me give you some examples. If you really
[1:00:25] understand sanctification, it's really
[1:00:27] strange. It's very strange. The Bible
[1:00:30] said the tabernacle is sanctified by the
[1:00:34] glory of God. What does that mean?
[1:00:37] Right? You'll think if you think if you
[1:00:39] have a limited idea of sanctification
[1:00:41] that it's holy, that it's clean, that
[1:00:43] it's perfect, you know, uh uh that's to
[1:00:47] me that's so beautiful. It's like you
[1:00:50] don't have to go through the the the
[1:00:52] sanctuary like Moses and them didn't
[1:00:54] have to go through the tabernacle and
[1:00:56] clean it with J
[1:01:00] to make it clean.
[1:01:03] You can scrub it. You can use
[1:01:05] detergents. I realize maybe there's some
[1:01:08] people who don't know what jig is like
[1:01:10] bleach or soap and water and
[1:01:13] disinfectant and clean it to the point
[1:01:16] you know when I was in primary school I
[1:01:18] remember our primary school teachers
[1:01:20] cleanliness is next to godliness some of
[1:01:23] them cleanliness is godliness you filthy
[1:01:26] pigs
[1:01:28] you come in here outside from the
[1:01:30] grounds and you come in here smelling
[1:01:32] and all of this and your shirt just
[1:01:34] hanging on and look at this work don't
[1:01:35] you know cleanliness is close to
[1:01:37] godliness. We've been we've been taught
[1:01:39] that by non-Christian teachers from the
[1:01:41] time we were kids in South African
[1:01:43] schools. Who here has never heard that?
[1:01:48] You're lucky
[1:01:50] if you haven't. But I can see everyone
[1:01:52] has heard that cleanliness is close to
[1:01:54] godliness. Okay. When you hear something
[1:01:57] like the Bible says the tabernacle is
[1:02:00] sanctified by the glory of God, that's
[1:02:03] telling you there's nothing you can do
[1:02:06] to make the tabernacle of the Lord more
[1:02:10] holy.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Because you can clean it up, you can
[1:02:14] shine it, you can set it straight, you
[1:02:16] can put three crosses, you can put a
[1:02:18] million crosses. It's nothing if the
[1:02:21] glory of God is not there.
[1:02:24] See, that's what it actually means. The
[1:02:27] Lord Jesus said, remember when he was
[1:02:29] fighting with the people, when I say
[1:02:30] fighting, I mean arguing with them. He
[1:02:32] said to them, the temple, he says, uh,
[1:02:36] does doesn't the temple sanctify the
[1:02:38] gold that is in the temple?
[1:02:41] Which is greater then, the gold or the
[1:02:43] temple?
[1:02:44] I love it. Right? Paul says the
[1:02:48] believing, listen to this. If you think
[1:02:49] sanctified means a a holy life, why does
[1:02:52] Paul says the believing wife sanctifies
[1:02:55] the unbelieving husband?
[1:02:59] If sanctification has got to do with
[1:03:01] living a holy life before God, how does
[1:03:04] the believing wife sanctify the
[1:03:06] unbelieving husband? He's unbelieving.
[1:03:10] How is he sanctified?
[1:03:13] If he's unbelieving, how is he
[1:03:14] sanctified? By a believing woman. How
[1:03:17] does the unbelieving hus the believing
[1:03:19] husband sanctify the unbelieving wife?
[1:03:22] She's unbelieving. How is she then
[1:03:25] sanctified?
[1:03:26] Because she or he agrees to live the
[1:03:30] lifestyle she wants to live. They become
[1:03:33] sanctified. Why? They are living in the
[1:03:36] purpose of God.
[1:03:38] That's what makes them sanctified even
[1:03:41] though he's unbelieving.
[1:03:44] So what is sanctification got to do with
[1:03:46] the purpose of God?
[1:03:50] You see?
[1:03:52] Yeah.
[1:03:54] Um there's another scripture that says
[1:03:57] um sanctify your food that you eat with
[1:04:01] or the the food that you eat is
[1:04:02] sanctified with prayer and by the word
[1:04:05] of God. What does that mean? If you have
[1:04:07] a nice slice of steak or pork and pray
[1:04:11] over it, then it becomes holy. Like what
[1:04:14] is the the steak worshiping God?
[1:04:19] Like what is a steak have a halo over
[1:04:21] it?
[1:04:23] What do you mean sanctify? Was it dirty
[1:04:26] before? Is it now made clean? No.
[1:04:30] Sanctify is made useful to me.
[1:04:35] But another person is eating the steak.
[1:04:37] Is it not useful to them? No. That food
[1:04:40] that I'm eating when I pray with the
[1:04:42] Holy Ghost and praying for the food of
[1:04:44] Lord, let this give me the strength to
[1:04:47] continue another day to live for you.
[1:04:49] The food becomes sanctified
[1:04:52] because it's actually keeping this
[1:04:54] temple of God alive to do the purpose of
[1:04:57] God. That's the only reason that that
[1:04:59] food does not have a holy atmosphere
[1:05:01] around it.
[1:05:03] that food is not living the life.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I hear people I remember uh
[1:05:12] growing up,
[1:05:14] you know, hearing people pray for the
[1:05:15] food. Lord, I sanctify this food in the
[1:05:17] name of Jesus.
[1:05:22] Bless their hearts. You know, they mean
[1:05:24] the best except they just don't know
[1:05:27] what they're saying.
[1:05:29] It means something if you if you know
[1:05:32] what you're saying. When you're serving
[1:05:34] God, you know what you're doing. You
[1:05:36] you're really have a a then your faith
[1:05:40] is real,
[1:05:41] right? When you pray over food, you're
[1:05:45] praying that it must be beneficial to
[1:05:47] you so that you are continuing your walk
[1:05:50] with God. For a person to be conscious
[1:05:53] of that is is good. It's important.
[1:05:57] And uh to you here today, it means
[1:06:00] nothing. All of you pray for your food
[1:06:02] just because you were taught that if you
[1:06:04] don't pray for your food, it's bad for
[1:06:05] you and you're a bad Christian.
[1:06:09] You know that.
[1:06:11] Yeah. Let's all pray. Let's all hold
[1:06:13] hands. Let's all pray because that's
[1:06:14] what good Christians do. Let's pray for
[1:06:16] our food. Father, for what we about to
[1:06:18] receive, make us truly thankful. Amen.
[1:06:21] Right. Our Lord, thank you for the food.
[1:06:24] Blessed to our bodies. Amen. Why?
[1:06:26] Because it's a thing we do. Are you
[1:06:29] really sanctifying your food with that
[1:06:31] prayer?
[1:06:33] No. You know why? You don't feel it?
[1:06:35] Because you have food in abundance. You
[1:06:38] have breakfast and you can choose what
[1:06:40] you want for breakfast. You have lunch.
[1:06:42] You can choose what you want for lunch.
[1:06:43] Dinner. Imagine if you're living in the
[1:06:45] day of Paul and you're barely getting
[1:06:48] food. And the food you're about to eat
[1:06:51] is not even with preservatives. It could
[1:06:54] have bacteria. It could have poisoned.
[1:06:58] What you're about to drink could have
[1:06:59] hurt you. If you sanctify it to God,
[1:07:02] you're asking God with with pure uh uh
[1:07:06] urgency, Lord, I've got work to do for
[1:07:10] you. Bless this food to my body so that
[1:07:12] I might continue to do your work. There
[1:07:15] are people who are actually sanctifying
[1:07:17] their food. You don't really do that.
[1:07:21] You don't really do that.
[1:07:23] Today it it is literally a tradition in
[1:07:25] Christianity to pray for your food.
[1:07:30] You don't care if it makes you sick.
[1:07:31] You'll just take medicine.
[1:07:33] Paul and those guys did not have
[1:07:35] medicine.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; You get sick with food. Probiotics
[1:07:40] or you know what? Buscoan for stomach
[1:07:43] cramps. You don't even care about
[1:07:45] sanctifying the food. Nobody does today.
[1:07:48] If you tell me you are, you're lying to
[1:07:49] me. And I know you're lying.
[1:07:52] Nobody does that because food is not a
[1:07:54] rare commodity to you anymore. It's so
[1:07:57] it's praying for food has become a
[1:07:59] tradition till sometimes I can't tell
[1:08:02] you how it annoys me
[1:08:05] when I just I hear the traditions annoy
[1:08:07] me every the more and more I live in
[1:08:10] this life traditions are annoying me cuz
[1:08:12] that I know they make the word of God of
[1:08:13] non effect cuz I know what it means.
[1:08:17] You know when uh you get to a place and
[1:08:19] you're eating something and you're going
[1:08:20] to preach and you know this stuff is not
[1:08:22] even cooked right? That's when you're
[1:08:24] going to sanctify your food. Trust me.
[1:08:27] Yeah. You can see it's not cooked right.
[1:08:30] You can see there's a cockroach leg in
[1:08:32] your food.
[1:08:35] Yeah. I've eaten those things.
[1:08:41] That's when you sanctify your food.
[1:08:43] Lord, I have got five days to preach
[1:08:45] here.
[1:08:46] I don't have all the probiotics in the
[1:08:48] world or the greatest bathrooms and
[1:08:51] conditions. I need strength. Sanctify
[1:08:54] this food for me.
[1:08:58] That's when you do it. Not when you go
[1:09:00] to your cupboard and look at
[1:09:04] what weedpics
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; or pro neutral or
[1:09:12] otis. Lord, sanctify this food. Come on.
[1:09:17] You don't know what you're doing.
[1:09:20] Okay.
[1:09:23] So, it means to be set apart. Are you
[1:09:25] with me? For the purpose of God. If you
[1:09:28] really understand sanctification, it is
[1:09:30] strange. The prophet says in mostly
[1:09:34] throughout the message, we are
[1:09:36] sanctified by the blood of Christ.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; All right. So, how many of you have a
[1:09:42] cup of the blood of Christ hanging
[1:09:43] around?
[1:09:45] where you sanctify everything with a
[1:09:46] drop of Christ's blood which nobody has.
[1:09:49] So how are you sanctified with the blood
[1:09:51] of Christ, right? The problem is it is
[1:09:55] always taught as a spiritual experience
[1:09:57] which nobody can attain because it it's
[1:10:00] like you got to be this super holy
[1:10:02] person to have this blood of Christ that
[1:10:04] sanctifies you. Right? People in the
[1:10:07] past experienced sanctification without
[1:10:10] knowing it. So then when they came to
[1:10:12] teach it, they taught it all wrong.
[1:10:15] Right? And they taught it uh according
[1:10:17] to their experience and they taught it
[1:10:20] in a way that it cost out because if you
[1:10:22] don't have the same experience they have
[1:10:23] then it's like you're measuring yourself
[1:10:25] and I don't have it.
[1:10:28] They didn't mean to. Right? So let's
[1:10:30] look at the truth. Saints, are you still
[1:10:32] with me?
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Sanctification. See, I always call you
[1:10:36] saints cuz I believe you're sanctified.
[1:10:39] Sanctification has two parts when you
[1:10:42] break it down. Firstly, young people,
[1:10:46] the first part of sanctification is you
[1:10:49] sanctifying yourself.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; This is why this is what is necessary.
[1:10:55] You must sanctify yourself. And that's
[1:10:58] the part where you got to understand how
[1:10:59] do I do that, right? So, first you
[1:11:02] sanctify yourself by consecrating
[1:11:05] yourself to the word.
[1:11:08] What does that mean? So for example,
[1:11:12] when a priest said or when when God said
[1:11:15] to Aaron, you are holy unto me. In other
[1:11:19] words, you are consecrated unto me. Let
[1:11:21] me break that down for you. Aaron,
[1:11:24] you're a priest to work in this
[1:11:25] tabernacle. You are a priest to my law,
[1:11:29] to my altar, to my seven golden
[1:11:31] candlesticks, to my table of shoebread,
[1:11:34] to my altar of incense, to my ark of the
[1:11:36] covenant. You are holy unto that. What
[1:11:39] does that mean? You cannot go to some
[1:11:41] other tabernacle.
[1:11:43] You cannot sacrifice on another altar.
[1:11:46] You are holy to this one. You get it?
[1:11:50] It's not saying Aaron is this perfect
[1:11:52] guy who doesn't lose his temper.
[1:11:54] It's saying he's holy unto this
[1:11:56] tabernacle.
[1:11:58] Like so for let's say let's say for
[1:11:59] example you're a talented musician.
[1:12:03] How is your gift consecrated to God?
[1:12:06] That means I am not going to use my gift
[1:12:09] to play worldly music.
[1:12:12] I am not going to use my gift. You
[1:12:14] listen, you can do what you want to. You
[1:12:17] can play music in church. You can play
[1:12:20] music at home. You can listen to stuff.
[1:12:23] You can play worldly songs. You can play
[1:12:25] the national anthem. You can play uh
[1:12:28] stuff in your school.
[1:12:31] Whatever you're doing, I'm not saying
[1:12:33] you must do that. I'm saying but when
[1:12:34] you are consecrated
[1:12:37] you are saying to God my gift is only
[1:12:40] for you
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; that's consecrated that's holiness and
[1:12:46] when you do that let me tell you
[1:12:48] something watch the atmosphere then
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; it's unmistakable
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; you are a singer great singer you can
[1:12:58] sing songs of worship but when your gift
[1:13:01] of singing is consecrated you are
[1:13:03] saying, "I will not sing any other song
[1:13:06] but that which glorifies God."
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; That is consecrated. That is holy.
[1:13:12] That's not hard to do.
[1:13:15] That's a thing you can do. It's like
[1:13:18] this. If I'm a pastor to this church and
[1:13:22] now I'm holy unto God in the ministry
[1:13:26] and then I go take the gift God gives me
[1:13:29] to go preach to other people or to go
[1:13:32] use it to uh do stuff for other people
[1:13:36] who are not even a part of God's fold
[1:13:38] and use it for my own gain to gain fame
[1:13:42] and monetary value. I am not being
[1:13:44] consecrated.
[1:13:46] I'm using the gift God gave me to speak
[1:13:49] the word to go and work in politics or
[1:13:52] in in in government or in some business
[1:13:55] or something. A pastor needs to be
[1:13:57] consecrated to the sheep.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; That is holiness.
[1:14:03] You see the difference? I still have a
[1:14:06] weird character.
[1:14:08] I still have faults, but I'm committed
[1:14:11] to the faith of God by the revealed word
[1:14:15] for this day. That's what it means young
[1:14:18] people to be consecrated. So for you as
[1:14:21] a young person, fine, you're not a
[1:14:23] pastor. Maybe you're not a musician,
[1:14:25] maybe you don't have something to to to
[1:14:27] do in the church. So you don't have some
[1:14:29] kind of purpose that you can say I'm
[1:14:31] consecrated. Every single one of us
[1:14:33] needs to be consecrated in one thing.
[1:14:37] The word of God comes first before any
[1:14:40] other philosophy of life,
[1:14:43] before my education.
[1:14:46] So if you go to university and you come
[1:14:49] to me and tell me, I don't believe what
[1:14:51] brother Ben Barnham said here because
[1:14:53] this is what we learned in science right
[1:14:55] there, you're not consecrated
[1:14:58] because you're already dividing your
[1:15:00] heart on belief.
[1:15:04] To be consecrated to God's word means to
[1:15:06] be undivided.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; That means to me the Bible and the
[1:15:12] message is my standard.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Nothing comes and one day when I get
[1:15:18] married, it's still going to be my
[1:15:20] standard.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; When I'm in business, it's still going
[1:15:23] to be my standard. When I'm in school,
[1:15:25] it's still going to be my standard. It's
[1:15:27] what I believe in no matter where I go.
[1:15:30] I mean listen, we have brother John here
[1:15:33] who is a medical doctor. He learned
[1:15:35] about evolution.
[1:15:37] He learned about they would have told
[1:15:38] him in school that uh the world started
[1:15:42] so many billion years ago the earth and
[1:15:44] and he learned about evolution. He
[1:15:47] learned about genetics. He's not here
[1:15:48] sitting here denying God though he's a
[1:15:51] medical doctor working in it.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; He learned the things you are learning
[1:15:55] but there isn't an ounce of doubt in his
[1:15:57] mind about who God is.
[1:16:00] Amen.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; You have brothers who work in
[1:16:03] engineering science or something and
[1:16:05] they learn stuff in engineering and you
[1:16:06] learn about this. You learn about
[1:16:07] materials that are supposed to be so
[1:16:09] many million years ago. They're not
[1:16:11] coming to me saying, "Brother L, what
[1:16:13] about this so many million years ago?"
[1:16:15] No. The Bible is wrong. No. So this
[1:16:18] young people, if you come to a point in
[1:16:20] your life where your heart is telling
[1:16:22] you that
[1:16:25] I don't know, you're siding with
[1:16:26] something in politics,
[1:16:29] this is why when when I talk about
[1:16:31] things like abortion, climate change,
[1:16:33] all of this stuff, why am I telling you
[1:16:35] this? I'm not interested in politics. My
[1:16:38] heart is not divided.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; You're not going to shift me because I
[1:16:43] know what God's word says.
[1:16:45] I got no issue with people talking about
[1:16:47] climate change. Just don't tell me it's
[1:16:48] going to destroy the world cuz I know
[1:16:50] what's going to destroy the world. And
[1:16:51] the Bible tells me and it's not climate
[1:16:53] change
[1:16:55] because I believe every prophecy of the
[1:16:57] book of Revelation, which is why I don't
[1:16:59] I don't subscribe to the lies the
[1:17:01] politics is telling me. They can tell me
[1:17:03] all they want to. I must not drive this
[1:17:06] car so much. Must not take planes. I
[1:17:08] must not. But they're lying to us. There
[1:17:10] is no way they're going to get solar
[1:17:11] powered ships
[1:17:13] to bring our containers. They are never
[1:17:16] going to get rid of oil. We do not have
[1:17:17] anything. We don't have solar powered
[1:17:20] planes yet. They're never going to be
[1:17:22] able to make it.
[1:17:26] Can you imagine solar powered planes
[1:17:28] flying across the Atlantic and then nose
[1:17:31] diving because it died?
[1:17:35] Okay. Or how about the ships that bring
[1:17:38] the thousands of containers for all our
[1:17:41] food from other lands and our devices?
[1:17:44] Is there any sort of material today that
[1:17:46] they can use beside oil? No. So they're
[1:17:51] lying to you.
[1:17:53] It's politics. Don't subscribe to it.
[1:17:57] Why? Because you are holy unto the Lord.
[1:18:00] Your philosophy, your belief, your ideas
[1:18:04] are all guided by his thoughts, that's
[1:18:08] consecrated.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Even if I don't understand it, I'm
[1:18:14] consecrated.
[1:18:15] What he says is the most important to
[1:18:18] me. When you recognize that, you have a
[1:18:21] life that is ready to be changed. when
[1:18:24] you're still divided on what where the
[1:18:27] word of God is on whether the word of
[1:18:30] God so so if you if you know the word of
[1:18:32] God you are consecrated to the word of
[1:18:34] God will you listen to what your friends
[1:18:36] tell you
[1:18:38] it consecration gives you such a
[1:18:40] strength your friends can tell you hey
[1:18:42] listen let's go to club today let's go
[1:18:44] let's go try to smoke and you are
[1:18:46] consecrated you don't even need the Holy
[1:18:48] Ghost yet you'll say no I'm sorry I
[1:18:51] can't do that I won't do that I won't do
[1:18:55] that.
[1:18:59] Why? Why won't you do it? I don't
[1:19:02] believe I should do that.
[1:19:04] Can you hear what I'm saying? I don't
[1:19:06] believe I should do that. Why? Oh, your
[1:19:09] mommy is ruling you. No, it's not my
[1:19:12] mommy. It's not my daddy. It's not my
[1:19:14] church. I am consecrated to the word.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; I know what the word of God says. I
[1:19:20] believe when you are consecrated, you
[1:19:22] know, one day I'm going to be used of
[1:19:25] God. You don't even have the Holy Ghost,
[1:19:28] but in your mind, in your heart, you
[1:19:30] know, one day I'm going to be used of
[1:19:32] God. I want to keep myself for that.
[1:19:35] That's consecration. Amen.
[1:19:38] Justification.
[1:19:40] Uh, all right. Sorry, I was talking
[1:19:42] about the two parts. So, when you
[1:19:44] consecrate yourself, right? And we're
[1:19:47] going to talk a little bit more about
[1:19:48] that. The second part is God consecrates
[1:19:51] you for his purpose by drawing you
[1:19:54] deeper into the word for your day. So
[1:19:57] the first part is you consecrating
[1:19:59] yourself and then he consecrates you.
[1:20:02] Like for example, when God created the
[1:20:04] when God told the um the um priests and
[1:20:10] he you remember that perfume of the
[1:20:11] apothecary,
[1:20:13] remember that that perfume that they put
[1:20:15] upon the coals of the altar and produces
[1:20:17] the smell, the scent, the smoke. He said
[1:20:20] that perfume is holy unto me.
[1:20:24] What did that mean? that perfume is not
[1:20:27] allowed to be used for anything else but
[1:20:30] the altar of incense. In other words,
[1:20:33] Aaron, don't sneaky put it on you for a
[1:20:36] perfume for when you go to the wedding
[1:20:39] because it smells nice. It is holy unto
[1:20:43] this altar.
[1:20:45] &gt;&gt; It's only for that. That's holiness.
[1:20:48] That's sanctification. That's
[1:20:50] consecration.
[1:20:52] That's the truth of it. So I'm saying
[1:20:54] young people, can you live your life as
[1:20:57] if the word of God is the only guiding
[1:21:01] force of your mind?
[1:21:05] That your belief, that your faith is
[1:21:07] undivided,
[1:21:09] that you're not going to believe what
[1:21:10] Hollywood tells you. That when Hollywood
[1:21:12] tells you something, your heart says,
[1:21:14] "No, I don't believe that." When
[1:21:17] politics says something, "No, I don't
[1:21:19] believe that." Because God's word says
[1:21:21] this,
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; that's sanctification,
[1:21:25] right?
[1:21:26] All right.
[1:21:28] My screen switched off on me.
[1:21:32] Okay.
[1:21:33] So, two parts to it, right? You sanctify
[1:21:36] yourself and he sanctifies you for his
[1:21:38] purpose. Are you still with me?
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; Justification is the gift of faith that
[1:21:42] gives you that God gives you when you
[1:21:44] first believe. That's when you start
[1:21:46] self self-examining and seeking to come
[1:21:48] into the fold. How does time fly like
[1:21:51] that?
[1:21:53] When you are drawn into sanctification,
[1:21:55] you are not self-examining uh anymore.
[1:21:59] Are you with me?
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; You are examining the body of Christ.
[1:22:03] Are you listening?
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Why are you examining the body of
[1:22:06] Christ? Because when you're a person who
[1:22:08] reaches sanctification, you are seeing
[1:22:10] yourself as part of his body,
[1:22:14] right? You are so it means you are
[1:22:16] looking outside of yourself to be used
[1:22:20] of the purpose for the purpose of the
[1:22:21] church right first you you sanctify
[1:22:25] yourself by keeping yourself for the
[1:22:26] word so let me explain it this way
[1:22:29] because I know young people will
[1:22:31] definitely understand it this way right
[1:22:33] when you are growing up you're 13 years
[1:22:36] old you're 14 years old let's let's take
[1:22:39] a boy you go to school there's a whole
[1:22:42] lot of pretty girls out there right
[1:22:43] boys. Yes. Yeah. Lots of pretty girls
[1:22:46] out there. Okay. And u you look at all
[1:22:50] of them and you say, "Oh, she's pretty.
[1:22:52] Oh, she's pretty. She's cute. She's Same
[1:22:54] with the young girls. That boy is cute.
[1:22:56] Whatever. Whatever." Right? You feel a
[1:22:58] little flutter inside. You feel
[1:23:00] attracted to them. You act stupid like
[1:23:01] you can walk on the wall. Look at me.
[1:23:03] Look at me. How great I am. Right? And
[1:23:05] hopefully she's noticed in the meantime,
[1:23:07] what a fool walking on the wall. He
[1:23:08] might hurt himself, but you feeling
[1:23:10] great. See, you're like, "I can do this.
[1:23:14] I hope she's watching me. She's watching
[1:23:17] you thinking you're a fool. You'll break
[1:23:18] your leg. Get off there." But you don't
[1:23:20] know. You don't care because you know,
[1:23:23] read Tom Sawyer. A lot of you.
[1:23:28] But then when you're in love with a
[1:23:31] girl, you come to the point where you've
[1:23:33] zoned in on this girl and she is the one
[1:23:36] for you. Okay, young children, if you're
[1:23:39] from 13 to 18 and you're in school,
[1:23:41] there's no such thing. There is no one
[1:23:43] for you.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Okay, your studies is number one.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Finish your studies, get a job, and then
[1:23:50] go there. If you're in school, you're
[1:23:51] not ready to be married. Stop it.
[1:23:56] That's Uncle Al's advice.
[1:24:00] Okay, obviously I can't stop you if you
[1:24:03] if you're feeling attracted to somebody,
[1:24:06] but if you're in love with a girl, okay,
[1:24:10] and now watch this. You're in love with
[1:24:13] a girl. You're over 18. You're ready to
[1:24:16] become you're a a man who has a job and
[1:24:20] starts a h a family. Now, are you all
[1:24:23] listening?
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; So, you're in love with a girl, but she
[1:24:26] lives in her house. You live in yours
[1:24:30] because of your love for her. You commit
[1:24:33] yourself to her within yourself
[1:24:39] without telling her you love her. You
[1:24:41] already made it in your heart that you
[1:24:43] are committed to her. You are
[1:24:45] sanctifying yourself to her.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; You made a promise to yourself you will
[1:24:50] not look at another girl because your
[1:24:53] heart is sanctified to her.
[1:24:56] She doesn't even know you love her, but
[1:24:58] you already zoned in and sanctified.
[1:25:02] That means another drop dead gorgeous
[1:25:04] girl can stand in front of you and
[1:25:06] you're not even looking at her because
[1:25:07] you've been totally committed to someone
[1:25:09] else in your heart. Are you with me?
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; And drop dead gorgeous.
[1:25:17] Please just let them open their mouth
[1:25:22] and watch all the dumbness pour out then
[1:25:25] you know.
[1:25:27] Okay.
[1:25:29] You only hear that from me. So
[1:25:31] appreciate it and take it right now.
[1:25:34] Okay. So because of your love for her,
[1:25:37] you commit yourself to her within
[1:25:39] yourself without even a promise of
[1:25:41] marriage. Right? You commit yourself to
[1:25:43] be only for her. That is sanctification.
[1:25:49] You and then what does sanctification do
[1:25:51] for you? If you're only committed to
[1:25:53] her, she lives in her house, you live in
[1:25:54] your house. Uh you you if you are
[1:25:57] committed to her, what's going to happen
[1:25:59] is something takes over you. You're
[1:26:01] going to start living in her orbit.
[1:26:04] You're going to start conducting your
[1:26:06] life where you meet her. You're going to
[1:26:07] take the same bus and take the same
[1:26:09] train. You're going to visit. You're
[1:26:11] going to be around there. You're going
[1:26:12] to be living in an orbit because that's
[1:26:14] what sanctification does. When you're
[1:26:16] committed to someone, you're going to
[1:26:17] live in their orbit.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? You're going to try to
[1:26:21] be as close to her as possible. You're
[1:26:23] going to call her. You're going to write
[1:26:24] to her. You're going to visit her.
[1:26:26] You're going to dress for her. You're
[1:26:29] going to buy her gifts. You're going to
[1:26:30] praise her when you meet her. You're
[1:26:32] going to feel obligated to say, "You
[1:26:34] look nice today." And she thinks, "I
[1:26:36] look like a wreck. What is he even
[1:26:37] saying?"
[1:26:39] You don't care. You're committed to her.
[1:26:41] So, you're going to praise her. You're
[1:26:44] going to show her you're thinking about
[1:26:45] her. That's sanctification.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; See, I know you understand that now.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Now apply that to God. When you are in
[1:26:55] love with God and you are in love with
[1:26:57] the word, you are going to live in his
[1:26:59] orbit.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; You are going to get close to him. In
[1:27:03] bad times, you will praise him.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; See, you're going to dress for him.
[1:27:08] You're going to bring gifts.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; You're going to praise him. You're going
[1:27:12] to help out. If there if help is needed,
[1:27:14] that's sanctification.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; You can't tell me, brother Al, you know,
[1:27:19] I'm I really want the Holy Ghost, but
[1:27:21] you don't come to church.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; You don't dress like you like you like
[1:27:25] you believe in God. You don't talk like
[1:27:27] you believe in God. You talk like your
[1:27:29] friends. How is that sanctification?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; That's something you can change without
[1:27:33] the Holy Ghost.
[1:27:38] If you're sanctified to her, you won't
[1:27:41] be putting yourself in the orbit of
[1:27:43] other girls.
[1:27:45] You haven't even told her you love her
[1:27:46] yet. You love her in your heart, and
[1:27:49] you're waiting for the chance to tell
[1:27:51] her. But what are you doing? You're
[1:27:54] putting yourself in her orbit, in her in
[1:27:56] her vicinity, in her proximity.
[1:28:01] See, and you find yourself, if you find
[1:28:04] yourself in the presence of other girls,
[1:28:06] you are still going to keep yourself
[1:28:08] because you are sanctified to her. A
[1:28:10] girl come up to you, she'll flirt with
[1:28:12] you, you'll just brush it off. Because
[1:28:15] in your heart, you are sanctified to
[1:28:17] somebody else. Do we understand?
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; That's it. That's how simple it is. And
[1:28:24] that doesn't need the Holy Ghost.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] This needs true repentance.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; True repentance is what it takes by true
[1:28:34] recognition of the gospel for c of
[1:28:36] Christ for your day. In other words, you
[1:28:38] have to come to a point in your life,
[1:28:40] young people, where you see the Lord is
[1:28:43] amazing. His word is amazing.
[1:28:47] Like there's nothing else but this for
[1:28:50] me. This is this is phenomenal. This is
[1:28:54] like better than a juicy steak. This is
[1:28:58] you can't even describe it. The the the
[1:29:00] word is amazing. The the the prophet of
[1:29:03] God who brought this message is
[1:29:04] phenomenal. The Bible, I love to read
[1:29:06] it. I'm committed to it. That's
[1:29:08] sanctification.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; You can be that way without even having
[1:29:12] the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; The gifts.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; You can be that way. You can love to
[1:29:19] come to church. You could love to read
[1:29:21] your Bible. To wake up in the morning to
[1:29:24] read your Bible first before you even
[1:29:26] brush your teeth.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, what do you have for me today?
[1:29:32] Just one thought today. Oh, can't wait.
[1:29:37] See, no. What do we do today? Pick up
[1:29:41] the cell phone. What's the first thing
[1:29:42] on TikTok? You're not sanctified.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; You're not committed.
[1:29:48] See? So I'm saying you want results but
[1:29:54] you're not willing to put anything in.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; There's no time limit to sanctification
[1:30:02] especially today. So the person was
[1:30:04] saying how long do we have to live
[1:30:05] sanctified before we receive the baptism
[1:30:08] of the Holy Ghost? Sanctification never
[1:30:11] stops because after you're married
[1:30:14] you're still sanctified to her.
[1:30:16] Are you with me? Amen.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; There's no time limit. After you're
[1:30:20] married, you're even more committed to
[1:30:22] her.
[1:30:24] Same thing to God. After you receive the
[1:30:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost, you're even
[1:30:27] more committed to him.
[1:30:31] We are not living in a day like after
[1:30:33] the book of Acts. There was no need for
[1:30:35] spreading of the gospel at breakneck
[1:30:37] speed. Today, we're not living in a day
[1:30:39] where the world has so many different
[1:30:40] languages and we can't speak each
[1:30:42] other's language. Everyone speaks
[1:30:44] English now. And now we have Google
[1:30:45] Translate. And now we have
[1:30:47] interpretations and we can actually get
[1:30:49] this message out by without even leaving
[1:30:51] our house.
[1:30:53] Just put it on the internet.
[1:30:56] We're not living in a day with why am I
[1:30:58] saying this? Cuz you don't need those
[1:31:00] gifts anymore to go and speak with
[1:31:02] tongues with in another person's tongue
[1:31:04] and someone else to interpret to
[1:31:06] vindicate the word. You don't even need
[1:31:07] that anymore because the whole world is
[1:31:10] speaking English. And even if they
[1:31:12] don't, they speak a language we kind of
[1:31:14] know and we can get someone to help out.
[1:31:18] In terms of time, you should always live
[1:31:20] a righteous life irrespective. Listen
[1:31:24] people,
[1:31:26] I I I say it this way. You know, we we
[1:31:30] taught our kids uh I can tell you this.
[1:31:34] When we taught our kids about living
[1:31:36] right, we didn't even use the prophet.
[1:31:40] For many years in our life, our boys
[1:31:42] didn't even know who the prophet is
[1:31:45] because we didn't teach them holiness
[1:31:46] comes from that man.
[1:31:49] We didn't teach them that to live a
[1:31:51] righteous life, you need to have the
[1:31:53] Bible.
[1:31:55] Our kids knew what is righteous because
[1:31:58] this is how we lived.
[1:32:00] This is what we believe in this is house
[1:32:02] in this house. This is what we do. This
[1:32:04] is what we when we taught them about
[1:32:07] smoking, we taught them how disgusting
[1:32:09] it is, how stupid it is.
[1:32:13] We would ask them things like if you if
[1:32:16] you're going to take alcohol, why would
[1:32:17] you want to take something that will
[1:32:19] make you rip off your clothes and run
[1:32:21] around naked
[1:32:22] and then regret it the day after? Like,
[1:32:25] why would you do that? What? What's
[1:32:27] wrong with you? We taught it that way
[1:32:29] before it came to a point of the word
[1:32:32] and God and holiness and that kind. So
[1:32:35] our our kids grew up understanding you
[1:32:38] can be a better person like if you swear
[1:32:41] you're someone who has bad vocabulary.
[1:32:43] You can't express yourself in English.
[1:32:44] Therefore you need swear words
[1:32:47] learn better English. That's what we
[1:32:49] taught them first. You don't need to
[1:32:51] speak with slang because if you speak
[1:32:53] better English you don't need slang.
[1:32:56] We taught them that first. Then it comes
[1:32:59] time to holiness to God before even get
[1:33:02] there. In other words, you can live a
[1:33:04] righteous life without even the message,
[1:33:07] without even the Bible, without even the
[1:33:08] Holy Ghost. You must learn to live a
[1:33:12] better person. Listen, why would you
[1:33:15] want to smoke? It's not even logical to
[1:33:17] smoke. Why? It's logical to not smoke,
[1:33:20] not drink, not fornicate.
[1:33:24] It's logical.
[1:33:27] First learn that it's logical.
[1:33:30] Okay.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; So in terms of time, you should always
[1:33:36] live a righteous life irrespective of
[1:33:38] receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:40] And I'm going to teach you about that.
[1:33:41] When you get water baptized, you are
[1:33:44] making a promise to the body of Christ
[1:33:48] to be a good representative of the
[1:33:51] church.
[1:33:52] It is your reasonable service. Let's
[1:33:55] read. Romans 12:1. I love the way people
[1:33:59] read this and not really know what it
[1:34:02] means. I beseech you. This is Paul. I
[1:34:04] beseech you. Listen to Paul. He's
[1:34:06] saying, I'm pleading with you. I'm
[1:34:09] asking you. I'm begging you, brethren,
[1:34:13] by the mercies of God.
[1:34:16] You see, when you read it that way, it
[1:34:17] sounds different. that you present your
[1:34:19] bodies a living sacrifice, holy,
[1:34:23] sanctified, consecrated, acceptable unto
[1:34:26] God. Why is acceptable? So that he can
[1:34:28] use you, which is your reasonable
[1:34:33] service.
[1:34:34] Logical.
[1:34:36] Reasonable means logical.
[1:34:40] In other words, if you are doing stuff
[1:34:43] where he cannot use you, it's logical.
[1:34:45] You can't be used if you are in those
[1:34:47] activities. This is your logical
[1:34:50] service. It's your reasonable service.
[1:34:52] Are you with me?
[1:34:54] &gt;&gt; A living sacrifice, holy and acceptable.
[1:34:57] This is not a conditional thing. This is
[1:35:00] um if you if you don't,
[1:35:03] this is not saying if you don't do this,
[1:35:05] you will be lost or God will refuse you.
[1:35:08] He's not saying uh if you mess up or
[1:35:11] something. He's saying basically if you
[1:35:13] if you mess around or you're not living
[1:35:15] an acceptable life, we can't use you.
[1:35:18] You're going to be a bad trumpet.
[1:35:22] If we get you to speak the word for us,
[1:35:24] you're going to be a bad ambassador. So,
[1:35:26] I'm I'm begging you do just live this
[1:35:29] way so you can you can work for us. You
[1:35:33] can work for God. You can be a good
[1:35:35] ambassador. That's what he's telling
[1:35:37] you. It's not a conditional thing. He's
[1:35:39] not saying if you don't live acceptable
[1:35:41] unto God or a living sacrifice that
[1:35:43] God's going to throw you away. He's not
[1:35:45] saying that.
[1:35:47] This is a human ministerial request from
[1:35:50] Paul telling you if you live
[1:35:51] responsibly, you'll be more valuable to
[1:35:54] the church. You'll be more usable for
[1:35:56] the purpose of God. Are you
[1:35:58] understanding? It means if you live
[1:36:00] clean, responsible, you can be called
[1:36:03] upon to serve the church. You will be
[1:36:04] respected by others and used to bring
[1:36:07] people in. You could be given
[1:36:09] responsibilities in the church. It's
[1:36:11] your reasonable logical service. So
[1:36:14] young people, presenting your bodies as
[1:36:16] a living sacrifice, a living sacrifice
[1:36:19] means, are you all listening?
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Use your free will to stay away from bad
[1:36:25] things.
[1:36:27] That's living sacrifice
[1:36:30] as opposed to a dead sacrifice.
[1:36:33] Okay?
[1:36:34] Use your free will. Your free will means
[1:36:37] I choose not to. Okay?
[1:36:42] And what is that? Bad things are what?
[1:36:44] Addictive substances, bad behavior,
[1:36:46] gluttony, covetousness, fornication, and
[1:36:49] the likes.
[1:36:52] He asked you, he's asking you to do that
[1:36:55] by your free will. He's not saying wait
[1:36:58] till you get the Holy Ghost to stop
[1:36:59] doing that. You can stop it right now.
[1:37:03] You can choose to. You can choose not to
[1:37:06] have those bad friends.
[1:37:09] Why do you want those bad friends,
[1:37:12] right? Why would you want to go and do
[1:37:14] those? You can choose to do it without
[1:37:16] the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:19] Present your bodies a living sacrifice.
[1:37:22] It's like if you're in the world and you
[1:37:25] get married, do you know how many people
[1:37:27] when they get married, uh they say,
[1:37:30] "Okay, my wife is pregnant. I need to
[1:37:32] stop smoking." And they stop smoking.
[1:37:35] what happened,
[1:37:37] right? Or uh if you're in the world and
[1:37:40] you you you uh it would if you're
[1:37:43] getting married, let's say um you're
[1:37:45] you're a university student, you've been
[1:37:47] drinking with your friends at the bar,
[1:37:49] then you meet a pretty girl and you want
[1:37:50] to get married to her. Now you say, "Oh,
[1:37:52] I got to give up my friends and my
[1:37:54] drinking friends because I'm I want to
[1:37:55] be committed to her." And then you give
[1:37:57] up drinking for her.
[1:38:02] If you have a child, you stop smoking.
[1:38:04] Why? It's advantageous. If you want to
[1:38:07] keep the pretty girl, stop drinking. So,
[1:38:09] you do it. If you want to make sure your
[1:38:12] children are healthy, don't smoke. You
[1:38:15] do it because it's advantageous.
[1:38:18] So, is it for the church, it's
[1:38:21] advantageous for us. If you live
[1:38:22] righteous, you can be used. You can be
[1:38:25] more easily and better used for God's
[1:38:27] kingdom. Right? That's what we're
[1:38:29] saying. Let's read 1 Thessalonians 4:3.
[1:38:32] Then Paul also tells us, "However,
[1:38:35] don't just do this out of religion. Do
[1:38:38] it because you have something inside, an
[1:38:42] experience inside that happened." Right?
[1:38:44] Don't just do it because you're
[1:38:46] complying with the religion. Are you
[1:38:48] with us?
[1:38:49] &gt;&gt; Okay. 1 Thessalonians 4:3. For this is
[1:38:51] the will of God, even your
[1:38:52] sanctification,
[1:38:54] that you should abstain from
[1:38:56] fornication.
[1:38:57] even your sanctification that you should
[1:38:59] abstain
[1:39:01] by free will. Stay away from illegal
[1:39:05] sexuality.
[1:39:08] That every one of you should know how to
[1:39:11] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[1:39:14] honor, not in the lust and concupisence,
[1:39:17] even as the Gentiles which know not God.
[1:39:20] Paul is saying you Paul is not saying
[1:39:23] you need the Holy Ghost to be
[1:39:25] sanctified.
[1:39:26] He's saying you should know how to
[1:39:28] possess your vessel in sanctification.
[1:39:32] Are you with me?
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; That means whether you have the Holy
[1:39:36] Ghost or God gives you the baptism of
[1:39:38] the Holy Ghost or not,
[1:39:40] you should know how to possess your
[1:39:42] vessel.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Be responsible. Are you with me? Amen.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; So, um, you need to learn, in other
[1:39:50] words, young people, how lust works and
[1:39:54] be guided so you strengthen your free
[1:39:57] will. That's what I feel churches in the
[1:39:59] message need to teach young people.
[1:40:02] That's where we're failing is how to
[1:40:05] strengthen free will.
[1:40:10] How do you weaken free will? By not
[1:40:13] talking about it.
[1:40:15] How you weaken free will is by
[1:40:16] demonizing it. Making them feel like
[1:40:21] being having these desires or having
[1:40:23] these emotions or having these thoughts
[1:40:25] is lustfulness. It's sinful. It's wrong.
[1:40:28] It's that's exactly how you weaken free
[1:40:31] will. Bring it out. Talk about it. Make
[1:40:35] it normal. Make it natural.
[1:40:38] Are you with me? Something catching my
[1:40:40] throat here.
[1:40:42] So young people,
[1:40:49] how will you get the knowledge? I'm just
[1:40:51] asking you young people, how will you
[1:40:54] get the knowledge of how to strengthen
[1:40:56] your free will if you don't get drawn
[1:40:59] deeper into the word? There's no way you
[1:41:01] can you can have your free will
[1:41:03] strengthened without getting deeper into
[1:41:05] the word of God. Am I right?
[1:41:08] How can you stay sanctified if you only
[1:41:11] have time for God on Sunday?
[1:41:16] Legalists think everything can be
[1:41:18] sanctified with a literal verbal prayer.
[1:41:20] This is why you have ministers, you got
[1:41:22] problems, come, come, I'll pray for you.
[1:41:24] The moment a minister says, I'll pray
[1:41:27] for you, he's believing in him, he's a
[1:41:29] narcissist,
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; He's believing in himself like his
[1:41:33] prayer is going to solve your problem.
[1:41:36] Even if he prays for you, your faith
[1:41:39] makes you whole.
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; This isn't like sanctifying food.
[1:41:47] You're not praying for young people like
[1:41:48] you're sanctifying food.
[1:41:52] Sanctifying yourself, young people, is
[1:41:54] keeping yourself for the Lord. The same
[1:41:57] way you will keep yourself for a young
[1:41:59] girl, it should be even deeper than
[1:42:01] that. But I'm saying to you, I'm I'm
[1:42:03] showing you how to understand
[1:42:04] sanctification,
[1:42:06] right? And the strength comes from daily
[1:42:09] consecration,
[1:42:11] daily commitment, consecrating my gifts,
[1:42:14] my thoughts, my speech, my actions.
[1:42:19] This is why you can go out in the world,
[1:42:22] you can work, you can be with friends.
[1:42:23] Don't talk like them. Talk like you.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; Talk like a son of God. And don't worry,
[1:42:30] they'll get used to you. They'll say
[1:42:32] you're weird and whatever. They'll still
[1:42:34] like you. You don't have to be cool like
[1:42:36] them. Don't talk like them.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; Talk like a son of God. That's
[1:42:42] consecration. But when you don't, you
[1:42:45] are heading for a fall.
[1:42:48] Guaranteed.
[1:42:51] Okay? That's only talking. Listen, young
[1:42:55] people.
[1:42:57] You get into a friend's car to go buy
[1:43:01] pizza and that person has a gun in the
[1:43:04] car
[1:43:08] and you get stopped by the police, you
[1:43:11] are guilty by association.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; Do you understand?
[1:43:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You are guilty by association. You
[1:43:20] can be charged because how are they
[1:43:21] going to prove if that gun was used in a
[1:43:23] crime and you in a car with that person?
[1:43:25] How are you going to prove that you are
[1:43:27] not party to that crime to whatever
[1:43:29] crime was was was committed with that
[1:43:31] gun? Every one of you gets arrested and
[1:43:34] are under suspicion. You are guilty by
[1:43:37] association.
[1:43:43] So you if you are consecrated I don't
[1:43:47] want to get into I don't want to get
[1:43:49] into a car. You know the story of young
[1:43:52] people with friends getting into cars. I
[1:43:55] have lost so many friends in school who
[1:43:57] got into the car of some reckless
[1:43:59] person, crashed the car and killed an
[1:44:01] innocent child.
[1:44:04] Parents lost their children because they
[1:44:06] let their kids get into a car with some
[1:44:08] people who are absolutely irresponsible.
[1:44:12] What happened? You How many friends in
[1:44:14] my school that we lost because of
[1:44:16] irresponsibility?
[1:44:20] I'm saying to you young people, if you
[1:44:22] believe that your body is preserved for
[1:44:26] the gospel, be responsible with it.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Be sanctified. Be consecrated. And it's
[1:44:32] not hard. It's your choice. It's always
[1:44:36] your choice. There's no way around this.
[1:44:39] And there's no Holy Ghost to help you.
[1:44:41] You have to be consecrated first by your
[1:44:44] own will, then he will consecrate you.
[1:44:48] Got it? But a person can only fight when
[1:44:52] something is worth fighting for.
[1:44:59] If she's not worth fighting for, why
[1:45:01] consecrate yourself to her? Look around,
[1:45:03] man. There's many pebbles on the beach.
[1:45:07] Right? But when you're committed to her,
[1:45:09] you don't even notice other pebbles on
[1:45:11] the beach. This is the thing. If she's
[1:45:14] worth fighting for, your heart will
[1:45:16] commit.
[1:45:17] So why are you not committing to God's
[1:45:20] work? You haven't recognized that it's
[1:45:21] worth fighting for yet.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; That's simply the truth. How do I know?
[1:45:26] The Bible says, "You cannot have the
[1:45:29] love of the world and the love of God in
[1:45:30] you at the same time."
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; It's that simple. Why is the word of God
[1:45:35] worth more to me than pornography,
[1:45:38] smoking, drinking, or fornication?
[1:45:41] That's the question you want to ask
[1:45:42] yourself.
[1:45:44] Why is the word of God more important to
[1:45:46] me? If it's not, you won't fight that
[1:45:49] thing. If it is, you will fight it.
[1:45:54] There are people, listen, young people,
[1:45:56] there are people in this world who live
[1:45:58] victorious lives without knowing how or
[1:46:00] why,
[1:46:02] right? They won't even they won't even
[1:46:05] know why or take the time to because
[1:46:07] they just live consecrated lives without
[1:46:09] realizing it. You cannot be consecrated
[1:46:12] to an anointing.
[1:46:15] You can only be consecrated to a person,
[1:46:21] right? You're not consecrated to the
[1:46:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost. You're
[1:46:25] consecrated to the person.
[1:46:28] Consecration or sanctification speaks of
[1:46:30] being spiritually ambitious. Are you
[1:46:33] ambitious
[1:46:35] for God?
[1:46:38] Religious church attendance takes away
[1:46:41] spiritual ambition.
[1:46:44] Therefore, consecration.
[1:46:47] That means if you come to church out of
[1:46:49] religion, you lost ambition for God
[1:46:52] because you thought this is what you
[1:46:54] must do. You got no reason to live for
[1:46:57] him out there. You got no reason to talk
[1:47:00] about him out there. You feel ashamed to
[1:47:02] say you believe in the message of
[1:47:03] William Brandham.
[1:47:05] You feel ashamed to talk about the word.
[1:47:08] You feel ashamed to share something how
[1:47:10] God's word blessed you to a work
[1:47:12] colleague.
[1:47:14] You feel ashamed to mention oh you know
[1:47:17] this. You know the speech. Well actually
[1:47:20] we're from a church that doesn't do
[1:47:22] this. We are like that. We don't believe
[1:47:24] in that. But you skirt
[1:47:26] and never get to it.
[1:47:30] What's wrong with say I am a real
[1:47:32] Christian.
[1:47:33] I believe the word. I believe in the
[1:47:36] prophets. I believe this. I believe
[1:47:38] this. I believe this. Be consecrated.
[1:47:42] Say what you believe.
[1:47:45] That's the first step to living the
[1:47:47] truth out there.
[1:47:50] When you can't say what you believe,
[1:47:52] it's And let me tell you, boys, that
[1:47:54] time's coming because she's going to
[1:47:56] she's going to want to know whether you
[1:47:57] love her or not. Are you going to say it
[1:48:01] or not?
[1:48:04] Try it. See how well that works for you.
[1:48:08] H you She's going to want to hear that
[1:48:11] you love her. She's going to She's going
[1:48:13] to want to know that you love her. And
[1:48:16] you can act it all out or act like
[1:48:18] you're interested. She'll choose
[1:48:20] somebody else. That's how it is.
[1:48:25] Let's go to the message thirst. Proverb
[1:48:27] 143.
[1:48:29] Let me tell you something. When you are
[1:48:30] worshiping God in spirit and in truth,
[1:48:32] when it becomes a custom for you to do
[1:48:34] it because you think you ought to
[1:48:37] because you think if you don't shout or
[1:48:39] jump or dance with music, your neighbor
[1:48:41] is going to think you're backslid, you
[1:48:43] are drinking from a stagnated stream.
[1:48:47] Do you hear me? If you are serving God
[1:48:50] in this message because you think you
[1:48:52] have to, because it's a custom, you are
[1:48:54] drinking from a stagnated stream.
[1:48:59] Question three. I don't want to
[1:49:01] elaborate too much. I want to get to the
[1:49:04] the end. Is it even possible to overcome
[1:49:06] sin without having the baptism of the
[1:49:09] Holy Ghost?
[1:49:11] What do you mean by sin? If you mean
[1:49:14] addictions and wrong things, the answer
[1:49:16] is of course.
[1:49:18] It's possible to overcome sin without
[1:49:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:49:23] Right? You can overcome all that without
[1:49:25] even being a Christian. Yeah.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Do people in the world live without
[1:49:29] fornication or adultery without the Holy
[1:49:31] Ghost? Yes.
[1:49:33] How do they do it? Why is it that only
[1:49:37] message youth need the Holy Ghost to
[1:49:40] quit fornication?
[1:49:43] Huh? Why? Why is it do Buddhist monks
[1:49:46] have the power of the Holy Ghost?
[1:49:50] There are so many people in the world
[1:49:51] who don't go to church, who don't cheat
[1:49:53] on their spouses, and don't use
[1:49:55] pornography. How do they do it? Do they
[1:49:57] have the Holy Ghost?
[1:49:59] There are thousands of people, do you
[1:50:01] know thousands of people in the world
[1:50:03] today who have televisions in their
[1:50:04] homes and not addicted to movies?
[1:50:07] How do they do it?
[1:50:10] They are only watching news and sports
[1:50:12] and most of them can go through a whole
[1:50:15] week without watching a single thing.
[1:50:18] Why do message people have so much of
[1:50:20] trouble with this thing?
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; There are millions of people in the
[1:50:25] world who don't have rules like us who
[1:50:28] will not listen to hip-hop
[1:50:31] or pop music there. Do you know how many
[1:50:35] people in the world think all that is
[1:50:36] rubbish? They only listen to Mozart and
[1:50:38] Beethoven. Do they have the Holy Ghost?
[1:50:44] No. They have a taste for something
[1:50:47] else.
[1:50:49] Therefore, they are committed to
[1:50:50] something else.
[1:50:52] You have a problem with taste.
[1:50:57] There are people in this world who
[1:51:00] choose to be single, who stay away from
[1:51:03] politics, who are atheists, they don't
[1:51:06] drink alcohol, they don't smoke, they
[1:51:07] don't fight, they hate war, they only
[1:51:09] eat vegetables.
[1:51:13] They do all that without the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:17] Huh? Do they need the Holy Ghost? No. So
[1:51:20] why do you need a quick fix?
[1:51:23] It's simple. It's what you want to do.
[1:51:27] See, because religion gives you a false
[1:51:30] sense of security and a cloak for
[1:51:34] uncleanness,
[1:51:36] right? That's when you think uh uh it's
[1:51:41] easily or or rather let's say this way.
[1:51:44] Let's ask it this way this question. Why
[1:51:47] is it that religious people are so
[1:51:50] encumbered with burdens of
[1:51:52] unrighteousness
[1:51:54] when they should be the ones that are
[1:51:57] victorious?
[1:52:00] Because religion gives you a false sense
[1:52:03] of security.
[1:52:05] You think you need religion to overcome
[1:52:07] those things. There are people in the
[1:52:09] world without your religion that
[1:52:11] overcome it.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is possible to live righteously
[1:52:19] without the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:52:21] It is possible to live clean without the
[1:52:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So, don't use
[1:52:25] it as an excuse.
[1:52:28] It's not an it's not a good enough
[1:52:29] excuse.
[1:52:31] Question four. stages of new birth like
[1:52:34] justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:52:36] of the Holy Ghost. Isn't he speaking
[1:52:38] about church ages? Is he mentioning that
[1:52:40] an individual to have to undergo first
[1:52:42] two stages before he would receive the
[1:52:44] Holy Ghost? Listen saints, the three
[1:52:46] stages were for the church. Absolutely.
[1:52:48] But also for the individual, you need to
[1:52:51] go through that, right? It's a it's an
[1:52:54] important part of your development. Uh
[1:52:56] I've spoken about this before when I
[1:52:58] speak about justification,
[1:52:59] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[1:53:00] Ghost. I studied it under the trumpets.
[1:53:03] I remember I spoke about it being like
[1:53:05] the three world wars. To me it's every
[1:53:08] single one is at war. It's not some
[1:53:11] uh uh experience where you you just
[1:53:14] come. Brother said salvation is a messy
[1:53:16] thing,
[1:53:18] right? They are wars. It's like the
[1:53:20] sixth seal being let loose on your body
[1:53:24] because you're trying to do things. You
[1:53:26] come from a place where you're thinking
[1:53:27] something else and now you get the word
[1:53:29] which challenges your thinking and now
[1:53:31] you have to change your thinking. It's a
[1:53:33] war.
[1:53:35] Amen. In a time where the world has
[1:53:37] become almost impossible. Listen young
[1:53:40] people. This world is priming you to be
[1:53:42] self-centered.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; That means think of yourself.
[1:53:48] My satisfaction, my entertainment, my
[1:53:50] enjoyment, who I am, this is for me.
[1:53:53] It's it's serving you on a plate to be
[1:53:56] self-centered.
[1:53:59] It's it's actually harder than it was in
[1:54:01] that day. Let's go to question two,
[1:54:04] which has got to do with evidence of the
[1:54:06] Holy Ghost. Definite experience of the
[1:54:08] Holy Ghost versus a change or deviation
[1:54:10] in individual's life, a purposeful
[1:54:13] nature. Let's read the question.
[1:54:16] Whenever someone asks me about how does
[1:54:18] someone know for sure that they received
[1:54:20] the Holy Ghost, I find it difficult to
[1:54:21] answer. In my case, it was simple. My
[1:54:24] earlier life was so bad and after that
[1:54:26] one particular event, my life changed
[1:54:28] completely. I know definitely that it
[1:54:30] has happened because I know the results
[1:54:32] it brought in my life. But for some
[1:54:34] people, this may not be true. Some
[1:54:36] youngsters live a good life from their
[1:54:38] childhood and they find it difficult to
[1:54:40] differentiate between Holy Ghost baptism
[1:54:42] and after Holy Ghost baptism. They tell
[1:54:44] me they still make mistakes. Then how
[1:54:46] can it be the Holy Ghost? I even heard
[1:54:49] on tape that one should look shouldn't
[1:54:51] look for a perfect sinless life to say
[1:54:53] that they are truly born again. So when
[1:54:55] I tell them that one could make mistakes
[1:54:57] even after getting the Holy Ghost with
[1:54:59] quotes they start questioning like what
[1:55:01] is the reason for giving us the Holy
[1:55:03] Ghost if we are still vulnerable? How if
[1:55:06] we have the the spirit of Christ can we
[1:55:09] have anger etc.
[1:55:11] Recently I gave an example to a sister
[1:55:14] about sister Bruce uh how brother Madam
[1:55:16] explains to her that we are born as
[1:55:18] sinners but at a certain time our life
[1:55:20] got changed. If there is deviation in
[1:55:22] our lives it could only be due to the
[1:55:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Deviation
[1:55:26] meaning your purpose is changed. Okay.
[1:55:29] Uh this is exactly in line with what you
[1:55:31] preached about purposeful nature. I was
[1:55:33] very excited when you preached this
[1:55:34] line. This has helped someone in our
[1:55:36] church get the understanding they need.
[1:55:38] But my main question is how can we help
[1:55:40] people to know whether they received it
[1:55:42] or not especially for those youngsters
[1:55:44] who don't or who don't have a bad past
[1:55:47] to compare with. You have touched this
[1:55:50] point at a high level on few occasions
[1:55:52] but would like to know if you can give
[1:55:53] more clarity on the subject. Okay. So I
[1:55:56] did say this to you before. Why would
[1:55:59] you need evidence
[1:56:01] of the Holy Ghost? Because you are
[1:56:03] unsure.
[1:56:05] That's the only reason. Anyone who needs
[1:56:07] evidence means you are unsure. Why are
[1:56:09] you unsure.
[1:56:11] You see, I don't There's a lot of smoke.
[1:56:13] There's a lot of noise. I like to cut
[1:56:15] straight through that, right? Why do you
[1:56:18] need evidence? Because you're unsure.
[1:56:20] Why are you unsure? A few reasons. The
[1:56:22] main reason is you've been taught wrong
[1:56:26] or you interpreted what you've been
[1:56:28] taught. You've interpreted wrong what
[1:56:31] you've been taught. Okay. First you have
[1:56:34] to identify what evidence are you
[1:56:36] looking for. Are you looking for
[1:56:38] evidence of the person or evidence of
[1:56:40] the anointing or ability? The evidence
[1:56:43] most people are looking for is I want to
[1:56:46] be sinless. That's not the evidence.
[1:56:50] I want to be righteous. I just taught
[1:56:52] you you can be righteous without it.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; That's not the evidence.
[1:56:59] All right. So, you're looking for the
[1:57:01] wrong thing. determine what evidence you
[1:57:04] were looking for. Like like when I read
[1:57:05] the quote preaching on a subject, you
[1:57:08] can only receive the Holy Ghost if you
[1:57:09] know what it is, if you know what
[1:57:11] results it brings, if you know that it's
[1:57:14] for you and you believe it's for you,
[1:57:17] then you know what you have and you get
[1:57:18] it. Right? So if you need evidence of
[1:57:21] the person, what is that supposed to
[1:57:23] look like? You say maybe evidence of the
[1:57:26] power, evidence of the gifts is
[1:57:29] something. What evidence is there of the
[1:57:31] person? It's like when you bring a girl
[1:57:34] home and you tell your mom you're in
[1:57:35] love with her and your mom says, "Hold
[1:57:37] on. How do you know you're in love with
[1:57:39] her?
[1:57:40] Where's she from? What's her family
[1:57:42] like? What degrees does she have? How
[1:57:44] much money do they have?" Mom, that's
[1:57:46] not my evidence. Then what's your
[1:57:48] evidence? You just met her 3 months ago.
[1:57:54] Some of you might have been through
[1:57:55] that.
[1:57:57] If you determine evidence by those
[1:58:00] things, you are looking for the evidence
[1:58:03] of of an ability and not the evidence of
[1:58:06] the person, right? If you need evidence
[1:58:10] of the person, what is that supposed to
[1:58:12] look like? Okay? When you have the
[1:58:15] person, it takes away sin. And what is
[1:58:19] sin?
[1:58:21] Unbelief.
[1:58:23] The evidence of the person is unbelief
[1:58:27] being taken away.
[1:58:29] Right? You will never disbelieve God's
[1:58:33] word. Evidence of the anointing is the
[1:58:36] manifestation of a particular ability.
[1:58:40] Like for example, I used to be a person
[1:58:43] that couldn't even say a speech in
[1:58:44] school. I used to be a person who was so
[1:58:46] nervous to say a speech. I would sweat.
[1:58:49] I would be nervous. Have you ever seen
[1:58:51] those? I felt so sorry for those young
[1:58:53] boys be holding their speech cards and
[1:58:55] they're like
[1:59:00] absolutely nervous stutter and then you
[1:59:03] get the Holy Ghost and then you stand in
[1:59:04] front of a thousand people and speak the
[1:59:06] word.
[1:59:07] That's an ability of the gift and
[1:59:10] evidence of the gift because you know on
[1:59:13] your own you're so nervous your stomach
[1:59:16] is churning inside. What gives you the
[1:59:19] ability? Only the Holy Ghost. But what's
[1:59:21] the evidence of the person? You believe
[1:59:27] evidence of the anointing is
[1:59:29] manifestation.
[1:59:31] You still have to have
[1:59:33] you're still going to have failures,
[1:59:36] people. You're still going to have
[1:59:37] mistakes and you might even have
[1:59:40] backslideness time to time.
[1:59:43] Even the prophet came on the pulpit and
[1:59:46] confessed things. And I'm not talking
[1:59:48] about bad things. Brother Baron would
[1:59:50] even say, "I really didn't want to come
[1:59:51] to church today. I made all the excuses
[1:59:54] to myself." Can you believe that? A
[1:59:56] prophet making excuses about coming to
[1:59:58] church.
[2:00:01] And he said, "It's only the Holy Ghost
[2:00:03] that brought me here."
[2:00:06] H the person comes without sensation.
[2:00:10] It is a deep realization inside. You
[2:00:12] meet the person first, then he justifies
[2:00:15] you. Then you will desire to be
[2:00:17] sanctified to him. Then he will give you
[2:00:20] his anointing and finally he will become
[2:00:22] you. That's the process. Write it down.
[2:00:26] When you grow up and you live a
[2:00:28] sanctified life as a child of a message
[2:00:31] believer, you've been living a
[2:00:33] sanctified life without meeting the
[2:00:35] person. That was me. I grew up in
[2:00:39] brother Steve's home. I grew up in the
[2:00:41] message. I lived a sanctified life
[2:00:44] without meeting the person.
[2:00:47] I dressed right. I lived in the message.
[2:00:49] I was in church every week, every day,
[2:00:51] sometimes seven days a week. I sang only
[2:00:54] Christian songs. I did not have a
[2:00:56] television in our house. I did not
[2:00:57] smoke. I did not drink. I lived a
[2:01:00] sanctified life. My whole life
[2:01:03] sanctified without meeting the person.
[2:01:08] And it came to a point where I realized
[2:01:09] I didn't know the person.
[2:01:13] Now, what's going to help me?
[2:01:16] You can't tell me I'm a sinner. I've
[2:01:17] been living right all along. I've been
[2:01:20] speaking right, not swearing. Well, that
[2:01:23] was because when I was five, I swore
[2:01:25] once. My mom put chili powder in my
[2:01:27] mouth. That was the end. There was no
[2:01:28] faith involved there. I just knew it,
[2:01:32] right?
[2:01:34] There was no faith at all. No way. Chili
[2:01:36] powder is happening again. But those
[2:01:39] things worked. Okay? So I live a
[2:01:41] sanctified life my whole life. Don't
[2:01:43] know the person. What's going to work
[2:01:45] for me now? Holy Ghost service
[2:01:49] repentance. From what to what?
[2:01:55] Amen.
[2:01:57] The person comes with a deep realization
[2:02:00] inside. You have to meet that person.
[2:02:02] You will justify you. If you meet the
[2:02:05] person, you will still. So I'm telling
[2:02:07] you young people, those of you, I'm
[2:02:08] talking to those people, young people
[2:02:10] who live in the message. You've been
[2:02:12] brought up under a message parent.
[2:02:13] You've been living right. You've been
[2:02:14] taught to speak right. You are in every
[2:02:16] church service. You are dressing right.
[2:02:18] You are not smoking. You're not
[2:02:20] drinking. You don't have any wrong
[2:02:22] things to repent from. You have to meet
[2:02:25] the person someday
[2:02:27] because you've just you've just been a
[2:02:29] good follower of a culture, right? If
[2:02:33] you meet the person, guess what's going
[2:02:35] to happen? Nothing.
[2:02:38] You're still going to live like you did
[2:02:40] before.
[2:02:42] There's no change. You're still going to
[2:02:44] come to church. You're still going to
[2:02:45] dress right. So, what changes there?
[2:02:48] Nothing with the rest of your life.
[2:02:50] Something changes inside.
[2:02:53] Amen. You meet the person, there's no
[2:02:56] change to your life on the outside. No
[2:02:58] difference. But when you meet the
[2:03:00] person, your focus changes. You have a
[2:03:03] purpose beyond what you have in life.
[2:03:05] Suddenly you can stand up and say,
[2:03:07] "There's something for me to do for
[2:03:09] God." You feel incentivized. I'm not
[2:03:12] just coming here to be a part of the
[2:03:14] movement. There's something more for me.
[2:03:16] There's something deeper. Right? Let's
[2:03:19] go to question three, which which is our
[2:03:21] main question.
[2:03:23] When would we stop making mistakes?
[2:03:26] Anybody want to answer?
[2:03:32] All right, let's read the question. Is
[2:03:34] that we can never is it that we can
[2:03:37] never be so close to God that we
[2:03:39] couldn't fall? I heard from a preacher
[2:03:41] that when we have the attributes from
[2:03:43] stat statue of a perfect man, we will
[2:03:45] not fall again. He quoted the following
[2:03:48] scripture 2 Peter 1:10 which we read in
[2:03:51] the beginning. Wherefore the rather
[2:03:52] brethren, give diligence to make your
[2:03:54] calling and election sure. If you do
[2:03:56] these things, you shall never fall. Is
[2:03:58] this correct understanding according to
[2:04:00] the prophet?
[2:04:02] Firstly, you shall never fall. What does
[2:04:05] that mean?
[2:04:08] H is it is falling from the purpose of
[2:04:11] God. It is falling into unbelief. If you
[2:04:15] have these things, you shall never fall.
[2:04:18] You shall never fall from your purpose.
[2:04:21] It is disbelieving. Right? The virtues
[2:04:25] was about strength and character for
[2:04:28] purpose.
[2:04:30] If you have them, it shows consecration.
[2:04:33] Consecration for a purpose. It is
[2:04:37] necessary, right? It's like virtues that
[2:04:40] are required to be faithful, to be
[2:04:42] sanctified to the woman. I was talking
[2:04:44] about the or the man you're in love
[2:04:46] with. You need virtues. So if you're
[2:04:49] consecrate, if you're dedicated to that
[2:04:50] girl you're in love with whom you
[2:04:52] haven't told, you are going to change
[2:04:54] yourself.
[2:04:56] What are you going to do? You're going
[2:04:57] to have faith in her. You're going to
[2:05:00] give yourself virtue. You're not going
[2:05:01] to look at others, right? You're going
[2:05:04] to have knowledge. You're going to learn
[2:05:05] everything you can about her. You're
[2:05:06] going to have patience. You're going to
[2:05:08] endure.
[2:05:10] Look at that. What is godliness?
[2:05:12] Godliness is staying within what you're
[2:05:15] supposed to do for a purpose. for the
[2:05:18] purpose of God. You're going to be
[2:05:19] dedicated to her. You're going to do
[2:05:20] things that you know you think she might
[2:05:23] like.
[2:05:26] Of course, you're also going to be like
[2:05:27] brotherly kindness on your best
[2:05:29] behavior,
[2:05:30] right?
[2:05:32] This is what it is. They're virtues that
[2:05:35] show consecration.
[2:05:38] The simple answer is the baptism of the
[2:05:40] Holy Ghost is given to you to give you
[2:05:42] ability to bring your purpose to pass.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:47] You may never know or need to know how
[2:05:51] it is being used.
[2:05:54] You have a gift.
[2:05:57] You know, I I don't have enough time in
[2:05:59] my life to be able to explain all this.
[2:06:01] It's simply the truth. I wish there were
[2:06:03] more than 24 hours in a day.
[2:06:07] Uh it's like this. When you head to work
[2:06:11] one day, are you even anticipating
[2:06:13] meeting someone who's going to ask a
[2:06:15] question that is related to God?
[2:06:18] You you don't you're not ready for it.
[2:06:21] There's no exam to work for. There's no
[2:06:24] studying you can you can make yourself
[2:06:27] ready for for that on that day. It's
[2:06:29] going to happen. And at that day, the
[2:06:32] words will be in your mouth if you are
[2:06:35] consecrated.
[2:06:40] So the simple answer is the baptism of
[2:06:43] the Holy Ghost is given to you to give
[2:06:45] you ability to bring the word to pass.
[2:06:46] Listen young people, saints of God, you
[2:06:50] may never stop making some mistakes.
[2:06:52] Even if you have the baptism of the Holy
[2:06:54] Ghost, you are still going to struggle
[2:06:56] with your failures, but they will
[2:06:59] certainly decrease
[2:07:02] as you become more faithful to the word.
[2:07:05] And maturity of character will help you
[2:07:08] make better choices and make mistakes
[2:07:10] less and less and you become better
[2:07:13] until you take control of them. Stop
[2:07:17] being a chicken
[2:07:19] and asking for God to take control of
[2:07:22] your mistakes.
[2:07:24] He wants you to get the victory.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; He wants to fortify you with the word so
[2:07:30] you take control. Yes.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; This idea of Lord, you take control.
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; No. I'm sorry. That's Pentecostalism.
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; Are you ready for this? I don't think
[2:07:44] you're ready for this.
[2:07:48] Religious message people.
[2:07:51] Let's read. Stature of a perfect man of
[2:07:53] all places.
[2:07:56] See these fellows wasn't required. What
[2:07:58] these fellows was? This wasn't required.
[2:08:01] what this was. See that he brought his
[2:08:03] church up the same way. He brought his
[2:08:05] church up the same way he's bringing uh
[2:08:07] the people his people up. Then Peter
[2:08:10] here says first things faith, virtue see
[2:08:14] coming up knowledge, temperance,
[2:08:15] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness,
[2:08:16] brotherly kindness and then the love of
[2:08:18] God, the Holy Ghost. The Christ in the
[2:08:22] person of the Holy Ghost comes upon you
[2:08:24] in the true baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:25] and you got all his virtues sealed in.
[2:08:28] Then God lives in a tabernacle called
[2:08:30] the building, the living tabernacle of
[2:08:32] the living God's dwelling place. When a
[2:08:35] man possesses these kind of things, then
[2:08:38] the Holy Ghost comes upon him. No matter
[2:08:40] you might speak with tongues, you might
[2:08:42] impersonate any gift that God's got. You
[2:08:44] might do that, but until these virtues
[2:08:46] here go into you, you're still off the
[2:08:49] real true foundation of faith. But when
[2:08:52] these virtues grow in, as you added that
[2:08:54] to that, then you are living monument.
[2:08:56] You are living moving idol.
[2:09:02] You are living idol
[2:09:05] means you become the perfect embodiment
[2:09:07] of God that other people will recognize
[2:09:10] God in and worship him.
[2:09:16] you know, speaking on the virtues and
[2:09:19] you know, last week's service
[2:09:23] I I don't know I um speaking on the the
[2:09:26] doctrines of the message, you know,
[2:09:28] people do get offended by it. They never
[2:09:31] really listen to it properly.
[2:09:33] But do you know you will never even find
[2:09:36] in the message where brother Ben Baram
[2:09:38] even uses the phrase seven virtues.
[2:09:42] Did you know that?
[2:09:44] There there isn't even a place where he
[2:09:46] even relates the virtues to the
[2:09:48] thunders.
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; Never.
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; You're not.
[2:09:52] &gt;&gt; We got so used to call it the seven
[2:09:54] virtues. Brother Benham doesn't even
[2:09:55] call it that.
[2:09:57] &gt;&gt; He may even call it the virtues of God,
[2:10:00] right? But because the Greeks came up
[2:10:03] with virtues and then you know it became
[2:10:05] seven virtues in the Catholic Church and
[2:10:07] then we come to the end and of course
[2:10:09] there's seven virtues and there's
[2:10:11] actually eight there.
[2:10:15] faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance,
[2:10:16] patience, godliness, brotherly kindness,
[2:10:18] charity,
[2:10:21] &gt;&gt; eight,
[2:10:22] &gt;&gt; add to faith.
[2:10:24] So if you if you take away charity, then
[2:10:27] there are seven. And then brother
[2:10:28] Brandham explains how the Holy Ghost
[2:10:30] comes and seals it in and charity comes
[2:10:32] down,
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; right? But nowhere in the message will
[2:10:36] you find brother Brandham even calling
[2:10:38] it seven virtues.
[2:10:41] totally totally made up.
[2:10:44] There's nothing wrong with it. When I
[2:10:46] preach about it, I call it the seven
[2:10:47] virtues because we've gotten used to
[2:10:49] speaking about it, right? It they may
[2:10:54] even though the the the seven virtues
[2:10:56] people put these things together by
[2:10:59] trying to make sense of it, they made a
[2:11:02] lot more sense than other doctrines,
[2:11:04] I'll tell you that. Than other doctrines
[2:11:07] I've heard. But it was not enough to
[2:11:09] bring the most important thing. With all
[2:11:11] the seven virtues that you preach about
[2:11:14] that they preached about for for for
[2:11:16] decades,
[2:11:18] one thing was lacking. Humility.
[2:11:24] If you look at the proponents of it,
[2:11:26] there's no humility.
[2:11:29] How can you have those virtues without
[2:11:31] humility?
[2:11:33] So young people, listen up. If we take
[2:11:37] the name away, let's take the name away.
[2:11:40] Let's take the name seven virtues away.
[2:11:42] Let's take the name virtues away. Let's
[2:11:45] say characteristics. What is it saying?
[2:11:48] If you examine all these
[2:11:49] characteristics, faith, virtue,
[2:11:50] knowledge, temperance, patience,
[2:11:51] godliness, brotherly kindness. Peter is
[2:11:54] saying add to your faith. He didn't say
[2:11:58] Holy Ghost must add it. Said you add to
[2:12:00] it.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; Add to your faith virtue. Add to your
[2:12:03] virtue knowledge. Add to your knowledge
[2:12:06] patience.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; He didn't say God must do it. He said
[2:12:09] you must do it.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Everything the prophet speaks about in
[2:12:15] here young people is about you becoming
[2:12:18] a nicer person
[2:12:23] message people become nicer people.
[2:12:29] And this is where I want to I want to
[2:12:30] talk to you. Too many of you younger
[2:12:33] people, young people, you want the Holy
[2:12:35] Ghost to fight off pornography,
[2:12:37] addictions, whatever weaknesses, but
[2:12:40] you're not willing to become a nicer
[2:12:42] person.
[2:12:45] You're not willing to be humble and
[2:12:46] shake off pride. You don't mind being
[2:12:49] arrogant and disrespectful to elders.
[2:12:52] You don't mind being worldly and acting
[2:12:54] like Hollywood and meddling in worldly
[2:12:56] music, but you want the Holy Ghost to
[2:12:58] take away an addiction.
[2:12:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You don't mind dressing like the
[2:13:01] world, talking like the world. You don't
[2:13:04] mind believing in worldly philosophies
[2:13:06] over the Bible because it's an ancient
[2:13:08] manuscript and it judges modern life.
[2:13:11] The person of the Holy Ghost cannot come
[2:13:13] upon a nature like that.
[2:13:18] Faith is unadulterated belief in the
[2:13:20] word for your day. Virtue is I'm I'm
[2:13:24] telling you what those characteristics
[2:13:26] are. What is faith?
[2:13:29] Add to your faith. What is faith? Let's
[2:13:31] start there. Faith is unadulterated
[2:13:34] belief in the word for your day. Do you
[2:13:37] have that?
[2:13:39] Do you believe that God is God?
[2:13:43] Do you believe that the Lord Jesus
[2:13:45] Christ died to save you from your sins?
[2:13:48] Do you believe that the message of the
[2:13:50] hour that was brought by this prophet is
[2:13:52] the saving grace for this day? Start
[2:13:55] there. Do you believe that?
[2:13:58] When you believe that, add virtue to
[2:14:01] your faith. What is virtue? Living true
[2:14:04] to yourself and faith in the word.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; What is knowledge? Understanding of the
[2:14:10] word. What is temperance? The ability to
[2:14:12] control your tongue and your actions.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; What is patience? Endurance during times
[2:14:18] of trials and struggle. What is
[2:14:20] godliness? Consecration to the word and
[2:14:23] the body of Christ. What is brotherly
[2:14:26] kindness? being unselfish, not
[2:14:29] self-centered and thoughtfulness for
[2:14:31] others.
[2:14:34] Be a nicer person.
[2:14:37] You want the Holy Ghost, don't make
[2:14:39] excuses.
[2:14:41] Don't go to youth camps and youth
[2:14:43] meetings and expect us to produce some
[2:14:45] kind of magical anointing that's going
[2:14:46] to suddenly make you a nicer person.
[2:14:52] If you want the Holy Ghost, make it your
[2:14:54] everyday purpose to have these
[2:14:56] characteristics, even if it means
[2:14:58] denying yourself some pleasures. I do
[2:15:01] it. No one else does it in this message.
[2:15:05] Do you know how much we've denied to
[2:15:07] bring you your you children up in the
[2:15:09] ways of God? Do you know how much we've
[2:15:12] had to sacrifice? I'm not trying to make
[2:15:14] you feel bad. I'm just telling you the
[2:15:16] truth. I don't feel bad. I didn't
[2:15:18] struggle to to to give up pleasures in
[2:15:20] this life. I love the life I lead in
[2:15:23] God. Okay? But I'm telling you, the
[2:15:26] amount of things we've had to do to
[2:15:28] bring you up, to bring you where you
[2:15:30] are, to teach you the gospel, it's not
[2:15:32] even abstinence.
[2:15:34] Don't struggle. Here's it. Here it is,
[2:15:38] brother L. I struggle to stay away from
[2:15:41] this thing. Stop it.
[2:15:43] Stop struggling to stay away from it.
[2:15:46] attach yourself to God.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; It's not abstinence. You You try
[2:15:54] struggling to stay away from something.
[2:15:56] That's focusing on yourself. That's
[2:15:59] acting like a victim. I have a problem.
[2:16:01] I have a problem. I can't stay away from
[2:16:03] it. I can't give this thing up. Stop
[2:16:05] trying to give it up. Give yourself to
[2:16:07] God.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Attach yourself to him. You won't have
[2:16:11] to struggle to give that thing up.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:15] Start with faith. See, don't tell me
[2:16:19] you're committed to God when you don't
[2:16:22] read the Bible. You don't pray with
[2:16:24] earnesty. You don't believe you get up
[2:16:27] and go to work or university or school
[2:16:28] and you don't believe in God's presence
[2:16:31] being with you to protect you on the
[2:16:33] road.
[2:16:37] Didn't think about that.
[2:16:40] Why should God protect me on the road?
[2:16:43] because I want to live to serve him.
[2:16:47] Okay. Ordination message ordination.
[2:16:51] Remember this morning's lesson. These
[2:16:53] virtues has to be in there before the
[2:16:54] capsule will ever come in. You might
[2:16:57] shout, you might sing, you might speak
[2:16:59] with tongues and dance. That has nothing
[2:17:00] to do with it. Until these scriptural
[2:17:02] proven is sealed unto you, the Holy
[2:17:04] Spirit seals you in as an individual.
[2:17:06] Then you're a son and daughter of God.
[2:17:08] Amen. The next quote, living, dying,
[2:17:11] buried, rising.
[2:17:14] Listen, go and read this at home. I want
[2:17:16] to I want to get through it quickly.
[2:17:18] It's got to be you. My emotions has
[2:17:20] brought me to this altar, but now it
[2:17:22] takes your spirit to change me.
[2:17:25] Right? My emotions. This is where you
[2:17:28] can do all of these things. Maybe your
[2:17:30] emotions brought to the altar, but God
[2:17:32] has to change you.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; God has to change what? something inside
[2:17:37] you to put you into his purpose.
[2:17:40] But if you believe him and if you love
[2:17:42] him, you're going to want to change.
[2:17:45] You can't lie to me. I know you can do
[2:17:47] it. I've seen a boy who can be a total
[2:17:50] slur fall in love with a girl and change
[2:17:53] overnight.
[2:17:55] Why can't you do that for God?
[2:17:58] You're not expecting her to give you
[2:18:00] some anointing.
[2:18:05] See? Okay, let's get to the next thing.
[2:18:09] Sins and being not perfect. Okay, I want
[2:18:12] to go through these scriptures really
[2:18:14] quickly. First Kings 8:4 uh 46. If they
[2:18:17] sin against thee, for there is no man
[2:18:20] that's there's scripture. There is no
[2:18:22] man that sinnth not. Thou be angry with
[2:18:25] them, deliver them to the enemy, so they
[2:18:26] carry away captives and so on.
[2:18:28] Ecclesiastes 7:20. For there is not a
[2:18:31] just man upon the earth that doeth good
[2:18:33] and sinnth not. 1 John 3:6. Whosoever
[2:18:36] abideth in him sinnth not. Whosoever
[2:18:39] sinnth have not seen him neither known
[2:18:41] him. 1 John 5:16. If any man see his
[2:18:44] brother sin a sin, that which is not a
[2:18:47] sin unto death, he shall ask, and he
[2:18:49] shall give him life for that sin that
[2:18:51] not for that sin not unto death. There
[2:18:54] is a sin unto death. I do not say that
[2:18:56] he shall pray for it. So this scripture
[2:18:58] tells you there is a sin unto death.
[2:19:00] There is sin that is not unto death.
[2:19:03] Sin unto death is unbelief. There are
[2:19:06] sins that we do in our lives or wrong
[2:19:09] things or bad things that is not unto
[2:19:11] death. The Bible is telling us that what
[2:19:14] separates you from God is disbelieving
[2:19:17] God.
[2:19:21] &gt;&gt; 1 John 1:8-10. If we say we have no sin,
[2:19:25] we deceive ourselves. and the truth is
[2:19:27] not in us. How can he say this and then
[2:19:30] say he who's born of God does not commit
[2:19:32] sin? In other words, he's saying if you
[2:19:35] say you don't have wrong bad things in
[2:19:37] your life, you're lying because we all
[2:19:39] have it. If we confess it, he is
[2:19:42] faithful and just to forgive us and to
[2:19:45] cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; If we say we have not sinned, we make
[2:19:50] him a liar
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; and his word is not in us. So this idea
[2:19:54] that you come to God, he gives you the
[2:19:56] Holy Ghost, and you have no bad things
[2:19:58] in your life is false.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; You're always going to have bad things.
[2:20:02] You're always going to struggle with
[2:20:03] unrighteousness, but you'll never
[2:20:05] struggle with unbelief.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Fornication
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; is a sin against your own body.
[2:20:16] It's not even a sin against God. How can
[2:20:18] the Bible say fornication is so young
[2:20:21] people if you fornicate? Let's read 1
[2:20:23] Corinthians 6:18-19.
[2:20:26] Flee fornication. Every sin that a man
[2:20:28] doeth is, let me explain that to you.
[2:20:30] You drink, you smoke, you curse, you
[2:20:33] lie, you do all of those things. It's a
[2:20:36] sin outside of your body.
[2:20:40] You commit fornication,
[2:20:42] illegal sexual activity without
[2:20:44] marriage, it's a sin against your own
[2:20:46] body. Yes,
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; you get married, you commit adultery.
[2:20:51] Adultery is a is a spiritual thing.
[2:20:53] Fornication is the act. Adultery is
[2:20:56] while you are married and falling in
[2:20:58] love with someone else. That's adultery.
[2:21:00] That's breaking of vows. Fornication is
[2:21:03] the act. You can have you can commit
[2:21:06] adultery without fornication.
[2:21:10] You know that you can be married to
[2:21:12] someone and fall in love with someone
[2:21:14] else and it's adultery though you
[2:21:16] haven't slept with them. But if you
[2:21:18] slept with them, you committed adultery
[2:21:20] and fornication.
[2:21:25] Are you with me?
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; Why is fornication a sin against your
[2:21:29] own body? Because it literally affects
[2:21:32] your body.
[2:21:35] It changes your body.
[2:21:38] It breaks your nature. It's like the
[2:21:41] first time when the two in the Garden of
[2:21:44] Eden once they had committed the act
[2:21:48] there was no going back.
[2:21:51] Do you understand?
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Once you've been with another person,
[2:21:54] you cannot erase it. It's there.
[2:21:59] It's going to be there with you for the
[2:22:00] rest of your life. There's no way to
[2:22:02] erase it. You sinned against your own
[2:22:05] body, not even God. You have affected
[2:22:08] yourself.
[2:22:10] This is what I was teaching these young
[2:22:11] people when I was speaking in Canada.
[2:22:12] It's a sin against your own body. What?
[2:22:15] And he's trying to tell you, do you not
[2:22:16] know you're the temple of the Holy Ghost
[2:22:18] which you which you are of God. You are
[2:22:20] not your own. This body you have
[2:22:22] consecrated to God. Why would you want
[2:22:24] to then go and damage it by sinning
[2:22:27] against it?
[2:22:29] That's why he's saying flee fornication.
[2:22:32] He's not saying get the Holy Ghost to
[2:22:34] help you flee fornication. He's saying
[2:22:36] by your own will don't do it.
[2:22:40] 1 Corinthians 7:36. If any man think
[2:22:43] that he behaveth himself uncommonly
[2:22:44] toward his virgin, if she pass the
[2:22:46] flower of her age and needs to require,
[2:22:48] let him do what he will. He sinnth not,
[2:22:51] let him marry. There's no sin in getting
[2:22:53] married. Get married and then be with
[2:22:55] your wife or your husband. There's no
[2:22:57] sin in that. if you have a problem. In
[2:22:59] other words, he's saying Paul actually
[2:23:01] gives us the the the solution to
[2:23:03] fornication in 1 Corinthians 7, saying,
[2:23:05] "Get married to avoid fornication."
[2:23:10] Amen.
[2:23:13] Does God ever change his mind about his
[2:23:14] word?
[2:23:16] I'm going to go to the highlighted part.
[2:23:17] See, God permitted Israel. Okay. Part of
[2:23:21] 97. It's best to have God's will. That's
[2:23:23] what he taught us. Thy will be done. Thy
[2:23:25] kingdom come, thy will be done. We must
[2:23:27] submit oursel to his will and his word.
[2:23:29] Don't question it. Believe it. Don't try
[2:23:31] to find a way around it. Just take it
[2:23:33] the way it is. So many wants to go
[2:23:35] around get some other way. And when you
[2:23:38] do, you find yourself going on, you find
[2:23:39] God blessing you, but you're working in
[2:23:41] his permissible will and not his perfect
[2:23:43] divine will. Are you still with me? He
[2:23:45] permits it as I said, but he will not he
[2:23:48] will not let it be his perfect will, but
[2:23:50] he'll make it work to honor and and
[2:23:52] bless his perfect will. He's and
[2:23:55] childbearing by sex is one of them. He's
[2:23:57] allowed sexuality to be here as a
[2:24:00] permissive will because we need to bring
[2:24:03] forth children. We need to bond in
[2:24:04] marriages. We're not in the perfect
[2:24:06] state before then. God has permitted
[2:24:08] that. But it's permitted within
[2:24:10] marriage.
[2:24:12] Is that right?
[2:24:14] This is to show you you are going to
[2:24:16] have struggles with this. Even after
[2:24:18] you're married, you're going to have
[2:24:19] struggles with this because you have to
[2:24:22] control that thing. It's not his
[2:24:24] permissive will. You are in a permissive
[2:24:26] will state. As long as you are in this
[2:24:28] permissible will state, you are going to
[2:24:30] keep having troubles with that and you
[2:24:32] have to get it under control. There's
[2:24:34] only one way and that's by taking his
[2:24:36] perfect will which comes by his word.
[2:24:40] You can only do it by being committed to
[2:24:43] him. No other way. and saints, whatever
[2:24:49] situation you found yourself in,
[2:24:50] fornication or whatever, when you come
[2:24:52] to God, here is the promise of God. You
[2:24:56] consecrate yourself
[2:24:58] still. You have not wiped away the
[2:25:00] stains of your past. Then he gives you
[2:25:03] the Holy Ghost
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; that wipes it away.
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; That cleanses it. That's the only thing
[2:25:10] that does.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. In closing, true
[2:25:16] righteousness. How many wants to know
[2:25:18] what's true righteousness?
[2:25:21] Hey,
[2:25:23] this is the part you're not ready for.
[2:25:26] Religious message people.
[2:25:29] Believe us. Thou this. When a Notice
[2:25:32] what kind of man Are you all awake?
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; I'm almost finished. I know it's been
[2:25:37] long, but I'm almost done. Notice what
[2:25:40] kind of man he came to now. A man that
[2:25:42] was righteous. There it is. This is
[2:25:44] something you write down, print it, put
[2:25:46] it in a frame, stick it on your wall.
[2:25:50] I said, do it.
[2:25:53] A righteous man is not a sinless man,
[2:25:57] but a man that depends on his
[2:25:59] righteousness by confessing his wrongs
[2:26:02] to God.
[2:26:06] &gt;&gt; That's a real righteous man. A righteous
[2:26:09] man like Caiaphas who knew he did
[2:26:12] everything right would slap the face of
[2:26:15] the Savior.
[2:26:17] But a righteous man is not a sinless man
[2:26:21] but a man that depends on his
[2:26:23] righteousness by confessing his wrong
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; to God. I'll give you another one.
[2:26:30] Brother Abraham says this many times.
[2:26:32] God provided way. Now a righteous man is
[2:26:35] not a sinless man. For you notice he
[2:26:37] said Elijah was a man subject to like
[2:26:40] passions as we are. He had his ups and
[2:26:43] downs and his differences and the
[2:26:46] scripture of his life proves that he had
[2:26:48] ups and downs like we do. And he had his
[2:26:50] times of wondering and his times that
[2:26:52] his temper got away from him. Like that
[2:26:54] that person who said, "If I still have
[2:26:57] the Holy Ghost, why do I still have
[2:26:58] anger?"
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:27:01] uh he he had a lot of things that went
[2:27:03] wrong, but he was still a righteous man
[2:27:06] because he confessed his unworthiness
[2:27:09] and believed in God. That's what made
[2:27:12] him righteous.
[2:27:14] &gt;&gt; So, here's the problem. We got a whole
[2:27:16] lot of people who don't confess it.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; We're not righteous within ourselves.
[2:27:23] We're righteous through Christ Jesus. I
[2:27:26] cannot be sanctified within myself. I am
[2:27:28] sanctified through Christ Jesus in the
[2:27:30] presence of God in my place. Lastly,
[2:27:33] saints, brother Maram says in the
[2:27:35] message, invisible union. You're
[2:27:37] standing completely. You never sinned at
[2:27:40] the first place. God don't even know it.
[2:27:42] It's in the sea of forgetfulness. You
[2:27:44] never did it. You were accused of it by
[2:27:47] the accuser. But really, from the
[2:27:49] beginning, you were predestinated to be
[2:27:51] a son and daughter of God. You're
[2:27:53] standing there washed. Your old book of
[2:27:54] divorcement is put away and it's dead.
[2:27:57] absolutely out of existence. Even the
[2:27:59] mind of God,
[2:28:03] you're the virtuous bride of Christ,
[2:28:05] washed in the blood of Christ, precious,
[2:28:07] virtuous, sinless son of God, standing
[2:28:08] with a pure, unadulterated, bride word
[2:28:11] that he washed by the water of his word.
[2:28:14] Saints, this is what I believe.
[2:28:17] It's this that I apply to all believers.
[2:28:21] as a pastor of a church and other people
[2:28:24] that I that I preach to, I apply this to
[2:28:27] you.
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; I believe this. Which is why my purpose
[2:28:35] is not to tell you to be liberal. My
[2:28:38] purpose is not to say, "It's okay, young
[2:28:40] people. Go live irresponsibly, do bad
[2:28:43] things, it's okay. Just come back here
[2:28:45] and say you're sorry, and I'm okay with
[2:28:47] it." If you know me, you know that's not
[2:28:49] what I do.
[2:28:50] I believe in accountability. I believe
[2:28:53] in responsibility.
[2:28:55] But I also believe that you're our
[2:28:57] human. You make mistakes. I will deal
[2:29:00] with you. In other words, if you make
[2:29:03] mistakes, it doesn't matter to me how
[2:29:04] many times you fail or fall. If you love
[2:29:08] God's word, I can deal with you.
[2:29:11] That's it. That's it for me because
[2:29:13] that's what I believe.
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; He said to me, he chose you. He wiped it
[2:29:19] away. It's an asserious forgetfulness.
[2:29:21] Even if I don't forget, I still believe
[2:29:23] he he forgot it.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; He's sealed it. He's put it away. That's
[2:29:28] how I work. That's as a minister how I'm
[2:29:32] going to treat you. But you have to be
[2:29:34] responsible
[2:29:36] to him. You have to be responsible for
[2:29:38] me. I have to be responsible for you.
[2:29:41] I'm never going to lose that, right? For
[2:29:44] you.
[2:29:46] There's another thing that annoys me. Or
[2:29:49] rather, let's put it this way. There is
[2:29:52] nothing that annoys me more than a
[2:29:55] believer who lives irresponsibly.
[2:29:58] It annoys me. But trust me, when I meet
[2:30:00] you, I put that annoyance aside.
[2:30:03] But you, if you ask my wife, she'll know
[2:30:07] I'm saying here they go again.
[2:30:11] Why? Firstly, it's inconvenient.
[2:30:15] Why must I deal with this again and
[2:30:18] again and again? It's inconvenient. It's
[2:30:20] annoying. I'm human. I'm like, you know,
[2:30:24] wake up. Start living right, man. Do the
[2:30:27] right thing.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; Speak right. Live right. What's the
[2:30:30] problem with you? I'm striving every
[2:30:32] day. Do it for me, too.
[2:30:35] But if you do fail, I'm going to put
[2:30:37] that annoyance aside. I'm going to work
[2:30:39] with you in my own pride and my own
[2:30:43] self-righteousness.
[2:30:44] I would close my book on you. You mess
[2:30:48] around many times, I will close my book
[2:30:50] on you and walk away from you and leave
[2:30:52] you for a lost cause. I'm I'm confessing
[2:30:55] to you right now, it's only the Holy
[2:30:57] Ghost in me that makes me work with you.
[2:31:03] I get frustrated with myself. Why
[2:31:05] shouldn't I get frustrated with you?
[2:31:10] I don't like unrighteousness at all.
[2:31:12] That's why they call me grumpy at home.
[2:31:15] I'm bound to you by the Holy Spirit in
[2:31:18] all of us. I believe in this. I believe
[2:31:22] the Holy Spirit is in all of us. I'm
[2:31:24] bound to you because of that. I'm bound
[2:31:26] to you by the Holy Spirit in all of us
[2:31:28] to bear your burden and you to bear my
[2:31:31] burden. And I love you as you do for me.
[2:31:35] I'm also duty bound to tell you the
[2:31:37] truth and give you the hope of the
[2:31:39] spirit that keeps calling you back to
[2:31:42] him to make your life right.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Do you love him, saints? I know you love
[2:31:48] him.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; I'm here to tell you, you need to change
[2:31:52] your idea about what the Holy Ghost does
[2:31:54] for you and what a consecrated life is.
[2:31:58] You're not called here to have a
[2:32:01] spiritual epiphany that makes your life
[2:32:04] perfect.
[2:32:06] No,
[2:32:07] there's there's never been a day where
[2:32:10] God gave his son a promise and the son
[2:32:13] just sat back and waited for something
[2:32:14] to happen. This is what bothers me about
[2:32:17] message people today. You've made your
[2:32:20] lives about church.
[2:32:23] Noah was given the word and 120 years he
[2:32:27] built an ark.
[2:32:30] Are you with me?
[2:32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; What do we do? Come to church.
[2:32:35] Is that it?
[2:32:39] That's not even onetenth of it.
[2:32:41] [Music]
[2:32:44] So this is the problem young people.
[2:32:47] This is the problem. This is the problem
[2:32:49] with the message. This is a problem with
[2:32:51] message churches. You come to the
[2:32:54] message, you get baptized, you come, you
[2:32:56] sing song specials, that's it. You do
[2:33:00] nothing.
[2:33:02] Nobody testifies anymore. Nobody
[2:33:04] witnesses. You meet the same people
[2:33:07] traveling with you in taxis to
[2:33:09] university, to college. You do not tell
[2:33:11] them about your faith. You do not talk
[2:33:13] about God. You do not tell them how much
[2:33:15] you love him. You don't testify to
[2:33:17] people you meet, people you work with.
[2:33:19] They know nothing. They think you like
[2:33:21] them and their life. What's wrong with
[2:33:24] you?
[2:33:26] How is that consecrated to him?
[2:33:31] It's not funny to joke filthy jokes with
[2:33:34] your friends. It's not funny to listen
[2:33:36] to somebody showing you some video of
[2:33:39] some filthy jokes on Tik Tok or YouTube
[2:33:42] and then you all laugh at it. That's not
[2:33:44] consecration. Don't think you're going
[2:33:46] to have that life. Come into church and
[2:33:48] expect the Holy Ghost to make your life
[2:33:50] better. This requires consecration.
[2:33:54] This life requires consecration.
[2:33:57] And you can only be consecration if you
[2:33:59] have met the person. If you are not
[2:34:01] consecrated, the simple evidence is you
[2:34:03] haven't yet met the person. You've heard
[2:34:05] of him.
[2:34:07] You haven't met him. You haven't
[2:34:09] esteemed his word greater to you than
[2:34:12] anything else.
[2:34:14] I can tell you this day to me if
[2:34:17] everything fails me, if my wife fails
[2:34:19] me, my children fail me, the world fails
[2:34:21] me, my family fails me, I will never
[2:34:24] leave this word. I believe in it more
[2:34:26] than anything else, more than myself.
[2:34:31] That's what I want to give to you. Let's
[2:34:34] not use this message as an excuse to
[2:34:37] make our lives better.
[2:34:40] If you do, it will make your life
[2:34:42] better. Some of you are living better
[2:34:44] lives because of it. You can live better
[2:34:47] because you are righteous. There are
[2:34:49] people out there who live better because
[2:34:51] they are righteous. Look at Donald
[2:34:53] Trump. The guy doesn't drink, smoke, or
[2:34:56] take drugs.
[2:34:58] Got a mouth like a sailor.
[2:35:01] But I mean, you you talking about a guy
[2:35:04] who's a billionaire, owns stuff, hotels
[2:35:07] and casinos and all over the world, but
[2:35:10] doesn't drink, doesn't smoke?
[2:35:13] doesn't take drugs. How does he have the
[2:35:15] control and go to parties and go with
[2:35:17] people? Because he knows what's more
[2:35:19] important to him.
[2:35:21] He doesn't want to lose control. He's
[2:35:24] living in a world where the moment you
[2:35:25] lose control, people take pictures,
[2:35:27] videos, and stuff and post it about him
[2:35:29] and and break his purpose. He's got a
[2:35:31] purpose. He's got an agenda. He doesn't
[2:35:33] need the Holy Ghost to stay away from
[2:35:35] those things.
[2:35:37] Be consecrated.
[2:35:39] Sanctification is a beautiful thing.
[2:35:42] Consecration is a beautiful thing. You
[2:35:44] have a gift, consecrated to God. Watch
[2:35:47] the anointing. You're a musician,
[2:35:49] consecrated to God. Watch the anointing.
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; When you're consecrated, you sing a
[2:35:54] song, you sing in church. If you're good
[2:35:56] at singing, consecrated to him. Watch
[2:35:59] the anointing.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; The anointing comes with consecration
[2:36:04] because that gift is given to him. If
[2:36:07] you're if you're a preacher, consecrate
[2:36:10] your mouth to him. Consecrate your voice
[2:36:14] to him, your mind to him.
[2:36:17] Don't mix it with man's theology.
[2:36:19] Consecrated with the message, with the
[2:36:21] Bible, with the scripture.
[2:36:24] Watch the anointing. Study. Consecration
[2:36:27] is study. If you're a preacher, study
[2:36:29] the word. Then watch the anointing when
[2:36:31] you speak. You think the anointing comes
[2:36:33] purely because God has put some
[2:36:34] supernatural in us. No. There's work
[2:36:37] involved.
[2:36:41] Amen. That's what it's going to take.
[2:36:43] Consecration.
[2:36:45] Let's bow our heads together.
