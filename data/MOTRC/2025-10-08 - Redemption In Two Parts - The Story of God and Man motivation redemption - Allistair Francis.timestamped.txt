[0:00] So redemption comes in two parts. Next
[0:02] slide, brothers.
[0:04] Part one is the first coming of Christ,
[0:08] the son of man to bring the Holy Ghost
[0:10] to the human vessel. Now, I could talk
[0:14] years on this. We're going to try and
[0:16] make this preede really sort of uh um um
[0:21] shorten it so that we can understand it
[0:23] quickly. Right? So because of what Adam
[0:26] lost, he now has that king theophony has
[0:30] to become man
[0:33] born through a woman
[0:36] and still be Adam,
[0:40] &gt;&gt; right? So man had to be redeemed and
[0:44] that is Christ, the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:46] Brothers, you can put the next slide up.
[0:50] Brother Bram's the words on the side is
[0:51] brother Bram's words. So God became man
[0:54] that man might become God.
[0:57] That's a direct quote from the message.
[0:59] God became man so that man could become
[1:02] God.
[1:04] Why? Because man was God in the
[1:06] beginning. Lost his first estate. Came
[1:10] to this beastly nature. Has been living
[1:12] in this way for 4,000 years. And to
[1:16] bring him back full redemption, he
[1:19] becomes the Lord Jesus Christ. That's
[1:21] the purpose for Jesus Christ, right? So,
[1:24] the first step is we need redemption. We
[1:27] need a man like the first Adam to bring
[1:30] back something to get us to believe.
[1:32] Because for 4,000 years, we've been
[1:34] believing all sorts of trash. We made up
[1:37] cultures and religions and languages and
[1:40] and cave drawings and drawings of
[1:43] deities and all kinds of superstitions
[1:45] about stars and flowers and plants and
[1:48] animals. And we were worshiping the
[1:49] creation instead of the creator.
[1:52] And he now the creator himself has to
[1:54] come down and become us. This is what's
[1:57] amazing. So that logos
[2:00] that came out of the fountain of life
[2:02] becomes a man. Don't you love him
[2:05] saints?
[2:06] &gt;&gt; Born of the flesh but also through
[2:08] spoken word.
[2:11] He was spoken word in the womb of Mary
[2:13] that created that born through the
[2:15] woman. Right. King Theophony himself
[2:18] that we saw who was filled with all
[2:21] those attributes became flesh
[2:24] &gt;&gt; and walked among us being born of woman.
[2:27] He was Emmanuel God with us.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; He was Adonai. He was I am with us. He
[2:34] became flesh. He subjected himself to
[2:37] time from eternity. Paused everything.
[2:40] Came down into time and existed for a
[2:43] short while with us in time. King
[2:45] Theophony himself became flesh. It's not
[2:48] just one attribute that became Adam.
[2:50] This is all of those attributes. And the
[2:53] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[2:56] And we beheld his glory.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. What did he have in him? This is
[3:02] the this is the secret. Like Adam in the
[3:05] first time, in him were two sections of
[3:08] attributes, masculine and feminine.
[3:10] Amen. Let's read in the message Jehovah
[3:13] Gyra.
[3:15] So he created man out of the dust of the
[3:17] earth, not in his image. But when God
[3:19] came down in the form of man by Jesus
[3:21] Christ to redeem that the man that fell
[3:24] from the image of the earth, he was made
[3:26] in the image of the earth.
[3:29] He made himself a body. First he made
[3:31] himself in King Theophony in the in the
[3:34] form of man that was coming in the
[3:36] future. Now he makes himself in a
[3:39] fleshly body
[3:40] &gt;&gt; of earth.
[3:44] There is no limit to God's love for us.
[3:47] There is no limit to his there's no uh
[3:51] place he cannot reach. And and we know
[3:54] he he doesn't even stop there. After
[3:56] Calvary, he goes right down into hell.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; His purpose was to take away man's guilt
[4:02] of sin and bring something new to man.
[4:06] Something new which never occurred
[4:08] before. the Holy Ghost in a new way to
[4:13] bring restoration.
[4:16] What has to happen is like Adam, right?
[4:19] Let's go to the next slide.
[4:21] There he's on Calvary.
[4:24] He died. Brother man said when they cut
[4:26] his side, it was symbolic of water,
[4:28] blood, and spirit which constitutes a
[4:31] birth. He said that's where the church
[4:33] was born.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; What's the church? the feminine
[4:38] attribute. The same way Adam was laid to
[4:40] rest and took out of his side the
[4:42] feminine attribute to produce the female
[4:45] of his connection of his being. He takes
[4:48] out the feminine attribute and the sewer
[4:50] goes forth to sew seeds. The Holy Ghost
[4:52] goes out to bring forth the feminist
[4:54] attribute over 2,000 years of church
[4:57] ages. The same fountain of seven colors.
[4:59] Those attributes from those seven colors
[5:02] is draw. Human beings are drawing from
[5:04] the divine nature. Add to your faith,
[5:07] virtue, virtue of knowledge, temperance,
[5:09] patience, godliness. Add to it the seven
[5:12] colors, the natures of man that were
[5:14] taken from him when he fell. He now
[5:16] sends us the dispensation of the Holy
[5:19] Ghost to bring forth spoken word. That
[5:23] is necessary. And how is he sending his
[5:25] spoken word? Seven stars in his right
[5:28] hand. seven angels.
[5:31] &gt;&gt; Angels were purposed to bring the word.
[5:34] He could see they were going to be
[5:35] necessary, right? And then we said when
[5:38] he when he does this, man is born again
[5:42] of the word and theophony body begins to
[5:45] grow in heaven. You are here on earth in
[5:47] a fallen form, right? But because you
[5:51] believe in the word that he sent because
[5:52] of Calvary, because of the Holy Ghost,
[5:55] because of the token, because the blood
[5:56] was broken, because the life was coming
[5:58] out and the word was coming out in
[6:01] spoken word form, you now receive that.
[6:03] You receive a new birth and theophony
[6:05] begins to grow in heaven.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; We read this last week. While the
[6:09] spiritual birth is growing in your heart
[6:11] of God, there is a physical or celestial
[6:13] body growing to receive your spirit.
[6:16] When the life leaves this body, it goes
[6:18] to that body. Glory to God. Which brings
[6:21] us to part two of the redemption
[6:24] process. The first part was the first
[6:26] coming. What is the second coming? Amen.
[6:30] So the second coming of the son of man
[6:33] to unite the word body and the human
[6:35] vessel.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:37] &gt;&gt; The human vessel had been living in sin.
[6:40] He brought the Holy Ghost to bring the
[6:43] human body, the the sinful vessel back
[6:46] to being filled with the feminist
[6:48] nature.
[6:49] building up the church. He gave himself
[6:52] for the church that he might present her
[6:55] to himself without blame, without
[6:58] blemish, without spot, without wrinkle.
[7:01] The first coming, he died so that the
[7:03] feminist attribute could be manifested
[7:06] on this earth again. But the second
[7:08] coming is to unite the masculine and
[7:11] feminine.
[7:12] Then bringing the unity that's bringing
[7:15] the completion of Genesis 5:1 that in
[7:18] the beginning he created them male and
[7:20] female created the ye them and called
[7:22] their name Adam. Redemption comes in two
[7:25] parts the first coming the second
[7:26] coming. Calvary and in this time he
[7:29] brings back the masculine attribute.
[7:32] Amen. Amen.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; The masculine attribute of the logos
[7:36] returns to earth as king theophony and
[7:40] makes him. So his first coming brought
[7:43] the feminist attribute.
[7:46] The second coming brings the masculine
[7:48] which is why it is the coming of Christ
[7:50] and he does it through the son of man.
[7:52] He's now in this day vindicating the
[7:55] masculine word
[7:58] that would cap the feminine
[8:00] &gt;&gt; that has been manifest. The feminine has
[8:02] been manifest through the ages. She
[8:04] operated as the church. There was signs,
[8:06] wonders, there was healing. There was uh
[8:08] prophecies. There was discernment. There
[8:10] was the word being preached by the seven
[8:12] angels. There were all kinds of things
[8:14] related to the church. There was
[8:16] baptisms. There was communion. There was
[8:18] washing of feet. There was all kinds of
[8:20] ordinances. They were all feminist
[8:22] attributes. There was worship towards
[8:24] him. But yet you still were not
[8:26] connected with him.
[8:28] He sent you a witness, the Holy Ghost,
[8:31] to make those attributes, that feminine
[8:33] attribute become alive in you, waiting
[8:36] for the time that the masculine
[8:37] attribute should return in the message
[8:39] proving his word.
[8:42] Um,
[8:44] oh, before we get there, this is what
[8:46] this is.
[8:48] This is what 963 February 28th is.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; It is the masculine attribute returning.
[8:55] It is king Theophony the capstone the
[8:57] the scientist said made itself visible
[9:01] for 28 minutes
[9:04] which is about the space of half an hour
[9:06] which is the seventh seal the first fold
[9:08] of the seventh seal. He made himself
[9:11] visible for what? For a prophet on earth
[9:14] to know that is a vindication that the
[9:17] seventh seal is to be opened.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; What is the seventh seal all about? The
[9:23] seventh seal brings him back to earth.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:29] &gt;&gt; We don't need him to come back to earth
[9:31] like 2,000 years ago cuz there's no need
[9:34] to bring the feminist attribute him in
[9:36] the form of flesh. He now is to come as
[9:38] king theophony to cap the fleshly body
[9:41] that is on earth.
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Proving his word. Do you see what I
[9:45] mean? It's son of man Jesus Christ will
[9:49] come down in human flesh among us and
[9:51] will make his word so real it unite the
[9:53] church and him as one. So what the
[9:56] masculine attribute would come down and
[9:58] show himself united with a prophet on
[10:02] earth to reveal the word of himself.
[10:07] That's what son of man ministry is. And
[10:10] then she'll go home to the wedding
[10:11] supper. She's already united. We go to
[10:13] the wedding supper all self all the
[10:15] flesh of mighty men cause the marriage
[10:17] of the lamb has come but the rapture is
[10:19] going to the wedding supper when the
[10:20] word here there it is unites with the
[10:23] person
[10:25] they two become one and then what does
[10:29] it do then it manifests the son of man
[10:31] again not the church theologians the son
[10:34] of man which means who is the bride the
[10:37] bride is going to be the full
[10:38] manifestation of the son of man
[10:41] &gt;&gt; the bride will be the revealing of the
[10:43] son of man. Brother Benam was only the
[10:45] first fruits of that. This would be
[10:48] today the full redemption of man coming
[10:51] back to the original purpose. This
[10:53] coming is before the translation.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; This coming is before what you call the
[10:58] rapture, the transfiguration, the change
[11:01] of bodies from this state that we were
[11:03] lost in to the state that has been
[11:05] restored to us. Which means the coming
[11:08] we ought to have been looking for is the
[11:10] word himself, not Jesus Christ from
[11:13] 2,000 years ago.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; See, because we believe he came and
[11:18] released the feminine attribute, and
[11:20] we're waiting to be united with the
[11:22] masculine. That's what we're looking
[11:24] for.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; The coming of this full word will do two
[11:27] things. It will reveal the gene seed in
[11:30] you, the nature of the person you are
[11:32] meant to be. And number two, it will
[11:34] unite the theophony with the human
[11:36] vessel.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Because who does he come with in the
[11:39] seventh seal? Your theophonyies.
[11:43] &gt;&gt; He makes that dimension real to you.
[11:47] Have you heard from your theophony yet?
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:50] &gt;&gt; This will bring on the rapture which is
[11:52] the process of taking you into
[11:54] translation. How does this happen? Why
[11:56] does this happen? What is the gene seed
[11:59] attribute? The father. What is
[12:00] theophony? The word. What is the human
[12:03] being? The vessel. And it all comes
[12:06] together. The Godhead living in the
[12:09] vessel.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; When the vessel by free will today
[12:12] believes the word and accepts it, the
[12:14] father, the word unite, making it God
[12:18] again.
[12:19] &gt;&gt; But the vessel is not the perfect
[12:21] vessel. You say, being conceived of
[12:23] sexual desire, it will dissolve.
[12:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. When this house of this tabernacle
[12:28] be dissolved, that means there's a
[12:31] promise that the vessel will become new
[12:33] for the millennium, not born of a woman,
[12:36] but spoken into existence by King
[12:38] Theophony again.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It doesn't have to fly off
[12:42] somewhere. It's dissolved. That means it
[12:45] remains in the state of theophony
[12:47] waiting for the millennium where the
[12:49] body then is spoken into existence and
[12:51] you receive glorified condition. Saints,
[12:55] here's a quote from the oneness of God.
[12:58] Now, don't you see the great picture?
[13:01] We in flesh are different. We're like a
[13:04] byproduct of a created being by holy
[13:06] wedlock, but in spirit, we are sons and
[13:09] daughters, not some other spirit, but
[13:10] the spirit of the living God. We are in
[13:12] his likeness, in unity, in the perfect
[13:14] image of the living God. Because we
[13:16] become sons and daughters, not separated
[13:19] by the same spirit, the same God, the
[13:21] same person, joined in wedlock to the
[13:24] eternal.
[13:25] See how God planed that we should not
[13:28] be, we should be not a different but
[13:31] him.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; Not some other being of some other
[13:34] tribe, but a real union, an offspring of
[13:37] the almighty done by a holy union. Now
[13:41] the body comes from mother and father,
[13:43] but the spirit come from God. God
[13:46] separating himself as Adam was
[13:49] separated.
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[13:55] &gt;&gt; That's the word of the message.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; Nominal Christianity does not give you
[14:00] that. Amen.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; There is no other ideology or thought on
[14:04] this earth that tells you you can be
[14:07] worthy to be the final manifestation of
[14:10] God and that you are not required to be
[14:13] some blind worshipper, some bow downer.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; You are supposed to be him in the
[14:20] character that he meant for you to be.
[14:23] &gt;&gt; So who is man? He was made to be the
[14:28] last unfolding of God. the last
[14:30] expressed attributes of the revelation
[14:32] of who God is. He is the vessel in which
[14:35] God can be properly known within time.
[14:39] &gt;&gt; Not angels,
[14:41] &gt;&gt; not lions, not elephants, not anything
[14:43] else. Man is the vessel through which
[14:45] God and all these attributes can be
[14:48] known. And each one of you is a
[14:51] different attribute.
