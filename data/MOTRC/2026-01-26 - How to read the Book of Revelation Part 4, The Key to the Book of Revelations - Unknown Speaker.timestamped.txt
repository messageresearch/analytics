[0:00] Greetings precious saints in the
[0:02] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:03] It is the 6th of April 2022 and we're on
[0:07] our series how to read the book of
[0:09] Revelation. This is part three and we're
[0:11] going to call it the key to the book of
[0:13] Revelations. And our scripture reading
[0:15] is going to be taken from Revelations 1
[0:19] verse 5 to8.
[0:21] And the Bible reads like this. And from
[0:23] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[0:25] and the first begotten of the dead and
[0:27] the prince of the kings of the earth.
[0:29] unto him that loved us and washed us
[0:31] from our sins in his own blood, and hath
[0:34] made us kings and priests unto God and
[0:37] his father. To him be glory and dominion
[0:40] forever and ever. Amen. Behold, he
[0:44] cometh with clouds, and every eye shall
[0:46] see him, and they also which pierced
[0:48] him. And all kindreds of the earth shall
[0:51] wail because of him. Even so, amen. I am
[0:56] Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
[0:58] ending, sayeth the Lord, which is and
[1:01] which was and which is to come, the
[1:04] Almighty.
[1:06] The Lord add a blessing to his word.
[1:07] Now, last week we ended with the first
[1:10] phrase of verse 5, which was Jesus
[1:13] Christ, the wonderful name of our Lord
[1:16] and Savior. And what a blessed uh
[1:18] revelation that was to know what Jesus
[1:21] Christ really means in symbol form as
[1:24] much as uh he was a person a man who was
[1:30] on the earth 2,000 and more years ago.
[1:35] But to us it is so much more than just a
[1:38] historical figure.
[1:41] So we stopped at that one phrase and
[1:44] from Jesus Christ we stopped there last
[1:46] week and today we will continue from
[1:49] there. Now when we read these four
[1:51] verses something stands out as so
[1:54] significant.
[1:56] John who is the scribe or the writer of
[1:58] this book seems to make uh big a big
[2:03] deal out of expressing Christ's
[2:05] character and his importance to us. Now
[2:08] we know as we said before that this book
[2:10] is not the revelation of the person of
[2:12] Jesus Christ so much as it is the
[2:15] revealing of things to come as a result
[2:18] of the introduction of Jesus Christ into
[2:22] the world.
[2:23] However, what is significant from John's
[2:26] introduction is that you cannot believe
[2:29] you cannot even begin to believe you
[2:32] cannot even believe what is in this
[2:34] book. So if you don't really have the
[2:36] right revelation of Jesus Christ, you
[2:39] cannot even understand or believe the
[2:42] things that are in the book of
[2:43] revelations. Right? So that's what's
[2:46] important about what we are going to be
[2:49] talking about today. So having the right
[2:52] revelation of Christ is not a once- off
[2:55] thing or some extraordinary experience
[2:59] that comes over you. It's a matter of
[3:01] recognizing him when he presents himself
[3:04] to you or before you in whichever way it
[3:08] is. If it's the preaching of the word,
[3:09] if it's um somebody coming to speak to
[3:12] you about something or in whichever way
[3:15] that he chooses to reveal himself, if
[3:17] it's got to be a particular um
[3:20] understanding or revelation being given
[3:23] in a particular season or another
[3:26] revelation being given in another
[3:28] season. Um, and if it's, you know, an
[3:31] understanding of a certain doctrine 20
[3:34] years ago and this and a and a different
[3:36] understanding of the same doctrine 20
[3:39] years later, however, he is revealing
[3:42] himself to you. You can only grasp what
[3:46] is going on if you have the right
[3:48] revelation of Jesus Christ. And that is
[3:51] what is important. So having the right
[3:54] revelation of Christ is not a once-off
[3:56] thing, right? It's a matter of
[3:58] recognizing him whenever he presents
[4:02] himself to you. So we do not and cannot
[4:05] recognize Christ in any day or age by
[4:09] our own intellect or gift. I think
[4:11] that's a very important thing for people
[4:13] to understand. You can read about him in
[4:15] your histories. You can read about him
[4:18] in the Bible. You can sing songs about
[4:20] him. But you cannot rec that's not going
[4:23] to help you recognize the word for your
[4:25] day. It only takes God within us that
[4:28] can do that for us. It's got to be a
[4:30] deep calling and a deep responding,
[4:32] right? So, how does it happen to us?
[4:36] That's the the main focus of this. It's
[4:39] really quite simple. We'll soon find out
[4:42] that find out that you have to be
[4:44] meditating on him through the word for
[4:48] your day. You get it? So the way to get
[4:52] the revelations that are in this book is
[4:56] to be meditating in the word for your
[4:59] day. So that's what I believe happens
[5:01] here in these next four verses. Christ
[5:04] inspires John to call to the reader
[5:06] remembrance specific characteristics of
[5:09] Christ because it would be important for
[5:12] us to meditate on these things in order
[5:14] for us to receive these revelations. So
[5:17] I I guess what I'm trying to say to you
[5:18] is knowing this that you need to be
[5:22] meditating on something particular to
[5:25] get the revelations of the book. Christ
[5:28] here in the salutation
[5:30] inspires John to bring to the
[5:32] remembrance of the reader certain
[5:34] characteristics which will open up your
[5:36] eyes to the revelations that need to
[5:39] come through. Amen. So let's like we did
[5:42] before get to the breakdown.
[5:45] All right. So the breakdown of these
[5:47] four verses verse 5 to 8 and it's as
[5:50] follows. So in verse 5 we find there are
[5:53] two parts. A it is introducing the
[5:56] author of the book with three specific
[5:58] characteristics of the author's uh uh
[6:02] nature and B he begins to identify the
[6:06] plan of salvation.
[6:08] In verse six he identifies the crown of
[6:11] salvation meaning the end of it. And in
[6:14] and the second part is identifying
[6:17] Christ's rulership. In verse 7, there's
[6:20] the prophecy of the mysterious second
[6:22] coming to all groups and that there will
[6:24] be a late realization for those who
[6:26] didn't see the mysteries of the book.
[6:29] And lastly in verse 8 we find the
[6:32] swearing of the oath of the truth of the
[6:36] statements stating the name and
[6:38] confirming the prophecy by a strong
[6:42] proclamation of his titles and
[6:45] attributes. All right. So you may not
[6:47] understand all of it right away but as
[6:49] we get through it you will understand.
[6:51] So let's get to the second phrase in
[6:53] verse 5 which is the faithful witness.
[6:57] the faithful witness. Now there is a
[7:00] very powerful meaning to this term
[7:03] faithful witness and it is twofold. That
[7:05] means there are two parts to it. If we
[7:07] look at that phrase there is the word
[7:09] witness there is the word faithful right
[7:12] and even with the word witness there are
[7:15] two parts to that just on its own. Now
[7:17] to us when you hear the word witness
[7:20] today you usually think of someone who
[7:21] witnessed an accident or witnessed a
[7:23] crime and has to come before the court
[7:25] and say what they saw. So to us a
[7:28] witness is simply one who has been who
[7:31] has seen something and has a testimony.
[7:34] But in this case the original word in
[7:37] this bible is martus in the Greek which
[7:41] is m a r t u s and that means mart. So
[7:46] for those of you who don't know what a
[7:48] martyr is, a martyr is someone who dies
[7:51] for a cause or he is killed by somebody
[7:56] for what he believes in. And what that
[7:59] actually does is by killing him, they
[8:01] don't realize they make his message
[8:03] stronger.
[8:04] So in this case, the faithful martyr,
[8:09] right? That's what it's saying. And that
[8:11] means his testimony was made most
[8:15] powerful because he had to die for it.
[8:18] Right? The word faithful is added to it.
[8:22] So was not just a martyr but he's a
[8:24] faithful martyr. And what does that
[8:26] mean? Having added faithful meaning he
[8:29] knew he was going to die and still
[8:32] stayed the course. Right? So a witness
[8:35] is one who knows and has seen something.
[8:38] Right? But this witness also knew he was
[8:40] going to die and stayed the course. Now
[8:43] the same John who's the revelator says
[8:46] this of Christ in his gospel. John
[8:49] chapter 1 18.
[8:52] No man hath seen God at any time. The
[8:55] only begotten son which is in the bosom
[8:59] of the father he hath declared him. So
[9:03] what this is saying is nobody has had
[9:06] any firsthand witness of the existence
[9:09] of God and the knowledge of his divine
[9:12] nature besides the Lord Jesus Christ. He
[9:16] is the only one that declared God. The
[9:20] only one that understood the divine
[9:22] nature, right? He's the only He's the
[9:25] firstand witness of the existence of
[9:27] God. The only one with the knowledge,
[9:30] the true knowledge of his divine nature,
[9:33] right? By declaring God, he means he he
[9:37] manifested him. You cannot manifest
[9:40] something unless you know what it is. So
[9:43] notice John says this. He says this
[9:47] knowing that there was Moses who had a
[9:50] great testimony. You know Moses
[9:51] testimony, right? where uh God put him
[9:54] in the cliff of a rock and let him see
[9:57] uh the glory of God going by him. Moses
[10:00] was a man who the Lord spoke to lip to
[10:03] ear, mouth to mouth in a sense of the
[10:06] the what the the Bible says which and
[10:09] then the Bible also says there was never
[10:10] a man that that God spoke to like Moses.
[10:15] And then it also says that there would
[10:17] never be a man with whom God would share
[10:21] such a close personal relationship with.
[10:25] Right? So here we find he declares that
[10:28] Christ's testimony, John declares that
[10:32] Christ's testimony far surpassed Moses
[10:35] or any other prophet.
[10:38] That's really saying something, right?
[10:40] So he was the only one with the intimate
[10:44] true knowledge of the divine nature of
[10:47] God who is the only one who is the
[10:49] authority on who the father really is
[10:51] and what the works of the father is what
[10:54] the word is. He's the only one who is
[10:58] the true and perfect witness and that is
[11:01] what the Bible is saying there in the
[11:03] book of revelations. All right so let's
[11:05] get to the next phrase which is the
[11:07] first begotten of the dead. Now first
[11:10] begotten is often used as implying that
[11:13] something is the firstborn. So if you if
[11:16] you heard someone in you know reading
[11:17] the Bible saying this one was the first
[11:19] begotten of Adam or the first begotten
[11:21] of Abraham or something like that you
[11:24] would say he was the first born. However
[11:27] begotten is not the same as born. Right?
[11:30] There's a reason why we've got to be
[11:32] specific about this. Something that is
[11:34] begotten is eventually born once it has
[11:38] come to its fullness. Right? So he
[11:41] wasn't the first one to beat death.
[11:44] Right? Enoch did. Elijah did. And Moses
[11:48] did. Moses cheated death somehow. What
[11:51] about in Christ's ministry? There was
[11:53] Lazarus. Lazarus was resurrected before
[11:56] Christ's resurrection. Okay, you can
[11:59] say, well, Christ said Lazarus was only
[12:02] sleeping. But his sisters testified that
[12:05] the man was dead. They said, "It's been
[12:07] 4 days. Surely by now he stinkketh." And
[12:10] Christ said, "Well, he's just asleep."
[12:12] Right? But the truth is Lazarus was dead
[12:15] and he was resurrected from the dead
[12:18] into that same body. Now, the scriptures
[12:20] imply that many of the dead saints were
[12:22] resurrected the moment Christ died on
[12:26] the cross. So, what we're saying is it's
[12:28] not that he was the first one who was
[12:31] resurrected. In a sense, there were
[12:32] others who were brought back to life.
[12:34] These others who beat death or cheated
[12:37] death like Moses or experienced being
[12:40] resurrected from the dead, that was all
[12:43] good and well. But what made Christ the
[12:46] first of his kind was none of these
[12:49] others were able to do this of
[12:51] themselves. None of them were able to
[12:54] raise themselves and transfigure and
[12:56] translate themselves. Right? That's
[12:59] what's most important about this. So
[13:02] what it really implies is that he was
[13:05] the first that was brought into
[13:07] existence from death into eternal life.
[13:11] Right? So he was the only one who said
[13:13] destroy this temple and in 3 days I will
[13:15] raise it up again. Why are these details
[13:19] why are the details of this so
[13:20] important? Because he is calling for you
[13:24] to meditate on these things. That means
[13:27] you've got to take notice of this,
[13:29] right? Why? It will lift you into a
[13:32] higher plane to receive the revelations,
[13:34] which means he's asking for things like
[13:36] knowing what his death was all about.
[13:39] He's asking for you to know what Calvary
[13:41] was really about. He's asking for you to
[13:43] know what the resurrection really was
[13:45] about. For if you don't know these
[13:48] things, you're not going to understand
[13:50] the revelations of this book. All right?
[13:53] So also first begotten implies something
[13:57] beautiful. If he was the first begotten
[14:00] it it indicates that there will be more
[14:03] that will be gotten. Romans 8:29 says
[14:06] for whom he did forno he also did
[14:09] predestinate to be conformed to the
[14:11] image of his son that he that is Christ
[14:15] might be the firstborn among many
[14:18] brethren.
[14:19] Glory to God. So that means there will
[14:22] there was a promise of others to come
[14:25] that would be like him. Amen. That would
[14:29] be that would have the ability to raise
[14:32] themselves to raise to the next
[14:35] dimension,
[14:37] right? To to receive the word in them in
[14:40] its fullness and to transfigure
[14:42] themselves and translate themselves by
[14:45] the word that they believe. Glory to
[14:47] God. So let's go to the next phrase
[14:49] which is the prince of the kings of the
[14:52] earth. Now again the details are
[14:54] important here. It might make you wonder
[14:56] why Christ is called a prince while
[15:00] heathen and pagan men are called kings.
[15:03] I mean why couldn't it have why couldn't
[15:05] the Bible just have called him the king
[15:07] of the princes of the earth? Why prince
[15:10] of the kings of the earth? Right? Isn't
[15:12] a king greater than a prince? Are you
[15:14] getting it? So you can see that many
[15:17] ways to interpret this. There are many
[15:19] ways to interpret this and all are wrong
[15:21] except the right one. So you know you
[15:24] could say well in a sense prince means
[15:25] ruler so it means that he was the ruler
[15:28] of the kings. Well if that be so that
[15:31] means if he's the ruler of the kings of
[15:32] the earth that means that whatever the
[15:35] kings are doing are under his rulership.
[15:37] So therefore they're not really sinful
[15:39] or doing anything against his will.
[15:42] Obviously that is the wrong revelation.
[15:44] So what is the meaning of prince of the
[15:47] kings of the earth? What is the right
[15:48] meaning? Amen. So you can see that there
[15:53] are many ways to interpret it. A prince
[15:57] is many things but mainly a prince is
[16:00] the successor to the throne or he's the
[16:05] next in line. So this is the context
[16:07] that he wants us to see here. Right? The
[16:10] book of Revelation is going to show us
[16:13] the downfall of the kings and the
[16:16] dominion of Christ as king of all the
[16:19] earth which takes place after the
[16:21] Armageddon. This is so beautiful saints
[16:24] because this simple phrase the prince of
[16:27] the kings of the earth is actually
[16:29] telling us that Christ is the successor
[16:32] that there are kings there are
[16:34] presidents there are governments there
[16:36] are so many uh rulers of this earth but
[16:40] they're all going to fall away and he is
[16:42] the one that is next in line to take
[16:45] control of everything. Revelation 11:15
[16:49] tells us, "And the seventh angel
[16:51] sounded, that is the Armageddon. And
[16:53] there were great voices in heaven,
[16:55] saying, the kingdoms of this world are
[16:58] become the kingdoms of our Lord and of
[17:01] his Christ, and he shall reign forever
[17:04] and ever." So there you have it. Glory
[17:07] to God. I just love the scripture. The
[17:09] next phrase is him that loved us. This
[17:12] is not just expressing human emotion. It
[17:15] was never ever about human emotion. Love
[17:18] is much more than what we make it out to
[17:20] be. A mother's love for a child is not
[17:22] about emotion. It often manifests itself
[17:26] with emotion, but it is truly about the
[17:29] unbreakable physical and psychological
[17:32] bond that she shares with her child.
[17:35] Right? So when the Bible says him that
[17:39] loved us is speaking about the bond he
[17:43] created with us. Now how did he create a
[17:45] bond? So there's like a love between a
[17:47] mother and a child. There is love
[17:49] between a husband and a wife. What is
[17:51] the love that is created between or the
[17:55] love that Christ created with us? What
[17:58] is this referring to? It's simply this.
[18:01] He became one of us. That is love to be
[18:06] united with us. Now now hold on to this
[18:09] right.
[18:11] Love is not the emotion. When we say he
[18:13] became one of us, it's not talking about
[18:16] the emotion. It's talking about the
[18:18] bond. Remember when we say to someone I
[18:22] love you. Most people think of the
[18:25] feeling. They express the feeling. Now
[18:28] feelings come and go, right? How can it
[18:31] be love if if one moment you feel
[18:33] intense attraction to someone and the
[18:35] next absolute hate? How was that love?
[18:40] How can you feel intense
[18:43] uh liking for someone and then if they
[18:46] do something then you're suddenly
[18:47] irritated and you don't like them at
[18:49] all? That's not love. Love is union
[18:53] between two things. Love is uh peace and
[18:58] harmony that is existing between two
[19:01] things, two people, two entities. Right?
[19:04] So love could be described as magnetism,
[19:08] two attributes in perfect harmony,
[19:10] right? Just the same way. So he became
[19:13] one of us. He's united with us when we
[19:16] could never have been united with him of
[19:19] our own free will. If you take in in the
[19:22] the scripture Colossians 1 21-22,
[19:26] the Bible says, "And you that was
[19:28] sometime alienated and enemies in your
[19:31] mind by wicked works, yet now hath he
[19:34] reconciled." It means he's brought you
[19:37] back. How did he reconcile you? Verse
[19:40] 22, in the body of his flesh through
[19:44] death to present you holy and
[19:48] unblameable and unreprovable in his
[19:52] sight. Glory to God. So in other words,
[19:55] by becoming the flesh, right, he was the
[19:59] mystery of God revealed. His very flesh
[20:03] was the uniting of the nature of man and
[20:06] the divine nature of God. It was true
[20:09] love expressed. There is nothing in this
[20:12] world that can express that kind of love
[20:16] because that bond can never be broken.
[20:19] You can, you know, people can stress
[20:21] their love to one another today and the
[20:22] next thing they're divorced. They're
[20:24] married, then they're divorced. That's
[20:26] not true love, right? Love cannot be
[20:29] broken. It's a bond that is that exists
[20:31] forever. That that true love is a bond
[20:33] that exists forever. True love is true
[20:35] unity. the strongest bond that can ever
[20:38] exist. When it says him that loved us,
[20:44] amen, it is him coming down leaving the
[20:49] dimension that he existed in to become
[20:51] our dimension so that we could be bonded
[20:55] with him. Amen. Then there's the phrase
[20:59] washed us from our sins in his own
[21:02] blood. This means this is referring to
[21:06] his selfless act of sacrifice that is
[21:08] Calvary obviously right now what did
[21:12] that do miraculously removed the shame
[21:15] and guilt of sin from our lives now I
[21:19] want you to think about this uh because
[21:22] brotherham says in one of the quotes in
[21:25] the messages I can't remember exactly
[21:27] but I have read it to you several times
[21:30] he says God doesn't save you because you
[21:32] felt felt sad or because you felt more
[21:36] sad than someone else and that's why
[21:39] he's he saves you because you felt
[21:42] guilty for your sin and sad that he died
[21:44] on the cross and uh he took away your
[21:47] sins and therefore because you you felt
[21:50] sad and you were crying therefore you
[21:52] are saved. He said God doesn't run his
[21:56] business haphazardly. That's not how it
[21:58] works. Right? So what did Calvary
[22:01] actually do for you? If you're someone
[22:03] who actually believed in Calvary,
[22:06] someone who who literally believes in
[22:10] Calvary, how does it miraculously remove
[22:12] the shame and guilt and sin from our
[22:14] lives? Right? So, it's not it's not that
[22:17] you felt sad, therefore you were, right?
[22:21] Actually, it removes shame and guilt.
[22:26] You should not be feeling shame and
[22:28] guilt uh because of Calvary. You should
[22:32] be feeling victory. Amen. So his
[22:36] sacrifice
[22:38] washing us is a cleansing. It doesn't
[22:41] remove the remembrance of our wrongs.
[22:43] Right? You're always going to remember
[22:45] what you did. And other people are
[22:47] always going to remember what you did.
[22:49] Some of them will even remind you. Now
[22:51] think about that. any other person
[22:54] remembering the thing that he did that
[22:56] caused him guilt and shame and
[22:57] embarrassment and so on and other people
[23:00] reminding you of it, you're you're going
[23:02] to hold on to it. It's going to stick to
[23:04] you like a scar. It's going to be
[23:06] something that you're that that you're
[23:08] going to scratch at. It's going to itch
[23:10] like a scar. But what he's done for us,
[23:15] washing us from our sins, means it
[23:18] literally releases us from the hold that
[23:21] sin had on us. That shame and that guilt
[23:24] that held us down, that kept us prisoner
[23:29] um he by his own blood. That indicates
[23:33] it was not the blood of any man. His own
[23:36] blood. If he was God, it means it was
[23:39] the blood of God that washed us from our
[23:43] sins. Such a beautiful uh understanding
[23:46] to be had there. Amen. I hope it becomes
[23:49] a reality to us. The next phrase is made
[23:52] us kings and priests unto God and his
[23:56] father. Now, this is beautiful. I could
[23:58] take very long with this because you
[24:02] know in here is many things about the
[24:04] godhead and so on but we'll get into it
[24:07] in in greater detail on kings and
[24:09] priests in revelations 5 than I'm sure
[24:12] but this indicates another very
[24:14] important thing to meditate on going
[24:17] forward in this book something very
[24:19] important for us to understand that will
[24:22] unlock the other mysteries of the book
[24:24] so making us kings and priests obviously
[24:27] is the end result of the salvation of
[24:30] the lamb of God. Right? So he he um
[24:33] comes down, he loves us, that means he
[24:36] becomes one of us. He washes us from
[24:39] guilt and shame from from the our sins
[24:42] with his own life, his own blood. And
[24:45] then lastly, he makes us kings and
[24:48] priests. So what is kings and priests,
[24:50] right? And not just kings and priests,
[24:52] but kings and priests unto God and his
[24:54] father. So kings means rulers. Rulers of
[24:58] a domain. Rulers have a dominion. Rulers
[25:02] have subjects. So in whichever facet of
[25:05] life we belong to, he makes us leaders
[25:08] of that life. We are leaders of life.
[25:11] And yet you know that most leaders of
[25:14] life are corrupt because pride sets in.
[25:18] So to add to that, not only making us
[25:20] leaders of life, he makes us
[25:22] intercessors. What is an intercessor? It
[25:25] is one who is touched by the feeling of
[25:27] people. Right? He he is so not just a
[25:31] leader of life. You're an intercessor
[25:32] for people. It is the order of
[25:34] Melkisedc. It is the perfect balance of
[25:37] rulership. It is the right to rule but
[25:40] having the balance of intercession.
[25:43] Amen. And so that makes that makes all
[25:46] the difference. That's if any true ruler
[25:49] if he acted not just as a king but also
[25:52] as a priest then he would have the
[25:54] balance of rulership whether he was a
[25:57] president or a king or a prince or a
[26:02] princess or a queen or whatever they are
[26:04] to have the balance of intercession
[26:07] makes all the difference that's the
[26:09] order of MelkiseDC so now unto God we
[26:12] are made kings and priests unto God that
[26:14] means we are commissioned to those
[26:16] position conditions of authority by the
[26:19] divine nature himself. That is by God
[26:21] himself. Amen. Unto God and his father.
[26:26] Right? So that's not two people not unto
[26:28] God and his father. That means God is
[26:30] his father indicates that the literal
[26:33] body of Christ issued forth from the
[26:36] spirit of God. It means there was no
[26:39] other father of Jesus Christ of the body
[26:42] of Jesus Christ other than God himself.
[26:46] God is that father. And what is father?
[26:49] Father means the place of origin. Where
[26:51] it comes from, where it issued from.
[26:54] Father means one who produces seed and
[26:57] determines its purpose. So every detail
[27:00] of the existence and the purpose of
[27:02] Christ, the body he came into, the woman
[27:05] that was chosen for uh the birth, the
[27:09] the the
[27:11] life that would be lived, the purpose it
[27:13] would hold, the end result of it at
[27:16] Calvary, the resurrection, the church,
[27:19] and all that that exists thereafter in
[27:23] time originated in God himself. Thus
[27:27] telling us that God himself was the
[27:30] father of all that is Christ. Amen.
[27:34] Don't limit this to two people in a
[27:36] trinity. Come on. It's much greater than
[27:39] that. God being a father, he had seed.
[27:43] He had life in himself and he had the
[27:46] ability to produce that life and give it
[27:49] purpose. And with Christ, he issued from
[27:54] God. He had no other father. There is no
[27:57] other origin. Amen. And amen. Then comes
[28:01] the worship.
[28:03] The word says to him be glory and
[28:06] dominion forever and ever. Amen. So you
[28:10] see right we we um notice in the
[28:13] beginning of this scripture you see the
[28:16] the um expression of John of who Christ
[28:20] is. It says Jesus Christ the faithful
[28:23] witness, the first begotten of the dead,
[28:25] the prince of the kings of the earth. He
[28:27] unto him. So you can see the worship
[28:29] begins there. Unto him that loved us and
[28:32] washed us from our sin in his own blood,
[28:34] made us kings and priests unto God and
[28:36] his father. To him be glory. And so this
[28:39] is this verse is about worship to
[28:42] Christ. It's about giving Christ the
[28:44] glory. It's about giving him the honor
[28:47] that he is the one to whom our
[28:50] allegiance lies. To to him be glory and
[28:53] dominion forever and ever. Those words
[28:56] mean to him that is to Christ be glory
[28:59] and dominion means we recognize his
[29:01] authority and his sole rulership. No one
[29:05] else. We do not bow down to anyone else.
[29:09] Amen. Forever and ever means throughout
[29:11] the ages of time. Wherever time exists,
[29:14] he will be the one that we will bow down
[29:16] to. You know, symbolically meaning the
[29:19] one who we accept, we believe is our
[29:23] leader. He is our lord and master. And
[29:27] we accept that his word is is final.
[29:31] Amen. And that saying, the next verse,
[29:35] the next phrase is amen. What is amen?
[29:38] Amen is those this beautiful word that
[29:41] we keep saying whenever we hear the word
[29:43] and agree with it. But amen means so be
[29:46] it. The other way of saying it or the
[29:49] other way of saying what it means is
[29:51] this. This is the absolute truth. When
[29:55] you say amen, what you mean is this is
[29:58] the absolute truth. All right? So it
[30:02] punctuated what was said before with an
[30:05] amen. John punctuated it with an amen.
[30:09] So the next phrases from the next verses
[30:12] shows us the prophecy of the mysteries
[30:15] of the second coming. Now remember the
[30:18] second coming is a mystery of many
[30:20] manifestations. I hope you understand
[30:22] that right? So when you see Matthew 24
[30:25] and you hear of the the prophecy of the
[30:27] second coming and you see it in Luke
[30:29] 17:30 and the other verses and many
[30:32] other places where Christ speaks of it,
[30:34] some places that Paul speaks of it, some
[30:36] places that Peter speaks of it, they are
[30:38] all speaking of the second coming. But
[30:40] the second coming falls under the
[30:42] seventh seal and the seventh trumpet
[30:45] with with which you know people really
[30:47] don't know which one goes where and
[30:50] which manifestation goes where. It is
[30:52] all the second coming of the Lord. They
[30:54] all have different manifestations.
[30:57] You've got to figure out which
[30:58] manifestation is required in your day or
[31:01] actually takes place in your day. There
[31:04] is a second coming to take his bride.
[31:06] Then there is a second coming to Israel
[31:08] under the seventh trumpet where he
[31:10] returns to earth with his bride. And the
[31:12] same is his coming to judge uh coming to
[31:16] earth to judge man where he comes with
[31:18] the theophanes of the saints. Right? So
[31:20] we'll talk about that just now. Then the
[31:22] coming of the Lord to the earth where
[31:25] all of the earth recognize him to judge
[31:27] the mark of the beast and to judge
[31:30] death, hell, and the grave. So all the
[31:32] mysteries of the second coming are in
[31:36] the many words that we find in the
[31:38] prophecies, but you have to see which
[31:41] one is for your day. So in this
[31:44] particular phrase he starts with this
[31:47] prophecy. Behold he cometh with clouds.
[31:50] Clouds plural. Now we know the prophet
[31:52] speaks about this in the church ages.
[31:54] And he says this cloud plural where
[31:57] every eye shall see him. Remember we
[31:58] read the quotes. This means it is not
[32:01] the rapture because the rapture is a
[32:04] secret. You remember all the quotes. He
[32:06] says this means this is this coming with
[32:08] clouds is the third coming. right now.
[32:12] Obviously, you'll never see a scripture
[32:15] in the Bible saying there is a third
[32:17] coming. So, obviously what he's saying
[32:19] is of course this is part of the second
[32:22] coming, right? But this is the second
[32:25] coming as seen by a different group of
[32:28] people. It is the second coming to that
[32:30] group of people. So, let me give you an
[32:32] example. If you say to someone, let's
[32:35] say I'm I'm from Durban
[32:38] and I'm in Durban. Let's say I'm coming
[32:40] to Newcastle and I say to the people
[32:42] there uh on well I don't know maybe May
[32:46] the 1st will will be my first coming and
[32:49] then on May uh somewhere else in the in
[32:53] the month of May will be my second
[32:55] coming. So if I uh come on the 1st of
[32:59] May that's my first no problem. And then
[33:02] I don't give them an exact time or date
[33:04] in the the rest of of May. And then I
[33:07] come secretly and I meet some people and
[33:10] then I meet some other people and then I
[33:13] spend like a whole two weeks there and
[33:15] then I meet other people and then I go
[33:17] away back to Derban and then I come back
[33:20] again at the end of May and meet some
[33:22] other people. So whoever I met to them
[33:27] it is my second coming. if they all met
[33:29] me on the 1st of May and saw my first
[33:31] coming and then they saw me at different
[33:33] times but in actual fact there were
[33:36] three times that I came to Newcastle
[33:39] right that's kind of like what goes on
[33:41] here so whether so that person the one
[33:45] who saw me at the end of May will say no
[33:47] but his second coming was on the end of
[33:49] May the other one would say no he was in
[33:52] the third week of May and the other one
[33:54] will say no he was in the second week of
[33:55] May but they're all speaking of my
[33:57] second coming to them personally and
[34:00] that's what this is about. So remember
[34:03] that. So when he says the clouds plural
[34:06] is the third coming, it's off it's the
[34:08] coming after the rapture when he comes
[34:11] uh with his saints and so on, right? So
[34:14] that is obviously a coming to a
[34:17] different group of people and also with
[34:19] a group of people. So we'll see that
[34:23] right? So behold, he cometh with clouds,
[34:26] plural. Now clouds means a great cloud
[34:30] of witnesses. In other words,
[34:33] theophanes, not sitting on a literal
[34:37] cloud that brings rain, right? It's
[34:39] theophanes of the saints whereby we are
[34:42] encompassed with a great cloud of
[34:44] witnesses. Theophanes of the saints
[34:46] returning with him for the millennium.
[34:48] Different prophets saw different ways.
[34:50] Enoch spoke about coming with 10
[34:52] thousands of his saints. Others said he
[34:54] will be coming with white horses. Some
[34:57] said he'd be coming with clouds. They
[34:59] saw whatever they saw in vision, white
[35:02] charges, which means horses and so on.
[35:05] Right? But it is interpreted theophanes
[35:09] of the saints returning with him for the
[35:11] millennium.
[35:12] And the next phrase, every eye shall see
[35:15] him. That means every soul will know and
[35:20] recognize and acknowledge that he is
[35:25] God. Glory to God. Amen. Every eye shall
[35:29] see him. That see him means to know him
[35:33] means to recognize, means to
[35:34] acknowledge, means to have some
[35:36] revelation of him. Right? And then the
[35:39] next phrase says, "And they also which
[35:41] pierced him." Now, who pierced him?
[35:43] Right? You say the Romans. No, that's
[35:45] not what it refers to. When they say who
[35:47] those who pierced him, it means those
[35:48] who led to his crucifixion. Those like
[35:52] Joseph's brothers who gave him the scars
[35:54] that he had, the Jews under the seventh
[35:58] trumpet, right? That's who this is
[36:00] referring to. Remember when he was
[36:03] crucified, they said, "Let his blood be
[36:05] upon us and upon our children." So these
[36:08] Jews under the seven trumpet, that's who
[36:11] it's referring to. They are the ones who
[36:13] will recognize him
[36:15] and not only pierced him 2,000 years
[36:18] ago, but for a very long time saying
[36:20] he's not the Messiah, saying he was a
[36:22] fraud, Jesus Christ was a liar and the
[36:25] Christians are wrong. The Jews uphold
[36:28] that that belief and that is piercing
[36:31] him, right? But under the seventh
[36:32] trumpet, when they see him come, they
[36:35] shall know who he is. So every eye shall
[36:40] see him. That means everyone shall
[36:42] recognize him and it outlines especially
[36:45] those who uh pierced him and the next
[36:49] phrase all the kindreds of the earth
[36:52] shall wail because of him. So that is
[36:55] the Gentiles who refuse the grace of his
[36:58] word in their day. They shall whail. All
[37:02] right? Whale means they will realize
[37:04] their mistake and they will be judged
[37:06] with regret for their decisions in life.
[37:11] Amen. All kindreds of the earth shall
[37:13] wail. So that's referring to the
[37:14] Gentiles. Okay. So we move to the
[37:18] the next part which is swearing the oath
[37:22] that the prophecy is truth. Right? So
[37:26] you see here just one phrase even so
[37:29] amen. Now in the first part we saw uh
[37:33] him giving praise to him and then it
[37:35] ended with amen was punctuation amen.
[37:37] But here it says even so amen. This may
[37:40] look like it just indicates the ending
[37:43] of the salutation. You know like signing
[37:45] off a letter but it was more than that.
[37:47] In the old days they had a tradition of
[37:49] making an important statement be uh they
[37:53] they they wanted the statement if it was
[37:56] important enough to be double impacted
[37:57] by a show of authority. Even so, amen is
[38:02] like a strong shout saying it shall be
[38:05] done according to the way it was
[38:07] expressed. Right? That's not just saying
[38:10] amen. Even so, amen. That means it is
[38:12] saying whatever was described in that
[38:14] salutation is going to be it shall come
[38:17] to pass. Making it double sure. Right?
[38:21] Now, saying that in the old days they
[38:24] would do so. But this would accompany
[38:27] something called a confirmation of
[38:30] authority. That means having said even
[38:33] so, amen, something has to follow. And
[38:36] what follows is the repetition of some
[38:39] of the of the authorities's name. And
[38:42] that's what we see in the last few
[38:44] phrases. I am alpha and omega.
[38:49] You know, this on its own is a
[38:53] wow. It's a it's um a series. We could
[38:56] preach a series on alpha and omega,
[38:59] right? But what is I am alpha and omega?
[39:02] It is a great proclaiming proclamation
[39:06] of authority.
[39:08] In other words, you went through this
[39:09] whole thing where he said John to the
[39:11] churches in Asia and this and that and
[39:13] and from he which was and is and and
[39:17] from the from uh the seven spirits
[39:20] before the throne and from Jesus Christ
[39:22] who did this and who did this and who
[39:24] did this and blessed you know uh glory
[39:28] and honor dominion be unto him and so on
[39:31] and then it ends with you know he will
[39:34] come you know and he will um every eye
[39:38] shall see him and so on and it ends with
[39:41] I am like it's like out of this out of
[39:43] the blue I am alpha and omega like
[39:44] what's he doing why is he saying this
[39:47] you and I would be looking at this
[39:48] phrase in the Bible and thinking well
[39:50] you know we following him so far and
[39:53] then suddenly he he just says it okay so
[39:56] let me give you an example let's say I
[39:57] send you a letter
[40:00] and uh today and I write to you and I
[40:02] say you know uh brother sister so and so
[40:05] uh here's an important message that I
[40:07] have for you and this is going to happen
[40:09] and that's going to happen and you need
[40:10] to do this for me and this uh this you
[40:12] need to do that and I've gotten on good
[40:16] authority that such and such is going to
[40:18] happen and I am ordering you to do this
[40:21] so that we save something here and there
[40:23] and then I end the letter with I am
[40:25] Alistister Francis of Durban and so on
[40:27] and so on you people would think I'm
[40:29] crazy because nobody does that anymore
[40:32] what does it mean I am alpha and omega
[40:35] Uh what does it mean to to to state your
[40:38] name like a shout of authority?
[40:41] See nowadays we sign a signature.
[40:45] We have we put in our to make things
[40:47] double short to convince people that we
[40:49] are serious. we sign our signature and
[40:51] we put in our ID number, you know, and
[40:55] um other other ways of of putting a
[40:58] stamp on it so that you know or we can
[41:01] go to a commission of oats and stamp it
[41:03] and uh claim that this document is true
[41:06] or something like that and so on. But in
[41:09] the old days, they had to have a
[41:11] confirmation of authority. And so it
[41:15] could only be someone with authority
[41:16] that makes that confirmation. And so
[41:19] here was John writing to the churches in
[41:23] Asia on behalf of himself and on behalf
[41:26] of Christ. And then while John is
[41:30] writing suddenly it breaks out into I am
[41:33] alpha and omega. So this is not John
[41:34] saying I am alpha and omega. First we
[41:37] were talking about Christ and then
[41:38] suddenly it breaks out into alpha and
[41:40] omega. I am alpha. So this is basically
[41:46] while Christ is inspiring John to write
[41:49] certain things and John is writing then
[41:52] suddenly
[41:54] uh it's like John is speaking for
[41:57] Christ. I am alpha and omega. What is
[41:59] that doing? It is the proclamation of
[42:02] authority. It is a name being stated
[42:06] showing absolute assurance of a fact or
[42:09] situation. In other words, he's saying,
[42:12] listen, I am the end all and be all or
[42:15] be all and end all of it all. I am the
[42:17] greatest, the highest authority on a
[42:19] situation. But that's not even what he's
[42:21] saying. That is saying, I am confirming.
[42:24] I Jesus Christ am confirming that
[42:26] whatever John told was true. Right? And
[42:30] then, as if that wasn't enough, he then
[42:32] says it in English. You know, alpha and
[42:34] omega is Greek. In English, he says the
[42:37] beginning and the ending. It is saying
[42:39] the same thing in a different way.
[42:41] Repeating the same statement is giving
[42:42] it double significance. It was important
[42:45] in those days to do such things to
[42:47] indicate how severely significant the
[42:49] writing um the letter or the book was.
[42:54] And then lastly, saith the Lord which is
[42:57] and which was and which is to come the
[42:59] Almighty. Now we dealt with that
[43:02] statement which is which was which is to
[43:05] come. We dealt with it last week. But
[43:08] saith the Lord, then he repeats the
[43:11] statement we found earlier in the
[43:12] salutation which is which is which was
[43:15] that we read before the revelation. What
[43:17] is that? It is what is which is which
[43:20] was and which is to come. It is the
[43:21] revelation of the word being expressed
[43:23] through time. It is Jesus Christ the
[43:26] same yesterday, today and forever. Yes,
[43:28] we know that. Hebrews 13:8. We dealt
[43:30] with that last week. The only difference
[43:32] here is that he adds the words the
[43:36] Almighty.
[43:39] Wow. In case anyone thought that Christ
[43:42] was a second person in the Godhead,
[43:44] someone less powerful than the father,
[43:46] he identifies himself as almighty.
[43:50] Listen people, Christ
[43:53] identifies himself. I am alpha and
[43:55] omega, the beginning and the ending. The
[43:58] almighty. the Almighty indicating that
[44:02] the flesh manifestation of God as Christ
[44:05] is not just the son. It's not just some
[44:08] second person in the trinity is
[44:11] nonetheless
[44:13] almighty the almighty. The reason we
[44:17] call this section that we have just read
[44:19] the key to the book of revelation is
[44:22] because it is going to take constant
[44:24] remembrance of these particular
[44:26] attributes to unlock all the mysteries
[44:29] of the book. So, I'm just saying it
[44:31] plainly to you,
[44:33] right? Those simple verses we just read,
[44:35] which we call the salutation, ending
[44:38] right here with the Almighty, it's going
[44:41] to take a real revelation of these
[44:44] attributes
[44:46] revealed here in these statements.
[44:48] Because if you know Christ in this way,
[44:51] if you know the prophecies of him in
[44:53] this way, then you will be able to
[44:55] understand what is later going to be
[44:58] revealed in this book of Revelation.
[45:00] Amen. So in conclusion,
[45:03] reading Revelations 15-8 as you read it
[45:07] in your book reads like this. and from
[45:09] Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness
[45:11] and the first begotten of the dead and
[45:13] the prince of the kings of the earth
[45:15] unto him that loved us and washed us
[45:18] from our sins in his own blood and made
[45:21] us kings and priests unto God and his
[45:23] father to him be glory and dominion
[45:26] forever and ever. Amen. Behold, he
[45:29] cometh with clouds, and every eye shall
[45:32] see him, and they also which pierced
[45:34] him, and all kindreds of the earth shall
[45:36] wail because of him. Even so, amen. I am
[45:41] Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the
[45:44] ending, sayeth the Lord, which is, which
[45:46] was, and which is to come, the Almighty.
[45:50] So, our question is how to read the book
[45:53] of Revelation. In this case, this is how
[45:56] it should read with revelation.
[46:00] Revelations 1 verse 5-8
[46:03] and from Jesus, right? So, it should
[46:06] read this. and from the word who was
[46:08] made flesh and dwelt among us who was
[46:11] born of a woman not of the will of man
[46:13] but of the will of God. the only perfect
[46:16] declaration of the person of God who was
[46:20] willing to confirm his testimony by
[46:23] dying willingly and was the first to
[46:26] defeat death while he lived, having the
[46:30] power to raise himself from death into
[46:33] eternal life, and became the only worthy
[46:36] successor of rulers of the earth. unto
[46:39] him who became one of us by his body
[46:44] reconciling us to God and cleansing us
[46:47] from the shame and guilt of unbelief
[46:50] through his selfless sacrifice and made
[46:53] us like himself leaders of life and yet
[46:57] intercessors
[46:59] commissioned by the divine nature which
[47:02] was his very origin. To him we give all
[47:06] the worship recognizing his authority
[47:09] and his rulership and no other. This is
[47:14] the absolute truth. Take heed. He will
[47:18] come again mysteriously with a great
[47:20] company of the saints in theophonic
[47:23] bodies and every soul living and dead
[47:27] will recognize and acknowledge him as
[47:30] God. Even the Jews who rejected his
[47:33] first coming and all Gentiles who
[47:35] rejected him will deeply regret that
[47:38] they made decisions to reject his
[47:40] revelation in their day. Again we say
[47:44] this is the absolute truth.
[47:48] I Jesus Christ hereby declare these
[47:51] statements and prophecies to be the
[47:53] absolute truth confirming it with my
[47:56] name being the highest authority of all
[48:00] things living and dead dimensions seen
[48:03] and unseen being the eternal and
[48:06] unchanging in nature. The same
[48:09] yesterday, today and forever. being
[48:11] almighty God sharing no power with any
[48:15] deity above, beneath or equal to me.
[48:20] Amen. Praise be to God. That is
[48:23] Revelations 1 verse 5 to8. I trust that
[48:27] the word of God was a blessing to you.
[48:29] Have a wonderful evening, saints. May
[48:32] the Lord be with you. Amen. And amen.
