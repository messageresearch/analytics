TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Let's read the word of God. Job 38:1-7. Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, "Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge? G up now thy loins like a man, for I will demand of thee, and answer thee. Where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare if thou hast understanding. Who had laid um the measures thereof? If thou knowest, or who had stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the foundations thereof farened? Or who laid the cornerstone thereof? And we want to take our title and text from verse 7. when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord blessed the reading of his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this morning um we want to we want to speak on um the story of God and man part two and our the theme of it is going to be becoming sons of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. becoming sons of God. This is something that is so casually spoken of. And um I don't think the the weight of what this understanding really is has has grasped people. &gt;&gt; But I think when you when you get through the the opening of the seventh seal, when you understand the opening of the word, then it becomes clearer to us. Amen. So our title is going to be morning stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy. Amen. Morning stars sing together and sons of God shouted for joy. Now the prophet quotes this scripture often to tell the story of a very old African-American preacher who he had heard preaching and he spoke about you know when the prophet was a young minister and he was visiting different churches and he was trying to figure himself out and where it was going to be what it was going to or what his ministry was and he come across this this Pentecostal church and he said um he sees this old um negro little man. He looked like about 18 years old. 80 years old. And he look like he's, you know, walking up to the pulpit and a platform and he looks like there's barely any life left in him. And and and brother Ram is thinking what's going to happen to this guy, you know. And then he reads the scripture and uh and then brother Ram said he he he speaks about Job and then he he goes to eternity. Brother Ram's words. goes to eternity all the way through eternity and takes the horizontal rainbow and comes back to his time to the second coming of the Lord. And then he was so excited. This 80-year-old man was moving up and down and jumping and preaching. Brother Bham quotes his word. He said, "You ain't got enough room in here for me to preach." &gt;&gt; So, and then brother Bam looked at his says, "I want that." So his comments, now if you look at this through the message, morning stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy. Every time you hear this in the message, brother Benam is talking about this situation, right? Most of the time he's talking about that story of that old man preaching. And then his comments begin to evolve in his ministry from that story to people saying well you know this new kind of worship let's you know this message people or the Pentecostal people it's a new kind of worship and brother Bam use that and says no it's not a new kind of worship it's a worship that began before time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh then that evolved and then he spoke about them how they must have shouted for joy when they saw the lamb slain in him before the foundation of the world. And then it went on and he said they uh the shouting religion must have happened when they saw that lamb slain. And then they uh it evolved again and he said they must have seen the savior redeeming mankind. That's why they were rejoicing. when they seen their names put on the book later on in his ministry. They were shouting when they seen the names being put on the book. &gt;&gt; And then in Christ, the mystery of God revealed that beautiful message. He says God had a hidden purpose, a hidden mystery. Uh in his uh and he says in spiritual amnesia, he says I was with him in the immortal realms of God 10 million years before. I was, he said, so I was with him before the beginning. He said, I was with him when he was when he met Abraham. I was with him when he met Jacob. I was with him when he met Joseph. I was with him when he met Moses. I was with him with every Christian. &gt;&gt; You just have amnesia. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he every time those statements were made that I've just mentioned, he quotes the scripture. Morning stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we want to speak on that this morning and bring it back to the story of God and man. And the theme is becoming sons. &gt;&gt; Becoming the sons of God. Amen. So I want to begin with reading some just some quotes to give us a little um beginning. And any man knows that the angel of the covenant was Jesus Christ. That's right. The same yesterday, today, and forever. God unfolded himself. Now, I want you to remember what we spoke on last week. The whole plan of redemption, the whole from from the beginning before the beginning of beginnings, right? From the fountain of life to the logos to creating angels to creating the the the universe to creating man, uh the fall to Christ. Think of everything. remember everything. So remember God unfolded himself. That was God in that pillar of fire. Remember that fountain of seven colors. He unfolded himself down. Now he's moving through time &gt;&gt; into a human body, virgin born. So that fountain of life, that pillar of fire, moving through time, unfolded himself down now to Christ, born of a virgin, right? No man could touch him there in the fountain of seven colors. You could see him here, but he's born of a virgin. He's virgin born. Now he went away. Who's that? The one who was born of a virgin. He went away. A little while the world see me no more. Yet I'll be with you even in you. Same God living right down unfolding himself into the heart of man. got down here when he could shake them are rejoicing like Job did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory. &gt;&gt; They said, "Brother Brandon, that's a new kind of religion." Uh-uh. It's just a new case of the old time. &gt;&gt; Old time. Why? God said, "Uh, ask Job, where was you when I laid the foundation of the world?" When the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy. Watch this. Did I? before the foundation of the world was ever laid. This ain't something new. It's something old. It's the beginning. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's read. The hand of the Lord came upon him. Why I said about God spoke to Job one day and he said, Job, where was you when I laid the foundations of the world? Tell me what they're fostened unto. said, "When the morning stars sang together and sons of God shouted for joy, a hundred million years before the world was ever formed, they had shouting religion." &gt;&gt; Amen. Then talk about something new. Why? It's the oldest there is and the only kind there really is. Yeah. It's oldfashioned heartfelt I love this. It's oldfashioned heartfelt sky blue sinkilling religion. Brother, it don't whitewash you. It washes you white from inside out. &gt;&gt; Yes, it does. Here it is. Makes you do things you didn't think you ever would do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where we are today. Listen, he said in my right mind, in my better thinking or something like that, I would have been a hunter and a fisherman. &gt;&gt; I would not be doing this. But it's I'm paraphrasing it. But he called me to do this. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And I know every single one of you here in your thinking I can't say better thinking in your your thinking you would rather be somewhere else doing something else. It's the word of God to human beings is inconvenient. &gt;&gt; It messes up your plans &gt;&gt; every time. And and you know this because you always have desires to do something and the word of God blocks you &gt;&gt; and you won't do it for the word's sake, not your sake, &gt;&gt; for the word's sake. But you fully know you have the ability, the capability, and the desire to do that. But you won't do it because your heart is sold out to the word. &gt;&gt; And therefore, the word is inconvenient to your desire and your will. &gt;&gt; That's a struggle you have every day. Now, I love these statements that the prophet makes and so many others like in the message I just read too. It really makes my soul soar higher and higher when I get into the word. Now, many years ago, I just want to say this, brother Isaiah Brooks was traveling through South Africa with a minister I had never met before. His name was Brother John Simon. And uh I I obviously um we had we had heard brother Isaiah was coming and you know brother Isaiah pitched up and he had this other minister with him. So we thought brother Isaiah was going to preach and brother Isaiah said no please let brother John preach. So we said okay you know and brother we took him to Peter Marrisburg at that time. It was a Thursday evening and uh I was nervous because this is a church we were helping out and I'm thinking I don't know this brother and but brother Isaiah had you know um said he he should preach. So you know here we go. you have no idea what ministers have to go through and the nervousness, right? And then uh he he he read the scripture, this opening scripture about the sons of God shouting for joy. And um from the opening scripture, he then made or asked the most profound question I had heard and it has never left my mind to this day. In fact, I've quoted it many times. just never said it was from brother John Simon. And um but you know I'd love to give roses while we're living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so when he made this the statement this question it was a question but it was more a statement and uh it made my mind race till till today for many reasons that you that you could not imagine but I hope to express some of it today. He simply asked this. If sons of God shouted for joy when they were in attribute form, why wouldn't they do the same in manifested form? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was his opening question and a statement. And I tell you, I struggled to concentrate for the rest of the service because he had my mind going. &gt;&gt; And the service went on. It was a wonderful service. It was a beautiful service. But what I drove back from Pashburg that night to Durban and then we were talking with them in the car but in my mind it's just cog wheels just working and uh the whole thing was unfolding to me and I my heart is just saying amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If they shouted for joy in attribute form there's a great big thing I need to see here that in manifested form they're not going to be dispersed. &gt;&gt; They're not going to be lost somewhere out in the world. Those attributes are going to find themselves. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're going to be drawn together. &gt;&gt; If they shouted together in attribute form, in manifested form, they've got to do the same. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; So, I want to continue on the story of the story, the subject of the story of God, a man, but I want to draw us into this beautiful scripture from Job 38:1-7. And I like the question brother Vanam asked in spiritual amnesia and u he speaks about the promise uh or or rather the premise of the point. The premise of the point God asking Job was where were you &gt;&gt; speak tell me understanding. Who is this that is darkening counsel with words without understanding? That was the beginning question, right? Like who is who is giving you spiritual amnesia? Who is telling you stuff about me when they've got no knowledge about who I am? &gt;&gt; Who is telling you things about the word, about the message or giving you philosophy about who I am or with words they don't have understanding of? Who is it? Job. Where were you? That's the premise. So I'm asking you, where were you? When the morning stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for joy, &gt;&gt; he says, "You forgot where you came from." Brother Vam says, "Spiritual amnesia." You have spiritual amnesia. All right. So, let's go to the next point. The attributes um then and now, right? So, the first thing is that attributes of God don't just occur by themselves. isolated in time. They're not just acting alone. There's not just a son of God just pitching up somewhere and randomly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; There's no random thing about this. &gt;&gt; There what I'm saying to I want to draw your attention to this. There are always clusters. You remember like how he took a clinker off that original light through it &gt;&gt; and there were clusters that formed a galaxy. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. There are clusters of these attributes and uh they were meant for each time. There were clusters around Martin Luther's time. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there were clusters of attributes that were thrown into that time around John Wesley around Ireneius around there were clusters of attributes they would find themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. and they would gather around the world for their day and they would work together for a common purpose. You would not find clusters attracted to each other and then working against each other. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you're right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not what they did in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So why? Because they have one mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were in his mind. They came from the same cluster of attributes so to speak. Amen. That means there were attributes that came together in Abraham's time. Like you wouldn't have a purpose of Abraham being fulfilled if there wasn't an Elea there. &gt;&gt; If there wasn't a Sarah there. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; You wouldn't Abraham would not be able to fulfill his full potential without Sarah. Without Eleaza. &gt;&gt; Yes. There wouldn't be a a a story of Moses if there was no Joshua. If there was no Aaron, if there was no Zipper. &gt;&gt; There had to be clusters of attributes &gt;&gt; that were of the same mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That were of the same purpose &gt;&gt; to be fulfilled in a time to bring forth a particular purpose in that time. And they would work together with each other like Zipper would challenge that husband and say, "A bloodier husband art thou to me." &gt;&gt; But she saved him. God would have killed him if it weren't for her. &gt;&gt; And that attribute had to be fulfilled to keep that man alive to fulfill the bigger purpose. &gt;&gt; But there are always these clusters. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? So how about this time? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There are a few things we have to consider and this is what's going to happen saints. There are a lot of people who are going to want to be a part of the cluster. We have a purpose. We have one mind and we have something to fulfill. There are people who are going to try to think they can do what we are supposed to do a better way, a different way. But if they work against what God has ordered, &gt;&gt; it isn't going to work. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because we have to be able to shout together for joy. &gt;&gt; So number one, who are the morning stars? Why do they sing? Who are the sons of God? Why do they shout for joy? Now I want I want to tell you something. When you read the Bible and and here's what's happened since Western filled the earth is that everything is like fantasy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Like science fiction. And and when when you hear nominal Christians today when they sing when they talk about the father, they talk about the son, they talk about angels, they sing in the prophetic, &gt;&gt; they pray in the prophetic. I I don't know. Everyone prays in the prophetic. Speak. If you if you meet them, say, "God bless you, brother. How you doing?" And, "Oh, which church you from?" And, "Oh, I'm a I'm I'm a pastor, but I I pray in the prophetic." Oh, okay. That's good for you. Bit risky, but you know, whatever floats your boat. Who are the sons of God? Who are the morning stars? And who are the sons of God? This has been questions that have plagued the minds of people for hundreds of years, right? And and the questions on who are the sons of God. This is you know what I love about mysteries that confuse people is that I know it's meant for me. &gt;&gt; The more trouble there is around it, the more it's meant for me. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So if people were arguing about the sons of God from Genesis saying they were angels and they pressed themselves into human beings and they make up stories and the nephilim and this mated with that creature and this produced this and I know that is meant for me to know and nobody else. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, when they talk about Christ and they talk about the bodies and they talk about the resurrection and they make up stories and they make up uh fantasy about rapture and flying off in the sky and all that's when I know this is meant for me &gt;&gt; because that mystery is going to go on with people forever. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But we are going to break into the reality of it. &gt;&gt; Not afraid of it. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, some have said, brother Miam even speaks about in the message that there are people who said those sons of God are angels. But that isn't consistent with scripture. So, let's begin. Morning stars. First, who are morning stars? You remember this from last week, my terrible drawing. These morning stars are angels. Morning stars is a designation which means angels. The Bible is consistent from Genesis to Revelation that stars when referred to as heavenly beings are angels. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Revelation 1, seven stars in his right hand. Who are they? Angels. Messengers. &gt;&gt; Yes. They were manifested in man but they are angels. Stars are messengers. Right? Jude verse 13 when it refers to the fallen angels. Remember Jude is talking about the fallen angels. He called them wondering stars. Um it's a special designation which means being a messenger, a messenger from God to mankind. And the prophet said you can have heavenly angels and earthly angels. &gt;&gt; They are messengers. The word morning star refers to angels from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sunday school children. What does morning mean? From the beginning. &gt;&gt; Evening time is the end time. The morning time was the beginning time. &gt;&gt; Amen. So these stars, morning stars, are angels from the beginning. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; If you read Isaiah 14 and verse 12, here's an interesting one. How art thou fallen from heaven, oh Lucifer, son of the morning? &gt;&gt; How art thou cut down to the ground? We read this last week. This is why the Jews named him Lucifer. What does Lucifer mean? Lightbringer or morning star Lucifer actually I mean you could actually call the whole group Lucifer. Of course, we don't because now it's evolved into the devil. &gt;&gt; But it simply means lightgiver or morning star, right? So he is old Lucifer, morning star, son of the morning. In other words, angel from the beginning, right? And that's referring to Satan or the devil as we now call him. Of course, those are not names. Satan means adversary. Devil means false accuser. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So there's no reason for us to give him fancy names. Now let's consider what God is asking Job. Okay. Where were you before the beginning of the creation of the earth and the beginning of fleshly man? Tell me if you know. Where were you? So we know the setting is in the first beginning when that logos created the angels. That's the setting. Where were you then? Right? Why did they sing in the beginning? So that's our first two questions. Who were the morning stars? Why do they sing? Okay. So in Job 38:7 when we see uh the word sing, the morning stars sang for joy. That word sang in the Hebrew is raan which means to overcome. &gt;&gt; Now the reason it is that way in the Hebrew is because like today we just sing. &gt;&gt; We sing because we're happy. We sing because it's tradition to sing in church and do song specials and it's entertaining and it sounds nice on the ear. &gt;&gt; But in the Hebrew time, you only sang when a battle was won. &gt;&gt; Singing speaks of victory. &gt;&gt; When the Israelites saw God vanquish the Egyptians in the sea, they came out with temporal singing. The horse and his rider hath me cast into the sea. I will sing to the Lord forever &gt;&gt; because he has cast Pharaoh's riders and chariots into the sea. It was a victory. In Revelations 5, when the lamb took the book, they sang a new song. It was a victory. Why? Because no man was worthy to take the book. &gt;&gt; In Revelations 14, when the 144,000 gained the victory. Revelation 14:1, they sing a song which they hear from heaven which only the 144,000 can learn. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Morning stars sang because they overcame Lucifer and his angels and kicked them out of heaven. &gt;&gt; Why did morning stars sing? It wasn't the angels breaking out into choir. There was a reason. That's why brother Bam kept putting they must have seen something. They must have something must have happened. They must have seen uh the lamb slain before the foundation of the world. They must have seen names being put in the book. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He spoke about them differently, right? They sang and they shouted. One group sang, the other group shouted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So then we get to the sons of God. Now the sons of God is another designation altogether. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now wait, this is where you're going to wake up. Sons of God are not morning stars. &gt;&gt; Sons of God is a special designation. That's why those sons of God in the time of Genesis before the flood were not fallen angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The sons of God, brother Mariam dispels that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Said they are not fallen angels. They were the children of Adam. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That took the sons of Cain. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And produced hybrid through that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. So who are sons of God? They are the children of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So before the flood there was this conjecture that the sons of God took the daughters of men and people thought they were fallen angels but the prophet said they were not. Sons of God are a designation of man. &gt;&gt; In the Hebrew sons of God, son is Ben. God is Elohim. Ben Elohim, sons of God, sons of the self-existing one. Ben Elohim in Hebrew means divine being, divine one or divine judge, &gt;&gt; not angels. Yes, angels might be divine, whatever that means, right? Maybe to you divine means something from heaven that's shiny and glowing. &gt;&gt; I don't think so. Divine wants, divine beings or divine judges. The word Elohim is plural for Eli. Elo, remember that? &gt;&gt; Brother speaks of that. That's in the Hebrew. Elo, right? That's the singular. Elohim is the plural. Elohim actually means gods. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Remember in the commandments uh thou shalt I am the Lord thy God. You shall have no other gods beside me. In the Hebrew that says I am your Elohim. You shall have no other Elohims or Elohim besides me. The same God that is used, the same name Elohim that is used for God is the same name that was used for the idols. &gt;&gt; He said they are false Elohim. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I am Elohim. If it was his name, literal name, how can he call an idol Elohim? It was a Canaanitish word that Abraham learned at the time. Ben Elohim is sons of God, divine ones. But more than anything, they are judges. Remember when the Lord said when when they um came to Christ and they said, "You being a man call yourself God." He said, "What's your problem? Doesn't the scripture say you are gods?" &gt;&gt; What was he asking now? Doesn't the scripture say you are judges? &gt;&gt; What What problem do you have with me saying I am a judge? I am the judge. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; By implication, it would mean that sons of God are the offspring of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that would mean they are the offspring of the divine one. They are divine ones. They are divine beings. They are divine judges. That is the reason they had a problem with Christ calling himself the son of God. Listen people, Christ actually didn't call himself the son of God. He went around saying son of man, son of man. Even when Nathaniel called him son of David, that was Nathaniel's revelation. Christ never went out saying the son of God shall be lifted up. He said the son of man. &gt;&gt; When you see the son of man, he because it was son of man dispensation. But when he called himself son of man, they knew what that meant. &gt;&gt; When he said the son of man, they knew he meant I am Messiah, son of God. It's only today in 2025 that you have a problem because you don't understand the wording of that time. Son of man was son of God the Messiah. &gt;&gt; They understood that. That's why they said you being a man make yourself God. &gt;&gt; All right. So you all got it? &gt;&gt; Angels were not sons. &gt;&gt; Sunday school. Angels were not sons. They were angels. Sons are sons. Angels are angels. Let's understand that. All right, let's read. Remember this fountain of life. There's all the little dots, the little attributes. And brother said, out of him came this logos. King's Theophony. God formed himself into the form of a man. Remember from last week? Because he could see what man was going to be. He made himself into a form relatable to the ones who are going to be. &gt;&gt; He chose the form of a man in theophony. &gt;&gt; That's why theophony looks like man. Why? Because of who you are today. Okay. Anyway, so where were you? Can you see the the clusters coming together into an order in him? &gt;&gt; Yes. When all the attributes were in the fountain, they were just attributes. But when they became the logos, the word king theophony, they became an order to those attributes. &gt;&gt; They came together in their clusters, in their purposes. In him, there was going to be an Abraham. And there were going to be attributes around Abraham. There were going to be a David. There was going to be a Samuel. There was going to be uh an Ezekiel, a Daniel. There was going to be a Paul and a and a Peter and around them were going to be attributes and those attributes were all in him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right. So, here's the quote. All right. That's where sons of God were. Sons of God were there before angels. &gt;&gt; They were there in attribute form. Right? Here's quote. Brother man was praying said and you created angels then you become a god. &gt;&gt; So when did he become God? When there was a creation to worship him. Before that he wasn't God. He was the fountain of life. The self-existing one. I am. I am becoming. Is that right? But when he created angels he become a god an object of worship. And then from there you created man and so forth. Man fell the great attribute of God displays itself tonight as a savior. When you created man, you become a father. &gt;&gt; So when did he become a father? When Adam was created. He's not the father because he's the father of Jesus. He's the father because he's the creator of man. Yes. &gt;&gt; He became the designation of father becomes manifested when man is created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because so who does a father why is a father called a father? Go ahead Sunday school. &gt;&gt; Because he has. &gt;&gt; So why wasn't the father when the angels were created? &gt;&gt; Because the angels were not sons. Yes. &gt;&gt; They were messengers to sons. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He becomes father when he has sons. You cannot be called father unless you have children. Can you imagine married couple and you know how it goes married people you know first you're love darling whatever 20 years later you're dad right your wife calls you dad what's your problem you know I used to be my name now you call me dad I'm not your dad but that's what you become you become Dad, everyone calls you dad, you know, and very much among our our Indian people, you can go to Chhatzsworth, Phoenix, anywhere here in Durban, you meet a stranger, he'll call you dad. Say, "Hey, I'm looking for this road." "Hey, dad, I can help you." father. You can only be father if you have sons. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; If you have children. Amen. When you create a man, you become a father. Praise be to God. He also said in another place, we could never enjoy an angel's life. &gt;&gt; Some of you wish, right? &gt;&gt; You never enjoy an angel's life. He said we wasn't created angels. God created angels, but he created you and I, men and women. &gt;&gt; I'm not making this up, saints. He says this in many different places, in different ways. There's a difference between morning stars and sons of God. Difference between angels and sons of God. So, angels could fall and be lost and thrown into a lake of fire. offspring or sons can be lost and not be thrown into a lake of fire because sons have to be saved because they sons &gt;&gt; they're children. Lucifer and his angels are lost and they will their end is the lake of fire. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You lot backslid and did the worst things and there's no way you can go to the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; You have to be saved &gt;&gt; because you come from him &gt;&gt; because you were in him before before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Sons cannot be lost &gt;&gt; forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Big difference, right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. So this takes us back to the story of Job because all message Bible scholars who just love to be technical have to have their day in court. &gt;&gt; Right? So let's go to Job 1:12. There was a man in the land of Uts in South African English today. I don't know the correct pronunciation is uts right from or the from the chaldes this man his name was Job this this is a story of Job right and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and estued evil and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters Sunday school how many sons &gt;&gt; and how many daughters &gt;&gt; right His substance also was 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 yolk of oxen and 500 she assasses and a very great household. So that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east job. &gt;&gt; Right? Some of you saying I I wish I could be as rich as this man. Trust me, you don't want to be brushing down 500 she asses. and 500 yolk of oxen every day. And his sons went and feasted in their houses and everyone his day and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with him. He's trying to tell us how happy this family was. &gt;&gt; Every son, seven days of the week, each had his day. They all feasted in each other's house on a different day. &gt;&gt; And they each invited their three sisters. What nice brothers. Verse five. And it was so when the days of their feasting was gone about that Job sent and sanctified them and rose up early. Now, this is a real parent. He's not taking for granted, my kids are born in the message. They're baptized. They have the Holy Ghost. They're great. They're good. Let's forget about them. No. He rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." &gt;&gt; This is why God saw him as righteous. &gt;&gt; He didn't take it for granted that his children looked like they were message believers. &gt;&gt; He said they might have cursed God in their hearts. I want to take care of those hearts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse six. Now there was a day when the sons of God. Now there this is where the story actually comes. When the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Whence comest thou?" That means where are you coming from? Then Satan answered the Lord and said, "From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it, so casual, the devil talking to the creator." And the Lord said unto Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job?" Does the father bragging? And there is none like him in the other, a perfect and upright man, one that fearth God and is skeweth evil. Verse 9. And then Satan answered the Lord and said, um, doth Job fear God for not? That means, does he re does he really serve you for no reason? Have you not put an hedge about him? is not because you protect him &gt;&gt; with that message church and that cood &gt;&gt; and those deacons and those pastors and they're watching like hawks and that dress code and their all their laws and rules. Is it just because of that that you're keeping him hedged in and he's safe? Let him one day on university I'll show you who he is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. put him in the workplace. In that place, even in the workplace, you got deacons working with him. Hast thou made an h about him and about his house and about all that he had every on every side. Thou was blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increasing. You've just given him blessings. God doesn't even deserve it. Verse 11, but put forth thy hand now and touch all that he hath and he will curse thee to your to thy face. That means make him uncomfortable. Give him sickness. Give him troubles. Give him financial issues. Give him economic issues. Give him trouble with his house. Break his stuff. He'll curse you. I bet you. Satan talking to the Lord. Can you believe it? So bold devil. And the Lord said unto Satan, "Behold, all that he hath is in thy power." And the Lord is said, the father is saying, "Okay, devil, do what you want. Go for it. Only upon himself, put not forth thine hand." So you can you can touch his children. You can do what you want to his animals, his house, his lands, just his life. You're not allowed to touch his life. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. Now this isn't the first time. When you reach chapter 2, there's another meeting with the same scenario coming. The sons of God come to present themselves and Satan comes trapesing along. Where did you come from? From walking to and from the earth. have a consider myself it's like a repeat thing and and Job won the first battle and the next battle Satan is saying nah you're still helping him so that's the story okay Christian people uh theologians the ones who deserve the day in court they romanticize the story the reason why I'm actually telling you this is because they make it supernatural fantasy and do not see the truth this is not an actual occurrence. &gt;&gt; There is no devil who can just saunter in from the fifth dimension into the seventh dimension say, "Hey, how you guys doing? You know, good to see you again. It's been a few thousand years you guys kicked me out, but I'm back again just to hear what you guys have to say. Hey, big guy. what she's doing. &gt;&gt; This this is this is to me how ridiculous it is that Christians believe this &gt;&gt; that Lucifer just walks into heaven, waltes in and God says, "Hey, how you doing? Where you coming from?" &gt;&gt; Oh, walking to and fro. &gt;&gt; No, saints, this is not an actual occurrence. This is a prophetic utterance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not before the foundation of the world either. Neither is there Satan walking in and when he pleases and just walks before the Lord. No, God doesn't really ask Satan a question like where are you coming from? He's God. He knows where he comes from, where he's going to everything. Why everyone asking that question? &gt;&gt; Because it's a prophetic story. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. This wasn't an event where sons of God literally came to present themselves like um every day of the week, you know, um memo meeting for the board. Sons present yourselves Monday morning going to check up on your agenda and how things have been going. No, sons of God don't come to present themselves before God at certain times. What does it mean? This was just a parable. It was not talking about angels gathering and Satan coming in among the angels. It said sons of God, not stars. &gt;&gt; What this actually means is God was considering his children who are on earth. That's all. Not they were coming to him to present themselves. It didn't happen that on certain Monday morning at 10:00 all the children of God in in the childies decided to offer sacrifice. So they were all presenting themselves in a line and then Satan was walking among them. No, it was simply God considering all his children. Right? When the prophet speaks about it, he doesn't speak as if they were angels. Go read the message. Brother Bam says they were children of God gathering, not angels. Brother Bram says, and this is what's beautiful. This is how we know it's a it's a prophetic parable. Brother uses that to say, tell me where the sons of God are gathered together that Satan isn't in the midst of them. We know Lucifer was kicked out of heaven. We know Lucifer and his angels kept not their first estate. We know there is a sixth dimension of angelic existence and a fifth dimension of Lucifer and his angels, fallen angels. They are two separate existences, two separate dimensions, they do not come together. Are you with us? So, brother says, wherever there are sons of God, Satan is among &gt;&gt; He said it was in Eden. It was among the disciples. It is in every church. Everywhere sons of God are gathered, the enemy comes in among them. Job 38 identifies that they shouted for joy before the foundation of the world. So the reason I read this story to you is because because we took Job 38 and we spoke about that. We spoke about morning stars and sons of God. Then people who are technical and supernatural fantasy kind of people come to verse one and two and say well explain that. &gt;&gt; Well we do right sons of God coming together parable not fantasy not angels not Satan walking in with the angels with God in heaven bragging about Job. It is a prophetic parable saying God looking at his children considering Job and the enemy is basically expressing but you're blessing him. You're you're doing everything for him. You're protecting him. You're making him prosperous. Take away all that he has and let's test him. &gt;&gt; From there, I'd like you to understand God allowed the enemy to afflict his children. He lost all his children. The the order was not him. You can touch everything else. His children died. His wife told him to curse his god and die. Said, "You speak like a foolish woman." Okay, let's go to a story. Now, for those of you, you know, a lot of you, you're you're getting older now. And I mean, when I say older, I mean you're like my age or even younger. and you forget to read them, the really exciting parts of the message. It's good to go back and read those things, &gt;&gt; right? And I know a lot of you are busy with your jobs and your careers and your young people, your studies, but it's so good to read the message and especially those parts that bring you back to your old landmark. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the whole story I told you last week, the story of God and man from before the beginning is actually in the message on adoption. Okay? And uh that's one place where you'll find it. There are other places but that's one place. So I want to start reading there. And this is the fountain of life. Let me so I just want to tell you brother Baron said let me draw you a little illustration here. That means brother Ramy is saying let me draw you a picture. Like I was telling my little boy today I'm speaking on story of men and God part two. He says are there going to be pictures? I said yes and let's go. Okay. They like pictures. So brother Baron says let me draw you a little illustration here. It's good. You know what I like to say? These fellows will go around the world telling stories of brother Brandon. You know testimonies they were there. I don't know why they don't tell us what he drew. They're telling me about somebody's hat and this happened here and somebody got healed and like I want to know what did he draw on the board in adoption part two. &gt;&gt; You were there. Why don't you tell me that? Because I really want to know that. I don't care brother so and so was sitting there and got healed and all of that. That's very nice, but I want to know this drawing. &gt;&gt; Nobody tells me that. Anyway, I believe I talked in a little bit the other night or struck it in Genesis chapter uh 1st chapter 126. When God called his name Lord God, it's in the word of ll Elohim, which means the self-existing one. There's that fountain, self-existing one. There was nothing else existed by him. There was no air. There was no light. There was no stars. There was no world. There was no nothing else. It was God and God alone. Llo him. Now he made that. What did he make? Right? So inside here's everything I told you inside of that was attributes which meant that inside of this great llla Elohim uh was an attribute. You know what an attribute is Sunday school or let me say it like this. The reason why I'm saying Sunday school, it was a nature that's so the little fellow will get it. &gt;&gt; Sunday school and I'm one of the little fellas that has to get it that way. So what is an attribute? An attribute is a nature. &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; Inside of him was the nature to be a father, but he is self-existent. There was then nothing for him to be a father by. And now down inside of that see I told you clusters inside of him was to be a father and inside of the attribute of father there was something else that he was god and that god an object of worship but he was self-existent llohim llohim so there was nothing to worship him inside of that he was savior and there's nothing lost to be saved see inside of that he was a healer And there was nothing sick to be healed and nothing to be sick. Now do you get the picture? So his attributes, his nature produced what is today. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see the story? &gt;&gt; So you know I didn't make it up. Then some people say, "So now from that fountain where all the attributes are in, he becomes the logos and everything that was in him was poured into Christ. That fountain of life that was not known, that was a mystery, that was a complete mystery, could never be called anything, could never be worshiped, could not be seen, now became something that could be seen, something that could be related to, something that could be worshiped, something that could be understood, and it was called the word of God, the logos. Some people say, "Well, why didn't God just stop it in the beginning? He's a cruelhearted brute, said Joe Lewis. The one that condemned Joe or Jack Co said he's just a cruel brute. There's no such a thing as God. If there was such a thing, he'd be a, "Oh, I just call him all kind of name." See, but it's just because he might have a lot of knowledge up here, but he got nothing down here. Now, that's where it's at. See, this word tells it here, and he's hid it. And that's where I want to get to today. These mysteries, these natures, these attributes has been hid. Now remember the Bible said since the foundation of the world waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Those natures, those seeds, those attributes are hid in him and they're only revealed when they are manifested. &gt;&gt; Glory. Those sons of God from the beginning who shouted the the secret of it is hidden until they are manifested in reality form. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God &gt;&gt; to display then to the church. Oh my. You get it? Last quote there. Now I'll stop on my story and he did it. Broke from there went on to something else. I'll stop on my story just a little bit. I'll bring I'll go to my text uh my next thought till I get this. Now remember, all through the ages of Moses, back through the ages of the prophets, back through all ages, they waited until this latter day for these things to be displayed according to the scripture. That's right. For it to be revealed to the sons of God, &gt;&gt; not angels, &gt;&gt; sons of God. So all those attributes, all the mysteries are to be revealed to the sons of God from the lost until like the pyramid. As I've said, building closer, closer, closer. Glory to God. So firstly, saints, it's important for you to know that the story we told you was not made up by me. It was something the prophet expressed in several places. We just put it together in picture form. I'm hoping one day Allah to speak to him and and hear what diagrams he drew. Now what is he talking about? What mysteries were hid? Are we together? &gt;&gt; What mysteries were hid and waiting for the manifestation of sons of God? There were natures of God that were not revealed that were not known. They could not they could never be known through the angels. That's why they required sons. All those natures of father, savior, healer, redeemer, etc. were not revealed because man had to be created and manifested for those natures of God to be revealed. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Amen." Let's go to the fellowship of the mystery. You remember that scripture? Okay. Ephesians 3:9. So here was this logos we spoke about just taking this clinker letting it go and say stop and that formed into a galaxy and that formed into a galaxy and that formed a galaxy started creating the universe. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and verse 9 of Ephesians 3 to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God. So firstly there is a mystery. &gt;&gt; Secondly there is a fellowship of the mystery. &gt;&gt; Thirdly that fellowship of the mystery was hid in God. &gt;&gt; Fourthly from the beginning of the world. Amen. Who created all things by Jesus Christ. This is amazing. &gt;&gt; This is amazing. You have a scripture here that tells you, you know, a people he made all things by Jesus Christ, but Jesus Christ only came 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; How did he then make all things by Jesus Christ? That tells you that Jesus Christ was that logos &gt;&gt; before it was manifested as Jesus Christ. The same way he was theophony, you are theophony. You come to theophony now you bypass the seed that you you came from seed straight to fallen form. Now you have to attain theophony to be like him. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. So Paul was speaking here the fellowship of the mystery from the beginning of the world had been hidden. God prior to this in the verses before he's speaking of himself and his ministry. He's saying that his purpose in his ministry is to show people the fellowship of the mystery. &gt;&gt; See, to make all men see what is. And so his ministry would show and this is what we are here for. Why are you manifested here? In the fact that you are united around the word, you are showing manifesting the fellowship of the mystery that was hid. And the fellowship is not every Sunday. Hey, God bless you. How you doing? Good to see you next Sunday. He's not that's he's not saying the mystery of fellowship. That that's what I think people mess around with. The mystery of fellowship. You know, fellowship is, you know, let's get together, have some tea and cake, and talk about the word. That's not fellowship. That's talking. &gt;&gt; Fellowship means working together toward a common purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's saying there is a fellowship of the mystery of God. Fellowship is a union of attributes, a cluster of natures. We are speaking of in the beginning. There's a mystery and there's a fellowship of the mystery. The fellowship of the mystery is made of attributes from before the foundation of the world. And then when those attributes are manifested, those attributes become sons &gt;&gt; in time. What's our subject about? Becoming sons. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Paul had a revelation. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; That sons had to be manifested in time. You remember this? Romans 8:19. for the earnest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God. So Paul is literally saying so the scripture shows it the rest of creation and not just the rest of creation. The creature is not creatures out there. It's this creature &gt;&gt; also. This creature your own body is it senses something. It senses that there must be a full redemption. It secretly yearns for the manifested sons of God. Hey, &gt;&gt; manifest means to be revealed, to be made known. Is your body waiting for the manifested sons? Your body is waiting for one particular manifested son. &gt;&gt; The one that matches you. &gt;&gt; That's the son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Men of the Old Testament who God did such great things through. Most things were miraculous beyond anything that we have ever experienced. Do not they did not achieve full sun status. Wait, you just missed that or you didn't get the whole thing. I'm saying you got a guy like Moses or Noah who built this ark that saved the world. the the Moses who uh opened the Red Sea and did all those fantastic plagues. You know, I hear people today talking about the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter 2, you know, and how powerful it is and they came out and they they spoke in tongues, they prophesied and we must go back to that and you know what is speaking in tongues, prophesying and healing as compared with opening the Red Sea. and building an ark that saves the world or tearing out a lion from jaw to jaw. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How about you spoke with tongs? Fantastic. &gt;&gt; H David one stone killing a giant who was going to decimate all of the Hebrews. But you spoke with tongs. Wumpy little fella. H this this is my point. Power. They want power. I'm saying to you with all the great power that Moses had, that David had, that Abraham had, that Noah had, that Samson, Jacob, Isaac, the whole lot of them, with all the great power they possessed, of spoken word, of having a pillar fire with them, of seeing angels, they did not attain sons of God status. They died and went to Abraham's bosom &gt;&gt; which was fifth dimension. &gt;&gt; They did not enter into theophanes. When the witch of Endor called up Samuel spirit, she said, "I see an old man with a bald head covered in a mantle." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When brother Baron saw the generation of Christians, he said they were 18 to 21. sparkling eyes, sparkling teeth, brand new people, and that great prophet Samuel. You know, a lot of you young people, you need to go and read the story of Samuel. It is amazing. Samuel was the last judge. His story is amazing for young men to understand, to know what it means to serve God. the last judge and the first prophet in the promised land, right? He told the disciples, so Christ told the disciples, I must go to prepare a place for you that where I exist, you might exist also. &gt;&gt; Why did he say that? Because prior to that, there was no prepared theophanes. You had to wait for this son &gt;&gt; to come to bring forth many brethren like unto himself. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So he told us to the disciples. In other words, he Christ came to make a way for those attributes that were in him that were hidden in him to who existed in heaven in the logos to now become theophanes. He came to make the way back possible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those attributes were manifested on earth as fleshly bodies, but they were not yet revealed as sons of God. Becoming sons of God is bigger than just being in a church &gt;&gt; and saying, "I'm a son of God. I accept that I was a sinner. He died for my sins. I'm waterbaptized." Sons of God has got to do with theophanes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not people who claim to be Christians or people who claim to be sons of God. They did not reach the status of sons of God. They were sons of God. They were sons of God on earth because they believed in God because they followed his word. But they were not yet theophanes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The sons of God had not yet been revealed. you 1 Corinthians 15:47-49. The first man is of the earth, earthy. The second man is the Lord from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; is yours the offer. &gt;&gt; As is the earth, such are they also that are earthy. As is the heavenly, such are they also. In other words, if you read before this, he's saying there's difference between bodies. There's celestial bodies and they have their glory. There's terrestrial bodies, they have their glory. Some men will come and ask, "What bodies will they come through?" That's how he preaches a sermon. Says, "Now verse 49, as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly." &gt;&gt; Amen. The whole uh theme of Paul's ministry is we have been called to become the sons of God. Right? Paul's entire message was that. Is that right? And then uh when Christ ascended, he took the spirits of the Old Testament saints that were trapped in the bosom of Abraham in paradise and he said paradise was emptied out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he took those first. But they waited a few days in earthly dimension status trapped between two worlds and when he ascended he took them with him and then they attain sons of God status. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How about you living on earth? As many as received him. Remember John 1:1. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word was God. And all things were created by him. Amen. For him was everything created. And there came one uh uh John who came for a witness to bear witness of that light. But he was not that light. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he and he goes on and on on and he comes to verse 12 and he says, "As many as received him &gt;&gt; to them gave he power to become &gt;&gt; sons of God." Not even to become sons of God. To become the &gt;&gt; sons of God. The sons of God is a specific designation that goes right back to before the world was not to become just sons of God. The sons of God to them that receive him gave he power. That's the baptism of the Holy Ghost. That is the Holy Spirit being given to you giving you ability to become sons of God. Gives you that ability to believe the word so that your celestial body begins to grow in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. adoption part two. What do you think the writer of this book that seen and seen where it would be manifested in the last days waiting and groaning for those sons of God to rise in the last days with the power of the Holy Ghost at the end of the age? And all the ministries who love this story and all they stop with is the sons of God must rise up in the last days with the power. What power? speaking in tongues, prophesying, shouting, screaming, uh jumping around, Holy Ghost dynamics, this and that. What for? To what end? &gt;&gt; We've seen that already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How is that revealing it again? &gt;&gt; It was hidden. Now it must be revealed. We've seen all that already. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; that's doesn't need to be revealed. Yes, &gt;&gt; those sons of God will rise in the last day with the power of the Holy Ghost. There's a special designation that must come at the end of the age for what reason? Not gifts of the Holy Ghost to reveal the secret things from the foundation of the world to bring it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 52. Now, let's go back into the foundation of the world again and get a revelation and see if it were right or not. The gifts of the Holy Ghost had to come in. It was the earnest to bring you to this point. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Had there been no sin, there would be no reason for gifts of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If we all came through Adam, why would we be speaking with tongues? &gt;&gt; Why would we be prophesying? Why would there be healing? Why would there be knowledge? Why would there be wisdom? Why would there be any other gifts of the Holy Ghost if we all came through Adam? That would have been the hidden things manifested. The the fellowship of the mystery revealed right now sitting here in this corrupt condition of earthly flesh. This is a fraction of what fellowship means. &gt;&gt; You're right. This isn't even a real thing. Half of you here don't even like each other. Don't bluff me. The rising of sons in the last days only occurs under the manifestation of the seventh seal because it is the mystery that brings him back to earth. It is the word coming to sons and sons becoming the word. It is the mystery of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why the rapture is a mystery that must be revealed to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at the rapture. They must rise. Sons of God to rise in the last. You know what rise means? Resurrected &gt;&gt; in the last. That's the real resurrection. &gt;&gt; The resurrection of the living dead. &gt;&gt; You who were dead while you were living &gt;&gt; needed to be resurrected. You needed connection with the mystery that was in him before the foundation of the world. That connection only comes by the open book &gt;&gt; by the opening of the seventh seal. Without that, there is no connection. You're just some Christian moving through this life. But with the open book, with the angel descending with the seven seal opening in our day, and you're connected with that mystery that was in him before the foundation of the world, now you are resurrected. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you have come from death into life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when does this happen? At the end of the age. &gt;&gt; When does the resurrection happen? At the end of the age. People are still waiting for a resurrection of the dead. We do not sorrow as those who have no hope. Those who you say are dead are not really dead. We know because the prophet has seen them already beyond the curtain of time. They are very much alive. &gt;&gt; They already in theophony. Amen. &gt;&gt; You do not prevent them which are asleep. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's why we don't sorrow as those who have no hope. I already know my father is enjoying his theophony right now. &gt;&gt; With so many of the other brothers that have gone on before and sisters and they're fellowshipping. We do not prevent them. &gt;&gt; We act like we're waiting for them to rise. &gt;&gt; They're waiting for you to rise. Amen. &gt;&gt; See, at the end of the age, to reveal and manifest the secret things from the foundation of the world. What secret things? Reveal and manifest. Paul states this clearly. Let's look at what Peter says. You love him, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a life. He he begotten us sometime before. Now he's begotten us again unto a lively hope again because sin came in. He had to we became begotten sons in a sinful body of flesh. He had to now bring the attribute to its fullness. Right. Unto. So you are not just begotten. You know this baby just born. You are begotten unto something. You are begotten unto a lively hope. Lively hope. Right? Lively stones. Remember that. Do you know what lively in the Bible means? It's got eternal life. &gt;&gt; This life here is dying. &gt;&gt; Yes. A lively hope means an eternal ambition, &gt;&gt; an eternal hope, an eternal target, an eternal end, eternal purpose. You are begotten to that. &gt;&gt; And that hope became a reality by the fact that Jesus rose from the dead by the resurrection of Christ. If Christ did not rise from the dead, nothing makes sense. making sense doesn't even sound right. &gt;&gt; Nothing is meaningful. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If he didn't rise from the dead, there is no hope of theophony. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The fact that he rose from the dead from the dead gives us the lively hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Got it. Verse four. To an inheritance. Now, there it is. This This should start stirring your heart up. Yes, &gt;&gt; you are begotten to an inheritance. &gt;&gt; What inheritance? This inheritance is incorruptible, &gt;&gt; right? Undefiled that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you. Verse five says, "Who &gt;&gt; are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So he said, "We've been begotten again." He says in verse four, "Into an incorruptible inheritance." What is incorruptible inheritance? Incorruptible means it's not of earth. Yes. &gt;&gt; Anything of earth is corruptible. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It breaks down. It's in time. It has bacteria. It breaks down. Decomposes. It's corruptible. Incorruptible means not of earth. Fadeth not away means it does not age. Means there is no time in it. It is not affected by the third dimension. Right? Fadeth not away. Undefiled means it has no sin. &gt;&gt; It cannot sin. &gt;&gt; Right? And then reserved in heaven for you kept by God. He could only say this after Christ, &gt;&gt; right? You know, we sing just build me a mansion just over the hilltop. That's carnal man speaking. If you don't understand what that mansion is, Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's not a triple story house with golden doors and circle staircase and grand piano underneath and lovely melodies playing through the whole system and Wi-Fi. Build me a mansion. This mansion is incorruptible. It has no sin. It's got no time in it. It does not fade away and it's reserved for you. It is your theophony body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sorry to disappoint you if you're looking for a nicer house there, &gt;&gt; but you know that's a nicer house, right? &gt;&gt; Because when the house of this tabernacle &gt;&gt; be dissolved, &gt;&gt; there is another one waiting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Another house. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's my mansion. &gt;&gt; Verse five. So in case you thought it was this kind of house, he says, "Who &gt;&gt; famous reserved in heaven for you?" Who? Who speaks of a person? Amen. &gt;&gt; Who tells us it's not an object, it's not a building, it's not it's a person. &gt;&gt; It's a theophony &gt;&gt; kept preserved by the power of God through faith and salvation. Your faith and salvation is keeping it by the power of God. Remember the quote we read last week, as the new birth grows in you, you have a celestial body growing in heaven. You cannot be in two bodies at once, but you can have two natures in you at once. But when this spirit leaves this body, you have another body waiting that you will go into. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I had some very nice questions by the way, which I can't speak of of now, but it's like, you know, brother Al, what are what are theophies doing in heaven? If our spirits are here, what are they like? I love kids. They ask the best questions. Uh my answer is I have no idea. What happens under the seventh seal saints? The seven seal mystery. I know some of you going to come back and ask me that question. It is the manifestation of the sons of God. What is the seventh seal mystery? What is the the foundation the foundational quote of the seventh seal? The seventh seal brings him &gt;&gt; back to earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. The revelation, the seventh seal brings him back to that's the foundation stone of it, right? What is it then? If it brings him back to earth, the seventh seal breaking, the book being opened, the attributes being revealed, the mystery being revealed, the fellowship of the mystery being revealed is the revealing of the sons of God that were hid in him before the foundation of the world. That is seeing your name in the book. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember how he speaks in the breach how John must have looked through the curtain. John just had a hallelujah shouting religion. Why? He said John must have seen him his name in the book. &gt;&gt; And he said there's John. &gt;&gt; He identified himself with what God revealed under the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. The completion saints is when all that is in heaven and all that is in earth that was in Christ comes together in a union. Ephesians 1:10. Is that right? All that was in heaven, all that is in earth in Christ comes together. Invisible union of the heavenly and the earthly. The marriage of the lamb and his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the completion. So, it is the fellowship of the mystery that was hidden God before the foundation of the world. 2,000 years ago, Paul knew they had son of God status. Is that right? Paul knew. Now, we have son of God status, but the fullness of it was not yet revealed to them. How do we know? Okay, Sunday school, remember this? We were speaking about this before. 1 and two. Behold, what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us. Some of you don't get lost in the song, please. That we should be called the sons of God. This is Peter making a confession, right? Please, this is not salty song book. I see some of you don't know what I'm talking about. You didn't grow up. You were lucky enough not to grow up with Salty. that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore, the world knoweth us not. That's telling you it was a mystery hit. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because it knew him not. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; the revelation of who he is reveals to you who you are. The world cannot know who you are because they cannot know who he is because they do not know who he is. What is the revelation of God? It is Christ. What is the revelation of Christ? It is you. &gt;&gt; The bride. He hath declared the father who hath declared the son. &gt;&gt; And the revelation of it all. St. John 14:20. In that day you shall know that I am in the father, the father in me, I in you, you in me. We are one. Brother Mhamm completes that whole thing. &gt;&gt; Beloved, now are we the sons of God. &gt;&gt; And Peter is saying, Peter is is saying it does not yet appear what we shall be. In other words, I don't really know what's the revelation of that theophony. Right now, we don't have the full revelation of what it's going to be. People only think this is about the bodies, you know, corporal body and this it does it does not yet appear what we shall be. They only attribute this to the the physical substance of the body. But when he shall appear, we shall be like him. Again, they only limit that to the body. &gt;&gt; For we shall see him as he is. This is talking about the revelation of sons of God. This talking about the fellowship of the mystery being revealed. Peter does not know because the whole body has not yet been manifested. &gt;&gt; Peter has not seen the age of Smyrna, the age of thyra, the age of Pergamus. He has not seen Sardis, Philadelphia, Leosia, the capsule age. He cannot know the mystery. It does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know when he shall appear, we shall be like him. &gt;&gt; That's what we stand on. But today, we're not saying that. Today we are right here looking back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have seen it all manifested. We've seen all the virtues. We've seen all the church ages. All the mysteries are revealed. The prophet came to tell us this seventh messenger will reveal all the mysteries. &gt;&gt; That's what happens under revelations 10. The mystery of God is finished as he had declared to his servants a prophet. We don't say it does not yet appear what we shall be. We know there is a fellowship of the mystery. We see ourselves included in all of that. Peter didn't know us. We know him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul in prophecy was prophesying of the opening of the seventh seal and the book coming down. &gt;&gt; The first church with such great signs and wonders in Christ recognized the manifestation in themselves. They could feel it. They could know I have an angel that is beholds the face of the father in heaven. They could understand that I have a body. I have a theophony somewhere. They could sense there were sons. They could feel the connection with their theophonies, but not in its fullness. &gt;&gt; Paul could see that it would take the second coming of Christ for the fullness of the revelation to be complete. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read in the adoption message. You you love him, saints? &gt;&gt; Oh my. That's very small. Okay, if you can follow me now, let's read just a little further. And we have he says he reads according as he had chosen us in the foundation of the world there be holy without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto adoption predestinated unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ himself according to the good pleasure of his will. What did he do? By fornowledge he foresaw us knowing that he was a savior self-existent. There was no angels or nothing. Just God l Elohim with a self-existence one. Nothing but him alone. But in him was savior. But what's he going to say? There's nothing lost. knowing that that he knowed that this great attribute in him would project something out yonder that he could save. &gt;&gt; Then when it did that by fornowledge he looked and looked down and saw everyone that would accept it &gt;&gt; by fornowledge. You know, this this is a mystery where you bring the two sides of predestination together because the Calvinism idea just sends people crazy. You mean God just had these selective chosen people, you know, and he's so unfair? No. He's saying here he looked by fornowledge and saw everyone would accept it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he saw everyone who would accept it. He recognized something about his creation, those coming in that time. and he could see the attribute that matches with that &gt;&gt; in time. Therefore, when the attribute hits this body, it is grace to the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what grace is. The attribute that is in me, he could have put in anyone else at some other time. But it would need the same characteristics. &gt;&gt; But in this time, that attribute found you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He could see it. He could place it. He could predestinate it by forn knowledge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You still with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then by doing so, he said to save that the only way I can do it will be come down myself and be made flesh and take the sin of man upon him and die for him that I might be the one that's worshiped because he's God the object of worship. Paragraph 109. All right. Then he come down and take it upon himself. And while he did that, he did that that he might save you who wants to be saved. See, free will is still in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean by fornowledge the infinite God who know all things saw the lamb? He slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world. He put your name in the lamb's book of life. He seen the deceitfulness of Satan, what he would do. So he put your name on there and he said that Antichrist would be so religious, so good, such a fine fellow, such a smart man, such a religious man that he could deceive the very elect if it was possible. But it isn't impossible because it is impossible because their names were for ordained before the foundation of the world. There are those attributes hidden in him before the foundation of the world. There is no way those attributes will fail. Your body might fail. &gt;&gt; This body is going to fight back against it. &gt;&gt; But there's something about your soul. Your soul has free will but wants to choose God's will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I like this last part. There you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. saints. He knew you wanted to be saved while others wouldn't. That's a big deal. Therefore, you were part of the cluster of attributes who would desire salvation and desire to be connected to the attribute. You know, I could I could spend a lot of time telling you who you are right now, who you really are. Hm. Losers, racists, jealous, lustful. Yeah, that's all that this body is. &gt;&gt; Envious, covetous, all of that. &gt;&gt; But there's something about you. Listen, if you just leave the message, you become everything you preached against. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Instantly. Just leave the word of God. You will become everything you preached against. You will be the biggest hypocrite in the world because everyone you spoke against or judged, you'll be worse than them tenfold. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; The attribute of who you are in Christ was preserved in him until the time appointed so that it would face the challenge of its time and defeat the enemy. The reason the attribute is placed in you and that particular attribute is because there's something in there that needs to be overcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that attribute has the power to overcome that. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why you are not better than someone else. &gt;&gt; You're not higher than someone else. Someone else doesn't have your experience. Someone else can never have your struggle. &gt;&gt; You have an attribute in you to deal with that. That's the purpose. By that attribute doing what it's meant to do, it will reveal the fellowship of the mystery. There you would come to earth in attribute form according to his sewing of the seed. The seed would be swed in the chosen body and believe the word for its day. It would remain a mystery until the seventh seal open and Jesus himself descended with wait for it. Jesus descended with a &gt;&gt; shout. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go back to the title. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Angels sing. &gt;&gt; Sons of God shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; Again, those attributes in the beginning were not screaming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is a shout? Amen. Let's read the rapture. Sunday school, listen up. Three things happen. A voice, a shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears. Now, a shout Jesus does all three of them when he is descending. A shout. What is the shout? It's the message coming forth first. The living bread of life bringing forth the bride. &gt;&gt; There is the shout. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this happens in his descent. &gt;&gt; This only comes down with the open book. &gt;&gt; Not before that. &gt;&gt; Before that, they still did not know the fellowship of the mystery. They still didn't have the shout. &gt;&gt; But the shout has come down with the second coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul knew that it would be revealed. See, in attribute, if they shouted in manifested time, in manifested uh form, there has to be a shout again. Sons of God must shout for joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is now silence in heaven, but there's a great shout on earth. &gt;&gt; People take these and make these literally about shouting with vocal cords. &gt;&gt; What vocal cords did the attributes have in heaven? &gt;&gt; The shout was a mystery because it was the hidden attribute form before the foundation of the world. It was in attribute form. It was not shouting with vocal cords the same way it was in singing with vocal cords. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Singing was proclaiming a victory. &gt;&gt; Shouting is what? If singing was overcoming for the angels, what is the shout for sons of God? There was no one to manifested before. It could only be manifested in the end time because the sons of God are revealed in the end time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now it is manifest. A shout went out by a voice crying in the wilderness of Pentecost, "Come out of her, my people." &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of her sins, &gt;&gt; that was a shout that attracted us, &gt;&gt; right? And told us never to be a part of organized religion again. &gt;&gt; It's not talking about your Methodist church, you came from, your Catholic church, you came from, this church, and that. He's talking about organized religion. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come out of her, my people, and be not partakers of her sins and her abominations. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The a shout crying in the wilderness of Pentecost called us in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Babylon is judged. It is fallen. And then comes the shout of the bride. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to see this. I'm going to read this quote for you from why I am against organized religion. Notice the 19th chapter in is next. &gt;&gt; Everyone awake. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; buckle your seat belts. &gt;&gt; After these things. That's that's the key there. After these things. After what things is reading Revelations 19, that means it's after Revelations 18 and Revelation 17 and Revelation 16. Right? What is Revelation 16? The vials, whatever. Revelation 17, the revelation of the great that sits upon the beast with seven heads and 10 horns. In Revelations 18 is the destruction of that great and the beast. After these things, &gt;&gt; did you notice here in Revelations 19? After these things, watch. After what? After the message of come out of her. After that me, after the message of come out of her, watch is the shout of the bride saints with the bridegroom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Going to the marriage of the lamb. How close are we then, brother? What's the last call? Come out of Babylon. What's the last call? Come out of Babylon. Come out of organized religion. &gt;&gt; Don't come and form a message church and form an organized religion again. &gt;&gt; Come out of her. That's the reason message people are failing. You come out of one system into another system. You put in cold and formalism into the word. You put in radicalism into the word. You make another system. When you come out of a system and you bind people to a system, these are sons of God. They were not bound before the foundation of the world. They were free in him. They had a shout in them. If they shouted in attribute form, there must be a shout in this time. You will not hear a shout. If there's organized religion, because the first shout was, "Come out of her, my people." And after Babylon is destroyed, that is the shout of the bride saints with the bridegroom. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is now. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You want to read Revelation 19:1-7 with me? This is the shout that comes after the shout of come out of her. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, looks like I went back to that. Revelations 19 1-7. We'll start 1 to 3. After these things, after what things? destruction of organized religion. I don't want you to ever say that is the Catholic Church and the Vatican and the Methodist and the Baptist and all that because you people make up organized religion. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the organized religion you made up by your free will &gt;&gt; to trap yourself and other people into come out of her. You will only see the fellowship of the mystery manifested in you. You will only have this shout when you come out of that thing. &gt;&gt; Stop blaming denominational people or a previous religion you came from or some other kind of thing. You have to come out of that that needs to be destroyed. &gt;&gt; And there is the shout. Hallelujah. Salvation and glory and all the symbols. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's a reality to this. And honor and power unto the Lord our God. Here it is. For true and righteous are his judgments. For he hath judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and had avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said hallelujah. And her smoke rose up forever and ever. This is the shout. The first part of the shout is what? The rejoicing. The manifestation that in you is judged the great &gt;&gt; The fellowship of the mystery, the strength of the attribute in you is to break up organized religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; You cannot stand it. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you cannot stay in it. You cannot make a new message denomination. &gt;&gt; This attribute will not do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will not cluster together because that organized religion spirit is not of the same purpose. &gt;&gt; It cannot speak for God. It cannot stand in this world. It will join itself with fallen angels. &gt;&gt; The first part of the shout is what is that? What is it? It's the revelation the seals. &gt;&gt; What is the exposing and the judgment of the great war which should corrupt the earth with the fornication? That is the exposing the seals. When you break off the religious spirit and the political spirit and the demonic spirit and the paleos rider and the fifth seal and the sixth seal, you are exposing organized religion, you are laying it flat on its back. You are slaughtering it and dissecting it into pieces. It tells you what each spirit is. It tells you religious spirit is a poser, is an impostor. It's religion. It's your prayer life. It's your reading your message books. It's listening to your tapes. It's all the new system you created. It's a white horse rider acting like you're righteous but no faith inside. &gt;&gt; No standing for truth. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's the first part of the shout. And the 4 and 20 elders when the 4 and20 elders see that that's the old and new testament. When they see that breaking of organized religion in you, it bows down. &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the New Testament gives up all the types and shadows and reveals everything that you have confessed that you have done. God that sat on the throne saying, "Amen. Hallelujah. Praise be to God." And a voice came out of the throne saying, "Praise our God, all ye servants, and you that fear him both small and great. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, there it is. Shout, and the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings sing, hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotence reignth. Here it is. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him, for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready. &gt;&gt; What? So the first part of the shout is the exposing of organized religion, the exposing of the enemy. The second part is they shouted for &gt;&gt; joy. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him because what is happening? The second part of the shout is uniting with the word, &gt;&gt; the bridegroom. So you break away from the old system and you come in a perfect union with a revealed word of the hour. That is connecting with sons of God. That is connecting with theophony. That is not religion. There's nothing anyone can reveal to you about that. Nobody's going to show that to you personally. That is something can only happen when you break away completely from every form of system religions. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "This is the shout of the bride and the bridegroom that comes after that." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come out of her was the prophet's ministry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; After that is the shout of the bride saints and the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 1-9. We read 1:7. We are the attributes that shouted in the beginning from the foundation of the world. We are the part of the cluster that is called bride and bridegroom because we once shouted in third form when we are manifested on earth. We will find one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will be drawn together because there is now a shout in us. &gt;&gt; The shout has come in his descent. He's brought that book down. There is a shout. That shout revealed the enemy, exposed false religion and and introduced us to our bridegroom. That shout is in us. We live for that. &gt;&gt; We correct ourselves for that every single day. &gt;&gt; Every single day, we feel that conviction inside. I shouldn't do this. I shouldn't do this. This isn't right. Nobody else lives like that. &gt;&gt; Nobody else has the fellowship of the mystery. Those people out there don't even care what happens in their lives. They can drink a beer, wine, whatever without even any conscience problems. They can fornicate. They can do drugs. They can smoke. They can swear. They can curse. They can do everything they want to do. No problem. &gt;&gt; Not you. &gt;&gt; You will torment yourself &gt;&gt; because there is a shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something drawing you together. There's a cluster of attributes that are manifested in this day that are connected with a theophony because sons of God are being revealed in this time. What is the shout in us? Praise be to God. If you take that where it says praise be to our God. Let's put it in our language. When it says um let us be glad and rejoice or the previous one, right? We acknowledge the revealing of the seals that has exposed the defeating the defeated enemy. I'm just telling you what it says in our language. You have now rightfully judged where it says you are the righteous and true judge. You have rightfully and true truly judged the immoral spirit of organized religion which corrupted all of human nature. Did you see that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That for true and righteous are your judgments. He had judged the great war which did corrupt the earth with her fornication. Right? There's the first part. We acknowledge your judgment. That means Lord, I believe the revelation of the seven seals completely. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With all my soul cuz I know it completely judges immoral organized religion. &gt;&gt; I will never be a part of that. &gt;&gt; Right? You have set right what has been done wrong against and it says which had avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. Organized religion has murdered children of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not just in real life but also robbed them of happiness. &gt;&gt; Robbed them of things they could have throughout the ages. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal being open has judged her. It's over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lastly, that last point, let us be glad and rejoice. I challenge any one of you. Don't do it now. Could take out those wonderful phone of yours and Google the meaning of the word rapture. How many think you know what rapture means? Anybody? Yes. Not the drug. Joy. &gt;&gt; That's the real meaning of rapture. &gt;&gt; Extreme joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Intense joy that gathers your spirit up into an elated state. That is English. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what rapture actually. Imagine all this time we're going on about rapture being transfiguration, translation, and making doctrines about it. Talk about bodies and all of that. Rapture is extreme joy. &gt;&gt; Extreme joy, intense joy that elates your spirit and makes you rise to a higher dimension. &gt;&gt; That is what existed in the beginning in those attributes that were hidden in him. That was hidden. That cannot be known if you are still stuck in organized religion. Why do you hunger thirst? Why do you fail? Why does the heavenly father is trying to reveal all these mystery secrets to you, but you'll let so many things get these things out of you? This is what the world is trying to do. He's trying to create another Eden for you. Is that right? It's what we spoke about last week. He cannot touch the word. The seven seal has laid it flat. The the seals being open has opened up everything to us. You you cannot give us organized religion again. You cannot force feed that to us. It's not going to happen. The only last thing this enemy has is to produce another Eden, &gt;&gt; a better Eden, &gt;&gt; a nicer life, a better distraction from what? From coming together. &gt;&gt; From the fellowship of the mystery, dividing the brotherhood. That's the last play the enemy has, right? What does the loss play at the at the at the supper table before Christ was crucified? Who should be the one who would betray you? &gt;&gt; Lord, tell us. Is it he? Is it him? &gt;&gt; And he says to them, Peter, feed my sheep. Keep the brotherhood. &gt;&gt; That's your strength. Stay united, stay one. &gt;&gt; What is the enemy going to do? &gt;&gt; He will produce a better Eden for you, a better idea, a better uh form of life, a better way to serve God, a better way to produce the bride, a better way to come to the capstone, a another way to bring forth sons of God, another idea, breaking up the brother. That that's what's happening right now. We are sniping at each other. ministers sniping at each other from pulpits. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Bringing each other down. Why would you do that? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For us, it means the uniting together of manifested attributes of this day that express the purpose of God that was kept secret through time but revealed in the last days. Verse 8 says, "And to her," that's not there. That is after the shot. "And to her," are you ready? was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. &gt;&gt; What is the fine linen you are waiting to be clothed in? Clean and white, which is the righteousness of saints for the rapture. Where is that cloth coming from? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is your theophony. &gt;&gt; That is the sons of God. &gt;&gt; That is the fullness. That is the the the fullness of adoption. That's what you have been predestinated unto. To her was granted that she should receive her theophony. That the bride would be clothed in the theophony she long awaited for. That is the completion of sons. &gt;&gt; Morning stars sang and sons of God shouted for joy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Angels overcame fallen angels, but sons of God manifest the fellowship of the mystery that was hidden God before the foundation of the world. And that is the fellowship of the mystery. &gt;&gt; Is God becoming man and man becoming God? &gt;&gt; God became man in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You become theophony which is King Theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. God becoming man, man becoming God. There is the mystery. It is only manifested in manifested signs. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads together. Amen.
