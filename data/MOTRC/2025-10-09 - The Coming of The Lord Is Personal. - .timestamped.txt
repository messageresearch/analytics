[0:00] The first coming of Christ is probably
[0:03] the greatest of all types.
[0:07] Amen.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; The greatest of all types because what
[0:11] you see there, I mean those who say his
[0:14] coming is an instant and whatever. The
[0:15] first coming was 33 and a half years.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; The first coming was
[0:20] &gt;&gt; the first coming was the star in
[0:22] Bethlehem.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; It was Mary the angel. It was Zechariah.
[0:27] It was uh um uh uh it was uh uh John the
[0:32] Baptist. It was turning water into wine.
[0:36] It was Zakius. It was blind Barameus,
[0:39] the woman at the well. It was everybody,
[0:42] right?
[0:43] &gt;&gt; What do you see there? Is the coming an
[0:46] instant to everybody?
[0:48] &gt;&gt; Now,
[0:49] &gt;&gt; when he came to Nathaniel, was the
[0:50] coming to Zakius?
[0:53] When he came to Zakius, was the coming
[0:55] to B blind Barameus?
[0:57] &gt;&gt; When he was blind bottom, was the coming
[0:59] to the woman at the well?
[1:01] &gt;&gt; When the woman at the well hadn't seen
[1:03] the coming, did it mean he was not
[1:04] there?
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Of course, he was there.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; But the seventh seal has to be open to
[1:11] the individual.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; That's what happens under this mystery.
[1:15] &gt;&gt; Only when it's revealed to you is the
[1:17] coming to you. Which is why we never you
[1:19] don't get stuck with saying 63 February
[1:21] 28th. No,
[1:24] &gt;&gt; of course there's a global thing, but
[1:25] the coming is personal to every person
[1:29] who is called by the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:31] in this last day.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Look at what happens.
[1:35] Here's John the Baptist.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; He's the prophet, right? He's standing
[1:39] in the water. Something is revealed to
[1:42] him.
[1:43] What is it going to be? Is it going to
[1:45] be my death? Is it this? Is it that
[1:48] you're going to be introducing the
[1:49] Messiah? But what happens? He's standing
[1:52] there in water. He's doing what he's
[1:53] supposed to do. He sees a sign in the
[1:54] heavens.
[1:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; That vindicates the word.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; He says, "It's my Lord."
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that taketh away
[2:04] the sin of the world.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; Their first fold. Then the Lord joins
[2:08] him in the water.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Pro the prophet said God and his prophet
[2:12] becoming one there
[2:14] &gt;&gt; in the water in the word.
[2:16] Can you accept it?
[2:18] &gt;&gt; Can you see what happened? They're going
[2:19] to say the the prophet is making too
[2:21] much of himself.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; What what happens there? That's not some
[2:24] story. He says, "Lord, I'm not worthy of
[2:27] this. Me baptize you.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; A son of man revealing this son of man,
[2:32] suffer it to be so."
[2:34] &gt;&gt; To fulfill all righteousness.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39] &gt;&gt; Christ descending. God descending. And
[2:41] then he goes out and he's left the scene
[2:43] and he's finding the bride
[2:46] &gt;&gt; individually
[2:48] &gt;&gt; while the prophet is continuing
[2:50] &gt;&gt; and you know the prophet said and they
[2:52] ask why does brother still talk about
[2:54] the coming after the coming the coming
[2:57] he says you see what happened with John
[2:58] the Baptist the forerunner he introduced
[3:01] him he ends up in prison
[3:04] &gt;&gt; he said he's seeing what's happening
[3:05] around him you remember 64 when he said
[3:09] I'm it feels like I'm preaching ing the
[3:11] souls in prison.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Is that the third pool? I've done this.
[3:17] We preached a seal. Something should
[3:19] have happened. Do you not see? Perhaps
[3:21] it's he it's in that message that he
[3:23] said the seventh seal brings him back to
[3:25] earth.
[3:25] &gt;&gt; Feels like the last part he's preaching
[3:27] to souls in prison. He says, uh, maybe
[3:29] the last one has already come in.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; Can it be? You know this. Go read the
[3:33] message if you haven't.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; I hope it hasn't. Right.
[3:39] &gt;&gt; Here was John in prison and he said,
[3:42] brother Ram says in COD question and
[3:44] answer. He said that eagle eye got
[3:46] filmed over.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; He said he sent his his disciples to say
[3:52] go and ask him are you the one?
[3:56] &gt;&gt; Why? He was anointed to be the
[3:57] forerunner
[3:59] &gt;&gt; when he was not revealing the seals in
[4:00] that time. When he was not Eleaser, he
[4:04] was still a seventh messenger. The
[4:06] seventh messenger is always going to say
[4:08] he's coming. He's coming. He's coming.
[4:10] Because he was still talking to
[4:11] Leodysia. In one message, you see
[4:14] seventh messenger,
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Eliza,
[4:17] &gt;&gt; a son of man revealing the son of man.
[4:19] It just depends on who you are.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; When you're reading
[4:24] &gt;&gt; because when you're reading, you'll have
[4:25] a different experience.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; And then he'll be Elijah. If you read it
[4:30] and you say, "I hate this man."
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Well, then you're reading as Jezebel.
[4:35] Yeah,
[4:36] &gt;&gt; I can't stand him. He picks on me.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; And then or I don't like him. He keeps
[4:43] taking everything. Well, that's Ahab,
[4:46] &gt;&gt; right? Everything from me. He's always
[4:49] persecuting me.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; But if you're the bride, it's Eleazar.
[4:54] It's calling. It's a son of man
[4:55] revealing the son of man. Glory to God.
[4:58] So, you can see whatever you want to see
[5:00] in there, but the bride knows who he is.
[5:03] I want to close it with this one very
[5:05] very significant point. Amen. Few
[5:09] minutes.
[5:10] The mystery of his first coming was his
[5:14] death.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; That's the part that was not revealed.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. The government
[5:22] shall be upon his shoulder. All the
[5:24] prophecies in there. His coming. His
[5:27] coming. His coming. Remember there the
[5:29] the revelation they had of his coming.
[5:31] The prophet said he was going to be so
[5:33] many feet tall. He's going to have a
[5:35] spear a mile long and
[5:37] &gt;&gt; take all the Romans out and redeem
[5:39] Israel. Remember that? That was their
[5:41] revelation of his coming.
[5:42] &gt;&gt; Sounds very much like the fantasy the
[5:45] denominations have of the coming of the
[5:46] Lord today.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that, right?
[5:50] &gt;&gt; And he he came not the way they expected
[5:53] &gt;&gt; in humility. God hiding himself in
[5:56] simplicity and revealing the same.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; That's how he came. Amen. So here
[6:02] there's a mystery. He came to die.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; The Messiah.
[6:09] &gt;&gt; That seven thunder part of his coming
[6:14] &gt;&gt; they could not deal with.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; It fooled everybody.
[6:18] &gt;&gt; They were even standing there saying if
[6:20] you are him
[6:21] &gt;&gt; get yourself off the cross
[6:23] &gt;&gt; because we know that's what you're
[6:25] capable of.
[6:26] &gt;&gt; He willed himself to be there.
[6:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; That spirit to leave him to get heaven.
[6:32] He had to die a man.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him, saints?
[6:37] &gt;&gt; That third fold. So here's what
[6:39] happened. Watch the descent. He
[6:42] suspended between heaven and earth at
[6:45] Calvary.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; What happens when he suspended? It was
[6:48] the word exposed for the world to see.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; And the word says, "If I be lifted up,
[6:53] &gt;&gt; I will draw men unto me." Right? He hung
[6:56] there for a space of time
[6:58] &gt;&gt; between heaven and earth, between two
[7:01] dimensions.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; It was for that moment of rejection.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; The world did not recognize him.
[7:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's our Lord up there."
[7:14] &gt;&gt; They said, "It's rocket."
[7:20] &gt;&gt; The church rejected him.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; The elect were unsure. Yeah.
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; Standing there.
[7:28] How can this be? Hiding in the crowd.
[7:30] Peter denying him. The man with the
[7:32] revelation, thou art the Christ, the son
[7:34] of the living God, and says, "No, no,
[7:35] no, no. You know, I can't really say
[7:38] what it is.
[7:40] I'm not one of them, but I believe in
[7:42] the coming of the Lord,
[7:46] &gt;&gt; turmoil inside,
[7:48] &gt;&gt; because they don't know what to make of
[7:49] this."
[7:50] &gt;&gt; The church went through turmoil when
[7:52] everything started coming out. Oh yeah,
[7:54] it's rocket fuel. Oh, it's this or it's
[7:56] that. No, it can't be. And we got proof
[7:59] and proof and proof and pro and the the
[8:02] silent church is just standing there.
[8:04] What's happening? What's happening? How
[8:07] can this be? Everyone that the elders
[8:10] told us the rapture was going to take
[8:12] place so soon. The redemption was going
[8:14] to happen. What's going on? They all
[8:17] dispersed. The message split up.
[8:21] Peter goes back to nakedness on the boat
[8:26] &gt;&gt; fishing back to where he was called
[8:28] from.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Everyone dispersed, separated, even the
[8:32] two on the way to Emmas. In the
[8:34] meantime, a second fold is happening. A
[8:37] glorious second fold.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; The son of man is descending
[8:42] further into the regions of the lost
[8:45] &gt;&gt; because that seven seal is about to take
[8:47] away the power of death and hell. Amen.
[8:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. They did not know what was going
[8:53] on as a total mystery that he would do
[8:55] such a thing and he would take captivity
[8:57] captive.
[8:58] &gt;&gt; He goes, I like the way the prophet says
[9:00] in the atunement message. He walks down
[9:02] the corridor. There's those that knew
[9:03] him. There's those that didn't. And the
[9:04] other one is saying, "That's him. That's
[9:06] him. That's the voice that spoke to us.
[9:08] That's the one that told me this." And
[9:09] he takes the keys of death, hell, and
[9:11] the grave. And he comes back up in the
[9:14] resurrection. And all the things that
[9:16] happen in the resurrection is the
[9:18] unknown language.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; Remember that there's all these
[9:23] disciples, all the people there. And
[9:25] what are these two on the way to Emus
[9:27] said? You know, someone saw a vision of
[9:30] angels
[9:32] and told us he's here.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on.
[9:36] &gt;&gt; And we don't know what to believe. I
[9:38] mean, there's no quotes for it. I mean,
[9:39] the quotes are insufficient. And we
[9:42] didn't really believe them. And then the
[9:43] others went there and then they saw he's
[9:44] gone. But there's still no quote to say
[9:47] it
[9:48] &gt;&gt; outright
[9:50] [Applause]
[9:52] &gt;&gt; at the rising of the sun
[9:55] &gt;&gt; on the the day after the Sabbath
[9:59] &gt;&gt; in the bride age.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; There's no we're not I don't know why
[10:04] they they're crucifying us for saying
[10:05] bride age as the prophet even says so.
[10:08] We're not in the Pentecostal age. Amen.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; They can't accept us. There's plenty of
[10:13] quotes. We're not Luther. We're not
[10:15] Wesley. We're not in Pentecost.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; We're out of that.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; The rising of the sun in the eighth day,
[10:22] which is going back to the original. A
[10:24] mighty angel descends from heaven cries
[10:27] with a loud voice. You put it all
[10:29] together. Revelations 10. Roman gods
[10:31] traditions are struck. Blind, dead,
[10:33] powerless. Angel rolls away a great
[10:36] heavy seal.
[10:38] Glory. an elected woman sees him,
[10:44] &gt;&gt; not as he was seen before.
[10:47] &gt;&gt; She's she's looking at the word. She's
[10:49] reading it. She's not sure what she's
[10:51] seeing.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; She says, "Have you seen my Lord?"
[10:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "Why seek ye the living amongst
[11:01] the dead?"
[11:06] &gt;&gt; He's not there.
[11:08] &gt;&gt; Where is he? Please tell me where you've
[11:10] laid him.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that revelation.
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Turns around.
[11:17] Name.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; Mary.
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Here am I.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm in the right position.
[11:27] I know who I am. He knows who I am. He's
[11:30] called my name. Rabbi.
[11:34] &gt;&gt; That's what happens under the third
[11:36] fold.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; Who knows this?
[11:39] only the elect.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Does the Pharisees know it? Does the
[11:43] outside church know it?
[11:45] &gt;&gt; No. In fact, the type says the rest of
[11:49] the church put out a lie.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; That was purported by the disciples.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; A false doctrine
[11:57] &gt;&gt; to say he's come.
[11:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; And the lie was perpetuated.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[12:04] &gt;&gt; You want types? Here it is. Yeah,
[12:06] &gt;&gt; they put out a lie to say he's come, but
[12:08] they secretly stole his body. They
[12:10] hatched up some revelation for
[12:12] themselves.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; That's what was going on in the rest of
[12:14] the church. But in secret,
[12:17] &gt;&gt; every elect was being called.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; And everyone was having a different
[12:23] revelation of the coming,
[12:27] &gt;&gt; a personal revelation.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; Here am I.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; I'm the best father.
[12:36] Right?
[12:38] &gt;&gt; Because that's the revelation to me.
[12:39] You're going to have one, too. You're
[12:41] also going to be the best father, but
[12:42] not the best father like me. You're
[12:44] going to be the best father like you.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; See? So, the other one sees him. The
[12:50] others see him on the way to Emmas.
[12:52] Yeah. Then they they all sort of get
[12:54] gathered together by this mystery and
[12:56] they they get to this room. The one
[12:58] leaves there. He appears before Peter.
[13:01] Peters naked in the boat, dives in the
[13:03] water, comes out and clothes himself.
[13:06] The coming brings him back. Restoration.
[13:09] Then they're all getting into this room
[13:11] and then he appears. They're afraid.
[13:13] What is it? Is it corporal body? Is it
[13:15] theophony? What is it? Starts revealing
[13:18] himself to them. No, it's not a ghost.
[13:20] It's me.
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Come. And then there's some doubters
[13:23] there who said, you know what? I'll
[13:25] never believe it unless I see a quote.
[13:29] I'll never believe it unless I feel
[13:31] that.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; All he does is discern it.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; Thomas,
[13:37] it is me.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Come and feel if you want. It doesn't
[13:41] say he did.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; It just fell on his face. Lord,
[13:44] &gt;&gt; it is you. He saw the sign. He knew it
[13:48] was him.
[13:49] &gt;&gt; And then every other time he appears,
[13:51] he's there on the beach preparing fish.
[13:54] And they come and they're they just seen
[13:57] him.
[13:58] And now they're seeing another type.
[14:01] How is this working? Somebody else,
[14:04] Brother Chad preach, somebody else
[14:05] preaches. Is it really him? And they go
[14:07] up and he speaks and they recognize him
[14:11] &gt;&gt; every time after the that that
[14:15] crucifixion, the resurrection, it's
[14:17] revealing himself to the individual in
[14:21] different ways, in manifold ways. And
[14:24] here's the truth of it. In his
[14:26] resurrection, he only revealed himself
[14:28] to the elect. Did they have any solid
[14:32] proof?
[14:34] &gt;&gt; No. Could they convince anybody else?
[14:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[14:40] &gt;&gt; Only a personal experience
[14:42] &gt;&gt; and the proof was within them.
[14:49] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if you think you're going to
[14:50] convince everybody.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. The
[14:54] &gt;&gt; proof is within you.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; It is all within you.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:59] &gt;&gt; There it is. All of the seven seal in
[15:03] just a few selected types and shadows.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; Go through it yourself. I'm telling you
[15:09] detail verse for verse you will find the
[15:12] seven seal manifested.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll have that experience.
[15:18] Did not our hearts burn within us? Amen.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; Go through it and tell me you don't have
[15:23] a burning heart.
[15:25] &gt;&gt; When what? When the scriptures
[15:28] are made known.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They were not even saying
[15:32] their heart was burning when he was in
[15:34] the inn breaking the bread. Did not our
[15:36] heart burn within us when he spoke to us
[15:39] along the way revealing to us the types
[15:41] in the shadows. The coming of the Lord
[15:43] was something hidden. It's a new fold we
[15:46] never knew before. He never revealed the
[15:47] time nor the hour, but he has hidden it
[15:50] in every type and shadow of the Bible.
[15:54] It behooves you to go back in and walk
[15:57] the Emmas road and get the burning heart
[16:00] experience, saints of God. So now that
[16:03] we know all this, what now?
[16:06] &gt;&gt; You know it, you hear it, you see some
[16:09] of it, what now? Don't try to make it
[16:11] up. Don't try to force it.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; What does your heart tell you? You can
[16:17] listen to what I'm saying and you can be
[16:19] working things in your mind. Oh, he's
[16:21] saying things the prophet didn't say or
[16:23] he's doing things we're not allowed to
[16:24] do. Who allows you to do anything?
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Who disallows you to do anything? You
[16:30] possess the gates of the enemy. You
[16:32] handle the opening and the closing. What
[16:35] you say is what he allows. What you hire
[16:38] is hired. What you fire is fired. You've
[16:41] got to accept your place.
[16:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:45] Do you have a burning heart?
[16:47] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[16:49] &gt;&gt; What do you do?
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Surrender.
