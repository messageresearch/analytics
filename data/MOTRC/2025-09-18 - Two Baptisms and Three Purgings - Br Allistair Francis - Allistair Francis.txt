TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. God bless you saints. While you're standing, we would like to read two two portions of scripture from Matthew chap 11 and uh verse vers uh Matthew chapter 3 11-12 and also Ephesians 5 25- 27. So Matthew 3:11-12 is John the Baptist speaking and he says,"I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire, whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor and gather his wheat eat into the garner, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. Ephesians 5:25-27. This is Paul saying, "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish." Amen. Amen. The Lord add a blessing to his word. You may be seated. We like to greet you in the glorious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Certainly good to be with you uh this morning and to share the word of the Lord with you. We like to uh it seems we have a lot of um uh September babies in our church. Uh so we had u Joshua's birthday uh last week. We had um um Sister Rose and Sister Mercy. We had Sister Alicia, uh, Sister Cindy Ba, uh, Brother Ellen. I'm not sure if I missed anybody else out, but uh, there seems to be I'm not sure are these all Virgos or or Libra people, but um, God bless you, and we wish you all, um, eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh happy to have brother Joseph here with us from Cape Town and uh um somebody we know. So the Lord bless you and any other visitors among us. The Lord be with you and bless you this morning. So I'm I'm certainly thankful to be um sharing the word of God with you this morning. It's uh it's uh been a special uh time. I cannot tell you um what it feels like and what is what it feels like what is going on right now in the world. And I know this um this week this entire world has been rocked by the assassination of this young man Charlie Kirk from the United States and I was just uh watching the world go by and like there's a lot of people in South Africa who just don't care about it, some who don't know. There are those who listen to a certain type of media who are totally shocked by it and those who listen to a different type of media who really don't care at all and there are people who just are not interested but the world seems to be focusing around something and uh it's it's kind of shocking to me that in places like the United States and Western world it's it's almost there it's it's almost like um uh as if Jesus Christ died &gt;&gt; to a lot of people and uh and in the same way I mean it's just it's just a man &gt;&gt; and um the the amount of tributes and the the the big deal people make about and it is I mean it's a big deal for anyone to lose their life and to be assassinated and I think of uh you know the American government in the western world how they criticize us and we are barbarians and we are savages and there's people being killed in our streets and of course we we gotten so used to it. You know, somebody gets assassinated in in our country. It's like, yeah, it's just another one, you know. It's it's it's like that. But we get called savages and, you know, stabbings in our universities and things with knives and whatever, but you don't get anyone taken out by a long gun in our country. You've got the most sophisticated people, the most intellectual people. You've got the most they're they're they're happy people. They're wealthy people. They they've got this fantastic country with this fantastic life. And you get a kid taking out somebody &gt;&gt; with a long gun with a sniper rifle. It's crazy, &gt;&gt; you know. And uh so it doesn't matter how rich and sophisticated and educated you are, they're all savages. &gt;&gt; Yes. It just goes to prove what's in your heart is what you are going to be. &gt;&gt; And that no matter who you are and what you say, if you don't have the Holy Spirit, like the prophet says, you're just a beast. &gt;&gt; And uh that's, you know, I just I just think, you know, as Christians, don't get caught up in all these conversations. Uh I I mean, you can obviously have the conversations, but don't pick sides with the world. uh in the end they'll all stab you in the back because you are actually the people who are the embodiment of Christ &gt;&gt; in this world. We know the antichrist comes from within Christianity. &gt;&gt; So you can fight for Christians against another religion or something. It'll be the same Christians that stab you in the back. That's how it is. Believe me in the message it's no different. You you will not believe how much of persecution we are taking right now and people trying to silence us for the things that we preach. It's I don't even care to share it with you but it's on a daily basis and uh you wouldn't believe the things that are spoken about us. But you know we don't care. We we push on. I was telling another brother what is my name? If I perish I perish. You know for the sake of Christ I must push on. I must say what God has put in my heart to say. I don't care what they say about me. It's the word that must get forward. &gt;&gt; And uh so and uh if Christ took it, if every other person in the Bible took it, you know, it's um it's it's such an amazing time. I think also uh I'm I'm so sort of surprised at some of the message ministers who like think we are still in a wilderness walk. like they don't realize we've long crossed Jordan. &gt;&gt; We don't associate even with the type of Moses in the wilderness having those troubles. &gt;&gt; We don't we're we've crossed over Jordan. We're in the promised land. &gt;&gt; I would venture to say we're even past the days of judges. &gt;&gt; We're right now in a place where they need to choose a king. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. that if you're looking at the type I'm I'm saying that's where I think we are because like you've got Eli and Samuel the last judges of Israel and it's time to choose a king and they're going to choose Saul &gt;&gt; and that's to me it's that time where the human being is is to place someone on his throne. &gt;&gt; That's where we are. I'm not looking to a wilderness ministry with Moses and all these people tying me down to quotes of brother Bham and trying to cage me and &gt;&gt; help. You don't know where we are. &gt;&gt; We've crossed Jordan. We're in the promised land. We've gone through the days of the judges. We've been a long time without the prophet. &gt;&gt; People have not kicked out the nations that they were supposed to have kicked out. &gt;&gt; They still allowed those people hanging on. And we've gone through the days of the judges. people standing up and individuals taking the word in their hands to judge things. You're right now at the place where it's time to choose your king. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing. So, after our last service on begotten, born and converted, a brother met me. I must say I had after our brother's meeting I had my first social breakfast where we just had bacon and eggs and toast and uh with her brother and met with me and asked me to do a talk for the young people was quite concerned do a talk for the young people who want to get baptized and there are several young people who want to get baptized. So I got into my study and I casually started writing things on my board and drawing things out and arrows here and you know looking at things. Then it started forming into something that I started getting excited about because it was very much you know in line with the things we were teaching and begotten born and converted. So here we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord has laid something very simple yet very important on my heart and I believe it will help those starting out and also those who started out a long time ago and got caught up in worldly things and then others who forgot why they are called. &gt;&gt; So we're all in this. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just want to say to you uh church, I really appreciate you. You've got no idea how many people appreciate you. We're just a few people here but um you have become a machine by which the word can reach many people and by the anointing you bring to the word it is affecting many people's lives and that's I believe what is what is what we are here for. Amen. &gt;&gt; So it brought me to this uh title uh two baptisms and three purgings. two baptisms and three purgings. And this follows up from some of the things we have been teaching recently and to to think it all started when I preached in the USA on the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and the debacle that followed. I cannot tell you the amount of questions that have risen up from people just crying out for help. Just explain this to me. What you know uh how do I get the Holy Ghost? I believe what you're saying and you know the amount of questions and confusions that people have had in the past and saying you cleared it up for me. I now understand what I have. And that was the whole point of it. The whole point of it was to say there are so much of confusion with people as to whether they have the Holy Ghost or not because this Pentecostal idea is being revived and there people today who said they had the Holy Ghost 20 years ago are now doubting whether they have it. So that was the whole point of the message was to to bring that to the forefront and show you you are in a new day and there's a calling on your life, right? And so in our um so that's kind of like um the last few weeks since we got back, it's just been an a non-stop amount of questions and people just in need. And I've been trying to keep up with it. But um soon we I I I think we'll probably get back to our series in the name of God. Amen. So when we're looking at Ephesians 5:25-27, there are four things there that I want to bring out to to you. And um in that he says he um husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it. And then he said so that he could sanctify. Now remember sanctify we spoke on recently to make holy and we showed you we went in detail what consecration is what sanctification is and that it is not how good you are how good you are at keeping the message to be made holy is to be made useful &gt;&gt; right so and useful for his purpose and then we've got the word cleanse he said to so to sanctify and to cleanse right and the word cleanse means to purge or to purify uh and that means to remove unrighteousness. So you can when you think about a substance and we're going to talk about that and uh you're purifying that substance it means to remove impurities right. So Christ don't lose a thought gave himself for the church so he could sanctify and cleanse it. &gt;&gt; Yes. The purpose of him giving himself for the church was to sanctify. So you need to know, those of you young people want to get baptized, you need to know that Christ was manifest in the flesh for the purpose of sanctifying you for the purpose of God and for cleansing you for that purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the first thing that needs to be in your hand. And then he tells us how he does it. So how does he sanctify? How does he cleanse? By the washing of the water. by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the washing of the water is separation, &gt;&gt; right? We're going to get to that. And number four, by the word, which is So this is important. How are you sanctified? How are you cleansed? By the separation. &gt;&gt; By the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see it? So we want to simplify. So let's break it down. This week I had a call from a brother from the USA. We're just having a nice conversation. Um and uh he reflected the simple need. He in our conversation the the the thought of our conversation was brother this is what we need. Just break the word down so it can be applied to daily lives and simple understanding. and and and it must the word being preached on our message pulpits must move from theology to reality. &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's easy to just keep preaching words the prophet says, quoting quotes, making scriptures, uh talking about it and walking up and down shouting about um theology, but make it real. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what we we were discussing um the scripture um how are sons of God led by the spirit of God like and it was so simple. We were talking about how it's not about God literally showing you a pillar of fire or speaking in your ear. How are we led? Make that real. &gt;&gt; How am I supposed to be led of God in my business, in my school, in my choices? How am I led? Make that real. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I love. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the first thing to uh you know in this simple statement the basic understanding. So we want to make it real. We want to make you understand. So you're coming in baptism. You want to be baptized. We want to make it real to you what you're doing that you're not just you know um doing some church tradition like it is everywhere else. &gt;&gt; If you join our church, you must be baptized. you become a Christian, you must be baptized or else this. And then you say, "Well, did everybody else do it?" And I I've watched for so many years young people come to the water and they're so sheepish. Like, it's a very embarrassing thing. You know, somebody grabs you and dunks you in the water and then, you know, you come out and you're all splattering and wet and, you know, people are there handing you a towel singing songs. And when you're young, you know, and you're you're being told like it's it's almost like blackmail, like if you don't do this, you won't make it to heaven. You better do this. &gt;&gt; And uh and and that's the problem because they go into this being coerced into something and not really appreciating what just happened. So the simple basic understanding is that sanctifying and cleansing will be done by separating you from something else by the word. I'll say that again. Sanctifying and cleansing you as a young people, those wanting to be baptized, that separation is going to take place by the word. In other words, you cannot do this without the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's the first thing to understand is that the word of God, the word of God for your day separates you from others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not people from other word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; And you need to understand that. So let's let's go to sanctify first. Let's understand what it means by sanctify. So we have already explained this and I'm not going to spend too much of time on that. We've explained this that to be made holy or to be holy is or to be made holy is to select something to make it purposeful to you. So what is holy? Holy means to be separated for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So if you say uh this is me making as real as this chair is separated for me to sit on to play the guitar. That's my chair. &gt;&gt; That means it's holy unto me. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? It's separated for a purpose. Nobody else touch it. And to make it even more holy, from henceforth, this chair shall not be used for anything else but for me to sit on to play the guitar. &gt;&gt; Nobody else can use it. It cannot be used for somebody else to sit on for any other purpose. What makes it holy is it is selected. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For that particular purpose. Now that doesn't mean this is the best chair in the world. Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean this chair is without fault and without blame. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean this chair was just poofed out of nowhere by some supernatural event. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how this chair got here or what generation it came in or who or who its parents were. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. What matters is my selection. for my purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what holiness is. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. That's a simplicity of it. So in this case, you are sanctified by Christ because you have been elected for a purpose. You want to get baptized, first thing in your mind is you've got to know you didn't choose to get baptized because you suddenly had this epiphany, this great idea. This is something I should do. it will make my life better. No, this is only happening to you because you have been feeling the election of God because his holy spirit has been brooding over you. Something has been calling you. Something has been tugging at you. And if you feel that it's going to push you, it's going to make you realize there is something about you that has been chosen. We have explained that sanctification does not mean you will not have errors. I'm going to read the quotes today. It doesn't mean you won't have errors. It doesn't mean that um or rather it it means there is a calling on your life. Sanctification means you have a calling on your life. Walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called. Ephesians 4:1. you uh uh in in Romans 8, it tells you you have been called. All things work together for the good to them that are called to them that love God and are called. They are called. There is a calling on your life. You're not here because you had a great idea that you should be in the message. And the thing is that calling is not like you were walking one day in school and you heard Alistister Mark. You're expecting Moses. [Music] No, it's it's so far from that. It's not. Sometimes we wish it was like that, &gt;&gt; you know, then we like be sure. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But look at Moses. He actually had that calling and said, "You're making a mistake." Well, what makes you think you'll be different? H um half of you, probably all of you, Lord, just speak to me. Just tell me what to do. And you're so confident in yourself. You're such a good person that if God actually told you by an audible voice that you would actually do it. We have proof in the Bible that a man is called by a burning bush, pillar of fire, supernatural voice speaking to him and still he's disobedient. What makes you think you're better than Moses? &gt;&gt; So it means there is a calling on your life to be used of the word of God and for the purpose of Christ. And if you're coming to sanctification, it means you have recognized the calling. Don't be ashamed of that. Don't be ashamed to say that. I've recognized I feel I believe I am called by him. All right. So, we get to this other part cleansing. To cleanse. Um, for those of you who know English, the word cleanse comes from the word the root word clean. Amen. Now this is where we have the problem because people's interpretation of clean uh you know oh it's a it's a clean life you know I watched this movie it was a clean movie clean why it didn't have this it didn't have that it didn't have that you know it didn't have violence it didn't have sexuality didn't have swearing so it's a clean movie it had a whole lot of ideology ology cleanse coming from the word cle in the original words of the Bible it means purging. The literal word is pur. &gt;&gt; Purge from the uh European languages. Purge to clean, right? And purge and and and also to purify. Both coming from the same root words. The two words are so similar. But purging is an action that requires taking something contaminated out of something. So, in other words, like when you're purging something, meaning you're cleaning something, something dirty at home, some dish that you cooked in, or maybe um I don't know, your barbecue stand after you've used it, and you're using detergents to break down difficult and stubborn substances, right? So, you need like some kind of detergent to purge something, right? In other words, so um using something else to clean something else. Am I breaking it down? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right now, usually there's some kind of purging agent that is required to break down a stubborn contaminants. But purifying means So that's purging. Purifying means to remove impurities. &gt;&gt; Pure. Okay, I love that because in other words, there's something about me that is pure. There's a pure me somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's just some impurities inside that if it was just taken out, &gt;&gt; I'd be a pure substance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love that thought. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So, for example, if you purify gold, like you take a a clump of rock with gold in that rock and you take a hammer at it. First, you're going to break down whatever chunks of dirt and rock and stone and it'll just fall away. Then, you take this gold and you put it in a furnace, right? And then it's going to melt. The gold is going to melt. And when gold melts, all the solid rock and different impurities start to rise to the surface. Right? So it means what we're saying is there's gold there but in the gold there are particles and clumps of other substances that is not gold. &gt;&gt; So to make it pure gold you have to remove everything from it that is not gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So the purpose of cleansing now remember Christ gave himself to sanctify and cleanse. &gt;&gt; Amen. by the washing of the water by the word. So why are we so invested in the word? Because the word is the thing that can wash you, that can bring cleansing, that can bring sanctification. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not church, not religion, the word. &gt;&gt; A lot of people can have church and no word. And if you have no word, you have no sanctification and no cleansing. &gt;&gt; You just have religion. Right? So, I feel like a lot of us tend to put a pause on God's process of cleansing and we don't realize how it affects our uh us or our effectuality. You are literally gold and you've got impurities stuck inside. As long as you still have impurities stuck inside, you can't be effectually used. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the purpose of cleansing and purification for you as an individual and you need to understand it, you need to appreciate it, right? And this is why I say it's going to help a lot of us because a lot of us are waterbaptized 20 something years ago or 30 years ago and then we forgot that we were we were chosen. We forgot that we were selected to be holy and we we kind of paused the the sanctification or the cleansing process. We stopped allowing him to remove the clumps of impurities out of us. &gt;&gt; And so we are being used in some way but not to its full effectualness. In other words, for you to be used in an optimum level of ability, it would be necessary to remove all impurities and substances or let's make it clear characteristics about you personally that do not comply with the purpose of God. For example, if you were a person who was impatient, and I'm using this the silliest one, and you are impatient, you're callous. In other words, you're a person who's just so impulsive, you just want to do something and you just can't wait. Right? If you you get this thought in your mind, you just want to do it without understanding or taking some cognizance of the risks behind. You're just an impatient person. And God has called you and he puts you through a cleansing experience. And he puts you through an experience to get the nature out of you. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, if you want to purify gold, it takes heat. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You got to take the heat, &gt;&gt; right? And so God put you through this cleansing. In other words, you're going through some experience in your life that's knocking you. If you were not selected, you wouldn't be going through it. &gt;&gt; If you were not sanctified to him, you would you would not be going. You would probably be enjoying that bad characteristic you've been living with for so long. And nobody's going to tell you a thing. Would go on in the world and that thing would would amplify itself through your life. And you might even become the CEO of some great Fortune 500 company and who cares, right? And you got there with that clump of impurity cuz that's what it takes. You can't tell me you become a businessman without being a cheat. I mean, I'm sorry. You know what you're doing. You get up there and you're earning millions and billions. You've lied. You've cheated. You've broken all the rules. There's no way anyone who sticks with all the rules gets that rich. &gt;&gt; Impossible. Right. In this country, by the way, our um you've got simple people here in Durban and we know everybody, right? You don't become multi-millionaire here in Durban without having been involved in drugs. No, all those little copper shops and stuff, they were all fronts. There was drugs happening behind illegal trade and and then that was I'm talking about generations back and then it's passed down to the sons and then passed down to this one and that one. Now they are multi-million dollar companies and stuff, but it all started with drugs and illegal stuff. We know them. We know the families. We know how it got to the place that is now. They're like this accounting firm. It started with drugs. &gt;&gt; It's amazing. Uh if you're a straight button person, straight shooter, it's very hard for you to rise up that high in this world. &gt;&gt; It's almost impossible. &gt;&gt; Don't don't differ with me. The Lord Jesus says that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. Or that's what he implies in the scripture. So what I'm saying to you is every one of us has these characteristics in us that they are clumps of impurities that's not conducive to the holiness of God to the purpose of God. Are you with me? So you know um how can you deal? So if if you're a person coming back to the person who's impatient and God has called you to his purpose to save souls to deal with people if you're an impatient person how are you going to bring souls to Christ? Because people, man, they can really test your patience. Because anything that can test your patience is people, right? And and you are entering a training field, which means God is going to put you through the test to make you patient. And how can you deal with problematic people if you are impatient? And that is just one attribute. Most people who come to Christ and you know, they say, "I've converted. I've become a Christian." Many times they think of cleansing and sanctification. God took me away from drinking and smoking and drugs and cursing and fornication and those kind of things. And thank the Lord, he took me away from that. But uh if I had to describe it, if you take a whole rock and there's gold inside and then you start heating it up and then what rises to the top, all those big chunks that you can just scoop away with a with a ladle, that's like drinking, smoking, fornication, those are big chunks of rocks. And then when all those things are gone, you think, "Yes, I'm sanctified." No, there's all these little particles inside &gt;&gt; that if you don't get it out, it will fracture the gold. &gt;&gt; And those little ones are the ones you don't want to get rid of. Those are the ones you're proud of. Those are the ones God made me this way. &gt;&gt; Right? So, if I had to describe it, I would say those things, drinking, smoking, those are the easiest things to get rid of in the refiner's fire. It's like if you find a clump of gold, in the moment you put it in the furnace, the heavy chunks rise to the top, you scoop it out, but the tiny specks of impurity. And a lot of times there's lookalike gold, too. And it requires a process, a deeper process of the refiner's fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a lot of things in us that uh is lookalike gold and we glorify it and we think it is and we think we can use that for God's purpose and he's not interested in that. He wants to burn that thing out. &gt;&gt; He's got to purify it. Amen. So we get to this part where there are two processes of Christ's purpose in giving his life in shedding his blood for the church. Sanctification and cleansing. Notice we are not sanctified and cleansed by the literal blood of Christ. We are here 225 years or so after the Lord Jesus Christ. Give or take a few years maybe. We have not seen the literal blood of Christ. Nobody has it. If anyone claims it, they're a liar. Nobody has a drop of the literal blood of Christ. And even if you did, it ain't going to make any difference because it's not that chemistry. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So, you are not cleansed and sanctified by the literal blood. Paul tells us in Ephesians how we are sanctified and cleansed. And it is by the washing of water by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the first thing is you don't understand washing of water by the word. I know this &gt;&gt; because you are not Jewish people &gt;&gt; and that is a Jewish people tradition. &gt;&gt; So what is that? So most people say water baptism but it says washing of water by the word. &gt;&gt; Okay. What does that mean? It's a Jewish custom. We spoke about this recently recently when I think it could have been a Wednesday night. I did a question and answer. I'm not can't remember now, but remember we were talking about Aaron and his sons being washed by the prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. This is where it comes from. Aaron and his sons were washed by Moses in their linen garments at the tabernacle from the brazen labor of water. Okay, what does that mean to you? So this statement by the washing of the water by the word is a statement referring to that Jewish symbol. Right? So people, Christians today have just taken this water baptism thing and don't understand anything. &gt;&gt; Everybody gets baptized. You get these little babies, they bring them before this dish, they gunk them in, some of them sprinkle them, and it's a family thing. And or you get baptized, you get confirmed or something, and you go out and become an absolute rascal, man. Even the worst leaders of drug cartels are properly baptized. Huh? They'll be going there to to shoot up a whole place and they'll be busy crossing themselves. Lord, give us the grace to kill all these people so we can get rich. That's how crazy they are. They don't understand water baptism. They don't understand washing of the water by the word. Why? because it's a Jewish custom which became a symbol in the scripture to teach us something. So that was a what was the tradition? What was the whole idea the symbolism of Aaron being washed by the prophet? It was simply this Aaron who used to be who was of the tribe of Levi, the brother of Moses. He was leading the people with Moses from uh he he was this man who was the older brother of Moses. He was uh he was uh speaking to the people and convincing them of Moses ministry. He was helping Moses with on the route towards the promised land. And he was this slave in in Goan. He wasn't a regular man. He had ambitions. Maybe he wanted to have a few kids. He had a few kids. He had some sons. He probably want to think, well, when we get to the promised land, I, you know, I picked up some some uh skills in Goan, you know, I'm I'm some kind of builder, you know, and I I fashion some I want to open up a business. I I've got all these um great talents, you know, and I'm just waiting for Moses to get us to a place and I'm going to I'm going to do what God has called me, you know, given me these gifts. I'm so good. Maybe I'm a I'm a carpenter. Maybe I'm a builder. Maybe I'm a stonemason. And Aaron has all these um these these talents, these gifts. And God says, "No, you are being chosen for the priesthood. You are being called for the priesthood. The washing of the water by the word is a symbol of what? Washing away all thoughts of what he thought his life should be. It's called the waters of separation. Separation from what? Not people, right? It's an ancient tradition, not a modern day one. So it is something that is foreign to us and uh this is where the ritual of water baptism comes from. So when those people came to Christ and they were being water baptized they were being baptized by Peter and James and John and all the disciples what was the baptism signify? We are separating ourselves from our previous self to accept a new self chosen and elected by God. When you come to water baptism, you are conscious of the separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not a se you're still going to be in Durban. &gt;&gt; You're still going to be in the same house. You're still going to be doing the same job. You're still going to be going to the same school. You're still going to be called by the same name. But you need to be separated from all previous or past self. &gt;&gt; And realize you have been called to a new self. &gt;&gt; Amen. How are you going to know that? How are you going to know that without the word? That's why it's a washing of water by the word. Amen. So if we had to make this plain, we are saying that the act of washing Aaron in pure water indicated that all that was Aaron is no more and a new Aaron is being presented. That is what washing of water by the word means. Separating the old Aaron and presenting a new Aaron. So all this man's dreams, all his ambitions, all his gifts, it doesn't matter if he was a stonemason. Doesn't matter if he was a carpenter. It doesn't matter if he if he had some ambitions to have a fields and a farm and all kinds of career. Right now he's going to be dressed in something he never dreamed of. the miter, the breastplate, the linen garments, the pomegranates and bells, the the purple and the scarlet and the blue, and um he's going to be baking showbread. He's going to be uh cleaning up seven golden candlesticks and uh putting incense upon an altar and and risking his life to take blood into the holy place. He never dreamed of that. He was called to that. He then had to live his life dedicated to that selection. This is a new errand he never dreamed of. This Aaron could only be revealed by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He would never know what to separate himself from to Amen. If the word was not made known, if we had to make this plain, Aaron was being separated from a previous Aaron to a new era. So when you come to water baptism, you recognize what the washing of the water by the word is. Young people, you are choosing to be what God wants you to be and not your previous self. by the word. The phrase by the word. So in the scripture Paul tells us that it is the word that separates us, sanctifies us and cleanses us. So we again again uh Christians, some Christian denominations have this pure water thing. There's no pure water. You can bless it how many times? You can say a prayer over it, but the person who prayed over it could be contaminated. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you could say words over it, but the words that were spoken could have been contaminated. There is no pure water, &gt;&gt; right? Can you How do we know this? Elijah told that fellow non to go dip in Jordan and he said, "Of all the rivers, the cleaner rivers, you make me go to that one." It actually proved there was nothing to the water. It was his revelation &gt;&gt; in the word of the prophet. Could you follow the word of the prophet? It had nothing to do with the water. &gt;&gt; Imagine by the filthiest water, but by the word he could be cleansed of leprosy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul tells us it is the word that separates us, sanctifies, cleanses us. So we have no pure water. That's a fallacy. Don't ever think, listen people, I don't care whether you go to Israel and come back with a bottle of water from the Jordan or the Dead Sea or sand from some place or I don't know somebody's some hair from the tomb or a rock from somewhere. There is no amulets in the mage. There's no talismans. There's no substances with supernatural powers on it. &gt;&gt; It's all to do with your faith. You can take a prayer handkerchief. It'll work for one person with faith and it'll not work for another person without faith. &gt;&gt; There are no talismans. Don't place faith in those things. That's superstitious natures. We don't have a literal blood of Christ. We do not have holy oil. We need to move away from things like that. If you don't recognize the word as your capstone and you're placing faith in other substances blessed by other men, you have not yet tapped into the open book. &gt;&gt; This is purely a spiritual experience that can only happen in the human soul if it makes contact with the revealed word for your day. And if you have been called to it, there would there would be no way Noah would have said, I feel like building an ark because I feel something is going to happen. There's no way you can commit yourself to a life unless the word reveals it to you. &gt;&gt; It has to be by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. There may be people who will go through the tradition of baptism but not called by the word. They just do it for a form of religion. It has to be the word. The baptism of water must be an expression that in other words those of you wanting to get baptized the baptism that you are going to have is your outward expression that the word has come to you &gt;&gt; and you have taken it in and you've recognized an old self that you need to be separated from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise don't do it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is the reason that any form of Christianity without the word is powerless. &gt;&gt; Any gathering of the message without the revealed word for your day is powerless. &gt;&gt; It shall not work anymore. No matter how many times you say the prophet's name, &gt;&gt; true. &gt;&gt; Because if it is without the revealed word, it has no power. &gt;&gt; It might look attractive. It might sound anointed. Anything can sound anointed, &gt;&gt; right? You have a charismatic nature, you can make it sound anointed. It can be entertaining. It can be charismatic. But in the end, if it is not the word for your day, it cannot fully separate you from other purposes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It cannot be a washing of water. &gt;&gt; It cannot be a separation for any other purpose. it it won't even engage you into your new purpose because it has no revelation in it and it's not really the word for your day. How could Martin Luther of the Catholic Church do you even know what that feels like? You know, when when I think of people in the message today who are speaking against me, you know, and what am I supposed to now go and mope around and feel depressed? I can tell you right now I'm in my my right mind and I'm telling you right now whatever ministers or people speak against me is nothing compared to what Martin Luther went through. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I can't go get depressed because someone insults me when a man like Martin Luther was chased off across the country and had the guts to go and nail a 95 thesis on the Catholic door knowing there's going to be an army chasing him and I'm going to be moping because someone spoke against me on social media. Then I'm being the exact snowflake that I preach against. Right? So in the end it's if it's not the word it cannot separate you. If Martin Luther did not get the word that just shall live by faith. There's no way he could have made this earthmoving decision to separate from a previous Luther to a new Luther and Wesley the same. And every single one of them. &gt;&gt; It had to take the revelation of the word. That is the washing of water. &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to have that. So, young people, please understand. Uh I just want to say this before we go to the next uh part of this. You must understand that in this world there are so much that you are consuming in your mind today in terms of what people say, in terms of what people teach, in terms of the message, in terms of the media, in terms of uh anything that's occurring in this world and your mind is being filled with word. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; your mind is being trained, your mind is being coached to make you to form you into a certain person. But if it's not the word of God, it's filling you with chunks of impurities. &gt;&gt; It's filling you up with an idea of what you think you should be. And if God is calling you, I can tell you 100%. That's not going to help you. You need to see the word of God for your day and what he's called you for your day. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's go to the two baptisms. Okay? So, and we'll start with the baptism of water. So there's the two baptisms. Now where's this from? This is from John the Baptist. John the Baptist said, "I baptize you with water unto repentance. But he is coming and he is going to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire." So two baptisms, right? Water baptism and baptism of Holy Ghost and fire. So I'm I'm going to start with water baptism because that's what brother asked me to speak to you about. And those of you sitting here thinking, I've already been baptized. Why do I need to listen to this? Trust me, you need to listen to this. So when we look at the first scripture we read, Matthew 3:11-12, that the words of John the Baptist here telling us of these two baptism is quite amazing. He explains how listen I've been baptized many years ago. I lived in this message many years for many years of my life and then I became a preacher and a pastor and still I'm fascinated by this. Right? So I don't think you should be ever thinking I don't need to listen to this. This is important for all of us. John the Baptist explains how that it is his duty to baptize you with water unto repentance. So let's understand this. His job was to prepare the people for the coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; Right? Okay. So everyone clear. I want us to be clear. I want to please don't sleep on me. Let's be crystal clear what John the Baptist is about cuz I feel like a lot of people put very little importance on their baptism. Not really considering it. Okay. So he emphasizes that he baptized with water unto repentance and he was the one preparing them to recognize the coming of Christ. That's huge &gt;&gt; because that's what the prophet of this day was also doing, &gt;&gt; right? And so what was he getting them to repent of? That's what's important. See, he wants them to recognize the coming of Christ. He wants them to repent of their previous understandings of the coming of Christ, &gt;&gt; of all their expectations. &gt;&gt; You've got to repent from that. You've got to change from that. You've got to put that right. You've got to be washed by the water of the word that John the Baptist was preaching and come to the literal water baptism to express that you believe his word. &gt;&gt; So let's explain that to you. His job to prepare them for the coming of Christ. And his message, John the Baptist message was that the Messiah is among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's going to reveal himself at the time he has chosen. He is among us. Oh, wake up people. Put yourself in those people's shoes. His message was also to tell the people that in their present condition with the Messiah being among them, they would not recognize him. because of their present condition. If he reveals himself, they will not recognize him. You know, I think very people understand the gravity of John the Baptist's message. Every one of us hears brother man talk about oh you know a guy wild man lived in the desert you know uh ate wild locust and honey and dressed in skins and came out rugged smelly and with a beard and his hair not combed and shouted at the people and spoke and we all looked at him thinking yeah you know what evangelist you know he was calling people to repent from the evil ways and no he had a message his message was I am here to introduce the Messiah The Holy Spirit has revealed that to me. I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord. We quote that scripture and don't understand what his message really was. His message was the Messiah is here with me &gt;&gt; among us and in your present condition. You will not recognize him if you remain this way. &gt;&gt; That was his message. That was the word that would wash them. &gt;&gt; The baptism was only the expression of that word. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So it was his message that would then his message would give them the ability. If they accepted his message and were washed by it, then they would see him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; So what was the need for him doing a baptism? And what do the people have to repent of? So, was it really about their human errors or unrighteousness? Or of course there is some there is some of that. I mean, if you're a person that's enjoying yourself in unrighteousness, when the Messiah comes, you'll be so hooked up with your unrighteousness, you'll not go listen to his message. &gt;&gt; There is that, right? But unfortunately, there's a lot more than that. John's message of repentance was actually that they all knew about the that that all they knew about the Messiah previously was wrong. How do we know that? &gt;&gt; It was wrong. What they were expecting was wrong. And it was so wrong that if he revealed himself before them, they wouldn't accept it. &gt;&gt; And we know this because even the ministry of that day came to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And asked him, "Are you the Messiah?" &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So in itself, him being questioned by the ministry &gt;&gt; proves he was right. His message was right. They were unsure of what the Messiah would be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the point of them asking him, tell us plainly, "Are you that prophet or are you him?" So his message proved the point. &gt;&gt; You love him saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it was definitely the question of the day because when Christ came, they asked Christ the same question. And here are these two. I love this so much. Here are these two in the same time getting the same question. And they are both speaking the word that they are meant to speak. He's preparing the way for them. He's telling them, "Do you know who that is?" &gt;&gt; And they're both, all the people are asking them, "Are you are you him? Are you him?" And the point was proved that they were so messed up in their minds, they could not tell who the Messiah was. &gt;&gt; He was right. So some people thought John the Baptist was the Messiah, and some of them began to respect him. So this is what happened and I really want you to wake up to this. While Christ was there and preaching, John still had his own disciples &gt;&gt; who were not following Jesus. &gt;&gt; How do we know this? Because some disciples left John and went to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; Why? Because even those disciples of John were nervous of who Jesus was. He was doing things and acting in ways that they even following John the Baptist message had not really given up their previous ideas. &gt;&gt; This is what we've got today. We have a whole lot of brandites &gt;&gt; who have not gotten into the opening of the seventh seal &gt;&gt; who do not recognize the coming of the Lord who cannot see the Messiah among them. And no, that's not a man. That's not brother so and so. That's not apostle so and so. That's not prophet so and so. If you don't know what the Messiah is, if you don't know what William Brandham was introducing, you will not be able to see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; William Brandham was introducing the Messiah. &gt;&gt; What is the Messiah? The word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's how simple the message is. So John's message of repentance was that they had to get rid of all that they had previously believed and and previously taught. They had to relinquish it. They had to put it away from them and forsake everything that they knew as false. You come to water baptism, you put away everything you previously knew. You make it known in your mind. All that I previously knew was false. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I am willing to accept the word. I believe the word even though I cannot explain everything. Even though I don't know the meaning of all things, I accept I can see that the way I was looking at things was wrong. And you have the washing of water by the word. In other words, a separation from my previous self. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they had to relinquish it. Many of them did. They put it away from them. They forsook everything. They literally, again, because we're sitting here in 2025 and we don't know what those people went through, they had to go to their rabbis. They were baptized by a rabbi, a respected man in their village in their suburb. They had to go to the rabbi and say, "I am leaving. I am following John." &gt;&gt; Can do you even know what that must have been like? water a young man coming to his father who supports the rabbi in their street and the father is saying you are my oldest son you want to follow that guy at the river shouting we don't even know where he came from we don't know and this rabbi baptized you when you were a baby this rabbi blessed you for us this rabbi was the one who helped us name you and you have forsaken him you Well, don't just read your Bible. Enjoy your Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you read those stories, let your mind go into that time. Think of those cobbled streets. Think of the life that was there. Read a read a scripture and and meditate on it. Read a scripture and dream on it. Think of what it was. Think of what it was for those people in John the Baptist's day to have to give up their previous thought and come to the waters of separation. Think long on it. Spend a day on thinking on it. You will be so inspired. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can enjoy every verse in the scripture like that. &gt;&gt; Let alone the message. Praise be to God. That believer would have to reject the words of the ministry for his day and leave from following rabbis and Pharisees and Sadducees. Do you know why Pharisees and Sadducees were getting so upset? They were losing members. They were losing following. &gt;&gt; They were losing credibility and they had to come out of the shadows into the public because their members were now standing on the banks of the river. They had to come show themselves. And you had men like Nicodemus come by night. So he's not found out. This has been happening for a long time. You have no idea how many Nicodemuses there are today. It's incredible when I mean come by night. They don't eventually you get some who, you know, like, "Yeah, but I have to stay with my pastor what my pastor said." But I absolutely see what you're saying, brother. I believe what you're preaching is the truth. But what can I do? You haven't accepted the washing of water by the word. &gt;&gt; If if you're in a place where they're preaching the seven seal is closed or everything is for the future and the thunders is for the future and Revelations 10 is for the future, my friend, you have not come yet to the washing of water by the word. You have not even recognized the messenger's message that you must repent of that. &gt;&gt; The symbolism of John's water baptism. He openly confesses. The symbol symbolism of it was he was to wash them with water but only because they believed in his message. Amen. They had to believe in his message first to accept the baptism. Are you with us? So to be baptized of John I meant they confessed at they confessed that any other message was not for them and they were wholly dedicating themselves to John message in anticipation of meeting the Messiah himself. That is how waters of separation young people that's what water baptism means. If you're coming to water of baptism, then you're saying, "Brother Al, I accept everything that I once knew about Christ. everything that I once knew or doesn't matter who you are, young people, old people, I'm coming to Christ and I believe that the message of the hour is the only true revelation of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and I will not question it &gt;&gt; because I have tested everything else. I've seen what it says. There's a lot of things I don't understand, but I am willing to take it by faith. &gt;&gt; Why? Why? What is the calling? What is inside? Because you believe that by being washed by the water of the word, it's going to separate me from something that's going to have a promise in it that I will see Christ, the word made flesh in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the Christ that is being revealed to me in this day. That's what John of our day was pointing me to. I believe that this message is the only thing that will allow me to see the word made flesh in me &gt;&gt; which is Christ promised for this day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this life and uh you know you and I grow up believing and trusting in systems of the world. We are educated by curriculums set by our government and and decided by leaders of our social systems in this world. We therefore have so much indoctrination of things and ideas of life and that are in direct opposition. There are you know this beautiful message brother preaches called uncertain sound where he says everything is uncertain. He talks about home life. You read it &gt;&gt; politics education science everything is uncertain and the amount that is being pushed. Do you know in the prophet's day most the women were not educated which means most of the women were not going to argue with the word right most of the young people were not educated up to grade six brother Mary himself which means under that time most of those people were not going to use science education politics to argue with the word they would come in they would recognize the baptism of the Holy Ghost they would recognize the and accept it and follow and listen and adear to it and not what about this and what about this and what about that and what about this. Today we literally have young people who have not even learned anything yet in life arguing with a 60-year-old preacher as if they know more. It's incredible. You would even have young people in the message proving the prophet wrong about things in his time that they haven't lived in. &gt;&gt; I just want to say it. How stupid is that? &gt;&gt; You haven't You were not there in World War II. You were not there when World War I was taking place. What do you know? You know what Wikipedia told you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know what somebody else reported about what somebody else reported about what somebody else reported. And you say, "I got the links." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I got the source. Those sources were not even there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just because they they are in the internet with blue lines underneath doesn't mean it's the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were not there. &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, but there's documents. &gt;&gt; Documents are written by people. &gt;&gt; People are liars by nature. People will do anything. Documents prove not. Oh, but there signatures. Come on. As if you've never seen signatures being forged. as if you've never seen signatures being put on something because they were coerced for something. &gt;&gt; Is there if if you if you read uncertain sound, you'll know everything that looks like it's perfectly sound is uncertain. You know, when you have to when you have to come with backup and proof and stacks of papers and links and sources and then I know you're not sure. &gt;&gt; That's how not sure you are because you needed all that to be able to tell the truth. You didn't have the spirit to discern. You come. This is what this is what this is about. By the way, what I'm telling you is not relevant. The whole point of this is you are called to go to a world to tell them the word of God. In the time that you are speaking the word of God to another soul, what sources, links, and papers do you have? What proof do you have? If there isn't a consecrated life behind the words that you are speaking and a baptism of the Holy Ghost giving you utterance, you can have all the papers, all the books, all the quotes, all the scriptures. It's meaningless. That's what this is about. So I believe that the reason you know um at first when you you um you come to Christ and uh you know I what I mean try to do uh what the brother and I were fellowshipping about to try to make the word practical and real. Uh I would say it this way that Christianity and the message of the hour has become more of a hindrance to our human life and existence. If you listen to everything you are being fed by the world, by the media, by education, by science, by comforts of life, let's be honest, the message is a hindrance, right? I mean, we're living in Durban. By summer time, it's going to get blistering hot. Why do we have to dress like this? Why can't we just dress in barely any clothes? It'll be so much more comfortable. You know, why can't we just be casual? The message is so restrictive, you know? Why can't we just Why can't we just Why can't we just &gt;&gt; Come on. I We're living in the same world, aren't we? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh in a time where we've got all this entertainment, we've got all this music and movies and and shopping malls and and entertainment areas and holiday places to go blow our money on. Why can't we just do that? You know, have fun. Why can't we just do that? Why? Because we have been called to a purpose. What are we supposed to do? We just live boring lives stuck in our homes reading the Bible, reading the message. It feels so rest. It feels so wrong. And yet there were men who were called by the same purpose, who left all the entertainment they could have, who left all the lives they dreamed of. And you have an English Bible today because men took it seriously. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You have message books printed in your languages because men before you took it seriously. &gt;&gt; They gave up entertainment. They gave up lives. They gave up families. They gave up time to get those books printed to get the word across the continents. And you sit here saying, "Uh, why can't we just go to the mall and spend time on holidays? And why can't we just be like other people? Why can't we just see that's what you need to get washed from? &gt;&gt; That's the mentality. I'm not saying you can't go on holidays. I'm not saying you can't. Please, you there's days where I tell you you need holidays. We actually close services in December because I feel you need to go take time off with your family. I'm all for that. But as a believer, you must still come back to the thought that I'm called for a reason. &gt;&gt; You know, we ask you to find the balance. So at first, young people, you're coming to water baptism and the message feels restrictor. It feels oppressive. It even feels cumbersome. And we get the feeling like I'm I'm a good person. I can do well without the message. In fact, I don't even need to read the Bible. I'm really a good person. I can just come to the church and listen to the services. I mean, what's the point of studying it? What's the point of, you know, that other young brother in our church, you know, that fellow who recites the scriptures and knows it so well, that goody two shoes, you know, I know the author. &gt;&gt; That's the biggest excuse if I ever heard one. &gt;&gt; I know the author. I know the author. Do you know how much worth and value there is in the book? That the author actually wrote something for you to read &gt;&gt; and you're just happy you know the author and that you're insulting him by not reading his book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't give me that excuse. Please read the book. If you present salvation to the world as an escape route from hell, then a lot of people come to be baptized out of fear. &gt;&gt; And that's the reason I believe we have three kinds of believers in all the churches even in the message. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the majority of people are coming to the message because they're afraid. They've been coerced. They are going to do their best to comply with the religion and what it stipulates or what it demands. And it seems like the church with the strongest and harsher rules look like they are the safest because they are the strictest and they're going to do everything to keep me from going to hell. I believe that people are coerced into the message and Christianity because they are being convinced that they can uh they are being convinced about what they can get out of it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So in other words, you're not coming to be water baptized because you are more concerned with what you can get out of it. You are called for a purpose. And &gt;&gt; if what you get out of it is to sit there and wait for someone to sit on me, &gt;&gt; that's what you are called for. See that? That's what this chair is. It's been selected for me to sit on. So it's not even about what you can get out of it. It's about what you can do for him. &gt;&gt; That's the thing. People are called to the message into Christianity. And and this is what evangelism of Pentecostalism was like. Are you born again? You come to a guy at the bus, he's enjoying reading his magazine, drinking a soda or something. And you come to him, poor guy is having a great day. Was not expecting you to arrive and ask him, "Are you born again?" And he said, "Oh, what do you mean born again?" And then you light up like a neon light. H you don't know what's being born again. Do you know there's a hell, my friend? Yeah, I live through it. I got a wife. You should meet her. You know, and then he's like, "No, no, no. There's a burning hell. There's a devil. There's a there's a end result. Do you know Jesus Christ?" "Yeah, I know Jesus Christ." Right now, while you're speaking to him, so far, you look like a mad man. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But you're depending on your ability to scare him. into choosing Christ for what he can get out of it. &gt;&gt; And that's wrong. &gt;&gt; That may have worked for a time, but it's not going to work today. Cuz how long can you keep scaring somebody? &gt;&gt; Eventually, someone watch the same horror movie, they know how to hide from the scary parts. &gt;&gt; After a while, they're not scared of it. For the life of me, I I listen to some people. I don't know what's the point. You know, they're terrified, but they're addicted to horror movies. I listen to them. I ask them, "What is your problem? You're terrified of it. Why do you keep watching it?" I don't know. It's like, "I've got to keep watching what I'm terrified of. You're insane." [Music] You know? I I don't I don't understand. So, people agree. This is what I'm saying. Uh sorry for using that example but people seem to come to church to get terrified. &gt;&gt; The more they get terrified of hell and the bad thing going to happen to them, the more they'll stay. &gt;&gt; And if you don't keep giving them a horror movie from the pullpit, then they're disappointed. &gt;&gt; They didn't get the adrenaline rush and the the dopamine, you know, I watched it, I face it, I'm terrified. Praise the Lord. Hell is scary. Demons, devils, superstition. Uh, you got to pray every day because the demons are going to get, the witches are going to come to me during the night. The wizards are going to cast spells on me. The more you can tell them, the more you can frighten them. What kind of life is that? That's not what you were called for. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I think that was good for a time, the Pentecostal age, if I could say it this way, under John's baptism. &gt;&gt; It was good for a time under John's baptism because many people were needed under John's baptism to get the work to take the work and take it to the world, right? But it's going to take creating opportunities and funding which requires a lot of help from a lot of people. So that's what happened when you were scaring people into coming into the message. You needed their funding. You needed their help. You needed them the numbers to get the messaging out to the world. And then how many of them just fell away but they served their purpose. &gt;&gt; Yeah. The question is from all those saints, I want you to take a sober moment right now. From all those people who came in water baptism, how many actually repented of their individual beliefs and were willing to prepare their hearts to receive the open book? How many people were truly willing to give up their selfishness and their private ideologies of life to be part of Revelations 10:8-11? Yeah. &gt;&gt; To me, I I feel like we're still sitting around. Like Revelations 10:8-11 is like a like a bubble that's moving in front of us and we're waiting for something to happen. I still feel like there's like the stuper moving around message people and they we're just shouting about it and getting excited about it, but nothing's really happening yet. Like you haven't really gotten into it. You got water baptized, but Revelations 10:8-11 is only something to be excited about that God might do for me in the future. &gt;&gt; This tells us what baptism ought to be about. So, those of you wanting to be baptized, listen to these questions. Are you ready? Do you believe that the way of Christ is the only way that your life should be lived? Are you willing to give up any thoughts of a way of life without Christ? Are you willing to make that decision to follow the revealed word for the rest of your life such that there will be no conflict in your soul regarding the purpose of God that he has chosen you for? Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the highest morality in this world today is the word of God? &gt;&gt; Do you believe that as a Christian it will be the greatest honor for your life? Do you believe that Christ came 2,000 years ago and died to make a way for your sin to be forgiven? Will you believe that by believing his word it will do something supernatural to you that will clear you of all guilt, shame and unbelief that set you on a path of unrighteousness before and will now set you on a path of righteousness ahead? Do you believe that the word can do that for you? Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that everything the Bible teaches is the truth of the word of God and nothing is above it? &gt;&gt; Are you willing to take the responsibility of believing the word knowing that you will be persecuted for it? Knowing that you will be teased, knowing that you will be mocked? Are you willing to take the responsibility of believing his word, not thinking of how it will benefit you, but how you will benefit it? &gt;&gt; If you can choose this day that you can make this promise within yourself between you and God, then there's no time like the present. Take the step, express your faith and be water baptized &gt;&gt; by faith. By faith means you are aware that there will be bad days, &gt;&gt; bad times, &gt;&gt; times of failure, times of stress, times of distress, times when family will let you down, times when church will let you down, times when people will let you down. But you will not fail in the promise you have made by faith. When you say you are doing it by faith means you are aware bad times are coming &gt;&gt; and you will still stand. There will be days when you will struggle to understand some things in the word after you are water baptized. There will be days you will have personal problems, problems with family, with people in the message and the church. But you are still taking the step of faith promising that you will not fail to keep believing. &gt;&gt; You can only take the step if the word has already come to you. See, because it takes the washing of water by the word. And you can only take the step if the word has already caught your attention and has separated you from your thinking in your own mind. At this point, at this point, young people, if you want to be water baptized, at this point, I'm not even asking you if you love Jesus Christ yet. Because I know you don't. It's only a figment of your imagination. I'm telling you right now, I'm not even going to ask you, do you love Jesus Christ and make you lie to me? &gt;&gt; Because this is what it's about. You barely know him. His word has come to you and there's a calling on your heart and you know there's something that you can be and what you were is not what you're comfortable with anymore. That's what's happening. I'm not even going to ask you if you love him yet because so far I know you love yourself more. We are still moving. You when you come to water baptism you are still overcome with fileo love. You don't even have an ounce of agape yet. You're still coming to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is going to happen later. Loving him is going to happen later. You can love an idea. You can love the idea of Jesus Christ died for me on Calvary to forgive me of the wrongs that I did. And you can say, you can even cry, but you still don't love him yet. Trust me, there are days coming. It's going to prove whether you love it. &gt;&gt; This day is not that day. The day you get water baptism is not that day. That's you convincing yourself that you might love him. I'm telling you the truth. I was there. I was waterbaptized. But the day that the word really made, you know what, brother brother Albert Green was preaching last week when we were there. That was the revelation in my soul that turned me. When the impression of the word revealed to me that I was in him before the foundation of the world. That was the actual message that turned me. That turned the entire message for me. I remember that moment in my life. I lived in his message. I was baptized with message. I lived the life. I kept the rules. But the day when it turned, when I had that, you mean I was in him before the foundation of the world. And what's inside of me is a part of him. When that became real to me, the entire thing opened up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can't say it's going to be the same for you young people. I can't say you will have the exact same experience. In fact, you might have a completely different experience. But you will know that you can only take the step if God has already caught your attention. So at this point it is the washing of the water by the word. It is water of baptism is the symbolic physical manifestation of this experience. When you so people can come and be baptized and I will baptize them in water. They'll go back. They'll leave the church and call me a devil. and I baptized them. &gt;&gt; They could still do that. So the act of being water baptized is not what does it. It's the washing of water by the word. &gt;&gt; The act of water baptism is something else. It's your outward confession. &gt;&gt; That the word has come to you to separate you. &gt;&gt; Probably the best message to understand is all right. Are you ready for this? Uh the best message I would say and uh a lot of people in the message you know they start this reading this message and then they give up future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride. You know people today you know I'm sure you might know some people who don't like long preaching. You know messages like future home is long preaching. So you get to like page 15 and we're already giving up, you know. All right, let's go to future home. The first step is repentance towards God. And then follows after that is water baptism. Water of baptism, repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus. So he's saying water baptism follows repentance, right? Water of baptism follows showing that repentance was genuine. So you have to have repented. That means changed your mind. &gt;&gt; You have to have changed your thinking. And then what baptism follows. Water baptism shows that repentance was genuine or to remit our past sins. That has nothing to do with future sin. &gt;&gt; Right? Are you listening young people? Are you listening? Water baptism remits past sin. Has nothing to do with future sin. That's telling you after you've been repented and water baptized, all that's happened is you cleared what you have already done. There's still stuff you are going to do. We're aware of that. It only remits. Repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. What for? Remission. Taking away of past sin has nothing to do with the future. Just your sin that you have done has been chopped off. What you did, you can't repent for what Adam done. You never done it. How can you repent for what other people did? Adam did it. You just get forgiveness for what you've done. The old nature is still there. &gt;&gt; This is what I'm saying. This message is what reveals everything to you. I would encourage you to go home, read it. If you parents have children who are knowledgeable teenagers, go through the message, this message with them. I'm give today I'm giving you the start because today two baptisms and three purgings is from this message. So this is telling you several things. We've already been through it. Repentance first, then water baptism, and then you must know all that happens is you are being cleared of things that you've done in the past. It has nothing to do with the future. You are still going to do stuff in the future. Probably the next day after you water baptized, too. Probably the next week, you are still going to do stuff. And for that, you are going to pay while you live. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. You are set free of all. This is a beautiful thing. You've done all the stuff in the past and it's chopped away. You're not paying for that. He's he's cleared you of all the guilt. But thereafter, everything you do because you were chosen to be holy. Everything you do that is against his purpose, you're going to pay for it. And thank God you're going to pay for it while you live. Because when you die, you get your crown of life in glory. &gt;&gt; And you're not going to pay for it in a lake of fire. Your past sins are remitted, not your future sins. And your slate is wiped clean. You are not held. This is what you are to be rejoicing. Especially some of you really live like real devils before, right? Let's be honest. If you did stuff that you should be held accountable for and Christ has wiped your slate clean, you should be whooping and screaming for joy. Thankful that I don't know who you really were before I met you. But it has nothing to do with the future. This is honest. I love this. This is so honest. There's nothing. Brother Brandham is not sugar coating it. He's not telling you, "Oh, your life is going to be wonderful from here on out. It's going to be awesome. No, it's got nothing. He's telling you so honest. Your old nature is still there. &gt;&gt; Your future. This has got nothing to do with the future. Um, how are you going to be held accountable for future unrighteousness? That's where the church comes in. So, those of you who think, I can just listen to the tapes. I can just stay home. I can just I don't I can just, you know, read the own my own books. This is what the church is for. If you didn't know what the church is for, now I'm telling you. Now that I'm telling you and you know, you're accountable. Okay, I like saying that. We are commissioned by God to bind and loose. We have been given the power by God, all of us as a church to bind and loose. That means we are here to hold you accountable for your future mistakes, failures and errors. We are here to help you find judgment. We are here to help you find forgiveness. We are here to help you put all future mistakes and errors right. That's what we are all chosen for. That's why we are a body. A church that doesn't help you reconcile is not fulfilling its purpose. A church that doesn't bring you to forgiveness and back to full value is not fulfilling its purpose. What purpose? To bind and loose, to judge, to legislate, to administer grace. So you were baptized in water. Your past sins were forgiven. It was remitted. We don't even think about it. We don't hold it against you. Nobody does. It's your conscience is clear but everything you do thereafter you have us to reckon with. God has purposed it that you have us to reckon with. If you hide things from us we can't do anything. If you confess it we can do something. We can bring you to repentance. We can bring you back to your full value. That's what we are here for. It is important to know this. When you get baptized, young people, when you get baptized, you must have full confidence in Brother L and your church that if you do something wrong, if you mess up your lives, we are here to help you. Do not be ashamed. Do not feel afraid of us. If you can't tell us, who can you tell? Where else are you going to find grace? Where else are there people who will still accept you for the mistakes you make? who will still have you to fellowship among us, share the word with us. Where else will you find people who will not look at your sin and accept you as a soul moving along with us to this glorious body change? Where else will you find people your own spouse will speak against you? Your children will will revile you. Your cousins, your families, they'll all hold you and and say you're a hypocrite. We'll never do that. And yet we'll tell you, brother, sister, you need to make it right. We'll tell you this is the right thing to do. You have to confess it. You have to face up to it. We'll tell you the right thing to do here is face the music, but we'll stand with you. We're here with you. It's going to be hard. It's going to be tough. They're going to hate you. But we're here with you. Know that God doesn't hate you. God's not against you. We're here for you, young people. If you falter after you water baptize, we're here for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have a promise from us. As long as you stay with the word, we cannot throw you away. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; But you've got to put the work in. &gt;&gt; You've got to come to church. You've got to read the gospel. You've got to become tougher in the word, stronger in the revelation. Amen. You've got to show care for your other people because you are also going to be a part of it when other people falter. You have to be there for them. &gt;&gt; Your old nature is still there. That's why you may still fall into snares and cause serious failures somewhere in your journey in your life after you are water baptized. It's not a magic moment. It is to some degree. Amen. I I tell you, every person who who has been through the water of baptism, you come out with an amazing feeling. I won't take that away from you. It's amazing, right? And there's so much of And the most amazing is all these people looking at you so happy for you. And you're walking out, you're drenched, you look like a bedraggled wet dog, you know, you come out of the water, you're sheepish, you're pulling your clothes on you, they put a towel around, they're singing songs, they're so praising God, her soul has been brought into heaven, and you're walking through there. Saints, the feeling is amazing &gt;&gt; because these you've just been inducted into the body of these people. These people are so happy you're one of them. Brings us to a very important point. Being baptized in the right name. Let's read a quote from future home of the heavenly bridegroom. Paragraph 111. Future home. &gt;&gt; Brother Mson, are you still listening? Listen carefully. See, the heart has to be cleansed like that. Before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost, which is Christ coming down and dwell in the human heart, it must it first must be repented. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; It must be baptized in water in his name to show who it belongs to. &gt;&gt; So, you're not going to escape water baptism, young people. When you do it, it shows who your heart belongs to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Being water baptized is showing who your heart belongs to. What does that mean? There's so many beautiful nuggets of statements in the message that I can read to you. There's thousands. I just don't have the time to do that. But what does it mean that who your heart belongs to, you know? Almost like when you give an engagement ring to a young girl or she gives one to you, you know, whatever, vice versa. And she walks around or he walks around with that ring on their finger. That's a token that I belong to someone else. You see that? That's what your baptism is. You It's your token to God to say, "I belong to you. You belong to me." It shows who your heart. There must be an expression to say who my heart belongs to. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, as children who grew up in the message, you still with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We saw our parents make a big deal about being baptized in the name of Jesus, right? How many of you here had parents in the message? Raise your hand. Don't be afraid. I only bite on Fridays. Okay, I'm just kidding. Uh so you know you've had parents in the message you remember the times where your parents talked about being baptized in the name of Jesus and father son and holy ghost and trinity versus wonders and you remember that the there was this great hype about that right and uh you can't be the trinitarian way and the name of the father the name of the son the name of the holy ghost it was the name of Jesus and they made a big deal about that it was good enough for a time because it was a traditional thing to do to draw people into the bride church away from denominational systems. It was great. But today you are called to a capstone. You need to get a deeper understanding of the name. &gt;&gt; It's no longer just about not trinity versus oneness or that the name Jesus is it's no longer just that. It's a deeper meaning. I'm just going to say it. Unto what were you baptized? Those of you then that were unto what then were you baptized? Didn't Paul ask that of those people? And they said unto John's baptism. &gt;&gt; Right? So this is the question that fixed why they didn't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said to them, "Why have you not received the Holy Ghost since you believed? Unto what then were you baptized?" So in other words, that's saying, why are you not effective in the purpose of the open book today? &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask it this way. Are were you baptized until God sent a prophet? &gt;&gt; Were you baptized until seven seal not open? &gt;&gt; Because that's going to explain why you don't have the Holy Ghost for today. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why you are ineffectual in your life in the open book? Because you are still baptized unto a name of another day. &gt;&gt; You have to ask yourself these questions because that determines what purpose you were baptized into. See, being baptized in the name of Jesus must not be a tradition. The name of Jesus represents. How many of you know what Jesus actually means? Right? I'm not talking. We're still going to get to that in the name of of God. We spoke about Jesus meaning Jehovah, our savior. But what is what is the concept of Jesus? What is the concept of the word made flesh? What is the mystery of Christ revealed? It is Jesus encapsulates this. The revelation of God made flesh. Let it sink in. Are you So, I'm going to say it this way. Are you baptized in the name of the revelation of God made flesh? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you committed to that name? That you believe that the word can be made flesh? &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you, if you believe the word can be made flesh, then you believe you can be the word made flesh. And you believe you can be the revelation of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And then if that if you have that belief, you can believe that your brother can be. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That someone else out there can be that. And then you're you're ignited with a fire to tell someone you can be the revelation of God made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the name of Jesus. You must believe unto that name. You know saints when we preach messages from this pulpit and whenever we are we say things we read quotes we read scriptures but we're expecting you to get it. We're expecting the people to get it. Instead we get tied down with ministers being legalistic about quotes and and that's not what we're talking about. We believe this. We know what Jesus is. &gt;&gt; We know what it means for you to be Jesus. Yes, &gt;&gt; you can shout about Mrs. Jesus Christ. Praise be to God. My new name and that's all you have is a slogan. &gt;&gt; That is the name you must know. You young people, what are you being baptized into? &gt;&gt; The revelation of God made flesh. The revealing of the creator. the revealing of the logos of God made flesh. You are being baptized unto that. You are going to be giving up your life for the purpose of that revealing. You are you are being baptized as a confession to give up your lives as a purpose of becoming that to show others that they can become that. &gt;&gt; Amen. That means do you believe that the revelation of God is the word made flesh in Jesus? Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can believe that by faith in that name, then the next step is leading you to the purpose of you becoming the word made flesh. Right? and and and so which is the purpose of God that he made man in the beginning which Adam lost. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire. So because I purposed more to speak on water baptism, you know, this shouldn't take too long. Although this is a massive subject which I cannot do in the service. I I just shared recently with some folks my questions from 2012. There were like 30 some odd questions on the Holy Ghost. Some of you might have even forgotten the questions you gave me. Some of you, if I even mentioned one, you'll ask me, "Brother, please can you preach that series again?" Like question I got, how could a baby receive be filled with the Holy Ghost? John the Baptist in the womb. H see we did those questions we did the answers to those questions and I bet you some of you will be saying where's I want those notes please can you preach that again those are the the the amount of questions we had in the Holy Ghost that we dealt with from 2012 and we did this series for you we preached it in different ways too there about 30 odd questions. So, the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a massive subject. At first, when you read this uh the baptism, right? You take uh sorry, we I don't think we're going to the quotes yet. Okay. &gt;&gt; Baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire, right? So, when John the Baptist said he will come and he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. Are you still with me? Don't worry about the screen. Doesn't it sound a little like there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost and baptism of fire? &gt;&gt; It says he I baptize you with water. He will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire. So it can sound like two, right? Two different baptisms. Baptism of the Holy Ghost and a baptism of fire. The there are two scriptures, one in Matthew, one in Luke that says it exactly the same way. If it were not for the prophet, we would uh not be able to understand this properly. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is a phenomenon that has been questioned and taught for 2,000 years and it was even a point where they kicked it out of the church because it was creating so much of trouble. The clue, are you with me? The clue is the word baptism. Why? Because we already know what baptism of water is, right? So the clue is baptism because what is baptism? The word baptism comes from the word baptismal which means washing or dipping or immersing. Are you with me? So if you are going to be washed, dipped or immersed with the Holy Ghost and with fire, right? So what then is the Holy Ghost and fire that you are being dipped into? What are you what is the Holy Ghost that you are being washed in? What is the fire that you are being washed in? Because it says in Acts 2 uh Pentecostalism rather uh is responsible for a lot of the confusion and the romanticism of the Holy Ghost. Do you know why? Because they kind of thought you remember in Acts two it says and there appeared unto them cloven tongues of fire. &gt;&gt; Remember that? And so they thought that that's the fire that they were baptized with. But how do we know that's not true? Because there are many other people after Acts two received the Holy Ghost who never claimed to see cloven tongues of fire. &gt;&gt; So do they have the Holy Ghost but not the fire? Right? So they also hold the Pentecostals hold people to a standard of seeing tongues of fire. Some of them do. And if not, if you don't, if you say you got the Holy Ghost, you spoke with tongue, but you didn't have tongues of fire, then you have a problem. There was no other record of other people receive or seeing tongues of fire in the Bible. And it's important to understand what the Holy Ghost is to know what it is that you are baptized with. Are you all with me? &gt;&gt; Okay. So, if we had to put it in a way that we can understand, break it down to reality, brother L. Okay. It would be that you will be baptized with the Holy Ghost mixed with fire. Not two separate baptisms. Again, &gt;&gt; you got water baptism and you got bapti baptism with the Holy Ghost mixed with fire. Hold that thought. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; The fire is not real fire. It's not seven-dimensional fire. Uh it it it what brother Bam identifies in the message as zeal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Zeal. Fire is zeal. Brother man identifies. He says it's like when you are baptized with the Holy Ghost, it sets you on fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. It meaning it places a zeal in you to spread the word of God. &gt;&gt; It places a zeal in you for salvation of souls. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people are baptized with the emotions. &gt;&gt; And then they sit. There's no zeal. &gt;&gt; Listen, what is baptism? It's a washing. It's a cleansing. You are cleansed by zeal. A lot of people, you know, when we we talk about purpose from the pulpit and we tell you you have to have a purpose and when we tell young people if you want to overcome sins of the modern day, pornography, social media, all of that, what what is the real It's so logical. What is the real problem? You are stuck sitting on your phones. You have no purpose. You are doing nothing with your life but filling your head with what you see on the internet. You're spending hours and hours and hours on the internet and the the purging of that is purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, where do you get purpose from? Now, here's the the trial of this day, you young people and adults stuck in social media and the and the internet, that thing is holding you back from becoming a guitarist, &gt;&gt; a pianist. an artist, a reader, an engineer, a nuclear physicist, you're literally becoming stupid by putting more knowledge into you. And what knowledge? Irrelevant knowledge. You will waste hours and hours in a day wasting this time putting other stuff in your head that has absolutely nothing to do with the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But this is the challenge of this day. This is what you are going through. Right? And so if if you if you don't even have a cell phone, right? You don't have a cell phone, you don't have internet, but you have TV and you're on TV all the time, then it's the same thing. If you don't have that and you have something else. If it's your work, if you're obsessed with your job, it's the same story. If you're obsessed with your career, it's the same story. Why? You are being absorbed into something. Where is the zeal for souls while you're obsessed with that? So you can have a holy ghost feeling, emotion, anointing, but no zeal. Zeal is what cleanses you. Zeal is the fire. Zeal is what purges. Zeal is what removes those specks of impurities inside that you can't see that cracks the gold. You are supposed to be baptized. So this is the thing. What what am I supposed to do, brother L? What? So now like with our children, if we don't provide the purpose, they'll just sit there. We must make up the the chore list. There's grass that must be raped. There's the patio that must be swept. There's the pool that must be clean. I must set the time. I must set this. I'm You won't do it. You'll walk over the filth in the floor. You'll bypass my car that's looking filthy and won't wash it. You won't do it. You'll spend time on your cell phone and not be interested because you don't have any zeal to make yourself better. Just go wash your dad's car and find out how useless you are even washing a car. You will leave stains on the windows. You will leave soap suds on certain air. You'll wet my seats. You're if you can't even wash a car, but you want to save souls, why can't you wash a car? Cuz you don't do it enough. &gt;&gt; You don't know how to take stains off a car window and make it gleam. You don't know how to use polish on the wheels. You You don't know how to do anything unless I tell you what to do. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz you don't do it. And this is the issue with church people. You're waiting for me to tell you what's wrong with your mouth. Your mouth is good at it other places and other times. [Music] Times we don't need it. What's What's wrong? Why can't you tell other people of your love for the word? What's stopping you? Nothing. You've got an excuse. You're waiting for the church to make a timetable. You're waiting waiting for the church to make a program. You've got zeal. You You've got gifts. You've got abilities. The Holy Ghost has given you abilities. You lacking zeal. And zeal is what cleanses. Zeal is what removes the idle mind. Zeal is what removes idolatry. Zeal is what removes complacency. Don't wait for a child. It's not going to happen. Church programs can only do so much. You literally work with people. You literally work with souls. You literally school with souls. You literally shop where there are souls. You are all over the place with souls you can speak to. &gt;&gt; You despise the Jehovah's Witness. He's doing a lot more than you. This is what Holy Ghost and zeal is. This is why people are still tossed about. This is why people cannot overcome things in their lives. You're sitting around and claiming to have the open book and eating the open book and it's sweet in the mouth, bit in the belly, but you're not fulfilling prophesying to many kindreds, nations, tribes, and &gt;&gt; doubts. Amen. What is the Holy Ghost? We know that the Holy Ghost is the spirit, the divine nature of God that has ordained to be a part of man. Let's read. You want to know question and answers. And you take the Holy Spirit off of a man, he's lower than an animal. He's worse than an animal. That's a hard thing to say, but you take a man that's unregenerated in his mind without the Holy Spirit to direct his thoughts. Don't tell me you don't need the Holy Ghost. What a baptism is not enough. &gt;&gt; This is why every prophet, every holy man in the Old Testament had to be anointed by the Holy Ghost because he had to be able to prophesy. You cannot prophesy without the Holy Ghost. You cannot prophesy true. &gt;&gt; But this Holy Ghost anointing that they had in the Old Testament is not the same anointing in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't care how many people disagree on that. There's thousands of quotes to prove you wrong. The prophet explains us explicitly for those you know how much of attack we've come under because I've made those statements and yet just the legalism over two quotes that where brother man said they're the self same thing the cells same word and yet if you read the token message and everywhere else he said they were under the blood of bulls and goats &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and the blood cell could not break and take the life of the animal to come back. &gt;&gt; He said only after Christ, &gt;&gt; the blood cell broke and the life of Christ could come back upon the believer. That token is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; If that came after Christ, what did they have in the Old Testament? &gt;&gt; Sir, &gt;&gt; you know those quotes, but you get legalistic about two quotes. &gt;&gt; There's hundreds of them and they know that. Therefore, they may have been anointed with the Holy Ghost anointing, but there was an absolute difference before Christ and after Christ. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say. Before Acts chapter 2, listen carefully. John 20 22-23. And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said, this is before Acts chapter 2. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When he had said this, he breathed on them said, "Receive you the Holy Ghost." I literally told them, I read the scripture that said David spake by the Holy Ghost saying, "My Lord said unto the Lord said unto my Lord." I know that. I know they were anointed with the Holy Ghost. But it's very evident what they had was not the same as what they had after Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there was no blood cell broken yet. &gt;&gt; Yes. But here before Acts chapter 2, he tells him, "Receive you the Holy Ghost. Whoever sins you remit is remitted. Whose sins you retain is retained." He, this was before Acts two. What was the Holy Ghost given to them for that purpose? Go and remit and retain sins. After acts two was go take the gospel to the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you have the the blood cell, the life &gt;&gt; of the blood. And you can do this, &gt;&gt; totally different anointing, totally different purpose. But with the Holy Ghost, we have today, we have this purpose and every other purpose that they had in the Old Testament. Everything. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This was before Acts 2. So before Acts 2, they were just anointed for a small purpose. Go and remit sins. Go and retain sins. Every man of the Old Testament went through this. I've already given you examples of Moses, Samson, David, right? They were only like for example, Samson had the Holy Ghost to go and kill Philistines, tear open a lion, be strong, carry the gates of Gaza, kill a thousand with a jawbone of an ass. But then as soon as the purpose was over, it was gone. &gt;&gt; It literally was in the bedroom of a of a harlot. &gt;&gt; When she he went to sleep, she tied up his hair and then Samson, the Philistines are upon you. The spirit of the Lord comes upon him in the room of a harlot and he wakes up and then goes chasing after the Philistines. You try that today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So it tells you the anointing of the Holy Ghost can fall on anyone to make them do a purpose for God that God deems necessary. But this does not mean that they have the person indwelling them or the full true baptism of the Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost has always been about God giving ability to men. So you must be baptized with ability and zeal. &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? It's the ability of God for a purpose. It's the divine you. It's it's given you ability and a gift that you cannot get on your own. &gt;&gt; You with me? &gt;&gt; Acts 1 7 to8. And he said unto them, it is not for you to know the times of season which the p which the father had put in his own power. Yes. &gt;&gt; But you shall receive power. &gt;&gt; Those are two different words. The one power means authority. The other power is dunamis. Right? After that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. Sorry. One power is uh is authority. The other one is ability. You will receive ability. After that the Holy Ghost has come upon you. Ability for what? You shall be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, in Judea, in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the world. Amen. &gt;&gt; You could not be witnesses before Christ's death and resurrection. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of course, that ability comprises many different attributes, but God knows what is necessary. In other words, there's so many attributes in God. You won't be uh baptized with the ability to build an ark out here in the parking lot today. &gt;&gt; You won't be uh um given the ability to open up the Red Sea today. There's no need for it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's a lot of things that there's no need for but there's a need today and you need the Holy Ghost for that need to meet the challenge of the hour. John 7:37-39 in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. We write songs about it. We shout about it. We quote the scripture. Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. What does it mean? The next scripture tells you this speaking of the spirit which they believe they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not given yet. The Holy Ghost has got to do with out of your belly flowing rivers of living water. &gt;&gt; What is that water? The water of separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are given the commission to go and separate people. &gt;&gt; I hope you can get that. The Lord Jesus talking about people thirsting. Let him that is a thirst come unto me. What's his thirsting? There are desperate people out there. People are desperate to hear the word of God. People are suffering in ignorance and under false religions and traditions. He promised his disciples they would receive the answer for thirsty people and it would come out in abundance. Amen. This is what I find shocking. You know being purported by ministers today who are trying to revive the age of Pentecost. The prophet as much as said that they may have had a baptism of the Holy Ghost but they did not have a true baptism of the Holy Ghost. You know that there are quotes on that. Let's read it. If there's a false, if there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost and there's a true baptism of the Holy Ghost, that means there's a false one. Look at this. Pentecost. Pentecost. Pass thy thinking through God's filter, not your denominational dreams, and you will come out with a holy man's taste. The true baptism of the Holy Ghost. There's other places Leodysia has enjoyed anointings of the Holy Ghost saints. Pentecost has enjoyed anointings and they were able to abuse it and they did not achieve oneness with his divine nature. They took the Holy Ghost and put their own nature into it. John 14:26. But the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name. What is my name? The revelation of God made flesh. &gt;&gt; The father will send the ability in my name. &gt;&gt; He shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance. What does it mean? You forgot. No. The word remembrance means consciousness. Whatsoever I said. In other words, because he wants you to take the word to the world, you are going to come into situations where you speak into a person, you've got no idea what to say. The Holy Ghost will put it into you exactly what to say. And you know what? How you taught in the denominations? You repeat the same thing to everybody. &gt;&gt; This doesn't work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With with who God has called. Because with some people, you have to sit with them for days. &gt;&gt; Some people takes five minutes. How are you going to know which is which? Only the Holy Ghost knows because he has called them. See, so it's not just having an answer. It's having the right answer for the person. Remembrance means your present conscience. Do you remember there's another scripture where he says, "Go. Don't even think about what to say because when it's time to say it, I will give you the words. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Just go. Don't even think about how much money you have in your purse. Don't even think about the clothes in your bag. Don't even think about the food you have to eat. When you get there, it'll all work out. &gt;&gt; Zeal. He also says the Holy Ghost is sent by the father in his name. I don't want to uh labor on that. I know there will be, you know, so much more to this we we've dealt with in great detail in 2012, but to make it plain, you have to be baptized with the spirit of God mixed with zeal. And I I'm telling you, after what I'm saying today, there's going to be many of my colleagues in the in the ministry will go back and search the message and combat with this quote and this quote and and resist. But I'm pleading with you. I'm not offend I'm not offended if you disagree with me. I only have a problem with the fact that you what you are doing is causing us to be one step back with our children. I'm not trying to resist the prophet. I'm trying to elevate him. &gt;&gt; The truth is in this day there are people leaving the message. There are people leaving the prophet and these fellas who are sniping at us from the shadows are doing nothing and have no solutions. We are actually the ministers getting the young people attracted to the word and they're sniping at us. I don't get it. In a world where you've got believe the sign and all of these things and you've got all these people coming against taking people away and our ministry is attracting people to the message, you're sniping us. I don't know. I don't get it. You know, to go and correct ministers across your pulpit. What are you doing? What are you teaching your children? ministers need, you know, to somebody sit back and consider if what we are doing is really to contradict the prophet or whether we are actually elevating his message. What are we doing? Are we am I trying to to say the prophet was wrong? No. Actually, what I'm doing is I'm actually telling you what the prophet meant so you don't get confused by what he said. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's get to the quote. Young people, the prophet says there's another message. So, two messages you need to read. You considering taking this step, future home and the token. There's a there's about four token messages, I think, and and and you can read every single one of them or one of them. Your choice. I would say every one, you know. Paragraph 76. Because it could not come upon a human being because the animal life doesn't have a soul. In other words, in the Old Testament, they they they sacrificed bulls and goats and the blood of the bull and the goats poured into the ground, but it's an animal life. He's saying that animal life, that animal doesn't have a soul. Its life cannot come back onto the believer because the believer cannot be made like unto the animal, right? The animal doesn't know that he is naked. He just he doesn't realize sin. It knows none. So therefore it's a living being but not a living soul. Therefore the animal life could not come back upon a human which which is telling you why animal sacrifice is ineffective. Therefore the animal life could not come upon a human life because it didn't have a soul in that life. Now there is a life a blood a life a soul in that life. The soul is the nature of that life. Therefore it had no certain nature. It was it has animal. Therefore, the blood stood for a token that the life had been given. But in this glorious place, under this covenant, there is a difference between the blood and the life. The token for the believer today is the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; not a blood, a chemistry, but it is the Holy Spirit of God. That is the token that God requires of the church today. This is the evidence that there is an absolute difference between the Holy Ghost in the New Testament and the Holy Ghost in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely different. One was under the covenant of animal life. One is under the covenant of the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; While a blood cell could not break and put the life upon a believer when it can. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us they were under the blood of bulls and goats. So saints, brother says the token is a uh sign. The Holy Ghost is the token. You all got that? Where's this coming from? Remember the blood that was applied in the doors and the lintils. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you. &gt;&gt; This is that token. &gt;&gt; Amen. That must be on display. What? The ability given by God and the zeal. Why are you failing? This is the whole point of telling you what purpose really is. Why are you struggling? Why are you backsliding? Because you are sitting around doing nothing for him. &gt;&gt; That what is the token? The seal for souls. &gt;&gt; Let's not beat about the bush. How many people claim to have the anointing of the Holy Ghost and then say seals are not open or that everything is for the future? Does Pentecost have the token because they're getting the same Holy Ghost you're claiming to resurrect? Do they have the token though they speak with tongues of men and of angels? Does Pentecost have a token though they have gifts of healing and prophecy? So, is there a difference between their token and our token? Yes, there is a difference when the life of Christ comes upon you through the Holy Ghost baptism, the true Holy Ghost baptism for the purpose of purging out unbelief from your soul. Glory to God. Which brings me to the last part of this message, the three purgings. Saints in the message the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride which I would encourage every young person saying it again to read this message and study with a pen and a notebook. Okay, got it. Brother Brandon speaks on a phenomenal thought that I have not seen him speak anywhere else. In this message, you will find many statements that will confuse you in your early stage of the message. But I want to point you to one particular thing. It's going to be from paragraph 89 onwards but he speaks about it sporadically in other places right uh one particular thing is that how God redeems the earth parallels how he redeems you &gt;&gt; how he redeems the earth is how he redeems your body &gt;&gt; your person your being three purgings okay let's read paragraph 89 I'm going to go through it fast says let me Just take this board just a minute. So explaining quickly. Brother Brandon takes a board. He draws draws a heart here and he draws a heart there. Said here's a human heart. Here's a human heart. I'm long ways from an artist. Here's a human heart. And here is a human heart. This one over here has a snake in it. That's sin. This one here has a dove in it. That's the Holy Spirit. Here he has a life. Well, this one here, he has malice, hatred, envy. That's what's causing his fellow here. Snake. Well, this one here has love, joy, longsuffering. What does it down here? Now, when you ask or you've forgiven of your sins, you've only done this, taken that away, but the thing that made you do it is still there. &gt;&gt; That's the old root of evil is still. So, in other words, you've come through water baptism. You've repented. You made things right. You confessed. Your sin is taken away. The snake is still there. &gt;&gt; The thing that made you do it is still there, &gt;&gt; right? Got it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, the first washing takes away the sin. You still need the cause to be taken away. Secondly, next quote, paragraph 91. Secondly, comes sanctification. What is sanctification? Sanctification sets our mind in order for holiness. &gt;&gt; To think right. You were waterbaptized. You heard the message. God sent a prophet. You're still not thinking right. To think right. To set your mind in order of holiness. Take it away. Sanctification is a compound Greek word would mean cleaned, set aside for service. See, I didn't make that up. That that's from the message. Everything I tell you is from the message. Sanctification, consecration, cleaned up, set apart for service. service, purpose, purpose, zeal. You being set aside for it. You still don't have the zeal yet. You just prepared. Got it? The next part of 92 comes the baptism of fire and holy ghost that God may dwell in us. So the last part, so up to that point, God is still not even dwelling in you. &gt;&gt; Got it? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, the Holy Ghost comes upon you and God is still not dwelling in you. God is upon you with an anointing, with a seal, with a fire. It's preparing you for God to dwell in you. Hold that thought if you still think because people go on, I got the Holy Ghost. I got God in me. No, you haven't. And the fire of God cleanses our heart and puts the Holy Ghost inside. Then we bring forth the same life that this did because that's in us. Now, how do we know that's the process? How do we know that God still has to come in and dwell in after the fire? Because of the earth. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice how now let's go to the next quote. Proverb 95. Secification. Third, second stage of it. Now, here's what sanctification does. It cleanses the mind, sets the heart, the mind of the heart in the order of holiness, right? In other words, when you are sanctified by the blood, the blood, right? What that does is it cleanses your mind. It makes you think different. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man can repent of his sins and he's still thinking of &gt;&gt; you may be an immoral man, immoral looking woman. He finds he's still there. Maybe he's a drunken. Every time he smells the drink, it's still there. But when he gets sanctified, that cleanses that desire out of him. Listen, sanctification is a process still about purpose. It's pointing you towards something. It's quite simple. I explained this to you before. If you had a gift of carpentry and then you got tuted by somebody who is something in, I don't know, um, metalology. So you worked with wood but now you you've been taught by somebody who works with metal. What's happened? Your your mind has been shifted from carpentry to metal work and all you're doing is getting the knowledge of a future purpose. &gt;&gt; You are being sanctified. You are being set into a new vocation, a new career. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; That's all is happening. Your mind is changing. Your thoughts are being focused. It's how you think. That's what the blood does for you. You're still not there yet. When he gets sanctified, that cleanses the desire out. He can still be tempted to go back to woodwork, but he takes the want of it away. Still, he is not right yet. He is baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire, cleansed, burnt out, cleaned up, then put into service of God. Sanctification only sets you aside for service. So you can come through the waters, you can come through the blood, and you still not serve him. Are you still with me? Future home paragraph 99, brothers. And notice just exactly how that came. The messages come. Martin Luther justification. John Wesley sanctification. Pentecostalism, baptism of the Holy Ghost, the messages that's where can't no be no more ages of it. We're at the end time. Three stages. Do you know brother Barry actually says there's another message. I think it could be the token one of the token messages. He says there's a there's a water age, a blood age, and a holy ghost age. &gt;&gt; Water age, blood age, and a fire age or holy ghost. That's a quote. Go have a look for it. And notice now just the message Martin Luther justification and so on. The message is there. We're at the end time three stages. Baptism. He's speaking of Holy Ghost. Baptism cleanses the heart. So it's not to to do with your vocation, not to do with your thinking. This cleanses the heart. In other words, this is taking care of the snake inside the cause. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you follow his thought? All right. Part of 100. How striking. Now he takes the place where we are to dwell in the earth through the same process. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love him saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Imagine that small little frog or bird can be so annoying. Part of 100. How striking. Now he takes the place where we are to dwell in through the same process. In other words, the the earth. He's called the church through justification, called it through sanctification, fully with the Holy Ghost and fire. Took it through a process that he himself and the Holy Spirit himself, the son of God, could dwell in the heart. Paragraph 102. Now he done the world where that bride is going to live in the same way. Paragraph 103. Next one. Notice the anti-olivian. What's that? Flood. He had it repented by through the bride of that day Noah. He gave it a water baptism. Covered it with water, &gt;&gt; right? Flushed out the earth. We spoke about it on Wednesday. Brought in a new law about spilling of blood. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I will require blood. If you spill blood, I will require. Remember that new law, new earth, adjustment of everything. But it had to be washed with water first. Then paragraph 104 Christ came and shed his blood upon it. He shows how that the blood of Christ drained out of his body and sanctified the earth with his blood. Brother Brandon knocks in the pulpit. See how Satan scripture try to make him break God's plan to receive it. Give it to him when he took up the mountain try to give it to him without the purchase of the blood. Paragraph 110. But now it has to go through a baptism of fire. Do you notice God is not dwelling in it yet? is still cleansing the earth. Baptism of fire, holy fire from God cleanses the earth and the heavens around it. Then it's purchased that redeemed can live on it living in peace. I'm going to go through the highlight for God in the new world that is to come to dwell in the earth. Cuz you said God he dwells in the human heart. He and the bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world. So water in Noah's time, blood in Christ time, fire after the the the battle of Gog and Magog purges the whole earth, then the new heaven and new earth, and the holy city, the new Jerusalem. God comes and dwell. Behold, these are my people. I shall be their God. The tabernacle of God is with man. After three purgings, &gt;&gt; you have to be cleansed. Body, spirit, soul. Three purgings and it takes two baptisms. Water baptism, Holy Ghost and fire. Two baptisms, three purging. &gt;&gt; You have to be immersed in separation and you have to be immersed in ability and zeal. The blood is not asking you to be immersed in it. It's asking for the life to come in. The life of the blood cell is going to come in and purge your mind. Amen. Future home of paragraph. Did we read 111? Let's go to 111. See the heart has to be cleansed like that. I'm closing. Before God can come down in the person of the Holy Ghost, which is Christ come down, dwell in the human heart, it must be repented. It must be baptized in his name. We read this in the beginning to show who it belongs to. Then it must be cleansed by the blood of Jesus. Then the holy fire and holy ghost from God comes down and burns out all desire of sin, all the nature of the world. Do you see that? You'll be water baptized. You'll still make mistakes. You'll you'll be uh uh centered in your mind, directed in your mind by the blood in the life of Christ being preached to you all through the word. Every step is by the word. But then when it comes to Holy Ghost and zeal and fire, that's the part that's going to uproot the evil that caused it in the first place. &gt;&gt; So he speaks of these three purgings, water, blood, spirit, and fire. Saints, once again, the purging of blood comes by revelation of the word. The purging of water comes by revelation of the word. The purging of the Holy Ghost comes by the word. In every stage, it is washing by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's got to be a word in the beginning that draws you to the prophet, to the message. That word will wash you. There's a word that has to do with sanctification while you are in the message that will wash you, that will cleanse you, that will purge you. There's going to be a word under that that gives you ability for the open book that will purge you and will wash you and set you into purpose. &gt;&gt; Praise be to his name. The last purging of the spirit and fire is his face covering um covering out the soul that removes all ability. The phase that is to do with covering uh um uh scouring out the soul that removes all ability to disbelieve the word. Removing every ounce of ability to disbelieve. When you reach that place, you know, um, young people, I'll tell you something. You'll sit around on your phones, you sit around on internet and whatever. You're actually preventing yourself from becoming something. Um, let let me just give you a little bit a little example. Let's say, and I'm not saying you must do this. I'm just saying if you just start here we go back to the car. If you just thought let me start a car wash in my neighborhood. When you washed your first 10 cars and earned that money and that money is yours is taxfree belongs to nobody else not even your parents. You are going to wash a thousand cars. That's my point. Once you've done it once, you're not going to stop. All you have to do is get up out of your couch. &gt;&gt; One time. One time. Earn some money and then you're bugged. You got the bug of earning money. Then you earn enough money and you sell your first car. Then you're going to be a car salesman. You're not washing cars anymore, but it started with washing cars. &gt;&gt; Then you sell your first car. Then you sell a 100 cars. Now you own a dealership. [Music] &gt;&gt; Did you ever think when you started washing cars that you'll be a dealership owner one day? &gt;&gt; That's how it starts. But you that's sitting around on cell phones waiting for an epiphany or some great idea while all the entrepreneurs and millionaires in this world started washing cars selling stuff. &gt;&gt; That's where it started. You know how it started? By giving up idleness. &gt;&gt; That's the trap today. So one of none of these purgings need uh to come with abundance of shouting and screaming. Nothing not one of them needs to come with that. Right? You can it might happen to you. There's no common recipe for everyone. But what is certain is you need to be purged in every way body spirit and soul. If you apply the thought going through these two baptisms and three purgings, it is the restoration of all things unto God. It makes you the person, you your person, the future home &gt;&gt; of the heavenly bridegroom, the word and the person. &gt;&gt; That's the whole point of it. It's going to make you the future home &gt;&gt; of the marriage of the lamb and his bride. I'm saying that in your baptisms, you will be purged by the washing of water by the word. You'll be justified by the waters of your water baptism, separation, sanctified by the life cell in the blood of Christ, uh sealed by the Holy Spirit of God's ability and zeal to save the souls of others. The true baptism of the Holy Ghost will give you a heart for people and make you desire to speak the word and share your love of God. You don't even have to teach the seals to someone. &gt;&gt; Share your love of God with someone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lift up someone's spirit from where they are downfallen and and crestf fallen. Just lift them up with your love of him. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they'll come to you. You know what's a problem I find with message churches today? This is a disgrace. And I'm going to say it. You don't even have enough oil for the foolish virgin to come and ask you. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Maybe you got oil. I don't know what it's in your basement or something. But the foolish virgin is not even coming to ask you. In fact, you're looking at them and thinking they got more oil. And that's why you're trying to resurrect what they had. You're not even living in that vision. The true baptism of the Holy Ghost will give you a heart for people. You will not be afraid to be scorned or rejected. You will not be afraid to tell the truth because you are set free. You will not care to work things out because you know he will put the word in your mouth in due season when it is necessary. It will make you see all people as equals and treat them as Christ's sheep and give you the heart to strengthen your brethren. I got nothing more to say. I'm going to read two quotes and we done. Paragraph 79. What if baptism inducts you into fellowship? The Holy Spirit baptism inducts you into Christ. &gt;&gt; There is the truth. Marriage of the lamb. This is just to inspire you. inspire you and tell you, I hope you've had enough of yourself and let's become better people. A lot of us get ourselves puffed up when uh when we get a Pentecostal brother uh see somebody down in a little u mission or a little bitty church and they go to a big church, we belong to the first church or the big church or something like that and look down upon them. What you need is the Holy Ghost to deflate you a little bit. Let you know that a real true baptism of the Holy Ghost will make a tuxedo suit, put his arms around a pair of overalls and say, "Brother, &gt;&gt; that's real oldtime salvation. The powerful almighty God, yes sir, will make an old silk dress, put its arms around a calico and say, "Sister, I love you." It sure will. There's what's lacking. sniping at each other from the shadows like a long gun shooter. No guts to come up to a brother and tell him, "I disagree with you. Let's talk this out. Let's fellowship. Let's see where we disagree. Let's love one another still." Where is that? Where is that? That I can reach out to someone who is who is less than me, who is different to me, and say, "I love you. We're one. I'm not above you. I'm not elite. I tell you, not enough oil for a foolish virgin to come knocking at your door. This is what's happening today. Saints, young people, I know it's a lot, but trust me, it's not even a scratch. There's so much in there. Go and read the messages I've recommended to you. Take those scriptures when when you read the Bible, read a scripture and dream about it. Sit back in a chair. Put your phone off. Sit back in a chair and think, "Lord, what was it like in John the Baptist day and let dream I'm standing on the banks of the river Jordan and he's baptizing people. Describe what he looks like. Describe what the water's like. Describe the faces of the people. Describe the Pharisees. Think about what he was preaching before he got in the water. Describe where he lived. Describe the house where he came from. Describe those who were baptized. Go think about what they had to do to come to that water. Think about how they had to walk down that bank with the scribes and Pharisees and Sadducees standing there looking at them, knowing that they're waiting for them to come out of the water to to get at them, to persecute them. And then you'll find something come upon you to realize what you have to go through. Now it's not just one verse. Now it's volumes. Do that for all the scriptures in the Bible. If ever you had something to dream, you know, I got down on my pillow last night. I I got to bed like about 1:30 or something and I just could still couldn't sleep. I was just my mind was still in this and I'm still dreaming about it and then eventually it put me to sleep because it was so peaceful and amazing. Put me to sleep cuz I I it could get everything else out of my head. But um I I was so enjoying thinking about what God has done for us through all the generations. It's so peaceful. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads together.
