[0:01] Praise the Lord. Good evening, bride.
[0:04] Uh, I communicated with brothers Stephen
[0:09] and uh, I thought uh, we had an
[0:11] understanding that uh, he will be
[0:14] introducing his son tonight,
[0:17] but uh, I don't know, maybe there
[0:19] there's a problem with the connection.
[0:21] Uh, so I guess uh, I may have to
[0:25] introduce our dear brother tonight. Uh I
[0:29] don't know much about our brother except
[0:31] that I know that he's he's a son of a
[0:34] very good minister
[0:36] &gt;&gt; of the message
[0:38] and uh maybe he can uh we we'll just let
[0:42] him tell about his ministry tell about
[0:45] himself a little amen before going into
[0:47] the word. So without further delay uh we
[0:50] want to welcome our dear brother
[0:53] Alistister
[0:55] Francis. God bless you.
[0:59] [Applause]
[1:02] Amen. God bless you saints. Uh it's good
[1:05] to be speaking to the bride of Christ
[1:08] around the world and especially the
[1:09] Philippines. I um really don't need much
[1:14] uh introduction because I believe the
[1:17] word is far more important than myself.
[1:20] But I just I suppose I could take a few
[1:22] minutes just to tell you. I'm a pastor
[1:24] in uh Durban, South Africa
[1:27] and I've been a pastor for almost 20
[1:30] years. In fact, it's going to be the
[1:31] 20th year next year. And um so it's just
[1:35] a great privilege for me to have to do
[1:38] this. This is the first time. I can't
[1:40] believe something like this has actually
[1:41] happened where we are doing uh
[1:44] conventions like this. So uh but I'm
[1:47] thankful that the Lord has given us this
[1:49] uh opportunity. I um I obviously am
[1:54] married. Uh my wife's name is Lina and
[1:58] we have three sons. Uh Declan, Jordan,
[2:02] and Josh. And um we have a wonderful
[2:06] group of um people here in the message
[2:08] here in Durban who love the Lord with
[2:10] all their heart and who love the
[2:12] ministry of the open book and the
[2:14] revealed word of the hour. And as I
[2:16] believe that you also do the same. So we
[2:19] bring greetings from all of them. Uh
[2:22] before I begin, I would just like to
[2:25] thank all the ministers and also all the
[2:27] brothers who put the meetings together.
[2:30] Also all the saints around the world who
[2:32] are watching right now or listening in.
[2:35] Uh we thank you for this opportunity.
[2:38] It's a great honor for me to be doing
[2:39] this and I trust that the word would be
[2:42] a blessing to you this evening. Also,
[2:44] it's a great honor for me to be
[2:46] preaching with brother Steve. It's been
[2:49] a um a desire for us to do this together
[2:52] and we've never done it before. To be
[2:54] preaching in the same convention in in
[2:57] 20 years. So for me to be preaching with
[3:00] him is also a great honor. So I just
[3:02] want to give thanks to all the men of
[3:04] God uh who have been able to put these
[3:07] meetings together. So without much ado,
[3:10] I want to get into the word. Uh so and
[3:13] also greet all of you. I think it's good
[3:15] morning to some of you, good day to some
[3:17] of you and good evening to some of you.
[3:19] So the Lord bless you this evening. And
[3:22] um so I want to begin by saying you know
[3:24] the theme walking in the vision can be a
[3:27] really difficult one for a preacher to
[3:30] navigate. We have questions about uh
[3:34] what vision when when the theme was
[3:37] given to us walking in the vision. Some
[3:39] of the questions that come to you are
[3:41] what vision? How do the people interpret
[3:44] this? Is it a specific uh vision that
[3:48] the people are talking about? Is it the
[3:51] visions of the seventh seal or the third
[3:53] pole? Maybe. Is there an overall vision
[3:56] that everyone assumes that there might
[3:59] exist? Um, is it perhaps God's vision
[4:02] that we assume he has for us or a vision
[4:06] we all assume everyone in the message
[4:08] knows about and are struggling
[4:10] desperately to keep up with? So, u maybe
[4:14] we assume the vision means a secret
[4:16] mysterious blueprint that needs severe
[4:19] decoding so that we can understand it
[4:21] and be saved by it. So, we have to clear
[4:24] that up. And I want to say this as an
[4:27] introduction. Vision means sight. If
[4:32] even if someone says they had a vision,
[4:35] it means they saw something or something
[4:37] was revealed to their inner eye giving
[4:40] them knowledge or something to happen or
[4:43] revelation of something that was
[4:45] previously misunderstood.
[4:47] So vision means sight and sight brings
[4:51] wisdom and revelation. For example, if
[4:54] all the lights were off in your room,
[4:56] you can't really walk through the room
[5:00] or all the lights were off in your house
[5:02] and you you can't navigate yourself
[5:04] through the house. You would bump into
[5:06] things. If you put a little bit of dim
[5:08] light in there, you could move a little
[5:10] uh slower and you could find your way
[5:11] around. If you had a bright torch in
[5:14] your hand, you could locate things and
[5:16] run around the room perhaps, but you
[5:18] might stumble over things. But if you
[5:20] put um a full light in the room, you
[5:23] could jump around, dance around, scream,
[5:26] shout, run at a high speed because light
[5:28] has illuminated everything. So sight
[5:32] brings wisdom and revelation. If someone
[5:36] has sight, then it means they have
[5:39] direction and purpose. So walking in the
[5:42] vision simply means living by true
[5:44] direction and purpose from the wisdom
[5:47] and revelation given to you. Amen. Now
[5:51] having said that most believers have
[5:53] settled into a circle walk. they're
[5:57] walking in the message uh in a message
[5:59] circle around the name William Brham
[6:02] going to church observing Christian
[6:04] religion or uh or or spreading a
[6:08] Christian religion of spreading the
[6:10] message getting converts baptizing
[6:13] people adding numbers to a church.
[6:16] Everyone can baptize many people but how
[6:19] many have you brought to the perfection
[6:21] of the faith?
[6:23] So young people think the vision is to
[6:26] live blameless for as long as possible,
[6:28] marry someone in the message, have
[6:30] children, and stay in the message as
[6:33] long as you live. Older people have done
[6:35] that and have reached the stage where
[6:37] they ask themselves, "What now? Isn't
[6:41] there more to this?"
[6:43] So the real problem is that people lose
[6:45] track of what their purpose is because
[6:48] they forget what it is that was lost and
[6:52] that must be restored. They argue about
[6:54] the seals and the thunders for the same
[6:56] reason. So everyone who assumes he
[6:59] understands the theory of the message
[7:01] assumes he must have the answer to the
[7:03] questions on the seals and the thunders
[7:05] and he must spread it to the message
[7:07] world thinking that he will solve all
[7:09] their problems. In the meantime, we
[7:12] distract ourselves with church, learning
[7:14] to sing song items, giving testimonies
[7:16] of healings and miracles, doing
[7:19] thanksgivings and weddings and funerals.
[7:21] And that seems to have been the kind of
[7:23] culture we've lived through for the last
[7:25] 40 or 50 years in the message. There is
[7:28] no purpose and no vision in these
[7:31] things. There is no purpose and no
[7:32] vision in going to church, learning to
[7:35] sing song items, testimonies, healings,
[7:37] miracles, thanksgivings, weddings,
[7:39] funerals, and on and on. The cycle goes
[7:41] every year. There is no purpose and no
[7:44] vision in these things. These are things
[7:47] that all other humans do, believers and
[7:49] unbelievers. Are we saved because we do
[7:52] all these things better than them? Or do
[7:55] we really do it or do we really do it
[7:58] better than them? They seem to be far
[8:00] more successful at what they do though.
[8:03] Now, I don't pretend to have all the
[8:05] answers, but I cannot even give you some
[8:08] of the answers to these questions in
[8:10] just two services. So, I will use this
[8:13] time to take you back into the vision.
[8:16] The wisdom and revelation is going to
[8:17] depend upon you and how you allow
[8:20] yourself to be led of the Lord. Amen. So
[8:24] with that, I would like to open up our
[8:27] Bibles and read in Genesis 1 26-27
[8:31] and also Genesis chapter 2:7. I suppose
[8:34] the brothers would be able to put up the
[8:37] uh scriptures for you on the screen and
[8:39] you can follow closely or you can follow
[8:42] in your Bible. So reading from Genesis
[8:45] chapter 1 verse 26- 27.
[8:50] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[8:53] image, and after our likeness, and let
[8:57] them have dominion over the fish of the
[8:59] sea, and over the fowl of the air." Now,
[9:01] notice those words. Let us make man in
[9:05] our image, and after our likeness. Let
[9:08] them have dominion over the fish of the
[9:10] sea, and over the fowl of the air, and
[9:12] over the cattle, and over all the earth,
[9:15] and over every creeping thing that
[9:16] creepeth upon the earth. So God created
[9:20] man in his own image. In the image of
[9:22] God created he him. In the image of God
[9:26] created he him. Remember that verse 27.
[9:30] God created man in his own image. In the
[9:34] image of God created he him. Male and
[9:37] female created he them. Amen. The Lord
[9:41] add a blessing to his word. We'll read
[9:43] Genesis 2:7 a little later.
[9:46] So I would like us to consider these two
[9:48] phrases in beginning uh with this
[9:51] message. I want to take the theme that
[9:54] we're speaking of walking in the vision
[9:57] and I want to take for a subject the
[9:59] image and the likeness of God and for a
[10:03] title today we're going to speak about
[10:05] dominion. Amen. So our subject the image
[10:08] and the likeness of God and we're going
[10:11] to speak about dominion.
[10:13] Now consider the two phrases that you
[10:16] see there in our image and after our
[10:21] likeness. Now you're going to see these
[10:23] phrases look so simple that it passes
[10:26] over the head of the casual reader and
[10:28] yet the Holy Spirit can reveal so much
[10:30] in it. In fact, if you study the Greek
[10:32] and the Hebrew, you may be totally
[10:34] confused because the languages do not
[10:36] even reveal that much of it. But we
[10:38] trust the Lord that he allowed the Bible
[10:41] to be written in a certain way that we
[10:43] might see the mysteries. Now notice, man
[10:46] was first made in the image and after
[10:49] the likeness of God. Right? That's what
[10:52] God's desire was to make man in his
[10:55] image and after his likeness. So first
[10:58] let's understand what image and likeness
[11:01] means. Most people in the world think
[11:04] that image and likeness mean the same
[11:06] thing. But it's not the same thing. The
[11:08] Bible is so accurate about these things.
[11:10] Remember this Bible was translated into
[11:13] English from uh the Chalian language,
[11:15] from the Hebrew language, from the
[11:17] Aramaic language, from the Greek and so
[11:19] on. So when you have repetitions like in
[11:22] the image and after the likeness of God
[11:25] is because the English translators were
[11:27] trying to uh translate it from the
[11:30] different words and meanings that were
[11:32] written there in the early text. So
[11:34] let's understand what image and likeness
[11:37] means. The word image in the context of
[11:40] scripture does not mean picture or
[11:44] shape. It does not mean uh what
[11:46] something looks like. The image of
[11:49] something means the absolute expression
[11:52] of the thing. Right?
[11:55] So this shows us that when man was first
[11:58] made in the image of God, he was the
[12:01] absolute expression of the nature of
[12:03] God. This means he was made in the very
[12:06] material that God was, which at that
[12:09] time was the logos, the word which we
[12:12] know is theophony. So that was the
[12:16] image. The image of God is the word. It
[12:19] is theophony. It is spirit man. It is
[12:22] man of that dimension at seventh
[12:25] dimension which is invisible to this
[12:27] one. That is the image. And it's all
[12:30] about absolute expression. It's about
[12:32] expression of the nature, expression of
[12:35] the character of God. Now how do we know
[12:37] this? The entire Bible has a good
[12:39] continuity of this. If you read Hebrews
[12:42] chapter 10 and verse one, you see the
[12:45] scripture says, "For the law having a
[12:47] shadow of good things to come, and not
[12:50] the very image of the things, can never
[12:54] with those sacrifices which they offered
[12:57] year by year continually make the comers
[13:00] there unto perfect." So notice that
[13:02] phrase, not the very image of things.
[13:05] That scripture is telling us that uh of
[13:07] what image refers to, right? You could
[13:09] see what the image of things refers to
[13:12] in Hebrews 10:1. Paul was saying that
[13:14] the law was not expressing the full
[13:16] truth of things. It was just a type or a
[13:20] shadow or a likeness.
[13:23] So you can see the difference between
[13:24] image and likeness. Right? So image
[13:28] refers to the full truth of something,
[13:32] the character, the nature of something.
[13:35] Excuse me. So with correct English, when
[13:38] you say a boy is the very image of his
[13:42] father, you're saying he is like his
[13:44] father in every way, in every detail.
[13:47] But you are actually incorrect because
[13:49] this is never the case in humans. No son
[13:52] is exactly identical in nature to his
[13:56] father. What you are referring to is his
[13:58] likeness. You're referring to what he
[14:00] looks like. So this differs when you say
[14:03] he is the likeness of his father. That
[14:05] would be more correct. So if man was
[14:08] made in the image of God, he was made in
[14:11] the very material that can express the
[14:14] very nature of God. See, he was made in
[14:16] the word form first. Uh and in that word
[14:20] form, he could express the very nature
[14:22] of God. He was expressing the divine
[14:24] nature of God. Clearly this material
[14:27] that man was first made in was not the
[14:30] flesh. It was theophony. Genesis
[14:32] 1:26-27.
[14:34] It was theophony man. Right? So the word
[14:37] is the image of God. We can conclude
[14:39] that the image of God is the material of
[14:43] the word. Now when we think about the
[14:45] word today, you know, most people when
[14:47] when you talk about the word, they think
[14:48] of the Bible, they think of scriptures,
[14:50] they think of the message, they think of
[14:52] written word and so on. But to us, uh
[14:55] that's as much as we can see. That's as
[14:57] much as we can feel. But in terms of the
[15:00] scripture, in terms of the revelation
[15:03] word, the word is a person is a physical
[15:06] person. The word is a is a is an um is
[15:09] theophony. Theophony is a material of a
[15:13] of a different dimension. Right? And
[15:15] that's the image that man was first made
[15:17] in. Now, if you look in cood volume 1
[15:22] and uh page 13, paragraph 17, we're not
[15:25] going to read that. Uh or rather we can
[15:27] Yes, we can. And I think if the brothers
[15:28] have it, they can put it up on the
[15:30] screen. This is question and answers on
[15:32] Genesis preached in Jeffersonville 53
[15:35] 29th of July. And this is page 13
[15:38] paragraph 17.
[15:40] And the prophet is saying when God made
[15:42] his first man, if you notice, he made
[15:46] him in the likeness of himself, right?
[15:49] In the likeness of himself. He was made
[15:51] in the image of God. And what is God?
[15:55] Now further or rather before that he was
[15:58] saying that God is his spirit and if you
[16:00] know what God was then you will know
[16:02] what kind of man. So here's what he
[16:03] says. Now if we can find out what God is
[16:07] we can find out what kind of man he
[16:10] made. So obviously the man of Genesis
[16:13] 2:7 who was made in flesh was not in the
[16:17] image of God. It was the man of Genesis
[16:19] 1:26-27
[16:21] that was the image of God. Right? So
[16:24] then if we know that the image of God
[16:27] was uh theophony, it was the word,
[16:30] right? What is the likeness? Because
[16:33] he's not just repeating things. Let us
[16:36] let us make man in the image and after
[16:38] our likeness. He's not saying the same
[16:41] thing. He's not repeating the same
[16:43] meaning. God does not do that. So image
[16:46] means something. Likeness means
[16:48] something else. So image speaks of the
[16:51] character, the nature, the absolute
[16:53] expression. So what does likeness mean?
[16:57] Likeness means absolute resemblance. So
[17:01] resemblance is what is visible.
[17:04] Resemblance is what God looks like. The
[17:07] likeness of God is what God looks like.
[17:10] So what does God look like? So, see, a
[17:13] likeness is a close resemblance of what
[17:16] something looks like or appears to be,
[17:18] but not necessarily what it is. If you
[17:20] want to know what something really is,
[17:22] you've got to know the nature of it, the
[17:24] image of it. But the likeness of it is
[17:27] what it looks like. It's what it appears
[17:30] to be. So for example, if you read
[17:32] Romans chapter 6 and verse 5, it says,
[17:35] "For if we have been planted together in
[17:38] the likeness of his death, we shall also
[17:41] be in the likeness of his resurrection."
[17:44] So that scripture is telling us that you
[17:46] don't have to literally die the same
[17:48] way. You have to have the likeness of
[17:51] his death, the appearance of his death
[17:53] or um something that resembles his
[17:57] death. And if you have that then you
[17:59] will also have something that resembles
[18:01] his resurrection. See, so this is not
[18:04] saying you are planted in the image of
[18:05] his death and you will have the image of
[18:07] his resurrection. That would be the
[18:09] exact nature of it. But likeness is what
[18:12] it appears to be. So in other words,
[18:14] today you have to have self-sacrifice.
[18:17] Dying to oneself is not the same as what
[18:20] Christ did at Calvary, but it is the
[18:22] likeness of that. And so if you have the
[18:25] likeness of that death, you can have the
[18:27] likeness of the resurrection. I hope you
[18:29] are seeing the reason we are reading the
[18:31] scripture is to show you the difference
[18:33] between the words image and likeness. It
[18:36] make us understand the scriptures a lot
[18:38] better. So we are then resurrected a new
[18:41] creature in the word not having died a
[18:45] physical death but a spiritual death to
[18:48] our old natures. And therefore we can
[18:51] have a resurrection. See that is the
[18:54] likeness of Christ's death and
[18:56] resurrection. All right. So, but the big
[18:59] secret is that God also has a likeness
[19:03] that man has constantly been searching
[19:05] for and God forbid man to find it. You
[19:08] see, no matter how God reveals his image
[19:11] to us, man is more interested in his
[19:13] likeness. Man always wants to know what
[19:15] God looks like. Uh is he in some form?
[19:18] Man always draws pictures, makes idols.
[19:21] um uh makes images or rather uh um
[19:25] pictures in his head or forms fantasies
[19:28] about him and God does not want that.
[19:30] God rather wants you to know him in his
[19:34] image. But man is only seeking after the
[19:37] likeness. So what is the likeness of
[19:40] God? What does he look like? What does
[19:42] he resemble when he exists as God? What
[19:46] is he manifested as? Now if you read
[19:48] Isaiah 40 and verse 18 with me, you can
[19:51] see it says to whom then will you liken
[19:55] God? Or what likeness will you compare
[19:59] unto him? So this shows us that the
[20:02] question has been there for a very long
[20:04] time. I mean since the time of Isaiah,
[20:06] what is the likeness of God? So it's a
[20:09] long study that I've done with our
[20:10] church and which I don't have time to do
[20:12] now. But we find out that the scripture
[20:15] and the message reveals if you read the
[20:17] entire message of the prophet. Brother
[20:19] Marram speaks primarily throughout his
[20:22] message about the relationship of Christ
[20:25] and the church of Christ and the bride
[20:27] about the masculine attribute and the
[20:29] feminine attribute in in after the seals
[20:32] were open or revealed rather to us uh by
[20:36] the ministry of the third Paul. we find
[20:38] that he went so much more into the
[20:41] relationship of uh the masculine and the
[20:44] feminine attributes. The relationship
[20:45] between Christ and the bride. You
[20:47] remember the message Christ the mystery
[20:48] of God revealed. He spoke about all that
[20:50] was in God was poured into Christ and
[20:52] then all that was in Christ poured into
[20:54] the church. And the third fold of the
[20:55] mystery is Christ and the bride going
[20:57] back to Eden. So you remember that. But
[21:00] we find that the scripture and the
[21:02] message reveals the likeness of God as
[21:06] being now take this carefully two
[21:10] attributes in perfect harmony. Right? So
[21:14] if you just try to imagine this uh using
[21:18] our carnal imagination right now which I
[21:20] don't like to do regularly but I'm
[21:22] asking you to do that now. When God
[21:24] created man, as we read in Genesis 1:26,
[21:28] he said, "Let us make man in our image
[21:30] and after our likeness." And then what
[21:32] did he make? He made them male and
[21:35] female, two attributes in one body, two
[21:38] attributes in perfect harmony. Now that
[21:41] was their likeness. What was their
[21:43] image? Their image was theophony. But
[21:45] what do they resemble? What did they
[21:48] appear as? They appeared as two
[21:50] attributes in perfect harmony with one
[21:53] attribute leading and one attribute in
[21:55] submission. That's the likeness of God.
[21:58] Now, just to show you that this likeness
[22:02] is so powerful, it's creative. It's
[22:06] creative force in in the entire world.
[22:10] Everything that operates in the world
[22:12] operates with two natures in perfect
[22:14] harmony. If you look at uh reproduction,
[22:18] it's going to take the masculine and
[22:20] feminine natures to find perfect harmony
[22:22] to produce more children. If you look at
[22:25] electricity, it's got to take uh for the
[22:28] lay man, negative charges and positive
[22:30] charges to be in perfect harmony to
[22:32] produce electricity. Um to have water
[22:35] flow, there's got to be high pressure
[22:37] and low pressure in perfect harmony for
[22:39] water to flow in a certain direction.
[22:41] For magnetism, you'd have to have the
[22:44] north pole and the south pole in perfect
[22:46] harmony for there to be magnetism. These
[22:49] these are constantly throughout nature,
[22:51] two attributes in perfect harmony that
[22:54] can bring creation that can bring a
[22:57] powerful domination of something to to
[23:00] bring things together and and create
[23:02] massive things throughout the earth. uh
[23:04] even bringing forth life that is going
[23:08] back that is the resemblance of God
[23:11] excuse me that is the likeness of God.
[23:15] Now all these things like electricity
[23:18] magnetism
[23:19] u a flow of water high pressure low
[23:22] pressure these are like the the um
[23:25] shadows of shadows or shadows or shadows
[23:27] of what the real thing really is. When
[23:30] you take it all the way back, all the
[23:32] way back to God, you come back to the
[23:34] two attributes in perfect harmony which
[23:37] was in the logos, the attribute of
[23:39] Christ, the male, and the attribute of
[23:42] the bride, the female of the word. Amen.
[23:46] I hope you're understanding this and I
[23:48] hope you can see these things and I hope
[23:50] you've been taught these things so we
[23:51] can get through this quicker. So two
[23:53] attributes in perfect harmony existing
[23:56] as one with one in subjection to the
[24:00] other. That's the likeness of God. It's
[24:03] not the image. The image is the
[24:05] offering. The image is the character of
[24:07] the word. This uh resemblance of God. In
[24:11] other words, what God looks like when he
[24:14] is manifesting himself is two attributes
[24:16] in perfect harmony existing as one with
[24:19] one in perfect submission to the other.
[24:22] So notice the desire of God in Genesis
[24:24] 1:26. Let us make man. I want to be
[24:27] specific about the words. Let us make
[24:29] man in our image and after our likeness.
[24:35] Notice after our likeness. Now you'll
[24:38] find places where he you'll speak about
[24:41] man made in the image and in the
[24:43] likeness. But God's desire, his ultimate
[24:46] desire was for man to live in the image
[24:49] of God but after his likeness. Which
[24:52] means the the the likeness of man would
[24:55] be a resemblance of what God really is.
[24:59] And we'll explain that. Now careful
[25:01] study will show us that this was
[25:03] actually two different existences of man
[25:06] when this word was completely fulfilled.
[25:08] That means in Genesis 1:26-27,
[25:12] he was made in the image and in the
[25:14] likeness after our likeness was only
[25:17] manifested once the woman was made in
[25:20] Genesis 2. So let's follow this in
[25:22] Genesis 1:26-27.
[25:24] Man is made in the image and in the
[25:26] likeness in theophony. Brother man
[25:28] called that created man. You'll find
[25:31] that in Cood. He says when Genesis 2,
[25:34] man was made, he was formed man. He said
[25:37] there's a difference between created man
[25:39] and formed man. Now let's go to Genesis
[25:42] 5 and verse one. The Bible says this is
[25:46] the book of the generations of Adam. In
[25:48] the day that God created man in the
[25:51] likeness of God made he him. That means
[25:55] the first man was made in Genesis
[25:57] 1:26-27 was the perfect resemblance of
[26:02] God. He was made in the likeness. Right?
[26:05] But notice God's desire was that they
[26:07] should be after his likeness. And we'll
[26:09] explain that now. In the day that he was
[26:12] created, created man, theophony, that
[26:16] was made in the image and in the
[26:17] likeness. Which means in theophony, male
[26:20] and female were perfectly in harmony.
[26:24] Female in perfect submission to the man.
[26:27] They existed in one body. Right? And
[26:31] that was what God looks like. That's the
[26:33] resemblance of God. Amen. That's the
[26:36] perfect expression of God's resemblance.
[26:39] Now, we even notice that the prophet's
[26:40] saying the same thing in this question
[26:42] one in in COD volume 1, page 13,
[26:45] paragraph 17. Now, this man was made
[26:48] theophony. We won't read that now. But
[26:51] this man was made the he was in the
[26:54] image. Two attributes in perfect harmony
[26:57] in word form. That was in the likeness.
[27:00] Now, if you go to Genesis 2:7, now what
[27:02] is Genesis 2:7? It is God forming Adam
[27:06] from the dust of the ground. Right? It's
[27:09] there. He is in the image of beast
[27:12] because that body of flesh was the image
[27:14] of beast and and he was after the
[27:16] likeness of God. Why was he after the
[27:19] likeness of God? So that's what we need
[27:20] to find out. That was formed man. If you
[27:23] don't believe me, let's read the word
[27:24] question and answers on Genesis uh page
[27:27] 21 paragraph 65.
[27:30] The prophet saying, "And then he put man
[27:33] in the dust of the earth which was the
[27:36] first man Adam and that man was made
[27:40] after the image or this human man here
[27:43] is made after the image of an animal."
[27:46] See, so what what brother Mary's saying
[27:48] is that the the body of mankind is made
[27:53] in the material. It's got the character
[27:56] of animal. It needs to eat. It needs to
[27:59] sleep. It needs to do things that
[28:01] animals do. It needs to breathe the air
[28:03] of this world. It needs to interact with
[28:06] other creatures. Uh there's a it has
[28:09] those kind of characteristic and
[28:11] capabilities. This is not the same image
[28:14] as theophony. Right? So these human
[28:18] bodies I'm reading says are are made in
[28:22] the image of animal. So clearly this man
[28:25] of Genesis 2:7 was not in the image of
[28:29] God but animal or beast. Amen. So but he
[28:34] was after the likeness of God. Why?
[28:38] Because when he was theophony he was
[28:40] made up of the masculine attribute of
[28:42] the logos and the feminine attribute of
[28:45] the logos which is the word that is
[28:47] Christ and the bride in logos form. But
[28:50] here in Genesis 2, man, he was after the
[28:54] likeness of God. Because within that man
[28:57] who was standing there in flesh, there
[28:59] were two natures still in perfect
[29:00] harmony inside him. But these two
[29:03] natures, watch this. These two natures
[29:05] inside this flesh body are the natures
[29:08] of masculine and feminist man. They are
[29:12] the masculine natures of man and the
[29:14] feminist natures of man. That is the
[29:16] flesh of the man. And because the the
[29:18] the feminist nature was still inside the
[29:21] man, they were in perfect harmony. They
[29:23] there was after the likeness of God. It
[29:26] was another kind of resemblance of God.
[29:29] As long as Adam had that feminist nature
[29:31] inside of him, he was all powerful. He
[29:34] had dominion. He was the God of the
[29:36] earth. He could move things. He could
[29:39] name things. He could place things in
[29:40] the ecological order. He could he could
[29:44] rule the entire earth. because he had
[29:48] this power of creation because he had
[29:50] the perfect resemblance of God. So when
[29:53] you look at Adam, however, he looked
[29:56] male even though he had the feminine
[29:58] attribute inside him, he looked male
[30:01] because the female was the secret. She
[30:03] was hidden because of subjection. This
[30:06] condition was the completion of God's
[30:09] desire that God expressed in Genesis
[30:11] 1:26-27.
[30:13] Now notice what happens after the curse.
[30:17] When man has his first children,
[30:20] something happens. Now this is after the
[30:22] curse, right? That is after Eve had
[30:25] sinned. Uh Adam had sinned and they had
[30:27] been uh sent out of the garden of Eden.
[30:30] Now we come to Genesis 5 2:3 and see
[30:33] what happens.
[30:35] uh reading male and female created he
[30:37] them and blessed them and called their
[30:41] name Adam in the day when they were
[30:44] created and Adam lived in 130 years and
[30:47] begat a son in his own likeness after
[30:51] his image and called his name Seth. Now
[30:53] notice that when Adam has a son his son
[30:57] is in his likeness but after his image.
[31:01] Can you see that? That means just to
[31:03] magnify our point here, when we bring
[31:05] forth children because of sexuality,
[31:08] they are nowhere near as accurate as the
[31:11] creation of God. Our sons who are born
[31:15] are born in our likeness. That means
[31:17] they resemble us. They look like us.
[31:19] They may bear a close resemblance of us.
[31:22] People will say, "Wow, he looks just
[31:23] like his father." But they never really
[31:27] look like us identical, right?
[31:30] identically. They don't they're not
[31:32] identical to us. So therefore, they are
[31:34] in our likeness. They resemble us and
[31:38] they are after our image. They're not in
[31:41] our image. Why? Because our sons are
[31:43] never always like us 100% in character
[31:48] and in nature. In fact, more than often
[31:51] as we have more children, we find that
[31:54] our sons develop their own natures by
[31:57] influences, by their own will. They just
[31:59] go on developing their own natures. So
[32:02] um they are after our image. They are
[32:05] not in our image. Now this is not me
[32:07] speaking. This is the Bible saying that
[32:08] when Adam had his sons, they were in his
[32:11] likeness and after his image. So they
[32:13] will they will never absolutely manifest
[32:17] only what we are. Our sons will never
[32:20] manifest only what we are or fully
[32:22] express our character. which shows that
[32:25] getting away from the original way
[32:28] brings about a change of character.
[32:30] Amen. I hope you are with me. So image
[32:34] is about character and nature and
[32:37] likeness is about resemblance. Right?
[32:40] Image is about character and nature and
[32:43] likeness is about resemblance or what it
[32:46] appears to be or what it looks like or
[32:49] what is visible. image and car image or
[32:52] character in nature is invisible.
[32:55] Likeness is what is visible. Amen. So
[32:59] let's have a look and and speak about
[33:02] this uh u dominion or or how this
[33:06] applies to dominion. That's what I want
[33:08] to really get into uh today. So we know
[33:12] that God's existing form was spirit,
[33:17] right? You remember in John 4:24 when he
[33:19] was speaking to the woman at the well uh
[33:22] he said to her God is a spirit and you
[33:25] must worship him in spirit and in truth.
[33:28] Amen. So God is a spirit. God's existing
[33:31] form was spirit. Now those of us who
[33:34] know the message know that uh the how
[33:36] the prophet teaches us and he speaks
[33:37] about this in the question and answers
[33:39] in uh Genesis 1 volume 1 of the cood. He
[33:42] says before there was space and time,
[33:46] God existed by himself. Uh God existed
[33:51] uh he was not even God. Uh there was
[33:54] nothing to worship him. He was this
[33:57] spirit that filled all whatever there
[34:00] was there. I don't even think we could
[34:01] call it space and time because time
[34:02] wasn't even even created there. So he
[34:06] just existed. That is I am
[34:09] right. He he existed. And then the
[34:11] prophet said from out of him was this
[34:13] logos. The logos came into
[34:15] manifestation. And that was John 1:1. In
[34:18] the beginning was the word. The word was
[34:21] with God and the word was God. So that
[34:22] is the God giving birth to himself. In
[34:26] other words, unfolding his natures into
[34:29] a visible form of a different existence.
[34:33] So what was the word? What was logos? It
[34:36] was God becoming or choosing to become
[34:39] visible that when he brings something
[34:41] into creation, he could be visible to
[34:44] that creation. So theophony or the
[34:46] seventh dimension was visible to the
[34:49] angels that create that he created and
[34:52] those angels worshiped him and that was
[34:55] when he became God. If you remember the
[34:57] words of the prophet was that when God
[35:00] when when he created angels he became
[35:02] God because there was something to
[35:04] worship him. But when he created man was
[35:07] when he became a father because man was
[35:10] his son. Amen. That's a quote. So
[35:13] according to Genesis 1:26,
[35:16] God's desire was to create man in our
[35:20] im. He said in our image and after our
[35:22] likeness. Now people the reason why
[35:25] we're talking about this
[35:28] is because like I said in the beginning
[35:30] when we speak about walking in the
[35:32] vision and uh people in this world
[35:36] people in the message seem to be just
[35:39] living a message tradition totally
[35:42] unaware of what our purpose is of what
[35:46] our direction is or why you read the
[35:48] word why you listen to the word why you
[35:51] even need the word. Um, needing the the
[35:55] word is not about making it to heaven.
[35:58] No, we're not interested in making it to
[36:00] heaven. The bride of Christ, we know we
[36:02] are citizens of heaven. We don't need to
[36:05] make it there. We are from there.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; We have a purpose to fulfill here on
[36:11] earth.
[36:12] &gt;&gt; We're not afraid of hell. There's hell
[36:14] is not an option for us. We were
[36:16] predestinated before the foundation of
[36:18] the world. We were in his mind.
[36:20] uh being the bride of Christ is
[36:22] different to being the church of the
[36:23] church ages. That is not even our
[36:26] discussion. We are not living the
[36:28] standards of the message or keeping the
[36:30] message so that we can keep it so well
[36:32] that we will make it in the rapture only
[36:34] if we are able to keep the laws. If you
[36:37] have that understanding, you have not
[36:39] seen the opening of the word yet.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; So we are of heaven which means we are
[36:45] not trying to make it to heaven. We know
[36:47] that one day heaven will embrace us.
[36:50] &gt;&gt; But then our vision has got to do with
[36:53] something here on earth.
[36:55] &gt;&gt; The vision that must produce wisdom and
[36:57] revelation has got something to do with
[36:59] here on earth. Something that must be
[37:01] manifested here on earth. And we know
[37:04] that if we can see what it is that was
[37:08] lost, then we we have the vision of what
[37:11] must be restored in this time. Now
[37:15] according to Genesis 1:26, like we were
[37:17] saying, God's desire was to create man
[37:19] in our image and after our likeness. Now
[37:23] we know that brother Brandham says that
[37:26] the father was communing with the word.
[37:29] He was communing with the logos. Right?
[37:30] Now this is important and we're going to
[37:32] see this a very beautiful thing that
[37:34] takes place here. When you say in the
[37:37] beginning was the word, the word was
[37:38] with God and the word was God. That
[37:41] sounds like two people. No matter how
[37:43] you try to spin it, it sounds like two
[37:45] people. But then the words are so
[37:47] confusing because if you're a person who
[37:49] says there are two people, then how can
[37:52] u God be with the word and the word be
[37:56] with God and the word and the word be
[37:59] God? See, it sounds very confusing when
[38:02] you read it literally, but you've got to
[38:04] understand that. See, and if you see
[38:06] that, you can actually see that in
[38:08] Genesis 1:26 when God created man,
[38:13] Genesis 126, that there were two
[38:15] attributes, male and female created he
[38:18] them, right? And you could see that if
[38:21] we had to give that name Adam, then what
[38:23] we're saying is that the female
[38:25] attribute was with Adam or Adam was with
[38:28] that female attribute and the female
[38:30] attribute was Adam. Can you see that
[38:33] there was a a oneness there was a unity
[38:35] of two attributes. So when you speak
[38:38] about in the beginning was the word in
[38:41] the beginning that is when time began uh
[38:44] or rather that portion of time uh was
[38:47] the word the word was with God. Notice
[38:50] that the word was with God. So if you
[38:52] break that down in Genesis 1:26-27 the
[38:56] feminine attribute was with the
[38:58] masculine attribute. What does that mean
[39:01] was with?
[39:03] Okay, that doesn't mean that the they
[39:05] were side by side. That's got nothing to
[39:07] do with proximity. That's got nothing to
[39:09] do with uh physically uh they were
[39:12] holding hands or they were embracing one
[39:14] another. To be with means to be united,
[39:18] means to be one. Right? Like when Jesus
[39:22] was praying in Gethsemane and he said,
[39:25] "Father, I would that these would be
[39:28] with me as I am with you and that we may
[39:32] be one." It's such a beautiful
[39:33] scripture. If ever you read that, it is
[39:35] the complete three-fold purpose of of
[39:37] Christ. That is John 17. I think it is
[39:40] the prayer of Christ in Gethsemane.
[39:43] Now uh
[39:46] since the Bible says that God made man
[39:50] in his own image, it means that the
[39:53] father and son shared the same image and
[39:57] likeness. Right? The father and son
[40:00] attributes shared the same image and
[40:03] likeness. Okay? And we can see this as
[40:06] Christ comes in. So father and son who
[40:09] is the word existed as one. Yet the son
[40:14] or the word was in subjection to the
[40:17] father. Who's the father? The spirit.
[40:20] That means the visible part was in
[40:22] subjection to the spirit part. The
[40:25] visible part was in subjection to the
[40:27] invisible part. The word was with God
[40:31] and the word was God. Praise be to God.
[40:35] So they had a perfect harmony which made
[40:38] them one.
[40:40] Now let's read this message from the
[40:42] Pergaman church age or rather this quote
[40:45] from paragraph 2 on page 172 of your
[40:48] church age book. The prophet says notice
[40:51] the harmony of the father and the son.
[40:54] Jesus never did anything until it was
[40:57] first showed him by the father. Now,
[40:59] when you read that, you might read it
[41:02] connally and think, well, Jesus walked
[41:04] around in the world and only when the
[41:06] father told him, "Okay, now it's time to
[41:08] go to the to the well because there's a
[41:09] woman you're going to meet there." So,
[41:11] the father had to whisper something in
[41:13] his ear and then the son would say,
[41:15] "Okay, right now we're going to go."
[41:17] See, that's connality. That's not how it
[41:19] works. There's no uh uh Jesus receiving
[41:23] a specific vision that he must go to the
[41:26] well or he must hear a voice telling
[41:28] him. No, the the word and the spirit are
[41:31] one. Which means when he had the leading
[41:35] to go, it was the spirit revealing it
[41:38] inside him. This harmony existed because
[41:40] they were one, right? And so it says
[41:43] Jesus never did anything until it was
[41:45] first showed him by the father. John
[41:47] 5:19. Now watch the next phrase. This
[41:51] harmony is now to exist between the
[41:54] groom and his bride. So, we're not
[41:57] making this up, saints. What the prophet
[42:00] is saying to us is that the harmony that
[42:02] existed between father and son, between
[42:06] spirit and and and and word, between
[42:08] spirit and and Jesus who was here 2,000
[42:12] years ago, must exist between groom and
[42:14] his bride. And that goes beyond message
[42:17] culture, message tradition, going to
[42:20] message churches. that goes beyond
[42:22] reading the message, reading the word,
[42:24] having church. You're talking about a
[42:27] harmony that must exist between the word
[42:31] and the bride. And he says he shows her
[42:34] his word of life. She receives it. She
[42:37] never doubts it. Therefore, nothing can
[42:39] harm her, not even death. Now, I want to
[42:42] make this statement
[42:44] and you need to take this in slowly.
[42:47] God cannot be God without the word.
[42:53] Right? God cannot be God without the
[42:55] word. Why? Because without the word,
[42:57] what is the word? The word is the
[42:59] expression of the invisible God. We'll
[43:01] find scriptures of that uh later. So
[43:05] that means without the word nobody can
[43:08] know him as God. And if nobody can know
[43:11] him, nobody can worship him as God. That
[43:13] means he cannot be expressed without the
[43:16] word. So God needs the word to be God.
[43:20] The spirit, the eternal spirit, the
[43:22] fountain of life. He he needed the word
[43:25] to be recognized as God. Amen.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; Because the word is in subjection to the
[43:31] spirit. Therefore, there is dominion.
[43:34] There is omnipotence. Doesn't John 1:3
[43:36] says, "And all that was created was
[43:39] created by the word, and for him were
[43:41] all things created. Right? Which means
[43:44] even the spirit, the eternal spirit, the
[43:47] fountain of life created all things
[43:50] through his existing in the logos.
[43:54] Through his logos existence, he created
[43:58] all things that are. So then the word
[44:02] becomes God and everything is subject to
[44:05] the word of God and that makes the
[44:07] invisible spirit become recognized as
[44:11] God. So what are we saying saints? What
[44:14] we're saying is that if it were not for
[44:16] the word, the person and the word made
[44:19] flesh in Christ, we would never know
[44:21] God. Now there are plenty of scriptures
[44:24] for that. No man can call Jesus the
[44:26] Christ unless the spirit reveals that to
[44:29] you, right? Remember when uh Peter said
[44:33] the right thing and Christ said to him,
[44:35] "Flesh and blood did not reveal this to
[44:37] you, but my father which is in heaven."
[44:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. So u the the invisible spirit can
[44:45] only be recognized to know who God is
[44:48] can only be done by the word by seeing
[44:51] the word by recognizing the word. Amen.
[44:55] So God cannot be God without the word.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Now the word makes the spirit visible.
[45:03] That's what the scriptures are teaching
[45:04] us. Without the word the spirit cannot
[45:07] be known. Without the spirit, there is
[45:10] nothing to be made known. The spirit is
[45:14] the natures of God, invisible and
[45:17] mysterious. The word is the revelation
[45:20] of those natures. Let's say that again.
[45:23] Without the word, the spirit cannot be
[45:26] known. Right? Without the spirit, there
[45:29] is nothing to be made known. The word
[45:32] cannot express anything by itself. It is
[45:35] expressing what is what natures there
[45:38] are in the spirit. This is why Jesus
[45:39] said uh my words that I speak unto you
[45:42] are spirit and life. Okay. And the words
[45:44] that he spoke were only an extension of
[45:47] who he was. Now the spirit is the
[45:51] natures of God invisible and mysterious.
[45:55] The word is the revelation of those
[45:57] natures. Praise be to God. Let's read
[46:00] John 1:18 and see what that says. Uh
[46:03] verse 18 says, "No man had seen God at
[46:06] any time. The only begotten son which is
[46:10] in the bosom of the father, he hath
[46:13] declared him." Amen. No man had seen God
[46:17] at any time. The only begotten son which
[46:20] is in the bosom of the father, he hath
[46:22] declared him. So what is declared?
[46:25] Declare doesn't mean he came around
[46:27] talking about him. Uh no, declare means
[46:30] to make him known. So the son came out
[46:34] that was Christ remember following John
[46:36] 1:1 in the beginning was the word uh
[46:38] things were created by him there came a
[46:40] man who was witness of that word then uh
[46:44] first or rather John 1:12-14
[46:47] tells us that the word was made flesh
[46:49] and dwelt among us and then that son
[46:51] who's the only begotten of the father he
[46:54] in the bosom of the father he declared
[46:57] the father the father had no way of
[46:59] being declared except through the son.
[47:02] In other words, let's say this way, the
[47:04] invisible could not be known unless
[47:07] there was a visible part to express who
[47:11] he is.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's come back to our
[47:15] thought.
[47:17] Image means the same nature. Image means
[47:21] having the same nature, right? likeness
[47:24] means two harmonies exist or two
[47:28] attributes existing as one in harmony
[47:32] perfect harmony. So the first man, Adam,
[47:37] was a spirit man. Genesis 1:26-27. He
[47:40] was a spirit man. He was theophony man.
[47:43] He was made in God's image. He was
[47:46] theophony, right? He was also first made
[47:50] in the likeness of God. Why? Because in
[47:54] him in that theophony man were two
[47:56] natures, masculine and feminist natures
[47:59] which came from the logos. He was one
[48:01] being but he had two attributes within
[48:04] him in perfect harmony. That was the
[48:08] absolute resemblance the likeness of
[48:11] God. Father and son, male and female. Do
[48:15] you see that? Do you see why male and
[48:18] female is a likeness? Because father and
[48:21] son are two attributes. Masculine and
[48:23] feminine or male and female are two
[48:25] attributes. If you have the male and
[48:28] female in perfect harmony as father and
[48:30] son attributes are in perfect harmony,
[48:33] it's the resemblance of God. It's what
[48:36] God looks like. Amen. Which is why when
[48:39] you see a husband and wife keeping that
[48:43] um uh harmony of the marriage covenant,
[48:45] it is the resemblance of God. It is the
[48:48] mystery of Christ and the church.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; It is powerful. It can produce. It can
[48:53] create. It can create a world. can
[48:56] create a life that someone can live in.
[49:00] So these two attributes being in perfect
[49:02] harmony as one they had dominion over
[49:06] all things. Now you can read in Genesis
[49:08] 1:28 and it says you shall have dominion
[49:11] over all things. I mean you will have
[49:13] dominion over the fish of the sea, the
[49:14] birds of the air, the the creatures,
[49:17] everything. You will have dominion,
[49:20] right? Genesis 1:26-28, Adam was all
[49:24] that God is and all that makes God God.
[49:28] He was the perfect likeness of God. Yet,
[49:32] he was not God Almighty. He was an
[49:35] expression of God because he was born of
[49:38] the word. Amen.
[49:40] Now, here's something important. Though
[49:43] Adam was male and female in Genesis 1,
[49:46] there was a nature about him. So when
[49:47] you looked at him in the garden of Eden
[49:50] or rather when you looked at him there
[49:51] was a nature of him that showed the
[49:53] masculine attribute which was more
[49:55] dominant rather Genesis 1 and the female
[49:58] attribute remained less prominent. Why?
[50:02] Because the feminine attribute of man
[50:05] was always meant to be in subjection to
[50:08] the masculine attribute. Right? That's
[50:10] the it's it's not that she has a right
[50:13] to choose which way she wants to. No,
[50:15] they were made with the natures to do
[50:18] so. Like you know, it's so simple to
[50:20] understand. You're not going to find
[50:23] things in this earth that have the
[50:24] quality of working together fighting
[50:27] against one another. For example,
[50:30] you're not going to find negative uh
[50:32] charges and positive charges saying no,
[50:35] I don't want to behave this way. I don't
[50:37] want electricity to flow. When there's
[50:40] an opportunity, they line up and
[50:42] electricity flows. You're not going to
[50:44] find uh uh in magnetism the north pole
[50:47] saying I want to be a south pole or the
[50:50] south pole saying I want to be a north
[50:51] pole. You're never going to have that.
[50:53] So why is it that in humans you have the
[50:57] the ability in humans where females say
[50:59] well I don't want to accept the the
[51:01] subjection of the male or or rather I
[51:04] don't want to be in submission to the
[51:05] male. I don't or in today's world I want
[51:08] to I don't want to be a female. I want
[51:09] to be a male. I don't want to be a male.
[51:11] I want to be a female. You'll never see
[51:13] that in any other expression of this in
[51:17] the world.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you look at Adam, though
[51:22] Adam was male and female in Genesis 1,
[51:24] when you looked at him, the masculine
[51:26] was more dominant because the female was
[51:29] in perfect submission. So notice this is
[51:32] the same with the father and the word.
[51:34] If you could see the logos with your
[51:36] naked eye, you would be looking at God
[51:39] because you'll see the power of the
[51:41] father. You would you would be seeing
[51:43] his divine nature. You would be
[51:45] absorbing his divine nature in because
[51:48] the word is in the background. The word
[51:50] is in submission. You would see the
[51:53] works of the father. Remember when when
[51:55] Christ said uh and and you can you can
[51:58] remember this from the from his words uh
[52:00] from the scripture. He said uh you know
[52:03] don't judge me for what I'm saying. He
[52:05] said look my works tell you who I am
[52:08] because I do the works of the father.
[52:10] look at the works and judge them. And
[52:11] they said, "Well, we're not interested
[52:13] in what your works are, but you saying
[52:15] that you are the son of God. We have a
[52:17] problem with that. You being a man say
[52:20] that you're God, we have a problem with
[52:21] that." Which means they had a problem
[52:23] with the visible part. They had a
[52:26] problem with what the visible part were
[52:28] saying. They had a problem with with
[52:30] what the word was saying. They had no no
[52:33] issue with the miracles and the
[52:35] healings. They were saying yes that's
[52:36] from God but what you were saying we
[52:38] take offense with that. So um all that
[52:43] Christ was even doing was saying I give
[52:45] glory to the father. I give glory to the
[52:47] spirit. I give glory to the invisible.
[52:50] Notice this is the same with the father
[52:52] and the word. If you see the logos now
[52:55] like I said with the naked eye you're
[52:57] going to see God because the word being
[53:00] in submission to that spirit. the word
[53:02] will say nothing else except what the
[53:04] spirit reveals. So this is the same
[53:06] reason that Adam had dominion because
[53:09] because this harmony that exists between
[53:11] the two attributes uh is there that is
[53:15] the likeness of God and I I don't want
[53:18] you to downplay this. I want you to see
[53:20] the reality of this. When these two
[53:22] harmonies or these two attributes are in
[53:24] perfect harmony, this is the resemblance
[53:27] of God, people. This is a big thing.
[53:30] This isn't a small thing. If it is the
[53:32] resemblance of God, there's going to be
[53:33] power that comes forth from there.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; So, when Eve was pulled out of Adam, now
[53:39] things are becoming complicated. Things
[53:41] are changing. When the woman was pulled,
[53:43] when the woman's body was separated from
[53:46] the man's body, that's when man became
[53:49] in the image of God but after his
[53:52] likeness. Why? The likeness of God was
[53:55] actually the two attributes dwelling in
[53:57] one body. But now you separated. There
[54:00] are two bodies. Now, how are they going
[54:03] to keep that likeness? How are they
[54:06] going to keep that perfect harmony while
[54:08] being two separate bodies? See? So
[54:11] notice the woman of Genesis 2 was not
[54:14] the image of God. Now she was the image
[54:15] of Adam of Genesis 2 because she was the
[54:18] same material as Adam. When Adam saw
[54:21] her, he said, "You are bone of my bone,
[54:22] flesh of my flesh. You shall be called
[54:25] woman because you came out of man." So
[54:26] she was actually the image of man.
[54:29] Right? But in theophony, they were the
[54:32] image of God. The flesh body was the
[54:34] image of man. But because Adam and his
[54:37] wife were in perfect harmony with the
[54:39] word, their theophony was married to
[54:43] their flesh. That was heaven and earth
[54:45] embrace. So when they were glorified
[54:47] body because they had connection to
[54:50] their theophony that fleshly body had
[54:52] connection to their theophony and that
[54:54] made them powerful. That made them God
[54:57] on earth. And as long as Adam and his
[55:00] wife had that harmony, they kept that
[55:03] theophony. Amen.
[55:06] Now I know you know all these things. So
[55:08] the woman however could not be the image
[55:12] of God on her own. But Adam was see
[55:18] she was part of him. For her to be the
[55:21] image of God she had to be a part of
[55:24] Adam. She had to be Adam. So even though
[55:28] now here was the here was the the the
[55:30] difficulty now being separated into a
[55:34] separate body she had to still be Adam
[55:38] to be a part of God's image. Let's read
[55:41] 1 Corinthians 11
[55:43] and verse 7. It says for a man indeed
[55:46] ought not to cover his head for as much.
[55:48] Now watch these words. As much as he is
[55:51] the image and the glory of God. See,
[55:54] it's saying that the man is the image
[55:56] and the glory of God. Glory means
[55:58] expression. He's the expression of God.
[56:01] But the woman is the glory of the man.
[56:05] She is the expression. She is the
[56:07] beauty. She is the uh the splendor of
[56:09] the man. She is the expression. She is
[56:12] the body through which a man can express
[56:14] himself through. Right? So man is the
[56:18] image and glory of God. But the woman is
[56:20] the glory of the man. So if the woman
[56:22] has to be God, she has to be a part of
[56:24] the man. Amen. So this scripture shows
[56:27] us that the ideal spiritual condition,
[56:31] excuse me, of the man, it shows us what
[56:34] the spiritual condition of the man and
[56:35] woman should be. Now he man is to be
[56:41] like God on this earth. He's supposed to
[56:43] have dominion. He's supposed to be above
[56:46] sin, above unbelief by displaying faith
[56:50] in the word. And she is supposed to be
[56:53] an expression of the man by displaying
[56:56] faith in the man. And that's just
[56:59] looking at a man and a woman who are
[57:01] married, right? And as long as they keep
[57:04] that, they can be the likeness of God.
[57:08] Notice she was not Adam's likeness
[57:11] because she was female. Right? So now
[57:14] when you separated them, here was Adam,
[57:16] there was the woman. They looked very
[57:19] different. And now you could see the
[57:21] difference. He was tall, burly,
[57:23] muscular,
[57:25] um, short hair. She was feminine,
[57:28] softer, shorter, long hair, different
[57:32] voice, different body structure,
[57:35] different organs. They were completely
[57:37] different in likeness. Right?
[57:41] So she was in his image though because
[57:43] she had she was bone of his bones, same
[57:46] flesh and blood, same DNA, same
[57:49] everything in terms of makeup, in terms
[57:52] of nature, in terms of character, in
[57:54] terms of makeup of the body, she was the
[57:56] image of Adam, but she was of a
[57:59] different likeness. Right? So in talk in
[58:01] terms of what she looked like but more
[58:05] than that she had his spirit because the
[58:08] spirit in her was taken from him. You
[58:11] know the prophet says these things in
[58:13] rising of the sun and different
[58:14] messages. The nature in her was from
[58:19] him. Right? The the the feminist nature.
[58:22] The prophet says God separated the
[58:25] feminist nature from him. Took it out
[58:27] and put it into the woman the body of
[58:29] the woman. All right. So, notice
[58:31] something. All the way from Genesis 1
[58:34] through to Genesis 2, we have no idea
[58:36] how many years that took, perhaps
[58:38] hundreds of years. As long as she was
[58:40] within the man and not separated, their
[58:43] existence was in the image of God and in
[58:47] the likeness of God. But after she was
[58:50] separated into a different body,
[58:53] then they were in the image of God and
[58:56] after the likeness. That means the
[58:58] likeness that they had in Genesis 2
[59:00] being in separate fleshly bodies was not
[59:03] the absolute likeness of God. Why?
[59:06] Because it was not perfect harmony. They
[59:09] were two separate beings who could
[59:12] choose to go this way in the morning and
[59:13] then the other go the other way in the
[59:15] morning. They they could spend a whole
[59:18] week apart walking through the earth. So
[59:21] they were not in the same body anymore.
[59:24] So why were they after the likeness?
[59:26] Because God instituted something called
[59:29] marriage covenant
[59:31] together because of the marriage
[59:33] covenant. The vows that they would be
[59:36] one flesh by honoring marriage covenant
[59:39] they had to remain one flesh united in
[59:42] character in thinking. So what does the
[59:44] marriage covenant actually mean? The
[59:46] woman vows to follow the leading of the
[59:50] man to let him be her headship to um uh
[59:55] um in other words submit to what his
[59:59] desires are for the earth at the time.
[1:00:01] If you're looking at their situation,
[1:00:03] she could not do anything she wanted to
[1:00:05] do without discussing things with him.
[1:00:08] uh if we make this like a real you know
[1:00:10] husband and wife situation at the same
[1:00:12] time his duty is to provide for her to
[1:00:15] make the earth a more pleasant place to
[1:00:18] make her happy you know that was the
[1:00:21] marriage vows between them and as long
[1:00:24] as they kept those vows they kept the
[1:00:27] likeness of God of course it was after
[1:00:29] the likeness was not ideal it was
[1:00:32] permitted it what would have been ideal
[1:00:35] is if she remained in him Right? That
[1:00:38] would have been the perfect likeness of
[1:00:40] God. Now in that condition where they
[1:00:44] were separated in body, it brought in
[1:00:48] the loophole for something to happen.
[1:00:51] And we all know what that is. We call
[1:00:53] that the fall. So here's where I want to
[1:00:55] bring us to. The image and the likeness
[1:00:59] was lost from mankind. Amen. That's what
[1:01:03] we find. The likeness of God was marred
[1:01:06] by adultery. When Eve committed
[1:01:09] adultery, she marred the likeness of
[1:01:12] God. She broke the likeness of God. And
[1:01:15] breaking the likeness of God broke the
[1:01:18] ability to have dominion. It broke the
[1:01:21] ability to have control over all
[1:01:22] dimensions. Breaking the marriage
[1:01:25] covenant was breaking the likeness of
[1:01:27] God. It brought in a son that did not
[1:01:30] belong to this man, to the real
[1:01:32] headship.
[1:01:34] Then when Adam chose to do what his wife
[1:01:38] asked him to do, he disobeying
[1:01:42] lost the image.
[1:01:44] Theophony was separated from them. And
[1:01:47] when theophony was taken off them, they
[1:01:49] were just flesh man. And you know what
[1:01:52] the prophet said in COD said, you know,
[1:01:55] when you take the Holy Ghost off a man,
[1:01:57] he becomes brute beast. And you know
[1:02:00] what he says in there? He said, "You
[1:02:01] take a man who's brute beast, he can uh
[1:02:04] throw a woman's baby from her and ravage
[1:02:06] her and so on." You remember those
[1:02:07] quotes? He's trying to say that's not
[1:02:10] the real nature of man. That's the
[1:02:11] that's the nature of the flesh, the
[1:02:13] beast coming out. Amen. So, the image of
[1:02:17] God was lost when Adam chose his will
[1:02:21] over the will of the word. Now, watch
[1:02:23] those two things. Now, if we want to
[1:02:25] know what the vision is at the end time,
[1:02:27] we have to remember these two things.
[1:02:30] The likeness was lost. The image was
[1:02:32] lost. In this day, why are you here?
[1:02:37] Why are you here? What is the purpose of
[1:02:39] the bride?
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's go on. When she caused
[1:02:46] Adam to lay with her, he disobeyed the
[1:02:49] word because laying with her meant
[1:02:53] eating of the tree of knowledge of good
[1:02:55] and evil. It meant choosing to procreate
[1:02:58] by his own will and not bring forth
[1:03:00] predestinated sons but rather bringing
[1:03:02] forth children of their own will uh and
[1:03:05] procreating. So when she caused Adam to
[1:03:08] lay with her, he disobeyed the word. He
[1:03:10] chose his own will. He lost the offony.
[1:03:13] He relinquished the offering because his
[1:03:15] theophony was now forfeit and went back
[1:03:16] to the original owner. He could no
[1:03:19] longer be a part of the word. So if he
[1:03:23] was no longer in harmony with the word,
[1:03:26] he could no longer be the word, right?
[1:03:29] Because he chose to disobey the will of
[1:03:31] the word and live by his own will. You
[1:03:33] know, they were kicked out of the garden
[1:03:35] of Eden, not because of the adultery,
[1:03:37] but because in I think it was Genesis 3
[1:03:41] uh 20 onwards where he said the man can
[1:03:44] no longer be in the garden because he is
[1:03:48] as one of us.
[1:03:51] uh choosing to do his own will. In other
[1:03:52] words, he cho he's choosing to be God to
[1:03:55] himself. What is that? He's choosing to
[1:03:57] live by his own will. He is choosing not
[1:04:00] to be in harmony with the word, right?
[1:04:03] And that's why he was sent out of the
[1:04:05] garden. Now, let's read
[1:04:08] what the prophet says in the message uh
[1:04:10] the bridge message, the brereech between
[1:04:12] the seven church ages and the seven
[1:04:14] seals. This is preached in 1963. a
[1:04:17] famous or rather familiar message to us.
[1:04:20] Beautiful message to us. Let's read
[1:04:22] paragraph 99. And it says, "Now when
[1:04:25] Adam sinned by heeding his wife's
[1:04:27] reasoning instead of holding to God's
[1:04:30] word, that's what made Adam sin. His
[1:04:34] wife reasoned with Satan and then
[1:04:37] produced the product to Adam and Adam
[1:04:39] turned loose the word and sold out. He
[1:04:42] he lost also his inheritance when he
[1:04:44] lost his fellowship and right to life."
[1:04:46] So notice, look at these words. He lost
[1:04:48] his inheritance when he lost his
[1:04:50] fellowship and his right to life. Now
[1:04:52] what was his inheritance? His
[1:04:54] inheritance was earth. What was his
[1:04:56] fellowship? His fellowship was his
[1:04:58] oneness with God. His right to life. His
[1:05:01] fellowship is and his right to life his
[1:05:03] theophony. Right? So uh when he turned
[1:05:07] loose the word and sold out, he lost his
[1:05:09] theophony. That's what the prophet is
[1:05:10] saying. He says, "Remember the day you
[1:05:12] eat thereof, that day you die." And when
[1:05:16] he lost his life, he also lost his
[1:05:19] inheritance in life because he had
[1:05:21] complete supreme control that is
[1:05:24] dominion of the earth. He was God of the
[1:05:28] earth. God's the God of the universe and
[1:05:30] everywhere. But his son Adam had this
[1:05:34] earth under his control. He could speak,
[1:05:37] he could name, he could say, he could
[1:05:39] stop nature, he could do anything he
[1:05:41] wanted to. But when he did that, he lost
[1:05:44] his inheritance. So this is to show you
[1:05:47] that
[1:05:49] man lost the image of God and the nature
[1:05:53] and the likeness of God. Now God
[1:05:55] remember God's desire was to make man in
[1:05:58] his image and after his likeness. That
[1:06:01] was God's desire. So man by his own will
[1:06:04] chose to relinquish the image of God and
[1:06:07] the likeness of God. Right? Now looks
[1:06:11] look what happens after the fall.
[1:06:13] They've got no more likeness. They've
[1:06:16] got no more harmony. Now God is to bring
[1:06:18] a law. And he says to the man, "By the
[1:06:21] sweat of your brow, now you are going to
[1:06:23] work to provide for your family and you,
[1:06:26] the woman, you will you will bring forth
[1:06:28] children in pain, and your desire shall
[1:06:32] be to the man." It's a law that if you
[1:06:35] break it, you are going to be judged for
[1:06:36] it. Prior to that, it wasn't a law. It
[1:06:39] was nature. It was a choice. It was a
[1:06:42] covenant. It was a marriage covenant.
[1:06:44] But now God made it the law such that if
[1:06:46] the woman did not subject herself to to
[1:06:49] the man, there was going to be serious
[1:06:50] consequences.
[1:06:53] So no more likeness, no more harmony
[1:06:56] between male and female. Dominion of
[1:06:59] earth was lost. You know, that's why
[1:07:02] uh people in this world today are are
[1:07:05] lost. They're depressed constantly
[1:07:08] throughout the world. The majority of
[1:07:09] earth's people are living in depression,
[1:07:12] in sorrow, unhappy, purposeless,
[1:07:17] uh waiting for governments to show them
[1:07:19] direction, waiting for spiritual leaders
[1:07:21] to give them direction. No man feels he
[1:07:24] has control over his own soul. You know,
[1:07:26] it's so bad. You buy a house, you pay
[1:07:30] the money, and still it's not yours. You
[1:07:32] got to pay rates and taxes to the
[1:07:34] government. You got to pay for the land
[1:07:36] you thought you already paid for. And
[1:07:37] for the rest of your life, you have to
[1:07:39] protect it. You have to protect it from
[1:07:41] other people. There's just no freedom.
[1:07:44] Men and women today are so under a cloud
[1:07:47] of depression.
[1:07:49] And that's the kind of this is the kind
[1:07:51] of world that God has brought this
[1:07:54] message to us in. Right? So after the
[1:07:58] fall, man has no more theophonic
[1:08:01] representation. In in other words, man
[1:08:03] has no connection to theophony. It is so
[1:08:06] bad that can you believe that in this
[1:08:09] day God's creation
[1:08:12] is saying God does not exist.
[1:08:16] That that's going to make you sit back
[1:08:19] and just ponder for a while. There's no
[1:08:23] other creation in this world that's
[1:08:24] that's saying God does not exist.
[1:08:26] They're doing everything that even if
[1:08:29] it's the dogs and the cats and the and
[1:08:31] the the other insects in the in in the
[1:08:33] in the universe or in the earth and the
[1:08:36] the trees and the water and everything
[1:08:38] is doing its purpose. Just man sits back
[1:08:42] and says, "Well, I choose not to believe
[1:08:45] in God anymore. I choose not to believe
[1:08:47] in the message. I choose not to follow
[1:08:48] the the word of the prophet anymore. I
[1:08:50] choose to believe that the prophet is
[1:08:52] wrong. I can prove that he's where do
[1:08:55] you get something like that?
[1:08:58] It's because man has no connection to
[1:09:00] theophony.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; He's got no image of God. He's living by
[1:09:05] the image of of of of animal. Therefore,
[1:09:09] he he's so uh lost that that he can
[1:09:14] think in his reasonable mind or he's in
[1:09:16] reasoning mind. He can say to himself,
[1:09:18] "Well, today I choose to not believe the
[1:09:21] word. I choose to believe something
[1:09:23] else. It's tragic. It's it's a
[1:09:27] phenomenon to to to think that something
[1:09:29] like this could ever happen.
[1:09:31] No more theophonic representation. No
[1:09:34] more image of God. Man no longer is in
[1:09:37] touch with the natures of God. Think of
[1:09:40] it. For thousands of years, man has lost
[1:09:44] uh the the connection to the natures of
[1:09:48] God. He began to explain God away so
[1:09:51] terribly that now God exists as a
[1:09:54] figment of his imagination and he's man
[1:09:57] who started to believe that that he
[1:10:00] knows what God is and he began to live a
[1:10:02] lie and worship a lie such that the
[1:10:06] natures that are being produced by the
[1:10:08] lie that he created about what God is is
[1:10:11] producing such terrible natures in that
[1:10:14] mankind is falling faster than it's ever
[1:10:17] it's ever fallen before now this has
[1:10:20] left man vulnerable to the nature of
[1:10:22] beasts because without the image of God
[1:10:25] man is merely the image of beast and
[1:10:27] that's what I was referring to where
[1:10:29] brother says that in cood page 20
[1:10:31] paragraph 55 now watch what happens to
[1:10:34] men after the fall all men who are now
[1:10:38] being born are born in the likeness of
[1:10:41] Adam so you me brothers we are born in
[1:10:44] the likeness of Adam right we resemble
[1:10:47] the first man but we are after his
[1:10:51] image. Now if you look at Seth was born
[1:10:53] after Adam he was born after the image
[1:10:56] of his father and then Seth's sons were
[1:10:58] born after the image of Seth and then
[1:11:00] those who were born after the image of
[1:11:01] their father as it went away further and
[1:11:04] further and further. it went further and
[1:11:06] further away from the image of the first
[1:11:08] man such that by Noah's day and by uh
[1:11:14] Nimrod's day they were already creating
[1:11:18] different laws for what man should live
[1:11:19] like I mean you're just speaking of
[1:11:22] 2,000 years after Adam just 2,000 years
[1:11:24] after Adam and they were already uh far
[1:11:28] away from what the original nature of
[1:11:30] Adam was in fact a thousand years away
[1:11:34] from Adam, you come to Noah and uh in in
[1:11:39] that time, God was already fed up, so to
[1:11:42] say, with the nature of man. As more men
[1:11:46] were born, their natures were going
[1:11:48] further away from Adam's nature. Cain
[1:11:50] was the father of his own lineage. And
[1:11:52] as men were born in Cain's lineage, they
[1:11:54] went from bad to worse. If you read with
[1:11:57] me Genesis 6:1-9, and it says, "And it
[1:11:59] came to pass when men began to multiply
[1:12:01] on the face of the earth, and daughters
[1:12:03] were born unto them that the sons of God
[1:12:06] saw the daughters of men that they were
[1:12:08] fair, and they took them wives of all
[1:12:10] which they chose." And the Lord said,
[1:12:12] "My spirit shall not always strive with
[1:12:14] man, for that he also is flesh." Yet his
[1:12:18] days shall be an 120 years. There were
[1:12:22] giants in the earth in those days, and
[1:12:24] also after that, when the sons of God
[1:12:26] came in unto the daughters of men, and
[1:12:28] they bare children to them, and and the
[1:12:30] same became mighty men, which were of
[1:12:32] old, men of renown. And God saw that the
[1:12:35] wickedness of man was great in the
[1:12:37] earth, and that every imagination of the
[1:12:40] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:12:42] continually. Saints, we're talking about
[1:12:45] just a thousand years after Adam. And
[1:12:47] these men were living to almost a
[1:12:50] thousand years old. So just not even a
[1:12:54] thousand years. And man became so wicked
[1:12:58] in sons being born after the likeness
[1:13:00] after the likeness after the image after
[1:13:02] the image of their fathers. The the
[1:13:05] original nature of man was totally lost
[1:13:08] when it came time to the flood. And God
[1:13:10] had no choice. If you read verse uh
[1:13:12] seven, and the Lord said, I will destroy
[1:13:15] man whom I have created from the face of
[1:13:17] the earth, both man and beast and
[1:13:19] creeping thing, and the fowls of the
[1:13:21] air, for it repenteth me that I have
[1:13:23] made them. But Noah found grace in the
[1:13:26] eyes of the Lord. These are the
[1:13:27] generations of Noah. Noah was a just man
[1:13:30] and perfect in his generations. So Noah
[1:13:32] actually found grace uh
[1:13:35] in in in the eyes of God because he was
[1:13:38] perfect in his generations. Now watch
[1:13:40] that. And it said, "And Noah walked with
[1:13:44] God."
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Noah walked with God. How is that? How
[1:13:49] is it that Noah walked with God? How is
[1:13:51] it that Enoch walked with God? What does
[1:13:54] it mean? Now, this you're talking about
[1:13:56] walking in the vision, being one with
[1:13:59] what the word revealed for that day,
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; being in perfect harmony, being in
[1:14:04] union. Noah walked with God.
[1:14:07] So man was becoming worse because they
[1:14:10] began to mix the bloodlines even more by
[1:14:13] crossbreeding thus sending man even
[1:14:15] further into the nature of beasts. Men
[1:14:18] like Noah only found grace because they
[1:14:20] kept their lineages straight. So at that
[1:14:22] time the vision for Noah's day was to
[1:14:25] keep the lineages straight. You to walk
[1:14:28] in that. That was walking with God.
[1:14:30] Romans 1 verse 18-32. It's a long
[1:14:33] scripture, but I want to read just a few
[1:14:35] verses there to show you, and we can
[1:14:37] skip to the end. Romans 1:18-32.
[1:14:41] For the wrath of God is revealed from
[1:14:43] heaven against all ungodliness
[1:14:46] and unrighteousness of men who hold the
[1:14:49] truth in unrighteousness, because that
[1:14:51] which may be known of God is manifest in
[1:14:54] them. For God has showed it unto them.
[1:14:56] Now watch this. For the invisible things
[1:15:00] of him who the invisible things of God
[1:15:04] from the creation of the world that
[1:15:05] means from before time began are clearly
[1:15:08] seen. What does that mean? H how is the
[1:15:11] invisible become clearly seen? Because
[1:15:13] Christ was manifested.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; That's what Paul is saying. The
[1:15:17] invisible things the father is being
[1:15:19] declared
[1:15:20] being understood by the things that are
[1:15:23] made. In other words, the things that
[1:15:25] were invisible are understood by the
[1:15:26] things that are formed by the visible.
[1:15:29] Right? Even his eternal power and
[1:15:32] godhead. So that in other words, Paul is
[1:15:35] saying men is without excuse because
[1:15:37] Christ has been manifested. Because when
[1:15:40] they knew God, verse 21, they glorified
[1:15:43] him not as God. That's from the
[1:15:45] beginning. Neither were they thankful
[1:15:47] but became vain in their imaginations.
[1:15:49] That's what I was telling you. Uh they
[1:15:51] began to fantasize, create lies of who
[1:15:53] God was and live by their own lies. And
[1:15:55] their foolish heart was darkened.
[1:15:58] Professing themselves to be wise, they
[1:15:59] became fools. They changed the glory of
[1:16:02] the uncorruptible God into, watch the
[1:16:05] words, an image made like to corruptible
[1:16:08] man and to birds and for-footed beasts
[1:16:10] and creeping things. Now, why do they do
[1:16:13] this? Because in their minds they began
[1:16:15] to create images
[1:16:17] or more accurately likenesses.
[1:16:20] They want to see what God looks like.
[1:16:22] They want to claim what God looks like.
[1:16:24] So they started making uh uh idols of
[1:16:28] birds and animals and male and female
[1:16:31] and men and women and for-footed beasts
[1:16:34] and creeping things. They started
[1:16:35] looking at those things and making idols
[1:16:37] out of those things. And why? Because
[1:16:40] man was desperate to see what God looks
[1:16:42] like, to know what God is. So they made
[1:16:45] up lies and they made up idols to say
[1:16:47] this is who he is and created ways of
[1:16:50] worshiping him. And of course this
[1:16:53] scripture tells us how tragic that was
[1:16:55] that by doing that from verse 24 onwards
[1:16:58] it tells you wherefore God gave them up
[1:17:01] to uncleanness. That means they they
[1:17:02] began to live by lust dishonoring
[1:17:05] themselves. Verse 25 said they changed
[1:17:07] the truth of God into a lie and
[1:17:09] worshiped the served the creature more
[1:17:11] than the creator. They became they
[1:17:13] changed the natural use of men and
[1:17:15] women. Uh they brought in homosexuality
[1:17:17] even as verse 28 says even as they did
[1:17:20] not like to retain God in their
[1:17:21] knowledge. God gave them over to
[1:17:23] reprobate mind being filled with
[1:17:25] unrighteousness. verse 29, you know,
[1:17:28] fornication, wickedness, and then it
[1:17:30] goes on from verse 29 to verse 32
[1:17:32] telling you what terrible natures came
[1:17:35] upon man because they changed the image
[1:17:39] of God
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; because they they used another image and
[1:17:44] they used another likeness. This is
[1:17:46] telling you the reason for the world's
[1:17:48] corruption today is they have corrupted
[1:17:51] what the image and the likeness of God
[1:17:53] really is. All these natures of
[1:17:55] backbiting, haters, despiteful, proud,
[1:17:58] boasters, inventors of evil things,
[1:18:00] disobedient apparent without
[1:18:02] understanding, foolish, silly, covenant
[1:18:05] breakers, people who lie, give you their
[1:18:07] word and break that without natural
[1:18:09] affection, implacable,
[1:18:12] unmerciful. All these natures exist
[1:18:15] because they changed what the real image
[1:18:18] of God is, because they changed what the
[1:18:20] likeness of God is. And God was very
[1:18:22] severe about the saints. If you and I
[1:18:25] want to live in the vision today, how do
[1:18:27] we change these natures that are
[1:18:29] existing in our flesh? There is only one
[1:18:31] way. The image in the likeness of God
[1:18:34] must be restored to us.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; And that must be where our vision is.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; If you look at the idea of adoption,
[1:18:41] this is the purpose of adoption. The
[1:18:44] sons of God now have to be taught the
[1:18:46] word. The word is to come back. The
[1:18:49] image has to be brought to us by us
[1:18:51] hearing the word. Amen. Because we
[1:18:54] couldn't just take theophony being so uh
[1:18:58] diseased with sin. We have to now hear
[1:19:01] the word and believe. And as we believe,
[1:19:04] we get drawn closer to theophony. Heaven
[1:19:08] comes closer and we move closer to
[1:19:10] heaven. See that is heaven is theophony.
[1:19:13] So the more we learn, the more we
[1:19:15] believe in the word, it starts to change
[1:19:17] the nature in us away from that nature
[1:19:20] that was corrupt. So hearing the true
[1:19:24] revelation of the word for this day
[1:19:26] brings us back to the image of God.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; By achieving the image of God, which is
[1:19:31] theophony, man can overcome sin, which
[1:19:34] is unbelief. By receiving the image, we
[1:19:38] can choose to do the will of God again,
[1:19:40] which is what Adam chose not to do. Our
[1:19:43] duty here is to choose the will of God
[1:19:45] when the word is revealed. And that will
[1:19:47] begin to put the nature of God back into
[1:19:50] the flesh. That will take back. So the
[1:19:52] the flesh now will take back the nature
[1:19:54] of God, the image of God coming in. This
[1:19:57] will give start to bring dominion over
[1:19:59] spiritual things,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; over all things concerning the word.
[1:20:04] Adoption is the process that restores
[1:20:06] the image of the father to his sons.
[1:20:10] Thereby we have the spirit of adoption
[1:20:12] whereby we can cry aba. That means only
[1:20:16] when the spirit of adoption comes in can
[1:20:18] we recognize our father. When it says we
[1:20:22] can cry aba it means then we can
[1:20:24] identify hey that's where I come from.
[1:20:26] That's where I really am.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; That's where I really come from. So the
[1:20:30] image is restored by hearing the voice
[1:20:33] of God. God purposed it to be. So
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; let's bring this to a close.
[1:20:40] In Deuteronomy 4:12-19, so that's going
[1:20:43] way back when God first brought in the
[1:20:46] law. Look at what he says. And the Lord
[1:20:49] spake unto you. This is Moses. I would
[1:20:52] say he's he's he's admonishing the
[1:20:55] children of Israel. He's shouting at
[1:20:57] them. He is warning them. He's being
[1:20:59] grievous. He's being really serious.
[1:21:02] He's he's really putting it all in. He's
[1:21:04] he's telling them uh in in the most
[1:21:06] serious way possible because this is the
[1:21:09] most important thing. Verse 12. And the
[1:21:12] Lord spake unto you out of the midst of
[1:21:14] the fire, you heard the voice of words
[1:21:16] but saw no similitude. Similitude means
[1:21:20] you saw no likeness. You saw no uh uh
[1:21:23] form of something. He says, "You only
[1:21:26] heard a voice." And he declared unto his
[1:21:29] covenant, which he commanded you to
[1:21:31] perform, even ten commandments, and he
[1:21:33] wrote them upon two tables of stone. And
[1:21:35] the Lord commanded me at the time to
[1:21:37] teach you statutes and judgments that
[1:21:38] you might do them in the land whether
[1:21:40] you go over to possess it. Take you
[1:21:43] therefore good heed unto yourselves, for
[1:21:45] you saw no manner of similitude. Here it
[1:21:47] is again. He said, he's warning them
[1:21:50] again. He says, take heed to yourselves.
[1:21:54] You saw no similitude. You saw no
[1:21:56] likeness. You saw no image, no form. You
[1:21:59] only heard a voice out of the midst of
[1:22:01] the fire. Right? When the Lord spake in
[1:22:03] Horeb, verse 16, lest you corrupt
[1:22:07] yourselves and make you a graven image.
[1:22:09] Now, you know, people in this world
[1:22:11] today in even in the message would say,
[1:22:13] well, I haven't made a graven image. I
[1:22:16] don't make graven images. Uh, you know,
[1:22:19] but listen, a graven image is a figment
[1:22:22] of your imagination.
[1:22:23] You can corrupt your natures by choosing
[1:22:27] to believe God is something that someone
[1:22:29] else is telling you or someone else is
[1:22:32] preaching to you a nature of God that is
[1:22:35] not the nature of God.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; That is a graven image.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; That is a a wrong image. That is a
[1:22:41] similitude of another figure.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; So he says you corrupt yourselves and
[1:22:46] make you a graven image. the similitude
[1:22:48] of any figure, the likeness of male or
[1:22:51] female, the likeness of any beast that
[1:22:53] is on the earth, the likeness of any
[1:22:55] winged fowl that flyth in the air, the
[1:22:57] likeness of anything that creepeth on
[1:22:58] the ground, the likeness of any fish.
[1:23:00] Notice all those words: image, likeness,
[1:23:02] image, likeness.
[1:23:05] Verse 19, lest thou lift up thine eyes
[1:23:07] unto heaven. God is so specific. He
[1:23:09] tells you about all the creatures of the
[1:23:11] earth. He tells you about men and women.
[1:23:13] He tells you now verse 19 about the
[1:23:15] stars of heaven. You're going to worship
[1:23:18] those things, you're going to create
[1:23:19] those things as likenesses and images,
[1:23:21] you're going to corrupt yourself. And
[1:23:24] God gives a clear warning here that we
[1:23:26] should not be doing that. Amen. Now,
[1:23:29] this was the reason that God was so much
[1:23:31] against appearing in forms. Saints, I
[1:23:34] want to make this clear to you. When God
[1:23:36] uh uh appeared as a cloud, they
[1:23:39] worshiped the cloud. But the cloud was a
[1:23:41] veil in which God was speaking through.
[1:23:44] when he appeared in the pillar of fire.
[1:23:46] They worshiped the pillar of fire. They
[1:23:48] made that an idol. Do you know that
[1:23:50] during the time of the um the marsh
[1:23:52] through the wilderness, they they
[1:23:54] created an ark cult because God
[1:23:58] instructed them to create the ark. A
[1:24:01] whole lot of people around began to
[1:24:02] create this ark cult because they
[1:24:04] believe now God lived in this box. See,
[1:24:07] they started making idols of the box. If
[1:24:10] you look at the world today, um the the
[1:24:14] the church in the church ages created an
[1:24:17] idol of the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:24:18] Christ. All the the figures, the cross,
[1:24:22] the crucifix, the pictures, this all
[1:24:25] pictures, forms, uh likenesses which
[1:24:29] they look to and their faith is limited
[1:24:32] because they are limited by the likeness
[1:24:34] of what they're looking at, right? And
[1:24:36] they cannot see past that. The reason
[1:24:38] why people have no revelation of the
[1:24:40] word is because they're limited by what
[1:24:42] they are looking at. Visible images and
[1:24:45] likenesses lead to corruption and false
[1:24:48] doctrines. There is a true image and
[1:24:51] there is a true likeness that must be
[1:24:53] restored to us. When you know what that
[1:24:55] is, how it returns to you, you will have
[1:24:58] sight. You will have vision and you will
[1:25:01] have more direction and purpose in the
[1:25:03] things that you do for him and in the
[1:25:05] way you live your life.
[1:25:08] Allah's scripture there in Deuteronomy
[1:25:10] 4:25-31
[1:25:14] he says when thou shalt be get children
[1:25:16] this is beautiful and children's
[1:25:18] children and you shall have remained
[1:25:20] long in the land and shall corrupt
[1:25:22] yourselves and make a graven image or
[1:25:24] the likeness of anything and shall do
[1:25:26] evil watch that if so God is telling
[1:25:28] them when you've been long in the land
[1:25:31] you've been long in the message you've
[1:25:32] been long in the word you make a graven
[1:25:34] image and a likeness of anything and
[1:25:36] shall do evil in the sight of God to
[1:25:38] provoke him to anger. I call heaven and
[1:25:41] earth to witness against you this day,
[1:25:42] that you shall soon utterly perish from
[1:25:45] of the land where unto you go over
[1:25:47] Jordan to possess it. You shall not
[1:25:49] prolong your days upon it, but shall
[1:25:50] utterly be destroyed. And the Lord shall
[1:25:53] scatter you among the nations, and you
[1:25:54] shall be left few in number among the
[1:25:56] heathen, whether the Lord shall lead
[1:25:58] you. And there you shall serve other you
[1:26:00] shall serve gods, the work of men's
[1:26:03] hands and wood and stone which neither
[1:26:04] see nor hear nor eat nor smell. Um but
[1:26:08] if from if from then so this is this is
[1:26:11] telling us saints this is a promise to
[1:26:12] us. If you've come to the place where
[1:26:15] you've been so messed up with, maybe you
[1:26:17] came from Catholicism or Methodist or
[1:26:20] even a false doctrine of the message or
[1:26:23] someplace you came from somewhere and
[1:26:25] you were serving God out of a wrong
[1:26:27] image in a wrong likeness and a wrong
[1:26:29] understanding. But from that place,
[1:26:32] verse 29, if from thence thou shalt seek
[1:26:35] the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him.
[1:26:37] If thou seek him with all thy heart and
[1:26:39] with all thy soul, when thou are in
[1:26:41] tribulation, all these things are come
[1:26:43] upon thee, even in the latter days, that
[1:26:46] is the last days. If thou turn to the
[1:26:48] Lord thy God, and shall be obedient to
[1:26:50] his voice. For the Lord thy God is a
[1:26:53] merciful God, he will not forsake thee,
[1:26:56] neither destroy thee, nor forget the
[1:26:58] covenant of thy fathers, which he swear
[1:27:00] unto thee. Praise be to God. So saints
[1:27:03] as we close firstly you cannot be
[1:27:07] walking in the vision if you are
[1:27:09] listening to the word that has no divine
[1:27:12] nature in it. If you are listening to
[1:27:14] word that has no image in no image of
[1:27:17] God no uh uh connection to theophony
[1:27:21] you're walking in the wrong vision. You
[1:27:24] cannot have vision if you're walking or
[1:27:27] listening to word that has no divine
[1:27:29] nature in it. You were you were called
[1:27:32] in this day to have dominion over all
[1:27:34] dimensions. You're supposed to have
[1:27:37] dominion restored to you. You shouldn't
[1:27:39] be someone who is let's let's put it
[1:27:42] this way. When you look at people in the
[1:27:45] message today and and to me this is
[1:27:47] something very serious.
[1:27:50] when you look at people in the message
[1:27:51] today and I would ask you all right now
[1:27:54] as we close the service to look at
[1:27:56] yourself and to ask yourself apart from
[1:27:59] how you dress and what you don't do and
[1:28:02] what you don't do and what you don't do
[1:28:03] and what you don't do how are you
[1:28:05] different to a denominational Christian
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; is it just because you believe the
[1:28:11] prophet of the hour
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; they sing songs they use Jesus name they
[1:28:17] worship Christ just like we worship
[1:28:20] in in church. They listen to the word.
[1:28:24] They read their Bibles. They pray. They
[1:28:27] probably pray longer than us and harder
[1:28:29] than us and more fervently than us. They
[1:28:32] fast and pray. So what what about you is
[1:28:35] different?
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Is is the difference just the way you
[1:28:39] dress? Just the way you you don't do
[1:28:42] this, you don't do that? Is it just the
[1:28:44] rules? Because then there are other
[1:28:46] groups of Christians who have rules like
[1:28:48] us and worse than us
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; or better than us, whichever way you
[1:28:53] want to look at it. What makes you
[1:28:55] different?
[1:28:57] And and what makes us different to them?
[1:29:00] Are you different?
[1:29:05] Christians today
[1:29:07] believe that God is there to heal them
[1:29:09] when they're sick,
[1:29:11] give them solutions to their problems.
[1:29:13] And I see this in message people too.
[1:29:15] It's an absolute tragedy.
[1:29:18] This is the truth. If you are if you're
[1:29:20] receiving the image of God and the
[1:29:23] likeness is being restored in this day,
[1:29:25] you are supposed to be beyond asking for
[1:29:28] prayer, beyond asking for miracles. You
[1:29:32] should be beyond expecting miracles.
[1:29:35] You should be beyond casting out demons.
[1:29:38] What's so great about casting out
[1:29:40] demons? What's so great about healings
[1:29:42] and miracles?
[1:29:43] You should be beyond that. You shouldn't
[1:29:45] even be expecting a miracle. You should
[1:29:48] be, if you're living in the vision, then
[1:29:51] your direction and purpose is beyond
[1:29:53] these things that the church is pursuing
[1:29:56] and that the church is concerned with.
[1:29:59] You should be like Paul. Even if God
[1:30:01] doesn't heal me, I got a purpose to
[1:30:03] fulfill. I've beseeched the Lord so many
[1:30:05] times to take this away from me. He
[1:30:06] hasn't. Well, maybe for a purpose. Let's
[1:30:09] move on. That's who we ought to be. That
[1:30:12] means we we don't even lose faith if God
[1:30:14] doesn't heal us or doesn't choose to
[1:30:16] heal us at the time
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; or whenever. We should not be people
[1:30:19] hungering after healings, miracles,
[1:30:22] looking to cast out demons, looking to
[1:30:24] baptize thousands of people. We should
[1:30:27] be looking to bring people to perfection
[1:30:29] of the faith.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; You are supposed to be speaking the word
[1:30:34] and believing what you say
[1:30:36] &gt;&gt; with confidence.
[1:30:38] You cannot have dominion if you are
[1:30:40] still listening to the word of a
[1:30:41] previous generation. If you are
[1:30:44] Pentecostal in your worship, Pentecostal
[1:30:46] in your belief, and you are still
[1:30:48] feeling guilty of the blood of Christ,
[1:30:50] unworthy, then you've not been listening
[1:30:52] to the open book.
[1:30:55] Because the open book does not make the
[1:30:57] bride feel unworthy of Christ.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be receiving that nature.
[1:31:02] That was the nature of the church ages
[1:31:04] to tell you you are a terrible sinner.
[1:31:07] you you you wouldn't you would not make
[1:31:09] it to the sixth dimension. You wouldn't
[1:31:10] make it to heaven unless you accepted
[1:31:13] the blood of Christ unless you see
[1:31:15] Christ as your personal savior. That was
[1:31:17] for a church ages.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; That was for those Christians of a long
[1:31:20] time ago. This is a different time where
[1:31:23] the word is descended. This is a time
[1:31:25] where the bride needs to you. How do you
[1:31:28] take dominion with a spirit of
[1:31:31] unworthiness and guilt and shame?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; You see that? You see that the image of
[1:31:37] God being restored to you should make
[1:31:39] the the church the message to today rise
[1:31:42] above that old Pentecostalism and that
[1:31:45] that nature that the denomination speak
[1:31:48] today. We should be beyond that. If you
[1:31:51] are to be restored to the full image and
[1:31:53] likeness of God, where is the place for
[1:31:56] such mental attitudes?
[1:31:59] Dominion is not dominion is not about
[1:32:02] taking over the world, taking over uh
[1:32:05] governments and trying to prove to them
[1:32:07] that we are right. Make dominion is not
[1:32:10] showing the denominations how great a
[1:32:12] church we are or how better we are
[1:32:14] explaining the word. That's not
[1:32:16] dominion. The dominion we need is the
[1:32:18] dominion over the flesh. Is the dominion
[1:32:21] over the f the fifth dimension. Is the
[1:32:24] dominion over the world that surrounds
[1:32:26] us. It is the dominion over unbelief.
[1:32:29] Amen. Dominion is what the vision must
[1:32:33] produce in us. If you're saying you're
[1:32:35] walking in the vision, you're saying you
[1:32:38] are receiving dominion over all things.
[1:32:41] You're being restored back to Genesis
[1:32:42] 126:27 where all things are placed under
[1:32:46] your subjection.
[1:32:47] You can only achieve that if you the
[1:32:50] feminine attribute of the logos has come
[1:32:53] back in harmony with the masculine uh
[1:32:56] attribute of the logos. So in the last
[1:32:59] session that we will do on Saturday we
[1:33:02] will speak about how the image and the
[1:33:04] likeness of God is restored and how the
[1:33:07] vision of it becomes clearer to us. So I
[1:33:10] trust that you will take saints as we
[1:33:12] close we're going to bow our heads to
[1:33:14] pray and I will hand over to the
[1:33:16] brothers whoever it is that will be
[1:33:18] taking over.
[1:33:20] Let's consider that. Let's bow our heads
[1:33:21] together. Let's think about this
[1:33:24] carefully. Let's consider the most
[1:33:27] important thing here in that I said in
[1:33:30] the last few minutes is that you are you
[1:33:32] are not supposed to be a church like any
[1:33:36] other church. You are supposed to be a
[1:33:38] people who have come to the image of
[1:33:42] God, who have had the who know the image
[1:33:45] has returned, who are in touch with the
[1:33:48] image and who are bringing the likeness.
[1:33:51] Your duty in this day is to restore the
[1:33:55] likeness because the woman broke the
[1:33:58] likeness. The woman today must restore
[1:34:01] the likeness. That is your duty as being
[1:34:04] part of him. That is your vision. And
[1:34:06] that is the vision you must be walking
[1:34:08] in. Let's bow our heads as we pray.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Dear heavenly father,
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; we humbly bow before you in the glorious
[1:34:17] and precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:34:19] Jesus Christ. We're so thankful Lord for
[1:34:22] this wonderful word that you have sent
[1:34:25] our way by the prophet messenger of
[1:34:28] these last days and the voice that still
[1:34:30] rings out every time we listen to it.
[1:34:33] And we even more thankful for he that
[1:34:37] has descended in our day to bring the
[1:34:40] open book to us to reveal these great
[1:34:43] mysteries to us. Dear Lord, who would we
[1:34:47] be but floundering husbands and wives
[1:34:50] just like all those on the outside just
[1:34:53] depressed husbands coming home from work
[1:34:57] just waiting to take a drink. wives
[1:34:59] frustrated with children uh waiting to
[1:35:02] just fight with their husbands, children
[1:35:06] rebellious uh not wanting to uh conform
[1:35:10] to the word of this day. We we would
[1:35:13] just be that kind of unhappy life that
[1:35:17] is going around in this world and in the
[1:35:20] world today thinking and believing that
[1:35:22] money can solve their problems and if
[1:35:24] they work harder and they get more money
[1:35:26] then they will be more happy or happier
[1:35:29] and it's such an illusion. Though they
[1:35:31] be celebrities, though they be
[1:35:33] government officials, they lose their
[1:35:35] lives just the same as the common man.
[1:35:37] They lose their happiness just the same
[1:35:39] as the common man. There's nothing they
[1:35:41] achieve that they are satisfied with.
[1:35:43] They just want more and more and more.
[1:35:46] And yet we have received everything.
[1:35:50] All that we desire is what you have
[1:35:52] given to us.
[1:35:54] This should be more than a fantasy. This
[1:35:56] should be more than a theory. It should
[1:35:59] be more than a religion to your people
[1:36:02] in this day. Father, I pray that you may
[1:36:05] impress this upon us as we bow our heads
[1:36:08] to you. Those who are in need of you
[1:36:12] today. Those who have have a deeper
[1:36:14] desire to know more about your divine
[1:36:16] nature.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Those who have neglected to search the
[1:36:20] word. Those who have been complacent in
[1:36:24] having such a great message with us and
[1:36:26] not taking the great advantage Lord of
[1:36:28] of following what the word says and
[1:36:31] studying it and falling in love with it.
[1:36:34] May they reconsecrate their lives to you
[1:36:37] today. Father, we pray for all those
[1:36:40] around the world here on this forum uh
[1:36:45] and those of the local churches. Lord,
[1:36:47] we pray that you would forgive us of our
[1:36:50] complacency, forgive us of where we
[1:36:51] failed you, Lord, as we bring this to
[1:36:54] our hearts tonight, Lord, to provoke us,
[1:36:57] to provoke our understanding, to provoke
[1:36:59] our faith. I pray dear Lord that you may
[1:37:01] bless us now as you promised in this
[1:37:04] word. If we at this condition after
[1:37:06] having corrupted ourselves, if we will
[1:37:08] turn our hearts to you again, you will
[1:37:11] not forsake us.
[1:37:13] You will restore us. And I believe that
[1:37:15] you have already started the great plan
[1:37:16] of redemption 2,000 years ago and you
[1:37:20] are completing it in this day. And we
[1:37:22] are so thankful that the vision has been
[1:37:24] made clear to us today. We ask it now,
[1:37:27] Lord, in the precious and holy name of
[1:37:28] our Lord and Savior, the Lord Jesus
[1:37:30] Christ, with much praise and
[1:37:32] thanksgiving. Amen. And amen.
[1:37:36] The Lord bless you, saints. It's been a
[1:37:38] wonderful privilege to be speaking to
[1:37:39] you today. And with that, I'd like to
[1:37:41] hand over to our brothers, um, whoever
[1:37:44] would be taking over. God bless you.
[1:37:46] Amen.
