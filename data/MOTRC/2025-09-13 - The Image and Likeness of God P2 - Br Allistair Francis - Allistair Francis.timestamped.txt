[0:02] Greetings, brothers and sisters, in the
[0:03] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[0:05] Jesus Christ. We're happy to be with you
[0:07] once again. Once again, thank you for
[0:09] the great privilege that it is to share
[0:12] the word of the Lord with you and thank
[0:14] you to all the brothers from the
[0:16] Philippines and to all you people around
[0:19] the world that are uh listening to these
[0:21] messages and we appreciate you all.
[0:25] Thank you uh once again for this
[0:27] opportunity. So, let's just bow our
[0:30] heads as we pray. Dear Lord Jesus, we
[0:33] approach your throne room of grace once
[0:35] again. We're so thankful, Lord, for this
[0:37] time that we could share the word of the
[0:39] Lord with your people. We thankful for
[0:42] your grace and your mercy, for watching
[0:44] over us, for for caring for us, Lord,
[0:46] during these times of difficulty in the
[0:49] world. We ask you now for your presence
[0:51] with us as we open up your word and get
[0:54] into these wonderful mystery truths that
[0:56] you have revealed to us. We are so
[0:58] thankful, Father, for these things. And
[1:00] we give you all the praise and the glory
[1:02] and the honor. We thank you for the
[1:03] meetings thus far and that have blessed
[1:05] our souls. And we pray now, Lord, that
[1:07] as we would read the word that you would
[1:10] break it out to us, Lord, and uh feed
[1:13] us, Lord, from your divine holy throne.
[1:15] Father, we pray that you may bless the
[1:17] service now in Jesus precious name with
[1:20] much praise and thanksgiving. Amen.
[1:22] Amen. So without much ado, we want to
[1:25] get into um the same subject. Uh so the
[1:29] theme like we said was walking in the
[1:31] vision and we're dealing with the image
[1:33] and the likeness of God. So we want to
[1:38] like I said in the last uh uh service
[1:40] that we want to speak on restoring the
[1:44] image and the likeness of God. Having
[1:45] seen how it was lost, we are now going
[1:48] to get into how it is restored. So we
[1:52] want to show that the image that is
[1:55] restored is through Christ that is in
[1:58] the first coming and the likeness is
[2:00] restored through the bride that is in
[2:02] the second coming. So let's open up our
[2:05] Bibles or you can follow on the screens
[2:07] in Genesis 3 and verse 22 to verse 24.
[2:13] And the Lord God said, "Behold, the man
[2:15] is become as one of us to know good and
[2:18] evil, and now, lest he put forth his
[2:20] hand, and take also of the tree of life,
[2:23] and eat and live forever."
[2:28] Therefore the Lord God sent him forth
[2:30] from the garden of Eden to till the
[2:32] ground from whence he was taken. So he
[2:34] drove out the man and he placed at the
[2:36] east of the garden of Eden cherubams and
[2:39] a flaming sword which turned every way
[2:42] to keep the way of the tree of life.
[2:45] Amen. So just to revise in Genesis
[2:48] 1:26-27,
[2:50] God created man. That was created man.
[2:53] He was a spirit in the image of God and
[2:56] in the likeness. Remember that. Uh point
[2:59] number two, Genesis 2:18. When the woman
[3:02] was formed, man was now in the image of
[3:05] God and after the likeness. Why? Because
[3:08] they were two separate bodies and they
[3:11] were asked to be uh united in uh or
[3:14] rather become in harmony or one in
[3:17] flesh. Number three, the harmony between
[3:20] male and female perfectly resembled and
[3:24] reflected the father and the son.
[3:27] Subjection but equality.
[3:32] When Adam was alone, point number four,
[3:34] Genesis 2:7, he manifested more
[3:37] maleness, though he was male and female.
[3:41] When you looked at him, you could see
[3:43] the maleness of him. He looked male and
[3:46] the female part was a hidden mystery
[3:48] within him. Uh that's because that
[3:51] attribute was in perfect harmony and in
[3:54] subjection to him. In Genesis 21:18,
[3:57] point number five, the masculine and
[3:59] feminine natures of Adam's spirit were
[4:02] separated, but they were one flesh. She
[4:06] was born of his bone, flesh of his
[4:07] flesh. They were one in spirit only by a
[4:11] marriage union.
[4:13] Uh, point number six, it took death to
[4:15] separate the feminine from the
[4:17] masculine. Adam had to die for the woman
[4:21] to be formed. Remember the prophet said
[4:24] that in rising of the sun, God had to
[4:26] put Adam to sleep then take out that uh
[4:29] DNA from his side uh and and create or
[4:33] form the woman the the woman's body. So
[4:36] it took death to separate the feminine
[4:39] from the masculine. Amen. I know you can
[4:42] see the types already. Uh point number
[4:44] seven, sin broke the union of the
[4:48] spirit.
[4:49] Right? The woman's union with the
[4:52] serpent marred the union with her
[4:55] husband and that's what lost them
[4:58] dominion.
[4:59] Amen. Uh Adam's desire to follow his
[5:02] wife made them lose the nature of
[5:05] created man which means they lost the
[5:08] image of God. So what we're seeing is
[5:11] the woman caused the likeness to be
[5:13] marred and caused dominion to be gone
[5:17] and man the man uh uh lost the image
[5:21] lost the theophony when he chose to go
[5:24] the way that his wife had showed him and
[5:26] to disregard the will of God and that's
[5:29] when the image of God was lost. All
[5:31] right. So in Deuteronomy 4, this is
[5:33] point number eight. God's way to restore
[5:36] that image was by hearing his voice that
[5:40] is the word. Amen.
[5:43] So let's begin. This is where we last
[5:46] ended with those points just to revise.
[5:48] Through all this we realized that
[5:51] theophony can only be restored to man by
[5:53] hearing the voice of God. The criterion
[5:56] was always and has always been, he that
[5:59] hath an ear, let him hear what the
[6:01] spirit says. We can we can see that he
[6:03] says this throughout the church ages,
[6:05] right? He that hath an ear, let him hear
[6:07] what the spirit says.
[6:10] So God's first man failed and threw
[6:14] everything into chaos. Is that right? It
[6:17] had to take more than man to redeem
[6:20] mankind and take him back to his
[6:22] original status. Praise be to God. God
[6:26] saw in his mind that it had to take two
[6:29] comingings of the word to redeem man
[6:32] back to what was lost. Each coming had
[6:36] its own unique purpose. If we see what
[6:39] those purposes are, then we really see
[6:42] what it means to be living in the
[6:44] vision.
[6:46] Amen. So, let's get to the second Adam.
[6:49] Let's talk about the second Adam and and
[6:52] then take it from there and go through
[6:54] to the first coming. Now we know that
[6:56] Christ is called the second Adam. Can
[6:58] you see how this opens up a new
[7:00] dimension of thought that when you
[7:02] consider that the likeness or the image
[7:05] and the likeness of God was lost under
[7:07] the first Adam and now there is a second
[7:10] Adam. What are we saying? Why would he
[7:12] be called the second Adam? That's
[7:15] because the first Adam had lost
[7:18] everything. Now you you actually know
[7:19] this from Romans 5 because where the
[7:22] first Adam and lost everything, the
[7:24] second Adam must restore everything.
[7:26] That's the reason he is called the
[7:28] second Adam. Well, one of them. So there
[7:31] are several absolutely important reasons
[7:34] why Christ is called the second Adam.
[7:36] But we're just going to talk about one.
[7:38] One is because he's the only other man
[7:41] that came into the world by the same
[7:44] order as Adam.
[7:46] How so? Well, Adam was theophony first.
[7:50] He's the only man other than Christ.
[7:52] Every other man in this world is born by
[7:54] a woman and conceived through sexuality.
[7:57] Adam was theophony. In other words, he
[7:59] came from the logos from thought form.
[8:02] He became word. He was given a word body
[8:05] and then from word to flesh. Now, you
[8:07] know who is this? MelkiseDC. Brother
[8:09] said we came straight from thought form.
[8:12] We bypassed theophony and came into
[8:15] sinful flesh. Therefore, the whole plan
[8:18] is we must get back to theophony and
[8:20] then come back to glorified flesh for
[8:22] the millennium. Now, uh Adam, now watch
[8:26] this. The the the reason why the first
[8:29] Adam and second Adam are well, one of
[8:31] the reasons why Christ is called the
[8:33] second Adam. I mean really uh Adam
[8:36] should be called I mean if you if you
[8:39] make it in terms of importance, Christ
[8:41] of course is far more important than
[8:43] Adam. uh and and yet Christ is being
[8:45] called uh a term by a man who had
[8:49] fallen. It doesn't sound really right.
[8:52] But I mean Christ is called a son of
[8:54] David and so on. But so it's not about
[8:56] that. It's not about the importance.
[8:59] It's about how these men were prefigures
[9:02] of Christ that was to come. So Christ
[9:05] the second Adam, right? That's what
[9:06] we're speaking about. So Adam came from
[9:09] thought form. God saying let us make man
[9:12] from thought form. He came into word
[9:14] form which was theophony and then that
[9:17] was Genesis 1:26-27 and then from
[9:20] theophony Genesis 2:7 which was formed
[9:24] man flesh man so uh Christ now was first
[9:29] theophony John 1:1 in the beginning was
[9:32] the word so Christ of course was
[9:34] theophony long before Adam was theophony
[9:37] amen so John 1:1 Christ was theophony in
[9:40] the beginning was the word the word was
[9:42] with God. And then the second Adam was
[9:46] Theophony before the foundation of the
[9:48] world. Obviously, he was the logos. God
[9:51] forming himself into a celestial body
[9:54] that we identify as the word. It is a
[9:58] literal body of a dimension that we
[10:01] cannot see
[10:02] &gt;&gt; or touch being limited by dimensions of
[10:05] light, matter, and time. See, because we
[10:07] live in this world of light, matter and
[10:09] time, our our beings cannot uh perceive
[10:13] or cannot see or cannot touch another
[10:16] literal dimension called the seventh
[10:18] dimension or the sixth dimension. We
[10:20] cannot see it. We cannot uh uh absorb um
[10:25] anything through these senses by that
[10:27] unless he begins to reveal himself by
[10:30] it. So we are limited from seeing it,
[10:33] from touching it because we are limited
[10:35] by the three dimensions of light, matter
[10:37] and time. So notice for God to form
[10:40] himself into flesh to become the second
[10:43] Adam, he didn't have to say let us make
[10:46] man again. He didn't have to say let us
[10:50] make man because Christ was already
[10:52] theophony, right? He was the word. The
[10:55] logos was God himself being formed right
[10:59] into theophony. Now this theophony,
[11:03] he the logos was God himself now
[11:06] becoming formed man. Amen. That's what
[11:10] he's doing. So God was not creating
[11:13] another man here. He was forming
[11:16] Theophony, King Theophony into human
[11:19] flesh. But the mystery was this time
[11:23] through the womb of a woman and not from
[11:26] the dust of the ground like the first
[11:28] Adam was. Now let's be let's let's read
[11:31] John 1:1. In the beginning was the word
[11:34] and the word was with God and the word
[11:36] was God. Right? And Colossians 2:9 says,
[11:40] "For in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[11:44] the Godhead bodily." Amen. Bodily. which
[11:49] means in that formed man. Now remember
[11:51] why are we using these these phrases
[11:53] because brother Madam said there is a
[11:55] difference between created man and
[11:57] formed man. He said created man was Adam
[12:00] in theophony formed man was Adam in
[12:04] flesh in the garden of Eden. So here now
[12:07] we have Christ born of a woman that's
[12:10] formed man and that formed man held
[12:14] within him the fullness of the godhead.
[12:17] Amen.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Incredible. Amen. So, in other words,
[12:21] God himself became formed man
[12:25] &gt;&gt; in the Lord Jesus Christ. Let's go to
[12:27] John 1:14.
[12:29] And the word was made flesh and dwelt
[12:33] among us. And we beheld his glory. Can
[12:36] you see that? So by him coming becoming
[12:38] the word made flesh, we beheld. That
[12:42] means now because we are limited by
[12:44] light matter time, he became light
[12:46] matter time. So we could behold his
[12:49] glory. What does that mean? That we
[12:51] could see the image of God. Glory to
[12:54] God. The glory as of the only begotten
[12:58] of the father full of grace and truth.
[13:01] Had he not done that, we would not be
[13:03] able to see the image of God, hear the
[13:06] image of God, feel, touch um everything
[13:10] to to absorb the image of God. Now being
[13:14] in fallen flesh through Christ through
[13:16] the first coming, we can start to see
[13:18] the image of God being restored to
[13:20] mankind, coming back, coming closer. So
[13:24] Adam was born of the logos, but Christ
[13:26] the logos was begotten of the father.
[13:30] Amen. That's the difference between
[13:32] these two who became flesh. That's the
[13:34] difference between the first Adam and
[13:36] the second Adam. Now, Adam was born of
[13:39] the word, but Christ was born of the
[13:42] spirit.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as Genesis 1:26-27,
[13:47] of course, we know when we say Christ
[13:49] being born of the spirit means he was he
[13:52] came from the father. He he was the
[13:54] logos that were out of the fountain of
[13:57] life. Whereas Adam's theophony came out
[14:00] of King Theophony who was the word, born
[14:02] of the word, Christ born of the spirit.
[14:05] Now, as Genesis 1:26-27
[14:08] gives the origin of the first Adam, John
[14:11] 1:1 gives the origin of the second Adam.
[14:14] Amen. So, what was the image of the
[14:18] second Adam? That's what we want to see.
[14:20] What was the image of the second Adam?
[14:22] It was God. It was deity. It was King
[14:25] Theophony. That was his image. the
[14:27] fountain of life, Elohim,
[14:30] the very image of God. And we have
[14:32] scriptures to back that up. Let's read
[14:35] them. 2 Corinthians 4 and verse4, if
[14:38] you're following on the screen, in whom
[14:40] the God of this world hath blinded the
[14:42] minds of them who believe not, lest the
[14:45] light of the glorious gospel of Christ,
[14:48] Christ who is the image of God. Now, now
[14:54] we know that the man who was standing
[14:57] there 2,000 years ago, his shape and
[15:00] form had nothing to do with the image of
[15:02] God. How how do we know this? Because
[15:04] when the Pharisees spoke to him, they
[15:05] said to him, you know, you you don't
[15:08] look more than 50 years old. How could
[15:11] you say you knew Abraham, Moses, and so
[15:13] on? Which means they were looking at a
[15:15] form which clearly was a man, the form
[15:18] of a man. It was not the image of God.
[15:20] that that uh uh uh person that was
[15:23] standing there in flesh that flesh
[15:25] person was not the image of God. But
[15:28] here the scripture is saying Christ who
[15:30] is the image of God. So speaking of his
[15:34] nature, his character, the image of God
[15:37] was the person inside
[15:40] &gt;&gt; that was veiled by the flesh. Amen. So
[15:43] who is the image of God should shine
[15:45] unto them. If you read Colossians 1
[15:47] and:15, it says, "Who is the image of
[15:51] the invisible God?" Glory to God. I like
[15:54] that scripture because an invisible God
[15:57] has no image, no physical or image in a
[16:02] worldly sense. Has no form, has no uh uh
[16:05] shape, uh and invisible, a spirit, uh
[16:09] the the fountain of life. He has no form
[16:12] that people uh can draw or and to the
[16:16] discredit all the painters and artists
[16:19] of the world who keep trying to draw the
[16:22] father, they're doing the human race a
[16:24] great discredit by planting false images
[16:27] in their mind and causing them to serve
[16:29] God as an idol. It should never be done.
[16:32] So God is not some old white man with a
[16:34] beard giant size sitting on a throne in
[16:37] the universe somewhere and then the son
[16:39] a small little second person nearby on a
[16:42] lesser throne. That's carnality. That is
[16:45] a figment of people's imagination. That
[16:47] is not at all what the scriptures teach
[16:49] us. And if you are seeing the open book
[16:51] today, you should never be even praying
[16:53] with your eyes shut dreaming about that
[16:56] kind of God and his son in heaven. That
[16:59] is absolute Catholic doctrine. It is
[17:01] absolutely false. Catholic and all other
[17:04] denominations absolutely false. If you
[17:06] are starting to live in this vision, you
[17:08] know God is a spirit and they that
[17:10] worship him must worship him in spirit
[17:12] and in truth. Let's read Hebrews chapter
[17:15] 1 verse 1-3.
[17:17] God who atre times and in diverse
[17:19] manners spake in time in times past unto
[17:22] the fathers by the prophets hath in
[17:25] these last days spoken unto us spoken
[17:29] unto us. Amen. What's that voice
[17:33] spoken unto us by his son whom he hath
[17:37] appointed heir of all things by whom he
[17:39] also made by whom also he made the
[17:42] worlds. That's again telling us that the
[17:44] son the word made the worlds. He was the
[17:46] creator. Think of that not even the
[17:49] spirit form of God did the creation. God
[17:52] had to become something visible and that
[17:55] visible person made everything that is.
[18:00] Glory to God. Who being verse three who
[18:03] being the brightness of his glory that
[18:06] is the expression of his nature and it
[18:09] it says the express image of his person.
[18:13] The expressed image the manifested image
[18:17] of his person. In other words, the
[18:18] spirit, the divine nature, the
[18:21] attributes of God were all made known,
[18:24] made visible through the word, through
[18:27] the son, the express image of his
[18:30] person. So, who was the image of um the
[18:34] second Adam? It was God himself,
[18:37] &gt;&gt; right? Adam's image, Genesis 2:7, Adam
[18:41] had the image of the word which came
[18:42] from the logos and which we all have a
[18:44] piece of. But this second Adam was the
[18:48] express image of the person of God
[18:50] himself. There's the difference between
[18:52] the first Adam and the second Adam. Why?
[18:55] You can see that this second Adam is
[18:57] worthy to bring back the image of God to
[19:00] mankind. Notice the father created the
[19:03] worlds by the son. The word the son was
[19:07] the express image of the person of the
[19:09] father. What is image referring to here?
[19:13] the spirit in Christ, not the flesh. The
[19:17] spirit, God is a spirit, not flesh.
[19:20] Amen. So John 3:6 says, "That which is
[19:24] born of the flesh is flesh, and that
[19:28] which is born of the spirit is spirit."
[19:31] Glory to God. That which is born of the
[19:34] flesh is flesh. That which is born of
[19:35] the spirit is spirit. So we are born of
[19:39] the flesh only. That is why we now you
[19:43] know the word born means actually means
[19:47] you know when we think about being born
[19:48] we think of a baby being delivered from
[19:51] his mother's womb and we think about
[19:53] coming into this flesh and so on but
[19:55] born is a word that actually refle
[19:58] reflects origin where you come from. So
[20:02] born of a material where you come from
[20:05] where your origins are. So it's more
[20:07] like if you if you were born of the
[20:10] spirit then that's who you are. You are
[20:13] that spirit. If you're born of the flesh
[20:15] then you are of the flesh. So if you are
[20:18] born of the spirit it means that's the
[20:21] nature and the character that you
[20:22] actually have because that which is born
[20:25] of the spirit is spirit. Amen. So we
[20:31] were born of the flesh only and that is
[20:33] the reason we needed to be born again of
[20:35] the spirit. That's the whole reason for
[20:38] the Christian principle of being born
[20:40] again so that we can start to see the
[20:42] word. Now, so if you come to the new
[20:45] birth, like our brother was saying uh
[20:47] the other day, if you are born of the
[20:49] spirit, uh if you are born again, that
[20:52] new birth, what does it do for you?
[20:56] Amen. This is what's beautiful about it.
[20:58] A lot of people don't realize what the
[21:00] new birth does. You know the prophet
[21:02] says the new birth I think it's in
[21:04] Christ the mystery of God revealed. He
[21:06] says the new birth is Christ revealed to
[21:08] you personally. Now a lot of people
[21:10] don't realize what the new birth is.
[21:12] They think it's you know coming to live
[21:14] a new life and and uh being converted to
[21:16] Christianity and living clean and holy
[21:20] and so on. Here's the reality of the new
[21:22] birth. If you are born of the spirit, if
[21:25] you are reborn
[21:28] um the new birth of the spirit, it adds
[21:31] a dimension to your dimensions. So you
[21:35] are light, matter, and time. But when
[21:37] you are born of the spirit, now you
[21:39] start to see the word because prior to
[21:42] that, you couldn't see the word. You'd
[21:43] read the message, you'd read the Bible,
[21:45] and you wouldn't see a thing. It'd be
[21:47] like looking at a piece of plywood. Uh
[21:49] you wouldn't understand anything. You'd
[21:51] you'd misinterpret anything. You'd
[21:54] become a dictator of uh countries
[21:56] believing in the Bible. Um you'd kill
[21:59] thousands of people thinking you're
[22:00] doing something right. It's because
[22:02] you're still reading the holy scriptures
[22:04] by late metitime dimensions. But when
[22:07] you receive the new birth, it adds
[22:09] another dimension to you. It literally
[22:12] adds another dimension to you. That's
[22:14] what it does. And that's what we really
[22:16] mean by being born again. So when you
[22:19] add that other dimension, praise be to
[22:22] God, you are no longer limited by light,
[22:24] matter, and time. When you were born
[22:26] again of the open book, Christ revealed
[22:29] to you personally, it adds a dimension
[22:32] that now makes you see the word where
[22:34] previously you wouldn't have been able
[22:36] to see the word. Glory to God. Psalm
[22:39] 51:5 says, "Behold, I was shapen in
[22:42] iniquity, and in sin did my mother
[22:45] conceive me." So even the body of Christ
[22:48] was conceived because Mary's body was
[22:51] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost. So we
[22:54] were conceived in sin. He was not
[22:57] conceived in sin. He was conceived of
[23:00] the Holy Ghost. You can read that
[23:01] Matthew 1:18. You all know this. Now the
[23:04] birth of Christ was on this wise when as
[23:06] his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[23:09] before they came together, she was found
[23:12] with child of the Holy Ghost. Amen. So
[23:15] when the second Adam was formed, his
[23:19] body was subject to aging but sin was
[23:22] subject to him. If you look at how we
[23:25] are, our our bodies were subject to sin,
[23:29] right? Subject to aging, subject to sin.
[23:31] But here sin was subject to him with the
[23:36] second Adam. He had dominion over sin,
[23:39] over the body of the flesh. He was above
[23:42] everything that concerns man. The Bible
[23:44] says he was tested on every point of
[23:46] man.
[23:48] Even death was subjected to him. Death
[23:52] was in subjection to him because death
[23:54] couldn't hold him down. Glory to God.
[23:56] Look at the first Adam. Let's compare
[23:58] them. Animals were brought to him to see
[24:00] what he would call them. Call them
[24:02] doesn't mean Adam stood there saying you
[24:05] are lion, you are elephant, you are
[24:08] deer, you are this, you are that. No, he
[24:10] wasn't naming them names as in giving
[24:13] those names like lion only came years
[24:15] later when Latin came in and English
[24:17] came in. Uh that wasn't what Adam called
[24:20] them. So Adam calling them by name means
[24:23] he was placing them in their order for
[24:26] the earth to function properly. In other
[24:29] words, the names he was calling them was
[24:32] uh giving them their characters like you
[24:35] shall be this kind of eater. You will
[24:37] eat this much. You will you will eat
[24:39] this much of this kind of vegetation.
[24:41] You will eat that much of that kind of
[24:42] vegetation. You will bring forth
[24:44] children in 2 years. You will bring
[24:46] forth children every month. He that was
[24:48] what the name he was giving them. Now
[24:50] this is important to understand. A lot
[24:52] of people thought he just called them
[24:53] lion, cat, dog, this, that. That's
[24:56] wrong. The name of something is the
[24:58] character of something is uh is the
[25:01] reputation of something. It's it's uh um
[25:04] the entire uh nature that the the thing
[25:08] should have. So he was looking at the
[25:10] animal and literally putting into them
[25:12] he was the god of the world. He was the
[25:14] god of the earth at the time. He was
[25:16] telling them this is how in other words
[25:18] if he didn't do that imagine if you had
[25:20] elephants having babies every 9 months
[25:23] like humans. I mean those fellas will
[25:26] eat the whole planet's vegetation. They
[25:28] have to have children after 2 years. And
[25:30] that was designed. That's why he called
[25:32] them. It's important to know that,
[25:35] right? So he identified them and he
[25:38] called them by name. Whereas the second
[25:41] Adam had people brought to him. He
[25:45] identified them. He discerned their
[25:46] hearts
[25:48] &gt;&gt; and he called them by name. even
[25:50] discerning the very intent of their
[25:52] hearts to be able to place them in the
[25:55] kingdom. Right? So he was placing them
[25:57] in a spiritual kingdom where Adam was
[25:59] placing animals in creation in a natural
[26:02] kingdom. That's the difference between
[26:04] the first Adam and second Adam. So you
[26:06] can see the one was very much pertaining
[26:08] to the flesh and the second Adam was
[26:10] very much pertaining to the kingdom of
[26:12] God.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Now at that point the second Adam the
[26:17] bride was still in him. Amen. You can
[26:20] find in COD page 1108, brother Brandon
[26:22] actually says that Jesus had both male
[26:25] and female in him. Now you know the all
[26:27] the other quotes how that he says uh you
[26:30] were in him when he went to the cross.
[26:32] You have another one where he says
[26:34] someday you'll find out that you died
[26:36] for your own sins because you died in
[26:38] him. you were resurrected in him or or
[26:40] rather uh um he says at the cross when
[26:44] water blood and spirit uh poured out it
[26:47] was the birth of the church and that was
[26:48] the point that we're speaking about
[26:50] right so he had in him Christ had in him
[26:53] male and female you know I think there's
[26:55] another place where they asked uh the
[26:58] prophet a question about why did Christ
[27:00] have long hair and of course I'm not
[27:02] going to get into that but a kind of
[27:04] answer he gave them was that well he
[27:06] still had the bride in him he still had
[27:08] the church in him. Glory to God. So he
[27:11] had the harmony of both the attributes.
[27:14] Christ now just like Adam in Genesis
[27:17] 2:7, Adam had both male and female
[27:20] inside him. So did Christ have both male
[27:22] and female inside him. He had the
[27:25] harmony of both the attributes. So the
[27:28] likeness of God in perfection, the
[27:31] dominion. Therefore, even the tempter
[27:33] could come to him and tell him whatever
[27:35] and he would say, "Get thee behind me,
[27:37] Satan." Uh, he had perfect dominion over
[27:40] all dimensions. When he came to the
[27:41] maniac of Gdara, he stood on the shore
[27:44] and the uh this man full of demons
[27:48] rammed him. And the demons said, "The
[27:50] demons identified him. Excuse me. They
[27:53] knew who he was. Why you come to torment
[27:56] us before our time?" as if those demons
[27:58] actually knew or those devils rather
[28:00] knew uh um when their time was and uh so
[28:04] they said to him why are you here to
[28:06] torment us before our time. Right? So
[28:09] when this um or this harmony of having
[28:13] both attributes produced uh dominion
[28:16] over all dimensions. Amen.
[28:20] Now uh just like the first Adam had
[28:22] before the woman was taken out of him.
[28:25] Now we find this harmony between father
[28:27] and son. Let's read John 5:19-26.
[28:31] So this harmony between the spirit and
[28:34] the word. Now a good exercise for you uh
[28:37] when you read your Bible, I would
[28:39] encourage you to look away from that
[28:41] trinitarian sort of uh um understanding
[28:45] of the scriptures. You should rather do
[28:48] this. When you read the scriptures and
[28:50] when you read like John 5:19 and you say
[28:54] and you read wherever you see the word
[28:56] son, slot in the word. Wherever you see
[29:00] the word father, slot in the spirit. And
[29:03] then you start to see a whole new
[29:04] picture. It says, "Then Jesus answered
[29:07] and said unto them, verily, verily, I
[29:10] say unto you, the son can do nothing of
[29:13] himself, but what he seeth the father
[29:15] do." So you can you can take that and
[29:17] slot it in. The word can do nothing of
[29:20] itself, but what he seeth the spirit do.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; For what things soever he doeth, these
[29:27] also doeth the son likewise. So I'm not
[29:30] going to do that now, but you can do
[29:32] that and you see something completely
[29:34] different to a sort of trinity godhead
[29:36] kind of thing. You start to understand
[29:38] more of the nature of God. So watch the
[29:41] harmony. What what the scripture is
[29:43] basically telling us is that the word
[29:46] does not create anything without having
[29:49] being led of the spirit. He doesn't do
[29:51] anything of himself what he seeth the
[29:53] father. That means the word is not like
[29:55] a loose cannon like a wild uh uh um a
[29:59] power that just moves off doing whatever
[30:02] it does without design, without purpose,
[30:04] without direction. The direction of the
[30:06] word is the spirit in the word. That's
[30:09] what the scripture is telling us. For
[30:12] the father loveth the son. That doesn't
[30:14] mean the big old old white man with the
[30:17] beard father says, "Oh Jesus, I really
[30:20] love you." You know, that kind of
[30:22] trinitarian nonsense. The father loveth
[30:25] the son. What does it mean? Love. Love
[30:27] is is an English word we use. But what
[30:30] does this really mean? What does love
[30:31] really mean? The father loveth the son.
[30:34] It's a it's a a far bigger revelation
[30:37] than just loving someone. as in hugs and
[30:40] kisses and embraces and kind words.
[30:44] That's not the the the the relationship
[30:46] between father and son. People of God,
[30:48] we really need to open our eyes to this
[30:50] dimension and see what it really means.
[30:52] The father loveth the son. It means they
[30:55] are in union. They cannot be apart.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; They cannot be torn apart.
[31:01] It means these two attributes uh uh work
[31:04] together, exist together, loveth the
[31:08] son. They exist together and showed him
[31:12] all things that he himself doeth and he
[31:14] will show him greater works than these
[31:16] that you might marvel. Verse 21, for as
[31:19] the father raisth up the dead and
[31:22] quickenth them, even so the son
[31:24] quickenth whom he will. That's telling
[31:27] us that the word is able to be directed
[31:29] and see what is going on and he can
[31:32] quicken things to life. For the father
[31:35] judgeth no man but hath committed all
[31:38] judgment unto the son. So that love that
[31:42] you see between that harmony between
[31:44] father and son uh shows a direction of
[31:48] the spirit to the word. The spirit
[31:50] directs the word. The word when it
[31:53] produces when create is directed by a
[31:55] divine nature. Nothing is wrong. Nothing
[31:58] is in error. Nothing is out of bounds.
[32:01] Verse 23. That all men should honor the
[32:04] word the son even as they honor the
[32:07] father. The spirit or the nature. He
[32:10] that honorth the the son honorth. He
[32:13] that honorth not the son honorth not the
[32:15] father which hath sent him. Verily,
[32:18] verily, I say unto you, he that heareth
[32:20] my word and believeth on me, on him that
[32:23] sent me, hath everlasting life, and
[32:26] shall not come into condemnation, but is
[32:28] passed from death unto life. Verse 25,
[32:32] verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour
[32:34] is coming, and now is when the dead
[32:37] shall hear the voice of the son of God.
[32:39] Amen. The hour is coming, and now is
[32:42] when the dead shall hear the voice of
[32:45] the son of God. What's happening? the
[32:47] dead. Those We're not just talking about
[32:50] those who are dead uh um in the fifth
[32:53] dimension, who are trapped in the fifth
[32:55] dimension. We're talking about those who
[32:57] are walking around unable to see, unable
[33:01] to be acquainted with the great image of
[33:03] God. Now, they're going to hear.
[33:07] Amen. And they that hear shall live.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Verse 26. For as the father hath life,
[33:14] as the divine nature, the spirit, has
[33:17] life in itself, so hath he given to the
[33:20] son to have life in himself. What does
[33:23] that mean? That means the ability to
[33:26] quicken things to life. Glory to God.
[33:29] That is the reason why if the word has
[33:31] the ability to quicken to life. See,
[33:34] we're not just saying Jesus Christ of
[33:36] 2,000 years ago had the ability to
[33:38] quicken things to life. So people must
[33:40] wait for him to come again in a second
[33:42] coming, a literal corporal coming, then
[33:44] he will quicken things to life. No. Who
[33:47] is his person? His person is the word.
[33:50] And wherever the word is heard, it
[33:52] quickens to life.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. As the father, as the
[33:57] divine nature had life in itself, so has
[34:00] the word to uh life in himself to be
[34:02] able to quicken. Let's go to John 10:27
[34:05] to30.
[34:07] My sheep hear my voice and I know them
[34:09] and they follow me and I give unto them
[34:12] eternal life and they shall never perish
[34:14] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[34:17] my hand. My father which gave them me is
[34:20] greater than all and no man is able to
[34:22] pluck them out of my father's hand.
[34:25] Watch this. I and my father are one. The
[34:30] word and the spirit are one. Now you can
[34:33] you can understand why the prophet says
[34:35] not one like your finger. That's because
[34:37] one like your finger is limited by late
[34:40] matter time understanding. Do you see
[34:43] that? But when you see it with the word
[34:45] you are seeing the word and the divine
[34:48] nature are in union. They are they of
[34:52] the same material. They are the same
[34:54] makeup. They are in perfect agreement.
[34:57] They are not two things.
[35:00] Uh they are not two things at all. They
[35:02] are two attributes in perfect harmony
[35:05] making a whole new creation, a whole new
[35:09] thing that is made visible. Amen. I hope
[35:12] you can see that. John 14:5-10. Thomas
[35:16] said unto him, Lord, we know not whether
[35:19] thou goest. That means we don't know
[35:20] where you're going. How can we know the
[35:22] way? So, he's talking about the way to
[35:24] the father. Jesus said unto him, I am
[35:27] the way, the truth, and the life. No man
[35:29] cometh unto the father but by me. What's
[35:31] that saying? No man can receive the
[35:33] divine nature of God. No man can receive
[35:36] the image of God without me, without the
[35:40] word.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; I am the way. I am the way to the
[35:43] father. I am the way to the divine
[35:45] nature. I am the way to theophony. I am
[35:47] the way to your image.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. The image of God.
[35:52] &gt;&gt; If you had known me, if you had known
[35:55] the word, you would know my father also.
[35:58] If you if you have the word revealed to
[36:01] you, you will see the image of God. You
[36:03] will receive the image of God. And from
[36:05] henceforth, you know him and have seen
[36:09] him. Philip said unto him, Lord, show us
[36:11] the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus
[36:14] said unto him, Have I been so long with
[36:16] you, and yet thou hast not known me,
[36:18] Philillip? He that hath seen me hath
[36:20] seen the Father. And how sayest thou
[36:22] then, show us the Father? Believest thou
[36:25] not that I am in the Father, and the
[36:27] Father in me? The words that I speak
[36:30] unto you, I speak not of myself, but the
[36:33] Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[36:35] works. Now, here's something important.
[36:38] Not here in my notes, but just to tell
[36:40] you, a lot of people look at this. This
[36:43] is one of the most pivotal point of all
[36:45] scripture. I am in the father and the
[36:48] father in me. It's important because
[36:49] this leads to John 14:20 which says uh
[36:52] at that day you shall know I am in the
[36:54] father and I in you and you in me and so
[36:57] on. But this is what's important. Any
[36:59] person can understand the father in
[37:02] Christ, right? I am in the uh uh and the
[37:05] the father in me because when Christ
[37:07] stood there everybody understands it was
[37:09] God in Christ but he says I am in the
[37:13] father. So for example, if if you look
[37:16] at anything in life, for example, a
[37:18] glass of water and you take water and
[37:21] pour it into into a glass, you
[37:24] understand the glass or the water in the
[37:27] glass. But can you understand the glass
[37:29] in the water? How can the water be in
[37:32] the glass and the glass be in the water?
[37:35] That doesn't exist in this world. In
[37:37] like matter time, you don't understand
[37:39] that. We don't understand that. We
[37:40] cannot fathom that. Christ says his
[37:43] unity, the word, the unity of the word
[37:46] and the spirit is the word is in the
[37:50] spirit and the spirit is in the word.
[37:53] That's the unity. And if you read John
[37:54] 14:20, he says that must come to us.
[37:58] &gt;&gt; I am in you and you in me.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And that's a subject for a
[38:04] completely different time. May the Lord
[38:06] bless that. Amen. You can have a look at
[38:08] that yourself. But the father that
[38:10] dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.
[38:13] Glory to God. So let's look at the way
[38:15] to the father. So Christ came in the
[38:18] flesh. Now we're talking about how the
[38:20] image is restored, right? In the image
[38:22] of flesh to show us the way to the
[38:24] father or how to restore the image or
[38:27] the nature of God back to man. Why are
[38:30] we speaking of this? Because we are not
[38:32] trying in this day to restore the image
[38:35] back. We we want to know about us
[38:37] walking in the vision. The vision has
[38:40] begun to unfold itself for 2,000 years
[38:43] now. The plan of redemption. And which
[38:46] part of the vision are you walking in?
[38:48] So, we're not here to to come and
[38:50] restore the the image of nature. We
[38:52] don't have to to bring in uh some
[38:55] fantastical word or something. The word
[38:57] has been given. The word has come. The
[38:59] word came from uh from glory was formed
[39:02] in flesh and begin to unfold himself
[39:04] over seven church ages. The image and
[39:07] nature of God has come back to man has
[39:10] made a way. John 14:6 Jesus said unto
[39:13] him, I am the way, the truth, and the
[39:15] life. No man cometh unto the father but
[39:16] by me. We just read that. Let's read
[39:18] question and answers on Genesis page 21
[39:21] paragraph 61. Now, the first man, now he
[39:25] made the first man in his image, and
[39:29] we're returning back to that image.
[39:33] That's right. To our first created
[39:36] image. Glory to God. Amen. See, I didn't
[39:39] make this up, right? We're returning
[39:42] back to that image. What image? The
[39:44] image that man was first created in.
[39:47] Then Jesus says, "I go to prepare a
[39:49] place for you." What is that? In my
[39:51] father's house are many
[39:54] &gt;&gt; theophanies. I go to prepare one for
[39:56] you. The first coming puts us back in
[40:00] touch with our theophanes. In other
[40:02] words, what did Christ what did the
[40:03] first coming do? He opened the death,
[40:07] burial and resurrection of Christ.
[40:09] Opened up the doorway. It released the
[40:12] hold of death so that even now if you
[40:15] should die, you do not go into a fifth
[40:17] dimension. You are immediately in the
[40:19] sixth dimension because Christ has
[40:21] opened up that he's taken the keys of
[40:23] death, hell, and the grave away from the
[40:25] enemy. So that death is now an open door
[40:28] into the sixth dimension for those who
[40:30] wait. Now here's the thing. In my
[40:33] father's house are many theophonies. I
[40:34] go to prepare one for you. The first
[40:37] coming puts us back in touch with our
[40:39] theophonies. If you die here, you go
[40:41] into your theophony that is waiting. If
[40:44] uh uh if you are translated, you are in
[40:48] in in the transfiguration, you are
[40:50] transfigured and translated into
[40:52] theophony. Transfigured into theophony,
[40:54] translated into seventh dimension. But
[40:57] then the church must become bone of his
[41:00] bones and flesh of his flesh. Right? So
[41:03] he he said Christ said, "I'm going to
[41:05] prepare a place for you." That means I'm
[41:07] going to go and make it possible for you
[41:09] now to to begin to receive your
[41:11] theophony and I'm going to send the Holy
[41:13] Spirit and he's going to be my voice. If
[41:16] you hear his voice, if you believe his
[41:17] voice, he will bring you peace. Peace is
[41:20] harmony. He will bring you that peace,
[41:23] that harmony between the flesh and the
[41:26] spirit. He will bring you the new birth.
[41:28] He will teach you all things concerning
[41:31] me. Right? And then what happens is you
[41:34] must become one flesh. So it starts off
[41:37] becoming one flesh and moving towards
[41:40] one spirit. Right? So what is bone of
[41:43] his bone, flesh of his flesh in the
[41:44] terms of the second Adam. So here's what
[41:47] happened. What is the entire church ages
[41:50] mystery about? It is about God raising
[41:53] up a feminine body in the image of the
[41:56] second Adam. That's what the church age
[41:58] mystery is about. What is it about
[42:00] putting virtues in them? Faith, virtue,
[42:01] knowledge, temperance, patience. It is
[42:03] putting the virtues, the natures, the
[42:05] divine natures back into man. It is
[42:08] producing the fleshly nature of Christ,
[42:11] the fleshly nature of Christ, putting
[42:14] that into the gentile church, building
[42:16] up the feminine body to stand in the end
[42:20] time when the two should be united. So
[42:23] his purpose was to show the image of God
[42:26] to the church so that she could become
[42:29] the same material. So again, you know,
[42:32] when you when you rewind to Genesis 2
[42:35] and when Adam stood before his wife and
[42:37] said, "You are now bone of my bone,
[42:39] flesh of my flesh, you shall be called
[42:41] woman because you came out of man." I
[42:42] guarantee you that's not what he said
[42:45] physically to her. Just as how he called
[42:49] the names of animals, telling them what
[42:52] their purpose is, those words
[42:54] encapsulated in English, Adam was
[42:57] revealing his image to her, revealing to
[43:00] her this new body, what her purpose is,
[43:04] what the word of God is, what is the
[43:06] mystery, what the direction, what the
[43:07] vision is. He was re he was revealing
[43:10] that to her. He wasn't telling her those
[43:12] English words, you are born of my bone,
[43:13] flesh of my flesh. You know what kind of
[43:16] first words are that to to a man's wife
[43:18] anyway? Who's going to say that? I know
[43:19] that's humorous, but that's you've got
[43:21] to see beyond that. Adam like he imagine
[43:25] he called the names of the elephants and
[43:27] and and and spoke so much of beautiful
[43:30] things to them, placing them in
[43:31] ecological system, telling them which
[43:33] trees they could eat of uh when they
[43:36] should bring forth the next child and so
[43:38] on. Imagine he he he tells them this
[43:40] this magnificent story of their life.
[43:43] And here to his wife, he just tells you,
[43:45] "You're bone of my bone, flesh of my
[43:46] flesh." Obviously, there's more to that.
[43:49] There's more revelation. When when she
[43:51] was resurrected and faced him, he began
[43:54] to call her name. He began to tell her,
[43:57] "This is where you come from. This is
[43:59] who you are. This is your makeup. This
[44:01] is your design. This is your purpose."
[44:03] It must have been wonderful communion
[44:05] and fellowship. So, that's what I'm
[44:07] saying. So here when Christ resurrects
[44:09] the church when he's building up the
[44:11] body of the church to the church ages,
[44:13] he's calling her names. He's calling the
[44:16] names. He's placing them in their
[44:17] orders. He's telling them what their
[44:19] purposes for each age. The Holy Ghost
[44:21] began to tell them under the lion
[44:22] anointing. See that? Calling the name,
[44:25] the lion anointing, the ox anointing,
[44:27] the man anointing, the eagle anointing,
[44:29] giving them their their gifts, their
[44:32] abilities, telling them what their
[44:33] purpose and direction should be to do
[44:36] what? to eventually give them the
[44:38] ability to now accept the oneness, the
[44:41] likeness of God.
[44:43] &gt;&gt; So what did he do? He sent the Holy
[44:46] Ghost to give abilities to the church to
[44:49] believe the word for their day and that
[44:52] image uh could so that that image could
[44:55] be built up or or give the church
[44:57] ability to believe the word for their
[44:59] day and that image could be built up
[45:01] into mankind to receive theophony. Glory
[45:04] to God. So we have to first conform to
[45:07] the life of the Lord Jesus Christ by
[45:09] believing holy in the word for our day.
[45:13] Then when he sees um when the church
[45:18] sees that he gives us the holy ghost
[45:19] whereby we can hear the word for our day
[45:22] and allow our spirits to be changed by
[45:24] the word. The body of a man is
[45:26] controlled by his own spirit. His spirit
[45:28] is subject, our spirits are subject to
[45:31] uh fear and unbelief
[45:34] influences around us. What your teachers
[45:36] tell you, what your parents tell you,
[45:37] what your friends tell you, your spirit
[45:39] is is really subject to that. It's
[45:42] controlled by that. It falls under those
[45:44] influences. So when our spirits are
[45:46] changed into the word, then our spirits
[45:49] lose fear and doubt and our spirits
[45:52] begin to have dominion over other
[45:55] influences. You find yourself not being
[45:57] able to be indoctrinated anymore, not
[45:59] being able to be deceived by things
[46:01] anymore because the word has taken over
[46:04] the spirit. The image of God has started
[46:06] to come into the spirit. It is being
[46:08] restored.
[46:10] Saints, young people, this is the reason
[46:13] why you need to get as much of the word
[46:16] as possible. If I could say in my days
[46:19] as a teenager, things were a lot easier
[46:22] in that I could take time to get to know
[46:24] the word. But I'm telling you young
[46:26] people today, unfortunately, you don't
[46:29] have much time. You can't say to
[46:31] yourself, well, I've got five more years
[46:32] of teenage years to to take as much time
[46:36] as I want. The amount of influences
[46:39] there are that are u coming at you as
[46:43] compared to two services of two church
[46:46] meetings a week is is not enough to
[46:49] balance this. Uh when I was a teenager,
[46:52] we had so many church services a week.
[46:54] Uh and we we were were living in the
[46:57] word every single day of our lives.
[46:59] There was no internet, no cell phones,
[47:01] no social media. Uh friends had to walk
[47:05] to come and visit you. You know, the
[47:07] amount of influences there are today are
[47:10] way more than what we have in terms of
[47:12] the word and in terms of the church,
[47:14] which is the reason why you need to
[47:17] offset that. You need to have so much
[47:19] more of the word and so much or rather
[47:22] much less of the influences of his world
[47:24] for you to attain and receive the image
[47:27] of God in you. Our spirits become holy
[47:30] when our body starts to come under
[47:32] control of our spirit
[47:35] u uh of the Holy Spirit thus making our
[47:37] bodies become holy. So when our spirits
[47:40] become holy then it starts to make the
[47:42] bodies become holy. Right? People try to
[47:45] do it the other way. They try to get
[47:47] their bodies to be holy first when the
[47:49] spirit has not been made holy. You have
[47:51] to receive the image. If you receive the
[47:54] image in the spirit, then the body will
[47:56] start to manifest. You cannot do it the
[47:58] other way around. So we must have his
[48:01] image restored. In John 15:18-27,
[48:05] it says, "If the world hate you, you
[48:07] know that it hated me before it hated
[48:10] you. If you were of the world, but I
[48:12] have chose uh if you were of the world,
[48:15] the world would love his own. But
[48:17] because you are not of the world, that's
[48:18] a that's a great comfort. But I have
[48:21] chosen you out of the world, therefore
[48:23] the world hateth you. Remember the word
[48:25] that I said unto you, the servant is not
[48:27] greater than his Lord. If they have
[48:29] persecuted me, they will also persecute
[48:31] you. If they have kept my saying, they
[48:34] will keep yours also. But all these
[48:37] things will they do unto you for my
[48:40] name's sake, because they know not him
[48:42] that sent me. If I had not come and
[48:45] spoken unto them, they had not sinned.
[48:47] But now they have no cloak for their
[48:49] sin. Cloak means covering because I've
[48:51] exposed it. He that hateth me hateth my
[48:54] father also. If I had not done among
[48:57] them the works which none other man did,
[49:00] they had not had sin. But now have they
[49:02] both seen and hated both me and my
[49:05] father. Which means the people of this
[49:08] world are going to uh uh reject the word
[49:11] and by doing so reject the divine nature
[49:13] of God. They are going to spiral into
[49:16] the terrible terrible natures that we
[49:18] are actually seeing manifested in the
[49:20] world's politics and celebrities and so
[49:22] on of this world today. and it's seeping
[49:25] down into all of mankind throughout the
[49:27] earth uh due to internet, social media,
[49:30] and all the ways that man is connected.
[49:34] Verse 26 or verse 25. But this come to
[49:36] pass that the word uh this cometh to
[49:39] pass that the word might be fulfilled
[49:40] that is written in their law. They hated
[49:43] me without a cause. But when the
[49:45] comforter, the Holy Ghost is come, whom
[49:48] I will send unto you from the Father,
[49:50] even the Spirit of truth, which
[49:53] proceedth from the Father, he shall
[49:54] testify of me, and you shall also bear
[49:58] witness because you have been with me
[49:59] from the beginning. So he says to the
[50:02] church, now it's your time. You are
[50:04] going to witness the revelation of the
[50:08] image. See the image of the father is
[50:10] being expressed to you through the holy
[50:12] spirit that I am sending out to you. Now
[50:14] you are going to be the expression of
[50:16] the same image. And of course they were
[50:17] receiving it in measures. Now we move to
[50:20] the second part of this the restoration
[50:22] of the likeness. Okay you understand
[50:25] that the image was restored through
[50:27] Christ in the first coming. Now you need
[50:29] to understand what the the purpose of
[50:31] the second coming is. Right? we the
[50:34] whole world is waiting for a literal
[50:36] corporal coming of Christ. What purpose
[50:40] is there in that? And of course they
[50:42] mistake what that means. This isn't the
[50:45] coming with uh um with the saints for
[50:50] for the millennium, right? This is the
[50:53] coming where he must the purpose of the
[50:55] second coming. The purpose of the second
[50:57] coming under the seventh seal in the
[50:59] third pool ministry is for the bride.
[51:02] It's a secret coming. It's to restore
[51:04] the likeness. There's a purpose to it.
[51:07] That's not just uh coming to show the
[51:09] world, hey, you were all wrong.
[51:10] Christians were right. Christ is the
[51:12] real God of the C. That's that's all
[51:14] carnality. That's not the purpose.
[51:16] Christ doesn't just have comeings for no
[51:20] reason. The reason is the image has been
[51:23] fully restored.
[51:25] Right? The word, the divine nature has
[51:28] been taught over 2,000 years. It has
[51:30] been fully expressed by the church uh
[51:33] through the holy ghost rather by the
[51:35] holy ghost through the church fully
[51:37] expressed brought a body up in the end
[51:39] time. It is now time for the harmony to
[51:42] come back together. It is now time for
[51:44] the two to become one
[51:46] &gt;&gt; the likeness to be restored. So that's
[51:49] where we are right now. So remember what
[51:51] is image? Absolute expression of the
[51:55] nature Christ. What is the likeness?
[51:58] absolute resemblance what God looks
[52:00] like. That means uh you know this is an
[52:04] important thing to realize
[52:07] when Christ came in the first coming you
[52:10] all agree you all believe the Lord Jesus
[52:12] Christ was God himself in flesh.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:16] Isn't it amazing?
[52:18] You know, God himself in flesh stood on
[52:22] earth 2,000 years ago or more, and
[52:27] only 11 recognized him for who he was.
[52:33] I mean,
[52:37] it's God. It's the word made flesh. It's
[52:40] the son.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; He's standing there. I mean, couldn't he
[52:43] have been more convincing? Couldn't he
[52:45] have been uh uh I mean, if he stood
[52:48] there, why couldn't the world recognize
[52:51] him? I mean, you're talking about God
[52:53] himself. For 4,000 years, men were
[52:55] searching for him. He sent scriptures to
[52:58] them. He gave them the law. And there
[53:00] he's standing there and nobody's
[53:01] recognizing him. And what's with that?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Why is that?
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Because they cannot see him as God
[53:10] because his likeness is not restored
[53:12] yet. You'll see after the seventh
[53:14] trumpet
[53:15] after the seventh trumpet it says now
[53:19] are the kingdoms of this earth become
[53:21] the kingdoms of the Lord and his Christ.
[53:24] That means even when he stood there in
[53:27] the first coming the earth was not yet
[53:29] his dominion was not yet his
[53:32] enemy came to him and said bow onto me
[53:34] and I'll give you all this. Which means
[53:37] the dominion of earth while the first
[53:39] coming was on was still in the hands of
[53:41] the enemy. Remember, the inheritance
[53:43] passed into the filthy hands of Satan.
[53:46] And the whole point of the second Adam
[53:47] is to get the bride to take back the
[53:50] inheritance. So the kingdoms of the of
[53:53] the earth, the world are not even God's
[53:56] yet. They don't even it doesn't even
[53:57] belong to the Lord yet. It's it's only
[54:00] going to take place after the
[54:01] fulfillment of the seven trumpet. Now
[54:03] after the seven the the fulfillment of
[54:05] the seventh trumpet in Revelations 11
[54:07] from verse 14 to 19 it tells us now are
[54:11] the kingdoms of the world become the
[54:13] kingdoms of the Lord and his Christ.
[54:16] Right? So that's telling us that the the
[54:20] earth the millennium can only take place
[54:23] once the likeness has been restored.
[54:25] That is Christ and the bride going back
[54:27] to Eden. Okay. So the first man,
[54:31] Theophony, he was made spirit. Genesis
[54:33] 1:26-27,
[54:35] Genesis 51 and:e 2, he was in the image
[54:38] and in the likeness in the day that they
[54:41] were created. But the second man
[54:44] glorified, he was flesh in Genesis 2:7.
[54:48] He was like Colossians 2:9. He was in
[54:51] the image and in the likeness. Then when
[54:54] the woman was created, you had now man
[54:57] and woman in separate bodies,
[55:00] separated in spirit but one flesh. That
[55:04] means they were the same material. One
[55:06] flesh but separated in spiritual nature.
[55:10] That means they were in the image but
[55:12] after the likeness. Now what we're going
[55:14] to show you is that that is a problem.
[55:16] Being after the likeness is a problem.
[55:20] And that was the biggest problem and it
[55:21] still is the biggest problem. So God
[55:23] wants to restore us back to being in the
[55:26] image and in the likeness, right? That
[55:29] will be the millennium condition. Now we
[55:31] know that the image has been restored
[55:34] through Christ. He brought the word back
[55:36] to us by the new birth. We are able to
[55:39] become the word. However, his likeness
[55:42] without us cannot be made perfect. Amen.
[55:47] his likeness, the likeness of God.
[55:50] Without us, Christ cannot be made
[55:52] perfect standing there 2,000 years ago.
[55:54] He needed the bride to come into perfect
[55:58] harmony with him here in flesh. Now, in
[56:00] Adam, the woman could not be seen in
[56:04] Genesis 2:7 until she was he was put to
[56:06] sleep and the woman was taken out. In
[56:08] Christ, the church could not be seen
[56:11] until after Calvary. You read 1
[56:13] Corinthians 1 Corinthians 11:1-4.
[56:17] Would to God you could bear with me a
[56:19] little in my folly and indeed bear with
[56:22] me for I am jealous over you with a
[56:24] godly jealousy. For I have espoused you
[56:26] to one husband that I may present you as
[56:29] a chasteed virgin to Christ. But I fear
[56:32] lest by any means as the spirit beguiled
[56:34] Eve through his satility, so your mind
[56:38] should be corrupted from the simplicity
[56:39] that is in Christ. For if he that cometh
[56:42] preacheth another Jesus whom we have not
[56:45] preached, or if you receive another
[56:48] spirit which you have not received, or
[56:50] another gospel which you have not
[56:52] accepted, you might well bear with him.
[56:56] See, Paul is saying, "I'm afraid that if
[56:58] you receive something or hear some
[57:01] preaching that we have not preached or
[57:03] another spirit that we have not
[57:05] received, then you might uh bear with
[57:08] him means you might continue to listen
[57:10] to him and you might go on with him."
[57:13] Paul is saying, "I am jealous over you.
[57:16] Protective, watchful, careful. I get
[57:19] upset. I feel offended when you even
[57:22] consider anything else but what I preach
[57:24] to you." This is quite a confession of a
[57:27] preacher, right? I am jealous over you.
[57:29] Now, this is of course is godly
[57:30] jealousy. Earthly jealousy is not of
[57:32] God. You find here, we even see it in in
[57:35] God when he spoke to the the Hebrews.
[57:38] Exodus 20:5 says, "Thou shalt not bow
[57:41] down thyself to them, nor serve them,
[57:42] for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God,
[57:45] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[57:46] upon the children unto the third and
[57:48] fourth generation of them that hate me."
[57:50] Exodus 34:14 says, "For thou shalt
[57:54] worship no other god, for the Lord whose
[57:57] name is jealous, is a jealous God." In
[58:00] other words, at this time, his name,
[58:02] God's name is not jealous. What does
[58:04] that mean? It means he's telling us he's
[58:06] got a character that is possessive over
[58:09] what is his. Deuteronomy 4:24, for the
[58:13] Lord thy God is a consuming fire, even a
[58:17] jealous God. All right. So this
[58:21] expressed in our language, the deep hurt
[58:24] mixed with anger is what God feels about
[58:27] idolatry. It is spiritual adultery.
[58:30] Right? Paul sensed this and compares
[58:33] God's jealousy to marital jealousy
[58:36] where Paul uses the word espouse. I've
[58:38] espoused you. That means betrothed or
[58:41] engaged or promised to be married.
[58:44] Right? And then he says, "As a chasteed
[58:46] virgin," meaning pure, undefiled,
[58:48] virtuous, untouched. Verse three shows
[58:52] that Paul was aware that a deception was
[58:54] coming that would cause the church to
[58:56] stumble into spiritual adultery. Verse
[58:59] four shows us that Paul was fearful of
[59:01] them receiving, I want you to get this,
[59:04] another spirit through preaching.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:11] &gt;&gt; Why? because his spirit, his image was
[59:13] supposed to be transferred to us through
[59:15] the preaching of the word. But Paul was
[59:17] afraid that another spirit was going to
[59:19] come in through preaching and that if
[59:21] the people or the church received it,
[59:23] they would go into error. And that is
[59:25] exactly what happened. So Paul wanted to
[59:28] keep their spirits right. It must have
[59:32] really depressed him. I think the
[59:34] historians actually tell us that Paul
[59:35] was the the depressed apostle. It must
[59:38] have really depressed him when he began
[59:40] to see the false doctrines coming in and
[59:42] people adearing to them. So the church
[59:45] was becoming one flesh. Now I want I
[59:48] want you to understand what one flesh
[59:50] means. The church was becoming one flesh
[59:52] with Christ after Calvary and the the
[59:55] Holy Ghost. How? So what did it mean
[59:58] they were one flesh?
[1:00:00] The Holy Ghost gave power to the flesh
[1:00:03] to be like Christ. Just think about
[1:00:06] this. prior to uh you know there's a lot
[1:00:08] of things when you think about the world
[1:00:10] today as compared to the days of Moses.
[1:00:13] If you look at uh this is one of the
[1:00:16] most glorious days if you if you look at
[1:00:17] the entire world right now the entire
[1:00:19] globe you can go to any continent and
[1:00:22] you've got preachers of this message who
[1:00:24] are the greatest teachers that have ever
[1:00:26] lived since the beginning of man.
[1:00:30] Moses the great man was not a teacher.
[1:00:34] He didn't teach a thing. He just went
[1:00:36] into the shikina of glory. He came out
[1:00:38] and said exactly what God said to him.
[1:00:41] If people asked him, "Well, Moses, how
[1:00:42] do you interpret this?" Says, "Uh, I
[1:00:45] don't know. Let me go ask God." And then
[1:00:47] he goes back in the presence, he comes
[1:00:48] out with an answer. Today, you've got
[1:00:50] teachers. You've got men. For the first
[1:00:53] time in in in the history of mankind,
[1:00:56] you've got people teaching the gospel.
[1:00:59] Listen, let me put it to you this way.
[1:01:03] teachers of this message have taught
[1:01:05] more of the word than even the Lord
[1:01:07] Jesus Christ did in his three and a half
[1:01:09] years.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Think of that. We've preached more
[1:01:12] messages. We've done more teaching.
[1:01:14] We've done more explaining of the word.
[1:01:16] We've done more answering questions than
[1:01:18] any Bible character that ever lived.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; You have to see that as as huge,
[1:01:27] magnificent, amazing, right? How did
[1:01:30] this happen? Because the Holy Ghost
[1:01:34] gave ability to flesh that did not have
[1:01:37] that ability previously. I don't think
[1:01:39] you even you even realize how bad it
[1:01:42] was. Um, if you just go 2,000 years ago,
[1:01:47] the the the
[1:01:49] mentality of man just 2,000 years ago,
[1:01:53] not even 2,000 years ago, if you go in
[1:01:55] your own countries, if you just go 500
[1:01:58] years back, men and women could not even
[1:02:01] have a conversation because that's how
[1:02:04] limited their reasoning mentality was.
[1:02:07] Today, we can sit down at coffee shops,
[1:02:09] have conversations. When we talk about
[1:02:11] the word, we could go on for hours. Can
[1:02:14] you imagine even in the days of Luther
[1:02:16] Wesley, that's the time when it started
[1:02:19] coming in. But can you imagine way back
[1:02:21] in the time of Moses uh him and his wife
[1:02:24] standing there talking about the law
[1:02:28] that was just given, expounding it out
[1:02:30] to one another, typing it with this and
[1:02:32] that, fellowshipping over it, getting so
[1:02:36] uh uh joyful about the the wisdom behind
[1:02:39] it. That never happened. They never had
[1:02:41] such abilities. Man did not possess
[1:02:44] abilities like that. Moreover, there was
[1:02:47] no abilities of healing, prophesying,
[1:02:50] speaking with tongues. None of those
[1:02:52] things. Of course, in the Old Testament,
[1:02:54] they were blessed with with um miracles
[1:02:58] where God was doing things. They called
[1:03:01] for things, things began to happen. That
[1:03:03] was a great time. But personally their
[1:03:05] flesh had no ability because the Holy
[1:03:09] Ghost was not yet given and that is
[1:03:11] scripture. So the Holy Ghost gave power
[1:03:14] to the flesh to be like Christ. That
[1:03:17] means the same works Christ did simple
[1:03:20] normal unworthy human beings were now
[1:03:23] doing. They were healing people,
[1:03:25] prophesying, speaking with tongues,
[1:03:28] telling people what's going to happen in
[1:03:29] the future, advising kings and
[1:03:31] dignitaries. It was incredible what this
[1:03:34] new church was doing. They were becoming
[1:03:36] one flesh, right? Doing signs and
[1:03:39] wonders in greater magnitudes than that
[1:03:41] Christ did in that three and a half year
[1:03:42] period. Here we are seeing the church
[1:03:45] becoming one flesh with Christ by the
[1:03:48] acts of the Holy Ghost. Same actions,
[1:03:51] same works as Christ. Now what's the
[1:03:54] difference between being one flesh and
[1:03:56] one spirit?
[1:03:58] When he sent the Holy Ghost, they were
[1:04:00] so one with him, right? In harmony, the
[1:04:04] upper room, down came the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:06] They were unity of spirit and uh uh one
[1:04:12] one in spirit and brought the one in
[1:04:13] flesh, right? They were getting so close
[1:04:16] to a marriage getting ready
[1:04:19] uh
[1:04:21] to receive the depth of the word. end
[1:04:23] when like Eve the enemy began to creep
[1:04:26] in with an interpretation of the word
[1:04:28] that was not entirely true. Why did it
[1:04:31] happen? Because instead of wanting more
[1:04:34] of the unity of the spirit with Christ,
[1:04:38] the gentile church be became just so
[1:04:41] satisfied with the unity of the flesh.
[1:04:43] They began to lust after the Holy Ghost.
[1:04:45] They wanted more power. They wanted more
[1:04:46] healings. They wanted more miracles.
[1:04:48] They wanted more gifts, more abilities.
[1:04:51] And they were fascinated with the
[1:04:52] oneness of the flesh.
[1:04:55] But being after the likeness is not good
[1:04:58] enough to beat sin. All right? Being in
[1:05:02] the likeness, that's real perfection.
[1:05:05] After the likeness, what did that cause
[1:05:08] again? The church lay with the beast.
[1:05:13] Like in Eden, the church lay with the
[1:05:15] beast of Rome. And what did that
[1:05:17] produce? She fell at the council of Nika
[1:05:20] by accepting another spirit. Being after
[1:05:23] the likeness leaves opportunity for
[1:05:25] accepting another spiritual headship. In
[1:05:28] other words, these two shall be one
[1:05:31] flesh is not good enough. But one
[1:05:34] spirit, that's the perfection God seeks.
[1:05:38] Romans 8:13-14, you know these
[1:05:40] scriptures. For if you live by after the
[1:05:42] flesh, you shall die. But if you through
[1:05:45] the spirit do mortify the deeds of the
[1:05:47] body, you shall live. For as many as are
[1:05:49] led by the spirit of God, they are the
[1:05:51] sons of God. Being one in the flesh,
[1:05:54] saints, puts us in danger of bringing
[1:05:56] the law upon us. Just think about that.
[1:05:58] The more gifts given to the church, the
[1:06:02] more prophecies, healings, miracles, the
[1:06:05] more law has to be given to control
[1:06:07] those things. And the more control
[1:06:09] brings corruption because the mighty
[1:06:12] begin to take control and those of the
[1:06:15] leoty begin to be ruled. It goes back to
[1:06:18] uh to corruption again. So being one in
[1:06:21] flesh puts us in danger of bringing the
[1:06:23] law. This is the reason Christ came to
[1:06:25] magnify the law so that no one could
[1:06:28] live by it. You know what I mean? When
[1:06:30] he said uh I Moses said unto you, thou
[1:06:33] shalt not kill. I say unto you, if you
[1:06:35] if you are angry with your brother
[1:06:36] without a cause, you have killed
[1:06:38] already. That's like the Pharisees
[1:06:39] saying, well, we keep the law of Moses,
[1:06:41] we didn't kill. Christ is saying you you
[1:06:43] thought of it. The fact that you thought
[1:06:45] of it shows your spirit is not right
[1:06:47] means you did it. In other words, what
[1:06:48] Christ was doing was making the law so
[1:06:51] big, so unmanageable,
[1:06:54] so difficult to attain perfection by the
[1:06:58] law that you need grace.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you need grace because
[1:07:02] he did You took past the flesh, went
[1:07:06] into the spirit realm and says, "If you
[1:07:07] say you have not committed adultery, but
[1:07:10] you lusted after someone, you're guilty
[1:07:12] as if you did the act, therefore, you
[1:07:14] need grace."
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Because anyone can claim to have not
[1:07:17] done it in the flesh, but to have
[1:07:19] thought about it. Well, of course,
[1:07:20] everyone will say, "We've thought about
[1:07:21] it." So, that's why we're going to need
[1:07:24] grace. So, he had to make the law
[1:07:26] magnified. Too large. Magnified means to
[1:07:29] make larger. He didn't do away with it.
[1:07:32] He made it larger so that people would
[1:07:35] have to have grace to attain perfection.
[1:07:38] So it is very difficult for the female
[1:07:41] nature to keep the law unless her
[1:07:44] husband is present with her. Especially
[1:07:46] if the law is magnified. I mean it it's
[1:07:48] worse. You'll have to have the husband
[1:07:51] with you. You'll have to be present
[1:07:54] with her just like Eve. So Eve. So there
[1:07:57] there are times in the early church
[1:07:59] where a leader who had the Holy Ghost or
[1:08:01] was not present and if he was not
[1:08:04] present it was as good as Christ not
[1:08:05] being present leaving the church at the
[1:08:07] mercy of any deceiver that came in.
[1:08:11] But this was always going to be the test
[1:08:13] whether or not the church would be able
[1:08:15] to stand the word test. At these times
[1:08:17] in the church when the Holy Ghost was
[1:08:19] not present, the church dominated,
[1:08:21] taking the law of a creed or a dogma,
[1:08:24] binding herself under a false headship.
[1:08:26] These uh subtly false or subtle false
[1:08:30] teachings only satisfied one's
[1:08:33] conscience by doing certain works and
[1:08:35] rituals to obtain full salvation. Right?
[1:08:39] So this is a real problem because the
[1:08:42] church was lusting after the gifts of
[1:08:44] the Holy Ghost rather than wanting the
[1:08:47] revelation of the word. Romans 6:1-14.
[1:08:51] What shall we say then? Shall we
[1:08:52] continue in sin that grace may abound?
[1:08:54] God forbid. How shall we that are dead
[1:08:56] to sin live any longer therein? Know you
[1:09:00] not that so many of us as were baptized
[1:09:02] into Jesus Christ were baptized into his
[1:09:04] death? Therefore, we are buried with him
[1:09:06] by baptism into death. that like as
[1:09:08] Christ was risen up or raised up from
[1:09:10] the dead by the glory of the father,
[1:09:12] even so also should we walk in newness
[1:09:15] of life. For if we have been planted
[1:09:18] together in the likeness of his death,
[1:09:19] we shall also be in the likeness of his
[1:09:21] resurrection. Knowing this that our old
[1:09:23] man is crucified with him that the body
[1:09:26] of sin might be destroyed. Now watch
[1:09:29] that. our old man
[1:09:32] uh is crucified with him that the body
[1:09:35] of sin might be destroyed. That
[1:09:37] henceforth we should not serve sin. For
[1:09:40] he that is dead is freed from sin. Now
[1:09:43] if we be dead with Christ, we believe
[1:09:45] that we shall also live with him.
[1:09:48] Knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:09:49] the dead dieth no more, death had no
[1:09:52] more dominion over him. For in that he
[1:09:55] died, he died unto sin once, but in that
[1:09:59] he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise
[1:10:02] reckon you also yourselves to be dead
[1:10:05] indeed unto sin, but alive unto God
[1:10:07] through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not
[1:10:10] sin therefore reign in your mortal body,
[1:10:12] that you should obey it in the lust
[1:10:14] thereof. That means don't succumb to the
[1:10:17] mortal body. Right? He's what what Paul
[1:10:20] is teaching us here is we need to come
[1:10:22] to the perfection of the spirit.
[1:10:25] Verse 13, neither yield you your members
[1:10:28] as instruments of unrighteousness unto
[1:10:30] sin, but yield yourselves unto God as
[1:10:32] those that are alive from the dead, and
[1:10:34] your members as instruments of
[1:10:35] righteousness unto God. For sin shall
[1:10:38] not have dominion over you. For you are
[1:10:40] not under the law, but under grace. See,
[1:10:45] this is the problem we have with people
[1:10:47] today in the message. You've taken the
[1:10:49] message and made it another law. And
[1:10:51] it's really like Christ said to the
[1:10:53] Pharisees, a burden too much for the
[1:10:56] people to bear that those who create the
[1:10:58] law and make it even bigger in the
[1:11:00] message don't even follow it themselves.
[1:11:03] You're not under law but under grace. So
[1:11:05] that sin could not have dominion over
[1:11:07] us. Listen, if you follow the teaching
[1:11:09] in Romans, it tells you the greater you
[1:11:11] make the law and force the people to
[1:11:14] live by the law, you're asking them to
[1:11:16] be one flesh. And one flesh again is
[1:11:18] going to lead to problems. Which is why
[1:11:21] message churches all over the world are
[1:11:23] starting to have all these problems
[1:11:24] coming back in. infidelities,
[1:11:27] adulteries, fornications,
[1:11:30] whole a whole lot of problems coming
[1:11:33] back in misunderstandings. Like the
[1:11:35] simple things that pertain to the flesh
[1:11:37] are are are causing the people to become
[1:11:40] uh u dejected and deceived and and
[1:11:44] causing them to to fall fall away and
[1:11:46] faint in their faith.
[1:11:49] Why? because you're pushing law instead
[1:11:52] of what is true, what is right, what is
[1:11:55] the vision. See, if you push law, sin is
[1:11:59] going to take control again. You're not
[1:12:02] going to have dominion over sin. This
[1:12:04] scripture shows us that living by the
[1:12:06] flesh, trying to find the likeness after
[1:12:10] the flesh, in other words, after the
[1:12:12] likeness is only going to fail. We are
[1:12:15] going to fail by the law time and time
[1:12:17] again. Any message church who runs
[1:12:20] itself by the law is going to fail. And
[1:12:23] how are you going to fail? You're going
[1:12:25] to spiritually lie with the beast again.
[1:12:28] You're going to bring in a political
[1:12:30] spirit that's going to join church and
[1:12:31] state. And what's going to happen is
[1:12:33] you're going to fall into false
[1:12:34] doctrine. The only way out is to accept
[1:12:37] the way of Christ. Let the way of the
[1:12:40] flesh die.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come to the unity of the spirit.
[1:12:44] Get into the word. Get into the third
[1:12:46] pole. Get into the real depths of the
[1:12:49] message. Find the the unity of the
[1:12:52] spirit. Find the true likeness, the
[1:12:54] likeness, the two attributes becoming
[1:12:56] one. Get into the third pole, the soul
[1:12:58] realm. Glory to God. Romans 7:7 to11.
[1:13:02] You know this scripture very well. What
[1:13:05] shall we say then? Is the law sin? God
[1:13:08] forbid. No. We're not saying the
[1:13:10] standards of the message are wrong.
[1:13:11] We're not saying don't do this and
[1:13:13] don't. Absolutely not. Those things must
[1:13:16] happen. But you don't force those things
[1:13:18] to happen. Right? God forbid. Nay, I had
[1:13:21] not known sin but by the law. That means
[1:13:23] the law told me what was wrong. I came
[1:13:26] to the knowledge of what was wrong
[1:13:28] because the law made it evident to me.
[1:13:30] For I had not known lust except the law
[1:13:32] had said, "Thou shalt not coveret."
[1:13:35] But sin took occasion by the
[1:13:38] commandment, right? Wrought in me all
[1:13:41] manner of concupisence. That means uh
[1:13:45] sin took advantage because of the law
[1:13:48] that was now made known to me. And now
[1:13:50] that I know how wrong the thing is, more
[1:13:53] terrible thoughts begin to come inside.
[1:13:55] So that now I feel more leaning to want
[1:13:58] to do something. For without the law,
[1:14:00] sin was dead. That means unbelief was
[1:14:04] dead. But for for I was alive without
[1:14:07] the law once. Without knowing what was
[1:14:09] wrong, I went ahead doing things. I was
[1:14:11] free. I didn't think about if I do this,
[1:14:14] they're going to say something. If I do
[1:14:16] this, I'm I'm going to be persecuted.
[1:14:18] I'm not going to make it in the rapture.
[1:14:20] I'm not I didn't even have those
[1:14:21] thoughts. I was such a free, loving,
[1:14:23] carefree person, right? Without knowing
[1:14:27] the standards of the of the of the word.
[1:14:29] But when the commandment came, sin
[1:14:31] revived. It made me a more caged person
[1:14:33] and I died. And the commandment which
[1:14:36] was ordained to life, that means the
[1:14:38] things that were taught in Cood that was
[1:14:40] supposed to bring life to us, supposed
[1:14:43] to make life better, I found making my
[1:14:45] life so much worse. The the dos and
[1:14:48] don'ts of the message that was supposed
[1:14:49] to make us happy and make marriages
[1:14:52] better and make parenting better and
[1:14:54] make brotherhood better in the church
[1:14:56] began to make things worse.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because sin took occasion by the
[1:15:01] commandment. Why? Because we thought
[1:15:04] that was the vision. We thought we
[1:15:06] should be controlling the church so that
[1:15:09] you know make sure you marry this one
[1:15:11] that one we don't think you should I
[1:15:13] don't care if you fall in love with that
[1:15:15] one. This was not what somebody's else's
[1:15:17] dream told us. You must and what are you
[1:15:19] doing you by someone else's dream you
[1:15:21] put two people together who don't even
[1:15:23] love each other. And what do you expect
[1:15:24] when two people don't love each other? A
[1:15:26] bad marriage. Of course, things like
[1:15:29] that have been happening because people
[1:15:31] were taking the standards of the message
[1:15:33] and pushing that as the commandment and
[1:15:36] trying to make people and force people
[1:15:39] to find a oneness after the likeness.
[1:15:43] And that is going to lead to problems.
[1:15:45] That is not the vision for this day. In
[1:15:47] the likeness is the vision. For sin
[1:15:50] taken occasion by the commandment
[1:15:52] deceive me and by it slew me. The law is
[1:15:55] not sin saints but it brought the
[1:15:57] knowledge of sin bringing guilt upon us
[1:16:00] and when we transgress. So trying to
[1:16:02] live a Christian life by conforming to
[1:16:04] good works only ends in pride,
[1:16:07] embarrassment and failure. Romans 8 and
[1:16:11] verse 1 to8 there is now there is
[1:16:13] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:16:15] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:16:17] after the flesh but after the spirit.
[1:16:19] Amen. There it is. You want to walk in
[1:16:22] the vision. Don't walk after the flesh.
[1:16:25] walk after the spirit. Young people,
[1:16:27] people in the church, this is not to
[1:16:30] tell you, well, you see, our pastors are
[1:16:32] wrong. They're enforcing this, they're
[1:16:34] enforcing that, they're enforcing this.
[1:16:35] You know, I've got a problem with you
[1:16:39] saying that if your pastor is not
[1:16:41] preaching the third,
[1:16:43] if your pastor is preaching the third,
[1:16:45] he's preaching the the from the revealed
[1:16:47] word of the hour and he's trying to get
[1:16:49] the church in order, he's got to handle
[1:16:52] both sides. He's going to handle the
[1:16:53] realms of the flesh and the spirit. But
[1:16:56] you'll know if you have a ministry that
[1:16:58] is not preaching from the spirit.
[1:17:02] Then all he's doing is controlling the
[1:17:03] flesh. And of course, we know what's
[1:17:05] going to happen eventually. Ministers
[1:17:07] themselves fall into sin. Verse two, for
[1:17:11] the law of the spirit of life in Christ
[1:17:13] Jesus hath made me free from the law of
[1:17:15] sin and death. for what the law could
[1:17:17] not do in that it was weak through the
[1:17:19] flesh. God sending his own son in the
[1:17:22] likeness of sinful flesh. For sin
[1:17:25] condemns sin in the flesh that the
[1:17:28] righteousness of the law might be
[1:17:29] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:17:32] flesh but after the spirit. So he's
[1:17:34] saying the righteousness revealed in the
[1:17:37] law must be fulfilled in us by not
[1:17:39] walking after the flesh but by walking
[1:17:41] after the spirit. It's totally contrary
[1:17:44] to the to all the things the church
[1:17:45] world thinks of. Everyone says you've
[1:17:47] got to fast and pray. You've got to do
[1:17:49] this. You've got to do so many times a
[1:17:50] year. You've got to pray at this time.
[1:17:52] You got to read at that time. Got to go
[1:17:53] to church so many times. Or some believe
[1:17:55] church on Saturdays. Some believe church
[1:17:57] on Sundays. Keep this tradition. Keep
[1:17:58] that tradition. That's walking after the
[1:18:00] flesh. And the righteousness of the law
[1:18:03] will not be fulfilled in you if you walk
[1:18:05] after the flesh. But if you walk after
[1:18:07] the spirit, if you walk in the true
[1:18:09] vision,
[1:18:10] the righteousness of law will be
[1:18:12] fulfilled. Amen. Don't try so hard to
[1:18:15] keep the message rules.
[1:18:18] Try to come in love. Come in love with
[1:18:20] the word. And those things that you call
[1:18:23] message rules don't even become rules
[1:18:26] because the father loveth the son.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. The nature loves the
[1:18:32] manifestation. The nature is one with
[1:18:34] the manifestation. It you can't do it
[1:18:37] the other way. Walking in the vision is
[1:18:39] simple. But we complicate it. We try to
[1:18:42] do it the way because we love the you
[1:18:45] see to keep the the the standards of the
[1:18:47] message to keep the life that people are
[1:18:49] talking about is quite amazing. If you
[1:18:52] can do it, you get a lot of respect. But
[1:18:54] that's where human pride comes in.
[1:18:57] Because if you can do it well, people
[1:18:59] respect you and say, "Oh, what a holy
[1:19:00] brother he is. He's just such a clean
[1:19:03] living man. He just, you know, he prays
[1:19:06] every day. He dresses right. He does
[1:19:08] this. He preaches this way." And so on.
[1:19:10] And and people look at the flesh and
[1:19:12] consider that and and they and they look
[1:19:15] to that and try to pattern themselves
[1:19:17] after that. But if you look into the
[1:19:18] man's nature,
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; his divine nature, and how he's
[1:19:22] connected with God, and when you ask him
[1:19:24] a question, he's got the answers to the
[1:19:27] devil's question. He's got the answers
[1:19:30] to the doubt that might have been
[1:19:32] brought into you. He can calm your
[1:19:34] spirit. He can soothe your spirit. He
[1:19:36] can set your confusion at bay. There's a
[1:19:38] different kind of person than someone
[1:19:40] who tells you, "Listen, your problem is
[1:19:42] you don't have the Holy Ghost. Go and
[1:19:43] pray and get the Holy Ghost and then
[1:19:45] come back and speak to me." That's not
[1:19:47] how one who is in unity with the spirit
[1:19:50] will speak. Uh verse four, the
[1:19:53] righteousness of the law might be
[1:19:55] fulfilled in us. Verse five, for they
[1:19:57] are that are after the flesh do mind the
[1:20:00] things of the flesh, but they that are
[1:20:02] after the spirit, the things of the
[1:20:03] spirit. That mean that tells us they who
[1:20:06] walk after who feel the vision is after
[1:20:08] the flesh. They're constantly have that
[1:20:11] in their mind. But those who are who
[1:20:14] walk after the spirit constantly have
[1:20:16] revelation on their mind, the open book,
[1:20:18] the communion of the word, loving how
[1:20:21] the word fits together, loving how the
[1:20:23] word reveals inside, loving how the word
[1:20:25] brings wisdom inside us. That's the
[1:20:27] likeness coming back. That's the unity.
[1:20:29] That's the harmony coming back. No
[1:20:31] waring. Where's the waring? In the mind,
[1:20:34] right? The greatest battle. That's where
[1:20:36] the likeness must must destroy the
[1:20:40] reasoning that caused all the problems
[1:20:42] in the Garden of Eden. Glory to God.
[1:20:45] For to be carnally minded is death, but
[1:20:48] to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:20:49] peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:20:52] against God. For it is not subject to
[1:20:54] the law of God, neither indeed can be.
[1:20:57] So then they that are in the flesh
[1:20:59] cannot please God. There you go, saints.
[1:21:03] They that are in the flesh cannot please
[1:21:05] God. So I said enough on that. Living
[1:21:08] after the spirit saints, if you live by
[1:21:10] the third poor ministry,
[1:21:13] I cannot tell you it's the freest
[1:21:15] feeling in the world. I don't care how
[1:21:18] many message believers in the world or
[1:21:19] people who call themselves believers
[1:21:21] point their fingers at me, say what they
[1:21:23] want to, I am at peace. They can call me
[1:21:26] all sorts of names. They can talk behind
[1:21:28] my back. I don't even have to respond to
[1:21:30] it. It doesn't even concern me. is the
[1:21:33] freest feeling in the world to be united
[1:21:36] with him in spirit. To be totally secure
[1:21:40] in what you believe, to see the word, to
[1:21:42] see it unfold, to thirst after it, to
[1:21:45] fall in love with it daily again and
[1:21:47] again. Living after the spirit means not
[1:21:50] conforming to good works. That was for
[1:21:52] the church ages. But allowing the spirit
[1:21:55] to change the nature that the good works
[1:21:57] might follow. Amen. So God actually
[1:22:01] desires the union of the spirit. This is
[1:22:04] the true marriage. Amen. The church
[1:22:08] tried the likeness of the flesh. But the
[1:22:10] true marriage is the marriage of the two
[1:22:12] attributes. These two must become one
[1:22:15] under the second coming of the Lord. The
[1:22:17] seventh seal brings him back to earth.
[1:22:20] He wants us to be one in spirit saints
[1:22:22] with the word Christ. This was his
[1:22:25] desire. Let's close this down.
[1:22:28] This was his desire in Ezekiel 36:24-27.
[1:22:32] He wants us first to come to the union
[1:22:34] of Genesis 1:26-27.
[1:22:37] The union of theophony. See, that's the
[1:22:39] part we bypassed. We came here into
[1:22:41] flesh and he he brought Christ down and
[1:22:44] then gave us brought us into flesh and
[1:22:47] begin to make us one flesh. But the hope
[1:22:50] was to bring us back to theophony. He
[1:22:53] brings theophony back in this in the
[1:22:55] seventh seal being open. He brings the
[1:22:58] word theophony back to earth and the two
[1:23:01] must become one. Must become one in
[1:23:03] theophony. See, so his plan of
[1:23:06] redemption became our saving grace. Now
[1:23:09] I want to take you to those eight points
[1:23:11] we began in the beginning. Uh I want to
[1:23:13] show you this. He number one he took
[1:23:16] care of our sinful vows at Calvary
[1:23:18] taking them all upon himself. In numbers
[1:23:21] 39
[1:23:23] verse 9 verse 11 to 12 verse 14 to 15
[1:23:26] you can read the church could not see
[1:23:28] this what is this the vows of a of a
[1:23:31] woman made in her father's house and not
[1:23:33] in her father's house and how they stand
[1:23:35] and so on you can go and read that it
[1:23:37] had to become personal a personal
[1:23:40] revelation to every believer number two
[1:23:43] he held his peace with Israel that their
[1:23:46] bond might stand right but he made all
[1:23:51] our bonds void. Remember Peter, he did
[1:23:54] it knowing all the bonds before we could
[1:23:57] even make them. He told Peter, "You're
[1:24:00] going to deny me." But he made all his
[1:24:02] bonds void. Right? Whereas in Numbers
[1:24:05] 30:3 to 5, point number three, when it
[1:24:09] was not in the father's house, right?
[1:24:12] When the bonds are made not in the
[1:24:14] father's house, the church did not know
[1:24:16] the father. They were not in his house.
[1:24:19] the word. That's why they could not see
[1:24:21] the inheritance. Christ knew they they
[1:24:24] wouldn't see it. Right? So when if you
[1:24:27] don't understand this in number study,
[1:24:29] it shows how that when a woman is in her
[1:24:31] father's house and she makes a vow and
[1:24:34] the father hears the vow in the day that
[1:24:36] she makes it and he voids the vow, she
[1:24:39] is not held responsible. He is not held
[1:24:41] responsible. But if he hears the vow and
[1:24:44] he allows the vow uh then the bond will
[1:24:47] stand. Right? But if she is not in the
[1:24:50] father's house, she makes a vow. And of
[1:24:53] course, then that vow, she's bound to
[1:24:55] that vow. Right? Now, these were not in
[1:24:58] his house. What is his house? His house
[1:25:00] is the word. This church that grew up
[1:25:03] now in the in the church ages, they left
[1:25:05] his house. They left his image. That's
[1:25:08] why they could not see the inheritance.
[1:25:10] And Christ knew they wouldn't see it. If
[1:25:12] you read John 14:1-2, let not your heart
[1:25:14] be troubled. You believe in God, believe
[1:25:16] also in me. In my father's house are
[1:25:19] many mansions. If it were not so, I
[1:25:21] would have told you. I go to prepare a
[1:25:22] place for you. So, he promised to return
[1:25:25] to put us in our position in Christ, our
[1:25:28] inheritance in the word. Point number
[1:25:31] four, he was returning for someone of
[1:25:34] the same lineage. Amen. Someone who was
[1:25:37] kin to him. If you read Song of Solomon,
[1:25:41] a garden enclosed, this is four, Song of
[1:25:43] Solomon 4:12. And a garden enclosed is
[1:25:47] my sister, my spouse, my sister, my
[1:25:50] spouse. A a spring shut up, a fountain
[1:25:53] sealed. Song of Solomon 5 and verse one.
[1:25:57] I am come into my garden, my sister, my
[1:26:00] spouse. I have gathered my with my
[1:26:02] spice. I've eaten my honeycomb with my
[1:26:04] honey. I've dropped my wine with my
[1:26:05] milk. Eat, O friends. Drink ye drink
[1:26:08] abundantly, oh beloved. It means
[1:26:10] rejoice. What is Christ? What is it
[1:26:13] saying here? Christ's family would not
[1:26:15] be after the flesh. That was Adam's
[1:26:18] family, right? Christ's family is the
[1:26:21] word. So my sister, my spouse, meaning
[1:26:25] you've got to be of the same lineage.
[1:26:27] Your lineage is the word, not the flesh.
[1:26:32] Right? So he will he will come into
[1:26:34] unity with those who are of his lineage,
[1:26:37] the sister of the same father,
[1:26:41] the same image, the same origin. Point
[1:26:44] number five, Eliza was sent by the
[1:26:47] father
[1:26:49] Abraham with godly jealousy to espouse
[1:26:52] her to one husband, the word Isaac.
[1:26:56] Eliza had to go to the father's house or
[1:26:59] the father's land. His message would
[1:27:01] seek out those who were in the word. Is
[1:27:04] that right?
[1:27:07] And to make her now uh to make her know
[1:27:10] that she is a daughter born with an
[1:27:13] inheritance.
[1:27:15] You'll find that in Numbers 36 and:8.
[1:27:17] That's why we recognize the word when he
[1:27:20] came. Why did we recognize the word when
[1:27:22] he came? Because we were family to him.
[1:27:25] The only way you can recognize the word
[1:27:28] when he comes. The only way you can
[1:27:30] realize what the cloud is, what the
[1:27:32] first fold of the seven seal is, what
[1:27:33] the second fold of the seven seal is,
[1:27:35] what the third fold of the seven seals,
[1:27:37] you can only recognize that because you
[1:27:40] are family because you have the ability,
[1:27:42] you have the the genetics to recognize
[1:27:46] it. You have the added dimension to you
[1:27:48] to make you see the word to recognize
[1:27:51] who it is that has come. This was no
[1:27:54] fleshly union, not law. It is love. the
[1:27:58] capstone. It takes us back to the place
[1:28:01] prepared in the father's house where our
[1:28:03] bonds are void eternally because we're
[1:28:06] in the father's house. Anything that we
[1:28:08] do in this flesh where we make mistakes
[1:28:11] voids it.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we are united in spirit.
[1:28:15] The things that you do in the flesh that
[1:28:17] you make a mistake, you you've done
[1:28:19] wrong things, he voids it. But if you're
[1:28:21] not in his image, it is not. It stands.
[1:28:24] Your bond stands. What does that mean?
[1:28:26] because it's telling you about numbers
[1:28:28] chapter 30. If you live after the flesh,
[1:28:30] you are not in the father's house. You
[1:28:32] in Adam's house, right? House means
[1:28:34] family. Lineage, genealogy. If you are
[1:28:39] in the spirit, then you are in the
[1:28:41] father's house.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; And when you're in the father's house,
[1:28:44] whatever the flesh commits, you are not
[1:28:46] that is void. He voids it because that
[1:28:49] is not the original image of God. The
[1:28:53] original image of God is the house of
[1:28:55] the Lord. So he takes us back to the
[1:28:58] place prepared in the father's house. I
[1:29:00] go to prepare a place for you. In my
[1:29:02] father's house are many mansions. No
[1:29:05] matter what mistakes or errors we make
[1:29:08] in this life, saints. Henceforth the
[1:29:10] word makes them void immediately. This
[1:29:13] is the reason why you can feel free if
[1:29:16] you get into that world into that third
[1:29:19] pole under the opening of the seventh
[1:29:21] seal. If you get into the revealed word
[1:29:23] of the hour, whatever happens in your
[1:29:25] life, this is a a privilege for the
[1:29:27] bride. Amen. He will void everything
[1:29:32] because you are in his house. Once
[1:29:34] you're in the father's house, the word,
[1:29:38] you cannot commit adultery. Like
[1:29:40] Leviticus 20:10,
[1:29:42] you cannot accept any other headship.
[1:29:45] You cannot lie with any beast like
[1:29:47] Leviticus 20:16.
[1:29:50] That means you cannot accept any system
[1:29:52] or denomination. You are sealed away by
[1:29:55] a spirit union perfect in the likeness
[1:29:59] of God.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say it again. If you are in
[1:30:03] the father's house, if you have been
[1:30:05] united into the image of the word, you
[1:30:08] come into the likeness, in the likeness,
[1:30:11] you will not commit spiritual adultery.
[1:30:13] You will not accept any other spirit.
[1:30:15] You will not accept any other teaching.
[1:30:17] You will not accept any other man's idea
[1:30:20] or tradition. You cannot lie with any
[1:30:22] beast. Which means you will not accept
[1:30:24] any political system, no denomination,
[1:30:27] no organized religion. That is a beast.
[1:30:30] And you would not be able to be any part
[1:30:33] of that because you are in the father's
[1:30:35] house. Meaning you have come into the
[1:30:38] perfect likeness. And look saints, this
[1:30:41] was Paul's desire. Let us leave the
[1:30:44] first principles and move over into
[1:30:46] perfection.
[1:30:47] Amen. And he identified the first
[1:30:49] principles, the first principles with
[1:30:51] the unity of the flesh. Let's go past
[1:30:53] that. Let's go into the unity of the
[1:30:55] spirit. And be you therefore perfect as
[1:30:58] your father in heaven is perfect. I want
[1:31:01] to close on that just to tell you what
[1:31:04] do you think the perfection of the
[1:31:05] father is?
[1:31:07] You think the perfection of the father
[1:31:09] is about
[1:31:12] keeping your hair short, wearing long
[1:31:14] pants or for a woman wearing long hair.
[1:31:18] Is the father all about hair? Clothing.
[1:31:21] Don't do this. Don't listen to this
[1:31:23] music. Don't do this marriage. Don't get
[1:31:26] involved in that. That's not the
[1:31:27] perfection of the father. That's not the
[1:31:30] perfection of the spirit. That's the
[1:31:32] flesh. And the flesh is subject to law.
[1:31:36] Be you therefore perfect as your father
[1:31:39] in heaven is perfect. It's a completely
[1:31:42] different perfection. Amen and amen. I
[1:31:46] trust that you can see this. There's so
[1:31:48] much I've done this series in about six,
[1:31:51] seven, maybe eight parts I think. Uh so
[1:31:54] there's a lot more scriptural teaching,
[1:31:57] a lot more Bible study, a lot more
[1:31:59] reading of quotes and so on. There's so
[1:32:01] much to be able to pack into the saints
[1:32:03] which we cannot do in such limited time.
[1:32:06] But if you take the entire plan of God
[1:32:10] and see how the message of the of the
[1:32:12] prophet in this last day expressed it,
[1:32:15] reading between the lines is an an
[1:32:17] ability that's only going to come to you
[1:32:20] if you have seen the open book. If those
[1:32:23] seals have been broken away from your
[1:32:26] life. If you can now look into the word
[1:32:29] and every time you read that word, it's
[1:32:31] speaking back to you. Then you will find
[1:32:33] yourself being elevated from a tradition
[1:32:36] of the message, a tradition of living,
[1:32:39] from a religion. It becomes a harmony, a
[1:32:42] close relationship. This is not a
[1:32:44] fantasy. I will say to you, uh living
[1:32:48] what you think a visible life of not
[1:32:50] doing this, not doing that, doing this,
[1:32:52] that's a fantasy because that's making
[1:32:54] yourself feel better about something.
[1:32:57] and I'm feeling secure and those kind of
[1:33:00] natures that kind of vision is the wrong
[1:33:03] vision because that's the kind of nature
[1:33:05] where when things go bad you say well
[1:33:08] why Lord why I've been living right I've
[1:33:10] been doing this right how could you let
[1:33:12] this happen how could my mother get
[1:33:14] cancer how could my wife get cancer how
[1:33:16] could I get cancer how could such things
[1:33:18] happen but if you come into unity of the
[1:33:20] spirit you would not even ask those
[1:33:22] questions you would not even doubt you
[1:33:25] would not even care for the healing
[1:33:26] healing of the body. You would be so
[1:33:28] secure in the unity that you have with
[1:33:31] him in that spiritual realm. You're
[1:33:33] totally at peace with God. That's the
[1:33:36] vision you need to be walking in in this
[1:33:38] day. May the Lord bless you and add more
[1:33:42] to these words so that the the
[1:33:44] revelation will be expanded in your
[1:33:46] soul. May the Lord bless all of you.
[1:33:48] It's been a great privilege speaking to
[1:33:50] you. We wish you all the best for this
[1:33:53] new year. Let's bear in mind that God is
[1:33:57] not going to suddenly just lift up bring
[1:34:00] healing to this whole co thing. Let's
[1:34:02] let's remember we're not just some
[1:34:04] special people. You might be infected by
[1:34:06] it. You might get sick by it. Who knows
[1:34:08] what what might happen? But there are
[1:34:11] people out there who are not believers.
[1:34:12] There there are some who are heathens
[1:34:14] and they are being healed of of CO.
[1:34:16] There are some believers who are dying.
[1:34:18] Let's not make this co thing
[1:34:22] uh bigger than it is. It is a big thing
[1:34:24] to the world to us. We have a vision to
[1:34:27] walk in
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; and we need to focus on that. This is
[1:34:31] just another trial just like cancer and
[1:34:34] AIDS and Ebola and all of those things.
[1:34:36] It's just another trial the world has to
[1:34:38] get through. Forget about it. Do what
[1:34:40] you have to do to be safe. Listen to
[1:34:42] your governments when they tell you
[1:34:44] something, which is the scripture. um
[1:34:46] and obey what rules they give you
[1:34:48] concerning. It is it is totally uh
[1:34:52] normal and and acceptable of God. I
[1:34:54] mean, he is a God who asked them to the
[1:34:56] Israelites to wash hands in the
[1:34:58] wilderness so that they wouldn't spread
[1:34:59] disease, wash clothes in running water.
[1:35:02] This is not a foreign thing to us. So do
[1:35:05] what has to be done, but don't make it a
[1:35:07] focus. We have a different focus. Amen.
[1:35:10] We have a different life to lead. We
[1:35:12] have a different purpose to fulfill. And
[1:35:14] while the world is floundering in their
[1:35:16] mess, we can look to God. We can look to
[1:35:20] the revealed word of the hour. We can be
[1:35:22] strong in the faith. We can support the
[1:35:24] ministries. They're preaching the
[1:35:26] revealed word of the hour. We can be
[1:35:28] there together, growing together, coming
[1:35:31] into the likeness of God. And you will
[1:35:33] start to feel dominion coming back
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; to mankind again. And God is complete.
[1:35:40] Amen. The Lord bless you. Amen.
