[0:06] Amen. We'd like to greet you in the
[0:08] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:10] once again and certainly thankful to be
[0:13] back here on Wednesday nights and um
[0:17] back to work and we appreciate the time
[0:20] that God gives us to share his word. So
[0:23] without much ado because I think we have
[0:25] quite a bit to get to. I would like to
[0:29] begin and um we are going to speak on uh
[0:36] discouraged with the prophet and the
[0:39] message. That's our subject as I spoke
[0:41] to you about on the group. Um that's
[0:44] what the focus is and I'm going to
[0:47] introduce that to you. And for a title,
[0:49] it's going to be the message on trial.
[0:54] Amen. So,
[0:56] in the past months, since August last
[0:59] year, I've been questioned by young
[1:02] people who feel confused about the
[1:05] message based on things they have heard
[1:08] online or seen. And uh parents of young
[1:13] people who are just not interested in
[1:15] coming to church anymore. and some who
[1:18] have denounced the message.
[1:21] And um the concern of these parents is
[1:24] that churches dismiss those who leave as
[1:31] they are never been seed to begin with
[1:34] and are soon forgotten. While the
[1:37] parents are pining for their children
[1:39] and uh suffer in silence,
[1:42] the questions are all based on things
[1:45] they have heard or watched from material
[1:50] produced by Believe the Sign or Seek the
[1:53] Truth. And these are just the two that
[1:56] I've heard of. And um some would say
[1:59] there are other videos or testimonies or
[2:03] uh scandals that have been posted online
[2:06] that are anti- William Branom, anti-
[2:08] message, anti- message churches.
[2:12] So most young people want to know the
[2:15] truth about these accusations and um
[2:19] just some of them just want a chance to
[2:22] argue. You get those everywhere. But
[2:25] most of those that I have heard that is
[2:27] the young people um genuinely want an
[2:30] answer to remove their confusion. One of
[2:34] the main concerns of the parents was
[2:39] what answers do message ministers have
[2:42] to the accusations that are made against
[2:45] the prophet.
[2:47] So, first I want to say I haven't taken
[2:51] the time like I would like to and and I
[2:54] wish I had the time to go to the website
[2:58] of Believe the Sign or Seek You the
[3:01] Truth and and look at all the material
[3:04] that they have to put out and try to
[3:07] refute some of the things. I just
[3:10] haven't and I haven't had the time and I
[3:14] all I've done is respond to things that
[3:17] young people or people have asked me
[3:20] about what was said and um I wish I had
[3:24] the time to uh go and see what they put
[3:28] out and you know uh along with scores of
[3:31] others who have left what they call the
[3:34] message you know um and I say it that
[3:36] way because I believe that a lot of
[3:40] people who left the message, they kind
[3:43] of left churches that claim to believe
[3:46] the message uh many have left it even
[3:50] being in good churches, but their their
[3:53] perception of of the message was
[3:55] actually wrong. So really what they left
[3:58] was branomism and not really the
[4:01] message. In my experience of speaking to
[4:04] these people and it's been quite a few
[4:08] uh or quite a lot rather saying it
[4:10] correctly is that they just don't know
[4:14] the message. Right? So I can only
[4:17] respond to things that are sent to me
[4:19] because I don't spend a lot of time
[4:22] online.
[4:24] Now, I've spent years responding to
[4:28] confused young people who brought me
[4:30] questions, but I was ignorant of where
[4:34] they were getting a lot of the stuff
[4:36] from until they told me of these two
[4:39] sources. And uh one young man emailed me
[4:43] an ebook a very long time ago which I
[4:47] read through but I had no idea that a
[4:49] website was made and all these things
[4:52] were were being posted and so I only
[4:56] became aware of these things as time
[4:59] went on but still did not have the
[5:01] desire to go in there and research
[5:04] everything. Um, so
[5:07] I still don't feel the need to uh and
[5:12] fortunately for for our church, I we've
[5:16] never had someone yet, you know, be
[5:19] discouraged by these websites to the
[5:22] point of leaving the message.
[5:24] And uh so maybe that's the reason I
[5:27] haven't had that feeling to do that.
[5:31] However, some of the material that is
[5:33] sent to me like in a clip or uh an
[5:37] excerpt
[5:39] um some of the material that I read
[5:41] which was sent that came from believe
[5:44] the sign I must say I agreed with
[5:49] some of the things they said I agreed
[5:51] with because it has always been my beef
[5:54] with message people who idolize brother
[5:57] Brandham and overspiritualized
[6:00] everything to the point of losing
[6:02] important parts of just being human. And
[6:06] my church knows and people who have
[6:09] heard me preach that I am the hardest on
[6:12] message people. I don't even speak
[6:14] against denominational people or other
[6:17] religions as much as I go against people
[6:21] in the message who I feel are stepping
[6:24] out of line or you you know abusing the
[6:27] message or uh promoting brandism instead
[6:30] of promoting what the word is. So um the
[6:35] people in our church can attest to that.
[6:38] So um that's been my beef over the years
[6:42] since um I started in the ministry and I
[6:46] haven't made many friends because of
[6:48] those things. And so um I I believe that
[6:53] to the point where people obsess over
[6:56] something till they lose the feeling of
[6:59] being human to one another. And the
[7:02] important aspects of just being a normal
[7:05] person has escaped them. And there were
[7:08] others in the message who to this day
[7:11] over sensationalize
[7:13] everything to the point of defeating the
[7:16] very ends of the core of the message
[7:20] even to the point of going against
[7:22] things that the prophet even said like
[7:25] that we should not do the way we should
[7:27] act things like that. So that being
[7:31] said, I didn't grow up in a church that
[7:33] obsessed about William Brandham and uh
[7:37] that uh you know,
[7:40] we didn't disrespect and cast aside
[7:43] denominational people. I didn't grow up
[7:46] under a ministry that spewed vitriol and
[7:49] hate toward others. We grew up in a
[7:53] community at peace with religions and
[7:55] churches. I'm I'm just saying this as a
[7:57] personal thing because maybe we were
[7:59] fortunate growing up in a small country
[8:01] town where we were known by everybody
[8:04] and we uh you know we were at peace with
[8:08] everybody. We we didn't spend our time
[8:10] going around and spewing hate towards
[8:12] people. We didn't care much for online
[8:15] presence and you know things like that.
[8:18] We we we didn't feel the need to be
[8:21] unpleasant to other people and our home
[8:24] would be filled with with message
[8:26] believers and Hindus and Muslims and
[8:28] denominational Christians. So I didn't
[8:32] grow up with the things that I'm hearing
[8:35] as accusations against me people. You
[8:38] can imagine why some of it was so
[8:40] confusing. And um our pastor, my dad,
[8:44] counseledled people of all kinds and was
[8:49] basically the pastor of the community,
[8:51] never even refusing help to any person
[8:54] who wasn't even in our church. um to the
[8:58] point where
[8:59] when uh he passed away, I think if it
[9:03] were not co time
[9:06] um the majority of people who would
[9:09] would have been at his funeral would
[9:11] have been people not even in our church.
[9:15] So I'm just giving you an example of
[9:17] where I came from and the reason why I'm
[9:19] going to respond the way I am going to
[9:22] in today's segment.
[9:24] So this is why it was confusing when I
[9:27] would visit other message churches in
[9:30] our travels where the legalism was so
[9:33] off the charts where I would see them
[9:37] wrap cloth or shaws around women who
[9:40] were inappropriate inappropriately
[9:42] dressed. Uh if they came to the doors of
[9:45] the church, the deacons wouldn't allow
[9:46] them in unless they were covered up. And
[9:49] this would just chase people away and
[9:52] they would people would be denied entry
[9:54] into the church service or in other
[9:56] places where gifts of the Holy Ghost was
[10:00] so totally out of control to the point
[10:02] of creating rampant unrighteousness for
[10:06] decades. And it's because they were
[10:08] trying to emulate
[10:10] um things that occurred on the tapes in
[10:13] the prophet's life. and they shouldn't
[10:15] have been trying to do that because that
[10:17] was his ministry and not ours. So I
[10:22] don't know the people who started
[10:24] believe the sign. I don't know them
[10:25] personally or seek ye the truth. I do
[10:28] not know any of them personally
[10:31] and I don't know why they chose to do
[10:33] what they do. I can imagine that they
[10:36] must have had heated debates with people
[10:39] in the message and I have nothing
[10:41] against good debates, good, healthy,
[10:44] fair debates. So what I'm saying today
[10:46] is not against those people who made
[10:50] these websites and put these things out
[10:53] online. I'm not saying it to be against
[10:55] them or to be against any other
[10:58] ministries in the message. I'm merely
[11:00] trying to bring light to the young
[11:02] people and families who've reached out
[11:04] to me who are confused and who are
[11:07] hurting and who uh have asked for help.
[11:12] So I don't aim to convince you. I
[11:16] believe that and it's something I've
[11:18] repeated consistently to our church is
[11:21] that if you are convinced into
[11:24] something, you can be convinced out of
[11:26] it by a stronger argument or some other
[11:31] kind of attractive explanation. So I do
[11:34] not want to convince you. I aim to
[11:37] appeal to your faith by pointing out the
[11:40] truth and giving you as much of it as I
[11:43] can to help you make a better choice in
[11:46] choosing to accept or reject the
[11:49] message. Ultimately, it's going to be
[11:50] your choice. Some of the things I'm
[11:53] going to say today, you might not like,
[11:55] you might not be expecting.
[11:58] Um, and um, some of you might think,
[12:01] well, I'm citing with some of the things
[12:02] that believe the sign or uh, somebody
[12:05] whoever it is have said. I don't even
[12:07] know, right? Some of the things I've
[12:09] read, I've uh, I agree because I've seen
[12:14] things in churches where I've seen them
[12:16] misuse the message. So, which I disagree
[12:19] with. So, if they said that, I'm going
[12:21] to agree with that. but where they say
[12:23] things that you know is grossly out of
[12:26] proportion. Well, of course, I'm going
[12:28] to disagree with that. So, I want to
[12:31] begin uh by sharing a scripture. That's
[12:34] our scripture reading for today. And I'm
[12:36] going to um share with you uh the our
[12:40] first scripture.
[12:42] I hope you can see this. It is John
[12:44] 8:43.
[12:47] And it says, "Why do you not understand
[12:50] my speech even because you cannot hear
[12:55] my word?" Why do you not understand my
[12:57] speech even because? So in other words,
[13:01] the reason is because you cannot hear my
[13:04] word. Amen. So
[13:07] what does this scripture even mean?
[13:11] Right? It simply means why do you not
[13:13] understand my speech? you misinterpret
[13:16] what I am saying because you have no
[13:20] revelation of my word. So these are the
[13:22] words of Christ and he's speaking to the
[13:23] Pharisees. He's saying to them, you're
[13:26] not understanding what I am saying
[13:29] because you have no revelation of my
[13:31] word. Right? So this is such a simple
[13:35] concept because if you read the message
[13:38] and you do not have revelation of what
[13:41] is being said, you are not going to
[13:44] understand the words. You are going to
[13:46] misconstrue everything in there. And and
[13:49] that's just common sense. You can you
[13:52] can apply that to any literature in the
[13:54] world. So with that being said, I want
[13:57] to say to you and especially to young
[14:00] people, everything that you believe in
[14:04] the message in the Bible is going to be
[14:07] disproved by people. Everything you
[14:10] believe in the message is going to be
[14:11] disproved by people who fall away from
[14:13] the message. And this is the secret.
[14:18] Some of this God has allowed
[14:21] the same way he allowed Pharaoh to be
[14:25] there. He, the Bible says he ordained
[14:27] Pharaoh
[14:29] um to basically be the one to make
[14:33] things uncomfortable so that they could
[14:36] get out of Egypt because they were too
[14:38] comfortable there. Right? And the Bible
[14:40] literally says it in a way that God
[14:42] ordained Pharaoh. He raised him up for
[14:44] this purpose. And it doesn't mean that
[14:47] God made him that way, but God knew his
[14:49] character. So God allowed it to happen
[14:52] for him to persecute the elect so that
[14:55] they so that they could get out of that
[14:57] comfort zone they were in. So and
[15:01] listen, I'm not calling these people
[15:03] pharaohs. I'm just giving you an
[15:04] example. I don't mean that to be
[15:06] insulting. So the favorite starting
[15:09] point for people in the message
[15:11] obviously it's going to be the prophet
[15:14] which means you as a person have to be
[15:17] sure of the prophet. So there's our
[15:19] starting point right being sure of the
[15:22] prophet. How can you be sure of the
[15:24] prophet?
[15:26] Okay so here's some common sense
[15:29] questions.
[15:32] Did you see the miracles done by brother
[15:35] Brandham? Were you there with brother
[15:38] Brandham? Were you there when the cloud
[15:41] appeared?
[15:42] Can you prove that all things that
[15:45] brother Brandham said were true or not
[15:48] in terms of healings, miracles,
[15:51] discernment? No. You cannot prove a
[15:54] single thing. So hearing things that
[15:58] disprove the prophet's miracles, life
[16:01] stories, testimonies should not even
[16:05] hinder or affect you because signs and
[16:09] wonders are not and never have been our
[16:13] absolute.
[16:14] Okay,
[16:16] let's hold that thought. If miracles,
[16:19] signs and wonders are your absolute
[16:23] then you will be deceived by every TB
[16:25] Joshua of the world. Okay. One of the
[16:29] first claims is that brother Benham
[16:32] cannot be Malachi 4. He cannot be
[16:35] Elijah. So I've heard this. So I'm I'm
[16:38] responding to what the young people sent
[16:40] to me and what people sent to me and say
[16:42] this is what was said by these people.
[16:44] What you know, aren't they right? So,
[16:47] brother Brandham cannot be Elijah. He
[16:49] cannot be Malachi 4. That's a lie
[16:51] because Jesus said that John was Elijah.
[16:56] Is this true? Right. So, here's the
[16:59] scripture that they quote. Let's share
[17:02] that.
[17:05] Uh, this is
[17:08] Matthew 11 verse 13-4.
[17:13] And this is the Lord Jesus saying, "For
[17:15] all the prophets and the law prophesied
[17:19] until John." Now, I've I've heard some
[17:22] of them say, "Therefore, after John,
[17:25] there are no more prophets." Paul was an
[17:27] apostle. All the prophets finished up
[17:29] until John. Therefore, there are no more
[17:32] prophets. And then verse 14, Christ
[17:35] says, "And if you will receive it, this
[17:39] is Elias or Elijah." In the New
[17:43] Testament, Elijah is written as Elias.
[17:46] Right? So if you will receive it, this
[17:49] is Elias which was for to come. In other
[17:52] words, Christ is identifying John the
[17:56] Baptist as Elias. Now you have the
[17:58] scripture. What do we do with this? So
[18:00] it seems like these people are right.
[18:02] Right? The Lord Jesus seems to say that
[18:04] all the prophets were finished with
[18:06] John. He also identifies John as Elijah
[18:09] as if there was no more Elijah to come.
[18:12] Of course, we have an explanation for
[18:14] this, those of us who are in the
[18:16] message. And you cannot debate this with
[18:19] anybody who doesn't believe this unless
[18:21] you yourself are sure that the spirit of
[18:24] Elijah was upon the prophet. Okay? But
[18:28] if even if you are debating with
[18:30] somebody who doesn't believe the
[18:31] message, they're going to say to you,
[18:34] there you go. This is typical message
[18:37] brainwashing. Okay?
[18:40] So, I'm going to show you um what the
[18:43] internet says about Elijah. Okay? And
[18:48] this is this is what I'm doing for
[18:50] people, young people in the message, and
[18:52] you can also check this out for
[18:53] yourself. All right? So this is the
[18:57] internet if you Google uh what who
[19:02] claims to be Elijah and all those people
[19:04] that claims to be Elijah right so here
[19:06] are some of the names
[19:08] Mong Moon
[19:11] Herbert Armstrong Alexander Dawi Joseph
[19:15] Smith William Brham Elizabeth Nikcomia
[19:20] Louis Farrakhan or Lewis Farrakhan and
[19:23] Benny Hinn so these These are just eight
[19:26] people among many who have claimed that
[19:31] they are the Elijah or that they are the
[19:34] one prophesied to be Elijah in this last
[19:37] day. And there are many more. So you can
[19:41] research all these people yourself if
[19:43] you want to. I'm just giving you eight
[19:46] people. But I want you to ask yourself
[19:49] this question. Like I said, I'm just
[19:51] giving you uh the truth. And here is
[19:55] William Brandham's name among many other
[19:58] people in the same kind of time zone
[20:02] that he was. And people who all claimed
[20:06] to be the Elijah of the last day, right?
[20:10] But I want you to ask yourself which one
[20:12] of them, one of these people
[20:16] identified the Ahab of this day. The
[20:20] prophet identified the Ahab as
[20:22] Pentecostalism.
[20:24] Which one of them condemned and
[20:25] prophesied
[20:27] um the death of Jezebel of this day?
[20:30] That is the Roman Catholic system. Which
[20:32] one of them saw a cloud the size of a
[20:34] man's hand and prophesied that rain was
[20:36] coming? Which one of them was a
[20:39] wilderness man, uneducated, rough around
[20:42] the edges?
[20:44] And all of them, of all of them, which
[20:48] one is deemed as the greatest threat
[20:51] with the greatest amount of resistance
[20:53] against them? It's only one of them,
[20:55] right? There may be many fakes, but
[20:59] there is only one genuine ministry. Now,
[21:02] you might say, "Well, you're saying that
[21:03] because you're biased." and and probably
[21:06] yes because I believe that he was the
[21:09] Elijah or one with the Elijah ministry
[21:12] in this day. And so that's still not a
[21:16] good enough argument. So I'm not, like I
[21:18] said, I'm not trying to convince you.
[21:20] I'm just trying to say to you, what is
[21:23] an Elijah ministry supposed to do? If
[21:25] you go back to Elijah, he is the one who
[21:29] identifies Ahab. He identifies Jezebel.
[21:33] He comes at a time where there is
[21:35] drought and there is famine and he
[21:38] prophesies of the rain coming. He brings
[21:41] prophecy that is bringing judgment to
[21:44] Jezebel. Go and have a look at all these
[21:47] other so-called Elijah and see what they
[21:49] are doing and and what their ministries
[21:51] are producing. So even if you get a
[21:54] small percentage of what it is that this
[21:56] message is actually doing, if you don't,
[21:59] you're missing it, right? You're not
[22:01] seeing what the message is doing. It is
[22:03] absolutely exposing Ahab, Jezebel
[22:07] showing uh and in it all you see even an
[22:10] Elisha ministry coming up taking up the
[22:12] mantle. You also see names under that
[22:15] ministry that were not revealed to
[22:18] Elijah. Other names who were hidden
[22:22] under a seal that would be broken and uh
[22:25] who have not bowed the knee to Baal. You
[22:28] see all of this right in this particular
[22:32] ministry. So anyway, let's move on. So
[22:36] however, I would say that still won't
[22:38] prove anything to the naysayers.
[22:41] Now then you have brother Adam himself
[22:44] make some
[22:46] crazy statements, some crazy sounding
[22:49] statements. And this is one among many,
[22:52] right? which just gets people all
[22:56] knotted up and they don't know what to
[22:58] think of it. And why do they not
[23:00] understand his words, okay? Because they
[23:03] don't have revelation of his words. So
[23:06] let's go to trying to do God a service
[23:09] without it being his will. So I'm going
[23:11] to share that on the screen for you.
[23:15] Okay. Trying to do God a service. Now
[23:17] look at this quote. Paragraph 212. Now,
[23:20] he promised that. So, that sets the
[23:23] Bible just exactly to this day. And
[23:25] Sodom and Gomorrah and Elijah was not
[23:28] that wasn't Elijah. That was the spirit
[23:31] of God on Elijah. Elijah was just a man.
[23:34] Now, we've had Elijah's. So, this is
[23:39] brother saying in his day, he they've
[23:42] already had Elijah's. What he's saying
[23:45] now is you've had Elijah's. So this
[23:47] section here where he says we've had
[23:48] Elijah's he mean there have he means
[23:51] there has been there had been people who
[23:54] men and women who had claimed to be
[23:57] Elijah in his day. Then you had
[23:59] movements that were called like Elijah's
[24:02] coats and Elijah's mantels and Elijah's
[24:05] everything. That means in brother man's
[24:07] day there were people who are already
[24:10] claiming to be Elijah. But look at the
[24:11] statement. But the Elijah of this day is
[24:14] the Lord Jesus Christ. He is to come
[24:17] according to Matthew 17 or Luke 17:30
[24:20] says um the son of man is to reveal
[24:23] himself among his people not a man god.
[24:28] Okay. So, I know this. Um, I've actually
[24:32] had conversation with a young man who
[24:34] said to me, "Look, he's saying Elijah is
[24:38] the Lord Jesus Christ and then he says
[24:40] he is Elijah, therefore he's saying he
[24:43] is Jesus Christ, right?" And you can see
[24:47] how people can be confused with the way
[24:49] the prophet is. You don't blame them,
[24:51] right? And uh so basically if he's
[24:54] saying Elijah is Christ and we know
[24:57] Christ is God and if William Brandham is
[25:00] Elijah and we are all saying William
[25:01] Brandom is Elijah and now he's saying
[25:03] Elijah is Christ. Therefore we are
[25:05] saying William Brandham is God and
[25:07] everybody knows
[25:09] you know among us none of us are saying
[25:12] he's God. We don't worship him. We don't
[25:14] bow down to him. We don't pray in his
[25:16] name. So, but you have to admit these
[25:19] statements look so confusing to people
[25:22] who are reading it at face value who
[25:24] don't even understand or have any
[25:27] revelation of his words. Right? Why do
[25:30] you not understand my speech even
[25:32] because you cannot hear my word? Yet we
[25:36] know how that Moses and Elijah are Old
[25:41] Testament ministries of Christ because
[25:44] we know from Zechariah's vision the two
[25:47] olive trees standing beside the go the
[25:49] golden candlestick are Old Testament
[25:52] types of Christ. So this really doesn't
[25:56] stumble us. I'm just showing you why
[25:58] people say what they say.
[26:02] Okay, let's go to another quote here
[26:04] from
[26:05] trying to do God a service.
[26:10] Believe me, we could go through all
[26:12] these quotes in scriptures and explain
[26:14] it to you. We're going to have a service
[26:16] about each one of them and by the end of
[26:18] it, you'll be whooping and jumping and
[26:19] shouting and screaming and saying,
[26:21] "Hallelujah. Praise the Lord." But these
[26:23] are things that stumble other people who
[26:25] don't have the revelation that you and I
[26:28] have or and they would just say, "Well,
[26:31] you don't have revelation. You're just
[26:32] brainwashed." Okay. Trying to do God
[26:35] service. Paragraph 28. He says, "But
[26:37] it's so hard. It used it used to bother
[26:39] me so bad." Then I found out even our
[26:43] Lord was misunderstood in so many
[26:45] things. He'd say anything and they'd be
[26:48] misunderstood. I guess it just has to be
[26:50] that way. But those who are wise will
[26:53] understand. The Bible said so they'll
[26:56] catch it. Okay? So this is true. To
[27:01] understand all of this, you have to go
[27:02] back to the ministry of of the Lord
[27:04] Jesus Christ and John the Baptist. So
[27:07] let's see if all the things they're
[27:09] accusing William Brandom of hasn't
[27:12] happened before in the time of John and
[27:15] Christ. So that's where I want to go to
[27:17] today in today's service. I want you to
[27:20] see that everything that's being done,
[27:24] all the accusations brought against
[27:26] William Brandom, they were actually
[27:28] brought against John and Christ. John
[27:31] the Baptist and Christ. So I want you to
[27:33] go to go with me to John 1 verse 19- 24.
[27:38] And I'm going to share that on the
[27:40] screen
[27:42] for you. Okay.
[27:45] John the Baptist, right? Was he Elias or
[27:48] not?
[27:50] John 1:19:24. And this is the record of
[27:53] John when the Jews
[27:56] sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem
[27:58] to ask him, "Who art thou?" So the
[28:01] Jewish people, their their ministry of
[28:03] that day, the church of that day. Here
[28:05] comes this ruffian, you know, preaching
[28:08] in the river and uh baptizing people uh
[28:13] in God's name and asking them to come to
[28:15] repentance. and he's not working with
[28:17] the Levites. He's not working with the
[28:19] church. And so the Levites feel, hey, we
[28:22] have an obligation to go and ask him
[28:24] what's up, man. You know, who are you?
[28:26] What's going on? Whose name are you
[28:28] doing all this? And what authority do
[28:30] you have? So, who art thou? Right? Verse
[28:33] 20. And he confessed and denied not, but
[28:38] confessed, I am not the Christ. So, he
[28:40] identified himself and said, I am not
[28:43] the Christ. So John the Baptist is
[28:44] saying I am not the Messiah. Then verse
[28:47] 21, they asked him, "What then? Are you
[28:51] Elias?" In other words, are you Elijah?
[28:54] And he said, "I am not."
[28:58] And they asked, "Art thou that prophet?"
[29:01] He said, "No."
[29:04] Then said they unto him, Who art thou?
[29:07] that we may give an answer to them that
[29:09] sent us, "What sayest thou of thyself?"
[29:13] And he said, I am the voice of one
[29:15] crying in the wilderness, make straight
[29:16] the way of the Lord, as said the prophet
[29:19] Isaiah.
[29:21] They were sent, and they which were sent
[29:23] were of the Pharisees. And they asked
[29:25] him, and said unto him, Why baptize thou
[29:28] then? If you're not that Christ nor
[29:31] Elias, neither that prophet, why are you
[29:36] baptizing? What right do you have to
[29:38] this ministry? If you are not Elijah,
[29:42] you're not Messiah, you're not that
[29:44] prophet we're expecting, right? So, what
[29:47] I want to draw your attention to is
[29:51] uh during Christ's ministry, we just
[29:52] read the scripture a little way above.
[29:56] Christ said this is Elias and when John
[30:00] is asked are you Elias he said no
[30:03] okay and this is exactly what brother
[30:06] Bham also did right so during his
[30:10] ministry during Christ's ministry
[30:14] uh and this is this is important for you
[30:15] to understand Christ was rejected for
[30:19] his word right but he was widely
[30:23] acknowledged for his divine divine
[30:26] healing and discernment.
[30:28] Okay. So, we earlier confirmed that
[30:33] Christ said John the Baptist is Elijah.
[30:37] You all agree? But John the Baptist was
[30:39] not accepted as Elijah in his day. And
[30:43] we we're going to come to it now where
[30:46] people have argued about what Malachi
[30:48] 4:5 and 6 is. So, we'll get to that. So
[30:52] in his day, John the Baptist who people
[30:56] who have now left the message are
[30:58] saying, "Brother Bam lied. He's not
[31:00] Malachi 45 and 6." John the Baptist was
[31:02] in Malachi 45 and 6. And yet here is
[31:05] John in the scripture saying, "I'm not
[31:08] Elijah."
[31:09] Right? So uh who was he then? He
[31:15] identifies himself. I'm one crying in
[31:17] the wilderness, make straight the way of
[31:18] the Lord. In other words, prepare the
[31:19] way of the Messiah. His duty, he knew,
[31:22] was to set the way for Christ. He knew
[31:25] it. He had a revelation of what he was
[31:28] supposed to do. But he could not prove
[31:31] it. And he was persecuted for not being
[31:34] able to prove it. And he died for it.
[31:40] Amen. That's the truth. Okay, let's go
[31:43] to another quote, another scripture I'm
[31:45] going to share with you.
[31:49] Right. We're got to set this up before
[31:51] we get to all the meaty sections. This
[31:55] is things people made up of Christ's
[31:57] ministry. Luke chapter 9 6-9.
[32:01] And they departed and went through the
[32:03] towns and preaching the gospel and
[32:05] healing everywhere. Now Herod the
[32:08] tetrarch heard of all that was done by
[32:11] him. So Christ disciples gone and
[32:14] healing and doing great miracles
[32:16] everywhere. And Herod who was king of
[32:19] Israel at the time, the tetra, he heard
[32:21] of all these great wonders, right? And
[32:23] and this is now after Herod had beheaded
[32:26] John the Baptist. Now Herod is is
[32:30] hearing of this and he was perplexed
[32:32] because that it was said of some that
[32:35] John that is John the Baptist was risen
[32:37] from the dead. Now we know Herod's
[32:40] story. He he hated John the Baptist
[32:42] because John was like the spirit of
[32:45] Elijah
[32:46] bringing judgment to another Ahab in his
[32:51] day, right? And um then there were some
[32:54] people verse 8 says and some of them
[32:56] that Eli some said that Elias had
[32:58] appeared. Now who were they talking
[33:00] about? They were talking about Jesus
[33:01] Christ.
[33:03] There were people who had been hearing
[33:04] Jesus Christ and saying Elijah has come.
[33:08] So some of them were
[33:11] identifying Jesus as Elijah and of
[33:14] others that one of the old prophets was
[33:17] risen again. Who know like Moses or
[33:19] somebody. So in other words, there were
[33:22] people all around Christ who were
[33:25] identifying him differently. Now we know
[33:27] this because when Jesus asked the
[33:30] disciples in Matthew 16, whom do men say
[33:32] that I am? And they said some say you
[33:34] are this, some say you are that some
[33:35] say. So we know this was the condition
[33:39] of things in Christ's day. Nobody could
[33:41] identify John the Baptist. Nobody could
[33:44] identify the Lord Jesus Christ.
[33:47] And these both these men, John the
[33:49] Baptist and Christ made it extremely
[33:52] difficult for these people to even
[33:54] identify them. They just never gave
[33:56] straight answers. So it's the same thing
[33:59] here today. People would be like, "Why
[34:02] can't brother Bam just say this? Why
[34:04] can't he just say that? Why didn't he
[34:05] just say this? You just shut up all the
[34:08] naysayers. No, this is congruent with
[34:11] scriptures people. Okay. And Herod said,
[34:14] "John have I beheaded, but who is this
[34:16] of whom I hear such things?" And he
[34:19] desired to see him. Okay?
[34:23] So once again, during Christ's ministry,
[34:26] Christ was rejected for his word, but he
[34:31] was widely acknowledged for his divine
[34:33] healing and discernment. Is that right?
[34:35] What am I saying? Christ's three pools.
[34:38] First and second pool, the people loved
[34:40] him, didn't they? The people loved the
[34:42] healing. They loved the the discernment.
[34:45] They were flocking to come to him to be
[34:48] fed of the five lo and two fishes and be
[34:53] healed of leprosy and all kinds of
[34:55] things. People loved that that they were
[34:57] coming in droves and great numbers. But
[35:01] when he spoke the word, they were
[35:03] rejecting him. Right? The crowds loved
[35:06] him for the healings and the miracles
[35:08] and the discernments. And when Jesus
[35:10] began his third pull, what was his third
[35:12] pull ministry? Eat my flesh, drink my
[35:16] blood. Your fathers desired the bread
[35:19] from the wilderness which perishes. But
[35:23] this, eat my flesh, the bleeding body
[35:26] word of the son of man, and they turned
[35:28] away. Now watch what happens when he was
[35:31] drawing attention to the son of man
[35:33] ministry and said things like eat my
[35:36] flesh, drink my blood, the 70 disciples
[35:41] left him. And even the crowds who
[35:44] crossed the Sea of Galilee to come and
[35:47] ask him to feed them, they all left him
[35:51] calling him a false prophet, a false
[35:53] teacher. And when he asked the
[35:55] disciples, they didn't say, uh, you
[35:58] know, he turns to ask Peter and the
[36:00] disciples said, "Will you leave me too?"
[36:02] Watch what they said. They didn't say,
[36:04] "Uh, Lord, where are we going to go to?"
[36:07] You know, you're the one with all the
[36:08] miracles and the discernment and the and
[36:10] the the uh great testimonies. They said,
[36:13] "No, Lord, whom shall we go to? For you
[36:16] have the words of eternal life." That
[36:18] means when it comes to the third pole
[36:20] ministry, the bride of Christ is looking
[36:23] for the word, not the miracles, not the
[36:26] discernment, not the first and second
[36:28] polls. If you're looking for those
[36:30] things, you're going to have people who
[36:32] are going to copy those things, who are
[36:35] going to mess those things up, who are
[36:36] bring going to bring shame to those
[36:38] things, and right now going to disprove
[36:41] many of those miracles and discernments
[36:44] that were uh manifested in that time. So
[36:48] this shows us that the elect was always
[36:51] attracted to the word and not the first
[36:53] and second polls. Do you agree?
[36:56] All right. So now let's get to that's
[36:58] our foundation. Now we want to get to
[37:00] the accusations against the prophet. Now
[37:03] I'm going to share this uh with you.
[37:07] Um here we go. So there are basically
[37:11] four types of accusations. Uh there are
[37:15] probably hundreds. I don't even know.
[37:18] Right. If they if these people have a
[37:20] website dedicated to investigating the
[37:23] life of William Brandham, the people
[37:25] around him, his family and his friends
[37:28] and I can imagine there must be
[37:32] thousands of things. But there are four
[37:34] types of accusations that I want to
[37:36] focus on because these are the things
[37:37] that have been brought to me. Okay, so
[37:40] these are the types of accusations.
[37:42] Number one, William Brham is accused of
[37:44] having homosexuals working for him and
[37:48] uh also among that like um immoral
[37:53] people. Number two, there are a whole
[37:56] lot of failed prophecies and thus sayeth
[37:59] the Lord's and stories that he told with
[38:03] no proof or that they were inconsistent
[38:07] or something like that. Number three,
[38:09] brother Brandham or William Brandham was
[38:11] proven false because of the number of
[38:14] failed men in this message.
[38:17] And number four, of course, the
[38:19] favorite, the cloud of 1963.
[38:22] Okay,
[38:24] now let's talk about it. Let's go to um
[38:29] uh and explain what this really is. And
[38:32] I'm going to go through each accusation
[38:35] uh each type of accusation. All right.
[38:37] So
[38:39] all the accusers of William Brham that I
[38:42] have come across and who have spoken to
[38:45] me personally that's what I'm addressing
[38:47] right who were inspired by and they by
[38:51] their own admission
[38:54] believe the sign seek ye the truth
[38:57] and they claim that. So here's what they
[39:00] claim because now like I asked them like
[39:03] some of them are like friends and I'm
[39:04] saying to them listen it's okay if you
[39:07] don't believe you know what I I'm still
[39:10] your brother I you're my brother I will
[39:13] hug you I'll meet you I'll greet you
[39:15] I'll I'll have coffee with you and we
[39:18] can have dinner together. I don't care
[39:20] because I can do that with anybody. I am
[39:23] I'm not afraid of you. You shouldn't be
[39:24] afraid of me. We shouldn't have any bad
[39:26] blood. you leaving the message. It's
[39:28] okay, you know, but why the hate? Why
[39:32] the attack? You know, I'm giving you
[39:35] love. Why do you need to attack me or
[39:38] somebody? I I just don't get this, you
[39:39] know. So, um, they claim their
[39:43] responsibility
[39:45] is to expose a false prophet and get the
[39:49] people back to believing only the Bible
[39:52] and Christ. Okay? I've literally heard
[39:55] these words that that's what they're
[39:57] doing. So I like I have like human
[40:00] conversation with them and I'm saying
[40:02] listen just leave it. Just go and live
[40:06] your life. Go find a better church that
[40:09] you feel is a better fit for you. Go
[40:12] dress how you want to do what you want.
[40:15] Just find happiness. You know, just
[40:17] leave this obsession alone and it's not
[40:21] worth it. just go enjoy yourself, right?
[40:24] Go and and be who you want to be. Forget
[40:27] about the people. No, no. They zero in.
[40:30] They focus. They make it an obsession
[40:33] because they feel it's their
[40:35] responsibility
[40:37] to expose a false prophet and get the
[40:40] people back to believing the Bible and
[40:42] Christ.
[40:44] So, in speaking with them, what I found
[40:46] was a massive gap of ignorance. Okay. uh
[40:51] indoctrination definitely from the sites
[40:53] because when I would speak to them I
[40:55] would hear exactly the same thing that I
[40:58] heard from another person like almost
[41:00] word for word like and the same
[41:02] arguments and I hear from this guy and
[41:04] the same thing from that guy and they're
[41:06] quoting the exact same thing as if they
[41:08] read it somewhere. Now I know this
[41:10] because I hear the same thing when I
[41:11] speak to 7day Adventist or Jehovah's
[41:13] Witness or and I can just hear
[41:15] indoctrination and they'll spew back
[41:18] exactly the same things. So when they do
[41:20] that, I just know exactly where to go to
[41:22] it. It's so easy, right? So why I say um
[41:26] uh ignorance and obsession
[41:29] and then I realized that
[41:32] uh with with a lot of them, I would say
[41:34] most of them. Now remember this is not
[41:36] the people who created the sites and
[41:39] people who started these things. I'm
[41:40] talking about people influenced by them.
[41:43] people some of them who are friends who
[41:45] are people I knew in the message for
[41:46] many years
[41:48] and uh what I found is that many of them
[41:52] are have this obsession because they are
[41:54] fueled by hurt they've been hurt by
[41:59] people in the message by pastors in the
[42:01] message by churches they've been many of
[42:05] them I would say I I would even agree
[42:07] were unfairly treated they could have
[42:10] been treated in a better way And I don't
[42:13] think it's the message that did that
[42:14] because I from everything I know of
[42:16] brother Brandham I've never seen him
[42:18] treat people that way. I you know when I
[42:21] say seen I I hear in in the messages how
[42:25] he treats people how he speaks to them
[42:27] and the respect that he has. So
[42:30] obviously there are people in the
[42:32] message, ministers, church people or
[42:34] whatever and they go and do stuff with
[42:37] people that and hurt them and and and
[42:40] who are um not cognizant of people's
[42:44] feelings when they speak to them. Right?
[42:46] So when it comes to hurt and pride,
[42:49] there is much to be said. I could tell
[42:51] you individual cases I know of, but the
[42:54] truth is people are very often
[42:57] mishandled by message churches and
[42:59] unjustly treated by pastors. This is why
[43:01] I'm saying when I hear some things
[43:04] spoken of by uh believe the sign or
[43:07] something, I agree with it. When they
[43:09] say some, you know, there's cultish
[43:11] behavior, I agree. There are definitely
[43:14] some churches who are without a doubt
[43:17] just cults. cult in their actions. Cult
[43:20] in the way they teach teach their people
[43:22] control their people. They control their
[43:24] people to the point of you can't paint
[43:26] your house a different color unless you
[43:28] consult with the pastor first. It's
[43:30] ridiculous. You can't buy a car without
[43:33] asking him which car to buy. You can't
[43:36] handle your own finances without him
[43:38] advising you how to handle your
[43:39] finances.
[43:41] You know, I don't have the time for
[43:43] things like that. Just go paint your
[43:44] house whatever color you want. Choose
[43:46] whatever car you want to waste your
[43:49] money the way you want to. I'm going to
[43:51] be happy for you because it's your
[43:52] choice. If you want my advice, I ask
[43:55] you. But I'm telling you, I've seen
[43:58] churches where this is done and it's
[44:00] just craziness. So, I agree with them.
[44:03] These people are often these hurt people
[44:05] who were left the message were often
[44:08] demonized by church members. They were
[44:10] shamed publicly or they were, you know,
[44:13] they were excommunicated and they used
[44:16] the the the saying treat them as
[44:18] heathens and publicans and then it means
[44:20] like you cannot even speak to them.
[44:22] Don't pray for them. Don't talk to them.
[44:25] If you meet them on the street, walk the
[44:26] other way. And this is not the Bible
[44:29] because you don't treat heathens and
[44:31] publicans that way. Heathens and
[44:33] publicans you meet at the mall, you say,
[44:35] "Hey, good morning. How you doing?" you
[44:37] know, and how and nice weather today and
[44:40] how's your child? You know, we spoke
[44:42] about that a lot. That's how you treat
[44:43] heathens and publicans. But now when you
[44:46] meet someone who is excommunicated, you
[44:48] treat them like vermin or like they have
[44:50] leprosy because you handed them over to
[44:52] the devil. I don't understand those
[44:55] things. So, and I agree. When people are
[44:58] treated that way, it's just plain out
[45:00] wrong. To the best of my knowledge,
[45:02] these things are inspired by culture and
[45:06] a desire that men have to control other
[45:09] people because they are building up
[45:11] their own ministries. That is not the
[45:14] message. Okay? There is also a lot of
[45:17] elitism in the message. Even in using
[45:20] the term of the term the bride of
[45:22] Christ,
[45:24] when you use the term the bride of
[45:25] Christ, it should be spoken with
[45:27] humility. And often times it's spoken
[45:30] without humility as if we are elite
[45:33] people that just deserve to sit around
[45:35] in our chairs, you know, waiting to be
[45:38] served. Listen saints, though we are the
[45:41] bride of Christ, we are servants of
[45:42] Christ. We should not have the mindset
[45:45] of being uh, you know, judges who walk
[45:48] around condemning everybody. Rather, you
[45:50] should have the mindset of being saviors
[45:52] who judge with truth and honor, not
[45:55] being people who preach condemnation
[45:58] upon everyone and nothing upon
[46:00] ourselves. That is not the message. That
[46:03] is not the way the prophet preached and
[46:05] not congruent with the spirit of Christ.
[46:07] This is the truth. However, I must say
[46:10] on behalf of the church, I will say
[46:13] there are there are scores of honest,
[46:16] good intentioned, good intentioned
[46:19] message people who just want to protect
[46:21] their children or the church from
[46:25] unrighteous miscreants. Let's face it,
[46:27] in some churches we just get misreants.
[46:30] We get people who just want to come
[46:32] there for a free ride. You know, they
[46:35] and you know, any church has these
[46:37] elements in them. They just dare to they
[46:40] want money from you. They want to mess
[46:42] around and they want you to to forgive
[46:45] them for everything that they're up and
[46:46] down, up and down. And of course, there
[46:48] are these people who are taking
[46:50] advantage of our good graces.
[46:53] I'm not talking about those people.
[46:55] Those people are at their core
[46:57] rebellious people. but through making
[47:00] oppressive rules and judging unfairly
[47:04] and swiping everybody with a broad
[47:07] brush. This is the truth that many a
[47:11] goodhearted sincere backslider has been
[47:14] severely injured by church tradition.
[47:17] Let's just say it as it is. Coming back
[47:21] to those who have left the message, I
[47:24] mentioned ignorance because remember in
[47:27] the beginning when I said I saw a
[47:30] massive gap of this ignorance because
[47:33] they just read what they get on believe
[47:36] the sign, seek you the truth, whatever
[47:38] it is, whatever they watched or or read,
[47:41] they just look at that and they are
[47:45] influenced by it and they themselves
[47:48] don't go and read the message, the
[47:52] context of things the prophet said. They
[47:54] don't even see the theme of the message.
[47:57] They don't even see they don't even go
[47:59] back and read church history for
[48:02] themselves. And a result of reading one
[48:05] antibrandom website and not properly
[48:08] studying history and especially church
[48:11] history and all the accusations made
[48:14] against William Brham. What they don't
[48:16] realize when they are doing what they're
[48:19] doing is almost every single accusation
[48:24] made against William Brham are
[48:26] accusations that have been brought
[48:30] against Christ, John the Baptist and the
[48:33] disciples or the apostles and the
[48:36] disciples and apostles were killed,
[48:38] beheaded,
[48:39] martyed, right? And even later to this
[48:43] day there are atheists, agnostics, there
[48:46] are all kinds of people who bring
[48:48] accusations against Christ, John the
[48:51] Baptist and the apostles. Right?
[48:54] Because there are accusations made
[48:57] against the Bible, against Jesus Christ,
[48:59] against the apostles, does it mean that
[49:02] because there are scores of
[49:04] anti-Christian, anti-religion
[49:07] historians, scientists, researchers who
[49:10] who have published proofs who have
[49:14] brought historical documents, witness
[49:16] statements to state their claims against
[49:19] the Bible, against those who compile the
[49:23] Bible.
[49:23] against many of the people in church
[49:26] history. Does it mean the Bible is
[49:28] false? Does it mean Christ is false?
[49:31] Does it mean John the Baptist and the
[49:33] disciples were frauds just because these
[49:36] accusations were made against them and
[49:38] were brought with proofs
[49:42] because this is what's been done to the
[49:43] prophet. Right? Remember, I'm not
[49:46] convincing you. I'm asking you to see
[49:48] the truth.
[49:50] According to the standards that these
[49:52] people who are accusing the brother
[49:55] Benham according to the standards they
[49:58] use to judge the prophet. If the same
[50:01] standard is used to judge Christ then
[50:04] Christ would be false. Then John the
[50:07] Baptist would be false. Then the
[50:08] disciples would be false. Then the
[50:10] entire New Testament would be false.
[50:12] There would be inconsistencies.
[50:14] There'd be discrepancies. There'd be
[50:17] things Paul said that doesn't agree with
[50:19] James. There'd be things here that is
[50:21] said that doesn't agree with that. Go
[50:23] search the internet. You will find
[50:25] websites upon websites of discrepancies
[50:29] in the Bible. These things have already
[50:31] been done over 2,000 years to discredit
[50:35] Jesus Christ and the disciples. So,
[50:39] here's what's probably going to happen.
[50:41] A lot of these people who leave the
[50:42] message are eventually going to leave
[50:45] Christ altogether. I'm saying this
[50:48] because I've already seen it happen.
[50:50] Okay? They just eventually give up
[50:53] completely on um being a believer in God
[50:57] altogether.
[50:59] So
[51:01] yet these message haters, what they
[51:03] don't see about how foolish they look by
[51:08] claiming to defend the Bible from the
[51:11] message when the Bible has already been
[51:15] viferously
[51:16] disgraced by many historians and
[51:19] ex-Christians. In fact, you'll find
[51:22] places where you you might find people
[51:25] why I left Christianity. So when you get
[51:29] YouTube videos why I left the message
[51:32] for every one of those there are another
[51:34] 10 or 100 why I left Christianity what
[51:37] does that prove right in fact the
[51:39] message doesn't even attempt to
[51:42] circumvent the Bible we are the message
[51:45] people are not trying to get people not
[51:47] to believe the Bible but there are
[51:50] people on YouTube and other places
[51:52] trying to get people not to believe the
[51:54] Bible message people actually want to
[51:58] make people Christians. Message people
[52:00] actually want to make people believe in
[52:02] in the Lord Jesus Christ and salvation
[52:04] for sins. We are not even trying to
[52:06] circumvent the Bible. And yet we have
[52:09] people who leave the message trying to
[52:11] make us look like we are trying to take
[52:15] things away from Christ and make William
[52:18] Brandon more important. They've missed
[52:19] the boat. That's the truth. In fact, um
[52:23] the message, you know, one of the most
[52:25] surprising things is the Bible was
[52:28] actually protected by the Catholic
[52:30] Church through all the politics and
[52:32] violence and for all that they said
[52:34] against the Catholic Church, they were
[52:36] one of the one of the denominations that
[52:38] really protected the Bible. Okay, so
[52:41] let's get to the first accusation.
[52:45] All right, the first accusation. And now
[52:47] the these are the things I mentioned on
[52:49] the on the group where I said they're
[52:52] maybe inappropriate for your younger
[52:54] teenagers or who haven't heard these
[52:56] things. And I'm going to mention some
[52:58] names here because these are mentioned.
[53:00] It's it's become public knowledge.
[53:02] So there's this accusation that these
[53:07] two men who are mentioned in the
[53:08] message, brother Gene and brother Lee,
[53:11] that brother Brandham called them his in
[53:13] in inverted commas his tape boys. And
[53:16] there's a lot being said. There's
[53:17] there's like insinuations made because
[53:20] he mentioned those words. Uh they say he
[53:23] created this recording studio called the
[53:26] park. I know I don't know. I haven't
[53:28] read it myself. I'm just telling what's
[53:29] being told to me. In which there's
[53:32] apparently many unlawful documented
[53:36] sexual acts were committed. I have no
[53:39] knowledge of this to whether this is
[53:41] true. So, were these men homosexuals at
[53:45] the time when they worked with brother
[53:46] Bam? I don't know. Did the prophet know
[53:48] this? I don't know. Was he meant to know
[53:51] this? Who knows? Apparently, brother Lee
[53:56] Vale, who brother Maram said was a
[53:58] teacher of the message, made these
[54:00] statements as a fact. In other words, he
[54:03] said them that they were a fact. There's
[54:06] a message he preached on the 1st of July
[54:09] 2000.
[54:11] It was Godhead part 11 by brother Levale
[54:15] where he made these statements and
[54:16] apparently he also said that one of
[54:19] brother Brandham's managers K ferry von
[54:21] Bloomberg was also gay. Uh he said
[54:24] another manager brother Ernie Baxter was
[54:26] a womanizer and even got drunk on
[54:29] brother Brandham's India trip.
[54:31] So we who claim to be in the message, we
[54:36] have people in the message who claim to
[54:38] be in the message releasing these
[54:40] statements to the world of William
[54:44] Brandham haters. So bear in mind these
[54:47] accusations came up after brother
[54:50] Brandham is gone to discredit
[54:54] either those people or his ministry.
[54:59] like why did these people not bring it
[55:01] up in the day when they were with
[55:02] brother Brandham right okay so these
[55:07] accusations are made about the prophet I
[55:09] have no way of checking this or knowing
[55:12] this even the accusers have no way
[55:15] because these people are all dead and
[55:17] gone there's no way to even know how
[55:19] much of credence there is to it let's
[55:22] take this to the time of Christ okay so
[55:24] this is what I want to show young people
[55:25] if you're saying oh my goodness how good
[55:27] brother man these people and whatever.
[55:29] Okay, here's the accusations against
[55:31] Christ.
[55:33] I have read excerpts and books of
[55:35] writers from I've been in this message
[55:37] all my life. I read books. You see
[55:39] behind me, these are books. I read
[55:41] books. I don't spend my time online. And
[55:45] so, by the way, so I try to even check
[55:47] for some of the books that I've read in
[55:48] the past. I cannot even find them. I I
[55:51] try to do this even with AI as the
[55:53] little knowledge that I have. and and
[55:55] basically the AI is telling me the
[55:57] things I am saying are anti-Semitic
[55:59] because I'm trying to look for
[56:01] accusation the Jews made against uh
[56:04] Christ and my goodness I I don't even
[56:06] think that AI would say I'm
[56:08] anti-Semitic. So, but that's what it is.
[56:11] So, some of the material and the books
[56:13] that I know I've read I've picked them
[56:15] up from shelves in the past. They don't
[56:18] even want to put them online anymore.
[56:20] So, they used to be online. And I
[56:22] remember 2014 2015 they were online and
[56:25] there were excerpts from but it's like
[56:27] you can't even find them anymore. But
[56:29] anyway, I've read uh excerpts and and
[56:32] and books of writers who say that some
[56:34] of the Jews during that time claimed
[56:36] that and accused John the Baptist and
[56:39] Jesus Christ of being homosexuals
[56:41] themselves especially because they
[56:44] didn't take wives and uh they didn't
[56:47] claim to be unics because if you didn't
[56:50] take a wife it was acceptable in society
[56:53] but you had to claim to be a unic you
[56:56] have to prove yourself to be a unic And
[56:58] so they didn't like the fact that Jesus
[57:01] Christ and because look all the priests
[57:03] had wives and they had children to show
[57:07] that they were not weird, right? And so
[57:09] here's John the Baptist and Christ not
[57:11] taking wives. And then some of them
[57:13] accused uh or or them after they had
[57:16] already died to discredit their ministry
[57:20] because in Jewish society homosexuality
[57:22] was taboo. Uh Jesus was disrespected for
[57:27] claiming to be a rabbi and letting a
[57:29] prostitute woman touch his feet. My
[57:32] point is if you're saying why did
[57:34] brother Bam HAVE ALL THESE PEOPLE, WHY
[57:36] DID Christ let a prostitute woman touch
[57:38] his feet? Right? Why did he go and speak
[57:41] to a prostitute woman in the street when
[57:42] it was against the law at that time? Why
[57:45] did he have uh or sit with the publicans
[57:47] and the wine bibbers? Why did he have
[57:50] all these discredited,
[57:52] unworthy people around him all the time?
[57:56] Like to me, this argument is is really
[57:59] very stupid. Right? So there's a a very
[58:03] odd scripture um uh which really kind of
[58:07] lacks context in Mark 14:51- 52 when
[58:12] they were coming to arrest Christ. It
[58:15] says a young man who followed Jesus and
[58:17] the disciples and that he was always
[58:20] like naked and he just wrapped a cloth
[58:22] around himself to cover his nakedness
[58:26] and that when they came to arrest Jesus
[58:28] and they tried to grab this young man
[58:30] thinking he was part of this party that
[58:33] he just dropped his robe and ran off
[58:36] naked.
[58:38] Right. And um the the excerpts I read
[58:41] suggested that he might have been
[58:43] homosexual. This is why he set apart
[58:46] from uh the group because he was
[58:49] homosexual and the words were he was a
[58:53] soft boy or in the Greek an epheminate
[58:57] which in that time meant he was
[58:59] homosexual right and that is the reason
[59:02] why he didn't sit among the group
[59:03] because he sat away but he was really
[59:06] interested in what u Jesus was saying
[59:10] and he was attracted to the words of
[59:12] Christ and so there was accusations now
[59:14] brought to Christ. Look, you have
[59:16] someone following you who's a soft boy.
[59:18] He's homosexual.
[59:21] Um, so I've read a book called The Bible
[59:25] Fraud many years ago in which Europeans
[59:29] say that Jesus had an affair with Mary
[59:32] Magdalene and he had children through
[59:35] her, right? And that's why he loved her.
[59:38] Um, there's also accusations made to
[59:41] say, you know, well, Jesus uh loved John
[59:46] and John lay on his breast and therefore
[59:48] there's that there was some hint of
[59:51] homosexual behavior there. These are
[59:53] actually things that were said against
[59:56] Christ. I'm saying to you things that
[59:58] are brought against William Brham,
[1:00:00] they're not new. They were they were
[1:00:01] things that were brought against Christ,
[1:00:03] John the Baptist and the disciples.
[1:00:06] There in this book, the Bible fraud,
[1:00:09] the kings of England, France, and Italy,
[1:00:12] and even Germany claimed to be in the
[1:00:14] lineage of Christ. And this book claims
[1:00:17] that Jesus Christ and his mother Mary
[1:00:21] were of some kind of royal line and they
[1:00:24] could trace it back to the Celtic
[1:00:27] royal bloodline.
[1:00:29] And this is actually written materials.
[1:00:33] I read this book. I've seen the
[1:00:34] excerpts. I've seen the detail on the
[1:00:37] research and uh pottery and paintings
[1:00:41] and carvings and all kinds of things of
[1:00:44] proof that they have that Jesus Christ
[1:00:46] was not who he said he was and he was
[1:00:48] actually there was actually another
[1:00:50] story behind it.
[1:00:52] So in this modern age, the common
[1:00:55] argument that you are going to see, you
[1:00:56] young people today are going to see
[1:00:58] online is if homosexuality is wrong,
[1:01:01] then why didn't Jesus Christ come out
[1:01:04] and condemn it outright? There isn't a
[1:01:06] single scripture where he says he speaks
[1:01:08] against homosexuality. In fact,
[1:01:11] Christian LGBTQ advocates claim that
[1:01:15] Jesus Christ may actually have been
[1:01:18] queer because he chose not to marry and
[1:01:22] because it was not acceptable in that
[1:01:24] time uh uh because he was queer. So, he
[1:01:28] just chose not to to be married. And now
[1:01:31] they also accuse people who say that
[1:01:33] Christ might have been married because
[1:01:36] of their arguments to try and normalize
[1:01:38] Christ.
[1:01:40] Is there truth to any of these things?
[1:01:44] Listen, this is like basically bashing
[1:01:46] Christianity. If you're going to go this
[1:01:48] far to accept accusations like that,
[1:01:51] baseless, stupid accusations against the
[1:01:54] prophet and against men who were around
[1:01:56] the prophet, well, there's a lot to go
[1:01:59] around. There's a lot of accusations
[1:02:02] made against Jesus Christ, the
[1:02:03] disciples, John the Baptist. Go read the
[1:02:06] history. It's already been done. What's
[1:02:08] being done now is stale news. Okay?
[1:02:11] That's what I'm telling you. Um, in that
[1:02:14] time of Christ, was their sexuality of
[1:02:18] society like that in the time of Christ?
[1:02:20] It was terrible because Christ lived in
[1:02:23] what was called the Greco Roman period
[1:02:26] or under their influence. And we know
[1:02:29] that the Bible tells us that Jesus, the
[1:02:31] Bible tells us Jesus was tempted on all
[1:02:35] points as a man. So for certain there
[1:02:38] must have been those around him that
[1:02:39] could have been questionable. There must
[1:02:41] have been women who tried to proposition
[1:02:45] Jesus Christ. There might have been men
[1:02:47] who who tried to proposition Jesus
[1:02:49] Christ. There might have been people who
[1:02:52] watched him talk to a woman or talk to a
[1:02:55] woman who was trying to flirt with him
[1:02:57] or a man who was trying to flirt with
[1:02:59] him. This was Greco Roman society at the
[1:03:02] time. There must have been many stories
[1:03:04] going around. Why is he he's 30 years
[1:03:06] old. He's in his father's house. Why is
[1:03:08] he not getting married? There must have
[1:03:10] been many things that went on. Does that
[1:03:13] prove that Jesus word was wrong? That's
[1:03:17] your choice.
[1:03:19] The Bible doesn't even give any of these
[1:03:21] details. What is your response to these
[1:03:24] people who leave the message, who bring
[1:03:26] these accusations?
[1:03:28] That's not in the Bible. So, we don't
[1:03:30] accept it. All right? Is that is that
[1:03:33] your is that is that the response?
[1:03:36] That's not in the Bible. So we So what
[1:03:38] what happens is and I've done this when
[1:03:40] I tell this to those people who have
[1:03:43] left the message. It's like you're doing
[1:03:46] this to Jesus Christ. You're comparing
[1:03:48] you're comparing uh you're comparing our
[1:03:51] Christ to William Brandham. You're
[1:03:53] trying to make what? I'm not even doing
[1:03:55] that. Stop making stupid comparisons.
[1:03:58] I'm not even doing that. I'm just saying
[1:04:00] to you the same accusations you bring
[1:04:02] against William Brandom have been
[1:04:03] brought against Christ. So how do you
[1:04:05] refute that? Look at these documents.
[1:04:07] Look at these excerpts. Look at what's
[1:04:08] been said. And then you watch them. They
[1:04:11] will tell us now if you try to defend
[1:04:13] William Brandham and you use certain
[1:04:15] things in certain ways and certain
[1:04:17] phrases, you start to see them trying to
[1:04:20] defend Christ in exactly the same way.
[1:04:23] It's just hypocrisy. Right? So I don't
[1:04:27] get the point of this argument. whether
[1:04:28] the prophet had people around him who
[1:04:31] have strange or questionable sexual
[1:04:33] orientation. To me, it's a very stupid
[1:04:36] argument. It does not at all discredit
[1:04:38] the word that was preached.
[1:04:42] I would expect that brother Baram could
[1:04:44] have had
[1:04:45] many questionable people around him, all
[1:04:49] kinds of people in churches and he might
[1:04:52] have himself made very questionable
[1:04:55] decisions about marriages, about people
[1:04:58] because they that would be congruent
[1:05:00] with all the prophets in the Bible. They
[1:05:03] were not meant to do anything else but
[1:05:06] be vessels to deliver God's word. Go
[1:05:09] back and check the Bible. The greatest
[1:05:12] problems to the prophet Samuel were his
[1:05:14] own sons,
[1:05:16] their own family. People are Does that
[1:05:18] discredit Samuel? Does that discredit
[1:05:20] who he was, his person or the word that
[1:05:23] he brought? No, it doesn't. Right? So to
[1:05:26] me, when you bring those accusations,
[1:05:28] that's a little bit immature. Right? Be
[1:05:31] be better.
[1:05:33] Okay. The second accusation is failed
[1:05:37] prophecies and thus said the Lord's
[1:05:40] stories with no proof. Okay.
[1:05:43] anti-brandom researchers will not stop
[1:05:45] spending time seeking our prophecies of
[1:05:47] brother Brandham to I mean there's
[1:05:49] there's probably tens of hundreds I
[1:05:53] don't know in the message if you could
[1:05:55] go through it scrutinize each thing
[1:05:57] because you had the ability because
[1:05:59] voice of God recordings put it out there
[1:06:01] so you have a treasure trove of places
[1:06:05] to go and research and find fault with
[1:06:07] everything you can't do that with Paul
[1:06:09] you can't do that with any other
[1:06:10] minister because nobody else in the
[1:06:12] history of the Bible has had his work
[1:06:15] over decades, two or three decades
[1:06:19] uh recorded in both audio and word for
[1:06:23] you to scrutinize. Not even Jesus
[1:06:25] Christ, not even every sermon Jesus
[1:06:28] Christ preached. Do you have in tape and
[1:06:31] book form to scrutinize and check? Was
[1:06:33] there discrepancy here? Was there
[1:06:35] discrepancy there? Did he say this this
[1:06:36] way? There did he say the same story
[1:06:38] there? this way. You don't have this
[1:06:40] with anybody else in the history of the
[1:06:43] church, but you have this with this
[1:06:45] humble Kentucky and he's like, you know,
[1:06:49] he's like got hooks on him with bait and
[1:06:51] there you go. Cob boy seek. That's
[1:06:55] what's happening. So, uh, another is
[1:06:59] brother Billy Paul's testimony of what
[1:07:01] brother Baron said about shark swimming
[1:07:03] where he's standing before he was an old
[1:07:05] man. When brother Billy Paul died, I had
[1:07:08] people reaching out to me. Brother
[1:07:09] Alice, is the rapture going to take
[1:07:11] place now? Like what's going to happen?
[1:07:13] And you know, uh, was brother Benham
[1:07:15] false here? I just want to say this with
[1:07:18] due respect to brother Billy Paul. That
[1:07:20] account is not in the message. It's not
[1:07:23] anywhere in the books or in the tapes
[1:07:25] what brother Benham said to brother
[1:07:26] Billy Paul. It's brother Billy Paul's
[1:07:28] testimony, his own personal testimony.
[1:07:31] And with due respect to him, when we
[1:07:33] know how the prophet speaks, we just
[1:07:36] don't know what God showed the prophet
[1:07:38] and what context it was when he spoke
[1:07:41] about that. We just don't know it. And
[1:07:43] we cannot even place any faith in it
[1:07:46] because it wasn't told to us. It was
[1:07:48] told to him. Who knows why it was told
[1:07:51] to him like it had to give him incentive
[1:07:54] to do something in his life. It was for
[1:07:56] him. It was not for us. It was not for
[1:07:59] you and I to say, "Oh, California is
[1:08:02] going to sink before brother Billy Paul
[1:08:03] dies." No, it didn't say that, right?
[1:08:07] So, that's just simply the truth.
[1:08:09] Claimed healings of people who were sick
[1:08:11] and died after brother Maramon
[1:08:13] proclaimed them healed. We don't know
[1:08:15] any of this. We can't we can't uh
[1:08:18] corroborate. We don't have any evidence.
[1:08:20] We can't go and say, "Well, of course,
[1:08:22] they were healed because brother Madam
[1:08:24] said so." Listen, those people could
[1:08:27] have taken it back. Those people could
[1:08:29] could have told brother Brandham, "Thank
[1:08:30] you, brother Brandon. We were healed. 20
[1:08:32] days later, they were not healed and
[1:08:34] they feel dejected." And he told so many
[1:08:37] of them, "Go believing. Your faith makes
[1:08:40] you whole." You know, just like how
[1:08:42] Christ told the people. And when he
[1:08:45] preached demonology, he says, "The same
[1:08:47] faith that took it away. If you if you
[1:08:49] disbelieve, unbelief brings it back
[1:08:52] again." Listen, I'm not even going to
[1:08:56] defend that. Defend him there. So,
[1:08:59] historians and atheists did the same
[1:09:02] things to Christ. Where I'm going to ask
[1:09:05] you now, where are the proofs of the
[1:09:08] healings that Christ did?
[1:09:11] Where is the proof, the empirical proof
[1:09:14] of feeding 5,000
[1:09:16] with two loaves and five fishes?
[1:09:19] where all we have is the disciples word
[1:09:22] that was written and passed down through
[1:09:24] generations. If you apply the same
[1:09:27] standard you are criticizing William
[1:09:29] Brandham with then you must apply the
[1:09:31] same standard with the Lord Jesus
[1:09:32] Christ. Why must you have total faith in
[1:09:35] what Jesus Christ and the Bible says and
[1:09:37] you cannot have faith in these things
[1:09:39] that the prophet has said. What's the
[1:09:41] difference? You have the ability in this
[1:09:44] time to go back and interview people and
[1:09:47] check this and check this. But you
[1:09:49] cannot do that with Christ. Which is
[1:09:51] what happens when you speak to atheists,
[1:09:52] they ask you where's the proof? And you
[1:09:55] have no proof. So these same people
[1:09:57] leaving the message. When atheists and
[1:09:59] other people ask you, "Where's the proof
[1:10:00] of Jesus Christ?" You can't answer.
[1:10:04] You're being a hypocrite. You can't
[1:10:06] answer. And you saying, "Well, we
[1:10:08] believe it by faith." You've got to have
[1:10:10] faith. So I have faith in the message of
[1:10:13] the prophet, and I don't need to prove
[1:10:16] anything to anybody.
[1:10:18] That's the truth. So, there were
[1:10:22] reliable historians. Here's the thing.
[1:10:24] There were reliable historians in the
[1:10:26] time of Christ like Josephus and
[1:10:28] Tacitus, the Roman historian. Why aren't
[1:10:31] their accounts in the writings of
[1:10:35] Josephus and Tacitus
[1:10:38] uh about all the miracles and the
[1:10:40] healings that Christ did?
[1:10:42] Why do they not corroborate what is
[1:10:44] written in the Gospels? Shouldn't there
[1:10:47] have been historians around uh
[1:10:50] corroborating all the evidence if it
[1:10:52] made such a big stir? Right? Whose word
[1:10:56] should we believe? Should we believe the
[1:10:58] historians or should we believe the
[1:11:00] disciples who were devoted to Christ and
[1:11:02] who could possibly have made up
[1:11:03] everything? Because this is what they're
[1:11:05] saying we did with William Brandom. Here
[1:11:08] is one of the favorites, right?
[1:11:11] According to them,
[1:11:13] none of the prophecies in Matthew 24
[1:11:16] have come to pass. It's been 2,000
[1:11:18] years. Right? Let me show you the
[1:11:21] accusation made against Christ.
[1:11:24] All right, let's share this.
[1:11:28] It's phenomenal, people.
[1:11:31] All right. I still hear Christians and
[1:11:34] message be people struggle with this
[1:11:36] today. Matthew 24:34,
[1:11:39] "Verily I say unto you, this generation
[1:11:43] shall not pass till all these things be
[1:11:47] fulfilled. Heaven and earth shall pass
[1:11:50] away, but my words shall not pass away."
[1:11:53] When the Bible says that heaven and
[1:11:55] earth shall pass away, but my word shall
[1:11:57] not pass away, he means that everything
[1:11:59] I told you is 100% the truth, right? So,
[1:12:03] we all know Matthew 24, right, from the
[1:12:05] beginning. false Christ shall arise and
[1:12:07] shall deceive many and so on and so on.
[1:12:09] There's going to be the abomination and
[1:12:11] make it desolation and all the there's
[1:12:13] beams famines and wars and the trumpets
[1:12:16] and this and that. And he said comes to
[1:12:18] verse 34 and said this generation shall
[1:12:20] not pass till all these things be
[1:12:22] fulfilled.
[1:12:24] And here's the problem.
[1:12:27] Historians and people who criticize
[1:12:30] Christ say that all those things did not
[1:12:33] come to pass and that generation had
[1:12:36] died. Therefore, Christ is a false
[1:12:39] prophet. Right? So verse 35, he is
[1:12:43] emphasizing heaven and earth shall pass
[1:12:45] away but my words in other words my
[1:12:47] words can never fail. Right? And how
[1:12:50] many times do I do I hear people when
[1:12:52] they're praying Lord you said heaven and
[1:12:54] earth shall pass away but my words shall
[1:12:55] never pass away. Your words never fail,
[1:12:57] Lord. Hallelujah. Glory to God. But here
[1:13:00] you have people who criticize the Lord
[1:13:02] Jesus Christ. So let me tell you, the
[1:13:05] Bible even tells you that even the
[1:13:08] disciples believed this that all these
[1:13:11] things that Christ spoke of in Matthew
[1:13:13] 24 were going to happen in their day.
[1:13:15] That's why they believed the second
[1:13:17] coming was going to happen in their day.
[1:13:19] Some believe that John John the divine
[1:13:22] the revelator might be the one who
[1:13:24] survived to see the coming but he died
[1:13:28] and then Jesus Christ hadn't come the
[1:13:30] second time. They claim brother Brandham
[1:13:33] is false because so many of his prophecy
[1:13:35] didn't come to pass. These same people
[1:13:37] cannot explain the scripture to me.
[1:13:40] Matthew 24:34-35 they cannot explain it.
[1:13:43] They have no explanation. I had one guy
[1:13:45] tell me, "No, no, no, no. It's related
[1:13:47] to the fig tree. Therefore, the
[1:13:50] generation he said this generation shall
[1:13:52] not pass is when the fig tree is
[1:13:54] budding. And it was 1949 when Israel
[1:13:57] became a nation. That's the generation.
[1:14:00] And then I said to him, hey, hold on a
[1:14:02] second. That generation has already
[1:14:04] passed. Have all these things happened
[1:14:07] now? Because he's speaking of this
[1:14:09] generation, this generation of the fig
[1:14:11] tree. So that generation has passed.
[1:14:14] Another generation has passed. And here
[1:14:16] we are and all these things have not
[1:14:18] come to pass yet
[1:14:21] speechless. They cannot. Right? So do
[1:14:25] you realize that all these accusations
[1:14:29] that they're making against the prophet
[1:14:31] have been made against Christ? And and
[1:14:34] here look listen look at the comparison.
[1:14:37] Brother Bam is gone 60 years and they're
[1:14:40] calling it failed prophecy. Christ has
[1:14:42] gone 2,000 years
[1:14:45] and apparently these have not come to
[1:14:48] pass. I'm just telling you what the
[1:14:50] atheists have said. We have knowledge of
[1:14:52] the revelation of all things. We know
[1:14:54] what's come to pass and where it is. We
[1:14:56] know what the fifth trumpet is, the
[1:14:57] sixth trumpet is. We know all those
[1:14:58] things. We can explain that. How do
[1:15:00] these people who leave the message and
[1:15:02] denounce everything? Church ages,
[1:15:04] trumpets, the way the prophet preached,
[1:15:06] how do they explain this? They can't.
[1:15:09] That's the truth. They can't throw it
[1:15:11] back at them. They don't know what to
[1:15:13] say. Right? So, what about the claim?
[1:15:16] Now, here's another one. I read this in
[1:15:17] the Time magazine
[1:15:20] like it could have been in the year 2000
[1:15:21] or something or somewhere where um
[1:15:24] something was written against the Bible
[1:15:26] and they said John chapter 17 where
[1:15:28] Jesus is praying in Gethsemane and all
[1:15:30] the disciples were sleeping. So, if all
[1:15:34] the disciples were sleeping, how could
[1:15:36] Jesus prayer have been recorded? There
[1:15:39] was nobody listening to him praying all
[1:15:41] by himself. So that means John 17 was
[1:15:45] made up and added later into it. It's so
[1:15:48] amazing because John 17 is actually the
[1:15:52] complete message of Christ the mystery
[1:15:54] of God revealed. It's phenomenal. It
[1:15:56] starts off with father glorify me now
[1:15:58] with the glory which I had before with
[1:16:00] the with thee before the world was. I
[1:16:03] mean that's like God in Christ. And then
[1:16:06] he said, "Father, I would that these be
[1:16:07] with me that that as I am with you, so
[1:16:10] they are with me and we are one." That
[1:16:12] is Christ in the bride. And then you
[1:16:14] find, "I pray for these, but not these
[1:16:16] alone, but those that should come that
[1:16:18] are none of this fault." It's just
[1:16:20] incredible. It's the entire chapter is
[1:16:22] Christ the mystery. But here you have
[1:16:24] historians and people and critics of the
[1:16:27] Bible saying it is false because if all
[1:16:30] the disciples were sleeping in
[1:16:31] Gethsemane, how could Jesus prayer have
[1:16:34] been heard? If it was all by himself,
[1:16:36] how could they have known his words?
[1:16:39] Therefore, it is made up. If you are a
[1:16:41] believer in Christ, if you're someone
[1:16:43] who read the message uh and now left the
[1:16:46] message, what is your answer to this
[1:16:48] accusation? because you're bringing the
[1:16:50] same kind of accusations against William
[1:16:52] Brandham.
[1:16:55] Some Christian historians say that there
[1:16:57] is proof that Jes proof that Jesus uh
[1:17:01] was not crucified. More unbelieving
[1:17:04] historians say there is no proof that
[1:17:06] Jesus was crucified at all. Right? But
[1:17:09] yet both Josephus and Tacitus confirmed
[1:17:13] that there was a man called Christ who
[1:17:16] was crucified. That's that's in their
[1:17:18] script. He was crucified under Pontius
[1:17:20] Pilate and Josephus confirms the
[1:17:23] existence of Christ and many amazing
[1:17:27] deeds that were done. But it is not
[1:17:30] enough for the educated world. You can't
[1:17:32] take this to an atheist and prove it.
[1:17:34] Okay. So in some of these writings like
[1:17:36] the book I told you about the Bible
[1:17:37] fraud claims that Jesus had a twin
[1:17:41] brother named Judas Crestus who was kept
[1:17:45] hidden and then was crucified in Jesus
[1:17:48] place because they were twins and then 3
[1:17:50] days later Crestus' death Judas Crestus
[1:17:54] was his death was covered up his body
[1:17:57] was disappeared and then Jesus comes out
[1:18:00] into the open to say that he was
[1:18:02] resurrected again. So that's a story and
[1:18:07] this is the story that's been given from
[1:18:09] the world that shows how the
[1:18:12] resurrection of Jesus Christ was done.
[1:18:16] Okay? And that the the plot was Judas
[1:18:19] Crestus was the body lying in the tomb
[1:18:22] that was stolen and buried somewhere.
[1:18:25] And now if you meet somebody you people
[1:18:28] of leave who leave the message, you meet
[1:18:30] somebody who brings this material to
[1:18:32] you. Can you argue with them? No.
[1:18:35] Because you have no solid proof of the
[1:18:37] resurrection. You have no solid proof of
[1:18:39] anything that Christ did 2,000 years
[1:18:42] later. You have no proof. All we have is
[1:18:45] the word of the disciples uh who are all
[1:18:48] dead. You cannot speak to them. And uh
[1:18:51] not all of their writings even get the
[1:18:53] story exactly the same. But we believe
[1:18:56] it because we have received the Holy
[1:18:59] Ghost.
[1:19:00] We have no scientific proof or
[1:19:03] historical proof of the death, burial,
[1:19:05] and resurrection of Jesus Christ. All we
[1:19:07] have is just the word of the four
[1:19:10] gospels. In fact, brother Brandham
[1:19:13] himself gives us increasing faith of
[1:19:17] what the four gospels are. He's more of
[1:19:20] a man who makes us believe in the Bible
[1:19:23] than to disbelieve the Bible. That's
[1:19:24] what I don't understand about these
[1:19:26] accusations. Okay. Accusation number
[1:19:29] three, they claim brother Madam was
[1:19:31] false because of the number of failed
[1:19:33] men in this message.
[1:19:35] Many people are falling away and and
[1:19:38] supposedly they are exposed as false
[1:19:40] teachers, false preachers. Okay. So they
[1:19:44] also claim that brother Madam ordained
[1:19:46] men who later brought in false doctrines
[1:19:49] and had marriage or immoral problems.
[1:19:52] Are those things true? Yes, many of
[1:19:55] those things are true. So they say if he
[1:19:58] was a true prophet, how could he not
[1:19:59] have seen what these men were and what
[1:20:02] they would do? That again is such a
[1:20:05] stupid argument and I'm sorry for saying
[1:20:07] that, but I'm not really sorry. Christ
[1:20:09] ordained Judas and the 70 Judas betrayed
[1:20:14] him. Peter denied him three times. And
[1:20:17] the 70 that that he prayed over and went
[1:20:20] around healing the sick and casting out
[1:20:22] devils in his name forsook him. What
[1:20:24] does that prove? So what is your
[1:20:26] argument? I don't get it. According to
[1:20:29] the Bible, Jesus Listen people, and I I
[1:20:32] say this to to our churches so many
[1:20:34] times. Listen, Jesus was the Messiah.
[1:20:37] You that leave the message and want to
[1:20:38] defend the me the Bible and Jesus Christ
[1:20:41] against the message, listen to me.
[1:20:45] Jesus Christ is the Messiah, the son of
[1:20:47] God, the son of man. And all he could
[1:20:50] get was 11 disciples and a church of 120
[1:20:54] people to believe him really.
[1:20:58] And you want the whole world to listen
[1:21:01] to brother Baram and and where brother
[1:21:02] Barham must be so perfect, right? That
[1:21:06] he must be so convincing, he must say
[1:21:08] things in such a way that it must please
[1:21:11] the mind of every rational thinking
[1:21:13] person. Yet Jesus Christ himself could
[1:21:15] only get 11 committed disciples and 120
[1:21:18] people in the first church. What is your
[1:21:21] argument? Because it really doesn't
[1:21:23] sound good.
[1:21:25] Being the Messiah, having the most
[1:21:27] reportedly amazing ministry, was that
[1:21:31] all was that all the people he could
[1:21:33] come up with in his time? Does that make
[1:21:36] Jesus false because he ordained men who
[1:21:39] were eventually going to reject him?
[1:21:41] Didn't he know? Well, he did. He said,
[1:21:45] "I've chosen the 12 of you, and one of
[1:21:47] you is the devil."
[1:21:49] All right, I could go on, people.
[1:21:52] There's so much to this. Um, accusation
[1:21:55] number four,
[1:21:57] the most favorite of all, the cloud of
[1:21:59] 1963.
[1:22:01] So, they claimed that brother Benham
[1:22:03] lied that he was there on February 28th,
[1:22:06] which I want to say he did not say.
[1:22:08] Brother Benham, there's no place in the
[1:22:10] message where he says he was there on
[1:22:12] February 28th.
[1:22:14] I've had this argument with people on
[1:22:16] both sides in the message and out.
[1:22:19] Because there are people in the message
[1:22:21] who say, "Brother Bam said he was there
[1:22:22] on February 28th." He doesn't, right?
[1:22:25] There are some who adamantly claim that
[1:22:27] he was there on February 20th. I found
[1:22:28] no place in the message where he says
[1:22:30] that. If you do, please show it to me.
[1:22:33] However, there are places in the message
[1:22:35] where he speaks as if he was there when
[1:22:38] the picture was taken. That's a problem,
[1:22:41] right? That's what gets people uh in
[1:22:44] nuts. But if you read enough of the
[1:22:47] message and you get to know how he
[1:22:50] speaks, then you will understand his
[1:22:52] words. The truth is he spoke like any
[1:22:56] flawed man. A man with flaws without the
[1:23:00] greatest articulation and with possible
[1:23:02] inconsistencies
[1:23:04] based on his own personal mental acuity
[1:23:07] and inabilities for which I believe God
[1:23:11] chose him. God chose him for the way he
[1:23:15] spoke, for exactly his grammar, for
[1:23:19] everything that he was. God chose him
[1:23:21] for the very reason. So I've heard
[1:23:24] people who live leave the message claim
[1:23:28] who told me, "Brother Perry Green's
[1:23:30] testimony was that the picture, the
[1:23:33] cloud picture was docked to make the
[1:23:36] face of Christ visible." Okay, fine. Uh
[1:23:40] probably it was done. I don't know. So I
[1:23:44] want to show you the actual magazine and
[1:23:47] picture. I photographed it. I have my
[1:23:49] own personal copy here of the actual
[1:23:51] life magazine
[1:23:53] uh the the the edition the May 17th
[1:23:56] edition. I have one of those here. It's
[1:23:59] was preserved over time. So, I've got
[1:24:01] one of them. So, I took a picture of it
[1:24:04] for you and I'm going to share that with
[1:24:06] you. Okay.
[1:24:09] Um here we are.
[1:24:13] So, this is the cover of the life
[1:24:16] magazine. You can see there governor and
[1:24:19] the new Mrs. Rockefeller. You can see
[1:24:21] the the date there at the bottom. May
[1:24:23] 17th, 1963. All right. So, this is the
[1:24:25] cover of the magazine. If you open it
[1:24:27] up, you will find this picture.
[1:24:31] Okay.
[1:24:33] A high cloud ring of mystery. Now,
[1:24:35] notice
[1:24:37] this is the actual original picture. And
[1:24:39] my magazine seems to have a little
[1:24:41] blemish and a fold there on the page. So
[1:24:44] that uh thing there in the center is not
[1:24:46] exactly in the picture. And on the right
[1:24:49] there is an article and other pictures
[1:24:53] taken from distances. You've got a
[1:24:55] picture taken from Phoenix. You got a
[1:24:58] picture taken from Prescott. You've got
[1:25:00] a picture taken from what is this?
[1:25:02] Winslow. So in other words, even though
[1:25:05] the cloud
[1:25:07] uh appeared over Flag Staff, it could be
[1:25:10] seen from cities miles away. That's how
[1:25:13] high this thing was. Okay. So then if
[1:25:17] you continue and you read the article,
[1:25:20] which is important, the article tells
[1:25:23] you it was taken the picture was taken
[1:25:25] over Febru February 28th. Uh watches
[1:25:28] struck by the clouds, odd shaped. So if
[1:25:30] you read also in this magazine on the on
[1:25:32] the the page just before this there's uh
[1:25:36] it seems like this section of the
[1:25:37] magazine was um printing like mysteries
[1:25:42] things that were unexplained on the
[1:25:44] other side were these like moon beams
[1:25:47] created in somewhere um oh or something
[1:25:50] like that. So uh it's like this segment
[1:25:53] where they were showing mysterious
[1:25:55] things. Okay. And this man Dr. James
[1:25:58] McDonald, a meteorologist at the
[1:26:00] Institute of Atmospheric Physics in
[1:26:02] Tucson. His words were, this is not
[1:26:04] brother Brandham's word, 26 mi high, 30
[1:26:06] mi across, a lot higher and bigger than
[1:26:10] a cloud should be. That's his words, uh,
[1:26:12] a circle was, the circle was too high to
[1:26:15] be made by a jet plane. As and I'm
[1:26:19] reading as far as Dr. Macdonald can
[1:26:21] determine there were no rockets, rocket
[1:26:24] planes, or bombs being tested nearby
[1:26:26] that day. He hopes anyone else with
[1:26:30] pictures will lend them to him. This is
[1:26:32] the article. For he would like some more
[1:26:34] clues about the cloud 26 mi up where no
[1:26:38] water droplets exist at the height to
[1:26:41] make at that height to make a cloud.
[1:26:44] So I'm saying to you that's the article
[1:26:48] brother Brandham read when it was
[1:26:50] published in May 17. He didn't make that
[1:26:53] up. That was written by the scientist.
[1:26:57] The scientist who took the picture said
[1:26:58] there were no rockets. There were no
[1:27:00] bombs. He had checked and then he was
[1:27:03] asking for other people to corroborate
[1:27:06] and whatever. So I don't know if he came
[1:27:08] up thereafter. I'm not even sure because
[1:27:10] I haven't read all the stuff on it. I
[1:27:12] really didn't have any interest in doing
[1:27:15] so because it really doesn't interest me
[1:27:18] because I know exactly what this whole
[1:27:20] thing is about and it doesn't matter to
[1:27:22] me. Right? So
[1:27:25] the picture and article were not
[1:27:27] influenced or written by brother
[1:27:29] Brandon. It was done before he was aware
[1:27:32] that it was even a cloud. The claim is
[1:27:36] now from what I'm hearing from what's
[1:27:39] been published in many places is that
[1:27:42] there was a Thor rocket which NASA fired
[1:27:46] on the west coast and it was most
[1:27:49] probably the cloud from that rocket that
[1:27:53] made this thing. So what is the truth of
[1:27:55] it? The truth is brother Brandham was
[1:27:58] never there on February 28th when this
[1:28:00] thing was photographed. Right. Right. By
[1:28:03] his own accounts, he was traveling to
[1:28:05] see a young man on death row in Houston,
[1:28:08] and he only arrived back in time for hog
[1:28:11] hunting season to be open. By his own
[1:28:13] account, he was probably there in the
[1:28:16] region between the 5th and the 8th of
[1:28:19] March, which would be one week or so
[1:28:22] after the cloud had appeared over Flag
[1:28:25] Staff. That's one week later. You'll
[1:28:28] you'll literally hear him say in the
[1:28:30] message like in the breach message uh he
[1:28:33] said a week or 10 days the breach
[1:28:35] message was on the 17th of March 1963.
[1:28:38] He says something like a week or 10 days
[1:28:41] ago this happened and he was in Tucson
[1:28:43] and so on and he gives an account. So
[1:28:47] one week later is his testimony. But yet
[1:28:49] when he speaks about it while preaching
[1:28:52] in a passion of preaching he's afterward
[1:28:56] after seeing the article and recognizing
[1:28:58] this cloud right during that hunting
[1:29:02] trip he has an experience. He details
[1:29:05] the experience when he comes to preach
[1:29:08] the seals. He talks about an experience
[1:29:11] that he has. He does not mention what
[1:29:13] shape or what the cloud look like. He
[1:29:15] talks about this pyramid-shaped
[1:29:17] constellation
[1:29:18] and he only talks about the experience.
[1:29:21] Perhaps in the experience as it went up
[1:29:24] it formed a shape. As it went, that's
[1:29:26] the best we know. When he sees it in the
[1:29:29] magazine, he didn't see a doctorred
[1:29:32] picture which someone else doctorred it.
[1:29:36] But when he sees this picture that I
[1:29:38] just showed you and reads that article,
[1:29:41] it immediately resonates with him.
[1:29:44] Nobody has to tell him. It immediately
[1:29:46] resonates with him. That's his
[1:29:48] experience, right? And he already had
[1:29:51] the experience before the picture was
[1:29:54] published. When he speaks about it
[1:29:57] afterward, he's like all over the place.
[1:29:59] So excited. His stories about it over
[1:30:02] the next 2 and 1/2 years are conflicting
[1:30:04] in the details of where, what, and which
[1:30:07] date, but the experience he has still
[1:30:10] remains the same. Seven angels appear
[1:30:14] constellation telling him about the
[1:30:15] seals. That's the experience. The story
[1:30:18] about the cloud might be conflicting but
[1:30:20] the experience is exactly the same. Only
[1:30:25] in Easter of 1965 is he urged by the
[1:30:28] Holy Spirit to turn the picture to the
[1:30:30] right and he identifies it is our Lord
[1:30:34] up there. Right? He details over those
[1:30:37] two 2.5 years uh all over the place. But
[1:30:42] he even says in what is the attraction
[1:30:45] on the mount. So let let me give you an
[1:30:47] example. So in what is the attraction on
[1:30:50] the mount is the only time he actually
[1:30:52] mentions sunset mountain. The only time
[1:30:56] he speaks out where he always talks
[1:30:58] about being in Tucson and so on and so
[1:31:00] on. But then he says in what is the
[1:31:03] attraction of the mountain? He says
[1:31:04] something like, "Get on the map and see
[1:31:06] if sunset peak there." Watch this. He
[1:31:09] says, "That's exactly where it happened.
[1:31:12] I never know it till the other day." So
[1:31:16] in what is the attraction? 1965 is the
[1:31:20] only time he speaks about Sunset
[1:31:22] Mountain. Why? Because whatever happened
[1:31:25] when he was in Tucson or wherever he was
[1:31:28] or whichever place he was in, this is
[1:31:30] his account. You can't go and try to
[1:31:32] argue with these believe the sign people
[1:31:35] or people leaving the message and make
[1:31:37] and put your own facts in there. You'll
[1:31:39] just come up short. Don't do that.
[1:31:41] Right? Whatever happened after his death
[1:31:46] was because by those who followed him,
[1:31:49] many brothers in the message were
[1:31:52] zealous message people who made the
[1:31:54] mistake like all people who idolize a
[1:31:58] man. When people respect a man, listen
[1:32:00] people, I've got some of the books here
[1:32:02] myself. When you respect a man, you make
[1:32:06] an idol out of him, right? You you make
[1:32:10] books about him. You write books. You
[1:32:12] print books about him. You'll print
[1:32:14] better books about him. You'll print his
[1:32:16] name in gold and silver. You'll enhance
[1:32:19] pictures about him. You'll use even AI
[1:32:22] to brush things up and make them look
[1:32:24] even prettier, make it nicer to because
[1:32:27] you want people to share in your
[1:32:29] excitement. All the while doing so, you
[1:32:32] are tapping into a human element of
[1:32:34] idolizing somebody or something. So,
[1:32:38] this was no mistake. My point is, young
[1:32:41] people, if you're confused, older
[1:32:44] people, if you're confused, I'm telling
[1:32:45] you right now, this was no mistake. God
[1:32:49] permitted it because God knew it's going
[1:32:52] to happen. This is what you've got to
[1:32:54] understand, right? When uh it had to be
[1:32:59] God permitted it. God. Do you really
[1:33:01] think if God was with William Brandham
[1:33:04] all his life, gave him visions, gave him
[1:33:08] the word, this this uneducated man gave
[1:33:11] him the word and that what he was going
[1:33:13] to say was not going to produce this
[1:33:15] whole ruckus
[1:33:17] in the the after the year 2000, did you
[1:33:21] really think God did not know this was
[1:33:23] going to happen? Do you think this just
[1:33:25] happened by mistake and these people all
[1:33:26] are suddenly incentivized to to go out
[1:33:29] and uh come against the message and
[1:33:31] publish stuff? Did you think God did not
[1:33:34] know this was going to happen? Well, of
[1:33:35] course he did. This exactly why he chose
[1:33:37] the man to say those things to actually
[1:33:41] produce the problem.
[1:33:44] People made it all about them, but it
[1:33:46] had nothing to do with them. Cloud has
[1:33:48] nothing to do with you people.
[1:33:50] Sorry. It was all to do with him. His
[1:33:54] experience and this picture taken by
[1:33:57] strangers served to do only one thing
[1:34:00] and one thing for him to vindicate to
[1:34:04] him the seventh seal to him personally
[1:34:08] to strengthen him to complete his work.
[1:34:12] How do we know this?
[1:34:14] Many people saw the cloud in that time.
[1:34:16] It meant nothing to them. It still
[1:34:18] doesn't. But to him it meant something
[1:34:20] because he had a vision of Christ in
[1:34:23] Miller's field as a young man. Later he
[1:34:27] sees a Hoffman's head painting in Billy
[1:34:29] Sunday's church. And then he connects
[1:34:32] the person he sees in a vision in
[1:34:33] Millersfield to the one he sees in Billy
[1:34:36] Sunday's church on the Hoffman's head
[1:34:37] and said that is the closest that's the
[1:34:40] kind of person I never saw Hoffman's
[1:34:42] head before but the one I saw in a
[1:34:44] vision in Millisfield looks so close to
[1:34:47] Hoffman's head only to realize that
[1:34:50] years later a cloud is going to appear
[1:34:53] which he's not even going to photograph
[1:34:55] but that that picture of Hoffman's head
[1:34:58] is going to fit so perfectly ly into the
[1:35:01] cloud.
[1:35:02] You can do that with the picture taken
[1:35:05] in this magazine, right? You don't have
[1:35:08] to doctor the picture. It actually fits
[1:35:10] in there. It's going to appeal to him
[1:35:13] personally. If you and I saw it, we
[1:35:15] would never have thought of it because
[1:35:16] we didn't see Millisfield experience. We
[1:35:19] didn't have Milisfield experience. We
[1:35:21] didn't see it for the first time in
[1:35:22] Billy Sunday's church. No, we were told
[1:35:25] this happened, this happened, this
[1:35:26] happened. You accept it by faith, right?
[1:35:30] uh you'll actually read about this in
[1:35:31] spiritual food induces paragraph 85 to
[1:35:34] 87. So to say these people influenced by
[1:35:39] these websites to say he was lying all
[1:35:42] the time would mean he actually had the
[1:35:46] incentive or the intent to deceive. Did
[1:35:50] he really? This is all happening in real
[1:35:52] time. Did he really? Did William
[1:35:55] Brandham know? Oh my, I got to say all
[1:35:58] this about this cloud because I'm going
[1:35:59] to deceive thousands and thousands of
[1:36:01] people after I'm dead.
[1:36:04] Really? Did he this man really have the
[1:36:07] smart to deceive the FBI
[1:36:10] to deceive people among them? He was
[1:36:12] like he must have been the most one of
[1:36:14] the most brightest geniuses of his time
[1:36:16] to have duped so many people. Right.
[1:36:21] Okay.
[1:36:23] um when you look at it and he says, "I
[1:36:26] didn't even know this about Sunset
[1:36:28] Mountain. I didn't even know this until
[1:36:29] the other day." He was like, "Didn't you
[1:36:31] read the article properly?" Right? Okay.
[1:36:34] The way to look at this young people is
[1:36:36] to look at the first coming.
[1:36:39] Um so remember now this is an these are
[1:36:42] accusations brought against brother
[1:36:44] Benam. He was the only one who
[1:36:46] recognized Christ in the cloud. It was
[1:36:49] his record that that is our Lord up
[1:36:52] there. Okay, are you ready for this?
[1:36:55] Here's John the Baptist who's waiting
[1:36:58] for a sign in the heaven to show him who
[1:37:01] Christ is.
[1:37:03] Listen people, wake up and smell the
[1:37:05] coffee. Jesus was his cousin,
[1:37:09] so to speak. He played with him. They
[1:37:12] had family gettogethers together when
[1:37:14] they were kids. They had functions
[1:37:16] together. They had maybe bomb mitzvah
[1:37:19] together. I don't know. But they were
[1:37:21] cousins. They visited one another. He
[1:37:23] knew this man. He knew this this
[1:37:26] teenager who he played with. He was 6
[1:37:27] months older than him or something like
[1:37:29] that. But he was he saw him. He saw how
[1:37:32] weird this guy was. He saw you know the
[1:37:35] way he acted. But you know he didn't he
[1:37:38] must have heard the prophecies. His
[1:37:41] mother, Elizabeth, would have spoken of
[1:37:44] Mary and how what had happened and how
[1:37:46] that when she spoke, the babe leapt in
[1:37:48] the womb. He must have heard all that.
[1:37:50] But through his entire life, you mean to
[1:37:52] tell me he lived with Jesus Christ and
[1:37:54] didn't know he's the Messiah and he was
[1:37:56] waiting for a sign in the heaven? Come
[1:37:58] on people, wake up.
[1:38:01] Read the Bible better. Right? So when
[1:38:04] the sign only when the sign came then
[1:38:08] John who's the cousin of Jesus says oh
[1:38:11] it's you and it takes a sign from heaven
[1:38:15] to show me this really you people living
[1:38:19] the message because you believe the sign
[1:38:21] what is your answer to this
[1:38:24] right the man is living with with Christ
[1:38:28] knows who Jesus is but needs a sign from
[1:38:30] heaven to say this well that is what a
[1:38:32] prophet needs for vindication ation.
[1:38:34] Let's read John 1:31-35.
[1:38:40] All right. Are you still with me? Praise
[1:38:42] be to God. I know it's taking long, but
[1:38:45] I got to get through this. And I knew
[1:38:46] him not, but that he should be manifest
[1:38:48] to Israel. Therefore am I come baptizing
[1:38:51] with water. This is John speaking. And
[1:38:54] John bare record. I saw I saw the spirit
[1:38:58] descending from heaven like a dove and
[1:39:00] it abodeed upon him. And I knew him not.
[1:39:05] I knew him not.
[1:39:07] Hold on. You didn't hear your mother
[1:39:11] speaking about Mary and her baby. You
[1:39:14] Nobody told you what happened in the
[1:39:16] temple at 12. You see this guy? He's
[1:39:19] your He's your cousin. He's He's so
[1:39:20] weird. He's always so knowledgeable
[1:39:23] about the gospel. Can you don't know? I
[1:39:26] knew him not. What are you talking
[1:39:28] about? But he that sent me to baptize
[1:39:30] with water, which means John heard a
[1:39:32] voice telling him to go and baptize with
[1:39:34] water. Same said unto me, upon whom thou
[1:39:38] shalt see the spirit descending and
[1:39:40] remaining on him, the same is he which
[1:39:42] baptized with the Holy Ghost. Which
[1:39:43] means John who lived with Jesus for
[1:39:46] about 30 years was unsure that he was
[1:39:50] the Messiah. And you got people today
[1:39:53] believing that Jesus will come and
[1:39:54] they'll be so sure they'll know exactly
[1:39:56] who he is. You know, I don't understand.
[1:40:00] These people don't read the Bible
[1:40:01] properly. In verse 34, he says, "And I
[1:40:05] saw and bear record that this is the son
[1:40:09] of God."
[1:40:12] Right? So, I saw and I bear record that
[1:40:17] this is the son of God. So here he sees
[1:40:19] his cousin walking to him and at the
[1:40:22] time after 30 years his cousin comes
[1:40:25] walking to him on the banks of the the
[1:40:27] Jordan to come and be baptized of him
[1:40:29] and he sees a sign in the heaven. Now
[1:40:31] here's the question. Did everybody else
[1:40:34] see that sign
[1:40:37] h
[1:40:40] no only John saw it. Why?
[1:40:44] Right. And here's something. Somehow the
[1:40:48] Jews knew that Messiah would be
[1:40:50] identified by a sign from heaven. Right?
[1:40:52] That's why they kept asking. Go read
[1:40:54] Matthew 16:1, Mark 8:11, Luke 11:16.
[1:40:59] Show us a sign from heaven. Show us a
[1:41:00] sign from heaven to show that you're the
[1:41:02] Messiah. Somehow they knew even Jesus
[1:41:04] Christ himself said that spoke of the
[1:41:07] sign of the son of man appearing in the
[1:41:09] heavens relating to the second coming.
[1:41:13] So it's actually a thing. A sign in the
[1:41:15] heaven to to show the sign of the coming
[1:41:19] is a thing that forerunners are supposed
[1:41:22] to identify. It seemed like John knew
[1:41:24] this. He was not just going to accept
[1:41:27] what they said about Jesus, about what
[1:41:30] his mother said about Jesus, about the
[1:41:32] accounts of Mary and Joseph. He was not
[1:41:34] just going to accept that. He was
[1:41:36] waiting as the forerunner for a sign
[1:41:39] from the heaven which only he would
[1:41:41] recognize, he would identify and it
[1:41:44] would only vindicate to him personally.
[1:41:49] That's why I say to you that cloud is
[1:41:51] not about you, right? It's about him. It
[1:41:55] was only for him to vindicate something
[1:41:58] to him concerning the seventh seal. It
[1:42:02] was only for him. You can do all you
[1:42:04] want to to make it about you. It's just
[1:42:06] not. So don't even waste your time
[1:42:08] trying to defend it or try to go back
[1:42:11] and it was not for you. Stop making it
[1:42:14] about you and the bride and everybody
[1:42:16] else. It was for him. He bear record. He
[1:42:21] spoke about it. He said, "Go read the
[1:42:23] message." What was that circle of light?
[1:42:26] It was him vindicating his word. Amen.
[1:42:32] Okay.
[1:42:33] So what was that was the purpose of the
[1:42:35] forerunner. It was a sign. It was not a
[1:42:38] sign everyone would accept. You know I
[1:42:40] even said when I was preaching about it
[1:42:42] I said to the people
[1:42:45] John looked up and sees the spirit of
[1:42:47] God descending like a dove. It wasn't a
[1:42:49] dove. It was something like a dove.
[1:42:51] Could it have been a cloud in the shape
[1:42:52] of a dove? Could there have been
[1:42:54] something that opened up the sky and
[1:42:56] something looked like a shape of a dove
[1:42:58] and light beaming down on Christ as he
[1:43:00] walked to the river? Somebody looking
[1:43:02] from the north or the south or the east
[1:43:04] or the west seeing the same thing must
[1:43:06] have said, "hm, that looks like a dog or
[1:43:08] a cloud. Oh, it's pointless." Like, what
[1:43:10] is that? Maybe most people didn't even
[1:43:13] see it. Maybe most people didn't even
[1:43:15] care. Only John recognized it and it
[1:43:19] resonated with him and he preached that
[1:43:23] is the coming of the Lord.
[1:43:26] Okay.
[1:43:27] Now as the church of tomorrow you have
[1:43:29] to be prepared for such things. You have
[1:43:32] to see the purpose of God choosing
[1:43:34] brother Benham was so that the message
[1:43:37] would be rejected by many. Wake up
[1:43:40] people. Do you really think there's
[1:43:42] going to come an Elijah who's going to
[1:43:44] be accepted by everybody?
[1:43:46] I don't understand. This is why I say
[1:43:48] people leaving the message didn't really
[1:43:50] see the message. Because if you really
[1:43:52] see the message, then you know these
[1:43:55] things had to be okay.
[1:43:59] So the message that you believe is going
[1:44:02] to be on trial. That's why my title is
[1:44:05] the message on trial. It's going to be
[1:44:08] on trial exactly like Christ is right.
[1:44:11] I'm telling you right now, the message
[1:44:13] you believed has to be on trial. It has
[1:44:16] to be picked apart. It has to be
[1:44:18] disproved. It has to be shamed just like
[1:44:22] Christ was. It has to be broken down. It
[1:44:25] has to be trampled on. It has to be
[1:44:27] crushed in a way that it has to shake
[1:44:30] you to your roots and shake your very
[1:44:32] core of your belief.
[1:44:35] It has to be that way. It was ordained
[1:44:38] to be that way. That's why God chose
[1:44:41] that man. If he chose me, ought to have
[1:44:43] messed it all up. He chose that man for
[1:44:47] that purpose. That's exactly why it is
[1:44:49] necessary. While everyone else focuses
[1:44:52] on that, the bride focuses on the word.
[1:44:56] Everyone else is going to focus on
[1:44:58] proving him wrong, defending him or
[1:45:00] something, the bride is focusing on the
[1:45:02] word. The question you have to ask
[1:45:05] yourself, young people, is are you going
[1:45:07] to be able to stand when everything
[1:45:09] around you is proving it wrong?
[1:45:13] Will you stand when your friends, your
[1:45:15] loved ones, your mother, your father,
[1:45:17] your brother, your sister fall away and
[1:45:20] are deceived by what they read or what
[1:45:21] they see or watch. Young people, you are
[1:45:25] the church of tomorrow. What are you
[1:45:26] going to to do? How are you going to be
[1:45:28] prepared for what's coming? Okay, I'm
[1:45:30] going to ask you some real questions as
[1:45:32] we close and answer me this.
[1:45:36] Which Christian denomination
[1:45:39] can you name for me right now that will
[1:45:43] you can actually depend on? If you leave
[1:45:45] this message right now, which one are
[1:45:48] you going to go to that will withstand
[1:45:50] the mark of the beast?
[1:45:52] Tell me which one. Which Christian
[1:45:55] denomination, if you leave the message,
[1:45:58] which one is totally perfect and
[1:46:02] dependable? Pentecostals, Episcopalians,
[1:46:06] Baptist, Anglican,
[1:46:08] Jehovah's Witness, 7th Adventist. Which
[1:46:11] one is perfectly on the money with the
[1:46:15] Godhead, with Jesus, with the deity of
[1:46:18] Christ, with predestination, with the
[1:46:21] original sin, with baptism the correct
[1:46:24] way? Which one is the one that will not
[1:46:27] fold to the mark of the beast? Which
[1:46:30] one? Which church is not interested in
[1:46:34] having a lobby in the political world to
[1:46:38] need funding from the government? Which
[1:46:40] one?
[1:46:42] Which church has the word that can
[1:46:45] sustain you and keep you for what's
[1:46:49] coming?
[1:46:51] So, I have no reason to convince you.
[1:46:53] The choice is completely yours. We have
[1:46:56] no reason to fight against you. I have
[1:46:58] no reason to fight against believe the
[1:47:00] sign or seek ye the truth or whoever
[1:47:02] they be. I am not I don't want to be an
[1:47:05] apologist. I don't want to defend
[1:47:06] brother Madam's misstatement here or
[1:47:09] this statement there or uh how this was
[1:47:12] said or whether he made a mistake with
[1:47:13] the number or I don't I don't have the
[1:47:16] desire to do that. I don't even have the
[1:47:17] time to do that. I'm not going to do it.
[1:47:20] It's very simple. It's entirely your
[1:47:23] choice. The question comes down to what
[1:47:26] went you out to see?
[1:47:29] What did you see? A reed shaken in the
[1:47:31] wind? A prophet? It's your choice,
[1:47:36] right? Concerning Christ, Christian
[1:47:39] apologists claim that Josephus and
[1:47:41] Tacitus may not have reported Christ's
[1:47:44] miracles because his deeds may have been
[1:47:47] suppressed by the Jews or Rome.
[1:47:50] So I'm saying let's say believe the sign
[1:47:53] and seek ye the truth have good
[1:47:55] intentions. Let's say they are being
[1:47:57] fair, which I don't think they are
[1:47:59] really. If you are doing proper
[1:48:02] investigations and proper journalism,
[1:48:04] you want to you want to present
[1:48:06] something to the public, you should be
[1:48:09] unbiased. Okay? So, if you really want
[1:48:12] to be fair and unbiased, why only
[1:48:15] interview people who are anti- William
[1:48:18] Brandham, people who are disgruntled and
[1:48:21] hurt by a church, and you interview them
[1:48:24] and make them give their testimony and
[1:48:26] publish it. Why only interview people
[1:48:29] who are who are anti? Why not interview
[1:48:33] people on the other side and say,
[1:48:35] "Here's what these people said, but
[1:48:37] let's interview brother so and so and
[1:48:39] let's hear what he say." Why not
[1:48:40] interview somebody who is pro- William
[1:48:42] Brandon? Let him have his say. Don't
[1:48:44] debate him. Why not interview all those
[1:48:47] people who say this prophecy did come
[1:48:49] true? I was healed in the meetings. I
[1:48:52] get people here in South Africa who
[1:48:54] believe they were healed in Brother
[1:48:56] Barham's meetings uh nobody interviews
[1:48:59] them
[1:49:01] uh to to come forward. Why not put it on
[1:49:03] your website and say well here's all the
[1:49:05] testimonies against William Brandom.
[1:49:07] Here's all the testimonies for William
[1:49:09] Brandham. Here's all now here's the
[1:49:12] unbiased record. You decide. No, they're
[1:49:16] not willing to do that. Nobody's willing
[1:49:18] to do that. So young people for all the
[1:49:21] testimonies you hear of the naysayers
[1:49:23] who left the message and tell you how
[1:49:25] they were in a cult and they were with
[1:49:27] this minister and this one did to them.
[1:49:29] Why don't you listen to the thousands of
[1:49:31] people who are actually happy in the
[1:49:33] message who are thrilled with the their
[1:49:37] minister and the their life in the
[1:49:39] message and they are happy and they will
[1:49:41] tell you of their salvation and a
[1:49:42] healing and how the message made them
[1:49:44] give up smoking and drinking and a life
[1:49:46] of of drug addiction and all that. Why
[1:49:50] not hear their testimony? Why only all
[1:49:52] the negative? Are you really being fair?
[1:49:56] Right? Why not? Why will not believe the
[1:49:59] side in seeking the truth not just
[1:50:01] report what these people say that is for
[1:50:05] the message and leave it at that?
[1:50:08] Why? Why not do that? That would be fair
[1:50:11] and balanced critique.
[1:50:13] Academic fair and balanced critique.
[1:50:16] Nope. They will not do that because it
[1:50:18] it goes against the incentive and the
[1:50:20] aim to prove that he's a false prophet.
[1:50:24] I can tell you there are scores of
[1:50:25] people who will stand up right now and
[1:50:28] say, "I was in the meetings. He was the
[1:50:30] true prophet. I was in the meetings. I
[1:50:33] was there. Uh my daughter was healed. My
[1:50:37] child was healed." There's many people
[1:50:38] who will be willing to stand up and say
[1:50:40] it. But they'll not search them out.
[1:50:43] They'll not interview them. People who
[1:50:45] are inspired by these sites. Now, I'm
[1:50:47] not talking about the people who made
[1:50:49] the sites. I'm talking about those
[1:50:50] inspired by the people who now speak to
[1:50:52] me and say, "I'm leaving the message.
[1:50:53] I'm disgruntled." Whatever. I found
[1:50:56] this. They are hurt. They are emotional.
[1:50:59] And now they are just anti-brenham. And
[1:51:01] they try to argue the word, but they
[1:51:04] betray the fact that they themselves do
[1:51:07] not know the Bible well enough to even
[1:51:09] support their views. They just don't
[1:51:11] because while they were in the message,
[1:51:13] they didn't study the message or the
[1:51:14] Bible. They didn't even know the
[1:51:15] scriptures. So they just spew something
[1:51:18] out from a website. They themselves do
[1:51:20] not even have when you speak to them,
[1:51:22] you can hear they're not confident. It
[1:51:25] belongs to the people who created the
[1:51:27] website and did the videos. They're the
[1:51:29] ones who are putting it out. So this is
[1:51:32] an amazing thing that you can find on
[1:51:35] the internet. So I I just just for the
[1:51:37] sake of the young people, you go to the
[1:51:40] internet and I did this with with I
[1:51:43] asked the uh co-pilot on my browser, the
[1:51:46] AI, give me the historical evidence for
[1:51:50] the resurrection of Christ. And here it
[1:51:52] spits out all these things and facts and
[1:51:55] all this kind of stuff that's there. But
[1:51:57] I want to show you this is amazing,
[1:51:59] right? And I want to share this with
[1:52:01] you.
[1:52:03] This is what AI says.
[1:52:06] All right. The AI analysis, it says the
[1:52:10] historical evidence for the resurrection
[1:52:13] rests on documented eyewitness testimony
[1:52:18] corroborated across multiple independent
[1:52:22] sources.
[1:52:23] Early attestation of empty tomb and
[1:52:27] post-mortem appearances.
[1:52:29] behavioral transformations of disciples
[1:52:33] and enemies.
[1:52:35] In other words, the effect of Christ on
[1:52:40] the disciples and enemies is proof of
[1:52:43] Christ.
[1:52:45] Rapid emergence of a movement centered
[1:52:49] on these claims. Now, here's the AI's
[1:52:52] assessment. Given these convergent
[1:52:55] strands, many historians argue that the
[1:53:00] resurrection of Jesus Christ provides
[1:53:03] the most coherent explanation of the
[1:53:06] cumulative historical data through
[1:53:09] interpretations though interpretations
[1:53:11] vary between naturalistic and theistic
[1:53:15] framework. So what this is saying is
[1:53:18] because of these things because of these
[1:53:20] four things he had eyewitnesses
[1:53:23] an empty tomb early early attestation of
[1:53:27] empty tomb. In other words, not long
[1:53:29] after the fact, they said the tomb is
[1:53:31] empty. Early attestation behavioral
[1:53:34] transformation. That means the way
[1:53:36] people were taken up and the way a
[1:53:39] movement was formed so rapidly
[1:53:42] is why historians seem to believe that
[1:53:45] Jesus Christ was actually true and that
[1:53:48] his resurrection was actually true. So
[1:53:52] I'm saying by that standard people
[1:53:56] after brother Baron you have documented
[1:53:59] eyewitness testimony corroborated across
[1:54:02] multiple independent sources. You have
[1:54:05] early attestation of events that took
[1:54:08] place in his life. You have behavioral
[1:54:10] transformations of disciples and
[1:54:13] enemies. And you have a rapid emergence
[1:54:16] of a movement centered on all those
[1:54:18] things.
[1:54:20] I am asking you, is this proof that
[1:54:23] there was a prophet amongst us in our
[1:54:26] day and that God was with him? Okay,
[1:54:30] maybe it's not enough. Who needs to
[1:54:31] trust AI anyway? Let's live by faith.
[1:54:34] So, in closing,
[1:54:36] let's assume that Malachi 4:5 and 6 was
[1:54:40] manifested in the time of John the
[1:54:42] Baptist. I'm asking you young people and
[1:54:46] those who are confused, discouraged by
[1:54:48] the prophet, who will feel like you want
[1:54:50] to leave the message. If you say that
[1:54:53] Malachi 4:5 and 6 was John the Baptist,
[1:54:55] I'm asking you, is everything in Malachi
[1:54:58] 4, was it all manifested in John the
[1:55:01] Baptist day? Was John the Baptist day
[1:55:05] and Christ, was that the great and
[1:55:08] dreadful day of the Lord that occurred
[1:55:10] after John the Baptist? The question is,
[1:55:13] what do you believe? What do you
[1:55:15] believe? Do you believe that John the
[1:55:17] Baptist came to turn the hearts of all
[1:55:19] the fathers to the children and the
[1:55:21] children to the fathers? And do you
[1:55:23] believe that it was accomplished in John
[1:55:25] the Baptist day?
[1:55:27] Did John turn the hearts of the fathers
[1:55:30] to the children and the children to the
[1:55:31] fathers?
[1:55:33] Did he do it? Do you have proof of that?
[1:55:36] If you believe that, then that's okay.
[1:55:39] And it remains to be seen whether it was
[1:55:41] true and achieved in its purpose. From
[1:55:43] my knowledge and my reading and my
[1:55:45] assessment of what happened in history,
[1:55:47] it doesn't look like it was achieved.
[1:55:49] Who were the children? Who were the
[1:55:51] fathers? How were their hearts turned?
[1:55:54] Everybody rejected Christ. So whose
[1:55:56] hearts were turned?
[1:55:58] What's your explanation?
[1:56:01] My next question, if you're expecting
[1:56:04] Elijah to return in this day,
[1:56:08] are you expecting an articulate man with
[1:56:11] perfect speech, who gets nothing wrong,
[1:56:14] who convinces everybody of what he is
[1:56:18] saying, who proves everything to the
[1:56:20] world, who performs perfectly documented
[1:56:24] miracles and signs that are accepted by
[1:56:27] the whole world. And do you are you
[1:56:30] expecting a man who preaches a message
[1:56:32] that is so easily understood perfectly
[1:56:36] accepted by everybody? Is that your
[1:56:39] expectation?
[1:56:42] Uh because it's a very unrealistic
[1:56:44] expectation because that is absolutely
[1:56:47] not an Elijah.
[1:56:49] And Elijah is a completely all over the
[1:56:51] place messed up individual
[1:56:54] who nobody accepts and who's running for
[1:56:57] his life.
[1:57:00] What kind of Elijah are you expecting?
[1:57:02] Okay. In fact, the Elijah that appears
[1:57:06] in Revelations 11 who must come to the
[1:57:09] 144,000
[1:57:10] is so unaccepted that they kill them.
[1:57:13] Moses and Elijah are killed and their
[1:57:15] bodies lie dead in the streets for 3
[1:57:17] days. So, what kind of Elijah were you
[1:57:19] expecting? One whose thus sayeth the
[1:57:21] Lord's were perfect. One whose words
[1:57:24] were impeccable. One who never gets
[1:57:27] anything upside down. One who's accepted
[1:57:29] by everybody. One who everybody must
[1:57:32] believe. One who's going to make all the
[1:57:34] churches unite until they all so
[1:57:36] loveydvey and love one another and hugs
[1:57:38] all around. Is that the Elijah you
[1:57:40] accepting?
[1:57:42] Because if it is, expecting because if
[1:57:44] it is, you're not reading your Bible
[1:57:46] properly. Okay, I just want to also say
[1:57:50] you know the song these are the days of
[1:57:52] Elijah, right?
[1:57:56] That was not written by message people.
[1:57:59] Clearly there are scores of people in
[1:58:01] the denominations who are expecting an
[1:58:04] Elijah to return. That song was written
[1:58:07] these are the days of Elijah
[1:58:09] right there. They were written by
[1:58:11] Pentecostal people who are waiting for
[1:58:13] the coming of the Lord and are expecting
[1:58:14] an Elijah of sorts. That's why you had
[1:58:17] all those people on the internet
[1:58:18] claiming to be Elijah. Those of you who
[1:58:21] are leaving the message or have left the
[1:58:24] message or wondering whether you should
[1:58:27] leave the message, think about what kind
[1:58:29] of Elijah you think God should send to
[1:58:32] convince you
[1:58:34] of the coming of Christ. And what
[1:58:36] exactly do you want that should happen?
[1:58:39] How exactly you think it's going to
[1:58:41] happen that the Elijah God sent is going
[1:58:44] to convince you? What is it going to
[1:58:46] take to convince you of the coming of
[1:58:48] Christ?
[1:58:50] If you consider this with a clear heart
[1:58:52] and come up with an idea of what the
[1:58:55] majority of people want, you are going
[1:58:57] to realize how completely off your
[1:59:00] expectation is with regards to the Bible
[1:59:03] and the consistency of the word. It is
[1:59:06] certainly a frightening time for the
[1:59:07] world that we are living in right now.
[1:59:09] And people want a convenient God. They
[1:59:12] want a message that accommodates sinful
[1:59:14] living and unrighteousness. They want a
[1:59:16] message that doesn't judge their deeds
[1:59:17] and allows them to do whatever they want
[1:59:19] to do. They want a message that makes
[1:59:21] people feel good about themselves and
[1:59:23] doesn't challenge their doubts. All the
[1:59:25] prophecies in the Bible warn us of what
[1:59:28] is coming and tells us that there will
[1:59:31] be a massive falling away from the
[1:59:34] truth. So I'm not really sure what all
[1:59:36] these people who are leaving the message
[1:59:38] were inspired who were inspired by these
[1:59:41] websites. What what are they actually
[1:59:43] expecting? But I hope and pray for all
[1:59:47] mankind including those who leave that
[1:59:49] we all find grace in his sight and mercy
[1:59:53] at his throne. Lastly, if you are
[1:59:56] someone who has been hurt by a church
[1:59:59] and people, consider that people are
[2:00:02] just people who tried that to do their
[2:00:04] best. It isn't easy running a church.
[2:00:07] Those of you young people who are hurt
[2:00:09] by a pastor or the deacons or something,
[2:00:11] I want you to think about what you would
[2:00:13] do if you were a pastor. You were the
[2:00:15] deacon. How would you handle things in
[2:00:17] your in your situation? You do not know
[2:00:21] what it takes to run a church, to to
[2:00:24] manage people, to be a shepherd.
[2:00:28] Uh would you allow your daughter to
[2:00:32] marry someone who comes in with
[2:00:36] piercings and tattoos of a devil on his
[2:00:38] left shoulder and says, "I don't believe
[2:00:40] in God." What would you how would you
[2:00:43] tell your daughter that you can't marry
[2:00:46] this boy, that I'm not in favor? How
[2:00:47] would you handle it?
[2:00:50] Hugs, kisses, roses, chocolates. Tell
[2:00:53] me, tell me. Be honest. Be rational. Be
[2:00:57] rational in your thinking. And if you
[2:00:58] come up to me as a pastor and tell me,
[2:01:00] "Brother All, I want to marry this girl,
[2:01:02] but she hates William Brandon." You You
[2:01:04] really want me to be okay with that? Do
[2:01:06] you really want me to say to you, "Hey,
[2:01:08] look, son, that's okay. It's your
[2:01:11] choice. We're good. You know, it's
[2:01:13] fine." Do you if you do you if you come
[2:01:16] to me and say, "Hey, brother Al, there's
[2:01:17] this girl I want to marry and but she's
[2:01:19] atheist. She hates Christ. She she wants
[2:01:22] nothing to do with Christ." Do do you
[2:01:24] expect me to handle you as in Hey,
[2:01:28] that's fine. That's great. Go. You go
[2:01:30] for it, boy. Would you do that for your
[2:01:34] daughter? How would you handle it? My my
[2:01:36] my point is put yourself in the pastor's
[2:01:39] shoe and ask yourself how you would deal
[2:01:43] with you.
[2:01:44] Okay, be mature now, right? I agree
[2:01:48] there are some good and bad actors and
[2:01:50] there are some very bad actors out
[2:01:52] there. Pastors, ministers, church
[2:01:53] people. I agree with you. There are some
[2:01:55] of them who are terrible, but there's a
[2:01:58] lot of them who are good and who are
[2:01:59] trying their best.
[2:02:01] Then I want you to think about freeing
[2:02:04] yourself from the hurt. young people, if
[2:02:06] you've been hurt by them, you've been
[2:02:08] treated badly, write them a letter. Go
[2:02:12] talk to them. Don't be afraid. What's
[2:02:14] They're not going to bite you. They're
[2:02:15] not going to eat you up. What's the
[2:02:17] worst they could do to you? Tell you
[2:02:19] more bad words. Go and get the hurt out.
[2:02:23] Tell them, "You hurt me in the way you
[2:02:26] treated me. This is what you said about
[2:02:28] me. This is what your people have said
[2:02:29] about me, and you really hurt my
[2:02:31] feelings. If you were wronged
[2:02:34] and if you are wrong, if you were wrong
[2:02:37] in what you did, if you did something
[2:02:39] where you backslid, don't try to justify
[2:02:42] yourself, but admit to your errors, but
[2:02:44] say, "Listen, the way you treated me
[2:02:46] really hurt me." Go tell them you're a
[2:02:48] free agent. If you tell someone how you
[2:02:51] feel, the worst that could happen is
[2:02:53] they get more upset with you and you're
[2:02:55] good after that. You walk away. Your
[2:02:57] heart is free. You don't have an
[2:02:58] obsession. You're not sleeping with
[2:03:00] these people living rentree in your
[2:03:02] head. You deserve a happy life. You
[2:03:04] deserve a good life to find your
[2:03:07] happiness by your own choices. Do not
[2:03:10] live with hurt that causes depression
[2:03:12] and anger. Get it out of your system.
[2:03:15] Lastly,
[2:03:17] uh parents, if you have children who
[2:03:20] have been influenced by these people, by
[2:03:23] what they've seen online, I just want to
[2:03:25] tell you, even if they've left the
[2:03:26] message, it isn't too late. Do not
[2:03:29] listen to they were not seed in the
[2:03:31] first place. I want to tell you continue
[2:03:34] living sweetly with them. Do not
[2:03:36] criticize them. Do not hurt them more.
[2:03:38] Do not call them names. Live a real
[2:03:41] Christian life. Share with them your
[2:03:44] your scriptures that bless you. You
[2:03:47] don't have to shove the message down
[2:03:48] them or say just live real salty with
[2:03:51] them. Right? I believe that they
[2:03:55] rejected a message of a perception and
[2:03:59] not the real word. I believe they can
[2:04:02] still come back if they see the real
[2:04:05] message. What they have left is
[2:04:07] bananomism. And maybe you are at fault
[2:04:10] too. Maybe the church is at fault. But
[2:04:12] you have no reason to give up hope or to
[2:04:14] think, "Oh, they rejected the prophet.
[2:04:16] They're serpent seed." Don't do that.
[2:04:19] Don't do that. There is always hope. And
[2:04:20] Christ is the final judge of all things.
[2:04:24] So you just trust in him. There is hope,
[2:04:27] saints. May the Lord bless you. May the
[2:04:30] Lord be with you. I hope this gives you
[2:04:32] something to think about that this gives
[2:04:34] you some some uh zeal within you to
[2:04:38] press on. We are living in the greatest
[2:04:40] time. God has been among us in the in
[2:04:43] the message of the prophet. Do not be
[2:04:46] discouraged. Do not let this discourage
[2:04:48] you. God has already foreseen this. God
[2:04:52] knew this was going to happen. And you
[2:04:54] need to realize, you need to know who
[2:04:56] you are. And that there was a man sent
[2:04:58] from God to identify something that was
[2:05:01] meant for you in this day to see the
[2:05:04] coming of the Lord manifested in you
[2:05:07] personally. Everything that's coming
[2:05:09] against it is to prevent you from seeing
[2:05:11] this truth. Don't fall for it.
[2:05:15] That's not what it's about. Amen. You
[2:05:18] and I here are fellowshipping on the
[2:05:19] body, word of the son of man. That's
[2:05:21] what's it about. The Lord bless you.
[2:05:23] Have a wonderful evening. God be with
[2:05:25] you until we meet again. Amen.
