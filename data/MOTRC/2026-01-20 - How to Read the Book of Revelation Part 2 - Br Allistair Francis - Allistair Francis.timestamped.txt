[0:00] I greet you saints in the wonderful name
[0:02] of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is the 23rd
[0:06] of March 2022 and I'm happy to be
[0:10] sharing God's word with you this
[0:11] evening. Uh last week we started a new
[0:15] series how to read the book of
[0:18] revelations and we did a little
[0:20] introduction last week and uh if you
[0:23] remember this is to help people
[0:27] understand
[0:29] how to how to read and understand the
[0:32] book of revelations.
[0:34] So um this is part one, the introduction
[0:38] of the book and the blessing and I trust
[0:40] that it would be a blessing to you this
[0:42] evening.
[0:44] So our scripture reading obviously is
[0:46] going to be from Revelations chapter 1
[0:48] verse 1:3.
[0:51] But just to begin, let's revise that
[0:54] introduction. This series is to help
[0:57] read the book the right way. By saying
[1:00] that we understand that many people or
[1:03] we know that many people who read the
[1:05] book of revelation cannot make head or
[1:08] tail of what is going on and the amount
[1:11] of false doctrine, misinterpretation,
[1:16] false preaching and teaching that has
[1:18] occurred from this book is tremendous.
[1:21] It's it's too numerous to tell.
[1:25] One of the things we must uh highlight
[1:28] is that what influences your
[1:31] understanding when reading is mostly
[1:34] your background. Your background has
[1:37] trained your mind to comprehend things
[1:39] in a certain way.
[1:42] So what kind of backgrounds are there?
[1:45] There are cultural backgrounds. So if
[1:49] you have a certain type of culture of
[1:51] where you come from and that's just you
[1:54] know culture has got to do with how
[1:57] people react, what their mannerisms are,
[2:00] what their uh traditions are in that
[2:04] place, their dress codes, their manner
[2:07] of speech, um whether the tone of the
[2:10] city or the town or the village is
[2:13] easygoing or highly strong things. All
[2:16] those things have uh um
[2:20] sort of they add to the culture and when
[2:23] you come from those kind of backgrounds
[2:26] when you read the book of revelation it
[2:28] affects your understanding.
[2:31] Uh another background is your religion
[2:34] religious background is really serious.
[2:36] So you can imagine if you come from a
[2:38] very uh liberal religion obviously
[2:41] you're going to have a liberal approach.
[2:42] If you have a a studious religion,
[2:45] you'll come from your background will be
[2:47] a studious approach. Um so apart from if
[2:51] it if you were not in a religion or not
[2:54] as religious
[2:56] uh you have another problem. If you're
[2:59] educated that's a background. If you are
[3:02] not educated that's another background.
[3:04] you know in those cases you have
[3:06] educated people who look down on uh
[3:09] non-educated people and then
[3:11] non-educated people look down on
[3:13] educated people. So it's really quite a
[3:16] quite a thing because no matter what
[3:19] background you come from you have um
[3:24] uh opinions on yourself and on others
[3:28] and on what you read. And it's very
[3:32] notable
[3:34] for a person to admit his shortfalls
[3:39] where he comes from and admit that he
[3:42] has a bias that he is he has a uh a
[3:47] mindset that was controlling for a long
[3:51] time. So there's another background, a
[3:55] message background or a non-ssage
[3:58] background. What does that mean? You
[4:00] know, you can have been in the message
[4:02] and because you're in the message, you
[4:05] seem to have a certain type of boldness
[4:10] or uh courage that
[4:13] uh is actually a little bit wild because
[4:18] you can become somebody who just feels
[4:20] like you've got the right to interpret
[4:22] anything the way you want to because you
[4:24] seem to have the monopoly in the book of
[4:26] Revelation. And that's a dangerous
[4:28] background. And then there are non-ssage
[4:31] background which is somebody who who
[4:35] comes from a church where they didn't
[4:37] even bother with the book of Revelation.
[4:38] It was all about the Psalms, the
[4:40] Proverbs, love everyone, come to church,
[4:44] social gatherings, and nobody bothers
[4:46] with, oh, don't worry about the book of
[4:48] Revelation. It's just a lot of uh, you
[4:51] know, confusing stuff that's for the
[4:53] future. you know Jesus just wants us to
[4:56] love everybody and you know give our
[4:58] offerings and see to the poor and
[5:00] everything will be well that's another
[5:02] background you can imagine someone like
[5:05] that who starts reading the book of
[5:06] revelation immediately they start
[5:08] yawning because they feel it's not
[5:10] important
[5:12] then you have a false doctrine
[5:14] background it's clearly very um
[5:17] dangerous as well because these
[5:19] doctrines begin from the books of
[5:23] Ephesians from the gospels, from the
[5:26] Levitical
[5:28] uh uh books and uh doctrines begin
[5:31] there. And when doctrines dictate
[5:35] how a person must live, how a person
[5:37] must think, what the morality of a
[5:39] person is, then when you read the book
[5:42] of Revelation, of course, it changes
[5:45] your view. There you have a a stay with
[5:48] the ABCs background. That background
[5:51] says, you know, you'll make it to heaven
[5:54] if you just be good, do right, dress
[5:58] right, speak right, you know, and don't
[6:01] worry about all the deep things. Well,
[6:04] that's a background that's going to put
[6:06] you at a disadvantage when it comes to
[6:08] the book of Revelation because you're
[6:11] going to feel again like others that the
[6:12] book of Revelation is not as important.
[6:15] [snorts] If you have a legalistic
[6:16] background, dangerous one as well
[6:18] because you tend to feel like you are
[6:21] more studious. You feel like you are
[6:23] more intellectual, more intelligent,
[6:25] more able. Uh and that that feeling of
[6:29] overconfidence is really what gives you
[6:32] the wrong idea. uh fanatic background.
[6:36] That's dangerous as well because uh
[6:38] that's like somebody who turns
[6:41] everything into such a great m it's
[6:44] almost like you get a high from the the
[6:46] idea of events coming to pass. And you
[6:49] find these fanatics are the ones who
[6:52] everything every year is a sign. Every
[6:54] president of the United States is the
[6:56] sign of the end. Every pope is a sign of
[6:58] the end. Every situation that happens is
[7:00] a sign of the end. We've been hearing
[7:02] signs of the end for the last 50 years
[7:05] because of these kind of people and
[7:07] they've got no idea because God doesn't
[7:10] reveal it to them but they just claim
[7:11] everything is a sign. Uh and of course
[7:14] that's a dangerous background to have to
[7:16] read the book of revelation. Then there
[7:18] is surface level message background.
[7:20] That means people who just you know
[7:23] water baptism serpent seed godhead
[7:26] predestination
[7:28] and um cood and uh you know that's the
[7:32] message. So don't worry about you know
[7:36] um the seals. Don't worry about the
[7:37] thunders. Don't worry about the
[7:38] trumpets. Don't worry about the vials.
[7:40] The trumpets are to Israel. The vials
[7:42] are to the church. So why should we get
[7:44] into it? Uh so don't bother with those
[7:47] books of the Bible. All you need is, you
[7:50] know, Revelations chapter 1 2 3 4 6 is
[7:54] the seals. Uh, Revelations 8:17 seal.
[7:57] Revelations 10, which is the the mighty
[8:00] angel descending. And that's it, you
[8:02] know, and a little bit of the 21 where
[8:04] it's new heavens and new earth. Well,
[8:06] that's it. Nothing more than that
[8:09] surface level message background.
[8:12] Uh and these people are the ones who
[8:15] keep keep you going for like 60 years,
[8:18] you know, watch the Vatican, watch
[8:20] Israel, every single newspaper article,
[8:23] every single thing till the the the
[8:26] point is they even will send you fake
[8:29] news on the Vatican and Israel and be
[8:32] hyped up for a week, three days to a
[8:34] week and then it's dead again.
[8:37] So and you see the uh problem with all
[8:40] these kind of backgrounds because they
[8:42] produce a life that is not overcoming a
[8:46] life that is constantly under pressure
[8:48] life that is constantly recorrecting
[8:51] recorrecting and very very stressful. So
[8:54] then lastly there is this new
[8:56] generations these new generations which
[8:59] are the no clue about the message
[9:01] background.
[9:03] Sorry to say this but this is where we
[9:05] are today.
[9:06] My hope is to allow you to see that
[9:08] without the Holy Ghost, you cannot
[9:10] understand anything you read in the
[9:13] Bible. And if you do understand
[9:15] something in some way, more than likely
[9:18] your understanding is horribly wrong or
[9:21] misinterpreted.
[9:23] So, by the grace of God and by the
[9:26] leadership of the Holy Ghost, let's try
[9:29] to get through the first three verses
[9:32] today. And we'll start with Revelations
[9:34] chapter 1 and verse one.
[9:37] And it reads like this. The revelation
[9:40] of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him
[9:44] to show unto his servants things which
[9:47] must shortly come to pass. And he sent
[9:51] and signified it by his angel unto his
[9:55] servant John, who bare record of the
[9:58] word of God, and of the testimony of
[10:01] Jesus Christ, and of all things that he
[10:04] saw. Blessed is he that readeth, and
[10:09] they that hear the words of this
[10:11] prophecy, and keep those things which
[10:14] are written therein, for the time is at
[10:18] hand.
[10:20] Amen. The Lord add a blessing to his
[10:22] word. I'm so excited to be getting into
[10:24] this book. It's really something that
[10:25] just always excites me to read this book
[10:29] of Revelation. I find one of the first
[10:32] things to do when reading a chapter of
[10:34] the Bible is to break it down. Doesn't
[10:37] matter where it is from, whether it's
[10:39] Leviticus, Psalms, Proverbs,
[10:42] Ecclesiastes,
[10:44] uh any one of the prophets. If you read
[10:46] a chapter, I like to read the entire
[10:50] chapter. When people ask me a question,
[10:53] I like to read the entire chapter, break
[10:56] it down so I can see what the context is
[10:59] in the scripture. It's always the case
[11:02] that several verses in the chapter are a
[11:07] group of a particular theme or topic.
[11:10] For example, three verses may be
[11:13] speaking about a specific thing and then
[11:17] another few verses are of a different
[11:19] topic. In other words, they're speaking
[11:21] of something else. Now, often if it's in
[11:25] one chapter, these different topics, so
[11:28] let's say you have, you know, like 21
[11:31] verses and
[11:34] um maybe five verses speak on one topic,
[11:37] three verses on another.
[11:40] uh nine verses on another and one verse
[11:42] and another and and they it seems like
[11:46] all these different topics are in one
[11:49] chapter because they coincide somehow
[11:54] with an experience either a singular
[11:57] experience
[11:59] or they contribute to a larger theme or
[12:03] topic and that's the reason why they are
[12:05] in one chapter. All right. So the
[12:08] breakdown of the chapter verse 1 to3
[12:12] shows us the introduction of the book
[12:15] and the introduction of the author of
[12:18] the words and the scribe that means the
[12:21] writer who works under the author. In
[12:24] this case, the book is written by the
[12:27] the book is dictated or the words and
[12:29] the revelations are given by the Lord
[12:31] Jesus Christ himself and the scribe is
[12:34] actually John the disciple who later
[12:36] became an apostle.
[12:39] Verse four and five is what we call the
[12:41] salutation of the book that is to whom
[12:45] the book is written and in whose
[12:47] authority it is written. Uh um then
[12:51] verse 6-7
[12:54] uh shows worship acknowledgments
[12:59] um to the one from whom the revelations
[13:01] come
[13:03] um like praise right to the author or um
[13:07] of the book. Verse 8 shows an
[13:10] announcement
[13:11] a a certain specific word from the
[13:14] author himself. And verse 9 to 20 gives
[13:18] us the Patmas vision which is often uh
[13:22] the first Patmas vision often called the
[13:24] Patmas vision um which is the seven
[13:28] golden candlesticks and the sevenfold
[13:31] glory of the person of Christ.
[13:34] So this idea of breakdown of the chapter
[13:37] I learned from the prophet of the hour.
[13:39] He actually did quite a comprehensive
[13:41] breakdown of this chapter. If you read
[13:43] in the message uh the revelation of
[13:47] Jesus Christ
[13:49] uh priest Jeffsonville
[13:51] often called the ROJC series. This is
[13:54] 1960 the 4th of December paragraph 74 he
[13:58] says and now the contents of this first
[14:01] chapter the first verse
[14:04] it is really speaks for itself because
[14:07] it is the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[14:09] Second verse St. John the divine is the
[14:12] scribe and servant. Third verse, the
[14:14] blessings pronounced.
[14:17] Fourth through sixth verse, the salute
[14:20] or salute to the church. The seventh
[14:23] verse, the announcements. The eighth
[14:26] verse, the supreme deity of Jesus
[14:28] Christ. The 9th to the 20th verse, the
[14:32] patmas vision. And also the 14th and
[14:36] 15th verses describe his sevenfold glory
[14:39] of his person. Oh, it's beautiful when
[14:42] we see Christ in his sevenfold
[14:44] personages of his sevenfold beings of
[14:47] his personages in his glorious
[14:49] resurrection. Well, sevenfold beings of
[14:53] his personages. That's something to talk
[14:55] about. but basically speaks of the sort
[14:59] of ranks or characteristics of Christ
[15:04] that sets him apart from any other being
[15:08] on the on the planet any other prophet
[15:12] or wise man or sage or anything. Um so
[15:16] that's the reason why I believe the
[15:18] prophet would use such term the
[15:20] sevenfold beings of his personages not
[15:23] meaning that Christ is made up of seven
[15:26] different people but uh as you get
[15:28] through this the messages on the
[15:31] revelation of Jesus Christ series you
[15:33] get to see that. So from this breakdown
[15:38] we can further break down the first part
[15:41] of this chapter into the most
[15:44] significant part to the reader.
[15:48] The introduction of the book and the
[15:51] blessing of the book and that's what
[15:53] we're going to see in the first three
[15:54] verses or part of it. So it was very
[15:58] important in old times to give someone
[16:01] an introduction.
[16:03] People seem to
[16:05] need the the interest to read the book.
[16:09] And that interest came from knowing the
[16:12] importance of the person who wrote the
[16:14] book. Do you understand what I'm saying?
[16:16] In old days, if you brought a book to
[16:19] somebody, they were going to put it down
[16:20] somewhere and not read it. They needed
[16:22] an interest. And they would open the
[16:24] first page and look at the first page.
[16:26] And obviously, remember in those days,
[16:28] there were no pictures to draw
[16:30] attention. It was just words that was
[16:33] written. There was no color. It was
[16:36] black and white. And um so people seemed
[16:42] like I said to need interest to to open
[16:46] the book and to read it. So the interest
[16:49] would have to be grabbed in the first
[16:53] few words of the book. And one of the
[16:57] the most important things had to do with
[17:01] introducing the author
[17:03] and what the purpose of the book was and
[17:06] so on. So knowing the importance of the
[17:09] person who wrote the book and the reason
[17:11] for the book had to be stated
[17:14] immediately. Now you may not appreciate
[17:16] that today but back then reading was a
[17:19] very difficult slow process. You know
[17:22] all of us can read today. Well most of
[17:24] us can read today. you know, I think in
[17:26] South Africa a lot of us um everyday
[17:29] people can read,
[17:32] you know, fairly well. Uh so
[17:37] but and we can pick up newspapers, we
[17:39] read our phones. Um our children by the
[17:42] time imagine by the time our children
[17:44] are seven years old, they can already
[17:46] read a newspaper.
[17:49] And uh but think back to those days.
[17:53] Think back to 500 years ago. The
[17:56] majority of the world could not read. It
[17:59] was only educated men who could read.
[18:02] Most women could not read. Um so going
[18:06] back a thousand years, 2,000 years, all
[18:09] women could not read. Only men could
[18:11] read and only important men could read.
[18:15] So to read something was a very slow
[18:19] process. And then books were not mass-
[18:23] prodduced. So it was like a treasure for
[18:27] any man to have a book. And so if a
[18:31] parchment of paper or a book was or
[18:33] something was a document was written to
[18:36] that man because he didn't have many
[18:39] books to practice with. One page could
[18:42] take him a whole day just to read that
[18:46] book. I want you to understand why
[18:48] things were written the way they were.
[18:51] So reading was a very difficult slow
[18:53] process. So imagine if parchments came
[18:56] from John physically to the church of
[19:01] Ephesus
[19:03] and how long it would have taken for
[19:06] them to sort through the writings and
[19:08] the visions and to learn it in their own
[19:12] languages and so on. how long it would
[19:14] have taken for them to understand.
[19:16] Reading was a very difficult slow
[19:18] process and required an enormous amount
[19:20] of time to give such time. The
[19:23] introduction had better expressed the
[19:26] importance very well or else a book
[19:28] would be easily discarded. Remember in
[19:30] those days people were up at the crack
[19:32] of dawn and they were sleeping when the
[19:34] sun went down. They were not going to
[19:35] waste their time reading a book or
[19:37] something that wasn't important. So if
[19:41] if John sent a a book with writings that
[19:43] said, uh, well, I just want to describe
[19:46] some of my experiences on the aisle of
[19:48] Patmas, you know, um, well, barely
[19:51] anyone was going to read that. But if
[19:53] that introduction
[19:57] said things like it did say, well,
[19:59] that's when it grabbed the attention of
[20:02] the people.
[20:03] All right? So I trust we understand
[20:05] that. Let us go then phrase by phrase um
[20:09] through uh these verses. First three
[20:12] verses and we'll start with the first
[20:15] and most important phrase. Imagine that
[20:19] the revelation of Jesus Christ. What
[20:21] does that say to you? All right. So with
[20:24] every phrase we want to ask this
[20:26] question. What does this tell us? Okay.
[20:30] And uh so bear this in mind because as
[20:32] we go forward I'm not going to keep
[20:36] asking that question. What does
[20:37] [snorts and clears throat] this tell us?
[20:39] So the book of revelations
[20:42] firstly that phrase says the revelation
[20:45] of Jesus Christ. What does this tell us?
[20:47] It the first thing it tells us is it's
[20:49] not the revelations of John. Things were
[20:52] not revealed to John. Now if you link
[20:57] this with the last phrase of the first
[21:00] verse
[21:02] you will see that it was sent to John
[21:05] right remember that
[21:08] uh it says there uh the revelation of
[21:11] Jesus Christ and the last phrases say
[21:14] and he sent and signified it by his
[21:17] angel unto his servant John. Right? So
[21:19] it was sent to John. It was not the
[21:22] revelation of John. very important if
[21:25] you so we have to rule out that these
[21:29] were John's revelations. I know a lot of
[21:32] people call John the revelator and so on
[21:35] like he was the one revealing but he
[21:37] wasn't. He was the scribe. Revelations
[21:40] were that of Jesus Christ, the Lord
[21:42] Jesus Christ himself. If anything, John
[21:45] revealed nothing. He only recorded what
[21:48] was shown him. And truthfully, the way
[21:50] he wrote things out requires deeper
[21:54] understanding. It it it's like the
[21:57] revelations were given to him, he wrote
[21:59] them down, and now they require even
[22:01] more revelation.
[22:03] So, he didn't even really reveal
[22:05] anything. He just told us what he saw,
[22:08] how he interpreted what he saw, and he
[22:12] he just wrote down what he saw. So uh
[22:15] you can ask is this book the revelation
[22:18] of who Jesus is? But the Bible says
[22:22] although there is some of that in here
[22:24] like the sevenfold glory of his person
[22:27] later on in the chapter but this is more
[22:31] about the uncoverings of the work of
[22:33] Christ in the future. Let's read just
[22:37] two um little quotes on that. Now you'll
[22:41] find I because I want to save time and
[22:44] not labor it. I've left out the real
[22:46] chunks of the quotes. I want to just
[22:48] direct your attention to just two simple
[22:52] phrases in the quotes in Revelation
[22:54] Jesus Christ series. Paragraph 79 and
[22:58] paragraph 85. And he says and this book
[23:01] is not the uncovering of so much the
[23:04] person of Jesus Christ. uh and he says a
[23:07] few things but then the last part there
[23:09] he says but it is the revealing of the
[23:13] future of his works in his seven church
[23:16] ages that's coming on in paragraph 85 he
[23:20] says now in this great age that John saw
[23:24] these this revelation was given to him
[23:26] strictly to unveil the specific purpose
[23:29] of Christ what he would be and be like
[23:33] in every age So the first phrase the
[23:38] revelation of Jesus Christ is telling us
[23:40] that the book of revelation is a
[23:43] forewarning
[23:45] or and an awareness
[23:49] given to the church of things that were
[23:51] going to occur in the world and in the
[23:54] church as a result of the faith of God
[23:57] through Christ. We'll explain some of
[24:00] that. And so that's the reason we told
[24:02] you in the introduction last week that
[24:04] this elite book gives the map or the
[24:08] foresight of the events of the injection
[24:11] of the seed of Christ through the ages
[24:13] and the exact effects it would have on
[24:16] the world and the church. Right?
[24:17] Simplifying that it it's a description.
[24:22] It tells you exactly what will happen,
[24:25] what's going to happen, what will happen
[24:27] before, what will happen after
[24:30] uh any situation.
[24:32] And basically it tells you that these
[24:35] things are going to happen because
[24:37] Christ was introduced to some someone or
[24:41] a church or a part of the world. And
[24:45] what will happen just because he was
[24:47] revealed or he was the knowledge of who
[24:50] he was was brought to those people.
[24:53] It's almost like it's a pattern that
[24:56] will never fail. The book of Revelations
[24:59] accurately describes the pattern of
[25:01] effects and it will never fail to
[25:03] happen. It's a very important thing to
[25:05] remember because we'll we can look at
[25:08] the book of revelation and then map out
[25:10] our lives and see why things happen the
[25:13] way they did. Right? So having this
[25:16] means there is no reason to guess
[25:19] because it is all revealed. And I must
[25:22] add this in this revelation was given by
[25:25] visions to John. The reason this book of
[25:29] revelation requires further revelation,
[25:32] in other words, an ear to hear what the
[25:35] spirit's saying, is because it was
[25:37] written by a man 2,000 years ago who was
[25:40] of a different time and mind that we
[25:44] were not familiar with.
[25:46] So we would need a man of our time
[25:51] anointed with the same anointing to put
[25:54] us into the same visions so we can
[25:57] understand properly.
[26:00] The next phrase is which which God gave
[26:05] unto him. So the revelations of Jesus
[26:07] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[26:09] gave unto him, right? Which God this
[26:11] statement is saying which God gave unto
[26:13] Jesus Christ. And once again, this looks
[26:15] like perfect ammunition given to
[26:18] trinitarians to make their claim. This
[26:21] looks like the son didn't know the
[26:24] revelation and it was given to Jesus by
[26:27] the father. And that's not what this
[26:29] means at all. All right? So the proper
[26:32] understanding of this is you have to
[26:35] understand the dispensations,
[26:38] right? The dispensations, the
[26:40] understanding of those dispensations is
[26:41] required here. So the dispensation of
[26:44] the father was 4,000 years. That is the
[26:47] outpouring or unveiling or revealing of
[26:50] God as God above the people, the I am,
[26:55] the self-existing one, Jehovah.
[27:00] uh that
[27:02] uh part of the attributes of God was was
[27:06] ruling over the people through the ages
[27:08] of conscience which was from Adam
[27:10] through to Noah and Abraham and then the
[27:15] law came in after Abraham right up till
[27:18] Christ. So those two ages of conscience
[27:19] and law those were the dispensation of
[27:22] the father. So from there on from
[27:25] Christ, God purposed that this earth and
[27:30] his people should be redeemed by the
[27:34] manifestation of the son. That means uh
[27:37] the son would then reveal who God is
[27:39] from there on. Son of man, son of God,
[27:42] son of David manifestations. This was a
[27:44] new order of grace. This is why the name
[27:47] of Jesus was above every other name that
[27:50] God was known uh by. So this phrase was
[27:53] very important to state that this
[27:56] revelation is therefore from God
[27:58] himself. When the reader begins to read,
[28:01] he understands this is a revelation
[28:04] given by Jesus Christ and it comes from
[28:07] God himself. For those who at that stage
[28:10] were not certain of the deity of Christ,
[28:12] this these two phrases tell them that
[28:15] Christ was actually deity. The next
[28:18] phrase says to show unto his servants.
[28:21] What is show? Show means to reveal.
[28:25] Why was this revelation given to John?
[28:28] The purpose is so direct and clear. It
[28:32] is to be given to the servants of
[28:34] Christ. This is sounding the alarm of
[28:37] how important it is that ministers of
[28:40] the gospel embrace this book of
[28:42] revelations seeing it is uh the only
[28:46] book of the Bible actually given by
[28:49] Christ himself. All right. Matthew,
[28:50] Mark, Luke and John was not given by
[28:52] Christ. It was people. It was those
[28:54] disciples who recorded the life of
[28:57] Christ as they saw and heard it. But
[29:00] this is the only book where Christ
[29:02] actually dictates the very words, shows
[29:05] the visions,
[29:06] uh tells John what to do. This is
[29:09] actually the one book in the Bible which
[29:12] is given by Christ himself. So why is it
[29:16] given to the servants? That is those who
[29:18] are in the ministry, those who teach,
[29:20] those who testify, those who need to uh
[29:24] uh give this word out to the people,
[29:26] they need to know this. They need to
[29:28] know this book of revelation to be able
[29:30] to be more powerful in their witness of
[29:32] Christ. This book gives that ability.
[29:37] This is spoken in the first verses
[29:38] saints. That's what this phrase means.
[29:41] The next phrase says, things which must
[29:44] shortly come to pass. So this is the
[29:47] phrase that tells us it is uh shortly
[29:51] come to pass. That means things that are
[29:52] still going to happen. It is telling us
[29:54] that is making known future events which
[29:56] the church should take heed to pay
[30:00] attention to as significant. In other
[30:02] words, they should look at what is
[30:04] spoken of in the prophecies and realize
[30:06] that it is significant to the work of
[30:09] the son,
[30:11] right? The work of Christ and the
[30:13] interference of the enemy.
[30:16] All right. So, take heed to what is in
[30:19] the book. Uh, take heed to what comes to
[30:21] pass because it's important to know how
[30:23] to handle the purpose of Christ and to
[30:25] know what the enemy is going to be
[30:27] doing. Okay. The next phrase, he sent
[30:31] and signified it by his angel unto his
[30:35] servant John. Now, this is a great
[30:38] mystery, right? And I and I'm going to
[30:41] say this from myself. I find it
[30:43] intriguing because we have no idea about
[30:46] it. He sent and signified it by his
[30:50] angel unto his servant John.
[30:54] Everything you might hear about this is
[30:57] just speculation.
[30:58] So the best way is to stay as close to
[31:01] what the scripture says about it as
[31:03] possible.
[31:05] This first tells us that John was a real
[31:08] man of God. Right? These men would not
[31:11] even trust their own dreams and visions
[31:14] unless God signified it to them. That
[31:17] means you know John could have seen
[31:19] visions. He could have seen dreams but
[31:21] it was real to him so that he could
[31:25] subscribe it. He could he could write
[31:28] these words but to him he had to know
[31:32] that it came from God himself. And God
[31:34] confirmed it by sending an angel. It was
[31:37] then so it was vindicated. It was
[31:40] confirmed. It was signified with a
[31:43] second witness.
[31:45] It was made double sure because God sent
[31:48] this angel to him. So every good
[31:52] scholar, student of the scripture in
[31:55] that time knew that what it meant in the
[32:00] in the mouth of two witnesses, two or
[32:02] three witnesses, let everything be
[32:04] established.
[32:05] Or where there are where there are two
[32:08] or three gathered in his name, there I
[32:11] am in their midst. They understood what
[32:13] that meant that God only sanctions
[32:15] something when it is vindicated.
[32:18] God only sanctions something new by a
[32:21] vindication. Right? In this case, the
[32:23] visions to John were vindicated by an
[32:26] angel.
[32:27] Therefore, the angel was the
[32:29] vindication. The angel was the
[32:32] signifying. The angel was the sign.
[32:36] All right. In the message revelation to
[32:38] Jesus Christ paragraph of 112, it says,
[32:40] "And it was sent to and signified by his
[32:44] angel unto John." We do not know who the
[32:47] angel was. The Bible doesn't say who the
[32:50] angel was. But we know that it was a
[32:53] prophet because the Bible later said
[32:55] that I Jesus have sent my angel to
[32:58] testify of these things which must
[32:59] shortly come to pass. So this tells us
[33:02] that there was another man on the aisle
[33:05] of Patmas who was guiding John through
[33:08] these visions.
[33:10] Another man. Now which prophet could
[33:14] this be? If this man was a prophet,
[33:16] which prophet was he? We have no idea.
[33:19] There's no name given a more important
[33:23] person than John
[33:26] obviously because what did this man know
[33:30] more about the visions than John? What
[33:31] did this man actually do? Was he the
[33:33] one? How did he signify what God was
[33:36] revealing to John? So, we know for sure
[33:39] that John was seeing the visions. But
[33:43] what role did this man,
[33:47] this angel
[33:49] play in all of these things on the aisle
[33:51] of Patmas? Was this man Christ himself?
[33:54] Legitimate question. So, as it turns
[33:57] out, this man wasn't Christ. He was just
[34:00] a prophet. At the end of the book, where
[34:03] John is so overwhelmed by these
[34:05] revelations, he in inverted commas, he
[34:09] bows down to the angel. That means he
[34:11] was so amazed with this man. Now we know
[34:14] what bow down means. Doesn't mean
[34:15] physically he went down on all on on all
[34:18] fours or knees and hands and head to the
[34:21] ground. Bow down means to
[34:26] uh worship means to submit yourself to
[34:29] something. So that means John was so
[34:31] amazed with this man or the way in which
[34:34] this man had guided John that somehow
[34:37] John became fixated on this angel this
[34:39] prophet bowed down could mean that John
[34:42] became dependent on this man like John
[34:46] imagine the time of the revelation was
[34:48] ending and John was crying please don't
[34:50] go please don't leave me alone just stay
[34:52] with me you know what am I going to do
[34:54] without you so John could have been
[34:56] feeling hopeless now that this man had
[34:58] to leave him John's humanity was showing
[35:01] weakness. So this is what this angel
[35:05] said to him, right? Revelations uh 22
[35:09] verse 8-9, those of you who know it. And
[35:12] I, John, saw these things and heard
[35:14] them. And when I had heard and seen, I
[35:17] fell down to worship before the feet of
[35:19] the angel which showed me these things.
[35:21] Then said he unto me, "See thou do it
[35:24] not, for I am thy fellow servant, and of
[35:27] thy brethren the prophets, and of them
[35:30] which keep the sayings of this book,
[35:32] worship God." This is not here just to
[35:36] tell us. So listen, okay, we know from
[35:38] this scripture that this man or this
[35:41] angel was a man. It says, "I'm the
[35:43] fellow servant of thy brethren, the
[35:45] prophets." He didn't say, "I'm one of
[35:47] the archangels." He didn't say, "I'm a
[35:49] celestial being.
[35:51] So I, you know, things must have been so
[35:54] amazing to John for him to know who
[35:57] Jesus Christ was and yet to give such
[36:00] reverence to this man who was the
[36:03] vindication of these revelations,
[36:07] right? And yet this man
[36:11] identifies himself and says, "Hold on.
[36:13] I'm not him. I'm not Christ. I'm just
[36:17] one of your fellow servants. I'm one of
[36:19] the prophets. you keep uh who keep the
[36:22] sayings of this book, you worship God.
[36:24] So this is not here just to tell us what
[36:27] happened with John. I believe that this
[36:29] expresses a common occurrence when a
[36:31] true son of God brings revelation,
[36:34] real revelation to people. People will
[36:37] fall down before them. That means they
[36:39] will ascribe more importance to them
[36:42] than they should. People will make more
[36:44] of them than they should. Whether it's
[36:46] brother Brandham or some brother from
[36:48] overseas or brother Alistister from
[36:49] Durban, we are not to be uplifted above
[36:53] the one from whom this revelation comes.
[36:56] It is Christ who gives this grace to us.
[37:00] See to it that you bow down to God only.
[37:04] This is a warning to us ministers too to
[37:06] have the same character as this angel
[37:09] when teaching the book of Revelation.
[37:11] Just because we have this understanding
[37:13] of the book of revelation, we should not
[37:16] make it look like we have so much of
[37:18] importance that we have great importance
[37:21] above everybody else.
[37:24] Right? So the warning to us is do not
[37:28] let the people ascribe more importance
[37:31] to you above Christ. We'll come back to
[37:35] this in greater detail at the end of the
[37:38] series. uh but it is important to point
[37:41] it out. Now let's go to verse two. So
[37:44] the first phrase in verse two says who
[37:47] bear record. So this is speaking of
[37:49] John. Who bear record of the word of
[37:51] God. This gives the credentials of John.
[37:54] That means um why John was so important
[37:59] to be chosen to be the writer the scribe
[38:03] of this book. So it means it gives claim
[38:07] to John as one of the direct witnesses
[38:11] of Christ. He bare record of the word.
[38:13] Now not just direct witness of Christ
[38:16] but he was one of them who was the
[38:18] writers of the gospels of Christ. He was
[38:21] one of the writers the book of John. He
[38:23] was one of the writers of the gospels of
[38:25] Christ. This phrase specifically says
[38:28] when it says he who beare record of the
[38:30] word it says that he was a witness. You
[38:34] know, I I when I think about this, this
[38:36] is so,
[38:38] you know, gives you goosebumps. John
[38:41] actually heard
[38:44] that beautiful voice of the Lord Jesus
[38:46] Christ. He sat in the room and heard the
[38:51] word being spoken from the lips of our
[38:54] savior, from the vocal cords of the son
[38:58] of man. I don't know how many more
[39:00] different beautiful ways to say it, but
[39:03] he bare record of the word of God. Glory
[39:08] to God.
[39:10] And of the testimony of Christ. That's
[39:12] the second phrase. This phrase tells us
[39:15] that John was an eyewitness to all the
[39:18] acts and the life of Christ.
[39:22] And finally, in verse two, and of all
[39:25] things that he saw. That tells us he was
[39:28] not just a witness of Christ. Not just a
[39:30] witness of hearing the word. He was also
[39:32] an eyewitness of the lives of all others
[39:36] around Christ. He was an observer of the
[39:39] public at the time. He was an observer
[39:42] of the church of Israel at the time and
[39:45] Rome during the ministry of Christ. So
[39:48] this phrase along with the two before
[39:53] makes it certain to us that John was an
[39:56] absolutely worthy
[40:00] vessel
[40:01] chosen to receive this book of
[40:03] Revelation. Amen. That's verse two of
[40:07] this great important book. All right,
[40:09] let's get to the last verse, verse
[40:11] three, which I call the blessings. And
[40:15] it starts with blessed is he that
[40:18] readth. Now in the Bible, blessed is he
[40:23] is a phrase commonly referred to in the
[40:25] biatitudes of Matthew chapter 5. Blessed
[40:28] is he may not sound like much to you
[40:31] today because nobody speaks like that
[40:33] anymore, right? I mean, you don't go
[40:35] around saying blessed is he that listens
[40:37] to me. You know, nobody does that.
[40:39] Nobody talks like that today. You might
[40:42] look at the direct translation and think
[40:44] well the word blessed means happy. So
[40:47] happy is he who reads and understands.
[40:50] You know like it's it's so ridiculous
[40:52] that Christians look at this take it as
[40:55] face value like in the biatitudes where
[40:57] it says blessed are the poor [laughter]
[41:01] happy are the poor. That's that's not
[41:04] what it means. It doesn't the poor are
[41:06] not happy with the situation.
[41:09] What does it mean by blessed?
[41:12] Okay. When when you use that word
[41:15] blessed or or say blessed means happy.
[41:19] So happy is the man who reads and
[41:22] understands.
[41:23] You know that's wrong. Why? Because
[41:25] people don't get happy when they read
[41:27] the book of Revelations. This book
[41:29] speaks of judgments and sins and and
[41:33] vials and trumpets and wars. And people
[41:35] don't read this book and say, "Well,
[41:37] where's the popcorn?" And you know, uh
[41:40] where's the music behind it? and let's
[41:42] sit there and enjoy this book. Like, no,
[41:45] you know, they don't do that. This is
[41:48] not a book that makes you happy as in
[41:51] excited. Let's go out for a run now or,
[41:53] you know, let's go out and do something
[41:55] because I feel so incentivized by this
[41:58] book. It just makes me feel happy. No,
[42:01] that's not at all what it means, right?
[42:04] Well, not in the normal sense of happy.
[42:07] So the word blessed or blessed means
[42:12] something else. Think of when blessings
[42:16] began, right? In the Old Testament, when
[42:19] sons like Jacob or Esau went to their
[42:23] fathers and said, "Give me your blessing
[42:26] or bless me, father." It was to do
[42:30] something publicly
[42:33] to indicate that they would receive an
[42:36] honor that would set them above others.
[42:38] In other words, when Jacob went for the
[42:41] blessing of the father, what did he
[42:43] want? He wanted the advantage over Esau.
[42:46] The blessing if it was given to Jacob
[42:49] would give Jacob the advantage over
[42:52] Esau. What advantage? The advantage to
[42:55] the birthright, the advantage to the
[42:57] inheritance. Right? So in other words,
[43:01] an inheritance would be passed to them
[43:04] and because an action was made in the
[43:07] public, the blessing was an was a public
[43:10] display, an action, they would be the
[43:15] those who received this blessing would
[43:17] be respected because this public act
[43:20] proved it. Right? So
[43:24] what a blessing actually did was it gave
[43:28] an advantage to someone over others.
[43:33] Right? So if a man had seven sons and
[43:36] the father gave his blessing to one of
[43:38] them, it gave the advantage of that son
[43:41] over the others. Which means the others
[43:44] would have to respect him. They would
[43:47] have to honor him. they would have to
[43:50] understand that the majority of the
[43:51] inheritance belong to him. So the
[43:54] blessing gives an advantage and the
[43:58] secondary aspect of that. So because you
[44:01] have the advantage, it then brings you
[44:04] happiness eventually. Right?
[44:07] So it said blessed is he that readth.
[44:11] Now what is the word readth? You say
[44:14] well
[44:16] basically blessed is he that reads. It's
[44:19] not just read.
[44:21] It's showing the initiative
[44:24] of interest or the initiative to show
[44:27] interest. Blessed is he who shows the
[44:31] initiative to read. The interest to
[44:33] read. Right? And then the second phrase
[44:36] says, "And they that hear." So blessed
[44:40] therefore is are they that hear the
[44:43] prophecies, the words of this prophecy.
[44:46] That hear the words of this prophecy.
[44:49] here means to understand. So blessed are
[44:52] those who understand
[44:55] what is written in this book. So we'll
[44:57] come across this particular reference a
[44:59] lot in this book of revelation. This
[45:01] phrase he that hath an ear let him hear.
[45:04] This also indicates that if the the
[45:07] Bible says that it means it won't be
[45:10] easy for people to understand this book.
[45:13] Therefore those who understand they
[45:15] would be blessed. Right? The third
[45:19] phrase is and keep those things. So
[45:21] blessed is he that keeps those things
[45:24] which are written therein. This keep
[45:27] those things that doesn't mean okay so
[45:29] keep those things means preserve and
[45:31] observe. So how do you preserve and how
[45:34] do you observe the things in this book.
[45:36] Preserve does not mean keep a safe copy
[45:38] on your shelf for use when necessary.
[45:40] Right? To preserve and observe the
[45:43] sayings of this book is to be in
[45:46] constant fellowship with it. That means
[45:48] to be constantly talking about it,
[45:51] witnessing about it, learning more on
[45:53] it, asking questions on it,
[45:55] fellowshipping in it. Right? That's what
[45:58] it means to preserve or keep the sayings
[46:01] of this book. And the last phrase, for
[46:04] the time is at hand. Right? This was the
[46:07] direct warning that the prophecies were
[46:10] about to start being fulfilled. And so
[46:14] it was. Amen saints. So
[46:19] those are all the phrases
[46:22] of the first three verses
[46:26] of the first chapter of the book of
[46:29] Revelations.
[46:31] So once again, we're going to read those
[46:34] first three verses as it is written and
[46:37] then we're going to tell you what it
[46:39] should read like. Okay. So here it is
[46:42] again. The revelation of Jesus Christ
[46:46] which God gave unto him to show unto his
[46:49] servants things which must shortly come
[46:52] to pass. And he sent and signified it by
[46:56] his angel unto his servant John, who
[46:59] bear record of the word of God, and of
[47:03] the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of
[47:06] all things that he saw. Blessed is he
[47:09] that readeth, and they that hear the
[47:12] words of this prophecy, and keep those
[47:15] things which are written therein, for
[47:18] the time is at hand.
[47:21] Okay. So, we're now going to
[47:25] rewrite this
[47:28] in the way that it should be understood.
[47:32] And so, if you read this correctly, this
[47:36] is how it should read.
[47:40] Revelations 1 1:3.
[47:44] The comprehensive description
[47:47] of the effects and results of Christ
[47:51] being made known to the world, the
[47:53] church and to any individual
[47:57] which came into effect when the
[47:59] invisible father became the visible son
[48:03] was written in this book for the purpose
[48:06] of revealing this truth to all those who
[48:10] believe
[48:12] to be more effectual witnesses of the
[48:15] mystery of God. And it was revealed to
[48:19] the Apostle John and vindicated by a
[48:23] mysterious prophet who guided John
[48:26] through all his visions so he could
[48:29] rightly describe them. Verse two, John
[48:33] was chosen because he was a firsthand
[48:36] witness of the audible words spoken by
[48:39] the Lord Jesus in his three and a half
[48:41] year ministry. And John was a witness of
[48:45] the life and acts of the Lord Jesus in
[48:48] his ministry. And John was a direct
[48:51] witness of the effects of the life of
[48:54] Christ on the public, the church of
[48:57] Israel,
[48:58] the empire of Rome in Judea, and every
[49:02] believer that recognized the Messiah.
[49:06] And verse three reads like this.
[49:08] Every person, family or church, that
[49:12] takes a keen interest in this book and
[49:15] understands the prophecies and remains
[49:18] in constant fellowship and discussion on
[49:21] them, never forgetting to match them to
[49:24] events of the past, present, and future
[49:28] will have a great advantage over all
[49:32] others and will find respect and honor
[49:35] among believers and men of societ.
[49:38] society.
[49:41] So if you were reading the book of
[49:43] Revelations and you read the first three
[49:44] verses,
[49:46] that's what the first three verses
[49:48] should read to you like. Amen. Saints,
[49:53] God bless you. I trust that it will be a
[49:55] blessing. You can run through the notes
[49:57] again and and you know allow the Holy
[50:01] Spirit to reveal it to you. I know it
[50:03] can bring more questions, but more
[50:05] questions brings us more fellowship.
[50:08] So, may the Lord bless you until next
[50:10] week when we get to the next few verses
[50:13] of Revelations chapter 1. Glory be to
[50:16] God. May God be with you. Amen. in an A
[50:20] band.
