[0:02] Greetings, brothers and sisters, in the
[0:03] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[0:05] Jesus Christ. Good to be with you once
[0:08] again, sharing the word of the Lord.
[0:10] We're beginning a new series, the throne
[0:13] of God. And uh it's quite
[0:18] um
[0:19] I wouldn't say coincidental. I hope it's
[0:22] not, but I know our Sunday school has
[0:25] been dealing with this. And I find this
[0:27] an amazing uh series
[0:30] to do following the seals and the
[0:33] thunders because this brings a much
[0:36] better personal understanding to the
[0:39] word.
[0:41] So, we're going to take a few more
[0:43] Sundays looking into this. I know I've
[0:45] had this request to do this uh series
[0:48] some time ago and we'll take for an
[0:52] introduction
[0:54] um
[0:56] a statement where he chooses to place
[0:59] his name. So that's our title and we'll
[1:02] begin our reading from Hebrews chapter
[1:03] 12 and verse two.
[1:07] The Bible says, "Looking unto Jesus, the
[1:10] author and finisher of our faith, who
[1:12] for the joy that was set before him,
[1:14] endured the cross, despising the shame,
[1:18] and he sat down at the right hand of the
[1:21] throne of God." sat down at the right
[1:24] hand of the throne of God.
[1:27] All right. So, I know we um finished off
[1:30] a series on the thunders and um for some
[1:34] it might seem like an abrupt ending. You
[1:37] might even feel like, well, he didn't
[1:40] tell us what the thunders are. Well, if
[1:44] you did feel that way, then you probably
[1:46] were not listening well enough.
[1:49] But let's understand that these seven
[1:52] thunders are something that's got to be
[1:53] revealed to you personally. and we've uh
[1:57] explained as much as we could on it and
[2:02] it's endless
[2:04] what we can do with the the little time
[2:06] that we have with the message. Um it's
[2:11] never going to end the unfolding of the
[2:14] word to us. So this series that we're
[2:17] going to do is going to reveal more
[2:20] about those thunders to you. uh the
[2:23] Wednesday series that we are doing is
[2:24] going to reveal more. In fact, when we
[2:27] get to the end of the um types and
[2:29] shadows series, um I think our very last
[2:33] so uh services on that one is going to
[2:36] be uh something that will really seal it
[2:40] on what the thunders really are. So,
[2:42] we're looking forward to that.
[2:45] So, uh the throne of God, it's uh we're
[2:49] going to talk a little bit. We're going
[2:51] to
[2:53] um discuss this uh and set a good
[2:58] platform, a good introduction for what
[3:01] the series is going to be.
[3:04] And we're going to dispel a lot of
[3:08] uh fake belief.
[3:11] We're going to um uncover a lot of
[3:15] falsities that have been taught to us.
[3:18] And to properly understand this, you
[3:20] really have to look deep into yourself
[3:24] and have humility
[3:27] to remove all the things that you used
[3:29] to believe before.
[3:31] And I trust that you're going to see
[3:34] that once you do that, you're going to
[3:36] open your eyes to a completely different
[3:39] dimension. And that's the beautiful part
[3:42] of
[3:44] uh the this series which we can tell you
[3:48] uh the understanding is revealed to us
[3:50] but only because the seven seals have
[3:53] been opened to us. So this scripture
[3:56] Hebrews 12:2
[3:58] uh and I want to focus on that last
[4:00] phrase that says set down at the right
[4:03] hand of the throne of God. Now because
[4:06] of many scriptures like these
[4:09] and pictures drawn by artists there are
[4:12] numerous pictures all kinds you just
[4:14] have to search on the internet for
[4:17] throne of God and you will see the most
[4:19] amazing pictures
[4:21] um most people in this world both
[4:24] Christian and non-Christian have
[4:26] developed some idea of the throne of God
[4:29] especially from pictures that are drawn
[4:32] and uh from the way evangelical
[4:34] preachers preach and of course
[4:38] more than anything
[4:40] uh on the things the Catholic Church
[4:42] taught in the early
[4:44] um times of the dark ages.
[4:48] So people
[4:50] perceive that God sits in the heavens
[4:53] above
[4:54] that is in the universe somewhere on a
[4:57] great chairlike throne that is made of
[5:01] bright and shining light and that that's
[5:04] where he rules from. But this is
[5:06] absolutely not true. This is carnality.
[5:10] This is carnal thinking. It is not true.
[5:13] It never ever has been true.
[5:17] God has a throne. That's true. He
[5:20] desires to rule his people. That's true.
[5:24] But not the way we perceive it as a
[5:27] carnal man rules kingdoms. To begin to
[5:30] understand the throne of God, we have to
[5:32] study the scriptures and first
[5:34] understand whether God actually needed a
[5:37] place of ruling or a throne as we know
[5:40] it.
[5:41] So I've got to ask you that question. If
[5:44] God is God as we know him to be, why
[5:50] does he need a throne?
[5:53] And does he sit there all the time?
[5:56] [clears throat] Does he not move from
[5:57] there? Because this is all Roman and
[6:00] Grecian
[6:02] folklore and uh fables and myths.
[6:07] Why does God need a throne, a big chair
[6:11] to sit on, to rule from?
[6:16] Another question, why does God need to
[6:19] rule?
[6:20] According to everything we know of God,
[6:23] there's no reason for him to rule from a
[6:26] throne. He's created everything. He can
[6:30] see the beginning from the ending.
[6:32] There's nothing he needs to control
[6:34] because he's placed the nature of things
[6:37] in everything that he's created and
[6:39] everything that he's created will do
[6:41] exactly what it was meant to do.
[6:44] So by saying that God has to rule, what
[6:49] we are essentially saying is that things
[6:51] get out of hand and he has to keep
[6:53] stepping in to control it.
[6:56] Right? And that would be why he would
[7:00] need a throne. So if he has a throne in
[7:04] the universe somewhere,
[7:07] what we're saying is that the universe
[7:09] is
[7:11] has the ability to to step out of order
[7:14] and you know um and then he has to
[7:19] uh I don't know do things to bring it
[7:22] back into order. And you can see how
[7:26] silly that sounds because that's not the
[7:29] nature of God at all.
[7:32] So to begin to understand the throne of
[7:34] God, we've got to study the scriptures.
[7:36] Maybe it was something this idea of the
[7:40] throne, maybe it was something the
[7:41] religious leaders just made up to scare
[7:44] us. We need to know or else we could
[7:47] never truly know how to approach God.
[7:50] Now, we know that in Eden there was no
[7:54] visible throne. Adam never spoke of
[7:56] seeing a throne. There's no visible
[7:59] throne that Adam
[8:01] um
[8:02] or or
[8:04] that Adam, you know, had to do anything
[8:07] extra special to talk with God. There's
[8:10] there was no evidence of Adam having to
[8:14] bring a sacrifice or
[8:17] uh having to approach a certain place or
[8:21] a place of light.
[8:23] Nothing.
[8:25] God did not even seem to rule Adam in a
[8:29] sense of rule. God didn't have to
[8:33] uh be warding him here and there. He
[8:36] just set him in the garden by in a sense
[8:40] of telling him what to do. It just
[8:43] simply means that the nature was placed
[8:45] into Adam and Adam had to manifest that
[8:48] nature.
[8:50] But God seemed not to be separated from
[8:54] his son even though he didn't rule him.
[8:58] What the book of Genesis does show us is
[9:01] that he was not separated from his son
[9:03] while Adam was living on earth before
[9:06] the fall. So this either meant that
[9:10] there was no throne
[9:13] as we know it or Adam himself was very
[9:18] much a part of God because God would
[9:21] come and walk in inverted commas with
[9:24] Adam in the cool of the day. We know God
[9:27] was a spirit and and a spirit doesn't
[9:30] literally walk on two legs. So walk with
[9:34] Adam in the cool of the day. And now who
[9:36] can rightly know exactly what that meant
[9:40] from Adam right through to Abraham
[9:44] through Isaac and Jacob? We still do not
[9:47] hear of any place of ruling or throne.
[9:50] None of those great patriarchs said they
[9:53] saw the throne of God or they had
[9:56] visions of
[9:58] uh you know bright shining light and God
[10:01] sitting in a chair or angels all around
[10:04] him. Nothing of the sort.
[10:08] We do not see or hear of any place of
[10:10] ruling or throne until Moses. And that's
[10:13] where our study begins. we have to go to
[10:17] the book of Exodus chapter 25 and and
[10:19] verse 22 and also verse 43 uh chapter
[10:23] 29:43
[10:25] and chapter 26:30 we're going to read
[10:27] those three scriptures but for a
[10:30] subtitle now of the next section of our
[10:32] study I'm going to I'm going to say this
[10:35] what we have to see is a tabernacle a
[10:39] prophet and a priesthood all right a
[10:42] tabernacle a prophet and a priesthood
[10:45] very important Important thing for us to
[10:47] notice Exodus 25:22 the Lord saying
[10:50] there I will meet with thee and I will
[10:52] commune with thee from above the mercy
[10:53] seat from between the two cherubams
[10:56] which are upon the ark of the testimony
[10:59] of all things which I will give thee in
[11:01] commandment unto the children of Israel.
[11:03] Exodus 29:43
[11:06] and there I will meet with the children
[11:07] of Israel and the tabernacle shall be
[11:10] sanctified by my glory.
[11:13] Exodus 26:30, "And thou shalt rear up
[11:16] the tabernacle according to the fashion
[11:19] thereof which was showed thee in the
[11:22] mount."
[11:24] All right. So God asked Moses during the
[11:28] wilderness walk to construct a three
[11:31] court structure in which he had to set
[11:34] many things in order. So I've drawn a
[11:37] diagram for you.
[11:39] So, uh, what I would like you to do is
[11:42] if you could now take that diagram,
[11:46] uh, if you're following it in the notes
[11:48] or I sent it on your WhatsApp and if you
[11:53] open up the diagram, I want you to look
[11:55] at at it so that the most holy place is
[12:01] to the top of the page or north and the
[12:05] entrance to the outer court is south. So
[12:08] if you look at that diagram, what you're
[12:11] seeing is three chords, an outer court,
[12:15] an inner court, and a most holy place.
[12:18] Now when you look at this diagram, you
[12:21] also notice by a keen eye that there are
[12:26] three courts and there are seven
[12:30] um
[12:31] pieces of furniture or articles
[12:36] that make up um a part of this an
[12:40] important part of this uh tabernacle of
[12:43] Moses. So starting from the outside
[12:46] going in
[12:48] as you enter the outer court you see
[12:50] there's a four square brazen altar of
[12:53] sacrifice. Brazen meaning it's made of
[12:55] brass. Now you'll notice the there are
[12:59] two items in the outer court.
[13:01] A brazen altar and a brazen labor.
[13:05] The brazen labor sat at the door just
[13:08] outside the door of the inner court. And
[13:11] that was a labor or like a dish made of
[13:15] brass.
[13:17] And it had sanctified water that was in
[13:20] there. And the priests had to wash
[13:22] themselves with water, wash their hands
[13:25] and their feet before entering in. And
[13:28] the high priest had to be washed there
[13:30] at the labor
[13:32] uh from head to foot by the prophet.
[13:37] Then as you enter into the inner court,
[13:39] you will notice there on your left is
[13:43] the uh seven golden candlesticks and on
[13:45] the right of the inner court the table
[13:47] of showbread and then towards the end
[13:52] just before the veil you will see the
[13:55] altar of incense. So
[13:59] on the table of showbread were 12
[14:02] loaves of shoebre and uh the altar of
[14:05] incense of course would have burning hot
[14:07] coals in it upon which the ointment was
[14:11] um or the the the the perfume to create
[14:16] the smoke was put in. And then you have
[14:19] the veil which was a heavy very heavy
[14:21] set of badger skins
[14:24] in Solomon's temple. was so heavy they
[14:27] actually needed teams of oxen to pull
[14:29] it. That's how much they wanted it
[14:31] sealed. But here in the tabernacle of
[14:34] Moses, it was a tabernac it was a veil
[14:37] of badger skins. When you went beyond
[14:39] that veil of badger skins, there are two
[14:42] articles or pieces of furniture in the
[14:44] most holy place. And that was the ark of
[14:46] the testimony. And the ark of course was
[14:51] uh a box made of wood overlaid with
[14:54] gold. And inside the box was placed the
[14:57] ten commandments, the books, and above
[15:00] that was placed a seat called a mercy
[15:03] seat. And the mercy seat was made of
[15:06] gold. And on top of that were crafted
[15:10] cherubams that were facing each other.
[15:12] Cherubams are
[15:14] um angels
[15:17] or
[15:19] menl lookinging angels with wings, two
[15:21] wings which um two cover their eyes and
[15:26] two or or each each cherubam had a wing
[15:30] covering his eye and another wing
[15:32] covering the view to the mercy seat and
[15:35] uh they were facing each other. And then
[15:38] the last um article was the golden pot
[15:42] of mana which was brought in after the
[15:45] first mana fell. So three quarts
[15:50] uh and three dimensions to this this
[15:54] tabernacle and seven pieces of furniture
[15:57] in there. So very important to notice
[16:01] the pattern. Right? So God asked Moses
[16:05] during this wilderness walk to construct
[16:07] this three court structure in which he
[16:10] had to set many things in order
[16:13] as in Exodus 25:22 he told Moses that he
[16:17] would only meet with him personally at
[16:20] the ark of the testimony. Do you see
[16:22] that says I will commune with thee from
[16:25] above the mercy seat from between the
[16:27] two cherubams. So, so the shakina of
[16:30] glory would come down and rest between
[16:34] the cherubams. Moses would have to be in
[16:38] the most holy place standing before that
[16:41] and God would meet him there. Now, why
[16:43] would this happen? Because they' now
[16:45] left Mount Si and God needed a place of
[16:48] meeting with Moses
[16:51] and this is where he would meet with him
[16:53] where he was hidden from the public.
[16:56] Right? So he said he would meet with the
[16:58] people at the tabernacle. You'll see
[17:01] there in Exodus 29:43,
[17:03] he said he would meet with the children
[17:06] of Israel at the tabernacle. So that the
[17:08] the people could not get into the most
[17:10] holy place. They would come into the
[17:13] outer court or around the tabernacle and
[17:16] the the cloud would descend upon the
[17:18] tabernacle.
[17:20] So also it seemed that God showed Moses
[17:23] a vision of some kind in verse
[17:27] 43 or rather verse 30 of Exodus 26. He
[17:31] said you will build or rear up the
[17:33] tabernacle. You'll build the tabernacle
[17:35] according to the fashion which was
[17:37] showed thee in the mount. So it's like
[17:39] God gave him a vision of some kind uh of
[17:42] the design of the tabernacle. This tells
[17:44] us that God was particular about the
[17:46] order of this building. And we've got to
[17:48] ask ourselves why was he particular? Why
[17:50] so particular? Set out three courts.
[17:54] Uh and he was particular about how the
[17:56] outer court was built, how each u uh
[18:00] stick of gold was used or stick of brass
[18:03] or how each each piece of furniture was
[18:06] built to the detail.
[18:09] So Moses built it and the people
[18:11] worshiped God only here. They were not
[18:14] allowed to worship anywhere. Wherever
[18:17] they went in the wilderness, uh they
[18:19] could not stop at some tree and pray to
[18:22] him. They could not stop anywhere. They
[18:24] had to be here at this tabernacle.
[18:28] And wherever they went in the wilderness
[18:31] and it was time to cross over Jordan for
[18:33] Moses ministry to end, um Moses built
[18:38] it. The people worshiped God only here,
[18:41] right? And when they reached across
[18:43] Jordan, they had to bring this
[18:45] tabernacle to a place of course we know
[18:47] called Shiloh. Now notice in the
[18:50] wilderness, God's throne was the
[18:53] tabernacle
[18:55] wherein the ark was kept. Now this is
[18:58] the fascinating part right here was the
[19:01] tabernacle but his godhead
[19:05] or how he chooses to reveal himself.
[19:09] That's what Godhead is. How he chooses
[19:13] to reveal himself. Okay. So, here's a
[19:16] tabernacle, right?
[19:19] But how he chooses to reveal himself was
[19:22] made up of a pillar of fire, a pillar of
[19:25] cloud, Moses, Aaron, and the priesthood.
[19:31] Right? Five things here. Pillar of fire
[19:34] which descended into the most holy
[19:36] place. a pillar of cloud which covered
[19:38] the entire tabernacle, particularly the
[19:42] door of the tabernacle. When Moses was
[19:44] inside, the cloud descended to cover the
[19:48] door and the the pillar of fire was
[19:50] inside the most holy place. So from the
[19:54] tabernacle, it's what I'm trying to say
[19:56] to you is you have this tabernacle which
[19:59] is a thing that does not move. It's just
[20:03] it's planted there. It's it's standing
[20:05] there put together. Nothing moves,
[20:08] right? It's like uh a functioning thing
[20:13] with unmoving
[20:15] uh objects.
[20:17] But what makes this tabernacle alive is
[20:20] the pillar of fire, the pillar of cloud,
[20:23] Moses, Aaron the high priest, and the
[20:27] priests, the Levitical priests that move
[20:29] within. So that what we find if you can
[20:32] imagine it as if you are you have a
[20:35] bird's eyee view of this tabernacle
[20:38] the moving pieces are the pillar of fire
[20:41] pillar of cloud Moses Aaron and the
[20:43] priesthood
[20:45] that's the godhead of this tabernacle so
[20:49] notice this pattern how beautiful it is
[20:52] right a tabernacle
[20:55] or rather uh a tabernacle a prophet and
[21:00] a priesthood.
[21:02] Now, we're going to look at a
[21:04] tabernacle, a high priest, and a
[21:06] priesthood. Deuteronomy 12:10-14
[21:11] says, "When you go over Jordan, dwell in
[21:14] the land which the Lord your God giveth
[21:17] you to inherit, and when he giveth you
[21:19] rest from all your enemies round about,
[21:22] so that you dwell in safety.
[21:25] Then there shall be a place
[21:29] which the Lord your God shall choose to
[21:32] cause his name to dwell there. Saints,
[21:35] focus on those words. There shall be a
[21:37] place which the Lord your God shall
[21:40] choose to cause his name to dwell there.
[21:43] Fither shall you bring all that I
[21:45] command you, your burnt offerings, your
[21:46] sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave
[21:48] offering of your hand, and all your
[21:50] choice vows which you vow unto the Lord.
[21:52] And you shall rejoice before the Lord
[21:54] your God, ye and your sons and your
[21:55] daughters, and your men's servants, and
[21:57] your maid servants, and the Levite that
[21:59] is within your gate. For as much as he
[22:01] hath no part, nor inheritance with you.
[22:04] Take heed to thyself that thou offer not
[22:06] thy burnt offerings in every place that
[22:08] thou seeest, but in the place which the
[22:11] Lord shall choose in one of thy tribes,
[22:14] there thou shalt offer thy burnt
[22:16] offerings, and there thou shalt do all
[22:18] that I command thee. So God was going to
[22:20] choose a permanent place in the land of
[22:22] Israel. Now that the children of Israel
[22:25] were no longer traveling. So this
[22:27] scripture,
[22:29] so notice in the wilderness on the move,
[22:31] it was a tabernacle, a prophet, and a
[22:34] priesthood. When you get into the
[22:36] promised land, there's no more a
[22:38] prophet.
[22:40] There's a tabernacle, a high priest, and
[22:42] a priesthood. Right? That is they get to
[22:45] Shiloh. The tabernacle is set up in
[22:47] Shiloh. That was the place God chose to
[22:50] place his name. Right? It remained until
[22:54] Jerusalem was built and David's kingdom
[22:57] was set up. Right? Now, they were
[22:59] instructed to worship or sacrifice
[23:02] nowhere else. Verse 13 and 14 says,
[23:05] "Don't even think about offering burnt
[23:08] offerings in any place that you see it."
[23:11] This is the only place, Shiloh. That's
[23:14] the place the Lord has chosen to place
[23:16] his name to cause his name to dwell. And
[23:19] this is going to be chosen among one of
[23:21] the tribes uh or or or one of the land
[23:25] of one of the or the land of one of the
[23:28] tribes. And that's where I'm going to
[23:31] set up this tabernacle and that's where
[23:33] you're going to offer your offering.
[23:35] That place chosen of God was called
[23:37] Shiloh and it remained until Jerusalem
[23:40] was built and David's kingdom was set
[23:42] up. But for the time being, the throne
[23:45] was the tabernacle in Shiloh, wherein
[23:48] the ark was kept, and the godhead now
[23:52] was made up of the high priest and the
[23:54] priesthood until Shiloh became tainted
[23:58] by a corrupt godhead. If you can
[24:00] remember, um, by the time Eli came in
[24:05] and, uh, then God had brought in another
[24:08] major prophet, which was Samuel, to set
[24:10] up a new throne. and godhead. He brings
[24:14] back a prophet to create to bring back a
[24:16] new godhead. Right? And then Samuel
[24:19] eventually anoints David. So watch how
[24:23] the Godhead is changing having the same
[24:26] tabernacle.
[24:28] Amen.
[24:30] So now you have
[24:35] uh under David he desires to create or
[24:38] to build a temple. He desires to move
[24:43] the the throne of God away from Shiloh
[24:47] and he wants to build a temple. Of
[24:48] course, God stops David
[24:51] and allows Solomon to build the temple
[24:53] in Jerusalem. Now, watch what happens.
[24:56] So, the throne of God now on earth
[24:59] becomes a temple, a city, a king,
[25:04] prophets, and a priesthood. Let's read 2
[25:08] Chronicles 6 1-11.
[25:11] Then said Solomon, the Lord had said
[25:13] that he would dwell in the thick
[25:15] darkness, but I have built a house. Now,
[25:18] the Lord dwell in thick darkness. What
[25:19] does that mean? That doesn't mean God
[25:21] lives in darkness. That means God lives
[25:23] in a place that is unknown, unrevealed.
[25:27] Uh a place where he is too mysterious to
[25:30] be known. Verse two, but I have built an
[25:34] house of habitation for thee, a place
[25:36] for thy dwelling forever. And the king
[25:38] turned his face and blessed the whole
[25:40] congregation of Israel. All the
[25:42] congregation of Israel stood. And he
[25:45] said, "Blessed be the Lord God of
[25:46] Israel, who his who hath with his hands
[25:49] fulfilled that which he spake with his
[25:51] mouth to my father David, saying, Since
[25:53] the day that I brought forth my people
[25:55] out of the land of Egypt, I chose no
[25:58] city." Notice that I chose no city.
[26:01] right since the time that he came out of
[26:04] Egypt. In other words, S Solomon is
[26:07] saying, but now he's choosing a city.
[26:09] And we'll read that. I chose no city
[26:11] among all the tribes of Israel to build
[26:13] an house in that my name might be there.
[26:16] Neither chose I any man to be a ruler
[26:19] over my people Israel. But verse six, I
[26:23] have chosen Jerusalem that my name might
[26:27] be there and have chosen David to be
[26:31] over my people. So Solomon is showing
[26:34] how the throne is moving, how it is
[26:37] changing
[26:39] from a tabernacle in the wilderness to
[26:41] one at Shiloh. And now God has chosen a
[26:44] city, Jerusalem, and a lineage
[26:49] of David. Verse 7. Now it was in the
[26:52] heart of David my father, I'm reading,
[26:55] to build an house for the name of the
[26:56] Lord God of Israel. But the Lord said to
[26:59] David my father, for as much as it was
[27:00] in thine heart to build an house for my
[27:02] name, thou did well in that it was in
[27:05] thine heart, notwithstanding, thou shalt
[27:06] not build a house, but thy son shall
[27:09] come forth out of thy loins, and he
[27:11] shall build a house for my name. The
[27:13] Lord therefore had performed his word
[27:15] that he had spoken. For I am risen up in
[27:18] the room of David my father. This is
[27:20] Solomon saying, I am come up in the
[27:23] place of my father David.
[27:26] And I'm set on the throne of Israel as
[27:28] the Lord promised and have built the
[27:30] house for the name of the Lord God of
[27:32] Israel. And in it I have put the ark
[27:35] wherein is the covenant of the Lord that
[27:37] he had made with the children of Israel.
[27:39] So the spirit of God saints rested here
[27:42] for many years. God ordained a new
[27:45] priesthood and new worship. The throne
[27:49] was now the temple of Solomon.
[27:52] And the Godhead was made up of the
[27:55] kingdom of Judah, which is the lineage
[27:58] of David. The priesthood and minor
[28:01] prophets that were to guide the lineage
[28:04] of David, right? How do we know this?
[28:07] you know that David himself actually
[28:10] went into this this uh tabernacle where
[28:14] prior to that no son of Judah was able
[28:18] to go into the tabernacle and eat the
[28:21] showbread.
[28:23] So you find that it was this throne
[28:27] itself was changing because now it was
[28:30] it moved past a prophet and priesthood
[28:35] uh [clears throat] in Shiloh.
[28:38] It moved from a high priest and a
[28:40] priesthood. Now it's a city Jerusalem,
[28:43] a temple,
[28:46] a king and prophets, right? High priests
[28:50] and prophets. So it's it's changing. The
[28:54] throne was the temple of Solomon and the
[28:56] Godhead was now changed. Now first Kings
[29:00] 9 and3
[29:02] and the Lord said unto him
[29:04] um I have heard thy prayer and thy
[29:06] supplication that thou was made before
[29:08] me. I have hallowed this house. Hallowed
[29:12] means I have made it holy. That means
[29:15] I've sanctified it. That means I've
[29:17] consecrated it. And that means I have
[29:20] set I have agreed I've sanctioned I've
[29:23] set this house aside for my purpose. So
[29:28] I have hallowed this house which thou
[29:30] hast built to put my name there forever.
[29:34] Now forever is not eternity. Forever
[29:37] means a very long period of time.
[29:42] and mine eyes and mine heart shall be
[29:46] there perpetually.
[29:49] So it seemed God was pleased with this
[29:51] house that Solomon built. He said such
[29:54] words to Solomon to show that his spirit
[29:56] would remain here for a long time.
[30:00] Amen. First Kings 11:36.
[30:03] and unto his son will I give one tribe
[30:07] that David my servant may have a light
[30:10] always before me in Jerusalem the city
[30:14] which I have chosen to put my name
[30:16] there. So we're reading these scriptures
[30:18] to show you that God
[30:22] uh
[30:23] made this this tabernacle in the
[30:25] wilderness
[30:27] uh to put his name there. And we we've
[30:30] got to understand what that means. What
[30:31] does it mean that God put his name
[30:33] there? All right. So
[30:37] now he he says in first kings 11:36,
[30:40] I've chosen Jerusalem, the city which I
[30:42] have chosen to put my name there. So he
[30:44] was also pleased to make Jerusalem
[30:47] visible to the world that it was the
[30:49] city of the one true God. Many people of
[30:52] that day saw the power of God in
[30:54] Jerusalem. And therefore we've had so
[30:56] many wars over Jerusalem. We've had the
[31:00] Muslims, the Christians, and the Jewish
[31:02] people constantly fighting for hundreds
[31:05] of years over Jerusalem. Overthrowing
[31:08] it, burning it down, taking over it, you
[31:12] know, constantly for the last, well,
[31:14] several hundred years. That's what's
[31:16] been going on in Jerusalem.
[31:19] So, let's read Nehemiah 1 and:9.
[31:24] But if you turn unto me and keep my
[31:26] commandments and do them, though they
[31:29] were of you cast out unto the uttermost
[31:32] part of the heaven, yet will I gather
[31:34] them from then, and will bring them unto
[31:37] the place that I have chosen to set my
[31:40] name there.
[31:43] So God hallowed or sanctified Solomon's
[31:46] temple as the place of rulership.
[31:49] That means God made a public show to
[31:52] state that he set aside that place for
[31:56] his service. By doing this, he also
[32:00] hallowed Jerusalem as his holy city.
[32:05] This is why all worshippers of Israel
[32:07] had to travel to the holy city to make
[32:09] sacrifices
[32:11] uh pil which they call pilgrimages. And
[32:13] in fact, for many Christians, they
[32:16] believe they've got to make pilgrimages
[32:18] to Jerusalem.
[32:19] Now, when they were in captivity to
[32:22] Babylon, he promised to gather the
[32:24] people back to where his name was.
[32:28] Right? So, here's the understanding.
[32:32] What did it mean where his name was?
[32:35] Now, I've dealt with this several times
[32:37] in different series, so a lot of you may
[32:40] know what this means.
[32:42] So the name of God for any day
[32:47] is the true revelation or the knowledge
[32:50] of God for that day. So I want to tell
[32:53] you for those of you who have never
[32:56] uh heard me speak on this before, the
[32:59] name of God is not Jehovah or Jesus or
[33:05] Elohim
[33:06] or
[33:08] El Shadai.
[33:10] Those are Jewish words. Jesus is a
[33:13] Jewish word. There's a revelation of
[33:16] that, right? Jesus means Jehovah savior.
[33:20] Jehovah means God dwelling with his
[33:23] people. El Shadai means the breasted one
[33:28] or the nourisher or almighty God.
[33:32] Elohim, the self-existing one. Ela
[33:35] Elohim.
[33:36] Uh, Elohim was not even a Jewish word.
[33:40] Elohim was a Canaanite word. Elohim is
[33:44] the plural of God. It means gods. Um,
[33:49] and so when Abraham got to Canaan, he
[33:54] heard the Canaanites using the word
[33:56] Elohim for their gods. So that's where
[34:00] it came from. And and he adopted the
[34:03] Canaanite language. And there therefore
[34:06] we've got this word Elohim. But God
[34:10] doesn't need a singular name or two
[34:13] names or three names. Jehovah is not the
[34:17] name of the father.
[34:19] And yet we know it is. But that doesn't
[34:21] mean the father has one name. If that
[34:26] was so, he would have told Moses at the
[34:28] burning bush, "My name is Elohim." But
[34:30] he said, "I am that I am." What does
[34:32] that mean? Right? So when we talk about
[34:37] the name of God and when when God says
[34:41] the place where I want to where I choose
[34:44] to place my name. Right? So this is
[34:47] important. The name of God is the
[34:50] revelation or the knowledge of God for
[34:53] that day. So when he says
[34:56] uh I will choose a place to to place
[35:00] where my name can dwell what God is
[35:03] essentially saying is I am going to
[35:06] choose a place from where I can reveal
[35:10] myself where I can make myself known
[35:14] from right so that's what a throne is a
[35:17] throne is a place where God's name can
[35:20] be identified where where the revelation
[35:24] of who God is can be seen, can be
[35:27] understood, where the revelation of God
[35:30] for that day can be known. Right? So
[35:33] Solomon's temple lasted only until that
[35:38] godhead started becoming corrupted
[35:40] again. Right? So what we're saying is
[35:44] you have a tabernacle
[35:46] in the wilderness. The Godhead of their
[35:50] tabernacle is responsible for revealing
[35:53] the nature of God, the purpose of God,
[35:57] the the the
[35:59] reputation of God for that time. Who God
[36:03] is to the people for that time. And who
[36:06] God was to the people in the wilderness
[36:09] was revealed by the pillar of fire, the
[36:12] pillar of cloud, Moses, Aaron, and the
[36:15] priesthood. They were that was the
[36:18] components of the godhead
[36:21] of that tabernacle. Right? So that's
[36:23] what the godhead is. The godhead is that
[36:26] which reveals who god is in that
[36:30] specific time. So Solomon's temple
[36:33] lasted only until the godhead of
[36:36] Solomon's temple started becoming
[36:39] corrupt. Now this time each king
[36:43] remember Solomon's temple operated by a
[36:45] king a king priesthood and minor
[36:49] prophets.
[36:51] Now this time each king began to become
[36:53] increasingly evil which which shows us
[36:55] and many many times even the high priest
[36:58] became evil. You remember in the time of
[37:00] David, Abia the high priest began to
[37:04] rebel
[37:06] against David when he wanted Solomon to
[37:09] to become uh king. Abia was uh plotting
[37:13] to have Adonijah become king. So the
[37:19] priesthoods um the kings the prophets
[37:22] they all became a lot of them became
[37:24] evil and they compromised the holiness
[37:27] of the city and the temple.
[37:31] So for this cause
[37:33] God allowed Jerusalem and that temple to
[37:37] fall into the hands of men. He now had
[37:40] to move his name to a place where it
[37:42] could no longer be corrupted by a carnal
[37:46] godhead.
[37:48] Right? Understand? So let's read 2
[37:51] Chronicles 6 and verse 5. He says,
[37:53] "Since the since the day that I brought
[37:56] forth my people out of the land of
[37:57] Egypt, I chose no city among all the
[38:00] tribes of Israel to build an house in
[38:03] that my name might be there. Neither
[38:05] chose I any man to be a ruler over my
[38:10] people. He was saying until David. So
[38:14] now
[38:16] neither chose I any man to be a ruler.
[38:20] Can you see that ruler throne kingdom?
[38:24] So now let's talk about a man. We're
[38:26] moving away from tabernacle in the
[38:28] wilderness,
[38:29] tabernacle at Shiloh,
[38:32] temple of Solomon, and now it moves to a
[38:36] man. When the kings failed, Jerusalem in
[38:40] captivity
[38:43] uh went to captivity to heathens. The
[38:45] temple was desecrated by a corrupted,
[38:49] divided priesthood.
[38:51] God had to place his name elsewhere.
[38:54] All right? So how do we know this? John
[38:57] 5:43 this is Christ saying I come in my
[39:02] father's name.
[39:05] Now what does that mean? Does that mean
[39:07] mean the father's name is Jesus? His the
[39:11] son's name was Jesus. But what was Jesus
[39:15] saying by that statement? I come in my
[39:18] father's name. Right? He said I come in
[39:21] my father's name and you receive me not.
[39:23] If another shall come in his own name,
[39:25] him you will receive.
[39:28] So God chose to place his name in a man
[39:33] called Jesus Christ. Everything in the
[39:36] New Testament by the example of Christ
[39:38] shows us that a man can be the temple of
[39:42] God, the tabernacle of God, and the
[39:46] Godhead can be revealed in that man.
[39:51] So in other words, by Christ standing
[39:54] there, he showed us that every man can
[39:57] be a tabernacle and the Godhead would
[40:00] have to be with that tabernacle to show
[40:03] that God's name is placed there. Amen.
[40:07] And amen. Notice the scriptures. John
[40:10] the Baptist points out the tabernacle,
[40:13] the vessel. He says, "Behold the lamb of
[40:15] God." That's a public declaration. The
[40:18] prophet gives a public declaration of
[40:21] the tabernacle. Behold the lamb of God.
[40:24] But a voice from heaven points to Jesus
[40:28] saying, "This is my beloved son."
[40:31] Another public declaration.
[40:34] Right? In other words, this is where I
[40:36] choose to place my name. John the
[40:39] Baptist says, "There's the tabernacle."
[40:41] The voice from heaven says, "This is
[40:43] where I place my name."
[40:45] Colossians 2:9 says, "In him that is in
[40:49] Christ dwells the fullness of the
[40:52] Godhead bodily." So what you have is a
[40:55] tabernacle or a temple, a body, a
[40:59] functioning body and in him dwells the
[41:03] Godhead, right? So what is the Godhead
[41:07] in this aspect
[41:10] in the temp the temple or tabernacle of
[41:12] Jesus Christ? What is the godhead? Not
[41:15] just father, son and holy ghost in a
[41:17] man. He Christ was watch it. Son of man.
[41:23] What is son of man? Prophet. Son of God.
[41:26] What is son of God? Priest.
[41:29] Son of David. What is son of David?
[41:32] King. So in other words, in that
[41:35] tabernacle you had prophet, priest, and
[41:39] king.
[41:41] similar pattern to the Old Testament uh
[41:44] temples or tabernacles. And this
[41:46] prophet, priest, and king was the order
[41:49] of Mechisedc.
[41:51] In other words, all the fullness of the
[41:54] Godhead was in the sun.
[41:58] Son of man, prophet, son of God, priest,
[42:01] son of David, king. So, what do we have?
[42:04] A tabernacle and a godhead. That's where
[42:07] God's name is revealed. In other words,
[42:11] that's where the true revelation of God
[42:13] can be seen.
[42:15] Amen. But then Colossians 2:10 says this
[42:20] amazing statement. So Colossians 2:9
[42:24] said, "In him dwells the fullness of the
[42:25] Godhead bodily." Verse 10 says, "And you
[42:29] are complete in him
[42:33] which is the head of all principality
[42:35] and power." So Christ was supposed to be
[42:40] the beginning of the new throne of God.
[42:43] Right? You believe that Christ was
[42:46] supposed to be the beginning of the new
[42:48] throne of God. He came to bring forth
[42:51] the new throne of God. He was the
[42:54] beginning, right? He said he came to
[42:58] bring forth many sons like unto himself,
[43:01] many brethren like unto himself. He set
[43:04] up the church and purposed the church to
[43:08] build the new temple and the new
[43:11] godhead.
[43:12] Right? Brother was anointed in diverse
[43:15] ways to show us what this new throne and
[43:19] godhead was such that his ministry
[43:21] seemed to rebel against all carnal
[43:24] understandings.
[43:26] Right? So we in in the services to come,
[43:29] we're going to see uh all of these
[43:32] things. We're going to get into the new
[43:33] temp, the new temple, the new gonehead.
[43:36] We're going to have a look at all this.
[43:39] I know it may seem uh strange to you
[43:42] because most people just don't
[43:44] understand what godhead even means. They
[43:48] just assume godhead is father, son, and
[43:50] holy ghost. And who knows what that
[43:51] means? They just assume that's trinity
[43:54] versus, you know, oneness and so on. No,
[43:58] Godhead is a word that means something,
[44:04] right? It means the components that make
[44:08] up
[44:09] something that All right. So, I know
[44:12] this I've done this in the Godhead
[44:14] series, but just to give you a quick
[44:15] understanding, the original word for
[44:18] godhead was godhood,
[44:21] right? Godhood.
[44:24] What does godhood mean? All right. So if
[44:27] you take words like brotherhood,
[44:29] neighborhood, what makes up a
[44:32] brotherhood, it's many components. It's
[44:35] components, right, of of different
[44:37] brothers which form a brotherhood or a a
[44:42] unity, right? So you're going to need
[44:45] specific components to make up a
[44:47] brotherhood. When you talk of
[44:48] neighborhood, you can't be one house in
[44:51] your road and call yourself a
[44:53] neighborhood. No, that's just you. But
[44:55] if you have many houses there, many
[44:57] families living in your street, you can
[45:00] call that a neighborhood because that's
[45:02] made up of many components of different
[45:04] people and it's called a neighborhood.
[45:06] So the original word was godhood.
[45:10] Over time in the translation, it was
[45:12] changed to godhead uh because it it was
[45:15] spoken of as being the head of the body.
[45:19] So what does this mean? What is godhood?
[45:22] Godhood is the combination of the
[45:24] components that make him God. Why does
[45:28] he need components to make him God? He
[45:31] is God already. Now, of course, yes, he
[45:35] is God. But
[45:37] Jesus Christ is not God to the Hindus.
[45:40] Why is he not God to the Hindus? Because
[45:42] they don't recognize him as God. Uh to
[45:45] the Muslims, he's just a prophet. He's
[45:47] not God to them. To the atheists, he's
[45:50] definitely not God to them. So even
[45:53] though we say he is God,
[45:57] you can't just claim him to be God. If
[46:00] there's nobody to worship him or bow
[46:02] down to him, he is not God to them.
[46:05] Right? So you've got to understand what
[46:07] that means.
[46:09] What is it that makes him God?
[46:13] There has to be components that makes
[46:15] him God to somebody. And those
[46:19] components we know in a very broad sense
[46:24] as father, son, and the holy ghost. But
[46:26] what does that even mean? Those are
[46:28] different expressions over different
[46:30] dispensations of time. But we'll get to
[46:33] that some other time. So I'm coming back
[46:36] to this point that brother Brennham was
[46:38] anointed in diverse ways to show us what
[46:40] this new throne and Goded was such that
[46:43] his ministry seemed to rebel against all
[46:47] carnal understandings right and we're
[46:49] going to look at that Revelation
[46:52] 4 part 2 a message brother Mariam
[46:54] preached in 1961
[46:56] first of January now watch these
[46:59] statements that brother Brandham makes
[47:02] he says the first throne throne was in
[47:05] heaven. Judgment seat. Okay. Now, this
[47:09] is the first time we hear something like
[47:11] this. First throne was in heaven. We're
[47:13] going to get to this to what this really
[47:15] means. But notice here, the first throne
[47:17] was in heaven. Judgment seat. The second
[47:20] throne was Christ. The third throne is
[47:24] in man.
[47:26] Praise be to God. So, I wanted to I
[47:28] wanted to show you this so that you know
[47:31] I'm not making this up. Everything I've
[47:34] I've said to you is is from the message.
[47:39] Brother Baron says, "First throne was in
[47:41] heaven, judgment seat. Second throne was
[47:43] in Christ. Third throne is in man." So
[47:47] if you're looking for the throne of God
[47:49] today, it's supposed to be in the bride.
[47:53] It's supposed to be in man. How so? So,
[47:58] brother Reno says, "Now, let me take
[48:01] this little thing that I draw here. I
[48:03] wish I had a blackboard. Now, watch this
[48:05] carefully, saints. I'm reading. I could
[48:08] make it maybe more sensible for you.
[48:10] We're going to take, Brother Ben is
[48:12] saying, we're going to take and draw the
[48:13] quartz only. Make it in a round ring."
[48:17] So, Brother Benham makes this uh this
[48:20] these rings or like this. Either one. I
[48:24] believe like this maybe would be the
[48:26] best. We're going to take and make the
[48:28] courts. Now, what is man? He says he's a
[48:31] triune being. Body, soul, and spirit. Do
[48:33] you notice that? Body, soul, spirit.
[48:36] Three courts. Now, I want you to notice
[48:37] something. Before the seals, Brother
[48:40] Brandon preached body, soul, and spirit
[48:42] because that's how the denominations
[48:44] taught it. After the seals, he taught it
[48:46] as body, spirit, soul. He corrects
[48:48] himself. So,
[48:51] we're living in the time of the
[48:52] correction of that body, spirit, and
[48:55] soul. So I trust you to understand that.
[48:57] So he says, "How many knows that?" Watch
[48:59] God's approach. What is his heart? You
[49:01] remember my message? God chose a man, a
[49:04] man's heart for his control tower. The
[49:06] devil chose his head for his control
[49:08] tower. So he makes him see things. See,
[49:11] brother said he makes him see things,
[49:13] look through his eyes, but yet God in
[49:15] his heart makes him believe things that
[49:17] he cannot see. God is on his heart. In
[49:20] the heart of man is the throne of God.
[49:23] You get it right. God made his throne in
[49:26] the heart of man.
[49:29] So I want to skip ahead. Uh he said so
[49:32] the first part of man is his body. Right
[49:34] saints? So watch that. Just the same as
[49:36] Moses's outer court, the the outer court
[49:40] is man's body. The next part of course
[49:42] is his spirit which is the inner court
[49:45] and the the central is his heart or his
[49:49] soul. That's the center where the ark is
[49:52] and that's where God comes for the
[49:53] throne. That's what brother Bam is
[49:54] saying here. Verse paragraph 35 in a
[49:57] message how can I overcome? He says now
[50:00] as we study this my purpose of this is
[50:02] just not to come here to fellowship with
[50:04] you people which I love to do that. If I
[50:07] had chance to do that I would come to
[50:08] your home shake your hand talk with you
[50:11] sit down eat dinner with you sit down
[50:13] under the shade tree talk and fellowship
[50:15] a while. But when we come here we are
[50:17] here for one specific purpose. This is
[50:20] the house of correction. This is the
[50:22] throne. This is the throne of God.
[50:24] Judgment goes forth from the house of
[50:26] God. Here is where we come together in
[50:29] love. Uh gather in love with one another
[50:33] as only Christians can love. But in here
[50:36] we are under a leadership of the Holy
[50:38] Spirit. The Holy Ghost is among us and
[50:40] we're here to take reckoning among us to
[50:43] see where our short places are, our
[50:46] shortcoming. And how can we catch from
[50:49] from where we should be over to where we
[50:53] ought to be now, where we are, where we
[50:55] ought to be. And that's what we study.
[50:58] Ministers study those places for their
[51:00] people. When they see the people, the
[51:03] lack, then they begin on that.
[51:06] So God's final purpose saints what I
[51:10] want to show you now is to live his it's
[51:13] always been his purpose that is to live
[51:15] and rule from the heart of the believer.
[51:18] So
[51:20] um and this is just this is a believer
[51:22] who would surrender his body as a temple
[51:26] a throne to be used for God's divine
[51:29] purpose. That's been God's purpose for
[51:32] making man. There's never been a
[51:36] physical throne in in the universe
[51:38] somewhere where God sits and and
[51:40] presides over everything. The first
[51:43] throne he ever made was Adam.
[51:46] The first throne he ever made was man
[51:49] [clears throat] because that's where he
[51:50] wanted to dwell. That's where he wanted
[51:52] to to place his name. That's the place
[51:55] he chose that his name should dwell in.
[52:00] And that throne was destroyed. that
[52:02] throne was was marred in Eden. So from
[52:06] there he became separate from the throne
[52:09] that he created which was on earth
[52:12] and he had to bring the tabernacle in
[52:14] the wilderness of Moses to begin the way
[52:18] back to the throne. Right? The scripture
[52:21] that explodes this understanding on many
[52:24] different dimensions is this one.
[52:26] Matthew 18:20,
[52:29] "For where two or three are gathered
[52:32] together in my name, there am I in the
[52:36] midst of them." Right? Two or three
[52:38] gathered together in my name. Now, we
[52:40] know how the Pentecostals use this where
[52:42] two or three are gathered in his name.
[52:44] Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, in his name. What
[52:48] does that mean? Gathered in my name,
[52:51] there am I in the midst of them. Right?
[52:53] So we know that we are to be his throne.
[52:56] So why doesn't he just take us and use
[52:59] us, right?
[53:01] So watch this. Where two or three are
[53:04] gathered in my name, that means where
[53:08] two or three are united in the same
[53:11] revelation,
[53:13] [clears throat]
[53:13] there am I in the midst of them means
[53:17] there I can sanction what they sanction.
[53:24] Why is this statement being made?
[53:28] So we know that Matthew 18 this the
[53:32] context of the scripture is talking
[53:34] about the loosing of a brother or
[53:36] excommunication of a person. And the
[53:38] scriptures prior to this tell us that
[53:41] whatsoever you bind in earth. Whatever
[53:43] you loose in earth shall be bound in
[53:45] heaven shall be loosed in heaven.
[53:47] Binding and loosing are legal terms.
[53:49] When you say binding and loosing, you're
[53:51] talking about making a law or a
[53:54] judgment.
[53:56] And and what this means is you can't
[53:58] just have people who say, well, look,
[54:02] I'm an elder of this tribe. Speaking in
[54:04] the times of Israel, I'm an elder of
[54:06] this tribe and therefore I have
[54:08] authority and I speak for God. No such
[54:11] thing. You can't speak for God. The only
[54:14] way is that two or three gathered
[54:16] together in my name means they have the
[54:20] same revelation of who I am or they form
[54:24] part of something that I have sanctified
[54:26] to myself. There I am in the midst of
[54:29] them. That means if they decide on
[54:32] something it's as good as me deciding on
[54:35] something. See, that's why Matthew 18 is
[54:38] talking about it's talking about
[54:41] having two or three uh parts of me that
[54:46] can agree on the same thing. And you'll
[54:48] find in Matthew 18, it speaks about if
[54:51] you see a brother doing something wrong,
[54:53] you go and take this uh to the church,
[54:57] then let the church go and speak to or
[55:00] take two or three witnesses and go and
[55:02] speak to this brother. And if he still
[55:04] doesn't um make his life right, then you
[55:07] take it to the church. And now the
[55:10] church must speak to him, edify him, try
[55:14] to bring him back. So what you've done
[55:16] is you've tried three different things
[55:20] in the revelation of God.
[55:23] Once those things have done their work,
[55:27] God has sanctioned what has been done.
[55:31] Right? That's that's the context of the
[55:34] scripture where two or three are
[55:36] gathered in my name. This is a a
[55:39] scripture used so loosely about two or
[55:43] three people gathering under the banner
[55:46] of serving Jesus Christ. That's
[55:48] absolutely wrong. How many people in
[55:50] this world have churches of thousands
[55:54] saying they are gathered in Jesus' name?
[55:57] He we know for a fact that he's not in
[55:59] the midst of them.
[56:01] Why? Because they don't form his
[56:03] godhead.
[56:05] They are people gathered under the
[56:07] banner of Christianity, but he's not in
[56:10] the midst of them. They can't decide a
[56:11] thing for the kingdom of God. He doesn't
[56:14] sanction what they do,
[56:17] right? So, this has got to do with the
[56:20] throne of God. So, we know that we are
[56:23] to be his throne. So, why doesn't he
[56:25] just take us and use us, right? like we
[56:29] would connally think it should be. As
[56:32] every throne took many years to be
[56:34] built, so also does the believer take
[56:37] years to become sanctified and made
[56:39] ready. Right? For example, Solomon's
[56:42] temple, uh the tabernacle in the
[56:45] wilderness,
[56:46] uh the Lord Jesus Christ 30 years before
[56:50] his name, the name of God was seen.
[56:53] What do we do to make ready? To know how
[56:57] to be a proper throne, we must study his
[57:00] other thrones, the heavenly, the
[57:02] earthly, to see if we can be of the same
[57:06] fashion.
[57:08] Right? Let's read Acts chapter 7 as we
[57:12] close this introduction down. Acts 7:44
[57:16] to 45. our fathers. This is Stephen the
[57:19] um the disciples speak the disciple of
[57:22] Christ. Steven speaking uh here before
[57:26] he is stoned to death. Our fathers had
[57:29] the tabernacle of witness in the
[57:31] wilderness, as he had appointed,
[57:33] speaking unto Moses, that he should make
[57:36] it according to the fashion that he had
[57:38] seen, which also our fathers that came
[57:40] after brought in with Jesus into the
[57:43] possession of the Gentiles, whom God
[57:46] drove out before the face of our fathers
[57:48] unto the days of David, who found favor
[57:50] before God. That is, David found favor
[57:53] before God and desired to find a
[57:55] tabernacle for the God of Jacob. But
[57:58] Solomon built him an house. How be it?
[58:02] Steven is saying the most high dwelleth
[58:04] not in temples made with hands. So
[58:07] Steven is telling us that the the the
[58:10] the tabernacle in the wilderness that
[58:12] Moses built was a temporary throne. Uh
[58:15] [clears throat] and then the the temple
[58:17] that Solomon built was a temporary
[58:19] throne. And he says clearly the most
[58:21] high does not dwell in places like that
[58:25] as said the prophet. Verse 49, he's
[58:28] saying, "Heaven is my throne. Earth is
[58:30] my foottool. What house will you build
[58:32] me?" He's actually using heaven and
[58:34] earth to say, it's like spiritually,
[58:38] heaven is my throne, earth is my
[58:39] foottool. It's it's like that's how
[58:42] great I am. What house will you build
[58:45] me? In other words, what earthly
[58:47] building or natural building or
[58:49] tabernacle do you think is worthy of me
[58:52] or great enough for me? Say the Lord. or
[58:56] what is the place of my rest? Hath not
[58:59] mine hand made all these things? Said so
[59:02] all the things that you can make are the
[59:04] things made by me in the first place?
[59:08] Verse 51, you stiff necked and
[59:10] uncircumcised in heart and ears. You, in
[59:13] other words, you are unable to
[59:15] understand. You're trying to create
[59:17] natural things for me, but you you
[59:19] cannot understand. He says, you do
[59:21] always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[59:24] fathers did. So do ye. So saints, we
[59:28] will use this scripture to the end to
[59:32] see how our house should be built. Amen.
[59:35] So what we're going to do is we're going
[59:37] to we're going to study the tabernacle
[59:40] of Moses in the wilderness. We're going
[59:42] to study the throne in heaven, the
[59:47] visions of the throne in heaven that uh
[59:50] Isaiah saw, that John saw. We're going
[59:53] to study all the articles
[59:57] or the the the furniture that was within
[1:00:00] these these temples and tabernacles that
[1:00:03] were built. And we're going to line that
[1:00:06] up with our own bodies, our spirits, our
[1:00:10] souls, and see how it is, what we can do
[1:00:14] to become to make our bodies the perfect
[1:00:17] tabernacle
[1:00:18] fashioned and built after the specifics
[1:00:22] that God desires.
[1:00:24] And then we're going to have a look at
[1:00:26] what Godhead needs to dwell in that body
[1:00:30] to make that body a fully functioning
[1:00:34] throne of God. In the meantime, let's
[1:00:37] not be like these people Steven was
[1:00:38] speaking to. Let us not be stiff necked,
[1:00:41] that is proud. Let's not be
[1:00:44] uncircumcised, that means lawless in
[1:00:47] heart, to resist the Holy Ghost. For he
[1:00:50] will help us to be built a spiritual
[1:00:52] house, a a holy priesthood,
[1:00:55] incorruptible and eternal. Amen. That
[1:00:59] was God's purpose. That's what he
[1:01:01] prophesied of. That's why he made us.
[1:01:04] That's why he called us. That's why he
[1:01:06] sanctified us. That's why he justified
[1:01:07] us. That's the reason he filled us with
[1:01:09] the Holy Ghost. All things working
[1:01:12] together for this particular purpose. He
[1:01:15] wants us to be the throne of God. So in
[1:01:17] this simple introduction, I trust that
[1:01:19] you get the understanding of where we
[1:01:23] are going to with this. And I trust that
[1:01:26] the Lord will really bless this series
[1:01:28] to us. So may the Lord be with you and
[1:01:31] bless you until the next time.
