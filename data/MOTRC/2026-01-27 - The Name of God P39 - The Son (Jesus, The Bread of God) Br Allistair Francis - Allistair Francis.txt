Description:
This powerful sermon, titled "The Name of God: Jesus, The Bread of God," explores the spiritual significance of bread as a name and relationship between God and man. Delivered in 2026 as part of the "Knowing God" series, it tracks the evolution of "bread" from a natural curse in Genesis to the eternal, revealed Word in our day.

The Biblical Definition of Bread
In biblical terminology, bread is more than a loaf from a bakery. It represents sustenance and satisfaction.
- Prepared Food: Unlike fruit plucked from a tree, bread is food that has been gathered and prepared.
- The First Mention: In Genesis 3:19, God told Adam he would eat bread by the "sweat of his face." This meant both natural and spiritual sustenance would henceforth require labor and overcoming the "curse" of unbelief.
- Man's Hunger for Words: The message highlights that humans are instinctively "word-eaters." We seek out conversations, media, and teachings because our souls require words to survive just as our bodies require food.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The Lord bless you. While we're standing, let's read the word of God. And we're going to read from John chapter 6 verse 33. You just have you can just follow on your screen. And uh simple verse from the Bible, John 6:33. For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. The bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. The Lord add a blessing to his word. You may be seated. Amen. So this morning we're dealing with knowing God 2026. This is our series. We started I think it would have been 20 24 and or 23 and we're on the name of God uh part 39 and this is the son. We've been through the disposition of the father. We come to the son and this is part 12 and for a title it's going to be Jesus the bread of god. Amen. So, uh, Sunday school, I want you to pay careful attention because, um, we're going to talk about all the different kinds of bread in the Bible. And, uh, so I want you to get to know which kinds of bread there are in the Bible, right? And, uh, we're going to talk about how it happens in the Lord Jesus Christ and also in our day. So, pay careful attention. All right? So, we're going to look at this name of God, the bread of God. Okay? Jesus, the bread of God, the bread of God that came down from heaven. So, why is bread a name, right? We've seen other name. the rock of offense, the strong tower in uh in the Hebrew uh Bible, the rock of offense has a Hebrew word. It's a name. The same as Yeshua, the same as Jehovah. Rock is a name. Tower is a name. Strong tower. Uh Olam, everlasting God. Ellejon, Elroy, all those are are names of God that reveal a relationship to man in a specific time. Amen. So the bread of God is a name that relates to the son and never anywhere else. You wouldn't find this name relating to the father because the bread of God which came down from heaven relates to the son. It's a relationship that occurs with man particularly after the coming of Christ and that's why it's part of um the son. Now to you and I, we read the Bible, you've read the scripture, John 6:33, for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven. Honestly, how many of you actually read that scripture and think, "Thank God for the bread of God. you know, I I eat that every day. I have such a great relationship with the bread of God. You you you and I don't think of it in that in that because Christ never preached that particular message to you personally and uh even though it's there and you are experiencing the name, what we are doing is you you want to worship God but you cannot worship him whom you don't know. That's why our series is called knowing God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The only way you can know God is unless he has revealed himself to you. &gt;&gt; And how has he revealed himself to you in every name in every age? &gt;&gt; In every relationship he has with man. And we need to see what relationship he has with us in this time. Which is why the bread of God is actually a very intimate, very close and personal relationship with you today. And you don't even realize that. We don't even realize that. So bread, the bread of God is a relationship between God and men. So let's start from the very beginning and track the relationship of bread and mankind. Genesis 3:19. &gt;&gt; In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground. For out of it was thou taken. For dust thou art unto dust shalt thou return. Right? &gt;&gt; So right in the beginning it's the first time in the Bible you are seeing the word bread. All right? If I to ask anybody here what is bread? All of you would say it's that, you know, fluffy loaf that we slice and we make sandwiches with. How of you think Adam was making fluffy loaves? Was there even bread then? Adam, I don't think he was even making fire or or had an oven to make bread. So why would God say in Genesis 3 in the first time of creation telling Adam in the sweat of th of thy face shalt thou eat bread? Right? So bread in the Bible is a part of every meal spoken of. This is this is incredible. Forever after this whenever bread is spoken it's almost as if the people in the Bible ate nothing else but bread. Right. So bread publicly does not always refer to the bread that you and I eat today. &gt;&gt; It it doesn't in the Bible. It doesn't always refer to that when it in fact what we eat today the Bible identifies as cakes. &gt;&gt; Literally the word cakes and Abraham made cakes. Right? But bread is not cakes. Right? In the Bible, bread means anything that is obtained for sustenance, for food, like a staple, something you're going to eat every day. That is your bread. &gt;&gt; Is that right? When This is why when you pray the Lord's prayer, give us this day our daily bread. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's referring to a biblical terminology that has got nothing to do with bakers, &gt;&gt; brown bread or white bread or Albany, whatever you have in your area, that's not even bread. That's cakes, right? But we've gotten so used to it today that you know if your mom tells you, hey, go and buy bread from the store, you know what to get. You're not going to come back with vanilla cake, you know, or something else or or say, uh, you know, mom, for the whole week, we're going to eat steaks. That's going to be our bread. Jordan would love that. But when God spoke to Adam in Genesis 3:19, he was telling him that his sustenance, his food, his staple, what he's going to take to satisfy hunger. So what is bread? Bread is something that satisfies hunger. Amen. And it's not just that. Bread refers to prepared food. Right? So Adam's generation had to suffer with the curse to produce enough food and food that was good for their satisfaction. All right? So I want you to bear this in mind. Bread means anything that is obtained, anything that is extracted, anything that is used and prepared to be food. So you could Adam could take like uh I mean he wasn't going to he wasn't going to live on peaches and bananas and grapes and apples and for the rest of his life he's going to take things, put them together. He's going to mix up stuff and he's going to prepare something for him for them to eat. And anything that satisfies one's hunger. So before the fall, there was no curse. Adam could literally walk to a tree would produce fruit. He would eat the fruit. Wherever we would go, pluck corn from a from a corn plant and eat the corn. There was no no curse. There was no suffering. There was no, oh, we could wait for next season and we could have plant this. No, the earth was just growing and producing and they could eat. But now after the fall and after the curse, God told him, you are going to sweat. In other words, you are going to labor. You're going to work. In other words, food is not going to come easily anymore. Daily bread is not going to come easily anymore. So before the fall and before the curse, what did Adam feed on? What did Adam eat of? &gt;&gt; Right? You say, "Well, he just ate of the fruit of the trees because that's the evidence we have in the scripture." Is that right? So we have this amazing scripture in Deuteronomy 8:3 that everyone quotes, including Christ. And he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with mana which thou kneest not. Neither do thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live. By bread alone, or only, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of the Lord doth man live. So this was a special kind of bread that Adam lived on before the fall. Because you don't live by bread alone, but by every word. So we know this. Why? Because Adam ate of all the trees, including the tree of life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He was not supposed to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The tree of life was not a special tree that produced a special glowing light fruit that gave you supernatural power to live forever. Tree of life is the word of God &gt;&gt; for your day. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in other words, Adam ate of natural food and the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Is that right? So God was mysteriously telling man that he would only obtain God's word and his daily bread by sweating for it. So after the curse, natural food was going to be hard to come by and spiritual food because now that man has been excommunicated from God, he's been he's been let go. He is going to work hard to even get word from God. Is that right? What is hard work? Well, literally works. You're going to have to do the right thing. You're going to follow the rules. You're going to keep you're going to be moral. You're going to have to live righteously. And if you do the right thing, you be like Noah. You found grace in the eyes of God. And then God comes to you with the word, right? But it's going to take work by the sweat of your brow. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; So both natural food and spiritual food was going to be hard work to obtain. Why? Because of unbelief. But the grace of God overpowers his own correction, his own chastisement on his children. God gives us curse, but his grace still uh brings us the word in every day just so that we don't starve. Amen. How do we know this? We literally have a scripture for that. Um well, I think I didn't put it in, but it's Psalms 37:25. David says, "I've been young and old and I have not seen the righteous begging for bread." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love that because the righteous saints of God will not beg for revelation. &gt;&gt; Bread is is our revelation. Our revelation is our spiritual bread. That the word that God gives from his own mouth is our spiritual bread. Is that right? It's what our soul lives on. It's the only thing our souls can eat of. You see, you don't realize why things are the way they are in this world. When you were getting ready for church this morning, did a did a thought in your mind while you were taking a shower, putting on your clothes, or rushing to get to the car, rushing to get here early or something, did a thought ever cross your mind where you said, "What in the world am I doing? Why am I going to this church? What am I going to do there for the next two hours? Just sit there and look at this guy talking to me? Did it ever cross your mind thinking? What are all those people coming there together to do? Like don't we have something better to do? Why do other people in the city are they all going to different religious churches to go and sit down and listen to something? And those who are not, what are they doing? They are looking at the television or the internet or their phones. Do you realize more than half of your day whether you are Christian, message believer or atheist, you are feeding on words &gt;&gt; much more than even food. &gt;&gt; Well, some people do food more but no judgment, you know. But the majority of people in this world do not realize there's something undeniable inside them that wants to feed on words. They cannot get away from it. So even if you don't find a church or a temple or a mosque or something, you are going to gravitate to something. You just can't. You know that feeling of being alone? I feel alone. I got to be with friends. What is it that you really want? Nobody goes and meets with friends and and be like. If you try that, you'll be like, I need a new friend. This guy doesn't even talk, you know. He doesn't talk. You know, I go there, things are so awkward. I say something, there's no conversation flowing. I think we need new friends. You don't need new friends. What you really want is words. People, we need to wake up. You need to know why you come here because something inside you recognizes I need words. That's the only reason you come here. I mean, the music isn't all that great. This You're welcome, brother Steven. the the singing isn't all that fantastic. You know, the pastor isn't the friendliest guy in the world, but there's the reason why you come here and the reason why your soul is attracted here is because of the words. &gt;&gt; That's the only reason. And everybody else in this city is doing what they want to do because of words that are satisfying their souls somehow. It's undeniable. Even an atheist loves words. So it's unmistakable that men eat natural food and spiritual food. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But there's only one bread that gives ETERNAL LIFE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ALL OTHER words that are not from God do not bring eternal life. &gt;&gt; That's why you are here. &gt;&gt; That's why you wake up early on Sunday morning and have that shower and dress up and put on your best clothes and eat your breakfast and rush and get ready to be here at this pointless unattractive place &gt;&gt; because of words. That's it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. because you don't even it's like instinct. Your soul needs words to survive. So God actually put all of mankind that's not in my notes by the way. I just realized that a lot of people don't realize why they do what they do every single day. Why they go to work, why they go to a certain school, why they go to a certain university, why they go to a certain why they choose a certain vocation. There's something inside of them and only words can satisfy that. &gt;&gt; Nothing else. Even the job that you do, it's because of words that makes the job worth the while. &gt;&gt; You just scrutinize it a little bit more and you'll understand everything I'm telling you is the truth. &gt;&gt; You try and do a job where nobody talks to you and tell me how you feel after a couple of days. You know, I felt it. I studied engineering. Then I got onto this this um beautiful power plant. The engineering was fantastic. And then I realized I'm working with cold hard metal and and you know with these uh valves and these things and none of these things talk back to me. And the only people that talk back to me is the guy in the walkie-talkie who's swearing all the time. And I'm thinking this isn't the life of me. This is just not going to work. I could feel it. I can't do this. I need to be in touch with souls and souls who are want to fellowship on God's word &gt;&gt; and even some souls who are going to listen to me. I want people to listen to me. So that job was definitely not going to work. So God put mankind through a lesson of bread for the ages. So if you go through the Old Testament, you're going to see an entire lesson of bread taking place. It's phenomenal, right? What I found astounding was that God in his mercy took his children through a lesson of bread through all generations. And why does he do that? As always, the answers are all in the types and the shadows. Everything in the Old Testament was a shadow to show the presence of something real that's going to come. So he he took them through this lesson of natural bread because there's going to be spiritual bread coming and there's going to be training with the natural bread. But when the spiritual bread comes, that training is going to apply. Amen. And then it happened. And that and when that bread actually came in our day, that wasn't all because there was more bread to come. The bread that came 2,000 years, it wasn't finished. there was more bread to come. Amen. So the first time we see bread uh baked bread I think is u in Genesis 14:18. This is where the Bible says Melkchisedc brings bread and wine to Abraham. That's the first time. We see one scripture where he says to Adam, you will eat bread by the sweat of your brow. But the first time you actually see somebody bringing bread is actually MelkiseDC. Who is MelkiseDC? He is God. King and priest of Salem. &gt;&gt; He who is without descent, without father, without mother, &gt;&gt; without genealogy. That's from Hebrews chapter 7. He is the prefigure of Christ that is to come. He brings bread to Abraham. Right? What kind of bread was that? And everyone thinks, well, it was like communion, you know, because we hear the prophet saying he served communion to Abraham. The second time we hear of bread is now Abram's turn. When he's seeing MelkiseDC, who is Elohim, coming to him, what does Abraham do? He goes and makes cakes &gt;&gt; in the plains of memory, Genesis 18:6, and kills the feted calf and brings milk with butter and everything. But there is bread again. baked bread. Now, I don't think it's a coincidence because uh then we find, you know, obviously Abraham learned this from MelkiseDC. Now, he's serving bread back to MelkiseDC. And then Lot must have heard this whole story. When the two angels came to Sodom to save Lot in Genesis 19:3, it says Lot makes unleavened bread to serve the angels. Now, I don't know about you, if you tasted unleavened bread, it's not very tasty. It's like flat and tasteless. So, why was Lot thinking he needs to make unleaven bread for the angels? There must have been some understanding they had about bread. Believe me, if I make unleaven bread for you and invite you to dinner, you're never going to come back again. It's really not that tasty. It's like flour and water mixed and and maybe a little bit of salt, I don't know, but nothing. It's not fluffy. It doesn't come out into a beautiful loaf. There's no sugar in it. You'll be like, "Man, these people are cheap like give us food like this." And Indians, oh my word, they can't even make their rotty nice, you know, because it kind of looks like rotty. But it's terrible. It's a Middle Eastern thing, right? that they that they used to dip in like balsamic vinegar and uh olive oil or something and they used to eat that with some kind of meat or vegetables or something that they had dates and things like uh um that's Middle Eastern food. But if you and I eat unleaven bread, trust me, you're not going to have more of it. No way. But Lot makes unleaven bread for the angels. I mean, was that the best he could do? Why would you make unleavened bread for the angels? Obviously, there's a kind of respect here like unleavened bread is meant for holy people, &gt;&gt; right? Abraham by revelation must have made the same bread though he was not even instructed by God to make this bread. So, we know that leavened bread is more attractive, bigger, fluffier, softer, tastier, right? Some of you are getting hungry. So, why make unleavened bread? Let's read Exodus 12:8. So, here's our first part of our our lesson of bread through the ages. Are you ready? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. Sunday school, you're listening. Exodus 12 and:e 8. And they shall eat the flesh in the night, that is the roast lamb, with fire and unleavened bread, with bitter herbs, they shall eat it. So the first bread we come across now that is identified is unleavened bread. And God makes it a law that the Israelites keep the Passover with unleavened bread. Why? What's wrong with 11? All right. So, we we then read in Leviticus 23:5-6 in the 14th day of the first month at even is the Lord's Passover. All right. So, 14th day and on the 15th day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord. Seven days you must eat unleavened bread. So there's the first lesson on bread that God's children are learning. For the rest of the year, you can eat um leavened bread. You can put yeast. Yeast is the leaven. You can put yeast. It's a kind of bacteria that you put into bread to make it all fluffy and it when it gets in the oven and under the heat it just it it fluffs out and becomes this big loaf of bread. But for 7 days at the feast of Passover, you shall eat unleavened bread for 7 days. Right? So the feast of unleven bread started on the 15th which meant it would end on the 21st of the month. So far the type of bread we have seen that is a relationship to believers is unleaven bread. Right? So believers must have a relationship with unleaven bread. He's actually taking them through this in natural life that you need to have this relationship, right? God's not just doing this for, oh, it's so healthy to have this, you know, and once in a while you must fast and this fast must be with unleaven bread. There's a lesson that's going to happen here, right? Now, there's a distinction. This unleavened bread must be eaten with the Passover lamb, right? You're not going to have the Passover lamb where the blood was shed for salvation for your sin. You're not going to have this with leavened bread. You cannot have the lamb with leavened bread. &gt;&gt; You can eat anything else the rest of the year with the year with leavened bread. But when you eat the lamb, it requires unleavened bread. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. There's a distinction. It's as if leavened bread is not an expression of God's relationship to men. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Got it? &gt;&gt; God's relationship to men is is very different. So all other parts of your life, you have a relationship of leaven with everything else. But when it comes to the lamb of salvation, the relationship has got to do with unleavened bread. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So there's your first type of bread. Let's go to the next type of bread. Mana. Mana. Bread from heaven. Okay. Why does What does mana mean in sha? Anybody? Nothing. Why do I remember something close by? Never mind. I remember something but it's it's been a a long time. So this then appeared this other type of bread fell from heaven. But this bread, this manner, this new type of bread. Now it had laws. This bread came with law. Okay? If you didn't eat this bread with the law, this bread was not going to work well for you. Okay? Let's read it. Exodus 16 and verse 3-5. And the children of Israel said unto them, to God we had died. children of Israel complaining, right? You're not giving us good food. Would a God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the in the land of Egypt when we sat by the flesh pots when we did eat bread to the full for you have brought us forth into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger. Then said the Lord unto Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you." Now, it's the first time they're going to see bread falling from the atmosphere, or they're not even going to see it, but they're going to know it fell from the heavens somehow, right? I will rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go and gather a certain rate. There's the law. You can't gather everything. You can't gather over the limit. There's a law attached to mana. and that I may I'm giving you this law attached to this manner to prove you to see if you can keep the law right whether they walk in my law or not. So this bread came with conditions. &gt;&gt; That means there's a law that there there's bread that God can give you that's only going to function well if it's met with conditions. It's a very good teaching on word. And it shall come to pass on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. In other words, um for the first five days, let's say Monday to Friday. Yeah. Or uh Sunday to Friday, right? You're going to you're going to no Monday to Friday. You're going to take one each. going to take a certain amount. That's the law. This bread is not going to work for you if you take more than that. That's as much as each person must take. But on the sixth day, you're going to take double the amount because on the seventh day, this this manner is not going to fall. So this manner is only going to fall for six days. But on the sixth day, you will take double the amount. So it'll last you over to the seventh day. Let's read in in Exodus um 16:14 to 15. And when the dew that was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness, there lay a small round thing as small as the frost on the ground. So this this this man fell like little snowflakes. And the Bible kind of teaches it tasted like wafer that's mixed with honey. And it fell a small little white flex. It looked like coriander seed, right? Or coriander flour like that. And it fell all over the place. So you would go up and collect this thing. Nobody knew what it was, right? And uh verse 15. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said uh one to another, "It is mine now." For they whisped not what it was. And Moses said unto them, "This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat." Okay. So the word mana in the Hebrew or mana it is a question. It means what is it? So the children of Israel went out there and look picked it up. They were not calling it by a new name. They were saying what is it? Mana. So that's how the name stuck. See so from then on this new bread was called what is it? You know, I can imagine some mother telling a son, "Go out and get some. What is it?" has also a different meaning. Who is it? What is it? Or who is it? With the same uh word. So, the Bible tells us they didn't know what it was. In other words, this bread is a mystery to them. It's mysterious. They can't explain it, but it works for them as long as they keep the law. Are you seeing a lesson of bread? &gt;&gt; Okay. There's literally a lot of the word of God that is given to you. It's only going to work for you if you keep a law, a condition. Okay. So, what's it symbolized? that bread from heaven WITH A MYSTERIOUS element came with a question and conditions attached. Moses told them what it was. He said, "This is the bread of God from heaven for you." He identified it. This is the bread which the Lord had given you to eat. Amen. So, this being the bread of heaven was then a shadow pointing to something that's going to come spiritually someday. There's going to be a bread that comes from heaven in the future, right? But for Israel, this bread lasted one day only. So, for the for the first five days, like I explained, uh you only gather one omr. Omar is a a um a measurement, I suppose. They had these all the same uh containers with exactly the same measurement. Now, here's the thing about this bread from heaven, this bread from the Lord. If you took more than one, if on Monday you went out AND YOU, OH, THIS STUFF, I LOVE THIS STUFF. TASTES LIKE WAFERS WITH HONEY. GATHER IT ALL UP. Don't tell anyone. Don't tell Moses. Let's take a second container. This bread has an intelligence in it that as soon as it hits Tuesday morning, it's filled with worms. &gt;&gt; They said it stank like maggots. You know what maggots? &gt;&gt; Maggots are worms that attach themselves to rotting material. &gt;&gt; They eat contaminated. How can God give you a bread that in the next day becomes contaminated? If you don't take it with the law, it becomes a stink. &gt;&gt; So this mana that fell from day one to day five could not last for more than one day. But amazingly on the sixth day, this mana decided I can last for one more day. &gt;&gt; It would literally rot overnight and be disgusting the next day. This word, this manner, this food from heaven, this food from the Lord would rot the next day and be disgusting that you couldn't even put it in your mouth. Oh, incredible. What kind of bread has a mind of its own &gt;&gt; to follow a schedule? A schedule like that. And what was the purpose? Literally, so I can prove you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to give you food that's going to test you. It's going to prove you whether you can keep my law or not. &gt;&gt; Incredible. The bread of the Lord became a stink the next day if you took more than you should have taken. And then Moses was told to gather up one day supply. This is amazing. Moses was this manner is we're not done with this manner. This what is it? Moses on the first time that this mana fell, God told him, "Now you go take an OMR. You gather up an R of that and then you take it behind the veil into the holiest of holies." And there the same manner would stay forever. And in the presence of God, that same manner was without any law, without any conditions. It did not fail. That one, even if Moses went in and took some out, it replenished and and you could eat it and eat and eat it and it would just replenish. It would not run dry. It would not rot. It had no law attached. It had no conditions. When that same word which was now brought into the earthly dimension behind the veil in the shakina glory, no conditions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Same manner. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Right now, I wish I had some evangelical gift. I'll be all over the place. And so Moses did as God commanded. And this bread became eternal bread behind the veil. Its supply never failed and it would not corrupt or stink. Now, when you study the aspects of this bread from heaven, it's really quite fascinating. Now, I could take it right now. I'm not going to do that, but I'll just tell you, as long as you this bread is in the flesh, it comes with laws. &gt;&gt; When this bread goes behind the veil, there's no laws. &gt;&gt; There's no conditions. That bread keeps replenishing itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the same word L the word of the Lord from heaven but on behind the veil there's no conditions when you take it in the Sabbath it will on the sixth day it will last you for two days but on all the other days if you take more than you can it'll kill you &gt;&gt; it's it's a stench it becomes denominational &gt;&gt; it becomes organized religion it just depends where you're taking it All right, you ready? There's another bread, showbread. So, there's another type of bread that we find after the tabernacle is built now. And uh um this type of bread emerges on their walk in the wilderness, right? God instructs them to make a bread that is only for the priesthood, the ministry because it is holy bread. What is holy, right? So you know you have all the children of Israel and you have the priesthood. The children of Israel were not holy. The priesthood was holy. What does that mean? But they all keeping the law. Keeping the law, doing good, being righteous is not holy. Holy means you are connected to the tabernacle. You are uh you your purpose is to the tabernacle. That's what holiness is. Holiness is you have a purpose to the service of God. That is a holy man, right? So a holy man is not somebody who uh walks around in white robes and doesn't touch any dirty thing and he doesn't live wrong and he's he doesn't say anything wrong. He never makes a mistake. No, a holy man can be a ruffian like John the Baptist who's filthy thinking doesn't speak right but he's connected to the purpose of God for his day. That is a holy man. &gt;&gt; So what is holy? You're connected to the temple. You have a job to do that is for God. You don't have another vocation on the side. A holy man is a man connected to the purpose of God. He lives his life in connection to that purpose. That is holy. Okay. Got it? So this is why this is holy bread. Only the priests could eat it. It is the Bible calls it hallowed bread. Hallowed bread is holy bread. It means that this bread now is not like mana which which feeds everybody. This bread only occurs within the veil, the first veil in the inner court. It's not even in the outer court. It's in the inner court where the candlesticks are. Are you with me? It's on the table of showbread. And this bread actually has leaven in it. Whoa. This is amazing, right? This bread uh is in the inner court. It has some leaven in it and it is for the priesthood. Okay, I love this. Let's read Leviticus 24 5-9. And thou shalt take fine flour and bake 12 cakes thereof. Two tent deals shall be in one cake. And thou shalt uh set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the Lord. And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And verse 8 and verse 9, every Sabbath he shall set it in order before the Lord continually being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant. And it shall be Aaron and Aaron's and his sons. So this showbread is for Aaron and his sons. In other words, the priesthood, the Levitical priesthood. And they shall eat it in the holy place. Not the holiest of holies. The holy place. The holy place is the first, the inner court. The holiest of holies is behind the veil. Are you with us? So they're not allowed to eat this bread in their home. They're not allowed to eat this bread in the outer court. They can only eat this bread in the inner court. And this bread has a little bit of leaven in it in the inner court. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So only a a holy man, a priest, one who served the word and the tabernacle could eat this bread. And it even has a weird name, showbread. What is showbre which literally is showbre as in exposed bread or revealed bread. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Now this bread also has law connected to it. It could it could only be eaten by priests. It could only be eaten in the inner court. And um it could not if you if you ate it anywhere else, you would die. God would kill you. You're not supposed to take this anywhere else. It's meant for the priesthood. It's meant for the inner court. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So along the way, as time goes by, the law of this bread is slightly adjusted. &gt;&gt; How? So we see in 1st Samuel chapter 21:3-6 and therefore so oh let me explain this before we read this okay David and his men have been running from Saul and now they're they've been running for many days they had no food and they're absolutely hungry. It's been 3 days they're literally starving. They're almost dying from starvation and they come up to the tabernacle to the priests and all the priests have is showbre. So David comes up and he asked, "Now therefore, what is under thine hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand or what there is present." And the priest answered David and said, "There is no common bread under mine hand." Means I don't have any other bread for you, but there is hallowed bread. And the priest says, "If, look at the condition, if the men have kept themselves at least from women." &gt;&gt; And David answers the priest and said unto him, "Of a truth woman have been kept from us about 3 days since I came out." And the vessels of the young men are holy. That means they are have been committed to the purpose of God. And the bread is in a manner common. Yay, though it was sanctified this day in the vessel. Verse six, so the priest gave him hallowed bread, they not priests now. &gt;&gt; David is of the tribe of Judah and his men of the same and are with him. They are not priests now. They're giving them priests bread. They're not priests and they're not in the inner court. &gt;&gt; Yeah. For there was, in other words, this bread is actually been taken out of the inner court. First law broken. And then given to someone else who is not of the tribe of Levi. Second law broken. It doesn't even mean it's breaking. It means the law is being adjusted &gt;&gt; for the tribe of Judah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What's happening with showbread? What we're seeing is now the law is being shifted. It now can be only eaten by a king and a priest. &gt;&gt; But for the regular men to eat. So David is the king, but his men are not. So the king and the priest can eat it. But there's also a condition allowed where you can also eat this if you have not been defiled with women for at least 3 days. Oh my. Can you see these lessons of bread &gt;&gt; throughout the scripture? Why is this significant? Because in the church ages, we have this criterion written in symbol form. You can read in revelations 20 uh 2 20-22. Um, notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that women Jezebel, which call itself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, spiritual fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols. And I gave her space to repent of her fornication. And she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds. So I'll cast her into a bed, right? A relationship and those that commit adultery with her. Okay. Chapter 14 verse 3 to 4. And this is the 144,000 standing on the mount with the lamb. And it says, "And they sung a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders. And uh no man could learn that song but 144,000 thousand which was redeemed from the earth." These are they which were not defiled with women, &gt;&gt; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the lamb whethersoever he goeth. &gt;&gt; These were redeemed from among men being the first fruits unto God and to the lamb. So what we have is in the book of revelations, it tells you those who were thrown into great tribulation or those thrown into damnation were those who were defiled with Jezebel. But there are these people who learned the song which is a song coming from heaven from the bride 144,000 and they are only learning that song because THEY ARE NOT DEFILED WITH WOMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; JUST AS THOSE WHO ARE SINGING THE song were not defiled with women. What does it mean? What does it mean? Defiled with women. The symbol in revelation being defiled with women means organized religion. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Or denominationalism. &gt;&gt; So watch how it works. Now those who were linked to the women Jezebel could not eat of the showbread, right? &gt;&gt; You could be the priesthood, but if you were defiled with women, this bread is not going to work for you. In other words, this bread which has some leaven in it which ripens under the light of the candlestick. Right? So what happens in the inner court is this bread which is meant for the priesthood which has a little bit of leaven. It li it ripens under the the light of the messengers. It becomes fluffier and becomes something that can be fed to the people. It's something that the ministry can receive and serve the people. Is that right? &gt;&gt; So this light of the messengers ripens this to the ministry. Why to the ministry? And why is the leaven in it? Because of where we are living. What is the ministry to do? Is to deal with people. IS TO TAKE THE word and make it applicable to human life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is leaven in there. And under the light of the candlestick, it can be it can grow. It can ripen. This is the work of the ministry. We are supposed to take the word of God and make it applicable to corrupt human life &gt;&gt; and and bring teaching from the inner court in the spirit realm and bring the word so that it can be used uh in your lives of Lev. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; AND THIS CAN ONLY APPLY IF THERE IS the priesthood, if there is Judah the king or if the people have kept themselves from organized religion. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. They're the only conditions with showbread. &gt;&gt; And what is showbre? Revealed bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why would you need revealed bread? Because you are living in this life of sin. You're living in leaven. You are living in this life of corruption. There is word that's been there that's been taught and there's leaven in there. But it will only ripen under the light of the messengers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So those who were linked to Jezebel in the church ages could not. But then after 3 days of Luther, Wesley and Pentecost breaking away from Jezebel, there comes a time where the believer who is no longer defiled with women. Come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be no longer partakers of her evil ways. &gt;&gt; Right? You come out of her after three days and you eat the revealed word meant for priests and kings. Amen. &gt;&gt; So through David, God makes the showbread for kings and priests. But David took and gave to his men and the qualified only. They qualified only because they were not defiled with women for at least 3 days. So the Bible indicates that that makes you holy because if you are separating yourself from organized religion, you are now joining yourself to the service of God. &gt;&gt; And that's what makes you holy. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So far, we've been through these uh breads in the Old Testament, right? And it just gets more and more exciting. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to breads of Elijah. Did you know there were breads of Elijah? Okay, let's go to First Kings 17:6. You know what was the first bread Elijah encountered? Raven's bread. And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening. And he drank of the brook. We don't know what this bread was, but we know ravens, they steal. &gt;&gt; So they were stealing bread from somewhere and bringing bread to Elijah. Now, we're not talking about this bread is talking about sustenance. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; they may not have been bringing him cakes or bread from the bakery. whatever food they could find that was edible, they were bringing him all kind. It could have been meat. This bread he was eating could have been meat, could have been dates, could have been um olive seeds or whatever um olive fruit or what we call olives. They could have been bringing him all sorts of stuff and that was the bread that the ravens were bringing, stolen bread. Ravens are scavengers and perhaps they were instructed BY GOD, GO AND steal bread for Elijah, &gt;&gt; right? So, they were bringing bread to Elijah from other people. We don't know. But Elijah could not live on Raven's bread. He had to leave, right? Because it was a time of famine and he prophesied the famine and the rains was going to come. So now he's suffering under his own prophecy &gt;&gt; and the ravens he's living on stolen food, right? And he has to leave raven's bread and he has to go look for this widow of Zarapath. Now he goes to the widow of Zarapath and we find the bread of Elijah and the widow, second bread of Elijah. So he arose and went to Zarapath or Sarapa. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was gathering of sticks. Uh uh and he called to her and said, "Fetch me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel that I may drink." And as she was going to fetch the water, he called to her and said, "Bring me, I pray, thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand." So he's asking this woman for bread. And she said, "As the Lord thy God liveth, I have not a cake, but a a handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruise, and behold, I'm gathering two sticks that I may go in and dress it for me and my son, that we may eat it and die." We have the last little bit of meal and oil, and we're going to bake this. We're going to eat our last bit of food. And what a horrible situation. I mean, you don't think long enough on that. Can you imagine this this child of God, this this prophet of God comes up there and there's this woman. She's literally telling you, "We have our last Buddha food. After we eat this, my son and I have resolved. We're going to die from starvation." Right? And Elijah said unto her, "Fear not. Go and do as thou has said, but make me thereof a little cake first. Bring it unto me, and after make for for thee and for thy son." She just told him, "We only have enough for my son and I to eat." Uh, he says, "Don't worry, this is a prophet. See, listen, Elijah, he's telling you, don't worry. Just go and make for me and then go make for for your son and for you." And she's, you know, like you and I today, all bright spots today must have been thinking something wrong with this guy. The feminine maybe tapped in the head a little bit. I just told you we have only enough. How do you expect me from what I have to make for you first? Then go like if after I make for you, where am I going to get the stuff for me and my son afterward? &gt;&gt; He's saying, "Don't worry. Thus sayeth the Lord, it's going to happen. You're just going to have to take my word for it. You're just going to have to believe." &gt;&gt; Of course, she was a believer. &gt;&gt; Kind of like what's happening today, right? For thus said the Lord God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the curse of oil, the cruise of oil fail until the day that the Lord sendeth rain upon the earth. So he just told her, "Don't worry, for thus says the Lord, after you do what I tell you, the oil and the meal will not fail until the prophecy is fulfilled." Mhm. &gt;&gt; Oh my, there's a lot in there. Verse 15. And she went and did according, this is the bride. She went and did according to the saying of the prophet. And she and he and her house did eat many days. &gt;&gt; Right? What is the condition with this bread? The prophet has to be present. The pro this this bread is only this this prophecy is only going to last until the day the prophecy ends. Right? Verse 16. And the barrel of meal wasted not. Neither did the cruise of oil fail according to the word of the Lord which he spake by Elijah. &gt;&gt; The Lord spake by Elijah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is the bread with another condition. The woman has to make the bread to sustain herself. But the ingredients of the bread, which is the meal and the oil. So are you I I think you just missed that. The prophet's word is only going to produce meal and oil. &gt;&gt; You have to make the bread. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You have to read the books. Unfortunately, &gt;&gt; he's not going to prepare it for you. So like for all these people who want brother Barams was to just prepare it for you &gt;&gt; and just make it all make sense. &gt;&gt; IT MUST ALL BE PERFECT AND UNDERSTANDABLE and it must not stumble me. It must not say any No, I'm sorry. You got to make the bread. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's just provided the ingredients and it's only going to last until the days of the prophecy are fulfilled &gt;&gt; because thereafter you're going to need something special. Amen. What is it? Obviously, the woman types the church and this is a time of famine where bread is scarce. What is bread? Prepared food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not just prepared food, but the ingredients for prepared food is scarce. These people think, "Oh, we must leave the prophet and go back to the Bible." You can't EVEN PREPARE FROM THE BIBLE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; You can't even look at what they're doing with the Bible. You take the Bible and you're producing all kinds of food that's it's not even going to last. It's and you take in more than you can. It's like mana which fell for you. There are conditions that go with it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. That is what written word is. The prophet comes in during this time of famine. Imagine we actually have the Bible in this world and there is a famine of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In churches, &gt;&gt; people are dying of hunger with the Bible. &gt;&gt; A prophet comes in during the time of famine. She makes her choice. She takes a risk taking him in and housing him. But as long as he's there, the ingredients of bread does not fail. I don't have to preach enough on that for you to realize what the prophet's presence means to you during the time of famine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, that doesn't stop there with Elijah because then it ends and after his time with the widow of Zarapath, he now has to move on and there's another bread that he lives by. This is bread from the angel. So not ravens anymore. Now he's being chased again because now after his time with this this true church, he's now running for his life from his accusers, from the system of Jezebel. He's running for his life. What's he going to do now? He's just a prophet. How's he going to feed himself? Right? He's just a prophet. First Kings 19:4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree and he he requested for himself that he might die. Even prophets have time of weakness. &gt;&gt; Lord, just let me die. Can't take it anymore. I'm running for my life. I I once dramatized this to you. I I explained to you what Elijah must have went through. They were pursuing him through the wilderness. He was hiding behind sand dunes, behind bushes, behind rocks, looking for caves, through heat, through the night. They were pursuing him. They were chasing him. He was escaping them, but he couldn't take it anymore. He had reached mental fatigue, bodily fatigue, no food to eat, no water to drink. He was at the end of his tether. People don't realize this when they read the story. Amen. Lord, take away my life for I am not better than my fathers. I can't make it. All those stories I heard that happened with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and all those great men. Clearly, I don't have the faith of my fathers. Lord, I'm done for. You ever have those days? &gt;&gt; Amen. And as he lay and slept under the juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him and said unto him, "Arise and eat." Amen. And he looked, and behold, there was a cake baked on the coals, and a cruise of water at his head, and he did eat and drink and laid him. So, what do you think? Apparently, there's a cake baked bread on the coals. So this angel put coals and fire and got ingredients and baked bread for him and he's eating. And you think, "Oh, that's great." You know, that's good. We understand that. Nothing supernatural about that. No, it gets worse or better. Where am I? Yeah. And the angel of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said, "Arise." So he ate the first time and he was still too weak. The bread the angel gave him the first time didn't even do enough. It sustained him. It kept him alive and he passed out again. When it says he went back to sleep, it means he was passed out unconscious. That's how weak he was. Now the second time the angel comes him and tells him arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee. What you're about to to experience next is too much. You need to eat. Got it? And he arose the second time did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat 40 days and 40 nights unto Horeb the mount of God. This is not just some cake that's made on the fire. &gt;&gt; What kind of I'd like to have some of that &gt;&gt; makes me go 40 days and 40 nights. &gt;&gt; He went in the strength of that meat that he ate when the angel touched him a second time. What we are about to see happening here is man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; There's something greater than the the bread in Sera. There's something greater than raven's food. There's something greater than mana from heaven. There's something greater than word that comes with conditions. There's a word that comes with an angel that descends FROM HEAVEN THAT MAKES YOU GO WITH A SUPERNATURAL FILLING &gt;&gt; THAT GOES FOR DAYS THAT SUSTAINS YOU THAT COMES WITHOUT LAWS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THIS IS THE JOURNEY FOR THE THIS IS THE FOOD FOR THE JOURNEY THAT IS TOO GREAT. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. What kind of bread was this? And we see this happening because we see this in Moses, right? Moses goes up into the mountain and he was there with the Lord 40 days and 40 nights. Did neither eat bread nor drink water &gt;&gt; and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant. It means here again Moses is eating something that Elijah had. What was he eating? The word. THE WORD OF GOD THAT COMES FROM THE MOUTH OF GOD THAT SUSTAINED YOU FOR 40 DAYS AND 40 NIGHTS. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; We know this happened when Christ himself who is the bread from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is the word himself went into the wilderness TO BE TESTED LIKE EVERY OTHER MAN. And the tempter comes to him and says to him, "You look hungry. You look like you could do something tasty. You have the power. Why not turn your stones into bread?" And his answer was Deuteronomy. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. It is written. Amen. You know, I recently heard someone say um uh against the prophet, right? These people I've been getting a lot of this. You can imagine the last two weeks I saw some ministers say it's the written word. We must take it back to the written word. JESUS ONLY SAID the written word. When the tempter came to him, he said, "It is written. It is written. It is written." How could they not see the last part? &gt;&gt; The last part was, "Get thee behind me, Satan." Which was not written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was It COMES TO AN END WHEN WHEN THE ENEMY HAS HAD ENOUGH AND AND THERE'S NO MORE YOU CAN SAY THAT IS WRITTEN. You got to have something inside that speaks from your HEART AND SAYS, "GET THEE BEHIND ME, SATAN." &gt;&gt; You got to have an ANSWER TO THE DEVIL'S QUESTION. AT SOME POINT, YOU STOP REASONING with what is written. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you got TO HAVE SPOKEN WORD WITHIN YOU. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That's where their argument falls apart. We come to this time where everything they're taking us back to the Bible. Back to the Bible. What is written? What is written? You have a sp a scripture that literally tells you the letter killth but the spirit gives life. &gt;&gt; You take everything BACK TO WHAT IS WRITTEN UP TO A POINT &gt;&gt; and then you've got to have word in you that says get thee behind me &gt;&gt; Satan. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Here when Jesus is tempted he invokes Deuteronomy 8:3. This lesson on natural bread that had taken place 4,000 years under the law was a prefigure of what was going to happen with spiritual bread with the emergence of the Lord Jesus Christ. So now we come to Jesus part three, the bread from heaven. &gt;&gt; Are you ready? &gt;&gt; All right. So John chapter 7, we're going to do Christ and bread. Now we're going to see the same lesson of bread in Christ. All that happened in the Old Testament now happens here with Christ. And we even see all the manifestation and the development of it. So John 7:41. Others said this is the Christ, but some said that uh shall Christ come out of Galilee? Hat the scriptures said that Christ um uh that the Christ cometh of the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was? All right. How many of you have your phones here? Yeah, take out Google. I'm giving you I'm giving you permission to Google something. What does Bethlehem mean? What does Google it and tell me something? First person tell me what does Bethlehem mean? Yes, brother. the house of bread. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, the house of bread, which is the which is where David came from. So this whole story of bread literally starts where he is born. &gt;&gt; Right? And he comes preaching and starts off with warning about a certain type of bread we started with, right? Matthew chapter 6 verse 5. So he's born in the house of bread. That's no coincidence. I mean, he could have been born anywhere, right? Bethl, he could have been born in Beth Shebar. Um, he could have been born anywhere. He could have been born in Jerusalem, but he was born in the house of breath. Um, Matthew 6 uh 16:5-12. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread. There's a story about bread. Now, SO HIS DISCIPLES, WHO ARE THESE DISCIPLES? So maybe you don't know. Let's be before we go to them. In the Jewish custom, if there is a rabbi among you, a rabbi is a teacher. He's your master. He's a he's the one who's teaching you the scripture and giving you the the word of God for YOUR DAY. YOU RESPECT your rabbi. So wherever your rabbi goes, you as his disciples are following him. You are making the travel arrangements. You are collecting the food for the journey. You, it's your job to prepare the lunch. He's supposed to go and answer questions and teach the word. You're supposed to take care of everything. Now they're in trouble because they forgot to take bread. Right now, here's the problem. Jesus said unto them, "Take heed and beware of the leavenven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees." Now he knows they had forgotten to take bread for the journey and he senses in them this worry. What is the master going to say? We've been irresponsible. We didn't even think to take bread. We're in trouble with him. And he discerning them says, "Beware of the leaven." He stays on the topic of bread, right? And they reasoned among themselves, saying, "It is because we took no bread." When Jesus perceived, he said unto them, "Oh, you have little faith. Why you did I miss something?" Oh, yeah. They reasoned among themselves, saying, "It is because we have taken no bread." So, they're thinking, he's talking about the leaven of the Pharisees because they took no bread. So he says to them, when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, "Oh ye of little faith, why reason you among yourselves because you have brought no bread? Do you not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves or the 5,000 and how many baskets you TOOK UP?" SO HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED. The disciples were walking with Christ EVERY DAY. THEY WERE JUST GOING ACROSS the sea JUST AFTER HAVING FED 5,000 with a great miracle where it was said, "Surely this is the Christ, the Messiah." Because of this miracle that was done, right? They just seen that. Now they go across the sea with him and they're worried about breadh. All you'd have to do is sit with me and say, "Master, give us more of that bread, please." Right? No. Do you not yet understand? Neither remember the five loaves of the 5,000. Verse 10. Neither the seven loaves of the 4,000 and how many baskets you took up. Right? How is it that you do not understand that I spake it not to you concerning bread? &gt;&gt; So, I wasn't talking about natural bread. I'm talking about the spiritual bread of the Pharisees that you should beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the Sadducees. Then understood they how that he b them not beware of the leaven of natural bread but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees. Right? So he told them the leaven of the Pharisees which was that which was uh which the leavenven of the Pharisees created a nature in them. to make them doubt, &gt;&gt; okay? And and feel like they needed to have taken extra care in case they got hungry and starved. Like you were with the creator &gt;&gt; who just fed 5,000 one and 4,000 another. You're with him. If there was a mistake, come on. &gt;&gt; He'll make food out of anywhere. &gt;&gt; HE'LL BRING FISH. He'll bring anything. We're with the creator himself. What put this leaven in you? Be aware of that. So they should have just known and said, "Lord, give us bread." That was the leaven of the Pharisees. So what was the leavenven of the Pharisees? This intellectual uh conception of the word. This intellectual manipulation of the law of God by the Pharisees. In other words, they were taking the law of God and putting their own manipulation into it. &gt;&gt; So the the leaven of the Pharisees was the interpretation of the word that they were putting into it that was bringing fear and doubt in the people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that leaven or that bread that the Pharisees gives you brings a believer absolutely no personal strength to act by faith. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; Psalm 20:17 says, "The bread of deceit is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth is filled with gravel." So bread of deceit, that's what the Pharisees give you. This uh doctrinal manipulation, it's sweet. It's wonderful. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Glory. jumping up, shouting and but afterward your mouth is filled with stones, &gt;&gt; gravel. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; All right. So now I want to get to the main scripture before we close this down. Uh so in Matthew 15:23-26, you remember uh we we're going to be speaking about Jesus, the bread of God, the bread from heaven. Okay, you remember we spoke about this recently, the Syrphenician woman who came to him and she's she's asking for healing for her daughter, remember? And he then says to her, he says to her, "It's not right. It's not meat for me to give the children's bread to dogs." &gt;&gt; She didn't ask for bread. She asked for healing for her daughter. Why is he talking about bread? But she picks up the revelation and says, "Yes, Lord, but we take the crumbs." &gt;&gt; She stays with the analogy of bread with him. She's got a revelation. She knows what he's talking about, right? She knows he's talking about himself. &gt;&gt; He is the bread for the children. &gt;&gt; I'm not meant for you, &gt;&gt; but Lord, we can benefit from the crumbs. She actually knew what the bread was. &gt;&gt; She understood. Okay. So, let's go to John chapter 6. Now, John chapter 6 from verse 4, you start to see where these thousands of people were there and people were, if you read all the way from John 6:4, you're going to see the story of where the 5,000 are fed. Right? So, I'm just going to give you quickly so we can get through each scripture. So the people follow him across Galilee after he's fed them because they're looking for more food, natural food, right? So if we read, Jesus took the loaves and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples. Now this is from verse 11. You can go home and read from verse 4. But from verse 11, he took the loaves and give thanks and so on and and uh it was and the fishes and it was multiplied over the 5,000. Verse 12. When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, "Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost." And when they gathered up, in other words, what was left over? These hungry poor people ate to their hearts content AND THERE WAS STILL SO MUCH LEFT over that they gathered up of the five bales which remain over and above 12 baskets. Then those men when they seen the miracle that Jesus said this is that true prophet that should come into the world. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Okay. So then we go to verse 26. Now they before we go there now they come to Jesus and they start asking him they want they want him to give them more food. But it was so uh devious. They saw him cross Galilee. They saw where his disciples were. They saw his disciples were not with him at a certain point and then they said, "Let's go. Let's go. Let's go across." So they they also all took boats and they went across the the sea and then they uh they meet up with Jesus and they said, "Hey, fancy meeting you here." Like, "Lord, when did you get here?" They went there w with false uh uh uh purpose as if to say, "Well, it's a coincidence. We arrived here, too. He's like, I know you skeleums in South Africa. See, I know you. You are seeking natural food. You're just following me around cuz you want your bellies filled. &gt;&gt; Well, that's not what he said, but that's what he meant, right? And then they want they want meat. In other words, prepared food. They want bread. Jesus answered and said, "Verily I say unto you, you seek me not because you saw the miracles, but because you did eat of the loaves and were filled." Now that you were satisfied. Labor not for the meat which perishes, but for the meat which endures unto everlasting life. Now watch this. Which the Son of man shall give unto you, for him that God that God the Father sealed. What are we looking at, saints? He's now telling you that the meat that perishes. Where did we see this in the Old Testament? Meat that perishes is mana, &gt;&gt; which came with a condition, &gt;&gt; which came with law. He says, "Your fathers ate that and are dead." &gt;&gt; They're not You're not just thinking about Moses. You're thinking about the Pharisees. They're taking the law and manipulating it and not realizing the same law that they're eating without the correct usage is bringing death to them. &gt;&gt; He says, "But there is a meat which gives everlasting life and it only is given by the son of man ministry." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE'RE ONLY GOING TO have meat or bread which gives eternal life if there is a son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; This is why today there has to be a son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; ANY OTHER TYPE of meat that you can take, you can preach the Bible till you blew in the face. &gt;&gt; It's going to become meat that perishes because it's not given by a son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So they listen to this and they ask him a question. Then said they unto him, "What shall we do that we might work the works OF GOD?" SO THEY'RE UNDERSTANDING WHAT HE'S SAYING. Are you with me? These people are not, they just been fed, so they should be understanding, right? And Jesus answered and said unto them, "This is the WORK OF GOD. THIS IS ALL THE WORK YOU must do. Believe on him whom he has sent." Oh my goodness. If ever we see something happening right now in our world in the message, they are no longer believing on him &gt;&gt; whom he has sent. &gt;&gt; This is the work you're supposed to have been doing. Believe on him whom he has sent. They said therefore unto him, "What sign? Show us thou then that we may see and believe." In other words, they realize, "Okay, okay. You're saying you're the person who has been sent. What sign can you show? Listen, please open your eyes and read. These people are not. They're church people. &gt;&gt; They're Bible readers. &gt;&gt; They're churchgoers. THEY KNOW WHAT he's saying. &gt;&gt; They're not misinterpreting him. &gt;&gt; When he says something like, "Believe on him whom he HAS SENT." HE'S SAYING THEY KNOW HE'S SAYING BELIEVE on me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no mystery there. They're understanding this. &gt;&gt; So then THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ASKING, "OKAY, if you want us to believe, you show us a sign. What sign can you produce that we might believe?" Which means the people want signs &gt;&gt; to believe the word. &gt;&gt; And the bride doesn't do that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The bride believes the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the signs follow. Yes. &gt;&gt; And if there's no signs, we still believe the word. Like the widow OF ZARAPATH, THERE'S NO SIGN. &gt;&gt; GO DO WHAT I TELL YOU. &gt;&gt; AND SHE DOES WHAT THE PROPHET TELLS HER AND THEN THE SIGN comes in &gt;&gt; and the oil and the meal does not diminish. &gt;&gt; But they want to sign first. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if the sign doesn't satisfy them, they reject the word, &gt;&gt; which is what's happening, &gt;&gt; right? So they said, now they're asking him for a sign that their fathers saw. And our fathers did eat mana in the desert. Our fathers ate what is it? &gt;&gt; Our fathers ate unrevealed food. &gt;&gt; Can you give us more unrevealed food? &gt;&gt; He gave them bread from heaven to eat. Now watch, they're becoming even more specific. Not just uh unrevealed food, not just the mana from heaven. We want bread from heaven. He gave them bread. In other words, he's saying, they're saying to him, can you bring mana? &gt;&gt; Can you show us bread from heaven? &gt;&gt; Then we'll believe you. In other words, they're even debating with him, &gt;&gt; the son of man, what kind of sign they would like for them to believe in him. Whoa. &gt;&gt; This generation, my Then Jesus said unto them, verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread &gt;&gt; from heaven, and my father giveth you the true bread from heaven. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT WHAT YOU GOT IN Moses was not even the real thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But what has come today is &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 33. And for the bread of God is he, THE BREAD OF GOD IS a person. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he discerns their falsehoods immediately. They are not really interested in the word. They just want to feed their stomachs. He said that Moses gave them natural manner. But the father gives true bread from heaven, the bread of God. There's the name of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was being revealed. The bread of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the bread of God, there's the the revelation of the bread of God. The bread of God is he which comes from heaven, &gt;&gt; which come down from heaven and giveth life unto the world. So then comes one of the most blatant and outright statements ever made by the Lord Jesus Christ. Listen, saints, go back home and read the story. John chapter 6. Read it all through. Read it with the Holy Spirit leading you. Okay? Read it like you're going to dissect every single verse out and put yourself in the place. When you read it, think of what they are asking. Think of how he's answering because this is what's happening today, right? So the next statement in verse 34, then said they unto him, Lord, ever more give us this bread. Which means the son of man brings out a revelation to say it's got to do with the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; It's got to do with the coming of the Lord. It's something that is like wetting their appetites. It is telling them it's at hand. and they're saying, "Okay, now we're talking. Lord, give us this bread." So, THEY'RE WILLING TO ACCEPT WHAT HE'S ABOUT TO GIVE THEM. THEY'RE PRIMED. THEY'RE SET FOR IT. IT'S ABOUT TO HAPPEN. HE TOLD THEM, "There's a vision. There's going to be something coming down from heaven and there's going to be bread and it's GOING TO BRING AN END TO THE FAMINE." LORD, ever more give us this bread. That's what all the sincere Christians in the world are saying. Lord, give us this bread. &gt;&gt; And then he does. And what happens? Right? So, I'm not going to read because it's going to take too long. From verse 35 to verse 40, he says to them, I am the bread. I am the bread of life. I am the bread that has come down from heaven. And then he explains to them who he is and what is his purpose. That's from verse 35 to verse 40. Verse 41 says they are offended that he identifies himself as the bread from heaven. There it is. This is what happens under the seventh seal. This is why there is a rejection of the third pole ministry &gt;&gt; because this is what it does. &gt;&gt; FIRST THEY'RE SAYING YES, YES, WE WANT THE BREAD. GIVE US MORE. We love this first pool and second pool and this we love all this. Give us this bread, Lord. And then he identifies it. THE SEVENTH SEAL BREAKS. HE IDENTIFIES WHO IT IS. &gt;&gt; And then they are offended. &gt;&gt; And they understood HIS WORD PERFECTLY. I came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; The bread the father gives is he which comes down from heaven. Lord, give us this bread. I am he which came down from heaven. Now what happens is verse 43 to verse 42 here's the the unbelief setting in how can he say this &gt;&gt; we know he's just the son of &gt;&gt; Joseph and Mary &gt;&gt; he's just a carpenter's son what does he mean he came from heaven we know he didn't come from heaven &gt;&gt; right and what happens is they're starting to get angry THEY JUST ASKED FOR IT EVER LORD, GIVE US THIS BREAD. HE'S NOW GIVING THEM THE BREAD. The bread which WILL GIVE THEM ETERNAL LIFE. THE MESSAGE IS ACTUALLY TELLING you what's going TO GIVE YOU ETERNAL LIFE. AND YOU'RE TURNING IT DOWN, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? And their reasoning kicks in. We know where you're from. We know all your story. &gt;&gt; We know all your inconsistency. We know your grammar. We know what you said there. We know where you came from. What do you mean you came from heaven? And then he drops the bomb. He tells them there's really nothing you can do about it. He said, "Don't worry. Don't stress your mind about it. There's no way you're going to get this anyway because in this the ones who are going to come are only those that my father draws. &gt;&gt; Don't stress about it. &gt;&gt; You go your way. There's nothing you can do to understand this &gt;&gt; because this is not for you. Right? And he says, "And thereafter, they're already angry. And now he hits him. The thunders breaks open, brother." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, he tells them, "You have to eat my flesh &gt;&gt; and drink my blood." &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; right? And it's crazy what happens. Verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me hath everlasting life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate mana in the wilderness and are dead. Whatever church you come from, WHATEVER DENOMINATION YOU HAVE, HOWEVER YOU EAT THE BIBLE, WHATEVER YOU DO WITH THE WORD, YOU HAVE CORRUPTED YOURSELF AND ENDED UP IN IDOLATRY. THEY ARE ALL DEAD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE bread which come down from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die. I am the living bread which come down from heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live forever. And the bread, THERE'S THE THUNDERS BUSTING OPEN. THE BREAD THAT I GIVE IS MY FLESH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AND WHICH WHICH I WILL GIVE FOR THE LIFE OF the world. Can you imagine how angry they while he's talking? &gt;&gt; The Jews therefore strove among themselves. How can this man give us his flesh to eat? &gt;&gt; And Jesus said unto them, "Verily, verily, I SAY UNTO YOU, EXCEPT YOU EAT THE FLESH OF THE SON OF MAN AND DRINK HIS BLOOD, you have no LIFE IN YOU." &gt;&gt; THIS SOUNDS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. HE'S NOT OFFERING EXPLANATIONS. &gt;&gt; They understood him before. &gt;&gt; What's the problem now? &gt;&gt; Right? When he spoken code before, they understood him perfectly. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you want us to believe you. Give us a sign. They understood it. But now he SAYS, "EAT MY FLESH AND drink my blood." That's why I always say to you, that's his third bull ministry. &gt;&gt; This is where everyone turns against him, including the 70. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even all THOSE PEOPLE YOU FIND AFTERWARD says and a lot of the disciples &gt;&gt; said this is too much. &gt;&gt; Those who walked with him a long time &gt;&gt; said this is too much. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We cannot take this. He now starts showing them showbread which is revealed word inviting them into the inner court &gt;&gt; and they cannot take it because of the leaven of the Pharisees. Why can they not understand THIS? BECAUSE THEY ARE DEFILED BY WOMEN &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY STILL HAVE SPIRIT OF ORGANIZED RELIGION. &gt;&gt; THEY WANT TO apply rules to the son of man. HE'S GOT TO BE TAKEN BACK TO DEUTERONOMY 18. HE'S GOT TO BE JUDGED BY THE SCRIPTURE. HE'S GOING TO BE THE You can't do this to a son of man ministry. And we're not talking about brother Brandham. We're talking about the son of man ministry. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEPARATE IT. Know what we're talking about. &gt;&gt; They cannot take it. He tells them if you only eat of natural food now, you will die. But what this means is if you only live by the first and second pool seeking signs and wonders. This is another thing happening in the message churches. They're trying to ask for signs. THEY'RE GOING BACK TO THAT OLD THING. THEY'RE FOLLOWING THEM ACROSS THE OCEAN. FEED OUR BELLIES. Give us MORE OF THAT EXCITING FOOD. GIVE US MORE OF THOSE signs and wonders. Give us more of that that message that makes us FEEL GOOD. THAT FEELGOOD MESSAGE. GIVE US THAT that we may BE FILLED. THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING. An evil generation seeketh after signs. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing wrong with signs, &gt;&gt; but believe the word first. &gt;&gt; Amen. take it. YOU MIGHT EVEN GO THROUGH many years without even seeing a single sign, &gt;&gt; but it's going to prove that you have taken the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is what happened to those in the wilderness. You can see this same mistake repeating in our day, saints. They are consistently searching for the meat that perishes. They're not seeking the bread that came down from heaven in our day. All right. So, let's go to our day. Oh, I forgot to read this. It gets even worse. As the living father sent, that's like a that's like a like a like swearing an oath. As the living father has sent me and I live by the father. He that eateth me. Like he's saying the same thing in a more horrific way. FIRST SAID, "EAT MY FLESH, DRINK MY BLOOD." NOW HE THAT EATETH ME, he shall live by me. This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead. This this uh the they ate mana which still had a question in it. WHAT IS IT? &gt;&gt; THIS THAT I'M GIVING TO YOU. THERE'S NO QUESTION IN IT. &gt;&gt; IF YOU EAT THIS BREAD, IT GIVES YOU THE ANSWER TO THE DEVIL'S QUESTION. &gt;&gt; HE THAT EATETH of this bread shall live forever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which brings us to our day. So everybody in closing, what about our day? Who is the bread of God for your day? Who is the bread OF GOD? NOT WILLIAM BRANDOM. &gt;&gt; For all the skeptics, that's not what we're saying. &gt;&gt; It's the son of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the son of man who came down from heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is the mystery under the seventh seal. This is what people deny when the word is identified before them. They do the same thing. Aren't you just a man? &gt;&gt; Aren't you the son of so and so? &gt;&gt; Didn't you say this? Didn't you do we know what are you making of yourself? &gt;&gt; And they're offended by the third pole. They want it. &gt;&gt; Reveal to us THE SEVENTH SEAL. WHEN IT is revealed, &gt;&gt; we're offended. Can you do you believe? Let's go to reveal. Let's see showbread in our day. Right. Here we go. Revealed word. What this is unveiling of God paragraph 333. What's the shakina of glory today? To break beyond the veil to see who God is standing before you. See who God is standing before us. The pillar of fire. He is veiled in human flesh. But what does the shikina what did it do? The showbread seed. The word that we're to live on in this day by these promises, the shakina glory ripens that showbread brings it to pass, makes it bread to the believer that laid in the pages of the Bible. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAR AFTER YEAR FOR THIS AGE. SO WHAT'S HE TELLING US? OKAY, let's read on. To the denominations is a stumbling block. To the denominations they stumble at it down through the years. What's he talking about? Luther, Wesley, Martin Luther, Sanki, Finny, John Smith, NOX ALL STUMBLED AT WHAT? written word &gt;&gt; that was not ripened. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because it was not brought into the inner court under the light of the messengers. &gt;&gt; Right. So what's it to be done in the last days? What is it? What is to reveal? To bring forth. So showbread is taking the written word that was not revealed putting it under revelation light and let the written word bring forth. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you don't bring the Bible into the Holy of Holies, you're not going to understand the written word. &gt;&gt; We have showbread today. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we have that. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. To turn what watch it ripen and produce just exactly what it said it would do, the showbread for this age to the denomination a stumbling block, a bunch of fanatics. But we who believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have been invited into the inner court by the message of the hour. Without the light of the candlesticks, the message of the inner court, the Bible would just remain theory AND STORIES FOR GENERATIONS. But under the light of Malachi 4, it ripens into showbread. This is why your Bible speaks. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it becomes alive. SO THEN HE TAKES US FROM showbread now and now he takes us into behind the veil right listen I could go to hidden life the message hidden life and talk to you about the what Moses brings out from the golden POT WE COULD DO all that we'll spend so much of time on that but I don't want to I want to get to what's happening in our day right are you feeding on the flesh of the son of man &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; because that's what he said in John 6 &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; if you have to eat my flesh and drink my blood. Right? He obviously was not talking about it literally. We saw that man cannot live by bread alone, natural food. So the bread he was TALKING ABOUT WAS SPIRITUAL FOOD. &gt;&gt; He was So let me let me put it to you this way. Here's here's WHAT HE WAS HERE'S WHAT JESUS was saying to them in John 6. You now have to take the word that I give you only. Any other word is not going to give you eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any other blood will not save you. Any other sacrifice will not give you salvation for your transgressions. All salvation and nourishment of the word comes through me cuz I came down from heaven. That's what he told them. &gt;&gt; They knew that and rejected it. &gt;&gt; Right now, the flesh of the son of man, anointed ones of the end time. Uh he says paragraph 269. Now, I want you to know this is short that you listen to this tape. You might have thought today that I was trying to say that about myself. For all those who said he was saying it about himself, he actually says I was not. Being that I was packing this message, I have no more to do with it than nothing. No more than just a voice. SO I'VE GOT NOTHING ELSE TO do with it except my voice is being used. &gt;&gt; See, don't be those who knows what he's saying and then rejects it. You know what he's saying, right? And my voice even against my better judgment. In other words, I feel like he could have used somebody else. I wanted to be a trapper, but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and determined to do. I wasn't the one that appeared down the river. I was only standing there when it happened. I'm not uh the one that, let me see where I am. I WAS ONLY STANDING THERE. I'M NOT THE one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are. I'm only the one that's near when he does it. I was only the voice that he used to say it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't what I knew. It's what I just surrendered myself to &gt;&gt; that he spoke through. It isn't me. It wasn't the seventh angel. Oh, no. It was the manifestation of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; It's been said, &gt;&gt; who is the only one that can give you the bread from heaven? the son of man. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; it wasn't me. He says, I was the only one standing. That was only the voice. &gt;&gt; It It was the manifestation of the son of man. &gt;&gt; Right? It wasn't It wasn't Jesus from 2,000 years ago. &gt;&gt; It was Jesus manifesting himself through a vessel. &gt;&gt; That was the manifestation &gt;&gt; of the son of man. &gt;&gt; It wasn't the angel his message. It was it was the uh the mystery that God um unfolded. It's not a man, &gt;&gt; it's God. &gt;&gt; See, this is what they stumble at. This is John 6 happening. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; Because now today, what they're saying is, "How can you call yourself God? &gt;&gt; We know who you are." Amen. &gt;&gt; When he says it's not a man, it's God. In his mind, he's being told to say what he has to say. &gt;&gt; What he has to say is going to make many reject it. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And only the few who will accept it. &gt;&gt; IT IS SPOKEN IN THIS WAY so that it will challenge their hearts and only those who believe will receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what are you going to believe? THE RIGHT THING. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE THE ONE SAYING YOU'RE JUST a man. &gt;&gt; You're making yourself more. You and I who believe are saying we're looking beyond this man. &gt;&gt; We know he's just a man. &gt;&gt; But we see beyond the veil. THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE STANDING THERE. AND THAT'S THE VOICE THAT'S SPEAKING TO ME INSIDE. Because this man with all his confusion can have no ability TO EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE right now. This has to be somebody else. I can see behind the veil. &gt;&gt; The son of man, he goes on, is Christ. He's the one that you're feeding on. &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT JOHN 6 HERE. &gt;&gt; This is, dare I say, supernatural taking place here BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME REVELATION of John 6 happening. &gt;&gt; You're not feeding on a man. a man, his words will fail, but you're feeding on the unfailing body word &gt;&gt; of the son of man. HE'S ACTUALLY saying you're feeding on the flesh, &gt;&gt; the same words, &gt;&gt; body, word &gt;&gt; of the son of man. &gt;&gt; If you haven't fed on every word to give yourself strength to fly by all these denominations and things of the world, you will you at this time do it while we pray. This is exactly John chapter 6, saints of God. It is a call to move away from meat that perishes and take that which gives eternal life. The Pentecostal movement abused it until it roted. Now they're asking for it again. But under the seventh seal, we see the open book come down from heaven. A mighty angel descends with the cloud. Amen. And an open book in his hand. This is the meat that does not perish. THIS IS THE UNFAILING BODY WORD OF THE SON OF MAN. AND REVELATIONS 10:8 SAYS WHAT? Take the book and eat. &gt;&gt; Eat the book and prophesy. This is the unfailing body word of the son of man. If you take everything in John chapter 6, it is an absolute indictment of this generation. Even those in the message who will not go further with the word and who do not recognize this coming. Lastly, spiritual food in due season. It is he says it is not. He's speaking of the sirenian women. It is not me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs. Didn't Jesus say the same thing to the sirenian woman? He was sent to his own. That is right. That's who it who he come. He never went to the to the Gentiles. Now today he visits the Gentiles in their time. It's not meat. You say why is it's not meat. You say why is the message don't go out in these great big places these big crusades like among the denomination. Are you ready for it? &gt;&gt; It's not their food. &gt;&gt; It's not the church so-called food. &gt;&gt; It's the bride food. &gt;&gt; It's spiritual food in season. IT WOULD MAKE THEM SICK AT THEIR STOMACH. It's too rich for them. See, you you can't do it. But for the children, it's bread. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's life. It's Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; It's bread. &gt;&gt; If you thought you didn't know the name bread of God, you had a prophet in this day who said to you, "This food that is bride food, it is bread for the children. THIS IS CHILDREN'S BREAD. THIS IS THE BREAD THAT came down FROM HEAVEN. THIS IS THE FLESH OF THE SON OF MAN THAT WE ARE EATING. THIS IS THE LIFE OF HIS OWN BODY THAT HE GIVES FOR US TO EAT. HIS BLOOD TO DRINK. His life to take in for us. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. This food cannot be digested by people who want to remain in Pentecost and searching for signs. They could only preach using buzzwords. Seven thunders, seven seal, SEVEN THIS, SEVENTH THAT, THIRD POLE. JUST BUZZWORDS AND BUZZWORDS AND NO REVELATION BEHIND IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT FEEDING ON THE BODY word of the son of man. &gt;&gt; THEY JUST WANT SIGNS. THEY WANT TO USE THE BUZZWORDS to create anointing to see signs. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But when you give IT TO THEM, WHEN YOU TELL THEM THIS IS WHAT IT SAYS, THIS IS WHAT IT MEANS. THIS IS WHAT IT IS. They can't digest it. THEY GET ANGRY. THEY STILL WANT SENSATIONS and signs from heaven. This is bright food, saints. It is the bread of life. The bread had that come down FROM HEAVEN. THE NAME JESUS CHRIST REVEALED TO US IN A MORE PERSONAL WAY the bread of God. &gt;&gt; So what do you have TO DO? WHAT IS YOUR JOB TODAY? Young people, older people who if you if you're growing cold, what is the job today? Right? 1 Corinthians 5:7 to8. Purge out therefore the old leaven that you may be a new lump as you are unleavened. FOR EVEN CHRIST OUR PASSOVER IS SACRIFICED FOR US. THEREFORE, LET US KEEP THE FEAST, NOT WITH OLD LEAVEN, NEITHER with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. Take the lamb of Christ. KEEP THE PASSOVER FEAST WITH UNLEAVENED BREAD. You can't take the lamb with LEAVEN BREAD. &gt;&gt; IT'S AGAINST THE LAW. &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE THE LAMB WITH UNLEAVENED BREAD. &gt;&gt; That's what you got to do. SO, WHAT IS THAT? WHAT IS 11 OF THE PHARISEES? ORGANIZED RELIGION. &gt;&gt; If you want to to to receive this bread, YOU'VE GOT TO KICK OUT ALL OF ORGANIZED RELIGION. Take the lamb first with unleavened bread and then you receive the son of man, the meat which does not perish. That's what you've got to do. Get rid of leodyianism, Pentecostalism. Do not seek and run after signs and the meat which perishes. Listen, every single sign that is given becomes corrupted. Yes, &gt;&gt; I don't care. Let's say you got a heal of some great healing. &gt;&gt; Eventually over time after telling that story a 100 times the story is corrupted. &gt;&gt; It's never the same. More is added TO IT. MORE DETAILS are given. Suddenly you become someone spiritual that people need to come to advice just because you were healed. That's what happens with signs. Look at the true sign overlooked. What is the true sign overlooked? The word made flesh. The book that has come down to earth again. The body word of the son of man sent here for one purpose. What is the message? WHAT IS THIS MESSAGE WHICH came down from heaven with the the the body word of the son of man? What is its purpose? One purpose to make you him. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's a scripture that tells you that. &gt;&gt; It's you don't even you don't even need to interpret it. It's so blatant. And we'll close with this. For we being many are one bread. &gt;&gt; What is bread? Bread is for others to eat &gt;&gt; and one body. For we ARE ALL PARTAKERS OF THAT ONE BREAD. &gt;&gt; So the whole point of Christianity salvation &gt;&gt; is that by you feeding on him, you become him that others may feed on. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF IT. &gt;&gt; WHY DO WE NEED to receive the son of man ministry right now? Because if we become him, others can feed on that which we can give them. &gt;&gt; Amen. We being many become one bread because we feed on that one bread. &gt;&gt; Glory to God, saints. &gt;&gt; Let us stand together. Praise be to his precious name. &gt;&gt; Amen and amen. Don't you love him, saints? &gt;&gt; Let us pray. I want you to see that partaking of this one bread, the bread of God came down from heaven.
