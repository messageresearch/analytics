TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. And amen. Amen. While you're standing, we're going to read in our Bibles or you can follow on the screen from 1 Peter 1:3-5. 1 Peter chapter 1:3-5. And the word of God reads like this. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Two, begotten us unto a lively hope from the dead. By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, we are begotten to verse four to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you, who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. The Lord add a blessing to his word. You may be seated. Praise be to God. Greetings saints in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Certainly good to be with all of you this morning and to share the word of the Lord with you. Thankful to brother Liam for last week had some good reports about the services. So we appreciate the gifts of God in the church and u thankful to God for the ministries of our brothers and we appreciate all of you. And we had a good time with the saints in Newcastle as well. It was uh a good trip and uh we are thankful that there are uh saints standing up for the faith. Amen. In these last days, good to see brother Shadrach and his family back from the dead. Uh they were sick with the these these flu that were going around I think this this winter was terrible. It's just I got uh reports from all kinds of people just it wasn't just a flu. you were like flat on your back laid out and uh coughing and wheezing and not you know wondering whether you're going to wake up but we're thankful to God that we are restored. Amen. &gt;&gt; So uh and I know some of the little ones you know take a real impact with these uh with these um sicknesses. But anyway, we're really thankful to be back in the presence of the Lord. And once again, I'm, you know, I'm wanting to um move on in the series and get back to the name of God and and uh but there there seems to be a um uh a shift happening all over and there's like a real there's an excitement among some a lot of people in the message and then there's a there's a on the other hand there's just people falling away like terrible So, um, but we we press on. We we've got to do what God is calling us to do. &gt;&gt; We've got to speak the word. We've got to trust that the Lord does what is necessary for his people. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh, I I think I I hope I'm going to be speaking on the question and answers on the Holy Ghost. This going to be part three and, uh, hopefully this is going to be the last questions on it. But so not really a question from anybody, but we're going to get into that in a little while. Uh something we picked up many years ago. But so it has occurred to me since speaking on the Holy Ghost recently and uh sanctification and uh conversations that I've been having with people uh that have resulted since then. I've realized exactly how much religious indoctrination has weakened the true Christian experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there still remains a lot of confusion in people regarding the first and the simplest steps toward salvation. And uh no matter sometimes how much you can break it down to people, the questions that are still there, I can tell are there from religious traditions. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. It's like they just don't want to let go. Like like the worm is pulling you but there's like one little hook left, you know, and you're like, "But what about that?" So, um, and it just it's very concerning for me that people cannot identify their experience correctly because that's that's like the main thing. It's like, "Bro, how do I know I've got the Holy Ghost?" Then you give them an answer. Thank you. They walk away. You can see gingerely like a cat moving away. But that one hook still remaining. But what about you know and um the thing about it is when you don't know what you've experienced and you can't identify your experience um this leads to you know um like failures it and and uncertainty and and eventually over a period of time it it results in loss of faith and I'm not saying loss of complete the the faith I'm just saying loss of faith and I was talking to my little boy yesterday and I was explaining to him the difference when you're a person who lives by faith and when you live by doubt. When you live by doubt and doubt takes over you, you are nervous. You are you are literally expecting everything to be bad. You are literally expecting um to go somewhere and and you're just your view of life is just negative. But when you live by faith, your life is positive. Amen. &gt;&gt; Your expectation is positive. And even when things go bad, you still you still think of the positive thing that that came out of the negative thing. &gt;&gt; That's a person who lives by faith, whose heart is filled with light. And and so that's what happens when you live in doubt of your salvation, of your experience with God. Then your entire existence in the message becomes one that's filled with nervousness. what people are going to say, what others are going to say, you know, uh, am I doing this right? Am I going to make the rapture? Am I really the bride? Which part am I? Am I just the church? Am I the foolish virgin? You know, it's it's just incredible the things that that people are struggling with today. So, they are plagued with so many questions because doubt has taken over. And there are even questions like how could I have lost faith? Uh, did Listen to this. How could I've lost faith? If I've lost faith now, does it mean I didn't have true faith in the beginning? &gt;&gt; You know, you you you can lose faith purely because bad things happened &gt;&gt; and it doesn't really mean anything. It just means a bad thing happened to you and you're a normal person after all. &gt;&gt; You thought you were an angel. just didn't realize you were flesh and blood human being and bad things happen to you and once in a while you have a bad day and at that day you you feel like I don't want to pray I don't want to read that's normal &gt;&gt; and at that day your faith can be low that's when you need the body to pick you up again or somebody to give you a call or somebody shares a scripture and then your faith comes back up everyone goes through that day brother Brandon said he went through that day he speaks about a juniper tree experience I mean, if ever you saw a prophet, one of the prophets, I mean, any one of them with the spirit of Elijah looked like they were depressed half the time. &gt;&gt; So, that's what I'm saying. This this question like, if I lost faith now in this trial, does that mean I never really had faith in the beginning? That is the enemy putting doubt in your mind. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Now, I would like to speak on something that we picked up many years ago. Now you know this is the the treasure of spending time taking the cood books and going through all those questions with your people is you already pick up all the questions and uh you you then develop questions on those questions but just picking up the questions of the people in those days helped us to to go into things in the message. So uh what looked like a simple question turned out to be a phenomenal understanding that had to do with our experience with God and it highlighted so many things that we took for granted and some things we didn't uh we did not care to even know. So let's start by reading the question question and answers part four. This is 1964 30th of August. I hope you can read that 403 question 403. The question, this person's question is just amazing. For 1964, listen carefully. When you use the expression that if we do not believe the word, we will be eternally separated from Christ, do you mean the foolish virgin will live eternally, but they will be separated from the new Jerusalem where Christ will dwell with the bride? &gt;&gt; That's the first question. Most people pass over that question. Look at that. Because the prophet spoke about being eternally separated and we know he also says you can't be in hell and be eternal. &gt;&gt; This person understood you're not speaking about the people in hell being eternally separated. You're speaking about those people outside the city. &gt;&gt; And this is very good because the people outside the city did not have the same experience with God that we have. &gt;&gt; Right? So eternally separate. So for eternity will not be a part of the new Jerusalem but be the nations on the outside. But here's where it gets to what I want to talk about because then he says uh the question says here are those who do not have the Holy Spirit born again as the scripture speaks of being born again. So there are people who have received the new birth foolish virgin not the way the scripture speaks of right. &gt;&gt; And then it says if the natural birth requires water, blood and spirit, does not the spiritual require all three stages of grace before the person is truly born again? Amazing question, right? Now first I would like to say this question you know just completely amazing the the person seems to be more interested in uh the um the prophets um or rather um uh in in in the prophet's statements that he made about eternal separation and uh no eternal hell right and and about being eternally separated from Christ. That that looks like the question the person is asking that looks like what is paramount like the person wants to know does this fit in with that and is it because of the new birth like for example how can you have the full uh um justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and then be a foolish virgin like what's what's up with that and the person is asking like how can it be that these people are allowed to live eternally could it mean that they did not have a new birth the way it is scripturally spoken of. That's a brilliant question, right? You might not think so. I certainly think so. But uh we know there is no such thing as eternal hell because to be in hell for eternity requires eternal life. So if you have eternal life, you have the life of God. And if you have the life of God, what are you doing in hell? &gt;&gt; So we know that cannot be. So the person is rightly asking if eternal uh separation is linked to the foolish virgin and the nations without the holy city, the new Jerusalem and they are given eternal life but separated from the city. Right? Secondly, they seem to be linking the three stages of grace to the first question, right? justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, the person of Christ and linking that to the first question as if this may be the reason why they are eternally separated and not being a part of the city. Everyone got that? &gt;&gt; And then comes the prophet's answer which has nothing to do with what the person asked. And we're so used to that. It's incredible. Let's see. Let's go to his answer. He says, "Absolutely. Absolutely." What? I just explained that this morning. The same thing. The same thing. You've got to have all stages. You're begotten of the spirit just like a baby's begotten into the womb of a mother, but not born until they receive the Holy Ghost. That's right. You're born then. You're not converted. You're in a procession of being converted until that time. Right. The next one, that's the reason that all these great mysteries. Oh, this is amazing. That's the reason these great mysteries could not be given to Luther. Could not be given to Wesley, could not be given to that age that has just passed by us. The Pentecostal, which mean the mysteries could not be given to Luther, Wesley, and Pentecost. Why? I'm also asking why. It wasn't time. Here it is. They were begotten. They were begotten. He says there are three stages. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Begotten, born and converted. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He's saying those other three ages were just begotten. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now the person of Christ himself, the son of man, you understand? Revealing himself in human flesh. It could not have come till now &gt;&gt; 1964. All right. So, his answer doesn't seem to answer the questions, but when you go between the lines, you get right. So, this brings me to my title. Uh, and uh uh the next the next one. Yeah. And one more. There we go. So, my title is begotten, born, and then converted. Okay. So, this is what we picked up many, many, many years ago. begotten, born and then converted. Now, his his answer seems to answer the question um on a completely different tangent. And you've got a lot of people in the message who when you speak of the three stages, they talk about justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. Here is something completely different. I mean, it's linked to it, but he's saying your stages of growth of your salvation has got to do with being begotten, being born and converted. &gt;&gt; He says Luther, Wesley, and Pentecost were only in the begotten stage. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why the mysteries could not be revealed to them. &gt;&gt; And that's what we'd like to understand. So, I'd like to flesh this out. &gt;&gt; Yes. so that you can understand your experience and you can know what's happening around us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So speaking in 1964 towards the end of the ministry and after the revealing of the seals he then indicates that if the natural birth requires three stages does not the spiritual birth require three stages of grace before the person is truly truly born again. Amen. So he says, so there's the three stages. I want to put this up on the screen for you. Number one is begotten of the spirit. Is it not there? Okay, don't worry about that. We'll we'll get back to that. Begotten of the spirit, born when you receive the Holy Ghost, and number three, the process of conversion. All right. So what amazes me is he identifies each stage as having a different experience. Not to be confused with the others. Everyone got that? &gt;&gt; Begotten is an experience. Born is an experience and conversion is an experience. Three different experiences. You could be living in either one. You could have been going through either one. The one most im important thing is you cannot go through the first the last one without the first one. You can't the you cannot be born unless you were begotten. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And you definitely can't be converted without having been begotten. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So this is what amazes me. He identifies each stage as having a different experience. Now it's very plain to see today that people are always confusing the stages. In other words, they have only um begotten. They're they maybe they are begotten. They're living in a begotten stage, but they think they've been born. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; And and and this is what I want to bring to you. It's amazing because this begotten stage is an amazing stage. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's beautiful. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brilliant. &gt;&gt; It's full of emotions. I'm going to describe it to you. But most people think they have been born again &gt;&gt; and they've just been begotten. But so that to me is uh is amazing. It's wonderful. But the most amazing of all that he says is the revelation of the mysteries only takes place in the conversion stage &gt;&gt; not in the begotten state. The mysteries cannot be revealed to you when you are begotten. &gt;&gt; And so we like to understand that. So let's come back to that scripture. 1 Peter, just the slide before this, right? There we go. 1 Peter 3:5. So, watch what he says. Um, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again. Okay, which means he's telling you the word again means you've already been begotten, but now you are being begotten again. So, when was the first time? The first time you were begotten in your mother's womb, &gt;&gt; physically, literally, but now you are begotten again by the spirit, right? While in these bodies of flesh, that means you've actually as a man or woman in this life. You have been born, you've grown up, you're you're a you're an adult, and now you're being born again. &gt;&gt; What does that mean? &gt;&gt; You've been begotten again. He starts there. He doesn't even say you're born again. He says you're begotten again. You've been conceived again. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. So, this is the reality I want to get to. Okay. And the the reality of this in our lives gets lost on us. I don't know you could probably see I'm really enjoying this already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, and when we, you know, when we use spiritual language, we use religious language, we use uh Christian traditional language, we lose this. we lose the reality. It it it looks like we're talking about a salvation experience like it's something airy fairy, you know, like it's something so spiritual and you can only talk about it with like music playing or something, you know, and that uh it's it's in your imagination. It's actually so real &gt;&gt; that takes place with you in your life. You can you can um you can describe it in your in your actual uh reality, right? So that's what gets lost and that's what I don't like about the Christian experience must be real to you. &gt;&gt; It must be some it mustn't be something in your imagination. It's got to be real. Amen. So when you were conceived in the womb of your mother, you were a new beginning, right? When you were a little seed in the womb of your mother, you were that was your new beginning. Okay? It was a start of who you are today. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Right? So you you are with me literally in the same room today. But long time ago, you were just a little seed in the womb of mom. Okay? And then you started to grow in them. It was that was the start of who you are today. From there, from mom, you were born and then you left mom. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You came out of the womb, you were born. You see the difference between begotten and born, &gt;&gt; right? So now you're leaving mom's body. You come out and now when you are born, you're starting to be educated because you are born this new clean page waiting to be written on. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. And so you start to be educated and now the problem is from the time you are you are born you start to see this world you're living in your your page is being written on with worldliness with things of the world with the education of this life. Right? And you are now being educated. And then you grow up. You become a teenager. You become an adult. And then you meet the gospel. You meet the word. And what happens is you become reconceived. &gt;&gt; Yes. Right. &gt;&gt; That's it. You literally have to become reconceived because your entire spirit has to be reprogrammed. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what it means to be begotten again. You can't skip that process. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You literally have to be begotten, right? And then a new or rather a restart occurs. What is that? This is what I'm saying. The the reality of it must get you. You came, let's say you received the message when you were 21. Do you know what your your mentality, your spirit, your your view of life, your I you know I don't know what star you were born under. You were Sagittarius, you were Capricorn, whatever you were, you came with all those things, all that baggage and you you met the Holy Ghost. You met the word of God and now you are being born again. You are being begotten again. you're you're going back to and that's why Nicodemus asked, "Does a man have to go back into the womb of his mother to be born again?" He said, "No, but it's going to come by water, blood, and spirit." &gt;&gt; But it's nonetheless a reconception of yourself, &gt;&gt; of your spirit, a reprogramming, a restart. A lot of people come to this message and don't get the restart. &gt;&gt; You want the prophet's message. You want to read the books, but you don't want the restart. &gt;&gt; You have to be begotten. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And have your spirit cleansed from the from the education you already achieved. &gt;&gt; Right. Being renewed in your spirit is to be re-educated by the spirit of God. And that's where they stop. Right? This is the reality of it. And I think that the phrase born again like uh people in the Pentecostal church, you know, they meet you at a bus station or bus stop, they meet you at work or something, or they see you randomly in the street and they walk up to you and are you born again? Right? We like those guys better than the 7day Adventist and Jehovah's Witnesses because you know these guys preach a short sermon. are you born again? And most likely they leave you after they pray for you and shake your head a little bit. And uh but this idea of being born again has been hijacked by this Pentecostal church. It's like they own the phrase. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And all the Pentecostal church movements have become somewhat of this this experience of being converted from sinner to Christian. That's what they call being born again. being converted from a sinner to a Christian. All you have to do is say the sinner's prayer. You were a sinner yesterday and today you are a Christian. Converted. See? All right. And that's where they stop. That phrase can be used for anything. Uh for example, if you studied economics, I feel sorry for you. You know, it's boring in school. And then you decide to go into mechanical engineering which is a lot more exciting. And uh that's conversion. You converted from economics to mechanical engineering. Right? Conversion. You basically had a restart in education. You left economics and you went to mechanical engineering. You had a re-education into a new faculty. It's that simple. But that's where they stop at the re-education. That's where their excitement remains. They're they're having a party. They're having a jubilee. I've been re-educated. Praise the Lord. All that means is you took me away from the thinking of being a sinner or some other religion and you're now giving me the thinking of being a Christian. Hallelujah. Verse three tells us that we have been reconceived to a lively hope. That's where uh in the in the Bible the the word lively refers to being born and having the breath of life. He became God breathed into him the breath of life and he became a living soul. You are lively stones. Living is manifested having the breath of life in you. Amen. So we have been begotten unto a lively hope. That's what 1 Peter 1:3-5 tells us. Are you with me? And it also refers to something being manifested. So it's indicating not just an inward experience but an outward manifestation, something real. So it doesn't matter uh you know when you are begotten there is an outward manifestation when you are born again there is an outward manifestation when you are converted there is an outward manifestation there has to be a hope a lively hope it's not in your hand &gt;&gt; you don't say I'm begotten and then live like you did before you don't say I'm born again and live like you did before just living the same old me but yay I've been born here. Okay. And then it says in verse four, to a theophony. Of course, it doesn't say that, but we know it says that. To an inheritance incorruptible, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; reserved in heaven for you. How do we know it's a theophony? Because verse 5 says, who is ready to be revealed in the last days? &gt;&gt; It's a person. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Are you with me? So ready to be revealed in the last day means it's ready to be made known or manifest. That lively hope that theophony is reserved incorruptible. It's eternal in the heavens for you waiting to be revealed in the last day which comes under your seven thunders and coming out of seven seals. Are you with me? Now this literally tells us that our theophanes that are they are ready to be revealed in the last the end time. So I want to go through this three stages. I want to go through begotten, born and converted. Right? Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spiritual stages of our experience. And I want to make it plain to us so that we never have to doubt what it is we're going through in our stages of our life. So let's start with our restart, our re-education when we were conceived again. All right? And so, you know, that's what I want to challenge you on. You can't come to God and say, "I've been begotten." And then still come here with your own ideas, your old ideas, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's really ridiculous. You You have to understand that when you become uh when you are conceived again by the Holy Spirit, you become a new person. We're not you're not coming here to rehash some denominational ideas from 500 years ago like when I you meet some Orthodox Christians and they're literally living like as if they need to be in some cathedral in the Holy Land with clots over them holding a candle and swinging a ball and chain with smoke coming out of it. They might as well be that because they have literally no message for this day. &gt;&gt; Nothing. It's dead. It's literally what you know that whitened sephil car filled with dead men's bones. &gt;&gt; It's literally that type of Christianity. There is nothing in there. &gt;&gt; Like if you ask those people, you see this this little nun with this cloth over her head and she's wrapped up to everywhere. All you can see is this part of her face and you know she's got this holy Bible and she's and you ask her, "Sister, how do we overcome social media? Nothing. They literally have nothing. Oh, come. I'll pray for you, my son. They have no message. None of them. They're what I don't understand. If you defect to a denomination, you cannot tell me their message is better. &gt;&gt; There is literally nothing in the denomination. &gt;&gt; That's right. I I'll I'll tell you if you go there, you'll get like maybe 15 minutes of uh of preaching if you're lucky and then you'll get some politics and standup comedy. That's what you'll get. There's literally no message. So, if you defect from the message to go to a denomination, uh it's very clear something was wrong with you before that. There's there's no way you can tell me you're going to someplace better because what the message gives you. I'm telling you today what we preaching on is from one quote, one statement that you must be begotten, born and converted. Nobody else has said that. &gt;&gt; Nobody in the world since the beginning of Christianity. &gt;&gt; So begotten. Amen. You can now put that weird picture up on the screen. All right. So, begotten is when you you have been conceived in your mother's belly. You can see that you look like an alien, right? There's there's nothing goodlooking about that. It looks awful. Looks terrible. But that in itself is a beautiful experience. &gt;&gt; Yes. Only mothers find that cute, right? To me, you go there and you pay like so much for those scans, 40 scans and whatever. And you look at this blob there, you know, and oh, it's so cute, so precious. Look, listen to all the ladies going for us. It looks like some kind of jelly monster, right? That's what it looks like. We all were that once upon a time. &gt;&gt; But begotten as we understand from what brother man teaches refers to our spiritual conception becoming sons of God. Right? You with me? No man can come to me except my father draws him. &gt;&gt; There can be no conception but be uh without a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Without your father's seed, there is no conception. &gt;&gt; Right? The father has to draw you. So, brother said, "You didn't seek God." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He sought you. &gt;&gt; He says, "There's no man in the world who says, "I was searching for God." You can say, "You felt like it." That feeling you had that you were searching for God was God brooding over you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because he said in your natural state, you only desire what you want. &gt;&gt; You only desire to serve the pleasures of the flesh. If you felt any time in your life that you were searching for God, he already found you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's your experience. He found you and then you thought you were searching for it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then when he found you, you were still not begotten. It was still coming up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So he starts brooding over you and bringing the word your way. Now what's God brooding over you? This is lovely. Car crash, sickness, family problem, like awful situation. And you're like, you wake up in a day somewhere. What is what is wrong with my life? What is going on? Why is this happening to me? All the time you just go in and bang in your head, bang in your head. All it's doing is making things happen so you can wake up and say, "I need God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I need God. This there's something wrong here. Something not right. And then this is God brooding over you. And then you feel like, "Wow, what a coincidence." On this particular time, there's somebody there who's waiting to ask you the question. Have you heard about the message? You look like you need help. You know what? Have you read this book? Do you know about this prophet? Just look like a random person standing there. In the meantime, God was already working one year before you hit this spot. &gt;&gt; This is where the conception begins. This is where the seed gets revived. The gene seed that was in is excited and when it starts being conceived inside you, right? So uh he starts brooding over you and bringing the word your way for you to make your choice. The conception begins when you make your choice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't force himself on you, right? &gt;&gt; So when you make your choice and you accept Christ then and you accept the word for your day, then the gene seed in your soul begins to stir. That means you can be even sitting in a message church under message parents for 20 years and never be begotten. &gt;&gt; You've been sitting under an experience cuz you haven't made the choice yet. When the choice takes place inside you, then a life begins, right? And your soul begins to stir. And then brother Pam likens that in the natural birth and the life growing within a pregnant woman. So when you made the choice, it's like you're still inside mama. You're not born yet. You just made a choice. The seed has just started. Are you with me? So that's what I want to break out. I'm going to show you what that experience is. So the seed growing inside the baby starting to develop inside the mother. That gene seed attribute which has been sewn starts to develop within you the same as a fetus develops in the womb of its mother. Right? You you're getting a reset now. Now inside the womb, are you with me? Does he know mommy? No. Does he know daddy? No. Does he know who he is? No. He's got no identity, but he's definitely having an experience. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he's having an experience of his life, &gt;&gt; right? And yet he doesn't know mommy, daddy. He doesn't even know himself. But he's begotten. One thing's for sure, he's alive. He's begotten. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. And this is now after you wake up from this car accident. You met someone down the line in the hospital. I'm just making up some random stuff. You get in the hospital, you meet some nurse there who gives you a message book. You're reading. You can't do anything else cuz your leg is broken and you're lying on your back. Best time reading a book and then look on the other side, you see somebody's address and a phone number. You know what? Let's give it a shot. I'm miserable right now. What could go wrong? Phone them. Hey, brother. So and so okay don't worry we'll be there sprite next morning the message people are around your bed you know giving you the word next thing you know you're in church who are you still don't know &gt;&gt; you don't know daddy you don't know mommy you don't know anything but something is happening &gt;&gt; life is beginning &gt;&gt; right that's when you are begotten you are being reconceived what's going to happen is they're going to drag you into their church, you're going to walk in amongst all these happy, clappy strangers who dress so weirdly and it's strange and they sit and listen to services for like 2 hours. Like what's up with that? You know, you still don't know who you are. You still have no identity. You think, "Oh, okay. It's just another Christian church. What makes them so special?" Oh, yeah. You know, they they believe in Jesus Christ. And who's this the quotes they read? You know, who's this Brandham guy? And you know, like what's this cloud? Everyone has this weird white thing on them, you know, this cloud thing and these books they all read. You still don't know who you are. You still don't know anything. But nonetheless, you can't deny there's something about this place. &gt;&gt; There's some feeling. There's some excitement. There's some and then you think, well, that was interesting. After the first service, you go away and somehow these people seem to be calling you all week. You know, we're just checking on you. Are you okay? Hey, is everything fine? You need anything? You know, and then you realize and you might be going through this. You know what? My whole family, I'm stuck in hospital, my leg up in a thing, I'm on a stretcher or whatever, and my family, my friends, my own Pentecostal church doesn't check on me. And these new crazy people, they're on my case all the time. They're caring, they're visiting, they're bringing me food. You know, they're You still don't know mommy. You still don't know daddy. You still don't know who you are but something is taking place &gt;&gt; right and you then they start talking to you and they start telling you stuff. So this is where what is the conception? What is being begotten? You start to have a personal experience where you start realizing my life was being lived all wrong &gt;&gt; up to this point. And this fascinating idea starts to possess you that you should be different. Been living my life. I've been working. I've been driving my car. I've been doing stuff everyone else does. I've been watching the rugby and drinking beer and I've been doing all this. And you think you have this thought, I've been living my life wrong. H imagine you go and tell now your family that you've been living your life wrong. They'd be like, "You need another car accident, man. You lost your mind." Well, I mean, what's wrong with the rugby and the beer? What's wrong with the way we living? You know, you come up there and say, "Yeah, I don't really think I should wear shorts. I don't think I should do this." Oh, you think you're holier than thou now? You think you're better than us. And immediately, what's happened? You're being conceived elsewhere. &gt;&gt; This other life is being reset. &gt;&gt; See, and it's fascinating. And so this GSC is taken over and you uh you you become obsessed with being different. I want to be different. I want to dress differently. I want to dress like these people. I want to act like these people. I want to praise like them. I want to feel like them. I want to experience the look at the joy they have reading their Bible. I only read Psalm 23 for all my life. Right? And you realize your life was all wrong. And this this this idea begins to possess you. I want to be different in new life. You think it's you but a new life is already taking place. Right? And it's making you search for God. Now remember you thought you were but it was God who found you found you. But now you start to search for him. Okay? And it's something inside. And you and you're not even born yet. You're still only conceived. You're still begotten. So what happens is you're just coming to the church. You're inside mother. Mother is the church, &gt;&gt; right? And our new nature is not even in its infancy. You're not even a baby yet. You're still a fetus. &gt;&gt; You've just been begotten. Right. And right now you are drawing on mom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You are drawing on the strength of the mother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And on any mother who's had a pregnancy is going to tell you that's an experience that affects the whole church. &gt;&gt; Any new believer, any new person who's baptized, any new person that comes in affects the whole body. &gt;&gt; Right? And your new nature being not even in its infancy, it's drawing strength from mother. Literally, when a baby's inside the mother's womb, it's drawing from the blood of the mother. That's what that umbilical cord is. It's drawing iron and calcium and nutrients. And when um when a mom finds out she's pregnant, the doctor says, "Okay, you're going on killer fur. You're going on what's that green stuff?" Uh anyway, it's supposed to be um uh I actually forget that name. Thank goodness. No more kids. Uh it's a stuff it's the the the the the major thing that that deals with development of the spine and the bones and that's the first thing they start popping you with. And then you you're taking calcium and iron and all this stuff and then why because this child is drawing from the mother and then you know the excuse I'm eating for two, right? Well, it's it's draw really drawing out from the mother's blood and the mother's body drawing it all out, right? We know they were eating for for two before they were pregnant, you know, but now they're eating for two legally. So our our so our nature is not even in its infancy. We are drawing strength from the spiritual mother. So that means a new child or a new conception in the church starts to affect it. So when you're here, everyone is walking eggshells around you. Careful with you. They're there. Some of them who even, you know, dress recklessly because they know you're a new person. Next couple of weeks they're tighten up, you know, be a little bit more legalistic. Just show them what it really is. just affects everybody, you know, and and we've got to be careful with them. Make sure the song leading, maybe this happens, maybe uh the way we pray, let's let's not overdo it a little bit. Just just make them comfortable. Let's uh let's deal with them. And then you'll see the the teachers in the church start to rally around them and start to, you know, do you have any questions and can we answer anything? Would you like to have coffee with us and invite you over? And then we bring you over to, you know, a social where we're having stuff together. It's like you're being uh uh carefully nurtured. &gt;&gt; They're dealing with you kindly. They're dealing with you because you're fragile. They're being really nice. This will happen in any church, right? And so, do you know how a pregnancy affects a mother? That little seed gum, just that little speck. I mean it's they'll literally even tell you when it's a walnut size and then when it's a when it when it's an orange size like in nine week in the first nine weeks of pregnancy it actually you the mother actually starts having dental pain because that's how much of calcium it's drawing out. At that time they're telling you're supposed to be having a lot of calcium because you can you can start damaging your your dental uh quality if from the ninth week. Right? The poor mother doesn't know why her joy is aching. In the meantime, this baby is drawing out this calcium. And this the seed germ brings all these kinds of emotions. Here's the other thing, right? You come home one day and she's just crying. Husband doesn't know why she's crying. Why you crying? I don't know, right? She doesn't even know why she's crying. It's this baby doing that. It's drawing. In other words, there even emotional changes. Then she's waking up through the night. She's having nightmares. The weirdest dreams possible. And in the third trimester, it's even worse. They start having these crazy dreams, right? You just got to And brothers, if you're ever coming there, do not say anything like, "Honey, it's just the hormones." Don't worry, it's just the hormones. Just hold them. Hold them and listen to the story. Even if you lose 2 hours sleep at night, just hold them and say, "It's okay. It's okay." Right? Because this this is what I'm saying to you. When you're a new believer, you cause all sorts of emotional upsets in the church. But this is a wonderful experience. It's a beautiful experience. If you ask the mother the next day, she she didn't even sleep all night. She made us lose sleep, too. But the next day, she's bustling with this energy. And then we're we're going and then we're we're painting the nursery four times. I speak from experience. First this color was the right color, then it was the wrong color, then it was this wrong shade, then we painted by the time of fourth on the fourth stage. And then she's like nice and round and you're the best husband. You like painted the nursery four times, right? That's what's going to happen. I mean, it's such a an enjoyable, difficult, emotional roller coaster ride experience is what it is to be having a person in the begotten stage in a church. It's like a you if you ever seen people in the message like really become weirdly excitable is when someone is baptized. They are like they could have been depressed the day before and someone is baptized and they're whooping and screaming. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Glory to God. We're so happy. There's another soul uh you knowh ready to go to heaven. They're just rejoicing. You know, we feel so good. Let's go have some special lunch, you know, just because somebody uh got baptized. This is what it's like. And so first with this creature inside the womb is this insatiable hunger cuz they want every question answered now like like you could like it's with someone brother can't you just download everything for me &gt;&gt; that that only happened in the last two decades &gt;&gt; when the word download came into existence prior to that we had to struggle with teaching you with paper and pen and diagrams and sit with You remember, brother Mark? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Going through 4 in the morning, we're all sitting together and drawing things out and questioning and arguing and oh, it was glorious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But nowadays, they want it downloaded. You know, can't you just some way can I just get the whole seventh seal in like 5 minutes? It'll do me so good. Sorry, brother. This is a begotten state. You got to go through this. &gt;&gt; See this and this hunger. Um, it brings a hunger for God. Brother speaks about this in thinking man's filter. So just your presence in a church brings a church into turmoil right and the presence of the gene seed in your soul sets your body into a turmoil. So remember you are uh conceived again and the church is being given an experience. You are having that experience with the church but also individually inside of you that gene seed is causing trouble for this body that you're living in. All right? Because both the church and this body is an incubator for the gene seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. A living incubator. So the same way the gene seed in you is causing your body to react differently to the world because imagine now you got this gene seed inside. You go back, you're living with the same worldly family you grew up with. Now you're changing your room around. You're kicking stuff out. You're changing your wardrobe around. Then eventually some of it, some of us had it so bad you get kicked out of the house. &gt;&gt; And you got to go find another place. That's how bad it is. Gets really, really difficult. And uh uh you people at work see you change. People at work see your dressing and think, "What happened?" Right? what's going on? And then of course there's the cravings. Now it's the the cravings of the mother will go straight to the father cuz the father has to buy the food, &gt;&gt; right? I'm feeling for this. I'm feeling for that. We don't know why we're feeling for that. But there's somebody new in church. And look, you'll find brother Allan bring the question. You know, brother Allah, I think you need to go through the seals again. I think you need to go through the church ages again. I don't know why he knows why he's asking me this. or why he's telling me. But that's that's just it. There's this people in the church who are sensing something, feeling something. They come up with a question and then it's drawing something out from the ministry and we're answering that. What are we doing? Dealing with cravings just because of you, right? And emotional distress, bodily upset. One of the biggest things for a mother is bodily upset. Why? It literally is changing her body. It's causing her to swell. It's causing it to move differently. The church starts to slow down because someone is begotten. Well, we were moving at a speed before. Now we got to slow down. Even in the preaching, sometimes I I'm so much aware of it. If there's a new person in the church, and when I say new person, I mean even somebody who's been here like 5 years, I'm going to have to say things in a way that everyone understands it, including them. &gt;&gt; Which means I'm going to have to break it down to the simplest kind of form. And I'm conscious of that, right? Because you're dealing with someone who is begotten. And and we know they haven't reached there yet. They haven't come to their new birth yet. Labor pains just before the birth. Of course, the bodily pains and then just before the birth itself, there is labor pains. labor pains. If I had to put that to you spiritually, that's going to be the part where your life is turned upside down, right? You come to this message, something's going to happen, things are going to happen with you personally. I cannot describe it. I cannot even give you a a scenario that works for everyone because it's different for everyone. The new birth is different for everyone, right? But all we know is you're there's going to be labor pains to bring you out to be the person to be born. There's going to be labor pains, right? So you've got all this uh then is your period. This this this labor pains you you're going through justification. You're going through sanctification. You still have no revelation of who God really is. You're still struggling a little bit to understand the Godhead. So he's kind of making sense. you know these you still got questions you're hearing questions from your family from your work colleagues because you trying to share this with them something you don't know anything about or barely know everything about yet and then you come to me and you ask me and I say to you well I know I don't know everything about it either you know and then oh well you look at me kind of like okay then you go back and answering question from family and friends and you you're excited you you think you got this great thing you go and share it with someone and they totally slam you and tell them I don't want to see you again. You were in with this cult people, right? And um you have you're learning the stuff in this in this message, but you still have no revelation of who God really is yet, right? And you don't even know who you are yet. I think of it that little baby in the womb. It doesn't even know its name. It doesn't know its mom and dad. It doesn't know its family. It doesn't know whether it has siblings. It hasn't seen its house yet. It hasn't even seen that nursery that's been painted four times. Right? You are learning all the basics of what you should be like from everything around you. Right? So uh and and and all that's around you is just this incubator, this really comfortable place that you were living in and you're hearing these sounds and these beautiful sounds and mother is protecting you and you know you're just being pampered but you're in an incubator, right? And still the seed is not air, right? With the shock, there's something else happening. You are learning all the basics of what you should be like with everything around you. And this is why things can go so wrong when something goes wrong in the church and in your body. In other words, at that time, you're a begotten Christian and the church goes through a split or a fight or something happens and you're just a new believer. You're just begotten and it's like turmoil. What's what's going on right now? I thought these people were these, you know, beautiful perfect people, &gt;&gt; right? also in yourself. You just you had this accident. You ever go through the whole thing again? You got to the hospital. You someone gave you a book. You met these people. They brought you to your church. And then later down the line, they're telling you, you know what? There was a fracture in your back. We missed that. Now you got And now you're thinking, "Lord, I came to you. I I accepted this message. Now I've got this news. This is what I'm talking about." &gt;&gt; Right? these things things go wrong and something goes wrong in your body and the gene seed is still going to use whatever experience to bring the reset. &gt;&gt; You have to be re-educated. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the here's the problem. Every revival brings forth &gt;&gt; twins. &gt;&gt; So, remember at the church the church at this stage is bringing forth twins. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there are those who are begotten of the right seed and those who are begotten of the wrong seed also around you sometimes &gt;&gt; and you're drawing from the same ministry and enjoying the same warmth of the same womb, the same church that so means you might even come into a message church and you're meeting all the people and you're just meeting some other people &gt;&gt; that are also in there but they're just waiting to flock around you and give do something wrong or make you or speak against somebody else to you or or tell you something that it that you can see why is this person discouraging me? What's going on here? You know why? Why are they even telling me this? You know, like be careful of this. You know, in this church there are these clicks. That group gets along that group, that one, you know, you could stick with me. This is what you get in churches, right? And so there's always twins. So also when you apply that to your own life, you have the days when the the chosen one is jubilant and exciting and rejoicing and is loving the word and the other one is the other twin. &gt;&gt; Remember that other twin was born before you. &gt;&gt; He is the older one. He is always dominating. He's always the one who's going to say, "You know what? Next week I don't really want to go to church. I want to go to my old church. I'm going to look at something else, you know. I I want to uh experience something different. Maybe let's just go back to the rugby and have a beer and see how that works out, you know, like my old life. The older twin is always going to be pushing back. So, this is another part of the conception process. &gt;&gt; You're not going to be away from that experience. There is always going to be the other twin there, right? And so same womb, different seed, same atmosphere, same religion if you want to put it that way. And in so in you a nature, another nature is is moving alongside you. Okay? And then we are born. Okay? Now this is the part where you are coming out from the mother's womb. Okay. But even in the born again experience, this is what I want to bring you to. You are still connected to mother, right? Because as a baby, you're an infant. You are still depending on the church. Are you with us? Let's read question and answers part three. Paragraph 276. Paragraph page 1121. the the man had followed him for three three years and had a name on the lamb's book of life and cast out devils and done great works talking about Peter and healed and preached the word and everything that's and still wasn't converted. &gt;&gt; You're leading to conversion. You see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You could have gone around preaching the word, doing great works, being a part of the evangelical services, casting out devils, and you're still not born. &gt;&gt; You're still begotten. 277. You see, that's what I mean. You could have been part of that. You could have been hearing the message in Durban for like 40 years. You could be like being a part of every evangelical move. You could be preaching the word. You could have you could have testimonies of casting out devils, praying for the sick, the sick being healed, and you're still only begotten. &gt;&gt; You're not even born yet. Amen. Well, the man says that and he's referring to Peter when the par 277 when the act was has taken place between the egg and the sperm or the gene. Uh but when the potentially the baby's there when the act is done then the body is developed second stage but the baby has to be born here then receives the breath of life. It's not yet the breath of life. You say oh it's alive. No it isn't. There's little nerves jerking muscles. The baby hasn't received life till it's born. And you may jump and jerk, but you're not. You got to be born. You know what I mean? All right. I got to stop there and just put this in cuz in this world today, there's this whole argument with abortion where they say uh it's not alive. That's an academic reasoning to say that it's not alive. And now you we'll read in the message. Brother man says, "No, it's not alive until it gets a breath of life." You see? No, you see nothing. &gt;&gt; That's still wrong. &gt;&gt; Okay. Of course, it has life in it, which comes from the spark of life. You can hear him say this in other places in the message. When the two come together, egg and sperm come together, the spark of life that comes in there. But when you become manifesting, manifesting is having the breath of life mean becoming your own person. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. That's when you are truly living. He doesn't mean you're dead. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't say something so silly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Of course, you're not dead in your mother's womb. You are alive. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But you're not living. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There it is. You are alive but you're not living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you're alive and you're cocoon. You're incubated. You're not manifesting yourself. &gt;&gt; You have no identity. You don't know anybody. You don't know mom. You don't know dad. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, brother is saying you still got to be born. Okay. So, when a baby is born now, the baby comes out of mom. There he is in that little swaddling cloth and there he's born. Now he's seeing mom for the first time. This is where he starts to identify. A lot of things start to happen. When you are born again of the spirit, right? And this is receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost, being baptized into one body. This is when you actually become a part of the body. &gt;&gt; You start to recognize the identity of mom. &gt;&gt; Yes. You start to see the purpose of the church. You start realizing a lot of things. Your first identity you are getting is the identity of mom. And the identity of mom is going to stay with you for a very long time. That's what it means. By one spirit are we all baptized into one body. That's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost does to you. It inducts you into the body. Right? And you are only truly born again when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost for your day. Right? So when the new conception has taken place in you, your re-education starts and it starts living in you. But when you are born again, right? That's when you recognize the identity of the church. Why? The Holy Ghost gives you power to live what you have just believed. Prior to that, you were just a parasite drawing off mama. &gt;&gt; But now when you are born, you receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost is being given the power to live what you've believed. You started believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you were not living yet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now you can start living and you are not directly affected by the emotions of the church anymore. Right? &gt;&gt; So you're not connected by umbilical cord to mom anymore. You're now your own individual and the church is around you and you are associating yourself. You are getting this feeling of togetherness with everyone. Right? And yet not directly connected to the emotions and motions of the church. The church has become a second parent to you now. First it was the only parent. Now it's become a second parent because you're starting to see this other guy. This guy you never got used to before. You're starting to see this dad fell. He's always hanging around. &gt;&gt; Right. You start to recognize there's somebody beyond the church. There's another parent. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And now you want to get to know that one. But you're still bound to mama. That's still the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So the church has become the second parent and the church is this tutor. So you know, you go out and you make a little mistake and they come back. Hey, come here. Come here. That's not really how we do things here. You know, this is this is how it works. And that's mama correcting you. That's the church, you know, bringing you to you're you're under tutors and governors. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And the problem is people think when you got saved that was right people think that's when you got saved that that was just begotten right they don't know in this time you are born when the Holy Ghost does something to you that is relevant for your day. So the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are receiving for your day is God giving you something. You are being born. You are being given a purpose, some identity with the church. You are identifying yourself with the identity of the church that is your mother. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; For example, it'll be totally crazy for you to be here in this church and say, "Well, I want to follow the Catholic purpose." That's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; That's just silly. Yes. &gt;&gt; So in other words, when the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes upon you, it's going to give you the purpose of this body. &gt;&gt; You are going to be unified with the purpose of the body. You don't even have your own purpose yet. You've got the purpose of the body. And the purpose of the body is going to be multiffold, right? The word, the worship, the uh dealing with helping with people, all kinds of different things. You're going to be part of the purpose of mother. Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; You are born again today by the opening of the seventh seal to you personally today. Your new birth comes from what happened under the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Your new birth today is not the same as a Pentecostal new birth. It's not the same as a Methodist new birth or some other kind of new birth. Your new birth today, you only come into the purpose of the the true bright church when the seventh seal opens to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Prior to that, you were just begotten. Try it. Test your life and tell me. You were living under the guise of a born again experience according to Pentecostals. Right. &gt;&gt; But you know when the open book opened up to you, you know what happened then? Prior to that, you were just living cocooned. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; When that opened up, that's when you start recognizing where your purpose is. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to paragraph 116 or page 1165, paragraph 57. Notice a mother. She can be ever so mean and cruel. Just before the baby's born, there's a sweet, a certain kindness that sets in. Do you ever notice a mother when she's to be a mother, that means when she's about to give birth, something sweet about her. She always takes on that real sweetness. That little angel spirit, a little messenger to this little tabernacle is ready to come forth into the world. And then when this little angel comes into the body, that's a little angel of the earth, the baby, a spirit that's ordained of God to take this body. Then that baby has to have a choice. It makes it decision. this then then when this takes place when you see the angel of the lord now comes in which is a spiritual body that's eternal uh parable 58 this is a dying spirit in a dying body but now you can't be in two bodies at one time but there can be two natures in you at one time now the nature of the spirit the lord when you're born again you're not born of physical like the baby was but what's happened the spiritual birth has come to you and while the spiritual birth is growing into your heart of God. There's a physical or celestial body growing to receive that spirit. When the life leaves this body, it goes to that body. Just as when the body is presented to the earth, that spirit comes in. When a spirit goes out of the body, there's a body waiting for we. So that's what we read in 1 Peter 3 &gt;&gt; 1:3, right? For this body will be dissolved and will take on the other one. &gt;&gt; So how do you know when you are born again? How do you know when you are born again? Because this is the confusion people are having now. It's not when the word starts making sense to you cuz the word started making sense to you a long time ago. Depending on how people broke it down to you, a lot of things will make sense and then other things don't make sense. &gt;&gt; This is a perfectly supernatural experience. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Amen. &gt;&gt; When the word starts revealing itself, when it's becoming revelation, &gt;&gt; you are quickened to revelation &gt;&gt; because upon this rock I'll build my church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not upon this education, not upon this making sense. &gt;&gt; Upon this revelation rock, I'll build my church. So the new birth takes place when you start to receive revelation. &gt;&gt; Now take it back to the baby. What revelation does a baby have in the womb? Nothing. &gt;&gt; What revelation does a baby have when it's born? It's still can't speak. It doesn't it's seeing mother. it. At that moment when a baby is looking at its mother, there's no neurons connecting saying, "Hey, you're the one whose stomach I was inside." You know, you look nice or you don't look so good. You know, the baby doesn't have any of those thoughts. Just smiling stupidly. Ah, feed me. That's all. Right. It still doesn't know anything. He's got no identity. And that's the thing about when you're receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you are quickened into something. You don't even know anything. You just have a revelation. Revelation. Something inside the baby is telling this this child, I'm connected to you. &gt;&gt; You and me, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I can't prove it. I don't never read any quotes. I don't know anything but you and me. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're together. &gt;&gt; That's the thing. And upon this rock, what did what did Peter say to Christ? That was the Christ, the son of the living God. Flesh and blood had not revealed us to you. You know, and that's the thing about mothers and parents and babies. I don't know how babies can have anything make sense because the parents don't even speak English to them. What kind of revelation or sense can a child make when you talk like that to the child? H everything goes bad from there. You call them all, you name them, you know, some really fancy name with their grandparents and whatever and then you call them like Pooky for 10 years, you know, Nunie, Marshmallow, Munchkin. And I'm walking around like, why do we bother naming this child? You know, if you're going to name, how is this child going to have any identity or revelation when you keep calling him something that is not even his name? I feel sorry for babies. You know, like what kind of revelation are they supposed to have when they're not even being spoken to in English? You laugh. That happens in churches. &gt;&gt; You got these new people coming to these churches and these ministers are thrashing out stuff they don't even understand. Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Just nonsense. Just buzzwords. Just fancy words to make mom and dad look really caring or something. But they're not getting anything. They're just enjoying this whole hype. I always think from the from the eyes of a child. The child is lying there and we're we're standing there over them acting really goofy and stupid. And this child is just smiling. And the more the child smiles, the more we put on a show. I feel like such a crazy person doing that, you know. But sometimes they just draw it out of you. And so how do you know when you are born again? That is when the word starts revealing itself to and you are quickened to it. Right? What is the evidence of the Holy Ghost? Right? Once you are born again, you are his. Right. So 1 John 3:9 says, "Whoever is born born of God does not commit sin, for his seed remainth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God." So at this point, at this point, when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you are no longer going to disbelieve. You cannot disbelieve God's word. Right? There are no when you are truly I'm not talking about someone who just receives some kind of anointing right you there are no doubts about him you like you don't you can't explain anything but you know mom you know dad revelation is from the very beginning revelation is the key are you with me so remember your older twin has also received the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; anointing but has the wrong seat your twin has also been born but But the seal is not upon him. He has no representation. Has not been connected to a theophony. Has no heavenly body waiting to receive him. He does not know this. And he thinks he's very much like you and a part of you. We know that someday he's going to leave. Right? But he is the one that is able to sin. Now I'm talking to you personally inside you. The gene seed can never sin. &gt;&gt; He is born of God. &gt;&gt; But this thing still has attributes of unbelief in it. &gt;&gt; This older twin is still going to do wrong stuff even though you've been born again. Are you with me? that this is the trouble that I don't know modern or I would say current message people are struggling to come to terms with like since I preach on the Holy Ghost in North America I'm getting questions like you know what isn't the Holy Ghost supposed to take away all this stuff are we not supposed like the last service we did are we still going to be doing bad things and I'd explain that you know and it's like I thought the Holy Ghost takes away even the feeling of this and takes away God does. No, it doesn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are still going to go through stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. He uh so what you need to understand like Paul says when I want to do good evil is present. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he says who can save me from the body of this death? I don't want to go through all that again. But that's the other twin. That's the old nature you were born with. And the whole point of being reborn is so that this this new birth can come to a growth and a stage and immaturity where it can dominate the other one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So you say but I make such terrible mistakes within yourself. It is your old nature under the effects of the Holy Ghost thinks that it is part of the promise. It's your flesh that feels it has something. So when you get that beautiful feeling of being born again, you know who benefits first? The older twin. &gt;&gt; He's the one who feels the excitement. He is the one who wants to duplicate the excitement. He's the one who wants to tell you we need to have this experience forever and forever and forever. He's the one who's who's going to be trying to interpret things. But the other one just knows I know who my father is. &gt;&gt; That's all I know right now. I can't explain everything, but I know who my father is. Amen. And that's the only thing that's going to hold you. It's so that older twin, its end is going to be the rapture. Why? We know this body will be dissolved. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there's a new one waiting for us. So that older twin will come to its end in the rapture. The body is dissolved. The old nature is put away. Your new nature within you which has been born. It is no longer just a seed, an attribute like it was inside mama. But now it's living. Now it's manifesting. Now it's dealing with challenges. It's learning to walk. It's it's crawling. It's walking. It's standing. It's falling. It's it's growing. Right? It's now living. It's it's in you. It's it's an infant form. It's a baby. Notice your old nature being the old twin will always get its way most of the time after you were born again. Your old nature is still going to get its way most of the time because you're still not grown up yet. You just been born again. What do you expect? And that's the other thing when you know uh this is a very human thing. Somebody has an experience uh you know they come to church they have this full-blown experience in the presence of the Lord it's a real genuine repentance birthing messy they have this experience they come forward they have prayer and then a few weeks later you know it's like human pe humans once you once they see you had the experience they expect you to be 100% &gt;&gt; like from from there on now the person makes a mistake and you say And there's people talking and saying, "You see that experience?" And and it's like when you tell a child, I thought you said you had this experience. Now look what you did. Like what do you mean? Can I not make a mistake? Can I not have a bad day? Of course you can. You can have that experience in the presence of the Lord. You can feel born again. You can feel um that revelation come down on you and still you can make a mistake. still you can have a bad day. That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's why it's the older one, not you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. You have to come to that personal understanding. I'm not going to be here to make you feel good. Say, "Don't worry, brother. It's not you." Yes, you still have to account for it because your body did it, right? You're going to have to account for it, but you've got to know who your father is. That revelation is the only one that can hold you during every trial of backslideness. Is there scripture? Well, of course there is. What was the only thing that prodigal son who wasted all his ex all his existence all his inheritance sitting among the pigs? What is the one thing he said? I have a father. Nothing else could redeem him at that point. &gt;&gt; I have a father. &gt;&gt; That's the only revelation that holds you in a new birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the only time you're getting identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what identity, that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is about. It's supposed to bring to you identity. Identity of mom, identity of dad, and it's drawing you towards your own identity. You still don't know who you are yet. This guy's sitting in a pig pen sitting among all the filth. All he knows is I have a father. He still doesn't know who he is yet. He's called a prodigal son. Now he's got to go and take his place. When he goes back to the father, when he comes back to the father, that's when the father says, "Put on him my robe. Put on him my ring. kill the fatted calf. Now the father is giving him his identity. That's where we come to conversion. Can you see? Up to this point, you thought you were converted. Why? Just cuz you you you you done well at dressing weirdly, huh? You thought you were converted. Just because you came to a message church, you sing different songs. You thought you were converted. No, you were probably just begotten and then you were born again and you're still not converted. Let's read Acts chapter 3. Let's go to converted. I think I put a nice picture there for converted. Hey, think about that a little while. But what converted is prior to that was everyone else helping you. Acts 3:1 19 Repent you therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord. Now you Bible readers with the spirit of wisdom and revelation I'm calling on you. The process of conversion takes place after the birth. You thought you were converted when you came to the church when you chose the message. &gt;&gt; I want to point out here that this is the only stage the scripture indicates blotting out of sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be converted that your sins be blotted out. You want your sins blotted out when you're begotten. You want your sins blotted out when you're born again. You're your sins are only blotted out when you're converted. Glory to God &gt;&gt; in the conversion stage. Why? How is that so? See, that's the thing. That's why I said when I preached the other week, it's like, brother Al, the the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I need the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I can get rid of these bad things. I'm sorry. That's not how it works. Trust me, you just get rid of those bad things and there's more bad things coming up. &gt;&gt; You know what? You thought you were bad. You just didn't realize how bad you were. Except a whole lot of things from your family genes still inside waiting to pop out. And the only thing that can expose those things is the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, just when you thought I gave up drinking, I gave up smoking. And you know what? You didn't realize you could be a thief, a cheat, a liar. Those things were still stuck inside. They still have to come out. They still have to be exposed. A backbiter, a gossip. Nothing better than putting you in a church to prove you're a gossip. Uh, someone who could kill your brother's testimony. You never thought you could do that. A murderer. Huh? And all you thought was, "I was a smoker. Praise the Lord. I got deliverance the day I got baptized and I was born again." Yeah. So funny. You're still learning how bad it actually was. How bad those sinful natures are. It's going to be drawn out of you. It's going to be exposed. Why? You You have to be rewritten. You have to be converted. Amen. Now, here's the other question. Where is it blotted out? Where are your sins blotted out from? I'm I'm so glad we spoke about it on Wednesday. You know, like I was telling you, God doesn't have give himself a memory wipe, you know, &gt;&gt; where he he forgets everything. Just wipes it out. Oh, look at my son. I totally forgot what he did last week. All those bad things. No. What? What bad things? I can't remember. It's in the sea of my forgetfulness. I'm the kind of God that can just forget things. &gt;&gt; No, it's not blotting it out from his mind. It's blotting it out from your mind. &gt;&gt; Nothing. Not begotten. Not baptism of the Holy Ghost is going to blot it out from your life and your mind. Only conversion &gt;&gt; does that. Conversion blotss it up. So be converted that your sins be blotted out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, think of it carefully. If you are a changed new person, what happens when you are a changed person? You make new memories. You make new experiences for you and for people. So put it this way. You done wrong things. You were a sinner. You were an awful person. Whatever. You came into the message church. You had a Holy Ghost experience. And still people don't know what you can do. The only thing they know is what you did. It's still not blotted out. All they're doing is, "Oh yes, we you know this brother, he used to be this and this, but God has saved him." That's all they know. You're still nothing. &gt;&gt; You're still the person who has their testimony. Do you have a new testimony? No. So the only way the Old Testament gets blotted out is if there's a New Testament. &gt;&gt; The New Testament blotss out the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So it then has to be what you do, your identity that blotss out your sin. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is a problem with church. And to me, message churches have this problem. &gt;&gt; This is the problem. You go all around the world today. This is a message problem. &gt;&gt; What is it? Sitting around and doing nothing. &gt;&gt; Come to church, listen to the pastor, go back home and do nothing else. No other identity. What do you do? Who are you besides a message church goer? Who are you? How do we come to the end of our lives and stand next to Paul who traveled to three cities a day to preach and say, "We're brothers. We did good for the kingdom of God. You toiled. You labored. You went on horseback and camel. You got thrown in prison. Me I sat at home and read the books. I came to church. I listened to brother Al. I made sure I amen him. I was his amen corner. &gt;&gt; That is what I did for the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Oh, I came to church. I grew up my children. I put them to school. I taught them good values. That's my purpose. This is a message church problem. This is stagnation. This is why you end up with people who are confused about their experience. This is why you you you you end up with people who don't know and then when when time goes by and you're sitting around doing nothing with yourself. Um you don't know what to do. So there's no identity. Well, no wonder people are never forgetting the wrong things you did because you're not doing any new things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're in this conversion stage and it's about to get real. [Music] Right now, it's about to get real. You know what's happening? We've been sitting around. God has been throwing war here, war there, economic stress, famine here, flood here, earthquake there, volcano there, tsunami there. All those things happening. And we're still sitting, waiting. Because this message mindset is we must just read the message, listen to tapes, come to church, and wait for the rapture. You're a whole bunch of people who have been begotten and born and no conversion. [Music] &gt;&gt; Everything is about me, me, me, help me. Let me draw. The the experience is when the church doesn't help me. What are you doing? You're still a baby. When the church doesn't do when they don't call me, when they don't visit me, you're already telling me you're a child. &gt;&gt; You're a child. This is when your new nature starts dominating the old. The conversion state, the process of conversion is when you start taking responsibility for your life and say the gene seed in me is strong. Now I am controlling that other guy. We reach level ground. Now I'm growing. the word, the mysteries are being revealed and I'm growing. Now, I'm not I know it was it was harsh a few minutes ago. I would say that it was meant to be that way for a while because this was the only stage where the mysteries could be revealed, right? And we had to wait for the mysteries to be revealed. Unfortunately, we got stuck in this place of waiting. Now that the mysteries are being revealed, there needs to be your identity coming in. We know father's identity. We know mother's identity, right? And mother's a true mother, a true father is going to start kicking you out the nest. &gt;&gt; This is the thing. This idea of churches pampering people, I can't stand it. &gt;&gt; That's like you want to keep them babies. You want to keep them loyal. &gt;&gt; You have no idea how bad it is. You know I some things I don't even think about like you know what hear some brothers say no no no you must take up the offerings after the preaching of the word because that's what all the people I hear. If you take it during the song service some people and some people only come after the offering has been taken. I I never think like that. And then I think what? Why would you even think like that? And then I didn't realize they even make these rules. If you love God, you'll be there half an hour before the service and you have quiet time before. What is all that for? Make sure you've got full church before the the offering is taken. &gt;&gt; It's unbelievable. And you want to keep your babies, you know, keep you there, keep you supporting them. That's a mother who can't let go. That's a problem. A mother who can't let go is a problem because a child is not getting his own identity. &gt;&gt; And that's why a father has to step in and say, "Listen, let him go bang his head. Let him go make his mistake. Yeah, he'll come back. Oh, mama, this what she'll." But with me, go do it. It's your choice. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you've got to learn from it. &gt;&gt; I've got to give you your own identity. You've got to know how to deal with it your way by my advice. See, and this is the problem. This is what I find the issue right now when I say there's a shift in the message. We've really have to shift people from this place of babbing them. We've got to put the power in their hands. We've got to respect their free will. That's right. &gt;&gt; We've got to realize we've got to even let our people go into serious trouble where they messed their lives up and respect their free will choice and know that if they are God's child, they'll come back. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You can't control them. You can't keep them as a baby crawling baby forever. The first sign of the biggest enemy, they will die &gt;&gt; cuz they got no experience. This is the problem with teenagers in the message today. What do we do? Keep them as babies, right? Look at what they did with the courtship and dating. You brought up with all these message youth, you know, who just stand outside church and don't talk. Nobody's allowed to approach you. Nobody flirts with you. They come to you. They stand, you talk, the brother stands, the sister comes. God bless you, sister. The teenager, 16, 17. God bless you, sister. You know, and quotes the message. Look at me. I'm not mocking this. I'm telling you what's going to happen. &gt;&gt; Then this child goes to university and meets a beautiful girl dressed like the world. She's not going to stand there and, you know, uh, come and ask him about the message. Those girls out in the in university will just kiss you for fun. like you'll never even see it coming. You'll be sitting in a cafeteria uh doing your work and someone wouldn't come and sit on your lap. This is not message kids. Now you're at school, you're meeting a and you don't know how to deal with it because in your own home you are never even allowed to deal with it. They made you act like it's sinful like it's like so the the youth couldn't even talk to each other on the basis of being normal boys and girls to be flirted with to deal with flirting to deal with rejection. You know what happens to our message boys the first time they are rejected by a girl they act like the biggest babies you've ever seen on the planet. Life is over. They're dead. They're ready for death because it's the first time they've been rejected. These are the guys supposed to go in the rapture. These are the guys who supposed to be standing with Samson and David. One girl rejects him and they can't even hold a sword. You're depressed. You're broken. You're ready to give up on God. You're ready to end everything just cuz a girl rejected you. You haven't been rejected enough. That's your problem. Mommy's been treating you like you're the the be the next best thing to God. &gt;&gt; Mommy's been treating you're a gold. You're a jewel in the crown. You're saved. You got the Holy Ghost. You're perfect. You're my You got the best hairstyle. You're the brightest kid on the block. Rejected one time and you're done for. That's what we're getting right now. Young girls, you grew up in this cocoon with this message uh community. Perfect, right? You you you're brought up with all these gentlemanly figures in the church. Sister so and so. Sister so and so. You get out there to all those fellas who come up there with their pickup lines and their cars and their gel back hair and their uh watchers and their whatever they have to give you and you you're sunk. &gt;&gt; First smooth talking coyote and you're gone. You're sunk. You got not not enough Holy Ghost to give you common sense. You're done for. &gt;&gt; Why? Because parenting. This is a message thing. I look at people out there in the world. Some of them go through like three or four girlfriends. Eventually they've been wrecked. Then they go choose someone and of course they get married and they make a life together. They become successful. Yes. They fight, they drink, they do all the stuff that normal people do and they but they'll make their life or educate their kids or go to school. They'll have fake holidays on Facebook. Yeah. So what they do all that, right? And uh but they'll actually get their life together. No. message. People who've never been used to rejection, who never been used to to making their own decisions cannot survive when they're arguing with husband and wife. Like life is over. They cannot survive. Life can't function. They can't go to work. They can't even deal with an argument. They can't deal with conflict. &gt;&gt; You're fighting with a family, normal family arguments and feuds. You just can't deal with it. It's so pathetic. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the whole world goes through it. But you're acting like you're collapsing on the floor like jelly and custard. &gt;&gt; It is so annoying. Oh, tell you just counsel people long enough and I tell you you you're ready to leave the room because you're asking yourself, have I been preaching so long on the mysteries of the kingdom only to have this &gt;&gt; h? And don't let me get started with ministers. &gt;&gt; Ministers are the worst who cannot forgive one another. If you can't forgive another minister, how are you teaching your church to forgive each other? If if you can't be a brother to someone who hates you, how can you teach your child to do that? You're a hypocrite. If you if if you choose to have circles of ministers you agree with, people you get together with, people you have camps with, people you associate with, and you can't even associate with everybody like the prophet did. It's hypocrisy. It's immaturity. You haven't even come to conversion yet. You might just have been born. Listen, this is real. This is real experience. This is what's going on right now. So it is time for conversion for the the younger to be dominating the elder. And the elder should be serving the younger. We shouldn't be giving way for the elder to dominate. Think about it. You were once a person being ruled by the thinking of the world, the old nature, but now you're becoming a person guided by the thinking of the new nature. Let's read Romans 9 11. For the children being not born, neither having done any good or evil, the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth. It was said unto her, "The elder shall serve the younger." As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. &gt;&gt; See, the elder shall serve the younger. That's the prophecy. This is that that prophecy exists &gt;&gt; to tell us that there must come a time where this old nature &gt;&gt; must succumb to the new nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That new n there must be a conversion. &gt;&gt; That is the rest of your journey. Conversion is about the old nature serving the new nature, the elder serving the younger, the flesh to serve the purpose of the soul. It's the rest of your journey. You don't stop at being born again. But in modern Christianity, conversion is seen as just becoming a Christian. Converting from a sinner to a Christian. That is a changing that is changing religion. You can change a religion. It doesn't mean you're converted. &gt;&gt; It's not conversion. Let's read Israel and the church. Let's let's go through this quick. And he received the purpose before he was circumcised. Romans 4 will tell you. He received the promise before he was circumcised. Then he uh this is part of 11:18. Then he was given circumcision as a seal of his obedience of faith. Uh now when we say that why Billy Graham, Charles Philip, Billings and all of them why they're talking about them Baptist brethren I told you many of them Rufus Mosley and the whole bunch. He said well we have 20,000 converts in two weeks. They couldn't find 20 people. &gt;&gt; I said well they wasn't converted. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, he said they accepted Christ as personal savior. I said still they're not converted. &gt;&gt; You're converted. To convert means to be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 121 Peter had believed on the Lord. He had been baptized, been given power to heal the sick, cast out devils, raised the dead. Jesus told him the night before the crucifixion, after you're converted, strengthen your brother. &gt;&gt; Been both saved, sanctified, and hadn't been converted. Notice saved, sanctified, and not converted. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's go to approach to God. So what is converted? When God come down hunting for the man, there it is. See, God come down hunting for you. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice this. It's always God hunting the man, not man hunting God. See, I told you &gt;&gt; he said that. &gt;&gt; Did you ever think of that? that no man at any time or any age ever did within himself desired to serve God. Never has been. His nature's against it. That feeling you had of you hunting God was because God found you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he might have had some kind of an intellectual thoughts. He thinks that he does believe God. But when he actually really believes God, he becomes converted a new creature. As soon as he believes God, that means you can be begotten. And I just proved to you, you are begotten and you don't know mom and dad. You still don't believe God. Yet you know about the message. You know about William Brandon. You know about the message church. You're in the message church. You still don't believe God. You maybe you came under message parish. This is my my experience. born in a pastor's house, living the life, playing the music, baptized, and still don't know God. When you really believe God, becomes converted, a new creature. As soon as he believes God, he may be intellectually believing God. But when he believes from his heart, then he is converted. Becomes a member of the body of Christ. When he's converted from his heart, not from his intellects. Amen. We spoke about sanctification. We told you it was not revelation. You don't need revelation to be sanctified. You just need to stop doing the bad things and start doing good things. &gt;&gt; That's sanctifying yourself. Right? In justification and sanctification, you are still concerned with self. &gt;&gt; Begotten and born. You're still concerned with self. What mommy can do for me? What the church can do for me. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; What daddy can do for me? &gt;&gt; God help me. Pray for me. Pray for me. Lay hands on me. Help me with this. Help me with that. &gt;&gt; Those first two stages is what someone else can do for you. You are still concerned with self. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; What is conversion? After you are converted, strengthen your brethren. &gt;&gt; Thirsting for life. Did you ever read such words? How my soul long for thee in a thirsty land where no water is. This is rather an unusual text. But God is unusual. God does unusual things. He works in mysterious ways. He's wonders to perform. And we're living in an unusual day in an unusual time. But we're serving the God has been in all times. And when I thought of this, you know, my soul does for thee. If your soul is what directs you, it's what makes you what you are. A soul is the nature of the spirit. And when a man is converted, he doesn't get another spirit. He gets a spirit change. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; A conversion means to change his thinking. &gt;&gt; Change his way of living and so forth. So my souls, this is what I tell you. You can be a messed child. You can grow up in the word. You can live perfectly just like I did. Don't go make mistakes. Don't drink. Don't smoke. Don't fornicate. Don't do anything. Just live in the church. Right? And then you get to university and you come back and you start questioning God. You start questioning the Bible, questioning the message. You have questions on politics and abortion and LGBTQ and all this stuff. All it's telling me is you haven't been converted yet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You've been thinking about it. You've been intellectually believe. But when you believe God, there is a rock inside. No matter what this world gives you, there's my rock. &gt;&gt; That's what I believe. I may not be able to explain everything, but that's what I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's when you have started to be converted. Come to that stage and everything else falls away. You no longer have this thing about what you can do for me, what the church can do for me. You'll be brother Al. What can I do for for the church? What can I do for the brothers? What can I do for this situation? That's a person who's been converted and truly converted. Because anybody who has some kind of OCD will be asking, "What can I do? That doesn't mean you're converted. Unfailing realities of the living God. Some of them in the OCD just don't even ask. They just do. You know, that's not straight. That's not in place. Church should be this way. Shouldn't be that way. Nobody asked you. Just leave me as is. You know, I'm okay with that. But it gets to the place where you start getting revelation. You get an identity and the identity when God reveals to you what your strength is and your purpose is for the body. That's when you start strengthening your brethren. Amen. Unfailing reality to the living God. The Holy Spirit comes today in a manner like to to present I love this. The Holy Spirit comes today in like manner to present God to man. If there's anything that should be the evidence of the Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; is God being presented to me. &gt;&gt; But man wants to go to church. See that? Those fellas still want to live with their mommy. Not too many amens. That's okay. You have to let go. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you have to realize you have a purpose outside of mommy, &gt;&gt; outside of the church. You'll always have the church to run back to so it can soo you when you're crying. But you know, you have to have a purpose beyond parents. That's where we are coming to. We must learn that God is not known by intellectual conception. I'm reading God is known by the new birth, by the Holy Ghost, not by other way. Jesus. The Bible is plainly quoted. No man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost. And if you So it means you only get connected to father when you receive the Holy Ghost. That's when you start. You can be born born and you see mommy. But when is the time when you recognize daddy as daddy? You got to receive his spirit, his anointing. He's got to spend time with you. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you got to spend time with him. You know, uh most of the time you just any mother and father ju you you just have a new baby and uh the baby immediately bonds with mommy and uh baby doesn't know anything about what you're doing and most of the time she's feeding the baby and you come there and you try to pick up baby and the baby cries. It doesn't even know you. That's why &gt;&gt; who are you? Go away. You know, and then and when it's feeding time or sleep time, they treat you like dirt. You're the father. You've been slogging all day. You've been helping wipe nappies and you've been going getting the food. Mom is just taking care of Oh, she's cooing with you, bing with you, enjoying your new play. And she and you're bonding with her. Poor fellow comes back from work sweating and whatever. And the baby just doesn't want to know you. That's fine. I told my wife, I said, "You got them until they're teenagers. After that, they're mine. I'm okay. I'm not insecure. I don't need them to love me when they're babies. But when they're teenagers, I'm going to whoop them into shape. That's for sure." If you never receive the Holy Ghost, you don't know that he is Christ. You cannot know his identity. You cannot know father unless you receive the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Glory. So what is the Holy Ghost for? It's presenting God to man. It's giving you identity of who your father is. You're going to start learning who he is. But that's not the end. The end is knowing who you are. &gt;&gt; Even if you know father, you're not converted. You're not converted until you receive the Holy Ghost. The Bible said after Peter had been saved and sanctified and given power. So you have to receive the Holy Ghost and when the Holy Ghost comes because father's identity gives you your identity. &gt;&gt; See and Peter so do you understand? Huh? Not completely. See this is the problem with message churches because you develop develop a message church identity &gt;&gt; that's not father's identity &gt;&gt; and that church identity does not give you your new name &gt;&gt; so after Peter had been saved and sanctified give power to cast unclean spirits to preach the gospel Jesus plainly told him he was not converted until received the Holy Ghost. And he said, "After you're converted, strengthen your brethren." That was on the night of the betrayal. So saints, it's so easy to confuse this. What Holy Ghost? Uh what is the Holy Ghost? The Peter had already received gifts of the Holy Ghost before before Christ ascended, right? Peter was went out praying for the sick, casting out devils. We know that. You mean even with that, he didn't know who he was? &gt;&gt; Yes. because then he denied him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Three times. &gt;&gt; But after Acts chapter 2, &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; That same guy who was stuttering and failing and denying the Lord and running back to fishing naked now stands there openly saying, "What? Don't you know what this is? This is that which the prophet Joel prophesied of." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. He became someone with identity. He said, "Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give I thee. &gt;&gt; This doesn't mean it is the same for everyone. Peter's conception, birth, conversion happened at a very different pace compared with Paul. So what I'm saying is you'll have some people they'll be baptized with the Holy Ghost. They'll start receiving identity from the next day. Why? There's a fire lit under them. They're traveling to Russia to spread the gospel. &gt;&gt; You still sitting at home. It happens at a totally different pace. There was Peter. What happened with Paul? Paul meets the purifier. He has his conception at Damascus. He has his new birth. He has to wait for his new birth. He's blind. He goes to Ananas. Ananas gets a message from the Holy Ghost telling him Paul is coming. He says to Ananas, you will pray for Paul. Paul will receive his sight. Then he will receive the Holy Ghost. He receives the new birth. When Ananas prays for him and his blindness is gone. Then brother Baron says Paul goes to Egypt for 3 years. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To study the word to get all the other stuff out of him and come back. And then he comes back and he confronts Peter and James and all them and he says to them, "Uh, you're doing this wrong. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be doing this. &gt;&gt; Isn't the gospel of Christ uh supposed to be Jews and Gentiles? No male, no female. No, this why are you separating them? Why are you bringing back your This guy who came from &gt;&gt; he's got he's getting identity. Yes, &gt;&gt; he had to still go through his conversion completely different pace. And then he comes out and identifies himself as the apostle to the Gentiles. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Like the other believers would be like, "What a nerve." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who does he think he is? He wasn't even there in the upper room. He wasn't even there with the prophet. &gt;&gt; He didn't see what we see. He wasn't even in the meetings. What a nerve. Completely different. Hebrews chapter 2 part one paragraph 14 then you see God doesn't deal with organizations he doesn't deal with groups of people he deals with individuals he reveals himself to individuals and now to say this God knows my heart not to say this for own personal praise just to be there but did you know that the same God the same Jesus is with us this morning do you know each one of you has a little individual witness of it right now that he's here. He's done something for us in this day. He didn't do it in other days. He had his picture taken in this day. We got it hanging right here to purify the same Lord Jesus. Watch how he works now. If he's the same Lord Jesus, he will do the same things. For the Bible say the same yesterday, today, and forever. Paris 16. Now, before Paul would announce anything, whether it was right or wrong, he first went down into Egypt and spent 3 years to find out if it was scriptural or not. Did you ever know that after Paul's conversion he went to Egypt for 3 years there he abode there is where he learned his great wisdom he actually got identity outside of the apostles &gt;&gt; outside of the church &gt;&gt; you're only manifesting sunship after you're converted &gt;&gt; while you're You're unconverted. You're still a baby. You haven't come to sunship yet. This is what the true message of adoption needs to be. How do how are we preaching adoption to message people while treating them like babies? And the message God's wrapped gift. This is our last quote. Oh, no, it's not. Gracious. Still got a little bit more. And even uh upon those it fell on the in the beginning the children's organized denominated went bound into organizations till they're refusing the very god that their fathers receive. They claim their Pentecostal. Oh no doesn't make a s a horse to live in a barn. See you didn't even laugh at that. The city people know nothing. [Music] He says it it doesn't make a pig a a female pig a horse if she lives in a barn. You know what that means? No. Indeed. No more than it does to make a Christian out of a man belonging to a Pentecostal church, &gt;&gt; Baptist, Presbyterian, message church. &gt;&gt; He's still a sinner until he's converted. It doesn't make you a Christian just because you belong to a church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; When he's converted, he's born again of the spirit of God changed over. He's accepted Christ. The Holy Ghost has come, made him a new creature, a new creation. &gt;&gt; Since this makes me look at things differently, other people look at sinning like it's bad things. &gt;&gt; For me, sinning is becoming Wait. To me, uh, sinning has become about doing, uh, or or good things or bad things that do not benefit my position in Christ. I'm saying it again. Doing good things or or bad things. So, even doing good things that do not benefit my position in Christ is sinning. Even if I'm doing good, I'm a good message believer. I come to church, I read the message, I go through the motions, I go to all the conventions, I go to the combined meetings, but I'm doing nothing to further my position as a son of God, I'm still sinning. &gt;&gt; Because there's no conversion. Yeah. I I I tell youngsters, you go off, you want to make a career for yourself, you choose a career that takes you away from the word, that's sinning. Cuz you were chosen to be a son of God. How will you choose something? So listen, don't come and tell me you got a gift to playing soccer. You might go play for Barcelona. Don't worry. I'm a son of God. Well, I got no worries because I know where you're going to be. There's no such thing as playing for Barcelona or Real Madrid or Liverpool or whoever and tell me you're going to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; You are not going to win a single soul to Christ. Every time you put the jersey on or raise a cup or win something, it's all going to be self worship. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Everything in this world that you do that is self worship is sinning. Because you are, listen, the gloves are off now. We're not talking about drinking, smoking, fornicating, and all that. You are called to be a son of God, the bride of Christ. You claim it every day. You fellowship about it. You put it on the WhatsApp groups, but then you go act like a normal person out there. What? Work, pay the bills, put your kids through school, go to universities. Suffice it. Everything for Caesar. You're still sinning. Don't tell me you're walking in sunship. Types and shadows. Living in sin needs to change. It needs to refine itself. What are you doing with your existence and the open book that has been given to you? Types and shadows. Abraham received circumcision long after the call, right? He got the call, received the circumcision, and actually 25 years later, he got the promis. See, everybody in the message wants it. Now, I want the I want to be gotten. I want the Holy Ghost. I want the power. I want to take control of my life. I want to be recognized. You want to be recognized without going through the training. You want to You want your name to be out there without even going through the hardships? What? All these men slogged. Even the Christ who died for you, went to Gethsemane for you, went to the the Calvary road for you, went to the cross for you, and you want it all now in one second. Number two, Israel took 40 years to reach the promised land. David was anointed by Samuel. He only hit the throne as king long after he was anointed king. &gt;&gt; He ran for his life most of the time and had to learn what it was to be a fugitive. The Lord Jesus was the only begotten son of the flesh. But his ministry only began after John's baptism at Jordan where the spirit of God descended upon him like a dove. Peter was only converted after Acts chapter 2. Nobody gets it in one go. Nobody gets it young people in one youth camp. &gt;&gt; Luke 22:32. But I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail thee not when thou art converted. Strengthen thy brethren. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want to ask you. This is where we are where we ought to be right now. Strengthening our brethren. This is my issue with the majority of message people. You live irresponsibly. You talk a whole lot at church or on WhatsApp groups or on fellowship. Anyone can send quotes and scriptures. Anyone can do stuff like that. But if you live irresponsibly where you don't strengthen your brethren, you are living out of purpose. &gt;&gt; Period. &gt;&gt; Amen. Question and answers paragraph 46. Now we take the wrong in the word of conversion. Today we say that a man that's converted is a man that stopped drinking and everything, goes to church or joins the church. He might join the church but there's no sign he's converted. He isn't converted until his old life is dead and he's buried in Christ, risen with him, resurrection, newness of life when the Holy Spirit has created in him a new a living hope of eternal life. Saints, conversion is much more than what we assumed it to be. It means to be changed, turned around. This only has been made known by the revealing of the mysteries of the day. &gt;&gt; This conversion stage is only when God can reveal the mysteries to you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; After you know his identity, church's identity and you're learning your identity is the only time he can give you the open book. is the only time he can reveal mysteries to you. When you've made a conscious decision, the body is being converted by the word that is being revealed in it. Not that you won't make mistakes, but they'll the body will come under your subjection. Conversion is where the mysteries can be revealed to us. Conversion is where you are able to strengthen your brethren. Conversion is when you get your full identity. We are not dependent on mother church anymore. The church is now dependent on you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To do your purpose for bringing forth more sons. The prophet speaks of being convinced than concerned. He said you will never be concerned unless you are first convinced. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can never be convinced until you are converted by the person of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; As long as you have never received the new birth, don't tell me you got a desire to serve God's people. You're still a baby. You still depended on us. Right. The prophet speaks of being right. You are not convinced by intellectualism. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not convinced because the message makes sense. Young man, young woman. Because brother Al breaks it down so nicely for us. It's so simple for us to understand. It makes so much of sense. Glory to God. Hallelujah. It's not got to make sense. It's got to be absorbed as an identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not convinced by intellectualism. This is a definite individual experience. Conversion is an individual experience. Anyone listen, anyone can have concern for people. There's many of us like that. There's many people out there who work for nonprofits and charity runs and they're genuinely concerned for people. That's not what we're talking about. Those people are concerned for people to feed their stomachs, to give them clothes. Where are the people who are concerned for the condition of souls? Where is that? H to have real concern for God's flock involves something else altogether. Let's read unfailing realities of the living God. We're closing now. The Holy Spirit comes today like mannered to present God to man. I I I read this already. Okay. Peter had been saved. Let's bypass that. I want to go to the next one. What was the Holy Ghost given for? Oh, hold on a bit. Okay, let's go to what was the Holy Ghost given for. He said, "Peter, I prayed for you." That's not Listen, that's not all of it. I prayed for you and after you are converted and strengthen your brethren. After you're converted, he shouted. He had probably danced in the spirit. He had done all kinds of things. He had done received the Holy Ghost, but he hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet. Here's the other thing. This is what I've been trying to tell you before and speaking to other message people. You shouted, danced in the spirit, all those things, and still not received the Holy Ghost yet. What's been preached now as the message is bringing back all this shouting, dancing, screaming, emotions and saying that's the Holy Ghost. When you've got the prophet literally saying you haven't received the Holy Ghost yet. &gt;&gt; Listen, shouting, dancing, screaming is church identity. &gt;&gt; It's not father's identity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost must give you father's identity. Must connect you to your father. You must know who he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; The only thing I see amongst churches is they all know who they are, &gt;&gt; who the church is. That's how they act. That's how they shout. That's how they worship. You literally get to another place and they say, "We're going to show you how we do it here. &gt;&gt; I'm not interested in how you do it. I do me pretty fine. Thank you. I don't need to be like anybody else." &gt;&gt; Amen. And he says, "After you are converted, then strengthen your brethren." I like this last part. "Cry out his plan." Praise be to God. Carry out his plan. Conversion is coming into his plan. So lastly, in closing, he says, he says something amazing. You know, in um in John 21:15-17, Jesus said to Peter, "Peter, do you love me? Feed my lambs. Two verses later, Peter, do you love me? Yes, Lord, feed my sheep. Third time, Peter, do you love me? Peter goes, Lord, you know all things. It's like, why you asked me this so many times? He says, feed my sheep. So, brother man was asked this question. Why did he say, "Feed my lambs and feed my sheep." Right? So, watch what he said. Said, "You love me, Peter, feed my sheep." I like that. "Feed my sheep. Feed my sheep." And this is for ministers. He says, "Don't drive them. Don't feed uh don't drive them. Feed them." He didn't say, "Drive them. &gt;&gt; Feed them." The word. They like sheep food. The sheep food is the good old time feeling of old time salvation. Just as free as you can feel. And there is no condemnation. &gt;&gt; You feed sheep sheep food that has no condemnation. We used to stand and clap our hands. I feel all right. There's no condemnation in my heart. Okay, I want you to go back home. I don't have the time to do it now. Go check all the other quotes. Brother Bam says in another quote, he said he said feed my sheep. He said he didn't say kick them. He didn't say drive them. &gt;&gt; Don't put a burden on them to make them crawl and see them suffer. Said ministers instead of feeding them, they take them to shear them. He said they make them pledge their homes, their old age pensions and everything. The prophet said that you strip them of their money, their livelihoods. &gt;&gt; Take everything from them and don't feed them. Says don't give them and another quoter said don't give them educational programs and denominational weeds. &gt;&gt; Feed them truth. He said, &gt;&gt; "Feed them sheep food. That's what they need." Strengthening your brethren and feeding my sheep are both character linked to conversion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Feed my sheep. Strengthen your brethren. After you're converted, did did you see that? &gt;&gt; Okay. The true sign of the Holy Ghost. This is it, saints. This is my concern. You can we can go out and feed hungry people. We can go out and give clothes. I do that. I I meet somebody, I'll pay for their groceries or something. It's from the bottom of my heart, but they look at me and think, "Oh, what a nice man." That's all, and then they go away. Nobody says he's got the word of God. &gt;&gt; You can feed hungry. This is why Peter Paul said, "Though I give to charity, though I give to the poor, I'm still nothing." &gt;&gt; The true sign of the Holy Ghost is crying and sighing for the sin of your community. The true side of the Holy Ghost is the care for the souls of man. The care for the sinfulness of the souls of man. That's the true sign of the Holy Ghost. That's father's identity. Father's identity is God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believe shall not perish but have everlasting life. Father's identity is he cares for the souls of man. You may be in a you know knowing the struggle and challenge of the time. What are we doing to strengthen those who are struggling spiritually? It's easy for you here in this church. You get along with people who are strong. You have lunches and dinners with each other. You get together and have a bri on a Saturday. But there are people here who are struggling spiritually. Are you strengthening your brethren? Are you recognize recognizing their need? They're struggling spiritually. Some of you won't even wait around to chat with them in a car park, let alone inviting them for a meal. We don't really care about their stomachs. Knowing the struggle and challenge of the time, what are we doing to strengthen those who are struggling spiritually? How are we feeding the sheep? You may be in a begotten stage enjoying church, feeding off the church, benefiting from it, and think you have reached your purpose. Well, let me tell you what's going to happen because that's what's happening right now in the message. The people you grow up in the message, the message turns you into this great person. You get married. You go off get your job. You get your millions. You bring up your children. You put them through the best schools. You bring them up into the public. And then you leave the message and call brother a false prophet. &gt;&gt; And you walk away from us and you benefited from us all the years only to slap us in the face on your way out. &gt;&gt; That's what's happening right now. You should rather leave. Leave and tell us nothing. We don't want to know what you believe. Just leave us alone. You sucked us off like a parasite for many years only to come back at the end after you were nothing and got educated here, learned the gospel, learned the Bible, learned the message, became a professor of the message, only to correct the person you learned from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And call him a false prophet. &gt;&gt; Why not just leave? Don't tell us anything. Don't tell us what you know. Don't tell us. Just leave quietly and let us lick our wounds for having taken care of you for all these years while the rest of us lived responsibly, lived our lives, lived without sin, lived without falling for you. Then you grow up and slap us in the face on your way out. &gt;&gt; That is not even disingenuous. That is immoral. That is low in character. Just leave. have the feeling of galial. Go away. Say this in your heart. If it is of God, it will prosper. Let me not say any evil thing about it. &gt;&gt; Do that. But this is what's happening. And you young people get that notion. I'm telling you, brother El's not going to be a nice guy in that day. You come to me with that story. You're going to see something you haven't seen before. I'm not going to sit there and listen to you tell me what the message is and what the Bible is after we've taken care of you and raised you up with kid gloves and love in our hearts. You can do that somewhere else where there's other church who subjugated you and ruled you with a rod of iron. But here where we treated you gently, answered your questions, labored with you, and then you come to that spot where light bulb goes off in your head and you want to tell me brother's a false prophet. Just walk away quietly. That'll be better. &gt;&gt; You may have been born of the spirit, become someone who identify yourself with a message group and a prophet. You're singing songs. You're enjoying your identity in the community. You enjoy your participation. You sing song specials. You like to be noticed. You like to be appreciated. You've even been conforming with some real stiff standards and laws because you feel safe with mother. H. What's going to happen? Russia bombs someone. You're going to run back here and feel safe. &gt;&gt; Oh, just let California sink and watch all those hypocrites come running back. But then when the mysteries are being preached, you become discouraged. When the real tough challenging things in the word are being taught that will separate goats from the sheep and it is time for identity to change. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to see. I want to see people who are not depending on church identity. I want to see people who are not depending on father's identity. I want to see sons of god come to their identity. Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to I want to die someday knowing I've preached a word that has brought people to their identity. Given them the ability to go out and speak the word. There is absolutely no excuse. Young man, you are over 18 and you're in university and college. You are in the working world. You have no excuse for not talking about Christ. And don't give me that shy story. Talk about everything else. You have no excuse for not saying I believe this message to tell people I believe this message. This is what I stand for. I do not do that. I do not participate in that. This is what I believe. Our prophet was brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; I believe in the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; This is my church. This is what we stand for. You have no excuse for not talking about it. All the people you've gone 20 years in the message you're working in all your companies you have no excuse for succumbing to their ideas. &gt;&gt; It is time. The challenge is now. It is time. Those challenging things of the word are being taught right now and they will separate sheep from the goats. Remember I told you a while back you want to look for everything elsewhere. Mark of the beast everywhere else you will have to look left and right. right where you sit there are people experiencing right now if I tell you the number of parents I'm getting messages from people in other countries in other cities in this country saying pray for my children they have left the message brother Alistister please pray for my three children they have left the message that time's coming. That time's coming for you. It's time to know. And is this a, you know, those of you, you got children who are still young and think you got a life sorted, wait till they're teenagers. Those of you who don't even have children yet. And this this is the the tragedy of people who think they can leave the message while they have children that are still young. Tell tell me what you got out there. Just just tell me which denomination do you go to that's that's going to help your kids out there. &gt;&gt; What do you have out there? &gt;&gt; It's not even logical. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. It won't even be long. Your daughter will be acting like a guy dressing like a not even 5 minutes and your son is going to be a weirdo. Not even 5 minutes. They'll turn against you in a heartbeat. If you know anything about human nature, the moment your son is in love with a girl, he turns away from you immediately. Then what do you have to say? You've got no faith base. You've got no church. You've got no Holy Ghost. You've got no father's identity. You've got no mother's identity. What identity do you have in your home? Where's your moral standard? Where's anything that you have to hold your children to? You've got nothing. And it's all those people who leave and find out the hard way what happens. You young people, you you come to that point in your life where you feel like I know everything right now. I can leave what mom and dad said. I can go do my own thing. You're heading down a slippery slope. &gt;&gt; You have been commissioned. You have been given father's identity for a reason. You got to find your identity. You've got to be converted. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's time to know and embrace your identity in Christ. It is the time now for those of full age to stand and strengthen what remains and feed his sheep. When you are converted, when you are converted, you'll have no desire to leave. You'll have a desire to strengthen your brethren. &gt;&gt; That will consume you. If if I I'm I'm closing. My notes are down. If I look at every one of the the saints of God in the past, all of them who got the Holy Ghost, all of them who got that desire, they literally left families, traveled across the world, got into ships, got on horseback, came back home after months to see wife and children, left them bringing back maybe tuppens or change to give them money to survive. Fortunately, in those days, they were growing their own foods, having their own goat and sheep and cattle and feeding themselves. They didn't have to have jobs. But yes, but they went and did those things to strengthen their brethren, to take the word to the world, to speak to others around them. While daddy was gone preaching in Italy somewhere in Rome, mom and children were at home speaking to those in the neighborhood. It's not only daddy's job.
