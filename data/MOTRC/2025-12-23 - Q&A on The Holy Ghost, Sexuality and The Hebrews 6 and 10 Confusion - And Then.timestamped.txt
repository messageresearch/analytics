[0:06] So once again saints uh greetings and uh
[0:10] to all of you uh in the name of the Lord
[0:12] Jesus Christ and uh wonderful to be
[0:16] back. It feels like a like a long time
[0:19] uh but we're thankful to God for his
[0:21] healing and uh his grace with us and we
[0:25] certainly appreciate uh all that he does
[0:28] for us. So this evening I want to break
[0:31] away from the book of Genesis.
[0:34] I've had um um as you know many
[0:38] questions from the youth from the young
[0:41] people
[0:42] uh all through the second half of this
[0:44] year and I want to address some of those
[0:47] questions. As you all know during
[0:49] December we have what we call here uh
[0:52] family month. It's just with our church
[0:55] and uh we call it family month and it's
[0:57] a time where we uh use the services to
[1:00] speak about things concerning the youth
[1:02] and parenting and and uh family life and
[1:06] so on. We've done it for several years
[1:08] now. And um
[1:11] so I've had some questions that I wanted
[1:16] to take a while to uh address. uh and I
[1:20] wanted to think on that and uh certain
[1:23] things have happened and uh I I really
[1:26] wanted to find the mind of the Lord in
[1:29] it and you do the right thing and uh so
[1:32] that's what we want to do this evening
[1:34] and probably get to two or three
[1:36] questions and uh trust the Lord for his
[1:39] leading. So we're going to uh share the
[1:43] screen and um
[1:46] begin with our scripture reading. We're
[1:49] going to
[1:51] um [clears throat]
[1:54] read um [snorts] from Hebrews chapter 6
[1:58] verse 4-6
[2:00] and then also Hebrews chap 10 26.
[2:04] Uh, and so we're going to be dealing
[2:06] with this is question and answers 2025
[2:08] part 8. And uh, the Holy Ghost,
[2:12] sexuality, and uh, Hebrews 6 and10
[2:15] confusion
[2:17] and um, for [clears throat] a title,
[2:20] does tasting of the heavenly gift and
[2:22] then backsliding mean you're lost
[2:25] forever?
[2:26] All right, so we want to begin by
[2:28] reading Hebrews 6:4-6.
[2:33] And the word of God reads like this. For
[2:34] it is impossible for those who are once
[2:38] enlightened and have tasted of the
[2:40] heavenly gift and were made partakers of
[2:43] the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good
[2:46] word of God and the powers of the world
[2:48] to come. If they shall fall away to
[2:51] renew them again unto repentance, seeing
[2:54] they crucify to themselves the Son of
[2:57] God Aresh, and put him to an open shame.
[3:00] So look at that scripture. It looks,
[3:03] look at what it says. It is impossible
[3:05] for those who were once enlightened. So
[3:08] to have been enlightened, to have tasted
[3:10] of the heavenly gift, to partakers of
[3:12] the Holy Ghost, if you fall away, the
[3:15] scripture looks like it's saying it's
[3:17] impossible to renew you again to
[3:20] repentance.
[3:22] Uh Hebrews 10:26,
[3:24] "For if we sin willfully after that we
[3:27] have received the knowledge of the
[3:28] truth, there remainth no more sacrifice
[3:32] for sin."
[3:35] All right. So um this looks like some
[3:38] terrifying scripture and um so I know
[3:42] that's the reason why it is so
[3:44] troublesome to young people who don't
[3:47] really understand uh the word. So, like
[3:50] we said, um, question and answers 2025
[3:55] part 8.
[3:57] Um, and we're dealing with our subject,
[3:59] the Holy Ghost, sexuality, and the
[4:02] Hebrews 6 and 10, confusion. That's what
[4:05] I'm going to call it. And for a title,
[4:08] does tasting of the heavenly gift and
[4:10] then backsliding mean you're lost
[4:13] forever?
[4:15] All right. So
[4:17] everything I I want to start by saying
[4:20] everything we are doing
[4:22] right now in the ministry is for the
[4:25] young people of the message who are
[4:27] disillusioned,
[4:29] questioning and confused and not finding
[4:32] fulfillment in the word. Do we have all
[4:36] the answers? No. But we are answering
[4:39] the questions that come to us. Why do we
[4:42] put it out? Is it because we feel we
[4:45] have a special ministry or that we can
[4:48] have the answers for the world? No.
[4:51] Perhaps it will uh help those who are
[4:55] going through the same thing. We are not
[4:57] concerned about causing division or
[5:00] anything else because everyone has their
[5:03] own self-will to choose to listen to
[5:05] what we say or not.
[5:07] Uh if it is not for you and you take
[5:10] offense to the way we speak, I encourage
[5:13] you to not listen to us and pay no
[5:16] attention to us at all. We are not
[5:18] narcissistic to think that we are the
[5:21] ones with the answers for the world or
[5:23] that we are putting out our videos or
[5:26] whatever it is because we want to u gain
[5:30] control somehow. No, it is none of that.
[5:33] Our concern is particularly because God
[5:36] has placed a burden on our heart for the
[5:39] young people.
[5:41] All right. So
[5:44] first I want to talk about something
[5:46] personal
[5:48] and I want to begin with saying I take
[5:50] full responsibility for the things that
[5:52] I say from the pulpit and anything that
[5:55] goes online.
[5:57] Nobody is to blame for anything I say.
[6:01] If people clip the videos that we use
[6:03] and use it, I know that I cannot blame
[6:06] them because I've allowed it myself
[6:10] to be online and in the public space.
[6:13] So, I know this and I am no crybaby. If
[6:16] people take advantage of what we put
[6:18] out, some of them are good people and
[6:21] some of them may be controlled by
[6:23] demonology.
[6:24] Um, it's fair game and um we're not
[6:28] complaining about that.
[6:31] So, but I want to start with saying
[6:34] nobody
[6:36] was not even not myself uh either was
[6:39] ever going to predict the outcome of my
[6:42] last trip to North America.
[6:45] I was invited to speak to the youth and
[6:48] the Lord laid it on my heart to speak on
[6:52] sexuality, a subject I have spoke I've
[6:55] spoken in Africa uh since 2013 2014 at
[6:59] youth camps, youth meetings in different
[7:02] formats, in different ways. And then the
[7:05] Lord laid it on my heart to speak on the
[7:07] Holy Ghost because these were the two
[7:10] topics that the youth globally were
[7:13] having struggles with. Of course, I
[7:16] expected some resistance from the usual
[7:18] suspects who just disagree with
[7:20] everything you say simply because it's
[7:22] you. They listen to you with a filter
[7:25] that you are wrong from the start and
[7:28] whatever you say from the beginning is
[7:30] just false. So, I expect that.
[7:34] But the visceral reaction that followed
[7:37] from those who some of them who know me
[7:40] well and others who I've never met
[7:43] really surprised me. The levels of fear
[7:46] and immaturity was shocking and
[7:49] appalling.
[7:51] One thing that certainly happened was
[7:54] after this I got them all revisiting the
[7:56] Holy Ghost and sexuality with a gusto
[8:00] and fervor that was I would say quite
[8:02] commendable.
[8:04] We had some ministers who said their
[8:07] wives couldn't handle hearing about
[8:09] sexuality from the pulpit and that it
[8:11] was inappropriate to talk about such
[8:14] things. The poor things must have been
[8:15] blushing and fainting as if they lived
[8:18] in the Victorian age of feigned
[8:20] femininity.
[8:22] Of course, we always have those who
[8:24] believe it's too uncomfortable to speak
[8:27] to both boys and girls together because
[8:30] that's the way brother Banham did it.
[8:32] You know, so I guess that uh you have to
[8:35] do everything the way brother Brandham
[8:37] did it. You know, when you talk about
[8:38] the birth of a child, you must apologize
[8:41] to the sisters. When you speak about the
[8:43] of Revelation 17, you must
[8:46] apologize to the sisters. When you speak
[8:48] about uh Abraham having relations with
[8:51] his wife, it's at an old age. You must
[8:54] apologize to the sisters. If you want to
[8:56] do everything brother Bham did, then you
[8:58] must do everything brother Bam did.
[8:59] We'll hold you to that.
[9:02] You should hear the message. Boys and
[9:04] girls who speak to us together without a
[9:08] filter. At one youth camp I did many
[9:12] years ago, I thought that the subject on
[9:14] sexuality was too sensitive for youth
[9:17] under 16. So we separated them. And
[9:20] after the camp, I had strong message
[9:22] parents asking with great concern why
[9:26] their children that were under 16 were
[9:28] left out. And the kids were complaining
[9:31] that they were not babies and that they
[9:33] learned this stuff in school. So here
[9:35] was I thinking that it it was too
[9:37] sensitive a topic for 13 year olds and
[9:40] yet the kids and the parents didn't
[9:42] think so.
[9:44] But these things I don't mind. There are
[9:47] some really cultural people in the world
[9:50] who come from really really conservative
[9:53] backgrounds and uh you know some places
[9:56] you go people are just sensitive and I
[9:59] don't really mind those sort of
[10:01] reactions.
[10:03] I just didn't expect it from the western
[10:05] world where they live in a society that
[10:07] is so openly sexual about everything uh
[10:11] that it makes us Africans uncomfortable.
[10:16] But then came the Holy Ghost debacle
[10:18] which just rubbed people up the wrong
[10:21] way. There were differences on emotions.
[10:25] I get that. Like if somebody thinks, you
[10:28] know, I'm speaking against having
[10:30] emotions or an atmosphere in the church
[10:33] where people are shouting and screaming
[10:34] and and if they took offense to me
[10:37] thinking that I feel like we shouldn't
[10:39] have those things, I I get that. I
[10:41] understand that. Of course, that's wrong
[10:43] and it's not what I believe. I believe
[10:45] in emotions. I'm an emotional person. I
[10:47] believe in expression. When you hear the
[10:50] word of God, I am an expressive person.
[10:53] Then there were differences on the word
[10:57] spirit and ghost. And I get that because
[11:01] uh they didn't understand what I was
[11:02] saying. But then there were those who
[11:06] tied it all together.
[11:08] Now I don't go looking for people online
[11:11] to see who talks about me because I
[11:13] don't care. People send me links to ask
[11:16] me if I've heard this that someone said
[11:18] about me when I hear it and I realize it
[11:21] might be someone who is an elder or
[11:23] someone whom I know or I don't know but
[11:27] maybe I respect because they're they're
[11:29] an elder. They're somebody in the
[11:31] message for a very long time. I reach
[11:33] out as a brother should in a in peace to
[11:37] regain my brother. And um you know when
[11:42] people disagree with what you preach,
[11:44] that's fine. I um I have no problem with
[11:48] with that. I actually love it when
[11:50] people disagree with me because I learn
[11:52] more. And um and if people disagree with
[11:55] you and uh you know, whatever you with
[11:58] whatever you preach, it's fine. And they
[12:00] they double down on what they believe,
[12:02] that's perfect. It's what you ought to
[12:04] do if God has revealed it to you that
[12:07] way. I have no problem with that and I
[12:10] love it. It makes me examine myself
[12:14] uh and uh it it makes me question things
[12:16] that I believe and look at things in a
[12:18] different way.
[12:20] But what I have a problem with is name
[12:24] calling that goes to the highest degree
[12:27] that it becomes evil and narcissistic
[12:30] and elitist.
[12:33] What do you do with that when they do
[12:35] that to you?
[12:37] So for me, there are those in the
[12:40] ministry
[12:42] uh that had the boldness to use my name,
[12:45] to speak out on platforms, warning
[12:47] people not to have me on their pulpits,
[12:50] to not give me the microphone,
[12:52] or
[12:54] who literally call you a Ricky and a
[12:57] fallen angel. Uh some speaking about you
[13:02] but not using your name for plausible
[13:04] deniability.
[13:06] yet knowing full well that everybody
[13:08] knows exactly who they're talking about.
[13:10] Uh so the one minister who calls called
[13:13] me a Ricky and a fallen angel
[13:16] uh you know it those are serious
[13:20] uh um name calling. That's serious name
[13:24] calling. Um the definition of Ricky as
[13:27] brother Brandham describes it from his
[13:29] perspective in the message is someone
[13:31] who is immoral. someone who uh like you
[13:35] hear about it, they have their hot rods
[13:38] and go out and sleep around and drink
[13:40] beer and and uh that that's what he
[13:43] calls Ricky's in the message to have a
[13:47] minister fellow minister in the message
[13:49] call you this over the pulpit and then a
[13:52] fallen angel that's referring to the
[13:54] scripture where it says
[13:56] you know uh if any man teaches something
[13:59] that I have not you know whether it been
[14:01] angel or so on you or let him be
[14:03] accursed. I've heard that. And then also
[14:06] a fallen angel, meaning people, you
[14:08] know, the angels kicked out of heaven
[14:10] and lost their position and come down to
[14:13] possess man. And you know, those are
[14:16] serious
[14:17] uh name call. That's serious name
[14:20] calling. That is to the to the highest
[14:22] degree. It's not even like just
[14:26] gossiping about someone or belittling
[14:28] someone. that is denigrating somebody to
[14:31] um the lowest possible thing you could
[14:33] ever do. They don't hold back. Then they
[14:37] say you will bring in nickelotinism
[14:41] and you are you are going to try and
[14:43] cause the people to not get the spirit
[14:47] and also call what you preached in
[14:50] sexuality and the holy ghost. They call
[14:53] it psychology and junk.
[14:57] So they did this on a public platform
[15:00] and this is u this is a new time in the
[15:03] world. This the social media YouTube,
[15:06] Instagram, uh all these other social
[15:10] media platforms. It's a it's a new
[15:12] beast. It's a new addition to the fourth
[15:14] dimension and it can be used profitably
[15:17] to pass the word to the world or it can
[15:21] be used as uh for rather for very
[15:25] nefarious purposes.
[15:28] So what do you do right what do you do
[15:31] when they call you stuff like this? So
[15:33] first thing you do is you reach out to
[15:35] them as a brother and you ask to speak
[15:38] with them so there could be an
[15:39] understanding between brothers and if
[15:42] they respond uh and chat with you you
[15:44] can discuss your differences and let the
[15:47] spirit of God lead you towards peace and
[15:50] and you may still not agree but still
[15:52] you'll be brothers right if all you get
[15:55] is indifference or no acknowledgement at
[15:58] all that you even reached out to them
[16:02] you send them letters You send them
[16:03] WhatsApp messages. You can even see it's
[16:05] blue ticked, but all you get is radio
[16:08] silence,
[16:10] not even an acknowledgement that you
[16:12] messaged them or reached out to them.
[16:14] Then what do you do? Right now, I know
[16:17] we will have some believers who who say,
[16:20] you know, the best thing is to do the
[16:22] best thing to do is not respond. Just
[16:24] let God deal with them. We'll have other
[16:26] legalists who will say, just pray for
[16:28] them.
[16:29] To me, those are fearful methods that
[16:32] are used by some people who are afraid
[16:34] of confrontation.
[16:36] And I'm not one of those people.
[16:39] Um,
[16:41] having God deal with them. If if I've
[16:44] learned anything in this life is that
[16:47] God deals with things through his
[16:49] people.
[16:50] Now, what would have been the right
[16:53] thing for those ministers to do when
[16:57] they heard what I preached? Easy.
[17:00] Just call me up. It's not hard to get my
[17:03] number. Some of them have my number.
[17:05] Just call me up. Brother Al, did you
[17:08] mean to say that the Holy Ghost cannot
[17:10] take away sexual lust? Is that what you
[17:14] were trying to say? Or Brother Al, are
[17:16] you saying that the Holy Ghost and the
[17:18] Holy Spirit are two different things? Do
[17:20] you know there are quotes where the
[17:22] prophet said they are the same thing?
[17:25] That's all it takes? Pick up the phone,
[17:28] call me before you get on the pulpit and
[17:31] decide you know what I said and you have
[17:34] the right to interpret it the way you
[17:36] want to. Just call me, talk to me and
[17:40] then I will explain myself to you. Then
[17:43] you have a proper understanding as
[17:44] brothers and then you go on your pulpit
[17:47] and correct me if you wish to with the
[17:48] right attitude and with more knowledge
[17:51] of what I meant.
[17:53] But when you refuse to talk to me and
[17:56] you talk among those who agree with you,
[17:58] you spread bad word about me or not even
[18:01] knowing me, then go to the pulpit and
[18:03] call me Ricky and fallen angel and make
[18:06] claims of things that I said that I
[18:08] didn't say that way. Not even in the way
[18:12] you are saying that I meant it. This is
[18:15] not the way brothers should act. You
[18:18] should know I've been working my whole
[18:20] life to get young people to understand
[18:22] the prophet from a modern-day
[18:25] perspective because they don't
[18:26] understand him from an older generation
[18:29] perspective. I have literally been
[18:31] drawing hundreds of young people back to
[18:33] the word where and when you do things
[18:36] like this, you put us a step back.
[18:40] Now, in this new social media age, I
[18:43] believe that we can display how to
[18:47] disagree respectfully and do things the
[18:49] right way in public forums and public
[18:53] platforms when you have already tried to
[18:56] engage on a personal level and been
[18:59] outright ignored. What is it that you
[19:01] do? And so, I want to be able to tell
[19:04] the young people because you're going to
[19:06] come across this. You're going to be
[19:09] you're going to have these experiences
[19:10] in the future. What do you do when you
[19:13] have people who you respect who then
[19:16] call you names and do such things to you
[19:19] in public? It's really something that we
[19:22] ought to learn. So I want to um I want
[19:27] to tell you here's what you should do.
[19:29] Number one,
[19:31] always remain respectful, but do not be
[19:34] afraid to speak firm and with
[19:36] conviction.
[19:38] Number two, give them the benefit of the
[19:40] doubt that perhaps they still don't
[19:42] understand what you believe. Number
[19:44] three, assume that you may not properly
[19:47] understand what they believe. Number
[19:50] four, ask questions to challenge their
[19:52] belief so that you can get answers.
[19:56] Number five, always bear in mind there
[19:59] is a world that is watching, ready to
[20:02] pounce on what all of us believe and
[20:05] will use what you do to discredit the
[20:08] word, not you. Number six, stay on point
[20:13] and let the word speak for itself.
[20:16] Number seven, always leave room for the
[20:19] fact that everything you see as evidence
[20:22] to yourself can be interpreted
[20:24] differently by someone else. Number
[20:27] eight, your ultimate objective is to let
[20:31] the word win in the end, even if you
[20:34] have to endure rejection and
[20:36] indifference.
[20:38] So that's the that's the perspective we
[20:41] ought to be approaching these things
[20:44] with. So with that, I'm going to try and
[20:46] stick to my own advice and not make this
[20:49] personal, but try to double down on what
[20:51] we taught and to uh simplify and
[20:55] reexplain it without a church format. So
[20:58] I'm not in a church format where there
[21:00] I'm preaching and people are shouting
[21:02] amens and egging you on and you're going
[21:05] to say something in an emotional way. Uh
[21:08] we're not doing that, right? So, I'm
[21:11] going to be be speaking as calmly as I
[21:13] can. I've taken a long time to do this,
[21:16] to address this in a way that I know I'm
[21:18] not in any state of anger or hurt or
[21:21] emotion. I'm completely calm and
[21:24] speaking out of concern for the young
[21:27] people of this generation.
[21:30] And you got to know when you're a when
[21:32] you become a minister and you and you
[21:34] come out into the public eye, you have
[21:37] you have to know you're opening yourself
[21:39] up to criticism and you must be able to
[21:41] handle it. You cannot be a baby in uh
[21:44] times like this. So uh that's what we
[21:47] want to do. So I want to start with um
[21:50] the first accusation.
[21:53] Okay. So there are three that we're
[21:54] going to get through before we get to
[21:55] the questions that the young people have
[21:58] asked me. And and the reason why I'm
[22:00] doing this again in this way is because
[22:04] it relates to the questions that I've
[22:06] had to address. And these questions I
[22:08] received from from a while back and I
[22:11] just didn't have the time to to address
[22:13] them. So let's begin with the first uh
[22:18] so the first accusation that came across
[22:21] was that we teach that the Holy Ghost
[22:25] cannot remedy sexual vice.
[22:29] We teach that the Holy Ghost. So
[22:31] obviously what I said at brother
[22:32] Dunqua's church uh this brother decided
[22:37] that the crux of what I was saying was
[22:40] that the Holy Ghost cannot remedy sexual
[22:44] problems, sexual vice, sexual obsession.
[22:47] Okay.
[22:49] Uh so number one there's your accusation
[22:55] and it's completely wrong. Sorry. What
[22:59] we are saying, and I want this to be as
[23:01] clear as possible. What we are saying is
[23:05] that the way of receiving the Holy Ghost
[23:09] that is currently being taught is not
[23:12] the remedy for sexual vice. That is if
[23:16] you are teaching young people that
[23:20] coming to youth camps, coming to the
[23:21] altar, having experience where you fall
[23:26] down, shout and scream, have some
[23:28] emotional manifestation
[23:31] and believe that that is the remedy for
[23:34] sexual vice, that is wrong.
[23:38] Yes. If you interpreted that's what I
[23:41] said, that's what I said, that's what I
[23:44] meant and that is the truth. We are
[23:46] saying this because of the testimony of
[23:49] hundreds of youth that are spiritually
[23:52] backsliden and sitting in churches and
[23:55] not satisfied with the word they are
[23:57] receiving.
[23:59] I also gave biblical proof that the Holy
[24:02] Ghost is not meant to be seen as a
[24:04] remedy for unrighteousness. I gave
[24:07] examples. We gave you the examples of
[24:09] David. David, the man who had the
[24:12] anointing on him that could play the
[24:14] harp and and cast out devils from King
[24:18] Saul. And uh this man having the Holy
[24:23] Spirit commits adultery, murders Uriah
[24:26] the Hitittite, plans his murder, commits
[24:30] adultery, and then when God uh brings
[24:33] conviction, he falls down and cries,
[24:36] "Take not thy holy spirit from me." I
[24:39] gave an example of Samson who while
[24:42] sleeping with a harlot wakes up with the
[24:45] spirit of God upon him stronger than any
[24:49] man in the history of mankind and takes
[24:52] on the Philistines.
[24:56] What what what I showed you is
[24:58] biblically these men have the Holy
[25:01] Spirit and still are living immoral. How
[25:04] then is the Holy Ghost seen as a remedy
[25:07] for sexual vice or obsession? Why are
[25:11] you telling the young people that this
[25:13] is the solution? It is not the solution.
[25:18] Uh and and definitely not the way you
[25:20] are teaching that the Holy Ghost or what
[25:23] the Holy Ghost is. If you're making a
[25:26] big deal about anointing, power, noise,
[25:30] emotions in church, uh, in church
[25:32] services, then the onus is on you to
[25:36] define what is true anointing.
[25:38] Anointing, define it. The atmosphere
[25:41] created in church must be here's the
[25:44] prophet's
[25:46] identification of atmosphere of the
[25:48] anointing. It must be the atmosphere of
[25:51] believing, not not running around and
[25:54] screaming and shouting and jumping and
[25:55] falling and slain in the spirit. If they
[25:58] do that, they must have come to the
[26:00] atmosphere of believing so that when the
[26:03] true word is being preached that
[26:06] [snorts] they believe. They believe it
[26:09] with their heart, with their soul, then
[26:11] you have the right anointing because
[26:12] it's the atmosphere of believing. But
[26:14] after you've got them into an atmosphere
[26:17] of whatever it is, emotions
[26:20] or if even if you bring them into an
[26:22] atmosphere of believing, then you must
[26:24] give them something to believe, right?
[26:27] Something concrete, something strong,
[26:29] something powerful, not the same old
[26:32] same old regurgitation of revelation
[26:35] from decades ago. This this doesn't help
[26:38] this generation.
[26:40] Okay?
[26:42] Anointing in the Bible is ability.
[26:46] Ability. Samson was given ability. Was a
[26:50] scrawny guy, thin, no strength. And when
[26:54] the spirit of God was upon him, it gave
[26:56] him ability.
[26:58] David was a ruddy young youth. But when
[27:01] the spirit of God was upon him, it gave
[27:03] him ability to kill the lion, the bear,
[27:05] the Philistines, the giant. Anointing is
[27:10] to give you ability for the purpose of
[27:13] God to be fulfilled. That is what
[27:15] anointing is. That's what the Holy Ghost
[27:18] is supposed to be for. Now, anyone can
[27:21] create atmospheres in church or at youth
[27:24] camps. Loud music, running around at
[27:27] specific songs, waving your arms,
[27:29] dancing, shouting, jumping, and hopping
[27:32] on the spot.
[27:34] But where's the anointing when you're at
[27:36] school? Where's the anointing when
[27:38] you're at work? Where's it in public or
[27:42] with your friends? Where's the ability
[27:44] that prevents you from fornicating,
[27:47] drinking, smoking, doing drugs, doing
[27:49] fraudulent business deals, disrespecting
[27:51] parents and elders, siding with the
[27:54] world over the word? It's so easy to
[27:57] have anointings in church, but where's
[27:59] the anointing
[28:01] outside where it is needed? Where is the
[28:04] ability
[28:06] to not fornicate, to not drink, to not
[28:08] smoke, to not do drugs, to not speak
[28:11] disrespectful? Where is the ability?
[28:13] That's the anointing.
[28:15] Not atmosphere of church, not atmosphere
[28:17] of worship. That is the anointing that
[28:20] you're supposed to be teaching, right?
[28:22] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got the liveliest
[28:24] church in the city or the liveliest
[28:27] church in the country. So what? That's
[28:30] the only place we see your liveless.
[28:32] You're dancing. You're shouting your
[28:34] emotions. Then you go back home after
[28:37] your church service to your depression,
[28:40] fighting with your wife and your
[28:41] children or your parents. And then you
[28:43] go back to social media and worldly
[28:46] friends who think you're cool. You sing
[28:48] and dance and shout hallelujah in church
[28:50] services every Sunday. And then you go
[28:53] and do sexy dancing to worldly music at
[28:56] message weddings and birthday parties.
[28:59] You go sneaking around to cinemas. You
[29:01] play worldly music in your car. You talk
[29:04] about the movies and celebrities to your
[29:06] worldly friends and worldly church
[29:08] friends. This is happening here in
[29:10] Africa, saints.
[29:12] And yet you are the people condemning
[29:15] other churches who are quieter.
[29:18] But in your church, you're the rowdiest,
[29:20] loudest people full of emotions. But you
[29:24] do all of these things. The anointing
[29:26] you're supposed to have is the ability
[29:29] outside of church to keep you in the
[29:33] word.
[29:34] Right? That's what you ought to be
[29:36] teaching these young people.
[29:39] Or you have the spirit in church.
[29:42] Maybe you're not a young person. You're
[29:43] you're you're an older person. You have
[29:45] the spirit in church. But then after
[29:48] church, you go out and demonize your
[29:49] brothers, gossip about one another, tear
[29:52] one another down. This is not the
[29:54] anointing that is doing the purpose of
[29:56] God. We teach that seeking the Holy
[30:00] Ghost. This is what we teach.
[30:04] Seeking the Holy Ghost for the remedy of
[30:06] backslidiness is not according to the
[30:10] Bible and the word. If you are doing
[30:12] that, you have had the word. If if you
[30:17] as a young person are seeking the Holy
[30:20] Ghost to get rid of backslideness and
[30:23] unrighteousness, you have had the word
[30:26] misrepresented to you. Someone has been
[30:28] lying to you. It's not true. The Holy
[30:31] Ghost, this is what we teach, is a
[30:35] nature of purpose from God.
[30:38] It's not a fix all shortcut for you
[30:42] after you've lived an unrighteous life
[30:44] for God has suddenly gave you this
[30:46] power. Click it and it's gone. No sir,
[30:49] that's false. Somebody's been telling
[30:52] you that. They've been lying to you. The
[30:54] Lord Jesus said to the woman in the
[30:56] street, "I don't condemn you. That means
[30:58] I've forgiven you. Go and sin no more."
[31:03] That means there is no fix all. That
[31:06] means after you've been forgiven, you
[31:08] have a responsibility to yourself to
[31:11] live righteous after your sins of the
[31:14] past have already been forgiven. Okay,
[31:19] let's go to
[31:21] uh
[31:23] accusation number two.
[31:28] So number two
[31:30] they are saying we teach that
[31:34] uh acts chapter 2 experience the acts
[31:36] chapter 2 experience is not the
[31:39] indwelling
[31:40] okay
[31:42] once again this is false
[31:46] that's not what we teach we teach that
[31:51] you trying to replicate Acts chapter 2
[31:54] Today in a day that is completely
[31:58] different and forcing an anointing
[32:02] on people and deluding the people
[32:06] uh and just claiming it that that
[32:09] manifestation and experience they had is
[32:11] the indwelling. That's wrong. That's
[32:14] what we are teaching. You trying to
[32:17] replicate Acts chapter 2 from 2,000
[32:19] years ago.
[32:21] That's wrong. and trying to teach them
[32:24] that that is the anointing, that is the
[32:26] the remedy, the fix all, and that is the
[32:29] indwelling. That is not go read the
[32:31] quotes. Brother Baron said they received
[32:33] the fullness of the spirit in Pentecost.
[32:36] They already received it uh Isuza Street
[32:40] and now we're moving into bringing sons
[32:42] in. They've already done that. He didn't
[32:45] he didn't even speak about message
[32:47] people. just he he's he was speaking of
[32:49] the age of Leodysia and he said they
[32:51] already received it. They've been
[32:52] preaching it already received the
[32:54] fullness of the spirit. They've had that
[32:57] and yet they did not accept the
[32:59] prophet's message. They rejected him
[33:01] completely
[33:03] the indwelling. What is it? Right? those
[33:06] in Acts chapter 2. Let's examine those
[33:08] in Acts chapter 2 because this is what
[33:10] they're teaching today in the message
[33:13] that receiving the fullness of the Holy
[33:15] Ghost according to Acts chapter 2,
[33:18] right? Those people in Acts two receive
[33:22] the fullness of the of the spirit
[33:24] according to the measure of the word for
[33:27] their day. And then watch what happens.
[33:31] They go out from the upper room. It it's
[33:35] not even like five minutes. They have
[33:37] problems with each other's teachings.
[33:39] They have problems with Paul's teachings
[33:40] and disagreements. When I say five
[33:42] minutes, I I mean it metaphorically. I
[33:45] mean it within such a short space of
[33:47] time. They already start uh disagreeing
[33:50] on the word and and Paul's teachings
[33:52] they Peter says we wrestle we have a we
[33:56] have a a difficulty understanding the
[33:58] things brother Paul is teaching. Then
[34:00] they have disagreements among one
[34:02] another with public blowout, public
[34:06] arguments among the brothers that then
[34:08] causes them to even separate. Now you
[34:11] tell me, how do they go from being in
[34:14] one accord in the upper room to
[34:16] separation based on the revelation of
[34:18] the word if the complete evidence was
[34:22] the indwelling of Acts chapter 2? If
[34:25] they had the complete indwelling in Acts
[34:28] chapter 2, how do they then separate
[34:30] based on the word? This is a problem,
[34:34] right? And they they had bad blowouts.
[34:37] They literally had Paul telling them,
[34:40] "You are doing something wrong.
[34:42] Segregating Jews and Gentiles and
[34:44] teaching them the natural circumcision
[34:46] and making these people sit on this side
[34:48] and do sit on this side because of
[34:51] Jewish tradition." And then a massive
[34:54] blowout and they separated literally
[34:56] where James is speaking of justification
[34:59] by works and Paul is preaching
[35:01] justification by faith.
[35:04] Right?
[35:06] How do they go from being of one accord
[35:08] to separation? So this is what is being
[35:11] purported now that if you have an Acts
[35:15] chapter 2 experience or manifestation
[35:18] that is also the inddwelling that is not
[35:21] scriptural right here's the number one
[35:23] problem with deluding yourself. So again
[35:28] I'm saying to you we are not teaching
[35:31] that Acts chapter 2 was not the
[35:33] indwelling. Of course, they had the
[35:35] indwelling of the spirit based on the
[35:38] measure of word for their day. Right?
[35:42] Then you have Paul coming and saying in
[35:44] in uh in in 1 Corinthians 13, when I was
[35:48] a child, I spake as a child. I acted
[35:50] like a child, but when I became a man, I
[35:52] put away childish things. Right? And the
[35:56] other scripture that says when that
[35:57] which is perfect is come, then that
[35:59] which is in part is done away with.
[36:01] There's so much in there. And of course,
[36:04] the others may not have agreed with Paul
[36:06] on these things.
[36:10] Here's the number one problem with
[36:12] deliluding yourself into thinking you
[36:14] can replicate the book of Acts. Here's
[36:17] the problem. And we've seen it here in
[36:19] Africa. Anyone can fake that. [laughter]
[36:23] We have people here who believe they
[36:25] brought the Holy Ghost to Africa. We
[36:27] have people who churches here where uh
[36:31] you you will not see manifestations or
[36:34] church anointing or atmosphere like
[36:36] anywhere else in the world. You will not
[36:38] see it. We've got noise here the loudest
[36:40] that you you never going to see in any
[36:42] message church anywhere in the world. We
[36:45] have that here. We see it here. And we
[36:48] also see the evidence and the fruits. If
[36:50] you shout that loud, jump that high and
[36:54] uh and preach that that way, you better
[36:57] make sure you produce the fruits that
[36:59] your house is in order, that your
[37:01] children are living the life, that your
[37:03] church is tying the uh uh uh living the
[37:07] life, keeping in in line with the word.
[37:10] If you have that expression, you better
[37:12] make sure that's happening because it's
[37:14] not by how how loud you shout that we
[37:16] know. It's by the fruits that we know
[37:18] them.
[37:19] That's what we're teaching, right?
[37:22] Here's the number one problem with
[37:24] deliluding yourself, right?
[37:26] And thinking that you can replicate the
[37:29] book of Acts. I'm saying it again.
[37:31] Anyone can fake that. And you are
[37:34] opening a way for the enemy, that is
[37:38] demonology, to get back into the church
[37:41] because that's not the evidence.
[37:45] Anything that can be faked, anything
[37:48] that can be copied, anything that a
[37:52] white horse rider can impersonate
[37:56] is going to be used by demonology
[37:59] to trap the church all over again.
[38:03] Saints, the indwelling comes from
[38:05] nothing else than the divine nature
[38:08] which comes from the word. Indwelling in
[38:11] a person by a person who believes the
[38:14] word for their day. Period.
[38:16] There is so much to be said on this and
[38:19] the measure is not your experience. But
[38:20] I'm going to get to that in a little
[38:22] while when we read the quote. Okay,
[38:26] let's go to um the third accusation.
[38:32] All right, this is incredible.
[38:34] So the third accusation is we teach
[38:38] psychology and then the brother even
[38:40] said when I preach in brother Duncan's
[38:42] church I gave I don't know nine steps
[38:46] nine steps and it was psychology and he
[38:48] even said it is junk. So we are we are
[38:52] teaching psychology nine steps of
[38:55] psychology and it is junk. Okay, there
[38:59] are more things that were said and I'm
[39:01] not I'm not going to focus on that. I I
[39:04] want to focus on what is being spoken
[39:06] about uh in terms of the word because we
[39:10] want to focus on the word, right? That's
[39:12] what's more important than what people
[39:14] think or say.
[39:16] So, we teach psychology nine steps of I
[39:21] don't I don't know. It's almost as if
[39:24] when I ended the message on psych on on
[39:26] sexuality and I was telling the young
[39:28] people, this is what you need to do.
[39:32] Stop doing this and start doing that,
[39:34] right? And and I gave a few steps of
[39:38] this the correct solutions
[39:41] to overcoming sexual obsession.
[39:45] And I suppose because I mentioned these
[39:47] are steps that they assume this is
[39:50] psychology.
[39:52] And yet, if you go back and listen to
[39:54] what I preached, all I spoke about in
[39:56] the messages on sexuality was,
[39:59] confession,
[40:01] repentance, taking accountability for
[40:04] your wrongs, making it right, getting
[40:07] back to church, not isolating yourself
[40:09] in your bedroom, getting back to the
[40:11] word, not blaming others for your
[40:13] wrongs, finding a purpose and doing it,
[40:17] living for others and not yourself.
[40:21] I I don't understand. These are strong
[40:24] Christian principles that come right out
[40:27] of the book of Acts. This is what every
[40:30] person Christ forgave did to put their
[40:34] lives right. How is it psychology?
[40:38] These ministers either don't know what
[40:40] is psychology or they're just playing
[40:42] dumb for attention from their own
[40:44] people. I need I need I need a lot of
[40:46] help here. Okay.
[40:50] Now, I want to go back to the teaching
[40:52] that I I did at BCF, right? Honestly, I
[40:57] didn't get what the big deal was. It's
[41:00] not like these ministers didn't want to
[41:02] understand what I taught or what I said.
[41:07] Many of them know me and have heard how
[41:10] I preach. They know I didn't go there to
[41:13] lead people away from the prophet.
[41:18] I read quotes of the prophet in every
[41:20] service I preach. If anything, if
[41:23] someone else hears me from the outside
[41:25] would say I read too much of the
[41:27] prophet. Everybody who hears me preach
[41:29] knows this is how I preach. I was not
[41:32] trying in any way to make people
[41:34] disbelieve the prophet. If anything,
[41:37] they should have known I was trying to
[41:39] get the young people back to believing
[41:41] and understanding what the prophet
[41:43] meant. Right? And and if they listen to
[41:46] what I preached in that message, that's
[41:48] how I introduced the subject, right? To
[41:52] go on pulpits and act as if I didn't
[41:56] know there is a scripture that says the
[41:59] Old Testament saints were moved of the
[42:01] Holy Ghost to write the scriptures. The
[42:03] most famous scripture of all. I mean, we
[42:07] all know that that's quoted by people
[42:08] who fight against atheists. And
[42:11] everybody knows what are you assuming
[42:14] that I didn't know the scripture which I
[42:18] even mentioned in the message right to
[42:21] go on your pulpits and to say to quote
[42:24] the scripture as if gotcha
[42:27] that was just being cute disingenuous
[42:30] and performative. So let me break it
[42:33] down for you one last time.
[42:36] If you go back and listen to everything
[42:38] I preached at BCF,
[42:40] right, listen to what I said, right, and
[42:46] uh or even ask me for my notes, which I
[42:49] will gladly supply. I've done it for
[42:50] people over the years, you will see that
[42:53] I was simply pointing out that the
[42:56] translators of the Bible were making a
[42:59] distinction in the manifestation of the
[43:02] Holy Spirit over the different ages.
[43:05] first thing. Secondly, they chose to
[43:08] make the distinct the distinction
[43:11] between the anointing that was upon Old
[43:14] Testament saints as compared to the
[43:16] anointing that came in after Acts
[43:19] chapter 2. You literally have a
[43:22] scripture that said the Holy Ghost had
[43:24] not yet been given.
[43:26] Right? This is what I'm doing. This is
[43:28] what I I'm trying to put this together
[43:30] for the young people to understand the
[43:32] difference between the Holy Ghost
[43:34] anointing after Christ and that which
[43:37] was before Christ. I literally went
[43:40] through the difference in
[43:41] manifestations. That's what we're trying
[43:43] to do. And all I was saying was the
[43:45] English translators chose to make a
[43:48] distinction. Not me. It's there in the
[43:51] Bible. Right?
[43:54] And so there's places throughout the
[43:57] scripture where the English translators
[43:59] used two different words though it was
[44:02] the same in Greek and Hebrew.
[44:05] They chose to use two different words.
[44:07] But for an example,
[44:09] the English translators did not write
[44:12] that I I spoke about this recently that
[44:15] John was in the spirit. John was in the
[44:18] ghost on the Lord's day. It's the same
[44:20] Greek word. It's numa, right? Why will
[44:23] they not say John was in the ghost on
[44:25] the Lord's day? Why would they say John
[44:28] was in the spirit on the Lord's day?
[44:30] Because context is important. Though it
[44:34] is the same Greek word numer, it does
[44:37] not make sense to say that John was in
[44:39] the ghost on the Lord's day. In many
[44:42] places though, it is the same Greek word
[44:45] numer p neu m a. They knew that you
[44:49] cannot use the word ghost uh in some
[44:52] places and in some places you should use
[44:54] the word spirit. So I only spoke about
[44:58] the words holy ghost and holy spirit. I
[45:01] did not even get to the phrases where it
[45:03] says spirit of god or uh um spirit of
[45:08] the lord or the lord spirit or the just
[45:10] the word spirit. I didn't even go to all
[45:13] those places to show you the wonderful
[45:15] differences um that the translators uh
[45:19] chose to use those words to express the
[45:22] correct expression.
[45:25] But that was only half, right? That was
[45:29] the foundation that I was using in that
[45:32] message for showing that there was a
[45:35] distinction that brother Brandham was
[45:37] pointing to. Right? The distinction was
[45:41] between the anointing and the person.
[45:44] That's what they were showing. And
[45:46] brother Brandham uses the words Holy
[45:48] Ghost, Holy Spirit interchangeably. I
[45:50] said that. But he introduced he, Brother
[45:54] Brandham introduced something new. He
[45:56] created a problem that the Bible
[46:00] translators did not create. Brother
[46:02] Brandham created a new problem. It's not
[46:05] a problem for those who have the right
[46:06] interpretation and who have the
[46:08] revelation. But he introduced something
[46:10] that's not even in the Bible. He said
[46:13] there is a difference between the
[46:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the person
[46:18] of the Holy Ghost. He was doing exactly
[46:20] what the translators did. They were
[46:23] showing a difference between somebody
[46:25] who has the indwelling and someone who
[46:28] has an anointing upon them.
[46:31] That's all I was trying to say. I was
[46:33] pointing to the distinction he made. Why
[46:36] was I doing that? To explain to the
[46:38] youth what he meant by you can have the
[46:41] Holy Ghost 24 hours in a day and still
[46:44] go to hell. Now, this happened to tie in
[46:47] with the trip, the entire trip, because
[46:50] this is exactly one of the quotes why
[46:53] you can speak to whether the Holy Ghost
[46:57] is a remedy for sexuality,
[47:02] right? You can have the Holy Ghost 24
[47:04] hours in a day and still go to hell.
[47:06] What did he mean? Did he mean the
[47:08] indwelling or the anointing?
[47:11] Excuse me.
[47:13] This is what I was talking about
[47:15] brothers. What is the problem? Right?
[47:19] And by that he meant you can have the
[47:22] anointing 24 hours in a day and go to
[47:24] hell. Now you can't tell this to
[47:27] denominational people.
[47:29] They'll have a heart attack. You you
[47:32] could not live with the person
[47:35] indwelling you 24 hours in a day and
[47:38] still go to hell. No, that's not it. You
[47:40] can't you can't have that and go to
[47:42] hell, right? But you can't have the
[47:44] anointing and go to hell. That's all
[47:47] through the scriptures. The rain falls
[47:49] in the just and the unjust.
[47:52] Everybody knows that. So also, brother
[47:55] Brandham speaks about Ephesians 4 where
[47:57] he says, "You are sealed with the Holy
[48:00] Spirit of promise till the day of your
[48:01] redemption." And he speaks about the box
[48:03] car.
[48:05] Look at the difference, right? There's a
[48:07] seal placed on the box car. And when it
[48:09] reaches the end of the journey, the
[48:11] owner of the seal breaks the seal and
[48:14] redeems what is his. So what are you
[48:17] sealed with? These are the things that
[48:18] the young people are asking. What are
[48:20] you sealed with till the day of your
[48:22] redemption? The anointing or the
[48:25] indwelling.
[48:27] To those who who say the anointing and
[48:30] the indwelling is the same, you have a
[48:32] problem.
[48:35] That's what I was trying to explain to
[48:36] the young people because the way it has
[48:39] been taught has been confusing to them.
[48:41] I did not choose to come in to speak
[48:44] something controversial. These ministers
[48:46] know that my purpose was speak was in
[48:49] speaking on this was to reduce the
[48:51] confusion and to show them what they
[48:53] should look for the young people what
[48:55] they should look for when desiring the
[48:57] Holy Ghost. Instead, these ministers by
[49:01] making an elaborate drama of what I
[49:03] preached and trying to correct me by
[49:05] saying I didn't say what the prophet
[49:07] said and then now set back they set back
[49:10] the work that we have actually been
[49:12] doing to get the people back to
[49:15] believing and trusting in the prophet
[49:18] and what he said. It's so sad truly.
[49:23] But I want to say this. Apart from the
[49:25] few that took umbrage to what I said,
[49:28] there are thousands of people who said
[49:30] they understood perfectly what I was
[49:32] saying and that there's no controversy.
[49:35] I guess then that I have had a
[49:38] resounding amen from the bride of
[49:39] Christ, which is all that matters in the
[49:42] end.
[49:44] Again, I don't want to go through
[49:46] explaining it all over again. I just
[49:48] want to point out one simple thing for
[49:51] those who would have uh wanted to be
[49:55] technical.
[49:56] I was driving the point that the
[49:59] solution to unrighteousness
[50:02] is purpose in the word and not
[50:05] atmosphere in the church or even the
[50:09] experience of salvation and the new
[50:12] birth. That is not it. Of course, you
[50:14] got to have an experience. Of course,
[50:16] you got to have a new birth, but that's
[50:19] not the solution for unrighteous living
[50:21] and backslideness,
[50:23] right? The Holy Ghost must produce
[50:27] purpose in you. And this is my problem.
[50:30] This is what I've been seeing. I've
[50:32] lived in this message my entire life.
[50:36] And I'm telling you, I know what works
[50:39] and what doesn't work. If you bring
[50:42] young people into this message, you take
[50:45] them to church, you fire at them,
[50:49] charisma, atmosphere,
[50:52] church music, shouting, screaming, and
[50:55] all they do is come to church, sit down,
[50:57] and do nothing for their lives, for
[51:00] their teenage years. They do nothing.
[51:02] Not every young person gets to play in
[51:05] the band. Not every young person gets to
[51:08] uh uh do something or have some kind of
[51:11] purpose in the church on Sundays, right?
[51:16] This is the culture that's become
[51:18] message churches is your young people
[51:21] come to church and not even the young
[51:23] people, everybody else. It's a it's a
[51:25] one-man show. It's a or a few men show,
[51:28] pastors and a few preachers and those
[51:30] who have offices in the church. The rest
[51:32] of the people come to church, sit down,
[51:35] pay their tithes, and do nothing. They
[51:38] literally do nothing. And you're told,
[51:40] "Your purpose is, well, you know, as a
[51:43] sister, you must be a wife. You must uh
[51:48] you must cook the food, iron the
[51:49] clothes, wash the clothes, bring up the
[51:51] children, and that is brilliant. No
[51:55] issue with that.
[51:57] But you cannot talk about the word. You
[52:00] cannot testify to people anymore. Where
[52:03] the book of Acts is full of young
[52:04] ladies, young women, married women
[52:06] testifying to people, talking to
[52:09] unbelievers, talking to the neighbors,
[52:11] spreading the gospel. Nope. You're not
[52:13] allowed to do that anymore. Why? It's
[52:16] not your place. Young people, brothers
[52:19] in the church, maybe they done something
[52:21] wrong, they committed adultery, they
[52:22] come back, repented. You cannot talk.
[52:25] You cannot speak the word anywhere. You
[52:27] cannot testify. It's not your place. You
[52:30] can't do anything without the pastor.
[52:31] You can't do anything. This is what
[52:33] we've got in churches. We've got people
[52:35] who sit down and do nothing. They have
[52:38] no purpose. And though you have the new
[52:41] birth and you had an experience of the
[52:43] new birth and then you come out and you
[52:46] don't know what the Holy Ghost is, the
[52:48] Holy Ghost is the spirit of purpose.
[52:52] It's it's supposed to give you a zeal to
[52:56] do something with what God reveals to
[52:58] you. And if you're sitting sitting
[53:00] around doing nothing, you descend into
[53:03] unrighteousness, complacency,
[53:06] laziness, and eventually immorality.
[53:09] That's where you become disillusioned.
[53:11] That's the problem we have in the church
[53:14] worldwide,
[53:16] except in denominational churches. They
[53:19] seem to be a lot more doers than sayers.
[53:23] This is a problem. All right. I want to
[53:27] share another quote with you
[53:30] or rather our first quote
[53:36] from the message the queen of Sheba
[53:39] when the life that was in the animal
[53:42] died. So now I want to I want to bring
[53:44] you to this point on the holy ghost and
[53:45] the holy spirit right the old and new
[53:47] testament saints.
[53:50] So speaking of the Old Testament, the
[53:52] life that was in the animal that died,
[53:54] the life that could not that life could
[53:56] not come back and be a spirit with a
[53:58] human being because it was an animal
[54:00] life without a soul. But when Jesus
[54:03] died, it was a soul of God. And when the
[54:07] cell, he means the blood cell was broke,
[54:11] it sanctified a church that the Holy
[54:14] Spirit could live in us who were
[54:17] sexualborn. Then it's God above us, God
[54:21] with us. Now it's God in us. Okay?
[54:27] Now this this is this to me what is
[54:29] surprising.
[54:31] Anybody in the message who who read the
[54:34] token message knows that the prophet
[54:36] said the token is the Holy Ghost and the
[54:41] blood cell only broke to come upon the
[54:44] believer after Christ.
[54:47] Now my question to those people who
[54:50] fired at me to say it's the same thing.
[54:53] It's the same thing
[54:55] because the people in the Old Testament
[54:57] were INSPIRED BY THE HOLY GHOST TO WRITE
[55:00] the scriptures. Now I want to ask you if
[55:04] the blood cell only broke after Christ,
[55:08] what did the Old Testament saints have?
[55:12] It is all over the message, brothers.
[55:14] When this revelation was made known to
[55:16] the prophet when he preached the token
[55:18] that the blood cell broke only after
[55:21] Christ that before Christ the Old
[55:23] Testament saints were anointed with the
[55:25] Holy Spirit but it was not the same
[55:27] manifestation because the blood that was
[55:30] offered for them was animal life which
[55:33] could not come back upon the believer.
[55:36] How hard is this to understand?
[55:38] So we know what brother Brandham said in
[55:41] those two quotes where he said they are
[55:43] the selfsame word. Why? Because he was
[55:47] addressing something the denominations
[55:49] were doing in brother Brandham's time.
[55:51] The denominations who were non-
[55:53] Pentecostals were using the term Holy
[55:56] Spirit and Holy Ghost to discriminate
[55:59] against the Pentecostals.
[56:01] Right? That's what they were doing.
[56:04] We're using as a form of discrimination
[56:05] to say these Pentecostals have the Holy
[56:07] Ghost. We are the Holy Spirit. We
[56:10] understand what brother Vanam was
[56:11] answering. There is no mystery there. We
[56:14] all know why that is irrelevant to the
[56:17] discussion we were having.
[56:22] The discussion we are having is not
[56:24] about the words. It's about the
[56:25] manifestation of the anointing versus
[56:29] the life produced by the inddwelling.
[56:33] Now everything that I taught at BCF was
[56:36] well thought out, well researched in the
[56:39] message and the Bible and spoken with
[56:41] what little time we had, expecting the
[56:44] maturity of people globally to be where
[56:47] it should be and that is at the level of
[56:49] mature sons and not juvenile pettiness.
[56:53] So I'm going to read a lengthy passage
[56:56] of quotes so we hear what the prophet
[57:00] says about this and then answer some
[57:03] questions from the young people that I
[57:05] have received.
[57:07] Okay. So let's let's go to
[57:12] uh the quotes and this is from the manan
[57:15] or rather Pamean church age and then
[57:17] also the SMan uh church age.
[57:21] All right. Are you ready for this
[57:23] church?
[57:24] Perameanian church, page 169, paragraph
[57:27] 2.
[57:28] And there it is. Now, I don't want to do
[57:31] too much of preaching on this. I want to
[57:33] read you the quotes and you decide for
[57:36] yourself. Right there it is. He says,
[57:40] "You can't claim that manifestation is
[57:44] the evidence of being spirit or
[57:47] spiritfilled."
[57:49] No sir.
[57:51] So this is what I'm saying to you. I
[57:53] have a problem with you replicating
[57:56] trying to replicate the book of Acts and
[57:59] telling young people that manifestation
[58:02] is the evidence of being spirit born.
[58:05] When the prophet says it's not listen no
[58:08] sir I will admit that true manifestation
[58:13] true manifestation is the evidence of
[58:15] the Holy Spirit doing mighty acts.
[58:18] That's the only evidence. It's the
[58:20] evidence of. So in other words, if you
[58:23] have a manifestation, you speak with
[58:24] tongues, you prophesy something or
[58:26] whatever, the only evidence that is is
[58:29] the evidence that the Holy Spirit is
[58:31] doing mighty acts. He says, but it is
[58:35] not the evidence of the individual being
[58:38] spiritfilled
[58:41] even though that individual has an
[58:43] abundance of those manifestations.
[58:47] Uh am I reading wrong? Am I am I not
[58:51] seeing this? Is brother Baron not saying
[58:55] that the anointing and the the the being
[59:00] spirit or rather um manifestation of the
[59:03] Holy Spirit doing mighty acts is not the
[59:07] same as indwelling. Is that what it's
[59:10] saying? Right. Are we on the right
[59:12] track? Are we reading the same message?
[59:16] Let's read on. Pergamanian church age.
[59:18] The evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[59:21] today is just the same as it was back in
[59:24] the day of our Lord. It is receiving the
[59:26] word of truth for the day in which you
[59:29] live. Jesus never did stress the
[59:32] importance of the works as he did the
[59:34] word. He knew that if people got the
[59:37] word, the works would follow. That is
[59:41] Bible. Okay. Let's go to Smy and church
[59:44] age page 143 paragraph 1. [snorts] Now
[59:47] when God is silent we had better be
[59:48] silent but where he has spoken we had
[59:50] better speak too and he and say what he
[59:53] has already said. All right are you
[59:55] ready for this? He told us the evidence
[59:59] or what would happen after being
[1:00:01] baptized with the Holy Ghost was that we
[1:00:05] would have the teacher come and teach
[1:00:08] all truth. What is the evidence after
[1:00:12] being baptized with the Holy Ghost is
[1:00:15] that you would have the teacher
[1:00:18] inside.
[1:00:19] That teacher was an inside teacher. I'm
[1:00:22] reading, not an outside teacher. If the
[1:00:26] spirit wasn't inside, you wouldn't hear
[1:00:30] the truth and receive it by revelation
[1:00:32] if you heard it every moment of the day.
[1:00:35] That means you can, this is why you can
[1:00:38] have the anointing 24 hours in a day and
[1:00:41] not have the inside teacher.
[1:00:44] Is this what the message is saying?
[1:00:47] That was the sign of the indwelling
[1:00:49] spirit in the days of Paul. What? What
[1:00:52] was the sign of the indwelling spirit in
[1:00:54] the days of Paul? Hearing the word,
[1:00:57] understanding the word, having the
[1:00:59] revelation of the word for your day.
[1:01:02] That is the sign of the indwelling.
[1:01:05] saints. I I I don't know. I just I don't
[1:01:08] even know if I'm reading the same
[1:01:09] message as my brothers. Honestly,
[1:01:13] those who are filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:15] heard the word received it and lived by
[1:01:19] it. Those who did not have the spirit
[1:01:23] heard it only as carnal men, but a wrong
[1:01:26] interpretation in it on it and went into
[1:01:29] sin. There it is.
[1:01:32] Paragraph two. in every age and every
[1:01:36] age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:01:39] true believer. So here's the other thing
[1:01:41] we hear about the age of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:43] was the first age and the last age.
[1:01:46] Brother man said every age was the age
[1:01:48] of the Holy Ghost for the true believer.
[1:01:51] I say in he says I say in every age the
[1:01:55] evidence was the same. Those who had the
[1:01:58] spirit, the teacher,
[1:02:00] the teacher
[1:02:02] heard the word and that spirit in them
[1:02:06] took the word and taught it. Re
[1:02:10] praise be to God. That spirit in them
[1:02:14] took the word and taught it to them
[1:02:18] in brackets revealed it.
[1:02:21] and they were of the group that heard
[1:02:23] the messenger and his message and took
[1:02:25] it and lived it.
[1:02:28] Let's go on. Paragraph three. I know it
[1:02:31] is a great temptation to refer back to
[1:02:33] the day of Pentecost. There it is. I
[1:02:36] know it is a great temptation to refer
[1:02:38] back to the day of Pentecost and also to
[1:02:41] the day when the Holy Ghost fell in the
[1:02:43] house of Cornelius and then set those
[1:02:45] two identical experiences as the
[1:02:49] evidence of the baptism with the Holy
[1:02:51] Ghost. But on each occasion, the tongues
[1:02:54] were understood by the listeners. This
[1:02:58] is a far cry from the modern babble of
[1:03:00] confusion of Pentecostal meetings.
[1:03:03] Saints, I've been preaching this message
[1:03:05] this way from the very beginning. I have
[1:03:08] not changed it. It's what the prophet
[1:03:10] said. And if this were not enough to
[1:03:13] persuade us to leave off such reasoning,
[1:03:16] what will we do when we are confronted
[1:03:18] with the fact that people who have never
[1:03:21] spoken in tongues have some of the other
[1:03:24] eight manifestations in their lives such
[1:03:27] as word of wisdom, the discerning of
[1:03:29] spirits, a word of knowledge, faith,
[1:03:32] healing, and even miracles. And this
[1:03:35] observation is even more interesting in
[1:03:37] the light that tones is the least of the
[1:03:40] nine gifts. So when we see people who do
[1:03:43] not nor ever have spoken in tongues use
[1:03:47] greater gifts than those who do speak in
[1:03:49] tonesues, we must discount such a
[1:03:52] doctrine even more completely than
[1:03:54] before.
[1:03:58] Man, this is the prophet. So you can see
[1:04:01] now. So, so I'm saying we've got people,
[1:04:03] brothers in the message who are only
[1:04:05] pushing those things, dreams, visions,
[1:04:08] speaking in tongues, prophesying,
[1:04:10] shouting and screaming. What about
[1:04:12] wisdom? What about knowledge? Brother
[1:04:14] Barry, here's a quote saying those are
[1:04:15] the higher gifts. What about those?
[1:04:18] These people who have wisdom and
[1:04:19] knowledge, they're not going to shout.
[1:04:20] They're not going to scream. They're not
[1:04:22] going to speak with tongues, prophesy,
[1:04:24] run around, jump around, slay in the
[1:04:26] spirit. They're not doing all Why are
[1:04:28] you trying to revive something from
[1:04:31] yesterday year? That's our question. And
[1:04:34] deliluding the young people to think
[1:04:36] they must comply with that. So you can
[1:04:39] see now I'm reading paragraph page 144
[1:04:42] paragraph 1. You can see now that we
[1:04:45] cannot afford to say what the Bible has
[1:04:48] not said. When scripture teaches us that
[1:04:51] the work of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:04:53] manifestation of that blessed person is
[1:04:57] to bring the truth of each age to the
[1:05:01] true seed of that age. Then we know that
[1:05:05] the spirit has to be abiding in the
[1:05:08] person or he cannot receive the truth
[1:05:11] for that time.
[1:05:14] That means that's why I was teaching at
[1:05:16] BCF the purposeful nature.
[1:05:20] You've got to have the person on the
[1:05:22] inside and the evidence is going to be
[1:05:25] that you are going to learn the word and
[1:05:28] receive the full revelation of the open
[1:05:30] book. This is the issue today. We have a
[1:05:33] whole lot of people shouting open book,
[1:05:35] open book, open book just for the sake
[1:05:37] of shouting out open book. But they
[1:05:40] don't have it.
[1:05:42] What? It's not enough to say the seals
[1:05:44] are open. The seventh seal is open and
[1:05:46] then go back to Pentecostalism.
[1:05:50] I'm sorry. That's the truth.
[1:05:53] Amen. That is exactly correct. The
[1:05:55] prophet says, "And if these ages bring
[1:05:57] out anything, they surely bring out and
[1:05:59] bear out this truth." Simony and
[1:06:02] churches 144 paragraph 2. Now before we
[1:06:05] leave this subject, prophet is saying I
[1:06:07] want to make myself very clear on what
[1:06:10] the baptism with the Holy Ghost is
[1:06:12] according to the word. Are you
[1:06:14] listening? Are you hearing? Listen to
[1:06:17] what he says. It is not according to me.
[1:06:20] It is not according to you. It has to be
[1:06:23] according to thus sayeth the Lord or we
[1:06:25] are falsely led. Amen. Can you say amen
[1:06:29] to that? Is that what the prophet is
[1:06:31] saying? Before he leaves the subject, he
[1:06:33] wants to make very clear what the
[1:06:35] baptism with the Holy Ghost is according
[1:06:37] to the word. Are you ready for this?
[1:06:40] Okay.
[1:06:42] To begin with, he says, paragraph 3, you
[1:06:45] will notice that in my meetings, when I
[1:06:48] have finished preaching an evangelistic
[1:06:50] service or some teaching message, I cast
[1:06:54] the net and invite a response from the
[1:06:57] people. I asked them to come forward and
[1:07:01] receive the Holy Spirit.
[1:07:04] My Pentecostal friends upon hearing me
[1:07:08] say this believe that I'm inviting
[1:07:11] people to come forward to be baptized
[1:07:13] with the Holy Ghost because they are
[1:07:16] already born again. So when I invite
[1:07:19] those who are spiritfilled to come and
[1:07:22] deal with those who have answered the
[1:07:24] invitation to receive the spirit, these
[1:07:28] dear ones surge forward and deal with
[1:07:31] the people in such a manner as to
[1:07:34] encourage them to yield to God and
[1:07:36] believe to speak in tongues.
[1:07:39] This has caused a great deal of
[1:07:41] confusion. And I want to tell you
[1:07:44] exactly what I mean. I mean for a sinner
[1:07:48] to [clears throat] come forward and be
[1:07:50] born again, which is to be baptized into
[1:07:53] the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost,
[1:07:56] which is exactly what took place at
[1:07:58] Pentecost when the church was launched.
[1:08:02] In other words, to be born of the spirit
[1:08:05] is to be truly baptized with the Holy
[1:08:07] Ghost. It is one and the same.
[1:08:10] Now I realize I'm still reading that it
[1:08:13] is going to be confusing for a moment
[1:08:15] here as most people know that I was
[1:08:19] ordained a Baptist preacher and I have
[1:08:22] steadfastly declared that the Baptist
[1:08:24] have missed it for saying you receive
[1:08:26] the Holy Ghost when you believe for that
[1:08:29] is not so. You receive him since you
[1:08:31] believe. He reads Acts chapter 19 2-6.
[1:08:36] Then he says now here is my point. Too
[1:08:39] many of you of our modernists and even
[1:08:43] our fundamentalists
[1:08:45] socalled
[1:08:46] believe unto salvation at a certain
[1:08:49] specific time which in many cases is
[1:08:52] called making a decision and that has
[1:08:55] been called receiving Christ or being
[1:08:58] born again. Now to receive Christ is to
[1:09:01] receive his spirit. To receive his
[1:09:03] spirit is to be born again. To receive
[1:09:06] his spirit is to be baptized with the
[1:09:08] Holy Ghost. Amen. These folks believe.
[1:09:12] That is wonderful. But they stop there.
[1:09:16] You receive the Holy Ghost after you
[1:09:19] believe. The prophet says it has always
[1:09:22] been that way and always will be. The
[1:09:25] very first word of direction to the
[1:09:27] people was by Peter at Pentecost. And he
[1:09:29] reads Acts 2: 38 and 39.
[1:09:33] Okay. Simony churches, we're almost
[1:09:36] done. Paragraph 145, um, paragraph 1.
[1:09:42] These directions came as a direct answer
[1:09:44] from Peter relative to what had actually
[1:09:48] happened at Pentecost. What came to pass
[1:09:51] was that God, according to Joel, was
[1:09:54] pouring out the promised Holy Spirit
[1:09:56] upon all flesh. He was not poured out
[1:10:00] before that time
[1:10:02] or given before that time. Are you
[1:10:06] listening?
[1:10:08] Those that were quoting that scripture
[1:10:09] back at me that the Holy Ghost was upon
[1:10:12] the Old Testament saints because they
[1:10:14] were moved by the Holy Ghost to write
[1:10:16] the scriptures. I know that. THAT'S NOT
[1:10:18] WHAT we were talking about. Right here
[1:10:21] is the prophet saying he was not poured
[1:10:24] out before that time or given before
[1:10:26] that time that this was it. But this was
[1:10:30] to come from now on by repenting being
[1:10:34] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:36] Christ and then God was duty bound to
[1:10:39] fill the ones who came. Peter or any of
[1:10:42] the apostles never said you must be born
[1:10:45] again and then filled with the Holy Spir
[1:10:47] with the spirit.
[1:10:49] Paragraph one
[1:10:52] this that this is the pattern of
[1:10:53] experience relative to receiving the
[1:10:55] Holy Spirit. Note carefully that the
[1:10:57] very next time the spirit fell upon
[1:10:59] people, Acts 8:5-17, right? And he reads
[1:11:02] that according to verse 12, he says they
[1:11:06] believed the word.
[1:11:10] This is why it's all about the word,
[1:11:12] saints. They believed the word. They
[1:11:16] then baptized. They were then baptized
[1:11:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus. But
[1:11:20] according to verse 16, not in spite of
[1:11:23] all that, they still had not received
[1:11:26] the Holy Spirit.
[1:11:28] [laughter]
[1:11:30] It was only after believing and being
[1:11:32] baptized correctly that they received
[1:11:35] the Holy Ghost. That is the exact
[1:11:37] pattern as set forth by Peter in Acts
[1:11:39] 2:38. Reading on, another scripture that
[1:11:42] casts wondrous light on us is found in
[1:11:45] Galatians 3:3-14.
[1:11:48] Cursed is everyone that hangeth is
[1:11:49] anyone that hangeth on a tree that the
[1:11:52] blessing of Abram speaking of the
[1:11:54] blessing of Abraham might come on the
[1:11:56] Gentiles through Jesus Christ that in
[1:11:58] order that we might receive the promise
[1:12:00] of the spirit through faith. Now here
[1:12:02] brother Bram zeros in on the blessing of
[1:12:04] Abraham because this is what was spoken
[1:12:06] of in Pentecost. He says, "Now by no
[1:12:10] means can it be said that the blessing
[1:12:13] of Abraham Abraham is the rebirth and
[1:12:16] that the promise of the spirit is the
[1:12:19] baptism with the Holy Ghost as two
[1:12:21] separate events. For the scripture,
[1:12:24] they're not events. Don't look at this
[1:12:26] as events, right? For the scripture
[1:12:28] reads, thus Jesus died on the cross and
[1:12:31] by means of that death and resurrection,
[1:12:34] the blessing of Abram came on the
[1:12:36] Gentiles, leaving the Jews. This
[1:12:38] transpired in order that the spirit
[1:12:40] might become available to the Gentiles.
[1:12:44] Okay,
[1:12:46] two more quotes from this man church age
[1:12:49] and we'll go to the next phase.
[1:12:53] To understand what I've just said is to
[1:12:56] clear up why students have never found
[1:12:58] Paul saying at any time be born again
[1:13:02] and then be spiritfilled. So
[1:13:05] you might be listening to me reading all
[1:13:07] this and saying, "Brother Ellison, now
[1:13:08] I'm getting confused." My point is when
[1:13:12] you tell young people that the anointing
[1:13:16] that comes on them
[1:13:19] is being spiritfilled,
[1:13:22] you are telling them something. You are
[1:13:24] not giving them the right experience.
[1:13:26] Right? They must be Don't even look at
[1:13:29] it as two separate events. I get that. I
[1:13:32] understand that you ought to be telling
[1:13:34] them what the true baptism of the Holy
[1:13:37] Ghost is. It's not that anointing in the
[1:13:40] church. It's not that experience in the
[1:13:43] church. It's a spirit of purpose.
[1:13:48] It must anoint them with ability. With
[1:13:51] purpose. And the only ability you are
[1:13:54] telling them is
[1:13:56] shouting, screaming, emotions in church.
[1:13:59] That is not ability.
[1:14:02] That is just praise and worship. I'm
[1:14:04] sorry. That's the truth. That's been
[1:14:08] lying to these young people. And that is
[1:14:10] the reason why so many are being deluded
[1:14:13] and now being discouraged in the
[1:14:14] message.
[1:14:17] They have inferredities there. They have
[1:14:19] put their own meanings to it to make it
[1:14:21] say, but scripture does not say that.
[1:14:23] Jesus never said it either. Look at John
[1:14:25] 7:37-39 and read it now with
[1:14:27] understanding.
[1:14:29] Okay, here it is.
[1:14:32] What is it that caused this
[1:14:34] misunderstanding? Here's the conclusion
[1:14:36] of it, saints. The answer is experience.
[1:14:41] We have gone by experience and not the
[1:14:44] word. Now, I I can remember this from
[1:14:45] the time I'm a child with every minister
[1:14:48] saying, "You got to have an experience.
[1:14:50] You got to have an experience." As if
[1:14:52] that's the answer to everything. You're
[1:14:55] never going to have this without an
[1:14:56] experience. Listen, I preach that, too.
[1:14:58] You have to have an experience. But the
[1:15:01] experience that you have is not the
[1:15:04] answer to unrighteous living. This is
[1:15:08] the thing. Why are you having this
[1:15:10] experience? Right now watch what brother
[1:15:12] M says. We have gone by experience and
[1:15:16] not the word.
[1:15:19] Listen [clears throat] to this.
[1:15:21] Away with experience as your measuring
[1:15:24] line. There is only one plum line. only
[1:15:28] one rod and that is the word.
[1:15:31] So we've been measuring people with
[1:15:35] experience. It's like forever, you know,
[1:15:38] my child goes to the altar in church and
[1:15:40] has an experience, has a crying moment
[1:15:43] and a they're feeling bad for something
[1:15:45] they did that is wrong. They're crying
[1:15:47] before God. That's good. They're
[1:15:49] repenting in their hearts. That's good.
[1:15:51] and you come back and then you go and
[1:15:54] blast it across and send WhatsApps to
[1:15:56] people and my child hasn't experienced
[1:15:58] they received the Holy Ghost. they were
[1:15:59] crying at the altar and you're now
[1:16:02] taking a personal moment that your child
[1:16:04] has been having and now uh advertising
[1:16:09] it to other people and telling them you
[1:16:12] know this God has done something with my
[1:16:14] child and then like 6 months later your
[1:16:16] child is backsliden right brother saying
[1:16:20] away with experience as your measuring
[1:16:23] line there is only one plum line only
[1:16:27] one rod and that is the word. Now watch
[1:16:30] carefully. Get this. He says, "Peter
[1:16:32] said, "Repent and be baptized in the
[1:16:34] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:16:35] of your sins, and you shall receive the
[1:16:36] gift of the Holy Ghost." Paul said,
[1:16:38] "Have you received the Holy Ghost since
[1:16:40] you believed?" Parents, has your child
[1:16:43] believed?
[1:16:46] This is the whole of our problem.
[1:16:48] Brother Ram is saying right here. People
[1:16:50] repent of their sins. They get baptized
[1:16:52] in water, but they don't go on and
[1:16:55] receive the Holy Ghost. What does he
[1:16:57] mean? You feel sorry for your sins. You
[1:17:01] want remission of sins. You want
[1:17:03] salvation. You believe that Jesus Christ
[1:17:06] is God. You believe in the blood of
[1:17:07] Calvary.
[1:17:09] That's great. You have that experience.
[1:17:12] But then you don't believe the word for
[1:17:14] your day. If you don't believe the word
[1:17:17] for your day, you do not receive the
[1:17:20] Holy Ghost of promise for your day.
[1:17:26] You have to believe unto receiving the
[1:17:28] spirit. Believing on Jesus is the step.
[1:17:31] Listen, I know this. I I'm working with
[1:17:34] young people. AND I CAN TELL when they
[1:17:36] don't believe. They're listening to
[1:17:38] people at universities. They're still
[1:17:40] arguing about evolution and abortion and
[1:17:43] uh people's rights and racism and uh
[1:17:47] liberalism. And you children in the
[1:17:50] message questioning whether God exists
[1:17:53] or God doesn't exist. Questioning
[1:17:55] whether brother Bam is a true prophet or
[1:17:57] not or I mean all of these things
[1:18:01] happening
[1:18:02] and and they have experiences
[1:18:06] children in the message coming to church
[1:18:08] services bored out of their minds
[1:18:11] sitting in church. They're only
[1:18:13] attracted when a minister talks about
[1:18:15] something that interests them. that
[1:18:18] tickles their fancy.
[1:18:20] What is going on? And then you tell me
[1:18:23] they had an experience. You want them to
[1:18:26] have the Holy Ghost, but you want
[1:18:28] atmosphere. You want them jumping,
[1:18:30] shouting, running around, dancing,
[1:18:31] singing in front, but when they hear the
[1:18:34] word, they're bored out of their minds.
[1:18:36] How can you have the Holy Ghost and be
[1:18:39] bored with the word? Please tell me.
[1:18:42] Because you have to believe unto
[1:18:44] receiving the spirit. He says believing
[1:18:47] on Jesus is the step in the right
[1:18:48] direction which is towards the Holy
[1:18:50] Ghost. But the people stop there. They
[1:18:53] go as far as water and then stop. They
[1:18:56] believe and then stop. The Bible does
[1:18:58] not say that you receive that uh that
[1:19:01] you receive when you believe. It is have
[1:19:03] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:19:05] believe. The exact literal translation
[1:19:08] is did you having previously believe
[1:19:11] receive the Holy Ghost? The people
[1:19:12] believe then stop. Believe what? You
[1:19:15] believe Christ, you believe in the
[1:19:17] blood, you believe in Calvary. This is
[1:19:18] now this this thing
[1:19:21] people uh leave the message say, "No,
[1:19:24] no, we must take people back to Christ,
[1:19:26] back to Calvary." That's been done
[1:19:28] before hundreds of years and you end up
[1:19:31] with denominations and and Christians
[1:19:33] murdering Christians. What are you
[1:19:35] saying?
[1:19:36] You don't receive the Holy Ghost when
[1:19:38] you believe unto him. Having repented,
[1:19:41] you go on and receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:43] Brother Ram is saying the same thing
[1:19:44] over and over again, but he's not
[1:19:46] explaining. It's our duty as ministers
[1:19:48] to explain this. Do you see it? That is
[1:19:51] what is wrong with our fundamentalists.
[1:19:53] He says they have no power for they stop
[1:19:57] short of Pentecost. Amen. They don't
[1:20:00] have the real Pentecost. Paragraph one
[1:20:03] on page 148. This is the last quote here
[1:20:06] in this Monan church age. They are like,
[1:20:08] and he gives us an example, the children
[1:20:11] of Israel who came out of Egypt and
[1:20:12] stopped short of the promised land. Now
[1:20:14] those children of Israel left Egypt
[1:20:16] about 2 million strong. They all
[1:20:18] journeyed together, all saw the same
[1:20:20] miracles of God. All parttook of the
[1:20:22] same manner and water from the smitten
[1:20:24] rock. All followed the same cloud by day
[1:20:26] and the pillar of fire by night. Just
[1:20:27] like everybody else, following the cloud
[1:20:29] with the prophet, following the pillar
[1:20:31] of fire with the prophet. But only two
[1:20:34] reached the promised land. Only two were
[1:20:37] true or real believers. That is correct
[1:20:40] because the word tells us the rest died
[1:20:43] because of unbelief. Hey people, wake
[1:20:46] up. Everyone had experiences. Everyone
[1:20:50] had manifestations. Everyone saw the
[1:20:52] pillar of fire, pillar of cloud.
[1:20:54] Everyone had mana from heaven,
[1:20:56] everpresent water from the rock. But
[1:20:58] only two of the originals who came out
[1:21:00] of Egypt entered into the promised land.
[1:21:03] The rest died because of unbelief.
[1:21:06] Because of unbelief, because of not
[1:21:09] going on with the word, they could not
[1:21:12] enter in. Hebrews 30 uh 3:19. Then since
[1:21:15] that is so that only two entered when
[1:21:18] the rest were not true believers. What
[1:21:20] made the difference? Two stayed with the
[1:21:23] word. When the hearts of the 10 spies
[1:21:26] failed at Kdesh Panad, Joshua and Caleb
[1:21:28] did not stagger for they believe the
[1:21:30] word. We are more than able to take the
[1:21:32] land. They knew they could because God
[1:21:34] had said, "I have given you the land
[1:21:36] after all those Israelites saw of the
[1:21:38] power and goodness and deliverance of
[1:21:39] God which did not enter into rest which
[1:21:42] is a type of the Holy Ghost." So you can
[1:21:44] see right now that very few will ever
[1:21:47] believe all the way to receiving the
[1:21:50] spirit of God. There it is. Young
[1:21:53] people, you have to believe all the way
[1:21:56] to receiving the spirit of God. Not all
[1:21:59] the way to believing William Brandham is
[1:22:01] a prophet. Not all the way to believing
[1:22:04] Jesus Christ died 2,000 years ago and
[1:22:07] shed his blood. Not all the way to
[1:22:09] believe that there is a baptism of the
[1:22:11] HOLY GHOST. NOT ALL THE way to believe
[1:22:14] that you must shout, jump, say amen in
[1:22:16] church. Believe all the way in the word
[1:22:22] to receiving the spirit of God.
[1:22:25] All right.
[1:22:27] Before I close this uh sharing window, I
[1:22:30] want to read
[1:22:32] one more shocking quote to you. Okay,
[1:22:35] before I answer the questions, which
[1:22:37] will be quick,
[1:22:41] there is a man that can turn on the
[1:22:42] light. For those of you who haven't read
[1:22:44] this, this is going to shock you out of
[1:22:46] your boots. Okay. Paragraph 187.
[1:22:51] I I've quoted this many times just
[1:22:53] off-handedly from the pulpit.
[1:22:56] No. Yes sir. The clean rags or the dirty
[1:22:59] rags of yesterday.
[1:23:02] When you read this, brother Maram is
[1:23:04] calling
[1:23:06] speaking in a way that can sound really
[1:23:08] offensive.
[1:23:10] He's speaking of the experiences of the
[1:23:13] days past as dirty rags of yesterday.
[1:23:17] Okay, listen. If you remain that way,
[1:23:19] it's it's just become dirty rags all the
[1:23:22] time. It served its purpose as clothing,
[1:23:26] but now it's become paper. That means
[1:23:29] the experiences of yester year
[1:23:34] the those clothes that were used for
[1:23:37] Martin Luther's time, John Wesley's
[1:23:40] time, for the day of Pentecost time,
[1:23:43] they have been worn thin till they are
[1:23:46] no longer clothing. It's become like
[1:23:49] paper. They've been dirtied like rags.
[1:23:54] That's what he's saying, right? Wait for
[1:23:56] it. Justification
[1:24:00] served its time in justification under
[1:24:03] Luther. Then it had to come. Now, we're
[1:24:05] not saying you cannot you must not be
[1:24:07] justified. You must not be sanctified.
[1:24:09] But you cannot live under justification
[1:24:10] only. You cannot live under
[1:24:12] sanctification only. Justification, he
[1:24:14] says, served its time under Luther. Then
[1:24:17] it became sanctification through Wesley.
[1:24:20] And sanctification served its time till
[1:24:23] it become the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:28] Now, here's where I said it's going to
[1:24:29] shock you. And the baptism of the Holy
[1:24:32] Ghost served its time until the Holy
[1:24:37] Spirit.
[1:24:39] See, this is why I preached the Holy
[1:24:42] Ghost and the Holy Spirit because you
[1:24:44] have quotes like this which says the
[1:24:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost. There's
[1:24:48] brother Brandham making the distinction
[1:24:50] between the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:52] and the person and he uses the word Holy
[1:24:55] Spirit.
[1:24:57] The baptism of the Holy Ghost served its
[1:24:59] time until the Holy Spirit. Did you see
[1:25:02] that? Justification served its time.
[1:25:06] Sanctification served its time. Baptism
[1:25:08] of the Holy Ghost served its time until
[1:25:12] the Holy Spirit, which there's only one
[1:25:15] God, blends into the church and the
[1:25:18] church into Christ and it makes Jesus
[1:25:21] Christ reflected on earth what he
[1:25:24] promised here in the Bible. Might not
[1:25:27] believe it. I can't make you do that.
[1:25:29] I'm only responsible for the word.
[1:25:33] Saints, I know there was a lot of
[1:25:35] reading, but it's going to get to where
[1:25:37] we answer the questions.
[1:25:41] What I have been doing all the time is
[1:25:44] putting things together for the young
[1:25:46] people, using the words of the prophet
[1:25:48] to make them understand what he means.
[1:25:52] Not circumventing what he said, not
[1:25:54] trying to tell you not to believe what
[1:25:55] he said, NOT TRYING TO GO AGAINST the
[1:25:58] two quotes or against the one the
[1:26:00] scripture from the Bible about no, we've
[1:26:03] never been doing that. I've been taking
[1:26:06] all these things put I could not teach a
[1:26:09] series on the Holy Ghost there in North
[1:26:11] America. I taught it here in our church.
[1:26:14] I put all these things together
[1:26:16] expecting the people to be mature.
[1:26:21] sadly.
[1:26:24] So now
[1:26:26] you need to explain to your people what
[1:26:29] it means by the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:31] Ghost served its time until the Holy
[1:26:35] Spirit blends into the church and the
[1:26:38] church into Christ bringing Christ
[1:26:41] reflected on earth. Justification served
[1:26:45] his time under Luther. Wesley
[1:26:47] sanctification served his time under
[1:26:48] Wesley. Baptism of the Holy Ghost served
[1:26:51] its time in Pentecost until
[1:26:54] the Holy Spirit blends into the church
[1:26:57] and the church into Christ. Praise be to
[1:27:01] God. That's that's what we're teaching
[1:27:03] saints. This is the revelation we live
[1:27:05] under. I'm not saying anything the
[1:27:08] prophet hasn't said. Okay, that brings
[1:27:12] us to question one.
[1:27:16] Question one says, I have a question.
[1:27:20] What is the real baptism of the Holy
[1:27:22] Ghost? This is a question from a young
[1:27:25] person from Central Africa. Okay. I I I
[1:27:29] I don't give you names, but I'm telling
[1:27:31] you it's a person from Central Africa. I
[1:27:34] have a question. What is the real
[1:27:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost that can take
[1:27:38] me to the rapture or resurrect a
[1:27:41] sleeping saint? How can I be sure?
[1:27:46] Saint you know these questions can make
[1:27:48] me cry because
[1:27:52] you know
[1:27:54] they're only have these questions
[1:27:55] because it is being misrepresented to
[1:27:58] them
[1:27:59] from the start. They're being
[1:28:02] manipulated. They're being controlled
[1:28:06] by and and something I've learned in
[1:28:08] this entire
[1:28:10] uh experience
[1:28:12] is that these ministers don't even know
[1:28:16] what Holy Spirit means. They don't
[1:28:20] understand that holy means consecrated
[1:28:23] and that it's all relating to purpose
[1:28:27] and consecrated to the word for this
[1:28:30] day. It is not something that is a third
[1:28:34] person in the trinity. It is not another
[1:28:38] personality in the trinity. It's not
[1:28:41] something to argue about in the godhead.
[1:28:44] It's got something to do with God
[1:28:46] anointing man with the purpose for his
[1:28:49] day.
[1:28:51] That's what the Holy Spirit is.
[1:28:54] And if it's not being taught that way,
[1:28:56] you're going to produce weak people who
[1:28:59] are constantly falling.
[1:29:02] Okay? The real baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:07] is not a supernatural power that
[1:29:10] guarantees you a place in the rapture.
[1:29:13] I'm answering the question. Maybe when
[1:29:16] you read the quotes that in the message
[1:29:20] and I know because you go into the
[1:29:22] message, you can go and type in your in
[1:29:24] your table or uh whatever search engine
[1:29:27] you have and and you go look for rapture
[1:29:30] and holy ghost maybe and you'll see how
[1:29:32] brother talks about the Holy Ghost bride
[1:29:34] that takes the rapture. You got to have
[1:29:35] the Holy Ghost to make it in the
[1:29:37] rapture. I know the quotes, right? I
[1:29:39] don't have the time to go and read
[1:29:41] everything for you, but I'm I'm I'm
[1:29:42] telling you what it means now. And and
[1:29:45] you might read those quotes and and and
[1:29:47] ministers read those quotes who going
[1:29:48] then preach YOU'RE ONLY GOING TO MAKE IT
[1:29:50] IN THE RAPTURE IF YOU HAVE THE HOLY
[1:29:51] Ghost like this young person who is
[1:29:53] saying I want the right Holy Ghost to
[1:29:56] take me in the rapture or in other words
[1:29:58] if I die
[1:30:00] it will be what resurrects me. Why are
[1:30:03] they asking this? Because that's what
[1:30:05] they've been taught.
[1:30:09] Man,
[1:30:11] when you read the quotes, it might come
[1:30:13] across that way, but it's not because
[1:30:16] the Holy Ghost baptism falls on the just
[1:30:19] and the unjust.
[1:30:21] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is needed
[1:30:23] to fulfill the purpose of God. Right?
[1:30:26] So, here it is, young person. If you
[1:30:30] don't have it, here's what's going to
[1:30:33] happen. You will not fulfill God's
[1:30:35] purpose for your day.
[1:30:37] You might be a good Christian. You might
[1:30:39] be keeping all the message standards,
[1:30:41] going to church and all that. You will
[1:30:43] be living as a Christian, but you are
[1:30:45] living for your own purpose. You are
[1:30:48] following the message because you want
[1:30:49] to find someone to marry. You want to
[1:30:52] have children. You want to be successful
[1:30:55] in your life. You want to be happy. You
[1:30:57] want to make sure your wife or your
[1:30:58] husband is in line with the word. And
[1:31:00] it's ensuring you a happy marriage. You
[1:31:03] are just living the life of a message
[1:31:05] person. You are following Christianity.
[1:31:07] You are being a good person because it
[1:31:09] benefits your own purpose. But when you
[1:31:12] receive the Holy Ghost, it is a
[1:31:14] purposeful spirit. It is a purposeful
[1:31:17] nature. It's going to put a zeal in you
[1:31:20] to do something for God. It anoints you
[1:31:23] or indwells a man or both for the
[1:31:27] purpose of God alone, not you, not your
[1:31:30] life. It's going to it's going to turn
[1:31:33] your life upside down. It might actually
[1:31:34] make your wife hate you. It might
[1:31:36] actually make your children hate you. It
[1:31:39] This is the difference. The Holy Ghost
[1:31:41] is not something that's just going to be
[1:31:42] something to give you happy life where
[1:31:44] you all sing songs the whole day and
[1:31:47] have family altars. It's so beautiful
[1:31:49] and you pray together as a family. You
[1:31:51] go to church together as a family. No.
[1:31:54] The Holy Ghost has a purpose for where
[1:31:57] you live, for the country you are, for
[1:31:58] the city you are in. It's got a purpose.
[1:32:01] It's going to light a fire under you to
[1:32:02] do something for God.
[1:32:06] And you might be a person who's never
[1:32:08] ever going to be in the rapture and the
[1:32:11] Holy Ghost will come upon you to make
[1:32:12] you do something. Whoa. Where did you
[1:32:14] get that from, brother Alistister? Well,
[1:32:18] Balam was anointed by the spirit of God
[1:32:21] to with the spirit of prophecy for the
[1:32:24] purpose of God to bless Israel. And yet
[1:32:28] after that anointing was off him, Balam
[1:32:30] went off and became a false prophet to
[1:32:33] work against and circumvent the will of
[1:32:35] God and uh speak against God's people
[1:32:38] and and and and uh influenced the
[1:32:41] Moabitete king to bring Israel under
[1:32:44] condemnation by getting them to live
[1:32:45] immoral. Yet that man was anointed with
[1:32:48] the spirit of God for the purpose of
[1:32:51] God. That's what I'm saying. The Holy
[1:32:53] Ghost doesn't care about whether you're
[1:32:56] living righteous or not living
[1:32:58] righteous. If it's going to use you,
[1:33:00] whether you are good or bad, it's got to
[1:33:02] do with purpose. How much better if you
[1:33:05] are seed of God and you are anointed
[1:33:08] with a spirit of purpose to do something
[1:33:10] for the kingdom.
[1:33:13] The prophet even says in the Easter
[1:33:15] Seal, there'll be people, they'll never
[1:33:18] know it. They'll go right on thinking
[1:33:20] they're getting the Holy Ghost, being
[1:33:22] saved, and the rapture will be done over
[1:33:25] and gone with or over with [laughter]
[1:33:27] and gone.
[1:33:29] Right? The simple answer is this young
[1:33:32] young person. Many people will be
[1:33:34] baptized with the Holy Ghost, but not
[1:33:37] all of them will continue on in the
[1:33:40] word. There are literally people leaving
[1:33:43] the message who know they have the Holy
[1:33:46] Ghost because they have gifts. They they
[1:33:49] dream dreams. They see visions. They
[1:33:52] speak with tongues. To them they have
[1:33:55] used that Holy Ghost power is uh is
[1:33:58] anointing them to do something for the
[1:34:01] kingdom which God needs them to do. It
[1:34:04] might even be to keep certain people in
[1:34:07] a certain place.
[1:34:10] That's the Holy Ghost using that person
[1:34:12] because it's a purposeful nature. It's
[1:34:15] got a purpose behind it. It doesn't care
[1:34:17] about whether you are seed or not seed.
[1:34:21] That's the baptism of the Holy Ghost. It
[1:34:24] is not a special baptism. It's simply an
[1:34:27] anointing giving you ability that you
[1:34:30] couldn't possess on your own cuz it's
[1:34:33] not a human ability and it's given for
[1:34:36] the purpose of God. How can I be sure?
[1:34:39] Your question is my answer to you is
[1:34:42] don't stress about it. You don't need to
[1:34:44] be sure about what kind of Holy Ghost
[1:34:46] you have, whether it's going to take you
[1:34:48] in the rapture, whether it's going to
[1:34:49] resurrect you if you die. Don't stress
[1:34:51] about it. Just keep believing the word.
[1:34:54] Stay true to the word all your life.
[1:34:57] That's what it's about. That's all that
[1:34:59] matters today. It's all about the word
[1:35:02] for your day. Don't try to make up
[1:35:04] reactions or feelings or emotions or act
[1:35:08] like something you're not. Don't be an
[1:35:11] actor.
[1:35:13] Don't in imitate other people. Be true
[1:35:17] to yourself. Be real. Only believe and
[1:35:21] let the word govern your life. He
[1:35:24] promised he will anoint you with power
[1:35:27] that is necessary for you. Amen.
[1:35:32] All right, let's bring this to a close
[1:35:33] with something with the the second and
[1:35:35] third question.
[1:35:37] And to me, this is
[1:35:40] this is of most of highest importance
[1:35:43] for these young people. Okay,
[1:35:51] here's the question. There are two
[1:35:53] question two and three. I've put them
[1:35:54] together because they uh are relating to
[1:35:58] the same thing that I'm going to be
[1:35:59] speaking on.
[1:36:01] I tell you honestly saints when I read
[1:36:02] these questions it just makes me cry.
[1:36:05] You know I've done my fair share of
[1:36:07] crying alone in my study asking God to
[1:36:12] help these young people because of the
[1:36:15] way they've been taught things. It
[1:36:16] really breaks my heart. Here's a
[1:36:19] question of a young man. Does the Holy
[1:36:22] Ghost leave after we sin? There's a
[1:36:24] young man from India.
[1:36:26] Now I know that we sin daily every day
[1:36:28] as brother Brandham talks in Hebrew
[1:36:30] series but still sometimes I feel that I
[1:36:33] love the world but at the same time I
[1:36:36] also know that I love the revelation of
[1:36:38] the word. Now I want to know how to
[1:36:41] overcome this and also what it will take
[1:36:44] to completely purge the worldly lusts
[1:36:47] diverse lusts of the flesh and
[1:36:48] completely abiding and resting in the
[1:36:51] word. Okay. Question three.
[1:36:54] If I have received the Holy Ghost at a
[1:36:57] youth camp and had an experience with
[1:36:59] God, what happens if I backslide or mess
[1:37:02] up again? Does it mean I am lost beyond
[1:37:06] restoration according to Hebrews 6 4-6
[1:37:10] and Hebrews 10:26?
[1:37:14] Okay,
[1:37:17] so those two scriptures, right? Hebrews
[1:37:20] 6:4-6, "For it is impossible for those
[1:37:22] who are once enlightened and have tasted
[1:37:24] of the heavenly gift, and were made
[1:37:26] partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have
[1:37:27] tasted the good word of God, and the
[1:37:29] powers of the world to come, if they
[1:37:31] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[1:37:34] repentance, seeing they crucify to
[1:37:35] themselves uh the son of God, aresh, and
[1:37:39] put him to an open shame." Hebrews
[1:37:42] 10:26-29.
[1:37:44] For if we sin willfully after that we
[1:37:46] have received the knowledge of the
[1:37:47] truth, there remainth no more sacrifice
[1:37:49] for sins, but a certain fearful looking
[1:37:52] for of judgment and fiery indignation
[1:37:55] which shall devour the adversaries. He
[1:37:58] that despised Moses law died without
[1:38:00] mercy under two or three witnesses. Of
[1:38:02] how much more sore a punishment suppose
[1:38:04] ye shall you be thought worthy who had
[1:38:07] trodden underfoot the son of God had
[1:38:09] counted the blood of the covenant
[1:38:10] wherewith he was s san san san san san
[1:38:11] san san san san san san san san san san
[1:38:11] san san san san san sanctified an unholy
[1:38:13] thing and had done despite unto the
[1:38:16] spirit of grace
[1:38:20] all right saints I just fellowshipped
[1:38:22] about this with the saints in Newcastle
[1:38:25] on Sunday
[1:38:27] and I said to them have you noticed that
[1:38:31] there are people in the world, they are
[1:38:35] great rich men now turning to
[1:38:37] Christianity, men and women, and they're
[1:38:40] looking for help. They believe
[1:38:42] Christianity can help them overcome
[1:38:45] alcoholism, drug addiction, depression.
[1:38:49] [snorts]
[1:38:50] And uh I I said to the church in
[1:38:52] Newcastle, "Have you noticed that the
[1:38:55] ones who are letting everybody down are
[1:38:58] the Christians? Because there are these
[1:39:01] people who were atheists and now in the
[1:39:03] world, you know, people like Elon Musk
[1:39:06] and others who are claiming that they
[1:39:09] want to know God and they they believe
[1:39:11] there is a God. They just don't know.
[1:39:14] It's incredible. These people are
[1:39:16] billionaires and now they're desiring to
[1:39:19] be Christians. It it's happening at at
[1:39:22] an express rate. There are there are
[1:39:24] people in the United Kingdom where in
[1:39:27] the UK
[1:39:29] the young people are becoming alcoholics
[1:39:31] by the time they are 26 because there's
[1:39:33] a culture there. You finish work, you go
[1:39:35] to the pub every day and then Friday to
[1:39:38] Sunday you drink until you are drunk and
[1:39:41] then you you only like come right by
[1:39:45] like Tuesday or Wednesday and then
[1:39:47] there's a few more days and then you hit
[1:39:49] Friday again and you're back. By the
[1:39:52] time it's become a culture there so that
[1:39:54] the young people by the time they are 26
[1:39:57] are addicts.
[1:39:59] Now they have reached 35 40 years and
[1:40:03] they've suffered. They are
[1:40:05] professionals. They are they are
[1:40:08] lawyers, doctors and you name it. They
[1:40:10] are professionals.
[1:40:13] They are rich and they cannot overcome
[1:40:16] alcoholism. Now they are hearing of
[1:40:18] their friends who are recovered because
[1:40:21] they became Christians. Now they all
[1:40:23] want to become Christians. Why do they
[1:40:25] want to become Christians? Because they
[1:40:27] want to give up alcoholism, drugs,
[1:40:29] depression. They believe it's a quick
[1:40:31] fix. And many of them are finding
[1:40:33] victory,
[1:40:35] right? Not realizing that it is faith
[1:40:38] that is doing the healing, right?
[1:40:41] And believing that is actually doing the
[1:40:43] healing. But they are still going to
[1:40:45] Alcoholics Anonymous. They are still
[1:40:47] doing all these other things. Which
[1:40:49] means at a certain time if they don't
[1:40:51] continue on into believing the word,
[1:40:54] they are going to fall back into the
[1:40:56] very vices they are trying to escape.
[1:41:00] Now let's bring this to you as
[1:41:03] believers. These scriptures look like
[1:41:08] that if you were once enlightened, if
[1:41:11] you receive the baptism of the Holy
[1:41:12] Ghost, if you taste of the heavenly
[1:41:14] gift, and if you fall away, it's
[1:41:17] impossible for you to be renewed to
[1:41:20] repentance.
[1:41:22] These Hebrews 10 speaks as if if you sin
[1:41:25] willfully after receiving the knowledge
[1:41:28] of the truth, there remainance there
[1:41:31] remains no more sacrifice for sin.
[1:41:33] there's his judgment. Okay.
[1:41:36] To explain this, the first thing you
[1:41:38] need to know is know the nature of God.
[1:41:42] Simple things in the message. Brother M
[1:41:44] says, "God does not save you today to
[1:41:46] lose you tomorrow."
[1:41:48] My question is, do you really think that
[1:41:52] Christ,
[1:41:53] who is God made flesh, came down to
[1:41:57] deliver mankind
[1:41:59] and then gives you the Holy Ghost, an
[1:42:02] anointing to give you purpose, and then
[1:42:05] you go and backslide or live
[1:42:07] unrighteously for a moment or even some
[1:42:10] days that you're you're done for. You're
[1:42:13] lost. It's over. There's no hope.
[1:42:16] there's no restoration because that's
[1:42:18] what these scriptures look like. You you
[1:42:22] if you read this without revelation, you
[1:42:24] are going to fall away. I've had young
[1:42:25] people literally telling me, "Brother
[1:42:27] Alistister, I've crossed the line. It's
[1:42:29] over.
[1:42:31] I've tasted out the heavenly gift. I've
[1:42:34] trampled on the blood of Christ. It's
[1:42:35] over for me." And here am I asking them,
[1:42:39] "But do you believe the word?"
[1:42:41] [laughter]
[1:42:42] I'm pleading with them, "Do you believe
[1:42:44] the gospel? Do you believe the word of
[1:42:45] God? you believe it, the message to be
[1:42:47] the truth, then you haven't crossed the
[1:42:50] line. And they're saying, "But according
[1:42:52] to this, according to Hebrews chapter 6,
[1:42:55] according to Hebrews chapter 10, I'm
[1:42:57] lost because I I've been to the youth
[1:43:00] camp. I receive the Holy Ghost and then
[1:43:01] I go mess up a week later or two weeks
[1:43:04] later or 6 months later and I messed up.
[1:43:06] That means I'm lost." Right?
[1:43:09] And this is what makes me cry because
[1:43:11] they are not being taught right
[1:43:15] here. Brother Marram says there are
[1:43:17] quotes. Those who came out of Egypt died
[1:43:20] in the wilderness. He says they were
[1:43:22] brought up to the Holy Ghost but never
[1:43:24] truly received it. There it is. They
[1:43:28] were given a taste but they were never
[1:43:30] they never truly received it. In the
[1:43:33] church ages he speaks about a vision.
[1:43:35] Brother Brandon speaks about a vision
[1:43:37] where he sees the sewer who goes forth
[1:43:39] to sew seed and then someone comes who's
[1:43:41] dressed in black and um sews evil seed
[1:43:44] among the in among the good seed and it
[1:43:47] comes up and the rain falls on the just
[1:43:49] and the unjust and he said those who
[1:43:52] fall away
[1:43:54] were falling away right and he explains
[1:43:57] it he says though they had the Holy
[1:43:59] Ghost they were never true seed to begin
[1:44:02] with that's what he saw Right.
[1:44:06] But to you young people who believes
[1:44:09] God's word, if you go off and you you
[1:44:13] fornicate
[1:44:15] or you go and and mess up with
[1:44:17] pornography or something, it's
[1:44:20] backsliding. Brother man said these
[1:44:23] people who fall away are not backsliding
[1:44:27] because they were never seed of God to
[1:44:31] begin with. That's the message, right?
[1:44:34] He said to you, he said this, he
[1:44:36] realized these are quotes. Brother Mam
[1:44:38] says these this is not backsliding.
[1:44:42] It's about disbelieving the word. So to
[1:44:46] answer this question to you, what we're
[1:44:49] saying to you is and this is not some
[1:44:52] something to make you feel uh safe. No.
[1:44:58] All right. Brother Baron says in another
[1:45:00] place in Hebrews 10, he says um what
[1:45:04] this means is if you sin willfully that
[1:45:07] we you those of you receive the
[1:45:09] knowledge of the truth. He explains this
[1:45:11] another way. He says when God forgives
[1:45:14] you, when you ex come to Christ, you
[1:45:16] accept the blood of Christ, you accept
[1:45:17] Calvary, you accept the Lord as your
[1:45:19] personal savior, and you receive
[1:45:21] salvation, he says God has forgiven you
[1:45:26] right there for all the sins of your
[1:45:28] past. But thereafter, everything that
[1:45:31] you do, you going to pay for.
[1:45:35] That blood is not forgiving you for what
[1:45:38] you are going to do that is wrong.
[1:45:41] This is what people keep doing. People
[1:45:44] keep claiming and and you get into this
[1:45:46] false sense of salvation that, oh, every
[1:45:51] time I make a mistake, I plead the blood
[1:45:53] of Christ. I plead the blood of Christ.
[1:45:54] I plead the blood of Christ and he
[1:45:56] forgives me because I'm still believing
[1:45:58] in Calvary. No, you came to salvation.
[1:46:01] You had an experience. He forgives you
[1:46:03] for your past. You repent of the things
[1:46:06] you thought that was God before that.
[1:46:08] He's forgiven you from that. Thereafter
[1:46:12] you are accountable for every wrong
[1:46:15] thing, every unrighteousness that you
[1:46:19] do, every backslidedness that you do,
[1:46:22] you are accountable for it. Afterward,
[1:46:26] this is what is missing from the
[1:46:29] preaching at youth camps is teaching you
[1:46:32] accountability.
[1:46:34] That's what we teach you. You are
[1:46:36] accountable, young people, for what you
[1:46:38] do.
[1:46:40] Okay. To you who believes the word,
[1:46:43] those who leave the message, I want
[1:46:45] those who leave the message never truly
[1:46:47] believed it in the first place. I I know
[1:46:49] this. I I can tell you I told one
[1:46:53] person, "Brother, you were never really
[1:46:57] taught the message. You were taught
[1:46:58] brandism.
[1:47:00] That's why you're antibrandom because
[1:47:03] you were you were introduced to
[1:47:04] brandomism. You became a brandite." I I
[1:47:08] said to him, I'm not a Brandomite. I
[1:47:10] never was a Brandomite. I believe the
[1:47:12] prophet to be the prophet of the last
[1:47:15] age and the one who God chose to be a
[1:47:19] part of the opening of the seventh seal.
[1:47:20] It's a glorious ministry. It's the the
[1:47:23] greatest thing in my life. But I'm not a
[1:47:26] Brandomite. I was never sold on stories
[1:47:28] of William Brandom. I was never excited
[1:47:31] about God of prophet and and shouting
[1:47:35] every time or hearing something about
[1:47:37] this type being a prophet this type. No,
[1:47:39] I'm more interested in what he said
[1:47:41] about me becoming Christ in this last
[1:47:44] day.
[1:47:45] Right? And so those who leave the
[1:47:48] message, I'm telling you, never believed
[1:47:50] it in the first place or they were never
[1:47:53] introduced to it in the first place. And
[1:47:55] I believe a lot of them have hope to
[1:47:58] come back because what they rejected was
[1:48:01] not the truth. They were not shown the
[1:48:03] truth.
[1:48:05] Some of them have. Some of them have
[1:48:07] rejected it.
[1:48:09] But maybe they followed it for family
[1:48:12] sake, financial gain, personal gain or
[1:48:15] popularity until the popularity runs
[1:48:18] out. And while they were following it,
[1:48:20] if they were convinced in themselves
[1:48:23] through reasoning
[1:48:25] uh or uh that it was good and that it
[1:48:28] was true, but then the truth is they
[1:48:32] were in it because it was working for
[1:48:34] them and at that time and then they were
[1:48:37] forced into it by whatever reason,
[1:48:40] right? The parents forced them, pastor
[1:48:41] forced them or circumstances forced
[1:48:44] them. And then when that runs out, when
[1:48:46] the reason why they were in it runs out,
[1:48:49] then they are forced to leave it for
[1:48:53] whatever reason. And and that reason
[1:48:54] runs out, they feel suddenly, oh been
[1:48:57] let down and uh they denounce their
[1:49:00] faith in it and they speak so
[1:49:02] bombastically against it. You know what
[1:49:05] happens then is what they don't realize
[1:49:08] when they do that? They leave. They go
[1:49:11] on the internet. They fight against the
[1:49:14] message people. They fight against
[1:49:15] William Brandham. They they expose it.
[1:49:18] They expose the churches. They fight
[1:49:21] against everybody.
[1:49:23] What they're actually expressing is how
[1:49:27] weak they were because apparently you
[1:49:31] were duped into something that was not
[1:49:35] true. What you're saying is you're a
[1:49:38] person that can be duped. You were
[1:49:40] duped. That's what you're saying. You're
[1:49:42] exposing weakness, right? It's like, for
[1:49:45] example, saying you fell in love with a
[1:49:48] girl, you believe she's your soulmate,
[1:49:50] you married her, you confess she's your
[1:49:53] soulmate, and then you divorce her after
[1:49:55] 10 years. So basically, you're a person
[1:49:58] who doesn't know who your soulmate is.
[1:50:00] and you're a kind of person who's so
[1:50:02] easily convinced, you're then going to
[1:50:04] find another one who you think is going
[1:50:05] to be your soulmate and uh and it
[1:50:08] indicates spiritual weakness and you
[1:50:11] know it. That's why you're so angry
[1:50:13] about it. Now you're you're going online
[1:50:16] and you're trying to convince other
[1:50:17] people about how virtuous you are by
[1:50:20] demonizing your ex.
[1:50:24] That's a real thing. That's that's
[1:50:26] really telling. And they don't realize
[1:50:28] it. rather just walk away, be happy in
[1:50:31] your choice, let it go, and you'll be
[1:50:34] happier.
[1:50:36] Right? In closing, young people, to
[1:50:39] answer this question,
[1:50:44] the answer is accountability.
[1:50:47] This is what's wrong with when you go to
[1:50:49] youth camps, youth meetings, and they
[1:50:52] tell you that you must just receive the
[1:50:55] Holy Ghost. And that's the answer. No,
[1:50:59] you must be accountable. This is the
[1:51:02] problem with Christians today. You don't
[1:51:05] hold yourselves accountable for the
[1:51:07] wrongs that you do. You are using the
[1:51:10] message and the Holy Ghost as a cover up
[1:51:13] for wrongdoing. When you mess up, the
[1:51:17] right thing to do as a Christian is
[1:51:19] afflict your soul.
[1:51:23] Nobody's teaching you that. Nobody's
[1:51:25] teaching you that you must afflict your
[1:51:27] soul. You are SUPPOSED TO FEEL BAD about
[1:51:30] it. You are supposed to feel rotten
[1:51:33] about it. YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO COME
[1:51:35] BEFORE God on your knees crying out and
[1:51:37] repenting for it. You are supposed to
[1:51:40] afflict your soul. Go read uh Feast of
[1:51:43] Tabernacles. Get into the booth and
[1:51:46] afflict your soul.
[1:51:50] You and I should be afflicting our soul
[1:51:52] every single day as a believer for every
[1:51:55] wrong thing we say, everything we think,
[1:51:58] every time we get on our knees, Lord,
[1:52:00] forgive me. I said this, I did this. I
[1:52:04] was wrong with to do this. The reason
[1:52:07] why you don't go and correct it. Listen,
[1:52:10] I don't like apologies. Everybody in my
[1:52:13] family knows that. To me, apologies are
[1:52:15] quick fixes. Oh, I'm so sorry. You know
[1:52:19] that what does that mean? I don't I
[1:52:22] don't even want an an elder to apologize
[1:52:25] to me. It's a very awkward thing. What
[1:52:26] am I going to do if an el if one of
[1:52:29] these elders who spoke against me or
[1:52:30] said something about me? I don't even
[1:52:32] want them to apologize to me. I just
[1:52:34] want them to understand me so and we can
[1:52:37] have an understanding and go on being
[1:52:38] brothers. It's so awkward when you have
[1:52:40] someone apologizing. What do I say? What
[1:52:42] do I say to someone who's who says to
[1:52:44] me? I'm so sorry, brother Alistister. I
[1:52:46] called you these names. What do I say?
[1:52:48] I'm stand I'm going to stand there and
[1:52:49] my lips are going to be like, you know,
[1:52:52] I don't know what to say. What am I
[1:52:53] going to do? Hug them and say, "Oh, it's
[1:52:55] okay, brother. I've I feel like I'm
[1:52:58] making myself feel so great now that I
[1:53:00] am absolving them of their sin." It's
[1:53:02] just an such an awkward thing. Uh that's
[1:53:05] just how I feel to me. If he's my elder,
[1:53:09] spoke against me, just forget about it,
[1:53:11] you know? Go put it right with God.
[1:53:13] Let's understand one another. Let's live
[1:53:15] as brothers. Let's shake hands, hug one
[1:53:16] another, and move on.
[1:53:19] But the fact is, if somebody afflicts
[1:53:22] their soul, makes it right with God,
[1:53:24] that's taking accountability for what
[1:53:26] has been done wrong, that's what's not
[1:53:29] being taught. Listen, there are young
[1:53:33] people who've listened to what I
[1:53:34] preached and who've taken
[1:53:37] accountability. There's there's young
[1:53:38] people who say to me, "Brother Elsa, I'm
[1:53:40] doing everything. I I am I am changing
[1:53:43] my phones. I'm changing my laptop. I'm
[1:53:46] changing this. I'm I I'm I'm finding
[1:53:48] purpose. I'm doing this for God. I'm
[1:53:50] preaching. I'm testifying. Uh I I'm I'm
[1:53:54] doing everything I can for the gospel.
[1:53:55] I'm I'm I'm doing what you said. That is
[1:53:59] taking accountability.
[1:54:01] That is what is necessary. Right? So in
[1:54:05] closing, saints, I want to reiterate
[1:54:08] that my concern for young people born in
[1:54:11] the message is because I have sons, I
[1:54:14] have nieces and nephews as well as
[1:54:17] children of many dear friends who are
[1:54:20] born in the message. I I want to say
[1:54:23] this to you with the utmost humility.
[1:54:26] If there is anyone you should get to
[1:54:29] hear from, it is from me. I have lived
[1:54:32] this life. I was born in this message.
[1:54:34] If there's any advice these ministers
[1:54:36] should be taking for the children born
[1:54:39] in this message is from me. I know what
[1:54:42] works. I am what you preached about. I
[1:54:47] have lived this life. If there's anyone
[1:54:50] you should hear or hear what I have to
[1:54:53] say because I know what works for all
[1:54:56] those people around me who criticize me
[1:54:59] for not being more emotional or
[1:55:03] charismatic or not having the spirit.
[1:55:07] I'll tell you right now, what I've had
[1:55:10] my whole life is the power and anointing
[1:55:12] to keep me from fornication, from
[1:55:15] worldliness, from evil music,
[1:55:19] from smoking and drinking and carousing
[1:55:22] with the world throughout my life. And I
[1:55:24] have been in every situation you can
[1:55:26] think of. I've been to college. I've
[1:55:28] been away from home for four years.
[1:55:31] Three uh three years studying away from
[1:55:34] my family. Uh, I have been I I played
[1:55:38] sports. If there's ever ever was a
[1:55:40] weakness I had would have been sports.
[1:55:42] I've been uh on sports teams. I've been
[1:55:45] on school trips. I've lived in the house
[1:55:48] with a drug addict uh on a on a camp
[1:55:51] that we had to do, a political camp that
[1:55:53] we had to do in school in which this guy
[1:55:55] took me to every single dealer
[1:55:58] uh because he was my ride home from the
[1:56:02] school to his home. He I the schools put
[1:56:05] me to stay with this guy and uh I've
[1:56:08] been in every single situation you can
[1:56:10] think of. I've been in situations where
[1:56:13] there were girls who tried to approach
[1:56:15] me. I've been to places where um there's
[1:56:18] a school dance and I'm sitting outside
[1:56:21] the hall while the dance is going on.
[1:56:23] I've been through these situations. I
[1:56:26] have been through I know what works. And
[1:56:30] I'm telling you, this idea of going to
[1:56:33] camps where they tell you walk you up
[1:56:35] into an emotion, I know it doesn't work
[1:56:38] because all of my friends in the message
[1:56:41] who went that way fell.
[1:56:44] Okay? This is why I'm saying to you, I'm
[1:56:47] not saying this from a place of pride.
[1:56:49] And I'm not saying this because I have
[1:56:52] so many friends and people who I admire,
[1:56:56] people who I have the greatest respect
[1:56:58] for. Some of them who are ministers who
[1:57:00] have come out and told me, "This is what
[1:57:03] I done in my life. This is where I
[1:57:05] transgressed. This is where I fell. This
[1:57:07] is what happened to me." And they have
[1:57:09] come to full restoration. And God has
[1:57:12] brought them. They are the most
[1:57:14] wonderful people. When I hear their
[1:57:16] stories, I just cry buckets because of
[1:57:18] what I know God has done for them. In no
[1:57:21] way am I placing myself above those men
[1:57:23] because I believe the in the work of
[1:57:26] restoration that God can do in people.
[1:57:28] So I do not say this from a place of
[1:57:30] pride. But I'm telling you, if you have
[1:57:32] children who are born in the message and
[1:57:36] who are struggling right now, I know
[1:57:38] what works because I was that a young
[1:57:41] person born in the message in a pastor's
[1:57:44] house, having all the guns trained on
[1:57:46] you, having everything spoke corrected
[1:57:49] from the time you could walk from the
[1:57:51] time you were when you were a teenager
[1:57:53] corrected in everything on your
[1:57:55] dressing, on your shoes, on your pants,
[1:57:57] on your shirts, on your hairstyle, on
[1:57:59] the way you play the piano on every
[1:58:01] single thing. I've lived this. I can
[1:58:04] tell you what works.
[1:58:08] Worship in church
[1:58:11] that doesn't you. Here's what works.
[1:58:13] Saints, young people, I'm closing. You
[1:58:16] need to worship in a church that doesn't
[1:58:17] teach brandism
[1:58:19] or that teaches the message as a cage.
[1:58:22] You cannot be in a church where they
[1:58:24] teach the message as a cage.
[1:58:27] This is what brings power. Profess your
[1:58:30] faith wherever you go. In school,
[1:58:35] in university, at work, in public.
[1:58:40] Profess your faith wherever you go. This
[1:58:43] is what gives you power. I'm telling you
[1:58:44] what works. Not some anointing in a
[1:58:47] church camp. This is what works. You are
[1:58:50] accountable for everything that happens
[1:58:53] after you receive salvation. It's not a
[1:58:57] fix all. It's a doing thing. Profess
[1:59:02] your faith. Your your friends at school,
[1:59:05] tell them, "No, sorry. I don't do this.
[1:59:08] I am a Christian." Profess your faith. I
[1:59:11] don't listen to that music. I'm a
[1:59:13] Christian. I don't smoke. I'm a
[1:59:15] Christian. I don't dance. I'm a
[1:59:17] Christian. I don't go to the Matrix
[1:59:20] ball. I don't go to Deb's ball because
[1:59:23] I'm a Christian. I don't listen to that
[1:59:25] kind of music. I'm a Christian.
[1:59:27] Profess it and hold yourself accountable
[1:59:30] to it. They will hold you accountable.
[1:59:34] Study the word from your youth. Do not
[1:59:37] stop studying the word right through
[1:59:39] your life. While you're in in in a
[1:59:43] university, when you're married, do not
[1:59:46] stop studying that word. Do not delve in
[1:59:49] worldly music. Do not become comfortable
[1:59:52] with worldly friends. Attend every
[1:59:55] church service you can.
[1:59:58] You understand? The Holy Ghost is a
[2:00:01] purposeful nature. It is not a one-time
[2:00:06] fix all thing. That is a lie. Th this is
[2:00:10] the right this is not psychology. This
[2:00:13] is the right thing to do. This is what
[2:00:15] is going to give you the word inside and
[2:00:17] the indwelling.
[2:00:19] If you don't profess your faith, you
[2:00:21] will never be someone who testifies
[2:00:23] about the word. If you tell as many
[2:00:25] people, I know this BECAUSE I KNOW IT
[2:00:27] WORKS. I've been through it. I've lived
[2:00:29] this, right? And I'm telling you, if you
[2:00:33] profess your faith, if you become a
[2:00:35] witness of the message and what you
[2:00:37] believe, when your friends question you,
[2:00:40] I I'm could tell you stories. We will go
[2:00:42] on forever if I tell you the stories of
[2:00:44] my life. Eventually, my friends would
[2:00:48] stand up for me. There were girls in my
[2:00:51] class, in my school, who would tell
[2:00:53] other girls from other school, "Don't
[2:00:56] touch this boy. Don't come near him.
[2:00:58] Don't ask him to dance. He's not going
[2:00:59] to do it." They would say to the other
[2:01:01] girls from the other school, "He's a
[2:01:03] good boy." Why would they do that?
[2:01:06] Because I already told my friends in
[2:01:08] school, I will not date in school. I
[2:01:11] will never have a girlfriend in school.
[2:01:13] I said this from the time I got into
[2:01:14] high school. I will ne and I was in a
[2:01:16] co-ed school. I will never have a
[2:01:18] girlfriend in school because I believe
[2:01:21] I'm only going to have a girlfriend when
[2:01:23] it's time to be married.
[2:01:25] I professed it every year of my life. I
[2:01:27] professed it in school, in university,
[2:01:30] college, wherever I went. I professed
[2:01:32] it. The only girl I'm ever going to
[2:01:34] marry or ever going to date is the one
[2:01:36] I'm going to marry. That's it.
[2:01:39] Profess it. hold yourself accountable to
[2:01:42] it. That accountability is not being
[2:01:45] taught in the message and that's a
[2:01:48] problem. So saints,
[2:01:51] I'll be praying for your children as you
[2:01:53] pray for mine.
[2:01:55] I'm I'm going to be as Christ is. I'm
[2:01:58] not going to judge you. I'm not going to
[2:02:01] hold anything against you like the like
[2:02:03] the woman in the street. Go and sin no
[2:02:06] more.
[2:02:07] afflict your souls, young people, every
[2:02:09] day of your lives. Afflict your souls.
[2:02:13] Go to that Holy Spirit and tell him,
[2:02:16] "Forgive me. Forgive me for my words.
[2:02:18] Forgive me for my thoughts." Every
[2:02:20] single day of your life when you get
[2:02:21] down to pray. Forgive me, Lord.
[2:02:25] Hold yourself accountable for every
[2:02:27] action of unrighteousness.
[2:02:29] That is what the Holy Spirit respects.
[2:02:32] And he will lead you into all truth.
[2:02:34] That is a promise he's made to us.
[2:02:37] May the Lord bless you. I trust that
[2:02:39] this is going to help you. I know it's a
[2:02:41] Wednesday night and it's been long. Um
[2:02:44] and um of course I didn't expect it to
[2:02:46] be that long, but I trust that it's
[2:02:49] going to help your children and I want
[2:02:52] you to know what my heart is. I'm not
[2:02:54] here I like I've said to our our church,
[2:02:57] I feel like I got 10 years left. You
[2:02:58] know, God willing might even take me
[2:03:02] away sooner. I don't know. But if I have
[2:03:05] 10 years left, this is what I'm going to
[2:03:07] do. Tell the truth, speak what God wants
[2:03:10] us to say, and help this generation
[2:03:12] fight their fight that I didn't have to
[2:03:15] fight. I don't have the the the the
[2:03:18] uh temptations that they are facing
[2:03:20] today. And we've got to do all we can.
[2:03:23] Those of you who are uh adults in this
[2:03:27] fight with me, we've got to stand
[2:03:29] together. We've got to be examples for
[2:03:31] these young people. We can't be teaching
[2:03:33] them the wrong thing. We we've got to
[2:03:35] provide the the platform for them. We've
[2:03:38] got to provide the way. They must know
[2:03:40] there's a way back. They must know that
[2:03:43] we are the church here to apply the bomb
[2:03:46] in Gilead. We are here to help them uh
[2:03:49] through these situations. But at the
[2:03:51] same time, when something is wrong,
[2:03:54] we've got to call it out. And we've got
[2:03:56] to help them hold themselves accountable
[2:03:59] and know that we are not their judges.
[2:04:01] They must be the judge of themselves.
[2:04:04] And if they can do that, they'll become
[2:04:05] stronger people. And uh know that none
[2:04:09] of us are perfect. Every one of us, me,
[2:04:12] brother Alistister, I'm holding myself
[2:04:14] accountable every day to God for
[2:04:17] anything I think wrong or say wrong or
[2:04:19] whatever. I will check with people that
[2:04:22] even are close to me. Did I say the
[2:04:24] right thing? Did I do the right thing
[2:04:25] here? When do how do I do this? I'm
[2:04:28] holding myself accountable for the
[2:04:30] purpose of God because I want to do that
[2:04:33] which is right. And yet I know I am
[2:04:35] human. I have failures. I have uh things
[2:04:40] that are just um that I'm born with that
[2:04:43] I have to deal with. My race, my
[2:04:45] culture, my speech, my expressions,
[2:04:48] so many more things, personal things.
[2:04:52] So that's what we need to be doing. May
[2:04:54] the Lord bless you and until we meet
[2:04:57] again. For those of you, uh, Sunday
[2:04:59] service will most likely we'll be
[2:05:01] streaming again. Uh, and, um, we trust
[2:05:04] that it'll be a blessing to you. May the
[2:05:06] Lord bless you. Until we meet again, God
[2:05:08] bless.
