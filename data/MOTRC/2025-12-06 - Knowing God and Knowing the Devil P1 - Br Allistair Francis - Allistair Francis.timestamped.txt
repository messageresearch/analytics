[0:01] Amen. While you're standing, we like to
[0:04] read in our our Bibles or you can follow
[0:07] with us on the screen.
[0:10] We're going to begin by reading a
[0:13] scripture from Psalm 96 verse 10 to
[0:16] verse 13. And that's before you can take
[0:20] your seats.
[0:23] Wonderful portion of scripture here.
[0:27] The word reads like this.
[0:30] Say among the heathen that the Lord
[0:33] reignth.
[0:35] The world also shall be established that
[0:38] it shall not be moved. He shall judge
[0:41] the people righteously.
[0:44] Let the heavens rejoice and let the
[0:46] earth be glad. Let the sea roar and the
[0:50] fullness thereof. Let the field be
[0:53] joyful and all that is therein. Then
[0:56] shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
[1:00] before the Lord, for he cometh, for he
[1:03] cometh to judge the earth. And here it
[1:06] is. He shall judge the world with
[1:09] righteousness, and the people with his
[1:13] truth. Amen. The Lord add a blessing to
[1:15] his word. You may be seated.
[1:19] He shall judge the world with
[1:21] righteousness and the people with his
[1:24] truth.
[1:25] We like to greet you in the precious
[1:27] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:29] Christ. Certainly good to be with you
[1:30] all this morning and uh thankful to God
[1:33] for his grace and mercy with us. As some
[1:36] of you know from the prayer requests and
[1:39] so on. It's been a difficult week. Uh
[1:42] but every one of us has these weeks at
[1:44] times. We got to just go through it,
[1:46] push through it, and uh let our faith
[1:48] bring us out of it. Amen. So we'd like
[1:51] to uh welcome all of you and especially
[1:54] our visitors which is part of the Drais
[1:57] team sitting out here in the second row.
[1:59] Welcome young men. It's an honor to have
[2:02] you with us. God bless you. I hope I
[2:04] don't confuse you too much today.
[2:08] And I preach very long.
[2:10] Okay. So I hope you kept your had a good
[2:13] night's sleep last night.
[2:15] All right. So I always like the young
[2:18] people and I prefer speaking to young
[2:21] people which is why I always say old
[2:24] people have already made up their minds
[2:27] and it's very hard to change them and uh
[2:30] with young people they are lives that
[2:32] are being molded and especially after
[2:34] what we're going to be speaking today
[2:36] you'll realize how important it is that
[2:38] they receive the word of God. The word
[2:40] of God is is becoming a
[2:43] a very scarce commodity today because
[2:47] the world is uh is is pushing other
[2:51] words into our children and into society
[2:54] which is why it is decaying the way it
[2:57] is. So we want to speak this morning on
[3:01] a subject called knowing God and knowing
[3:04] the devil
[3:06] and uh the spirit of truth and the
[3:08] spirit of lies is our title. So just to
[3:12] bring you into it, this is another
[3:14] message inspired by what we spoke about
[3:17] to the Sunday school recently.
[3:19] And so we learned in the story of God
[3:22] and man that before there was anything,
[3:25] before God was even called God,
[3:28] uh before anything was created, he was
[3:31] like this fountain of life. There was no
[3:34] form. There was he had no form like a
[3:36] man. And uh he had to make himself
[3:40] visible in a heavenly realm. But the
[3:42] question is what was he? Was he man?
[3:48] Did God have a body? What form was he
[3:51] in? Did he even have a form? Does God
[3:54] need a form? Right? And you think about
[3:57] all the uh arguments that people have
[4:00] today. And one of the reasons why
[4:02] people,
[4:04] you know, I would say the chief reasons
[4:06] that people today become atheists is
[4:09] because of those who believe in God.
[4:15] Did you get that? Hope you didn't miss
[4:17] that. The chief reason people become
[4:20] atheists is because of people who
[4:22] believe in God. Because the ridiculous
[4:26] ideas we tell them,
[4:28] &gt;&gt; yes,
[4:28] &gt;&gt; is what makes them think this can't be
[4:30] true.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; And it sounds like a whole bunch of
[4:34] nonsense.
[4:36] And so if you if we keep going around
[4:38] like the world is tearing in absolute
[4:41] nonsense and pedalling in it and uh
[4:44] trading it
[4:46] &gt;&gt; uh by their words and preaching a Jesus
[4:49] Christ that
[4:50] is foreign to what the Bible teaches.
[4:53] Teaching a god that is not what the
[4:56] Bible teaches.
[4:58] And like like Christ himself says
[5:00] teaching for God the traditions of men.
[5:04] Then the the people on earth are going
[5:06] to smell a rat.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; They're going to know you're not
[5:09] speaking the truth and you're not
[5:12] presenting something that is real. And
[5:14] you don't need education. You don't need
[5:17] science. You don't need convincing to
[5:20] believe in God. Humans have this gift
[5:24] &gt;&gt; of sensing truth.
[5:27] And so when you present something that
[5:30] has any speck of lies in there, you'll
[5:32] see it all over them. You'll see this
[5:38] or
[5:39] or or
[5:46] some kind of defensive form. Humans
[5:49] already know this. If you meet somebody
[5:52] and you greet them or something happens
[5:55] because there's some sense in you that
[5:57] recognizes danger and knows truth and
[6:00] lies. You don't you don't even have to
[6:03] be educated into it. It just happens.
[6:05] When someone tells you something, you'll
[6:07] see you'll see our hands. Our hands are
[6:10] the biggest language because our hands
[6:12] actually are telling us whether we are
[6:14] sensing lies or whether we are even
[6:15] speaking lies. Because when we are
[6:17] speaking lies, we will block our mouth.
[6:20] We will distract. We'll put our hands
[6:21] behind our back. We'll put our hands
[6:23] behind. This this form of crossing hands
[6:25] is a defensive nature which means you're
[6:28] concealing something or you're insecure
[6:31] about something. And then you find on
[6:34] the other hand the narcissist, the man
[6:36] who is absolutely brilliant at telling
[6:38] lies will come out and stand like that
[6:44] because he's so confident in his lie
[6:46] that he's deceiving you with his
[6:48] openness
[6:50] and you think, "Wow, this guy's
[6:52] impressive. This guy is telling the
[6:53] truth."
[6:55] And we've had these experts at lying and
[6:59] deceiving
[7:00] ruling mankind for a very long time.
[7:04] They wrote books that we read. They made
[7:08] religions that we believe. They have
[7:10] taught us things that we accept.
[7:14] Right? And you can see people pushing
[7:16] back today. I mean, if they actually
[7:18] produced
[7:20] proper truthful evidence of landing on
[7:23] the moon, then anyone everybody will
[7:25] believe it. There's a whole lot of
[7:27] people in the world who just don't
[7:28] believe anybody landed on the moon. And
[7:30] there's a whole bunch of scientists
[7:32] working to prove it. And there's a whole
[7:34] lot of scientists working to say that's
[7:36] lies. And there's a whole lot of other
[7:38] things that we are presented with every
[7:40] single day.
[7:42] Amen. And this is why we're speaking on
[7:44] the spirit of truth and the spirit of
[7:46] lies.
[7:48] And so probably the biggest lie I would
[7:51] say that exists in the world is who God
[7:53] is and who is the devil.
[7:57] Because if you can make the devil as
[7:59] scary as possible, you can scare people
[8:02] into following a religion.
[8:05] And then if you can make God as
[8:07] judgmental as possible, then you can try
[8:09] and make sure people follow God in case
[8:12] bad things happen.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; And those are just not the truth. Right?
[8:19] So this is why when we began on the
[8:21] series of uh the story of God and man
[8:25] and uh we began to teach the the young
[8:27] people uh how everything began how uh
[8:31] God brought everything into being how
[8:33] creation came into being and then some
[8:36] years ago in I I can't remember what
[8:38] year it was could have been 2018 or
[8:39] something where we did the the one big
[8:41] youth meeting with all the youth in
[8:43] Durban and we did
[8:46] uh who is God and who is the devil. Some
[8:48] of you are older ones will remember
[8:49] that. So, we're coming back to that some
[8:52] of that. So, that because there's a lot
[8:54] of the um youth who are here today who
[8:57] were actually kids back then. All right?
[8:59] And then of course the adults miss out
[9:02] on the youth meetings. So, we're going
[9:05] to bring it all in. Now, remember
[9:08] God became visible first in a heavenly
[9:12] state, in a heavenly dimension. You
[9:14] remember that story of God and man. And
[9:16] then he became the logos. But the logos
[9:19] was a form that he became,
[9:22] right?
[9:24] And but who is he? If God takes on a
[9:28] form, is the form who he is? Who is God?
[9:33] That's the question. How can you worship
[9:36] something? How can you bow down to
[9:38] something? How can you follow something
[9:40] when you don't know what it is?
[9:43] &gt;&gt; Right? That means if you are worshiping
[9:46] something that you don't know, you're
[9:48] actually deceiving yourself. Agreed? So
[9:52] who is he? And if God dwells in a body
[9:57] or exists in a form,
[10:00] is that form who he is? These are the
[10:04] questions we need to ask. So what about
[10:07] you? Right? All of you sitting here,
[10:10] you are definitely bodies. I can see
[10:13] that thankfully all humans, no aliens in
[10:16] our presence. Okay. But who are you? Are
[10:20] you that body?
[10:22] Is that body who you are? Does that body
[10:25] define who you are?
[10:28] Okay. Uh or are you your brain?
[10:33] That clumpy mass of gray cells inside
[10:36] your head. Is that who you are? Are you
[10:39] your thoughts?
[10:42] Are you your heart? Maybe by heart I
[10:45] don't mean the pumping organ inside your
[10:47] chest. I mean like the the imaginational
[10:51] center of who you think you are, right?
[10:55] You know, like when you act out and uh
[10:57] and people say, "Oh, you're you're like
[10:59] this." And and you'll say, "Well, you
[11:01] don't really know who I am. Do you know
[11:03] who you are?"
[11:06] Now, how are people not knowing who you
[11:09] are? Oh, why don't you tell people who
[11:10] you are then? Why don't you uh express
[11:14] yourself clearly so everyone does know
[11:16] who you are? You can't even do that
[11:19] unless you know who you are. Are you
[11:22] with me? Am I confusing you solid?
[11:25] Okay. So, are you your heart? Are you
[11:28] your mind? Are you your body? Who are
[11:31] you? What are you? Right. In the same
[11:35] way, who and what is God really? How can
[11:41] you know there's a in the Bible
[11:43] under the um the Jewish dispensation
[11:46] when God brought in the book of
[11:47] Leviticus and the Levitical law, he told
[11:49] them not to make any idols, graven
[11:53] images, not to worship anything, bird,
[11:56] fish, animal, male, female, rock,
[12:00] whatever it is. Do not make any image
[12:02] and say that is me. And don't worship
[12:05] that as if you are worshiping me. That
[12:08] is idolatry.
[12:10] Why? Why would he do that? Because when
[12:12] you focus on a form, you you have a
[12:15] nature to obsess on the form. And then
[12:18] humans don't stop there. You start
[12:20] making replicas of that form. You start
[12:23] drawing pictures of it. You then start
[12:25] putting crowns on it. Then you start
[12:27] decorating it. Then you start painting
[12:29] it. Then you put it in some place. Then
[12:31] you start making people pay to see it.
[12:33] Sounds like a religion, right?
[12:37] That's why idolatry is evil.
[12:41] Are you with me?
[12:42] &gt;&gt; All right. So, who is God really? And
[12:46] how can we best describe his nature?
[12:48] Okay. So, the best thing to do because
[12:51] you have already come into this world
[12:53] and unfortunately every one of you have
[12:56] been fed a bunch of lies. From the time
[12:59] you could hear and understand and read,
[13:02] you were fed lies.
[13:04] We know this. Now, some of you don't
[13:07] know this. You are about to know this.
[13:10] Okay? So, begin to understand who God
[13:12] really is. We first have to tell you
[13:15] what is not God.
[13:19] &gt;&gt; See, all the world has told you about
[13:22] God. And almost everything you believe
[13:24] about God is a lie.
[13:27] So let's begin.
[13:30] Where is God? This is not God.
[13:36] This comes from medieval paintings,
[13:39] medieval, middle ages,
[13:42] European people
[13:45] who
[13:46] uh had these great artists during the
[13:49] Renaissance period, you know, the the
[13:51] period of Leonardo da Vinci and
[13:53] Michelangelo and they're great men,
[13:55] great talented men. but by their artwork
[13:58] they deceived the whole world because
[14:00] God does not have a massive throne in
[14:03] the clouds.
[14:05] That's just false.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:07] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't have winged angels flying
[14:10] around in space.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; And um
[14:16] you know I did this uh I did this um
[14:19] experiment. I do this experiment
[14:21] wherever I go, wherever I preach,
[14:22] especially with young people as well. I
[14:25] tell everybody, close your eyes and
[14:28] imagine God,
[14:30] right? And everybody imagines God like
[14:33] that. How do you how did that happen?
[14:36] How is it possible that the entire human
[14:38] race imagines God the same way? We live
[14:41] in South Africa where the majority of us
[14:44] are black people. Even black people see
[14:46] a white god
[14:49] and it's got nothing to do with race.
[14:52] I I even asked the the young black kids,
[14:55] "Who is God? Is he dark skin or fair
[14:57] skin?" He's fair skinned. He's white.
[15:00] It's got nothing to do with race. Who
[15:03] told you God even has a race?
[15:07] &gt;&gt; Blonde hair, blue eyes, brown hair.
[15:10] What? Why does God even need hair?
[15:13] Does he have a bad hair day sometimes?
[15:16] Why does he have to have a beard?
[15:18] Because in the Renaissance period, a man
[15:20] with the beard showed wisdom, so they
[15:23] drew him with a beard. And then um does
[15:26] he have light shining from him? Does he
[15:29] have a halo around his head? Is he
[15:31] giant? Why does he have to be a giant
[15:35] and have a massive chair? Why does God
[15:38] need to sit? Does he get tired?
[15:44] See, I told you it's all been lies
[15:47] and we accepted it and we s we drew the
[15:50] pictures.
[15:52] Nobody sees a black god. I mean, African
[15:56] and nobody sees an Indian god either.
[15:59] Just they're expecting him to have more
[16:01] arms than normal. Maybe
[16:04] nobody does. Uh and this goes into the
[16:07] denomination. This is definitely not
[16:09] God. Can you see that? old man. He looks
[16:12] like he can barely move,
[16:15] &gt;&gt; you know. And then I don't know what
[16:16] they're holding. Maybe that's earth.
[16:19] They look giant. And the dove there
[16:22] flying in who knows where. The dove,
[16:24] which is an earthly creature, is
[16:25] supposed to be the Holy Ghost
[16:28] &gt;&gt; just because of a scripture that says
[16:30] descended like a dove from heaven. Like
[16:33] a dove.
[16:35] But no, there is a winged creature, foul
[16:40] bird called the Holy Ghost in these
[16:43] pictures. And there's all these people
[16:45] around, they're angels, you know, and
[16:49] the one thing that always gets me about
[16:51] how they paint God is so feminine
[16:55] and Jesus.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; They look like all they have is no
[16:58] muscle.
[17:00] They're just love, right? compassion.
[17:06] So feminine I don't get it. They all
[17:08] paint them like that. This children is
[17:12] not God.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; It's been a lie. Okay. And neither is
[17:17] Jesus sitting there next to and they all
[17:19] dressed in robes, you know, like why
[17:21] don't they dress like us?
[17:24] Why do they dress like people from 4,000
[17:26] years ago? What? Did they not get the
[17:28] fashion magazine?
[17:31] did not update themselves.
[17:34] I I told you the reason I speak like
[17:36] this is to mock it
[17:38] &gt;&gt; so you understand it
[17:42] &gt;&gt; because okay let me put it this way
[17:45] because of the indoctrination of these
[17:48] pictures when you see it in your mind
[17:52] that's what you assume a holy man should
[17:54] look like and a prophet should look
[17:56] like. They should be dressed in robes
[17:59] from 4,000 years ago or 2,000 years ago.
[18:02] Which is why when a a man of God today
[18:04] speaks to you who's dressed like me, you
[18:07] don't consider him to be a man of God as
[18:10] compared with those.
[18:13] And therefore, the way you are, you
[18:15] can't even see yourself as a man of God
[18:18] because you just don't compare to that
[18:20] image. Yeah.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; And this is definitely again not God.
[18:28] God does not care for gold
[18:32] from earth, crowns,
[18:35] an orb from the Catholic Church, and a
[18:40] staff. What is that? What is it? That's
[18:42] like Zeus and Apollo. That's what that
[18:45] is, right? It's not even God. And
[18:48] there's the dove again with a ring
[18:49] around his head this time. And there's
[18:52] clouds. Lord knows where those clouds
[18:55] are.
[18:58] All right. So God is not an old looking
[19:00] white man or light-skinned man or black
[19:03] man or Indian man who lives in the
[19:04] universe and nowhere. Nowhere live
[19:09] parked somewhere off in a galaxy far far
[19:11] away. No. Right. Not sitting upon a
[19:16] giant throne doing nothing else. What
[19:18] does God do? Nothing else but sit
[19:22] and all the angels must come in all the
[19:24] time bowing down singing choir in
[19:28] heaven. And then there angels bowing
[19:31] down, raising hands, throwing down
[19:32] crowds. All this happens while this old
[19:34] man just sits and says, "Give me more.
[19:36] Give me more. Come on. Give me more. A
[19:38] little bit louder there. A little bit
[19:40] better this way."
[19:42] Lies.
[19:45] Right. And with Jesus sitting there next
[19:47] to him, you know, usual story, son who
[19:50] doesn't have a job,
[19:56] making nothing but weird signs,
[20:01] like peace and the scout symbol, you
[20:03] know,
[20:05] and all those things. That's all. Jesus
[20:07] is just sitting next to the father doing
[20:09] nothing. Doesn't have a job. The only
[20:11] thing is when some poor soul on earth
[20:13] who has a real problem and needs some
[20:16] help, he whispers in prayer to Jesus and
[20:18] then Jesus says, "Hey, Dad, got a guy
[20:21] has a problem. Please help him out. He
[20:24] really liked me when I was on earth."
[20:26] THAT'S JESUS'S JOB. APPARENTLY,
[20:30] lies again. And then, you know what?
[20:33] Things get really tough. Things get
[20:36] really tough because now there's 7
[20:37] billion people on the planet. You know,
[20:39] Jesus can only hear so many prayers at a
[20:42] time, you know. So, let's employ some
[20:44] saints
[20:46] who will then, you know, Christopher and
[20:47] Martin and Thomas and who else? These
[20:50] these saints and don't forget Mary.
[20:52] She's also got a heavy schedule. She
[20:53] needs a secretary, you know, and then
[20:56] you pray to them and they'll escalate
[20:59] your prayer to Jesus who will escalate
[21:01] your prayer to God. And hopefully by
[21:03] next year you might get it, you know,
[21:05] before you fill out the pink slip and
[21:07] the blue slip and the yellow slip and
[21:08] reach second floor and third floor. And
[21:10] it's like a like they're telling us it's
[21:12] a business, the business of heaven. You
[21:15] got to go through this one first. You
[21:17] have to go to your pastor and your
[21:18] pastor will take your prayer to saint
[21:20] whoever and the saint lies
[21:24] and YOU'VE BEEN SWALLOWING IT. THIS
[21:27] WORLD has been swallowing it. Let's not
[21:28] even get to other religions. At least
[21:31] we've got two and a couple of saints.
[21:33] There are others who've got thousands.
[21:35] I don't know how their management goes.
[21:37] Some of them have gods up and below and
[21:40] everywhere. And uh depending on what you
[21:43] want, you have to make sacrifices to
[21:46] wherever to to get some answer from
[21:48] somewhere.
[21:50] Let's not even go there.
[21:54] Okay. This was a lie started by ancient
[21:56] religions. The reason why Christians
[21:58] adopted these things is because of
[22:01] paganism and heathenism
[22:04] &gt;&gt; and because those narcissistic men who
[22:07] wanted to control humanity hijacked
[22:10] Christianity and stuck all the paganism
[22:13] in there and put fear into mankind.
[22:18] God's name is not just Jehovah or Yahweh
[22:22] or Elohim.
[22:24] God does not even need a name to call
[22:26] himself by. Look at just the idea of
[22:29] that. So if you don't pray to God, if
[22:31] you don't call out to God in Jehovah or
[22:34] Elohim or Yahweh or Jesus, he won't hear
[22:37] you.
[22:39] You know, that's a really bad boss.
[22:43] You know, it's like, I need something,
[22:45] but just because I don't use those
[22:47] specific names, he's not going to hear
[22:49] me.
[22:52] Oh, you got to use that name.
[22:55] And here's the problem. This is the
[22:56] reason man always asked for a name.
[23:00] That's why God gave them one
[23:04] and not a name to tie himself down by
[23:06] that this is his only name. THIS IS THE
[23:09] MOST POWERFUL NAME. NO,
[23:12] those names that reveal who God is in
[23:15] that period of time, right? I remember I
[23:18] told you this. He reveals himself to
[23:20] Abraham. He's al Shadhai. Then he's he
[23:22] reveals himself to Moses as Jehovah. And
[23:25] then the the name Jehovah is used for
[23:28] some period of time. And then u uh
[23:31] Samson's father who's Manoah asks the
[23:34] angel tell us what is your name? He says
[23:36] why do you ask my name? Don't you know
[23:38] it's a secret?
[23:40] How is his name a secret in Monoah's day
[23:43] when he was revealed as Jehovah and El
[23:45] Shadai in other days? Because the name
[23:48] of God is just simply this. the
[23:50] revelation of God for that present day.
[23:54] &gt;&gt; That's what you call on. And you don't
[23:56] call on a name like Alistister, John,
[23:59] Mark, Joseph, whatever. You don't.
[24:02] That's not it. It's a revelation of God.
[24:05] That is a name.
[24:07] See, our names mean nothing. They're
[24:09] just names our parents gave us. You know
[24:12] that they're a form of identification to
[24:14] see who you are in this time. That's all
[24:16] we use names for. Names don't even
[24:18] define you anymore.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; Right? Names used to be something that
[24:23] gave you identification, a proper
[24:25] identification of where you came from,
[24:28] who you are, where what your lineage is,
[24:30] which land you come from. You don't even
[24:33] have that,
[24:35] right?
[24:36] It's just names and surnames today. So,
[24:40] who God is or what his name was in any
[24:42] time was the was the revelation of him
[24:45] for that time. Amen. And he was the the
[24:48] name Jesus. Now why Jesus is important
[24:52] is the revelation of Jesus. What is
[24:54] Jesus?
[24:56] There's no power in the literal name
[24:59] because we know in Spain there's plenty
[25:01] of Jesuses running around kicking a
[25:03] soccer ball for fun.
[25:05] &gt;&gt; Jesus and whatever. Everyone's isus
[25:10] in the Greek and and and uh in all the
[25:12] languages we've got all these people who
[25:14] are named Jesus. They don't walk around
[25:16] with halos and supernatural powers and
[25:20] every time someone shoots them, they
[25:21] rise from the dead.
[25:24] No, there's no absolutely no power in
[25:27] that literal name. But there's power in
[25:29] the revelation
[25:31] &gt;&gt; of who Jesus was 2,000 years ago.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:36] &gt;&gt; That's why it has become the name above
[25:39] all names. It is the most relatable name
[25:43] to humankind.
[25:46] Okay, let's move on. Because of the
[25:49] misunderstanding of who God is,
[25:51] religions that were formed on earth have
[25:54] led people to terrible beliefs, even
[25:57] more terrible ways of worship. Okay? And
[26:01] so, this is going to be a minieries. So,
[26:03] we're going to get to some other things,
[26:04] but I just want to lay the foundation
[26:06] for today. So
[26:09] these religions that have been fueled
[26:12] and and founded on lies has made life on
[26:15] earth follow a massive and terrible lie.
[26:21] The Lord Jesus came to manifest
[26:25] God in flesh to us. Who God really is.
[26:31] Amen.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he told us something
[26:34] important, something phenomenal.
[26:38] God is a spirit.
[26:42] That's what he told us. Now in
[26:45] Christianity, it's been commonly
[26:47] believed that like you saw in those
[26:49] pictures, God is the father. Jesus is
[26:52] the son of God. Everyone's heard that,
[26:54] right? So they they took God and they
[26:57] made him two people. And then they put
[26:58] the dove there, the holy ghost and that
[27:00] there are three trinity, holy trinity
[27:03] they call it, right? Christians have
[27:05] believed since they converted from
[27:08] heathenism and paganism. Okay, so for
[27:11] some of you who don't know, heathenism
[27:13] is or heathen is a word in the Bible
[27:15] which means somebody who doesn't know
[27:17] God, somebody who worships God through
[27:19] idols of rock and wood and stone and so
[27:21] on like that. and paganism as people who
[27:24] actually have a belief in they worship
[27:27] the creation the earth trees you know
[27:31] like um not even having to form an an
[27:34] idol or an image they literally worship
[27:36] the creation they have you heard of what
[27:39] is it ga earth mother and a whole lot of
[27:43] other things uh we did some of it some
[27:45] time ago in different teachings but
[27:47] that's what paganism basically is about
[27:49] and they have these very some of them
[27:52] very nice, fascinating rituals, you
[27:55] know, uh different kinds of weird
[27:57] prayers and meditation and you know,
[27:59] burning of incense and beliefs in in in
[28:02] rocks and minerals and uh um gases and
[28:06] air. It's very very um creationbased,
[28:10] right?
[28:11] And so when Christianity came to the
[28:15] Gentiles because we already had those
[28:18] things, we put them into Christianity.
[28:22] Right? So the Lord Jesus himself in the
[28:27] words recorded of him seems to give
[28:31] glory to the father. We know that,
[28:34] right?
[28:35] And so the father they what happened
[28:38] with heathenism and paganism is they
[28:40] said the father is god in his own form
[28:44] in his own body and Jesus is the son of
[28:47] god in another form in his own body and
[28:50] that according to the bible is
[28:52] absolutely false.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; I the lord your god am one lord. You
[28:58] shall have no other god beside me.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:01] There is no second person or third
[29:04] person. He is one Lord.
[29:08] Okay? Already people be confused like,
[29:10] "Okay, but what about the father? What
[29:12] about the son?" Well, we've taught you
[29:14] that. So, Christians have argued about
[29:17] this for over 2,000 years. And it's
[29:20] separated. Christianity separated into
[29:23] many groups. Some of them are called
[29:24] Trinitarians. They worship and they
[29:27] believe. They hold as the foundation of
[29:28] their belief the Holy Trinity. And then
[29:30] you have the others who are oneness,
[29:34] right? Just one. Jesus is that body that
[29:37] is God. It's like the idol. And it's not
[29:40] exactly the oneness doctrine of the
[29:42] oneness Pentecostal movement. But then
[29:44] it separated people into different
[29:46] groups. And then there's others who
[29:47] believe in a two-part godhead, father
[29:50] and son. So the real problem is
[29:54] all Christians today cannot agree on who
[29:57] God is. Is the Father God? Is Jesus God?
[30:01] Is the Holy Ghost God? Is the Holy
[30:04] Spirit and the Father the same person,
[30:06] the same being? Are they not? Why are
[30:08] they not? All these questions and they
[30:10] just circle it. They skirt the issue.
[30:14] They don't answer the questions. So,
[30:16] what does the Lord Jesus himself say?
[30:20] All right, are you with me?
[30:21] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a really fascinating
[30:23] discussion about uh this particular
[30:26] situation. John 4:24,
[30:29] God is a, this is the Lord Jesus
[30:31] speaking, God is a spirit, and they that
[30:35] worship him must worship him in spirit
[30:38] and in truth. We're going to break that
[30:41] down for you, right? But firstly, if
[30:44] Jesus was God, why now? He's a he's a
[30:47] man standing there speaking to the woman
[30:50] at the well and he says God is a spirit
[30:53] and if you worship him you must worship
[30:55] him in spirit and in truth. Why is he as
[30:58] a man standing there? If he was God why
[31:01] is he saying God is a spirit?
[31:04] Why didn't he just say I am God? This is
[31:08] what all those Christians who are
[31:09] trinitarians will tell you. Why didn't
[31:12] he just say I am God? Why didn't he just
[31:14] tell the people what they wanted to
[31:16] hear? He was definitely Christ was
[31:19] definitely speaking in harmony with the
[31:21] rest of the scriptures. Why? Because
[31:23] when God spoke to Moses through the
[31:25] pillar of fire, was the pillar of fire
[31:28] God?
[31:29] No. The pillar of fire was the veil
[31:32] through which the spirit of God spoke.
[31:35] When he spoke through the pillar of
[31:36] cloud, was the cloud God? No. He spoke
[31:40] through the cloud. He used the cloud as
[31:42] a veil to hide whatever there was to
[31:46] hide. Are you with us?
[31:48] &gt;&gt; And so in the same way when he spoke
[31:50] through angels, when he came as the
[31:53] angel of the Lord speaking to Samson's
[31:55] father, the angel itself was not God,
[31:58] but the spirit was God.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so in Jesus Christ, he did
[32:06] Christ never asked us to make idols of
[32:09] that body.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. and make figures and
[32:12] statues and pictures and worship the
[32:14] picture or worship the statue or worship
[32:17] the body. That would be incorrect with
[32:20] what the Bible teaches.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; The vessel or the veil or the body is
[32:28] what he hides himself behind.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the Bible. Okay. So uh we
[32:36] also have to make a note that he was not
[32:38] speaking the this is what I love about
[32:41] the situation. Christ here is not
[32:45] speaking to great theologians in Bible
[32:47] schools and professors and holy men and
[32:50] kings. He's these profound words
[32:54] are being spoken to a nobody.
[32:58] a woman who is rejected.
[33:01] She's not even Jewish for crying out
[33:03] loud. She's not even Israelite. He is
[33:05] supposed to be an Israel. He's an
[33:06] Israelite apparently. And he's speaking
[33:08] to them to her. And she even says to
[33:11] him, "You're not supposed to be speaking
[33:13] to me according to the law because
[33:15] Samaritans were outcast people. They
[33:17] were literally Gentiles
[33:19] who had ties by blood somehow to
[33:22] Abraham." Right?
[33:25] So um he's not speaking to even holy
[33:29] men. This this passage of scripture WITH
[33:32] THIS PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING OF GOD is
[33:35] not even spoken to a church or holy men
[33:39] or priests or prophets. It's spoken to a
[33:42] nobody.
[33:44] That's what I find so amazing about it.
[33:47] Okay, I'll I'll stop my amazement for
[33:50] another time. But we also have to make
[33:52] note that he was he was speaking to
[33:55] somebody who are you all with me? HE DID
[33:59] NOT HAVE TO DO miracles for her.
[34:03] He didn't have to do any healing. He
[34:05] didn't have to do any spiritual event.
[34:09] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to raise someone from the
[34:11] dead.
[34:12] She was not even an Israelite. All he
[34:16] did was speak the word
[34:19] &gt;&gt; and the truth to her.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; That's what I like message people to
[34:25] wake up and believe here and see.
[34:29] To everyone ELSE, HE HAD TO DO SOME
[34:31] MIRACLE. He had to heal the leper, heal
[34:35] the sick, open the eyes of the blind,
[34:37] raise the dead, uh feed the 5,000 with
[34:41] with uh five loaves of bread and two
[34:44] fishes. But with this woman, he just
[34:46] sits there and talks to her
[34:49] and reveals the most profound message in
[34:53] all scripture.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; All he did was speak the truth. Come on
[35:00] now. Let's wake up.
[35:02] Why am I telling you this? Because this
[35:04] is what he's doing with us.
[35:08] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what he's doing with the
[35:09] bride today.
[35:11] Everyone else is running around
[35:12] searching for miracles. I won't believe
[35:14] in God unless he heals me of cancer. I
[35:16] won't believe in God unless he does this
[35:18] for me. I won't believe in God unless he
[35:20] gives me this miracle. And churches are
[35:22] even uh advertising, come to our church
[35:25] for a miracle.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Why can you not believe God's word
[35:28] without a miracle?
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:33] All he did was speak the truth. He spoke
[35:36] the most amaz I want you to go back home
[35:38] today, sit down at lunch and read John
[35:41] 4, the chapter John 4, right? I want you
[35:45] to have a look at this conversation that
[35:46] he spoke with this woman at the well.
[35:49] It's fascinating,
[35:51] right? All he does is sit there and
[35:54] speak the truth to her, the
[35:56] unadulterated truth.
[35:59] No, no holes barred, no punches held. He
[36:03] just tells her the truth, right? And he
[36:07] spoke the most amazing mystery to this
[36:10] unknown woman.
[36:13] And after this great verse of saying,
[36:15] "God is a spirit. They that worship him
[36:17] must worship him in spirit and in
[36:19] truth." Yes.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; She then says this, "The woman said unto
[36:24] him, I know that when Messiah comes,
[36:27] which is called Christ," so she knows
[36:30] about Messiah and she knows about
[36:31] Christ. When he has come, he will tell
[36:35] us ALL THINGS.
[36:37] VERSE 26,
[36:39] JESUS said unto her, I that speak unto
[36:42] thee am he.
[36:44] He did not admit this to any other
[36:48] person
[36:50] &gt;&gt; in scripture
[36:52] &gt;&gt; to nobody else to not even the disciples
[36:56] not even the the people who not even his
[37:00] mother mother not even his village not
[37:04] even the people who tried him not the
[37:07] high PRIEST NOT ANY HOLY man he says it
[37:11] TO THIS WOMAN EVERYONE ELSE HE SPEAKS
[37:13] ABOUT THE SON of man shall do this, the
[37:15] son of man shall do this if you believe
[37:17] in my words and so on. This is the only
[37:20] person in all scripture that he says I
[37:24] am the Messiah.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; I am the Christ. I am he.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; I that speak unto thee am he.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; This is phenomenal. This is why I'm
[37:35] saying you really need to go and read
[37:37] this and chew the cut here. Right? when
[37:39] she hears him conclude John 4:24 and she
[37:43] said and and when he says God is a
[37:46] spirit and if you worship him you must
[37:48] worship him in spirit and in TRUTH HER
[37:50] REACTION TO THAT VERSE to those words is
[37:54] we know that when Messiah comes he will
[37:58] tell us all things it's related she
[38:02] didn't just come up with some
[38:04] &gt;&gt; something to say she didn't just say
[38:07] those WORDS SHE WAS SAYING THOSE words
[38:09] in reaction to we have to worship him in
[38:12] spirit and in truth.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; So why is she saying Messiah will tell
[38:15] us all things? Because all things were
[38:18] not yet told.
[38:20] In other words, she's saying how are WE
[38:22] GOING TO WORSHIP him in truth?
[38:24] &gt;&gt; If all THINGS ARE NOT TOLD,
[38:27] &gt;&gt; YOU understand it now. There we go.
[38:29] &gt;&gt; So she knew there was a need for all
[38:32] things. She knew there was a need for
[38:36] the truth to be told.
[38:38] SHE KNEW THAT HE WAS TELLING HER THINGS
[38:40] already that was stirring up her heart
[38:43] and things nobody else has ever spoken
[38:45] to her before. She had a sense
[38:50] &gt;&gt; that this is he.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; This is the reason why she even said
[38:54] that. We know that when Messiah who is
[38:57] called Christ when he comes
[39:00] see then he tells her the ultimate
[39:02] truth. I that speak unto thee am he.
[39:05] This is incredible. No theatrics,
[39:08] no speaking in tongues,
[39:10] &gt;&gt; no prophecies,
[39:12] no raising of the dead, no healing of
[39:15] the body,
[39:17] no miracle. She went away without any
[39:19] miracle being done for her. IN FACT, HE
[39:22] JUST TOLD HER THE BRUTAL TRUTH. You're a
[39:24] sinner. You've had five husbands and the
[39:27] one you're living with is not even
[39:28] yours. Right there, she should have
[39:30] turned around and said, you know, like
[39:32] we are today, who do you think you are?
[39:34] Like what IS YOUR PROBLEM? WHO DIED AND
[39:37] MADE YOU GOD? WHY ARE YOU JUDGING me
[39:40] like the young people today? So judgy
[39:43] h no nothing. She just sat there and
[39:47] listened.
[39:49] Imagine and this is why I say with judge
[39:52] people it's like we have to constantly
[39:54] deal with you with kid gloves. Imagine
[39:57] if I had to come and start off with you
[39:59] teaching you the word and start by
[40:01] judging you. start by telling you what's
[40:04] wrong with your life. You wouldn't even
[40:06] last 5 minutes.
[40:09] You'll be like, "Excuse me, I don't need
[40:11] to listen to this.
[40:14] I I'm asking you today, if Christ came
[40:16] to you and started with what's wrong in
[40:18] your life, how would you accept it?
[40:22] If you can't accept it from me, who is
[40:24] your brother? You think you're just
[40:27] going to accept it from Christ?"
[40:30] And he started there and went on with
[40:34] it. And she sat and listened
[40:38] despite the judgment that just came.
[40:42] Incredible.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; This is amazing to me that all message
[40:46] people need to see but cannot see. Why
[40:50] can you not listen when he speaks to us
[40:53] like he spoke to the woman at the well?
[40:55] Why do we behave like the 5,000 who were
[40:59] fed with five loaves and two fishes?
[41:02] How did they behave? THEY WERE JUST FED
[41:05] BY AN ABSOLUTE MIRACLE. They should have
[41:07] fell down there and worshiped God and
[41:10] said, "We believe you are Messiah. We
[41:13] are we understand all things now. We
[41:15] believe it. We have seen it for
[41:16] ourselves. Uh we will worship. Tell us
[41:19] anything we must do and we shall do it.
[41:21] WE WILL LAY DOWN our lives." Instead,
[41:23] they followed him across the Sea of
[41:25] Galilee wanting more food.
[41:28] And then he started speaking to them the
[41:30] brutal truth. And he said, "You seek
[41:33] meat that perishes.
[41:36] You want earthly blessings." In other
[41:38] words, I am the bread that came down
[41:40] from heaven. He starts speaking
[41:42] thoughtful ministry.
[41:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Your fathers looked for for
[41:46] meat that perisheth and they died in the
[41:48] wilderness. The bread that I give you
[41:50] will give you eternal life. Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; And then he GOES ON AND EXPRESSES the
[41:54] mystery. Eat my flesh and drink my
[41:57] blood. And they couldn't understand.
[42:01] He was not talking about physically
[42:02] eating him. Of course, he was talking
[42:04] about his word that they should believe
[42:07] his every word. They all turned against
[42:10] him, including the 70 disciples.
[42:14] The 70 disciples WHO HAD RECEIVED THE
[42:18] SPIRIT OF GOD FROM HIM TO GO AND CAST
[42:19] out devils and do healings. THEY ALL
[42:22] TURN AWAY FROM HIM when he spoke the
[42:24] brutal truth
[42:26] which tells you that the majority of
[42:29] people in the world if Christ should
[42:31] come like they want him to like they
[42:34] claim he's coming will reject him
[42:38] &gt;&gt; again
[42:39] &gt;&gt; because they did it the first time. I
[42:42] this is to me the the uh the idiocy of
[42:46] humans today to think that they've been
[42:50] waiting for Jesus to come the second
[42:52] time for so many years and that now if
[42:55] he comes we will believe him.
[43:00] This is the reason I say it's idiocy is
[43:02] because he already came the first time
[43:04] and only 12 believed
[43:08] &gt;&gt; 11. AND THE THE BIGGEST CHURCH HE HAD
[43:10] was 120
[43:12] &gt;&gt; who were left after he had ascended. You
[43:15] mean the Messiah himself couldn't have a
[43:17] 24,000 seater church,
[43:20] 50,000 SEATER CHURCH? YOU MEAN GOD
[43:22] HIMSELF made flesh? couldn't be so
[43:25] convincing to have the greatest church,
[43:28] the greatest movement.
[43:30] IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS THE TRUTH THAT THE
[43:32] whole world rejected him.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. No.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; And this is why I say it's idiocy to
[43:40] think that now
[43:42] Christians believe if he comes, if he
[43:44] shows himself, if he comes flying in the
[43:47] clouds and billowing in those clothes
[43:49] that they painted him in and he's just
[43:50] standing there in the heavens and and uh
[43:53] Jesus comes a second time and the
[43:54] trumpets are blowing and all the world
[43:56] is just going to say, "Oh my goodness,
[43:58] it's Jesus." All the Hindus and Muslims
[44:00] and poor people who didn't believe in
[44:03] Christ will say, "We were wrong. Let's
[44:04] all bow the knee and every tongue
[44:06] confess that Jesus is Lord. Lies.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; No one's going to believe it. I told you
[44:13] the first thing is the new generation
[44:14] will say that's some kind of hologram.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; CNN will be saying, "What is this? This
[44:20] is some some new scientific thing.
[44:23] People are flying in the sky. It cannot
[44:25] be." THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR
[44:27] power to speak against it.
[44:29] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORLD DOESN'T want Christ.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[44:34] They want lives
[44:36] &gt;&gt; like they're living now. They want sin.
[44:39] They want Netflix. They want movies.
[44:43] They want awful music. They want uh
[44:48] fornication, drugs, alcohol. They would
[44:51] rather drink themselves till they are
[44:54] drunk and passed out than ever hear the
[44:56] truth.
[44:58] They want to watch the rugby and drink a
[45:00] whole bunch of beer and belch like a
[45:03] sailor.
[45:05] They want to waste their time spending
[45:08] money on idiotic things. Nobody cares
[45:12] for the truth. And they all are saying
[45:14] in their drunken stuper that they are
[45:17] waiting for Jesus to come.
[45:20] Let's go to church on Sundays for Easter
[45:23] and Christmas
[45:26] and maybe Jesus will accept us.
[45:30] That's Christianity today. That's why I
[45:32] say to you, that's why we're getting
[45:34] more atheists because the Christians
[45:36] themselves don't believe
[45:38] &gt;&gt; and are not ambassadors at all of the
[45:40] word.
[45:42] So what is outstanding here is that if
[45:45] they fail to hear the word,
[45:49] if the people of earth today fail to
[45:53] hear and believe the word of God, God
[45:56] cannot even reveal truth to you.
[46:01] I am he.
[46:04] That's you know what I see in there? I
[46:07] am he. you that there's so much in there
[46:10] that's also saying I am here.
[46:14] I am here. The one you've been waiting
[46:16] for. I am here.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; I have come. I've been here for the last
[46:20] 30 years.
[46:22] Can you imagine all that dawning on her
[46:25] right there in that moment? That's why
[46:29] we read this Bible like a book of texts
[46:31] and scriptures. We don't get ourselves
[46:32] into the stand on the ground at the at
[46:35] the well where she stood and feel it.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; I am here. I am he. I have come. I'm the
[46:43] one the world has been looking for. And
[46:46] she's sitting there regarding this man
[46:47] who just looks like a normal man. You
[46:50] mean no halo,
[46:53] no uh supernatural powers,
[46:56] not doing anything fantastic. He looks
[46:59] tired, dusty from the travel. He looks
[47:01] thirsty and even hungry. He looks even a
[47:04] little bit sleepy. You mean that is God
[47:08] made flesh, the Messiah, the Christ?
[47:13] I am here going back to John 4:24. So,
[47:17] let's just read that quickly.
[47:21] I want to get to the next part. All
[47:22] right? And then we'll come back to God
[47:24] as a spirit. They that worship him must
[47:26] worship him in spirit and in truth.
[47:29] Okay, everybody from this church, you
[47:32] know what worship means. What is
[47:33] worship?
[47:35] To submit to. Worship in the Bible
[47:38] actually means to bow down to something.
[47:41] And I'll say it again. We all know this
[47:43] in English. We've known this for many
[47:45] years. You call a magistrate of the
[47:47] court your worship,
[47:51] right? Nobody goes to court and sings
[47:53] hymns and psalms to the magistrate.
[47:57] Praise be the magistrate.
[47:59] Hallelujah. That's not worship.
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Shouting hallelujah and singing and
[48:05] praying. That's not worship.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; That's praise.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. You can praise something and not
[48:14] worship it.
[48:17] That means you can sing to Jesus, you
[48:20] can sing to God, but in your heart you
[48:22] don't submit to his word. That's just
[48:24] praise. That's not worship. That's the
[48:27] same as when you're married and uh let's
[48:31] say you're you're the wife and you're
[48:33] sub supposed to submit to your husband
[48:35] and you give him gifts and you you um
[48:38] bestow praise upon him, but in your
[48:40] heart you don't really submit to him.
[48:43] You understand?
[48:45] So it's it's we do this all all around
[48:47] the world today. We give gifts. We give
[48:49] praise. We say to uh everybody, good job
[48:55] inside, he's still an idiot,
[48:58] &gt;&gt; right? YOU DESERVE A GIFT. WELL DONE.
[49:01] YOUR boss tells you, "Well done." Gives
[49:03] you some promotion incentive. In the
[49:05] meantime, he's got you where he needs
[49:07] you.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:09] H
[49:11] worship does not mean singing and
[49:13] praising. Worship is not prayer. Worship
[49:16] is not uh uh reading your Bible. Worship
[49:20] is not kneeling down. Worship is not
[49:23] closing your eyes like you make yourself
[49:25] look so serious.
[49:28] Praise be to God. No, that's religion,
[49:32] tradition, praising. Anybody can do that
[49:37] and bluff us. And there's no submission
[49:40] inside.
[49:42] Okay. To worship means to submit to a
[49:47] leadership.
[49:50] So how do you worship God in spirit and
[49:54] truth?
[49:56] How do you submit to him in spirit and
[50:00] truth? The first thing is you've got to
[50:02] say God is my headship. God is my
[50:06] leader.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Right? So two things. One, how do I
[50:11] submit to the leadership of God in
[50:14] spirit first?
[50:17] Then how do I submit to the leadership
[50:19] of God in truth? Second. Right? In
[50:23] spirit
[50:25] means not by works, not by religion,
[50:30] uh not by the mind, not by reasoning,
[50:34] but from deeper within.
[50:37] deeper than that. Okay? Not by works of
[50:41] the flesh or by this is why Christians
[50:45] and all religions they do their due
[50:48] diligence. They go to church. They do
[50:50] their prayers. They do their sacrifices.
[50:52] If you're not a Christian, the they pray
[50:55] five times a day or something or they
[50:58] dress in holy garb clothes or they do
[51:01] some tradition of religion. That is not
[51:05] worship. That is works which is only
[51:08] visible to the eyes of men. That's the
[51:11] reason why most religious god-fearing
[51:15] people are frauds
[51:19] because they have a cloak of religion
[51:22] acting as if they believe in God for
[51:25] their own gain.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; That's not submission. That's not
[51:31] worship.
[51:33] That's works for men to see. Right? Then
[51:38] in truth, how do I submit in truth? In
[51:42] truth means not in the knowledge of man.
[51:47] So you can't submit to God with the
[51:50] knowledge that man can give you, right?
[51:54] Not by education.
[51:57] You're not going to be closer to God. In
[51:59] fact, the more educated you are, the
[52:01] further you get away from God. Because
[52:03] education today is going to lead you
[52:05] away from believing in God. It's going
[52:06] to tell you God doesn't exist and
[52:09] science proves this and science proves
[52:11] that and and uh quantum physics shows
[52:14] this and biology shows that and
[52:16] anthropology shows that and and uh
[52:18] paleontology shows that. The more you
[52:20] learn, the further and further you get
[52:22] away from believing in God. You cannot
[52:25] serve God. You cannot submit to him by
[52:27] education. Which is why most educated
[52:30] young people today expect to be
[52:32] convinced of God like the way the
[52:35] universities convince them. Show me
[52:38] evidence.
[52:43] You know
[52:46] almost all the evidence we have today is
[52:48] so small, so minute, it's so ridiculous.
[52:52] You know, I was I was talking to our our
[52:56] um family a few weeks ago.
[53:00] Um and you know, I was showing them if
[53:03] you take the Earth,
[53:07] uh let's say the Earth was I don't have
[53:08] a ball here, but let's say the Earth was
[53:10] that big, right? The furthest our
[53:13] satellites,
[53:15] okay? The furthest our satellites have
[53:17] moved outside of our Earth is that far.
[53:22] That far. Can you see?
[53:26] That far. We're not moving in space that
[53:29] far away.
[53:32] That means even all the pictures they
[53:34] show you of Earth is a projected image.
[53:36] We don't have the capacity to take that
[53:38] picture.
[53:41] And then they oh the web telescope and
[53:43] this telescope. No, those telescopes
[53:45] which have gone off in in a distance
[53:47] have to accumulate images that they get
[53:50] to form a picture. WE DON'T EVEN have
[53:53] the capacity to take a picture of the
[53:54] planet.
[53:56] But we sell the images to our kids.
[54:00] This is it. This is we can barely
[54:03] survive that much past the earth. And
[54:06] those people who do those jumps from
[54:09] space and whatever, can you can you
[54:11] imagine that's as far as we can get
[54:14] with this the great science today that
[54:17] proves God doesn't exist. That's as far
[54:20] as we can travel.
[54:25] That tells you how elaborate the lie has
[54:28] to be.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; See, to disprove God, you've got to
[54:32] create the most elaborate lie. And the
[54:35] amazing thing is we've got these
[54:36] screens, these HD pictures, these um
[54:39] amazing uh stories that people can come
[54:42] up with the story of life and
[54:44] paleontology and the dinosaurs. And we
[54:47] don't even have enough evidence on the
[54:49] dinosaurs to fully construct and know
[54:51] what an actual dinosaur fully looks
[54:53] like.
[54:55] There's so much of lie in there that
[54:57] creates the image. We use computer
[54:59] imaging, young people. Computer imaging.
[55:02] Oh, they use computer imaging. How does
[55:04] computer imaging work? THEY HAVE TO PUT
[55:07] DATA into the computer
[55:10] &gt;&gt; to form the image. If if you gave the
[55:13] computer the knowledge of God, would it
[55:15] form that image?
[55:18] &gt;&gt; So, how do you even know what the
[55:19] dinosaur if we don't tell them make it
[55:22] look lizardlike?
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; Make it have scales.
[55:27] The computer is a machine. It doesn't
[55:29] know what's feathers and scales and all
[55:30] of that. You've got to put in the data.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; Then put all your other stuff in. And
[55:37] then this this thing will make an image
[55:39] based on what you've programmed it to
[55:41] do.
[55:44] &gt;&gt; The rest is human imagination.
[55:47] Okay. So, we don't really know whether a
[55:50] T-Rex and why is it only found in North
[55:52] America where all the greatest liars
[55:54] are.
[55:57] Hey,
[56:00] the ones that fool the whole world. Why
[56:02] Why don't we find T-Rexes here? Why
[56:04] aren't we finding Diplodocus here in
[56:06] Africa? This is where all the big
[56:08] animals deserve to be. This continent,
[56:11] the big five. We should have an even
[56:13] bigger five somewhere else. No, no
[56:16] dinosaurs here.
[56:18] H Well, at least not like that. No, we
[56:20] get the the luxury of all the small
[56:22] minute fossils, you know.
[56:26] No people, it's what man put into the
[56:29] computer and what that's what spits it
[56:30] out.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Truth is not by the knowledge of man,
[56:34] not by traditions. You can't serve God
[56:36] in truth by fear for selfish reasons,
[56:40] not by histories.
[56:43] There's a new thing now in Christianity
[56:45] is all these scholars coming up studying
[56:47] the historical records. And every time
[56:50] you, like I always say, you kick a bush
[56:52] and another historian pops out and
[56:55] another expert pops out on the Bible and
[56:58] now and then you'll get this guy who
[57:00] refutes that guy and now the internet is
[57:02] filled with all these guys refuting each
[57:04] other AND THIS ONE DESTROYS this one,
[57:08] right? You know, with the glasses on.
[57:11] Yeah. He destroys them. This one
[57:12] destroys THIS ONE AND THIS ONE DESTROYS
[57:14] this one. Who's telling us the truth?
[57:17] who has the better knowledge of the
[57:19] recorded history. Now we have to prove
[57:21] which scrolls are authentic, what that
[57:23] writing says, who interpreted that
[57:26] writing and and transcribed into this
[57:28] one and what year this happened. And we
[57:30] can sit there for two hours and listen
[57:32] to these guys discussing about which
[57:35] year and what was done here and there.
[57:37] And when you're done with it, nobody
[57:38] knows what to believe.
[57:41] They have a vote, you know, like how
[57:43] many of you here in the audience believe
[57:44] in this guy and how many believe that
[57:46] this guy's argument was better and then
[57:48] they have these this like poll number
[57:50] that comes out you know the majority 80%
[57:53] believe this guy what then therefore he
[57:55] must be telling the truth
[57:57] because 80%
[58:01] no not even madeup philosophies but by
[58:05] the correct understanding
[58:07] brought only by faith in the revelation
[58:11] of God for your day. That's the only
[58:14] truth there can be.
[58:16] Okay, let's get a little bit more into
[58:17] that. You love him, saints.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; It was then revealed to us that the Lord
[58:22] Jesus was that spirit of God made flesh.
[58:29] That's what the Bible then tells us,
[58:30] right? Which was called the son. That is
[58:33] the son. The same spirit of God made
[58:36] flesh is called the son. So here's my
[58:39] question for all you geniuses,
[58:43] right, who've been following
[58:44] Christianity and the message for so
[58:48] long.
[58:50] What is a spirit?
[58:57] Can anyone sitting here with red blood
[58:59] and gray cells upstairs, I hope, explain
[59:03] to me in plain English what is a spirit?
[59:09] Use some intellectual articulation
[59:12] to tell me what a spirit is.
[59:19] Oh, but we say amen. Worship him in
[59:22] spirit, brother.
[59:25] What is a spirit?
[59:27] H we can barely explain it.
[59:31] Try it. I did. Gets me nowhere. For some
[59:35] reason, WE HAVE JUST ACCEPTED it as
[59:38] being something real. And some of us
[59:41] even have an imagination of it. I I
[59:43] guarantee you, if I ask the children,
[59:45] they'll start giving me answers like
[59:46] this. You older people will fumble
[59:49] because you don't want to be wrong.
[59:51] Children will tell you, "Spirit is like,
[59:53] if I ask the children, what color is the
[59:55] spirit?" It'll be white, like a mist, be
[59:57] like LIKE LIKE SMOKE INSIDE A PERSON.
[1:00:01] THEY'LL COME UP WITH ANSWERS. THEY'LL
[1:00:03] TELL exactly what they think. That's
[1:00:05] what children do. But you and I will be
[1:00:09] very reserved to say because we don't
[1:00:11] want to be wrong.
[1:00:13] Right? But nobody I know can tell us
[1:00:15] exactly what it is and neither can I.
[1:00:18] The word spirit can be used in many.
[1:00:21] This is amazing. Right? This this one
[1:00:23] word we have no idea of is the one word
[1:00:26] running right through from the beginning
[1:00:28] from Genesis through Revelation. WE JUST
[1:00:30] AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO AS CHRISTIANS.
[1:00:32] WE'VE GOT THESE WORDS there and we just
[1:00:35] skirt around it. We don't want to talk
[1:00:38] about what it is, right? The word spirit
[1:00:41] can be used in many contexts and does
[1:00:44] not mean the same thing at every time.
[1:00:46] Right? Like the spirit that is God is
[1:00:50] not the same as being in the spirit.
[1:00:54] And this is like you know from the
[1:00:57] debacle of Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit
[1:01:03] you know that that that we just went
[1:01:05] through I went through it's LIKE YOU
[1:01:07] WOULD NEVER say uh because it's the
[1:01:10] selfsame word now right you can never
[1:01:13] say in book of revelations JOHN WAS IN
[1:01:15] THE GHOST on the Lord's day
[1:01:21] you can't say that but they're the
[1:01:23] selfsame
[1:01:24] How was John in the ghost? You would
[1:01:27] never say that. It just doesn't mean the
[1:01:29] same thing. And yet in the Greek, it's
[1:01:32] exactly the same word, numa.
[1:01:35] And then the very English, I want to
[1:01:37] show you this. Do you see here the
[1:01:39] English translators wrote, "God is a
[1:01:41] spirit, capital S, and you must worship
[1:01:44] him in spirit, lowercase S."
[1:01:47] The translators thought they understood
[1:01:50] something, which is why they did all
[1:01:51] that. Even the words Holy Spirit in the
[1:01:54] in the Bible, they don't always use it
[1:01:56] with capital S. Even the word spirit
[1:01:59] whenever there's some reasoning behind
[1:02:02] when they transcribed it, they
[1:02:04] recognized this was a different meaning,
[1:02:06] but they only had one word to express it
[1:02:08] by.
[1:02:10] So God is not the spirit of God is not
[1:02:14] the same as being in the spirit. One is
[1:02:17] referring to one is referring to the
[1:02:19] very essence of his being and the other
[1:02:23] is referring to the anointing of his
[1:02:25] word.
[1:02:29] Right? Now God is a spirit. Therefore we
[1:02:33] have to worship him in spirit. Now I
[1:02:36] want to ask this question. How can we as
[1:02:39] humans who are limited by three
[1:02:41] dimensions of light, matter and time?
[1:02:44] How do we even submit to something we
[1:02:47] cannot see, you cannot hear, you cannot
[1:02:50] touch, and you cannot understand?
[1:02:53] How do we submit to it in truth if we
[1:02:56] cannot? How do we submit to God whom we
[1:02:59] cannot see, we cannot hear, we cannot
[1:03:02] touch, we cannot understand? It's
[1:03:04] literally impossible for a normal human
[1:03:07] to do. So for you to do that in some way
[1:03:10] by yourself, you have to create an image
[1:03:14] in your mind or an understanding to
[1:03:17] which you can say I would like to follow
[1:03:19] that understanding.
[1:03:21] That's the only way because you can't
[1:03:24] see the spirit of God. You can't touch
[1:03:26] it. You can't see it. You can't
[1:03:28] understand it. You can't hear it.
[1:03:32] Right? For generations,
[1:03:36] uh this has happened. We will
[1:03:37] immediately though. So here's here's the
[1:03:40] thing. If I ask you to tell me what you
[1:03:44] think the spirit of God is, I ask you
[1:03:46] how many people are here. Probably about
[1:03:48] a 100 people. I don't know. We'll come
[1:03:50] up with a hundred different
[1:03:52] descriptions.
[1:03:54] Right
[1:03:55] now, who's is right?
[1:03:59] Whose image whose imagination is the
[1:04:02] best?
[1:04:04] And it's not someone who can draw it
[1:04:06] better. Someone with a greater
[1:04:08] imagination can come up with something
[1:04:10] really creative but absolutely wrong.
[1:04:13] That's just how it is right now. So in
[1:04:16] other words, we will all make the
[1:04:17] mistake of imagining something in our
[1:04:19] personal imaginations which will then
[1:04:22] conflict with someone else's
[1:04:23] imagination. You agree? So for
[1:04:26] generations, we have been satisfied. We
[1:04:28] satisfied ourselves believing that God
[1:04:31] is some kind of spiritual being that
[1:04:33] lives outside of our planet from where
[1:04:38] he controls earth.
[1:04:40] Is that roundabout correct?
[1:04:44] Cuz where does God live?
[1:04:46] From all that we showed you, all those
[1:04:48] pictures. I just showed you three
[1:04:50] pictures. Okay, you with me?
[1:04:53] There are thousands probably millions on
[1:04:56] the internet uh that that pictures of
[1:04:58] God.
[1:05:00] Okay. So, do you believe that God lives
[1:05:03] here
[1:05:05] in this air?
[1:05:07] Am I slapping him right now?
[1:05:12] Does he live inside us in the ground?
[1:05:16] above us in the clouds in space in
[1:05:20] another galaxy.
[1:05:22] Does it contain his spirit? How big is
[1:05:25] his spirit? How small is his spirit?
[1:05:30] H So for generations, so whatever you
[1:05:34] you think you come up with in your mind,
[1:05:36] that's what you're going to submit to.
[1:05:38] Right? Now, some of us believe he's this
[1:05:41] invisible spirit that he's so big. He's
[1:05:45] the creator of the universe. Certainly,
[1:05:46] he cannot live within our atmosphere.
[1:05:48] His home must be beyond the clouds. And
[1:05:51] we've got scriptures to say that.
[1:05:55] We do not comprehend the abstract
[1:05:58] reality of the word spirit. That's the
[1:06:00] reason why none of us can explain it
[1:06:01] because you can't comprehend it.
[1:06:04] We don't know what its essence is. We
[1:06:06] don't know what it looks like. We don't
[1:06:08] know what a spirit looks like. We cannot
[1:06:10] even imagine its reality. We believe it
[1:06:13] exists because we believe that, wait for
[1:06:16] it, that we have a spirit.
[1:06:21] And that this life inside our bodies is
[1:06:24] our spirit. How many of you here believe
[1:06:26] you have a spirit? You can raise your
[1:06:28] hands.
[1:06:30] Huh? Or what? Do you have some battery
[1:06:33] life source stuck in your kidney
[1:06:35] somewhere? Like, do you have a spirit?
[1:06:38] And then when you die and you breathe
[1:06:40] your last breath
[1:06:42] and the body dies and the spirit leaves
[1:06:46] and every one of you believes you have a
[1:06:49] spirit.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. So what does your spirit look
[1:06:53] like?
[1:06:55] Where does your spirit reside? There's
[1:06:58] no air inside there. I hope so. What's
[1:07:02] it? It's moving through your
[1:07:03] bloodstream.
[1:07:05] Where does your spirit live? in a cavity
[1:07:06] in your heart or in your brain.
[1:07:10] Where where IS THE SPIRIT? DESCRIBE IT.
[1:07:13] HOW DOES IT LEAVE YOUR BODY? IS YOUR
[1:07:15] THIS IS why the Jewish people came up
[1:07:17] with that ru the spirit is the breath.
[1:07:21] So what? Every time you breathe in and
[1:07:24] out, your spirit is like,
[1:07:29] huh? That's your spirit. Remember I told
[1:07:32] you why you say bless you when there's a
[1:07:33] sneeze. Chew. BECAUSE YOUR SPIRIT GOES
[1:07:36] OUT AND YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "BLESS YOU
[1:07:37] BEFORE THE DEVIL CATCHES IT."
[1:07:41] Thank the Germans for that.
[1:07:45] That's the best thing they came up
[1:07:47] besides Mercedes-Benz.
[1:07:53] The closest we can do to understanding
[1:07:55] what a spirit is is something we call
[1:07:58] nature.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:01] That's the closest thing in that God
[1:08:05] would therefore be the mysterious divine
[1:08:08] nature even though we cannot explain it.
[1:08:11] That's the only word we have that's
[1:08:13] closest right and we feel satisfied
[1:08:16] knowing at least that the spirit of
[1:08:19] something is the nature of it somehow.
[1:08:22] Are you with me? Amen.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; So we know there are so many places in
[1:08:26] the message where the proverb tells us
[1:08:28] that the soul is the nature of the
[1:08:30] spirit.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Now here's that other word soul.
[1:08:35] Who knows what that is? So if you had to
[1:08:38] go into I don't know the dictionary or
[1:08:41] like most of us today maybe the internet
[1:08:44] and you searched up what spirit is.
[1:08:46] Don't do it now please listen to me. Or
[1:08:48] you or you look at soul and what soul is
[1:08:50] they tell you that soul is believed to
[1:08:52] be the eternal part of the human
[1:08:55] essence. And the spirit is kind of like
[1:08:57] the seat of emotions and desires and
[1:09:00] that kind of thing. Even that what does
[1:09:02] that mean? It's still abstract. It
[1:09:05] doesn't look like reality to us. Are you
[1:09:08] with me?
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; IT SEEMS LIKE SOUL AND spirit are
[1:09:11] connected.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; So how do we know this? Because you look
[1:09:14] at Moses' tabernacle, the outer court is
[1:09:18] one room. That's like the body with the
[1:09:21] the brass alt and the brazen labor. And
[1:09:23] then you go in and then there's one room
[1:09:26] with a veil. So the the spirit is like
[1:09:31] the inner court where the seven golden
[1:09:32] candlesticks, the table of showbread,
[1:09:34] the altar of incense, and you go behind
[1:09:36] the veil and there is the ark of the
[1:09:38] covenant with the shikina presence of
[1:09:39] God and that would be the soul, right?
[1:09:43] But then it's one room. If you remove
[1:09:46] the veil, the two rooms become one room.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Soul and spirit are actually one.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; So the nature of the spirit is actually
[1:09:56] from the soul. And the spirit takes the
[1:09:59] nature and transmits the nature to the
[1:10:02] rest of the body.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Whatever nature is in there is what
[1:10:06] sanctifies the body. Whatever nature is
[1:10:09] in there is what makes what is sanctify
[1:10:11] to make holy to consecrate. In other
[1:10:14] words, the spirit takes the nature from
[1:10:17] the soul and makes the body work for the
[1:10:20] soul
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; for the nature that governs it.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; that's how it works,
[1:10:26] right? So somehow the spirit is
[1:10:29] something that pulls from the source of
[1:10:32] the nature that is inside to make the
[1:10:34] body do what its nature defines. Are you
[1:10:38] with me?
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; So
[1:10:42] if you speak in a certain way, where's
[1:10:45] that coming from?
[1:10:47] The a nature that's been put inside.
[1:10:50] Right? If you speak like an intellectual
[1:10:53] person, it means you've been feeding
[1:10:55] your soul with intellectualism,
[1:10:57] with education. If you speak like a
[1:11:00] gangster, well, there's no mystery where
[1:11:03] you got your education from,
[1:11:06] right?
[1:11:08] Because you want to be cool. went to cap
[1:11:10] on backwards, your pants hanging down,
[1:11:12] socks with holes, pants with holes,
[1:11:15] t-shirts with all kinds of
[1:11:16] paraphernalia, hook here, ring there,
[1:11:19] tattoo this way, hair shaved off this
[1:11:21] side, and and and you stand next to
[1:11:23] someone who's a professor of, I don't
[1:11:25] know, philosophy, dressed in a
[1:11:26] three-piece suit, standing there with
[1:11:28] his checkered hat on and his bow tie.
[1:11:30] Two human beings,
[1:11:33] two different souls.
[1:11:36] The body's expression is what's inside
[1:11:38] the soul.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; The body is submitting to what nature is
[1:11:42] inside
[1:11:44] this. You take the same person and you
[1:11:47] change the nature in the soul and the
[1:11:49] entire body adapts.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; You take that same person with his pants
[1:11:54] hanging down, cap on backwards, smoking
[1:11:56] a cigarette, tattoos, all that stuff,
[1:11:59] rings here, poked there, speaking bad
[1:12:02] language, and bring him to Christ. His
[1:12:04] nature changes. His body falls in line
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; because his spirit contacts the nature
[1:12:11] and transmits it to the body and the
[1:12:13] body then takes the identification
[1:12:16] of the nature that is inside.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; That's as much as we can understand and
[1:12:22] we know this because and all humans know
[1:12:24] this. Some people I know philosophers
[1:12:26] right now will say you know they'll come
[1:12:28] at me with all this education and
[1:12:30] philosophy and say no this is not what
[1:12:32] it is. This is what it can. We know this
[1:12:34] because we literally do this to
[1:12:35] children.
[1:12:39] I mean, you come out all baby goooo gaga
[1:12:42] knowing nothing. Mama, dada, you know
[1:12:45] nothing. We take you at 5 years old,
[1:12:47] stick you in a school and brainwash you
[1:12:49] every day and teach you and put you
[1:12:51] through the pain of holding a pen and
[1:12:53] teaching you to write. We inscribe it in
[1:12:55] your brain. We teach you education by
[1:12:58] association. We teach you the word cow
[1:13:00] and show you a picture. So we implant
[1:13:03] that picture in your head and the word
[1:13:05] in your head. And now when you say cow,
[1:13:07] you see it. How did we do it? We
[1:13:08] brainwashed you.
[1:13:11] We made you repeat it. We showed you
[1:13:13] place cards. Cow and is then for two.
[1:13:18] Mom, dad, fish,
[1:13:21] planting, planting, planting, planting.
[1:13:23] We put it into you. That's why you can
[1:13:26] speak. That's why we can communicate
[1:13:27] with you. That's why you can read books.
[1:13:30] And it doesn't stop there because then
[1:13:32] we send you to high school where we
[1:13:33] indoctrinate you and brainwash you even
[1:13:35] more. Then we send you to university and
[1:13:38] then after you get to WORK THEN THE JOB
[1:13:40] sends you somewhere. It doesn't stop
[1:13:42] till you old and retired and then you
[1:13:44] realize what in the world do I know
[1:13:46] about anything.
[1:13:51] H
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; let's dump all that and go fishing. You
[1:13:55] should have went fishing at the start,
[1:13:56] man. Yeah.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; A nature to us can only be defined as a
[1:14:06] set of characteristics or attributes
[1:14:09] that causes a being like you to behave
[1:14:12] in a certain way. Like you'll say that
[1:14:15] guy is a really honest person. That
[1:14:19] person is very aggressive. That guy is a
[1:14:21] liar. That guy is rude. That one is
[1:14:24] aggressive. That one is jealous. Why are
[1:14:26] you saying that? Because the way they're
[1:14:29] responding to life is identifying a
[1:14:32] certain nature that you know of.
[1:14:36] Right? So religions have taught us
[1:14:39] identifiable characteristics that define
[1:14:43] God according to them.
[1:14:47] The same way we identify humans. So if I
[1:14:49] ask you right now, can you describe the
[1:14:52] nature of God to me? And this is what
[1:14:54] religions have done. Humans have been
[1:14:56] made to believe that characteristics of
[1:14:58] God is being good, righteous, loving,
[1:15:04] kind, caring, wise, knowing all things,
[1:15:09] supernatural, and so much more. If you
[1:15:12] add judge, anger, they don't like that
[1:15:15] one.
[1:15:18] Judging the sin, they don't like that
[1:15:20] one, right? So God must be loving. Have
[1:15:23] you seen Christians today? bunch of
[1:15:24] wimps. God must be a love. God of love.
[1:15:28] He's so accepting. He must accept
[1:15:29] everybody. You can only don't even read
[1:15:32] the Bible. You just come in here with
[1:15:34] your hair colored purple and your shorts
[1:15:36] on backwards AND DO WHATEVER YOU FEEL
[1:15:38] LIKE. GOD IS A GOD OF LOVE. Come in.
[1:15:41] That's God. That's lies.
[1:15:47] We have been told that if something does
[1:15:49] not match those identifiable
[1:15:51] characterist and listen every church
[1:15:53] denomination has a certain set of
[1:15:55] characteristics that they say God is
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; God loves worship. So you get these one,
[1:16:00] some churches, the whole service is just
[1:16:03] drums, bass guitars, singing songs,
[1:16:05] craziness because God loves worship. And
[1:16:07] then they read a psalm and preach for 15
[1:16:10] minutes and they talk about politics and
[1:16:13] jokes. And that's the church service.
[1:16:14] All right, see you. Don't forget to buy
[1:16:16] something at our coffee shop on your way
[1:16:17] out. God bless you. See you next week.
[1:16:19] Don't forget to pay your tithe and your
[1:16:20] money and your offerings. We're good to
[1:16:22] go. WE'LL SEE YOU IN HEAVEN SOMEDAY.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; That's church today. It's a joke.
[1:16:29] And people cannot even listen to the
[1:16:32] word for 20 minutes.
[1:16:36] You say you believe in God but you can't
[1:16:37] hear his word.
[1:16:41] We have been told that if those
[1:16:44] identifiable characteristics if it
[1:16:46] doesn't match that it's not God. So
[1:16:48] every church, every religion has its
[1:16:50] idea of the identifiable
[1:16:52] characteristics.
[1:16:54] So we've what do we call it today? We
[1:16:56] call it godliness.
[1:16:58] Right? We have taught people that this
[1:17:00] is what God is. So we do this too. So
[1:17:04] you got people in the message. If you
[1:17:06] had the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't do
[1:17:08] that.
[1:17:09] If you had the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't
[1:17:11] talk like that. You wouldn't say this.
[1:17:13] You wouldn't act this way. You wouldn't
[1:17:14] really,
[1:17:18] you know, I just been through something
[1:17:20] this week.
[1:17:22] I just had a man who I don't know, he
[1:17:24] saw some Tik Tok video of me. And
[1:17:26] listen, I don't make the Tik Tok videos.
[1:17:27] I don't know who does.
[1:17:30] And they put these slogans on there
[1:17:31] which are not even my words like the one
[1:17:34] that was was there said uh it's it's a
[1:17:37] Tik Tok of me. They took it from a video
[1:17:40] and they put there that I said a prophet
[1:17:42] like no other. I didn't even say that.
[1:17:46] I was speaking about the prophet's
[1:17:48] ministry and I said his ministry was
[1:17:50] like no other prophet. And I explained
[1:17:52] that he went through two world wars and
[1:17:55] rock and roll and mass-produced drugs
[1:17:57] and alcohol. And then I came to the
[1:17:59] point where I said not even Jesus had to
[1:18:01] go through that.
[1:18:03] Guy told me I'm a blasphemer,
[1:18:05] right? And uh that I shouldn't even uh
[1:18:08] be doing I didn't even say what he's
[1:18:10] saying I was saying, right?
[1:18:13] But and then he told me um you're a good
[1:18:15] minister but you know you uh I don't see
[1:18:19] the spirit of Christ in you in the way
[1:18:21] you speak like you you shouldn't speak
[1:18:23] that way and mock somebody or laugh you
[1:18:26] know at the denominations like that. I
[1:18:27] said, "Uh, excuse me. If you heard
[1:18:30] Christ speak
[1:18:34] and if I had to speak like him, if I had
[1:18:36] to come out here and say,
[1:18:37] "Denominations, you are hypocrites. You
[1:18:39] are vipers. You are asked, you are
[1:18:41] snakes IN THE GRASS, YOU ARE OF YOUR
[1:18:43] FATHER, THE DEVIL.
[1:18:45] I have never even spoken like that." So,
[1:18:49] what's your idea of how Christ speaks?
[1:18:51] See, loving, kind, gentle,
[1:18:55] understanding, non-judgmental.
[1:19:01] That's God. God loves everyone.
[1:19:05] That already sounds to me like the CIA
[1:19:07] got a spotlight on me, you know, like uh
[1:19:10] uh brainwashing me for something.
[1:19:14] But then we found that evil people are
[1:19:17] able TO DISPLAY THESE CHARACTERISTICS AS
[1:19:20] WELL.
[1:19:21] AS ANY OTHER REGULAR PERSON,
[1:19:25] psychopaths
[1:19:27] can be very kind, loving, gentle until
[1:19:29] they kill you.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; If nature's was so easily discernable,
[1:19:36] then every person ought to with ease be
[1:19:40] able to tell what is the difference
[1:19:42] between God and the devil.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Why? Why are more humans not able? There
[1:19:48] are people who worshiping God but don't
[1:19:50] realize they're worshiping the devil.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; So unfortunately the truth is it's not
[1:19:58] that easily discernable anymore. It
[1:20:01] should have been but we've done things
[1:20:03] to ourselves that make it impossible for
[1:20:06] us to even discern good and evil.
[1:20:10] So what is the most Are you with me?
[1:20:13] What is the most explicitly
[1:20:17] identifiable characteristic
[1:20:20] about the spirit of God that we can
[1:20:23] identify can only be God
[1:20:28] truth?
[1:20:31] Some people say God is love because you
[1:20:34] see it in John. God is love and those
[1:20:36] who have love one another and so on. But
[1:20:38] even love is found in truth because love
[1:20:41] is perverted
[1:20:43] in today's world. You can pervert love
[1:20:45] into a whole lot of things. And even
[1:20:47] when they say God is love, what kind of
[1:20:49] love are you talking about?
[1:20:52] Because according to God's love, he'll
[1:20:54] chastise you when you're wrong. And when
[1:20:56] he chastises, chastises and gives you a
[1:20:58] weapon. Then you must accept it because
[1:21:01] you know that he loves you, right?
[1:21:04] Nobody wants that love, right? So the
[1:21:07] only identifiable characteristic that
[1:21:11] absolutely identifies the spirit of God
[1:21:13] is truth.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Because in him is truth and is no lie.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; All right, let's quickly go through it.
[1:21:22] Are you ready?
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; The spirit of truth. That's what we
[1:21:25] speaking about. Okay, here's scripture.
[1:21:27] In hope of eternal life, which God that
[1:21:30] cannot lie
[1:21:32] promised the world promised before the
[1:21:35] world began. Here's scripture telling
[1:21:36] you God cannot lie.
[1:21:40] That's his identifiable characteristic.
[1:21:42] Uh the second one, that by two immutable
[1:21:45] things in which it is impossible for God
[1:21:47] to lie, we might have a strong
[1:21:50] consolation who have fled for refuge to
[1:21:52] lay hold upon the hope set before us. It
[1:21:55] is impossible for God to lie. Agreed.
[1:21:59] uh John 14:17 even the spirit of truth
[1:22:04] whom the world cannot receive is is
[1:22:06] telling you the world does not even
[1:22:08] receive the spirit of truth the nature
[1:22:11] of truth
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; because it seeth him not means it
[1:22:14] doesn't understand him it neither know
[1:22:17] but you know him for he dwelleth with
[1:22:20] you and shall be in you
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; we did that recently right last week
[1:22:26] with you and shall be in you. John
[1:22:30] 15:26, when the comforter is come, whom
[1:22:32] I will send unto you from the father,
[1:22:34] even the spirit of truth which
[1:22:36] proceedth, it comes from God himself.
[1:22:39] THE HOLY SPIRIT, the spirit of truth, it
[1:22:41] it it COMES OUT FROM HIS VERY OWN
[1:22:43] NATURE.
[1:22:45] The Holy Spirit cannot speak a lie. The
[1:22:49] Holy Spirit cannot do something with
[1:22:51] people that produces a lie. The Holy
[1:22:53] Spirit cannot speak with tongues and
[1:22:55] that message is a lie. The Holy Spirit
[1:22:58] cannot preach a sermon and the sermon
[1:23:00] has a lie in it.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:08] Uh how be it when he the spirit of truth
[1:23:11] is come, he will guide you in all truth.
[1:23:13] This again speaking of the of the Holy
[1:23:15] Spirit. 1 John 4:6, we are of God. He
[1:23:19] that knoweth God heareth us. That means
[1:23:22] only those people who are also of God
[1:23:25] will be able to understand what we say
[1:23:28] and believe what we say. He that is not
[1:23:30] of God heareth not us. That's telling us
[1:23:33] he that is not of the truth cannot
[1:23:35] understand what we say. Hereby we know.
[1:23:39] THIS IS HOW WE KNOW THE SPIRIT OF TRUTH
[1:23:41] AND the spirit of error.
[1:23:43] Do you want you must take these
[1:23:45] scriptures, go back home and and study
[1:23:47] it out. Break it out. This is how we
[1:23:49] discern the spirit of truth and the
[1:23:51] spirit of error because we know if you
[1:23:54] are of God you will understand us. How?
[1:23:57] In in other words,
[1:23:59] let me say it this way. How do I know
[1:24:01] that you love me? This is how simple it
[1:24:04] is. Because when I tell you something,
[1:24:06] you believe me.
[1:24:09] That's the hardest thing to say.
[1:24:12] Remember I preached recently
[1:24:14] um well a few years ago to love someone
[1:24:18] means to believe in them.
[1:24:21] So if I tell you something and you look
[1:24:23] at me like nah I don't think so right
[1:24:27] like ah no I don't think you're telling
[1:24:29] me the truth. You don't believe me that
[1:24:31] proves you don't completely love me. You
[1:24:34] may have an idea of me. This is this is
[1:24:36] what marriage should be. This is what it
[1:24:39] should be between parents and children.
[1:24:42] Th this is what life should be where if
[1:24:44] you will truly love someone, you believe
[1:24:46] what they say. Like you don't have to I
[1:24:50] don't want to go back to that washing
[1:24:51] basket and the clothes, but go around
[1:24:54] and prove whether they told you the
[1:24:56] truth because FAITH MAKES YOU ACT ON
[1:25:00] WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
[1:25:03] See John 14:6
[1:25:06] uh to 10 Jesus said unto him, I am the
[1:25:09] way. Jesus now is saying, I am the way,
[1:25:13] the truth, and the life. Right? God is
[1:25:18] the is the spirit of truth. Is that
[1:25:20] right? God is a spirit when he the
[1:25:23] spirit of truth has come. And now JESUS
[1:25:24] IS SAYING, "I AM the way. I am the
[1:25:26] truth. I am the life. No man comes to
[1:25:30] God but by me.
[1:25:33] You will not even get to worship God
[1:25:37] unless you come through me. What does
[1:25:40] that mean? That's his word. What does IT
[1:25:42] MEAN? YOU HAVE TO RECEIVE the truth. And
[1:25:44] how did he say you shall receive the
[1:25:45] truth? My word is truth.
[1:25:49] Right? If you have known me, you should
[1:25:52] have known God the Father. From
[1:25:54] henceforth we know him and have seen
[1:25:55] him. From now on, from now on, he's
[1:25:58] telling the disciples, you have known
[1:25:59] him and have seen him. Who was he
[1:26:01] talking about? Himself. Philip said unto
[1:26:04] him, Lord, show us the father. What
[1:26:06] happened to Philip? Did you just doze
[1:26:07] off just now? Right. Uh, show us the
[1:26:11] father, Lord, and suffice it. And Jesus
[1:26:12] said unto him, have I been with you so
[1:26:14] long and just and yet hast thou not
[1:26:17] known me, Philillip? He hath he that
[1:26:19] hath seen me hath seen the father. If
[1:26:22] you seen me, if you understood me, if
[1:26:24] you know me, THEN YOU KNOW GOD. HOW
[1:26:27] SAYEST THOU, SHOW US THE FATHER?
[1:26:29] Believest thou not that I am in the
[1:26:31] Father, and the Father in me? The words
[1:26:33] that I speak are not of myself, but the
[1:26:35] Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[1:26:37] works. All right. So, I'm going to close
[1:26:39] this off quickly and get to the next
[1:26:40] part. So these are just a few scriptures
[1:26:43] saints among many that show us that if
[1:26:45] there is anything that can describe who
[1:26:48] God is today it is that word that
[1:26:51] fiveletter word truth
[1:26:55] which is so scarce today.
[1:26:59] Therefore who God really is to us in the
[1:27:02] world is the spirit of truth. Right
[1:27:05] Sunday school kids you listening
[1:27:08] truth. Remember sister Lena told you
[1:27:10] every time you want to do something
[1:27:12] there's that good voice and that naughty
[1:27:14] voice.
[1:27:16] Hey young people, you always know you
[1:27:20] don't need mommy, you don't need daddy,
[1:27:21] you don't need when there's your friend
[1:27:24] tells you to do something, there's a
[1:27:26] voice that's telling you I shouldn't do
[1:27:27] this and there's the other voice saying
[1:27:29] yeah do it MAN DO IT YOU WANT TO AND THE
[1:27:33] OTHER one is saying don't do it it's not
[1:27:35] right
[1:27:36] one is telling you truth the other one
[1:27:39] is telling you a lie
[1:27:41] and the spirit of God is
[1:27:44] truth truth.
[1:27:46] Okay, so here's the beauty part of this.
[1:27:50] Would we even have a word for truth if
[1:27:53] there were no lies introduced?
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Okay, so if there was no such thing as
[1:28:01] untruth or lies or error, we wouldn't
[1:28:04] even have to define truth. We would just
[1:28:06] know it and live with it and it's fine.
[1:28:09] Because this world is so overcome with
[1:28:11] lies and error. It is why truth has
[1:28:14] become so outstanding today. Okay. Now
[1:28:17] we're getting to the next part which is
[1:28:19] quite interesting. So before we get to
[1:28:21] that which is who is the devil.
[1:28:25] All right. It's amazing whenever I do
[1:28:28] this subject this is when people wake
[1:28:29] up.
[1:28:31] I went through God and some of them are
[1:28:33] yawning and tired. But when you talk
[1:28:34] about the devil it's like I need to know
[1:28:38] this.
[1:28:39] coffee,
[1:28:42] right? I'm just making light of it. I
[1:28:45] want you to get this before we go into
[1:28:48] this uh next part.
[1:28:51] This entire world right now is in a very
[1:28:54] sorry state. I I don't want to spend too
[1:28:57] much of time trying to describe how bad
[1:28:59] it is. Okay?
[1:29:01] Um, and I don't want to hurt anybody's
[1:29:04] feelings,
[1:29:10] but if you had to go to schools today
[1:29:13] and uh or anywhere,
[1:29:16] you are finding like at least 50% of any
[1:29:19] class with children whose parents are
[1:29:21] divorced
[1:29:23] or they hate their parents or they're
[1:29:26] having just troubles. Like you you
[1:29:28] cannot believe what little kids have to
[1:29:30] go through today. Uh going through life
[1:29:33] without parents, without uh fathers who
[1:29:35] care for the mothers and mothers who are
[1:29:37] cheating on the fathers or something.
[1:29:39] This is what life is becoming. And and
[1:29:41] the reason for everything from families
[1:29:44] to to children to societies breaking
[1:29:48] down into absolute evil is because there
[1:29:52] is no truth anymore being spoken.
[1:29:57] Right? And and and what is it? It is the
[1:30:00] devil.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, who is the devil?
[1:30:06] This is not the devil.
[1:30:10] See what we did back then? This is not
[1:30:13] the devil. This is also not the devil.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; The five star turned upside down has no
[1:30:21] power. Yes.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; I told you you can make it here on the
[1:30:24] floor with powder and put a goat's face
[1:30:28] in it and put candles in there. I'll go
[1:30:30] stand in there. It'll do nothing to me.
[1:30:32] I'll stand in there, jump around and
[1:30:34] sing happy birthday and it will do
[1:30:36] nothing to me.
[1:30:39] I'll stamp on it, spray water on it,
[1:30:42] laugh at it, shout at it, do anything.
[1:30:45] It'll do nothing. It's got zero power.
[1:30:48] It's not even evil. It's just a star
[1:30:50] turned upside down.
[1:30:53] It's only made evil because men have
[1:30:55] told you stories about it.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; EVEN A CROSS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN, it's
[1:31:02] just a cross. Whether it's right side
[1:31:04] up, sideways, or upside down, it's got
[1:31:07] no power. Even a cross standing the
[1:31:11] right way has no power.
[1:31:14] That whole idea of keeping off vampires,
[1:31:17] the wooden cross, turn upside down, you
[1:31:20] know, the spirits of demons in the night
[1:31:22] and a cross to show them THE CROSS AND
[1:31:23] HAVE THE BIBLE with a cross ON IT UNDER
[1:31:25] YOUR PILLOW. It'll keep give you good
[1:31:27] dreams. Lies,
[1:31:32] this fellow
[1:31:34] Baffomet,
[1:31:36] that's not Satan. That's not the devil.
[1:31:39] That's a legend which comes from the
[1:31:41] goat that was turned loose in the hills
[1:31:43] that carried all the sins. They
[1:31:45] sprinkled on him the blood and they let
[1:31:47] him off and the villagers one they would
[1:31:49] expect they send him off into the desert
[1:31:51] and hope the goat dies one day the goat
[1:31:53] comes back he survives somehow and there
[1:31:55] he comes back WITH ALL THE SINS
[1:31:58] THE devil
[1:32:00] baff
[1:32:02] poor goats I love goat milk
[1:32:07] and goat meat goat curry Indians good
[1:32:11] stuff it's not devil
[1:32:14] well you know he can give you a good
[1:32:15] kick once in a while, but that's about
[1:32:18] it.
[1:32:19] Why must the devil choose the head of a
[1:32:21] goat?
[1:32:23] Children, do not be afraid of this
[1:32:26] nonsense.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Okay, this is nonsense.
[1:32:31] The same way they gave you the nonsense
[1:32:33] about God that we showed you in the
[1:32:34] beginning, this is all nonsense. You can
[1:32:37] keep a goat as a pet,
[1:32:40] okay? It's not a very good pet. He'll be
[1:32:43] climbing all your furniture and, you
[1:32:45] know, kicking things down. Okay, so the
[1:32:47] devil is definitely not Let's I don't
[1:32:50] know.
[1:32:53] Let's get him off the screen.
[1:32:56] The devil is not a green skinned or
[1:32:59] red-skinned creature with wings,
[1:33:04] right? And I don't I don't understand.
[1:33:06] If he lives under the ground, what's he
[1:33:08] doing with wings?
[1:33:11] Oh, he needs to fly into the
[1:33:14] universe somewhere and talk to God once
[1:33:16] in a while. So, he needs wings.
[1:33:19] He does not have horns and a tail. He
[1:33:22] does not have a three-pronged fork. He
[1:33:25] does not live under the ground IN MELTED
[1:33:27] BURNING LAVA AND ROCKS AND shouting
[1:33:31] waiting for you to come.
[1:33:34] He does not have powerful symbols like
[1:33:37] five-pointed star or I don't know all
[1:33:39] the ank or the Egyptian or the eye of
[1:33:42] Ral Osiris or whoever. He doesn't have
[1:33:46] all THAT. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT FALCONS
[1:33:48] AND DOGS AND CATS OF THE UNDERWORLD.
[1:33:52] These symbols only have power because
[1:33:56] people told you stories and gave power
[1:34:00] to it to control you.
[1:34:04] to control loving people
[1:34:08] and make others fear them.
[1:34:11] All right. So, who is Lucifer? That's
[1:34:14] where we want to get to. Firstly, let's
[1:34:16] understand this devil. You know, poor
[1:34:19] guy. We give him all the blame. Devil
[1:34:22] did this. Devil did this. You did it.
[1:34:23] But you say the devil did it. See, this
[1:34:25] is the problem I have with it.
[1:34:27] Christians offer often refer to the
[1:34:29] devil as Lucifer. Okay? And uh he was
[1:34:33] only called Lucifer in the book of
[1:34:34] Isaiah one time in the whole Bible.
[1:34:37] Christians as well as the prophet used
[1:34:39] the name Lucifer in the Bible because
[1:34:41] the parable is speaking of a heavenly
[1:34:44] being cast down to earth. So what was
[1:34:47] his name in heaven? Was his name really
[1:34:49] Lucifer? No, we don't even know. But he
[1:34:53] was an angel
[1:34:55] of God who worked for God according to
[1:34:58] all the legends. And he was not the
[1:35:00] devil then. So then he was cast down to
[1:35:03] earth and became the devil. I don't want
[1:35:04] to go through that whole story again,
[1:35:05] but you remember it. And there he lived
[1:35:08] for some time in a body of flesh with
[1:35:11] his fellow fallen angels. When his
[1:35:13] fellow angels began to destroy earth,
[1:35:15] God reconstructed the earth and came the
[1:35:18] days of creation and uh redid the earth
[1:35:21] because they made it without form and
[1:35:22] void. And this condition where they live
[1:35:25] now with because they lost their bodies
[1:35:27] and became spirits
[1:35:31] and now we call that hell. The existence
[1:35:34] they live in the fifth dimension is a
[1:35:36] spirit. A body without or a spirit and a
[1:35:39] soul without or a spirit without a body.
[1:35:41] Is that right? So Lucifer does not exist
[1:35:45] anymore by that name. Lucifer is not the
[1:35:48] real current understanding of the devil.
[1:35:52] If Lucifer was his real name, then it
[1:35:55] was his name when he was an angel and a
[1:35:57] respected angel,
[1:36:00] right? Angel of light
[1:36:03] and then fell because it means morning
[1:36:05] star. That doesn't really make him sound
[1:36:08] like a devil, DOES IT?
[1:36:10] AND THEN apparently he became Satan. And
[1:36:13] that name Lucifer now has no power at
[1:36:16] all, you know. Uh it's a it's a lie.
[1:36:19] I've I've seen many people in South
[1:36:21] Africa, many friends, they had a black
[1:36:23] cat, they named it Lucifer. They had a
[1:36:24] black dog, they named it Lucifer.
[1:36:27] Like, why would you even do that? I even
[1:36:28] had another friend who named his dog
[1:36:30] Satan.
[1:36:36] Humans, I tell you, we're the best. It's
[1:36:39] a lie to make us live in fear. That's
[1:36:41] what they want. That's why they they're
[1:36:42] doing this. It's like who would want to
[1:36:44] go to a house where the dog is named
[1:36:45] Satan
[1:36:47] or a cat for that?
[1:36:50] OKAY. SO, WHO IS SATAN THEN? The name
[1:36:52] Satan is actually a Chaldian Canaanitish
[1:36:57] word which means adversary or enemy.
[1:37:02] Right?
[1:37:04] But if you walk around in South Africa
[1:37:05] and you go to the CHURCHES HERE THAT
[1:37:07] SATAN I JOY YOU COME OUT OF HIM. SATAN
[1:37:11] SATAN THIS AND THAT.
[1:37:14] HM. He gave that word so much of power.
[1:37:17] It only means enemy, adversary, right?
[1:37:21] And it became adopted as his name by
[1:37:24] humans because he became the spirit of
[1:37:26] evil and became known as the enemy of
[1:37:30] man. So even today, if I tell you the
[1:37:33] same test we did in the beginning, close
[1:37:35] your eyes and tell me what the devil
[1:37:37] looks like, those pictures is what
[1:37:39] you'll come up with. You got nothing
[1:37:41] else.
[1:37:42] Right? And he became known as the enemy
[1:37:45] of man. Satan is the enemy of man. Okay?
[1:37:48] So the correct pronunciation
[1:37:51] of Satan is shan in the Chelian and and
[1:37:56] Middle Eastern languages, right? But
[1:37:58] where is the first time that the word
[1:38:01] Satan is mentioned in the Bible? It's in
[1:38:03] 1 Chronicles 21:1.
[1:38:07] Then it says, "And Satan stood up
[1:38:09] against Israel."
[1:38:11] How did Satan stand up against Israel?
[1:38:15] He provoked David to number Israel.
[1:38:19] So at first when you when you read and
[1:38:21] Satan stood up against Israel, what does
[1:38:22] that make you think? This devil standing
[1:38:25] up like that, right? And he's uh he's um
[1:38:30] showing himself to Israel and he's
[1:38:32] coming against them with some kind of
[1:38:33] force,
[1:38:35] right? That's what you're kind of
[1:38:36] imagining. But that's not what's
[1:38:38] happening. All Satan is doing here is a
[1:38:43] nature came into David to make him
[1:38:46] number the armies of Israel to make a
[1:38:50] head count of how many soldiers and
[1:38:54] chariots and horses he had.
[1:38:58] That was Satan.
[1:39:00] the spirit that came into David to make
[1:39:04] him trust in numbers.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; This wasn't some shadowy
[1:39:10] shadow creature rising over Israel and
[1:39:14] and something coming to David and coming
[1:39:16] into his dream and saying, "You need to
[1:39:20] number Israel."
[1:39:23] No,
[1:39:25] this is David being insecure somehow or
[1:39:30] his souls or pride coming up in him. And
[1:39:34] that in itself was an enemy of God, an
[1:39:38] enemy of faith to place your faith in
[1:39:40] numbers.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Some of you thinking, "No, no, no. Come
[1:39:44] on, brother Alistister." Okay, I'll show
[1:39:45] you another one.
[1:39:47] You remember when Christ was telling the
[1:39:49] disciples
[1:39:51] how that
[1:39:53] Christ has to be arrested and and uh
[1:39:57] crucified and killed and scourged.
[1:40:01] And you know the person who uh said to
[1:40:04] him, "No, Lord, we're never going to let
[1:40:07] you do that. We're that's never going to
[1:40:08] happen. We will protect you. We will
[1:40:10] prevent this from happening." That man
[1:40:12] was Peter, the one who in Matthew 16
[1:40:16] just verses earlier said, "Thou art the
[1:40:19] Christ, the son of the living God." And
[1:40:21] Christ just told him, "Flesh and blood
[1:40:24] had not revealed this to you, but my
[1:40:25] father which is in heaven." That's
[1:40:26] Matthew 16:16-18.
[1:40:30] Now we go to the same chapter, verse 23.
[1:40:33] And Jesus said this to Peter. He turned
[1:40:36] and said unto Peter, "Get thee behind
[1:40:38] me, Satan.
[1:40:42] Thou art an offense. An offense mean a
[1:40:44] stumbling block to my purpose.
[1:40:47] For thou savorest not the things that be
[1:40:49] of God, but those that are be of the
[1:40:51] same man to whom flesh and blood had not
[1:40:54] revealed this great mystery of the
[1:40:56] Christ. Like a few verses later, Christ
[1:41:00] is saying to him, "Get thee behind me,
[1:41:02] Satan."
[1:41:05] You see, see what we've made of Satan
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; and what it really is. Satan just means
[1:41:11] the adversary of God, the enemy of God's
[1:41:14] purpose. What was Peter trying to do
[1:41:17] with Peter's natural mentality? Lord, I
[1:41:21] don't want you to die. I don't want you
[1:41:22] to be crucified. I don't want them to
[1:41:23] arrest you. I don't want them to scourge
[1:41:25] you. But Christ is telling him, this is
[1:41:28] what must come of the son of man. And
[1:41:30] Peter in his heart wants to stop that.
[1:41:32] Meaning he was becoming adversarial
[1:41:35] to God's purpose. He was standing in the
[1:41:38] way of the son of man being crucified.
[1:41:40] And that's why Christ said to him, "Get
[1:41:43] behind me, Satan."
[1:41:46] Incredible, isn't it?
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; So even by saying that, it does not mean
[1:41:49] that Peter was evil. It doesn't mean
[1:41:51] Peter was possessed of a devil. He just
[1:41:53] had the father reveal something to him.
[1:41:58] And we know it continues with Peter
[1:41:59] because then when they come to to arrest
[1:42:02] Christ, Peter pulls out his sword and
[1:42:04] cuts off Melchus's ear and fights trying
[1:42:07] to prevent them from arresting Christ.
[1:42:08] He should have just learned from this
[1:42:10] and stood back and said, "Well, it looks
[1:42:12] like it's time.
[1:42:14] We are believing. Lord, go. We'll follow
[1:42:17] you." That's what he should have said.
[1:42:19] And then Christ takes Melus's ear off
[1:42:22] the ground. What are you doing? Puts it
[1:42:25] back. heals his ear,
[1:42:28] right? Being adversarial to the word of
[1:42:32] God is a lot more complex than just
[1:42:35] being an evil person.
[1:42:38] In other words, Satan is a lot more
[1:42:41] subtle than you think.
[1:42:44] Doing something that goes against God's
[1:42:47] purpose is what really Satan is.
[1:42:50] So, how can we define the devil?
[1:42:54] Simply this,
[1:42:56] the devil is the spirit of lies, the
[1:42:58] father of lies, a lying spirit. That's
[1:43:01] what it is. As God is a spirit of truth,
[1:43:06] Sunday school kids, the devil is what?
[1:43:09] The spirit of lies.
[1:43:13] There's God and the devil that you can
[1:43:15] know today.
[1:43:18] So if God would be the spirit of truth,
[1:43:21] then only the only way the devil can be
[1:43:23] properly identified in his life. So in
[1:43:26] other words, this in the same way the
[1:43:29] devil is what the world teaches us, the
[1:43:32] devil is angry, he's hateful, he's
[1:43:35] jealous, he's envious, he's a
[1:43:37] fornicator, he's adulterous, he's a
[1:43:40] murderer, he's a liar, he's a this, he's
[1:43:42] a that. all those attributes. But you
[1:43:45] get the thief on the cross who did all
[1:43:48] those things and yet he was with Christ
[1:43:50] in paradise. You get people who have
[1:43:53] done a whole lot of these things. That
[1:43:55] doesn't make them the devil or possessed
[1:43:57] of the devil. They're doing bad things,
[1:43:59] but in their heart they are submitting
[1:44:02] to truth,
[1:44:04] right? You can have a lot of people who
[1:44:06] are submitting to truth and yet still
[1:44:08] getting involved in some of these
[1:44:10] things. So the spirit of lies and the
[1:44:14] father of lies. If we see who is the
[1:44:17] devil and this here in the um your in
[1:44:21] the Greek diabolos
[1:44:23] in the Greek false accuser or slanderer
[1:44:29] diabolos that's where the word devil
[1:44:31] comes from. Diavalos it's actually I
[1:44:34] think in their languages though it says
[1:44:36] be there they pronounce it as v.
[1:44:38] Diavalos right? They have a certain way
[1:44:40] they pronounce B like W
[1:44:44] diabolos, right? That's how you get
[1:44:46] devil. Devil.
[1:44:49] And what is the meaning of Diablo?
[1:44:53] False accuser, slanderer, young man.
[1:44:59] H Lamborghini Diablo.
[1:45:05] That car is a liar.
[1:45:07] False accuser.
[1:45:10] H
[1:45:13] Chad, you don't believe me?
[1:45:16] Yeah, it's going to kill you one day.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. False accuser. That's what devil
[1:45:24] actually means. It's a liar, right? John
[1:45:26] 8:43-44.
[1:45:28] Why do you understand not understand my
[1:45:30] speech even because you cannot hear my
[1:45:32] word? And then he's speaking to the
[1:45:35] Pharisees. You are of your father the
[1:45:37] devil. And then he identifies it. The
[1:45:40] lust of your father you will do. Lust
[1:45:42] will mean the desires.
[1:45:45] He was a murderer from the beginning and
[1:45:47] he abode. I love this. I love this. He
[1:45:50] abode not in the truth because there is
[1:45:53] no truth in him.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of
[1:45:58] his own. In other words, he can't help
[1:45:59] it because it's his nature.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; For he is a liar. And the father of it
[1:46:04] means he's the source of it. Got it? So
[1:46:08] lies
[1:46:10] as was defined as the work of the devil.
[1:46:13] So you'll find this throughout the
[1:46:14] scripture. They call them the sons of
[1:46:16] Biel,
[1:46:17] right? False accusers or false witness.
[1:46:20] Like when Nabbath uh was killed, they
[1:46:23] brought two sons of Biel to lie about
[1:46:25] him so that Ahab could kill him and take
[1:46:28] the vineyard. They did the same thing
[1:46:29] with Christ, sons of Biel. In the Bible,
[1:46:32] they call that liars, right? So you can
[1:46:36] see this in the Bible when the word
[1:46:38] devil is used it means lying spirit.
[1:46:43] Sunday school what is a devil? A lying
[1:46:46] spirit. That's a devil. Not those other
[1:46:50] pictures.
[1:46:51] A lie. So if you are believing a lie,
[1:46:55] you are believing a devil.
[1:46:59] And why is it dangerous? Because when
[1:47:01] you believe a lie, it's going to make
[1:47:03] you act on it.
[1:47:05] And when you act on it, there are going
[1:47:08] to be consequences. There are going to
[1:47:10] be bad.
[1:47:13] Let's read a scripture. John 7 19 to 20.
[1:47:17] Did not Moses give you the law? This is
[1:47:20] Christ speaking and saying, "Yet none of
[1:47:22] you keepeth the law. Why go you about to
[1:47:25] kill me?" He already discerned their
[1:47:27] heart and knew they want to kill him.
[1:47:29] Listen what they say. The people
[1:47:30] answered and said, "Thou hast a devil.
[1:47:33] Who goest about to kill thee? What do
[1:47:36] they actually say? Stop lying. We're not
[1:47:40] going about to kill you.
[1:47:43] That's what they meant by saying, "Thou
[1:47:44] has the devil." It means you have a
[1:47:46] lying spirit. They're not telling him
[1:47:48] you have Satan. They're telling him you
[1:47:51] are lying. You are telling a lie. We
[1:47:53] don't want We don't want to kill you.
[1:47:54] Right? So, is the devil only Lucifer?
[1:47:58] No.
[1:48:00] But is Lucifer a devil? Yes. because
[1:48:02] Lucifer is a liar. Got it? So, he was
[1:48:07] the beginning of lies, the beginning of
[1:48:09] devils. Now, anything So, here it is,
[1:48:12] and we're going to get to this the next
[1:48:13] time we come and speak about the
[1:48:15] subject. Anything that tells lies,
[1:48:19] spreads lies, projects lie.
[1:48:25] Because when we lie, it pollutes our
[1:48:28] little spirit.
[1:48:32] It makes our spirit. And when you tell
[1:48:33] the first lie, you have to tell a second
[1:48:36] lie to cover up that lie. And then
[1:48:38] another lie to cover up that lie. And
[1:48:40] then it starts polluting your nature.
[1:48:42] And then you start getting that nature
[1:48:45] inside your soul. And from there on,
[1:48:47] you're only going to tell lies. Nobody's
[1:48:49] going to trust you again. Bad things are
[1:48:53] going to happen. People won't love you
[1:48:55] the way you should be loved because
[1:48:57] inside you are telling lies.
[1:49:00] But everyone that is honest and tells
[1:49:02] the truth and has integrity is someone
[1:49:05] everyone will trust and will have
[1:49:08] compassion on and will love that person.
[1:49:12] Are you with me? Anything. So I want you
[1:49:16] to go and look this week. All right?
[1:49:19] Everywhere in the world, everywhere you
[1:49:21] go this week, I want you to you young
[1:49:23] people look at the advertisements that
[1:49:26] you read. you older people, go look at
[1:49:28] the the medicine bottles that you that
[1:49:31] you look at on the shelves. Go look at
[1:49:33] the adverts they're showing you on
[1:49:35] YouTube. Go look at the stuff they put
[1:49:37] in the newspaper. Identify how many lies
[1:49:40] you read in one day.
[1:49:44] And then you're going to know why the
[1:49:45] world acts the way it is,
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; right? Why we are getting sicker.
[1:49:52] Anything that tells lies, spread lies,
[1:49:55] projects lies is demonology.
[1:49:58] It's being manifested because there is a
[1:50:00] nature of deceit being imprinted into
[1:50:03] mankind and it comes from the beginner
[1:50:06] of lies. Knowing this or if you know
[1:50:10] this, if you know what is truth and you
[1:50:12] know what is lies, it makes it easier
[1:50:15] young people to identify the devil in
[1:50:18] your daily life.
[1:50:21] you'll be able to know. So, you should
[1:50:24] be able to know when you're sitting in
[1:50:26] university or in school and they're
[1:50:28] telling you something and is against the
[1:50:30] word of God. You have the right to write
[1:50:33] their answer in their exam, but you got
[1:50:36] to know your spirit cannot believe that
[1:50:39] because it's against truth.
[1:50:44] All right. In conclusion,
[1:50:48] who is God and who is the devil? Both
[1:50:51] are two spirits, two natures which are
[1:50:54] the major influence in our world today.
[1:50:56] We'll close with this quote. Now
[1:50:59] remember this Christ in the true church
[1:51:00] is a continuation of the book of acts.
[1:51:03] But the book of revelation shows us how
[1:51:05] that the antichrist spirit would come,
[1:51:07] antichrist spirit would come into the
[1:51:09] church and defile it. How does the
[1:51:13] antichrist defile the church?
[1:51:17] Making it lukewarm. So there's the
[1:51:19] consequences of what the antichrist
[1:51:22] would do. It would turn the church
[1:51:23] lukewarm,
[1:51:25] formal, and powerless.
[1:51:28] It exposes Satan, revealing his works,
[1:51:31] attempted destruction of God's people,
[1:51:33] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:51:36] down to the time he is cast into the
[1:51:38] lake of fire. Now, HERE IT IS.
[1:51:41] HE FIGHTS THAT. WHO? The devil. He
[1:51:44] cannot stand that. He knows that if
[1:51:47] people get the true revelation of the
[1:51:50] true church and what she is and what she
[1:51:54] stands for and that she can do the
[1:51:57] greater works, she will be an invincible
[1:52:00] army. If they get a true revelation of
[1:52:04] the two spirits within the framework of
[1:52:07] the Christian church and by God's spirit
[1:52:10] discern and withstand the antichrist
[1:52:13] spirit, Satan will be powerless before
[1:52:17] her.
[1:52:19] That means simply put if everything
[1:52:23] if the lies can be taken out
[1:52:26] there is no more adversary
[1:52:29] to God's true purpose for the church.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; Satan is the adversary.
[1:52:35] Right? So here's something as we close
[1:52:39] this down. There is actually a thing
[1:52:43] called the true church and the false
[1:52:46] church.
[1:52:49] AND THEY WERE INTERTWINED.
[1:52:51] WHAT is true church means that had
[1:52:54] truth. False church was operating by
[1:52:56] lies.
[1:52:58] BUT IT'S A CHURCH which means it's
[1:53:00] worshiping God.
[1:53:03] But it's a church. IT'S WORSHIPING GOD.
[1:53:07] IT'S FOLLOWING LIES, WHICH MEANS IT'S
[1:53:09] ACTUALLY SUBMITTING to the devil
[1:53:13] in the name of Jesus.
[1:53:18] Right? And who is the devil? He's a
[1:53:20] pretender and he leads by the spirit of
[1:53:23] lies. The true church is led by the
[1:53:25] spirit of truth. So Sunday school, who
[1:53:28] is God? The spirit of
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; truth. Who is the devil? The spirit of
[1:53:34] lies.
[1:53:36] That's why. See, I'll tell you in my
[1:53:40] house, my kids can do wrong things. They
[1:53:45] can mess up. They can
[1:53:49] beat each other up. They can fight. They
[1:53:52] can get angry. But the one thing we
[1:53:54] stand on is do not lie to mommy and
[1:53:57] daddy.
[1:53:59] If you tell the truth, there's special
[1:54:01] things coming for you. Tell the truth.
[1:54:04] Even if it gets you in trouble, take the
[1:54:06] punishment, but always tell the truth.
[1:54:09] Because why? Mommy and daddy want to
[1:54:11] trust you.
[1:54:13] And someday when you're a teenager, we
[1:54:15] want to be able to trust you and say,
[1:54:17] "There you go. You can take the car. You
[1:54:18] can drive somewhere. You can go there
[1:54:20] with your friend. We can trust you
[1:54:21] because we know you tell the truth." But
[1:54:24] if you're always lying, always covering
[1:54:27] up, we can never fully trust you
[1:54:31] because everybody knows you're not
[1:54:33] telling the truth.
[1:54:35] So always tell the truth. Are you with
[1:54:37] us?
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. So this is the real secret to all
[1:54:43] demonology in the world. Everything in
[1:54:47] this world operates by two things. Truth
[1:54:51] and openness or lies and deceit.
[1:54:56] Okay.
[1:54:59] Well, let's just end it there, right?
[1:55:02] This is the real secret to all
[1:55:04] demonology
[1:55:06] which we have covered in the series we
[1:55:08] did on demonology.
[1:55:10] What is it? Demonology starts with a
[1:55:14] lie.
[1:55:17] Then demonology takes its stand with
[1:55:19] lies. Which means after it starts with a
[1:55:22] lie, it builds a foundation of lies and
[1:55:26] then builds on the lie. And then the
[1:55:30] stronger the lie, the stronger the
[1:55:33] demonology.
[1:55:35] Right? The religion of Christianity
[1:55:38] today that created this idea of casting
[1:55:42] out devils from people without truth
[1:55:47] has become part of the demonology
[1:55:50] itself.
[1:55:52] Don't miss that. What I'm saying to you
[1:55:55] is today you've got Christians who want
[1:55:58] to run off and cast out devils from
[1:56:01] people. How? By Jesus name. Jesus name.
[1:56:05] Praying hands. Jesus name. You cannot
[1:56:09] cast out a lie without truth.
[1:56:13] YOU CAN SHOUT THE NAME OF Jesus as much
[1:56:15] as you want to. You can sing songs. So
[1:56:18] I'm going to without going into what I'm
[1:56:21] going to speak to in the next few
[1:56:23] services.
[1:56:25] You can go to a person. Let's say you
[1:56:27] have the misfortune of meeting a
[1:56:29] demon-possessed person. The idea that
[1:56:33] Christians have today is you need to
[1:56:35] call a team of people to cast out the
[1:56:38] devil. And how do they do it? By
[1:56:40] shouting the name of Jesus or holy water
[1:56:44] or crossing themselves. That itself is
[1:56:47] demonology.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm telling you.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; that in itself is using a making a
[1:56:56] greater lie. I can't tell you how many
[1:56:58] times I've seen those people sneering at
[1:57:00] them.
[1:57:02] Literally had in the Bible. Jesus, I
[1:57:04] know. Peter, I know. WHO ARE YOU?
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; WHO are you?
[1:57:08] Right? The the very devil even asks
[1:57:11] that. So, here's the thing.
[1:57:14] Most of the people I have seen in my
[1:57:16] life which has been good few years from
[1:57:20] the time I'm a child demon-possessed
[1:57:23] people are afflicted people. They are
[1:57:26] depressed people. They have anxiety.
[1:57:29] They have fears. They have doubt. And
[1:57:32] how do they get to be this way?
[1:57:35] Something happened.
[1:57:37] Something happened to them. Something
[1:57:40] bad happened to them. They could have
[1:57:42] been abused. They could have witnessed
[1:57:44] the murder of a parent. They could have
[1:57:46] witnessed something that damaged them.
[1:57:48] There there's something in them that
[1:57:50] placed a lie
[1:57:53] inside that then manifested into a
[1:57:56] depression
[1:57:58] and anxiety and fear and doubt. So you
[1:58:01] can go there and shout Jesus.
[1:58:04] You can shout. You can sing songs. You
[1:58:06] can fast and pray. Unless you get to the
[1:58:09] foundation of the lie, it's only going
[1:58:12] to come back seven times stronger.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; That's the word.
[1:58:21] Which means that person you can have
[1:58:24] like a young person today. You messed up
[1:58:26] in your life. I don't know, you
[1:58:28] fornicated. You did something bad and
[1:58:31] you don't you don't want to confess it.
[1:58:33] You can't get it out. You're living with
[1:58:34] it. You're covering it up. That's
[1:58:37] stress, man.
[1:58:39] That's going to produce stress on you
[1:58:40] that you can't believe. You're hiding it
[1:58:43] away. You're you're And then you have to
[1:58:45] live your life like a pretense.
[1:58:49] That's stress. AND THAT'S WHAT produces
[1:58:52] anxiety and demonology. And then WHEN IF
[1:58:55] SOMEONE HAS TO ASK YOU ABOUT something
[1:58:57] or something is uncovered or something
[1:58:59] comes to light, then you have to create
[1:59:00] a bigger lie to cover that up. AND THAT
[1:59:03] WHAT THAT'S DOING is causing demonology
[1:59:05] to build on the previous lie.
[1:59:08] Eventually, the way it's going to come
[1:59:10] out is a whole lot of truth has to be
[1:59:12] explained and then you're going to
[1:59:15] answer for so much
[1:59:18] and only God can do that. Now, I'm not
[1:59:21] saying that you can't come under the
[1:59:24] anointing and they come and pray for you
[1:59:26] in the name of Jesus. And by faith, you
[1:59:29] take hold of their faith and you get
[1:59:31] released from the the the hold of the
[1:59:34] lie. All you've done is you've released
[1:59:36] them from the hold of the lie, but the
[1:59:39] lie still exists.
[1:59:43] That's your devil.
[1:59:45] That's what's going to lead. If you even
[1:59:47] live with that lie for even longer, you
[1:59:50] are it's going to cause you to even
[1:59:52] accept a wrong doctrine
[1:59:56] because the wrong doctrine is a perfect
[1:59:58] cover for that lie.
[2:00:01] This is how deep demonology goes. It
[2:00:04] always starts with a lie. It's not
[2:00:07] somebody put a spell on me. It's not
[2:00:09] witch doctors. It's not summas. It's not
[2:00:12] all those other. It's not something else
[2:00:14] that somebody preached a wrong doctrine.
[2:00:17] If somebody preached a wrong doctrine,
[2:00:19] why did you believe it?
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; Because there was already a lie sitting
[2:00:25] in there that gave you the proclivity
[2:00:28] to believe a wrong doctrine to get into
[2:00:32] something. But if there is truth, if
[2:00:34] there is light, you are going to discern
[2:00:36] good and evil. If you have received uh
[2:00:39] the Holy SPIRIT IN THERE THAT UPS THAT'S
[2:00:41] WHAT YOUNG PEOPLE need to have. That's
[2:00:43] what people who come to GOD NEED TO
[2:00:45] HAVE. THAT'S WHAT REPENTANCE is about.
[2:00:47] REPENTANCE IS ABOUT FREEING YOURSELF of
[2:00:50] all the lies.
[2:00:53] Glory to God. If you know it is relief
[2:00:58] to live in the light. That's why I
[2:00:59] always tell people walk in the light.
[2:01:02] Like the word says let your yay be yay
[2:01:04] and your nay be nay. You never have to
[2:01:06] make promises or prove yourself to
[2:01:08] people if you just tell the truth. If
[2:01:11] you live in the light, walk in the
[2:01:13] truth.
[2:01:15] Amen. Now, here's something as we close
[2:01:18] this down. In John 8:44, he says, "The
[2:01:21] the devil abode not in the truth,
[2:01:25] neither is the truth in him."
[2:01:28] That's a profound statement because I
[2:01:30] want to ask it this way. There's so many
[2:01:32] important understandings and truths that
[2:01:34] we can get from there.
[2:01:37] My question to you in closing, can you
[2:01:39] abide in the truth?
[2:01:42] And can truth abide in you?
[2:01:46] That's what we need to go back and think
[2:01:48] on, right? Because in John 14:20, he
[2:01:50] says, "In that day, you shall know that
[2:01:53] I am in the father, the father is in me,
[2:01:55] and oh, I in you and you in me."
[2:01:58] Can you abide in the truth? Then can the
[2:02:00] truth abide in you? Can you hold the
[2:02:04] truth?
[2:02:07] Amen. We have to in this day sons of God
[2:02:10] seek for the truth. He also said that we
[2:02:13] must abide in his word and his word must
[2:02:16] abide in us and that the word itself is
[2:02:19] truth. Saints, this is our only God
[2:02:22] against demonology today. There's no
[2:02:25] crosses, no prayers, no chants, no
[2:02:29] special words, no special prayers, no
[2:02:33] St. Christopher or Martin or whoever, no
[2:02:36] Mary, no anything. There's no uh uh what
[2:02:39] do they call those things? Medallions
[2:02:41] and and and um talismen, nothing. If you
[2:02:46] are listening to those things, if you
[2:02:47] are keeping those things, they are lies.
[2:02:51] All you need is a spirit of truth. The
[2:02:54] spirit of truth dispels. The same way
[2:02:56] when you switch on the light, all
[2:02:58] darkness disappears.
[2:03:00] That's what truth does.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; It separates the dimensions.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Let's bow our heads. Amen.
[2:03:07] As we pray.
