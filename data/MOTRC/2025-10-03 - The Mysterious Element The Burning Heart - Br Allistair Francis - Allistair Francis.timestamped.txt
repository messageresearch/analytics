[0:00] Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads
[0:01] together.
[0:04] Dear heavenly father, we humbly bow in
[0:07] your presence this morning. We're so
[0:10] thankful, Lord, for your presence with
[0:12] us, your grace, your mercy, the love,
[0:16] the strength, the joy that we feel in
[0:19] our hearts.
[0:20] Truly Lord, your word has been the
[0:22] inspiration of our lives, the
[0:25] inspiration of our path before us.
[0:29] There is none like you, Lord.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like your word. There's
[0:34] nothing so beautiful. There's nothing
[0:36] that we treasure more than this great
[0:40] word that you have revealed in these
[0:42] last days.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for your people,
[0:47] the manifestation of your divine nature
[0:51] made flesh
[0:53] in these last days. the light that has
[0:56] struck the earth.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; Father, we are so thankful, Lord, for
[1:01] this glorious message
[1:03] &gt;&gt; that you brought to us and purposed that
[1:06] it be abiding in our hearts,
[1:09] &gt;&gt; manifesting
[1:11] through our souls,
[1:14] through our flesh, through our words,
[1:17] through our actions, through our lives.
[1:20] Lord, making us better people.
[1:24] Not just better people but chosen
[1:26] people.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27] &gt;&gt; With the works that were for ordained
[1:30] before the foundation of the world.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Lord we appreciate you this morning and
[1:35] we ask you to bless the service to us.
[1:38] Bless the reading of the word, the
[1:39] preaching of it and all of us here
[1:42] gathered together. It's just a human
[1:44] gathering as some would say. But Lord
[1:48] two mysterious elements are meeting. And
[1:52] where that happens, there is
[1:54] omnipotence,
[1:55] there is love, there is joy, there is
[1:57] peace, there is celebration, there is
[2:00] rejoicing.
[2:01] And we are thankful to be a part of that
[2:03] meeting this morning. Bless us now,
[2:05] Lord, we pray. Ask it all in your
[2:07] precious name with much praise and
[2:10] thanksgiving. Amen.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; While you're standing, let's read in our
[2:15] Bibles.
[2:16] I'd like to take a reading from Luke
[2:18] chap 24 and verse 18-32.
[2:23] Very familiar portion of scripture.
[2:29] Those
[2:33] of you who know this
[2:36] as from the message that brother Vam
[2:38] preached and when their eyes were opened
[2:43] Luke 24:18-32
[2:46] and if you're there the word of God
[2:47] reads like this and the one of them
[2:49] whose name was Cleopus answering said
[2:52] unto him art thou only a stranger in
[2:56] Jerusalem and has not known the things
[2:58] which are come to pass there in these
[3:01] days? And he said unto them, "What
[3:04] things?"
[3:06] And they said unto him, "Concerning
[3:08] Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet
[3:11] mighty indeed, and word before God and
[3:13] all the people, and how the chief
[3:16] priests and our rulers delivered him to
[3:18] be condemned to death, and they have
[3:21] crucified him." But we trusted that it
[3:24] had been he which should have redeemed
[3:26] Israel. And beside all this, today is
[3:29] the third day since these things were
[3:32] done.
[3:33] Yay. And certain women also of our
[3:35] company made us astonished, which were
[3:37] early at the sephila. And when they had
[3:40] found not his body, they came, saying
[3:44] that they also had seen a vision of
[3:46] angels, which said he was alive. And
[3:50] certain of them which were with us went
[3:52] to the sephila and found it even as so
[3:56] as the woman had said, but him they saw
[3:59] not.
[4:01] Then he said unto them, "Oh fools, slow
[4:04] of heart."
[4:06] Watch that. Slow of heart.
[4:11] How that How's that going to change?
[4:13] Heart needs to be quickened.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. slow of heart to believe all that
[4:19] the prophets have spoken.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Ought not Christ to have suffered these
[4:24] things? It's as if it's telling them
[4:25] something they should have known,
[4:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[4:29] &gt;&gt; Ought not Christ to have suffered these
[4:31] things and to enter into his glory?
[4:35] And beginning at Moses and all the
[4:39] prophets, he expounded unto them in all
[4:41] the scriptures the things concerning
[4:44] himself.
[4:46] And they drew nigh unto the village
[4:48] wheither they went. And he made as
[4:50] though he would have gone further. But
[4:52] they constrained him, saying, "Abide
[4:55] with us." For it is toward evening, and
[4:57] the days far spent, and he went into
[5:00] tarry with them. And it came to pass as
[5:03] he sat at meat with them, he took bread,
[5:05] and blessed it, and break it, and gave
[5:07] to them, and their eyes were open, and
[5:09] they knew him, and he vanished out of
[5:12] their sight.
[5:13] And they said one to another, "Did not
[5:16] our heart burn within us while he talked
[5:20] with us by the way and while he opened
[5:23] to us the scriptures?"
[5:26] Watch that. Did not our heart burn
[5:29] within us
[5:31] while he talked with us? What are they
[5:33] talking about? The walk.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; Their heart was burning on the walk.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; And why was their heart burning? because
[5:41] he was opening the scriptures to them.
[5:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; And that's what the open book means to
[5:48] us.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:50] &gt;&gt; The Lord add a blessing to his word. You
[5:51] may be seated.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm extremely grateful, honored,
[5:57] and privileged to be here speaking the
[5:59] word of the Lord with you this morning.
[6:02] And I'd like to just greet every one of
[6:04] you. Bring greetings from South Africa.
[6:07] Uh and uh just from all the saints
[6:10] there. We're just like you. We're flesh
[6:12] and blood.
[6:14] &gt;&gt; We're receiving the word of God. We're
[6:16] growing day by day. We're closing on to
[6:19] perfection.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh we trust that that is your
[6:23] experience. We know that is your
[6:24] experience here, too. So, I just want to
[6:26] thank um dear brother Chad for the
[6:28] invitation and confidence that we could
[6:32] be here and share the word of God with
[6:34] you. And I'm certainly happy also to be
[6:38] like I said sharing the battlefield with
[6:39] my dear brother. It's uh not always you
[6:42] get um part of the commonwealth here
[6:45] together
[6:47] you know Australia and South Africa. Uh
[6:50] so but we're appreciating the the divine
[6:54] word of the lord the his planning. It's
[6:57] all him and we appreciate that. just
[6:59] listening to him uh and the two of us in
[7:01] the last few days, it was the struggles
[7:04] we had to go through to get here.
[7:06] &gt;&gt; I was asking, Lord, are we really
[7:08] supposed to be there
[7:10] &gt;&gt; and what's going on? And so, but I'm
[7:13] just so thankful to see how it all
[7:14] worked out and we appreciate also. Thank
[7:17] you to brother Ray. He's always been
[7:19] wonderful to me in the years that I'
[7:21] I've known him and to my dad, brother
[7:23] Steve. So we appreciate you my brother
[7:26] and all the visiting people here. May
[7:28] the Lord bless you. Also want also like
[7:32] I I thank those at the True Word
[7:34] Tabernacle. Just thank you for your
[7:37] prayers for us in the passing of our
[7:39] brother Steve and we appreciate that.
[7:42] Gave us a lot of strength,
[7:43] encouragement. So uh we just appreciate
[7:46] you. Amen.
[7:48] So I want to um get into the word this
[7:52] morning. I don't like to waste too much
[7:54] of time because I like to spend most of
[7:56] the time on that. But um I you know
[8:01] coming together to meetings like this
[8:03] and when you have more than one minister
[8:06] I've never I've never been used to that.
[8:08] Usually just go to a place where I'm
[8:10] invited and I speak by myself. But
[8:12] speaking with another minister can be
[8:14] challenging. But I was so encouraged
[8:16] last night. I can't wait for this
[8:18] evening to hear the summation of it. So,
[8:22] but the way things happened is it kind
[8:25] of uh adjusted what I was going to
[8:27] speak. Of course, I had a copyright
[8:29] which uh but so it kind of adjusted it
[8:33] and like a bit of a title here and
[8:36] there. And so I I wanted to take this
[8:39] and break it up over two services, but
[8:41] now we're going to put it all into one
[8:44] &gt;&gt; by God's grace. And perhaps tomorrow do
[8:47] something more. wait for tonight and see
[8:49] what happens and then move in tomorrow.
[8:51] Perhaps there's another copyright
[8:53] happening.
[8:54] But so I want to take from that from the
[8:56] leading of the Holy Spirit. I believe it
[8:58] was and uh uh we'll have a title and a
[9:01] subtitle. And so the title will be the
[9:05] mysterious element.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about the mysterious
[9:09] element and the subtitle the burning
[9:12] heart.
[9:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's simple. The answer lies
[9:17] within you.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Christ didn't do anything else but go
[9:20] back to the scriptures and reveal to
[9:23] them what they had already known what
[9:26] was in their heart.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; There's nothing new we can give you.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; But he went back to the word and started
[9:32] revealing what was inside. Amen.
[9:35] &gt;&gt; So just as an introduction
[9:39] uh I think a lot of people
[9:42] don't appreciate this.
[9:45] you and and we were talking o over the
[9:48] the last few days. Do you realize you
[9:52] are living in the day of the unfolding
[9:56] of the seventh seal?
[10:00] &gt;&gt; Right now, don't just agree with that.
[10:02] You've got to see the reality of it.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; In Paul's day, he was living in the
[10:08] unfolding of the first seal.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; What What happened? The what? What does
[10:14] the unfolding do? It produces a whole
[10:16] lot of events, right?
[10:18] &gt;&gt; So, here was the the messenger coming
[10:20] out, Paul. And what was the unfolding of
[10:23] the first seal? A white horse rider.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; That's the symbol. How did it manifest
[10:30] in people?
[10:32] &gt;&gt; How did it do that? A a church began to
[10:35] rise up. A false church. A church that
[10:38] was copying the original,
[10:41] &gt;&gt; right? And it was a religious spirit.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; It had it was white
[10:48] &gt;&gt; which is religion.
[10:49] &gt;&gt; It looked like it had power. It had a
[10:52] bow. It was given a crown. It
[10:54] &gt;&gt; means people gave it recognition.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; This was where was this happening? Where
[10:59] was this White House writer? In people
[11:02] &gt;&gt; and every seal that unfolded and the
[11:04] manifestation was manifested in people.
[11:08] People are thinking the seventh seal is
[11:10] all about Christ coming in the air and
[11:13] him appearing. That's never been the
[11:16] case with the with the seals.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; The seals has to be the mystery
[11:21] unfolding in people.
[11:24] &gt;&gt; It's always in people.
[11:26] &gt;&gt; Even when you look at the theory and you
[11:27] and you talk about it, it unfolds in
[11:31] people. You've you're going to see it.
[11:33] The world will react. The world is
[11:35] reacting according to the unfolding of
[11:37] the seventh seal.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; The bride is reacting according to the
[11:40] unfolding of the seventh seal. It's all
[11:43] been there in the prophecy.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; So here are the important things and I
[11:50] don't want to labor that because I know
[11:51] your pastor has already done that. But
[11:54] the the fundamental things about the
[11:56] seventh seal is that the seventh seal
[12:00] brings him back to earth. Yes.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; Now look how simple that is, right? The
[12:05] seventh seal brings him back to earth.
[12:07] Now unpack that
[12:09] &gt;&gt; because it's so easy to go to the
[12:11] Pentecostal understanding of Christ
[12:13] coming back to earth,
[12:15] &gt;&gt; right?
[12:16] &gt;&gt; And listen, don't take us for granted.
[12:19] That's part of the seventh seal mystery.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; The greatest of all the seals. Amen.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; Now, if every other seal had a mystery
[12:26] to it that was hard for the people to
[12:28] see.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; If the seventh seal is the greatest of
[12:31] all the seals, don't think the coming of
[12:33] the Lord is just going to be something
[12:34] that someone's just going to simplify.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; No, it's not going to be that way. Of
[12:40] course, it's going to be simple because
[12:41] you're the elected to you,
[12:44] &gt;&gt; but to everyone else, it's hidden.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; It's a seal.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:50] So the seventh seal bringing him back to
[12:53] earth is not going to be something
[12:56] everybody sees or everybody expects or
[13:00] everybody understands or has a
[13:03] revelation of.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; How do we know? Well, how many believed
[13:07] the first coming?
[13:09] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of the gravity of
[13:11] that.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; All right. Everybody seems like
[13:14] preachers all over the world think that
[13:16] they just talk about the coming of the
[13:17] Lord and everyone gets it.
[13:20] Nobody got it in the first coming.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of the gravity of
[13:25] this. The very Messiah, God himself made
[13:31] flesh, had only 11 followers.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; I mean, if he couldn't convince all of
[13:40] Israel, how can we convince the whole
[13:43] world of the coming of the Lord?
[13:46] So don't be surprised by the resistance
[13:48] you get,
[13:50] &gt;&gt; right? Cuz no matter how you try to
[13:52] explain, they are going to reject you.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; And those closest to you
[13:59] &gt;&gt; because in the very end, the majority of
[14:01] the message in his day turned away.
[14:06] &gt;&gt; The moment the third pull was preached,
[14:09] &gt;&gt; eat my flesh, drink my blood, they said,
[14:12] what is this?
[14:14] &gt;&gt; What's that? That that was word that
[14:15] required revelation.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; And look at the elect. He turns around.
[14:21] He said, "Will you leave me also?"
[14:24] &gt;&gt; What was the elect's words? Where shall
[14:26] we go?
[14:28] &gt;&gt; You have the words.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; Of eternal life.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; The true elect were seeking word.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; But the type itself shows you how few
[14:41] &gt;&gt; there will be. Now it gets even I would
[14:45] say worse than that but better for us
[14:50] in this message desperations.
[14:52] He says how is it this paragraph 53 how
[14:55] is it that we can see other great signs
[14:57] and wonders done on others. And what
[15:00] about us? It should cause an a state of
[15:02] desperation that we are determined
[15:04] before God. Now I want you to see
[15:06] something. The prophet never says things
[15:09] outright. I have always young people
[15:11] asking me. Yeah, but you're explaining.
[15:13] You're explaining. Why doesn't he just
[15:14] say things outright? Why didn't Christ
[15:16] say things outright?
[15:18] &gt;&gt; Why didn't he just come out and say, "I
[15:20] am the son of God, the word, the logos
[15:22] made manifest in this day. I am the
[15:24] Messiah." Why didn't John the Baptist
[15:27] come out and say, "I am the forerunner
[15:28] of the first coming." They come and ask
[15:30] him, "Who is he? I'm the voice of one
[15:32] crying in the wilderness." Then they ask
[15:33] him, "Are you are that are you that
[15:35] prophet?" No.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; It even looks like he lied.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; Right? You read that?
[15:41] &gt;&gt; Well, who are you? Are you the Messiah?
[15:43] Are you that prophet? No.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; They keep referring to scripture.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; They keep going back to the word. Back
[15:50] to the scripture and they expect you to
[15:52] catch it.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; So, even in the word, you'll find in
[15:56] unveiling of God, I think it is round
[15:58] about page six where the or just in the
[16:01] beginning, the prophet said, I hope
[16:03] you're catching
[16:04] &gt;&gt; what we've been trying to say without
[16:08] saying it outright. Amen.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; And God permits it for us to say it that
[16:12] way
[16:13] &gt;&gt; to thin it down.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; To shift some out.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we read these quotes, and
[16:21] plenty of quotes, you know it all. I
[16:24] want you to see he's not going to say
[16:26] when when he's talking about the cloud,
[16:28] he's not going to say, "Did you know the
[16:30] cloud on sunset mountain February 28th?
[16:32] This and this and this. That's what
[16:34] we're talking about. That's what it is."
[16:36] Or such and such a time. That's what it
[16:37] is. when he speaks about the the vision
[16:40] in uh um ass is this the time he refers
[16:44] to it as he told us then and here it
[16:46] happened now you you remember all that
[16:49] &gt;&gt; so watch this he says the signs of his
[16:52] coming
[16:55] the signs of his coming
[16:57] &gt;&gt; should bring his entire congregation
[16:59] when we've read it from the word so when
[17:02] you read signs of his coming what sign
[17:05] what sign right now he starts to tell
[17:08] you without saying it outright says the
[17:11] Holy Spirit has told us go at certain
[17:13] place such and such a thing would
[17:15] happen. What's he talking about? Let's
[17:16] just say where did the Holy Spirit tell
[17:18] him? So is this the time? Go out west,
[17:21] go to uh uh Arizona. Such and such a
[17:24] time this will happen. Not tell us what
[17:26] it was, but it would happen. We go there
[17:29] and it happens that way. Now you get the
[17:32] clue. The newspaper packs it. The
[17:35] magazines packed it. Show the picture of
[17:38] it,
[17:39] &gt;&gt; right? Come back. What's he said? It's a
[17:41] sign of his coming.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; Come back here and see those great
[17:47] mysteries. What's that? The week where
[17:49] you preach the seven seals,
[17:50] &gt;&gt; right? Come back here. See the great
[17:53] mysteries hidden in the Bible open up to
[17:55] us on a new field that we never knew
[18:00] before and blends perfectly blends into
[18:03] the coming of the Lord
[18:05] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus. A new field we've
[18:08] never known before.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; It perfectly blends into the coming of
[18:11] the Lord. Can you see the coming of the
[18:13] Lord is not just going to be what the
[18:15] Pentecostals know, what everyone else
[18:17] knows. It's a new field.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; We've never known before.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; If it's a new field, we shouldn't be
[18:24] preaching something that everybody else
[18:26] knows.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Then paragraph 54, at the end of the
[18:32] messages, see the action of the great
[18:34] Holy Spirit. See him come down visible
[18:36] before the people. Even take pictures of
[18:39] it. See it working, showing that it's
[18:41] not a man.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; What's it revealing? It's not a man.
[18:47] Amen.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; What's he saying? It wasn't me.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Catch it, church.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; It wasn't me.
[18:56] &gt;&gt; It's not a man.
[18:57] &gt;&gt; It was me, but it wasn't me.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Even take picture. See it working,
[19:03] showing it's not a man. It's not just a
[19:05] preacher.
[19:06] &gt;&gt; You You understand, right? It's not a
[19:09] certain congregation. It's the Holy
[19:10] Spirit showing the same thing it did
[19:12] when it was embodied in the body of
[19:14] Jesus Christ. Now it's embodied in the
[19:16] body of his bride. There's the
[19:19] three-fold. It showed uh it should throw
[19:22] us into desperation.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[19:27] And this is where I want to uh get to
[19:30] now you know this God's great mystery of
[19:31] how it's a secret. He kept it a secret.
[19:33] Nobody know anything about it. What's he
[19:35] talking about Bible readers?
[19:37] &gt;&gt; The secret nobody knowed about
[19:40] &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; The second coming of the Lord, right? Uh
[19:45] and then he says even the angels didn't
[19:47] understand it. He didn't reveal it. Now
[19:50] I want you to see in this particular
[19:52] quote how he joins the coming of the
[19:55] Lord, the seventh seal and the thunders.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; This is the forerunner.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; He has the authority to do that.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; He if you had any uh confusion about it
[20:08] before, here it is. Right.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord, the seventh
[20:12] seal, and the thunders are all linked.
[20:15] &gt;&gt; There it is. Let's read.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; He's what the great secret no one knew
[20:19] about. The angels didn't understand. You
[20:21] said it's the coming of the Lord, right?
[20:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if you nodded your head,
[20:24] you're responsible.
[20:27] That's the reason under our seventh
[20:31] mystery, that's the seventh seal. When
[20:34] the seventh seal was opened, there was
[20:36] silence. Why was there silence? the
[20:38] coming of the Lord
[20:40] &gt;&gt; right Jesus when he was on earth they
[20:42] wanted to know when he would come are we
[20:45] talking about the coming of the lord
[20:46] right and it's not e even the son
[20:49] himself don't know it when it's going to
[20:51] happen see god has it all himself it's a
[20:53] secret and that's the reason now watch
[20:56] how he joins everything that's the
[20:58] reason
[21:00] uh there was silence in heaven for a
[21:02] space of half hour and seven thunders
[21:05] out of their voices and John was forbid
[21:08] bidden to write it. See
[21:11] &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:14] &gt;&gt; Now, that's one thing he hasn't revealed
[21:17] yet of how he will come and when he will
[21:19] come. If he hasn't revealed it yet, what
[21:23] is it? Well, that's part of the unknown
[21:25] language.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; That's part of the mysterious element.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:29] &gt;&gt; And we have to prove that in the
[21:31] scriptures.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; But then people say, see, he didn't
[21:34] reveal that the time and the hour. The
[21:36] secret is not the time and the hour.
[21:38] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you that. If God, what is
[21:40] it? It's it's Saturday. If God said came
[21:43] to you and said, "Right now, the coming
[21:45] of the Lord, the rapture is taking
[21:47] place, the translation is taking place
[21:48] on Tuesday at 9:00 in the morning."
[21:51] Right now, how many of you will be ready
[21:53] on Tuesday?
[21:55] &gt;&gt; If the secret was the time and the hour,
[21:58] how many of us will be ready?
[22:00] &gt;&gt; I'd be frantic. Yeah,
[22:02] &gt;&gt; I I don't even know whether the things I
[22:04] have to repent of will be enough. I'll
[22:07] have to think of things I've never
[22:08] repented of. I don't even know what I've
[22:10] done.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; How will you ever get it done by Tuesday
[22:13] 9:00?
[22:15] &gt;&gt; The secret is not the physical time or
[22:19] the hour.
[22:20] &gt;&gt; It cannot be.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; And yet the church world believes that.
[22:24] &gt;&gt; You know, 2012, who was that guy?
[22:27] Richard Camping I think it was Canada
[22:30] something like that said it was 21st I
[22:33] don't know April May then that failed
[22:36] then uh 21st September then that failed
[22:40] people have been doing this for how long
[22:43] &gt;&gt; date and hour and people gathered
[22:45] together and it's the rapture and we're
[22:47] going away it's not that and they're
[22:50] going to keep guessing at that
[22:52] &gt;&gt; you know you feel like they like this
[22:54] hype
[22:55] &gt;&gt; oh it's a secret we got Got to watch. If
[22:57] we're not watching, what happens when
[22:59] you're sleeping?
[23:01] We got to watch. Got to watch.
[23:03] Otherwise, we be caught unawares. We'll
[23:05] be taken away.
[23:07] Caught unawares means having no
[23:09] revelation.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; So then he he concludes it. It's a good
[23:14] thing that he doesn't know. And I love
[23:16] this paragraph of 107. So he hasn't
[23:19] revealed it. He hasn't told you
[23:20] everything, but he has showed or
[23:24] revealed it in every type that's in the
[23:27] Bible.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; You want the mysterious element?
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; Remember what he was saying last night?
[23:34] There's a mysterious element.
[23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's hidden in every type.
[23:40] &gt;&gt; So, church, that behooves us. If the
[23:45] mystery of the coming is in every type,
[23:49] &gt;&gt; we have to go search it out.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; And guaranteed when we find it, you're
[23:55] going to have a burning heart.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what we hope to achieve
[24:00] this morning, a burning heart
[24:03] experience.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So very quickly before I
[24:07] get to the actual message
[24:09] when we look at the seventh seal and I
[24:12] don't want to get into all of that but
[24:14] you know the prophet said I seen it
[24:16] unfolded in three-fold manner one
[24:18] unfolded yesterday one today one in an
[24:21] unknown language right so uh even when
[24:25] you look at that you can work out the
[24:27] theory of that and and like when when
[24:28] brother Chad was saying he was
[24:30] anticipating the seventh seal and uh
[24:32] reading through it and I did it read
[24:35] through the whole message and I got to
[24:36] the part and he's here and there
[24:39] explaining things. He's speaking things
[24:40] from the sixth seal. He's speaking
[24:42] things from the first seal. He's
[24:43] speaking things all over the place. And
[24:45] then he gets to this portion. He says,
[24:46] "Stop the tape."
[24:49] Right? And then he says, "I want to
[24:51] speak to you on the that fold." And he
[24:54] says, "Stop the tape." And then then
[24:56] you're thinking, "Well, now this is it."
[24:58] Right? And then he talks about the baby
[25:01] shoe and the rainbow trout and Junior
[25:04] Jackson's dream.
[25:06] But then he starts dropping hints.
[25:09] He says, "When this gets out, the people
[25:12] are going to think
[25:14] brother Vanam is making too much of
[25:16] himself.
[25:18] &gt;&gt; Watch that. When this when this gets
[25:20] out, they're going to think the wrong
[25:22] thing."
[25:23] &gt;&gt; Right? So when you look at how the
[25:26] seventh seal unfolds, what is it? If the
[25:28] seventh seal is the coming of the Lord
[25:30] or reveals the coming of the Lord when
[25:32] it's broken, if it brings him back to
[25:35] earth, what is Christ coming back to
[25:40] earth?
[25:42] Right? God descending,
[25:46] right? So what we see is three
[25:49] manifestations.
[25:51] God descending or condescending like
[25:53] brother Baron said which is probably
[25:56] grammatically or incorrect in in English
[26:00] God condescending cuz you know when we
[26:02] use the word condescend it's like we're
[26:04] looking down on someone
[26:05] &gt;&gt; you're being so condescending right but
[26:08] the prophet says condescending and it's
[26:10] true because he's he's coming into a
[26:13] lower state
[26:15] &gt;&gt; right
[26:16] &gt;&gt; so the first thing we see open up is a
[26:19] sign in the heavensmen Yes.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; And notice the prophet doesn't even know
[26:23] that he was there in Sunset Mountain.
[26:25] But you know something, he didn't even
[26:27] pick up the 28 minutes that it was about
[26:30] the space of half an hour
[26:32] &gt;&gt; the whole time. He didn't. It was the
[26:33] bride that did that.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; He kept talking about it in seven angels
[26:37] and then the the 63 starts talking about
[26:40] the seven angels. Did you see that? He
[26:42] only sees the picture of it in the
[26:44] magazine in May 17th or something and
[26:46] then starts talking about it. Said
[26:48] that's it. That's what happened when we
[26:49] were there. And um so thereafter 64 he's
[26:53] talking about the angel with the swept
[26:55] back wings and the notable one and all
[26:58] that. He comes back to by 65 he's
[27:00] annoyed
[27:02] because the brothers, you know, you know
[27:04] people in the message. Oh brother, look
[27:06] at it there. Can you see that in there?
[27:08] Can you see this? They must have been
[27:10] seeing a whole lot in there. and he
[27:12] started getting agitated
[27:14] and he's praying on it, looking at it.
[27:16] In 65, God says, "Turn the picture to
[27:19] the right."
[27:20] &gt;&gt; And when he turns the picture to the
[27:21] right, he says, "That's our Lord up
[27:23] there."
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; He didn't identify that in ' 63.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; He didn't identify it in ' 64. It only
[27:29] happened in ' 65 at the rising of the
[27:31] sun message.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is Easter with the Lord and I.
[27:36] Yeah.
[27:36] &gt;&gt; So notice that even that that
[27:39] manifestation that first part of the
[27:42] descent
[27:43] &gt;&gt; the shift from the seventh dimension to
[27:47] light matter time.
[27:50] &gt;&gt; The next step I want to ask you is a
[27:53] man. Now Revelations 5 says no man was
[27:58] worthy to take the book to even look
[28:02] thereon
[28:03] &gt;&gt; to open the seals. No man was worthy.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the pressure on that
[28:10] prophet when it was revealed to him? Do
[28:12] you know what you were doing yet in
[28:15] March 17 to March 24th?
[28:19] He said, "Did you see this mysterious
[28:21] week that it hasn't been a man,
[28:25] &gt;&gt; it's been them angels?"
[28:27] &gt;&gt; Said, "He came in every night and
[28:28] revealed himself to me." Right?
[28:31] So what we see then is a further
[28:33] descent.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; God becoming his prophet. I I think even
[28:39] in the seventh seal he prayed that the
[28:41] lamb stand here tonight to open the
[28:42] seat.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; God becoming the prophet.
[28:47] &gt;&gt; Now this is where everyone stumbles
[28:49] because if you can't see that wave
[28:51] sheath,
[28:52] &gt;&gt; you cannot be the crop.
[28:54] &gt;&gt; How can you see Christ becoming flesh in
[28:57] you if you couldn't see Christ becoming
[28:59] flesh in the prophet? Amen.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; To bring a purpose,
[29:03] &gt;&gt; right? And that's the descent.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Sign in the heaven, God in the prophet,
[29:09] God in the people.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; You can see him anointed ones at the end
[29:13] time, he gets struck. He said, "A son of
[29:16] man revealing the son of man."
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Christ the mystery then says, "God, the
[29:23] godhead bodily in the people." Amen.
[29:29] &gt;&gt; So you can see that's the descent.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; God moving from heaven to earth.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; That's the mystery.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Right
[29:38] &gt;&gt; now we can speak it. You can say amen.
[29:40] Now that we've told you, well, we're
[29:42] still here.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; You know, we know it,
[29:47] &gt;&gt; right? But it has to become flesh.
[29:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you, like we were
[29:52] saying over this these last few days, uh
[29:55] stop thinking that when you get it, it's
[29:57] time to go.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Stop waiting to go.
[30:03] The word has brought you to fulfill a
[30:05] purpose
[30:06] &gt;&gt; to become a better husband,
[30:08] &gt;&gt; a better wife,
[30:10] &gt;&gt; the right grandfather,
[30:12] &gt;&gt; the the best husband.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Remember, the best teenager,
[30:17] &gt;&gt; the best child, the best church member,
[30:20] the best pastor.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Stop running away from that and waiting
[30:24] for a translation to give you an escape.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; Let's finish our purpose.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; Let's run the race. The seven seal has
[30:31] come to make you run the race that you
[30:34] were chosen for.
[30:35] &gt;&gt; And it's not being a church member.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; I'm enjoying myself here.
[30:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not waiting to escape. I can't
[30:45] wait to see what more he can do through
[30:47] me.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; So, now that you see those three
[30:52] manifestations of the coming and how it
[30:55] unfolds, that's a simplicity. That's a
[30:56] skeleton. right now. Now, we must see
[31:00] because he said so. It's hidden in all
[31:03] the types and shadows. And that's what
[31:05] we want to do this morning.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; I spent about two years going through
[31:09] all the types and shadows from Genesis
[31:11] all the way through to Malachi because
[31:13] of that quote.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you it's all there.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; It's all there. those three
[31:21] manifestations,
[31:23] the three folds, the unknown language,
[31:26] God in the prophet, God in the people,
[31:29] &gt;&gt; the sign in the heaven. Now, sometimes
[31:31] you'll see exactly the three folds. It's
[31:34] so unmistakable, right? You know, the
[31:37] prophet said in Christ the mystery, he
[31:39] said, "Well, if you if you haven't seen
[31:41] if you read the Bible and you don't see
[31:43] Christ, go back and read it again."
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Right?
[31:46] &gt;&gt; Well, if you read the Bible and you
[31:48] don't see yourself in there, go back and
[31:49] read it again. Amen.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you read the Bible, you don't
[31:53] see the coming of Christ in every type
[31:55] and shadow, go back and read it again.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; If you read the Bible and you don't see
[31:58] the fulfillment of the seventh seal, go
[32:00] back and read it again.
[32:02] &gt;&gt; You will see it
[32:03] &gt;&gt; once you understand what happened
[32:05] &gt;&gt; in the unfolding of the seventh seal in
[32:08] your day.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So sometimes, and this
[32:11] just we're almost done with this
[32:12] introduction, when you get to the when
[32:15] you get to the types, you're going to
[32:17] see the actual threefolds.
[32:19] Sometimes you're going to see the
[32:21] victory under the seventh seal.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see the judgment.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see the conditions of
[32:27] the day.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see a character change.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see the purpose under
[32:34] the seven seal. Sometimes you'll see the
[32:37] revealing of both comingings, first and
[32:39] second, and the comparison, the
[32:41] differences.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see rapture and
[32:44] resurrection.
[32:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:48] You know something brother Daniel was
[32:51] saying last night and and I was
[32:52] wondering you know was he doing this on
[32:54] purpose? He was saying I'm becoming kept
[32:58] saying that. Did you hear that?
[32:59] &gt;&gt; I'm becoming here I am. I'm becoming.
[33:04] Do you know that's the actual meaning of
[33:06] Jehovah?
[33:08] &gt;&gt; Yahweh.
[33:11] Y
[33:13] vave.
[33:15] Yh.
[33:17] It does not just mean I am. I am means I
[33:22] am is English. Oh, I am Alistister. You
[33:24] know
[33:26] in the Bible I am means I exist.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; Right? It doesn't just mean I am.
[33:33] &gt;&gt; In the original Jewish text, Hebrew text
[33:36] it means I become.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; I am never in one state. I become. And
[33:42] then when he said when and Abraham said
[33:44] Jehovah Gyra, we just simplified the
[33:48] Lord will provide. Do you know what it
[33:50] means? Because it's added to Yahweh
[33:53] Jehovah. It means I asked it to be and
[33:57] here it is now.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Here I am.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; I asked it to be and here it is now.
[34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jehovah means I become. And the
[34:10] prophet simplifies it and said the
[34:12] selfexisting
[34:14] one.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; And all through we see the mystery of
[34:17] God, self-existing one, logos,
[34:21] theophony,
[34:23] man-made flesh,
[34:25] people, the bride of Christ, the church.
[34:28] It is all God becoming.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; That's what you've got to see. You've
[34:36] got to hold those thoughts in your mind.
[34:38] All right? So, are you ready to start?
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Right from the beginning.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to see those three
[34:46] folds.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; We're going to see the seven seal
[34:48] unfolding.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; We're starting right at the beginning,
[34:52] the book of Genesis. Every type will
[34:55] show it to you. So, what do we start
[34:56] with? Genesis 1, right?
[34:59] &gt;&gt; And and on to Genesis 3. We see this
[35:01] earth hurtling through the universe
[35:05] &gt;&gt; without form and void.
[35:07] It's not doing its purpose that God
[35:10] chose it for.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; It's a piece of rock and things on it.
[35:15] It's chaotic. It's hurtling through. It
[35:18] doesn't have any orbit. It doesn't have
[35:20] any control. What does God do? He's got
[35:23] a solution. His solution is light.
[35:27] Right?
[35:28] &gt;&gt; So, what do we see? The first coming of
[35:30] light.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; God.
[35:32] &gt;&gt; Now, we seeing coming,
[35:35] &gt;&gt; right? the comingings of the Lord, first
[35:37] coming of light. This is not the sun
[35:39] because we know that happened on the
[35:40] fourth day,
[35:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[35:42] &gt;&gt; So, we see this light, right? And and
[35:45] it's part of the first coming of light
[35:47] because he's going to bring this to the
[35:49] earth. But the first coming of light was
[35:50] the matter, the actual capability of it.
[35:54] And then we see that in the fourth day
[35:56] that light becomes the sun, the moon,
[35:58] the stars. What's it doing? It's
[36:00] bringing order to the earth. The earth
[36:02] starts getting its form. It gets its
[36:04] orbit. Can you see that?
[36:06] &gt;&gt; The earth is is now moving. It's
[36:08] revolving around the sun. This is like
[36:11] Christ.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. What happens? What happens when
[36:15] Christ comes the first time? Then come
[36:17] the stars, the messengers, the order,
[36:20] this chaotic world starts to come into
[36:22] order and we see this church forming and
[36:25] the real life of God starting to move.
[36:28] And we see people starting to see they
[36:30] used the Bible for governments. Every
[36:33] single government was transformed by
[36:35] Christianity.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; They were all in tribalism and terrible
[36:39] situation. And here is this this uh the
[36:43] first coming producing this order for
[36:45] the earth.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Animals start to grow. Uh plants start
[36:50] seeds begin to be sewn. Then what's the
[36:52] second coming
[36:54] of light?
[36:56] Genesis 1:26-27.
[36:59] Theophony of man.
[37:01] That's the light. That's the second
[37:03] coming of light.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; How do we know? John 1:1, in the
[37:06] beginning was the word. The word was
[37:07] with God and so on and so on. He is the
[37:09] life that lightth every man.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Right? Who is what is theophony? He is
[37:17] light. The logos, king Theophony. Now,
[37:20] the coming of man is the second coming
[37:23] of light. Remember we spoken on Thursday
[37:27] night how that man was sent to bring
[37:29] order on earth. The first coming of
[37:32] light brought order to the whole thing
[37:34] that was surrounding earth. But now man
[37:38] is the next coming of light to earth.
[37:40] And that should complete it.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; Now the coming of man had three folds.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; Genesis 1:26.
[37:48] Right.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; Theophony.
[37:51] There's everything contained in that
[37:53] theophony. two attributes in perfect
[37:54] harmony. Are you with us?
[37:57] &gt;&gt; Genesis 2:7, that theophony comes down
[38:00] and becomes one with the fleshly body.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; But there's he standing. He looks like a
[38:06] man.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; There's a mysterious element inside him,
[38:11] &gt;&gt; but he looks male. He looks masculine.
[38:14] Prophet said, "But in him was a secret,
[38:17] a feminine attribute which was not yet
[38:19] revealed. He put everything in order,
[38:22] put the animals in order, sorting things
[38:24] out, walking around, but something is
[38:26] missing. There's a mysterious element,
[38:29] the third fold of the mystery, the
[38:31] unspoken part, the unknown language.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; God puts him to sleep, brings out the
[38:37] last manifestation of light.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; And that's the second coming in the
[38:42] first type.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Unmistakable.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; It's there. Amen.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Did you see anything that resembled the
[38:51] Pentecostal idea of the coming?
[38:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; So, let's go to the next. So, this what
[38:58] was the secret? What was the secret?
[38:59] What was the mysterious element? The
[39:01] woman.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Because with and and watch I could go on
[39:05] with that type. How do they become what?
[39:08] Separate them and brought a marriage.
[39:10] The first marriage
[39:13] &gt;&gt; the two become one flesh.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; As long as that marriage holds.
[39:18] The mystery is complete. The
[39:20] manifestation is revealed.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; It was the marriage covenant that made
[39:24] them co-equal.
[39:26] &gt;&gt; They walked around wherever they went to
[39:29] placing things in divine order.
[39:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Abraham, right? So in
[39:37] Abraham, we see Genesis 15, Abram, well
[39:40] before that Abram is called from um of
[39:43] the Chaldes. He makes his way. You you
[39:45] follow it. You follow every chapter,
[39:47] every verse. It's unmistakable,
[39:51] &gt;&gt; right? He comes with Lot. We heard last
[39:53] night. He he brings it down. He comes to
[39:56] Genesis Genesis 15 and there's the first
[39:58] coming. That's the first time he sees
[40:00] God.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Right? Prior to that, it was just a
[40:03] voice.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Go to Canaan.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; No manifestation, nothing. Genesis 15
[40:11] comes the covenant. I will make you a
[40:13] father of many nations. You will receive
[40:15] us the promised son. Experience the
[40:16] promised son from your own bowels. And
[40:18] then God comes down in a pillar of fire
[40:21] and moves in the in the form of an eight
[40:23] between the pieces, the two altars,
[40:26] right? Separated. And God makes a
[40:28] covenant with him. Immediately after
[40:30] that first coming, Genesis 16, what do
[40:32] we see? A false church arising,
[40:34] persecuting the real bride,
[40:36] &gt;&gt; Hagar,
[40:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:38] &gt;&gt; And then you, in other words, your
[40:40] church ages are beginning,
[40:41] &gt;&gt; right? And then we see chapter 17,
[40:45] Ishmael, the firstborn son, the
[40:47] Pentecostals, receiving the
[40:49] circumcision,
[40:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Enjoying it for a long time.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; Genesis 18, we see the appearing of the
[40:57] Lord,
[40:59] &gt;&gt; on the plains of memory,
[41:01] &gt;&gt; the messianic sign,
[41:03] &gt;&gt; the prophet, the appearing before the
[41:05] coming proving that it's about to
[41:07] happen, the promise is about to be
[41:09] fulfilled. Genesis 18, he comes there.
[41:12] We see the discernment. We see it
[41:13] happening now. It's a turn turn his back
[41:16] &gt;&gt; that
[41:17] &gt;&gt; brother, that sister. You've seen it
[41:19] happen. Amen. And then now we already
[41:22] know
[41:24] after the first coming, Abraham's stream
[41:27] of life which was dead is now healed.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; Which means the male is already
[41:31] producing seed. How how do we know?
[41:32] Because he produced a son through
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Hagga,
[41:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:38] &gt;&gt; But Sarah's still not healed.
[41:40] So after this this message starts coming
[41:42] forth. This is how we know it's a
[41:44] process
[41:46] &gt;&gt; because there Genesis 18, Genesis 19,
[41:48] Genesis 20 what happens there life is
[41:52] going on. God reveals so many things to
[41:55] uh to Abraham. We see Sodom and Gomorrah
[41:58] being judged. We see the two witnesses
[42:02] um Paul Roberts Billy Graham going out
[42:05] to the world to the lost. We see that
[42:07] right?
[42:09] And then we see Sarah and Abraham going
[42:12] into a land of Aimilec.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; And Aimilec falls in love with this
[42:18] &gt;&gt; this woman.
[42:20] And and no offense to our wonderful
[42:22] people who are older than me, but the
[42:26] prophet said Aimilec was not going to be
[42:30] fall in love with a 90-year-old granny.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; Something happened. Yeah.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; That means her body was changing.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Waiting for the last
[42:41] manifestation. And then Genesis 21 says,
[42:44] "And the Lord visited Sarah
[42:47] &gt;&gt; according to the time of life, according
[42:49] to his set time,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; second coming of the Lord, as promised,
[42:56] &gt;&gt; bringing forth the son, the Christ child
[42:59] in the bride,
[43:04] &gt;&gt; the barren womb has been opened."
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Perfect type.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Any Pentecostal idea of the coming
[43:15] &gt;&gt; the types don't reveal that
[43:17] &gt;&gt; right? Let's go to Isaac and Rebecca.
[43:19] This is just beautiful. I don't know. We
[43:22] could spend hours on just this one,
[43:24] &gt;&gt; but you know it. There is Abraham. He's
[43:26] a type of the father. Eliza is a type of
[43:28] the prophet. Isaac is a type of the son,
[43:31] Christ.
[43:32] &gt;&gt; Rebecca's the type of the bride. You all
[43:34] got it?
[43:35] &gt;&gt; So, he sends the prophet. He says, now
[43:39] the first thing we see in this type is,
[43:40] do you see Isaac does not physically in
[43:44] a corporal body of his own set foot in
[43:47] Mesopotamia.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Isaac himself does not come physically
[43:53] in a corporal body to Rebecca
[43:56] &gt;&gt; in her land.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; The coming to her through the prophet,
[44:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:05] Eliza makes his way.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Now message time of decision. Watch the
[44:10] three foes. The prophet said, "I believe
[44:13] in time of decision that the angel
[44:17] &gt;&gt; beat Eliza there by about half an hour."
[44:20] [Music]
[44:23] &gt;&gt; And told her,
[44:25] &gt;&gt; "It's time to go and get water."
[44:29] &gt;&gt; First fold,
[44:31] &gt;&gt; right? The second fold has got to do
[44:33] with the prophet.
[44:35] &gt;&gt; He comes there, he puts forth a mystery.
[44:36] And this is wonderful uh uh tradition
[44:39] that they had there. At that time, you
[44:41] know, it's not like today we all meet up
[44:42] at church and we see a girl we like, a
[44:44] boy we like. No, at that time the
[44:46] culture was the ladies of of a
[44:49] respectable house would not be seen
[44:51] walking in the streets. But there was an
[44:53] evening time where they would dress up.
[44:56] They would carry their water pots. They
[44:58] would walk with the maidens and all the
[45:00] the eligible suitors would sit near the
[45:03] wells and regard them
[45:07] and then see the one that they thought
[45:10] they could make a marriage to and then
[45:12] they would ask. That was the tradition
[45:15] at that time. So Eliza positioned
[45:17] himself at the right place. Came there
[45:20] the wells outside the city. That's the
[45:22] right place. Not inside the city
[45:25] &gt;&gt; where the disrespectful ones were.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; This was the respectful tradition.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; So he positions himself. Now who sets
[45:33] forth the mystery? The prophet.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Lord, he prays. Let it be.
[45:40] &gt;&gt; It's got to be according to how he put
[45:42] it out.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; So he's not just going to come out and
[45:45] say it all out. There's a mysterious
[45:47] element to it. There's an unspoken part
[45:50] &gt;&gt; that she's got a catch.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; He But that between him and the Lord,
[45:54] it's known.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Right. I seen it happen.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; I seen it unfold into them thunders.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; We're not right there at that cycle
[46:03] right now, but we're moving into that
[46:04] cycle.
[46:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he puts forth the mystery.
[46:07] Here she comes. And this is the
[46:09] character of the bride. Now, you know,
[46:12] this wasn't this fairy tale well with
[46:13] these bricks there and a little roof and
[46:16] a crank handle like this and a bucket
[46:18] going down. No, these were a hole,
[46:21] massive hole dug down to the water table
[46:24] with circular staircase going down like
[46:27] that. This wasn't just bringing up one
[46:29] jug of water for this prophet to drink
[46:33] and for camels. 10 camels
[46:37] &gt;&gt; who drink. Well,
[46:39] &gt;&gt; you should know, right?
[46:42] &gt;&gt; She had to water all the camels.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't have time to go into all
[46:47] the types, but she's got to water the
[46:49] prophet. That means she's got to
[46:51] recognize him.
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Then she's got to recognize the ministry
[46:55] that's going to take her to the
[46:56] bridegroom,
[46:57] &gt;&gt; which is the camels.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Now, there's so many scriptures in
[47:02] there. So anyway,
[47:05] &gt;&gt; she now says or um he asks her flat out
[47:08] after she completes the unspoken
[47:10] language.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; She uh he says, "My master Abraham has a
[47:15] son and I've come to seek a bride and
[47:19] you are her.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Uh will you come?" He says, "I need to
[47:26] go and say goodbye to my family and get
[47:29] my things." No resistance.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] So watch the continuous manifestation of
[47:35] the third fold. She goes to the family,
[47:38] the family's happy. Wow, it's a marriage
[47:39] happening. Fantastic. But why don't you
[47:42] stay 10 days?
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Remain here in this denomination.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; We're okay with this. Remain in the old
[47:48] tradition and the old thinking. Let's
[47:51] come fellowship with us. Come. And and
[47:54] Elisa is getting antsy. Anxiety. No. No.
[47:57] I need to go. My master Abraham. I'm the
[48:00] reason why I'm telling you this. my
[48:01] master Abraham. He's calling Abraham the
[48:03] master, the master, the master. And my
[48:06] master's son, he's waiting for his
[48:07] bride. We've got to go now. Under the
[48:10] third pole,
[48:12] it says, "Let the maiden speak."
[48:18] &gt;&gt; The first time I I don't know if you
[48:21] know Eastern tradition, the maiden
[48:22] doesn't have a voice.
[48:24] &gt;&gt; Everyone makes the decision for her.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; This is the first time. Let the maiden
[48:29] speak. She said, "I will go."
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And she'll receive all the gifts
[48:35] pertinent to the bride at that moment.
[48:38] The cuffs, the earring, the garments
[48:41] from the prophet. And off they go.
[48:43] &gt;&gt; Now, did you notice on the way? I'm not
[48:46] going to cover all that. You know it
[48:48] all. Did you notice how the um the ch
[48:52] the verses in the Bible match the years?
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Right. Genesis 24. If you haven't, I'm
[48:59] sure you you probably have, but Genesis
[49:00] 24, I'm just going to refer to it.
[49:02] There's a reason why I didn't put
[49:04] everything on the screen because we're
[49:05] going to be flying through so many
[49:07] scriptures.
[49:09] Genesis 24 and verse 62. Now, look at
[49:13] this happening because the prophet
[49:15] starts receiving a vision in 62. Now,
[49:18] you remember in 62, he starts the year
[49:20] 62 with presuming. We should not
[49:23] presume, do not adventure into uh
[49:26] without authority. remember all that.
[49:28] Don't venture without authority. Then he
[49:30] comes up with this meme vision at the
[49:33] end of 62 and he he starts the time with
[49:38] we're presuming.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Is it this? Is it the thunders? Is it
[49:43] that? Is it this? Is it that? Maybe it's
[49:46] this. Maybe it's this way. He's messed
[49:48] up in his mind. He's perturbed. He
[49:51] thinks maybe it's my death.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Right? This verse says this the time. So
[49:57] he ends up presuming he's in a terrible
[49:59] state of affairs, but something is
[50:02] happening. Something is fixing. What
[50:04] happens here in verse 62? And Isaac came
[50:08] from the way of the welly for he dwelt
[50:11] in the south country. So if you look at
[50:13] Israel, the wellroy, by the way, leeroy
[50:16] means the well of the one seeing me.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; He's seeing me. He makes the first move.
[50:25] He's going to make the first move. What
[50:26] does he start doing? So, he's in the
[50:28] south. Actually, it's southwest.
[50:31] And he starts moving east.
[50:36] Isaac starts moving east. He, you know,
[50:38] how long the journey is from Mesopotamia
[50:40] coming down from the north, moving
[50:42] towards uh um uh the plains of memory.
[50:45] It's a long journey. How does he know
[50:48] that it's about time? Well, obviously
[50:50] he's seeing me.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; I know nothing,
[50:54] &gt;&gt; right?
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Verse 63. And Isaac went out. There are
[50:58] 63. Isaac went out to meditate
[51:03] &gt;&gt; in the field at the even tide.
[51:07] Sign in the heavens. February 28. Isaac
[51:10] goes out first. Amen. First fold. And he
[51:14] lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold,
[51:17] the camels were coming. He sees that
[51:20] word that brings the bride.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; That's what he's seeing, right? He's
[51:25] seeing it happen. That's the first part.
[51:28] 64. And Rebecca lifted up her eyes. Are
[51:31] you seeing the visions happening?
[51:34] &gt;&gt; She lifts up her eyes and she doesn't
[51:37] see anything else. She sees this man.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; And when she saw Isaac, she lighted off
[51:43] the camel.
[51:46] &gt;&gt; She had to get off. what she was
[51:48] traveling on for a long time.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; She sees it and gets off the C. It's a
[51:53] monumentous occurrence.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Whatever we've been dealing with in the
[51:58] past, something is changing.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; We've been walking with Eliza so long.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; They developed randomism. Yes, we might
[52:07] as well say it.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Message religion,
[52:11] &gt;&gt; all of that. But now it's time to get
[52:12] off the camel.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:15] But 65,
[52:18] she turns to the prophet unto the
[52:21] servant and said, "What man
[52:27] is this?"
[52:31] She didn't say, "What clout?
[52:34] What man is this?" This shows a
[52:36] revelation of the word becoming flesh.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; That's the question.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; What man is this?
[52:44] Right? And the servant had said it is my
[52:49] master.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say my master's son.
[52:55] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; The entire chapter, my master Abraham,
[53:00] my master's son Isaac.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; When the bride and the groom have come
[53:05] together,
[53:06] &gt;&gt; he becomes the master.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Because the manifestation of the word is
[53:11] incomplete without the bride.
[53:13] Amen. And only then when the when the
[53:16] two matching pieces, the one who's
[53:18] revealed and the mysterious element are
[53:20] brought together is when he becomes the
[53:23] master.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; How do we know? Because Christ when he
[53:25] came the first time, he wasn't the
[53:27] master.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Right?
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Why? Because Satan's standing there and
[53:30] says, "Bow down to me and I'll give you
[53:32] the kingdoms of the world."
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Which means the kingdoms of the world
[53:35] were not belonging to him yet.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Get thee behind me,
[53:39] Satan." What happens in the seventh
[53:41] trumpet? Right.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Now are the kingdoms of the world become
[53:46] the Lord and his Christ.
[53:49] [Music]
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to bring the two matching
[53:53] pieces together and then he is the
[53:56] master.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; He is complete by us. Glory to God. And
[54:01] you see then 66 well the prophet passes
[54:04] away.
[54:06] 66 fellowship between the prophet and
[54:09] the Lord. I've done everything, Lord.
[54:12] It's done. It's over. And we never see
[54:13] him again.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; We never see him. It's all now about
[54:17] Isaac and Rebecca.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Isaac brings his uh Rebecca
[54:22] into his mother's tent.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful for that?
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; There's the types.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Any Pentecostal ideas in there?
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Is your heart burning?
[54:35] &gt;&gt; All right. How about Jacob? Look at
[54:38] Jacob. This guy is a suppler. He's a
[54:41] deceiver. He's a bad guy,
[54:44] &gt;&gt; right? I'm speaking to you now.
[54:47] The coming of the Lord is personal to
[54:49] you.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; He lied. He cheated. He didn't just lie
[54:53] to his brother. He lied to his father.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; He disguised himself. He put goat hair
[54:59] on him
[55:00] &gt;&gt; to look like his brother.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; His brother asked him, "Is it you?"
[55:04] Esau. Yes.
[55:07] Yeah, you smell like him. But the voice
[55:09] sounds like Jacob. No, I'm Esau. I'm
[55:13] your firstborn. I want the blessing. He
[55:16] was a bad guy,
[55:18] &gt;&gt; but he wanted the blessing, right?
[55:21] &gt;&gt; Now, this man, as bad as he is, he seems
[55:25] to keep meeting angels.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; He goes to the house of God. He's
[55:31] running away. He's He's a coward. He's
[55:33] running away from his brother because
[55:35] his brother sought to kill him. First
[55:37] place, first coming to Jacob, Bethl.
[55:41] He's laying on a pillow.
[55:44] Jacob's ladder we call it. Opens up. He
[55:47] says, "Surely God has been in this
[55:48] place." He names it Bethl. First coming
[55:51] of God to him, he keeps on going. Where
[55:53] does he go? Off to find uh some place of
[55:57] refuge. There he finds his wife. We know
[56:01] the story. He gets tricked. He gets two
[56:03] wives. Then he tricks his father-in-law
[56:05] again,
[56:07] &gt;&gt; pulls all the cattle with him, amasses a
[56:10] great uh uh uh uh uh business, and then
[56:14] starts going back home. Now, he knows
[56:16] he's a promised son. He's got the
[56:18] birthright. He's got the blessing. He
[56:20] has to take his place. So, but he's a
[56:23] coward. You know what he does? He puts
[56:26] his wives in front, the children in
[56:28] front, the cattle, the livestock, and
[56:31] he's right at the back. He wants them
[56:33] all to appease Esau. And by the time
[56:36] they get to him, it's going to be all
[56:37] right. We forgive you. I seen all I've
[56:40] seen your sons. Oh my, I can't kill you.
[56:42] Now look at this. He wants them to he
[56:45] wants Esso to be appeased. And it's at
[56:47] that moment he reaches pineal,
[56:51] second coming of the Lord to Jacob. What
[56:54] does he see at pineal? Pineal means I
[56:56] have seen God face to face.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; It means facing God. And this coward
[57:04] wrestles with the angel.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; And says, "I will not leave you until
[57:11] you bless me."
[57:13] &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. Don't
[57:14] think of an actual You know what
[57:16] wrestling is, right?
[57:18] &gt;&gt; Wrestling is not kung fu and all that.
[57:20] This is wrestling is grappling. Yeah,
[57:22] &gt;&gt; you got to grab a hold of someone, get a
[57:25] good foothold,
[57:26] &gt;&gt; and try to overthrow him.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; That's wrestling. So, I mean, can't God
[57:32] beat a human?
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Can't an angel beat a human? And the
[57:37] Bible says Jacob was prevailing?
[57:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; This is what happens under the seventh
[57:44] seal. A true son of God is not going to
[57:47] let go.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Reveal it to me, Lord. I'm not moving.
[57:52] I'm not satisfied with what everything
[57:53] is going on. I'm not satisfied with who
[57:55] I am. And the bride is prevailing.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; And finally, the angel relents. Okay.
[58:01] Okay. Enough is enough.
[58:03] Name change.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Facing God and
[58:11] my life is preserved.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; How about Joseph?
[58:15] Look at Joseph. The Joseph perfection.
[58:18] Are you still with me?
[58:20] We all know Joseph is a type of of
[58:22] Christ beginning to end. Watch the
[58:26] mystery. Tell me again if you're seeing
[58:28] any Pentecostal idea in there, any
[58:30] denominational idea in there. So here he
[58:33] is. We spoke of it on Wednesday on on on
[58:35] Thursday. We saw him receiving the seven
[58:38] coat and so on. And watch the brothers.
[58:40] They throw him in the pit. Three days
[58:43] first coming right after that. They sell
[58:46] him to the Gentiles. Gentile church ages
[58:48] start to open up,
[58:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[58:51] &gt;&gt; What happens in the dark ages? He ends
[58:53] up in prison.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; Three days he there he meets the baker,
[58:58] the butler. The word is about the the
[59:00] the written word is about to die. But
[59:03] the wine of revelation is going to
[59:04] survive.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; But at the end, there's a sevenfold
[59:08] mystery.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; To bring Joseph out of captivity. A
[59:13] seven-fold mystery comes up and it's so
[59:16] mysterious. The pharaoh himself forgets
[59:20] &gt;&gt; and needs a man
[59:22] &gt;&gt; praise God
[59:23] &gt;&gt; to reveal
[59:24] &gt;&gt; not only reveal but even tell the vision
[59:28] &gt;&gt; right and what does the vision open up
[59:30] seven fat ears of corn seven lean ears
[59:32] of corn seven fat cows seven lean cows
[59:36] seven seals seven trumpets
[59:39] &gt;&gt; how do we know because it's going to
[59:40] take the seven lean to call the brothers
[59:43] &gt;&gt; the seven seals to the bride is the
[59:45] trumpets to Israel
[59:47] So what happens is he comes out. Here's
[59:50] this Hebrew. He in his second coming
[59:54] he's changed to a gentile.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; They shave off all his hair.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; He clothed in Egyptian garments. Stands
[1:00:02] before the pharaoh.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; Receives the preeminence, the ring, the
[1:00:07] throne, the knee that should bow, the
[1:00:09] trumpet, the chariot. And what is he
[1:00:12] doing? Storing up food.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. storing of food. He
[1:00:17] receives a bride, a gentile bride who
[1:00:20] happened to be a part of the priestess,
[1:00:23] right? But there she is and this
[1:00:25] beautiful uh type begins to unfold and
[1:00:29] then come the trumpets.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; You can see now the second coming to the
[1:00:34] Gentiles is different to the second
[1:00:36] coming to Israel.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; So he's still a Gentile.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; Now what happens is uh the the
[1:00:43] Israelites come to him, the brothers.
[1:00:45] Here's all the brothers coming, right?
[1:00:47] But little Benjamin is not there yet.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; He's working with them. He brings them
[1:00:51] in. He starts revealing to them tribal
[1:00:53] order.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Puts them around a table. Tribe. They
[1:00:57] were messed up. Puts them in tribal
[1:00:59] order. Puts them through things. Starts
[1:01:00] giving them blessings. They give him
[1:01:02] money. He gives back the money. He fills
[1:01:04] their sacks with grain. Right?
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; And then finally
[1:01:09] comes the testing.
[1:01:11] He tricks them. Bring Benjamin. When
[1:01:14] Benjamin comes in, he puts Benjamin
[1:01:16] under tribulation. Silver cup of
[1:01:18] redemption in his sack. Says, "He's
[1:01:20] mine. You go back. Here's my prisoner."
[1:01:24] What's must what must happen? The one
[1:01:26] who actually sold Jacob uh uh Joseph
[1:01:29] must now repent.
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; Who was that? Judah.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Said, "My Lord, you cannot do this. This
[1:01:35] will break the father's heart. Take me."
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; The nature changing. And it says he
[1:01:43] couldn't contain himself anymore.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; He takes off the Egyptian garments.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; He reveals, I am the Christ.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, I'm the brother you sold. But
[1:01:55] this had to happen for a reason.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; There's the comingings of the Lord.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; In the type of Joseph,
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; but you know that.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. How about the
[1:02:09] Exodus?
[1:02:11] Crossing over of the Red Sea,
[1:02:15] right?
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; First coming of the Lord brings
[1:02:18] repentance, putting Egypt behind you,
[1:02:20] washing away the Egyptians by a great
[1:02:22] mighty manifestation. Passover token was
[1:02:27] beautiful, right?
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; Then starts church ages, wilderness
[1:02:31] walk,
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; That's it. Go have a look at it. That's
[1:02:35] you. You whenever you come to salvation
[1:02:38] then start your wilderness walk.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; You'll see everything in your life.
[1:02:42] Kora, day ever water from the rock,
[1:02:45] mana, quailes. You'll see wonderful
[1:02:48] things. You'll see the tabernacle being
[1:02:50] set up. You'll see the priesthood coming
[1:02:52] alive. You'll see the law coming in. But
[1:02:55] when it comes to the second coming,
[1:02:58] Moses goes up to the mountain. Nebo
[1:03:02] looks upon the promised land. Notice the
[1:03:05] prophet does not go into the promised
[1:03:08] land
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; with the bride.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; He dies before.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; He gets taken away before. But he sees
[1:03:14] the full vision.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; I saw it unfold into them thunders.
[1:03:19] We're not there yet. We're waiting for
[1:03:21] that great one to come upon the scene.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; So the opening of Jordan is the opening
[1:03:26] of the seventh seal.
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; And what happens when you open Jordan?
[1:03:29] There's no prophet
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; leading you. There's no Moses standing
[1:03:36] there with a staff. You've got to step
[1:03:38] in by faith.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Where's Joshua? He's somewhere.
[1:03:43] He's not leading them. He's somewhere
[1:03:45] amongst them.
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; He He didn't put his step in his foot in
[1:03:49] first. And then what happens? Jordan
[1:03:51] opens.
[1:03:53] They put rocks inside. They put rocks on
[1:03:56] the outside.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Open and sealed evidences. Yes.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then they cross over. Now what
[1:04:04] happens when they cross over? This is
[1:04:07] the word to to the the children of
[1:04:09] Israel says be strong and courageous.
[1:04:14] You have not walked this way before.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; You have not walked this way before.
[1:04:22] What comes by the opening of the seventh
[1:04:24] seal is some a new field.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. you've never known before.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; But be strong and courageous.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; You know what? Being strong is not No,
[1:04:35] no, no, no. We must say exactly what the
[1:04:37] prophet said,
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; or else you must Where's the quote,
[1:04:42] brother? Where's this? We'll show you by
[1:04:44] the end. You're going to have no proof
[1:04:46] to prove to somebody.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; You have to step in by faith.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; We see something else happen in this
[1:04:56] type. Remember the first the mystery of
[1:05:00] it all is these people crossed over
[1:05:03] through the seventh seal into the
[1:05:05] promised land not having the
[1:05:07] circumcision.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Why? What happened? The Pentecostal
[1:05:16] circumcision happened in Egypt as 8-day
[1:05:19] old babies.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Baptism of the Holy Ghost came with
[1:05:23] kicking, screaming emotions.
[1:05:26] What happens under the baptism of the
[1:05:28] Holy Ghost under the seventh seal? It's
[1:05:30] mature men.
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; It's painful.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; It's stay in your tent until you are
[1:05:38] healed.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; And then roll away the reproach of
[1:05:42] slavery
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; of Egypt. You cannot be an inheritor if
[1:05:46] you still feel like a slave.
[1:05:48] &gt;&gt; You cannot have that spirit of slavery
[1:05:50] on you. You cannot take the land unless
[1:05:52] you have the mark of Abraham. Amen.
[1:05:54] Amen.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Stay there.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; Circumspect.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; Introspection.
[1:06:01] Stay in your tent.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; I'll meet you in there.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Get healed.
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; And then let's go and take Jericho.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; I want to show you this particular
[1:06:14] thing. There's so many things I can tell
[1:06:16] you like you'll see the the first and
[1:06:18] second coming in the manner that fell in
[1:06:21] the wilderness and the quailes. What was
[1:06:23] the mana? Brother man said morning food.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Quails was evening food.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Evening food comes with a cloud that
[1:06:31] comes out of the sea moves in. And what
[1:06:33] we see in there is the character of the
[1:06:35] people. They started eating.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Wrong.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; There were very few who ate the evening
[1:06:42] food correctly.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Go have a look. But I don't want to go
[1:06:47] into that now. I want to get into the
[1:06:49] tables of stone. How many tables of
[1:06:52] stone were there? Two. How many
[1:06:54] comingings of the tables of stone? Two.
[1:06:57] What happened with the first table of
[1:06:58] stone?
[1:07:01] It was broken. It was Calvary.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because of the sin of the
[1:07:06] people. Exodus 24 1-4 in verse 4 it says
[1:07:09] and ro and or rather this is important.
[1:07:13] In the first tables of stone it was
[1:07:16] written by the finger of God.
[1:07:19] That's Christ
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; written by the finger of God. The word
[1:07:24] written in that man, by God himself, not
[1:07:27] born of anything else, but born by the
[1:07:29] prophecy of God, a virgin shall
[1:07:31] conceive.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; And when Moses came down the mount, he
[1:07:35] saw this this wreck of human behavior.
[1:07:38] He crashed those stones. Those tables
[1:07:41] were sacrificed. Amen. to bring
[1:07:43] salvation to them because they were not
[1:07:45] ready to receive
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; him.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; What happens?
[1:07:52] Moses then has to go and get the second
[1:07:55] tables of stone.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Second coming of the tables.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And Moses come told the people all
[1:08:01] the words of the Lord, the judgments. Uh
[1:08:03] Exodus 24:4. And Moses wrote all the
[1:08:05] words of the Lord, rose up early in the
[1:08:07] morning, builded an altar under the hill
[1:08:09] and 12 pillars according to the 12 uh u
[1:08:12] tribes of Israel. He goes up, he gets
[1:08:13] the first tablets, he comes back down.
[1:08:16] We know what happens. What happens under
[1:08:18] the second coming of the tablets? Exodus
[1:08:22] 34 1-5. The Lord said unto Moses,
[1:08:26] now the prophet is involved in the
[1:08:28] second tables of stone. Amen.
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; Moses, he thee two tables of stone like
[1:08:34] unto the first.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; And he says, "And I will write upon
[1:08:40] these tables the words that were in the
[1:08:43] first tables."
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put what was in the first
[1:08:48] coming into the second tables of stone.
[1:08:51] Glory to God. And be ready in the
[1:08:54] morning.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Come to the Mount Si. Present thyself to
[1:08:59] me on the top of the mount,
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; the prophet,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; And no man shall come with thee,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; neither let any man be seen throughout
[1:09:09] all the mount, neither let the flocks
[1:09:11] nor hers or anything. And what does
[1:09:13] Moses do? Moses used the two tables of
[1:09:17] stone like unto the first. And Moses
[1:09:20] rose early in the morning and went up to
[1:09:22] Mount Si, took in his hand at two
[1:09:24] tables. And the Lord descended in the
[1:09:27] cloud
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; and stood with him there
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; and proclaimed the name of the Lord, the
[1:09:34] new revelation.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; And the Lord passed before him.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And proclaimed the
[1:09:41] Lord, the Lord God, merciful and
[1:09:44] gracious, long-suffering, abundant. He
[1:09:46] revealed himself to him. That's right.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 27. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[1:09:54] "Write thou these words."
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; It's the prophet that wrote.
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; That's what happens in the second
[1:10:04] tables.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; And he was there with the Lord 40 days
[1:10:07] and 40 nights. He did neither eat bread
[1:10:10] nor drink water. He wrote upon the
[1:10:12] tables the words of the covenant, the
[1:10:14] ten commandments. And Moses whisp not
[1:10:17] that the skin of his face shone while he
[1:10:20] talked with him. Unveiling of God. What
[1:10:23] was it about?
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Says I can see in one hand the amount of
[1:10:29] people getting it here. He said
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; you're not getting it.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Said you see when Moses stepped in, when
[1:10:36] Moses came out, it wasn't Moses.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; It was only after he spoke the word, he
[1:10:41] then returned back to Moses.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. What was that? That's what was
[1:10:46] happening under the seventh seal
[1:10:48] &gt;&gt; in our day. A son of man revealing the
[1:10:51] son of man.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; That fold that was God descending.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; That word had to now become flesh in the
[1:10:57] people.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; And you know the original thing was in
[1:11:05] in 2 Corinthians 3:3
[1:11:08] uh for as much as you are manifestly
[1:11:10] declared to be the epistle of Christ
[1:11:12] ministered unto us written not with ink
[1:11:15] but with the spirit of the living God
[1:11:17] not in tables of stone but in the
[1:11:19] fleshly tables of the heart.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; That's the fullness of it all. Right?
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Let's move bo move over to Joshua. So
[1:11:28] all the way through the the wilderness
[1:11:30] walk, what was happening? We had this
[1:11:33] pillar of fire, pillar of cloud. We had
[1:11:35] these signs and wonders. God speaking to
[1:11:38] Moses by, you know, the vision, by the
[1:11:42] voice, by the signs and wonders and so
[1:11:44] on. When they cross over into the
[1:11:46] promised land, the prophet says the
[1:11:48] pillar of fire disappears.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; You don't see it anymore. Anybody had
[1:11:54] don't believe anyone who's taking
[1:11:55] pictures and saying the polarify is with
[1:11:57] them.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Just stay far away from that.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; The polarify does not pose for pictures.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; If the purifier appears, there's a
[1:12:05] there's a reason and such a good reason.
[1:12:08] And let me tell you, the purifier
[1:12:11] appears with you in a picture, your life
[1:12:13] is never going to be the same.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; You're going to hit the ground when you
[1:12:17] stand up. You're never going to be the
[1:12:19] same. And you're not going to come out
[1:12:21] and preach some wrong doctrine after you
[1:12:22] got a picture with a pillar of fire.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; So stay far away from that.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; The type says in the promised land, the
[1:12:29] pillar of fire disappears.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; The prophet said the pillar of fire
[1:12:34] becomes a man
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; in the promised land.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; What happens?
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; They come out of Gilgal. They receive
[1:12:42] the the baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[1:12:44] the seventh seal. A different kind of
[1:12:46] baptism, a different kind of emotion.
[1:12:49] Amen. not the same as Pentecost. And
[1:12:51] Joshua is preparing for this great
[1:12:53] Jericho. Think of yourself. What is
[1:12:55] Jericho to me personally?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; I was born with strongholds
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; in my life. Walled, cities, walls that
[1:13:03] they could run chariot races on. The
[1:13:05] enemy had so entrenched himself by my
[1:13:07] genes, my genetic codes, my cultures, my
[1:13:11] race, my traditions. He was stuck in
[1:13:13] there. There was nothing to break those
[1:13:15] things down. That's how strong and so
[1:13:18] confident was the enemy, right?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Joshua comes before this. He's standing
[1:13:22] there. He's looking at this whole city.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; What do we do?
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; And there he's sees a man.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; That plurifier becomes a man.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; Right. It's a man.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; He knows it's a man because he takes his
[1:13:38] sword.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Declare, are you for us or are you
[1:13:41] against us? Right?
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; And he says, "Nay, but as the captain of
[1:13:44] the host am I come." And Joshua would
[1:13:47] never bow down to just any man.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; That means he recognized in this man the
[1:13:53] lamb himself,
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; God himself. I must submit to it.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; So what does this man do? I mean, he's
[1:14:01] the captain of the host. Why didn't he
[1:14:02] just send a wind and blow Jericho down?
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; Why? He can do anything, right? Yeah.
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Pillar of fire, open the Red Sea,
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; stop the chariots. He can No. No.
[1:14:13] Because the third fold is about you.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; It's about your victory.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; So all that this man does, the son of
[1:14:21] man being revealed is he gives Joshua
[1:14:24] the master plan.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; You need a plan to break down those
[1:14:30] strongholds.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; And watch this master plan. It's
[1:14:33] unbelievable
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; but believable.
[1:14:36] Amen. Glory to God. That's unbelievable
[1:14:40] for many, but for us, it is the word of
[1:14:42] God.
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; So, we know with um with Jericho, we see
[1:14:49] these these very very thick walls. We
[1:14:52] see this um these uh these people
[1:14:55] standing on on the walls looking down.
[1:14:57] We see this this king. He's this
[1:15:00] foundation of lies, of deceit. But
[1:15:04] there's also a Rahab in there with a
[1:15:06] scholar thread waiting for something to
[1:15:08] happen. Right? So what happens is when
[1:15:11] they cross over and conquering Jericho,
[1:15:14] uh he gives them the breakdown, the
[1:15:16] master plan, right? What are the walls?
[1:15:18] Walls of sin, walls of indifference,
[1:15:20] walls of tradition, walls of doubting,
[1:15:22] walls of man-made systems. And we need a
[1:15:25] master plan for God to reveal himself to
[1:15:27] us. Do you believe that?
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; You can find this in Joshua 6:1. And it
[1:15:31] came to pass, or rather, let me just
[1:15:33] give you the the breakdown of it. Seven
[1:15:36] days it's going to take to break down
[1:15:37] this thing.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Seven ages, seven messengers, seven
[1:15:41] trumpets, seven seals, hidden
[1:15:44] revelations unveiled. On the seventh
[1:15:46] day, there'll be seven manifestations,
[1:15:49] just one banging after the other,
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; right? And on the seventh day will be
[1:15:56] the last trump.
[1:15:58] Right? I don't want to labor it, but I
[1:15:59] want to tell you. So you've got they're
[1:16:01] marching around first six days. Can you
[1:16:04] imagine those people first day all
[1:16:08] shields, swords, spears, standing on the
[1:16:12] wall, everything ready, archers, and
[1:16:14] these people are just
[1:16:18] walking, singing, blowing or just
[1:16:21] walking around the wall. After they're
[1:16:23] done, they go back to the camp, sleep it
[1:16:25] off. Next day, same story. Six days. By
[1:16:28] the third day, they were like shields
[1:16:30] down. Listen, we got this. By the sixth
[1:16:34] day, they must have been having deck
[1:16:35] chairs and cocktails. And you know,
[1:16:38] these people, these message people, my
[1:16:41] they don't know what's happening. On the
[1:16:43] seventh, the enemy's defenses became
[1:16:46] relaxed.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; On the seventh day,
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; they marched around seven times.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; It's a massive city. seven times with
[1:16:56] about two million people.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; That's what happens. You're going to
[1:17:00] sweat it out. Yes,
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; They march around and this is what I
[1:17:05] want to bring you to. Here's your here's
[1:17:07] your shout voice trump.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Right. You know the rest. I don't have
[1:17:11] to labor that. But I want to ask you
[1:17:12] this question. They were told to shout,
[1:17:15] but they were not told what to shout.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; The shout came from within them. They
[1:17:22] would just say when you hear that you
[1:17:25] shout.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; The mystery was in the shout because
[1:17:28] when the shout came forth the walls
[1:17:30] crumbled.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; It is all within you.
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Do you love him,
[1:17:38] saints?
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; How about Gideon?
[1:17:42] Gideon, the sword of the Lord and of
[1:17:45] Gideon and the coming of the barley
[1:17:46] loaf.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; The people, you know the whole story.
[1:17:50] The fleeces. You can see the two
[1:17:52] comingings there, two fleeces. You can
[1:17:54] see uh the two water tests. You can see
[1:17:56] that happening. But let's move to the
[1:17:58] battle. Here's your Midianites. They're
[1:18:01] like grasshoppers. This is not a this is
[1:18:03] an uncommon enemy, right?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Filling the valley.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; And the the 300, there's just so few of
[1:18:10] us, Lord, in the second coming.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Everyone's against us. Everyone's left
[1:18:15] the message. There's so many defectors.
[1:18:17] There's just so few of us. And what do
[1:18:19] we have? Shout voice trump. How's this
[1:18:21] going to work? Light within an earn
[1:18:24] vessel and a trumpet.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And something to shout,
[1:18:30] right? But still, it's a little bit
[1:18:32] unnerving, but something is happening
[1:18:34] under the seventh seal. Gideon says,
[1:18:36] "Well, let's take a walk down to the
[1:18:37] enemy camp." He walks down to where the
[1:18:41] soldiers are guarding, right where those
[1:18:43] seals are tightly bound. Something's
[1:18:46] happening. There's a man there says,
[1:18:47] "You know what? I had a dream. It's
[1:18:49] really getting to me.
[1:18:51] This weird dream. So I see this barley
[1:18:54] loaf rolling down the mountain and
[1:18:57] taking out our tents. And the other man
[1:18:59] says, "Yeah, well you know that's just a
[1:19:01] dream. Can you imagine two soldiers just
[1:19:04] talking around the fire?" Says says,
[1:19:06] "This is surely the sword of Gideon.
[1:19:12] Even the enemy has a revelation of
[1:19:13] what's happening. I'm about to be
[1:19:16] routed. this. We're feeling this. Yeah.
[1:19:18] It's unsteady. Once Gideon heard that,
[1:19:21] the confidence came in. It was revealed
[1:19:24] what the seal was, what the enemy was.
[1:19:27] It's unveiled. Break every seal out.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; The enemy is shaken.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; And then they stand and take the battle.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Break the earn vessel.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; Let your light so shine.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Blow the trumpet. Bring the shout. The
[1:19:43] enemy is destroyed. the enemy destroys
[1:19:46] itself.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; How about Samson? Samson, you'll see the
[1:19:49] comingings in the beginning. You'll see
[1:19:52] it with the uh the betrayal of a of a
[1:19:55] wife, then going through the the church
[1:19:57] ages. And you'll see Samson. He comes to
[1:20:00] Delilah, by the way, which means feeble.
[1:20:02] It's terrible. Someone feeble trapped
[1:20:04] him. But anyway, here's Delilah and she
[1:20:08] asks, "What is your secret? Tell me who
[1:20:11] you are. What's the secret of the
[1:20:12] coming? What's going on? And you see he
[1:20:16] he lies to her. He doesn't tell her the
[1:20:17] truth, but he's kind of like there.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; If you tie me with seven green widths,
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Two ropes,
[1:20:29] right?
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Legalism, liberalism. You see what
[1:20:32] happened? Then he comes to my seven
[1:20:35] locks of hair. If you tie those things
[1:20:37] up and every time he takes out the
[1:20:42] Philistines, eventually he reveals the
[1:20:46] seven seals,
[1:20:47] right? There's it all. And what do the
[1:20:50] people do? What does the enemy do? Start
[1:20:52] taking the very thing he preached and
[1:20:55] start confounding and bringing weakness
[1:20:58] and trapping the people for several
[1:21:00] years since that happened and blinds
[1:21:03] him. puts him in this in this place
[1:21:05] where he's just uh uh uh grinding the
[1:21:08] corn, sharing it with with a donkey. But
[1:21:11] while this is happening, the hair is
[1:21:13] growing.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; The hair is growing. When it's finally
[1:21:17] grown, he feels the strength. But what
[1:21:20] about the seven thunders? It's no longer
[1:21:22] platted into seven. It's nothing
[1:21:25] definitive,
[1:21:27] but it's there.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; No one can tell you first of this,
[1:21:31] second under this. He had that seven
[1:21:34] locks, but now there's that those
[1:21:36] thunders that's going to give him
[1:21:37] strength to bring down his enemy. And he
[1:21:39] brings down the enemy with his death,
[1:21:41] with his sacrifice, with his surrender
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; more than he did with his life.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; How about Ruth? You know the whole story
[1:21:50] of Ruth? Husband
[1:21:53] died, first coming. You are not married
[1:21:56] to the one who died. You're married to
[1:21:58] the one who resurrected. Romans chapter
[1:22:01] 4. I just want to get to this one point.
[1:22:04] She goes down to the threshing floor. Do
[1:22:06] you understand the significance of that?
[1:22:09] Boaz was shocked because this bride did
[1:22:12] something she was not supposed to do.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; The threshing floor was for men. If any
[1:22:17] woman came in there, she would have been
[1:22:18] seen as an elf famed woman.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; A woman doing something that was not
[1:22:22] right.
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; Which is why everyone will speak against
[1:22:26] you because you're going down to the
[1:22:28] threshing floor.
[1:22:30] How dare you say you're equal to him?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; How dare you say you're a part? Are you
[1:22:37] trying to make yourself God? That's what
[1:22:39] you're doing by saying the bright coming
[1:22:41] of Christ.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; You know all of that.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; And she gets in there in the secret of
[1:22:46] the night. She goes down in secret in
[1:22:48] the silence and she she says, "Cover
[1:22:51] me."
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Cover me wasn't because she was feeling
[1:22:55] cold.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; That was mystery speaking. Yes.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Cover meant
[1:23:00] take me as your wife,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; produce seed, and give me my
[1:23:03] inheritance.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; And Boaz understood
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; the mystery language.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; Said, "The entire city knows you are a
[1:23:10] virtuous woman. You cannot leave now.
[1:23:13] Yes, lest you risk being seen. Go just
[1:23:16] at the at the dawn and I will go and do
[1:23:18] the rest." He goes into the third fold
[1:23:21] and breaks out the enemy. brings the
[1:23:23] enemy and says, "Listen, if you want to
[1:23:26] here's your your first husband of your
[1:23:28] false nature. If you want to bring seed,
[1:23:30] you've got to relinquish that life to
[1:23:32] Christ and give everything over to him."
[1:23:34] And the first that old nature says, "I'm
[1:23:36] sorry. I cannot do that. I'll risk my
[1:23:39] own inheritance. The flesh won't take
[1:23:41] it."
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Then off with his shoe,
[1:23:45] throw it down." He says, "I will take
[1:23:47] it." And he relinquishes everything. The
[1:23:50] one who's resurrected brings back the
[1:23:52] inheritance to the bride and fulfills
[1:23:54] everything that was meant to be
[1:23:56] fulfilled.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:23:58] &gt;&gt; Second coming.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's saints. There's David and
[1:24:03] Solomon. There's so many others. Have a
[1:24:06] look at Elijah and Elisha. You know
[1:24:08] Elijah and Elisha. Elijah was the
[1:24:10] prophet. He was given three commissions.
[1:24:12] He only fulfilled one. The rest of the
[1:24:14] commission was given to Elisha.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; I want you to bring bring it to this
[1:24:17] point. He tells Elisha, who's a type of
[1:24:20] the bride who receives the mantle. He
[1:24:22] says to Elisha, uh, Elisha says, "How is
[1:24:25] it going to happen? How's the rapture
[1:24:27] going to take place?" What? He says,
[1:24:28] "Well, it depends on what you see.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Everything depends on what you see.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; You'll receive the mantle if you see the
[1:24:38] right revelation.
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And when the time, where does it happen?
[1:24:42] Jordan.
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Years before there were open evidences
[1:24:46] and closed evidences in there. They
[1:24:48] crack those waters. He opens it up. The
[1:24:51] first part is done by
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Elijah.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; They cross over.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Then on the other side, the bride
[1:24:58] receives the same ability to crack it
[1:25:00] open again.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; He comes across. Amen. Of course, he
[1:25:04] sees said, "My father, my father, the
[1:25:06] chariots of Israel and and the horses
[1:25:09] thereof." He sees the right revelation
[1:25:11] and the mantle falls upon him. The
[1:25:13] revelation, the rapture is a revelation
[1:25:16] to the bride. She will see it.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; He comes over and here's all the
[1:25:20] prophets standing there. All the
[1:25:21] studious ones. He said, "Where is
[1:25:24] Elijah?"
[1:25:26] said he's he's gone. Where is his
[1:25:29] corporal body?
[1:25:33] He said, "Uh, no, you can go look if you
[1:25:36] want. You're not going to find it."
[1:25:38] They went across.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; I don't know how they went through their
[1:25:42] seven seal. They must have taken boats
[1:25:43] cuz they didn't have the mantle to crack
[1:25:45] it open.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; So they went across the seven seal
[1:25:47] however they want to. They searched and
[1:25:49] searched and searched for a physical
[1:25:50] body. They came back said, "We found
[1:25:52] none."
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to elaborate on that. You
[1:25:55] should be catching that. But where was
[1:25:57] the coming of the Lord? In the man
[1:25:59] standing there with the mantle of
[1:26:01] Elijah. He goes off and completes the
[1:26:04] mystery. He anoints Jahu who will take
[1:26:07] down Jezebel the system of religion
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Ahab and then he he brings Haziel right
[1:26:15] the Syrian king he completes the mystery
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; that is the part of the bride the the
[1:26:22] mystery unfolding the the the the
[1:26:24] unknown language
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; the part that was meant for hermenise
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; are your hearts burning
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; and you know what happens
[1:26:35] The revelation stays with Elisha.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Is that right? When the Syrians when
[1:26:40] when when those people the soldiers were
[1:26:42] surrounding the city,
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Elisha was relaxing.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Gazi the servant said, "My Lord,
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; we're in trouble." He said, "Lord, open
[1:26:52] his eyes.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Watch this." I remember in your Sunday
[1:26:56] school kids, remember they showed you
[1:26:58] all the the the chariots of the Lord on
[1:27:01] the mountains? That's not biblical
[1:27:05] because the Bible says his eyes were
[1:27:08] open and he saw the angels of the Lord
[1:27:11] around Elisha
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; all around the prophet. They stayed with
[1:27:18] him. That revelation stays with him.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Now we see Elisha's dying. Here comes a
[1:27:25] servant coming in and my lord, you know
[1:27:26] the story. says, "Take a bow and shoot
[1:27:29] it out the window." At the deathbed,
[1:27:32] this servant says, "My Lord, my lord, my
[1:27:35] father, my father, the chariots of
[1:27:37] Israel, the revelation remains with him
[1:27:40] all the way to the end."
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; That dimension of heaven never leaves
[1:27:44] him.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Because once you see in the revelation
[1:27:46] of the rapture, it remains with you
[1:27:48] right to the very end.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; Let's close this down. Esther. Now, you
[1:27:55] know how many types we've already left
[1:27:57] out, right? Esther is beautiful. I was
[1:27:59] listening to the brothers talking about
[1:28:02] it. Absolutely wonderful. The glory of
[1:28:03] the bride. There's so many things in
[1:28:05] there how she was brought in. But, you
[1:28:07] know, there's a prophet Mori,
[1:28:09] right? Who tutors her,
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; brings her up to speed, brings her to be
[1:28:13] the bride. You know, we heard about
[1:28:15] Vashi last night. Uh she forsook uh the
[1:28:19] king's commandment. Here comes the bride
[1:28:21] in. Right. And now salvation of mankind
[1:28:26] depends on her.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Morai says to her,
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; "I'm sorry. You've been having a
[1:28:31] comfortable life so far. You've been
[1:28:32] enjoying that first and second pull too
[1:28:34] much."
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; It's time to do what you were called to
[1:28:39] do.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; You were called for this moment.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; Now, here's what happens.
[1:28:45] The king happens to be Now, you know how
[1:28:47] it works, right? There's the outside and
[1:28:49] you come in. There's a chamber where the
[1:28:52] advisor sit. There's another chamber and
[1:28:54] then there's the king's chamber. And the
[1:28:56] king was in his chamber, wait for it,
[1:28:59] for about 30 days.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; There was silence.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; Nothing was happening in the court. The
[1:29:07] rule was anybody stepped in their
[1:29:09] certain death unless the scepter was in.
[1:29:11] You know the story. She dresses in her
[1:29:13] wedding garments.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; She steps into silence.
[1:29:19] And here's the beautiful part. You know,
[1:29:21] I love how the way the Bible's written.
[1:29:23] He doesn't she doesn't God bless you, my
[1:29:25] king. Greetings in this in the name of
[1:29:26] the precious Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:29:28] Christ. And he just shouts out, "Esther,
[1:29:30] my queen. Ask anything.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Third pull.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Ask anything and I'll give you equality
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; even to the half of my kingdom."
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; She hasn't even asked anything yet.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; She hasn't even made a request. She
[1:29:46] steps into silence and he offers her
[1:29:48] equality.
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; You are equal with God. All you have to
[1:29:53] do is ask for it.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; Hold on, my king. I want to invite you
[1:29:59] to a banquet of wine.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; A banquet of wine. Because under this
[1:30:05] bride dispensation, she's got to bring
[1:30:07] the enemy to the table
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; with God.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; She says, "And I'd like you to bring
[1:30:13] Hmon, too." Yeah,
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; my queen. And he leaves silence.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; He was sitting there with nothing
[1:30:20] happening. He was contemplating whatever
[1:30:22] he was contemplating, but he breaks the
[1:30:24] silence to come to the banquet of wine
[1:30:27] with the bride.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; Bring the enemy to the table. Here they
[1:30:31] are sitting there. She's speaking. She's
[1:30:34] serving them. The enemy is feeling so
[1:30:36] happy. He's got a plan in his mind
[1:30:38] because he's secretly working against
[1:30:40] the prophet Mori. He started building,
[1:30:44] you know, um, gallows. He's ready to
[1:30:47] sacrifice him on YouTube, on the
[1:30:49] internet. He's doing everything he can.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; He's he's going to kill this Morai. He's
[1:30:54] got a plan working and his wife is
[1:30:56] working with him, right?
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; For sure.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:31:03] he's looking comfortable. He's enjoying
[1:31:05] himself. So, they leave. That night, the
[1:31:09] king has a troubling sleep. He wakes up.
[1:31:12] He says, "How many of you when you have
[1:31:15] a troubling sleep, you go call for all
[1:31:16] your records to be read?"
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; Well, anyway, that's what he done. Read
[1:31:21] the records. Maybe that'll help me get
[1:31:23] some peace. And there comes the story of
[1:31:25] Mori.
[1:31:27] This man saved me from an assassination
[1:31:29] plot. What has been done for him?
[1:31:33] Well, here's what I want you to do. I
[1:31:34] want you to grab Hmon and glorify Mori
[1:31:38] before all the people.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; This is before the second banquet of
[1:31:43] wine that he's about to be called to.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; And there of course what happened. No
[1:31:47] matter what they said about him,
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; he is glorified.
[1:31:52] &gt;&gt; Mori,
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; and here's what happens.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Beautiful, right? Calls, she calls him
[1:31:59] to a second banquet of wine. Now it's
[1:32:01] time. Now it's telling time. They're
[1:32:05] talking and then she's it's her time to
[1:32:08] speak. It's the third pull time. Now at
[1:32:10] the first banquet of wine, I I negated
[1:32:12] to tell you this. The king comes in
[1:32:14] again. They hear his greeting. As my
[1:32:18] queen, ask anything
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; even to the half of my kingdom. From the
[1:32:23] very beginning of silence, ask anything.
[1:32:27] Third pull. Say what it is. Ask anything
[1:32:30] and you will get co-equality. that
[1:32:32] banquet. He says the same thing. The
[1:32:34] next the banquet, the second banquet of
[1:32:36] wine, he he comes in again. As the my
[1:32:40] queen, ask anything and I will give you
[1:32:43] even to the half of my kingdom. Under
[1:32:45] the second coming, he is presenting
[1:32:48] co-equality.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Like brother Chad was saying last night
[1:32:52] 12 was brother Daniel 127 nations to
[1:32:57] offer co-equality.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Half of his kingdom. It's a big deal.
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; So at the second banquet of wine, she
[1:33:05] says, "My Lord, this is it.
[1:33:09] There's an enemy against our people.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; They're fighting against the seventh
[1:33:13] seal. They want to destroy us." He gets
[1:33:16] angry. He gets so angry, just walks out,
[1:33:21] right? And right there,
[1:33:23] she she identifies the enemy. You You
[1:33:27] are against my people. You are against
[1:33:29] Mori. you're trying to destroy me. And
[1:33:32] the the enemy bows down before the
[1:33:35] bride,
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; pleading
[1:33:38] mercy falls on the bed. And at that
[1:33:42] time, the king walks in.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Says, "What? In my presence, you will
[1:33:47] fall down on my wife's bed." Yeah.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; And I like the way it says, "While the
[1:33:52] king spoke, they covered his face."
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Took him out, put him on the same
[1:33:58] gallows that they had rejected the
[1:33:59] prophet on
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; and killed him.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happens thereafter?
[1:34:06] Ahazerus lays a tribute. What's a
[1:34:08] tribute? A scroll upon the land and the
[1:34:12] sea.
[1:34:14] The scriptures are perfect. Amen.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; He lays a tribute on the land and the
[1:34:18] sea and says everyone
[1:34:21] is subject to the message of Mori.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; It's all there
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; and nothing is denominational idea of
[1:34:32] his coming. It's all there scripture by
[1:34:36] scripture.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Starting with Moses,
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; he revealed to them everything
[1:34:41] pertaining, excuse me, to himself.
[1:34:45] You go back in there and you see
[1:34:46] yourself.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; You love him, saints.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; In closing,
[1:34:57] the first coming of Christ is probably
[1:35:00] the greatest of all types.
[1:35:03] Amen.
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; The greatest of all types because what
[1:35:08] you see there, I mean those who say his
[1:35:10] coming is an instant and whatever. So,
[1:35:12] the first coming was 33 and 1/2 years.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; The first coming was
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; The first coming was the star in
[1:35:18] Bethlehem.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; It was Mary the angel. It was Zechariah.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; It was uh um uh uh it was uh uh John the
[1:35:28] Baptist. It was turning water into wine.
[1:35:32] It was Zakius. It was blind Barnameus,
[1:35:36] the woman at the well. It was everybody.
[1:35:38] Right? Yeah.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; What do you see there? Is the coming an
[1:35:42] instant to everybody?
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; when he came to Nathaniel, was the
[1:35:47] coming to Zakius?
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; When he came to Zakius, was the coming
[1:35:52] to B blind bottomas?
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; When he was blind Barameus, was the
[1:35:55] coming to the woman at the well?
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; When the woman at the well hadn't seen
[1:35:59] the coming, did it mean he was not
[1:36:01] there?
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Of course, he was there. But the seventh
[1:36:06] seal has to be open to the individual.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; That's what happens under this mystery.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Only when it's revealed to you is the
[1:36:14] coming to you. Which is why we never you
[1:36:16] don't get stuck with saying 63 February
[1:36:18] 28th. No.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; Of course, there's a global thing, but
[1:36:22] the coming is personal to every person
[1:36:26] who is called by the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:28] in this last day.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Look at what happens.
[1:36:32] Here's John the Baptist. He's the
[1:36:34] prophet, right?
[1:36:35] He's standing in the water. Something is
[1:36:38] revealed to him.
[1:36:40] What is it going to be? Is it going to
[1:36:42] be my death? Is it this? Is it that?
[1:36:44] You're going to be introducing the
[1:36:46] Messiah. But what happens? He's standing
[1:36:48] there in water. He's doing what he's
[1:36:49] supposed to do. He sees the sign in the
[1:36:51] heavens.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; That vindicates the word.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; He says, "It's my Lord.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that taketh away
[1:37:01] the sin of the world."
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Then first fold. Then the Lord joins him
[1:37:05] in the water.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Pro the prophet said God and his prophet
[1:37:09] becoming one there
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; in the water in the word.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; Can you accept it?
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Can you see what happened? They're going
[1:37:16] to say the the prophet is making too
[1:37:18] much of himself.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; What what happens there? That's not some
[1:37:21] story. He says, "Lord, I'm not worthy of
[1:37:23] this. Me baptize you.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; A son of man revealing this son of man
[1:37:28] suffer it to be so."
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; To fulfill all righteousness. Amen.
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; Christ descending. God descending and
[1:37:37] then he goes out and he's left the scene
[1:37:40] and he's finding the bride
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; individually.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; While the prophet is continuing
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; and you know the prophet said and they
[1:37:49] ask why does brother still talk about
[1:37:51] the coming after the coming the coming
[1:37:53] he says you see what happened with John
[1:37:55] the Baptist the forerunner he introduced
[1:37:58] him he ends up in prison. Yeah.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; He said he's seeing what's happening
[1:38:02] around him. You remember 64 when he said
[1:38:06] I'm It feels like I'm preaching to souls
[1:38:08] in prison.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Is that the third pull? I've done this.
[1:38:14] We preached the seal. Something should
[1:38:15] have happened. Do you not see? Perhaps
[1:38:18] it's he it's in that message that he
[1:38:20] says the seven seal brings him back to
[1:38:21] earth.
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; Feels like the last part he's preaching
[1:38:23] to souls in prison. He says uh maybe the
[1:38:26] last one has already come in.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Can it be? You know this. Go read the
[1:38:30] message if you haven't.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I hope it hasn't.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Here was John in prison and he said,
[1:38:38] brother Ram says in COD question and
[1:38:41] answer. He said that eagle eye got
[1:38:42] filmed over.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; He said he sent his his disciples to say
[1:38:49] go and ask him are you the one?
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; Why he was anointed to be the forerunner
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; when he was not revealing the seals in
[1:38:57] that time? when he was not Eliza, he was
[1:39:01] still a seventh messenger.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; The seventh messenger is always going to
[1:39:04] say, "He's coming. He's coming. He's
[1:39:06] coming." Because he was still talking to
[1:39:08] Leodysia. In one message, you see
[1:39:11] seventh messenger,
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Eliza,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; a son of man revealing the son of man.
[1:39:16] It just depends on who you are
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; when you're reading
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; because when you're reading, you'll have
[1:39:22] a different experience.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; And then he'll be Elijah. If you read it
[1:39:27] and you say, "I hate this man." Well,
[1:39:30] then you're reading as Jezebel.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; I can't stand him. He picks on me.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And then or I don't like him. He keeps
[1:39:39] taking everything. Well, that's Ahab,
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; right? Everything from me. He's always
[1:39:46] persecuting me. But if you're the bride,
[1:39:49] it's Eleaza. It's calling. It's a son of
[1:39:52] man revealing this son of man. Glory to
[1:39:54] God. So you can see whatever you want to
[1:39:56] see in there but the bride knows who he
[1:39:58] is.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; I want to close it with this one very
[1:40:02] very significant point. Amen. Few
[1:40:06] minutes.
[1:40:07] The mystery of his first coming was his
[1:40:11] death.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; That's the part that was not revealed.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. The government
[1:40:19] shall be upon his shoulder. All the
[1:40:21] prophecies in there. His coming. His
[1:40:24] coming. is coming. Remember there the
[1:40:26] the revelation they had of his coming.
[1:40:28] The prophet said he was going to be so
[1:40:30] many feet tall. He's going to have a
[1:40:32] spear a mile long and
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; take all the Romans out and redeem
[1:40:36] Israel. Remember that. That was their
[1:40:38] revelation of his coming.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Sounds very much like the fantasy the
[1:40:41] denominations have of the coming of the
[1:40:43] Lord today.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that, right?
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; And he he came not the way they expected
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; in humility. God hiding himself in
[1:40:52] simplicity and revealing the same.
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; That's how he came. Amen. So here
[1:40:59] there's a mystery. He came to die.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; The Messiah.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; That seven thunder part of his coming
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; they could not deal with.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; It fooled everybody. They were even
[1:41:15] standing there saying, "If you are him,
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; get yourself off the cross
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; because we know that's what you're
[1:41:22] capable of.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; He willed himself to be there."
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; That spirit to leave him to get heaven.
[1:41:29] He had to die a man.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him, saints?
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; That third fold. So, here's what
[1:41:36] happened. Watch the descent. He's
[1:41:39] suspended between heaven and earth at
[1:41:42] Calvary.
[1:41:43] What happens when he's suspended? It was
[1:41:45] the word exposed for the world to see.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; And the word says, if I be lifted up,
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; I will draw men unto me. Right?
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; He hung there for a space of time
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; between heaven and earth, between two
[1:41:57] dimensions.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; It was for that moment of rejection.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; The world did not recognize him.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "It's our Lord up there." They
[1:42:11] said, "It's rocket
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; field."
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; The church rejected him.
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; The elect were unsure.
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; Standing there.
[1:42:24] How can this be? Hiding in the crowd.
[1:42:27] Peter denying him. The man with the
[1:42:29] revelation, thou art the Christ, the son
[1:42:30] of the living God, and says, "No, no,
[1:42:32] no, no. You know, I can't really say
[1:42:35] what it is.
[1:42:37] I'm not one of them, but I believe in
[1:42:39] the coming of the Lord.
[1:42:42] turmoil inside
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; because they don't know what to make of
[1:42:46] this.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; The church went through turmoil when
[1:42:49] everything started coming out. Oh yeah,
[1:42:51] it's rocket fuel. Oh, it's this. Oh,
[1:42:53] it's that. No, it can't be. And we got
[1:42:56] proof and proof and proof and pro. And
[1:42:58] the the silent church is just standing
[1:43:00] there. What's happening? What's
[1:43:03] happening? How can this be? Everyone,
[1:43:06] the the elders told us the rapture is
[1:43:08] going to take place so soon. The
[1:43:10] redemption was going to happen. What's
[1:43:12] going on? They all dispersed. The
[1:43:15] message split up.
[1:43:18] Peter goes back to nakedness on the boat
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; fishing back to where he was called
[1:43:25] from.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Everyone dispersed, separated, even the
[1:43:29] two on the way to Emmas. In the
[1:43:31] meantime, a second fold is happening. A
[1:43:33] glorious second fold. The son of man is
[1:43:36] descending
[1:43:38] further into the regions of the lost
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; because that seven seal is about to take
[1:43:44] away the power of death in hell.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. They did not know what was going
[1:43:49] on as a total mystery that he would do
[1:43:51] such a thing and he would take captivity
[1:43:54] captive.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; He goes, I like the way the prophet says
[1:43:56] in the atunement message. He walks down
[1:43:58] the corridor. There's those that knew
[1:44:00] him, there's those that didn't. And the
[1:44:01] other one is saying that's him. That's
[1:44:03] him. That's the voice that spoke to us.
[1:44:05] That's the one that told me this. And he
[1:44:06] takes the keys of death, hell, and the
[1:44:08] grave. And he comes back up in the
[1:44:10] resurrection. All the things that happen
[1:44:13] in the resurrection is the unknown
[1:44:15] language.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Remember that there's all these
[1:44:20] disciples, all the people there, and
[1:44:22] what are these two on the way to Emus
[1:44:23] said? You know, someone saw a vision of
[1:44:26] angels
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; and told us he's here.
[1:44:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on. Yeah.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; And we don't know what to believe. I
[1:44:35] mean, there's no quotes for it. I mean,
[1:44:36] the quotes are insufficient. And we
[1:44:38] didn't really believe them. And then the
[1:44:40] others went there and then they saw he's
[1:44:41] gone. But there's still no quote to say
[1:44:44] it
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; outright
[1:44:47] [Applause]
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; at the rising of the sun
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; on the the day after the Sabbath
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; in the bride age. Yeah, that's right.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; There's no we're not I don't know why
[1:45:00] they they're crucifying us for saying
[1:45:02] bride age. The prophet even says so.
[1:45:05] We're not in the Pentecostal age.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; They can't accept us. There's plenty of
[1:45:10] quotes. We're not Luther. We're not
[1:45:12] Wesley. We're not in Pentecost.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; We're out of that.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; The rising of the sun in the eighth day,
[1:45:19] which is going back to the original. A
[1:45:21] mighty angel descends from heaven, cries
[1:45:24] with a loud voice. You put it all
[1:45:26] together. In Revelations 10, Roman gods
[1:45:28] traditions are struck. Blind, dead,
[1:45:30] powerless. Angel rolls away a great
[1:45:33] heavy seal.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Glory. An elected woman sees him.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; Not as he was seen before.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; She's she's looking at the word. She's
[1:45:46] reading it. She's not sure what she's
[1:45:48] seeing.
[1:45:49] &gt;&gt; She says, "Have you seen my Lord?"
[1:45:54] He says, "Why seek ye the living amongst
[1:45:58] the dead?
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; He's not there.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; Where is he? Please tell me where you've
[1:46:07] laid him.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that revelation."
[1:46:11] Turns around
[1:46:13] name.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Mary.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Here am I.
[1:46:20] Glory to God. I'm in the right position.
[1:46:24] I know who I am. He knows who I am. He's
[1:46:26] called my name. Rabbi.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; That's what happens under the third
[1:46:32] fold.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Who knows this? Only the elect.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; Does the Pharisees know it? Does the
[1:46:40] outside church know it?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; No. In fact, the type says the rest of
[1:46:46] the church put out a lie.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. that was purported by the
[1:46:50] disciples
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; a false doctrine
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; to say he's come
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; and the lie was perpetuated
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; you want types here it is
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; they put out a lie to say he's come but
[1:47:05] they secretly stole his body they
[1:47:06] hatched up some revelation for
[1:47:08] themselves that's what was going on in
[1:47:11] the rest of the church but in secret
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; every elect was being called
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; and Everyone was having a different
[1:47:20] revelation of the coming.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; A personal revelation.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Here am I.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; I'm the best father,
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:47:34] &gt;&gt; Because that's the revelation to me.
[1:47:36] You're going to have one, too. You're
[1:47:38] also going to be the best father, but
[1:47:39] not the best father like me. You're
[1:47:41] going to be the best father like you.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; See? So the other one sees him, the
[1:47:46] others see him on the way to Emmas.
[1:47:48] Yeah. Then they they all sort of get
[1:47:50] gathered together by this mystery and
[1:47:52] they they get to this room. The one
[1:47:55] leaves there and he appears before
[1:47:57] Peter. Peter's naked in the boat, dives
[1:47:59] in the water, comes out and clothes
[1:48:01] himself. The coming brings him back
[1:48:04] restoration. Then they're all getting
[1:48:06] into this room and then he appears.
[1:48:09] They're afraid. What is it? Is it
[1:48:10] corporal body? Is it theophony? Where is
[1:48:13] it? starts revealing himself to them.
[1:48:15] No, it's not a ghost. It's me.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Come. And then there's some doubters
[1:48:20] there who said, you know what? I'll
[1:48:22] never believe it unless I see a quote.
[1:48:26] I'll never believe it unless I feel
[1:48:28] that.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; All he does is discern it.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Thomas,
[1:48:34] it is me.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Come and feel if you want. It doesn't
[1:48:37] say he did.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; It just fell on his face. Lord,
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; it is you. He saw the sign. He knew it
[1:48:44] was him.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; And then every other time he appears,
[1:48:47] he's there on the beach preparing fish.
[1:48:50] And they come and they're they just seen
[1:48:53] him
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; and now they're seeing another type.
[1:48:58] How is this working? Somebody else,
[1:49:00] Brother Chad preach, somebody else
[1:49:01] preaches. Is it really him? and they go
[1:49:04] up and he speaks and they recognize him
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; every time after the that that
[1:49:12] crucifixion, the resurrection, it's
[1:49:14] revealing himself to the individual in
[1:49:18] different ways, in manifold ways. And
[1:49:21] here's the truth of it.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; In his resurrection, he only revealed
[1:49:25] himself to the elect. Did they have any
[1:49:28] solid proof?
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; No. Could they convince anybody else?
[1:49:35] No. Only a personal experience
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; and the proof was within them.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if you think you're going to
[1:49:47] convince everybody.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; The proof is within you.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; It is all within you.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; There it is.
[1:49:57] all of the seven seal in just a few
[1:50:00] selected types and shadows.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; Go through it yourself. I'm telling you
[1:50:06] detail, verse for verse, you will find
[1:50:09] the seven seal manifested.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll have that experience.
[1:50:14] Did not our hearts burn within us?
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Go through it and tell me you don't have
[1:50:19] a burning heart.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; When what? When the scriptures
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; are made known. Amen.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They were not even saying
[1:50:29] their heart was burning when he was in
[1:50:30] the inn breaking the bread. Did not our
[1:50:33] heart burn within us when he spoke to us
[1:50:35] along the way, revealing to us the types
[1:50:38] in the shadows. The coming of the Lord
[1:50:40] was something hidden. It's a new fold we
[1:50:42] never knew before. He never revealed the
[1:50:44] time or the hour, but he has hidden it
[1:50:47] in every type and shadow of the Bible.
[1:50:50] It behooves you to go back in and walk
[1:50:54] the Emmas road and get the burning heart
[1:50:56] experience, saints of God. So now that
[1:50:59] we know all this, what now?
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; You know it, you hear it, you see some
[1:51:05] of it. What now? Don't try to make it
[1:51:08] up. Don't try to force it.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; What does your heart tell you?
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; You can listen to what I'm saying and
[1:51:15] you can be working things in your mind.
[1:51:17] Oh, he's saying things the prophet
[1:51:18] didn't say. or he's doing things we're
[1:51:20] not allowed to do. Who allows you to do
[1:51:23] anything?
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Who disallows you to do anything?
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; You possess the gates of the enemy. You
[1:51:29] handle the opening and the closing. What
[1:51:31] you say is what he allows. What you hire
[1:51:35] is hired. What you fire is fired. You've
[1:51:38] got to accept your place.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Do you have a burning heart?
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; What do you do?
[1:51:48] Surrender.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; With that, brother, we can close. God
[1:51:54] bless you. Surrender.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. As the musicians come up, let's
[1:51:59] bow our heads.
[1:52:11] Praise be to God.
[1:52:15] Dear heavenly father,
[1:52:17] how we love you,
[1:52:20] how we love your word.
[1:52:22] We give you all the praise and the glory
[1:52:24] and the honor.
[1:52:26] You alone deserve it.
[1:52:29] We've said a lot. We've been through a
[1:52:32] journey in the Bible
[1:52:34] and we appreciate your presence with us.
[1:52:38] Some of these things are a lot to
[1:52:39] digest, a lot to take in.
[1:52:43] But we realize that you called us for a
[1:52:45] purpose. You called us with a calling
[1:52:48] that this world cannot understand. And
[1:52:51] we admit there are times we were unsure.
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; We were nervous. We had anxiety. Maybe
[1:52:58] there were times we even denied what we
[1:53:00] were seeing. Like Peter,
[1:53:03] &gt;&gt; we did not maybe want to be brave enough
[1:53:05] to associate ourselves with what you
[1:53:08] were revealing. But your eyes of grace
[1:53:11] looked upon us with compassion.
[1:53:15] You forgave us for our shortcoming, our
[1:53:18] failure, and you brought us back unto
[1:53:20] yourself by a great manifestation in
[1:53:23] these last days. Precious Lord, we thank
[1:53:26] you for what you've done under the
[1:53:28] seventh seal. We see it. We see the
[1:53:31] descent.
[1:53:34] I suppose the hardest part is to accept
[1:53:36] that it ends with me.
[1:53:40] I've been given the call to ask and
[1:53:44] receive co-equality.
[1:53:47] Father, I pray that we may receive the
[1:53:49] grace to do so, to speak the word under
[1:53:52] this third pool, to take our positions
[1:53:55] to be what we're meant to be. Bless this
[1:53:58] church, Lord, its pastor, the people,
[1:54:01] the worship, the saints of God, the
[1:54:05] people around. Bless the churches around
[1:54:07] this area.
[1:54:09] You've blessed them with such wonderful
[1:54:10] ministries and great spirit among the
[1:54:13] people.
[1:54:14] I pray Lord that you would strengthen us
[1:54:16] now to move forward into this unknown
[1:54:20] language, this glorious part that is
[1:54:24] reserved for us. Blessed be your holy
[1:54:26] name.
[1:54:29] Thank you, Lord Jesus. We commit us now
[1:54:31] to you and the rest of this day. Bless
[1:54:34] brother Daniel as he would speak
[1:54:35] tonight. Anoint him, Lord.
[1:54:38] We ask it now in Jesus precious name.
[1:54:41] Amen. And amen.
[1:54:47] All to Jesus
[1:54:50] I
[1:54:52] surrender
[1:54:55] now. All to him I freely
[1:55:00] give
[1:55:03] worldly
[1:55:05] pleasures.
[1:55:07] Oh, forsaken.
[1:55:11] Take me Jesus.
[1:55:15] Take me. I surrender. Oh, I
[1:55:20] surrender.
[1:55:23] Oh.
[1:55:24] [Music]
[1:55:26] Yes. I
[1:55:28] surrender.
[1:55:31] I surrender all.
[1:55:34] All to thee, my blessed
[1:55:40] savior.
[1:55:42] I surrender.
[1:55:46] I surrender.
[1:55:49] Yes. I
[1:55:52] surrender
[1:55:54] all the chance.
[1:55:58] I
[1:56:00] surrender
[1:56:02] all
[1:56:04] [Music]
[1:56:07] to thee, my blessed
[1:56:12] Savior,
[1:56:14] I
[1:56:15] surrender
[1:56:18] all.
[1:56:20] Let's all stand.
[1:56:22] Oh, do you love the word?
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Is your heart on fire? Amen. As we
[1:56:28] walked through the scriptures and saw
[1:56:30] our day,
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; ourselves, our position, our story.
[1:56:35] Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I discussed with
[1:56:39] somebody one time, I think we were
[1:56:40] talking with brother Alistister, where
[1:56:42] is the seventh seal? I said, this is the
[1:56:44] seventh seal.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; It's the record of the seventh seal. The
[1:56:47] whole Bible is the seventh seal.
[1:56:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; It's in every shadow and type. And I
[1:56:53] just want to read one more scripture.
[1:56:54] So, I don't want to add to anything the
[1:56:55] brother said, but this is just burning
[1:56:57] in me. If we could go to Luke 24
[1:56:59] together, I just want to read one more
[1:57:01] thing cuz it's so precious to me.
[1:57:05] And we'll read the verse that Brother
[1:57:08] Alistister had us read in verse 32.
[1:57:11] Luke 24:32. And they said one to
[1:57:14] another, "Did not our heart burn within
[1:57:16] us while he talked with us by the way?
[1:57:19] And while he opened to us the
[1:57:21] scriptures?"
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Who opened the scriptures? He opened the
[1:57:24] scriptures
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; to us.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; But then they go and they run back and
[1:57:28] they tell the rest of the disciples the
[1:57:30] story and there's still some questions
[1:57:32] and Peter's seen him and they're
[1:57:33] gathered together and then he
[1:57:35] miraculously appears in their midst.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; And in verse 44 he says, "And he said
[1:57:41] unto them, these are the words which I
[1:57:43] spake unto you while I was yet with you
[1:57:45] that all things must be fulfilled which
[1:57:47] were written in the law of Moses and in
[1:57:50] the prophets and in the psalms
[1:57:51] concerning me." Then opened he their
[1:57:55] understanding that they might understand
[1:57:59] the scriptures.
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. When he was here through
[1:58:03] the prophet, he was opening up the
[1:58:05] scriptures. Amen. But when he comes in
[1:58:08] their midst, Amen. He gives them the
[1:58:10] understanding to understand the
[1:58:12] scriptures. Amen. That's why our brother
[1:58:15] could see the types and shadows. This
[1:58:17] whole Bible was written for our day.
[1:58:18] Amen. It's all a revelation of today.
[1:58:21] And I say, God, that prophet, through
[1:58:23] that prophet, you opened up the
[1:58:25] scriptures. But when you come in our
[1:58:27] midst, give us understanding to
[1:58:30] understand the scriptures that you've
[1:58:32] given to us. Oh, praise God. Then every
[1:58:35] time you read your Bible, your heart
[1:58:36] will burn. Amen.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; As he opens to you the word.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; What a day we live in, friends.
[1:58:45] Just want to say I feel like the most
