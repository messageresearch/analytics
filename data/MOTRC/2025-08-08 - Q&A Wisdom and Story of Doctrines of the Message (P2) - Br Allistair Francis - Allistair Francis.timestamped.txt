[0:00] Um, and this is going to be the uh the
[0:05] second coming. All right. So, now we're
[0:08] going to talk about the second coming of
[0:09] Christ, which is our day.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; So, when it comes to the message of the
[0:15] hour, I know a lot of you sitting here
[0:18] can think back and you will have a lot
[0:20] of negative memories. Some of you have
[0:22] no memories because you're just you're
[0:24] from here.
[0:26] You came here. You started here.
[0:30] So you you don't even know what I'm
[0:31] talking about. Some of you sitting here
[0:34] may be thinking,
[0:36] uh, do I even have to hear this? Yes,
[0:39] you do. All right?
[0:42] Because if you don't, you are going to
[0:45] encounter this anyway. And you're going
[0:47] to learn why these things had to be.
[0:52] So it is it's like saying, you know, uh,
[0:54] say,
[0:56] I don't need to, brother. Well, then why
[0:58] read the Bible and learn what happened
[0:59] in the Old Testament?
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah, true.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; What's the fear of learning what's
[1:04] happened in your day? That's the worst
[1:05] thing you can do is not know what
[1:07] happened in your day, but you're so
[1:08] excited about hearing what happened in
[1:10] the New Testament and Old Testament.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; But what's more relevant to you is what
[1:14] happened in your day because this is
[1:16] where you're actually living.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; So don't be that kind of person.
[1:21] Um there is enough that we have that we
[1:26] have been through for us uh in this
[1:29] message to develop complexes.
[1:33] When I meet you, some of you from
[1:36] wherever you come from, I can tell when
[1:38] you have complexes. I can tell what
[1:41] complexes you have because I can tell by
[1:44] your attitude to the word, by your
[1:46] attitude to people, what it is that's
[1:48] been affecting you through your life.
[1:50] I would even be able to to pinpoint
[1:53] pinpoint exactly which doctrine you
[1:54] started in. That's how easy it is to
[1:57] diagnose. You can just look at a person
[2:00] and know, oh, okay, seven thunders, oh,
[2:04] okay, Peruia, okay, seals are not open,
[2:08] okay, stay with the ABCs.
[2:11] You just know it, right? So, I want to
[2:14] do something for our children's
[2:16] generation to make them know what it is
[2:19] that our elders went through and why
[2:22] certain doctrines came about. cuz I
[2:24] don't know some of you will come in and
[2:26] and you'll say
[2:28] I don't understand the message is
[2:29] supposed to be this wonderful thing that
[2:31] reveals who God is and yet we all are so
[2:34] divided and and brother so and so speaks
[2:36] against brother Alistister and some say
[2:38] this about him and and some say this
[2:40] about that brother and that brother and
[2:42] and is it true and what what what must
[2:45] we believe and what do we do with all
[2:47] this right that's going to happen of
[2:50] course if your faith is in brother
[2:51] Alistister you're going to fail tell you
[2:53] that right Now
[2:56] &gt;&gt; why? So that is our uh there are things
[2:59] that our elders went through and and we
[3:02] need to know why those doctrines came
[3:03] about and basically know our story that
[3:06] brought us to where we are today. Would
[3:09] you like to hear that?
[3:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; So I want to tell you the story of the
[3:12] message and how it progressed with
[3:14] doctrines from my perspective of living
[3:17] in South Africa. And uh I'm my
[3:21] perspective is not just living in South
[3:22] Africa. I've also traveled to the United
[3:24] States and different parts of the world
[3:26] and met believers there. And um because
[3:28] I'm like a sponge, I I sit with them. I
[3:31] ask them questions. I listen to their
[3:33] stories and um I take it all in. I make
[3:36] notes about it and and I remember all
[3:38] the details. Okay. So I want to tell you
[3:41] the story
[3:43] um from the perspective of living in the
[3:46] in the message in South Africa. And uh
[3:48] for me I can remember everything since I
[3:51] was 5 years old.
[3:54] Okay. Even slightly before that when my
[3:56] mom and dad were in a Pentecostal church
[3:59] I can I have memories right up till 4 3
[4:02] years old. I I can remember I even
[4:05] remind them of things that they've
[4:07] forgotten.
[4:08] So yes, I want to begin by going through
[4:12] the doctrines some that was mentioned by
[4:14] the brother but but there's actually
[4:16] more right and uh if time uh goes on
[4:21] we'll get more and more and more right
[4:24] so I want to begin there and show you
[4:26] how I want to go through each one show
[4:28] you how they developed what their
[4:30] effects were that they brought to the
[4:32] message churches and then tell you the
[4:34] story of how they came together. All
[4:37] right, let's go to the list of doctrines
[4:39] of the message. Um, and I put in there
[4:43] this
[4:44] important thing on the top regarding the
[4:47] seventh seal because in everything else,
[4:50] if you if you speak to any message
[4:51] believers, we're the same on water
[4:53] baptism,
[4:55] mostly the same on Godhead,
[4:58] mostly the same on serpent seed and
[5:01] dressing and many other things. We might
[5:03] have slight fluctuations and differences
[5:06] here and there, but on the ground on on
[5:09] on the ground level of the message, we
[5:12] basically all the same. This is why when
[5:14] we meet one another, we say, "Hey, God
[5:15] bless you, brother." Even if we don't
[5:16] like him because of what he believes in
[5:18] the seventh seal, we have some common
[5:19] ground. God bless you, brother. How you
[5:21] doing? How's the church? Oh, nice, nice,
[5:24] nice. And then inside it's like 5
[5:26] minutes is enough. I want to leave now.
[5:29] But he's a believer. But you can barely
[5:32] stay with him for like 5 to 10 minutes
[5:34] to fellowship because it already started
[5:35] to make you uncomfortable. You'd be
[5:37] thinking, well, I hope he doesn't start
[5:38] talking about his doctrine, you know.
[5:41] And then uh the moment he says
[5:42] something, you think now I have to push
[5:44] back. I got to let this go. Right?
[5:48] So number one,
[5:52] seven thunders are seven voices of seven
[5:54] men who continue the word of Malachi 4
[5:58] after his death.
[6:00] Number two, the church goes up in
[6:03] Revelations 3 and returns in Revelations
[6:05] 19. Everything in between is to Israel.
[6:10] Number three,
[6:12] seventh seal is not open and thunders
[6:14] not revealed. Stay with ABCs. Number
[6:18] four, seven thunders are the seven
[6:20] virtues. Number five, return ministry.
[6:25] Number six, Peruia.
[6:29] To some of you, that might sound like a
[6:31] perfume or cologne or something. No idea
[6:34] what that is. And number two, number
[6:37] seven, two lords.
[6:40] Number eight, the Lord himself came in
[6:42] 1963. We are in the millennium already.
[6:45] Number nine, the bride coming. And
[6:48] number 10, press play and obey.
[6:53] Okay. Yes, some of you laughing.
[6:57] All right. So, I want to get from the
[7:00] first one. Let's start with seven
[7:02] thunders are seven voices of seven men.
[7:05] That's number one. Are you still with
[7:08] me?
[7:10] &gt;&gt; So, this was one of the first doctrines
[7:11] of the message because of course the
[7:13] prophet dies. This is the first man-made
[7:16] development after the death of the
[7:18] prophet because
[7:20] uh you know the way it was with the
[7:22] prophet um and this was amazing. I know
[7:25] some of you don't realize this I because
[7:30] he died and sister Ma was the one who
[7:33] had to sign off on on his burial.
[7:38] Uh she was in a coma
[7:40] and they couldn't do anything. They had
[7:42] to keep the body. I think it was like an
[7:44] entire year or something until she came
[7:46] out of the co and to sign off they could
[7:49] not do anything. Can you imagine the
[7:50] mindset
[7:52] &gt;&gt; of the people at that time when he had
[7:54] just finished 1963 6465 talking about
[7:57] the seventh seal the coming of the lord
[7:58] the rapture taking place. He preached
[8:00] his last the rapture message in December
[8:03] before he dies and then he dies after he
[8:05] preaches communion. And now these people
[8:07] are left. There's no closure. They're
[8:09] not getting to bury him. They don't know
[8:11] what what are all the men that supported
[8:13] him for the 30 years of his ministry
[8:16] going to do?
[8:18] &gt;&gt; What do you think happened? Who's going
[8:21] to be the new leader? That's number one
[8:22] with humans, right? Who's going to take
[8:24] over from him? Can you imagine if there
[8:27] were people saying Elijah has died, he's
[8:29] gone, who's going to be the Elisha?
[8:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[8:32] &gt;&gt; we they already had Elijah's mantels in
[8:35] brother Maron's day. Yeah.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; So who were these men? They were the
[8:42] first friends of the prophet. They were
[8:47] people who were with him. There were
[8:49] people who some of them whom he ordained
[8:51] as ministers.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; And the first thing that happened is
[8:55] that this idea came across that he
[8:59] finished. He preached the seven seal and
[9:01] it's now time for the thunders. And his
[9:03] idea begin to form that the thunders
[9:05] were voices. And because he said uh in
[9:08] the days of the voice of the seventh
[9:10] angel when he shall begin to sound
[9:12] therefore the the thunders the voices of
[9:15] the thunders must be men as well.
[9:18] Now can you imagine from the group of I
[9:20] don't know how many 50s something or
[9:22] more men who's going to be the seven?
[9:26] And it's like people started accepting
[9:29] well I'm one one of them. I'm one of
[9:30] them. I'm one of them. Even if they
[9:33] didn't agree with themselves, they
[9:35] became the seven thunders or voices who
[9:38] had to go through the world and spread
[9:40] the gospel and they took upon themselves
[9:42] authority and and some people would
[9:44] follow someone and others would follow
[9:46] another and they didn't realize what
[9:48] they were doing. Is this
[9:51] unfamiliar to what happened after Acts
[9:53] chapter 2?
[9:56] &gt;&gt; We know Thomas went to India.
[9:59] They found the church of St. Thomas then
[10:01] India
[10:02] we know some went to Rome some went to
[10:05] Arabia some went they split up and they
[10:07] went everywhere
[10:09] right taking the word
[10:12] okay number two the church goes up in
[10:16] Revelations 3 and returns in Revelations
[10:18] 19 and everything in between is to
[10:20] Israel now this is a general doctrine
[10:24] that rises everywhere in the world and
[10:27] it doesn't need a leader it's a doctrine
[10:30] that rises up in in a a people and
[10:33] eventually develops people that agree
[10:36] with it and then they form a brotherhood
[10:37] and eventually forms a leader. It
[10:39] happens anywhere at any time. It like it
[10:42] it pops up like mushrooms,
[10:45] right? This doctrine is
[10:47] self-explanatory. It means exactly what
[10:49] it says because you got one quote or a
[10:51] few quotes where brother says uh the
[10:53] bride goes up after Revelations 3 and
[10:56] only returns in Revelations 19. Uh so
[10:59] therefore everything Revelation 4 5 6 7
[11:01] 8 10 everything in between is got to do
[11:05] with Israel and the Jews. Nothing to do
[11:07] with the church or the bride. Uh and of
[11:10] course the question is then why did
[11:11] brother Brandon preach Revelation 6 and
[11:14] Revelations 4 and 5? Why did he preach
[11:16] it to the bride? Why did he talk about
[11:19] joning his name? Why did he speak about
[11:21] the seven seals? Why did he preach about
[11:23] Revelations 10:7 showing himself? So
[11:25] these people literally believed brother
[11:27] Madam was wrong.
[11:30] Imagine
[11:32] taking what he said and saying he's
[11:34] right there but he's wrong about this
[11:35] and he's right about that. That's like
[11:38] people taking the word of a prophet
[11:41] picking what they want to be true and
[11:43] canceling out a whole group of his
[11:45] message and saying his false using him
[11:48] to prove him wrong.
[11:51] That's how ridiculous it is. But it
[11:53] happened and it's still happening. It's
[11:55] not a very popular belief in the message
[11:58] and it's mostly followed by uh those of
[12:00] a certain minister who believed he was
[12:04] the significant one to bring this answer
[12:07] to the rest of the message world and to
[12:09] take the message on further from the
[12:12] prophet. He believed he was and and he
[12:14] was probably one of the mo the major
[12:17] proponents of this thought which caused
[12:19] many people to kind of get caught up in
[12:21] it. But in this teaching they believe
[12:24] that revelations 10 has not yet
[12:26] happened. The mighty angel has. So can
[12:29] you see that if you just take that re he
[12:32] goes up in the church goes up in
[12:34] revelations 3 returns in 19. You cancel
[12:36] out the open book. You cannot preach it.
[12:41] You literally say revelations 10:7 is
[12:43] not brother.
[12:45] Am I right? That's what it does. And uh
[12:49] it was quite confusing for me that they
[12:51] used his own message to prove him wrong.
[12:53] Quoting his quotes from Daniel. They
[12:55] would literally say he was right in
[12:57] Daniel 70 weeks about 7 years left. He
[12:59] was wrong in the seals when he said 3
[13:01] and 1/2 years left.
[13:03] I mean you are standing here in 2020
[13:06] something looking back at what he
[13:08] preached in 1963 to 65 and 1950s and you
[13:13] are from here deciding where he was
[13:15] right and he was wrong.
[13:17] How does it even make sense? How is it
[13:20] even,
[13:22] you know, the right revelation?
[13:24] But yet, it is. Many people put their
[13:27] heart and soul behind it. There's a
[13:30] reason, right? So, these people also
[13:33] believe that there's a seven-year
[13:34] tribulation left after the rapture of
[13:37] the bride. Some believe it's before the
[13:40] rapture of the bride. uh um that the
[13:43] rapture, the coming of Christ is after
[13:45] the tribulation. Yes, we still get some
[13:48] of those. And um basically those people
[13:51] say when you ask them, but brother man
[13:54] was the forerunner. They say no, no, no,
[13:55] no, no, no. The quote says his message
[13:59] will forrunner.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; So it's fine that he died. His message
[14:02] is the forerunner.
[14:04] &gt;&gt; You see how you can use quotes to what
[14:07] would you have said in Christ's day?
[14:10] What did the followers of John the
[14:12] Baptist say when John died?
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Okay, next one. Seventh seal is not open
[14:22] and thunder is not revealed. Stay with
[14:24] the ABCs. This is probably one of the
[14:26] most common doctrines in the message.
[14:30] Um, and it again, it's a doctrine that
[14:32] is what it says, right? With quotes and
[14:35] scriptures to back you up. Also, this is
[14:37] a doctrine that rises everywhere.
[14:41] And why does it rise? In resistance to
[14:44] others,
[14:46] right? And this doctrine has no
[14:49] leadership because you can just
[14:51] basically preach. You can come here and
[14:52] take out perseverance and preach
[14:54] perseverance. You can come out here and
[14:56] preach uh life story. You can come out
[14:59] here and preach who, why, who is this?
[15:03] uh when their eyes are open, you just
[15:04] come out and pull out a message book and
[15:06] preach from it. Read some poems, read
[15:08] some scriptures, preach from it. You
[15:09] don't have to teach anything. Why?
[15:11] Because that's the safest thing to do.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; You just take the message and you say
[15:15] what he says, right? Basically, these
[15:18] people resist any suggestion that the
[15:22] second coming of the Lord, the rapture
[15:24] and resurrection are taking place. You
[15:27] cannot talk to them about it because
[15:29] they believe what brother said that the
[15:31] seventh seal was not fully revealed. So
[15:34] nobody has the authority to say that and
[15:36] if you do say it you become like a a
[15:39] heretic.
[15:41] They do not accept that revelations 10
[15:43] 1-4 is the past. They do not see
[15:47] Revelations 10:4 occurring already that
[15:50] the mighty angel has descended with the
[15:51] book in his hand. They do not accept it.
[15:54] But they accept that revelations 10:7
[15:56] has happened. That's what boggles me.
[15:59] They're not like the other group that
[16:00] say that brother Brandham is not 107.
[16:03] They say he is 107 but 10 1-4 has not
[16:06] happened.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[16:09] &gt;&gt; they deny that brother Brandham is the
[16:11] forerunner. They believe the message is
[16:13] the forerunner because you have to take
[16:15] that claim because if you say if you
[16:18] take the quote where he says the
[16:19] forerunner is on earth at the time of
[16:21] this coming that makes a problem for
[16:24] their doctrine. So they deny that it
[16:27] cannot be him as the forerunner. It's
[16:29] his message that is the forerunner.
[16:32] What are you doing? You're trying to
[16:34] have faith with your grace elves.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; That's what's going on.
[16:38] So they do believe we should pre they
[16:40] they they do believe we should preach uh
[16:43] or rather we should not preach any deep
[16:45] doctrines because they believe you don't
[16:48] have to preach the seven seals brother
[16:50] there's no need for you brother preached
[16:52] it you don't have to talk about the
[16:54] trumpets we read feast of the trumpets
[16:57] there's no reason for pastors to go any
[16:59] deeper or reexplain revelations brother
[17:02] Benham has already done that sound good
[17:05] sounds safe it sounds excellent Because
[17:07] they'll even tell you all the brothers
[17:09] who try to do it messed everything up so
[17:12] it's safer not to do it.
[17:15] What is this fear?
[17:17] This is the same as don't cross the
[17:20] Jordan. We can't do it.
[17:25] which is and then all you have to do is
[17:27] look at what happens to the churches
[17:30] because whatever your faith is is going
[17:33] to be proved by the fruits
[17:36] and that's what you got to watch right
[17:39] so they deny that he's the forerunner
[17:42] and they don't want you to touch any
[17:44] doctrines I literally heard a minister
[17:46] say we there's no reason to preach the
[17:48] trumpets because it's to the Jews
[17:52] and you think about yeah trumpets are to
[17:54] the Jews
[17:55] But it's in the Bible.
[17:57] But no, you don't need to touch it. You
[17:59] don't need to to speak about Revelations
[18:01] 12, Revelations 14, Revelations 8 and 9.
[18:05] You don't have to touch it because it's
[18:06] got nothing to do with the bride and the
[18:08] church. And that's to that's to Israel.
[18:10] And the and the two witnesses are going
[18:12] to come and they're going to reveal
[18:14] those chapters to Israel. You don't even
[18:15] have to look at it.
[18:18] I mean, look at what we've been through
[18:19] with the entire book of Revelations
[18:21] and how blessed that was to us. Yes,
[18:24] sir.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Whether we went through it to even know
[18:26] what Israel really is about and their
[18:28] struggles and what trumpets really mean
[18:30] to us,
[18:32] &gt;&gt; the idea uh that brother Baram has
[18:35] already explained it and it doesn't need
[18:37] to be reexplained. It's very attractive.
[18:40] It's safe. Right? Uh and then the idea
[18:44] is that those who preach deep doctrines
[18:47] and add they add things to what brother
[18:49] Benham said and they confuse everyone.
[18:52] So it's best to stay with the ABCs and
[18:54] the cood.
[18:56] And this is the trap. They actually
[18:58] think they stay with what brother Baron
[19:00] said.
[19:04] News flash, nobody does.
[19:09] Everybody thinks they do.
[19:12] Yes, even you.
[19:14] There's no way you can stay with what
[19:16] brother Baron says 100% in 2025.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Because brother Baron preached in the
[19:22] 1960s lost.
[19:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:26] &gt;&gt; So you're basically convincing yourself
[19:28] that you are and even if you come here
[19:31] and repeat what brother Barham said and
[19:34] you and and how do you preach? You might
[19:37] as well just preach by reading what he
[19:38] says. Because the moment you say
[19:40] something, you already are interpreting.
[19:43] The moment you say, "Do you see what he
[19:46] said?" You can tie this up. Why are you
[19:48] doing that? Who asked you to tie up
[19:50] anything that he said with something
[19:51] else?
[19:52] &gt;&gt; No.
[19:52] &gt;&gt; That means you're adding.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; There's every single brother I know who
[19:56] told me I'm adding, I tell him, you're
[19:59] adding, too. No, I'm not. Yes, you are.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. You have no choice. As long as you
[20:04] have gray cells in this box of yours and
[20:06] you read a quote and then you tell me
[20:08] what it means, you just interpret it.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; True.
[20:14] &gt;&gt; So this is why it's hypocritical, right?
[20:17] The next one is seven thunders are the
[20:19] virtues. The seven virtues. So this
[20:21] straight off the bat started in New York
[20:24] City in the in the USA. They preached
[20:27] that the seven thunders are the seven
[20:29] voices of the seven church ages which
[20:32] are seven manifestations of the Holy
[20:35] Spirit into the church. It was a
[20:37] phenomenal doctrine. They taught that
[20:40] each virtue, faith, virtue, knowledge,
[20:42] temperance, patience, godliness,
[20:43] brotherly kindness was an individual
[20:46] lived voice of the Holy Spirit.
[20:50] Basically, the prophet preaching the
[20:52] seven seals would restore all those
[20:55] seven lived voices to the last church,
[20:59] giving her the character to wait for
[21:02] charity, the capstone to descend. Some
[21:04] of you thinking, "Yes,
[21:08] that sounds right." Amen.
[21:11] The Holy Ghost, they said, was the
[21:13] dynamics. They fitted it in with how the
[21:15] prophet preached. The Holy Ghost is the
[21:17] dynamics that seals it all together,
[21:19] puts the dynamics into the church,
[21:22] brings all the mechanics to life, and
[21:24] charity descends on everything to make
[21:26] it perfect. I mean, who can find fault
[21:28] with that? Sounds fantastic.
[21:32] However, they preached, "We are not yet
[21:34] in the capstone age. We're still in
[21:36] Leodysia." Some of them preached, some
[21:39] of them didn't. And we're still waiting
[21:41] for the corporal coming of the Lord to
[21:44] bring the capstone. But before that
[21:46] happens, seven thunders have to give
[21:48] rapturing faith. Was a major thing. How
[21:51] does it give rapturing faith? Doesn't
[21:52] matter. Just believe it.
[21:55] Right?
[21:56] This doctrine again like every other
[21:59] doctrine leads to elevating human
[22:02] leadership.
[22:04] Somebody has to be the big boss and
[22:06] under that other big bosses. And then
[22:08] when it spreads to another continent,
[22:10] there's got to be a big boss on that
[22:11] continent. And then if you go to that
[22:14] city, there's going to be a big boss of
[22:15] that in that city. And wherever you go,
[22:18] why did they have to have this human
[22:20] leadership, this exuberant
[22:24] human leadership that took control over
[22:26] people
[22:28] if this was something freely given to
[22:30] the church?
[22:33] And then they have to basically go to
[22:36] conventions from all over South Africa,
[22:38] all over Africa. If the main guy was
[22:40] coming, everyone had to be there. If the
[22:44] second in charge was coming, everyone
[22:45] had to be there. They had to be there.
[22:47] They would sell their cars to be there.
[22:51] They would sell stuff from their homes
[22:53] to be there.
[22:58] I was there sometimes.
[23:01] I I saw all this happen. So, I'm telling
[23:04] you, people will get stuck between
[23:06] Derban and Johannesburg and make a phone
[23:08] call. Their brothers will drive from
[23:10] Johannesburg to come and pick these
[23:12] people up overnight and be there at the
[23:14] meeting the next morning.
[23:17] Back when cars were rickety and
[23:20] &gt;&gt; broken down and no electronics and man,
[23:25] you'd be you'd be lugging like buckets
[23:28] of fuel and hose pipes and there'll be a
[23:31] mechanic driving with you in case your
[23:32] car breaks down. There was no freeways.
[23:36] You had to go through back roads and
[23:38] potholes and it was incredible. And
[23:41] these people made it
[23:44] &gt;&gt; with children, with babies. Some of you
[23:47] can't even sit here with an infant for 2
[23:49] hours.
[23:51] These people would go with babies in the
[23:53] back of a of a van.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[23:56] &gt;&gt; For 8 hours. Some would travel by train
[23:59] just to be there.
[24:03] Okay. Which brings us to the return
[24:05] ministry or the returned ministry,
[24:08] whichever way. I don't know exactly who
[24:11] started this. Uh maybe if we interviewed
[24:14] some of the people from North America,
[24:15] we might be able to. But it seems to me
[24:17] something that that gathered traction
[24:20] because brothers were talking about,
[24:23] right? From what I've heard from
[24:25] speaking to brothers that came out of
[24:27] there. That's kind of like they can name
[24:29] you some names which we're not
[24:30] interested in, but basically it gathered
[24:33] traction. Didn't have like a singular
[24:36] leader who who took control of this of
[24:39] this whole thing. Or maybe it kind of
[24:41] developed that way. But it has to
[24:43] basically do with the fulfilling of the
[24:45] tent vision that brother speaks about
[24:48] the big tent with a big crowd. You
[24:50] remember that? And a little room and and
[24:52] all of that. And uh and so I also heard
[24:56] that there are some believers that were
[24:58] holding an actual aeroplane
[25:02] for brother Madam when he returns, when
[25:06] he's resurrected. He's going to use that
[25:08] plane. And they are keeping it for him
[25:09] to fly around the world and and make
[25:11] this great sweep because he got 40 days.
[25:15] In 40 days he has to man this sounds
[25:17] like around the world in 40 days.
[25:21] And it bugged me. I remember being a kid
[25:23] saying why does he need a plane? If he
[25:26] resurrected he can travel by thought.
[25:31] So this should have been this should
[25:33] have been cut off from a start but it
[25:35] seemed at the time of its arrival many
[25:38] good ministers
[25:40] didn't and couldn't refute it. A lot of
[25:43] people had an issue with the prophet's
[25:44] family because they also didn't come out
[25:47] and say no this is not what brother man
[25:50] said. Like, and I don't blame any one of
[25:53] them because you're in that time. You
[25:56] just came out from this amazing ministry
[25:59] and there's these people kind of looking
[26:01] in and reading and telling you he's
[26:03] coming back. What do you say? Who are
[26:05] you to say no, it can't be? You're going
[26:08] to stand in the face of some of these
[26:10] great anointed men and tell them they're
[26:11] wrong. Most of the people say like, just
[26:14] hold on, you know, let's not say
[26:16] anything. Let's wait. Let's wait. Let's
[26:17] wait. But this thing began to grow and
[26:20] took over churches.
[26:22] And most of these very fine people who
[26:25] followed this did not know this doctrine
[26:27] originated in the ancient Catholic
[26:29] church
[26:32] that taught that the world would be uh
[26:34] sorry I'm actually I put this piece here
[26:38] in it's actually from the previous uh um
[26:42] from the 77 virtues.
[26:45] uh the people and just just to to back
[26:48] up there the seven thunder seven virtues
[26:51] is actually a Catholic doctrine and
[26:54] those who started it back there in the
[26:56] 70s did not even know this in the
[26:59] Catholic doctrine they have this you can
[27:01] read it it's really phenomenal Catholics
[27:03] they do some great things they came up
[27:06] with this whole idea about the seven
[27:08] deadly sins
[27:10] and these sins would take over mankind
[27:12] and would infiltrate all of public and
[27:16] they they had these seven virtues. Now
[27:19] you know the way it goes the Catholics
[27:22] came from Grecian mythology and Roman
[27:24] mythology. They were Roman Catholics. So
[27:27] they they remember Aristotle and
[27:29] Socrates the four virtues. Have you
[27:31] heard of them? Aris come on people must
[27:34] read
[27:36] Aristotle and Socrates four uh um like
[27:39] ideological
[27:41] cardinal the cardinal uh virtues and
[27:44] they would they would paint these
[27:46] virtues like women they were like women
[27:49] who were angels or angels were women I
[27:51] don't know and then they had from the
[27:54] four cardinal virtues they developed the
[27:56] three theological virtues so before
[27:59] Roman Catholicism even came in there was
[28:01] this seven virtues
[28:04] &gt;&gt; that came from ancient Greece. So they
[28:07] adopted it into Roman Catholicism and
[28:10] they adopted uh Hebrew tradition into it
[28:13] and they came up with this idea that the
[28:15] seven archangels
[28:18] would carry the seven virtues to the
[28:21] people to cleanse the public of the
[28:23] seven deadly sins at or just before the
[28:27] advent of Christ or when Christ comes.
[28:30] the seven virtues will be brought and
[28:32] the voices of the angels would be the
[28:34] seven thunders.
[28:36] &gt;&gt; That's a Catholic doctrine
[28:39] and the people from the seven virtues,
[28:42] seven thunders, seven virtues did not
[28:43] even realize that. Okay. Now, so these
[28:46] virtues go back to the ancient Greek
[28:48] teachings and uh so it's probably good
[28:51] to look into that if ever you you go and
[28:53] research it. So coming back to this
[28:56] return ministry, it became something and
[28:58] I think I I may have mentioned it to you
[29:01] the last time you were here. When I was
[29:03] in the United States in 1995,
[29:06] the churches in the United States were
[29:08] still struggling with the return
[29:09] ministry
[29:11] because wherever we went, they were not
[29:13] able to interpret the tent vision.
[29:17] They were being sort of hammered by
[29:21] people who were using the 10 vision to
[29:23] say that the prophet was coming back and
[29:26] the ministers at the time did not know
[29:28] how to refute that. And so they they
[29:31] couldn't even tie the 10 vision in with
[29:33] the third bull ministry. They were
[29:34] missing quotes for brother Ram speaking
[29:36] about what the third pool really is.
[29:38] They were holding on to the third bull
[29:40] being greater miracles and signs than
[29:44] discernment and healing.
[29:47] They were relating the third pool to
[29:49] Hatty, right? And so on the word
[29:51] speaking things into existence. So to
[29:54] them the evolution from the of the three
[29:56] pools was the miracles had to be greater
[30:00] and the greatest would be instead of
[30:02] praying and laying on of hands or
[30:03] discerning would be spoken word speaking
[30:06] things into existence. Hat right
[30:08] squirrels. They got plenty
[30:12] plenty to say that this is going to
[30:14] happen. And then they believe that
[30:16] because the prophet made some prophecies
[30:19] that never came true because he's a true
[30:22] prophet. He cannot be false. Therefore,
[30:25] he has to come back to fulfill it.
[30:29] Hey, sounds reasonable.
[30:32] I mean, if you're you're a person who
[30:33] has a little bit of brain with
[30:35] mathematics in it, you say a + b equals
[30:38] this, you know, 1 plus 1 equals 2. Well,
[30:40] of course, if he's a true prophet,
[30:44] Amen. And he made some prophecies and it
[30:47] never was fulfilled. For us to get the
[30:49] answer, he has to come back.
[30:52] Logical. It's mathematical, right? Okay.
[30:55] Which brings us to Peru.
[30:58] this fancy weird sounding Greek word
[31:03] peruia peria whatever you want to say
[31:06] the word basically means presence right
[31:10] and in the original Greek it's in the in
[31:12] the Bible wherever you see in your Bible
[31:14] the word coming or presence you go into
[31:18] that in the original Greek and you it's
[31:20] going to come out with this word perua
[31:22] and most people whenever I start saying
[31:25] Peru or anyone starts talking about
[31:27] peruia
[31:28] your prefrontal context uh uh cortex
[31:32] starts drying up. You start going
[31:37] cuz it's already too much for the human
[31:39] brain to handle. We start talking about
[31:42] peruia and epiphania and you like you
[31:46] start going crossey like what do we do
[31:48] with this? Right? And so there are also
[31:53] other Greek words used to in in in the
[31:57] context that they preach about and it's
[31:59] basically about the coming of the Lord
[32:01] and that's where the word Peruia is. Let
[32:03] me show it to you. I think it's in the
[32:05] in the slides brother. If you can just
[32:07] pull up there it is. That's the word P R
[32:09] O U S I A. Peruseia. There's the
[32:12] pronunciation. Basically means presence.
[32:14] And you can see the commentaries uh the
[32:16] coming arrival, advent, the future,
[32:18] visible return. So here is whoever wrote
[32:22] the comments in is saying it's the
[32:24] future return. But that's not how this
[32:26] was used, right? So again, this this
[32:31] came from a very intellectual class of
[32:34] people.
[32:36] &gt;&gt; People who studied Greek and Hebrew, it
[32:39] came from a very intellectual place. And
[32:42] I'm not too clear on all the intricacies
[32:45] or how the doctrine evolved and how it
[32:48] became so strong over three decades. But
[32:51] basically it was it was this doctrine
[32:55] did not deny the seventh seal. It did
[32:58] not deny February 28, 1963 the cloud. It
[33:02] was basically saying when it started
[33:04] that the opening of the seventh seal in
[33:06] the cloud can be identified as the
[33:08] peruia or the personal presence of God.
[33:12] But we are still waiting for the
[33:14] corporal return. Right? And there would
[33:17] be this fight then that would ensue
[33:19] about what is coming and what is
[33:21] appearing and so on. So um they're
[33:25] basically saying yes he has come but
[33:28] he's here in his supernatural form. He's
[33:31] not visible to us but he's felt among
[33:33] us. And it was claiming that the prophet
[33:36] foreran the peruer of Christ and that it
[33:40] has been fulfilled. So can you see what
[33:42] they do? They put the quotes together.
[33:44] They say no of course he was the
[33:46] forerunner. He wasn't wrong about that.
[33:47] They disagree with the others who say
[33:49] his message for ran. Then they would say
[33:51] he definitely fored and it took place
[33:53] because he for the Peruia.
[33:56] Are you thoroughly confused?
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Oh good.
[34:02] So
[34:04] some who I've even I I don't understand
[34:07] a lot of it and some who I have spoken
[34:10] to believe that there is no need for the
[34:12] literal corporal coming anymore and that
[34:14] the so with this he is here he's come uh
[34:17] there's no need to take communion
[34:19] anymore there's no need to do anything
[34:20] else anymore he is here it's all over
[34:22] we're just waiting for the translation
[34:25] and uh there's no need for a corporal
[34:27] coming anymore and the next time he will
[34:28] come is to the Jews used and then even
[34:31] among this Peruia group they started
[34:33] having conflicts about those things and
[34:36] they relied very heavily on the
[34:38] difference between the words appearing
[34:40] and coming. You don't have to try to
[34:42] furiously write all this down. You're
[34:44] getting my notes so you can read it all
[34:46] over again. Right? The problem with this
[34:49] doctrine
[34:50] uh you know the people that followed it
[34:53] because once you bring something so
[34:55] intellectual
[34:57] uh and and the people are obsessed with
[34:59] the intellectualism and the teaching
[35:01] they start to go quiet and dead and then
[35:05] the leaders realize everyone is you know
[35:08] like lying on a slab in a morg with
[35:10] coldness and bluish tinge setting into
[35:13] them
[35:14] and then they you come from an
[35:16] intellectual place now you're going
[35:17] going to try and cause some revival and
[35:21] you're just not built for that. So the
[35:23] only way is to reintroduce gifts of the
[35:26] Holy Ghost like dreams, prophecies,
[35:28] visions and you know get the people
[35:30] worked up with with things like that and
[35:32] that's what they did. So you had this
[35:34] intellectual Peruia doctrine but also
[35:37] everybody having dreams, visions and and
[35:39] so on and prophecies.
[35:41] When that happens, prophecies are going
[35:44] to come in that do not align with the
[35:46] word.
[35:47] And prophecies are even going to come in
[35:49] that's going to
[35:52] not support exactly what the person who
[35:55] started the doctrine said.
[35:58] Always happens. So the problem with this
[36:01] doctrine was it became very hard for the
[36:04] simple public of the message to
[36:06] understand. It favored only those who
[36:09] spoke good English. I mean how do you
[36:11] how do you teach Peruia to Zulu person?
[36:15] How do you teach epiphania to a Zulu
[36:17] person to a Pa person to someone from
[36:20] South Africa? How do you teach uh um
[36:23] erami to a Chinese person or a person
[36:26] from from where my ancestors come from
[36:29] in India?
[36:32] Where do you get the ability to show
[36:35] them this? Unless there's an actual
[36:37] discrepancy, you're going to have to
[36:38] break this thing down to the finest
[36:40] detail and show them. but basically
[36:43] caught
[36:45] right
[36:47] and uh so this belief was very uh here's
[36:50] the other thing like the thunders were a
[36:53] Catholic doctrine thunder's virtues the
[36:56] peruia was a Jehovah's witness doctrine
[36:59] &gt;&gt; started in 1914 by Rutherford the leader
[37:02] of the Jehovah's witness who spoke that
[37:05] the personal presence use those words of
[37:07] Christ is already here and he had issu
[37:09] he had like um ideas about the 144,000
[37:13] and those who were going to get in like
[37:14] the coming of the Lord has already taken
[37:16] place. Okay. So from this Peruia
[37:19] doctrine there was an offshoot that came
[37:22] and hit the world uh for a for a few
[37:25] years. It hit Durban quite bad. Hit
[37:28] South Africa a little bit too in
[37:30] different places. Cape Town,
[37:31] Johannesburg, two lords. It was an
[37:34] offshoot of the Perua group.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Okay. and uh uh it already originated
[37:40] before the message. Another thing, two
[37:43] lords doctrine originate. I don't have
[37:45] the time to go to show it to you, but
[37:47] you can go Google it. You'll find two
[37:49] lords long before the message people
[37:51] came up with. Okay, it comes from David.
[37:55] The Lord said unto my Lord, sit down in
[37:58] my right hand until I make thy thy
[38:00] enemies thy foottool. So there so but
[38:03] this is important because brother Bham
[38:05] uses this this one quote where he said
[38:08] it Jesus it was Jesus in Jesus because
[38:11] Jesus came in the name of his father.
[38:15] So what they were saying was the name of
[38:17] the father is Jesus and the name of the
[38:20] son is Jesus.
[38:22] Now watch what this is about. It's about
[38:23] explaining the seventh seal. So, it's
[38:26] also they don't deny February 28, 1963,
[38:28] but they're saying the cloud that came
[38:30] was Jesus the father
[38:32] &gt;&gt; and we're still waiting for Jesus the
[38:34] son.
[38:36] What is this about people? It's about
[38:38] trying to explain the seventh seal.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[38:42] &gt;&gt; that's what they're going at. So, it
[38:45] struggled, this doctrine hit Durban
[38:47] quite bad, but it struggled to make an
[38:49] impression on the majority of the
[38:51] believers. uh and uh basically it
[38:54] grabbed those who already didn't have a
[38:57] good grasp of the seventh seal and uh
[39:00] but it didn't achieve the success that
[39:02] they thought it would achieve. They
[39:04] tried to rebaptize people. They try to
[39:07] make apostles of this thing and pastors
[39:09] had to be reappointed by the apostle and
[39:12] oh it's crazy. Okay, so the next one is
[39:16] this might sound very familiar to you.
[39:19] The Lord came in 1963. We are in the
[39:22] millennium already. So some of you
[39:24] think, "Yeah, but the Lord came in
[39:25] 1963." Yeah, but the millennium now,
[39:29] right? There are quotes for these
[39:32] things. There are reasons why people
[39:34] choose this. So this doctrine came
[39:36] became one that flourished mostly in the
[39:38] eastern hemisphere of the world. Uh it
[39:40] is once again based on the seventh seal
[39:42] because people began to preach the
[39:46] coming of the Lord February 28, 1963. He
[39:49] has come. If he came in 1953
[39:53] and then you put the other ones, he
[39:54] comes with a sharp voice and trump it
[39:56] means the rapture is over. The rapture
[39:59] is over. We've been through some years
[40:02] of tribulation. We've, you know,
[40:04] Armageddon can be tied to almost
[40:06] anything. And then we are definitely
[40:09] here in a millennium now, right? That's
[40:12] what happened. And they worked it out
[40:14] with numerous quotes and dates and
[40:16] numbers. And it was a doctrine that
[40:18] excited a lot of people who were
[40:20] struggling at the time to make sense
[40:22] from all the different ministries that
[40:24] were trying to explain the seven seal.
[40:26] And u but this doctrine again could not
[40:28] sustain because it became harder. How do
[40:31] you try to prove to people that you're
[40:32] in the millennium when you're getting
[40:34] sick with the flu and you're getting
[40:37] hospitalized and you're getting cancer
[40:38] and you're and the so to relate this
[40:42] doctrine with reality became a problem.
[40:45] So while people would have it in their
[40:46] heads the reality of it was a problem to
[40:49] them. I could see some of you looking at
[40:51] me thinking we never even heard this
[40:54] before.
[40:55] Right? Okay. The bride coming. This one
[40:59] shocked me because I didn't even know
[41:01] this was seen of as a movement. I just
[41:04] thought there were brothers who are
[41:06] there's a quote, the bride coming of
[41:08] Christ and and I know this quote. I've
[41:10] read it to you before. But you know, uh
[41:13] I didn't realize that there may have
[41:15] been ministers who took it and made it a
[41:17] thing.
[41:19] Some of you might be thinking, "Hey,
[41:21] brother Albert, we make it a thing." you
[41:23] know,
[41:25] so this is yet another based on the
[41:28] seventh seal, the bride coming of
[41:31] Christ. So something I hadn't realized
[41:34] uh that had become a doctrine until it
[41:36] was pointed out to me. I had to I was
[41:38] directed to some statements on the
[41:40] internet where I had to go look at it
[41:41] and see that hey there's people that
[41:43] recognize this in North America as a com
[41:45] as a as a movement. Okay. So, and
[41:50] because of what it sounds like, I can
[41:52] only think that it means it refers to
[41:54] the word being manifested in his people,
[41:58] which is you something you and I would
[41:59] say amen to.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; The word becoming manifested his people,
[42:03] the bride becoming Christ, Christ
[42:05] becoming the bride. It sounds great.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Except, are we a movement
[42:12] &gt;&gt; or a part of a movement?
[42:14] &gt;&gt; We didn't even know there was a
[42:15] movement.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Maybe there is. I don't know.
[42:19] So in that case we we may find ourselves
[42:21] aligning with these people who are
[42:23] preaching this and saying that you know
[42:25] uh but it it must be mostly true uh for
[42:29] this time and it's very in line with
[42:30] revelations 10 and the mighty angel
[42:32] descending yet because I don't know if
[42:35] there is a movement and not knowing all
[42:36] that is said by this movement I couldn't
[42:39] say we subscribe to it right you
[42:43] wouldn't really know whether you unless
[42:45] you speak to the people who are part of
[42:47] the movement
[42:49] And uh so anyway, my position is I don't
[42:52] like to be limited by any name.
[42:56] Period.
[42:58] I I like to be free. I don't like to be
[43:01] labeled as some I don't like labels.
[43:03] Okay? I I want to be able to change my
[43:05] mind tomorrow.
[43:07] If God's going to change it for me,
[43:10] &gt;&gt; I like that. I like the fact that he can
[43:12] tell me tomorrow you were wrong about
[43:14] this, you need to change that. I don't
[43:16] like being limited to a movement and
[43:18] being associated with people of a
[43:20] movement. It's it's too restricted.
[43:23] Okay? It's a cage. Which then leads us
[43:25] to the one you all were laughing at.
[43:27] Press play and obey.
[43:30] I honestly here's this one. I only
[43:33] discovered last month
[43:36] uh and become acquainted with because I
[43:38] didn't even know this was a thing. How
[43:40] many of you have heard of this?
[43:43] Yeah. First play. Wow. so few press play
[43:47] and obey probably because you know
[43:48] people or or whatever I I I don't know
[43:51] and it was mentioned to me on WhatsApp
[43:53] by another believer and when they they
[43:55] they wrote it on WhatsApp I had no idea
[43:57] what they were talking about and they
[43:59] were they were mentioned it like I
[44:01] should know and I and I didn't know and
[44:03] then I realized after it was explained
[44:05] to me that this is uh message people who
[44:08] are now staying home and listening to
[44:11] the prophet's tapes no longer tapes But
[44:15] they're and I believe they told me it's
[44:17] got a symbol of a triangle which means
[44:20] play like the play button.
[44:23] So they have a symbol. So press play and
[44:27] obey comes with this the that way for
[44:30] you. It's black triangle which means
[44:32] press play. I don't know. This is what
[44:36] I've been told. of all things of all
[44:39] that we that we heard you know seven
[44:41] thunders and virtues perusia this that
[44:44] this is actually a doctrine.
[44:47] Do you know why? Do you know what a
[44:49] doctrine actually is? A doctrine is
[44:51] something taught that can be applied
[44:54] like how do you apply Peruia?
[44:57] How do you apply seven thunder seven
[44:59] virtues? How do you apply anything? This
[45:02] is something that can actually be
[45:04] applied. You can literally press press
[45:07] play and obey. You can literally stay
[45:10] home, press play on the tape or CD and
[45:12] stay home and and listen to what it
[45:14] said. You say you obey. I don't believe
[45:16] you. But you know, whatever. Um
[45:20] I know humans are just disbelieving and
[45:23] they don't u they don't disobedient.
[45:26] Sorry. Very disobedient. You by nature
[45:28] are disobedient. So tell me you press
[45:30] play and and obey. Uh come on.
[45:34] So of all things right it's not only a
[45:37] teaching it it's not just an action that
[45:40] people do it's actually a teaching
[45:44] it's being taught to them right and it's
[45:46] manifested in many conflicting ways it's
[45:49] and it's the same this is amazing thing
[45:51] it's the same all around the world I got
[45:53] to really know about this in my last
[45:54] trip and uh I do not know for myself how
[45:58] exactly it is run all I have is hearsay
[46:01] so I heard day that there is an audio of
[46:04] the prophet played at specific times and
[46:08] everywhere in the world. If that time is
[46:10] 3:00 in the morning where you are, you
[46:12] wake up and play it there.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; And if it's 10:00 in the night at at
[46:17] another place in the world, you play it
[46:20] there. So your church service is
[46:22] wherever it is played from its head
[46:23] office. That's what I've heard. How true
[46:26] it is, I don't know. But it sounds to me
[46:28] like the people who are doing this are
[46:30] very committed.
[46:32] And by itself, it sounds amazing. I
[46:35] mean, can you imagine if we could get
[46:37] people to tune in at all types of and
[46:40] and tell them, "Tune in. This is the
[46:42] time we're now speaking." And people
[46:44] from all over the world are tuning in at
[46:46] that time. That would be amazing. I
[46:47] mean, it on its own, it sounds amazing
[46:49] that there are believers who are so
[46:51] committed. They'll wake up at 3 in the
[46:53] morning to listen to a message of the
[46:54] prophet.
[46:57] We used to do that some time ago when we
[47:00] were young in the message. And so it
[47:03] sounds amazing. The problem with this
[47:05] practice is it is not scriptural
[47:08] &gt;&gt; and it will not last the test of time.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; It's it it works for people who have no
[47:15] children
[47:16] and people who have very small children.
[47:20] And then it doesn't work for people with
[47:22] teenagers
[47:24] because teenagers and and young children
[47:27] need a church.
[47:30] Home is not your church.
[47:33] You can't. So we've already seen this
[47:35] because I'm talking about 30 years ago,
[47:38] we already had people who disagreed with
[47:40] all the ministers and said, "We'll stay
[47:42] at home and listen to tapes because
[47:44] we're following the prophet." Every one
[47:45] of them lost their children.
[47:48] And today some of them lost their
[47:50] spouses. When I say lost, I don't mean
[47:51] they died. I mean they left.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; And when they leave they become worse
[47:56] than sinners.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; That's what I mean. So this idea of
[48:00] staying home and listen to the tapes.
[48:02] It's an illusion.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; That works for a while. I'm telling you
[48:07] again, they've restarted it. It already
[48:10] happened. We've already seen the effects
[48:12] of it.
[48:15] And yet there are good people. Right?
[48:18] The problem with this practice is it
[48:20] does not stand the test of time. It is a
[48:22] reaction. What it is is a reaction to a
[48:25] culture that many people in the message
[48:27] have disagreed with. And it's a rehash
[48:30] of something that started and failed a
[48:32] long time ago. its followers
[48:35] uh u will have quotes of the prophet to
[48:38] back up its leader as a prophet a store
[48:41] of food for the famine that is coming
[48:43] and on and on and on I I hear it
[48:45] non-stop however the reality of having a
[48:49] group of people
[48:51] are you listening whenever you get a
[48:53] group of people together remember we
[48:55] read this quote on on Wednesday which
[48:57] kind of shocked me where the prophet
[48:59] says as population increase Satan has
[49:02] more range to working.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; That's what happens. The more you have
[49:06] mass people to yourself, the enemy is
[49:08] going to get in.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the enemy is going to come
[49:12] in. Who's our leader? Who's going to be
[49:14] the deacon? Who's going to be this one?
[49:16] Who's going to speak for him when he's
[49:17] not here? Who's going to do this? Who's
[49:19] going to And the next thing you know,
[49:20] you've got factions all over again.
[49:23] Fights, splits, disagreements.
[49:26] It's just human. It's right. It's
[49:28] organization.
[49:30] The reality of having a group of people
[49:32] is at is that the enemy is right at your
[49:35] heels. Human leadership, are you
[49:37] listening?
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Every gathering of people starts with
[49:41] this problem. Human leadership.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; If you ever get a group of people
[49:45] together and you have an ideology, you
[49:49] have a doctrine, you have a certain
[49:51] belief, the first effect is human
[49:53] leadership. Who is going to be our
[49:55] leader? And every it doesn't matter if
[49:57] it's if if it's you people he's sitting
[49:59] here if you don't have the open book you
[50:02] are going to immediately say okay fine
[50:05] we got a church who is our leader now
[50:09] immediately look at what happens with
[50:11] all the churches when a pastor dies
[50:13] where the minister leaves or something
[50:16] what's the issue who's the leader
[50:17] there's no nobody's standing up saying
[50:20] uh excuse me the Holy Spirit is our
[50:23] leader
[50:25] or Let's follow the word. No. Which man?
[50:31] &gt;&gt; It's always the case. Which man is going
[50:33] to lead us? Who's going to call the
[50:34] shots? Secretly, it's where's the money
[50:37] going to?
[50:40] Amen.
[50:42] That's what it's all about. It's always
[50:44] about the money. Don't let them fool
[50:46] you. Okay. So the reality of this group
[50:51] is
[50:53] human leadership is the first trap.
[50:55] Individual revelation is going to stifle
[50:58] it because of the illusion that everyone
[51:01] So if you say just play the tapes, press
[51:05] play and obey. Everyone's just going to
[51:07] listen to the prophet and no one's going
[51:09] to have individual revelation.
[51:12] Yeah, of course. Somebody listening in
[51:15] China or Australia or South America or
[51:18] wherever, they're going to be listening
[51:20] to it, interpreting it in their own
[51:22] language or something and they're all
[51:25] reading the same quote at the same time
[51:27] and getting an individual revelation and
[51:30] then what happens when they come
[51:32] together and they start fellowshipping
[51:34] immediately there's disagreements.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; So, it's an illusion that they're all
[51:39] seeing. They all just press play and
[51:40] obey. It's an illusion because as long
[51:43] as you're listening to words and you are
[51:45] interpreting it, you are seeing
[51:46] individual revelation.
[51:49] Uh youth do not last under this movement
[51:53] there. It's never going to work. We've
[51:55] already seen the tests of staying home
[51:57] and playing tapes. Families break up. a
[52:01] living becomes liberal because with the
[52:03] with the tape comes the television,
[52:06] comes the movies, comes the internet.
[52:09] Not that it's not happening with others,
[52:11] it's there. Uh the dressing changes, the
[52:16] uh lack of Holy Spirit anointing. If you
[52:19] have church at home, it won't be long
[52:21] you'll be listening to the message in
[52:22] your bathrobe.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Because nobody's there. Yeah.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And then just think about this that you
[52:29] don't take the time, sisters, to do up
[52:32] your hair and be neat to come into the
[52:34] presence of the Lord. Just the fact that
[52:36] you can have church in your lounge when
[52:38] nobody's seeing you and you can just sit
[52:40] there like a slob listening to God's
[52:42] word,
[52:44] brother.
[52:47] Sitting there with your with your
[52:49] pajamas on and your your holy socks.
[52:52] I mean, they have holes in them,
[52:55] right? And you're sitting there, you're
[52:57] listening to the message, and you
[52:59] already have a bodily and spirit and
[53:03] mental idea that you can be just lazy
[53:06] and lacadasical in the presence of the
[53:08] Lord. You don't realize over time you
[53:10] are going to develop that behavior.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; Simply because you are not gathering
[53:16] under the anointing.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; We've we've seen this already. It's been
[53:22] tried and tested. It's not going to
[53:23] work.
[53:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:26] And it will lack. The one thing about
[53:28] this is because you're listening to
[53:30] brother Brandham constantly and only
[53:32] him, you are going to develop a
[53:34] masculine nature of the word.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; You will not develop the feminine nature
[53:39] of the bride.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; That's what's going to happen because
[53:43] you're just absorbing this from him who
[53:46] is the masculine seed of the age.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; Immediately you are going to be a
[53:51] headship over everyone else. We will
[53:54] never develop the feminine nature of the
[53:56] word.
[53:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Okay. So,
[54:00] our advice to the youth of this
[54:02] generation, do not look at doctrines of
[54:05] the past with any hate or animosity. No
[54:08] matter how you have suffered under it,
[54:10] if you are carrying animosity, you came
[54:12] from 77 virtues. They wrecked my life,
[54:14] they wrecked my family, they wreck
[54:16] wrecked this, they I suffered under
[54:18] this. Don't do that. Okay? What I want
[54:22] to tell you today is to try and get you
[54:24] out of that hole of victimhood.
[54:27] We must know that if it happened, God
[54:31] permitted it.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; He sent the prophet. He sent the
[54:36] messenger. He knew what everyone was
[54:39] going to do. He knew there were
[54:41] Pharisees going to be there. He knew
[54:43] there were Sadducees going to be there
[54:44] when he was coming in the first time. He
[54:46] knew Paul was going to be the the the
[54:48] apostle to the first church age. He knew
[54:51] it, right? God knew all this was going
[54:54] to happen and he permitted it. He even
[54:56] permitted it to last for three decades
[54:58] and then failed. Three decades. Think
[55:02] about it.
[55:04] So he saw that God saw the outcome and
[55:06] directed his prophet to speak uh exactly
[55:09] the way he had to do so and that it
[55:12] could be exactly the way it is for a
[55:14] purpose.
[55:16] So from my perspective, I grew up under
[55:18] a pastor who had
[55:21] my dad. My dad basically had all of them
[55:25] preach in our pulpit.
[55:27] Every single one of them doctrines.
[55:32] Whichever doctrine they were, he invited
[55:34] them. Let them preach. Right? Uh if they
[55:38] preached anything we did not believe in,
[55:40] my dad would never come up in the
[55:42] service and correct them. Yeah,
[55:44] &gt;&gt; he wouldn't even correct them on the
[55:46] pulpit the next week.
[55:49] He wasn't afraid of what our people were
[55:51] being taught.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; They would come, they would preach, he
[55:55] would brothers would come to him and
[55:57] they had a problem with it. They ask him
[55:59] and he'll show them this is what the
[56:00] prophet said or we'll have a little
[56:02] gathering and discussion at our home.
[56:04] But never once did he use the pulpit to
[56:07] correct another minister and blacken his
[56:10] name or tell our church people he's a
[56:12] false doctrine. I've got good witnesses
[56:13] sitting here who were there. He never
[56:16] had to do that. He remained friends till
[56:20] the day he died with all of them.
[56:25] I know my dad would go to the United
[56:27] States. I was there with him. We would
[56:29] go visit a brother who disagreed with us
[56:31] and we with him and have a chat and have
[56:35] tea and coffee and ice cream together
[56:37] and leave and hug one another. learn. He
[56:40] always told me about the ministries and
[56:43] and told me how this brother who
[56:44] preached this doctrine was such a
[56:46] gentleman. Those were the things I
[56:48] learned.
[56:49] Um
[56:52] some of the people sitting in here that
[56:54] are from Newcastle, you will remember my
[56:57] dad even had Pentecostal ministers
[56:59] preach for us.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal minister, friend traveling
[57:04] through Newcastle, stopped in for a
[57:06] Wednesday night. My dad was going to
[57:07] preach. said, "Come up, come and preach
[57:09] for us."
[57:13] Uh, in other churches, it's taboo to let
[57:15] a denominational person preach. There
[57:17] were times when my dad would do a
[57:19] funeral and he would preach the main
[57:21] service and let the denominational man
[57:23] do the committal at the burial
[57:25] or either way us or weddings or
[57:28] something. Get them involved with us.
[57:30] Not if we wouldn't do it. If we if we
[57:33] could get along with Pentecostal, you
[57:35] denominational ministers, why not even
[57:37] our brothers in the message who preach a
[57:39] different doctrine?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; That's how we grew up,
[57:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:44] &gt;&gt; The the the Pentecostal ministers would
[57:46] never when they joined us, even if they
[57:49] preached in our church, the Pentecostal
[57:51] ministers knew who we were. They knew
[57:52] where we were in the message. They felt
[57:54] we were a cult. They hated William
[57:57] Brandom. But if they preach from our
[57:58] pullpit, they would not touch it.
[58:00] They would respect us cuz we respected
[58:02] them. They would never stand there. I
[58:05] remember the services they preached.
[58:07] They would preach about the grace of the
[58:08] Lord Jesus Christ, the blood of
[58:10] salvation. They would bring messages of
[58:12] hope and encouragement. And our message
[58:15] people literally enjoyed it. Came
[58:18] afterwards. My dad would come afterwards
[58:20] and lead the people into worship and go
[58:22] outside, stand there and greet the
[58:23] brother and go home. No issue. Nobody in
[58:27] our church came to brother Steven said
[58:29] why did you have a denominational
[58:30] minister preaching because we grew up
[58:33] recognizing everyone as Christians
[58:37] and fellowship with all of them.
[58:42] Yeah, I know. There's going to be people
[58:43] telling me, "No, no, no, no. I'm sorry.
[58:47] Anything but that, that's a mark of the
[58:49] beast. That's just If you don't, if you
[58:52] know what's mark of the beast, you'll be
[58:54] shocked and you'll be looking to your
[58:56] left and your right.
[59:02] I'm not saying that to scare you. It's
[59:04] just simply the truth. I think it's too
[59:06] easy to label other people as mark of
[59:08] the beast."
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And there are a whole lot more
[59:11] sincere and followers of Christ and a
[59:13] lot of people who claim to be the
[59:15] message. We also have places where
[59:16] brother Baron says a lot of people you
[59:18] think will be there won't be there.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; A lot of people who you think won't be
[59:21] there will be there.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; I just had a a a minister friend of
[59:27] mine. We we're talking about it this
[59:30] week. He said to me, "Hey, brother, you
[59:32] know, it's so frustrating." We're
[59:34] talking about how frustrating it is
[59:35] sometimes with message people and we're
[59:37] talking about some of the judgmental
[59:40] uh people and I I just told him brother
[59:43] I'm going to use this that you told me.
[59:45] He said he told some people if it ever
[59:48] comes to the judgment and I have to be
[59:51] judged I don't want you judging me.
[59:56] I thought that was amazing. You know
[59:58] it's an amazing reality. You just ask
[1:00:01] yourself, just look around you in the
[1:00:02] message and ask yourselves if you want
[1:00:05] one of you judging everyone else and
[1:00:08] just think about it for a bit. Anyway,
[1:00:12] so
[1:00:13] growing up to this day, we we have kept
[1:00:16] good relations to this day. I keep good
[1:00:18] relations with all denominational
[1:00:20] friends, ministers. They love us, they
[1:00:23] respect us, we respect them. When they
[1:00:25] have prayer requests, they contact us to
[1:00:27] pray for them uh all the time. Every
[1:00:30] single year I get uh prayer requests
[1:00:33] from my denominational friends in in the
[1:00:35] ministry, ministers, pastors. We meet
[1:00:38] them at weddings and funerals and other
[1:00:40] functions. We collaborate with them. I
[1:00:43] mean some of my brothers, my siblings,
[1:00:47] they work with denominational groups for
[1:00:49] fundraisers for even their churches
[1:00:52] and uh doing things for charity work and
[1:00:55] stuff. We work with them. We It's easier
[1:00:58] to even work with them than to call a
[1:01:00] message church and say, "Let's go do a
[1:01:01] drive." Like, "No, sorry. We're wearing
[1:01:03] our t-shirts."
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; And yet, we will go and help them and
[1:01:09] pass out stuff and do stuff with them
[1:01:12] with the denominational church and they
[1:01:13] got no issue. They're so happy we're
[1:01:15] helping them, you know. And yet, we'll
[1:01:18] have another message person say, "What
[1:01:19] are you doing? You're you're you're
[1:01:22] promoting their thing." No, we're not.
[1:01:24] We're just feeding hungry people. What
[1:01:26] are you talking about? And if we get a
[1:01:28] chance to a hungry person, give him food
[1:01:31] and he asks us where you from, we tell
[1:01:33] them we're from this church.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; We're not telling them you have to go
[1:01:36] there cuz they're handling this. No, I
[1:01:38] they know we have the freedom to speak
[1:01:40] whatever we want to. But we can get
[1:01:42] along as Christians.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; And when we're with them on their drives
[1:01:49] or whatever and we're at weddings or
[1:01:51] functions, we never try to push the
[1:01:53] prophet at them. If I'm preaching at a
[1:01:56] wedding of uh somebody from our church
[1:01:59] marrying somebody from another church or
[1:02:01] from any other religion, you'll never
[1:02:04] find me on the pulpit slamming the other
[1:02:06] people's religion. But do not do that.
[1:02:09] Or or saying the prophet's name just
[1:02:12] because I know it annoys these
[1:02:14] denominational people. If if I even have
[1:02:16] to read a quote of the prophet, I say
[1:02:18] the prophet said. I don't even use his
[1:02:20] name because to me the most important
[1:02:23] thing is the two people getting married.
[1:02:25] Let's just start their day off with
[1:02:26] happiness and least amount of stress and
[1:02:29] we'll deal with everything else
[1:02:30] afterwards. But why must they spoil the
[1:02:32] wedding for them? Why use the pulpit at
[1:02:35] a funeral to smash the nominational
[1:02:38] people? Somebody has died and people are
[1:02:40] grieving.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Preach the word. Tell the truth.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:46] I tell you, and we've been doing this
[1:02:48] for years. I've never preached at a
[1:02:51] single place where somebody hasn't come
[1:02:53] up to me from a denominations or another
[1:02:55] religion saying, "You spoke the truth.
[1:02:57] You told us what we need and it's
[1:03:00] fantastic and it's amazing and thank
[1:03:02] you." And I mean, there'll be women
[1:03:05] standing in front of me with pants and
[1:03:06] doled up and makeup and earrings telling
[1:03:08] me how much they love the work.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; It's fine. They heard the truth. They
[1:03:15] accepted the truth
[1:03:19] but the only thing uh I know they all
[1:03:22] criticize me for is preaching too long
[1:03:25] and that I can deal with you know
[1:03:29] uh but um if anything I always get
[1:03:31] compliments from them. So the reason I'm
[1:03:33] saying all this is because uh from my
[1:03:36] youth young people and new people we
[1:03:40] have always served God in the message
[1:03:42] without fear. I've never lived in fear
[1:03:45] in this message and um never been
[1:03:48] controlled by my pastor. My point is if
[1:03:52] we get this right with unbelievers, why
[1:03:54] can we not get this right with
[1:03:55] believers, right? And we preach the
[1:03:58] word, we have no fear our people, I
[1:04:01] preach the word here without any fear of
[1:04:04] you falling away. To me, if you want to
[1:04:05] leave this church someday, you have my
[1:04:07] blessing. And then some of you will say,
[1:04:10] "But you don't care." No, I respect you.
[1:04:13] If you're making a choice, I'm
[1:04:14] respecting your choice. I'm not going to
[1:04:16] change your choice, right? Even if I
[1:04:19] love you, I'm going to tell you, listen,
[1:04:21] if you're choosing to go this way,
[1:04:22] here's what's going to happen. This is
[1:04:24] what you're going to face. And uh look,
[1:04:27] if things go bad, you're always welcome
[1:04:29] back, and we'll we'll be here to help
[1:04:31] you as best we can. But I'm not going to
[1:04:33] fight you. I'm not going to control you.
[1:04:36] I don't want to be controlled. So why
[1:04:38] must I control you?
[1:04:40] Right? So, and if people stay, it's
[1:04:43] because of their faith, their own faith.
[1:04:46] And we and not because we force you.
[1:04:49] There's not one person here who can tell
[1:04:50] me that I force you to stay in our
[1:04:52] church. You have the freedom to go and
[1:04:55] do whatever you need to. Okay?
[1:04:59] So, which brings us to the story of the
[1:05:01] message. Finally, story of the doctrines
[1:05:04] of the message. So, this may sound like
[1:05:06] it'll take a long, but you know, that
[1:05:08] depends on how well you can absorb
[1:05:11] Okay. So I just want to start by saying
[1:05:13] the ministry of the prophet young people
[1:05:16] the ministry of brother Brandon
[1:05:19] was unlike any other ministry of any
[1:05:23] prophet in the Bible.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; And I say that without
[1:05:29] favoritism. I got no reason to use
[1:05:31] favoritism.
[1:05:33] Not even Elijah, not even Moses, not any
[1:05:37] prophet in the Bible had a time like
[1:05:40] brother Bham was. To start off with,
[1:05:43] brother Benham was born in 1909. In
[1:05:46] 1906, the Pentecostal movement began in
[1:05:49] Isusa Street. Remember before 1906 there
[1:05:52] were all these American denominational
[1:05:54] churches filling America Episcopalian
[1:05:57] Baptist uh Methodist Lutheran Catholic
[1:06:00] all Protestant churches right then comes
[1:06:03] Isuza Street which comes in in a black
[1:06:05] church in California
[1:06:08] and then the Holy Ghost comes out with
[1:06:10] tongues interpretations prophecies and
[1:06:12] starts spreading through white churches
[1:06:14] in America and uh the Orthodox churches
[1:06:17] and they start to accept some of the
[1:06:19] movements and Then some of the white
[1:06:21] ministers and men and women start to
[1:06:24] embrace the outpouring of the of the
[1:06:26] Holy Ghost. And that starts to shift and
[1:06:29] those churches start to become a little
[1:06:30] bit more um uh uh lively in accepting
[1:06:35] the anointing and accepting new
[1:06:37] revelation. Right? And then brother is
[1:06:40] born in 1909.
[1:06:42] He is the only prophet to live and
[1:06:45] preach through two world wars.
[1:06:49] world wars, including a nuclear bomb
[1:06:52] being dropped.
[1:06:54] He's the only prophet who lived through
[1:06:58] drugs
[1:07:00] being mass-roduced,
[1:07:03] alcohol being mass-roduced. I'm telling
[1:07:06] you, Moses did not have to deal with
[1:07:08] mass-produced alcohol, mass-produced
[1:07:10] smoking, mass-produced drugs.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; He's the only prophet to live through
[1:07:15] rock and roll.
[1:07:18] He's the only prophet who lived through
[1:07:20] women's skirts coming up to here and
[1:07:22] their neck lines dropping to there and
[1:07:25] high heels and painted faces and
[1:07:28] earrings and hair cut like boys. There's
[1:07:32] never been another prophet in history
[1:07:34] who faced such things.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Worldwide movements.
[1:07:38] There's never been another prophet who
[1:07:40] had to face rock and roll, pop, jazz,
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; brass band, Hollywood,
[1:07:50] women's liberation, abortion,
[1:07:55] conservative and liberal politics.
[1:07:57] Before you try and knock the prophet
[1:07:59] down, think back and show me one prophet
[1:08:02] in the Bible or in the history of
[1:08:05] Christianity who had to live through
[1:08:06] something like that. who had to bring a
[1:08:09] word to the people and correct their
[1:08:11] behavior while giving them the truth.
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Not a single prophet. Not even the Lord
[1:08:18] Jesus Christ.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. Why did it make such
[1:08:26] an impact upon the world at the time?
[1:08:28] Because they couldn't deny and refute
[1:08:30] the things he was telling them.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. You had you literally had
[1:08:35] ministers come out of a of a church
[1:08:37] preach and their congregants are smoking
[1:08:41] in the churchyard or they're having
[1:08:43] fundraisers where they're selling
[1:08:44] alcohol and people are getting drunk in
[1:08:47] a Methodist church.
[1:08:49] And here comes this humble Kentucky who
[1:08:52] is not even educated. He comes from this
[1:08:55] backward place and he comes in front of
[1:08:58] all these educated theolog theologians
[1:09:01] and speaks the word and he's got science
[1:09:04] to back it up.
[1:09:06] Do you agree with me? There's never been
[1:09:08] a ministry like this one.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; This is not me make this is you. You are
[1:09:14] agreeing with it because you know it is
[1:09:15] the actual truth of our day. Amen.
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; There has never been a ministry, not
[1:09:20] even Billy Graham and Oral Roberts, who
[1:09:22] took it upon themselves to correct the
[1:09:25] deeds of the of the of America,
[1:09:28] to shout back against Hollywood, to tell
[1:09:30] them they're destroying the youth with
[1:09:32] drugs and alcohol. Of course, they talk
[1:09:35] diplomatically.
[1:09:37] He was a true Elijah. He was not
[1:09:39] diplomatic. He called it like he saw it.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; And they didn't like him for that.
[1:09:45] Now what I'm saying to you is that's
[1:09:46] where it begins
[1:09:48] right then he dies and his death leaves
[1:09:52] turmoil amongst the people who had
[1:09:54] accepted his word because he told them
[1:09:57] the coming of the lord is at hand and
[1:10:00] many other things. So immediately the
[1:10:02] first thing that comes up is seven men,
[1:10:04] seven voices, seven thunders starts to
[1:10:06] go and people now those seven men who
[1:10:09] became the seven thunders actually
[1:10:11] didn't even agree with each other. So
[1:10:13] they already had problems with that from
[1:10:15] the get-go.
[1:10:17] What was the main This is the story of
[1:10:19] the doctrines of the message. What is
[1:10:21] the main problem they all had? So they
[1:10:23] all agreed God sent a prophet. They all
[1:10:26] were very excited with triple 6 being
[1:10:28] revealed. explained the the mark of the
[1:10:31] beast. They were very excited. They were
[1:10:32] very excited to push back against the
[1:10:34] Catholic Church. They were very excited
[1:10:36] to push back against Pentecostalism.
[1:10:38] They were united in that. They were
[1:10:40] united in baptism and godhead and
[1:10:42] serpent seed. They were very knit with
[1:10:45] that. What was the problem? The seventh
[1:10:47] seal.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; All the doctrines that we have been
[1:10:51] through are about the seventh seal.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; How is it this related to the first
[1:10:55] coming? Because the seventh seal is
[1:10:57] about the second coming. Amen.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Right. So every doctrine that came up
[1:11:04] young people is because of the seven
[1:11:06] seal.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; So but they most of the brothers at the
[1:11:11] time decided let's just push the seven
[1:11:13] seal aside. Let's not talk about it.
[1:11:15] Let's agree to talk about the stuff we
[1:11:17] agree with. That's already starting to
[1:11:20] sound nickelan.
[1:11:22] Right? But it had good reason and God
[1:11:25] permitted it. Why? Because inside of
[1:11:28] these brothers, they had a passion. He's
[1:11:30] gone. Let's take it to the world. Let's
[1:11:34] travel the globe. Let's take it to the
[1:11:35] world. And that's what they did. They
[1:11:37] printed the message in simplicity. They
[1:11:39] took the books and tapes at that time
[1:11:42] all over the world and it became a
[1:11:43] passion. They came to Africa with barely
[1:11:46] any money. They brought books here with
[1:11:49] with them. They lived. They came here
[1:11:51] not knowing anybody. While we were
[1:11:53] fighting through a partade, they were
[1:11:55] taking books. There were many of them
[1:11:57] thrown in prison. Thrown in prison in
[1:11:59] Russia, in China, in Europe, went across
[1:12:02] the world, took whatever little money
[1:12:05] they had and took the message across the
[1:12:07] people, changing communities, baptizing
[1:12:10] people, taking people out of
[1:12:11] denominational strongholds. This is what
[1:12:14] these brothers did. You can fault them
[1:12:16] for not being for not knowing what the
[1:12:18] seventh seal is, but if they knew what
[1:12:21] the seventh seal was, they wouldn't have
[1:12:23] traveled.
[1:12:24] True.
[1:12:25] This is the thing they would they would
[1:12:27] have stayed back and decided let's
[1:12:29] study. Let's get to know this. Let's in
[1:12:31] the meantime the word is not spreading.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; So God had to use this lack of knowledge
[1:12:36] of the seven seal to inspire them to
[1:12:38] take the word to the world.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Set up churches, set up libraries, set
[1:12:42] up printing presses, set up schools in
[1:12:45] some places.
[1:12:48] And their passion was spreading the
[1:12:51] message. brother, sister, it was nothing
[1:12:54] short of amazing. I have the greatest
[1:12:57] respect for them because I I don't think
[1:13:00] I could could have done that. Somewhere
[1:13:02] along the line, men who were with the
[1:13:05] prophet, who remained in the United
[1:13:07] States, were not traveling, started
[1:13:10] spreading the notion of presenting the
[1:13:14] word by beginning with the prophet's
[1:13:16] name.
[1:13:18] So the idea a culture began when you
[1:13:21] meet somebody new you start with have
[1:13:23] you heard of William Brandham
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; it worked for a while because like who's
[1:13:30] William Brand you know a great prophet
[1:13:32] Malachi 4 Malachi 4:5 and 6 and you
[1:13:35] start there and the people people at
[1:13:36] that time were just like fresh into
[1:13:38] Christianity or something and they oh
[1:13:40] yeah really yeah and do you know Christ
[1:13:43] came back in 90 no 1963 February 28
[1:13:47] cloud appears in the sky. They were not
[1:13:48] even too sure. But great great anointing
[1:13:51] came down and this man and play a tape
[1:13:53] for him, give him a track and show them
[1:13:55] about the the the uh Godhead and
[1:13:58] something against the Catholic Church or
[1:14:00] something and it was phenomenal. People
[1:14:01] started responding.
[1:14:04] The only issue is how long can you keep
[1:14:07] telling people have you heard of William
[1:14:09] Brandon? At some some point you have to
[1:14:11] slow down because then everyone knew
[1:14:14] about it
[1:14:16] and not everything was good. See the
[1:14:18] moment you have you heard of William
[1:14:20] Brandham? Yes. Please don't tell me
[1:14:21] anymore. Thank you. Goodbye.
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; That's where we are today.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Right. So that can no longer be your
[1:14:28] line of evangelism.
[1:14:32] So you can say it is wrong now and you
[1:14:35] may be right that God should that we
[1:14:38] should not do that now but God allowed
[1:14:40] it then and it would cause some to
[1:14:42] reject and some to accept but then like
[1:14:45] with the first coming what happens is it
[1:14:48] doesn't even take a few years and human
[1:14:50] leadership starts to step in okay who's
[1:14:53] the main leader now that the prophet is
[1:14:54] off the scene some brothers would say I
[1:14:57] think it's brother so and so another
[1:14:58] another group would say no I think it's
[1:15:00] brother so and so another And then
[1:15:01] people form a movement around him and a
[1:15:03] church and that church is set up. That's
[1:15:06] how quick, right? And the problem was
[1:15:10] the message churches began to form and
[1:15:12] men who were with the prophet were
[1:15:14] immediately given more importance than
[1:15:17] others
[1:15:18] only because these men were with the
[1:15:20] prophet. They saw his life. Their
[1:15:23] stories were amazing. The testimonies
[1:15:25] were amazing. But they had no ministry.
[1:15:27] They couldn't preach. If you are to ask
[1:15:29] them about the seven seal, they didn't
[1:15:30] know anything. All they knew was the
[1:15:33] services, the anointing, the healing
[1:15:35] lines, the discernment. They could go on
[1:15:37] for hours and hours and hours and hours
[1:15:39] and tell you about it. And then the
[1:15:41] brothers who were elected pastors,
[1:15:44] they were actually evangelists with
[1:15:46] itchy feet.
[1:15:49] They were not really pastors.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Right. They really didn't want to sit
[1:15:53] home and spend 10 years teaching a
[1:15:55] church. They were so fired up and
[1:15:58] passionate. They were evangelists. They
[1:15:59] wanted to go to Africa and to Malawi in
[1:16:02] Africa and and to Zer in the Congo and
[1:16:05] they wanted to go to North Africa and
[1:16:07] China and they wanted to bust up Russia
[1:16:10] and get through the iron curtain and all
[1:16:12] this. Oh, they were amazing. That's what
[1:16:14] they wanted. But that's not a pastor.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; So, what happens when the pastor who's
[1:16:20] actually an evangelist leaves and goes
[1:16:22] away for a whole month? What happens
[1:16:24] behind?
[1:16:25] Right? So the truth is they didn't see
[1:16:28] this as a problem. And at that time
[1:16:30] you're talking about the 1960s and '7s.
[1:16:33] If you're a pastor at that time of a
[1:16:34] group of church that has just started,
[1:16:36] just simple people. They started with no
[1:16:38] microphones, keyboards,
[1:16:41] uh mixers, all this stuff that we have,
[1:16:44] cameras, perfect sound. They had like a
[1:16:47] accordion, a banjo. They had no
[1:16:50] microphones that they just had small
[1:16:52] little groups who would sit around
[1:16:53] together. a woman play a tamarine and it
[1:16:55] was wonderful.
[1:17:00] And the pastors didn't have a problem
[1:17:02] with not teaching. They were they were
[1:17:04] like and think about this. If you were
[1:17:05] in that time, you would just say, "Bring
[1:17:07] them in. Come on, get baptized right
[1:17:10] now. If you believe it, get baptized
[1:17:12] right now. Give up your sinful ways.
[1:17:14] Commit to Christ. Here's the books.
[1:17:16] Read. Teach yourself.
[1:17:19] Just read the message. Learn by
[1:17:20] yourself. You will as you read the Holy
[1:17:23] Spirit will reveal it to you. Don't
[1:17:24] worry, the raptor is happening soon.
[1:17:25] Could be tomorrow
[1:17:28] and you just stay here, read the books.
[1:17:30] Don't worry, we we're moving to Africa
[1:17:32] next week. And you go to Africa and
[1:17:35] you're thinking the church is fine.
[1:17:38] And we cannot fault them for thinking
[1:17:40] like that. As people began to come in
[1:17:42] while the pastors were away, books were
[1:17:45] being printed, libraries were being set
[1:17:47] up elsewhere, questions and answers
[1:17:50] started to happen. Questions started
[1:17:52] arising. One brother in the church while
[1:17:54] the pastor was away thought he could
[1:17:56] answer. Then teachers started coming up.
[1:17:59] Right? So in the meantime uh in in the
[1:18:02] time where not everyone had a great
[1:18:05] understanding and very few books were
[1:18:06] printed they majored on what would
[1:18:09] happen when there's fewer books.
[1:18:12] What would the church depend on? Gifts
[1:18:14] of the Holy Ghost. So every church that
[1:18:18] came in reading the prophet listening to
[1:18:20] the message every person had a gift.
[1:18:24] Dreams, visions, prophecies, tongues and
[1:18:28] interpretations. And that went on for a
[1:18:30] whole decade
[1:18:33] because everybody had to have it.
[1:18:36] I mean, they would be so prophetic they
[1:18:38] would tell you what you're having for
[1:18:40] tea after the service.
[1:18:43] Someone had a dream about it.
[1:18:47] I'm not kidding you. This is how
[1:18:50] prophetic they were. It was all
[1:18:51] nonsense.
[1:18:54] There were there were very few true
[1:18:56] gifts and many false gifts that came up
[1:19:00] because of a culture, right? Many
[1:19:03] ministries didn't even help bring
[1:19:05] maturity with all these gifts flying
[1:19:07] around. They just encouraged I tell you
[1:19:09] how bad it was. We ended up with
[1:19:11] churches here in Durban where one person
[1:19:14] would dream that that sister must marry
[1:19:16] that brother
[1:19:18] and God showed it to them. God showed it
[1:19:20] to them. They married, they divorced in
[1:19:22] one year.
[1:19:25] What happened? That sister was
[1:19:27] influenced by the parents to have a
[1:19:30] prophecy to make them get married
[1:19:33] because it was in somebody's interest.
[1:19:35] It happened here in Dublin. We had
[1:19:37] plenty of situations like that. Of
[1:19:40] course, it happens in the Pentecostal
[1:19:41] churches. It's like it's like co out
[1:19:44] there.
[1:19:47] And they think they can fool us in the
[1:19:49] Pentecostal churches.
[1:19:50] you you can be sitting at at a meeting
[1:19:52] and you hear someone stand up with a
[1:19:54] with tongues and interpretation that we
[1:19:56] just know. We know what this is. We've
[1:19:57] seen it before, right?
[1:20:00] So there were many true gifts. There
[1:20:03] were true gifts but much more false
[1:20:05] gifts that began to rise and nobody
[1:20:07] questioned it because they were afraid
[1:20:09] to question it. Teachers suddenly
[1:20:12] someone came up and said there needs to
[1:20:14] be a five-fold ministry. So a teacher,
[1:20:16] we must have a teacher. We must have a
[1:20:18] pastor. We must have an evangelist. We
[1:20:19] must have an apostle. We must have this
[1:20:20] set up. And all the churches must have
[1:20:22] this. And they're not realizing the
[1:20:24] teacher who's going to rise up. He's
[1:20:26] going to be dedicating himself to
[1:20:27] teaching. He's not going to get in
[1:20:28] tithes because all the tithes goes to
[1:20:30] the pastor. But the teacher is now going
[1:20:32] to teach things and it's going to
[1:20:33] conflict with the pastor. And they
[1:20:34] didn't realize it's going to happen. And
[1:20:36] then the teacher is going to get kicked
[1:20:38] out. Then the teacher was going to
[1:20:40] think, "Okay, is that how you're going
[1:20:41] to treat me? All I was doing was good
[1:20:43] for you. Fine. I'm going to travel to
[1:20:45] all the other churches and teach. And
[1:20:46] that's what they did. They start
[1:20:48] traveling from church to church. And
[1:20:50] this poor teacher not realizing he's
[1:20:52] going to break up every church is going
[1:20:53] to teach at
[1:20:56] literally happened. Okay. Eventually
[1:20:58] there came a split in the ministry as
[1:21:01] and we we still looking at the 70s,
[1:21:03] right? 60s moving to the 70s. Teachers
[1:21:06] began to settle some qualms about the
[1:21:08] message, but they couldn't answer the
[1:21:11] seven se.
[1:21:13] So they came to split in the ministry.
[1:21:15] As more brothers couldn't see eye to eye
[1:21:17] on the seventh seal, questions arose
[1:21:20] about the seals and the thunders. And at
[1:21:22] that time the community of the message
[1:21:24] was so small.
[1:21:26] Uh nobody could really identify which
[1:21:28] doctrine started where, right? Uh and it
[1:21:32] was more like you're speaking about
[1:21:33] something, something gets believed and
[1:21:36] and then you talk more about it and you
[1:21:38] know, but you don't really know. this
[1:21:40] brother started it on the 7th of May
[1:21:43] this and that and that. No, nobody knows
[1:21:45] it. So the simplest way that the people
[1:21:48] at the time believed that we should
[1:21:51] approach the seven seal and seven
[1:21:52] thunders was simply this that the seven
[1:21:56] thunders were the revelations of the
[1:21:58] seventh seal. So one thunder, one seal.
[1:22:01] One thunder, one seal. One thunder, one
[1:22:02] seal. Because brother Brandon said they
[1:22:06] are the seven divinely revealed mystery
[1:22:07] truths contained in the seven seals. So
[1:22:10] that became a common thread and everyone
[1:22:12] believes the revelation of one seal is
[1:22:14] the thunder. Have you heard that?
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. That that's a very common thing.
[1:22:20] So uh most believers at this time
[1:22:24] were in North America were from North
[1:22:26] America. And here's a here's the thing
[1:22:28] now where you find doctrines come from a
[1:22:30] cultural place, right? The believers in
[1:22:33] North America at that time were very
[1:22:36] conservative and very legalistic
[1:22:39] people and uh their cultures were that
[1:22:42] way and they were dedicated to spreading
[1:22:44] the message and keeping it in the spirit
[1:22:47] that brother Brandham left it. That's
[1:22:49] what they thought they were doing. So
[1:22:51] they started the notion that the prophet
[1:22:53] is returning when they read the quotes
[1:22:55] on the 10 vision which they started the
[1:22:59] return ministry. The return ministry
[1:23:01] started among friends of the prophet and
[1:23:04] people who were there after he died and
[1:23:07] and and um because they couldn't make
[1:23:09] sense of the seventh seal. He must come
[1:23:11] back and make everything right. Got it.
[1:23:15] Quite easy.
[1:23:17] Uh so we are not sure of the exact date
[1:23:20] and time
[1:23:22] uh but something happened to combat this
[1:23:26] return ministry and it is the doctrine
[1:23:28] we know as the seven thunders seven
[1:23:30] virtues. It was not just combating the
[1:23:33] return ministry it was also combating
[1:23:35] the um the the the group of friends that
[1:23:39] were with the prophet and this doctrine
[1:23:42] started in New York City. It began to
[1:23:44] grow and spread the faster than any
[1:23:47] other doctor. It was like like weeds.
[1:23:51] Not any slight on it, but it that's how
[1:23:54] fast it was moving. And here's the
[1:23:56] problem. South Africans, it grew the
[1:23:58] fastest here in South Africa.
[1:24:02] It was sweeping. It was vibrant. It was
[1:24:04] charismatic. It was led by an anointed,
[1:24:07] knowledgeable, gifted group of men.
[1:24:10] These men were not just readers of the
[1:24:12] message, students of the message. They
[1:24:15] had a gift of moving a crowd. You could
[1:24:19] be sitting among them and you would
[1:24:20] literally stand up and feel like doing
[1:24:22] what they're doing because you feel like
[1:24:24] a total idiot if you're not doing what
[1:24:27] they're doing. That's how gifted they
[1:24:29] were.
[1:24:31] And the crowd would be moved and they
[1:24:33] when they preached they became like
[1:24:36] fluent in like phrases, catchphrases and
[1:24:40] buzzwords and colloial expressions. I
[1:24:42] mean a brother would just say my my my
[1:24:44] my
[1:24:48] eruption. All he said was my my my my.
[1:24:54] That's how charismatic they were,
[1:24:57] right? I mean they would never mind
[1:25:01] rather not say that
[1:25:04] they became known for these buzzwords
[1:25:05] colloial expressions antics dancing
[1:25:09] jumping shouting when I mean jumping and
[1:25:13] shouting I mean can you imagine while
[1:25:15] I'm preaching all of you just doing this
[1:25:18] while I'm preaching
[1:25:21] constantly
[1:25:22] for 15 minutes those guys must have had
[1:25:26] killer calves
[1:25:29] Right.
[1:25:32] They had completely over-the-top
[1:25:34] emotions, catchy songs, songs. Some of
[1:25:37] the most beautiful songs, you know, like
[1:25:40] and and fantastic. Charity never
[1:25:42] faileth. No, no, no. Charity never
[1:25:45] faileth. No, no, no. Um, it is the
[1:25:49] dynamics to my mechanics. Seven thunders
[1:25:51] gives rapturing faith. Charity never
[1:25:53] failth. No, no, no. Brilliant.
[1:25:59] Songs were written, catchy tunes, catchy
[1:26:02] movements, rhythms and gifts of the Holy
[1:26:05] Ghost of all kinds filled the church. It
[1:26:08] swept through Africa. When I say swept
[1:26:10] through Africa, I mean it just came
[1:26:12] through and liberated all the
[1:26:14] non-whites.
[1:26:20] That's what happened. You see, it became
[1:26:23] in our country, it became the perfect
[1:26:25] thing to fight back against the white
[1:26:27] man because the white man was the cold
[1:26:29] formal legalist who was sticking with
[1:26:32] brother so and so from America. So
[1:26:35] amongst the blacks, colored Indians,
[1:26:37] this thing was phenomenal because it put
[1:26:40] us into this power where we these white
[1:26:43] guys were not they don't have what we
[1:26:45] have. We've got the power. It
[1:26:47] immediately went to race. That's what I
[1:26:49] hated about it being here. immediately
[1:26:52] went to this thing like we were we were
[1:26:54] one group of people and we were fighting
[1:26:56] against another. That's not what the
[1:26:58] message came to do.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; And they didn't realize it. Even though
[1:27:02] they were not openly preaching it, they
[1:27:04] were racist.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; I know. I sat among them. I heard them
[1:27:11] talk about the white man and talk about
[1:27:12] this and that's a white thing and that's
[1:27:14] a white thing. This is not a true
[1:27:17] doctrine of God to be able to do that. I
[1:27:19] don't care whether you came up under
[1:27:21] slavery,
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; or aparate or whatever. The moment you
[1:27:27] take the gospel of God and go to racism,
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; it's a filthy spirit.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; That's not who we are.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; We are called from every kindred nation,
[1:27:37] tribe, and tongue.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what victim you are,
[1:27:40] where you came from, whether you're on
[1:27:42] the other side. And let me tell you, on
[1:27:43] the other side, the same story. The
[1:27:45] white believer was, "Look at this bunch
[1:27:47] of univilized. Look how they're acting.
[1:27:50] This is why because they're uneducated
[1:27:52] and univilized." It was the same. Both
[1:27:54] sides didn't realize they were all
[1:27:56] racist.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Most people couldn't even identify these
[1:28:04] folks by their doctrine. They used to
[1:28:07] call them the thunders movement because
[1:28:09] of their behavior. If you ask majority
[1:28:11] of the people in the message in South
[1:28:13] Africa what they taught, nobody knows.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; All they know is they they teach the
[1:28:17] seven thunders as the virtues, but
[1:28:19] everyone knows by the how they shout and
[1:28:21] scream and perform.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And like if you go to a convention, you
[1:28:26] just know the thunders people because
[1:28:27] they're all the ones jumping up in
[1:28:29] front.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Screaming in the pastor's face,
[1:28:32] shouting, running up, banging pulpits,
[1:28:34] banging here, falling on the floor.
[1:28:36] Everyone sits there thinking, "Oh, there
[1:28:38] they go again." these thunders people.
[1:28:42] You come out of the service, brother,
[1:28:44] how was the service? Oh, it was
[1:28:45] thundering
[1:28:48] and you know he's criticizing the
[1:28:50] thunders movement. It was thundering,
[1:28:52] brother. It was thundering.
[1:28:55] We've been through all that. Okay? And
[1:28:58] so, everybody could give the label to
[1:29:01] who they are, but they couldn't explain.
[1:29:04] And you know when I was younger I read
[1:29:08] what they believed. I went through their
[1:29:10] doctrines. Even here I think it would
[1:29:12] have been just before 2012 20 2011 2012
[1:29:17] we preached I preached to you and I did
[1:29:19] all the ministries that came up after
[1:29:21] the prophet and went through what their
[1:29:23] doctrines were for the people at that
[1:29:24] time. It was phenomenal the things they
[1:29:28] taught right and uh the doctrine was
[1:29:32] very attractive because of uh it it was
[1:29:36] supporting the seven seals being open
[1:29:38] and supporting the thunders while
[1:29:39] everyone else was shutting it down.
[1:29:42] Right? God want what was God doing? Why
[1:29:44] was he allowing this? Because he wanted
[1:29:45] the people to push forward.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; From staying this side of Jordan.
[1:29:51] This ministry brought something to the
[1:29:53] forefront that people could be brave,
[1:29:55] could be courageous. They could stake
[1:29:57] their claim on the opening of the
[1:29:59] seventh seal. They could stake their
[1:30:00] claim on the thunders being revealed.
[1:30:02] And people started getting brave enough
[1:30:04] to read the message and open their eyes
[1:30:06] to it. God allowed it.
[1:30:10] And uh you know looking that at the age
[1:30:14] the age started in 1906 with Isuza
[1:30:16] Street in Pentecostal church and then
[1:30:18] they organized the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:20] Ghost and here God has to allow this
[1:30:22] movement to come in the message to bring
[1:30:25] back this anointing.
[1:30:29] But what happened was you have uh the
[1:30:33] conservative people started preaching
[1:30:36] out against them. The conservative
[1:30:38] legalist started calling them uh
[1:30:41] Thunderbirds from New York and
[1:30:44] Pentecostal pussycats.
[1:30:47] And then the seven thunders group
[1:30:49] started calling the the legalist serpent
[1:30:53] sea.
[1:30:57] I mean, you're already talking about the
[1:30:58] 70s.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; Not even not even 10 years past the
[1:31:02] prophet, they're already calling each
[1:31:03] other names.
[1:31:05] And so what happened is when this side
[1:31:07] started speaking against this one and
[1:31:09] this one started speaking against this
[1:31:10] one, they both doubled down. They made
[1:31:13] themselves double strong and the
[1:31:16] thunders group doubled down and became
[1:31:18] even more shouty
[1:31:21] more and and with that they became more
[1:31:23] liberal and the legalists became more
[1:31:26] legalistic and distanced themselves and
[1:31:29] separated and started preaching not to
[1:31:31] join them not to join them. Then as it
[1:31:34] happens with every movement that is
[1:31:36] founded uh or rather that is not founded
[1:31:39] in truth and honesty the thunders group
[1:31:42] began to have internal problems human
[1:31:44] leadership and gifts out of control
[1:31:48] caused them all to have problems such
[1:31:50] problems that I mean it went to marital
[1:31:53] problems immorality problems
[1:31:54] unrighteousness affecting even
[1:31:57] leadership amongst the movement
[1:32:00] at first being so united and dedicated
[1:32:03] in spreading their new found belief.
[1:32:05] They were now divided based on personal
[1:32:07] differences. As it got to the 80s, they
[1:32:09] were already dividing. This one speaking
[1:32:11] against that one, this one against that
[1:32:12] one, this one having more anointing than
[1:32:14] the other one. This one closer to the
[1:32:16] big guy. Already in the 80s, it was
[1:32:19] rife, right? And they went for three
[1:32:22] decades strong, holding strong,
[1:32:25] separating, but still
[1:32:27] holding strong until it just died in the
[1:32:30] 2000s.
[1:32:32] Like I mean it fell flat.
[1:32:35] Many of them distanced themselves from
[1:32:37] it saying we disagree with the main guy.
[1:32:39] We disagree with this one. We disagree
[1:32:40] with we're independent. They left it but
[1:32:43] it never left them.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; We all know that cuz the behavior is
[1:32:49] still the same.
[1:32:53] And basically what hit them is
[1:32:55] corruption of the gifts because you how
[1:32:57] do you tell a person who is speaking in
[1:32:59] tongues and prophesying that he's
[1:33:01] speaking wrong? How do you tell them
[1:33:02] after you bred it into them that they
[1:33:04] must do that
[1:33:06] that they must jump shout scream? How do
[1:33:08] you how when you know someone is has an
[1:33:11] immoral problem in the church and they
[1:33:13] faint in every service with the Holy
[1:33:15] Ghost. How do you correct that? Because
[1:33:17] you made them believe they can have the
[1:33:19] Holy Ghost and keep come back and repeat
[1:33:21] and repeat.
[1:33:24] They got the dynamics but they sleeping
[1:33:27] with someone else's wife.
[1:33:31] There were arguments about the
[1:33:32] legitimacy of the church age book. And
[1:33:35] this is the problem we had. While the
[1:33:37] thunders group is having their issues,
[1:33:40] the legalist group is having its issues.
[1:33:42] Suddenly there's these people in North
[1:33:44] America started having issues about the
[1:33:46] church ages. They're saying the church
[1:33:48] age book was written by a brother not by
[1:33:50] the prophet. Once they did that they
[1:33:53] canled out the quote that says this.
[1:33:56] Let's look at this quote from Leodysian
[1:33:57] church age. If you break out the church
[1:34:00] age book and and say it's not written by
[1:34:02] the prophet you break out this this me
[1:34:04] the messenger of Malachi 4 revelations
[1:34:06] 10:7 is going to do two things. One
[1:34:08] according to Malachi 4 he will turn our
[1:34:10] hearts to the children to the fathers.
[1:34:11] two, he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:34:13] seven thunders in revelations 10, which
[1:34:15] are the revelations contained in the
[1:34:16] seven seals. It will be these divinely
[1:34:19] revealed mystery truths that literally
[1:34:20] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:34:22] Pentecostal fathers. If you cut out the
[1:34:23] church age book, you cut out quotes like
[1:34:25] this and many other things. And when you
[1:34:27] cut this out, you do not see the the
[1:34:30] thunders being part of the seven seals
[1:34:32] that were preached.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Why? Simply because of disagreements
[1:34:36] between brothers who chose to demonize
[1:34:39] one particular one.
[1:34:41] and God permitted this.
[1:34:44] So this led to many of the legalists uh
[1:34:47] to conclude that the prophet made many
[1:34:49] errors and they were going to correct
[1:34:51] the prophet on his errors. Which brings
[1:34:53] us to the 1977
[1:34:55] debacle
[1:34:57] because brother Bar said I predict I do
[1:35:00] not prophesy that the ushering in of the
[1:35:03] millennium will be in 1977.
[1:35:05] If you only know what happened here in
[1:35:08] South Africa,
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; there was a fellow who claimed, come not
[1:35:13] at your wives, sell your homes, sell
[1:35:16] your cars, live perfect. The rapture is
[1:35:18] taking place in 1977.
[1:35:21] But the man said, "I predict, I do not
[1:35:22] prophesy, it will be the ushering in of
[1:35:24] the millennium." He didn't say the
[1:35:26] rapture is taking place. He didn't say a
[1:35:27] translation. That's all he said. The
[1:35:29] ushering in of the millennium. They went
[1:35:32] berserk.
[1:35:34] The ministers, can you imagine stayed
[1:35:36] away from their wives for a whole year?
[1:35:39] These guys kept it until the guy who
[1:35:42] started it, they found his wife was
[1:35:43] pregnant the next year.
[1:35:47] But that's how bad it was. And they were
[1:35:49] seriously to this day, they seriously
[1:35:52] criticized the message because they
[1:35:53] believe he preached the wrong doctrine.
[1:35:55] But yet, if you go and read the quotes,
[1:35:57] it doesn't tell you to do that.
[1:36:00] This brought a lot of discouragement to
[1:36:03] many. But after the effects wore off,
[1:36:05] both legalists and now liberals of North
[1:36:07] America began to grow in numbers and
[1:36:10] strengthen their sides and the influence
[1:36:12] uh both liberals and legalists began to
[1:36:15] race to bring more people in. They
[1:36:18] traveled the globe. They set up
[1:36:19] churches. They set up libraries. They
[1:36:21] printed books. And while all this was
[1:36:24] happening and they're fighting among
[1:36:25] seven thunders perusia or seven thunders
[1:36:28] return ministry seven seal open ABCs all
[1:36:31] they were fighting against each other
[1:36:34] because the books were being printed and
[1:36:35] and were being taken small ministries
[1:36:38] begin to rise everywhere in the
[1:36:41] strangest ways ministers started coming
[1:36:44] from hearing the message on a train on
[1:36:47] buses on planes on ships in street
[1:36:51] corners
[1:36:52] at the beach. There'd be some evangelist
[1:36:56] preaching at the beach and someone would
[1:36:57] come in and get baptized right there.
[1:36:59] The weirdest, strangest places, the
[1:37:02] message was we had
[1:37:06] reports of a brother who received the
[1:37:08] message
[1:37:09] because a message book was left in the
[1:37:12] toilet to be used as toilet paper.
[1:37:15] He goes to this public toilet, picks up
[1:37:17] this book, reads it, turns over, sees
[1:37:20] the address, contacts the pastor, and
[1:37:22] comes into the message.
[1:37:26] We were one of those independent
[1:37:28] churches who received we received the
[1:37:29] message in Newcastle.
[1:37:31] And from the get-go of receiving the
[1:37:33] message, we were told from day one, do
[1:37:36] not believe or listen to anyone who
[1:37:38] talks about seventh seal, seven
[1:37:40] thunders, or third pole. Imagine
[1:37:42] receiving the message that way.
[1:37:44] Right. What they didn't realize was the
[1:37:47] more they told us not to,
[1:37:50] the more we were going to get into it.
[1:37:53] They were actually by telling us not to
[1:37:55] do this, they were pointing at it and
[1:37:57] all the independent ministries began to
[1:37:59] study, look at it. Now the books were
[1:38:01] coming to them and independent
[1:38:03] ministries began to see the the word for
[1:38:05] themselves without relying on seven
[1:38:07] thunders virtues or peruia or return
[1:38:10] ministry. We're not even hearing those
[1:38:11] things. We're just reading the message
[1:38:13] and growing.
[1:38:16] So, not long after this, the Peruia
[1:38:18] doctrine comes in, which as I explained
[1:38:21] to you how it is, but basically it was
[1:38:24] in reaction to what the others were
[1:38:27] teaching. Got it? And was completely the
[1:38:31] the doctrine itself was completely
[1:38:33] amazing in its explanation. But for more
[1:38:36] than a decade, they were very excited to
[1:38:38] teach it. They spread it through their
[1:38:40] churches to the ministers who agreed
[1:38:43] with them. But after a decade, they
[1:38:46] started losing their children. Children
[1:38:48] started backsliding. Churches in this
[1:38:50] this movement were left with just old
[1:38:52] people holding up the fort.
[1:38:55] Because if you're teaching legalism,
[1:38:58] this is what's going to happen to your
[1:38:59] young people, right? And uh so to be
[1:39:02] able to try and keep the young people,
[1:39:04] they had to get the people back to
[1:39:06] preaching a holy clothes line, uh
[1:39:08] dressing right, double down on laws,
[1:39:10] standards of the message, standards of
[1:39:12] COD, and stay with the ABCs. People,
[1:39:15] simple people, that's all they wanted to
[1:39:17] do. They couldn't understand this this
[1:39:19] intellectualism, right? So the simple
[1:39:24] people in the message would not teach
[1:39:26] any doctrines. Like we had majority of
[1:39:28] people here in Durban for many many
[1:39:30] years would not even touch the seven
[1:39:33] seal of the thunders. They for many
[1:39:36] years said stay away from the deep
[1:39:37] things. Stay with the ABCs. Do not
[1:39:39] believe brother so and so. Do not
[1:39:41] believe brother so and so. This one this
[1:39:42] one and so they literally would name
[1:39:43] them and have nothing to do with them.
[1:39:46] Just stay with the ABCs. Live the life
[1:39:48] and get ready for the rapture. That was
[1:39:49] it.
[1:39:51] Obviously that was going to fail because
[1:39:53] what happens under that nature of cood
[1:39:57] stay with the ABCs live a holy life.
[1:39:59] What happens
[1:40:02] every person becomes a judge.
[1:40:06] That's what happens. You think you're
[1:40:08] living the life you then start becoming
[1:40:10] a judge that judges every single one in
[1:40:12] your own church. Right? And so I mean if
[1:40:15] you're preaching clothes line every
[1:40:17] service and after five years the clothes
[1:40:20] change now what do you do? You preach
[1:40:23] again and then it changes another five
[1:40:25] years. What do you do again and again?
[1:40:28] Right? They failed to notice this
[1:40:31] critical spirit rising within them and
[1:40:34] their people became judges. Uh and
[1:40:37] here's the other thing. They got to this
[1:40:39] place where they say only what the
[1:40:41] prophet said.
[1:40:43] Okay. Eventually they would individually
[1:40:46] believe that every one of them were the
[1:40:48] only ones saying what the prophet said.
[1:40:51] Even in their own churches,
[1:40:54] if another brother came and preached,
[1:40:56] the other ministering brother was
[1:40:57] waiting for them at the door to say
[1:40:59] that's not what the prophet said. So
[1:41:02] even in their own churches where they
[1:41:04] were disagreeing with other people for
[1:41:05] not saying what the prophet said, they
[1:41:07] started disagreeing with each other for
[1:41:09] not saying what the prophet said. The
[1:41:10] story of say what the prophet said
[1:41:12] became a real issue to them.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:17] Then churches became super legalistic
[1:41:19] holding their own members in prison of
[1:41:21] spirituality covering up scores of
[1:41:24] scandals
[1:41:25] of all kinds and that were uncovered
[1:41:28] later. They continue this way and many
[1:41:30] are still stuck today. By the turn of
[1:41:33] the 21st century, entering the 2000, the
[1:41:37] the thunders and Peruia doctrines that
[1:41:38] held dominance over the message for
[1:41:41] three decades began to spiral, lose
[1:41:44] control, and lose their appeal. People
[1:41:46] were not no longer interested in them.
[1:41:48] Independent churches were much stronger
[1:41:50] in larger numbers. Didn't need them.
[1:41:53] Didn't need to listen to them. Didn't
[1:41:54] need to pay attention to them. They
[1:41:56] started dying off. Right? the two sides.
[1:41:59] Uh doctrines began to explode into the
[1:42:01] pot like the coming of the Lord took
[1:42:03] place in 63. We just waiting for the
[1:42:06] translation or the rapture is over. It's
[1:42:08] time for the we're in the millennium or
[1:42:10] the two laws doctrine and smaller groups
[1:42:12] just started burst into right with the
[1:42:15] other two being suppressed. More splits
[1:42:18] occurred, more personality clashes
[1:42:20] between ministries. Uh you had other
[1:42:23] kinds of splits about maybe the mercy
[1:42:26] seat, the lamb leaving the mercy seat or
[1:42:28] mercy is over or the eighth day or the
[1:42:31] bride age or the appearing and the
[1:42:33] coming or the son of man ministry and
[1:42:36] the split split split splits. This is
[1:42:38] your history young people.
[1:42:43] Another important and and around about
[1:42:45] 2005 I would say and moving upwards
[1:42:48] another important
[1:42:50] uh thing occurred the defect from the
[1:42:55] message began to fight back on the
[1:42:58] internet and there became this obsession
[1:43:01] against brandism. We were three decades
[1:43:04] without people bothering about who we
[1:43:06] were. Now suddenly with the internet
[1:43:09] there were these people that were hurt
[1:43:10] in a church break away from the message
[1:43:13] go to the internet and make it their
[1:43:15] obsession their every waking obsession
[1:43:19] to slam William Brandon and to bring
[1:43:23] down every church and ministry they can.
[1:43:26] They didn't realize that by doing that
[1:43:28] they actually became brandites.
[1:43:31] Right? Another because you're obsessed
[1:43:33] with the man. Right? Another important
[1:43:36] reaction occurred then. So today now
[1:43:39] saints after what we saw in our history,
[1:43:41] it's flipping.
[1:43:43] It's like it's all flipping. What's
[1:43:46] happening is all those legalists
[1:43:49] who stayed with the intellectualism of
[1:43:51] the message have realized they were
[1:43:53] losing people and now they're trying to
[1:43:55] get radical.
[1:43:57] They are trying to resurrect gifts,
[1:43:59] sensations, emotions. and this other
[1:44:02] side which came from these thunders and
[1:44:04] and and emotional groups are trying to
[1:44:06] be more legalistic to get control of
[1:44:08] their people.
[1:44:11] This is what's happening. This is what
[1:44:12] we see.
[1:44:14] And so uh the the conservative legalists
[1:44:17] are trying to resurrect Holy Ghost
[1:44:18] meetings, sensations, shouting,
[1:44:21] fainting, falling, running, making a
[1:44:24] noise. And on the other side, they're
[1:44:26] becoming cold and formal. If you start
[1:44:27] listening to the thunders groups now,
[1:44:30] it's crazy. They're even sounding more
[1:44:32] intellectual than the other groups.
[1:44:37] And yet, brother says this. Let's read.
[1:44:38] Spoken word is we almost done. Spoken
[1:44:41] word is the original seed.
[1:44:44] I'm sorry this is long, but it has to be
[1:44:46] done.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; Then from a little group of the true
[1:44:49] seed of the word, God will present
[1:44:50] Christ, a beloved bride, a virgin, a
[1:44:53] virgin of his word. Do you see that?
[1:44:55] from a little group of the true seed of
[1:44:56] the word and a word of promise in
[1:44:59] himself like it was in Mary. He act
[1:45:00] himself uh uh by his own word of
[1:45:04] promise. So to fulfill all that has been
[1:45:06] written of him as he did when he come
[1:45:08] from the virgin womb type of the spirit
[1:45:10] womb now so will the virgin now accept
[1:45:13] his word but be it unto me as uh thou
[1:45:15] was said though it is said by an angel
[1:45:18] while it was written Isaiah 9:6 they
[1:45:20] will love him they will have his
[1:45:21] potentials for he is the head and they
[1:45:23] are his subjects subject to his word
[1:45:25] headship of Christ this is what is going
[1:45:28] to happen right now and is and has been
[1:45:31] happen from a little group of the
[1:45:33] seedword God will start working in
[1:45:35] there. Okay. So then a change starts
[1:45:38] taking place in the world in the message
[1:45:41] and uh becoming more personal. Somehow
[1:45:44] the word went from these camps to
[1:45:46] becoming more personal. Ministers
[1:45:48] started to apply the word to the
[1:45:50] personal lives of people and people
[1:45:53] started waking up. They started having a
[1:45:55] a a more intimate relationship with the
[1:45:58] word. It wasn't anymore about triple 6
[1:46:01] and William Brandham and and this and
[1:46:03] that. Now it's like how does this help
[1:46:05] me with my family? How does it help me
[1:46:07] with my job? How does it help me with
[1:46:08] with my work and applying it to my life?
[1:46:11] The seven seals to my life. That's what
[1:46:13] started happening. And mysteriously the
[1:46:15] word was being preached and people
[1:46:17] around the world being preaching the
[1:46:19] word becoming flesh in the bride. The
[1:46:21] God had been fulfilled with the bride.
[1:46:24] And perhaps maybe that was what is
[1:46:27] called or people are labeling as the
[1:46:30] bride coming movement. I'm just
[1:46:32] guessing.
[1:46:34] Right. So perhaps there are those who
[1:46:37] will preach in the you know that in the
[1:46:39] second coming the Lord Jesus he will
[1:46:41] come his body in the skies. Perhaps
[1:46:44] that's going too far. Perhaps there will
[1:46:46] be some who will take it too far and say
[1:46:48] that we are becoming him. I am Jesus.
[1:46:53] Maybe that's going a bit too far to say
[1:46:55] you are Jesus,
[1:46:57] right? Maybe you instead of saying
[1:46:59] Jesus, you should be saying Christ.
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Anointed vessel. See, if you say
[1:47:05] something like that that triggers
[1:47:06] somebody else, there's going to be push
[1:47:08] back at that. You understand? And those
[1:47:10] who will take another too far and say
[1:47:14] his literal body will be in the skies.
[1:47:16] Perhaps that's going to fall and
[1:47:17] hindering a complete revelation.
[1:47:19] Whatever it is, when it goes too far,
[1:47:22] God allows push back to straighten
[1:47:25] things out. Ultimately, from the
[1:47:27] beginning of the message till now, many
[1:47:30] opportunistic
[1:47:32] opportunistic men have been using the
[1:47:34] message of this humble prophet to amass
[1:47:36] riches and popularity to their name or
[1:47:40] their church's name. According to the
[1:47:42] prophet's warnings, churches have become
[1:47:44] lodges
[1:47:46] for religious message organization to be
[1:47:49] the very curse we swore not to be.
[1:47:53] Men begin to stray from the original
[1:47:55] truth, even claiming to be higher than
[1:47:57] the prophet.
[1:47:59] Many people sense this. Now, what are we
[1:48:02] leading you to the last one? Because of
[1:48:04] what men's ministries have been doing,
[1:48:07] we now get the push back to that which
[1:48:09] is press play and obey.
[1:48:14] Why? What is it telling you? Stop
[1:48:16] following a man. Get back to the voice.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; Right? You can say all you want against
[1:48:22] them, but why are you not saying what
[1:48:24] message ministers are doing with the
[1:48:27] message? to elevate themselves, to
[1:48:29] elevate what they say, to put themselves
[1:48:32] up above other people, to bring down
[1:48:34] other ministries. This is an exact
[1:48:37] reaction. Press, play, and obey is an
[1:48:40] exact reaction to other men making
[1:48:42] kingdoms for themselves.
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; And God has permitted it. So, here we
[1:48:48] are today in 2025.
[1:48:50] We're new believers and youth, you're
[1:48:52] finding yourselves here. You never knew
[1:48:54] all this. You never knew why. You are
[1:48:57] warned against things like this. And
[1:48:59] this generation that was born in the
[1:49:00] promised land, they do not, let me put
[1:49:03] it in this way, you don't even know what
[1:49:04] you're fighting for.
[1:49:07] Some of you don't even know there is
[1:49:08] even a fight,
[1:49:11] right? And uh take the time to
[1:49:13] understand, young people, and appreciate
[1:49:15] that you are here today because of the
[1:49:18] work of these great men. I call them
[1:49:21] great because I believe they were. They
[1:49:24] worked for the gospel. They brought it
[1:49:26] to where it is today. No matter what
[1:49:29] mistakes they made or how much troubles
[1:49:31] and trials they've been through, we are
[1:49:33] here today because of every last one of
[1:49:35] them.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. They did not realize how they were
[1:49:40] being used by the Holy Spirit to protect
[1:49:42] the seed from becoming a denomination.
[1:49:45] Maybe the reason why there had to be so
[1:49:47] much disagreements was so that we could
[1:49:49] never be a denomination.
[1:49:51] Maybe God was protecting it that way so
[1:49:53] it'll come to the end and then come to
[1:49:55] the unity of the faith.
[1:49:59] They all believed. If I think back when
[1:50:01] I was a child and teenager and speaking
[1:50:03] to many of these ministers because they
[1:50:06] would come to our home and I would have
[1:50:07] chats with them and every single one of
[1:50:10] them believed there needs to be unity.
[1:50:13] Not one of those brothers believed, nah,
[1:50:15] forget about those people. They all had
[1:50:17] this hungering in their heart for unity.
[1:50:21] And yet they just didn't know how. And
[1:50:23] many took the bait of the enemy and fell
[1:50:26] to popularity, money, so many, you know,
[1:50:29] good, strong, faithful people, but they
[1:50:32] believed, you know, right up till the
[1:50:33] very end, they believed there should be
[1:50:35] unity. Are you with me?
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; So, we may want to know what the
[1:50:40] doctrines are, and maybe for the wrong
[1:50:42] reasons. What I'm saying to you is now
[1:50:44] that I've explained all the doctrines,
[1:50:45] how it started, and the history, what
[1:50:47] are you going to do with it?
[1:50:49] Are you going to fight back at them? Are
[1:50:52] you going to use your knowledge of what
[1:50:53] they teach to fight back at them? There
[1:50:56] isn't a reason to do that. What What was
[1:50:59] it all really about? The seventh seal.
[1:51:02] What was the seven thunders and seven
[1:51:04] virtues about? Push back against former
[1:51:06] legalism, brandism, return ministry,
[1:51:09] stay with the ABCs. It was born from the
[1:51:11] desire to have a more personal and more
[1:51:14] enjoyable walk with God. Seven thunder
[1:51:17] virtues, right? Bring the dynamics, get
[1:51:20] the people lively again. What was Buua
[1:51:23] about? Push back against return ministry
[1:51:26] and outofcontrol liberal culturalism,
[1:51:29] charismatic moves in the seven thunders
[1:51:31] movement. When that thing went
[1:51:33] overboard, there was push back to write
[1:51:36] the boat. What was the seventh seal is
[1:51:39] not open and thunders not revealed
[1:51:41] about. push back against limiting the
[1:51:44] coming of the Lord to one day.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Because people were saying he came in
[1:51:50] February 28, 1963 coming is over. So the
[1:51:53] push back on that was no
[1:51:56] 70 is not open. We're still waiting for
[1:51:58] this and this and this. God permitted
[1:52:00] it. Why?
[1:52:02] What was the rapture is over and we are
[1:52:04] in the millennium. push back against not
[1:52:06] even seeing the rapture as a process
[1:52:10] taking place right now.
[1:52:12] What was two lords about? Push back
[1:52:15] against oneness godhead that most
[1:52:17] message people have which is rife in the
[1:52:20] message limiting the revelation of the
[1:52:22] seventh seal. Because if you only have a
[1:52:25] oneness conception of the godhead, how
[1:52:27] do you see you becoming God?
[1:52:32] How do you see the bride being God made
[1:52:35] flesh on earth? The two Lord system made
[1:52:38] way for the people to look past that
[1:52:41] push back against it because everyone is
[1:52:43] expecting a singular um movement in the
[1:52:47] coming of the Lord. Nobody sees the word
[1:52:49] coming made flesh in the bride, she
[1:52:51] becoming him, he becoming her, the two
[1:52:54] dimensions, heaven and earth embracing.
[1:52:58] What was the bride coming? push back
[1:53:00] against seeing the coming of the
[1:53:01] corporal body of Jesus and not seeing
[1:53:04] the word becoming flesh in the bride. So
[1:53:06] what is press play and obey? Push back
[1:53:09] against abuse of message ministers using
[1:53:12] the message to set up private kingdoms
[1:53:15] hurting people and not leading the Bible
[1:53:19] to the truth of this generation.
[1:53:22] God permitted it all. And they're all
[1:53:25] there for a reason. Just like in the
[1:53:28] first coming there were Pharisees,
[1:53:29] Sadducees, Essenes, diaspora, every last
[1:53:33] one of them, scribes. They were all
[1:53:35] necessary and they were all
[1:53:38] disciples of Christ.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; Individuals.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; So in closing,
[1:53:46] defining what you believe. So what do we
[1:53:48] do, brother L? What do we believe? What
[1:53:52] is our label? Oh, I hate that.
[1:53:56] What do we believe? Can you tell us what
[1:53:58] we believe? Don't you know what you
[1:54:00] believe?
[1:54:01] Right. The need I want to tell you this.
[1:54:04] The need to define your doctrine is a
[1:54:07] problem.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; The need to define your movement is a
[1:54:10] problem. You are not called to limit or
[1:54:13] define your belief to congregate around
[1:54:16] something. You must be able to hear the
[1:54:19] word and recognize truth.
[1:54:22] This is a there there is a gene seed in
[1:54:24] you. You must believe there is a gene
[1:54:25] seed in you that when it hears the
[1:54:27] truth, it will respond. You must be able
[1:54:30] to listen to a brother who's preaching
[1:54:31] seven thunder virtues and when when he
[1:54:34] says something that is true, say amen to
[1:54:36] it. And that which you don't respond to,
[1:54:38] let it go.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; You must be able to listen to a brother
[1:54:41] teaching Peruia and see the value in the
[1:54:43] Perua. And anything else that goes
[1:54:45] astray, you must be able to chop that
[1:54:46] away. You must be able to listen to a
[1:54:48] brother who's preaching the seventh seal
[1:54:50] is not open, live a holy life, and say
[1:54:52] yes to live a holy life.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; You must be able to put Netflix off and
[1:55:00] press play and obey.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; you are not meant to be caged by
[1:55:14] defending a doctrine. The book has been
[1:55:16] open to set you free. The bride is not a
[1:55:19] movement of a man or a church led by a
[1:55:21] group. It's individuals.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; That's what Malachi 4 said. So how do
[1:55:26] you know whether you are being limited?
[1:55:29] 1 Corinthians 1:12-15.
[1:55:32] This is right in the Bible. Now this I
[1:55:34] say that every one of you saith. I am of
[1:55:36] Paul and I am of Apollos. I am of Cphus
[1:55:39] and I of Christ. You mean it happened in
[1:55:42] Paul's day? Oh yes. The first church
[1:55:45] age, they were already split.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; I opposed. Paul says, "Is Christ
[1:55:51] divided?"
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, you're not even seeing this.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; One says, "I am of Paul." Last one, I am
[1:55:58] of Christ.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; One is literally, can you see it? That's
[1:56:03] what they did. We are with brother
[1:56:05] Brandham, not with brother so and so.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; They lit and Paul is asking, "Is Christ
[1:56:11] divided?"
[1:56:13] And then he says, "And was Paul
[1:56:15] crucified for you? Or were you baptized
[1:56:17] in the name of Paul?" Paul is actually
[1:56:19] expressing his his uh uh frustration. I
[1:56:23] thank God I baptized none of you except
[1:56:26] for Christmas and Gaes lest any should
[1:56:29] say that I baptized in my own name. And
[1:56:32] then he later says, "And oh yes, there
[1:56:33] was this other family that I baptized
[1:56:35] to. I'm glad I baptized none of you. So
[1:56:37] you can't have any claim to me."
[1:56:40] Look at that nature already there. Eye
[1:56:43] of Paul, eye of Christ.
[1:56:45] So this is it saints. If you are under a
[1:56:48] ministry, uh you you can see under the
[1:56:51] ministry of the first coming, right? How
[1:56:53] they were divided. If you are under a
[1:56:55] ministry that has defined itself and
[1:56:58] differentiated itself from others based
[1:57:00] on a brother's name, you're in trouble.
[1:57:04] Right? If you are under a ministry that
[1:57:07] defines itself to differentiate from
[1:57:09] others. If you are under a ministry that
[1:57:10] feels it needs to protect you and
[1:57:13] prevent you from fellowshipping with
[1:57:15] other others, it is a weak revelation
[1:57:17] that you have and it's controlling you
[1:57:19] by religion. A ministry that speaks the
[1:57:23] truth is not complex and does not need
[1:57:25] to use the pulpit to correct others by
[1:57:28] name or demonize and declare that others
[1:57:31] are are false based on their revelation
[1:57:34] of the word. You just preached the
[1:57:36] truth. We can warn you. I I would warn
[1:57:39] you against somebody who is unrighteous,
[1:57:41] immoral, and those with hidden agendas
[1:57:44] who want to circumvent the natural
[1:57:46] purpose of the church. But why do I need
[1:57:48] to stand here and prove seven thunders,
[1:57:50] seven virtues, false? I don't even want
[1:57:52] to waste my time telling you how the
[1:57:54] thunders is not the virtues. I'd rather
[1:57:57] spend time telling you what the thunders
[1:57:58] is.
[1:58:00] Why speak out against other people?
[1:58:03] Right? Colossians 2:18-23.
[1:58:07] This is we're closing with this. Are you
[1:58:10] listening?
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Grab it so I don't have to preach on it.
[1:58:14] Let no man begal you of your reward in
[1:58:18] voluntary humility and worshiping of
[1:58:20] angels. This is Paul the Pharisee
[1:58:22] speaking.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Who believed in angels.
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; Right. Let no man beguile you of your
[1:58:29] reward in voluntary humility.
[1:58:33] That means religion
[1:58:35] and worshiping of angel intruding into
[1:58:38] those things which he had not seen
[1:58:39] vainly puffed up in his fleshly mind and
[1:58:41] not holding the head the word from all
[1:58:44] the body joints bands giving nourishment
[1:58:46] ministered knit together verse 20
[1:58:48] wherefore if you be dead with Christ
[1:58:50] from the rudiments of the world why as
[1:58:53] though living in the world are you
[1:58:54] subject to ordinances it's telling you
[1:58:57] the bride of Christ does not need to be
[1:58:59] controlled by cood
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; by laws of the message. We don't need to
[1:59:04] be policed. We don't need to be
[1:59:05] constantly checked on. We don't need to
[1:59:08] be constantly corrected just because
[1:59:10] addressing changes here. Preach the
[1:59:13] word, man.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Preach the love of the gospel and watch
[1:59:17] the love of the gospel change them. You
[1:59:20] don't have to preach at them.
[1:59:23] What is he saying? Touch not, taste not,
[1:59:26] handle not. All these things which are
[1:59:29] all to perish with the using. If you're
[1:59:32] going to subject the bride to laws of
[1:59:35] religion, laws of righteousness, you
[1:59:38] will perish with it.
[1:59:41] Right? After the commandments and
[1:59:43] doctrines of men, last verse, which
[1:59:45] things, even all those things that tell
[1:59:46] you don't do this, don't do this, don't
[1:59:48] listen to that, don't watch that, don't
[1:59:49] go there, don't. They are things they
[1:59:52] have a indeed a show of wisdom in will
[1:59:56] worship
[1:59:59] right. What is will worship? Your own
[2:00:02] will works.
[2:00:04] They have a show of wisdom in works.
[2:00:07] They're only going to edify yourself.
[2:00:10] How? By trying to make you look holier
[2:00:13] than other people.
[2:00:15] By you becoming a master of rules and a
[2:00:17] master of abstinence. It's only going to
[2:00:20] show a show of wisdom in will worship
[2:00:22] and humility as in piousness. I'm a holy
[2:00:26] man. I don't do this. I don't do that.
[2:00:29] I'm like this. I come from the church.
[2:00:30] The I'm a holy man. Humility and
[2:00:33] neglecting of the body is abstinence. I
[2:00:36] don't eat this. I don't eat that. I
[2:00:37] don't go there. I don't dress like this.
[2:00:39] I don't not in any honor to the
[2:00:42] satisfying of the flesh. It's got no
[2:00:45] honor in it. It's only satisfying the
[2:00:47] flesh.
[2:00:49] The scripture tells us that. So what
[2:00:51] we're saying to you, the doctrine of the
[2:00:54] church, in closing, could not cause the
[2:00:57] church to become a or should not cause
[2:00:59] your church to become a police state.
[2:01:02] Faith does not take away your free will.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; If the church is taking away your free
[2:01:10] will, it is against God. If the doctrine
[2:01:13] you're following is taking away your
[2:01:14] free will, it is against God. If it is
[2:01:17] against God because every and it is
[2:01:19] against God because every member of the
[2:01:21] bride is a free agent.
[2:01:24] If the church is controlling you by fear
[2:01:26] of not making the rapture, keeping up
[2:01:28] with appearances of righteousness, then
[2:01:30] it is not living true and will fail on
[2:01:32] being natural and true to oneself. You
[2:01:35] will fail with marriages, will fail with
[2:01:37] relationships, you will fail with so
[2:01:39] many things. Why? Because you are
[2:01:42] operating on a legal basis.
[2:01:46] Having said all that,
[2:01:48] yeah, young people, as the church, we
[2:01:51] are not meant to sit back and just let
[2:01:53] you live liberal
[2:01:55] and live unrighteous and go off in the
[2:01:57] world and have filthy habits. We can't
[2:02:00] do that. I, you know, I deal with my my
[2:02:02] 8-year-old whenever he comes to me and
[2:02:04] he says, "Nah, why are you not letting
[2:02:06] me? You never let me do anything." I
[2:02:07] said, "Okay, okay. You want to do it?
[2:02:10] Okay. If you do it and you get it wrong,
[2:02:12] what should I do to you?
[2:02:14] tell me what punishment should you have
[2:02:18] and he usually goes for the max because
[2:02:20] he's so confident he won't do it wrong
[2:02:23] and then he goes and gets it wrong. So
[2:02:25] then I say according to you this is the
[2:02:27] punishment I must
[2:02:31] you see what I'm saying to you young
[2:02:33] people is when you get this idea that
[2:02:36] you can just handle yourself without
[2:02:38] getting into the word and you can just
[2:02:40] go live a holy a liberal life
[2:02:44] smudging yourself up with the world
[2:02:46] thinking you have strength and you'll
[2:02:47] never fail.
[2:02:50] This has already been tried.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; This has already been tried. We went
[2:02:55] there. We got the t-shirt and we burnt
[2:02:58] the t-shirt.
[2:03:00] It failed. Okay. Without the love of the
[2:03:03] word of God in you, you're not going to
[2:03:06] succeed. This is where we've got to come
[2:03:08] to.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. If it loves you, your doctrine,
[2:03:13] your church, if it loves you, your
[2:03:15] church will talk to you with dis with
[2:03:18] with with indiscretion, but with love,
[2:03:21] with wisdom, and with understanding and
[2:03:24] redeem you back to the foe. There is
[2:03:27] wisdom in maintaining order, young
[2:03:30] people, new people. To have a church
[2:03:33] that has good order, some rules, and not
[2:03:36] have chaos is good. It helps the word to
[2:03:39] be preached. It's not uh you know um
[2:03:44] uh having good decorum. It is just not
[2:03:47] the highest priority for us. Like we're
[2:03:50] if if if the b if a baby is slightly out
[2:03:53] of control, I'm not going to stand here
[2:03:54] and shout at the parent. If a if
[2:03:57] somebody is dressed slightly off today,
[2:03:59] I'm not going to spend my time focusing
[2:04:00] on that person.
[2:04:03] Uh it's not my priority
[2:04:06] to be causally correcting people.
[2:04:11] The word is our highest pri priority.
[2:04:13] Say brother, but that's the word to
[2:04:15] correct. No, that's not the word. You
[2:04:17] can do that in any organization in the
[2:04:19] world. Right? That's just common
[2:04:21] decency. That's common things that we
[2:04:23] can do. Strap up your life. Get
[2:04:26] straight. Be a little better person.
[2:04:27] That's not the word. That's not the word
[2:04:29] of this day.
[2:04:31] The word of this day is introducing you
[2:04:33] to the bridegroom
[2:04:35] to love him with all your heart, with
[2:04:37] all your soul. If the church is afraid
[2:04:39] to trust you, it means it is not
[2:04:42] preaching the book that is open in its
[2:04:44] fullness and it doesn't understand that
[2:04:46] God's sons do not need protection or
[2:04:49] policing.
[2:04:51] All right? So, I want to tell you
[2:04:53] saints,
[2:04:56] uh, I'm not here to act like I'm the
[2:05:00] greatest shepherd in the world that's
[2:05:01] going to protect you from the wolves.
[2:05:04] We've reached the stage where the role
[2:05:06] of shepherds is ending.
[2:05:10] Uh, it's now time that you stop being
[2:05:13] bleeding sheep that are always victims
[2:05:16] and falling off cliffs. I mean, how long
[2:05:19] has the path been tread? You keep
[2:05:21] straying off and falling off cliffs.
[2:05:24] The path is so available. There are even
[2:05:26] signs there telling you there's the
[2:05:28] path.
[2:05:31] No, it's the shepherd's fault. You
[2:05:34] should have put more signs.
[2:05:36] You know, maybe build fences along the
[2:05:38] cliff edge. It's his fault. What is your
[2:05:41] problem for not staying on the path?
[2:05:43] Stop making excuses.
[2:05:47] &gt;&gt; This is where we are today. And I'm
[2:05:49] going to trust you.
[2:05:51] even to fall off the cliff and climb
[2:05:53] back up.
[2:05:56] I'm not going to catch you every single
[2:05:58] time. Sometimes you can only learn by
[2:06:01] banging your head because then you won't
[2:06:03] do it again. I'll be there to pray for
[2:06:06] you. I'll be there to counsel you and
[2:06:08] bring you back and help you have some
[2:06:11] restitution and whatever it is, but I'm
[2:06:14] not going to pull you along and tell you
[2:06:16] that I'm going to get you into heaven by
[2:06:18] my strength. Not going to happen.
[2:06:20] You have to be the bride of Christ. And
[2:06:22] so when we look at all these doctrines
[2:06:24] in the message, this is what it's been
[2:06:26] about. It's been the wisdom of God
[2:06:29] through all this time leading us up to
[2:06:31] where we are now ready as an individual
[2:06:34] to be married to the word of God.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can now look at it for
[2:06:38] yourself. You have enough word in you to
[2:06:40] say, I can't subscribe to that doctrine.
[2:06:42] I can't subscribe. I don't know that. I
[2:06:44] don't believe that. I don't believe
[2:06:45] that. Imagine that you are that person.
[2:06:48] Now, you can actually look at something
[2:06:50] and say, "I don't believe in that. This
[2:06:52] is my amen. This is what I stand on.
[2:06:55] This is who my bridegroom is, and this
[2:06:58] is where where I make my stand." That
[2:06:59] that's you right now. And should
[2:07:02] churches close down and fail, you will
[2:07:04] still have that strength in you. You
[2:07:06] will not be tossed to and fro by every
[2:07:08] wind of doctrine. Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you. Let's bow our heads
[2:07:13] together.
