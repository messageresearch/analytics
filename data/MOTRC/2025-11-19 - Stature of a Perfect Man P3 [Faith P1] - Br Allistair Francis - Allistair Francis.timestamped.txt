[0:02] We're going to read, if you can just get
[0:04] the slide for me. We're going to read
[0:06] from Ezra chapter 3
[0:09] verse 10-13.
[0:11] Hope you can see that. Ezra 3 10-13.
[0:17] And when the builders laid the
[0:19] foundation of the temple of the Lord,
[0:22] they set the priests in their apparel
[0:25] with trumpets and the Levites, the sons
[0:28] of Asaf, with symbols to praise the Lord
[0:31] after the ordinance of David, king of
[0:33] Israel. So bear in mind what's happening
[0:35] here, right? The builders have laid the
[0:38] foundation of the temple. This is after
[0:41] the um uh captivity that the children of
[0:45] Israel were taken in. They've been sent
[0:47] back, allowed back to come and build up
[0:49] the temple. And so they've laid the
[0:51] foundation. Now watch this. All they've
[0:53] done is laid the foundation. Right?
[0:55] Verse 11. And they sang together by
[0:58] course in praising and giving thanks
[1:01] unto the Lord. That means it was it was
[1:03] like worship in course meaning one part
[1:06] of this and one part of that. It must
[1:07] have been prayer. There must have been
[1:08] singing. And giving thanks unto the Lord
[1:11] because he is good for his mercy.
[1:13] Because he is good. for his mercy
[1:15] endured forever toward Israel. And all
[1:17] the people shouted with a great shout
[1:20] when they praised the Lord because the
[1:22] foundation of the house was laid of of
[1:25] the house of the Lord was laid. But many
[1:28] of the priests and Levites and chief of
[1:30] the fathers who were ancient men that
[1:33] had seen the first house when the
[1:35] foundation of this house was laid before
[1:37] their eyes wept with a loud voice. That
[1:41] means those people who had been there in
[1:44] the captivity, they saw the previous the
[1:47] first temple and then it was destroyed.
[1:49] Now when they just had seen the
[1:51] foundation laid again, they just cried.
[1:55] Amen. And many shouted aloud for joy. So
[2:00] that the people could not discern the
[2:02] noise of the shout of joy from the noise
[2:05] of the weeping of the people. For the
[2:07] people shouted with a loud shout, and
[2:09] the noise was heard a far off. So the
[2:12] people couldn't even tell. There was so
[2:14] much of weeping and crying and shouting
[2:17] and noise and all they did was lay the
[2:20] foundation. Amen. The Lord bless the
[2:22] reading of the word. You may be seated.
[2:26] So
[2:28] So this is the stature of a perfect man
[2:31] part three. Yeah. Statue of a perfect
[2:34] man part three. So, we're back in our
[2:36] series and uh thankful to the Lord um we
[2:40] can have this um uh subject that we can
[2:44] speak on. It's a really wonderful
[2:45] subject, statue of a perfect man. And
[2:48] we're on to faith part one. So, we're
[2:50] right at the bottom of the pyramid and
[2:52] we're going to show you the diagram in a
[2:54] little bit. And our title this morning,
[2:57] the perfect foundation and the destroyer
[3:00] of doubt. Amen. So now if we go to the
[3:04] diagram
[3:06] and uh you can see this is the the
[3:08] standard diagram that all message
[3:11] believers understand is the church ages
[3:15] and the f the seven church ages with you
[3:18] can see it on the left there with
[3:20] Ephesus, Mona, Pergamus, Thite, Tyrus,
[3:22] Philadelphia, Lee on this side are all
[3:24] the messengers and then in the center is
[3:27] written the virtues that we're looking
[3:29] at that is mentioned add to your faith
[3:31] virtue add to virtue, knowledge,
[3:33] temperance and so on until you reach
[3:35] brotherly kindness in the seventh and
[3:37] then the Holy Ghost cements the capstone
[3:41] which is love down upon a perfected
[3:44] church. So that's the that's the theory
[3:46] kind of given right and then we looked
[3:48] at this and we understand that every
[3:51] child of God goes through something goes
[3:54] through exactly the same every one of us
[3:56] you could not uh receive the capstone
[4:00] revelation of Christ having only started
[4:04] off at the bottom. Right? So but what we
[4:08] want to show you is the importance of
[4:10] these virtues and how beautiful it is in
[4:13] our growth. At the same time, you know,
[4:16] I don't I wouldn't want a believer to
[4:19] think he can jump from number one to
[4:22] number eight. Why would you want to do
[4:25] that? I mean, you would want to enjoy
[4:27] the journey, right? So, it's like saying
[4:31] um making your 2-year-old toddler start
[4:35] work,
[4:37] right? He doesn't have the ability. He
[4:40] doesn't have the functionality.
[4:42] And he doesn't even have the desire to
[4:45] start work to go to work and earn a
[4:47] living. He's only two. He's got to
[4:50] really enjoy his growth and his
[4:51] schooling. And he's got to come to the
[4:53] stage where it's going to come to him to
[4:55] say, I need a job. Right? So this
[5:00] scripture that we have read
[5:03] describes the laying down of the
[5:06] foundation. So you can go to the next
[5:07] line. This is what we're speaking of is
[5:10] the that faith is the foundation. So if
[5:14] you looked at that diagram, the
[5:16] foundation of the building is at the
[5:18] bottom, right? So and the amazing thing
[5:22] is when you start off with the
[5:24] foundation after the building is built,
[5:26] nobody sees the foundation.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Nobody even recognizes it. Nobody knows
[5:31] it. But the foundation is holding
[5:33] everything up. cuz without the
[5:35] foundation everything collapses. Right?
[5:38] So this scripture that we read in Ezra
[5:41] chapter 3 describes the laying down of
[5:44] the foundation of the temple of Solomon
[5:46] in Jerusalem after they were taken into
[5:48] captivity from Babylon. And this laying
[5:51] down of this foundation for I would say
[5:54] an earthly house like a church or a an
[5:58] earthly building, right, brought such a
[6:01] great anointing and atmosphere that the
[6:04] people praised and worshiped and shouted
[6:07] and wept and all they had was a
[6:10] foundation.
[6:12] All the emotion was at its height. The
[6:15] Levites and the elders of the tribes who
[6:17] were old and remembered the first temple
[6:20] wept so loud that from afar people could
[6:24] not tell the difference between the
[6:26] weeping and the shouting. And people
[6:29] from afar were wondering what is going
[6:31] on. You know these people are shouting,
[6:34] they're rejoicing. They couldn't even
[6:35] tell the difference.
[6:37] In other words, there was a real a
[6:41] genuine reaction response to just the
[6:45] foundation being built.
[6:49] That that is amazing. So also when God
[6:52] began. So the reason why I'm telling you
[6:54] that is now look in the beginning of the
[6:57] church when the foundation was being
[6:59] built in Christ and the apostles that
[7:03] was the time of emotions and shout and
[7:06] and tongues and prophecies and the
[7:09] greatest noise that you could ever have
[7:12] right and it was filled with all kinds
[7:15] of things till the people who witnessed
[7:17] it when they came out of the upper room
[7:20] they were confused
[7:21] &gt;&gt; like what is this right? Those who
[7:24] witnessed it and and some people thought
[7:26] these people were drunk and and what
[7:28] were they they were rejoicing and they
[7:32] were filled with the spirit only at the
[7:35] foundation.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; These people hadn't even received the
[7:38] capstone ministry. These people do not
[7:40] even know the seven seals. They don't
[7:42] know the thunders. They don't know the
[7:43] trumpets. They have the book of
[7:45] revelation has not even been written
[7:47] yet.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And these people are shouting and
[7:50] and filled with emotion and joy and and
[7:54] u because all they had was the
[7:57] foundation was the Messiah has come. He
[8:00] died for our sin. He rose again. That's
[8:02] the foundation of our faith.
[8:06] And yet the house had not been built.
[8:09] The church is in its infancy. There in
[8:12] fact there is no church yet. They just
[8:14] came out of the upper room and
[8:16] everything is built on the foundation of
[8:19] these men and women.
[8:23] So when the church ages began, God had
[8:26] begun to rebuild his house, right? And
[8:30] we know that Christ was the chief
[8:33] cornerstone. So that's what where we
[8:34] want to start now. We want to go to 1
[8:36] Peter uh 2:5-6.
[8:41] And it says, "You also as lively,"
[8:44] meaning living, meaning expressing,
[8:46] manifesting stones, are built up a
[8:49] spiritual house and a holy priesthood to
[8:52] offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable
[8:55] to God by Jesus Christ. Do you agree?
[8:58] The scripture says you are supposed to
[8:59] be a house,
[9:01] &gt;&gt; you the believers, the spiritual house.
[9:04] This building is not the church. It's
[9:06] the people that is the church. Church
[9:09] means called out ones,
[9:12] &gt;&gt; right? So the church has always been the
[9:15] body of people, not the building. Right?
[9:18] In fact, the people are the building.
[9:21] &gt;&gt; You are the lively stones. So you agree,
[9:24] right? And then verse six tells us
[9:28] that wherefore also it is contained in
[9:30] the scripture that is in the Old
[9:32] Testament. Behold I lay in Zion a chief
[9:36] cornerstone elect precious and he that
[9:40] believeth on him shall not be
[9:42] confounded.
[9:44] So in the Bible
[9:46] chief cornerstone means chief foundation
[9:50] stone. So just to explain that to you in
[9:53] the really old days when you would build
[9:56] a house uh somebody who's building a
[9:59] large structure they would dig down into
[10:00] the earth and they would find a rock
[10:02] that is immovable. It can't be moved.
[10:05] It's solid rock underground and they
[10:07] would start the foundation there. They
[10:08] would dig into that rock. That's the
[10:10] cornerstone. That would be the
[10:12] foundation. So you'd actually look for
[10:14] this place on your land where this
[10:16] you've hit rock underneath. And you know
[10:19] that's where you want the starting of
[10:20] your foundation because should there be
[10:23] storms, should there be water, should
[10:25] there be anything that would cause this
[10:27] house to move, you know it's anchored on
[10:29] that rock. That's the chief cornerstone.
[10:32] So, so also in times past when they were
[10:36] building churches because of that people
[10:39] had this tradition of building a
[10:41] triangular or L-shaped stone which they
[10:44] called the cornerstone and they place
[10:46] that literally like if this church was a
[10:48] rectangular building. You would choose
[10:50] the highest portion depending on the
[10:52] land and you would place your L-shaped
[10:55] stone in that corner because that's
[10:57] going to hold the building. You got it
[10:59] right. So the scripture is saying Christ
[11:03] is our chief cornerstone. I lay in Zion
[11:06] a chief cornerstone. In other words, a
[11:09] foundation stone. Now if you if you
[11:11] don't believe that, the next verse is
[11:14] going to tell us that, right? Uh but um
[11:18] elect precious he that believeth on him
[11:20] shall not be confounded. We'll come to
[11:22] that. So in his first coming what this
[11:26] is saying to us is the first coming he
[11:30] was the cornerstone.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; The apostles then were attached to him.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; He was the foundational belief.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; He was the beginning of the Christian
[11:40] church.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; Though Jesus himself was not a
[11:44] Christian,
[11:47] &gt;&gt; he was a Jew. And the first few people
[11:50] that came after him were not Christians.
[11:52] They were still Jews. They were only
[11:54] called Christians by the Romans to
[11:56] identify them. So in actual fact, when
[11:58] Christ started the church, they were not
[12:00] called anything.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; It wasn't called Christianity. It wasn't
[12:04] even that's the way we were meant to be.
[12:06] We're not meant to be some movement that
[12:09] is defined by men. We supposed to be
[12:11] faith,
[12:13] &gt;&gt; the faith of Jesus Christ. That's what
[12:15] it should be.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[12:18] So
[12:19] uh he was then the foundation of the new
[12:22] house, the new temple. In fact, in the
[12:25] scripture, it doesn't even say that um
[12:28] he desired for us to build a Christian
[12:31] church, build chapels, build
[12:33] foundations, build other, you know, I
[12:35] mean political foundations and religious
[12:37] foundations. He doesn't say that. If and
[12:40] and this what I believe we're coming
[12:42] back to. Everything in the world is
[12:44] breaking down. Churches are failing.
[12:46] religious movements are failing because
[12:48] you've got to come back to it. I asked
[12:50] the question of our church last week in
[12:52] Durban.
[12:54] Uh is this what Christianity has become?
[12:59] Can we really go back when we meet the
[13:02] foundation stone and say we're built
[13:05] upon the pattern you started?
[13:09] Can any movement of Christianity today
[13:13] say that their building fits the
[13:16] foundation?
[13:20] Right? Who? Why? Who's the foundation?
[13:22] This humble man who was crucified for
[13:26] the sins of others, who never enriched
[13:29] himself with his wisdom and his word,
[13:32] who didn't go across trying to get
[13:35] everyone politically to love him and
[13:37] agree with him. He told the truth. He
[13:40] did not stand for sin. He challenged the
[13:42] beliefs of the leaders of that day. And
[13:45] he went to the poor and the needy. Can
[13:48] Christianity today say they are
[13:50] absolutely built on that foundation?
[13:53] This is a this is a good question. This
[13:55] is why everything's failing today.
[13:57] Right? So I believe that in the end time
[14:01] as well the bride forms part of the
[14:04] capstone as well a part of the second
[14:08] coming. Now the thing about and that's
[14:10] what we'll get to when we get to love
[14:12] the capstone is the capstone is also an
[14:15] angular stone. It's the only stone that
[14:18] does not fit the rest of the building.
[14:20] So an angular stone is the chief
[14:22] cornerstone first coming and another
[14:25] angular stone is the capstone second
[14:26] coming that completes everything
[14:29] &gt;&gt; right that's why there are two
[14:31] comingings of Christ
[14:33] let's go to Ephesians chapter 2 19
[14:37] so here's this the next scripture we're
[14:39] speaking of now therefore you are no
[14:42] more strangers and for foreigners but
[14:44] fellow citizens with the saints and of
[14:46] the household of God and are built upon
[14:50] the foundation of the apostles and the
[14:53] prophets. So, do you agree? The
[14:55] scripture is saying you are now the
[14:57] church of the living God and you are
[14:58] built upon the foundation.
[15:01] It's telling you there's a foundation.
[15:03] What's the foundation? The foundation is
[15:05] made up of the apostles and prophets.
[15:08] And then it says Jesus Christ himself
[15:11] being the chief cornerstone.
[15:14] &gt;&gt; So, the scriptures now told us what
[15:16] Zechariah was saying. Behold, I lay in
[15:17] Zion um a shore foundation or chief
[15:20] cornerstone and so on. Uh we read that
[15:23] in first Peter which is spoken of in
[15:24] Zechariah.
[15:26] But you can see here that Paul is
[15:29] identifying that the foundation of the
[15:31] church is the apostles
[15:34] &gt;&gt; and the prophets and Jesus Christ
[15:36] himself being the chief cornerstone,
[15:40] &gt;&gt; the shore foundation. Are you with us?
[15:42] So Paul is acknowledging the foundation
[15:44] of the apostles. He acknowledges Christ
[15:47] as the chief cornerstone. But he says we
[15:50] are built upon the foundation. So
[15:54] therefore, we've got to understand what
[15:56] the apostles doctrine was really about.
[15:59] That's the foundation. Now, a lot of
[16:01] people will will also look at it and
[16:03] they'll say, "Well, if the foundation
[16:05] was tongues, prophecies, uh, healings,
[16:11] um, and and what happened in Acts
[16:13] chapter 2, then we've got to keep that
[16:16] going all the way through the building,
[16:18] right? That's the foundation. That's
[16:21] what's being built upon, right? When you
[16:25] build the rest of the building, the rest
[16:27] of the building does not look like the
[16:29] foundation at all.
[16:32] &gt;&gt; Nothing here looks like the foundation.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; It's completely different, but it's
[16:37] anchored on that.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what we're going to
[16:41] get into today. So, what then really is
[16:45] it? Is it really the was the foundation
[16:48] of the apostles and Christ? Was it
[16:50] really tongues, prophecies, and
[16:52] healings?
[16:53] No, it wasn't. It's actually something
[16:56] else. Tongues prophecies and healings
[16:59] could be if we describe it in building
[17:01] would be like the um uh substance, the
[17:05] mortar, the water a little bit in there.
[17:08] The spirit mixing with cement mixing
[17:11] with stones that would be like
[17:13] prophecies and so on and so on. But what
[17:15] is it really? What is the true
[17:17] foundation? It is faith.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; That's the foundation.
[17:24] So a lot of people say, you know, we've
[17:26] got to patent ourselves after the
[17:28] foundation. The apostles doctrine is
[17:30] signs, wonders, healings, prophecies,
[17:32] tongues, this and that. No, it's faith.
[17:36] The original faith. Amen. That is the
[17:40] belief. And what the apostles introduced
[17:43] only one thing to the world, faith in
[17:46] the Lord Jesus Christ. They didn't go
[17:48] around saying
[17:50] believe in our tongues. believe in our
[17:52] prophecies.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; They said, "Believe in him, Christ
[17:56] Jesus, who died for your sin and rose
[18:00] again and is ascended into glory. Have
[18:02] faith in that.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; Repent, be baptized, have faith in that,
[18:06] and you shall receive the gift of the
[18:08] Holy Ghost. And the signs shall follow
[18:10] them that believe, not the other way
[18:14] around. You've got to believe first.
[18:17] You've got to have faith first and the
[18:19] signs will follow those that believe.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; There it is. So the faith manifested by
[18:26] the miracles and the the the miracles
[18:28] were the manifestation of the faith that
[18:31] already existed. Amen. So the belief in
[18:34] Jesus Christ as the Messiah, his death,
[18:37] burial, that was called the gospel or
[18:39] the good news. Go into all the world and
[18:41] tell them the gospel. the good news that
[18:44] he died and rose again for our sin. Is
[18:47] that right?
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, let's get to the purpose of
[18:51] the foundation.
[18:53] So, anyone who knows anything about
[18:56] building, we'll come to the scripture in
[18:57] a little while. Anyone who knows
[18:59] anything about building knows that you
[19:02] cannot construct a building properly
[19:05] without a solid foundation.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Right? Even if you had to build a house
[19:10] out of sticks like the second little
[19:12] pig,
[19:14] right? You still got to dig holes like
[19:18] maybe four holes in the ground and sink
[19:20] a large pole and put in cement in there
[19:23] to make the solid structure. Like if any
[19:26] of you have built a backyard wooden shed
[19:29] in the ground, you know that's what
[19:30] you've got to do. There has to be a
[19:32] foundation and the foundation is the
[19:36] strength of the house. Cuz if you don't
[19:38] have a solid foundation, the house falls
[19:40] down. Literally falls down. And so the
[19:43] foundation, the stronger the foundation,
[19:46] you know, if you if you come to the city
[19:48] like Durban or even worse, Johannesburg
[19:51] where you've got these buildings that
[19:52] are like 50 stories high, you know, can
[19:55] you imagine what that foundation must
[19:57] look like to hold that thing up in the
[20:00] sky,
[20:02] right? You you have got to spend they've
[20:04] got to spend months probably years
[20:07] planning the foundation based on what
[20:10] they want to put above ground. And that
[20:12] foundation has to be solid. It has to be
[20:15] dried. It's got to be tested. It's got
[20:18] to be uh tested by all the science
[20:21] forensics people you can think of.
[20:23] Before you put one thing up, it cannot
[20:26] be compromised. It's got to be checked
[20:28] for fractures, for cracks, for all that
[20:31] before you put up a building. So Christ
[20:34] himself when he spoke about this
[20:36] foundation that he was building, he was
[20:39] very proper about this. He didn't um he
[20:43] didn't compromise it with a show of
[20:46] faith.
[20:47] &gt;&gt; It had to be real faith.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So he once gave a parable. You
[20:53] remember remember the parable of the
[20:56] wise and the foolish man. The wise man
[20:59] built his house upon a rock. The rock
[21:01] meaning a solid foundation. And the
[21:04] foolish man built his house upon the
[21:06] sand. And when the rains came down means
[21:08] the trials of life.
[21:11] The one who built his house on a rock,
[21:13] his house remained. So, which actually
[21:15] tells you when you're a Christian
[21:19] and your life is falling apart, you
[21:22] falling into all kinds of u
[21:25] backslidedness,
[21:26] it's your foundation that is a problem,
[21:32] right? This is easy to diagnose. What is
[21:34] your foundation? So, obviously, he was
[21:37] referring to the spiritual house that
[21:39] each man builds. Now watch that word
[21:42] rock.
[21:44] Rock symbolizes
[21:47] revelation.
[21:49] Right? So again, I'm I'm going to
[21:52] reiterate this because a lot of
[21:53] Christians don't get this.
[21:57] Rock has always been revelation,
[22:00] not signs, wonders, tongues, prophecies,
[22:03] healings, altar calls, shouting,
[22:05] screaming, all that. The shouting,
[22:07] screaming comes after the foundation is
[22:09] built. Amen.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; According to the book of Ezra, when the
[22:13] foundation is built, then come the
[22:15] emotions. But what is the rock? It's
[22:18] always been revelation. So now let's go
[22:21] to Matthew 16:16 to18. And everybody
[22:24] knows this. And Simon Peter answered and
[22:27] said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of
[22:28] the living God." So what is this? Jesus
[22:31] asked the the disciples, "Who do men say
[22:34] that I am?" And some said, "You are
[22:37] Isaiah the prophet." Some say you are
[22:38] Elias. Some say you are this. Some say
[22:40] you're a holy man. Some say you are a
[22:42] prophet. Who do you say that I am? And
[22:45] Peter answered, "Thou art the Christ,
[22:48] the son of the living God." Now hold
[22:50] that thought. Do you know how many
[22:52] people I think every single Christian
[22:55] believes this? Oh, Jesus Christ is the
[22:58] son of God. That's our our faith. He is
[23:02] the son of God.
[23:04] They still don't know what it means
[23:07] because they took son of God and said he
[23:09] is second person in the trinity. There
[23:12] is the father and then there is the son.
[23:15] They still don't know. Their faith,
[23:19] their foundation is fractured.
[23:24] How do we know? So Jesus said unto him,
[23:27] blessed art thou Simon Barjonah for
[23:29] flesh and blood. Are you listening?
[23:32] flesh and blood had not revealed this to
[23:33] you. This is not something your church
[23:36] came up with. This is not the theology
[23:38] you learned in Bible school. This is not
[23:40] the construction of the Trinity. Flesh
[23:42] and blood cannot reveal this to you. I'm
[23:45] challenging every one of you here. Your
[23:48] faith has to be not something that man
[23:50] has taught you.
[23:52] &gt;&gt; The spirit of God must have revealed
[23:55] this to you. You can only build upon
[23:58] that.
[24:00] And I said, uh, um, but but my father
[24:03] which is in heaven, it's got to come
[24:04] from God himself. And I say unto thee,
[24:06] verse 18, that thou art Peter, his name
[24:10] was Simon Barjonah, Simon's son of
[24:13] Jonas. And Christ said, you will now be
[24:16] named Peter. And upon this rock I will
[24:20] build my church upon what rock?
[24:23] So the Catholics said, "Peter, because
[24:26] he named Peter means a stone, a little
[24:27] stone.
[24:29] Right? So the Catholic Church says
[24:32] Christ built the church on Peter. That's
[24:34] why Peter was the first pope. It's
[24:36] nonsense. That's not the rock. The rock
[24:40] is the foundation.
[24:42] The rock is thou art the Christ, the son
[24:44] of the living God.
[24:47] Upon that rock, in other words, Christ
[24:49] is telling you the revelation that I am
[24:53] the Christ,
[24:55] the son of the living God. That's the
[24:58] foundation I will build my church on.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; That's the foundation. Are you all
[25:03] together? So if you're a Christian
[25:05] today, that's your starting point. Do
[25:08] you believe that he is the Christ, the
[25:11] son of the living God? Everyone will
[25:12] say, "Yes, amen. I believe that." What
[25:15] do you mean by that? That's what's
[25:17] important. What does it mean that Christ
[25:21] is the son of the living God? So a lot
[25:23] of Christians today
[25:26] uh this has been lost to them and that's
[25:29] why they are no longer a part of the
[25:32] building. This is the reason all
[25:35] Christian denominations are no longer a
[25:37] part of the building.
[25:39] They they're they're living under an
[25:41] illusion that they're a part of the
[25:43] building. They're not. They've been
[25:45] excommunicated.
[25:46] They have excommunicated themselves from
[25:49] the foundation
[25:51] &gt;&gt; because they took him and made him a
[25:53] second person in the trinity.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; They lost they they don't even know
[26:00] what it means that he is Christ the son
[26:02] of the living God.
[26:05] That's why they compromise on the word.
[26:09] So if you don't know what Christ the son
[26:11] of the living God means, you will never
[26:14] understand the second coming. and the
[26:16] capstone. If your foundation is wrong,
[26:19] you can never come to the capstone and
[26:21] see that you must be Christ, the son of
[26:23] the living God.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; If that's the foundation, how then are
[26:27] you Christ in the end? If you don't, if
[26:29] you see him as the second person of the
[26:30] Trinity, you will never accept that you
[26:33] can be Christ, the son of the living
[26:34] God.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; That's the whole purpose why this is
[26:38] what a believer must grow up into.
[26:41] Right? So, I want to put you into the
[26:44] picture.
[26:46] If he came and said, "I am Christ, the
[26:48] son of the living God. I'm a second
[26:49] person in the Trinity. Uh, the Father is
[26:53] God, and I am I am his emissary. I am
[26:56] his ambassador sent to you." They
[26:58] wouldn't have crucified him. They said,
[27:00] "Oh, okay. You're just like any other
[27:01] prophet." Then you're like a holy man
[27:04] who's come to draw us back to God and
[27:05] bring us to repentance. We're okay with
[27:07] that. That's not why they crucified him
[27:10] because they understood what Christ, the
[27:12] son of the living God, means. Amen.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; They said to him, "You being a man, make
[27:18] yourself God."
[27:20] The Jews understood what this phrase
[27:23] means. After 2,000 years, it's lost to
[27:25] the to people of the world because
[27:28] you're not Jewish. You don't understand
[27:29] that phrase that that that um that that
[27:33] those words. You don't understand what
[27:35] it means to be son of God.
[27:40] You you being a man make your they
[27:43] understood perfectly what that meant.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'll just say it. You
[27:50] are saying you are God.
[27:52] &gt;&gt; We have a problem with that.
[27:54] &gt;&gt; And why do they have a problem with
[27:55] that? They knew the Messiah was going to
[27:58] come. They knew the Messiah was going to
[27:59] be a man. They knew that God was going
[28:02] to become a man. It was prophesied of.
[28:05] They knew that. They couldn't accept the
[28:08] way he came.
[28:10] &gt;&gt; They thought he would come like the way
[28:12] he came to through Abraham.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; The fact that he came through Mary who
[28:17] was an unknown of the tribe of Judah
[28:20] where there was a scandal. She was
[28:22] espoused to her husband. There were no
[28:24] details in Isaiah that said it's going
[28:26] to be like that.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Then when he comes, he does everything
[28:30] completely different to them. They
[28:32] couldn't accept this humanity that he
[28:34] looked like a normal person. He had no
[28:37] glowing aura. He had no halos or angels.
[28:42] He didn't walk around destroying the
[28:44] Romans and bringing earthquakes and
[28:46] plagues and and and condemning the
[28:48] sinful. He didn't do that. He didn't
[28:50] come and elevate the righteous, holy
[28:53] people that went to church every day.
[28:56] There was something wrong with their
[28:58] understanding of what son of God meant.
[29:02] But they crucified him for that. Right?
[29:06] So they understood him loud and clear as
[29:08] should any Christian today not get lost
[29:12] in theology. What I'm saying to you, I'm
[29:14] going to I'm going to tell you your
[29:16] foundation is this. Jesus Christ was
[29:20] God.
[29:22] &gt;&gt; That's your faith. That's where you
[29:25] start. If you don't have that, you can't
[29:27] build on it. Jesus Christ was God. God
[29:31] came from being a spirit and was made
[29:33] flesh in that man.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; He became a man so he could die cuz no
[29:38] other person could die for our sin. No
[29:41] other man was worthy to take the book.
[29:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; If God did himself did not become man to
[29:47] take the sin upon himself, there's no
[29:50] way we could pay back for our sin.
[29:53] So the phrase which is the rock of the
[29:56] foundation of the church is simply this.
[29:59] Jesus Christ was God incarnate in a
[30:02] human body created by God himself and
[30:06] born through a virgin woman. That's your
[30:08] foundation.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; That's your cornerstone.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; From there you build the rest. Now you
[30:14] can bring in how the church must come
[30:16] in. Water baptisms. uh godhead um um
[30:21] speaking in tongues, prophecies, dreams,
[30:23] visions, healings, altar calls, all that
[30:26] kind of you can bring in all that. But
[30:28] where do you start? What's your faith?
[30:31] That Jesus Christ is God. That is the
[30:35] foundation that the church is built
[30:36] upon. A lot of people miss this. So I
[30:39] want to bring it. So you saw Matthew
[30:40] chapter 16 verse 16 to 18. Thou art the
[30:44] Christ, the son of the living God. So
[30:45] that's the Gospel of Matthew
[30:48] hearing what Peter said and recording
[30:51] that.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Now let's see how Luke records the very
[30:55] same interaction.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; Luke records the same thing and says
[30:59] something completely different.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, but whom say you
[31:04] that I am? Now Luke is saying Peter
[31:06] answering said the Christ of God.
[31:12] He does. Now Luke doesn't record him
[31:15] saying you are the Christ, the son of
[31:17] the living God.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Because Christianity today gets hooked
[31:20] on the word son. Luke said that Peter
[31:23] said, "Thou art the Christ of God."
[31:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:27] &gt;&gt; He There's no mention of son here.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; It's the same interaction, same event.
[31:33] &gt;&gt; Two different men watching the scene
[31:36] recorded differently, but the same
[31:39] revelation. What does the Christ of God
[31:42] mean? Christ is the anointed, manifested
[31:46] flesh vessel.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; God incarnate,
[31:52] &gt;&gt; and he strictly charged them, tell no
[31:55] man that thing.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Don't go around telling people. It's got
[31:59] to be a revelation to them. It's got to
[32:02] be a foundation of faith.
[32:05] Amen.
[32:07] You agree? Luke doesn't say son of God.
[32:10] He said Peter's answer was Christ of
[32:12] God. Praise be to his name. So then
[32:17] message people fall into this trap too,
[32:20] right? Because Luke doesn't say son of
[32:22] God. He says Christ of God. That tells
[32:25] you son of God is equal to Christ of
[32:29] God. Cuz you've got these two different
[32:31] accounts. Now you have to decide what
[32:34] your foundation is in this context. So
[32:38] why do message people fall into a trap?
[32:41] Because we are living in the days of the
[32:43] capstone age, the second coming. And why
[32:48] are they not accepting what the seven
[32:50] seal actually means? Why are they not
[32:53] accepting that you are supposed to be
[32:56] the purpose of all redemption is to make
[32:58] you the Christ of God.
[33:00] &gt;&gt; Why can they not accept that? Because
[33:03] they have not accepted the proper
[33:05] foundation in the first place.
[33:09] So they are rejecting what the headstone
[33:12] is revealed under the seventh seal.
[33:16] So what if you had to tell them that
[33:18] today under the capstone age and you say
[33:21] to them we are the Christ of God.
[33:24] It's going to be like oh really so now
[33:26] we must worship you.
[33:29] That's not what we're saying at all.
[33:31] Nobody's saying that. But we totally
[33:33] understand what Christ of God means. God
[33:36] made flesh.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; In this day,
[33:42] &gt;&gt; in this day, he came the first time to
[33:44] take sin upon him to die on the cross.
[33:47] This time, he's he's come he comes
[33:49] without sin. In other words, he's not
[33:52] going to die again.
[33:54] &gt;&gt; He does not have to we don't have to be
[33:56] crucified again. This is a different
[33:59] kind of coming.
[34:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:02] So spiritually we can understand that
[34:06] the first step of the gospel is to
[34:08] cement your soul in the faith of Christ.
[34:12] This means the first thing you need as a
[34:14] Christian to do is to make sure that you
[34:18] wholly believe. You must settle it in
[34:20] your soul. Jesus Christ is God. He died
[34:23] for my sin. You first have to realize
[34:26] I'm a sinner.
[34:28] I have faults. I have problems. And I
[34:31] cannot change my own ways. There's no
[34:34] way for me to change my own ways and his
[34:37] death. And this is the thing. How do we
[34:39] know that? Because if you know, if you
[34:43] have experienced the faith of Christ
[34:46] being God, you know, you're the only
[34:49] witness that your life has been changed.
[34:52] Nothing else can change you.
[34:54] I've seen people struggle with drinking,
[34:57] smoking, drugs, all that kind of
[34:59] addiction.
[35:01] Uh there's a lot of people who talk
[35:03] about going cold turkey, you know, just
[35:05] give it up all in all up in one day and
[35:08] they know it just doesn't. But the
[35:11] amount of people we know who are changed
[35:15] in one day because they have accepted
[35:17] the faith, nobody goes back to it. And
[35:21] then you have people who say once's an
[35:23] alcoholic always an alcoholic right
[35:25] which means afterward the smell affects
[35:28] them the thoughts the memories when
[35:30] you're someone who comes to the faith
[35:32] and accepts the salvation of Christ
[35:35] thereafter the smell makes you hate it
[35:39] like I I speak to some people you know
[35:40] who used to be smokers and you you think
[35:43] like when I mean smokers I mean like
[35:46] real chain smokers and then they they
[35:48] they come and they are saved
[35:50] They are completely changes. Talk about
[35:52] cold turkey. It's done. It's finished.
[35:54] It's it's over. Thereafter, they are the
[35:56] most intolerant people to others who are
[35:58] smoking like like the hatred of it. They
[36:01] can't stand it. We are actually who
[36:04] never smoked are actually more
[36:06] accommodating to people who are smokers.
[36:09] No, these guys who used to be chain
[36:11] smokers and who have been delivered.
[36:14] They the taste of it has gone from them.
[36:20] That's what I'm talking about. That's a
[36:22] change.
[36:24] Not a psychological
[36:26] uh movement that kind of you know go
[36:30] through these steps of getting rid of
[36:32] it. No, doesn't happen like that. God
[36:36] literally BUT IF YOUR FAITH is not real,
[36:39] if it's cracked, you cannot make true
[36:43] repentance.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; So you have to start there right
[36:47] now. So if you don't get that right, you
[36:51] cannot even begin to understand the
[36:54] deeper things of God, if you first
[36:57] cannot believe the truth. So if you
[36:59] don't know for sure in your heart that
[37:02] he is God, he is the Christ of God, how
[37:06] are you going to understand the seven
[37:08] church ages, the trumpets, the vials? if
[37:12] and we're going to we're going to get to
[37:14] this in the second half of the service
[37:17] to tell you what it means when you
[37:19] actually believe that. So the other
[37:21] thing is they'll people will say okay I
[37:25] can accept that I can believe that. No
[37:28] what you what you've done is convince
[37:30] yourself that it's something you need to
[37:31] accept. That's knowledge. That's
[37:34] reasoning. That's not believing.
[37:38] You it's got to be believed right? So if
[37:42] you can't begin by believing it, you
[37:45] will not believe other things. And
[37:47] you'll see how simple this is. Every
[37:50] Christian has to believe this. This is
[37:53] our foundation which many people have
[37:55] taken for granted. This is our
[37:57] foundation upon which we can be made
[37:59] strong. Upon which the church can be
[38:01] made strong. If a believer or a church
[38:04] is not cemented in this foundation, then
[38:07] it will be easy to be led astray by all
[38:10] winds of doctrine.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Wrong doctrine.
[38:16] Amen. So Paul who is now you all agree
[38:19] Paul is the messenger to the first
[38:21] church age right?
[38:23] &gt;&gt; So he is part of the foundation of the
[38:25] church.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; Paul is part of the foundation and Paul
[38:30] warned us of this. Let's read. Let's go
[38:32] to 1 Corinthians 3 10-11.
[38:38] Amen. According to the grace of God
[38:40] which is given unto me as a wise master
[38:43] builder I have laid the foundation. I
[38:46] Paul have laid the foundation. Paul is
[38:49] calling himself a master builder. You
[38:51] agree?
[38:52] &gt;&gt; I love that the beginning the the first
[38:55] messenger is saying I'm a master builder
[38:57] and I have laid the foundation. So
[39:00] there's a lot of people who think Paul
[39:01] is not part of the foundation. He's he's
[39:04] telling us I have laid the foundation
[39:07] and another buildth thereon. But let
[39:10] every man take heed how he buildeth
[39:13] thereon. This is where we're coming to.
[39:16] For other foundation can no man lay than
[39:19] that is laid. So you can't go back and
[39:22] assume you have laid you can lay another
[39:24] foundation after the foundation is laid
[39:27] which is Jesus Christ. [snorts] Are we
[39:29] together?
[39:31] Let's go to Galatians 1:8.
[39:34] And then he says, "But though we or an
[39:36] angel from heaven preach any other
[39:38] gospel uh unto you than that which you
[39:41] have we have preached unto you, let him
[39:43] be accursed. As we said before, so say
[39:46] I." Now again, if any man preach any
[39:49] other gospel unto you than that you have
[39:51] received, let him be accursed. Got it?
[39:54] So what are we talking about? The
[39:56] foundation.
[39:58] So because he's built the foundation,
[40:00] he's saying no man can come and rebuild
[40:03] that foundation.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; Any man who comes after has to build on
[40:07] top of that
[40:08] &gt;&gt; because the foundation has been built
[40:10] from Christ. You can't lay another one.
[40:13] You can't come and claim you know Christ
[40:15] in a different way. We are the we are
[40:18] the the master builders of the
[40:19] foundation. We've started it. We are the
[40:22] witnesses. We saw him. We saw the
[40:25] purifier. He spoke to us. We are the
[40:28] beginners of this. You can't come and
[40:29] allow another man to restart this.
[40:33] Which is what the the Catholics did.
[40:35] Came and started with Mary olive tree an
[40:37] immaculate conception of Mary.
[40:40] This was Mary is not the foundation.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; She's not the Christ of God.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; You cannot build a foundation with her
[40:50] in it.
[40:53] See, marriolology does not exist in the
[40:56] foundation.
[40:58] There's no part of it where you can
[41:00] because if you do, then you're going to
[41:02] go to, you know, Mother Teresa and all
[41:05] these other people and now you've got
[41:06] these other factions of things coming
[41:08] through and it just does not fit with
[41:10] the with the building. Are you with me?
[41:13] So Paul refers to the plan. He says that
[41:17] all that they have done is according to
[41:19] the plan and it is right. If any man
[41:22] tries to deviate from that plan, let him
[41:26] be accursed.
[41:28] Right? This didn't mean that there if
[41:31] another man came and he said something
[41:32] different, there is a curse upon him.
[41:35] Right? This meant that the man must be
[41:38] put out from among us. In other words,
[41:40] being treated like something that is
[41:42] accursed, meaning something that we
[41:45] cannot agree with, we must separate
[41:47] ourselves from him. You got it? He must
[41:51] be treated like the thing. Like for
[41:54] example, in that in those days, eating
[41:56] pork was the thing. Eating unclean meat
[41:59] was the thing. That didn't mean you um
[42:04] um every pig that you saw, you had to
[42:06] kill it. It served its place in society.
[42:10] Is this right? Amen.
[42:13] I am amazed at the hypocrisy of people
[42:16] who callously use the scripture to brand
[42:20] other people saying just because they
[42:23] preach differently from us, they are a
[42:26] perverse thing or that they are, you
[42:30] know, something that needs to be uh
[42:33] spoken against and demonized and called
[42:35] all sorts of stuff, right? All kinds of
[42:38] horrible language. The entire New
[42:41] Testament is clear about the mystery of
[42:44] Christ as the foundation. You agree?
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] Now, but who really has perverted the
[42:52] foundation?
[42:54] Who and why don't they accept if um
[42:58] these ministers who speak out against
[43:01] people preaching what the capstone is
[43:03] today? Why can they not see what the
[43:06] capstone is?
[43:08] Why? because they have perverted the
[43:09] foundation.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. You agree?
[43:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, here's something you need to
[43:20] ask yourself
[43:23] in your life as a Christian. Have you
[43:26] ever asked yourself, "What is the real
[43:28] gospel of Christ?"
[43:32] What is the real gospel of Jesus Christ?
[43:36] Mhm. Because that's where you've got to
[43:38] start.
[43:41] We come into church and we we say, you
[43:43] know, I'll choose this church as my
[43:44] fellowship and this looks like a nice
[43:46] place to be. And that's how people
[43:48] choose churches today. I like the music.
[43:50] I like the building. I like the people
[43:53] that's how you find that's how you find
[43:55] a church. And then you settle down and
[43:57] think, "This is a nice place. I like how
[43:58] the people dress here. I like how they
[44:00] handle the Sunday school. It looks like
[44:03] they can teach my kids nicely, you know.
[44:06] That's not how you choose a church.
[44:10] Does that church have the firm
[44:12] foundation? Is it built upon the right
[44:15] foundation? Because if it's not built
[44:17] upon the right foundation, you cannot
[44:20] build upon it according to the word.
[44:24] &gt;&gt; You will compromise the building.
[44:28] Now the foundation was a fiercely
[44:32] protected thing. That's why. Are you
[44:35] listening to me? I'm I'm going to make
[44:38] this as clear as day. These people died
[44:42] for it.
[44:45] They gave their lives for it.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; They were crucified upside down. They
[44:50] were beheaded.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; They were torn aunder.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; They were quartered.
[44:56] They were willing to die for this
[44:58] foundation.
[45:02] They spoke out unhindered. They would
[45:05] they would come into the marketplaces of
[45:07] cities and towns and speak the
[45:10] foundation and get arrested and thrown
[45:12] in prison and die there.
[45:18] You wouldn't find these people today
[45:20] walk into Christian churches and say, "I
[45:22] choose this church for my family. I'll
[45:24] settle down here. I'll do this." Will
[45:26] you die for it?
[45:29] YOU WOULDN'T DIE FOR IT. This is how
[45:31] these people began THE FOUNDATION.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; THEY DIED FOR IT.
[45:38] &gt;&gt; For people, Christians today, one thing
[45:41] said that rubs you up the wrong way.
[45:43] You're you're ready to quit. You're
[45:46] ready to leave. That already tells me
[45:48] your foundation was not right. You never
[45:51] even hit the the the rock, the bedrock.
[45:55] You were not even anchored. If you're
[45:57] just so easily willing to quit over
[46:00] whatever it is, some silly man's words
[46:03] or something that offended you,
[46:06] your foundation was wrong. Because if
[46:09] your foundation is right, you're willing
[46:11] to set your life on it.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let's talk about our
[46:17] foundation.
[46:19] Right? They anchored this foundation so
[46:21] strong that it wasn't difficult to add
[46:24] us to the building.
[46:26] Amen. Those who in themselves if you
[46:30] match the foundation you can easily be
[46:32] added to the building. Right? So let me
[46:36] give you an example. Let's say the
[46:38] foundation of let's say you have a
[46:39] rectangular church right? The the walls
[46:41] are straight. Okay. And your your
[46:44] foundation is built perfect perfect
[46:46] line.
[46:48] Can you go and put like a a circular
[46:51] rock
[46:53] on top of that and build other little
[46:55] bricks? Can you go and put a a a piece
[46:58] of rock that looks like an like an
[47:00] octagon or a hexagon or a star- shaped
[47:03] rock or some other kind of weird rock
[47:07] and think you can build other rocks on
[47:09] top of it? No, you can't. It's got to
[47:11] match the foundation.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Let's read a message handwriting on the
[47:17] wall.
[47:19] said, someone said to me a a time some
[47:21] time ago said, "Preacher, our foundation
[47:23] of America was founded upon the
[47:25] reverence and the respects of our
[47:27] forefathers. They were religious men.
[47:30] Therefore, God will protect this nation
[47:32] forever."
[47:34] Brother says, "He will have no more
[47:37] respect for us than he did for Israel.
[47:41] ISRAEL WAS CALLED AND CHOSEN PEOPLE, and
[47:44] when they sowed, they reaped what they
[47:46] sowed." And that goes for individuals.
[47:49] No matter how holy or church we claim to
[47:52] belong to or how good we try to live,
[47:55] God is obligated to his word to judge us
[47:58] according to what he said. Our
[48:00] foundation is not our church. Our
[48:03] foundation is not William Brandom. Our
[48:05] foundation is on the word for your day.
[48:09] Our our foundation is not our church.
[48:12] It's not our teachings or even the
[48:14] message of this day. The message of this
[48:17] DAY IS BUILT UPON THE FOUNDATION.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Our foundation is not our traditions.
[48:23] Our foundation is not water baptisms,
[48:26] godhead, serpent seed. Our foundations
[48:29] is not communion or gathering of the
[48:32] people. Our foundation should and always
[48:36] be the mystery of Christ. Anything
[48:41] that is built upon that foundation
[48:45] must match the foundation.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; See what is the perfect foundation
[48:50] saints? Faith.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; The right faith.
[48:55] Let's go to proof of his resurrection.
[48:57] The next quote paragraph 65.
[49:00] Now you can't do it in your old mind.
[49:02] You can't do it. It's you're like trying
[49:05] to put paper on a building or paint it
[49:08] up when the conditions are too bad when
[49:11] the foundation is condemned. If the
[49:14] government condemns a house, the
[49:15] foundations is rotten. How can you build
[49:18] upon that house? You're only building
[49:20] for a fall. No matter how much you paint
[49:23] the inside, how good you paper it up, so
[49:26] wallpaper it up, all the cracks, right?
[49:29] How many shingles you put over the top
[49:31] of it, how many shrines you raise, how
[49:33] many crucifixes or crosses you put
[49:35] everywhere, it's going to fall. THE
[49:39] FOUNDATION IS WRONG. The foundation is
[49:41] rotten. And man in his mental way of
[49:45] thinking is wrong to begin with.
[49:49] So I, you know, apart from reading
[49:52] quotes and scriptures, let's just say it
[49:54] plainly.
[49:56] When you come into this world and you
[49:58] will go looking for God, you're already
[50:01] looking for the wrong thing. You don't
[50:03] know what to look for. Your idea of God
[50:06] is already rotten. If you try to live a
[50:10] righteous life, you know, I grew up in
[50:13] this town. I grew up with
[50:17] young people of all sorts of faith.
[50:19] Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Christians,
[50:23] Pentecostals, Catholics. I grew up with
[50:25] them all.
[50:26] I've watched them try to to be
[50:28] righteous. I watched them. I I I played
[50:31] cricket with them. I played sport with
[50:33] them. I did speeches with them. I went
[50:35] to all the functions our schools had. I
[50:38] watched those young people try to be
[50:41] good people.
[50:43] That without foundation you cannot.
[50:47] I I've watched this. We all we all had
[50:49] the same start, right? As young people.
[50:52] I went to Esiva Primary School. We were
[50:54] all little children. We did stupid
[50:56] things. We were corrected by the
[50:58] principal. We uh we all learned you are
[51:02] a boy, you are a girl. At first, I'm
[51:05] just telling you how you grew up. And at
[51:07] first, when you see these primary school
[51:08] kids, the boys don't want to play with
[51:10] the go. I don't want to play with you.
[51:11] You're a girl. I don't want to play.
[51:13] You're a boy. Boy, sit there. Girls, sit
[51:15] there. And you saw this. Nobody taught
[51:17] them that. They just kind of figured
[51:19] this out, right? And then as they get to
[51:21] like 12 years old, now suddenly they're
[51:23] starting to have crushes on each other.
[51:25] Now they the boys want to be with the
[51:26] girls. The girls want to be with the
[51:28] boys, right? Things are changing. And
[51:30] then they get to to 12, well 13 when we
[51:33] were here. Now nowadays it's in primary
[51:35] school. They want to swear when they
[51:36] seven. They want to use horrible words.
[51:38] Back then we didn't want to swear. We
[51:41] just started the boys started learning
[51:43] slang and so on. My point is you got
[51:45] innocent children of all races and
[51:48] religions. All of them trying to be
[51:51] good. Teachers are trying to make them
[51:53] be good. Don't do this. Don't do this.
[51:55] Do your work on time. Uh do your
[51:57] homework. Speak with correct manners.
[52:00] Remember in uh I don't know some of you
[52:02] ever went to Esiv Primary School when I
[52:04] was uh silence is golden. Manners maketh
[52:08] the man. you know reading all those
[52:11] things they taught us today you got all
[52:15] these children who come up they don't
[52:16] even read a single book
[52:19] they don't even they don't even believe
[52:21] in silence that silence is golden like
[52:23] shut up and listen then you learn
[52:25] something no before you even finish the
[52:28] sentence they're interrupting you
[52:29] because they want to tell you their
[52:31] truth
[52:32] that's where we are today
[52:35] again coming back to my point no matter
[52:37] what your foundation is if it's not
[52:40] built on a solid rock, you are going to
[52:43] get to high school and you're going to
[52:45] want to desire immediately as a boy. I
[52:49] got to try to smoke.
[52:52] I got to try to tr it. I want to I want
[52:55] to swear when the teacher turns his
[52:57] back, I want to swear him. And my
[52:58] friends think, "Oh, he's so cool. He
[53:01] swore the teacher, the worst teacher,
[53:03] the math teacher. He showed him a thing
[53:04] or two." What makes a child who started
[53:08] off innocent
[53:10] start to come to a place where he
[53:12] desires to be unh wholesome,
[53:16] ugly,
[53:18] foul-mouthed,
[53:19] errant, criminal in his thinking,
[53:22] wanting to steal FROM EACH OTHER,
[53:24] WANTING TO STEAL each other's
[53:25] girlfriends and boyfriends. YOU'RE NOT
[53:27] EVEN AN ADULT yet and you're already
[53:29] stepping into a realm of of being evil,
[53:33] BEING UGLY, BEING BAD, being
[53:36] foul-mouthed.
[53:39] Why? Because and and I saw them of every
[53:43] religion, none of them could achieve it.
[53:47] All of them, oh, it's okay. This is how
[53:49] we are. This is what we do. Let's cheat.
[53:52] Let's lie. Let's swear. Let's curse.
[53:54] Let's do every wrong thing in the book.
[53:57] If you have the right foundation, you
[54:00] will not tend in that direction.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; There's no way you can argue that point
[54:05] with me. I've lived this life and I've
[54:07] seen it.
[54:09] If we don't start right on the right
[54:12] foundation correctly, you cannot build a
[54:15] roof
[54:17] when the foundation is compromised.
[54:20] You cannot put the roof on, stand
[54:22] outside. That's what he's saying. You
[54:23] can paint up. You can put all the
[54:24] crosses. You can put the cloud picture.
[54:26] You can put Hoffman's head. You can do
[54:28] all these things, all furnishings and
[54:31] everything. If your foundation is not
[54:33] the right kind of faith, you are going
[54:35] to come out in the end and say, "This
[54:37] message is false. William Brand is a
[54:40] false prophet. I'm leaving. I'm
[54:42] quitting. I blame you, my parents. You
[54:44] made me live an awful life. You did this
[54:46] to me. You did that to me." Why? Your
[54:48] foundation has never even been Christ.
[54:51] Don't even lie to us.
[54:55] Because there really is nothing wrong
[54:56] with what the prophet tells you.
[54:59] What is wrong about telling you smoking
[55:02] is wrong, drinking is wrong, adultery is
[55:03] wrong, fornication is wrong? What's
[55:05] wrong with that? What's wrong with
[55:07] telling you to dress right, to speak
[55:08] properly? There's nothing wrong with
[55:10] that. The truth is something inside of
[55:13] you doesn't want to live right because
[55:15] you haven't even hit the foundation.
[55:21] You cannot try to work this up. And I
[55:23] want to tell you, don't think you can go
[55:25] to all these youth camps, message camps,
[55:28] whatever it is, and have a feeling, have
[55:30] an altar call and stand there and shout
[55:32] and scream and and feel like the spirit
[55:34] came on you. And from there, you that's
[55:36] not even your foundation. That must come
[55:39] after the foundation has been built,
[55:45] &gt;&gt; right? That is part of the foundation
[55:47] now. Jesus dying for your sin, rising
[55:50] again, resurrecting and ascending.
[55:53] Their foundation, they had to believe he
[55:56] was the Christ before he died.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; When Peter said, "Thou art the Christ,
[56:04] the son of the living God." This was
[56:05] before he died and rose again. Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; So if he was uh let's think of it this
[56:13] way. Dying for your sin, resurrecting
[56:15] and ascending was built upon the most
[56:20] important thing. Dying, resurrecting,
[56:23] and ascending is not even the
[56:25] foundation. That was built upon the
[56:28] foundation.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; What was the foundation? Thou art the
[56:31] Christ of God.
[56:33] Let's say he was just a holy man.
[56:37] Are you listening? Let's say he was just
[56:39] another holy man who lived right, did
[56:42] all the the things the church and the
[56:44] scriptures tell us, and then he died and
[56:47] rose again. It means nothing.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Lazarus died and rose again.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Our foundation is not built on Lazarus.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? The foundation is THAT
[57:03] HE IS THE CHRIST of God.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Everything else is built on that.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; If he was just a holy man like some of
[57:14] them believed, it's not going to cut it.
[57:16] Let's go to Ephesians 2:8. For by grace
[57:19] are you saved through faith, and that
[57:21] not of yourselves. It is the gift of
[57:23] God, not of works, lest any man should
[57:26] boast. So the main thing about the
[57:27] understanding of the foundation is that
[57:29] it was laid to be built on. Nobody lays
[57:32] a foundation and then walks away and
[57:34] say, "Yeah, great. Let's have a party.
[57:36] We have a foundation." You can't live on
[57:38] the foundation.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; The foundation is not going to shelter
[57:42] you.
[57:44] &gt;&gt; The foundation is not going to keep the
[57:45] storms away from you.
[57:48] The foundation needs to be built upon.
[57:51] This is why the church people who speak
[57:54] apostolic doctrine and this and that and
[57:56] you got to bring it back to this and
[57:58] that. No, that has to be built upon. The
[58:01] foundation is not enough to complete
[58:04] you.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; The joy of the foundation like the old
[58:10] temple will not last like those people.
[58:14] What would have been the point in Ezra
[58:16] chapter 3 if they built the foundation
[58:18] and stopped and said and they were
[58:20] shouting, screaming, crying, weeping,
[58:23] having a religious time so that the
[58:25] noise went to far distances that people
[58:28] could hear what was going on. What would
[58:30] be the point if they came back every
[58:32] single day and did the same service over
[58:34] just the foundation?
[58:37] No point. Why? Because it's not going to
[58:40] keep.
[58:42] You can't live on only a foundation.
[58:46] Matthew 14:29-31
[58:49] says he said come. And when Peter was
[58:52] come down out of the ship, he walked on
[58:54] the water to go to Jesus. And when he
[58:56] saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid
[58:58] and begin to sink. And he cried, saying,
[58:59] Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus
[59:01] stretched forth his hand and caught him
[59:03] and said unto him, Oh thou of little
[59:05] faith,
[59:07] wherefore dst thou doubt?
[59:10] Are we together?
[59:14] So we are coming to a very important
[59:16] part of our faith. There is nothing else
[59:19] that can be the foundation of the temple
[59:21] of God. My point is knowledge cannot be
[59:26] a foundation.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Love cannot be a foundation.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness, not even virtue.
[59:36] Yes.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Listen, a holy life lived according to
[59:40] the standards of the message cannot be a
[59:43] firm foundation.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; It will fail you.
[59:49] There is nothing else that can be a
[59:51] foundation for a perfect man.
[59:56] It has to be faith. Right? Now, we need
[59:59] to find that. So, there are basically
[1:00:02] five senses of the body, right? See,
[1:00:05] smell, taste, hear, touch. Agreed?
[1:00:09] Basically five senses. And then there
[1:00:11] are five basic senses of the spirit. But
[1:00:14] there are only two senses in the soul,
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; right? And that's either faith or doubt.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; So you you can have only one of the two.
[1:00:28] If in or let me say it this way, you
[1:00:31] should have only one of the two which is
[1:00:33] faith.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; The soul was made for faith.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Right? So that's where we we're coming
[1:00:39] to the second half of our teaching.
[1:00:42] Notice Jesus question, right? Uh
[1:00:46] uh
[1:00:49] Jesus question concerning faith or
[1:00:51] doubt. Uh how does this faith work then?
[1:00:57] Right? Do you doubt because you have
[1:00:59] little faith? Because he said, "Oh thou
[1:01:01] of little faith, wherefore did thou
[1:01:04] doubt?"
[1:01:06] So his question is, "Why did you doubt?"
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; What was the reason for you having
[1:01:12] doubt? You saw me? Don't you believe in
[1:01:14] me? Why did you doubt? So how does this
[1:01:18] work? Right? Do you doubt because you
[1:01:21] have little faith or do you have little
[1:01:23] faith because you doubt?
[1:01:27] Are you understanding my question? All
[1:01:29] right. So, we are going to do this
[1:01:32] through the entire teaching till we
[1:01:34] reach the top. We're going to take many
[1:01:37] months to get through this, right?
[1:01:40] But the basic understanding is the
[1:01:43] growth of a child to manhood.
[1:01:48] From infancy to manhood, from infancy to
[1:01:51] maturity. Are you with me? Now when a
[1:01:55] baby is born
[1:01:57] there is zero doubt in him.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Zero doubt. Okay. He has no doubt in him
[1:02:07] whatsoever. He only has faith
[1:02:11] and he has zero ability.
[1:02:15] He cannot walk. He cannot crawl. He
[1:02:18] cannot feed himself.
[1:02:21] He cannot roll over. He cannot pick his
[1:02:23] head up. He has zero doubt and zero
[1:02:27] ability. Can you imagine being that kind
[1:02:29] of person? That's how you start it off.
[1:02:33] Zero doubt, zero ability. Okay. So, the
[1:02:37] first thing if you know a baby, the
[1:02:39] first thing in his development now
[1:02:42] obviously
[1:02:43] it would be wrong if a baby came out of
[1:02:45] the womb and started running around
[1:02:47] everywhere
[1:02:48] doing everything, GRABBING THIS,
[1:02:50] GRABBING. CAN YOU imagine just being
[1:02:52] born in the first day, jump off the
[1:02:53] hospital bed, run around talking to the
[1:02:56] doctors, the nurses, teasing them,
[1:02:58] stealing stuff, running? That would be
[1:03:00] crazy that you look at this and think
[1:03:02] this thing is possessed. Put it back.
[1:03:06] Right? That's wrong. You just can't do
[1:03:09] that. The baby is born with zero doubt,
[1:03:13] zero ability. Now, uh, for and then the
[1:03:18] first thing when he develops them. Okay.
[1:03:20] So let me give you a little bit of
[1:03:22] science. So the baby starts to drink
[1:03:25] milk from the mother. Within the first
[1:03:28] week, it has to rise in weight by half a
[1:03:32] kg, 500 g. Agreed? If you go to clinics,
[1:03:36] you go every every sort of 7 days and
[1:03:39] you weigh the baby. They check the
[1:03:40] height, they check all the parameters,
[1:03:43] all whatever it is, and the the weight
[1:03:45] and they checking that the baby is
[1:03:47] literally gaining half a kg every week.
[1:03:50] That's a healthy baby.
[1:03:52] Why? What is happening? Whatever he's
[1:03:55] drinking is starting to give him
[1:03:57] ability.
[1:03:58] Within the first 3 weeks, you see him
[1:04:00] start to lift his neck.
[1:04:03] Like you can leave him on his back. When
[1:04:05] they're born, you leave them on their
[1:04:06] back, they can't move. They're so zero
[1:04:09] inability. They can die from their head
[1:04:12] being stuck in a in a mattress and they
[1:04:14] can't breathe. So that's why you got to
[1:04:17] take care of them. And then they start
[1:04:19] getting ability to lift the neck because
[1:04:22] the food they're taking in is giving
[1:04:25] strength to the muscles
[1:04:28] which is the next step we come to is
[1:04:30] virtue which is ability.
[1:04:34] You'll see it right now. Let's move on.
[1:04:37] So this baby all he has is when he opens
[1:04:41] his eyes the doctors know this because
[1:04:43] this is scientific as well. put the baby
[1:04:45] in the mother's arms and the child has
[1:04:47] to lock eyes with the baby. I mean the
[1:04:50] the the child has to lock eyes with the
[1:04:51] mother. The mother lock eyes with the
[1:04:53] baby. Immediately the child recognizes
[1:04:55] the mother immediately faith.
[1:04:59] This is mom. He doesn't even know what's
[1:05:01] mom. He doesn't know mother. He doesn't
[1:05:02] know English. He doesn't know Zulu or
[1:05:04] any language. He just locks eyes and
[1:05:06] knows this is you. I know you. I believe
[1:05:11] in you. And a smile opens up.
[1:05:16] Like the baby doesn't look at mom and
[1:05:18] you if if you ever witness it, it's the
[1:05:20] most amazing thing. The baby opens his
[1:05:22] eyes like struggling to open his eyes
[1:05:24] like this. And when he locks eyes with
[1:05:25] mom, you just see this smile,
[1:05:29] this alien looking smile,
[1:05:32] right? Squashed up face like a prune and
[1:05:35] then smile and then this gurgle like
[1:05:38] it's so beautiful to watch, right? But
[1:05:42] um uh at that moment there's only faith.
[1:05:47] There's no doubt. This child is not
[1:05:49] going to open its eyes and and go,
[1:05:50] "Whoa, WHO ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING
[1:05:53] HERE?"
[1:05:55] There's no doubt. There's no reason to
[1:05:56] question. This child knows. I know you.
[1:06:01] You're taking care of me. You're the one
[1:06:03] I believe in. That's how it begins. It's
[1:06:06] faith.
[1:06:09] And what does he do from there? He got
[1:06:11] no speech. He can't talk. He can't
[1:06:14] articulate. He just says
[1:06:19] mom says, "Okay, he needs food." The
[1:06:21] next time he goes, and then mom says,
[1:06:24] "He's nappy. Needs to be changed." He
[1:06:27] just cry. He just cries and things get
[1:06:29] done for him.
[1:06:32] That's faith.
[1:06:34] Zero ability, zero doubt. Just cry out
[1:06:37] to your heavenly father and things get
[1:06:39] done
[1:06:41] because he knows you're weak.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; You have no ability. All you're going to
[1:06:45] have is faith, right? And then at first
[1:06:50] when the little infants, everybody
[1:06:52] carries them. Is that right? The uncle,
[1:06:54] the aunt comes home, can I carry him?
[1:06:56] Can I feed him? And yeah, he doesn't
[1:06:58] care. They stand, they hold him, they
[1:07:00] give him a bottle, they feed him, they
[1:07:01] change his nappy. He's letting them do
[1:07:03] everything. No problem.
[1:07:06] Within a few months, his eyes have
[1:07:09] recognized your mom, your dad. You I
[1:07:13] don't know. You I don't know. You smell
[1:07:15] funny. You smell funnier. You I don't
[1:07:18] like. What is that? That's knowledge
[1:07:20] coming in. Right? He started to
[1:07:22] recognize things. He started to
[1:07:24] recognize people. He knows his room. He
[1:07:27] knows the smells. That's And the moment
[1:07:30] knowledge starts coming in is when doubt
[1:07:33] starts coming in.
[1:07:36] Because now some that same uncle comes
[1:07:38] to pick him up and he says I don't want
[1:07:40] you
[1:07:43] [snorts]
[1:07:43] right. Why? Because that's what
[1:07:46] knowledge does.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; This is the problem with knowledge.
[1:07:49] Because and if you don't get the right
[1:07:51] knowledge, knowledge is going to produce
[1:07:53] doubt. So you THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T START
[1:07:56] WITH knowledge first.
[1:07:58] If you have knowledge first, you'll
[1:08:00] starve to death as a baby.
[1:08:04] Once he gets to know his parents, then
[1:08:07] he begins to distrust other people as
[1:08:09] his parents begin to teach him. Now, so
[1:08:11] remember this because we're going to
[1:08:12] speak about this. You're going to see
[1:08:13] this as the development of a human
[1:08:16] being. Isn't it amazing that this is in
[1:08:19] the Bible as a spiritual growth? It so
[1:08:22] matches the natural.
[1:08:24] So his parents begin to teach him. Now
[1:08:27] he's growing. And his parents teach him
[1:08:29] more knowledgeable. They'll tell him
[1:08:31] water.
[1:08:33] Water.
[1:08:35] Say water. What are they teaching him?
[1:08:37] What water is when he when he gets to
[1:08:38] drink water? There's now teach him.
[1:08:40] He'll go wo.
[1:08:43] So now he needs more ability, more
[1:08:45] knowledge. He's going to try and speak
[1:08:47] this. But when the next time he's not
[1:08:50] going to say, "Ah." And they give him
[1:08:53] water. They're going to he's as he's
[1:08:55] growing. HE GOES, "AH." AND THEY SAY,
[1:08:57] "What do you want?" Then he's going to
[1:08:58] go wa then he's ah water why the
[1:09:03] knowledge has given him the ability to
[1:09:06] communicate he's developing
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; but now he he's if he doesn't have faith
[1:09:11] in his parents to give him the water he
[1:09:14] won't use the knowledge to ask them for
[1:09:17] it HAD TO HAVE STARTED WITH FAITH
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; THEN the knowledge works
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; amen so now he begins to start
[1:09:28] questioning everything. He needs his
[1:09:30] parents by his side constantly because
[1:09:32] he's beginning to lose his faith he
[1:09:35] originally had.
[1:09:37] Right? Where once the child lived by
[1:09:40] instinct and faith, now he starts
[1:09:42] depending on knowledge. He now wants to
[1:09:44] know everything. He wants to stick his
[1:09:46] fingers in the plug socket. Even when
[1:09:48] they tell him don't do that, he wants to
[1:09:50] try. They tell him don't do that.
[1:09:53] [snorts]
[1:09:54] He wants to do it. He Why? Because
[1:09:56] knowledge has taken over. He wants to
[1:09:58] know things, right? And so once before
[1:10:02] he lived just instinct and faith, now
[1:10:04] he's depending on knowledge and then
[1:10:08] fear steps in because knowledge brings
[1:10:12] fear as well. Why? Because his parents
[1:10:15] will say, "Don't do that. YOU'LL GET
[1:10:16] HURT. STOP IT. YOU'LL FALL. DON'T DO
[1:10:19] THAT. YOU AND YOU'LL be like you start
[1:10:21] literally seeing it take over his body.
[1:10:27] Trust me, when we get to this, you're
[1:10:29] going to know what I'm talking about.
[1:10:32] And you people, what makes you fear
[1:10:35] demon spirits? Why should you fear
[1:10:37] demons? Why should you fear witch
[1:10:40] doctors and evil things and evil
[1:10:41] paintings and all? Why should Why should
[1:10:43] you fear those things? What made you
[1:10:45] fear? Someone told you a story.
[1:10:49] Someone gave you corrupt knowledge.
[1:10:51] Someone made you afraid of be afraid of
[1:10:54] things that go bump in the night.
[1:10:56] Someone made you afraid of darkness.
[1:10:59] They gave you the wrong knowledge.
[1:11:02] And then knowledge created fear and fear
[1:11:04] created doubt.
[1:11:06] You should be able to stand in pure
[1:11:08] darkness and not be afraid because what
[1:11:10] is it? It's just darkness.
[1:11:13] What's there to be afraid of?
[1:11:17] Right?
[1:11:19] You know, if you want to train a child
[1:11:20] to be a to be not afraid of darkness,
[1:11:23] sit in a dark room with your child and
[1:11:25] play games.
[1:11:28] You ever thought of that?
[1:11:31] Then they get comfortable in there. Play
[1:11:33] games with them. Sit there and say, "Can
[1:11:36] you feel my hand? Can you feel my
[1:11:38] fingers? Can you feel my face? Can you
[1:11:40] see this? Then I'm moving to this corner
[1:11:41] of the room. You come and find me in the
[1:11:44] dark." And they love hide and seek. It's
[1:11:47] pitch dark and then the next thing you
[1:11:49] know the fear why you gave them the
[1:11:51] right knowledge
[1:11:54] but when you yourself and the lights go
[1:11:57] off AND YOU GO OH
[1:11:59] that whole thing transfers to your child
[1:12:01] and your child gets terrified of
[1:12:02] darkness
[1:12:04] h we'll get to that trust me there's so
[1:12:08] much to what our ancestors and parents
[1:12:11] did to us it's crazy the amount of
[1:12:14] things you know among the Indian girls
[1:12:16] are like, "Don't go out in the night
[1:12:18] with your hair open. The spirits will
[1:12:20] grab you."
[1:12:23] You know, when a when a hearse goes by,
[1:12:26] touch wood. Otherwise, you go next.
[1:12:30] You know, I see that. Some of my cousins
[1:12:34] will be like the hearse will be going
[1:12:36] by, they all run to touch some kind of
[1:12:38] wooden furniture. What is going on with
[1:12:40] you people? Oh, no. You have to do that
[1:12:42] otherwise you'll die next.
[1:12:45] It's ridiculous. When you get the wrong
[1:12:48] knowledge, it produces fear and fear
[1:12:50] produces doubt. We're coming to why this
[1:12:52] is important. So knowledge brings fear.
[1:12:56] And
[1:12:58] in some ways, right, let's let's bring a
[1:13:01] balance to this.
[1:13:03] If you tell a child, do not put your
[1:13:05] hand on a hot stove, you are giving him
[1:13:08] knowledge.
[1:13:09] But then [clears throat]
[1:13:11] he's not really going to understand that
[1:13:13] because the knowledge does not become
[1:13:15] effective unless he gets burned once.
[1:13:18] When he gets burned, that's the truth
[1:13:22] of the knowledge you gave him. Now he's
[1:13:24] never going to touch that again. Unless
[1:13:26] he actually experiences heat and cold to
[1:13:30] understand it, to know the truth of it,
[1:13:33] it cannot be powerful to him. A person
[1:13:36] cannot live life just being lectured at.
[1:13:39] You have to experience it.
[1:13:42] So fear also brings wisdom of danger.
[1:13:48] Okay? Let's not trash fear.
[1:13:52] So it's in natural life, it's important
[1:13:54] for us to have fear. Like for example,
[1:13:57] if you're walking on ground that's
[1:13:59] unstable, if you have fear of unstable
[1:14:02] ground, then you'll sense it and you'll
[1:14:04] doubt the ground. You'll walk carefully.
[1:14:06] You'll do something to protect yourself.
[1:14:07] You'll preserve your life. Are you with
[1:14:09] me?
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; However, when it comes to the word of
[1:14:13] God, one should not be cautious with
[1:14:16] God's promises. What's there to be
[1:14:18] cautious about?
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; Our belief in him should be like
[1:14:22] instinct. Like this is father.
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; He loves me. He'll provide for me. He
[1:14:29] knows what I need. I will not doubt him.
[1:14:34] So when it comes to the word, we should
[1:14:36] not be cautious with God's promises. Our
[1:14:38] belief should be instinct. Worse than
[1:14:42] this is something that grew because of
[1:14:44] our love for knowledge. So everybody
[1:14:48] today, if you want to know why our world
[1:14:51] is crumbling,
[1:14:52] are you with me? It's because of the the
[1:14:56] love of knowledge.
[1:14:59] This the smartphone and the internet has
[1:15:02] created the love of knowledge and placed
[1:15:04] the love of knowledge above everything
[1:15:06] else.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; You are consuming knowledge at a rate
[1:15:11] like no other humans in the past.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; Every time you watch YouTube videos or
[1:15:17] listen to a podcast or read the news,
[1:15:20] read the internet,
[1:15:22] let me just give you an example. What if
[1:15:25] the newspapers only reported positive
[1:15:28] news every page? What would your life
[1:15:32] then be?
[1:15:35] Do you realize news only reports
[1:15:37] negative?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Like and most of the headlines is
[1:15:43] something negative. It's something
[1:15:44] against the somebody died, some
[1:15:46] earthquake, some plane crash. So many
[1:15:48] lives were lost. Imagine if they
[1:15:51] reported every plane crash on the the
[1:15:54] front page. You'll never fly a plane
[1:16:00] because that knowledge on increase is
[1:16:02] going to give you fear and you'll never
[1:16:04] fly a plane.
[1:16:07] Every if every page of the newspaper
[1:16:09] every day reports murders, you'll think
[1:16:11] South Africa is filled with murderers.
[1:16:15] like what the Americans think about us
[1:16:17] today, you know, that we are all
[1:16:19] murdering white people in the streets.
[1:16:22] It's just not true. It's not happening.
[1:16:25] Criminals are murdering all races in the
[1:16:27] streets. And and it's not even like
[1:16:29] that. You could we live such a normal
[1:16:32] life. Criminals are are very nervous
[1:16:35] characters who don't want to be seen.
[1:16:37] They want to come and steal something
[1:16:38] and disappear without getting caught.
[1:16:40] It's because we get brave and get in the
[1:16:41] way. We get killed. It's different from
[1:16:44] the actual hitmen who want to kill you
[1:16:45] because you have millions in your bank
[1:16:47] account and they know they can get
[1:16:50] something from you. So in this country,
[1:16:52] if you don't want to be targeted by
[1:16:54] hitman, don't drive a Rolls-Royce and
[1:16:56] flash it around and wear expensive
[1:16:58] clothing and show people how much money
[1:17:00] you have in your live simple, humble, no
[1:17:02] one will touch you.
[1:17:05] [snorts]
[1:17:06] The same same thing everywhere in the
[1:17:07] world, right?
[1:17:10] But look at this idea. The news is only
[1:17:13] negative. And what does negative news
[1:17:15] produce? Doubt, fear, anger, political
[1:17:20] sides being chosen. Nobody tells you the
[1:17:23] good that men do. You know, and in one
[1:17:27] corner of the newspaper on one page, you
[1:17:29] find this old lady saved a dog. Yay.
[1:17:34] Nobody even sees that
[1:17:37] one good news article for the whole
[1:17:39] week. An old lady saved a dog. Okay.
[1:17:43] Risked her life to save a dog.
[1:17:46] Imagine if they stopped writing news
[1:17:50] about only politicians and governments.
[1:17:54] What if they told us things that every
[1:17:56] regular person What if news reporters
[1:17:59] went around reporting on regular things
[1:18:01] that that people like you and I do?
[1:18:03] Would we be interested in it
[1:18:07] today? No,
[1:18:10] today you are addicted to negative news.
[1:18:13] Today you want you're following
[1:18:15] somebody. You're following some guy.
[1:18:18] You're following what they what they're
[1:18:20] talking about Donald Trump. You're
[1:18:21] following what they're talking about
[1:18:22] surroa. You're following the politics of
[1:18:26] the country. You want to know. You
[1:18:28] actually not read that newspaper because
[1:18:29] it's not giving you enough news about
[1:18:31] that. You're addicted to negative news.
[1:18:35] You're addicted to drama.
[1:18:38] And what does it produce in your body?
[1:18:40] Negativity,
[1:18:42] argumentative nature, hostility,
[1:18:46] uh, uh, prejudice.
[1:18:49] It's what knowledge you're feeding is
[1:18:51] what is producing an actual reaction.
[1:18:56] You know, I I meet young people can meet
[1:18:59] them at universities.
[1:19:01] I pick up my son at university, meet
[1:19:04] some of their colleagues and meet some
[1:19:05] of their people and you just within 5
[1:19:07] minutes you can already pick up this is
[1:19:10] not a happy person. This person has been
[1:19:12] indoctrinated with ideologies and and
[1:19:16] hate and nervousness and and all we are
[1:19:20] is one human to another.
[1:19:23] We've got the same red blood. We eat the
[1:19:26] same food. We live we walk in the same
[1:19:28] land. We're the same human beings. But
[1:19:32] what's your reason for distrusting my
[1:19:34] word? What's your reason for
[1:19:36] psychoanalyzing everything I got to say?
[1:19:39] Why can't we just take one another as
[1:19:41] human to human and appreciate who we
[1:19:43] are?
[1:19:45] Why? Because you're being fed negativity
[1:19:47] all your life.
[1:19:50] Why am I telling you this?
[1:19:52] What happens when you as a church are
[1:19:55] fed only one thing all the time?
[1:19:59] What happens to a message church when
[1:20:01] all you have is being corrected,
[1:20:04] corrected, corrected on the rules, the
[1:20:07] rules, the rules, the dressing, the
[1:20:08] this, don't do this, don't do that. What
[1:20:10] do you think you're going to become?
[1:20:15] What what what if you are not being
[1:20:17] taught the goodness of God, the
[1:20:19] graciousness graciousness of God, the
[1:20:22] the wealth, the richness in his word,
[1:20:25] the the word that teaches you what our
[1:20:28] behavior ought to be that challenges the
[1:20:31] fear and the doubt in your soul and
[1:20:33] brings light.
[1:20:36] See,
[1:20:38] we always want to know something about
[1:20:40] everything. We won't. And listen, all of
[1:20:44] us fall to this, right? You won't buy
[1:20:48] something unless you read the label. Am
[1:20:50] I right?
[1:20:52] And we don't understand. We don't if we
[1:20:54] don't understand the label, we'll go to
[1:20:56] someone who works there and say, "This
[1:20:58] says this. What do you think about this?
[1:21:00] What do you recommend?"
[1:21:02] But you get some people who say, "Yeah,
[1:21:05] let's try it."
[1:21:07] Right? That doesn't mean those people
[1:21:09] have faith.
[1:21:12] And neither does the other person have
[1:21:15] faith. Nah, let's try it. Is not faith.
[1:21:18] That's that's like risky behavior.
[1:21:21] That's like, well, there's a river
[1:21:23] there. There's a cliff here. Let's just
[1:21:24] jump off and see if it's deep enough for
[1:21:27] me to have a swim in. You're jumping
[1:21:29] from 30 m high. Let's just jump off and
[1:21:32] see if I live. That's stupidity.
[1:21:36] Okay. So we when we see those people who
[1:21:39] say ah let's try it we call them naive
[1:21:42] and reckless and immature but truthfully
[1:21:46] some people who will will be they
[1:21:48] probably live by instinct more than
[1:21:51] others
[1:21:52] like you so you get a lot of people who
[1:21:54] live by instinct they actually have a
[1:21:56] little bit more faith like you get
[1:21:58] people who will look down at the river
[1:22:00] and they'll see oh it's flowing quite
[1:22:02] fast that means it's quite deep and I
[1:22:06] can't see any And there's a certain
[1:22:07] color and this they are more in tune to
[1:22:10] their instincts than you are. And you
[1:22:12] look there for one, it's too high. I'm
[1:22:15] not doing this. I don't trust anything.
[1:22:17] Somebody will actually jump in and
[1:22:19] you'll see them falling. Hey, it's okay.
[1:22:21] You can jump. No way. I'm not doing it.
[1:22:24] I don't care whether you survive. I'm
[1:22:26] not doing this. You're just someone who
[1:22:28] doesn't even trust your own instincts,
[1:22:31] right? Because you've been brought up in
[1:22:33] a certain way.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:36] So we have become so dependent on
[1:22:39] knowledge that we doubt everything that
[1:22:43] we don't know about. To us that is
[1:22:47] natural and there is nothing wrong with
[1:22:49] that. So we live our lives being
[1:22:51] faith-based on our knowledge.
[1:22:57] That's the problem with the Christian
[1:22:59] church. You are telling yourself, you
[1:23:02] are basing your faith upon your
[1:23:03] knowledge. Your knowledge must be based
[1:23:06] on your faith.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; See, so if we know about something, then
[1:23:13] we won't doubt it. That's how we think
[1:23:15] and then I'll have faith in it.
[1:23:18] Like that's so flawed because how do you
[1:23:23] know that what you know is actually
[1:23:25] right
[1:23:29] and it doesn't work? It never works.
[1:23:32] Right? we will even then now you you
[1:23:35] collect all this knowledge in and then
[1:23:37] you say okay now I understand it and now
[1:23:39] I want to base my faith on now I'm going
[1:23:41] to believe it because I understand it
[1:23:44] right and then you you say okay now I
[1:23:47] want to spread my faith I want to go
[1:23:49] tell people now you go and tell people
[1:23:51] and other people they listen to what
[1:23:54] you're saying they don't have all your
[1:23:56] knowledge but they think you're a fraud
[1:24:00] you don't really believe what you're
[1:24:03] And they're right because you base your
[1:24:06] faith on your knowledge. You don't have
[1:24:09] knowledge based on faith. Which means
[1:24:11] they can tell people can tell that your
[1:24:14] conviction is not real.
[1:24:19] This is how when a politician is
[1:24:21] speaking, giving a speech when S.
[1:24:23] Raapora is giving us a speech and we
[1:24:25] know hey come on you can tell there's no
[1:24:30] conviction in there.
[1:24:32] And he says, "Fellow South Africans,
[1:24:34] everything is going to be all right."
[1:24:37] Right? It doesn't matter which. Whether
[1:24:39] it's Emanuel Mcron from France, whether
[1:24:41] it's Donald Trump from America, wherever
[1:24:43] they are, when they come out and give us
[1:24:44] a speech, the moment they say good
[1:24:46] morning, we know the first thing he's
[1:24:49] saying is a lie.
[1:24:51] The way he's standing there, what they
[1:24:54] came, they put the flags behind, they
[1:24:56] painted, they put up a screen. People
[1:24:58] only do that when they're not telling
[1:25:00] you the full truth.
[1:25:03] Like why can't you tell the truth from
[1:25:04] wherever you are? Why do you need the
[1:25:06] whole setup to make you look like you
[1:25:09] are loyal to the flag to put the colors
[1:25:11] there to have certain important people
[1:25:13] like if you're coming to tell the people
[1:25:15] about the labor unions? You have labor
[1:25:18] labor union representatives there. Why
[1:25:21] must you have them there? To convince
[1:25:23] the people on the TV that I'm telling
[1:25:25] you the truth. Even these people agree
[1:25:27] with me. In the meantime, you paid them
[1:25:29] 10,000 rand each to be there.
[1:25:35] H right. WHAT AM I SAYING TO YOU? YOU
[1:25:38] GOT no knowledge, but you can tell
[1:25:40] you're a fraud.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; You has no conviction in you. You're
[1:25:44] you're knowledgeable. You're spouting
[1:25:46] all the right words in the legislature
[1:25:49] and the laws of the country and you're
[1:25:52] saying all the right things. You got the
[1:25:53] right catchphrases. And you even know
[1:25:55] they've got these the little screens
[1:25:57] here. You know these teleprompterss
[1:25:59] where their words are flowing for them
[1:26:01] to just they're looking right and left
[1:26:03] and they're just reading things off a
[1:26:04] script and you know it's not even
[1:26:07] written by them. It's written by speech
[1:26:09] writers.
[1:26:10] So if you you're not even saying your
[1:26:12] own word, you're saying what your party
[1:26:15] wrote there for you to say. Who are you?
[1:26:18] You're a puppet.
[1:26:20] You're speaking words but you're not
[1:26:22] even you have no conviction over that's
[1:26:24] why I'm saying even to come here and
[1:26:26] preach a message and to go into chat GPT
[1:26:29] and say give me a message about you know
[1:26:31] stature of perfect man faith and he puts
[1:26:34] it out and then I come and preach from
[1:26:35] chat GPT I haven't even studied it I
[1:26:38] haven't even thought about I haven't
[1:26:39] even looked at it you'll know
[1:26:40] immediately this guy's a fraud
[1:26:44] are you with me trust me that's going to
[1:26:47] happen a lot of people are already
[1:26:49] spouting sermons from Chad GPT.
[1:26:54] So we live our lives having faith based
[1:26:58] faith based on our knowledge and that's
[1:27:00] wrong. It's not it's not so with God.
[1:27:04] God needs to know that you can have
[1:27:06] faith
[1:27:08] and then he can give you knowledge.
[1:27:11] Just like that little baby once had
[1:27:13] faith and then knowledge came in. So
[1:27:15] does God require that of us. He begins
[1:27:19] our growth with faith AND ONLY THE THIRD
[1:27:22] STEP IS KNOWLEDGE.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Even before that is virtue.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So when you have faith
[1:27:31] in him, do you uh only then can you
[1:27:35] really get to know God. So So let's put
[1:27:37] it back to this baby. All the baby knows
[1:27:40] is these two people, mom and dad. He
[1:27:43] still doesn't even know what their names
[1:27:45] are. For the first few years of your
[1:27:47] child's life, you are mommy and daddy.
[1:27:50] They don't know you. They don't know how
[1:27:52] you met. They don't know where you came
[1:27:54] from. They don't even they know grandma
[1:27:56] and grandpa. They don't even know how
[1:27:58] grandma and grandpa are connected to him
[1:28:00] to him or to you. They don't even know
[1:28:03] that's your that's daddy's father.
[1:28:05] That's mommy's father. They don't know
[1:28:07] that. They get zero knowledge on that.
[1:28:09] They just recognize you're a familiar
[1:28:11] person who comes to this house every day
[1:28:13] and gives me treats and tells me nice
[1:28:16] things and your name is grandpa
[1:28:19] or grandma. They have no connection
[1:28:23] to who you are in the family. They don't
[1:28:26] even know who their siblings are. The
[1:28:28] little baby grows up. This is his
[1:28:31] brother and sister. He doesn't even know
[1:28:33] who they are. There's no knowledge. All
[1:28:36] he has is ability to get along with
[1:28:38] them. Amen.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; He's going to get to know who they are
[1:28:42] over time.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:28:47] &gt;&gt; That's how it works. God's not even
[1:28:50] going to give you knowledge from the
[1:28:51] get- go.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; You need faith first.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; To have faith is to believe in something
[1:28:58] without proof. Amen. Believe in it
[1:29:02] without proof or reason or want of
[1:29:06] anything.
[1:29:08] Okay, let's get to doubt versus faith.
[1:29:10] Are you still with me? Believe me, we're
[1:29:13] more than halfway through.
[1:29:17] So, doubt is not a real thing.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; Just as death is not a real thing, life
[1:29:25] is real.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; Death is the absence of life.
[1:29:30] Got it? If you see a a dead man,
[1:29:34] that's no longer a person. The person is
[1:29:38] gone. That that cannot even be
[1:29:40] identified. There's no identification.
[1:29:42] There's no life in it. It cannot speak.
[1:29:45] The dead body is is just now an empty
[1:29:48] shell.
[1:29:50] It is a nothing.
[1:29:54] It then becomes you put it in the
[1:29:55] ground, you put it in the furnace, it
[1:29:57] has gone into nothing. That death is
[1:30:00] nothing.
[1:30:02] Life is everything.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Life is real.
[1:30:06] Light is real. What is darkness? It's
[1:30:09] the absence of light.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; What is doubt then? It's the absence of
[1:30:13] faith.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; How do we know that? Because when a baby
[1:30:17] is born, he starts off with faith first.
[1:30:21] Then he is bad knowledge starts removing
[1:30:24] faith and the absence of faith is doubt.
[1:30:29] Got it? That's the simple concept of it.
[1:30:32] Now let's test it. Truth is reality.
[1:30:37] Lies is not reality.
[1:30:40] Are we together?
[1:30:44] Do you understand? Is that clear?
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; If someone lies to you about it, it
[1:30:48] means it's not true. It means it doesn't
[1:30:50] exist.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; The truth actually exists. The lie is
[1:30:54] not real.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; So if someone said, "Brother Alistister
[1:30:58] said this," and if that's the truth,
[1:31:02] that's exactly what happened. But if
[1:31:04] they told you I said something that I
[1:31:06] did not, it it's not even real. It never
[1:31:10] even happened. The words they said that
[1:31:13] I said did not even go out into the
[1:31:15] ether.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; It's a lie. It never even happened. Are
[1:31:20] you with me? It's not reality. So what
[1:31:23] is a lie then? It's the absence of
[1:31:25] truth.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Death is the absence of life. These are
[1:31:29] there there are real things. Love is
[1:31:32] real.
[1:31:33] Uh life is real, truth is real.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; And they have become now what's happened
[1:31:40] in in this world is you are being fed
[1:31:43] lies every day on the internet, in the
[1:31:47] newspapers, in religions.
[1:31:50] Is that right? And you are living by
[1:31:54] something. You are trying to put faith
[1:31:56] in something that is not real. It's not
[1:32:00] even true.
[1:32:04] And what's going to happen is everything
[1:32:07] that that is unreal is being posed to us
[1:32:10] as being the truth and being real being
[1:32:14] reality.
[1:32:15] So then what happens is it comes into us
[1:32:18] and uh because of doubt we start to
[1:32:22] accept things that are not real as if
[1:32:24] they are real.
[1:32:27] Let's make that plain.
[1:32:30] If somebody comes to you and lies to you
[1:32:31] about your brother or sister or family
[1:32:34] member and you believe the lie, what
[1:32:36] does it mean? What does it even mean
[1:32:38] that you believe the lie? Because it's
[1:32:40] not even real.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; What it means is you accepted it by
[1:32:46] knowledge and reasoning and you now are
[1:32:49] acting upon it
[1:32:52] to go and live by it. You're starting to
[1:32:55] live by something that is not real. That
[1:32:57] means you'll start if somebody comes and
[1:33:00] tells you that person said this about
[1:33:02] you and it's not real. You then will
[1:33:04] start living your life treating that
[1:33:07] person in a way as if they actually said
[1:33:10] something and that person is genuinely
[1:33:12] confused. Like why is that person not
[1:33:14] greeting me today? Why did they not
[1:33:16] shake my hand? Did I do something? Did I
[1:33:18] say something? And that per and you're
[1:33:20] walking around like yeah I know what you
[1:33:22] said.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; You know this is how it's going to be.
[1:33:26] I'm not going to phone you. I'm not
[1:33:27] going to visit you. I'm not going to do
[1:33:28] anything from now on. You don't even You
[1:33:30] sit over there. I sit over here and it's
[1:33:32] not even reality.
[1:33:37] Amen. So what happens is someone gave
[1:33:40] you false knowledge and it's allowing
[1:33:43] doubt to enter in because faith is being
[1:33:46] removed. Knowledge does not necessarily
[1:33:50] mean truth. Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Sometimes the knowledge that you receive
[1:33:55] is corrupt knowledge and it produces
[1:33:58] more doubt than it should. Are you with
[1:34:01] me? Let's read. Greatest battle ever
[1:34:03] fought. The great hour of charge is at
[1:34:06] hand. Hallelujah. Soldiers with with
[1:34:09] armor gleaming, color streaming. Faith
[1:34:11] and doubt. I want you to see brother man
[1:34:13] is saying faith and doubt is set is
[1:34:17] setting themselves in array. Faith and
[1:34:20] doubt like two armies are setting
[1:34:23] themselves ready for battle in this
[1:34:26] tabernacle this morning. Doubt on one
[1:34:30] side, faith on the other side. Soldiers
[1:34:33] stand at your post of duty.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our captain the morning
[1:34:37] starling John. He never goes back. He
[1:34:39] don't know the word retreat. He don't
[1:34:41] have to retreat. Amen. The faith side
[1:34:43] does not retreat. The greatest battle
[1:34:46] ever fought is going on right now. Yes,
[1:34:47] sir. Between life and death, between
[1:34:49] sickness and hell, between faith and
[1:34:51] doubt. Oh my. Between liberty and
[1:34:53] bondage, the battle is on. Shine your
[1:34:55] spears, soldiers, polish up the armor.
[1:34:57] There is always been a war going on in
[1:35:00] our souls between doubt and faith.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Since doubt is not a real thing, you
[1:35:05] cannot really get doubt out.
[1:35:10] You can only put faith in.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; You got it?
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; All right. This is why the only thing
[1:35:18] you can actually place faith in is
[1:35:20] truth.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Let's go to expectancy message
[1:35:26] expectancy. Faith knows no defeat. Faith
[1:35:29] is perfect. Faith brings things when
[1:35:31] there is no things to be brought. Faith
[1:35:34] creates. Faith takes doubt away. Takes
[1:35:36] negative and makes positive. How
[1:35:38] beautiful. Faith is not mythical.
[1:35:40] Something mentally worked up. It's an
[1:35:43] absolutely fundamental result that
[1:35:45] happens in a person's heart. When faith
[1:35:47] is appropriated, there is something in
[1:35:50] the person's heart. But it can't be
[1:35:52] based on say well go touch a tree,
[1:35:54] you'll get well. Pray to the post. It's
[1:35:57] got to have a foundation.
[1:36:01] That foundation is the cornerstone. It's
[1:36:03] got to be based on Christ. Let's go to
[1:36:05] Romans 10:17.
[1:36:07] So then faith cometh by hearing and
[1:36:09] hearing by the word of God. Now hold
[1:36:12] that thought. Faith cometh by hearing.
[1:36:14] In the Bible, hearing does not mean I
[1:36:17] heard you.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; In the Bible, when they say I hear you,
[1:36:21] it means I understand you.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Now, faith comes by understanding.
[1:36:27] And not just understanding.
[1:36:30] Understanding comes by the word of God.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Faith comes by understanding.
[1:36:35] Understanding comes by the word of God.
[1:36:38] Which means you must have understanding
[1:36:42] that comes from God that Jesus is the
[1:36:45] Christ.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; And faith comes by that.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; Hearing. So you don't need all the
[1:36:54] knowledge in the world. Do you see that?
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; You don't need knowledge. This is the
[1:37:00] fallacy. Knowledge doesn't give you
[1:37:02] understanding.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:06] I mean, do you know how many people read
[1:37:08] the newspaper and don't get the right
[1:37:10] thing?
[1:37:12] Do you know how many people read the
[1:37:13] internet and get the wrong You can hear
[1:37:15] 20 different stories from the same
[1:37:17] article.
[1:37:19] That means people will read the same
[1:37:21] thing and not get the right
[1:37:22] understanding. Do you know how many This
[1:37:24] is the reason I still have a job.
[1:37:29] When I say that, I mean that as a
[1:37:32] pastor, the reason why there still has
[1:37:33] to be a five-fold ministry is because
[1:37:35] people read the Bible for 2,000 or 1,500
[1:37:39] years, the English Bible, and still get
[1:37:41] it wrong.
[1:37:43] Which means the only thing is we by the
[1:37:45] Holy Ghost are tasked to bring
[1:37:48] understanding.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; We can't rewrite the Bible. The Bible is
[1:37:53] there. There's the knowledge.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; We are tasked by the Holy Spirit to
[1:37:57] bring understanding.
[1:38:01] See it. The word of God gives us
[1:38:03] understanding only because of one thing.
[1:38:06] The Holy Spirit.
[1:38:08] He shall guide you into all truth.
[1:38:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:17 to 18. that the God of
[1:38:17] our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of
[1:38:18] glory, may give unto you the spirit of
[1:38:20] wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[1:38:22] of him, the eyes of your understanding
[1:38:24] being enlightened, that you may know
[1:38:25] what is the hope of his calling and what
[1:38:27] the riches of the glory of his
[1:38:28] inheritance in the saints. The eyes of
[1:38:31] your understanding
[1:38:33] being enlightened.
[1:38:35] What does it mean? How does it happen?
[1:38:38] By the Holy Spirit. How he's going to
[1:38:40] give you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:38:42] revelation.
[1:38:44] Can you see that? that he may give you
[1:38:46] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[1:38:48] the knowledge of him. He's not giving
[1:38:50] you the knowledge of him so you can get
[1:38:52] wisdom and revelation.
[1:38:59] Job 32:8, "But there is a spirit in man,
[1:39:02] and I love this, and the inspiration of
[1:39:05] the Almighty giveth them understanding."
[1:39:08] Yes.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; So faith cometh by understanding and
[1:39:12] understanding comes by the spirit of
[1:39:15] God.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; Understanding comes by the word of God.
[1:39:19] So people will say, "Oh, the word of
[1:39:20] God, the Bible, that's the written
[1:39:22] word." The word of God is a person.
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; It's the logos. It's the revelation of
[1:39:28] all things.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 14:14-15.
[1:39:33] For I pray, For if I pray in an unknown
[1:39:36] tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
[1:39:39] understanding is unfruitful.
[1:39:41] What is it then? I will pray with the
[1:39:44] SPIRIT AND I WILL pray with the
[1:39:47] understanding also.
[1:39:50] I will sing with the spirit and I will
[1:39:52] sing with the understanding also. You
[1:39:55] don't just pray. You don't just sing.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; You sing with understanding. You pray
[1:40:01] with understanding.
[1:40:04] Most Christians only want to sing in the
[1:40:06] spirit, shout in the spirit, pray in the
[1:40:09] spirit. Do you hear that? They think
[1:40:12] praying in the spirit means praying with
[1:40:13] tongues.
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Where's the understanding? Because if
[1:40:17] you have the understanding, then you'll
[1:40:19] be led of God to pray the right thing.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; To know what it is you're singing.
[1:40:26] So understanding then is actually
[1:40:29] revelation which is what the rock from
[1:40:32] the beginning.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith can only come into your soul
[1:40:37] if God grants you revelation. Saints,
[1:40:40] let me put it to you this way and I and
[1:40:42] I keep saying this in our church back
[1:40:44] home in Durban. Um the only way you can
[1:40:48] really grasp this is like marriage.
[1:40:55] Marriage has to start with faith,
[1:40:59] not even love.
[1:41:01] Because love is so far a concept you're
[1:41:04] coming into.
[1:41:06] Like when two when a young boy and a
[1:41:08] young girl meet each other, they don't
[1:41:10] know it. Do you agree? They don't know
[1:41:11] anything. In other words, zero
[1:41:13] knowledge.
[1:41:15] Agreed.
[1:41:17] She looks attractive. He looks
[1:41:20] attractive. He's got a nice job. She's
[1:41:23] got a nice job. He's got a nice family.
[1:41:25] She's got a nice family. Those things
[1:41:26] you're only going to know when you start
[1:41:28] talking to each other. You will never
[1:41:32] start talking to each other unless it
[1:41:34] begins with a little faith.
[1:41:37] It has to start with faith. You have to
[1:41:40] first trust. There must be like some
[1:41:43] small modicum of trust to come forward
[1:41:46] and to start speaking to each other
[1:41:48] first.
[1:41:49] Because if there's no trust, there's
[1:41:51] only doubt. You'll say, "The guy's a
[1:41:53] creep. I don't want to talk to him. She
[1:41:55] just doesn't look right. I just don't
[1:41:56] want to talk to her. I want nothing to
[1:41:57] do with him. What? You don't even know
[1:41:59] them. Your friends are going to say,
[1:42:00] "GIVE IT A SHOT." YOU DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK.
[1:42:03] YOU DIDN'T EVEN take him on the first
[1:42:04] date. You didn't take her on the first
[1:42:06] date, second date, third date to get to
[1:42:07] know them. Try that. It doesn't work.
[1:42:10] You try first date, second date, third
[1:42:12] date, fourth date. By the time if you're
[1:42:14] still going to take dates to find out,
[1:42:17] you start ending up with more doubt.
[1:42:21] If you're a person who's been filled
[1:42:23] with doubt already, your faith is not
[1:42:26] going to give you the correct knowledge.
[1:42:31] And every kind of knowledge you're going
[1:42:32] to get thereafter. So this is why I
[1:42:35] often say to people for a marriage to
[1:42:38] work, you have to never stop believing
[1:42:42] in each other.
[1:42:45] Love will become perfected because you
[1:42:47] believe in each other. There it is.
[1:42:51] You understand? Love will break down if
[1:42:54] you stop believing in each other. It
[1:42:57] always has to be faith.
[1:43:02] Understanding
[1:43:04] that then is actual revelation. Are you
[1:43:06] still with me saints? The only thing you
[1:43:08] can do to get it is as much of his word
[1:43:11] as possible when it comes now to God. So
[1:43:15] after you have had faith now you go and
[1:43:18] he's going to give you the word based on
[1:43:20] that faith and that knowledge is going
[1:43:23] to give you the correct knowledge which
[1:43:25] is going to increase your faith which is
[1:43:27] going to allow everything else to be
[1:43:28] built upon that bringing you to
[1:43:31] perfection.
[1:43:33] Amen. So if we can do this in the
[1:43:35] natural with natural things like the
[1:43:38] natural growth of a child,
[1:43:40] uh so also is this possible in the
[1:43:43] spiritual except God has to give it to
[1:43:46] us first to start us off. There's no way
[1:43:49] you're going to do it yourself. Thou art
[1:43:52] the Christ, the son of the living God.
[1:43:53] No man could have revealed this to you
[1:43:55] but my father which is in heaven. Which
[1:43:57] means when you are seeing Christ, no man
[1:44:02] is going to convince you. Only God can
[1:44:06] do that.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; God is going to be the beginner. That's
[1:44:09] why the the first faith you receive is
[1:44:12] the gift of faith.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; You love him, saints.
[1:44:17] And and you know all the scriptures. No
[1:44:19] man can come to me except my father
[1:44:22] draws him. No man can call Jesus the
[1:44:25] Christ except by the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:44:31] let's bring this to a close.
[1:44:34] Saints, doubt is sin.
[1:44:40] What I I I feel like a lot of people
[1:44:44] like I've got to stop here and tell you
[1:44:47] a lot of people don't know what sin is.
[1:44:50] People think sin is to, you know, like
[1:44:54] do something against God's word.
[1:44:58] A lot of us do things against God's word
[1:45:01] every day
[1:45:03] simply because we are humans who haven't
[1:45:06] gotten over ourselves yet
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; and we're hard-headed, stubborn things,
[1:45:10] you know, and we still trying to get our
[1:45:12] own way. That doesn't mean we hate God
[1:45:14] or we disbelieve him. That still just
[1:45:16] means we're struggling a little with
[1:45:18] ourselves. And God understands that
[1:45:19] that's not sin.
[1:45:22] When in the Bible it says fornication is
[1:45:24] a sin against your own body, what it
[1:45:27] means is you're damaging your own
[1:45:29] nature.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; You you're doing something to yourself.
[1:45:33] Of course, God can heal that, right? God
[1:45:36] can heal anything.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; But sin is something that corrupts the
[1:45:41] original nature.
[1:45:43] That's what sin is.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Okay, hold this in in in mind. Let's go
[1:45:48] to all things are possible to him that
[1:45:51] believeth.
[1:45:53] Doubt is always of the devil. That's
[1:45:57] where the first sin come from. There is
[1:46:00] no other sin but doubt. Unbelief is the
[1:46:04] So in other words, he's he's saying
[1:46:06] doubt equals unbelief.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; unbelief is the original and only sin.
[1:46:14] Committing adultery is not a sin.
[1:46:17] Smoking
[1:46:18] cigarettes is not a sin. Getting drunk
[1:46:21] is not a sin. That's attributes of
[1:46:24] unbelief.
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to draw you to. Doing
[1:46:28] all those things that then hurts your
[1:46:31] body.
[1:46:32] You're only doing that because there is
[1:46:35] doubt in your heart.
[1:46:37] Because there is unbelief in your heart.
[1:46:40] You got it?
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Those are attributes. Attributes means
[1:46:44] they they are actually things that are
[1:46:46] going to produce be produced because of
[1:46:49] something.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; You know any child born in this world is
[1:46:57] not an evil being
[1:47:00] is a just a real regular innocent
[1:47:04] perfect little soul. That soul is going
[1:47:08] to be hurt by humans from its parents to
[1:47:13] its siblings to its teachers to its
[1:47:15] university lectures. It's going to be
[1:47:17] constantly trampled on putting in doubt
[1:47:20] into this little soul
[1:47:23] and it turns from being an innocent
[1:47:25] being into somebody who is led down a
[1:47:27] path. Okay. So in the prayer lines,
[1:47:31] brother Madam would constantly pray that
[1:47:34] God would remove the doubt from the
[1:47:36] hearts of the people.
[1:47:38] He said in other places that doubt is
[1:47:41] sin, drinking smoke in many other places
[1:47:44] they're not sin. Doubt is the actual
[1:47:46] sin. All these things were attributes of
[1:47:49] doubt and sin. It is because of doubt
[1:47:52] that we go out and do all these other
[1:47:55] things. without doubt we would be doing
[1:47:58] things of God and living righteously.
[1:48:02] Let's go to Matthew 21:21-22.
[1:48:05] Just one scripture and one quote and we
[1:48:07] close.
[1:48:08] Faith can accomplish great things. H
[1:48:12] let's see it.
[1:48:14] Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:48:16] "Verily I say unto you, if you have
[1:48:17] faith and doubt not, you shall not only
[1:48:21] do this which is done to the fig tree,
[1:48:23] but also if you shall say unto this
[1:48:24] mountain, be thou removed, and be thou
[1:48:26] cast into the sea," it shall be done.
[1:48:29] And all things whatsoever you shall ask
[1:48:31] in prayer believing, he shall receive.
[1:48:33] You shall receive. So this is the thing.
[1:48:35] People want to be people that move
[1:48:37] mountains.
[1:48:39] What mountains?
[1:48:42] Hey, like I I want to leave the
[1:48:45] dragonsburg where it is.
[1:48:47] There's no reason to go move that. It
[1:48:49] looks beautiful right there. There's no
[1:48:52] reason to move actual. So what are the
[1:48:54] mountains he's talking about? It's the
[1:48:57] strongholds of things caused by unbelief
[1:49:00] and doubt.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Right? You see the mountain as your
[1:49:07] problem. You you see the smoking, the
[1:49:10] drinking, the fornication, the
[1:49:12] pornography. You see that as the
[1:49:14] mountain? That's not even the mountain.
[1:49:18] That's been stuff built on a foundation
[1:49:21] of doubt.
[1:49:23] What is causing you to doubt?
[1:49:26] What is causing you to devalue yourself?
[1:49:30] Right? Faith can accomplish great things
[1:49:35] if there's light in your soul. You
[1:49:37] wouldn't desire that. If there's light
[1:49:40] in your soul, if you're living by a life
[1:49:41] of faith, you'll be more relaxed. You'll
[1:49:45] believe in people. You'll believe in
[1:49:48] God. You believe tomorrow is secure. God
[1:49:52] knows all things. You'll wake up with a
[1:49:55] smile. You'll trust him in all things.
[1:49:58] Faith can accomplish great things. The
[1:50:00] greatest battle of a fought. The last
[1:50:01] quote as we close.
[1:50:04] You can have little consciences and
[1:50:06] little feelings and little sensations
[1:50:07] and all these things that has nothing to
[1:50:10] do with it. That's just little
[1:50:12] sensations and things. And when it comes
[1:50:14] to reality, your mind opens it up. Your
[1:50:17] mind either accepts it or rejects it.
[1:50:20] That's it, friends. God let none of them
[1:50:23] miss it. It's your mind that opens up
[1:50:25] the door or closes the door. Listens to
[1:50:27] your conscience. Listens to your memory.
[1:50:29] listens to your affections. But when
[1:50:31] your mind closes itself to these things
[1:50:33] and let God, the spirit of his word,
[1:50:36] come in, it blows the rest of the stuff
[1:50:39] out. Every doubt is gone. Every fear is
[1:50:41] gone. Every sensation of doubt is gone.
[1:50:43] Every feeling is gone. There's nothing
[1:50:46] standing there but the word of God. And
[1:50:48] Satan cannot battle against that. No
[1:50:51] sir, he cannot battle against it. Now,
[1:50:54] we know that's the truth. So this is our
[1:50:57] biggest fight here on earth. In the
[1:51:00] stature of a perfect man, faith is the
[1:51:03] first step. It is the foundation. It's
[1:51:05] quite clear. He had to take away doubt
[1:51:09] before attempting to put the other
[1:51:11] virtues in us.
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; Faith is the strength. It's uh it's the
[1:51:16] one of the seven virtues we need to
[1:51:19] overcome doubt in our souls. Amen.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; So in closing,
[1:51:24] I want to explain that to you. When you
[1:51:27] live as a person with more doubt than
[1:51:30] faith, that's when you become anxious of
[1:51:32] everything. Untrusting,
[1:51:35] where you believe even when people
[1:51:37] telling you the truth, you don't trust
[1:51:38] them. You believe they're lying. Uh
[1:51:42] living like that is stressful. It causes
[1:51:44] depression. It puts problems in
[1:51:48] marriages. It put problem between father
[1:51:50] and child. It put problems between
[1:51:53] teachers and and students. It puts
[1:51:56] problems between the heads of countries
[1:51:57] and the people because people are living
[1:52:01] with darkness in their souls. If you
[1:52:04] lived with people who have faith, if
[1:52:07] people have faith and people live by
[1:52:10] faith, you will be more positive. You'll
[1:52:13] want to testify of your faith. And when
[1:52:15] you testify and you tell people of Jesus
[1:52:18] Christ, they will see that there is a
[1:52:20] conviction inside. If you preach the
[1:52:22] word, they'll know you know what you're
[1:52:24] talking about. They know you believe
[1:52:27] what you're talking about because they
[1:52:29] can sense there is light from within.
[1:52:31] There's something else coming. But when
[1:52:33] you yourself have doubt, they'll sense
[1:52:35] it. What I'm saying to you is if you
[1:52:38] have doubt in your soul, it leads down a
[1:52:40] certain path. If you have faith, it
[1:52:42] leads down a different path.
[1:52:45] Literally
[1:52:47] everything about your life will be
[1:52:49] different if you have faith.
[1:52:55] I mean even your home will be decorated
[1:52:59] differently.
[1:53:02] H even your dogs will be happier.
[1:53:07] Do you know that a dog is a pack animal?
[1:53:10] You have dogs. They'll they'll literally
[1:53:13] tell you dogs take on the the nature of
[1:53:15] the owner.
[1:53:17] You understand? So if you got stupid
[1:53:18] dogs, you know what it means, right?
[1:53:22] I'm just kidding.
[1:53:24] You've got to understand that faith and
[1:53:28] doubt produces different parts of life.
[1:53:30] It's the foundation for all things and
[1:53:34] you will build every aspect of your
[1:53:36] life. If you have children and if you
[1:53:39] live with doubt, you will raise your
[1:53:41] children on doubt.
[1:53:43] That'll produce a certain path for them.
[1:53:46] If you raise your children on faith, it
[1:53:48] will produce a certain path for them.
[1:53:51] It all starts there. Faith is the
[1:53:54] perfect foundation and the only
[1:53:56] destroyer of doubt.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let us bow our heads
[1:54:00] together.
