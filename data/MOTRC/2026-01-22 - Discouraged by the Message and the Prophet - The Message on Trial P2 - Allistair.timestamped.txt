[0:07] God bless you saints. Uh we certainly
[0:10] are happy to be here with you sharing
[0:12] God's word and uh getting into these
[0:17] subjects is never an easy thing but we
[0:19] are grateful to God that he has given us
[0:21] the opportunity to do so. we realize
[0:24] that it's uh you know closing times and
[0:29] we can see that the world is um in such
[0:32] a state so many things happening in the
[0:35] politics of the world and um the
[0:37] Christian world the religious world and
[0:40] so we appreciate what God has done for
[0:43] us in this time.
[0:46] So uh and we appreciate that we have
[0:50] this cliff in the rock. we have this
[0:52] message that is um just uh beyond
[0:56] amazing. And so we want to speak this
[1:00] evening on um discouraged by the message
[1:05] and the prophet and this is going to be
[1:06] part two and uh so and of course the
[1:11] title is the message on trial. So we
[1:14] like to begin with our scripture reading
[1:17] from John chapter 20 and verse 29-31.
[1:22] So I'm just going to share the screen so
[1:26] you could follow with me. John 20 29-31.
[1:31] And the Bible reads like this. Jesus
[1:34] saith unto him, Thomas, because thou
[1:37] hast seen me, thou hast believed.
[1:41] Blessed are they that have not seen and
[1:44] yet have believed. And many other signs
[1:47] truly did Jesus in the presence of his
[1:49] disciples, which are not written in this
[1:52] book. But these are written that you
[1:55] might believe that Jesus is the Christ,
[1:59] the son of God, and that believing you
[2:03] might have life through his name. Amen.
[2:06] The Lord add a blessing to his word.
[2:11] So I want to begin with some um
[2:16] introductory statements
[2:18] and uh just to explain what's been going
[2:21] on. So
[2:23] um
[2:25] firstly
[2:27] with all the feedback from last week's
[2:29] service
[2:31] and of course you can imagine with
[2:33] people desiring that we debate the
[2:36] website creators of believe the sign and
[2:39] seeking the truth and all of that and uh
[2:42] I just want to say you know this is the
[2:44] ancient desire in man to see a battle of
[2:48] gladiators and men slaying one another.
[2:50] It's just this enjoyment that people get
[2:53] from seeing people or men go into
[2:56] battle.
[2:58] There is literally no point to
[3:01] a debate between me and any uh anti-
[3:05] message person. Believe me, it's I'm not
[3:08] afraid of uh debate or arguments. I've
[3:10] had plenty of them in my life and I've
[3:13] seen where it goes to. I've had
[3:16] um discussions and conversations with
[3:19] people who have left the message. So I
[3:21] actually know how this will go. You
[3:25] know, they have their minds made up and
[3:27] my faith is rock solid. And so it leads
[3:31] me to ask them questions on the word
[3:34] which they try to answer but cannot
[3:37] really answer because they end up saying
[3:38] things that the prophet taught or backed
[3:41] into a corner and they get defensive.
[3:45] Then they keep insisting that I explain
[3:48] uh the prophets failed prophecies and
[3:51] plagiarism and which they have articles
[3:54] and evidence which I just don't buy into
[3:56] because it doesn't interest me. And when
[3:58] I present them with what atheists say
[4:01] about the Bible and ask them to
[4:02] substantiate, they do everything they
[4:05] can eventually accuse me of do. You know
[4:09] what they do while I ask them those
[4:12] questions is they do exactly what they
[4:15] accuse me of in defending the prophet.
[4:18] So what I'm basically seeing is they're
[4:20] trying to defend the Bible and their
[4:22] faith in the way that they expected me
[4:24] not to defend the message. So it's
[4:27] really quite hypocritical.
[4:29] But they claim because it's the Bible
[4:32] which is greater than the message and
[4:35] that they are allowed to use whatever
[4:37] methods possible and that there's no um
[4:41] um they're shamelessly will will use
[4:44] exactly the same methods of arguing and
[4:47] even worse I would say because because
[4:51] they believe William Brham is a liar, a
[4:53] false prophet, he's trash and much more.
[4:57] And then when they can't win, they go to
[5:00] attacking me and my dad personally,
[5:03] which then causes the debate to break
[5:05] down because I don't even get upset when
[5:07] they do that. I don't respond. I don't
[5:09] re react. And it proves just one thing.
[5:14] They came into a discussion with me
[5:16] prepared to attack me personally and I'm
[5:18] not doing that back to them. And it also
[5:21] shows they went around and investigated
[5:24] me, you know, and uh spoke to reliable
[5:27] people um reliable people who will
[5:31] fabricate and lie about us and um
[5:34] because I don't care for personal
[5:36] attacks and I look past whatever they
[5:39] attack me with and focus on the point.
[5:41] Stay with the point. Stay with the word.
[5:43] It just breaks down.
[5:46] So we focus on the word. So debating
[5:49] people who just love to seek uh to
[5:53] destroy people, to shame, to discredit
[5:56] is just not worth the time and the
[5:58] effort. Okay. Then there was, you know,
[6:01] concern about
[6:03] uh those leaving the message. So
[6:06] apparently it's been said that I'm not
[6:10] targeting the real reasons why people
[6:12] are leaving the message.
[6:15] uh and I was a little confused because
[6:18] how can I accurately know this for each
[6:20] person? How can I know the reason for
[6:23] each person leaving the message? It
[6:25] would just be generalizations.
[6:27] Of course, there are reasons I can give
[6:29] reasons that are biblical because we
[6:31] know that these things have to be they
[6:34] are not just leaving the message people.
[6:36] There are people leaving Christianity in
[6:39] droves. If you go to the churches here
[6:41] in Durban, and I mean Anglican,
[6:44] Presbyterian,
[6:45] uh, Catholic,
[6:47] all kinds of churches,
[6:49] uh, old Orthodox established churches
[6:53] that used to be here for 200 years or
[6:56] more, they're empty. There's nobody
[6:58] there. The churches are being sold and
[7:01] being bought off by Muslims here in
[7:02] Durban City. Um, churches are emptying
[7:06] all over the world. And the only ones
[7:07] that seem to be sustaining very large
[7:10] numbers are those who are extremely
[7:13] liberal,
[7:14] who use worship as entertainment, and
[7:17] who preach a really watered down
[7:19] message.
[7:21] Um, so I just want to make this clear. I
[7:24] was not answering the question of why
[7:27] people are leaving the message. I was
[7:30] answering the concerns of confused young
[7:32] people who are considering leaving the
[7:35] message based on things they read online
[7:39] uh in these websites and uh I was
[7:42] addressing the concerns of parents who
[7:44] have children who are either in the
[7:46] situation or have left the message. I
[7:50] just want to say from the from the uh
[7:52] outset I'm not bothered by the reason
[7:55] that people leave the message at all.
[7:57] We're not trying to get the whole world
[7:59] into the message. People must do as they
[8:02] choose, right? We are not here to
[8:04] promote a message denomination or
[8:07] achieve the greatest or largest church
[8:09] in the world. We know that's not what
[8:13] God wants us to do. So, it's very
[8:15] simple. Let him that is holy be holy
[8:17] still and he that is filthy be filthy
[8:19] still. It's not my words. It's the end
[8:21] of the book of Revelations. That is the
[8:23] prophecy of the end time.
[8:26] So in the last or rather in the last
[8:30] week since last Wednesday's message the
[8:34] first part of this discouraged by the
[8:36] prophet and message I have received all
[8:39] kinds of good messages from believers
[8:41] all over expressing thanks and
[8:44] encouragement but also cries for help.
[8:49] those with cries for help seem to be in
[8:52] dire situations where they are not
[8:54] getting answers from the church leaders
[8:56] or elders or or sometimes parents.
[9:00] And um I just want to say that while I
[9:04] I'm willing to help anybody in need of
[9:06] guidance, I must confess I do not view
[9:10] myself as somebody who has all the
[9:12] answers for you. Neither do I have all
[9:15] the right answers for you. I just have
[9:18] the view or the inspiration God has
[9:20] given me and I'm willing to share that.
[9:22] But I cannot answer every single
[9:25] question or have every answer. It's not
[9:27] just not going to happen or satisfy
[9:29] everybody.
[9:31] I do not see myself as someone with the
[9:33] authority on the word for all message
[9:36] people. I am not doing this for
[9:39] popularity or gain.
[9:42] I have been doing this personally with
[9:45] youth for the last two decades at youth
[9:47] camps, meetings, by telephone and in
[9:51] person. Um, however,
[9:54] we decided to do this last year to
[9:59] really get this going last year when I
[10:01] returned from the USA in Canada.
[10:04] Um because there have been so many
[10:06] reaching out to us and because we became
[10:09] aware that since COVID pandemic
[10:10] lockdowns almost all youth in the
[10:13] message are connected to the internet
[10:15] and social media and I know that doing
[10:19] this online does not bring me any
[10:21] personal gain. In fact, it brings me
[10:23] more pain. Notoriety and infamy is not
[10:27] something I enjoy and nor should anyone
[10:29] enjoy it. I enjoy I enjoyed a quiet
[10:32] peaceful anonymous life under the radar
[10:36] for a very long time in the message. But
[10:39] now because I have children and two
[10:43] adult children who are part of this new
[10:46] generation,
[10:47] I feel that if there is so much that the
[10:50] youth are reading online that is
[10:52] negative, that is against the word, that
[10:54] is against the message, that is against
[10:56] us, that before my time expires, I want
[10:59] to do all I can to put in their space
[11:04] what is on the side of the word to
[11:06] balance the scales. That's all I'm
[11:08] doing, right? Those are my intentions. I
[11:11] don't aim to speak with irrational
[11:14] emotions. Uh, forgive me. I'm South
[11:17] African.
[11:19] We are still getting there to the woke
[11:22] world, but I don't think it's going to
[11:24] happen anytime soon. We are rough around
[11:26] the edges. We we um say it like it is.
[11:30] We sometimes say it like it shouldn't be
[11:32] said. And this is just our makeup here
[11:36] in South Africa. We laugh at ourselves.
[11:37] We laugh at each other. We mock one
[11:39] another. Uh and we love one another at
[11:42] the same time. It's it's craziness, but
[11:44] this is our nation.
[11:46] So, uh I don't I also being that way, I
[11:50] don't want to speak so carefully that I
[11:53] don't offend anybody. I just want to
[11:56] speak from my heart and let the Holy
[11:57] Spirit do the rest. And hey, you know,
[12:00] these people online have called the
[12:04] prophet a liar, a false prophet. They
[12:07] call him trash. They call us cult
[12:10] leaders. Um they call us cult pastors.
[12:13] They call us all kinds of um names. So,
[12:17] you know, if I'm going to say something
[12:18] that's going to be provocative,
[12:22] insulting, or hurtful, well, then they
[12:24] must put on their big boy pants and take
[12:26] it as good as they give it, right?
[12:29] So I've received many comments
[12:33] um you know that were made uh on the
[12:37] YouTube channel that obviously get
[12:39] passed to me and with and others
[12:42] questions. So um and requests to explain
[12:47] particular things that was said against
[12:49] the prophet and the message but it's
[12:52] it's too much to do and I will struggle
[12:55] to have time. I'm just hoping this is
[12:57] the last segment on this series so I can
[12:59] just get back to the book of Genesis uh
[13:02] that we were the series on the book of
[13:03] Genesis. Someone also posted me a video
[13:06] of a brother who has left a message in
[13:08] which I must say he very eloquently and
[13:12] respectfully expressed his thoughts and
[13:14] reasons for leaving the message. I've
[13:16] never met the brother personally, but I
[13:18] was told that this video and several
[13:21] others in this series was responsible
[13:24] for discouraging some young people
[13:28] in that particular church and even cause
[13:31] them to leave.
[13:33] So, you know, I don't feel the leading
[13:35] to dispute the man, but I will certainly
[13:39] address some of the concerns that were
[13:42] addressed in there, which some of it
[13:44] really surprised me to be honest.
[13:47] However, it seems fortunate that someone
[13:50] on the YouTube comments posted a good
[13:52] list of grievances for us to follow. And
[13:55] I like it because it gives us a kind of
[13:58] skeleton with which we can put some
[14:00] flesh around. and um they claimed that
[14:04] these are the core problems with our
[14:06] argument. In other words, the last
[14:07] segment we did on Wednesday um they
[14:10] responded to that and um so I would like
[14:14] to address some of the major
[14:16] controversies once again by not
[14:19] defending them because I believe they
[14:22] were meant to be and that's what you
[14:24] young people need to understand. So you
[14:27] you're discouraged by the prophet and
[14:29] the message because of what you're
[14:32] reading online and because of what
[14:33] you're watching with people while
[14:35] leaving the message. And I'll say it
[14:38] again, God chose brother Brham that
[14:41] particular vessel with all those faults
[14:44] and failures and grammatical issues and
[14:49] and all over the place brain whatever
[14:51] you want to say. He chose him for the
[14:54] exact reason that it is playing out
[14:57] exactly as it should be right now. This
[14:59] is no mistake. God foresaw it. God knew
[15:02] it. God knew what was going to happen.
[15:06] So I'm not going to defend anything that
[15:09] he said or that happened in his life. I
[15:12] am addressing the controversies only in
[15:15] a way to show the wisdom behind it and
[15:18] also that when you uh read the things
[15:23] that they say like I pointed out last
[15:26] week
[15:27] um they don't realize that every
[15:30] accusation they made has been made
[15:32] against Christ, the disciples, the
[15:34] apostles
[15:35] and almost every man of God that spoke
[15:38] the truth. Right? In fact, most of those
[15:41] people throughout the ages, throughout
[15:44] Christianity, people who preached safe
[15:48] on the level
[15:50] uh non-controversial
[15:52] stuff, they just went disappeared into
[15:55] oblivion. Nobody knows anything about
[15:59] them. Very few people even follow um the
[16:03] word that they preached. It's just
[16:06] those people who actually brought the
[16:08] truth were the ones who are constantly
[16:10] brought to the forefront and criticized.
[16:13] So that's what it is. So let's begin
[16:16] with this comment from the YouTube
[16:18] channel which very nicely gives us like
[16:20] I said a skeleton to put flesh around.
[16:23] And I just want to say I don't know the
[16:25] person who wrote this. My comments will
[16:28] not be personal against that person, but
[16:31] it's going to be reacting to the whole
[16:33] because every single thing this person
[16:35] has written is what I've heard from
[16:38] every other person that I've spoken to
[16:40] who's left the message. It's like the
[16:44] same points like as if you're speaking
[16:46] to a, you know, a 7-day Adventist who's
[16:50] going to tell you about the Sabbath.
[16:52] Like they're taught step by step by step
[16:54] by step how to tell you. It's exactly
[16:56] the same thing. It's identical to what
[16:58] you're going to hear from any anti-
[17:00] message person who has been influenced
[17:02] by Believe the Sign and who has taken
[17:04] the time to study the website and fill
[17:08] their head with this knowledge. It's
[17:10] exactly that. So, let's go ahead and
[17:12] share the first part.
[17:15] They say, "Here are the core problems
[17:19] plainly stated. You don't understand
[17:22] because you lack revelation." In other
[17:24] words, they're quoting my statement from
[17:26] last week where Jesus said, "You do not
[17:29] understand. You do not understand my
[17:31] words because you do not even hear my
[17:33] words." Right? So, I said it means you
[17:36] don't understand what I'm saying to you
[17:38] because you lack revelation of what I'm
[17:40] saying to you. And this person is saying
[17:43] it is circular reasoning.
[17:46] It's so funny. Uh this, you know, the
[17:51] Bible is true because the Bible says so.
[17:53] That's circular reasoning. It's exactly
[17:55] what they will say to you. This argument
[17:59] immunizes the message from all
[18:01] criticism.
[18:02] Any disagreement, see now this is like
[18:05] putting words in her mouth. It's really
[18:06] foolish. Any disagreement is defined as
[18:09] spiritual blindness by default. That is
[18:13] not biblical reasoning. Biblical
[18:15] reasoning. Wow. Scripture repeatedly
[18:18] commands believers to test prophets.
[18:21] really a claim that cannot be questioned
[18:24] is not faith, it is insulation.
[18:28] Okay.
[18:30] So
[18:32] um
[18:34] I like the way it's uh how a lot of the
[18:37] message people who leave suddenly become
[18:39] educated on how to argue and so on. It's
[18:43] quite amazing. So these are literally
[18:46] the words of Christ.
[18:49] That's what I said. You don't understand
[18:51] my words even because you cannot hear my
[18:55] words. These this is the words of Christ
[18:58] is Christ using circular reasoning.
[19:02] It is circular reasoning to prove the
[19:04] Bible and Christ by saying the Bible
[19:07] says so. Right? That's what Christians
[19:10] are accused of. These are intellectual
[19:13] arguments that are pointless. No one is
[19:16] immunizing the message from criticiz
[19:18] from criticism. See this is like putting
[19:21] words in our mouth. We are not
[19:22] immunizing the message from all
[19:24] criticism. We welcome criticism but we
[19:27] reserve the right to tell the truth to
[19:29] those who believe the message. Right? So
[19:33] question and test the prophets all you
[19:35] want to. But know that what you are
[19:38] doing know what you are doing and be
[19:41] consistent in your criticism. also be
[19:45] better that those than those who
[19:47] criticize Christ also
[19:51] uh unless you are absolutely sure that
[19:55] God has shown this to you, you know that
[19:58] he is a false prophet
[20:01] and a a uh um and a liar and God has if
[20:07] you are not sure that God has absolutely
[20:09] shown this to you that the Holy Spirit
[20:10] has revealed to you then don't say those
[20:13] makes that's really not even Christian,
[20:17] right? It's not even the way uh a
[20:19] Christian should behave.
[20:22] Okay, I don't want to spend too much of
[20:25] time on that. Let's go to the next um
[20:29] the next grievance. Okay, number two.
[20:32] Equating criticism of William Brham with
[20:35] criticism of Jesus Christ is a false
[20:38] equivalence.
[20:40] A false equivalence. Jesus is the
[20:42] standard by which prophets are judged.
[20:45] He is not a peer prophet subject to the
[20:47] same category of evaluation.
[20:50] Scripture evaluates prophets.
[20:53] What prophets do not redefine scriptures
[20:57] standards. Collapsing that distinction
[21:00] quietly elevates brennam beyond
[21:02] accountability. Oh my goodness.
[21:06] Okay.
[21:08] you know uh
[21:13] I don't understand how this is false
[21:15] equivalence
[21:17] um you know okay so this person I don't
[21:20] know if they're in the university or
[21:22] they learn to argue using the whole
[21:25] study of fallacies and all that perhaps
[21:27] because they're talking about false
[21:29] equivalence which which when you're in
[21:31] university or college you learn about
[21:34] arguments and how to you know when
[21:36] you're in a debate or something you
[21:38] learn about different things that that
[21:40] you can identify an argument. So a false
[21:43] equivalence is like basically
[21:47] uh like comparing apples and oranges.
[21:49] That's what they're saying. So it's like
[21:52] you can't compare William Brandham to
[21:54] Christ because it's like it's like
[21:56] comparing apples and oranges.
[21:59] Um so I don't understand what they're
[22:01] saying. is is what we said is it because
[22:05] they're different people
[22:07] right the many criticism but what were
[22:10] we saying we were equating the criticism
[22:14] to the criticism right and many of the
[22:18] criticisms against brother man is
[22:20] exactly the same as the criticisms
[22:22] against Christ that's what we were
[22:24] showing you and it's it was made by the
[22:28] similar spirits in different people how
[22:30] is this false equivalent.
[22:33] No matter how you can articulate this to
[22:36] people in the most simplest way, people
[22:39] don't fail to amaze me at how
[22:40] disingenuous they can be. Not because
[22:42] they are at heart disingenuous. It's
[22:45] just because they choose to be because
[22:48] unfortunately their hearts are ruled by
[22:50] hate and because they have no proper
[22:52] argument.
[22:54] So answer my question. Don't deflect.
[22:58] Was Christ, John the Baptist, and the
[23:01] apostles proven as false because of all
[23:04] the accusations made against him? And
[23:08] should we no longer listen to their
[23:10] word? Answer the questions. Was John the
[23:13] Baptist, Malachi 4:5, and 6, did he turn
[23:16] the hearts of the children back to the
[23:17] fathers? Because that's the argument you
[23:19] made. It's not what we said. It's you.
[23:22] You said those things. You said brother
[23:25] Madam lied about being me Malachi 45 and
[23:28] 6. So did John the Baptist turn the
[23:31] hearts of the children back to the
[23:32] fathers and the fathers to the children?
[23:34] Did was the day of John the Baptist or
[23:37] thereafter was it the great and dreadful
[23:39] day of the Lord?
[23:41] Explain yourselves. Don't just sling out
[23:44] things to say William Brandham is false.
[23:46] He lied about this. He lied about that.
[23:48] Explain it. Tell us what you got. Right?
[23:53] So let's make this clear for
[23:55] kindergarten kids, right?
[23:58] By comparing the accusations made
[24:00] against the prophet with the accusations
[24:04] against Christ. Some of you in the
[24:05] message might have said, "Brother
[24:07] Alistister, how can you how can you go
[24:09] and say, you know, these are the
[24:11] accusations? How can you reveal that
[24:13] accusations against Christ and say speak
[24:15] about him uh speaking about this
[24:18] generation shall not pass?" How can you
[24:20] do that? You know, you're you're putting
[24:21] more doubt into the minds of our kids.
[24:24] What are you doing with your kids? Not
[24:26] teaching them the gospel. This is the
[24:28] real world. When you get to university,
[24:31] that's the first thing they hit them
[24:32] with, right? Are you not preparing your
[24:36] kids? Are you not doing stuff like this
[24:38] in family altars? Are you not discussing
[24:40] these things? What is this just news
[24:42] happened to break now for you? Okay. So
[24:45] what I'm saying to you is by comparing
[24:47] the accusations against the prophet with
[24:49] the accusations against Christ, I am I I
[24:53] want to say this clear. I am not saying
[24:56] that brother Brandham is Christ or
[24:59] greater than Christ. Stop it. Stop being
[25:03] deliberately stupid and trigger happy
[25:06] and listen with a good heart. It's not
[25:08] difficult for me to be respectful
[25:10] because I am respectful. I respect the
[25:12] people who criticize brother Baron as
[25:14] well as those who criticize Christ. I
[25:16] can have a full-on argument with
[25:18] somebody who is criticizing Christ.
[25:20] Someone who's an atheist and I'll never
[25:23] get angry with them. They can swear
[25:25] Jesus Christ. They can curse at they can
[25:28] curse at me. They can curse at our
[25:29] prophet. I do not even get so angry that
[25:34] my face goes red. I just do not react. I
[25:36] I remain respectful. Stick with the
[25:38] point. Right.
[25:41] In my hometown, in here in this city of
[25:44] Durban, I live at peace with all people
[25:46] of all beliefs. Scripture, here's here's
[25:49] something that's wrong.
[25:52] Scripture does not evaluate prophets.
[25:55] Where do these things come from? People
[25:58] evaluate prophets by how they interpret
[26:01] scripture and by what they think
[26:03] scripture says prophets should be. Yet I
[26:08] found that most people don't even
[26:10] understand. Most of these people, these
[26:12] people who come against brother Brandham
[26:14] don't even understand prophets and they
[26:17] don't even understand how God works with
[26:18] prophets. ALL THEY KNOW IS Deuteronomy
[26:20] 18 and um mark a prophet whose word
[26:24] doesn't come true. That's all you know.
[26:26] And yet you don't go to the entire
[26:28] Bible, right? Uh let me give you an
[26:31] example. Okay, there is a story of two
[26:34] prophets in first kings 13 during the
[26:38] time of King Jeroboam, right? It's one
[26:40] of the craziest stories you hear in the
[26:42] Bible. You you actually don't know why
[26:44] it's there, but let let me tell you,
[26:46] right? So Jeroboam is this king who
[26:48] wickedness stepped into his kingdom and
[26:50] so on and he was doing some sacrifice
[26:53] and whatever and here comes this young
[26:55] prophet who's got a word from the Lord
[26:57] and he speaks a prophecy and condemns
[27:00] what is going on and brings a prophecy
[27:02] for the future of Israel. Right? And
[27:06] then Jeroboam now is terrified. So he's
[27:09] uh he speaks to his prophet and says
[27:11] look come in come into my palace. Let's
[27:13] have something to eat. Let's uh talk
[27:15] about this. He wants to he wants him to
[27:17] change the prophecy and he wants to like
[27:19] get this prophet on his good side,
[27:21] right? And this prophet tells him, "I'm
[27:23] sorry. I was literally told by God not
[27:27] to accept any money, any food, any drink
[27:30] from anybody, but to come here and say
[27:32] what I have to and go on my way and not
[27:35] to be entertained by anybody."
[27:38] Right? And then you know what happens?
[27:40] Um there is an old prophet in the region
[27:43] that means uh he was a a true prophet an
[27:46] older one who previously served the
[27:49] kingdom and his sons or in other words
[27:52] his followers and so on came and told
[27:54] him the prophecy of this young prophet.
[27:57] So he said well I I need to go meet with
[28:00] this guy. So uh you know settle me up
[28:03] and ask and let's let's go let's go meet
[28:05] this guy. So this prophet goes to this
[28:08] um this he meets this young prophet and
[28:10] says hey I'm a prophet you know and um
[28:14] how you doing and whatever whatever and
[28:16] says listen come on come home let's go
[28:19] let's go have some food and wine and
[28:21] let's fellowship about this let's talk
[28:23] about this and his young prophet said no
[28:25] I'm sorry I uh I cannot do this this is
[28:29] what God has told me I cannot stop
[28:31] anywhere I've got to go on my way I
[28:32] can't accept food money or drink or
[28:35] whatever Just got to keep going. And
[28:37] this old prophet says, "I am also a
[28:40] prophet. And an angel came to me and
[28:43] told me a message from God that you must
[28:46] come to my house and uh come and eat
[28:50] with me and rest and sleep overnight and
[28:52] be refreshed and then go on your
[28:54] journey." I'm just dramatizing,
[28:56] paraphrasing it, right? And yet I want
[28:58] to save time.
[29:00] So
[29:01] um in this of course the this young
[29:05] prophet um accepts he goes to this old
[29:08] prophet's house and the next day he
[29:10] leaves and uh or he sleeps over the next
[29:13] day he leaves and on the way he is
[29:14] killed by a lion
[29:17] right now. Uh so the old prophet finds
[29:22] out that this young prophet was killed
[29:23] by the lion and then what he does is he
[29:26] goes there and he uh uh he goes and
[29:30] checks this whole thing out and they
[29:32] bury this this young prophet and so on
[29:34] and then he feels bad about what he did
[29:37] and then he tells his sons listen when I
[29:40] die you will bury me next to the bones
[29:42] of this young prophet and he says I want
[29:45] to tell you that what this prophet
[29:46] prophesied is the truth.
[29:49] Okay. Now, in this story, the Bible
[29:53] calls them both prophets. Right? This is
[29:56] what I want you to understand, young
[29:57] people, is the nature of prophets and
[30:00] what God makes them do.
[30:03] Both were true prophets of God used by
[30:06] God in their time. They are true
[30:09] prophets of Israel. The young prophet
[30:12] had just given a true prophecy to King
[30:14] Jeroboam. It was given instructions by
[30:16] God which he intended to follow.
[30:20] The old prophet lied to trap the young
[30:23] prophet
[30:25] and the young prophet is killed by the
[30:27] lion and the old prophet admits to his
[30:29] fault and proclaims that the young
[30:31] prophet's prophecy was true. So what are
[30:34] the questions you should be asking here?
[30:38] So let's go. Why did God allow the young
[30:41] prophet to be killed for listening to
[30:43] the old prophet?
[30:46] Why didn't God kill the old prophet for
[30:48] lying to the younger one?
[30:52] This is the most important question.
[30:54] Didn't God know this was going to
[30:56] happen?
[30:58] Or did God tell him not to accept food,
[31:01] money, or drink knowing this was going
[31:04] to happen? this. Of course, of course,
[31:08] God knew. It absolutely looks like God
[31:10] set him up because, you know, but but
[31:13] man has free will. Either one of them,
[31:15] both young prophet and old prophet could
[31:17] have chosen to do the right thing,
[31:19] right? But God knew this was going to
[31:22] happen. God knew the young prophet was
[31:25] going to be killed.
[31:27] So, did God tell him not to accept food,
[31:31] money, uh, or drink knowing this was
[31:34] going to happen?
[31:37] Of course, God knew it's going to
[31:38] happen. So, what does the story tell
[31:40] you? No matter how irresponsible or
[31:43] unrighteously these prophets acted, what
[31:47] was more important than the prophets
[31:50] themselves was the word that the
[31:52] prophets brought. Even though the one
[31:55] lied which was a stupid thing to do
[32:00] and the other one listened
[32:02] to the other prophet
[32:05] uh disobeying what God told him to do
[32:08] irrespective of what the prophets did
[32:12] the prophecy still remained the word
[32:16] still remained so this is I'm saying
[32:20] this they're saying that scripture
[32:22] evaluates prophets These are prophets.
[32:25] There are prophets all over the world
[32:27] who did crazy things, right? Uh are they
[32:32] supposed to be called false prophets
[32:33] because they did stuff like this?
[32:36] What are you saying? Right? So if you
[32:40] lived in that time of these two
[32:43] prophets, would you spend precious time
[32:46] fussing about the righteousness of the
[32:48] young prophet or the righteousness of
[32:50] the older prophet and the credibility of
[32:52] either one of the men or would you pay
[32:54] attention to the prophecy that was
[32:55] given?
[32:57] Think on that a while while we go to the
[33:00] next point and I will tell you more
[33:01] about prophets later. So let's go and
[33:05] share
[33:06] uh the next point.
[33:08] It's incredible, right?
[33:12] Okay. Point number three. Jesus was
[33:14] accused too. So, he's quoting us, right?
[33:17] Jesus was accused too. Does not make all
[33:20] accusations meaningless.
[33:23] Ancient slander without evidence is not
[33:25] the same as modern document-based
[33:27] criticism with named witnesses,
[33:30] recordings, dates, and internal
[33:32] contradictions. calling everything the
[33:34] same persecution avoids dealing with the
[33:38] substance. So it's basically saying like
[33:41] um all the accusations against Christ
[33:44] were and John the Baptist were ancient
[33:47] slander without evidence and that the
[33:50] things brought against William Brandham
[33:52] has evidence. It has documents. It has
[33:55] witnesses dates. It's got it's like
[33:59] foolproof, right?
[34:01] and calling it the same
[34:04] uh is saying, "Well, because it's the
[34:06] same, we don't have to deal with the
[34:08] situation." That's what they're saying.
[34:10] That's what they're accusing us of
[34:11] doing. So,
[34:14] there's one thing here that I I agree
[34:16] with the person on. Accusations are not
[34:19] meaningless. So, he says, "Jesus was
[34:23] accused too does not make all
[34:24] accusations meaningless." No, no, no,
[34:26] no. I agree with you, sir. Accusations
[34:29] are not meaningless. They are
[34:30] purposeful. They are meant to be. They
[34:34] are they are done with God's knowledge.
[34:36] God knew this was going to happen. We
[34:38] are not afraid of criticisms and
[34:40] accusations or even crucifixions of cult
[34:44] pastors online. We're not afraid. Bring
[34:46] it on. These are necessary for men to be
[34:49] brought down and for the word to remain.
[34:52] We are fully aware as all people of the
[34:56] Bible that we have to be brought down.
[34:58] We have to be cut down. We have to be
[35:00] shamed. We have to be criticized. We
[35:02] have to be persecuted. We know this. We
[35:05] don't walk around with our heads in
[35:07] clouds. We know this. And the reason why
[35:11] accusations are not meaningless and why
[35:13] they have to be there is so that men are
[35:16] brought down so the word remains.
[35:21] Men must never be above the word. But it
[35:24] is disingenuous on the parts of those of
[35:26] you who are anti- William Brandom,
[35:29] expecting the highest standard of
[35:31] accountability
[35:33] for him and yet you have no way of doing
[35:36] the same when it comes to everybody else
[35:39] in the Bible. So what are modern day
[35:44] document documentbased criticism with
[35:48] named witnesses, recordings, dates,
[35:51] internal contradiction? What is all
[35:52] this? This happened in every age with
[35:55] every single messenger, with every
[35:57] preacher. It's just you don't have those
[35:59] those things anymore because they've
[36:01] disappeared over 2,000 years, right? You
[36:04] don't have them. Doesn't mean it didn't
[36:06] happen, right? We know Paul was put in
[36:09] court. Paul was imprisoned. Peter and
[36:12] them were beheaded.
[36:14] Almost every uh messenger or or preacher
[36:19] or teacher of the Bible throughout
[36:21] history has been accused. Did you know
[36:23] that? Right. So this happened in every
[36:27] single age. Do not act like the scale at
[36:31] which William Brandham is criticized was
[36:33] never ever experienced before. He's the
[36:35] worst. Simply because we are in an age
[36:38] where you have documents, emails,
[36:40] WhatsApp, social media, ways of
[36:43] preserving documents. Come on, be
[36:45] better. Right? And again, do not deflect
[36:48] from the point. There are there were
[36:50] many accusations against Jesus. I
[36:52] brought it out last week against the
[36:55] disciples, John the Baptist, even Paul
[36:57] the Apostle. 2,000 years later, you no
[37:01] longer have witnesses for all those
[37:03] accusations brought. But if you did have
[37:07] those accusations and those witnesses
[37:09] and those documents, what would you be
[37:11] saying? What would you be saying of
[37:13] Paul?
[37:15] Right? If you were in the crowds when
[37:17] they brought witness against Jesus
[37:19] Christ regarding taxes, things he
[37:22] allegedly said against Rome, things his
[37:24] disciples were doing, which side would
[37:27] you be on with absolute evidence being
[37:31] presented to Pontius Pilate, witness
[37:34] testimony, documents, and the like.
[37:37] Which side would you be on? I know what
[37:39] you say. You think you'd be on Christ's
[37:42] side now after the fact, 2,000 years
[37:44] later. But listen to yourselves and look
[37:47] at what you're doing.
[37:50] Okay,
[37:52] let's share the next point. Faith is not
[37:55] belief in spite of evidence. Biblical
[37:59] faith is trust grounded in testimony,
[38:03] witnesses, and fulfilled prophecy.
[38:06] Redefining faith as refusing
[38:09] verification
[38:10] directly contradicts the way scripture
[38:13] itself argues for truth.
[38:17] I'm sorry. This is completely false.
[38:21] Faith is absolutely in spite of
[38:24] evidence. Faith is the substance.
[38:27] Evidence is not the substance. Faith is
[38:30] the substance. Faith is the evidence of
[38:32] things unseen.
[38:35] Our church knows that I often say this
[38:37] to them. If you find all the evidence
[38:40] you can dig up all histories, do
[38:43] everything, all evidence of a girl you
[38:46] are attracted to, you'll never marry her
[38:49] because you will never have faith in
[38:51] her. Evidence produces more doubt. Why
[38:55] does evidence produce more doubt?
[38:57] Because you are searching for the
[38:58] evidence with the intent to satisfy
[39:01] doubt, not belief.
[39:04] If you believed in someone, why would
[39:06] you search for evidence to prove your
[39:08] belief?
[39:10] I I don't understand. How are we even
[39:12] Christians in talking about this that we
[39:15] need evidence to believe? Do you need
[39:16] evidence to believe Christ? That's what
[39:18] I spoke about last week, right? If you
[39:21] go looking for something to prove to you
[39:24] why you should not marry this girl, the
[39:27] reason is because you have fear. You
[39:30] have insecurity and you don't want to
[39:32] make a mistake that's going to endanger
[39:34] your future.
[39:36] With that perspective, you are going to
[39:38] find something. You are going to find
[39:40] something. If you go looking for
[39:42] something on this girl, she's beautiful.
[39:44] She's charming. She's attractive. She's
[39:47] talkative just the way you like her. But
[39:49] hey,
[39:51] you got insecurities. You've got fears.
[39:54] You don't know if she'll cheat on you.
[39:56] You want to go search up a history. You
[39:58] want to go question people from a
[39:59] church. You want to go question of
[40:01] things. When you go to do that, you are
[40:04] going to find things. You are going to
[40:06] find jealous people who liked her
[40:09] quietly and want to stop you from ever
[40:11] marrying. You're going to find liars.
[40:13] You're going TO FIND YOU'RE GOING to
[40:14] find something and probably many things
[40:17] that's going to set off red flags for
[40:19] you. You are going to be increased with
[40:22] doubt and then you're going to go back
[40:25] to her and you're going to question her
[40:26] and you're going to you're going to ask,
[40:27] "Well, look, this is what somebody
[40:28] said." and and uh because it's going to
[40:31] look like she's trying to make herself
[40:35] look good in your eyes when she explains
[40:37] to you and you're going to feel like h
[40:41] I'm listening to her, you know, oh she's
[40:44] so beautiful but something is not right
[40:46] and I'm you know then what's going to
[40:48] happen is she's going to come become
[40:50] increasingly disappointed in you because
[40:53] she believes she's telling you the truth
[40:55] and you're not believing her. In her
[40:57] mind, she's going to she's going to try
[40:59] to tell you the truth about this
[41:01] evidence that you found. And you are not
[41:04] wholly accepting her experience
[41:07] and she starts becoming closer and
[41:09] closer to deciding that you are not even
[41:12] worth the trouble.
[41:14] Yes, both of you may have been great for
[41:17] each other and if you just had faith in
[41:19] each other and believe that you could
[41:21] build a future together despite the
[41:23] past, you could have been wonderful
[41:25] together.
[41:27] Faith is absolutely in spite of
[41:30] evidence. It's literally a principle of
[41:34] Christ as we read in the beginning.
[41:38] So let's let's share that again.
[41:41] uh we all know the scripture so well but
[41:43] I read in the beginning this is Jesus
[41:46] saying unto him that is Thomas because
[41:49] remember Thomas was being told that
[41:50] Jesus is risen the resurrection has
[41:52] taken place and and Thomas says I will
[41:55] never believe it unless I see it in
[41:57] other words I will never believe unless
[41:59] I have evidence these are the words of
[42:02] Jesus blessed are they that have not
[42:05] seen and yet have believed
[42:09] right and many other signs truly did to
[42:11] Jesus in the presence of his disciples
[42:13] which are not written in this book.
[42:16] Right? There's no evidence of things
[42:19] that are not written. But these are
[42:21] written that you might believe that
[42:23] Jesus is the Christ, the son of God,
[42:25] that believing you might have life
[42:27] through his name. And then of course you
[42:30] get to the scriptures where it tells you
[42:32] you are never going to believe unless
[42:34] you have the Holy Spirit. Not because of
[42:37] evidence. you there are many people who
[42:40] read the Bible and don't believe it.
[42:44] There's the evidence. You got a
[42:45] scripture that says we wrote these
[42:46] things so you might believe. And there's
[42:48] people who read it and say ah I don't
[42:51] believe it. What what is the evidence
[42:54] then? Is the evidence because the Bible
[42:56] said so? Is that the evidence? No.
[42:59] Without the Holy Spirit, you're never
[43:00] going to accept it anyway. Which means
[43:02] you need the spirit of truth to make you
[43:06] believe. And then the evidence itself
[43:08] confirms what you have first believed.
[43:13] I don't know. This is a this is a simple
[43:16] concept of scripture which I don't even
[43:19] know why we're arguing, right? It's
[43:21] craziness.
[43:23] So you may say, but hey, hold on. I know
[43:25] the other scripture where Christ said,
[43:26] "Blessed are your eyes, for they see,
[43:29] and your ears, for they hear." Again,
[43:32] don't be silly. You should know Christ
[43:34] is not talking about the same thing with
[43:36] Thomas. Christ there in that scripture
[43:38] is talking about understanding the
[43:40] mysteries of the kingdom through the
[43:42] parables that other people were never
[43:44] going to understand but the elect's eyes
[43:46] would be open to it. Okay, let's go to
[43:50] number five. Okay, number five.
[43:55] Failed prophecies are not neutral data
[43:59] points. Deuteronomy 18 does not allow
[44:03] reinterpretation, partial fulfillment.
[44:05] See, all this is all this is from those
[44:08] websites, right? Or context fixes after
[44:12] the fact. Jesus apocalyptic language has
[44:15] recognized interpretive frameworks.
[44:19] Panam's failed predictions were often
[44:21] literal, time bound, and testable. Those
[44:25] are not the same category.
[44:28] All right, this is where it starts to
[44:29] get real. I just love how they throw
[44:31] Deuteronomy 18 around without context as
[44:34] if we don't know what it says. We never
[44:35] came across it. We message believers
[44:37] never even read that part. You know,
[44:40] listen,
[44:41] it it was there because they told the
[44:46] Lord told Israel to not listen to
[44:49] prophets that were going to be in in
[44:51] Canaan,
[44:53] right? who spoke in the name of other
[44:54] gods and they were only to adhere to
[44:57] prophets that God raised from their
[44:59] brethren. Then it warned them if there
[45:02] are prophets from your brethren who
[45:05] speak in the name of other gods or said
[45:08] things that God didn't tell them to say
[45:11] in other words they used their gift to
[45:14] speak things advantageously
[45:17] to them for their own benefit which God
[45:20] did not show them. So that was what the
[45:22] whole chapter of the warning was about.
[45:24] Usually in Israel these things would
[45:26] have been proved by the yurim tumim
[45:29] right those stones in the breastplate
[45:32] that would shine when something that was
[45:34] brought that was questionable that
[45:35] needed to be checked they checked it
[45:37] with the urim the urean to meim which we
[45:41] don't have today. So what we have now
[45:48] um is after the fact internet surfers
[45:51] and researchers of information
[45:54] who collect and report uh things they
[45:57] collect things reported by people who
[45:59] did not have the Holy Ghost.
[46:02] Are we judging prophets today by
[46:04] witnesses and newspaper articles
[46:08] from people who didn't have the Holy
[46:10] Ghost? Seriously, we're doing that now,
[46:13] right? Are we supposed to accept the
[46:15] word of all these people uh above what
[46:18] the Holy Spirit tells us in our hearts?
[46:21] Is that what you as Christians are
[46:23] asking us to do?
[46:26] You know, there's this whole thing about
[46:27] the bridge scandal. I haven't uh, you
[46:31] know, read so much about it. I I get it.
[46:33] I I I don't know why what Brother Manam
[46:37] saw, why he said those things. I don't
[46:40] know what happened. I just don't know
[46:41] and I cannot cor corroborate anything
[46:44] and I don't wish to.
[46:46] Uh and yet listen, this is not a
[46:49] defense. I'm just telling you why I
[46:52] don't trust evidences from people who
[46:54] don't have the Holy Ghost. And I'm going
[46:56] to tell you this based on well
[47:00] uh that those what do they call that
[47:03] bridge? The
[47:05] the big four bridge or something. The
[47:07] other one, not the one the prophet is
[47:08] talking about, the other one. There was
[47:11] some,
[47:13] I don't know, scandal about that in
[47:15] America because there was some political
[47:17] thing. But I think that people felt like
[47:20] people were suppressing the newspapers
[47:22] were not telling the truth and they were
[47:24] suppressing the amount of deaths and the
[47:26] the American public didn't even um um
[47:32] trust what was written in the
[47:33] newspapers. Also I'll tell you here from
[47:36] South Africa during the times of aparade
[47:40] um there were plenty of people who died
[47:42] in constructions
[47:44] and because the some of the workers were
[47:48] non-white people uh people whose names
[47:51] could not be they were immigrants they
[47:53] had no ID they were their deaths were
[47:57] never reported their deaths were never
[47:59] recorded now I'm in no ways am I saying
[48:03] that this is what happened. I'm not I'm
[48:05] not doing that, okay? Not defending. I'm
[48:08] telling you why I don't trust people who
[48:11] report things because there's always an
[48:13] agenda. We know the media is corrupt. We
[48:16] know newspapers are corrupt. We know
[48:18] people are paid to report things and
[48:21] paid to be witnesses of stuff that is
[48:23] false. Why would I, who has the Holy
[48:26] Ghost, trust to report and fact check a
[48:29] prophet with people who don't? Tell me.
[48:33] Do you trust the media for everything?
[48:37] Do you do you trust witnesses who don't
[48:40] have the Holy Spirit? Do you really?
[48:43] Okay, that's dangerous
[48:46] because that's what they did in the time
[48:48] of Christ. So, Deuteronomy 18 also says
[48:53] it's it's a good warning. If a prophet
[48:55] does speak without God's authority, he
[48:57] speaks presumptuously.
[49:00] There's a history of prophets throughout
[49:03] the Bible who speak presumptuously,
[49:06] who did things God told them not to do.
[49:09] Like for example, Elisha who who made
[49:12] that she bear come and eat all his
[49:15] children.
[49:16] Did God tell him to do that? That was an
[49:19] angry prophet.
[49:21] He spoke presumptuously.
[49:23] And just so that God makes the people
[49:27] respect this man's word, God had to
[49:29] allow that she bear to come and eat
[49:30] those children.
[49:32] These are even things that atheist
[49:35] people fight with us about. How could a
[49:38] God allow a prophet to get a bear to eat
[49:42] little children? What kind of God is
[49:44] this? This is stuff we face. This is
[49:47] prophets.
[49:48] Are they checked
[49:51] by scripture?
[49:53] My goodness, people don't read the
[49:55] Bible. Honestly,
[49:57] are there records in the Bible where
[49:59] prophets were told by God to say
[50:01] something which then would never happen?
[50:04] Did you hear my question?
[50:06] Okay. So, prophets must never be wrong.
[50:09] Prophets must be checked by Deuteronomy
[50:11] 18. Prophets must whatever prophecy they
[50:13] say must come to pass or else they are
[50:16] false prophets.
[50:18] Recognize interpretive frameworks.
[50:21] What? Explain it then. Let's hear you
[50:24] anti- message people spin it. I haven't
[50:27] met one of you who can give a satisfying
[50:30] answer to the things I'm about to tell
[50:32] you. You all end up doing the same thing
[50:35] that you are accusing us of doing.
[50:37] Everything comes in when you can't
[50:39] explain yourself. Everything you accuse
[50:41] us of circular reasoning, straw man, ad
[50:44] homonym and to qui, addulum, appeal to
[50:47] authority, post hawk, eropto hog, false
[50:50] dichotomies and more. All these things
[50:53] that you learn in wherever you get it
[50:55] from. Uh if you go to college and
[50:57] university, you learn those things. So
[50:59] you bring it all here and say, "Look,
[51:00] there's what he's doing." And he stood
[51:02] there smug. This is what you're doing.
[51:04] See, literal, time bound, and testable.
[51:09] Were you there in the time of the
[51:11] prophet to tell me literal, time bound,
[51:14] and testable? Were you there as a
[51:17] personal and actual witness of the
[51:19] things that took place on those stages
[51:23] when when those healing lines were
[51:25] coming through, when those prophecies
[51:26] were made? Do you know, were you there?
[51:30] Will you at least give credence to our
[51:33] argument that you may not properly
[51:35] understand statements or prophecies and
[51:38] for the purpose they were said?
[51:42] No, you can't. Okay, so I'm going to
[51:45] throw you something. Spin this because
[51:48] you say scripture tests prophets. Okay,
[51:52] let me give you a prophet whose word
[51:54] never came to pass. Jonah 3:4.
[51:58] And Jonah began to enter into the city a
[52:01] day's journey. And he cried and said,
[52:03] "Yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be
[52:06] overthrown."
[52:10] Oh my.
[52:13] What happened here? Yeah. Let me just
[52:15] tell you what happened, right? So Jonah
[52:17] is told by God, "Go to Nineveh and
[52:19] prophesy and get these people. Tell them
[52:22] that judgment is coming." Jonah runs
[52:24] off. We know the story. He doesn't want
[52:27] He hates these people. He hates Nineveh.
[52:29] He hates Babylon. He like, "Why should I
[52:32] even go to this place and prophesy? Let
[52:34] these people die. You know, I don't care
[52:36] about them." And he runs away. And of
[52:39] course, God pulls him back and sends him
[52:41] there. We have no idea why God is doing
[52:42] this, right? And then
[52:46] now Jonah eventually learns his lesson
[52:49] of course goes there and then prophesies
[52:52] and said in 40 days Nineveh shall be
[52:56] overthrown. He went around the city
[52:58] crying and telling the people Nineveh is
[53:01] going to be you have 40 days to repent
[53:03] cuz Nineveh is going to be overthrown.
[53:06] And you know the story after 40 days
[53:09] Nineveh was never overthrown. It wasn't
[53:12] destroyed.
[53:14] It never happened. Was he false? Was
[53:18] Jonah giving a false prophecy? Why was
[53:22] Nineveh not destroyed after 40 days? Was
[53:25] he a true prophet or not? And let me
[53:27] tell you, even Jonah was upset because
[53:30] he looked like God didn't keep his word
[53:32] and he made Jonah look like a fool. You
[53:34] know what happened with Jonah going and
[53:35] sitting there under those g guards and
[53:38] uh upset,
[53:40] right? He was upset that the people uh
[53:44] repented
[53:46] and um he had been through all the
[53:48] correction of God, been through those
[53:51] seas, spent time in the the sea
[53:53] monster's belly and then he basically
[53:56] comes out here now and he is now made a
[54:00] fool. He tells them in 40 days it's
[54:02] going to be done and then it doesn't
[54:04] happen.
[54:06] That's in the Bible,
[54:09] right? This is what they're going to ask
[54:10] you. Let's go to another one. Matthew
[54:14] 16:28.
[54:16] Okay. Says, "Verily, I say unto you."
[54:19] This is Jesus saying, "There be some
[54:22] standing here which shall not taste of
[54:25] death till they see the Son of Man
[54:27] coming in his kingdom." And this is what
[54:30] I'm saying. You anti- message people. I
[54:34] like to hear you spin this, right? How
[54:37] about this one? How do you anti- William
[54:40] Brandom people argue this point? How do
[54:43] you substantiate what happened? Which
[54:45] argument type are you going to use?
[54:47] Which fallacy are you going to use? We
[54:50] know the answer. We know the answer to
[54:52] all these things because of the message.
[54:54] Imagine the message of the prophet makes
[54:58] us look at these questionable things and
[55:00] still believe. We have the answer to
[55:03] these questions because of the message.
[55:05] But how are you going to answer that?
[55:07] Right? I've had conversations with
[55:10] denominational people. I've had
[55:12] conversations with others. All other
[55:14] denominations flounder at this and
[55:17] barely can give a coherent answer. And
[55:20] anyway, no matter what answer they give,
[55:22] you can never give a satisfactory answer
[55:25] that will change the mind of an atheist
[55:27] to this to the atheist who reads the
[55:29] scripture. your evidence. Um,
[55:34] uh, Christ was false because all those
[55:36] people died and they did not see the son
[55:38] of man coming in his kingdom.
[55:41] See, so no matter what answer they give,
[55:45] it doesn't satisfy, right? And that's
[55:48] exactly how we feel about you antibrand
[55:51] people because it doesn't matter what
[55:53] answer we give, it's never going to
[55:55] satisfy you, right?
[55:57] Let's go to 1 John 2:18.
[56:01] Now again, people, this is not brother
[56:03] Alistister. What are you doing? Why are
[56:05] you making us doubt the Bible? I'm not.
[56:08] Come on, you people need to wake up. 1
[56:11] John 2:18, little children, it is the
[56:13] last time. This is John prophesying that
[56:17] the day he's living in is the end of
[56:19] days, the last time. And as you have
[56:21] heard that antichrist shall come, even
[56:24] now are there many antichrists whereby
[56:26] we know that it is the last time. So
[56:29] this is the epistles of John, right? Was
[56:33] John a liar?
[56:35] Was he a false prophet?
[56:38] Right? Here John says again something
[56:40] that can be proven as not factual.
[56:43] Right? He's he's saying this that it is
[56:46] the last day because he told us false
[56:49] Christ will arise and because many are
[56:51] already risen. That's how we know it is
[56:52] the the end of days. It's the last time,
[56:55] right? Do you not know what those
[56:58] disciples got everyone to do in the book
[57:01] of Acts?
[57:03] Because they believed. They they didn't
[57:06] make a mistake. And this is why I say I
[57:08] love to hear you spend this because
[57:10] these these disciples believed
[57:14] by the words that Christ spoke to them
[57:17] that their days was the end of days.
[57:20] They preached it. They prophesied it
[57:23] because they because they believed Jesus
[57:25] was coming in their time. Here's what
[57:28] the book of Acts, the church in the book
[57:30] of Acts made them do. Peter and all the
[57:33] disciples made them sell their houses,
[57:36] divide their goods among the church,
[57:38] leave their families, and so much more
[57:41] just because they had to work as hard as
[57:43] they could to get as many people as
[57:45] possible to believe in Christ. Many of
[57:48] those people, in fact, all of those
[57:49] people in the time of the disciples,
[57:51] including the disciples and the
[57:53] apostles, all died never having realized
[57:56] the end of days and never saw Jesus
[57:59] coming the second time. Did that prove
[58:01] that the disciples were false prophets
[58:03] and teachers?
[58:05] Does that is that proof that we must
[58:08] denounce the book of Acts, denounce
[58:10] everything Paul said, uh, denounce the
[58:12] the New Testament because it's it's what
[58:15] they said because the few statements
[58:17] they made concerning the end of days is
[58:20] proven to be wrong. Therefore, we
[58:21] shouldn't believe them.
[58:25] Maybe to some of them uh you know but to
[58:29] God the work of getting the gospel to
[58:32] the world had been done.
[58:34] Whatever he said to them
[58:37] incentivized them to go and get the
[58:40] gospel as fast as possible to the world.
[58:42] It's what they needed to hear and it's
[58:44] what was done. Whether they were
[58:47] inaccurate or whether they look like
[58:48] they are false or what was more
[58:50] important was the word that was sent.
[58:55] Go into the world preach the gospel.
[58:57] Amen. Let's go to John 1:18.
[59:01] John 1:18. No man hath seen God at any
[59:05] time. The only begotten son which is in
[59:07] the bosom of the father, he hath
[59:09] declared him.
[59:12] So John the revelator, is he
[59:14] inconsistent with the word? He says no
[59:17] man had seen God any time. And yet in
[59:19] the Bible, Jacob said he saw the Lord.
[59:24] Moses said he saw the Lord. Manoah said
[59:26] he saw the Lord. The Bible says in
[59:28] Exodus 24:9 that the 70 elders that were
[59:31] with Moses coming up to the mount beheld
[59:35] the Lord God of Israel.
[59:38] So
[59:39] why won't you read John 1:18 and say
[59:41] John was a liar? John was a false
[59:43] prophet because of this inconsistent
[59:46] words that he spoke that that brings
[59:49] discrepancy with scripture. There are
[59:50] witnesses in the Bible that prove it.
[59:52] Yes. How will you spin it people? We
[59:56] know the answer to all these things
[59:58] because WE ARE IN THE message
[1:00:00] right by the message. We don't make
[1:00:03] excuses for the Bible. We believe the
[1:00:06] Bible by revelation. You people are
[1:00:09] accusing us of placing the message above
[1:00:11] the Bible. And yet the the message makes
[1:00:14] us believe the Bible even stronger than
[1:00:16] you can. That's the thing. And it's
[1:00:20] because
[1:00:22] we believe the Bible by revelation
[1:00:24] without needing evidence and because we
[1:00:26] have the Holy Spirit. I love this next
[1:00:29] one.
[1:00:30] This is this is the ultimate one, right?
[1:00:32] because you say Jesus is the standard by
[1:00:35] which you have to judge all the
[1:00:37] prophets. Okay, let's look at another
[1:00:40] one. Matthew 12:40. This is, you know,
[1:00:44] the Lord Jesus people were asking him
[1:00:46] for a sign and he said, "The only sign
[1:00:47] you will ever have is the sign of the
[1:00:50] prophet Jonas, right?" Verse 40, Matthew
[1:00:53] 12:40.
[1:00:55] And as Jonas, that is Jonah, was three
[1:00:58] days and three nights in the whale's
[1:00:59] belly, so shall the Son of Man be three
[1:01:03] days and three nights in the heart of
[1:01:05] the earth.
[1:01:07] Three days and three nights in the heart
[1:01:09] of the earth. Notice it doesn't say
[1:01:11] three days. It says three days and three
[1:01:13] nights. Okay, we have a a massive
[1:01:17] problem here people because there is no
[1:01:20] Christian on earth today who can
[1:01:24] sufficiently explain Matthew 12:40 to an
[1:01:26] atheist especially after Jesus says this
[1:01:30] here
[1:01:32] uh in Matthew chapter 12 and then in
[1:01:35] John chapter 2 he says destroy this
[1:01:37] temple and in 3 days I will raise it up.
[1:01:40] So listen,
[1:01:42] 3 days and three nights is 72 hours,
[1:01:46] right? Is that right? Uh I don't know if
[1:01:50] I'm getting my maths right. So 24 24
[1:01:54] hours of night, 12 hours of day, 12
[1:01:56] hours of night, 12 hours of day, 12
[1:01:58] hours of night, 12 hours of day. Right?
[1:02:01] So
[1:02:03] that's the sign of the son of man.
[1:02:04] That's that's the sign that they are
[1:02:06] going to see. Jesus said that I will be
[1:02:10] in the heart of the earth. The son of
[1:02:12] man will be in the heart of the earth
[1:02:14] three days and three nights. Right? In
[1:02:17] other places he said after 3 days I will
[1:02:20] raise it up again. He says in other
[1:02:23] places on the third day. So what firstly
[1:02:26] is he contradicting himself? First he
[1:02:29] says the son of man says in three days
[1:02:31] and three nights. Now he says on the
[1:02:34] third day. So what do you say antibrand
[1:02:38] people? Was he inaccurate? Was he false?
[1:02:42] Is this the standard of evaluating
[1:02:44] prophets?
[1:02:46] Do you need evidence or no evidence? Do
[1:02:48] you believe Jesus Christ to be Christ to
[1:02:50] be the Messiah? How is he speaking
[1:02:53] inaccuracies and it what looks like even
[1:02:56] falsehoods? Because here you people who
[1:02:59] go and celebrate Easter say he died on
[1:03:03] Friday night and then he was resurrected
[1:03:05] on Sunday morning.
[1:03:08] If he died on Friday night, that's one
[1:03:09] night, one day. One night, and then he
[1:03:12] resurrected at 6:00 a.m. in the morning
[1:03:14] at the rising of the sun. That's two
[1:03:17] nights and one day. That's not three
[1:03:19] nights and three days. Spin that. The
[1:03:23] truth is we um you will never understand
[1:03:27] this unless you understand the opening
[1:03:30] of the seal, the seventh seal, right? So
[1:03:35] what do you say?
[1:03:37] We understand this because we understand
[1:03:40] the opening of the seventh seal, right?
[1:03:42] Wouldn't you like to know? No, you've
[1:03:44] denounced the seven seal. If you don't
[1:03:46] read the intunement message and
[1:03:48] understand dimensions and the seven
[1:03:51] seal, you will never truly understand
[1:03:54] this scripture and tie it in with all
[1:03:56] the other scriptures. You can't do it. I
[1:03:58] have listened to commentators from
[1:04:00] denominations try their best. I've
[1:04:03] listened to apologists try their best.
[1:04:05] I've I've listened to people eventually
[1:04:07] give up on this. You don't know it. And
[1:04:10] you anti William Brandon people, you
[1:04:12] cannot explain this. I know you can't
[1:04:14] because I've tried you already. Right?
[1:04:17] So, you'll just have to take Jesus's
[1:04:20] word for it and hope your intellectual
[1:04:22] smarts hold on long enough until you
[1:04:25] meet someone more intellectual and
[1:04:27] smarter than you, than smarter than you
[1:04:29] think you are. Just because you studied
[1:04:31] one website for more than 30 minutes,
[1:04:34] suddenly you can take the prophet to
[1:04:36] task. Okay? You can't even answer your
[1:04:38] Bible questions. you fuss about. He said
[1:04:41] 22 years and he said this wrong here and
[1:04:43] this number is wrong there. He made a
[1:04:45] mistake with this story and he was
[1:04:47] inaccurate there. The only thing he's
[1:04:49] got you doing is wasting your time
[1:04:52] trying to prove him wrong. So just stop
[1:04:54] it. Stop your silliness. And just
[1:04:57] because the only thing you properly
[1:04:59] studied for longer than 30 minutes was
[1:05:01] Legend of the Fall by Peter Dyen,
[1:05:03] believe the sign and seek you the truth.
[1:05:05] You didn't study your Bible. You didn't
[1:05:07] study the message properly. No. All you
[1:05:09] have is these sites that you spend the
[1:05:12] longest thing you've ever spent studying
[1:05:14] uh with both Bible and message is this
[1:05:17] website. And this is what you can come
[1:05:19] up with. Go read. I want to tell you
[1:05:21] now, you antibrand people, go read the
[1:05:24] book 100 False Bible Prophecies by
[1:05:28] Robert Collins. Go have your faith
[1:05:31] tested before you come and lecture us
[1:05:33] about inconsistencies and testing
[1:05:35] prophets with evidence. Go read it. 100
[1:05:40] False Bible Prophecies by Robert
[1:05:42] Collins. Go read it. I've read it. Okay,
[1:05:46] I'm good with it.
[1:05:48] A lot of this book is very much the same
[1:05:50] way you people attack us. But there are
[1:05:52] some things in there that I would pay to
[1:05:56] watch you answer in a theater while
[1:05:58] holding a huge bag of popcorn. I would
[1:06:01] seriously enjoy watching you squirm. You
[1:06:04] find yourself in the same seat you try
[1:06:07] to squash us into and all message
[1:06:09] believers trying to put us in places
[1:06:11] where you can trap us with gotcha
[1:06:12] points. Right? If you attack the prophet
[1:06:15] in the same way in a certain way while
[1:06:19] defending the Bible from him then you
[1:06:21] must be held accountable the same way
[1:06:24] when you defend the Bible from atheists.
[1:06:28] I want to just tell you, you know, we
[1:06:31] are not so weak in faith that we need
[1:06:33] evidence. We love the Lord and his
[1:06:37] servants regardless of what evidence we
[1:06:40] need or need to find or evidence that
[1:06:42] he's given. We love the Lord. We love
[1:06:45] his servants. We love the word. Amen.
[1:06:49] All right, let's share the next point.
[1:06:52] Failed ministers matter precisely
[1:06:55] because Brham claimed prophetic
[1:06:58] discernment.
[1:07:00] Judah's failing does not validate later
[1:07:03] prophets.
[1:07:05] Brham explicitly claimed supernatural
[1:07:08] insight into people's lives and futures
[1:07:11] when he repeatedly endorsed men who
[1:07:14] later collapsed morally or doctrinally.
[1:07:17] That is evidence, not persecution.
[1:07:21] Come on. Right.
[1:07:24] Oh my goodness. What are you saying
[1:07:26] again? Didn't Jesus have prophetic
[1:07:29] discernment? Didn't he have the greatest
[1:07:31] supernatural insight of all? Did he not
[1:07:35] know the 70 were going to be deceived
[1:07:37] and reject him? Why did he anoint them
[1:07:40] with the Holy Ghost and send them to
[1:07:42] cast out devils in his name and heal the
[1:07:44] sick? If he knew they're going to to
[1:07:48] reject him, why did he give them the
[1:07:50] Holy Ghost?
[1:07:52] Didn't he know they were going to reject
[1:07:53] him? What are you even saying? How could
[1:07:56] he give um unbelievers the Holy Ghost?
[1:08:00] Come on now.
[1:08:02] How could he make unbelievers who are
[1:08:04] going to reject him and add to
[1:08:06] crucifying him? How could he give them
[1:08:08] the Holy Ghost to go heal people and
[1:08:10] cast out devils in his name? Come on,
[1:08:13] you lot. Don't deflect. answer the
[1:08:15] question. These were all points the Jews
[1:08:18] used to discredit Christ exactly the
[1:08:20] same way. By the way, it's a silly
[1:08:24] argument, right? So, didn't God know
[1:08:28] which message believers were going to be
[1:08:29] used by him until they reject the
[1:08:32] message?
[1:08:35] Yeah, God knew it. Okay. All right. So,
[1:08:40] I want to maybe educate you on
[1:08:43] something. Maybe you didn't know.
[1:08:46] Um, did you know that there were
[1:08:51] accusations against men of God
[1:08:53] throughout the church ages, throughout
[1:08:56] Christendom?
[1:08:57] Right. Massive, even worse things than
[1:09:00] what you're bringing against William
[1:09:02] Brandham. Uh there was an accusation
[1:09:04] against the apostle Paul for
[1:09:06] misappropriating funds collected for the
[1:09:09] poor because he used it for himself
[1:09:11] instead of what it was supposed to be
[1:09:14] used for. There were also accusations
[1:09:17] against him which were theological
[1:09:19] discrepancies
[1:09:20] brought by the first church.
[1:09:23] Right? Even dissent amongst the
[1:09:26] disciples were trying to prove that
[1:09:28] false that Paul was was wrong and
[1:09:30] preaching false things. At least Peter
[1:09:33] had the respect to say, "Oh, precious
[1:09:36] brother Paul preaches things that we
[1:09:38] wrestle with, things that are very hard
[1:09:39] to understand." But many of the other
[1:09:42] people at the time felt, "Who are you?
[1:09:46] Why should we listen to you just because
[1:09:47] you uh you saw a pillar of fire on the
[1:09:50] way to Damascus, which nobody can
[1:09:52] prove?" There are some people there who
[1:09:54] said they heard a voice. Other people
[1:09:57] saw a light. Nobody can prove it. Then
[1:10:00] you who killed us and criticized us
[1:10:02] suddenly you you go there you get some
[1:10:04] epiphany and then you you know you you
[1:10:06] come and preach to us. Now you want to
[1:10:09] teach us the the scripture. We spent
[1:10:11] three and a half years with this man and
[1:10:13] you want to teach us. You were not even
[1:10:15] a witness of him.
[1:10:19] Okay. You can go back and read history.
[1:10:22] The founding fathers there were scores
[1:10:24] of accusations against them. theological
[1:10:27] problems, differences, scandals,
[1:10:30] whole lot of things, right? Uh how about
[1:10:34] Martin Luther? You anti-brandom people,
[1:10:37] do you respect Martin Luther? Do you
[1:10:39] believe him to be a man of God? Do you
[1:10:42] believe him to be a credible man of God?
[1:10:46] Right.
[1:10:48] Martin Luther
[1:10:50] uh has been documented and seen as the
[1:10:54] the one whose influence
[1:10:57] brought Germany to anti-semitism.
[1:11:01] Right? Uh anti-semitism in Germany is
[1:11:05] largely attributed to the influence of
[1:11:07] Martin Luther. He wrote in 1543 the
[1:11:11] triotize on the Jews and their lies.
[1:11:15] Right? He wrote hateful things about the
[1:11:17] Jews. He got Christians to persecute
[1:11:20] Jews. Luther got Christians to burn down
[1:11:23] people's synagogues and homes and
[1:11:25] collect and burn all their books and
[1:11:28] writings. Do you know Adolf Hitler
[1:11:31] constantly invoke Luther's writings in
[1:11:34] his speeches in in his testimonies? and
[1:11:37] he said Adolf Hitler says Martin Luther
[1:11:40] was a national hero of Germany and he
[1:11:44] celebrated Martin Luther's birthday in
[1:11:46] 1933. I think it must have been his
[1:11:48] 450th birthday.
[1:11:50] Was Martin Luther a bad man? Was he a
[1:11:53] man of God? This man brought the just
[1:11:56] shall live by faith. He was hailed as
[1:11:58] one of the most significant beginners of
[1:12:00] the reformation movement and broke
[1:12:03] Christians away from the hold of an
[1:12:05] abusive Catholic church. But this man
[1:12:08] was an anti-semite who wrote absolutely
[1:12:11] hateful pe things about the Jews and got
[1:12:14] the Germans to burn down synagogues and
[1:12:17] houses
[1:12:18] and persecute the Jewish people.
[1:12:22] If brother Brandham did that,
[1:12:25] wow.
[1:12:26] Well, how about John Wesley? John
[1:12:30] Wesley, the darling of the Methodist
[1:12:32] church. This man, I tell you, people
[1:12:36] people speak great things about him and
[1:12:37] he was a wonderful man. Traveled by
[1:12:39] horse horseback
[1:12:42] uh spent every moment of his life in the
[1:12:45] gospel.
[1:12:47] Do you know John Wesley fell in love
[1:12:49] with a girl in Savannah, Georgia in
[1:12:51] America on a missionary trip and this
[1:12:53] girl didn't love him back. she married
[1:12:56] somebody else. So John Wesley was so
[1:12:59] overcome with jealousy that he shamed
[1:13:02] this girl publicly and he refused to
[1:13:05] serve her holy communion in the church
[1:13:08] and the elders of the church got upset
[1:13:10] and what has been reported is that he
[1:13:13] even interfered with her marriage
[1:13:16] uh trying to upset it such that he was
[1:13:19] the church there forced him to leave
[1:13:20] America and return to England.
[1:13:23] And then he goes to England. He marries
[1:13:25] a woman whom he didn't love because he
[1:13:28] still loved this other one. Now he he
[1:13:30] married a woman whom he didn't love. And
[1:13:32] this woman physically abused John
[1:13:34] Wesley. There's reports of of someone
[1:13:37] finding him lying on the floor with his
[1:13:39] hair pulled out. Right. Uh she beat him.
[1:13:44] She beat John Wesley, who we believe is
[1:13:46] the messenger of the Philadelphia age.
[1:13:50] She she wrote fraudulent fraudulent
[1:13:52] letters in John Wesley's name and she
[1:13:55] threatened him constantly to expose him
[1:13:58] of adulteries.
[1:14:01] Do you know that in America John Wesley
[1:14:04] was accused of plagiarism?
[1:14:07] I so I'm asking you, was this man a man
[1:14:09] of God or a false prophet
[1:14:12] or a false teacher? And because of the
[1:14:15] accusations against him, we should write
[1:14:18] everything off. Write off his word.
[1:14:21] Write off everything he did.
[1:14:24] You know who John Wesley was?
[1:14:27] This was an absolute man of God. He
[1:14:30] transformed England away from the
[1:14:32] clutches of the church of the the
[1:14:36] Anglican church, the abuse and the
[1:14:37] corruption. He founded the Methodist
[1:14:40] movement, the great Methodist movement
[1:14:42] which many people say, many even the
[1:14:44] critics say saved the soul of England.
[1:14:48] John Wesley and a young man who some of
[1:14:50] you might know called William
[1:14:52] Wilberforce was credited by many and I
[1:14:55] would think not credited enough for the
[1:14:58] greatest fight against the slave trade
[1:15:02] and and William Wilberforce was very
[1:15:06] largely influenced by the ministry of
[1:15:09] John Wesley. In fact, in the last letter
[1:15:13] recorded of John Wesley
[1:15:16] would have been 6 days before um John
[1:15:20] Wesley died, he wrote these words. He
[1:15:23] said, "Go on in the name of God and in
[1:15:26] the power of his might till even
[1:15:29] American slavery, the vilest ever saw
[1:15:34] uh the sun shall vanish away before it."
[1:15:37] It's it's one of the most amazing lines
[1:15:40] written in there in his letter to
[1:15:42] William Wilberforce.
[1:15:44] This man
[1:15:46] had problems with his personal life,
[1:15:49] loved another girl, married one he
[1:15:51] didn't love, and had marital problems.
[1:15:55] Was he a man of God? Is he worthy of
[1:15:58] being a man of God? He's uh accused of
[1:16:01] plagiarism.
[1:16:04] What do we do with these things?
[1:16:06] Antibrandom people. Looking back at
[1:16:09] history, seeing the good of what the
[1:16:11] ministry of these men eventually
[1:16:12] achieved makes us overlook hot scandals
[1:16:16] and rejection they faced in their time.
[1:16:19] No matter what happened in John Wesley's
[1:16:21] personal life, I can look past that. I
[1:16:23] can look at what he did. I can look at
[1:16:25] what God achieved in his ministry. I can
[1:16:28] look past the anti-semitism of Martin
[1:16:31] Luther and look at what he did to bring
[1:16:34] people out of the cultures of the
[1:16:35] Catholic Church, right?
[1:16:39] And I don't care looking back at
[1:16:41] history, seeing the good that they did
[1:16:43] and all the scandals and rejection and
[1:16:46] accusations people brought against them
[1:16:49] at the time while they were living and
[1:16:50] even shortly after their deaths. Here's
[1:16:53] what happens. These men's names will
[1:16:56] live on as men of God who stood for
[1:16:59] their convictions in their time. I
[1:17:02] believe it's the same thing that will
[1:17:03] happen here.
[1:17:05] All the naysayers and anti-W William
[1:17:07] Brandham propagandist,
[1:17:09] listen, young people, they're going to
[1:17:10] die off soon. They won't even these guys
[1:17:13] who made up the sites, they'll die. They
[1:17:15] won't even be around. They'll disappear
[1:17:17] into oblivion. Nobody will even remember
[1:17:19] their names because nobody in the world
[1:17:21] cares to read every anything they say
[1:17:24] except those people who left the message
[1:17:26] and people who hate William Brandham.
[1:17:28] There's billions of people who will
[1:17:30] never even read the site or care what
[1:17:32] has been said. But even after they're
[1:17:34] dead and gone, the word of the prophet
[1:17:37] will still live on and it will keep
[1:17:39] changing lives of people who search for
[1:17:42] Christ and find him through the message
[1:17:44] of the hour. That's just the truth.
[1:17:47] The message is not a threat to anyone in
[1:17:49] the world. It's not even a threat to
[1:17:51] denominations and governments. They
[1:17:53] don't even care for us. Go have a look
[1:17:55] at maybe a list of the greatest threats
[1:17:57] of um you know religious threats or
[1:18:01] right-wing activists in America wherever
[1:18:04] you won't even find the message there.
[1:18:06] It's it's other denominations.
[1:18:08] Right? We are we will never have a part
[1:18:12] of the lobby among evangelicals. Neither
[1:18:15] will we be a part of any system. We will
[1:18:19] we are literally nobodies who don't make
[1:18:21] a dent anywhere in the world. So they
[1:18:23] don't care about us. So all the stuff
[1:18:25] written on sites is never even going to
[1:18:27] matter. It's never going to be
[1:18:28] remembered. Nobody's going to care about
[1:18:30] it. The squeeze of a one world system
[1:18:33] and the mark of the beast will affect
[1:18:35] all of Christianity of which we the
[1:18:38] nobodies will not take the enemy's lie.
[1:18:42] Praise be to God. Amen. Let's go to
[1:18:46] number seven. Number seven. The 1963
[1:18:50] cloud cannot be both public vindication
[1:18:53] and private meaning.
[1:18:56] Really? Okay. Firstly, says who? It can
[1:19:00] be anything God wants you to be, right?
[1:19:04] Who are you or anybody else to say that
[1:19:06] something can't be? Anyway, uh reading
[1:19:10] on. If it was used publicly as physical
[1:19:12] confirmation, it must withstand physical
[1:19:15] scrutiny. Retreating to it was only for
[1:19:19] him. Oh, is that what you took from what
[1:19:22] I said last week? It was only for him.
[1:19:25] After factual challenges arise is a move
[1:19:28] away from falsifiability,
[1:19:30] not clarification.
[1:19:33] Oh, that's good. That's really good.
[1:19:38] Uh I just want to say I absolutely agree
[1:19:41] with you here. The cloud is not public
[1:19:44] vindication. It's not. I agree. Many
[1:19:48] message people made it that way. It's
[1:19:50] not. It It's just stupidity to think
[1:19:53] that it's public vindication.
[1:19:55] It isn't because we were not there. We
[1:19:58] were not there when the publication was
[1:20:00] made. We only believe
[1:20:03] believe in it because the prophet said
[1:20:05] it and we believe the prophet's word.
[1:20:07] That's it. It's not a public vindication
[1:20:10] of anything, right? It's a vindication
[1:20:13] to him. If you understand the
[1:20:14] three-folds of the seventh seal, you'll
[1:20:16] understand why it was a vindication to
[1:20:19] him of what was being preached in March
[1:20:21] 17 to March 24th. And we are the people
[1:20:23] of the third cycle of the seventh seal.
[1:20:25] That's what we believe. Those of you who
[1:20:27] don't study the message don't know that.
[1:20:29] So you'll never understand that it did
[1:20:31] not happen in our day. So I agree with
[1:20:33] you. It's not public vindication.
[1:20:37] Uh we also don't care which elders
[1:20:41] we don't know used it for physical
[1:20:44] confirmation. I don't care which great
[1:20:47] ministers in the message used it for
[1:20:50] physical and public confirmation. I'm
[1:20:52] sorry. It doesn't matter to me what
[1:20:54] other men say. But we are not retreating
[1:20:57] from anything. See this is classic
[1:21:00] argument. We are retreating into its not
[1:21:04] it's only for him. Listen people,
[1:21:08] those of us who study the message for
[1:21:11] the word and not sensationalism have
[1:21:14] always been constant. We believe the
[1:21:17] prophet's testimony on it because we
[1:21:20] believe the word not the other way
[1:21:22] around. Okay. I have preached this long
[1:21:26] before believe the sign came up. So is
[1:21:29] my father, my dad. We So we know we are
[1:21:34] not retreating.
[1:21:35] Maybe others are, but we are not. I
[1:21:38] haven't even heard other people tell you
[1:21:40] what I told you last week, right? Have
[1:21:43] you considered See here, here's
[1:21:45] something. This is not a defense. I'm
[1:21:48] just asking you to consider. Have you
[1:21:50] considered that? And I preached this
[1:21:53] long ago. long ago, two decades ago,
[1:21:57] if God wanted to, he could use anything.
[1:22:02] And I'll say it in this thing, in this
[1:22:04] case, a formation of gases fired from a
[1:22:08] rocket to vindicate something to his
[1:22:11] prophet. Do you consider that if God
[1:22:13] wanted to do that, he would?
[1:22:16] God could use a donkey to talk to Balum.
[1:22:20] God could use a pillar of cloud to veil
[1:22:22] himself. So what's your point?
[1:22:26] What's the point? If if the the
[1:22:30] contrails of an airplane flying through
[1:22:34] the uh way above the clouds could be
[1:22:37] used by God to create some sign to
[1:22:40] vindicate something to someone down
[1:22:42] there. Is it not possible?
[1:22:45] Right. So, or is it that people are are
[1:22:50] you offended because or affected because
[1:22:53] people took the cloud and made stuff
[1:22:56] about it and because maybe William
[1:22:59] Brandham was inaccurate about the
[1:23:00] details when he told the story of him
[1:23:03] being there during that time. Um, so
[1:23:07] because he was inaccurate on the
[1:23:08] details, therefore he lied. Therefore,
[1:23:10] he's a false prophet and everything he
[1:23:12] preached from beginning to end is uh
[1:23:16] false and and and u therefore he is
[1:23:20] worthy of your absolute excoriation.
[1:23:24] Can you say that without a shadow of
[1:23:27] doubt, not even 1% of doubt, that no
[1:23:31] souls were ever saved under William
[1:23:33] Brandham's ministry? Cuz I want to know
[1:23:36] what you're saying.
[1:23:37] Can you say that no souls, not a single
[1:23:41] soul was led to Christ or healed under
[1:23:46] brother Brandham's ministry? Now, be
[1:23:48] careful,
[1:23:50] right? Because
[1:23:52] are you not careful to watch your words
[1:23:55] against someone who very might very well
[1:23:59] might have been used by God even though
[1:24:02] you don't know it or don't believe it. I
[1:24:05] I I want that answer.
[1:24:08] Can you say that absolutely no souls
[1:24:11] were saved or brought to Christ under
[1:24:14] William Brand's ministry when he was
[1:24:16] there and afterward?
[1:24:19] Because I want to know what you want us
[1:24:20] to do with all this great evidence and
[1:24:22] information you've provided us and to
[1:24:25] discourage all our young people. What do
[1:24:27] you want us to do?
[1:24:30] Right. What do you want us to do?
[1:24:32] denounce William Brandham and then what
[1:24:36] uh you want us to say that all the work
[1:24:39] that was done by God, all the prayers
[1:24:41] that were made, all the people in the
[1:24:43] lines, whoever came, there was zero
[1:24:46] healings,
[1:24:48] there were zero testimonies. Are you
[1:24:51] telling us that thousands of people who
[1:24:53] accepted the message didn't accept
[1:24:55] Christ as their personal savior? Their
[1:24:57] lives were not changed. Is that what
[1:24:59] you're telling us? So what are you
[1:25:00] telling us? What must we do with all the
[1:25:02] stuff you're putting out to us?
[1:25:06] Let's go to number eight. Leaving the
[1:25:09] message leads to leaving Christ.
[1:25:11] Apparently, that's what their take is
[1:25:14] from what I said last week.
[1:25:17] Okay.
[1:25:19] Is a fear appeal? In other words, I'm
[1:25:22] scaring people into if you leave the
[1:25:25] message, you're going to leave Christ.
[1:25:26] Not an argument. Okay.
[1:25:29] They many people leave high control
[1:25:32] religious systems and remain Christians.
[1:25:34] That's true. Truth does not acquire
[1:25:37] hostage taking. Apparently I was taken
[1:25:39] hostages. If Christianity collapses
[1:25:42] without Brham that indicates that
[1:25:45] indictes Brham, not Christianity.
[1:25:50] Awesome. Okay.
[1:25:53] Oh man, I don't know how these people
[1:25:54] come up with all this stuff. Listen
[1:25:57] people, nobody said Christianity
[1:25:59] collapses without William Brandom. Don't
[1:26:02] put words in our mouth. We didn't say
[1:26:04] that. All message believers know that we
[1:26:08] respect true Christians in other
[1:26:11] denominations. We even believe there is
[1:26:14] a foolish virgin. We believe there are
[1:26:16] virgin Christians in other
[1:26:18] denominations. We believe there are
[1:26:20] precious Christians all over the world,
[1:26:22] not in the message, who live righteous
[1:26:25] lives and who do so much for the gospel
[1:26:27] of Christ. I'll tell you this, I would
[1:26:30] even enjoy listening to sermons of
[1:26:33] Pastor John MacArthur over some of the
[1:26:36] performative message ministers that I
[1:26:38] hear. The man made more sense to me than
[1:26:41] a lot of people who claim to preach in
[1:26:43] the message. The man was a respectful
[1:26:45] man, read his Bible, study. I've got
[1:26:48] plenty of denominational friends who I
[1:26:50] respect and I know. So don't give me
[1:26:55] this dril, right? Those who leave the
[1:26:58] message, the ones I'm talking about, who
[1:27:00] leave the message with hate in their
[1:27:03] hearts, making it an obsession to defame
[1:27:06] the prophet, call him a liar, call him
[1:27:09] trash, call him false prophet. Firstly,
[1:27:11] that's not even Christian behavior. Do
[1:27:13] you agree? Then they make it their every
[1:27:16] waking moment to criticize and bring
[1:27:18] down others, to shame ministers, to uh
[1:27:22] investigate pastors and their churches,
[1:27:25] to bring them before the law, to do all
[1:27:28] of these things, to bring to shame
[1:27:30] message people on public platforms,
[1:27:33] investigate others to bring them down,
[1:27:35] end up uh all these people end up
[1:27:38] professing Christianity and end up
[1:27:40] leaving the most or living the most
[1:27:43] unrighteous just double standard lives
[1:27:45] you can ever think of. That's what I
[1:27:47] said. Okay. And I speak from experience.
[1:27:50] I've seen that here in SA. Many of those
[1:27:53] who left with this nature have gone into
[1:27:56] alcohol, drugs, smoking heavily,
[1:28:00] marriages are messed up, children badly
[1:28:03] backsliden, don't even care to go to
[1:28:05] church, don't even pay attention in the
[1:28:07] denominational church they've settled
[1:28:08] in. Many have stopped going to church
[1:28:10] altogether.
[1:28:12] They live blaming the message. They are
[1:28:15] excited to blame the message. They blame
[1:28:18] the message for their lives going into
[1:28:21] terrible situations and all they can do
[1:28:24] they do all they can to prove the
[1:28:27] message wrong. If they go you know if
[1:28:29] they go attend a denomination and remain
[1:28:32] a good Christian we will even applaud
[1:28:34] them for having faith and taking
[1:28:36] responsibility over their lives. But
[1:28:39] leaving the word and then living a life
[1:28:42] that does not even reflect Christ at all
[1:28:45] is worrying and concerning for parents
[1:28:48] and family. Which is why I said that,
[1:28:51] right? Um I'll tell you one thing. There
[1:28:55] is a brother I know personally who
[1:28:58] recently left the message and yet has
[1:29:00] shown impeccable character. He says, he
[1:29:03] told me he still regards brother Madam
[1:29:06] as a prophet of God, but he doesn't see
[1:29:08] him as Elijah or the seventh messenger
[1:29:10] of the last church age. He is respectful
[1:29:13] and he's not interested in shaming
[1:29:15] anyone. That is a real Christian
[1:29:17] attitude I can get behind. The man has a
[1:29:20] backbone. The man has scruples. The man
[1:29:22] has has uh decency in him, not this
[1:29:25] other stuff that we're seeing. The man
[1:29:28] treads carefully aware of the Holy
[1:29:30] Spirit.
[1:29:33] All right, very big difference.
[1:29:36] Uh, as we coming towards the end, let's
[1:29:38] go to number nine.
[1:29:43] Redefining abuse, control, and church
[1:29:46] harm as misunderstanding
[1:29:50] the message. Oh, this is a rich one.
[1:29:52] This is amazing. Misunderstanding the
[1:29:54] message evades responsibility.
[1:29:57] Now
[1:29:59] I read this here and I also saw this in
[1:30:01] that video of that brother who spoke
[1:30:03] about you can tell by the fruit.
[1:30:07] It says here when patterns repeat across
[1:30:10] churches, countries and decades that is
[1:30:14] not just bad actors. Systems produce
[1:30:17] fruit. Scripture tells us to judge by
[1:30:21] fruit.
[1:30:23] Wonderful. I'm glad you brought that up
[1:30:26] and I'm sorry. This is just plain silly
[1:30:31] and ignorant reasoning if ever I heard.
[1:30:34] Right. And this I hear consistently from
[1:30:37] these people. By their fruit you shall
[1:30:39] know them. That because you have all
[1:30:42] these uh um message ministers who abuse
[1:30:46] their people. This one is immoral. This
[1:30:49] one did that. This one did that.
[1:30:51] Therefore the message is wrong. Okay,
[1:30:54] listen. Wake up. By this argument,
[1:30:58] Christianity has 2,000 years of history
[1:31:01] that has undesirable fruit all over the
[1:31:04] world. And therefore, Christianity will
[1:31:07] be the most false of all religions by
[1:31:10] what you just said. There's more unity
[1:31:13] in Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism than
[1:31:16] there is in Christianity. Right?
[1:31:18] Christianity is probably the most
[1:31:20] divided religion on earth. There are
[1:31:23] literally thousands of different
[1:31:24] denominations who disagree with each
[1:31:26] other, hate each other and speak against
[1:31:29] each other. The Bible has been used, the
[1:31:32] name of Jesus Christ has been invoked to
[1:31:35] murder people, to take people as slaves
[1:31:38] through the slave trade. The Bible was
[1:31:41] used to defend aparate here in my
[1:31:44] country in South Africa. It was used as
[1:31:47] reason for the crusades. Are these the
[1:31:50] fruits of Christ? Is this proper
[1:31:52] reasoning that you're giving me? By that
[1:31:55] standard, please tell me, kind people,
[1:32:00] which church is producing the fruit
[1:32:04] that you're talking about? Which church
[1:32:07] system in the world is immune from
[1:32:10] church scandals, abusive ministers,
[1:32:14] false prophets, false teachers,
[1:32:17] fraudulent
[1:32:20] moves for money. Which church? Name
[1:32:23] them. Name them. Tell me where where
[1:32:27] there are the best Christians in the
[1:32:29] world. Please indulge me.
[1:32:33] You can't. That's why this is such
[1:32:36] pathetic reasoning, right?
[1:32:39] What is the fruit you speak of?
[1:32:42] And here's your arguments, right? We are
[1:32:44] circular reasoning. We do this. We
[1:32:46] produce all here's your arguments. This
[1:32:49] is your argument. Some ministers are bad
[1:32:52] guys, therefore all message ministers
[1:32:56] are bad and are going to hell with their
[1:32:58] churches. Some message ministers are
[1:33:01] bad, therefore the message is false.
[1:33:04] Therefore, William Brandham is a false
[1:33:06] prophet. Do you hear yourself making the
[1:33:09] same post hawk erggo proper hawk? Some
[1:33:12] very bad ministers believe in William
[1:33:14] Brandham's message. Therefore, William
[1:33:16] Brandham bad. Come on. You want to
[1:33:19] debate intellectually? Let's go.
[1:33:24] Sorry, not interested.
[1:33:26] We're interested in those who believe.
[1:33:29] Amen.
[1:33:31] Let's bring this to a close.
[1:33:34] Bottom line, this person says this
[1:33:37] video, so this is the video we put out
[1:33:39] last week, does not answer critics.
[1:33:43] It it relabels criticism as spiritual
[1:33:46] failure. Equates a man with scripture.
[1:33:50] Wow. And teaches loyalty over truth.
[1:33:53] This this proves to me how blind hatred
[1:33:58] it is that though I can explain things
[1:34:03] respectfully and carefully,
[1:34:06] it still tells me, they still tell me
[1:34:08] I'm equating a man with scripture and
[1:34:11] I'm teaching loyalty over truth.
[1:34:14] And this is not how biblical truth
[1:34:16] defends itself. If William Braner must
[1:34:18] be protected from the very standards,
[1:34:21] who's protecting William Brano? We're
[1:34:22] not.
[1:34:24] Go for it, man. Right. If William
[1:34:27] Brandon must be protected from the very
[1:34:29] standard scripture uses to test
[1:34:31] prophets, then he has already failed
[1:34:33] those standards. Listen, they crucified
[1:34:35] Christ. They scourged him. They beat him
[1:34:38] up. They plucked off his beard. They
[1:34:40] punched him in the face. They poked him
[1:34:42] in his side with a spear. Who is William
[1:34:44] Brandon to protect him? Who am I to
[1:34:46] protect me? If they did this to Christ,
[1:34:49] our savior, we're not standing here for
[1:34:52] William Brandham. Listen, when Peter
[1:34:54] tried to defend Christ, Christ healed
[1:34:57] Melkus' ear and told him, "Stop it. This
[1:35:01] must this is meant to be."
[1:35:04] We are in no way protecting William
[1:35:06] Brandham. Do not use what I'm saying for
[1:35:09] one second to think I am doing that.
[1:35:12] This has to be you who are doing this.
[1:35:17] You are ordained of God to do this.
[1:35:19] There you go. Okay.
[1:35:23] He has already failed those stand.
[1:35:25] Listen to this. Listen. Listen. If
[1:35:26] William Brandon must be protected from
[1:35:28] the very standard scripture uses to test
[1:35:30] prophets, then listen to this. I don't
[1:35:32] know who this person is. I don't know
[1:35:34] whether they themselves are a prophet or
[1:35:36] some person with a with a greatly
[1:35:40] anointed with the Holy Ghost. But this
[1:35:42] person is saying of brother Brandham, he
[1:35:44] has already failed those standards.
[1:35:48] My goodness, I wouldn't say that about
[1:35:52] anybody.
[1:35:54] I just wouldn't do that. I wouldn't have
[1:35:56] the gall to do that. I wouldn't have the
[1:35:57] guts to do that to say that about any
[1:36:00] man who has the Holy Spirit. I wouldn't
[1:36:03] even say that about a denominational man
[1:36:07] who has the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:10] healing people in a denominational
[1:36:13] church and on the mission field. I
[1:36:15] wouldn't even say even if he's preaching
[1:36:17] wrong doctrine, I wouldn't say that.
[1:36:21] But here's what you guys are doing. It's
[1:36:23] it's it's phenomenal. It's unbelievable.
[1:36:27] All right, people.
[1:36:30] I just want to say an answer to this. We
[1:36:33] don't need to answer critics. It says
[1:36:34] this video does not answer critics. We
[1:36:36] don't. I didn't do this to answer
[1:36:39] critics. We don't care about critics.
[1:36:42] Okay? We only care to put out wisdom for
[1:36:45] those who read the criticism and ask
[1:36:47] questions. God has ordained all critics
[1:36:51] to be there. There is no need to stop
[1:36:54] them or try to change the minds of the
[1:36:56] critics. equating man to scripture.
[1:36:59] That's just foolishness. I don't even
[1:37:01] know what that means. What does it mean
[1:37:03] equating what you're saying is I'm
[1:37:06] equating William Brandham to scripture.
[1:37:09] I don't even understand that. Maybe I've
[1:37:11] missed out on a lot that has happened um
[1:37:14] online or I quite honestly some of the
[1:37:18] vid the video that I that I saw I have
[1:37:20] seen it for the first I saw it for the
[1:37:21] first time. I didn't even realize there
[1:37:23] were so many parts of things and so many
[1:37:25] people who were why I left a cult why I
[1:37:28] left the cult of William Brandham and
[1:37:29] all this stuff you know there are few
[1:37:32] minutes of fame on on YouTube I don't
[1:37:34] know I have never seen them before but
[1:37:36] having seen now what has been shown me
[1:37:39] just for a few minutes and stuff but you
[1:37:41] know maybe I've missed a lot my view is
[1:37:46] you put yourself out there you are fair
[1:37:48] game and I'm talking about brother Bham
[1:37:51] the prophet would put himself out on
[1:37:52] book and tape and in video and all kinds
[1:37:55] of media. You're fair game. You're fair
[1:37:58] game, brother Brandham. You put yourself
[1:38:00] out there knowing you were going to be
[1:38:02] crit criticized and you were going to
[1:38:05] draw the eye from the world. So, who are
[1:38:08] we kidding, right? We're not going to
[1:38:11] defend you because you put yourself out
[1:38:13] there. We What did we expect? People
[1:38:16] message people. I'm talking to you.
[1:38:20] We did it. We put it out in book. We
[1:38:22] printed his name. We put it in gold and
[1:38:25] silver embossed lettering. We u put his
[1:38:29] stuff out on the internet.
[1:38:31] You said things. You even made up false
[1:38:33] stuff about the prophet. What were you
[1:38:35] expecting the world to sit back and and
[1:38:37] nod along saying, "Oh yeah, what a great
[1:38:40] guy." No.
[1:38:42] What did we expect the world to fall in
[1:38:44] love with? The man who called out
[1:38:46] women's dressing, women's behavior,
[1:38:49] men's men's habits, addictive habits,
[1:38:51] who called out television, rock and
[1:38:53] roll, Hollywood. Did you really think
[1:38:55] the world was just going to say, "Oh,
[1:38:56] yeah, it's okay. Just another preacher.
[1:38:58] Just let him be." Nope. Not at all. He's
[1:39:02] fair game. So, I say, "Go for it. It's
[1:39:05] your choice." Listen, people, we just
[1:39:08] love to hear the word. That's who we
[1:39:10] are.
[1:39:12] We just love to hear the word man. We we
[1:39:13] we just want to worship God through the
[1:39:16] revelation of Jesus Christ revealed in
[1:39:18] this man's voice. That's all. We don't
[1:39:20] want to wear his hat, hold his rifle,
[1:39:23] stand where he stood. We just love the
[1:39:26] word. That's all. That's all we we're
[1:39:29] doing. I've I've traveled to America so
[1:39:31] many times. I didn't go there to wear
[1:39:33] his hat and stand in this place and try
[1:39:36] to feel the anointing over in this
[1:39:38] place. No, there are people who do that.
[1:39:40] I'm just not one of them. Right?
[1:39:44] So, I want to mention this last thing.
[1:39:47] Well, two things. This the first is this
[1:39:50] 1977 conundrum. Those of you who know or
[1:39:54] read about it where brother says,
[1:39:57] I predict, I do not prophesy, but as a
[1:40:00] student of the Bible, I predict that
[1:40:02] 1977 will be the ending of whatever
[1:40:04] whatever the ushering of the millennium
[1:40:07] and so on. Okay, this I I think I
[1:40:10] explained this in in doctrines of the
[1:40:12] message and uh I've I've done it so many
[1:40:15] times. I'm not going to go through it
[1:40:17] all again, right? I've looked at the
[1:40:19] statements he made. I only heard him
[1:40:21] say, "I predict I do not prophesy." And
[1:40:23] yet he himself
[1:40:25] believed being a minister of God
[1:40:28] believed that it would be the ushering
[1:40:29] in of the millennium. I could try and
[1:40:31] explain and defend him and say, "Well,
[1:40:33] the ushering in of the millennium means
[1:40:35] this." and to defend his prediction. But
[1:40:38] there isn't any point, is there? My
[1:40:42] question, and this is what I want to
[1:40:43] show you, to bring balance, to bring
[1:40:46] wisdom.
[1:40:48] Was he here speaking presumptuously, or
[1:40:51] did God inspire him? The same way, the
[1:40:55] same way he inspired Jonah and Peter?
[1:40:59] Cuz you must understand prophets.
[1:41:01] There's going to be naysayers. We can
[1:41:03] deal with that, right? But what do you
[1:41:05] believe? What do you believe when you
[1:41:08] read this? Okay, we can spin it. We can.
[1:41:12] Trust me. If you have messages and Bible
[1:41:15] scriptures, you can spin it. You can do
[1:41:17] what you want and make it sound accurate
[1:41:20] and so on. It's never going to satisfy
[1:41:22] the naysayers. Maybe some of you might
[1:41:24] be satisfied with a good explanation.
[1:41:26] I'm not going to do that. But read this.
[1:41:29] Here's another one. Peter the great
[1:41:32] apostle,
[1:41:34] he says in 1 Peter 4:7, "But the end of
[1:41:38] all things is at hand. Be you therefore
[1:41:42] sober and watch unto prayer." I'm saying
[1:41:46] to you, this is like the prophet having
[1:41:49] a feeling that 1977
[1:41:53] is going to be whatever it is. Maybe
[1:41:56] he's he didn't say the coming of the
[1:41:58] Lord. Maybe the ushering in of the
[1:42:01] millennium can be translated to be the
[1:42:03] rapture or the coming of the Lord. Did
[1:42:04] he use those words, the rapture? No, he
[1:42:06] didn't. So, we can be a little bit
[1:42:09] technical here and there. Stop it.
[1:42:11] Right. Look at Peter. Peter is telling
[1:42:15] the people in his day, the end of all
[1:42:18] things is at hand. Means it's happening
[1:42:21] now. It's going to happen right away. So
[1:42:25] what you need to do is watch and pray.
[1:42:29] Be really sober. It means watch, right?
[1:42:32] So what was Peter false? Did Peter
[1:42:36] prophesy or did he predict here? Did he
[1:42:38] have a feeling? Did he believe that in
[1:42:41] his day was the end of all things? Yes,
[1:42:44] he did.
[1:42:46] And he was wrong.
[1:42:49] Oh, brother Alistister, what are you
[1:42:51] saying? Well, we now know he was wrong
[1:42:54] because the end of all things did not
[1:42:57] happen in Peter's day, right? But the
[1:43:01] the Holy Spirit and God made him say
[1:43:04] this. Obviously, I will never believe
[1:43:07] that anything in scripture is wrong. So,
[1:43:10] I'm saying in the eyes of people, people
[1:43:13] would say, and I know this for a fact
[1:43:15] because this is an exact scripture that
[1:43:17] people say Peter prophesied falsely.
[1:43:21] But we we know because we know because
[1:43:25] of how God handles his prophets and his
[1:43:28] people that what is more important is
[1:43:32] the word and not the credibility of the
[1:43:35] vessels. So what did he do? He got all
[1:43:38] those disciples told them things made
[1:43:41] confusing. I I preached a whole message
[1:43:44] uh as one of the first messages
[1:43:47] uh on the second coming. My first
[1:43:49] message was the confusing uh the
[1:43:51] confusion created by the confusing
[1:43:54] statements of Christ spoken to the
[1:43:56] disciples right where he speaks about uh
[1:44:00] this generation shall not pass and all
[1:44:03] of these scriptures that I showed you.
[1:44:04] I've preached an entire message on it.
[1:44:07] So did Peter prophesy or did he predict
[1:44:10] here? He believed it. Listen people, I I
[1:44:13] don't want to downplay this. I want you
[1:44:15] to understand the seriousness of it.
[1:44:17] Peter said this. And then Christ did not
[1:44:19] come the second time in Peter's day.
[1:44:21] Right? Peter believed it. John believed
[1:44:25] it. James believed it. All of them
[1:44:27] believed it. They believed the coming of
[1:44:29] the Lord was in their day. And some of
[1:44:31] them, the Bible says, believed that John
[1:44:34] was going to be alive to see it. The
[1:44:35] Bible records that based on what Jesus
[1:44:38] said. So this belief of the disciples
[1:44:41] and apostles was definitely inspired by
[1:44:44] the Holy Ghost. Why did the Holy Ghost
[1:44:47] inspire them to say something that was
[1:44:49] not going to happen?
[1:44:52] Like I told you before, they got people
[1:44:54] to sell up all their stuff. They divided
[1:44:57] all their belongings among the saints.
[1:44:59] They forsook their vocations. That means
[1:45:01] they left their jobs. This was so
[1:45:04] serious that when listen Ananas and Safh
[1:45:09] died,
[1:45:11] the Holy Ghost brought their death
[1:45:14] because they refused to sell their
[1:45:16] belongings and bring it and properly
[1:45:18] divide it among the saints. I mean this
[1:45:20] was a big deal. The Lord clearly did not
[1:45:23] come in that time and it was not the end
[1:45:26] of all things. So why did Ananas and
[1:45:28] Zafra have to die?
[1:45:31] Why couldn't they have kept some of this
[1:45:32] stuff if the Lord was not really coming?
[1:45:35] Didn't they have enough time to go and
[1:45:38] spread the gospel? Why do they have to
[1:45:40] do all this? You people say those poor
[1:45:43] message believers who believe the
[1:45:45] rapture was taking place in 1977. They
[1:45:48] sold their stuff, sold their houses and
[1:45:50] their cars. They put their families in
[1:45:52] order. Blah blah blah. Poor ignorant
[1:45:54] fools, they thought. Have you considered
[1:45:58] that God was in it irrespective of what
[1:46:01] it was going to look like to the
[1:46:02] naysayers? Whatever God wanted to
[1:46:05] achieve has been achieved.
[1:46:08] I'm saying I don't know enough because I
[1:46:11] was a baby then. I was only born in 1975
[1:46:14] and I was not even there when the
[1:46:16] prophet spoke these things. So I don't
[1:46:18] know why he would say what he said.
[1:46:20] Right? I'm not going to stand here in
[1:46:22] 2026 and assume that I know why he
[1:46:24] predicted this. right? Uh or or what
[1:46:28] inspired him or why God inspired him to
[1:46:31] say this, but I will do as Galiel said,
[1:46:35] don't speak against it. For adventure,
[1:46:37] it is of God. Just let it be. If it is
[1:46:40] of God, it will prosper. If not, it
[1:46:42] won't.
[1:46:44] So, I'm careful, right?
[1:46:47] Okay. Our last point is on this
[1:46:50] plagiarism
[1:46:52] and this you know this really uh
[1:46:57] shocked me a little bit. So I want to
[1:46:59] begin by just reading the last quote
[1:47:01] before we close
[1:47:03] the message 7 70th week of Daniel. This
[1:47:06] is paragraph 49
[1:47:08] and brother brother is saying here in
[1:47:11] 1961
[1:47:13] and I've read many of their commentaries
[1:47:16] on it. I'm very grateful to Mr. Smith of
[1:47:19] the Adventist Church for his views. I'm
[1:47:22] very grateful to Dr. Lan
[1:47:25] of his views. I'm grateful to all these
[1:47:27] great scholars for their views on this.
[1:47:30] So, brother Marmy is saying, I've read
[1:47:33] Dr. Smith from the Adventist church.
[1:47:36] I've read his books. I've read Lockan's
[1:47:38] books. I've read the books of other
[1:47:40] great scholars. And then he says, "And
[1:47:42] in reading them, it enlightens me much
[1:47:46] that I can find places that looks right.
[1:47:50] But to get the views that I thought that
[1:47:53] I would like to explain, I searched
[1:47:55] through the encyclopedia of time to find
[1:47:58] out what time meant."
[1:48:01] Okay.
[1:48:03] Um, so
[1:48:09] in some ways I want to say I'm shocked
[1:48:12] by these ministers who are leaving the
[1:48:14] message because they are just now they
[1:48:17] are they are being discouraged by
[1:48:19] brother Brandham's plagiarism. I mean
[1:48:22] did you not ask questions when you were
[1:48:25] with your daddies who were there in the
[1:48:28] prophet's meetings or your daddies who
[1:48:31] were preachers? Did you not ask the
[1:48:33] questions? Did you not read Clarence
[1:48:35] Lockan yourself being a minister for so
[1:48:38] many years? How are you shocked that
[1:48:40] brother said things from Clarence
[1:48:42] Lockan's books when you know uh he said
[1:48:47] things from his books and other books
[1:48:50] and we know that
[1:48:53] I did. I asked my dad and I'll even tell
[1:48:56] you why. My question to you ministers
[1:48:59] leaving the message because of
[1:49:01] plagiarism.
[1:49:02] Why were you shocked and disturbed that
[1:49:04] brother Brandon preached from the
[1:49:05] writings of Clarence Lockan and many
[1:49:07] others? You poor thing. So there are
[1:49:11] statements in the message future home
[1:49:14] that he made word for word words of
[1:49:17] Clarence Lan and things that were spoken
[1:49:21] by Clarence Lan were public knowledge.
[1:49:23] They were known by brother Lee Vale and
[1:49:26] other theologians who were listening to
[1:49:27] this message who knew the things that
[1:49:30] were said came from Clarence Lockan. So
[1:49:32] brother Baron this evil genius who read
[1:49:34] these things in secret and spoke these
[1:49:36] things thinking that Lee Hale didn't
[1:49:39] know that it came from Clarence Lan and
[1:49:41] other theologians around him didn't
[1:49:43] know. He just said these things and
[1:49:45] claimed these are my revelations.
[1:49:47] Really? Is that what you think? Right.
[1:49:51] Some of the the the theologians bought
[1:49:53] the books for brother Baron. They gifted
[1:49:55] him with the books and and they directed
[1:49:58] him to the works of these men.
[1:50:01] In fact, voice of God recordings in
[1:50:03] folio views and other places even tells
[1:50:05] us these are the books brother Ben
[1:50:07] Brandham read and studied.
[1:50:09] Right? Okay. Still not enough. Do you
[1:50:13] really think he would say those things
[1:50:15] and claim them as his own among the I
[1:50:17] love the way they constructed. He first
[1:50:19] said this. this is how I get my
[1:50:21] inspiration from God for the message and
[1:50:23] then he says these things off-handedly.
[1:50:26] So
[1:50:28] um do you really think he said those
[1:50:30] things and claimed them as his own among
[1:50:32] theologians who knew where these things
[1:50:34] came from?
[1:50:36] I you know I just want to say that's
[1:50:38] really stupid.
[1:50:40] Brother Benham did that. He was really
[1:50:41] being foolish knowing he was sitting
[1:50:44] amongst these guys who read went to
[1:50:46] Bible school knew all those things and
[1:50:49] said those things. Listen people that
[1:50:51] was public knowledge in brother Bam's
[1:50:53] day. If he said those when he said when
[1:50:56] he spoke about the Abrahamic covenant,
[1:50:57] the Davidic covenant, the Mosaic
[1:50:59] covenant, the Noah covenant. Those are
[1:51:01] all written in in dispensational truth.
[1:51:04] I have this book right here,
[1:51:05] dispensational truth by Clarence Lockan.
[1:51:08] I have this book here, Rightly Dividing
[1:51:10] the Word by Clarence Lockan. I've got
[1:51:12] Luther's works here. I've got Spurgeon's
[1:51:14] works here. I read these books. These
[1:51:17] books are passed down in our family for
[1:51:19] decades. They've been the books that my
[1:51:21] dad read. Um, so I I do it sometimes in
[1:51:25] my teaching. When I preach, I speak
[1:51:28] things that are public knowledge which I
[1:51:30] know are are written in books that
[1:51:32] they're not coming from me. And I don't
[1:51:34] always say these things were said by
[1:51:36] brother Lan or brother so and so from
[1:51:39] from this place. My question is
[1:51:43] to you people to those ministers shocked
[1:51:45] that brother Baron plagiarized. Okay.
[1:51:49] uh apart from those paragraphs where
[1:51:52] they were word for word from Clarence
[1:51:54] Lockan in the entire 72page future whole
[1:51:58] message
[1:52:01] was everything else plagiarism
[1:52:04] is everything else in that book
[1:52:07] nothing is there nothing else there
[1:52:09] inspired by the Holy Ghost apart from so
[1:52:13] because of those statements that he made
[1:52:15] the whole book is just cancelled is that
[1:52:17] what you're
[1:52:19] Right. So, nothing else in there is
[1:52:22] spoken. Uh, is there anything else in
[1:52:24] that book, Future Home, that was not
[1:52:28] said by Clarence Lock?
[1:52:31] Yes. Plenty.
[1:52:33] Right.
[1:52:35] So, is nothing else because he
[1:52:38] plagiarized nothing else is inspired by
[1:52:41] the Holy Ghost. Wow.
[1:52:44] In a few other statements, other
[1:52:45] messages, all they bring it up. the
[1:52:47] seals, the church ages. I've I I've
[1:52:51] heard message people tell me the church
[1:52:54] ages is false because it was written by
[1:52:56] Lee Vale. There's a whole sect of the
[1:52:58] message that believes that cancel the
[1:53:00] church age book because it's written by
[1:53:02] Lee Vale. Uh you know, okay, Daniel 70
[1:53:06] weeks I I know Daniel 70 weeks because I
[1:53:08] studied it with my dad and with that
[1:53:11] book dispensational truths. I know what
[1:53:14] brother gets from it. I knew that years
[1:53:16] ago when I was 16 like why are these
[1:53:20] ministers with 30 40 years in the
[1:53:21] message now suddenly shocked because
[1:53:24] there's which means they never read it
[1:53:27] they never studied it right so um
[1:53:31] some maybe word for word from other
[1:53:33] Christian preachers of previous
[1:53:35] centuries uh even if brother Brandham
[1:53:38] said those things was it not the truth
[1:53:40] that was said so I'm asking are you 100%
[1:53:43] sure that God did not inspire him to say
[1:53:47] what they said and then improve on it.
[1:53:50] If he said the angel showed it to him,
[1:53:53] could he not have been referring to what
[1:53:55] the angel revealed to him after he he
[1:53:59] said what those other men said and what
[1:54:02] the angel showed him to improve on what
[1:54:05] those men said. Those of you who read
[1:54:07] the message can search, go into your
[1:54:10] table or follow your views and search
[1:54:12] for the name Lan. You'll find brother
[1:54:14] mamm speaks of him speaks of Smith
[1:54:16] speaks of Calvin Nox Finny Sanki and
[1:54:18] others and you'll find that brother
[1:54:20] madam openly says he read their works
[1:54:24] and he agrees with them on some and he
[1:54:26] disagrees with them he differences or
[1:54:28] difference with them on that. Right? He
[1:54:31] also speaks about Scoffield. He tells us
[1:54:34] that he studied with a Scoffield Bible.
[1:54:36] He had a Scoffield Bible and he agrees
[1:54:38] with Scoffield here and he doesn't agree
[1:54:40] with Scoffield there. He pre he even
[1:54:42] preaches something stating this is not
[1:54:45] news to us. This is why we don't
[1:54:47] understand why people are suddenly
[1:54:48] shocked and calling it plagiarism.
[1:54:51] Again, those of you who actually study
[1:54:54] the message
[1:54:56] would also know that he believed in his
[1:54:59] ministry, brother Baron's belief in his
[1:55:01] ministry was that he was to do one
[1:55:05] particular thing. Go type this into your
[1:55:08] table. such loose ends.
[1:55:12] He believed his ministry was to tie up
[1:55:15] the loose ends left by all these men.
[1:55:19] That's what he believed. That's what he
[1:55:21] believed God showed to him, right? That
[1:55:24] meant he agreed with a lot of things
[1:55:27] they said, a lot of things. Their dates,
[1:55:30] their times, their diagrams, some of
[1:55:33] their teachings, some of their wordings.
[1:55:35] He agreed with it, but not everything.
[1:55:39] I was never shocked because I studied
[1:55:41] these books myself when I was 16. My dad
[1:55:43] had me go through it. He made me take uh
[1:55:47] uh uh diagrams from dispensational truth
[1:55:50] and had me draw them out in A1 pages
[1:55:54] when he would do teachings for the
[1:55:55] church. So I replicated
[1:55:58] Clarence Lockan's drawings because
[1:56:01] brother Bammy used those drawings. I I
[1:56:04] remember even doing the body, spirit,
[1:56:06] soul diagram from Clarence Lockan,
[1:56:09] except we swapped out spirit and soul.
[1:56:13] To me, it's like how could you message
[1:56:15] ministers whose fathers were in the
[1:56:18] ministry with the prophet and our
[1:56:20] friends? How could you not know this?
[1:56:22] What did you not study the message?
[1:56:25] I was never shocked because I've studied
[1:56:27] these books myself. I still have all
[1:56:29] these books with me. I was not surprised
[1:56:31] that brother Benham used it because I'd
[1:56:34] studied Lan from a 16-year-old. I had
[1:56:36] seen where brother Benham had spoken
[1:56:38] from. I I can tell you where brother
[1:56:40] Benham spoke from Lockan's writings
[1:56:42] concerning Daniel's visions, the
[1:56:44] three-fold purpose of Christ, the
[1:56:46] covenants, the body, spirit soul, and
[1:56:48] many other things. These were teachings
[1:56:49] that rose up during the reformation by
[1:56:52] amazing men under that man beast
[1:56:55] anointing. And having studied them
[1:56:57] myself from my youth, I could also
[1:56:59] compare with the message. I could see
[1:57:01] because I read Lan, I read the others
[1:57:04] and I read the message and I see exactly
[1:57:06] what it was no issue for me because I
[1:57:09] know brother Maram is tying up the loose
[1:57:11] ends,
[1:57:13] you know. So
[1:57:15] you may see it as plagiarism.
[1:57:18] I see it as God's word and not the word
[1:57:20] of men. To me, it's not the word of
[1:57:23] Clarence Lan. It's not the word of
[1:57:25] Luther. It's not the word of Wesley.
[1:57:27] It's the word of God through those men.
[1:57:29] And if God wants to speak the same word
[1:57:31] through another man, it's not
[1:57:32] plagiarism. It's the word of God. I
[1:57:36] certainly did not see brother Brandon
[1:57:37] literally taking a doctrine, you know,
[1:57:40] and saying the serpent seed revelation
[1:57:43] is my revelation. He even said in
[1:57:45] marriage and divorce, serpent seed
[1:57:47] became new after the seals were open.
[1:57:51] If you didn't read it and you're
[1:57:53] shocked,
[1:57:54] that's because you didn't do due
[1:57:56] diligence. We knew that the serpent seed
[1:57:58] doctrine was something brought in by the
[1:58:00] Jews and that was kicked out as a
[1:58:02] heretical doctrine by Irenius.
[1:58:05] We knew because we studied church
[1:58:07] history. We were not shocked. I've never
[1:58:11] in my life believed that serpent seed
[1:58:13] was something brother Brandon came up
[1:58:14] with
[1:58:17] because it was known by denominations,
[1:58:19] right? and it was rejected by them. We
[1:58:22] knew this. I I'm shocked that you
[1:58:24] message people don't know this. And now
[1:58:27] you're shocked about plagiarism. It's
[1:58:29] It's incredible. I don't understand. But
[1:58:32] you know what? I think I know why.
[1:58:34] Because you spent your lives in this
[1:58:36] message,
[1:58:38] not studying the word, not properly
[1:58:40] doing due diligence to your studies as
[1:58:42] ministers. All you do is preach
[1:58:45] anointing for uh you know what?
[1:58:49] overcoming or uh God rich in mercy and
[1:58:54] just Pentecostal
[1:58:56] um like messages, just good feeling
[1:58:58] messages. You're the bride, you're safe,
[1:59:01] you're the that's all you do while I
[1:59:03] watch my dad go to his study from 8:00
[1:59:06] in the morning to 2 every day like a
[1:59:09] working day studying. And I do the same
[1:59:11] Monday to Friday like a full workday
[1:59:14] pouring through the word searching the
[1:59:16] scriptures reading checking this with
[1:59:18] that. During co my dad was preaching
[1:59:21] seven days a week during lockdown while
[1:59:24] others were just sitting around.
[1:59:27] Do the work. Stop acting surprised.
[1:59:32] You know you who are anti- William
[1:59:35] Brandham will only see plagiarism in the
[1:59:38] message future home. I want to ask you a
[1:59:40] question. Do you see the abundant
[1:59:43] mysteries hidden in the message future
[1:59:45] home? I bet you don't. Do you see the
[1:59:49] things there that he spoke that were not
[1:59:51] spoken by Lan but revealed in its time
[1:59:54] by the Holy Spirit to him? You probably
[1:59:57] don't. And I want to tell you that's
[2:00:00] what we feast on. What you can't see.
[2:00:04] I want to say something. I know it's not
[2:00:06] very nice, but um like I said in the
[2:00:09] beginning,
[2:00:11] uh these guys call us cult leaders, cult
[2:00:14] pastors. They use the worst words on us.
[2:00:17] Branommites. They call us brandomites.
[2:00:20] They they they shame us publicly. They
[2:00:23] investigate our churches. They
[2:00:26] to me
[2:00:30] they are turn coats eating humble pie.
[2:00:35] So I want to say this. It is true there
[2:00:39] is a lot of brandism and cultish
[2:00:42] behavior among message churches. Some
[2:00:44] very severe in cultural areas and others
[2:00:48] they're just playing it safe.
[2:00:51] I just want to say to the to the people
[2:00:53] to you young people I'm closing now. I
[2:00:56] want to say to you young people who are
[2:00:58] reading all this stuff
[2:01:00] by these people, these websites, people
[2:01:04] going online making their their message
[2:01:07] videos and how they left and all this
[2:01:09] stuff and these ministers especially. I
[2:01:12] want to say
[2:01:14] those of you listening to the stuff
[2:01:16] against the prophet and being
[2:01:19] discouraged,
[2:01:21] these elders and older people who are
[2:01:23] leaving the message now after being in
[2:01:26] it for many years are the ones who
[2:01:28] caused all this ruckus and who are
[2:01:31] responsible for all the branimism that
[2:01:34] exists.
[2:01:36] Some of these who were in the prophet's
[2:01:39] meetings and some who were the children
[2:01:42] of these men who were in the prophet's
[2:01:43] meetings or friends of the prophet or
[2:01:46] friends of the prophet's friends. These
[2:01:50] people forced us to listen to their
[2:01:52] stories of William Brham. They told
[2:01:55] yarns and stories of supernatural
[2:01:57] events. They gave testimonies. They
[2:02:00] cried tears telling us of all their
[2:02:02] experiences and dreams they had and
[2:02:05] supernatural things took place in their
[2:02:07] lives and vindications God gave them.
[2:02:11] And they prophesied over some people and
[2:02:13] had dreams and visions about about
[2:02:16] things. They went around the world
[2:02:18] passing out pictures of a cloud,
[2:02:19] pictures of the prophet with the pillar
[2:02:21] of fire, passing out paraphernalia
[2:02:24] uh from the prophet's life, promoting
[2:02:27] idolatry and loyalty to the man. They
[2:02:32] did it. Their stories got them respect.
[2:02:36] They were invited to the best churches.
[2:02:40] They were uh invited um given funding to
[2:02:44] travel to the world. They saw the world
[2:02:48] to tell their stories. They got respect.
[2:02:51] People flocked to see them. People would
[2:02:54] fill like a like an arena, like a
[2:02:56] stadium to come and hear these stories.
[2:02:59] They did it.
[2:03:01] They were elders. They were song
[2:03:03] leaders. They were they corrected us.
[2:03:06] They forced us to comply with their
[2:03:08] legalism. They checked out our dressing,
[2:03:11] our hairstyles, our fashion, our music,
[2:03:14] our entertainment, our books. They
[2:03:17] controlled our lives. When they were
[2:03:19] song leaders, they composed songs with
[2:03:21] brother Bam's name in it. And elders and
[2:03:24] preachers held us accountable as
[2:03:26] teenagers to cood to the highest
[2:03:29] standard with the most severe penalties.
[2:03:32] When we became preachers, they put the
[2:03:34] highest pressure on on us to say what
[2:03:37] the prophet says, to stay with the
[2:03:39] tapes, or else they wouldn't give us the
[2:03:40] pulpit. They did this. They caused this.
[2:03:46] And now after benefiting financially
[2:03:49] from his name, taking tithes and
[2:03:52] offerings, educating their children with
[2:03:54] that money, putting them through
[2:03:56] colleges and universities, setting
[2:03:58] themselves up financially, making
[2:04:00] businesses for themselves, they think
[2:04:02] now is finally time for them to tell us
[2:04:06] the truth. They go on YouTube and
[2:04:09] internet and sanctimoniously lecture us
[2:04:12] on what truth is and how William
[2:04:14] Brandham is a false prophet.
[2:04:18] After the mess they created, they tuck
[2:04:21] their tails between their legs and
[2:04:23] become the greater theologians than
[2:04:25] anybody else, historians, factcheckers,
[2:04:29] and do not apologize for what they have
[2:04:31] done or for capitalizing on the message
[2:04:34] of a humble man. They're richer than
[2:04:37] William Brham ever was. There's a very
[2:04:40] poignant phrase that was used during the
[2:04:43] Middle Ages and the American Civil War
[2:04:45] that said, "Never trust a turncoat." The
[2:04:49] feeling behind it was if they betrayed
[2:04:51] their side once, they'll betray the next
[2:04:54] side they choose.
[2:04:56] I've seen this in my time in the
[2:04:58] message. And the very people who were
[2:05:01] legalistic and victimize other people
[2:05:04] and other people's children, when it
[2:05:06] came time and their children grew up and
[2:05:09] they couldn't handle them and they
[2:05:10] couldn't keep their wives in line, then
[2:05:13] they chose to leave the message and
[2:05:15] demonize the prophet and message people.
[2:05:17] How convenient.
[2:05:19] I'm not saying that every person who
[2:05:21] leaves the message has done these
[2:05:22] things, but certainly the leaders and
[2:05:25] preachers and elders and song leaders
[2:05:28] and deacons who held all this, you have
[2:05:33] a lot to account for. What I'm saying to
[2:05:36] you is
[2:05:38] people who pushed and propagated
[2:05:40] brandomism instead of the word cannot be
[2:05:44] trusted with their now sanctimonious
[2:05:46] lectures and newfound discoveries and
[2:05:49] revelations. The only thing it proves is
[2:05:52] this.
[2:05:53] If you were in the message and promoted
[2:05:56] and propagated brandomism instead of the
[2:05:59] word and now you are claiming that he's
[2:06:01] a liar and a false prophet, then you are
[2:06:04] just proving that you are someone who
[2:06:07] was deceived when you claimed to be
[2:06:09] saved and have the Holy Ghost for
[2:06:12] decades.
[2:06:13] But you were living under the deception
[2:06:16] of the highest note according to you.
[2:06:18] And now the s now it hurts you that you
[2:06:21] have to say this but you were deceived.
[2:06:24] You were deceived.
[2:06:27] That's what you are actually saying. And
[2:06:29] the same Holy Ghost now is revealing to
[2:06:32] you that he's false. You really want us
[2:06:34] to believe? What? You think I'm stupid?
[2:06:36] You think we are stupid? That all those
[2:06:39] years you claimed to have the Holy
[2:06:40] Ghost. You did all these great things in
[2:06:42] William Brandham's name. You propagated
[2:06:44] brandomism. And now you have the Holy
[2:06:46] Ghost to tell us he's false. Really,
[2:06:51] I'm sorry. This is really annoying. If
[2:06:53] you are somebody who has who was hurt by
[2:06:56] message ministers, by a message church,
[2:06:59] you were subjected to legalism by those
[2:07:02] people who propagated brandomism. You
[2:07:05] have a legitimate reason to leave. It's
[2:07:07] understandable. I empathize with you.
[2:07:10] And God be with you. God prosper your
[2:07:12] way. You have my prayer. If this is the
[2:07:15] reason you're you're leaving the message
[2:07:16] because you abused by an abusive
[2:07:18] ministry, an abusive church, I'm with
[2:07:21] you. May God be with you. I pray for
[2:07:24] you. But let me tell you what the
[2:07:26] message is to us.
[2:07:29] When you remove all the noise, what has
[2:07:32] the ministry of William Brandham? Young
[2:07:34] people, I want you to listen up. What
[2:07:36] has the message of William Brandham done
[2:07:38] for us? And why am I still following it?
[2:07:41] Why are we still following it? as the
[2:07:44] wisdom of God for this day. Here we go.
[2:07:48] It set us free from organized religion.
[2:07:51] It alerted us to the true mark of the
[2:07:53] beast, which is organized religion. It
[2:07:56] identified the abuse of gifts in
[2:07:58] Pentecost. It taught us that what Adam
[2:08:01] lost was oneness with God and the two
[2:08:04] comeings of Christ are purpose to
[2:08:06] restore us back to becoming God made
[2:08:09] flesh. No denomination preaches that. It
[2:08:13] is the message is bride focused. It
[2:08:16] makes us focus on our souls being
[2:08:18] married to the word and not an
[2:08:20] organization or human leadership. It
[2:08:22] shows us there is more to the Bible than
[2:08:25] histories and stories. Uh that the
[2:08:27] mystery of Christ in us lays in the
[2:08:31] types and shadows. The message reveals
[2:08:33] to us that we are to become the bride to
[2:08:36] give mercy to the world and at the white
[2:08:38] th especially at the white throne
[2:08:40] judgment not to condemn people. The
[2:08:43] message reveals to us all of these
[2:08:46] things and the natural benefits of the
[2:08:49] message of living right, dressing right,
[2:08:52] doing what cood teaches us. The natural
[2:08:55] benefits of the message is healthy
[2:08:58] addictionfree bodies, clear minds that
[2:09:02] can focus on a two-hour teaching of the
[2:09:04] word, wholesome marriages, obedient,
[2:09:08] god-fearing, moral living children,
[2:09:11] decently dressed women who express the
[2:09:13] feminine nature of God, who become our
[2:09:16] wives. men who are true headships who
[2:09:19] can lead their homes with the highest
[2:09:21] wisdom, understanding and character of
[2:09:24] Christ. We are non-political. We are not
[2:09:27] bound by religious traditions. We do not
[2:09:29] answer to any head office. Nobody
[2:09:31] controls how we preach. We are all
[2:09:34] sovereign assemblies, each having the
[2:09:36] liberty to receive inspiration from the
[2:09:38] Bible and the message and preach it as
[2:09:41] we see it. Nobody checks on us. The
[2:09:44] people have a right to believe or leave.
[2:09:48] That's it. Nobody signs in. Nobody signs
[2:09:51] out. These benefits serve us well to be
[2:09:55] able to travel, spread the word of
[2:09:57] Christ, knowing that our families and
[2:09:59] our homes are happy and in order back
[2:10:02] home with Christ so that we can speedily
[2:10:04] fulfill our purpose and return and
[2:10:07] everything's still normal and still good
[2:10:09] and still under the banner of and and
[2:10:11] the love of Christ. We are now facing
[2:10:14] challenges that other generations did
[2:10:17] not have and denominational churches
[2:10:20] have no control over these challenges.
[2:10:22] We are reaching that stage right now
[2:10:25] there in this world. Pornography,
[2:10:28] immorality,
[2:10:30] uh uh wokeness,
[2:10:33] gender confusion, whole lot of things
[2:10:36] that's happening right now.
[2:10:37] Denominations have no control over these
[2:10:41] things. Things are going bad to worse.
[2:10:44] We have now reached that stage right now
[2:10:48] in the world in this present time where
[2:10:51] everything is failing. Churches will
[2:10:53] fail, ministries will fail, people will
[2:10:55] fail. And we've reached the stage where
[2:10:58] if the word cannot help you, nothing
[2:11:02] can. That's it. The word is our
[2:11:05] absolute. The word is consistent. The
[2:11:09] word is what will take us through.
[2:11:10] That's where we have reached right now,
[2:11:13] saints.
[2:11:14] I trust that this will
[2:11:17] not answer questions, not answer your
[2:11:20] doubts or anything. All that we want to
[2:11:23] do is put the wisdom out there to
[2:11:26] balance what you are hearing. That's
[2:11:28] what the word is to us. Amen. We do not
[2:11:32] worship William Brandom. We are not a
[2:11:34] cult.
[2:11:36] I don't even understand where this whole
[2:11:38] thing comes from. We are just a normal
[2:11:40] group of church people who do everything
[2:11:43] we can to live right to to worship Jesus
[2:11:47] Christ. We pray to Jesus Christ. We
[2:11:51] worship God. We sing hymns. We sing
[2:11:54] hymns of Ira Deni and Fanny Crosby and
[2:11:57] all these people. We we sing the hymns.
[2:12:00] Uh we don't worship William Brandom. We
[2:12:04] um uh pray to God. We pray to Christ. We
[2:12:09] speak in his name. We believe in the
[2:12:10] blood of Calvary. I don't understand all
[2:12:13] these accusations that they make against
[2:12:15] us and call us all these kind of names,
[2:12:17] but it has to be. So, what we're saying
[2:12:20] is we're not going to convince people or
[2:12:23] answer the critics or, you know,
[2:12:26] whatever it is that people are expecting
[2:12:27] us to do. We are simply going to put the
[2:12:30] word out there. You young people, you
[2:12:32] are in the worst time ever in the
[2:12:35] history of mankind. You are going to
[2:12:37] have all this stuff on this hand. You
[2:12:39] are going to have what we put out in
[2:12:40] this hand and what the prophet has put
[2:12:43] out in the message. You are going to
[2:12:44] have to make a choice. That's where we
[2:12:46] are today. If the word can't help you,
[2:12:49] nothing can. The Lord bless you.
