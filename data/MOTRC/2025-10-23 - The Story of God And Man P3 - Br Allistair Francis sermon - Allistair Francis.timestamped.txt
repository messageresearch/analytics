[0:06] Ephesians 1
[0:09] and verse 7-11.
[0:16] Ephesians 1 7-11. I I really love the
[0:19] book of Ephesians.
[0:21] Really really wonderful book. says, "In
[0:25] whom we have redemption through his
[0:27] blood, the forgiveness of sins,
[0:30] according to the riches of his grace,
[0:34] wherein he hath abounded toward us in
[0:36] all wisdom and prudence,
[0:39] having made known unto us the mystery of
[0:42] his will, according to his good
[0:45] pleasure, which he hath purposed in
[0:47] himself,
[0:50] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[0:53] of times, he might gather together in
[0:56] one all things in Christ, both which are
[0:59] in heaven and which are on earth, even
[1:02] in him. In whom also we have obtained an
[1:07] inheritance,
[1:09] being predestinated according to the
[1:11] purpose of him who workketh all things
[1:14] after the counsel of his will. Amen.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; We have obtained an inheritance. You may
[1:20] be seated.
[1:22] Glory to God. We like to greet you in
[1:24] the precious name of our Lord and Savior
[1:26] Jesus Christ. Certainly good to be with
[1:29] the saints this morning and sharing the
[1:31] word of God. You happy to be here this
[1:33] morning?
[1:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So uh this is going to
[1:38] be the the story of God and man part
[1:41] three and um becoming sons part two.
[1:47] Amen. Becoming sons of God part two. And
[1:49] so for a title uh we're going to speak
[1:52] on the road to adoption.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. The road to adoption.
[1:58] Now uh adoption
[2:03] um is a is a a subject that people have
[2:07] been speaking about for a very long time
[2:10] and uh I would say from all my years in
[2:13] the message
[2:15] um people still don't understand. People
[2:19] have strange ideas about it.
[2:22] Some people feel that it's the
[2:26] manifestation of great things like
[2:30] miracles.
[2:32] Some people feel like it's got to be the
[2:34] restoration of the gifts from the book
[2:37] of Acts like Acts chapter 2 where they
[2:40] they came out with great signs and
[2:43] wonders and spoke in tongues and
[2:45] prophesied and then went off doing great
[2:48] uh miracles of healing and uh
[2:52] discernment and raising people from the
[2:54] dead and um and um so I I understand
[2:59] those statements. I understand those
[3:00] things. I just, you know, want to tell
[3:04] the truth.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; I don't see the point raising you from
[3:08] the dead.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; Because if you were connected with your
[3:14] theophony, why would you want to come
[3:15] back here?
[3:17] &gt;&gt; And in fact, anybody who had reached the
[3:19] seven dimension and you had to raise the
[3:20] guy from the dead is going to say to
[3:22] you, why?
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Why did you bring me back?
[3:25] &gt;&gt; So, I don't understand the need for
[3:28] going back to those things. Those things
[3:31] were necessary
[3:33] to show the gospel to people who had not
[3:37] heard the word
[3:38] &gt;&gt; because of course raising someone from
[3:40] the dead would shock pagans and heathens
[3:43] to say this must be God.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Now it's 2,000 years have passed.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; Right? So people um identify adoption as
[3:55] this thing that's going to produce
[3:58] miracles and wonders that's going to wow
[4:02] the world.
[4:04] And it's so uh amazing to me that people
[4:09] in the message still believe that
[4:12] knowing that Revelations 13 tells you
[4:15] that that second beast that rises out of
[4:17] the land is going to do miracles
[4:21] &gt;&gt; in the sight of men and God that's going
[4:23] to fool the world and lead the world
[4:25] into the mark of the beast.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; So what then is adoption? Now our title
[4:32] is the road to adoption.
[4:35] Adoption is a very commonly used term in
[4:38] the message and very important
[4:41] uh part of becoming sons. Now adoption
[4:44] is no doubt one of the most mysterious
[4:46] attributes of the relationship between
[4:49] God and man. That's why it falls in
[4:51] under our story, the story of God and
[4:53] man. Right? Adoption is the worldly
[4:57] understanding that applies that implies
[5:00] that a child who has no father is given
[5:05] favor to have a father and become a son.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; That's the meaning.
[5:13] &gt;&gt; A child who
[5:15] probably was born and uh let's give you
[5:19] an example like his parents died and so
[5:21] he's got no parents. he's living in an
[5:24] orphanage or something who's been taken
[5:26] by somebody else, but then somebody
[5:29] comes along to say, "I want to adopt
[5:32] you."
[5:33] So, in our terms today, it's like
[5:36] somebody just taking a an orphan and
[5:40] giving them a home.
[5:42] But adoption from way back
[5:46] was about inheritance.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[5:50] So a man who would adopt a child would
[5:53] be a man who had no child himself.
[5:57] But this man has an inheritance and he
[5:59] would like to give it to somebody when
[6:01] he dies.
[6:03] &gt;&gt; So he's going to adopt someone who he
[6:05] feels has the character or he'd like to
[6:09] take on this child to to put in to him a
[6:12] character
[6:14] &gt;&gt; that he could pass that inheritance on
[6:16] to.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the process of adoption,
[6:20] the road to adoption is to build up this
[6:24] strange child
[6:26] into a character that is going to
[6:29] respect me as father.
[6:32] Also is going to love the inheritance
[6:34] I'm going to give to him
[6:36] &gt;&gt; and respect it enough to take care of my
[6:41] name as if it is his own.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:45] Adoption is nowhere near what people
[6:47] have today.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament and from the
[6:51] beginning, adoption would not be
[6:53] necessary if there was no inheritance.
[6:59] &gt;&gt; Today, it's more like, you know, people
[7:01] struggle to have a child, so let's adopt
[7:03] a child. And and often times in in
[7:07] today's world, you you take a child and
[7:09] you've got no inheritance to pass on to
[7:11] them.
[7:13] You know, it's it's we don't really have
[7:15] much inheritance today
[7:17] &gt;&gt; except what's in our bank account and a
[7:19] few policies, you know, and maybe some
[7:22] land and a house and that's not even
[7:24] important. The the kids will grow up and
[7:26] they'll just sell this house,
[7:30] you know, let's just split the money and
[7:33] there's a whole bunch of fights after
[7:34] mom and dad die. You know, there's no
[7:37] love for the house or the love for the
[7:39] inheritance or treasuring the land or
[7:43] great heritage and let's keep this going
[7:45] for the next 200 years. There's no love
[7:48] for it.
[7:50] &gt;&gt; This doesn't even occur to us today.
[7:53] Adoption
[7:55] in the Bible has always been about
[7:58] inheritance.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; We have obtained an inheritance.
[8:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you. So when when trying to
[8:06] understand adoption, this is why I'm
[8:07] saying when people think adoption is the
[8:10] gifts and the and the signs and the
[8:12] wonders. What is that your inheritance?
[8:17] What does that even mean? Right? Oh, we
[8:20] we inherited the power of almighty God.
[8:25] No, still far from it.
[8:28] So in trying to understand adoption of
[8:30] sons through the word of the Lord Jesus
[8:33] Christ, it is a revelation,
[8:37] the understanding of adoption is a
[8:39] revelation that defies all logic and
[8:43] reasonability.
[8:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, if I had to look at you
[8:49] bunch, I would never take you.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; See, I told you. Just tell the truth.
[8:57] [laughter]
[8:58] If I had to look at myself, I would
[9:00] never understand why God would choose
[9:02] me.
[9:04] [snorts]
[9:04] &gt;&gt; I I would find every possible reason for
[9:07] him not to have chosen me.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; And if I had to look at the world or
[9:12] look at in fact in the Bible,
[9:14] Revelations 5, when we look at the
[9:16] question, who is worthy? And the fact
[9:18] that no man is found worthy is enough.
[9:23] So it defies all logic and reasonable
[9:26] thinking.
[9:30] &gt;&gt; It's a mystery that tells us that we we
[9:33] were born into a world having nothing.
[9:37] We were born into a world being orphans.
[9:41] We have no spiritual father.
[9:48] Without the word of God, whose
[9:50] philosophy do you follow?
[9:54] Where does your spiritual inheritance
[9:56] come from?
[9:58] Whose thinking do you adopt? Whose
[10:01] character do you look to? Not even your
[10:04] parents. You start defying your parents
[10:06] from the time you turn 16.
[10:09] You you rebel against your teachers. You
[10:12] hate the system of government. You rebel
[10:15] against politicians. Who do you choose?
[10:18] Do you have a a an Aristotle or a
[10:22] Socrates or a whoever? A Mahatma Gandhi
[10:26] or a Nelson Mandela
[10:29] figure that you will say I want to
[10:32] choose that man's legacy to keep who
[10:39] you don't have anybody. You're an
[10:41] orphan.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not worthy of anything to
[10:48] teach anyone morality
[10:51] the right way.
[10:54] You're not worthy to run a government.
[10:58] There isn't a single government that is
[11:00] worthy today to lead mankind.
[11:04] Nobody tells the truth. Nobody has true
[11:07] morals.
[11:09] Nobody can teach kindness,
[11:11] gentleness, longsuffering. Everyone is a
[11:15] hypocrite.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; In other words, we're orphans.
[11:23] Morally, we are orphans. We have We're
[11:26] born into this world. We come into this
[11:28] world speaking lies.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; We come into this world worthy of only
[11:33] one place and that is hell.
[11:37] &gt;&gt; Right? So yet something inside of us in
[11:42] this entire world of orphans
[11:45] leads us to believe something that
[11:47] brings us to an understanding that we
[11:50] must be born again
[11:52] &gt;&gt; of the spirit. [snorts]
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Totally illogical
[11:57] mystery.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; Everyone looks at us and says we're
[12:00] crazy.
[12:02] When we receive that new birth, we begin
[12:06] to see new things. And it leads us to
[12:08] believe that we are not of this world.
[12:11] That's a second craziness. Cuz everyone
[12:14] around us, our relatives, your cultures,
[12:16] your races, wherever you come from, the
[12:19] people you meet, the educated people
[12:20] today now who are becoming, you know,
[12:23] these great moral hierarchies around us
[12:27] who can teach us what is right and what
[12:29] is true and what is moral.
[12:32] They all tell us we're crazy. Born
[12:34] again,
[12:36] &gt;&gt; Christianity,
[12:38] the Bible,
[12:40] the world will tell us if we say we come
[12:42] from another place,
[12:45] they they're ready to put you in an
[12:47] institution.
[12:49] It's such a mysterious phenomenon that
[12:52] takes adoption. When it when when the
[12:56] new birth grabs a hold of you, it grabs
[12:59] a hold of your conscious and
[13:01] subconscious mind.
[13:03] It's that kind of mystery. And this
[13:05] experience makes us
[13:08] do things unreasonable
[13:11] like it refuses, it makes us refuse ties
[13:15] to the present world.
[13:18] It makes you deny things that can make
[13:20] you feel good temporarily.
[13:24] It makes you feel like
[13:27] uh like I'm doing something wrong if I
[13:29] indulge in a certain pleasure. Nobody
[13:32] else feels that way.
[13:35] And then when we realize that we realize
[13:38] it's a real struggle. It's a struggle to
[13:41] accept this new birth and this process
[13:43] of adoption when we came from when where
[13:47] we came from and because of who we are
[13:50] and who we are now. But we know we have
[13:53] to be uh we have we know what we have to
[13:55] do in order to take ownership of what
[13:58] rightly belongs to us. We know that
[14:01] there's something in God, something in
[14:02] his word. We've come to this
[14:04] understanding through the new birth that
[14:06] there's something we have to do to take
[14:08] ownership of something
[14:11] and it's it's massive. The magnitude of
[14:14] it
[14:15] uh really bewilders us.
[14:20] So in this process of adoption, we have
[14:24] to recognize two things. All right? And
[14:28] it's so
[14:30] easy to understand.
[14:32] If you are an orphan,
[14:35] &gt;&gt; how do you know you're adopted?
[14:40] The first thing is you have to recognize
[14:42] your father.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:45] If you haven't recognized your father,
[14:48] and that's a big deal right there, then
[14:51] you don't even know you're you're
[14:53] adopted or that there's a process of
[14:55] adoption going on. So, the first thing
[14:57] is you have to recognize we have a
[15:01] father that we need to accept
[15:06] is it's not he it's not just him telling
[15:09] you, I'm adopting you. You have to
[15:12] accept his fatherhood.
[15:17] &gt;&gt; And then after getting to know that this
[15:20] is his desire for you and you are
[15:22] accepting his desire for you, you then
[15:25] have to look at his inheritance
[15:28] because that is the reason he is
[15:30] adopting you. It's got to do with his
[15:32] inheritance. It's got to do with what he
[15:35] wants to give to you.
[15:38] &gt;&gt; And you have to be you have to have an
[15:40] affinity to it.
[15:42] &gt;&gt; You have to love it. You have to cherish
[15:44] his adoption because the the experience
[15:49] of cherishing his inheritance is going
[15:52] to make you have an incentive, an
[15:56] objective to continue in this journey.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah. to refuse everything else and any
[16:04] other kind of inheritance this world has
[16:06] to offer because that is in the
[16:09] forefront of your vision.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; That's what you're that's your
[16:13] objective.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; Am I making it clear?
[16:16] &gt;&gt; We have a father. We have an inheritance
[16:19] that we have to desire.
[16:22] Young people, you you cannot give your
[16:27] life to the message because you think
[16:30] it's a good idea.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; You you you can't do this to please your
[16:36] parents or to be a part of the church.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; You have to at at some point in your
[16:41] life come to a decision that there is an
[16:45] objective.
[16:47] &gt;&gt; You have to make a mature decision. This
[16:51] is not a childish decision. This is not
[16:55] a group think decision. This isn't a
[16:57] decision to be made by feelings or
[17:01] emotions. You have to have a time in
[17:04] your life where you sit down really
[17:06] soberly
[17:08] and realize the responsibility that is
[17:10] upon me to complete this journey
[17:14] to finish this road. Amen. Ephesians
[17:18] 1:11 says we have past tense obtained an
[17:22] inheritance. That means the inheritance
[17:24] has been revealed to us and we have
[17:26] obtained that inheritance in Christ. The
[17:28] Bible says so the questions are what is
[17:31] the inheritance
[17:33] and why do we have to take it?
[17:36] You know, can't I just like stick around
[17:38] in the father's domain and let him bless
[17:41] me? Why do I have to be this responsible
[17:45] son to take over the inheritance?
[17:48] &gt;&gt; It it makes you think of the the
[17:50] prodical son story, right? Who went and
[17:53] and um he took his own inheritance and
[17:57] squandered it through the world
[17:59] &gt;&gt; but and his older brother got his
[18:02] inheritance. But after squandering it,
[18:04] he comes back and the father gives him
[18:06] what is his.
[18:10] In other words, the father's domain was
[18:12] going to be split three ways. The one
[18:13] brother got it. This one wasted that.
[18:15] But then eventually he got the the
[18:17] father's portion.
[18:21] So he was not left without an
[18:22] inheritance.
[18:24] Amen. No matter what happens, God is
[18:27] going to
[18:30] provide something. He has provided
[18:34] something. Amen. and you are going to
[18:37] fight against it in your life, your
[18:39] natural life. And this is what makes
[18:40] this road so incredible.
[18:44] So first we have to see that there is an
[18:48] actual inheritance and that we are the
[18:51] ones to take it. Right? Are we there?
[18:55] &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go to Christ declares the
[18:59] father. Okay. Now if you So now what
[19:03] we're showing you is the reason for the
[19:05] Lord Jesus Christ to come because
[19:08] without the Lord Jesus Christ coming you
[19:11] don't know the father.
[19:13] &gt;&gt; So the whole point of him coming was to
[19:16] declare the father.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; The the the reason for the first coming
[19:20] is to show the father to declare the
[19:23] father to mankind.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; What does that imply? That prior to
[19:28] Christ the father was not known.
[19:31] He was not known as the father
[19:34] because people could not see him see
[19:36] themselves as his sons there. They could
[19:40] have this idea that they were children
[19:42] of Israel, children of Abraham. Look at
[19:45] the contest in the time of Christ where
[19:47] he was questioning the Pharisees and
[19:49] they said first Abraham is our father
[19:52] and he says if you were Abraham's
[19:53] children you would. And then finally he
[19:55] said God is our father. And he said if
[19:57] you he said if you if God was your
[19:59] father you would believe my words that I
[20:01] speak unto you.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Then he says to them you are of your
[20:05] father the devil.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:09] &gt;&gt; The entire contest was about father. He
[20:12] claimed he came to declare the father to
[20:15] the world. Those people who claimed to
[20:18] be children of Abraham and then by that
[20:22] virtue claimed to be children of God
[20:24] were actually orphans who were never
[20:26] receiving the spirit of adoption.
[20:30] &gt;&gt; They didn't realize though they were
[20:32] they were children of Abraham by natural
[20:34] birth, they were children of the devil
[20:36] by spiritual birth.
[20:41] &gt;&gt; Christ declares the father. If you
[20:44] really take saints, if you really take a
[20:46] whole week to fast and pray the right
[20:49] way, not traditionally, and I tell you
[20:52] just to meditate on what Christ truly is
[20:56] to you and me, it will elevate you to
[20:59] another level of consciousness in this
[21:01] life.
[21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:04] &gt;&gt; To know what Jesus Christ is, that he
[21:07] came to declare the father.
[21:10] I I couldn't even explain it to you in I
[21:12] mean if you yourself
[21:16] meditate on the word and take even a
[21:18] week to just meditate on what Christ
[21:21] actually means
[21:23] that he came to declare the invisible
[21:25] God.
[21:26] &gt;&gt; Just the reality of that
[21:29] the Lord Jesus said clearly I came to
[21:32] declare the father. Why you cannot
[21:36] receive? Are you with me? You cannot
[21:39] receive sunship
[21:42] until you become conscious of the
[21:44] father.
[21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; You cannot claim to be a son or daughter
[21:50] of God unless you become conscious of
[21:53] the father.
[21:55] &gt;&gt; How could you ever know the father
[21:58] unless he became the son to show you the
[22:03] father? And then look at the beautiful
[22:05] part of all this. He's he's there with
[22:08] them and Philip asked Lord show us the
[22:12] father and it sufficeth us. Yes,
[22:15] &gt;&gt; this is this is what I'm saying his
[22:17] ministry was actually about. Even says
[22:19] to them, uh, look at, you know, don't
[22:23] judge me for these things. Judge me for
[22:25] the work's sake. Are these not the works
[22:26] of the father?
[22:28] &gt;&gt; In many different ways. And now he says
[22:31] to Philillip and them, he says, have I
[22:33] been with you so long and still you say,
[22:37] show us the father?
[22:39] In other words, he's he's the the word
[22:42] in the gospels is saying to us his
[22:44] ministry was showing the father.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Why were they still not catching it,
[22:50] right? So, how could you know the father
[22:54] unless he became the son? That's the
[22:56] purpose of becoming the son because the
[22:59] son declares the father. That in itself
[23:02] is another ministry because if you now
[23:05] claim to be the sons of God, it means
[23:09] your life must declare the father.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; That's what it is all about.
[23:17] &gt;&gt; Right? So how could you and I ever
[23:22] become conscious that you could have
[23:24] come from God
[23:27] from where we were born from where we
[23:29] came from? our countries, our
[23:32] ancestorries, all of those things. We
[23:35] can trace all those things back to
[23:36] heathens, pagans, you name it.
[23:40] How could you and I on our own ever
[23:43] without Christ, without the gospels,
[23:45] without the word, without the prophets,
[23:47] without the angels of the seven church
[23:49] ages, how could you and I in 2025 ever
[23:52] come to the epiphany that we came from
[23:54] God?
[23:58] Then we can obtain his inheritance.
[24:01] No man alive could do that.
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the purpose of Jesus
[24:06] Christ? to declare the father to connect
[24:09] mankind to know you have a father.
[24:14] I remember some time ago could have been
[24:16] last year I think when I was preaching
[24:17] on fatherhood and parenthood. You
[24:19] remember that and I told you what what
[24:21] fatherhood means. Fatherhood means to to
[24:26] provide um direction and purpose for a
[24:29] son. Right? So fatherhood is not just
[24:32] having a parent. And to me, this is this
[24:36] is a ridiculous thing about Christians
[24:38] today. To them, to have a father means
[24:40] heal my sickness, give me food, help me
[24:43] pay my rent, help me pay my bills, you
[24:47] know, give me clothing, make give me
[24:49] good luck in everything and then I'll
[24:52] serve you. And it's kind of like what
[24:55] children today believe. Children today
[24:58] want the house, they want clothes, they
[25:00] want the new cell phones, they want
[25:02] Wi-Fi, they want uh pleasures in life.
[25:05] But do they actually care about the
[25:07] father, father's reputation?
[25:10] Do they care about the father's job? Do
[25:13] they care about the father's house? Do
[25:15] they have any pride
[25:18] in their father's home? In their
[25:20] father's house, in his name? Do the
[25:23] children today have any pride in the
[25:25] name of their father?
[25:28] You know how um I I wish these
[25:32] traditions would still be kept. These
[25:33] are some of the traditions I like.
[25:36] You know uh in the Jewish homes when you
[25:38] when you come to a h to a house just on
[25:41] the side of the lintil is a hole in the
[25:45] wall with a scroll and inside the scroll
[25:49] is the names of all your ancestors in
[25:52] your father's bloodline.
[25:55] And when you every time doesn't matter
[25:57] how many times you walk into the house,
[25:58] you touch that scroll.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; I'm saying if you walked into the house,
[26:07] you touched a scroll. You went you
[26:08] forgot to some your wallet in the car,
[26:10] you went back to the car, you come back,
[26:11] you touch a scroll,
[26:14] &gt;&gt; you are entering your father's house,
[26:17] &gt;&gt; and with that blessing
[26:19] is the blessing of all your bloodline.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:23] And one day when you die, your name will
[26:25] be written on that scroll.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; People today, sons today do not have the
[26:33] respect anymore for their father's
[26:36] names.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; And I don't blame the sons.
[26:42] I I I blame the fathers for not teaching
[26:45] them what their bloodline is, what their
[26:48] heritage is, who they are. Why should I
[26:51] be proud in my father's name? Why not
[26:54] tell them the stories? Why not tell them
[26:56] where we come from? Tell them uh h how
[27:00] how you came to be in this place. It
[27:02] doesn't matter how some sometimes how
[27:04] bad the stories are or how terrible
[27:07] fathers we once had, but you are here
[27:09] today because of them.
[27:12] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how bad your life is.
[27:15] You are here today because of them. You
[27:17] owe them that much.
[27:23] You can hate them. You can hate what
[27:25] they did. You can hate that maybe they
[27:28] gave you a poor upbringing. Whatever it
[27:30] is, but you should have enough integrity
[27:34] and honor in you to honor your
[27:36] bloodline, where you come from.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; The house you were raised in,
[27:41] &gt;&gt; whatever situation, even if you came up
[27:43] in bad situations, it made you into the
[27:47] person you are today. It made you into
[27:50] the person who has a specific unique set
[27:52] of characteristics
[27:54] that nobody else has.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; So how could you ever become conscious
[28:03] of God without Christ being manifested?
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Impossible. And that's what believing in
[28:10] Christ really is about then. Because
[28:12] when you truly believe in Christ, then
[28:15] Romans 8 comes into full effect. All
[28:18] right, let's look at Romans 8 from verse
[28:20] 14- 16. This is another scripture just
[28:23] glossed over and evangelized [snorts]
[28:26] on and preached about with great
[28:28] enthusiasm and charisma, but zero
[28:31] understanding.
[28:33] For as many as are led by the spirit of
[28:35] God, they are the sons of God.
[28:40] We could spend years on that. For you
[28:43] have not received the spirit of bondage
[28:46] again to fear, but you have received the
[28:50] spirit of adoption,
[28:52] whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." The
[28:56] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[28:59] spirit that we are the children of God.
[29:02] Here is the starting point of the road
[29:04] to adoption.
[29:07] This doesn't mean you Paul is saying we
[29:09] have been adopted
[29:11] like these fellas running around saying
[29:14] you know the first church they had the
[29:16] open book they had everything they had
[29:18] the fullness if they did why weren't
[29:20] they raptured if they did why why did
[29:23] they descend so much in doctrine
[29:26] why didn't they had the unity of
[29:27] understanding of the word
[29:31] you have received the spirit of adoption
[29:34] okay so I want to bring this to to our
[29:36] understanding. Paul is not saying I'm an
[29:38] adopted son.
[29:40] I I have been adopted. He's not saying I
[29:43] have full adoption and I have full power
[29:45] over all this earth and I I've come to
[29:47] claim this whole earth is mine. He's not
[29:49] saying that. He's saying you have the
[29:51] spirit of adoption. There's a difference
[29:53] between the spirit of adoption and the
[29:57] fullness of adoption.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Right? You have received the spirit of
[30:02] adoption whereby we cry aba. Abba in the
[30:07] Hebrew is father. So let me rephrase
[30:10] this. You have received the spirit or
[30:14] the understanding or the revelation of
[30:17] who your father is. That's what it
[30:19] means. It has been made known to you who
[30:23] your father is. This is why you cry aba.
[30:27] Prior to this, you couldn't cry aba.
[30:31] You couldn't say father. You couldn't
[30:33] know father. So this is saying you have
[30:36] not received the spirit of bondage again
[30:38] to fear. You have received the spirit of
[30:40] adoption. You have received a
[30:41] revelation. You have received something
[30:43] from God that has opened up your eyes
[30:46] that he is your father.
[30:48] &gt;&gt; That's the beginning.
[30:52] You know, if I had to put this into into
[30:56] perspective, if you or into real
[30:58] understanding, if you had to adopt a
[31:01] little child, let's say a
[31:02] three-year-old, four-year-old child,
[31:04] that child doesn't know where you come
[31:05] from, who what your name is, what your
[31:08] surname is, the child only looks at you
[31:11] with glistening eyes and it wants food
[31:13] and it wants you to play. It wants some
[31:14] cuddles. It wants you to put it to
[31:16] sleep. It wants you to comfort it when
[31:18] it's crying. That's all it's looking
[31:20] for, right? And it's looking at mom and
[31:22] dad and it's it's judging between the
[31:26] two of you and it's going to grow. All
[31:29] it has is the spirit of adoption.
[31:34] It now recognizes you as its caregiver,
[31:38] as its protector.
[31:41] It's a spirit of adoption. That means
[31:42] when it walks in the outside world and
[31:44] it sees something scary, it's going to
[31:45] look for you. Ah, there you are. and run
[31:49] to you. It only has the spirit of
[31:51] adoption. What? That whenever there's a
[31:54] problem, Aba,
[31:57] right? That's the spirit of adoption.
[32:00] And so when when things are right or
[32:03] it's given you some kind of identity
[32:05] like this is where I stay. Why is that
[32:09] where you stay? Because that's where
[32:10] Abba stays.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; That's where father stays. That's where
[32:14] mother stays. So that's where I stay. If
[32:17] mother and father don't stay there
[32:19] anymore, I won't claim that as where I
[32:21] stay
[32:23] [snorts] because now they moved to a
[32:24] different home or a different house. So
[32:27] it's where they are that's where I stay.
[32:31] Spirit of adoption. Are you with us? So
[32:35] the road to adoption begins with
[32:38] receiving the spirit of adoption.
[32:41] Why is it linked to the not being the
[32:44] spirit of bondage? Because that's what
[32:46] orphanages are. It's bondage.
[32:50] If you're kept trapped in a place where
[32:52] you have no identity,
[32:55] you're just with a whole bunch of other
[32:57] people. You have no purpose. You have no
[33:00] direction. You have no singular person
[33:03] to look to. You're an orphan.
[33:08] Amen. And only after receiving the
[33:11] spirit of adoption do you realize that
[33:13] there is something reserved for you.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; And you know how it goes. Over birthdays
[33:20] and you know different times of
[33:22] celebration, father is going to give you
[33:25] a present. You're going to look for
[33:27] something. You're going to have gifts.
[33:29] Gifts. Are you getting it? Somebody say
[33:32] amen.
[33:34] You can have gifts very often while
[33:36] you're growing to maturity and then at a
[33:38] certain point the gifts stop.
[33:43] See road to adoption. All right, let's
[33:47] go to our inheritance. One major theme
[33:50] of the Bible seems to be about I mean
[33:54] you should know this, right? We're doing
[33:56] we're in uh on our Wednesday nights
[33:58] we're on Genesis the book of Genesis.
[34:00] We're doing a Bible study in the book of
[34:01] Genesis and we've reached Genesis 12. Up
[34:04] to Genesis 12, how many lineages have we
[34:07] already been through,
[34:09] right? And this one begat that one, and
[34:11] this one begat that one, and this one
[34:13] begat that one, and this one married
[34:15] this woman, and they begat this one, and
[34:17] this was the the the lineage of Noah,
[34:19] and the lineage of Abram. We've already
[34:21] just been through 12 chapters and we
[34:23] already see from the beginning there is
[34:25] a there is um an emphasis placed on
[34:28] lineage on bloodlines.
[34:32] Why? Because of inheritance.
[34:35] You wouldn't need to track bloodlines or
[34:38] lineages if there was no inheritance to
[34:40] pass down.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; So sometime after the flood, God
[34:45] promises to Abraham that I will make you
[34:47] a father of many nations. Now, that's a
[34:50] problem.
[34:52] Think of that. I mean, some of you
[34:54] complain about having two kids. Imagine
[34:57] having 12
[35:00] and more. You know, Abraham didn't just
[35:03] stop with Isaac. He then married
[35:04] Coutura. He had Ishmael through Hagga,
[35:06] married Coutura, and had other sons and
[35:08] daughters. Can can you imagine dividing
[35:11] your inheritance amongst all these
[35:13] children?
[35:16] Hey, some of you complain about the will
[35:18] that you have to make for just three
[35:20] kids
[35:22] and hoping they stay and they keep their
[35:25] their holy ghost after you die so that
[35:28] they can get on peaceibly and you know
[35:30] not fight like a bunch of heathens after
[35:33] you're dead over money.
[35:37] Can you imagine having 12 or more kids?
[35:40] And he tells him, you're going to be the
[35:42] father of many nations. Okay? Which
[35:45] means immediately if you're going to be
[35:47] the father of many nations, you had
[35:50] better keep your bloodlines perfect
[35:53] because we are not passing down our land
[35:56] to somebody who has confused the
[35:58] bloodlines.
[36:00] This land does not go to anyone but our
[36:03] bloodline.
[36:06] Do you understand the problem in Israel
[36:09] right now? the Middle East
[36:13] all has to do with bloodlines. So, we
[36:15] can see the pattern start there in a
[36:18] literal earthly sense. Abraham's
[36:21] bloodline. Okay, let's read Galatians
[36:24] 3:29.
[36:25] If you be Christs,
[36:28] then are you Abraham's seed and hes
[36:32] according to the promise. So Paul is now
[36:36] linking us to God's promise to Abraham.
[36:41] I don't know about you. I'm from my
[36:43] family comes from central India.
[36:46] I don't know whether I'm physically
[36:48] linked to Abraham somehow. I'm probably
[36:51] linked to Noah through Japheth
[36:54] somewhere. And some of you are from
[36:57] Africa, some of you originate from
[36:58] Europe. There's no Jews among us this
[37:02] morning,
[37:03] I think.
[37:06] And uh so none of you have any physical
[37:08] links to Abraham, literal links to but
[37:12] he says through Christ
[37:15] you become
[37:17] an inheritor.
[37:19] You are Abraham's seed through Christ.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; I wonder what those Jews have to say
[37:25] about that.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Right. So he says this after saying this
[37:33] that we are we have this link to
[37:35] Abraham's inheritance. Can you imagine
[37:37] walking into Israel right now and say
[37:39] listen one day Jerusalem is going to be
[37:41] mine friends because I believe in
[37:44] Christ.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; You guys don't get too comfortable here.
[37:50] That's not going to make them happy.
[37:52] Let's go to Hebrews 11
[37:55] verse 10. And this is what's beautiful.
[37:59] For he looked for a city which has
[38:02] foundations, whose builder and maker is
[38:04] God. Who's that? That's speaking of
[38:07] Abraham.
[38:09] So Abraham had this land of Israel, the
[38:11] plains of memory, Hebron,
[38:14] which is, you know, Hebrew, which means
[38:16] from the oaks, and the people from that
[38:19] region were then called the Hebrews. And
[38:22] that later became Israel and Judea from
[38:27] uh uh Yehudi which is where the word Jew
[38:31] comes from. Judea. And so they were
[38:34] first called Hebrews and then Yehud
[38:37] which means Judah or or or and then
[38:40] later Jews.
[38:42] Uh and this man had this land. He had
[38:45] this inheritance. God took him from the
[38:47] Chaldes and brought him out to to uh
[38:50] Hebron and Judea. and he got this land
[38:52] and here am I. I mean, I'm I'm here. And
[38:54] then the scripture says he's looking for
[38:55] a city which has foundations whose
[38:59] builder and maker is God. Clearly, even
[39:01] after he got that, he was still looking
[39:03] for something.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; And he believed he was an inheritor of
[39:08] that.
[39:11] That's what we are inheritors of. What
[39:13] he was looking for. Amen.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; So where in Genesis does it say that
[39:19] Abraham looked for a city built by God?
[39:22] Where where does it say that? Where does
[39:24] Paul get this from?
[39:26] Then Paul goes on to say that all those
[39:29] of Abraham's seed looked for a country.
[39:31] So you go and read further down from
[39:34] Hebrews 11:10, you're going to see he
[39:36] says they all looked for a country, but
[39:39] they died not having received the
[39:41] promises.
[39:43] Yeah.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; So clearly he was not talking about the
[39:46] literal land of Israel.
[39:48] &gt;&gt; Verse 16 says, "But now they, that means
[39:53] all those great heroes of the faith,
[39:56] having received some promises for their
[39:58] day, they desire a better country that
[40:02] is and heavenly."
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Now you see us coming back to that story
[40:08] of man and God. They desire in heavenly
[40:12] country.
[40:13] Wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[40:16] called their God. For he has prepared
[40:20] for them a city.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. A city which has
[40:25] foundations whose builder and maker is
[40:28] God.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; And Christians took this and thought,
[40:32] well,
[40:33] &gt;&gt; when we're inside those gates of pearl,
[40:35] we'll learn a lot of things.
[40:40] Amen. There'll be roads of paved with
[40:43] gold and gates of pearls and all the
[40:47] great riches and wonders and precious
[40:50] stones and lights and just you know
[40:53] we'll be walking around and playing
[40:55] harps and I don't know that's what
[40:58] Christians believe nowadays that heaven
[41:01] is going to be this mystical magical
[41:03] place that God is going to take us away
[41:05] to leaving all our miseries behind and
[41:09] we'll be so oblivious of all the
[41:11] suffering of all those naughty people on
[41:13] earth
[41:16] cuz we were God's good boys.
[41:19] H
[41:21] no they said they were looking for a
[41:23] city a country
[41:27] the word foundations
[41:29] a city which have foundations.
[41:33] All cities have foundations. What are
[41:34] you talking about?
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:37] Foundations
[41:38] means or implies incorruptible,
[41:42] unbreakable
[41:44] and something which comes from before
[41:46] the beginning.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:50] &gt;&gt; Where were you Job when I laid the
[41:53] foundations?
[41:55] &gt;&gt; From before the beginning,
[41:58] &gt;&gt; the foundation it has origins.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; Abram was looking for that place, that
[42:04] city. So we know that, excuse me, the
[42:07] Bible said this, but if you and I are
[42:10] heirs, H E I R S, inheritors,
[42:16] right? I um I know when I when I first
[42:19] came to Durban.
[42:24] I heard the people saying we are hairs.
[42:29] Please forgive um our Indian brothers
[42:31] because uh in the Indian languages we
[42:34] drop hes and pick them up you know in
[42:37] different places.
[42:39] So um like where are you at
[42:47] where are you at? So in the Indian
[42:49] languages they the vowels are different
[42:51] and so on. So the reason I'm saying
[42:53] this, I'm trying to teach you the heirs.
[42:57] H E I R S is pronounced heirs. We are
[43:00] heirs of the father. We are not hes of
[43:02] the father. Okay. But we are inheritors.
[43:06] You don't mind teaching a little bit of
[43:09] English. Okay. We want to speak it
[43:12] right. Especially when you sing in the
[43:14] song, we are we are heirs of the father,
[43:16] joint hes with the son. You are
[43:18] inheritors.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know what that the Bible said
[43:23] this. But if we are inheritors,
[43:26] what is our inheritance and where is it?
[43:29] If Abram didn't receive it in his day
[43:32] and his natural children couldn't obtain
[43:35] it in their day, is there an inheritance
[43:38] outstanding?
[43:41] Where is it? Clearly, the Bible says
[43:43] they did not receive it.
[43:46] Right? Go and read it. Now, so there is
[43:50] an inheritance outstanding.
[43:54] Outstanding means it's still available.
[43:56] It's still to be taken, right? And it
[44:00] would not be said that we are heirs of
[44:03] the father of through the promise of
[44:06] Christ. It would not be said that we are
[44:08] inheritors if there was not an
[44:10] inheritance outstanding. You agree?
[44:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:13] &gt;&gt; All right. So let's look at the first
[44:16] step forward toward our inheritance.
[44:20] So
[44:22] what is the first step? How do we get to
[44:25] know our inheritance?
[44:27] Colossians 1:12,
[44:29] giving thanks unto the Father, which
[44:32] hath made us meat to be partakers of the
[44:37] inheritance of the saints in light, who
[44:40] hath delivered us from the power of
[44:42] darkness, and hath translated us into
[44:45] the kingdom of his dear son. So, let's
[44:47] break this down to make it clear, right?
[44:51] Made us meet.
[44:53] That didn't mean make us get together.
[44:57] The word meet means possible.
[45:01] Made it possible.
[45:04] Made it likely. Made it. Uh um like for
[45:08] example um in [clears throat] the
[45:10] beginning where it says the woman was
[45:12] made a help meet,
[45:15] &gt;&gt; right? It's it's not about um gathering
[45:18] or meeting together. It wasn't even help
[45:21] made
[45:23] and not just possible but so when Adam
[45:27] was alone and he needed a help meet it
[45:32] means somebody
[45:34] who qualified
[45:39] a qualifying help
[45:42] uh someone relatable.
[45:45] Are you with us? So you put all that in,
[45:48] he made us qualified. He made us
[45:51] relatable.
[45:53] He made us He made it possible for us to
[45:57] be inheritors,
[45:59] partakers of the inheritance.
[46:02] That's what it means to be a meat.
[46:05] Okay, got it.
[46:08] Obviously, I'm I'm really I I could
[46:11] express this differently. Believe me,
[46:13] I'm really dumbing this down.
[46:16] Like the prophet says, "So the little
[46:18] guy can get it." Okay. So God made us
[46:24] relatable to the inheritance. He did
[46:27] something.
[46:29] What what possibly could he do for us in
[46:32] this life to make us to link us to the
[46:35] inheritance?
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Verse 13. Who has delivered us from the
[46:42] power of darkness. All right. So here it
[46:44] is.
[46:45] They were these saints. He's he's saying
[46:48] we are partakers of the inheritance of
[46:49] the saints in light. So the clue there
[46:52] is in light. What is in light?
[46:56] Okay. The Hebrews were the first seed of
[46:59] Abraham. They were the first recipients
[47:02] of light. What is light? The next verse
[47:04] tells you from the power of darkness.
[47:07] What is darkness? Darkness is ignorance.
[47:12] There it is. you. Why were you ignorant?
[47:15] Because you didn't know you had a
[47:16] father. You're an orphan. You came into
[47:18] this world speaking lies, doing
[47:20] everything unrighteous, unconscious of
[47:22] God. You know nothing about him. You
[47:24] know nothing about inheritance. So you
[47:26] are in ignorance. What does it mean to
[47:28] be enlightened?
[47:31] To know your father is to be in light.
[47:34] So why were the Hebrews the first people
[47:36] to be in light?
[47:40] Because they were the first people given
[47:42] the word.
[47:45] Right? So the prophets and the law were
[47:48] given to Israel. They were the first
[47:51] saints in light
[47:54] who had an inkling or an idea that there
[47:56] is an inheritance outstanding.
[47:59] So the first step here it is towards our
[48:03] inheritance is receiving the spoken word
[48:07] &gt;&gt; because what is the spoken word? It is
[48:09] that which gives you light. It's that
[48:12] which reveals your inheritance to you.
[48:15] Are you still following?
[48:16] &gt;&gt; So in the New Testament it shows that
[48:19] God made it possible. God made us
[48:24] worthy candidates
[48:27] through Christ. How? Through the word,
[48:31] right? Through Calvary, he made us meat.
[48:37] Though we were unworthy Gentiles. In
[48:39] other words, let me try and simplify
[48:41] this down. Right? So you have the
[48:42] Hebrews who for almost 1,500 years or
[48:46] 2,000 years since Abraham received the
[48:50] law, followed the law, recognized the
[48:53] father as God, kept the law as best they
[48:56] could, listened to the prophets, wrote
[48:58] the word down, produced the scrolls,
[49:01] produced the prophecies looking for the
[49:03] Messiah to come. They fought wars. They
[49:07] lived through empires. They lived
[49:09] through uh Babylonian Empire captivity,
[49:12] Meo Persian captivity, Grecian
[49:13] captivity, and Roman captivity at the
[49:16] time when Christ comes in. They suffered
[49:18] through it all believing that Jehovah
[49:20] was their father
[49:22] &gt;&gt; and that he was going to reveal himself
[49:24] to them via the Messiah and bring them
[49:26] their inheritance. They kept it. The
[49:28] word was dripping with blood. They were
[49:31] in light.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; They were the only nation on earth that
[49:34] was worshiping God.
[49:40] Amen. And then through Christ, he makes
[49:44] it possible that we become partakers of
[49:47] the inheritance of the saints in light.
[49:51] How? He brings us the spoken word.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. So darkness means a lack of
[49:59] revelation or understanding, a lack of
[50:01] spoken word. Saints in light are those
[50:04] who have been enlightened. Are you
[50:06] listening? This is it. Sense enlight
[50:10] means those who have been enlightened to
[50:13] their inheritance
[50:15] and purpose. So the first thing is you
[50:18] receive the spirit of adoption whereby
[50:20] you cry aba
[50:22] now. So the first thing is I have the
[50:25] spirit of adoption. I recognize I have a
[50:27] father.
[50:29] He is God. But now I know nothing about
[50:32] him. I know nothing about his
[50:34] inheritance. How am I going to get to
[50:36] know him? How am I going to get to know
[50:38] his inheritance? Spoken word.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Next step. So, first steps, spirit of
[50:44] adoption. Next step, spoken word. You
[50:47] are going to receive spoken word. Spoken
[50:49] word is going to be brought to you over
[50:51] your lifetime. You are going to receive
[50:53] that and that is going to put you in
[50:54] light.
[50:58] Are you with me? We are talking about
[51:00] the road to adoption. Amen.
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Let's go to understanding. So our
[51:06] inheritance we come to understand is
[51:08] eternal. This is how we know that
[51:10] Abraham looked for a city whose builder
[51:11] and maker was God. Meaning the city is
[51:14] eternal. The country is eternal. It is a
[51:16] heavenly country. It is a heavenly city.
[51:18] You with us? Hebrews 9:15 says, "And for
[51:21] this cause he, Christ is the mediator of
[51:25] the New Testament, that by means of
[51:28] death for the redemption of the
[51:30] transgressions that were under the first
[51:32] testament, they which are called might
[51:34] receive the promise of eternal
[51:37] inheritance."
[51:39] Rephrasing all this, Christ is the
[51:41] mediator of the New Testament. The
[51:43] testament is a will. Mediator is the
[51:46] executive. He's not just the executive.
[51:49] He is the one who dies. And the the
[51:52] testament only comes into the effect
[51:54] when the testator dies. So in other
[51:57] words, you can't go to your parents and
[51:59] say, "Listen, I want what is mine?"
[52:02] They're not dead yet.
[52:05] The will only comes into effect when
[52:06] they're dead.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; That's what it's saying. So he had to
[52:09] die to make the inheritance come into
[52:11] effect.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; And then he gave us the will. And the
[52:15] promise of eternal inheritance is the
[52:18] Holy Ghost.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; The earnest of our inheritance.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; The promise of our inheritance is the
[52:25] Holy Ghost. What does that even mean? It
[52:27] means when you receive the Holy Ghost is
[52:30] when your inheritance start to become
[52:32] meaningful to you.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; Prior to that, you got this roof
[52:39] that you have a father, but you got no
[52:42] idea what he has to offer you.
[52:44] You're so happy you got a father who's
[52:46] going to take care of you, heal your
[52:47] body, give you blessings and whatever.
[52:49] Wait till you get to know what the
[52:51] inheritance is
[52:53] &gt;&gt; because there's a responsibility that
[52:55] comes with that inheritance.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that tells us that this
[53:00] inheritance is heavenly. It is eternal
[53:03] inheritance.
[53:05] Glory to God. Because it is eternal, it
[53:08] is something from another dimension.
[53:12] Let's go to Matthew 5 and verse three.
[53:15] Blessed are the poor in spirit for
[53:17] theirs is the kingdom of heaven. So
[53:19] Christ came preaching there is a kingdom
[53:21] of heaven. And it says the poor in
[53:23] spirit will inherit the kingdom of
[53:26] heaven.
[53:28] It tells you there is a kingdom of
[53:29] heaven and the poor in spirit. This is
[53:32] those who are humble.
[53:34] So, it's telling you there's a character
[53:36] of people
[53:38] that will inherit the kingdom of heaven.
[53:40] Now, it doesn't stop there. It also
[53:42] says, "Blessed are the meek, for they
[53:44] shall inherit the earth." Oh. So,
[53:47] there's not just a heavenly inheritance.
[53:50] There's also an earthly inheritance.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; These two scriptures in the message of
[53:56] Christ shows us the inheritance is in
[53:59] two parts. an inheritance that is
[54:01] heavenly and an inheritance that is
[54:03] earthly. But Paul says to us that it is
[54:07] eternal. It's actually telling us
[54:10] there's something heavenly that is
[54:11] eternal and there's something earthly
[54:13] that is eternal.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Wow. There's something about earth that
[54:17] is eternal that will live forever.
[54:22] So what do we know about our inheritance
[54:24] so far? Number one, our inheritance is
[54:28] reserved for the saints, the called out
[54:31] ones only.
[54:33] Number two, the first step is receiving
[54:36] spoken word.
[54:39] First step for our inheritance, right?
[54:41] Number three, it's for those who have
[54:43] had the same faith as Abraham.
[54:47] Number four, it's for those who have
[54:50] been enlightened to it. That means those
[54:52] who receive the spoken word. Number
[54:56] five, there is a heavenly eternal
[54:58] inheritance. Number six, there is an
[55:01] earthly inheritance. Number seven, it
[55:04] takes the right character to inherit it.
[55:08] The poor in spirit and the meek.
[55:12] Character will inherit. Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; So the word we're talking about the road
[55:20] to adoption. He's not just going to hand
[55:22] a son the inheritance until he comes to
[55:25] the fullness of adoption.
[55:28] You don't just adopt a baby and say,
[55:30] "There you go. There's my bank account.
[55:35] Go do with it." That child will go and
[55:39] buy out Toys R Us.
[55:43] That mind is not ready for the
[55:44] inheritance.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; You can only hand out an inheritance to
[55:49] someone who's come to your mind.
[55:54] How are we going to get this child to
[55:55] your mind? It has to receive the word
[55:59] &gt;&gt; until it's ready.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with us?
[56:03] &gt;&gt; So, here's another thing about this
[56:05] inheritance. It is incorruptible.
[56:08] Uh 1 Corinthians 15:50-54.
[56:11] Now this I say brethren that flesh and
[56:13] blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.
[56:17] Neither doth corruption inherit
[56:19] incorruption. There this is where we
[56:21] start with. There is no way that you if
[56:24] you are corrupt will inherit
[56:26] incorruption.
[56:27] Which means something has to transform
[56:29] you from corruption to incorruption
[56:31] &gt;&gt; for you to inherit incorruption.
[56:35] Behold I show you a mystery. That means
[56:37] this is not easily understood.
[56:40] We shall not all sleep. That means not
[56:43] all of us will die.
[56:46] Some of us will. But we shall all be
[56:48] changed. That means those who die and
[56:51] those who are living will all be
[56:52] changed.
[56:54] So he's talking about this inheritance,
[56:56] right? In a moment, in the twinkling of
[56:59] an eye, at the last trump, for the
[57:01] trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be
[57:02] raised the dead. So those who died in
[57:04] Christ will be raised incorruptible, and
[57:06] we who are living shall be changed. So
[57:08] all of us will be changed.
[57:11] And what's what are we going to be
[57:12] changed into? This corruptible will will
[57:15] put on incorruption. So what is this
[57:18] inheritance? It's an incorruptible body.
[57:22] And this mortal shall put on
[57:24] immortality. Which means Abram, as great
[57:28] as he was, as wonderful as his life was
[57:31] serving God, was still looking for
[57:34] theophony.
[57:36] He was not in touch with it yet. And
[57:39] this man had seen the Messiah or rather
[57:41] the prefigure of Messiah. He had seen
[57:43] Elohim on the plains of memory. He
[57:45] understood there was a glorified body.
[57:51] So when this corruption shall put on
[57:52] incorruption and this mortal shall have
[57:55] put on immortality, then shall be
[57:57] brought to pass the saying that is
[57:59] written, death is swallowed up in
[58:01] victory. That means there is coming a
[58:03] time. He knows Paul is saying there is
[58:05] coming a time when corruption will have
[58:08] taken on incorruption.
[58:10] Uh im mortality will have put on
[58:13] immortality and everything else. Then
[58:15] death is swallowed up in victory. It's
[58:17] saying all that is time
[58:20] and death and corruption is done with.
[58:23] It's over. Dimensions are changed. In
[58:26] other words,
[58:28] &gt;&gt; praise be to God. So this is showing us
[58:30] there is something incorruptible and
[58:32] heavenly that we must inherit. So when
[58:35] you were born in this life and you
[58:38] started on the road to adoption
[58:40] uh when you know when you meet a
[58:42] Christian in the street and they ask you
[58:44] are you born again
[58:46] and then they sell you the gospel story
[58:49] and they tell you if you believe in
[58:51] Christ uh one day there'll be a
[58:54] resurrection for you right and Christ
[58:56] died and is the only one only man who
[58:59] died and rose again and they tell you if
[59:01] you become you say the sinner's prayer
[59:03] you receive salv salvation. You are born
[59:06] again. You will receive the promise of
[59:08] resurrection someday,
[59:10] right?
[59:13] You you have this idea that there's
[59:15] something, but you don't know anything
[59:16] about it. I know every single person I
[59:20] know who came through the process of
[59:22] salvation, who received Christ as their
[59:25] savior had no idea that there was a
[59:27] thing called theophony.
[59:30] Nobody. Nobody knew anything. And even
[59:33] if they had heard it, they had no idea
[59:34] what it was. Nobody had any idea about
[59:37] the seventh dimension and the sixth
[59:38] dimension and uh uh what heaven really
[59:41] is about. All of us were filled with
[59:43] Bible stories and things our parents
[59:45] taught us and all the stories of the
[59:47] ancestors. Nobody had any clue what
[59:49] incorruption really is.
[59:54] So this is also showing us that our
[59:56] present earthly body cannot inherit the
[1:00:01] heavenly
[1:00:03] without a change.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; You cannot attain the inheritance of the
[1:00:16] saints in light without a change.
[1:00:20] You have to be changed from glory to
[1:00:22] glory.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The only way God has provided for you to
[1:00:28] receive this change is to receive spoken
[1:00:30] word.
[1:00:32] &gt;&gt; Spoken word is the original seed. Spoken
[1:00:34] word is what can speak things into
[1:00:36] existence. Spoken word is what can
[1:00:38] change your nature. Spoken word is what
[1:00:40] can make you poor in spirit and meek.
[1:00:43] Spoken word is what can make you inherit
[1:00:45] the kingdom of God and inherit the
[1:00:47] earth.
[1:00:50] This is the reason we're here.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, there's no need for
[1:00:55] church.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; There's no need for the Bible. There's
[1:00:58] no need for the word. There's no need
[1:01:00] for the prophets. There's no need for
[1:01:01] the messengers. It's the only reason
[1:01:03] spoken word exists because that is the
[1:01:06] way he has provided for you to inherit.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So at the last trump he says the
[1:01:14] last angel's message our corruptible
[1:01:17] flesh shall be changed to incorruptible
[1:01:19] flesh by the word and our mortal spirits
[1:01:22] shall be changed to immortal.
[1:01:25] Amen. This is not speaking about a
[1:01:28] sudden flesh change like people think in
[1:01:32] the moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[1:01:34] the last trump they think it's bam
[1:01:38] Christ blits the skies. Trumpets blow,
[1:01:41] angels pour out, you know, it, you know,
[1:01:44] it's like a nice science fiction movie
[1:01:47] and then all of us fly up.
[1:01:50] You know, we lose our density.
[1:01:54] I wish a lot of people would lose their
[1:01:55] density today,
[1:01:58] but that's a hope.
[1:02:01] This is not speaking about this flesh
[1:02:03] change. It's a process of change by the
[1:02:06] word. That's the purpose of hearing the
[1:02:09] word and believing it.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelations 21:7.
[1:02:18] And this is what happens. This is now
[1:02:20] your next step, right? So you receive
[1:02:22] spirit of adoption
[1:02:25] that tells you who your father is. It
[1:02:27] connects you with your father. You then
[1:02:29] receive spoken word and spoken word is
[1:02:31] connecting you with your inheritance.
[1:02:33] Your inheritance that he has provided
[1:02:35] for you.
[1:02:37] Now, there's something for you to do by
[1:02:40] the spoken word that you receive, and
[1:02:42] that is to overcome.
[1:02:45] Verse 7 of Revelations 21, he that
[1:02:48] overcomemeth shall inherit all things.
[1:02:52] And I will be his God, and he shall be
[1:02:55] my son. For those of you who don't know,
[1:02:58] those last words, I will be his God, and
[1:03:00] he shall be my son. That's adoption
[1:03:02] words. Amen.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; That's like when Christ was there and
[1:03:06] said, "This is my beloved son in whom I
[1:03:08] am well pleased. Hear ye him." This is
[1:03:10] adoption words. I will be his God. He
[1:03:13] shall be my son. He shall inherit all
[1:03:16] things. Can you see how adoption is
[1:03:19] linked to inheritance?
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; You can only overcome by the spoken word
[1:03:25] you have believed in.
[1:03:28] So this is saying overcoming speaks of
[1:03:32] what is overcoming he that overcometh?
[1:03:34] What is what is overcoming speaking of?
[1:03:36] Enduring with patience and coming to
[1:03:40] maturity.
[1:03:42] I'm saying it again. Overcoming is
[1:03:46] enduring the challenge of your day with
[1:03:50] patience
[1:03:51] and coming to maturity.
[1:03:54] Maturity is what's going to bring you to
[1:03:56] adoption. You're not going to give the
[1:03:59] open book to people who are just
[1:04:01] starting out.
[1:04:03] People who have were in the first stage
[1:04:05] of growth. You're not going to give the
[1:04:08] open book the title deed to the first
[1:04:11] church age.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm hearing now in the
[1:04:14] message that people say the the apostles
[1:04:17] had already had the open book.
[1:04:20] I I don't see where it is in the I can
[1:04:23] see some of you have never heard that
[1:04:24] before. But this is what so many of them
[1:04:27] are saying. The open book was already in
[1:04:30] the hands of the disciples or the
[1:04:32] apostles after Acts chapter 2. They had
[1:04:34] the open book and then what happened?
[1:04:37] They lost it
[1:04:40] because that's what they're teaching.
[1:04:41] And they had there were the bride tree
[1:04:43] and then that bride tree was stripped
[1:04:45] down by the seals and then it restarted
[1:04:47] in Luther. It's so good when you hear
[1:04:49] it. But then where do you get it from?
[1:04:53] That they were given the open book, then
[1:04:55] they lost it again, and then it went
[1:04:56] back and now it's coming back again.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; The way the prophet teaches it is from
[1:05:02] the beginning, Adam lost it.
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; Man never had it.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; And the preparation was to bring us to
[1:05:09] it now at the end time when the bride is
[1:05:11] on earth.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; So I don't know where this doctrine
[1:05:15] came. It's very interesting to me that I
[1:05:18] learned now in the last few months that
[1:05:20] this is what is being preached that the
[1:05:23] the disciples the apostles had the open
[1:05:25] book and they were the original
[1:05:28] manifested sons on earth. Why manifested
[1:05:30] sons?
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they had powers to heal.
[1:05:36] They were the infant church.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; They were the church in its infancy.
[1:05:40] They were only sent to tell the people
[1:05:44] that there is a death, burial, and
[1:05:46] resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:05:48] They were commissioned to go out and and
[1:05:50] give the gospel that he died and rose
[1:05:53] again. That's it.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; They were not preaching the seals. They
[1:05:58] were not preaching the thunders.
[1:06:00] You could call it dynamics if you want
[1:06:03] to. The dynamics they had was related to
[1:06:07] the word they had for that day. True.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; And people are saying that I am
[1:06:14] preaching
[1:06:15] that Acts chapter 2 is not enough. That
[1:06:18] I am preaching that Acts chapter 2 is
[1:06:20] not the indwelling.
[1:06:22] That it was just an anointing and it's
[1:06:23] not the indwelling. They had an anoint.
[1:06:26] I already said this to you. They had the
[1:06:28] anointing and they had the indwelling of
[1:06:31] the word they had for their day.
[1:06:35] They had the indwelling of the spirit of
[1:06:37] the amount of word they had for their
[1:06:40] day. They had not even received the
[1:06:42] fullness of the word.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; You in this day receive the anointing
[1:06:46] and the indwelling of the whole word of
[1:06:49] God that has been expressed through
[1:06:52] 2,000 years.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; That's the fullness of the indwelling
[1:06:56] which they did not have.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying they had no indwelling.
[1:07:02] Every son of God had an indwelling in
[1:07:04] his day. Luther had an indwelling and an
[1:07:06] anointing. Wesley had an indwelling and
[1:07:09] an anoint indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[1:07:11] himself in them in a portion.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; That's congruent with everything the
[1:07:18] prophet teaches.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; You can overcome only by the spoken word
[1:07:25] for your day which you believe in. So if
[1:07:28] you overcome, you inherit, right?
[1:07:32] And we know in every church he says to
[1:07:34] him that overcomemeth this and this to
[1:07:36] him that overcometh this and this. So if
[1:07:38] you endured with the message for your
[1:07:41] day you inherited something which means
[1:07:44] constantly God was showing sons there is
[1:07:46] an inheritance.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; So far they were building up to the
[1:07:50] earthly inheritance but keeping them in
[1:07:53] touch with the heavenly.
[1:07:55] Right? So those words, I will be his God
[1:07:59] and he shall be my son, are adoption
[1:08:01] words. This makes adoption crucial for
[1:08:05] without it there can be no obtaining an
[1:08:08] inheritance.
[1:08:10] So what's the full process? Receive the
[1:08:13] word and believe and overcome by the
[1:08:16] word and receive the adoption. So I'm
[1:08:18] just going to put it out there. I'm just
[1:08:20] going to say it. If you are receiving,
[1:08:23] if you go to just any Christian church
[1:08:26] or you're receiving some kind of word,
[1:08:30] but it's not the spoken word of God,
[1:08:34] you are not being linked to your
[1:08:35] inheritance.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; This is it. Because the spoken word of
[1:08:43] God links you to your inheritance.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; You will try as you might. You will even
[1:08:49] try to conjure up thoughts and images.
[1:08:52] This is the reason why you've got
[1:08:53] thousands of Christians in the world
[1:08:55] believing in fables.
[1:09:00] So let's look at sunshine
[1:09:04] adoption part four paragraph 75. Look
[1:09:07] has predestinated un us unto this
[1:09:10] inheritance. If I'm a right inheritance
[1:09:13] of something, if God is knocking at my
[1:09:15] heart and saying, William Brandham, I
[1:09:16] called you a long time ago before the
[1:09:18] foundation of the world to preach the
[1:09:19] gospel. I have an inheritance, an
[1:09:21] inheritance of eternal life. Now, God
[1:09:24] sent Jesus to make that inheritance real
[1:09:27] to me.
[1:09:32] Right? God sent Jesus to make that
[1:09:35] inheritance real to me.
[1:09:40] Amen. Because there was nothing I could
[1:09:43] do to inherit it.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; I was an orphan.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; It was blank.
[1:09:50] It was in It was valid. There's nothing
[1:09:52] I can do. But in the fullness of time,
[1:09:55] God sent in his own good time, Jesus,
[1:09:57] the lamb slain from the foundation of
[1:09:59] the world. His blood was shed that I
[1:10:02] might go to my inheritance. Now, here it
[1:10:04] is. To be what? What inheritance? to
[1:10:08] sunship
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; to be a son of God.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Now what was becoming sons about?
[1:10:15] Remember last week becoming sons was
[1:10:18] about receiving theophony.
[1:10:21] Theophony is theophony is the heavenly
[1:10:23] inheritance.
[1:10:25] Theophony is actually the son of god.
[1:10:29] Right now you see theophony does not
[1:10:32] need adoption
[1:10:35] because theophony knows its father.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; What needs adoption is this body.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; Because this body does not have a link
[1:10:44] to its father.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; The only link there is is the attribute.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; So this body needs the spirit of
[1:10:52] adoption to come to the same
[1:10:54] understanding as the theophony. that
[1:10:57] theophony is the son of God.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; This is the son of man,
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; right? The son of Charles and Elabbrand,
[1:11:04] the son of uh Steven and Jennifer
[1:11:07] Francis, the son of the Francises. This
[1:11:09] is this body.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; But then someday you come to an
[1:11:13] understanding. I am not the son of so
[1:11:15] and so. I am the son of God. How do you
[1:11:18] come to that understanding?
[1:11:20] You're coming to the same understanding
[1:11:22] of that theophony.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Because that theophony is the son of
[1:11:27] God.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; That's what becoming sons means. So your
[1:11:33] inheritance,
[1:11:35] this body's inheritance, this what this
[1:11:37] body is looking to is to become a son.
[1:11:44] Amen. Becoming sons is about the
[1:11:46] offenes. So this one word speaks of
[1:11:50] everything we have been speaking about,
[1:11:52] right? But the first part of our
[1:11:54] inheritance is sunship. That's the first
[1:11:56] part of our inheritance. So now here's
[1:12:00] the thing.
[1:12:01] Adam
[1:12:03] inherited the earth, right?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; What made Adam go of the earth? The
[1:12:10] theophony. Yeah.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; So you cannot even inherit the earth
[1:12:16] first without getting the theophony.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; So without getting the heavenly
[1:12:21] inheritance, you cannot inherit the
[1:12:23] earthly inheritance.
[1:12:25] Let me put it to you
[1:12:28] personally.
[1:12:30] You cannot have the eternal fleshly body
[1:12:36] for each one of you personally unless
[1:12:38] you first inherit the theophony.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Because it's the theophony that's going
[1:12:43] to make the flesh eternal.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Understood?
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; That's what you are looking for
[1:12:52] permanently.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham was searching for. a
[1:12:58] city whose which had foundations whose
[1:13:02] builder and maker was God. Because if he
[1:13:05] obtained theophony, he would live
[1:13:08] forever in the flesh.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Though he had obtained Israel, he was
[1:13:15] still looking for a city whose builder
[1:13:16] and maker was God.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is becoming sons
[1:13:23] connects you with your theophony, your
[1:13:26] heavenly inheritance which then gives
[1:13:28] you the earth.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the title deed.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? So this is not about
[1:13:38] seeing Jesus as God. The first thing we
[1:13:41] inherit is sunship of Christ. We see the
[1:13:44] sunship of Christ through belief in the
[1:13:47] revelation of Christ as God. And that's
[1:13:49] not saying, "Ah, okay. So Jesus is God.
[1:13:52] Prove it to me." And then we go through
[1:13:54] this whole, you know, godship uh
[1:13:56] doctrine and prove this by that
[1:13:58] scripture and that.
[1:14:00] To me, that's exhausting
[1:14:03] to have to to have to go through some to
[1:14:05] prove to you by scriptures and what this
[1:14:07] one says and how this one is better than
[1:14:08] that one and how brother says this
[1:14:10] better than Billy Graham or how brother
[1:14:13] says this better than I got no time for
[1:14:15] that.
[1:14:17] What? Like what's preventing you from
[1:14:18] seeing that Christ is is God?
[1:14:25] What do you need? Christ himself said,
[1:14:27] "I've been here so long. You you do not
[1:14:29] know that I am the father. The father I
[1:14:32] am in the father, the father in me, and
[1:14:34] we are one. Have I been with you so long
[1:14:37] and you're still asking to see the
[1:14:38] father?"
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; What do you need to know?
[1:14:42] What do you need to satisfy that
[1:14:44] immature little puny childish brain of
[1:14:46] yours that requires logic and reasoning
[1:14:49] and proof and and all the links and
[1:14:52] sources you can get from the internet to
[1:14:53] prove that Christ is God?
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; This is not about seeing Jesus as God.
[1:15:01] This this is the belief that we have by
[1:15:04] faith.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; The mystery revealed in Christ. Okay.
[1:15:09] Are you are you with me? I'm going to
[1:15:12] say this once. If you're not going to
[1:15:14] get it now, you're never going to get it
[1:15:16] ever. Pack up and leave.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:15:21] What is the mystery of Christ?
[1:15:24] What is Jesus Christ?
[1:15:26] What does he mean by if you've seen me,
[1:15:28] you've seen the father?
[1:15:30] What does it mean to you personally?
[1:15:34] Only one thing. Jesus Christ is proof
[1:15:38] that man can be God.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; That's the most meaningful thing to you.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Everything else is Christian theology.
[1:15:53] &gt;&gt; What manner of man is this that the wind
[1:15:56] and the seas obey him?
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; What manner of man is this that he
[1:16:00] raised Lazarus from the dead? What
[1:16:02] manner of man is this that he could
[1:16:03] allow himself to be taken and scourged
[1:16:05] and put on the cross to die and then
[1:16:08] rise again? What manner of man is this
[1:16:10] to forgive sins?
[1:16:13] What manner of man is this to descent to
[1:16:15] hell and release one dimension and take
[1:16:17] them up into another?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; This is the revelation that man can be
[1:16:23] God.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; What is this all about? The story of God
[1:16:26] and man.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; That God could become man and man could
[1:16:30] become God. Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:33] manifestation that man can be God.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's the only meaningful thing to you.
[1:16:40] Nothing else.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; That's not going to be proven to you by
[1:16:44] words of William Brandham or words of
[1:16:46] Billy Graham or whichever other ham you
[1:16:49] can find. Right? There's not not any
[1:16:53] other person. If you didn't get this by
[1:16:56] the Bible and the message already,
[1:16:58] you've missed the point.
[1:17:01] Because that's what you're being
[1:17:02] connected to.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; You're being connected to knowing that
[1:17:07] one day you can be like Christ.
[1:17:11] &gt;&gt; And what are you saying then?
[1:17:15] See that man can be God.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; That's what almost all Christians miss.
[1:17:22] That's what the Jews accused Christ of.
[1:17:25] What do they say? You being a man,
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; make yourself God.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; That's the reason they crucified him.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Called him bilab said he was blaspheing.
[1:17:37] That was the entire purpose and the
[1:17:41] revelation of God in Christ is that man
[1:17:44] can be God. Man can declare the father.
[1:17:49] Man can manifest the fountain of life.
[1:17:53] Man can display the fountain of seven
[1:17:56] colors. Man can display the everlasting
[1:17:59] Elam. Man can display Elohim. Man can
[1:18:03] display Yahweh, Jehovah, the
[1:18:06] self-existing one.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; This is proof. Christ is proof that this
[1:18:10] is possible.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; And he came to tell you that you were
[1:18:16] that originally and sin came in by your
[1:18:20] own choice. But there's a way for you to
[1:18:23] get back there.
[1:18:25] That's Christianity.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; Not this nonsense we make today with
[1:18:31] churches and denominations and this name
[1:18:33] and that name and everyone's leading you
[1:18:36] someplace to to to where some man gave
[1:18:40] you an idea of what you are what you're
[1:18:43] going to be or what you have to do. And
[1:18:46] usually it amounts to paying an X amount
[1:18:48] of money to the church for the rest of
[1:18:50] your life
[1:18:52] with a promise of something because if
[1:18:54] you don't it's going to, you know, it's
[1:18:56] going to be detrimental to your place in
[1:19:00] heaven.
[1:19:04] That's what all men do.
[1:19:07] We know that story. It's it's recorded
[1:19:10] through history. Men are going to dupe
[1:19:13] you.
[1:19:14] Men are going to take away your free
[1:19:16] will.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; They're going to use religion and power
[1:19:19] and and uh and and fear and scare you
[1:19:24] about hell and demons and witchcraft and
[1:19:27] and and all kinds of terrifying things
[1:19:29] and why you need God and you need prayer
[1:19:32] and you need oil and you need holy water
[1:19:34] and you need saints and you need Mary
[1:19:37] and you need whole of people to go
[1:19:39] through or else you're dead meat.
[1:19:45] Yeah. What kind of God is that?
[1:19:49] One who walks around in eggshells in
[1:19:51] fear half his life.
[1:19:54] Crossing yourself, sprinkling,
[1:19:57] using liquids, all kinds of weird
[1:20:00] things, and blessed this and blessed
[1:20:02] cloth and blessed clothing and blessed
[1:20:05] stuff and blessed stick and blessed
[1:20:07] Bible and all of that.
[1:20:10] You're just a person still under the
[1:20:13] spirit of bondage. You haven't even seen
[1:20:16] father yet.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, if you seen
[1:20:20] father, you break out of your house with
[1:20:22] your chest standing out.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; You you you break out of this life
[1:20:28] saying what can separate me from the
[1:20:30] love of God?
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; No danger, peril, sword, no nothing, no
[1:20:35] disease, no death, no nothing can
[1:20:37] separate me. That's your experience when
[1:20:40] you are connected to him.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I want to show you.
[1:20:47] So, so what's our inheritance? Sunship,
[1:20:51] theophony, heavenly inheritance. Abraham
[1:20:54] was not linked to it yet because Messiah
[1:20:56] had not come. They all did such great
[1:20:59] things but they they did not receive it
[1:21:01] because Messiah had not yet come because
[1:21:03] father had not been revealed to them
[1:21:05] yet.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Right? Now sunship has been made known.
[1:21:10] Theophony is in sight. Right now all
[1:21:13] those from Abraham's day all the way up
[1:21:15] to Christ, they died and went into the
[1:21:17] fifth dimension, Abraham's bosom. They
[1:21:19] were not yet sixth dimension. They did
[1:21:21] not attain heavenly status. Only after
[1:21:25] Christ was the way paved to sunship
[1:21:28] to attain theophony.
[1:21:31] Now what is a son?
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; How many of you think you know what a
[1:21:36] sun is?
[1:21:38] H a son is not somebody who just plays
[1:21:41] before the father. A son is not somebody
[1:21:45] who uh has to be given something and the
[1:21:47] father must pet him on the head and tell
[1:21:49] him good boy, good boy. Well done.
[1:21:52] That's a dog.
[1:21:56] That's not a son.
[1:21:58] This is a son.
[1:22:00] God who had sun at times in diverse
[1:22:02] manners spake in times past by the
[1:22:04] fathers by the prophets
[1:22:07] hath in these last days spoken unto us
[1:22:11] by his son. First point who is a son who
[1:22:16] the father can speak through.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; What are we doing now? I'm defining what
[1:22:21] sunship is.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm defining to you what a son is.
[1:22:25] Who is a son? One who God can speak by.
[1:22:29] who when he speaks it's God speaking.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; I am he.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Right. First point number two. Whom he
[1:22:39] hath appointed heir of all things. A son
[1:22:43] is the inheritor of everything that is
[1:22:45] the fathers.
[1:22:47] He owns heavens and earth. It's his time
[1:22:51] dimensions. All belongs to him. He
[1:22:54] inherits all things.
[1:22:56] Number three, who being the brightness
[1:22:59] of his glory and the express image of
[1:23:01] his person.
[1:23:04] This is that theophony,
[1:23:06] the brightness of his glory, right? He
[1:23:10] in verse three it says he was the
[1:23:12] enlightening. What is the brightness of
[1:23:14] his glory? The revelation of who he is.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; A son is the revelation of who God is.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; A son is a revelation of who the father
[1:23:23] is. He's the enlightening brightness
[1:23:26] enlightening.
[1:23:28] He removes the darkness. That means
[1:23:31] Christians who claim to be sons of God
[1:23:33] must be people manifesting the father,
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; the nature of the father.
[1:23:39] People who claim to be sons of God must
[1:23:41] walk in truth. They must speak light.
[1:23:44] They must not cause confusion.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; They cannot speak with a double tongue.
[1:23:51] Right?
[1:23:53] uh and upholding all things by the power
[1:23:56] of his by the word of his power.
[1:23:59] Upholding is overcoming.
[1:24:01] Overcoming by what? Spoken word.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; That's a son. He overcomes the
[1:24:08] challenges of this life by spoken word.
[1:24:13] And not just spoken word that he heard
[1:24:17] by the word of his power.
[1:24:21] Amen. He was able to. So this is what
[1:24:24] Christ did. He expressed who the father
[1:24:26] is. He was the brightness of his glory.
[1:24:28] He was the revelation of the father. He
[1:24:30] was he spoke. When he spoke, it was God
[1:24:33] speaking. He was the inheritor of all
[1:24:36] things. This answers the question why
[1:24:38] the wind and the seas obey him. Why
[1:24:40] death could not overcome him? Why he
[1:24:42] could raise Lazarus from the from the
[1:24:44] from the dead? It answers all the
[1:24:47] questions, right? when he had by himself
[1:24:50] purged our sins, which means he's an
[1:24:53] intercessor for others,
[1:24:56] sat down on the right hand of the
[1:24:57] majesty on high. Sat down on the right
[1:25:00] hand of the majesty. That means a son is
[1:25:03] equal to his father.
[1:25:07] Sat down on the right hand means he
[1:25:10] handles his father's business.
[1:25:15] Amen.
[1:25:17] I love the rest of it. The rest of it is
[1:25:19] just phenomenal because it brings us
[1:25:21] back to our story of God and man, which
[1:25:24] is
[1:25:26] being made so much better than the
[1:25:28] angels.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Who was made better than the angels? Not
[1:25:32] the body of Jesus Christ born of a
[1:25:34] virgin. King Theophony. Theophony is
[1:25:38] better than the angels,
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; right? And by and as he has by
[1:25:43] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[1:25:46] name
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; than they
[1:25:50] that's telling you theophony is a more
[1:25:52] excellent name than angels.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Theophony is a more excellent existence
[1:25:59] than angels.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Right? Verse 5 tells you that angels are
[1:26:05] not sons. For unto which of the angels
[1:26:07] said he at any time thou art my son?
[1:26:13] Angels are not sons.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; They are angels.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Sons are sons. The scriptures is saying
[1:26:19] it's implying that not one of the angels
[1:26:22] did he speak to and say thou art my son.
[1:26:25] That's what Lucifer desired. Lucifer
[1:26:28] desired sunship.
[1:26:32] It was a worthy desire. He was just not
[1:26:35] made for it. He was not born for it.
[1:26:41] Again, I will be to him a father and he
[1:26:44] shall be to me a son. Saints, that is
[1:26:46] what sunship is. That is what your
[1:26:49] inheritance is. You know, you can't be
[1:26:52] shy about this.
[1:26:54] So, what is sunship? From Hebrews 1:1-5,
[1:26:58] one who God can speak by. Number two,
[1:27:00] he's appointed heir of all things.
[1:27:03] Number three, he is the mystery of God
[1:27:06] revealed the brightness of his glory,
[1:27:09] the express image of his person. Number
[1:27:12] four, he overcomes all things by faith
[1:27:14] in the spoken word, upholding all things
[1:27:17] by the word of his power.
[1:27:20] Number five, adopted to take the place
[1:27:23] of God, sitting on the right hand of
[1:27:25] God. Adoption to take the place. So
[1:27:29] after he had overcome, he uh ascended
[1:27:32] and was adopted. That's full adoption
[1:27:34] taking the place of God.
[1:27:38] Number six, King Theophony. He exists
[1:27:42] higher than sixth dimension. He has got
[1:27:45] a name greater than the angels.
[1:27:48] Number seven, he overcame in flesh on
[1:27:51] earth and inherited all things. Praise
[1:27:54] be to God. So saints, we have not yet
[1:27:58] the bodies. That's what we read in
[1:28:00] MelkiseDC. We'll read again. And then
[1:28:02] you see him come right down uh the
[1:28:05] regular line from attribute before the
[1:28:06] foundation of the world his name is put
[1:28:08] in the lamb's book of life. Then from
[1:28:10] that he become the word the theophony
[1:28:12] that could appear disappear and then he
[1:28:14] become flesh and returned back again
[1:28:16] resurrected that same body in a
[1:28:18] glorified condition.
[1:28:20] But you bypass the theophony and become
[1:28:22] flesh man to be tempted by sin. And then
[1:28:26] if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved
[1:28:29] we have one already waiting. What?
[1:28:31] theophony.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; We have not yet the bodies. So we have
[1:28:37] not been fully connected or fully joined
[1:28:42] or fully married
[1:28:45] to the bodies.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; We have obtained a spirit of adoption
[1:28:50] whereby we cry abba.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Right? But that theophony knows abba.
[1:28:55] Yeah,
[1:28:56] &gt;&gt; we are coming to that understanding that
[1:28:58] theophony has right now. You are an
[1:29:02] orphan receiving the promise of full
[1:29:04] adoption through the earnest.
[1:29:08] The Holy Ghost gives you the promise of
[1:29:11] adoption, the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:29:14] you who are born of your parents in the
[1:29:17] darkness of this world can cry aba. That
[1:29:21] means you can deny your birth where you
[1:29:25] can remember in the beginning I told you
[1:29:26] it's illogical.
[1:29:28] It's unreasonable. There's no logical
[1:29:31] reason why you had no father. If if we
[1:29:35] take away the message of the hour today
[1:29:38] from off the face of the earth, if we
[1:29:40] take away Christianity, do you know what
[1:29:41] happens to this world?
[1:29:44] It's dead in a few seconds.
[1:29:50] Only the morality of God's word is
[1:29:52] holding this this world alive.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; There there isn't a single religion or
[1:30:00] philosophy that has the power to keep
[1:30:03] all those nukes in the ground.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; Not one. Not even Buddhism.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; Nobody is using Buddhism to break to
[1:30:14] broke a peace in the in the in the
[1:30:15] world.
[1:30:16] Nobody's using Buddhism to broke a peace
[1:30:20] between Ukraine and Russia
[1:30:22] or Israel and Palestine.
[1:30:24] Nobody. Nobody ever says you're a
[1:30:27] Buddhist. You're supposed to do this.
[1:30:30] All of them say you're a Christian.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to do this. You They
[1:30:36] hold you accountable to Christianity.
[1:30:38] Nobody goes around saying you're a
[1:30:40] Muslim, you're supposed to do this.
[1:30:42] You're a Hindu, you're supposed to do
[1:30:43] this. Nobody cares about that. Nobody
[1:30:46] holds any other religion accountable
[1:30:48] except Christianity. Why? Because that
[1:30:50] is the one that speaks of the morals
[1:30:52] that hold society safe.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; You Africans on this continent, you'd be
[1:30:59] going back to tribalism and killing each
[1:31:02] other for speaking a different language
[1:31:04] in 5 seconds.
[1:31:08] This is the truth. We did it in India.
[1:31:12] In India, this is what happened. We had
[1:31:14] the high cost and low cost and we abused
[1:31:17] they they abused the low cost. It's been
[1:31:21] for thousands of years.
[1:31:24] If you're a certain uh uh surname,
[1:31:27] you're a low cost. You can only be a
[1:31:29] servant. You can never rise from servant
[1:31:32] status to anything.
[1:31:35] If you are from the raja, well, you're a
[1:31:37] Brahman. If you're from that status,
[1:31:40] that's what you're lucky. You're born
[1:31:42] into that. You can be an absolutely
[1:31:43] filthy horror drug dealer and still
[1:31:46] you'll be greater than all the peasants
[1:31:48] in India.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; You can never rise to anything. So what
[1:31:51] do those Indians do? They leave India
[1:31:52] and go to the west where they can become
[1:31:54] something.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; They come to Africa where they can
[1:31:57] become something because in India they
[1:31:59] can never rise above the status.
[1:32:02] So do you here in Africa, you have to go
[1:32:04] to where Christian principles are taught
[1:32:06] to escape your tribal order, where you
[1:32:09] can rise from what your fathers holding
[1:32:12] you down here in Africa and you can go
[1:32:14] to American Canada and become something.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; You cannot do that in any other religion
[1:32:19] you come from
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; or culture or race. Without
[1:32:23] Christianity, you'd be killing each
[1:32:25] other all over again.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; That is the truth.
[1:32:32] I know where I come from. I know my
[1:32:34] ancestry. I know the religions where my
[1:32:36] families came from. I know what they
[1:32:38] teach. My religion, my ancestry is the
[1:32:42] most racist ancestry in the world. I
[1:32:45] laugh at all these Americans, you know,
[1:32:47] who who uh put Indians into their
[1:32:50] parliament, their their Senate. And
[1:32:53] those Indians, I hear them on the news,
[1:32:54] you know, they're all talking about
[1:32:56] equality. Indians are the most racist
[1:32:58] people on earth. They hate blacks and
[1:33:00] whites equally.
[1:33:05] All those Indians laughing, they know
[1:33:06] what I'm talking about. We got special
[1:33:08] names for every one of you who are not
[1:33:11] our race. Bad names.
[1:33:14] So I hear these fellas all the they're
[1:33:16] they're running for Congress. They're
[1:33:18] Indians.
[1:33:20] And those on the Democratic side, they
[1:33:22] talk about equality.
[1:33:24] They're all liars. They hate every other
[1:33:26] race. They see every other race as
[1:33:28] beneath them.
[1:33:30] It's part of our Indian culture.
[1:33:34] Yeah.
[1:33:36] Black people smell bad. White people
[1:33:39] smell bad.
[1:33:44] They know. They all know. All of them
[1:33:46] laughing. They know because that's what
[1:33:48] you're taught.
[1:33:50] They're full of nonsense. Is why people
[1:33:53] don't have a bath
[1:33:55] regularly. We bought three times a day.
[1:34:01] The most racist people. So don't tell me
[1:34:05] you are going to save the world with
[1:34:07] your culture.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; If you can't even see what removes that
[1:34:12] from us is only the word of God.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; For me to put my arms around my
[1:34:17] brothers, black and white, Chinese,
[1:34:19] whatever, and say to you are my brother.
[1:34:22] We are one. Only one thing can do that
[1:34:24] and that's the Holy Spirit.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; Nothing else because it's bred into you
[1:34:29] to hate everyone else.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; And don't tell me it's a religion of
[1:34:33] peace. It's a culture of peace. It
[1:34:35] isn't. It's a lie. They executed Mahatma
[1:34:38] Gandhi. They executed every other
[1:34:40] leader. They did all that. And you here
[1:34:42] in Africa are no different.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; Muslims are no different.
[1:34:49] Yeah. Muhammad dies and uh comes up with
[1:34:52] this idea there must be a khalif. You
[1:34:54] don't know about the caliphate. There
[1:34:56] must be a khalif. So the first khalif
[1:34:58] they get is from Egypt. But now the
[1:34:59] Saudi Arabians are unhappy with an
[1:35:01] Egyptian calip. The Iranians are unhappy
[1:35:03] with an Egyptian calip. The Turkish.
[1:35:06] Right now the Muslims will never elect a
[1:35:08] califf in the place of Muhammad because
[1:35:11] the moment he's from Saudi Arabia, the
[1:35:13] Arab the Iranians will bomb them.
[1:35:18] And God forbid they they elect a
[1:35:21] Palestinian califf.
[1:35:25] They're all fighting for each other
[1:35:26] because they're against Israel and
[1:35:28] they're against Christians. But where
[1:35:30] must they get a califf from? It's like
[1:35:31] here in South Africa. Will the Sutu
[1:35:34] people accept a Zulu king over South
[1:35:36] Africa? Never. Will the Zulu people
[1:35:39] accept a petty king over South Africa?
[1:35:42] Never.
[1:35:44] They'll die first.
[1:35:47] Probably the most peaceful and loving uh
[1:35:51] Africans on earth are the Zimbabweans
[1:35:55] and they too will turn savage.
[1:35:58] They are the most peaceful. Our
[1:36:00] friendliest people on the planet are
[1:36:01] Zimbabweans. I've traveled I can tell
[1:36:04] you to the most loving people and
[1:36:06] they'll turn savage
[1:36:09] because if you put an guy as king over
[1:36:11] all of Zimbabwe,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; you have trouble my friend.
[1:36:16] They'll turn from those hospitable,
[1:36:18] loving people into absolute savages.
[1:36:21] Their fangs will come out.
[1:36:27] This is why you have not yet the bodies.
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; You see, I'm the only one who will tell
[1:36:32] you the truth. [laughter]
[1:36:36] Everyone else is afraid to say it, but
[1:36:38] you know what I'm talking about.
[1:36:41] What we are lacking then there are
[1:36:44] heavenly theophony bodies. Becoming sons
[1:36:48] is about this body. It's about the
[1:36:50] spirit and the soul in this earthly form
[1:36:53] overcoming sin and death by believing in
[1:36:56] the spoken word with pure faith unto
[1:36:58] full salvation and redemption. Then
[1:37:00] we're we're not be we will not be able
[1:37:02] to inherit theophanies unless our
[1:37:05] natures here match the character of
[1:37:08] theophony. For there to be a marriage,
[1:37:11] for there to be oneness, this flesh has
[1:37:14] to receive the character that matches
[1:37:16] the theophony. So you have to become
[1:37:19] sons in this body by spoken word by
[1:37:24] overcoming
[1:37:26] by spoken word
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; and then the two become one and then
[1:37:30] you've inherited heaven. Amen. And then
[1:37:34] heaven gives you the right to inherit
[1:37:36] eternal earth. Glory to God. So my part
[1:37:39] in the inheritance a little further now
[1:37:42] that 11 ver uh 11th verse in whom also
[1:37:45] we have obtained an inheritance
[1:37:48] uh or an inheritance. Somebody has to
[1:37:50] leave you something to inherit it.
[1:37:52] Right? Is that right? An inheritance.
[1:37:55] What inheritance do we have? What
[1:37:56] inheritance did I have? I didn't have
[1:37:58] any. But God left me an inheritance when
[1:38:00] he put my name in the lamb's book of
[1:38:02] life before the foundation of the world.
[1:38:04] So I didn't have any. He had to the name
[1:38:07] was an attribute that was that came from
[1:38:09] the fountain of life and found a body
[1:38:11] and predestinated this body to that
[1:38:14] inheritance.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; Adoption has always been about
[1:38:19] inheritance.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. He left me an
[1:38:22] inheritance when he wrote the mystery,
[1:38:25] the name, the mystery of my true
[1:38:28] character in the lamb's book of life.
[1:38:30] That attribute found me. That attribute
[1:38:33] has the ability in it to bring me to the
[1:38:36] character of that theophony.
[1:38:39] Glory to God. This shows the need for
[1:38:41] the book coming down, right? For being
[1:38:43] revealed. It contains the revelation. So
[1:38:46] when the book is open, I see my name in
[1:38:48] there. What do I It's personal sense. I
[1:38:52] see what I'm supposed to be in Christ,
[1:38:54] right? It reveals the revelation whether
[1:38:57] I'm a part of that inheritance or not.
[1:39:00] Of believing the word of salvation and
[1:39:03] receiving power to become sons is only
[1:39:06] faith toward becoming sons.
[1:39:09] But receiving the open book is receiving
[1:39:12] the proof of my sunship.
[1:39:15] Right? The title lead of redemption the
[1:39:18] beginning of my adoption. This is the
[1:39:20] day of full adoption.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:23] When I received the new birth, I
[1:39:25] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:39:28] I cry aba. I received the baptism of the
[1:39:30] holy ghost which is the earnest of my
[1:39:32] adoption.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Right? It is receiving the spirit of
[1:39:36] sunship. But receiving the open book is
[1:39:39] the proof of my sunship.
[1:39:42] The title deed, this is the name I and
[1:39:47] only I, you and only you can hear
[1:39:51] concerning me and you under the ministry
[1:39:55] of the seven thunders.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; That's the beautiful part of this last
[1:39:59] time. If you remember 1 Peter 1 2:7
[1:40:02] where we spoke about, remember we read
[1:40:04] it last week, there's inheritance,
[1:40:06] incorruptible, undefiled, reserved in
[1:40:08] the heaven for you. Remember that,
[1:40:10] right? The scriptures say we are
[1:40:12] begotten again, born again for this
[1:40:14] purpose, receiving an incorruptible
[1:40:17] inheritance, undefiled, meant having no
[1:40:19] age, only to be revealed in the last
[1:40:22] days. That itself shows us the
[1:40:24] revelation of what the last days is
[1:40:25] about. That this would that the
[1:40:27] preaching of the word what it should
[1:40:29] achieve in the last days. And then it
[1:40:31] says who are kept
[1:40:34] showing that it's a person.
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; It's a body. Amen.
[1:40:39] All right. So, let's close this down.
[1:40:44] Who's this MelkiseDC? Then after you
[1:40:48] recognize the very word of God was eagle
[1:40:51] food, then you left
[1:40:58] eagle food. Eagle food is speaking of
[1:41:02] food that pertains to sons.
[1:41:06] You understand? Don't don't pass over
[1:41:09] that without grabbing the the value, the
[1:41:12] nugget
[1:41:15] after you recognize the very word of God
[1:41:18] was eagle food. What's he referring to
[1:41:21] eagle food? He's referring to that story
[1:41:24] he told you about the the eagle in the
[1:41:26] barnyard
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; who was lost in a place where he didn't
[1:41:29] know who he was. He was an orphan. His
[1:41:33] mother was a chicken
[1:41:35] and he's he's got his big wings and this
[1:41:37] ability and he's flopping around in a
[1:41:39] chicken yard and he doesn't know he's an
[1:41:42] eagle. And then one day he hears a
[1:41:44] scream of an eagle and something inside
[1:41:48] opens
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; and he looks up and he sees something
[1:41:52] there that looks like him.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; That's what it means. When you recognize
[1:41:57] the very word of God was eagle food. It
[1:42:00] has to do with identity. Yeah,
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; it has to do with sunship.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Then you left the other thing.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; Then you left the other thing. You have
[1:42:10] been formed into the living image of the
[1:42:13] living God. You heard from your
[1:42:15] theophony.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; That is from your theophony. The eagle
[1:42:20] scream, the eagle food. See, then you
[1:42:23] heard. Then he says, if this earthly
[1:42:25] body be dissolved, we have one waiting.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? If you are starting to
[1:42:30] manifest the word, you are expressing
[1:42:32] the image of his person as Christ did.
[1:42:34] Hebrews chapter 1, you become sons. Once
[1:42:38] you have grabbed onto this, you know
[1:42:40] what you are learning right now and some
[1:42:43] of us very slowly.
[1:42:46] You have to speak for God.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; You have to be the brightness of his
[1:42:50] person,
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; the image of his person.
[1:42:53] And uh it's it's going to get very bad
[1:42:56] before it gets to where it's supposed to
[1:42:58] be
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; because this flesh, let's not downplay
[1:43:03] how stubborn this flesh is,
[1:43:07] right? This is the reason why it's
[1:43:08] taking this long because it is so set in
[1:43:14] its ways, so stubborn.
[1:43:18] So uh the the this this first nature is
[1:43:22] to sin.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Right. So this first nature is to rebel
[1:43:29] against the word.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; So this is the reason it's taking so
[1:43:32] long because to accept sunship and
[1:43:36] inheritance of God is a fight.
[1:43:41] So it means that you have been appointed
[1:43:44] heir of all things as Christ was. You
[1:43:46] have obtained a better name than the
[1:43:48] angels. Do you believe that? That's what
[1:43:51] is revealed to you when the book is
[1:43:52] revealed. When the seventh seal is open
[1:43:54] and you see your name there, you see
[1:43:56] that you have a better name than the
[1:43:58] angels.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; I could spend days speaking just about
[1:44:02] that. Hearing from your theophony is
[1:44:04] hearing that better name than the
[1:44:06] angels. It is hearing your name like in
[1:44:09] the type when Christ called Mary
[1:44:11] Magdalene's name at the tomb and she
[1:44:14] instantly knew who he was.
[1:44:17] To us, it is the recognition of our new
[1:44:20] character. Okay, let's go to the
[1:44:22] invisible union. I love this quote.
[1:44:25] Your name of your first nature was born
[1:44:28] and put in a book of life. All your
[1:44:30] deeds, your first nature was this one.
[1:44:33] All your deeds was wrote then to
[1:44:35] everything you done under the nature was
[1:44:37] in a book called the book of life. Now
[1:44:39] you you were separated from the womb uh
[1:44:43] you separated from that union by
[1:44:45] spiritual death that is accepting Christ
[1:44:48] as your personal savior. So the first
[1:44:50] nature this character that I was born
[1:44:54] with the sinful character by accepting
[1:44:57] Christ I'm separated. I died to myself.
[1:45:01] I'm separated from that original nature,
[1:45:03] but it's still there, right? I'm I'm I'm
[1:45:06] battling it out. Your natural desire is
[1:45:09] to cut your hair. Your natural desire is
[1:45:10] to wear shorts, paint your face. See
[1:45:12] what I'm saying? Your natural desire is
[1:45:14] to be intellectual, smart man, know
[1:45:17] something better than the other. That's
[1:45:18] what Eve wanted. That's the very thing
[1:45:20] she wanted. Well, you separated from
[1:45:22] your first union by spiritual death. Now
[1:45:25] you are born again or remarried again to
[1:45:28] the new spirit. So in other words,
[1:45:30] that's when the attribute becomes
[1:45:32] meaningful. The attribute that was in
[1:45:34] the fountain of life becomes alive. Now
[1:45:37] you are you got these two natures in
[1:45:39] you. The other one which was not
[1:45:42] revealed to you, you was still in
[1:45:43] darkness. Now it's become light. Now you
[1:45:48] you're battling with these two inside
[1:45:50] you. Right? Well, one says you're a son
[1:45:53] of God. The other one says, "Oh, come
[1:45:54] on, man. Have some fun."
[1:45:57] Right? Now you are born again, remarried
[1:46:00] again. Not your natural life or things
[1:46:02] of the world, but of eternal life. That
[1:46:03] germ that was in you at the beginning
[1:46:05] found you.
[1:46:10] Now your old book is gone with your old
[1:46:12] union. Now your name in your old has
[1:46:16] been transferred. Now you say, "Do you
[1:46:17] mean to tell me that my old book God put
[1:46:19] in a se of his forgetfulness, you stand
[1:46:21] perfectly before God?"
[1:46:24] the in um paragraph 24.
[1:46:27] Now your name is now in the new book,
[1:46:30] not the book of life, but the lamb's
[1:46:32] book of life. What the lamb redeemed.
[1:46:36] This is what sunship is about, right?
[1:46:38] Bringing more sons like unto himself.
[1:46:40] Not the old book of your natural union,
[1:46:42] but your new bride. Hallelujah. Your new
[1:46:46] life is in the lamb's book of life. Your
[1:46:48] marriage certificate. Hallelujah. Where
[1:46:50] your true eternal germ from the
[1:46:52] beginning takes hold.
[1:46:54] In the last two services we showed you
[1:46:56] this what that germ is how it comes to
[1:46:59] life. Do you agree? Do you believe it?
[1:47:02] All this looks like to me it's almost
[1:47:04] become like like message buzzwords now
[1:47:08] your marriage certificate your lamb's
[1:47:09] book of life your eternal germ that that
[1:47:12] germ found you and all that. It's like
[1:47:14] they preach it so much as buzzwords
[1:47:16] people don't understand the reality of
[1:47:18] it anymore.
[1:47:20] Right
[1:47:22] now you're only forgiven but you're
[1:47:24] justified. Glory justified. Romans 5:1
[1:47:28] said therefore being justified by faith.
[1:47:30] So that is the new name that we hear
[1:47:33] under the thunders. That's why the
[1:47:35] message is different because when the
[1:47:38] message is revealed to you, it reveals
[1:47:39] to you way beyond what Christianity
[1:47:43] gives.
[1:47:45] Because Christianity only introduces you
[1:47:47] to father. The message
[1:47:50] hooks you into inheritance.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; If you
[1:47:56] uh received every messenger in the
[1:47:59] church ages, it hooked you into
[1:48:01] inheritance.
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; It put you into sunship. The other one
[1:48:05] was just recognizing father. So all
[1:48:08] Christians in the world just recognize
[1:48:10] father and don't take the road to to
[1:48:13] adoption.
[1:48:16] you know, I I listen to some of them.
[1:48:19] I like to listen to them
[1:48:22] uh because I like to hear whether
[1:48:25] there's progression. And uh I hear them,
[1:48:29] the denominational preachers, and
[1:48:31] they're they're like, you know, uh we
[1:48:33] are all sinners. I'm a sinner. You're a
[1:48:36] sinner. We're all sinners.
[1:48:39] You know, every one of us is not
[1:48:41] perfect. Every one of And it sounds it
[1:48:43] sounds good. It sounds like we're making
[1:48:45] everyone the same. It sounds like we're
[1:48:48] making uh we're being inclusive. There's
[1:48:51] that word,
[1:48:53] right? Everyone, we're inclusive.
[1:48:55] Everyone's everyone's dirty.
[1:48:59] That makes us all bad and all of us need
[1:49:02] Jesus. But that's a saying, you know, we
[1:49:05] recognize Jesus and we recognize father,
[1:49:07] but we're all stuck here. So every day
[1:49:10] we basically come to church just to keep
[1:49:12] repenting. We just we need church and
[1:49:15] worship and we need the word just so we
[1:49:17] can keep repenting.
[1:49:20] But we like we don't want to become
[1:49:22] sons.
[1:49:24] We don't want to take over the
[1:49:25] inheritance.
[1:49:27] We we're too afraid of the
[1:49:28] responsibility.
[1:49:30] We don't want to speak for him. We don't
[1:49:33] want to manifest him. We just want what
[1:49:35] he has to give us for now. We want
[1:49:38] gifts.
[1:49:41] How was your sunship given to you? By
[1:49:44] predestination.
[1:49:47] How is it? How was our inheritance given
[1:49:49] to us? Through what? Predestination.
[1:49:51] Predestination is fornowledge. That how
[1:49:55] did God know he could trust you to be a
[1:49:57] preacher? His fornowledge. Not he that
[1:50:00] willth or runth. It's God that showeth
[1:50:02] mercy. That's right. Predestination. He
[1:50:04] knew what was in you. He know what was
[1:50:06] in you before you come to the earth.
[1:50:08] There's our story of God and man. He
[1:50:10] know what was in you before there was
[1:50:12] ever a earth for you to come on.
[1:50:16] That's him. That's the infinite God. The
[1:50:20] infinite. We're finite. We can only
[1:50:22] think finite saints. Predestination
[1:50:26] by fornowledge. We're closing. Sunship
[1:50:30] was given to us to the elect by
[1:50:32] predestination. That was his plan for
[1:50:34] you. that you that had to be revealed to
[1:50:36] you. You have no way of working that out
[1:50:38] yourself. Do you agree?
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Right. God could see by fornowledge what
[1:50:42] character you were supposed to have. You
[1:50:44] would never have known. You don't even
[1:50:46] know what what to do tomorrow.
[1:50:49] So he he predestinated you for a purpose
[1:50:53] and led you while you were not aware
[1:50:56] that he was leading you to an earth an
[1:50:58] earthly uh inheritance that could lead
[1:51:01] us to that sunship and make sure that we
[1:51:03] actually get it. Are you with us? By
[1:51:07] fornowledge, he could make the prophet a
[1:51:11] preacher
[1:51:13] or you a teacher or a mechanic or uh
[1:51:18] like a uh a carpenter or something or
[1:51:21] the other. He could make you into
[1:51:23] something, right? They were all uh uh by
[1:51:27] fornowledge he could make you into
[1:51:29] something. He could put into you an
[1:51:30] attribute that could lead you to become
[1:51:32] something you would never have thought
[1:51:35] could even lead you to a place where
[1:51:37] there is an earthly vocation for you
[1:51:40] like an like an earthly
[1:51:42] uh career or an earthly uh position in
[1:51:46] life that would be suitable to the
[1:51:49] purpose of a son of God.
[1:51:54] Is that right? You know because of that
[1:51:56] attribute within you, you're not going
[1:51:58] to choose something to be in this life
[1:52:01] that will contradict sunship.
[1:52:06] This is why there's such a a pressure on
[1:52:09] us as as people to not become something
[1:52:13] that will contradict God's word. Amen.
[1:52:17] And Abraham was looking for a city whose
[1:52:20] builder and maker was God according to
[1:52:21] Hebrews 11. Is that right? And they were
[1:52:25] all looking for something earthy because
[1:52:28] there was some earthly reward. And yet
[1:52:31] they all realized though they had
[1:52:33] attained Abraham received Isaac but was
[1:52:36] not satisfied.
[1:52:38] He received that promise but he realized
[1:52:39] there was something heavenly.
[1:52:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; David uh received the throne and then
[1:52:45] said but I want to build you a house.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; There's something more. Solomon did it
[1:52:51] and then there's something more and
[1:52:54] every time they had achieved their
[1:52:56] purpose on earth they degenerated into
[1:53:00] something and lost their testimonies
[1:53:02] became something else and got into
[1:53:05] idolatry and there was something more
[1:53:07] they were looking to and did not attain.
[1:53:10] Our inheritance in heaven is our
[1:53:12] theophanes and that gives us our
[1:53:14] sunship.
[1:53:16] Sunship is our heavenly relationship to
[1:53:18] God and the father is
[1:53:22] ah as his sons that entitles us to our
[1:53:26] earthly inheritance.
[1:53:28] Amen. So putting it plainly, your
[1:53:31] earthly inheritance one day is a
[1:53:34] glorified body,
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; a body that will live on earth for
[1:53:38] eternity.
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; But you cannot get that without becoming
[1:53:43] sun first. Amen.
[1:53:45] &gt;&gt; You cannot get that without receiving
[1:53:48] adoption because you can only take over
[1:53:51] the earthly inheritance if you have the
[1:53:53] title deed.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; To get the title deed, you have to
[1:53:56] become a son. To become a son, you need
[1:54:00] the spirit of adoption. You need spoken
[1:54:03] word. You need to overcome this by
[1:54:06] spoken word. Then you receive adoption.
[1:54:09] That's receiving full sunship. That's
[1:54:12] receiving earthly inheritance.
[1:54:14] That's the road to adoption.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; That's what that's why we are here. Look
[1:54:20] at where we are in that plan. Christ
[1:54:22] came 2,000 years ago. The baptism of the
[1:54:25] Holy Ghost came 2,000 years ago. Where
[1:54:27] are we right now?
[1:54:30] We are so far ahead, so far along. We
[1:54:33] are right here at the end where adoption
[1:54:36] is at the brink.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; We are at the time where the rapture is
[1:54:41] promised. We are at the time where
[1:54:43] theophanes have to be revealed to each
[1:54:45] son of God. Where all those that were
[1:54:47] dead shall be changed and those that are
[1:54:49] living shall be changed. For what
[1:54:51] purpose? Once we have all fully received
[1:54:53] sunship, it is time to take the earthly
[1:54:56] inheritance.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; And then what happens when we receive
[1:55:01] sunship while we're at the marriage
[1:55:03] supper? Our earthly inheritance is taken
[1:55:06] away from the enemy who has been
[1:55:09] squatting on it for a long time.
[1:55:11] and it is purged for our purpose.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in closing, rejoice and be
[1:55:22] exceeding glad.
[1:55:24] That is rapture. [clears throat] For
[1:55:26] what reason? For great is your reward in
[1:55:29] heaven. For so persecuted they the
[1:55:32] prophets which were before you. Great is
[1:55:35] your reward in heaven. This is more than
[1:55:37] just a fantasy. It's more than just a
[1:55:40] story of one day I'll make it to heaven
[1:55:41] because I accepted Christ. Your reward
[1:55:44] in heaven, your adoption, your sunship,
[1:55:49] who you are, your name revealed, the
[1:55:52] right to life, the right to the earth.
[1:55:56] Great is your reward in heaven. Rejoice
[1:55:58] and be exceeding glad. This is the time
[1:56:00] for rapture. Amen.
[1:56:03] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads
[1:56:04] together.
