[0:00] So as we close, what is the purpose of
[0:02] your day?
[0:06] And I went unto the angel and said unto
[0:08] him, give me the little book. And he
[0:09] said unto me, take it.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; And eat it up.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter. So
[0:16] you have, if you didn't know about
[0:18] something you have to do, here it is.
[0:20] Take it and eat it up.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; There's a purpose for you.
[0:24] &gt;&gt; And it shall make thy belly bitter, but
[0:26] it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[0:28] And I took the little book out of the
[0:30] angel's hand and ate it up, and it was
[0:32] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[0:34] as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[0:35] We all know that. And verse 11 says,
[0:37] "And he said unto me, thou must prophesy
[0:40] again before many peoples and nations
[0:43] and tongues and kings."
[0:45] &gt;&gt; And this is where you got people saying,
[0:47] you see, we must prophesy. You must
[0:50] speak with tongues. No, you must
[0:51] prophesy to many tongues.
[0:53] &gt;&gt; That means many languages of the earth.
[0:55] You must you must prophesy. You must
[0:58] speak
[1:00] &gt;&gt; to the world.
[1:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02] &gt;&gt; There's your purpose for today. So
[1:06] what's the purpose? Take the book.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; Speak the word.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; This has never been given to any other
[1:14] age before.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; This is the purpose of the bride today.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; Take the book. Speak the word. There it
[1:23] is. So what is your purpose, young
[1:25] people? speaking the word,
[1:29] &gt;&gt; taking the word.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; Now, this is what I find frustrating
[1:34] today
[1:36] is that people who are taking the word
[1:39] don't seem to be speaking.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; Either you feel pressurized that you're
[1:45] not allowed to speak, and I'm not just I
[1:47] don't just mean speaking as in with your
[1:50] mouth. Of course, you need to. It's
[1:53] telling you that the word that you took
[1:56] needs to be manifested
[1:58] &gt;&gt; to all kingdoms and nations and tribes
[2:00] and people,
[2:03] &gt;&gt; to your neighbor in the street,
[2:05] &gt;&gt; to the people you come in contact with.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; I feel like
[2:11] it needs to change. That's why we
[2:14] feeling like something is missing.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; There needs to be a shift.
[2:18] &gt;&gt; It needs to change. You got Pentecostal
[2:21] people, uh, denominational people, they
[2:24] they'll meet you somewhere and they'll
[2:26] they'll come up to you and say, "Have
[2:28] you been saved? Have you been born
[2:30] again?" And and you're thinking like,
[2:32] "If only you know." And then you walk
[2:35] away.
[2:37] &gt;&gt; What happened to your voice?
[2:40] &gt;&gt; What happened to your testimony?
[2:42] &gt;&gt; What happened to the witnesses?
[2:44] &gt;&gt; How are we going to fill Revelations
[2:46] 10:8-11?
[2:48] Number one, you can't do it unless you
[2:50] take the book.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; And you need the Holy Spirit to be able
[2:54] to take the book. The Holy Spirit is the
[2:56] one saying, "Take the book, eat it up."
[2:58] This is what's going to happen. You take
[3:00] that word in and then you have to speak
[3:02] it.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; You know, when I was uh a young man and
[3:07] running away from the ministry, a very
[3:10] humble minister who brought correction
[3:12] to me told me something. He said, "If
[3:15] you take the book and eat the book and
[3:17] you have this word inside you and you
[3:19] are not
[3:21] &gt;&gt; speaking it, it's going to corrupt you.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; You're going to be like a well that's
[3:26] it's got no
[3:27] &gt;&gt; expression. It's got it's not it's not
[3:30] releasing itself." And you and I
[3:32] understood what was happening because
[3:33] there I was sitting in the in the church
[3:36] listening to ministry and I'm and I'm
[3:38] sitting there and I can feel the
[3:39] thoughts of God coming in and I want to
[3:41] express him and I'm sitting there
[3:42] thinking but this preacher can go this
[3:44] way and he can go that way and he could
[3:45] say this and and then it's eating me up
[3:48] and then it's like why don't you say it
[3:51] and no I'm I'm not I'm too good for that
[3:54] pulpit.
[3:58] That's eventually what comes to you.
[4:00] It's your pride standing in the way to
[4:02] humble yourself and speak the word.
[4:05] Amen. So you got what they're pushing,
[4:08] the agenda they're pushing today outside
[4:10] of in in the message is go to these
[4:13] camps, go get slain in the spirit, go
[4:16] speak with tongues, go jump up and down
[4:18] and scream, but are you speaking the
[4:21] word? Because the purpose of the day is
[4:24] take the book, speak the word.
[4:27] We've got to find that. We've I believe
[4:30] the church needs to lead us into that. I
[4:32] believe the the ministry needs to lead
[4:34] us into that. Each one of us needs to
[4:36] become speakers. And yes, I know you
[4:38] say, you know, brother Al, I'm just a
[4:40] housewife. What what do I need to speak?
[4:43] Well, you are speaking to your children.
[4:46] You're speaking with your husband.
[4:49] You're speaking in your life. You're
[4:50] speaking with your friends, with your
[4:52] families. It's it's got to come to it
[4:54] now where your life is speaking, not
[4:56] just your words. So, what do I mean by
[4:59] life? And I'm not even talking about the
[5:00] codes and standards of the message. I'm
[5:02] talking about your joy of the word must
[5:07] be expressed.
[5:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Tell it to your face, saints.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Come on. See, it's got to be that.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; I I love his word. I love his word so
[5:18] much. I JUST WANT TO SHARE IT. I WANT TO
[5:20] FELLOWSHIP WITH IT. I WANT UNENDING
[5:22] FELLOWSHIP.
[5:23] &gt;&gt; We've got to be able to see that. Not
[5:25] forms of religion, but actual loving the
[5:27] word. I can't wait to wake up in the
[5:29] morning after my sleep. My sleep is
[5:31] wasting my time. You know, I want to
[5:32] wake up in the morning, open my coffee,
[5:34] and read the word and and and speak to
[5:36] someone, express it today. You know, I
[5:39] that's what we want to see in in the
[5:41] bride of Christ. That's what we want to
[5:42] see among the people.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; As we close this down, testimony of a
[5:46] true witness. Parable 186. What church?
[5:50] What's the That's the reason I can't
[5:52] take the baptism of the Holy Ghost of
[5:55] crying, shaking, or speaking in tongues
[5:57] or any sensation.
[5:59] You hear it straight from the prophet.
[6:01] &gt;&gt; They're all right now. Them things are
[6:03] right. But the devil can impersonate
[6:06] that so real.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost is deity.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; God tabernacled in man. It's more than a
[6:15] sensation. It's more than speaking in
[6:17] tongues. is more than shouting in the
[6:19] spirit. It's more than weeping. IT'S
[6:21] MORE THAN JOINING CHURCH. IT'S God
[6:23] living in man. DEITY, GOD HIMSELF
[6:26] TABERNACLED into that person. WHEN HE
[6:29] CAN SPEAK, IT'S JUST THE SAME AS GOD
[6:32] SPEAKING.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; There's the call. He wants you to speak.
[6:36] That's the church of Jesus Christ.
[6:38] That's the way the first apostolic
[6:40] church WENT FORTH. AMEN. THAT'S this is
[6:42] what it is. THE PROPHET IS SAYING, "I
[6:44] CAN'T TAKE the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[6:46] of crying, shaking, speaking tongue,
[6:48] sensations.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; What I really want to see is God
[6:51] tabernacle deity in men speaking the
[6:54] word."
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; Uh Corinthians book of correction. We
[7:00] notice Paul could teach the Ephesians
[7:02] there how that before the foundation of
[7:04] the world, they were predestinated unto
[7:06] the adoption of sons of God. The
[7:08] Corinthians didn't know anything about
[7:10] that. They had have a little feeling of
[7:12] something, a little sensation, one this
[7:14] and that and the other and they depended
[7:16] on that. He couldn't teach them the deep
[7:19] things.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Here it is. So I think it's great that
[7:23] you got people that you can teach deep
[7:26] things. Watch this. Taking the word. The
[7:29] Holy Spirit can wind these great truths
[7:32] and anchor into the people's heart so
[7:35] they know where they're standing.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Sensation and no sensation. Prophecy, no
[7:40] prophecy, whatever it might be, take the
[7:43] word, speak the word. The prophet is
[7:45] telling us, what I really want to see is
[7:48] people you can teach the deep things to.
[7:51] &gt;&gt; They're not shunning it. They they're
[7:53] willing to take it. They're not fighting
[7:55] against it. Seventh seal is not open.
[7:57] How can this be? How can this must
[8:00] happen in the future? Uh the church goes
[8:02] up in Revelations 3 and comes back in 19
[8:04] and nothing in between is to the bride.
[8:07] They haven't received the Holy Spirit.
[8:10] They haven't received the Holy Ghost for
[8:11] this day.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; They have not responded to it because
[8:14] there's no word inside. Nothing's giving
[8:17] ability to even push the agenda.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Saints, good.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Why do people feel they need sensations?
[8:27] Because they feel they need proof.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Others around them also feel they need
[8:34] proof. Like I'm the minister. I need to
[8:36] see proof that you have the Holy Ghost.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; It's a private affair.
[8:41] &gt;&gt; It's between me and God.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. But even myself now, why do I need
[8:46] proof?
[8:48] Faith doesn't need proof.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; I believe first and evidence follows
[8:54] whenever it can.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; But I must believe.
[8:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:00] &gt;&gt; So people feel insecure,
[9:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[9:03] &gt;&gt; They don't they don't understand what's
[9:05] going on. They feel they need proof.
[9:06] Their feelings are more satisfied when
[9:08] they see evidence, visible evidence.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Why can I not be like brother so and so?
[9:14] You know, he's so lucky. He's got a
[9:16] gift. He's got this or speaking with
[9:18] tongues or prophesying or he dreams
[9:20] dreams. She sees dreams or he's he has
[9:23] visions. What about me? I got nothing.
[9:26] Right? So I I feel insecure. I feel
[9:30] inferior. I need something. The truth is
[9:33] saints emotions and sensations could
[9:36] occur in in a way that reflects a true
[9:38] experience. It can the the reason should
[9:41] be that the body
[9:44] cannot contain the revelation that the
[9:46] Holy Spirit brings in you. What I'm
[9:47] saying to you is
[9:49] there should be some expression.
[9:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; When you get the word, when God convicts
[9:54] your heart, there should be an
[9:56] expression.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; There should be an amen in your soul.
[10:00] And and maybe you're struggling with
[10:01] complex or something and you you really
[10:03] want to scream out, but you just maybe
[10:06] feel like raising your hand for now. And
[10:09] maybe you feel like you're a little shy
[10:11] that somebody is seeing you or that
[10:14] you're afraid that somebody is going to
[10:15] say something, but there's something
[10:17] happening inside. And then there's other
[10:20] people who are just boisterous,
[10:22] flamboyant, sanguin people who it's
[10:25] their character that when anything
[10:27] touches them, they're just jumping,
[10:28] screaming, and shouting. It's just
[10:30] emotions. It's it's the way they're
[10:32] made. They're different. It's emotions.
[10:35] It doesn't mean anything
[10:37] &gt;&gt; to what is going on inside. It's just an
[10:41] expression
[10:42] &gt;&gt; of something.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; But they should be an expression.
[10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. That expression indicates the
[10:49] worship.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; So the reason it is so dangerous, it is
[10:52] because people can have reactions for
[10:55] the silliest of things and it's not even
[10:58] relevant,
[10:59] &gt;&gt; right? Anyone can cry because they're
[11:01] sorry for what they've done.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; That's good because if you cry and
[11:06] you're sorry and you apologize for what
[11:08] you've done and you come into church and
[11:10] the word convicts you and you cry,
[11:12] that's good. It's good that you cry.
[11:14] It's good that you come and say, "I'm
[11:16] sorry, Lord. I repent. You know, I I
[11:18] want to put this right." You come and
[11:19] tell the pastor or something. You come
[11:21] to the altar and and you raise your
[11:23] hands. It's good that you do that. It
[11:25] still doesn't mean anything
[11:29] unless you have the Holy Spirit in you
[11:31] directing you to the word
[11:33] &gt;&gt; because even a person who does not have
[11:35] the Holy Spirit can feel sorry for what
[11:37] they did. That's right.
[11:41] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is and always has been
[11:45] about the purpose of God.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. It's the purposeful
[11:50] nature.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you've had a reaction of
[11:54] sensations, then there must be a life of
[11:57] purpose that follows.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; I I don't know if I said this here
[12:04] before. Most of the people who hit the
[12:07] ground in the Bible were demonpossessed.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; Those who willingly went down to the
[12:15] ground in the presence of the Lord rose
[12:17] up and their lives were never the same
[12:19] again.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; They woke up with a purpose.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; They didn't go back to an old lifestyle.
[12:25] When Moses bowed his head down because
[12:27] the ground he was standing on was holy
[12:29] and took off his shoe. When he rose up
[12:31] from there, he became a deliverer of a
[12:33] nation. He didn't go back to sheep
[12:35] farming on the mountain.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; You know the Bible says the prophet says
[12:39] God found him walking around living a
[12:42] life of ease.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; This prophet
[12:45] &gt;&gt; and then he meets the presence of God
[12:48] hits the ground in the presence of God
[12:50] wakes up with a purpose.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; So if there is an experience or there is
[12:54] an expression or there is some kind of
[12:56] experience of the Holy Ghost your life
[12:58] must have purpose
[13:00] &gt;&gt; from there on. Yeah.
[13:02] &gt;&gt; That's what we need to see. It is a
[13:04] purposeful nature.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe that saints?
[13:10] &gt;&gt; If you had a reaction of sensations,
[13:12] there must be purpose. That must be
[13:14] evident.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Everyone can be anointed with the
[13:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost, which is the
[13:19] earnest. But the Holy Spirit of promise
[13:23] does not come upon a person willy-nilly.
[13:26] &gt;&gt; It comes to the elect.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is it has a purpose. It has a
[13:32] directive. It leads to something in
[13:34] particular. It is the beginning of the
[13:36] process of adoption of a son.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're under tutors and
[13:43] governors. Go read Galatians chapter 4.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; A son, as long as he's not come to
[13:49] maturity, he's just a servant
[13:51] &gt;&gt; and he's under tutors and governors. But
[13:53] then when it comes to the end, he
[13:55] receives the spirit
[13:58] of the son,
[14:00] not gifts. He was under gifts all the
[14:03] time, tutors and governors. But now when
[14:06] it comes to the process of adoption to
[14:09] take purpose
[14:12] &gt;&gt; to fulfill the will of the father to
[14:15] come into that state of adoption you
[14:18] have to have the holy spirit within you
[14:20] not an anointing the divine nature the
[14:24] purpose of god to fulfill the work of
[14:26] the father to be an heir of all things.
[14:30] It signifies a closing of being under
[14:32] tutors and governors and becoming an
[14:34] heir of the promise. Saints,
[14:38] if we have the full fullness of the
[14:40] word, why do we need the baptism of the
[14:43] Holy Ghost in operation? I'm not saying
[14:46] you mustn't. I'm asking you a question.
[14:48] You say, "Brother Alistister, okay,
[14:50] look, we got the fullness of the word
[14:51] now. We got the open book. Doesn't that
[14:53] mean we don't need the baptism of the
[14:55] Holy Ghost?" No. You still need ability.
[14:58] The
[14:58] &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost gives ability
[15:00] for the present day.
[15:02] &gt;&gt; So that's what anointing is. It is
[15:05] ability. Otherwise, we're just sitting
[15:07] around doing nothing,
[15:09] &gt;&gt; right? With all this word feeding us and
[15:11] then sitting around doing nothing. You
[15:13] need anointing to incentivize you to
[15:16] give you direction what you what you
[15:18] need to do. It's like at a certain time
[15:20] you meet somebody, I don't know whether
[15:22] you use a bus stop here in Lima or
[15:24] wherever at the grocery store or
[15:26] something and somebody comes up to you
[15:27] and they notice something about you,
[15:29] something unique and they they seem to
[15:31] sense there's something different about
[15:32] you and they speak to you right there.
[15:34] The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[15:36] important
[15:37] &gt;&gt; because it needs to give you ability
[15:40] &gt;&gt; to speak to this person, to see their
[15:42] soul, to sense what's going on, to speak
[15:44] the right word because you in your right
[15:46] mind, you're still worrying about what's
[15:47] happening, about the bills, about
[15:48] something that crashed into your car.
[15:50] And and right there, you're all
[15:53] flustered, you're confused, you're
[15:54] looking at a pop and wondering whether
[15:56] you should buy it. And someone comes up
[15:58] and says, "Hi, I need some help.
[16:03] You need the bre of the Holy Ghost to
[16:04] put all those worries away and focus
[16:07] your attention because there's something
[16:09] calling and there must be a deep to
[16:11] respond.
[16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. There always is a need for
[16:16] ability.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:18] &gt;&gt; But we don't take the ability and make
[16:20] it our God.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. It is his holy spirit in us which
[16:27] is the divine nature that leads us to
[16:29] it. So the word is what your soul, if
[16:32] you understand who you are, the word in
[16:34] your soul is what you are married to.
[16:36] This flesh and your mind is not married
[16:40] to that word.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; This flesh and this mind needs the
[16:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Young people,
[16:47] &gt;&gt; because this flesh and this body and
[16:49] mind has different abilities. In my
[16:51] life, I had abilities of playing
[16:53] cricket, being a sportsman, doing art,
[16:57] playing music. You know, playing music
[16:59] is a very dangerous thing. If you if you
[17:02] have gift or play by ear, you can pick
[17:03] up all sorts of tunes and play it. But
[17:05] when you get the Holy Ghost, you're
[17:06] going to dedicate that gift to only his
[17:08] purpose.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; See, but without the Holy Ghost, you're
[17:12] just going to drift anywhere with it.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Right? Those abilities need to be
[17:16] reigned in to be used for the purpose of
[17:19] the word. Amen.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the word is what your soul is
[17:25] married to. But this animal needs the
[17:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; This animal needs the anointing. And the
[17:33] anointing is what gives it abilities it
[17:35] could not ordinarily have. That's why
[17:38] it's important. Anyone can be anointed
[17:41] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[17:42] which is the earnest. But the Holy
[17:44] Spirit of promise comes to the elect.
[17:47] You believe him, saints? That's why the
[17:49] Holy Spirit is necessary. What is the
[17:52] Holy Spirit then? It is the influence of
[17:56] the word for your day.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; The purposeful nature.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Spirit is nature. The Holy Spirit is the
[18:06] influence of the word for your day. And
[18:09] that influence is going to cause your
[18:11] body and your spirit to fall in line
[18:14] with the word that you are married to.
[18:16] Yes.
[18:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's understand that we came into
[18:20] this flesh. Uh born in sin, shapen in
[18:23] iniquity, come into this world, speaking
[18:25] lies as the prophet said. We we uh come
[18:29] with our own desires. We have our own
[18:31] ideas of things. We have our own way of
[18:34] doing things. We sometimes think, well,
[18:36] I'm just going to preach this this way
[18:37] and you know, people just have to accept
[18:39] it and uh this is how I do things. But
[18:42] it becomes ineffective unless the Holy
[18:45] Spirit is the one guiding us.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand
[18:51] why they wrote it differently in the
[18:53] Bible?
[18:54] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference? Do you
[18:56] understand the difference between the
[18:58] anointing and the person?
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Do you understand the difference between
[19:02] the ability and the purposeful nature?
[19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Now, you need to know when you read the
[19:09] word what it is that you have, what it
[19:12] is that you seek,
[19:14] &gt;&gt; what it is that God must give to you,
[19:16] what it is that you are lacking. Maybe
[19:18] if you have a desire in your heart to do
[19:21] something for the gospel, you need
[19:23] ability for that. And you need and God's
[19:25] ability is not going to be one that must
[19:27] bring failure. It must be a success for
[19:30] the kingdom.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you're you other a lot of
[19:35] people will also feel like I want to I
[19:37] want to be a preacher but there's just
[19:38] no gift there. I want to be a pastor but
[19:41] there's just no wisdom in you. I want to
[19:43] be a deacon but you're just a big old
[19:45] softy who's never going to be able to
[19:47] correct anybody.
[19:48] And yet in a time of need God can give
[19:52] you the Holy Ghost to fulfill that need
[19:55] because the word has inspired you beyond
[19:58] what you what abilities you have. Yes.
[20:01] Sometimes a big old softy can be someone
[20:03] who can bring good correction.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; God can do that. Only God can change you
[20:08] and people the people will recognize the
[20:11] spirit of God has worked in his life.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. You love him saints.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; This is the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[20:18] Spirit. The purposeful nature of God.
[20:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's bow our heads
