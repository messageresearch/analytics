TRANSCRIPT
========================================
What is the truth of this, Sean? What is that apple? Huh? Who says it's an apple? Casey, it's an apple. Yeah. Uh, no. What happened to our Africanas? &gt;&gt; Brother Mark, well, you have a Uber surname. &gt;&gt; I'm French. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Okay. You said it's an apple. Yes, Seth. It's an apple. In Africans, it's apple. What's it in sha? Brother Robert. Brother Robert. Huh? &gt;&gt; Okay. Anybody knows what it's in Zulu? &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, how about Japanese? [laughter] How about Chinese? How about Arabian? Yeah. So, is it an apple or is it not an apple? Okay. What is the truth of this apple? How do you know it's an apple? Where are your link sources and reliable [laughter] people with credentials? What is the truth? What color is it? Huh? &gt;&gt; Red. Yes. And and where does it where do you get it from? &gt;&gt; A tree. It grows in a tree. So all we got so far are facts. Now I want someone here to tell me what is the truth of an apple. I'm waiting. What is the truth of an apple? You know what's the truth of an apple? Somebody who doesn't know what it's called, where it comes from, but they know what to do with it. What do you do with an apple? &gt;&gt; Right now, how many of you can describe to me in the best language what an apple tastes like? &gt;&gt; Yes, buddy. &gt;&gt; A strawberry. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Anybody? Anybody who's so educated? Where is it? Yes. Like juicy. Yeah, it is. It is juicy. But who can describe to me what it tastes like, [clears throat] Abby? It's sweet. Yeah, but what's sweet? Sweet has mean sugary. You adults who are you got your degrees and you guys with degrees in whatever. &gt;&gt; What does it taste like? [laughter] &gt;&gt; There you go. It tastes like an apple. WHICH MEANS AFTER 6,000 YEARS of eating apples, you cannot describe to me what an apple tastes like. YOU CANNOT TELL me what it tastes like. YOU CANNOT EVEN USE FIVE words to describe it. You can only tell me it tastes like an apple. SHE MEANS ALL THE KNOWLEDGE. YES, brother Liam. &gt;&gt; Doesn't taste like an orange. &gt;&gt; There you go. [laughter] So, all we have is, reliable sources, but the truth you cannot describe. You can give it to an infant who doesn't know what it is, where it comes from, uh how it grows, what its seed looks like, what its tree looks like, which ground it grew up in. Most of you here don't even know what's the biological name of apple, right? Do you know that once apple was the universal name for all fruit? This is why you have art apple and every other apple in the Dutch because they used to call any fruit the apple of the tree. Did you know that? BUT YOU CANNOT TELL ME THE TRUTH OF AN APPLE. BUT YET YOU KNOW the truth of an apple. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE TRUTH of an apple even though you you you GOT ALL THE FACTS AND YOU THE FACTS ARE NOT EVEN TASTY. Whether it's red, whether it's shape, whatever it is, what grounded grow, none of that is important. NONE OF THAT PRODUCES ANY POWER IN YOU. BUT YOU know it's good for you. You know you can eat it. You know you can taste it. You can't EXPLAIN THAT. THAT'S the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The rest is evidence and knowledge. Oh, taste and see &gt;&gt; that the Lord is good &gt;&gt; with all the knowledge you can have, with all the preaching, with all the theology, with all the Bible schools, with all the the doctrines you can have, if you don't taste, all you have is knowledge. This is the reason all those who study theology and Bible and even the message if you haven't met him &gt;&gt; the only people who POSSESS THE TRUTH AND ARE POSSESSED OF THE TRUTH are the ones who have met him &gt;&gt; who have tasted of the heavenly gift that's the people who have the truth &gt;&gt; and those are the people who can tell you when you're preaching in error And when you're pre when you're not, you can have a lady who is a housewife who irons clothes and washes CLOTHES AND STUFF AND DOES NOT STUDY DOCTRINES, BUT SHE CAN tell you you're preaching wrong. &gt;&gt; Because she has tasted. &gt;&gt; So if you believe in facts, I want to ask you young people today, how much evidence do you need to fully believe that God exists and he created the universe and the world we live in today? How much evidence is enough to make you believe in God? How about when does the evidence stop? Right now, science is a baby. Do you know that? &gt;&gt; Science like started a few hundred years ago because that's when they were able to collect evidence that could prove anything or something. &gt;&gt; Truth needs an element of faith. See, that's the thing. Evidence doesn't need faith. Evidence needs recognition. Which is why when you're having conversation with people and you're presenting evidence and facts and and concepts and whatever, they're just looking at it as knowledge. You're not telling them truth because the truth is too much for them to be TO TO BE PUT INTO WORDS. If truth does not come by revelation, you cannot possess it. Amen. &gt;&gt; If everything is about evidence, where is the faith? &gt;&gt; If there is no faith, there is no power. IF THERE IS NO POWER, there is no change to life. You can GIVE PEOPLE ALL THE FACTS, IT WILL NOT CHANGE their life. [snorts] What do people Why do people not believe though there is an abundance of evidence? Right? What about the seventh seal? Listen to this saints. We we have to preach the seven seal TO PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO PREACH WHAT THE FIRST FOLD IS, the second fold, third fold. Do you is there any mystery as to why people don't believe what we say when we present them evidence? &gt;&gt; Because unless they taste and see, they will never know. Yeah, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN PRODUCE ALL THE QUOTES YOU want in a specific format, under a different subject, under a different heading, under a different teaching. Unless they connect with the Holy Spirit himself, there's no way, there's no convincing. There's no certain ministry. &gt;&gt; Listen, I want to ask I want to be as clear with you as possible. What proof do we have of Christ? What evidence do we have of Christ? the shroud of Turin, the witnesses of men. How do you know he was born of a virgin? How do you know he raised from the dead? How do you know who wrote to the book of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? What evidence did do you have that the words written in those gospels are actually the word of Christ? Do you know? Can you prove it? Can you prove that Noah built an ark and there was a flood? Do you have evidence that Moses opened up the Red Sea? Do you have evidence that Daniel killed Goliath with one stone? Do you have evidence, proof, facts, links, sources, or anyone with authority to tell you and prove to you everything that there is in the Bible? No, you don't. No one has it. Though people will try archaeology, this finding under the temple mount, this finding the sh of Turin, this in the cave, this, it proves nothing. It doesn't even matter. It's what you believe. &gt;&gt; It's not the evidence that changed lives and made people repent of sin. It's faith. IT'S THE BELIEF THAT it was truth that changed lives that changed governments and constitutions AND RESHAPED SOCIETY. IT WASN'T ACTUAL EVIDENCE. TODAY THEY THEY CRYING FOR EVIDENCE FOR A GOD FOR THE ONE WHO CREATED THE UNIVERSE. BUT THE FAITH changed people &gt;&gt; countries. The the FAITH CHANGES A DRUG ADDICT TO BEING CLEAN IN ONE DAY. &gt;&gt; NOT EVIDENCE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. And I'm talking to you. What proof do we have of William Brandham? What proof do we have of the cloud outside of the picture? What proof do we have of the mysterious week when he preached the seals? Do you realize our entire teaching and belief is based on the dreams and visions of a man &gt;&gt; who was born in Kentucky, &gt;&gt; who claims to have had the angel visit him, who saw dreams and visions &gt;&gt; and who spoke in words that were uneducated &gt;&gt; and without proper grammar. You you mean our lives, our marriages, our raising of our children, the jobs we choose, the way we dress, the holiday places we go to is defined BY WHAT THAT MAN TAUGHT US. Why would you follow it? There's only one reason is because your faith changed you somehow. &gt;&gt; And you'll not change from that. No matter what evidence is produced in you, you and I know what it did for us &gt;&gt; because we've tasted. &gt;&gt; And when you've tasted, there's no words to describe it. &gt;&gt; You are the proof. You are the evidence. You are the only evidence. You you cannot even depend on on your your mind, your reasoning, on how you read the message and how you construct the doctrine out of it. YOU CAN'T. IT'S HOW IT IS REVEALED &gt;&gt; AND WHEN IT IS REVEALED when you TASTE AND WHAT IT DOES TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; That's all. &gt;&gt; Other than that, you get nothing. You can produce the best music in your church. YOU CAN PRODUCE THE BEST ANOINTING IN YOUR CHURCH. YOU CAN HAVE PEOPLE FALLING DOWN, CRYING, AND ALL OF THAT. IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO PRODUCE anything &gt;&gt; or or prove to you anything or change you. There must be a personal connection with the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the truth shall set you free. &gt;&gt; Everything we have is based on another man's dreams, visions, and experiences. On that statement alone, that's enough to say, "Let's walk away." Because if I came here next week and told you I had dreams, visions, and prophecies, and I saw an angel, are you just going to believe me? No. What proof do we have of Christ? Why is your whole life depended on the words of Christ and prophets who you have not met, who you do not know? Truth is not received by evidence, young people, but by believing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is why I'm encouraging you in your life with your husband and wife, with your children, with your parents, believe in each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's a better life. Believe in one another. Don't think proof and evidence makes your life better. It doesn't. It makes it worse. Believe one another. &gt;&gt; Love one. To love one is to believe them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sons of God, truth is not received by evidence and by believing but by believing. Sons of God will find truth. And the truth is God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the knowledge of the truth is Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So if the knowledge of the knowledge reveals the truth, then the word is truth. If the knowledge does not reveal the truth, it's not the truth. &gt;&gt; So you can have preaching and teaching in Christian churches that does not lead you to God. That means that knowledge is just knowledge. It's not truth. It doesn't have truth in it. See, Christ is the word and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. The word was in the beginning with God and the word was God. &gt;&gt; The word must lead you to God. &gt;&gt; And when you taste that word and if you taste truth, you'll never change from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If Christ reveals God, then Christ is God. Yes. &gt;&gt; Sons of God then who search for the word and find truth. Those sons of God search for Christ and find God. And what happens when you have truth? The truth possesses you. &gt;&gt; When sons of God find truth, then they are possessed by the truth. &gt;&gt; You love him, saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
