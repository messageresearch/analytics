TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Ephesians 1 and verse 7-11. Ephesians 1 7-11. I I really love the book of Ephesians. Really really wonderful book. says, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth, even in him. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who workketh all things after the counsel of his will. Amen. &gt;&gt; We have obtained an inheritance. You may be seated. Glory to God. We like to greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Certainly good to be with the saints this morning and sharing the word of God. You happy to be here this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So uh this is going to be the the story of God and man part three and um becoming sons part two. Amen. Becoming sons of God part two. And so for a title uh we're going to speak on the road to adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. The road to adoption. Now uh adoption um is a is a a subject that people have been speaking about for a very long time and uh I would say from all my years in the message um people still don't understand. People have strange ideas about it. Some people feel that it's the manifestation of great things like miracles. Some people feel like it's got to be the restoration of the gifts from the book of Acts like Acts chapter 2 where they they came out with great signs and wonders and spoke in tongues and prophesied and then went off doing great uh miracles of healing and uh discernment and raising people from the dead and um and um so I I understand those statements. I understand those things. I just, you know, want to tell the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't see the point raising you from the dead. &gt;&gt; Because if you were connected with your theophony, why would you want to come back here? &gt;&gt; And in fact, anybody who had reached the seven dimension and you had to raise the guy from the dead is going to say to you, why? &gt;&gt; Why did you bring me back? &gt;&gt; So, I don't understand the need for going back to those things. Those things were necessary to show the gospel to people who had not heard the word &gt;&gt; because of course raising someone from the dead would shock pagans and heathens to say this must be God. &gt;&gt; Now it's 2,000 years have passed. &gt;&gt; Right? So people um identify adoption as this thing that's going to produce miracles and wonders that's going to wow the world. And it's so uh amazing to me that people in the message still believe that knowing that Revelations 13 tells you that that second beast that rises out of the land is going to do miracles &gt;&gt; in the sight of men and God that's going to fool the world and lead the world into the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; So what then is adoption? Now our title is the road to adoption. Adoption is a very commonly used term in the message and very important uh part of becoming sons. Now adoption is no doubt one of the most mysterious attributes of the relationship between God and man. That's why it falls in under our story, the story of God and man. Right? Adoption is the worldly understanding that applies that implies that a child who has no father is given favor to have a father and become a son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the meaning. &gt;&gt; A child who probably was born and uh let's give you an example like his parents died and so he's got no parents. he's living in an orphanage or something who's been taken by somebody else, but then somebody comes along to say, "I want to adopt you." So, in our terms today, it's like somebody just taking a an orphan and giving them a home. But adoption from way back was about inheritance. &gt;&gt; Yes. So a man who would adopt a child would be a man who had no child himself. But this man has an inheritance and he would like to give it to somebody when he dies. &gt;&gt; So he's going to adopt someone who he feels has the character or he'd like to take on this child to to put in to him a character &gt;&gt; that he could pass that inheritance on to. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the process of adoption, the road to adoption is to build up this strange child into a character that is going to respect me as father. Also is going to love the inheritance I'm going to give to him &gt;&gt; and respect it enough to take care of my name as if it is his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adoption is nowhere near what people have today. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament and from the beginning, adoption would not be necessary if there was no inheritance. &gt;&gt; Today, it's more like, you know, people struggle to have a child, so let's adopt a child. And and often times in in today's world, you you take a child and you've got no inheritance to pass on to them. You know, it's it's we don't really have much inheritance today &gt;&gt; except what's in our bank account and a few policies, you know, and maybe some land and a house and that's not even important. The the kids will grow up and they'll just sell this house, you know, let's just split the money and there's a whole bunch of fights after mom and dad die. You know, there's no love for the house or the love for the inheritance or treasuring the land or great heritage and let's keep this going for the next 200 years. There's no love for it. &gt;&gt; This doesn't even occur to us today. Adoption in the Bible has always been about inheritance. &gt;&gt; We have obtained an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Thank you. So when when trying to understand adoption, this is why I'm saying when people think adoption is the gifts and the and the signs and the wonders. What is that your inheritance? What does that even mean? Right? Oh, we we inherited the power of almighty God. No, still far from it. So in trying to understand adoption of sons through the word of the Lord Jesus Christ, it is a revelation, the understanding of adoption is a revelation that defies all logic and reasonability. &gt;&gt; In other words, if I had to look at you bunch, I would never take you. &gt;&gt; See, I told you. Just tell the truth. [laughter] If I had to look at myself, I would never understand why God would choose me. [snorts] &gt;&gt; I I would find every possible reason for him not to have chosen me. &gt;&gt; And if I had to look at the world or look at in fact in the Bible, Revelations 5, when we look at the question, who is worthy? And the fact that no man is found worthy is enough. So it defies all logic and reasonable thinking. &gt;&gt; It's a mystery that tells us that we we were born into a world having nothing. We were born into a world being orphans. We have no spiritual father. Without the word of God, whose philosophy do you follow? Where does your spiritual inheritance come from? Whose thinking do you adopt? Whose character do you look to? Not even your parents. You start defying your parents from the time you turn 16. You you rebel against your teachers. You hate the system of government. You rebel against politicians. Who do you choose? Do you have a a an Aristotle or a Socrates or a whoever? A Mahatma Gandhi or a Nelson Mandela figure that you will say I want to choose that man's legacy to keep who you don't have anybody. You're an orphan. &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not worthy of anything to teach anyone morality the right way. You're not worthy to run a government. There isn't a single government that is worthy today to lead mankind. Nobody tells the truth. Nobody has true morals. Nobody can teach kindness, gentleness, longsuffering. Everyone is a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; In other words, we're orphans. Morally, we are orphans. We have We're born into this world. We come into this world speaking lies. &gt;&gt; We come into this world worthy of only one place and that is hell. &gt;&gt; Right? So yet something inside of us in this entire world of orphans leads us to believe something that brings us to an understanding that we must be born again &gt;&gt; of the spirit. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Totally illogical mystery. &gt;&gt; Everyone looks at us and says we're crazy. When we receive that new birth, we begin to see new things. And it leads us to believe that we are not of this world. That's a second craziness. Cuz everyone around us, our relatives, your cultures, your races, wherever you come from, the people you meet, the educated people today now who are becoming, you know, these great moral hierarchies around us who can teach us what is right and what is true and what is moral. They all tell us we're crazy. Born again, &gt;&gt; Christianity, the Bible, the world will tell us if we say we come from another place, they they're ready to put you in an institution. It's such a mysterious phenomenon that takes adoption. When it when when the new birth grabs a hold of you, it grabs a hold of your conscious and subconscious mind. It's that kind of mystery. And this experience makes us do things unreasonable like it refuses, it makes us refuse ties to the present world. It makes you deny things that can make you feel good temporarily. It makes you feel like uh like I'm doing something wrong if I indulge in a certain pleasure. Nobody else feels that way. And then when we realize that we realize it's a real struggle. It's a struggle to accept this new birth and this process of adoption when we came from when where we came from and because of who we are and who we are now. But we know we have to be uh we have we know what we have to do in order to take ownership of what rightly belongs to us. We know that there's something in God, something in his word. We've come to this understanding through the new birth that there's something we have to do to take ownership of something and it's it's massive. The magnitude of it uh really bewilders us. So in this process of adoption, we have to recognize two things. All right? And it's so easy to understand. If you are an orphan, &gt;&gt; how do you know you're adopted? The first thing is you have to recognize your father. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you haven't recognized your father, and that's a big deal right there, then you don't even know you're you're adopted or that there's a process of adoption going on. So, the first thing is you have to recognize we have a father that we need to accept is it's not he it's not just him telling you, I'm adopting you. You have to accept his fatherhood. &gt;&gt; And then after getting to know that this is his desire for you and you are accepting his desire for you, you then have to look at his inheritance because that is the reason he is adopting you. It's got to do with his inheritance. It's got to do with what he wants to give to you. &gt;&gt; And you have to be you have to have an affinity to it. &gt;&gt; You have to love it. You have to cherish his adoption because the the experience of cherishing his inheritance is going to make you have an incentive, an objective to continue in this journey. &gt;&gt; Yeah. to refuse everything else and any other kind of inheritance this world has to offer because that is in the forefront of your vision. &gt;&gt; That's what you're that's your objective. &gt;&gt; Am I making it clear? &gt;&gt; We have a father. We have an inheritance that we have to desire. Young people, you you cannot give your life to the message because you think it's a good idea. &gt;&gt; You you you can't do this to please your parents or to be a part of the church. &gt;&gt; You have to at at some point in your life come to a decision that there is an objective. &gt;&gt; You have to make a mature decision. This is not a childish decision. This is not a group think decision. This isn't a decision to be made by feelings or emotions. You have to have a time in your life where you sit down really soberly and realize the responsibility that is upon me to complete this journey to finish this road. Amen. Ephesians 1:11 says we have past tense obtained an inheritance. That means the inheritance has been revealed to us and we have obtained that inheritance in Christ. The Bible says so the questions are what is the inheritance and why do we have to take it? You know, can't I just like stick around in the father's domain and let him bless me? Why do I have to be this responsible son to take over the inheritance? &gt;&gt; It it makes you think of the the prodical son story, right? Who went and and um he took his own inheritance and squandered it through the world &gt;&gt; but and his older brother got his inheritance. But after squandering it, he comes back and the father gives him what is his. In other words, the father's domain was going to be split three ways. The one brother got it. This one wasted that. But then eventually he got the the father's portion. So he was not left without an inheritance. Amen. No matter what happens, God is going to provide something. He has provided something. Amen. and you are going to fight against it in your life, your natural life. And this is what makes this road so incredible. So first we have to see that there is an actual inheritance and that we are the ones to take it. Right? Are we there? &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go to Christ declares the father. Okay. Now if you So now what we're showing you is the reason for the Lord Jesus Christ to come because without the Lord Jesus Christ coming you don't know the father. &gt;&gt; So the whole point of him coming was to declare the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The the the reason for the first coming is to show the father to declare the father to mankind. &gt;&gt; What does that imply? That prior to Christ the father was not known. He was not known as the father because people could not see him see themselves as his sons there. They could have this idea that they were children of Israel, children of Abraham. Look at the contest in the time of Christ where he was questioning the Pharisees and they said first Abraham is our father and he says if you were Abraham's children you would. And then finally he said God is our father. And he said if you he said if you if God was your father you would believe my words that I speak unto you. &gt;&gt; Then he says to them you are of your father the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The entire contest was about father. He claimed he came to declare the father to the world. Those people who claimed to be children of Abraham and then by that virtue claimed to be children of God were actually orphans who were never receiving the spirit of adoption. &gt;&gt; They didn't realize though they were they were children of Abraham by natural birth, they were children of the devil by spiritual birth. &gt;&gt; Christ declares the father. If you really take saints, if you really take a whole week to fast and pray the right way, not traditionally, and I tell you just to meditate on what Christ truly is to you and me, it will elevate you to another level of consciousness in this life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To know what Jesus Christ is, that he came to declare the father. I I couldn't even explain it to you in I mean if you yourself meditate on the word and take even a week to just meditate on what Christ actually means that he came to declare the invisible God. &gt;&gt; Just the reality of that the Lord Jesus said clearly I came to declare the father. Why you cannot receive? Are you with me? You cannot receive sunship until you become conscious of the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot claim to be a son or daughter of God unless you become conscious of the father. &gt;&gt; How could you ever know the father unless he became the son to show you the father? And then look at the beautiful part of all this. He's he's there with them and Philip asked Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us. Yes, &gt;&gt; this is this is what I'm saying his ministry was actually about. Even says to them, uh, look at, you know, don't judge me for these things. Judge me for the work's sake. Are these not the works of the father? &gt;&gt; In many different ways. And now he says to Philillip and them, he says, have I been with you so long and still you say, show us the father? In other words, he's he's the the word in the gospels is saying to us his ministry was showing the father. &gt;&gt; Why were they still not catching it, right? So, how could you know the father unless he became the son? That's the purpose of becoming the son because the son declares the father. That in itself is another ministry because if you now claim to be the sons of God, it means your life must declare the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what it is all about. &gt;&gt; Right? So how could you and I ever become conscious that you could have come from God from where we were born from where we came from? our countries, our ancestorries, all of those things. We can trace all those things back to heathens, pagans, you name it. How could you and I on our own ever without Christ, without the gospels, without the word, without the prophets, without the angels of the seven church ages, how could you and I in 2025 ever come to the epiphany that we came from God? Then we can obtain his inheritance. No man alive could do that. &gt;&gt; Do you understand the purpose of Jesus Christ? to declare the father to connect mankind to know you have a father. I remember some time ago could have been last year I think when I was preaching on fatherhood and parenthood. You remember that and I told you what what fatherhood means. Fatherhood means to to provide um direction and purpose for a son. Right? So fatherhood is not just having a parent. And to me, this is this is a ridiculous thing about Christians today. To them, to have a father means heal my sickness, give me food, help me pay my rent, help me pay my bills, you know, give me clothing, make give me good luck in everything and then I'll serve you. And it's kind of like what children today believe. Children today want the house, they want clothes, they want the new cell phones, they want Wi-Fi, they want uh pleasures in life. But do they actually care about the father, father's reputation? Do they care about the father's job? Do they care about the father's house? Do they have any pride in their father's home? In their father's house, in his name? Do the children today have any pride in the name of their father? You know how um I I wish these traditions would still be kept. These are some of the traditions I like. You know uh in the Jewish homes when you when you come to a h to a house just on the side of the lintil is a hole in the wall with a scroll and inside the scroll is the names of all your ancestors in your father's bloodline. And when you every time doesn't matter how many times you walk into the house, you touch that scroll. &gt;&gt; I'm saying if you walked into the house, you touched a scroll. You went you forgot to some your wallet in the car, you went back to the car, you come back, you touch a scroll, &gt;&gt; you are entering your father's house, &gt;&gt; and with that blessing is the blessing of all your bloodline. &gt;&gt; Amen. And one day when you die, your name will be written on that scroll. &gt;&gt; People today, sons today do not have the respect anymore for their father's names. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I don't blame the sons. I I I blame the fathers for not teaching them what their bloodline is, what their heritage is, who they are. Why should I be proud in my father's name? Why not tell them the stories? Why not tell them where we come from? Tell them uh h how how you came to be in this place. It doesn't matter how some sometimes how bad the stories are or how terrible fathers we once had, but you are here today because of them. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how bad your life is. You are here today because of them. You owe them that much. You can hate them. You can hate what they did. You can hate that maybe they gave you a poor upbringing. Whatever it is, but you should have enough integrity and honor in you to honor your bloodline, where you come from. &gt;&gt; The house you were raised in, &gt;&gt; whatever situation, even if you came up in bad situations, it made you into the person you are today. It made you into the person who has a specific unique set of characteristics that nobody else has. &gt;&gt; So how could you ever become conscious of God without Christ being manifested? &gt;&gt; Impossible. And that's what believing in Christ really is about then. Because when you truly believe in Christ, then Romans 8 comes into full effect. All right, let's look at Romans 8 from verse 14- 16. This is another scripture just glossed over and evangelized [snorts] on and preached about with great enthusiasm and charisma, but zero understanding. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. We could spend years on that. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, "Aba, Father." The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God. Here is the starting point of the road to adoption. This doesn't mean you Paul is saying we have been adopted like these fellas running around saying you know the first church they had the open book they had everything they had the fullness if they did why weren't they raptured if they did why why did they descend so much in doctrine why didn't they had the unity of understanding of the word you have received the spirit of adoption okay so I want to bring this to to our understanding. Paul is not saying I'm an adopted son. I I have been adopted. He's not saying I have full adoption and I have full power over all this earth and I I've come to claim this whole earth is mine. He's not saying that. He's saying you have the spirit of adoption. There's a difference between the spirit of adoption and the fullness of adoption. &gt;&gt; Right? You have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry aba. Abba in the Hebrew is father. So let me rephrase this. You have received the spirit or the understanding or the revelation of who your father is. That's what it means. It has been made known to you who your father is. This is why you cry aba. Prior to this, you couldn't cry aba. You couldn't say father. You couldn't know father. So this is saying you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear. You have received the spirit of adoption. You have received a revelation. You have received something from God that has opened up your eyes that he is your father. &gt;&gt; That's the beginning. You know, if I had to put this into into perspective, if you or into real understanding, if you had to adopt a little child, let's say a three-year-old, four-year-old child, that child doesn't know where you come from, who what your name is, what your surname is, the child only looks at you with glistening eyes and it wants food and it wants you to play. It wants some cuddles. It wants you to put it to sleep. It wants you to comfort it when it's crying. That's all it's looking for, right? And it's looking at mom and dad and it's it's judging between the two of you and it's going to grow. All it has is the spirit of adoption. It now recognizes you as its caregiver, as its protector. It's a spirit of adoption. That means when it walks in the outside world and it sees something scary, it's going to look for you. Ah, there you are. and run to you. It only has the spirit of adoption. What? That whenever there's a problem, Aba, right? That's the spirit of adoption. And so when when things are right or it's given you some kind of identity like this is where I stay. Why is that where you stay? Because that's where Abba stays. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's where father stays. That's where mother stays. So that's where I stay. If mother and father don't stay there anymore, I won't claim that as where I stay [snorts] because now they moved to a different home or a different house. So it's where they are that's where I stay. Spirit of adoption. Are you with us? So the road to adoption begins with receiving the spirit of adoption. Why is it linked to the not being the spirit of bondage? Because that's what orphanages are. It's bondage. If you're kept trapped in a place where you have no identity, you're just with a whole bunch of other people. You have no purpose. You have no direction. You have no singular person to look to. You're an orphan. Amen. And only after receiving the spirit of adoption do you realize that there is something reserved for you. &gt;&gt; And you know how it goes. Over birthdays and you know different times of celebration, father is going to give you a present. You're going to look for something. You're going to have gifts. Gifts. Are you getting it? Somebody say amen. You can have gifts very often while you're growing to maturity and then at a certain point the gifts stop. See road to adoption. All right, let's go to our inheritance. One major theme of the Bible seems to be about I mean you should know this, right? We're doing we're in uh on our Wednesday nights we're on Genesis the book of Genesis. We're doing a Bible study in the book of Genesis and we've reached Genesis 12. Up to Genesis 12, how many lineages have we already been through, right? And this one begat that one, and this one begat that one, and this one begat that one, and this one married this woman, and they begat this one, and this was the the the lineage of Noah, and the lineage of Abram. We've already just been through 12 chapters and we already see from the beginning there is a there is um an emphasis placed on lineage on bloodlines. Why? Because of inheritance. You wouldn't need to track bloodlines or lineages if there was no inheritance to pass down. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So sometime after the flood, God promises to Abraham that I will make you a father of many nations. Now, that's a problem. Think of that. I mean, some of you complain about having two kids. Imagine having 12 and more. You know, Abraham didn't just stop with Isaac. He then married Coutura. He had Ishmael through Hagga, married Coutura, and had other sons and daughters. Can can you imagine dividing your inheritance amongst all these children? Hey, some of you complain about the will that you have to make for just three kids and hoping they stay and they keep their their holy ghost after you die so that they can get on peaceibly and you know not fight like a bunch of heathens after you're dead over money. Can you imagine having 12 or more kids? And he tells him, you're going to be the father of many nations. Okay? Which means immediately if you're going to be the father of many nations, you had better keep your bloodlines perfect because we are not passing down our land to somebody who has confused the bloodlines. This land does not go to anyone but our bloodline. Do you understand the problem in Israel right now? the Middle East all has to do with bloodlines. So, we can see the pattern start there in a literal earthly sense. Abraham's bloodline. Okay, let's read Galatians 3:29. If you be Christs, then are you Abraham's seed and hes according to the promise. So Paul is now linking us to God's promise to Abraham. I don't know about you. I'm from my family comes from central India. I don't know whether I'm physically linked to Abraham somehow. I'm probably linked to Noah through Japheth somewhere. And some of you are from Africa, some of you originate from Europe. There's no Jews among us this morning, I think. And uh so none of you have any physical links to Abraham, literal links to but he says through Christ you become an inheritor. You are Abraham's seed through Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wonder what those Jews have to say about that. &gt;&gt; Right. So he says this after saying this that we are we have this link to Abraham's inheritance. Can you imagine walking into Israel right now and say listen one day Jerusalem is going to be mine friends because I believe in Christ. &gt;&gt; You guys don't get too comfortable here. That's not going to make them happy. Let's go to Hebrews 11 verse 10. And this is what's beautiful. For he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Who's that? That's speaking of Abraham. So Abraham had this land of Israel, the plains of memory, Hebron, which is, you know, Hebrew, which means from the oaks, and the people from that region were then called the Hebrews. And that later became Israel and Judea from uh uh Yehudi which is where the word Jew comes from. Judea. And so they were first called Hebrews and then Yehud which means Judah or or or and then later Jews. Uh and this man had this land. He had this inheritance. God took him from the Chaldes and brought him out to to uh Hebron and Judea. and he got this land and here am I. I mean, I'm I'm here. And then the scripture says he's looking for a city which has foundations whose builder and maker is God. Clearly, even after he got that, he was still looking for something. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And he believed he was an inheritor of that. That's what we are inheritors of. What he was looking for. Amen. &gt;&gt; So where in Genesis does it say that Abraham looked for a city built by God? Where where does it say that? Where does Paul get this from? Then Paul goes on to say that all those of Abraham's seed looked for a country. So you go and read further down from Hebrews 11:10, you're going to see he says they all looked for a country, but they died not having received the promises. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So clearly he was not talking about the literal land of Israel. &gt;&gt; Verse 16 says, "But now they, that means all those great heroes of the faith, having received some promises for their day, they desire a better country that is and heavenly." &gt;&gt; Now you see us coming back to that story of man and God. They desire in heavenly country. Wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God. For he has prepared for them a city. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. A city which has foundations whose builder and maker is God. &gt;&gt; And Christians took this and thought, well, &gt;&gt; when we're inside those gates of pearl, we'll learn a lot of things. Amen. There'll be roads of paved with gold and gates of pearls and all the great riches and wonders and precious stones and lights and just you know we'll be walking around and playing harps and I don't know that's what Christians believe nowadays that heaven is going to be this mystical magical place that God is going to take us away to leaving all our miseries behind and we'll be so oblivious of all the suffering of all those naughty people on earth cuz we were God's good boys. H no they said they were looking for a city a country the word foundations a city which have foundations. All cities have foundations. What are you talking about? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Foundations means or implies incorruptible, unbreakable and something which comes from before the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where were you Job when I laid the foundations? &gt;&gt; From before the beginning, &gt;&gt; the foundation it has origins. &gt;&gt; Abram was looking for that place, that city. So we know that, excuse me, the Bible said this, but if you and I are heirs, H E I R S, inheritors, right? I um I know when I when I first came to Durban. I heard the people saying we are hairs. Please forgive um our Indian brothers because uh in the Indian languages we drop hes and pick them up you know in different places. So um like where are you at where are you at? So in the Indian languages they the vowels are different and so on. So the reason I'm saying this, I'm trying to teach you the heirs. H E I R S is pronounced heirs. We are heirs of the father. We are not hes of the father. Okay. But we are inheritors. You don't mind teaching a little bit of English. Okay. We want to speak it right. Especially when you sing in the song, we are we are heirs of the father, joint hes with the son. You are inheritors. &gt;&gt; Amen. We know what that the Bible said this. But if we are inheritors, what is our inheritance and where is it? If Abram didn't receive it in his day and his natural children couldn't obtain it in their day, is there an inheritance outstanding? Where is it? Clearly, the Bible says they did not receive it. Right? Go and read it. Now, so there is an inheritance outstanding. Outstanding means it's still available. It's still to be taken, right? And it would not be said that we are heirs of the father of through the promise of Christ. It would not be said that we are inheritors if there was not an inheritance outstanding. You agree? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; All right. So let's look at the first step forward toward our inheritance. So what is the first step? How do we get to know our inheritance? Colossians 1:12, giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light, who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son. So, let's break this down to make it clear, right? Made us meet. That didn't mean make us get together. The word meet means possible. Made it possible. Made it likely. Made it. Uh um like for example um in [clears throat] the beginning where it says the woman was made a help meet, &gt;&gt; right? It's it's not about um gathering or meeting together. It wasn't even help made and not just possible but so when Adam was alone and he needed a help meet it means somebody who qualified a qualifying help uh someone relatable. Are you with us? So you put all that in, he made us qualified. He made us relatable. He made us He made it possible for us to be inheritors, partakers of the inheritance. That's what it means to be a meat. Okay, got it. Obviously, I'm I'm really I I could express this differently. Believe me, I'm really dumbing this down. Like the prophet says, "So the little guy can get it." Okay. So God made us relatable to the inheritance. He did something. What what possibly could he do for us in this life to make us to link us to the inheritance? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 13. Who has delivered us from the power of darkness. All right. So here it is. They were these saints. He's he's saying we are partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. So the clue there is in light. What is in light? Okay. The Hebrews were the first seed of Abraham. They were the first recipients of light. What is light? The next verse tells you from the power of darkness. What is darkness? Darkness is ignorance. There it is. you. Why were you ignorant? Because you didn't know you had a father. You're an orphan. You came into this world speaking lies, doing everything unrighteous, unconscious of God. You know nothing about him. You know nothing about inheritance. So you are in ignorance. What does it mean to be enlightened? To know your father is to be in light. So why were the Hebrews the first people to be in light? Because they were the first people given the word. Right? So the prophets and the law were given to Israel. They were the first saints in light who had an inkling or an idea that there is an inheritance outstanding. So the first step here it is towards our inheritance is receiving the spoken word &gt;&gt; because what is the spoken word? It is that which gives you light. It's that which reveals your inheritance to you. Are you still following? &gt;&gt; So in the New Testament it shows that God made it possible. God made us worthy candidates through Christ. How? Through the word, right? Through Calvary, he made us meat. Though we were unworthy Gentiles. In other words, let me try and simplify this down. Right? So you have the Hebrews who for almost 1,500 years or 2,000 years since Abraham received the law, followed the law, recognized the father as God, kept the law as best they could, listened to the prophets, wrote the word down, produced the scrolls, produced the prophecies looking for the Messiah to come. They fought wars. They lived through empires. They lived through uh Babylonian Empire captivity, Meo Persian captivity, Grecian captivity, and Roman captivity at the time when Christ comes in. They suffered through it all believing that Jehovah was their father &gt;&gt; and that he was going to reveal himself to them via the Messiah and bring them their inheritance. They kept it. The word was dripping with blood. They were in light. &gt;&gt; They were the only nation on earth that was worshiping God. Amen. And then through Christ, he makes it possible that we become partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light. How? He brings us the spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So darkness means a lack of revelation or understanding, a lack of spoken word. Saints in light are those who have been enlightened. Are you listening? This is it. Sense enlight means those who have been enlightened to their inheritance and purpose. So the first thing is you receive the spirit of adoption whereby you cry aba now. So the first thing is I have the spirit of adoption. I recognize I have a father. He is God. But now I know nothing about him. I know nothing about his inheritance. How am I going to get to know him? How am I going to get to know his inheritance? Spoken word. &gt;&gt; Next step. So, first steps, spirit of adoption. Next step, spoken word. You are going to receive spoken word. Spoken word is going to be brought to you over your lifetime. You are going to receive that and that is going to put you in light. Are you with me? We are talking about the road to adoption. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to understanding. So our inheritance we come to understand is eternal. This is how we know that Abraham looked for a city whose builder and maker was God. Meaning the city is eternal. The country is eternal. It is a heavenly country. It is a heavenly city. You with us? Hebrews 9:15 says, "And for this cause he, Christ is the mediator of the New Testament, that by means of death for the redemption of the transgressions that were under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance." Rephrasing all this, Christ is the mediator of the New Testament. The testament is a will. Mediator is the executive. He's not just the executive. He is the one who dies. And the the testament only comes into the effect when the testator dies. So in other words, you can't go to your parents and say, "Listen, I want what is mine?" They're not dead yet. The will only comes into effect when they're dead. &gt;&gt; That's what it's saying. So he had to die to make the inheritance come into effect. &gt;&gt; And then he gave us the will. And the promise of eternal inheritance is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The earnest of our inheritance. &gt;&gt; The promise of our inheritance is the Holy Ghost. What does that even mean? It means when you receive the Holy Ghost is when your inheritance start to become meaningful to you. &gt;&gt; Prior to that, you got this roof that you have a father, but you got no idea what he has to offer you. You're so happy you got a father who's going to take care of you, heal your body, give you blessings and whatever. Wait till you get to know what the inheritance is &gt;&gt; because there's a responsibility that comes with that inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that tells us that this inheritance is heavenly. It is eternal inheritance. Glory to God. Because it is eternal, it is something from another dimension. Let's go to Matthew 5 and verse three. Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. So Christ came preaching there is a kingdom of heaven. And it says the poor in spirit will inherit the kingdom of heaven. It tells you there is a kingdom of heaven and the poor in spirit. This is those who are humble. So, it's telling you there's a character of people that will inherit the kingdom of heaven. Now, it doesn't stop there. It also says, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth." Oh. So, there's not just a heavenly inheritance. There's also an earthly inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These two scriptures in the message of Christ shows us the inheritance is in two parts. an inheritance that is heavenly and an inheritance that is earthly. But Paul says to us that it is eternal. It's actually telling us there's something heavenly that is eternal and there's something earthly that is eternal. &gt;&gt; Wow. There's something about earth that is eternal that will live forever. So what do we know about our inheritance so far? Number one, our inheritance is reserved for the saints, the called out ones only. Number two, the first step is receiving spoken word. First step for our inheritance, right? Number three, it's for those who have had the same faith as Abraham. Number four, it's for those who have been enlightened to it. That means those who receive the spoken word. Number five, there is a heavenly eternal inheritance. Number six, there is an earthly inheritance. Number seven, it takes the right character to inherit it. The poor in spirit and the meek. Character will inherit. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the word we're talking about the road to adoption. He's not just going to hand a son the inheritance until he comes to the fullness of adoption. You don't just adopt a baby and say, "There you go. There's my bank account. Go do with it." That child will go and buy out Toys R Us. That mind is not ready for the inheritance. &gt;&gt; You can only hand out an inheritance to someone who's come to your mind. How are we going to get this child to your mind? It has to receive the word &gt;&gt; until it's ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; So, here's another thing about this inheritance. It is incorruptible. Uh 1 Corinthians 15:50-54. Now this I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption. There this is where we start with. There is no way that you if you are corrupt will inherit incorruption. Which means something has to transform you from corruption to incorruption &gt;&gt; for you to inherit incorruption. Behold I show you a mystery. That means this is not easily understood. We shall not all sleep. That means not all of us will die. Some of us will. But we shall all be changed. That means those who die and those who are living will all be changed. So he's talking about this inheritance, right? In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump, for the trumpet shall sound, the dead shall be raised the dead. So those who died in Christ will be raised incorruptible, and we who are living shall be changed. So all of us will be changed. And what's what are we going to be changed into? This corruptible will will put on incorruption. So what is this inheritance? It's an incorruptible body. And this mortal shall put on immortality. Which means Abram, as great as he was, as wonderful as his life was serving God, was still looking for theophony. He was not in touch with it yet. And this man had seen the Messiah or rather the prefigure of Messiah. He had seen Elohim on the plains of memory. He understood there was a glorified body. So when this corruption shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, death is swallowed up in victory. That means there is coming a time. He knows Paul is saying there is coming a time when corruption will have taken on incorruption. Uh im mortality will have put on immortality and everything else. Then death is swallowed up in victory. It's saying all that is time and death and corruption is done with. It's over. Dimensions are changed. In other words, &gt;&gt; praise be to God. So this is showing us there is something incorruptible and heavenly that we must inherit. So when you were born in this life and you started on the road to adoption uh when you know when you meet a Christian in the street and they ask you are you born again and then they sell you the gospel story and they tell you if you believe in Christ uh one day there'll be a resurrection for you right and Christ died and is the only one only man who died and rose again and they tell you if you become you say the sinner's prayer you receive salv salvation. You are born again. You will receive the promise of resurrection someday, right? You you have this idea that there's something, but you don't know anything about it. I know every single person I know who came through the process of salvation, who received Christ as their savior had no idea that there was a thing called theophony. Nobody. Nobody knew anything. And even if they had heard it, they had no idea what it was. Nobody had any idea about the seventh dimension and the sixth dimension and uh uh what heaven really is about. All of us were filled with Bible stories and things our parents taught us and all the stories of the ancestors. Nobody had any clue what incorruption really is. So this is also showing us that our present earthly body cannot inherit the heavenly without a change. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There it is. &gt;&gt; You cannot attain the inheritance of the saints in light without a change. You have to be changed from glory to glory. &gt;&gt; The only way God has provided for you to receive this change is to receive spoken word. &gt;&gt; Spoken word is the original seed. Spoken word is what can speak things into existence. Spoken word is what can change your nature. Spoken word is what can make you poor in spirit and meek. Spoken word is what can make you inherit the kingdom of God and inherit the earth. This is the reason we're here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Otherwise, there's no need for church. &gt;&gt; There's no need for the Bible. There's no need for the word. There's no need for the prophets. There's no need for the messengers. It's the only reason spoken word exists because that is the way he has provided for you to inherit. &gt;&gt; Amen. So at the last trump he says the last angel's message our corruptible flesh shall be changed to incorruptible flesh by the word and our mortal spirits shall be changed to immortal. Amen. This is not speaking about a sudden flesh change like people think in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump they think it's bam Christ blits the skies. Trumpets blow, angels pour out, you know, it, you know, it's like a nice science fiction movie and then all of us fly up. You know, we lose our density. I wish a lot of people would lose their density today, but that's a hope. This is not speaking about this flesh change. It's a process of change by the word. That's the purpose of hearing the word and believing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelations 21:7. And this is what happens. This is now your next step, right? So you receive spirit of adoption that tells you who your father is. It connects you with your father. You then receive spoken word and spoken word is connecting you with your inheritance. Your inheritance that he has provided for you. Now, there's something for you to do by the spoken word that you receive, and that is to overcome. Verse 7 of Revelations 21, he that overcomemeth shall inherit all things. And I will be his God, and he shall be my son. For those of you who don't know, those last words, I will be his God, and he shall be my son. That's adoption words. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's like when Christ was there and said, "This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him." This is adoption words. I will be his God. He shall be my son. He shall inherit all things. Can you see how adoption is linked to inheritance? &gt;&gt; You can only overcome by the spoken word you have believed in. So this is saying overcoming speaks of what is overcoming he that overcometh? What is what is overcoming speaking of? Enduring with patience and coming to maturity. I'm saying it again. Overcoming is enduring the challenge of your day with patience and coming to maturity. Maturity is what's going to bring you to adoption. You're not going to give the open book to people who are just starting out. People who have were in the first stage of growth. You're not going to give the open book the title deed to the first church age. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm hearing now in the message that people say the the apostles had already had the open book. I I don't see where it is in the I can see some of you have never heard that before. But this is what so many of them are saying. The open book was already in the hands of the disciples or the apostles after Acts chapter 2. They had the open book and then what happened? They lost it because that's what they're teaching. And they had there were the bride tree and then that bride tree was stripped down by the seals and then it restarted in Luther. It's so good when you hear it. But then where do you get it from? That they were given the open book, then they lost it again, and then it went back and now it's coming back again. &gt;&gt; The way the prophet teaches it is from the beginning, Adam lost it. &gt;&gt; Man never had it. &gt;&gt; And the preparation was to bring us to it now at the end time when the bride is on earth. &gt;&gt; So I don't know where this doctrine came. It's very interesting to me that I learned now in the last few months that this is what is being preached that the the disciples the apostles had the open book and they were the original manifested sons on earth. Why manifested sons? &gt;&gt; Why? Because they had powers to heal. They were the infant church. &gt;&gt; They were the church in its infancy. They were only sent to tell the people that there is a death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. They were commissioned to go out and and give the gospel that he died and rose again. That's it. &gt;&gt; They were not preaching the seals. They were not preaching the thunders. You could call it dynamics if you want to. The dynamics they had was related to the word they had for that day. True. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And people are saying that I am preaching that Acts chapter 2 is not enough. That I am preaching that Acts chapter 2 is not the indwelling. That it was just an anointing and it's not the indwelling. They had an anoint. I already said this to you. They had the anointing and they had the indwelling of the word they had for their day. They had the indwelling of the spirit of the amount of word they had for their day. They had not even received the fullness of the word. &gt;&gt; You in this day receive the anointing and the indwelling of the whole word of God that has been expressed through 2,000 years. &gt;&gt; That's the fullness of the indwelling which they did not have. &gt;&gt; I'm not saying they had no indwelling. Every son of God had an indwelling in his day. Luther had an indwelling and an anointing. Wesley had an indwelling and an anoint indwelling of the Holy Spirit himself in them in a portion. &gt;&gt; That's congruent with everything the prophet teaches. &gt;&gt; You can overcome only by the spoken word for your day which you believe in. So if you overcome, you inherit, right? And we know in every church he says to him that overcomemeth this and this to him that overcometh this and this. So if you endured with the message for your day you inherited something which means constantly God was showing sons there is an inheritance. &gt;&gt; So far they were building up to the earthly inheritance but keeping them in touch with the heavenly. Right? So those words, I will be his God and he shall be my son, are adoption words. This makes adoption crucial for without it there can be no obtaining an inheritance. So what's the full process? Receive the word and believe and overcome by the word and receive the adoption. So I'm just going to put it out there. I'm just going to say it. If you are receiving, if you go to just any Christian church or you're receiving some kind of word, but it's not the spoken word of God, you are not being linked to your inheritance. &gt;&gt; This is it. Because the spoken word of God links you to your inheritance. &gt;&gt; You will try as you might. You will even try to conjure up thoughts and images. This is the reason why you've got thousands of Christians in the world believing in fables. So let's look at sunshine adoption part four paragraph 75. Look has predestinated un us unto this inheritance. If I'm a right inheritance of something, if God is knocking at my heart and saying, William Brandham, I called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel. I have an inheritance, an inheritance of eternal life. Now, God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me. Right? God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me. Amen. Because there was nothing I could do to inherit it. &gt;&gt; I was an orphan. &gt;&gt; It was blank. It was in It was valid. There's nothing I can do. But in the fullness of time, God sent in his own good time, Jesus, the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. His blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance. Now, here it is. To be what? What inheritance? to sunship &gt;&gt; to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Now what was becoming sons about? Remember last week becoming sons was about receiving theophony. Theophony is theophony is the heavenly inheritance. Theophony is actually the son of god. Right now you see theophony does not need adoption because theophony knows its father. &gt;&gt; What needs adoption is this body. &gt;&gt; Because this body does not have a link to its father. &gt;&gt; The only link there is is the attribute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this body needs the spirit of adoption to come to the same understanding as the theophony. that theophony is the son of God. &gt;&gt; This is the son of man, &gt;&gt; right? The son of Charles and Elabbrand, the son of uh Steven and Jennifer Francis, the son of the Francises. This is this body. &gt;&gt; But then someday you come to an understanding. I am not the son of so and so. I am the son of God. How do you come to that understanding? You're coming to the same understanding of that theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that theophony is the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what becoming sons means. So your inheritance, this body's inheritance, this what this body is looking to is to become a son. Amen. Becoming sons is about the offenes. So this one word speaks of everything we have been speaking about, right? But the first part of our inheritance is sunship. That's the first part of our inheritance. So now here's the thing. Adam inherited the earth, right? &gt;&gt; What made Adam go of the earth? The theophony. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So you cannot even inherit the earth first without getting the theophony. &gt;&gt; So without getting the heavenly inheritance, you cannot inherit the earthly inheritance. Let me put it to you personally. You cannot have the eternal fleshly body for each one of you personally unless you first inherit the theophony. &gt;&gt; Because it's the theophony that's going to make the flesh eternal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Understood? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what you are looking for permanently. &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham was searching for. a city whose which had foundations whose builder and maker was God. Because if he obtained theophony, he would live forever in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Though he had obtained Israel, he was still looking for a city whose builder and maker was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is becoming sons connects you with your theophony, your heavenly inheritance which then gives you the earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the title deed. &gt;&gt; Do you see it? So this is not about seeing Jesus as God. The first thing we inherit is sunship of Christ. We see the sunship of Christ through belief in the revelation of Christ as God. And that's not saying, "Ah, okay. So Jesus is God. Prove it to me." And then we go through this whole, you know, godship uh doctrine and prove this by that scripture and that. To me, that's exhausting to have to to have to go through some to prove to you by scriptures and what this one says and how this one is better than that one and how brother says this better than Billy Graham or how brother says this better than I got no time for that. What? Like what's preventing you from seeing that Christ is is God? What do you need? Christ himself said, "I've been here so long. You you do not know that I am the father. The father I am in the father, the father in me, and we are one. Have I been with you so long and you're still asking to see the father?" &gt;&gt; What do you need to know? What do you need to satisfy that immature little puny childish brain of yours that requires logic and reasoning and proof and and all the links and sources you can get from the internet to prove that Christ is God? &gt;&gt; This is not about seeing Jesus as God. This this is the belief that we have by faith. &gt;&gt; The mystery revealed in Christ. Okay. Are you are you with me? I'm going to say this once. If you're not going to get it now, you're never going to get it ever. Pack up and leave. &gt;&gt; Right? What is the mystery of Christ? What is Jesus Christ? What does he mean by if you've seen me, you've seen the father? What does it mean to you personally? Only one thing. Jesus Christ is proof that man can be God. &gt;&gt; That's the most meaningful thing to you. &gt;&gt; Everything else is Christian theology. &gt;&gt; What manner of man is this that the wind and the seas obey him? &gt;&gt; What manner of man is this that he raised Lazarus from the dead? What manner of man is this that he could allow himself to be taken and scourged and put on the cross to die and then rise again? What manner of man is this to forgive sins? What manner of man is this to descent to hell and release one dimension and take them up into another? &gt;&gt; This is the revelation that man can be God. &gt;&gt; What is this all about? The story of God and man. &gt;&gt; That God could become man and man could become God. Jesus Christ is the manifestation that man can be God. &gt;&gt; That's the only meaningful thing to you. Nothing else. &gt;&gt; That's not going to be proven to you by words of William Brandham or words of Billy Graham or whichever other ham you can find. Right? There's not not any other person. If you didn't get this by the Bible and the message already, you've missed the point. Because that's what you're being connected to. &gt;&gt; You're being connected to knowing that one day you can be like Christ. &gt;&gt; And what are you saying then? See that man can be God. &gt;&gt; That's what almost all Christians miss. That's what the Jews accused Christ of. What do they say? You being a man, &gt;&gt; make yourself God. &gt;&gt; That's the reason they crucified him. &gt;&gt; Called him bilab said he was blaspheing. That was the entire purpose and the revelation of God in Christ is that man can be God. Man can declare the father. Man can manifest the fountain of life. Man can display the fountain of seven colors. Man can display the everlasting Elam. Man can display Elohim. Man can display Yahweh, Jehovah, the self-existing one. &gt;&gt; This is proof. Christ is proof that this is possible. &gt;&gt; And he came to tell you that you were that originally and sin came in by your own choice. But there's a way for you to get back there. That's Christianity. &gt;&gt; Not this nonsense we make today with churches and denominations and this name and that name and everyone's leading you someplace to to to where some man gave you an idea of what you are what you're going to be or what you have to do. And usually it amounts to paying an X amount of money to the church for the rest of your life with a promise of something because if you don't it's going to, you know, it's going to be detrimental to your place in heaven. That's what all men do. We know that story. It's it's recorded through history. Men are going to dupe you. Men are going to take away your free will. &gt;&gt; They're going to use religion and power and and uh and and fear and scare you about hell and demons and witchcraft and and and all kinds of terrifying things and why you need God and you need prayer and you need oil and you need holy water and you need saints and you need Mary and you need whole of people to go through or else you're dead meat. Yeah. What kind of God is that? One who walks around in eggshells in fear half his life. Crossing yourself, sprinkling, using liquids, all kinds of weird things, and blessed this and blessed cloth and blessed clothing and blessed stuff and blessed stick and blessed Bible and all of that. You're just a person still under the spirit of bondage. You haven't even seen father yet. &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, if you seen father, you break out of your house with your chest standing out. &gt;&gt; You you you break out of this life saying what can separate me from the love of God? &gt;&gt; No danger, peril, sword, no nothing, no disease, no death, no nothing can separate me. That's your experience when you are connected to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I want to show you. So, so what's our inheritance? Sunship, theophony, heavenly inheritance. Abraham was not linked to it yet because Messiah had not come. They all did such great things but they they did not receive it because Messiah had not yet come because father had not been revealed to them yet. &gt;&gt; Right? Now sunship has been made known. Theophony is in sight. Right now all those from Abraham's day all the way up to Christ, they died and went into the fifth dimension, Abraham's bosom. They were not yet sixth dimension. They did not attain heavenly status. Only after Christ was the way paved to sunship to attain theophony. Now what is a son? &gt;&gt; How many of you think you know what a sun is? H a son is not somebody who just plays before the father. A son is not somebody who uh has to be given something and the father must pet him on the head and tell him good boy, good boy. Well done. That's a dog. That's not a son. This is a son. God who had sun at times in diverse manners spake in times past by the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son. First point who is a son who the father can speak through. &gt;&gt; What are we doing now? I'm defining what sunship is. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; I'm I'm defining to you what a son is. Who is a son? One who God can speak by. who when he speaks it's God speaking. &gt;&gt; I am he. &gt;&gt; Right. First point number two. Whom he hath appointed heir of all things. A son is the inheritor of everything that is the fathers. He owns heavens and earth. It's his time dimensions. All belongs to him. He inherits all things. Number three, who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person. This is that theophony, the brightness of his glory, right? He in verse three it says he was the enlightening. What is the brightness of his glory? The revelation of who he is. &gt;&gt; A son is the revelation of who God is. &gt;&gt; A son is a revelation of who the father is. He's the enlightening brightness enlightening. He removes the darkness. That means Christians who claim to be sons of God must be people manifesting the father, &gt;&gt; the nature of the father. People who claim to be sons of God must walk in truth. They must speak light. They must not cause confusion. &gt;&gt; They cannot speak with a double tongue. Right? uh and upholding all things by the power of his by the word of his power. Upholding is overcoming. Overcoming by what? Spoken word. &gt;&gt; That's a son. He overcomes the challenges of this life by spoken word. And not just spoken word that he heard by the word of his power. Amen. He was able to. So this is what Christ did. He expressed who the father is. He was the brightness of his glory. He was the revelation of the father. He was he spoke. When he spoke, it was God speaking. He was the inheritor of all things. This answers the question why the wind and the seas obey him. Why death could not overcome him? Why he could raise Lazarus from the from the from the dead? It answers all the questions, right? when he had by himself purged our sins, which means he's an intercessor for others, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high. Sat down on the right hand of the majesty. That means a son is equal to his father. Sat down on the right hand means he handles his father's business. Amen. I love the rest of it. The rest of it is just phenomenal because it brings us back to our story of God and man, which is being made so much better than the angels. &gt;&gt; Who was made better than the angels? Not the body of Jesus Christ born of a virgin. King Theophony. Theophony is better than the angels, &gt;&gt; right? And by and as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name &gt;&gt; than they that's telling you theophony is a more excellent name than angels. &gt;&gt; Theophony is a more excellent existence than angels. &gt;&gt; Right? Verse 5 tells you that angels are not sons. For unto which of the angels said he at any time thou art my son? Angels are not sons. &gt;&gt; They are angels. &gt;&gt; Sons are sons. The scriptures is saying it's implying that not one of the angels did he speak to and say thou art my son. That's what Lucifer desired. Lucifer desired sunship. It was a worthy desire. He was just not made for it. He was not born for it. Again, I will be to him a father and he shall be to me a son. Saints, that is what sunship is. That is what your inheritance is. You know, you can't be shy about this. So, what is sunship? From Hebrews 1:1-5, one who God can speak by. Number two, he's appointed heir of all things. Number three, he is the mystery of God revealed the brightness of his glory, the express image of his person. Number four, he overcomes all things by faith in the spoken word, upholding all things by the word of his power. Number five, adopted to take the place of God, sitting on the right hand of God. Adoption to take the place. So after he had overcome, he uh ascended and was adopted. That's full adoption taking the place of God. Number six, King Theophony. He exists higher than sixth dimension. He has got a name greater than the angels. Number seven, he overcame in flesh on earth and inherited all things. Praise be to God. So saints, we have not yet the bodies. That's what we read in MelkiseDC. We'll read again. And then you see him come right down uh the regular line from attribute before the foundation of the world his name is put in the lamb's book of life. Then from that he become the word the theophony that could appear disappear and then he become flesh and returned back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition. But you bypass the theophony and become flesh man to be tempted by sin. And then if this earthly tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting. What? theophony. &gt;&gt; We have not yet the bodies. So we have not been fully connected or fully joined or fully married to the bodies. &gt;&gt; We have obtained a spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba. &gt;&gt; Right? But that theophony knows abba. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we are coming to that understanding that theophony has right now. You are an orphan receiving the promise of full adoption through the earnest. The Holy Ghost gives you the promise of adoption, the spirit of adoption whereby you who are born of your parents in the darkness of this world can cry aba. That means you can deny your birth where you can remember in the beginning I told you it's illogical. It's unreasonable. There's no logical reason why you had no father. If if we take away the message of the hour today from off the face of the earth, if we take away Christianity, do you know what happens to this world? It's dead in a few seconds. Only the morality of God's word is holding this this world alive. &gt;&gt; There there isn't a single religion or philosophy that has the power to keep all those nukes in the ground. &gt;&gt; Not one. Not even Buddhism. &gt;&gt; Nobody is using Buddhism to break to broke a peace in the in the in the world. Nobody's using Buddhism to broke a peace between Ukraine and Russia or Israel and Palestine. Nobody. Nobody ever says you're a Buddhist. You're supposed to do this. All of them say you're a Christian. &gt;&gt; You're supposed to do this. You They hold you accountable to Christianity. Nobody goes around saying you're a Muslim, you're supposed to do this. You're a Hindu, you're supposed to do this. Nobody cares about that. Nobody holds any other religion accountable except Christianity. Why? Because that is the one that speaks of the morals that hold society safe. &gt;&gt; You Africans on this continent, you'd be going back to tribalism and killing each other for speaking a different language in 5 seconds. This is the truth. We did it in India. In India, this is what happened. We had the high cost and low cost and we abused they they abused the low cost. It's been for thousands of years. If you're a certain uh uh surname, you're a low cost. You can only be a servant. You can never rise from servant status to anything. If you are from the raja, well, you're a Brahman. If you're from that status, that's what you're lucky. You're born into that. You can be an absolutely filthy horror drug dealer and still you'll be greater than all the peasants in India. &gt;&gt; You can never rise to anything. So what do those Indians do? They leave India and go to the west where they can become something. &gt;&gt; They come to Africa where they can become something because in India they can never rise above the status. So do you here in Africa, you have to go to where Christian principles are taught to escape your tribal order, where you can rise from what your fathers holding you down here in Africa and you can go to American Canada and become something. &gt;&gt; You cannot do that in any other religion you come from &gt;&gt; or culture or race. Without Christianity, you'd be killing each other all over again. &gt;&gt; That is the truth. I know where I come from. I know my ancestry. I know the religions where my families came from. I know what they teach. My religion, my ancestry is the most racist ancestry in the world. I laugh at all these Americans, you know, who who uh put Indians into their parliament, their their Senate. And those Indians, I hear them on the news, you know, they're all talking about equality. Indians are the most racist people on earth. They hate blacks and whites equally. All those Indians laughing, they know what I'm talking about. We got special names for every one of you who are not our race. Bad names. So I hear these fellas all the they're they're running for Congress. They're Indians. And those on the Democratic side, they talk about equality. They're all liars. They hate every other race. They see every other race as beneath them. It's part of our Indian culture. Yeah. Black people smell bad. White people smell bad. They know. They all know. All of them laughing. They know because that's what you're taught. They're full of nonsense. Is why people don't have a bath regularly. We bought three times a day. The most racist people. So don't tell me you are going to save the world with your culture. &gt;&gt; If you can't even see what removes that from us is only the word of God. &gt;&gt; For me to put my arms around my brothers, black and white, Chinese, whatever, and say to you are my brother. We are one. Only one thing can do that and that's the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Nothing else because it's bred into you to hate everyone else. &gt;&gt; And don't tell me it's a religion of peace. It's a culture of peace. It isn't. It's a lie. They executed Mahatma Gandhi. They executed every other leader. They did all that. And you here in Africa are no different. &gt;&gt; Muslims are no different. Yeah. Muhammad dies and uh comes up with this idea there must be a khalif. You don't know about the caliphate. There must be a khalif. So the first khalif they get is from Egypt. But now the Saudi Arabians are unhappy with an Egyptian calip. The Iranians are unhappy with an Egyptian calip. The Turkish. Right now the Muslims will never elect a califf in the place of Muhammad because the moment he's from Saudi Arabia, the Arab the Iranians will bomb them. And God forbid they they elect a Palestinian califf. They're all fighting for each other because they're against Israel and they're against Christians. But where must they get a califf from? It's like here in South Africa. Will the Sutu people accept a Zulu king over South Africa? Never. Will the Zulu people accept a petty king over South Africa? Never. They'll die first. Probably the most peaceful and loving uh Africans on earth are the Zimbabweans and they too will turn savage. They are the most peaceful. Our friendliest people on the planet are Zimbabweans. I've traveled I can tell you to the most loving people and they'll turn savage because if you put an guy as king over all of Zimbabwe, &gt;&gt; you have trouble my friend. They'll turn from those hospitable, loving people into absolute savages. Their fangs will come out. This is why you have not yet the bodies. &gt;&gt; You see, I'm the only one who will tell you the truth. [laughter] Everyone else is afraid to say it, but you know what I'm talking about. What we are lacking then there are heavenly theophony bodies. Becoming sons is about this body. It's about the spirit and the soul in this earthly form overcoming sin and death by believing in the spoken word with pure faith unto full salvation and redemption. Then we're we're not be we will not be able to inherit theophanies unless our natures here match the character of theophony. For there to be a marriage, for there to be oneness, this flesh has to receive the character that matches the theophony. So you have to become sons in this body by spoken word by overcoming by spoken word &gt;&gt; and then the two become one and then you've inherited heaven. Amen. And then heaven gives you the right to inherit eternal earth. Glory to God. So my part in the inheritance a little further now that 11 ver uh 11th verse in whom also we have obtained an inheritance uh or an inheritance. Somebody has to leave you something to inherit it. Right? Is that right? An inheritance. What inheritance do we have? What inheritance did I have? I didn't have any. But God left me an inheritance when he put my name in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. So I didn't have any. He had to the name was an attribute that was that came from the fountain of life and found a body and predestinated this body to that inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Adoption has always been about inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. He left me an inheritance when he wrote the mystery, the name, the mystery of my true character in the lamb's book of life. That attribute found me. That attribute has the ability in it to bring me to the character of that theophony. Glory to God. This shows the need for the book coming down, right? For being revealed. It contains the revelation. So when the book is open, I see my name in there. What do I It's personal sense. I see what I'm supposed to be in Christ, right? It reveals the revelation whether I'm a part of that inheritance or not. Of believing the word of salvation and receiving power to become sons is only faith toward becoming sons. But receiving the open book is receiving the proof of my sunship. Right? The title lead of redemption the beginning of my adoption. This is the day of full adoption. &gt;&gt; Amen. When I received the new birth, I received the spirit of adoption whereby I cry aba. I received the baptism of the holy ghost which is the earnest of my adoption. &gt;&gt; Right? It is receiving the spirit of sunship. But receiving the open book is the proof of my sunship. The title deed, this is the name I and only I, you and only you can hear concerning me and you under the ministry of the seven thunders. &gt;&gt; That's the beautiful part of this last time. If you remember 1 Peter 1 2:7 where we spoke about, remember we read it last week, there's inheritance, incorruptible, undefiled, reserved in the heaven for you. Remember that, right? The scriptures say we are begotten again, born again for this purpose, receiving an incorruptible inheritance, undefiled, meant having no age, only to be revealed in the last days. That itself shows us the revelation of what the last days is about. That this would that the preaching of the word what it should achieve in the last days. And then it says who are kept showing that it's a person. &gt;&gt; It's a body. Amen. All right. So, let's close this down. Who's this MelkiseDC? Then after you recognize the very word of God was eagle food, then you left eagle food. Eagle food is speaking of food that pertains to sons. You understand? Don't don't pass over that without grabbing the the value, the nugget after you recognize the very word of God was eagle food. What's he referring to eagle food? He's referring to that story he told you about the the eagle in the barnyard &gt;&gt; who was lost in a place where he didn't know who he was. He was an orphan. His mother was a chicken and he's he's got his big wings and this ability and he's flopping around in a chicken yard and he doesn't know he's an eagle. And then one day he hears a scream of an eagle and something inside opens &gt;&gt; and he looks up and he sees something there that looks like him. &gt;&gt; That's what it means. When you recognize the very word of God was eagle food. It has to do with identity. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it has to do with sunship. &gt;&gt; Then you left the other thing. &gt;&gt; Then you left the other thing. You have been formed into the living image of the living God. You heard from your theophony. &gt;&gt; That is from your theophony. The eagle scream, the eagle food. See, then you heard. Then he says, if this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting. &gt;&gt; Do you love him? If you are starting to manifest the word, you are expressing the image of his person as Christ did. Hebrews chapter 1, you become sons. Once you have grabbed onto this, you know what you are learning right now and some of us very slowly. You have to speak for God. &gt;&gt; You have to be the brightness of his person, &gt;&gt; the image of his person. And uh it's it's going to get very bad before it gets to where it's supposed to be &gt;&gt; because this flesh, let's not downplay how stubborn this flesh is, right? This is the reason why it's taking this long because it is so set in its ways, so stubborn. So uh the the this this first nature is to sin. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So this first nature is to rebel against the word. &gt;&gt; So this is the reason it's taking so long because to accept sunship and inheritance of God is a fight. So it means that you have been appointed heir of all things as Christ was. You have obtained a better name than the angels. Do you believe that? That's what is revealed to you when the book is revealed. When the seventh seal is open and you see your name there, you see that you have a better name than the angels. &gt;&gt; I could spend days speaking just about that. Hearing from your theophony is hearing that better name than the angels. It is hearing your name like in the type when Christ called Mary Magdalene's name at the tomb and she instantly knew who he was. To us, it is the recognition of our new character. Okay, let's go to the invisible union. I love this quote. Your name of your first nature was born and put in a book of life. All your deeds, your first nature was this one. All your deeds was wrote then to everything you done under the nature was in a book called the book of life. Now you you were separated from the womb uh you separated from that union by spiritual death that is accepting Christ as your personal savior. So the first nature this character that I was born with the sinful character by accepting Christ I'm separated. I died to myself. I'm separated from that original nature, but it's still there, right? I'm I'm I'm battling it out. Your natural desire is to cut your hair. Your natural desire is to wear shorts, paint your face. See what I'm saying? Your natural desire is to be intellectual, smart man, know something better than the other. That's what Eve wanted. That's the very thing she wanted. Well, you separated from your first union by spiritual death. Now you are born again or remarried again to the new spirit. So in other words, that's when the attribute becomes meaningful. The attribute that was in the fountain of life becomes alive. Now you are you got these two natures in you. The other one which was not revealed to you, you was still in darkness. Now it's become light. Now you you're battling with these two inside you. Right? Well, one says you're a son of God. The other one says, "Oh, come on, man. Have some fun." Right? Now you are born again, remarried again. Not your natural life or things of the world, but of eternal life. That germ that was in you at the beginning found you. Now your old book is gone with your old union. Now your name in your old has been transferred. Now you say, "Do you mean to tell me that my old book God put in a se of his forgetfulness, you stand perfectly before God?" the in um paragraph 24. Now your name is now in the new book, not the book of life, but the lamb's book of life. What the lamb redeemed. This is what sunship is about, right? Bringing more sons like unto himself. Not the old book of your natural union, but your new bride. Hallelujah. Your new life is in the lamb's book of life. Your marriage certificate. Hallelujah. Where your true eternal germ from the beginning takes hold. In the last two services we showed you this what that germ is how it comes to life. Do you agree? Do you believe it? All this looks like to me it's almost become like like message buzzwords now your marriage certificate your lamb's book of life your eternal germ that that germ found you and all that. It's like they preach it so much as buzzwords people don't understand the reality of it anymore. Right now you're only forgiven but you're justified. Glory justified. Romans 5:1 said therefore being justified by faith. So that is the new name that we hear under the thunders. That's why the message is different because when the message is revealed to you, it reveals to you way beyond what Christianity gives. Because Christianity only introduces you to father. The message hooks you into inheritance. &gt;&gt; If you uh received every messenger in the church ages, it hooked you into inheritance. &gt;&gt; It put you into sunship. The other one was just recognizing father. So all Christians in the world just recognize father and don't take the road to to adoption. you know, I I listen to some of them. I like to listen to them uh because I like to hear whether there's progression. And uh I hear them, the denominational preachers, and they're they're like, you know, uh we are all sinners. I'm a sinner. You're a sinner. We're all sinners. You know, every one of us is not perfect. Every one of And it sounds it sounds good. It sounds like we're making everyone the same. It sounds like we're making uh we're being inclusive. There's that word, right? Everyone, we're inclusive. Everyone's everyone's dirty. That makes us all bad and all of us need Jesus. But that's a saying, you know, we recognize Jesus and we recognize father, but we're all stuck here. So every day we basically come to church just to keep repenting. We just we need church and worship and we need the word just so we can keep repenting. But we like we don't want to become sons. We don't want to take over the inheritance. We we're too afraid of the responsibility. We don't want to speak for him. We don't want to manifest him. We just want what he has to give us for now. We want gifts. How was your sunship given to you? By predestination. How is it? How was our inheritance given to us? Through what? Predestination. Predestination is fornowledge. That how did God know he could trust you to be a preacher? His fornowledge. Not he that willth or runth. It's God that showeth mercy. That's right. Predestination. He knew what was in you. He know what was in you before you come to the earth. There's our story of God and man. He know what was in you before there was ever a earth for you to come on. That's him. That's the infinite God. The infinite. We're finite. We can only think finite saints. Predestination by fornowledge. We're closing. Sunship was given to us to the elect by predestination. That was his plan for you. that you that had to be revealed to you. You have no way of working that out yourself. Do you agree? &gt;&gt; Right. God could see by fornowledge what character you were supposed to have. You would never have known. You don't even know what what to do tomorrow. So he he predestinated you for a purpose and led you while you were not aware that he was leading you to an earth an earthly uh inheritance that could lead us to that sunship and make sure that we actually get it. Are you with us? By fornowledge, he could make the prophet a preacher or you a teacher or a mechanic or uh like a uh a carpenter or something or the other. He could make you into something, right? They were all uh uh by fornowledge he could make you into something. He could put into you an attribute that could lead you to become something you would never have thought could even lead you to a place where there is an earthly vocation for you like an like an earthly uh career or an earthly uh position in life that would be suitable to the purpose of a son of God. Is that right? You know because of that attribute within you, you're not going to choose something to be in this life that will contradict sunship. This is why there's such a a pressure on us as as people to not become something that will contradict God's word. Amen. And Abraham was looking for a city whose builder and maker was God according to Hebrews 11. Is that right? And they were all looking for something earthy because there was some earthly reward. And yet they all realized though they had attained Abraham received Isaac but was not satisfied. He received that promise but he realized there was something heavenly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; David uh received the throne and then said but I want to build you a house. &gt;&gt; There's something more. Solomon did it and then there's something more and every time they had achieved their purpose on earth they degenerated into something and lost their testimonies became something else and got into idolatry and there was something more they were looking to and did not attain. Our inheritance in heaven is our theophanes and that gives us our sunship. Sunship is our heavenly relationship to God and the father is ah as his sons that entitles us to our earthly inheritance. Amen. So putting it plainly, your earthly inheritance one day is a glorified body, &gt;&gt; a body that will live on earth for eternity. &gt;&gt; But you cannot get that without becoming sun first. Amen. &gt;&gt; You cannot get that without receiving adoption because you can only take over the earthly inheritance if you have the title deed. &gt;&gt; To get the title deed, you have to become a son. To become a son, you need the spirit of adoption. You need spoken word. You need to overcome this by spoken word. Then you receive adoption. That's receiving full sunship. That's receiving earthly inheritance. That's the road to adoption. &gt;&gt; That's what that's why we are here. Look at where we are in that plan. Christ came 2,000 years ago. The baptism of the Holy Ghost came 2,000 years ago. Where are we right now? We are so far ahead, so far along. We are right here at the end where adoption is at the brink. &gt;&gt; We are at the time where the rapture is promised. We are at the time where theophanes have to be revealed to each son of God. Where all those that were dead shall be changed and those that are living shall be changed. For what purpose? Once we have all fully received sunship, it is time to take the earthly inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then what happens when we receive sunship while we're at the marriage supper? Our earthly inheritance is taken away from the enemy who has been squatting on it for a long time. and it is purged for our purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in closing, rejoice and be exceeding glad. That is rapture. [clears throat] For what reason? For great is your reward in heaven. For so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Great is your reward in heaven. This is more than just a fantasy. It's more than just a story of one day I'll make it to heaven because I accepted Christ. Your reward in heaven, your adoption, your sunship, who you are, your name revealed, the right to life, the right to the earth. Great is your reward in heaven. Rejoice and be exceeding glad. This is the time for rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads together.
