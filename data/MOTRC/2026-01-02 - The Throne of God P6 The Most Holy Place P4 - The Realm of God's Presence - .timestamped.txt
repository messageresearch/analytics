[0:00] I greet you brothers and sisters in the
[0:02] wonderful and precious name of our Lord
[0:05] and Savior Jesus Christ. It's great to
[0:08] be sharing the word of the Lord with you
[0:10] once again
[0:12] and um we're getting into the throne of
[0:15] God part six in this teaching
[0:18] uh and the most holy place part four and
[0:21] for a title the realm of God's presence.
[0:26] This should be the last segment we will
[0:28] do on the most holy place. Believe me,
[0:30] there's so much more we could talk
[0:33] about. Go through the scriptures, go
[0:35] through all the
[0:37] uh types and shadows in the book of
[0:40] Leviticus and Exodus and and talk more
[0:44] about the different happenings in the
[0:46] Bible concerning the most holy place.
[0:49] But I believe you know all these things
[0:51] and I don't want to exhaust the thought.
[0:54] I want to get to us the simplicity of it
[0:59] so that the Holy Spirit can build in you
[1:03] uh more and more understanding on the
[1:05] subject if you will. I would like to put
[1:08] the skeleton into place and allow the
[1:11] Holy Spirit to put flesh on the bones so
[1:14] to speak. So let's read our scripture
[1:18] which is Hebrews chapter 9 and verse
[1:20] 2-4.
[1:23] For there was a tabernacle made, the
[1:26] first, wherein was the candlestick, and
[1:29] the table, and the showbread, which is
[1:31] called the sanctuary. And after the
[1:34] second veil, the tabernacle, which is
[1:36] called the holiest of all, which had the
[1:39] golden sensor, and the ark of the
[1:41] covenant overlaid roundabout with gold,
[1:45] wherein was the golden pot that had
[1:47] mana, and Aaron's rod that budded, and
[1:52] the tables of the covenant.
[1:55] So just to bring a little
[1:59] um revision the three realms of the
[2:03] tabernacle we want to introduce that we
[2:06] know there's the outer court the inner
[2:08] court and the most holy place or the
[2:10] outer court the holy place and the most
[2:14] holy place they had different names but
[2:17] I want to
[2:19] uh define something for us so that we
[2:23] could understand and the functions of
[2:26] these courts or rooms.
[2:30] So number one, the outer court which we
[2:32] will get to in the last part of this
[2:34] teaching these teachings or of the
[2:37] series. The outer court is the realm of
[2:41] sacrifice. We're going to look into that
[2:44] much later. The inner court is the realm
[2:47] of worship. So your outer court, which
[2:50] is your body, is the realm of sacrifice.
[2:53] The inner court which is your spirit is
[2:56] the realm of worship. But the most holy
[2:59] place, the holiest of all, the holiest
[3:02] of holies, that is the realm of God's
[3:06] presence. And that's our title, the
[3:09] realm of God's presence.
[3:12] To start with, I want to make this clear
[3:14] that Paul is the one speaking here in
[3:16] the book of Hebrews. And he makes a
[3:18] statement that there are two veils in
[3:21] that in verse three he says after the
[3:24] second veil the tabernacle. So after the
[3:27] second veil implies that there are two
[3:29] veils. Now this is not often talked of
[3:32] probably because it was taken for
[3:33] granted that everybody understands that.
[3:37] Now in the tabernacle of Moses there was
[3:39] a light curtain veil at the opening of
[3:42] the inner court. That was the first
[3:45] veil. The second veil was the heavy veil
[3:48] that separated the holy place from the
[3:50] most holy place. So also in the
[3:53] tabernacle of our bodies, there is a
[3:56] veil between the body realm and the
[3:58] spirit realm. We are used to calling it
[4:01] the flesh veil or the veil of the flesh.
[4:04] For example, we often say that people
[4:06] could not see God behind the veil of
[4:08] Christ's flesh.
[4:10] So the the first veil refers to the uh
[4:16] outward appearance of a person. Now why
[4:20] is that a veil? Why is the appearance of
[4:23] a person a veil?
[4:25] Now remember it's not the physical skin
[4:28] on the outside that is veiling something
[4:32] moving inside.
[4:34] It's a spiritual thing. The veil is a
[4:36] spiritual thing. Now because the
[4:38] appearance of a person does not reflect
[4:41] the true person inside therefore it is
[4:45] available. The appearance of a person is
[4:46] subject to the interpretation of others.
[4:48] So if people look at you on the outside
[4:51] and you know you can study those things
[4:53] in psychology and people think that
[4:58] uh um these are studies from psychology.
[5:00] These are stereotypes that people have
[5:02] that that a a fat person is generally
[5:06] not as intelligent or a person with not
[5:10] much of a chin is not really
[5:12] intelligent. Uh you know so there's and
[5:16] and yet that perception is totally
[5:18] false.
[5:20] Um but there are many many things that
[5:23] people look at in on the body realm and
[5:26] make decisions on and that is exactly
[5:29] the problem is that the appearance on
[5:32] the outside is the actual veil. So also
[5:35] for the individual the body realm and
[5:39] its five senses. So for you yourself
[5:43] your body realm and your five senses
[5:45] does not really comprehend the spirit
[5:47] realm. I mean, how much how many of you
[5:52] um actually know and can define who you
[5:56] are because you understand your spirit
[5:59] so well.
[6:01] Most of us define ourselves by the
[6:04] things that we do, by the foods we like
[6:07] to eat, which is what we do on the body
[6:09] realm, by the clothes we like to wear,
[6:11] by the person we see in the mirror.
[6:14] And we tend to define our lives and who
[6:17] we are. What we see in the mirror
[6:20] affects us. Either we're happy one day
[6:22] with what we see or we're depressed
[6:24] about what we see depending on what
[6:26] phase of life we're in. So even to
[6:30] ourselves, our own flesh is a veil. We
[6:34] sometimes forget who we are on the
[6:36] inside because the outside does not
[6:39] really comprehend the inside person.
[6:44] So however your spirit realm totally
[6:48] understands the signal the body gives it
[6:50] and makes decisions for the body realm.
[6:53] But the body cannot make decisions for
[6:55] the spirit realm, your own spirit realm.
[6:59] Now we are discussing the most holy
[7:01] place and calling it the realm of God's
[7:04] presence because in our sinful existence
[7:08] it is the only true place that the
[7:10] presence of God could be and could be
[7:12] effective. What I'm saying to you is
[7:16] no matter what emotions you feel,
[7:18] whether you're in church or in your
[7:19] closet praying or whatever it is, the
[7:23] spirit of God or the realm of God's
[7:25] presence
[7:27] is not in the body or the spirit. It can
[7:30] only be in the soul realm. The reason
[7:33] for making this distinction is that many
[7:36] people see other people speak with
[7:38] tongues, prophesy, and do healing
[7:41] campaigns and and they mistake that for
[7:44] the presence of God. It is not.
[7:48] Those things are the effects on the body
[7:51] realm or the anointing of the presence
[7:54] that exists elsewhere.
[7:57] The time has come for the presence of
[7:59] God to be seen in the entire tabernacle.
[8:02] But while there is still sin on earth,
[8:05] it is very difficult, as you will agree,
[8:08] to definitively say whether someone
[8:12] doing signs and wonders has the presence
[8:15] of God in him or not, or to say whether
[8:19] the person is a true believer or not.
[8:21] And you know, in brother Vanam's own
[8:22] life, he saw two brothers speaking with
[8:26] tongues and prophesying and the
[8:28] prophecies in tongues were accurate as
[8:30] anything. But when he shook their hands,
[8:34] he realized one was a saint and one was
[8:36] not.
[8:38] So as long as those veils exist, the
[8:42] first and second veil, the realm of
[8:45] God's presence will always and only be
[8:48] the most holy place or the soul of man.
[8:51] So what I'm saying to you is it doesn't
[8:54] matter what you feel like in the
[8:56] presence of God. how you shout, how you
[8:58] scream, what visions you might see in
[9:02] what dreams you might have in your mind.
[9:04] None of those things are an indication
[9:08] of the presence of God or the realm of
[9:11] God's presence. You can never claim that
[9:13] the that God lives in in that those
[9:16] realms of your being. It does not.
[9:19] Right? So according to the the pattern
[9:24] of what God did here in the tabernacle,
[9:27] the realm of God's presence is the most
[9:29] holy place and the most holy place only.
[9:35] So let's talk about the realm of God's
[9:37] presence. So we have been dealing with
[9:39] the most holy place, the realm of God's
[9:41] presence. In where was notice what was
[9:44] inside this little room was the ark of
[9:46] the covenant in which was the law of God
[9:50] and above the mercy seat upon which the
[9:52] pillar of fire would descend.
[9:54] Right? So you you read that we read that
[9:57] in Hebrews chapter
[10:00] uh chapter 9 verse verse um 2 to 4. we
[10:03] saw uh Paul identifying what was behind
[10:07] the veil. Now you can see what Paul does
[10:10] is he he adds on. Now if we read Exodus,
[10:14] we only see the ark
[10:16] uh inside the veil or within the veil.
[10:20] But later on on the road to the promised
[10:22] land, two more things were added to the
[10:25] most holy place. two significant things
[10:27] happened to prove the power of the
[10:30] presence of the Lord to show that God's
[10:32] choice of the ministry was the only
[10:35] legitimate one. So we want to study
[10:38] specific attributes about the presence
[10:40] of God and what it does when it is
[10:42] there. I think that the presence of God
[10:45] is severely misunderstood which is why
[10:47] many people get so discouraged and
[10:49] despondent when things don't go
[10:52] according to their expectations of God.
[10:56] Because of what so-called expert
[10:58] theologians and anointed preachers have
[11:00] told us, we assume that when the
[11:02] presence of God is felt, miraculous
[11:05] things have to happen because well, if
[11:08] it doesn't happen, then it's not God.
[11:10] Now, I've heard many preachers talking
[11:13] about there needs to be a spiritual
[11:15] something uh you know, there needs to be
[11:17] some prophecy, some speaking with
[11:19] tongues, something happening otherwise
[11:21] you don't know. Now, that is just
[11:23] incorrect. Okay. The signs and the
[11:26] wonders were for a specific season and
[11:28] also if they take place now they are for
[11:31] a specific reason and that is to attract
[11:34] people who don't have the revelation of
[11:36] the word right now. That's the primary
[11:41] reason for signs and wonders. Read the
[11:43] scriptures. It'll tell you the same
[11:44] thing. So we want to dispel all these
[11:47] false beliefs and have true realistic
[11:50] expectations of the presence of God
[11:53] within us. So let's start with Aaron's
[11:56] rod
[11:58] numbers 17 and verse 1 to10. And the
[12:02] Lord spake unto Moses saying, "Speak
[12:05] unto the children of Israel, and take
[12:07] every one of them a rod according to the
[12:10] house of their fathers, of all the
[12:12] princes according to the house of their
[12:14] fathers, 12 rods. Write thou every man's
[12:18] name upon his rod. Thou shalt write
[12:21] Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi. For
[12:24] one rod shall be for the head of the
[12:26] house of their fathers.
[12:28] And thou shalt lay them up in the
[12:29] tabernacle of the congregation before
[12:31] the testimony where I will meet with
[12:34] you. And it shall come to pass that the
[12:37] man's rod whom I shall choose whom I
[12:40] shall choose shall blossom. And I will
[12:44] make to cease from me the murmurings of
[12:47] the children of Israel whereby they
[12:49] murmur against you. And Moses spake unto
[12:53] the children of Israel, and every one of
[12:55] their princes gave him a rod a piece.
[12:58] For each prince won one, according to
[13:01] their father's houses, even 12 rods. And
[13:04] the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
[13:08] And Moses laid up the rods before the
[13:10] Lord in the tabernacle of witness. And
[13:12] it came to pass that on the tomorrow
[13:15] Moses went into the tabernacle of
[13:16] witness and behold the rod of Aaron for
[13:19] the house of Levi was budded and brought
[13:22] forth buds and bloomed blossoms and
[13:26] yielded almonds.
[13:28] And Moses brought out all the rods from
[13:30] before the Lord unto all the children of
[13:33] Israel. And they looked and took every
[13:36] man his rod. And the Lord said unto
[13:39] Moses, "Bring Aaron's rod again before
[13:42] the testimony, that is, bring it back
[13:44] inside the veil to be kept for a token
[13:49] against the rebels, and thou shalt quite
[13:52] take away their murmurings from me that
[13:55] they die not."
[13:58] So the first thing we notice is the
[14:00] effect of being in the realm of God's
[14:03] presence.
[14:05] Something dead is brought to life having
[14:09] no root or natural conditions.
[14:13] Right? In other words, something coming
[14:16] to life with no root or natural
[14:19] conditions. In other words, this stick
[14:21] was not placed in the ground. It didn't
[14:24] have water poured on it. It didn't have
[14:27] sunlight. Clearly, there's no light. It
[14:29] was pitch dark in the Holiest of Holies.
[14:33] Unless the shikina presence of God was
[14:35] there, there was no light. So there's no
[14:38] normal conditions that this rod could
[14:41] have budded.
[14:43] Everybody understood there was no
[14:44] trickery involved here. And then of
[14:47] course all the other sticks were there
[14:49] but only this one budded. So the first
[14:52] thing to notice something dead is
[14:54] brought to life having no
[14:58] physical scientific factual proof of
[15:02] anything.
[15:04] Now let's read the message of the ark
[15:08] paragraph 150.
[15:10] Notice as he walked he took his ark.
[15:12] Also Aaron's rod was put in there and
[15:14] budded. An old rod that was dead. a
[15:18] staff, a stick, no more than a piece of
[15:21] wood right there that all life is gone
[15:23] from. It's dry as it can be. But once
[15:28] put into that holy place, it lived
[15:30] again.
[15:31] Every sinner, I don't care how dull, how
[15:34] black, what your life has been, in the
[15:36] presence of Christ, you'll live again
[15:38] and bloom and bring forth blossoms,
[15:40] nourished of the spirit. How sick you
[15:42] are, that doesn't matter. You will live
[15:45] yet in the presence of the atonement.
[15:47] What a marvel. What a thing we have
[15:50] under consideration. What a scripture.
[15:53] What a God. What perfect, what a sure
[15:56] foundation.
[15:58] All other grounds is sinking sand. All
[16:00] other grounds is sinking sand.
[16:03] So brothers and sisters,
[16:06] this proves to us firstly that no matter
[16:09] what, the realm of God's presence is
[16:13] where the miraculous is possible. Now,
[16:15] we're not even talking about
[16:18] on your body realm, on the outside
[16:21] that's visible or on the spirit, your
[16:24] mind where you can reason or your
[16:27] emotions can feel. We're talking about
[16:30] deep inside the soul where there's no
[16:33] feeling,
[16:35] where there's no sensations,
[16:38] the miraculous is possible.
[16:41] The miraculous beyond what you can
[16:43] comprehend.
[16:46] but that you would know.
[16:51] All right. Secondly, many of the elders
[16:54] of Israel were constantly murmuring
[16:56] against Moses and Aaron. They were
[16:58] contesting the authority of Moses and
[16:59] Aaron. Some believe that God could speak
[17:02] through them as well and that Moses and
[17:04] Aaron took too much authority for
[17:06] themselves.
[17:08] God did this so that the people would
[17:10] recognize the election of God. Remember,
[17:14] notice God did this to show his
[17:18] election.
[17:20] Now, watch how beautiful this thought
[17:21] is.
[17:23] Let's ask some relevant serious
[17:26] questions.
[17:28] Why didn't the other rods also bud?
[17:32] They were in the presence of the Most
[17:34] High.
[17:36] There was nothing special about Aaron's
[17:38] rod. It was from an almond tree. It was
[17:41] a dead stick like every other. So why
[17:44] did it bud and all the others not?
[17:49] Were the other sticks the wrong make?
[17:53] What if all the rods were taken from the
[17:55] same tree as Aaron's? Would they all
[17:57] have budded because they came from the
[17:59] same tree? Can you see then that it has
[18:02] nothing to do with that?
[18:05] Shouldn't everything that comes into his
[18:07] presence receive eternal life? Well,
[18:10] clearly not.
[18:12] The only answer can be that it budded
[18:16] because God chose it.
[18:20] Now, we know that scripture that we read
[18:22] tells us that this tells us so much
[18:25] about election. In other words, you
[18:28] could be in the presence of God and be
[18:30] absolutely dead unless he chooses you
[18:35] for his purpose.
[18:38] So on the one hand it is glorious to be
[18:41] in the realm of God's presence and on
[18:43] the other hand it can have absolutely no
[18:45] effect on you and you could just be a
[18:48] copycat.
[18:50] So the presence of God is not some
[18:53] magical energy that whoever comes in
[18:55] contact with it becomes positively
[18:57] charged by it. Our biggest proof is the
[19:00] Lord Jesus Christ himself.
[19:03] After his three and a half year
[19:04] ministry, more people hated him than
[19:07] loved him. He didn't heal every person
[19:10] at the pool of Bethesda.
[19:13] He didn't feed every hungry person he
[19:16] found. He didn't take Israel's enemies
[19:20] away.
[19:22] He didn't convince the whole world with
[19:24] his teachings. He spoke death to a tree
[19:28] that didn't produce fruit to him.
[19:31] He left
[19:33] only
[19:35] 120 followers
[19:37] after he ascended
[19:40] and they all paid a price for his
[19:42] presence being made visible on their
[19:44] body realm. They were martyed,
[19:47] persecuted and killed.
[19:51] So let's not fool ourselves into taking
[19:53] it for granted that we had that we and
[19:56] everyone understands the realm of God's
[19:59] presence. Just from this example alone,
[20:03] you can see that telling people these
[20:05] things is going to make them really
[20:07] upset. They're going to say, "God is
[20:10] unfair. Why is he unfair? Why did he not
[20:13] allow all the rods to be budded? Why
[20:15] just Aaron's rod? Why should there be
[20:18] election? Why didn't Christ heal more
[20:21] people? Why didn't he feed the hungry?
[20:22] Why didn't he do this? Why didn't he do
[20:24] that?"
[20:25] And and we know that it's the people's
[20:29] false understanding that brings false
[20:32] expectations.
[20:34] And so today people in the message
[20:38] because they don't have an understanding
[20:39] of the word, they have false
[20:42] expectations of God. Now how do I know
[20:44] that they are false expectations? Well,
[20:47] because when things don't work according
[20:49] to the way they want it, they lose faith
[20:51] in the word. Now losing faith in the
[20:54] word already tells you that from the
[20:58] very beginning you had a false
[21:00] understanding.
[21:01] Therefore you had false expectations.
[21:05] From Aaron's rod we can draw one
[21:07] conclusion.
[21:09] Anything can be brought into that
[21:11] presence. But he will only bring to life
[21:14] that which he has chosen, predestined
[21:17] and purposed for himself. Now that's
[21:22] that's a wonderful thought in case you
[21:24] didn't you may think well you know you
[21:27] can apply this to you in in different
[21:29] ways
[21:30] but the most important thing is
[21:34] you can listen to all kinds of
[21:36] preaching. You could listen to false
[21:39] doctrines. You could have sat under the
[21:41] teachings of someone who was teaching
[21:43] the thunders wrong. You could have sat
[21:46] under someone preaching that the seventh
[21:48] seal is not open and that
[21:52] word that you were hearing passed
[21:54] through the veils
[21:56] yourself will said my amen I really
[22:00] accept that and then that goes into your
[22:02] soul realm but thank God because those
[22:05] rods that went in was not his chosen
[22:09] word and did not take root. It did not
[22:12] bud. It did not flower. it did not bring
[22:15] forth.
[22:17] We should be so happy for that. That
[22:19] that that is the way the presence of God
[22:22] operates because we were kept safe from
[22:25] wrong doctrines being instilled into our
[22:29] lives being uh passed down through our
[22:33] body so that it made us that it would
[22:36] make us form believers of the wrong
[22:38] thing. Praise be to God. Saints, even
[22:42] life's philosophers could have no effect
[22:44] on you if you were elect. What I mean to
[22:47] say is that
[22:49] maybe you were not sitting in a message
[22:51] church. Maybe you were some other
[22:53] religion. Some maybe you were Muslim.
[22:55] Maybe you were Hindu. Maybe you were um
[22:58] I don't know um not even belonging to
[23:01] any religion. Maybe you were atheist.
[23:02] Maybe you were somebody who listened to
[23:05] philosophies of the world. But somehow
[23:08] or the other, those things made sense in
[23:11] your mind. You would talk about them.
[23:13] You would fellowship with them, with
[23:15] other people. You would share your
[23:17] thoughts with other people. You'd be
[23:19] strong in your in your um delivery of
[23:22] your thoughts. But somehow or the other,
[23:24] you still had the emptiness in your
[23:26] soul. The emptiness in your soul
[23:29] indicates that none of those ministries
[23:32] that passed into that presence could
[23:35] ever be grammatized or budded. It would
[23:38] have to take the rod of Aaron.
[23:43] And you can tell what that that type is
[23:45] of. It would have to take the spoken
[23:49] word of God that comes through the son
[23:51] of man ministry of this day. If you're a
[23:53] believer, you're guaranteed to have a
[23:56] really lousy life until you receive this
[24:00] word. And then only does your soul get
[24:04] filled. Maybe you may have problems in
[24:06] the body realm and in the outside and
[24:08] your spirit, your mind, and you have
[24:10] trials like everybody else. But when the
[24:12] realm of God's presence has taken its
[24:15] place in your soul, then you have
[24:18] something that no other human on earth
[24:21] has. Amen. Saints, I believe we should
[24:25] really thank the Lord for this. We
[24:28] should really appreciate
[24:30] what God has done for us and really
[24:34] understand what these things mean and
[24:37] become so much more aware of what has
[24:40] taken place in our lives and what is
[24:43] taking place every day. Let's get to the
[24:45] next point which is the manner in the
[24:48] golden pot. Now remember these two
[24:50] things were added. So, we always knew
[24:52] there was the mercy seat, the ark of the
[24:54] covenant behind the veil, and we knew we
[24:58] know that the the law was set in place
[25:02] uh beneath that mercy seat. But what
[25:04] we're seeing is that the realm of God's
[25:07] presence, so the mercy seat, the pillar
[25:10] of fire, the the law that was placed
[25:13] under the mercy seat um brought the
[25:17] presence of God into that place.
[25:21] But we want to see from these little
[25:23] these little stories about for example
[25:26] the rod of Aaron and now the manner from
[25:28] the golden pot and see the
[25:30] characteristics
[25:32] of what the realm of God's presence
[25:34] does. So let's get to this manner in the
[25:37] golden pot. And what we find here is the
[25:40] mystery of sustaining the word of life.
[25:45] Okay. Exodus 16:31-33.
[25:49] And the house of Israel called the name
[25:51] thereof mana, and it was like coriander
[25:54] seed, white, and the taste of it was
[25:57] like wafers made with honey. And Moses
[26:00] said, "This is the thing which the Lord
[26:02] commandeth. Fill an o of it to be kept
[26:05] for your generations, that they may see
[26:07] the bread wherewith I have fed you in
[26:09] the wilderness, when I brought you forth
[26:12] from the land of Egypt." And Moses said
[26:14] unto Aaron, take a pot, put an full of
[26:17] mana therein, and lay it up before the
[26:19] Lord to be kept for your generations.
[26:23] Now, mana was a word that was a question
[26:28] really a question that meant what is it
[26:31] and the word stuck. So, in other words,
[26:34] I remember doing this with you. Um, I
[26:37] think it was during the promised land
[26:39] experience. Um, types and shadows, but
[26:44] the people came out of their tents that
[26:46] morning and they went around looking at
[26:48] this stuff on the floor and they said,
[26:52] "Mana."
[26:53] Mana in the Hebrew means what is it? And
[26:57] so, everyone began to call it that. They
[26:59] began to call it, "What is it?" It was a
[27:02] question. The people were unfamiliar
[27:04] with it because they had not seen it
[27:06] before. It fell from from heaven as they
[27:08] thought every night and the people were
[27:11] able to gather it off the ground in the
[27:13] morning. It's quite amazing. It looked
[27:15] like beautiful coriander flowers and
[27:18] settled lightly on the ground and its
[27:20] taste was incredible. Wafers with honey.
[27:26] Uh, I don't think any one of us can
[27:29] really fully comprehend that. So, it it
[27:32] it was probably something that looked
[27:34] like like a type of uh flour or a a
[27:40] light when I say flour, I mean ground
[27:43] flour, but or kind of like a light meal
[27:46] porridge, but it could be easily
[27:49] gathered off the floor off the ground.
[27:52] And this um and it had a taste. It
[27:55] probably looked like the Bible said like
[27:57] coriander flowers. So it must must have
[28:00] been like small particles almost like
[28:02] like snowflakes.
[28:04] And this this and and tasted like wafers
[28:07] with honey. I mean that's just amazing.
[28:11] But this mana was a type of the word
[28:13] that came by the prophet before the
[28:16] seals. It was spiritual food in due
[28:19] season. It was revelations that fell
[28:21] from heaven that we had never seen
[28:23] before. It tasted amazing when you
[28:26] gathered it up. Like for example,
[28:27] serpent seed, water baptism, godhead, no
[28:31] eternal hell, predestination, Daniel 70
[28:34] weeks, uh you know, demonology,
[28:38] adoption,
[28:39] amazing things dropped everywhere.
[28:42] Revelation of Jesus Christ series. Oh,
[28:45] just sweet. absolutely sweet
[28:49] uh tasting food that fell from heaven
[28:51] which we had never seen before. And I
[28:55] suppose the question is always what is
[28:57] it? What is it about this? How is this
[29:01] so amazing? How could we never see this
[29:02] before? Where did it come from? But
[29:05] there were a few conditions to this
[29:07] word. You could not keep the manner of
[29:10] one day for the next because it
[29:13] contaminated. In other words, the
[29:15] message had to be fresh every day to
[29:18] you. You could not denominate around it.
[29:21] It would contaminate.
[29:23] This manner was incredible. It's like it
[29:25] had a mind of its own. Every day for 5
[29:28] days, so let's say for our for our
[29:31] understanding from Sunday to Thursday,
[29:35] the people could only gather an om which
[29:38] is a certain stipulated amount per
[29:41] person. If they went over that amount,
[29:44] it became corrupted. So somehow that
[29:47] that manner knew when they took too much
[29:50] because they were greedy. This like some
[29:53] people who try to make more of the
[29:55] revelation than what is allowed for
[29:57] their season, it contaminated their
[29:59] systems.
[30:01] It fell as the dew upon the ground. They
[30:04] had to awake early in the morning and
[30:06] gather for themselves. They couldn't
[30:08] wait too long because as the sun grew
[30:10] hotter, the mana melted and disappeared.
[30:13] When the revelation comes, you gather it
[30:16] as soon as you can. You cannot
[30:17] procrastinate. You'll be left hungry. As
[30:20] is the the experience of a lot of people
[30:25] who thought who didn't realize they
[30:27] should strike while the iron's hot. That
[30:30] happens a lot with people when the call
[30:32] of the word tugs at your heart about
[30:35] these certain things and you say, "Nah,
[30:37] I don't believe it. You know, I'm not
[30:39] really ready for that." By the time you
[30:42] think you're ready for it to try and go
[30:43] back to it, it's already escaped your
[30:45] mind and you can't come back to it until
[30:47] the next day.
[30:49] So then they also couldn't keep it over
[30:53] for the next day. They couldn't gather
[30:54] that one and say, "All right, you know,
[30:57] I don't want to eat. I'll eat half and
[30:59] keep the other half for the next day.
[31:01] I'm sure there were people who tried it
[31:03] at that time. They couldn't because it
[31:05] became corrupted. It didn't just corrupt
[31:08] itself. It became full of maggots. Now,
[31:12] think about that. Full of maggots means
[31:15] it it rotted.
[31:18] Right now, you're you're talking about a
[31:21] type that is referring to heavenly food,
[31:24] spiritual food induced season. How could
[31:27] that become full of maggots? That can
[31:29] tell you what trouble and what disaster
[31:34] message people can cause with those
[31:37] first and second pull anointed messages
[31:41] of the prophet.
[31:43] Trying to stay stuck on yesterday's
[31:45] revelation leads to demonology. No
[31:48] wonder Paul says, "Let us leave the
[31:50] first principles of Christ and go on
[31:52] unto perfection."
[31:54] But on the sixth day, for our example,
[31:58] Friday, they would they were together
[32:01] two om
[32:04] they would consume on the sixth day and
[32:06] the other om they would keep for the
[32:07] Sabbath. So it seems like
[32:10] the mana kind of knew that on the fifth
[32:13] day they would have to gather two omas
[32:17] and it had no problem with that on the
[32:19] fifth day. So then on the sixth day they
[32:22] would have two omomas as they would eat
[32:24] of one and the other one would remain
[32:25] for two days. In other words, this this
[32:29] had a sense for the Sabbath.
[32:32] It remained until the Sabbath ended but
[32:34] not over to the first day again. In
[32:36] other words, they couldn't decide to
[32:38] keep it till Monday
[32:41] or Sunday. Right? So this like when you
[32:44] reach the time of a Sabbath on a on a
[32:47] revelation, God allows you to relax and
[32:50] he builds on what you gleaned
[32:52] previously.
[32:54] But the manner was not meant to
[32:55] continue.
[32:58] There even reached a time when the
[32:59] people said, "We loathe this like
[33:02] bread." See, the people began to become
[33:07] angry and bored and and uh testy with
[33:12] the first and second pull ministry with
[33:15] the messages from prior to the seals.
[33:18] And uh over 20 or 30 years, the message
[33:22] began to become common to them till deep
[33:25] inside they felt a loathing against it.
[33:28] And you could tell from the lives of the
[33:30] people that they were just ready to
[33:32] leave the message. See the message
[33:35] becoming common to them and they
[33:37] couldn't hear it anymore. They lost
[33:38] their way. They were not patient. They
[33:40] began lusting after the flesh parts of
[33:42] Egypt. Meaning they began to lust after
[33:45] other philosophies, denominational
[33:47] ideas, bringing back gifts of the Holy
[33:50] Ghost, trying to restore old worship
[33:53] again. But those who were patient and
[33:56] stayed with the word used the mana as
[34:00] the prophet commanded. They crossed over
[34:02] into the great revelation beyond Jordan.
[34:06] And we see in type that the mana stopped
[34:09] when they crossed over Jordan into the
[34:11] promised land. Mana had its place to
[34:14] sustain you until you were ready to
[34:16] cross over into the deeper parched corn
[34:20] of the land. You remember these things.
[34:23] So what we're saying is for a person who
[34:29] uh who had patience with the first and
[34:32] second pole ministry and endured
[34:35] though they had many trials though the
[34:37] mana didn't fall on the seventh day we
[34:42] crossed through the opening of the
[34:43] seventh seal that is crossing through
[34:45] Jordan holding on for God to bring to us
[34:50] the revelation of the open book. And
[34:54] once that took place, we didn't need to
[34:56] go back to the first and second pole
[34:58] ministries.
[35:00] The the new open book made everything
[35:04] new to us.
[35:06] It became a third pole ministry.
[35:10] So even all the messages and you can you
[35:12] can check this out in uh under his third
[35:14] pole ministry in even marriage and
[35:16] divorce. Brother Ram said everything
[35:19] became new. water baptism, Godhead,
[35:21] serpent seed and everything. He said all
[35:22] those mysteries that we once preached
[35:25] became new, brought a new understanding
[35:28] after the seals were open. So we see in
[35:31] type the mana stopping when they crossed
[35:34] over Jordan into the promised land. Mana
[35:36] had its place. And of course now there's
[35:40] no question. There's no what is it? Now
[35:44] when we when we feasting off the corn of
[35:46] the land, we know what it is because
[35:49] everything has been revealed.
[35:51] So mana had its place. It was supposed
[35:54] to sustain you until you were ready uh
[35:58] to cross over into the deeper parched
[36:00] corner of the land. Now notice when
[36:02] Christ was here,
[36:05] they asked him a question. Show us a
[36:07] sign. Our fathers ate mana in the
[36:10] wilderness. He said to them, "Your
[36:13] fathers ate mana and are dead."
[36:17] He was signifying that there was a mana
[36:20] greater than what fell in the
[36:22] wilderness. Right? Which brings us to
[36:26] the hidden manner which is sustaining of
[36:29] the written word.
[36:32] So God told Moses to collect an omr of
[36:37] the mana from the wilderness and put it
[36:40] behind the veil in a golden pot. This
[36:44] manner never failed. It never ran out
[36:47] and it never corrupted.
[36:50] In other words,
[36:52] what was the difference between the
[36:54] manner that was taken into the holiest
[36:56] of all, the most holy place, and the
[36:59] manner that fell out in the wilderness?
[37:01] Why did this manner
[37:04] not fail, run out or or become
[37:06] corrupted? The difference was the
[37:09] presence of God. This manner was placed
[37:12] in the realm of God's presence, right?
[37:16] The word of days gone by stays fresh and
[37:20] will not contaminate
[37:22] or be able to be denominated if it is
[37:26] taken past the veil of selfworld and
[37:28] allowed to remain in the soul which is
[37:31] the realm of God's presence. This proves
[37:34] to us that the the usual human attempt
[37:37] to keep the word in the spirit realm of
[37:39] the mind of a believer usually ends in
[37:42] disaster.
[37:45] All right.
[37:46] So, what are we saying here? It'll
[37:49] always become corrupt on the outside. If
[37:52] you receive the word on the fleshly
[37:54] realm, it's always going to corrupt. It
[37:57] always comes with conditions. You have
[37:59] to keep waiting. You have to move on
[38:01] from there to uh the next revelation and
[38:05] the next revelation and wait for the
[38:07] next one. Week in [clears throat] and
[38:08] week out. You've got to live from Sunday
[38:10] to Sunday, Wednesday to Wednesday for
[38:13] something to happen, right? And if you
[38:16] don't and if you try to denominate
[38:19] around what you heard before, it will
[38:22] corrupt you,
[38:24] right? Because it always corrupt on the
[38:26] outside because of false
[38:27] interpretations, your own thinking, the
[38:30] thinking of others, and the effects of
[38:32] life on you. That's what's going to
[38:34] happen, right? But if that word is that
[38:39] that manner is taken in behind the veil
[38:44] then it is in the realm of God's
[38:46] presence and it is transformed into
[38:50] eternal word right listen to the message
[38:54] a hidden life God said Moses make you a
[38:57] golden pot hallelujah and therein place
[38:59] this mana and remember that a believer
[39:02] when he walked in there that mana never
[39:05] did run out. It was always fresh and new
[39:08] and sweet as the days went by, as the
[39:11] years went by. And any man who comes to
[39:13] Christ and hides away and the veil falls
[39:16] behind him, he's in the presence of
[39:17] Almighty God eating the mana day and
[39:20] night from hour to from one hour to the
[39:23] other. It's always just as sweet as it
[39:25] was the first day of telling to your
[39:28] soul.
[39:29] The first day of telling to your soul.
[39:32] That's what we need today is get in
[39:34] where the things are and not stand off
[39:36] and pretend, not stand off and act, but
[39:40] actually get in there. Amen. Let's read
[39:42] Pergeamean Church paragraph 305. Well,
[39:45] what is the hidden manner? The manner
[39:48] that isn't given to all of the
[39:50] congregation. The revelation is poured
[39:53] out upon the angel of the church. The
[39:55] revelation of the word. See, the
[39:57] revelation of the word is given to the
[39:58] angel of that age. For it's hidden from
[40:01] everywhere and revealed back the hidden
[40:04] manner to it addressed to the angel of
[40:06] the church. See you get it. It's a and
[40:08] watch the saints. It's a little bigger
[40:11] revelation of what Christ is. Maybe a
[40:14] little higher call.
[40:16] So it is something that gives the
[40:19] messenger that something extra to give
[40:21] him faith to bring the word without
[40:23] question.
[40:24] It made the messenger the authority of
[40:27] the word for for his age. Now you see
[40:30] the written word remains the same on the
[40:33] outer realms. If you just receive the
[40:35] written word, you read the Bible, you
[40:37] read the message, it remains the same on
[40:39] the outer realms. But when it is brought
[40:42] into the realm of his presence, it gives
[40:45] a little bigger revelation of what
[40:47] Christ is. Amen.
[40:51] Beautiful brothers and sisters. See when
[40:54] that manner that is the same thing that
[40:56] the other people are reading those same
[40:58] spoken word books but when there is the
[41:01] presence of God in your soul now you
[41:04] need to know how that presence of God
[41:06] must get there. A lot of people reading
[41:08] the message and it's going in and
[41:10] there's no presence of God there.
[41:11] There's a reason for that. The gene seed
[41:14] hasn't been germinated. It hasn't been
[41:16] jerked to life by the rising of the sun.
[41:18] means clearly saying it they haven't
[41:20] seen the opening of the seventh seal yet
[41:22] to them personally because when the
[41:23] seventh seal opens to the person to the
[41:26] believer personally that's when the
[41:27] presence of God comes in and that's when
[41:29] your most holy place is operational
[41:33] prior to that it's not operational
[41:37] and we can prove that to you throughout
[41:39] the scripture
[41:40] so it is when that presence of God is in
[41:45] there and the written word comes in it
[41:48] then become brings a bigger revelation
[41:50] of what Christ is. Let's read the
[41:52] message harvest time paragraph 204.
[41:56] The word bread always means to be fed
[41:59] on. And man shall not live by bread like
[42:02] this bread alone but by every word. So
[42:05] that the word bread, keep that in mind.
[42:08] This is this bread that the church
[42:10] through every age has fed on has been
[42:13] the hidden manner just for the overcomer
[42:15] only. Revelation said so. Now, I don't
[42:18] have time to break this whole thing
[42:19] down, he says, because I probably got
[42:21] another 30 minutes. But look, when the
[42:23] holy mana fell from heaven, which was a
[42:26] type of the Holy Ghost, you'll agree on
[42:28] that. God told Moses to go out and get
[42:31] an full of it and put it in the holiest
[42:33] of holies. Cuz if they didn't put in the
[42:35] Holiest of Holies, it became stagnant.
[42:37] Is that right? The worms got into it.
[42:40] Now he said, "But put it in the holiest
[42:42] of holies in this om that every
[42:43] generation coming up after that
[42:45] priesthood, when a man comes to go to be
[42:47] a priest to minister the word, the first
[42:51] thing he gets to do after he is ordained
[42:53] is go in and get a handful of that
[42:55] original manner and eat it." That was to
[42:58] represent that light in his hand in the
[43:02] new church age reflecting his light. the
[43:05] manner the the and only the man that
[43:08] perfectly overcame overcome the man that
[43:12] really sits down and throws aside
[43:13] everything else besides the word and the
[43:16] word is a manner oh my it's Jesus man
[43:19] shall live by every word that proceeds
[43:21] out of the mouth of God that's the
[43:23] hidden manner for the overcomer all that
[43:25] was laid up each for each priesthood of
[43:28] following it so saints every man who
[43:32] feels led to minister must get behind
[43:35] the veil and eat of that original mana
[43:37] that fell that was preserved for every
[43:40] generation.
[43:42] He must go in and eat it himself before
[43:44] bringing it out to the people. So
[43:46] saints, what is this saying translating
[43:49] to our day? This means he must properly
[43:52] understand the first principles and the
[43:54] word of the of the days of old today
[43:56] even for every believer is important
[43:58] that we get the understanding that is
[44:00] behind the veil.
[44:03] Right? But to even get the understanding
[44:06] of the golden pot, the hidden mana,
[44:09] [clears throat] there needs to first be
[44:11] the presence of God in that soul because
[44:14] then only can that hidden manner be
[44:16] transformed into eternal manner. Do you
[44:20] get it? John 6:30-37
[44:25] They said therefore unto him, "What sign
[44:28] showst thou that we may see and believe
[44:30] thee? What dost thou work? Our fathers
[44:33] did eat mana in the desert.
[44:36] As it is written, he gave them bread
[44:38] from heaven to eat. Then Jesus answered
[44:41] and said to them, verily, verily, I say
[44:43] unto you, Moses gave you not that bread
[44:46] from heaven, but my father giveth you
[44:48] the true bread from heaven. For the
[44:51] bread of God is he that cometh down from
[44:53] heaven. Listen, the bread of God is he
[44:58] which cometh down from heaven and giveth
[45:00] life unto the world. Then said they unto
[45:03] him,
[45:04] Lord, ever more give us this bread. And
[45:07] Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of
[45:10] life. He that cometh to me shall never
[45:12] hunger, and that believeth on me shall
[45:14] never thirst. But I say unto you that
[45:16] you also have seen me, and believe not.
[45:20] All that the father giveth me shall come
[45:22] to me and him that come cometh to me I
[45:25] will in no wise cast out. Let's read
[45:27] verse 41 to 45.
[45:30] The Jews then murmured at him because he
[45:32] said I am the bread which come down from
[45:34] heaven. And they said is not this Jesus
[45:38] the son of Joseph whose father and
[45:39] mother we know? How is it then that he
[45:42] saith I came down from heaven? Jesus
[45:45] therefore answered and said unto them,
[45:48] "Murmur not among yourselves. No man can
[45:52] come to me except the Father which had
[45:54] sent him, sent me, draw him,
[45:58] and I will raise him up at the last day.
[46:01] It is written in the prophets, and they
[46:03] shall be taught of God. Every man
[46:06] therefore that hath heard and learned of
[46:09] the Father cometh to me, cometh unto
[46:12] me." Verse 48 to 50 he says, "I am that
[46:16] bread of life. Your fathers did eat mana
[46:18] in the wilderness and are dead. This is
[46:21] the bread which cometh down from heaven
[46:23] that a man may eat thereof and not die."
[46:27] So notice saints, the realm of God's
[46:29] presence doesn't only bring life. It
[46:34] proves election and it keeps alive alive
[46:37] the word of every other day and will
[46:40] allow it to not contaminate or will not
[46:43] allow it to contaminate.
[46:46] Saints, every believer must have his
[46:48] soul being or becoming the realm of
[46:51] God's presence. We just have to. It will
[46:53] spring to life your true nature which
[46:55] was dead like Aaron's rod and it will
[46:59] give you an assurance of your of your
[47:01] election and it will never allow the
[47:04] written word to become stale to you. I
[47:07] mean which believer doesn't want that
[47:09] experience or that to continue in his
[47:12] life.
[47:14] All right. So we get to the last point
[47:16] before we close which is the blood of
[47:18] the atonement
[47:21] or as I will call it the true cleansing
[47:23] by the presence of God. Let's read
[47:26] Leviticus 16:14 to 15. And he shall take
[47:29] of the blood of the bullock and sprinkle
[47:31] it with his finger upon the mercy seat
[47:33] eastward. And before the mercy seat
[47:35] shall shall he sprinkle of the blood
[47:37] with his finger seven times. And then
[47:39] shall he kill the goat of the sin
[47:41] offering and it is for the people that
[47:43] it is for the people and bring his blood
[47:45] within the veil and do with that blood
[47:47] as he did with the blood of the bulock
[47:49] that is sprinkle it upon the mercy seat
[47:51] and before the mercy seat now I don't
[47:53] want to labor this point too much by
[47:55] reading all the scriptures of the
[47:57] atonement but it is just as important
[48:00] all other sacrifices were offered and
[48:03] accepted on the outside altar of brass
[48:06] that is the sacrificial altar
[48:09] But this blood of the atonement for sins
[48:13] had to be taken into the realm of God's
[48:15] presence. Remember saints, the priest
[48:19] had to make atonement for himself first
[48:22] and then the people with the blood of
[48:25] the atonement. Now, it is so easy to be
[48:30] touched emotionally
[48:32] and be affected by the word on the
[48:35] spirit realm within the first veil. You
[48:38] could say, "Man, I was so convicted by
[48:42] the preaching of the word. I really want
[48:45] to change. I felt something. I had such
[48:48] an experience and I really want to turn
[48:50] my life around and want to uh turn over
[48:54] a new leaf for the next year. and I
[48:55] really want to do that and I want to do
[48:57] that.
[49:00] You notice that after making all those
[49:02] pledges and
[49:05] promises to God,
[49:08] it doesn't take long. In fact, in most
[49:10] cases, the next day you're back to
[49:11] square one.
[49:14] You will never change and you will never
[49:16] see the true effect of atonement for
[49:19] sins unless that blood goes into the
[49:23] realm of his presence.
[49:25] behind the second veil.
[49:28] Let's express this out. If you follow
[49:32] the scriptures on the atonement that is
[49:34] from Leviticus 16, you will see that the
[49:37] blood of the bullock and the goats is
[49:40] used for atonement
[49:43] for [snorts] listen the inner court and
[49:46] its belongings, the outer court and its
[49:49] belongings as well as the most holy
[49:52] place and its belongings. also that
[49:55] blood had to be offered up for the high
[49:58] priest and the people separately.
[50:03] But before the blood is sprinkled on
[50:06] anything else, the blood must be brought
[50:09] into the realm of God's presence,
[50:13] sprinkled upon the mercy seat and then
[50:16] upward to sprinkle it on everything
[50:18] else.
[50:20] Amen.
[50:22] Right? So remember the blood must be
[50:24] brought into the realm of God's
[50:26] presence, sprinkled upon the mercy seat
[50:28] and then the blood was to be taken out
[50:30] to be sprinkled in the inner court on
[50:33] the candlesticks table of showbread
[50:35] altar of incense then go out last and
[50:38] sprinkle it in the tabernacle in the
[50:40] courts of the tabernacle upon the horns
[50:43] of the brazen altar and so on.
[50:47] Now you see a lot of people talk about
[50:50] being washed in the blood of the lamb,
[50:53] right?
[50:54] We know that the blood of Calvary is not
[50:58] physical blood today, right? The blood
[51:01] of Calvary is gone long, long time ago.
[51:05] We know that the blood of Calvary is not
[51:07] physical blood today.
[51:10] It has to do with specific provoking
[51:14] word of God that convicts the soul of
[51:16] man. It is the blood cell of the spoken
[51:20] word.
[51:22] You can hear the word being preached and
[51:25] it can do different things to you. For
[51:27] example, it can make you happy, set your
[51:30] feet into purpose, make you angry
[51:32] against sinful things. But the part of
[51:35] the word that comes when you have
[51:36] faltered against God is the blood of the
[51:40] word.
[51:42] It comes at a cost. But it comes for
[51:45] your salvation.
[51:47] It tugs at the very inside of your soul
[51:50] and your mind and body can submit to it
[51:52] in such ways that you can break down and
[51:55] scream and cry and search for God's
[51:57] forgiveness and mercy.
[52:00] But saints, don't mistake those feelings
[52:02] and emotions for being truly cleansed
[52:04] and sanctified.
[52:06] That blood cell of the word
[52:11] must go into the realm of God's
[52:14] presence. This means saints, you don't
[52:17] just go from one service of emotions to
[52:21] another, from one service to another,
[52:24] from Sunday to Sunday, from Wednesday to
[52:25] Wednesday. You stay in that presence of
[52:28] that blood cell. That means when that
[52:31] word comes forth from the preacher
[52:33] preaching behind the pulpit
[52:35] and some particular day and that word
[52:38] begins to convict you,
[52:41] you go home from that service. You get
[52:44] into that word. You follow the leading
[52:46] of that blood cell. Let it take you
[52:49] through the scriptures. Share it with
[52:51] your brothers and sisters. Fellowship on
[52:53] it. Pray on it. Let it be absorbed
[52:57] completely into your soul and then watch
[53:00] how that blood truly sets you free.
[53:03] Saints, the most holy place is a truly
[53:07] special place with strange and wonderful
[53:09] capabilities that escapes the thinking
[53:12] of man. Understanding it makes us truly
[53:15] appreciate the need for the presence of
[53:18] God to be in our soul. saints. Without
[53:20] it, the emotions we feel of conversion
[53:23] and sanctification and cleansing would
[53:25] all be intellectual and just emotions.
[53:29] If you have a soul that is the realm of
[53:31] God's presence and that gene seed has
[53:34] come to life and is abiding, then the
[53:37] spoken word that you can hear
[53:41] or the spoken word that you hear can
[53:43] find its way through and be sanctified
[53:46] to go back out into the whole tabernacle
[53:48] to bring a true change and cleansing
[53:51] that you will never fall from again.
[53:53] Remember the priest brought brought the
[53:56] blood of the atonement in. Once the
[53:58] blood of the atonement was sprinkled on
[54:01] the mercy seat, then he was able to go
[54:03] out with that same blood and sprinkle on
[54:06] everything else the life of God,
[54:09] sanctifying the entire tabernacle.
[54:13] And this is the problem today,
[54:17] saints. Do you get this? I want to
[54:19] really punch this through. If you have a
[54:22] soul that is the realm of God's
[54:24] presence, now this is why this is so
[54:27] important. This is why it is so
[54:29] important that believers in this end
[54:31] time under the message of this hour see
[54:34] the opening of the seventh seal. Here's
[54:36] what I'm telling you. You cannot claim
[54:40] that your soul has the the realm of
[54:43] God's presence or that your soul is the
[54:45] realm of God's presence until the open
[54:48] book is abiding in there because that
[54:51] place only becomes a throne if a book is
[54:54] on that throne. If the gene seed in you
[54:57] is alive,
[54:59] my point is if you don't have that gene
[55:02] seed for this capstone age alive and
[55:05] abiding, then the spoken word that you
[55:08] can hear that brings conviction that
[55:11] should bring cleansing
[55:14] to sanctify you to cleanse you of false
[55:17] belief to cleanse you of mistakes and
[55:20] errors and and misjudgments
[55:23] that if if you don't have that gene
[55:26] seed, you cannot have the realm of God's
[55:28] presence. And if you don't have the
[55:29] realm of God's presence, then you are
[55:31] basically you basically have an
[55:33] intellectual cleansing and
[55:35] sanctification.
[55:37] And sure enough, you're going to keep
[55:39] falling by that
[55:41] back and back into the same mistakes
[55:44] over and over again. But once there is
[55:49] the presence of God dwelling in the soul
[55:53] and that blood of the atonement, that
[55:55] blood cell word, remember I I said the
[55:59] specifics of the word, the word does
[56:00] several things to us. But when somebody
[56:04] preaches provoking thoughts for
[56:07] conviction and those convictions stir up
[56:11] something inside that must bring a
[56:12] change that must change your ways and
[56:14] point you in a different direction. When
[56:17] those words have come to you to change
[56:20] you for the better that is the blood
[56:22] cell of the word. That's the immunity of
[56:25] the body. That's the immunity of the
[56:27] word that's going to pass through.
[56:29] That's got to be offered on the altar of
[56:32] your soul, sprinkled in the altar of
[56:34] your soul. In other words, it must come
[56:37] through the presence of the open book
[56:39] before it goes back out into your mind
[56:42] to cleanse your spirit, before it goes
[56:44] back out from there into your body, to
[56:46] cleanse your behavior.
[56:49] See, which means people who claim to
[56:52] have been cleansed and sanctified and
[56:54] all of those things and yet deny the
[56:57] open book
[56:59] don't have the most holy place set up in
[57:02] their in their souls. What kind of
[57:04] sanctification do they have? What kind
[57:06] of cleansing do they have? Sure enough,
[57:09] they're going to defect from the word,
[57:11] and their testimony of being sanctified
[57:15] and cleansed is going to go down the
[57:17] tube because there was no realm of God's
[57:21] presence for that blood that they
[57:23] received to be offered up to then anoint
[57:27] everything else in the tabernacle.
[57:32] Saints, I trust that this would be a
[57:34] blessing to us. really Aaron's rod, the
[57:39] hidden manner, the blood of the
[57:41] atonement. What does the most holy place
[57:45] mean to me personally? What does the
[57:47] realm of God's presence mean to you
[57:50] personally? Why do we need to get out
[57:53] from traditional denominational message
[57:57] ideas?
[57:58] Why do we need the open book to to
[58:02] become real to us? Why do we need the
[58:04] seventh seal to be open to us? Why do we
[58:06] need to have those thunders a a personal
[58:09] manifestation to us? Because without it,
[58:12] we are just a tabernacle operating
[58:15] without the realm of God's presence. We
[58:18] can't claim to have true atonement. We
[58:20] won't know whether we are the elected
[58:23] rod budding in the presence of God. We
[58:26] won't have the written word lasting
[58:30] forever and ever because there is no
[58:34] presence of God there. That is the
[58:37] reason why this most holy place had such
[58:41] a configuration and such prophecy behind
[58:44] it and so many wondrous things that took
[58:47] place surrounding this tabernacle.
[58:50] I trust saints that you will
[58:53] really appreciate what God has done by
[58:57] opening up the seven seal in this day.
[58:59] Not just that, sending a messenger to
[59:01] reveal those mysteries to us. Not just
[59:04] that, but giving the open book to every
[59:07] one of you personally. Every one of us
[59:10] personally that we might feast off the
[59:12] things of God beyond which other people
[59:16] can even fathom or even comprehend.
[59:20] Blessed our eyes and our ears. Amen. For
[59:24] we are witnesses of the divinely
[59:27] revealed mystery truths of God. We have
[59:30] the open book in our souls. We have the
[59:32] realm of God's presence. And one of
[59:35] these days all those veils are going to
[59:37] be broken. And then his presence is
[59:39] going to be seen completely in us. And
[59:42] we're looking forward to that time. May
[59:45] the Lord bless you saints. Until the
[59:47] next time.
