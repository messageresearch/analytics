TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Angels sing. &gt;&gt; Sons of God shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; Again, those attributes in the beginning were not screaming. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What is a shout? Amen. Let's read the rapture. Sunday school, listen up. Three things happen. A voice, a shout, a voice, a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears. Now, a shout. Jesus does all three of them when he is descending. A shout. What is the shout? It's the message coming forth first. The living bread of life bringing forth the bride. &gt;&gt; There is the shout. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this happens in his descent. &gt;&gt; This only comes down with the open book. &gt;&gt; Not before that. &gt;&gt; Before that, they still did not know the fellowship of the mystery. They still didn't have the shout. &gt;&gt; But the shout has come down with the second coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Paul knew that it would be revealed. See, in attribute, if they shouted in manifested time, in manifested uh form, there has to be a shout again. Sons of God must shout for joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is now silence in heaven, but there's a great shout on earth. &gt;&gt; People take these and make these literally about shouting with vocal cords. &gt;&gt; What vocal cords did the attributes have in heaven? &gt;&gt; The shout was a mystery because it was the hidden attribute form before the foundation of the world. It was in attribute form. It was not shouting with vocal cords the same way it was in singing with vocal cords. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Singing was proclaiming a victory. &gt;&gt; Shouting is what? If singing was overcoming for the angels, what is the shout for sons of God? There was no one to manifested before. It could only be manifested in the end time because the sons of God are revealed in the end time. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now it is manifest. A shout went out by a voice crying in the wilderness of Pentecost, "Come out of her, my people." &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of her sins, &gt;&gt; that was a shout that attracted us, &gt;&gt; right? And told us never to be a part of organized religion again. &gt;&gt; It's not talking about your Methodist church, you came from, your Catholic church, you came from, this church, and that. He's talking about organized religion. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come out of her, my people, and be not partakers of her sins and her abominations. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The a shout crying in the wilderness of Pentecost called us in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Babylon is judged. It is fallen. And then comes the shout of the bride. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want you to see this. I'm going to read this quote for you from why I am against organized religion. Notice the 19th chapter in is next. &gt;&gt; Everyone awake. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; buckle your seat belts. &gt;&gt; After these things. That's that's the key there. After these things. After what things? He's reading Revelations 19. That means it's after Revelations 18 and Revelation 17 and Revelation 16. Right? What is Revelation 16? The vials, whatever. Revelation 17, the revelation of the great that sits upon the beast with seven heads and 10 horns. In Revelations 18 is the destruction of that great and the beast. After these things, &gt;&gt; did you notice here in Revelations 19? After these things, watch. After what? After the message of come out of her. After that me, after the message of come out of her, watch is the shout of the bride saints with the bridegroom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Going to the marriage of the lamb. How close are we then, brother? What's the last call? Come out of Babylon. What's the last call? Come out of Babylon. Come out of organized religion. &gt;&gt; Don't come and form a message church and form an organized religion again. &gt;&gt; Come out of her. That's the reason message people are failing. You come out of one system into another system. You put in cold and formalism into the word. You put in radicalism into the word. You make another system. When you come out of a system and you bind people to a system, these are sons of God. They were not bound before the foundation of the world. They were free in him. They had a shout in them. If they shouted in attribute form, there must be a shout in this time. You will not hear a shout. If there's organized religion, because the first shout was, "Come out of her, my people." And after Babylon is destroyed, that is the shout of the bride saints with the bridegroom. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is now. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You want to read Revelation 19:1-7 with me? This is the shout that comes after the shout of come out of her. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you ready? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, looks like I went back to that. Revelations 19 1-7. We'll start 1 to 3. After these things, after what things? destruction of organized religion. I don't want you to ever say that is the Catholic Church and the Vatican and the Methodist and the Baptist and all that because you people make up organized religion. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the organized religion you made up by your free will &gt;&gt; to trap yourself and other people into come out of her. You will only see the fellowship of the mystery manifested in you. You will only have this shout when you come out of that thing. &gt;&gt; Stop blaming denominational people or a previous religion you came from or some other kind of thing. You have to come out of that that needs to be destroyed. &gt;&gt; And there is the shout. Hallelujah. Salvation and glory and all the symbols. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; there's a reality to this. And honor and power unto the Lord our God. Here it is. For true and righteous are his judgments. For he hath judged the great which did corrupt the earth with her fornication and had avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. And again they said hallelujah. And her smoke rose up forever and ever. This is the shout. The first part of the shout is what? The rejoicing. The manifestation that in you is judged the great &gt;&gt; The fellowship of the mystery, the strength of the attribute in you is to break up organized religion. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the mark of the beast. &gt;&gt; You cannot stand it. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you cannot stay in it. You cannot make a new message denomination. &gt;&gt; This attribute will not do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. It will not cluster together because that organized religion spirit is not of the same purpose. &gt;&gt; It cannot speak for God. It cannot stand in this world. It will join itself with fallen angels. &gt;&gt; The first part of the shout is what is that? What is it? It's the revelation the seals. &gt;&gt; What is the exposing and the judgment of the great war which should corrupt the earth with the fornication? That is the exposing the seals. When you break off the religious spirit and the political spirit and the demonic spirit and the paleos rider and the fifth seal and the sixth seal, you are exposing organized religion, you are laying it flat on its back. You are slaughtering it and dissecting it into pieces. It tells you what each spirit is. It tells you religious spirit is a poser, is an impostor. It's religion. It's your prayer life. It's your reading your message books. It's listening to your tapes. It's all the new system you created. It's a white horse rider acting like you're righteous but no faith inside. &gt;&gt; No standing for truth. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; That's the first part of the shout. And the 4 and 20 elders when the 4 and20 elders see that that's the old and new testament. When they see that breaking of organized religion in you, it bows down. &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the New Testament gives up all the types and shadows and reveals everything that you have confessed that you have done. God that sat on the throne saying, "Amen. Hallelujah. Praise be to God." And a voice came out of the throne saying, "Praise our God, all ye servants, and you that fear him both small and great. And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, there it is. Shout, and the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings sing, hallelujah, for the Lord God omnipotence reignth. Here it is. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him, for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready. &gt;&gt; What? So the first part of the shout is the exposing of organized religion, the exposing of the enemy. The second part is they shouted for &gt;&gt; joy. Let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him because what is happening? The second part of the shout is uniting with the word, &gt;&gt; the bridegroom. So you break away from the old system and you come in a perfect union with a revealed word of the hour. That is connecting with sons of God. That is connecting with theophony. That is not religion. There's nothing anyone can reveal to you about that. Nobody's going to show that to you personally. That is something can only happen when you break away completely from every form of system religions. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "This is the shout of the bride and the bridegroom that comes after that." &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come out of her was the prophet's ministry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; After that is the shout of the bride saints and the bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 1-9. We read 1:7. We are the attributes that shouted in the beginning from the foundation of the world. We are the part of the cluster that is called bride and bridegroom because we once shouted in third form when we are manifested on earth. We will find one another. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We will be drawn together because there is now a shout in us. &gt;&gt; The shout has come in his descent. He's brought that book down. There is a shout. That shout revealed the enemy, exposed false religion and and introduced us to our bridegroom. That shout is in us. We live for that. &gt;&gt; We correct ourselves for that every single day. &gt;&gt; Every single day, we feel that conviction inside. I shouldn't do this. I shouldn't do this. This isn't right. Nobody else lives like that. &gt;&gt; Nobody else has the fellowship of the mystery. Those people out there don't even care what happens in their lives. They can drink a beer, wine, whatever without even any conscience problems. They can fornicate. They can do drugs. They can smoke. They can swear. They can curse. They can do everything they want to do. No problem. &gt;&gt; Not you. &gt;&gt; You will torment yourself &gt;&gt; because there is a shout. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something drawing you together. There's a cluster of attributes that are manifested in this day that are connected with a theophony because sons of God are being revealed in this time. What is the shout in us? Praise be to God. If you take that where it says praise be to our God. Let's put it in our language. When it says um let us be glad and rejoice or the previous one, right? We acknowledge the revealing of the seals that has exposed the defeating the defeated enemy. I'm just telling you what it says in our language. You have now rightfully judged where it says you are the righteous and true judge. You have rightfully and true truly judged the immoral spirit of organized religion which corrupted all of human nature. Did you see that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That for true and righteous are your judgments. He had judged the great war which did corrupt the earth with her fornication. Right? There's the first part. We acknowledge your judgment. That means Lord, I believe the revelation of the seven seals completely. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; With all my soul cuz I know it completely judges immoral organized religion. &gt;&gt; I will never be a part of that. &gt;&gt; Right? You have set right what has been done wrong against and it says which had avenged the blood of his servants at her hand. Organized religion has murdered children of God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Not just in real life but also robbed them of happiness. Rob them of things they could have throughout the ages. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal being open has judged her. It's over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And lastly, that last point, let us be glad and rejoice. I challenge any one of you. Don't do it now. Could take out those wonderful phone of yours and Google the meaning of the word rapture. How many think you know what rapture means? Anybody? &gt;&gt; Yes. Not the drug. Joy. &gt;&gt; That's the real meaning of rapture. &gt;&gt; Extreme joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Intense joy that gathers your spirit up into an elated state. That is English. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what rapture actually. Imagine all this time we're going on about rapture being transfiguration, translation, and making doctrines about it. Talk about bodies and all of that. Rapture is extreme joy. &gt;&gt; Extreme joy, intense joy that elates your spirit and makes you rise to a higher dimension. &gt;&gt; That is what existed in the beginning in those attributes that were hidden in him. That was hidden. That cannot be known if you are still stuck in organized religion. Why do you hunger thirst? Why do you fail? Why does the heavenly father is trying to reveal all these mystery secrets to you, but you'll let so many things get these things out of you? This is what the world is trying to do. He's trying to create another Eden for you. Is that right? It's what we spoke about last week. He cannot touch the word. The seven seal has laid it flat. The the seals being open has opened up everything to us. You you cannot give us organized religion again. You cannot force feed that to us. It's not going to happen. The only last thing this enemy has is to produce another Eden. &gt;&gt; A better Eden, &gt;&gt; a nicer life, a better distraction from what? From coming together. &gt;&gt; From the fellowship of the mystery, dividing the brotherhood. That's the last play the enemy has, right? What does the loss play at the at the at the supper table before Christ was crucified? Who should be the one who would betray you? &gt;&gt; Lord, tell us. Is it he? Is it him? &gt;&gt; And he says to them, Peter, feed my sheep. Keep the brotherhood. &gt;&gt; That's your strength. Stay united, stay one. &gt;&gt; What is the enemy going to do? &gt;&gt; He will produce a better Eden for you, a better idea, a better uh form of life, a better way to serve God, a better way to produce the bride, a better way to come to the capstone, a another way to bring forth sons of God, another idea, breaking up the brother. That that's what's happening right now. We are sniping at each other. ministers sniping at each other from pulpits. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Bringing each other down. Why would you do that? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; For us, it means the uniting together of manifested attributes of this day that express the purpose of God that was kept secret through time but revealed in the last days. Verse 8 says, "And to her," that's not there. That is after the shot. And to her, are you ready? was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of saints. &gt;&gt; What is the fine linen you are waiting to be clothed in? Clean and white, which is the righteousness of saints for the rapture. Where is that cloth coming from? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is your theophony. &gt;&gt; That is the sons of God. &gt;&gt; That is the fullness. That is the the the fullness of adoption. That's what you have been predestinated unto. To her was granted that she should receive her theophony. That the bride would be clothed in the theophony she long awaited for. That is the completion of sons. Morning stars sang and sons of God shouted for joy. &gt;&gt; Angels overcame fallen angels. But sons of God manifest the fellowship of the mystery that was hidden God before the foundation of the world. And that is the fellowship of the mystery &gt;&gt; is God becoming man and man becoming God. &gt;&gt; God became man in Jesus Christ. You become theophony which is king theophony. &gt;&gt; God becoming man, man becoming God. There is the mystery. It is only manifested in manifested signs. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads together. Amen.
