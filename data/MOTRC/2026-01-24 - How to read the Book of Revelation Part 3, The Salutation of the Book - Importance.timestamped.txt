[0:00] Good evening saints. Greetings in the
[0:02] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[0:04] Jesus Christ. It is the 30th of March
[0:06] 2022
[0:08] and we're thankful to God for his grace
[0:10] and mercy upon our lives constantly.
[0:14] Third month of the year is just passed
[0:17] and uh time is flying. Things are moving
[0:21] in the world. Uh lots of things
[0:23] happening overseas in our own country.
[0:26] the economic pressures are rising and uh
[0:30] we've been saying this for many years.
[0:32] The events that are taking place uh
[0:35] proving Bible prophecies come to pass
[0:39] but more so in the last few days, the
[0:41] last few months um we have seen more
[0:45] than we've ever seen before
[0:48] and that it is getting closer to the
[0:50] things that the book of Revelations was
[0:52] speaking about. So, it's a very good
[0:54] time for us to be talking about this
[0:56] book, the book of Revelations. And our
[0:58] series is how to read the book of
[1:00] Revelations. Those of you who've been
[1:02] following from the introduction two
[1:03] weeks ago will understand why we are
[1:06] getting into this. So, this is part two,
[1:09] the salutation of the book. And we're
[1:11] going to take our scripture reading from
[1:12] Revelations 1 and verse 4 to 5.
[1:15] Hopefully, we'll deal with just these
[1:17] two verses. actually verse 4 and then
[1:20] one phrase from verse 5. Revelations
[1:24] 1:4-5.
[1:25] John to the seven churches which are in
[1:28] Asia. Grace be unto you and peace from
[1:33] him which is and which was and which is
[1:36] to come and from the seven spirits which
[1:38] are before his throne and from Jesus
[1:42] Christ. The Lord add a blessing to his
[1:45] word.
[1:46] So we said the title will be the
[1:49] salutation of the book and that's what
[1:52] we want to talk about first salutation.
[1:56] Uh this section of the book of
[1:58] revelations is called the salutation of
[2:00] the book. You need to get used to that
[2:02] phrase because it has to be discussed
[2:05] for every church age because there was a
[2:07] salutation for every age.
[2:11] When we think of today, we don't use the
[2:15] word salutation very much. If you ask
[2:18] the French people, they will understand
[2:21] it a little a little bit more in some of
[2:23] the uh languages from Europe probably uh
[2:29] Spanish and Italian and so on because
[2:32] salute means something to them. Whereas
[2:35] today, if you had to use the word salute
[2:38] in South Africa or in the United Kingdom
[2:42] or in America or something like that,
[2:44] you you would generally assume salute
[2:48] means to raise your hand to your
[2:50] forehead to
[2:53] um greet an army officer or something of
[2:56] that because that's what salute has come
[2:59] to mean to us today. But salutation is a
[3:03] greeting.
[3:05] To salute someone means to greet them.
[3:08] And then you think, well, what's such a
[3:10] big deal about that? For us today, a
[3:13] salutation is a friendly hi or hello,
[3:16] how are you?
[3:18] In those days, a salutation was a very
[3:22] important thing, crucial. It was a
[3:25] custom that was so wellkept that if it
[3:28] wasn't done, nobody would pay attention
[3:30] to you or something wouldn't be read
[3:32] because it was deemed unimportant. So if
[3:34] a document did not have a salutation, if
[3:36] a letter did not have a salutation, it
[3:39] was almost an insult to someone. And if
[3:42] it didn't have a salutation, it would be
[3:45] deemed nonconforming to customs at that
[3:49] time and they would just scrap the
[3:50] letter and throw it away. no matter how
[3:52] important something was in there, the
[3:55] salutation was a very important custom.
[3:59] And so that's why it is actually in the
[4:02] beginning of this book of revelations.
[4:05] Uh so in the old days, you couldn't come
[4:09] into a king's palace without bringing
[4:13] salutations. If you didn't have
[4:16] salutations, you would be sent away. And
[4:18] then once you came into the king's
[4:21] court, you would have to be introduced.
[4:26] So you would have to have credentials.
[4:28] So in our days, we say, well, you know,
[4:31] my name is Alistister Francis and here's
[4:33] my ID number and this is who I am, you
[4:36] know. So people are more interested in
[4:38] your identity number
[4:41] um and your name and surname and that
[4:43] seems to be sufficient for people. But
[4:46] in those days it would be
[4:49] uh this is Alistister Francis son of
[4:52] Steven Jennifer Francis and if my
[4:55] parents were some Duke and Duchess or
[4:58] something like that or somebody
[4:59] important or they would say you know
[5:02] Duke and Duchess of some place in
[5:04] Newcastle and owners of this property
[5:07] and um some and all the titles and
[5:11] credentials that they have and then
[5:14] followed by which they would show my
[5:16] credentials and he's of this and this
[5:18] and this background and he owns this and
[5:20] this and this county and this land and
[5:23] this belongs to him there would so the
[5:26] introduction of who I am
[5:29] uh would be a long list of words so that
[5:34] when I come into the king's court he
[5:36] knows exactly who he's speaking to which
[5:39] means just saying Alistister Francis and
[5:42] your ID number is not an identification
[5:45] ation enough when you come and stand
[5:47] before a king. So also when you are
[5:50] producing a document that needs to be
[5:52] read,
[5:53] you need a proper identification because
[5:56] whoever is going to read that document
[5:58] or whoever is going to read whatever it
[6:00] is you wrote or hear what you have to
[6:01] say, they want your background. And of
[6:04] course the reason for that is
[6:07] interpretation of what is read or heard
[6:11] is affected by the revelation of who is
[6:15] writing it or saying it. Right? And
[6:18] that's what's important about this. So
[6:21] in those days it was a custom that was
[6:24] so wellkept
[6:26] uh that if it wasn't done nobody would
[6:28] pay attention to you like we said. And
[6:31] if you brought your document or your
[6:33] book and it had no salutation, they
[6:35] would think this is not important enough
[6:37] because it it doesn't have a salutation.
[6:40] So therefore, it's from somebody who's
[6:42] not really important. So throw it away.
[6:47] But then there were important reasons
[6:49] why those salutations were used as we
[6:51] have just expressed.
[6:53] A salutation tells us two things. And
[6:58] this is why or what we have to focus on
[7:01] right now. Two things. Who the book is
[7:05] addressed to and who the book is from.
[7:08] In other words, so if if we were if we
[7:11] lived in the old days
[7:13] and I met up with you,
[7:17] I would salute you with
[7:21] I Alistister Francis
[7:24] greet you whatever your name is
[7:28] with and I give some description of
[7:31] something in there is identified the
[7:36] sender of the message and the receiver.
[7:38] Eva. So who the book is addressed to and
[7:41] who the book is from.
[7:44] The significance of a salutation
[7:47] in the context of the book of
[7:48] revelation. Right? So without the
[7:50] knowledge or revelation
[7:54] of who is giving out the word or writing
[7:59] the book, it is impossible to properly
[8:03] interpret what is written. So for
[8:06] example, a letter between two people,
[8:09] okay? A letter between a husband and
[8:12] wife or between two friends.
[8:16] That letter will consist of things that
[8:18] only the sender and the receiver can
[8:20] properly understand. Now you may read a
[8:22] letter between a husband and a wife or
[8:25] between two friends and you will gather
[8:27] some things that you'll understand. But
[8:30] the there's greater meaning the
[8:32] intentions
[8:34] the the inonations of the c of the way
[8:38] it is spoken. You will not know
[8:41] significant details that gives you the
[8:45] actual message in the mind of the
[8:48] person. You will not be able to grasp
[8:49] that. What you will do is you will
[8:52] interpret those words from your point of
[8:54] view and most likely will misinterpret
[8:57] the words altogether.
[8:59] You remember the prophet saying that
[9:01] when he received a letter from his wife
[9:03] while he was abroad
[9:06] and he read what she had to say and he
[9:09] could understand his wife's letters
[9:11] properly. He said if you read it you
[9:14] wouldn't know what she's saying but
[9:15] because I know her he said I could read
[9:18] between the lines.
[9:21] So the sender will write things
[9:25] specifically for the receiver to
[9:27] understand. Why is that important?
[9:28] Because when a letter in the old days
[9:32] was addressed to somebody and it was
[9:34] spoken of who it was from,
[9:38] um,
[9:40] anyone who's delivering the letter could
[9:44] open that letter up, crack open the
[9:46] seal, look at the letter, read it, and
[9:50] know what was going on. But if
[9:55] the sender and receiver were properly
[9:59] identified, anyone who reads the letter
[10:02] knows that the only way they're going to
[10:05] get the proper message or the proper
[10:06] intention or the proper result is if
[10:09] this letter reaches the receiver who was
[10:13] addressed in there. And that would mean
[10:16] that that's the only time the revelation
[10:18] of it all will be made known.
[10:21] So the sender will write things
[10:24] specifically for the receiver to
[10:26] understand. Because the receiver knows
[10:29] the sender so well, he or she will never
[10:32] misinterpret anything and will totally
[10:34] understand everything. The book of
[10:37] revelations is then written in a way
[10:40] that only those who have a revelation of
[10:43] the saluter will understand. Amen. So
[10:47] that being said, it means this.
[10:51] Those who read the book of revelations
[10:53] and know who the writer is, who
[10:55] understand, who have a revelation of
[10:57] Christ, only they will properly
[11:00] understand the book of revelations.
[11:03] Nobody else.
[11:05] It is impossible to understand
[11:08] unless you get into the spirit of the
[11:10] writer. And you know, if you study
[11:13] English poetry or literature, they teach
[11:16] you that, you know, you've got to
[11:18] research the writer. If you if you're
[11:20] studying Shakespeare or you know
[11:25] some some writer from the past
[11:28] uh and you have to study the person
[11:33] the conditions of the time they were
[11:35] writing from
[11:37] the conditions of and experiences that
[11:42] prompted that person to write those very
[11:44] things. In the study of literature, they
[11:48] expect you to do that research to be
[11:50] able to understand
[11:52] why they wrote what they wrote. So that
[11:57] is what is called getting into the
[11:58] spirit of the writer. It is very
[12:01] important to understand the purpose for
[12:03] the salutation because like we said
[12:06] every age of the church begins with a
[12:08] salutation to the age. You'll see that
[12:10] unto the church of Ephesus write these
[12:11] things saith he that that's called a
[12:14] salutation that identifies the church
[12:17] and the sender. A salutation
[12:21] invokes the attention of the reader or
[12:25] the receivers of the word to look at the
[12:28] written or spoken word from the
[12:30] direction of the salutation. That means
[12:33] what is most important is
[12:35] [clears throat]
[12:37] you could read let's say you read the
[12:40] message that was sent to Ephesus and
[12:43] you're here in Leodysia
[12:45] you're never going to understand
[12:48] what was meant
[12:50] what message was transferred to the the
[12:53] church age of Ephesus unless you begin
[12:56] with the salutation and see what
[12:59] anointing the spirit is invoking king.
[13:03] If he says, "These things saith he who
[13:05] had the sword in his hand, or the sword
[13:07] comes out of his mouth, or these things
[13:09] sayith he who had the seven stars in his
[13:11] hand, or these things say he," then what
[13:13] he's saying is you need to read this
[13:15] message knowing that
[13:19] I am the one who has the seven stars or
[13:22] I am anointing this age with this
[13:25] particular anointing.
[13:29] So if you don't read that message with
[13:33] that particular anointing, you are not
[13:35] going to get the correct understanding
[13:38] that he was going to give to that age. I
[13:42] hope that's easy to understand.
[13:44] All right. So let's get to the breakdown
[13:46] of the salutation.
[13:49] In verses 4 to 5, we see firstly
[13:53] there are two salutations to the seven
[13:56] churches from what seems like four
[14:00] different sources or people who are
[14:04] saluting,
[14:06] right? Two different salutations
[14:08] to the seven churches and from what
[14:11] seems like four different sources. And
[14:14] we'll explain that just now. You'll also
[14:16] see in verses 4 to 5 three major ands a
[14:21] n ds. Now you know the word and is a
[14:24] conjunction.
[14:26] What a conjunction does is it joins two
[14:29] different sentences to make one sentence
[14:31] in English. So what we're saying is uh
[14:36] there are three major ants. They're very
[14:39] very important and then there are five
[14:41] minor ones which are not exactly
[14:43] important. Right? And we're going to
[14:45] look at those three major ends. So let
[14:47] me just give you an example. If I read
[14:50] the verses there, it says John to the
[14:52] seven churches which are in Asia. Grace
[14:54] be unto you. And there's your first
[14:57] major and
[14:59] so it's and peace from him which is
[15:03] here's a minor end. And which was and
[15:06] which is to come. Now here's a major
[15:08] end. And from the seven spirits which
[15:11] are before his throne.
[15:13] and verse five and another major and
[15:16] from Jesus Christ. So if you read
[15:19] further on in verse five, you'll see all
[15:21] the other minor ends. But basically what
[15:24] this is doing is separating
[15:28] four things, four sources or people.
[15:31] These three major ants are joining
[15:36] four uh sources of people who are
[15:39] bringing salutations. people or four
[15:42] sources. Right?
[15:44] So to read it out plainly to you, it
[15:47] says, "Grace be unto you, which seems to
[15:49] be from John
[15:52] and peace from he which was and is and
[15:57] is to come and from the seven spirits
[16:00] before the throne and from Jesus
[16:03] Christ."
[16:04] Right? So this is very important and
[16:08] we're going to pick that up just now. So
[16:10] remember that. Now we get to the next
[16:14] point. Uh we want to pass by this.
[16:17] That's why we're doing this first. Who
[16:19] the book is to. And you find there in
[16:22] verse four, it is to the seven churches
[16:26] which are in Asia. Now what does that
[16:29] mean? Okay. So these are the seven
[16:32] cities of Asia Minor. This is not Asia
[16:36] that we know of today. that would have
[16:39] probably been called Asia major. So Asia
[16:43] would be China and um India and Japan,
[16:48] Pakistan and some of those countries
[16:51] that are in this massive continent that
[16:53] which we call Asia today. But Asia Minor
[16:57] was the absolute western part of Asia
[17:01] and was a small section which today we
[17:03] call the country of Turkey. And in there
[17:07] were many cities, many important cities
[17:09] including Nika.
[17:11] But the seven cities that John was
[17:15] inspired to speak to were Ephesus,
[17:18] Smyrna, Pergamus, Thotyra, Sardis,
[17:21] Philadelphia, and Leodysia. They were
[17:23] spelled slightly different like
[17:25] Pergamon, not exactly Pergamus.
[17:29] Uh so and some of them were just as they
[17:32] are in the book of Revelation
[17:34] historically.
[17:36] There were churches there were churches
[17:39] within these cities which
[17:42] were known by John and they were
[17:45] significant symbols of the growth of the
[17:49] church
[17:50] through the ages that were to come right
[17:53] and that's why they were used. So these
[17:55] churches were chosen as symbols by
[17:58] Christ because they had characteristics
[18:01] that were going to accurately manifest
[18:04] the effect of the seed of the word being
[18:06] planted. Remember what we told you, the
[18:08] book of Revelation is a map. It's it's a
[18:12] guideline of all that would occur when
[18:16] the seed of Christ is planted in
[18:18] anything, the world, the church, a
[18:21] human. It tells exactly what is going to
[18:24] happen as in how it will begin, what the
[18:29] the road map will be, what the enemies
[18:31] will be, what um the positives will be,
[18:35] what the negatives will be, what will
[18:37] come against them, how there'll be
[18:39] redemption, all of that. It's the road
[18:41] map. All right? So these seven churches
[18:44] were chosen
[18:46] as symbols
[18:48] that were included in the road map of
[18:51] the church in the growth of the church.
[18:54] How the church would begin, how it would
[18:57] progress, how it would digress, how it
[18:59] would come to the judgment, how it would
[19:01] be restored in the end. All right? So
[19:03] bear that in mind. So who is it to? the
[19:06] seven churches in Asia or rather the
[19:09] seven church ages of the gentile
[19:12] dispensation.
[19:14] That's the revelation of the symbols.
[19:16] Now we get to you know the the greeting
[19:20] is simply grace
[19:23] and peace.
[19:25] Right? So grace seems to be the
[19:29] greetings from John to the seven church
[19:32] ages. grace and peace from
[19:36] right from the next three sources.
[19:41] So it is important to notice that John
[19:43] spent only one verse not even one verse
[19:47] like uh one phrase as a greeting from
[19:50] himself. The majority of the greeting is
[19:53] from Christ in the following verses. And
[19:56] you're going to see that probably next
[19:58] week when we get through the rest of
[20:00] verse 5, 6, 7, and 8. So grace in this
[20:05] context means good tidings or well
[20:09] wishes. So John is saying to the seven
[20:11] churches in Asia, I wish you good
[20:14] tidings or or well wishes to you. And
[20:20] then he says and peace right that and in
[20:25] between grace and peace is a major and
[20:27] because it is grace from John and peace
[20:30] from whoever is coming after that right
[20:33] so peace is a beautiful part of this
[20:38] salutation. Peace means harmony or
[20:42] balance. Now who would greet someone
[20:46] with peace today? I mean, you walk
[20:48] around and you meet a brother from the
[20:50] church and you stand there and say,
[20:54] "Hey, brother John, peace." Oh, brother
[20:57] Peter, peace. You know, peace to you.
[21:01] And they'll look at you weirdly because
[21:03] nobody walks around saying that
[21:05] nowadays. However, if you walked around
[21:07] and said shalom,
[21:10] the message believers would probably
[21:11] understand what you mean. They'll say,
[21:13] they'll think you're coming from the
[21:14] context of a message, shalom, spoken by
[21:16] the prophet. Other people were hearing
[21:18] you thinking, hm. If they looked at me
[21:21] saying shalom, they they'd see an Indian
[21:23] man. They'll say, hm, an Indian man
[21:25] using a Jewish
[21:27] uh greeting. That's weird. These people
[21:29] are weird. Let's move on. Uh, nobody
[21:33] does that anymore. Peace. Shalom. You
[21:36] find amongst the Muslim people, they say
[21:39] salam.
[21:41] and uh they're so used to it. It's
[21:42] tradition, but it's so useless with
[21:46] Muslim people because they it's just a
[21:49] greeting. It's just salam to them is a
[21:51] high hello. I I actually hear some of
[21:54] them casually just saying salams, you
[21:56] know, and it's the meaning of that has
[22:00] been lost to them. uh and it's it was a
[22:04] thing of the east like you will find
[22:06] amongst the Indians they put depending
[22:09] on whether they Tamil or Hindi or
[22:11] whatever they put their hands together
[22:14] they bring it together in front of their
[22:16] chest and they say namaste or namaskarum
[22:19] in the different Indian languages
[22:22] and uh again the people of this world
[22:26] this modern world do it all the time
[22:28] namaste namaskarum but they have no idea
[22:31] what it actually means means to them
[22:33] it's just a greeting. Originally
[22:36] those words namaste, namaskarum, salam,
[22:39] shalom. They come from the eastern world
[22:43] which meant one thing. It means let our
[22:47] minds come together. That was a greeting
[22:51] between people. Let our minds come
[22:52] together. Now this was
[22:58] again something that
[23:01] is written in the Bible and when you
[23:03] read that I I guarantee you how many
[23:05] times you've read that scripture and you
[23:06] pass over that peace from he which is
[23:09] which was and which is to come and you
[23:11] pass by oh right he said peace fantastic
[23:13] you know whatever that is I believe that
[23:17] John was giving the most important
[23:19] salutation from the author
[23:22] peace is Not just harmony or balance.
[23:25] That's us interpreting peace. If I ask
[23:29] you what peace means, you would say,
[23:31] well, it means no war, no fighting. It
[23:34] means I come in peace. What does that
[23:37] mean? You know, that's doesn't mean
[23:40] anything. I come in peace. What were you
[23:42] expecting you to come fighting with a
[23:45] bow and arrow or a spear and a sword?
[23:47] What do you mean by in those days peace
[23:51] meant I am one with you let our minds
[23:55] come together let us be of one mind
[23:58] right that was oneness
[24:02] it's what we call oneness and that
[24:05] oneness that I am one with you I mean
[24:08] could there be anything greater than he
[24:11] which was which is and which is to come
[24:13] sending you a message of greetings
[24:15] saying I am one with You can you see the
[24:18] greatness of that?
[24:21] That oneness, that unity was brought by
[24:24] the Holy Ghost. We know that that means
[24:26] a lot a whole lot of things to us,
[24:28] right? But mostly that there would be a
[24:30] rest given to the true believer who
[24:33] received the Holy Ghost. Why rest?
[24:35] Because for a long time, humans were not
[24:37] one with God. They were not one mind
[24:40] with God. They were of two minds
[24:42] constantly. But if this salutation says
[24:46] peace
[24:48] it the from the sender he's saying I
[24:51] understand you. I'm with you. I I am
[24:56] witnessing everything that happens to
[24:58] you. I uh am experiencing everything
[25:01] that you go through. Peace. We are of
[25:04] one mind. We are one. We are together in
[25:06] this. We are united.
[25:09] The Holy Ghost is the salutation of
[25:12] peace from Christ to any believer.
[25:16] Then John expresses where the salutation
[25:20] of peace is coming from. Okay. So now we
[25:22] get to the four sources of the
[25:25] salutation that means where the people
[25:28] that these salutations are coming from.
[25:31] The first one we get to is John himself.
[25:35] So verse four opens up with the name
[25:37] John. John to the seven churches. Right?
[25:40] He this phrase identifies John as the
[25:43] scribe who is saluting the seven
[25:45] churches. It is important that the book
[25:47] indicates that John was the scribe of
[25:49] this book. He's f he first expresses
[25:52] greetings from himself
[25:55] but then he's invoking the blessings of
[25:58] the revelation of Jesus as manifested on
[26:00] earth and in heaven. Right? That's what
[26:02] we're seeing. You'll see those. The next
[26:05] three sources are indications of Jesus
[26:09] in earth and in heaven. So is John that
[26:12] important for the salutation?
[26:15] I mean why does why is his name
[26:17] important there? Is it important at all?
[26:20] Absolutely yes. Why? Because John is the
[26:23] one who wrote what he saw in the
[26:26] visions. We have to understand him. When
[26:29] you read the book of Revelations, you
[26:31] have to understand John. You have to
[26:34] read the book of John. You have to read
[26:36] the gospels of John. Uh the writings of
[26:38] John, the books of John. You need to
[26:40] know where he is coming from. What was
[26:42] his own personal anointing? Because his
[26:45] own personal anointing affected how he
[26:48] wrote what he saw. It's very important
[26:50] that you know who John is and everything
[26:53] there is to know about him or as much as
[26:55] you can. Right? As we explained before,
[26:59] what John saw was not necessarily things
[27:02] that he was used to at his time because
[27:05] he was seeing things of the future which
[27:07] had not happened yet or not even been
[27:10] invented yet. He was seeing governments,
[27:13] parliaments, churches,
[27:16] uh world wars, plagues which never
[27:20] occurred, viruses which they had never
[27:22] discovered. He was seeing uh machines
[27:27] that sailed the seas, that flew in the
[27:29] air, that moved in the ground. He saw
[27:32] things he never understood, right? I
[27:34] mean, kind of like brother Brandham in
[27:35] his day who was describing an egg-shaped
[27:38] car with driverless with, you know, kids
[27:43] playing a board game on the inside or
[27:45] something that never occurred yet in the
[27:47] prophet's day. So, he couldn't tell you
[27:48] exact exactly what it is. But when he
[27:51] said an eggshaped car, you know, we
[27:54] don't even realize what he meant from
[27:56] that. From that, he could have just
[27:58] meant this car was so rounded because
[28:00] all the cars in brother Brandham's day
[28:02] was were very box-like, square and
[28:05] angular. And yet, when you look at the
[28:08] cars in our day, they're all so round
[28:10] and aerodynamic and curvy and, you know,
[28:14] it's and and maybe that's all he meant.
[28:17] But we went around looking for not we
[28:20] the people who who read that went around
[28:22] looking for a literal car shaped like a
[28:24] literal oval and it's throwing you off
[28:28] when you try to do things that you're
[28:30] not spending time to understand the
[28:33] times and conditions from when something
[28:34] was spoken. Um, so it's very important
[28:39] when God shows a prophet a vision like
[28:41] when he said a woman will rule America
[28:43] and then he thought it was an actual
[28:45] woman and then as time went on he he
[28:47] said it may not be an actual woman it
[28:49] may actually be the church the the
[28:51] Catholic church or it may be a system or
[28:54] something like that right so it's very
[28:56] very important to know the writer so
[29:02] um it's important because what he knew
[29:06] of in his time was not necessarily what
[29:09] he understood of things that were going
[29:10] to happen because he wrote it and
[29:13] because he wrote it, we are able to
[29:15] understand it because we know him,
[29:18] right? Also, what's important is
[29:21] noticing John's attitude to the visions.
[29:25] His attitude to each vision shows us the
[29:28] anointing and his reaction
[29:31] uh to it. And by seeing his anointing
[29:34] and his reaction, it shows us
[29:38] what anointing and reaction we ought to
[29:40] have to the same visions because he
[29:45] symbolizes us, the bride. He's not the
[29:48] most important in the salutation because
[29:50] the thoughts are not his, but he
[29:52] symbolizes us, the bride. Therefore, he
[29:55] is significant to us. Right? He was the
[29:58] one honored to receive the revelation of
[30:01] Jesus Christ in symbol form. This book
[30:04] is a book of symbols. Revelations book
[30:07] of symbols because
[30:09] Jesus loved him the most and preserved
[30:12] him to show him these secrets. Now you
[30:14] can read in just one uh chapter and a
[30:17] few verses John 13:21-29.
[30:20] You can see how um when Jesus says
[30:23] something at the supper table and it
[30:25] disturbs him and Peter says, you know,
[30:27] who is it that he's talking about and
[30:29] the disciples are looking around at
[30:31] themselves and then Peter gets the idea,
[30:33] why not ask John? Because clearly
[30:35] there's some there's a extra care
[30:39] between Jesus and John. John was the
[30:42] youngest of all the disciples. He could
[30:44] have been a 19 or 20 year old considered
[30:47] a child whom Jesus showed special care
[30:50] for. He was, you know, for example, he
[30:52] could have been like Jesus's Sunday
[30:54] school. Um, he lay very close to Jesus
[30:57] at supper and he was able to ask the
[31:01] thoughts that were troubling Jesus and
[31:03] he dulged them to John. So Peter
[31:07] whispers to John to say, "Ask him who
[31:09] he's talking about." John asks him flat
[31:11] out who he's asking about. And then
[31:13] Jesus gives this statement, he who dips
[31:16] his uh um bread in the soap with or dips
[31:21] in the soap with me at the same time
[31:22] that I do so and so on. So this
[31:26] understanding of who John is is crucial
[31:30] to us because that's the relationship we
[31:34] ought to have with the word. That's
[31:36] telling us that when there's something
[31:38] that comes forth from the mysteries of
[31:40] God, if you are not one who lays on his
[31:43] bosom, you cannot ask him the most
[31:46] intimate questions. And when you're a
[31:49] reader, don't expect to understand
[31:51] revelation if you don't have an intimate
[31:53] revelation of Christ. Amen. So that's
[31:57] why John is important to us as the first
[32:00] source of salutation. Now the next part
[32:02] is one that will baffle trinitarians,
[32:05] right? Because you could say the
[32:08] salutation come from John and then it
[32:10] comes from the father, the son, and the
[32:11] holy ghost. Now, why does this
[32:14] salutation look like it come from three
[32:16] different people or
[32:19] 11 different people in heaven?
[32:22] Why you say 11? Well, it says he which
[32:25] was that could be one person. He which
[32:27] is that could be another. He which is to
[32:30] come that could be another then seven
[32:32] spirits before the throne 3 + 7 is 10
[32:36] and then from Jesus Christ that's 11 so
[32:39] is that from 11 different people
[32:43] right so he which is which was and is to
[32:48] come and from seven spirits before the
[32:51] throne and from Jesus Christ do you see
[32:54] how easy it is for someone who doesn't
[32:56] know the author to make this from many
[33:00] people, many sources, many entities,
[33:04] right? The truth is those who know him
[33:07] well understand these are not different
[33:10] people but different manifestations of
[33:14] the same person over different times and
[33:18] seasons.
[33:20] Now, what this tells us is that only
[33:23] those with the correct understanding of
[33:25] Godhead can interpret this book
[33:27] correctly. So there's another starting
[33:29] point. You need to understand the
[33:31] godhead properly before you get into
[33:33] this. When you start hearing things like
[33:34] the father, uh he who sits on the white
[33:37] horse, the true and faithful witness, um
[33:41] the son,
[33:43] the mighty angel descending, and you
[33:45] don't have an understanding of godhead,
[33:47] you could easily make this two lords,
[33:50] three lords,
[33:52] three personalities in a godhead. Right?
[33:56] The most important clue that the three
[33:59] sources of salutation which come after
[34:01] John are the same person is that they
[34:05] all have the same salutation.
[34:07] Peace.
[34:09] That tells us who it was because Christ
[34:12] left
[34:14] uh earth saying this to the disciples.
[34:16] John 14:26-27.
[34:19] But the comforter which is the Holy
[34:20] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[34:22] name. He shall teach you all things and
[34:24] bring all things to your remembrance.
[34:27] Whatsoever I have said unto you. Peace I
[34:31] leave with you. My peace I give unto
[34:34] you. Not as the world giveth, give I
[34:38] unto you. Let not your heart be
[34:41] troubled. Amen. So this is literally
[34:44] saying that the peace that the world
[34:46] gives does not compare. Right? So peace
[34:50] now we want to talk about it. We said
[34:51] some a little bit about it earlier.
[34:54] Peace or shalom
[34:56] is a mystery that nobody understands
[34:59] today. And I'm I'm
[35:02] I'm 100% on this that all the Eastern
[35:05] people of the world who use the phrases
[35:07] today have lost the effect of what that
[35:10] means. How do I know? Because people
[35:12] greet one another with shalom salam and
[35:15] they hate one another. They greet them
[35:18] each other with namaste, namaskarum, all
[35:20] the eastern uh words and they hate one
[35:24] another. They despise one another. They
[35:25] think evil of one another. If you say
[35:28] peace to somebody, you are saying
[35:32] let our minds be united. You are saying
[35:35] we are one. That's what you're saying.
[35:38] It's a greeting among all Abrahamic
[35:40] religions. But the significance has been
[35:42] lost on them. 4,000 years ago when they
[35:45] greeted each other with greetings of
[35:46] peace, it meant let our minds be united.
[35:50] In other words, we are one. But among
[35:53] men, that was only a promise. So even
[35:56] though they used it from 4,000 years
[35:58] ago, it was only a promise. Like let's
[36:00] say when Abraham met with Lot, I'm just
[36:04] giving you an example. probably didn't
[36:06] happen. But let's say they met after
[36:09] maybe 7 weeks of not seeing each other
[36:11] and they say to each other, "Shalom or
[36:13] peace." Right? At at that moment, those
[36:17] two men were disagreeable because one
[36:20] went and took the plains of Jordan and
[36:22] the other one went in the other
[36:24] direction after having split up and you
[36:27] know um agreeing not to be a part of one
[36:30] another's uh group anymore. They were
[36:33] dis they were in disagreement. So when
[36:34] they came together and they both greeted
[36:37] each other with shalom or peace, they
[36:40] were saying
[36:41] let us hope to be of one accord in this
[36:45] meeting. Let us attempt, let us
[36:48] persevere to be one in spirit so that we
[36:52] can understand each other. So to them to
[36:55] among men, it was a promise
[36:58] like a like a a promise being made to
[37:00] one another to do their best to reach an
[37:03] agreement. Get it? So that's why when
[37:06] Christ said a peace the world could not
[37:09] give. I'm giving you peace that the
[37:12] world could not give. That's because
[37:13] Christ is not making a a promise of an
[37:16] attempt. He's telling you, I'm giving
[37:19] you peace. I'm giving you something
[37:22] that's literally going to make us one.
[37:25] Literally something that is going to put
[37:27] us in one mind. And he identifies it. He
[37:30] says it's the comforter. It's the Holy
[37:32] Ghost. That peace comes from Christ.
[37:34] That is the Holy Ghost. That could
[37:36] literally baptize a person into the
[37:38] oneness of spirit into one body,
[37:42] right? So that a body of people could be
[37:45] so united with the spirit of Christ,
[37:47] they would understand and believe the
[37:50] word of Christ. Amen. So peace is the
[37:53] oneness of God, the unity of God. The
[37:58] unity meaning of many membered body
[38:01] becoming one in revelation in
[38:04] understanding the true revelation of the
[38:07] godhead. That's what the peace of God
[38:10] is.
[38:11] So uh we reach the second uh source of
[38:16] the salutation.
[38:18] He which is and which was and which is
[38:21] to come. This is just beautiful. He
[38:24] which is and which was and which is to
[38:26] come. Basically this is the revelation
[38:29] of the word himself
[38:32] expressed through time. Hebrews 13:8
[38:37] Jesus Christ the same yesterday that's
[38:39] he which was today he which is and he
[38:42] which is to come forever. Jesus Christ
[38:44] is the same yesterday today and forever
[38:46] past present and future. This is the
[38:49] revelation of the godhead. The father
[38:52] was Christ is the holy ghost is to come.
[38:57] This is the revelation of Christ
[38:59] himself. The first coming was the Holy
[39:03] Ghost is the second coming is to come.
[39:07] Right? That was how they saw it in the
[39:09] church ages. Then there is the
[39:10] revelation of the Messiah. Son of man
[39:13] was son of God is if you're standing in
[39:16] the church ages and son of David is to
[39:19] come for the millennium. This is also
[39:21] the revelation of God above was
[39:25] Emmanuel. God with us is present and God
[39:29] in us which would be the future if you
[39:32] were standing in the church ages. This
[39:34] is also the revelation of St. John
[39:36] 14:20. The father in me, I in you or the
[39:41] father in me, I in the father, I in you,
[39:43] you in me. It is unity, peace, harmony.
[39:48] It is shalom.
[39:50] This is also a phrase that wherever you
[39:52] are in the gentile ages of time, you can
[39:55] relate to the Lord Jesus who was, is,
[39:58] and is to come. In Paul's day,
[40:02] was was the word of the apostles. He was
[40:05] trying to kill. Paul himself was trying
[40:07] to kill, right? Is became the word of
[40:11] Paul's day, which came through Paul
[40:13] himself. And is to come was the word
[40:15] that was going to come in Ireneius's
[40:17] day. In Wesley's day, if Wesley
[40:20] [clears throat] was standing there and
[40:21] thinking, well, he which was that would
[40:24] be Luther. He which is is the word
[40:26] through Wesley and he that is to come
[40:29] the word of the seventh messenger.
[40:31] Right? If you were standing in Wesley's
[40:33] day. So also in your personal life, you
[40:36] can identify the word himself in your
[40:39] past, the word in your present, the word
[40:42] in your future. That is what called you,
[40:46] what is sustaining you right now and
[40:48] what you will become when you fulfill
[40:50] the fullness of the word for your day.
[40:52] That means every single believer has a
[40:56] way of interpreting or has a viewpoint
[40:59] of he which is which was and is to come.
[41:04] Glory to God. Amen.
[41:06] Then we get to the third one which is
[41:08] the seven spirits before the throne.
[41:10] These are the seven anointings that will
[41:12] bring the influence to the seven
[41:15] messengers over the seven church ages of
[41:18] the gentile dispensation.
[41:21] Right? Uh so you you understand what
[41:24] that means, right? Those messengers were
[41:26] just men. Um they had their flaws. They
[41:29] had their mistakes. But these seven
[41:31] spirits before the throne would be
[41:33] anointings of Christ himself that would
[41:37] anoint each messengers. Now these seven
[41:39] anointings will influence the messengers
[41:42] with characteristics of the seven-fold
[41:45] glory of the person of Christ which we
[41:46] will talk about in a few services to
[41:49] come and the the that the revelation of
[41:52] that sevenfold glory of that person if
[41:54] it was onefold of it coming to one
[41:56] messenger it would give that messenger a
[41:59] particular ability to face the challenge
[42:02] of that age and deliver the revelation
[42:04] of the day to the people.
[42:08] Right? So these seven spirits before the
[42:11] throne are not seven separate angels
[42:14] that are not Jesus Christ. They are
[42:17] anointings spirits the angels of Jesus
[42:21] Christ himself. Angel is a messenger of
[42:24] a particular thing. Right? So
[42:27] you can read here in the revelation of
[42:29] Jesus Christ that is your church age
[42:31] book uh page 17 paragraph 3. He says,
[42:35] "The seven spirits before the throne is
[42:37] the spirit that was in each of the seven
[42:41] messengers, giving them their ministries
[42:44] for the age in which each lived." On
[42:47] page 248, paragraph 5, Sardisan church
[42:50] age, he says, "Thus we know that the
[42:52] seven spirits of God mean it is the one
[42:55] and same spirit coming forth in a
[42:58] sevenfold way. These seven spirits are
[43:02] found to be associated with man. On page
[43:06] 250, paragraph 2, Sardis and George. So
[43:10] we see that the seven spirits actually
[43:14] refer to the one spirit of God working
[43:18] out the will and word of God in
[43:21] different generations. See, I didn't
[43:24] make that up. It's exactly what the
[43:26] messenger said. All right, so we clear
[43:28] that up. It's not seven different
[43:31] people. It's one spirit broken up into
[43:34] seven manifestations over seven church
[43:36] ages through seven messengers. There it
[43:39] is. Now think about that. You are being
[43:42] saluted
[43:43] from that manifestation. What does that
[43:46] mean? You can't read the book of
[43:49] Revelations without understanding that.
[43:51] You have to read the book of Revelations
[43:53] with that direction of thought of those
[43:58] seven anointings. Okay.
[44:00] And you know, I might as well give you
[44:02] the spoiler.
[44:04] You'll find all the mysteries of God in
[44:06] the book of Revelations
[44:09] are separated into sevens. Seven church
[44:12] ages, seven trumpets, seven vials, seven
[44:15] seals, seven thunders, right? Major
[44:19] doctrines
[44:20] in the Old Testament. Seven feasts and
[44:23] more and more sevens. So, we're not
[44:26] making things up. Seven golden
[44:28] candlesticks, seven stars in his right
[44:30] hand, seven spirits before the throne,
[44:32] lamp lamps burning before the throne,
[44:34] seven candlesticks in the time of Moses,
[44:38] uh seven eyes moving uh through the
[44:42] earth in Zechariah. It's all their
[44:44] sense, right? It's it's not something we
[44:47] made up.
[44:49] So number four brings us to the end,
[44:53] Jesus Christ. So peace be unto you from
[44:57] or peace from he which is he which was
[44:59] and and which is to come and from the
[45:02] seven spirits of God before the throne
[45:03] and from Jesus Christ. And to me this is
[45:07] the most beautiful
[45:09] salutation coming from the most
[45:12] beautiful expression of God himself the
[45:15] Lord Jesus Christ. What does it mean to
[45:18] us? Now the usual reflex is oh yes
[45:21] everyone knows this. Jesus Christ is the
[45:23] Lord who came 2,000 years ago. Glory to
[45:25] God. He crucified on on Calvary, shed
[45:28] his blood for our sins. Praise be to God
[45:30] for Jesus so loved the world, you know,
[45:33] and oh, God so loved the world, he gave
[45:34] his only son and so on and so on. In
[45:37] Revelations, book of symbols.
[45:40] Jesus is not just a person. He is a
[45:44] symbol of something. He's not just the
[45:46] one who died 2,000 years ago. Jesus
[45:49] Christ represents not just one person in
[45:53] history but a particular manifestation.
[45:58] What is the revelation of Jesus Christ?
[46:01] Right? Look, we broke down which is
[46:03] which was which is to come. We broke
[46:05] down seven spurs before the throne. How
[46:07] do we break down Jesus Christ? What is
[46:10] Jesus Christ?
[46:13] a particular manifestation
[46:16] that nothing else has ever manifested in
[46:19] the history of man in the history of
[46:22] what we know of as God. Jesus Christ
[46:26] represents
[46:27] the word made flesh, born of a woman and
[46:32] dwelling among men. John 1:14, the word
[46:36] was made flesh and dwelt among us. Amen.
[46:40] Now we know the word was made flesh in
[46:42] Abraham's day and that was called
[46:44] Melchisedc. That was a different
[46:46] manifestation of God of the same God.
[46:48] But he was not called the son. He was
[46:50] MelkiseDC. He was not born of a woman.
[46:54] Right? Jesus Christ represents the
[46:56] manifestation of the word in flesh that
[46:59] was born not of the will of man but of
[47:03] God and born of a woman.
[47:06] This is why it's so important to us,
[47:08] right? Jesus Christ represents he who
[47:12] would bring many sons like unto himself.
[47:17] Amen. That they may also be Jesus Christ
[47:20] in their day. What? What? Yes. That they
[47:24] may also be the word made flesh, born of
[47:26] a woman, not of the will of man, but of
[47:28] the will of God. That's what Jesus
[47:30] Christ represents.
[47:32] And so, he would be the Christ in their
[47:35] day, right? would bring sons like unto
[47:38] himself, that they may also be Christ in
[47:40] their day according to their measure,
[47:43] until there would come a day where they
[47:45] would be fully adopted sons who would be
[47:48] fully Jesus Christ in the last day, the
[47:52] full stature of that perfect man.
[47:57] Then Jesus Christ also represents Adam
[48:01] who was the beginning of a new race. Who
[48:04] was Adam? Adam was made up of two parts.
[48:07] A masculine part and a feminine part. Is
[48:10] that right? Let us make man in our
[48:11] image. And he made man male and female.
[48:13] Male and female created he them in the
[48:15] day that they were created. And he
[48:16] called their name Adam. You remember
[48:17] that? That's just mixing up several
[48:20] scriptures. In the first Adam, he was
[48:22] created male and female in the day that
[48:25] they were created. And they were both
[48:26] called Adam. Both male and female were
[48:29] called Adam. They were then separated in
[48:32] Genesis 2 when Adam was made flesh and
[48:35] she was called woman because she came
[48:38] out of man. But she was still called
[48:42] Adam. Her name was called Adam. Right?
[48:45] When she fell because of sin, she
[48:48] received a new identification. She was
[48:50] no longer called Adam. She was called
[48:52] Eve, the mother of all living. She lost
[48:56] the name Adam. She needed restoration.
[49:01] In the second Adam, he was born Jesus
[49:04] Christ having the potentials of his
[49:07] bride in him. At Calvary, he shed his
[49:11] blood so that his seed could be released
[49:14] upon the Gentiles to gather his bride to
[49:17] him. She was already fallen before she
[49:20] knew him, and she was called sinners.
[49:24] But when she was gathered from all
[49:26] kindreds, nations, tongues, and peoples
[49:28] by the blood, by the Holy Ghost, and a
[49:31] portion of the word for her for that
[49:33] day, she was called church, the church.
[49:38] But the promise was that in the last
[49:41] days, he would return with the full
[49:44] word. He would return with the full word
[49:49] and unite with the perfect church that
[49:51] is the bride. And she would be called
[49:54] Jesus Christ. Just like the original
[49:58] feminine part of Adam was called Adam.
[50:01] This second Adam, she would be called
[50:03] Jesus Christ. What is that? The word
[50:05] made flesh, born of a woman, not of the
[50:09] will of man, but of the will of God and
[50:11] dwelling among men. That's what it means
[50:14] to be Jesus Christ. That is the coming
[50:17] of Jesus Christ.
[50:20] You cannot read this book of revelations
[50:22] without understanding and accepting
[50:26] that revelation of who Jesus Christ is.
[50:30] No one who reads the book of revelations
[50:32] without this understanding of who
[50:34] salutes the churches will properly
[50:36] understand or appreciate the treasures
[50:38] inside this book saints. In fact, most
[50:41] Christians will not know it. Many
[50:43] message people will not know it because
[50:45] they do not accept what the message
[50:47] really is.
[50:48] The reason they don't is that they only
[50:50] see Jesus Christ as an historical figure
[50:54] who saved us from our sins by his shed
[50:56] blood. They do not see the mystery of
[50:58] God revealed in Jesus Christ. To them,
[51:02] Jesus Christ is just a the one who came
[51:05] 2,000 years ago, who died, shed his
[51:07] blood for our sins, and who is coming
[51:09] back. That's what they think Jesus
[51:11] Christ is. But that's not the one that
[51:14] is saluting the seven churches.
[51:19] They do not see the mystery of God
[51:21] revealed in Jesus Christ and the glory
[51:24] of God expressed in his bride through
[51:27] Jesus Christ. They don't accept it
[51:29] because they don't believe it is
[51:31] possible. They don't believe it is
[51:33] possible for them to play that part of
[51:35] being Jesus Christ. They can't see it.
[51:37] Satan has got them because they feel
[51:40] unworthy. They feel unable and they feel
[51:43] like he's got to do all the work and
[51:46] that we must just wait for him to do
[51:48] what he said he would do and keep up,
[51:52] you know, doing whatever scriptures said
[51:54] we must do. Therefore, they miss the
[51:57] most glorious and most important part of
[52:00] the mystery of Christ.
[52:03] All hell is against this truth. Amen.
[52:07] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[52:09] page 489
[52:12] he says it goes right by them and they
[52:14] don't recognize it till it's gone. It
[52:16] only picks up the predestinated seed
[52:18] that God predestinated before the
[52:20] foundation of the earth. The same thing
[52:22] come through in the days of Noah. Same
[52:24] thing come through in the days of Moses,
[52:26] days of Elijah, days of the prophets,
[52:28] days of Jesus on down through and to
[52:31] this very hour. The pregnant person with
[52:34] the seed of God, the word in them
[52:37] manifesting itself is so surrendered to
[52:41] the will of God that the word and the
[52:43] word alone manifests itself in this
[52:47] person, the prisoner to an individual.
[52:51] Not say my church now my church, my
[52:54] church has nothing to do with it. He
[52:55] says it's an individual, one person. All
[52:59] hell is against this teaching. He says
[53:02] again he says all hell is against this
[53:05] truth but it is the truth. This is
[53:08] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[53:10] saints. Paragraph 492. Jesus never said
[53:13] now Peter you and John and all the rest
[53:15] of the people you've got the revelation
[53:17] now the whole church is saved. No, it
[53:20] was to him personally. I say unto thee
[53:24] the not to them. To thee thou art Peter.
[53:29] Upon this rock I'll build my church. And
[53:32] the word Peter means a stone. Stone
[53:33] means the confessed one or the separated
[53:36] one. 494. Upon a certain stone, upon a
[53:40] certain thing, see I called out the
[53:43] church called out. Upon this stone, upon
[53:46] this revelation, flesh and blood had
[53:49] never revealed it to you. But upon this
[53:50] revelation, this called out group, I'll
[53:53] build my church in them. and all the
[53:56] gates of hell will never be able to
[53:58] withstand it. 495
[54:01] Not one hair of your head shall perish.
[54:04] You are mine. I'll raise you up in the
[54:06] last day. Give unto him eternal life and
[54:08] raise him up at the last days. There it
[54:11] is the revelation. Not them, but him, an
[54:15] individual, not a group, an individual.
[54:19] All hell is against it. Last paragraph.
[54:25] But his mystery is only revealed to his
[54:29] beloved bride. That's the only one that
[54:32] could see it. Glory be to God. Amen. So
[54:35] in closing, saints, when you're reading
[54:38] Revelations 1:4-5,
[54:40] and you read this, John to the seven
[54:43] churches which are in Asia, grace be
[54:45] unto you, and peace from him which is
[54:48] and which was and which is to come, and
[54:50] from the seven spirits which are before
[54:52] his throne, and from Jesus Christ. It
[54:55] should read like this. Verse four. I,
[54:59] John, direct this book to the seven
[55:02] future church ages symbolized by the
[55:04] seven cities of Asia Minor, which is
[55:06] modern Turkey, send greetings of
[55:09] goodwill and good wishes to you. And I
[55:12] carry the message we are one which
[55:16] should bring rest, joy of salvation in
[55:18] the thought that you are acknowledged
[55:20] and known of from he who is the one who
[55:24] revealed himself to us today through his
[55:26] word. the same one who led your fathers
[55:28] of the past and who is the one you are
[55:31] looking forward to redeem us all when he
[55:34] comes as he promised and from the seven
[55:36] anointings that express the seven-fold
[55:38] glory of his person that holds the
[55:41] revelation of himself for every age and
[55:44] from the word who was made flesh and
[55:47] dwelt among us born of a woman not of
[55:50] the will of man but of the will of God
[55:53] who promised to make us sons like unto
[55:55] his own glorious self and nurture us
[55:58] until we grow into his own image to be
[56:01] him in the last day.
[56:04] Glory to God. May the Lord bless you
[56:06] saints. Have a wonderful evening with
[56:09] your families. Until the next time, God
[56:11] bless you.
