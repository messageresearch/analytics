[0:02] Amen. God bless you [clears throat]
[0:03] saints. So I'm just going to immediately
[0:06] share the screen and put on the uh
[0:08] presentation
[0:09] uh side by side and I trust that it's
[0:13] going to be easily visible to you. Um
[0:16] we'll try to keep it uh that way. So we
[0:18] want to begin by reading our scripture
[0:21] from Matthew chapter 15 and verse 22-28.
[0:27] And the word of God reads like this.
[0:31] And behold, a woman of Canaan came out
[0:34] of the same coasts and cried unto him,
[0:36] saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou
[0:40] son of David. My daughter is grievously
[0:42] vexed with a devil. But he answered her
[0:45] not a word. And his disciples came and
[0:48] besought him, saying, Send her away, for
[0:51] she crith after us. But he answered and
[0:54] said, I am not sent but unto the lost
[0:57] sheep of the house of Israel.
[1:00] Then came she and worshiped him, saying,
[1:04] Lord, help me. But he answered and said,
[1:07] "It is not meat to take the children's
[1:09] bread and cast it to dogs." And she
[1:12] said, "Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat of
[1:17] the crumbs which fall from their
[1:19] master's table." Then Jesus answered and
[1:22] said unto her,"Oh woman, great is thy
[1:26] faith. Be it unto thee, even as thou
[1:29] wilt." And her daughter was made whole
[1:32] from that very hour.
[1:35] Amen. And the Lord add a blessing to his
[1:37] precious word.
[1:39] So um
[1:42] uh we've been dealing with our subject
[1:45] which is knowing God and knowing the
[1:47] devil. And this is part two. And for a
[1:50] title this morning, is your life a cycle
[1:54] of truth or lies? So, it's a question.
[1:58] Is your life a cycle of truth or lies?
[2:02] All right. So, uh I just want to revise
[2:06] very quickly before we get into the
[2:08] message for today.
[2:10] Uh in part one, we went through all the
[2:15] the scriptures and uh quite a few things
[2:17] to show you that God is the spirit of
[2:20] truth. There's only one thing that the
[2:22] Bible really defines as God and that is
[2:26] God is a spirit. John 4:24. And those
[2:29] who worship him must worship him in
[2:31] spirit and in truth. And the Bible tells
[2:34] us that God is a spirit. And the devil
[2:37] is also become a spirit. And um the Lord
[2:42] Jesus uh defines him as the father of
[2:46] all lies who was a murderer from the
[2:49] beginning. And he even says uh like he
[2:52] cannot help lie lying because that is
[2:55] who he is. That is his very nature.
[2:58] That's how the scripture defines him. So
[3:01] the spirit of truth, God is the spirit
[3:03] of truth. The devil is the spirit of
[3:06] lies. And the the reason why we are
[3:09] speaking about this or bringing it
[3:10] across to you in this way is that almost
[3:13] everyone in the world will never come
[3:15] across the God of the Old Testament.
[3:17] Nobody sees a pillar of fire anymore or
[3:19] a pillar of cloud. Nobody sees angels
[3:23] anymore appearing to them. Nobody sees
[3:25] any other form that God might have used
[3:29] to uh appear to people anymore. And but
[3:33] you come across God more frequently in
[3:36] his spirit nature which is the still
[3:39] small voice which we can tell you is
[3:43] simply truth. When you come across the
[3:47] truth, it is you coming in contact with
[3:51] God. That's how simple this is. So also
[3:56] we don't realize that you come across
[3:58] the devil more frequently than even God
[4:02] because this world we living in is
[4:05] Satan's Eden and he has filled this
[4:08] world with his spirit nature. The devil
[4:11] has and his spirit nature is simply
[4:15] defined as lies. So what I'm saying to
[4:18] you, what I want to show to you today is
[4:20] that you are more likely to come in
[4:23] contact with the devil almost every
[4:26] minute of the day because you are living
[4:28] in his paradise.
[4:31] And uh this is why our souls search so
[4:34] much for the truth because we are
[4:36] surrounded by the devil. Uh and so uh
[4:40] people think that you know uh the reason
[4:43] why they are so deluded about this is
[4:46] they they think of the devil as some uh
[4:49] horned scaly creature who's under the
[4:52] ground and that's not at all what what
[4:56] he is. So this was brought to my
[4:59] attention I think from the last video
[5:01] that went up on YouTube. There was a
[5:05] sincere and wonderful brother. I don't
[5:07] know who he is. Uh I think his name says
[5:10] Oscar del Rio I think and the reason I'm
[5:12] saying it is because it's there on the
[5:16] uh in his handle and um
[5:20] and so um from what I was shown he he
[5:23] was very gracious and he was not at all
[5:26] being u you know uh critical or anything
[5:30] but simply didn't may not have
[5:32] understood what we were saying and uh so
[5:35] I just want to commend his his wonderful
[5:37] spirit
[5:39] uh and his honesty. Uh that's that's
[5:42] what we should all be um truthful. So I
[5:45] just wanted to clear up something cuz it
[5:47] looked like what I said must have
[5:48] disillusioned him. Uh I was in no way
[5:52] saying there is no real devil or real
[5:55] god. There is a real god and a real
[5:58] devil. But real doesn't have to mean the
[6:01] way science fiction shows it or the way
[6:04] men draw paintings and make pictures or
[6:07] give us the uh the limitation of man's
[6:11] understanding. That's not real, right?
[6:14] Uh real is a is a lot closer than we
[6:17] think. So um God is a real spirit that
[6:22] lives and works in and around us. So is
[6:27] the devil who was once an angel
[6:30] then was fallen lost his first estate
[6:33] and lost his first bodily existence. He
[6:37] is now a lying spirit trapped in a
[6:40] fifthdimension existence. So the prophet
[6:43] said in a message God keeps his word. He
[6:46] says everybody knows that the devil
[6:49] doesn't have a corporal body. That's a
[6:53] quote right? And another one from the
[6:55] from the message exhortation of divine
[6:58] healing. He says, "A devil is helpless
[7:01] if he isn't in a body somewhere. He's
[7:05] just a spirit in the world until he's in
[7:08] a body and then he can torment us." So
[7:11] everything I told you, I may not be able
[7:13] to have the time to read all the quotes
[7:15] to you. But everything I've told you is
[7:18] taken from the message and from the
[7:20] prophet. It's not my own thoughts,
[7:22] right? uh my own thoughts are guided by
[7:24] the message and the Bible. So that's
[7:28] what we were pointing to that people are
[7:30] afraid of a devil of fiction not
[7:34] realizing you are living in a lie or
[7:37] surrounded by lies and the real devil is
[7:42] closer to you than you actually know.
[7:45] Likewise, God presents himself today in
[7:48] his logos, the truth. And those of us
[7:51] who speak the truth are the voice of God
[7:55] in this time. Amen.
[7:59] So to get to our
[8:02] um subject, is your life a cycle of
[8:06] truth or lies? And um
[8:10] Matthew 15:22-28.
[8:12] I just want to focus on that before we
[8:15] get into the actual message. And I'd
[8:17] like you to consider the conversation of
[8:19] the Lord Jesus and this Syrophenician
[8:22] woman. So if you'll notice, there is
[8:26] demonology at play here, right? This
[8:30] woman's daughter is vexed with the devil
[8:35] uh and which is a lying spirit. She
[8:38] comes to Jesus addressing him as son of
[8:42] David, which is king of Israel. She
[8:44] clearly has a revelation. She's she's
[8:46] calling him king of Israel and she's
[8:49] Cyrophenician, which is uh from Syria,
[8:52] right? Um and and and she's calling the
[8:56] Lord Jesus Christ um king of Israel.
[9:01] She's doing something that not even the
[9:03] Jewish people will do right at the time.
[9:06] So clearly she has a revelation. She's
[9:10] not even a complete or actual Israelite,
[9:13] but she recognizes him as king of
[9:15] Israel. Calls him by the title and he
[9:19] ignores her. And then she persists and
[9:22] the disciples are becoming annoyed and
[9:25] they're saying, "Lord, send her away.
[9:27] She cried after us." Like she's nagging
[9:30] at us, right? And um because they
[9:33] couldn't drive her away and and because
[9:35] she's being so persistent, the disciples
[9:38] are starting to get annoyed.
[9:40] And then Christ turns to her and says to
[9:42] her, "My ministry is only for the
[9:45] suffering of Israel." He said he and he
[9:49] said this knowing that Israel is
[9:52] rejecting him and would fully reject
[9:55] him, right? and that and he knows that
[9:58] his word is going to the Gentiles
[10:00] eventually, but he had to do miracles in
[10:04] Israel so that he would be rejected and
[10:07] killed by Israel. And nobody else knew
[10:10] that purpose. So he had to stick to his
[10:12] plan. If you think about it, he couldn't
[10:14] go off among the Gentiles now and start
[10:17] doing miracles among them. they would
[10:19] have all accepted him because the pagans
[10:22] and the heathens they uh loved miracles
[10:25] and they would believe any person who
[10:27] came in uh doing miracles because they
[10:30] didn't even know who God is and they
[10:32] would make him an idol immediately. So
[10:34] Christ knew exactly what he was doing.
[10:36] He was not going out to the Gentiles. So
[10:38] when some people look at this and say,
[10:40] "Oh, he was so cruel." You know,
[10:42] atheists and other people look what he
[10:44] did to this woman and look what he said.
[10:46] But the purpose was he knew what his
[10:48] purpose was. He had to be rejected by
[10:51] Israel and he had to do those miracles
[10:54] and signs and wonders amongst the
[10:56] Israelites. But anyway, that's a
[10:58] different subject.
[11:00] So she forces herself nearer to him,
[11:04] bowing down to him as if to a king. And
[11:08] his speech is absolutely brutal to her.
[11:12] He as much as calls her a dog. He says,
[11:16] "It is not meat. It is not uh uh um
[11:23] I'm I'm missing the word, but it is not
[11:25] meat for me to give the children's bread
[11:29] to dogs." He's literally telling her
[11:32] she's a dog. To us, that looks so bad of
[11:36] the savior, Jesus Christ, the savior of
[11:39] the world. But in that time it was well
[11:42] known that non-Israelite people were
[11:46] regarded as unclean because of their
[11:48] living right [clears throat] their
[11:50] unrighteousness their immorality and
[11:52] among the Israelites they they were
[11:55] known as dogs because they were immoral
[11:58] and the saraphanician women would have
[12:00] known that that is the term that the
[12:02] Israelites would have used for them. And
[12:05] so um she she knew that she comes from a
[12:09] background of loose morals and
[12:12] filthiness in public. Now what I'm
[12:14] bringing you to is
[12:17] he told her the brutal truth. In her
[12:22] time of need where she needs healing for
[12:26] her daughter, her daughter is vexed with
[12:29] the devil.
[12:31] This woman, now this is what I want to I
[12:33] want to do. I want to put I want you to
[12:35] put yourself into her shoes. Like many
[12:39] of you would come to your pastor today
[12:42] or somebody and you would come for help
[12:45] and you maybe you need healing, maybe
[12:47] you have some kind of need in your life
[12:50] and everybody today just want pastor
[12:54] please lay your hands on me and pray for
[12:56] me and I'll be well. My question is,
[13:01] what if I told you the brutal truth and
[13:05] that brutal truth is going to produce
[13:08] your faith for what you need. Would you
[13:11] accept it? Right? He tells her the
[13:16] brutal truth. You are a dog. What I have
[13:19] is not for you. And having told her the
[13:22] truth, she doesn't resist. She accepts
[13:26] the truth and listen to what she says.
[13:29] Truth, Lord.
[13:32] Wow. For me, you know, when I read those
[13:35] words, it it was it was a stark
[13:38] realization to me because we in this
[13:40] world have been surrounded by lies and
[13:43] we struggle to accept the truth and yet
[13:46] the truth sets us free.
[13:48] So she admitted who she was.
[13:52] truth Lord, I am a dog and that I don't
[13:56] deserve any help from you and that she
[13:58] was nothing compared to him or Israel.
[14:03] What an admission to make. Saints, you
[14:06] we don't completely appreciate what she
[14:10] means by truth. Lord, I am a dog. I am
[14:13] not deserving. I uh I am not like you or
[14:17] Israel. I'm not like the children. I I
[14:20] understand we are a filthy people. I am
[14:23] immoral. I am not deserving. But that
[14:27] recognition broke the hold of demonology
[14:31] binding her daughter.
[14:33] The acceptance of truth broke the fifth
[14:37] dimension that was holding a daughter.
[14:39] The Lord Jesus, watch this, doesn't even
[14:42] have to pray like some of you expect
[14:44] hands to be laid on you. He doesn't even
[14:47] have to pray. He doesn't have to lay
[14:49] hand he doesn't have to lay hands on
[14:51] anybody. He just commens her faith and
[14:53] told her that whatever she desired is
[14:56] going to be because of her faith because
[15:00] she accepted truth. See this is what God
[15:03] really is and this is what people who
[15:06] are religious Christians even message
[15:09] people who are religious Christians fail
[15:11] to understand that accepting truth
[15:15] breaks demonology.
[15:17] Amen. So my question to you as we begin
[15:21] today's message, could you handle the
[15:24] truth about your life, [snorts]
[15:27] who you are, what your problem is, would
[15:30] you in the face of such brutal truth
[15:34] submit or will you push back and fight?
[15:38] Right? Her simple act of accepting truth
[15:42] broke all holes of demonology. And
[15:45] that's all it takes. Truth destroys lies
[15:49] and its effects. Amen.
[15:53] All right. So, with that, I want to uh
[15:56] go to our next um part of this subject,
[16:01] which is uh the lies in the Bible. Uh
[16:05] very quickly before we get to that, I
[16:07] just want to show you that in the Bible,
[16:10] it's like I didn't put it here in the
[16:12] screen, but if you look in the Bible,
[16:15] you have children of God. Um the the
[16:20] Bible literally documents all the lies
[16:24] spoken, you know, by believers
[16:28] right from the be the beginning. Um the
[16:31] serpent in the garden of Eden says to
[16:33] the woman, "You will not surely die."
[16:36] And then Adam and Eve were immediately
[16:39] affected by the unbelief and cast blame
[16:42] on each other. Right from the very
[16:44] beginning, lies started causing the
[16:46] downfall of of mankind, which was simply
[16:50] saying, "It was the woman that you gave
[16:52] me or the woman says it was the
[16:54] serpent." That is deflection from my
[16:56] guilt. It's already starting the cycle
[16:59] of lies. And then look at the next one
[17:02] which is Cain literally lying to God.
[17:05] Cain, where is your brother? I don't
[17:07] know. Am I my brother's keeper? He lies
[17:09] about murdering his brother. And when
[17:11] God asks him where Abel is, he says, I
[17:14] don't know. What is that? Covering up of
[17:16] wrongdoing. Then you have Abram claimed
[17:20] Sarah was his sister two times. And what
[17:23] was he doing? He was doing that to
[17:25] preserve his own life, right? And then
[17:28] there was Sarah who laughed when Elohim
[17:31] came to the tent. And then she said, "I
[17:33] didn't laugh." Right? What was he doing
[17:36] again? Covering up. And then you had
[17:39] Isaac who did the same as Abram and lied
[17:42] that Rebecca was his sister again to
[17:44] preserve his own life. Then you had
[17:46] Rebecca and Jacob who uh Rebecca helped
[17:50] Jacob to deceive Isaac as if Jacob was
[17:54] Esau taking the blessing of the
[17:56] firstborn. That was using manipulation
[17:59] and deception for self gain. Uh what
[18:03] about Joseph's brothers who dipped
[18:05] Joseph's blood in the the the the dips
[18:08] Joseph's coat in the blood of a kid goat
[18:11] [snorts] and then lied that he was
[18:13] killed by a wild animal. Right. That was
[18:16] again manipulation for self gain.
[18:20] This one is amazing. You've got Rahab
[18:22] who literally lies to the king's
[18:25] soldiers to say, "I don't know where the
[18:27] spies are. I've never seen them." And
[18:30] yet she's hiding them in the rooftop of
[18:32] a house under some straw or something or
[18:35] the other. And uh here she lying to to
[18:40] preserve the life of God's children.
[18:42] Lying to do the right thing. And then
[18:44] you in the old in the New Testament you
[18:46] have Ananas and Safh who were part of
[18:50] the church who were people who were
[18:52] respected who had the Holy Ghost and
[18:55] then they come and lie about the money
[18:57] from property sale and are struck dead
[19:01] but again lying for self gain. And then
[19:04] of course you have Peter, the one who
[19:07] just had the uh revelation and the rock
[19:12] upon which the church would be built.
[19:16] When asked, are you one of them? He
[19:18] lies. And the Lord told him, you you're
[19:20] going to deny me three times
[19:24] and before the crows. And uh he
[19:27] denies the Lord Jesus three times. He
[19:29] lies for what? for preservation of his
[19:32] own life. Right? So you can see that
[19:36] lies are all over the Bible in the lives
[19:39] of sons of God. And the point is even
[19:42] good God called people succumb to lying
[19:46] and sometimes for good reasons. But the
[19:50] consequences were not always good uh for
[19:53] them because lying leads to a path of
[19:56] life that comes with a lot of problems.
[19:59] Listen saints, this is what we're we're
[20:02] bringing you to. Knowing God, knowing
[20:04] the devil, right? If you live by truth,
[20:08] it takes you down a certain path of
[20:11] life. If you live by lies, it takes you
[20:14] a different path of life. And this is
[20:17] how easy it is to know when you are
[20:20] walking in uh or walking with God or
[20:25] walking with the devil. Don't be
[20:27] thinking of God like some person in a
[20:31] cloud who's far away from you or the
[20:34] devil who is somebody under the ground
[20:36] like I told you who's far away from you.
[20:39] No, those spirits are right with you
[20:43] every minute of the day. And so remember
[20:47] we started all this because we were
[20:50] speaking to the Sunday school and we're
[20:52] talking about the two voices. putting it
[20:54] very simply for little children that
[20:57] there are whenever you want to do
[20:58] something there are always two voices
[21:00] there. There's one that tells you you
[21:02] should do the right thing. There's
[21:03] another one that's telling you to do the
[21:05] more exciting thing that's not right and
[21:08] you should listen to the voice that
[21:09] tells you the right thing. Young
[21:11] children remember that. All right, let's
[21:13] go to um the next part of our of our
[21:18] subject which is
[21:22] your life has been led by lie after lie
[21:28] from the very beginning. So that's what
[21:30] we want to start by showing you. Okay,
[21:32] we'll start with a quote from a thinking
[21:35] man's filter paragraph 121. Brother Bam
[21:39] says, "When you come in this world, you
[21:41] were born in sin. You didn't even come
[21:44] with a fighting chance.
[21:47] You were born in sin, shaped in
[21:50] iniquity, come to the world speaking
[21:53] lies with your own spirit, the desire of
[21:56] sin, a lover of sin. Because you were
[21:59] born in sin, you didn't have a chance."
[22:03] All right? Born into this world without
[22:06] even a fighting chance. And you come
[22:08] into this world speaking lies. This is
[22:11] what happens. The moment you come into
[22:13] this world, the moment you can talk, the
[22:14] moment you become sentient, you'll
[22:16] always want to cover up something. It's
[22:19] it's literally ingrained in our DNA from
[22:23] our first parents, Adam and Eve. Now, I
[22:28] want to take this as a teaching where we
[22:31] just we talk to you and we want to make
[22:35] this more real. And I want you while
[22:38] you're sitting there listening to me to
[22:41] let your mind go back as we're speaking,
[22:45] go back to your childhood, to your
[22:47] teenagers, those of you who are adults,
[22:51] uh to when you got married, to the
[22:54] struggles you went through, the times
[22:56] you had children, issues you had with
[22:58] family. Just think about all of that,
[22:59] right? If you're a young person, you're
[23:02] a teenager, think about where you are
[23:04] right now. Think about your childhood.
[23:06] Okay, they're going to start with the
[23:09] most
[23:10] uh shocking statement. For some of us,
[23:14] it it would feel like that your entire
[23:18] life
[23:20] has been a lie because you were born
[23:25] speaking lies.
[23:27] It is hard for you to live the truth
[23:30] because everything in this life in this
[23:33] modern world tells you to cover up
[23:37] everything to live a covered up life in
[23:41] order for you to survive. Your your
[23:44] natural instinct is to cover up truth
[23:48] because you are afraid that if you live
[23:51] by the truth or speak the truth, you
[23:53] will be exposed. And for some reason,
[23:56] you feel this fightorflight response
[23:59] like if I tell the truth, they're going
[24:02] to get me. If I tell the truth, they're
[24:04] going to overpower me. So there's like
[24:06] this feeling of dominance. You are
[24:09] trying to live by lies because you want
[24:12] to dominate the situation. You want to
[24:15] control your life and you're afraid. And
[24:18] this is why most Christians, message
[24:22] believers,
[24:23] um, you're living by more lies than
[24:26] truth. Right? So, I want you to answer
[24:30] this question to yourself. Do you think
[24:33] who you are right now and and that your
[24:37] life today is based upon truth or lies?
[24:42] Can you confidently say that who I am at
[24:48] church is who I am at home? Who I am in
[24:51] public is who I am at home. Who I am at
[24:55] work is who I am at home. Or am I
[24:58] putting on a front everywhere I go and
[25:02] only the people who live close to me
[25:04] know exactly who I am? Well, this is the
[25:07] problem. See, even if you do not
[25:10] deliberately live by lies, you do not
[25:13] naturally recognize what is true anymore
[25:16] because you become so used to living
[25:20] this way cuz you your parents taught it
[25:22] to you, your teachers taught it to you,
[25:24] the the government does it, everybody
[25:26] does it. And because your entire you
[25:29] feel like your entire survival has been
[25:31] based on protecting your true intentions
[25:35] on anything for fear of being found out
[25:39] or manipulated by others. We feel like
[25:42] we have to not tell the complete truth
[25:45] because we'll be manipulated and if they
[25:48] really know then they'll attack us or
[25:50] they'll do something. You must know
[25:52] everybody feels that way. Everybody in
[25:54] the world wants to do that. Yet life
[25:56] would be so much easier if we all just
[25:59] told the truth and then we wouldn't
[26:01] attack each other, right? We'd be more
[26:04] comfortable with each other.
[26:07] You might say right now, "Brother Al, I
[26:10] don't lie very much."
[26:12] But I want to tell you the spirit of
[26:14] lies and the nature of lies has already
[26:17] infiltrated your life so much and become
[26:20] so much a part of you that it is even
[26:23] the reason people struggle with life in
[26:26] the message. Why do you struggle to keep
[26:29] the standards of the message to keep the
[26:31] word is because our life has been
[26:34] infiltrated by lies and we we just don't
[26:37] want to admit it. Right? So I want to
[26:40] show you uh share a scripture from Amos
[26:44] Amos chapter 2
[26:47] 4.
[26:50] And the Bible says, "Thus sayeth the
[26:53] Lord, for three transgressions of Judah,
[26:56] and for four I will not turn away the
[26:58] punishment thereof, because they have
[27:00] despised the law of the Lord and have
[27:02] not kept his commandments. and their
[27:05] lies cause them to er after the which
[27:09] their fathers have walked.
[27:12] Okay?
[27:15] So their lies cause them to live in
[27:18] error. Their lies cause them to go into
[27:23] error and walk in the same mistakes of
[27:26] their ancestors.
[27:28] This is the truth, saints. This is the
[27:30] Bible literally telling you what happens
[27:33] when you live by lies.
[27:36] Your body has been affected. Now, just
[27:39] so you know, you can read a beautiful
[27:41] series in the message called demonology.
[27:44] Demon, demonology, physical realm,
[27:46] religious realm, and enticing spirits.
[27:49] If you really study it properly and
[27:52] understand it, you will see the effect
[27:54] of lies. lies that literally affect your
[27:58] cells of your body to brother Ram says
[28:01] interrupt its nature
[28:03] uh a lie taking place to form a cancer
[28:07] and that's what divine healing does is
[28:11] it kicks out the lie it kicks out the
[28:12] evil spirit even though the growth will
[28:15] remain or remnants of it will still
[28:17] remain but it can kick out truth can
[28:20] kick out the life the life of that demon
[28:24] so your body has been affected and
[28:27] influenced from the outside since you
[28:29] were a child. Where you should have
[28:32] learned love, you learned hate. Where
[28:36] you should have learned sharing,
[28:38] you learned taking. Where you should
[28:41] have learned humility, you learned
[28:43] pride. Instead of courage, you learned
[28:46] fear. Instead of honesty, you learned
[28:49] deceit and manipulation.
[28:52] A lot of us even take pleasure in
[28:55] manipulation. I I cannot tell you how
[28:58] many times I um I hear I heard people in
[29:02] my past from my childhood even growing
[29:05] up and and um you know even amongst
[29:08] messaged people come and tell tell us
[29:11] you know what we told them this is what
[29:12] we told them you know we didn't let them
[29:14] get away with this and so on and in my
[29:16] mind I'm thinking but you didn't tell
[29:17] the truth you manipulated those people
[29:21] you know and I was always um like
[29:25] affected by watching elders manipulating
[29:29] people just for dominance. And I could
[29:31] see as I watched it unfold in my life
[29:34] and the message how that when you when
[29:37] they did that, it never worked out right
[29:39] for them. It always came back and
[29:41] slammed them in the face. Whereas in the
[29:43] beginning, they should have just told
[29:44] the truth.
[29:47] So you don't really know, right? There
[29:50] are thousands of things that you should
[29:53] have you should have uh tended towards
[29:58] love, sharing, humility, courage,
[30:02] honesty. Instead, you tended towards
[30:05] hate,
[30:07] taking, self-love, pride, fear,
[30:10] manipulation, and deceit. And there are
[30:13] thousands of other things. We could
[30:15] spend days examining the characteristics
[30:18] in life and you'll be amazed how many
[30:20] things. So you actually don't realize
[30:23] how these things affect you.
[30:26] I want to tell you most marriages fail
[30:30] because you don't marry with the thought
[30:33] of what I can do for him or her. the uh
[30:38] they marry with the thought of what he
[30:40] or she can give to me or how will I
[30:44] benefit from this what will I gain from
[30:46] this marriage and the nature of lies
[30:49] produces a nature of selfishness or
[30:52] selfcenteredness
[30:54] therefore when you hear the word the
[30:57] word of God you have the same reaction
[31:01] everybody listens to the message
[31:03] thinking how do I benefit from this
[31:06] message how do I benefit from the word.
[31:09] Uh do you ever think every day of your
[31:12] life, what can I do for the Lord? What
[31:15] can I do for the people? What can I do
[31:18] for the word?
[31:21] uh when you live by truth when you live
[31:23] and walk in the light and uh as he is
[31:27] the light and you you are always
[31:30] thinking about what I can do for for the
[31:33] word what I can do for the people what I
[31:35] can do for it's not selfishness all the
[31:38] time and this is what I'm saying to you
[31:40] when you constantly live by the way the
[31:43] world has directed the natures of people
[31:47] you tend to always govern your mind by
[31:51] how I can benefit. That's why you would
[31:55] not tell the complete truth about
[31:56] something because you want to dominate
[31:58] the situation so I can gain. That's how
[32:01] it is. It's like business, right? So the
[32:04] reason why you, me, and all believers
[32:08] struggle so much in life is because we
[32:10] are focused more on what we can do for
[32:13] ourselves.
[32:15] And we don't realize by living that way.
[32:18] Now, I'm not telling you something
[32:19] foreign, right? Because you know what
[32:22] Christ is about. The entire message of
[32:25] Christ is uh take up your cross and
[32:29] follow me is I lay my life down
[32:32] willingly. I give it for you. That's the
[32:36] message of Christ. That's that's the
[32:38] very meaning and definition of Christ is
[32:42] to be the savior of the world. A savior
[32:45] of the world is not asking the question,
[32:47] how does this benefit me? And you could
[32:49] see the trial in Gethsemane was, Lord,
[32:52] if it be thy will, let this cup pass.
[32:54] Nevertheless, not my will, but thy will
[32:57] [clears throat] be done. All right, so
[33:00] let's move to the next step. I want to
[33:02] show you that the spirit of lies is so
[33:06] subtle that you don't realize you're
[33:08] actually living by it. Right? So, uh,
[33:12] the next step is to realize that you've
[33:16] actually been groomed by lies. Right
[33:22] now, knowing who God is and who the
[33:25] devil is, you have to ask yourself,
[33:28] where do you see the spirit of lies in
[33:30] this life? And the fact is, it's
[33:32] everywhere. It's in everything man has
[33:35] created. Everything man creates has to
[33:38] come with an advertisement to convince
[33:41] you that you need it. Everything be it
[33:45] food,
[33:47] how it's packaged,
[33:49] medicines, cars, there is nothing man
[33:52] can sell and say this speaks for itself.
[33:57] It is the complete truth. There is no
[33:59] deception. This meat has no injections,
[34:02] no hormones. No, nothing is sold and
[34:06] told to you. What you see is what you
[34:09] get. This is it. No, it all comes with
[34:12] an advertisement. And then it comes with
[34:14] explanations why you should believe or
[34:17] have this, why you need this one instead
[34:20] of something else that someone else is
[34:21] giving. It's all propaganda. And the
[34:24] fact is it's everywhere. So the reality
[34:26] is that from the time you were born, you
[34:30] were being exposed to lies everywhere
[34:33] even before you even take interest in
[34:36] the world in the word of God. Right now
[34:41] the life we have formed in society is
[34:46] all based on lies. our government is our
[34:50] our our public uh uh servants, our
[34:54] school teachers, they are all
[34:57] programmed, our companies, our bosses,
[35:00] our CEOs, the ones who pay our give us
[35:04] our paychecks, they're the ones who are
[35:07] manipulating everything there. There's
[35:09] there's nowhere where you can find
[35:12] something that says this will save the
[35:15] world. This that I'm giving you is not
[35:17] for me. It is for you. It is for your
[35:20] benefit. A and you will be the better
[35:23] one out of this. Not even me. Nothing in
[35:26] this world does that. Everything we do
[35:29] comes with a price to pay. Right? So the
[35:33] spirit of lies is so subtle. Now I want
[35:37] you to answer this question. How many of
[35:39] you think that you that your life is not
[35:43] seriously or terribly affected by the
[35:46] spirit of lies? Right. Um
[35:50] I want to say this very carefully but
[35:53] also because we have to.
[35:59] The place today where we are getting the
[36:02] most amount of deception and
[36:04] manipulation and lies the greatest lies
[36:08] are coming from the pulpits
[36:11] from Christian churches and pulpits.
[36:14] Listen somebody out in the world if
[36:16] don't even think Islam is a lie,
[36:19] Hinduism is a lie or those things are
[36:23] not even the greatest cover up of the
[36:26] truth. They're not. There are honest
[36:29] genuine people trying to serve in in
[36:32] actual fact they are people who who
[36:35] might even be living in ignorance.
[36:38] Person who's living in ignorance and
[36:39] telling you something. You look at them
[36:41] and you look at them with disdain. You
[36:44] you treat them as if they are liars.
[36:46] Don't do that. They're not. You know,
[36:48] brother Brandham says a real sinner is a
[36:51] man who sits in church and knows what is
[36:54] right and doesn't do it. He says that's
[36:56] a sinner. The drunk in the street is not
[36:58] a sinner because he doesn't know any
[37:00] better. So what we're saying is the the
[37:04] greatest deception there will ever be
[37:06] will be in the pulpits.
[37:09] Right? Why? Because they are handling
[37:12] the truth and manipulating it. This is
[37:16] why we have the Bible telling us that in
[37:19] the last days the son of pition will
[37:21] stand in the holy place making himself
[37:25] to be God. What is that? The ultimate
[37:28] lie, the ultimate deception.
[37:31] All right. So let's start with parents,
[37:34] right? And I'm talking now to the young
[37:37] people.
[37:39] Let's look at whether your life is
[37:42] shaped by lies today. And I want you as
[37:44] the young people, some of you want to
[37:46] get baptized.
[37:47] Um, I want to tell you, you must get
[37:51] comfortable with telling the truth
[37:53] before you get baptized.
[37:55] You must get comfortable with living an
[37:57] honest life because you are presenting
[38:00] yourself to the church. And if you want
[38:03] to be baptized, you must commit yourself
[38:06] to speaking and living the truth. Live
[38:09] in the light. Walk in the light. Be the
[38:11] light. Right. So I want to ask you right
[38:14] now young people if your parents
[38:17] questioned you about something do you
[38:20] tell them the truth the whole truth? Do
[38:23] you tell them what they want to hear? Uh
[38:27] did or do you tell them
[38:30] uh tell it to them in a way to sway
[38:32] their opinion of you like no mom, no
[38:36] dad, it didn't happen like that was
[38:38] because they told me this and my brother
[38:41] or my sister showed me this first and
[38:43] they What are you doing? What do you
[38:46] think the outcome is going to be?
[38:49] You're trying to get mom and dad on your
[38:51] side for what reason? And the more you
[38:53] try to speak in a deceptive or
[38:55] manipulative way, you can see mom or
[38:57] dad's eyes doing this or something or
[39:00] their eyebrows or something or their
[39:02] hands start to move. They're sensing
[39:04] something like you're manipulating the
[39:06] situation. They know something is not
[39:09] right. But because they love you and and
[39:11] and you're their child, they want to
[39:13] give you the benefit of the doubt. But
[39:14] what you are doing is a dangerous thing
[39:17] because you are literally manipulating
[39:19] someone's love to dominate them.
[39:22] Right. My question is, were you afraid
[39:26] that if they knew the truth, they
[39:27] wouldn't treat you the way you want them
[39:30] to? Were what was your victory from
[39:33] lying to your parents? You go back to
[39:36] your room and all you won was being a
[39:38] manipulator and a deceiver. Yes, they
[39:42] didn't uh they don't know the truth.
[39:44] Yes, they don't know everything. Yes, I
[39:46] sorted the situation out. There's no
[39:48] more animosity. My feelings are intact.
[39:51] Great. But the only thing you won was a
[39:55] prize for being a really good convincing
[39:57] liar and nothing else, right?
[40:01] How about when you have fights or
[40:03] struggles or arguments with your
[40:05] siblings? It's natural to want to have
[40:08] the upper hand over your sibling, your
[40:10] brother or your sister. But the question
[40:12] is, did you manipulate them and present
[40:14] things to your parents to deliberately
[40:17] bring down your own siblings characters?
[40:20] Did you take joy in seeing them get into
[40:23] trouble? Can you solve your issues with
[40:26] them without being deceptive and
[40:28] manipulative? Can you actually talk to
[40:31] your siblings just by telling the truth?
[40:34] You will respect each other so much more
[40:36] if you do. How about when you're in
[40:39] school?
[40:41] Your 12 years of school, young people,
[40:44] and you old people think back to it.
[40:47] It was an absolute melting pot of lies,
[40:49] right? It's where you learned to become
[40:52] an expert liar. You lied about
[40:55] schoolwork. You cheated on projects and
[40:58] tests. You lied when your parents helped
[41:00] you went and said, "No, I did it myself.
[41:02] My dad didn't do it for me." And then
[41:04] your parents lied and said, "They didn't
[41:06] do it. He did everything himself. We
[41:09] didn't even help."
[41:11] And and you looked at this thinking,
[41:12] "Oh, well, this is okay." You know
[41:15] teachers lied, friends lied about you,
[41:18] you lied about friends and all these
[41:21] effects of lying was being programmed
[41:25] into you and grooming you.
[41:29] You don't realize that you have these
[41:31] best friends in your school, your best
[41:33] girlfriend, your your best friend who's
[41:36] a guy, whatever, and they're all
[41:38] together and they're telling you how
[41:39] great you are, how awesome you are.
[41:41] They're agreeing with you when you do
[41:43] wrong things. You don't realize that
[41:46] your innocent little soul, even though
[41:49] your flesh and your mind is loving this
[41:52] person or liking this person, just
[41:54] because they're making your feelings uh
[41:57] feel better. What's actually happening
[42:00] is your little soul is distrusting
[42:04] people more and more and more and more.
[42:07] As more lies, as you see more lies, you
[42:10] develop more doubt and more fear, more
[42:14] distrust, more anxiety. Eventually, over
[42:17] time, it's grooming you into a person
[42:20] who's barely going to trust anybody or
[42:23] anything you hear, and you're going to
[42:25] live with so much of fear in your life.
[42:28] If you go to public school today,
[42:32] you enter school as a sweet, innocent,
[42:34] cute little angel in your beautiful
[42:38] little uniform. Your parents taking
[42:40] pictures of you, your little smile, your
[42:42] little pigtails maybe for a girl. And if
[42:45] you're a boy, your little cap on your
[42:47] beautiful little angel. After 12 years,
[42:51] you finish school being a fun-loving,
[42:55] funny, cool, sassy, suspicious,
[42:59] manipulative, calculating little devil.
[43:02] That's the truth. That's what all
[43:04] teenagers exit school as. Because you've
[43:07] learned to deceive everybody. And we
[43:10] wonder why we even send our kids to
[43:12] school. Okay, look at dating.
[43:16] This culture of dating has been taught
[43:19] to you as an exciting game, a game of
[43:21] cat and mouse. You almost feel like you
[43:24] have to follow the way dating uh is
[43:27] defined because if you don't uh it won't
[43:30] come right, it won't work. And it's this
[43:32] this game that's meant to be the the
[43:36] romance must be uh so strong, but it's
[43:40] all deception, right? It's it used to be
[43:43] something honorable many many years ago
[43:46] and but now it's just a game and it
[43:48] creates an addiction to winning. This is
[43:51] why
[43:53] men have become called players in this
[43:57] world today because they are addicted to
[43:59] the game. They don't really care about
[44:01] the girl. They love the game. They love
[44:04] to manipulate her, get her into their
[44:07] their bed and that's it. Right? and then
[44:11] ditch them because they're gotten so
[44:14] addicted to this game of lying and
[44:17] manipulation and deception. And it
[44:19] involves using all kinds of means and
[44:22] ways to force you to coersse you to like
[44:26] somebody and to be with them. But it's
[44:29] all based on a complete facade.
[44:33] All on to to the point where if a young
[44:37] girl is just truthful to someone,
[44:39] they'll despise her. They'll even think
[44:42] that the truth she's telling them is a
[44:44] lie. And same with a guy. If he comes
[44:48] out and just says, "Listen, this is what
[44:50] I am. Uh I'm not that rich. I'm not that
[44:54] impressive, but
[44:57] you know, if you'll accept me, I'll
[44:59] stick with you through life and I'll
[45:00] never fail you. I'll do my best never to
[45:02] fail you. And if I do, I'll do
[45:05] everything my in my power to make it up
[45:06] to you and put it right. Nobody's
[45:08] [snorts]
[45:09] in this world today. The amazing thing
[45:12] is the young girls would rather go for a
[45:14] total fraud who sweet talks them, who
[45:16] presents himself as somebody who he is
[45:19] not. He's not worth a grain of salt, but
[45:22] they're so used to his his fine words
[45:25] and his hairstyle and uh his manner of
[45:29] coercing them and manipulation. And
[45:31] because all of you are groomed by lies,
[45:34] you're just going to fall to both sides,
[45:36] men and women, just cannot even tell the
[45:38] truth anymore. Nobody just tells the
[45:41] truth anymore, says exactly how they
[45:43] feel about something. Why? because you
[45:47] feel like you have to keep up
[45:48] appearances in case you lose them and
[45:52] you're not sure why,
[45:55] whether they are the one or they're not
[45:57] the one. So, you lie.
[46:02] That's a lot of gambling. Young people,
[46:04] how about college and university?
[46:07] So, you exit school as this
[46:09] manipulative, calculating devil, right?
[46:11] We said that. Then you go to college and
[46:14] university. And college and university
[46:17] is where lying
[46:20] marries pride
[46:22] and gives birth to a monster.
[46:26] Okay? You become the most intellectual
[46:29] and dangerous liar when you go to
[46:32] universities and college because now you
[46:35] you exited high school a manipulating
[46:37] calculative devil. But now you're going
[46:40] to go to university and come out with
[46:42] being a man manipulating calculating
[46:45] devil with a degree
[46:48] with uh something to your name that
[46:51] certifies you right. You become an
[46:55] intellectual
[46:57] dangerous liar. You feel important
[47:00] because you don't realize you've been
[47:02] set up. You feel important because you
[47:04] get a higher education. You can now
[47:07] teach your mom and dad something about
[47:08] life, your pastor, the people around
[47:11] you. You suddenly can educate people
[47:13] online just cuz you got a degree. And
[47:15] you don't realize you just got to pass
[47:18] into the fifth dimension.
[47:21] This is your most vulnerable stage in
[47:23] the word because it's at this stage that
[47:26] you will openly debate and question God
[47:29] and the word and you don't realize it's
[47:32] all because of a certificate that's
[47:34] making you feel more important than even
[47:37] the truth. This is where you are now
[47:40] being told there is my truth, your
[47:43] truth. Everyone's got their own truth.
[47:46] You've been sold the greatest lie.
[47:50] You've now just basically become a
[47:51] higher level devil
[47:54] because a level a devil is a false
[47:56] accuser, right? That's the meaning of
[47:58] it. Then you get to marriage life.
[48:01] Marriage and family life is where you
[48:03] start to realize now you you you uh
[48:06] you've been educated, you got you get
[48:08] your job, you you meet a girl, you meet
[48:10] a a guy, whatever, you get married, you
[48:13] start life. Now you're living with a
[48:15] person, right? And when you're living
[48:18] with a person is where you start
[48:20] realizing that all the lies you were
[48:23] groomed with in your past was a waste of
[48:27] time. And it's all comes flooding in and
[48:30] catching up with you in 5 minutes,
[48:33] right? Because now the woman who's
[48:34] staying with you can see who you really
[48:36] are. Your children can see who
[48:39] [clears throat] you really are. You're
[48:40] starting to show your own parents who
[48:42] you really are. your in-laws, who you
[48:44] really are, and it all comes crashing
[48:46] down. Now, how do you undo an entire
[48:50] life of being groomed by lies unless you
[48:52] come out and tell the truth and say,
[48:55] "Hey, listen,
[48:58] man." And there's good ways to do it,
[49:00] you know, light-heartedly. Man, I was
[49:03] such a fool back then. I was so
[49:05] arrogant. I was so And then you'll
[49:08] you'll actually when you start telling
[49:09] the truth, you'll see the people around
[49:11] you start to relax. you know, and
[49:13] they'll they start to feel, oh, okay,
[49:16] you know what? I did the same thing. You
[49:19] don't feel bad about that. That's
[49:21] amazing how truth can actually set you
[49:23] free.
[49:24] So now you're in this marriage with
[49:26] these children and your wife who's
[49:29] frustrated
[49:31] and you then lose all the energy to keep
[49:33] up with the lies because the lies have
[49:35] been weighing you down so much and you
[49:38] start to fall apart in front of
[49:39] everybody who thought they knew you. and
[49:42] you let yourself go, but now people
[49:45] still expect you to be who you used to
[49:48] be and you're not interested in being
[49:51] that again because it's too tiring,
[49:53] right? Life becomes frustrating. You
[49:56] snap time and time again. You grow into
[49:59] an insufferable, unhelp, unhappy,
[50:02] grumbling, cheating, lying person, and
[50:06] the worst thing, a great pretender in
[50:09] church.
[50:10] Even worse, if you are even actually a
[50:14] good person inside that little soul,
[50:16] then your life in the message becomes
[50:18] such a struggle because you really want
[50:21] to please God and you just don't know
[50:23] how to anymore because you don't know
[50:26] how to get out of the very cage that the
[50:29] lies in your life in the past locked you
[50:32] into. And then you know what's going to
[50:35] happen if you don't get out of it? that
[50:37] same cycle of lies that started with
[50:40] you, you're just going to continue it by
[50:43] passing it on to your kids. Cuz if you
[50:45] don't break it, you're going to start
[50:47] grooming your little children into
[50:50] another cycle of lies. I want you to to
[50:52] do this exercise. Look at the people you
[50:55] know in the world, your relatives, your
[50:57] family, your schoolmates, your college
[51:00] um university friends.
[51:03] um
[51:05] um uh who your work colleagues. I I want
[51:09] you to think of those people who don't
[51:11] have the word. Think of it in your mind
[51:13] right now and see if you can name five
[51:16] people who are happily married, have no
[51:21] addictions to any substances, who don't
[51:23] fight like rabbit dogs. And you know,
[51:28] name one person
[51:32] who is absolutely trustworthy who will
[51:35] lay their life down for you and you can
[51:37] lay their life your life down for them.
[51:39] Can you name one person outside in the
[51:41] world
[51:43] other than your brothers and sisters in
[51:44] the church and even that too? Some of it
[51:46] is sketchy. Can you name five
[51:50] trustworthy people in this world that
[51:52] you know you can always come to and will
[51:55] always tell you the truth? unfiltered
[51:57] truth, uncompromising, unadulterated
[52:00] truth, and they're not going to
[52:02] manipulate it. Can you? Is it your
[52:04] mother, your father? Who are they? Who
[52:07] are these people in your life who you
[52:09] know you can trust with your utmost
[52:12] thoughts and they won't manipulate you
[52:14] or use it to dominate you? Can you name
[52:17] them? [snorts]
[52:19] Some of you older people cannot even
[52:21] trust your children who are adults and
[52:23] married. Now, I know this because I I I
[52:27] counsel people. I I see people's lives
[52:30] and problems. I'm I'm telling you,
[52:32] nobody can name. Most people cannot even
[52:34] name one person
[52:37] that you can have full confidence in and
[52:40] that that you know they'll never let you
[52:41] down. Look at their if if you know any
[52:44] married people in the world look at
[52:46] their children and ask yourself are
[52:48] there the reason why I'm telling you
[52:50] especially you young people you you
[52:52] might be hearing the message and you're
[52:54] complaining about your life things in my
[52:56] home you know we got so many
[52:58] restrictions we don't have this we don't
[53:00] have that and you know our friends are
[53:03] having fun really
[53:06] look at your friends lives and ask
[53:08] yourself if your friends are living by
[53:11] truth or lie eyes. Consider this deeply
[53:15] and look at that Syrophanician woman who
[53:17] said truth Lord and demonology was
[53:21] broken without even a prayer, without
[53:23] even laying of hands, without anointing
[53:25] with oil, just accepting truth. That's
[53:28] how powerful it is. That's God saints.
[53:32] So at which point, I want you to
[53:35] consider this. At which point in your
[53:37] development
[53:39] will you now young people be able to
[53:43] make the change from this nature of
[53:46] lying and deception and manipulation?
[53:49] How can you do this by your own
[53:51] strength? Can you suddenly one day
[53:53] decide I just want to live by truth? I
[53:56] just I just want to let go. I just want
[53:59] can you have the strength of character?
[54:03] You know the the prophet says
[54:07] you can never fully have the Holy Ghost
[54:11] or have the Holy Ghost in its fullness
[54:14] until you separate
[54:16] from all unbelief.
[54:20] Right? And and that's our
[54:22] [clears throat] struggle all of us
[54:23] myself included
[54:26] uh to separate from all every aspect of
[54:32] manipulation, deception, lies,
[54:35] self-preservation.
[54:38] I'm never going to get the Holy Ghost in
[54:40] its fullness until I can do that. And
[54:44] here's the here's the truth. You can't
[54:47] do that by yourself. This is why the
[54:50] word is salvation to us to save us from
[54:54] ourselves. Stop even blaming the devil
[54:58] like he's somebody who is sneaking
[55:01] around at you and uh coming to try and
[55:04] No, you are using the nature that he has
[55:08] planted into this world to corrupt
[55:10] yourself. You were doing it by your own
[55:12] free will. You were accepting lies. You
[55:14] were speaking lies. You were living a
[55:16] lie.
[55:17] And this living with lies causes the
[55:21] worst thing, an identity crisis
[55:25] because you don't know who you are. Most
[55:27] of us are going to take years to find
[55:29] out who I actually am. Who am I, Lord?
[55:33] Is that who I was? Was that what I was
[55:36] portraying myself to my parents as when
[55:39] I was growing up? Is that who I am? Was
[55:42] I that person? Who am I portraying to my
[55:44] boss, my colleagues?
[55:47] Who is it? Who am I? So if you come
[55:51] through all this development and you
[55:53] have grown into a young adult, you'll
[55:56] probably become so accustomed to living
[55:59] influenced by lies and untruths that you
[56:02] are a different person to every person
[56:04] that meets you. And what am I saying to
[56:07] you? You are literally living with a
[56:11] mental disorder of multi-personality.
[56:15] uh uh disorder. You you are somebody
[56:18] else to different groups of people. So
[56:21] you are a you are one person to your
[56:23] parents. You are another person at
[56:25] church. You are to different parts of
[56:28] the world. You have several ways that
[56:30] you portray yourself. So much so you can
[56:33] actually see people's speech change when
[56:36] they are with different people. You very
[56:38] rarely find people who speak exactly
[56:41] like you speak to your wife in a certain
[56:43] way and you speak to this one in a
[56:44] certain way and that one in a certain
[56:45] way but you literally are changing a
[56:49] personality with different people and
[56:52] that that's very stressful, right? And
[56:56] um you then live with regret so often
[57:01] because you know that's not who you
[57:03] really want to be. you're to your
[57:05] parents. You really just want to be
[57:08] open, honest. This is who I am. Mom and
[57:10] dad, this is who I am. Teacher,
[57:13] boss,
[57:15] colleagues, whoever, this is who I am. I
[57:18] I'm just so tired of keeping up
[57:19] appearances, right? And you live with
[57:22] regret so often because you know that's
[57:26] not who you really want to be, right?
[57:29] And you have so many personalities that
[57:32] you portray that now you don't know
[57:35] which one to pick to be you. That's why
[57:39] I say it's an identity crisis.
[57:42] You uh you get offended because people
[57:45] don't understand you and don't get what
[57:48] you mean. But how can they get to know
[57:51] who you are when you don't even know
[57:53] which personality to pick for yourself?
[57:55] It's confusing for us, right? So if you
[57:59] are in an age group where you are now a
[58:02] young adult
[58:04] uh you are where you can still bring a
[58:06] change to your life. For us who are who
[58:08] are older people middle-aged people it's
[58:11] harder for us to change when we are
[58:14] older. And but you know what I find we
[58:18] adults are even more desperate to change
[58:21] completely
[58:22] than the younger ones. The younger ones
[58:24] just are trying to double down and claim
[58:27] this is who I am and you know I don't
[58:29] need to change. But no, what I'm saying
[58:32] to you young people is this is the time
[58:34] of your life where you are going to
[58:37] establish who you are in the future.
[58:39] This is the time of your life where you
[58:40] can choose to live by truth and
[58:43] establish yourself in the truth so that
[58:46] you can set your life up for a positive
[58:48] outcome.
[58:52] Um saints
[58:55] the truth is without the Holy Spirit you
[58:58] can never willfully turn away from wrong
[59:01] things.
[59:02] uh without the Holy Spirit we don't have
[59:04] the ability to turn things around to
[59:06] seek the truth to live the truth to get
[59:10] rid of all the lies in our life we just
[59:12] cannot do it without him without the
[59:14] word we cannot we we don't have the
[59:16] mental acuity we don't have the uh the
[59:19] the the strength of character to do it
[59:21] on our own that's why we need the word
[59:24] that's why we come back to church that's
[59:26] why we come back to the word constantly
[59:28] amen
[59:30] I want to get to this next part
[59:33] which I've called the morally gray area.
[59:38] And um I want to show you that deception
[59:44] um let's just share the screen.
[59:50] Deception has become the modern and
[59:54] chosen way of life. There used to be a
[59:58] clear boundary between truth and lies.
[1:00:01] once. But that is no more. We no longer
[1:00:05] have just the two categories of truth
[1:00:08] and lies. But we have this morally
[1:00:11] comfortable gray category of misleading
[1:00:15] statements and behaviors that is not
[1:00:18] actually the truth but just falls short
[1:00:20] of a lie. Right? So, if you look at this
[1:00:24] diagram I've I've put up for you on the
[1:00:26] screen, you'll see I've put the black
[1:00:30] part as lies and the white part is
[1:00:32] truth. And when you combine lies and
[1:00:36] truth together, you get this morally
[1:00:38] gray area. Okay? So this is
[1:00:43] uh where humans today find themselves
[1:00:48] living and actually more good people
[1:00:51] find themselves living in this morally
[1:00:53] gray area.
[1:00:55] You know naturally bad people don't
[1:00:57] care. They can live in absolute
[1:01:00] total lies.
[1:01:02] Now you are
[1:01:04] highly intelligent beings today
[1:01:08] as compared with people
[1:01:10] a thousand years ago.
[1:01:13] You are even more so intelligent than
[1:01:16] previous generations of the past just of
[1:01:19] the recent past. You have greater access
[1:01:21] to information
[1:01:23] good and bad information and uh the
[1:01:27] previous you know information that the
[1:01:29] previous generation did not have. You
[1:01:32] have the message. You have the Bible.
[1:01:33] You have You have it on your phones,
[1:01:35] your tablets, your PCs. You have
[1:01:37] Wikipedia. You have search engines of
[1:01:41] all kinds. You have social media. You
[1:01:44] have greater access to Bible
[1:01:46] commentaries. Uh the world of your
[1:01:49] generation has become so liberal, so
[1:01:52] free with sinfulness that it is
[1:01:54] literally making the word of God seem
[1:01:56] like an extreme.
[1:01:58] So it's like to tell you not to dress in
[1:02:02] a sexually seductive way looks like an
[1:02:05] extreme. But just 200 years ago, women
[1:02:08] were dressing covered up, you know, not
[1:02:13] even 200 like 100 years ago, they were
[1:02:15] dressing all over the world. It wasn't
[1:02:18] it it wasn't even called message
[1:02:20] standards. It just simply was. This is
[1:02:23] how you dress. Men never ran around in
[1:02:26] shorts. Uh you know, they worked in the
[1:02:29] fields without their shirts and so on.
[1:02:32] But just a few hundred years ago,
[1:02:34] society knew truth. Today, if you go to
[1:02:39] our Durban beachfront, you're going to
[1:02:41] find scores and scores of naked people,
[1:02:45] right? And uh people just doing
[1:02:48] unrighteous things.
[1:02:50] Illegitimate children are going to be
[1:02:52] conceived. It's just it's it's insane
[1:02:55] what's going on. And because of how this
[1:02:59] generation has become so liberal,
[1:03:02] the word which is truth looks extreme,
[1:03:06] right? And it has forced you
[1:03:10] because because of that you are being
[1:03:13] forced to live in this gray area. And
[1:03:16] this gray area you are calling normal.
[1:03:21] So that
[1:03:23] We're living in this place so we can be
[1:03:25] accepted in the world and accepted in
[1:03:28] the message. And that's what I'm finding
[1:03:31] with message people today. You're
[1:03:34] finding it so stressful, so hard. And
[1:03:38] you know, I could tell you so many
[1:03:39] things. How do I go to uh my family's
[1:03:43] weddings and you know, I got to fit in.
[1:03:48] How can I go to my cousins parties and
[1:03:52] still be a believer? Uh listen, nobody's
[1:03:55] asking you to go there and stand there
[1:03:57] and start shouting out the word and
[1:03:59] condemning them and you know saying thus
[1:04:01] said the Lord, you're all going to hell,
[1:04:04] you know, and nobody's asking you to do
[1:04:06] that. That's behaving like a crazy
[1:04:07] person, right? But you don't have to
[1:04:12] uh start participating in worldliness
[1:04:15] just to fit in. And and I I find today,
[1:04:20] you know, I I don't know,
[1:04:23] people call me grumpy. I don't mind. But
[1:04:27] this is one of the reasons I I'm not
[1:04:28] going to be a person who goes somewhere
[1:04:31] and be something I'm not. I'm not going
[1:04:33] to go to some family function and act
[1:04:36] like them just to to make them feel
[1:04:38] good. I want to stand for the truth. I
[1:04:41] want to I'll be there. I'll shake their
[1:04:43] hands. I'll congratulate them. you know,
[1:04:45] well done on your marriage or well done
[1:04:47] on turning whatever 21 or something, but
[1:04:51] if you're going to play worldly music,
[1:04:52] I'm not going to dance to it. I'm sorry.
[1:04:54] This not who I am. I'm going to sit
[1:04:56] there and watch you dance and do all
[1:04:57] your stuff and whatever and I'll enjoy
[1:05:00] the food and I'll greet you and I'll be
[1:05:02] uh, you know, courteous and loving and,
[1:05:06] you know, hug all the relatives and but
[1:05:08] I'm not going to get involved. I'm not
[1:05:10] going to stand there and listen to
[1:05:11] filthy sexy jokes and uh, immoral
[1:05:14] things. I'm not going to laugh at your
[1:05:17] uh um uh filthy words. I'm not going to
[1:05:21] act like it's okay with me. I'm not
[1:05:23] going to sit there while you curse and
[1:05:26] be vulgar and and make you feel happy
[1:05:29] that you know it's okay. I can deal with
[1:05:31] that. I'm a cool guy. No, I'm not going
[1:05:33] to do that. I'm going to be me. You be
[1:05:36] you. I be me. This is how it is. And um
[1:05:40] you don't care about making me feel
[1:05:42] uncomfortable.
[1:05:44] Why should I go out of my way to make
[1:05:46] you feel like you're like you're like
[1:05:48] I'm comfortable with what you're saying
[1:05:50] to me? No, I'm not going to do that. So,
[1:05:52] I'm gonna end up looking like I'm
[1:05:54] grumpy. Well, right back at you, man.
[1:05:56] You look as grumpy as anything when I'm
[1:05:59] in your presence. So, you know, we're
[1:06:00] good. I don't really care. But my point
[1:06:04] is, people today living in this gray
[1:06:08] area, you do not realize how this is
[1:06:11] stressing you out because you're a child
[1:06:13] of God. Okay. So, I want to bring you to
[1:06:16] something
[1:06:18] uh a really astounding, astonishing
[1:06:22] scripture. Okay.
[1:06:24] And and I want to show you the
[1:06:26] difference between telling a lie. Um my
[1:06:31] I think I I
[1:06:34] must have missed this in my notes, but
[1:06:36] okay. Here's the difference between
[1:06:38] telling a lie and living by the truth.
[1:06:41] He that workketh deceit shall not dwell
[1:06:45] uh within my house. He that tellth lies
[1:06:48] shall not tarry in my sight. Right? So
[1:06:52] this is incredible. Uh
[1:06:56] uh he that workketh deceit shall not
[1:06:59] dwell. This is literally telling you
[1:07:01] that manipulation
[1:07:04] uh is going to cause you to actually
[1:07:07] leave the Lord's house.
[1:07:09] But the person that tells lies won't
[1:07:12] last.
[1:07:13] It's literally telling you if you live
[1:07:15] in a gray in that gray area, if you live
[1:07:17] in lies, if you live in this morally
[1:07:21] gray zone, you're not going to last
[1:07:23] long. You have to eventually move out of
[1:07:26] there into the light or else you will
[1:07:29] leave because it's going to get too
[1:07:31] pressurizing for you. Right? So, we need
[1:07:34] to really think about the saints.
[1:07:37] Now, I want I want us to focus on what
[1:07:40] salvation is really all about. Okay? And
[1:07:45] this is what's going to be uh so
[1:07:47] important to us. And I'll get to that a
[1:07:51] little later. But I want to uh it looks
[1:07:53] like I didn't put this here in my notes,
[1:07:56] but I want to share something with you
[1:07:58] uh to show you what what God really
[1:08:02] hates. And this is in Proverbsap 6-19.
[1:08:07] Uh so I'm just going to go to the
[1:08:10] message
[1:08:12] um and bring up that scripture
[1:08:16] uh so that we can we can have a look at
[1:08:18] that.
[1:08:21] Share the screen. Okay. Hope you can see
[1:08:23] that. Proverbs 6 verse 16 to 19. So this
[1:08:26] is an amazing scripture and I want you
[1:08:28] to to notice what the Lord speaks here.
[1:08:32] It's just something you need to read.
[1:08:35] um uh in with your families
[1:08:39] uh even at family altar
[1:08:41] um you know it's something you can
[1:08:43] discuss together I think it's something
[1:08:46] really amazing that all people uh in the
[1:08:51] message should really look at
[1:08:53] these six things doth the Lord hate
[1:08:58] yay seven are an abomination unto him so
[1:09:01] watch this
[1:09:03] is the only place in scripture where you
[1:09:05] get a ver a portion of scripture telling
[1:09:08] you what God what the spirit of truth
[1:09:11] hates. Right? There are six things he
[1:09:14] hates. But when you get the seventh, it
[1:09:18] becomes disgusting. An abomination means
[1:09:21] something disgusting, distasteful. All
[1:09:23] right, listen young people. A proud
[1:09:27] look. Number one, a lying tongue. Number
[1:09:32] two,
[1:09:33] hands that shed innocent blood. Number
[1:09:36] three, a heart that devises wicked
[1:09:39] imaginations. Right. Uh, number four.
[1:09:43] Number five, feet that be swift in
[1:09:46] running to mischief. Number six,
[1:09:50] uh, a false witness that speaketh lies
[1:09:53] and he that sweth discord among
[1:09:56] brethren. Right? Number six. So, and
[1:09:59] number seven. So, the way God puts it is
[1:10:02] the the word puts it is there are these
[1:10:04] six things that he hates
[1:10:07] and you're you're you're even okay
[1:10:10] there. But when you get to the seventh,
[1:10:13] it's just disgusting. It's an
[1:10:15] abomination to God, right?
[1:10:18] So number one, a proud look. Number two,
[1:10:21] a lying tongue. Number three, hands that
[1:10:23] shed innocent blood. Number four, a
[1:10:26] heart that devises wicked imaginations.
[1:10:30] Number five, feet that that are swift in
[1:10:33] running to mischief. Number six, a false
[1:10:35] witness that speaketh lies. And number
[1:10:39] seven, which is the abomination, he that
[1:10:41] sweth discord among brethren. Where else
[1:10:44] will you find in the scripture a place
[1:10:47] where God defines something he hates?
[1:10:51] Right? This is how simple it is. So
[1:10:55] how does God feel about you living in a
[1:10:58] gray area? Right? So I want to explain
[1:11:02] something to you and I want you to uh to
[1:11:04] look at these things. So let's look at a
[1:11:06] proud look. Right? What is that?
[1:11:09] Okay. So, and this is where you need to
[1:11:12] look at h who you are really and what
[1:11:14] your nature slowly becomes. Nothing that
[1:11:17] the world produces in this world gives
[1:11:20] you humility.
[1:11:22] It's not how you dress. It's not how you
[1:11:24] do your hair. It's how you project your
[1:11:27] spirit. You cannot let others see your
[1:11:30] mistakes to protect your image, your
[1:11:33] status in your social circles. You are
[1:11:36] every all those personalities you create
[1:11:39] is because of pride because it's it's
[1:11:43] given you a proud look. I've got to
[1:11:46] portray myself in a certain way to gain
[1:11:49] something, right? God hates that. God
[1:11:52] hates a proud look. I'm not saying you
[1:11:54] must walk around looking like a hobo.
[1:11:57] Okay? Be attractive. Be but be yourself.
[1:12:01] Don't hide behind a mask. Be yourself.
[1:12:05] Right. The second is a lying tongue.
[1:12:10] And and you've come to this place where
[1:12:11] you can no longer be completely honest
[1:12:14] with people. Not with parents, not with
[1:12:17] family, not with friends, not with the
[1:12:20] world. Everything you share with every
[1:12:24] person you live with is a halftruth.
[1:12:27] It's a lie. Even the songs of worship
[1:12:31] that we sing is a gray area because we
[1:12:34] sing things we don't even mean. Even our
[1:12:36] prayers are a gray area. When you get to
[1:12:39] a place when you even praying to God and
[1:12:42] you're using words thinking you are
[1:12:45] manipulating the spirit of God, just
[1:12:47] wake up, pinch yourself, knock yourself
[1:12:49] on the head with something and AND ASK
[1:12:51] YOURSELF, WHAT ARE YOU saying right now?
[1:12:53] What are you saying to the spirit of God
[1:12:55] right now? when you're in church and
[1:12:57] you're trying to use great words to to
[1:13:00] influence people or to make yourself
[1:13:03] look like something or you're you're
[1:13:05] somebody they ask you to open in prayer
[1:13:07] and you're trying to be something you're
[1:13:09] not or you're trying to bring in some
[1:13:11] kind of charisma, just knock yourself in
[1:13:14] the eye or something and AND ASK
[1:13:15] YOURSELF, WHAT are you doing? What are
[1:13:18] you doing? Why can you not just be
[1:13:21] yourself and speak to God? Talk to him.
[1:13:24] Drop everything else away. No
[1:13:26] manipulation, no deceit, no trying to be
[1:13:29] something in front of people, no trying
[1:13:31] to be any extra spiritual kind of
[1:13:33] person. Just talk to him in truth.
[1:13:40] This is a lying tongue. Nobody's
[1:13:42] nobody's saying you're you're you're,
[1:13:44] you know, telling lies all the time.
[1:13:46] This is what's what's what's been
[1:13:48] happening. It's a it's a tongue that is
[1:13:50] just not uh uh uh conducive anymore to
[1:13:55] to speaking the truth, to being honest
[1:13:57] with people. Hands that shed innocent
[1:14:00] blood. You're going to say, "Brother L,
[1:14:01] I don't I don't kill people. I don't
[1:14:03] murder people." Listen, because of what
[1:14:07] you are groomed to be, you have been
[1:14:09] groomed to be selfish. you are. So
[1:14:12] because you've you've taken on the
[1:14:13] mentality and the the lifestyle of being
[1:14:18] selfish, you your first reaction if
[1:14:22] someone comes against you is to cut them
[1:14:24] down to protect your own interest.
[1:14:27] You're going to cut them down. You your
[1:14:29] first thing is defensiveness and then
[1:14:31] attack. Oh, but I'm telling you this
[1:14:35] because you did this, but you also and
[1:14:37] you did this and you did this last and
[1:14:39] I'm going to tell them and I'm going to
[1:14:40] do that's shedding innocent blood. You
[1:14:44] become so desensitized. So, you don't
[1:14:47] care what you do with your life that
[1:14:49] causes other people to make mistakes or
[1:14:51] even backslide. You're going to do
[1:14:54] things to damage the lives of other
[1:14:56] people.
[1:14:58] That's shedding innocent blood and God
[1:15:00] hates it. How about a heart that devises
[1:15:03] wicked imaginations? I don't do that,
[1:15:06] brother Al. Because you know you put
[1:15:10] yourself first, you suspect others of
[1:15:13] being the same. So you believe everybody
[1:15:17] doesn't have good intentions and so why
[1:15:20] should I? And you develop a suspicious
[1:15:22] nature. So therefore, you get offended
[1:15:26] so easily. So whenever somebody's while
[1:15:29] they're talking to you, your mind is
[1:15:32] already thinking, how can I be cleverer?
[1:15:35] How can I be better? How can I
[1:15:37] manipulate this? How can I dominate
[1:15:39] this? Right? What's the point of it all,
[1:15:42] saints?
[1:15:44] Number five, feet that are swift in
[1:15:47] running to mischief. You say, "I don't
[1:15:50] do that. You know, I don't I'm not that
[1:15:52] kind of person." What are feet in the
[1:15:55] Bible? In the Bible, feet are a symbol
[1:15:57] of intentions, right? Having a nature
[1:16:01] that is addicted to drama and
[1:16:04] negativity, gossip.
[1:16:07] Listen, all of this comes from the realm
[1:16:09] of lies, which is fifth dimension, which
[1:16:11] is the devil. A desire to always cause a
[1:16:15] situation and encourage incitement of
[1:16:18] indifference. Always running to mischief
[1:16:22] is using your words, using your phone,
[1:16:25] using your text just to create drama, to
[1:16:29] be a part of the drama, to be a part of
[1:16:31] the gossip, to be a part of something
[1:16:33] that brings down somebody else. Just not
[1:16:36] living in the light. That's feet that
[1:16:38] run to mischief. God hates it. Number
[1:16:42] six,
[1:16:44] false witness that speaketh lies. That
[1:16:48] is like using you use your your feigned
[1:16:53] innocence and a victim-like nature to
[1:16:56] cause ill to come upon other people. You
[1:16:59] know, a false witness in the Bible is
[1:17:02] one of the commandments. Thou shalt not
[1:17:04] bear false witness against thy neighbor.
[1:17:07] Somebody calls you and asks you about
[1:17:09] somebody, your brother, your sister.
[1:17:13] Tell the truth. Just tell the truth.
[1:17:16] That's all. and tell your brothers and
[1:17:17] sisters, I'm going to tell the truth.
[1:17:19] Some of this is going to get us into
[1:17:21] trouble. Some of this is going to get
[1:17:22] you in trouble, more you than me, or
[1:17:25] more me than you. But tell the truth.
[1:17:28] Don't be a false witness. There's
[1:17:31] nothing good going to come out of
[1:17:32] because when they find out you're a
[1:17:34] liar, the the retribution or rather the
[1:17:37] condemnation is going to be double. It's
[1:17:40] going to be worse. You rather tell the
[1:17:43] truth, be accountable for what happened,
[1:17:46] pay the price, and live in peace
[1:17:48] thereafter. Right? A false witness and
[1:17:51] bearing false witness against that's the
[1:17:54] worst thing you can do. I tell you to to
[1:17:57] go and and speak lies about your brother
[1:18:00] and sister in Christ. That's that's like
[1:18:03] that that is Judas. That is bearing
[1:18:05] false witness. Okay?
[1:18:08] And then you get to this. This is not
[1:18:11] even false witness. So So what are we
[1:18:13] what is all this about? This is all
[1:18:14] about the realm of lies, right? You
[1:18:18] you've been if you've been thinking the
[1:18:19] devil is some scaly creature with a tail
[1:18:22] and a fork and you know living under the
[1:18:25] ground amongst lava pits and no saints.
[1:18:29] This is what's right among us. This is
[1:18:32] the devil.
[1:18:34] This is the devil that's not being
[1:18:35] preached about in churches. This is the
[1:18:38] devil that's not being targeted in your
[1:18:40] daily life. Yeah. You know what? You can
[1:18:43] all fuss and fight and argue about the
[1:18:45] coming of the Lord and the seventh seal
[1:18:47] being open and the open book and you
[1:18:49] know whether he's coming in a corporal
[1:18:52] body or he's not or you whether the
[1:18:54] resurrected saint wonderful. Oh, you
[1:18:57] look so great. You know all the quotes.
[1:19:00] You can put all the doctrines together.
[1:19:03] But lies are all around you in your
[1:19:07] mouth, in your life with your family, in
[1:19:10] the way you dress, in the person you are
[1:19:12] at work, person you are at school. It's
[1:19:14] it's swirling around you. It's in your
[1:19:17] essence. It's in your thoughts. And yet
[1:19:21] you can quote the message to your
[1:19:23] heart's content. You can be among the
[1:19:25] people who discuss doctrines and fight
[1:19:28] against ministries and fight against min
[1:19:30] and correct this one, correct that one,
[1:19:32] but your lives are surrounded by
[1:19:34] propaganda, advertisement, and darkness.
[1:19:38] And you don't realize you've been more
[1:19:42] accustomed to living with
[1:19:43] fifthdimensional influence rather than
[1:19:46] the seventh dimension. The seventh part
[1:19:48] here, he says, is he that sweth discord
[1:19:51] among brethren. This is the part if you
[1:19:54] study all this, you take these this one
[1:19:57] these few scriptures I showed you and
[1:19:58] apply that into the message demonology,
[1:20:01] you come to enticing spirits. And
[1:20:03] brother Maram said, he that saw a
[1:20:04] discord among brethren said that's
[1:20:06] sulfuric acid in the church.
[1:20:09] That's enticing spirits. What is this?
[1:20:13] You make others look bad to make
[1:20:17] yourself look good and speak against
[1:20:20] other people in the church, other
[1:20:23] brothers, other ministers and speak
[1:20:25] against them and why uh against people
[1:20:30] in the church and why it's it's not for
[1:20:32] you, right? So you want them to look bad
[1:20:36] so that you can look good and then
[1:20:39] you're actually messing up the
[1:20:41] relationship between that brother and
[1:20:43] that brother or that sister and that
[1:20:45] sister. You are sewing a seed of discord
[1:20:47] between them and secretly you want e
[1:20:51] both of them to be on your side. You're
[1:20:54] literally playing a game with people's
[1:20:57] lives where you're pitting them against
[1:20:59] each other while keeping good relations
[1:21:02] with both of them. That is disgusting in
[1:21:07] the sight of God.
[1:21:10] This to me is everyone's picking on
[1:21:12] dressing and uh you know the way people
[1:21:16] their hair is done or how high their
[1:21:19] heels are, how long their skirts are or
[1:21:23] what their face looks like or whether
[1:21:26] they go and do this or whether they they
[1:21:28] listen to this music or how lively they
[1:21:31] are in their church or how quiet they
[1:21:33] are. All of this stuff. But when you
[1:21:36] live like this, a person who pits two
[1:21:39] people against one one another while you
[1:21:42] are maintaining good relations with him.
[1:21:46] This is an abomination to the Lord. This
[1:21:49] is disgusting to his nature, to his
[1:21:53] nature of truth. Can you honestly say
[1:21:56] this behavior is influenced by the
[1:21:59] spirit of truth? When you read all that,
[1:22:01] we want to see that it's God, the spirit
[1:22:05] of truth that condemns this behavior and
[1:22:08] not even the message. You young people
[1:22:12] can fight and and fuss
[1:22:16] against the message. It's not even the
[1:22:19] message. It by that I'm just trying to
[1:22:21] point out to me the message is the Bible
[1:22:23] and the Bible is the message. It's all
[1:22:25] the message. I don't I don't see any
[1:22:27] difference. But I'm I'm trying to tell
[1:22:30] you because you're still developing and
[1:22:32] if you get upset with the prophet and
[1:22:34] what he says,
[1:22:36] well, how can you argue with those
[1:22:37] scriptures from Proverbs 16? What are
[1:22:39] you going to say then? Right? You may
[1:22:42] blame the message all you want. It's too
[1:22:45] strict. It's caging me. And look at the
[1:22:48] reality of what is happening. I just
[1:22:52] want to say it this way.
[1:22:54] You need to to understand God hates
[1:22:57] pretense. God hates
[1:23:00] deceitfulness. It's not in his nature.
[1:23:03] The nature of God is truth. It's not
[1:23:06] deceitfulness. It's not pretense.
[1:23:09] We don't go to church and become actors,
[1:23:12] good actors.
[1:23:13] You say, "This is me, Lord." You know,
[1:23:18] this is who I am. You don't say, "This
[1:23:21] is me. Deal with it." Right? Let's see
[1:23:25] if you can deal with it. Right?
[1:23:29] You young people,
[1:23:32] brother Al is not going to be around
[1:23:33] forever. If God carries for a while,
[1:23:37] there's going to be a church of
[1:23:39] tomorrow. Who will you choose to be your
[1:23:42] pastors,
[1:23:44] your deacons, your song leaders, your
[1:23:46] musicians? What on what basis are you
[1:23:49] going to choose these people?
[1:23:52] Will you meet the conditions to lead?
[1:23:56] Will young men find girls who are not
[1:23:59] master manipulators to be pastors,
[1:24:02] wives, deacons wives, trustes wives?
[1:24:05] Young ladies, will you find men who are
[1:24:07] just players? Are they going to be the
[1:24:09] leaders of your churches? Do you even
[1:24:12] care whether there will be a church once
[1:24:14] all your elders have died off? What are
[1:24:16] you going to do? You have to make a
[1:24:18] decision now. Are you content to just
[1:24:21] stay along this path that you're on
[1:24:23] hoping for the best or are you desiring
[1:24:27] to make a change today?
[1:24:29] The difference between telling a lie and
[1:24:32] living a lie is [clears throat]
[1:24:35] we we don't want you to go away thinking
[1:24:39] this is easy. I just won't tell lies
[1:24:41] anymore and I'm and I'm good. No.
[1:24:46] Telling a lie is one thing. Living the
[1:24:50] lie is the same as telling a lie. You
[1:24:54] may be living by the way Hollywood
[1:24:57] defines something, the way the world
[1:25:00] defines something, the way uh the the
[1:25:03] internet defines something. And if you
[1:25:05] are living by that way, you are as good
[1:25:08] as telling a lie. That's ultimately what
[1:25:10] you're doing. You're manifesting
[1:25:12] something that is not the truth. It's
[1:25:14] not of God, right? And you will not last
[1:25:20] in his house if you feel comfortable in
[1:25:23] the gray area. He that tells lies shall
[1:25:27] not tarry in my sight. You will not last
[1:25:29] long.
[1:25:31] Okay. So, we come to what is salvation
[1:25:35] about saints? And we're going to bring
[1:25:38] this to a close now. Salvation has
[1:25:41] become a thing that we understand from
[1:25:44] the Pentecostal point of view. That's
[1:25:46] what's been fed to us. The way they
[1:25:48] teach it to you is just another lie of
[1:25:50] the devil. Okay. The word salvation
[1:25:53] comes from the word salva.
[1:25:56] Sodzo,
[1:25:58] ointment, to heal. So what are you being
[1:26:01] healed of?
[1:26:04] Now you can define it. What am I being
[1:26:07] healed of? Some of you, this is why I I
[1:26:11] I wanted I felt in my heart to share all
[1:26:14] this with you and with young people. A
[1:26:16] lot of this we did with you in a in a
[1:26:20] youth meeting many years ago
[1:26:23] long before co
[1:26:25] um because some of you want to get
[1:26:29] baptized which we will be doing in in
[1:26:32] the coming year the earlier um in
[1:26:34] January.
[1:26:36] And I want you to think about this. Some
[1:26:38] of you born in the message, you haven't
[1:26:40] really done anything wrong. You haven't
[1:26:43] maybe
[1:26:45] you haven't smoked, drank, done drugs,
[1:26:47] fornicated. You haven't done that. And
[1:26:49] then you're going to be asked to repent
[1:26:52] and
[1:26:53] uh submit yourself to God and to the
[1:26:55] word.
[1:26:57] And you don't realize that salvation is
[1:27:01] healing from the spirit of lies.
[1:27:05] And that we come into this world
[1:27:07] speaking lies. And most of us think I
[1:27:11] don't speak lies. I always try to tell
[1:27:14] the truth. No. Speaking lies is living
[1:27:17] deceptively.
[1:27:19] Living manipulatively,
[1:27:21] right? And you some of you will be
[1:27:24] listening to this saying, "Brother L,
[1:27:25] how how do we ever get out of that? This
[1:27:29] is too hard for us to bear." No, it's
[1:27:31] not. You just submit yourself to truth.
[1:27:34] Submit yourself to the word. Fall in
[1:27:36] love with the word. And he takes care of
[1:27:38] that. We are every day being saved.
[1:27:43] Salvation is a constant process of being
[1:27:47] healed from the effect of lies and
[1:27:49] deceit. This is your real enemy. I'm not
[1:27:52] telling you anything that's not the
[1:27:53] message. Brother Brandham says, "I come
[1:27:55] to realize my greatest enemy is William
[1:27:58] Brham." What does he mean by that?
[1:28:01] Right? This is the truth that we are
[1:28:03] telling you. All the scriptures on truth
[1:28:06] and lies tells us that our sin is not
[1:28:10] really literal wrongs, wrong things that
[1:28:13] we did. We can give up doing wrong
[1:28:16] things. It's actually easier,
[1:28:19] right? What we never give up easy is
[1:28:22] living by the spirit of lies. That's
[1:28:25] actually what our sin, doubt, and
[1:28:28] unbelief is. You can give up smoking.
[1:28:32] You can't give up the desire for smoking
[1:28:34] that easy. You can give up dressing
[1:28:37] weird. But the desire is very hard too.
[1:28:41] This is why Christ focuses in and says,
[1:28:43] "You say you didn't kill, but you got
[1:28:46] angry with your brother without a cause.
[1:28:48] You have killed." See? So that's what we
[1:28:53] actually need salvation from. We need
[1:28:54] salvation from the nature of lies. We we
[1:28:58] say we are born again. We say I'm
[1:29:00] starting to uh to to my spirit o of an
[1:29:05] infant from scratch. I'm starting from
[1:29:07] scratch. I'm I'm following the truth for
[1:29:09] my day. That's what we are saying.
[1:29:11] That's what being born again is. I my my
[1:29:14] spirit is being born again. I'm I'm
[1:29:16] bringing it back away from lies. I'm
[1:29:18] bringing it to truth. I'm subjecting it
[1:29:20] under truth. I'm putting it under the
[1:29:22] light of his word. I want to try and
[1:29:24] live in the light. That's what we're
[1:29:26] saying. That's what when you come to be
[1:29:28] baptized, that's what I want. Every day
[1:29:30] after I'm baptized, young person, you
[1:29:33] should be desiring. I want to know the
[1:29:35] word. I want to know the word more than
[1:29:37] before. I want to live in that word. I
[1:29:38] want to study it. I want to be in
[1:29:40] church. I want to fellowship in it.
[1:29:42] That's what I want. That's what your
[1:29:43] desire ought to be. That's more than
[1:29:46] just a Pentecostal experience of
[1:29:47] shouting and screaming and speaking with
[1:29:49] tongues and prophesying and having
[1:29:51] dreams. That's what we want to see
[1:29:53] coming from people. Amen.
[1:29:56] Uh let's read this
[1:29:59] this quote.
[1:30:01] Um there's just two quotes here I think
[1:30:04] before we close.
[1:30:07] Yeah.
[1:30:09] So
[1:30:14] what is salvation all about?
[1:30:17] What happens when I'm born again? Right?
[1:30:20] Spoken word is the original seed.
[1:30:21] Paragraph 122. The prophet is saying,
[1:30:25] "Then except you be except a man be born
[1:30:27] again, why must he be born again? He's
[1:30:30] dead. The flesh he's in. He is He's
[1:30:33] hybrid. He's got to be born again. Why?
[1:30:36] Why? He was born in sin from Eve's sin,
[1:30:40] shaped in iniquity, come to the world
[1:30:43] speaking lies. He's a liar to begin
[1:30:47] with." Listen, the prophet is not saying
[1:30:49] you're a you're an adulterer.
[1:30:52] You're a you're a smoker. You're a
[1:30:55] drinker.
[1:30:56] You come into the world speaking li your
[1:30:58] first issue is lies.
[1:31:01] He's a liar to begin with. No matter how
[1:31:04] smart, educated, what more he is, he's a
[1:31:09] liar.
[1:31:13] Spoken word is your original seed. Um
[1:31:17] I think that should have been
[1:31:20] Oh, communion. Oh, we still we're still
[1:31:22] reading on. Sorry. The Bible says he is
[1:31:24] he's a liar, right? How holy his parents
[1:31:26] was or anything about it, he's a liar to
[1:31:29] begin with. That's pretty flat. In other
[1:31:32] words, brother is saying that's the
[1:31:34] brutal truth, right? Like Christ is
[1:31:36] saying you're a dog.
[1:31:39] But that's what God said. Uh-huh. Let
[1:31:43] every man's word be a lie and mine be
[1:31:46] true. anything that comes from his lips
[1:31:49] contrary to deny his word or put it in
[1:31:53] some other race or some other generation
[1:31:56] or whatever it is it is he's a liar.
[1:32:01] Okay. The message communion
[1:32:05] is paragraph 44 45 I was saying this
[1:32:08] taking for myself like you was going to
[1:32:10] say William Brandham well 40 years ago
[1:32:12] the William Brandham it isn't the same
[1:32:14] one tonight if somebody back there could
[1:32:17] si would say William Brham he was a rank
[1:32:19] rascal see because I was born of Charles
[1:32:23] and Ella Brandham in their nature I was
[1:32:26] a sinner I came to the world a liar and
[1:32:30] all the habits of the world laid right
[1:32:33] in me. There saints, here's the prophet
[1:32:35] telling you exactly what we've been
[1:32:37] telling you all this time today. Right?
[1:32:41] I came all the habits of the world laid
[1:32:43] in me. See, I just broke that statement
[1:32:45] down to you practically so you
[1:32:48] understood that you were groomed by lies
[1:32:51] that becomes a part of you cuz you're
[1:32:52] living in this world. Right? I'm I
[1:32:55] haven't been telling you psychology or
[1:32:56] anything other than breaking down the
[1:32:59] one statement there. Brother Mary's
[1:33:00] saying all the habits of the world laid
[1:33:04] right in me. I came to the world a liar.
[1:33:09] But down in there too, glory to God, was
[1:33:13] another nature present. See,
[1:33:16] predestinated
[1:33:17] was in there by God in the same body.
[1:33:22] See, two natures in there. Well, I only
[1:33:25] catered to one. As it growed, I gooed as
[1:33:29] a baby. Da da. First thing you know, I
[1:33:32] become a liar. Become everything else
[1:33:35] that's a sinner. Because I raised up
[1:33:38] that way. But down in there was a speck
[1:33:42] of life all the time. Glory to God.
[1:33:47] Saints, there's our hope. This is the
[1:33:49] truth, right? Being a believer, there is
[1:33:53] a gene seed in your soul, young people,
[1:33:55] that has been laying there dormant for
[1:33:58] many years. It is that sense inside of
[1:34:00] you. That's what we were telling the the
[1:34:02] little children at Sunday school.
[1:34:03] There's these two voices. See, again,
[1:34:06] we're telling you, brother Madam is
[1:34:08] telling there are two natures inside of
[1:34:10] you. And and one is tending to truth,
[1:34:13] one is tending to lies. And you've got
[1:34:15] whenever you're in a situation you are
[1:34:18] presented there are those two voices
[1:34:20] present. And it is that inside you even
[1:34:25] though you were brought up in this world
[1:34:27] of lies there's a sense inside you that
[1:34:30] warned you every time you lied and and
[1:34:33] there's that sense that makes you feel
[1:34:35] bad about it. Even though you go and you
[1:34:36] tell your friends I told them this and I
[1:34:38] did that but inside you something is
[1:34:40] saying you're not a good person. what
[1:34:43] you did there was not right. Some that
[1:34:45] that little something that little voice
[1:34:47] inside is telling you you shouldn't have
[1:34:49] done that. And if you didn't have it,
[1:34:52] you wouldn't feel bad about it. But
[1:34:54] because you have it, you know there's
[1:34:57] something inside there. There's some
[1:34:59] presence of God inside, some spirit of
[1:35:02] truth inside that's telling you you
[1:35:04] shouldn't have done that. You need to
[1:35:06] make this right. When you are born again
[1:35:09] is when the spirit of truth begins to
[1:35:11] grow in you. That little gene seed, that
[1:35:14] little speck of life starts to grow. And
[1:35:17] the more the truth grows, the more it's
[1:35:20] going to challenge you. The more it's
[1:35:21] going to convict you, the more it's
[1:35:23] going to make you change and break away
[1:35:25] from all those habits that's been laid
[1:35:27] in you. Like the prophet said, the
[1:35:28] spirit is constantly forcing you to be
[1:35:31] honest with your feelings, your
[1:35:33] intentions. And after years, it causes
[1:35:35] you to become so honest about everything
[1:35:38] because it makes it makes you a true
[1:35:41] worshipper. It makes you stand in
[1:35:42] church, close your eyes, forget about
[1:35:45] people around you. Right now, young
[1:35:47] people, you don't want to do that. You
[1:35:48] don't want to say amen. You don't want
[1:35:50] to raise your hands. You don't want to
[1:35:52] close your eyes and look a mess. You you
[1:35:55] want to protect an image. You want to
[1:35:57] protect something. You want to not look
[1:35:59] foolish. You want to not look like like
[1:36:02] uh somebody might criticize me for what
[1:36:04] I'm what I'm doing. You're trying to
[1:36:06] protect something. You're just
[1:36:08] succumbing to that nature. But one of
[1:36:11] these days, you're going to break out of
[1:36:12] that and you're going to raise your
[1:36:14] hand. You're going to say amen to the
[1:36:16] word. You're going to be somebody who's
[1:36:17] going to agree in your spirit and it's
[1:36:20] going to show out. You're going to break
[1:36:21] out crying and say, "Thank you, Lord,
[1:36:23] for speaking to me today." you you're
[1:36:25] going to you're going to become a
[1:36:26] worshipper one day that's going to just
[1:36:29] stand in God's presence and feel the
[1:36:31] rain of his holy spirit touching you and
[1:36:34] and falling down upon you and just going
[1:36:36] to raise your hand and say praise be to
[1:36:38] God hallelujah glory to God you are
[1:36:41] worthy to be praised you are going to be
[1:36:43] that person and you're going to break
[1:36:44] free and you're going to know that
[1:36:46] you're free that's because that little
[1:36:48] gene seed inside is growing and growing
[1:36:50] and it only grows because of truth
[1:36:53] because truth is presenting itself to
[1:36:55] you and filling you with light and all
[1:36:57] darkness is disappearing. Praise be to
[1:37:00] God. This spirit is constantly forcing
[1:37:03] you to be honest with your feelings and
[1:37:05] it's going to cause you to become so
[1:37:07] honest about everything because it makes
[1:37:09] you realize there is only one way that
[1:37:11] man should live and that is by the
[1:37:14] truth. Man shall not live by bread alone
[1:37:16] but by every word that proceeds out of
[1:37:19] the mouth of God. You don't have time
[1:37:22] anymore young people. Why? Why are we
[1:37:24] speaking to you this way in this time?
[1:37:26] You just simply do not have time
[1:37:28] anymore. Um I had more time when I was
[1:37:32] growing up as a teenager. Um because the
[1:37:35] world was not as liberal around me. Uh
[1:37:39] not as free with sinfulness. But you
[1:37:42] will be deformed by lies much faster
[1:37:45] than I would have ever been in my day as
[1:37:47] a teenager. And even uh well my parents
[1:37:51] they I don't know they they had
[1:37:53] Woodstock and rock music and things like
[1:37:55] that and I I I didn't even live in that
[1:37:58] kind of time. So, um, I I did this
[1:38:01] before. As a quick comparison, when I
[1:38:04] was a child, if I had to go and watch a
[1:38:07] movie, I had to sneak into my neighbor's
[1:38:10] house to go watch a movie and and lie to
[1:38:12] my dad or something and go watch He-Man
[1:38:14] and the Masters of the Universe or
[1:38:16] something or, you know, whatever it was.
[1:38:19] Uh, and then come back and lie about it
[1:38:21] or or or either tell them the truth and,
[1:38:24] you know, and and and get a reprimanding
[1:38:26] or something. But you you can do
[1:38:31] I don't know I cannot even count how
[1:38:33] many movies you can do in less than one
[1:38:35] week or in one day. Uh where I would
[1:38:40] probably if I could sneak into my
[1:38:42] friend's house and try to watch a movie
[1:38:44] once a year when I was growing up as a
[1:38:46] teenager. Now, why am I telling you this
[1:38:49] is because all all of the movies that
[1:38:52] you watch, all that you consume on the
[1:38:55] internet today,
[1:38:57] don't don't kid yourself. It's so filled
[1:39:00] with lies and deception and manipulation
[1:39:03] and you don't realize how it's hurting
[1:39:05] your little fragile spirit and soul.
[1:39:08] Don't kid Don't kid yourself. Don't you
[1:39:11] go you go and watch all these stuff and
[1:39:13] don't think it's not affecting you. It's
[1:39:15] affecting you. I can see it affecting
[1:39:17] it's affecting your speech. It's
[1:39:19] affecting how you read the Bible, how
[1:39:21] you interpret the message, how your
[1:39:23] reactions with with people, your your
[1:39:26] the way you conduct yourself at work,
[1:39:28] the way you conduct yourself at school.
[1:39:29] I can see it. It's there. It's evident.
[1:39:31] It's affecting you. It's infiltrating
[1:39:33] you. It's making you become something
[1:39:35] that you're observing. your manner of
[1:39:37] speech, your your your actions, your
[1:39:40] manners toward other people, it's
[1:39:43] affecting you and you don't realize
[1:39:45] you're breeding it now. It's not even
[1:39:47] your parents and other people as much as
[1:39:48] what you are consuming. This is why I'm
[1:39:51] saying I I feel so bad for you and I
[1:39:53] feel terrified for you because I didn't
[1:39:56] grow up this with with what you are
[1:39:58] growing up with today and that the times
[1:40:00] have changed so much that you just don't
[1:40:02] have a chance. You don't have time to
[1:40:04] catch up after you've already been so
[1:40:08] badly bombarded and and damaged by what
[1:40:12] this world is throwing at you 24/7.
[1:40:15] Right? So, in closing, I want to I want
[1:40:19] to let you see why we are in the
[1:40:21] message. I'm not some duped brainwashed
[1:40:25] fool. I'm not here doing this because I
[1:40:28] get I get something out of it as in
[1:40:31] there's something that I gain. No, more
[1:40:33] than likely more people are going to
[1:40:35] hate me for what I'm what I say. More
[1:40:38] than likely more people are going to
[1:40:40] disregard and it's going to happen.
[1:40:42] Putting myself out on YouTube and stuff
[1:40:45] like that. Once the world gets hold of
[1:40:48] of this, once there are people out there
[1:40:50] in the world who get hold of our videos
[1:40:52] and then you're going to see it start.
[1:40:54] They're going to start labeling me a
[1:40:56] brandomite, a cult. Uh you're going to
[1:40:59] see it's going to happen. So far, it's
[1:41:01] just been message believers disagreeing
[1:41:03] with me. But once it's it starts to get
[1:41:05] to the public, it's just going to be an
[1:41:07] onslaught. You're going to see that I'm
[1:41:11] not going to get anything out of this.
[1:41:12] I'm going to get more rejection, more uh
[1:41:16] uh uh and and I don't care. And it's not
[1:41:18] about me cuz I know they're rejecting
[1:41:20] God's word. They're rejecting the truth.
[1:41:23] But the message brings the wisdom of
[1:41:27] truth to mankind. You are not going to
[1:41:30] find truth like this anywhere else in
[1:41:33] the world. You are not going to find
[1:41:35] truth outside of the Bible and the
[1:41:36] message of the hour. The spirit of lies
[1:41:39] deforms the nature of man, but the
[1:41:42] spirit of truth builds him up again. The
[1:41:45] spirit of truth heals the nature of man.
[1:41:48] The spirit of truth sets you free, but
[1:41:50] the spirit of lies deforms you. The more
[1:41:53] you follow the internet, the more you
[1:41:55] follow Hollywood, the more you follow
[1:41:57] all the worldly stuff that comes out,
[1:41:59] the more multi-personality
[1:42:02] disorder it's going to produce, the more
[1:42:04] you are going to be somebody else to
[1:42:06] your parents, somebody else to your
[1:42:07] siblings, somebody else to your boss,
[1:42:09] somebody else to your friends, somebody
[1:42:11] else to your people at church. You are
[1:42:13] going to have all these people and then
[1:42:15] you look in the mirror one day and you
[1:42:17] don't know who to be. You don't know who
[1:42:19] to choose from. Who am I really from all
[1:42:22] these people that I portray? Whereas
[1:42:25] when you take his word, you eat the
[1:42:27] book, you become him. When you become
[1:42:31] him, that's an identity. That's one
[1:42:34] identity. That's one identity you want
[1:42:36] to be. That's one identity you can live
[1:42:38] by. That's one identity that gives you a
[1:42:40] happy marriage. your children who
[1:42:43] respect you. People who are real friends
[1:42:46] with you. A boss who can respect you as
[1:42:48] someone who tells the truth and you and
[1:42:50] doesn't want to manipulate you, doesn't
[1:42:52] need to manipulate you. Friends who know
[1:42:55] they can always count on you. People who
[1:42:57] know they can always come to you, who
[1:42:59] you will always tell the truth and you
[1:43:01] will not manipulate them. You become a
[1:43:04] savior of the world. You become someone
[1:43:06] who passes on the bomb and Gilead who
[1:43:09] who is salvation to other people. That
[1:43:11] is an identity that somebody can
[1:43:14] recognize he is different. She is
[1:43:16] different to the rest of the world.
[1:43:18] That's this when when you look at our
[1:43:21] government. This the easiest example I
[1:43:22] can give you. Our governments
[1:43:26] feed lies to the public. Look at what
[1:43:28] happens when our governments give us
[1:43:31] legislature laws and they come on
[1:43:33] television or the radio or wherever put
[1:43:37] out articles in the internet and the
[1:43:40] information that they send out deforms
[1:43:43] the public. What am I trying to show
[1:43:45] you? How the lies deforms the public.
[1:43:48] They literally have the public fighting
[1:43:51] each other over what they feed them.
[1:43:54] They give it to you through CNN, the
[1:43:56] news, BBC, all these people. They they
[1:43:59] feed this stuff through. Listen, they've
[1:44:01] got young people fighting about Israel
[1:44:04] in what does Israel care about who you
[1:44:07] are? What does Gaza care about who you
[1:44:10] are here in South Africa? They don't
[1:44:11] care. They don't care ABOUT YOU. THEY
[1:44:13] DON'T CARE ABOUT your life, your
[1:44:14] feelings, your money. Yet, they've got
[1:44:16] people here fighting about that. You're
[1:44:20] wasting precious minutes of your life
[1:44:22] fighting about people who don't care
[1:44:24] tuppence about you. You're getting
[1:44:26] involved in issues that they are feeding
[1:44:29] lies. They are transforming you into
[1:44:32] puppets that they can use and you are
[1:44:35] falling for it for everything. Whether
[1:44:37] it's about trans rights, abortion,
[1:44:41] whatever it is in this world, they are
[1:44:43] getting you involved in their fight.
[1:44:45] They are manipulating you. And look at
[1:44:46] what the public is becoming. Angrier,
[1:44:50] deceptive, manipulative, violent,
[1:44:53] looting, breaking down stuff, burning
[1:44:56] things down. They're developing this
[1:44:58] fighting mentality. It's the easiest
[1:45:01] example I can show you. In every country
[1:45:03] in the world, it's just this unrest and
[1:45:06] and a dissatisfied spirits in their
[1:45:09] lives. And these young people are losing
[1:45:12] the time to form meaningful
[1:45:14] relationships, to find the the love of
[1:45:17] their lives, their soulmates, to build
[1:45:20] homes, to and they got stuck in this
[1:45:23] thing. In every age of time, prophets
[1:45:27] and messengers were sent to criticize,
[1:45:30] to condemn the behavior of society, to
[1:45:33] criticize the governments, to call out
[1:45:35] the liars and point the truth to the
[1:45:37] people. Why? Why do you think a prophet
[1:45:40] is necessary to do this to put us back
[1:45:44] on the right track? He was sent to teach
[1:45:46] us these things. Do you seriously think
[1:45:48] they are here for rules to keep us in a
[1:45:52] message church? So whatever uh whatever
[1:45:56] does it is the best. Whoever does who
[1:45:58] keeps the rules is the best. Is is that
[1:46:01] what you think the message is? Uh that
[1:46:03] whoever keeps these rules will make it
[1:46:05] in the rapture and escape hell. That's
[1:46:08] the biggest lie spun by message people.
[1:46:12] That's not what this message is about,
[1:46:14] saints. It is salvation from the spirit
[1:46:17] of lies itself. The devil himself who
[1:46:21] has planted himself in every subtle area
[1:46:25] corner uh uh plane of your life from the
[1:46:30] time you were a little child. building
[1:46:32] you up to be something that is unstable,
[1:46:36] filled with anxiety, filled with
[1:46:38] depression. That's what the spirit wants
[1:46:40] to achieve in this world in this Satan's
[1:46:43] Eden. And God sends prophets.
[1:46:46] Prophets who are uneducated, who can't
[1:46:50] even save themselves from something,
[1:46:52] prophets who are who have inability. And
[1:46:54] he gives them ability and and smacks the
[1:46:57] lies in the public and cuts things down.
[1:47:00] and and people reject them. But that's
[1:47:03] why he sends us those prophets. They are
[1:47:06] the salvation of mankind. And the word
[1:47:09] they bring is nothing else but the truth
[1:47:12] and what God has has meant for us to
[1:47:14] receive in this day. Saints, don't fall
[1:47:17] for the enemy's trap. Don't fall for the
[1:47:20] lies of telling you who God is. This
[1:47:22] person far away in the galaxy or the
[1:47:25] devil under the ground waiting for you
[1:47:27] to come to hell. No, it's happening
[1:47:29] right now. Right now among you. Right
[1:47:33] now around you and within you, there are
[1:47:35] those two natures at war. If you don't
[1:47:38] realize by now why you need salvation,
[1:47:41] why you need the message, why you need
[1:47:43] this the word of God, why you need to be
[1:47:45] in church, why you need the Holy Ghost,
[1:47:48] why you need the word more and more
[1:47:50] every single day, then you've missed
[1:47:53] everything that the message actually is
[1:47:56] in truth.
