[0:01] Angels sing.
[0:04] &gt;&gt; Sons of God shout.
[0:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouted for joy.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; Again, those attributes in the beginning
[0:14] were not screaming.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; What is a shout? Amen. Let's read the
[0:19] rapture. Sunday school, listen up. Three
[0:22] things happen. A voice, a shout, a
[0:25] voice, a trumpet has to happen before
[0:28] Jesus appears. Now, a shout. Jesus does
[0:31] all three of them when he is descending.
[0:34] A shout. What is the shout? It's the
[0:37] message coming forth first. The living
[0:41] bread of life bringing forth the bride.
[0:45] &gt;&gt; There is the shout.
[0:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Sons of God shouted for joy.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this happens in his descent.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; This only comes down with the open book.
[0:57] &gt;&gt; Not before that.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; Before that, they still did not know the
[1:00] fellowship of the mystery. They still
[1:02] didn't have the shout.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; But the shout has come down with the
[1:06] second coming of the Lord.
[1:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08] &gt;&gt; Paul knew that it would be revealed.
[1:10] See, in attribute, if they shouted in
[1:13] manifested time, in manifested uh form,
[1:16] there has to be a shout again.
[1:19] Sons of God must shout for joy.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23] &gt;&gt; There is now silence in heaven, but
[1:25] there's a great shout on earth.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; People take these and make these
[1:30] literally about shouting with vocal
[1:32] cords.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; What vocal cords did the attributes have
[1:36] in heaven?
[1:39] &gt;&gt; The shout was a mystery because it was
[1:41] the hidden attribute form before the
[1:44] foundation of the world. It was in
[1:45] attribute form. It was not shouting with
[1:47] vocal cords the same way it was in
[1:49] singing with vocal cords.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; Singing was proclaiming a victory.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Shouting is what? If singing was
[1:59] overcoming for the angels, what is the
[2:02] shout for sons of God? There was no one
[2:05] to manifested before. It could only be
[2:08] manifested in the end time because the
[2:10] sons of God are revealed in the end
[2:12] time.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; Now it is manifest. A shout went out by
[2:17] a voice crying in the wilderness of
[2:19] Pentecost, "Come out of her, my people."
[2:23] &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of her sins,
[2:26] &gt;&gt; that was a shout that attracted us,
[2:29] &gt;&gt; right? And told us never to be a part of
[2:32] organized religion again.
[2:35] &gt;&gt; It's not talking about your Methodist
[2:36] church, you came from, your Catholic
[2:38] church, you came from, this church, and
[2:40] that. He's talking about organized
[2:41] religion. Yes.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; Come out of her, my people, and be not
[2:47] partakers of her sins and her
[2:48] abominations.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; The a shout crying in the wilderness of
[2:53] Pentecost called us in.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:55] &gt;&gt; Babylon is judged. It is fallen. And
[2:58] then comes the shout of the bride. You
[3:01] believe that?
[3:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to see this. I'm going to
[3:03] read this quote for you from why I am
[3:05] against organized religion. Notice the
[3:07] 19th chapter in is next.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; Everyone awake.
[3:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah,
[3:11] &gt;&gt; buckle your seat belts.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; After these things. That's that's the
[3:17] key there. After these things. After
[3:19] what things? He's reading Revelations
[3:21] 19. That means it's after Revelations 18
[3:25] and Revelation 17 and Revelation 16.
[3:29] Right? What is Revelation 16? The vials,
[3:31] whatever. Revelation 17, the revelation
[3:33] of the great that sits upon the
[3:34] beast with seven heads and 10 horns. In
[3:36] Revelations 18 is the destruction of
[3:39] that great and the beast. After
[3:42] these things,
[3:44] &gt;&gt; did you notice here in Revelations 19?
[3:46] After these things, watch. After what?
[3:51] After the message of come out of her.
[3:56] After that me, after the message of come
[3:59] out of her, watch is the shout of the
[4:02] bride saints with the bridegroom. Amen.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Going to the marriage of the lamb. How
[4:09] close are we then, brother? What's the
[4:11] last call? Come out of Babylon. What's
[4:13] the last call? Come out of Babylon. Come
[4:16] out of organized religion.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Don't come and form a message church and
[4:20] form an organized religion again.
[4:22] &gt;&gt; Come out of her. That's the reason
[4:24] message people are failing. You come out
[4:26] of one system into another system. You
[4:29] put in cold and formalism into the word.
[4:32] You put in radicalism into the word. You
[4:34] make another system. When you come out
[4:36] of a system and you bind people to a
[4:39] system, these are sons of God. They were
[4:42] not bound before the foundation of the
[4:43] world. They were free in him. They had a
[4:46] shout in them. If they shouted in
[4:48] attribute form, there must be a shout in
[4:50] this time. You will not hear a shout. If
[4:53] there's organized religion, because the
[4:55] first shout was, "Come out of her, my
[4:57] people." And after Babylon is destroyed,
[5:00] that is the shout of the bride saints
[5:02] with the bridegroom. Amen.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; This is now.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You want to read
[5:07] Revelation 19:1-7 with me? This is the
[5:10] shout that comes after the shout of come
[5:13] out of her.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you ready?
[5:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:20] &gt;&gt; Ah, looks like I went back to that.
[5:23] Revelations 19 1-7. We'll start 1 to 3.
[5:27] After these things, after what things?
[5:31] destruction of organized religion. I
[5:33] don't want you to ever say that is the
[5:36] Catholic Church and the Vatican and the
[5:40] Methodist and the Baptist and all that
[5:42] because you people make up organized
[5:44] religion.
[5:46] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about the organized religion
[5:49] you made up by your free will
[5:52] &gt;&gt; to trap yourself and other people into
[5:55] come out of her.
[5:57] You will only see the fellowship of the
[6:00] mystery manifested in you. You will only
[6:02] have this shout when you come out of
[6:05] that thing.
[6:06] &gt;&gt; Stop blaming denominational people or a
[6:09] previous religion you came from or some
[6:11] other kind of thing. You have to come
[6:13] out of that that needs to be destroyed.
[6:16] &gt;&gt; And there is the shout. Hallelujah.
[6:19] Salvation and glory and all the symbols.
[6:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[6:22] &gt;&gt; there's a reality to this. And honor and
[6:25] power unto the Lord our God. Here it is.
[6:28] For true and righteous are his
[6:30] judgments. For he hath judged the great
[6:33] which did corrupt the earth with
[6:36] her fornication and had avenged the
[6:38] blood of his servants at her hand.
[6:43] And again they said hallelujah. And her
[6:46] smoke rose up forever and ever. This is
[6:49] the shout. The first part of the shout
[6:51] is what? The rejoicing. The
[6:54] manifestation that in you is judged the
[6:59] great
[7:02] &gt;&gt; The fellowship of the mystery, the
[7:04] strength of the attribute in you is to
[7:06] break up organized religion.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; It is the mark of the beast.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; You cannot stand it.
[7:13] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[7:14] &gt;&gt; you cannot stay in it. You cannot make a
[7:16] new message denomination.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; This attribute will not do that.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. It will not cluster together
[7:23] because that organized religion spirit
[7:27] is not of the same purpose.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; It cannot speak for God. It cannot stand
[7:33] in this world. It will join itself with
[7:35] fallen angels.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; The first part of the shout is what is
[7:40] that? What is it? It's the revelation
[7:42] the seals.
[7:44] &gt;&gt; What is the exposing and the judgment of
[7:46] the great war which should corrupt the
[7:48] earth with the fornication? That is the
[7:49] exposing the seals. When you break off
[7:52] the religious spirit and the political
[7:54] spirit and the demonic spirit and the
[7:55] paleos rider and the fifth seal and the
[7:57] sixth seal, you are exposing organized
[8:00] religion, you are laying it flat on its
[8:02] back. You are slaughtering it and
[8:04] dissecting it into pieces. It tells you
[8:06] what each spirit is. It tells you
[8:08] religious spirit is a poser, is an
[8:11] impostor. It's religion. It's your
[8:13] prayer life. It's your reading your
[8:15] message books. It's listening to your
[8:16] tapes. It's all the new system you
[8:18] created. It's a white horse rider acting
[8:22] like you're righteous but no faith
[8:24] inside.
[8:25] &gt;&gt; No standing for truth.
[8:28] Glory to God.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; That's the first part of the shout. And
[8:31] the 4 and 20 elders when the 4 and20
[8:34] elders see that that's the old and new
[8:36] testament. When they see that breaking
[8:38] of organized religion in you, it bows
[8:41] down.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And all the New Testament gives up
[8:45] all the types and shadows and reveals
[8:47] everything that you have confessed that
[8:50] you have done. God that sat on the
[8:52] throne saying, "Amen. Hallelujah. Praise
[8:54] be to God." And a voice came out of the
[8:56] throne saying, "Praise our God, all ye
[9:00] servants, and you that fear him both
[9:02] small and great. And I heard as it were
[9:04] the voice of a great multitude, there it
[9:07] is. Shout, and the voice of many waters,
[9:10] and as the voice of mighty thunderings
[9:13] sing, hallelujah, for the Lord God
[9:16] omnipotence reignth. Here it is. Let us
[9:19] be glad and rejoice and give honor to
[9:23] him, for the marriage of the lamb is
[9:25] come and his wife had made herself
[9:27] ready.
[9:28] &gt;&gt; What? So the first part of the shout is
[9:31] the exposing of organized religion, the
[9:33] exposing of the enemy. The second part
[9:35] is they shouted for
[9:38] &gt;&gt; joy. Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[9:43] honor to him because what is happening?
[9:46] The second part of the shout is uniting
[9:49] with the word,
[9:51] &gt;&gt; the bridegroom. So you break away from
[9:53] the old system and you come in a perfect
[9:56] union with a revealed word of the hour.
[9:59] That is connecting with sons of God.
[10:01] That is connecting with theophony. That
[10:04] is not religion. There's nothing anyone
[10:06] can reveal to you about that. Nobody's
[10:08] going to show that to you personally.
[10:10] That is something can only happen when
[10:12] you break away completely from every
[10:15] form of system religions. Amen.
[10:19] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "This is the shout of
[10:21] the bride and the bridegroom that comes
[10:23] after that."
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[10:27] &gt;&gt; Come out of her was the prophet's
[10:29] ministry.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; After that
[10:35] is the shout of the bride saints and the
[10:37] bridegroom.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; Revelations 19 1-9.
[10:43] We read 1:7.
[10:45] We are the attributes that shouted in
[10:47] the beginning from the foundation of the
[10:48] world. We are the part of the cluster
[10:51] that is called bride and bridegroom
[10:53] because we once shouted in third form
[10:56] when we are manifested on earth. We will
[11:00] find one another.
[11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:02] &gt;&gt; We will be drawn together because there
[11:04] is now a shout in us.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; The shout has come in his descent. He's
[11:10] brought that book down. There is a
[11:12] shout. That shout revealed the enemy,
[11:14] exposed false religion and and
[11:17] introduced us to our bridegroom. That
[11:19] shout is in us. We live for that.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; We correct ourselves for that every
[11:24] single day.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; Every single day, we feel that
[11:27] conviction inside. I shouldn't do this.
[11:30] I shouldn't do this. This isn't right.
[11:32] Nobody else lives like that.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Nobody else has the fellowship of the
[11:38] mystery. Those people out there don't
[11:39] even care what happens in their lives.
[11:41] They can drink a beer, wine, whatever
[11:44] without even any conscience problems.
[11:46] They can fornicate. They can do drugs.
[11:48] They can smoke. They can swear. They can
[11:50] curse. They can do everything they want
[11:51] to do. No problem.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Not you.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; You will torment yourself
[11:58] &gt;&gt; because there is a shout.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; There's something drawing you together.
[12:03] There's a cluster of attributes that are
[12:06] manifested in this day that are
[12:07] connected with a theophony because sons
[12:10] of God are being revealed in this time.
[12:13] What is the shout in us? Praise be to
[12:16] God. If you take that where it says
[12:18] praise be to our God. Let's put it in
[12:21] our language.
[12:23] When it says um let us be glad and
[12:26] rejoice or the previous one, right? We
[12:30] acknowledge the revealing of the seals
[12:32] that has exposed the defeating the
[12:35] defeated enemy.
[12:37] I'm just telling you what it says in our
[12:39] language. You have now rightfully judged
[12:42] where it says you are the righteous and
[12:43] true judge. You have rightfully and true
[12:46] truly judged the immoral spirit of
[12:49] organized religion which corrupted all
[12:52] of human nature. Did you see that?
[12:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; That for true and righteous are your
[12:57] judgments. He had judged the great war
[12:59] which did corrupt the earth with her
[13:01] fornication.
[13:03] Right? There's the first part. We
[13:05] acknowledge your judgment. That means
[13:07] Lord, I believe the revelation of the
[13:11] seven seals
[13:13] completely.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; With all my soul cuz I know it
[13:17] completely judges immoral organized
[13:22] religion.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; I will never be a part of that.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Right? You have set right what has been
[13:27] done wrong against and it says which had
[13:30] avenged the blood of his servants at her
[13:33] hand.
[13:35] Organized religion has murdered
[13:38] children of God.
[13:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[13:41] &gt;&gt; Not just in real life but also robbed
[13:44] them of happiness.
[13:46] Rob them of things they could have
[13:48] throughout the ages.
[13:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal being open has judged
[13:53] her. It's over.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; And lastly,
[14:01] that last point, let us be glad and
[14:03] rejoice. I challenge any one of you.
[14:06] Don't do it now. Could take out those
[14:08] wonderful phone of yours and Google the
[14:12] meaning of the word rapture.
[14:16] How many think you know what rapture
[14:17] means? Anybody?
[14:20] &gt;&gt; Yes. Not the drug.
[14:26] Joy.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; That's the real meaning of rapture.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Extreme joy.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Intense joy
[14:40] that gathers your spirit up into an
[14:43] elated state. That is English.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what rapture actually.
[14:49] Imagine all this time we're going on
[14:52] about rapture being transfiguration,
[14:54] translation, and making doctrines about
[14:56] it. Talk about bodies and all of that.
[14:59] Rapture is extreme joy.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; Extreme joy, intense joy that elates
[15:05] your spirit and makes you rise to a
[15:07] higher dimension.
[15:09] &gt;&gt; That is what existed in the beginning in
[15:12] those attributes that were hidden in
[15:13] him. That was hidden. That cannot be
[15:17] known if you are still stuck in
[15:18] organized religion. Why do you hunger
[15:21] thirst? Why do you fail? Why does the
[15:23] heavenly father is trying to reveal all
[15:25] these mystery secrets to you, but you'll
[15:27] let so many things get these things out
[15:29] of you? This is what the world is trying
[15:31] to do. He's trying to create another
[15:33] Eden for you. Is that right? It's what
[15:35] we spoke about last week. He cannot
[15:37] touch the word. The seven seal has laid
[15:38] it flat. The the seals being open has
[15:41] opened up everything to us. You you
[15:43] cannot give us organized religion again.
[15:46] You cannot force feed that to us. It's
[15:48] not going to happen. The only last thing
[15:50] this enemy has is to produce another
[15:53] Eden.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; A better Eden,
[15:56] &gt;&gt; a nicer life, a better distraction from
[16:00] what? From coming together.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; From the fellowship of the mystery,
[16:05] dividing the brotherhood. That's the
[16:07] last play the enemy has, right? What
[16:09] does the loss play at the at the at the
[16:11] supper table before Christ was
[16:13] crucified?
[16:15] Who should be the one who would
[16:18] betray you?
[16:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, tell us. Is it he? Is it him?
[16:25] &gt;&gt; And he says to them,
[16:29] Peter, feed my sheep.
[16:33] Keep the brotherhood.
[16:35] &gt;&gt; That's your strength.
[16:37] Stay united, stay one.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; What is the enemy going to do?
[16:43] &gt;&gt; He will produce a better Eden for you, a
[16:46] better idea, a better uh form of life, a
[16:50] better way to serve God, a better way to
[16:52] produce the bride, a better way to come
[16:54] to the capstone, a another way to bring
[16:57] forth sons of God, another idea,
[17:01] breaking up the brother. That that's
[17:03] what's happening right now. We are
[17:04] sniping at each other. ministers sniping
[17:06] at each other from pulpits.
[17:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Bringing each other down. Why would you
[17:11] do that?
[17:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[17:14] &gt;&gt; For us, it means the uniting together of
[17:17] manifested attributes of this day that
[17:20] express the purpose of God that was kept
[17:22] secret through time but revealed in the
[17:25] last days. Verse 8 says, "And to her,"
[17:29] that's not there. That is after the
[17:31] shot. And to her, are you ready? was
[17:35] granted that she should be arrayed in
[17:38] fine linen, clean and white. For the
[17:42] fine linen is the righteousness of
[17:44] saints.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; What is the fine linen you are waiting
[17:48] to be clothed in? Clean and white, which
[17:51] is the righteousness of saints for the
[17:54] rapture.
[17:57] Where is that cloth coming from?
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[18:03] &gt;&gt; That is your theophony.
[18:05] &gt;&gt; That is the sons of God.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; That is the fullness. That is the the
[18:09] the fullness of adoption. That's what
[18:11] you have been predestinated unto. To her
[18:14] was granted that she should receive her
[18:18] theophony. That the bride would be
[18:20] clothed in the theophony she long
[18:22] awaited for. That is the completion of
[18:26] sons. Morning stars sang and sons of God
[18:30] shouted for joy.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; Angels overcame fallen angels. But sons
[18:36] of God manifest the fellowship of the
[18:38] mystery that was hidden God before the
[18:41] foundation of the world. And that is the
[18:43] fellowship of the mystery
[18:47] &gt;&gt; is God becoming man and man becoming
[18:50] God.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; God became man in Jesus Christ. You
[18:55] become theophony which is king
[18:57] theophony.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; God becoming man, man becoming God.
[19:02] There is the mystery. It is only
[19:04] manifested in manifested signs.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads
[19:09] together. Amen.
