[0:00] Greetings dear brothers and sisters in
[0:02] the wonderful name of our Lord and
[0:03] Savior Jesus Christ. Trust that you are
[0:06] all well and happy in the word and in
[0:10] the presence of almighty God every
[0:13] single day and I trust that the word has
[0:16] been a blessing to you. So, we are
[0:20] getting into the throne of God part
[0:22] three. That's our subject. And the
[0:25] tabernacle of Moses part two,
[0:28] the most holy place part one. We're
[0:31] going to begin with uh begin the study
[0:34] on the most holy place. And for a title,
[0:37] there I will meet with you.
[0:41] For a scripture reading, we begin from
[0:43] Exodus 25
[0:45] and verse 21-22.
[0:48] And the word of God reads like this. And
[0:51] thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon
[0:54] the ark, and in the ark, thou shalt put
[0:57] the testimony that I shall give thee.
[0:59] Testimony is the law. Verse 22. And
[1:03] there I will meet with thee, and I will
[1:07] commune with thee from above the mercy
[1:09] seat, from between the two cherubams,
[1:11] which are upon the ark of the testimony
[1:14] of all things which I will give thee in
[1:16] commandment unto the children of Israel.
[1:20] So before we begin, let us recall that
[1:25] it took the people's most precious
[1:27] belongings and greatest of sacrifice to
[1:31] build this tabernacle. So it was
[1:33] something that they treasured and kept
[1:36] with honor and holiness.
[1:39] And because it was sanctified by God
[1:42] unto himself, they were able to keep it
[1:47] uh with honor.
[1:49] So we will study all the entire design
[1:52] of the tabernacle.
[1:54] But today we want to particularly see
[1:57] the importance of the holiest of holies
[2:01] or as it is also called the most holy
[2:05] place.
[2:06] So to begin I want us to examine the
[2:09] layout of this tabernacle again.
[2:13] And
[2:14] um we're probably going to do this
[2:16] several times, but what I want to do is
[2:20] um show you with finest detail
[2:26] uh what this really is about. And we're
[2:29] going to go through it uh really with a
[2:32] lot of inspection,
[2:35] looking at the smallest
[2:37] uh things that people might think as
[2:39] insignificant.
[2:41] And uh then we're going to relate it to
[2:43] ourselves and hopefully as we come to
[2:48] the close of the series, we're going to
[2:50] see a lot more with regards to a much
[2:53] broader picture.
[2:56] So I've I've put a diagram in the notes
[2:58] for us to take a look at. And uh if you
[3:03] have it on your phones or tablets or
[3:06] you've downloaded it or if you can uh
[3:10] print a picture of it and uh or I'll see
[3:14] if I can maybe post a picture of it on
[3:16] the WhatsApp group
[3:18] so that you can follow with it. So, if
[3:21] you'll notice,
[3:23] um, we've done it before, but if you'll
[3:26] notice in this diagram, we've got a
[3:29] rectangle. Uh, and of course, that's the
[3:32] largest rectangle is the outer court.
[3:35] And in there, you can see um, looking at
[3:38] the bottom of the diagram, we've got the
[3:41] gate. Then, we've got the square brazen
[3:43] altar, and the circle is the brazen
[3:47] labor. got all the um the labels of this
[3:52] diagram. And then towards the top of the
[3:56] outer court, you can see there
[3:59] um
[4:02] uh another building
[4:05] within that outer court and it's another
[4:07] rectangular building and within that are
[4:11] two rooms. Okay. So, we've got the inner
[4:14] court, which is the larger room and the
[4:16] most holy place or the holiest of
[4:18] holies, is the smaller room. So, in the
[4:22] in the um inner court, you can see the
[4:25] table of shoebre, the seven golden
[4:27] candlesticks, the altar of incense,
[4:31] and in the most holy place, of course,
[4:33] the ark of the covenant.
[4:36] Now, this is a very simple geometric
[4:40] diagram.
[4:42] and not detailed like showing you the
[4:45] pictures of the manora or the seven
[4:48] golden candlesticks and no without those
[4:51] details because today we're going to
[4:53] focus on uh a separate set of details.
[4:57] So one of them is and you can see to the
[5:00] top right of the diagram I've got the
[5:03] the cardinal points of direction.
[5:06] So you'll notice that
[5:10] the um of course your diagram is is uh
[5:15] rectangular vertically.
[5:18] So you'll you'll see that
[5:20] that the most holy place is on the west
[5:25] part
[5:27] of the of the uh tabernacle. The
[5:30] entrance or the gate to the tabernacle
[5:33] is on the east.
[5:36] The seven gold golden candlesticks is on
[5:39] the south and the table of shoebread is
[5:41] on the north. So these are important
[5:44] things to notice.
[5:47] Right? So at the outset I want to say
[5:49] that there are so many things beautiful
[5:52] things that we will pick up on while
[5:54] going through the setting of the
[5:57] tabernacle. Obviously we cannot go
[5:59] through every detail in this teaching.
[6:04] Um but we will pick up everything later.
[6:07] All the finer details we will surely
[6:10] pick it up later. Now I want to start
[6:12] with explaining a few things and we're
[6:15] going to start with the outer court.
[6:19] Now this part this outer court was also
[6:23] called the court of the congregation.
[6:26] Why? because this is the place that the
[6:29] congregation or the people were allowed
[6:32] to enter. Okay? They could come through
[6:34] that gate and uh they could come in uh
[6:38] to the brazen altar. They could meet
[6:41] with the priests there but they were not
[6:43] allowed into the inner court. Okay? So
[6:47] the outer court was also called the
[6:49] court of the congregation.
[6:52] Now we will look at this in finer detail
[6:54] in another segment but for now a few
[6:56] significant things.
[6:58] So this outer court important attributes
[7:02] here that you must take notice of. Now
[7:04] I'm not going to preach on this because
[7:07] I want to focus on the most holy place
[7:10] to towards the middle and end of this uh
[7:14] teaching. But I want you to remember
[7:16] these um important details that we're
[7:20] mentioning now.
[7:23] The outer court was a large empty open
[7:26] space. So if you look at that large
[7:29] rectangle
[7:31] border of the outer court, there was no
[7:35] roof to this. It was just like a fence
[7:40] made of poles and skin,
[7:44] but there was no roof. In other words,
[7:46] the outer court is open to atmosphere.
[7:50] There's no roof or covering. It's open
[7:52] to atmosphere which means the outer
[7:55] court is affected by the climactic
[7:58] conditions. In other words, sun, wind,
[8:02] rain, cold,
[8:05] etc. Right? These are important
[8:08] attributes.
[8:10] Now, I believe if God wanted to have a
[8:13] roof, he would have told Moses to build
[8:16] a roof. Right?
[8:19] Now there were just two major pieces of
[8:22] furniture in this court. That is the
[8:25] brazen altar or the altar of brass and
[8:29] the brazen labor or the labor of brass.
[8:32] These are the different names that you
[8:34] may hear in the Bible. Now in this court
[8:38] the believer was allowed to bring his
[8:41] sacrifice to the priest which would then
[8:45] be offered on the brazen altar. Here the
[8:49] people and the priesthood they could
[8:51] pass freely yet the priests maintained
[8:55] an an a high order of respect and
[9:00] holiness.
[9:02] So it's important to note that there was
[9:05] there could be a high amount of traffic
[9:06] here in this court. In other words, the
[9:10] the priesthood could make contact with
[9:14] the outside. The priest could make
[9:16] contact with other people,
[9:19] right? But still there was meant to be a
[9:22] high order of respect and holiness.
[9:26] So let's read the scripture here. Exodus
[9:28] 26 30-35.
[9:31] This is the tabernacle of the
[9:33] congregation. And thou shalt rear up the
[9:36] tabernacle according to the fashion
[9:38] thereof which was showed thee in the
[9:40] mount. Thou shalt make a veil of blue
[9:43] and purple and scarlet and fine wine
[9:46] linen of cunning work with cherubams
[9:48] shall it be made. And thou shalt hang it
[9:51] upon four pillars of chitim wood
[9:54] overlaid with gold. Their hooks shall be
[9:57] of gold upon the four sockets of silver.
[10:00] And thou shalt hang up the veil under
[10:02] the tashes that thou mayest bring in
[10:04] thither within the veil the ark of the
[10:07] testimony. And the veil shall divide
[10:09] unto you between the holy place and the
[10:12] most holy place. And thou shalt put the
[10:14] mercy seat upon the ark of the testimony
[10:18] in the most holy place. And thou shalt
[10:20] set the table without the veil, and the
[10:24] candlestick over against the table on
[10:26] the side of the tabernacle toward the
[10:29] south. And thou shalt put the table on
[10:32] the north side. So the actual tabernacle
[10:36] was the structure
[10:38] within the outer court. All right? So
[10:41] looking at your diagrams,
[10:44] the outer court was just a fenced off
[10:47] area
[10:49] without a roof. The actual building was
[10:54] this
[10:55] uh rectangular
[10:58] structure that was built up and it was
[11:02] divided into two rooms by a thick veil
[11:05] of fine twine linen.
[11:08] And the first room was called the inner
[11:11] court or the holy place. And the second
[11:15] or innermost room was called the most
[11:18] holy place in the Bible or the holy of
[11:22] holies by the Hebrews.
[11:25] So let's look at that inner court. Now
[11:28] let's study that a little bit. So this
[11:32] rectangular court which we call the
[11:35] inner court had one entrance. Notice
[11:38] that. Okay. So now notice the the
[11:42] directions that I've given you there.
[11:46] Um the rect this this inner cord had one
[11:49] entrance and that entrance
[11:52] was on the east side and that was both
[11:55] an entrance and an exit. Right? So it
[11:58] was an entrance from the outer court
[12:01] into the inner court and it was an exit
[12:05] from the inner court into the outer
[12:07] court. Right? So
[12:11] um this inner court had an entrance from
[12:16] the east side from the outer court into
[12:19] the inner court and then it had an
[12:21] entrance on the west side which took you
[12:25] into the most holy place.
[12:28] This inner court was furnished with
[12:30] three things.
[12:32] It had the seven golden candlesticks on
[12:35] the south side
[12:38] and the table of showbread on the north
[12:40] side and the altar of incense was on the
[12:45] west side just before the veil.
[12:50] Now this room, this inner court room was
[12:54] lit by the light of the candlesticks.
[12:57] There were no windows to let light in.
[13:01] Right? So no no no light coming in from
[13:04] the outside. The light on the inside of
[13:07] the inner court was from the seven
[13:10] golden candlesticks. All very important
[13:14] attributes. Okay. [clears throat]
[13:17] Only the priests and the prophet Moses
[13:21] were allowed in here.
[13:24] Right now, even in this court,
[13:29] man was free to walk around yet always
[13:32] in the highest order of holiness and
[13:36] respect. So there would be the high
[13:40] priest, other priests,
[13:42] and they could walk around in here and
[13:45] they could be free, but they were to
[13:48] keep the highest order of holiness,
[13:52] right?
[13:54] Now this brings us to the most holy
[13:57] place.
[13:58] This room was four square
[14:03] that had only the mercy seat, the ark of
[14:06] the covenant or the ark of the
[14:08] testimony. And later on it had the
[14:11] golden pot in which was the manner that
[14:14] never corrupted. And lastly, even later,
[14:20] it had the rod of Aaron that budded.
[14:24] This room, the most holy place, had only
[14:27] one entrance and exit, and it was at the
[14:32] east side of this little room.
[14:35] This room had no artificial light. It
[14:38] remained in darkness if the pillar of
[14:42] fire was not there. So you'll notice the
[14:45] outer court had light from the sun. It
[14:48] had light from the elements, light from
[14:51] the earth, light from the fires. Um the
[14:55] inner court had light only from the
[14:57] seven golden candlesticks.
[15:00] And the most holy place was the darkest
[15:03] place,
[15:04] right? It had no artificial light. It
[15:07] had no flame by a candle or a or a
[15:10] candlestick or something like that. So
[15:13] the outer cord has light from the
[15:15] elements, light from the from the
[15:17] planet, from the outside. The inner cord
[15:20] has light from the candlesticks. But the
[15:23] light of the most holy place could only
[15:25] be shakina glory.
[15:29] In other words, the pillar of fire.
[15:32] No man could enter into this most holy
[15:35] place except the high priest who would
[15:38] enter in once a year for the atonement.
[15:42] And the only other person allowed to
[15:44] enter in here was the prophet Moses.
[15:48] No one, no priest, no high priest was
[15:51] allowed to just walk in there anytime he
[15:55] felt like. Right. So I want to get to
[15:59] something very important and about this
[16:03] most holy place and we're going to look
[16:04] at six phrases in the verse
[16:10] of uh in a verse of Exodus 25:22
[16:14] and we're going to look at six phrases
[16:16] there and uh this is going to set a good
[16:21] stage for what we are going to speak on
[16:23] about this most holy place in the other
[16:25] two uh sessions. that we will be coming
[16:28] to.
[16:30] Before we do that, I want you to take
[16:31] notice of the little things in here. You
[16:35] can actually see the two comingings of
[16:37] Christ in the construction of the
[16:39] tabernacle.
[16:42] You can see that the first coming is
[16:44] typed in the east part of the tabernacle
[16:47] and that's where the altar of sacrifices
[16:50] typing where Jesus was crucified.
[16:53] And on the west side of the tabernacle
[16:55] is where the tabernacle is completed.
[16:58] So if you were walking, you you will
[17:02] come in from the east side, pass through
[17:05] the sacrifice, the first coming of the
[17:08] sacrifice, and you will complete that
[17:10] walk in the west. So here we see the
[17:13] second coming symbolized by a most holy
[17:16] room which God meets the believer in.
[17:21] Amen. It's amazing.
[17:25] So, we notice this beautiful expression
[17:28] in just noticing which is east and west
[17:31] of this tabernacle.
[17:35] So, let's get to Exodus 25:22.
[17:38] And this is what it says.
[17:41] And as I read this, I'm going to point
[17:43] out the six um phrases that we are going
[17:47] to study.
[17:49] The first phrase, and I will meet with
[17:53] thee. And that's our title. There I will
[17:56] meet with thee. And there I will meet
[17:58] with thee. Number two, and I will
[18:01] commune with thee. Number three, from
[18:04] above the mercy seat. Number four, from
[18:08] between the two cherubams,
[18:12] which are number five, upon the ark of
[18:15] the testimony
[18:17] of all things which number six, I will
[18:21] give thee in commandment.
[18:25] I will give thee in commandment unto the
[18:27] children of Israel. Amen. So, we're
[18:31] going to look at these phrases there. I
[18:33] will meet with thee. I will commune with
[18:35] thee from above the mercy seat from
[18:38] between the two cherubams upon the ark
[18:41] of the testimony
[18:43] I will give thee in commandment.
[18:46] So from the studying or from studying
[18:49] the layout we can see that if there was
[18:51] a place to be identified as the throne
[18:54] of God in Moses day it would have to be
[18:56] the most holy place. Judging by the
[18:59] characteristics of things and of men, we
[19:04] can easily not misplace or mistake God's
[19:07] place of rulership. It has to be the
[19:10] most holy place. You wouldn't say the
[19:13] throne of God. Of course, this entire
[19:15] thing um uh is the plan of the throne of
[19:19] God. But you wouldn't u say that the
[19:22] place where God is would be in the outer
[19:26] court or even in the inner court. Right?
[19:29] You would have to acknowledge that the
[19:32] throne itself is in that most holy
[19:36] place. Right?
[19:39] In that time, that was the place of the
[19:41] throne of God, the place of God's
[19:43] rulership. Then if this was the pattern
[19:47] of things that God showed to Moses,
[19:50] was this the pattern God was setting or
[19:53] was there something else that this was
[19:55] made after?
[19:58] Now I don't believe that we could think
[20:00] carnally that there is a place in heaven
[20:04] after which pattern Moses built the
[20:06] tabernacle. Right? I've said this to you
[20:09] before. I believe it's the character of
[20:12] things we need to be watching.
[20:15] Right? So last week I I I mentioned I
[20:19] don't believe that God showed Moses this
[20:21] picture of things in in in in the
[20:23] heavens and then he decided by himself
[20:27] or you know by some understanding that
[20:30] he must build this tabernacle based on a
[20:32] picture right he was shown some kind of
[20:36] vision and he had the gift to interpret
[20:38] that vision and God allowed him to
[20:41] interpret it and then gave him
[20:43] instructions on how to design the
[20:45] vision. very things right so in not too
[20:49] much detail let's look at what
[20:52] characteristics God considers to be the
[20:55] most holy place so that's what we have
[20:58] to study here is the character of things
[21:01] that's what we need to watch okay so
[21:04] looking at the character the
[21:06] characteristics of the things that God
[21:09] considers to be the most holy place from
[21:12] which he said he would speak. He said he
[21:16] would speak from that most holy place
[21:18] and from there would be the place he
[21:20] would give revelation of his word. So to
[21:24] start off with we start with the main
[21:26] phrase there I will meet with thee.
[21:31] Now firstly
[21:33] uh this was an absolutely amazing uh
[21:36] revelation. I I had never seen this
[21:39] before when I preached um
[21:43] uh this series some time ago. I think it
[21:45] was 2014 or something. I had never seen
[21:48] this before and I I was quite amazed
[21:51] that I never took notice of this. So in
[21:54] the Bible, the word meet that is me e
[22:00] means to keep an appointment that was
[22:02] previously set up. Okay? when you say
[22:05] someone. So if you talk about meeting
[22:08] someone uh in life we meet people by
[22:12] accident or coincidence as we would say
[22:16] sometimes. So it's like you go into a
[22:19] shopping mall and you and you see
[22:21] someone. So what you would describe as
[22:24] meeting someone means not just seeing
[22:27] someone but basically bumping into them
[22:30] uh recognizing one another and
[22:34] exchanging words, greetings
[22:37] and you would call that meeting someone.
[22:40] Okay. But
[22:43] um that's that's a coincidental meeting.
[22:48] But if a meeting is planned main the
[22:52] main meaning of meeting is an
[22:55] appointment that was previous previously
[22:57] set up in other words you you planned
[23:00] beforehand
[23:01] to meet right and that's how it works
[23:04] with with people when you say I have a
[23:06] meeting with someone you obviously have
[23:10] had preparations you've discussed
[23:12] something and both parties have agreed
[23:15] to come together on something that's
[23:17] what a meeting is. So if he says there I
[23:20] will meet with thee,
[23:23] uh he's not going to wait randomly for
[23:25] Moses to pitch up at this tabernacle
[23:28] once in a while and that's when when he
[23:30] sees Moses there then he will come down.
[23:32] No, he will tell Moses, I'm going to
[23:36] meet with you. Meet me at such and such
[23:38] a time on such and such a date. In other
[23:42] words, it was previously set up. Right?
[23:44] So this shows that God's meetings are
[23:48] not random. They're not haphazard.
[23:51] They're not coincidental.
[23:53] They are not casual happenings.
[23:56] Moses, though he had privileges, he
[23:59] could not just saunter into the most
[24:01] holy place and make himself at home and
[24:03] then call on God. An appointment had to
[24:07] be made by God. Now symbolically that
[24:12] indicates the fornowledge of God. How
[24:15] that God knows what revelation is needed
[24:18] at what time and that he's always on
[24:21] time
[24:23] or schedule to give to Moses or whoever
[24:26] it is um what he's supposed to give them
[24:30] for that day. So by fornowledge an
[24:34] appointment was made right. It means
[24:36] that this is an occurrence that takes
[24:39] place by appointment. A meeting is an
[24:42] occurrence that takes place by
[24:44] appointment. It's not random. It's not
[24:46] by perhaps. It's not coincidental like
[24:49] you meeting someone at the mall.
[24:52] But saints, there is a far greater
[24:55] meaning to this.
[24:57] All right? So consider the word meet.
[25:01] There I will meet with thee. Consider
[25:03] the word meat in this scripture. This is
[25:06] astounding.
[25:08] Now, in the Hebrew lexicon, so for those
[25:11] of you who have the table on uh the
[25:14] table program of the message in the
[25:16] Bible on your computer, so if you open
[25:19] up your table and you go to the
[25:22] scripture, Exodus 25:22,
[25:25] and you come to the scripture where it
[25:26] says, "There, I will meet with thee."
[25:29] And if you click on that word meat, it's
[25:31] going to bring you into the Hebrew word
[25:35] or if you have a Strongs concordance,
[25:38] you go to Strong's concordance number
[25:40] 3259
[25:42] and you'll find the Hebrew word used
[25:46] where you find the English word meat.
[25:49] Right? So, the original Hebrew word is
[25:53] spelled Y Apostrophe
[25:58] A D or pronounced Yah.
[26:02] Okay. And the meaning there
[26:05] is okay. So, there's a few meanings to
[26:08] this word, right? Meet there. I will
[26:11] meet with thee. The meanings are to fix,
[26:16] appoint, to assemble, to meet, to set.
[26:21] So far, we're doing fine. We expected
[26:24] that. But the last and most important
[26:27] meaning there is betro or marry.
[26:33] Okay. So the word meet our modernday
[26:36] English
[26:38] is not meant here in the Bible. This is
[26:40] not coincidental meeting. It's not just
[26:44] about, you know, when we think of meet,
[26:46] we think of two people coming together
[26:48] to sit and discuss something.
[26:51] That's not entirely wrong because Moses
[26:54] could come into the holiest of holies
[26:59] uh
[27:01] and uh uh to hear from God, right?
[27:05] Um, so it didn't seem wrong to say that
[27:10] two people coming together to sit and
[27:12] discuss something could mean meet. But
[27:15] that's how we commonly uh interpret it
[27:19] today. But this word meet has such a
[27:22] great meaning and such greater meaning
[27:25] and reveals so much more to us. The
[27:28] original word in the Hebrew is yahad. Ya
[27:32] ya pronounced ya yad that's probably the
[27:36] pron the correct pronunciation it is
[27:38] used in several scriptures right in um
[27:42] that that particular word for meat is
[27:45] used in several scriptures in the Bible
[27:48] and it's first used as the word
[27:51] betrothed in the book of Exodus
[27:54] it means married right in other words
[27:59] um of course Before I get to that, its
[28:03] first use of that word yahad to mean
[28:07] married. It is then used thereafter in
[28:10] other places for the word gather or
[28:14] assemble or appoint or meet as we've
[28:18] seen in this particular verse. Then
[28:21] there is one other place that this word
[28:23] yard is used.
[28:26] the same word in another astounding way
[28:29] that adds another dimension to this
[28:32] revelation for us and it is Amos 3:3
[28:36] and that is the it is used for the word
[28:39] agreed.
[28:41] Amos 3:3 says can two walk together
[28:45] except they be agreed.
[28:48] Right?
[28:49] So if we if we stick out the other word,
[28:52] stick the other word in. Can two people
[28:54] walk together except they they meet?
[28:59] Okay, let's stick all the words in. Can
[29:01] two people walk together except they be
[29:03] betrothed?
[29:06] Right? So I'm going to put this to put
[29:09] all this together. So the Lord said,
[29:12] "There I will meet with you."
[29:16] Right? So there I will meet with you
[29:19] means there we will be betrod
[29:23] or there we will be agreed or in a
[29:26] better sense there I will become one
[29:31] with you this is amazing because there
[29:34] is so much in there right in Abs 3:3 it
[29:38] is can two walk together except they be
[29:42] agreed
[29:44] say it another way can two walk together
[29:47] if they cannot meet?
[29:50] Can two walk together if they cannot
[29:53] become one? What does a scripture
[29:56] actually mean? Here's the reality of
[29:58] Amos 3:3. Can two people share the same
[30:03] purpose if they cannot be of one mind or
[30:07] one nature? That's what it means. Can
[30:10] two walk together except they be agreed?
[30:12] What's the deeper meaning behind the
[30:13] scripture? Can two people share the same
[30:16] purpose if they cannot be of one mind or
[30:19] one nature?
[30:22] So saints, the holiest of holies is the
[30:25] only place designated by God where his
[30:29] name and nature can become one with
[30:33] man's name and nature. And when there is
[30:38] a union of nature or mind,
[30:42] then there is a union of purpose.
[30:46] See, so when he says there I will meet
[30:49] with thee, he's saying there I will
[30:52] become one with you at a time appointed,
[30:58] appointed before the foundation of the
[31:00] world. Not a random time. A time I've
[31:03] seen, a time I've chosen. That's when I
[31:06] will become one with you. And this only
[31:10] takes place in that holiest of holies,
[31:13] the most holy place.
[31:15] Praise be to God. That's wonderful,
[31:18] saints. There's so much that could be
[31:19] said of this, so much more that could be
[31:23] said. So I I believe that when um
[31:29] you know just by finding out what these
[31:31] things mean, these words mean for
[31:34] example the word meat is such an
[31:37] incredible revelation because it brings
[31:39] a greater dimension to what the
[31:41] scripture actually is trying to tell us.
[31:44] Right there I will meet with thee. All
[31:48] right, which brings us to the second
[31:50] phrase. Now this next phrase indicates
[31:55] what kind of relationship occurs after a
[31:58] meeting.
[32:01] What kind of relationship occurs after a
[32:03] marriage
[32:05] or a union of natures
[32:08] uh or of the mind a union of the mind of
[32:12] two minds.
[32:14] This tells us what kind of relationship
[32:16] occurs after that has taken place. So
[32:20] let's bring this together.
[32:23] Commune means to converse. Converse
[32:27] means to talk
[32:29] or communicate.
[32:32] So commune means
[32:34] to share thoughts. Okay? So there I will
[32:39] meet with thee. That's the starting
[32:41] point. There I will become one with
[32:43] thee.
[32:45] Right? And there I will commune with
[32:48] thee. In other words, there we will
[32:51] share thoughts.
[32:53] So this indicates that God didn't just
[32:56] call Moses to give him instructions.
[33:00] He also called him so that he could hear
[33:02] what Moses's thoughts were.
[33:06] This is amazing.
[33:08] God had them design this place where he
[33:12] could become one with the prophet and
[33:15] where the people's case could be
[33:18] presented before God and God could
[33:21] present his case before Moses and there
[33:24] could be a meeting of the minds. There
[33:27] could be a union of nature.
[33:30] Right? Now, here's a question I want to
[33:32] ask. Is there such a place in heaven
[33:35] where God will consider the thoughts of
[33:37] man? If you believe in the
[33:43] nominal Christian Pentecostal
[33:46] denominational idea of heaven in the
[33:49] universe,
[33:51] where is that place of access that that
[33:55] you can go to in the universe where you
[33:59] can commune with God?
[34:01] Now we know from places in the Bible
[34:04] that God hearkened to the voice of
[34:06] Moses. That means he heard what Moses
[34:09] has to say. And there's some places
[34:11] where it says and the Lord repented
[34:13] himself. Which means the Lord changed
[34:16] his mind based on what Moses said.
[34:20] So when we ask about hearing the
[34:24] thoughts of men, we know it cannot
[34:27] happen in a physical place, right?
[34:31] The most holy place in the tabernacle of
[34:34] Moses was a spectacle, a physical place
[34:38] that the people could see Moses go into
[34:41] when he went
[34:44] uh from the outer court into the inner
[34:46] inner court and past the veil into the
[34:49] most holy place. The people knew that
[34:51] Moses was in the most holy place. It was
[34:55] a spectacle. It was a physical place
[34:56] that the people could see him go into.
[34:59] And this would solidify the importance
[35:01] of Moses' ministry. In other words, it
[35:03] vindicated Moses. It made Mo Moses
[35:06] ministry
[35:08] uh feel more significant to the people.
[35:12] So we know that God does not need right
[35:16] the truth is he doesn't need a physical
[35:18] room a physical place or some room in
[35:22] your house some specific room in your
[35:25] house where you have to kneel down
[35:27] before a Bible or a cross. God doesn't
[35:30] need a physical place that you can find
[35:34] where he can commune with your thoughts
[35:36] where he can know your thoughts and you
[35:39] can hear it.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[35:40] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work that way, right? Uh
[35:45] this was a the place built to solidify
[35:49] the importance of Moses ministry to the
[35:52] people.
[35:53] We know that God does not need a
[35:55] physical place to commune with the
[35:56] thoughts of man. We know he already
[35:59] knows our thoughts
[36:01] before we even say something to him. He
[36:05] already hears one's thought.
[36:09] However, he will not commune with men
[36:14] except under specific conditions.
[36:17] Now, well, clearly things have to be in
[36:19] a certain order for this to be even
[36:22] possible. So, this brings us to the next
[36:25] point above the mercy seat. So, for it
[36:29] to be possible that God would commune
[36:31] with man, there first has to be a mercy
[36:34] seat. Okay? So look at the look at the
[36:38] process we're going through. I will meet
[36:40] with thee. That means I will become one
[36:44] with you. Then I will commune with thee.
[36:47] That means I will share thoughts. We
[36:50] will share thoughts. I will share mine.
[36:52] You will share your thoughts. Right?
[36:56] But these are the conditions now above
[36:59] the mercy seat. So for it to be possible
[37:03] that God would commune with man, there
[37:06] first has to be a mercy seat in place.
[37:10] What is that? What is a mercy seat?
[37:13] Right now, if you go again into your
[37:15] Hebrew lexicon to have a look at what
[37:18] that means, mercy seat, the Hebrew word
[37:22] is capore.
[37:24] Mercy seat or place of atonement.
[37:27] It's the place of atonement. Okay. the
[37:30] golden plate of propitiation on which
[37:33] the high priest sprinkled the seed seven
[37:35] times on the day of atonement
[37:37] symbolically reconciling Jehovah and his
[37:40] chosen people. The slab of gold. These
[37:43] are the descriptions in the Hebrew
[37:45] lexicon. The slab of gold on top of the
[37:47] ark of the covenant which measured two
[37:50] by 2.5x 1.5 cubits. on it and part of it
[37:55] were the two golden cherubam
[37:58] facing each other whose outstretched
[38:00] wings came together above and
[38:02] constituted the throne of God. All
[38:05] right. So it is a place that mercy seat
[38:08] is a place that upon which there must be
[38:12] something that brings atonement.
[38:15] Okay, that's what that mercy seat is. In
[38:19] this case, it is the blood of atonement.
[38:24] Okay. So, how about in heaven? If people
[38:26] say God's throne is in heaven in the
[38:29] universe, now we know that in heaven
[38:32] there is no flesh and blood. So, what is
[38:35] the mercy seat in heaven?
[38:39] Come on, saints. What is the mercy seat
[38:41] in heaven? What is the blood of
[38:43] atonement a type of in heaven?
[38:48] There was no literal mercy seat in
[38:50] heaven needing blood before Christ. So
[38:54] where did it suddenly come from when
[38:57] Christ was crucified?
[39:00] Right? So what I'm asking you is if if
[39:03] Moses saw the pattern of things in the
[39:06] heavens, why would God in heaven need an
[39:09] altar of sacrifice when nothing was
[39:12] sacrificed physically in heaven in the
[39:15] seventh and sixth dimension? There is no
[39:17] killing in heaven. I certainly hope that
[39:20] the seventh and sixth dimensions cannot
[39:22] have shed blood. Otherwise, what's the
[39:25] point of going there for the rapture?
[39:28] You can't kill theophony in heaven.
[39:31] There's no animals running around for
[39:32] you to cut up and shed blood. So why
[39:35] would God need a seat in heaven, a mercy
[39:39] seat in heaven that requires blood?
[39:42] Blood was uh what was required for an
[39:46] atonement.
[39:48] So what offerings would be accepted in a
[39:51] sixthdimensional place where there is no
[39:54] killing or shedding of blood?
[39:57] So we realize then that this mercy seat
[40:00] in heaven is just a symbol of something,
[40:06] right? So before Christ, what was this
[40:10] throne functioning as?
[40:14] As long as there is no blood upon the
[40:16] mercy seat,
[40:18] it is a judgment seat.
[40:22] Amen. That's what we got to understand.
[40:24] As long as there is no blood of
[40:26] atonement, it is a judgment seat. Let's
[40:29] read from Revelations chapter 5. That is
[40:31] the message Revelation chapter 5
[40:33] preached in 1961
[40:35] paragraph 64. Brother Baron says, "And
[40:38] we found them in the Old Testament with
[40:40] the ark. We find them in the New
[40:42] Testament. And then we find them over in
[40:44] the coming of the Lord again. cherubims
[40:48] guarding the mercy seat. The mercy seat
[40:51] would which no one could approach unless
[40:54] there was an atonement there for that
[40:57] person.
[40:59] Only way that the sanctuary when it was
[41:02] sprinkled of the blood then it became a
[41:05] mercy seat. I want to read that again.
[41:09] only way
[41:11] that the sanctuary when it was sprinkled
[41:14] with a sprinkle of the blood then it
[41:17] became a mercy seat. In other words,
[41:19] what brother Ben Baram is saying is the
[41:21] only time it becomes a mercy seat is
[41:23] when there is blood present on it. But
[41:26] after the blood was taken off, then it
[41:29] became a judgment seat.
[41:32] Amen. So therefore we can say that
[41:35] before the blood of Christ was shed it
[41:37] was a judgment seat. When the blood was
[41:40] applied it became a mercy seat and a
[41:44] place of meeting. There could be no
[41:46] meeting if there's no blood.
[41:49] But if the blood is taken off again it
[41:53] goes back to being a judgment seat.
[41:57] Why is this important? So therefore,
[42:00] when the blood is applied,
[42:02] listen carefully saints, it is the only
[42:05] season that is possible for there to be
[42:09] a baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[42:14] Right? There can only be a baptism of
[42:17] the Holy Ghost when there is blood on
[42:19] the mercy seat. When there is blood on
[42:22] the on the seat, then it becomes a mercy
[42:24] seat. Then there can be baptism of the
[42:26] Holy Ghost upon man. And there can only
[42:30] be the existence of a bride church. Why?
[42:34] Because if there's no blood on the mercy
[42:36] seat, there can be no union. There can
[42:40] be no marriage. It's simple to
[42:42] understand. If it's a judgment seat,
[42:44] there can be no meeting.
[42:47] Right? How can there be of one mind? How
[42:50] can there be a union of minds, a union
[42:52] of nature if there is no blood?
[42:56] So there the reason for a mercy seat
[42:59] there the reason for a mercy seat is so
[43:01] that blood can be applied and that makes
[43:03] it possible for communion it makes it
[43:06] possible for meeting
[43:08] right if there's no blood there's no
[43:12] meeting there's no marriage there's no
[43:14] communication there's no appointments
[43:17] there's no revelations
[43:20] so what's important is that wherever the
[43:24] throne of God is if the judgment seat
[43:27] does not have something to transform it
[43:30] into a mercy seat then there is no
[43:34] communion appointments or revelations.
[43:38] Why is this important for you to
[43:40] understand my brother my sister?
[43:46] This in a few words means
[43:49] right
[43:52] that we need to gravely and soberly
[43:55] realize
[43:57] what it means to have a soul without an
[44:01] atonement. So obviously what am I
[44:04] saying? If you know if we are to be the
[44:07] throne of God in the last day,
[44:10] what is the atonement in our soul that
[44:14] changes our being from having a seat of
[44:18] judgment
[44:20] changed to a seat of mercy
[44:23] thereby restoring communication and
[44:26] revelation.
[44:28] So I'm going to say this simply without
[44:32] what's in my notes.
[44:35] Okay.
[44:39] Um,
[44:41] you believed that you knew God for so
[44:45] long.
[44:46] You believe that you heard from God for
[44:48] so long. You believe that you understood
[44:51] God for so long.
[44:53] But the scriptures themselves tell us
[44:55] that you were alien to God. You were
[44:59] alienated in your own mind. That's
[45:01] that's what Colossians says. You were
[45:03] alienated in your own mind from him
[45:06] because you did not understand the
[45:08] things of God. Right? Now just think
[45:11] about this. You actually thought that
[45:15] when you prayed to God, he was talking
[45:17] to you. You were talking to him.
[45:21] In the meantime,
[45:24] if there was no atonement in your own
[45:27] soul,
[45:28] you were basically bluffing yourself.
[45:33] And a lot of people in this world
[45:36] experience that. It's an intellectual
[45:39] conception. It's a feeling. It's an
[45:41] emotion.
[45:44] But when you have that blood of
[45:46] atonement in your soul
[45:50] right now, how can there be blood in the
[45:52] soul? Obviously, this is symbolic. In
[45:55] other words, if you really have a
[45:57] revelation of Calvary, if you really
[45:59] have a revelation of who Christ is to
[46:02] you, if that blood of sacrifice means
[46:05] more to you than life itself,
[46:08] if you've had a serious experience of
[46:11] salvation, saints,
[46:14] then you have that blood on the mercy
[46:17] seat in your soul. And that's what gives
[46:21] you the ability to have a meeting with
[46:24] God.
[46:26] There I will meet with thee. That's
[46:28] where you have the ability to have the
[46:31] marriage of the two natures in your
[46:33] soul. And that gives you communion.
[46:38] Praise be to God. Which then leads to
[46:41] revelation.
[46:43] Again, that is something we will get to,
[46:47] right? We will get to that
[46:48] communication, that revelation. We will
[46:51] get to that mercy seat. We're going to
[46:53] be talking about that, right? We're
[46:55] going to study that mercy seat in man
[46:58] [clears throat] in a different segment.
[47:01] Now, this brings me to the fourth uh
[47:04] phrase between the cherubams.
[47:08] Okay, so cherubams in the Bible are
[47:12] guardian angels. They're gods. They
[47:15] symbolize a guardian anointing. You
[47:19] remember uh lion, ox, man, eagle. They
[47:23] were anointings of the Holy Ghost and
[47:27] they were gods.
[47:29] Now,
[47:30] what are they? Some kind of ferocious
[47:32] creatures that if something comes close
[47:35] to them, they run off and bite
[47:37] something.
[47:39] Okay, so let's not be ridiculous, okay?
[47:42] What are these really? They are
[47:43] anointings of the Holy Ghost. Now, how
[47:46] does anointing protect anything? And
[47:48] what is it protecting?
[47:51] Remember, we spoke about this in the
[47:52] seals.
[47:55] Uh why does God need protecting?
[47:58] I mean, he's God. He doesn't need
[48:01] protecting from anything.
[48:03] So, what's the point of having guardian
[48:05] angels?
[48:07] Okay. So it actually shows you contrary
[48:10] to the thinking of man.
[48:14] This is not protecting God. This is
[48:16] protecting the outside
[48:18] from the inside. See now
[48:23] there's only one thing they are also
[48:26] protecting on the inside and we're going
[48:29] to talk about that now. They protect the
[48:32] mercy seat and whatever it and whatever
[48:35] is upon it. How? So let's think about
[48:38] this symbolically.
[48:40] They protect not by fighting but by
[48:44] covering. You can see that in the design
[48:46] of the cherubams on the mercy seat. What
[48:49] were they doing? They had outstretched
[48:51] wings covering the seat.
[48:54] Their duty is covering the mercy seat.
[48:58] So the full view,
[49:02] excuse [clears throat] me, the full view
[49:04] is blocked.
[49:06] What does that mean? The revelation is
[49:09] blocked.
[49:10] Okay, this means if one really wants to
[49:14] know what is on the mercy seat, one has
[49:17] to see what the cherubams see
[49:21] or simply have the same anointing. Do
[49:25] you get it? See, you can't be uh you
[49:29] can't be uh a viewer
[49:34] or try to get around the Germans to see
[49:36] what is on the seat itself
[49:40] to have that
[49:43] because the wing is covering. You have
[49:45] to have the eyes of the cherubams
[49:47] because only the eyes of the cherubams
[49:49] are going to see what is on that seat.
[49:51] Nothing else can see the complete mercy
[49:54] seat.
[49:57] What does this mean? Cherubams therefore
[50:00] represent anointing
[50:03] produced by revelation, not the other
[50:05] way around. Anointing doesn't produce
[50:09] revelation. Revelation produces
[50:12] anointing. Right? So in this case,
[50:15] [clears throat] revelation produces the
[50:16] right anointing to protect the throne
[50:19] from corruption.
[50:22] That's what the cherubs are there for.
[50:24] So in other words, there's so many
[50:26] things that God places here in I there I
[50:28] will meet with you. I will commune with
[50:31] you, but I'm not going to commune
[50:33] anywhere else. I'm not going to meet
[50:35] anywhere else. I'll meet with you in the
[50:38] most holy place. Now in the most holy
[50:41] place, I will commune with you
[50:45] on the mercy seat from between the
[50:47] cherubams. So there are conditions. So
[50:50] even in your soul, I am going to commune
[50:54] with you in your soul. So I'll meet with
[50:56] you in your soul. But I'll commune with
[50:59] you on condition that there is an ark
[51:02] with a mercy seat on it and there's
[51:05] cherubams and I'll commune with you from
[51:08] between the the two cherubams which is
[51:11] upon the ark and we'll get to that just
[51:13] now.
[51:15] Right? So what are the cherubams
[51:17] representing? anointing
[51:20] produced by revelation.
[51:24] Beautiful.
[51:28] Upon the ark of the testimony. That's
[51:30] point number five. So notice the mercy
[51:32] seat and the ark are two different
[51:35] pieces alto together. Right? The ark is
[51:37] just a box or a carrier or
[51:40] [clears throat] a cradle that houses
[51:42] something or keeps something safe from
[51:44] the outside. In this case, the ark was
[51:48] the protector of the law. And what is
[51:51] the law? The law is the nature of God
[51:54] revealed to man, the written word. Okay?
[51:58] So this means that somewhere in our
[52:01] soul, we must have an ark
[52:05] where the written word can find a place
[52:07] to be anchored or rested and take root.
[52:13] It is only upon this ark that the mercy
[52:17] seat will fit because it is made of the
[52:20] exact dimensions of the ark. The mercy
[52:23] seat would not fit on any other box, not
[52:27] any other ark.
[52:32] It's designed for the ark. So, can you
[52:35] see that the mercy seat and the ark are
[52:37] two different pieces?
[52:39] But the mercy seat is designed for this
[52:42] for this ark. So this configuration in
[52:45] your soul God is telling you
[52:48] communication will be
[52:52] effective.
[52:54] Sharing of thoughts will only take place
[52:58] if there is an ark
[53:01] where the written word has taken root,
[53:04] where it finds rest, where the written
[53:06] word is anchored and upon that there
[53:09] must be this mercy seat. It must have a
[53:14] representation of atonement on it.
[53:17] And furthermore, it must have anointing
[53:23] which comes from the revelation of that
[53:25] atonement.
[53:27] Amen.
[53:30] Point number six, which is our last
[53:32] point,
[53:33] I will give thee commandment.
[53:36] So above receiving revelation of who God
[53:39] is saints and so much more he says he
[53:43] will give us commandment or instruction.
[53:48] This place is the control tower of man.
[53:51] Most men have their brain as a control
[53:54] tower. They think that their that their
[53:55] control tower is their brain. But we
[53:57] know that that place is so easily
[54:00] corrupted by the enemy. The brain of man
[54:02] is so easily corrupted.
[54:05] The spirit of God gives the believer a
[54:07] commandment from the most holy place.
[54:11] What is a commandment? Law. What is law?
[54:15] The correct leading, the correct
[54:17] instinct of what to say and what to do
[54:21] to be truly righteous. Commandment then
[54:24] translates to the application
[54:27] of the revelation. So it's fine. Your
[54:30] soul receives revelation deep within.
[54:33] Revelation is given. You say amen to
[54:36] that. But then from that soul realm
[54:40] comes instruction,
[54:43] commandment. Your spirit perceives
[54:47] through that revelation,
[54:49] instruction
[54:50] to know what to do in everyday life by
[54:54] the nature of God. And saints, that's
[54:57] what every true believer desires for his
[54:59] life. That's where I believe we feel our
[55:02] purpose becoming real. Amen. I believe
[55:06] however that the main thing a believer
[55:08] has to come to terms with is that we
[55:10] cannot meet God anywhere else today but
[55:14] in the place that he has provided.
[55:17] There I will meet with thee saints. In
[55:20] closing, I want to put it to you this
[55:22] way.
[55:26] And I'm stepping ahead. so far ahead.
[55:30] People make the mistake. People's lives
[55:34] with God are all upside down because
[55:38] they feel they can meet him in the outer
[55:40] court.
[55:43] They feel that they can that their
[55:45] natures become one with God because they
[55:49] do things on the outside because they
[55:51] keep the standards because they dress
[55:53] right or they dress in a certain way
[55:55] because they give to charities because
[55:58] they pray every day because they read
[56:00] the Bible. Those things are out of court
[56:03] things.
[56:05] That's not where he meets. That's not
[56:07] where you become one with his nature.
[56:09] That's not where the marriage takes
[56:11] place. That's not where the communion
[56:13] takes place. They can there's no
[56:15] atonement there
[56:18] uh taken in where there is no
[56:20] corruption.
[56:23] Right?
[56:25] Some people think it's the spirit, it's
[56:27] the mind, it's the inner cord. It's
[56:30] where you can some people think in your
[56:32] spirit is where you you you feel the
[56:34] emotions where you um
[56:39] you have your understanding of the
[56:41] scriptures or the way you can study the
[56:44] word or uh you know the the spirit realm
[56:48] of man seems to be the most important
[56:50] thing to him. He thinks his mind is more
[56:53] important. How he can explain things,
[56:56] how he can explain doctrines, how he can
[56:58] teach doctrines, how he can preach
[56:59] doctrines, how he can express things to
[57:02] other people. But even that is not where
[57:04] the marriage can be.
[57:07] That's not the most holy place. That
[57:09] second court is not the place where he
[57:12] meets. There's no communion there.
[57:14] There's no marriage there. There's no
[57:17] atonement there. There's no mercy seat
[57:20] there.
[57:22] There is no anointing
[57:25] created by revelation there
[57:28] saints. God has provided a place where
[57:31] he said there I will meet with thee.
[57:36] That is the holiest of holies. That is
[57:38] the most holy place. There is no
[57:41] artificial light herein. This is where
[57:44] shakina glory itself comes down.
[57:48] The meeting takes place in that shakina
[57:51] presence.
[57:53] Amen.
[57:54] That's where I will become one with you.
[57:57] That is where you and I will be agreed.
[58:00] That is where your purpose and my
[58:02] purpose come together in a union. That
[58:05] is where I will commune with you. You
[58:08] will commune with me. That's where I
[58:10] will share my thoughts. That's where you
[58:12] will share your thoughts. That's where
[58:14] our purposes will combine. And from
[58:17] there I will give you
[58:20] commandment.
[58:21] I will teach you how to take the
[58:24] revelation
[58:27] and and break it down into instruction
[58:30] to tell you what to do on the outside,
[58:33] what your outer cord can do, what your
[58:35] inner court can do. But I will meet with
[58:39] you in the holiest, the most holy place,
[58:43] the holiest of holies.
[58:47] Amen.
[58:48] May the Lord bless you. We will get more
[58:51] into this in the next few sessions, but
[58:53] I trust that you would understand and
[58:56] take some of the things that we spoke
[58:57] on. Saints, if there's some of you that
[59:01] have been living by intellectual
[59:03] conception,
[59:05] if God is not speaking to you from his
[59:07] word, I believe that every one of us are
[59:10] uh or have reached a place where when we
[59:13] read the word, God is speaking to us.
[59:16] God is revealing things to us.
[59:19] And if that is happening with you when
[59:22] you read the Bible, when you read the
[59:23] message, when you are going beyond just
[59:26] carnal understandings and intellectual
[59:29] conceptions, when you are going beyond
[59:31] that and God is revealing things to you,
[59:34] then something has taken place inside
[59:36] the soul. There's been a resurrection.
[59:39] Shakina glory has landed. Shakina glory
[59:41] has filled the room.
[59:44] Amen. And you receiving from the most
[59:47] high himself.
[59:50] There I will meet with thee.
