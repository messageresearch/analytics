[0:01] God bless you brothers and sisters in
[0:03] the wonderful name of our Lord and
[0:04] Savior Jesus Christ. Great to be sharing
[0:07] the word of the Lord with you once again
[0:09] and um we're getting into this beautiful
[0:11] subject on the throne of God part seven
[0:15] and we're getting into the inner court
[0:18] part one.
[0:21] Uh, and the first thing we're going to
[0:22] look at in the inner court is the table
[0:24] of showbread. Spelled S H E W Shu
[0:30] bread, but it's pronounced showbread.
[0:32] The table of showbread. And for a title,
[0:37] bread of the presence. Bread of the
[0:40] presence. Now, let's begin with our
[0:43] scripture reading from Hebrews 9:1-4.
[0:46] We've read the scripture before.
[0:49] uh Hebrews 9:1-4 this is Paul speaking
[0:53] then verily the first covenant and had
[0:57] also ordinances of divine service and a
[0:59] worldly sanctuary for there was a
[1:02] tabernacle made the first wherein was
[1:05] the candlestick and the table and the
[1:08] showbread
[1:10] which is called the sanctuary.
[1:13] So that's saying the first um the the
[1:17] first tabernacle made was that inner
[1:20] court the first wherein was the
[1:22] candlestick the table and the showbread
[1:25] which is called the sanctuary. So that
[1:26] area in a veil uh that uh inner court is
[1:30] called the sanctuary. And after the
[1:32] second veil, the tabernacle, verse
[1:34] three, after the second veil,
[1:36] tabernacle, which is called the holiest
[1:38] of all, which had the golden sensor and
[1:41] the ark of the covenant, overlaid round
[1:43] about with gold, wherein was the golden
[1:46] pot that had mana, and Aaron's rod that
[1:49] budded and the tables of the covenant.
[1:53] So we're going to take one more
[1:55] scripture 2 Chronicles 13
[1:58] 11 and this is speaking of Solomon's
[2:01] temple which is patented after this one.
[2:06] Verse 11 says and they burn unto the
[2:09] Lord every morning and every evening
[2:12] burnt sacrifices and sweet incense. the
[2:15] showbread also set there in order upon
[2:19] the pure table and the candlestick of
[2:23] gold with the lamps thereof to burn
[2:25] every evening for we keep the charge of
[2:28] the Lord our God but you have forsaken
[2:32] him all right so that's 2 Chronicles 13
[2:37] 11
[2:39] the first scripture Hebrews 9:1-4
[2:42] shows us the differentiation between the
[2:45] most holy place and the tabernacle of
[2:48] the congregation or the inner court as
[2:52] it's very commonly referred to as. It
[2:56] also gives us a clear indication of the
[2:59] furniture in the inner court. In other
[3:02] words, some of the items that are
[3:04] inside, but it it speaks specifically of
[3:07] the candlestick
[3:09] and the table and the showbread. All
[3:12] right. There is one thing that it
[3:14] doesn't speak of there which is the
[3:15] altar of incense but we'll pick that up
[3:19] a lot later
[3:22] uh in a different segment. Now we want
[3:24] to speak particularly on the table of
[3:27] showbread. We've just finished about
[3:31] four sessions on the most holy place and
[3:35] we looked at specifically
[3:38] things that concern the most holy place.
[3:41] the furniture that is inside, the
[3:44] conditions surrounding it, the
[3:46] functioning of it, and um towards the
[3:50] end of the series, we're going to bring
[3:51] all of these things together and um sort
[3:55] of summarize them in a way that's going
[3:57] to make these things a lot more personal
[3:59] to us. So, I trust that the Holy Spirit
[4:01] would give you some kind of uh heading
[4:05] as to where we're going with all this.
[4:08] So the table of showbread let's go to
[4:10] Exodus 25 23-30
[4:14] and uh let's have a look at how this uh
[4:18] table is constructed and the things
[4:20] surrounding what it's made and we'll
[4:23] look at some of the laws surrounding it.
[4:25] But um it's so beautiful when we see
[4:31] um how the so types in with the true
[4:35] tabernacle of God, the throne of God and
[4:37] so on. Uh there's some beautiful
[4:39] beautiful types in there and that's what
[4:41] I'd like to share with you in the
[4:43] session. So Exodus 25
[4:46] 23-30.
[4:48] Thou shalt also make a table of chitim
[4:51] wood. Two cubits shall be the length
[4:54] thereof, and a cubit the breadth
[4:56] thereof, and a cubit and a half the
[4:59] height thereof, and thou shalt overlay
[5:01] it with pure gold, and make thereto a
[5:05] crown of gold roundout.
[5:08] And thou shalt make unto it a border of
[5:11] enhand breath roundout, and thou shalt
[5:14] make a golden crown to the border
[5:16] thereof roundout. Verse 26. And thou
[5:20] shalt make for it four rings of gold,
[5:22] and put the rings in the four corners
[5:25] that are on the four feet thereof. Over
[5:28] against the border shall the rings be
[5:31] for places of the staves to bear the
[5:33] table. And thou shalt make the staves of
[5:36] shitim wood, and overlay them with gold,
[5:39] and the table may be born with them. And
[5:43] thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and
[5:45] spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and
[5:48] the bowls thereof, to cover with all, of
[5:52] pure gold shalt thou make them. And thou
[5:56] shalt set upon the table showbread
[5:59] before me always.
[6:04] Amen. Now notice, just like the ark,
[6:08] this table is made of the same simple
[6:11] common acacia wood and overlaid with
[6:14] pure gold. So not
[6:18] laboring the subject, but you'll
[6:21] remember from before
[6:24] acia wood is like common humanity and
[6:28] gold is a is a type of deity, symbolic
[6:31] of deity. So it's like humanity covered
[6:34] with deity. In other words, literally
[6:37] making
[6:39] the the flesh become word. The flesh
[6:43] become God.
[6:45] So notice also like all foursided
[6:49] furniture, the crown of gold or an
[6:53] elevated edge
[6:56] created around the perimeter of the top
[6:59] just like the ark. crown of gold draws a
[7:02] focus to the head and what is contained
[7:07] on or in it. So if you and I made a
[7:10] table, we take a flat piece of board and
[7:14] then attach four legs to it at the
[7:16] corners. So what God instructed was
[7:21] make that flat piece of board, attach
[7:25] the four legs, but then on top of that
[7:28] board make another layer which he called
[7:32] the crown. And that would be the actual
[7:35] table upon which
[7:38] um everything would be placed. That
[7:40] crown would be an extra piece that
[7:43] fitted on top of the of the table and it
[7:47] had kind of like um uh a pieces that
[7:52] were overlapping or sticking out. So, it
[7:54] wasn't just a flat piece of board
[7:56] matching the dimensions of the legs and
[7:59] so on. It was a very decorative piece
[8:03] that fitted on top of the table. So in
[8:06] other words, it it it was as if you had
[8:08] like a like a like another mercy seat
[8:11] sitting on top of uh a table of exactly
[8:14] the same dimensions. I hope you can
[8:16] understand that. So notice all the extra
[8:21] fixings, everything, the
[8:25] the the the dishes, the bowls, the
[8:27] spoons,
[8:29] uh the rings, they were all made of pure
[8:31] gold, right? and upon the table within
[8:35] the crown of gold. So on the inside of
[8:39] this this uh other crown that sat upon
[8:43] this table was the showbread.
[8:47] Okay. Now that phrase
[8:51] showbread before me always this can be
[8:55] written as showbread continually. In
[8:59] other words, you will set before me on
[9:02] the table showbread continually. In
[9:05] other words, you will always have
[9:08] showbread before me. That in other
[9:10] words, that table must always have
[9:12] showbread on it at all times. So, if you
[9:16] were going to come in and remove the old
[9:18] showbread, you had to have new showbread
[9:20] to replace it. That's basically what the
[9:23] priest had to do.
[9:26] So we shall soon understand the meaning
[9:28] and purpose of the showbread in the
[9:31] inner court. That's our purpose for this
[9:34] session and that's what we hope to
[9:35] achieve. So the purpose of the table was
[9:38] just to hold the showbread and to draw
[9:41] attention. The whole the crown on top of
[9:45] that table
[9:47] uh made someone focus on the showbread.
[9:51] If you had to look at it, it draws
[9:53] attention to the showbread.
[9:57] This shows that the showbread was
[9:59] actually of greater importance than the
[10:02] table itself. But we want to talk about
[10:05] the table first and then we'll get to
[10:07] the showbread. So [clears throat]
[10:10] the pure table, I want to call it that
[10:13] because that's what Solomon said in 2
[10:17] Chronicles 13:11.
[10:20] He said the showbread set they in order
[10:23] upon the pure table. Now table doesn't
[10:27] seem to have much significance to us
[10:29] today except a table to us is something
[10:32] to eat at or write at or to decorate
[10:36] with ornaments you know like a desk or
[10:39] something. In the old days table had a
[10:42] much greater significance. Let's take
[10:45] Psalm 23 and verse 5. How often have we
[10:50] read the psalm, recited the psalm,
[10:52] prayed, sang this particular verse,
[10:56] verse 5, thou preparest a table before
[10:59] me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou
[11:02] anointest my head with oil, my cup runth
[11:05] over.
[11:07] In this statement, you can see the table
[11:10] being used with the word presence.
[11:12] Again, remember our subject is the bread
[11:15] of the presence.
[11:17] Now a table being prepared
[11:22] in the old times means an opportunity is
[11:27] being made to talk or to fellowship
[11:29] intimately or face to face. In other
[11:33] words, a table represented
[11:36] a close face-toface conversation
[11:40] and yet with comfortable distance in
[11:43] between.
[11:44] But think about how important this is.
[11:46] This is not in my notes, but I'm just
[11:48] saying in the old days, you're looking
[11:50] at in the days when there were no uh
[11:53] fancy developments, fancy homes,
[11:56] and you live in a hut. Why would you
[11:59] have
[12:01] uh a a table that takes up space? You
[12:04] know, in the old the old days, huts,
[12:07] people would sit at the floor because
[12:09] you need space in a small little
[12:10] building. Why would you stick a big
[12:12] table in there? So tables were were
[12:16] things that were kept in places like
[12:18] eating houses
[12:21] uh well not restaurants. There were no
[12:23] restaurants in those very uh ancient
[12:25] times. But so table represented
[12:31] uh a a time of conversation,
[12:35] face-to-face conversation. And yet what
[12:38] the table did was it created a
[12:41] comfortable distance in between the
[12:43] people that were having a conversation.
[12:46] So people in those days also generally
[12:50] didn't choose to sit at a table.
[12:54] If you study history, uh even the rich
[12:57] people
[12:58] would eat while
[13:01] lying on a couch or some kind of seating
[13:05] uh um very comfortable seating area and
[13:08] trays of food would be placed next to
[13:10] them. So it wasn't as much about eating
[13:13] as it was about negotiations and uh
[13:18] discussing something or having
[13:20] conversations. That's what table
[13:23] represents. So in the above scripture,
[13:26] David is saying that God presents an
[13:28] opportunity for him to sit at
[13:31] negotiations with his enemies face to
[13:35] face. And what's beautiful about this is
[13:38] God creates the opportunity for David to
[13:41] be sitting face to face with his enemies
[13:45] having discussions. And that's where God
[13:47] chooses to anoint his head with oil.
[13:50] meaning proves David's election
[13:54] in public in the midst of those
[13:56] negotiations and also shows off the
[13:59] blessing upon David. That's what my cup
[14:02] runth over means.
[14:05] See, my cup runth over means showing the
[14:07] blessing upon David and showing that he
[14:10] doesn't have need of anything. So it's
[14:13] so important because when you when
[14:15] you're having negotiations with your
[14:18] enemies, usually negotiations are well,
[14:21] you tell me what you want and I'll tell
[14:23] you what I want and we'll see where we
[14:25] can compromise. But if you come like
[14:28] David to a negotiation, his cup runth
[14:30] over, there's nothing you have that he
[14:33] wants. And uh God shows clearly by the
[14:38] anointing that's with him that his head
[14:40] is anointed with oil. And this brings
[14:44] negotiations to a place that it's in
[14:46] favor for David. So that's what David is
[14:49] saying here. Preparing a table before me
[14:52] in the presence of my enemies is giving
[14:55] me an opportunity
[14:57] to
[14:59] uh have a conversation with my enemies
[15:02] where
[15:04] who God is to me and what he has done
[15:07] with me can be made known to them. Amen.
[15:11] It's so beautiful. Every verse of that
[15:12] psalm is so rich with revelation. It's
[15:15] incredible. But anyway, so why would
[15:18] there be a table of showbread?
[15:23] It is an opportunity
[15:26] presented to come into a face-to-face
[15:30] fellowship with the word.
[15:33] An opportunity presented to come into
[15:37] face-to-face conversation with the word.
[15:41] Amen. Now, it is a pure table.
[15:45] That means it is not corrupted by hidden
[15:48] agendas and corrupt conversation.
[15:51] It is a pure table. Now if you just
[15:54] think about that in terms of when you
[15:58] speaking of let's say conversations or
[16:01] negotiations between America and Russia
[16:05] and if you say
[16:08] their conversation was not around a pure
[16:11] table, what do you mean? If you say
[16:14] President Trump's negotiations with
[16:16] President Putin was not around a pure
[16:18] table, what you're saying is there were
[16:21] hidden agendas, there was corrupt
[16:23] conversations, they were holding things
[16:25] back, they were lying to each other, it
[16:28] was deceit, it was a farce, it was maybe
[16:31] um
[16:33] a a deception to the world. It was not a
[16:36] pure table. All right? So when Solomon
[16:39] calls the table of showbread a pure
[16:41] table, he's talking about pure
[16:45] conversation, no hidden agendas, no
[16:50] selfishness of any sort. Let's read Acts
[16:53] 6 and 2. Acts 6:2. This is you'll
[16:57] remember this scenario where the
[16:59] disciples the 12 disciples were um they
[17:04] had baptized so many people and now
[17:07] these people all needed help and people
[17:10] were coming up to them and discussing
[17:12] their problems and asking them questions
[17:14] about their business and what should
[17:15] they do and asking them who should they
[17:17] marry and you know lengthy questions
[17:21] that link to lengthy arguments and
[17:25] lengthy discussions.
[17:26] And so in acts 6 and:e 2 it says then
[17:30] the 12 called the multitude of the
[17:31] disciples unto them. So they called all
[17:33] the other church members and said unto
[17:35] them it is not reason that means it's
[17:38] not logical it's not favorable that we
[17:42] should leave the word of God and serve
[17:44] tables. Okay serving tables one would
[17:48] think they were speaking of being
[17:50] waiters. Absolutely not. Not so they
[17:53] were not they were not saying we should
[17:56] uh it is not reason that we should leave
[17:58] the word and become waiters right they
[18:01] were talking about meeting people and
[18:03] talking about all their problems and and
[18:05] and other things. So they called all the
[18:08] other disciples the 12 called all the
[18:10] other disciples of Christ and said to
[18:13] them basically listen you you guys have
[18:17] to take care of this. You take care of
[18:19] the people and all their problems. leave
[18:21] us to preach the word.
[18:24] So this meant we are not meant to be a
[18:27] part of unnecessary conversations
[18:30] when their conversations were supposed
[18:33] to be solely about the word. The 12
[18:35] disciples were supposed to be their
[18:37] conversations were supposed to be solely
[18:40] about the word. They if if they were
[18:42] called upon they were to talk about what
[18:43] they had seen with Jesus Christ. They
[18:46] they would be called upon to talk about
[18:48] their witness of the death, burial, and
[18:50] resurrection. They were not supposed to
[18:52] be sitting around talking about, you
[18:54] know, how many wives this guy had and
[18:56] how he wants to make his life right.
[18:58] Let's leave that to the other part of
[19:00] the ministry. These 12 was had a
[19:03] specific job. So, here's a question. Why
[19:06] was Christ so angry when he went into
[19:09] the temple and you'll remember he
[19:12] overturned the tables? What tables? It
[19:16] wasn't because the priest had allowed un
[19:19] uh or the priest had allowed gambling
[19:21] and money and that's not what the tables
[19:24] were. Of course, there were those
[19:25] tables. I don't believe it was gambling,
[19:29] but it was because the priests had
[19:31] allowed unholy conversations to come
[19:34] into the tabernacle. It wasn't just
[19:36] literal tables that Christ kicked over.
[19:39] They were discussing politics. They were
[19:42] discussing King Herod and Rome and
[19:45] business and other unholy things in the
[19:48] in the place of God's name. There should
[19:50] never have been any other conversations
[19:53] in the temple but the the the imparting
[19:57] of God's word, the imparting of the
[19:59] wisdom that comes from God's word. Any
[20:02] other discussions should not have been
[20:04] allowed in that place. That was the law.
[20:07] So when Christ came in, he found that
[20:09] the tables were no longer pure.
[20:13] The table of showbread is a pure table.
[20:17] It represents
[20:19] holy conversation.
[20:22] Conversation without hidden agenda.
[20:26] Amen. Conversation,
[20:28] fellowship,
[20:30] intimate fellowship, face-toface
[20:32] fellowship on the word of God. All
[20:35] right. So let's get to the next thing
[20:37] and let's look at the showbread. We we
[20:39] can read from Leviticus 24 and verse
[20:42] 5-9.
[20:44] And it says, "And thou shalt take fine
[20:47] flour and bake 12 cakes thereof." Two
[20:50] tenth deals. Watch this. Two tenth deals
[20:54] shall be in one cake. And thou shalt set
[20:58] them in two rows, six on a row upon the
[21:02] pure table before the Lord. So two rows.
[21:06] So if you if you look at this table, a
[21:08] rectangular table on the two long sides
[21:12] of the table, there would be six loaves
[21:15] and six loaves on the other side of the
[21:18] table.
[21:20] Verse 7. And thou shalt put pure
[21:22] frankincense upon each row, that it may
[21:25] be on the bread for a memorial, even an
[21:29] offering made by fire unto the Lord.
[21:32] Every Sabbath he shall set it in order
[21:35] before the Lord continually being taken
[21:37] from the children of Israel by an
[21:39] everlasting covenant. And it shall be
[21:41] Aaron's and his sons, and they shall eat
[21:45] it in the holy place. For it is the most
[21:48] holy, for it is most holy unto him of
[21:53] the offerings of the Lord made by fire
[21:56] by a perpetual statute.
[21:59] All right. So being technical, we can
[22:02] find many clues in here of God's
[22:05] relationship to the Hebrews.
[22:08] If you look at verse 5, verse 5 shows us
[22:11] that 12 cakes had to be baked. Now, we
[22:15] can already say, well, 12 that speaks of
[22:18] the 12 uh patriarchs, right? The the 12
[22:23] tribes of Israel. Now you'll notice each
[22:28] cake contains two tenth deals
[22:33] or two tenths of a deal which was a form
[22:38] of measuring flour. Now if you take two
[22:42] 10th deals that makes 24/10
[22:47] of a deal. In other words there were 24
[22:51] 10th deals
[22:53] right? 24 measurements, specific
[22:57] measurements to make up the 12 cakes,
[22:59] which actually shows you those 12 loaves
[23:02] of showbread had 24 measures of meal.
[23:07] Symbolic of the future where it would be
[23:10] 24 elders around the throne, 12
[23:13] patriarchs, and 12 apostles. Symbolic of
[23:17] course. Also, a tenth speaks of a tithe.
[23:22] Tithing is a part of worship which is
[23:24] fitting for the inner court as we will
[23:27] find later.
[23:29] All right? Because the inner court is
[23:31] all about worship. In verse six, it
[23:34] shows the bread placed in two rows of
[23:37] six. Of course, six being the number of
[23:40] a man may point us then to the two
[23:42] anointed men.
[23:45] Speaking of Israel, since this is the
[23:46] tabernacle of Israel, this showbread
[23:50] showing two anointed men that are
[23:53] significant in the relationship of
[23:55] Israel to God. Moses and Elijah. Okay,
[24:00] there's so many things that we could
[24:01] pick up in here. Frankincense is one of
[24:04] the most precious, expensive, or was at
[24:08] that time one of the most precious,
[24:10] expensive, favored incense of the east.
[24:14] It is in resin form
[24:18] to be applied upon hot coals and in
[24:22] ointment form to create a scent, a very
[24:25] pleasing scent. It is edible. It is
[24:29] medicinal
[24:30] and with many known healing properties.
[24:34] This frankincense was applied upon the
[24:36] showbread to show as an offering unto
[24:40] the Lord. Again, what does frankincense
[24:42] speak of? worship. Amen. Again, fitting
[24:48] for the inner court because the inner
[24:50] court is all about worship.
[24:53] Now, only Aaron and his sons, according
[24:57] to verse 9, only Aaron and his sons, the
[25:02] priesthood, were allowed to eat the
[25:03] showbread. And on the Sabbath, they had
[25:07] to eat the fully ripened bread now being
[25:11] replaced, right?
[25:14] This is important.
[25:16] So let's look at what this showbread
[25:20] means. So if you go into your Hebrew
[25:23] lexicon or however you want to find out
[25:26] the original word for showbread is P A N
[25:31] I Y M. Panim.
[25:35] Paneim is the word for showbread. But
[25:40] the meaning of panim
[25:42] is face
[25:45] or faces. Right? So if you read in my
[25:48] notes, I've got it there written for
[25:50] you. Face or faces. The the symbolic
[25:53] meaning of that you'll find there in
[25:55] front of or before or to the front of or
[25:59] in the presence of in the face of at the
[26:03] face in front of from the presence of
[26:07] from before. from before the face off.
[26:10] These are all the meanings of this word
[26:12] pane.
[26:13] Right? So it was the bread of the
[26:16] presence
[26:18] or it was symbolic of
[26:20] communion or fellowship
[26:23] face to face. All right. Now you'd say,
[26:26] "But hold on a second. Wasn't the most
[26:29] holy place face to face fellowship?"
[26:34] Absolutely. That was face tof face
[26:36] fellowship. But that was a different
[26:38] kind of face to face. What face toface
[26:41] fellowship are you having here in the
[26:45] inner court? Right? So let's let's get
[26:49] to that. Now interpreting this, we
[26:51] understand that the purpose of the
[26:53] showbread is to show the effects of the
[26:57] presence of God felt from without the
[27:00] veil. That is outside the veil.
[27:04] That's the purpose. So the showbread was
[27:06] an indication that the presence of God
[27:09] when it was when the presence of God was
[27:12] in the most holy place that presence
[27:16] could be felt in the inner court even
[27:19] though there was a thick veil separating
[27:21] it. Beautiful.
[27:24] The worshipper cannot really feel the
[27:27] presence of God that is within the veil.
[27:29] But what this shows us is that the
[27:32] presence of God within the veil can
[27:35] actually be felt without and produces
[27:38] amazing things.
[27:41] Right? So let me explain that. You know
[27:44] you have you know what we're talking
[27:47] about now. You are a three-dimensional
[27:49] being. Your body is your outer court.
[27:51] Your spirit is your inner court. Your
[27:52] soul is your most holy place. The gene
[27:55] seed of God that was in his mind before
[27:57] the foundation of the world is the part
[27:59] that is within the veil inside your
[28:03] soul. That's the gene seed. That's the
[28:06] predestinated seed that came from God
[28:10] that was in the logos. That's the part
[28:12] that's the God part of you that's inside
[28:14] your soul. Now, the truth is if you try
[28:20] some way and you sit at your at at your
[28:24] or in your closet or in in bed at night,
[28:27] you're sleeping, you lie down, you look
[28:29] up at the ceiling, you think, I really
[28:32] want to feel what that gene seed is
[28:35] feeling. I want to know what that gene
[28:37] seed is.
[28:39] You know, in your conscious mind and in
[28:41] your body, you can never just make that
[28:44] happen.
[28:47] You can't you you you can't feel the
[28:49] presence of that gene seed. You just
[28:51] cannot because it's veiled by self. It
[28:55] there's a thick veil in the front.
[28:59] So what this table of showbread is
[29:01] showing us that there is a way for that
[29:05] presence to be felt in your spirit realm
[29:08] in your mind. There is a way for the
[29:12] presence of that gene seed to be seen to
[29:15] be felt
[29:18] in your spirit.
[29:20] And this is how the showbread,
[29:24] right? That's what we're saying. Now,
[29:25] the 12 loaves of showbread to Israel
[29:28] represented the 12 patriarchs, the
[29:30] fathers, the 12 tribes. It spoke of the
[29:33] manifested or written word to the
[29:36] people. How do we know this? Because
[29:40] brother Ben Branham told us, those of
[29:42] you who've read the messages in the
[29:44] revelation of Jesus Christ series, you
[29:46] would remember these things that he told
[29:48] us uh what these um 12 apostles and 12
[29:54] patriarchs represent.
[29:57] So in this tabernacle to Israel, those
[30:01] 12 loaves of showbread represented
[30:05] the testimony
[30:08] of their fathers to them because
[30:11] everything they knew about God,
[30:14] the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[30:18] that's all they knew. So those the
[30:21] testimony of those men was the written
[30:24] word to the people,
[30:28] right? And and whatever they testified
[30:32] of, whatever they passed on was their
[30:35] knowledge of God. And that knowledge was
[30:38] represented in these 12 lows. Right? So
[30:43] only the high priest and the priesthood
[30:45] were allowed to eat it before the veil.
[30:47] This was an important uh thing which
[30:50] meant that it spoke of an inner
[30:53] experience. That means
[30:55] u it was given to the priesthood and
[30:57] they had to express it to the people. So
[30:59] the priest had to eat the showbread and
[31:02] they had to express it to the people. Um
[31:06] they had to be the testimony of this
[31:08] inner experience. Right? In other words,
[31:12] they would have to tell the people that
[31:15] this is what happened with this
[31:16] showbread in the presence of the Lord
[31:17] and and this is the day that we are we
[31:20] have eaten of this right now.
[31:24] Showing that it had to be eaten before
[31:27] the veil means the experience of eating
[31:30] the showbread could not be uh had on the
[31:35] outer court. It it was an inner court
[31:38] experience. It had to be eaten before
[31:41] the veil.
[31:43] That means it had to be eaten in the
[31:45] inner court. Very very important. In
[31:47] other words, to you personally, this
[31:50] experience of the showbread takes place
[31:52] in your spirit realm. You can't transfer
[31:55] it to your body realm. Right now, it was
[32:00] not that the showbread was only for the
[32:02] priesthood. It was actually only for the
[32:05] consecrated
[32:07] for people who had not mixed their lives
[32:10] with sin.
[32:13] At that time it was only the priesthood
[32:15] that qualified because all other people
[32:17] were considered mixing their lives with
[32:19] sin and only the priesthood were
[32:21] consecrated. This bread was not even
[32:24] inaccessible. That means it wasn't as if
[32:27] you couldn't get a hold of it. You
[32:29] couldn't easily get a hold of it. This
[32:30] bread is easy to obtain because it's not
[32:33] within the most holy place. If you went
[32:36] into the into the holy place, into the
[32:38] most holy place, you could you would be
[32:39] struck dead. But if you ventured into
[32:42] the inner court, you could be pardoned.
[32:45] It's not it it wasn't an issue, right?
[32:48] Of course, it was it would be a problem.
[32:50] The priest would shout at you and so on,
[32:52] but it wasn't certain death. If you were
[32:55] a consecrated person, you could come
[32:57] into the inner court. And we know
[32:59] there's proof of that. But I will show
[33:00] it to you just now. But it was basically
[33:02] for the priest because at that time the
[33:05] priests were the only consecrated group.
[33:07] But remember this important thing. The
[33:09] showbread is only for consecrated
[33:12] people.
[33:15] Let's read the thotiry church. It's a
[33:17] quote in the Thotiran church age
[33:19] paragraph 35. Brother Brandon says and
[33:21] now we find out that he also got hidden
[33:24] mana. Now hidden mana is tied to the
[33:25] showbread. The showbread was for the
[33:27] priests only. That is right. Showbread
[33:31] was just for the priest and they it was
[33:34] a special thing made for the priest.
[33:35] That is the leaders. This man overcome
[33:38] the whole congregation got mana but he's
[33:41] got a hidden special man or a special
[33:43] revelation.
[33:45] Oh of who Jesus was and what about him?
[33:49] All about him.
[33:51] So he got that revelation if he
[33:54] overcome. So in other words, the
[33:56] priesthood or the consecrated ones are
[33:58] supposed to receive a special revelation
[34:01] of Christ by the written word. Right? In
[34:05] other words, the showbread indicates a
[34:08] special revelation of Christ, not the
[34:11] outside, not the outside people. Those
[34:13] that are the consecrated ones are to
[34:16] receive a special revelation of Christ
[34:19] by the written word, more than what the
[34:22] leoty receives. And they must express it
[34:25] to the common people. Right? Are you
[34:28] getting it saints? If you are the
[34:29] consecrated ones, you must be feasting
[34:32] or showbread. And if you are, then you
[34:34] were the ones that must be able to
[34:36] express that that uh experience to the
[34:40] common people. Right? Let's read the
[34:42] message unveiling of God. Paragraph 333
[34:46] and 334.
[34:48] What's the shakina glory today? He says
[34:51] to break beyond the veil to see who God
[34:53] is standing before you. See who God is
[34:56] standing before us. The pillar of fire.
[34:58] He is veiled in human flesh. But what
[35:00] does the shikina what did it do?
[35:04] The showbread seed, the word that we're
[35:07] to live on in this day by these
[35:10] promises. The shakina glory ripens that
[35:14] showbread brings it to pass makes it
[35:18] bread to the believer that laid in the
[35:21] pages of the Bible year after year. The
[35:25] word for this age to the denominations
[35:28] it's a stumbling block to the
[35:29] denominations they stumble at it. Down
[35:32] through the years Luther Wesley Martin
[35:35] Luther all Sanki Finny John Smith Knox
[35:38] all stumbled at it. Notice brother Benam
[35:41] is talking about the Bible.
[35:44] What he's saying is the shakina glory
[35:48] must ripen the word in the Bible.
[35:53] See, he was saying that through all the
[35:56] ages the denominations kept stumbling
[35:59] over the written word.
[36:02] But if there is shakina glory
[36:06] to the believer, it must ripen the
[36:09] showbread. It must make it bread to the
[36:13] believer. That means the the shakina
[36:16] glory has to make the Bible bread to the
[36:19] believer. It must make it edible. It
[36:21] must make it uh filling, sufficient. It
[36:25] must make it uh sustaining. Amen. So to
[36:30] the Hebrew people who had no Bible, the
[36:33] written word was the word given to their
[36:36] elders or forefathers. Right? So let's
[36:38] come back and understand now in the in
[36:40] the tabernacle in the in the wilderness,
[36:43] those Hebrew people, they had no Bibles.
[36:46] They had no written word. What was the
[36:49] written word? The written word was to
[36:51] them the word spoken by Abraham, the
[36:54] word spoken by Jacob, the word spoken by
[36:56] Isaac, the word spoken by Joseph in
[36:59] Egypt, word spoken by um all their
[37:03] brothers, Reuben, Judah, Levi, all these
[37:07] brothers, their testimonies, what they
[37:10] said that they experienced with God in
[37:14] their lives, that was the written word.
[37:16] In other words, if you were a a man in
[37:20] that day in the wilderness, all that you
[37:23] know about God was what your ancestors
[37:26] told you. Now you think about it. If you
[37:30] hear the word of your ancestors,
[37:33] can you really
[37:35] properly understand what your ancestors
[37:38] meant? Can you properly figure out some
[37:42] of the stories they told you? I mean
[37:45] just take the Bible for instance, right?
[37:48] The Bible is the thing that we read
[37:50] about and from this Bible there are
[37:52] thousands of denominations that have
[37:55] derived their names, their beliefs,
[37:57] their traditions, their religion from
[38:00] the same Bible all of us are reading
[38:02] which actually shows you that the word
[38:06] of the forefathers
[38:08] needs shakina
[38:11] to make it bread. If it doesn't have
[38:14] shikina,
[38:16] it cannot be sustaining. It cannot bring
[38:19] true fellowship, true conversation, true
[38:22] face-to-face conversation with God.
[38:26] This bread needs to be placed in Shikina
[38:29] glory.
[38:31] Amen. So um this is why at that day his
[38:36] name to them was the God of Abraham,
[38:39] Isaac and Jacob. They had no name like
[38:42] Jesus Christ. They had no name yet like
[38:45] Jehovah Yahweh. They were still they had
[38:48] no association with that name Jehovah.
[38:51] They were the name Jehovah was becoming
[38:54] known to them in that time. But remember
[38:56] when he when Moses went to them in in
[38:59] Egypt, he he asked God what what shall I
[39:03] uh what name shall I give? And he said I
[39:06] am that I am. You shall say I am. I am
[39:10] the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and
[39:12] so on and and then they will recognize
[39:14] him. See, he had to identify himself as
[39:18] the God of their fathers
[39:21] as long as they kept true to that word
[39:23] that God had given their forefathers and
[39:26] kept it hallowed in the inner court. He
[39:29] promised to increase it to them and make
[39:32] it live to them week in and week out. It
[39:34] would become more meaningful. So what
[39:37] does this mean? That means if you were a
[39:39] Hebrew man in the day of Moses and if
[39:43] you held in your spirit, in your mind,
[39:46] in your heart, if you held the testimony
[39:48] of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob close to
[39:51] you, personal to you, treasured in your
[39:55] heart, then God promised that he would
[39:59] make it increase to them. He would
[40:03] increase the thing that Abraham
[40:05] testified. He would increase the thing
[40:08] that Isaac and Jacob testified to them.
[40:10] He would make that bread live, increase,
[40:15] ripen to them. But they had to hold it
[40:19] as hallowed bread in their spirit and
[40:22] their mind. They had to meditate on it
[40:24] daily. Now in our day, the word of our
[40:27] forefathers is the Bible. All that is
[40:30] written therein is the word of God to
[40:32] those generations of long ago.
[40:36] Right?
[40:38] If we can take this hallowed bread, if
[40:40] we can take this the words of this
[40:42] Bible, the words of the message, the
[40:44] word of the Bible, and if we can make it
[40:46] hallowed to us and keep it before the
[40:49] light of the candlesticks, we'll talk
[40:51] about that later uh in another session.
[40:54] If we can take it before the light of
[40:56] the candlesticks, the shakina glory from
[40:58] within the veil will ripen it or expand
[41:01] it or reveal more of it to us. It will
[41:05] make the the the words of the Bible more
[41:08] meaningful. It will reveal so much more
[41:10] to us. It will make our worship more
[41:13] meaningful.
[41:14] Amen. Now, how do we keep this these
[41:18] words hallowed? Hallowed means holy. How
[41:22] do we keep this Bible holy to us? Now,
[41:26] you know, I I must say this to you. Um,
[41:31] this is
[41:33] a very important thing for an individual
[41:36] to consider.
[41:38] You know, a long time ago, I used to see
[41:42] uh, you know, believers walking to
[41:44] church, their Bibles were treasured
[41:48] things that they had. If you walked into
[41:49] a believer's home, you'd see the
[41:51] bestkept thing in the house was a Bible,
[41:54] their Bible, and they were very
[41:57] u protective over their Bible.
[41:59] Possessive in a family, they would say,
[42:01] "This is my Bible. This is your Bible."
[42:03] And, you know, um and we were all that
[42:07] way, you know. We would respect one
[42:08] another. If we went to conventions and a
[42:11] Bible was left on a chair, uh somebody
[42:14] would find it and take it to the front,
[42:16] nobody would steal that Bible. Nobody
[42:18] would page through it and rift through
[42:20] it and and be nosy. It would we would
[42:23] take it to the minister and say
[42:24] somebody's left a Bible and the minister
[42:26] would look in for a name and then they
[42:27] would announce it at the next meeting
[42:29] and say someone has left a Bible here.
[42:31] Will please someone who the person who
[42:33] own it come up here and collect it and
[42:35] it would be handed over respectfully to
[42:37] them.
[42:39] I have seen that respect of a Bible from
[42:42] the time I'm a child.
[42:45] Now, if you read the history of the
[42:49] scrolls of the Hebrews that they kept in
[42:54] the ark of the covenant, they called
[42:57] that that script, that roll of paper
[43:01] with the law written in it. They called
[43:04] it the writing of fire. And those uh
[43:09] priests covered that those scrolls with
[43:12] the cloth. They covered it in a certain
[43:14] way. And when they opened the scroll,
[43:17] they would open it with the cloth so
[43:19] their skin would not touch the pages
[43:22] because they believed that those pages
[43:25] were so holy that their skin was not
[43:29] worthy to touch it.
[43:31] You know, when I consider how those men
[43:34] revered the word, the written word of
[43:38] that time,
[43:40] it it it send chills up my spine because
[43:43] when you consider today, our Bibles are
[43:46] in our iPads, iPhones, tablets, you
[43:50] know, we just scroll on them with unholy
[43:52] hands. We flick through our, you know,
[43:56] our Bibles. we carry them to work.
[43:59] You know, unholy people will just ask
[44:02] us, "Oh, is that a Bible? Can I have a
[44:03] look at that?" And some, you know,
[44:06] degenerate person can just riff through
[44:08] the pages of those holy words. And we
[44:11] ourselves, we could have been in an
[44:13] argument. We could have, you know, done
[44:16] something bad and then we take take up
[44:18] this holy word and riffle our filthy
[44:21] fingers through it. You know, that that
[44:24] respect this generation has. so lost the
[44:27] respect of the word of God.
[44:32] You know, to this day, I I can open up a
[44:34] Bible and place my hand on the pages and
[44:37] just break down in tears because that's
[44:39] how much those words mean to me. Those
[44:43] words are the wisdom of life. They are
[44:45] the word of God, the written word that
[44:47] was expressed through the saints through
[44:50] the ages. If a if there are simple
[44:53] things we could teach our families is
[44:56] respect of the word of God. The written
[44:58] word of God is meant to be kept on pure
[45:03] tables.
[45:04] Now let's look at the characteristics of
[45:07] this bread. All right? And we're going
[45:09] to type it with uh with who we are in
[45:14] this day and and what concerns us in
[45:16] this day. Number one, this bread was
[45:20] actually baked with leaven. Showbread
[45:23] was not unleavened bread. It was baked
[45:25] with leaven. That's why it could rise.
[45:29] It would it could uh expand. It could
[45:32] become a larger loaf in the presence of
[45:35] the Lord. In the light of the presence
[45:38] of the Lord. So baked with leaven. What
[45:41] does that tell us? It is written word.
[45:43] Why? Because written word has the
[45:45] ability to become corrupt by private
[45:47] interpretation.
[45:49] Written word is subject to private
[45:51] interpretation. That's why it has
[45:54] leaven. So the Bible is exactly the
[45:57] point. The Bible is words with leaven
[46:01] because written word is so easily
[46:04] disjointed and misinterpreted.
[46:07] Right? Is important characteristic.
[46:09] Number two, the showbread is halfbaked.
[46:14] Halfbaked bread. It's not fully baked
[46:17] because it it is brought halfbaked into
[46:19] the presence of the Lord. When it's
[46:21] placed on on the table, as it stays in
[46:25] the presence of the Lord, it continues
[46:27] rising until it is fully baked. Right?
[46:31] So, it is halfbaked because it is
[46:33] supposed to ripen in the presence of God
[46:36] before the veil. What does that tell us?
[46:38] that tells us written word, the Bible,
[46:40] the message of the prophet given to the
[46:43] fathers was not complete, was not a full
[46:47] revelation. It was not complete
[46:50] revealing what it had to say. So it
[46:55] being halfbaked, the Bible is actually
[46:57] the halfbaked word.
[47:00] It needs to lay in the shakina glory for
[47:03] it to complete its rising.
[47:06] Right? like a like a loaf of bread in an
[47:08] oven. It has to stay there until it is
[47:12] fully ripened or risen,
[47:16] right? Halfbaked mean meaning if you
[47:18] just take the words of the Bible and eat
[47:21] it halfbaked, it is not completely
[47:24] sustaining. You will never be fully
[47:26] satisfied. Do you understand that? It
[47:30] has to have to lay in the presence of
[47:32] the shakina glory. Number three, it
[47:35] would not be sustaining to eat it while
[47:37] we were making this point just after
[47:39] it's baked. Written word has to be
[47:41] allowed to lay in the presence. That is
[47:44] present day coming or present day
[47:47] revelation. It has to lay in present day
[47:50] revelation for it to be beneficial to
[47:52] you. Right? Point number four, the bread
[47:55] is not common when it is in the presence
[47:58] of God. Right? So if the bread is in the
[48:02] presence of God be in before the veil
[48:06] then that bread is not common. What is
[48:08] what does it mean? If that bread is on
[48:12] that pure table of your spirit and it is
[48:15] resting before your soul and it is being
[48:18] hallowed before your soul. It is not
[48:21] common bread because what is being
[48:23] revealed inside is not common to the
[48:25] people on the outside. Right? But if the
[48:29] bread point number five is removed from
[48:33] the presence if it is placed on the
[48:35] outer court now it becomes common bread
[48:40] and a very important thing. So when you
[48:43] take what is revealed inside of you and
[48:46] you take it on the outside and then you
[48:48] express it to people then it becomes
[48:51] common bread and that's an important
[48:53] thing because it it should become common
[48:55] bread to the public through you.
[48:59] Um and we'll talk about that a little
[49:01] later.
[49:03] Last point there number six. This this
[49:06] is amazing. This bread is not to be cut
[49:09] with a knife. It's meant to be broken.
[49:12] That was the law. It's not meant to be
[49:14] cut with a knife. It's meant to be
[49:17] broken. How beautiful, saints.
[49:20] I I thought about this and and I so
[49:24] thank God for opening this up to me
[49:25] because if you if you think about it,
[49:28] why shouldn't this bread be cut? You
[49:30] don't realize if you take a loaf of
[49:32] bread, it's so annoying to try and break
[49:36] pieces of bread and give it out to
[49:37] people in your family. you, any father
[49:40] or mother in a family will think, "Hey,
[49:42] listen, kids. Just hold on. Let me slice
[49:44] this bread up so we all get an even
[49:46] share, right? And we'll we'll try our
[49:49] best to slice this bread up as evenly as
[49:52] possible." That's not how this bread was
[49:55] meant to be divided. If you cut with a
[50:00] knife, cutting would be subject to
[50:03] evenly divided according to man's
[50:06] discretion.
[50:08] Right? So if you take this bread and
[50:10] give it to somebody and then you slice
[50:12] it up with a knife, what you're saying
[50:14] is you by your own strength are dividing
[50:18] this bread
[50:21] and that's not how it's supposed to be.
[50:23] But if you take this bread and you break
[50:25] it, you will never get the same amount
[50:28] all the time. Broken bread would ensure
[50:32] an amount inspired by the presence of
[50:34] the Lord in the moment. And it will
[50:38] never be handed out the same way all the
[50:40] time. It will always be different shape,
[50:43] different size every time. And that's
[50:46] what makes the expounded written word so
[50:49] beautiful. It is never the same way
[50:52] every time. Therefore, people will get
[50:54] bored when preachers preach the same
[50:57] thing all the time, the same way because
[51:00] they are cutting and slicing it
[51:02] according to their own discretion. But
[51:04] if bread is broken, it is so much
[51:08] sweeter. Amen.
[51:10] Let's move on.
[51:13] Apart from the priesthood, there was a
[51:16] king who ate showbre. The first king to
[51:19] eat showbread. 1st Samuel 21:2-6.
[51:23] And David said unto him the priest, the
[51:26] king had commanded me a business, and
[51:27] had said unto me, let no man know
[51:30] anything of the business where I send
[51:33] thee, and what I have commanded thee,
[51:36] and I have appointed my servants to such
[51:38] and such a place. Now, therefore, what
[51:40] is in thine hand? David is asking the
[51:42] high priest, what do you have for me to
[51:45] eat? Give me five loaves of bread in my
[51:48] hand. Or what here what there is
[51:51] present. And the priest answered David
[51:53] and said, "There is no common bread
[51:55] under my hand, but there is hallowed
[51:58] bread, that is showbre, if the young men
[52:01] have kept themselves at least from
[52:03] woman." And David answered the priest
[52:06] and said unto him, "Of a truth, woman
[52:09] have been kept from us about these three
[52:11] days since I came out, and the vessels
[52:14] of the young men are holy, and the bread
[52:16] is in in a manner common." Yay, though
[52:20] it was sanctified this day in the
[52:22] vessel. I'll explain that. So the priest
[52:24] gave him hallowed bread for there was no
[52:26] bread there but the showbread that was
[52:29] taken from before the Lord to put hot
[52:31] bread in the day when it was taken away.
[52:35] All right. So just to put you in the
[52:36] picture, David was actually lying to
[52:38] this high priest. David was escaping
[52:41] from King Saul after Jonathan told him
[52:43] his life was in danger. So he comes to
[52:46] the high priest. The high priest had no
[52:48] idea that Saul was going to be chasing
[52:50] David and that David was escaping. So
[52:52] David lies to him that he's here on the
[52:54] king's business and he's with a he's
[52:56] with a a group of men um and the men are
[53:01] somewhere else. So he asked him he asked
[53:03] him for five loaves. He wanted five
[53:05] loaves because he wanted to continue
[53:07] running and he wanted food to keep
[53:09] running with. And if you read the story
[53:11] on he asks for the sword for a sword and
[53:15] he gets the sword of of Goliath.
[53:18] But the scripture shows us two things
[53:20] here. David should have died for eating
[53:23] the showbread. But what we see again is
[53:26] that the showbread can be eaten by kings
[53:29] and priests. This is Revelations 5:9.
[53:32] Let's go back to the point we made
[53:33] earlier. The showbread is meant for
[53:36] consecrated people. Therefore, this
[53:39] shows us it's not just for the priests.
[53:42] It was for the priests in Moses day
[53:44] because the priests in Moses day were
[53:46] the only consecrated people. But here
[53:49] David was consecrated. He was holy. He
[53:52] was anointed by Samuel to be the next
[53:55] king. He was allowed to eat the
[53:57] showbread and did not die.
[54:01] But the criterion,
[54:03] this high priest said,
[54:06] uh, if you want to eat this showbread,
[54:09] you um, you need to tell me whether
[54:12] you've been kept from women. And so to
[54:16] be able to eat of the showbread, they
[54:17] had to be kept from women and their
[54:19] vessels holy. So that the showbread was
[54:22] in a manner common. That's what he says.
[54:25] In other words,
[54:27] they were as hallowed. They were holy as
[54:30] the bread.
[54:32] Right? What does it mean for us of all
[54:36] the things the priests asked David? He
[54:39] says if they had least kept themselves
[54:42] from women. He didn't ask about drink or
[54:45] other intoxicants or gambling etc. What
[54:47] is the the spiritual significance of
[54:49] being kept from women? All right. For a
[54:53] church to be kept from women refers to
[54:55] fornications and adulterous affairs.
[54:58] Spiritually it means the conditions for
[55:00] being worthy to eat of the ripened
[55:02] showbread is to be kept from spiritual
[55:05] adultery and fornications.
[55:07] denominational systems and false
[55:09] doctrines. That's what women symbolizes
[55:14] spiritually. You cannot sit at the pure
[55:17] table. You cannot have true fellowship
[55:19] with the written word. You cannot
[55:21] understand the Bible or the message if
[55:25] your heart is divided by love of the
[55:27] world, self-interest,
[55:30] and uplifting the ministries of other
[55:32] men. Saints, your heart and mind must be
[55:35] purely devoted to the word with no
[55:38] hidden agenda.
[55:40] All false influences with which we read
[55:43] the Bible makes our vessels unworthy of
[55:47] the showbread.
[55:49] Amen. But if we cleanse our spirits of
[55:53] these false influences and uh spirits we
[55:58] can receive and and we can receive the
[56:01] ripening of the showbread within our
[56:03] inner court and thereby feel the effects
[56:06] of the shikina glory of God.
[56:09] Glory to God. Amen.
[56:13] So let's bring this down to the
[56:14] tabernacle of man.
[56:17] for us. Every individual being the new
[56:21] tabernacle of God in this day. There's
[56:24] no more tabernacle of Moses. You are the
[56:26] tabernacle of God. Being that new
[56:29] tabernacle, you have the realm of your
[56:32] spirit as your inner court. A very large
[56:36] part of the spirit of man is made up by
[56:39] the mind. Your mind, right?
[56:43] This is the part that takes in the
[56:46] written word. Obviously, you open up
[56:48] your Bible, your eyes fall upon the
[56:50] word. The words of those of that Bible
[56:53] enters through your eyes, goes into your
[56:56] brain, into your mind, and your mind
[56:59] begins to interpret what your eyes are
[57:02] reading. Right? So, a very large portion
[57:06] of your spirit is the mind. The mind is
[57:09] the part that takes in the written word.
[57:13] It is this that is the greatest struggle
[57:16] for some people
[57:18] most a lot of people in the message and
[57:21] Christians is handling the written word
[57:24] and saying this is what the table of
[57:26] showbread is all about. This is what
[57:28] this study is all about. If we don't
[57:30] allow the Holy Spirit to set up a pure
[57:33] table within us then we will always have
[57:36] problems interpreting the written word.
[57:38] But if we have our pure table set up by
[57:42] the Holy Spirit, then we have a constant
[57:44] opportunity of fellowship of the written
[57:46] word. The written word will ripen in the
[57:49] presence of the Lord in our soul. And
[57:51] then our spirits are filled with a
[57:53] worship that is meaningful and constant
[57:56] and wonderful.
[57:58] Glory to God.
[58:01] I want to close this off by reading a
[58:04] few quotes and then a scripture and then
[58:06] we'll bring it to an end. Let's read
[58:08] this from the message the unveiling of
[58:11] God paragraph 304
[58:13] uh onwards.
[58:17] Unveiling of God 1964 14th of June
[58:21] 304 paragraph 304. Notice the old temple
[58:24] had it in the shikina glory. The light
[58:27] of the shikina over the word. The word
[58:30] is a seed. It brought forth the
[58:33] showbread to believers only. There it
[58:37] is. Saints, the showbread is to
[58:39] believers only. Remember, any man can
[58:42] turn the pages of the Bible, but it
[58:44] takes the Holy Spirit to reveal it.
[58:47] Amen. The showbread is for believers
[58:50] only. Everyone in this world knows the
[58:52] Bible. Bibles are in hotels. The Gideon
[58:55] Bible in every single hotel. And people
[58:58] can read that Bible, but they will not
[59:01] understand it. They will struggle with
[59:02] it. They will have strife with it. It
[59:05] can only be
[59:08] a showbread to the believer because
[59:11] there is a light of the shukina of the
[59:14] word in them.
[59:17] Brother says the blood also was upon the
[59:19] covenant and the blood is the water the
[59:22] water that that lifens the grain the
[59:26] wheat the seed which is the word. And
[59:27] Jesus said, as Moses lifted up the brass
[59:30] serpent, then again he said, God so
[59:31] loved the world, he gave his only
[59:33] begotten son, whosoever believeth in him
[59:35] should not perish. Moses smoked the rock
[59:37] in the wilderness to save a perishing
[59:39] people or bring water. God smoked Jesus
[59:42] to bring forth the spirit out of him for
[59:44] a perishing people. The blood came from
[59:46] him which is the water of the washing by
[59:48] the word which the water brings life to
[59:51] the seed and it brought forth the
[59:53] shikina glory shined upon the word which
[59:56] brought forth the showbread and the
[59:59] showbread was just for a chosen people.
[1:00:02] Glory to God. Amen. The showbread saints
[1:00:06] is for you and I. It is for a chosen
[1:00:08] people. Paragraph 306. Now breaking into
[1:00:11] the veil through the veil into his
[1:00:13] presence where the word is not the creed
[1:00:16] the word in there seeing the shikina
[1:00:19] glory the shikina the power the holy
[1:00:22] spirit shining upon the word bringing
[1:00:25] forth the promise shows you're behind
[1:00:27] the veil. Amen. So I want to tell you
[1:00:29] there what this tells us is if you read
[1:00:33] the Bible, if you read the written word
[1:00:35] and the written word begins to reveal
[1:00:38] things and and and bring a feeling of
[1:00:42] the presence of God in your spirit in
[1:00:45] your mind. It shows you have God behind
[1:00:50] the veil. It proves it's your proof.
[1:00:53] Brother Ram said this, right? The proof
[1:00:56] of the Holy Spirit is that is the word,
[1:00:58] the revelation of the word. Right? So
[1:01:02] how do you know that you have the gene
[1:01:04] seed in your soul? The proof of that is
[1:01:06] when the written word starts to speak to
[1:01:09] you. The written word starts to rise.
[1:01:12] The written word becomes showbread fully
[1:01:15] baked showbread in your inner court.
[1:01:18] Glory to God in the highest. Paragraph
[1:01:21] 333 in unveiling of God. Watch this
[1:01:24] shakina glory today to break beyond the
[1:01:26] veil. To see who God is standing before
[1:01:28] you. See who God is standing here before
[1:01:30] us. The pillar of fire. He's veiled in
[1:01:32] human flesh. But what does the shikina
[1:01:35] what did it do? The showbre the word
[1:01:38] that we live we're to live in on this
[1:01:40] day by these promises. The shakina glory
[1:01:42] ripens that showbread brings it to pass
[1:01:45] makes it bread to the believer that laid
[1:01:47] in the pages of the Bible year after
[1:01:49] year. We read this quote earlier. the
[1:01:51] word for this age. I want to get to 335
[1:01:54] because we read 333 to 334 before. 3:35
[1:01:58] says, "But what's it to be done in this
[1:02:01] last day?" What is it to reveal? To
[1:02:04] bring forth. What's Malachi 4 to do? To
[1:02:08] turn back the people from that stumbling
[1:02:10] block. To bring down the traditions. To
[1:02:13] reveal the bread with the shakina glory.
[1:02:18] to reveal the bread with the shakina
[1:02:20] glory. Watch it ripen. Produce just
[1:02:23] exactly what it said it would do. Oh my.
[1:02:26] Showbread for this age to the
[1:02:29] denomination a stumbling block. A bunch
[1:02:31] of fanatics. But we who believe,
[1:02:35] glory to God, saints. So the same
[1:02:37] written word, the same message books
[1:02:40] that's a stumbling block to other
[1:02:42] people, the same Bible that's a
[1:02:44] stumbling block to the entire world that
[1:02:46] was sent to break down traditions. Amen.
[1:02:49] And when it's in your mind, in your
[1:02:52] spirit, and there is shakina glory
[1:02:55] coming through the veil from the gene
[1:02:57] seed of your soul, it will turn that
[1:02:59] written word into showbread for this
[1:03:02] time for you. No one else has that
[1:03:05] privilege saints but you the chosen
[1:03:08] people identified Christ of all ages
[1:03:11] paragraph 42 to 44 until you come in
[1:03:15] behind the badger skin until you get out
[1:03:17] of your old skin your old thoughts your
[1:03:19] old creeds and come into the presence of
[1:03:21] God then the word becomes a living
[1:03:24] reality to you then you're awakened to
[1:03:27] the shikina glory then the Bible becomes
[1:03:30] a new book then Jesus Christ is the same
[1:03:33] yesterday, today, and forever. You're
[1:03:35] living in his presence. Bread of the
[1:03:38] present saints, eating the showbread.
[1:03:41] You're living in his presence. Eating
[1:03:43] the showbread that's only provided that
[1:03:46] day for believers, priests only. And we
[1:03:48] are priests, royal priesthood. Brother
[1:03:50] Maron says, "A holy nation, peculiar
[1:03:52] people, giving spiritual sacrifices to
[1:03:54] God. But you must come into behind the
[1:03:56] veil to see the unveiled God." The God
[1:03:59] and God is unveiled. That's his word
[1:04:00] made manifest. Now today we have so many
[1:04:03] people say well we are as so and so we
[1:04:06] believe it this way. The other group
[1:04:07] says we as so and so we believe it
[1:04:10] [clears throat] this way. See you get so
[1:04:12] many interpretations. You remember what
[1:04:14] we told you uh written word is subject
[1:04:17] to interpretations. Amen. He says
[1:04:20] paragraph 44 God don't need any
[1:04:23] interpreter. He interprets his own word.
[1:04:26] The Bible says it's no private
[1:04:28] interpretation.
[1:04:30] God reveals himself.
[1:04:32] Saints, what does this mean? This means
[1:04:35] that when you read the written word and
[1:04:37] it starts to reveal things within your
[1:04:39] spirit, that is God interpreting his own
[1:04:43] word to you, making the written word
[1:04:47] showbread to the believer.
[1:04:51] Amen. It needs no private
[1:04:53] interpretation. You know, this is so
[1:04:55] beautiful because uh I as a preacher, as
[1:04:59] a a preacher of the word, I can come
[1:05:02] week in and week out in church, read a
[1:05:04] scripture and start to expound on it.
[1:05:07] And [clears throat] anybody can do that.
[1:05:09] But within your spirit, the one that
[1:05:11] makes that scripture
[1:05:14] known to you, revealed to you, that's
[1:05:16] God's interpreting the word. That's not
[1:05:19] me explaining it is not God
[1:05:20] interpreting,
[1:05:23] right? That's me expressing what God has
[1:05:25] interpreted in me. But he's going to
[1:05:27] interpret it in you by the shikina glory
[1:05:30] that is in your soul. Praise be to God.
[1:05:34] God reveals himself. Brother Ram said
[1:05:37] once the believer, this saints, this is
[1:05:40] so important for you young people in
[1:05:42] this time, you older people in this
[1:05:45] time, doesn't matter who you are. Once
[1:05:47] you've tasted of this showbread, once
[1:05:50] this written word is revealed to you in
[1:05:52] the way that it is right now,
[1:05:56] what can you go back to? Is there
[1:05:59] anything else that can satisfy our
[1:06:01] spirits, our minds anymore than the
[1:06:05] showbread?
[1:06:07] Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I have a
[1:06:10] scripture for that as we close. Isaiah
[1:06:12] 28:8-12.
[1:06:16] Verse 8 says, "For all tables are full
[1:06:19] of vomit and filthiness, so that there
[1:06:23] is no place clean."
[1:06:26] Who? Now you know this is about the
[1:06:28] word, the written word. How do we know?
[1:06:30] Because verse 9 says, listen, he's
[1:06:33] talking about tables. All tables are
[1:06:34] full of vomit and filthiness so that
[1:06:36] there is no place clean. Verse 9, the
[1:06:39] next verse says, "Whom shall he teach
[1:06:42] knowledge? Whom shall he make to
[1:06:44] understand doctrine? Them that have
[1:06:46] weaned from the milk and drawn from the
[1:06:48] breast? For precept must be upon
[1:06:51] precept, precept upon precept, line upon
[1:06:54] line, line upon line, here a little,
[1:06:57] there a little. For with stammering lips
[1:06:59] and another tongue will he speak to this
[1:07:01] people. To whom he said, "This is the
[1:07:05] rest wherewith you may cause the weary
[1:07:07] to rest. This is refreshing. And this is
[1:07:11] the refreshing. Glory to God. Yet they
[1:07:14] would not hear. Saints, we have received
[1:07:17] the refreshing. What is the refreshing?
[1:07:20] Because they at that time refused to
[1:07:24] hear the word. He promised he would
[1:07:27] speak to another people with stammering
[1:07:29] lips and another tongue will he speak.
[1:07:33] Now a lot of people say this is uh
[1:07:37] speaking with tongues. This isn't
[1:07:39] speaking with tongues. Stammering lips
[1:07:42] means people that are not even naturally
[1:07:45] gifted.
[1:07:48] Remember Moses said, "I am of stammering
[1:07:50] lips."
[1:07:52] In other words, people who are not the
[1:07:54] obvious choice,
[1:07:56] right? With stammering lips, I will use
[1:07:59] people who are not the obvious choice.
[1:08:02] And another tongue means a different
[1:08:04] language.
[1:08:07] Glory to God. God has revealed himself
[1:08:10] to us by a diff physically a different
[1:08:13] language. No longer Hebrew, God is
[1:08:16] speaking to us and revealing his nature,
[1:08:19] divine nature through the terrible
[1:08:21] language of English.
[1:08:24] Just think about that. Just think about
[1:08:26] that
[1:08:28] uh uh
[1:08:30] um meaning to the scripture.
[1:08:34] Stammering lips and another tongue. Look
[1:08:36] at the the teachers and the preachers of
[1:08:38] this message that God has chosen, the
[1:08:41] ministries that God has chosen to bring
[1:08:44] to us the word of the Lord. Saints,
[1:08:46] every true minister in this message if
[1:08:50] he has an ounce of Holy Spirit in him
[1:08:52] will never have a proud and a hotty
[1:08:56] spirit to believe that he has ability.
[1:08:59] None of us have ability. We are all men
[1:09:02] of stammering lips. We know that without
[1:09:05] this message and the showbread within
[1:09:08] us, we are nothing. We have nothing. We
[1:09:11] couldn't teach anything to the outside
[1:09:13] world, we are useless.
[1:09:15] We are all men of stammering lips. But
[1:09:18] God has chosen stammering lips and
[1:09:21] another tongue, a different language to
[1:09:24] speak to his people. And all other
[1:09:27] tables are full of vomit and filthiness.
[1:09:30] You may find eloquence at other tables.
[1:09:33] You may find people with great charisma,
[1:09:35] great uh intellectualism, people with
[1:09:38] such beautiful language and the most uh
[1:09:43] amazing poetry and and speak with the
[1:09:46] most amazing voices and the most amazing
[1:09:49] charisma in with music playing in the
[1:09:52] background and you will hear all those
[1:09:55] things. But what sustenance is there?
[1:10:00] It's emptiness.
[1:10:01] It's corrupt tables full of vomit and
[1:10:05] filthiness. But come to the word,
[1:10:07] saints.
[1:10:09] Come to the true showbread,
[1:10:12] and you will see an amazing thing that
[1:10:14] God has done in this day. With
[1:10:16] stammering lips in another tongue, he
[1:10:19] has spoken to his people. And this is
[1:10:22] the refreshing.
[1:10:25] May the Lord bless you, bless your
[1:10:27] hearts. Until the next time, amen.
