TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The first coming of Christ is probably the greatest of all types. Amen. &gt;&gt; The greatest of all types because what you see there, I mean those who say his coming is an instant and whatever. The first coming was 33 and a half years. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; The first coming was &gt;&gt; the first coming was the star in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; It was Mary the angel. It was Zechariah. It was uh um uh uh it was uh uh John the Baptist. It was turning water into wine. It was Zakius. It was blind Barameus, the woman at the well. It was everybody, right? &gt;&gt; What do you see there? Is the coming an instant to everybody? &gt;&gt; Now, &gt;&gt; when he came to Nathaniel, was the coming to Zakius? When he came to Zakius, was the coming to B blind Barameus? &gt;&gt; When he was blind bottom, was the coming to the woman at the well? &gt;&gt; When the woman at the well hadn't seen the coming, did it mean he was not there? &gt;&gt; Of course, he was there. &gt;&gt; But the seventh seal has to be open to the individual. &gt;&gt; That's what happens under this mystery. &gt;&gt; Only when it's revealed to you is the coming to you. Which is why we never you don't get stuck with saying 63 February 28th. No, &gt;&gt; of course there's a global thing, but the coming is personal to every person who is called by the Lord Jesus Christ in this last day. &gt;&gt; Look at what happens. Here's John the Baptist. &gt;&gt; He's the prophet, right? He's standing in the water. Something is revealed to him. What is it going to be? Is it going to be my death? Is it this? Is it that you're going to be introducing the Messiah? But what happens? He's standing there in water. He's doing what he's supposed to do. He sees a sign in the heavens. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That vindicates the word. &gt;&gt; He says, "It's my Lord." &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; Their first fold. Then the Lord joins him in the water. &gt;&gt; Pro the prophet said God and his prophet becoming one there &gt;&gt; in the water in the word. Can you accept it? &gt;&gt; Can you see what happened? They're going to say the the prophet is making too much of himself. &gt;&gt; What what happens there? That's not some story. He says, "Lord, I'm not worthy of this. Me baptize you. &gt;&gt; A son of man revealing this son of man, suffer it to be so." &gt;&gt; To fulfill all righteousness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ descending. God descending. And then he goes out and he's left the scene and he's finding the bride &gt;&gt; individually &gt;&gt; while the prophet is continuing &gt;&gt; and you know the prophet said and they ask why does brother still talk about the coming after the coming the coming he says you see what happened with John the Baptist the forerunner he introduced him he ends up in prison &gt;&gt; he said he's seeing what's happening around him you remember 64 when he said I'm it feels like I'm preaching ing the souls in prison. &gt;&gt; Is that the third pool? I've done this. We preached a seal. Something should have happened. Do you not see? Perhaps it's he it's in that message that he said the seventh seal brings him back to earth. &gt;&gt; Feels like the last part he's preaching to souls in prison. He says, uh, maybe the last one has already come in. &gt;&gt; Can it be? You know this. Go read the message if you haven't. &gt;&gt; I hope it hasn't. Right. &gt;&gt; Here was John in prison and he said, brother Ram says in COD question and answer. He said that eagle eye got filmed over. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said he sent his his disciples to say go and ask him are you the one? &gt;&gt; Why? He was anointed to be the forerunner &gt;&gt; when he was not revealing the seals in that time. When he was not Eleaser, he was still a seventh messenger. The seventh messenger is always going to say he's coming. He's coming. He's coming. Because he was still talking to Leodysia. In one message, you see seventh messenger, &gt;&gt; Eliza, &gt;&gt; a son of man revealing the son of man. It just depends on who you are. &gt;&gt; When you're reading &gt;&gt; because when you're reading, you'll have a different experience. &gt;&gt; And then he'll be Elijah. If you read it and you say, "I hate this man." &gt;&gt; Well, then you're reading as Jezebel. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I can't stand him. He picks on me. &gt;&gt; And then or I don't like him. He keeps taking everything. Well, that's Ahab, &gt;&gt; right? Everything from me. He's always persecuting me. &gt;&gt; But if you're the bride, it's Eleazar. It's calling. It's a son of man revealing the son of man. Glory to God. So, you can see whatever you want to see in there, but the bride knows who he is. I want to close it with this one very very significant point. Amen. Few minutes. The mystery of his first coming was his death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the part that was not revealed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. The government shall be upon his shoulder. All the prophecies in there. His coming. His coming. His coming. Remember there the the revelation they had of his coming. The prophet said he was going to be so many feet tall. He's going to have a spear a mile long and &gt;&gt; take all the Romans out and redeem Israel. Remember that? That was their revelation of his coming. &gt;&gt; Sounds very much like the fantasy the denominations have of the coming of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; The prophet said that, right? &gt;&gt; And he he came not the way they expected &gt;&gt; in humility. God hiding himself in simplicity and revealing the same. &gt;&gt; That's how he came. Amen. So here there's a mystery. He came to die. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The Messiah. &gt;&gt; That seven thunder part of his coming &gt;&gt; they could not deal with. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It fooled everybody. &gt;&gt; They were even standing there saying if you are him &gt;&gt; get yourself off the cross &gt;&gt; because we know that's what you're capable of. &gt;&gt; He willed himself to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That spirit to leave him to get heaven. He had to die a man. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him, saints? &gt;&gt; That third fold. So here's what happened. Watch the descent. He suspended between heaven and earth at Calvary. &gt;&gt; What happens when he suspended? It was the word exposed for the world to see. &gt;&gt; And the word says, "If I be lifted up, &gt;&gt; I will draw men unto me." Right? He hung there for a space of time &gt;&gt; between heaven and earth, between two dimensions. &gt;&gt; It was for that moment of rejection. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The world did not recognize him. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's our Lord up there." &gt;&gt; They said, "It's rocket." &gt;&gt; The church rejected him. &gt;&gt; The elect were unsure. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Standing there. How can this be? Hiding in the crowd. Peter denying him. The man with the revelation, thou art the Christ, the son of the living God, and says, "No, no, no, no. You know, I can't really say what it is. I'm not one of them, but I believe in the coming of the Lord, &gt;&gt; turmoil inside, &gt;&gt; because they don't know what to make of this." &gt;&gt; The church went through turmoil when everything started coming out. Oh yeah, it's rocket fuel. Oh, it's this or it's that. No, it can't be. And we got proof and proof and proof and pro and the the silent church is just standing there. What's happening? What's happening? How can this be? Everyone that the elders told us the rapture was going to take place so soon. The redemption was going to happen. What's going on? They all dispersed. The message split up. Peter goes back to nakedness on the boat &gt;&gt; fishing back to where he was called from. &gt;&gt; Everyone dispersed, separated, even the two on the way to Emmas. In the meantime, a second fold is happening. A glorious second fold. &gt;&gt; The son of man is descending further into the regions of the lost &gt;&gt; because that seven seal is about to take away the power of death and hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They did not know what was going on as a total mystery that he would do such a thing and he would take captivity captive. &gt;&gt; He goes, I like the way the prophet says in the atunement message. He walks down the corridor. There's those that knew him. There's those that didn't. And the other one is saying, "That's him. That's him. That's the voice that spoke to us. That's the one that told me this." And he takes the keys of death, hell, and the grave. And he comes back up in the resurrection. And all the things that happen in the resurrection is the unknown language. &gt;&gt; Remember that there's all these disciples, all the people there. And what are these two on the way to Emus said? You know, someone saw a vision of angels and told us he's here. &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on. &gt;&gt; And we don't know what to believe. I mean, there's no quotes for it. I mean, the quotes are insufficient. And we didn't really believe them. And then the others went there and then they saw he's gone. But there's still no quote to say it &gt;&gt; outright [Applause] &gt;&gt; at the rising of the sun &gt;&gt; on the the day after the Sabbath &gt;&gt; in the bride age. &gt;&gt; There's no we're not I don't know why they they're crucifying us for saying bride age as the prophet even says so. We're not in the Pentecostal age. Amen. &gt;&gt; They can't accept us. There's plenty of quotes. We're not Luther. We're not Wesley. We're not in Pentecost. &gt;&gt; We're out of that. &gt;&gt; The rising of the sun in the eighth day, which is going back to the original. A mighty angel descends from heaven cries with a loud voice. You put it all together. Revelations 10. Roman gods traditions are struck. Blind, dead, powerless. Angel rolls away a great heavy seal. Glory. an elected woman sees him, &gt;&gt; not as he was seen before. &gt;&gt; She's she's looking at the word. She's reading it. She's not sure what she's seeing. &gt;&gt; She says, "Have you seen my Lord?" &gt;&gt; He says, "Why seek ye the living amongst the dead?" &gt;&gt; He's not there. &gt;&gt; Where is he? Please tell me where you've laid him. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that revelation. &gt;&gt; Turns around. Name. &gt;&gt; Mary. &gt;&gt; Here am I. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I'm in the right position. I know who I am. He knows who I am. He's called my name. Rabbi. &gt;&gt; That's what happens under the third fold. &gt;&gt; Who knows this? only the elect. &gt;&gt; Does the Pharisees know it? Does the outside church know it? &gt;&gt; No. In fact, the type says the rest of the church put out a lie. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That was purported by the disciples. &gt;&gt; A false doctrine &gt;&gt; to say he's come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the lie was perpetuated. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You want types? Here it is. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they put out a lie to say he's come, but they secretly stole his body. They hatched up some revelation for themselves. &gt;&gt; That's what was going on in the rest of the church. But in secret, &gt;&gt; every elect was being called. &gt;&gt; And everyone was having a different revelation of the coming, &gt;&gt; a personal revelation. &gt;&gt; Here am I. &gt;&gt; I'm the best father. Right? &gt;&gt; Because that's the revelation to me. You're going to have one, too. You're also going to be the best father, but not the best father like me. You're going to be the best father like you. &gt;&gt; See? So, the other one sees him. The others see him on the way to Emmas. Yeah. Then they they all sort of get gathered together by this mystery and they they get to this room. The one leaves there. He appears before Peter. Peters naked in the boat, dives in the water, comes out and clothes himself. The coming brings him back. Restoration. Then they're all getting into this room and then he appears. They're afraid. What is it? Is it corporal body? Is it theophony? What is it? Starts revealing himself to them. No, it's not a ghost. It's me. &gt;&gt; Come. And then there's some doubters there who said, you know what? I'll never believe it unless I see a quote. I'll never believe it unless I feel that. &gt;&gt; All he does is discern it. &gt;&gt; Thomas, it is me. &gt;&gt; Come and feel if you want. It doesn't say he did. &gt;&gt; It just fell on his face. Lord, &gt;&gt; it is you. He saw the sign. He knew it was him. &gt;&gt; And then every other time he appears, he's there on the beach preparing fish. And they come and they're they just seen him. And now they're seeing another type. How is this working? Somebody else, Brother Chad preach, somebody else preaches. Is it really him? And they go up and he speaks and they recognize him &gt;&gt; every time after the that that crucifixion, the resurrection, it's revealing himself to the individual in different ways, in manifold ways. And here's the truth of it. In his resurrection, he only revealed himself to the elect. Did they have any solid proof? &gt;&gt; No. Could they convince anybody else? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Only a personal experience &gt;&gt; and the proof was within them. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if you think you're going to convince everybody. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. The &gt;&gt; proof is within you. &gt;&gt; It is all within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There it is. All of the seven seal in just a few selected types and shadows. &gt;&gt; Go through it yourself. I'm telling you detail verse for verse you will find the seven seal manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll have that experience. Did not our hearts burn within us? Amen. &gt;&gt; Go through it and tell me you don't have a burning heart. &gt;&gt; When what? When the scriptures are made known. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They were not even saying their heart was burning when he was in the inn breaking the bread. Did not our heart burn within us when he spoke to us along the way revealing to us the types in the shadows. The coming of the Lord was something hidden. It's a new fold we never knew before. He never revealed the time nor the hour, but he has hidden it in every type and shadow of the Bible. It behooves you to go back in and walk the Emmas road and get the burning heart experience, saints of God. So now that we know all this, what now? &gt;&gt; You know it, you hear it, you see some of it, what now? Don't try to make it up. Don't try to force it. &gt;&gt; What does your heart tell you? You can listen to what I'm saying and you can be working things in your mind. Oh, he's saying things the prophet didn't say or he's doing things we're not allowed to do. Who allows you to do anything? &gt;&gt; Who disallows you to do anything? You possess the gates of the enemy. You handle the opening and the closing. What you say is what he allows. What you hire is hired. What you fire is fired. You've got to accept your place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you have a burning heart? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; What do you do? &gt;&gt; Surrender.
