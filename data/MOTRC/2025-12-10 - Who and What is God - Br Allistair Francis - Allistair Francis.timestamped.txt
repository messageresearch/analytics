[0:01] Who and what is God really? How can you
[0:05] know there's uh in the Bible
[0:08] under the um the Jewish dispensation
[0:10] when God brought in the book of
[0:11] Leviticus and the Levitical law he told
[0:14] them not to make any idols graven images
[0:18] not to worship anything bird fish animal
[0:22] male female rock whatever it is do not
[0:26] make any image and say that is me and
[0:29] don't worship that as if you are
[0:31] worshiping me that is idolatry
[0:34] Why? Why would he do that? Because when
[0:37] you focus on a form, you you have a
[0:40] nature to obsess on the form. And then
[0:42] humans don't stop there. You start
[0:45] making replicas of that form. You start
[0:47] drawing pictures of it. You then start
[0:50] putting crowns on it. Then you start
[0:51] decorating it. Then you start painting
[0:53] it. Then you put it in some place. Then
[0:55] you start making people pay to see it.
[0:58] Sounds like religion, right?
[1:01] That's why idolatry is evil.
[1:05] Are you with me?
[1:07] &gt;&gt; All right. So, who is God really? And
[1:11] how can we best describe his nature?
[1:13] Okay. So, the best thing to do because
[1:15] you have already come into this world
[1:17] and unfortunately every one of you have
[1:20] been fed a bunch of lies. From the time
[1:23] you could hear and understand and read,
[1:26] you were fed lies.
[1:29] We know this now. Some of you don't know
[1:32] this. You are about to know this. Okay.
[1:34] So, begin to understand who God really
[1:37] is. We first have to tell you what is
[1:40] not God.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; See, all the world has told you about
[1:46] God. And almost everything you believe
[1:48] about God is a lie.
[1:52] So, let's begin.
[1:54] Who is God? This is not God.
[2:01] This comes from medieval paintings,
[2:04] medieval, middle ages,
[2:07] European people
[2:09] who
[2:11] u had these great artists during the
[2:13] Renaissance period, you know, the the
[2:15] period of Leonardo da Vinci and
[2:17] Michelangelo and they're great men,
[2:19] great talented men, but by their artwork
[2:22] they deceived the whole world because
[2:25] God does not have a massive throne in
[2:27] the clouds.
[2:29] That's just false.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:31] &gt;&gt; And he doesn't have winged angels flying
[2:35] around in space.
[2:38] &gt;&gt; And um
[2:40] you know I did this uh I did this um
[2:44] experiment. I do this experiment
[2:45] wherever I go, wherever I preach,
[2:47] especially with young people as well. I
[2:50] tell everybody, close your eyes and
[2:52] imagine God,
[2:54] right? And everybody imagines God like
[2:58] that. How do you how did that happen?
[3:01] How is it POSSIBLE THAT THE ENTIRE HUMAN
[3:03] race imagines God the same way? We live
[3:06] in South Africa where the majority of us
[3:08] are black people. Even black people see
[3:11] a white God
[3:13] and it's got nothing to do with race.
[3:16] I I even asked the the young black kids,
[3:19] who is God? Is he darkkinned or
[3:21] fairkinned? He's fair skinned. He's
[3:23] white.
[3:25] It's got nothing to do with race. Who
[3:27] told you God even has a race?
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Blonde hair, blue eyes, brown hair.
[3:34] What? Why does God even need hair?
[3:38] Does he have a bad hair day sometimes?
[3:40] Why does he have to have a beard?
[3:42] Because in the Renaissance period, a man
[3:44] with the beard showed wisdom, so they
[3:47] drew him with a beard. And then um does
[3:51] he have light shining from him? Does he
[3:53] have a halo around his head? Is he
[3:56] giant? Why does he have to be a giant
[4:00] and have a massive chair? Why does God
[4:02] need to sit? Does he get tired?
[4:08] &gt;&gt; See, I told you it's all been lies
[4:11] and we accepted it and we s we drew the
[4:14] pictures.
[4:16] Nobody sees a black god. I mean,
[4:19] African. And nobody sees an Indian god
[4:22] either. Just they're expecting him to
[4:25] have more arms than normal. Maybe
[4:27] [laughter]
[4:28] nobody does. Uh and this goes into the
[4:31] denomination. This is definitely not
[4:34] God. Can you see that old man? He looks
[4:36] like he can barely move,
[4:39] &gt;&gt; you know. And then I don't know what
[4:41] they're holding. Maybe that's earth.
[4:43] They look giant. And the dove there
[4:46] flying in who knows where. The dove
[4:48] which is an earthly creature is supposed
[4:50] to be the Holy Ghost
[4:53] &gt;&gt; just because of a scripture that says
[4:55] descended like a dove from heaven. Like
[4:57] a dove.
[4:59] But no, there is a winged creature foul
[5:04] bird called the Holy Ghost in these
[5:07] pictures and there's all these people
[5:10] around. They're angels, you know. And
[5:13] the one thing that always gets me about
[5:15] how they paint God is he's so feminine
[5:19] and Jesus,
[5:21] &gt;&gt; THEY LOOK LIKE ALL THEY HAVE IS no
[5:23] muscle.
[5:25] They're just love, right? Compassion.
[5:31] So feminine. I don't get it. They all
[5:33] paint them like that. This children is
[5:36] not God.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; It's been a lie. Okay? And neither is
[5:41] Jesus sitting there next to And they all
[5:44] dressed in robes, you know, like why
[5:45] don't they dress like us?
[5:48] Why do they dress like people from 4,000
[5:50] years ago? What? Did they not get the
[5:52] fashion magazine?
[5:55] They not update themselves.
[5:58] I I told you the reason I speak like
[6:00] this is to mock it
[6:02] &gt;&gt; so you understand it
[6:06] because Okay, let me put it this way.
[6:10] Because of the indoctrination of these
[6:12] pictures, when you see it in your mind,
[6:16] that's what you assume a holy man should
[6:19] look like and a prophet should look
[6:21] like. They should be dressed in robes
[6:23] from 4,000 years ago or 2,000 years ago.
[6:26] Which is why when a a man of God today
[6:29] speaks to you who's dressed like me, you
[6:31] don't consider him to be a man of God as
[6:34] compared with those.
[6:37] And therefore the way you are, you can't
[6:40] even see yourself as a man of God
[6:42] because you just don't compare to that
[6:44] image.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; And this is definitely again not God.
[6:53] God does not care for gold
[6:56] from earth, crowns,
[6:59] an orb from the Catholic Church, and a
[7:04] staff. What is that? What is it? That's
[7:07] like Zeus and Apollo. That's what that
[7:10] is, right? It's not even God. And
[7:12] there's the dove again with a ring
[7:14] around his head this time. And there's
[7:16] clouds. Lord knows where those clouds
[7:19] are.
[7:22] All right. So God is not an old looking
[7:25] white man or light-skinned man or black
[7:27] man or Indian man who lives in the
[7:29] universe and nowhere nowhere live parked
[7:33] somewhere off in a galaxy far far away.
[7:37] No. Right. Not sitting upon a giant
[7:41] throne doing nothing else. What does God
[7:43] do? Nothing else but sit.
[7:46] And all the angels must come in all the
[7:49] time, bowing down, singing choir in
[7:52] heaven. And then there angels bowing
[7:55] down, raising, throwing down crowds. All
[7:57] this happens while this old man just
[7:59] sits and says, "Give me more. Give me
[8:01] more. Come on. Give me more. A little
[8:03] bit louder there, a little bit better
[8:04] this way."
[8:06] Lies.
[8:09] Right. And with Jesus sitting there next
[8:12] to him, you know, usual story, son who
[8:15] doesn't have a job
[8:17] [laughter]
[8:20] making nothing but weird signs
[8:25] like peace and the scout symbol, you
[8:27] know,
[8:29] and all those things. That's all. Jesus
[8:31] is just sitting next to the father doing
[8:34] nothing. Doesn't have a job. The only
[8:36] thing is when some poor soul on earth
[8:38] who has a real problem and needs some
[8:40] help, he whispers in prayer to Jesus.
[8:43] And then Jesus says, "Hey, Dad, got a
[8:45] guy has a problem. Please help him out.
[8:48] He really liked me when I was on earth."
[8:50] That's Jesus's job, apparently.
[8:55] Lies again. And then you know what?
[8:57] Things get really tough. Things get
[9:00] really tough because now there's 7
[9:02] billion people on the planet. You know,
[9:04] Jesus can only hear so many prayers at a
[9:06] time, you know. So, let's employ some
[9:08] saints
[9:10] who will then, you know, Christopher and
[9:12] Martin and Thomas and who else? These
[9:14] these saints. And don't forget Mary.
[9:16] She's also got a heavy schedule. She
[9:17] needs a secretary, you know, and then
[9:20] you pray to them and they'll escalate
[9:23] your prayer to Jesus who will escalate
[9:25] your prayer to God. And hopefully by
[9:27] next year you might get it, you know,
[9:30] before you fill out the pink slip and
[9:31] the blue slip and the yellow slip and
[9:33] reach second floor and third floor. And
[9:35] it's like a like they're telling us it's
[9:37] a business. The business of heaven. You
[9:39] got to go through this one first. You
[9:41] have to go to your pastor and your
[9:43] pastor will take your prayer to saint
[9:44] whoever and the saint lies.
[9:49] AND YOU'VE BEEN SWALLOWING IT. THIS
[9:51] WORLD has been swallowing. Let's not
[9:53] even get to other religions. At least
[9:55] we've got two and a couple of saints.
[9:57] There are others who've got thousands.
[10:00] I don't know how their management goes.
[10:02] Some of them have gods up and below and
[10:04] everywhere. And uh depending on what you
[10:07] want, you have to make sacrifices to
[10:10] wherever to to get some answer from
[10:13] somewhere.
[10:15] Let's not even go there.
[10:18] Okay. This was a lie started by ancient
[10:21] religions. The reason why Christians
[10:23] adopted these things is because of
[10:25] paganism and heathenism
[10:29] &gt;&gt; and because those narcissistic men who
[10:31] wanted to control humanity hijacked
[10:35] Christianity and stuck all the paganism
[10:37] in there and put fear into mankind.
[10:42] God's name is not just Jehovah or Yahweh
[10:46] or Elohim.
[10:48] God does not even need a name to call
[10:50] himself by. Look at just the idea of
[10:53] that. So if you don't pray to God, if
[10:56] you don't call out to God in Jehovah or
[10:58] Elohim or Yahweh or Jesus, he won't hear
[11:01] you.
[11:04] You know, that's a really bad boss.
[11:07] You know, it's like, I need something,
[11:09] but just because I don't use those
[11:12] specific names, he's not going to hear
[11:13] me.
[11:17] Oh, you got to use that name.
[11:19] And here's the problem. This is the
[11:21] reason man always asked for a name.
[11:24] That's why God gave them one
[11:28] and not a name to tie himself down by
[11:31] that this is his only name. THIS IS THE
[11:33] MOST POWERFUL NAME. NO,
[11:36] those names that reveal who God is in
[11:40] that period of time, right? I remember I
[11:43] told you this. He reveals himself to
[11:44] Abraham. He's al Shadai. Then he's he
[11:47] reveals himself to Moses as Jehovah. And
[11:50] then the the name Jehovah is used for
[11:52] some period of time and then u uh
[11:55] Samson's father who's Monoah asks the
[11:58] angel tell us what is your name? He says
[12:00] why do you ask my name? Don't you know
[12:02] it's a secret?
[12:04] How is his name a secret in Monoah's day
[12:07] when you were revealed as Jehovah and El
[12:09] Shadai in other days? Because the name
[12:12] of God is just simply this, the
[12:15] revelation of God for that present day.
[12:18] &gt;&gt; That's what you call on. And you don't
[12:21] call on a name like Alistister, John,
[12:23] Mark, Joseph, whatever. You don't.
[12:26] That's not it. It's a revelation of God.
[12:29] That is a name.
[12:31] See, our names mean nothing. They're
[12:34] just names our parents gave us. You know
[12:36] that they're a form of identification to
[12:38] see who you are in this time. That's all
[12:40] we use names for. Names don't even
[12:43] define you anymore.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Right? Names used to be something that
[12:47] gave you identification, a proper
[12:50] identification of where you came from,
[12:52] who you are, where what your lineage is,
[12:54] which land you come from. You don't even
[12:57] have that,
[12:59] right?
[13:01] It's just names and surnames today. So
[13:04] who God is or what his name was in any
[13:06] time was the was the revelation of him
[13:09] for that time. Amen. And he was the the
[13:13] name Jesus. Now why Jesus is important
[13:16] is the revelation of Jesus. What is
[13:19] Jesus?
[13:21] There's no power in the literal name
[13:24] because we know in Spain there's plenty
[13:26] of Jesus running around kicking a soccer
[13:28] ball for fun.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; Jesus and whatever. Everyone's isus
[13:34] in the Greek and and and uh in all the
[13:37] languages we've got all these people who
[13:38] are named Jesus. They don't walk around
[13:41] with halos and supernatural powers and
[13:44] every time someone shoots them they rise
[13:46] from the dead.
[13:48] No, there's no absolutely no power in
[13:51] that literal name. But there's power in
[13:54] the revelation
[13:55] &gt;&gt; of who Jesus was 2,000 years ago.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:00] THAT'S WHY IT has become the name above
[14:03] all names. It is the most relatable name
[14:07] to humankind.
[14:10] Okay, let's move on. Because of the
[14:13] misunderstanding of who God is,
[14:16] religions that were formed on earth have
[14:18] led people to terrible beliefs, even
[14:21] more terrible ways of worship. Okay? And
[14:26] so this is going to be a minieries. So
[14:27] we're going to get to some other things,
[14:29] but I just want to lay the foundation
[14:30] for today. So
[14:34] these religions that have been fueled
[14:36] and and founded on lies has made life on
[14:40] earth follow a massive and terrible lie.
[14:45] The Lord Jesus came to manifest
[14:49] God in flesh to us. who God really is.
[14:55] Amen.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:57] &gt;&gt; And he told us something important,
[14:59] something phenomenal.
[15:03] God is a spirit.
[15:07] &gt;&gt; That's what he told us. Now, in
[15:09] Christianity, it's been commonly
[15:11] believed that, like you saw in those
[15:13] pictures, God is the father. Jesus is
[15:16] the son of God. Everyone's heard that,
[15:18] right? So they they took God and they
[15:21] made him two people and then they put
[15:23] the dove there, the Holy Ghost and that
[15:24] they are three trinity, holy trinity
[15:27] they call it, right? Christians have
[15:29] believed since they converted from
[15:32] heathenism and paganism. Okay, so for
[15:35] some of you who don't know, heathenism
[15:37] is or heathen is a word in the Bible
[15:40] which means somebody who doesn't know
[15:41] God, somebody who worships God through
[15:44] idols of rock and wood and stone and so
[15:45] on like that. and paganism as people who
[15:48] actually have a belief in they worship
[15:51] the creation the earth trees you know
[15:55] like um not even having to form an an
[15:58] idol or an image they literally worship
[16:00] the creation they have you heard of what
[16:03] is it ga earth mother and a whole lot of
[16:07] other things uh we did some of it some
[16:09] time ago in different teachings but
[16:11] that's what paganism basically is about
[16:14] and they have these very some of them
[16:17] very nice, fascinating rituals, you
[16:19] know, different kinds of weird prayers
[16:21] and meditation and, you know, burning of
[16:24] incense and beliefs in in in rocks and
[16:27] minerals and uh um gases and airs very
[16:31] very um creationbased, right?
[16:36] And so when Christianity came to the
[16:40] Gentiles, because we already had those
[16:43] things, we put them into Christianity,
[16:47] right? So the Lord Jesus himself in the
[16:51] words recorded of him seems to give
[16:55] glory to the father. We know that,
[16:59] right? And so the father they what
[17:02] happened with heathenism and paganism is
[17:05] they said the father is god in his own
[17:08] form in his own body and Jesus is the
[17:11] son of god in another form in his own
[17:14] body and that according to the bible is
[17:17] absolutely false.
[17:19] &gt;&gt; I the lord your god am one lord. You
[17:22] shall have no other god beside me.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. There is no second person or third
[17:28] person. He is one Lord.
[17:32] Okay. Already people be confused like
[17:35] okay but what about the father? What
[17:36] about the son? Well we've taught you
[17:38] that. So Christians have argued about
[17:41] this for over 2,000 years. And it's
[17:45] separated Christianity separated into
[17:47] many groups. Some of them are called
[17:48] trinitarians. They worship and they
[17:51] believe they hold as the foundation of
[17:53] their belief the holy trinity. And then
[17:55] you have the others who are oneness,
[17:58] right? Just one. Jesus is that body that
[18:01] is God. It's like the idol. And it's not
[18:04] exactly the oneness doctrine of the
[18:06] oneness Pentecostal movement. But then
[18:08] it separated people into different
[18:10] groups. And then there's others who
[18:11] believe in a two-part godhead, father
[18:14] and son. So the real problem is
[18:18] all Christians today cannot agree on who
[18:22] God is. Is the father God? Is Jesus God?
[18:26] Is the Holy Ghost God? Is the Holy
[18:28] Spirit and the Father the same person,
[18:30] the same being? Are they not? Why are
[18:32] they not? All these questions and they
[18:35] just circle it. They skirt the issue.
[18:38] They don't answer the questions. So,
[18:40] what does the Lord Jesus himself say?
[18:44] All right, are you with me?
[18:46] &gt;&gt; We're going to have a really fascinating
[18:48] discussion about uh this particular
[18:50] situation. John 4:24,
[18:54] God is a, this is the Lord Jesus
[18:56] speaking, God is a spirit, and they that
[18:59] worship him must worship him in spirit
[19:03] and in truth. We're going to break that
[19:05] down for you, right? But firstly, if
[19:08] Jesus was God, why now? He's a he's a
[19:12] man standing there speaking to the woman
[19:14] at the well and he says God is a spirit
[19:18] and if you worship him you must worship
[19:19] him in spirit and in truth. Why is he as
[19:23] a man standing there? If he was God why
[19:25] is he saying God is a spirit?
[19:29] Why didn't he just say I am God? This is
[19:32] what all those Christians who are
[19:34] trinitarians will tell you. Why didn't
[19:36] he just say I am God? Why didn't he just
[19:39] tell the people what they wanted to
[19:40] hear? He was definitely Christ was
[19:43] definitely speaking in harmony with the
[19:45] rest of the scriptures. Why? Because
[19:48] when God spoke to Moses through the
[19:50] pillar of fire, was the pillar of fire
[19:52] God?
[19:54] No. The pillar of fire was the veil
[19:57] through which the spirit of God spoke.
[19:59] When he spoke through the pillar of
[20:01] cloud, was the cloud God? No. He spoke
[20:04] through the cloud. He used the cloud as
[20:06] a veil to hide whatever there was to
[20:10] hide. Are you with us?
[20:12] &gt;&gt; And so in the same way when he spoke
[20:15] through angels, when he came as the
[20:17] angel of the Lord speaking to Samson's
[20:19] father, the angel itself was not God,
[20:23] but the spirit was God.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so in Jesus Christ, he did
[20:30] Christ never asked us to make idols of
[20:33] that body.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; That's right. and make figures and
[20:36] statues and pictures and worship the
[20:39] picture or worship the statue or worship
[20:41] the body. That would be incorrect with
[20:45] what the Bible teaches.
[20:46] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; The vessel or the veil or the body is
[20:52] what he hides himself behind.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the Bible. Okay. So uh we
[21:00] also have to make a note that he was not
[21:03] speaking the this is what I love about
[21:05] the situation. Christ here is not
[21:09] speaking to great theologians in Bible
[21:11] schools and professors and holy men and
[21:14] kings. He's these profound words are
[21:19] being spoken to a nobody.
[21:23] A woman who's rejected.
[21:26] SHE'S NOT EVEN JEWISH for crying OUT
[21:28] LOUD. SHE'S NOT EVEN ISRAELITE. He is
[21:30] supposed to be an Israel. He's an
[21:31] Israelite apparently. And he's speaking
[21:33] to them to her. And she even says to
[21:35] him, "You're not supposed to be speaking
[21:37] to me according to the law because
[21:39] Samaritans were outcast people. They
[21:41] were literally Gentiles
[21:44] who had ties by blood somehow to
[21:47] Abraham." Right?
[21:49] So, um he's not speaking to even holy
[21:53] men. This this passage of scripture WITH
[21:57] THIS PROFOUND UNDERSTANDING OF GOD is
[22:00] not even spoken to a church or holy men
[22:03] or priests or prophets. It's spoken to a
[22:07] nobody.
[22:09] That's what I find so amazing about it.
[22:11] Okay, I'll I'll stop my amazement for
[22:14] another time. But we also have to make
[22:17] note that he was he was speaking to
[22:19] somebody who are you all with me? HE DID
[22:24] NOT HAVE TO DO miracles for her.
[22:27] He didn't have to do any healing. He
[22:30] didn't have to do any spiritual event.
[22:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't have to raise someone from the
[22:35] dead.
[22:37] She was not even an Israelite.
[22:40] All he did was speak the word
[22:44] &gt;&gt; and the truth to her.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; That's what I like message people to
[22:50] wake up and believe here and see.
[22:53] to everyone else. He had to do some
[22:56] miracle. He had to heal the leper, heal
[22:59] the sick, open the eyes of the blind,
[23:02] raise the dead, uh feed the 5,000 with
[23:06] with uh five loaves of bread and two
[23:08] fishes. But with this woman, he just
[23:11] sits there and talks to her
[23:14] and reveals the most profound message in
[23:17] all scripture.
[23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:22] All he did was speak the truth. Come on
[23:25] now. Let's wake up. Why am I telling you
[23:28] this? Because this is what he's doing
[23:29] with us.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; This is exactly what he's doing with the
[23:34] bride today.
[23:35] Everyone else is running around
[23:37] searching for miracles. I won't believe
[23:38] in God unless he heals me of cancer. I
[23:40] won't believe in God unless he does this
[23:42] for me. I won't believe in God unless he
[23:44] gives me this miracle. And churches are
[23:46] even uh advertising, COME TO OUR CHURCH
[23:49] FOR a miracle.
[23:51] Why can you not believe God's word
[23:53] without a miracle?
[23:57] &gt;&gt; All he did was speak the truth. He spoke
[24:00] the most amaz I want you to go back home
[24:03] today, sit down at lunch and read John
[24:06] 4, the chapter John 4. Right? I want you
[24:09] to have a look at this conversation that
[24:11] he spoke with this woman at the well.
[24:13] It's fascinating,
[24:15] right? All he does is sit there and
[24:18] speak the truth to her. The
[24:21] unadulterated truth.
[24:24] No, no holes barred, no punches held. He
[24:27] just tells her the truth, right? And he
[24:32] spoke the most amazing mystery to this
[24:35] unknown woman.
[24:37] And after this great verse of saying,
[24:40] "God is a spirit. They that worship him
[24:42] must worship him in spirit and in
[24:43] truth." Yes.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; She then says this. The woman said unto
[24:48] him, I know that when Messiah comes,
[24:51] which is called Christ, so she knows
[24:54] about Messiah and she knows about
[24:56] Christ. When he has come, he will tell
[24:59] us all things.
[25:01] Verse 26,
[25:03] Jesus said unto her, I that speak unto
[25:06] thee am he.
[25:09] He did not admit this to any other
[25:13] person
[25:14] &gt;&gt; in scripture
[25:16] &gt;&gt; to nobody else to not even the
[25:19] disciples.
[25:20] Not even the the people who not even his
[25:24] mother
[25:26] mother not even his village. Not even
[25:29] the people who tried him. Not the high
[25:32] priest. Not any holy man. He says it TO
[25:36] THIS WOMAN. EVERYONE ELSE HE SPEAKS
[25:38] ABOUT THE SON OF man shall do this, the
[25:40] son of man shall do this if you believe
[25:41] in my words and so on. This is the only
[25:44] person in all scripture that he says I
[25:48] am the Messiah.
[25:50] &gt;&gt; I AM THE CHRIST. I am he.
[25:54] &gt;&gt; I that speak unto thee am he.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; This is phenomenal. This is why I'm
[26:00] saying you really need to go and read
[26:01] this and chew the cut here. Right? When
[26:04] she hears him conclude John 4:24 and she
[26:07] said and and when he says God is a
[26:10] spirit and if you worship him, you must
[26:12] worship him in spirit and IN TRUTH. HER
[26:15] REACTION TO THAT VERSE to those words is
[26:19] we know that when Messiah comes, he will
[26:22] tell us all things. It's related. She
[26:26] didn't just come up with some
[26:28] &gt;&gt; something to say. She didn't just SAY
[26:31] THOSE WORDS. SHE WAS SAYING THOSE words
[26:33] in reaction to we have to worship him in
[26:36] spirit and in truth.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; So why is she saying Messiah will tell
[26:40] us all things? Because all things were
[26:42] not yet told.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, she's saying how are WE
[26:46] GOING TO WORSHIP him in truth?
[26:49] &gt;&gt; If all THINGS ARE NOT TOLD,
[26:51] &gt;&gt; you understand it now. There we go.
[26:54] &gt;&gt; So she knew there was a need for all
[26:57] things. She knew there was a need for
[27:00] the truth to be told. She knew THAT HE
[27:03] WAS TELLING her things already that was
[27:05] stirring up her heart and things nobody
[27:08] ELSE HAS EVER SPOKEN to her before. She
[27:11] had a sense
[27:14] &gt;&gt; that this is he.
[27:17] &gt;&gt; This is the reason why she even said
[27:19] that. We know that when Messiah who is
[27:21] called Christ when he comes
[27:24] see then he tells her the ultimate
[27:26] truth. I that speak unto thee am he.
[27:29] This is incredible. No theatrics,
[27:32] no speaking in tongues,
[27:35] &gt;&gt; no prophecies,
[27:37] no raising of the dead, no healing of
[27:39] the body, no miracle. She went away
[27:43] without any miracle being done for her.
[27:45] IN FACT, HE JUST TOLD HER THE BRUTAL
[27:48] TRUTH. You're a sinner. YOU'VE HAD FIVE
[27:50] husbands and the one you're living with
[27:52] is not even yours. right there. She
[27:54] should have turned around and said, you
[27:56] know, like we are today, who do you
[27:57] think you are? Like, WHAT IS YOUR
[28:00] PROBLEM? WHO DIED AND MADE YOU GO? WHY
[28:03] ARE YOU JUDGING me like the young people
[28:05] today? So judgy.
[28:08] H no, nothing. She just sat there and
[28:11] listened.
[28:13] Imagine, and this is why I say with
[28:16] church people, it's like we have to
[28:18] constantly deal with you with kid
[28:20] gloves. Imagine if I had to come and
[28:22] start off with you teaching you the word
[28:25] and start by judging you, start by
[28:27] telling you what's wrong with your life.
[28:29] You wouldn't even last 5 minutes.
[28:34] You'd be like, "Excuse me, I don't need
[28:35] to listen to this.
[28:38] I I'm asking you today, if Christ came
[28:40] to you and started with what's wrong in
[28:42] your life, how would you accept it?
[28:46] If you can't accept it from me, who is
[28:49] your brother? you think you're just
[28:51] going to accept it from Christ?
[28:54] And he started there and went on with it
[28:59] and she sat and listened
[29:02] despite the judgment that just came.
[29:07] Incredible.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; This is amazing to me that all message
[29:11] people need to see but cannot see. Why
[29:14] can you not listen when he speaks to us
[29:17] like he spoke to the woman at the well?
[29:20] Why do we behave like the 5,000 who WERE
[29:23] FED WITH FIVE loaves and two fishes?
[29:26] How did they behave? THEY WERE JUST FED
[29:29] BY AN ABSOLUTE MIRACLE. They should have
[29:32] fell down there and worshiped God and
[29:34] said, "We believe you, our Messiah. We
[29:37] are we understand all things now. We
[29:39] believe it. We have seen it for
[29:41] ourselves. Uh we will worship. Tell us
[29:43] anything we must do and we shall do it.
[29:45] WE WILL LAY DOWN OUR LIVES." INSTEAD,
[29:48] they followed him across the Sea of
[29:49] Galilee wanting more food.
[29:53] And then HE STARTED SPEAKING TO THEM the
[29:55] brutal truth. And he said, "You seek
[29:58] meat that perishes.
[30:00] You want earthly blessings." In other
[30:02] words, I am the bread that came down
[30:05] from heaven. He starts speaking third
[30:07] ministry.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "Your fathers looked for for
[30:10] meat that perisheth and they died in the
[30:12] wilderness. The bread that I give you
[30:14] will give you eternal life.
[30:16] And then he GOES ON AND EXPRESSES THE
[30:19] MYSTERY. Eat my flesh and drink my
[30:21] blood. And they couldn't understand.
[30:25] He was not talking about physically
[30:26] eating him. Of course, he was talking
[30:28] about his word that they should believe
[30:31] his every word. They all turned against
[30:34] him, including the 70 disciples,
[30:38] the 70 disciples WHO HAD RECEIVED THE
[30:42] SPIRIT OF GOD FROM HIM TO GO AND CAST
[30:44] out devils and do healings. They all
[30:46] turn away from him when he spoke the
[30:48] brutal truth
[30:51] which tells you that the majority of
[30:53] people in the world if Christ should
[30:55] come like they want him to like they
[30:59] claim he's coming will reject him again
[31:03] &gt;&gt; because they did it the first time. I
[31:06] this is to me the the uh the idiocy of
[31:10] humans today to think that they've been
[31:14] waiting for Jesus to come the second
[31:16] time for so many years and that now if
[31:19] he comes we will believe him.
[31:24] This is the reason I say his idiocy IS
[31:26] BECAUSE HE ALREADY CAME THE FIRST time
[31:29] and only 12 believed
[31:32] &gt;&gt; 11. AND THE THE BIGGEST CHURCH HE HAD
[31:34] was 120
[31:37] &gt;&gt; who were left after he had ascended. You
[31:39] mean the Messiah himself couldn't have a
[31:41] 24,000 seater church,
[31:44] 50,000 SEATER CHURCH? YOU MEAN GOD
[31:47] HIMSELF made flesh couldn't be so
[31:49] convincing to have the greatest church,
[31:52] the greatest movement?
[31:54] IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS THE TRUTH THAT the
[31:57] whole world rejected him. Yeah. Amen.
[32:01] &gt;&gt; And this is why I say it's idiocy to
[32:04] think that now
[32:07] Christians believe if he comes, if he
[32:09] shows himself, if he comes flying in the
[32:11] clouds and billowing in those clothes
[32:13] that they painted him in and he's just
[32:15] standing there in the heavens and and uh
[32:17] Jesus comes a second time and the
[32:19] trumpets are blowing and all the world
[32:20] is just going to say, "Oh my goodness,
[32:23] it's Jesus." All the Hindus and Muslims
[32:25] and poor people who didn't believe in
[32:27] Christ will say we were wrong. Let's all
[32:29] bow the knee and every tongue confess
[32:31] that Jesus is Lord. Lies.
[32:34] &gt;&gt; No one's going to believe it.
[32:36] I told you the first thing is the new
[32:38] generation will say that's some kind of
[32:40] hologram.
[32:42] &gt;&gt; CNN will be saying, "What is this? This
[32:45] is some some new scientific thing.
[32:47] People are flying in the sky. It cannot
[32:49] be." THEY WILL DO EVERYTHING IN THEIR
[32:51] power to speak against it.
[32:53] BECAUSE THE WORLD DOESN'T WANT CHRIST.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; They want lives
[33:01] &gt;&gt; like they're leading now. They want sin.
[33:04] They want Netflix. They want movies.
[33:07] They want awful music. They want uh
[33:12] fornication, drugs, alcohol. They would
[33:16] rather drink themselves till they are
[33:18] drunk and passed out than ever hear the
[33:21] truth.
[33:23] They want to watch the rugby and drink a
[33:25] whole bunch of beer and belch like a
[33:27] sailor.
[33:29] They want to waste their time spending
[33:32] money on idiotic things. Nobody cares
[33:36] for the truth. And they all are saying
[33:39] in their drunken stuper that they are
[33:41] waiting for Jesus to come.
[33:44] Let's go to church on Sundays for Easter
[33:47] and Christmas
[33:50] and maybe Jesus will accept us.
[33:54] That's Christianity today. That's why I
[33:57] say to you, that's why we're getting
[33:58] more atheists because the Christians
[34:00] themselves don't believe
[34:03] &gt;&gt; and are not ambassadors at all of the
[34:05] word.
[34:06] So what is outstanding here is that if
[34:10] they fail to hear the word,
[34:13] if the people of earth today failed to
[34:17] hear and believe the word of God, God
[34:21] cannot even reveal truth to you.
[34:25] I am he.
[34:28] That's you know what I see in there? I
[34:31] am he. you that there's so much in there
[34:34] that's also saying I am here.
[34:38] I am here. The one you've been waiting
[34:40] for. I am here.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; I have come. I've been here for the last
[34:45] 30 years.
[34:47] Can you imagine all that dawning on her
[34:49] right there in that moment? That's what
[34:53] we read this Bible like a book of texts
[34:55] and scriptures. We don't get ourselves
[34:57] into the stand on the ground at the at
[34:59] the well where she stood and feel it.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; I am here. I am he. I have come. I'm the
[35:08] one the world has been looking for. And
[35:10] she's sitting there regarding this man
[35:12] who just looks like a normal man. You
[35:15] mean no halo,
[35:17] no uh supernatural powers,
[35:20] not doing anything fantastic. He looks
[35:23] tired, dusty from the travel. He looks
[35:26] thirsty and even hungry. He looks even a
[35:29] little bit sleepy. You mean that is God
[35:32] made flesh, the Messiah, the Christ?
[35:37] I am here going back to John 4:24. So,
[35:41] let's just read that quickly.
[35:45] I want to get to the next part. All
[35:46] right? And then we'll come back to God
[35:48] as a spirit. They that worship him must
[35:51] worship him in spirit and in truth.
[35:53] Okay, everybody from this church, you
[35:56] know what worship means. What is
[35:57] worship?
[35:59] To submit to. Worship in the Bible
[36:03] actually means to bow down to something.
[36:05] And I'll say it again. We all know this
[36:08] in English. We've known this for many
[36:09] years. You call a magistrate of the
[36:12] court your worship,
[36:15] right? You know, nobody goes to court
[36:17] and sings hymns and psalms to the
[36:19] magistrate.
[36:21] Praise be the magistrate.
[36:23] Hallelujah. That's not worship.
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Shouting hallelujah and singing and
[36:29] praying, that's not worship.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; That's praise.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. You can praise something and not
[36:39] worship it.
[36:42] That means you can sing to Jesus, you
[36:44] can sing to God, but in your heart you
[36:46] don't submit to his word. That's just
[36:49] praise. That's not worship. That's the
[36:52] same as when you're married and uh let's
[36:55] say you're you're the wife and you're
[36:57] supposed to submit to your husband and
[37:00] you give him gifts and you you um bestow
[37:03] praise upon him, but in your heart you
[37:05] don't really submit to him. You
[37:07] understand?
[37:09] So it's it's we do this all all around
[37:11] the world today. We give gifts. We give
[37:14] praise. We say to uh everybody good job
[37:19] inside he's still an idiot,
[37:22] &gt;&gt; right? You deserve A GIFT. WELL DONE.
[37:26] Your boss tells you well done. Gives you
[37:28] some promotion incentive. In the
[37:30] meantime, he's got you where he needs
[37:31] you.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:34] H
[37:35] worship does not mean singing and
[37:38] praising. Worship is not prayer. Worship
[37:40] is not uh uh reading your Bible. Worship
[37:45] is not kneeling down. Worship is not
[37:48] closing your eyes like you make yourself
[37:49] look so serious.
[37:53] Praise be to God. No. That's religion,
[37:56] tradition, praising. Anybody can do that
[38:01] and bluff us. And there's no submission
[38:04] inside.
[38:06] Okay. To worship means to submit to a
[38:11] leadership.
[38:15] [clears throat] So how do you worship
[38:17] God in spirit and truth?
[38:20] How do you submit to him in spirit and
[38:24] truth? The first thing is you've got to
[38:27] say God is my headship. God is my
[38:30] leader.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Right? So two things. One, how do I
[38:36] submit to the leadership of God in
[38:39] spirit first?
[38:41] Then how do I submit to the leadership
[38:43] of God in truth? Second, right? In
[38:47] spirit
[38:49] means not by works, not by religion,
[38:54] uh not by the mind, not by reasoning,
[38:58] but from deeper within.
[39:02] deeper than that. Okay? Not by works of
[39:06] the flesh or by this is why Christians
[39:09] and all religions they do their due
[39:12] diligence. They go to church. They do
[39:15] their prayers. They do their sacrifices.
[39:17] If you're not a Christian, the they pray
[39:19] five times a day or something or they
[39:22] dress in holy garb clothes or they do
[39:26] some tradition of religion. That is not
[39:29] worship. That is works which is only
[39:33] visible to the eyes of men. That's the
[39:36] reason why most religious god-fearing
[39:40] people are frauds
[39:43] because they have a cloak of religion
[39:47] acting as if they believe in God for
[39:49] their own gain.
[39:53] That's not submission. That's not
[39:55] worship.
[39:58] That's works for men to see. Right? Then
[40:03] in truth, how do I submit in truth? In
[40:06] truth means not in the knowledge of man.
[40:11] So you can't submit to God with the
[40:14] knowledge that man can give you, right?
[40:19] Not by education.
[40:21] You're not going to be closer to God. In
[40:23] fact, the more educated you are, the
[40:25] further you get away from God. Because
[40:27] education today is going to lead you
[40:29] away from believing in God. It's going
[40:31] to tell you God doesn't exist and
[40:33] science proves this and science proves
[40:36] that and and uh quantum physics shows
[40:38] this and biology shows that and
[40:40] anthropology shows that and and uh
[40:42] paleontology shows that. The more you
[40:45] learn, the further and further you get
[40:46] away from believing in God.
[40:49] You cannot serve God. You cannot submit
[40:51] to him by education. Which is why most
[40:53] educated young people today expect to be
[40:57] convinced of God like the way the
[40:59] universities convince them. Show me
[41:02] evidence.
[41:07] You know
[41:10] almost all the evidence we have today is
[41:12] so small, so minute, it's so ridiculous.
[41:17] You know, I was I was talking to our our
[41:20] um family a few weeks ago.
[41:25] Um and you know, I was showing them if
[41:27] you take the Earth,
[41:31] uh let's say the Earth was I don't have
[41:33] a ball here, but let's say the Earth was
[41:35] that big, right? The furthest our
[41:38] satellites,
[41:39] okay? The furthest our satellites have
[41:41] moved outside of our Earth is that far.
[41:47] that far. Can you see?
[41:50] That far. We're not moving in space that
[41:54] far away.
[41:56] That means even all the pictures they
[41:58] show you of Earth is a projected image.
[42:01] We don't have the capacity to take that
[42:03] picture.
[42:05] And then they oh the web telescope and
[42:07] this telescope. No, those telescopes
[42:09] which have gone off in in a distance
[42:12] have to accumulate images that they get
[42:14] to form a picture. We don't even have
[42:17] the capacity to take a picture of the
[42:19] planet.
[42:21] But we sell the images to our kids.
[42:25] This is it. This is we can barely
[42:27] survive that much past the earth. And
[42:31] those people who do those jumps from
[42:33] space and whatever, can you can you
[42:36] imagine? That's as far as we can get
[42:39] with this the great science today that
[42:42] proves God doesn't exist. That's as far
[42:44] as we can travel.
[42:50] That tells you how elaborate the lie has
[42:52] to be.
[42:54] &gt;&gt; See, to disprove God, you've got to
[42:56] create the most elaborate lie. And the
[42:59] amazing thing is we've got these
[43:00] screens, these HD pictures, these um
[43:04] amazing uh stories that people can come
[43:06] up with, the story of life and
[43:08] paleontology and the dinosaurs. And we
[43:11] don't even have enough evidence on the
[43:13] dinosaurs to fully construct and know
[43:15] what an actual dinosaur fully looks
[43:17] like.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; There's so much of lie in there that
[43:21] creates the image. We use computer
[43:23] imaging. Young people, computer imaging.
[43:26] Oh, THEY USE COMPUTER IMAGING. HOW DOES
[43:29] computer imaging work? THEY HAVE TO PUT
[43:31] DATA into the computer
[43:34] &gt;&gt; to form the image. If if you gave the
[43:37] computer the knowledge of God, would it
[43:39] form that image?
[43:42] &gt;&gt; So, how do you even know what the
[43:44] dinosaur if we don't tell them make it
[43:46] look lizardlike?
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Make it have scales.
[43:51] The computer is a machine. It doesn't
[43:53] know what's feathers and scales and all
[43:55] of that. You've got to put in the data.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; YES.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; THEN PUT ALL your other stuff in. And
[44:01] then this this thing will make an image
[44:04] based on what you programmed it to do.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; The rest is human imagination.
[44:12] Okay. So, we don't really know whether a
[44:14] T-Rex and why is it only found in North
[44:16] America where all the greatest liars
[44:18] are.
[44:21] Hey,
[44:24] the ones that fool the whole world. Why
[44:26] Why don't we find T-Rexes here? Why
[44:29] aren't we finding Diplodocus here in
[44:30] Africa? This is where all the big
[44:32] animals deserve to be. This continent,
[44:36] the big five. We should have an even
[44:37] bigger five somewhere else. No, no
[44:40] dinosaurs here.
[44:42] H Well, at least not like that. No, we
[44:45] get the the luxury of all the small
[44:47] minute fossils, you know.
[44:50] No people, it's what man put into the
[44:53] computer and what that's what spits it
[44:55] out.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Truth is not by the knowledge of man,
[44:59] not by traditions. You can't serve God
[45:01] in truth by fear for selfish reasons,
[45:04] not by histories.
[45:07] There's a new thing now in Christianity
[45:10] is all these scholars coming up studying
[45:12] the historical records. And every time
[45:15] you, like I always say, you kick a bush
[45:17] and another historian pops out and
[45:19] another expert pops out on the Bible and
[45:22] now and then you get this guy who
[45:24] refutes that guy and now the internet is
[45:26] filled with all these guys refuting each
[45:28] other AND THIS ONE DESTROYS this one,
[45:32] right? You know, with the glasses on.
[45:35] Yeah. He destroys THEM. THIS ONE
[45:37] DESTROYS THIS ONE AND THIS ONE DESTROYS
[45:39] this one. Who's telling us the truth?
[45:42] who has the better knowledge of the
[45:43] recorded history. Now we have to prove
[45:46] which scrolls are authentic, what that
[45:48] writing says, who interpreted that
[45:50] writing and and transcribed into this
[45:52] one and what year this happened. And we
[45:55] can sit there for two hours and listen
[45:56] to these guys discussing about which
[45:59] year and what was done here and there.
[46:01] And when you're done with it, nobody
[46:03] knows what to believe.
[46:05] They have a vote. You know, like how
[46:07] many of you here in the audience believe
[46:09] in this guy and how many believe that
[46:11] this guy's argument was better and then
[46:13] they have these this like poll number
[46:15] that comes out. You know, the majority
[46:16] 80% believe this guy. What then?
[46:18] Therefore, he must be telling the truth
[46:21] because 80%.
[46:25] No, not even madeup philosophies, but by
[46:29] the correct understanding
[46:31] brought only by faith in the revelation
[46:35] of God for your day. That's the only
[46:38] truth there can be.
[46:41] Okay, let's get a little bit more into
[46:42] that. You love him, saints.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; It was then revealed to us that the Lord
[46:46] Jesus was that spirit of God made flesh.
[46:53] That's what the Bible then tells us,
[46:55] right? Which was called the son. That is
[46:58] the son. The same spirit of God made
[47:00] flesh is called the son. So here's my
[47:03] question for all you geniuses,
[47:07] right? Who've been following
[47:09] Christianity and the message for so
[47:12] long.
[47:14] What is a spirit?
[47:21] Can anyone sitting here with red blood
[47:24] and gray cells upstairs, I hope, explain
[47:27] to me in plain English, what is a
[47:30] spirit?
[47:33] Use some intellectual articulation
[47:37] to tell me what a spirit is.
[47:44] Oh, but we say amen. WORSHIP HIM IN
[47:46] SPIRIT, BROTHER.
[47:49] WHAT IS A SPIRIT?
[47:51] H we can barely explain it.
[47:55] Try it. I did. Gets me nowhere. For some
[48:00] reason, we have just accepted it as
[48:03] being something real. And some of us
[48:05] even have an imagination of it. I I
[48:07] guarantee you if I ask the children,
[48:09] they'll start giving me answers like
[48:11] this. You older people will fumble
[48:14] because you don't want to be wrong.
[48:15] Children will tell you. Spirit is like
[48:17] if I ask the children what color is a
[48:19] spirit it'll be white like a mist be
[48:22] like LIKE LIKE SMOKE INSIDE A PERSON
[48:25] THEY'LL COME UP WITH ANSWERS THEY'LL
[48:27] TELL exactly what they think that's what
[48:30] children do but you and I will be very
[48:33] reserved to say because we don't want to
[48:35] be wrong
[48:37] right but nobody I know can tell us
[48:40] exactly what it is and neither can I the
[48:43] word spirit can be used in many this
[48:46] This is amazing, right? This this one
[48:48] word we have no idea of is the one word
[48:51] running right through from the beginning
[48:52] from Genesis to Revelation. WE JUST AND
[48:55] THIS IS WHAT WE DO AS CHRISTIANS. WE'VE
[48:56] GOT THESE WORDS there and we just
[49:00] skirt around it. We don't want to talk
[49:02] about what it is, right? The word spirit
[49:05] can be used in many context and does not
[49:08] mean the same thing at every time.
[49:11] Right? Like the spirit that is God is
[49:15] not the same as being in the spirit.
[49:19] And this is like you know from the
[49:22] debacle of Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit
[49:27] you know that that that we just went
[49:29] through I went through it's like you
[49:32] would never say uh because it's the
[49:35] selfsame word now right you can never
[49:37] say in book of revelations John was in
[49:40] the ghost on the Lord's day
[49:45] you can't say that but they're the
[49:47] selfsame
[49:49] How was John in the ghost? You would
[49:51] never say that. It just doesn't mean the
[49:53] same thing. And yet in the Greek, it's
[49:56] exactly the same word. Numa.
[49:59] And then the very English, I want to
[50:01] show you this. Do you see here the
[50:03] English translators wrote, "God is a
[50:06] spirit, capital S, and you must worship
[50:08] him in spirit, lowercase S."
[50:12] The translators thought they understood
[50:14] something, which is why they did all
[50:16] that. Even the words Holy Spirit in the
[50:18] in the Bible, they don't always use it
[50:21] with capital S. Even the word spirit
[50:24] whenever there's some reasoning behind
[50:26] when they transcribed it, they
[50:28] recognized this was a different meaning,
[50:30] but they only had one word to express it
[50:32] by.
[50:35] So God is not the spirit of God is not
[50:38] the same as being in the spirit. One is
[50:41] referring to one is referring to the
[50:44] very essence of his being and the other
[50:47] is referring to the anointing of his
[50:49] word.
[50:53] Right? Now God is a spirit. Therefore we
[50:57] have to worship him in spirit. Now I
[51:00] want to ask this question. How can we as
[51:03] humans who are limited by three
[51:06] dimensions of light, matter and time?
[51:08] How do we even submit to something we
[51:12] cannot see, you cannot hear, you cannot
[51:15] touch, and you cannot understand?
[51:17] How do we submit to it in truth if we
[51:20] cannot? How do we submit to God whom we
[51:24] cannot see, we cannot hear, we cannot
[51:26] touch, we cannot understand? It's
[51:28] literally impossible for a normal human
[51:31] to do. So for you to do that in some way
[51:35] by yourself, you have to create an image
[51:38] in your mind or an understanding to
[51:41] which you can say I would like to follow
[51:43] that understanding.
[51:45] That's the only way because you can't
[51:48] see the spirit of God. You can't touch
[51:50] it. You can't see it. You can't
[51:52] understand it. You can't hear it.
[51:56] Right? For generations
[52:00] uh this has happened. We will
[52:02] immediately though. So here's here's the
[52:04] thing. If I ask you to tell me what you
[52:08] think the spirit of God is, I ask you
[52:11] how many people are here. Probably about
[52:12] 100 people. I don't know. We'll come up
[52:14] with a hundred different descriptions.
[52:18] Right
[52:20] now, who's is right?
[52:23] Whose image whose imagination is the
[52:27] best?
[52:28] And it's not someone who can draw it
[52:30] better.
[52:31] Someone with a greater imagination can
[52:33] come up with something really creative
[52:35] but absolutely wrong.
[52:37] That's just how it is right now. So in
[52:40] other words, we will all make the
[52:42] mistake of imagining something in our
[52:44] personal imaginations which will then
[52:46] conflict with someone else's
[52:47] imagination. You agree? So for
[52:50] generations, we have been satisfied. We
[52:52] satisfied ourselves believing that God
[52:55] is some kind of spiritual being that
[52:58] lives outside of our planet from where
[53:02] he controls earth.
[53:05] Is that roundabout correct?
[53:08] Cuz where does God live?
[53:11] From all that we showed you, all those
[53:12] pictures. I just showed you three
[53:14] pictures. Okay, you with me? There are
[53:18] thousands probably millions on the
[53:20] internet uh that that pictures of God.
[53:24] Okay. So, do you believe that God lives
[53:27] here
[53:29] in this air?
[53:32] Am I slapping him right now?
[53:36] Does he live inside us in the ground
[53:40] above us? in the clouds, in space, in
[53:45] another galaxy.
[53:47] Does it contain his spirit? How big is
[53:50] his spirit? How small is his spirit?
[53:55] H so for generations, so whatever you
[53:59] you think you can come up with in your
[54:00] mind, that's what you're going to submit
[54:02] to. Right now, some of us believe he's
[54:06] this invisible spirit that he's so big.
[54:09] He's the creator of the universe.
[54:10] certainly cannot live within our
[54:12] atmosphere. His home must be beyond the
[54:14] clouds. And we've got scriptures to say
[54:16] that.
[54:19] We do not comprehend the abstract
[54:22] reality of the word spirit. That's the
[54:24] reason why none of us can explain it
[54:26] because you can't comprehend it.
[54:29] We don't know what its essence is. We
[54:31] don't know what it looks like. We don't
[54:33] know what a spirit looks like. We cannot
[54:34] even imagine its reality. We believe it
[54:37] exists because we believe that, wait for
[54:40] it, that we have a spirit.
[54:45] And that this life inside our bodies is
[54:48] our spirit. How many of you here believe
[54:50] you have a spirit? You can raise your
[54:53] hands.
[54:55] Huh? Or what? Do you have some battery
[54:58] life source stuck in your kidney
[54:59] somewhere? Like, do you have a spirit?
[55:02] And then when you die and you breathe
[55:04] your last breath
[55:06] [sighs]
[55:07] and the body dies and the spirit leaves
[55:11] and every one of you believes you have a
[55:13] spirit.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes. So what does your spirit look
[55:17] like?
[55:19] Where does your spirit reside? There's
[55:22] no air inside there. I hope so. What's
[55:26] it? It's moving through your
[55:27] bloodstream.
[55:29] Where does your spirit live? in a cavity
[55:31] in your heart or in your brain.
[55:34] Where where is the spirit? DESCRIBE IT.
[55:37] HOW DOES IT LEAVE YOUR BODY? IS YOUR
[55:39] This is why the Jewish people came up
[55:41] with that ru the spirit is the breath.
[55:46] So what? Every time you breathe in
[55:48] [snorts] and out, your spirit is like,
[55:53] huh? That's your spirit. Remember I told
[55:56] you why you say bless you when there's a
[55:58] sneeze. Huh? Chew. BECAUSE YOUR SPIRIT
[56:00] GOES OUT AND YOU GOT TO SAY BLESS YOU
[56:02] BEFORE THE DEVIL CATCHES IT. [snorts]
[56:05] Thank the Germans for that.
[56:10] That's the best thing they came up
[56:11] besides Mercedes-Benz.
[56:17] The closest we can do to understanding
[56:20] what a spirit is is something we call
[56:23] nature.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the closest thing in that
[56:29] God would therefore be the mysterious
[56:31] divine nature even though we cannot
[56:35] explain it. That's the only word we have
[56:37] that's closest right and we feel
[56:39] satisfied knowing at least that the
[56:42] spirit of something is the nature of it
[56:46] somehow. Are you with me? Amen.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; So we know there are so many places in
[56:50] the message where the proverb tells us
[56:52] that the soul is the nature of the
[56:54] spirit.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; Now here's that other word soul.
[56:59] Who knows what that is? So if you had to
[57:02] go into I don't know the dictionary or
[57:06] like most of us today maybe the internet
[57:08] and you searched up what spirit is.
[57:10] Don't do it now please listen to me. Or
[57:12] you or you look at soul and what soul is
[57:15] they tell you that soul is believed to
[57:17] be the eternal part of the human
[57:19] essence. And the spirit is kind of like
[57:21] the seat of emotions and desires and
[57:24] that kind of thing. Even that what does
[57:26] that mean? It's still abstract. It
[57:30] doesn't look like reality to us. Are you
[57:32] with me?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; It seems like soul and spirit are
[57:36] connected.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; So how do we know this? Because you look
[57:39] at Moses' tabernacle, the outer court is
[57:43] one room. That's like the body with the
[57:45] the brass altar, the brazen labor. And
[57:47] then you go in and then there's one room
[57:51] with a veil. So the the spirit is like
[57:55] the inner court where the seven golden
[57:57] candlesticks, the table of showbread,
[57:58] the altar of incense, and you go behind
[58:00] the veil and there is the ark of the
[58:02] covenant with the shikina presence of
[58:04] God. And that would be the soul, right?
[58:07] But then it's one room. If you remove
[58:10] the veil, the two rooms become one room.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; Soul and spirit are actually one.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; So the nature of the spirit is actually
[58:20] from the soul. And the spirit takes the
[58:23] nature and transmits the nature to the
[58:26] rest of the body.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Whatever nature is in there is what
[58:31] sanctifies the body. Whatever nature is
[58:34] in there is what makes what is sanctify
[58:36] to make holy to consecrate. In other
[58:38] words, the spirit takes the nature from
[58:41] the soul and makes the body work for the
[58:44] soul
[58:45] &gt;&gt; for the nature that governs it.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[58:48] &gt;&gt; that's how it works,
[58:51] right? So somehow the spirit is
[58:53] something that pulls from the source of
[58:56] the nature that is inside to make the
[58:59] body do what its nature defines. Are you
[59:03] with me?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; So
[59:06] if you speak in a certain way, where's
[59:09] that coming from?
[59:12] A nature that's been put inside.
[59:14] Right? If you speak like an intellectual
[59:17] person, it means you've been feeding
[59:19] your soul with intellectualism,
[59:22] with education. If you speak like a
[59:24] gangster, well, there's no mystery where
[59:27] you got your education from,
[59:30] right?
[59:32] Because you want to be cool. went to cap
[59:34] worn backwards, your pants hanging down,
[59:37] socks with holes, pants with holes,
[59:39] t-shirts with all kinds of
[59:40] paraphernalia, hook here, ring there,
[59:43] tattoo this way, hair shaved off this
[59:45] side, and and and you stand next to
[59:48] someone who's a professor of, I don't
[59:49] know, philosophy, dressed in a
[59:51] three-piece suit, standing there with
[59:52] his checkered hat on and his bow tie.
[59:55] Two human beings,
[59:57] two different souls.
[1:00:00] The body's expression is what's inside
[1:00:02] the soul.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; The body is submitting to what nature is
[1:00:06] inside
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; this. You take the same person and you
[1:00:11] change the nature in the soul and the
[1:00:13] entire body adapts.
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; You take that same person with his pants
[1:00:18] hanging down, cap on backwards, smoking
[1:00:21] a cigarette, tattoos, all that stuff,
[1:00:23] rings here, poked there, speaking bad
[1:00:26] language and bring him to Christ. His
[1:00:28] nature changes. His body falls in line
[1:00:33] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS SPIRIT CONTACTS the nature
[1:00:35] and transmits it to the body and the
[1:00:38] body then takes the identification
[1:00:41] of the nature that is inside.
[1:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's as much as we can understand and
[1:00:46] we know this because and all humans know
[1:00:48] this. And some people I know
[1:00:50] philosophers right now will say you know
[1:00:52] they'll come at me with all this
[1:00:53] education and philosophy and say no this
[1:00:56] is not what it is. This is what it can.
[1:00:58] We know this because we literally do
[1:00:59] this to children.
[1:01:03] I mean, you come out all baby goooo gaga
[1:01:06] knowing nothing. Mama, dada, you know
[1:01:09] nothing. We take you at 5 years old,
[1:01:11] stick you in a school and brainwash you
[1:01:13] every day and teach you and put you
[1:01:16] through the pain of into holding a pen
[1:01:17] and teaching you to write. We inscribe
[1:01:19] it in your brain. We teach you education
[1:01:22] by association. We teach you the word
[1:01:24] cow and show you a picture. So we
[1:01:27] implant that picture in your head and
[1:01:29] the word in your head and now when you
[1:01:31] say cow you see it. How did we do it? We
[1:01:33] brainwashed you.
[1:01:35] We made you repeat it. We showed you
[1:01:37] place cards. Cow and is then for two.
[1:01:43] Mom, dad fish
[1:01:46] planting. Planting planting plant. We
[1:01:48] put it into you. That's why you can
[1:01:50] speak. That's why we can communicate
[1:01:52] with you. That's why you can read books.
[1:01:54] And it doesn't stop there because then
[1:01:56] we send you to high school where we
[1:01:58] indoctrinate you and brainwash you even
[1:02:00] more. Then we send you to university and
[1:02:02] then after you get to work then the job
[1:02:04] sends you somewhere. It doesn't stop
[1:02:07] till you old and retired and then you
[1:02:09] realize what in the world do I know
[1:02:11] about anything.
[1:02:15] H
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; let's dump all that and go fishing. You
[1:02:19] should have went fishing at the start,
[1:02:21] man. Yeah.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:27] A nature to us can only be defined as a
[1:02:30] set of characteristics or attributes
[1:02:34] that causes a being like you to behave
[1:02:37] in a certain way. Like you'll say that
[1:02:40] guy is a really honest person. That
[1:02:43] person is very aggressive. That guy is a
[1:02:45] liar. That guy is rude. That one is
[1:02:48] aggressive. That one is jealous. Why are
[1:02:51] you saying that? Because the way they're
[1:02:53] responding to life is identifying a
[1:02:57] certain nature that you know of.
[1:03:00] Right? So religions have taught us
[1:03:04] identifiable characteristics that define
[1:03:07] God according to them.
[1:03:11] The same way we identify humans. So if I
[1:03:14] ask you right now, can you describe the
[1:03:16] nature of God to me? And this is what
[1:03:18] religions have done. Humans have been
[1:03:20] made to believe that characteristics of
[1:03:23] God is being good, righteous, loving,
[1:03:28] kind, caring, wise, knowing all things,
[1:03:33] supernatural, and so much more. If you
[1:03:36] add judge, anger, they don't like that
[1:03:39] one.
[1:03:42] Judging the sin, they don't like that
[1:03:44] one, right? So God must be loving. Have
[1:03:47] you seen Christians today? bunch of
[1:03:49] wimps. God must be a love God of love.
[1:03:52] He's so accepting. He must accept
[1:03:54] everybody. You can only don't even read
[1:03:56] the Bible. You just come in here with
[1:03:58] your hair colored purple and your shorts
[1:04:00] on BACKWARDS AND DO WHATEVER YOU FEEL
[1:04:02] LIKE. GOD IS A GOD OF LOVE. Come in.
[1:04:05] That's God. That's lies.
[1:04:11] We have been told that if something does
[1:04:13] not match those identifiable
[1:04:15] characteristics and listen every church
[1:04:17] denomination has a certain set of
[1:04:19] characteristics that they say God is.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; God loves worship. So you get this one,
[1:04:25] some churches, the whole service is just
[1:04:27] drums, bass guitars, singing songs,
[1:04:30] craziness because God loves worship. And
[1:04:32] then they read a psalm and preach for 15
[1:04:35] minutes and they talk about politics and
[1:04:37] jokes. And that's the church. All right,
[1:04:39] see you. Don't forget to buy something
[1:04:40] at our coffee shop on your way out. God
[1:04:42] bless you. See you next week. Don't
[1:04:44] forget to pay your tithe and your money
[1:04:45] and your offerings. We're good to go.
[1:04:47] WE'LL SEE YOU IN HEAVEN SOMEDAY.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; That's church today. It's a joke. Yeah.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; And people cannot even listen to the
[1:04:56] word for 20 minutes.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; You say you believe in God but you can't
[1:05:02] hear his word.
[1:05:06] We have been told that if those
[1:05:08] identifiable characteristics if it
[1:05:11] doesn't match that it's not God. So
[1:05:13] every church, every religion has its
[1:05:15] idea of the identifiable
[1:05:17] characteristics.
[1:05:18] So we've what do we call it today? We
[1:05:21] call it godliness.
[1:05:23] Right? We have taught people that this
[1:05:25] is what God is. So we do this too. So
[1:05:28] you got people in the message. If you
[1:05:30] had the Holy Ghost, you wouldn't do
[1:05:32] that. If you had the Holy Ghost, you
[1:05:35] wouldn't talk like that. You wouldn't
[1:05:36] say this. You wouldn't act this way. You
[1:05:38] wouldn't really,
[1:05:42] you know, I just been through something
[1:05:44] this week.
[1:05:46] I just had a man who I don't know, he
[1:05:48] saw some Tik Tok video of me. And
[1:05:50] listen, I don't make the Tik Tok videos.
[1:05:52] I don't know who does.
[1:05:54] And they put these slogans on there
[1:05:56] which are not even my words. Like the
[1:05:58] one that was was there said uh it's it's
[1:06:01] a Tik Tok of me. They took it from a
[1:06:04] video and they put there that I said a
[1:06:06] prophet like no other. I didn't even say
[1:06:09] that.
[1:06:10] I was speaking about the prophet's
[1:06:12] ministry and I said his ministry was
[1:06:14] like no other prophet. And I explained
[1:06:16] that he went through two world wars and
[1:06:19] rock and roll and mass-produced drugs
[1:06:21] and alcohol. And then I came to the
[1:06:23] point where I said not even Jesus had to
[1:06:25] go through that.
[1:06:27] Kai told me I'm a blasphemer,
[1:06:30] right? And uh that I shouldn't even uh
[1:06:32] be doing I didn't even say what he's
[1:06:35] saying I was saying. Right?
[1:06:37] But and then he told me, um, you're a
[1:06:40] good minister, but you know, you, uh, I
[1:06:43] don't see the spirit of Christ in you in
[1:06:45] the way you speak. Like you, you
[1:06:47] shouldn't speak that way and mock
[1:06:49] somebody or laugh, you know, at the
[1:06:50] denominations like that. I said, "Uh,
[1:06:53] excuse me. If you heard Christ speak
[1:06:58] and if I had to speak like him, if I had
[1:07:00] to come out here and say denominations,
[1:07:02] you are hypocrites. You are vipers. You
[1:07:04] are asp. YOU ARE SNAKES IN THE GRASS.
[1:07:06] YOU ARE OF YOUR FATHER THE DEVIL.
[1:07:10] I have never even spoken like that." So,
[1:07:13] what's your idea of how Christ speaks?
[1:07:15] See, loving, kind, gentle,
[1:07:20] understanding, non-judgmental.
[1:07:25] That's God. God loves everyone.
[1:07:29] That already sounds to me like the CIA
[1:07:31] got a spotlight on me, you know, like uh
[1:07:35] uh brainwashing me for something.
[1:07:39] But then we found that evil people are
[1:07:42] able TO DISPLAY THESE CHARACTERISTICS AS
[1:07:44] WELL.
[1:07:45] AS ANY OTHER REGULAR PERSON,
[1:07:49] psychopaths
[1:07:51] can be very kind, loving, gentle until
[1:07:54] they kill you.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; IF NATURES WERE SO EASILY DISCERNABLE,
[1:08:01] then every person ought to with ease be
[1:08:05] able to tell what is the difference
[1:08:06] between God and the devil.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Why? Why are more humans not able? There
[1:08:12] are people who worshiping God but don't
[1:08:14] realize they're worshiping the devil.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:19] [clears throat]
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; So unfortunately the truth is it's not
[1:08:23] that easily discernable anymore. It
[1:08:25] should have been but we've done things
[1:08:27] to ourselves that make it impossible for
[1:08:30] us to even discern good and evil.
[1:08:34] So what is the most Are you with me?
[1:08:37] What is the most explicitly
[1:08:41] identifiable characteristic
[1:08:44] about the spirit of God that we can
[1:08:47] identify can only be God
[1:08:52] truth?
[1:08:55] Some people will say God is love because
[1:08:58] you see it in John. God is love and
[1:09:00] those who have love one another and so
[1:09:02] on. But even love is found in truth
[1:09:05] &gt;&gt; because love is perverted
[1:09:08] in today's world. You can pervert love
[1:09:10] into a whole lot of things. And even
[1:09:11] when they say God is love, what kind of
[1:09:13] love are you talking about?
[1:09:16] Because according to God's love, he'll
[1:09:18] chastise you when you're wrong. And when
[1:09:21] he chastises, chastises and gives you a
[1:09:23] weapon. Then you must accept it because
[1:09:25] you know that he loves you, right?
[1:09:29] Nobody wants that love, right? So the
[1:09:32] only identifiable characteristic that
[1:09:35] absolutely identifies the spirit of God
[1:09:38] is truth.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Because in him is truth and is no lie.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; All right, let's quickly go through it.
[1:09:46] Are you ready? The spirit of truth.
[1:09:49] That's what we speaking about. Okay,
[1:09:50] here's scripture. In hope of eternal
[1:09:52] life, which God that cannot lie
[1:09:57] promised the world promised before the
[1:09:59] world began. Here's scripture telling
[1:10:01] you God cannot lie.
[1:10:04] That's his identifiable characteristic.
[1:10:07] Uh the second one, that by two immutable
[1:10:09] things in which it is impossible for God
[1:10:12] to lie, we might have a strong
[1:10:14] consolation who have fled for refuge to
[1:10:17] lay hold upon the hope set before us. It
[1:10:19] is impossible for God to lie. Agreed.
[1:10:24] uh John 14:17, even the spirit of truth
[1:10:28] whom the world cannot receive is is
[1:10:31] telling you the world does not even
[1:10:33] receive the spirit of truth. The nature
[1:10:35] of truth
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; because it seeth him not means it
[1:10:39] doesn't understand him. It neither know
[1:10:41] but you know him for he dwelleth with
[1:10:44] you and shall be in you.
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; We did that recently, right? Last week
[1:10:51] with you and shall be in you.
[1:10:54] John 15:26, "When the comforter is come,
[1:10:56] whom I will send unto you from the
[1:10:58] father, even the spirit of truth which
[1:11:01] proceedth, it comes FROM GOD HIMSELF."
[1:11:03] THE HOLY SPIRIT, THE spirit of truth, it
[1:11:05] it it comes OUT FROM HIS VERY OWN
[1:11:08] NATURE.
[1:11:09] The Holy Spirit cannot speak a lie.
[1:11:13] The Holy Spirit cannot do something with
[1:11:15] people that produces a lie. The Holy
[1:11:18] Spirit cannot speak with tongues and
[1:11:19] that message is a lie. The Holy Spirit
[1:11:22] cannot preach a sermon and the sermon
[1:11:24] has a lie in it.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:32] Uh how be it when he the spirit of truth
[1:11:35] is come, he will guide you in all truth.
[1:11:38] This again speaking of the of the Holy
[1:11:39] Spirit. 1 John 4:6, we are of God. He
[1:11:43] that knoweth God heareth us. That means
[1:11:47] only those people who are also of God
[1:11:49] will be able to understand what we say
[1:11:52] and believe what we say. He that is not
[1:11:54] of God heareth not us. That's telling us
[1:11:57] he that is not of the truth cannot
[1:12:00] understand what we say. Hereby we know.
[1:12:03] THIS IS HOW WE KNOW THE SPIRIT of truth
[1:12:05] and the spirit of error.
[1:12:07] Do you want you must take these
[1:12:09] scriptures go back home and and study it
[1:12:11] out. Break it out. This is how we
[1:12:14] discern the spirit of truth and the
[1:12:15] spirit of error because we know if you
[1:12:19] are of God you will understand us. How
[1:12:22] in in other words, let me say it this
[1:12:24] way. How do I know that you love me?
[1:12:28] This is how simple it is. Because when I
[1:12:30] tell you something, you believe me.
[1:12:34] That's the hardest thing to say.
[1:12:36] Remember I preached recently
[1:12:38] um well few years ago to love someone
[1:12:42] means to believe in them.
[1:12:45] So if I tell you something and you look
[1:12:48] at me like nah I don't think so right
[1:12:51] like h no I don't think you're telling
[1:12:53] me the truth you don't believe me that
[1:12:56] proves you don't completely love me you
[1:12:58] may have an idea of me this is this is
[1:13:01] what marriage should be this is what it
[1:13:03] should be between parents and children
[1:13:06] th this is what life should be where if
[1:13:08] you truly love someone you believe what
[1:13:10] they say like you don't have to I don't
[1:13:14] want to go back to that washing basket
[1:13:15] and the clothes, but go around and prove
[1:13:19] whether they told you the truth because
[1:13:22] FAITH MAKES YOU ACT ON WHAT YOU BELIEVE.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; See John 14:6
[1:13:30] uh to 10 Jesus said unto him, "I am the
[1:13:33] way." Jesus now is saying, "I am the
[1:13:37] way, the truth, and the life." Right?
[1:13:41] God is the is the spirit of truth. Is
[1:13:44] [clears throat] that right? God is a
[1:13:46] spirit. When he, the spirit of truth,
[1:13:47] has come. And now Jesus IS SAYING, "I AM
[1:13:50] the way. I am the truth. I am the life."
[1:13:53] No man comes to God but by me.
[1:13:58] You will not even get to worship God
[1:14:01] unless you come through me. What does
[1:14:04] that mean? That's his words. What does
[1:14:06] IT MEAN? YOU HAVE to receive the truth.
[1:14:08] And how did he say you shall receive the
[1:14:10] truth? My word is truth.
[1:14:13] Right? If you have known me, you should
[1:14:16] have known God the Father. From
[1:14:18] henceforth we know him and have seen
[1:14:20] him. From now on, from now on, he's
[1:14:22] telling the disciples, you have known
[1:14:24] him and have seen him. Who was he
[1:14:26] talking about? Himself. Philip said unto
[1:14:29] him, Lord, show us the Father. What
[1:14:30] happened to Philip? Did you just doze
[1:14:32] off just now? Right. Uh, show us the
[1:14:35] Father, Lord, and suffice it. And Jesus
[1:14:37] said unto him, "Have I been with you so
[1:14:38] long and just and yet hast thou not
[1:14:41] known me, Philillip?" He had he that had
[1:14:44] seen me hath seen the father. If you
[1:14:46] seen me, if you understood me, if you
[1:14:48] know me, THEN YOU KNOW GOD. HOW SAYEST
[1:14:51] THOU SHOW US THE FATHER? Believest thou
[1:14:54] not that I am in the father, and the
[1:14:56] father in me. The words that I speak are
[1:14:58] not of myself, but the father that
[1:15:00] dwelleth in me, he doeth the works. All
[1:15:02] right. So, I'm going to close this off
[1:15:03] quickly and get to the next part.
[1:15:06] So these are just a few scriptures
[1:15:08] saints among many that show us that if
[1:15:10] there is anything that can describe who
[1:15:13] God is today, it is that word that
[1:15:16] fiveletter word truth
[1:15:20] which is so scarce today.
[1:15:23] Therefore who God really is to us in the
[1:15:26] world is the spirit of truth. Right?
[1:15:29] Sunday school kids listening
[1:15:32] truth. Remember sister Lena told you
[1:15:35] every time you want to do something
[1:15:37] there's that good voice and that naughty
[1:15:38] voice.
[1:15:40] Hey young people,
[1:15:43] you always know you don't need mommy,
[1:15:45] you don't need daddy, you don't need
[1:15:47] when there's your friend tells you to do
[1:15:49] something, there's a voice that's
[1:15:50] telling you I shouldn't do this and
[1:15:52] there's the other voice saying, "Yeah,
[1:15:54] do it, MAN. DO IT. YOU WANT TO?" AND THE
[1:15:58] OTHER ONE is saying, "Don't do it. It's
[1:15:59] not right." One is telling you truth.
[1:16:02] The other one is telling you a lie.
[1:16:06] And the spirit of God is
[1:16:08] truth.
[1:16:10] Okay, so here's the beauty part of this.
[1:16:15] Would we even have a word for truth if
[1:16:17] there were no lies introduced?
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Okay, so if there was no such thing as
[1:16:25] untruth or lies or error, we wouldn't
[1:16:28] even have to define truth. We would just
[1:16:31] know it and live with it and it's fine.
[1:16:33] Because this world is so overcome with
[1:16:35] lies and error, it is why truth has
[1:16:38] become so outstanding today. Okay, now
[1:16:41] we're getting to the next part which is
[1:16:43] quite interesting. So before we get to
[1:16:45] that which is who is the devil?
[1:16:50] All right, it's amazing whenever I do
[1:16:52] this subject this is when people wake
[1:16:54] up.
[1:16:56] I went through God and some of them are
[1:16:57] yawning and tired. But when you talk
[1:16:59] about the devil, it's like [snorts] I
[1:17:02] need to know this coffee,
[1:17:06] right? I'm just making light of it. I
[1:17:09] want you to get this before we go into
[1:17:12] this uh next part.
[1:17:15] This entire world right now is in a very
[1:17:19] sorry state. I I don't want to spend too
[1:17:21] much of time trying to describe how bad
[1:17:23] it is. Okay. Um, and I don't want to
[1:17:28] hurt anybody's feelings,
[1:17:34] but if you had to go to schools today
[1:17:37] and uh or anywhere,
[1:17:40] you are finding like at least 50% of any
[1:17:43] class with children whose parents are
[1:17:45] divorced
[1:17:47] or they hate their parents or they're
[1:17:50] having just troubles. It's like you you
[1:17:53] cannot believe what little kids have to
[1:17:55] go through today. Uh going through life
[1:17:57] without parents, without uh fathers who
[1:18:00] care for the mothers and mothers who are
[1:18:01] cheating on the fathers or something.
[1:18:03] This is what life is becoming. And and
[1:18:05] the reason for everything from families
[1:18:08] to to children to societies breaking
[1:18:12] down into absolute evil is because there
[1:18:16] is no truth anymore being spoken.
[1:18:21] Right? And and and what is it? It is the
[1:18:25] devil.
[1:18:26] [snorts]
