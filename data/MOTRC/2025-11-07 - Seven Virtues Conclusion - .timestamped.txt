[0:01] When people look at these seven virtues
[0:03] and this is why I'm I want to show you
[0:05] in closing conclude this this out is
[0:08] that people who thought that this is the
[0:10] seven thunders and these were seven
[0:13] mysteries seven so mysterious things
[0:15] faith virtue knowledge temp they're so
[0:18] mysterious they had to be spoken by the
[0:19] thunders and why it's wrong is because
[0:24] these are not natures of God
[0:28] &gt;&gt; they are the original nature of man.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; That was corrupted and have to be
[0:34] restored before the capstone descends on
[0:38] you.
[0:40] &gt;&gt; In other words, had there been no sin,
[0:43] you would have possessed them
[0:45] &gt;&gt; in whatever was necessary.
[0:47] &gt;&gt; Right? So, what is faith? This isn't the
[0:51] faith of God that framed the worlds.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; Everybody has faith.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, some of you people with
[0:59] anxiety, you also have faith. Maybe a
[1:01] little, but you have some,
[1:06] right? You trust in your anxiousness.
[1:09] You have faith in your anxiety to keep
[1:11] you safe.
[1:13] &gt;&gt; That's still faith. Faith is is a is
[1:16] something that men have, men and women
[1:18] have to make them believe in something
[1:21] without evidence.
[1:24] All of you do that. All of you use that.
[1:25] All of you exercise that. Am I right?
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; And it's in everything you do, you
[1:33] exercise a little bit of faith. Not one
[1:35] of you will say to me, "Well, I was sick
[1:38] and there was this cough mixture and I
[1:41] spent a whole year studying it before I
[1:44] bought it."
[1:47] Nobody. You will hear, you will call a
[1:50] friend, you will call a relative, you
[1:51] will listen to the doctor. You hear what
[1:52] the doctor says. You will even make the
[1:55] stupid decision based on how the doctor
[1:57] smiled.
[1:59] Amen.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; And the doctor said, "Don't worry. Trust
[2:01] me. I've been a doctor for 50 years.
[2:04] This works." And you'll be like looking
[2:06] at your husband 50 years. He must know
[2:09] what he's talking about.
[2:11] Let's buy it based on that
[2:14] or this one or I saw this on YouTube. I
[2:17] saw this on Tik Tok or that or that.
[2:19] Please do not tell me you've done due
[2:21] diligence and done all the
[2:23] investigations necessary. At some point
[2:26] your investigations ran out and you took
[2:28] it by faith,
[2:32] &gt;&gt; right? Everybody, every human acts
[2:35] majority of the time on faith
[2:38] &gt;&gt; because nobody has the time to go find
[2:40] all the evidence.
[2:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not faith, it's just
[2:45] hoping.
[2:47] Let's take it and hope it works. Right?
[2:51] The point is there are natures of man
[2:54] that has been corrupted.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:57] &gt;&gt; Even faith itself is corrupted
[3:00] &gt;&gt; because faith in the wrong thing is
[3:03] corrupt faith.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; Like people who will actually trust in a
[3:08] lie and stake their claim on a lie.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; They have had corrupted faith. They were
[3:14] unable to see through the lie and
[3:17] recognize that they need to to change
[3:19] their idea about this. Right? So all
[3:22] those attributes they are attributes of
[3:25] man.
[3:26] Virtue is an attribute of man. Knowledge
[3:28] is an attribute of man. Temperance is an
[3:31] attribute of man.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Why does God need temperance?
[3:36] Temperance is self-control.
[3:40] Why is that a godly attribute?
[3:42] Self-control. Does God ever need
[3:44] self-control?
[3:46] Does God ever need patience?
[3:50] H
[3:51] Does God need to exercise patience? Come
[3:53] on, people. Is time affecting God? Oh, I
[3:57] need to endure.
[3:59] Does God need to endure?
[4:02] How about godliness? Does God need
[4:04] godliness?
[4:08] Huh? This is the this is the thing. So
[4:10] when we say they are attributes of the
[4:12] Holy Spirit or something like that, THE
[4:14] HOLY SPIRIT AGAIN IS SOMETHING RELATED
[4:16] to man.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:19] &gt;&gt; See, so first before we get to the
[4:22] actual divine attribute meant to cap
[4:27] mankind, you have to have all those
[4:30] other attributes restored to its
[4:33] original.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; That's what the building blocks are
[4:37] about. We've got to have true faith in
[4:40] the right thing. How could you have
[4:43] faith unless Christ was born, died, and
[4:48] rose again? How could you have faith
[4:50] toward true righteousness unless God
[4:53] became a man and showed you what true
[4:55] faith is?
[4:56] &gt;&gt; How could you have faith in a word
[4:59] unless that word was tested?
[5:03] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So, here's what
[5:05] happened. In the garden of Eden, man was
[5:08] once divine
[5:10] in the flesh. He was divine. He had the
[5:14] nature that was fit to rule.
[5:17] This is important to understand which
[5:20] will tell us why they are not the seven
[5:22] thunders. They are divine human natures,
[5:27] not the celestial nature of God. Trust
[5:30] me, when we get through each one, like
[5:32] brother said, we'll take faith, virtue,
[5:33] knowledge, temperance, patience. We'll
[5:35] get through each one. We'll study it out
[5:37] and then you can decide and tell me
[5:39] whether this is like a nature of God.
[5:42] Can you if he says add to your faith
[5:45] everyone starts there faith right? When
[5:48] you start off do you have the faith of
[5:50] God that framed the worlds
[5:54] do you? And at what point do you get it
[5:57] and then add to your faith virtue?
[6:01] None of us ever have the faith to create
[6:03] a planet.
[6:07] &gt;&gt; So that's not the faith you're looking
[6:08] to.
[6:10] &gt;&gt; I mean, you're barely struggling to have
[6:12] faith to create an outbuilding at the
[6:14] back of your house
[6:16] or a dog kennel
[6:19] nailed up perfectly at 90° angles
[6:22] or some kind of thing that you're
[6:24] creating at home. Not enough faith. Is
[6:28] that right? You know, I tell my kids,
[6:30] "Poor human society." I tell you, we got
[6:33] to We constantly have to reward
[6:34] ourselves with food. You know, uh, you
[6:38] know, I I bought the kennel, honey, I'm
[6:40] going to build a kennel. Because I
[6:42] bought it, I need to reward myself with
[6:44] food. Let's go have some cheesecake. You
[6:47] know, then I get through like quarter of
[6:50] it. Look how well I did. Let's have some
[6:52] more cheesecake
[6:54] cuz I'm doing so well. rewarding myself,
[6:57] giving myself some dopamine. Then I I
[7:00] finish the thing, but it's slightly
[7:02] skewed. Don't worry, honey. We still
[7:03] tried. Let's go have some cheesecake.
[7:05] [laughter]
[7:08] Hey, we've got to reward ourselves. No
[7:10] matter how good or bad we do,
[7:13] no matter what or how how things go, we
[7:15] must still reward ourselves. This is
[7:18] human nature. It's all messed up, right?
[7:21] This is important, saints. They are
[7:23] divine natures of human beings. God
[7:27] doesn't need godliness, patience or
[7:29] temperance.
[7:32] He is perfect. He is not part of time.
[7:36] &gt;&gt; He does not have to endure anything. He
[7:39] does not need to exercise patience. If
[7:42] if God became impatient with us, there's
[7:44] something wrong with him. Cuz how could
[7:47] he be impatient when he already knows we
[7:50] were going to do that?
[7:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:52] He's he's got fornowledge. So how can he
[7:54] have impatience?
[7:56] True.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; His endurance with us is not about his
[8:02] endurance. It's about our It's about his
[8:04] longsuffering because we are so
[8:06] complacent,
[8:09] right? God respects your choice. As a
[8:13] church, we are only safe and ready to
[8:16] completely destroy the enemy in the
[8:19] presence of our husband, Christ. In
[8:22] Eden, the woman fell in the absence of
[8:24] her capstone.
[8:27] &gt;&gt; She fell in the absence of her husband.
[8:31] &gt;&gt; So if you don't if you DON'T EVEN GET
[8:34] CAPPED with that capstone, all that you
[8:36] built up, you will still fall by.
[8:40] &gt;&gt; That's how we know it's not the seven
[8:42] thunders.
[8:42] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[8:45] &gt;&gt; Because she had everything. She even had
[8:48] contact with the theophony. But in the
[8:50] absence of her husband, she was wooed by
[8:52] a different capstone that corrupted
[8:55] whatever nature she had and took it out,
[8:57] stripped it away from her.
[9:00] Which is why though you are built up by
[9:03] all the word of the messengers, the Holy
[9:05] Spirit has to seal that in and the
[9:07] capstone come on to perfect it. And now
[9:09] it's sealed in place.
[9:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:13] &gt;&gt; That's why we are living in the day when
[9:15] the capstone has to descend. That's what
[9:17] the seven seal must do. Yes,
[9:19] &gt;&gt; it must become something personal to you
[9:21] that brings the capsule down, connects
[9:23] you to your husband. When he is present,
[9:26] then the virtue of God himself is
[9:29] produced in us. Divine agape love. But
[9:32] it is important that we go through the
[9:34] entire building process. Saints,
[9:38] to close us off, you couldn't have come
[9:41] out of Egypt, crossed over the Red Sea,
[9:44] and start having a revival that you were
[9:46] in the promised land. Yeah,
[9:47] &gt;&gt; you couldn't. You had to walk through
[9:49] the wilderness journey. You had to meet
[9:52] every step. You had to meet Kora Day.
[9:54] You had to meet uh the the waters of
[9:56] Mara. You had to go through the the
[9:58] quailes issue. You had to go through all
[10:00] the trials before you get to the place
[10:02] where you get into the promised land.
[10:04] You can't stop there and say, "Now I'm
[10:06] ready for the seventh seal to be open."
[10:08] That's why it's not even a global
[10:10] instantaneous happening. Each one of us
[10:13] are going through our steps,
[10:15] &gt;&gt; our own personal growth.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; And at that time, YOU CAN BE SITTING in
[10:20] the same church under our ministry. And
[10:23] I was preaching the seven seal 20 years
[10:25] ago. It doesn't mean because I preached
[10:27] it 20 years ago, you've got it.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; You still have to come through your
[10:31] personal growth UNTIL THAT WHICH I
[10:33] PREACHED 20 YEARS AGO becomes a reality
[10:35] to you.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not bringing messages to
[10:39] tell you you're you're slowing us down.
[10:42] You're not worth it. You're getting into
[10:43] slow. You're not getting into No. If we
[10:46] preach like that, it means we don't even
[10:47] understand what we're preaching.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; Everybody is growing according to how
[10:53] God is revealing himself to them.
[10:56] &gt;&gt; You don't ever have to worry about being
[10:58] behind someone
[10:59] &gt;&gt; or you only came into the message a few
[11:01] years ago. Trust me, we're not going
[11:03] anywhere without you.
[11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a beautiful part of this
[11:07] thing. I I often hear brothers, you
[11:10] know, tell me, wonderful, sincere
[11:11] brothers, ministers saying, you know,
[11:14] brother, how do we catch up? I don't
[11:18] even think of you having to catch up.
[11:20] What do what do you have to catch up
[11:22] with? How much we know or how we can
[11:24] teach something? All you have to do is
[11:26] listen, believe, and trust God.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT AND ACT on it.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:34] You don't have to do anything. It'll
[11:37] testify for itself.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; He'll let it be known among men. Just
[11:42] let it become real to you. Listen to the
[11:44] word, believe it, and act on it.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; I think that's where the church fails. I
[11:50] I've actually got quotes that I've,
[11:52] &gt;&gt; you know, going, Brother Man says,
[11:54] people believe. I think we read some of
[11:55] it on on Wednesday. People believe and
[11:59] stop there. Yeah,
[12:01] &gt;&gt; that's the issue right now with the
[12:03] right now with message churches. That's
[12:04] the issue because we preach the word, we
[12:07] take you to camps, you get the Holy
[12:09] Ghost, and then we bring you to church
[12:11] and and you do nothing.
[12:13] &gt;&gt; You're never meant to do nothing.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; You have to act on the word
[12:18] &gt;&gt; because that is going to produce the
[12:20] virtue. The virtue that's going to lead
[12:22] you to the building blocks that builds
[12:24] you up to become that holy temple which
[12:26] he can cap. These are seven steps to
[12:28] perfection. Then he seals everything
[12:30] with the Holy Ghost at the end and
[12:32] brings his own divine nature, celestial
[12:36] heavenly divine nature which is the
[12:38] capstone to come down upon. Praise be to
[12:41] God. Let's bow our heads together. Amen.
