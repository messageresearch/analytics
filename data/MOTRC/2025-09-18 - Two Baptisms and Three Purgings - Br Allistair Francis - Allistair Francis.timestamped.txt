[0:01] Amen. God bless you saints. While you're
[0:03] standing, we would like to read two two
[0:06] portions of scripture from Matthew chap
[0:08] 11
[0:10] and uh verse
[0:13] vers uh Matthew chapter 3 11-12
[0:17] and also Ephesians 5 25- 27.
[0:23] So Matthew 3:11-12
[0:27] is John the Baptist speaking and he
[0:29] says,"I indeed baptize you with water
[0:33] unto repentance, but he that cometh
[0:36] after me is mightier than I, whose shoes
[0:39] I am not worthy to bear, he shall
[0:42] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[0:44] fire, whose fan is in his hand, and he
[0:49] will thoroughly purge his floor and
[0:52] gather his wheat eat into the garner,
[0:54] but he will burn up the chaff with
[0:56] unquenchable fire.
[0:59] Ephesians 5:25-27.
[1:02] This is Paul saying, "Husbands,
[1:06] love your wives even as Christ also
[1:08] loved the church and gave himself for
[1:10] it, that he might sanctify
[1:15] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[1:18] by the word, that he might present it to
[1:21] himself a glorious church, not having
[1:24] spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but
[1:27] that it should be holy and without
[1:30] blemish." Amen. Amen. The Lord add a
[1:32] blessing to his word. You may be seated.
[1:34] We like to greet you in the glorious
[1:36] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:38] Christ. Certainly good to be with you uh
[1:40] this morning and to share the word of
[1:42] the Lord with you. We like to uh it
[1:45] seems we have a lot of um uh September
[1:48] babies in our church. Uh so we had u
[1:53] Joshua's birthday uh last week. We had
[1:56] um
[1:58] um Sister Rose and Sister Mercy. We had
[2:00] Sister Alicia,
[2:02] uh, Sister Cindy Ba, uh, Brother Ellen.
[2:06] I'm not sure if I missed anybody else
[2:07] out, but uh, there seems to be I'm not
[2:10] sure are these all Virgos or or Libra
[2:13] people, but um, God bless you, and we
[2:16] wish you all, um, eternal life.
[2:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23] So uh happy to have brother Joseph here
[2:26] with us from Cape Town and uh um
[2:30] somebody we know. So the Lord bless you
[2:31] and any other visitors among us. The
[2:33] Lord be with you and bless you this
[2:36] morning. So I'm I'm certainly thankful
[2:38] to be um sharing the word of God with
[2:41] you this morning. It's uh it's uh been a
[2:44] special uh time. I cannot tell you
[2:49] um what it feels like and what is what
[2:52] it feels like what is going on right now
[2:54] in the world. And I know this um this
[2:58] week this entire world has been rocked
[3:00] by the assassination of this young man
[3:03] Charlie Kirk from the United States and
[3:06] I was just uh watching the world go by
[3:10] and like there's a lot of people in
[3:12] South Africa who just don't care about
[3:14] it, some who don't know. There are those
[3:16] who listen to a certain type of media
[3:19] who are totally shocked by it and those
[3:21] who listen to a different type of media
[3:23] who really don't care at all and there
[3:25] are people who just are not interested
[3:28] but the world seems to be focusing
[3:31] around something
[3:33] and uh it's it's kind of shocking to me
[3:36] that in places like the United States
[3:38] and Western world it's it's almost there
[3:42] it's it's almost like um uh as if Jesus
[3:46] Christ died
[3:48] &gt;&gt; to a lot of people and uh and in the
[3:51] same way I mean it's just it's just a
[3:53] man
[3:54] &gt;&gt; and um the the amount of tributes and
[3:57] the the the big deal people make about
[4:00] and it is I mean it's a big deal for
[4:02] anyone to lose their life and to be
[4:04] assassinated
[4:06] and I think of uh you know the American
[4:08] government in the western world how they
[4:10] criticize us and we are barbarians and
[4:13] we are savages and there's people being
[4:15] killed in our streets and of course we
[4:17] we gotten so used to it. You know,
[4:20] somebody gets assassinated in in our
[4:22] country. It's like, yeah, it's just
[4:26] another one, you know. It's it's it's
[4:28] like that. But we get called savages
[4:31] and, you know, stabbings in our
[4:33] universities and things with knives and
[4:35] whatever, but you don't get anyone taken
[4:37] out by a long gun in our country. You've
[4:41] got the most sophisticated people, the
[4:43] most intellectual people. You've got the
[4:45] most they're they're they're happy
[4:48] people. They're wealthy people. They
[4:50] they've got this fantastic country with
[4:51] this fantastic life. And you get a kid
[4:55] taking out somebody
[4:57] &gt;&gt; with a long gun with a sniper rifle.
[5:00] It's crazy,
[5:02] &gt;&gt; you know. And uh so it doesn't matter
[5:05] how rich and sophisticated and educated
[5:07] you are, they're all savages.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. It just goes to prove what's in
[5:11] your heart is what you are going to be.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; And that no matter who you are and what
[5:16] you say, if you don't have the Holy
[5:18] Spirit, like the prophet says, you're
[5:20] just a beast.
[5:22] &gt;&gt; And uh that's, you know, I just I just
[5:25] think, you know, as Christians, don't
[5:27] get caught up in all these
[5:29] conversations.
[5:30] Uh I I mean, you can obviously have the
[5:33] conversations, but don't pick sides with
[5:35] the world.
[5:37] uh in the end they'll all stab you in
[5:39] the back because you are actually the
[5:41] people who are the embodiment of Christ
[5:44] &gt;&gt; in this world. We know the antichrist
[5:46] comes from within Christianity.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; So you can fight for Christians against
[5:52] another religion or something. It'll be
[5:53] the same Christians that stab you in the
[5:55] back. That's how it is. Believe me in
[5:58] the message it's no different. You you
[6:00] will not believe how much of persecution
[6:03] we are taking right now and people
[6:06] trying to silence us for the things that
[6:08] we preach. It's I don't even care to
[6:10] share it with you but it's on a daily
[6:12] basis and uh you wouldn't believe the
[6:14] things that are spoken about us. But you
[6:17] know we don't care. We we push on. I was
[6:19] telling another brother what is my name?
[6:22] If I perish I perish. You know for the
[6:25] sake of Christ I must push on. I must
[6:27] say what God has put in my heart to say.
[6:29] I don't care what they say about me.
[6:31] It's the word that must get forward.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; And uh so and uh if Christ took it, if
[6:37] every other person in the Bible took it,
[6:39] you know, it's um it's it's such an
[6:41] amazing time. I think also
[6:45] uh I'm I'm so sort of surprised at some
[6:49] of the message ministers who like think
[6:53] we are still in a wilderness walk.
[6:57] like they don't realize we've long
[6:59] crossed Jordan.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; We don't associate even with the type of
[7:04] Moses in the wilderness having those
[7:06] troubles.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; We don't we're we've crossed over
[7:09] Jordan. We're in the promised land.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; I would venture to say we're even past
[7:13] the days of judges.
[7:15] &gt;&gt; We're right now in a place where they
[7:17] need to choose a king.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[7:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. that if you're looking at the type
[7:22] I'm I'm saying that's where I think we
[7:24] are because like you've got Eli and
[7:26] Samuel the last judges of Israel and
[7:28] it's time to choose a king and they're
[7:29] going to choose Saul
[7:32] &gt;&gt; and that's to me it's that time where
[7:34] the human being is is to place someone
[7:37] on his throne.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; That's where we are. I'm not looking to
[7:41] a wilderness ministry with Moses and all
[7:43] these people tying me down to quotes of
[7:45] brother Bham and trying to cage me and
[7:49] &gt;&gt; help. You don't know where we are.
[7:52] &gt;&gt; We've crossed Jordan. We're in the
[7:53] promised land. We've gone through the
[7:55] days of the judges. We've been a long
[7:56] time without the prophet.
[7:58] &gt;&gt; People have not kicked out the nations
[8:00] that they were supposed to have kicked
[8:01] out.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; They still allowed those people hanging
[8:04] on. And we've gone through the days of
[8:06] the judges. people standing up and
[8:08] individuals taking the word in their
[8:10] hands to judge things. You're right now
[8:12] at the place where it's time to choose
[8:14] your king.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[8:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing. So, after our last
[8:20] service on begotten, born and converted,
[8:23] a brother met me. I must say I had after
[8:26] our brother's meeting I had my first
[8:29] social breakfast where we just had bacon
[8:31] and eggs and toast and uh with her
[8:34] brother and met with me and asked me to
[8:36] do a talk for the young people
[8:39] was quite concerned do a talk for the
[8:40] young people who want to get baptized
[8:42] and there are several young people who
[8:44] want to get baptized. So I got into my
[8:46] study and I casually started writing
[8:48] things on my board and drawing things
[8:50] out and arrows here and you know looking
[8:52] at things. Then it started forming into
[8:54] something that I started getting excited
[8:56] about because it was very much you know
[8:59] in line with the things we were teaching
[9:00] and begotten born and converted. So here
[9:03] we are.
[9:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Lord has laid something very
[9:06] simple yet very important on my heart
[9:09] and I believe it will help those
[9:12] starting out and also those who started
[9:16] out a long time ago and got caught up in
[9:18] worldly things and then others who
[9:21] forgot why they are called.
[9:23] &gt;&gt; So we're all in this.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I just want to say to you uh
[9:27] church, I really appreciate you. You've
[9:29] got no idea how many people appreciate
[9:31] you. We're just a few people here but um
[9:35] you have become a machine
[9:39] by which the word can reach many people
[9:43] and by the anointing you bring to the
[9:46] word it is affecting many people's lives
[9:49] and that's I believe what is what is
[9:51] what we are here for. Amen.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; So it brought me to this uh title
[9:57] uh two baptisms
[9:59] and three purgings. two baptisms and
[10:03] three purgings. And this follows up from
[10:06] some of the things we have been teaching
[10:08] recently and to to think it all started
[10:11] when I preached in the USA on the Holy
[10:13] Ghost and the Holy Spirit and the
[10:16] debacle that followed. I cannot tell you
[10:18] the amount of questions that have risen
[10:21] up from people just crying out for help.
[10:24] Just explain this to me. What you know
[10:26] uh how do I get the Holy Ghost? I
[10:29] believe what you're saying and you know
[10:30] the amount of questions and confusions
[10:33] that people have had in the past and
[10:34] saying you cleared it up for me. I now
[10:37] understand what I have. And that was the
[10:39] whole point of it. The whole point of it
[10:40] was to say there are so much of
[10:42] confusion with people as to whether they
[10:44] have the Holy Ghost or not because this
[10:46] Pentecostal idea is being revived and
[10:49] there people today who said they had the
[10:52] Holy Ghost 20 years ago are now doubting
[10:56] whether they have it. So that was the
[10:58] whole point of the message was to to
[11:00] bring that to the forefront and show you
[11:01] you are in a new day and there's a
[11:04] calling on your life, right? And so in
[11:07] our um so that's kind of like um the
[11:10] last few weeks since we got back, it's
[11:12] just been an a non-stop
[11:16] amount of questions and people just in
[11:19] need. And I've been trying to keep up
[11:21] with it. But um soon we I I I think
[11:24] we'll probably get back to our series in
[11:26] the name of God. Amen. So when we're
[11:29] looking at Ephesians 5:25-27,
[11:33] there are four things there that I want
[11:35] to bring out to to you. And um in that
[11:40] he says he um husbands love your wives
[11:43] as Christ loved the church and gave
[11:46] himself for it. And then he said so that
[11:49] he could sanctify. Now remember sanctify
[11:52] we spoke on recently to make holy and we
[11:56] showed you we went in detail what
[11:58] consecration is what sanctification is
[12:00] and that it is not how good you are how
[12:03] good you are at keeping the message to
[12:05] be made holy is to be made useful
[12:08] &gt;&gt; right so and useful for his purpose and
[12:13] then we've got the word cleanse he said
[12:15] to so to sanctify and to cleanse right
[12:19] and the word cleanse
[12:21] means to purge or to purify
[12:25] uh and that means to remove
[12:27] unrighteousness. So you can when you
[12:29] think about a substance and we're going
[12:30] to talk about that and uh you're
[12:32] purifying that substance it means to
[12:34] remove impurities right. So Christ don't
[12:38] lose a thought gave himself for the
[12:41] church
[12:43] so he could sanctify and cleanse it.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. The purpose of him giving himself
[12:48] for the church was to sanctify. So you
[12:50] need to know, those of you young people
[12:52] want to get baptized, you need to know
[12:54] that Christ was manifest in the flesh
[12:57] for the purpose of sanctifying you for
[13:00] the purpose of God and for cleansing you
[13:02] for that purpose.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the first thing that needs
[13:05] to be in your hand. And then he tells us
[13:08] how he does it. So how does he sanctify?
[13:11] How does he cleanse? By the washing of
[13:14] the water. by the word.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the washing of the water is
[13:20] separation,
[13:23] &gt;&gt; right? We're going to get to that. And
[13:26] number four, by the word, which is So
[13:29] this is important. How are you
[13:30] sanctified? How are you cleansed? By the
[13:33] separation.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; By the word.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; You see it? So we want to simplify. So
[13:42] let's break it down. This week I had a
[13:44] call from a brother from the USA. We're
[13:46] just having a nice conversation. Um and
[13:50] uh he reflected the simple need. He in
[13:53] our conversation the the the thought of
[13:56] our conversation was brother this is
[13:58] what we need. Just break the word down
[14:01] so it can be applied to daily lives and
[14:05] simple understanding. and and and it
[14:08] must the word being preached on our
[14:11] message pulpits must move from theology
[14:14] to reality.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; You know, it's it's easy to just keep
[14:19] preaching words the prophet says,
[14:21] quoting quotes, making scriptures, uh
[14:24] talking about it and walking up and down
[14:26] shouting about um theology,
[14:29] but make it real.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what we we were
[14:32] discussing um the scripture um how are
[14:36] sons of God led by the spirit of God
[14:39] like and it was so simple. We were
[14:41] talking about how it's not about God
[14:44] literally showing you a pillar of fire
[14:45] or speaking in your ear. How are we led?
[14:49] Make that real.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; How am I supposed to be led of God in my
[14:55] business, in my school, in my choices?
[14:58] How am I led? Make that real. Amen.
[15:01] &gt;&gt; That's what I love.
[15:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the first thing to uh
[15:06] you know in this simple statement the
[15:09] basic understanding. So we want to make
[15:12] it real. We want to make you understand.
[15:14] So you're coming in baptism. You want to
[15:16] be baptized. We want to make it real to
[15:19] you what you're doing that you're not
[15:21] just you know um doing some church
[15:25] tradition like it is everywhere else.
[15:27] &gt;&gt; If you join our church, you must be
[15:29] baptized. you become a Christian, you
[15:31] must be baptized or else this. And then
[15:33] you say, "Well, did everybody else do
[15:35] it?" And I I've watched for so many
[15:37] years young people come to the water and
[15:39] they're so sheepish. Like, it's a very
[15:41] embarrassing thing. You know, somebody
[15:42] grabs you and dunks you in the water and
[15:45] then, you know, you come out and you're
[15:46] all splattering and wet and, you know,
[15:48] people are there handing you a towel
[15:50] singing songs. And when you're young,
[15:54] you know, and you're you're being told
[15:56] like it's it's almost like blackmail,
[15:57] like if you don't do this, you won't
[15:59] make it to heaven. You better do this.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; And uh and and that's the problem
[16:04] because they go into this being coerced
[16:07] into something and not really
[16:09] appreciating what just happened.
[16:12] So the simple basic understanding is
[16:15] that sanctifying and cleansing will be
[16:18] done by separating you from something
[16:22] else by the word.
[16:26] I'll say that again. Sanctifying and
[16:29] cleansing you as a young people, those
[16:32] wanting to be baptized,
[16:35] that separation is going to take place
[16:38] by the word. In other words, you cannot
[16:40] do this without the word. Amen.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; And that's the first thing to understand
[16:45] is that the word of God, the word of God
[16:47] for your day separates you from others.
[16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; Not people
[16:54] from other word.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[16:58] &gt;&gt; And you need to understand that. So
[17:00] let's let's go to sanctify first. Let's
[17:02] understand what it means by sanctify. So
[17:05] we have already explained this and I'm
[17:07] not going to spend too much of time on
[17:08] that. We've explained this that to be
[17:12] made holy or to be holy is or to be made
[17:17] holy is to select something to make it
[17:21] purposeful to you. So what is holy? Holy
[17:25] means to be separated for a purpose.
[17:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; Right. So if you say uh this is me
[17:33] making as real as this chair
[17:36] is separated for me to sit on to play
[17:40] the guitar.
[17:42] That's my chair.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; That means it's holy unto me.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? It's separated for a
[17:51] purpose. Nobody else touch it. And to
[17:53] make it even more holy, from henceforth,
[17:56] this chair shall not be used for
[17:59] anything else but for me to sit on to
[18:01] play the guitar.
[18:02] &gt;&gt; Nobody else can use it. It cannot be
[18:05] used for somebody else to sit on for any
[18:08] other purpose. What makes it holy is it
[18:11] is selected.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[18:13] &gt;&gt; For that particular purpose. Now that
[18:16] doesn't mean this is the best chair in
[18:18] the world. Yeah. Yeah.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean this chair is without
[18:22] fault and without blame.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean this chair was just
[18:28] poofed out of nowhere by some
[18:30] supernatural event.
[18:32] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how this chair got
[18:34] here or what generation it came in or
[18:37] who or who its parents were.
[18:42] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. What matters is my
[18:45] selection.
[18:48] for my purpose.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:50] &gt;&gt; That's what holiness is.
[18:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Right. That's a simplicity of it. So in
[18:55] this case, you are sanctified by Christ
[19:00] because you have been elected for a
[19:02] purpose. You want to get baptized, first
[19:05] thing in your mind is you've got to know
[19:07] you didn't choose to get baptized
[19:10] because you suddenly had this epiphany,
[19:14] this great idea. This is something I
[19:16] should do. it will make my life better.
[19:19] No, this is only happening to you
[19:21] because you have been feeling the
[19:23] election of God
[19:26] because his holy spirit has been
[19:27] brooding over you. Something has been
[19:30] calling you. Something has been tugging
[19:32] at you.
[19:33] And if you feel that it's going to push
[19:36] you, it's going to make you realize
[19:38] there is something about you that has
[19:39] been chosen.
[19:43] We have explained that sanctification
[19:45] does not mean you will not have errors.
[19:47] I'm going to read the quotes today. It
[19:50] doesn't mean you won't have errors. It
[19:51] doesn't mean that um or rather it it
[19:54] means there is a calling on your life.
[19:56] Sanctification means you have a calling
[19:59] on your life. Walk worthy of the
[20:02] vocation wherewith you are called.
[20:04] Ephesians 4:1.
[20:07] you uh uh in in Romans 8, it tells you
[20:11] you have been called. All things work
[20:13] together for the good to them that are
[20:15] called
[20:17] to them that love God and are called.
[20:19] They are called. There is a calling on
[20:22] your life. You're not here because you
[20:24] had a great idea that you should be in
[20:26] the message.
[20:29] And the thing is that calling is not
[20:31] like you were walking one day in school
[20:34] and you heard Alistister
[20:40] Mark.
[20:41] You're expecting Moses.
[20:44] [Music]
[20:45] No, it's it's so far from that. It's
[20:48] not. Sometimes we wish it was like that,
[20:51] &gt;&gt; you know, then we like be sure.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; But look at Moses. He actually had that
[20:56] calling and said, "You're making a
[20:58] mistake." Well, what makes you think
[21:00] you'll be different? H um half of you,
[21:04] probably all of you, Lord, just speak to
[21:06] me. Just tell me what to do. And you're
[21:09] so confident in yourself. You're such a
[21:11] good person that if God actually told
[21:12] you by an audible voice that you would
[21:15] actually do it. We have proof in the
[21:18] Bible that a man is called by a burning
[21:20] bush, pillar of fire, supernatural voice
[21:23] speaking to him and still he's
[21:25] disobedient.
[21:27] What makes you think you're better than
[21:29] Moses?
[21:32] &gt;&gt; So it means there is a calling on your
[21:34] life to be used of the word of God and
[21:36] for the purpose of Christ. And if you're
[21:39] coming to sanctification, it means you
[21:42] have recognized the calling. Don't be
[21:45] ashamed of that. Don't be ashamed to say
[21:47] that. I've recognized I feel I believe I
[21:51] am called by him. All right. So, we get
[21:55] to this other part cleansing. To
[21:58] cleanse. Um, for those of you who know
[22:01] English, the word cleanse comes from the
[22:04] word the root word clean.
[22:07] Amen. Now this is where we have the
[22:10] problem because people's interpretation
[22:12] of clean uh you know oh it's a it's a
[22:16] clean life
[22:18] you know I watched this movie it was a
[22:19] clean movie
[22:24] clean why it didn't have this it didn't
[22:26] have that it didn't have that you know
[22:27] it didn't have violence it didn't have
[22:28] sexuality didn't have swearing so it's a
[22:31] clean movie it had a whole lot of
[22:33] ideology ology
[22:38] cleanse coming from the word cle in the
[22:41] original words of the Bible it means
[22:44] purging. The literal word is pur.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; Purge
[22:49] from the uh European languages. Purge to
[22:54] clean, right? And purge and and and also
[22:58] to purify. Both coming from the same
[23:01] root words. The two words are so
[23:03] similar. But purging is an action that
[23:07] requires taking something contaminated
[23:11] out of something.
[23:13] So, in other words, like when you're
[23:15] purging something, meaning you're
[23:16] cleaning something, something dirty at
[23:18] home, some dish that you cooked in, or
[23:21] maybe um I don't know, your barbecue
[23:25] stand after you've used it, and you're
[23:27] using detergents to break down difficult
[23:30] and stubborn substances, right? So, you
[23:33] need like some kind of detergent to
[23:36] purge something, right? In other words,
[23:39] so um using something else to clean
[23:43] something else. Am I breaking it down?
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Right now, usually there's some kind of
[23:49] purging agent that is required to break
[23:51] down a stubborn contaminants. But
[23:55] purifying
[23:56] means So that's purging. Purifying means
[24:00] to remove impurities.
[24:03] &gt;&gt; Pure.
[24:04] Okay, I love that because in other
[24:07] words, there's something about me that
[24:09] is pure.
[24:12] There's a pure me somewhere.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; There's just some impurities inside that
[24:18] if it was just taken out,
[24:20] &gt;&gt; I'd be a pure substance.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; I love that thought.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:25] &gt;&gt; Right. So, for example, if you purify
[24:27] gold, like you take a a clump of rock
[24:31] with gold in that rock and you take a
[24:34] hammer at it. First, you're going to
[24:36] break down whatever chunks of dirt and
[24:40] rock and stone and it'll just fall away.
[24:43] Then, you take this gold and you put it
[24:45] in a furnace, right? And then it's going
[24:47] to melt. The gold is going to melt. And
[24:49] when gold melts, all the solid rock and
[24:52] different impurities start to rise to
[24:54] the surface.
[24:55] Right? So it means what we're saying is
[24:57] there's gold there but in the gold there
[25:00] are particles and clumps of other
[25:02] substances that is not gold.
[25:06] &gt;&gt; So to make it pure gold you have to
[25:09] remove everything from it that is not
[25:11] gold.
[25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. So the purpose of cleansing
[25:16] now remember Christ gave himself to
[25:19] sanctify and cleanse.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. by the washing of the water by the
[25:24] word. So why are we so invested in the
[25:28] word? Because the word is the thing that
[25:30] can wash you, that can bring cleansing,
[25:32] that can bring sanctification.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; Not church, not religion, the word.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; A lot of people can have church and no
[25:41] word. And if you have no word, you have
[25:43] no sanctification and no cleansing.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; You just have religion. Right? So, I
[25:48] feel like a lot of us tend to put a
[25:52] pause on God's process of cleansing and
[25:55] we don't realize how it affects our uh
[25:57] us or our effectuality.
[26:01] You are literally gold
[26:05] and you've got impurities stuck inside.
[26:07] As long as you still have impurities
[26:09] stuck inside, you can't be effectually
[26:12] used.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Yeah.
[26:15] &gt;&gt; So the purpose of cleansing and
[26:18] purification
[26:19] for you as an individual and you need to
[26:23] understand it, you need to appreciate
[26:24] it, right? And this is why I say it's
[26:28] going to help a lot of us because a lot
[26:29] of us are waterbaptized 20 something
[26:31] years ago or 30 years ago and then we
[26:34] forgot that we were we were chosen.
[26:37] We forgot that we were selected to be
[26:39] holy
[26:41] and we we kind of paused the the
[26:45] sanctification or the cleansing process.
[26:48] We stopped allowing him to remove the
[26:50] clumps of impurities out of us.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; And so we are being used in some way but
[26:56] not to its full effectualness.
[27:00] In other words, for you to be used in an
[27:03] optimum level of ability,
[27:06] it would be necessary to remove all
[27:09] impurities and substances or let's make
[27:12] it clear characteristics about you
[27:15] personally that do not comply with the
[27:19] purpose of God.
[27:22] For example, if you were a person who
[27:24] was impatient,
[27:26] and I'm using this the silliest one,
[27:30] and you are impatient,
[27:32] you're callous. In other words, you're a
[27:35] person who's just so impulsive, you just
[27:37] want to do something and you just can't
[27:39] wait. Right? If you you get this thought
[27:42] in your mind, you just want to do it
[27:44] without understanding or taking some
[27:47] cognizance of the risks behind. You're
[27:49] just an impatient person. And God has
[27:52] called you and he puts you through a
[27:53] cleansing experience. And he puts you
[27:56] through an experience to get the nature
[27:58] out of you.
[27:59] &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, if you want to purify
[28:01] gold, it takes heat.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; You got to take the heat,
[28:07] &gt;&gt; right? And so God put you through this
[28:09] cleansing. In other words, you're going
[28:11] through some experience in your life
[28:13] that's knocking you. If you were not
[28:16] selected, you wouldn't be going through
[28:17] it.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; If you were not sanctified to him, you
[28:23] would you would not be going. You would
[28:25] probably be enjoying that bad
[28:28] characteristic you've been living with
[28:29] for so long. And nobody's going to tell
[28:31] you a thing. Would go on in the world
[28:33] and that thing would would amplify
[28:35] itself through your life. And you might
[28:36] even become the CEO of some great
[28:39] Fortune 500 company and who cares,
[28:44] right? And you got there with that clump
[28:46] of
[28:48] impurity
[28:51] cuz that's what it takes. You can't tell
[28:54] me you become a businessman without
[28:55] being a cheat. I mean, I'm sorry.
[29:00] You know what you're doing. You get up
[29:02] there and you're earning millions and
[29:04] billions. You've lied. You've cheated.
[29:07] You've broken all the rules. There's no
[29:09] way anyone who sticks with all the rules
[29:12] gets that rich.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Impossible.
[29:18] Right. In this country, by the way, our
[29:22] um you've got simple people here in
[29:25] Durban and we know everybody, right? You
[29:29] don't become multi-millionaire
[29:31] here in Durban without having been
[29:33] involved in drugs.
[29:36] No, all those little copper shops and
[29:38] stuff, they were all fronts. There was
[29:40] drugs happening behind illegal trade and
[29:43] and then that was I'm talking about
[29:44] generations back and then it's passed
[29:46] down to the sons and then passed down to
[29:48] this one and that one. Now they are
[29:49] multi-million dollar companies and
[29:52] stuff, but it all started with drugs and
[29:53] illegal stuff.
[29:55] We know them. We know the families. We
[29:58] know how it got to the place that is
[29:59] now. They're like this accounting firm.
[30:02] It started with drugs.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; It's amazing.
[30:07] Uh if you're a straight button person,
[30:10] straight shooter, it's very hard for you
[30:13] to rise up that high in this world.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; It's almost impossible.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Don't don't differ with me. The Lord
[30:20] Jesus says that.
[30:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Right. Or that's what he implies in the
[30:25] scripture. So what I'm saying to you is
[30:28] every one of us has these
[30:30] characteristics in us that
[30:33] they are clumps of impurities that's not
[30:36] conducive to the holiness of God to the
[30:40] purpose of God. Are you with me? So you
[30:43] know um how can you deal? So if if
[30:47] you're a person coming back to the
[30:48] person who's impatient and God has
[30:50] called you to his purpose to save souls
[30:54] to deal with people if you're an
[30:56] impatient person how are you going to
[30:59] bring souls to Christ?
[31:02] Because people, man, they can really
[31:04] test your patience. Because anything
[31:07] that can test your patience is people,
[31:09] right? And and you are entering a
[31:11] training field, which means God is going
[31:13] to put you through the test to make you
[31:16] patient. And how can you deal with
[31:18] problematic people if you are impatient?
[31:20] And that is just one attribute. Most
[31:22] people who come to Christ and you know,
[31:25] they say, "I've converted. I've become a
[31:26] Christian." Many times they think of
[31:28] cleansing and sanctification. God took
[31:31] me away from drinking and smoking and
[31:34] drugs and cursing and fornication and
[31:36] those kind of things. And thank the
[31:38] Lord, he took me away from that. But uh
[31:41] if I had to describe it, if you take a
[31:43] whole rock and there's gold inside and
[31:46] then you start heating it up and then
[31:48] what rises to the top, all those big
[31:50] chunks that you can just scoop away with
[31:52] a with a ladle, that's like drinking,
[31:55] smoking, fornication, those are big
[31:58] chunks of rocks. And then when all those
[32:00] things are gone, you think, "Yes, I'm
[32:02] sanctified."
[32:04] No, there's all these little particles
[32:06] inside
[32:08] &gt;&gt; that if you don't get it out, it will
[32:10] fracture the gold.
[32:13] &gt;&gt; And those little ones are the ones you
[32:15] don't want to get rid of. Those are the
[32:16] ones you're proud of. Those are the ones
[32:19] God made me this way.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; Right? So, if I had to describe it, I
[32:24] would say those things, drinking,
[32:27] smoking, those are the easiest things to
[32:29] get rid of in the refiner's fire. It's
[32:32] like if you find a clump of gold, in the
[32:34] moment you put it in the furnace, the
[32:36] heavy chunks rise to the top, you scoop
[32:38] it out, but the tiny specks of impurity.
[32:41] And a lot of times there's lookalike
[32:44] gold, too.
[32:47] And it requires a process, a deeper
[32:51] process of the refiner's fire.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a lot of things in us that
[32:55] uh is lookalike gold and we glorify it
[32:59] and we think it is and we think we can
[33:01] use that for God's purpose and he's not
[33:04] interested in that. He wants to burn
[33:05] that thing out.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; He's got to purify it. Amen. So we get
[33:10] to this part where there are two
[33:14] processes of Christ's purpose in giving
[33:17] his life in shedding his blood for the
[33:19] church. Sanctification and cleansing.
[33:22] Notice
[33:24] we are not sanctified and cleansed by
[33:26] the literal blood of Christ. We are here
[33:30] 225 years or so after the Lord Jesus
[33:34] Christ. Give or take a few years maybe.
[33:37] We have not seen the literal blood of
[33:39] Christ. Nobody has it. If anyone claims
[33:40] it, they're a liar.
[33:43] Nobody has a drop of the literal blood
[33:45] of Christ. And even if you did, it ain't
[33:48] going to make any difference because
[33:50] it's not that chemistry.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; Right. So, you are not cleansed and
[33:56] sanctified by the literal blood. Paul
[33:58] tells us in Ephesians how we are
[34:00] sanctified and cleansed. And it is by
[34:03] the washing of water by the word.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Now the first thing is you don't
[34:10] understand washing of water by the word.
[34:12] I know this
[34:14] &gt;&gt; because you are not Jewish people
[34:17] &gt;&gt; and that is a Jewish people tradition.
[34:22] &gt;&gt; So what is that? So most people say
[34:24] water baptism but it says washing of
[34:28] water by the word.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; Okay. What does that mean? It's a Jewish
[34:33] custom. We spoke about this recently
[34:36] recently when I think it could have been
[34:37] a Wednesday night. I did a question and
[34:39] answer. I'm not can't remember now, but
[34:41] remember we were talking about Aaron and
[34:43] his sons being washed by the prophet.
[34:45] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Right. This is where it comes from.
[34:49] Aaron and his sons were washed by Moses
[34:54] in their linen garments at the
[34:56] tabernacle
[34:58] from the brazen labor of water.
[35:02] Okay, what does that mean to you? So
[35:06] this statement by the washing of the
[35:08] water by the word is a statement
[35:11] referring to that Jewish symbol.
[35:14] Right? So people, Christians today have
[35:17] just taken this water baptism thing and
[35:20] don't understand anything.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; Everybody gets baptized. You get these
[35:23] little babies, they bring them before
[35:24] this dish, they gunk them in, some of
[35:26] them sprinkle them, and it's a family
[35:28] thing. And or you get baptized, you get
[35:31] confirmed or something, and you go out
[35:34] and become an absolute rascal,
[35:39] man. Even the worst leaders of drug
[35:42] cartels are properly baptized.
[35:48] Huh? They'll be going there to to shoot
[35:50] up a whole place and they'll be busy
[35:52] crossing themselves. Lord, give us the
[35:54] grace to kill all these people
[35:57] so we can get rich. That's how crazy
[36:00] they are. They don't understand water
[36:01] baptism. They don't understand washing
[36:03] of the water by the word.
[36:06] Why? because it's a Jewish custom which
[36:08] became a symbol in the scripture to
[36:10] teach us something.
[36:12] So that was a what was the tradition?
[36:15] What was the whole idea the symbolism of
[36:18] Aaron being washed by the prophet?
[36:22] It was simply this Aaron who used to be
[36:25] who was of the tribe of Levi, the
[36:27] brother of Moses. He was leading the
[36:29] people with Moses from uh he he was this
[36:33] man who was the older brother of Moses.
[36:35] He was uh he was uh speaking to the
[36:38] people and convincing them of Moses
[36:40] ministry. He was helping Moses with on
[36:42] the route towards the promised land. And
[36:45] he was this slave in in Goan. He wasn't
[36:49] a regular man. He had ambitions. Maybe
[36:52] he wanted to have a few kids. He had a
[36:54] few kids. He had some sons. He probably
[36:56] want to think, well, when we get to the
[36:58] promised land, I, you know, I picked up
[37:00] some some uh skills in Goan, you know,
[37:03] I'm I'm some kind of builder, you know,
[37:05] and I I fashion some I want to open up a
[37:08] business. I I've got all these um great
[37:10] talents, you know, and I'm just waiting
[37:12] for Moses to get us to a place and I'm
[37:14] going to I'm going to do what God has
[37:16] called me, you know, given me these
[37:18] gifts. I'm so good. Maybe I'm a I'm a
[37:20] carpenter. Maybe I'm a builder. Maybe
[37:22] I'm a stonemason. And Aaron has all
[37:24] these um these these talents, these
[37:27] gifts. And God says, "No,
[37:31] you are being chosen for the priesthood.
[37:34] You are being called for the priesthood.
[37:36] The washing of the water by the word is
[37:40] a symbol of what? Washing away all
[37:44] thoughts of what he thought his life
[37:48] should be.
[37:51] It's called the waters of separation.
[37:55] Separation from what? Not people,
[38:00] right? It's an ancient tradition, not a
[38:02] modern day one. So it is something that
[38:04] is foreign to us and uh this is where
[38:08] the ritual of water baptism comes from.
[38:10] So when those people came to Christ and
[38:14] they were being water baptized they were
[38:15] being baptized by Peter and James and
[38:18] John and all the disciples
[38:20] what was the baptism signify? We are
[38:23] separating ourselves from our previous
[38:25] self
[38:27] to accept a new self
[38:31] chosen and elected by God.
[38:35] When you come to water baptism, you are
[38:37] conscious of the separation.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; And it's not a se you're still going to
[38:44] be in Durban.
[38:46] &gt;&gt; You're still going to be in the same
[38:47] house. You're still going to be doing
[38:49] the same job. You're still going to be
[38:51] going to the same school. You're still
[38:53] going to be called by the same name.
[38:56] But you need to be separated
[38:59] from all previous or past self.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; And realize you have been called to a
[39:06] new self.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. How are you going to know that?
[39:11] How are you going to know that without
[39:13] the word? That's why it's a washing of
[39:16] water by the word.
[39:19] Amen. So if we had to make this plain,
[39:22] we are saying that the act of washing
[39:24] Aaron in pure water indicated that all
[39:29] that was Aaron is no more and a new
[39:32] Aaron is being presented.
[39:35] That is what washing of water by the
[39:37] word means. Separating the old Aaron and
[39:41] presenting a new Aaron. So all this
[39:44] man's dreams, all his ambitions, all his
[39:48] gifts, it doesn't matter if he was a
[39:50] stonemason. Doesn't matter if he was a
[39:52] carpenter. It doesn't matter if he if he
[39:54] had some ambitions to have a fields and
[39:57] a farm and all kinds of career. Right
[40:00] now he's going to be dressed in
[40:02] something he never dreamed of. the
[40:05] miter, the breastplate, the linen
[40:07] garments, the pomegranates and bells,
[40:10] the the purple and the scarlet and the
[40:12] blue, and um he's going to be baking
[40:16] showbread. He's going to be uh cleaning
[40:19] up seven golden candlesticks and uh
[40:22] putting incense upon an altar and and
[40:25] risking his life to take blood into the
[40:27] holy place. He never dreamed of that. He
[40:31] was called to that. He then had to live
[40:33] his life dedicated to that selection.
[40:38] This is a new errand he never dreamed
[40:40] of. This Aaron could only be revealed by
[40:45] the word.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; He would never know what to separate
[40:48] himself from to
[40:52] Amen.
[40:54] If the word was not made known, if we
[40:57] had to make this plain, Aaron was being
[41:00] separated from a previous Aaron to a new
[41:02] era. So when you come to water baptism,
[41:05] you recognize what the washing of the
[41:07] water by the word is. Young people, you
[41:10] are choosing to be what God wants you to
[41:14] be and not your previous self.
[41:19] by the word. The phrase by the word. So
[41:23] in the scripture Paul tells us that it
[41:25] is the word that separates us,
[41:26] sanctifies us and cleanses us. So we
[41:30] again
[41:32] again uh Christians, some Christian
[41:34] denominations have this pure water
[41:36] thing. There's no pure water.
[41:40] You can bless it how many times? You can
[41:43] say a prayer over it, but the person who
[41:45] prayed over it could be contaminated.
[41:49] Yeah,
[41:50] &gt;&gt; you could say words over it, but the
[41:52] words that were spoken could have been
[41:54] contaminated.
[41:55] There is no pure water,
[41:59] &gt;&gt; right? Can you How do we know this?
[42:02] Elijah told that fellow non to go dip in
[42:06] Jordan
[42:07] and he said, "Of all the rivers, the
[42:10] cleaner rivers, you make me go to that
[42:13] one." It actually proved there was
[42:14] nothing to the water.
[42:17] It was his revelation
[42:20] &gt;&gt; in the word of the prophet. Could you
[42:22] follow the word of the prophet? It had
[42:24] nothing to do with the water.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; Imagine by the filthiest water, but by
[42:30] the word he could be cleansed of
[42:32] leprosy.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Paul tells us it is the word that
[42:38] separates us, sanctifies, cleanses us.
[42:40] So we have no pure water. That's a
[42:43] fallacy. Don't ever think, listen
[42:45] people, I don't care whether you go to
[42:47] Israel and come back with a bottle of
[42:49] water from the Jordan or the Dead Sea or
[42:53] sand from some place or I don't know
[42:55] somebody's some hair from the tomb or a
[42:59] rock from somewhere. There is no amulets
[43:02] in the mage. There's no talismans.
[43:05] There's no substances with supernatural
[43:07] powers on it.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; It's all to do with your faith. You can
[43:12] take a prayer handkerchief. It'll work
[43:13] for one person with faith and it'll not
[43:15] work for another person without faith.
[43:18] &gt;&gt; There are no talismans. Don't place
[43:20] faith in those things. That's
[43:22] superstitious natures. We don't have a
[43:25] literal blood of Christ. We do not have
[43:27] holy oil.
[43:30] We need to move away from things like
[43:32] that. If you don't recognize the word as
[43:35] your capstone and you're placing faith
[43:38] in other substances blessed by other
[43:41] men,
[43:42] you have not yet tapped into the open
[43:44] book.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; This is purely a spiritual experience
[43:50] that can only happen in the human soul
[43:52] if it makes contact with the revealed
[43:55] word for your day. And if you have been
[43:57] called to it, there would there would be
[44:01] no way Noah would have said,
[44:05] I feel like building an ark
[44:08] because I feel something is going to
[44:10] happen. There's no way you can commit
[44:13] yourself to a life unless the word
[44:15] reveals it to you.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; It has to be by the word.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. There may be people who will go
[44:23] through the tradition of baptism but not
[44:27] called by the word. They just do it for
[44:30] a form of religion. It has to be the
[44:32] word. The baptism of water must be an
[44:35] expression that in other words those of
[44:38] you wanting to get baptized the baptism
[44:41] that you are going to have is your
[44:43] outward expression that the word has
[44:45] come to you
[44:47] &gt;&gt; and you have taken it in and you've
[44:49] recognized an old self that you need to
[44:52] be separated from.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; Otherwise don't do it.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is the reason that any form
[45:00] of Christianity without the word is
[45:03] powerless.
[45:05] &gt;&gt; Any gathering of the message without the
[45:08] revealed word for your day is powerless.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; It shall not work anymore. No matter how
[45:15] many times you say the prophet's name,
[45:18] &gt;&gt; true.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Because if it is without the revealed
[45:21] word, it has no power.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; It might look attractive. It might sound
[45:26] anointed. Anything can sound anointed,
[45:29] &gt;&gt; right? You have a charismatic nature,
[45:31] you can make it sound anointed. It can
[45:34] be entertaining. It can be charismatic.
[45:37] But in the end, if it is not the word
[45:39] for your day, it cannot fully separate
[45:43] you from other purposes.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; It cannot be a washing of water.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; It cannot be a separation
[45:52] for any other purpose. it it won't even
[45:54] engage you into your new purpose because
[45:57] it has no revelation in it and it's not
[46:00] really the word for your day. How could
[46:03] Martin Luther of the Catholic Church do
[46:06] you even know what that feels like? You
[46:09] know, when when I think of people in the
[46:12] message today who are speaking against
[46:14] me,
[46:16] you know, and what am I supposed to now
[46:18] go and mope around and feel depressed? I
[46:21] can tell you right now I'm in my my
[46:23] right mind and I'm telling you right now
[46:25] whatever ministers or people speak
[46:27] against me is nothing compared to what
[46:29] Martin Luther went through. Yeah,
[46:33] &gt;&gt; I I can't go get depressed because
[46:35] someone insults me when a man like
[46:37] Martin Luther was chased off across the
[46:39] country and had the guts to go and nail
[46:41] a 95 thesis on the Catholic door knowing
[46:44] there's going to be an army chasing him
[46:46] and I'm going to be moping because
[46:48] someone spoke against me on social
[46:50] media.
[46:51] Then I'm being the exact snowflake that
[46:53] I preach against.
[46:58] Right? So in the end it's if it's not
[47:02] the word it cannot separate you. If
[47:05] Martin Luther did not get the word that
[47:07] just shall live by faith. There's no way
[47:10] he could have made this earthmoving
[47:12] decision to separate from a previous
[47:15] Luther to a new Luther
[47:19] and Wesley the same. And every single
[47:21] one of them.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; It had to take the revelation of the
[47:23] word. That is the washing of water.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. You've got to have that. So, young
[47:31] people, please understand.
[47:34] Uh
[47:37] I just want to say this before we go to
[47:38] the next uh part of this.
[47:42] You must understand that in this world
[47:45] there are so much that you are consuming
[47:47] in your mind today
[47:50] in terms of what people say, in terms of
[47:52] what people teach, in terms of the
[47:54] message, in terms of the media, in terms
[47:56] of uh anything that's occurring in this
[47:58] world and your mind is being filled with
[48:02] word.
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[48:04] &gt;&gt; your mind is being trained, your mind is
[48:07] being coached to make you to form you
[48:10] into a certain person. But if it's not
[48:12] the word of God, it's filling you with
[48:14] chunks of impurities.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; It's filling you up with an idea of what
[48:20] you think you should be. And if God is
[48:22] calling you, I can tell you 100%. That's
[48:25] not going to help you.
[48:28] You need to see the word of God for your
[48:29] day and what he's called you for your
[48:31] day. Amen.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; So, let's go to the two baptisms.
[48:36] Okay? So, and we'll start with the
[48:38] baptism of water. So there's the two
[48:41] baptisms. Now where's this from? This is
[48:42] from John the Baptist. John the Baptist
[48:45] said, "I baptize you with water unto
[48:48] repentance.
[48:49] But he is coming and he is going to
[48:53] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[48:54] fire." So two baptisms, right? Water
[48:57] baptism and baptism of Holy Ghost and
[49:00] fire. So I'm I'm going to start with
[49:02] water baptism because that's what
[49:03] brother asked me to speak to you about.
[49:05] And those of you sitting here thinking,
[49:08] I've already been baptized. Why do I
[49:10] need to listen to this? Trust me, you
[49:11] need to listen to this.
[49:14] So when we look at the first scripture
[49:16] we read, Matthew 3:11-12,
[49:19] that the words of John the Baptist here
[49:21] telling us of these two baptism is quite
[49:23] amazing. He explains how listen I've
[49:28] been baptized many years ago. I lived in
[49:30] this message many years for many years
[49:32] of my life and then I became a preacher
[49:34] and a pastor and still I'm fascinated by
[49:37] this. Right? So I don't think you should
[49:40] be ever thinking I don't need to listen
[49:42] to this. This is important for all of
[49:44] us.
[49:45] John the Baptist explains how that it is
[49:48] his duty to baptize you with water unto
[49:53] repentance.
[49:56] So let's understand this. His job was to
[49:58] prepare the people for the coming of
[50:01] Christ.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Right? Okay. So everyone clear. I want
[50:05] us to be clear. I want to please don't
[50:07] sleep on me.
[50:09] Let's be crystal clear what John the
[50:11] Baptist is about cuz I feel like a lot
[50:13] of people put very little importance on
[50:17] their baptism.
[50:20] Not really considering it. Okay. So he
[50:24] emphasizes that he baptized with water
[50:28] unto repentance and he was the one
[50:32] preparing them to recognize the coming
[50:35] of Christ. That's huge
[50:40] &gt;&gt; because that's what the prophet of this
[50:42] day was also doing,
[50:45] &gt;&gt; right? And so what was he getting them
[50:48] to repent of?
[50:52] That's what's important. See, he wants
[50:55] them to recognize the coming of Christ.
[50:58] He wants them to repent of their
[51:01] previous understandings of the coming of
[51:03] Christ,
[51:04] &gt;&gt; of all their expectations.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; You've got to repent from that. You've
[51:09] got to change from that. You've got to
[51:11] put that right. You've got to be washed
[51:14] by the water of the word that John the
[51:16] Baptist was preaching and come to the
[51:18] literal water baptism to express that
[51:20] you believe his word.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; So let's explain that to you. His job to
[51:27] prepare them for the coming of Christ.
[51:29] And his message, John the Baptist
[51:32] message was that the Messiah
[51:35] is among us.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he's going to reveal himself
[51:41] at the time he has chosen. He is among
[51:45] us. Oh, wake up people.
[51:49] Put yourself in those people's shoes.
[51:51] His message was also to tell the people
[51:54] that in their present condition with the
[51:58] Messiah being among them, they would not
[52:00] recognize him.
[52:04] because of their present condition. If
[52:06] he reveals himself, they will not
[52:08] recognize him.
[52:12] You know, I think very people understand
[52:14] the gravity of John the Baptist's
[52:16] message.
[52:18] Every one of us hears brother man talk
[52:21] about oh you know a guy wild man lived
[52:23] in the desert you know uh ate wild
[52:26] locust and honey and dressed in skins
[52:28] and came out rugged smelly and with a
[52:30] beard and his hair not combed and
[52:33] shouted at the people and spoke and we
[52:35] all looked at him thinking yeah you know
[52:36] what evangelist you know he was calling
[52:39] people to repent from the evil ways and
[52:42] no he had a message his message was I am
[52:45] here to introduce the Messiah The Holy
[52:48] Spirit has revealed that to me. I am the
[52:50] voice of one crying in the wilderness,
[52:52] prepare ye the way of the Lord. We quote
[52:55] that scripture and don't understand what
[52:57] his message really was. His message was
[52:59] the Messiah is here with me
[53:02] &gt;&gt; among us and in your present condition.
[53:05] You will not recognize him if you remain
[53:07] this way.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; That was his message. That was the word
[53:11] that would wash them.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; The baptism was only the expression of
[53:15] that word. Yeah.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; So it was his message that would then
[53:21] his message would give them the ability.
[53:24] If they accepted his message and were
[53:26] washed by it, then they would see him.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; So what was the need for him doing a
[53:36] baptism? And what do the people have to
[53:38] repent of? So, was it really about their
[53:41] human errors or unrighteousness?
[53:45] Or of course there is some there is some
[53:47] of that. I mean, if you're a person
[53:49] that's enjoying yourself in
[53:51] unrighteousness, when the Messiah comes,
[53:54] you'll be so hooked up with your
[53:56] unrighteousness, you'll not go listen to
[53:58] his message.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; There is that, right? But unfortunately,
[54:03] there's a lot more than that.
[54:05] John's message of repentance was
[54:08] actually that they all knew about the
[54:12] that that all they knew about the
[54:13] Messiah previously was wrong.
[54:16] How do we know that?
[54:21] &gt;&gt; It was wrong. What they were expecting
[54:23] was wrong. And it was so wrong that if
[54:25] he revealed himself before them, they
[54:27] wouldn't accept it.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; And we know this because even the
[54:32] ministry of that day came to him. Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; And asked him, "Are you the Messiah?"
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; So in itself, him being questioned by
[54:43] the ministry
[54:45] &gt;&gt; proves he was right. His message was
[54:48] right. They were unsure of what the
[54:51] Messiah would be.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; To the point of them asking him, tell us
[54:55] plainly,
[54:57] "Are you that prophet
[55:00] or are you him?"
[55:02] So his message proved the point.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; You love him saints.
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:12] &gt;&gt; So it was definitely the question of the
[55:14] day because when Christ came, they asked
[55:16] Christ the same question. And here are
[55:18] these two. I love this so much. Here are
[55:21] these two in the same time getting the
[55:25] same question.
[55:26] And they are both speaking the word that
[55:29] they are meant to speak. He's preparing
[55:32] the way for them. He's telling them, "Do
[55:34] you know who that is?"
[55:37] &gt;&gt; And they're both, all the people are
[55:39] asking them, "Are you are you him? Are
[55:42] you him?"
[55:44] And the point was proved that they were
[55:48] so messed up in their minds, they could
[55:50] not tell who the Messiah was.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; He was right. So some people thought
[55:56] John the Baptist was the Messiah, and
[55:58] some of them began to respect him. So
[56:00] this is what happened and I really want
[56:03] you to wake up to this. While Christ was
[56:06] there and preaching,
[56:09] John still had his own disciples
[56:12] &gt;&gt; who were not following Jesus.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; How do we know this? Because some
[56:17] disciples left John and went to follow
[56:19] Jesus.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Why? Because even those disciples of
[56:25] John were nervous of who Jesus was. He
[56:29] was doing things and acting in ways that
[56:32] they even following John the Baptist
[56:35] message had not really given up their
[56:38] previous ideas.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; This is what we've got today. We have a
[56:44] whole lot of brandites
[56:48] &gt;&gt; who have not gotten into the opening of
[56:50] the seventh seal
[56:52] &gt;&gt; who do not recognize the coming of the
[56:54] Lord who cannot see the Messiah among
[56:56] them.
[57:00] And no, that's not a man. That's not
[57:03] brother so and so. That's not apostle so
[57:05] and so. That's not prophet so and so. If
[57:08] you don't know what the Messiah is, if
[57:10] you don't know what William Brandham was
[57:12] introducing, you will not be able to see
[57:14] it.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; William Brandham was introducing the
[57:21] Messiah.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; What is the Messiah? The word made
[57:25] flesh.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:28] That's how simple the message is. So
[57:31] John's message of repentance was that
[57:34] they had to get rid of all that they had
[57:37] previously believed and and previously
[57:39] taught. They had to relinquish it. They
[57:41] had to put it away from them and forsake
[57:43] everything that they knew as false. You
[57:47] come to water baptism, you put away
[57:50] everything you previously knew. You make
[57:52] it known in your mind. All that I
[57:54] previously knew was false. Yeah,
[57:57] &gt;&gt; I am willing to accept the word. I
[57:59] believe the word even though I cannot
[58:01] explain everything. Even though I don't
[58:03] know the meaning of all things, I accept
[58:05] I can see that the way I was looking at
[58:08] things was wrong.
[58:10] And you have the washing of water by the
[58:12] word. In other words, a separation from
[58:14] my previous self. Praise be to God.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:18] &gt;&gt; And they had to relinquish it. Many of
[58:19] them did. They put it away from them.
[58:21] They forsook everything. They literally,
[58:24] again, because we're sitting here in
[58:26] 2025 and we don't know what those people
[58:28] went through, they had to go to their
[58:30] rabbis.
[58:32] They were baptized by a rabbi, a
[58:34] respected man in their village in their
[58:38] suburb. They had to go to the rabbi and
[58:40] say, "I am leaving.
[58:43] I am following John."
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Can do you even know what that must have
[58:48] been like?
[58:50] water a young man coming to his father
[58:52] who supports the rabbi
[58:55] in their street and the father is saying
[58:58] you are my oldest son you want to follow
[59:00] that guy at the river shouting we don't
[59:03] even know where he came from we don't
[59:04] know and this rabbi baptized you when
[59:07] you were a baby this rabbi blessed you
[59:09] for us this rabbi was the one who helped
[59:11] us name you and you have forsaken him
[59:18] you Well, don't just read your Bible.
[59:22] Enjoy your Bible.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; When you read those stories, let your
[59:26] mind go into that time.
[59:29] Think of those cobbled streets. Think of
[59:32] the life that was there. Read a read a
[59:35] scripture and and meditate on it. Read a
[59:38] scripture and dream on it. Think of what
[59:42] it was. Think of what it was for those
[59:44] people in John the Baptist's day to have
[59:46] to give up their previous thought and
[59:48] come to the waters of separation.
[59:51] Think long on it. Spend a day on
[59:53] thinking on it. You will be so inspired.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; You can enjoy every verse in the
[1:00:00] scripture like that.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Let alone the message.
[1:00:06] Praise be to God. That believer would
[1:00:09] have to reject the words of the ministry
[1:00:11] for his day and leave from following
[1:00:13] rabbis and Pharisees and Sadducees. Do
[1:00:16] you know why Pharisees and Sadducees
[1:00:18] were getting so upset? They were losing
[1:00:20] members.
[1:00:22] They were losing following.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; They were losing credibility
[1:00:27] and they had to come out of the shadows
[1:00:28] into the public because their members
[1:00:31] were now standing on the banks of the
[1:00:32] river. They had to come show themselves.
[1:00:34] And you had men like Nicodemus come by
[1:00:37] night.
[1:00:38] So he's not found out. This has been
[1:00:41] happening for a long time.
[1:00:46] You have no idea how many Nicodemuses
[1:00:48] there are today.
[1:00:52] It's incredible when I mean come by
[1:00:54] night. They don't eventually you get
[1:00:57] some who, you know, like, "Yeah, but I
[1:01:00] have to stay with my pastor what my
[1:01:01] pastor said." But I absolutely see what
[1:01:04] you're saying, brother.
[1:01:06] I believe what you're preaching is the
[1:01:08] truth. But what can I do?
[1:01:12] You haven't accepted the washing of
[1:01:14] water by the word.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; If if you're in a place where they're
[1:01:19] preaching the seven seal is closed or
[1:01:22] everything is for the future and the
[1:01:24] thunders is for the future and
[1:01:25] Revelations 10 is for the future, my
[1:01:27] friend, you have not come yet to the
[1:01:29] washing of water by the word. You have
[1:01:32] not even recognized the messenger's
[1:01:34] message that you must repent of that.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; The symbolism of John's water baptism.
[1:01:43] He openly confesses. The symbol
[1:01:45] symbolism of it was he was to wash them
[1:01:48] with water but only because they
[1:01:50] believed in his message. Amen. They had
[1:01:54] to believe in his message first to
[1:01:56] accept the baptism. Are you with us? So
[1:01:58] to be baptized of John I meant they
[1:02:01] confessed at they confessed that any
[1:02:03] other message was not for them and they
[1:02:06] were wholly dedicating themselves to
[1:02:08] John message in anticipation of meeting
[1:02:11] the Messiah himself.
[1:02:14] That is how waters of separation young
[1:02:16] people that's what water baptism means.
[1:02:19] If you're coming to water of baptism,
[1:02:21] then you're saying, "Brother Al, I
[1:02:24] accept everything that I once knew about
[1:02:28] Christ. everything that I once knew or
[1:02:31] doesn't matter who you are, young
[1:02:32] people, old people, I'm coming to Christ
[1:02:36] and I believe that the message of the
[1:02:38] hour is the only true revelation of
[1:02:41] Jesus Christ
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; and I will not question it
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; because I have tested everything else.
[1:02:49] I've seen what it says. There's a lot of
[1:02:51] things I don't understand, but I am
[1:02:53] willing to take it by faith.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? What is the calling? What is
[1:03:00] inside? Because you believe that by
[1:03:03] being washed by the water of the word,
[1:03:05] it's going to separate me from something
[1:03:07] that's going to have a promise in it
[1:03:10] that I will see Christ, the word made
[1:03:13] flesh in me.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; That's the Christ that is being revealed
[1:03:18] to me in this day. That's what John of
[1:03:21] our day was pointing me to. I believe
[1:03:24] that this message is the only thing that
[1:03:27] will allow me to see the word made flesh
[1:03:29] in me
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; which is Christ promised for this day.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; In this life and uh you know you and I
[1:03:39] grow up believing and trusting in
[1:03:41] systems of the world. We are educated by
[1:03:43] curriculums set by our government and
[1:03:46] and decided by leaders of our social
[1:03:49] systems in this world. We therefore have
[1:03:51] so much indoctrination of things and
[1:03:54] ideas of life and that are in direct
[1:03:56] opposition. There are you know this
[1:03:59] beautiful message brother preaches
[1:04:01] called uncertain sound where he says
[1:04:04] everything is uncertain. He talks about
[1:04:07] home life. You read it
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; politics education science everything is
[1:04:13] uncertain and the amount that is being
[1:04:16] pushed. Do you know in the prophet's day
[1:04:19] most the women were not educated
[1:04:22] which means most of the women were not
[1:04:23] going to argue with the word
[1:04:27] right most of the young people were not
[1:04:29] educated up to grade six
[1:04:33] brother Mary himself which means under
[1:04:36] that time most of those people were not
[1:04:38] going to use science education politics
[1:04:40] to argue with the word they would come
[1:04:42] in they would recognize the baptism of
[1:04:44] the Holy Ghost they would recognize the
[1:04:46] and accept it and follow and listen and
[1:04:49] adear to it and not what about this and
[1:04:52] what about this and what about that and
[1:04:54] what about this. Today we literally have
[1:04:56] young people who have not even learned
[1:05:00] anything yet in life arguing with a
[1:05:03] 60-year-old preacher as if they know
[1:05:05] more.
[1:05:10] It's incredible.
[1:05:13] You would even have young people in the
[1:05:16] message
[1:05:18] proving the prophet wrong
[1:05:21] about things in his time that they
[1:05:24] haven't lived in.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; I just want to say it. How stupid is
[1:05:32] that?
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; You haven't You were not there in World
[1:05:36] War II. You were not there when World
[1:05:38] War I was taking place. What do you
[1:05:40] know? You know what Wikipedia told you.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; You know what somebody else reported
[1:05:46] about what somebody else reported about
[1:05:48] what somebody else reported. And you
[1:05:50] say, "I got the links."
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; I got the source.
[1:05:54] Those sources were not even there.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Just because they they are in the
[1:06:00] internet with blue lines underneath
[1:06:01] doesn't mean it's the truth.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; You were not there.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:10] Oh, but there's documents.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Documents are written by people.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; People are liars by nature.
[1:06:25] People will do anything.
[1:06:28] Documents prove not. Oh, but there
[1:06:29] signatures. Come on. As if you've never
[1:06:33] seen signatures being forged. as if
[1:06:36] you've never seen signatures being put
[1:06:38] on something because they were coerced
[1:06:39] for something.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Is there if if you if you read uncertain
[1:06:46] sound, you'll know everything that looks
[1:06:49] like it's perfectly sound is uncertain.
[1:06:58] You know, when you have to when you have
[1:07:01] to come with backup
[1:07:04] and proof and stacks of papers and links
[1:07:08] and sources and then I know you're not
[1:07:12] sure.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; That's how not sure you are
[1:07:18] because you needed all that to be able
[1:07:20] to tell the truth. You didn't have the
[1:07:22] spirit to discern.
[1:07:27] You come. This is what this is what this
[1:07:29] is about. By the way, what I'm telling
[1:07:31] you is not relevant.
[1:07:33] The whole point of this is you are
[1:07:35] called to go to a world to tell them the
[1:07:38] word of God. In the time that you are
[1:07:40] speaking the word of God to another
[1:07:42] soul, what sources, links, and papers do
[1:07:46] you have?
[1:07:48] What proof do you have?
[1:07:52] If there isn't a consecrated life behind
[1:07:56] the words that you are speaking and a
[1:07:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost giving you
[1:08:01] utterance,
[1:08:02] you can have all the papers, all the
[1:08:04] books, all the quotes, all the
[1:08:06] scriptures. It's meaningless.
[1:08:10] That's what this is about. So I believe
[1:08:13] that the reason you know um at first
[1:08:16] when you you um you come to Christ and
[1:08:21] uh you know I what I mean try to do uh
[1:08:25] what the brother and I were
[1:08:27] fellowshipping about to try to make the
[1:08:28] word practical and real. Uh I would say
[1:08:32] it this way that Christianity and the
[1:08:35] message of the hour has become more of a
[1:08:37] hindrance to our human life and
[1:08:39] existence.
[1:08:41] If you listen to everything you are
[1:08:44] being fed by the world, by the media, by
[1:08:47] education, by science, by comforts of
[1:08:50] life, let's be honest, the message is a
[1:08:53] hindrance,
[1:08:56] right? I mean, we're living in Durban.
[1:08:58] By summer time, it's going to get
[1:09:00] blistering hot. Why do we have to dress
[1:09:02] like this? Why can't we just dress in
[1:09:06] barely any clothes? It'll be so much
[1:09:07] more comfortable.
[1:09:10] You know, why can't we just be casual?
[1:09:13] The message is so restrictive, you know?
[1:09:16] Why can't we just Why can't we just Why
[1:09:18] can't we just
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Come on. I We're living in the same
[1:09:22] world, aren't we? Yeah.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; Uh in a time where we've got all this
[1:09:26] entertainment, we've got all this music
[1:09:30] and movies and and shopping malls and
[1:09:34] and entertainment areas and holiday
[1:09:36] places to go blow our money on.
[1:09:40] Why can't we just do that?
[1:09:43] You know, have fun. Why can't we just do
[1:09:47] that? Why? Because we have been called
[1:09:48] to a purpose. What are we supposed to
[1:09:50] do? We just live boring lives stuck in
[1:09:52] our homes reading the Bible, reading the
[1:09:54] message. It feels so rest. It feels so
[1:09:57] wrong.
[1:10:02] And yet there were men who were called
[1:10:05] by the same purpose, who left all the
[1:10:08] entertainment they could have, who left
[1:10:11] all the lives they dreamed of. And you
[1:10:14] have an English Bible today because men
[1:10:17] took it seriously.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; You have message books printed in your
[1:10:24] languages because men before you took it
[1:10:26] seriously.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; They gave up entertainment. They gave up
[1:10:30] lives. They gave up families. They gave
[1:10:32] up time to get those books printed to
[1:10:35] get the word across the continents.
[1:10:38] And you sit here saying, "Uh, why can't
[1:10:41] we just go to the mall and spend time on
[1:10:44] holidays? And why can't we just be like
[1:10:46] other people? Why can't we just see
[1:10:50] that's what you need to get washed from?
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; That's the mentality. I'm not saying you
[1:10:59] can't go on holidays. I'm not saying you
[1:11:01] can't. Please, you there's days where I
[1:11:03] tell you you need holidays. We actually
[1:11:06] close services in December because I
[1:11:07] feel you need to go take time off with
[1:11:09] your family. I'm all for that. But as a
[1:11:13] believer, you must still come back to
[1:11:15] the thought that I'm called for a
[1:11:17] reason.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; You know, we ask you to find the
[1:11:20] balance. So at first, young people,
[1:11:24] you're coming to water baptism and the
[1:11:26] message feels restrictor. It feels
[1:11:27] oppressive. It even feels cumbersome.
[1:11:30] And we get the feeling like I'm I'm a
[1:11:33] good person.
[1:11:35] I can do well without the message.
[1:11:39] In fact, I don't even need to read the
[1:11:41] Bible. I'm really a good person. I can
[1:11:44] just come to the church and listen to
[1:11:46] the services. I mean, what's the point
[1:11:48] of studying it? What's the point of, you
[1:11:51] know, that other young brother in our
[1:11:54] church, you know, that fellow who
[1:11:56] recites the scriptures and knows it so
[1:11:58] well, that goody two shoes, you know, I
[1:12:01] know the author.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; That's the biggest excuse if I ever
[1:12:08] heard one.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; I know the author.
[1:12:15] I know the author. Do you know how much
[1:12:18] worth and value there is in the book?
[1:12:22] That the author actually wrote something
[1:12:24] for you to read
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; and you're just happy you know the
[1:12:29] author
[1:12:32] and that you're insulting him by not
[1:12:34] reading his book.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; Don't give me that excuse. Please read
[1:12:41] the book. If you present salvation to
[1:12:44] the world as an escape route from hell,
[1:12:47] then a lot of people come to be baptized
[1:12:50] out of fear.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And that's the reason I believe we have
[1:12:55] three kinds of believers in all the
[1:12:57] churches even in the message.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the majority of people are
[1:13:03] coming to the message because they're
[1:13:05] afraid.
[1:13:06] They've been coerced. They are going to
[1:13:09] do their best to comply with the
[1:13:11] religion and what it stipulates or what
[1:13:13] it demands. And it seems like the church
[1:13:16] with the strongest and harsher rules
[1:13:20] look like they are the safest because
[1:13:22] they are the strictest and they're going
[1:13:24] to do everything to keep me from going
[1:13:26] to hell.
[1:13:29] I believe that people are coerced into
[1:13:31] the message and Christianity
[1:13:34] because they are being convinced that
[1:13:37] they can uh they are being convinced
[1:13:40] about what they can get out of it.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; So in other words, you're not coming to
[1:13:47] be water baptized because you are more
[1:13:49] concerned with what you can get out of
[1:13:51] it.
[1:13:53] You are called for a purpose. And
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; if what you get out of it is to sit
[1:13:58] there and wait for someone to sit on me,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; that's what you are called for.
[1:14:06] See that? That's what this chair is.
[1:14:09] It's been selected for me to sit on.
[1:14:12] So it's not even about what you can get
[1:14:14] out of it. It's about what you can do
[1:14:17] for him.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; That's the thing. People are called to
[1:14:23] the message into Christianity. And and
[1:14:25] this is what evangelism of
[1:14:27] Pentecostalism was like. Are you born
[1:14:29] again? You come to a guy at the bus,
[1:14:32] he's enjoying reading his magazine,
[1:14:34] drinking a soda or something. And you
[1:14:37] come to him, poor guy is having a great
[1:14:38] day. Was not expecting you to arrive and
[1:14:41] ask him, "Are you born again?" And he
[1:14:43] said, "Oh, what do you mean born again?"
[1:14:46] And then you light up like a neon light.
[1:14:48] H
[1:14:50] you don't know what's being born again.
[1:14:51] Do you know there's a hell, my friend?
[1:14:54] Yeah, I live through it. I got a wife.
[1:14:56] You should meet her. You know, and then
[1:15:00] he's like, "No, no, no. There's a
[1:15:02] burning hell. There's a devil. There's a
[1:15:05] there's a end result. Do you know Jesus
[1:15:07] Christ?" "Yeah, I know Jesus Christ."
[1:15:10] Right now, while you're speaking to him,
[1:15:12] so far, you look like a mad man.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; But you're depending on your ability to
[1:15:19] scare him.
[1:15:21] into choosing Christ
[1:15:24] for what he can get out of it.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; And that's wrong.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; That may have worked for a time, but
[1:15:31] it's not going to work today. Cuz how
[1:15:33] long can you keep scaring somebody?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Eventually, someone watch the same
[1:15:38] horror movie, they know how to hide from
[1:15:40] the scary parts.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; After a while, they're not scared of it.
[1:15:46] For the life of me, I I listen to some
[1:15:48] people. I don't know what's the point.
[1:15:51] You know, they're terrified, but they're
[1:15:54] addicted to horror movies. I listen to
[1:15:57] them. I ask them, "What is your problem?
[1:16:00] You're terrified of it. Why do you keep
[1:16:02] watching it?" I don't know. It's like,
[1:16:04] "I've got to keep watching what I'm
[1:16:06] terrified of. You're insane."
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:11] You know? I I don't I don't understand.
[1:16:13] So, people agree. This is what I'm
[1:16:15] saying.
[1:16:16] Uh sorry for using that example but
[1:16:19] people seem to come to church to get
[1:16:22] terrified.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; The more they get terrified of hell and
[1:16:26] the bad thing going to happen to them,
[1:16:27] the more they'll stay.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And if you don't keep giving them a
[1:16:31] horror movie from the pullpit, then
[1:16:33] they're disappointed.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; They didn't get the adrenaline rush and
[1:16:37] the the dopamine, you know, I watched
[1:16:40] it, I face it, I'm terrified. Praise the
[1:16:43] Lord.
[1:16:48] Hell is scary. Demons, devils,
[1:16:50] superstition. Uh, you got to pray every
[1:16:53] day because the demons are going to get,
[1:16:55] the witches are going to come to me
[1:16:56] during the night. The wizards are going
[1:16:57] to cast spells on me. The more you can
[1:16:59] tell them, the more you can frighten
[1:17:00] them. What kind of life is that? That's
[1:17:04] not what you were called for. Amen.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; So, I think that was good for a time,
[1:17:11] the Pentecostal age, if I could say it
[1:17:13] this way, under John's baptism.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; It was good for a time under John's
[1:17:18] baptism because many people were needed
[1:17:21] under John's baptism to get the work to
[1:17:24] take the work and take it to the world,
[1:17:27] right? But it's going to take creating
[1:17:31] opportunities and funding which requires
[1:17:34] a lot of help from a lot of people. So
[1:17:37] that's what happened when you were
[1:17:39] scaring people into coming into the
[1:17:40] message. You needed their funding.
[1:17:44] You needed their help. You needed them
[1:17:46] the numbers to get the messaging out to
[1:17:48] the world. And then how many of them
[1:17:50] just fell away but they served their
[1:17:52] purpose.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The question is from all those
[1:17:57] saints, I want you to take a sober
[1:17:59] moment right now. From all those people
[1:18:01] who came in water baptism,
[1:18:04] how many actually repented of their
[1:18:06] individual beliefs
[1:18:09] and were willing to prepare their hearts
[1:18:11] to receive the open book?
[1:18:14] How many people were truly willing to
[1:18:17] give up their selfishness and their
[1:18:18] private ideologies of life to be part of
[1:18:21] Revelations 10:8-11?
[1:18:24] Yeah.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; To me, I I feel like we're still sitting
[1:18:27] around. Like Revelations 10:8-11 is like
[1:18:31] a like a bubble that's moving in front
[1:18:34] of us and we're waiting for something to
[1:18:36] happen.
[1:18:38] I still feel like there's like the
[1:18:39] stuper moving around message people and
[1:18:42] they we're just shouting about it and
[1:18:44] getting excited about it, but nothing's
[1:18:46] really happening yet. Like you haven't
[1:18:48] really gotten into it. You got water
[1:18:50] baptized, but Revelations 10:8-11 is
[1:18:52] only something to be excited about that
[1:18:54] God might do for me in the future.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; This tells us what baptism ought to be
[1:19:01] about. So, those of you wanting to be
[1:19:03] baptized,
[1:19:05] listen to these questions. Are you
[1:19:08] ready?
[1:19:10] Do you believe that the way of Christ is
[1:19:12] the only way that your life should be
[1:19:14] lived?
[1:19:18] Are you willing to give up any thoughts
[1:19:21] of a way of life without Christ?
[1:19:27] Are you willing to make that decision to
[1:19:29] follow the revealed word for the rest of
[1:19:33] your life such that there will be no
[1:19:37] conflict in your soul regarding the
[1:19:39] purpose of God that he has chosen you
[1:19:41] for? Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the highest morality
[1:19:47] in this world today is the word of God?
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that as a Christian it
[1:19:54] will be the greatest honor for your
[1:19:57] life?
[1:20:00] Do you believe that Christ came 2,000
[1:20:03] years ago and died to make a way for
[1:20:06] your sin to be forgiven?
[1:20:10] Will you believe that by believing his
[1:20:13] word it will do something supernatural
[1:20:15] to you that will clear you of all guilt,
[1:20:19] shame and unbelief that set you on a
[1:20:24] path of unrighteousness before and will
[1:20:27] now set you on a path of righteousness
[1:20:29] ahead?
[1:20:31] Do you believe that the word can do that
[1:20:33] for you?
[1:20:35] Yes.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that everything the Bible
[1:20:39] teaches is the truth of the word of God
[1:20:42] and nothing is above it?
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Are you willing to take the
[1:20:48] responsibility of believing the word
[1:20:50] knowing that you will be persecuted for
[1:20:52] it? Knowing that you will be teased,
[1:20:55] knowing that you will be mocked?
[1:20:58] Are you willing to take the
[1:20:59] responsibility of believing his word,
[1:21:02] not thinking of how it will benefit you,
[1:21:06] but how you will benefit it?
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; If you can choose this day that you can
[1:21:13] make this promise within yourself
[1:21:16] between you and God, then there's no
[1:21:18] time like the present.
[1:21:21] Take the step, express your faith and be
[1:21:24] water baptized
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; by faith. By faith means you are aware
[1:21:31] that there will be bad days,
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; bad times,
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; times of failure, times of stress, times
[1:21:41] of distress,
[1:21:42] times when family will let you down,
[1:21:45] times when church will let you down,
[1:21:47] times when people will let you down. But
[1:21:49] you will not fail in the promise you
[1:21:51] have made by faith. When you say you are
[1:21:55] doing it by faith means you are aware
[1:21:57] bad times are coming
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; and you will still stand. There will be
[1:22:03] days when you will struggle to
[1:22:05] understand some things in the word after
[1:22:08] you are water baptized.
[1:22:10] There will be days you will have
[1:22:12] personal problems, problems with family,
[1:22:14] with people in the message and the
[1:22:15] church. But you are still taking the
[1:22:18] step of faith promising that you will
[1:22:20] not fail to keep believing.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; You can only take the step if the word
[1:22:29] has already come to you.
[1:22:31] See, because it takes the washing of
[1:22:33] water by the word.
[1:22:36] And you can only take the step if the
[1:22:38] word has already caught your attention
[1:22:40] and has separated you from your thinking
[1:22:43] in your own mind.
[1:22:45] At this point, at this point, young
[1:22:48] people, if you want to be water
[1:22:49] baptized, at this point, I'm not even
[1:22:51] asking you if you love Jesus Christ yet.
[1:22:59] Because I know you don't.
[1:23:02] It's only a figment of your imagination.
[1:23:04] I'm telling you right now, I'm not even
[1:23:06] going to ask you, do you love Jesus
[1:23:08] Christ and make you lie to me?
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Because this is what it's about. You
[1:23:14] barely know him. His word has come to
[1:23:16] you and there's a calling on your heart
[1:23:18] and you know there's something that you
[1:23:20] can be and what you were is not what
[1:23:22] you're comfortable with anymore. That's
[1:23:24] what's happening. I'm not even going to
[1:23:26] ask you if you love him yet
[1:23:30] because so far I know you love yourself
[1:23:32] more.
[1:23:35] We are still moving. You when you come
[1:23:38] to water baptism you are still overcome
[1:23:40] with fileo love. You don't even have an
[1:23:43] ounce of agape yet. You're still coming
[1:23:46] to that.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; This is going to happen later. Loving
[1:23:52] him is going to happen later. You can
[1:23:54] love an idea.
[1:23:56] You can love the idea of Jesus Christ
[1:23:59] died for me on Calvary to forgive me of
[1:24:03] the wrongs that I did.
[1:24:06] And you can say, you can even cry, but
[1:24:08] you still don't love him yet.
[1:24:11] Trust me, there are days coming. It's
[1:24:13] going to prove whether you love it.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; This day is not that day.
[1:24:18] The day you get water baptism is not
[1:24:20] that day.
[1:24:22] That's you convincing yourself that you
[1:24:24] might love him. I'm telling you the
[1:24:27] truth. I was there.
[1:24:30] I was waterbaptized. But the day that
[1:24:32] the word really made, you know what,
[1:24:35] brother brother Albert Green was
[1:24:36] preaching last week when we were there.
[1:24:40] That was the revelation in my soul that
[1:24:43] turned me.
[1:24:45] When the impression of the word revealed
[1:24:48] to me that I was in him before the
[1:24:50] foundation of the world. That was the
[1:24:52] actual message that turned me. That
[1:24:54] turned the entire message for me. I
[1:24:57] remember that moment in my life. I lived
[1:24:59] in his message. I was baptized with
[1:25:01] message. I lived the life. I kept the
[1:25:03] rules. But the day when it turned, when
[1:25:06] I had that, you mean I was in him before
[1:25:09] the foundation of the world. And what's
[1:25:12] inside of me is a part of him. When that
[1:25:14] became real to me, the entire thing
[1:25:16] opened up.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; I can't say it's going to be the same
[1:25:18] for you young people. I can't say you
[1:25:20] will have the exact same experience. In
[1:25:21] fact, you might have a completely
[1:25:23] different experience. But you will know
[1:25:24] that
[1:25:28] you can only take the step if God has
[1:25:30] already caught your attention. So at
[1:25:33] this point
[1:25:35] it is the washing of the water by the
[1:25:36] word. It is water of baptism is the
[1:25:39] symbolic physical manifestation of this
[1:25:41] experience. When you so
[1:25:44] people can come and be baptized and I
[1:25:47] will baptize them in water. They'll go
[1:25:49] back. They'll leave the church and call
[1:25:51] me a devil. and I baptized them.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; They could still do that. So the act of
[1:25:58] being water baptized is not what does
[1:26:00] it. It's the washing of water by the
[1:26:02] word.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; The act of water baptism is something
[1:26:05] else. It's your outward confession.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That the word has come to you to
[1:26:11] separate you.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; Probably the best message to understand
[1:26:16] is all right. Are you ready for this? Uh
[1:26:19] the best message I would say and uh a
[1:26:22] lot of people in the message you know
[1:26:24] they start this reading this message and
[1:26:26] then they give up future home of the
[1:26:30] heavenly bridegroom and earthly bride.
[1:26:32] You know people today you know I'm sure
[1:26:35] you might know some people who don't
[1:26:36] like long preaching.
[1:26:42] You know messages like future home is
[1:26:45] long preaching. So you get to like page
[1:26:48] 15 and we're already giving up, you
[1:26:50] know.
[1:26:52] All right, let's go to future home. The
[1:26:54] first step is repentance towards God.
[1:26:58] And then follows after that is water
[1:27:01] baptism. Water of baptism, repent and be
[1:27:04] baptized in the name of Jesus. So he's
[1:27:06] saying water baptism follows repentance,
[1:27:11] right? Water of baptism follows showing
[1:27:14] that repentance was genuine. So you have
[1:27:16] to have repented. That means changed
[1:27:19] your mind.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; You have to have changed your thinking.
[1:27:24] And then what baptism follows. Water
[1:27:26] baptism shows that repentance was
[1:27:29] genuine
[1:27:32] or to remit our past sins. That has
[1:27:34] nothing to do with future sin.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Right? Are you listening young people?
[1:27:43] Are you listening?
[1:27:45] Water baptism remits past sin. Has
[1:27:49] nothing to do with future sin.
[1:27:52] That's telling you after you've been
[1:27:53] repented and water baptized, all that's
[1:27:56] happened is you cleared what you have
[1:27:57] already done. There's still stuff you
[1:28:00] are going to do.
[1:28:02] We're aware of that.
[1:28:05] It only remits. Repent and be baptized
[1:28:09] in the name of Jesus Christ. What for?
[1:28:11] Remission. Taking away of past sin has
[1:28:14] nothing to do with the future. Just your
[1:28:17] sin that you have done has been chopped
[1:28:19] off. What you did,
[1:28:22] you can't repent for what Adam done. You
[1:28:24] never done it. How can you repent for
[1:28:27] what other people did? Adam did it. You
[1:28:30] just get forgiveness for what you've
[1:28:32] done. The old nature is still there.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; This is what I'm saying. This message is
[1:28:42] what reveals everything to you. I would
[1:28:44] encourage you to go home, read it. If
[1:28:47] you parents have children who are
[1:28:49] knowledgeable teenagers, go through the
[1:28:51] message, this message with them. I'm
[1:28:54] give today I'm giving you the start
[1:28:56] because today two baptisms and three
[1:28:58] purgings is from this message.
[1:29:02] So this is telling you several things.
[1:29:04] We've already been through it.
[1:29:05] Repentance first, then water baptism,
[1:29:08] and then you must know all that happens
[1:29:10] is you are being cleared of things that
[1:29:13] you've done in the past. It has nothing
[1:29:15] to do with the future. You are still
[1:29:16] going to do stuff in the future.
[1:29:18] Probably the next day after you water
[1:29:20] baptized, too. Probably the next week,
[1:29:23] you are still going to do stuff. And for
[1:29:25] that, you are going to pay
[1:29:29] while you live.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[1:29:34] You are set free of all. This is a
[1:29:36] beautiful thing. You've done all the
[1:29:38] stuff in the past and it's chopped away.
[1:29:41] You're not paying for that. He's he's
[1:29:44] cleared you of all the guilt. But
[1:29:46] thereafter, everything you do because
[1:29:48] you were chosen to be holy.
[1:29:51] Everything you do that is against his
[1:29:54] purpose, you're going to pay for it. And
[1:29:57] thank God you're going to pay for it
[1:29:59] while you live.
[1:30:02] Because when you die, you get your crown
[1:30:04] of life in glory.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; And you're not going to pay for it in a
[1:30:09] lake of fire.
[1:30:13] Your past sins are remitted,
[1:30:16] not your future sins. And your slate is
[1:30:18] wiped clean. You are not held. This is
[1:30:22] what you are to be rejoicing. Especially
[1:30:24] some of you really live like real devils
[1:30:26] before,
[1:30:27] right? Let's be honest. If you did stuff
[1:30:31] that you should be held accountable for
[1:30:32] and Christ has wiped your slate clean,
[1:30:35] you should be whooping and screaming for
[1:30:38] joy.
[1:30:40] Thankful that I don't know who you
[1:30:41] really were before I met you.
[1:30:46] But it has nothing to do with the
[1:30:48] future. This is honest. I love this.
[1:30:50] This is so honest. There's nothing.
[1:30:52] Brother Brandham is not sugar coating
[1:30:53] it. He's not telling you, "Oh, your life
[1:30:55] is going to be wonderful from here on
[1:30:58] out. It's going to be awesome. No, it's
[1:31:00] got nothing. He's telling you so honest.
[1:31:02] Your old nature is still there.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Your future. This has got nothing to do
[1:31:07] with the future.
[1:31:10] Um, how are you going to be held
[1:31:12] accountable for future unrighteousness?
[1:31:15] That's where the church comes in.
[1:31:19] So, those of you who think, I can just
[1:31:20] listen to the tapes. I can just stay
[1:31:22] home. I can just I don't I can just, you
[1:31:25] know, read the own my own books. This is
[1:31:28] what the church is for. If you didn't
[1:31:30] know what the church is for, now I'm
[1:31:31] telling you. Now that I'm telling you
[1:31:33] and you know, you're accountable.
[1:31:36] Okay, I like saying that.
[1:31:40] We are commissioned by God to bind and
[1:31:43] loose.
[1:31:44] We have been given the power by God, all
[1:31:47] of us as a church to bind and loose.
[1:31:50] That means we are here to hold you
[1:31:53] accountable for your future mistakes,
[1:31:56] failures and errors. We are here to help
[1:31:59] you find judgment.
[1:32:02] We are here to help you find
[1:32:04] forgiveness.
[1:32:06] We are here to help you put all future
[1:32:09] mistakes and errors right.
[1:32:13] That's what we are all chosen for.
[1:32:15] That's why we are a body. A church that
[1:32:19] doesn't help you reconcile is not
[1:32:21] fulfilling its purpose. A church that
[1:32:24] doesn't bring you to forgiveness and
[1:32:26] back to full value is not fulfilling its
[1:32:28] purpose. What purpose? To bind and
[1:32:31] loose, to judge, to legislate, to
[1:32:35] administer grace.
[1:32:37] So you were baptized in water. Your past
[1:32:40] sins were forgiven. It was remitted. We
[1:32:43] don't even think about it. We don't hold
[1:32:44] it against you. Nobody does. It's your
[1:32:47] conscience is clear but everything you
[1:32:49] do thereafter you have us to reckon
[1:32:51] with.
[1:32:53] God has purposed it that you have us to
[1:32:55] reckon with. If you hide things from us
[1:32:58] we can't do anything. If you confess it
[1:33:00] we can do something. We can bring you to
[1:33:03] repentance. We can bring you back to
[1:33:05] your full value. That's what we are here
[1:33:07] for.
[1:33:09] It is important to know this. When you
[1:33:11] get baptized, young people, when you get
[1:33:13] baptized, you must have full confidence
[1:33:17] in Brother L and your church that if you
[1:33:20] do something wrong, if you mess up your
[1:33:22] lives, we are here to help you. Do not
[1:33:24] be ashamed. Do not feel afraid of us. If
[1:33:27] you can't tell us, who can you tell?
[1:33:31] Where else are you going to find grace?
[1:33:34] Where else are there people who will
[1:33:36] still accept you for the mistakes you
[1:33:38] make?
[1:33:40] who will still have you to fellowship
[1:33:42] among us, share the word with us. Where
[1:33:44] else will you find people who will not
[1:33:46] look at your sin and accept you as a
[1:33:48] soul moving along with us to this
[1:33:50] glorious body change?
[1:33:53] Where else will you find people your own
[1:33:56] spouse will speak against you? Your
[1:33:58] children will will revile you. Your
[1:34:00] cousins, your families, they'll all hold
[1:34:02] you and and say you're a hypocrite.
[1:34:04] We'll never do that.
[1:34:07] And yet we'll tell you, brother, sister,
[1:34:09] you need to make it right. We'll tell
[1:34:11] you this is the right thing to do. You
[1:34:13] have to confess it. You have to face up
[1:34:14] to it. We'll tell you the right thing to
[1:34:17] do here is face the music, but we'll
[1:34:19] stand with you. We're here with you.
[1:34:22] It's going to be hard. It's going to be
[1:34:24] tough. They're going to hate you. But
[1:34:25] we're here with you. Know that God
[1:34:27] doesn't hate you. God's not against you.
[1:34:29] We're here for you, young people. If you
[1:34:31] falter after you water baptize, we're
[1:34:33] here for you.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:36] You have a promise from us. As long as
[1:34:39] you stay with the word, we cannot throw
[1:34:41] you away.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:44] [Music]
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; But you've got to put the work in.
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; You've got to come to church. You've got
[1:34:52] to read the gospel. You've got to become
[1:34:54] tougher in the word, stronger in the
[1:34:57] revelation.
[1:34:58] Amen. You've got to show care for your
[1:35:00] other people because you are also going
[1:35:02] to be a part of it when other people
[1:35:04] falter. You have to be there for them.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Your old nature is still there. That's
[1:35:12] why you may still fall into snares and
[1:35:15] cause serious failures somewhere in your
[1:35:17] journey in your life after you are water
[1:35:19] baptized. It's not a magic moment. It is
[1:35:24] to some degree.
[1:35:26] Amen. I I tell you, every person who who
[1:35:28] has been through the water of baptism,
[1:35:30] you come out with an amazing feeling. I
[1:35:32] won't take that away from you. It's
[1:35:34] amazing, right? And there's so much of
[1:35:38] And the most amazing is all these people
[1:35:40] looking at you
[1:35:42] so happy for you. And you're walking
[1:35:44] out, you're drenched, you look like a
[1:35:46] bedraggled wet dog, you know, you come
[1:35:49] out of the water, you're sheepish,
[1:35:50] you're pulling your clothes on you, they
[1:35:52] put a towel around, they're singing
[1:35:53] songs, they're so praising God, her soul
[1:35:56] has been brought into heaven, and you're
[1:35:58] walking through there.
[1:36:00] Saints, the feeling is amazing
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; because these you've just been inducted
[1:36:05] into the body of these people. These
[1:36:07] people are so happy you're one of them.
[1:36:13] Brings us to a very important point.
[1:36:16] Being baptized in the right name. Let's
[1:36:19] read a quote from future home of the
[1:36:21] heavenly bridegroom. Paragraph 111.
[1:36:23] Future home.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Mson, are you still listening?
[1:36:26] Listen carefully. See, the heart has to
[1:36:29] be cleansed like that. Before God can
[1:36:33] come down in the person of the Holy
[1:36:35] Ghost, which is Christ coming down and
[1:36:37] dwell in the human heart, it must it
[1:36:40] first must be repented. Are you
[1:36:41] listening?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; It must be baptized in water in his name
[1:36:47] to show who it belongs to.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; So, you're not going to escape water
[1:36:54] baptism, young people.
[1:36:56] When you do it, it shows who your heart
[1:37:00] belongs to.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; Being water baptized is showing who your
[1:37:06] heart belongs to. What does that mean?
[1:37:08] There's so many beautiful nuggets of
[1:37:10] statements in the message that I can
[1:37:12] read to you. There's thousands. I just
[1:37:14] don't have the time to do that. But what
[1:37:16] does it mean that who your heart belongs
[1:37:18] to, you know? Almost like when you give
[1:37:21] an engagement ring to a young girl or
[1:37:24] she gives one to you, you know,
[1:37:25] whatever, vice versa.
[1:37:28] And she walks around or he walks around
[1:37:30] with that ring on their finger. That's a
[1:37:32] token that I belong to someone else.
[1:37:35] You see that? That's what your baptism
[1:37:39] is. You It's your token to God to say,
[1:37:43] "I belong to you. You belong to me." It
[1:37:48] shows who your heart. There must be an
[1:37:50] expression to say who my heart belongs
[1:37:52] to.
[1:37:54] Are you with me?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; You know, as children who grew up in the
[1:37:57] message, you still with me?
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; We saw our parents make a big deal about
[1:38:02] being baptized in the name of Jesus,
[1:38:05] right? How many of you here had parents
[1:38:07] in the message?
[1:38:10] Raise your hand. Don't be afraid. I only
[1:38:12] bite on Fridays.
[1:38:14] Okay,
[1:38:16] I'm just kidding. Uh so you know you've
[1:38:20] had parents in the message
[1:38:22] you remember the times where your
[1:38:24] parents talked about being baptized in
[1:38:26] the name of Jesus and father son and
[1:38:28] holy ghost and trinity versus wonders
[1:38:29] and you remember that the there was this
[1:38:32] great hype about that right and uh you
[1:38:35] can't be the trinitarian way and the
[1:38:37] name of the father the name of the son
[1:38:39] the name of the holy ghost it was the
[1:38:40] name of Jesus and they made a big deal
[1:38:42] about that it was good enough for a time
[1:38:45] because it was a traditional thing to do
[1:38:47] to draw people into the bride church
[1:38:50] away from denominational systems. It was
[1:38:52] great. But today you are called to a
[1:38:56] capstone. You need to get a deeper
[1:38:59] understanding of the name.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; It's no longer just about not trinity
[1:39:04] versus oneness or that the name Jesus is
[1:39:07] it's no longer just that. It's a deeper
[1:39:10] meaning. I'm just going to say it. Unto
[1:39:13] what were you baptized?
[1:39:16] Those
[1:39:18] of you then that were unto what then
[1:39:20] were you baptized? Didn't Paul ask that
[1:39:23] of those people? And they said unto
[1:39:25] John's baptism.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Right? So this is the question that
[1:39:31] fixed why they didn't have the Holy
[1:39:34] Ghost.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Sure. Amen.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; He said to them, "Why have you not
[1:39:37] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:39:39] believed? Unto what then were you
[1:39:42] baptized?"
[1:39:43] So in other words, that's saying, why
[1:39:46] are you not effective in the purpose of
[1:39:49] the open book today?
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask it this way. Are were
[1:39:55] you baptized until God sent a prophet?
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Were you baptized until seven seal not
[1:40:03] open?
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Because that's going to explain why you
[1:40:06] don't have the Holy Ghost for today.
[1:40:08] Yeah.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; Why you are ineffectual in your life in
[1:40:12] the open book? Because you are still
[1:40:14] baptized unto a name of another day.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; You have to ask yourself these questions
[1:40:23] because that determines what purpose you
[1:40:27] were baptized into. See, being baptized
[1:40:30] in the name of Jesus must not be a
[1:40:33] tradition. The name of Jesus represents.
[1:40:37] How many of you know what Jesus actually
[1:40:39] means? Right? I'm not talking. We're
[1:40:41] still going to get to that in the name
[1:40:42] of of God. We spoke about Jesus meaning
[1:40:45] Jehovah, our savior. But what is what is
[1:40:48] the concept of Jesus?
[1:40:50] What is the concept of the word made
[1:40:52] flesh? What is the mystery of Christ
[1:40:55] revealed?
[1:40:59] It is Jesus encapsulates this. The
[1:41:03] revelation of God made flesh.
[1:41:09] Let it sink in.
[1:41:11] Are you So, I'm going to say it this
[1:41:12] way. Are you baptized in the name of the
[1:41:17] revelation of God made flesh?
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Are you committed to that name? That you
[1:41:24] believe that the word can be made flesh?
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you, if you believe the
[1:41:31] word can be made flesh, then you believe
[1:41:33] you can be the word made flesh. And you
[1:41:35] believe you can be the revelation of
[1:41:38] God.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; And then if that if you have that
[1:41:42] belief, you can believe that your
[1:41:44] brother can be.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; That someone else out there can be that.
[1:41:48] And then you're you're ignited with a
[1:41:50] fire to tell someone you can be the
[1:41:53] revelation of God made flesh.
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; That is the name of Jesus.
[1:42:02] You must believe unto that name. You
[1:42:03] know saints when we preach messages from
[1:42:06] this pulpit and whenever we are we say
[1:42:10] things we read quotes we read scriptures
[1:42:12] but we're expecting you to get it. We're
[1:42:14] expecting the people to get it. Instead
[1:42:16] we get tied down with ministers being
[1:42:18] legalistic about quotes and and that's
[1:42:21] not what we're talking about.
[1:42:24] We believe this. We know what Jesus is.
[1:42:29] &gt;&gt; We know what it means for you to be
[1:42:31] Jesus. Yes,
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; you can shout about Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[1:42:38] Praise be to God. My new name and that's
[1:42:40] all you have is a slogan.
[1:42:45] &gt;&gt; That is the name you must know. You
[1:42:48] young people, what are you being
[1:42:50] baptized into?
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; The revelation of God made flesh.
[1:42:57] The revealing of the creator.
[1:43:01] the revealing of the logos of God made
[1:43:06] flesh. You are being baptized unto that.
[1:43:10] You are going to be giving up your life
[1:43:12] for the purpose of that revealing.
[1:43:15] You are you are being baptized as a
[1:43:18] confession to give up your lives as a
[1:43:21] purpose of becoming that to show others
[1:43:24] that they can become that.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:29] That means do you believe that the
[1:43:32] revelation of God is the word made flesh
[1:43:34] in Jesus?
[1:43:37] Do you believe that?
[1:43:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; If you can believe that by faith
[1:43:43] in that name,
[1:43:45] then the next step is leading you to the
[1:43:48] purpose of you becoming the word made
[1:43:50] flesh. Right? and and and so which is
[1:43:54] the purpose of God that he made man in
[1:43:56] the beginning which Adam lost.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go to the baptism of
[1:44:03] the Holy Ghost and fire.
[1:44:06] So
[1:44:08] because I purposed more to speak on
[1:44:10] water baptism, you know, this shouldn't
[1:44:12] take too long. Although this is a
[1:44:14] massive subject which I cannot do in the
[1:44:17] service. I I just shared recently with
[1:44:19] some folks my questions from 2012. There
[1:44:22] were like 30 some odd questions on the
[1:44:25] Holy Ghost. Some of you might have even
[1:44:27] forgotten the questions you gave me.
[1:44:31] Some of you, if I even mentioned one,
[1:44:32] you'll ask me, "Brother, please can you
[1:44:34] preach that series again?"
[1:44:37] Like question I got, how could a baby
[1:44:42] receive be filled with the Holy Ghost?
[1:44:44] John the Baptist in the womb.
[1:44:50] H see we did those questions we did the
[1:44:56] answers to those questions and I bet you
[1:44:58] some of you will be saying
[1:45:01] where's I want those notes
[1:45:04] please can you preach that again those
[1:45:06] are the the the amount of questions we
[1:45:08] had in the Holy Ghost that we dealt with
[1:45:10] from 2012
[1:45:11] and we did this series for you we
[1:45:13] preached it in different ways too there
[1:45:16] about 30 odd questions.
[1:45:19] So, the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:45:21] massive subject. At first, when you read
[1:45:25] this
[1:45:27] uh the baptism, right? You take uh
[1:45:30] sorry, we I don't think we're going to
[1:45:31] the quotes yet. Okay.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire,
[1:45:36] right? So, when John the Baptist said he
[1:45:38] will come and he will baptize you with
[1:45:40] the Holy Ghost and fire. Are you still
[1:45:42] with me? Don't worry about the screen.
[1:45:46] Doesn't it sound a little like there's a
[1:45:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost and baptism of
[1:45:51] fire?
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; It says he I baptize you with water. He
[1:45:55] will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and
[1:45:57] fire. So it can sound like two, right?
[1:46:00] Two different baptisms. Baptism of the
[1:46:02] Holy Ghost and a baptism of fire. The
[1:46:04] there are two scriptures, one in
[1:46:06] Matthew, one in Luke that says it
[1:46:08] exactly the same way. If it were not for
[1:46:10] the prophet, we would uh not be able to
[1:46:13] understand this properly. The baptism of
[1:46:15] the Holy Ghost is a phenomenon that has
[1:46:18] been questioned and taught for 2,000
[1:46:20] years
[1:46:22] and it was even a point where they
[1:46:24] kicked it out of the church because it
[1:46:26] was creating so much of trouble. The
[1:46:28] clue, are you with me?
[1:46:31] The clue is the word baptism.
[1:46:35] Why? Because we already know what
[1:46:37] baptism of water is, right? So the clue
[1:46:40] is baptism because what is baptism? The
[1:46:43] word baptism comes from the word
[1:46:45] baptismal which means washing or dipping
[1:46:49] or immersing.
[1:46:51] Are you with me? So if you are going to
[1:46:54] be washed, dipped or immersed with the
[1:46:58] Holy Ghost and with fire,
[1:47:02] right? So what then is the Holy Ghost
[1:47:04] and fire that you are being dipped into?
[1:47:07] What are you what is the Holy Ghost that
[1:47:09] you are being washed in? What is the
[1:47:11] fire that you are being washed in?
[1:47:14] Because it says in Acts 2 uh
[1:47:16] Pentecostalism rather uh is responsible
[1:47:19] for a lot of the confusion and the
[1:47:21] romanticism of the Holy Ghost. Do you
[1:47:23] know why? Because they kind of thought
[1:47:25] you remember in Acts two it says and
[1:47:26] there appeared unto them cloven tongues
[1:47:28] of fire.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Remember that? And so they thought that
[1:47:31] that's the fire that they were baptized
[1:47:33] with. But how do we know that's not
[1:47:35] true? Because there are many other
[1:47:37] people after Acts two received the Holy
[1:47:39] Ghost who never claimed to see cloven
[1:47:41] tongues of fire.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; So do they have the Holy Ghost but not
[1:47:44] the fire?
[1:47:46] Right? So they also hold the
[1:47:49] Pentecostals hold people to a standard
[1:47:52] of seeing tongues of fire. Some of them
[1:47:54] do. And if not, if you don't, if you say
[1:47:57] you got the Holy Ghost, you spoke with
[1:47:58] tongue, but you didn't have tongues of
[1:48:00] fire, then you have a problem. There was
[1:48:02] no other record of other people receive
[1:48:05] or seeing tongues of fire in the Bible.
[1:48:08] And it's important to understand what
[1:48:10] the Holy Ghost is to know what it is
[1:48:12] that you are baptized with. Are you all
[1:48:14] with me?
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; Okay. So,
[1:48:18] if we had to put it in a way that we can
[1:48:20] understand, break it down to reality,
[1:48:22] brother L. Okay. It would be that you
[1:48:25] will be baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:48:29] mixed with fire. Not two separate
[1:48:32] baptisms. Again,
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; you got water baptism and you got bapti
[1:48:36] baptism with the Holy Ghost mixed with
[1:48:39] fire. Hold that thought. What are you
[1:48:41] talking about?
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; The fire is not real fire. It's not
[1:48:45] seven-dimensional fire. Uh it it it what
[1:48:49] brother Bam identifies in the message as
[1:48:52] zeal. Amen.
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Zeal. Fire is zeal. Brother man
[1:48:58] identifies. He says it's like when you
[1:49:00] are baptized with the Holy Ghost, it
[1:49:02] sets you on fire.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Right. It meaning it places a zeal in
[1:49:07] you to spread the word of God.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; It places a zeal in you for salvation of
[1:49:14] souls. Amen.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Now, a lot of people
[1:49:19] are baptized with the emotions.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; And then they sit.
[1:49:28] There's no zeal.
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Listen, what is baptism? It's a washing.
[1:49:34] It's a cleansing.
[1:49:37] You are cleansed by zeal.
[1:49:40] A lot of people, you know, when we we
[1:49:42] talk about purpose from the pulpit and
[1:49:44] we tell you you have to have a purpose
[1:49:47] and when we tell young people if you
[1:49:49] want to overcome sins of the modern day,
[1:49:51] pornography, social media, all of that,
[1:49:54] what what is the real It's so logical.
[1:49:56] What is the real problem? You are stuck
[1:49:59] sitting on your phones. You have no
[1:50:01] purpose. You are doing nothing with your
[1:50:04] life but filling your head with what you
[1:50:06] see on the internet. You're spending
[1:50:08] hours and hours and hours on the
[1:50:09] internet and the the purging of that is
[1:50:14] purpose.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Now, where do you get purpose from? Now,
[1:50:20] here's the the trial of this day, you
[1:50:23] young people and adults stuck in social
[1:50:26] media and the and the internet,
[1:50:29] that thing is holding you back
[1:50:32] from becoming a guitarist,
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; a pianist.
[1:50:37] an artist, a reader,
[1:50:41] an engineer,
[1:50:43] a nuclear physicist, you're literally
[1:50:46] becoming stupid by putting more
[1:50:48] knowledge into you.
[1:50:52] And what knowledge? Irrelevant
[1:50:54] knowledge.
[1:50:56] You will waste hours and hours in a day
[1:51:00] wasting this time putting other stuff in
[1:51:03] your head that has absolutely nothing to
[1:51:06] do with the purpose of God.
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; But this is the challenge of this day.
[1:51:11] This is what you are going through.
[1:51:13] Right? And so
[1:51:16] if if you if you don't even have a cell
[1:51:18] phone, right?
[1:51:21] You don't have a cell phone, you don't
[1:51:22] have internet, but you have TV and
[1:51:24] you're on TV all the time, then it's the
[1:51:27] same thing. If you don't have that and
[1:51:29] you have something else. If it's your
[1:51:31] work,
[1:51:34] if you're obsessed with your job, it's
[1:51:37] the same story. If you're obsessed with
[1:51:39] your career, it's the same story. Why?
[1:51:42] You are being absorbed into something.
[1:51:45] Where is the zeal for souls while you're
[1:51:49] obsessed with that?
[1:51:53] So you can have a holy ghost feeling,
[1:51:56] emotion, anointing, but no zeal.
[1:52:04] Zeal is what cleanses you. Zeal is the
[1:52:08] fire.
[1:52:10] Zeal is what purges.
[1:52:13] Zeal is what removes those specks of
[1:52:15] impurities inside that you can't see
[1:52:17] that cracks the gold.
[1:52:21] You are supposed to be baptized. So this
[1:52:24] is the thing. What what am I supposed to
[1:52:27] do, brother L? What? So now like with
[1:52:30] our children, if we don't provide the
[1:52:33] purpose, they'll just sit there.
[1:52:39] We must make up the the chore list.
[1:52:43] There's grass that must be raped.
[1:52:45] There's the patio that must be swept.
[1:52:47] There's the pool that must be clean. I
[1:52:49] must set the time. I must set this. I'm
[1:52:51] You won't do it. You'll walk over the
[1:52:54] filth in the floor. You'll bypass my car
[1:52:57] that's looking filthy and won't wash it.
[1:53:00] You won't do it. You'll spend time on
[1:53:02] your cell phone and not be interested
[1:53:04] because you don't have any zeal to make
[1:53:07] yourself better. Just go wash your dad's
[1:53:11] car and find out how useless you are
[1:53:13] even washing a car.
[1:53:16] You will leave stains on the windows.
[1:53:20] You will leave soap suds on certain air.
[1:53:23] You'll wet my seats.
[1:53:26] You're if you can't even wash a car, but
[1:53:29] you want to save souls,
[1:53:32] why can't you wash a car? Cuz you don't
[1:53:33] do it enough.
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; You don't know how to take stains off a
[1:53:39] car window
[1:53:40] and make it gleam. You don't know how to
[1:53:43] use polish on the wheels. You You don't
[1:53:46] know how to do anything unless I tell
[1:53:47] you what to do.
[1:53:49] &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz you don't do it.
[1:53:53] And this is the issue with church
[1:53:54] people. You're waiting for me to tell
[1:53:56] you
[1:53:58] what's wrong with your mouth. Your mouth
[1:54:00] is good at it other places and other
[1:54:02] times.
[1:54:03] [Music]
[1:54:04] Times we don't need it.
[1:54:08] What's What's wrong? Why can't you tell
[1:54:10] other people of your love for the word?
[1:54:13] What's stopping you? Nothing. You've got
[1:54:15] an excuse. You're waiting for the church
[1:54:17] to make a timetable.
[1:54:19] You're waiting waiting for the church to
[1:54:21] make a program.
[1:54:23] You've got zeal. You You've got gifts.
[1:54:26] You've got abilities. The Holy Ghost has
[1:54:28] given you abilities. You lacking zeal.
[1:54:32] And zeal is what cleanses.
[1:54:36] Zeal is what removes the idle mind. Zeal
[1:54:40] is what removes idolatry. Zeal is what
[1:54:43] removes complacency.
[1:54:48] Don't wait for a child. It's not going
[1:54:50] to happen. Church programs can only do
[1:54:52] so much. You literally work with people.
[1:54:57] You literally work with souls. You
[1:54:59] literally school with souls. You
[1:55:02] literally shop where there are souls.
[1:55:04] You are all over the place with souls
[1:55:06] you can speak to.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; You despise the Jehovah's Witness. He's
[1:55:11] doing a lot more than you.
[1:55:16] This is what Holy Ghost and zeal is.
[1:55:20] This is why people are still tossed
[1:55:23] about. This is why people cannot
[1:55:25] overcome things in their lives. You're
[1:55:28] sitting around and claiming to have the
[1:55:31] open book and eating the open book and
[1:55:34] it's sweet in the mouth, bit in the
[1:55:35] belly, but you're not fulfilling
[1:55:37] prophesying to many kindreds, nations,
[1:55:39] tribes, and
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; doubts. Amen.
[1:55:42] What is the Holy Ghost? We know that the
[1:55:44] Holy Ghost is the spirit, the divine
[1:55:46] nature of God that has ordained to be a
[1:55:48] part of man. Let's read. You want to
[1:55:51] know question and answers. And you take
[1:55:53] the Holy Spirit off of a man, he's lower
[1:55:55] than an animal. He's worse than an
[1:55:57] animal. That's a hard thing to say, but
[1:55:59] you take a man that's unregenerated in
[1:56:02] his mind without the Holy Spirit to
[1:56:04] direct his thoughts.
[1:56:09] Don't tell me you don't need the Holy
[1:56:10] Ghost. What a baptism is not enough.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; This is why every prophet, every holy
[1:56:16] man in the Old Testament had to be
[1:56:18] anointed by the Holy Ghost because he
[1:56:20] had to be able to prophesy. You cannot
[1:56:22] prophesy without the Holy Ghost. You
[1:56:25] cannot prophesy true.
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; But this Holy Ghost anointing that they
[1:56:32] had in the Old Testament is not the same
[1:56:35] anointing in the New Testament.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't care how many people
[1:56:41] disagree on that. There's thousands of
[1:56:43] quotes to prove you wrong. The prophet
[1:56:46] explains us explicitly
[1:56:50] for those you know how much of attack
[1:56:52] we've come under because I've made those
[1:56:54] statements and yet just the legalism
[1:56:57] over two quotes
[1:56:59] that where brother man said they're the
[1:57:01] self same thing the cells same word and
[1:57:04] yet if you read the token message and
[1:57:07] everywhere else he said they were under
[1:57:10] the blood of bulls and goats
[1:57:12] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; and the blood cell could not break and
[1:57:15] take the life of the animal to come
[1:57:16] back.
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; He said only after Christ,
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; the blood cell broke and the life of
[1:57:21] Christ could come back upon the
[1:57:23] believer. That token is the Holy Ghost.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; If that came after Christ, what did they
[1:57:28] have in the Old Testament?
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Sir,
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; you know those quotes, but you get
[1:57:34] legalistic about two quotes.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; There's hundreds of them and they know
[1:57:41] that.
[1:57:43] Therefore, they may have been anointed
[1:57:45] with the Holy Ghost anointing, but there
[1:57:48] was an absolute difference before Christ
[1:57:50] and after Christ. Yes, sir.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; I don't care what they say.
[1:57:54] Before Acts chapter 2, listen carefully.
[1:57:56] John 20 22-23.
[1:57:59] And when he had said this, he breathed
[1:58:00] on them and said, this is before Acts
[1:58:03] chapter 2.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; When he had said this, he breathed on
[1:58:06] them said, "Receive you the Holy Ghost."
[1:58:09] I literally told them, I read the
[1:58:12] scripture that said David spake by the
[1:58:14] Holy Ghost saying, "My Lord said unto
[1:58:16] the Lord said unto my Lord." I know
[1:58:19] that. I know they were anointed with the
[1:58:22] Holy Ghost. But it's very evident what
[1:58:24] they had was not the same as what they
[1:58:26] had after Christ.
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; Because there was no blood cell broken
[1:58:31] yet.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:58:34] But here before Acts chapter 2, he tells
[1:58:36] him,
[1:58:38] "Receive you the Holy Ghost. Whoever
[1:58:40] sins you remit is remitted. Whose sins
[1:58:42] you retain is retained."
[1:58:45] He, this was before Acts two. What was
[1:58:48] the Holy Ghost given to them for that
[1:58:50] purpose? Go and remit and retain sins.
[1:58:55] After acts two was go take the gospel to
[1:58:58] the world. Amen.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Now you have the the blood cell, the
[1:59:03] life
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; of the blood. And you can do this,
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; totally different anointing, totally
[1:59:10] different purpose.
[1:59:12] But with the Holy Ghost, we have today,
[1:59:14] we have this purpose and every other
[1:59:17] purpose that they had in the Old
[1:59:18] Testament. Everything.
[1:59:22] Amen.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; This was before Acts 2. So before Acts
[1:59:27] 2, they were just anointed for a small
[1:59:29] purpose. Go and remit sins. Go and
[1:59:31] retain sins. Every man of the Old
[1:59:34] Testament went through this. I've
[1:59:37] already given you examples of Moses,
[1:59:38] Samson, David, right? They were only
[1:59:41] like for example, Samson had the Holy
[1:59:44] Ghost to go and kill Philistines, tear
[1:59:48] open a lion, be strong, carry the gates
[1:59:52] of Gaza, kill a thousand with a jawbone
[1:59:54] of an ass. But then
[1:59:57] as soon as the purpose was over, it was
[1:59:59] gone.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; It literally was in the bedroom of a of
[2:00:04] a harlot.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; When she he went to sleep, she tied up
[2:00:08] his hair and then Samson, the
[2:00:10] Philistines are upon you. The spirit of
[2:00:12] the Lord comes upon him in the room of a
[2:00:14] harlot and he wakes up and then goes
[2:00:17] chasing after the Philistines. You try
[2:00:19] that today.
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:00:25] So it tells you the anointing of the
[2:00:27] Holy Ghost can fall on anyone to make
[2:00:29] them do a purpose for God that God deems
[2:00:32] necessary. But this does not mean that
[2:00:35] they have the person indwelling them or
[2:00:38] the full true baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:42] Holy Ghost has always been about God
[2:00:45] giving ability
[2:00:48] to men. So you must be baptized with
[2:00:51] ability and zeal.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Got it.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Ghost? It's the ability
[2:00:59] of God for a purpose.
[2:01:02] It's the divine you. It's it's given you
[2:01:05] ability and a gift that you cannot get
[2:01:07] on your own.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; You with me?
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Acts 1 7 to8. And he said unto them, it
[2:01:13] is not for you to know the times of
[2:01:14] season which the p which the father had
[2:01:16] put in his own power. Yes.
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; But you shall receive power.
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; Those are two different words. The one
[2:01:24] power means authority. The other power
[2:01:27] is dunamis. Right? After that the Holy
[2:01:30] Ghost has come upon you. Sorry. One
[2:01:32] power is uh is authority. The other one
[2:01:34] is ability.
[2:01:36] You will receive ability. After that the
[2:01:38] Holy Ghost has come upon you. Ability
[2:01:40] for what? You shall be witnesses unto me
[2:01:43] in Jerusalem, in Judea, in Samaria, and
[2:01:45] unto the uttermost part of the world.
[2:01:48] Amen.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; You could not be witnesses before
[2:01:50] Christ's death and resurrection.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of course, that ability comprises
[2:01:58] many different attributes, but God knows
[2:02:01] what is necessary. In other words,
[2:02:02] there's so many attributes in God. You
[2:02:04] won't be uh baptized with the ability to
[2:02:07] build an ark out here in the parking lot
[2:02:09] today.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; You won't be uh um given the ability to
[2:02:13] open up the Red Sea today. There's no
[2:02:15] need for it.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There's a lot of things that
[2:02:18] there's no need for but there's a need
[2:02:21] today and you need the Holy Ghost for
[2:02:24] that need to meet the challenge of the
[2:02:25] hour. John 7:37-39
[2:02:28] in the last day that great day of the
[2:02:30] feast Jesus stood and cried saying if
[2:02:32] any man thirst let him come unto me and
[2:02:34] drink. Are you listening?
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; He that believeth on me as the scripture
[2:02:37] said out of his belly shall flow rivers
[2:02:39] of living water. We write songs about
[2:02:41] it. We shout about it. We quote the
[2:02:44] scripture. Out of his belly shall flow
[2:02:46] rivers of living water. What does it
[2:02:48] mean? The next scripture tells you this
[2:02:50] speaking of the spirit which they
[2:02:53] believe they that believe on him should
[2:02:55] receive for the Holy Ghost was not given
[2:02:57] yet. The Holy Ghost has got to do with
[2:03:00] out of your belly flowing rivers of
[2:03:02] living water.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; What is that water? The water of
[2:03:07] separation.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; You are given the commission to go and
[2:03:13] separate people.
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; I hope you can get that. The Lord Jesus
[2:03:22] talking about people thirsting. Let him
[2:03:24] that is a thirst come unto me. What's
[2:03:26] his thirsting? There are desperate
[2:03:28] people out there. People are desperate
[2:03:30] to hear the word of God. People are
[2:03:32] suffering in ignorance and under false
[2:03:34] religions and traditions. He promised
[2:03:36] his disciples they would receive the
[2:03:39] answer for thirsty people
[2:03:42] and it would come out in abundance.
[2:03:46] Amen. This is what I find shocking. You
[2:03:49] know being purported by ministers today
[2:03:52] who are trying to revive the age of
[2:03:53] Pentecost. The prophet as much as said
[2:03:57] that they may have had a baptism of the
[2:03:59] Holy Ghost but they did not have a true
[2:04:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:04:04] You know that there are quotes on that.
[2:04:06] Let's read it.
[2:04:08] If there's a false, if there's a baptism
[2:04:11] of the Holy Ghost and there's a true
[2:04:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost, that means
[2:04:13] there's a false one.
[2:04:16] Look at this. Pentecost. Pentecost. Pass
[2:04:18] thy thinking through God's filter, not
[2:04:21] your denominational dreams, and you will
[2:04:23] come out with a holy man's taste. The
[2:04:25] true baptism of the Holy Ghost. There's
[2:04:30] other places Leodysia has enjoyed
[2:04:33] anointings of the Holy Ghost saints.
[2:04:34] Pentecost has enjoyed anointings and
[2:04:37] they were able to abuse it and they did
[2:04:38] not achieve oneness with his divine
[2:04:41] nature. They took the Holy Ghost and put
[2:04:44] their own nature into it. John 14:26.
[2:04:47] But the comforter which is the Holy
[2:04:49] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[2:04:53] name. What is my name?
[2:04:57] The revelation of God made flesh.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; The father will send the ability
[2:05:06] in my name.
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; He shall teach you all things and bring
[2:05:12] all things to your remembrance. What
[2:05:14] does it mean? You forgot. No. The word
[2:05:16] remembrance means consciousness.
[2:05:19] Whatsoever I said. In other words,
[2:05:21] because he wants you to take the word to
[2:05:23] the world, you are going to come into
[2:05:24] situations where you speak into a
[2:05:26] person, you've got no idea what to say.
[2:05:28] The Holy Ghost will put it into you
[2:05:31] exactly what to say. And you know what?
[2:05:34] How you taught in the denominations? You
[2:05:36] repeat the same thing to everybody.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; This doesn't work.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; With with who God has called. Because
[2:05:42] with some people, you have to sit with
[2:05:44] them for days.
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; Some people takes five minutes. How are
[2:05:48] you going to know which is which?
[2:05:52] Only the Holy Ghost knows because he has
[2:05:54] called them. See, so it's not just
[2:05:56] having an answer. It's having the right
[2:05:59] answer for the person.
[2:06:01] Remembrance means your present
[2:06:03] conscience. Do you remember there's
[2:06:05] another scripture where he says, "Go.
[2:06:07] Don't even think about what to say
[2:06:10] because when it's time to say it, I will
[2:06:12] give you the words.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Just go. Don't even think
[2:06:16] about how much money you have in your
[2:06:17] purse. Don't even think about the
[2:06:19] clothes in your bag. Don't even think
[2:06:20] about the food you have to eat. When you
[2:06:22] get there, it'll all work out.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; Zeal. He also says the Holy Ghost is
[2:06:29] sent by the father in his name. I don't
[2:06:31] want to uh labor on that. I know there
[2:06:34] will be, you know, so much more to this
[2:06:37] we we've dealt with in great detail in
[2:06:39] 2012, but to make it plain, you have to
[2:06:42] be baptized with the spirit of God mixed
[2:06:44] with zeal. And I I'm telling you, after
[2:06:46] what I'm saying today, there's going to
[2:06:48] be many of my colleagues in the in the
[2:06:50] ministry will go back and search the
[2:06:52] message and combat with this quote and
[2:06:54] this quote and and resist. But I'm
[2:06:57] pleading with you. I'm not offend I'm
[2:07:00] not offended if you disagree with me. I
[2:07:02] only have a problem with the fact that
[2:07:04] you what you are doing is causing us to
[2:07:07] be one step back with our children.
[2:07:11] I'm not trying to resist the prophet.
[2:07:14] I'm trying to elevate him.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; The truth is in this day there are
[2:07:21] people leaving the message. There are
[2:07:23] people leaving the prophet and these
[2:07:25] fellas who are sniping at us from the
[2:07:28] shadows are doing nothing and have no
[2:07:31] solutions.
[2:07:33] We are actually the ministers getting
[2:07:35] the young people attracted to the word
[2:07:37] and they're sniping at us.
[2:07:40] I don't get it.
[2:07:43] In a world where you've got believe the
[2:07:45] sign and all of these things and you've
[2:07:47] got all these people coming against
[2:07:49] taking people away and our ministry is
[2:07:52] attracting people to the message, you're
[2:07:54] sniping us.
[2:07:58] I don't know. I don't get it. You know,
[2:08:01] to go and correct ministers across your
[2:08:04] pulpit. What are you doing?
[2:08:08] What are you teaching your children?
[2:08:13] ministers need, you know, to somebody
[2:08:16] sit back and consider if what we are
[2:08:18] doing is really to contradict the
[2:08:20] prophet or whether we are actually
[2:08:21] elevating his message. What are we
[2:08:24] doing? Are we am I trying to to say the
[2:08:27] prophet was wrong? No. Actually, what
[2:08:29] I'm doing is I'm actually telling you
[2:08:31] what the prophet meant so you don't get
[2:08:33] confused by what he said.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Okay, let's get to the quote.
[2:08:40] Young people, the prophet says there's
[2:08:42] another message. So, two messages you
[2:08:44] need to read. You considering taking
[2:08:47] this step, future home and the token.
[2:08:51] There's a there's about four token
[2:08:52] messages, I think, and and and you can
[2:08:54] read every single one of them or one of
[2:08:56] them. Your choice. I would say every
[2:08:58] one, you know. Paragraph 76. Because it
[2:09:02] could not come upon a human being
[2:09:04] because the animal life doesn't have a
[2:09:05] soul. In other words, in the Old
[2:09:07] Testament, they they they sacrificed
[2:09:10] bulls and goats and the blood of the
[2:09:12] bull and the goats poured into the
[2:09:14] ground, but it's an animal life. He's
[2:09:16] saying that animal life, that animal
[2:09:18] doesn't have a soul. Its life cannot
[2:09:21] come back onto the believer because the
[2:09:24] believer cannot be made like unto the
[2:09:27] animal, right? The animal doesn't know
[2:09:30] that he is naked. He just he doesn't
[2:09:33] realize sin. It knows none. So therefore
[2:09:35] it's a living being but not a living
[2:09:37] soul. Therefore the animal life could
[2:09:39] not come back upon a human which which
[2:09:41] is telling you why animal sacrifice
[2:09:45] is ineffective.
[2:09:48] Therefore the animal life could not come
[2:09:50] upon a human life because it didn't have
[2:09:52] a soul in that life. Now there is a life
[2:09:54] a blood a life a soul in that life. The
[2:09:57] soul is the nature of that life.
[2:09:59] Therefore it had no certain nature. It
[2:10:01] was it has animal. Therefore, the blood
[2:10:03] stood for a token that the life had been
[2:10:05] given. But in this glorious place, under
[2:10:08] this covenant, there is a difference
[2:10:10] between the blood and the life. The
[2:10:13] token for the believer today is the Holy
[2:10:16] Ghost,
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; not a blood, a chemistry, but it is the
[2:10:20] Holy Spirit of God. That is the token
[2:10:23] that God requires of the church today.
[2:10:25] This is the evidence that there is an
[2:10:28] absolute difference between the Holy
[2:10:30] Ghost in the New Testament and the Holy
[2:10:32] Ghost in the Old Testament.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; Absolutely different. One was under the
[2:10:36] covenant of animal life. One is under
[2:10:38] the covenant of the life of Christ.
[2:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; While a blood cell could not break and
[2:10:43] put the life upon a believer when it
[2:10:45] can.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; The prophet tells us they were under the
[2:10:50] blood of bulls and goats. So saints,
[2:10:52] brother says the token is a uh sign. The
[2:10:56] Holy Ghost is the token. You all got
[2:10:57] that? Where's this coming from? Remember
[2:11:00] the blood that was applied in the doors
[2:11:01] and the lintils. And when I see the
[2:11:03] blood, I will pass over you.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; This is that token.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. That must be on display.
[2:11:11] What? The ability given by God and the
[2:11:14] zeal.
[2:11:16] Why are you failing?
[2:11:18] This is the whole point of telling you
[2:11:20] what purpose really is. Why are you
[2:11:23] struggling? Why are you backsliding?
[2:11:25] Because you are sitting around doing
[2:11:27] nothing for him.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; That what is the token? The seal for
[2:11:35] souls.
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; Let's not beat about the bush. How many
[2:11:40] people claim to have the anointing of
[2:11:42] the Holy Ghost and then say seals are
[2:11:44] not open
[2:11:47] or that everything is for the future?
[2:11:50] Does Pentecost have the token because
[2:11:52] they're getting the same Holy Ghost
[2:11:53] you're claiming to resurrect? Do they
[2:11:56] have the token though they speak with
[2:11:57] tongues of men and of angels? Does
[2:11:59] Pentecost have a token though they have
[2:12:01] gifts of healing and prophecy?
[2:12:04] So, is there a difference between their
[2:12:06] token and our token?
[2:12:09] Yes, there is a difference when the life
[2:12:11] of Christ comes upon you through the
[2:12:13] Holy Ghost baptism, the true Holy Ghost
[2:12:15] baptism for the purpose of purging out
[2:12:18] unbelief from your soul. Glory to God.
[2:12:21] Which brings me to the last part of this
[2:12:23] message, the three purgings.
[2:12:27] Saints in the message the future home of
[2:12:29] the heavenly bridegroom and earthly
[2:12:31] bride which I would encourage every
[2:12:32] young person saying it again to read
[2:12:35] this message and study with a pen and a
[2:12:37] notebook. Okay, got it. Brother Brandon
[2:12:40] speaks on a phenomenal thought that I
[2:12:44] have not seen him speak anywhere else.
[2:12:46] In this message, you will find many
[2:12:48] statements that will confuse you in your
[2:12:50] early stage of the message. But I want
[2:12:52] to point you to one particular thing.
[2:12:54] It's going to be from paragraph 89
[2:12:56] onwards but he speaks about it
[2:12:58] sporadically in other places right uh
[2:13:01] one particular thing is that how God
[2:13:04] redeems the earth parallels how he
[2:13:07] redeems you
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; how he redeems the earth is how he
[2:13:12] redeems your body
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; your person your being three purgings
[2:13:19] okay let's read paragraph 89 I'm going
[2:13:22] to go through it fast says let me Just
[2:13:25] take this board just a minute. So
[2:13:27] explaining quickly. Brother Brandon
[2:13:28] takes a board. He draws draws a heart
[2:13:31] here and he draws a heart there. Said
[2:13:33] here's a human heart. Here's a human
[2:13:35] heart. I'm long ways from an artist.
[2:13:37] Here's a human heart. And here is a
[2:13:38] human heart. This one over here has a
[2:13:40] snake in it. That's sin. This one here
[2:13:43] has a dove in it. That's the Holy
[2:13:44] Spirit. Here he has a life. Well, this
[2:13:46] one here, he has malice, hatred, envy.
[2:13:50] That's what's causing his fellow here.
[2:13:51] Snake. Well, this one here has love,
[2:13:54] joy, longsuffering. What does it down
[2:13:56] here? Now, when you ask or you've
[2:13:59] forgiven of your sins, you've only done
[2:14:01] this, taken that away, but the thing
[2:14:04] that made you do it is still there.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; That's the old root of evil is still.
[2:14:09] So, in other words, you've come through
[2:14:10] water baptism. You've repented. You made
[2:14:12] things right. You confessed. Your sin is
[2:14:14] taken away. The snake is still there.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; The thing that made you do it is still
[2:14:19] there,
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; right? Got it? Yeah.
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; So, the first washing takes away the
[2:14:27] sin.
[2:14:28] You still need the cause
[2:14:31] to be taken away. Secondly, next quote,
[2:14:34] paragraph 91.
[2:14:37] Secondly, comes sanctification.
[2:14:39] What is sanctification?
[2:14:42] Sanctification sets our mind in order
[2:14:45] for holiness.
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; To think right.
[2:14:51] You were waterbaptized. You heard the
[2:14:52] message. God sent a prophet. You're
[2:14:54] still not thinking right.
[2:14:58] To think right. To set your mind in
[2:15:01] order of holiness.
[2:15:03] Take it away. Sanctification is a
[2:15:05] compound Greek word would mean cleaned,
[2:15:06] set aside for service. See, I didn't
[2:15:08] make that up. That that's from the
[2:15:10] message. Everything I tell you is from
[2:15:12] the message. Sanctification,
[2:15:14] consecration, cleaned up, set apart for
[2:15:17] service. service, purpose, purpose,
[2:15:21] zeal.
[2:15:23] You being set aside for it. You still
[2:15:25] don't have the zeal yet. You just
[2:15:27] prepared. Got it? The next part of 92
[2:15:31] comes the baptism of fire and holy ghost
[2:15:34] that God may dwell in us. So the last
[2:15:38] part, so up to that point, God is still
[2:15:40] not even dwelling in you.
[2:15:44] &gt;&gt; Got it? Yeah.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Now, the Holy Ghost comes upon you and
[2:15:48] God is still not dwelling in you. God is
[2:15:51] upon you with an anointing, with a seal,
[2:15:55] with a fire. It's preparing you for God
[2:15:57] to dwell in you. Hold that thought if
[2:16:00] you still think because people go on, I
[2:16:02] got the Holy Ghost. I got God in me. No,
[2:16:05] you haven't.
[2:16:07] And the fire of God cleanses our heart
[2:16:09] and puts the Holy Ghost inside. Then we
[2:16:12] bring forth the same life that this did
[2:16:14] because that's in us. Now, how do we
[2:16:17] know that's the process? How do we know
[2:16:21] that God still has to come in and dwell
[2:16:23] in after the fire? Because of the earth.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Notice how now let's go to the next
[2:16:30] quote. Proverb 95. Secification.
[2:16:33] Third, second stage of it. Now, here's
[2:16:36] what sanctification does. It cleanses
[2:16:37] the mind, sets the heart, the mind of
[2:16:40] the heart in the order of holiness,
[2:16:43] right? In other words, when you are
[2:16:46] sanctified by the blood,
[2:16:49] the blood, right? What that does is it
[2:16:51] cleanses your mind. It makes you think
[2:16:53] different.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; A man can repent of his sins and he's
[2:16:58] still thinking of
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; you may be an immoral man, immoral
[2:17:03] looking woman. He finds he's still
[2:17:05] there. Maybe he's a drunken. Every time
[2:17:06] he smells the drink, it's still there.
[2:17:09] But when he gets sanctified, that
[2:17:11] cleanses that desire out of him. Listen,
[2:17:14] sanctification is a process still about
[2:17:17] purpose. It's pointing you towards
[2:17:18] something. It's quite simple. I
[2:17:21] explained this to you before. If you had
[2:17:23] a gift of carpentry and then you got
[2:17:26] tuted by somebody who is something in, I
[2:17:30] don't know, um, metalology. So you
[2:17:33] worked with wood but now you you've been
[2:17:35] taught by somebody who works with metal.
[2:17:38] What's happened? Your your mind has been
[2:17:40] shifted from carpentry to metal work
[2:17:44] and all you're doing is getting the
[2:17:47] knowledge of a future purpose.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; You are being sanctified.
[2:17:52] You are being set into a new vocation, a
[2:17:55] new career. Are you with me?
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; That's all is happening. Your mind is
[2:17:59] changing. Your thoughts are being
[2:18:02] focused.
[2:18:03] It's how you think. That's what the
[2:18:04] blood does for you. You're still not
[2:18:07] there yet.
[2:18:10] When he gets sanctified, that cleanses
[2:18:12] the desire out. He can still be tempted
[2:18:16] to go back to woodwork,
[2:18:19] but he takes the want of it away. Still,
[2:18:23] he is not right yet. He is baptized with
[2:18:26] the Holy Ghost and fire, cleansed, burnt
[2:18:30] out, cleaned up, then put into service
[2:18:32] of God. Sanctification only sets you
[2:18:35] aside for service. So you can come
[2:18:38] through the waters, you can come through
[2:18:39] the blood, and you still not serve him.
[2:18:44] Are you still with me? Future home
[2:18:46] paragraph 99, brothers. And notice just
[2:18:49] exactly how that came. The messages
[2:18:51] come. Martin Luther justification. John
[2:18:53] Wesley sanctification. Pentecostalism,
[2:18:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost, the messages
[2:18:57] that's where can't no be no more ages of
[2:19:00] it. We're at the end time. Three stages.
[2:19:02] Do you know brother Barry actually says
[2:19:04] there's another message. I think it
[2:19:07] could be the token one of the token
[2:19:08] messages. He says there's a there's a
[2:19:10] water age, a blood age, and a holy ghost
[2:19:12] age.
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; Water age, blood age, and a fire age or
[2:19:16] holy ghost. That's a quote. Go have a
[2:19:18] look for it. And notice now just the
[2:19:21] message Martin Luther justification and
[2:19:23] so on. The message is there. We're at
[2:19:26] the end time three stages. Baptism. He's
[2:19:29] speaking of Holy Ghost. Baptism cleanses
[2:19:31] the heart.
[2:19:33] So it's not to to do with your vocation,
[2:19:37] not to do with your thinking. This
[2:19:39] cleanses the heart. In other words, this
[2:19:41] is taking care of the snake inside
[2:19:45] the cause.
[2:19:48] Are you with me?
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Did you follow his thought?
[2:19:52] All right. Part of 100. How striking.
[2:19:55] Now he takes the place where we are to
[2:19:57] dwell in the earth through the same
[2:20:00] process.
[2:20:02] Amen.
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; You love him saints.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:08] Imagine that small little frog or bird
[2:20:10] can be so annoying.
[2:20:15] Part of 100. How striking. Now he takes
[2:20:18] the place where we are to dwell in
[2:20:20] through the same process. In other
[2:20:21] words, the the earth. He's called the
[2:20:24] church through justification, called it
[2:20:25] through sanctification, fully with the
[2:20:26] Holy Ghost and fire. Took it through a
[2:20:28] process that he himself and the Holy
[2:20:30] Spirit himself, the son of God, could
[2:20:32] dwell in the heart. Paragraph 102. Now
[2:20:34] he done the world where that bride is
[2:20:37] going to live in the same way. Paragraph
[2:20:40] 103. Next one. Notice the anti-olivian.
[2:20:44] What's that? Flood. He had it repented
[2:20:47] by through the bride of that day Noah.
[2:20:50] He gave it a water baptism. Covered it
[2:20:52] with water,
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; right? Flushed out the earth. We spoke
[2:20:56] about it on Wednesday. Brought in a new
[2:20:58] law about spilling of blood.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; I will require blood. If you spill
[2:21:05] blood, I will require. Remember that new
[2:21:07] law, new earth, adjustment of
[2:21:10] everything. But it had to be washed with
[2:21:12] water first. Then paragraph 104 Christ
[2:21:16] came and shed his blood upon it. He
[2:21:18] shows how that the blood of Christ
[2:21:20] drained out of his body and sanctified
[2:21:22] the earth with his blood. Brother
[2:21:24] Brandon knocks in the pulpit. See how
[2:21:26] Satan scripture try to make him break
[2:21:28] God's plan to receive it. Give it to him
[2:21:30] when he took up the mountain try to give
[2:21:31] it to him without the purchase of the
[2:21:33] blood. Paragraph 110.
[2:21:36] But now it has to go through a baptism
[2:21:38] of fire. Do you notice God is not
[2:21:40] dwelling in it yet?
[2:21:43] is still cleansing the earth. Baptism of
[2:21:46] fire, holy fire from God cleanses the
[2:21:48] earth and the heavens around it. Then
[2:21:51] it's purchased that redeemed can live on
[2:21:53] it living in peace. I'm going to go
[2:21:55] through the highlight for God in the new
[2:21:57] world that is to come to dwell in the
[2:22:00] earth. Cuz you said God he dwells in the
[2:22:02] human heart. He and the bride becomes
[2:22:04] one and they go to their home in the new
[2:22:06] world. So water in Noah's time, blood in
[2:22:10] Christ time, fire after the the the
[2:22:13] battle of Gog and Magog purges the whole
[2:22:15] earth, then the new heaven and new
[2:22:17] earth, and the holy city, the new
[2:22:19] Jerusalem. God comes and dwell. Behold,
[2:22:21] these are my people. I shall be their
[2:22:23] God. The tabernacle of God is with man.
[2:22:25] After three purgings,
[2:22:29] &gt;&gt; you have to be cleansed. Body, spirit,
[2:22:33] soul.
[2:22:35] Three purgings and it takes two
[2:22:38] baptisms. Water baptism,
[2:22:41] Holy Ghost and fire. Two baptisms, three
[2:22:45] purging.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; You have to be immersed in separation
[2:22:52] and you have to be immersed in ability
[2:22:55] and zeal.
[2:22:57] The blood is not asking you to be
[2:22:59] immersed in it.
[2:23:01] It's asking for the life to come in. The
[2:23:04] life of the blood cell is going to come
[2:23:06] in and purge your mind. Amen. Future
[2:23:09] home of paragraph. Did we read 111?
[2:23:13] Let's go to 111.
[2:23:15] See the heart has to be cleansed like
[2:23:17] that. I'm closing. Before God can come
[2:23:19] down in the person of the Holy Ghost,
[2:23:21] which is Christ come down, dwell in the
[2:23:23] human heart, it must be repented. It
[2:23:25] must be baptized in his name. We read
[2:23:27] this in the beginning to show who it
[2:23:29] belongs to. Then it must be cleansed by
[2:23:31] the blood of Jesus. Then the holy fire
[2:23:34] and holy ghost from God comes down and
[2:23:36] burns out all desire of sin, all the
[2:23:38] nature of the world. Do you see that?
[2:23:40] You'll be water baptized. You'll still
[2:23:42] make mistakes. You'll you'll be uh uh
[2:23:46] centered in your mind, directed in your
[2:23:48] mind by the blood in the life of Christ
[2:23:50] being preached to you all through the
[2:23:51] word. Every step is by the word. But
[2:23:54] then when it comes to Holy Ghost and
[2:23:56] zeal and fire, that's the part that's
[2:23:59] going to uproot the evil that caused it
[2:24:02] in the first place.
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; So he speaks of these three purgings,
[2:24:08] water, blood, spirit, and fire. Saints,
[2:24:12] once again, the purging of blood comes
[2:24:14] by revelation of the word. The purging
[2:24:16] of water comes by revelation of the
[2:24:17] word. The purging of the Holy Ghost
[2:24:19] comes by the word. In every stage, it is
[2:24:22] washing by the word.
[2:24:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's got to be a word in the
[2:24:27] beginning that draws you to the prophet,
[2:24:29] to the message. That word will wash you.
[2:24:31] There's a word that has to do with
[2:24:32] sanctification while you are in the
[2:24:35] message that will wash you, that will
[2:24:36] cleanse you, that will purge you.
[2:24:38] There's going to be a word under that
[2:24:40] that gives you ability for the open book
[2:24:42] that will purge you and will wash you
[2:24:44] and set you into purpose.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; Praise be to his name. The last purging
[2:24:50] of the spirit and fire is his face
[2:24:53] covering um covering out the soul that
[2:24:56] removes all ability. The phase that is
[2:25:00] to do with covering uh um uh scouring
[2:25:04] out the soul that removes all ability to
[2:25:06] disbelieve the word. Removing every
[2:25:10] ounce of ability to disbelieve.
[2:25:13] When you reach that place,
[2:25:16] you know, um, young people, I'll tell
[2:25:19] you something.
[2:25:22] You'll sit around on your phones, you
[2:25:24] sit around on internet and whatever.
[2:25:26] You're actually preventing yourself from
[2:25:30] becoming something.
[2:25:33] Um, let let me just give you a little
[2:25:36] bit a little example.
[2:25:39] Let's say, and I'm not saying you must
[2:25:40] do this. I'm just saying if you just
[2:25:43] start here we go back to the car. If you
[2:25:46] just thought let me start a car wash in
[2:25:48] my neighborhood.
[2:25:50] When you washed your first 10 cars and
[2:25:53] earned that money and that money is
[2:25:55] yours is taxfree belongs to nobody else
[2:25:59] not even your parents.
[2:26:02] You are going to wash a thousand cars.
[2:26:07] That's my point.
[2:26:09] Once you've done it once, you're not
[2:26:12] going to stop.
[2:26:14] All you have to do is get up out of your
[2:26:17] couch.
[2:26:20] &gt;&gt; One time. One time.
[2:26:23] Earn some money and then you're bugged.
[2:26:27] You got the bug of earning money.
[2:26:30] Then you earn enough money and you sell
[2:26:32] your first car. Then you're going to be
[2:26:34] a car salesman.
[2:26:38] You're not washing cars anymore, but it
[2:26:40] started with washing cars.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; Then you sell your first car. Then you
[2:26:44] sell a 100 cars. Now you own a
[2:26:47] dealership.
[2:26:48] [Music]
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Did you ever think when you started
[2:26:51] washing cars that you'll be a dealership
[2:26:53] owner one day?
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; That's how it starts. But you that's
[2:26:57] sitting around on cell phones waiting
[2:26:59] for an epiphany or some great idea
[2:27:03] while all the entrepreneurs and
[2:27:05] millionaires in this world started
[2:27:06] washing cars
[2:27:08] selling stuff.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; That's where it started. You know how it
[2:27:12] started? By giving up idleness.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; That's the trap today. So one of none of
[2:27:21] these purgings need uh to come with
[2:27:25] abundance of shouting and screaming.
[2:27:27] Nothing not one of them needs to come
[2:27:29] with that. Right? You can it might
[2:27:32] happen to you. There's no common recipe
[2:27:34] for everyone. But what is certain is you
[2:27:37] need to be purged in every way body
[2:27:41] spirit and soul. If you apply the
[2:27:43] thought going through these two baptisms
[2:27:46] and three purgings, it is the
[2:27:48] restoration of all things unto God. It
[2:27:52] makes you the person, you your person,
[2:27:55] the future home
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; of the heavenly bridegroom, the word and
[2:28:00] the person.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; That's the whole point of it. It's going
[2:28:03] to make you the future home
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; of the marriage of the lamb and his
[2:28:09] bride.
[2:28:10] I'm saying that in your baptisms, you
[2:28:13] will be purged by the washing of water
[2:28:14] by the word. You'll be justified by the
[2:28:17] waters of your water baptism,
[2:28:18] separation, sanctified by the life cell
[2:28:21] in the blood of Christ, uh sealed by the
[2:28:24] Holy Spirit of God's ability and zeal to
[2:28:28] save the souls of others. The true
[2:28:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost will give you
[2:28:31] a heart for people and make you desire
[2:28:34] to speak the word and share your love of
[2:28:37] God. You don't even have to teach the
[2:28:41] seals to someone.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; Share your love of God with someone.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; Lift up someone's spirit from where they
[2:28:48] are downfallen
[2:28:51] and and crestf fallen. Just lift them up
[2:28:53] with your love of him.
[2:28:56] Amen.
[2:28:56] &gt;&gt; And they'll come to you. You know what's
[2:28:59] a problem I find with message churches
[2:29:01] today? This is a disgrace. And I'm going
[2:29:04] to say it. You don't even have enough
[2:29:06] oil for the foolish virgin to come and
[2:29:08] ask you.
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[2:29:17] Maybe you got oil. I don't know what
[2:29:19] it's in your basement or something. But
[2:29:22] the foolish virgin is not even coming to
[2:29:24] ask you.
[2:29:26] In fact, you're looking at them and
[2:29:27] thinking they got more oil.
[2:29:30] And that's why you're trying to
[2:29:32] resurrect what they had.
[2:29:34] You're not even living in that vision.
[2:29:40] The true baptism of the Holy Ghost will
[2:29:42] give you a heart for people. You will
[2:29:43] not be afraid to be scorned or rejected.
[2:29:46] You will not be afraid to tell the truth
[2:29:47] because you are set free. You will not
[2:29:50] care to work things out because you know
[2:29:52] he will put the word in your mouth in
[2:29:54] due season when it is necessary. It will
[2:29:56] make you see all people as equals and
[2:29:59] treat them as Christ's sheep and give
[2:30:01] you the heart to strengthen your
[2:30:03] brethren.
[2:30:06] I got nothing more to say. I'm going to
[2:30:07] read two quotes and we done. Paragraph
[2:30:10] 79. What if baptism inducts you into
[2:30:13] fellowship? The Holy Spirit baptism
[2:30:17] inducts you into Christ.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; There is the truth. Marriage of the
[2:30:22] lamb. This is just to inspire you.
[2:30:23] inspire you and tell you,
[2:30:27] I hope you've had enough of yourself and
[2:30:29] let's become better people.
[2:30:32] A lot of us get ourselves puffed up when
[2:30:36] uh when we get a Pentecostal brother uh
[2:30:39] see somebody down in a little u mission
[2:30:42] or a little bitty church and they go to
[2:30:44] a big church, we belong to the first
[2:30:46] church or the big church or something
[2:30:47] like that and look down upon them. What
[2:30:50] you need is the Holy Ghost to deflate
[2:30:53] you a little bit.
[2:30:55] Let you know that a real true baptism of
[2:30:57] the Holy Ghost will make a tuxedo suit,
[2:31:00] put his arms around a pair of overalls
[2:31:03] and say, "Brother,
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; that's real oldtime salvation. The
[2:31:08] powerful almighty God, yes sir, will
[2:31:10] make an old silk dress, put its arms
[2:31:12] around a calico and say, "Sister, I love
[2:31:15] you." It sure will. There's what's
[2:31:17] lacking. sniping at each other
[2:31:21] from the shadows
[2:31:24] like a long gun shooter.
[2:31:26] No guts to come up to a brother and tell
[2:31:28] him, "I disagree with you. Let's talk
[2:31:31] this out. Let's fellowship. Let's see
[2:31:34] where we disagree. Let's love one
[2:31:36] another still." Where is that?
[2:31:40] Where is that? That I can reach out to
[2:31:42] someone who is who is less than me, who
[2:31:45] is different to me, and say, "I love
[2:31:46] you. We're one. I'm not above you. I'm
[2:31:50] not elite.
[2:31:53] I tell you, not enough oil for a foolish
[2:31:57] virgin to come knocking at your door.
[2:32:01] This is what's happening today. Saints,
[2:32:03] young people, I know it's a lot, but
[2:32:07] trust me, it's not even a scratch.
[2:32:10] There's so much in there. Go and read
[2:32:12] the messages I've recommended to you.
[2:32:15] Take those scriptures when when you read
[2:32:18] the Bible, read a scripture and dream
[2:32:22] about it. Sit back in a chair. Put your
[2:32:24] phone off. Sit back in a chair and
[2:32:27] think, "Lord, what was it like in John
[2:32:29] the Baptist day
[2:32:32] and let dream I'm standing on the banks
[2:32:35] of the river Jordan and he's baptizing
[2:32:37] people. Describe what he looks like.
[2:32:40] Describe what the water's like. Describe
[2:32:42] the faces of the people. Describe the
[2:32:44] Pharisees. Think about what he was
[2:32:46] preaching before he got in the water.
[2:32:50] Describe where he lived. Describe the
[2:32:52] house where he came from. Describe those
[2:32:54] who were baptized. Go think about what
[2:32:57] they had to do to come to that water.
[2:32:59] Think about how they had to walk down
[2:33:01] that bank with the scribes and Pharisees
[2:33:03] and Sadducees standing there looking at
[2:33:05] them, knowing that they're waiting for
[2:33:08] them to come out of the water to to get
[2:33:11] at them, to persecute them.
[2:33:15] And then you'll find something come upon
[2:33:18] you to realize what you have to go
[2:33:21] through.
[2:33:23] Now it's not just one verse. Now it's
[2:33:26] volumes.
[2:33:28] Do that for all the scriptures in the
[2:33:30] Bible.
[2:33:32] If ever you had something to dream, you
[2:33:34] know, I got down on my pillow last
[2:33:36] night. I I got to bed like about 1:30 or
[2:33:39] something and I just could still
[2:33:41] couldn't sleep. I was just my mind was
[2:33:44] still in this and I'm still dreaming
[2:33:47] about it and then eventually it put me
[2:33:50] to sleep because it was so peaceful and
[2:33:53] amazing. Put me to sleep cuz I I it
[2:33:57] could get everything else out of my
[2:33:59] head. But um I I was so enjoying
[2:34:03] thinking about what God has done for us
[2:34:05] through all the generations. It's so
[2:34:08] peaceful.
[2:34:10] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads
[2:34:12] together.
