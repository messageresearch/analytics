[0:00] How was your sunship given to you? By
[0:03] predestination.
[0:05] How is it? How was our inheritance given
[0:08] to us? Through what? Predestination.
[0:10] Predestination is fornowledge. That how
[0:13] did God know he could trust you to be a
[0:16] preacher? His fornowledge. Not he that
[0:19] willth or runth. It's God that showeth
[0:21] mercy. That's right. Predestination. He
[0:23] knew what was in you. He knew what was
[0:25] in you before you come to the earth.
[0:27] There's our story of God and man. He
[0:29] know what was in you before there was
[0:31] ever a earth for you to come on.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; That's him. That's the infinite God. The
[0:38] infinite. We're finite. We can only
[0:41] think finite saints. Predestination
[0:45] by fornowledge. We're closing. Sunship
[0:48] was given to us to the elect by
[0:51] predestination. That was his plan for
[0:53] you. That that had to be revealed to
[0:55] you. You have no way of working that out
[0:57] yourself. Do you agree? Right? God could
[1:00] see by fornowledge what character you
[1:02] were supposed to have. You would never
[1:03] have known. You don't even know what
[1:06] what to do tomorrow.
[1:08] So he he predestinated you for a purpose
[1:11] and led you while you were not aware
[1:15] that he was leading you to an earth an
[1:17] earthly uh inheritance that could lead
[1:20] us to that sunship and make sure that we
[1:22] actually get it. Are you with us? By
[1:26] forn knowledge, he could make the
[1:29] prophet a preacher
[1:32] or you a teacher or a mechanic or uh
[1:37] like a uh a carpenter or something or
[1:40] the other. He could make you into
[1:42] something, right? They were all uh by
[1:46] fornowledge he could make you into
[1:48] something. He could put into you an
[1:49] attribute that could lead you to become
[1:51] something you would never have thought
[1:54] could even lead you to a place where
[1:56] there is an earthly vocation for you
[1:58] like an like an earthly
[2:01] uh career or an earthly uh position in
[2:04] life that would be suitable to the
[2:08] purpose of a son of God.
[2:11] [clears throat]
[2:13] Is that right? You know because of that
[2:15] attribute within you, you're not going
[2:17] to choose something to be in this life
[2:19] that will contradict sunship.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; This is why there's such a a pressure on
[2:28] us as as people to not become something
[2:32] that will contradict God's word. Amen.
[2:36] And Abraham was looking for a city whose
[2:38] builder and maker was God according to
[2:40] Hebrews 11. Is that right? And they were
[2:43] all looking for something earthy because
[2:46] there was some earthly reward. And yet
[2:50] they all realized though they had
[2:52] attained Abraham received Isaac but was
[2:55] not satisfied.
[2:56] He received that promise but he realized
[2:58] there was something heavenly.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:00] &gt;&gt; David uh received the throne and then
[3:03] said but I want to build you a house.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; There's something more. Solomon did it
[3:10] and then there's something more and
[3:13] every time they had achieved their
[3:15] purpose on earth they degenerated into
[3:18] something and lost their testimonies
[3:21] became something else and got into
[3:23] idolatry and there was something more
[3:26] they were looking to and did not attain.
[3:29] Our inheritance in heaven is our
[3:31] theophanes and that gives us our
[3:33] sunship. Amen.
[3:35] &gt;&gt; Sunship is our heavenly relationship to
[3:37] God and the father is
[3:41] ah as his sons that entitles us to our
[3:45] earthly inheritance.
[3:47] Amen. So putting it plainly, your
[3:50] earthly inheritance one day is a
[3:52] glorified body,
[3:54] &gt;&gt; a body that will live on earth for
[3:56] eternity.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; But you cannot get that without becoming
[4:02] sun first.
[4:04] You cannot get that without receiving
[4:07] adoption because you can only take over
[4:10] the earthly inheritance if you have the
[4:12] title deed.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; To get the title deed, you have to
[4:15] become a son. To become a son, you need
[4:19] the spirit of adoption. You need spoken
[4:22] word. You need to overcome this by
[4:25] spoken word. Then you receive adoption.
[4:28] That's receiving full sunship. That's
[4:31] receiving earthly inheritance. That's
[4:33] the road to adoption.
[4:36] &gt;&gt; That's what that's why we are here. Look
[4:38] at where we are in that plan. Christ
[4:41] came 2,000 years ago. The baptism of the
[4:44] Holy Ghost came 2,000 years ago. Where
[4:46] are we right now?
[4:49] We are so FAR AHEAD, SO FAR ALONG. We
[4:51] are right here at the end where adoption
[4:55] is at the brink.
[4:58] &gt;&gt; We are at the time where the rapture is
[5:00] promised. We are at the time where
[5:02] theophanes have to be revealed to each
[5:04] son of God. Where all THOSE THAT WERE
[5:06] DEAD SHALL BE CHANGED AND THOSE that are
[5:08] living shall be changed. For what
[5:09] purpose? Once we have all fully received
[5:12] sunship, it is time to take the earthly
[5:15] inheritance.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:17] &gt;&gt; And then what happens when we receive
[5:20] sunship while we're at the marriage
[5:22] supper? Our earthly inheritance is taken
[5:25] away from the enemy who has been
[5:27] squatting on it for a long time.
[5:30] and it is purged for our purpose.
[5:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in closing, rejoice and be
[5:40] exceeding glad.
[5:43] That is rapture. For what reason? For
[5:46] great is your reward in heaven. For so
[5:50] persecuted they the prophets which were
[5:52] before you. Great is your reward in
[5:55] heaven. This is more than just a
[5:56] fantasy. It's more than just a story of
[5:59] one day I'll make it to heaven because I
[6:01] accepted Christ. Your reward in heaven,
[6:04] your adoption, your sunship, who you
[6:08] are, your name revealed, the right to
[6:11] life, the right to the earth.
[6:15] Great is your reward in heaven. Rejoice
[6:17] and be exceeding glad. This is the time
[6:19] for rapture. Amen.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads
[6:23] together.
