TRANSCRIPT
========================================
So let's look at sunship adoption part four paragraph 75 look has predestinated un us unto this inheritance. If I'm a right inheritance of something if God is knocking at my heart and saying William Brandom I called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel. I have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life. Now God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me. Right? God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me. Amen. Because there was nothing I could do to inherit it. I was an orphan. It was blank. It was in it was valid. There's nothing I can do. But in the fullness of time, God sent in his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world. His blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance. Now here it is to be what? What inheritance? To sunship &gt;&gt; to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Now what was becoming sons about? Remember last week becoming sons was about receiving theophony. Theophony is theophony is the heavenly inheritance. Theophony is actually the son of god. Right now you see theophony does not need adoption. &gt;&gt; Because theophony knows its father. &gt;&gt; What needs adoption is this body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because this body does not have a link to its father. &gt;&gt; The only link there is is the attribute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this body needs the spirit of adoption to come to the same understanding as the theophony. &gt;&gt; The theophony is the son of God. &gt;&gt; This is the son of man, &gt;&gt; right? The son of Charles and Elabbrand, the son of uh Steven and Jennifer Francis, the son of the Frances. This is this body. But then someday you come to an understanding. I am not the son of so and so. I am the son of God. How do you come to that understanding? You're coming to the same understanding of that theophony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that theophony is the son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what becoming sons means. So your inheritance, this body's inheritance, this what this body is looking to is to become a son. Amen. Becoming sons is about theophanes. So this one word speaks of everything we have been speaking about, right? But the first part of our inheritance is sunship. That's the first part of our inheritance. So now here's the thing. Adam inherited the earth, right? &gt;&gt; What made Adam God of the earth, the theophony? &gt;&gt; So you cannot even inherit the earth first without getting the theophony. &gt;&gt; So without getting the heavenly inheritance, you cannot inherit the earthly inheritance. Let me put it to you personally. You cannot have the eternal fleshly body for each one of you personally unless you first inherit the theophony. &gt;&gt; Because it's the theophony that's going to make the flesh eternal. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Understood? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what you are looking for permanently. &gt;&gt; That's what Abraham was searching for. a city who which had foundations whose builder and maker was God. Because if he obtained theophony, he would live forever in the flesh. &gt;&gt; Though he had obtained Israel, he was still looking for a city whose builder and maker was God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So this is becoming sons connects you with your theophony, your heavenly inheritance which then gives you the earth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's the title deed. Do you see it? So this is not about seeing Jesus as God. The first thing we inherit is sunship of Christ. We see the sunship of Christ through belief in the revelation of Christ as God. And that's not saying ah okay so Jesus is God prove it to me and then we go through this whole you know godship uh doctrine and prove this by that scripture and that to me that's exhausting to have to to have to go through some to prove to you by scriptures and what this one says and how this one is better than that one and how brother Brandham says this better than Billy Graham or how brotherham says this better than I got no time for that. What? Like what's preventing you from seeing that Christ is is God? What do you need? Christ himself said, "I've been here so long. You You do not know that I am the father. The father I am in the Father, the Father in me, and we are one. Have I been with you so long and you're still asking to see the Father?" &gt;&gt; What do you need to know? What do you need to satisfy that immature little puny childish brain of yours that requires logic and reasoning and proof and and all the links and sources you can get from the internet to prove that Christ is God? &gt;&gt; This is not about seeing Jesus as God. This this is the belief that we have by faith. &gt;&gt; The mystery revealed in Christ. Okay. Are you are you with me? I'm going to say this once. If you're not going to get it now, you're never going to get it ever. Pack up and leave. Right? What is the mystery of Christ? What is Jesus Christ? What does he mean by if you've seen me, you've seen the father? What does it mean to you personally? Only one thing. Jesus Christ is proof that man can be God. &gt;&gt; That's the most meaningful thing to you. &gt;&gt; Everything else is Christian theology. &gt;&gt; What manner of man is this that the wind and the seas obey him? &gt;&gt; What manner of man is this that he raised Lazarus from the dead? What manner of man is this that he could allow himself to be taken and scourged and put on the cross to die and then rise again? What manner of man is this to forgive sins? What manner of man is this to descend to hell and release one dimension and take them up into another? &gt;&gt; This is the revelation that man can be God. &gt;&gt; What is this all about? The story of God and man. &gt;&gt; That God could become man and man could become God. Jesus Christ is the manifestation that man can be God. &gt;&gt; That's the only meaningful thing to you. Nothing else. &gt;&gt; That's not going to be proven to you by words of William Brandham or words of Billy Graham or whichever other ham you can find. Right? There's not not any other person. If you didn't get this by the Bible and the message already, you've missed the point. Yes. &gt;&gt; Because that's what you're being connected to. &gt;&gt; You're being connected to knowing that one day you can be like Christ. &gt;&gt; And what are you saying then? See that man can be God. &gt;&gt; That's what almost all Christians miss. That's what the Jews accused Christ of. What do they say? You being a man, &gt;&gt; make yourself God. &gt;&gt; That's the reason they crucified him. &gt;&gt; Called him bilab said he was blaspheing. That was the entire purpose and the revelation of God in Christ is that man can be God. Man can declare the father. Man can manifest the fountain of life. Man can display the fountain of seven colors. Man can display the everlasting elam. Man can display Elohim. Man can display Yahweh, Jehovah, the self-existing one. &gt;&gt; This is proof. Christ is proof that this is possible. &gt;&gt; And he came to tell you that you were that originally and sin came in by your own choice. But there's a way for you to get back there. That's Christianity. &gt;&gt; Not this nonsense we make today with churches and denominations and this name and that name and everyone's leading you someplace to to to where some man gave you an idea of what you are what you're going to be or what you have to do. And usually it amounts to paying an x amount of money to the church for the rest of your life with a promise of something cuz if you don't it's going to, you know, it's going to be detrimental to your place in heaven. That's what all men do. We know that story. It's it's recorded through history. Men are going to dupe you. Men are going to take away your free will. &gt;&gt; They're going to use religion and power and and uh and and fear and scare you about hell and demons and witchcraft and and and all kinds of terrifying things and why you need God and you need prayer and you need oil and you need holy water and you need saints and you need Mary and you need whole of people to go through or else you're dead meat. Yeah. What kind of God is that? One who walks around in eggshells and fear half his life. Crossing yourself, sprinkling, using liquids, all kinds of weird things, and blessed this and blessed cloth and blessed clothing and blessed stuff and blessed stick and blessed Bible and all of that. You're just a person still under the spirit of bondage. You haven't even seen father yet. &gt;&gt; Because let me tell you, if you seen father, you break out of your house with your chest standing out. &gt;&gt; You you you we break out of this life saying what can separate me from the love of God? &gt;&gt; No danger, peril, sore, no nothing, no disease, no death, no nothing can separate me. That's your experience when you are connected to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I want to show you. So, so what's our inheritance? Sunship, theophony, heavenly inheritance. Abraham was not linked to it yet because Messiah had not come. They all did such great things but they they did not receive it because Messiah had not yet come because father had not been revealed to them yet. &gt;&gt; Right? Now sunship has been made known. Theophony is in sight. Right now all those from Abraham's day all the way up to Christ, they died and went into the fifth dimension, Abraham's bosom. They were not yet sixth dimension. They did not attain heavenly status. Only after Christ was the way paved to sunship to attain theophony. Now what is a son? How many of you think you know what a son is? &gt;&gt; H a son is not somebody who just plays before the father. A son is not somebody who uh has to be given something and the father must pet him on the head and tell him good boy, good boy, well done. That's a dog. &gt;&gt; That's not a son.
