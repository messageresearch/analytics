[0:03] Amen. Before you take your seats, we'd
[0:05] like to read in the word of God. And we
[0:08] would like to read from
[0:10] Romans chapter 7,
[0:13] excuse me, Romans 7:14 to18.
[0:18] And the word of God reads like this. For
[0:21] we know that the law is spiritual,
[0:26] but I am carnal, sold under sin. For
[0:30] that which I do, I allow not. For what I
[0:34] would, that do I not. But what I hate,
[0:40] that do I.
[0:42] If then I do that which I would not, I
[0:46] consent unto the Lord that it is good,
[0:50] now then it is no more I that do it, but
[0:53] sin that dwelleth in me. For I know that
[0:57] in me that is in my flesh, dwelleth no
[1:00] good thing. For to will is present with
[1:04] me, but how to perform that which is
[1:06] good I find not. Amen. The Lord add a
[1:10] blessing to his word. You may be seated.
[1:14] Now this morning I um I want to do
[1:17] probably I'm thinking it is the last
[1:19] part of knowing God and knowing the
[1:21] devil. So that is um our subject knowing
[1:25] God and knowing the devil and um also
[1:29] part of the subject is the two spirits
[1:31] at war. But our title is going to be the
[1:34] white dog and the black dog.
[1:38] So just to switch back to this beautiful
[1:41] scripture, you know, when you read the
[1:44] scripture and you read it properly
[1:48] and when I say properly, I mean you
[1:51] don't just read it, you read it with the
[1:53] punctuation. You stop when you should
[1:55] stop. You pause when you should pause.
[1:58] You emphasize certain words the way you
[2:00] should. Like you can read and say uh you
[2:03] know verse 16 uh I I if then I do that
[2:07] which I would not I consent unto the
[2:09] Lord that it is good. You don't even
[2:11] catch the meaning unless you emphasize
[2:15] the right thing and pause at the right
[2:16] time. So
[2:19] for we know that the law is spiritual.
[2:25] The law is spiritual. That means it is
[2:27] only conceived in the spirit. It is only
[2:30] understood in the spirit. It is not
[2:31] something tangible. It is not something
[2:34] you can see, touch, feel, taste,
[2:36] whatever. It is something spiritual.
[2:38] It's something relating to the spirit.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; But I am carnal.
[2:44] That means I am flesh.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; In other words, that's that one phrase
[2:48] or that that sentence is basically
[2:50] saying if something that is true, the
[2:54] law is spiritual, how do I translate
[2:56] that to something that is carnal?
[2:59] Right? Sold under sin. In other words, I
[3:02] come into this world speaking lies. I
[3:04] come into this world on the back foot,
[3:08] disadvantaged.
[3:10] Now, right. And then he says, for that
[3:12] which I do, I allow not. He's actually
[3:14] saying there, the things that I do that
[3:17] are carnal, that are distasteful, I
[3:20] actually find in myself. I don't like
[3:23] it. I don't like doing wrong things.
[3:26] Right? And he says, "For what I would,
[3:29] the things that I intend to do, the
[3:31] things that I want to do, the things
[3:32] that I feel are morally good and are
[3:35] righteous, I find myself not doing
[3:37] that."
[3:39] See, but what I hate that I do. So even
[3:43] in my spirit, I recognize the
[3:45] wrongdoings and I hate those things. I I
[3:48] feel inside of me. I I I despise myself
[3:52] when I do that. I I feel like inside me
[3:54] I know that thing is wrong and I don't
[3:56] want to do it but then I do it.
[4:00] I think every human can relate to this
[4:03] scripture 100%.
[4:05] every human on earth,
[4:07] &gt;&gt; right? Maybe not Hitler, I don't know.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; But if then I do that, now this I love
[4:14] this. If then I do that which I would
[4:17] not, this is very, I don't know, you
[4:19] could say philosophical, but it's so
[4:21] full of revelation.
[4:23] If then I do which I would not, I
[4:27] consent unto the law that it is good. In
[4:30] other words, by you doing something
[4:33] wrong that you know is wrong or you know
[4:37] something is good and you don't do that
[4:39] which is good, you are actually proving
[4:41] the law.
[4:44] I consent unto the law that it is good.
[4:46] That's what it's what you're saying is
[4:49] the law is right. Like in transgressing
[4:52] standards of the message, what you are
[4:54] actually proving is that what brother
[4:56] Bam said was the truth.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. by not doing it by by the fact that
[5:02] you're doing something and hating
[5:03] yourself for doing it. You're actually
[5:05] proving cood right
[5:07] &gt;&gt; that's what it's saying
[5:10] &gt;&gt; now then it is no more but then Paul is
[5:13] saying now I understand something I'm
[5:14] coming to understand something because
[5:16] inside me if the inner man hates it
[5:20] doesn't want to do it has intentions not
[5:22] to do it and then I go ahead and do it
[5:25] then I know that it is not really me but
[5:28] something else abiding in my flesh that
[5:30] makes me do it
[5:33] &gt;&gt; see Then it is no more I that do it but
[5:36] sin that dwelleth in me. That these are
[5:40] something you really have to wrestle
[5:42] with yourself about. Verse uh 18. For I
[5:46] know that in me that is in my flesh
[5:49] dwelleth no good thing. That means I
[5:51] know that in my flesh I come born
[5:53] conceit of sexual desire born the
[5:55] natural way. I come with traits and
[5:57] genetic things from my parents from my
[5:59] lineage. I am I am programmed as I come
[6:03] into this world to uh lean to certain
[6:07] things to have certain uh tendencies. I
[6:11] come pre-programmed with that from my uh
[6:14] genetics, right? And he says um that is
[6:18] in my flesh. It there's dwelleth no good
[6:20] thing. In other words, I come into this
[6:22] world. I'm a little baby. I look at
[6:24] something someone else has. I want it. I
[6:27] lust after it. I desire it. I want it to
[6:30] be mine, not theirs. I I imagine a
[6:34] little innocent baby just reaches two
[6:36] years old and he's always s he's already
[6:38] savage,
[6:40] right? He's like he's like an univilized
[6:43] being. You you've got to teach him how
[6:45] to to have good manners, how to sit when
[6:48] he's told when you tell him to sit, how
[6:49] to behave. HE'S LIKE A SAVAGE,
[6:53] RIGHT? He he'll run around naked and
[6:55] enjoy it. He'll steal something from
[6:58] someone and enjoy it and and and stand
[7:00] there with glee looking at them. H I got
[7:03] it from you. It's mine. It's like if you
[7:06] look at it and think this guy's really
[7:08] evil,
[7:10] you know, and then you've got to take
[7:11] years to train this thing out of him to
[7:14] make him not scratch and punch and bite
[7:17] and kick and all of that. He like it
[7:19] comes pre-programmed to do that. Paul,
[7:22] that's what Paul is saying. in my flesh
[7:24] dwelleth no good thing
[7:27] and you've got to start training him to
[7:28] do that for to will is present that
[7:31] means and as I grow and I exercise my
[7:33] free will and I'm thinking about it and
[7:35] I think uh I have the ability I really
[7:38] want to do good I want to please
[7:40] somebody I want to please my family I
[7:42] want to please the church people I want
[7:43] to please God I want to do that I feel
[7:46] the will is present to do it but how to
[7:49] perform that which is good I don't know
[7:52] how to do that which is good. I feel
[7:55] like I've got all these dreams and these
[7:57] ideas of how to do so many good things
[7:59] for God. I just don't get down to doing
[8:01] it. I find myself doing all the things I
[8:04] don't want to do. Do we find ourselves
[8:06] there? That is the condition of
[8:09] humanity.
[8:10] And that's what happens when you present
[8:12] the word of God, the truth. So that's
[8:15] where we find ourselves in this subject.
[8:18] And that's where we're going to bring
[8:20] this to something the prophet spoke of
[8:22] and call it the white dog and the black
[8:25] dog. Now, when we were last uh here and
[8:28] we last spoke on this, we showed you
[8:31] that the only closest expression of God
[8:35] you will ever find or experience in your
[8:38] life today is the spirit of truth.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; God no longer appears in manifestations.
[8:46] God no longer appears in the pillar of
[8:48] fire, in the pillar of cloud, or the
[8:50] angel of the Lord being visible to any
[8:52] any one of you seen him lately.
[8:55] Angel of the Lord standing in your room
[8:57] 6t tall and so on. Nobody sees that
[9:00] anymore. No pillars of fire anymore. No
[9:02] pillars of cloud, no manifestations. You
[9:04] say, "Yeah, but I saw the gifts." What
[9:06] gifts? Speaking in tongues, prophecies,
[9:09] that's still not an appearing of the
[9:11] Lord. or it is, but it's not a physical
[9:14] uh um uh like appearing of the Lord
[9:17] where you're seeing a person. It's a
[9:19] spiritual thing, right? And God no
[9:22] longer appears in those ways. And the
[9:25] days of, you know, major prophets are
[9:27] over. There's no more major prophets to
[9:30] the Gentiles,
[9:32] right?
[9:33] So all the people who come to you and
[9:35] try to tell you and you know it's it's
[9:38] uh you know it's desperate because among
[9:40] the denominations they literally have
[9:42] prophetic classes and things. They
[9:44] really feel like the there's a need for
[9:47] prophets.
[9:52] So also are you still with me? Amen.
[9:56] &gt;&gt; In the same way,
[9:59] the devil, I hope you haven't seen him
[10:03] &gt;&gt; in a physical form. That is, does not
[10:06] appear in any physical form.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; He cannot create a form for him to
[10:11] appear in. Neither can he take on any
[10:13] physical form that was created by God.
[10:17] He does not take on forms in your dreams
[10:20] or in your visions either. those things
[10:23] those like if you you'll say hey hey hey
[10:25] hold on brother Alice I had dreams about
[10:27] the devil firstly I feel very sorry for
[10:29] you you need some good in your life stop
[10:32] dreaming about the devil but if you saw
[10:35] the devil come to you in your dreams it
[10:38] is your imagination
[10:40] making that happen it is things all your
[10:44] nightmares whatever it is these it's not
[10:46] like you're sleeping in your bed and the
[10:48] spirit of God is there and the spirit of
[10:49] the devil is there and they're waiting
[10:50] for some moment to just jump in and get
[10:53] into your brain and show you something
[10:55] scary and you wake up.
[10:59] No, that's your anxiety.
[11:02] That's depression. That's bad things
[11:05] happening to you. That's tension that's
[11:07] happening in your life or some
[11:09] unresolved issues you have with your
[11:12] wife, husband, children, family,
[11:15] whatever. And it's it's messing with
[11:16] your head. that causes
[11:19] stuff that your imagination and you'll
[11:22] see it. Like if you're scared of spiders
[11:24] and you had anxiety about a
[11:26] relationship, you'll have a nightmare
[11:28] about spiders
[11:31] and then you'll ask if that's a sign.
[11:35] It that's how it is. If you're scared of
[11:37] snakes and you had an argument with your
[11:39] wife and you and it's bothering you that
[11:42] night, you'll dream about snakes. And it
[11:44] doesn't mean your wife is a snake,
[11:45] brother.
[11:47] just simply means you're scared of
[11:49] snakes.
[11:51] I cannot tell you how many times in my
[11:54] life in the message I've heard people
[11:57] everything is a sign you know and
[12:00] especially snakes and eagles
[12:03] you know it's a sign I mean you could
[12:06] have been watching a YouTube video about
[12:08] eagles 3 days ago and then suddenly you
[12:10] see an eagle in your dream because it
[12:12] made some impression inside it doesn't
[12:14] mean God was speaking to you because an
[12:16] eagle appeared in your dream and was
[12:18] screaming
[12:20] No, your mind is filled with images and
[12:23] things that you plant in there and they
[12:26] manifest themselves. So, I'm saying to
[12:29] you, don't even believe this stuff when
[12:31] they tell you Satan is coming to you.
[12:33] Lucifer is coming to you in your dream,
[12:35] someone cast a spell on you. You're a
[12:36] child of God.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; All right? He's got no chance with you.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[12:43] &gt;&gt; Unless you say yes to something.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about.
[12:49] So the closest thing you will find to
[12:52] the devil is the spirit of lies.
[12:56] Right? That's what we told you. He does
[12:58] not take on physical forms. He cannot
[12:59] create a physical form. The things that
[13:02] occur because of fear and doubt in you
[13:05] come from influence of the devil.
[13:10] Right? And it causes your your
[13:12] imagination to conjure up images. So
[13:16] this is the scariest thing.
[13:20] People in this world today
[13:22] who are scared of the devil, Pentecostal
[13:24] Christians, Christians who have been,
[13:26] you know, brainwashed about the devil,
[13:29] they're so terrified of going to hell to
[13:31] meet the devil. You don't realize you
[13:33] meet him every day, almost every minute
[13:36] of the day.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Because he is the father of all lies. Do
[13:42] you realize that every time you meet a
[13:44] lie, you are meeting the devil?
[13:47] &gt;&gt; That's how close he is. Not under the
[13:50] ground.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; You're meeting when you're meeting a
[13:53] lie, when you're face to face with a
[13:55] lie, you are meeting the spirit of lies.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; Come in a form to direct you into
[14:02] something that is not good.
[14:07] So,
[14:09] if you truly understand all that we've
[14:11] been showing you by by now, you should
[14:14] have realized that the majority of what
[14:16] you have been told in the past about
[14:19] both God and the devil has been a
[14:22] massive elaborate lie designed to
[14:26] control you and keep you bound by other
[14:28] men. Do you understand what I just said?
[14:33] Almost everything you've heard about God
[14:35] from your religions, from philosophies,
[14:38] from books has been a lie. What you
[14:40] heard about God has been a lie. Here's
[14:43] the the frightening thing. If what you
[14:45] heard about God has been a lie, where
[14:48] did that lie come from? From the devil.
[14:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; That means the devil has been preaching
[14:53] to you about God.
[14:56] The devil has been preaching to you
[14:58] about God. In other words, telling you
[15:00] that this is God and this is how you
[15:02] must worship him. And he's got you
[15:06] believing you are worshiping God, but
[15:07] you are worshiping a lie. Do you know
[15:10] how many people are trapped by that?
[15:14] You know, there are scriptures for that,
[15:15] right? They took um the truth of who God
[15:19] is and turned him into idols and all
[15:21] kinds of things. That's in the
[15:22] scriptures, the book of Romans and many
[15:24] other places. So, you may not have
[15:26] realized it that for a while,
[15:32] excuse me, you may not have realized how
[15:35] close you have been living with lies
[15:38] and you've been waiting for answers from
[15:40] God. You pray to God. You want God to
[15:43] give you a dream or a vision. You want
[15:46] God to appear to you and give you the
[15:48] solution for a problem. You want God to
[15:51] do something for you. You want an answer
[15:52] from him. BUT THE TRUTH is right near
[15:54] you and you don't realize his presence.
[15:59] What's the problem?
[16:02] Right? Then you also know you've
[16:05] realized it. It's a feeling like you are
[16:08] not going anywhere or not progressing.
[16:11] It's that feeling that when you're
[16:12] praying to God, you're not breaking
[16:14] through. It's that feeling that when you
[16:16] ought to be more, you ought to be more
[16:19] to the message or there ought to be more
[16:22] to the message. and you're just not
[16:24] getting it or when you believe the word
[16:26] that you're hearing but there's more
[16:29] fear and more doubt in your life and you
[16:31] cannot understand why.
[16:35] What's the problem? Right? You may come
[16:38] to realize that you have been deceiving
[16:40] yourself because you have believed lies
[16:44] instead of truth. You can sit here and
[16:47] you know we can blame the past. We can
[16:48] blame other ministers we sat under. We
[16:51] can blame people for bringing us false
[16:53] doctrines. We can blame preachers. You
[16:56] can do that your whole life. You can you
[16:58] can blame anybody. You can blame your
[16:59] parents. You can blame the church that
[17:01] you're in and say, "Well, it was cultish
[17:03] and all of that and it is their fault."
[17:07] It won't do you any good to cause blame
[17:09] anywhere else.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; The question is why did you believe it?
[17:18] &gt;&gt; Right? And that's what I want to focus
[17:20] on today. Why? When you ask that
[17:23] question, it doesn't matter. You know,
[17:24] young people, you get to a place, you
[17:27] you meet some boyfriend in the world and
[17:30] and then he makes you do wrong things
[17:32] and then you blame him. The question is
[17:34] why did you believe him? Then you
[17:37] realize you can't blame another person.
[17:39] The blame falls at your feet.
[17:42] Right? The here's the point. You can
[17:45] blame pastors. You can blame preachers.
[17:48] You can blame people who brought false
[17:50] doctrines. People who did things to
[17:52] abuse you, the churches that control,
[17:55] you can blame them. But you are a free
[17:57] moral agent.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Why did you accept it? Why did you
[18:03] believe it?
[18:05] There's an answer. There's a real
[18:07] answer. And it's not one to make you
[18:10] feel bad.
[18:12] All right? You know what's the answer?
[18:16] The answer is the boogeyman
[18:21] in America or in England. The bogeyman.
[18:25] That's the answer. I can see I have your
[18:28] interested. Kids are like,
[18:32] "What is he talking about? Why did you
[18:35] believe false doctrines? Because of a
[18:37] boogeyman.
[18:41] Why did you believe lies about God?
[18:43] because of a boogeyman.
[18:46] I can hear it, brother. I want to get to
[18:48] it now. What are you talking about? All
[18:50] right.
[18:52] So, we want to start there. What is a
[18:55] boogeyman or a bogeyman? All right. It
[18:57] comes from, you can Google it. You can
[18:59] check it out for yourself. What you know
[19:02] as the devil is just a boogeyman.
[19:07] And the entire Christian world has been
[19:09] suckered into fearing it.
[19:13] All right. So, what is a boogeyman or a
[19:15] bogeyman in English? Children, you're
[19:18] listening.
[19:19] Okay. And adults who have fear and doubt
[19:23] in you, you're like 30 years old, 40
[19:26] years old, 50 years old and you're still
[19:29] scared. Why are you scared? Who put that
[19:32] fear in YOU OF WHATEVER it is? Who put
[19:36] it in you? It was put in you from a long
[19:38] time ago as you were growing. And the
[19:42] reason other humans use fear with you is
[19:46] to control you.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; All right. So the meaning of boogeyman
[19:52] is an imaginary evil monster or creature
[19:57] created by people to scare children into
[20:01] obedience.
[20:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; I say that again. What is a boogeyman?
[20:08] It is an imaginary
[20:12] evil monster or creature
[20:15] created by people to scare children into
[20:19] obedience. So how do they do this in
[20:21] times like in in England and in um
[20:24] Europe and so on many years ago? It was
[20:28] like um u where people kids were getting
[20:31] kidnapped or um bad things would happen
[20:34] or there were bandits or robbers and
[20:36] things like that. And you know little
[20:37] children can you imagine if you were in
[20:39] England and you're living in the street
[20:41] or something there's a house in the
[20:42] street and kids want to go out at night.
[20:44] They want to play. They want to run
[20:45] around. They want to run into dark
[20:47] alleys and they could be drinkers or
[20:50] drug addicts or abusers something there.
[20:52] So the mom would tell the child, "If you
[20:54] go down that street, the boogeyman's
[20:56] going to get you." What's a boogeyman,
[20:59] mom? Oh, he's so tall. He's got long
[21:02] teeth, got long hair. His eyes are so
[21:05] dark. And in the night, they shine
[21:07] yellow. And he's got long fingers with
[21:09] nails that come out. And if HE GRABS
[21:12] YOU, his nails pierce into your skin and
[21:15] POKE YOUR LUNGS AND YOUR HEART, AND
[21:17] YOU'LL SCREAM, AND IT BURNS LIKE FIRE.
[21:20] AND THE KID IS
[21:24] BOOGEYMAN.
[21:26] That's a boogeyman. Right. So everything
[21:30] you know about Satan and the devil is a
[21:33] boogeyman.
[21:36] Men and religions did that to terrify
[21:38] you.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; You know, we got a scripture that tells
[21:41] us Christ came and took away the sting
[21:44] of death, hell, and the grave. And you
[21:47] still have Christians today afraid of
[21:49] death.
[21:50] and worried about going to hell. When
[21:52] you literally had a savior who came and
[21:54] released you from the grip of it
[21:56] &gt;&gt; where you have scripture that says, "Oh
[21:58] death, where is your sting? Oh grave,
[22:00] where is your victory?"
[22:03] &gt;&gt; You know, it's like it's like a sword
[22:05] fighter, an expert sword fighter. Have
[22:07] you ever seen somebody learning to fight
[22:09] with a sword? He fights like
[22:14] what is he doing? He wants to do well
[22:17] with his sword, but he's scared of
[22:18] getting hit.
[22:21] If you're a sword fighter and you want
[22:23] to win, you have to lose the fear of
[22:25] getting hit.
[22:26] &gt;&gt; You have to be willing to take a few
[22:28] cuts
[22:29] &gt;&gt; and bruises and swipes and pokes. You
[22:32] have to go in believing in your sword
[22:35] and your skill. But if you walk in like
[22:38] this and you try to fight, you're never
[22:41] even going to get a shot in.
[22:44] That's what people are like. So, you're
[22:46] a Christian at church. Praise the Lord.
[22:48] Hallelujah. But you walk out terrified
[22:50] of death.
[22:53] What? Do you not believe that the sting
[22:55] of death is gone? Do you not believe
[22:57] there's a theophony body out there
[23:00] waiting for you to step into? Do you not
[23:03] believe that the grave has no power over
[23:05] me?
[23:06] Do we not believe that? BUT WHEN YOU
[23:09] LIVE YOUR LIFE AFRAID of the boogeyman,
[23:12] it prevents you from receiving truth.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:18] All right. So, who he actually is? Who
[23:23] is who is Satan really? Who is Lucifer?
[23:25] We told you he's he was a fallen angel
[23:28] was cast down to earth became the father
[23:31] of lies. Lost that estate and became a
[23:33] spirit and his desperate. HE'S A
[23:37] DESPERATE spirit to try and get a state
[23:40] that he could live in again. He is
[23:42] actually a spirit bound in circumstance.
[23:46] He cannot move unless there's somebody
[23:49] to believe in him so that he could
[23:52] afflict and possess and take control of
[23:54] earth. In actual fact, if all humans on
[23:58] the earth say no to him, he's harmless.
[24:06] &gt;&gt; But every bad thing in your life, you
[24:08] blame the devil.
[24:11] No, the devil's after me, brother. The
[24:12] devil did this, the devil did that, the
[24:14] devil did. The more you do that, your
[24:16] children are listening to you.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; And you're you're giving strength to the
[24:20] boogeyman.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Those are the lies put into you by
[24:27] your previous
[24:30] religions, preachers, you know,
[24:33] whatever, even your Christian religion.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:36] &gt;&gt; What do you think the Catholic Church
[24:38] wants? What do you think all these
[24:39] churches want? They want you to fear the
[24:41] devil and fire and hell so bad. So you
[24:45] keep paying them.
[24:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:47] &gt;&gt; You keep giving them money. They'll pray
[24:49] for you. They'll keep you safe. You need
[24:51] a boogeyman to have control over people.
[24:54] You you know it's like uh you know our
[24:56] Indian people, our Indian people are the
[24:58] best at being at making boogeymans.
[25:01] You know, like uh um they I remember
[25:05] they would tell um the young girls,
[25:08] don't go out at night with your hair
[25:11] open cuz the spirits will jump on you.
[25:16] Right? Some of you older sisters know
[25:17] that your parents would. In the
[25:19] meantime, from the east, it was bad
[25:23] faith for a young girl to walk out at
[25:25] night with their hair open because they
[25:27] assumed they were women of ill fame.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. They assumed you were a harlot. So
[25:31] instead of telling a young girl, you'll
[25:33] be seen as a harlot and at that time
[25:36] harlots were legitimate things and a man
[25:38] would come up and propose himself and
[25:40] say, you know what, are you open for
[25:42] business? So instead of telling them
[25:45] what the truth was, don't walk outside,
[25:48] the spirits will jump on you.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; So many things like when a when a hearse
[25:54] is going by, if you don't go run around
[25:56] and touch wood somewhere, you're going
[25:57] to be next. Remember all that. Touch
[26:01] wood.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Touch wood.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; The spirit of lies wants you to believe
[26:09] in a boogeyman. Because a person who
[26:12] believes in a boogeyman is someone that
[26:14] can be controlled by fear and law.
[26:19] If you have fear, you can be controlled
[26:21] by law. That means if you frighten a
[26:23] child enough and tell him not to go
[26:25] there because there's a boogeyman there,
[26:28] he will not go there BECAUSE HE'S
[26:30] AFRAID. AND HE'LL OBEY you not out of
[26:34] wisdom, not out of faith, but out of
[26:37] fear.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; So he's following your law out of fear
[26:41] because you created an imaginary evil.
[26:47] Now that's what Christianity in the
[26:50] beginning after Christ after Ireneius
[26:53] after the universal church came in and
[26:55] created this massive boogeyman. Now we
[26:58] need all these forms of religion to keep
[27:01] us safe from the devil.
[27:05] You know what I can tell you right now?
[27:07] people in the message who will listen to
[27:09] what I'm telling you will fight with me
[27:12] that there is a terrifying scary devil
[27:14] out there waiting to get you and they
[27:17] know they see them in visions and
[27:19] brother Baron said this and brother
[27:20] Baron they're more interested in
[27:22] believing a fictitious devil than
[27:24] actually believing the truth because
[27:26] they like the idea of a boogeyman.
[27:31] The spirit of lies wants you to believe
[27:32] in a boogeyman.
[27:34] Right? And if you are someone who can be
[27:37] controlled by fear and law, it makes you
[27:40] susceptible to human leadership.
[27:44] You will fall prey to a pastor who can
[27:46] sweet talk you, a preacher who can sweet
[27:49] talk you. YOU WILL FALL PREY TO SOMEONE
[27:52] who with convincing words tell, don't
[27:55] worry, brother. I got you. I'm praying
[27:57] for you. Don't worry. That devil's not
[27:59] going to touch you cuz I have faith for
[28:01] you.
[28:02] Who are you?
[28:05] TO HAVE FAITH FOR ME.
[28:08] Why not give him wisdom?
[28:10] Why not give him truth? Why make him
[28:13] dependent upon you?
[28:15] See, so it makes you s susceptible to
[28:18] human leadership and you'll forsake the
[28:22] leadership of the Holy Spirit for human
[28:24] leadership.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; This is the craziest thing. As long as
[28:29] there's a boogeyman, you'll be looking
[28:31] to brother so and so to keep you safe.
[28:34] Brother so and so and his church to keep
[28:36] you safe other than you being a free
[28:38] moral agent who can walk out in the
[28:39] world with no fear.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:43] &gt;&gt; IT ALSO MAKES YOU IF you believe in a
[28:46] boogeyman, you also believe in organized
[28:49] religion.
[28:51] I told you there's an answer all the
[28:54] questions. You can blame everybody else.
[28:56] Why did you believe it? All right
[28:58] people, let's zero in. Why did you
[29:01] believe it? Why did you believe the
[29:04] lies? Because of one simple
[29:07] thing in human nature, fallen human
[29:09] nature. It's called survival.
[29:13] That's what it is. It's survival. Why
[29:16] did you believe a lie? Because you
[29:18] wanted to be safe.
[29:22] That's the reason.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; It's an innocent reason. A child doesn't
[29:26] want to go there because it wants to be
[29:27] safe. So, it'll it will sit down and do
[29:31] its homework
[29:33] because if it doesn't do its homework,
[29:35] there's going to be a boogeyman.
[29:37] You know,
[29:40] in my family, sometimes my uh siblings
[29:44] make me the boogeyman.
[29:48] If they don't do it, I'll tell brother
[29:50] Al, Uncle Al. I'm the boogeyman. What am
[29:52] I going to do? I don't have fangs and
[29:54] teeth and claws. But don't worry, we'll
[29:56] tell Uncle L.
[30:00] My siblings, they must wake up now.
[30:07] I mean, I don't do that to you guys. Eh,
[30:11] um, I am the worst boogeyman my kids
[30:13] will ever see.
[30:16] And And with with my kids, there's
[30:18] nobody more frightening than me.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:24] So I I know with my boys when when they
[30:26] went to school and they'd have bullies
[30:29] and people and the teacher will shout at
[30:31] them teacher if they didn't do something
[30:33] the teacher would shout at them they
[30:35] just stand there and say okay thank you
[30:36] for letting me know how can I do this
[30:38] how can I put this right out and the
[30:40] teacher's like like I'm a failure my
[30:43] shouting why because no one can shout at
[30:45] them as bad as I do
[30:49] that's it they know that no one is more
[30:51] scarier than me. Well, now they they're
[30:53] grown up and they're my buddies. But
[30:55] back then, my voice was alpha voice. So
[30:59] there no teacher, no bully, no outside
[31:01] person, no not even the devil was
[31:03] scarier than me.
[31:06] And you know, my wife told me something
[31:08] when she when uh when the boys were
[31:10] growing up and we were discussing, we
[31:12] were talking about the message and the
[31:13] Bible. And she said to me, she said to
[31:15] me, "When you're growing up as a child,"
[31:18] because she's a teacher. And she was
[31:19] explaining to me, she said, "Kids always
[31:21] need something to look at in their minds
[31:23] when they're about to do something
[31:25] wrong." And uh she said, "There's only
[31:27] two things your child sees.
[31:31] You can teach them about God, but
[31:33] there's mommy's face.
[31:36] So, she she knew that as they're growing
[31:38] up, she didn't even have to say much,
[31:40] but mommy's face with disappointment.
[31:43] And you can ask these guys, there's
[31:45] nothing that wounds them worse than
[31:47] mommy's disappointed face. Not even my
[31:50] scary voice wounds them any. They will
[31:52] fall down and beg at her feet if her
[31:55] face shows them she's I'm disappointed
[31:57] in you. That's how bad she she was
[31:59] right. She was right. There's God and
[32:02] mommy's face.
[32:05] Absolutely right. I understand the first
[32:07] gospel now.
[32:10] But here's the thing, saints. When you
[32:12] get trapped by a boogeyman, it is when
[32:16] you feel safe in religion and with rules
[32:19] and laws. Like you got to ask yourself,
[32:22] why would message people who have been
[32:25] brought the open book want to be under
[32:28] an oppressive rulership?
[32:32] Why would you want to submit to a pastor
[32:36] who is abusing you, molesting you
[32:39] spiritually, controlling your life,
[32:42] controlling your marriage, your
[32:44] household? Why would you do that?
[32:46] Because you believe he's keeping you
[32:48] safe. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON. THAT'S THE
[32:50] ONLY REASON A free moral agent would
[32:53] succumb.
[32:56] So the reason you believe all the lies
[32:58] is because you wanted to be safe. The
[33:00] reason you believe the lies about God
[33:02] and the devil and a lot of things in the
[33:05] message is because you want to feel
[33:07] safe. What's safety? I want to be in the
[33:09] rapture. Brother Al, I want to make it
[33:11] in the rapture. I want to be there in
[33:13] heaven on the other side. You know,
[33:15] sometimes, and I heard this because I've
[33:17] been in the church my whole life. I
[33:19] would even hear like u other brothers
[33:23] and sisters in the church wanting to
[33:24] sort their children out. They'll they'll
[33:26] have to say, "If you do this, I'm going
[33:28] to call the pastor." Now, the pastor
[33:31] becomes a boogeyman or I'm going to call
[33:33] the deacon. If you don't behave, I'm
[33:35] going to call Like, what is the problem
[33:37] with you as a parent?
[33:39] Why must the pastor and the deacon be
[33:41] the boogeyman? Why must the church be
[33:43] the boogeyman? Like if you do this, I'm
[33:46] going to bring you in front of the
[33:47] church and make you confess it. That's
[33:49] not the church is the bomb and Gilead.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Why are you making the church the
[33:54] boogeyman? Why should your child be
[33:56] afraid when they stand and sit among
[33:59] believers and feel insecure and and
[34:01] afraid that people are watching them and
[34:03] go out there into the malls and see a
[34:05] brother or sister and feel like I need
[34:07] to hide or something? Why does a a free
[34:10] moral agent need to be bound like that?
[34:17] See, I didn't grow up like that. Maybe
[34:19] it's the way I am that I don't care
[34:22] where I am, what I am doing, and whether
[34:24] you see me and I got no issue telling
[34:27] you I'm here because of this and I'm
[34:30] I've got no fear for people. I've got no
[34:32] fear for anybody. There is no boogeyman.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; It's fake. Amen.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; It's a lie.
[34:41] &gt;&gt; You were made to be afraid of going to
[34:44] hell. After we taught you the story of
[34:46] God and man, is there is there an ounce
[34:49] of a possibility of you being in hell?
[34:52] No. You come from him. You go back to
[34:55] him.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[34:56] &gt;&gt; Hell is not an option.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Hell does not scare me.
[35:02] How about a burning for eternity? It's
[35:05] not going to happen.
[35:07] Right. Uh, are you afraid of making God
[35:10] angry?
[35:12] Do you think God gets angry with you?
[35:16] Who told you that?
[35:19] Do you think you are going to fall into
[35:21] the devil's traps? Do you really think
[35:24] Satan is waiting out there setting traps
[35:26] for you?
[35:29] No. You make those traps.
[35:32] You chose to go that way. You made those
[35:35] decisions. All there is in the world is
[35:38] the spirit of lies that works in mankind
[35:42] that produces all the filth. And you
[35:45] choose to do this.
[35:50] It's, you know, what we call a copout.
[35:53] You understand that? You don't want to
[35:56] take responsibility for the choice you
[35:58] made. So, you blame the devil. Oh, the
[36:01] devil set a trap for me, brother. You
[36:03] know, I was going there. had good
[36:04] intentions. No, you knew why you were
[36:06] going there.
[36:08] You knew everything about this thing
[36:10] situation.
[36:13] Don't cop out. It's not THE DEVIL THAT
[36:16] TRAPPED YOU.
[36:18] SEE, that's what happens. And then you
[36:21] you come and give a testimony. The devil
[36:23] did this, the devil, and then you need
[36:25] our sympathy and we fall for it. Oh,
[36:28] shame. Poor guy. You know, it was bad
[36:29] luck. Wasn't bad luck. Was a bad choice.
[36:32] just own it.
[36:35] Bad decision of, you know, of having
[36:37] things. You're afraid of of having
[36:39] things in your house that invite the
[36:41] devil in.
[36:44] You're afraid of having things in your
[36:45] house that keep God out.
[36:49] What is there that can keep God out?
[36:54] H anything. He's God.
[36:58] He He literally has caught blanch to go
[37:01] wherever he pleases because he's God. He
[37:03] created everything. Is there something
[37:06] in your house that you can you can use
[37:09] um
[37:11] satanic symbols?
[37:13] You can I mean with the powders like all
[37:16] the witches and wizards of this world
[37:18] create, if God wants to walk in their
[37:20] man, there's not nothing going to stop
[37:22] him.
[37:24] &gt;&gt; Nothing. HE'S GOD. GET OVER IT. RIGHT?
[37:29] There's nothing CAN STOP HIM. THE ONLY
[37:31] WAY YOU let a devil in is by accepting a
[37:34] lie.
[37:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Everything in this world, see this? This
[37:40] is a TV.
[37:43] It's made by This is a TV. This is not
[37:45] just a screen. This is a TV. I saw it
[37:47] apps on there. It's got stuff on there.
[37:50] You saw that? It's here in our place of
[37:52] worship.
[37:55] Is it you? You you know all the
[37:56] spiritual message people. Oh, it's
[37:59] created by the devil.
[38:01] So is this. So is this. So is the phone.
[38:06] So is the guitar. So is the piano. It's
[38:09] all created by people who were
[38:10] influenced by something else. So how
[38:14] many things are you going to stay away
[38:15] from?
[38:17] H was your house built by sanctified
[38:20] people?
[38:22] Were your carpets laid by sanctified
[38:24] people? Was the tiling in your bathroom
[38:26] done by sanctified people? Were the taps
[38:29] that you drink from made by sanctified
[38:31] people? So the devil is in everything.
[38:34] Then
[38:37] here we are using this thing which we
[38:39] call a TV to project the message from.
[38:48] You know some people know brother
[38:50] Alistister you know what you must do you
[38:52] must get rid of this thing put a
[38:54] projector screen here and use a
[38:55] projector. This is evil. Brother man
[38:57] said legalist brother said he blow it up
[38:59] with a shotgun.
[39:02] Man, you better buy some shotgun shells.
[39:06] You need a lot to blow up everywhere you
[39:09] go.
[39:12] Boogeyman.
[39:14] See, I'm sorry to say it this way. That
[39:17] was all a massive pile of man-made
[39:20] garbage.
[39:22] It is time for you to break loose from
[39:24] your self-made prison of false security
[39:28] and let the light come shining in.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; I tell you, when you get rid of that
[39:33] boogeyman, you become the lightest
[39:35] person, free,
[39:38] stressfree,
[39:40] right? You don't have to worry about
[39:42] things and stress about things and hurt
[39:44] yourself in the process. and then blame
[39:46] the devil.
[39:49] Okay. So, what does brother Brandham say
[39:52] about the devil? What does the prophet
[39:53] say about the devil? That's where we're
[39:54] going to first. Some legalists will say
[39:57] about brother Al. Brother Brandham said
[39:59] the devil is a person.
[40:02] That means what does person mean to you?
[40:04] Does that mean he's real flesh and
[40:06] blood? So, is the Holy Spirit a person?
[40:10] Do you see the Holy Spirit walking
[40:12] around in his own designated body?
[40:15] Why do you want the devil to be a person
[40:18] that is scary?
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Because you want to be safe from him.
[40:24] You want your fear to be something that
[40:26] you can see and identify and run away
[40:29] from.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; scaredy-cat.
[40:36] You have the Holy Spirit and you run
[40:38] away from things.
[40:40] Walk at it. FACE IT.
[40:43] THAT'S WHAT we need with sons and
[40:44] daughters of God. We need to face our
[40:47] fears.
[40:50] Look at what brother says. The devil is
[40:52] a believer.
[40:55] &gt;&gt; 1953. Well, not just 953. So he's the
[40:59] Bible says he says the Bible says he
[41:01] believes and trembles.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; So he says he's a believer. He of course
[41:06] he was created an angel. He he actually
[41:09] BELIEVES GOD'S WORD. YOU COULD SAY THIS
[41:11] way more than other people believe
[41:14] &gt;&gt; because he knows. Think about it. When
[41:16] Christ came and and those devils WERE
[41:18] SAYING TO CHRIST, JESUS, THOU SON OF
[41:20] GOD,
[41:22] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE YOU TORMENTING US? THE DEVILS
[41:24] believe Christ was a son of God and the
[41:26] people he came to wouldn't believe it.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he said he's a believer,
[41:32] &gt;&gt; right? Number two, he's a perverter, not
[41:35] a creator. He cannot create. 956. Number
[41:38] three, he's a tormentor to decrease your
[41:42] three score and 10. He uses this uh
[41:45] statement. I think it's in demonology
[41:47] where he's speaking about the physical
[41:49] realm and he's talking about illnesses
[41:51] and disease.
[41:52] Uh he says the devil is a great powerful
[41:56] force, but he's under the power of God.
[42:00] HE'S A GREAT POWERFUL FORCE, BUT HE'S
[42:02] UNDER GOD'S SUBJECTION. There's no way
[42:04] he can come above God's subjection. That
[42:07] means if you have the word, what power
[42:09] does the devil have over you? Because
[42:11] he's under God. Doesn't matter how great
[42:13] a force he is.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; Um this is not just one place but uh
[42:19] number five, brother M said the devil is
[42:22] a spirit not a biting creature. Now let
[42:25] me explain. There was somebody who um I
[42:29] can't remember this the story all the
[42:30] specifics of the story but
[42:34] uh you know the great evangelist aa
[42:36] Allen the Ram speaks about him he wrote
[42:40] a book uh and in there he was um
[42:44] recounting some story so there was a
[42:47] woman or I don't know if a Allen wrote
[42:50] the book I think to my if my memory is
[42:52] certainly correct brother M was kind of
[42:54] saying that it may not have been a a
[42:55] Allen who wrote the book, but people
[42:57] were speaking against him for saying
[42:59] this. It could have been somebody else.
[43:01] Anyway, that's that's the that's not re
[43:03] really the story. The story is there was
[43:05] a woman who was
[43:08] uh claiming that there was a devil
[43:11] afflicting her and it was biting her,
[43:14] leaving bite marks on her body. Brother
[43:17] Madam said the devil is a spirit and
[43:20] does not do that.
[43:26] I could tell you what what was probably
[43:28] happening with that woman, but we have
[43:29] kids present,
[43:31] right? I don't want to threaten them
[43:33] with the real boogeyman of this world.
[43:37] Those could have been self-inflicted
[43:39] wounds or something someone else was
[43:41] doing. And because she was in trauma,
[43:44] she accepted the lie of the boogeyman.
[43:46] Yeah,
[43:48] &gt;&gt; it's easier to do that and blame the
[43:50] devil than to admit that something else
[43:52] is happening in your life. And brother
[43:55] Vanom calls it out and said, "The devil
[43:57] is a spirit, not a biting creature."
[44:01] &gt;&gt; So I'm telling you, I didn't make this
[44:03] up, right?
[44:05] &gt;&gt; Okay. Number six, he says, this is where
[44:07] he said, "The devil is a person, not
[44:10] just an evil thought." Because at that
[44:12] time there were some Christians and
[44:14] people were saying the devil is just an
[44:15] evil thought that comes into your head
[44:17] that's a devil right no brother said he
[44:21] is a person in other words there is a
[44:23] personality to it right
[44:28] um so I put them two together a spirit
[44:31] in one place he says he's a spirit the
[44:33] other place he's a person so how can he
[44:35] be two different things right because
[44:37] people will say he's a person he's a
[44:39] physical being that's under the ground
[44:42] because brother Mam said he's a person.
[44:44] He's down there in the depths of the
[44:46] caverns in the caves of the earth hiding
[44:48] IN THE DARKNESS OF FIRE.
[44:52] You know, humans really want to be scary
[44:56] for some reason. Why not just be good?
[44:59] Why not be nice? You know, except to
[45:02] deal with children.
[45:06] A person, the devil is a person. The
[45:08] devil is a spirit. Brother Rem says this
[45:11] in Greatest Battle 1962. He has no hoofs
[45:14] and a tail,
[45:17] right?
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; So, you agree? I brother Al didn't just
[45:21] make all these things up, right? It's in
[45:22] the message. He says the devil is a
[45:25] deceiver in the message things that are
[45:26] to be. He says the devil is a squatter
[45:29] who doesn't legally own anything.
[45:34] Oh, if children of God could take that.
[45:36] I love this. He's a vulture feeding on
[45:39] his own kingdom.
[45:42] That's powerful. You know, in other
[45:45] words, the the very people that the
[45:47] spirit of lies traps, the devil is
[45:49] feeding on them,
[45:51] right? In in other words, like, you
[45:53] know, like a king who's abusing his own
[45:56] subjects. It's terrible, right? And
[46:00] lastly, I mean, there's more. I just
[46:02] chose 11. a liar. Even when he comes
[46:06] with any light, it's a lie.
[46:10] There it is. So, anything you want to
[46:12] know about the devil, this is really it,
[46:15] right? And when you look at all this,
[46:17] it's really not that scary when you have
[46:20] the word of God.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; When you have the truth, every single
[46:23] thing that you see there just does not
[46:25] make you afraid.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Right? So
[46:30] um knowing all this, what I want to do
[46:33] next is to help us identify if we can
[46:37] use what brother did to identify what
[46:39] the devil is. Right? The next thing
[46:41] we've got to do is identify the spirit
[46:43] of God because there are going to be
[46:46] many people who will come and try to to
[46:49] project to you what God is in different
[46:52] forms. And this is another problem,
[46:55] right? Because in churches, Pentecostal
[46:58] denominational message churches, they
[47:01] are uh telling you things like this is
[47:05] God.
[47:07] Man,
[47:09] there sometimes I hear things just want
[47:10] to make make me want to cry to hear
[47:13] people that are so bound in these
[47:16] things, you know? It's like um I've
[47:18] watched people and I and I just know I'm
[47:21] I'm sitting there listening to them and
[47:23] in my mind I I know you're a fraud,
[47:26] you know, when I hear them say, "Hold
[47:29] on. There's a presence here." Did you
[47:31] feel that?
[47:33] Did you feel that? Did you Did you see
[47:35] what happened right there? Oh, I just
[47:37] know you are a psychopath, my friend,
[47:40] and you are not getting me. Like, did
[47:42] you feel that something happened right
[47:43] now? Right now. There are some people
[47:46] who have a genuine gift and will drop
[47:48] down, but it will come with humility.
[47:51] That's the test. It comes with humility
[47:53] and they'll either walk out of the room
[47:55] and come and call you aside and tell
[47:56] you, "Hey, brother, the Lord told me
[47:58] something and I got to tell it to you.
[48:00] It's in my heart right now." You can you
[48:02] can see there's no uh bragging. There's
[48:06] no trying to take control of people or
[48:08] control room. There's no um uh uh pride
[48:13] because there's with the true spirit of
[48:15] God, there's humility in it. There's a
[48:17] lamblike nature. There's no reason to
[48:21] dominate a situation.
[48:25] So, let's identify the spirit of God,
[48:27] right? So, it's so easy for us it's it's
[48:29] actually easy for us to identify the
[48:32] spirit of lies in this world. I can do
[48:34] exercises with you and tell you when you
[48:37] go to um
[48:40] uh those of you who will go and buy some
[48:42] KFC after the service
[48:45] right for lunch
[48:47] uh and uh you go there and I ask you as
[48:50] you go in tell me everything you see
[48:52] there that is lies
[48:54] and really look at it you're going to
[48:56] find it in the advertising
[49:00] go look at it for longer then think of
[49:03] What in that advertising is making you
[49:05] feel like I need this right now?
[49:09] I have to have it. That's a devil.
[49:13] That's a devil. Because they're using
[49:16] everything in a way of propaganda. The
[49:19] picture is wrong.
[49:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you know? Do you know like on
[49:24] your advertisements like even in your
[49:26] your Willies Wilwards catalog and you
[49:28] see there you see a steak
[49:31] and it's got these black marks on it and
[49:33] it's juicy and it's actually a raw
[49:36] steak. They poured oil over it. They
[49:38] took a hot stick with bars on it and
[49:40] burnt it and then took a picture.
[49:44] It's actually a disgusting raw steak,
[49:46] uncooked. And then they put some nice
[49:48] stuff around it to take the picture for
[49:50] the advertisement. And then you when you
[49:52] look at that and you think, "Oh, honey,
[49:55] go buy it. We got to make this." It
[49:57] never comes out like that.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; It never looks like that. You imagine
[50:01] the taste. You imagine it on your plate.
[50:05] You imagine what it feels like going
[50:07] down. You imagine the satisfaction.
[50:10] It was all a lie.
[50:13] They lied from the inception on the
[50:16] picture. It was a raw, DISGUSTING,
[50:18] PROBABLY STALE STEAK. It may not even
[50:21] have been any steak. It could even have
[50:24] been a prop
[50:26] &gt;&gt; plastic. That's right.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; That's how much of lies there is out
[50:32] there in the world today. Ask I pity any
[50:36] of you people who work in advertising
[50:38] cuz you know what? You're working with
[50:39] the devil.
[50:43] Sorry. You know how much of lies you
[50:45] have to put out in the public, right?
[50:47] You know, on all those labels they put
[50:49] on water bottles and all those things.
[50:51] They tell you what this contains and
[50:52] that contains. You know how many lies
[50:54] there are in there?
[50:57] And you look, you stand there. I love it
[50:59] when I see how people stand there in
[51:01] front of the store reading all this
[51:02] important like you understand
[51:04] everything.
[51:05] H so many mills you have sodium bio blah
[51:09] blah blah blah.
[51:11] Sounds good.
[51:13] They must know their stuff and you know
[51:16] your stuff. So, we're all good. And you
[51:18] go there and take the stuff and then
[51:20] you're killing your liver and your
[51:21] kidneys with all these things you don't
[51:23] even know. YOU'RE ABUSING SOMETHING YOU
[51:25] KNOW NOTHING ABOUT. But you accepted the
[51:27] lie.
[51:29] So we we can go in this world. What I'm
[51:31] trying to say to you, the devil is more
[51:34] visible in this world than God is.
[51:37] The only places that are hardest to see
[51:40] the devil are actually in churches
[51:44] because people assume everything in the
[51:46] church is holy. And here's the truth.
[51:50] Churches are where the level five demons
[51:53] are.
[51:56] The biggest lie. And I'm not telling you
[51:59] something that's not biblical. Yeah,
[52:01] &gt;&gt; the serpent was in the garden of Eden
[52:04] right next to the tree of life,
[52:08] &gt;&gt; right? You can identify where you can
[52:11] find, you know, the spirit of truth
[52:13] today. You you can't really identify it
[52:15] anywhere in civilization,
[52:17] right? Can you identify in the world
[52:21] where you can see God,
[52:24] where you can see truth? Tell me where
[52:28] in school, university, work, your
[52:32] neighbors.
[52:33] Where can you tell me you can see
[52:36] absolute truth in the world today? It's
[52:40] so hard to find, right? The only places
[52:43] that are hardest to see lies is in the
[52:45] church. And why is that? Because that's
[52:49] where the enemy needs to have the
[52:51] greatest lies.
[52:53] Okay? So remember, anything that has the
[52:56] spirit of truth in this world reflects
[52:59] who God is. Are you with us?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; There are only two places you will ever
[53:05] find truth in this world. And that is in
[53:09] nature and the word of God. Nothing
[53:12] else.
[53:14] That's the reason it's so hard
[53:17] today because 99.9%
[53:21] of the things you come in contact with
[53:23] is lies.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; Small percent is actually true.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; See and and you can see the way you are
[53:31] you are programmed
[53:34] like if you leave the service today.
[53:40] Okay, we we came into to the to the
[53:42] church today.
[53:45] You drove by these beautiful trees,
[53:49] birds.
[53:50] You don't notice them. You don't even
[53:52] look at them anymore.
[53:54] You may you are afraid of beautiful
[53:57] insects.
[53:59] You see a grasshoppen.
[54:02] And yet that's more God than anything
[54:05] you will ever see made by man.
[54:09] You actually recoil from nature
[54:12] and yet there's more God to be seen in
[54:15] there than anything created by man.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; You drove here today and you barely
[54:22] noticed nature.
[54:25] If you grew up in my family, you would
[54:27] have stopped to look at a bird. The
[54:30] brother Clive was telling how frustrated
[54:31] he was with me, you know, bird watching.
[54:35] But why? Because we grew up
[54:38] understanding that in nature you see
[54:41] God, in the word you see God. Uh but
[54:45] with kids today, they are going to tend
[54:47] towards technology and everything
[54:50] man-made and never even grow up knowing
[54:53] a single bird's name or the name of
[54:55] other creatures. I had I had books in my
[54:59] shelf when I was a teenager to learn how
[55:02] to identify different species of grass
[55:06] and flowers and insects. You guys will
[55:10] grow up never even knowing there's many
[55:12] different types of grass. You won't know
[55:14] their names. How many of you know what's
[55:16] elephant grass and that it's so sharp
[55:19] it'll slice through your skin? And we
[55:22] get it here in Africa. And um um sugar
[55:26] cane. Did you know sugarcane is a type
[55:28] of grass?
[55:30] Young people, did you know it's when you
[55:33] eat sugarcane, it's it's grass?
[55:36] Yeah. It's just a whole lot of grass
[55:37] that hardened up into a stem and a
[55:39] stalk. There's so many things in this
[55:42] world that that shows you things. That's
[55:45] truth. It has God IN IT AND YOU DON'T
[55:48] WANT TO look at it.
[55:51] There are only imagine as saints there
[55:54] are only two place two places in the
[55:56] world you will find God today easily
[55:58] available nature and the word of God
[56:06] and we go and mess it all up. We mess up
[56:10] nature.
[56:12] We mess up the ocean, the forest, the
[56:15] land, the air.
[56:19] This is unbelievable. and we're supposed
[56:21] to be Adam
[56:23] H. can see how far we've fallen. So, I'm
[56:27] going to say this respectfully,
[56:31] as respectfully as I can.
[56:34] The word of God of the past was the
[56:38] Bible.
[56:42] The word in the Bible is the absolute
[56:46] truth
[56:48] and its principles and its spirit. The
[56:51] principles of everything in the written
[56:53] word and the spirit in the written word
[56:56] will go on for eternity.
[56:58] But everything written in the Bible was
[57:00] the word of God for the past.
[57:03] Right? There is no doubt about that.
[57:07] But because times and civilizations
[57:09] change, the practical things and the
[57:12] ways of worship are no longer the same.
[57:16] You cannot live by exactly what the
[57:20] Bible says in today's life because life
[57:22] is different.
[57:24] Right? The church in Irenius's time had
[57:28] its own truth
[57:31] and uh it was applicable for their day.
[57:34] the the the people in Luther's day had
[57:37] their truth that God revealed to them
[57:40] for their day and it was applicable for
[57:42] their day. Are you with us?
[57:45] &gt;&gt; The people in Irene's day could not live
[57:48] by the truth for our day. It would kill
[57:50] them.
[57:52] They were not ready for it. Are you with
[57:55] us? Amen.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; I you know I want to I want to explain
[57:58] that to you to make you understand a
[58:01] little bit more about God
[58:04] and about truth. You've heard it said in
[58:06] the Bible no man can look at God he'll
[58:08] and and live. No man could see God and
[58:11] live. You understand that right?
[58:15] Let me explain this to you. Do you know
[58:18] what it is like to give a human truth?
[58:23] absolute truth. He might kill himself
[58:26] with it.
[58:28] He might die. Let's make you understand
[58:30] that in a human way.
[58:33] You think you can just go and confess
[58:37] some kind of truth to someone. Are you
[58:40] aware that they can handle that truth?
[58:47] Do you know what you're doing? Do you
[58:50] know what you're doing when you tell
[58:51] someone? You've got to know that someone
[58:53] can actually handle the truth. Let me
[58:56] give you an example.
[58:58] You and I give you probably the most
[59:00] terrible example.
[59:02] You know, you're about to go and tell
[59:04] someone that the person they love the
[59:07] most has passed away. How do you do it?
[59:11] How do you do it? You know what's the
[59:14] truth? Hey, listen. Your husband just
[59:17] died.
[59:20] They'll have a crashing meltdown in
[59:22] front of you and probably hate you for
[59:24] the rest of their life. So, in other
[59:25] words, you're going to find a way to
[59:28] prepare them to receive the truth.
[59:31] Agreed?
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Because just coming out and bringing the
[59:33] truth is going to crush them. It might
[59:35] kill them. You come out and say that to
[59:37] like somebody and they might have a
[59:40] heart attack, literally get killed by
[59:42] the truth.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Do you understand me?
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. Humans are
[59:47] living in a condition where they can
[59:50] barely even handle truth
[59:53] and you have to you have to prepare them
[59:56] to receive it. Can you imagine telling
[59:59] Ireanius the truth of this day? They are
[1:00:03] not prepared to they'll kill themselves
[1:00:05] by it.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; And so it is with every other day. The
[1:00:11] message is the place where you find full
[1:00:14] present tense truth for today.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; Young people, those of you who want to
[1:00:19] get baptized, listen up.
[1:00:22] The message is the only place today you
[1:00:25] will find full present tense truth that
[1:00:29] there is on earth today. And then more
[1:00:32] of it is going to be found in the saints
[1:00:34] who believe the truth.
[1:00:37] More is going to be revealed through the
[1:00:38] saints who believe the truth. Now you
[1:00:41] know from those of you who even try and
[1:00:43] tell this message to people, they are
[1:00:46] not even prepared to hear it.
[1:00:49] And if YOU JUST GO AND TELL THEM
[1:00:51] something and they're not prepared, you
[1:00:53] hurt them.
[1:00:55] You can kill them.
[1:00:58] Like for example, somebody who is really
[1:01:01] bound in sin, really done something
[1:01:03] wrong, really backsliden. That's not the
[1:01:05] place to start by telling them actually
[1:01:09] what you've done,
[1:01:11] you know, and and bring out the word and
[1:01:13] show them how much condemnation. You
[1:01:15] don't want to start there even though
[1:01:17] it's the truth.
[1:01:19] You want to start with a place where
[1:01:20] they can handle the truth.
[1:01:23] Agreed?
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; So it is a thing in this message. One of
[1:01:29] the ways we know that it is truth is
[1:01:31] that are you listening?
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:34] How do you know in this world when
[1:01:37] something is true?
[1:01:40] Think about it. How do you know when
[1:01:43] something is actually the truth?
[1:01:46] When it is the most rejected thing.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I already told you people
[1:01:53] want to believe more in a boogeyman.
[1:01:57] When something is the truth, it is the
[1:02:00] most rejected thing,
[1:02:04] right? The most persecuted thing, the
[1:02:07] most hated of all beliefs. Even in
[1:02:10] Christianity,
[1:02:12] this message is still and going to be
[1:02:14] the most rejected and most hated thing
[1:02:17] among Christians today. Do you know
[1:02:18] that?
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; Nobody in the world is all going to get
[1:02:24] together and hate the Catholics.
[1:02:27] They're already starting to love them
[1:02:29] more.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Nobody's going to get together and all
[1:02:31] hate the Mormons or all hate even the
[1:02:34] Amish people or all Nobody's going to do
[1:02:37] that. But why? Because everybody's used
[1:02:41] to a boogeyman of some kind and nobody's
[1:02:45] willing to listen to the truth.
[1:02:47] Everybody say, you know, it's okay. You
[1:02:49] can you can dress like this. You can you
[1:02:51] can have this hanging on your life. You
[1:02:53] can believe this. You can do that. And
[1:02:55] you can come to our church. Don't worry.
[1:02:57] GOD IS LOVE. GOD IS WITH US. YOU KNOW,
[1:02:59] HE'S OKAY with this situation. He's okay
[1:03:02] with no. But if you tell them the truth,
[1:03:05] uh, this is too much for me. I'm leaving
[1:03:06] this church.
[1:03:08] Am I right? They're not going to accept
[1:03:11] it because nobody wants the truth. They
[1:03:14] say they do, but when you tell them,
[1:03:16] they don't like it. So when you present
[1:03:19] actual truth to them, it's going to be
[1:03:21] rejected. It's going to be hated.
[1:03:26] Are you with me?
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; So when you see anything done in God's
[1:03:30] name that is being violently and
[1:03:33] viferously rejected, you know that all
[1:03:36] hell is against it. Are you still with
[1:03:39] me?
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Okay, think of it that in today's
[1:03:44] spiritual environment, people are
[1:03:47] actually desiring to turn back to God.
[1:03:49] There are so many people. There are You
[1:03:51] read in the news, you read in
[1:03:53] newspapers, you read in magazines.
[1:03:56] Well, I don't think many of you young
[1:03:58] people read much anymore except on your
[1:03:59] phones, but I suppose you'd see it there
[1:04:02] on YouTube and whatever. There are all
[1:04:04] these celebrities looking for God now,
[1:04:08] right? They spent their lives
[1:04:11] high in another spirit.
[1:04:16] Now they're looking for the Holy Spirit
[1:04:18] suddenly. What's happening?
[1:04:20] Many of these fellows who enjoyed their
[1:04:22] youth in their 30s and 40s,
[1:04:25] you know, just philandering,
[1:04:28] fornicating, adulterating, all of that,
[1:04:31] drinking, smoking. Now, suddenly they
[1:04:33] reach 50, 60, and realizing, hey, I'm
[1:04:35] getting old. What's going to happen?
[1:04:37] Death is coming. I need God help. But
[1:04:40] they still want a God that's convenient,
[1:04:44] right? So, they're going to go to a
[1:04:46] church where they don't preach long like
[1:04:48] brother Al,
[1:04:50] right? They want it must be like a
[1:04:52] 15-minute sermon. The people must not be
[1:04:54] uncultured. They must be able to fit,
[1:04:56] you know, my security detail, my uh
[1:04:59] family, the way I they must treat me
[1:05:01] like royalty when I come in. They want a
[1:05:03] convenient God.
[1:05:08] Today's spiritual environment. The thing
[1:05:11] is, what still points out is like what
[1:05:13] Paul says, the fact that you know that
[1:05:17] you are supposed to do something good
[1:05:19] and you're not doing it is you're
[1:05:20] proving it to be the truth.
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; You're saying the law is good. The fact
[1:05:25] that you don't want to do that and go
[1:05:28] ahead and do it anyway, you are proving
[1:05:30] the law to be truth.
[1:05:33] So in today's environment where people
[1:05:35] are desiring to turn back to God but in
[1:05:38] the desire and here's the problem right
[1:05:40] are you with ME WHILE DESIRING God
[1:05:44] there's another desire that's driving
[1:05:46] them what is it the desire to feel
[1:05:50] safe.
[1:05:53] So when you're desiring God but you also
[1:05:55] have the desire to feel safe you are
[1:05:57] going to move towards a lie about God.
[1:06:01] You are going to a false doctrine. You
[1:06:03] are going to a false belief. You are
[1:06:06] going to a false Christian belief
[1:06:09] because you're COMBINING THE DESIRE FOR
[1:06:11] God with the desire to feel safe.
[1:06:15] That's a problem. You're going to accept
[1:06:17] the boogeyman.
[1:06:19] So, how can you identify the spirit of
[1:06:20] truth today? How can you know when God
[1:06:22] is speaking to you and it's not a lie?
[1:06:24] The legalist will will say, "Well,
[1:06:26] brother, it must tie up with THE BIBLE.
[1:06:28] THAT'S HOW I will know it's the truth.
[1:06:30] Do you know that the enemy has more
[1:06:32] experience with the Bible than you?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; More experience than you have even lived
[1:06:39] on earth.
[1:06:40] You think you just came into the message
[1:06:42] and you've been reading your Bible for
[1:06:44] 10 years and suddenly you can check it
[1:06:46] up with the word.
[1:06:48] Huh? This guy has has experience with
[1:06:53] man from before your great great great
[1:06:55] great grandfather was born.
[1:06:58] He already knows how you think. It's
[1:07:00] already genetically encoded in you. The
[1:07:03] boogeyman came pre-programmed.
[1:07:07] YOU CAME OUT AS A LITTLE BABY not even
[1:07:10] KNOWING THE WORLD ALREADY TERRIFIED.
[1:07:14] You know little babies when they're in
[1:07:16] the mom's womb and they're growing and
[1:07:18] sometimes when someone bangs a door they
[1:07:21] jump. How do they get the fear in in
[1:07:23] them? Because they learned it from mom.
[1:07:25] because mom jumped.
[1:07:28] Yeah. And then every time a door bangs,
[1:07:30] they now jump because they're learning.
[1:07:33] They're actually picking up fear from
[1:07:35] her while they're there. And then they
[1:07:38] come out in the out of the womb. They're
[1:07:40] born. They're little cute little
[1:07:42] smelling little aliens. And then the
[1:07:45] door bangs AND AH
[1:07:48] TERRIFIED. And they must hugged and
[1:07:50] cuddled and soothed. And where did the
[1:07:53] fear come from? It's already programmed
[1:07:55] into you. YOU GOT USED to a boogeyman
[1:07:58] before you even knew how to spell it.
[1:08:03] I'm trying to make it as real as
[1:08:05] possible. So you legalist brothers who
[1:08:08] come and tell me TIE UP WITH THE BIBLE.
[1:08:11] WHY DO YOU WANT IT TIE UP WITH THE
[1:08:12] BIBLE? BECAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID.
[1:08:15] You're afraid to be wrong. You want to
[1:08:19] be safe. WHY MUST IT TIE UP WITH THE
[1:08:21] BIBLE? WHY MUST YOU HAVE TO GO BACK TO
[1:08:23] THE BIBLE AND check it up? WHY CAN YOU
[1:08:26] NOT HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT to know?
[1:08:31] You're supposed to be at a place where
[1:08:33] in Hebrews 5 where you are those who are
[1:08:36] eating strong meat who have your senses
[1:08:39] exercised to know both good and evil.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; But no, listen, it's good practice when
[1:08:47] you're a young person growing up in the
[1:08:48] message. Check it up with the word. You
[1:08:51] know what that means, right? You don't
[1:08:53] have to physically go. If you have to go
[1:08:56] and check up everything everybody says
[1:08:58] in the Bible, you need like 5,000 years
[1:09:01] to live here.
[1:09:05] Stop making that excuse.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; You need the author.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Because the author is going to tell you
[1:09:11] that doesn't sound right.
[1:09:13] That's the truth. Amen.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; That doesn't sound right.
[1:09:18] Amen. So this legalistic idea of you'll
[1:09:21] know what's true. Listen, come on, STOP
[1:09:25] IT. THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE who take lies
[1:09:28] by checking it up with the Bible.
[1:09:32] The preacher will will preach something
[1:09:34] at you and in it is a subtle perfumed
[1:09:40] crafted lie and it fits with something
[1:09:43] in the Bible and you accept it and
[1:09:45] swallow it whole
[1:09:47] but you believe it because you checked
[1:09:50] it up with the Bible. So
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; because I've been preaching this message
[1:09:55] for 25 years,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; saints
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; and and it feels like many times you're
[1:09:59] you're hitting a brick wall with people
[1:10:01] like you just can't get through. Have
[1:10:03] you had those moments?
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; You just can't get through. You got the
[1:10:06] saying we can't drill through the wood,
[1:10:09] right?
[1:10:11] So do you know the enemy has more
[1:10:14] experience with the Bible? Brother man
[1:10:15] tells you that. Do you know that
[1:10:17] anything anything in the message can be
[1:10:20] manipulated by a white horse rider?
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; To tie up with the Bible. You can make
[1:10:27] anything tie up with the Bible. You can
[1:10:30] count seven things here and suddenly
[1:10:32] you're excited.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Because it's seven.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Did you notice why WHY BROTHER AL WAS
[1:10:38] PREACHING THERE were seven screws there
[1:10:39] on the pulpit? Hallelujah.
[1:10:42] Seven.
[1:10:47] I want to throw up sometimes
[1:10:49] what exactly does tie up with the Bible
[1:10:52] even mean? Must it say word for word? If
[1:10:55] some brother preaches and he preaches
[1:10:57] with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:59] because he said something that brother
[1:11:01] Barham does not exactly say that way,
[1:11:03] you say, "I don't believe it." Right
[1:11:05] there, you just lied. You just proved it
[1:11:07] to be true.
[1:11:09] Why are you rejecting it? Because
[1:11:11] brother Baron didn't say it exactly the
[1:11:13] same way. Inside your heart, you
[1:11:16] recognize there's something to what he's
[1:11:17] saying, but I must not believe it
[1:11:19] because I was told not to to believe
[1:11:21] anything that brother in a minute. You
[1:11:23] actually said it's true. All that
[1:11:25] nonsense you just made up in your head.
[1:11:27] You just affirmed what he said and you
[1:11:30] just don't realize it.
[1:11:33] You know, when you're speaking to a
[1:11:34] person and you're not even talking about
[1:11:36] the message, you're not even talking
[1:11:37] about God. You're telling them something
[1:11:39] and they tell you, "I can't believe
[1:11:40] that." They're telling you, "I believe
[1:11:42] that, but I don't want to accept it."
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; You understand? Think deeper.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; When someone tells you, "I can't believe
[1:11:51] that." That means I believe you, but I
[1:11:54] don't want to accept it.
[1:11:57] My work is done then. So long as you
[1:11:59] believe it, I'm good with that. So
[1:12:02] unless you're preaching, your preaching
[1:12:05] is just finding new ways to repeat the
[1:12:08] same old same old all over again, same
[1:12:11] sermons over and over, you're never
[1:12:13] going to get it right. You have to have
[1:12:16] the Holy Spirit to know the spirit of
[1:12:18] truth. There is no way from all the
[1:12:21] nonsense I just told you about what the
[1:12:24] world is. And what I'm saying to you is
[1:12:27] you don't have the individual capacity
[1:12:30] to recognize truth unless the Holy
[1:12:34] Spirit is in you.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:37] &gt;&gt; And where do you get that from? From the
[1:12:38] word for your day.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; Even having the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:45] Ghost only goes a distance.
[1:12:48] Many have the Holy Ghost, disbelieve,
[1:12:50] and fall away.
[1:12:52] Right? You have to have the spirit of
[1:12:54] truth in you to know the truth. So there
[1:12:58] has to be an inner change that takes
[1:13:00] place within you that can make you
[1:13:02] become able to identify the truth and
[1:13:05] discern both truth and lies. Now watch
[1:13:08] the scripture right we're going to read.
[1:13:10] It is the only scripture of its kind in
[1:13:13] the Bible. It tells you what your
[1:13:15] problem is and what to do to remedy it.
[1:13:18] You don't get many scriptures like that.
[1:13:20] Okay. This is Ephesians chapter 4:23.
[1:13:23] Are you still with me?
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Okay. Be prepared to be mesmerized.
[1:13:29] Paul is saying, "Be renewed in the
[1:13:32] spirit of your mind." We can take that
[1:13:34] and preach series. RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT
[1:13:36] OF YOUR MIND. HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:39] WHY?
[1:13:41] AND THAT YOU PUT ON THE NEW MAN WHICH
[1:13:43] AFTER God is created in righteousness
[1:13:45] and true holiness. Right? Now it tells
[1:13:49] you that your mind has to be renewed.
[1:13:51] Why must your mind be renewed?
[1:13:54] Obviously your mind had a problem. Okay.
[1:13:58] What is a change of mind? That's what
[1:14:00] repentance is. It also says the spirit
[1:14:03] of your mind. It doesn't be renewed in
[1:14:05] the spirit of your mind. It doesn't say
[1:14:07] be renewed in your mind's spirit. What
[1:14:10] does it mean the spirit of your mind?
[1:14:12] The nature of your mind. Same Greek word
[1:14:16] numa but in this case it's meaning
[1:14:19] nature the nature of your mind like for
[1:14:21] example if I say the spirit of your foot
[1:14:24] the spirit of your hand the spirit of
[1:14:26] your eye it's not like each member of
[1:14:29] your body has a separate spirit you're
[1:14:30] talking about the nature of it
[1:14:33] right like the spirit of your foot is to
[1:14:36] walk slightly tilted that way we're
[1:14:39] saying the nature of it is doing that
[1:14:41] are you with me
[1:14:43] &gt;&gt; the spirit of your Right? And then in
[1:14:45] this in this case it means the nature in
[1:14:49] verse 18 which you which I didn't
[1:14:51] include here. So go back home and read
[1:14:53] from verse 18. Verse 18 is telling you
[1:14:55] the condition of Gentiles was that
[1:14:58] listen their understanding is darkened
[1:15:01] being alienated from the life of God
[1:15:03] through ignorance that is in them
[1:15:05] because of the blindness of their heart.
[1:15:08] Got it? This is so true. Why are humans
[1:15:12] ignorant of God? Because they've
[1:15:14] accepted the boogeyman, the lie of the
[1:15:16] enemy, and they lived with a mind of
[1:15:19] ignorance, alienated from the truth.
[1:15:22] Now, what is amazing is HE TELLS YOU HOW
[1:15:25] TO start making a change to be renewed
[1:15:29] in the spirit of your mind. OF ALL THE
[1:15:31] THINGS TO tell you, he says, "Put away
[1:15:34] lying.
[1:15:38] Speak every man truth." He didn't say go
[1:15:40] to an altar call.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; He didn't say go scream at the altar and
[1:15:45] have the anointing come down on you. How
[1:15:48] do you be renewed in the spirit? The
[1:15:50] nature of your mind must be renewed.
[1:15:53] How?
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Put away lying.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Speak truth every man with his neighbor.
[1:15:59] For we are members. This is what I'm
[1:16:01] saying. IT'S IT'S THE ONLY SCRIPTURE OF
[1:16:03] ITS KIND THAT TELLS YOU THERE'S a
[1:16:04] problem, there's a solution.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. How do you change a human mind?
[1:16:10] Put away lying.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Incredible, isn't it?
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; You know, I've had this impression with
[1:16:21] me from the time I'm a child.
[1:16:25] And really,
[1:16:28] I could I could deal with uh people who
[1:16:30] curse at me, swear at me, fight with me,
[1:16:33] you know, uh people who are drug
[1:16:35] addicts, drunkards. I've had friends who
[1:16:38] were everything in school, growing up,
[1:16:40] some in the message. But there's only
[1:16:43] one person I cannot stand, and that's a
[1:16:45] liar. My kids know it.
[1:16:49] I can bypass anything. Do not lie to me.
[1:16:54] Do not lie to me. That's just me. And
[1:16:57] I'm going to live my best in my life,
[1:16:59] not lying to you. To always tell you the
[1:17:01] truth.
[1:17:03] This the person you cannot trust is a
[1:17:05] liar.
[1:17:07] The person you cannot um u uh trust with
[1:17:11] anything is somebody who does not deal
[1:17:13] honestly with you. The reason why you
[1:17:16] get offended with people is because they
[1:17:18] are not dealing truthfully with you.
[1:17:21] You can actually take a punch in the
[1:17:23] face. You'll heal from that. You won't
[1:17:26] heal from a lie.
[1:17:31] There is no point attempting to read the
[1:17:33] message, study the scripture, learn the
[1:17:36] mysteries, preach the mysteries, talk
[1:17:39] about the Holy Ghost, talk about the
[1:17:42] seals being opened, and still speaking
[1:17:45] lies to your brothers.
[1:17:48] What is showing is not being renewed in
[1:17:50] the spirit of your mind. the nature. So
[1:17:53] if your mind is not renewed, you are
[1:17:56] going to perceive everything from that
[1:17:59] way.
[1:18:01] You you got it.
[1:18:05] Young people, young children, I cannot
[1:18:07] tell you how important it is as a child
[1:18:11] to just tell the truth.
[1:18:14] You are make you are going to make
[1:18:16] yourself live a happy life in the
[1:18:18] future. Just tell the truth. Nothing
[1:18:21] good comes from telling lies. Everything
[1:18:23] bad comes from telling lies. Just tell
[1:18:26] the truth. You become more honest.
[1:18:28] People like you more. You get good
[1:18:31] friends.
[1:18:32] Whenever you tell the truth, you get
[1:18:34] good friends. You don't get friends who
[1:18:36] who use you
[1:18:39] who will later need you for money or
[1:18:41] need you to hop in a car to go do
[1:18:42] something bad with them. IF YOU ALWAYS
[1:18:45] TELL the truth, they'll say, "No, we
[1:18:46] don't want that guy to come with us.
[1:18:49] He'll tell on us cuz he always tell the
[1:18:51] truth.
[1:18:54] I can tell you no one none of my friends
[1:18:56] wanted me in their car when they were
[1:18:58] about to go do something. I got it many
[1:19:01] times because I there were times in
[1:19:02] school I would say okay guys I'm now
[1:19:04] going to tell the principal what WE DID
[1:19:06] LIKE A GUY. I'M SORRY I'm not I'm going
[1:19:10] to tell him otherwise you and I are
[1:19:13] going to get in trouble. We are all
[1:19:15] going to get in trouble and then this is
[1:19:16] going to go down on our testimonials.
[1:19:18] When we finished school, all these
[1:19:20] fellas came and thanked me.
[1:19:26] Don't be afraid to tell the truth. And
[1:19:29] this story about I don't snitch.
[1:19:32] I don't rat. I don't tell. Tell the
[1:19:35] truth. Don't sit with rats.
[1:19:43] You don't deserve rats for friends. Rats
[1:19:46] are not people who snitch on other
[1:19:48] people. Rats are people who live in the
[1:19:49] sewers
[1:19:51] who walk around in dumps and eat
[1:19:53] garbage.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Okay? Tell the truth, young people. You
[1:19:58] want to be baptized. You want to repent.
[1:20:00] You want to repent a renewal of your
[1:20:02] mind. Pledge to God that you will tell
[1:20:05] the truth. You will abide by the truth.
[1:20:07] You will believe the truth. I don't want
[1:20:09] to hear about you repenting from bad
[1:20:11] habits and things. YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING
[1:20:13] TO HAVE BAD HABITS EVEN after you
[1:20:15] baptized.
[1:20:17] I want to know that you are pledging to
[1:20:20] God to live truthfully with him to live
[1:20:23] honestly with him to hold yourself
[1:20:26] accountable for the things that you will
[1:20:27] do wrong to always walk in the light.
[1:20:30] That's that's why I want to be baptized.
[1:20:35] You cannot be baptized and then live a
[1:20:37] lie. You are defeating yourself.
[1:20:40] Let's go to just to show you something,
[1:20:42] right? Let's go to living righteously
[1:20:44] yet ignorant of the word.
[1:20:47] Romans 2:11, for there is no respect of
[1:20:50] persons with God. For as many as have
[1:20:52] sinned without the law shall also perish
[1:20:55] without the law. But as many as have
[1:20:57] sinned in the law shall be judged by the
[1:20:59] law. That's common sense. Now listen.
[1:21:02] For not the hearers of the law are just
[1:21:06] before God, but the doers of the law are
[1:21:09] justified.
[1:21:10] SO IT'S NO point you just hearing the
[1:21:12] message and then you're justified. No,
[1:21:14] you have to be a doer of the message,
[1:21:17] right? But watch this. For when the
[1:21:20] Gentiles Do I got to move? Yeah. When
[1:21:22] the Gentiles which don't have the law
[1:21:26] do by nature the things contained in the
[1:21:29] law that means they don't know the
[1:21:30] standards of the message but they
[1:21:32] actually live by it somehow
[1:21:35] by what is contained in the law. These
[1:21:38] who don't know the word but live by the
[1:21:40] word become a law unto themselves.
[1:21:43] I'm going to explain what that means.
[1:21:45] Which shows the work of the law written
[1:21:48] in their hearts. their conscience also
[1:21:50] bearing witness their thoughts the
[1:21:52] meanwhile accusing or else excusing one
[1:21:54] another. So let me explain this. The
[1:21:57] scripture is telling us that are you
[1:22:00] with me?
[1:22:02] People of the world can live righteously
[1:22:06] as if they are following the law of God
[1:22:09] and yet they are ignorant that the good
[1:22:12] they are doing is actually from the law
[1:22:14] of God.
[1:22:16] What am I saying?
[1:22:18] And this is one of the contentions I
[1:22:21] have with these people who teach the
[1:22:23] Holy Ghost falsely, who teach the word
[1:22:26] falsely, right? Only it's like only
[1:22:30] message people
[1:22:33] uh who do wrong things, they cannot
[1:22:36] solve their problems without the Holy
[1:22:38] Ghost anointing falling on them.
[1:22:42] There's no other way. BUT THE BUDDHIST
[1:22:45] monk who doesn't have the Holy Ghost,
[1:22:47] does not drink, smoke, fornicate. How
[1:22:49] does he do it without the Holy Ghost?
[1:22:51] What's your problem?
[1:22:55] Why must the Holy Ghost be used as a
[1:22:57] wand, a magic wand for you? Why can't
[1:23:01] you live circumspectly?
[1:23:04] There are people out there of other
[1:23:06] religions who won't drink, won't smoke,
[1:23:08] won't do drugs, won't fornicate, won't
[1:23:10] commit adultery. They do what is in the
[1:23:13] law without knowing the law. And
[1:23:16] according to God, THEY ARE JUSTIFIED BY
[1:23:19] THEIR doing even though they don't know
[1:23:22] it.
[1:23:26] And what it says in verse 15 there is
[1:23:28] actually saying because they keep the
[1:23:30] law without even knowing the law, THEY
[1:23:32] ARE JUSTIFIED BY IT. THEY ACTUALLY
[1:23:35] become a judge.
[1:23:37] They become a law UNTO THEMSELVES
[1:23:39] BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING. They
[1:23:41] are being good moral people. They can
[1:23:44] literally within themselves judge other
[1:23:47] people for not living the same way they
[1:23:49] do.
[1:23:51] They also judge and they excuse one
[1:23:54] another. Which means they can grant
[1:23:56] mercy and judgment because they are
[1:23:58] living a law which they don't even know.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; But you who hear the law and don't do
[1:24:04] it.
[1:24:06] And you want a MAGIC WARN ANOINTING.
[1:24:09] HOLY GHOST, take it away from me, Lord.
[1:24:12] But I still want to do it.
[1:24:17] You see, this is the problem.
[1:24:20] So, what are we saying? People can live
[1:24:22] righteously and yet ignorant of the
[1:24:25] truth.
[1:24:27] You agree?
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Verse 13 is the frightening part which
[1:24:31] tells you that people are not justified
[1:24:33] from sin just because you heard the
[1:24:35] word. people are justified by doing the
[1:24:39] word. Right? So it means that God
[1:24:42] acknowledges when any believer or
[1:24:45] non-believer lives righteously. A
[1:24:48] non-believer of the message, a
[1:24:49] non-Christian who lives a good righteous
[1:24:53] life will find mercy with God at the
[1:24:56] white throne judgment and receive
[1:24:58] eternal life. That's the Bible.
[1:25:03] This is the thing most religions and
[1:25:05] people all over the world don't know
[1:25:06] about what Christianity actually is. For
[1:25:09] God so loved the world, he came to
[1:25:12] his only son, gave his only son uh for
[1:25:15] the remission of sins, right? And and
[1:25:17] and people will find mercy in the world
[1:25:21] by simply even living the law of Christ
[1:25:24] without even knowing it.
[1:25:27] They can learn it from us. They can
[1:25:28] learn it from you. They can patent
[1:25:30] themselves off to you. They can just be
[1:25:32] people who live morally and righteously
[1:25:34] and they will find grace
[1:25:39] when people live righteously.
[1:25:41] But there is a catch. There is a
[1:25:43] problem. It's coming up.
[1:25:46] Right? The point I'm trying to make is
[1:25:48] that living righteously is not proof
[1:25:50] that you have truth.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; you got it.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Okay. uh you or it's not even proof that
[1:25:57] you know the spirit of truth because you
[1:25:59] literally see good people out there
[1:26:02] living moral righteous lives doing good.
[1:26:05] They give more to the poor than you do.
[1:26:10] They give charities more than you do.
[1:26:13] They form more societies to help uh what
[1:26:17] do you call these things? Programs to
[1:26:19] help societies more than you do. God
[1:26:22] will bless them for that. They feed the
[1:26:25] poor. They take care of the widows. They
[1:26:26] take care of the orphans. God will bless
[1:26:29] that and reward them for it.
[1:26:34] But when people live righteously by
[1:26:36] their own will, here's the problem
[1:26:38] because this is where it leads to. When
[1:26:41] you live righteously by your own will,
[1:26:44] you eventually feel justified in judging
[1:26:47] others. It's human nature. If I can do
[1:26:50] it, why can't you? Therefore, I am good.
[1:26:54] you are bad. With Christ, we don't do
[1:26:56] that.
[1:26:59] When we have the truth, we we're like,
[1:27:02] we are all sinners saved by grace. I
[1:27:05] cannot judge you. It is he that judges.
[1:27:08] When you hear the word, believe the
[1:27:09] word, you don't judge like they do.
[1:27:14] People who believe the truth, and even
[1:27:16] have the spirit of truth living in them
[1:27:18] have a far greater struggle to live
[1:27:20] righteously. Do you know that?
[1:27:23] So what did Romans 7 tell us? Romans 7,
[1:27:27] go read the whole thing. Before I knew
[1:27:29] the law, I was free. BUT WHEN I HEARD
[1:27:32] THE WORD, I I became a prisoner.
[1:27:35] That's when all my trouble started.
[1:27:38] Okay? So it is saints. People, this is
[1:27:42] what I want to tell you. Because you're
[1:27:45] in the message, you are going to have a
[1:27:47] harder time than people out there.
[1:27:50] Because people out there don't know.
[1:27:52] They don't care that they're doing wrong
[1:27:54] because you know the word has the the
[1:27:56] revelation of this day has highlighted
[1:27:59] to you what is wrong. You have a
[1:28:01] responsibility to it. You are going to
[1:28:03] have a harder time living it. Are you
[1:28:05] with me? So let's prove that people who
[1:28:09] believe the truth even have the spirit
[1:28:11] of truth in them have a harder time. And
[1:28:14] it's quite a paradox. It is the paradox
[1:28:17] that many message preachers and people
[1:28:20] fail to understand.
[1:28:22] Everyone in the message has this group
[1:28:24] think that if you believe the message,
[1:28:27] you are supposed to live a perfect life
[1:28:30] without any struggle and you are not
[1:28:32] even supposed to have an inward
[1:28:33] struggle.
[1:28:35] False.
[1:28:38] They're controlling you.
[1:28:40] Everything brother tells us is when you
[1:28:42] receive the Holy Ghost, that's when your
[1:28:44] struggle starts.
[1:28:46] Okay, so that's where we get to with the
[1:28:50] white dog and the black dog. Okay, are
[1:28:54] you still with us? All right, let's go
[1:28:56] to this quote. Now, before we read the
[1:28:59] quote, I'm going to explain something to
[1:29:00] you. There's a story the prophet was
[1:29:02] telling us in this message actually in
[1:29:05] question and answers part four. And to
[1:29:07] let you know, this story came about
[1:29:10] because of a question about Romans 7.
[1:29:13] Okay. So what happened was brother Billy
[1:29:16] Paul was in charge of the prayer cards.
[1:29:18] Uh he was in this camp meeting. They
[1:29:20] they had this tent meeting and brother
[1:29:22] Billy Paul's brother Ram told him go and
[1:29:24] give out prayer cards to those but make
[1:29:26] sure you give it to those who are really
[1:29:28] in a bad state. There must be people who
[1:29:30] are like almost dying or really in a bad
[1:29:32] make sure you give them preference. And
[1:29:34] he goes around walking and and brother
[1:29:36] Billy Paul sees this this native red
[1:29:39] Indian man sitting there got a cap on
[1:29:42] and a feather in his cap. and he's
[1:29:43] sitting on the floor in the tent and
[1:29:45] he's and uh brother Billy walks by him
[1:29:48] and he's he's looking for people and
[1:29:49] this man is just standing he's just
[1:29:50] sitting there and and and looking and
[1:29:53] then brother brother Billy comes to him
[1:29:55] and says to him hey chief how you doing
[1:29:58] he says I'm sick
[1:30:01] and he says yeah but what's wrong with
[1:30:03] you I'm sick
[1:30:05] very sick and he said okay but what is
[1:30:09] the problem do you have some disease I'm
[1:30:12] sick
[1:30:13] And he says, "Uh, but I really like to
[1:30:15] know what the problem is, you know,
[1:30:17] because he's worrying now. What do I do?
[1:30:19] Do I give him a card? I am sick. Very,
[1:30:21] very sick." Okay. He walks on, he gives
[1:30:25] out more cards and whatever. And he
[1:30:26] comes back speak to the chief. Same
[1:30:29] thing. I'm sick. So that's where he gets
[1:30:32] to. And then he said, "Somebody told me
[1:30:34] he had done one time was converted,
[1:30:36] received the Holy Ghost." And he said to
[1:30:37] him, "Uh, how you getting along?" So he
[1:30:41] said pretty good and pretty bad. So
[1:30:44] here's this Indian chief talking now to
[1:30:46] brother Billy Paul. How you getting
[1:30:48] along? Like in other words, brother
[1:30:49] Billy Paul heard this Indian chief had
[1:30:51] come to the the word, come to the
[1:30:53] meetings. He became a Christian. He
[1:30:55] converted. He received the Holy Ghost.
[1:30:56] But now he come back and he's sick.
[1:30:59] And then he said to him, "So how you
[1:31:01] getting along?" In other words, how you
[1:31:02] doing since you became a Christian? It's
[1:31:04] pretty good and pretty bad. He said,
[1:31:08] "Well, how do you mean pretty good and
[1:31:10] pretty bad?" Now, here it is. Well,
[1:31:14] since me received the Holy Ghost, he
[1:31:16] said, "There's been two dogs in me. One
[1:31:20] that one of them a black dog, one of
[1:31:22] them a white dog
[1:31:26] since I received the Holy Ghost."
[1:31:31] and said, "They argue all the time.
[1:31:37] They growl and fight at one another and
[1:31:40] said, "The white dog wants me to do
[1:31:42] good. The black dog wants me to do bad."
[1:31:45] He's just speaking Romans 7 in another
[1:31:47] way.
[1:31:49] Right? And said, "Well, chief, which one
[1:31:53] of them wins?" The chief says, "That
[1:31:56] depends on which one chief feeds the
[1:31:59] most.
[1:32:01] So I think that's a good answer. Brother
[1:32:03] Barham said that just depends on the
[1:32:06] waring of the body of the body INSIDE
[1:32:08] YOU. IT DEPENDS on which one you cater
[1:32:11] to. Which nature you cater to? The
[1:32:16] carnal nature after things of the world
[1:32:18] or the spiritual nature after the things
[1:32:20] of God. Saints, this is the story of the
[1:32:23] black dog and the white dog.
[1:32:26] So when the chief was asked, "How are
[1:32:28] you doing? I'm sick. Very, very sick. He
[1:32:31] actually had no human disease. He was
[1:32:34] talking about a spiritual mind sickness.
[1:32:38] This was bothering him that I received
[1:32:40] the Holy Ghost and yet now I'm having
[1:32:42] the biggest struggle inside me. Turmoil,
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; TWO DOGS FIGHTING. WHICH ONE WINS? The
[1:32:49] one I feed the most. That's the greatest
[1:32:51] honesty you could ever have.
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; Isn't that incredible?
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. For those people who are preaching
[1:32:58] the Holy Ghost is the remedy or the
[1:33:00] solution for all your problems. Here is
[1:33:02] it in the message that when you get the
[1:33:04] Holy Ghost the two dogs start fighting.
[1:33:08] You all know that in Cood he implies
[1:33:11] that if you you remember the other quote
[1:33:14] in COD if you thought you were in a
[1:33:16] battle wait till you get the Holy Ghost
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; because when you get the Holy Ghost you
[1:33:22] become the target of the enemy. This is
[1:33:25] a quote. Every gun is trained on you.
[1:33:31] Right? So, the prophet was astounded at
[1:33:34] the chief's description of the inward
[1:33:37] struggle of a believer. He described it
[1:33:39] as two dogs fighting. I like that
[1:33:41] they're arguing all the time. Sunday
[1:33:44] school, you remember what I told you?
[1:33:46] The two voices. When you want to do
[1:33:49] something, something tells you you know
[1:33:52] what's the right thing to do. And
[1:33:53] there's another voice says, "But you can
[1:33:56] do it. Come on. It's going to be fun."
[1:34:00] H you going to listen to? But you know,
[1:34:03] if I do the right thing, mommy's
[1:34:06] probably going to give me a present, a
[1:34:08] treat, something. But somehow mommy's
[1:34:11] treat is not as good as the fun,
[1:34:15] right? But the fun's going to get you in
[1:34:17] trouble. It's going to make people
[1:34:19] think, "Oh, this is the kind of person
[1:34:21] you are. This is the kind of what must
[1:34:25] be the kind of parents you have.
[1:34:28] What must be the kind of church you come
[1:34:30] from? It doesn't just stop with you when
[1:34:33] you listen to that other voice. And this
[1:34:36] is not only for children. Clearly here
[1:34:38] you have a man who came and was
[1:34:40] converted and received the Holy Ghost
[1:34:43] and confessing there are two dogs
[1:34:45] fighting inside.
[1:34:48] I love that. I love it when when people
[1:34:51] in the message come to me and say,
[1:34:52] "Brother L, I'm having such a hard time.
[1:34:54] I know what I'm supposed to do. I'm
[1:34:56] having a problem with this." And I love
[1:34:58] that. To me, that's like, "Let's work it
[1:35:00] out, brother. You know, this is how you
[1:35:02] can actually deal with people."
[1:35:05] The prophet himself really applauded
[1:35:07] that answer. He said, "Well, that's a
[1:35:09] good answer here." Are you still with
[1:35:12] me? So I want to get to the part the
[1:35:14] prophet says catering to. Okay, catering
[1:35:20] today is not feeding people biryani.
[1:35:24] Okay, catering in English implies to
[1:35:28] serving,
[1:35:30] entertaining, sustaining and basically
[1:35:33] keeping something alive.
[1:35:37] Okay, keeping something satisfied. To
[1:35:40] cater to something means to keep it
[1:35:43] satisfied.
[1:35:45] All right? To cater to an addiction
[1:35:47] means to keep it satisfied. To cater to
[1:35:50] a person means to keep them satisfied.
[1:35:52] Catering to your boss, catering to
[1:35:55] somebody in your life, it's keeping them
[1:35:57] satisfied. You're going over the top to
[1:35:59] do something to keep them satisfied, to
[1:36:02] keep them engaged. Okay?
[1:36:05] Because living under lies feels safer,
[1:36:11] right? This is a problem for human
[1:36:13] beings. The question is why would a
[1:36:17] person in the message cater to
[1:36:20] nickelotinism or organized religion? Why
[1:36:23] would a person who's received the
[1:36:26] message of the hour through the prophet
[1:36:28] go right back to a church where you are
[1:36:31] living by organized religion and
[1:36:32] controlled by another human being? Why
[1:36:34] would you DO THAT? WHY WOULD YOU ACCEPT
[1:36:36] NICKELONISM? WHY WOULD YOU INSIST on
[1:36:39] living under lies instead of being free
[1:36:42] under the truth? Because living under
[1:36:46] lies is safer.
[1:36:50] Living under lies is safer because the
[1:36:53] accountability is taken away from you
[1:36:55] and placed with somebody else.
[1:36:57] You don't have to be held accountable
[1:37:00] because it's safer to let someone else
[1:37:03] be held accountable.
[1:37:05] That's the gospel that's being preached
[1:37:07] now in the message and in Christian
[1:37:09] churches. Don't worry, you're okay.
[1:37:11] You're safe here with us.
[1:37:14] You don't realize nickelanism
[1:37:17] is going to lead you to a very dark
[1:37:20] place where you can't come out of.
[1:37:24] I could take dozens of types in the
[1:37:27] scripture to show you
[1:37:30] from the types and shadows of Abraham to
[1:37:32] Moses to Joshua to David and on and on.
[1:37:35] You will see that all true believers had
[1:37:38] to go beyond what looked safe to achieve
[1:37:42] the purpose of God.
[1:37:45] They had to go beyond reasoning. They
[1:37:47] had to even go beyond the preaching and
[1:37:49] teaching of their day
[1:37:52] TO GO BEYOND. THEY HAD TO ACTUALLY
[1:37:54] BELIEVE IN something that was not
[1:37:56] revealed to the other ministries.
[1:37:59] Do you get what I'm saying? What is the
[1:38:01] prophet telling us to to today? When we
[1:38:04] hear the prophet's message and he brings
[1:38:06] to us the seven seals, it's beyond what
[1:38:08] Pentecost taught. It's beyond what the
[1:38:10] what the Bible showed. It's beyond what
[1:38:13] I Martin and everyone else showed. The
[1:38:15] revelation of the seven seals went
[1:38:17] beyond all of that. For us to overcome
[1:38:19] in this day, we've got to believe
[1:38:21] something that goes beyond what the
[1:38:24] public or the crowd is taking
[1:38:28] and it's not safe. Why do people reject
[1:38:31] the opening of the seventh seal? Cuz
[1:38:32] they don't feel safe.
[1:38:35] That's the that's the prime REASON
[1:38:36] BECAUSE IF I believe in the opening of
[1:38:38] the seventh seal, I might miss his
[1:38:40] coming. So it's rather uh rather not
[1:38:45] miss his coming rather stay safe with
[1:38:47] what everyone is believing cuz it's it
[1:38:50] feels safer there. What if we believe
[1:38:53] this and we're wrong and we miss his
[1:38:54] coming? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO MISS HIS
[1:38:56] COMING BY BELIEVING in the opening of
[1:38:57] the SEVENTH SEAL? YOU'RE ACTUALLY
[1:38:59] believing in his coming in a different
[1:39:02] way to other people.
[1:39:05] You're still living the right life.
[1:39:06] You're still believing God. You're still
[1:39:07] worshiping God. If Christ comes whatever
[1:39:10] way HE CHOOSES, YOU'RE STILL GOING TO BE
[1:39:12] THERE.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; NO,
[1:39:17] let's be safe. So, it requires believing
[1:39:20] the truth for your day. Moses, Joshua,
[1:39:24] David, all of them, for them to achieve
[1:39:28] the purpose of God in their day, they
[1:39:29] had to believe the word for their day.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with us? Okay, let's draw down
[1:39:35] to a close the spirit of lies in the
[1:39:39] message.
[1:39:42] Not a subject you really want to talk
[1:39:44] about.
[1:39:46] You have to know that the greatest lies
[1:39:50] have always been in the very presence of
[1:39:52] God's people.
[1:39:55] Agreed? Where there was a Moses, there
[1:39:57] was a Janice and Jambas. There was a
[1:39:59] Kora, David, and Abram. Where there was
[1:40:01] a Micaiah, there was a Zedekiah and 400
[1:40:03] prophets. Where there was a Jesus, there
[1:40:05] was a Judas sitting right next to him.
[1:40:09] Right? Where there WAS A JACOB, THERE
[1:40:10] WAS AN ESAU.
[1:40:13] Where the spirit of God is, where the
[1:40:15] spirit of truth is, the spirit of lies
[1:40:17] is following right behind it.
[1:40:20] Why? Why is it? Think about it. Uh
[1:40:25] nobody can bring to you the lies. Okay,
[1:40:29] everyone awake. What is a lie?
[1:40:33] Those of you read the message, it is the
[1:40:36] truth misrepresented.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Right. So, you're never going to get a
[1:40:42] new lie unless there's a new truth
[1:40:44] revealed.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; So, nobody is going to come and preach
[1:40:49] to you the lie that was created after
[1:40:51] Martin Luther preached his message.
[1:40:55] So when Martin Luther came, the spirit
[1:40:57] of lies followed it.
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; When Wesley came, the spirit of lies
[1:41:02] followed that. It took the truth that
[1:41:04] Wesley preached and created a lie from
[1:41:06] it.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; So what do you think is going to HAPPEN
[1:41:08] HERE WITH THE MESSAGE?
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; The truth is going to come in revealed
[1:41:12] by the prophet and the spirit of lie
[1:41:13] will follow behind it.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; So there are so many lies spoken in the
[1:41:20] prophet's name today. Some are blatant
[1:41:23] intentional falsehoods
[1:41:26] and everyone can see that. But those who
[1:41:29] believe in blatant intentional lies are
[1:41:32] people who have been hurt in their lives
[1:41:35] and because they can't get over the hurt
[1:41:37] they are accepting these things and they
[1:41:39] are damaged people. Among them are lies
[1:41:43] that elevate the prophet to be worshiped
[1:41:46] as God.
[1:41:48] Can you believe behind brother Brandham
[1:41:50] there are people who make brother
[1:41:51] Brandham God and pray to him
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; and worship him
[1:41:56] and it's so close and false because he
[1:41:59] was a son of man ministry but we don't
[1:42:02] go and pray in William Brandham's name
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; h how could we do that to this man take
[1:42:08] and he even warned you not to do that
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; and there are people in this in they
[1:42:12] claim to be in this message taking his
[1:42:15] name and making him physically God,
[1:42:19] that is a lie. You are even speaking
[1:42:21] something he told you not to do,
[1:42:27] right? But you're not going to be taken
[1:42:30] by that lie. You know that lie.
[1:42:34] There are people in the message
[1:42:38] um among those elevating the prophet,
[1:42:40] those lies are rejected by most of
[1:42:42] message people.
[1:42:44] But here's the problem. The even more
[1:42:48] dangerous
[1:42:50] uh uh often very subtle lies
[1:42:54] are carefully disguised and appear to be
[1:42:57] almost on the level and they have people
[1:43:00] mesmerized and hooked into a nickelan
[1:43:02] system or an organized religion while
[1:43:06] thinking they are preaching against it.
[1:43:10] Don't miss that.
[1:43:12] The majority of people who are falling
[1:43:15] to ecumenical nickelan lies are
[1:43:19] literally trapped by these lies while
[1:43:23] listening to preachers who are claiming
[1:43:25] to be preaching against nickelanism.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Got it? So the majority of lies that
[1:43:33] fools most of the people are those lies
[1:43:37] that presents the message as a set of
[1:43:39] restrictive rules.
[1:43:44] Listen, let's let's pull the covers off.
[1:43:48] Are you with me?
[1:43:50] I can come here all day and preach the
[1:43:53] revelation of the seven seals, the
[1:43:54] thunders, all the mysteries.
[1:43:58] You will lose all your spirituality
[1:44:02] if you see a sister in the church not
[1:44:05] dressed right.
[1:44:11] All your faith in the mystery is gone.
[1:44:14] You suddenly become that heathen again
[1:44:16] who cares about safety.
[1:44:20] You will lose all your spirituality if a
[1:44:22] brother does something against cood.
[1:44:26] We can be preaching the seals, the
[1:44:27] thunders, the mysteries and all that. If
[1:44:30] the song leader takes 45 minutes, you
[1:44:32] become heathen again.
[1:44:36] If a brother prays too long, you lose
[1:44:38] all your spirituality.
[1:44:41] If a brother comes here to testify and
[1:44:43] it takes 20 minutes, you are sitting
[1:44:45] there getting so stressed,
[1:44:48] literally a devil rising within you
[1:44:53] till you getting anxious and like he's
[1:44:56] really taking long. We didn't come here
[1:44:57] to listen to this. We came to listen to
[1:44:59] the word. I've been through this. I know
[1:45:01] what I'm talking about. I've met these
[1:45:03] people.
[1:45:04] And yet they claim to believe all the
[1:45:06] mysteries and have the seven thunders,
[1:45:08] brother. have the seven thunder power
[1:45:11] and you can't have patience with another
[1:45:13] saint, another believer. You cannot just
[1:45:18] relax, go with the flow. No, you lose
[1:45:22] your marbles, spill it all OVER THE
[1:45:24] PLACE, COME OUTSIDE. You know what? I'm
[1:45:26] I'm making an appointment with a pastor
[1:45:28] this week. We're going to talk about
[1:45:30] this this lack of cood. This messing up,
[1:45:33] this is taking TOO HE GIVES TOO MUCH
[1:45:36] LEEWAY to these people. I'm going to
[1:45:38] sort this out. And if he doesn't listen,
[1:45:39] I'm going to the deacon. I'm sitting
[1:45:41] there looking at this and thinking,
[1:45:43] "Booy man, got you."
[1:45:48] BECAUSE OF ALL YOUR STUFF IN THE
[1:45:50] MESSAGE, YOU STILL COME BACK down to the
[1:45:52] rule keeper.
[1:45:55] That's who you really are, the rule
[1:45:57] keeper. NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE ENJOY THE
[1:46:00] PREACHING and the mysteries and the
[1:46:02] wonderful mystery truths revealed, YOU
[1:46:04] ARE STILL AT CORE the person who feels
[1:46:07] the message is restrictive rules and
[1:46:09] laws meant to keep us safe. And if we
[1:46:11] don't keep that in line, we're not going
[1:46:14] to be safe.
[1:46:17] You know what happens? We've reached a
[1:46:19] time, saints, when those lies are about
[1:46:21] to be tested and exposed.
[1:46:24] all the rules and laws you are keeping.
[1:46:26] I believe God let us go five decades of
[1:46:30] the message to prove to you that all of
[1:46:32] you rule keepers lose your children,
[1:46:36] your wife, your husband, your cousins,
[1:46:39] your family members who are all rule
[1:46:41] keepers with you. And then by the same
[1:46:44] rules, you judged other people. You lost
[1:46:47] those people. You you derided people.
[1:46:50] You hurt other people's children. And
[1:46:53] then after five decades of keeping
[1:46:55] rules, you can't keep the the rules the
[1:46:57] same way all the time. You then
[1:47:00] adjusting where conveniences you
[1:47:02] conveniences your family and YOU BUT YOU
[1:47:05] STILL WANT TO keep those rules according
[1:47:08] to how it's convenient to you. Remain a
[1:47:10] rulekeeper. Stand with your pride intact
[1:47:13] and say one thing. I'M A MAN WHO DOESN'T
[1:47:15] COMPROMISE.
[1:47:19] BOOGEYMAN. GOTCHA.
[1:47:23] Your world is about to come crashing
[1:47:24] down. I'm telling you right now in 2026,
[1:47:27] all you rulekeepers, all you legalists,
[1:47:31] all you people promoting boogeymans, you
[1:47:34] are about to see your world come
[1:47:35] crashing down. You that persecute other
[1:47:38] people and don't do the same thing in
[1:47:40] your own home, you that apply rules and
[1:47:44] burdens upon other people and don't keep
[1:47:46] it in your in your own home, you are
[1:47:48] about to see your world come crashing
[1:47:49] down. It is ripe out there.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; You cannot control cell phones. You
[1:47:56] cannot control social media. You cannot
[1:47:58] control the internet. You don't even
[1:47:59] have good enough rules to control that
[1:48:01] beast. You are about to see it poison
[1:48:04] humanity, your children, your spouses,
[1:48:07] your families, your your quality of life
[1:48:10] is going to be you are about to see it
[1:48:12] affect your skeletal system, your your
[1:48:15] vascular system. You are about to see
[1:48:17] destroy public completely. It is going
[1:48:20] to come crashing down on you.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Nowhere is safe anymore. And God has let
[1:48:25] this happen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; Your world is coming down. So what do
[1:48:31] you think, young people? Do you think
[1:48:33] the prophet was sent to teach us these
[1:48:36] things the way he did because he wanted
[1:48:38] us to follow rules?
[1:48:40] Do you think the prophet came and gave
[1:48:42] us the message because God wanted us
[1:48:44] following human leadership?
[1:48:46] I'll tell you right now, brother
[1:48:48] Alistister is not your savior and not
[1:48:51] going to take you to heaven.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; And I will never take that position away
[1:48:55] from our savior. He is the one who saves
[1:48:58] us. He is the one who is the one we
[1:49:00] worship. He is the one with the final
[1:49:02] authority on all the word.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; I am not. Do not look to me because I
[1:49:09] may even let you down someday.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; What do you think? Do you seriously
[1:49:15] think that the message that we live in
[1:49:17] this church is rules?
[1:49:21] Did you really think that God pulled you
[1:49:23] out of denominations and religions of
[1:49:25] the world, you older people, and
[1:49:27] ignorance from other things to bring you
[1:49:29] to a message only to subject YOU TO A
[1:49:32] NEW ORGANIZED RELIGION,
[1:49:34] new cood, new nickelotinism? And and
[1:49:37] just so so those of you who keep the
[1:49:40] rules THE BEST WILL FLY off to heaven
[1:49:42] someday. and those who couldn't keep it
[1:49:44] the best will be dumped in hell someday.
[1:49:47] Is that what God brought to us?
[1:49:50] Take some time off and consider this in
[1:49:52] your devotions. Is this really what the
[1:49:56] Spirit of Truth brought for us today? Is
[1:49:58] this what makes us the bride? No. I want
[1:50:02] you to consider these few scriptures.
[1:50:05] Is the message rules or wisdom? Are you
[1:50:07] with us? We're closing.
[1:50:10] Isaiah 59:4, "None calleth for justice,
[1:50:14] nor any pleath for truth. They trust in
[1:50:17] vanity and speak lies. They conceive
[1:50:20] mischief and bring forth iniquity."
[1:50:23] This is just telling you the nature. I
[1:50:26] don't have time to go through
[1:50:27] everything, but what these scriptures
[1:50:29] are going to show you is it is
[1:50:32] first nature for man to tend to lies.
[1:50:36] There is none that calls for justice. I
[1:50:40] can prove this to you. You who are
[1:50:42] sitting right here now in the message
[1:50:44] with the open book, I will prove to you
[1:50:47] that you will CALL FOR JUSTICE WITH
[1:50:49] OTHER PEOPLE, but when it comes to your
[1:50:50] own children, you'll plead mercy.
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 59:12-13.
[1:50:58] For our transgressions are multiplied
[1:51:00] before thee, and our sins testify
[1:51:01] against us. For our transgressions are
[1:51:04] with us, and as our iniquities we know
[1:51:06] them. In transgressing and lying against
[1:51:10] the Lord, and departing away from our
[1:51:12] God, speaking oppression and revolt,
[1:51:15] conceiving and uttering from the heart
[1:51:17] words of falsehood.
[1:51:20] Jeremiah 9:5. They will deceive
[1:51:22] everyone, his neighbor, and will not
[1:51:25] speak the truth. They have taught their
[1:51:27] tongue to speak lies and wear themselves
[1:51:31] to commit iniquity.
[1:51:33] 2 Corinthians 4:2. But have renounced
[1:51:36] the hidden things of dishonesty, not
[1:51:38] walking in craftiness, not handling the
[1:51:40] word of God deceitfully, but by
[1:51:42] manifestation of the truth, commending
[1:51:43] ourselves to every man's conscience in
[1:51:45] the sight of God. Romans 1:24:25. Go
[1:51:48] back home and go through these
[1:51:49] scriptures. Wherefore God also gave them
[1:51:52] up to uncleanness through the lust of
[1:51:54] their own hearts, to dishonor their own
[1:51:56] bodies between themselves, who changed
[1:51:58] the truth of God into a lie, and worship
[1:52:02] and serve the creature more than the
[1:52:03] creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. 1
[1:52:06] Timothy 4:1-2.
[1:52:08] Now the spirit speaketh expressly that
[1:52:10] in the latter times some shall depart
[1:52:12] from the faith, giving heed to seducing
[1:52:14] spirits and doctrines of devils,
[1:52:17] speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their
[1:52:20] conscience seared with a hot iron. Okay,
[1:52:23] I could spend a lot of time explaining,
[1:52:25] but I'm not. I want you to go home and
[1:52:27] and look at it. These scriptures tell us
[1:52:30] that our sin is not our wrongdoings that
[1:52:34] we did.
[1:52:36] You can easily give up smoking,
[1:52:39] drinking, you can do it. You can give up
[1:52:41] fornication today. You can give up
[1:52:44] adultery at any moment. You can give up
[1:52:47] anything
[1:52:49] any moment. It's not the problem.
[1:52:52] The problem is lies.
[1:52:55] It always has been lies.
[1:52:59] We just proved to you earlier that
[1:53:01] people in the world can live righteously
[1:53:03] without knowing the word. Which means
[1:53:06] anything that you have a problem with,
[1:53:08] you can give up.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; YES,
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN GIVE IT UP without the word.
[1:53:14] You just have to have a strong will.
[1:53:17] That's how people in the world do it.
[1:53:18] They strengthen their will. It's like
[1:53:20] when you're dealing with somebody who is
[1:53:22] an addict, like a like a guy who's um
[1:53:24] who's hooped on cigarettes and uh you're
[1:53:28] on the phone with him and maybe you're
[1:53:29] his sponsor. This is how you do it in
[1:53:30] psychology. And the guy phones you at
[1:53:32] 12:00 at night. He said, "I'm I'm really
[1:53:34] stressed. I feel like smoking." Said,
[1:53:35] "Okay, let's call him John." "Okay,
[1:53:38] John, where's the cigarette? It's in my
[1:53:40] hands right now. What do you want to
[1:53:42] do?" You don't tell him, "John, I want
[1:53:44] you to go to the bin and throw it in
[1:53:46] there right now." No. At every moment
[1:53:49] you have to ask him a question and he
[1:53:51] has to make a decision. John, what do
[1:53:53] you want to do? Do you want to put the
[1:53:55] cigarette in your lips right now or do
[1:53:56] you want to you want to go to the bin?
[1:53:58] You give him small questions with small
[1:54:00] decisions. This how I'm telling you how
[1:54:02] you deal with psychology. You can
[1:54:03] actually deal with your children this
[1:54:05] way. How do you what do you want to do?
[1:54:08] Do you want to put the cigarette in your
[1:54:10] mouth or do you want to take one step
[1:54:12] towards the bin? And John thinks I want
[1:54:15] to put it in your mouth. Okay, John,
[1:54:17] what's your choice? You still don't tell
[1:54:19] him. Put it in your mouth. What's your
[1:54:21] choice? Do you really want to do this?
[1:54:23] You give him another question. At every
[1:54:25] point, he has to make a decision. He
[1:54:27] says, "Okay, I want to take a step to
[1:54:29] the bin." Takes to to the bin. Okay,
[1:54:33] John, you took one step. How about five?
[1:54:35] Would you like to take five? Okay, I'll
[1:54:37] take five. John, how far is the bin from
[1:54:39] you? It's in the kitchen. Uh, John,
[1:54:41] would you like to go to the kitchen? Not
[1:54:43] really. Um, how do you would you like to
[1:54:45] sit down on the couch and think about it
[1:54:47] for a moment? This is agony for a
[1:54:49] sponsor, right? But eventually, you ask
[1:54:51] the right questions, you strengthen his
[1:54:54] self-will, you get him to make his own
[1:54:56] decisions, get him right to the bin,
[1:54:58] open the lid with the pedal, and tell
[1:55:00] him, "John, would you like to break the
[1:55:01] cigarette?" At every point, the sponsor
[1:55:04] is increasing his self-will, the
[1:55:07] strength OF HIS SELF-WILL. YOU CAN DO
[1:55:09] ALL THAT without the word.
[1:55:12] People do it.
[1:55:18] They can learn to give up their
[1:55:20] addictions by strengthening selfworth.
[1:55:22] For us who come to the truth, we do not
[1:55:25] take joy in that we have overcome
[1:55:27] unrighteousness. We take joy in that we
[1:55:30] overcome the lie THAT PRODUCED THE
[1:55:33] UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. AMEN.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; SEE, we can easily give up wrongdoings,
[1:55:38] but what we find hard to give up is
[1:55:40] living by lies and telling lies. The
[1:55:43] entire all the scriptures I read to you
[1:55:45] told you this is human nature. That's
[1:55:48] where our problem lies. This is what we
[1:55:51] need salvation from. You're this is why
[1:55:54] I tell you some of the young men and
[1:55:56] women today, young people at camps who
[1:55:58] have a problem with pornography and
[1:56:00] problem with stuff in the world. They
[1:56:02] want they want to focus on the problem.
[1:56:04] FOCUS ON THE PROBLEM. THAT'S NOT EVEN
[1:56:06] THE PROBLEM. The problem is up here.
[1:56:10] That thing is always going to be there.
[1:56:12] Other people find ways without the word
[1:56:15] to overcome that thing. Your problem is
[1:56:17] up here. It's in the mind.
[1:56:20] What is lying to you?
[1:56:24] See, what we find hard to give up is
[1:56:27] living by lies. We need salvation from
[1:56:29] the spirit of lies. So I want to bring
[1:56:31] you to this point. How are the two dogs
[1:56:34] fed? That's the question we have to ask
[1:56:37] ourselves when you look at this analogy
[1:56:38] of the white dog and the black dog
[1:56:40] fighting and there are two different
[1:56:41] natures fighting inside you. I and I've
[1:56:44] explained this to you in Romans 7,
[1:56:45] right? Where Paul says when I want to do
[1:56:47] good, evil is present. There's the two
[1:56:49] dogs. And I want to do what is right,
[1:56:51] but I eventually find myself doing the
[1:56:52] wrong thing. And so I'm not I'm not
[1:56:55] making this up. prophet actually uh used
[1:56:58] the the story of the the the two dogs in
[1:57:01] answering the question on Romans 7. But
[1:57:04] I want to draw your attention to this
[1:57:05] subject that these are spiritual dogs,
[1:57:10] right?
[1:57:11] So how do you feed a spiritual dog?
[1:57:16] What are you feeding them? He said
[1:57:18] you're catering to them. How are you
[1:57:20] catering to the dog that's wanting to
[1:57:23] wanting you to do bad? How are you
[1:57:25] catering to it? How are you feeding it?
[1:57:27] How are you keeping it alive? How are
[1:57:30] you keeping the other dog alive that
[1:57:31] wants you to do good? How are you
[1:57:33] feeding it? What do you feed it? So
[1:57:35] people say, "Well, you feed it
[1:57:37] worldliness." No, the black dog is not
[1:57:40] fed worldliness.
[1:57:42] It's a spirit. You don't feed a spirit
[1:57:45] worldliness.
[1:57:47] You're feeding the flesh worldliness.
[1:57:50] What is What is it that the two dogs
[1:57:53] eat?
[1:57:56] Okay, I'm going to explain this. The
[1:57:58] dogs are not fed by wrongdoing.
[1:58:01] The bad dog is not fed by worldly music.
[1:58:04] It's not fed addiction. It's not fed bad
[1:58:06] friends. It's not fed worldliness. The
[1:58:09] bad DOG IS THE DESIRE FOR THAT.
[1:58:13] Are you with me? It is the nature that
[1:58:17] leans towards those things. THE BAD DOG
[1:58:20] MAKES YOU DO THAT AFTER YOU FED IT with
[1:58:23] something.
[1:58:26] The good dog,
[1:58:28] hey you good dogs,
[1:58:30] good dog is not going to church. You
[1:58:33] don't feed the good dog by going to
[1:58:35] church or reading the word or praying or
[1:58:37] good religion. The good dog IS THE
[1:58:40] DESIRE TO go to church, to read the
[1:58:42] word, to be to feed to feed the the the
[1:58:45] poor and and take care of the the the
[1:58:48] poor and the needy. Um it's the nature
[1:58:51] that leans towards godliness. How do you
[1:58:53] feed that?
[1:58:56] So what is it that these two dogs eat?
[1:59:00] Because this has to do with a spirit
[1:59:02] part of you. There's only one thing that
[1:59:05] the spirit eats.
[1:59:08] Word.
[1:59:11] Word. Nothing else enters your mind but
[1:59:15] perception.
[1:59:18] You literally cannot take a spoon of
[1:59:20] food and stick it in your brain.
[1:59:23] You understand? It's always going to be
[1:59:25] word.
[1:59:27] Word is what enters your mind. Here's
[1:59:30] the thing. You are either feeding the
[1:59:33] one dog truth. And if you feed the one
[1:59:37] dog truth, it will tend to godliness. If
[1:59:39] you feed the other one lies, it's going
[1:59:41] to tend to ungodliness. Right? So if you
[1:59:44] constantly hear truth, the god the good
[1:59:48] dog gets stronger and so does the desire
[1:59:52] in your members for righteousness,
[1:59:53] morality, good religion, wholesome
[1:59:56] lifestyle. If you are constantly hearing
[1:59:58] falsehood and lies, the black dog gets
[2:00:00] stronger and therefore the desire for
[2:00:03] worldliness, immorality,
[2:00:04] unrighteousness, disinterest in the word
[2:00:06] of God gets stronger.
[2:00:09] Word comes to you by what means? Reading
[2:00:12] material, watching screens, hearing
[2:00:15] speech, seeing and interpreting
[2:00:17] manifestations and foolishness of
[2:00:20] preaching.
[2:00:22] That's how word comes to you.
[2:00:25] In other words, you can feed yourself
[2:00:27] lies by watching a movie. You can feed
[2:00:30] yourselves lies by watching a play
[2:00:34] at school. You can feed yourselves lies
[2:00:37] by being at a worldly concert.
[2:00:40] You can feed yourself lies by anything
[2:00:42] that interprets itself into word and
[2:00:44] brings a perception.
[2:00:47] And whichever one you feed the most is
[2:00:51] what your flesh is going to tend to.
[2:00:56] Truth or lies enters your mind by forms
[2:00:59] of word. You interpret that. You make it
[2:01:03] meaningful to you in a way that benefits
[2:01:06] you. And then you get the feeling
[2:01:08] inside, I want that. Where did it come
[2:01:11] from? Something got in first.
[2:01:14] You're never going to want to smoke that
[2:01:17] first cigarette until someone lied to
[2:01:19] you
[2:01:21] that it's good.
[2:01:23] Ask any young man, young boy.
[2:01:26] I I was I was a prefect in high school
[2:01:29] and I had to watch these little 13 year
[2:01:31] olds come out of primary school and
[2:01:33] watch these older boys hook them
[2:01:37] or by their fathers or uncles and get
[2:01:39] them involved in the stuff. You're never
[2:01:41] going to You're never going to do it.
[2:01:44] You don't even I remember when my my son
[2:01:46] Jordan was 5 years old
[2:01:49] and um he told me, "I want to smoke." I
[2:01:52] said, "What?" He said, "I want to smoke.
[2:01:55] I want to try it." He said, "So many
[2:01:57] people doing it, that means it tastes
[2:01:59] nice."
[2:02:02] He thought it tastes good. And then we
[2:02:05] told him what it does and then it causes
[2:02:07] cancer and it's not really about the
[2:02:09] taste. and we try to explain addiction
[2:02:10] to him and that was it. We go to a
[2:02:12] restaurant, he sees someone smoking, he
[2:02:14] stands up and says, "Filthy habit."
[2:02:18] He did that to us several times. We had
[2:02:20] to go, "Excuse me, sir. Sorry." But it
[2:02:22] worked because some of those people will
[2:02:23] say, "I'm so sorry, sorry." And they put
[2:02:25] the the cigarette off.
[2:02:28] But the point is the perception of it is
[2:02:31] either it's going to taste nice because
[2:02:33] a kid looks at and say, "Why are people
[2:02:35] putting it in your mouth?" Because
[2:02:36] children always think if you put
[2:02:37] something in your mouth, it's because
[2:02:38] it's tasty. It's good to eat. So they
[2:02:41] they're watching that. So you're never
[2:02:43] going to know what it is unless someone
[2:02:47] tells you the truth about it. Most
[2:02:50] people who do it have a spirit on them
[2:02:53] that wants you to be in it with them.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:02:56] &gt;&gt; Because they're already trapped by it.
[2:02:59] They need you to do it so it makes them
[2:03:02] feel safe.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:03:06] Once you're hooked, then you're going to
[2:03:07] do that to somebody else. See, truth
[2:03:11] always comes as something that
[2:03:13] challenges your comfort zone. Lies
[2:03:16] always makes you feel safe. Truth makes
[2:03:19] you feel unsafe.
[2:03:22] &gt;&gt; Because truth challenges you.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Truth makes you shift. Truth makes you
[2:03:27] move. Truth puts a spike under you.
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Truth tells you you need to change your
[2:03:32] ways. Truth tells you that's wrong. You
[2:03:34] shouldn't get comfortable with that and
[2:03:36] you don't like it. Lies always makes you
[2:03:39] feel comfortable.
[2:03:42] Remember that young people, you get
[2:03:45] these friends. I I tell my boys, you
[2:03:47] know, um a lot of you don't know what
[2:03:49] it's like to be pastor's children. I'm
[2:03:51] going to give you an understanding. Uh
[2:03:54] some a lot of you get away with it and
[2:03:56] you don't know why you would see us
[2:03:59] being this way with our sons. My boys
[2:04:01] know you will never get into anybody
[2:04:04] else's car
[2:04:06] at campus, wherever. You don't get into
[2:04:09] their car. I don't care. They can be a
[2:04:11] best friend. You don't get into their
[2:04:12] car. Why? I've seen people getting into
[2:04:15] their car into someone's car and there's
[2:04:17] a gun in that car and something was done
[2:04:20] with that car and with the gun and if
[2:04:22] the police stop you, you are an
[2:04:24] accessory.
[2:04:26] You are associated with somebody that is
[2:04:29] and as a pastor's child, you only get
[2:04:31] one chance to be wrong and then you're
[2:04:33] labeled.
[2:04:35] You're done for. Anybody else gets away
[2:04:37] with it, but if you're a pastor's kid,
[2:04:39] it's over. It's tickets for you and your
[2:04:41] father.
[2:04:43] We don't get second chances.
[2:04:46] We don't get to fool around and go to
[2:04:48] dancers and and feel it's okay. You find
[2:04:50] people take pictures of you posted on
[2:04:52] social media, but not a pastor's kid.
[2:04:55] You get posted, it hits your father's
[2:04:56] ministry.
[2:04:59] So with the preacher, you who are
[2:05:01] preachers bringing up children, you're
[2:05:03] going to see it. Your children are going
[2:05:05] to be the targets. Your wife is going to
[2:05:06] be the target. Everything we do and say
[2:05:09] is scrutinized.
[2:05:12] So unless you know my life, don't
[2:05:15] criticize me for how I bring up my
[2:05:17] children and and handle my house. If I
[2:05:19] don't want them to go with you in your
[2:05:21] car, even if you are a believer, there's
[2:05:24] a reason why. If you are going to do
[2:05:26] something that's sketchy for me that I
[2:05:29] don't agree with, even if you are my
[2:05:30] friend or my relative, it's my
[2:05:32] prerogative to say no to my children
[2:05:35] because I don't want them to be a part
[2:05:36] of something where they can be accused
[2:05:38] of something and and then it reflects
[2:05:40] back on me. Why? because I know what
[2:05:44] comes with the the the the deriding.
[2:05:48] It's unfair to them what people are
[2:05:51] going to say to them or about them when
[2:05:53] they are just human beings with errors
[2:05:55] and mistakes.
[2:05:57] You get into a car with a stranger with
[2:06:00] a friend at university, he drives, he
[2:06:03] exceeds the speed limit, he crashes into
[2:06:05] someone's car. It's my irresponsibility
[2:06:08] as a parent for not telling you you
[2:06:10] should never have gotten into that car.
[2:06:15] You want me, I've got to dedicate
[2:06:17] vehicles and cars and pray that you got
[2:06:19] the Holy Ghost in their car. Then you
[2:06:21] get into someone else's car with a
[2:06:23] booming, thumping worldly music. You get
[2:06:25] into an unbeliever's car at campus at
[2:06:28] university and you drive around with
[2:06:30] them. You're driving with the window
[2:06:31] open. There's Brother Alistister's son
[2:06:33] driving in a car and is thumping music
[2:06:35] AND SOMEBODY ELSE. NOBODY IS SEEING,
[2:06:37] nobody's going to know brother
[2:06:38] Alistister's son or brother Alistister's
[2:06:40] car broke down on that day and he needed
[2:06:43] his friend to bring his son home.
[2:06:45] Nobody's going to accept that.
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; It's going to be brother Declan or
[2:06:48] Brother Jordan uh listening to worldly
[2:06:51] music with their friends. Some of you
[2:06:53] here would not even accept the truth
[2:06:56] because you're most likely wanting to
[2:06:58] have the ability to criticize and hit
[2:07:00] someone down.
[2:07:03] This is why we are that way. And don't
[2:07:06] let it be just to pastor's kids. You
[2:07:08] parents should have responsibilities
[2:07:11] with your kids. Do not trust strangers.
[2:07:16] Do not trust family members who are not
[2:07:18] even in the message. And even in the
[2:07:19] message, vet them.
[2:07:24] I don't trust anyone.
[2:07:28] anyone
[2:07:31] because and I don't even mean in a bad
[2:07:33] way. You just don't know my rules of my
[2:07:35] house. You most likely are going to tell
[2:07:37] my kids to do something I don't agree
[2:07:40] with. If I feel for me it's like if I
[2:07:43] feel my kid has had enough sugar for
[2:07:45] that for that day, you're going to tell
[2:07:47] my kid, "No, don't worry. It's okay. You
[2:07:48] can have it. It's my treat to you. your
[2:07:51] treat to my kid
[2:07:54] when I know what he what he needs for
[2:07:56] his body and his life. You are teaching
[2:07:59] him to break my rules. How responsible
[2:08:01] are you as a message adult?
[2:08:07] And it's not even about sin. It's just
[2:08:09] about sugar.
[2:08:13] Or it could be you letting my son play a
[2:08:16] game on your cell phone, which I don't
[2:08:18] approve of. I don't want my kids. My
[2:08:20] kids know my rules are you are not
[2:08:22] allowed to use anybody else's cell
[2:08:24] phone. Why? I have no control over what
[2:08:26] stuff they have on their phone. Anything
[2:08:29] can pop up on there. You will not touch
[2:08:32] another person's cell phone or look in
[2:08:34] their cell phone. I'm trusting you with
[2:08:35] that.
[2:08:37] This is not a time to feel like and this
[2:08:39] is my rules. This is not a message. This
[2:08:42] is my rules for my house. But at the
[2:08:45] same time, I'm trusting them to go off
[2:08:46] in the world and make their decisions.
[2:08:50] And if they mess up, they know they can
[2:08:52] come back to mommy and daddy. And we
[2:08:53] will have grace with them. We will talk
[2:08:55] with them. We will lead them through it.
[2:08:57] And I want to tell young people who are
[2:08:58] going to be baptized, this is church
[2:09:01] where if you do something wrong, you can
[2:09:04] come back to us and we will help you
[2:09:06] heal.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; We will not be those people who will
[2:09:09] crush you and walk over you and mess up
[2:09:12] your testimony everywhere else. We deal
[2:09:14] with you with grace and with wisdom
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; because we don't believe in a boogeyman.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:09:21] &gt;&gt; we believe in the truth.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; Young people today, what is the message?
[2:09:26] I fear for you. This is the reason why
[2:09:28] my passion is the way it is now for the
[2:09:32] message today. I fear for you young
[2:09:35] people because I feel that you don't
[2:09:36] really know what the message is.
[2:09:39] Those of them listening online, those in
[2:09:42] Newcastle,
[2:09:44] those here sitting here, I feel like you
[2:09:47] don't really know what the message is. I
[2:09:49] have spoken to many people who have left
[2:09:51] the message and I've discovered the same
[2:09:54] thing over and over again. They left
[2:09:56] something that wasn't even the message.
[2:09:59] They thought they knew the message
[2:10:02] because the message to them was the Cood
[2:10:05] rules and and laws.
[2:10:08] What they are leaving is not even the
[2:10:10] message. What they are leaving is
[2:10:11] actually a lie that they lived under.
[2:10:14] And they're now heading for another
[2:10:16] realm of lies which they don't even
[2:10:18] realize.
[2:10:20] So I want to tell you plainly today what
[2:10:23] is the message?
[2:10:25] Number one, the message under the first
[2:10:28] two pulls is the exposing of the spirit
[2:10:31] of lies. It had to take an Elijah
[2:10:33] anointing to tell us what is not the
[2:10:36] word.
[2:10:39] First part of brother Brandon's ministry
[2:10:40] is telling us what is not the word.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; Right? And we find that when the seals
[2:10:46] were open, what was the seven seals?
[2:10:49] Breaking out the lies.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; What the white horse ride is when you
[2:10:54] break open the lies, then you get the
[2:10:56] truth.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. So what next is the third pull
[2:11:00] ministry which is then after the lies
[2:11:02] have been pulled off now telling you the
[2:11:05] truth which has been hidden for
[2:11:07] generations.
[2:11:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; This is the open book the revealing of
[2:11:11] truth. The Bible becoming a new book.
[2:11:13] The hidden mysteries contained inside
[2:11:15] the seven seals.
[2:11:17] So what is the message?
[2:11:20] The message is the exposing of the
[2:11:22] spirit of lies and the revelation of God
[2:11:25] for our day.
[2:11:28] &gt;&gt; Everyone stops at the exposing of lies.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; That's why I'm saying you don't really
[2:11:34] know the message. So young people when
[2:11:37] you are asked today what do you believe
[2:11:39] in? If people ask you where you are
[2:11:42] university, campus, school, whatever,
[2:11:44] and they ask you what is what is it?
[2:11:46] What is the message? What is your
[2:11:47] answer? you will you the usual answer
[2:11:51] I've heard in the past is well in our
[2:11:52] church we don't do this we don't do this
[2:11:54] we don't do this we don't do that you
[2:11:56] still haven't told them the message you
[2:11:58] only told them what we don't do
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; maybe some of you bolder ones will say
[2:12:03] well God sent a prophet right and most
[2:12:07] of the time I've heard the older
[2:12:09] generation start with that saying uh we
[2:12:12] don't believe in the trinity god sent a
[2:12:14] prophet the prophet revealed to us we
[2:12:16] don't believe in the trinity we don't
[2:12:17] believe the original sin is an apple. We
[2:12:20] don't believe Jesus was born the 25th of
[2:12:21] December. We don't believe. We don't
[2:12:23] believe. We don't believe. But what do
[2:12:24] you believe?
[2:12:27] What is the truth then? That doesn't
[2:12:30] even work today anymore. God send a
[2:12:33] prophet doesn't work because there's so
[2:12:35] many prophets.
[2:12:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; Uh telling them what you don't do. Oh,
[2:12:40] so you guys are like uh Mormons.
[2:12:43] Oh, so you guys are like Seven Day
[2:12:45] Adventists. Oh, so you guys are like
[2:12:46] this. OH, YOU'RE LIKE THAT. I KNOW
[2:12:47] ANOTHER. NO, NO. And then you No, no,
[2:12:49] no. We not like that. They still
[2:12:50] denominations. No, but you are like
[2:12:52] that. Oh, you believe the father AND
[2:12:54] SON, SO YOU LIKE JEHOVAH'S WITNESS. NO,
[2:12:56] NO, WE'RE NOT LIKE THAT. Right now,
[2:12:58] you're struggling because you actually
[2:13:00] don't know what you believe.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; You only know what you don't believe.
[2:13:07] Now, here's a problem with that. That
[2:13:09] doesn't work today. The new generation
[2:13:12] doesn't even do that.
[2:13:15] My sons and your children are not even
[2:13:17] going to do that. When they speak to
[2:13:19] people on the outside, they're not even
[2:13:20] going to say, "God sent a prophet." They
[2:13:22] got a problem with that. I don't know
[2:13:24] what's the problem, but they just have a
[2:13:26] problem with that. They don't go around
[2:13:28] saying, "God sent a prophet." They don't
[2:13:29] even go around saying we don't do this.
[2:13:31] We don't do this in our They don't even
[2:13:33] do that. Frankly, I don't even know what
[2:13:36] they do.
[2:13:38] Maybe we should have some conversations
[2:13:40] with them.
[2:13:42] More than likely what I've seen is you
[2:13:44] shy away from conversations altogether.
[2:13:52] You know, I remember 20, what was it?
[2:13:53] 20, 22, I think. I was in a a youth
[2:13:56] meeting there in the Malvin church. And
[2:13:58] I said to the young people, you know,
[2:14:00] there are
[2:14:02] the usual issues with young people is
[2:14:04] courtship, dating, how to get a
[2:14:06] girlfriend, how to eventually get to
[2:14:07] marriage, what's the right process, blah
[2:14:09] blah blah. Boring, boring, boring. Okay,
[2:14:13] you can't even deal with that stuff
[2:14:14] today. So I said to them, you know
[2:14:17] what's your problem? message children,
[2:14:20] you are as boring as a piece of plywood.
[2:14:24] You literally do nothing. You read
[2:14:27] nothing. You sit at home and do nothing
[2:14:30] because you are told we don't do this,
[2:14:32] we don't do this, we don't do that. You
[2:14:33] play no games. You don't play sport. You
[2:14:37] sit at home. Now all that you are is a
[2:14:39] cell phone reader
[2:14:41] or a cell phone user. There is nothing
[2:14:44] to you. You don't read Shakespeare. You
[2:14:47] don't read Jeffrey Schoer. You don't
[2:14:49] even know who that is.
[2:14:52] You don't need read John Steinbeck. You
[2:14:54] don't read philosophy. So if someone
[2:14:56] even talks to you over a coffee, you
[2:14:58] have nothing to say. You are boring.
[2:15:04] But if they talk about movies,
[2:15:07] celebrities, or watch on social media,
[2:15:10] you like, "Yeah, girl.
[2:15:13] Now we're talking."
[2:15:16] Huh? That's who you are. That does not
[2:15:19] make a marriage
[2:15:21] because you got to be stuck in the house
[2:15:23] with someone 7 days a week, 3565
[2:15:26] days a year
[2:15:28] and then you lose the ability because
[2:15:31] you can't talk about anything. So you
[2:15:33] don't talk about anything.
[2:15:36] You're totally boring, bland, and
[2:15:39] useless. And you get offended when
[2:15:42] someone does talk to you about things
[2:15:45] important.
[2:15:47] Why? Because you are feeding yourselves
[2:15:50] nonsense.
[2:15:52] Here's what I'm hearing now from message
[2:15:54] boys.
[2:15:56] We can't talk to girls. We go and say
[2:15:59] hello. They literally cannot talk. They
[2:16:02] cannot say anything. And I see it. I go
[2:16:04] to youth meetings and I try to ask a
[2:16:06] question and they look at me like
[2:16:13] So, what do you guys think about this
[2:16:15] that's happening in the world?
[2:16:19] You know that awkward smile like they
[2:16:21] constipated.
[2:16:23] That's what I'm getting. Like when we
[2:16:26] were youth in the message, it was like,
[2:16:28] "Brother, can you please explain this? I
[2:16:30] read this in in uh in the token message.
[2:16:32] I read this in Christ the mystery.
[2:16:33] Please can you explain that? What does
[2:16:35] it mean by this? Please can you reexlain
[2:16:36] predestination?" No. Now we get zip
[2:16:40] nothing. Why? Because you don't know the
[2:16:43] message. You don't read. You're not
[2:16:46] putting truth in. But you want something
[2:16:49] magical to work.
[2:16:52] The new generation does not even do
[2:16:54] that. You don't know the message. You
[2:16:56] don't know the seals. You don't even
[2:16:58] want to know the seals.
[2:17:00] But then you come and argue with us
[2:17:02] about the rules. What is am I allowed to
[2:17:05] do this? Brother Alistister. Am I
[2:17:06] allowed to do this? Is it okay to marry
[2:17:08] this person? Is it okay to have this
[2:17:11] kind of marriage? Is it okay to You want
[2:17:14] us to make your life work for you, but
[2:17:16] you're not doing anything to put truth
[2:17:19] inside.
[2:17:21] That's unfair.
[2:17:24] That's unfair. I'm not here to work for
[2:17:26] you to make your life better.
[2:17:29] You got to make your life better.
[2:17:31] If what you do is always try to answer
[2:17:33] that you make a difference. You meet
[2:17:35] people out there and say, "Well, we're
[2:17:36] in the message. We don't do this. We
[2:17:38] don't do that. You guys do this." So,
[2:17:39] what you are doing is you are separating
[2:17:41] yourself from other people and making it
[2:17:43] look like they are not as good as you.
[2:17:45] You're already on the wrong foot. How
[2:17:48] are you ever going to get them to
[2:17:49] believe truth? You are just telling them
[2:17:52] you follow lies, we don't follow lies.
[2:17:54] But you're not telling them truth.
[2:17:58] That's not what we believe. All the dos
[2:18:01] and don'ts of the message is not the
[2:18:03] message. It's common sense. Don't smoke
[2:18:07] is not the message. It's common sense.
[2:18:10] Don't drink. Don't for all the That's
[2:18:14] not the message.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; It's righteousness.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:18:24] TV is going to make you stupid. If you
[2:18:27] weren't stupid before, you're going to
[2:18:29] become increasingly stupid.
[2:18:33] Soul will social media. I hear it. I
[2:18:36] hear how you young people talk. I can
[2:18:39] barely understand some of the words now.
[2:18:41] You talk in in abbreviations.
[2:18:45] BDW, lol. And that's only the calm ones.
[2:18:50] I don't even know all the other ones. I
[2:18:52] sometimes listen to them talking. I have
[2:18:53] no clue what they're saying. They're not
[2:18:55] even talking English. Can you imagine
[2:18:58] one day you're talking to your husband
[2:18:59] at coffee bw.
[2:19:04] and he makes a joke. Lol.
[2:19:07] That's what I envision happening. I
[2:19:10] dread to think of the marriages I'm
[2:19:12] going to counsel when I'm 60.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; As it is, it's tough now. Can you
[2:19:19] imagine me trying to counsel young
[2:19:22] people who are in their 40s but acting
[2:19:24] like teenagers?
[2:19:30] That's not only
[2:19:32] When you tell people what you don't
[2:19:34] believe, you are only exposing what not
[2:19:36] to believe. This is why you struggle.
[2:19:39] This is why from our last segment we we
[2:19:42] spoke about gray areas. Why do you make
[2:19:44] gray areas to live in? Because your soul
[2:19:46] is not believing in truth yet. You are
[2:19:49] trying to make the exposing of lies your
[2:19:52] faith and your religion. You are trying
[2:19:55] to make the rules your faith. You cannot
[2:19:57] have faith on rules.
[2:20:00] Okay. The soul can only place faith in
[2:20:03] truth. So what is the truth that we are
[2:20:06] believing in? This is why people like
[2:20:08] believe the sign and all these anti-
[2:20:10] message people why they attack us and
[2:20:13] call us brandites because you behave
[2:20:15] like brainwashed fools doing what you
[2:20:18] are TOLD TO DO BUT HAVING NOTHING in
[2:20:21] your heart that creates faith.
[2:20:24] Don't don't bluff yourself. You look
[2:20:26] like a brainwashed person. You look like
[2:20:28] an unhappy person. YOU LOOK LIKE A
[2:20:30] PERSON SAYING, "I'm going in the
[2:20:32] rapture.
[2:20:35] Yay."
[2:20:37] That's what you look like. I'm so glad
[2:20:39] to be a child of God. It's it's, you
[2:20:42] know, it's emanating from me.
[2:20:47] That's what you look like. You literally
[2:20:49] look like a cult, like you're
[2:20:51] controlled, like a man is holding you,
[2:20:53] like he's got you by the throat and
[2:20:55] telling you where to go and what to do.
[2:20:57] You make brother Brandham even look like
[2:20:59] a false prophet by the manifestations.
[2:21:06] They have a point
[2:21:09] and because you major on the dos and
[2:21:12] don'ts and don't get to what the truth
[2:21:14] actually is. And of course they are so
[2:21:17] wrong. Do we really think that God
[2:21:21] that all there is to God is exposing
[2:21:23] lies and judging people?
[2:21:26] Did you really think that that God just
[2:21:28] came to tell us how bad you are, how how
[2:21:31] much of a sinner you are? You doing this
[2:21:33] like God is this micromanager that's
[2:21:35] watching you every move. But you didn't
[2:21:36] do this right. You didn't do that right.
[2:21:38] You should have done it this way. You
[2:21:39] should have done it this way. It would
[2:21:40] have been quicker. If you did it this
[2:21:42] way, you'd have been more successful.
[2:21:45] I had a parent like that. I'll be
[2:21:46] pulling my hair out.
[2:21:49] The sad reality is that most message
[2:21:52] people and especially young people who
[2:21:54] go to camp after camp
[2:21:56] don't know what the seals are.
[2:21:59] They don't know what they really are.
[2:22:01] They don't even care to know what they
[2:22:02] are, what the thunders are. I I said
[2:22:05] this to you young men. You're going to
[2:22:07] lead your house one day. You're going to
[2:22:09] be the man of your house one day. You
[2:22:12] can never be the man of your house when
[2:22:14] your wife knows more of the word than
[2:22:15] you.
[2:22:20] This is the truth. You cannot be a
[2:22:22] leader. How can you be the head as
[2:22:25] Christ is the head of the man and you
[2:22:27] are the head of the woman, but she knows
[2:22:28] more of the word than you.
[2:22:30] She can teach you the word. Something
[2:22:33] wrong there.
[2:22:35] So as young men, be like David. Take the
[2:22:39] law of God, put it in your heart. Yes.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; If people don't even know who the devil
[2:22:45] is, you don't know who your enemy is,
[2:22:47] how do you expect to overcome? If you
[2:22:49] don't have the revelation of the spirit
[2:22:51] of truth, if you don't know who God is,
[2:22:53] who are you really worshiping?
[2:22:56] You have no effective plan of wisdom for
[2:22:59] a secure future. This is the whole point
[2:23:02] of this series on knowing God and
[2:23:04] knowing the devil.
[2:23:06] If you don't know the spirit of truth
[2:23:08] and the spirit of lies, if you don't
[2:23:09] understand, you will have no plan for a
[2:23:13] secure future. You are heading into an
[2:23:15] unhappy marriage someday. You are
[2:23:17] heading into a situation where there are
[2:23:19] ch Listen people, you are going to be
[2:23:22] believers who might have children who
[2:23:23] are problematic.
[2:23:25] Do you have the faith to deal with that?
[2:23:29] If you crash and burn young people right
[2:23:32] now for every crisis you just crash and
[2:23:34] burn, how are you going to take care of
[2:23:37] a family one day? If you don't have the
[2:23:40] drive to work hard, to earn money, to
[2:23:43] set yourself up for the future, to not
[2:23:45] shy away from hard work, how are you
[2:23:47] going to take care of a family?
[2:23:50] I tell you what, there's no miracles for
[2:23:52] that.
[2:23:55] There's no miracles for that.
[2:23:58] That's hard work and you got to put it
[2:24:00] in. Young men, study the word. Study the
[2:24:04] message. Take time off. Take time off to
[2:24:08] learn the word of God. Put some truth
[2:24:10] in. Have conversations. Ask the
[2:24:13] questions. Don't sit quiet at youth
[2:24:15] meetings. We have those youth meetings
[2:24:17] not to waste our time with you. Let's
[2:24:19] have the discussions. LET'S HEAR WHAT'S
[2:24:21] BUGGING YOU. Let's hear what's troubling
[2:24:23] you. We even the last youth meeting, we
[2:24:26] put out papers. So that because you
[2:24:28] don't want to talk, we're going to make
[2:24:30] you talk silently. So we make you write
[2:24:32] it in papers and pass it down
[2:24:34] anonymously and then we read it out and
[2:24:36] say, "Oh, some person asked this." But
[2:24:39] at some point, you need to start owning
[2:24:40] up to what's bugging you.
[2:24:44] It's not good enough to hide behind the
[2:24:46] safety of the group. You have to come
[2:24:48] out and expose yourself. Say, "Brother
[2:24:50] Al, I don't understand this. I'm
[2:24:52] struggling with this concept of the
[2:24:54] message. I'm struggling with what you
[2:24:56] said there. I did those things. I had
[2:24:58] these arguments with my dad when we went
[2:25:01] to youth camps. We stood up and spoke.
[2:25:03] When we didn't agree with something, we
[2:25:05] said, "We don't know this. We don't
[2:25:06] understand this. We don't agree this.
[2:25:08] Please explain this again." And we put
[2:25:10] the challenge upon the preachers feet to
[2:25:14] answer us.
[2:25:16] In conclusion,
[2:25:18] young people, I just want to say this.
[2:25:20] the beginning of this new year. The
[2:25:22] benefit of this message of truth to you
[2:25:25] as a young person is it's going to
[2:25:28] guarantee you a truly happy,
[2:25:32] healthier life and an easier path to
[2:25:35] achieve your purpose than anything else
[2:25:38] in this world. That's the truth. The
[2:25:42] reason you don't see it now or you don't
[2:25:45] see your purpose in God is because you
[2:25:47] have always been living by falsehood and
[2:25:50] lies.
[2:25:52] If the light of your soul is darkness,
[2:25:56] that is lies, then the entire body is
[2:25:59] filled with darkness. You know that's a
[2:26:02] scripture, right?
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; The eyes is the light of the body. If
[2:26:06] the light in your body is darkness, if
[2:26:08] the light in your eye is darkness, your
[2:26:11] entire body is filled with darkness.
[2:26:14] That means if you take in lies, your
[2:26:16] entire body is going to live with lies.
[2:26:18] If the light in your body is light,
[2:26:21] which is the word, which is the truth,
[2:26:23] then the entire body is filled with
[2:26:25] wisdom. Simply put, if you're a young
[2:26:29] man, you take in the truth of God's
[2:26:31] word. If the the light in your eye is
[2:26:35] light, you will be the best husband, the
[2:26:38] best father, the best friend, the best
[2:26:42] confidant, the most reliable worker, the
[2:26:45] most reliable boss, the most truthful
[2:26:48] person in your neighborhood, the most
[2:26:50] trustworthy person. When there's
[2:26:52] trouble, when there's struggle, when the
[2:26:53] pressures come upon this life in your
[2:26:56] neighborhood, they will run to you for
[2:26:58] advice. They will look to you for help.
[2:27:01] This is who you will you will be. But if
[2:27:03] you don't take the word, you will be the
[2:27:05] other person running to something else
[2:27:08] for help. Because that's what lies do.
[2:27:11] It's made to keep you trapped by a
[2:27:14] boogeyman. And the worst thing is how do
[2:27:18] you conjure up something terrifying to
[2:27:22] make somebody feel safe? It's just so
[2:27:25] sad.
[2:27:27] May the Lord bless you. Let's bow our
[2:27:28] heads together.
