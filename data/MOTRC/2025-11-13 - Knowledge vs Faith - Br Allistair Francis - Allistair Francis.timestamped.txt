[0:01] What is the truth of this,
[0:04] Sean? What is that
[0:07] apple?
[0:09] Huh? Who says it's an apple?
[0:13] Casey, it's an apple. Yeah. Uh,
[0:19] no. What happened to our Africanas?
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Mark, well, you have a Uber
[0:24] surname.
[0:25] &gt;&gt; I'm French. [laughter]
[0:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[0:30] You said it's an apple. Yes, Seth. It's
[0:33] an apple. In Africans, it's apple.
[0:37] What's it in sha? Brother Robert.
[0:40] Brother Robert. Huh?
[0:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. Anybody knows what it's in Zulu?
[0:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, how about Japanese?
[0:55] [laughter]
[0:55] How about Chinese? How about Arabian?
[0:59] Yeah. So, is it an apple or is it not an
[1:02] apple?
[1:04] Okay. What is the truth of this apple?
[1:08] How do you know it's an apple? Where are
[1:10] your link sources and reliable
[1:13] [laughter]
[1:15] people with credentials?
[1:18] What is the truth? What color is it?
[1:22] Huh?
[1:23] &gt;&gt; Red. Yes.
[1:26] And and where does it where do you get
[1:27] it from?
[1:30] &gt;&gt; A tree. It grows in a tree.
[1:33] So all we got so far are facts.
[1:36] Now I want someone here to tell me what
[1:40] is the truth of an apple.
[1:43] I'm waiting.
[1:46] What is the truth of an apple?
[1:50] You know what's the truth of an apple?
[1:52] Somebody who doesn't know what it's
[1:53] called, where it comes from, but they
[1:55] know what to do with it.
[1:59] What do you do with an apple?
[2:02] &gt;&gt; Right now, how many of you can describe
[2:04] to me in the best language what an apple
[2:07] tastes like?
[2:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, buddy.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; A strawberry.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:22] &gt;&gt; Anybody? Anybody who's so educated?
[2:25] Where is it? Yes.
[2:29] Like juicy.
[2:32] Yeah, it is. It is juicy. But who can
[2:35] describe to me what it tastes like,
[2:37] [clears throat] Abby? It's sweet. Yeah,
[2:41] but what's sweet? Sweet has mean sugary.
[2:44] You adults who are you got your degrees
[2:47] and you guys with degrees in whatever.
[2:50] &gt;&gt; What does it taste like?
[2:53] [laughter]
[2:55] &gt;&gt; There you go. It tastes like an apple.
[2:57] WHICH MEANS AFTER 6,000 YEARS of eating
[3:00] apples, you cannot describe to me what
[3:03] an apple tastes like. YOU CANNOT TELL me
[3:06] what it tastes like. YOU CANNOT EVEN USE
[3:09] FIVE words to describe it. You can only
[3:11] tell me it tastes like an apple. SHE
[3:13] MEANS ALL THE KNOWLEDGE. YES, brother
[3:15] Liam.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; Doesn't taste like an orange.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[3:22] [laughter]
[3:23] So, all we have is,
[3:27] reliable sources,
[3:29] but the truth you cannot describe.
[3:34] You can give it to an infant who doesn't
[3:36] know what it is, where it comes from, uh
[3:39] how it grows, what its seed looks like,
[3:41] what its tree looks like, which ground
[3:43] it grew up in. Most of you here don't
[3:46] even know what's the biological name of
[3:47] apple,
[3:49] right? Do you know that once apple was
[3:52] the universal name for all fruit? This
[3:55] is why you have art apple and every
[3:57] other apple in the Dutch because they
[4:00] used to call any fruit the apple of the
[4:03] tree. Did you know that?
[4:06] BUT YOU CANNOT TELL ME THE TRUTH OF AN
[4:08] APPLE. BUT YET YOU KNOW the truth of an
[4:11] apple.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; YES.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE TRUTH of an apple even
[4:15] though you you you GOT ALL THE FACTS AND
[4:18] YOU THE FACTS ARE NOT EVEN TASTY.
[4:22] Whether it's red, whether it's shape,
[4:24] whatever it is, what grounded grow, none
[4:26] of that is important. NONE OF THAT
[4:28] PRODUCES ANY POWER IN YOU. BUT YOU know
[4:32] it's good for you. You know you can eat
[4:35] it. You know you can taste it. You can't
[4:37] EXPLAIN THAT.
[4:39] THAT'S the truth.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; The rest is evidence and knowledge.
[4:47] Oh, taste and see
[4:51] &gt;&gt; that the Lord is good
[4:55] &gt;&gt; with all the knowledge you can have,
[4:57] with all the preaching, with all the
[4:58] theology, with all the Bible schools,
[5:00] with all the the doctrines you can have,
[5:03] if you don't taste, all you have is
[5:06] knowledge.
[5:08] This is the reason all those who study
[5:12] theology and Bible and even the message
[5:16] if you haven't met him
[5:19] &gt;&gt; the only people who POSSESS THE TRUTH
[5:21] AND ARE POSSESSED OF THE TRUTH are the
[5:24] ones who have met him
[5:26] &gt;&gt; who have tasted of the heavenly gift
[5:29] that's the people who have the truth
[5:32] &gt;&gt; and those are the people who can tell
[5:34] you when you're preaching in error
[5:37] And when you're pre when you're not, you
[5:39] can have a lady who is a housewife who
[5:42] irons clothes and washes CLOTHES AND
[5:44] STUFF AND DOES NOT STUDY DOCTRINES, BUT
[5:46] SHE CAN tell you you're preaching wrong.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Because she has tasted.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; So if you believe in facts, I want to
[5:57] ask you young people today, how much
[5:59] evidence do you need to fully believe
[6:01] that God exists and he created the
[6:03] universe and the world we live in today?
[6:06] How much evidence is enough to make you
[6:09] believe in God?
[6:11] How about when does the evidence stop?
[6:16] Right now, science is a baby. Do you
[6:19] know that?
[6:20] &gt;&gt; Science like started a few hundred years
[6:22] ago because that's when they were able
[6:24] to collect evidence that could prove
[6:26] anything or something.
[6:30] &gt;&gt; Truth needs an element of faith.
[6:34] See, that's the thing. Evidence doesn't
[6:38] need faith. Evidence needs recognition.
[6:41] Which is why when you're having
[6:42] conversation with people and you're
[6:44] presenting evidence and facts and and
[6:46] concepts and whatever, they're just
[6:48] looking at it as knowledge.
[6:50] You're not telling them truth because
[6:53] the truth is too much
[6:56] for them to be TO TO BE PUT INTO WORDS.
[6:59] If truth does not come by revelation,
[7:01] you cannot possess it. Amen.
[7:05] &gt;&gt; If everything is about evidence, where
[7:07] is the faith?
[7:09] &gt;&gt; If there is no faith, there is no power.
[7:12] IF THERE IS NO POWER, there is no change
[7:14] to life. You can GIVE PEOPLE ALL THE
[7:16] FACTS, IT WILL NOT CHANGE their life.
[7:18] [snorts]
[7:20] What do people Why do people not believe
[7:24] though there is an abundance of
[7:26] evidence?
[7:29] Right? What about the seventh seal?
[7:32] Listen to this saints. We we have to
[7:34] preach the seven seal TO PEOPLE. WE HAVE
[7:36] TO PREACH WHAT THE FIRST FOLD IS, the
[7:37] second fold, third fold. Do you is there
[7:39] any mystery as to why people don't
[7:42] believe what we say when we present them
[7:45] evidence?
[7:47] &gt;&gt; Because unless they taste and see, they
[7:50] will never know. Yeah,
[7:52] &gt;&gt; YOU CAN PRODUCE ALL THE QUOTES YOU want
[7:54] in a specific format, under a different
[7:57] subject, under a different heading,
[7:58] under a different teaching. Unless they
[8:00] connect with the Holy Spirit himself,
[8:03] there's no way, there's no convincing.
[8:06] There's no certain ministry.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[8:11] I want to ask I want to be as clear with
[8:13] you as possible.
[8:16] What proof do we have of Christ?
[8:19] What evidence do we have of Christ? the
[8:21] shroud of Turin,
[8:23] the witnesses of men. How do you know he
[8:26] was born of a virgin?
[8:28] How do you know he raised from the dead?
[8:32] How do you know who wrote to the book of
[8:34] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John? What
[8:36] evidence did do you have that the words
[8:39] written in those gospels are actually
[8:41] the word of Christ? Do you know?
[8:45] Can you prove it?
[8:47] Can you prove that Noah built an ark and
[8:49] there was a flood? Do you have evidence
[8:52] that Moses opened up the Red Sea? Do you
[8:55] have evidence that Daniel killed Goliath
[8:58] with one stone?
[9:01] Do you have evidence, proof, facts,
[9:04] links, sources, or anyone with authority
[9:07] to tell you and prove to you everything
[9:10] that there is in the Bible?
[9:12] No, you don't. No one has it. Though
[9:16] people will try archaeology, this
[9:19] finding under the temple mount, this
[9:21] finding the sh of Turin, this in the
[9:23] cave, this, it proves nothing. It
[9:26] doesn't even matter.
[9:28] It's what you believe.
[9:31] &gt;&gt; It's not the evidence that changed lives
[9:34] and made people repent of sin. It's
[9:36] faith. IT'S THE BELIEF THAT it was truth
[9:40] that changed lives that changed
[9:42] governments and constitutions AND
[9:44] RESHAPED SOCIETY. IT WASN'T ACTUAL
[9:47] EVIDENCE. TODAY THEY THEY CRYING FOR
[9:50] EVIDENCE FOR A GOD FOR THE ONE WHO
[9:52] CREATED THE UNIVERSE. BUT THE FAITH
[9:54] changed people
[9:57] &gt;&gt; countries.
[9:58] The the FAITH CHANGES A DRUG ADDICT TO
[10:00] BEING CLEAN IN ONE DAY.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; NOT EVIDENCE.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[10:08] And I'm talking to you. What proof do we
[10:10] have of William Brandham?
[10:13] What proof do we have of the cloud
[10:15] outside of the picture? What proof do we
[10:18] have of the mysterious week when he
[10:19] preached the seals? Do you realize our
[10:22] entire teaching and belief is based on
[10:26] the dreams and visions of a man
[10:29] &gt;&gt; who was born in Kentucky,
[10:32] &gt;&gt; who claims to have had the angel visit
[10:35] him, who saw dreams and visions
[10:38] &gt;&gt; and who spoke in words that were
[10:39] uneducated
[10:41] &gt;&gt; and without proper grammar. You you mean
[10:44] our lives, our marriages, our raising of
[10:47] our children, the jobs we choose, the
[10:50] way we dress, the holiday places we go
[10:52] to is defined BY WHAT THAT MAN TAUGHT
[10:56] US.
[11:00] Why would you follow it?
[11:03] There's only one reason is because your
[11:06] faith changed you somehow.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; And you'll not change from that. No
[11:11] matter what evidence is produced in you,
[11:14] you and I know what it did for us
[11:17] &gt;&gt; because we've tasted.
[11:20] &gt;&gt; And when you've tasted, there's no words
[11:22] to describe it.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; You are the proof. You are the evidence.
[11:28] You are the only evidence. You you
[11:30] cannot even depend on on your your mind,
[11:33] your reasoning, on how you read the
[11:35] message and how you construct the
[11:37] doctrine out of it. YOU CAN'T. IT'S HOW
[11:40] IT IS REVEALED
[11:41] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN IT IS REVEALED when you TASTE
[11:43] AND WHAT IT DOES TO YOU.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; That's all.
[11:49] &gt;&gt; Other than that, you get nothing. You
[11:51] can produce the best music in your
[11:52] church. YOU CAN PRODUCE THE BEST
[11:54] ANOINTING IN YOUR CHURCH. YOU CAN HAVE
[11:56] PEOPLE FALLING DOWN, CRYING, AND ALL OF
[11:58] THAT. IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH TO PRODUCE
[12:00] anything
[12:01] &gt;&gt; or or prove to you anything or change
[12:04] you. There must be a personal connection
[12:07] with the truth. Amen.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; And the truth shall set you free.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Everything we have is based on another
[12:14] man's dreams, visions, and experiences.
[12:16] On that statement alone, that's enough
[12:18] to say, "Let's walk away."
[12:22] Because if I came here next week and
[12:23] told you I had dreams, visions, and
[12:25] prophecies, and I saw an angel, are you
[12:27] just going to believe me?
[12:29] No.
[12:31] What proof do we have of Christ?
[12:34] Why is your whole life depended on the
[12:37] words of Christ and prophets who you
[12:40] have not met, who you do not know?
[12:43] Truth is not received by evidence, young
[12:46] people, but by believing.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; This is why I'm encouraging you in your
[12:52] life with your husband and wife, with
[12:56] your children, with your parents,
[12:59] believe in each other.
[13:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:01] &gt;&gt; That's a better life.
[13:04] Believe in one another.
[13:06] Don't think proof and evidence makes
[13:08] your life better. It doesn't. It makes
[13:10] it worse.
[13:13] Believe one another.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Love one. To love one is to believe
[13:17] them. Amen.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Sons of God, truth is not received by
[13:23] evidence and by believing but by
[13:25] believing. Sons of God will find truth.
[13:29] And the truth is God. Amen.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; And the knowledge of the truth is Christ
[13:37] the word.
[13:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if the knowledge of the
[13:42] knowledge reveals the truth, then the
[13:45] word is truth. If the knowledge does not
[13:47] reveal the truth, it's not the truth.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; So you can have preaching and teaching
[13:53] in Christian churches that does not lead
[13:55] you to God. That means that knowledge is
[13:57] just knowledge. It's not truth. It
[14:00] doesn't have truth in it. See, Christ is
[14:03] the word and the word was made flesh and
[14:05] dwelt among us. The word was in the
[14:07] beginning with God and the word was God.
[14:11] &gt;&gt; The word must lead you to God.
[14:14] &gt;&gt; And when you taste that word and if you
[14:16] taste truth, you'll never change from
[14:18] it.
[14:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; If Christ reveals God, then Christ is
[14:23] God. Yes.
[14:24] &gt;&gt; Sons of God then who search for the word
[14:27] and find truth. Those sons of God search
[14:30] for Christ and find God. And what
[14:33] happens when you have truth? The truth
[14:35] possesses you.
[14:37] &gt;&gt; When sons of God find truth, then they
[14:40] are possessed by the truth.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; You love him, saints.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:45] &gt;&gt; Let's bow our heads together.
