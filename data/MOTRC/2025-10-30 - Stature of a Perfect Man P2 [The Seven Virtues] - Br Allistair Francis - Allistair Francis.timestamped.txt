[0:01] So now we can stand together and read
[0:03] the word of God. We're going to read
[0:05] from second Peter chapter 1
[0:09] uh verse 5.
[0:11] Am I plugged in here?
[0:14] Oh, there we go. So, our
[0:17] our series that I'm supposed I'm
[0:20] supposed to be in Newcastle and brother
[0:22] Shadrach was supposed to be speaking
[0:23] here this morning and uh so and our
[0:27] title is going to be the seven virtues.
[0:29] So, I'm actually preaching to the
[0:31] Newcastle people um this morning cuz I
[0:34] was supposed to be there. So, we're
[0:36] going to read 2 Peter 1:5-7.
[0:38] And beside this, giving all diligence,
[0:41] add to your faith virtue, and to virtue
[0:43] knowledge and to knowledge, temperance,
[0:46] and to temperance, patience, and to
[0:48] patience godliness, and to godliness,
[0:50] brotherly kindness, and to brotherly
[0:52] kindness, charity. Amen. The Lord add a
[0:55] blessing to his word. You may be seated.
[0:58] Um,
[1:00] getting to this uh subject, for those of
[1:02] you, I hope you were able to listen to
[1:05] the audios or watch it on YouTube. the
[1:08] first part that we did in Newcastle. So
[1:11] the stature of a perfect man and for a
[1:14] title the seven virtues. All right. So
[1:18] if you remember this uh you everybody
[1:20] knows this diagram by now. It's such a
[1:22] common diagram in the message. And um
[1:26] you can see that uh we've got the names
[1:30] of the ages on the I think I've got a
[1:32] pointer here. Where am I? There we go.
[1:37] Huh?
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Doesn't work on the screen.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; It doesn't work on the screen.
[1:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Useless thing.
[1:45] So the Ephesus to Leodosia, you got your
[1:48] church agents on the left and of course
[1:49] the uh the the messengers on the right
[1:53] that written in the center faith,
[1:55] virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience,
[1:56] godliness, brotherly kindness. Those are
[1:59] what we call virtues. Okay. So I want to
[2:05] today I I um we have a very simple
[2:07] message but I the simplicity of it is
[2:10] before you get to the whole series of it
[2:13] and understand all of those things just
[2:15] to understand what is the seven virtues
[2:19] right and when you look at those things
[2:20] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[2:22] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[2:24] and you look at that you think nothing
[2:27] there smacks of super supernatural
[2:31] these are things you can find in anybody
[2:33] body in the world.
[2:34] &gt;&gt; People have faith, virtue, knowledge,
[2:37] temperance. Some wealthy people have
[2:39] more temperance than we do.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; You know, uh patience. There are there
[2:44] are people in this world who who don't
[2:47] have the message. They're not
[2:48] Christians. They don't even read the
[2:49] Bible, but they don't drink alcohol.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; They don't smoke. They don't do drugs.
[2:54] They don't fornicate.
[2:56] They've got many of those or even all of
[2:59] those. I don't know. But there are many
[3:02] of these people who have these virtues.
[3:05] So what's so special about this that uh
[3:08] we have to have them and this is the
[3:10] reason why when you look at that they
[3:13] can never be the seven thunders the
[3:15] revelation of the seven thunders
[3:17] &gt;&gt; because that means a lot of people out
[3:19] in the world have these thunders then
[3:20] &gt;&gt; yes
[3:22] &gt;&gt; and they literally have it I've met
[3:24] message people since I'm a child there's
[3:27] no way I'm going to ever tell you I met
[3:29] someone who has all seven imperfection
[3:33] cuz you just someone's toes and
[3:35] you'll know how much of virtues they
[3:36] actually have or say something that
[3:39] insults them or you know you see all
[3:41] those virtues fly out the window.
[3:44] So don't tell me these are thunders and
[3:48] that that's the mystery that that was
[3:49] supposed to be revealed and brings you
[3:51] all to perfection. No, this not what it
[3:53] is. That's why you need to understand we
[3:55] need to understand what this is about.
[3:57] So let's not lose the focus that this
[4:01] whole thing what this this story is
[4:05] about is about developing the character
[4:08] of the believer
[4:10] &gt;&gt; for a purpose.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; Right. It's developing a believer into a
[4:15] mature individual. God needs you to have
[4:18] as much faith that is necessary to
[4:21] fulfill the purpose for your day. God
[4:24] needs you to have as much virtue as is
[4:27] necessary to fulfill the purpose for
[4:28] your day. As much knowledge, what is I
[4:31] mean where do we stop with knowledge?
[4:35] Just think just let's take knowledge for
[4:37] example. When do you stop reading the
[4:40] Bible and the message and say okay I
[4:42] know enough.
[4:45] &gt;&gt; Huh? Anybody?
[4:47] &gt;&gt; So when do you perfect knowledge?
[4:50] &gt;&gt; When do you stop learning? Never.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; So there is no fullness of knowledge.
[4:58] There is no fullness of virtue. In fact,
[5:00] in the Bible, it tells you if you are
[5:04] overrighteous, it's bad.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; Don't be over wicked and don't be
[5:09] overrighteous.
[5:10] &gt;&gt; You need the correct amount of it for
[5:13] your day.
[5:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; That is necessary. This is why you This
[5:18] is why I'm telling you, you literally
[5:20] will have people in the world who have
[5:22] some of these virtues in abundance and
[5:24] more than you could ever have it and yet
[5:27] will never believe the word of God
[5:30] &gt;&gt; or agree to do his purpose. Right? So
[5:34] these attributes,
[5:36] these virtues, these attributes, they
[5:38] are there to fulfill the purpose of God.
[5:41] for a believer to be developed towards
[5:44] something to fulfill your your purpose
[5:48] to its maximum potential,
[5:51] right? Like Samson needed enough of this
[5:56] character to bring down the Philistines
[5:59] and that was it. When he wasn't bringing
[6:02] down the Philistines, he was a horrible
[6:04] person.
[6:09] He literally was with the harlot
[6:12] and then the spirit of God came upon him
[6:14] to kill the Philistines and he went back
[6:16] to being with the harlot.
[6:19] Right?
[6:20] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. God is
[6:22] interested in his purpose.
[6:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; He's not interested in making you this
[6:26] bright shining human being that
[6:28] everybody's going to love and come to
[6:29] you and say, "Teach me more.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; Teach me more. You are the savior of
[6:34] mankind.
[6:36] No, he doesn't want to do that. He has
[6:39] chosen you to fulfill a purpose.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you imagine being in Luther's
[6:44] day and Luther has some of these and and
[6:47] Luther comes out and says, you know, the
[6:49] the the Holy Ghost inspires Luther and
[6:51] the just to live by faith. But Luther
[6:53] says, I want to reveal the seventh seal.
[6:57] &gt;&gt; You know, that's I just feel like I want
[7:00] to do that.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; It's not called for him to do that. He's
[7:04] not callering to reveal the seals or
[7:05] preach the church ages. He has he's been
[7:08] called to the just shall live by faith
[7:10] and that's what he's going to stick to.
[7:11] That's as much is the measure that he's
[7:14] ever going to have.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; And John Wesley, this is why they got so
[7:19] frustrated reading the book of
[7:21] Revelations. They couldn't understand
[7:22] it.
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[7:25] So these attributes and there are
[7:27] actually eight because with love there
[7:29] are eight that are mentioned here in
[7:32] this pyramid diagram they are in itself
[7:37] each one a mystery.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Faith is a mystery. Virtue is a mystery.
[7:43] Knowledge is a mystery. Each one on its
[7:45] own is a mystery. And then all eight and
[7:50] the way they are placed according to the
[7:52] word is another mystery.
[7:57] You can't start with brotherly kindness.
[8:01] You can't have patience at number two.
[8:05] You can't have godliness at number
[8:07] three.
[8:09] This this is what I mean. The way the
[8:12] prophet of the hour was inspired to set
[8:14] it out is perfectly the development.
[8:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; The actual development is perfect.
[8:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[8:23] &gt;&gt; Um Peter when he spoke this in in in 2
[8:27] Peter 1 5-7
[8:30] didn't realize that one day there was
[8:32] going to pro there's going to be a
[8:33] prophet who will come and show us the
[8:34] development of a of a child of God
[8:37] &gt;&gt; through the church ages.
[8:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This man Peter was just was
[8:41] saying, you know, add to your faith,
[8:42] virtue add to Peter wasn't even
[8:44] thinking, I am preaching this now
[8:46] because so and so 2,000 years from now
[8:48] is going to equate this to the thunders.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; He had no idea what he was what he was
[8:54] going to start off.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; This poor guy
[8:58] &gt;&gt; preached this, died, and he's in the
[9:00] sixth dimension somewhere and listening
[9:03] to people make a big deal about what
[9:04] kind of doctrine it is.
[9:07] No, they are the most sought after
[9:11] natures or character traits in the
[9:13] world. It doesn't matter which religion
[9:15] there is. Anybody who sees a person who
[9:18] has faith, virtue, knowledge,
[9:20] temperance, patience, godliness, and
[9:21] brotherly kindness, they look at you and
[9:23] say, "That is a good person.
[9:25] &gt;&gt; That is a great person." They will look
[9:28] at you and say, "I wish I could be like
[9:30] you." Or I wish all people could be like
[9:32] you. Everybody who sees a person with
[9:34] these attributes, it doesn't matter. You
[9:36] could be the worst person on earth. They
[9:39] will respect you and say that is a good
[9:42] person,
[9:44] &gt;&gt; but that's it. You're a good person,
[9:47] &gt;&gt; right? So, everybody wants to believe
[9:50] that they have faith.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Or that they have
[9:55] temperance or that they are patient etc.
[9:58] And all religions teach these
[10:01] characteristics as being what is good.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; All religions respect that.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Even Islam.
[10:11] &gt;&gt; They probably have a ninth one which
[10:13] says violence. I don't know but which is
[10:16] a holy war.
[10:19] I don't know how they pull all that
[10:21] together but they will also respect that
[10:26] you know. Oh, you can laugh at them and
[10:29] mock them and so on when it comes to
[10:31] Islam, but there's there's one thing
[10:34] about them. They keep their faith.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; They believe in something that they
[10:41] outshine people who they don't they
[10:43] don't only keep that. They make sure
[10:45] their kids are educated from 5 years
[10:46] old.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; They make sure their kids are dedicated
[10:50] to their prophet and their scripture.
[10:52] And then they teach their kids to uh to
[10:55] to dress according to their religion and
[10:58] keep it wherever they go and go to their
[11:01] holy temple and go for their Hajj and
[11:03] their you don't find that among other
[11:06] people
[11:08] and if that makes them uh so strong in
[11:12] their religion how you know somebody
[11:13] showed me this clip the other day of a
[11:15] of a a Muslim man who was being
[11:18] questioned by another Christian and the
[11:20] the the guy was saying to to him, "What
[11:22] is this?" He said to him, "Uh, why are
[11:25] you in a western country? Uh, why don't
[11:28] you stay in a Muslim country?" He said,
[11:30] "Cuz I can't spread Islam in a Muslim
[11:33] country.
[11:34] They already accepted Islam." He said,
[11:37] "Then why are you here in a Christian
[11:39] country?" "Well, I'm here to make
[11:40] converts."
[11:42] And he said, "And then the Christian guy
[11:44] is saying, but can I come to your
[11:45] country and make converts?" He said,
[11:47] "No."
[11:49] &gt;&gt; He said, "But why?" He said, "Well, it's
[11:51] not our fault. You are liberal.
[11:55] &gt;&gt; In our country, we will not allow you to
[11:57] make Christian converts because we
[11:59] believe Islam is the religion."
[12:03] He says, "Don't you think it's unfair?"
[12:04] He said, "Yeah, but this is how it is.
[12:07] So, my belief is I must be here in your
[12:11] country to make as many converts for
[12:13] Allah, but you can't come to my country
[12:15] and make converts to Christianity. It
[12:17] will kill you.
[12:21] Hey, that's faith.
[12:24] See,
[12:26] that's faith. And that's holding to
[12:27] their religion. It's a there are traits,
[12:30] there are characteristics. And you can
[12:32] admire some of these people for the way
[12:34] they think.
[12:36] It could be deluded. It could sound
[12:39] unfair. But this is the thing. These
[12:42] these are traits that people hold to.
[12:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. What is it that you need?
[12:48] Right? So there are they are right. All
[12:53] religions they are right. You're
[12:55] supposed to be like this. They all teach
[12:57] no matter what their beliefs are. They
[12:59] the holy people of all religions tell
[13:02] you how to be that marriage is good that
[13:05] you should be a good husband. You should
[13:07] be a good wife. You should be obedient
[13:09] children. All religions teach you. I
[13:11] don't know a religion that tells you you
[13:14] must be disrespectful to your parents or
[13:16] you must walk out of the house and or
[13:19] you must beat up your wife to a pulp or
[13:22] you must disrespect your husband. I
[13:24] don't know religious scriptures they all
[13:27] teach good things
[13:30] you know so they are right only they
[13:34] have made up ways to get these
[13:37] characteristics they have humanistic
[13:40] ways they have um uh uh ways to follow
[13:45] that are outside of the word of God for
[13:48] you to achieve them right like
[13:51] meditation like sit down calm yourself,
[13:54] do your breathing, meditate on something
[13:57] and then you will be become more
[13:58] patient,
[14:00] you know, um
[14:03] you can meditate as long as you want to.
[14:06] Someone comes and slap you in the face
[14:07] 10 times,
[14:09] you lose all the meditation you ever
[14:11] had.
[14:13] Right? So we even meet some people of
[14:16] the world who seem to have some of these
[14:18] attributes. You meet people in stores
[14:19] and in shopping areas, they are good
[14:22] people. They have they are kind. They
[14:24] are generous. They're help like like the
[14:26] guy who helped me yesterday. His name
[14:27] was Peacock.
[14:29] His his nickname was Peacock. And I met
[14:31] him and I I he helped me change my tire.
[14:34] I gave him something for his children,
[14:36] some money, what I had on me. I And
[14:38] there was another fellow walking by.
[14:40] He's just a beggar with three buckets on
[14:42] his back. He even offered me some uh
[14:45] some solution of soap and water which is
[14:48] carrying in his bucket to wash my hand.
[14:49] I looked in
[14:51] Hold on a second. I don't know. I don't
[14:53] know what's in there. Don't worry, my
[14:56] wife's got wet wipes. I'm going to But
[14:58] he got in there, too, and helped me out.
[15:00] You know, there are good people
[15:02] everywhere.
[15:04] And so, we meet a lot of people in the
[15:06] world with these attributes. Those who
[15:09] have them in measure are often
[15:12] respected. Like very often, you know,
[15:15] you meet you go to a hospital, you meet
[15:17] a doctor and you say, "I like him. He's
[15:19] a very patient man. You meet another
[15:22] one, I don't like him. His bedside
[15:24] manners are terrible. You know, he's so
[15:27] rude and he doesn't care for my
[15:29] feelings. You know, he's not there to
[15:31] care for your feelings. He's there to
[15:33] patch you up. You know, you must take
[15:35] care of your own feelings. But you
[15:38] respect that. You expect here am I
[15:40] standing there. I'm I'm lying on a bed.
[15:42] You know, I'm exposed. My arms are you
[15:44] poking me with stuff. At least be kind.
[15:47] He's not there to be kind. He's there to
[15:50] find a vein to stick a needle in and
[15:52] take some blood out. There's no kindness
[15:54] about that. But you feel like ah be
[15:57] gentle, you know, have some virtue. He
[16:00] wants to get the job done and get paid
[16:02] and get out of there, right? But you all
[16:05] know you want to see people with virtue,
[16:10] &gt;&gt; right? A lot of us are hypocrites,
[16:13] right?
[16:14] No, no, no.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; You know, you want the doctors to be
[16:17] gentle with you, but just watch yourself
[16:19] pulling out a splinter from your child's
[16:21] foot and the child is like, "Don't touch
[16:22] me." YOU'RE LIKE, "TRUST ME."
[16:26] You got to ply in your hand and a and a
[16:30] tweezer or something. Hold him still
[16:32] like get wife tape his mouth down OR
[16:34] SOMETHING.
[16:36] HOLD HIS HANDS.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; And then you think I want a doctor who's
[16:39] gentle.
[16:42] So virtues, brother Random called them
[16:46] virtues for a good reason and that's why
[16:48] we want to understand because we need to
[16:51] first understand why God chose to call
[16:53] them virtues and why they are placed the
[16:56] way they are right now. Brother Von
[16:59] desired to do a study but he just never
[17:02] got to do it. Right? I and I believe he
[17:04] left this hint for us. So if we read in
[17:07] the message statue of a perfect man
[17:09] paragraph 345 he says see what I mean
[17:13] see how these virtues these building
[17:16] materials
[17:18] typed in with the church messengers with
[17:20] the church ages you see how that fits in
[17:22] with the diagram
[17:25] &gt;&gt; building materials
[17:27] typed in with the church messengers and
[17:29] with the church ages. That's what our
[17:31] diagram was. Now, one of these days,
[17:35] we're going to take each one of these
[17:37] words and study them out and show that
[17:40] it proves this. It all goes together.
[17:43] One of these days, he only preached this
[17:46] in statue of a perfect man and
[17:48] blasphemous names and never did it.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; That's why I say he gave us the hint.
[17:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[17:54] &gt;&gt; we can do that, right? So, see how
[17:57] wonderful that is. He says, see what it
[17:59] does. All right. So virtue the word
[18:03] virtue
[18:05] comes from the Latin vir
[18:08] meaning strength.
[18:10] Virtue means strength. Okay. Why are
[18:14] these attributes called virtues? Uh
[18:18] nowhere in the Bible that will you ever
[18:20] find it written seven virtues. In fact
[18:23] there are eight spoken of in 2 Peter
[18:25] 15-7 which is including charity. And as
[18:28] we said the last time, these were
[18:30] labeled virtues based on the ancient
[18:33] Greek teachings, then adopted by
[18:36] Christians. Remember, the ancient Greeks
[18:38] had four virtues and then the Romans
[18:40] adopted that. And then over time, they
[18:43] were called that by the Christian
[18:44] church. Brother Brand didn't just come
[18:46] up and make it up himself. They were
[18:49] adopted uh traditions and teachings that
[18:53] came from the Greeks and the Romans and
[18:56] then adopted into the Christian church
[18:58] and then the prophet had to retach it.
[19:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:01] &gt;&gt; Right. So they are not mixed in with uh
[19:04] uh philosophies of educated men.
[19:08] And there are all kinds of theories on
[19:10] the virtues and some of the the
[19:12] teachings in Christian denominations.
[19:15] Uh if if you go for example, if you go
[19:17] to um any Protestant church and you ask
[19:20] them what are the virtues, the Christian
[19:22] virtues, they don't even tie it in with
[19:24] second Peter. They got other stuff that
[19:28] they'll teach you the the the eight
[19:30] virtues or the six virtues or seven
[19:32] virtues or something like that. Each
[19:34] denomination has its like own selection
[19:37] of virtues that they feel is, you know,
[19:40] what you're supposed to be keeping as a
[19:43] Christian. So it became a phrase the
[19:47] seven virtues coined by the ministry of
[19:49] the message made up by the ministry of
[19:51] the message and made very fashionable by
[19:54] the seven thunder seven virtues movement
[19:56] which was started over four decades ago.
[19:59] So now when you tell people that they
[20:02] they only talk about that.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; Right. The truth is there's nothing
[20:07] wrong with saying seven virtues because
[20:09] they are indeed virtues and they are
[20:12] indeed seven.
[20:14] Okay? So nobody's going to criticize you
[20:16] for saying seven virtues. And the thing
[20:19] is we can call them if you want
[20:22] characteristics or traits or natures or
[20:28] moral values or even good natures. You
[20:32] could say the seven good natures. all
[20:34] the seven moral values. You could call
[20:36] them whatever you want to, right? And
[20:39] you would all be about right. But the
[20:41] prophet called them virtues because of
[20:44] one important thing. They mean
[20:47] strengths.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; If you say moral values, it doesn't
[20:52] exactly say strengths.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[20:54] &gt;&gt; it doesn't. He calls them building
[20:56] materials.
[20:58] All right. Let's read statue of a
[21:00] perfect man. uh 24 paragraph 3. Now
[21:04] first you must have faith. Faith alone
[21:07] won't do it. You've got Peter said then
[21:10] add virtue to your faith. You must have
[21:13] virtue in order to add it to your faith.
[21:15] It may be the reason you don't have it
[21:18] because many churches of today teach you
[21:21] you don't have to have it or the days of
[21:23] its past. They don't have to have it.
[21:26] Only thing you have to do is just join
[21:28] church. Yeah. Days has passed. virtue.
[21:32] Anyone knows what the word virtue means?
[21:35] See, we must have it. If virtue went
[21:40] from him, do I need to move it? There
[21:43] you go. If virtue went from him to heal
[21:46] the woman that was sick,
[21:49] he's expecting the same virtue in his
[21:51] church because he was our example.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; If he had virtue to give to the people,
[21:57] he expects us to have virtue to give to
[21:59] the people. And what is virtue? Virtue
[22:03] is strength,
[22:05] power. Now in the denominations, they
[22:07] teach virtue to mean moral purity.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[22:13] &gt;&gt; Right. So with that, the only thing
[22:15] denominational churches teach as virtue
[22:18] is to be like
[22:21] uh have moral purity regarding like
[22:24] sexuality.
[22:27] to say she's a virtuous woman means she
[22:29] hasn't fornicated.
[22:31] So in other words, in the Christian
[22:33] church, if you talk about virtuous or
[22:36] virtue, they're referring to moral as in
[22:39] sexually moral purity. And that's where
[22:43] they stop. Brother Ram says virtue means
[22:46] strength,
[22:48] right? Of course, that is a part of
[22:50] virtue being moral, not fornicating and
[22:53] so on. Some of us, some of them, he
[22:56] says, don't even believe in the power of
[22:59] God. That's past. Only thing you have to
[23:02] do is just put your name on the book, be
[23:04] sprinkled or poured or baptized or
[23:06] whatever more. That's all you have to
[23:08] do. All right. So, you all with me?
[23:10] Virtue is strength. So, when you look at
[23:14] the seven virtues,
[23:16] not just the second one, there are seven
[23:19] strengths.
[23:23] building materials. Faith is a virtue.
[23:26] Virtue is a virtue.
[23:29] &gt;&gt; Knowledge is a virtue. Temperance is a
[23:30] virtue.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; They're all strengths.
[23:34] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, when we get to virtue, the
[23:38] second virtue,
[23:40] &gt;&gt; then we're going to understand what the
[23:42] mystery of that is.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[23:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you read now, if you go into
[23:47] the Greek there and you you look up what
[23:50] the word there means in the Greek in
[23:53] second Peter and you click on that word
[23:55] virtue or you go to your concordance or
[23:58] something, it comes up with arete which
[24:00] means praise
[24:04] &gt;&gt; or any particular moral excellence you
[24:07] see there at the bottom as modesty. But
[24:10] the actual meaning is praise.
[24:13] Huh? Who would have thought that? Add to
[24:16] your faith praise.
[24:19] And and and this is the issue with our
[24:21] our language, our words. We usually have
[24:25] a very
[24:27] uh if I had to ask every one of us,
[24:30] write down on a page what you think
[24:32] praise means. All of you will have some
[24:35] kind of definition for the word. And
[24:38] most of you are going to look to the
[24:41] shortest, simplest definition.
[24:44] Right? And you're never going to dwell
[24:46] on it to think what does it really mean
[24:48] or how does this unfold or how do I
[24:49] apply this? We always go for the very
[24:53] simplest meaning the least complicated
[24:57] uh meaning of everything right which is
[24:59] a good thing
[25:01] except that when you look when you're
[25:03] now tying in the word virtue with praise
[25:05] how does this really fit in to building
[25:08] materials?
[25:11] So that's the original word in the
[25:13] Bible. Not even strength. Brother man
[25:17] says that virtue means strength. This is
[25:21] to describe the second attribute. So in
[25:23] there when you say when it says add to
[25:26] your faith virtue that is describing the
[25:29] second attribute.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; But brother Baron says they are all
[25:34] virtues.
[25:35] &gt;&gt; They are all strengths. So praise or
[25:39] moral excellence is the second attribute
[25:43] but it itself is a strength.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; Okay. Then we have in the Bible the word
[25:52] strength. Now if you go to the Bible and
[25:54] you look at the word strength, it's the
[25:56] word dunamis in the Greek which means
[25:59] power, might or strength, right? And now
[26:05] seven virtues then means seven
[26:08] strengths. So in other words, if you're
[26:10] a believer
[26:11] and you have these seven strengths for
[26:15] your day, you have something that is
[26:19] giving you ability to do something.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Got it?
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you're never going to get into
[26:28] the position where you are going to do
[26:32] what God has called you until you have
[26:35] all the strengths required to do it.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Now, obviously, these
[26:42] are not the strengths of the body.
[26:45] They're the strengths of the spirit.
[26:47] Yes.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Now if you know all of us can do some
[26:51] exercise, walk, stretch, you know, do I
[26:56] don't know whatever you do, uh, uh, lift
[27:00] some weights or get 10,000 steps in a
[27:03] day or do squats or something to
[27:06] increase muscle strength,
[27:09] right? How do you strengthen the spirit?
[27:14] &gt;&gt; What gym will you go to for that? Yeah.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; Hey, uh I'll tell you something.
[27:21] Intermittent fasting won't strengthen a
[27:23] spirit.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:24] &gt;&gt; There's no intermittent fasting for the
[27:26] spirit.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Um strengthening the spirit is something
[27:31] else.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; It requires something else. People um
[27:37] look at strengthening the spirit with
[27:39] discipline,
[27:40] with abstinence,
[27:42] which is some kind of fasting, with um u
[27:46] methods, with philosophy,
[27:49] with um uh uh mental training, with
[27:53] positive thinking, with um what do you
[27:57] call it? with like um speaking positive
[28:00] words or maybe joining positive people
[28:04] or reading certain books, certain
[28:07] materials.
[28:09] People look to those things um something
[28:12] in psychology or something to strengthen
[28:15] their spirit,
[28:17] to better their mind, to change their
[28:20] thinking. You know what?
[28:23] This is the problem with this. You can't
[28:26] fight your DNA.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; You can only be positive as much as your
[28:32] DNA is going to allow you.
[28:36] If you have it in your genes to be
[28:38] angry, you're going to be angry
[28:41] to be jealous. You're going to be
[28:43] jealous. If you have it in your DNA to
[28:45] be somebody who's impatient, if you're
[28:48] driven by those chemicals and those the
[28:51] background you come from and your race
[28:53] and your parenting and the place you
[28:55] come from, this is who you're going to
[28:57] be. There is nothing in the world that
[29:00] can change your DNA
[29:03] but the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit.
[29:07] There's nothing else that can rewrite
[29:09] that coding
[29:11] &gt;&gt; but the Holy Spirit. Yeah.
[29:13] &gt;&gt; So you can you can uh do all the
[29:16] positive thinking you want in the world.
[29:19] You can do all the the the programs.
[29:21] This is why even you know when you when
[29:23] you listen to people who are alcoholics
[29:26] to them they have this phrase once an
[29:29] alcoholic always an alcoholic. That
[29:31] doesn't happen in the with God.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; To them it's like once an addict always
[29:38] an addict. and they say to you, "I'm I'm
[29:40] I'm a I'm a recovered addict so many
[29:43] years clean or a drug addict so many
[29:45] years clean." When you come to God,
[29:48] there's no such thing as so many years
[29:50] clean. It's done for. I'm not that
[29:53] anymore.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; I'm no longer an addict. He has cleansed
[29:57] me from that. He's taken it out of me. I
[30:00] don't need chips and coins and trophies
[30:03] and that kind of thing. Are you with me?
[30:06] Why? Strengths have been added.
[30:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Beautiful. So these strengths are
[30:14] far superior to the strength of the
[30:17] body. We've often heard this, the spirit
[30:21] is willing and the flesh is weak. The
[30:24] strength of the spirit can actually
[30:27] renew the strength of the body.
[30:32] The strength of the spirit can heal, can
[30:35] mend, can even push the body beyond what
[30:38] you think your limit is.
[30:42] Right now in the current relaxed state
[30:45] that you are in,
[30:47] some of you uh enjoy the sound of my
[30:49] voice and might feel this is a perfect
[30:51] time to doze off to sleep.
[30:56] You know, do you know why people fall
[30:58] asleep in church? It's not because
[31:00] they're disrespectful. It's because
[31:02] their bodies start to relax.
[31:04] You're so highly strong. You're so tense
[31:07] everywhere else. When you sit in a place
[31:09] that is comfortable, it's natural for
[31:11] your body to fall asleep.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; It's actually, you know why you fall
[31:15] asleep? Because you feel safe.
[31:20] Yeah, that's what's happening. You're
[31:22] actually feeling safe. You feel secure,
[31:25] right? For those pe for some people
[31:28] other people come into church and feel
[31:30] terribly insecure like everybody's
[31:33] watching me nervous. But those people
[31:36] who do fall asleep it actually tells me
[31:39] they're very comfortable. I'm so happy
[31:42] you're comfortable but you know
[31:46] please let me speak and listen to me.
[31:50] So no I'm very much aware of that. You
[31:52] know, when you if you if you're somebody
[31:54] like myself, you watch nature, you watch
[31:57] the the characteristics of animals and
[32:00] you wonder why you get a, you know, like
[32:02] a dog that's going to go to a certain
[32:03] place, it walks around and flattens the
[32:06] grass and moves around in a circle
[32:07] before it lies down and just passes out,
[32:10] right? And you see what what it does.
[32:12] And but they will not sleep in an area
[32:15] where they feel insecure.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; You won't find a dog go and pass out in
[32:19] the middle of the street when there's
[32:21] traffic.
[32:22] or right next to the roadside where
[32:24] everything their ears are going to pop
[32:26] up and the every sound and screech
[32:28] they're going to look for a place that
[32:29] is secure. Right? So that's why I'm
[32:32] saying to show you that your your body
[32:36] reacts very much to what your spirit
[32:39] dictates
[32:40] and your your spirit can push the body
[32:43] to limits.
[32:45] So that's where I was starting with. I
[32:47] don't know why I ended up there. I'm
[32:48] sleeping. But
[32:51] right now, you're in a very relaxed
[32:53] state. If anybody had to tell you, GET
[32:56] DOWN ON THE FLOOR RIGHT NOW AND GIVE ME
[32:57] 10. OH my word, you won't even do one
[33:01] because you're so relaxed right now.
[33:03] Your spirit is telling you, my limit is
[33:05] just peace, relaxation.
[33:08] But if I had to bring in a rabbit dog or
[33:13] a lion just walked in,
[33:16] you people would hop over the railings.
[33:20] You would climb through trees. If you
[33:22] never climbed in your life, if you never
[33:24] jumped higher than 6 ft, you will do it.
[33:28] your spirit immediately would change to
[33:30] that uh fightorflight response and
[33:34] you're going to do things you didn't
[33:37] realize your body would do. And believe
[33:40] me, 2 days later, you are going to feel
[33:42] the pain.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; That's what happens because you've
[33:45] overstretched your tendons. You've
[33:47] overworked your muscle. You're going to
[33:50] feel so tense and so tight and so sore.
[33:53] You're going to need anti-inflammatory
[33:54] and painkillers because this is what
[33:57] your spirit can actually do to your
[33:58] body. It can push you. There's strength
[34:02] in there.
[34:04] So when you look at this, so God felt it
[34:08] necessary that we have to have these
[34:11] seven strengths before we should receive
[34:13] the most important one.
[34:16] Right? Can you imagine a church with all
[34:19] those seven virtues in place?
[34:22] that church would be invincible.
[34:25] That that church would have immeasurable
[34:27] strength.
[34:29] Right?
[34:31] I can tell you in in in 25 years, all
[34:34] right, this is my 25th year in the
[34:36] ministry here in Durban,
[34:40] we have never had a church split.
[34:44] Some of you don't realize what a what a
[34:46] great thing that is.
[34:48] We have not once have we had a split in
[34:52] our church based on doctrine. Do you
[34:55] know how many churches have have had
[34:57] that where a whole chunk of families and
[34:59] people just leave and half the they lose
[35:01] half the church. In 25 years we've never
[35:03] had a church split. And yet in 25 years
[35:06] we've never increased our numbers to 500
[35:09] to a,000.
[35:13] And of course when you do that when you
[35:15] increase your numbers to great amounts
[35:16] you are heading for splits because if
[35:19] you if you increase your church to those
[35:21] amounts it means you are pushing certain
[35:24] teachings and not telling your church
[35:25] the whole truth.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; Because if you tell the church the whole
[35:30] truth you will never grow in massive
[35:32] numbers.
[35:36] &gt;&gt; That's just the truth. For you to be
[35:39] able to keep thousands and thousands of
[35:40] people in a church, it means you're
[35:42] compromising
[35:44] on truth.
[35:48] You know, just on the way to church
[35:50] here, my boys were asking, we were
[35:52] talking in the car and asking, they were
[35:54] asking me, "How many message believers
[35:56] do you think there are in the world
[35:57] right now?" And I said, "Probably a
[36:02] a few hundred thousand."
[36:05] And they were shocked. He said, "As
[36:07] little as that?" I said, "Yeah." I said,
[36:10] "If you look at from the time of the
[36:12] prophet to about now, maybe it's like a
[36:16] million
[36:17] counting those that have died. I don't
[36:20] know all the exact numbers, but they
[36:23] said to me, when you think about that,
[36:25] are we are we so few?"
[36:28] And it I said, "Yeah, it's it sounds so
[36:31] surreal when you think about it. like
[36:33] why shouldn't the message be a sweeping
[36:35] movement that takes millions that
[36:37] attracts the attention of so many
[36:38] people? So they were asking like so what
[36:40] is our purpose then?
[36:42] &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to be just the
[36:44] influence to others about what the word
[36:46] is? I said, "Well, in in every
[36:51] age or era, if you think about it, when
[36:53] Christ was here, only 12 followed him,
[36:56] &gt;&gt; and there were only 120 out of how many
[36:59] people at that time?" In the time of
[37:01] Noah, how many were there? In the time
[37:03] of of Jacob or Moses, how many were
[37:06] there? They're always a minority, which
[37:08] is actually telling you that people are
[37:11] naturally going to choose to not follow
[37:14] God.
[37:16] So where do we ever get the idea
[37:19] thinking that in the message we're going
[37:21] to get thousands and thousands and
[37:23] thousands or churches with thousands?
[37:27] I can tell you if you are doing that and
[37:29] you are getting massive numbers, you are
[37:31] not telling the truth
[37:35] because it's not congruent with the rest
[37:37] of the Bible.
[37:39] If you are drawing numbers to yourself,
[37:41] you are skimping on the truth.
[37:47] Why? It's, you know how easy it is to do
[37:49] that to get great numbers of people? Cuz
[37:53] if you tell the truth, it's going to get
[37:56] people to be uncomfortable.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Uh you that's one thing you cannot lie
[38:06] about is the truth is is something that
[38:09] exposes people. And when you expose
[38:13] people, and I don't mean expose people
[38:15] by calling their names. I mean when you
[38:17] expose people in their feelings and
[38:20] their emotions and you make them face
[38:22] what it is that their failures are and
[38:24] their misgivings and their shortcomings,
[38:27] they don't like it. They don't like a
[38:30] Why do you think they hate Christianity?
[38:33] Why do you think the western world, like
[38:35] America, which was founded on
[38:37] Protestantism,
[38:39] &gt;&gt; right now, has a a a culture and a
[38:41] community that is going against
[38:44] Christianity in every single way.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; You've got these people teaching
[38:48] Christianity and yet they have foul
[38:50] words in their mouths.
[38:52] &gt;&gt; They don't even know that it's they
[38:54] think it's cool to swear and to curse
[38:56] and use slang and preach the gospel
[38:58] using those. They they're absolutely
[39:00] unconscious
[39:02] of the Holy Spirit.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; And they're the ones supposed to be
[39:06] teaching Christianity to the rest of the
[39:07] world.
[39:11] And this is where we are right now. But
[39:13] yet they have thousands.
[39:16] Thousands more than we have and we'll
[39:18] ever have. Amen.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; They will have the massive churches, the
[39:23] greatest scientific movements, the mass
[39:26] most massive screens, the best music,
[39:28] the best lights, the best uh finances.
[39:31] They'll have the best of everything and
[39:33] no Holy Spirit,
[39:36] no truth.
[39:38] All right? So, in the scripture, there
[39:41] are times when the word I want to show
[39:43] you what the word strength is, why it
[39:46] relates to virtue or ability. Let's go
[39:48] to Acts chapter 9 22.
[39:52] But Paul increased the more in strength
[39:54] and confounded the Jews
[39:58] which dwelt at Damascus. Now the Jews
[40:00] he's talking about are Jewish believers.
[40:03] Right? He grew more in strength. What
[40:06] strength?
[40:08] Right? It means Paul grew spiritually
[40:11] strong and his ability to teach the word
[40:15] confounded the Jews.
[40:19] You know, this is the thing. What did he
[40:22] confound them with? He confused them.
[40:24] Why did he confuse them? Was he
[40:26] preaching in a confusing way? No. This
[40:30] is another thing. You got people who
[40:32] tell you, "No, brother Alistister,
[40:33] you're not supposed to come here and
[40:34] confuse the people." I didn't confuse
[40:37] the people.
[40:39] I didn't confound them. I just told you
[40:41] the word.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; I didn't preach anything confusing. Why?
[40:45] Why do I know that? Because I can teach
[40:46] the same thing to a child and they get
[40:48] it.
[40:51] What's confusing? You have preconceived
[40:55] ideas of things and systems that you
[40:58] felt worked for you for generations.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; Why you're saying you're confused is
[41:02] because you're not willing to accept the
[41:04] truth I just told you.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; And you're claiming to be confounded.
[41:11] &gt;&gt; But he increased in strength. See,
[41:14] notice when virtue increases,
[41:18] the effects are visible.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Hebrews 11. Oh, where
[41:27] are we? Yeah. Hebrews 11:11. Through
[41:31] faith also Sarah received herself
[41:34] received strength to conceive seed. What
[41:37] happened? Was Sarah weak?
[41:40] Did she was she losing iron or what?
[41:43] What strength?
[41:45] She was barren.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Receiving strength to receive to
[41:50] conceive seed. That means she was
[41:54] healed. Her body had received something.
[41:59] Reset the hormones, the womb, the
[42:01] ovaries, all of that. The pituitary
[42:04] gland, pituitary gland, everything was
[42:06] was reset. Somehow she received strength
[42:09] to conceive seed.
[42:13] Amen. Strength has to do with ability.
[42:17] Are you with us? Let's go to 2
[42:19] Corinthians
[42:20] uh oh where are we? Romans 5-6. 5 and
[42:23] verse 6. When for when we were yet
[42:26] without strength in due time Christ died
[42:31] for the ungodly.
[42:33] Right. When we had no ability of our own
[42:36] to believe or to have faith, Christ died
[42:38] for us. That's a piece of my notes added
[42:41] in. He made a way knowing that we had no
[42:44] virtue in us to save ourselves. That's
[42:46] what it means by when we were without
[42:49] strength. When we had no ability to save
[42:52] ourselves,
[42:54] &gt;&gt; Christ died for the ungodly.
[42:58] Christ died for the who?
[43:01] The ungodly. 2 Corinthians 12:9, "And he
[43:05] said unto me, my grace is sufficient for
[43:07] thee, for my strength is made perfect in
[43:11] weakness."
[43:13] Right? Most gladly, therefore, will I
[43:16] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[43:18] power of Christ may rest upon me. This a
[43:21] very confusing scripture, isn't it? Must
[43:24] glory in my weakness,
[43:27] right? Or uh his strength is made
[43:29] perfect in my in weakness. Therefore,
[43:32] when I am weak, he is strong.
[43:35] What does that mean? I'm going just
[43:36] continue backsliding to show how great
[43:38] he is. That's not at all what it means.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; That's not the weakness it's talking
[43:44] about. The weakness is the inability to
[43:48] save yourself.
[43:51] See, a lot of people say, you know,
[43:53] brother, I have this addiction to
[43:55] smoking. It's my weakness. No, smoking
[43:58] is not your weakness. Your weakness is
[44:01] succumbing to smoking.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Your weakness is the inability to give
[44:06] it up.
[44:10] &gt;&gt; Your weakness is not smoking. Your
[44:12] weakness is not alcohol. Your weakness
[44:14] is not fornication. The weakness is
[44:16] something else.
[44:18] Right? And the weakness is the is the
[44:20] inability to save yourself. The weakness
[44:24] is the inability to say no to something.
[44:28] So that's the weakness. So when you are
[44:30] weak, he is strong.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:33] &gt;&gt; See, when you don't have the ability to
[44:36] stop it.
[44:39] So don't
[44:41] misidentify the weakness. Amen.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; You don't. This is why, you know, when I
[44:46] when I deal with the with the young
[44:48] people and they come to me and they've
[44:50] got issues with sexuality and that when
[44:52] we when we talk about this, they focus
[44:55] on the thing
[44:58] they feel and and this is why they are
[45:00] surprised when they ask you for a
[45:02] solution. What do I do? And then they
[45:04] want the Holy Ghost to take that thing
[45:07] away from them. The Holy Ghost is not
[45:09] going to do that. That thing is going to
[45:11] be there to stay. In fact, the world is
[45:13] going to produce more of it.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is not going to make that
[45:18] disappear. The problem is your self-will
[45:22] &gt;&gt; is weak.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; So, what do we need to strengthen the
[45:27] self-will to say no to it? That's where
[45:31] we need to focus.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Right. My strength is made perfect in
[45:37] him uh or in weakness. So, the strength
[45:40] of God is made perfect. And then again
[45:42] what does it mean made perfect? It means
[45:44] my strength or the strength of the word
[45:48] is shown manifested or made complete
[45:53] through your weakness.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Through your inability
[45:58] my ability can be made made known made
[46:01] manifest. Amen.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[46:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. So his virtue his abilities are
[46:07] made perfect when I show weakness.
[46:10] That's so so when I am at my weakest
[46:12] when the abilities or that I possess
[46:17] are showing weakness it's when the
[46:20] virtues of Christ can be seen right
[46:24] which is one of the reasons why as
[46:26] Christians your
[46:30] your purpose part of your purpose on
[46:32] earth today is to go through the trials
[46:38] Right. A lot of people in the message
[46:41] think today that
[46:44] uh what we have to do for you as a
[46:47] church is protect you
[46:50] is to make sure you come to church.
[46:54] We have to police you. We have to phone
[46:56] you when you don't come to church. We
[46:58] have to make sure you dress a certain
[46:59] way. We have to make sure that you bring
[47:01] up your children that way. we have to um
[47:04] set strong rules to prevent you from uh
[47:08] watching a movie or listening to to
[47:10] worldly music or we must so they feel
[47:15] like that's the job of the church.
[47:17] That's not our job.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Your duty is to actually go through the
[47:24] trial.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; How can we protect you? How young girl,
[47:30] how can we protect you from a boy who's
[47:33] flirting with you?
[47:36] What must we lock you up in a room?
[47:39] Because that's the best. Just make you
[47:41] see four walls. That's going to protect
[47:43] you from a guy who flirts with you or a
[47:45] a boy, young man. We can protect you.
[47:49] Let's say we protect you all the way
[47:50] through school. Lock you up in a room
[47:52] and never let you see anyone. When you
[47:54] get to work, you're dead. Those women
[47:58] out there are they're coyotes.
[48:02] Let me tell you, they're they're wolves.
[48:04] They're foxes.
[48:07] They're every other kind of name you can
[48:09] think of, men and women.
[48:11] They don't care who you they don't care
[48:13] that you're married.
[48:15] They don't care. They don't care that
[48:17] you're you you have an engagement ring
[48:20] on.
[48:22] To them, they love the game. They're
[48:24] going to try you. And if you have a
[48:27] self-will that folds for the prettiest
[48:30] batting eyes,
[48:32] fluttering eyelids,
[48:34] &gt;&gt; and sweetest voice,
[48:36] you're done for.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; And how do you get to that strength? If
[48:43] you didn't meet all the creeps in school
[48:46] and learn to say no to them,
[48:50] &gt;&gt; you're never going to say no to the
[48:52] creeps when you are working with them.
[48:54] Which means you are going to have to
[48:56] have exercised your faith muscles
[49:00] &gt;&gt; while you were growing.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; This is the problem with keeping your
[49:04] children locked away.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; At the same time, young people be
[49:13] saying, "You see, mom, dad, you're
[49:14] locking me away. You're wrong."
[49:19] At the same time, young people, you
[49:22] don't think you have the strength to go
[49:24] out there in the world. If you're not a
[49:26] child who reads your Bible and studies
[49:28] the message and prays to God and makes a
[49:31] commitment when you get out there to
[49:32] think you can exercise your muscles,
[49:36] the word is telling your muscles are
[49:38] weak.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; His muscles are made strong in your
[49:41] weakness. Which means you need to read
[49:44] the word, pray, be a believer, come to
[49:48] church, be interested in the gospel. Uh
[49:51] you are supposed to be taken in the
[49:53] word. Then you can say I can go out
[49:55] there and exercise my faith muscles.
[49:58] Then mom and dad can trust me.
[50:02] If you don't listen, you know,
[50:09] I am one person
[50:12] who grew up in this message. If there's
[50:14] anybody you should hear from, it's me.
[50:17] I'm not saying this with any pride. I am
[50:19] a person who is exactly what the message
[50:23] preached for us to be.
[50:25] I grew up in this world. I didn't go on
[50:27] backslide. I didn't go into the world. I
[50:30] married my first girlfriend.
[50:33] I uh did not drink, did not smoke, did
[50:35] not swear, did not do all that. Dressed
[50:37] right, did everything right in the eyes
[50:39] of the church. And here I am today still
[50:41] serving God's people. If there's anybody
[50:43] who should actually listen to, it is me
[50:47] &gt;&gt; because I am the product of the message.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; My parents were people who grew up in
[50:53] denominations. They dated other people.
[50:55] They may have drank and smoked and swore
[50:58] and did all those. They they did not
[51:00] even live the life they preached for me
[51:02] to live.
[51:05] So they don't even know how it's done.
[51:08] They only have it in theory. I've done
[51:10] it.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[51:13] &gt;&gt; so if you want to know how it's done,
[51:15] I'll tell you how it's done. And it's
[51:17] not done by going to youth camps and and
[51:20] waiting for some supernatural anointing
[51:21] to hit you. It's work.
[51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:26] It's work. Don't shy away from it.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; There's no way you're going out there
[51:31] and be like me where I can be out in the
[51:34] world on college campuses playing sport
[51:37] with other people and keeping my
[51:39] testimony.
[51:41] I just I just showed my my my sons
[51:44] yesterday
[51:45] when I was 21
[51:48] 21 I had drawn a diagram with all the
[51:53] chapters and verses of the book of
[51:55] revelations
[51:56] which I then when I became a pastor I
[51:58] drew it out for our church.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; For us to teach the timeline. Listen
[52:03] young men at 21 I knew the book of
[52:06] Revelations.
[52:08] I knew where the trumpets were, where
[52:10] the vials were. I knew which verse fits
[52:12] with where with every
[52:15] This is what I'm saying. Don't tell me
[52:17] you can you can feel strong enough to go
[52:20] out in the world and think you're just
[52:22] going to do what I did. I put the work
[52:24] in.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Are you putting the work in? You think,
[52:29] "Mom, dad, I want to go to the metric
[52:31] ball. I want to go to the dance. I want
[52:33] to be there." Have you put the work in?
[52:38] Have you studied the message? You tell
[52:40] me you're going to trust yourself and
[52:42] mom and dad must just trust you.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; When you don't put the work in, you
[52:47] don't study the message. You don't read
[52:49] the church ages. You don't get to know
[52:51] God. You don't pray.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; I went through university and college
[52:55] and did exams and never missed a single
[52:57] service.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Whether I was writing on Friday or
[53:02] Monday, I was in church on Sunday.
[53:06] I managed my life so I could study and
[53:08] still pass and still be at church. I
[53:10] made no excuses. I put the work in.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I recognized
[53:20] my strength is his strength.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; I'm never going to defeat the enemy on
[53:25] my own self-will.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; I'm never going to defeat the enemy just
[53:29] because my parents brought me up to be a
[53:31] good boy.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I knew I have to hide the word of
[53:36] God in my heart.
[53:38] &gt;&gt; That's the only way I'm going to keep
[53:40] myself out there.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; I believe that. That's what works for me
[53:45] till this day. That's what makes me
[53:47] grumpy
[53:50] &gt;&gt; with the world.
[53:52] No matter how much of fun I can have
[53:54] with my children, they just know in my
[53:56] face when something is too liberal.
[53:58] They can see it in my face when
[54:01] something they're doing or something is
[54:02] happening and it's too liberal. They can
[54:04] see it on me because it's never going to
[54:06] agree WITH ME. AND IT'S NOT AGREEING
[54:07] WITH ME. IT'S NOT AGREEING WITH
[54:09] SOMETHING INSIDE ME that I have put
[54:11] inside me.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; It's not my strength. It's his strength.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; That's what works. There's no excuses.
[54:20] I'm not preaching youth meetings and
[54:22] having stuff with you guys here just to
[54:25] make you feel good. Oh, don't worry. We
[54:27] understand what you're going through.
[54:29] No, I'm sorry. When you get to 22, 23,
[54:31] 24 and it's time to get married, you
[54:34] need strength. Where did you get it
[54:35] from? Did you put in the work?
[54:40] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say go to a Holy Ghost
[54:42] meeting and he'll add to your faith. It
[54:45] says you add to your faith.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; YOU ADD TO YOUR VIRTUE. YOU ADD TO YOUR
[54:50] KNOWLEDGE. YOU ADD TO YOUR TEMPERANCE.
[54:54] Don't wait for the Holy Ghost TO DO
[54:56] SOMETHING LIKE SOMETHING SWITCH IS GOING
[54:58] TO HAPPEN AND then suddenly it pours in.
[55:00] You are not going to get knowledge
[55:02] unless you study.
[55:14] I remember when the message came in and
[55:16] our parents, my mom was reading the
[55:18] message. My mom is like what? She's like
[55:21] 70 years old. She listens to at least
[55:23] three messages a day.
[55:26] At least
[55:28] to this day, she's 70 years old. She
[55:30] might even pass out halfway through
[55:32] something. I don't know.
[55:35] But if she's working in the house, she
[55:37] will listen to a message.
[55:41] And it doesn't mean she's the sweetest
[55:43] person in the world. If you meet her on
[55:44] a bad day, she'll chip you out really
[55:46] bad.
[55:49] But she's listening to the message. No
[55:51] matter what I know, no matter what, she
[55:54] will never stop loving the word. Right.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; During my growing up days, if my mom was
[56:02] working in the house, she would be
[56:04] singing a song, a Christian song, a
[56:07] beautiful hymn, and at the same time, in
[56:09] one second, turn around and shout at me
[56:11] like, "Where did the anointing go?" And
[56:13] then after she's done shouting at me,
[56:15] she's back to singing a song.
[56:19] Right?
[56:21] But my point is all the saints put in
[56:25] the work
[56:27] &gt;&gt; and they are strengths. You have to go
[56:30] out and get them.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's no excuses. Are you with
[56:34] me?
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Re these are not in my notes. I don't
[56:37] even know why I'm saying all this.
[56:38] Revelations 3:8.
[56:40] I know thy works. Behold, I have set
[56:43] before thee an open door and no man can
[56:45] shut it. For thou hast a little strength
[56:46] and has kept my word. Okay. a little
[56:49] strength and has kept my word. The word
[56:51] strength in this scripture in the Greek
[56:54] is dunamis which is the same as virtue.
[56:58] The word little thou has a little
[57:01] strength means a measure or quantity of
[57:04] a certain or particular virtue. In other
[57:07] words, the trials of this is the church
[57:09] age of Philadelphia. These believers had
[57:11] the right amount of a certain virtue to
[57:13] keep the word for their day. So it was
[57:16] in every age. It was not that each age
[57:19] had a great amount of virtue than the
[57:21] previous. It was not that each age had
[57:23] all the previous ages virtues as well.
[57:27] Meaning it doesn't mean that
[57:28] Philadelphia possessed all the virtues
[57:31] of the previous age. Right? They had a
[57:34] little virtue was a new material
[57:39] being laid upon the other. And the elect
[57:42] of each age received the virtue by faith
[57:44] in the message of their day. Right?
[57:47] Which helped them overcome the challenge
[57:49] of their day.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; So this virtue or strength was added
[57:55] through the church. This is so
[57:57] beautiful. And I I wish you could
[57:59] understand this.
[58:02] If you knew a little bit about biology,
[58:06] you would know that it takes a lot of
[58:09] things in life that literally adds
[58:12] something to the DNA of a person.
[58:16] It's like intelligence gets coded into
[58:18] it,
[58:20] &gt;&gt; right? So like for example,
[58:24] uh there's a lot of things you do today
[58:26] that occurred because thousands of years
[58:28] ago your ancestors
[58:31] did things like they learned about
[58:34] dangers. They learned how to cook using
[58:38] certain materials. They learned how to
[58:39] use stone. Like nowadays, you will you
[58:43] you become a a 2-year-old. You're born,
[58:46] you're 2 years old, and you're doing
[58:47] something. You don't know why you're
[58:50] doing it, but it it happened 4,000 years
[58:52] ago in your ancestors.
[58:55] &gt;&gt; And you may not know, but you're looking
[58:57] at something and it's a bug and you know
[58:59] not to eat it. You don't know why, but
[59:01] back then it was encoded by some
[59:04] behavioral change into your DNA. And in
[59:07] you right there, the spirits of your
[59:10] forefathers are speaking to you through
[59:12] your DNA and telling you, "Do not eat
[59:14] that. It's poison."
[59:16] &gt;&gt; You recognize it.
[59:19] Why am I saying this? Because you had a
[59:22] bunch of heathens, Gentiles, pagans,
[59:24] idol worshippers, and through the church
[59:27] ages, through the gospel,
[59:29] &gt;&gt; virtues were being installed.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:33] literally into the DNA, which is why the
[59:36] people of this world went from 4,000
[59:38] years of absolute mayhem, and here comes
[59:41] this man who dies on the cross, rose
[59:43] again. A legend was written about, some
[59:46] people say he didn't even exist. Some
[59:47] people said he wasn't even crucified.
[59:49] But for a guy who didn't exist or wasn't
[59:51] crucified to change the whole world in
[59:53] under 2,000 years did a great job
[59:57] &gt;&gt; changing wild fighting violent nations
[1:00:02] into peaceful people who want
[1:00:04] democracies
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; and constitutions written on moral
[1:00:08] values and people's rights and all of
[1:00:10] that. Where did they think they got that
[1:00:12] from?
[1:00:13] And now it's literally encoded into that
[1:00:15] DNA.
[1:00:18] Right? Through study of the church ages,
[1:00:21] we can see that each virtue in each age
[1:00:24] came into the church through each
[1:00:26] messengers's message. Now, I love it
[1:00:29] because if you read the book of
[1:00:30] Revelations, it tells you about the
[1:00:32] sevenfold glory of his person. Sevenfold
[1:00:36] attributes. You can tie it all in. Like
[1:00:39] for example, his hair is white as wool.
[1:00:42] His eyes is a flame of fire. His feet is
[1:00:44] fine brass. His voice is the sound of
[1:00:47] many waters.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; All attributes and you can find them.
[1:00:51] They are the divine attributes of the
[1:00:53] capstone.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Which we will get to some other
[1:00:58] time.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; As the last age ended, the new one
[1:01:02] began. And the first thing that happened
[1:01:04] is God allowed a certain spirit of the
[1:01:07] enemy to rise up in the church which
[1:01:09] required a virtue of God to be unveiled.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; To counter that.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Right. So when the people learned what
[1:01:19] it took to counter that, it now become
[1:01:21] recorded in them.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; And they knew how if this came up again,
[1:01:25] they knew how to deal with that.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; And so it was passed down. See, that's
[1:01:29] how they were building blocks.
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. of the church.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; So at the last age now the same thing
[1:01:37] happened. The new age began and we
[1:01:40] learned from the from the mistakes. We
[1:01:42] saw the spirit that challenged it,
[1:01:44] right? And God allowed that spirit of
[1:01:46] the enemy to come in so the people could
[1:01:49] experience it.
[1:01:51] This the thing you have to experience
[1:01:53] it.
[1:01:55] So we're not against we're not against
[1:01:58] people disagreeing with us. We have to
[1:02:01] experience that.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; We're not against people calling us
[1:02:04] names. We're not against people sledging
[1:02:06] us or you know uh coming against us or
[1:02:10] calling us cult. We have to go through
[1:02:12] that.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; We have to face it and we have to
[1:02:16] overcome that and we need a certain
[1:02:17] character. What's the right thing to do?
[1:02:21] Like you've got people on the internet
[1:02:23] going against the prophet. What's the
[1:02:24] right thing to do? Do we create another
[1:02:27] uh system to fight back against them?
[1:02:30] Some people might think that's the right
[1:02:32] thing to do. Do do we do nothing about
[1:02:35] it and just say, "Well, let's just
[1:02:38] forget about them. Let's just continue
[1:02:39] as normal.
[1:02:41] What's the right thing to do? What's the
[1:02:43] right spirit? What's the right strength
[1:02:46] at this time?
[1:02:48] It has to be seen somewhere."
[1:02:51] Amen. So then just when it seems like
[1:02:54] when when all is lost and the age is
[1:02:57] suffering with the spirit of the enemy
[1:02:59] that's rising, God sends a messenger and
[1:03:02] a messenger comes with a message that
[1:03:04] breaks open something to show the
[1:03:06] correct strength against that and the
[1:03:09] people accept it and they destroy it.
[1:03:11] They overcome it. Right? So it was
[1:03:14] important however to to bring out each
[1:03:17] virtue in those seen angels so that the
[1:03:19] maturity of the church would be at its
[1:03:22] fullness to receive the virtue of God
[1:03:24] himself at the end which is divine love.
[1:03:27] Let's go to blasphemous names. Then when
[1:03:30] we have met these qualifications and
[1:03:32] become full of the virtues of God and
[1:03:34] the things of God then the Holy Spirit
[1:03:36] comes down and seals us into the
[1:03:38] kingdom. Don't worry now everybody will
[1:03:40] know you got it. I love that.
[1:03:43] Everybody will know you've got it. You
[1:03:45] won't have to say, "Well, glory to God.
[1:03:47] I know I got it. I spoke with tongues.
[1:03:49] Glory to God. I know I got it. I danced
[1:03:50] the spirit once." You don't have to say
[1:03:52] a word about it. Everybody will know you
[1:03:56] got it. Don't you worry. It will testify
[1:04:00] for itself. He'll let it be known among
[1:04:03] men. How will everybody know you got it?
[1:04:06] Hm.
[1:04:08] Because they know what the challenge of
[1:04:10] the hour is and they can see you are
[1:04:12] defeating it.
[1:04:14] See when you add uh virtue, strength or
[1:04:17] power for your age, it produces the
[1:04:20] right character.
[1:04:22] The strength and ability that people
[1:04:24] gain from the messenger's word was
[1:04:26] unmistakable.
[1:04:28] Like uh I I'll show it to you this way.
[1:04:31] Let's take the dark ages, right? the
[1:04:33] thousand years of dark ages when they
[1:04:35] were rounding up the Christians, putting
[1:04:37] them in the circus of Rome and letting
[1:04:39] the lions and bears eat them and these
[1:04:41] people instead of fighting back just
[1:04:43] stood there and praised God. Do you know
[1:04:46] what the circus of Rome was about?
[1:04:47] Entertainment.
[1:04:49] &gt;&gt; People wanted to see these people crying
[1:04:51] and running and screaming and please
[1:04:54] HELP MERCY AND CRY FOR MERCY AND Caesar
[1:04:56] would stand up. Should we give them
[1:04:58] mercy?
[1:05:00] And the people will go no
[1:05:03] that's what they love they love this
[1:05:05] blood and gore and nonsense
[1:05:08] they enjoy this and then the people some
[1:05:11] people will feel sorry and see should we
[1:05:13] give them mercy and THE PEOPLE SAY YES
[1:05:16] that's what this whole thing was about
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; you know what the believers did totally
[1:05:22] spoiled their fun the believers just
[1:05:24] stood there didn't ask for mercy they
[1:05:26] just started singing and praising God
[1:05:28] they were killed by the animals and
[1:05:30] gladiators. They wouldn't even pick up
[1:05:32] the swords to fight. They just stood
[1:05:33] there and said, "We give our lives
[1:05:35] freely."
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine? This was so
[1:05:39] unentertaining.
[1:05:41] The people standing there, I want my
[1:05:43] money back.
[1:05:46] Right? This this is not WE WHAT WE PAID
[1:05:48] FOR. THESE PEOPLE ARE JUST DYING
[1:05:50] WILLFULLY. WHAT'S WHAT'S UP WITH THEM?
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; This was the Ox age anointing
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; meeting the challenge of the day. Don't
[1:05:57] play for them.
[1:06:01] Incredible. That's just one way, right?
[1:06:05] History recorded it. The people saw it
[1:06:07] and the enemy was always defeated.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; So the enemy had to come up with a way
[1:06:13] now to combat that. Say this is not
[1:06:17] working. You know what was happening in
[1:06:19] those circuses of Rome? The people in
[1:06:21] the stands started being converted by
[1:06:23] these people
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; and this was backfiring on the Roman
[1:06:28] government. Amen.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Then they decided, "No, this is not
[1:06:30] working. We got to deal with them
[1:06:32] outside. They are converting thousands
[1:06:33] of people here. This isn't right."
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Would you have thought that's the right
[1:06:39] strength?
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; I mean, right there you got this
[1:06:43] ferocious starved lion racing at you to
[1:06:46] eat you. In that moment, do you think,
[1:06:48] "Wow, I need to exercise my moral
[1:06:50] vessel. Let's do a bit of meditation
[1:06:51] right here.
[1:06:54] Let him eat me."
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Never. You will never come up with that
[1:07:00] on your own. In that moment of weakness,
[1:07:02] it's going to be his strength.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. It'll testify for itself.
[1:07:10] He'll let it be known among men. You
[1:07:12] don't have to brag about it. You don't
[1:07:14] have to say this happened to ME ON THIS
[1:07:15] DATE. I WAS WEARING THIS CLOTHES and
[1:07:17] this COLORED TIE AND HE HIT ME LIKE A
[1:07:19] LIGHTNING BOLT AND I SPOKE WITH TONGUES.
[1:07:24] You better keep that testimony forever,
[1:07:26] my friend, cuz you make that testimony
[1:07:29] and you're going to have to make it
[1:07:30] last.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:07:35] So the seven virtues saints are seven
[1:07:39] strengths or abilities that can build
[1:07:42] back the divine nature of man to what he
[1:07:45] once possessed in the garden of Eden.
[1:07:48] All right, I'm closing.
[1:07:50] Uh so this is what I want to draw you to
[1:07:54] right now.
[1:07:56] When people look at these seven virtues
[1:07:57] and this is why I'm I want to show you
[1:07:59] in closing conclude this this out is
[1:08:03] that people who thought that this is the
[1:08:05] seven thunders and these were seven
[1:08:07] mysteries seven so mysterious things
[1:08:10] faith virtue knowledge temp they're so
[1:08:12] mysterious they had to be spoken by the
[1:08:14] thunders and why it's wrong is because
[1:08:18] these are not natures of God
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; they are the original natures of man.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; That was corrupted and have to be
[1:08:29] restored before the capstone descends on
[1:08:32] you.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, had there been no sin,
[1:08:37] you would have possessed them
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; in whatever was necessary.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Right? So, what is faith? This isn't the
[1:08:45] faith of God that framed the worlds.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Everybody has faith.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Yes. You know some of you people with
[1:08:53] anxiety you also have faith maybe a
[1:08:56] little
[1:08:57] but you have some
[1:09:00] right you trust in your anxiousness.
[1:09:04] You have faith in your anxiety to keep
[1:09:06] you safe.
[1:09:08] That's still faith. Faith is is a is
[1:09:11] something that men have men and women
[1:09:13] have to make them believe in something
[1:09:15] without evidence.
[1:09:18] All of you do that. All of you use that.
[1:09:20] All of you exercise that. Am I right?
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; And it's in everything you do, you
[1:09:28] exercise a little bit of faith. Not one
[1:09:30] of you will say to me, "Well, I was sick
[1:09:33] and there was this cough mixture and I
[1:09:35] spent a whole year studying it before I
[1:09:38] bought it."
[1:09:42] Nobody. You will hear, you will call a
[1:09:44] friend, you will call a relative, you
[1:09:46] will listen to the doctor, you hear what
[1:09:47] the doctor says. You will even make the
[1:09:50] stupid decision based on how the doctor
[1:09:52] smiled.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; And the doctor said, "Don't worry. Trust
[1:09:56] me. I've been a doctor for 50 years.
[1:09:58] This works." And you'll be like looking
[1:10:00] at your husband 50 years. He must know
[1:10:03] what he's talking about.
[1:10:06] Let's buy it based on that.
[1:10:09] Oh, this one or I saw this on YouTube. I
[1:10:11] saw this on Tik Tok or that or that.
[1:10:14] Please do not tell me you've done due
[1:10:16] diligence and done all the
[1:10:18] investigations necessary. At some point
[1:10:20] your investigations ran out and you took
[1:10:22] it by faith,
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; right? Everybody, every human acts
[1:10:30] majority of the time on faith
[1:10:32] &gt;&gt; because nobody has the time to go find
[1:10:34] all the evidence.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not faith, it's just
[1:10:40] hoping.
[1:10:42] Let's take it and hope it works. Right?
[1:10:46] The point is there are natures of man
[1:10:48] that has been corrupted.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:10:51] &gt;&gt; Even faith itself is corrupted
[1:10:55] because faith in the wrong thing is
[1:10:57] corrupt faith.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Like people who will actually trust in a
[1:11:02] lie and stake their claim on a lie.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; They have had corrupted faith. They were
[1:11:09] unable to see through the lie and
[1:11:12] recognize that they need to to change
[1:11:14] their idea about this. Right? So all
[1:11:17] those attributes they are attributes of
[1:11:19] man.
[1:11:21] Virtue is an attribute of man. Knowledge
[1:11:23] is an attribute of man. Temperance is an
[1:11:25] attribute of man.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Why does God need temperance?
[1:11:30] Temperance is self-control.
[1:11:34] Why is that a godly attribute?
[1:11:36] Self-control. Does God ever need
[1:11:38] self-control?
[1:11:40] Does God ever need patience?
[1:11:44] H
[1:11:46] Does God need to exercise patience? Come
[1:11:48] on, people. Is time affecting God? Oh, I
[1:11:52] need to endure.
[1:11:54] Does God need to endure?
[1:11:57] How about godliness? Does God need
[1:11:59] godliness?
[1:12:02] Huh? This is a this is the thing. So
[1:12:04] when we say they are attributes of the
[1:12:06] Holy Spirit or something like that, THE
[1:12:08] HOLY SPIRIT AGAIN IS SOMETHING RELATED
[1:12:10] to man.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; See, so first before we get to the
[1:12:17] actual divine attribute meant to cap
[1:12:21] mankind, you have to have all those
[1:12:24] other attributes restored to its
[1:12:27] original.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; That's what the building blocks are
[1:12:31] about. We've got to have true faith in
[1:12:35] the right thing. How could you have
[1:12:38] faith unless Christ was born, died, and
[1:12:42] rose again? How could you have faith
[1:12:45] toward true righteousness unless God
[1:12:48] became a man and showed you what true
[1:12:50] faith is?
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; How could you have faith in a word
[1:12:53] unless that word was tested?
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So, here's what
[1:12:59] happened. In the garden of Eden, man was
[1:13:02] once divine
[1:13:04] in the flesh. He was divine. He had the
[1:13:08] nature that was fit to rule.
[1:13:12] This is important to understand which
[1:13:14] will tell us why they are not the seven
[1:13:17] thunders. They are divine human natures,
[1:13:21] not the celestial nature of God. Trust
[1:13:25] me, when we get through each one, like
[1:13:26] brother said, we'll take faith, virtue,
[1:13:28] knowledge, temperance, patience. We'll
[1:13:29] get through each one. We'll study it out
[1:13:31] and then you can decide and tell me
[1:13:33] whether this is like a nature of God.
[1:13:36] Can you if he says add to your faith,
[1:13:39] everyone starts there faith, right? When
[1:13:43] you start off, do you have the faith of
[1:13:45] God that framed the worlds?
[1:13:48] Do you? And at what point do you get it
[1:13:51] and then add to your faith virtue?
[1:13:56] None of us ever have the faith to create
[1:13:58] a planet.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; So that's not the faith you're looking
[1:14:03] to.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; I mean, you're barely struggling to have
[1:14:07] faith to create an outbuilding at the
[1:14:09] back of your house
[1:14:11] or a dog kennel
[1:14:13] nailed up perfectly at 90° angles or
[1:14:17] some kind of thing that you're creating
[1:14:19] at home. Not enough faith. Is that
[1:14:22] right? You know, I tell my kids Poor
[1:14:26] human society, I tell you. We got to We
[1:14:28] constantly have to reward ourselves with
[1:14:29] food, you know. Uh here I I bought the
[1:14:33] kennel, honey. I'm going to build a
[1:14:35] kennel because I bought it. I need to
[1:14:38] reward myself with food. Let's go have
[1:14:41] some cheesecake, you know? Then I get
[1:14:43] through like quarter of it. Look how
[1:14:45] well I did. Let's have some more
[1:14:46] cheesecake
[1:14:49] cuz I'm doing so well. Rewarding myself,
[1:14:51] giving myself some dopamine. Then I I
[1:14:55] finished the thing, but it's slightly
[1:14:56] skewed. Don't worry, honey. We still
[1:14:57] tried. Let's go have some cheesecake.
[1:15:02] Hey, we got to reward ourselves. No
[1:15:04] matter how good or bad we do,
[1:15:07] no matter what or how how things go, we
[1:15:10] must still reward ourselves. This is
[1:15:12] human nature. It's all messed up, right?
[1:15:16] This is important, saints. They are
[1:15:18] divine natures of human beings. God
[1:15:22] doesn't need godliness, patience or
[1:15:24] temperance.
[1:15:26] He is perfect.
[1:15:28] He is not part of time.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; He does not have to endure anything. He
[1:15:34] does not need to exercise patient. If if
[1:15:37] God became impatient with us, there's
[1:15:39] something wrong with him. Cuz how could
[1:15:41] he be impatient when he already knows we
[1:15:44] were going to do that?
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; He's he's got four knowledge. So how can
[1:15:49] he have impatience?
[1:15:51] True.
[1:15:53] His endurance with us is not about his
[1:15:56] endurance. It's about our It's about his
[1:15:59] longsuffering because we are so
[1:16:01] complacent.
[1:16:04] Right? God respects your choice. As a
[1:16:08] church, we are only safe and ready to
[1:16:11] completely destroy the enemy in the
[1:16:13] presence of our husband, Christ. In
[1:16:16] Eden, the woman fell in the absence of
[1:16:18] her capstone. Amen.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; She fell in the absence of her husband.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; So if you don't if you don't even get
[1:16:28] capped with that capstone, all that you
[1:16:31] built up, you will still fall by.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; That's how we know it's not the seven
[1:16:36] thunders.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Perfect.
[1:16:39] &gt;&gt; Because she had everything. She even had
[1:16:42] contact with the theophony. BUT IN THE
[1:16:44] ABSENCE OF HER HUSBAND, she was wooed by
[1:16:47] a different capstone that corrupted
[1:16:49] whatever nature she had and took it out,
[1:16:52] stripped it away from her.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Which is why though you are built up by
[1:16:57] all the word of the messengers, the Holy
[1:17:00] Spirit has to seal that in and the
[1:17:02] capstone come on to perfect it. And now
[1:17:04] it's sealed in place.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; That's why we are living in the day when
[1:17:10] the capstone has to descend. That's what
[1:17:11] the seven seal must do. Yes,
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; it must become something personal to you
[1:17:16] that brings the capsule down, connects
[1:17:17] you to your husband. When he is present,
[1:17:21] then the virtue of God himself is
[1:17:24] produced in us. Divine agape love. But
[1:17:27] it is important that we go through the
[1:17:29] entire building process. Saints,
[1:17:33] to close us off, you couldn't have come
[1:17:36] out of Egypt, crossed over the Red Sea,
[1:17:38] and start having a revival that you were
[1:17:40] in the promised land. Yeah,
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; you couldn't. You had to walk through
[1:17:44] the wilderness journey. You had to meet
[1:17:46] every step. You had to meet Kora Day.
[1:17:49] You had to meet uh the the waters of
[1:17:51] Mara. You had to go through the the
[1:17:53] quailes issue. You had to go through all
[1:17:55] the trials before you get to the place
[1:17:57] where you get into the promised land.
[1:17:59] You can't stop there and say now I'm
[1:18:01] ready for the seventh seal to be open.
[1:18:03] That's why it's not even a global
[1:18:04] instantaneous happening. Each one of us
[1:18:07] are going through our steps,
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; our own personal growth.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; And at that time, YOU CAN BE SITTING in
[1:18:15] the same church under our ministry. And
[1:18:17] I was preaching the seven seal 20 years
[1:18:19] ago. It doesn't mean because I preached
[1:18:21] it 20 years ago, you've got it.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; You still have to come through your
[1:18:26] personal growth UNTIL THAT WHICH I
[1:18:28] PREACHED 20 YEARS AGO becomes a reality
[1:18:30] to you.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not bringing messages to
[1:18:34] tell you you're you're slowing us down.
[1:18:36] You're not worth it. You're getting into
[1:18:38] slow. You're not getting into No. If we
[1:18:40] preach like that, it means we don't even
[1:18:42] understand what we're preaching.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Everybody is growing according to how
[1:18:48] God is revealing himself to them.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; You don't ever have to worry about being
[1:18:52] behind someone or you only came into the
[1:18:55] message a few years ago. Trust me, we're
[1:18:57] not going anywhere without you.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a beautiful part of this
[1:19:02] thing. I I often hear brothers, you
[1:19:04] know, tell me, wonderful, sincere
[1:19:06] brothers, ministers saying, you know,
[1:19:09] brother, how do we catch up? I don't
[1:19:12] even think of you having to catch up.
[1:19:15] What do what do you have to catch up
[1:19:16] with? How much we know how we can teach
[1:19:19] something? All you have to do is listen,
[1:19:22] believe, and trust God.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT AND ACT on it.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:29] You don't have to do anything. It'll
[1:19:32] testify for itself.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; He'll let it be known among men. Just
[1:19:36] let it become real to you. Listen to the
[1:19:39] word, believe it, and act on it.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; I think that's where the church fails. I
[1:19:45] I've actually got quotes that I've,
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; you know, going to Brother Maron says,
[1:19:48] "People believe." I think we read some
[1:19:50] of it on on Wednesday. People believe
[1:19:53] and stop there. Yeah,
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; that's the issue right now with the
[1:19:57] right now with message churches. That's
[1:19:59] the issue because we preach the word, we
[1:20:01] take you to camps, you get the Holy
[1:20:03] Ghost, and then we bring you to church
[1:20:05] and and you do nothing.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; You're never meant to do nothing.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; You have to act on the word
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; because that is going to produce the
[1:20:14] virtue. The virtue that's going to lead
[1:20:16] you to the building blocks that builds
[1:20:18] you up to become that holy temple which
[1:20:21] he can cap. These are seven steps to
[1:20:23] perfection. Then he seals everything
[1:20:25] with the Holy Ghost at the end and
[1:20:27] brings his own divine nature, celestial
[1:20:31] heavenly divine nature which is the
[1:20:32] capstone to come down upon. Praise be to
[1:20:35] God. Let's bow our heads together. Amen.
