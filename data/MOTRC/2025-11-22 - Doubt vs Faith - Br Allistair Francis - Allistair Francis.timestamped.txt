[0:01] So we are coming to a very important
[0:03] part of our faith. There's nothing else
[0:07] that can be the foundation of the temple
[0:09] of God. My point is knowledge cannot be
[0:13] a foundation.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; Love cannot be a foundation.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; Brotherly kindness, not even virtue.
[0:23] Yes.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; Listen, a holy life lived according to
[0:28] the standards of the message cannot be a
[0:30] firm foundation.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; It will fail you.
[0:36] There is nothing else that can be a
[0:38] foundation for a perfect man.
[0:43] It has to be faith. Right? Now, we need
[0:46] to find that. So, there are basically
[0:49] five senses of the body, right? See,
[0:52] smell, taste, hear, touch. Agreed?
[0:56] Basically five senses. And then there
[0:58] are five basic senses of the spirit. But
[1:02] there are only two senses in the soul,
[1:06] &gt;&gt; right? And that's either faith or doubt.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; So you you can have only one of the two.
[1:16] If in or let me say this way, you should
[1:18] have only one of the two which is faith.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; The soul was made for faith.
[1:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Right? So that's where we we're coming
[1:26] to the second half of our teaching.
[1:30] Notice Jesus question, right? Uh
[1:34] uh
[1:36] Jesus question concerning faith or
[1:39] doubt. Uh how does this faith work then?
[1:44] Right? Do you doubt because you have
[1:46] little faith? Because he said, "Oh thou
[1:49] of little faith, wherefore did thou
[1:51] doubt?"
[1:54] So his question is, why did you doubt?
[1:57] &gt;&gt; What was the reason for you having
[1:59] doubt? You saw me? Don't you believe in
[2:02] me? Why did you doubt? So how does this
[2:06] work? Right? Do you doubt because you
[2:08] have little faith or do you have little
[2:10] faith because you doubt?
[2:14] Are you understanding my question? All
[2:17] right. So, we are going to do this
[2:19] through the entire teaching till we
[2:22] reach the top. We're going to take many
[2:24] months to get through this. Right?
[2:27] But the basic understanding is the
[2:31] growth of a child to manhood.
[2:35] From infancy to manhood, from infancy to
[2:38] maturity. Are you with me? Now when a
[2:42] baby is born
[2:45] there is zero doubt in him.
[2:50] Zero doubt. Okay. He has no doubt in him
[2:54] whatsoever. He only has faith
[2:59] and he has zero ability.
[3:02] He cannot walk. He cannot crawl. He
[3:06] cannot feed himself.
[3:08] He cannot roll over. He cannot pick his
[3:11] head up.
[3:13] He has zero doubt and zero ability. Can
[3:16] you imagine being that kind of person?
[3:18] That's how you start it off. Zero doubt,
[3:22] zero ability. Okay. So the first thing
[3:25] if you know a baby, the first thing in
[3:27] his development now obviously
[3:31] it would be wrong if a baby came out of
[3:33] the womb and started running around
[3:34] everywhere
[3:36] DOING EVERYTHING, GRABBING THIS,
[3:38] GRABBING. CAN YOU IMAGINE just being
[3:39] born in the first day, jump off the
[3:41] hospital bed, run around talking to the
[3:43] doctors, the nurses, teasing them,
[3:45] stealing stuff, running? That'll be
[3:48] crazy that you look at this and think
[3:50] this thing is possessed. Put it back.
[3:54] Right. That's wrong. You just can't do
[3:56] that. The baby is born with zero doubt,
[4:00] zero ability.
[4:02] Now uh for and then the first thing when
[4:06] he develops the okay so let me give you
[4:09] a little bit of science. So the baby
[4:12] starts to drink milk from the mother
[4:14] within the first week it has to rise in
[4:18] weight by half a kg 500 g. Agreed? If
[4:22] you go to clinics you go every every
[4:24] sort of 7 days and you weigh the baby.
[4:27] They check the height. They check all
[4:29] the parameters or all whatever it is and
[4:32] the the weight and they checking that
[4:33] the baby is literally gaining half a kg
[4:36] every week. That's a healthy baby.
[4:40] Why? What is happening? Whatever he's
[4:43] drinking is starting to give him
[4:44] ability.
[4:46] Within the first 3 weeks, you see him
[4:48] start to lift his neck.
[4:50] Like you can leave him on his back. When
[4:52] they're born, you leave them on their
[4:54] back, they can't move. They're so zero
[4:56] inability. they can die from their head
[4:59] being stuck in a in a mattress and they
[5:02] can't breathe. So that's why you got to
[5:04] take care of them and then they start
[5:06] getting ability to lift the neck because
[5:09] the food they're taking in is giving
[5:12] strength to the muscles
[5:15] which is the next step we come to is
[5:17] virtue which is ability.
[5:21] You'll see it right now. Let's move on.
[5:25] So this baby all he has is when he opens
[5:28] his eyes the doctors know this because
[5:30] this is scientific as well put the baby
[5:32] in the mother's arms and the child has
[5:34] to lock eyes with the baby I mean the
[5:37] the child has to lock eyes with the
[5:39] mother the mother lock eyes with the
[5:40] baby immediately the child recognizes
[5:43] the mother immediately faith
[5:46] this is mom he doesn't even know what's
[5:48] mom he doesn't know mother he doesn't
[5:50] know English he doesn't know zulu or any
[5:52] language he just locks eyes and knows
[5:55] This is you. I know you. I believe in
[5:58] you. And a smile opens up.
[6:04] Like the baby doesn't look at mom and
[6:05] you if if you ever witness it, it's the
[6:07] most amazing thing. The baby opens his
[6:09] eyes like struggling to open his eyes
[6:11] like this. And when he locks eyes with
[6:13] mom, you just see this smile,
[6:16] this alien looking smile,
[6:20] right? squashed up face like a prune and
[6:23] then smile and then this gurgle like
[6:25] it's so beautiful to watch, right? But
[6:29] um uh at that moment there's only faith.
[6:34] There's no doubt. This child is not
[6:36] going to open its eyes and and go,
[6:38] "Whoa, WHO ARE YOU? WHAT ARE YOU DOING
[6:40] HERE?"
[6:42] There's no doubt. There's no reason to
[6:44] question. This child knows. I know you.
[6:48] You're taking care of me. You're the one
[6:50] I believe in. That's how it begins. It's
[6:54] faith.
[6:57] And what does he do from there? He got
[6:58] no speech. He can't talk. He can't
[7:01] articulate. He just says,
[7:06] and mom says, "Okay, he needs food." The
[7:09] next time he goes, and then mom says his
[7:12] nappy needs to be changed. He just cry.
[7:15] He just cries and things get done for
[7:17] him.
[7:20] That's faith.
[7:22] Zero ability, zero doubt. Just cry out
[7:25] to your heavenly father and things get
[7:26] done
[7:28] because he knows you're weak.
[7:30] &gt;&gt; You have no ability. All you got to have
[7:33] is faith, right? And then at first when
[7:37] they're little infants, everybody
[7:39] carries them. Is that right? The uncle,
[7:42] the aunt comes home. Can I carry him?
[7:43] Can I feed him? And yeah, he doesn't
[7:45] care. They stand, they hold him. They
[7:47] give him a bottle. They feed him. They
[7:49] change his nappy. He's letting them do
[7:50] everything. No problem.
[7:54] Within a few months, his eyes have
[7:56] recognized your mom, your dad. You I
[8:00] don't know. You I don't know. You smell
[8:02] funny. You smell funnier. You I don't
[8:05] like. What is that? That's knowledge
[8:07] coming in. Right. He started to
[8:09] recognize things. He started to
[8:11] recognize people. He knows his room. He
[8:14] knows the smells. That's and the moment
[8:17] knowledge starts coming in is when doubt
[8:20] starts coming in
[8:23] because now some that same uncle comes
[8:26] to pick him up and he says I don't want
[8:28] you
[8:31] right why because that's what knowledge
[8:34] does
[8:35] &gt;&gt; this is the problem with knowledge
[8:37] because and if you don't get the right
[8:38] knowledge knowledge is going to produce
[8:41] doubt so you THAT'S WHY YOU CAN'T START
[8:43] WITH knowledge first.
[8:46] If you have knowledge first, you'll
[8:48] starve to death as a baby.
[8:51] Once he gets to know his parents, then
[8:54] he begins to distrust other people as
[8:56] his parents begin to teach him. Now, so
[8:58] remember this because we're going to
[8:59] speak about this. You're going to see
[9:01] this as the development of a human
[9:03] being. Isn't it amazing that this is in
[9:07] the Bible as a spiritual growth? It so
[9:09] matches the natural.
[9:12] So his parents begin to teach him. Now
[9:14] he's growing. And his parents teach him
[9:16] more knowledgeable. They'll tell him
[9:18] water.
[9:21] Water. Say water. What are they teaching
[9:24] him? What water is. When he when he gets
[9:26] to drink water, he's now teaching. He'll
[9:28] go water.
[9:30] So now he needs more ability, more
[9:32] knowledge. He's going to try and speak
[9:34] this. But when the next time he's not
[9:37] going to say ah and they give him water
[9:41] they're going to he's as he's GROWING HE
[9:43] GOES AH AND THEY SAY what do you want
[9:45] then he's going to go w then ah water
[9:50] why the knowledge has given him the
[9:52] ability to communicate he's developing
[9:56] &gt;&gt; but now he he's if he doesn't have faith
[9:59] in his parents to give him the water he
[10:02] won't use the knowledge to ask them for
[10:05] IT HAD TO HAVE STARTED WITH FAITH.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Then the knowledge works.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. So now he begins to start
[10:15] questioning everything. He needs his
[10:17] parents by his side constantly because
[10:20] he's beginning to lose his faith he
[10:22] originally had.
[10:24] Right? Where once the child lived by
[10:28] instinct and faith, now he starts
[10:30] depending on knowledge. He wants to know
[10:32] everything. wants to stick his fingers
[10:34] in the plug socket. Even when they tell
[10:36] him don't do that, he wants to try. They
[10:38] tell him don't do that.
[10:41] He wants to do it. He Why? Because
[10:44] knowledge is taken over. He wants to
[10:46] know things, right? And so once before
[10:50] he lived just instinct and faith, now
[10:52] he's depending on knowledge and then
[10:55] fear steps in because knowledge brings
[10:59] fear as well. Why? because his parents
[11:02] will say, "DON'T DO THAT. YOU'LL GET
[11:04] HURT. STOP IT. YOU'LL FALL. DON'T DO
[11:06] THAT. YOU" AND HE'LL be like, you start
[11:09] literally seeing it take over his body.
[11:15] Trust me, when we get to this, you're
[11:16] going to know what I'm talking about.
[11:19] And you people, what makes you fear
[11:22] demon spirits? Why should you fear
[11:25] demons? Why should you fear witch
[11:27] doctors and evil things and evil
[11:29] paintings and all? Why should why should
[11:30] you fear those things? What made you
[11:33] fear? Someone told you a story.
[11:36] Someone gave you corrupt knowledge.
[11:39] Someone made you afraid of be afraid of
[11:41] things that go bump in the night.
[11:43] Someone made you afraid of darkness.
[11:46] They gave you the wrong knowledge.
[11:49] And in knowledge created fear and fear
[11:51] created doubt.
[11:53] You should be able to stand in pure
[11:56] darkness and not be afraid because what
[11:57] is it? It's just darkness.
[12:00] What's there to be afraid of,
[12:04] right?
[12:06] You know, if you want to train a child
[12:08] to be a to be not afraid of darkness,
[12:10] sit in a dark room with your child and
[12:13] play games.
[12:16] You ever thought of that?
[12:18] Then they get comfortable in there. Play
[12:20] games with them. Sit there and say, "Can
[12:23] you feel my hand? Can you feel my
[12:25] fingers? Can you feel my face? Can you
[12:27] see this? Then I'm moving to this corner
[12:29] of the room. You come and find me in the
[12:31] dark. And they love hide and seek. It's
[12:34] pitch dark. And then the next thing you
[12:36] know the fear. Why? You give them the
[12:39] right knowledge.
[12:41] But when you yourself and the lights go
[12:44] off AND YOU GO, "OH."
[12:46] That whole thing transfers to your child
[12:48] and your child gets terrified of
[12:50] darkness.
[12:52] H.
[12:53] We'll get to that. Trust me there's so
[12:56] much to what our ancestors and parents
[12:59] did to us. is crazy the amount of things
[13:02] you know among the Indian girls like
[13:05] don't go out in the night with your hair
[13:06] open the spirits will grab you
[13:11] know when a when a hearse goes by touch
[13:14] wood otherwise you go next
[13:18] you know I see them some of my cousins
[13:22] will be like the hearse will be going by
[13:24] they all run to touch some kind of
[13:25] wooden furniture like what is going on
[13:27] with you people oh No, you have to do
[13:30] that otherwise you die next.
[13:32] It's ridiculous. When you get the wrong
[13:35] knowledge, it produces fear and fear
[13:38] produces doubt. We're coming to why this
[13:40] is important. So knowledge brings fear
[13:44] and
[13:46] in some ways right let's let's bring a
[13:49] balance to this.
[13:51] If you tell a child do not put your hand
[13:53] on a hot stove, you are giving him
[13:55] knowledge.
[13:57] But then
[13:59] he's not really going to understand that
[14:00] because the knowledge does not become
[14:02] effective unless he gets burned once.
[14:06] When he gets burned, that's the truth
[14:09] of the knowledge you gave him. Now he's
[14:11] never going to touch that again. Unless
[14:14] he actually experiences heat and cold to
[14:18] understand it, to know the truth of it,
[14:20] it cannot be powerful to him. A person
[14:23] cannot live life just being lectured at.
[14:26] You have to experience it.
[14:29] So fear also brings wisdom of danger.
[14:36] Okay? Let's not trash fear.
[14:39] So it's in natural life, it's important
[14:41] for us to have fear. Like for example,
[14:44] if you're walking on ground that's
[14:46] unstable, if you have fear of unstable
[14:49] ground, then you'll sense it and you'll
[14:51] doubt the ground. You'll walk carefully.
[14:53] You'll do something to protect yourself.
[14:55] You'll preserve your life. Are you with
[14:56] me?
[14:58] &gt;&gt; However, when it comes to the word of
[15:00] God, one should not be cautious with
[15:03] God's promises. What's there to be
[15:05] cautious about?
[15:08] Our belief in him should be like
[15:09] instinct. Like this is father.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; He loves me. He'll provide for me. He
[15:17] knows what I need. I will not doubt him.
[15:20] Instinct.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; So when it comes to the word, we should
[15:24] not be cautious with God's promises. Our
[15:26] belief should be instinct.
[15:28] Worse than this is something that grew
[15:31] because of our love for knowledge. So
[15:34] everybody
[15:35] today, if you want to know why our world
[15:38] is crumbling,
[15:40] are you with me? It's because of the the
[15:43] love of knowledge.
[15:47] This the smartphone and the internet has
[15:50] created the love of knowledge and placed
[15:52] the love of knowledge above everything
[15:54] else.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; You are consuming knowledge at a rate
[15:58] like no other humans in the past.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; Every time you watch YouTube videos or
[16:05] listen to a podcast or read the news,
[16:08] read the internet,
[16:10] let me just give you an example. What if
[16:13] the newspapers only reported positive
[16:16] news every page? What would your life
[16:19] then be?
[16:23] Do you realize news only reports
[16:25] negative?
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Like and most of the headlines is
[16:31] something negative. It's something
[16:32] against the somebody died, some
[16:34] earthquake, some plane crash. So many
[16:36] lives were lost. Imagine if they
[16:39] reported every plane crash on the the
[16:42] front page. You'll never fly a plane
[16:47] because that knowledge on increase is
[16:50] going to give you fear and you'll never
[16:52] fly a plane.
[16:54] EVERY IF EVERY PAGE of the newspaper
[16:56] every day reports murders, you'll think
[16:59] South Africa is filled with murderers.
[17:02] like what the Americans think about us
[17:04] today, you know, that we are all
[17:07] murdering white people in the streets.
[17:09] It's just not true. It's not happening.
[17:12] Criminals are murdering all races in the
[17:14] streets. And and it's not even like
[17:17] that. You could we live such a normal
[17:20] life. Criminals are are very nervous
[17:22] characters who don't want to be seen.
[17:24] They want to come and steal something
[17:25] and disappear without getting caught.
[17:27] It's because we get brave and get in
[17:29] their way, we get killed. It's different
[17:31] from the actual hitmen who want to kill
[17:32] you because you have millions in your
[17:34] bank account
[17:36] and they know they can get something
[17:38] from you. So in this country, if you
[17:40] don't want to be targeted by a hitman,
[17:42] don't drive a Rolls-Royce and flash it
[17:44] around. Wear expensive clothing and show
[17:46] people how much money you have in your
[17:48] live simple, humble, no one will touch
[17:50] you.
[17:53] The same same thing everywhere in the
[17:55] world, right?
[17:57] But look at this idea. The news is only
[18:00] negative. And what does negative news
[18:02] produce? Doubt, fear, anger, political
[18:07] sides being chosen. Nobody tells you the
[18:10] good that men do. You know, and in one
[18:14] corner of the newspaper on one page, you
[18:17] find this old lady saved a dog. Yay.
[18:21] Nobody even sees that
[18:24] one good news article for the whole
[18:26] week. An old lady saved a dog. Okay.
[18:30] Risked her life to save a dog.
[18:34] Imagine if they stopped writing news
[18:38] about only politicians and governments.
[18:41] What if they told us things that every
[18:43] regular person What if news reporters
[18:46] went around reporting on regular things
[18:48] that that people like you and I would we
[18:51] be interested in it
[18:55] today? No.
[18:57] Today you are addicted to negative news.
[19:01] Today you want you're following
[19:02] somebody. You're following some guy.
[19:05] You're following what they what they're
[19:07] talking about Donald Trump. You're
[19:09] following what they're talking about
[19:10] surroa. You're following the politics of
[19:13] the country. You want to know. You'll
[19:15] actually not read that newspaper because
[19:17] it's not giving you enough news about
[19:19] that. You're addicted to negative news.
[19:23] You're addicted to drama.
[19:25] And what does it produce in your body?
[19:28] Negativity,
[19:29] argumentative nature, hostility,
[19:33] uh uh prejudice.
[19:36] It's what knowledge you're feeding is
[19:39] what is producing an actual reaction.
[19:43] You know, I I meet young people. You can
[19:46] meet them at universities.
[19:48] I pick up my son at university, meet
[19:51] some of their colleagues and meet some
[19:53] of their people and you just within 5
[19:55] minutes you can already pick up this is
[19:57] not a happy person. This person has been
[20:00] indoctrinated with ideologies and and
[20:03] hate and nervousness and and all we are
[20:08] is one human to another.
[20:11] We've got the same red blood. We eat the
[20:13] same food. We live we walk in the same
[20:16] land. We're the same human beings. But
[20:20] what's your reason for distrusting my
[20:22] word? What's your reason for
[20:23] psychoanalyzing everything I got to say?
[20:26] Why can't we just take one another as
[20:29] human to human and appreciate who we
[20:31] are?
[20:32] Why? Because you're being fed negativity
[20:34] all your life.
[20:37] Why am I telling you this?
[20:40] What happens when you as a church are
[20:42] fed only one thing all the time?
[20:47] What happens to a message church when
[20:49] all you have is being corrected,
[20:51] corrected, corrected on the rules, the
[20:54] rules, the rules, the dressing, this,
[20:56] don't do this, don't do that. What do
[20:58] you think you're going to become?
[21:02] What what what if you are not being
[21:04] taught the goodness of God, the gracious
[21:08] graciousness of God, the the wealth, the
[21:11] richness in his word, the the word that
[21:14] teaches you what our behavior ought to
[21:16] be that challenges the fear and the
[21:19] doubt in your soul and brings light.
[21:23] See,
[21:26] we always want to know something about
[21:28] everything. We won't. And listen, all of
[21:32] us fall to this, right? You won't buy
[21:35] something unless you read the label. Am
[21:38] I right?
[21:40] And we don't understand. We don't even
[21:42] if we don't understand the label, we'll
[21:43] go to someone who works there and say,
[21:45] "This says this. What do you think about
[21:47] this? What do you recommend?"
[21:50] But you get some people who say, "Yeah,
[21:52] let's try it."
[21:55] Right? That doesn't mean those people
[21:56] have faith.
[22:00] And neither does the other person have
[22:02] faith. Let's try it. Is not faith.
[22:05] That's that's like risky behavior.
[22:08] That's like, well, there's a river
[22:10] there. There's a cliff here. Let's just
[22:12] jump off and see if it's deep enough for
[22:14] me to have a swim in. You're jumping
[22:16] from 30 m high. Let's just jump off and
[22:19] see if I live. That's stupidity.
[22:23] Okay. So we when we see those people who
[22:26] say ah let's try it we call them naive
[22:29] and reckless and immature but truthfully
[22:33] some people who will will be they
[22:36] probably live by instinct more than
[22:38] others
[22:40] like you so you get a lot of people who
[22:41] live by instinct they actually have a
[22:43] little bit more faith like you get
[22:45] people who will look down at the river
[22:48] and they'll see oh it's flowing quite
[22:50] fast that means it's quite deep and I
[22:53] can't see it And there's a certain color
[22:55] and this they are more in tune to their
[22:58] instincts than you are. And you look
[23:00] there for one, it's too high. I'm not
[23:02] doing this. I don't trust anything.
[23:05] Somebody will actually jump in and
[23:06] you'll see them falling. HEY, IT'S OKAY.
[23:08] YOU CAN JUMP. No way. I'm not doing it.
[23:11] I don't care whether you survive. I'm
[23:13] not doing this. You're just someone who
[23:15] doesn't even trust your own instincts,
[23:19] right? Because you've been brought up in
[23:21] a certain way.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[23:23] So we have become so dependent on
[23:27] knowledge that we doubt everything that
[23:31] we don't know about. To us that is
[23:34] natural and there is nothing wrong with
[23:36] that. So we live our lives being
[23:39] faith-based on our knowledge.
[23:45] That's the problem with the Christian
[23:47] church. You are telling yourself, you
[23:49] are basing your faith upon your
[23:51] knowledge. Your knowledge must be based
[23:53] on your faith.
[23:57] &gt;&gt; See, so if we know about something, then
[24:00] we won't doubt it. That's how we think.
[24:02] And then I'll have faith in it.
[24:06] Like that's so flawed because how do you
[24:10] know that what you know is actually
[24:13] right
[24:17] and it doesn't work? It never works.
[24:20] Right? we will even there now you you
[24:23] collect all this knowledge in and then
[24:24] you say okay now I understand it and now
[24:27] I want to base my faith on now I'm going
[24:29] to believe it because I understand it
[24:32] right and then you you say okay now I
[24:34] want to spread my faith I want to go
[24:36] tell people now you go and tell people
[24:39] and other people they listen to what
[24:41] you're saying they don't have all your
[24:43] knowledge but they think you're a fraud
[24:48] you don't really believe what you're
[24:49] Hey, and they're right because you base
[24:53] your faith on your knowledge. You don't
[24:56] have knowledge based on faith, which
[24:58] means they can tell, people can tell
[25:00] that your conviction is not real.
[25:07] This is how when a politician is
[25:08] speaking, giving a speech, when Sraapora
[25:11] is giving us a speech and we know, hey,
[25:15] come on, you can tell there's no
[25:17] conviction in there. when he says fellow
[25:20] South Africans everything is going to be
[25:22] all right
[25:25] right it doesn't matter what whether
[25:26] it's Emanuel Mccron from France whether
[25:28] it's Donald Trump from America wherever
[25:30] they are when they come out and give us
[25:32] a speech the moment they say good
[25:34] morning we know the first thing he's
[25:36] saying is a lie
[25:38] the way he's standing there what they
[25:41] came they put the flags behind they
[25:43] painted they put up a screen people only
[25:46] do that when they're not telling you the
[25:47] full truth
[25:50] Like why can't you tell the truth from
[25:52] wherever you are? Why do you need the
[25:54] whole setup to make you look like you
[25:56] are loyal to the flag to put the colors
[25:59] there to have certain important people
[26:01] like if you're coming to tell the people
[26:03] about the labor unions? You have labor
[26:05] labor union representatives there. Why
[26:08] must you have them there? To convince
[26:10] the people on the TV that I'm telling
[26:13] you the truth. Even these people agree
[26:15] with me. In the meantime, you paid them
[26:17] 10,000 rand each to be there.
[26:22] H right. What am I SAYING TO YOU? YOU
[26:26] got no knowledge, but you can tell
[26:28] you're a fraud.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; You has no conviction in you. You're
[26:31] you're knowledgeable. You're spouting
[26:34] all the right words in the legislature
[26:36] and the laws of the country and you're
[26:39] saying all the right things. You got the
[26:41] right catchphrases and you even know
[26:43] they've got these the little screens
[26:44] here. You know these teleprompterss
[26:46] where their words are flowing for them
[26:48] to just they're looking right and left
[26:50] and they're just reading things off a
[26:52] script and you know it's not even
[26:54] written by them. It's written by speech
[26:56] writers.
[26:58] So if you you're not even saying your
[27:00] own word, you're saying what your party
[27:02] wrote there for you to say. Who are you?
[27:05] You're a puppet.
[27:08] You're speaking words but you're not
[27:09] even you have no conviction over that's
[27:11] why I'm saying even to come here and
[27:13] preach a message and to go into chat GPT
[27:16] and say give me a message about you know
[27:19] statue of perfect man faith and he
[27:21] splits it out and then I come and preach
[27:22] from chat GPD I haven't even studied it
[27:25] I haven't even thought about I haven't
[27:26] even looked at it you'll know
[27:28] immediately this guy's a fraud
[27:32] you with me trust me that's going to
[27:34] happen a lot of people are already
[27:37] spouting sermons from Chad TPT.
[27:41] So we live our lives having faith based
[27:45] faith based on our knowledge and that's
[27:47] wrong. It's not it's not so with God.
[27:51] God needs to know that you can have
[27:53] faith
[27:55] and then he can give you knowledge.
[27:58] Just like that little baby once had
[28:00] faith and then knowledge came in. So
[28:03] does God require that of us. He begins
[28:06] our growth with faith AND ONLY THE THIRD
[28:09] STEP IS KNOWLEDGE.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Even before that is virtue.
[28:15] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So when you have faith
[28:18] in him, do you uh only then can you
[28:22] really get to know God. So So let's put
[28:24] it back to this baby. All the baby knows
[28:27] is these two people, mom and dad. He
[28:31] still doesn't even know what their names
[28:32] are. For the first few years of your
[28:35] child's life, you are mommy and daddy.
[28:38] They don't know you. They don't know how
[28:40] you met. They don't know where you came
[28:42] from. They don't even they know grandma
[28:44] and grandpa. They don't even know how
[28:45] grandma and grandpa are connected to him
[28:48] to him or to you. They don't even know
[28:50] that's your that's daddy's father.
[28:52] That's mommy's father. They don't know
[28:54] that. They get zero knowledge on that.
[28:57] They just recognize you're a familiar
[28:59] person who comes to this house every day
[29:00] and gives me treats and tells me nice
[29:04] things and your name is grandpa
[29:06] or grandma. They have no connection
[29:11] to who you are in the family. They don't
[29:14] even know who their siblings are. The
[29:16] little baby grows up. This is his
[29:18] brother and sister. He doesn't even know
[29:20] who they are. There's no knowledge. All
[29:23] he has is ability to get along with
[29:26] them. Amen.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; He's going to get to know who they are
[29:30] over time.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[29:35] &gt;&gt; That's how it works. God's not even
[29:37] going to give you knowledge from the
[29:38] get- go.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; You need faith first.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; To have faith is to believe in something
[29:45] without proof. Amen. Believe in it
[29:50] without proof or reason or want of
[29:53] anything.
[29:56] Okay, let's get to doubt versus faith.
[29:58] Are you still with me? Believe me, we're
[30:00] more than halfway through.
[30:04] So, doubt is not a real thing.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Just as death is not a real thing, life
[30:12] is real.
[30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; Death is the absence of life.
[30:17] Got it? If you see a a dead man,
[30:22] that's no longer a person. The person is
[30:25] gone. That that cannot even be
[30:27] identified. There's no identification.
[30:30] There's no life in it. It cannot speak.
[30:32] The dead body is is just now an empty
[30:36] shell.
[30:37] It is a nothing.
[30:41] It then becomes you put it in the
[30:42] ground, you put it in the furnace, it
[30:45] has gone into nothing. That death is
[30:48] nothing.
[30:49] Life is everything.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; Life is real.
[30:54] Light is real. What is darkness? It's
[30:56] the absence of light.
[30:58] &gt;&gt; What is doubt then? It's the absence of
[31:01] faith.
[31:02] &gt;&gt; How do we know that? Because when a baby
[31:04] is born, he starts off with faith first.
[31:08] Then is bad knowledge starts removing
[31:12] faith. And the absence of faith is
[31:15] doubt.
[31:16] Got it? That's the simple concept of it.
[31:20] Now let's test it. Truth is reality.
[31:25] Lies is not reality.
[31:28] Are we together?
[31:31] Do you understand? Is that clear?
[31:34] &gt;&gt; If someone lies to you about it, means
[31:36] it's not true. It means it doesn't
[31:37] exist.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; The truth actually exists. The lie is
[31:41] not real.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; So if someone said, "Brother Alistister
[31:46] said this," and if that's the truth,
[31:49] that's exactly what happened. But if
[31:51] they told you I said something that I
[31:54] did not, it it's not even real. It never
[31:57] even happened. The words they said that
[32:00] I said did not even go out into the
[32:02] ether.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; It's a lie. It never even happened. Are
[32:07] you with me? It's not reality. So what
[32:10] is a lie then? It's the absence of
[32:12] truth.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; Death is the absence of life. These are
[32:17] there there are real things. Love is
[32:19] real.
[32:21] uh life is real, truth is real.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[32:25] &gt;&gt; And they have become now what's happened
[32:27] in in this world is you are being fed
[32:30] lies every day on the internet, in the
[32:34] newspapers, in religions.
[32:37] Is that right? And you are living by
[32:41] something. You are trying to put faith
[32:43] in something that is not real. It's not
[32:47] even true.
[32:52] And what's going to happen is everything
[32:55] that that is unreal is being posed to us
[32:58] as being the truth and being real being
[33:01] reality.
[33:03] So then what happens is it comes into us
[33:06] and uh because of doubt we start to
[33:09] accept things that are not real as if
[33:12] they are real.
[33:14] Let's make that plain.
[33:17] If somebody comes to you and lies to you
[33:19] about your brother or sister or family
[33:21] member and you believe the lie, what
[33:24] does it mean? What does it even mean
[33:25] that you believe the lie? Because it's
[33:28] not even real.
[33:30] &gt;&gt; What it means is you accepted it by
[33:34] knowledge and reasoning and you now are
[33:37] acting upon it
[33:39] to go and live by it. You're starting to
[33:43] live by something that is not real. That
[33:45] means you'll start if somebody comes and
[33:47] tells you that person said this about
[33:49] you and it's not real. You then will
[33:52] start living your life treating that
[33:54] person in a way as if they actually said
[33:57] something and that person is genuinely
[33:59] confused like why is that person not
[34:02] greeting me today? Why did they not
[34:03] shake my hand? Did I do something? Did I
[34:06] say something? And that and you're
[34:07] walking around like yeah I know what you
[34:09] said.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; You know this is how it's going to be.
[34:13] I'm not going to phone you. I'm not
[34:14] going to visit you. I'm not going to do
[34:16] anything from now on. You don't even You
[34:17] sit over there. I sit over here and it's
[34:19] not even reality.
[34:24] Amen. So what happens is someone gave
[34:28] you false knowledge and it's allowing
[34:31] doubt to enter in because faith is being
[34:34] removed. Knowledge does not necessarily
[34:37] mean truth.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:40] Sometimes the knowledge that you receive
[34:42] is corrupt knowledge and it produces
[34:46] more doubt than it should. Are you with
[34:49] me? Let's read. Greatest battle ever
[34:51] fought. The great hour of charge is at
[34:54] hand. Hallelujah. Soldiers with with
[34:56] armor gleaming, color streaming, faith
[34:58] and doubt. I want you to see brother
[35:00] Madam is saying faith and doubt is set
[35:04] is setting themselves in array. Faith
[35:07] and doubt like two armies are setting
[35:10] themselves ready for battle in this
[35:14] tabernacle this morning. Doubt on one
[35:17] side, faith on the other side. Soldiers
[35:20] stand at your post of duty.
[35:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our captain the morning star
[35:24] leads on. He never goes back. He don't
[35:27] know the word retreat. He don't have to
[35:29] retreat. Amen. The faith side does not
[35:31] retreat. The greatest battle ever fought
[35:34] is going on right now. Yes, sir. Between
[35:35] life and death, between sickness and
[35:37] hell, between faith and doubt. Oh my.
[35:39] Between liberty and bondage, the battle
[35:41] is on. Shine your spears, soldiers,
[35:43] polish up the armor. There is always
[35:45] been a war going on in our souls between
[35:48] doubt and faith.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; Since doubt is not a real thing, you
[35:52] cannot really get doubt out.
[35:57] You can only put faith in.
[36:01] &gt;&gt; You got it?
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:03] &gt;&gt; All right. This is why the only thing
[36:05] you can actually place faith in is
[36:08] truth.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:11] &gt;&gt; Let's go to expectancy. Message
[36:13] expectancy. Faith knows no defeat. Faith
[36:16] is perfect. Faith brings things when
[36:18] there is no things to be brought. Faith
[36:21] creates. Faith takes doubt away. Takes
[36:24] negative and makes positive. How
[36:26] beautiful. Faith is not mythical.
[36:28] Something mentally worked up. It's an
[36:30] absolutely fundamental result that
[36:33] happens in a person's heart. When faith
[36:35] is appropriated, there is something in
[36:37] the person's heart. But it can't be
[36:39] based on say well go touch a tree,
[36:42] you'll get well. Pray to the post. It's
[36:45] got to have a foundation.
[36:48] That foundation is the cornerstone. It's
[36:50] got to be based on Christ. Let's go to
[36:52] Romans 10:17.
[36:54] So then faith cometh by hearing and
[36:57] hearing by the word of God. Now hold
[36:59] that thought. Faith cometh by hearing.
[37:02] In the Bible, hearing does not mean I
[37:05] heard you.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; In the Bible, when they say I hear you,
[37:08] it means I understand you.
[37:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Now, faith comes by understanding.
[37:14] And not just understanding.
[37:17] Understanding comes by the word of God.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Faith comes by understanding.
[37:23] Understanding comes by the word of God.
[37:25] Which means you must have understanding
[37:30] that comes from God that Jesus is the
[37:33] Christ.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; And faith comes by that.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with us?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Hearing. So you don't need all the
[37:42] knowledge in the world. Do you see that?
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; You don't need knowledge. This is the
[37:48] fallacy. Knowledge doesn't give you
[37:50] understanding. Amen.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; I mean, do you know how many people read
[37:56] the newspaper and don't get the right
[37:57] thing?
[37:59] Do you know how many people read the
[38:00] internet and get the wrong You can hear
[38:03] 20 different stories from the same
[38:04] article.
[38:07] It means people will read the same thing
[38:08] and not get the right understanding. Do
[38:11] you know how many This is the reason I
[38:14] still have a job.
[38:16] When I say that, I mean that as a
[38:19] pastor. The reason why there still has
[38:21] to be a five-fold ministry is because
[38:23] people read the Bible for 2,000 or 1,500
[38:26] years, the English Bible, and still get
[38:28] it wrong.
[38:31] Which means the only thing is we by the
[38:33] Holy Ghost are tasked to bring
[38:35] understanding.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; We can't rewrite the Bible. The Bible is
[38:40] there. There's the knowledge.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; We are tasked by the Holy Spirit to
[38:44] bring understanding.
[38:48] See it. The word of God gives us
[38:50] understanding only because of one thing,
[38:53] the Holy Spirit.
[38:55] He shall guide you into all truth.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:17 to 18. That the God of
[39:04] our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of
[39:06] glory, may give unto you the spirit of
[39:08] wisdom and revelation in the knowledge
[39:09] of him, the eyes of your understanding,
[39:11] being enlightened, that you may know
[39:12] what is the hope of his calling and what
[39:14] the riches of the glory of his
[39:16] inheritance in the saints. the eyes of
[39:18] your understanding
[39:20] being enlightened.
[39:23] What does it mean? How does it happen?
[39:25] By the Holy Spirit. How he's going to
[39:28] give you the spirit of wisdom and
[39:30] revelation.
[39:31] Can you see that? That he may give you
[39:33] the spirit of wisdom and revelation in
[39:35] the knowledge of him. He's not giving
[39:37] you the knowledge of him so you can get
[39:39] wisdom and revelation.
[39:46] Job 32:8, "But there is a spirit in man,
[39:50] and I love this, and the inspiration of
[39:52] the Almighty giveth them understanding."
[39:57] So faith cometh by understanding, and
[40:00] understanding comes by the spirit of
[40:02] God.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Understanding comes by the word of God.
[40:06] So people will say, "Oh, the word of
[40:08] God, the Bible, that's the written
[40:09] word." The word of God is a person. It's
[40:13] the logos. It's the revelation of all
[40:16] things.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:17] &gt;&gt; 1 Corinthians 14:14-15.
[40:20] For I pray, for if I pray in an unknown
[40:23] tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my
[40:26] understanding is unfruitful.
[40:29] What is it then? I will pray with the
[40:31] spirit and I WILL PRAY WITH THE
[40:34] UNDERSTANDING ALSO.
[40:38] I will sing with the spirit and I will
[40:40] sing with the understanding also. You
[40:43] don't just pray. You don't just sing.
[40:46] You sing with understanding. You pray
[40:48] with understanding.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Most Christians only want to sing in the
[40:54] spirit. Shout in the spirit. Pray in the
[40:57] spirit. Do you hear that? They think
[40:59] praying in the spirit means praying with
[41:01] tongues.
[41:02] Where's the understanding? Because if
[41:05] you have the understanding, then you'll
[41:06] be led of God to pray the right thing.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; To know what it is you're singing.
[41:13] So understanding then is actually
[41:16] revelation, which is what? The rock from
[41:19] the beginning.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Faith can only come into your soul
[41:25] if God grants you revelation. Saints,
[41:28] let me put it to you this way, and I and
[41:30] I keep saying this in our church back
[41:32] home in Durban. Um the only way you can
[41:35] really grasp this is like marriage.
[41:42] Marriage has to start with faith.
[41:46] Not even love
[41:48] because love is so far a concept you're
[41:51] coming into.
[41:53] Like when two when a young boy and a
[41:55] young girl meet each other, they don't
[41:57] know it. Do you agree? They don't know
[41:59] anything. In other words, zero
[42:01] knowledge.
[42:03] agreed.
[42:05] She looks attractive. He looks
[42:07] attractive. He's got a nice job. She's
[42:10] got a nice job. He's got a nice family.
[42:12] She's got a nice family. Those things
[42:14] you only going to know when you start
[42:16] talking to each other. You will never
[42:20] start talking to each other unless it
[42:22] begins with a little faith.
[42:24] It has to start with faith. You have to
[42:27] first trust. There must be like some
[42:30] small modicum of trust to come forward
[42:33] and to start speaking to each other
[42:35] first because if there's no trust is
[42:38] there's only doubt you'll say the guy's
[42:40] a creep. I don't want to talk to him.
[42:42] She just doesn't look right. I just
[42:43] don't want to talk to I want nothing to
[42:44] do with him. What? You don't even know
[42:46] them. Your friends are going to say GIVE
[42:48] IT A SHOT. YOU DIDN'T EVEN SPEAK. YOU
[42:51] DIDN'T EVEN take him on the first date.
[42:52] You didn't even take her on the first
[42:53] date. Second date, third date to get to
[42:55] know them. Try that. It doesn't work.
[42:57] You try first date, second date, third
[42:59] date, fourth date. By the time if you're
[43:01] still going to take dates to find out,
[43:04] you start ending up with more doubt.
[43:09] If you're a person who's been filled
[43:11] with doubt already, your faith is not
[43:13] going to give you the correct knowledge.
[43:18] And every kind of knowledge you're going
[43:19] to get thereafter. So this is why I
[43:22] often say to people for a marriage to
[43:26] work you have to never stop believing in
[43:29] each other.
[43:32] Love will become perfected because you
[43:34] believe in each other. There it is.
[43:39] You understand? Love will break down if
[43:42] you stop believing in each other. It
[43:44] always has to be faith
[43:49] understanding
[43:51] that then is actual revelation. Are you
[43:53] still with me saints? The only thing you
[43:56] can do to get it is as much of his word
[43:58] as possible when it comes now to God. So
[44:02] after you have had faith, now you go and
[44:06] he's going to give you the word based on
[44:08] that faith. And that knowledge is going
[44:11] to give you the correct knowledge which
[44:12] is going to increase your faith which is
[44:14] going to allow everything else to be
[44:16] built upon that bringing you to
[44:18] perfection.
[44:20] Amen. So if we can do this in the
[44:23] natural with natural things like the
[44:25] natural growth of a child
[44:28] uh so also is this possible in the
[44:30] spiritual except God has to give it to
[44:34] us first to start us off. There's no way
[44:37] you're going to do it yourself. Thou art
[44:39] the Christ, the son of the living God.
[44:41] No man could have revealed this to you
[44:42] but my father which is in heaven. Which
[44:45] means when you are seeing Christ,
[44:49] no man is going to convince you. Only
[44:52] God can do that.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; God is going to be the beginner. That's
[44:56] why the the first faith you receive is
[44:59] the gift of faith.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; You love him, saints. And and you know
[45:05] all the scriptures. No man can come to
[45:08] me except my father draws him. No man
[45:12] can call Jesus the Christ except by the
[45:14] Holy Ghost.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; All right,
[45:18] let's bring this to a close.
[45:21] Saints, doubt is sin.
[45:28] What I I I feel like a lot of people
[45:32] like I've got to stop here and tell you
[45:34] a lot of people don't know what sin is.
[45:37] People think sin is to you know like do
[45:42] something against God's word.
[45:46] A lot of us do things against God's word
[45:48] every day.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Simply because we are humans who haven't
[45:53] gotten over ourselves yet and we're
[45:56] hard-headed, stubborn things, you know,
[45:58] and we're still trying to get our own
[46:00] way. That doesn't mean we hate God or we
[46:02] disbelieve him. That still just means
[46:04] we're struggling a little with ourselves
[46:05] and God understands that. That's not
[46:07] sin.
[46:09] When in the Bible it says fornication is
[46:11] a sin against your own body,
[46:14] &gt;&gt; what it means is you're damaging your
[46:16] own nature.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; You you're doing something to yourself.
[46:20] Of course, God can heal that, right? God
[46:23] can heal anything.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; But sin is something that corrupts the
[46:28] original nature.
[46:30] That's what sin is.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; Okay, hold this in in in mind. Let's go
[46:35] to all things are possible to him that
[46:38] believeth.
[46:40] Doubt is always of the devil. That's
[46:44] where the first sin come from. There is
[46:47] no other sin but doubt. Unbelief is the
[46:51] So in other words, he's he's saying
[46:53] doubt equals unbelief.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; Unbelief is the original and only sin.
[47:01] Committing adultery is not a sin.
[47:04] Smoking
[47:06] cigarettes is not a sin. Getting drunk
[47:09] is not a sin. That's attributes of
[47:12] unbelief.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to draw you to. Doing
[47:16] all those things that then hurts your
[47:18] body.
[47:20] You're only doing that because there is
[47:22] doubt in your heart.
[47:25] Because there is unbelief in your heart.
[47:28] You got it?
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Those are attributes. Attributes means
[47:32] they they are actually things that are
[47:33] going to produce be produced because of
[47:36] something.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; You know any child born in this world is
[47:45] not an evil being
[47:48] is a just a real regular innocent
[47:52] perfect little soul.
[47:54] That soul is going to be hurt by humans
[47:59] from its parents to its siblings to its
[48:02] teachers to its university lectures.
[48:04] It's going to be constantly trampled on
[48:06] putting in doubt into this little soul
[48:10] and it turns from being an innocent
[48:12] being into somebody who is led down a
[48:15] path. Okay. So in the prayer lines,
[48:19] brother Madame would constantly pray
[48:21] that God would remove the doubt from the
[48:23] hearts of the people.
[48:25] He said in other places that doubt is
[48:28] sin, drinking smoke in many other
[48:31] places. They're not sin. Doubt is the
[48:33] actual sin. All these things were
[48:36] attributes of doubt and sin. It is
[48:39] because of doubt that we go out and do
[48:41] all these other things. without doubt we
[48:44] would be doing things of God and living
[48:46] righteously.
[48:49] Let's go to Matthew 21:21-22.
[48:52] Just one scripture and one quote and we
[48:54] close.
[48:56] Faith can accomplish great things. H
[48:59] let's see it.
[49:02] Jesus answered and said unto them,
[49:03] "Verily I say unto you, if you have
[49:04] faith and doubt not, you shall not only
[49:08] do this which is done to the fig tree,
[49:10] but also if you shall say unto this
[49:12] mountain, be thou removed, and be thou
[49:14] cast into the sea," it shall be done.
[49:16] And all things whatsoever you shall ask
[49:18] in prayer believing, he shall receive.
[49:21] You shall receive. So this is the thing.
[49:23] People want to be people that move
[49:25] mountains.
[49:26] What mountains?
[49:29] Hey, like I I want to leave the
[49:32] dragonsburg where it is. There's no
[49:35] reason to go move that. It looks
[49:37] beautiful right there. There's no reason
[49:39] to move actual. So what are the
[49:41] mountains he's talking about? It's the
[49:44] strongholds of things caused by unbelief
[49:48] and doubt.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Right? You see the mountain as your
[49:54] problem. You you see the smoking, the
[49:57] drinking, the fornication, the
[49:59] pornography. You see that as the
[50:02] mountain? That's not even the mountain.
[50:05] That's been stuff built on a foundation
[50:08] of doubt.
[50:11] What is causing you to doubt?
[50:14] What is causing you to devalue yourself?
[50:18] Right? Faith can accomplish great things
[50:23] if there's light in your soul. You
[50:25] wouldn't desire that. If there's light
[50:27] in your soul, if you're living by a life
[50:29] of faith, you'll be more relaxed. You'll
[50:33] believe in people. You'll believe in
[50:35] God. You believe tomorrow is secure. God
[50:39] knows all things. You'll wake up with a
[50:42] smile. You'll trust him in all things.
[50:46] Faith can accomplish great things. the
[50:47] greatest battle ever fought. The last
[50:49] quote as we close,
[50:51] you can have little consciences and
[50:53] little feelings and little sensations
[50:55] and all these things that has nothing to
[50:57] do with it. That's just little
[50:59] sensations and things. And when it comes
[51:01] to reality, your mind opens it up. Your
[51:04] mind either accepts it or rejects it.
[51:07] That's it, friends. God let none of them
[51:10] miss it. It's your mind that opens up
[51:13] the door or closes the door. listens to
[51:15] your conscience, listens to your memory,
[51:16] listens to your affections. But when
[51:18] your mind closes itself to these things
[51:21] and let God, the spirit of his word,
[51:23] come in, it blows the rest of the stuff
[51:26] out. Every doubt is gone. Every fear is
[51:28] gone. Every sensation of doubt is gone.
[51:31] Every feeling is gone. There's nothing
[51:33] standing there but the word of God. And
[51:36] Satan cannot battle against that. No,
[51:39] sir. He cannot battle against it. Now,
[51:41] we know that's the truth. So this is our
[51:44] biggest fight here on earth. In the
[51:47] stature of a perfect man, faith is the
[51:50] first step. It is the foundation. It's
[51:53] quite clear. He had to take away doubt
[51:56] before attempting to put the other
[51:58] virtues in us.
[52:00] &gt;&gt; Faith is the strength. It's uh it's the
[52:03] one of the seven virtues we need to
[52:06] overcome doubt in our souls.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. So in closing,
[52:11] I want to explain that to you. When you
[52:14] live as a person with more doubt than
[52:17] faith, that's when you become anxious of
[52:20] everything. Untrusting,
[52:23] where you believe even when people
[52:24] telling you the truth, you don't trust
[52:26] them. You believe they're lying. Uh
[52:29] living like that is stressful. It causes
[52:32] depression. It puts problems in
[52:35] marriages. It put problem between father
[52:38] and child. It put problems between
[52:41] teachers and and students. It puts
[52:43] problems between the heads of countries
[52:45] and the people because people are living
[52:48] with darkness in their souls. If you
[52:51] lived with people who have faith, if
[52:55] people have faith and people live by
[52:57] faith, you will be more positive. You'll
[53:00] want to testify of your faith. And when
[53:03] you testify and you tell people of Jesus
[53:05] Christ, they will see that there is a
[53:07] conviction inside. If you preach the
[53:10] word, they'll know you know what you're
[53:12] talking about. They know you believe
[53:14] what you're talking about because they
[53:16] can sense there is light from within.
[53:18] There's something else coming. But when
[53:20] you yourself have doubt, they'll sense
[53:23] it. What I'm saying to you is if you
[53:26] have doubt in your soul, it leads down a
[53:28] certain path. If you have faith, it
[53:30] leads down a different path.
[53:32] Literally
[53:34] everything about your life will be
[53:37] different if you have faith.
[53:42] I mean even your home will be decorated
[53:46] differently.
[53:49] H even your dogs will be happier.
[53:54] Do you know that a dog is a pack animal?
[53:58] You have dogs. They'll they'll literally
[54:00] tell you dogs take on the the nature of
[54:02] the owner.
[54:04] You understand? So, if you got stupid
[54:06] dogs, you know what it means, right?
[54:10] I'm just kidding.
[54:12] You've got to understand that faith and
[54:15] doubt produces different parts of life.
[54:18] It's the foundation for all things. And
[54:21] you will build every aspect of your
[54:23] life. If you have children and if you
[54:26] live with doubt, you will raise your
[54:28] children on doubt.
[54:30] That'll produce a certain path for them.
[54:33] If you raise your children on faith, it
[54:35] will produce a certain path for them.
[54:39] It all starts there. Faith is the
[54:41] perfect foundation and the only
[54:44] destroyer of doubt.
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Let us bow our heads
[54:47] together.
