TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads together. Dear heavenly father, we humbly bow in your presence this morning. We're so thankful, Lord, for your presence with us, your grace, your mercy, the love, the strength, the joy that we feel in our hearts. Truly Lord, your word has been the inspiration of our lives, the inspiration of our path before us. There is none like you, Lord. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like your word. There's nothing so beautiful. There's nothing that we treasure more than this great word that you have revealed in these last days. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you for your people, the manifestation of your divine nature made flesh in these last days. the light that has struck the earth. &gt;&gt; Father, we are so thankful, Lord, for this glorious message &gt;&gt; that you brought to us and purposed that it be abiding in our hearts, &gt;&gt; manifesting through our souls, through our flesh, through our words, through our actions, through our lives. Lord, making us better people. Not just better people but chosen people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the works that were for ordained before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Lord we appreciate you this morning and we ask you to bless the service to us. Bless the reading of the word, the preaching of it and all of us here gathered together. It's just a human gathering as some would say. But Lord two mysterious elements are meeting. And where that happens, there is omnipotence, there is love, there is joy, there is peace, there is celebration, there is rejoicing. And we are thankful to be a part of that meeting this morning. Bless us now, Lord, we pray. Ask it all in your precious name with much praise and thanksgiving. Amen. &gt;&gt; While you're standing, let's read in our Bibles. I'd like to take a reading from Luke chap 24 and verse 18-32. Very familiar portion of scripture. Those of you who know this as from the message that brother Vam preached and when their eyes were opened Luke 24:18-32 and if you're there the word of God reads like this and the one of them whose name was Cleopus answering said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? And he said unto them, "What things?" And they said unto him, "Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty indeed, and word before God and all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and they have crucified him." But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel. And beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done. Yay. And certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sephila. And when they had found not his body, they came, saying that they also had seen a vision of angels, which said he was alive. And certain of them which were with us went to the sephila and found it even as so as the woman had said, but him they saw not. Then he said unto them, "Oh fools, slow of heart." Watch that. Slow of heart. How that How's that going to change? Heart needs to be quickened. &gt;&gt; Amen. slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken. &gt;&gt; Ought not Christ to have suffered these things? It's as if it's telling them something they should have known, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory? And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. And they drew nigh unto the village wheither they went. And he made as though he would have gone further. But they constrained him, saying, "Abide with us." For it is toward evening, and the days far spent, and he went into tarry with them. And it came to pass as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and break it, and gave to them, and their eyes were open, and they knew him, and he vanished out of their sight. And they said one to another, "Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures?" Watch that. Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us? What are they talking about? The walk. &gt;&gt; Their heart was burning on the walk. &gt;&gt; And why was their heart burning? because he was opening the scriptures to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what the open book means to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord add a blessing to his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm extremely grateful, honored, and privileged to be here speaking the word of the Lord with you this morning. And I'd like to just greet every one of you. Bring greetings from South Africa. Uh and uh just from all the saints there. We're just like you. We're flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; We're receiving the word of God. We're growing day by day. We're closing on to perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh we trust that that is your experience. We know that is your experience here, too. So, I just want to thank um dear brother Chad for the invitation and confidence that we could be here and share the word of God with you. And I'm certainly happy also to be like I said sharing the battlefield with my dear brother. It's uh not always you get um part of the commonwealth here together you know Australia and South Africa. Uh so but we're appreciating the the divine word of the lord the his planning. It's all him and we appreciate that. just listening to him uh and the two of us in the last few days, it was the struggles we had to go through to get here. &gt;&gt; I was asking, Lord, are we really supposed to be there &gt;&gt; and what's going on? And so, but I'm just so thankful to see how it all worked out and we appreciate also. Thank you to brother Ray. He's always been wonderful to me in the years that I' I've known him and to my dad, brother Steve. So we appreciate you my brother and all the visiting people here. May the Lord bless you. Also want also like I I thank those at the True Word Tabernacle. Just thank you for your prayers for us in the passing of our brother Steve and we appreciate that. Gave us a lot of strength, encouragement. So uh we just appreciate you. Amen. So I want to um get into the word this morning. I don't like to waste too much of time because I like to spend most of the time on that. But um I you know coming together to meetings like this and when you have more than one minister I've never I've never been used to that. Usually just go to a place where I'm invited and I speak by myself. But speaking with another minister can be challenging. But I was so encouraged last night. I can't wait for this evening to hear the summation of it. So, but the way things happened is it kind of uh adjusted what I was going to speak. Of course, I had a copyright which uh but so it kind of adjusted it and like a bit of a title here and there. And so I I wanted to take this and break it up over two services, but now we're going to put it all into one &gt;&gt; by God's grace. And perhaps tomorrow do something more. wait for tonight and see what happens and then move in tomorrow. Perhaps there's another copyright happening. But so I want to take from that from the leading of the Holy Spirit. I believe it was and uh uh we'll have a title and a subtitle. And so the title will be the mysterious element. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're going to talk about the mysterious element and the subtitle the burning heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's simple. The answer lies within you. &gt;&gt; Christ didn't do anything else but go back to the scriptures and reveal to them what they had already known what was in their heart. &gt;&gt; There's nothing new we can give you. &gt;&gt; But he went back to the word and started revealing what was inside. Amen. &gt;&gt; So just as an introduction uh I think a lot of people don't appreciate this. you and and we were talking o over the the last few days. Do you realize you are living in the day of the unfolding of the seventh seal? &gt;&gt; Right now, don't just agree with that. You've got to see the reality of it. &gt;&gt; In Paul's day, he was living in the unfolding of the first seal. &gt;&gt; What What happened? The what? What does the unfolding do? It produces a whole lot of events, right? &gt;&gt; So, here was the the messenger coming out, Paul. And what was the unfolding of the first seal? A white horse rider. &gt;&gt; That's the symbol. How did it manifest in people? &gt;&gt; How did it do that? A a church began to rise up. A false church. A church that was copying the original, &gt;&gt; right? And it was a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; It had it was white &gt;&gt; which is religion. &gt;&gt; It looked like it had power. It had a bow. It was given a crown. It &gt;&gt; means people gave it recognition. &gt;&gt; This was where was this happening? Where was this White House writer? In people &gt;&gt; and every seal that unfolded and the manifestation was manifested in people. People are thinking the seventh seal is all about Christ coming in the air and him appearing. That's never been the case with the with the seals. &gt;&gt; The seals has to be the mystery unfolding in people. &gt;&gt; It's always in people. &gt;&gt; Even when you look at the theory and you and you talk about it, it unfolds in people. You've you're going to see it. The world will react. The world is reacting according to the unfolding of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; The bride is reacting according to the unfolding of the seventh seal. It's all been there in the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here are the important things and I don't want to labor that because I know your pastor has already done that. But the the fundamental things about the seventh seal is that the seventh seal brings him back to earth. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now look how simple that is, right? The seventh seal brings him back to earth. Now unpack that &gt;&gt; because it's so easy to go to the Pentecostal understanding of Christ coming back to earth, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And listen, don't take us for granted. That's part of the seventh seal mystery. &gt;&gt; The greatest of all the seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if every other seal had a mystery to it that was hard for the people to see. &gt;&gt; If the seventh seal is the greatest of all the seals, don't think the coming of the Lord is just going to be something that someone's just going to simplify. &gt;&gt; No, it's not going to be that way. Of course, it's going to be simple because you're the elected to you, &gt;&gt; but to everyone else, it's hidden. &gt;&gt; It's a seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the seventh seal bringing him back to earth is not going to be something everybody sees or everybody expects or everybody understands or has a revelation of. &gt;&gt; How do we know? Well, how many believed the first coming? &gt;&gt; I want you to think of the gravity of that. &gt;&gt; All right. Everybody seems like preachers all over the world think that they just talk about the coming of the Lord and everyone gets it. Nobody got it in the first coming. &gt;&gt; I want you to think of the gravity of this. The very Messiah, God himself made flesh, had only 11 followers. &gt;&gt; I mean, if he couldn't convince all of Israel, how can we convince the whole world of the coming of the Lord? So don't be surprised by the resistance you get, &gt;&gt; right? Cuz no matter how you try to explain, they are going to reject you. &gt;&gt; And those closest to you &gt;&gt; because in the very end, the majority of the message in his day turned away. &gt;&gt; The moment the third pull was preached, &gt;&gt; eat my flesh, drink my blood, they said, what is this? &gt;&gt; What's that? That that was word that required revelation. &gt;&gt; And look at the elect. He turns around. He said, "Will you leave me also?" &gt;&gt; What was the elect's words? Where shall we go? &gt;&gt; You have the words. &gt;&gt; Of eternal life. &gt;&gt; The true elect were seeking word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the type itself shows you how few &gt;&gt; there will be. Now it gets even I would say worse than that but better for us in this message desperations. He says how is it this paragraph 53 how is it that we can see other great signs and wonders done on others. And what about us? It should cause an a state of desperation that we are determined before God. Now I want you to see something. The prophet never says things outright. I have always young people asking me. Yeah, but you're explaining. You're explaining. Why doesn't he just say things outright? Why didn't Christ say things outright? &gt;&gt; Why didn't he just come out and say, "I am the son of God, the word, the logos made manifest in this day. I am the Messiah." Why didn't John the Baptist come out and say, "I am the forerunner of the first coming." They come and ask him, "Who is he? I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness." Then they ask him, "Are you are that are you that prophet?" No. &gt;&gt; It even looks like he lied. &gt;&gt; Right? You read that? &gt;&gt; Well, who are you? Are you the Messiah? Are you that prophet? No. &gt;&gt; They keep referring to scripture. &gt;&gt; They keep going back to the word. Back to the scripture and they expect you to catch it. &gt;&gt; So, even in the word, you'll find in unveiling of God, I think it is round about page six where the or just in the beginning, the prophet said, I hope you're catching &gt;&gt; what we've been trying to say without saying it outright. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God permits it for us to say it that way &gt;&gt; to thin it down. &gt;&gt; To shift some out. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when we read these quotes, and plenty of quotes, you know it all. I want you to see he's not going to say when when he's talking about the cloud, he's not going to say, "Did you know the cloud on sunset mountain February 28th? This and this and this. That's what we're talking about. That's what it is." Or such and such a time. That's what it is. when he speaks about the the vision in uh um ass is this the time he refers to it as he told us then and here it happened now you you remember all that &gt;&gt; so watch this he says the signs of his coming the signs of his coming &gt;&gt; should bring his entire congregation when we've read it from the word so when you read signs of his coming what sign what sign right now he starts to tell you without saying it outright says the Holy Spirit has told us go at certain place such and such a thing would happen. What's he talking about? Let's just say where did the Holy Spirit tell him? So is this the time? Go out west, go to uh uh Arizona. Such and such a time this will happen. Not tell us what it was, but it would happen. We go there and it happens that way. Now you get the clue. The newspaper packs it. The magazines packed it. Show the picture of it, &gt;&gt; right? Come back. What's he said? It's a sign of his coming. &gt;&gt; Come back here and see those great mysteries. What's that? The week where you preach the seven seals, &gt;&gt; right? Come back here. See the great mysteries hidden in the Bible open up to us on a new field that we never knew before and blends perfectly blends into the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus. A new field we've never known before. &gt;&gt; It perfectly blends into the coming of the Lord. Can you see the coming of the Lord is not just going to be what the Pentecostals know, what everyone else knows. It's a new field. &gt;&gt; We've never known before. &gt;&gt; If it's a new field, we shouldn't be preaching something that everybody else knows. &gt;&gt; Then paragraph 54, at the end of the messages, see the action of the great Holy Spirit. See him come down visible before the people. Even take pictures of it. See it working, showing that it's not a man. &gt;&gt; What's it revealing? It's not a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; What's he saying? It wasn't me. &gt;&gt; Catch it, church. &gt;&gt; It wasn't me. &gt;&gt; It's not a man. &gt;&gt; It was me, but it wasn't me. &gt;&gt; Even take picture. See it working, showing it's not a man. It's not just a preacher. &gt;&gt; You You understand, right? It's not a certain congregation. It's the Holy Spirit showing the same thing it did when it was embodied in the body of Jesus Christ. Now it's embodied in the body of his bride. There's the three-fold. It showed uh it should throw us into desperation. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. And this is where I want to uh get to now you know this God's great mystery of how it's a secret. He kept it a secret. Nobody know anything about it. What's he talking about Bible readers? &gt;&gt; The secret nobody knowed about &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The second coming of the Lord, right? Uh and then he says even the angels didn't understand it. He didn't reveal it. Now I want you to see in this particular quote how he joins the coming of the Lord, the seventh seal and the thunders. &gt;&gt; This is the forerunner. &gt;&gt; He has the authority to do that. &gt;&gt; He if you had any uh confusion about it before, here it is. Right. &gt;&gt; The coming of the Lord, the seventh seal, and the thunders are all linked. &gt;&gt; There it is. Let's read. &gt;&gt; He's what the great secret no one knew about. The angels didn't understand. You said it's the coming of the Lord, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Even if you nodded your head, you're responsible. That's the reason under our seventh mystery, that's the seventh seal. When the seventh seal was opened, there was silence. Why was there silence? the coming of the Lord &gt;&gt; right Jesus when he was on earth they wanted to know when he would come are we talking about the coming of the lord right and it's not e even the son himself don't know it when it's going to happen see god has it all himself it's a secret and that's the reason now watch how he joins everything that's the reason uh there was silence in heaven for a space of half hour and seven thunders out of their voices and John was forbid bidden to write it. See &gt;&gt; the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come. If he hasn't revealed it yet, what is it? Well, that's part of the unknown language. &gt;&gt; That's part of the mysterious element. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have to prove that in the scriptures. &gt;&gt; But then people say, see, he didn't reveal that the time and the hour. The secret is not the time and the hour. &gt;&gt; I want to ask you that. If God, what is it? It's it's Saturday. If God said came to you and said, "Right now, the coming of the Lord, the rapture is taking place, the translation is taking place on Tuesday at 9:00 in the morning." Right now, how many of you will be ready on Tuesday? &gt;&gt; If the secret was the time and the hour, how many of us will be ready? &gt;&gt; I'd be frantic. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I I don't even know whether the things I have to repent of will be enough. I'll have to think of things I've never repented of. I don't even know what I've done. &gt;&gt; How will you ever get it done by Tuesday 9:00? &gt;&gt; The secret is not the physical time or the hour. &gt;&gt; It cannot be. &gt;&gt; And yet the church world believes that. &gt;&gt; You know, 2012, who was that guy? Richard Camping I think it was Canada something like that said it was 21st I don't know April May then that failed then uh 21st September then that failed people have been doing this for how long &gt;&gt; date and hour and people gathered together and it's the rapture and we're going away it's not that and they're going to keep guessing at that &gt;&gt; you know you feel like they like this hype &gt;&gt; oh it's a secret we got Got to watch. If we're not watching, what happens when you're sleeping? We got to watch. Got to watch. Otherwise, we be caught unawares. We'll be taken away. Caught unawares means having no revelation. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So then he he concludes it. It's a good thing that he doesn't know. And I love this paragraph of 107. So he hasn't revealed it. He hasn't told you everything, but he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the Bible. &gt;&gt; You want the mysterious element? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember what he was saying last night? There's a mysterious element. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's hidden in every type. &gt;&gt; So, church, that behooves us. If the mystery of the coming is in every type, &gt;&gt; we have to go search it out. &gt;&gt; And guaranteed when we find it, you're going to have a burning heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's what we hope to achieve this morning, a burning heart experience. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So very quickly before I get to the actual message when we look at the seventh seal and I don't want to get into all of that but you know the prophet said I seen it unfolded in three-fold manner one unfolded yesterday one today one in an unknown language right so uh even when you look at that you can work out the theory of that and and like when when brother Chad was saying he was anticipating the seventh seal and uh reading through it and I did it read through the whole message and I got to the part and he's here and there explaining things. He's speaking things from the sixth seal. He's speaking things from the first seal. He's speaking things all over the place. And then he gets to this portion. He says, "Stop the tape." Right? And then he says, "I want to speak to you on the that fold." And he says, "Stop the tape." And then then you're thinking, "Well, now this is it." Right? And then he talks about the baby shoe and the rainbow trout and Junior Jackson's dream. But then he starts dropping hints. He says, "When this gets out, the people are going to think brother Vanam is making too much of himself. &gt;&gt; Watch that. When this when this gets out, they're going to think the wrong thing." &gt;&gt; Right? So when you look at how the seventh seal unfolds, what is it? If the seventh seal is the coming of the Lord or reveals the coming of the Lord when it's broken, if it brings him back to earth, what is Christ coming back to earth? Right? God descending, right? So what we see is three manifestations. God descending or condescending like brother Baron said which is probably grammatically or incorrect in in English God condescending cuz you know when we use the word condescend it's like we're looking down on someone &gt;&gt; you're being so condescending right but the prophet says condescending and it's true because he's he's coming into a lower state &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; so the first thing we see open up is a sign in the heavensmen Yes. &gt;&gt; And notice the prophet doesn't even know that he was there in Sunset Mountain. But you know something, he didn't even pick up the 28 minutes that it was about the space of half an hour &gt;&gt; the whole time. He didn't. It was the bride that did that. &gt;&gt; He kept talking about it in seven angels and then the the 63 starts talking about the seven angels. Did you see that? He only sees the picture of it in the magazine in May 17th or something and then starts talking about it. Said that's it. That's what happened when we were there. And um so thereafter 64 he's talking about the angel with the swept back wings and the notable one and all that. He comes back to by 65 he's annoyed because the brothers, you know, you know people in the message. Oh brother, look at it there. Can you see that in there? Can you see this? They must have been seeing a whole lot in there. and he started getting agitated and he's praying on it, looking at it. In 65, God says, "Turn the picture to the right." &gt;&gt; And when he turns the picture to the right, he says, "That's our Lord up there." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't identify that in ' 63. &gt;&gt; He didn't identify it in ' 64. It only happened in ' 65 at the rising of the sun message. &gt;&gt; Amen. It is Easter with the Lord and I. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So notice that even that that manifestation that first part of the descent &gt;&gt; the shift from the seventh dimension to light matter time. &gt;&gt; The next step I want to ask you is a man. Now Revelations 5 says no man was worthy to take the book to even look thereon &gt;&gt; to open the seals. No man was worthy. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine the pressure on that prophet when it was revealed to him? Do you know what you were doing yet in March 17 to March 24th? He said, "Did you see this mysterious week that it hasn't been a man, &gt;&gt; it's been them angels?" &gt;&gt; Said, "He came in every night and revealed himself to me." Right? So what we see then is a further descent. &gt;&gt; God becoming his prophet. I I think even in the seventh seal he prayed that the lamb stand here tonight to open the seat. &gt;&gt; God becoming the prophet. &gt;&gt; Now this is where everyone stumbles because if you can't see that wave sheath, &gt;&gt; you cannot be the crop. &gt;&gt; How can you see Christ becoming flesh in you if you couldn't see Christ becoming flesh in the prophet? Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring a purpose, &gt;&gt; right? And that's the descent. &gt;&gt; Sign in the heaven, God in the prophet, God in the people. &gt;&gt; You can see him anointed ones at the end time, he gets struck. He said, "A son of man revealing the son of man." &gt;&gt; Christ the mystery then says, "God, the godhead bodily in the people." Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can see that's the descent. &gt;&gt; God moving from heaven to earth. &gt;&gt; That's the mystery. &gt;&gt; Right &gt;&gt; now we can speak it. You can say amen. Now that we've told you, well, we're still here. &gt;&gt; You know, we know it, &gt;&gt; right? But it has to become flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you, like we were saying over this these last few days, uh stop thinking that when you get it, it's time to go. &gt;&gt; Stop waiting to go. The word has brought you to fulfill a purpose &gt;&gt; to become a better husband, &gt;&gt; a better wife, &gt;&gt; the right grandfather, &gt;&gt; the the best husband. &gt;&gt; Remember, the best teenager, &gt;&gt; the best child, the best church member, the best pastor. &gt;&gt; Stop running away from that and waiting for a translation to give you an escape. &gt;&gt; Let's finish our purpose. &gt;&gt; Let's run the race. The seven seal has come to make you run the race that you were chosen for. &gt;&gt; And it's not being a church member. &gt;&gt; That's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; I'm enjoying myself here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not waiting to escape. I can't wait to see what more he can do through me. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; So, now that you see those three manifestations of the coming and how it unfolds, that's a simplicity. That's a skeleton. right now. Now, we must see because he said so. It's hidden in all the types and shadows. And that's what we want to do this morning. &gt;&gt; I spent about two years going through all the types and shadows from Genesis all the way through to Malachi because of that quote. &gt;&gt; And I guarantee you it's all there. &gt;&gt; It's all there. those three manifestations, the three folds, the unknown language, God in the prophet, God in the people, &gt;&gt; the sign in the heaven. Now, sometimes you'll see exactly the three folds. It's so unmistakable, right? You know, the prophet said in Christ the mystery, he said, "Well, if you if you haven't seen if you read the Bible and you don't see Christ, go back and read it again." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Well, if you read the Bible and you don't see yourself in there, go back and read it again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you read the Bible, you don't see the coming of Christ in every type and shadow, go back and read it again. &gt;&gt; If you read the Bible and you don't see the fulfillment of the seventh seal, go back and read it again. &gt;&gt; You will see it &gt;&gt; once you understand what happened &gt;&gt; in the unfolding of the seventh seal in your day. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So sometimes, and this just we're almost done with this introduction, when you get to the when you get to the types, you're going to see the actual threefolds. Sometimes you're going to see the victory under the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see the judgment. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see the conditions of the day. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see a character change. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see the purpose under the seven seal. Sometimes you'll see the revealing of both comingings, first and second, and the comparison, the differences. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you'll see rapture and resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know something brother Daniel was saying last night and and I was wondering you know was he doing this on purpose? He was saying I'm becoming kept saying that. Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; I'm becoming here I am. I'm becoming. Do you know that's the actual meaning of Jehovah? &gt;&gt; Yahweh. Y vave. Yh. It does not just mean I am. I am means I am is English. Oh, I am Alistister. You know in the Bible I am means I exist. &gt;&gt; Right? It doesn't just mean I am. &gt;&gt; In the original Jewish text, Hebrew text it means I become. &gt;&gt; I am never in one state. I become. And then when he said when and Abraham said Jehovah Gyra, we just simplified the Lord will provide. Do you know what it means? Because it's added to Yahweh Jehovah. It means I asked it to be and here it is now. &gt;&gt; Here I am. &gt;&gt; I asked it to be and here it is now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jehovah means I become. And the prophet simplifies it and said the selfexisting one. &gt;&gt; And all through we see the mystery of God, self-existing one, logos, theophony, man-made flesh, people, the bride of Christ, the church. It is all God becoming. &gt;&gt; That's what you've got to see. You've got to hold those thoughts in your mind. All right? So, are you ready to start? &gt;&gt; Right from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to see those three folds. &gt;&gt; We're going to see the seven seal unfolding. &gt;&gt; We're starting right at the beginning, the book of Genesis. Every type will show it to you. So, what do we start with? Genesis 1, right? &gt;&gt; And and on to Genesis 3. We see this earth hurtling through the universe &gt;&gt; without form and void. It's not doing its purpose that God chose it for. &gt;&gt; It's a piece of rock and things on it. It's chaotic. It's hurtling through. It doesn't have any orbit. It doesn't have any control. What does God do? He's got a solution. His solution is light. Right? &gt;&gt; So, what do we see? The first coming of light. &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Now, we seeing coming, &gt;&gt; right? the comingings of the Lord, first coming of light. This is not the sun because we know that happened on the fourth day, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, we see this light, right? And and it's part of the first coming of light because he's going to bring this to the earth. But the first coming of light was the matter, the actual capability of it. And then we see that in the fourth day that light becomes the sun, the moon, the stars. What's it doing? It's bringing order to the earth. The earth starts getting its form. It gets its orbit. Can you see that? &gt;&gt; The earth is is now moving. It's revolving around the sun. This is like Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. What happens? What happens when Christ comes the first time? Then come the stars, the messengers, the order, this chaotic world starts to come into order and we see this church forming and the real life of God starting to move. And we see people starting to see they used the Bible for governments. Every single government was transformed by Christianity. &gt;&gt; They were all in tribalism and terrible situation. And here is this this uh the first coming producing this order for the earth. &gt;&gt; Animals start to grow. Uh plants start seeds begin to be sewn. Then what's the second coming of light? Genesis 1:26-27. Theophony of man. That's the light. That's the second coming of light. &gt;&gt; How do we know? John 1:1, in the beginning was the word. The word was with God and so on and so on. He is the life that lightth every man. &gt;&gt; Right? Who is what is theophony? He is light. The logos, king Theophony. Now, the coming of man is the second coming of light. Remember we spoken on Thursday night how that man was sent to bring order on earth. The first coming of light brought order to the whole thing that was surrounding earth. But now man is the next coming of light to earth. And that should complete it. &gt;&gt; Now the coming of man had three folds. &gt;&gt; Genesis 1:26. Right. &gt;&gt; Theophony. There's everything contained in that theophony. two attributes in perfect harmony. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; Genesis 2:7, that theophony comes down and becomes one with the fleshly body. &gt;&gt; But there's he standing. He looks like a man. &gt;&gt; There's a mysterious element inside him, &gt;&gt; but he looks male. He looks masculine. Prophet said, "But in him was a secret, a feminine attribute which was not yet revealed. He put everything in order, put the animals in order, sorting things out, walking around, but something is missing. There's a mysterious element, the third fold of the mystery, the unspoken part, the unknown language. &gt;&gt; God puts him to sleep, brings out the last manifestation of light. &gt;&gt; And that's the second coming in the first type. &gt;&gt; Unmistakable. &gt;&gt; It's there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you see anything that resembled the Pentecostal idea of the coming? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Absolutely not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's go to the next. So, this what was the secret? What was the secret? What was the mysterious element? The woman. &gt;&gt; Because with and and watch I could go on with that type. How do they become what? Separate them and brought a marriage. The first marriage &gt;&gt; the two become one flesh. &gt;&gt; As long as that marriage holds. The mystery is complete. The manifestation is revealed. &gt;&gt; It was the marriage covenant that made them co-equal. &gt;&gt; They walked around wherever they went to placing things in divine order. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Abraham, right? So in Abraham, we see Genesis 15, Abram, well before that Abram is called from um of the Chaldes. He makes his way. You you follow it. You follow every chapter, every verse. It's unmistakable, &gt;&gt; right? He comes with Lot. We heard last night. He he brings it down. He comes to Genesis Genesis 15 and there's the first coming. That's the first time he sees God. &gt;&gt; Right? Prior to that, it was just a voice. &gt;&gt; Go to Canaan. &gt;&gt; No manifestation, nothing. Genesis 15 comes the covenant. I will make you a father of many nations. You will receive us the promised son. Experience the promised son from your own bowels. And then God comes down in a pillar of fire and moves in the in the form of an eight between the pieces, the two altars, right? Separated. And God makes a covenant with him. Immediately after that first coming, Genesis 16, what do we see? A false church arising, persecuting the real bride, &gt;&gt; Hagar, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then you, in other words, your church ages are beginning, &gt;&gt; right? And then we see chapter 17, Ishmael, the firstborn son, the Pentecostals, receiving the circumcision, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Enjoying it for a long time. &gt;&gt; Genesis 18, we see the appearing of the Lord, &gt;&gt; on the plains of memory, &gt;&gt; the messianic sign, &gt;&gt; the prophet, the appearing before the coming proving that it's about to happen, the promise is about to be fulfilled. Genesis 18, he comes there. We see the discernment. We see it happening now. It's a turn turn his back &gt;&gt; that &gt;&gt; brother, that sister. You've seen it happen. Amen. And then now we already know after the first coming, Abraham's stream of life which was dead is now healed. &gt;&gt; Which means the male is already producing seed. How how do we know? Because he produced a son through &gt;&gt; Hagga, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But Sarah's still not healed. So after this this message starts coming forth. This is how we know it's a process &gt;&gt; because there Genesis 18, Genesis 19, Genesis 20 what happens there life is going on. God reveals so many things to uh to Abraham. We see Sodom and Gomorrah being judged. We see the two witnesses um Paul Roberts Billy Graham going out to the world to the lost. We see that right? And then we see Sarah and Abraham going into a land of Aimilec. &gt;&gt; And Aimilec falls in love with this &gt;&gt; this woman. And and no offense to our wonderful people who are older than me, but the prophet said Aimilec was not going to be fall in love with a 90-year-old granny. &gt;&gt; Something happened. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That means her body was changing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Waiting for the last manifestation. And then Genesis 21 says, "And the Lord visited Sarah &gt;&gt; according to the time of life, according to his set time, &gt;&gt; second coming of the Lord, as promised, &gt;&gt; bringing forth the son, the Christ child in the bride, &gt;&gt; the barren womb has been opened." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect type. &gt;&gt; Amen. Any Pentecostal idea of the coming &gt;&gt; the types don't reveal that &gt;&gt; right? Let's go to Isaac and Rebecca. This is just beautiful. I don't know. We could spend hours on just this one, &gt;&gt; but you know it. There is Abraham. He's a type of the father. Eliza is a type of the prophet. Isaac is a type of the son, Christ. &gt;&gt; Rebecca's the type of the bride. You all got it? &gt;&gt; So, he sends the prophet. He says, now the first thing we see in this type is, do you see Isaac does not physically in a corporal body of his own set foot in Mesopotamia. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Isaac himself does not come physically in a corporal body to Rebecca &gt;&gt; in her land. &gt;&gt; The coming to her through the prophet, &gt;&gt; right? Eliza makes his way. &gt;&gt; Now message time of decision. Watch the three foes. The prophet said, "I believe in time of decision that the angel &gt;&gt; beat Eliza there by about half an hour." [Music] &gt;&gt; And told her, &gt;&gt; "It's time to go and get water." &gt;&gt; First fold, &gt;&gt; right? The second fold has got to do with the prophet. &gt;&gt; He comes there, he puts forth a mystery. And this is wonderful uh uh tradition that they had there. At that time, you know, it's not like today we all meet up at church and we see a girl we like, a boy we like. No, at that time the culture was the ladies of of a respectable house would not be seen walking in the streets. But there was an evening time where they would dress up. They would carry their water pots. They would walk with the maidens and all the the eligible suitors would sit near the wells and regard them and then see the one that they thought they could make a marriage to and then they would ask. That was the tradition at that time. So Eliza positioned himself at the right place. Came there the wells outside the city. That's the right place. Not inside the city &gt;&gt; where the disrespectful ones were. &gt;&gt; This was the respectful tradition. &gt;&gt; So he positions himself. Now who sets forth the mystery? The prophet. &gt;&gt; Lord, he prays. Let it be. &gt;&gt; It's got to be according to how he put it out. &gt;&gt; So he's not just going to come out and say it all out. There's a mysterious element to it. There's an unspoken part &gt;&gt; that she's got a catch. &gt;&gt; He But that between him and the Lord, it's known. &gt;&gt; Right. I seen it happen. &gt;&gt; I seen it unfold into them thunders. &gt;&gt; We're not right there at that cycle right now, but we're moving into that cycle. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, he puts forth the mystery. Here she comes. And this is the character of the bride. Now, you know, this wasn't this fairy tale well with these bricks there and a little roof and a crank handle like this and a bucket going down. No, these were a hole, massive hole dug down to the water table with circular staircase going down like that. This wasn't just bringing up one jug of water for this prophet to drink and for camels. 10 camels &gt;&gt; who drink. Well, &gt;&gt; you should know, right? &gt;&gt; She had to water all the camels. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't have time to go into all the types, but she's got to water the prophet. That means she's got to recognize him. &gt;&gt; Then she's got to recognize the ministry that's going to take her to the bridegroom, &gt;&gt; which is the camels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there's so many scriptures in there. So anyway, &gt;&gt; she now says or um he asks her flat out after she completes the unspoken language. &gt;&gt; She uh he says, "My master Abraham has a son and I've come to seek a bride and you are her. &gt;&gt; Uh will you come?" He says, "I need to go and say goodbye to my family and get my things." No resistance. &gt;&gt; Amen. So watch the continuous manifestation of the third fold. She goes to the family, the family's happy. Wow, it's a marriage happening. Fantastic. But why don't you stay 10 days? &gt;&gt; Remain here in this denomination. &gt;&gt; We're okay with this. Remain in the old tradition and the old thinking. Let's come fellowship with us. Come. And and Elisa is getting antsy. Anxiety. No. No. I need to go. My master Abraham. I'm the reason why I'm telling you this. my master Abraham. He's calling Abraham the master, the master, the master. And my master's son, he's waiting for his bride. We've got to go now. Under the third pole, it says, "Let the maiden speak." &gt;&gt; The first time I I don't know if you know Eastern tradition, the maiden doesn't have a voice. &gt;&gt; Everyone makes the decision for her. &gt;&gt; This is the first time. Let the maiden speak. She said, "I will go." &gt;&gt; Amen. And she'll receive all the gifts pertinent to the bride at that moment. The cuffs, the earring, the garments from the prophet. And off they go. &gt;&gt; Now, did you notice on the way? I'm not going to cover all that. You know it all. Did you notice how the um the ch the verses in the Bible match the years? &gt;&gt; Right. Genesis 24. If you haven't, I'm sure you you probably have, but Genesis 24, I'm just going to refer to it. There's a reason why I didn't put everything on the screen because we're going to be flying through so many scriptures. Genesis 24 and verse 62. Now, look at this happening because the prophet starts receiving a vision in 62. Now, you remember in 62, he starts the year 62 with presuming. We should not presume, do not adventure into uh without authority. remember all that. Don't venture without authority. Then he comes up with this meme vision at the end of 62 and he he starts the time with we're presuming. &gt;&gt; Is it this? Is it the thunders? Is it that? Is it this? Is it that? Maybe it's this. Maybe it's this way. He's messed up in his mind. He's perturbed. He thinks maybe it's my death. &gt;&gt; Right? This verse says this the time. So he ends up presuming he's in a terrible state of affairs, but something is happening. Something is fixing. What happens here in verse 62? And Isaac came from the way of the welly for he dwelt in the south country. So if you look at Israel, the wellroy, by the way, leeroy means the well of the one seeing me. &gt;&gt; He's seeing me. He makes the first move. He's going to make the first move. What does he start doing? So, he's in the south. Actually, it's southwest. And he starts moving east. Isaac starts moving east. He, you know, how long the journey is from Mesopotamia coming down from the north, moving towards uh um uh the plains of memory. It's a long journey. How does he know that it's about time? Well, obviously he's seeing me. &gt;&gt; I know nothing, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Verse 63. And Isaac went out. There are 63. Isaac went out to meditate &gt;&gt; in the field at the even tide. Sign in the heavens. February 28. Isaac goes out first. Amen. First fold. And he lifted up his eyes and saw, and behold, the camels were coming. He sees that word that brings the bride. &gt;&gt; That's what he's seeing, right? He's seeing it happen. That's the first part. 64. And Rebecca lifted up her eyes. Are you seeing the visions happening? &gt;&gt; She lifts up her eyes and she doesn't see anything else. She sees this man. &gt;&gt; And when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel. &gt;&gt; She had to get off. what she was traveling on for a long time. &gt;&gt; She sees it and gets off the C. It's a monumentous occurrence. &gt;&gt; Whatever we've been dealing with in the past, something is changing. &gt;&gt; We've been walking with Eliza so long. &gt;&gt; They developed randomism. Yes, we might as well say it. &gt;&gt; Message religion, &gt;&gt; all of that. But now it's time to get off the camel. &gt;&gt; Amen. But 65, she turns to the prophet unto the servant and said, "What man is this?" She didn't say, "What clout? What man is this?" This shows a revelation of the word becoming flesh. &gt;&gt; That's the question. &gt;&gt; What man is this? Right? And the servant had said it is my master. &gt;&gt; He doesn't say my master's son. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; The entire chapter, my master Abraham, my master's son Isaac. &gt;&gt; When the bride and the groom have come together, &gt;&gt; he becomes the master. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the manifestation of the word is incomplete without the bride. Amen. And only then when the when the two matching pieces, the one who's revealed and the mysterious element are brought together is when he becomes the master. &gt;&gt; How do we know? Because Christ when he came the first time, he wasn't the master. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Why? Because Satan's standing there and says, "Bow down to me and I'll give you the kingdoms of the world." &gt;&gt; Which means the kingdoms of the world were not belonging to him yet. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Get thee behind me, Satan." What happens in the seventh trumpet? Right. &gt;&gt; Now are the kingdoms of the world become the Lord and his Christ. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got to bring the two matching pieces together and then he is the master. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is complete by us. Glory to God. And you see then 66 well the prophet passes away. 66 fellowship between the prophet and the Lord. I've done everything, Lord. It's done. It's over. And we never see him again. &gt;&gt; We never see him. It's all now about Isaac and Rebecca. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Isaac brings his uh Rebecca into his mother's tent. &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful for that? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; There's the types. &gt;&gt; Any Pentecostal ideas in there? &gt;&gt; Is your heart burning? &gt;&gt; All right. How about Jacob? Look at Jacob. This guy is a suppler. He's a deceiver. He's a bad guy, &gt;&gt; right? I'm speaking to you now. The coming of the Lord is personal to you. &gt;&gt; He lied. He cheated. He didn't just lie to his brother. He lied to his father. &gt;&gt; He disguised himself. He put goat hair on him &gt;&gt; to look like his brother. &gt;&gt; His brother asked him, "Is it you?" Esau. Yes. Yeah, you smell like him. But the voice sounds like Jacob. No, I'm Esau. I'm your firstborn. I want the blessing. He was a bad guy, &gt;&gt; but he wanted the blessing, right? &gt;&gt; Now, this man, as bad as he is, he seems to keep meeting angels. &gt;&gt; He goes to the house of God. He's running away. He's He's a coward. He's running away from his brother because his brother sought to kill him. First place, first coming to Jacob, Bethl. He's laying on a pillow. Jacob's ladder we call it. Opens up. He says, "Surely God has been in this place." He names it Bethl. First coming of God to him, he keeps on going. Where does he go? Off to find uh some place of refuge. There he finds his wife. We know the story. He gets tricked. He gets two wives. Then he tricks his father-in-law again, &gt;&gt; pulls all the cattle with him, amasses a great uh uh uh uh uh business, and then starts going back home. Now, he knows he's a promised son. He's got the birthright. He's got the blessing. He has to take his place. So, but he's a coward. You know what he does? He puts his wives in front, the children in front, the cattle, the livestock, and he's right at the back. He wants them all to appease Esau. And by the time they get to him, it's going to be all right. We forgive you. I seen all I've seen your sons. Oh my, I can't kill you. Now look at this. He wants them to he wants Esso to be appeased. And it's at that moment he reaches pineal, second coming of the Lord to Jacob. What does he see at pineal? Pineal means I have seen God face to face. &gt;&gt; It means facing God. And this coward wrestles with the angel. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And says, "I will not leave you until you bless me." &gt;&gt; I want you to think about that. Don't think of an actual You know what wrestling is, right? &gt;&gt; Wrestling is not kung fu and all that. This is wrestling is grappling. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you got to grab a hold of someone, get a good foothold, &gt;&gt; and try to overthrow him. &gt;&gt; That's wrestling. So, I mean, can't God beat a human? &gt;&gt; Can't an angel beat a human? And the Bible says Jacob was prevailing? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is what happens under the seventh seal. A true son of God is not going to let go. &gt;&gt; Reveal it to me, Lord. I'm not moving. I'm not satisfied with what everything is going on. I'm not satisfied with who I am. And the bride is prevailing. &gt;&gt; And finally, the angel relents. Okay. Okay. Enough is enough. Name change. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. Facing God and my life is preserved. &gt;&gt; How about Joseph? Look at Joseph. The Joseph perfection. Are you still with me? We all know Joseph is a type of of Christ beginning to end. Watch the mystery. Tell me again if you're seeing any Pentecostal idea in there, any denominational idea in there. So here he is. We spoke of it on Wednesday on on on Thursday. We saw him receiving the seven coat and so on. And watch the brothers. They throw him in the pit. Three days first coming right after that. They sell him to the Gentiles. Gentile church ages start to open up, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; What happens in the dark ages? He ends up in prison. &gt;&gt; Three days he there he meets the baker, the butler. The word is about the the the written word is about to die. But the wine of revelation is going to survive. &gt;&gt; But at the end, there's a sevenfold mystery. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To bring Joseph out of captivity. A seven-fold mystery comes up and it's so mysterious. The pharaoh himself forgets &gt;&gt; and needs a man &gt;&gt; praise God &gt;&gt; to reveal &gt;&gt; not only reveal but even tell the vision &gt;&gt; right and what does the vision open up seven fat ears of corn seven lean ears of corn seven fat cows seven lean cows seven seals seven trumpets &gt;&gt; how do we know because it's going to take the seven lean to call the brothers &gt;&gt; the seven seals to the bride is the trumpets to Israel So what happens is he comes out. Here's this Hebrew. He in his second coming he's changed to a gentile. &gt;&gt; They shave off all his hair. &gt;&gt; He clothed in Egyptian garments. Stands before the pharaoh. &gt;&gt; Receives the preeminence, the ring, the throne, the knee that should bow, the trumpet, the chariot. And what is he doing? Storing up food. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. storing of food. He receives a bride, a gentile bride who happened to be a part of the priestess, right? But there she is and this beautiful uh type begins to unfold and then come the trumpets. &gt;&gt; You can see now the second coming to the Gentiles is different to the second coming to Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's still a Gentile. &gt;&gt; Now what happens is uh the the Israelites come to him, the brothers. Here's all the brothers coming, right? But little Benjamin is not there yet. &gt;&gt; He's working with them. He brings them in. He starts revealing to them tribal order. &gt;&gt; Puts them around a table. Tribe. They were messed up. Puts them in tribal order. Puts them through things. Starts giving them blessings. They give him money. He gives back the money. He fills their sacks with grain. Right? &gt;&gt; And then finally comes the testing. He tricks them. Bring Benjamin. When Benjamin comes in, he puts Benjamin under tribulation. Silver cup of redemption in his sack. Says, "He's mine. You go back. Here's my prisoner." What's must what must happen? The one who actually sold Jacob uh uh Joseph must now repent. &gt;&gt; Who was that? Judah. &gt;&gt; Said, "My Lord, you cannot do this. This will break the father's heart. Take me." &gt;&gt; The nature changing. And it says he couldn't contain himself anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He takes off the Egyptian garments. &gt;&gt; He reveals, I am the Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, I'm the brother you sold. But this had to happen for a reason. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; There's the comingings of the Lord. &gt;&gt; In the type of Joseph, &gt;&gt; but you know that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God. How about the Exodus? Crossing over of the Red Sea, right? &gt;&gt; First coming of the Lord brings repentance, putting Egypt behind you, washing away the Egyptians by a great mighty manifestation. Passover token was beautiful, right? &gt;&gt; Then starts church ages, wilderness walk, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's it. Go have a look at it. That's you. You whenever you come to salvation then start your wilderness walk. &gt;&gt; You'll see everything in your life. Kora, day ever water from the rock, mana, quailes. You'll see wonderful things. You'll see the tabernacle being set up. You'll see the priesthood coming alive. You'll see the law coming in. But when it comes to the second coming, Moses goes up to the mountain. Nebo looks upon the promised land. Notice the prophet does not go into the promised land &gt;&gt; with the bride. &gt;&gt; He dies before. &gt;&gt; He gets taken away before. But he sees the full vision. &gt;&gt; I saw it unfold into them thunders. We're not there yet. We're waiting for that great one to come upon the scene. &gt;&gt; So the opening of Jordan is the opening of the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; And what happens when you open Jordan? There's no prophet &gt;&gt; leading you. There's no Moses standing there with a staff. You've got to step in by faith. &gt;&gt; Where's Joshua? He's somewhere. He's not leading them. He's somewhere amongst them. &gt;&gt; He He didn't put his step in his foot in first. And then what happens? Jordan opens. They put rocks inside. They put rocks on the outside. &gt;&gt; Open and sealed evidences. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then they cross over. Now what happens when they cross over? This is the word to to the the children of Israel says be strong and courageous. You have not walked this way before. &gt;&gt; You have not walked this way before. What comes by the opening of the seventh seal is some a new field. &gt;&gt; Amen. you've never known before. &gt;&gt; But be strong and courageous. &gt;&gt; You know what? Being strong is not No, no, no, no. We must say exactly what the prophet said, &gt;&gt; or else you must Where's the quote, brother? Where's this? We'll show you by the end. You're going to have no proof to prove to somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to step in by faith. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; We see something else happen in this type. Remember the first the mystery of it all is these people crossed over through the seventh seal into the promised land not having the circumcision. &gt;&gt; Why? What happened? The Pentecostal circumcision happened in Egypt as 8-day old babies. &gt;&gt; Baptism of the Holy Ghost came with kicking, screaming emotions. What happens under the baptism of the Holy Ghost under the seventh seal? It's mature men. &gt;&gt; It's painful. &gt;&gt; It's stay in your tent until you are healed. &gt;&gt; And then roll away the reproach of slavery &gt;&gt; of Egypt. You cannot be an inheritor if you still feel like a slave. &gt;&gt; You cannot have that spirit of slavery on you. You cannot take the land unless you have the mark of Abraham. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay there. &gt;&gt; Circumspect. &gt;&gt; Introspection. Stay in your tent. &gt;&gt; I'll meet you in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get healed. &gt;&gt; And then let's go and take Jericho. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; I want to show you this particular thing. There's so many things I can tell you like you'll see the the first and second coming in the manner that fell in the wilderness and the quailes. What was the mana? Brother man said morning food. &gt;&gt; Quails was evening food. &gt;&gt; Evening food comes with a cloud that comes out of the sea moves in. And what we see in there is the character of the people. They started eating. &gt;&gt; Wrong. &gt;&gt; There were very few who ate the evening food correctly. &gt;&gt; Go have a look. But I don't want to go into that now. I want to get into the tables of stone. How many tables of stone were there? Two. How many comingings of the tables of stone? Two. What happened with the first table of stone? It was broken. It was Calvary. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Because of the sin of the people. Exodus 24 1-4 in verse 4 it says and ro and or rather this is important. In the first tables of stone it was written by the finger of God. That's Christ &gt;&gt; written by the finger of God. The word written in that man, by God himself, not born of anything else, but born by the prophecy of God, a virgin shall conceive. &gt;&gt; Are you with us? &gt;&gt; And when Moses came down the mount, he saw this this wreck of human behavior. He crashed those stones. Those tables were sacrificed. Amen. to bring salvation to them because they were not ready to receive &gt;&gt; him. &gt;&gt; What happens? Moses then has to go and get the second tables of stone. &gt;&gt; Second coming of the tables. &gt;&gt; Amen. And Moses come told the people all the words of the Lord, the judgments. Uh Exodus 24:4. And Moses wrote all the words of the Lord, rose up early in the morning, builded an altar under the hill and 12 pillars according to the 12 uh u tribes of Israel. He goes up, he gets the first tablets, he comes back down. We know what happens. What happens under the second coming of the tablets? Exodus 34 1-5. The Lord said unto Moses, now the prophet is involved in the second tables of stone. Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses, he thee two tables of stone like unto the first. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; And he says, "And I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables." &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; I'm going to put what was in the first coming into the second tables of stone. Glory to God. And be ready in the morning. &gt;&gt; Come to the Mount Si. Present thyself to me on the top of the mount, &gt;&gt; the prophet, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And no man shall come with thee, &gt;&gt; neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount, neither let the flocks nor hers or anything. And what does Moses do? Moses used the two tables of stone like unto the first. And Moses rose early in the morning and went up to Mount Si, took in his hand at two tables. And the Lord descended in the cloud &gt;&gt; and stood with him there &gt;&gt; and proclaimed the name of the Lord, the new revelation. &gt;&gt; And the Lord passed before him. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And proclaimed the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, abundant. He revealed himself to him. That's right. &gt;&gt; Verse 27. And the Lord said unto Moses, "Write thou these words." &gt;&gt; It's the prophet that wrote. &gt;&gt; That's what happens in the second tables. &gt;&gt; And he was there with the Lord 40 days and 40 nights. He did neither eat bread nor drink water. He wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. And Moses whisp not that the skin of his face shone while he talked with him. Unveiling of God. What was it about? &gt;&gt; Says I can see in one hand the amount of people getting it here. He said &gt;&gt; you're not getting it. &gt;&gt; Said you see when Moses stepped in, when Moses came out, it wasn't Moses. &gt;&gt; It was only after he spoke the word, he then returned back to Moses. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was that? That's what was happening under the seventh seal &gt;&gt; in our day. A son of man revealing the son of man. &gt;&gt; That fold that was God descending. &gt;&gt; That word had to now become flesh in the people. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know the original thing was in in 2 Corinthians 3:3 uh for as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered unto us written not with ink but with the spirit of the living God not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart. &gt;&gt; That's the fullness of it all. Right? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let's move bo move over to Joshua. So all the way through the the wilderness walk, what was happening? We had this pillar of fire, pillar of cloud. We had these signs and wonders. God speaking to Moses by, you know, the vision, by the voice, by the signs and wonders and so on. When they cross over into the promised land, the prophet says the pillar of fire disappears. &gt;&gt; You don't see it anymore. Anybody had don't believe anyone who's taking pictures and saying the polarify is with them. &gt;&gt; Just stay far away from that. &gt;&gt; The polarify does not pose for pictures. &gt;&gt; If the purifier appears, there's a there's a reason and such a good reason. And let me tell you, the purifier appears with you in a picture, your life is never going to be the same. &gt;&gt; You're going to hit the ground when you stand up. You're never going to be the same. And you're not going to come out and preach some wrong doctrine after you got a picture with a pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; So stay far away from that. &gt;&gt; The type says in the promised land, the pillar of fire disappears. &gt;&gt; The prophet said the pillar of fire becomes a man &gt;&gt; in the promised land. &gt;&gt; What happens? &gt;&gt; They come out of Gilgal. They receive the the baptism of the Holy Ghost under the seventh seal. A different kind of baptism, a different kind of emotion. Amen. not the same as Pentecost. And Joshua is preparing for this great Jericho. Think of yourself. What is Jericho to me personally? &gt;&gt; I was born with strongholds &gt;&gt; in my life. Walled, cities, walls that they could run chariot races on. The enemy had so entrenched himself by my genes, my genetic codes, my cultures, my race, my traditions. He was stuck in there. There was nothing to break those things down. That's how strong and so confident was the enemy, right? &gt;&gt; Joshua comes before this. He's standing there. He's looking at this whole city. &gt;&gt; What do we do? &gt;&gt; And there he's sees a man. &gt;&gt; That plurifier becomes a man. &gt;&gt; Right. It's a man. &gt;&gt; He knows it's a man because he takes his sword. &gt;&gt; Declare, are you for us or are you against us? Right? &gt;&gt; And he says, "Nay, but as the captain of the host am I come." And Joshua would never bow down to just any man. &gt;&gt; That means he recognized in this man the lamb himself, &gt;&gt; God himself. I must submit to it. &gt;&gt; So what does this man do? I mean, he's the captain of the host. Why didn't he just send a wind and blow Jericho down? &gt;&gt; Why? He can do anything, right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Pillar of fire, open the Red Sea, &gt;&gt; stop the chariots. He can No. No. Because the third fold is about you. &gt;&gt; It's about your victory. &gt;&gt; So all that this man does, the son of man being revealed is he gives Joshua the master plan. &gt;&gt; You need a plan to break down those strongholds. &gt;&gt; And watch this master plan. It's unbelievable &gt;&gt; but believable. Amen. Glory to God. That's unbelievable for many, but for us, it is the word of God. &gt;&gt; So, we know with um with Jericho, we see these these very very thick walls. We see this um these uh these people standing on on the walls looking down. We see this this king. He's this foundation of lies, of deceit. But there's also a Rahab in there with a scholar thread waiting for something to happen. Right? So what happens is when they cross over and conquering Jericho, uh he gives them the breakdown, the master plan, right? What are the walls? Walls of sin, walls of indifference, walls of tradition, walls of doubting, walls of man-made systems. And we need a master plan for God to reveal himself to us. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; You can find this in Joshua 6:1. And it came to pass, or rather, let me just give you the the breakdown of it. Seven days it's going to take to break down this thing. &gt;&gt; Seven ages, seven messengers, seven trumpets, seven seals, hidden revelations unveiled. On the seventh day, there'll be seven manifestations, just one banging after the other, &gt;&gt; right? And on the seventh day will be the last trump. Right? I don't want to labor it, but I want to tell you. So you've got they're marching around first six days. Can you imagine those people first day all shields, swords, spears, standing on the wall, everything ready, archers, and these people are just walking, singing, blowing or just walking around the wall. After they're done, they go back to the camp, sleep it off. Next day, same story. Six days. By the third day, they were like shields down. Listen, we got this. By the sixth day, they must have been having deck chairs and cocktails. And you know, these people, these message people, my they don't know what's happening. On the seventh, the enemy's defenses became relaxed. &gt;&gt; On the seventh day, &gt;&gt; they marched around seven times. &gt;&gt; It's a massive city. seven times with about two million people. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; That's what happens. You're going to sweat it out. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They march around and this is what I want to bring you to. Here's your here's your shout voice trump. &gt;&gt; Right. You know the rest. I don't have to labor that. But I want to ask you this question. They were told to shout, but they were not told what to shout. &gt;&gt; The shout came from within them. They would just say when you hear that you shout. &gt;&gt; The mystery was in the shout because when the shout came forth the walls crumbled. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; It is all within you. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Do you love him, saints? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How about Gideon? Gideon, the sword of the Lord and of Gideon and the coming of the barley loaf. &gt;&gt; The people, you know the whole story. The fleeces. You can see the two comingings there, two fleeces. You can see uh the two water tests. You can see that happening. But let's move to the battle. Here's your Midianites. They're like grasshoppers. This is not a this is an uncommon enemy, right? &gt;&gt; Filling the valley. &gt;&gt; And the the 300, there's just so few of us, Lord, in the second coming. &gt;&gt; Everyone's against us. Everyone's left the message. There's so many defectors. There's just so few of us. And what do we have? Shout voice trump. How's this going to work? Light within an earn vessel and a trumpet. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. And something to shout, right? But still, it's a little bit unnerving, but something is happening under the seventh seal. Gideon says, "Well, let's take a walk down to the enemy camp." He walks down to where the soldiers are guarding, right where those seals are tightly bound. Something's happening. There's a man there says, "You know what? I had a dream. It's really getting to me. This weird dream. So I see this barley loaf rolling down the mountain and taking out our tents. And the other man says, "Yeah, well you know that's just a dream. Can you imagine two soldiers just talking around the fire?" Says says, "This is surely the sword of Gideon. Even the enemy has a revelation of what's happening. I'm about to be routed. this. We're feeling this. Yeah. It's unsteady. Once Gideon heard that, the confidence came in. It was revealed what the seal was, what the enemy was. It's unveiled. Break every seal out. &gt;&gt; The enemy is shaken. &gt;&gt; And then they stand and take the battle. &gt;&gt; Break the earn vessel. &gt;&gt; Let your light so shine. &gt;&gt; Blow the trumpet. Bring the shout. The enemy is destroyed. the enemy destroys itself. &gt;&gt; How about Samson? Samson, you'll see the comingings in the beginning. You'll see it with the uh the betrayal of a of a wife, then going through the the church ages. And you'll see Samson. He comes to Delilah, by the way, which means feeble. It's terrible. Someone feeble trapped him. But anyway, here's Delilah and she asks, "What is your secret? Tell me who you are. What's the secret of the coming? What's going on? And you see he he lies to her. He doesn't tell her the truth, but he's kind of like there. &gt;&gt; If you tie me with seven green widths, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Two ropes, right? &gt;&gt; Legalism, liberalism. You see what happened? Then he comes to my seven locks of hair. If you tie those things up and every time he takes out the Philistines, eventually he reveals the seven seals, right? There's it all. And what do the people do? What does the enemy do? Start taking the very thing he preached and start confounding and bringing weakness and trapping the people for several years since that happened and blinds him. puts him in this in this place where he's just uh uh uh grinding the corn, sharing it with with a donkey. But while this is happening, the hair is growing. &gt;&gt; The hair is growing. When it's finally grown, he feels the strength. But what about the seven thunders? It's no longer platted into seven. It's nothing definitive, but it's there. &gt;&gt; No one can tell you first of this, second under this. He had that seven locks, but now there's that those thunders that's going to give him strength to bring down his enemy. And he brings down the enemy with his death, with his sacrifice, with his surrender &gt;&gt; more than he did with his life. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; How about Ruth? You know the whole story of Ruth? Husband died, first coming. You are not married to the one who died. You're married to the one who resurrected. Romans chapter 4. I just want to get to this one point. She goes down to the threshing floor. Do you understand the significance of that? Boaz was shocked because this bride did something she was not supposed to do. &gt;&gt; The threshing floor was for men. If any woman came in there, she would have been seen as an elf famed woman. &gt;&gt; A woman doing something that was not right. &gt;&gt; Which is why everyone will speak against you because you're going down to the threshing floor. How dare you say you're equal to him? &gt;&gt; How dare you say you're a part? Are you trying to make yourself God? That's what you're doing by saying the bright coming of Christ. &gt;&gt; You know all of that. &gt;&gt; And she gets in there in the secret of the night. She goes down in secret in the silence and she she says, "Cover me." &gt;&gt; Cover me wasn't because she was feeling cold. &gt;&gt; That was mystery speaking. Yes. &gt;&gt; Cover meant take me as your wife, &gt;&gt; produce seed, and give me my inheritance. &gt;&gt; And Boaz understood &gt;&gt; the mystery language. &gt;&gt; Said, "The entire city knows you are a virtuous woman. You cannot leave now. Yes, lest you risk being seen. Go just at the at the dawn and I will go and do the rest." He goes into the third fold and breaks out the enemy. brings the enemy and says, "Listen, if you want to here's your your first husband of your false nature. If you want to bring seed, you've got to relinquish that life to Christ and give everything over to him." And the first that old nature says, "I'm sorry. I cannot do that. I'll risk my own inheritance. The flesh won't take it." &gt;&gt; So he says, "Then off with his shoe, throw it down." He says, "I will take it." And he relinquishes everything. The one who's resurrected brings back the inheritance to the bride and fulfills everything that was meant to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Second coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's saints. There's David and Solomon. There's so many others. Have a look at Elijah and Elisha. You know Elijah and Elisha. Elijah was the prophet. He was given three commissions. He only fulfilled one. The rest of the commission was given to Elisha. &gt;&gt; I want you to bring bring it to this point. He tells Elisha, who's a type of the bride who receives the mantle. He says to Elisha, uh, Elisha says, "How is it going to happen? How's the rapture going to take place?" What? He says, "Well, it depends on what you see. &gt;&gt; Everything depends on what you see. &gt;&gt; You'll receive the mantle if you see the right revelation. &gt;&gt; And when the time, where does it happen? Jordan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Years before there were open evidences and closed evidences in there. They crack those waters. He opens it up. The first part is done by &gt;&gt; Elijah. &gt;&gt; Elijah. &gt;&gt; They cross over. &gt;&gt; Then on the other side, the bride receives the same ability to crack it open again. &gt;&gt; He comes across. Amen. Of course, he sees said, "My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and and the horses thereof." He sees the right revelation and the mantle falls upon him. The revelation, the rapture is a revelation to the bride. She will see it. &gt;&gt; He comes over and here's all the prophets standing there. All the studious ones. He said, "Where is Elijah?" said he's he's gone. Where is his corporal body? He said, "Uh, no, you can go look if you want. You're not going to find it." They went across. &gt;&gt; I don't know how they went through their seven seal. They must have taken boats cuz they didn't have the mantle to crack it open. &gt;&gt; So they went across the seven seal however they want to. They searched and searched and searched for a physical body. They came back said, "We found none." &gt;&gt; I'm not going to elaborate on that. You should be catching that. But where was the coming of the Lord? In the man standing there with the mantle of Elijah. He goes off and completes the mystery. He anoints Jahu who will take down Jezebel the system of religion &gt;&gt; Ahab and then he he brings Haziel right the Syrian king he completes the mystery &gt;&gt; that is the part of the bride the the mystery unfolding the the the the unknown language &gt;&gt; the part that was meant for hermenise &gt;&gt; are your hearts burning &gt;&gt; and you know what happens The revelation stays with Elisha. &gt;&gt; Is that right? When the Syrians when when when those people the soldiers were surrounding the city, &gt;&gt; Elisha was relaxing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Gazi the servant said, "My Lord, &gt;&gt; we're in trouble." He said, "Lord, open his eyes. &gt;&gt; Watch this." I remember in your Sunday school kids, remember they showed you all the the the chariots of the Lord on the mountains? That's not biblical because the Bible says his eyes were open and he saw the angels of the Lord around Elisha &gt;&gt; all around the prophet. They stayed with him. That revelation stays with him. &gt;&gt; Now we see Elisha's dying. Here comes a servant coming in and my lord, you know the story. says, "Take a bow and shoot it out the window." At the deathbed, this servant says, "My Lord, my lord, my father, my father, the chariots of Israel, the revelation remains with him all the way to the end." &gt;&gt; That dimension of heaven never leaves him. &gt;&gt; Because once you see in the revelation of the rapture, it remains with you right to the very end. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let's close this down. Esther. Now, you know how many types we've already left out, right? Esther is beautiful. I was listening to the brothers talking about it. Absolutely wonderful. The glory of the bride. There's so many things in there how she was brought in. But, you know, there's a prophet Mori, right? Who tutors her, &gt;&gt; brings her up to speed, brings her to be the bride. You know, we heard about Vashi last night. Uh she forsook uh the king's commandment. Here comes the bride in. Right. And now salvation of mankind depends on her. &gt;&gt; Morai says to her, &gt;&gt; "I'm sorry. You've been having a comfortable life so far. You've been enjoying that first and second pull too much." &gt;&gt; It's time to do what you were called to do. &gt;&gt; You were called for this moment. &gt;&gt; Now, here's what happens. The king happens to be Now, you know how it works, right? There's the outside and you come in. There's a chamber where the advisor sit. There's another chamber and then there's the king's chamber. And the king was in his chamber, wait for it, for about 30 days. &gt;&gt; There was silence. &gt;&gt; Nothing was happening in the court. The rule was anybody stepped in their certain death unless the scepter was in. You know the story. She dresses in her wedding garments. &gt;&gt; She steps into silence. And here's the beautiful part. You know, I love how the way the Bible's written. He doesn't she doesn't God bless you, my king. Greetings in this in the name of the precious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And he just shouts out, "Esther, my queen. Ask anything. &gt;&gt; Third pull. &gt;&gt; Ask anything and I'll give you equality &gt;&gt; even to the half of my kingdom." &gt;&gt; She hasn't even asked anything yet. &gt;&gt; She hasn't even made a request. She steps into silence and he offers her equality. &gt;&gt; You are equal with God. All you have to do is ask for it. &gt;&gt; Hold on, my king. I want to invite you to a banquet of wine. &gt;&gt; A banquet of wine. Because under this bride dispensation, she's got to bring the enemy to the table &gt;&gt; with God. &gt;&gt; She says, "And I'd like you to bring Hmon, too." Yeah, &gt;&gt; my queen. And he leaves silence. &gt;&gt; He was sitting there with nothing happening. He was contemplating whatever he was contemplating, but he breaks the silence to come to the banquet of wine with the bride. &gt;&gt; Bring the enemy to the table. Here they are sitting there. She's speaking. She's serving them. The enemy is feeling so happy. He's got a plan in his mind because he's secretly working against the prophet Mori. He started building, you know, um, gallows. He's ready to sacrifice him on YouTube, on the internet. He's doing everything he can. &gt;&gt; He's he's going to kill this Morai. He's got a plan working and his wife is working with him, right? &gt;&gt; For sure. &gt;&gt; So, he's looking comfortable. He's enjoying himself. So, they leave. That night, the king has a troubling sleep. He wakes up. He says, "How many of you when you have a troubling sleep, you go call for all your records to be read?" &gt;&gt; Well, anyway, that's what he done. Read the records. Maybe that'll help me get some peace. And there comes the story of Mori. This man saved me from an assassination plot. What has been done for him? Well, here's what I want you to do. I want you to grab Hmon and glorify Mori before all the people. &gt;&gt; This is before the second banquet of wine that he's about to be called to. &gt;&gt; And there of course what happened. No matter what they said about him, &gt;&gt; he is glorified. &gt;&gt; Mori, &gt;&gt; and here's what happens. &gt;&gt; Beautiful, right? Calls, she calls him to a second banquet of wine. Now it's time. Now it's telling time. They're talking and then she's it's her time to speak. It's the third pull time. Now at the first banquet of wine, I I negated to tell you this. The king comes in again. They hear his greeting. As my queen, ask anything &gt;&gt; even to the half of my kingdom. From the very beginning of silence, ask anything. Third pull. Say what it is. Ask anything and you will get co-equality. that banquet. He says the same thing. The next the banquet, the second banquet of wine, he he comes in again. As the my queen, ask anything and I will give you even to the half of my kingdom. Under the second coming, he is presenting co-equality. &gt;&gt; Like brother Chad was saying last night 12 was brother Daniel 127 nations to offer co-equality. &gt;&gt; Half of his kingdom. It's a big deal. &gt;&gt; So at the second banquet of wine, she says, "My Lord, this is it. There's an enemy against our people. &gt;&gt; They're fighting against the seventh seal. They want to destroy us." He gets angry. He gets so angry, just walks out, right? And right there, she she identifies the enemy. You You are against my people. You are against Mori. you're trying to destroy me. And the the enemy bows down before the bride, &gt;&gt; pleading mercy falls on the bed. And at that time, the king walks in. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Says, "What? In my presence, you will fall down on my wife's bed." Yeah. &gt;&gt; And I like the way it says, "While the king spoke, they covered his face." &gt;&gt; Took him out, put him on the same gallows that they had rejected the prophet on &gt;&gt; and killed him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what happens thereafter? Ahazerus lays a tribute. What's a tribute? A scroll upon the land and the sea. The scriptures are perfect. Amen. &gt;&gt; He lays a tribute on the land and the sea and says everyone is subject to the message of Mori. &gt;&gt; It's all there &gt;&gt; and nothing is denominational idea of his coming. It's all there scripture by scripture. &gt;&gt; Starting with Moses, &gt;&gt; he revealed to them everything pertaining, excuse me, to himself. You go back in there and you see yourself. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; You love him, saints. &gt;&gt; In closing, the first coming of Christ is probably the greatest of all types. Amen. &gt;&gt; The greatest of all types because what you see there, I mean those who say his coming is an instant and whatever. So, the first coming was 33 and 1/2 years. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right. &gt;&gt; The first coming was &gt;&gt; The first coming was the star in Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; It was Mary the angel. It was Zechariah. &gt;&gt; It was uh um uh uh it was uh uh John the Baptist. It was turning water into wine. It was Zakius. It was blind Barnameus, the woman at the well. It was everybody. Right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; What do you see there? Is the coming an instant to everybody? &gt;&gt; Now &gt;&gt; when he came to Nathaniel, was the coming to Zakius? &gt;&gt; When he came to Zakius, was the coming to B blind bottomas? &gt;&gt; When he was blind Barameus, was the coming to the woman at the well? &gt;&gt; When the woman at the well hadn't seen the coming, did it mean he was not there? &gt;&gt; Of course, he was there. But the seventh seal has to be open to the individual. &gt;&gt; That's what happens under this mystery. &gt;&gt; Only when it's revealed to you is the coming to you. Which is why we never you don't get stuck with saying 63 February 28th. No. &gt;&gt; Of course, there's a global thing, but the coming is personal to every person who is called by the Lord Jesus Christ in this last day. &gt;&gt; Look at what happens. Here's John the Baptist. He's the prophet, right? He's standing in the water. Something is revealed to him. What is it going to be? Is it going to be my death? Is it this? Is it that? You're going to be introducing the Messiah. But what happens? He's standing there in water. He's doing what he's supposed to do. He sees the sign in the heavens. &gt;&gt; That vindicates the word. &gt;&gt; He says, "It's my Lord. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world." &gt;&gt; Then first fold. Then the Lord joins him in the water. &gt;&gt; Pro the prophet said God and his prophet becoming one there &gt;&gt; in the water in the word. &gt;&gt; Can you accept it? &gt;&gt; Can you see what happened? They're going to say the the prophet is making too much of himself. &gt;&gt; What what happens there? That's not some story. He says, "Lord, I'm not worthy of this. Me baptize you. &gt;&gt; A son of man revealing this son of man suffer it to be so." &gt;&gt; To fulfill all righteousness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ descending. God descending and then he goes out and he's left the scene and he's finding the bride &gt;&gt; individually. &gt;&gt; While the prophet is continuing &gt;&gt; and you know the prophet said and they ask why does brother still talk about the coming after the coming the coming he says you see what happened with John the Baptist the forerunner he introduced him he ends up in prison. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said he's seeing what's happening around him. You remember 64 when he said I'm It feels like I'm preaching to souls in prison. &gt;&gt; Is that the third pull? I've done this. We preached the seal. Something should have happened. Do you not see? Perhaps it's he it's in that message that he says the seven seal brings him back to earth. &gt;&gt; Feels like the last part he's preaching to souls in prison. He says uh maybe the last one has already come in. &gt;&gt; Can it be? You know this. Go read the message if you haven't. &gt;&gt; I hope it hasn't. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Here was John in prison and he said, brother Ram says in COD question and answer. He said that eagle eye got filmed over. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said he sent his his disciples to say go and ask him are you the one? &gt;&gt; Why he was anointed to be the forerunner &gt;&gt; when he was not revealing the seals in that time? when he was not Eliza, he was still a seventh messenger. &gt;&gt; The seventh messenger is always going to say, "He's coming. He's coming. He's coming." Because he was still talking to Leodysia. In one message, you see seventh messenger, &gt;&gt; Eliza, &gt;&gt; a son of man revealing the son of man. It just depends on who you are &gt;&gt; when you're reading &gt;&gt; because when you're reading, you'll have a different experience. &gt;&gt; And then he'll be Elijah. If you read it and you say, "I hate this man." Well, then you're reading as Jezebel. &gt;&gt; I can't stand him. He picks on me. &gt;&gt; And then or I don't like him. He keeps taking everything. Well, that's Ahab, &gt;&gt; right? Everything from me. He's always persecuting me. But if you're the bride, it's Eleaza. It's calling. It's a son of man revealing this son of man. Glory to God. So you can see whatever you want to see in there but the bride knows who he is. &gt;&gt; I want to close it with this one very very significant point. Amen. Few minutes. The mystery of his first coming was his death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the part that was not revealed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive. The government shall be upon his shoulder. All the prophecies in there. His coming. His coming. is coming. Remember there the the revelation they had of his coming. The prophet said he was going to be so many feet tall. He's going to have a spear a mile long and &gt;&gt; take all the Romans out and redeem Israel. Remember that. That was their revelation of his coming. &gt;&gt; Sounds very much like the fantasy the denominations have of the coming of the Lord today. &gt;&gt; The prophet said that, right? &gt;&gt; And he he came not the way they expected &gt;&gt; in humility. God hiding himself in simplicity and revealing the same. &gt;&gt; That's how he came. Amen. So here there's a mystery. He came to die. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; The Messiah. &gt;&gt; That seven thunder part of his coming &gt;&gt; they could not deal with. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It fooled everybody. They were even standing there saying, "If you are him, &gt;&gt; get yourself off the cross &gt;&gt; because we know that's what you're capable of. &gt;&gt; He willed himself to be there." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That spirit to leave him to get heaven. He had to die a man. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him, saints? &gt;&gt; That third fold. So, here's what happened. Watch the descent. He's suspended between heaven and earth at Calvary. What happens when he's suspended? It was the word exposed for the world to see. &gt;&gt; And the word says, if I be lifted up, &gt;&gt; I will draw men unto me. Right? &gt;&gt; He hung there for a space of time &gt;&gt; between heaven and earth, between two dimensions. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It was for that moment of rejection. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The world did not recognize him. &gt;&gt; He said, "It's our Lord up there." They said, "It's rocket &gt;&gt; field." &gt;&gt; The church rejected him. &gt;&gt; The elect were unsure. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Standing there. How can this be? Hiding in the crowd. Peter denying him. The man with the revelation, thou art the Christ, the son of the living God, and says, "No, no, no, no. You know, I can't really say what it is. I'm not one of them, but I believe in the coming of the Lord. turmoil inside &gt;&gt; because they don't know what to make of this. &gt;&gt; The church went through turmoil when everything started coming out. Oh yeah, it's rocket fuel. Oh, it's this. Oh, it's that. No, it can't be. And we got proof and proof and proof and pro. And the the silent church is just standing there. What's happening? What's happening? How can this be? Everyone, the the elders told us the rapture is going to take place so soon. The redemption was going to happen. What's going on? They all dispersed. The message split up. Peter goes back to nakedness on the boat &gt;&gt; fishing back to where he was called from. &gt;&gt; Everyone dispersed, separated, even the two on the way to Emmas. In the meantime, a second fold is happening. A glorious second fold. The son of man is descending further into the regions of the lost &gt;&gt; because that seven seal is about to take away the power of death in hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. They did not know what was going on as a total mystery that he would do such a thing and he would take captivity captive. &gt;&gt; He goes, I like the way the prophet says in the atunement message. He walks down the corridor. There's those that knew him, there's those that didn't. And the other one is saying that's him. That's him. That's the voice that spoke to us. That's the one that told me this. And he takes the keys of death, hell, and the grave. And he comes back up in the resurrection. All the things that happen in the resurrection is the unknown language. &gt;&gt; Remember that there's all these disciples, all the people there, and what are these two on the way to Emus said? You know, someone saw a vision of angels &gt;&gt; and told us he's here. &gt;&gt; Yes. Come on. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And we don't know what to believe. I mean, there's no quotes for it. I mean, the quotes are insufficient. And we didn't really believe them. And then the others went there and then they saw he's gone. But there's still no quote to say it &gt;&gt; outright [Applause] &gt;&gt; at the rising of the sun &gt;&gt; on the the day after the Sabbath &gt;&gt; in the bride age. Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; There's no we're not I don't know why they they're crucifying us for saying bride age. The prophet even says so. We're not in the Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; They can't accept us. There's plenty of quotes. We're not Luther. We're not Wesley. We're not in Pentecost. &gt;&gt; We're out of that. &gt;&gt; The rising of the sun in the eighth day, which is going back to the original. A mighty angel descends from heaven, cries with a loud voice. You put it all together. In Revelations 10, Roman gods traditions are struck. Blind, dead, powerless. Angel rolls away a great heavy seal. &gt;&gt; Glory. An elected woman sees him. &gt;&gt; Not as he was seen before. &gt;&gt; She's she's looking at the word. She's reading it. She's not sure what she's seeing. &gt;&gt; She says, "Have you seen my Lord?" He says, "Why seek ye the living amongst the dead? &gt;&gt; He's not there. &gt;&gt; Where is he? Please tell me where you've laid him. &gt;&gt; I'm looking for that revelation." Turns around name. &gt;&gt; Mary. &gt;&gt; Here am I. Glory to God. I'm in the right position. I know who I am. He knows who I am. He's called my name. Rabbi. &gt;&gt; That's what happens under the third fold. &gt;&gt; Who knows this? Only the elect. &gt;&gt; Does the Pharisees know it? Does the outside church know it? &gt;&gt; No. In fact, the type says the rest of the church put out a lie. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. that was purported by the disciples &gt;&gt; a false doctrine &gt;&gt; to say he's come &gt;&gt; and the lie was perpetuated &gt;&gt; you want types here it is &gt;&gt; they put out a lie to say he's come but they secretly stole his body they hatched up some revelation for themselves that's what was going on in the rest of the church but in secret &gt;&gt; every elect was being called &gt;&gt; and Everyone was having a different revelation of the coming. &gt;&gt; A personal revelation. &gt;&gt; Here am I. &gt;&gt; I'm the best father, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because that's the revelation to me. You're going to have one, too. You're also going to be the best father, but not the best father like me. You're going to be the best father like you. &gt;&gt; See? So the other one sees him, the others see him on the way to Emmas. Yeah. Then they they all sort of get gathered together by this mystery and they they get to this room. The one leaves there and he appears before Peter. Peter's naked in the boat, dives in the water, comes out and clothes himself. The coming brings him back restoration. Then they're all getting into this room and then he appears. They're afraid. What is it? Is it corporal body? Is it theophony? Where is it? starts revealing himself to them. No, it's not a ghost. It's me. &gt;&gt; Come. And then there's some doubters there who said, you know what? I'll never believe it unless I see a quote. I'll never believe it unless I feel that. &gt;&gt; All he does is discern it. &gt;&gt; Thomas, it is me. &gt;&gt; Come and feel if you want. It doesn't say he did. &gt;&gt; It just fell on his face. Lord, &gt;&gt; it is you. He saw the sign. He knew it was him. &gt;&gt; And then every other time he appears, he's there on the beach preparing fish. And they come and they're they just seen him &gt;&gt; and now they're seeing another type. How is this working? Somebody else, Brother Chad preach, somebody else preaches. Is it really him? and they go up and he speaks and they recognize him &gt;&gt; every time after the that that crucifixion, the resurrection, it's revealing himself to the individual in different ways, in manifold ways. And here's the truth of it. &gt;&gt; In his resurrection, he only revealed himself to the elect. Did they have any solid proof? &gt;&gt; No. Could they convince anybody else? No. Only a personal experience &gt;&gt; and the proof was within them. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry if you think you're going to convince everybody. &gt;&gt; It's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; The proof is within you. &gt;&gt; It is all within you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There it is. all of the seven seal in just a few selected types and shadows. &gt;&gt; Go through it yourself. I'm telling you detail, verse for verse, you will find the seven seal manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll have that experience. Did not our hearts burn within us? &gt;&gt; Go through it and tell me you don't have a burning heart. &gt;&gt; When what? When the scriptures &gt;&gt; are made known. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. They were not even saying their heart was burning when he was in the inn breaking the bread. Did not our heart burn within us when he spoke to us along the way, revealing to us the types in the shadows. The coming of the Lord was something hidden. It's a new fold we never knew before. He never revealed the time or the hour, but he has hidden it in every type and shadow of the Bible. It behooves you to go back in and walk the Emmas road and get the burning heart experience, saints of God. So now that we know all this, what now? &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You know it, you hear it, you see some of it. What now? Don't try to make it up. Don't try to force it. &gt;&gt; What does your heart tell you? &gt;&gt; You can listen to what I'm saying and you can be working things in your mind. Oh, he's saying things the prophet didn't say. or he's doing things we're not allowed to do. Who allows you to do anything? &gt;&gt; Who disallows you to do anything? &gt;&gt; You possess the gates of the enemy. You handle the opening and the closing. What you say is what he allows. What you hire is hired. What you fire is fired. You've got to accept your place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have a burning heart? &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; What do you do? Surrender. &gt;&gt; With that, brother, we can close. God bless you. Surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. As the musicians come up, let's bow our heads. Praise be to God. Dear heavenly father, how we love you, how we love your word. We give you all the praise and the glory and the honor. You alone deserve it. We've said a lot. We've been through a journey in the Bible and we appreciate your presence with us. Some of these things are a lot to digest, a lot to take in. But we realize that you called us for a purpose. You called us with a calling that this world cannot understand. And we admit there are times we were unsure. &gt;&gt; We were nervous. We had anxiety. Maybe there were times we even denied what we were seeing. Like Peter, &gt;&gt; we did not maybe want to be brave enough to associate ourselves with what you were revealing. But your eyes of grace looked upon us with compassion. You forgave us for our shortcoming, our failure, and you brought us back unto yourself by a great manifestation in these last days. Precious Lord, we thank you for what you've done under the seventh seal. We see it. We see the descent. I suppose the hardest part is to accept that it ends with me. I've been given the call to ask and receive co-equality. Father, I pray that we may receive the grace to do so, to speak the word under this third pool, to take our positions to be what we're meant to be. Bless this church, Lord, its pastor, the people, the worship, the saints of God, the people around. Bless the churches around this area. You've blessed them with such wonderful ministries and great spirit among the people. I pray Lord that you would strengthen us now to move forward into this unknown language, this glorious part that is reserved for us. Blessed be your holy name. Thank you, Lord Jesus. We commit us now to you and the rest of this day. Bless brother Daniel as he would speak tonight. Anoint him, Lord. We ask it now in Jesus precious name. Amen. And amen. All to Jesus I surrender now. All to him I freely give worldly pleasures. Oh, forsaken. Take me Jesus. Take me. I surrender. Oh, I surrender. Oh. [Music] Yes. I surrender. I surrender all. All to thee, my blessed savior. I surrender. I surrender. Yes. I surrender all the chance. I surrender all [Music] to thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all. Let's all stand. Oh, do you love the word? &gt;&gt; Is your heart on fire? Amen. As we walked through the scriptures and saw our day, &gt;&gt; ourselves, our position, our story. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, I discussed with somebody one time, I think we were talking with brother Alistister, where is the seventh seal? I said, this is the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; It's the record of the seventh seal. The whole Bible is the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's in every shadow and type. And I just want to read one more scripture. So, I don't want to add to anything the brother said, but this is just burning in me. If we could go to Luke 24 together, I just want to read one more thing cuz it's so precious to me. And we'll read the verse that Brother Alistister had us read in verse 32. Luke 24:32. And they said one to another, "Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way? And while he opened to us the scriptures?" &gt;&gt; Who opened the scriptures? He opened the scriptures &gt;&gt; to us. &gt;&gt; But then they go and they run back and they tell the rest of the disciples the story and there's still some questions and Peter's seen him and they're gathered together and then he miraculously appears in their midst. &gt;&gt; And in verse 44 he says, "And he said unto them, these are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms concerning me." Then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. When he was here through the prophet, he was opening up the scriptures. Amen. But when he comes in their midst, Amen. He gives them the understanding to understand the scriptures. Amen. That's why our brother could see the types and shadows. This whole Bible was written for our day. Amen. It's all a revelation of today. And I say, God, that prophet, through that prophet, you opened up the scriptures. But when you come in our midst, give us understanding to understand the scriptures that you've given to us. Oh, praise God. Then every time you read your Bible, your heart will burn. Amen. &gt;&gt; As he opens to you the word. &gt;&gt; What a day we live in, friends. Just want to say I feel like the most privileged person on the face of the earth to hear the things that we get to hear. &gt;&gt; Many prophets and wise men of old have longed to see your day. &gt;&gt; But here we are. &gt;&gt; We're the ones he chose. Let us never take it for granted. Let us never take it lightly. May it be more than life to us always. And God bless you. We love you. Amen. We'll welcome you back this afternoon, this evening. We have service at 6:30 p.m. Also want to remind you the youth that'll be gathering at the Bible believer school gym immediately after this service. And man, God bless you. We love you all. I love I love when he makes his presence known &gt;&gt; by breaking bread. &gt;&gt; He sat at the head of the table and he broke the bread and brother said he must have done something like he did it before. &gt;&gt; What did he do before in that ministry? Amen. and he broke the bread and we begin to see, amen, he was breaking the word of life. Amen. For them. And now he comes and he does something like he did before. This morning he did something like he's done before when he broke the word and broke the bread of life and gave it out to us and we say that wasn't brother Aleister. That was my Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love it when he makes his presence known &gt;&gt; and our eyes open and we see him. &gt;&gt; God is good. Amen. So say we love you. May God bless you. Let's just bow our heads in thanking. Lord Jesus, we thank you for your word, God. There's so many different ways we can express it and so many different sermons that can be preached, so many different types and shadows and angles, but it's all pointing to the same thing. That you are the great one among us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you've had a plan from before the foundation of the world. And you desire, Lord, to bring the understanding of that plan to your bride. You want to reveal yourself to her. And you want to reveal who she is to her so that you can be united with her. God, there's all kinds of gifts and ways of presenting and ways of seeing and types and and scriptures. We could we could preach it from every angle, but it's all the same thing. You're here to unite with your bride. You're here unveiling yourself to your bride and unveiling who she is so that she can have the freedom to unite with you. Oh God, how wonderful you are, how precious you are, how thankful we are for the hour you've allowed us to live, God, when the world calls it a dark time, it's the brightest light that has ever shined and it's shining in our hearts right now. &gt;&gt; We're so grateful, Lord. pray that you bless us as we depart, Lord, and keep us safe. And Lord, by your will, bring us back this evening for the service. We love you and we thank you for all you've done and all you're doing and all that you will do in our lives. &gt;&gt; We ask your blessing in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Lord. All to Jesus. I surrender now. I feel that sacred flame. Oh, the joy of full salvation. Gloryy, gloryy to his name. And I surrender all. Oh, I surrender all.

He's my all in it all. He's the great creator. He became my savior and all God's fullness dwell in him. All together now. Oh, how I love. Oh, how we love you, Lord. I adore you. Oh my breath, my sunshine. You're my all in all. The great creator became my savior and all God's fullness [Music] dwelling in him. [Music] So I'm going to rise higher every day.
