TRANSCRIPT
========================================
How was your sunship given to you? By predestination. How is it? How was our inheritance given to us? Through what? Predestination. Predestination is fornowledge. That how did God know he could trust you to be a preacher? His fornowledge. Not he that willth or runth. It's God that showeth mercy. That's right. Predestination. He knew what was in you. He knew what was in you before you come to the earth. There's our story of God and man. He know what was in you before there was ever a earth for you to come on. &gt;&gt; That's him. That's the infinite God. The infinite. We're finite. We can only think finite saints. Predestination by fornowledge. We're closing. Sunship was given to us to the elect by predestination. That was his plan for you. That that had to be revealed to you. You have no way of working that out yourself. Do you agree? Right? God could see by fornowledge what character you were supposed to have. You would never have known. You don't even know what what to do tomorrow. So he he predestinated you for a purpose and led you while you were not aware that he was leading you to an earth an earthly uh inheritance that could lead us to that sunship and make sure that we actually get it. Are you with us? By forn knowledge, he could make the prophet a preacher or you a teacher or a mechanic or uh like a uh a carpenter or something or the other. He could make you into something, right? They were all uh by fornowledge he could make you into something. He could put into you an attribute that could lead you to become something you would never have thought could even lead you to a place where there is an earthly vocation for you like an like an earthly uh career or an earthly uh position in life that would be suitable to the purpose of a son of God. [clears throat] Is that right? You know because of that attribute within you, you're not going to choose something to be in this life that will contradict sunship. &gt;&gt; This is why there's such a a pressure on us as as people to not become something that will contradict God's word. Amen. And Abraham was looking for a city whose builder and maker was God according to Hebrews 11. Is that right? And they were all looking for something earthy because there was some earthly reward. And yet they all realized though they had attained Abraham received Isaac but was not satisfied. He received that promise but he realized there was something heavenly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; David uh received the throne and then said but I want to build you a house. &gt;&gt; There's something more. Solomon did it and then there's something more and every time they had achieved their purpose on earth they degenerated into something and lost their testimonies became something else and got into idolatry and there was something more they were looking to and did not attain. Our inheritance in heaven is our theophanes and that gives us our sunship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sunship is our heavenly relationship to God and the father is ah as his sons that entitles us to our earthly inheritance. Amen. So putting it plainly, your earthly inheritance one day is a glorified body, &gt;&gt; a body that will live on earth for eternity. &gt;&gt; But you cannot get that without becoming sun first. You cannot get that without receiving adoption because you can only take over the earthly inheritance if you have the title deed. &gt;&gt; To get the title deed, you have to become a son. To become a son, you need the spirit of adoption. You need spoken word. You need to overcome this by spoken word. Then you receive adoption. That's receiving full sunship. That's receiving earthly inheritance. That's the road to adoption. &gt;&gt; That's what that's why we are here. Look at where we are in that plan. Christ came 2,000 years ago. The baptism of the Holy Ghost came 2,000 years ago. Where are we right now? We are so FAR AHEAD, SO FAR ALONG. We are right here at the end where adoption is at the brink. &gt;&gt; We are at the time where the rapture is promised. We are at the time where theophanes have to be revealed to each son of God. Where all THOSE THAT WERE DEAD SHALL BE CHANGED AND THOSE that are living shall be changed. For what purpose? Once we have all fully received sunship, it is time to take the earthly inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then what happens when we receive sunship while we're at the marriage supper? Our earthly inheritance is taken away from the enemy who has been squatting on it for a long time. and it is purged for our purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. So in closing, rejoice and be exceeding glad. That is rapture. For what reason? For great is your reward in heaven. For so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Great is your reward in heaven. This is more than just a fantasy. It's more than just a story of one day I'll make it to heaven because I accepted Christ. Your reward in heaven, your adoption, your sunship, who you are, your name revealed, the right to life, the right to the earth. Great is your reward in heaven. Rejoice and be exceeding glad. This is the time for rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads together.
