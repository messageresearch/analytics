TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. While you're standing, we like to read in our Bibles. And we like to read from John chapter 21, the Gospel John 21 15-17. And then we'll also read Luke 22 24-32. So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He said unto him, Yay, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee? He saith unto him, Feed my lambs? He saith to him again the second time, Simon son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yay, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, "Feed my sheep." He said unto him the third time, "Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me?" Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, "Lovest thou me?" And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things. Thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus sith unto him, feed my sheep. Amen. Luke 22 verse 24-32. I want you to bear um real um uh notice to this scripture because this is where we're going to be taking our text from. And there was also strife among them. Which of them should be accounted the greatest? &gt;&gt; That's the disciples. And he said unto them, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. But you shall not be so. But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitth at meat or he that serveth? Is not he that siteth at meat? But I am among you as he that serveth. You are they which have continued with me in my temptations, and I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father hath appointed unto me, that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel. And the Lord said,"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee, that thy failed not, and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren." &gt;&gt; The Lord add a blessing to his word. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Amen. We'd like to greet you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Certainly good to be uh with you this morning once again and good to be in the house of the Lord and uh sharing God's word and uh I just want to say you know I it's it's been a really difficult week. It's been like uh you know a lot of things we had to do uh counseling and you know studying and getting things together. You you cannot imagine what kind of a time it's been. So, I'm also getting a lot of questions um from people, but uh I don't get to, you know, read the uh comments and the questions that come up on all the YouTube videos now that things are on YouTube and and so the brothers, some of the brothers send the questions to me and I I don't get to do all the questions or answer all the questions and I cannot most of the time I I don't get to um uh know who the people are who are asking questions. that are the comments that are there in the YouTube videos. So, honestly, if I had to take time to read all the stuff, I just wouldn't have time for the work that I have to do. So um but it's quite something to see the um the questions in the hearts of the people and it's so amazing because we've been through all these questions in our question and answer services and I can see it just happening now coming up again in the rest of the world in the message and it's quite incredible that these things are being revived and people's hearts are really searching for the truth. of course with um you know, we know with putting ourselves out there and on the internet, it looks like that's what it's it's going to become now. And um uh we're going to face a lot of battles. We're going to face a lot of criticism, a lot of people coming against you. This is just what it's going to be. And uh if we thought that we're going to sail through this message without criticism, without people speaking against you, coming against your family, you know, then we were we never we signed up for the wrong thing. &gt;&gt; And uh to think that you're in this message and you say you're a follower of Christ and everybody must like you is another crazy thought. you as long as you are speaking the truth, you are going to be rejected by the by the many by the majority and and um that's just the one thing that you always know. I was talking to my family this week and and saying to to my wife as well, you know, when when you tell the truth, uh it's it's not difficult. And I I was saying, you know, people hate this message. People rebel against this message. And and uh and and like what's really the problem? Like what is it that the message is telling you this not true? Like why don't they like the message? It's the truth that you should not smoke. You should not drink. It's the truth you should not do drugs. It's the truth you should you should dress respectfully. It's a truth for a woman that you should not dress seductively. You outside you you're you're married to a man and you should not be attracting the attention of another man deliberately. &gt;&gt; It's the truth. It's the truth that you should uh uh obey the Bible, the word of the Lord. It's everything the message tells you is actually the truth. And that's the part people reject. Why? Because they don't like the truth. Because the truth confronts you. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The truth makes you act. The truth makes you um you know uh um you you cannot unsee it once you've seen it. &gt;&gt; And it's incredible. You know, I I had a chuckle, you know, speaking about the the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and uh in the last few um months and um to to see the struggle in people because once you've heard it, you can't unhear it. Now when you're speaking, you're conscious to say Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit. And it's so amazing to see this happening that uh and yet we've been speaking about this for a long time and we're free of that. We're not even conscious of it. We just know what it is and we have no issue with it. But now to watch people struggle to to to see, you know, what is it that I'm going to say right now? What which word do I use right now? And that's not what it was meant to be. You just need to know that you're speaking about the person and you're speaking about the anointing. Two different things. Like uh if if I die, you've just lost the person, but my anointing can still remain. &gt;&gt; People will still remember the words that the actions that I did. They would people would want to live by. I'm not speaking about me personally. I'm speaking about a person like Christ. Um he died, he left, but the anointing of him still remained. Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so you could live by that anointing or you can live by that person. The word of that person is that person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So it's really a wonderful thing and we appreciate the Lord. Um and uh there's many trials of the saints um occurring right now. Many people, many true ministers are facing a lot of uh onslaught all over the world and churches are finding it difficult. There are lots of people falling away from the word. It's really really you know tragedy but we're trusting the Lord because he knows all things and he knows that this time would be. So I must say I appreciate um brother Sep reading that psalm this morning and and his prayer. You know you're you're you're studying you're wondering which direction God sends you in. You're following this up. You're, you know, having conversations in the week. You're reading things. You're going to territories you haven't been before. And then, um, you haven't spoken to anyone, and then here comes a brother, reads a psalm, prays the prayer, and everything in there is exactly what you're going to talk about. So, we appreciate the Lord. Amen. So, um, uh, our title, um, in our subject is begotten, born, and then converted. This is going to be part two and uh our title is going to be strengthening your brethren or strengthen your brethren. Amen. So I thought I'm thinking you know this is this is a good thing that that can be a short service you know because we need to keep it short. So uh I hope it's going to be that because I mean how much can you talk about strengthening your brethren? thought was in my mind, how are we going to work this out? But uh so last week after the service, I was speaking to some of the brothers and I was asked, you know, brother, you need to kind of flesh this out a little bit more. You know, what what the meaning of conversion is. We can understand begotten, we can understand being born. Um conversion, you need to flesh it out. You need to speak more about that. We need to make this a little bit more relatable to the people, even the young people and the children. uh everyone like we spoke about you know when you are converted you come into purpose and so on everyone comes to church but not everyone can have a position in the church if everyone has a position there's nobody to serve so it's it's like when we're talking about purpose in the church it's it's like brother Al what can everyone do everyone have to have some kind of position to take uh what do the sisters do you know what do the youth do what is there for the youth some of them can handle this and than that, you know, the the technology, the sound, and and the rest of them are don't have anything to do. It looks like there's not enough positions in a church. Even if you have a,000 people, 6,000 people, you cannot have all 6,000 people having a position in the church. &gt;&gt; It just it just doesn't uh make sense. There there's got to be people who we are serving, right? So the questions are like what are there for the parents of young children to do? You have young children you know it's like you're preaching brother Allan we need purpose we need to do things we need to be active but right now we've got children to take care of we've got young children you know what can we do in the church where we can now neglect those children now to go and fulfill some duties. What is there for the old people to do? We've we've been through church for four decades and we've we've done so much for the gospel and now we're we're we're older. What are we supposed to be doing? And we all agree that it's true that we we can identify our experience by when we were begotten of the Lord, when we were born again. But conversion remains a bit vague and not completely comprehendable. Like we don't really understand, we can't comprehend exactly from what we spoken about in conversion. We understand what begotten means when the Lord was seeking us and the gene seed was planted and we went through life and then we the born again experience we can understand that. But being converted uh what does that mean? Right? So we discussed um many things and uh spoke for a while and then we had a we went home. We had a conversation with our sons as well. I think we spoke till like midnight last Sunday just discussing the service and we discussed many things but one of the things we looked at and this is what I want to take as a kind of introduction to this. One of the things we looked at was predestination and we were discussing why so many people struggle with the concept of predestination. And the reason people resist the concept of predestination is because it has been portrayed incorrectly to people. &gt;&gt; Right? And people have um people in the message have developed this idea of predestination as if it is like eliteness, you know, like we have been chosen and um we have been chosen above others because we are special or because God chose us above others to make it to heaven. So when you have that, you give that impression to other people, to outsiders, to unbelievers, to your family members, and you you give them this impression. Well, I am elite. I am chosen. God chose me. God chose me to do what? To be what? And the usual thought with me people is that God has chosen us above to save us so that we might go to heaven. That is really juvenile. There's no other way to say that. I, you know, I told my sons, if people truly understood the predestination and you're in your right minds, you'd never want it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You'd never ask for it if you only know what it entails. &gt;&gt; And the the example I gave them was Christ was predestinated to suffer Calvary and die. He was chosen. That body was chosen for that purpose, right? And we'll have a look at that. Uh all other sons of God through the Bible. The word predestination does not even occur in the Bible. Only the word predestinate and predestinated. But when you look at the words, if people would study it closely, you'd actually find the Bible is so specific. It said you are predestinated unto something or you to predestinate you to something. It never says you are predestinated to be saved to go to heaven. &gt;&gt; Not one place. If anything once again people confused the words of the prophet because they don't take the time to understand the context of what the prophet is saying. Like for example, in some places he says you are predestinated unto eternal life. When you look at that, you think predestinated unto? Oh, okay. So, I've been chosen to go to heaven. I've been chosen by God to live forever. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Eternal life has a responsibility. Eternal life has a purpose, right? Nowhere does it say you are predestinated to go to heaven or predestinated to go to hell. As if in other you know what you're saying when you say predestinated it basically means you have no choice. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it means God chose you. And whether you try, think of this, if this is God, that if a human tries so hard to live righteously, to be good, to do the right thing because God didn't choose him, he's going to hell and he's eternally lost. Think of that if that is God's nature, right? In likewise, when you say I'm predestinated to go to heaven, the Calvinistic approach is no matter what I do, no matter how I live, no how no matter how irresponsible I am, no matter how much I sin, no matter how much I think terrible things and cheat and fraud and steal and be immoral because God chose me, I'm his child. I'll be in heaven. That's the problem. So when when people hear you say those things, they think you're mad &gt;&gt; and they might be right if you say it that way. The prophet then says we must find the balance with predestination. He said in marriage and divorce there are two schools of thought and they both run out on a limb like the like the tree trunk is here and the branches go out and as the branch go out it goes from thick to thin. So if you run out on a limb and you keep running you reach the end of the branch and then you fall off or it gets so thin it breaks. &gt;&gt; He says that's what that's what he means by you're running out on a limb. So he says there were uh I spoke of it more specifically Paul also mentions it in Romans and Ephesians. So I want to read from the first quote from serpent seed um page 10 paragraph one. He said now how did it ever start? We'll have to hurry and get it get to it just as quickly as possible. How it ever started? Now we got plenty of scriptures wrote out here about the Holy Ghost. And another thing we made a challenge last night on the pier perseverance of the saints. Not in the way the Baptist believe it. No, sir. All right, here it is. I sure differ or I differ with the Baptists and their idea of their theory of Calvinism. I certainly disagree with the Presbyterian. I disagree with the Methodist upon their way of Armenian. In other words, the two ways of predestination, I disagree with both sides. In other words, like what I mentioned, I'm saved. I'm chosen. I'm on my way to heaven. I can live however I want to. The other side, I can try as hard as I can. I'm never going to make it. Right? Uh an Armenian side is you have to work hard to make it. It's all got to do with your works. So one side is Calvinism. I don't have to work. The other side is I have to do all the works and if I don't make it sufficiently, I won't make it. Brother said, I don't agree with both sides. Yes, sir. But they they both got a truth. Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you got to bring it back here where it is true. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you run out there, you run wild with it. Certainly. So predestination is exactly what it sounds like. Predestination [Music] means your destination is predetermined. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? Destination is predetermined or there is a predetermined outcome. The problem is making the destination heaven. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Nobody said that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not even the Bible. &gt;&gt; The destination in the Bible is adoption of sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; See, so there has to be a destination. There has to be an outcome. The outcome is predetermined, not the path. It means you have been chosen by God to achieve something for him. God has predetermined it that you will do it. How you do it, how long it takes depends on your choices. But he is going to make sure by whatever means to help you get there. He's going to assist you to get there. That's what predestination actually is. A lot of it doesn't immediately make sense, but we'll show it to you. Let's go to Romans 8 29-30 firstly, and then after we done with this, then we'll see how many of you are whooping and screaming to be predestinated. For whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son. If I was a nice evangelist, I'd be saying glory to God. Predestinated to the image of his son, glorious image that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Nobody's thinking past and deeper into this. Verse 30. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified. And whom he justified, them he also glorified. What is the destination? What is the outcome? What is the predetermined outcome? The predetermined outcome in this scripture is that you are conformed to the image of Christ. What's the next question? What is the image of Christ? If the outcome is the image of Christ and I am predestinated to the image of Christ, I am predestinated to get to the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; there's a path to that. That's the outcome. My outcome has been predetermined by God by his fornowledge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what is the image of Christ? What does that mean? It looks so glorious when you heard and the evangelists will go, he wants us to be like him. Glory. Hallelujah. He wants you to be perfect, kind, gentle, loving, heavenly, and living forever. Somebody say, "Amen." Let's have church in here right now. No. The image of Christ is to experience his experience. That he might be the firstborn among many brethren. That he will be the firstborn, the beginner of many who will be like him. &gt;&gt; Yes. And what is that? The image of Isan is to be selfless, to live for the salvation of others, to suffer persecution, to suffer turmoil, to give up things that you would like for the sake of others and suffer the turmoil and possibly death and destruction for the purpose of God. Now, how many want it? All the saints of the ages were chosen and they fulfilled this. They bore their cross. To be conformed to the image of Christ means to have a cross of your own to carry someday or through your life. You are predestinated to that. How many glory hallelujah will you hear being shouted and screamed when that is the reality you are confronted with now you won't go around the world bragging I'm predestinated I'm chosen I'm elect if you only knew what it is in your right mind you wouldn't want it because it's logical not to want this all the saints of the ages did he told told them it would be their purpose. Didn't Christ tell them? He said, "I came to put a sword among you. Because of me, your family will be divided. &gt;&gt; There will be a sword between father and son, between mother and daughter." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "Because of my sake, you will be tried. You will be scourged. You will be given to death. You will be you will be given to tribulation by the leaders around you. Be for my sake. you will suffer persecution. He had told them. He didn't say, "Don't worry. Let's go sing it. It's a highway to heaven. None shall walk up there but the pure in heart." Oh, we love that song, but we know what it means when we sing it, &gt;&gt; right? Verse 30 links predestination to calling. Do you know what calling means in the Bible? Calling means to be named. What is to be named? Ephesians 4:1 says is uh uh links calling to vocation. What is vocation? Right? To be named means to be given a particular vocation. To be named means to be given a particular purpose. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So just being given some random gift of the Holy Ghost is not what this is. &gt;&gt; Just cuz when you came when you were born again and you receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, maybe it was speaking with tongues. That's not your name. &gt;&gt; That's not what you were called to do. What is your name? Right? Just being given random positions in the church or positions in uh the message kingdom if you want to call it. I don't know. Named called has got to do with purpose and vocation. Let's go to Ephesians 1:5. This this these are the the only scriptures, four scriptures, four places that predestinated or predestinate is mentioned. Ephesians 15. And he can only say this to the Ephesian church. having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself. That's already telling you you are not a child of God. This person you are born of flesh and blood, but you were adopted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; By the new birth &gt;&gt; to be the word made flesh for your day. For what reason? No random reason like God looked down and said, "Oh, I like this guy cuz he likes me. Let's take him." Adoption of children. What is adoption about? A son coming to maturity to take over the father's business. &gt;&gt; That's what your outcome is. &gt;&gt; Why are we thinking your outcome is heaven? &gt;&gt; Are we going to do it heaven? Just to come back here. Heaven is only like where we fuel up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Just to come back here. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; To fulfill the outcome that we were chosen for. This tells you you are predestinated. Your destination that was predetermined is the adoption of children. So when Christ stood on Mount Transfiguration in Matthew 17 and the adoption of Christ was recognized and the adoption is a son being recognized by the father and made a spectacle of to the public to say this is the one whom I've chosen. Like when Peter and James and John, they're standing there and saying, "Let's build a tabernacle to Moses and Elijah." And he says the word of God came and said, "Not them. This is my beloved son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. He is glorified. Only one altar." That's making a spectacle. What was a spectacle for? He is the one chosen. And what was he chosen for? To suffer and die for the salvation of mankind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But first before you come to the adoption of children, what is the adoption of children? Children must not remain children. You must come up to the adoption which is maturity of children. Right? So you are predetermined. You are predestinated. The process of adoption is bringing you to maturity. If you were not chosen, you would never be mature. You would still be that grubbling loser &gt;&gt; who couldn't handle his life or her life out there in the world who would end up just like everyone else in this world waiting for the end of the day to get into some kind of of a drug or entertainment to take away your misery. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yet you have been chosen by God to come to the maturity of sons of God for a particular purpose. And then this process of adoption is not a path of ease and soft living. Right? Nobody promised it's going to be an easy ride. uh you know if it were an easy life it wouldn't say according to the good pleasure of his will. People read that and think oh yes God's pleasure you know when you read that you don't see the discomfort in there's a lot of discomfort in there. The fact that he told you what you are about to go through is for the good pleasure of his will should frighten you. This is telling you that things are not going to go the way you like it &gt;&gt; and you have been chosen for that. &gt;&gt; You know, um I'm going to go through that in a little while and then we're going to have this uh you know this this this realization. Let's go to Ephesians 1:11. in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him. So there's the last place predestinated is used and once again it's telling you you are predestinated according to the purpose. Predestination is linked to purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's linked to calling. It's linked to vocation. It's linked. You're not predestinated to heaven or the outcome of your of of your life. You becoming an angel someday and being so happy and I I can't even imagine. I can't even describe that because to me that is so not real. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Listen, heaven was a place where the angels had free will and a whole bunch of them were deceived. So what's your idea of heaven? &gt;&gt; See this this Greek mythology and Roman mythology of there in the clouds and stars and the skies and you know all of us standing there and singing. &gt;&gt; I don't understand this this idea of heaven and harps playing and you know people all singing and worshiping like uh like they are all have this this group delusion. They've been drugged by God to just say nice things and worship and bow down. And can you imagine if if if it even was a three and a half year wedding feast and all we were doing was just standing and bowing down every single moment singing songs. &gt;&gt; Do you really think that's heaven? Th this is the point for the life of me. people who have received the open book and the message of the hour from this prophet to go back to the delusions of denominational people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; To think to have those imaginations of heaven is beyond me. I don't understand how you got to that as a reality of what heaven is. Even hell, hell to them is this, you know, dark place with like fire burning everywhere. People running and screaming and and devils chasing them, laughing. you know, with a fork and poking them and moving them into caves of fire and really I don't understand how when you have a reality, you can't understand the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So why would I say it's not something you would desire? Some of you, you know, extremely overrighteous people, you know, of course, brother, I I will lay down my life for Christ. I will I will do anything, you know. I will do everything for him. He's called me. I will I know you're lying because I've got hundreds of witnesses who are proof in the Bible, right? Just look at all the characters of the Bible and you identify their begotten, born, and converted stages. Let's start with number one, which is Noah. Noah is living in a day where there's uh no church, no Bible, no books, whatever. Noah, all he wants in life is to have his wife and children and take care of his farming and feed his family. There's no religion for him to follow. What does he care what the world is doing? Let them destroy themselves. Well, I'm living my life according to God. That's like some of you are thinking right now today. &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't need to be involved with other people's. Listen, if they want to live that, let them go and kill themselves. What do I care? Why must I be the one chosen to save mankind? You know, I mean, they they choosing that life. They want to do that. They want to drink. They want to smoke. They want to curse. They want to dress like that. They want to live that way. Let them do it. That's you. It's in their heart. And God says, "No, I want to save mankind. And I've chosen you. And for the next 120 years, you will build me an ark. You with your three sons, no one else is going to help you. You will pull the logs. You will chop them down. You will drag them. You will nail them in. You will find the pit. For 120 years, you will do this. I have chosen you. Tell me. He woke up every day, had his coffee, and said, "Let's get to work, boys. This is going to be fantastic for the glory of God and the salvation of mankind. We're all so happy. Let's have family alter." And thank God for this choosing. &gt;&gt; Sure. Yet you tell it as Bible stories and Sunday school stories. &gt;&gt; How about Abraham living in the Chaldes peacefully married his wife Sarai? Abram married Sarai living in one of the richest spots on earth. richest spots of the Chaldises of Mesopotamia, the the hub of uh of of life in in that part of the world, the first place of civilization, the place where there was writing and cities and fashion and and uh um um building of of of things that I mean this would have been the Hollywood of the world. And God tells him, "I have chosen you. Leave your family. Leave your father's house. Leave everyone behind. Take take Sarah, your wife, and go to a place you've never been before where it's riddled with venerial disease. Total idiots, people who don't know God. Go there, and I will make of you a great nation. Knowing that both you and your wife are barren &gt;&gt; that I have chosen you for this. No signs, no pillar of fire, no scriptures, no prophets. He heard a voice. So what? Abraham packs up his house, leaves his business. How many of you will do that? leaves his business, uh, starts moving to another city. He's got no GPS. He's got no cars. He's got no trucks, camels locked and loaded. And then he's moving. And his dad comes, "Where do you think you're going? You are my oldest son. You are my heir. You are the heir of my inheritance. Where do you think you're going, Dad? I got to do this. God called me. God called you? Which God? You know, was it that gold one, that silver one? The wooden one, the stone one, which one was it? Tell me, I'll break him. I heard a voice. Tell me for the next hundred years or if he lived however long Abraham lived that he was thinking in his mind, this is the most glorious life I could have chosen for myself. And then of course his nephew Lot comes along with him who is a total pain in the neck. Never is grateful for anything. Always wants more. Always wants to piggy back of Abram's blessing. And it's just, you know, you get some of the relatives that are always there. You can't get rid of them. They just got a piggyback of your blessing. That's all. All they want is want, want, want, want, and they give nothing. Yeah. That's who Lot wants. got the right name too. H take a lot and give nothing. Eventually, Abram even has to try and save him. The guy goes to Sodom and Gomorrah and Abram has to save him, but Abram is chosen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How about Jacob? This guy probably wish he never got that birthright. Hey, he fought for something inside him. That was that begotten stage. Hey, makes him cheat his brother out of the birthright. Goes and gets the blessing. His mother was was was telling him this is the right thing to do and preaching to him and whatever. And he did it and then is running for his life the rest of his life. And then as to come back to take his position, God chose him to bring the 12 tribes of Israel &gt;&gt; who would save the world by the Levitical order. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did that man at that time ever know his great purpose? &gt;&gt; The guy gets tricked out. He wants to marry this woman. He falls in love with Rachel. He gets tricked because at that time the the wife is given to you with a veil over it. You go and take her into the tent. Then you lift the veil and then for the glory of God, he still has to bear with this and then work another seven years for a wife that he actually was in love with. And then bring forth the Joseph, the next son who is chosen. This one glorious life, seven color cloak. Gloria, glory, hallelujah. Gets thrown in the pit for three days. &gt;&gt; Gets sold as a slave to Egypt. &gt;&gt; Gets taken by Pifa. Gets thrown in prison. This is the predestinated life. &gt;&gt; Only to come out to save the world from famine cuz God foresaw it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; How about Moses? Hey, this this this fella gets to live in a palace. Perfect life. Why would he want to leave there? Go to a desert, live like a bedin. How many of you would do that? How many of you would give up your wonderful life in your plush suburb where you live to go and live in a desert like a bedin for the sake of God? You all shout it. You all sing about it. You all sing specials at conventions and combines and everything, but ask you one day to give up one thing &gt;&gt; for the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Then brag to me about your predestination. Amen. &gt;&gt; How about Ruth? H Ruth, this woman was a Moabitis. She was uh rejected or persecuted by the Hebrews. She then is married to a Hebrew who was backsliden of all things. Then he dies. Then by the law, she has to follow the mother-in-law. Goes back to that. And then she has to go and uh do something that's going to put her life in danger. go and sleep on the threshing floor at the feet of Boaz in the hope that she will do the right thing for the lever law to be enacted again so that the inheritance would come back to Naomi. She has to go and do that for Naomi not knowing her purposes to bring forth &gt;&gt; David. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring forth the lineage of David. All she had to go through. This was her predestination. This was her outcome that God had predetermined when it started. Did she have any clue? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; What did God know? What did God see by foreign knowledge? That this girl's heart would say, "Where you go, I will go. Where you lodge, I will lodge. &gt;&gt; Your God shall be my God. Your people shall be my people." God by fornowledge saw her character and predestinated her outcome. The outcome was glorious. The path was difficult. &gt;&gt; How about Rahab? She was a harlot. She was known to be a harlot. She would have been unworthy. Every single person would have spoken against her. The king sent his men to see that this is where these spies would have been hiding. But this woman is chosen of God again to be part of the lineage of David. Lastly, David. David is a shepherd. Um, taking care of sheep. Smell like them. Last born of the family. The runt. Is that right? Even his brothers scoffed, laughed when Samuel chose him. His own father said, "The prophet, I think you made a mistake. It can't be him. Surely look at my other sons. They're more impressive. They're in the army. You must have made a mistake. No, not a mistake. He's the one chosen from the time he was anointed with oil. Anointed with oil, right? Are you seeing begotten born? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He knew what he's being anointed for. He's being anointed by the prophet to be the king of Israel. Right? Every day your regular message person will come on. I have been anointed. Hallelujah. Holy Ghost oil poured on me. Glory to God. I'm living in my purpose. He's running for his life. For the majority part of David's life, he's running. Everything he does is not pleasing this king. Everything he does is turning into disaster. And then he becomes king. God establishes his his kingdom. And the first thing that happens when he gets on his throne is commits adultery and murder. What is his purpose? To produce Solomon. Solomon will build the temple. Solomon will restore the the worship back to Israel. Bring peace. The same man with all the troubles. Look at the troubles he went through. His family got torn apart. He lost some of his sons. Most of his sons. Some of them backslid. Some of them were unrighteous. Some of them kill the other one. How about that for a predestinated son of God? H flashy lifestyle. No. So notice how each one is made aware of the presence of God, the turmoil they go through, and the effort to resist. Can you see how many times you look at all these people? This I just chose eight. Look at how many times they doubted they were actually would have chosen a different way. Even Abraham listened to Sarah and thought, "Yeah, well maybe uh Hagga might be the right way. He made a mistake and God went along with that mistake and had to bless that fellow too." Notice the turmoil receiving a call. God knew you would accept the call. You had no You had no idea why you accepted the call, but you accept it. Look at how it clashes with your own will. Then you try to insert your will into his. Do we see it there? &gt;&gt; Yes. And look at the trouble we get into because of trying to insert our own will into God's purpose. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then you can see how many of them went through backslidiveness when they had uh felt they had no more purpose. Look at Noah. Noah comes out on the end of the flood. His purpose is over. 120 years. Builds the ark. Uh goes through that flood. Awful time. Does everything God tells him. Comes out on the other side and becomes a drunken. This is important because this is kind of what happens when you feel your purpose has ended and when things grow cold and you're not sure what your life is supposed to be in the message. This is what happens. You go into backslideness. All right. And then there is another kind of predestination. It's a bad predestination. Do you know that? Yeah. These are those who are predestinated to destruction like Esau, Pharaoh, and Judas. They are predestinated. In other words, their outcome has been predetermined by God. What does it mean God made them evil? No. God knew they were evil and knew he could use them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were born evil. These people are chosen by God, predestinated to bring about a certain result. Their destination is predetermined to be destruction. Anyone hearing that thinks this is so unfair? Why would God do that to a person? The the difference is these people enjoyed their lives as compared to those other eight we showed you and the many others. Pharaoh, Esau, Judas, they enjoyed their lives. They were enjoying their evil ways. You know that. And it led to destruction. They were a lot of these people in the times of the believers. These people that were predestinated to destruction. They were powerful. They were rich. They were admired by people and they gathered political attention and admiration. There are no emotions involved with God. This is not about emotions. It's not about oh he deserves that. He's so kind. He should be He should be my son, you know. And that fellow, he doesn't even deserve me looking at him. There's no emotions with God's choosing. It's all about God's purpose, &gt;&gt; right? Nobody deserves anything. Saints, all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. &gt;&gt; Nobody deserves anything. That's why there's a thing called grace. Because nobody deserves it. It has to do with God knowing it's simply this people. We might as well all say we're all bad people. &gt;&gt; But there's something about our choices that God knew we would make. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And those choices could be used for his purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, let me break it down for you. God knew there would be a Pharaoh born in a certain time who would be an absolute psychopath and a narcissist. He also knew that the Amorites would come to their fullness shortly after a time. After that time, he knew there was going to be a massive famine at a certain time before that. He knew the world would need salvation from the famine and from the Amorites. So he predetermined a process of salvation &gt;&gt; which was going to need predestinated sons. famine Amorites somewhere in between there's a pharaoh he realized I can use this pharaoh that would be the perfect time I could do this I can do so here's what happens he sees that he calls Abraham and starts off a chain of events Abraham and Sarai were in the right time and had the right natures he calls Abram and Sarai and gives them a promise the one promise they know they would die for and that is a child cuz both of them are barren. He knows they would make the right choice. He calls Abram and Sarah, gives them the promise. He knew they'd have Isaac after 25 years. So that after 25 years, I mean, he could have given Isaac after 10 years. Why 25? Because Rebecca had to be in position. &gt;&gt; He saw that by fornowledge. &gt;&gt; Isaac would have to marry Rebecca to bring forth the Jacob. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He could see that. &gt;&gt; Yes. By forn knowledge he predestinates. He knew the absence of Abraham's seed when Abraham seed is taken away from Canaan and they go to stay in Gan. He knew the absence of Abraham's seed was going to cause the rising of the Amorites and the Amorites were going to fill Canaan with lasciviousness uh all kinds of concupisence. And then um he he's going to take them he takes them over. They're gone to go and when the Amorites rise, they're going to they're going to pollute the land and he's going to have to bring them back to put things right. Okay. So, he knew this absence and uh uh it would reach exponential proportions. And Joseph's people were living comfortable and happy in Goan, not desiring to leave, even having forgotten that they had an inheritance given to their grandfather Abraham. Living in Goan, enjoying the comforts under the Pharaoh. Then he knew this was going to happen. Here comes this son of the other Pharaoh who's a total psychopath who decides, well, we've got all these people, talented people. let's build an empire for Egypt. They had no idea what God's purpose was. That God wanted to cleanse the land of the Amorites. That he kept them in Goan waiting for the Amorites to come to its fullness and when it was time has to bring them into hardship to get them to desire to get out from there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God doesn't control by force. He controls by knowing your heart. Amen. &gt;&gt; And what whether your heart is full of faith or doubt and he knows how to allow every individual necessary to make certain choices. Right? Even using the word control desires or needs an explanation, right? God doesn't control you. He controls his purpose. &gt;&gt; Right? We often think he controls us. You know what? I got sick because God wanted me to do that. Don't do that. Right? You a lot of people who think that God controls your life, they're like, "God made me get sick. God brought this death in my family. God made me lose this money to teach me this lesson." You should have learned the lesson without losing the money. Or by God is blessing us with good things. Or this lucky streak. Praise the Lord for this lucky streak. I always tell people you get lucky and what do you do with that luck? &gt;&gt; How much of it do you give back to God? You say it's from God. What what what is God giving you this blessing for? To go off and live a rollicking life. How is that a blessing from God? How is it if it's a blessing from God, it makes you go off and live a life unconscious of God? He doesn't do that. You shouldn't expect things like that of God to make you sick, to bring death, to bring bad times, to do this, to do that. And just because, and the majority of those things in your life are a consequence of your bad decisions, if God brings something, it's got to do with a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Only a purpose. The rest of it is your choices. Don't make everything God's fault and everything else the devil's fault. Yeah, &gt;&gt; it's your choices, right? We know this sickness comes from the devil. God makes you whole. The prophet says, he says those both those things. By the way, the prophet said all sickness comes from the devil. Said God makes you whole. God makes you well. You should know these things. You should ask questions like God you or you shouldn't ask questions like God why did you let me get so sick? Even the devil doesn't make you sick. Sickness comes from the devil. You went and made yourself sick with something from the devil. You got sick as a consequence of your own choices. Nobody asked you to sit next to somebody who was sneezing or some virus. &gt;&gt; Nobody asked you to go shake hands with somebody who had influenza B. Nobody asked you to. You did that. It was your choice. It was your choice to get in that car. It was your choice to sit next to them at work. It was your choice to get in the elevator. You were not being programmed by God. Go to the elevator. I need you to get sick. Salvation only exists because our choices to walk in error get us into trouble. Right? If Adam did not sin, what would be the need of salvation? Salvation was necessary because of our choices. &gt;&gt; So now every day there is a need of salvation of the soul and a need of healing of the mind and the body. Salvation and healing only comes from God. So what is your purpose in the body? If because of our choices there's always weakness, there's always weakness, there's always bad things happening, our choices are causing trouble. What is your purpose for the body? to strengthen the body. Amen. That is the part that brings us to this conversion small thing we're going to speak about today is strengthening your brethren. All right. So, let's go to Luke 22. We're going to be talking about um are you also with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, just before this whole issue happened, the Lord Jesus told them one small thing. One of you is going to betray me. That's all. After that, they ensued a fight, an argument, a contention among them about who would be the greatest among them. And it's not about I'm going to be the greatest. I mean had no they were actually deciding among them who would be the traitor because they were all trying to place a value on themselves who was closer to him, who loved him the most, who he spoke to the most, who he spent the most time with. That's what was going on. And what does he do in verse 25? He says to them, if you look at the politics of the world, he says all the people who are over all the others, the lords and the kings of the Gentiles, they rule all the other people and they are the benefactors. That means the rulers are the ones who benefit. Got it? But you shall not be. So he's literally telling you if you are leaders over my people, you will not be the benefactors. He that is greatest among you, he will be the younger. He's literally telling you in the kingdom of God, if you are chosen to be a leader, you will be a servant. &gt;&gt; And then he tells him, he said, he asks this question as if it's such a foolish question. Whether is who is greater, he that siteth at meat or he that serveth? So the person was well definitely the one who's sitting at meat. So he says to them, well, you are sitting at my table and I'm serving you. You're saying you're greater than me? No, &gt;&gt; let's go to the next one. &gt;&gt; So he says, "You are they which have continued with me in my temptations. You are you are going through the troubles that I am going through. You are suffering the persecution with me." Right? And I've appointed you a kingdom as my father has appointed me. In other words, I'm going to give you rulership. I'm going to give you leadership. I'm going to make you leaders of the church. As I have been given that position, I'm giving you this position and that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, sit on thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel. And then he switches and he speaks to Peter again. The same fellow that he said to feed my sheep. He looks to Peter, Simon, Simon. Now watch this carefully, right? uh he says to him, "Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat." Right? So saints, we um obviously would mean that there would be someone uh some who would um what he's saying in this whole context of scripture, he's literally saying there will be some greater people and some lesser people. &gt;&gt; So let's let's get that out of our system first. God Christ is literally saying there are going to be some greater people in the church and some lesser people in the church. What does he mean by that? Nobody likes that statement but it's the truth. What does he mean? There are some people who are going to have leadership qualities and others who will not have. There are some who would have a certain gift and others who would not. There are some who would be wealthier and some who will be poor. There are some will be educated and some will not be. There are some who will have more means and others who would have less means. He's literally telling you this is going to be a part of the Christian church in the kingdom of God. There are going to be people who are greater and some lesser. There will be some who will have better experiences than others. There are some who will be more righteous than others. There are some who will have greater morals than others. They will come from different life uh experiences. Some who will have more testimonies than others. Some who would have gifts of prophecy. Some who would have riches. Some would have opportunities, better opportunities than others. He's telling us this is going to be the reality. We are not lesser because God made us that way. Do not ever think because someone has more money than you that God blessed them. This this is a thing I hate that rose up in the message. But people look at their wealth and what they have achieved and say God blessed me. &gt;&gt; Be careful what you say &gt;&gt; when you do that. &gt;&gt; Because when you do that, you must realize you have more responsibility to serve. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; This is what's missing. Right? I've heard from where I come from long time ago people who had accumulated wealth and say I've got all this cuz God blessed me and where are you today with all that blessing if people who are the greater people with more opportunities with more abilities with more testimonies with greater experiences if you are the greater and you have the Holy Ghost You should experience the desire to lift your brothers who are lesser out of their hardships because of distress or whatever they're going through. You should have that feeling in you to do something. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you say you have the Holy Ghost because by one spirit are you baptized into one body. You cannot have you cannot be somebody with more means than other people and watch your brother grovel in the dirt &gt;&gt; and and tell me you have the same Holy Spirit. You cannot be somebody who has more means and turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to people in your church who are in need. It's in the entire context of the verses and especially in you see people want purpose but they want positions and recognition. &gt;&gt; This does not require recognition and positions to recognize that you need to strengthen your brethren. &gt;&gt; It's in the entire context of the verses especially in verse 31. And so I strengthening your brethren. The last statement of that that scripture says strengthening your brethren, right? When you are converted. So we're talking about the conversion stage. When you are converted, strengthen your brethren. Okay? Why strengthen your brethren? The context is in verse 31 where it says, "Satan has desired to have you." &gt;&gt; Do you know what that means? Satan has desired to snare to trap you to and then it says to sift you as wheat. What is sift you as wheat? To divide you. That is the enemy's purpose is to divide you. Right? He wants to divide the brotherhood. The context of strengthening your brethren is to oppose the division that the serpent is bringing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have because the enemy wants to divide the brotherhood. Your job is to strengthen the brotherhood. &gt;&gt; Your purpose is to why? Because the brotherhood is elected for God's purpose for an outcome. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A predetermined outcome. And he needs this brotherhood. The enemy wants to divide the brotherhood to prevent the outcome. Your purpose is to keep the brotherhood. &gt;&gt; And what do they do? Now everybody looks at doctrines. Oh, it is the doctrines divided. No, wasn't the doctrines. The first division began because of human leadership recognition and relevance. Not even doctrines. Doctrines. I think I believe doctrines was just a an excuse. The real reason is each one wanted to be more important than the other one. Who was closer to Christ than the other? This is a very big and serious subject when you consider what has happened to the Christian church since the beginning and the message since the beginning. So since the beginning of Christianity, what happened? Nicicoatans came in and the church split in Smyrna and divided into false church and true church and even within the true church division came in. In other words, exactly what Christ said, Satan has desired to divide you. What is your job? Strengthen your brethren. Okay, we are so divided and yet the ministry was given for what? Now this is this is what brother seep read. He read exactly what I'm about to tell you. Right? And we spoke about this on Wednesday when I spoke about um Aaron being anointed with the oil and the blood. And the psalm of David was about how sweet is the oil that was poured upon Aaron. How good and how pleasant it is for brothers to dwell in unity. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is like the oil. &gt;&gt; What was the oil? The oil is connecting. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The oil connects us. The oil connects us to God. &gt;&gt; The oil connects us to the Holy Ghost. If you have the oil and I have the oil, we are connected. &gt;&gt; Satan wants to divide us to do what? To prevent the purpose of God. So let's go to Ephesians. Ephesians chapter 4 2:3. I don't want to preach too much on this. I want to read this and then we're going to close. Uh, of course, I will say some of it and I want to give some encouragement to you and our the preachers in our church and maybe brothers in the message to actually get into this. Ephesians 4 2:3. Are you all ready? with all loneliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forebearing one another in love, endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace. And that's what our brother was praying. How is it that we are united? It is by your holy spirit. If it were not for the holy spirit, we would not be united. So watch this carefully. This is not saying go and make the unity. They're saying keep the unity. &gt;&gt; The unity is already given. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are we united around? The word. &gt;&gt; You are instructed by God your purpose, your calling as brothers of of uh of of the word to keep the unity in the bond of peace. All right. Let's look at what the ministry verse 11-16. Ephesians 4:11-16. He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors, and some teachers. I love this ministers in the messages. Stop there. Verse, by the way, I want you to do this. Go home and read this whole chapter, particularly after verse 16. Okay? Read it. We are going to read it today, but I want you to go back. Do this with your families. All right? Are you still with us? Yeah. He gave the ministry, the five-fold ministry, prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists, and so on. For what? What? For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. So, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers are who? They are leaders who are servants. They are those who are greater who are supposed to esteem themselves lesser. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For what purpose? To serve those who have less than them. &gt;&gt; To do what? To strengthen the brotherhood. To bring unity. To bring completion. Right. Perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry. For the edifying of the body of Christ. What is edifying? feeding my sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Till what? There's a there's an expiration date because we've got to do all this. We've got to serve until what? Till we all come in the unity of the faith. You don't stop working until we all come to the unity of the faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. and the knowledge of the son of God. That's the revelation of Christ unto a perfect man. What's the what's the desired outcome? That all of us must come to the the stature of a perfect man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's what you are predestinated to unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we may be no more children. &gt;&gt; Amen. And this I could take a whole year on, but it'll be mostly criticizing you. I wouldn't do that. That we be no more children tossed to and fro, carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slight of men. That's like in my words, it's going to be of how silly you are that you're taken by suave, charismatic pastors and preachers and ministers who walk up and down putting a spell on you by their charisma and their gifts, by the slight of men. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You are swayed by every wind of doctrine, cunning craftiness whereby they lie in weight. They lie in weight means they design it to deceive you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They deise a message to deceive you. They devise their charisma. They devise their their musicians. They deise their movement in their church to deceive you. To capture your soul, to capture your heart. Who benefits? They benefit. According to Christ's word, they should not be the benefit. They should not be the benefactors. &gt;&gt; The people must be the benefactors. Verse for uh verse 15. But speaking the truth in love may grow up unto him in all things which is the head, even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together. This is the part that I love. Can you see it? The whole body fitly joined together. perfectly placed together, compacted by every joint, right? By every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself. The whole gift is supposed to bring the body of Christ to be perfect, fitted together in perfect unity, completely strong enough to edify itself, to sustain itself, &gt;&gt; not to be dependent. Yeah. I would like it if we all studied for our own personal understanding and also if the ministry of the church, if our brothers who preach can take it upon themselves to take these particular things. I I put them down. There's six things. If you can display them, speaking the truth in love, the whole body fitly joined together, compacted by that which every joint supply. Every joint supply. Compacted. Look into it, brothers. according to the effectual working in the measure of every part. If if you read this, you'll understand there is no insignificant person in our church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Making increase of the body. You want to know what's purpose in your church? Look to your left and right and ask yourself how you can increase your brother in the faith in the faith in the life how you can lift them out of a burden to make their faith stronger then you won't be coming to ask me brother Al what can I what position can I have what designation can I and the best thing about this is you'll do something like that without anyone knowing you did it Because the left hand doesn't need to tell the right hand what it's doing. &gt;&gt; You don't need to even take recognition for it. You want examples? We'll have a meeting. I'll give you plenty of examples. Not today. Maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love. Saints the ministry. I mean, if if I look at Ephesians 4, if I look at what Christ told Peter about us being divided, the enemy wants to sift us like wheat. If I if I look at Ephesians 4 from the beginning, what the five-fold ministry is given, what is spoken of here from verse 11-6 and I ask myself, what have the ministry in the message done with this? We've divided itself. We speak against one another. Those folks who say now we must press play and obey. I I want to ask you a question. Do you really think in your heart of hearts you are going in the rapture without me? Do you really think that? &gt;&gt; Not a chance my friend. Whether you press play and obey or you do whatever you you are not going in the rapture 5 minutes before me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How about you Peruia folks? How about you seven thunder folks? Holy Ghost folks. How about you ABC's only folks? Do you think you are going in the rapture 5 minutes before me? Do you really think you are going in the rapture without us? Not a chance. &gt;&gt; Just because you disagree with me on one or two things or because I preach slightly different to you, is it enough to throw a fit and increase yourself to decrease others? &gt;&gt; How about you in the local churches? Do you spur on and support such anti-body behavior? How how is what you're doing criticizing everybody else online shouting at other people telling us we must press play on obey or we must be Perushia or we must be seven times or we must be this or that or else. Where do you get the gull to do that? To think you would be better than everyone else purely because your expression of the message is different to somebody else's. And when you look at that scripture that says Satan has desired to have you to sift you like wheat, you are accomplishing the purpose of Satan. &gt;&gt; That's amen. &gt;&gt; You are not seeking to bring the brotherhood together. You are not seeking to strengthen. You are being used as a tool to divide people. &gt;&gt; That's right. You are segregating the bride of Christ &gt;&gt; into labels, blasphemous names. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So if after all these years you still think you have allowed the enemy to sift you like wheat, you still children tossed to and fro away from the unity of the faith and the stature of Christ. If you still think you can put a a man today above every other man in the message, you're doing exactly what he said was going to happen. The day you think I am going to let you do that to me is the day we'll part ways. There is no way my name or who I am is going to be elevated over other people to that the moment somebody looks to me to be some leader of the world is the day I quit not quit preaching quit right because I've got to still do what I have to do to bring the bride of Christ according to the way God has chosen me to speak. I must speak what he has revealed to me. I cannot speak anything else. So to me, if some brother preaches the seventh seal in the way that he preaches, I want to hear it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I cannot believe that the way I see the seventh seal. So, so let me say it this way. If you and I see the seventh seal in a way that brings us to the knowledge that we are supposed to be Christ made flesh in this day and part of the coming of Christ, that's great. If another brother interprets the same seals message in a way to bring the same outcome, praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because what's important is the outcome. &gt;&gt; Yes. So if I'm going to allow myself to rise because I think the way I see something is the only way it has to be seen, then I'm dividing the brotherhood. &gt;&gt; I must recognize Peter has a ministry. James has a ministry. Matthew has a ministry. John has a ministry. Paul has a ministry. Matias has a ministry. Everyone has a ministry to see a the same Christ in a different way and preach it to a different people in a particular way to produce the same outcome. Where are we concerning Ephesians 4:11-16? You want to talk about purpose? Here we are. Now I want us to as a church I'm going to read the last part of this and then we can close. I want us to see the character. You talk about conversion. Everybody wants to talk about conversion like you know I gave up smoking. I gave up being of another religion. Now I'm a Christian. I I was a denominational but now I'm a I'm a message believer. You you know denomination. You came here and became another. You became a message believer denomination. You didn't convert. You just left one religion for another religion. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let's see about conversion. Verse 17 and verse 32. Brothers, families, this is the part I say you must read. This is the part I say we must judge ourselves by to know whether you are being converted to strengthen your brethren. This I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind. Start there. Do I walk in the vanity as other Gentiles walk? Is my everyday life lived for the purpose of God or for the purpose of the Gentiles? Nobody can tell you that. Only you can tell yourself that. This is where it starts. Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through ignorance that is in them. You all sitting here will say, "No, no ways." You know, I'm I I'm not alienated. I I don't have my understanding darkened. I'm not alienated from the life of God through ignorance. Are you not alienated? Do you choose a life of isolation from God's people? How how together are you with the purpose of God's word? How together, how united are you together with the purpose of this church? &gt;&gt; Do you know there's a quote brother Baron says? You should desire that your church should succeed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Do you succeed in what? Right. because of the blindness of their heart, who being past feeling have been have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to walk to work all uncleanness with greediness, but you have not so learned Christ. If so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus. Here it is that you put off concerning the former conversation the old man for me to see decades later people's true colors showing now of what they always were to to come to a stage now where you can totally lose the plot and act like an univilized unsaved person in the message is beyond me. It does nothing to fulfill the purpose of God. Right? Which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust. Be renewed in the spirit of your mind. There's a whole series alto together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That you put on the new man. There's another series. &gt;&gt; Which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness, which is what we were speaking of recently, consecration. How about this? putting away lying. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you right now, the majority of message people have not overcome this. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You still lie to each other. You still lie to your husbands and wives. You lie to your children. You lie to your parents. You lie to your ministers. You lie to your deacons. You lie to your boss. You lie to your school. You lie to your teachers. You lie to everybody. You cannot be a person who strengthens the brethren while you lie. &gt;&gt; Put away lying. Nobody talks about this. How about converting from this? If if nobody lies in this place, I tell you, we'll have a fantastic time. &gt;&gt; Speak every man truth with his neighbor. You know, I I had some people in my life as a minister. They did something wrong. They they came here to confess not because they were sorry. They came here to confess because they were caught. &gt;&gt; Yeah. and took advantage of the forgiveness of our people because our people hugged them, cried with them, gave them grace, and then they go off and spurn it and slap us in the face with it. But they were not confessing because they truly had a heart that was contrite and desired to be right with God. If they had not been caught out, they would not have confessed. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And yet we've got to do what the church is meant to do. We've got to forgive. We've got to still try and help you. But because you didn't confess with a contrite heart in the beginning, because you didn't put away lying, you pay for it. Speak every man truth. For we are members one of another. We owe it to ourselves, to our brothers to live in the light. When I say walk in the light, I mean tell the truth. Be open. Let your yay be yay in your navy nay. Don't let someone have to constantly check what you are saying whether it is true or not or suspect you. Did this happen? 20 questions. Just say the right thing from the first. So you don't go through 20 questions. How about this? Verse 26. Be you angry and sin not. He's actually telling you you can get angry. I love getting angry. It makes me test myself. Makes me get better. Be angry and sin not. This is important for one another because you can be angry and sin. What is the sin? What is the sin? Anybody? What is the sin? Going to bed, fuming, ignoring people. No, the sin is breaking up the brotherhood. The sin is dividing your brothers. Be angry with one another and sin not against the body. Do not resent the movement of the Holy Spirit. Do not resent the Holy Ghost. Do not divide one another from one another. Be angry and sin not. Do not lessen your brother's testimony while speaking to somebody else. What What is Ephesians 4 about? the unity of the body. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Neither give place to the devil. Devil is a false accuser. There it is. &gt;&gt; Right. Don't give place to false accusers. Verse 28. I love this. Let him that stole steal no more. That means you might very well have a thief in your church. Let him that steal that stole steal no more. And then what do you do? Put him to work. Let him labor working with his hands. Take that thief and make him do honest work with his hands in the thing which is good. And then he must with the work he must be able to give back to him that need it. That's him putting his life of stealing. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know what these people who come to message churches? I feel like message churches are places for miscarrians to come here and hide. You know, we live righteous. We live our lives. We don't go drinking, smoking, fornicating, adulterating. We we marry a girl. We have our our family. We bring up our sons, our children in the right way. We we suffer with making the right decisions only to fund your irresponsibility. and you come here asking for handouts because it's the church's right to support you and then you still go back and live this irresponsible life. Sorry, not happening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't live my life responsibly so I can fund your irresponsible life. Don't come and ask me for a loan when you act irresponsibly. There's a scripture here for you. You that stole, steal no more. Do honest work. Get something so you give back to others. That's how you get rid of your reputation of stealing. It's in the Bible. And that's how you will actually strengthen your brotherhood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 29. Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that which is after so far, how many of you have been converted? You're laughing. But that which is good to the use of edifying, it means whatever you speak to your brothers and sisters must edify. Right? That it may minister grace unto the hearers. &gt;&gt; And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption. This people use as in don't go and backslide. You're grieving the Holy Spirit. He's like a dove. He's fly away when you do something wrong. When you go smoke that cigarette, it's not talking about that. He already knew you were going to do that. Grieve not the Holy Spirit that binds the people together. This entire chapter is about the unity of the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 31. Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, evil speaking be put away from you with all malice, and be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you. Everything in Ephesians 4 is speaking about strengthening your brethren. How many of you want purpose? You got the way I see it, we have a lot to work on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before if you don't have this desire for the strengthening of the brethren and the souls that are in your church, how will you have the desire for souls outside? &gt;&gt; You wouldn't. That is the reason you don't testify because you are not even united with your own people. You distrust one another. You lie to each other. You're not honest with each other. You esteem others higher than others. As long as you do that, you are not one body. You are not work. It's like a crowd. See, when when a crowd has purpose, it's moving together. It's closer. It's closely knit. You are like a crowd dispersed. And as this dispersed crowd, you're moving while you can see each other in the distance. And when the herd is dispersed, the enemy can pick you off one by one. &gt;&gt; Learn a little bit from the African buffalo. Stick together. &gt;&gt; Stand for one another. Hold up each other's testimonies. Esteem your brother higher than yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of those underlined phrases requires a serious discussion. If I had to do church camps or family camps, this is what I'll do. I wouldn't waste my time on multitudes of song specials at camps and preachers outperforming one another. What a waste of time. All you achieve is having a good time. This is the stuff you should actually talk about at church camps. &gt;&gt; Strengthening your brethren. Strengthening your brethren. In closing, it's not about, you know, something bad happens to your brother, they're sick. This is how you know this the cell phone, WhatsApp, all of that is providing a really weak response. Just so you send a message, we're praying for you. We're good. Then I forget about you for 7 days. &gt;&gt; Right? That's how it is. It's so good. It's so convenient. It's what's happening. It's where you're heading to. Right? And this is so strengthening your brethren is not about when he's in a bad situation, pat him on the back. It's don't worry brother, it's going to be okay. God knows all things. He knows all that. What are you telling him that for? He knows that all himself when he prays, God even tells him that. He doesn't need to tell you, pet him on the back. Don't worry, brother. We hug him. We're here for you. We here for you mean how? Just to hug me and tell me it's going to be okay. Strengthening your brotherhood. Strengthening the brotherhood means preventing division, patching up division caused by an enemy, restoring unity that has been lost, focusing on what divided us, target it, and bring out the truth. You know what's the real problem I see with our generation is you're afraid of the truth. You're afraid to confront the truth. And this is the problem. More than likely, if I confront you with the truth, you will leave the church. That's your solution. Leave the church. Instead of admitting the truth or working, brother Al, what can I do to make this right? What can I do to make this better? You don't even see the value in that. When you leave the church, you tell your child, "This is how we solve problems. &gt;&gt; This is how we do things. We speak truth to power. We'll let the preachers know. We give them the third degree. We'll sort them out." What you don't realize is that child is going to grow up and give you the third degree &gt;&gt; pretty soon because you just taught them how to deal with conflict. leave the church, speak to the hand. H that's what you teach them. That's what they're going to do to you. So this is why if myself or the deacon has to confront you and actually tell you the plain old cutting truth, will you have the character to remain and strengthen the brethren or will you fold up and leave the church? The majority of people choose the latter. Leave the church because they don't want to confront the truth and then leave the church and say, "If you speak about me, I'll bring the law against you." Defamation. Saints, you may think it's doctrines that divided us. It's not. It was always human leadership. &gt;&gt; Always. It's not doctrines. uh always men desiring to be high than when it started with the perua with the seven thunders whichever doctrine came up it was because other men were feeling they were more important than others. The doctrines I think were like the thing that they used to make them higher than someone else. Amen. It was the same in the time of Christ. It was the same in the church ages. It is the same in the message today. Unity can only exist by the Holy Spirit. By one spirit are you baptized into one body. Humility, truth and righteousness will restore the unity of the faith. First you have to be united in faith. Two cannot walk together unless they be agree. &gt;&gt; So we can actually be a body of this church if we agree on what is being preached. If we see the same thing. If we agree in faith. We don't have to understand it all the same way. Exactly the same. But we can all agree the seventh seal is open. The book has come down. We are part of the bride of Christ. We are becoming him. We all agree on that. How you see it is a different story. We can work together. We are here to work together to get each joint fitly compacting everything together. Right? You don't come here to make unity. You come here to keep the unity. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't come here for a free ride. That's not how church works. You prove yourself by making a commitment. Right. And I feel like the model of the Christian church has changed. And I'm not sure I I'm being honest with you. I don't think it can ever go back to the way it was meant to be. Um, for example, when the first church began, you had all the disciples, you know, all the disciples had wives and children, but they were commissioned by God to take the gospel to the world. So, they had no jobs. They were commissioned to take the gospel to the world. Who takes care of the wife and children back home? So, what do they do? They brought everything they owned together and they dispersed. They divided their stuff among one another. How many of you will divide your pension fund with me or your house or lend me your car? Do you know what it was like in the days when the message first came? &gt;&gt; A brother who was a rich brother would lend you his Mercedes Benz to take the message to a place where we had to cross a river. Most of you would not do that today. That's how times are changed. You need your car. You have to go to work. You have to do this. You have to do You're already esteeming your life above the purpose of the gospel because you've gotten so into this thing that the only thing we have to do is come to church on Sundays and listen to the message and go back home and live our lives. There's no thought of passing the word on. There's no thought. Do you think I've got money lying around in my bank to fund my own trips overseas? I don't have that. If somebody doesn't fund my trip to go somewhere, I can't go. Do you did you ever think about where that money must come from? And this is not me asking you for money. I would never do that. Literally, a brother who invites me will have to pay for my trip. He will have to pay my plane ticket. Of course, I would take care of my visas and whatnot. all that and and get to go over there and preach the word of God. The model of the church has changed because we no longer have the desire in our churches to spread the gospel. We have this desire to make this benefit me. How does this benefit me? That's the problem. That's your problem. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm not speaking to anyone else. I'm speaking to you in this church. Your mentality is how this church benefits me. You know what's your problem? You pay tithes to the pastor and therefore the pastor is obligated to serve you. &gt;&gt; That's what you think. That's what churches think. It's like a transaction. Did you really think you pay tithe so I can serve you? You might as well leave right now because I don't believe that. Do you know why the Levites were not given an inheritance in the promised land? They were not given land. Do you know why? Because they could not spend time with their own job. I am perfectly capable to earn my own living with my intelligence and my gifts that I have. I am here because God has chosen me to give you the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not paying me to do that. If you do that, you have a carnal mind &gt;&gt; and you are not even joined with the body. So when bad things happen to you and you think you paying me tithe and I didn't call you when you was sick, you already have a wrong idea &gt;&gt; because you already think that I owe you services because you pay tithe to me. And this goes for all the message churches. &gt;&gt; Why would you leave a church for personal differences? That's what Christ said the enemy wants to do. Right. Here's the truth. If somebody is sick in your area and you stay in that area, you are the one supposed to visit them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You are the one who supposed to raise your brother out from his situation. It's not the pastor's job to do that &gt;&gt; because you pay me tithe. It's not. My job is not to sit at tables. My job is not to apply the bomb and gillad for you. And I am not supposed to feel threatened because you pay my tithes. I have to be so annoyed and call you in case you stop paying me tithes. &gt;&gt; Then I am not even called. &gt;&gt; See what what do we really want? This is my problem. We want purpose in church but we are forgetting our purpose. You will have you will have poor people in your church who you may not know has lost their job or not have enough finances for their child to be educated. But you will invest in gold and silver for another company and see no reason to invest in the education of one of the body of Christ. And you can't see that you could put away so much a month to educate a child who has less than you in your body which you call the church who you say you are bonded with and you are one body. You will not because you will care for yourself. You don't realize the Bible tells you if you take care of someone, you invest in another child in this church, the one day when you grow up, you're all alone, your family's gone, your husband has died, your wife has died, your children have left you, that one will take care of you. That's what happens in the body of Christ. That child you invested in will actually take care of you. But on the pathway, you don't realize the purpose of God and what it will do for you. This is the purpose failing in message churches because we are too concerned with self. You want purpose? What purpose? You you can't sail across the sea while you can't save someone right here in your church. Nobody else takes accountability for members of the local church. That's how it is. It's the pastor's job. It's brother Alistister's church. He must take care of them. Brother Alistister's wife must talk to the sister who's not me. I don't have to. We pay our tithes. They must do the job. That's the wrong mentality. That's the wrong idea. How are you not noticing someone in need? How are you not noticing someone who needs spiritual upliftment? Because if you uplift them spiritually, you are doing the purpose of God to strengthen the brethren to feed the sheep, which is the original purpose God gave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am doing my purpose. I am answering the call to take the word to the world and to give you the word. What call are you answering? Nothing in Ephesians 4 speaks about our doctrines. In a sovereign church, we all have the same doctrine. We are not divided on doctrines in this place. So what prevents us from our purpose in God in the message globally? It's our need for relevance. Ministers fight at pulpits for relevance, for recognition that causes us to divide ourselves and to devise doctrines, to devise a better understanding than another minister. For what reason? So what do we do, brother Al? You know, come together for the sake of it. Just put aside our differences and and and you know, just be one and love one. That sounds ecumenical. Yes, that's exactly ecumenical. That's not what we must do. None of the things spoken in Ephesians 4, Ephesians 4 speaks about doctrines. It all speaks about behavior. You want to talk about conversion? That's the kind of conversion I want to see. That's the kind of conversion I want to see in myself. Amen. It's not our need for relevance. These are the behaviors that all fall under manipulation, narcissism, and nickelotinism. Nickelanism was the first speck in the first church age. What is it? the desire to control the leoty. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If all church is to us is meeting here on Sunday, having a song service, listening to the word, going back home, and forgetting about our people and our purpose. We're not strengthening the brother. &gt;&gt; Think of this. And this is so apt because we are having a brother's meeting after the service to talk about this. &gt;&gt; We didn't plan it. I certainly didn't plan this, but we are talking about finding purpose among our brothers. We're having we're going to do a presentation and have some discussion and a little workshop together to discuss this. Right? Think of the saints. If we overcome these things, we will have the ability to hear one another and just talk with one another without needing to outdo one another. Then we can actually strengthen our breath. Amen. There's a lot more I can speak about this, but I think we can probably flesh this out further in different messages. Our brothers can take it up too, and we'll speak a lot more with our brothers. There's so many things running parallel that we'll be speaking about this afternoon in the brother's meeting. But for now, let's bow our heads. Let's commit ourselves to the Lord as we close. Amen.
