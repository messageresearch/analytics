message a Salvation to us that is more than anything else in this world a word that is able to transform a world a word that is able to change lives that were lost lives that others felt were meaningless and worthless but you picked us up by that word and transformed Our Lives till even those on the outside can witness and testify that these are changed beings these are changed people these are people who are of value to society and Lord we are so thankful that you have made meaningful lives out of our Lives oh God Mercy thankful Lord for once again and give you praise for this

Savior Jesus Christ good to be with all of you once again sharing the word of God this morning it is the 16th of October 2022 and we're we're thankful that God has sent us this glorious message in this time that gives so much more meaning to life so much more understanding wisdom beyond what we could have ever imagined and I truly believe has transformed it has transformed the lives of so many people uh and and like we've been speaking in the last few years uh how our minds have been taken away from the mind of the world uh taken away from the thinking we once had and brought into a new life a new thinking a new understanding better wisdom for almost every single sphere of life so that is what we want to speak on this morning so I kind of feel like I want to conclude the series on the benefits of the message and this is benefits of the message 2022 part 77 and we're overcoming the mind of today's world part 12. and so for today we're going to be looking at the mind of trusting in systems so those of you who remember in the series this little mini series within the big series we were speaking of the mind of the world and we looked at the mind of different things and when we speak of the mind of different things whether it be the mind of Politics the mind of abortion the mind of transgenderism homosexuality the mind of racism all these kind of things and look at why man is so affected by the mind of those things and you see that those things whatever they are they are things created by man to control other people and there is a mind behind it and the mind is always transferred the mind that comes from these philosophies from these understandings is always transferred to you by teaching by manifestation of things people do by governments by politics by leaders by church leaders by religions that mind of all those things seems to be sort of infecting everything around us so they learn to put those things into your school syllabus into universities into the workplace almost every single mind of the world is infecting every realm of your life and you were called in this day to overcome that mind amen and that is why we are speaking this particular subject or have been for the last 12 services on that so today we're going to look at the mind of trusting in systems amen and I hope it's a it's a good exercise for us today to understand this and for a title our belief our belief versus modern systems amen I think the prophet would have enjoyed this particular subject because when you when you read the message you see how often he picks up on those thoughts on the mind of the world and how everyone behaves and he even said it's been the greatest thing of his life to just watch the behavior of people and the nature that is within people amen so I want to um as an introduction to this and I hope not to be too long this morning because it isn't a very lengthy uh subject I want to elaborate on the three philosophies Society depends on to maintain our morality three philosophies so and there are things that you don't even consider you actually used it this morning on the way to church three philosophies that have been trained into man when you go through school when you when you learn to drive when you become an adult you become so accustomed to these philosophies you don't even realize you are trusting in modern day systems right so most people on Earth desire that all men and women be moral is that right you get out there to people in the street you ask them a question you talk to them and you find they genuinely want to be good except for the criminals but they genuinely want to be good people want to say good morning to you they want to do a nice thing for you when you meet them at the supermarket or the shopping mall or in a parking lot people genuinely want to do things good and they want you to do something good back to them so most people in the world doesn't matter what race you are what religion you come from what culture you have they want to be moral they want you to be moral back to them right and everyone understands what it means to be good and decent from the time you were a child you start to learn what is good and decent and you can see with the child when he grabs something from someone else and he looks at the face of the other child and he sees the child then he tries to give it back and then the other child grabs it then he and they start to learn what is good and what is not good from from their feelings and you don't need a University degree to learn what is good and decent somehow or the other as children grow they can read people's faces and they can understand from who is hurt who is happy and they can sense because there's something inside that knows what is good and decent and that comes from God modern society our world has developed a way of governing people governing the world to maintain a sense of morality that means we have we've had the government come in with laws legislature policies to make sure we don't become criminals do you realize that you could have on the way here stopped by anywhere and stolen something from someone right you could just walk into a shop steal something and come on why don't you do it you say well well it's not the right thing to do but there are people who actually do it but the government has laws in place because you also know if you just do that you can get arrested and thrown in jail so there's also another reason not necessarily because we are good people but we have fear of going to prison so we'll maintain good behavior because there are systems in place to warn us that if we have bad behavior we'll come under severe correction and we are trusting those systems that's why when you see somebody you're driving in your car and you see someone on the road do something that is against the law immediately your face goes up in anger and you look at them and what kind of person is that you'd break the law because there's a law in place and because you know the law and that person knows the law and you know that person knows the law when they do something wrong it affects you emotionally and your face shows it your hands sometimes show so modern societies develop these systems there are many parts to these systems but everything comes under three main philosophies now I apologize for the word philosophies if it sounds too great but philosophy is basically ideas and thinkings of man that are formulated put together to teach something to teach ways of life if I could simplify the meaning of philosophy you have a philosophy you have a philosophy even if you don't call it that you can call it your way your manner something like that but you have a philosophy of how you run your home your wife knows it even your dogs know it see you don't have to teach philosophy through English it happens and it is learned by behavior and people can sense what kind of philosophy you have at home so using that word is not something that you have to learn at University these three main philosophies or systems that we use in this world are used to rule and govern people and we all fall under it we all use it and I want to highlight that to you today all of us come how much much there are so many examples I can give you to illustrate this point but my favorite one which I have used before uh several times is is one that can appeal to everyone and that is driving a car all right for those of you who are drivers and those of you who are dreaming of driving right there are three philosophies you depend on to save your life every day if you or any normal message person think of driving a car on a busy City Road let's say this N3 which is a this N3 freeway or even a road where there's two two-way traffic let's take a road where there's two-way traffic it doesn't matter you're a Believer you're a message believer and you think you're driving a car on a busy City Road in midday traffic you realize you could be killed at any point on that road at any time of the day is that right how many of you today get in to your car thinking I could be killed today you don't you've forgotten about that listen there are cars coming at you in the opposite direction at a hundred kilometers an hour do you know what happens if you're standing there and a car hits you at 100 kilometers an hour you will not survive and if two cars come together at 100 kilometers an hour you're not wearing your seatbelt you will not survive you will fly out of your seat smash your head into the windscreen and that's the end of you and you realize that you are in that Peril every day if you're driving a car or you are in a taxi we have created a system of driving that could kill us every day and yet we do it so why are you doing it because you feel there are systems in place that can prevent you from dying and those systems are in place and we trust those systems with our lives without children's lives every single day and you get into the car knowing you could die and you still do it what kind of foolish organism does something like that everywhere in the world organisms creatures will not do things that endanger their lives yet you and I do it every single day that car kills more people in South Africa than anything else I mean over the December period we have to keep counting every year between seven and seven hundred and a thousand deaths just over the Christmas and and festive season is that right not counting the amount of accidents so if you if you count since the time cars were developed how many deaths there are every single year somehow we are still not afraid of it why are we not afraid of it why are our minds tricked into believing that we will survive every single day because we place our faith in those systems without realizing it you have a sort of belief or faith that you won't be killed based on three basic systems three basic philosophies three basic things number one is the individual conscience of the other person so when you're sitting in your car there's another man driving towards you you're thinking well he won't knock me because he also doesn't want to die and we're depending on that that's the first one individual conscience you are depending on the individual conscience of every other driver on the road so they are thinking they want to stay alive so therefore you will be alive you're safer as long as everyone has that individual conscience that's the first one the second system is politics and the law right and we'll explain that just now as long as there are laws in place you are expecting the other drivers to abide by the laws therefore we can feel safe and therefore we won't die when we get into our cars and the third one is religion you are expecting the other people to believe in God of some kind and that they can treasure life and value life so they won't do anything erratic and irregular to kill you so you're depending on individual conscience politics and law and someone else's belief in God so that we can live every day when we get into our car are we only talking about driving we're not even talking about many other things that we place our life in every single day so these are three parts of society that we depend on in all things for us to live peacefully among one another we believe and place our faith in these three systems to work simultaneously for us and we get upset when those systems fail us right you know when someone's individual conscience gets in your way and you wonder how could you be so immoral how could you be so rude how could you do that it gets to you that someone does not have an individual conscience about a specific thing you get upset you get worked up so badly you can go to the police and charge them for something am I right so we believe and place our faith in these three systems to work together we want them to work together simultaneously means at the same time every single day and we don't want them to fail us we don't want these systems to fail us we want it to work the way it should when someone deliberately goes against these systems it really irks us I don't think there's a single driver who does not get Road Rage or angry with somebody else or not road rage but angry with somebody else when they do something wrong it doesn't matter how nice a mood you are in if someone Skips a red light immediately or brow frowns up what kind of person is that okay but the day comes when you skip a red light in Europe they should know we have an emergency right individual conscience let's get to that first part so individual conscience is often based on science means Discovery and knowledge right so science knowledge and parenting so let me let me just put it to you plainly when you're placing your life in the hands of other individuals you are depending on a thought that they might have had a good upbringing hahaha let's hope that taxi driver had a good upbringing so he'll consider my life as much as his own let's hope that that guy in the red Ferrari has had had has had a good upbringing so that you consider my life as valuable as his own and he won't do anything Reckless to push me off the road or something depending on them right now the individual's conscience has got to do with a person knowing within himself what is morally right you are depending on another person to have an understanding of what is morally right so you really trust all those people you don't know were driving past you on the roads every day you you don't even know they're all strangers you don't know where they come from how they were brought up what their philosophies you don't know whether they believe in God or not but you trust they're not going to knock into you what's the reason humans always want a reason I want evidence I want evidence without evidence I'm not going to believe in him what evidence do you have that that person in front of you is going to do the right thing you have no evidence you're depending upon the system that individual conscience of a person has been influenced by the morality of his parents so the first thing you're going to know is the person who's coming at you at 120 kilometers an hour he has had parents who brought him up in a way you have no idea but you're hoping they brought him up with good values right they may have taught him from childhood in the aspects of culture traditions and maybe just plain family Dynamics you know whether they taught him his p's and q's more than likely if they brought him up with manners he will drive responsibly it's true it's Behavior if he was a ill-man and child he's going to be a really reckless driver more than likely that's how human behavior is so if it's family Dynamics and the education the knowledge given to him more than likely if he went ahead and got a schooling uh past School past got a diploma or a degree and got a good standing job more than likely that upbringing is going to make him value his life so he wouldn't do something Reckless those sound like stereotypes but that's human behavior right and that's the reason you feel the system will work for you if you have a casual conversation with people they'll tell you you know life would be easier if more people were educated we feel that way yet all the mass murderers in the world were highly educated like Hitler so but we feel those systems work for us the more we educate the people the more peaceful they become it's a lie it's a fallacy but it's kind of the systems we all expecting to to get some of the most timid and respectful people are the people in rural areas who have never seen any education there's no proof that education makes you a more moral person or a nicer person it's just one of those systems we were forced to believe in but it isn't necessarily true so how the person is brought up the education the knowledge of the knowledge of the outside world you know I've seen that stereotype many times you see someone driving on the road and they're really irritating you and you drive past them with a front and think wherever you grown up on a farm this isn't an ox cart it's a highway you know even they can't hear you you're saying you're saying but you feel good afterwards right but you can feel how that the philosophies that you've adopted have given you these ways of stereotyping people and uh and yet you are using these things and you're expecting them to work for you to save your life every single day if you look at parenting and upbringing this is based on how if the person traveling towards you whether he was uh how he was spoken to as a child whether he was spoken gently to whether he was bullied by his father because if he was bullied more than likely he became an aggressive person an aggressive person more than likely is going to have a heavy Lead Foot on the accelerator and he's going to zip through traffic because he's he's got aggression and he's a bully and so on So You Think of Parental upbringing and you think how he was treated by his elders and his peers and how they taught him to view other races of people how to respect the opposite sex how he was instructed to deal with life's problems the techniques he learned as a child to solve difficult issues either by anger or impulse or by calm and Sensibility you think you you need to feel that that guy was parented correctly so that he doesn't get Reckless and knock into you imagine that you're depending on someone's parents who you don't even know about then there is science a science has regards to that driver coming towards you how he views the universe how you've used the Earth whether he feels responsible to the Earth you know you can see people uh when they're driving on the on the freeways or something and you see them throw out beer cans in the windows and the beer can goes bang bang bang onto the road and you're driving of course the beer can is not going to hurt you it might just scratch your car but it makes you angry he's a little bugger he's a filthy person doesn't respect the earth and the rest how far the rest of the half an hour of your life is is torn apart by this person through a beer can you just spoiled your life for half an hour right because he doesn't care about the environment and you feel so morally High you care about the environment uh but of course you're not going to stop and pick up the beer can and make sure you throw it in the bin you're just angry because that guy's morality was messed up and I have a right to be angry with him right so things like that you're hoping people are educated to care for the Earth and if he cares for the Earth and he cares for the environment he'll drive safely as well you won't want to cause accidents in oil spillage and uh wastefulness and things like that you'll think he he has a good understanding of the universe the Earth whether he has any responsibility towards him science influences his ability to use technology responsibly if you respect science he understands things you know nowadays the more common thing is driving while on the cell phone and uh at first everyone was doing it then we realized how dangerous it was and the laws came out and the warnings came out and then now we all realize don't drive in text and now when we see someone do it our morality goes up and we say horrible irresponsible person texting and driving you should know better right so just looking at these things you realize how much you're banking on but we're only speaking about one thing so far individual conscience of that one philosophy look at how much you're banking on to keep you alive on the way to church here through the roads you realize you could pass through any of these streets and somebody people could just stand out in front and throw rocks at your car and that's the end they have the ability there's plenty of rocks everywhere they have the ability they can do whatever they want to so but you're depending upon Society to be civil to be nice to respect your property to not willingly do something to destroy your car crash your car you're hoping people are brought up right and they have their own individual conscience every day and I guarantee when you get into your car every day you don't even think about it you don't even consider that somebody is out there who doesn't care about you or your car and is willing to smash you to smithereens but it doesn't occur to you because you're trusting in the system then we come to politics and the rule of law now here's this is one of the most important things we depend on politics to set for our country's people to live in in Rel to set laws for for our country's people to live in harmony and peace that's what we want is that right we want people to understand listen don't break into people's houses follow the law of the land follow the law of traffic and we can all live in peace and we'll be happy you'll be happy I'll be happy we'll have a great life just and we're trusting the government just to keep that up you know all we want from the government is to set the law police the law correct the offenders you know and we'll be happy we'll make our life by ourselves just so long as they keep that going for us and we will even pay our taxes regularly as long as they can keep this politics because a system that works we place our trust in it amen we depend on correct traffic laws now how many of you feel 120 kilometers an hour is perfectly safe to drive it all right yeah we feel it but who told us that our government made the law have you ever been hit by a cricket ball that's coming at you at 120 case per hour I have I've been hit at one coming at 140 kilometers an hour tell you what it's enough to break a rib bust an eyeball fracture a toe out can you imagine a whole car coming to you at 120 K's an hour it's not safe it's not safe to drive at 120 kilometers an hour in your car it's not safe to drive at 100 it's not safe to drive at 80. it's not safe to be sitting behind a a machine with an engine and wheels that could pop out at any instant how if you get up every morning and make sure your wheel nuts are all tight got loose right no there's so much of trust in the system how have you when you go to tiger Wheel and Tire and after they've done it you go and test it everything yourself no because you trust their system these guys are trained one thing about them they're good they've got the diplomas and they've got the certificates that those wheel nuts are definitely tight in the best way there's no way I'm driving and our Wheels popping out not a chance we trust the system see the rule of law and don't worry if something goes wrong I will sue them because that you'll have to be alive to sue them based upon laws of the land and in his willingness to keep those laws you are hoping he would not crash into you and take your life you're hoping the other person driving towards you is a law-abiding citizen one who has gotten his license and didn't buy it and someone who actually learned to drive k-53 and got the lessons and learned the rules of the road and understands all the signs you're hoping he keeps the law to keep you alive he or she or even the 16 year old who stole his father's car on other things we depend on laws to control senseless killing of people rape sexual assault death penalty abortions we allow politics to Define marriages right what marriages are legal what are illegal we depend on our political or how divorces should be handled and setting the rights for women and children and once it's signed in we kind of just fall into line we accept it we go along with it we expect courts to exercise the correct judgment and law enforcement to to protect the helpless and and be a help to guide people to enforce the laws set by the politicians I hope you know how things work right the politicians are the big guys top of the pyramid they set the laws the police is a system of justice and the and the courts that are below them to enforce the laws set by the politicians do you know the police they keep the laws based on what the politicians tell them every time a policy is changed it's got to filter down to the police and the police have to adjust the way they they police the the government they police the people if the police do not govern by the law set by the politicians the police are fired or they're supposed to be right that's how it works and then finally it comes down to you so when you break a law the police have the right to arrest you take you to the judicial system the judges convict you put you in prison and the politicians rest well thinking we did the right thing system works for you right so we expect the course to exercise what happens when a judge lets someone go someone who burgled your house but there wasn't enough evidence what do you feel like there the system failed me the same system that's been working but just when it happens to you and things don't go the way you want to suddenly the system fails you right do you know how many people in this country feel that way right now yeah so in essence by us voting we are putting the choice in a political party on whether and how babies should be aborted how people should be killed in the death penalty we feel it's moral as long as a higher power has decided for us well I'm not really the one who did the lethal injection or the the hanging or the whatever it is I'm not really the one who did it it's the government that did it but it looked like it deserved it because of what he did in such and such and such because the political system has chosen that system We Stand by it we're good with that one of these phones is speaking to me here all right so uh politics is supposed to control race relations the racial tension in society politics is supposed to control that right they're not supposed to stoke fires and make things worse they're supposed to make policies that make us live together in peace it's supposed to control properly and show fairness to all Races and cultures so in the case of your oncoming driver the laws make you drive properly and if he crashes into you and you survive you have the law behind you to find him guilty and pay for your damages right so that's the kind of comforting thought so if he crashes into me I've got my insurance my insurance will pay my car but also if he um I can I can prove that he's the one who's guilty I've got that law what if you didn't have that law what if those laws were not there what if there were no such thing as insurances how safe would you feel buying a car that's half a million see if those systems were not in place you'd suffer losses so bad so you're trusting those systems so the other driver as well you're you're hoping he understands that if he crushes his car he also has to pay he's also going to suffer so if we both have that understanding we'll try our best not to crash now I don't know if you've ever tried to teach someone to drive especially a lady for the first time I I try to teach my sister to drive and she got behind the car and while she's driving and uh she sees a car coming she went it's like I'll put your hands in the steering wheel he's gonna knock me he said no he doesn't want to knock you see there was I teaching the system he doesn't want to knock you he wants to avoid you you try to avoid him if you don't look at him and take your hands off you might crash into him so from the start you have to get into a car and try to think the other person doesn't want to knock me I've got to trust that I will start building my faith in there and drive on the road eventually after a while you see especially with the young fellas they get so relaxed trusting everybody that one hand is on the steering wheel all and he's hanging out the window they're so relaxed I trust you you trust me we're all good see but when we start we're like over correcting taking the band really really slow now we're Pros we know the system we trust everybody see the other driver has to be afraid to crash into you so you're trusting that but you are hoping that every car that passes you each day is a good law-abiding citizen are you 100 guaranteed that everyone is 100 percent law-abiding citizen do you know how many accidents we have in Durban in one day of course the last one nowadays is religion you're hoping the other person fears God and that he wouldn't want to willingly do something to hurt you because he fears God and he believes in God and he knows he doesn't want to hurt his fellow man for Spiritual reasons and you're trusting that this man has respect for the presence of God and you believe that you are the same now religion is by far what many people in South Africa depend on for Morality we're still a country that that is very religious it's moving away very fast because of Hollywood and American sort of influence Western influence but in this country many people are still very religious right and we depend on God for our morality we don't depend on someone else's idea for Morality so but it is being found that there is so much immorality occurring in religious organizations that many people in the world are actually losing faith in God many people the Next Generation the children are coming out saying well we don't believe in God God doesn't exist I know my parents are hypocrites I know my Apostle is a hypocrite I know the church people are hypocrites definitely something's wrong they lied to us for so long and you can see that happening with each generation that passes religion was designed by men to help people submit to a higher power to force people to be moral beyond their own conscience because if you see that there is someone who is higher than you and that person or that God has the greatest morality then you'll respect that you as a a person you'll try to be better than even your own thinking and we're depending on good Christian people good Hindu people good Muslim people good Buddhist people we're we're depending on these people who believe in God to live by the morality their religion teaches them and hopefully that morality Will Keep Us Alive longer that we're hoping for religion is supposed to tell you how God wants you want your married life truality bringing up children how you dress decently in public your use of money society's obligations your prayer your fasting your sacrifice religions are supposed to teach you those things and make you focus your faith on God are supposed to to to place morality into a follower of any religion amen so the idea of religions is bear with me I'm just getting through the first three philosophies then we're going to get into what we have to talk about so the idea of religions is if we scared them enough about hell and death or teach them a philosophy about the transfer of energy or the law of karma make them look forward to being in a beautiful place called heaven or a better life after death we could control their behavior we can make them decent Society it was a good thought thousands of years ago religion was the best thought because they had no politics then and government so religions was the government so if that man hurtling towards you at 120 case per hour if he has respect for God and he fears death then you have more chance of surviving right because he feels he doesn't want to die too so he's going to keep both hands on his steering wheel both eyes fixed on the road watching his rear view mirror being a conscientious human being because he fears death what do you do with someone who doesn't fear death or who doesn't care is that a really bad day life just went completely bad for him and he doesn't care whether he lives or dies you better hope that fellow is not the one hustling towards you with 150 kilometers an hour so imagine how many cars we pass on the roads every day and each one involves the same process of faith in our minds in those three systems every day every car you drive past you are hoping those three systems work for you so that you live how many of you count how many cars you passed a day a week a year everyone that has passed you your life has been spared and you don't think about it oh you think well maybe I wouldn't die but even in an accident anyone who's been in an accident and no you can break a leg break an arm even if you break a wrist your life is changed you lose an eye or you have some Hemorrhage in the brain or something your life has changed forever and every time you get into a car you are at that risk and hoping that these systems work for you right how many here's the scarier one how many child molesters are there in society a good exercise not a good exercise a very sad exercise if you have to go into South African schools today and ask a class of 30 children just ask them to write down on a piece of paper write down five things that make you sad I'm telling you we've done this so I'm telling you I know what I'm talking about 50 of those children have been abused fifty percent minimum of every class and today more than likely almost 50 percent of those children come from broken families broken marriages divorced cases of that so I'll ask the question again how many child molesters are there in society could it be the person who greets you at the toe at your closest supermarket or the teacher who teaches your child or the tutor who you send your child to for piano lessons or the driver who takes your car to your child to school do you know yet you are using these systems hoping your child is safe for six hours or eight hours away from you every single day you are hoping these systems work you're hoping that person who's with your child is has an individual conscience respects the law and he's afraid to go to jail and that that person believes in God and will not want to do any harm to your child you were hoping those three systems work for you every single day we let our kids out of our sight in the hands of teachers family members most children abused are abused by family members in this country and around the world and family members are the ones you trust in the ones you say it's impossible they could never have done that they cannot be more than likely if your child comes to you and gives you a story you will say no you are lying stop lying that's why it continues until they come to adulthood and hate you for not believing them but we're expecting those three systems to work for us how many people you pass each day are criminals at heart you'll never know but you walk with nervous Faith hoping they all keep to at least one of those three philosophies so that they won't grab your purse or your Satchel your bag or steal something from you or mug you or beat you in the street you don't know if they're criminals but you're hoping every day you step out of your doorsteps walk on the street walk to the shop walk from one office another every person that's passing you we are hoping they at least respect one of those three philosophies and that you'll be safe outside of your house right did you realize how you depended on these modern systems now that we've got that out the way leaders of each philosophy so leaders of the religious philosophy leaders of the political philosophy leaders of the free thinkers who believe in individual conscience each leader believes his science or his faculty is the right one to govern people right so each leader thinks that their element let's call it their element the free thinkers think that individual conscience is more important than religion and politics the politicians think that politics and law is more important and and can properly rule Society the Christians the churches the religious people think if people just believed in God everything will be fine now if you had to ask people in the country for Solutions on how to solve society's problems leaders of politics will say we believe we need to make better laws better laws will help religious leaders believe getting people closer to God will help get them more into church let's have more church services let's have more prayer meetings more church services and more prayer meetings have not proven to do the right thing for people you've had some of the worst offenders come from the most religious of people many free thinkers means people who are atheists who don't believe in God and whatever believe in man's morality they believe morality begins at home and believe that Humanity's problems will be solved if we educate our children and our parents better scientists believe that people should be more highly educated and then Society will be a better place so all these groups believe the solutions lie with their Specialties and each group wants to increase the way they deal with their specialty and they believe that their specialty uh is the best and all the problems in society lies with the other ones do you understand so churches believe the fault of society fault in society or excuse me the reason Society is so bad is because of the politicians and the free thinkers the free thinkers believe it's all the religious people's faults right and the politicians well they disagree with everybody including their own politicians so if we live in an Ideal World right when it should take a perfecting of all three philosophies if if we looked in an ideal world and what we're hoping for then all three philosophies will have to have their best ideas to make society live at peace okay and you would think well you know there are countries there are countries like let's take Singapore who grew up under Mr Lee Kuan Yew who really took that country cleaned it up they have like if you lit in the streets just throwing a paper on the floor in Singapore you get a thousand dollar fine so you walk to Singapore it's spotless if you vandalize somebody's property you get smacked with a cane they call it the rattan so they believe in corporal punishment heavy fines speed limit the highest speed limit in Singapore is like 80 kilometers an hour and and probably only on like two freeways or something so and the rest of the place everyone is driving really slow then they have this thing called a mass Rapid Transit they call it the MRT train you can you don't even need cars in Singapore you can just and you you think well that's a system we should have in South Africa you know the respect no littering no this no that you know what's the problem Singapore is an island they don't even have a population like we have it's easier to control a small amount of people now spread it across a large massive piece of land with people living everywhere how many years is it going to take you to get a policy to a person in the north of our country who doesn't even understand your language how are you going to do that you can't adopt Singapore's philosophy in a place like South Africa it's not going to work are you with me so if we lived in an Ideal World then it would take perfecting of all these three philosophies to have an ideal Society so we have to ask ourselves these questions are you still with me don't worry about the technology here they're trying to get things going I think one of those UPS's beeps like crazy so just try and uh look away from that so ask ourselves these questions do you believe you are a moral person do you believe you are one of those people that will never do anything to endanger another person that you are driving towards that you are always going to do the right thing every single day and you will never endanger the life of any pedestrian or car or any person or poor mother and child in a car do you believe you are that moral person who do you think uh why do you think you are a moral person is it because of God is it because of the laws of the land is it because you're a nice person is it because you had a nice upbringing a good upbringing what is it why are you a moral person does everyone around you believe you are a good moral person and respect you as one of the highest people in society is your religion the answer for the present world is your religion the answer for the present world is your tradition the answer for the present world is your knowledge and concept of God the right one or the wrong one or the only one has your personal belief and philosophy of Life worked perfectly for you is it working perfectly for you right now is your life exactly how you think it should have been lived do you live with depression or sadness or deep regrets of the past and the last question question number 12 do you fear death all right so if you are an honest person you'll see that based on your own answers it is impossible for society to get Humanity to a place of being truly moral because when you answer these questions you realize no matter how good you are as a person whether you're a pastor of a church Deacon or whatever you'll realize how many of these we actually lack in and that when we step into our cause people are depending upon me and I'm not exactly a person everyone can depend on you admit we have flaws well one of those flaws is a lot of people have very bad eyesight and should never be driving a car but they trust their eyesight and you do too apparently it sounds like we're all a bunch of fools doesn't it so even if they answer all the questions in their moral and all of that but they have a bad eyesight or someone whose muscles lock every now and then on his right leg where you press the accelerator you know how many people had that condition but don't worry we're trusting them religions have tried and failed some believe true spirituality and Holiness is acquired by staying away from the world so there are there are denominations in the world who believe rather live in the countryside using Ox cart no accidents right until after 10 years you get an ox who's rebellious and who wants to gore you with his horn the first chance he gets and trample you into the mud those things happen by the way beliefs of abstinence in other words staying away from things staying in the mountains being a priest or a monk not eating vile foods not partaking in sexuality or so they claim having no greed or want of anything Etc does that make them moral because they don't do physical or they don't physically do bad things does not make them moral they can still think it and the first chance they get they're going to do something so not doing something and yet Desiring it is still being immoral inside I think we spoke about that recently in the middle of the road so how is staying away from everything more moral than actually having a wife raising a family and living decently among people hey in a troubled world how is it more moral you find a person you understand what I'm saying you get someone who says stay away from everything don't touch a woman don't touch a man don't have money don't desire anything live poor live in the mountains be a monk you know all of that is that a better person than someone who actually does all that and stays decent who is stronger which is the stronger one the one who stays away from everything or the one who stays amongst everything and remains decent who is it you see human philosophies humans thinking is that guy there must be really holy to do all that he must be holy no you don't have to be holy to do that you can just be brainwashed it's really simple do you know how to how to get soldiers Brother Martin can probably tell us if you anyone was in the army to get a person to shoot another person on command requires brainwashing that your sergeant majors Colonels and Generals have been taught to do the first thing they do is they demoralize you when you get there in the Army they've got you come there thinking well I'm a pastor's son I come from a good Society you know I'm a good person that General is going to make you feel like dirt is going to make you feel equal he's going to call you maggot he's going to call you all kinds of names demoralize you until he flattens all the things that you thought about yourself when you feel equal to all these people then it starts making you charm things brainwashing you and the next thing you know you are going to shoot on command without thinking he's going to get you to believe you're a soldier and don't worry about the life you are taking because you are taking an order and you are doing the right thing for your country that's how a soldier is taught and at the end you're you're a person who's brainwashed into taking another life and believing you've done the right thing how is it ever the right thing it's not right and yet today even with with the religious systems you don't see it's the same thing as long as you are you are Charmed to that you are forced into something you are forced to to keep certain laws you are just brainwashed that's all there's no faith involved it's not Holiness to to be stuck in the mountains stay away from society don't eat this don't eat this don't do this because the first time you take that person and stick him in it he's gonna break every single law he had he's not going to cope because staying away from things does not make you holy are you with me and what is Holy holy means set aside for God's purpose I mean God's purpose is definitely not staying in the mountains doing nothing and chanting God's name every day that's not God's purpose God's purpose was let my light shine to all the world go into the world and give them the gospel not stay in the mountains and behave like there's nobody in the world so there are other religions that parts of Christianity that believe you should not touch technology like the Mormons I want to show them or the Amish people so at the moments the Amish people in America stay away from society don't deal with any technology don't use phones just work with wood in your hands and they have a very pleasant Society but it doesn't make that system moral because there's a lot of immorality that goes on there right so we find that there's absolutely no way that Society can ever get this right now I'm not a preacher of Doom quite to the contrary if you take so let's go back to that thing of the driver who's coming towards you remember you were expecting that driver to have individual conscience to respect the law politics yes and to believe in God three things and you're hoping it works for him yes now you just have to add one thing in which is alcohol he's drunk the moment he's drunk all three philosophies fail if you just add now we're not even talking about drugs and other things let's just talk about alcohol consumption can home education prevent you from abusing it can religion prevent you from abusing it can political laws of this country do it absolutely not because the political laws of this country actually allow the breweries to continue mass production of alcohol so if you add one thing one thing alcohol to a human and he becomes addicted to it every other philosophy to keep you safe is out the door right and you know why there are so many accidents over Christmas because there are that many more drunk drivers are you with me so if you just take alcohol consumption here is just one thing that Society has absolutely no control over forget about smoking and the sign that says if you're under 18 you're not allowed to the signs are all there and the shopkeeper still serves it to these people to the 16 year olds why he wants money he wants more money and the poor 16 year olds really want to smoke it I want no idea why they want a full day headspace with smoke you know it's just one thing right society when a person is under the influence of alcohol he will disregard his own conscience he's not in control of his own conscience and his religion and crash into you and kill you and not know what he's done until you get sober and every time you're in your car every day you're hoping the person coming towards you is not drunk you say okay the solution is stop drinking altogether do you think right now anywhere in the world you can ban alcohol I mean surely with all the education we have we should be able to have people thinking we should ban alcohol drugs we should right but if you banned alcohol today you would turn the world upside down and undo a 5 000 year old tradition of drinking religion would have tried to stop the act of buying it and consuming it politics would have to stop the production of it science would have to stop finding new methods to refine it and make it tastier which means a very large portion of society would lose their jobs do you know how many people in this country work to make legal alcohol Millions or thousands Maybe in the breweries and how many different types of breweries are there the first is the wine makers then there's the Brandy makers and the whiskey makers and the beer makers and the ale makers and the spirits makers and ah the list goes on and on there are so many companies it's all humans are so brainwashed you cannot have a single party or wedding without alcohol you can't have a restaurant without alcohol you can't have fine dining without alcohol nobody knows if you take alcohol away from a corporate function or a party nobody knows what to do people today can't even have a conversation without having alcohol so humans can't do without alcohol anymore in their lives do you think any government that comes in is ever going to stop alcohol production not a chance which means our lives are in Peril every single day because people are drinking alcohol and whenever that happens everything stops philosophy one philosophy two philosophy three goes out the door it's done it's over you are not safe on the road take those child molesters we're talking about if they had a drink if they took their drugs those people have lost their minds already and now you give them a substance that makes it over and done with or they've been giving them medication and their medication is getting weaker so the solution is not even to stop it we can't stop it we literally cannot stop something that is killing us no no what we cannot we won't we won't stop it parents religion would say stop the act of buying it politics will say stop would have to stop the production science would have to stop making it tastier restaurant should never sell it parents wedding or parents should never ever consume it parents should never come home and say well let's just have a beer no right parties weddings get-togethers would have to find something else to make them Merry what's that going to be sweets let's go out for some sweets at the sports game anybody wants a sweet chocolate maybe chocolate is good you know what custard danishes they're really good you should try them sometime restaurants should never sell the idea of fine dining with change how can they have duck all around without wine hey and they're oysters and all that without wine it's just not going to be right they're not going to have it and yet the most common sense thing to do to stop alcohol in this in the world we cannot do it but what do we do we have to we have to Perfect all the other systems so we can also control alcohol you're hoping people would drink moderately you're hoping they'd have enough and not overdo it you're hoping they would not have a depressed life and overdo it you're trusting the individual's conscience and people you know if you took away alcohol they just find other substances you know in Mexico they have this this cactus I mean it's the yuckiest thing you've ever seen the cactus literally has this glue that comes out of it like a like a paste icky doesn't even feel right and they're making alcohol out of that they fermented to can you imagine sucking on a paste that's intoxicating and yet men will do it you can't stop it you just stop one substance they'll find another one people will do it there's no solution the world has for this problem in hundreds of years the best the Bible can tell you is have a little wine for thy stomach's sake in the days when they had no probiotics uh or don't touch it at all the Bible can can tell you that a drunken man should never be in the presence of the Lord the Bible tells us things that's all it can do is advise you but there's no way the Bible would even tell Moses to stop the production of alcohol in the in the land of Canaan you would never ever find because humans are never going to do it let's look at our churches okay churches run by the same philosophies we don't even realize it when we come in here we depend on people's individual responsibility keep your children quiet don't chew gum keep the Cod dress decently sit in order rise when the person tells you to write sit down when they tell you to sit individual conscience be gentle be kind be forgiving speak nicely are you with me we depend on people's individual responsibility conscience to support the church to help guide others to be kind and gentle to be forgiving and live as examples to others here and outside in their lives so if you are seen in public people see you are dressed decently you are behaving correctly you're a member of that church you're an outstanding member we're expecting everyone's individual conscience to work same system usually churches teach Doctrine religion that is in keeping with our laws that we set for a sovereign Church it would make more sense if laws were made based on Doctrine we would think right laws of the country but again over time these three philosophies fail and it leads the church into disarray right we set laws over our congregations with threats of not making it in the Rapture or not making it to heaven and promising the hope of a better life on Earth and if you follow the laws you'll have a better life you will follow the laws you'll make it to Heaven those are the laws we're teaching them it's kind of like the politics right and the churches must teach Doctrine we why do we go to this church because we like this Doctrine better than the other one see it would make more sense if the laws were based on Doctrine but again over time like we said the philosophies fail the church goes into disarray Doctrine can never be kept for more than a few years you know why because new understanding always suffices and doctrines have to be adjusted so you have the people Society changes and old laws are never strong enough to govern new generations continuously and have to be discussed to change now by the time you can get a church to have a meeting to discuss whether a Doctrine should be adjusted because societies change children have changed the next generation is coming can be adjusted to who's going to adjust it who has the right to adjust it that's when you end up for 50 years and finally you have these old men with gray beards standing there no no no no we've got to still keep what sent so-and-so said it never works because two sides will prevail those who insist on keeping old laws just uh as they were 50 years ago and those who insist on changing laws who is right I mean that's what happened in the message 50 years later after the prophet is gone who has the right who are you that's the first question message Believers will ask you who are you brother Alistar to change the laws are you saying it the way the prophet said it do you know how many people you can have the most corrupt person in the church tell you you are wrong on COD and tell you you have no right you're not saying what the prophet said therefore you cannot change the laws first question I ask them is where did Brother Bear make a law he didn't even do what it's the preachers that came after him that decided to enforce things that they thought were laws on anything show me one place where the Prophet tells you how to police a law how much time do you give a person to excommunicate them for a specific offense whose discretion is it where is that in COD it's not there which means it's been adjusted by Church governing bodies by Church boards by a deacon board by the pastors it's been and over time the the problem that people have had is why does that church do it that way and our church does it this way why does that church handle this why does that church not excommunicated we excommunicate everybody see who is right parenting always gets more relaxed over time in churches because we get relaxed parenting gets relaxed and therefore we see eventually an absolute upheaval of an entire original belief or faith what am I saying to you after 50 years you suddenly get a message charged with children who don't want to believe the message how did that happen let's take our homes how many of you know that you handle your homes with the same three philosophies in a home you unknowingly follow the same philosophies individual conscience laws religion just maybe in your house you enforce one stronger than the other one so if I have to ask your children they'll be more honest than you who sets the laws in your house they'll tell you whether it's mommy or daddy they know who enforces it they'll tell you whether it's mommy or daddy right who sets the laws in your house who sets the Family's religion you do right you set down the laws you set down a Family's religion husbands and wives kind of speak together and see which laws work for them and they make it known to the children how do you police those laws right how do you deal with an offense when your child breaks a law what do you do when you break the law you expect everyone in the family to understand that the way you set things out was not selfish and it was for the good of the entire family does it work you know one of the best things to do with parents is your child asks you but why are you allowed to do that well because I'm an adult and that's supposed to work it doesn't work absolutely not just ask your teenagers teenagers are the first one to tell you no if it's not good for me it's also not good for you have you heard this one I'm I'm almost an adult I like those ones because then I could say well you can almost do it there it's a lot of fun parenting is a lot of fun and children don't worry you'll become parents one day and go through the same mess we go through so unbelief I remember what we're talking about is our belief versus modern systems right overcoming the mind of today's world and what we're understanding is that we've actually been sort of sucked into believing in these World Systems and making them work for us and we don't realize how much they stress us out because they don't really work and every now and then we know of someone who has lost their lives their life because the system failed so what is the problem and is there a solution there is this this common condition in man you might have heard about it it's called unbelief it is an ancient evil nature and I want you to listen carefully that began by man denying his maker that's where it started and denying truth unbelief now this is what the Bible identifies sin as unbelief amen true immorality is not the stuff that people do that is wrong true immorality is denying the original god-given human ability to believe and have faith the reason parenting doesn't work for you is that your children secretly don't believe you or the laws you lay down there's something about humans they work by belief they just don't always know it right they if your children don't believe you they won't follow your laws it's not about God it's not about any children are watching you they need to believe you everything in your house works on belief they don't if they don't see truth in it because the way you presented to them is untruthful they're not going to believe it and they will not see any value in following it the reason Society doesn't wholly follow the laws of the political party that the politic political government sets out is because at heart the country the society doesn't believe in the law they don't they only agree to it for the sake do you understand that half of the laws in this country you don't believe in you just agree for the sake of peace to do it and it frustrates you right and if you are to sit down with your friends I don't know how many times I've sat down with people and just listened to them all govern the country you can be at some event you can meet with parents at a at a school function or you know or a child's party and there's all the dads there talking and I love those times because I just like to sit and observe but I I listen to them all and everyone knows how to govern the country there everyone knows the political party is wrong and this one is wrong that one is wrong everybody knows every man believes he can he can what does that tell me I'm sitting there thinking not one of you actually believes in the laws you just follow it because you don't want to be arrested and so far it works for you to a certain degree so you don't really believe in it but you follow it and that's what a lot of church people do so they only agree for the sake of peace and for a season but as soon as they see it doesn't work for them they ditch it instantly or when you are pushed into a corner have you seen a person pushed into a corner A desperate person he's going to break every single law because in that moment he feels he's Justified because he's desperate and a desperate person will do anything to spare his life in that moment be it breaking a law or denying God Peter see so when you pushed in the corner when there's a drastic needle you're forced to make a critical decision you will do what you feel is good for you even if the law prohibits it am I right your child is choking on something you're going to break every law getting them to the hospital and maybe you you put on your hazard lights for your car thinking well people should understand this is an emergency and I'm driving at the highest speed I'm I'm going through every red light and we're just trusting we're going to get there safe your child is choking on something I mean you don't think driving it so recklessly you might kill all of you including your child what do you do it's because you feel in the moment you are Justified to break every single law in that moment you have lost all belief in the system the reason your church people eventually don't believe in your religious laws is because it's too far-fetched and these are the words of Christ it's too far-fetched in your presentation of it I mean if you still continue preaching heaven like how your ancestors did your children are eventually going to look at you like I got to be careful what I say right here um well um your children are going to look at you like you believe in fairy tales I was about to speak or criticize certain men of Christmas and Easter bunny the tooth Mouse anyway you become parents like that you become people like that who you paint this picture of this God in heaven with these angels and all of these things that you you're preaching this fantasy eventually your children can look at you and think wow you're crazy they're not going to believe you anything they're not going to believe anything you say why because the teachers at school are making a lot more sense than you you can't come to your child and say listen dinosaurs don't exist because there's no dinosaurs in the Garden of Eden and your child will say but they found bones bone big bones no these lies they made it up but they proved it with science sorry this is of the devil that's the best way for your child to to disbelieve in you and walk away from Faith altogether because you're still upholding some fantasy right you're not getting into the word so these are the words of Christ he says the the religious people the Pharisees they put a burden on the people too heavy for the people to bear and the religious leaders themselves won't even move a finger to hold that burden that's in Matthew chapter 3. so in the place of Truth you teach tradition culture observing of days and times and years that's Galatians 4 and you'll lead the minds of people to bondage instead of freedom this was the biggest trial of the Lord Jesus Christ himself to get people to believe you want to know that it's all about belief belief John 4 48 if you have your Bibles you can read then say Jesus unto him except you see signs and wonders you will not believe John 8 45 46 and because I tell you the truth you believe me not because I tell you the truth you believe me not it's like people were more willing to believe a lie which of you convinced me of sin in other words would one of you can accuse me correctly of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me this is the Lord himself asking Society John 3 12 if I have told you Earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things uh what I'm telling you is the Messiah himself was having trouble getting people to believe John 6 35-36 and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger he that believeth on me shall never thirst but I say unto you that you also have seen me and believe not so those people who say seeing is believing you have seen the Messiah and you believe not John 12 47 48 If any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not for I come not to judge the world but to save the world he that rejected me and received my words hath one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day it will be the word the judges Mark 16 14 afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and operated them that means he was uh chastising him criticizing them uh would they he upgraded them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart the disciples because they believed not he's he's talking about after the resurrection Mark 16 upgrading them because they believed not after the resurrection because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen because people came and said hey the seven seal is open what we know we don't under we don't believe that he's a what are you mad why would you who are you you're just uh you're just a woman Mary Magdalene why should you I'm I am one of the favorite disciples he should have appeared to me first the revelation of the 17 should have come to me first because I've read in this message longer because that matters that's what Christ criticized them for they had this disarray remember the two on the main the way to Emmaus they were saying and what of these people some said there are some women of our company who said they've seen him others said they saw angels others said they saw this we don't know what to believe what was his words oh fools slow of heart Mark 6 5-6 and he could do he could there do no Mighty work save that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and heal them and he marveled because of their unbelief that means the Messiah himself is standing there the Creator the word made flesh and he could do no great Miracles because of the amount of unbelief I are you understanding your Bible God's power was not even going to move because of the amount of unbelief he found amongst the people that's the problem I want to break that down to you before we close Christ had to teach to help remove unbelief I want to ask you how can we ever remove unbelief from society do you even know what an unbeliever is teaching is meant to make the truth plain teaching is meant to make it's not meant to confuse people it's supposed to bring the truth right those who were able to believe by hearing the word received the blessing of knowing who God really was in that time those who believe by hearing the truth right listen remember the the Samaritan uh the Samaritan woman who met Jesus by the well this is you know oftentimes we just talk about the conversation between Christ and the woman at the well we never get to the part where she goes off into the town afterwards and say come see a man who told me everything and she doesn't stop testifying testifying and some people heard her and begin to believe what she was saying verse 39-42 and many of the Samaritans of that City believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever I did people started believing just because of her testimony verse 40. so when the Samaritans would come unto him they besought him they looked for him that and they they asked him to to stay with them to teach them and he Abode there two days we never usually talk about this he stayed with the Samaritans two days and verse 41 and many more believed because of his own word not the lady's word because of his own word and said unto the woman those people now said to the woman now we believe not because of thy saying but we have heard for ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the savior of the world we have heard him and we believe for ourselves not just because someone told us they became believers imagine he couldn't even find this faith in his own hometown and why because the people from the hometown said Dad talk to you Joseph and Mary's son the carpenter why should we believe you right it's it's like humans think they can uh make value to to truth based on what they know all right so let's close this down many people who do not understand what the message is assume the message is another religion or cultish set of rules it isn't though unfortunately many miserable people who think they understand the message live it that way like a cult to their own shame what is commonly known as the message in our churches consists of two basic parts right so what is the message the message is the unraveling of it's two parts to the message unraveling all the false truth we once believed in and the second parties introducing the truth that we should believe that's the message right so that means exposing all that Christianity once believed that is not true and not biblical and then revealing what is true and biblical right so it's so simple and yet so powerful in that all that it does for us is restores the ability to believe again and no truth when we see it that's what the message is now I didn't even know what way to to round up the series benefits of the message but I want to in this last few minutes show you what the benefits of the message really is and it's you can put it in one simple line the message makes you a believer and I want to show you how valuable it is to be a believer because you lived your life as an unbeliever and everyone in this world is living their lives as unbelievers okay let's break that down the message gives you the ability to believe again and you say to me but also I always believed I always believed something I always believe I believe something before the truth is you didn't you were an unbeliever you didn't have the ability to believe you reasoned you agreed with things for the sake of peace and Harmony or you agreed with things because they kind of worked for you but did you believe it you cannot believe something unless you are physically a believer the message makes you biologically a believer right there's the problem being able to believe beyond what Society sees gives us the ability in other words what is the message the message introduces you to something you can believe beyond what Society sees and when you are able to do that you are able to be more than what Society is amen for there to be let me give an example for there to be a happy marriage two people have to believe in each other it's not even love you can love anything you can love anybody you can love a lot of people I can ask two people in a marriage counseling do you love each other yes you know I love you I love her I love him I asked this question do you believe in them and that's a problem because if there's unbelief in a marriage in a relationship it's not in harmony believing in God makes you able to believe in your wife it makes you a biological believer that's the benefits of the message I know you don't even recognize the value in it yet people don't for there to be a happy marriage requires two people to believe in each other unbelief let's think about what does unbelief do if you have unbelief for your wife or unbelief for your husband what does it bring distrust jealousy selfishness Pride arrogance and a whole lot of other negative attributes of unbelief if you want to restore relationship you restore belief in the person you can't make someone love you I mean how many chocolates and teddy bears can you possibly buy roses carnations I think those are for death I'm not sure carnations or lilies I don't know but anyway it doesn't matter what and you know flowers doesn't work for some people because we have allergies it's not going to make people love you you can buy gifts until you blew in the face or until you crack your bank account it's not going to make someone love you there has to be belief how do you get belief back when belief was taken away by Original Sin if you can't believe God you can't believe anything you only reason belief brings now as unbelief brings distrust jealousy and all those things attributes of unbelief what are the attributes of belief what are the attributes of believing Trust Grace forgiveness and so much more leads to true love in a marriage with belief with belief there are no regrets in life no fear of death No Lack of wisdom no end to possibilities if you believe there's no end to possibilities life can Crush around you but because you believe in each other it's honey it's you and me against the whole world no matter what happens we will survive we will make life work do you see how that is disappearing today I remember those old times when you just had two people two people in a in a plot of land and in one year there's a house there Cottage wooden Cottage and the next thing there's some animals and you talk about hardships freezing cold Winters no electricity no running water anywhere and the next thing you know just two people who believe in each other and a generation begins what's happening today no we can't make it we don't have enough in the bank we don't have a bond we don't have this we don't have that what is all that we don't we don't we don't have we don't have we don't have that's unbelief because belief has endless possibilities this is the reason that living with unbelief is sin against God and a sin against nature and yourself Amen in conclusion our belief is what defines who we are in every aspect of life and determines our happiness in life we do not need individual consciences those three philosophies we have the mind of Christ why do I need my individual conscience when I have the mind of Christ I have his conscience right we do not need politics and the rule of law the government is upon his shoulder if I can believe the government on his shoulder following the laws of this land is nothing for me because I respect his government I believe in his government so applying these laws of the land to me is is nothing it's easy I don't have a problem with it I don't have a problem falling in line with it because falling in line with him is far more important than anything else we don't need religion to guide us because we understand his divine nature what religion can possibly teach me when I have his holy spirit what religion what message church with its Theory can top the divine nature in me nothing there's no church with its laws that can teach me anything when I have his divine nature his holy spirit because the baptism of the Holy Ghost made way for the person of Christ in me nobody has to police me because when I do something wrong I police myself nobody's going to force me to go apologize to my wife or apologize to my husband or make things right because inside of me that Holy Spirit is telling me what to do it's leading me it's guiding me because the word says sons of God are led by the spirit of God we don't require religion we don't require people or a church to Define and Rule what we do neither do I as a pastor dictate to you you judge people what to do to follow my rules if I had to do that I'm I'm going against the very thing I believe in there is a difference between believing and being convinced of something our belief is what saves us our belief is what heals us our belief is more important to us than anything else we believe in God and his word and that is what guides our thoughts our intentions our reasoning our communication our belief is not in modern systems our belief is in the word first so what I'm saying to you is if everybody in the world believed in the word of God you wouldn't need any systems it's that simple why do we need systems because we're trying to govern unbelievers and that's why systems keep failing and have to keep readjusting being believers we are born every one of us with I am closing now we are born with a blank slate all of you are a blank slate when you are born you're a baby you're a baby with a clean mind you know nothing about the world you know nothing about you don't know sin you don't know righteousness you don't know anything you don't even know God you don't know religion you don't know Christianity nothing you're just a blank slate you're a blank page right and you come as a blank slit and the world turns you into a doubter a liar a fearful person full of anxiety and woes from the first five years of your life imagine taking a blank page and scribbling all over that's what they do to children today that's what the world does just scribbling nonsense all over this beautiful blank page believe in the word makes us believers now I want you to think about that we so casually call ourselves Believers you know when some young man tells me you know brother Al I meant to go and I asked him well is she a believer they'll say well yes she's a Believer what makes her a believer the fact that she's in a message Church what's a Believer we believe in William Branham that doesn't make you a believer that makes you reason that William branham's message works for you what makes a believer does she believe in the word does he believe in the word I want you to know being a Believer is not even related to the message it's a natural biological condition men used to be at one time believers they lost being Believers because of the original sin and then biologically we became unbelievers we come into this world filled with doubt suspicion can you imagine what life would be like if every one of us were born biologically believers a child would never need flight or fight response do you understand that fight or flight response is a is a biological condition from unbelief if a dog's in front of you and you were Adam what were you going to do because you're an unbeliever your kidneys kick out adrenaline it hits your brain and you start sweating at the hands and then you either stand to fight the dog or you run but if you're a Believer you stand still okay biologically that dog recognizes hold on this guy is the apex predator I can't be growling at him he'll take me out the dog is like you can have a Chihuahua thinking it can take you out today have you seen them they have no respect for mankind there's little things you can fit in the shoebox stand there with I tell you I once I had these two American staffies muscular big dogs and we went to puppy school and this little Chihuahua must have been like that it had a temper like I that thing couldn't even be socialized it was so aggressive and all you could do was so angry it was choking on its own self I was so surprised that a little thing like this could be so angry you meet people like that nowadays frothing at the mouth so angry because someone took their place or something in the queue if I ask you right now what is there in the world I want you all just peacefully quietly consider this question what is there in the world right now that you actually wholly believe in what will your answer be you don't need to answer me just think about it what in the world I actually asked my son this yesterday just to do the test is it science is it education name one thing in the world that you actually wholly believe in you'll find there is nothing and you end up with if you believe in your wife it's going to be a wife your husband your parents the word of God without but anything else nothing you just realize you don't believe in anything else you cannot believe in anything else or to a point you you have something that you think will work for you until but you're in the back of your mind you have this anxiety that it's eventually going to break it's eventually going to let you down you know what I'm talking about do you wholly believe in yourself is that possible to believe that person looking back at you in the mirror if I asked you how many of you wholly believe in your spouse your husband your wife many of you will not be able to answer because you are taught to doubt by the Fallen nature to be jealous to be envious to keep checking on them to keep seeing what they do where they are who they're being with them who they're phoning who they're visiting it's like you've been programmed from the time you're a teenager and you you're dating someone to be neurotic nervous uh like distrustful like they're always going to let you down am I right yes in your heart right now to yourself name one thing in this world that you wholly believe in and you can place 100 faith in it you say to me well brother oh what's the big deal about believing I mean why do we have to believe anyway why do we have to place faith in anything because we are better people when we believe because we find less you know what happens when you believe you find less need to control everything you know half the time you're frustrated because you want to control everything it's a it's a flaw to think you can control everything I'm standing here in front of you using my body I have no control over my heart right now could stop at any moment should I be anxious about it should I do everything in my power to kind of control my heart which I can't even touch with my finger how should it govern my life and that's the problem with unbelief unbelief gives you the need to control everything and the truth is control is an illusion you can't control everything and you're stressing yourself out every day being an unbeliever is biological it's not about the message many successful people find that finding way you look we become better people if we believe because we find if you if you feel in your life I don't need to control everything you find more freedom you find more air to breathe because we lose anxiety and depression when we believe more because we are happy you know what happens if you try to control everybody's life you're the one who gets stressed if you trust them with their own life let them make the mistake Let Them Fall let them crack their heads when they are come to you then you pick them up and put them right again but if you're going to live your life trying to protect them every time they fall you aren't going to go insane it's an illusion to think you can control everybody we are happier people when we believe when we believe enough to trust the next person listen just remember if you go and you make a mistake I'm still here for you I'll never stop loving you I'll still be here for you when you come back it won't change who you are to me but the moment you disbelieve God's word that separates us that's it that separates us because you start losing belief you believe in me and I believe in you we have a better relationship many successful people find that finding ways to be positive you know all the CEOs of the world what do you call us some 500 what is that Fortune 500 people oh almost at Fashion 500. Fortune 500 people and all these they all write books and they all write about positivity and thinking and believing in yourself and knowing you can do it you've heard all that they give the best talks in that and then they charge you thousands for those talks but it really works for them for a long time and it leads to gnosticism right it's where you start thinking too much of yourself can you really believe in yourself can you fully believe in this I just told you I can't even control my own heart my own breathing right now I can't even control my own brain right now how do I believe in myself wholly believe in myself it's another illusion to stand in the mirror and say you can do it today with music playing it's better with music playing you can do it that's not believing that's bluffing yourself that's trying to have positive thoughts you can only truly believe in who you are when you know your place in Christ otherwise you can't because you are lost in a world that is so full of unbelievers you can't find your place anywhere watch a child who goes to a new school for the first time watch yourself go to a new job for the first time watch yourself go find a new client for the first time every time you think you're so positive and so great you're standing with something for the first experience and your hands are sweating your brow is sweating your stomach is churning you actually have to miss a meal because you were so nervous even though you have this great confident CEO it's an illusion it leads to narcissism eventually that person starts looking at himself in the mirror and start admiring himself for everything that goes right he gets a an award when something goes wrong what does he do blames someone else you have to if you're someone who believes in yourself in this world when things go wrong you have to find someone else to blame that's how narcissism works that's how belief in yourself works that's the part they don't write in their books you always have to blame someone else for the wrong things that happen all of them don't care who they are Trump just won that one Joe Biden or silver I'm a poissa all of them fantastic great men governing the country wearing the best suits speaking the best way possible great successes all the wrong things that everyone else's fault not mine narcissism don't fool yourself with that being a believer is being christ-like so you see even though all of us in this world may have a little belief in something and place a little faith in something we are much more unbelievers than believers and it's killing our society more and more we are not trusting in society not trusting in government not trusting in the systems that govern us not trusting friends and family not trusting in ourselves in the message Jesus Christ is saying yesterday today and forever what is sin there's only one sin it's unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already how we know they are only two faith and unbelief you're on one side if you're a Believer you don't smoke drink commit adultery but because you don't just don't make you a believer no sir it's just the attribute the prophet is saying because you don't drink smoke commit adultery that doesn't make you a believer amen it still makes you it still doesn't make you a Believer if you are not doing things what makes you a Believer as long as you are just a human being without the Holy Ghost every day of your life you are plagued by unbelief lack of faith and distrust in the message approach to God I think this is our last quote he says if I started to go home this afternoon and went cut across the fields I find myself sunk down in a mud puddle somewhere the highway hasn't approached Jeffersonville and I must go the way up the highway it's easy running if you'll just get in the road die out to self come through the blood of Christ then you approach the father and he will give you the holy spirit that will make you a believer cause it's not you that's believing anymore is the holy spirit in you your Nature has changed our belief versus modern systems I don't get into my car every morning hoping the other person has individual conscience religion and and he's protecting himself from the law or he respects the law I don't even care about that my faith is in God my belief is in him if it's my time to go I'm not afraid I'm going to live my life every day making what I do worth the while for his purpose and who cares about all other purposes so if something goes wrong in my life in my home I know I believe in my wife I believe in my children I believe we can get it together why do I believe them because I was given the ability to believe by believing in the word of God because I could believe beyond what I see how can you believe in someone who is another personality altogether unless you can believe in God you can never believe in another person see when you believe the word the benefits are unlimited because you become a natural believer in something you learn to overcome doubt it makes you a better person how you become less stressed less suspicious more trusting in God you'll lose the obsession for constant control of everything you don't fear death you don't fear negative things you have faith in all trials you are thankful to God even after a terrible trial your self-healing ability in your mind is enhanced you trust more you forgive easier you form better relationships that are not fake you don't have doubt because you believe your sins are wiped clean by the only one who matters that's what a Believer is tell me that person needs any modern system of this world to be happy it's not someone who thinks they are in the message unfortunately today only the open book can make a believer possible because the everything else is over Christ was 2 000 years ago Jesus Christ two thousand years ago people don't need extra Faith to believe in Jesus Christ they already know He existed all Christians already know in Calvary they know the about the blood of Christ they know about sanctification they know about all that what is it that people need what is it today that is higher than every other belief it's the open book in today's life it's not enough to say I believe in Jesus Christ and he died for my sins the highest belief today is the open book and if you can rise above every other belief to that belief you can believe beyond anything here in this world that's why the message has so much of benefits can you believe that you can be the word made flesh because that's what the open book has come to reveal to you can you believe that and that you were chosen to be the word made flesh think of all the doubt you have to overcome just to come to that state of mind you mean me the word made flesh I mean the open book come down to me think of when you can believe that what else can you believe you will be transformed within and so because we have been transformed into Believers we can believe more in God we can believe more in our wives in our husbands we can believe more in our parents young people we can believe more in our children parents and we can believe more things that matter because of that we can make modern systems work better for us better than it does for everyone else according to the way we believe because we have the right attitude we can have the strength to not let modern systems control us we can have dominion over all those systems instead of them dominating us and taking over our minds I believe that that is what we are called and chosen to fulfill in this world today we have to be severely tried and tested Saints by the difficulties of these systems as everyone in the world so I just want to make this plain to you make you understand what's happening because I don't think it's said often enough and excuse me there's a lot of messy churches in the city there's a lot of message charges in the world but I think this is not said enough what are you supposed to do here you've gotten to this place where we're waiting for the Rapture we're waiting for the translation we're not that's another illusion we're not waiting for that nobody in the world before in the economy of God was waiting for something they had to bring it to pass waiting is the wrong mentality so we got the open book what are we supposed to do with it what's the purpose why would any generation receive the word of God there was always a purpose to receiving the word if Noah received the word there was an ark that was going to be manifested if Moses received the word there was going to be a Mount Sinai there was going to be a Shiloh there was going to be a tabernacle there was going to be a purpose for every word that he sent what is our word for what are we here for to wait for a translation that's some weird purpose right so let me tell you what's supposed to happen you are supposed to believe Beyond yourself you are supposed to go through every single marriage trial that other people go through and you're supposed to overcome it by believing you are supposed to go through parenting problems that pales in comparison to other people and you're supposed to overcome it by believing you are supposed to go through financial difficulties home difficulties life difficulties and you're supposed to overcome it by believing and overcome it doesn't mean make it so much better than I get happy overcoming means living beyond the unbelief it can cause that means you might still live with a very unhappy situation but it's not going to affect your faith that's what finding the middle of the road is about too so we're not running away from it we're not running to a better life but if you become a Believer you can start realizing your life becomes better no matter what situations you face we have to show that because we are believers living with these systems as everybody else the system of money will not corrupt our Spirits the systems of parenting will not take away our children's Faith systems will not turn us into Political corporate hollywood-headed brainwashed beings who cannot stand in the day of trouble True Believer knows and appreciates the wonderful glorious benefits of the message amen the Lord bless you let's bow our heads together
