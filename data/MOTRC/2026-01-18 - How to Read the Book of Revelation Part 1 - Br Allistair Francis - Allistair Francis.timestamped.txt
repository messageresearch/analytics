[0:00] Good evening saints. Like to greet you
[0:02] in the precious name of our Lord Jesus
[0:04] Christ. I'm thankful to be sharing God's
[0:08] word with you once again. It is a
[0:11] special privilege always to be sharing
[0:13] the word with the bride of the Lord
[0:15] Jesus Christ.
[0:17] And um last week we concluded our series
[0:21] on the mark of the beast.
[0:23] And um it's been in my heart for a while
[0:26] to do uh something uh different
[0:30] um especially for the Wednesday nights.
[0:32] We're kind of adjusting
[0:36] you know after co uh the co pandemic
[0:40] uh church kind of changed a little bit
[0:42] for us. So a lot of things adjusted and
[0:45] so um I had
[0:48] a question from uh my son
[0:52] um when we were doing family altars and
[0:56] devotions and so on. So he asked me
[0:58] sometime last year
[1:00] uh he said you know it would be very
[1:04] good for you to take five minutes every
[1:08] day just to read the book of revelations
[1:14] and
[1:16] just show us how you interpret it. How
[1:18] do you read the book of revelations?
[1:22] And so I realized from his question that
[1:24] it is becoming increasingly harder for
[1:27] each new generation to read this book of
[1:30] revelations.
[1:32] So you know I thought for many decades
[1:34] we had many academics
[1:36] academic critics saying the book of
[1:38] revelations was something that contained
[1:40] fables and things too far-fetched.
[1:44] Um there's so much mystery around this
[1:47] book
[1:49] and uh then now we have a generation
[1:52] whose minds have been groomed to be so
[1:55] creative and imaginative
[1:58] that they are fascinated by stories of
[2:01] superpowered heroes, magical creatures,
[2:03] witches, wizards, and a host of other
[2:06] things.
[2:07] you know, it it might occur to you that
[2:09] they may seriously mess up the
[2:12] interpretation of this precious book of
[2:14] prophecy if they become preachers or you
[2:18] know, so not being able to actually read
[2:21] the book and understand it. So how to
[2:25] read the book of Revelation was a
[2:27] question I've not been asked before.
[2:29] It's a new thing. I realize that there
[2:31] are many reasons for such a situation
[2:33] like the words are not written in the
[2:36] way that people speak today. So if you
[2:39] read the new interpreted versions of the
[2:42] Bible
[2:44] like the new international version and
[2:46] the students version and the woman's
[2:48] version and you know all the different
[2:50] kinds of interpretations of the Bible
[2:53] they are written by people with no
[2:55] revelation. So they just find words with
[2:57] similar meanings from a theserus or a
[3:00] dictionary and slot it in for realizing
[3:04] in not realizing they're actually
[3:06] destroying the revelation of the words.
[3:10] So I suppose my son didn't want me to
[3:13] make a sermon of it or to make extra
[3:16] work. That's why he asked me to do 5
[3:18] minutes a day.
[3:21] But I have to move as the spirit of God
[3:23] leads. And that's how things work for me
[3:26] when it starts mulling over in my head
[3:29] and I start to think on it and things
[3:32] begin to form.
[3:35] So I found that the prophet's time that
[3:37] he spent on chapter one of the book of
[3:41] Revelations to be most intriguing.
[3:46] And so I would encourage, you know,
[3:49] every good scholar
[3:51] and student of the message to take the
[3:54] time if you're uh reading chapter 1 of
[3:59] the book of revelations.
[4:02] Um hold this message um it's was
[4:06] preached in December the 4th 1960
[4:08] Jeffville the revelation of Jesus
[4:11] Christ.
[4:13] take that message and read it
[4:15] simultaneously. So if you read um if
[4:19] you're reading from verse one, read
[4:21] there what the prophet says concerning
[4:23] verse one. It's actually quite
[4:25] fascinating the amount of time that he
[4:28] takes and spends on that first chapter.
[4:31] It's beautiful.
[4:33] So I wanted to start with chapter 1
[4:37] verse one today. But then um like always
[4:42] you know things begin to
[4:45] uh form in different ways. So I thought
[4:49] to just have a kind of talk
[4:54] uh to introduce the reading of this book
[4:58] and to to give us first an introduction
[5:03] to why the book is so meaningful to us.
[5:06] So I have no notes
[5:09] and uh I obviously not going to send any
[5:13] notes together with you but I want to
[5:16] share with you concerning the book of
[5:19] revelations
[5:20] what it means to us in this day and the
[5:23] value of the open book. And I want to
[5:26] say from the outset that
[5:29] because of the revelation of the seals,
[5:33] because of the open book, because of the
[5:34] message of the prophet, this book of
[5:37] revelations has become
[5:41] um completely made known to us. There
[5:45] isn't a single secret in there. I've had
[5:48] numerous people telling me that, you
[5:51] know, when they came to our churches and
[5:55] or listen to us preach, it was like we
[5:59] knew everything and they're amazed at
[6:01] the things that we say concerning the
[6:03] book of Revelations because nobody talks
[6:05] about it. I've had people come in from
[6:08] denominations and say that, you know, in
[6:10] their churches they only talk from the
[6:12] Psalms and the Proverbs and nobody
[6:15] touches the book of Revelations and once
[6:17] in a while they may read from it but
[6:19] nobody teaches from it. uh nobody
[6:22] discusses it and it looks like nobody
[6:24] knows anything and they're so amazed
[6:26] that when they come to our church that
[6:30] we speak so freely, we speak with such
[6:32] confidence and they're you they're
[6:35] generally fascinated because we seem to
[6:40] uh this seems to be a second language
[6:42] for us, you know. So, um
[6:46] I want to
[6:48] I want to target this at the young
[6:52] people, the new generation. Uh purely
[6:55] because, you know, my son asked me to do
[6:57] this, but so I want to start the little
[7:01] series and I have no idea how long this
[7:03] is going to take, if I'm going to take
[7:05] three verses at a time or a few, you
[7:07] know, see how it goes. But hopefully
[7:09] we'll keep it up for the Wednesday
[7:11] nights uh for a large segment of this
[7:13] year. So we'll start a series uh how to
[7:17] read the book of Revelations.
[7:20] And uh for today we'll just sort of you
[7:23] know make an introduction uh of this
[7:27] and perhaps just off the top of my head
[7:31] um maybe we can title this talk the
[7:35] value of the book of revelations.
[7:38] And I hope to show you that especially
[7:42] the young people, it's not so much about
[7:47] um explaining prophecies and explaining
[7:52] um doctrines.
[7:54] It's much more than that. And when you
[7:58] understand the the value of it, you'll
[8:01] realize it's the greatest wisdom that
[8:04] exists in the world. it opens up
[8:07] everything.
[8:09] So to begin with, I'd like to read a
[8:11] scripture from
[8:14] uh the book of Revelations. And this is,
[8:16] you know, just a start for a
[8:19] text. I didn't plan this. So uh
[8:22] Revelations 22 the end
[8:26] uh verse 16
[8:29] and the the Bible says I Jesus have sent
[8:33] my angel to testify unto you these
[8:36] things in the churches. I am the the
[8:38] root and the offspring of David and the
[8:41] bright and morning star. And the spirit
[8:44] and the bride say come. Let him that
[8:46] heareth say come. And let him that is a
[8:48] thirst come. And whosoever will, let him
[8:51] take the water of life freely. For I
[8:55] testify unto every man that heareth the
[8:57] words of the prophecy of this book. If
[9:00] any man shall add unto these things, God
[9:02] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[9:05] written in this book. Verse 19. And if
[9:08] any man shall take away from the words
[9:10] of the prophet the book of this
[9:11] prophecy, God shall take away his part
[9:14] out of the book of life and out of the
[9:16] holy city and from the things which are
[9:19] written in this book.
[9:22] So may the Lord add a blessing to his
[9:24] word and it is the 16th
[9:29] of March
[9:30] 2022.
[9:32] Uh time is really flying and uh so we
[9:38] begin a new series and um how to read
[9:43] the book of revelations.
[9:45] So you know like I said I want to I want
[9:48] to just talk freely as it comes into my
[9:51] head u because I've been I've been
[9:55] teaching this for many years. It's going
[9:57] to be 20 years now. And um it kind of I
[10:03] can't explain to you, but it kind of
[10:06] lives in me because I've been through
[10:09] this so many times. Been answering I
[10:11] answer questions on this literally every
[10:16] week of my life for years. And uh I've
[10:20] had to answer questions from different
[10:23] people and sometimes go through all the
[10:26] teachings over and over again. And uh so
[10:30] I you know without making too much of
[10:34] oneself and I don't mean to do that. I'm
[10:36] just trying to say to you that it's been
[10:39] the thing that that's become a part of
[10:41] me and that's why I the best way I know
[10:45] is to just speak as I feel inspired, you
[10:49] know, without trying to type it all out.
[10:51] It would take too long and I'd overthink
[10:53] it. And so I hope that it would be a
[10:56] blessing to you. So one of the main uh
[10:59] reasons I wanted to take this approach
[11:01] was because
[11:04] we are right now in the world sitting at
[11:06] the precipice if I would say that way at
[11:09] the brink at the edge of the destruction
[11:13] of the world. Uh, and some people would
[11:16] think, you know, wow, you're just a
[11:18] prophet of doom, you know, you're just a
[11:21] a Christian um
[11:24] hack, you know, prophet. And I'm I'm not
[11:27] a prophet. I don't have any spiritual
[11:30] gifts. All I can do is read the word,
[11:33] teach the word, and that's as much as I
[11:35] have. So, I don't claim to have any
[11:37] gifts of of any other kind. So, not at
[11:41] all. I'm not any kind of prophet or
[11:44] prophet of doom. Um, but some of you may
[11:47] not realize this or even know this.
[11:50] There's something called the doomsday
[11:53] clock which was something uh formed by
[11:57] Einstein and um you know the physicists
[11:59] and scientists around him at that time.
[12:03] And um
[12:05] so you know they they designed this
[12:09] thing called the doomsday clock. And you
[12:11] may have remembered that uh brother
[12:14] Brandham spoke about 3 minutes to
[12:16] midnight and the scientific clock.
[12:20] And um so maybe you didn't understand
[12:23] what that was, but it was this um
[12:27] calculation based on news events and
[12:31] things around the world where scientists
[12:33] were creating
[12:36] uh calculations, mathematical
[12:38] calculations.
[12:41] um well to kind of show how close the
[12:44] world is to nuclear war and to the
[12:48] destruction of the earth. And um they
[12:54] believed it was a big thing. And you
[12:55] know at that time they formed the United
[12:57] Nations and uh many other things to you
[13:01] know organizations like NATO a little
[13:03] later to to sort of control this u um
[13:09] the world from or prevent the world from
[13:13] bringing um atomic warfare.
[13:17] And so that's what this is. And and I
[13:19] don't know if you if you sometimes check
[13:22] on it and what scientists believe, but
[13:25] in January, I think it was January the
[13:29] 20th or somewhere there. Uh and then
[13:33] coming closer now,
[13:35] I think the doomsday clock says we're
[13:39] 100 seconds to midnight. So, uh forget
[13:44] about 3 minutes.
[13:46] uh forget 3 minutes at different times,
[13:50] you know, 3 minutes to midnight in the
[13:52] 1960s and you know, I don't know why how
[13:55] many minutes they had in the ' 70s and
[13:57] so on, but right now in 2022, the
[14:00] doomsday clock, you can Google it. The
[14:03] last I saw it, it was 100 seconds to
[14:06] midnight.
[14:08] Uh so what that means is scientists
[14:11] around the world who you know they they
[14:13] pass down the sort of legacy to one
[14:17] another and there are there's a group of
[14:20] scientists dedicating their lives every
[14:23] year to calculating
[14:25] how close we are to nuclear warfare that
[14:28] could destroy our planet. And right now
[14:31] the present scientists say that we are
[14:33] 100 seconds to midnight. So this is not
[14:37] us being spiritual hacks or doomsday
[14:41] prophets and we're just, you know, been
[14:44] preaching that the world is going to
[14:46] end. No, this is something that is
[14:49] happening right now. And um so this
[14:53] whole issue with Russia and Ukraine and
[14:57] the world reeling as it is, it's no
[15:00] surprise to us because those of us that
[15:03] have studied the word, those that are of
[15:06] us that are conscious of the prophecies
[15:08] of the book of Revelation,
[15:11] uh have been always aware that this was
[15:14] going to happen. I mean, we've heard the
[15:16] prophet himself
[15:18] speak about this so much and uh you
[15:21] might have seen in the weeks since the
[15:23] invasion of Ukraine, you'd have seen a
[15:26] lot of people in the message sending out
[15:28] the quotes about Russia and the oil and
[15:31] you know the moment Russia invaded
[15:33] Ukraine, I just told our family just
[15:35] here it is. It's going to start coming.
[15:37] You know, everyone start sending you
[15:38] quotes about Russia and oil and and this
[15:42] and that. So, uh, what I'm trying to say
[15:44] to you is it's it's not a a great
[15:47] surprise for us.
[15:50] So, what I want to, um, kind of bring in
[15:54] is what the book of Revelations
[15:58] actually tells us. And I know that those
[16:02] of you who are in the youth and the
[16:05] young people and my son's age group,
[16:07] when you look at the the book of
[16:09] Revelation, it looks like this this
[16:11] mammoth task to read this book. It looks
[16:15] like this this book with confusing
[16:18] symbology and and you know uh statements
[16:22] and you come to church and you hear the
[16:25] the preachers talk about it. Seven
[16:27] seals, seven thunders, seven vials,
[16:29] seven trumpets, and it's all so
[16:31] complicated. And this minister tries to
[16:34] explain it that way, and that one tries
[16:36] to explain it this way. And they talk
[16:38] about son of man. And and uh you know,
[16:42] the church ages and sometimes uh you
[16:46] know, preachers just make it look so
[16:48] flat and boring just because they
[16:50] reading quote after quote after quote.
[16:52] And you know, you don't really get and
[16:56] and the more you hear all of this, you
[16:58] kind of look at it and think, "Oh my
[17:00] word, I'm never going to understand
[17:02] this. I'm never going to know what's
[17:04] happening. I'm most likely going to miss
[17:06] the rapture because I'm never going to
[17:09] understand this. These people understand
[17:11] it. These preachers understand it." But
[17:13] then, you know, you get around a little
[17:16] bit and you speak to people and then you
[17:18] realize a lot of people don't understand
[17:20] this book. And some of them who do when
[17:24] they try to explain it, they just make
[17:25] it more confusing.
[17:28] And then some of you youngsters may may
[17:30] say, well, there's so much of fighting
[17:34] around it because nobody seems to have
[17:36] the right interpretation
[17:38] and uh which message church do we listen
[17:41] to? Which denominational church do we
[17:43] listen to? On this, it's probably safer
[17:46] just to leave it alone and whatever
[17:48] happens happens.
[17:50] um you know you can live that kind of
[17:52] life. You can, you know, it's like, it's
[17:55] like if somebody
[17:57] gave you a book that was the secret of
[18:01] life
[18:02] and you had the opportunity to take this
[18:06] book and read it and handle your life
[18:10] such that you can make a better life for
[18:13] yourself and live, you know, a fulfilled
[18:17] life, a happy life and an overcoming
[18:20] life and a and a victorious life And
[18:23] then what instead of doing that you just
[18:25] put this book away and and thought well
[18:28] and think well I just let it be you know
[18:30] whatever happens in life I'm good with
[18:32] that it's better not knowing
[18:35] well I'll tell you that's a very foolish
[18:38] way to
[18:40] to handle your life because
[18:44] uh in a world like today wisdom is the
[18:47] greatest thing you can ever have and
[18:49] wisdom is not excess knowledge
[18:53] Wisdom is not knowing
[18:56] more than other people. Wisdom is how to
[19:00] apply the little knowledge that you
[19:02] have, how to apply it correctly to life
[19:06] situations.
[19:07] Uh that's wisdom. You know, children can
[19:10] have wisdom, babies can have wisdom on
[19:14] knowing how to use their legs, their
[19:17] little legs to run fast enough, but not
[19:21] so fast where they fall flat on their
[19:23] faces. Uh they don't need to have
[19:25] academic knowledge of that, but within
[19:28] themselves, the wisdom that comes from
[19:31] learning, from experiences. So don't
[19:34] think of wisdom as knowing everything or
[19:37] knowing a lot.
[19:40] So that being said, you know what's
[19:42] happening right now is
[19:45] um you have this this great book of
[19:48] revelations which starts from chapter 1
[19:51] and has 22 chapters. And if you you can
[19:55] break the entire book of revelations
[19:57] down and I've done that for you. I will
[19:59] send you um a PDF on that uh soon. and u
[20:04] made it easy for you to to have a look
[20:06] at the breakdown of the book of
[20:07] revelations. So I hope it'll make things
[20:10] easier for you when you see an overview
[20:13] of the book and place things in the
[20:16] different orders and perspectives it
[20:19] that just to make it easier for you to
[20:21] understand as we read the book of
[20:23] revelations going forward for the rest
[20:25] of the year.
[20:27] Uh, and believe me, it's such a a rich
[20:30] book of wisdom that you'll see from next
[20:34] week, I'll probably do just three verses
[20:38] for the one service, the one um um
[20:43] teaching or reading, whatever. I don't
[20:46] even know what to call it.
[20:48] So,
[20:50] I want to start by the current events
[20:54] that are taking place. So right now we
[20:57] have a major conflict in the world. This
[20:59] is where it gets interesting, right? We
[21:02] have a country Russia invading Ukraine.
[21:07] Okay, that's how it starts. And so we
[21:11] we're living in our homes in suburbia.
[21:14] You're I mean you're some city suburb or
[21:16] wherever you are. You're comfortable in
[21:18] your home and uh you're more concerned
[21:22] with how to pay the bills for the month.
[21:24] uh what's happening with the dogs,
[21:27] what's happening with the car, what's
[21:28] happening with your children's
[21:29] education,
[21:31] you know, you're concerned with that and
[21:33] life is rolling on and then the next
[21:35] morning you wake up and you look at the
[21:37] newspaper or you normal newspapers
[21:39] anymore. You you get this ping on your
[21:42] phone and then you look at it and it
[21:43] says Russia invades Ukraine. Well, the
[21:47] next thing you know, for the next 2
[21:49] weeks, you are bombarded with all kinds
[21:52] of theory, fake news,
[21:56] uh, liberal news, conservative news.
[21:58] You've got no idea what to believe.
[22:00] You're hearing all kinds of stories and
[22:03] then, you know, you're just going to
[22:05] work and then you you see things more
[22:08] Russia, Ukraine, Ukraine, Russia, and so
[22:10] on. And then the next week the oil
[22:14] prices go up and the the the the fuel
[22:18] price goes up and you don't know why but
[22:22] then you hear on the radio or you seeing
[22:24] it in the news again on your phone and
[22:26] you
[22:28] and then you see uh well what Russia is
[22:31] doing in Ukraine is affect is affecting
[22:33] us here in South Africa and uh wherever
[22:36] you are in the world and and the the
[22:39] price of oil and then you start hearing
[22:41] things of everybody talking about oil
[22:44] shortage and problems with oil here and
[22:47] problems with oil there and just from
[22:49] one country invading another
[22:54] and the next thing we hear is the price
[22:55] of wheat is going up because of Russia
[22:59] and then we hear sanctions from the from
[23:01] the west from the United States and the
[23:04] UK and and Europe and they're
[23:06] sanctioning Russia and this is creating
[23:09] economic stress all over the world. I
[23:12] mean, we're just simple people living
[23:14] daytoday. What do we care, you know? Uh
[23:17] it's just leave that to the people in
[23:18] the stock markets and those people, the
[23:21] politicians and they go on and and uh
[23:24] what do we care, you know? So,
[23:28] the thing is
[23:31] what these people are doing is affecting
[23:34] us immediately and in the long run. I
[23:38] mean, right now, you don't realize
[23:42] we could go into an absolute economic
[23:47] crash in this year because of what's
[23:50] happening in
[23:52] the Russia and Ukraine. And even worse,
[23:56] we could literally be in World War II
[24:00] within a few months or within a few
[24:03] weeks depending on what reactions the
[24:07] West has uh further for Russia.
[24:11] And uh remember the prophet told us all
[24:16] it takes is some madman to press the
[24:18] wrong button and a nuclear weapon is is
[24:24] launched and that's it. We're into World
[24:26] War II.
[24:28] So, you know, not to sound like a
[24:30] doomsday prophet, but really that's all
[24:33] it takes. And that's where we are right
[24:37] now. That's what kind of a precarious
[24:40] position we are in in the world.
[24:44] So
[24:46] to show you
[24:48] just just in a in a short way, if you
[24:53] look at
[24:55] uh the players that we have right now in
[24:57] the world, right? We've got in the west
[25:00] those who support democracy. We've got
[25:02] the the United States, the United
[25:04] Kingdom, we've got France, Germany, you
[25:07] basically all of Europe. Uh people who
[25:10] support democracy.
[25:12] Then on the other side in the east we
[25:15] have communism which is supported by
[25:19] Russia, China, North Korea and in South
[25:22] America we've got Venezuela.
[25:25] Something you may not know is that
[25:27] Venezuela has the highest reserves of
[25:31] oil right now and they're a communist
[25:33] country run by a dictator. Russia is one
[25:37] of the greatest suppliers of oil right
[25:39] now. And these countries are not allies
[25:43] of democracy. They're not allies of the
[25:45] west. Which means if they apply pressure
[25:49] to the rest of the world and stop
[25:51] providing oil, then prices go up,
[25:55] markets crash, the cost of living goes
[25:58] up for you, the small people of this
[26:01] world. Everything gets more expensive.
[26:03] They have this thing called inflation
[26:05] which affects all of us. Um, it's a word
[26:09] to you and me. It's figures to those who
[26:13] are in finance and uh savings and uh
[26:19] purchasing of vehicles and houses and
[26:22] properties and food and bread and milk
[26:26] and wheat, rice, maze. All of these
[26:29] things go up purely because of these
[26:33] economic stresses caused by things like
[26:36] wars and politics.
[26:39] So you have this west and this east. And
[26:44] if you didn't know in the Bible, the
[26:47] west here is symbolized by the the beast
[26:50] of revelations 13 11-18, right? And in
[26:54] the east in the book of revelations,
[26:56] they are called Gog and Magog or the
[26:59] kings of the north. And brother Bham
[27:01] said they are communism which is a tool
[27:04] in the hand of God to destroy
[27:07] uh the beast of revelations 131-10.
[27:11] Now, so you have the west
[27:15] democracy, you have in the east, you
[27:17] have communism.
[27:19] In the Middle East, you've got another
[27:21] problem. You've got Saudi Arabia, Iran,
[27:24] Iraq, United Arab Emirates, and all the
[27:27] other Middle Eastern countries that are
[27:30] uh basically drenched in oil, the
[27:33] biggest suppliers of oil in the planet,
[27:36] and they are Islamic states. They don't
[27:40] like Christian democracy states and the
[27:44] only reason they have good ties is
[27:46] because they like money
[27:48] and they realize oil is a very precious
[27:51] commodity right now. So a lot of you you
[27:55] know simple people like myself you don't
[27:58] really take notice of things concerning
[28:01] these
[28:03] uh commodities in the world. So oil of
[28:06] course is not your cooking oil. It's
[28:09] called crude oil and it is used for
[28:12] thing it is used for things like fuel
[28:15] uh your petrol your diesel uh and other
[28:18] kinds of oils or or fuels for airplanes
[28:23] and you know other machinery that that
[28:26] is used in the world. And so what has
[28:30] happened in the last few years is you
[28:33] have these democratic countries which
[28:36] have believed that there is this crisis
[28:39] of climate change and they've been
[28:42] trying to stop their production of oil
[28:46] and they want to move to things like
[28:49] wind energy and you know what they call
[28:52] clean energy and uh you know things that
[28:55] don't involve fossil fuels like coal or
[28:58] burning.
[28:59] uh gas and so on. So they've started
[29:03] reducing their or trying to reduce their
[29:06] usage of of of oil to prevent what they
[29:09] call carbon emissions
[29:12] and to save the planet because a lot of
[29:14] them believe the planet only has 12
[29:16] years left. Well, that was 4 years ago,
[29:19] I suppose. 12 years left. Um
[29:23] and um so they have things like what
[29:28] they have thing uh something that they
[29:30] call stockpile oil stock piles or oil
[29:33] reserves in the world and each country
[29:35] calculates
[29:37] uh how much of oil reserves it has. In
[29:40] other words, how much of oil uh it it
[29:43] has left for so many years. So for
[29:45] example, the world right now, the entire
[29:48] world right now with all the calculated
[29:52] oil reserves that we have around the
[29:54] world, that's including Venezuela,
[29:57] Russia, United States, United Kingdom,
[30:00] Ukraine, South Africa, all the countries
[30:04] uh the the United Arab Emirates, Saudi
[30:06] Arabia, all of us together, all the oil
[30:09] that is being produced and stockpiled
[30:12] right now only leaves us with about 47
[30:16] years.
[30:17] That means if things are destroyed, if
[30:21] nuclear disaster happens and so on and
[30:23] nothing and the oil reserves are still
[30:25] intact, the world only has 47 years of
[30:28] oil uh left. The if you take the United
[30:32] States stockpile alone, I think they are
[30:35] probably like 4.9 or roughly 5 years
[30:40] left of oil. The United States
[30:42] themselves
[30:44] have only 5 years left. For South
[30:47] Africa, we have zero.
[30:49] And that's amazing because you don't
[30:51] even know that that's we have zero uh we
[30:55] don't have any oil reserves left. We are
[30:57] depending on other countries
[31:00] um to to supply us. And so that means we
[31:05] you know other countries calculated like
[31:07] for example Venezuela is the highest and
[31:10] um um you know United States is only I
[31:15] think ranked number 11 or something in
[31:17] the world and Russia is in the first 10
[31:22] Iran and the the Arabian countries are
[31:24] in the first five I think. I can't
[31:26] remember all the stats right now, but
[31:29] that's that's where we sit with this
[31:32] whole oil situation.
[31:34] Now, you have these people, right? And
[31:37] so, the Vatican uh city, the Roman
[31:40] Catholic Church, the Vatican City is a
[31:43] mysterious city where nobody knows how
[31:45] they make their money. They're just a
[31:47] small little city within Rome.
[31:50] And they make their money based on
[31:54] you know uh investments, banking,
[31:58] investments in certain companies, oil
[32:00] companies and so on. And so they don't
[32:05] have expenditure like other countries
[32:08] and but they've got a lot of wealth
[32:11] which comes from you know uh well the
[32:15] pope has a fund that comes to him which
[32:18] is called Peter's pence which started
[32:21] many years ago where they take funding
[32:24] from all Catholics all over the world to
[32:28] give to the pope. The government of the
[32:30] Vatican city is called the Holy Sea. And
[32:34] if you have any dealings with the
[32:36] government of the Vatican, you are going
[32:38] to be dealing with the Holy Sea. So they
[32:42] control
[32:44] um all the financial situation of the
[32:47] Vatican. And so how things work is let's
[32:50] say the United States goes into this war
[32:54] now with Russia. The United States is
[32:57] already in trillions of dollars of debt
[33:00] um to the world banks and so how things
[33:03] work in the world is they call it buying
[33:07] debt. So
[33:09] if they go further into war and United
[33:13] States is the United States, the UK,
[33:15] Europe is going to suffer.
[33:18] Um, and because they're going to spend a
[33:21] lot of money, trillions of dollars to
[33:24] try and help the Ukraine. And all
[33:26] because it's not about morality, it's
[33:29] politics. It's all about oil. It's all
[33:31] about monopoly. It's all about um
[33:36] companies and rich men fighting for
[33:39] fighting to be the top dog, to control
[33:41] the oil, to control uh markets and to
[33:45] make I don't know why they're so
[33:46] passionate about just making more money
[33:49] than other people. So that's what it's
[33:51] all about.
[33:52] And so if they go into a terrible amount
[33:55] of debt where the United States cannot
[33:58] come back and build itself up, then it
[34:03] it will take another country to buy
[34:05] their debt, meaning
[34:08] to save them economically. But then that
[34:12] country will be beholden or will forever
[34:17] be uh controlled by this other country
[34:21] that bought their debt.
[34:23] So there's not many other countries that
[34:25] can bail the West out if they get
[34:30] crippled by nuclear war. And this is
[34:33] very likely what's going to happen. And
[34:37] so if you look at the rest of the world,
[34:40] the United States will never go to
[34:44] some countries in Africa or South
[34:46] America to to buy their debt. They'll
[34:48] never go to the Arabs. The last thing
[34:51] the United States wants is to be in debt
[34:54] to the Arabs,
[34:56] right? So there is Israel
[35:00] uh and there is the Vatican.
[35:03] And so more than likely, according to
[35:06] prophecy, what's going to happen is that
[35:08] should any of these countries go into
[35:10] debt, they are going to be bought by the
[35:13] Vatican.
[35:14] And that's going to start this the chain
[35:18] of events prophesied by scripture of the
[35:21] one world system. Now, it sounds like it
[35:24] sounds like um
[35:27] uh conspiracy theory, right? But so this
[35:31] what I'm showing you is on the outskirts
[35:34] of the book of revelation. This is kind
[35:38] of like when you look at it you see this
[35:40] global view. Right now in this book of
[35:43] revelation
[35:45] you have three major
[35:49] um bodies
[35:52] or figureheads that all the prophecies
[35:57] are about. It's all about redemption,
[36:01] right? And there are three. It's Israel,
[36:04] the church, and the bride. So, you find
[36:08] for Israel, you have prophecies
[36:10] surrounding Israel will be the seven
[36:12] trumpets of Revelations
[36:15] uh 8 and 9 and 11. And Revelation 7, the
[36:20] revelation of the 144,000.
[36:23] Uh for the church, you have the seven
[36:26] church ages. These are the prophecies
[36:28] now from the book of revelations. You
[36:29] have the first four seals and you have
[36:32] the seven vials. These are related to
[36:34] the church. And then for the bride you
[36:36] have the seventh seal, the seven
[36:38] thunders
[36:40] and uh and the rest you have the sixth
[36:43] seal which deals with these groups in
[36:45] the west and the east uh democracy,
[36:48] communism, the Vatican city and and of
[36:52] course the unpredictable middle east.
[36:56] Now what is amazing here right is that
[36:59] this is all about oil and it's right now
[37:03] the world is facing a shortage of oil
[37:06] right and communism becomes emboldened
[37:10] at the time when there is a shortage of
[37:12] oil
[37:14] and the reaction towards communism is
[37:18] what likely leads to world war II now
[37:22] let's look at that spiritually we have
[37:24] seen this happening spiritually from a
[37:27] long time ago and you just never
[37:28] realized it, right? What is the oil
[37:31] symbolizing? The Holy Ghost. What have
[37:34] we seen in the last 100 years? We've
[37:38] seen a shortage of the Holy Ghost. We
[37:40] had this surge of the Holy Ghost coming
[37:44] through as the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[37:46] in Isusa Street and it started that last
[37:49] Pentecostal age. And the Bible
[37:52] prophesies Matthew 25 that there will be
[37:56] at the time of the the coming of the
[37:57] Lord five wise virgins, five foolish
[38:01] virgins and the whole issue is oil.
[38:06] So spiritually what we were supposed to
[38:09] see is in the church a shortage of the
[38:12] Holy Ghost. Now immediately people who
[38:15] are Pentecostal will say well that means
[38:18] a shortage of tongues and
[38:20] interpretations prophecies and this and
[38:22] that and so on and of course you know
[38:25] that's um those are gifts of the Holy
[38:29] Ghost that is not the Holy Ghost right
[38:33] the Holy Ghost is the oil of anointing
[38:35] the oil of inspiration
[38:38] um that which brings the earnest of
[38:41] revelation to the to to the believer
[38:44] that would give him the ability to
[38:46] receive more revelation, right? And so
[38:51] that is the anointing and that would
[38:55] begin spiritual war because the shortage
[38:58] of oil, what is the shortage of oil
[39:01] going to start doing? It's going to
[39:02] force reaction just like you you see in
[39:05] the natural. You see the shortage of oil
[39:08] producing reaction and communism rising
[39:12] to balance out this effect and then the
[39:16] reaction from democratic uh societies
[39:20] to squash communism. So, so likewise in
[39:24] the church
[39:25] when you see uh the shortage of the Holy
[39:29] Ghost spiritually, you are going to find
[39:32] uh mentalities arising in the church
[39:35] with legalism to sort of balance out
[39:39] this lack of um baptism of the Holy
[39:43] Ghost. And then you'll find those pe
[39:46] there'll be some people claiming to have
[39:48] this massive amount of oil holy ghost
[39:51] like TB Joshua and uh Beni Hinn from the
[39:55] past and these people anointed
[39:57] ministries and people with signs and
[40:00] wonders and people will be flocking that
[40:02] way and then you'll just start to see
[40:04] this crash happening because these
[40:07] people who went into all these meetings
[40:09] with Beni Hinn and TB Joshua and all of
[40:13] them. They are healed from demon
[40:16] possession and healed from this and
[40:18] healed from that. And then you just see
[40:19] this crash because these same people who
[40:23] were delivered apparently
[40:26] then go on to lead horrible lives,
[40:29] fornicators, adulterers, fraudsters,
[40:33] money mongers. They bring a disgrace to
[40:37] the church. things start becoming
[40:39] uncovered like they happened with the
[40:41] with the the very sad life of um Ravi
[40:45] Zachcharias
[40:47] uh the the Christian apologist and many
[40:50] other people. It just it just never
[40:52] ends. And you would think that these
[40:54] people were were such anointed people
[40:57] and then you realize something else was
[40:59] going wrong. And so it will go on and
[41:04] you'd have all these Christian churches
[41:07] and there is a great shortage of oil.
[41:11] And at the time what's happened is that
[41:14] the bride church has the oil has seen
[41:18] the coming of the Lord and has moved
[41:20] into a different place. And you have the
[41:23] foolish virgin searching while the world
[41:26] is spiraling into chaos heading into
[41:30] midnight
[41:32] and they have no light and they're
[41:34] searching for oil. So that's where we
[41:38] are right now saints. And you see this
[41:41] situation that is happening in the
[41:43] natural in the world is has already been
[41:46] happening in the spiritual. And that's
[41:48] where you might be sitting in a church
[41:50] right now where things are dead, dreary.
[41:55] You don't know what's happening. You
[41:56] realize that
[41:59] uh something has gone wrong. And
[42:03] in your spirit, you feel
[42:06] things are not right. Things coming from
[42:09] the pulpit, the word is not being
[42:10] preached right. You might have been
[42:13] sitting in a church where uh you you're
[42:16] seeing gifts of the Holy Ghost, but
[42:17] something is telling you something in
[42:19] your spirit is telling you it's not
[42:20] being handled right. There's corruption
[42:22] in there. There's something wrong and uh
[42:26] you're feeling the urgency to move to
[42:29] find a better place to find a a
[42:31] different anointing to find a different
[42:34] church to find a different ministry.
[42:36] You know these are the kind of things
[42:38] people have been going through for years
[42:40] right now you know um now and many
[42:44] people are despondent many message
[42:47] believers
[42:48] are despondent many Christians are
[42:50] despondent realizing that there's this
[42:53] immense fakeness
[42:56] happening and they don't know what to do
[43:00] and so
[43:02] you know so what like I said I want to
[43:04] show you the value of the book of
[43:07] revelations. Now in the last few minutes
[43:10] of this session, I want to
[43:15] tell you what the book of revelations is
[43:19] and why it is so valuable to us and why
[43:22] for you young people
[43:25] it is so valuable and why it is the
[43:28] reality of what is going on right now.
[43:31] So what is the book of revelations?
[43:34] All right. So you, some of you bright
[43:37] sparks will go, well, you know, it's uh
[43:39] John's visions on the aisle of Patmas.
[43:42] Good for you. At least you know that.
[43:44] And uh it's the revelations of the
[43:46] future. Yes, good for you. You know
[43:48] that. It's tells us like what's
[43:50] happening with Russia and the West and
[43:52] the Vatican City and Israel and the
[43:56] rapture and the the prophet and the
[43:58] church ages. Yes, it tells us all of
[44:00] that. But here's the secret of it.
[44:04] The book of Revelations maps out an
[44:08] accurate prophecy of what will happen
[44:12] if Christ or the seed of Christ is
[44:16] planted
[44:19] anywhere in any situation of life. Did
[44:23] you hear me? That's what the book of
[44:25] Revelation is.
[44:27] In other words, it's like
[44:29] it's putting it crudely,
[44:33] it's telling you what would happen if
[44:36] the life of Christ, imagine if it was a
[44:39] seed and you planted that seed in the
[44:41] ground. The book of Revelation tells you
[44:44] exactly what is going to happen once
[44:47] that seed starts to germinate.
[44:50] Uh, in other words, it's predictable.
[44:54] It's something that that that God knows
[44:58] that will happen because it's his life.
[45:02] It's God's life that is being introduced
[45:04] into the world that is going to create
[45:07] this chain reaction of events.
[45:11] And basically, we've seen it being
[45:14] played out over 2,000 years.
[45:17] The seed of Christ was swn into the
[45:19] ground at Calvary
[45:21] and emerged by a resurrection and then
[45:24] went into 2,000 years of church ages or
[45:29] history of the Christian church.
[45:32] Now,
[45:34] for those of you who might not realize
[45:36] it, but the the the world at the time of
[45:40] Christ was in a very dark place. the
[45:43] Roman uh empire was ruling the earth.
[45:48] The majority of the earth at that time
[45:50] was a majority of the people of earth at
[45:52] that time were religious people, very
[45:55] superstitious people. There were no
[45:57] atheists at that time. In every
[46:00] continent, there were people that
[46:02] believed in God, gods, deities,
[46:07] people that worshiped the planets,
[46:09] creatures on Earth.
[46:11] They were all over the place. And they
[46:14] and then there were these Israelites who
[46:17] believed in this one true God. Islam had
[46:20] not arrived yet. Um so
[46:24] talk about Abrahamic religion. The only
[46:27] Abrahamic religion at the time was uh
[46:31] the Jews.
[46:32] And so the rest of the world were just
[46:36] uh polytheistic meaning they believed in
[46:39] many gods. And they were in a very dark
[46:42] place because they were sacrificing
[46:44] humans, uh, babies, virgins.
[46:49] They were spilling blood. They were
[46:52] fighting amongst each other, tribalism,
[46:55] wars, on and on, invading countries.
[47:00] And so, it's at that dark time that the
[47:05] seed of Christ is sown into the world.
[47:10] And it immediately causes a chain
[47:13] reaction.
[47:15] And so what we see is this seed begins
[47:19] to germinate. Meaning it through the
[47:22] disciples it starts to break from the
[47:25] ground and starts to infiltrate all
[47:29] other countries. And all these disciples
[47:32] do is they start to move and start
[47:34] telling people about Jesus Christ and
[47:36] that he died and he rose again and that
[47:38] there's freedom from the darkness of uh
[47:42] ignorance and the darkness of death and
[47:46] there's hope beyond the grave. And this
[47:48] spread through the world without social
[47:51] media, without internet, without uh
[47:55] anything but humans meeting other humans
[47:58] and passing on this knowledge. And in
[48:02] the first
[48:04] 500 years, it accelerated until it
[48:07] reached Rome.
[48:09] And Rome absorbed this religion as its
[48:12] own religion.
[48:14] And then it began to spread all across
[48:16] the earth. People built ships. People
[48:21] moved by wagons. People were so
[48:24] incentivized
[48:25] by this one man, Christ. And they went
[48:30] across the entire globe
[48:33] trying to convert other people
[48:36] who had never heard of him, who had
[48:38] never seen him. There were no books
[48:41] written. There were no audios.
[48:45] But they went around getting through to
[48:48] people, learning people's languages,
[48:50] teaching them about Christ. And what did
[48:53] it do? It formed crusades and it it
[48:57] upset world economies. It upset
[49:02] uh uh kingdoms. It overthrew empires.
[49:05] The French were fighting the British.
[49:07] The British were fighting the French.
[49:09] The French were fight They were all
[49:11] fighting for Jerusalem. the the Arabs
[49:13] then then came up and they begin to
[49:16] fight for Jerusalem and um and it just
[49:21] it didn't stop there. Then Jerusalem
[49:23] became the sacred place for all these
[49:26] people and then England uh you know
[49:30] wants to make uh uh Jerusalem be a part
[49:35] of their life. Their songs said they
[49:38] want to build Jerusalem in in England
[49:41] and because they saw the value of this
[49:45] and all this happened because of the
[49:48] inception or the germination of the seed
[49:53] of Christ. Now you young people in this
[49:56] day have to just pause for a second and
[49:59] understand what a great thing this is
[50:02] that has happened your world today that
[50:04] you have. You look around you and you
[50:06] look at the technology that you have and
[50:08] the internet you have and the uh
[50:11] knowledge and the
[50:14] uh university degrees that you have all
[50:19] occurred because of Christianity.
[50:23] And some of you will be thinking no come
[50:26] on really well of course because it was
[50:29] Christianity that liberated people from
[50:32] tribalism. It was Christianity that
[50:35] liberated all the pagans and heathens
[50:38] from the darkness of tribalism and
[50:42] ancestral worship.
[50:44] Christians built the universities.
[50:46] Christian built schools. Christians uh
[50:49] started educating people, teaching
[50:51] people to read and write and and
[50:54] introduced science and industrialization
[50:57] and all of those things. This these
[51:00] things happened and the the book of
[51:02] revelations prophesies
[51:05] or tells us from start to finish what
[51:10] will happen whenever the seed of Christ
[51:13] is accepted in a place. So
[51:18] what is the book of revelations? It is a
[51:21] symbolic
[51:23] description
[51:25] of exactly what will happen if the seed
[51:30] of Christ which is the word of Christ
[51:34] is planted in any situation. Okay. So in
[51:39] other words, this book of Revelation
[51:41] tells you what the religious reaction
[51:45] was going to be when the gospel of
[51:49] Christ hit the world. It tells you what
[51:52] the political reaction was going to be
[51:55] when the gospel of Christ hit the world.
[51:57] What demon or demonic reactions there
[52:01] was going to be. And you can compile all
[52:03] this into
[52:06] uh the prophecy of revelations tells you
[52:08] what the fallen human nature reaction
[52:13] was going to be once Christ was given to
[52:16] the world. It's that predictable. In
[52:18] other words, God is telling you what is
[52:22] going to happen once the seed of the
[52:25] word is taken in.
[52:27] Now, let's give you another example.
[52:30] Let's break it down and bring it closer
[52:32] to home. What happens when a church
[52:37] accepts the message which is the true
[52:40] seed of the word? What happens when or
[52:43] what happens when any group of people
[52:45] decide to become Christian?
[52:48] Well, basically that church is going to
[52:52] go through a revelations 1, a
[52:56] revelations 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, all the
[53:00] way through. And what is going to
[53:03] happen? You will see
[53:06] uh
[53:08] well, let's put it plainly, you will see
[53:11] a revival take place among people. Then
[53:15] you will see some people rise into a
[53:18] spiritual
[53:19] uh dominating place. You will find a
[53:24] spirit of religion rising to combat
[53:28] this. You will find men trying to use
[53:32] this uh as an opportunity to
[53:36] uh to manipulate others.
[53:39] You will find a political maneuver
[53:42] rising. You will find clicks and and and
[53:46] and um groups of people forming
[53:50] to find popularity. You will find others
[53:53] trying to make money out of it.
[53:55] Eventually this church will be led to a
[53:58] crash after which those who were there
[54:03] who were not supposed to be there will
[54:05] be pushed out and those who are the
[54:08] elect who will be few will remain and
[54:12] eventually it will end in a total
[54:15] downfall
[54:17] until only
[54:19] the original seed is left.
[54:24] That's the path. That's what and the
[54:26] book of revelations tells you how that
[54:28] will happen. Then there are judgments in
[54:31] this book of revelation which which
[54:33] actually shows you how the evil ones are
[54:37] going to be exposed.
[54:39] What judgments will come upon the false
[54:42] uh seed on those who are faking? What
[54:45] judgments will come upon those who are
[54:49] who are designed to bring
[54:52] spiritual death to the others? What will
[54:55] happen economically with them,
[54:56] financially with them,
[54:59] morally with them? All of that is
[55:02] contained in this book of revelation.
[55:04] All right?
[55:06] And that's just the church.
[55:08] If you take a family, what will happen?
[55:11] You take a family, let's say, that is, I
[55:15] don't know, maybe some
[55:18] from some denomination. Maybe they're
[55:19] Methodist, maybe they're Presbyterian,
[55:21] maybe they were Baptist, maybe they were
[55:23] Pentecostal. And this family comes into
[55:26] the message and they accept the seed
[55:29] word of God. They accept God sent a
[55:31] prophet. They accept Right. Now, what
[55:33] happens to that family? that family
[55:35] comes in, they have an explosion of
[55:39] um
[55:41] like a revival. Oh, this is amazing.
[55:43] This is beautiful. We're in heaven.
[55:46] We're, you know, uh the revival in their
[55:49] hearts. And but hold on a second because
[55:53] the book of Revelation is telling you
[55:55] this is normal. You've just hit your
[55:57] Patmas vision. You've just were in the
[56:00] spirit on the Lord's day and you heard a
[56:03] voice from heaven and voice sounding
[56:05] like a trumpet and you turn and you see
[56:07] the seven golden candlesticks. You're
[56:10] having a patmas vision experience. But
[56:13] then the spirit starts telling you, you
[56:16] know, there's going to be a church ages.
[56:19] There's going to be a Revelations 3 or
[56:21] Revelations 4, five or six. So what it's
[56:24] telling you is your family is going to
[56:25] start going through the motions of what
[56:28] happens when the seed of Christ is
[56:32] planted into the ground which is now
[56:34] your family. It's it's telling you what
[56:38] to what to expect. There's going to be
[56:42] a great high that you are going to go
[56:44] through a massive revival which is going
[56:47] to then
[56:49] uh move over to some heavy crisis. So
[56:55] those of you who experienced it will
[56:57] know the first thing that happen would
[56:59] be your your immediate family uh your
[57:02] family members.
[57:04] So let's say you're a husband, wife and
[57:06] three children.
[57:08] So your wife's family, your husband's
[57:10] the husband's family says, "Okay, so now
[57:14] you people have joined this cult."
[57:16] and uh you're dressing differently and
[57:20] you know you not watching television
[57:22] anymore, you're not listening to pop
[57:24] music anymore, you're not joining other
[57:26] churches, uh you're not doing Christmas,
[57:30] you're Easter, you're not doing Lent,
[57:32] you're not doing Ash Wednesday and I
[57:35] don't know what whatever it is that you
[57:37] used to do, you're just giving
[57:39] everything up because you've taken in
[57:42] the seed of Christ and now you're So
[57:45] what happens is you you go through this
[57:47] massive
[57:49] uh crash because you're so enjoying the
[57:53] fellowship with the sons of God and now
[57:56] your families, your close relatives
[57:58] start to push you away. They start to
[58:01] persecute you,
[58:03] cousins, aunts, uncles. Uh I tell you,
[58:06] it's just incredible how it naturally
[58:09] happens. They start calling you names.
[58:11] They start calling you cult. They start
[58:13] uh criticizing you. They they ostracize
[58:16] you. They then time goes on and then
[58:20] they start to realize, okay, these
[58:21] people are serious about it. We thought
[58:23] they were going to fail, but now looks
[58:24] like they're sticking to it. And then
[58:26] they start to get used to you. They
[58:28] start coming back. Some of them start to
[58:30] listen to what you have to say. Some of
[58:31] them start to believe what you have to
[58:33] say. And then it starts for them. The
[58:35] cycle starts for them. Then your family
[58:38] grows, your children grow,
[58:42] children go to school,
[58:44] they start to believe, they start to
[58:47] have problems. Um, church starts to have
[58:50] problems. And then you find you're
[58:54] starting to have issues with your
[58:55] marriage. You start to have issues with
[58:57] your kids. Some of them are backsliding.
[59:00] And you're still plotting on in this
[59:02] message. So news flash, the book of
[59:05] revelations tells you all this was going
[59:08] to happen. In other words, in your
[59:11] family, there's a communist segment,
[59:14] there's a democracy segment, there are
[59:17] prophecies for those segments, there's a
[59:19] Middle East segment, there's an issue
[59:21] about oil. There's always going to come
[59:23] to an issue about oil that's going to
[59:25] bring a third world war. There are going
[59:28] to be trumpets in your family. There's
[59:30] going to be judgments.
[59:32] the the book of Revelation maps it out
[59:34] for you. It's it's it's full of this
[59:36] wisdom, right?
[59:38] And that's the part that when you find
[59:42] that wisdom and you realize that the
[59:44] book of Revelation tells you what those
[59:46] spirits are, you you can know how to
[59:48] deal with them. You can know what the
[59:51] trumpets are for your life, for your
[59:53] family,
[59:55] uh and uh what it means uh and and where
[59:59] it's going to head. And and if you know
[1:00:01] what all the prophecies are, you're not
[1:00:03] going to be terribly downcast and you
[1:00:06] know, God, you've forsaken us and this
[1:00:07] and that. Basically, what I'm telling
[1:00:09] you is is if you accepted the message,
[1:00:12] if you took Christ in the book of
[1:00:14] Revelation tells you, it's called
[1:00:16] apocalypse. It's called revealing. The
[1:00:19] book of Revelation is called the book of
[1:00:21] revealing, right? It's is to tell you
[1:00:24] what's going to happen when Christ comes
[1:00:26] in. And the the entire prophecy
[1:00:29] surrounds the second coming of Christ.
[1:00:32] That means bad things are going to
[1:00:34] happen. Terrible things are going to
[1:00:36] happen around you. But there is going to
[1:00:38] be a second coming. There's going to be
[1:00:39] a moment where there's going to be one
[1:00:42] part of you that's going to receive the
[1:00:44] coming of the Lord. And it's going to be
[1:00:46] absolutely glorious. And there's going
[1:00:48] to be this celestial victory and this
[1:00:51] millennium that's going to happen.
[1:00:53] there's you're going to reach this place
[1:00:54] in in in your family's life where
[1:00:57] there's going to be peace, but then
[1:00:59] there must come this final war of Gog
[1:01:01] and Magog and this communist sector must
[1:01:04] come and crash down this this other evil
[1:01:08] part that was a part of your family and
[1:01:10] you must be cleansed and purged and and
[1:01:13] there's hope. There's going to be a new
[1:01:15] heaven and new earth. That means you
[1:01:17] keep pressing on with the seed of Christ
[1:01:20] and there will be a new heaven and new
[1:01:23] earth, a new order restored. Your family
[1:01:25] will go through this terrible situation.
[1:01:28] But on the other end, if it has accepted
[1:01:31] the seed of Christ, there is hope. There
[1:01:33] is restoration.
[1:01:36] uh as a person if you as a person
[1:01:41] lastly in closing you take this seed of
[1:01:45] Christ into your heart
[1:01:47] you know there's there's a quote brother
[1:01:48] Bam says in in in a question and answer
[1:01:51] he says if you thought you were in the
[1:01:53] war
[1:01:55] uh he said just get the baptism of the
[1:01:57] Holy Ghost he said then Satan's got
[1:02:00] every single gun trained on you become a
[1:02:03] target for the enemy so that in itself
[1:02:06] tells you uh exactly what I was trying
[1:02:09] to explain to you just now is that when
[1:02:12] you take in the seat of Christ when you
[1:02:14] truly believe now if you're just joining
[1:02:16] a church and you come to the message and
[1:02:18] you just there with your family and you
[1:02:21] know you're just going through the
[1:02:23] motions you haven't really believe the
[1:02:25] word of God in your heart well nothing's
[1:02:27] going to happen you you'll just go on
[1:02:29] just like everyone else in the world no
[1:02:31] issue uh you won't even feel you know
[1:02:34] sort of conviction And if you do things
[1:02:36] wrong, you're you're just there, a a
[1:02:39] regular church member. But the moment
[1:02:42] that the word starts to take effect in
[1:02:44] your life, this is what's going to
[1:02:47] happen. You're going to have this
[1:02:48] wonderful experience.
[1:02:50] You're going to have this pat vision
[1:02:52] experience.
[1:02:54] uh personally, you're going to be um
[1:02:58] bombarded with this beautiful
[1:03:00] revelations pouring in and God's going
[1:03:03] to be you're just going to be so
[1:03:05] enjoying this open book experience.
[1:03:07] You're going to be feeling like you're
[1:03:09] in seventh heaven. It's wonderful. It's
[1:03:11] beautiful. You know, it you don't even
[1:03:14] know that the open book has already
[1:03:16] started working on you, but you you just
[1:03:19] come to the message. Oh, you're just
[1:03:21] going to have this wonderful time
[1:03:23] singing, worshiping believers camps. You
[1:03:27] know, you're going to be going to youth
[1:03:29] camps. You're going to go to family
[1:03:31] camps. You're going to be enjoying
[1:03:33] brother so and so from America, someone
[1:03:35] from the from Europe, someone from
[1:03:37] Germany, somebody from the east. You're
[1:03:40] just enjoying conventions. And then the
[1:03:42] next thing split start happening. this
[1:03:45] pastor against this pastor that you know
[1:03:48] and you as a person you start to get
[1:03:50] disoriented you start to feel dejected
[1:03:53] what's happening and you start hearing
[1:03:56] bad news here this pastor's backsliden
[1:03:58] immorality here and this happening here
[1:04:01] and that happening there and sure enough
[1:04:06] personally you start going through uh
[1:04:09] problems you know you start realizing
[1:04:12] you probably hit your second seal third
[1:04:15] seal, you know, uh and these this book
[1:04:20] of revelation
[1:04:22] maps it out for you. And if you have the
[1:04:25] revelation of these little mysteries, it
[1:04:29] is the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:04:32] It is the accurate prophecy of what will
[1:04:36] happen if the seed of Christ is planted
[1:04:40] into any place. It tells you political
[1:04:44] reactions, religious reactions, demonic
[1:04:47] reactions, human reactions, heathen
[1:04:50] reactions, pagan reactions, Islamic
[1:04:53] reactions, communist reactions, fascist
[1:04:56] reactions. That's what this book is
[1:04:59] about. And if you as a person
[1:05:02] understand this that this is what's
[1:05:05] happening in your life, it's because of
[1:05:08] the presence of the word that is there.
[1:05:11] and you would be a wiser person to know
[1:05:14] what the book of revelation is trying to
[1:05:16] reveal to you. So in closing,
[1:05:21] I hope that gives you enough incentive
[1:05:23] to want to understand this book of
[1:05:26] revelation. And so I'm not going to try
[1:05:29] and, you know, go through massive
[1:05:32] teachings. Uh what I hope to do in this
[1:05:35] series is just to
[1:05:38] go through the verses and help you
[1:05:41] understand it. I realized that not many
[1:05:44] people it was a quite a uh crushing
[1:05:48] realization
[1:05:50] you know to me when my son asked me that
[1:05:52] question to
[1:05:54] realize that one of the reasons why we
[1:05:57] struggling with young people today is
[1:05:59] because they speak a completely
[1:06:01] different language. uh I mean we speak
[1:06:04] English but to them it's a different
[1:06:07] language and when they read the words of
[1:06:11] the prophecy of the book of revelations
[1:06:13] they are totally lost for many reasons
[1:06:17] either they are overcome with you know
[1:06:21] um
[1:06:24] all of these fantastical
[1:06:27] u creativity of Hollywood and the world
[1:06:31] around them. So that the book of
[1:06:34] Revelations tends to look like another
[1:06:36] kind of, you know, uh, science fiction
[1:06:40] drama.
[1:06:42] And, uh, to to others, it just looks
[1:06:44] like a whole lot of gibberish that
[1:06:47] they're never going to understand.
[1:06:49] Um, so what I want to do is to try and
[1:06:52] help you as we read it together. And I
[1:06:57] want to try to move through it quickly
[1:06:59] and not get into too much of quote
[1:07:01] reading and scriptures and you know uh
[1:07:04] just try to keep it as simple as
[1:07:06] possible so that you can understand
[1:07:08] phrase by phrase and that when you read
[1:07:11] you know just to sort of give you the
[1:07:13] guideline on how to approach each
[1:07:15] scripture and the correct interpretation
[1:07:18] of each scripture and because we know we
[1:07:21] have the Holy Spirit with us we'll be
[1:07:24] led into the truth by the Holy expert
[1:07:26] and we're looking forward to to that.
[1:07:29] So, the Lord bless you saints and I hope
[1:07:31] this will give you some inspiration
[1:07:34] going forward with the series. God bless
[1:07:37] you. Have a good evening and God bless
[1:07:40] you and be with you and your families.
[1:07:43] And I I trust that the word will be a
[1:07:45] blessing to you. Amen.
