TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So that's where we are right now. The dispensation of the bride. God is no more above us, invisible pillar of fire, pillar of cloud. God is no longer Jesus Christ from 2,000 years ago. GOD IS NO LONGER JUST HOLY GHOST, BAPTISM, ANOINTINGS, HEALINGS, MIRACLES, DISCERNMENTS, all those kind of things. GOD IS NO LONGER JUST THOSE THINGS. God is now becoming his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His people, WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN FROM THE BEGINNING of the story of God and man. He created man for this purpose. AND THIS IS THE TRIAL of people today because your sin, your mistakes, your problems. This is a reason why pastors and ministers can't accept this coming BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ACCEPT THAT GOD can be you. &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT THAT GOD CAN BE YOU? Number one is your definition of God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's your main problem. You don't understand the mystery of God. YOU THINK GOD IS JUST AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP TO WHOM others must bow down, sing, and pray to. That's the starting point. If you don't know what God is, you could never be him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why they they criticize us and TELL US LIKE, I DON'T KNOW. WHY ARE YOU IN THE MESSAGE THEN? WHY NOT JUST GO TO DENOMINATION? WHAT ARE YOU HEARING THE MESSAGE? BECAUSE THE MESSAGE TELLS US THIS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THIS VERY THING &gt;&gt; THAT THIS IS WHAT WE WERE CHOSEN FOR. &gt;&gt; LIKE I I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE PREACHING THE SEVENTH SEAL. WHY TALKING ABOUT IT AND USING BUZZWORDS? WHY READING THE SCRIPTURE? WHY TALKING ABOUT IT IF you don't believe it? JUST LET IT GO AND WALK AWAY. AMEN. This is the fullness of times. The fullness means the maximum. It means to come to complete maturity. It therefore refers to the age of adopted sons, manifested sons. THOSE WHO WERE BECOMING SONS ARE NOW become sons. And yes, this is this is the mediocre limp noodle arguments that I get. Oh, if you're a son, where's the power of spoken word? Why aren't you speaking things into existence? Well, I'm like, I wish I could SPEAK YOUR STUPIDITY OUT OF EXISTENCE. &gt;&gt; That's where I am right now. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT. WE'RE NOT HERE to go and make miracles because we know it's already been told us that in the Bible that that that that power that beast power coming out of the earth is GOING TO GO OFF and and deceive the whole world WITH MIRACLES AND CAUSE FIRE TO COME out from heaven. What what are we doing? Trying to fight back with that beast. This is the time where I mean why do you need to go and speak things into existence when you can't even deal with your own marriage &gt;&gt; or your children or your house or get some good accounting so you pay your bills &gt;&gt; and don't run short. You want to manage God's kingdom and speak things into existence. You can't even manage your own budget. THIS IS THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS IS IMMATURITY. What are we waiting for? OH, I CAN'T WAIT, BROTHER. WHEN I GET THE POWER OF GOD, I'M GOING TO SPEAK THINGS INTO EXISTENCE. YEAH. You think you got the solution for the world? I'm going to speak this out of existence. I'm going to solve the world's problems. It's like a grandiose narcissistic thinking like I need to solve everyone's problems so they look at us and see oh the bride. Oh the sons of God. Look at them how beautiful they are. They're our saviors. We love them. No. You saw what they did with Christ. &gt;&gt; He was all that. &gt;&gt; They hated him. They nashed their teeth at him. They spent night and day conspiring. How are we going to get him? How are we going to kill him? HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE THAT HE'S THIS? HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE THAT HE'S AN that he's a antichrist? That he's not the Messiah? Can you imagine such men obsessed? You know, like, man, just take a break. Go do some gardening. &gt;&gt; Go milk THE COWS. THEY'RE SO OBSESSED LIKE THEY ARE TODAY frothing at the mouth, you know, like like foot and mouth disease or something. THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE. IT'S LIKE LET'S GO HAVE COFFEE AND DISCUSS HOW WE CAN TAKE THEM DOWN. &gt;&gt; It's really maniacal. I don't know. To me, I all these anti- message people. I don't even know what's the big deal. Why don't just leave us alone? We don't even make a dent in the world. We're not even like a billion people. We're not even like millions of people. Nobody listens to us. Nobody takes us seriously anymore. And when they see us, they, oh, you're that group. Okay, nice to see you. Bye. Now, nobody wants to listen to us. We are totally rejected. WE'RE NOT EVEN TRYING TO GET INTO your homes. We're not even trying to live rentree in your heads. What's going on? Why not just let us be? You know, let us be. Let us go away and fade away in our madness like you say. No, they got to go on the internet and blast us and lambaste us and shame us and go take down our churches and call us cults and we're not even doing anything. We're not even fighting back. It's like every time you beat us, we're just And then you beat us again. I don't understand. Actually, I do. When something convicts you and you know it's right and you know it's nagging at you, you can't let it go. &gt;&gt; You have to find a way to prove it wrong for yourself. &gt;&gt; That's the problem. &gt;&gt; We're not pushing it at you. I mean, this this humble man made so many mistakes, grammatical errors. He said some things here this way, another thing here that way and this that way. this prophecy was spoken in this fashion here and later on he spoke it in this way slightly different to that. I mean you could go you get so exhausted. I'm telling you sitting with them and talking this out and being an apologist is just the wrong thing to don't even get into that. There's there's absolutely no reason. In fact, if anyone comes up to you and they anti- William Brandon, just say yes, I agree with you. Walk away. Yes, you're right. Wow. and walk away. SHAKE HANDS. GOD BLESS YOU, MAN. You're the greatest. Walk away. That's all. Just take the whole poke the balloon and take all the air out because you're not going to get anywhere. THEY ARE TRYING TO FIGHT back to prove it to themselves to make them feel good about the lives they're living because that word is convicting them. &gt;&gt; It's killing them. That's just what that's the truth. You young people, anyone when you come to me and question me on the message and the prophet and start to tell me it's false, believe me, I know what's happening in your head. It's convicting you. You want to do stuff, but you feel like the message is preventing you from doing that's all. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is how this is how humans work. &gt;&gt; If they want to do something, you really want to do it, go do it. Go do it. Go see what happens after that. then come back. We'll still be here except you'll just come back a little bit dented and cut and bruised and not the same as you you would be if you didn't go there. See that? That's what I'm saying. But when you come to me and start attacking a man of God who dedicated his life to the word, who had manifestations of the word of God in his life, of the pillar of fire, of a whole lot of other things, and maybe he spoke in some weird way that doesn't make sense to you and said inconsistent things, but you're fighting back against it because it's inconvenient to you. Then just be honest. say, "I don't I want to do stuff, you know, brother Al. I want to go out and enjoy my life and, you know, I want to get a couple of girlfriends and see how that works out. Go, man. GO HAVE FUN. GO FIND YOURSELF. We'll still be here." I can't tell you how many times it has happened. You know, you get some some young man and tell me, "Oh, brother Al, I crossed the line." Really? You crossed the line or you want to? You want me to tell you it's okay. You should not be in our church anymore. You want it to be my fault that you leave. Just be a man. Get a spine man. Leave. Say, "I'm I'm making this DECISION FOR MYSELF. I'M GOING. I want to figure it out. I be honest. I'll respect you. But don't come here and make me chase you out so that you can say they chase me out. No, we need men. We need real men and women today who can can have a real spine and take responsibility for their actions. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; So the fullness of time means the maximum of times the maturity of times. What does this mean? THIS MEANS THAT ALL THIS is the dispensation. This dispensation where all the covenants that have not been fulfilled. This is not the dispensation of the fullness of time. This is the dispensation of the fullness of times. &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, it's the fullness of the time of Noah, the fullness of the time of Abraham, the fullness of the time of Moses, the fullness of In other words, it's coming to its maximum. All the covenants that were not realized are going to be realized. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, the first coming of Christ, THE CHURCH, ALL MANIFESTATIONS there in the past, ALL THE COVENANTS ARE BEING fulfilled now. This is the fullness of times plural. Amen. Are you are you with me, saints? &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:10 did not say the fullness of time. It said the fullness of times plural. Let's read. Who is this MelkiseDC? All right, buckle your seat belts. This one just puts it all together for us. Notice like the sculpture, he hides with a mask over it. That's what God has done to this age. It's been hid. It's supposed to be revealed in this age. Now, the Bible says they will be revealed in the latter times. It's like a sculptor keeping his piece of work all covered until the time he takes the mask off. And there it is. &gt;&gt; You with us? &gt;&gt; And that's what the Bible has been. It's been a work of God that's been covered up. It's been hid since the foundation of the world. And it's sevenfold mystery. AND GOD PROMISED IN THIS day at the age of this Leodysian age, he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. What a glorious thing. God and Morphe masked in the pillar of fire. Where are we? Oh, you you changed it. Are we together? Paragraph 43. God and Morphe mosque in the pillar of fire. Got it. &gt;&gt; God and Morphe in a man called Jesus. God and Morphe masked. &gt;&gt; Masked in a man called Jesus. God in Morphe in his church. And there it is. God above us, God with us, God in us, the condescending God. Condescending does not mean he looks down on you. Like the modern, this is the prophet's meaning of condescending means losing a previous state to take on a lower one. To take on a lower one. &gt;&gt; That's what he means by that. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; So we go back to Ephesians 1:10 which says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ. All right. So did you see? Now I want you to do this when you go back home. Some of you students of the scripture uh and the message. Go back and look at this previous one which is God above us, God with us, God in us. Go and type it into your table or whatever word word searches you have and search for that God above us, God with us, God in us. You will come up with a treasure trove of the same statement with so much more revelation in it. I don't have the time to do it. Maybe one of you can pick it up and preach that those three vers those three phrases, but go have a look at it. So that's why I'm telling you everything I told you is from the message. God above, God with us, God in us. You I think there's one quote where it even speaks about God in us becoming manifested sons. &gt;&gt; I I I think it's there. So go have a look at it. All right. So let's go to fullness of times. Gather together in one all things in Christ. So number one, gather together in one all things in Christ. Now let's go through this quickly. What is gather together? Easy, right? Unite. bring it all together. Gathering. Okay. He's not uniting all things uh uh like uniting all things in Christ. The So the question is what is in Christ? Right? So when we say uniting, most people think of, you know, we're all agreeing, right? That that's like something that never happens. You can never get people all gathered together and agreeing, but you can gather together, right? So, let's bring it all in. What is Christ? Christ is the manifested word, &gt;&gt; the word made flesh. So, what is God doing? He's gathering everything together in the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ means Messiah. The Messiah is the word manifested. So what was the word? The word was the logos who WAS HAD ALL THE ATTRIBUTES IN HIM, RIGHT? THE ATTRIBUTES OF HIMSELF. SO GOD IS GATHERING all the attributes of himself that were in the logos. He's gathering it together in Christ. That means in the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Sons of God that shouted for joy as attribute form are now coming together in flesh form. They are being gathered together. Not all coming to one place. No one's running to Jeffersonville. No one's running to No. Gathering together means bringing them around the revealed word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, we can literally be miles apart, but we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it also means all the attributes to one new revelation of himself. And you can see that Revelations 5, when the lamb took the book, they sang a new song. Is that right? A new song, a new worship, a worship beyond the New Testament. This is the lamb taking the book. A new song is going to be sung because the the book is going to be brought down by the lamb. The seals have been broken off. The Bible becomes a new book. The mosque is pulled off. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And that happens right there in that Leodysian church age. When that seventh seal is being broke, the mighty angel descends, the seventh seal is open, the book comes down, the mosque is pulled off, seven seals are broken, the book is revealed. Amen. So that one revelation is not by a certain doctrine but by his personal visitation to each believer. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Why are we together in Christ? How is everyone going to get that one revelation? He has to come to each person. Yes. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be one brother preaching a certain way or one revelation being preached or series being taught by some person. No, he's going to do this through multiple men in the ministry of Christ. And he's going to visit each individual under all those ministries. There'll be others under those same ministries that will not get it. God will visit each individual who is a part of that and they will be brought together under that one revelation. &gt;&gt; All right, let's look at this highlight the next part of it. Now we go to things which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him. So notice he doesn't say things under the earth on earth, right? He's not bringing those uh under the earth is a phrase meaning the fifth dimension. &gt;&gt; Okay. So we we're not bringing things in that's in the fifth dimension. Things on earth and things which are in heaven. Nothing anymore of Christ in the dimension that was once called under the earth. There is nothing. &gt;&gt; Right? In other words, there's no more bosom of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Got it. There's no paradise in the fifth dimension. There's nothing there anymore. It's all been emptied out. Right? So attributes that were in the what what what are we talking about? The closing of the story of God and man, right? All the attributes from the beginning through this dispensation have been sown over time. Now we come to the dispensation, the fullness of times where all things MUST COME TOGETHER. ALL they without us cannot be made perfect. &gt;&gt; We are now the closing stage. Right? So the attributes that were in the word before the foundation of the world have been expressed on earth. Some were taken up to heaven which are the heavenly attributes still there as well as the attributes of him the bridegroom himself. Then there are attributes of the word who are in living vessels on earth right now. So that which is in heaven during this dispensation that comes to earth by the opening of the seventh seal with the attributes of the bridegroom, those attributes of the saints of old, those who died before us. They are basically the word that was manifested in the past. Some of them were foreshadows of Christ. Some of them came after Christ and have died. HE'S BRINGING THEM ALL together in one by the opening of the seventh seal by the mighty angel descending in him. It ends with in him which is in the logos that began it all. He was heaven. He became earth. They are now attributes in heaven who have lived through the times and been called on by him. God has taken them home. But in the dispensation of the fullness of times there will there will uh the last attributes on earth for the completion of all things in Christ. That's where we are right now. Gathering all things together in him means bringing all the attributes in the revealed word for that dispensation. It is a new ruling system of governance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is new governance. &gt;&gt; Amen. The government shall be upon his shoulder. He is good about the paps. No longer about the loins. &gt;&gt; He's now good about the paps. He's the judge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There's a new system of government. And when we say that, do you realize we are no longer the church? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I no longer call you church. I call you bride. So you understand what what's different about the church? We are not just the called out ones anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not just people who are keeping traditions of Christianity and and keeping of footwashing and communion and keeping of of ordinances of baptisms and and all kinds of traditions and things. We're not just about that. There's new ordinance. There's new governance because you are being brought into equality with him. You are not in the place of intercession for ignorance anymore. Big difference. Okay, let's bring this to a conclusion.
