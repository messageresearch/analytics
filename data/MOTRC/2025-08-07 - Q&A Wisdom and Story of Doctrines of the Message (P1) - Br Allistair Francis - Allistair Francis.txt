TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Uh so Matthew 15 verse1-14 then came Jesus to scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread? But he answered and said unto them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? For God commanded, saying, "Honor thy father and mother, and he that cursth father or mother, let him die the death." But you say, "Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, it is a gift. by whatsoever thou minest be profited by me and honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition. Notice he only gives one example of a commandment that was made of none effect. Verse seven, you hypocrites. Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying, "This people draw nigh or close unto me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. Uh, and he called the multitude and said unto them, and understand, not that which goeth into the mouth defileth man, but that which cometh out of the mouth? This defileth a man? &gt;&gt; Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended after they heard the saying? Right? But he answered and said, uh, every plant which my heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up. Let them alone. They be blind leaders of the blind, and the blind lead the blind. Both shall fall into the ditch. The Lord bless the reading of his word. You may be seated. We can keep that scripture up for a little bit. So once again, greetings in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And uh certainly good to be with you this morning. Like we said, we have uh so many people ill and uh not here this morning, but uh good to see those of you who could make it. And we trust that the word will be a blessing to you. And uh so I want to let's go to the title page. I want this is going to be question and answers 2025. and a long longish title, the wisdom and story of diverse doctrines of the message at the coming of Christ. So just to give you the introduction to this, I've received a question on the doctrines of the message and I've been asked this question. So, I I've been doing a lot of answering of questions in the past few uh uh weeks, but so this is something that's been on my heart for a long time. I just did never got the chance or the opportunity to do this, but I'm trusting that the Lord will will open up our hearts to be able to understand us properly. And I want to do this particularly for this new generation and also the older generation also um the young people coming up because uh as most of you would remember the prophet spoke about the third and fourth generation. If you remember, he says how the word comes in like the people came out of Egypt and they had Moses who was this uh this great prophet and uh this movement took place where this prophet begin to take these people with him towards the promised land and on the way you you you I mean you've got this great prophet right you see these plagues that strike Egypt and uh then he takes him through through the wilderness The moment difficult times come against them, they begin to faint and that means like uh fall uh their faith begins to to diminish and uh factions uh groups start to form within them. They move towards the promised land and you have Kora, Day and Abram. Then comes the ministry of Balum and then they get mixed up with the Moabites and and all this occurs and then when it comes time to be the opening of the seven seal to cross over Jordan and take the land that was promised by the ministry of the prophet then they don't want to cross over. &gt;&gt; Then they spent 40 years walking in this wilderness just because they didn't want to cross over. And uh if you translate all that to this day, it's like basically they're afraid to cross over uh they feel it's not the time or and and when it is the time, Joshua has to try and convince them to get over. And then the prophet even sends spies over and and says, "Go and check the land. Go and see it for yourself." And they come back and say, "Well, everything you said is true. It's beautiful. It's there." But they still don't want to break through. In other words, it's like fighting. the seventh seal is not open and a prophet is even saying it's open and you went there and you spied and you read and you looked at it, you have evidence of it and you still don't want to go over. &gt;&gt; So we see this in the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we see what's happened in our day. I just want to tell you it's a fantastic story. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so I'm going to say a lot of things this morning and I want I want to let you know that if some of you have come from these doctrines, don't be hurt by what I'm saying. It's simply the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. And some of it can be hurtful. Some of it can bring remembrance or remembrance of uh scars or something that you might have been through or places that you you sat in and uh you felt things and you experienced things. Some of it will bring it back. Some of it may have been uh your parents were were part of some of these doctrines. Um we're getting quite a bit of feedback. if somebody could just sort this out because this buzzing is going off on. So if you just can I also want to just um say to those online in the Newcastle assembly uh we're being we're constantly having troubles here with the with the network and bandwidth. We're having issues with uh so the network we're using is Vodiccom in this place and for some reason on different days the network is okay and sometimes it's it's not. So um just bear with us. We do our best to try and bring it back. If it cuts it cuts there's nothing we can do about it except to try and bring it back. So just bear with us. if at some time we we have our own place where we have a nice fiber hardline through and you know you get uninterrupted Wi-Fi networks but for now this is our situation we don't have a permanent place of our own and we're we're um uh we're subject to these LTE networks so just bear with us all right so coming back to our thought just to to let you know I'm not going to be I'm not somebody who is standing here in 2025 looking back and criticizing what has happened in the past. That's never been my position. And you here in this church know me and I've always taught you to respect people. Respect your your elders and ministers who brought us this message. I hold that dear to my heart. So that's not what we're doing. But the prophet said coming back to it, he said when this group goes over into the promised land, the first generation is dead. The second generation is is there's remnants of it. Said then the third generation, the light begins to diminish. And then comes a fourth generation that has completely no knowledge of what happened. They don't even know about the struggles of the wilderness. They don't know the struggles of crossing over into Jordan. crossing over the Jordan into the promised land. They don't know the struggles that even happened. They're just born in the message. &gt;&gt; They appreciate nothing and they come to a point where they just point back at the elders and say they were all wrong. This one was wrong. That one was wrong. They never went through the experience. They do not appreciate the way. They don't even appreciate how they got to this land that they actually own this place. They don't appreciate anything. They don't know the histories. And eventually they just say, "Well, what's the problem?" You know, we can we can make leagues with uh with the Amalachites. We can make leagues with the uh Jeepites, with the Hivites, we can we can just do whatever we want to. And uh that was against the word. The word was do not make leagues with them. Do not mix with them. Do not do all of these things, right? And so it the word even tells you there arose a generation that did not even know Moses. &gt;&gt; And that's where we are today. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, a whole lot of young people in the message who do not even have any patriotic feeling to the prophet. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; To the point of if you read things online, it's so easy for yourself just to cut yourself off and say, "I'm not interested in this." &gt;&gt; You know, I got no standing here. But you don't even realize why you are actually here. And that there are people who sweated blood and tears &gt;&gt; to get you to where you are. And there's there's some of you who sit back and say, "Well, my life was an absolute misery." Not even considering what your life could have been without this. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So to me, that's what's important with knowing the story &gt;&gt; and understanding the development. Amen. That being said, when we you read the scripture, if we go back to the scripture uh that we read in the beginning from verse 1 through to 5, you're seeing the Lord Jesus and and it's actually identifying two different doctrinal groups here, scribes and Pharisees. Scribes were not really a doctrinal group. They were more an educated group. They were the only people in the world at the time who could read and write. Nobody else could. Right? So even those people that say you know Matthew wrote the book of Matthew or Luke wrote this one or that Mark wrote that one probably Mark was the only one who was a servant to a scribe who could write read and write. The others dictated and a scribe would write for them. So they were very educated people right the scribes. But then the Pharisees were an actual sect, right? An actual put it this way, denomination, religious group or doctrinal uh or a church with a doctrinal difference at the time of the first coming. So we are going to be dealing with the story and the wisdom of the doctrines at the second coming. Right? So, but the way to understand and look and approach this is look at the first coming. So, here in the first five verses, Christ is showing that doctrines are formed because of men's traditions. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. So, they can claim all they want to that they got an epiphany or a pillar of fire appeared to them or a dream came to them. Doctrines are formed because of men's traditions. &gt;&gt; Yes. and you by your traditions make the word of none effect. That's in verse six. In verse 8, it says this this leads this this doctrines and these tradition leads to worshiping God by works. You see that and humanism but without the spirit of truth. This people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honor me with their lips. That means it it comes out as lip service &gt;&gt; uh works &gt;&gt; and they get satisfied serving me that this this way but their heart is far from me which means they actually don't even have the spirit or the love of it within them. &gt;&gt; This is Christ telling us this in the first comment right verse 9 says their worship is vanity they actually worshiping me in vain. Two things can you can take from there. Vain means it's not even reaching me. The worship is not even worth the while. I'm not even responding to it. And also vanity means they're doing it for their own convenience. Their worship is convenient to them. What does that mean? That'll tell you that almost every doctrine or camp that is formed is formed to make the faith convenient to the people to a certain group of people. This is why it starts from cultures traditions. Right? This is so I could do this and I was amazed that brother brother Claude was actually praying about this this morning. uh even your race finds certain things convenient to you. Your race, your culture, your tribe, where you come from, all of those things. Here in Africa, you can see it in America, you can see it in China, you can see anywhere you want to. But you'll naturally flock to what your culture subscribes to. Even if there's no truth there, just because it's your culture, you'll get stuck in it. because it's convenient. And verse 13 tells us, you know, the well the disciples, you can see verse 12 said they came to Christ and said, "Do you not know that the Pharisees were offended with what you said?" &gt;&gt; Well, of course he knew. He said it so he could offend them. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and not offend as in, "Oh, my feelings are hurt." Offend as in put a stumbling block in their way to make them think. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In the Bible, offend doesn't mean to hurt one's feelings. &gt;&gt; It means to stumble you up, &gt;&gt; right? Offense, a rock of offense is a stumbling stone. &gt;&gt; All right? So, don't read it from 2025's interpretation. And then verse 13, he says, he's basically telling them not to worry. These doctrines that come up, they were not planted by God. And if they're not planted by God, they're going to be rooted up anyway. So, don't worry about that. And and this is the important thing. verse 14. If you interpret that correctly, he's telling you don't fight them. &gt;&gt; Don't try to prove your point. &gt;&gt; Just let it continue. Do not feel like you have to go around correcting one another, &gt;&gt; correcting doctrines. Don't do that. &gt;&gt; He says they're basically blind leading the blind and all fall. That's where it heads up. All right. So this is a very good foundation to have when you approach doctrines. Are you with us? &gt;&gt; All right. So let's go to the question and read the question. This is a pretty long question sent to me by a believer. And um so I just want to say to you um some people may ask me, you know, brother Alistister, why are you doing question and answer? What do you think you are? Do you think you're Nobody said this. I'm just right. Do you think you're someone who can answer all the questions for the bride? Uh, no. But I ask I get asked questions and I've got to answer them, right? If somebody asks you a question, you have to answer. Um, the other thing is I just want to let you know for those of you who ask questions, uh, when I get a question, there are personal things. I go through the question and I look for things that might identify who you are. If you ask me a question, I remove that. So, but what I stick to is where the question is on the word and I kind of remove if you write a name there. I I I pull out names or something like that. I do my best to sift through it. So, if you're even speaking about a place where you come from or a church that you're at or whatever, I I extract it because we're not interested in that. We're interested in the word part of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, uh always remember if you send me a question, I'm never going to put your name up on the screen or something. And the other thing I do is I let the person know that I will be doing the question. So you're not going to get surprised and say, "Oh, Ash, put my question up. I didn't want this to go public." I will always ask you first whether I can do this question publicly. All right. So here's the question. The deeper I delve into the message digging and mining for gold, I love that &gt;&gt; because that shows me you're searching, right? the more I come across various message doctrines or message movements I don't know what to do with them when I bring up certain quotes in other words the person is saying they're looking for they're are happy in the message they're excited they're discussing things with people and then this idea of doctrine starts come up and when I bring up certain quotes of brother Bham some of the brotherhood suspects and thinks that I am from the thunders movement or the perua movement etc so clearly Clearly, this person has experienced this. This brother has experienced this. He's sharing what he knows with people and they're asking him, "Are you from the Thunderous movement? Are you from the Peruia movement?" And the brother has no idea. I know it. He's got no idea. He's never heard. He's never been through like some of you. He doesn't know the history. &gt;&gt; He doesn't even know how he got here. He doesn't even know what Perua is. I started so he says I started doing some research on these things because I heard about the thunders but no one has explained to me what this doctrine was all about. In other words, he heard about the thunders movement. &gt;&gt; He knows what the thunders are but he doesn't know what the thunders movement from the history is. And now when he talks about it they're asking him if he's from there. Moreover, when I started asking the brotherhood about what the thunder's movement and perua movement meant or what the millennials movement meant, some of you have not heard that one. No one is able to explain it to me or the explanations were contradictory. Generally, there's a palpable fear and suspicion surrounding these kind of questions. I've noticed that there are varying beliefs in the message regarding the millennium. Recently a brother said he was already spiritually in his millennium which caused a stir many questions and some ridicule. This was the first time I heard of the term millennials. When I started to investigate I also saw the perushia movement and seven thunders movement and the brideging movement. As I mentioned earlier when I started asking I noticed that although people talk about these factions they re don't really know what they are and what their doctrine is. &gt;&gt; So from that you can gather that some people are saying it's wrong without even knowing what it is. &gt;&gt; Why would they say that? Cuz they've been told it. &gt;&gt; They've been told don't trust the thunders. Don't trust the perua. Don't trust the bride. What is it? Bride coming movement. don't trust it because it's wrong, it's false. So that's all people just like people walk around and say, you know, that place Durban uh by the beachfront, don't go near there. There's a monster in the ocean. So they'll go for years believing there's a monster in the ocean. Don't go nearby. That's exactly what it is, right? Don't trust it. It's false. It's a false doctrine. Don't believe it. Don't talk to anybody. That's what's been happening. And um I also heard that brother there was a name there. I pulled the name out. Press play and obey group. And the second set of seals while reading the study on Bugua by another name. Brother I see a lot of confusion and I don't want to be a part of it. So I'm asking about these things because I think it's important to know what you believe in and why. So the question is trying to tell us when I read through and and and try to discern what's in there. It's like okay here's what these people say about these movements. So who are we now? In other words there's an identification of of all those who are false. What is our identification? Okay very important question. So my question brother he says what are these movements he lists them millennials to us millennials are something else right millennials perua thunders press play and obey brides come [Music] right right some of you are so exasperated you can you it's like you can't believe that that this question can be asked in this Hey, &gt;&gt; some of you sitting here do not even realize I'm looking at your children's faces and they want to know &gt;&gt; because they're also like what is this? We don't know what's going on or either you haven't talked to them about it or you feel it's not even safe to even bring it up. But be sure when your kids become adults, they are going to hear this &gt;&gt; and then they're going to come and ask you and and and hopefully your brain is still intact by then to have memory that you can tell them. Right? &gt;&gt; So I'm not going to wait that long. I'm doing it for them now. So the next part of the question is what are their characteristics? In other words, I the brother is giving me guidance now on how to answer this, right? What are their characteristics? What do they believe? How does it relate to the truth we know and hope? Many of these movements base their beliefs on quotes from brother Baron and the message of the hour. I see definitely this brother has encountered them because when you meet with someone who comes from a doctrine, they just show you the quotes they've been given. It's pretty much like Jehovah's Witness. pull out track after track, quote after quote. This is and you can even ask them, "Brother, have you read the whole book?" Well, no, the quote, they've been pointed to quotes, but they haven't read the whole book. This is how indoctrination occurs. I'm beginning to see that these are interpretations of what brother Baram said and that they are human inventions. It's good to know what we believe and where we stand and how it relates to all these movements. Brother, I know you're very busy and don't have much time, but I think this is an important topic and can help many brothers and sisters understand what they believe and why. Obviously, I believe that to strengthen our faith and prepare us in case we encounter someone from the above movements and recognize who we're dealing with. So, this is important. Like, if I give you all the information, what are you going to do? Are you really going to use this to argue with them? Like if you encounter someone, what's the right approach? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What are we supposed to do? What are we required of God? Are we supposed to stand toe-to-toe, fight with them, prove them wrong, put them in their place? What is the right uh uh thing to do? Right? And uh then we we can have a fruitful discussion, retrain and train our faith in love and lead to an interesting discussion that will yield many positive results. I like that. Exercise your faith. I like that. This may also sound a bit chaotic, but lately I've been thinking about it. I've noticed a lot of new things. There seems to be some taboo topics in the message of this hour that no one wants to touch. And this is probably due to fear uh due to our ignorance. That's very nicely put. Almost everything is out of fear. That's why they don't want to touch it. Okay. So, thank you brother. So before I embark on telling you the story of the message, I want to take the type of what happened in the first coming. And so let us look at the religious factions of Jews that were present at the first coming of Christ. Now this is a lot of you read your Bibles and and you haven't read the histories and you don't know what was happening at the time when Jesus arrived. Did you think all the church when when Jesus arrived was united? Do you think each suburb in Jerusalem or Nazareth or Bethlehem or around Israel, they were all united? Did you think all the Jews at that time enjoyed church? Do you think uh um um the the churches were were all so put together that they all agreed and they all were so happy? I mean, they literally have one law of Moses. They have one God. You know what what's the big deal, right? So I want to show you at the first coming of Christ the religious factions of Jews in the first coming. So here they are. Number one, the Pharisees. Number two, the Sadducees. Number three, the Essenes. Number four, the Zealots. Number five, the diaspora. I'm going to explain all these things to you. Number six, non-religious ruling class. And number seven, mixed working class. And you say, "But some of them sound like political." They're political and yet religious because every single group did not mix with the other and did not congregate together and spoke against the other, right? And these people, you're looking at at least seven different types were all present at the time of the Messiah, &gt;&gt; the first coming of Christ. And all the issues and questions and things that he had were from the different groups, right? And so also now we're talking about the actual Messiah coming. Each one of those groups had a different idea of how he was going to come, &gt;&gt; right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Each one of those groups when they saw him interpreted him differently. &gt;&gt; How? Based on their background, their culture, their leaning. Now I'm saying to you, you know, you got people today who claim, well, we must not believe anything anyone says. As long as Jesus in his corporal body is is is not standing in front of me, I will not accept what anyone says. As long as I don't see the purifier or I don't see this or I don't listen we had the first coming the literal physical corporal body of the Messiah standing there and only 11 accepted it. &gt;&gt; He didn't even have a church bigger than ours. &gt;&gt; Say well he had 70 people. He had 70 and then they left him once he started preaching his third bull ministry. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then in the end there were only 120 in the upper room. &gt;&gt; So I always try to bring people back to this reality because people think we're going to have a great sweeping revival through the earth and draw in thousands. What I'm saying to you is look at the reality. &gt;&gt; You've got Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; God made flesh. The word come down and made flesh among us. And every last one of them rejected him. &gt;&gt; Yes. So don't tell me that unless you see such and such a thing. What I'm saying to you is even if you had Jesus Christ himself standing here in the flesh today, you are going to interpret him based on what you know &gt;&gt; where you come from, what scriptures, some of you, I'll tell you, you'll even question Jesus Christ based on quotes from the message. Some of you will prove him wrong &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham didn't say so. And and most likely you you're quoting something from brother Brandham to Jesus Christ based on what your pastor told you. How do I know? Well, it was done there in the first coming. So to me, it's amazing that we've got people in this message today with the confidence thinking that when Jesus comes in the flesh, they'll know him and they'll accept him. &gt;&gt; When that failed in the first coming and you know, I try to be as real as I can. And I I when I talk to the young people, I say to them, if Jesus came in his literal body flying around in the clouds, the first people will know is CNN and BBC. There'll be helicopters and cameras. It'll be news networks all over the world videoing him. And the news would be it's a hologram. It's not real. Somebody's doing something. And most messaged people run towards conspiracies. Oh, some this is Russia. This is China. This is somebody producing something in the sky. This is what's amazing to me. Message believers think they'll see Jesus and all believe straight away. No, you'll all believe CNN first. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Or BBC. And then what's he going to do? Because now you have to go to the quote where he'll never put his foot on earth. Of course, he's lying. &gt;&gt; So he's not putting his foot on earth. So now, how are you going to question him when he's flying? &gt;&gt; I know what you're going to say. Well, the power will rise up within us and we'll fly to meet him. Listen, the way humans work is you'll disbelieve first. You'll actually believe CNN and BBC and all the news networks and the social media. You'll believe it's a prank. And if you see it, how how the world is doing things right now, you'll never believe it's true. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You'll rather believe aliens exist. All right, with that, let's go to it. I want to look at the Pharisees first. Okay, so the Pharisees, I'm going to tell you what they believed, right? They were strict adherence to the entirety of the Old Testament. That means these Pharisees were legalists who said the Old Testament is our law. We stick with that. This is why they brought scripture to Jesus to question him. They were taking him back to the word. They imagine the Messiah standing in front of them, but they need scriptures to question the Messiah. Think of the reality of that and think of whether you think you're confident enough to find the truth with your knowledge on the message that should the truth present itself, you'll just openheartedly accept it and not question it. Okay? The Pharisees concerned themselves with making a clear distinction between Jews and Gentiles. In other words, the Pharisees did not believe Gentiles were going to be saved. Jews must be here. Gentiles must be there. We are the elite people. These are lost. Very much like a camp, right? They use the law of Moses to subject people to laws that could clearly indicate a public social difference between Jews and Gentiles. In other words, they used the word of Moses to separate themselves. They did it in their dressing, in their mannerisms, in the place where they gathered. Does it sound familiar? And these people with their uh um dedication to the Old Testament, they also developed beliefs in angels, angel hierarchies, things not mentioned in the Bible, things that they got from Babylon, Greece, Rome, Meo, Persia. They were believing in all those things. uh they developed stories and doctrines about the afterlife and about the resurrection of the dead and they were they were basically influenced by the philosophies of the past Jewish teachers who they felt received the spirit of interpretation of what Moses wrote. Sounds familiar, right? Then there's this group called the Sadducees. And no, it doesn't mean they were sad. You see? I remember this from when I was a kid. I remember these message preachers playing with the words. No, Sadducees were a very influential group among the Jewish priesthood during the time of Jesus and they were noted for opposing the Pharisees. So, Sadducees opposed the Pharisees. What was the difference? Money. The Sadducees were very wealthy. They were the wealthy part a wealthy part of Jerusalem society and they said well we follow only the Torah only the first five books of the Bible of course you you Pharisees believe the Tanakh and you know the the the oral word and all of that you believe all these things we stick with only Moses we're like super legalists right and the Sadducees rejected any teaching of resurrection because Moses Moses does not talk of a resurrection. Um, so in other words, these these Sadducees cut out the book of Job, Samuel, Kings, all of that. They refuse to read any. They want to stick with only the first five books of the Bible. Do you think there's no people like that in the message? Right? They But the Sadducees rejected resurrection, angels, and spiritualism. any spiritualism. Don't come to us with any other prophet. Don't come to us with your baptism of the Holy Ghost. Don't come to us with your anointing. There's only one. There's Moses and nothing else. This is so good for wealthy people because wealthy people do not want to part with their money. Okay. &gt;&gt; And if some guy who's green or wet behind the ears, born yesterday, whatever phrases you want to say, pitches up and he's got some anointing and he comes and preaches fire and brimstone and then he's expecting you to to fund him. They don't want to do that. It's so easy to say, "Let's just stick with the first five books of the Bible." Obviously, that cancels out any other claim or ministry. So you can imagine you've got Jesus Christ coming from Bethlehem uh speaking to them the Sadducees who were these high and mighty silk robot people who were there to serve the wealthy and speaking to this riff raff who was supposedly anointed what they couldn't deal with he had actual healings and miracles and discernment of their heart something was pricking their hearts to keep following him to answer Truthfully, if they only cared about the wealthy and the and the first five books, why did he follow him around to ask him questions? &gt;&gt; Because he was even affecting the wealthy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His word was pulling the wealthy away from the Sadducees movement and the Pharisees movement. So, they were scared. These people also, the Sadducees were very legalistic about the temple. No, it must be this way. Must be the way Moses said that must be gold. That must be brass. That must be silver. This shouldn't be placed here. This shouldn't. Does that sound familiar? Those people who use cood like a rule book or brother Baron said this. You can't stray from that. You You're saying what brother Baron didn't say. Yes, we've had Sadducees too. We also know they serve the wealthy. All right. Then you get this group, the Essenes. They were very small group. There were about history tells us they were about 4,000 only. And these Essenes believed that all other Jews were apostate. &gt;&gt; All others, Pharisees, Sadducees, all other Jews were basically lost apostate. They were just serving lies, right? And the Essenes separated themselves into smaller communities. And these were apocalyptic, meaning they believed the end of the world was at hand. Everything was going to be destroyed. everyone else was going to be toast and we were all going to be saved. Sounds familiar. They believed in preparing for the end of the world, purification, live a holy lifestyle, live by abstinence, stay away from this, stay away from that. They believed in ritual cleansing by water baptism. In fact, uh I think history kind of thinks that the Christian church got water baptism from the Essenes, right? And u the believed you should not make vows. You should not sacrifice to animals. You should not own slaves. None of those. They just believe live a purified life, eat proper foods, drink clean water, don't wear this certain clothes, stay away from all evil. So in other words, they were a cult. They lived in camps. They literally lived in camps away from other unclean people. All right. Then there was this group called the zealots. In other words, zeal, right? Now the zealots, they were very small, very passionate, very political, influential Jewish faction. Uh how many of you know that Jesus had one of them among him? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. He was called Simon Zellet or Zilotes depending on how you pronounce it in Greek. But Simon the Zealot was one of the Lord Jesus' disciples, right? And um they believe that it seems like the Zealots were were could have been part of the problem bringing Christ to the Romans because they were causing they were always causing political unrest everywhere and uh it's believed that they might have caused the destruction of the temple in AD70 that that brought it about right they operated underground clandiston operations suspected of inciting a number of revolts against Rome I mean these people were so inspired by the word they wanted to bring they believed they could bring down the entire Roman Empire. Small group of people. &gt;&gt; Incredible. Right. Okay. This is some the the the fourth one is something you might be more familiar with because this word is still used today. It's the diaspora. The diaspora speaks of the Jewish people that live outside of Judea, outside of Israel. The diaspora are people, Jewish people who live all over the world. In other words, there were Jews living in Greece when when Christ came. There were Jews living in Babylonia when Christ came. There were Jews living in Arabia, in Northern Africa, in India, all over the place. There were there were Jews, the the chosen people living elsewhere when Jesus Christ came. And the word was passed to all of them. They were called the diaspora. And the diaspora um they did not return to Israel. They were also called the helanized Jews as in helanized as in from Greece and other places. They were now these Jews not living in Israel. They were diverse. They were liberal. They dressed like the place they came from. Right? If they were Grecian Jews, they dressed like the Greeks. They believed in this Grecian houses and Grecian uh uh uh foods and all. So these are children of Israel living in other countries. Sound familiar? They were educated by the west. Uh they had western thinking. They were very rich as compared with Jews from Israel. And they were literally ignorant of what was going on with Christ. All they knew was it was passed to them. There was this there was rumors of this Messiah. But if you're living in Greece or you're living on some coast in Portugal, it's so beautiful and you're hearing about this rumor of unrest in Israel. How much do you care? Not much, right? Okay. Then you had this non-religious ruling class right there in Israel. And this is the royal family of Herod. uh noblemen, politicians, the ruling class that were bought off by the Romans and who the Pharisees, Sadducees and all of them were forced to come to for political laws. Looks like we are being surrounded by monkeys. I don't mean these people. I mean literally there are monkeys around the church now. Uh so this ruling class were bought off by the um uh uh government of Rome. They were literally being paid by Pontius Pilate. They were and this is why when Christ was brought to Herod, he sent him to Pontious Pilot or Pilot sent him there, Herod sent him back. It was like I don't want to I you know I don't want to have this on my conscience. I'm sorry. It's like, you know, let the people deal with them themselves or or do this the Roman way or something, but I don't want my hands messed in this situation. So, this non-religious ruling class, remember, to be the non-religious ruling class and to control your religious people, you also have to give gifts to God. You're going to you're going to do things to show the people that you are religious. You're going to have to make a show one day when there's no rain. You're going to pray for rain. When there's no uh crops, you're going to pray for crops. When there's something, you're going to make a show of something. Which means every once in a while, these these politicians would step down from their uh uh places and come and do some religious ritual just to appease the public. You know that, right? So these are political wealthy and non-religious uh working class they would be publicans you know when the Bible speaks of publicans publicans are is actually a word for tax collectors so they are Jews who collected taxes on behalf of Herod and behalf of uh Rome and the people hated publicans and here's the thing you know one of Jesus's uh disciples was a publican Matthew and then Jesus also met with Zak a tax collector and then he was being criticized by the Pharisees and Sadducees for sitting with the publicans and even the poor people watching Christ interact with the publicans. What is wrong with you? &gt;&gt; How can you meet with these horrible people who take our money and give it to Rome? What is this showing you? The world doesn't care who it's coming to. &gt;&gt; You're fighting with each other based on convenience. He doesn't care who he's coming to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And of course the the the the guys everyone hates the public sector governmentrun places. These are all non-religious uh ruling class. Okay. Then you got the mixed working class. The mixed working class is basically the poor, the merchants, the traders. You know, they're unable to keep perfect religion. Look, look at you nice people sitting there. You know, you're dressed nice, you're you can read, you're educated. Hopefully, most of you have been through school and got your matrix. Some of you may not have, but you can read the Bible. You can read the message. Uh some of you sitting here in message churches and online, you uh have this mental prowess to read a quote and to argue with me about it and to tell me you could be right. And yet there are people out there who cannot read. So you think you know doctrine and the seals and the thunders what? Just because you're educated. &gt;&gt; What about all these people who can't read the message? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So they're never going to stand up to your holiness. What? Just because they can't read? &gt;&gt; So they're they're in the streets. They can't read. They can't write. They they'll if they try and read a message, they fall asleep in 5 minutes. So, are you measuring holiness in your message churches across the world simply because you can read better than someone else? &gt;&gt; You can understand better than someone else. There are literally people in this world who cannot read and write, who will not be able to keep your perfect religion. They always need assistance from the religious and the wealthy. They're there are widows. There are orphans. They always need help from the church. They are uneducated. They have mixed belief. Now, when you are uneducated, you are you don't reason much, which means you are more likely going to follow someone who has got signs, wonders, miracles. That's the trap. This is why the poor in the hedges and highways flocked to Christ because he didn't have a complicated doctrine but he had signs. And this doesn't make these people great because when it came time for them to hear the word, they crossed the sea. All they wanted was food. They were not really interested in what he was teaching and then he slammed them for that. &gt;&gt; You see? So it doesn't mean if you're poor or you're educated that you're any better or any holy. These are all the people available to Christ at his first coming. I'm just amazed by message people, you know, they were taken from poor neighborhoods, poorest suburbs in wherever you Durban, Johannesburg, Cape Town, wherever you're from. And then after 20 years, you're suddenly a professor of the message. And then you're because you can keep the message because you read COD and you got this great understanding of how dressing must be or this great understanding of how the church order must be. Now suddenly you and your family because you are able to read, your kids are able to read, you now got this holiness down perfect where there are other people who cannot read the quotes like you are and you look at them and you look at them as unholy. Why? just cuz you can read and then the people who can't read are looking at you thinking you hypocrites you can read you know all the stuff and we know you don't really keep it. So mixed workingclass people some were religious in their own way and righteous with whatever that means. Okay with with with whatever they had they were righteous. Like if they had little in their homes, if they had a a a a mud hut with uh one room and you know straw for a bed or something with whatever they had, they tried to be righteous. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now here's the thing. Paul was a Pharisee. The first apostle to the Gentiles was a Pharisee. &gt;&gt; That means he was educated. He was religious. He come from a background of believing in angels and hierarchies, resurrection of the dead. Uh uh believing in both the Torah and the rest of the Tanakh uh and hearing all the oral truths and the written truths. And that's where he came from. When you look at Paul's writing, you can actually tell his background. One of the disciples of Christ was Simon the Zealot. We may not know what group Peter and Andrew came from, but they definitely look like mixed working class cuz they came from a group of poor fishermen. Matthew was a publican and a tax collector. Then there may have been others like the 70 who came from all the above groups, but they were attracted to Christ. They decided to follow him and and receive the spirit and go about healing and casting out devils. Every person had his own background and belief and they all disagreed with each other. They were only agreeing with him at the moment. &gt;&gt; Do you realize why they're literally disciples surrounding Christ and dissenting among themselves? &gt;&gt; So many times they're busy arguing with can you imagine Christ telling them, you know, the I must be lifted up and and you destroy this temple in 3 days. I'll raise it up again. and he spoke about the temp the the the that concerning his body, the temple of his body. And the Pharisees in the group would be saying, "Yeah, that's perfect." And the Sadducees in the group said, "No, no, no. There must be something wrong." And they're busy arguing and Christ discerns their heart. Or maybe there's a zealatus. Why are we even talking about this stuff? Let's go take Rome, you know. And the other quiet ones are like, "No, no, just let him speak." You know, he's got these words that touch us. workingass people be like the fisherman said just shush man just let him speak we just want to hear more you guys have read all this we haven't even heard yet right they all had their own idea about the Messiah and how he should come every last one of them had their own ideas people like the diaspora actually didn't even care they don't care about the Messiah coming literally enjoying their Grecian lifestyle They're like hoping the Messiah doesn't come now. You know, maybe he comes later. Let me enjoy my life and die. Sounds familiar. Know some of you young people. I hope the rapture doesn't take place. I want to be married first. I want to have babies. After you have babies, when's a rapture coming? Poor pathetic humans. So the only problem I see in the type is that when the Messiah actually came, none of their beliefs led them to the truth. Not one group said, "We are devoted to you." Not one. There were just people that came out of there. Can you see that? And here's the other the second point is Messiah did not validate or join any one of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought them from all of them. See that? There's a quote brother says, "God doesn't even care about your doctrine. He gave you the Holy Ghost anyway." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You know that? Yeah. Yeah, that's in the message. So Christ when he came, he did not align himself with any particular doctrine of that time. However, what is noticeable is that those who followed him and his disciples uh uh would be people who came from from all of these factions. So even having the background they had, those who followed him were able to learn from their experience. So by Christ bringing all of them in like one from each group or whoever he started getting questions from their background and answering questions from each background and the others didn't realize they're learning from the others questions. I hope you can see where I'm going with this. So even having the background they had, those who followed him were able to learn from the experience in some way and they recognized the real coming of the Lord. They would try to go back. The Sadducee in the group would try to go back to the Sadducee and you got to come. No, sorry. We're not interested. Why? And the Pharisee would do the same. And the Zealots would do the same. No, sorry. We have our mission. We have our leader. We have this. We have that. We're not interested. Which means these people where they came from, they try to go back and get their believers to come and they were flat out refused, rejected, kicked out. Sounds familiar. Going to ask that a lot. When it comes to the message of the hour, there are a lot of negative things, right? So, now I'm going to get to the message.
