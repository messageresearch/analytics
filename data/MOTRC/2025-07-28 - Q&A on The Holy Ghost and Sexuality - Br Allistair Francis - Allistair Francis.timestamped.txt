[0:02] We're going to read from Acts chapter 10
[0:05] verse 38.
[0:08] All right. Acts 10:38
[0:12] says, "How God anointed Jesus of
[0:15] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
[0:18] power, who went about doing good and
[0:21] healing all that were oppressed of the
[0:24] devil, for God was with him." Amen. So,
[0:28] we're going to look at that statement.
[0:30] God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the
[0:33] Holy Ghost and with power.
[0:36] So, once again, uh good to be here with
[0:39] you and uh greetings in his precious
[0:44] name. So, um we're going to look at uh
[0:47] question and answers. Brother Michael,
[0:50] this I don't know if the this is not
[0:52] working, but we'll just uh All right.
[0:54] Question and answers. Uh let's go to a
[0:56] title page. So, it's going to be
[0:58] question and answers um on the Holy
[1:01] Ghost and sexuality. But don't worry
[1:04] about the last part. It's not going to
[1:05] be uh too hectic. It's just questions.
[1:08] So, what's happened is uh from the time
[1:11] I I preached and uh as I'm traveling
[1:15] through, I'm starting to get questions
[1:17] and I've got questions from young
[1:20] people, some beautiful questions from
[1:22] young people and from others. And so
[1:24] I've got four questions that we're going
[1:26] to do today. And um
[1:30] uh but I'm going to explain something to
[1:32] you just to make you understand. So
[1:36] the message the message community in the
[1:40] world is not as you think it is. It's
[1:45] very diverse. It's very different.
[1:48] Um there's I wouldn't even say that you
[1:52] go to churches and you feel that
[1:55] everyone is united. It isn't that way. I
[1:58] mean in our own city you can barely get
[2:01] along with each other and yet we are
[2:03] serving the same word. We are of the and
[2:06] I think maybe it's got to be that way so
[2:08] we don't become a denomination. So I'm
[2:11] not averse to that. I'm just I love the
[2:13] people of God. I love the ministries. I
[2:17] love to listen to different ministries
[2:18] and I love learning of the things of God
[2:21] but do not ever think that when we go to
[2:24] places
[2:26] it's just a case of everyone accepts uh
[2:29] you know who you are what you say so I
[2:31] mean like the message I preached on
[2:33] dimensions when I preached it first here
[2:36] in a in a combined in Durban it was
[2:38] largely rejected
[2:40] the next message I preached at brother
[2:42] Charles which was on the seventh seal
[2:44] that was the next service I preached at
[2:46] combined service it was largely rejected
[2:49] and yet everywhere else it's accepted
[2:52] and when I say rejected I mean when I
[2:54] preach dimensions here the next day I
[2:56] was getting hammered on WhatsApp groups
[2:59] &gt;&gt; by the ministers here in Durban for the
[3:02] things that I said and you just got to
[3:04] roll with it because
[3:07] we're preaching I'm telling you brother
[3:09] Steve was preaching things from like for
[3:12] example let me give you an example North
[3:14] America is a very difficult place. They
[3:17] are so divided with so many things. When
[3:21] I got there in 1995, they were having
[3:24] such a problem with the return ministry.
[3:27] Most of you don't even know what that is
[3:29] because it's never affected us. We've
[3:32] never you never seen people in Africa
[3:35] claiming that brother Ben Baram is going
[3:36] to return and preach and he's going to
[3:39] be here 40 days before the translation.
[3:41] Have any of you heard that? No. Yeah,
[3:44] you may have heard that, but do you know
[3:46] of any churches here in South Africa
[3:48] that that preached that? No, that stuff
[3:51] has never affected us. So when we went
[3:54] there in '95, we were there for for 32
[3:57] days and brother Steve preached 30
[4:00] services. We were moving from state to
[4:03] state through America and Canada. And
[4:05] every church we went to was being
[4:07] affected by this. And it seemed these
[4:09] people in 1995 had not got a handle on
[4:12] what the third pool was.
[4:14] And u what I'm saying to you is we're
[4:17] going there to where the message comes
[4:19] from. And we've already been preaching
[4:21] the third pool. Brother Steven been
[4:23] preaching the time of life. The seven
[4:25] seal is open. Preaching the uh I'll
[4:28] write this trail one more time, the
[4:30] truth of it. And we get there and the
[4:32] people are struggling to some of the the
[4:34] biggest churches you might think of.
[4:36] They were having splits and divides and
[4:38] they were just and this is how it is.
[4:40] And you go there, you preach the seventh
[4:42] seal. You think we get there and you
[4:44] you're preaching we're in the eighth
[4:46] day. We're out of Leodysia. We're in the
[4:48] bride age. And you get there and there's
[4:50] people just against you.
[4:53] and you you you preach the seventh seal
[4:56] and there's people there who don't
[4:58] believe the seventh seal is open
[5:00] &gt;&gt; and we're shocked because you're coming
[5:02] from Africa and you the culture has
[5:05] always been that America has to send
[5:06] missionaries to Africa because you know
[5:09] we're ignorant and we're the natives who
[5:12] everyone has to save. That's how it has
[5:14] always been. And then we get there and
[5:16] realize we are not even confounded on
[5:19] these doctrines. Seven thunder, seven
[5:21] virtues comes from there. Peruia comes
[5:24] from there. Two lords comes from there.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; To the point where I got so fed up with
[5:28] with them in in I think it would have
[5:31] been 2010. Oh no, not 2020. After 2013,
[5:34] brother Bob, this is how I got to meet
[5:37] brother Chad. Brother Bob from our
[5:39] church came to me and brought me discs,
[5:41] you know, and he was telling me there's
[5:42] brother Chad, there's brother Eugene
[5:44] Brawn, you got to listen to these
[5:46] brothers and brother Steve Bryson. And
[5:48] he said they're one I I and he said
[5:50] they're wonderful. They they're
[5:51] preaching the open book, brother. I said
[5:53] to him, "Brother Bob, please do not give
[5:55] me any more American preachers. I'm done
[5:57] with them because they come here and
[5:58] cause trouble." And uh I'm just telling
[6:02] you this because um you know this is
[6:05] what it is when you get there and you've
[6:07] got to face things because there are
[6:09] nation grounded on the Christian
[6:13] principles and of lately Pentecostalism
[6:15] very steeped in Pentecostalism and
[6:17] because brother Barham came from there
[6:20] and because all the ministries that were
[6:22] with brother Barham were there in a
[6:24] large influence to most of the churches
[6:28] and um So I told brother Bob, you know,
[6:32] I just I don't want to hear anything.
[6:33] And eventually he said to me, "No, no,
[6:35] you've got to listen to this, brother,
[6:37] brother Chad." And so I said, "You know
[6:39] what? Okay, I don't even have a DVD
[6:41] player. Uh I don't know how I'm going to
[6:43] do this." And eventually someone gave me
[6:45] a laptop with a with a DVD player and I
[6:48] stuck it in and I listened to Brother
[6:49] Chad and I was, "Wow, this is amazing.
[6:52] this brother is uh he's speaking our
[6:54] language,
[6:55] &gt;&gt; you know, and u so I didn't even know
[6:59] where brother Duno was after that. I
[7:01] didn't even know he was a pastor. And um
[7:04] so a lot of things had happened and
[7:06] ministries that started coming up and we
[7:08] were just growing without anybody
[7:10] knowing us. I didn't even care to be
[7:11] known. I wasn't interested in doing
[7:14] outreach work in this place because
[7:16] every bush you kick, a pastor is popping
[7:18] out. And it's like if you step on
[7:21] anybody's grounds then you're offending
[7:22] them. So we just stayed real quiet,
[7:25] preached the word, grew as a church, you
[7:28] know, and that's how we were happy. So
[7:31] but
[7:33] now something has happened because I get
[7:35] to brother brother Chad's place. I get
[7:37] to uh America and then I preach on the
[7:40] Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit. To start
[7:42] off with that wasn't my title. My title
[7:44] was a purposeful nature. the subject was
[7:47] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit and I
[7:49] was going to bring a point and um um so
[7:55] but anyway the the the video goes up on
[7:57] YouTube and people listen to it. Now,
[8:00] now here is a big problem with YouTube,
[8:02] which is why I don't like it. Because
[8:05] people listen to the meeting or what you
[8:08] preach without being there under the
[8:10] anointing.
[8:11] &gt;&gt; And when there when you're not there
[8:13] under the anointing, it's so easy for
[8:15] you to look at it, rewind it, go back,
[8:19] rewind it. I don't know what you say now
[8:21] with with videos, but you take it back,
[8:23] you go back, you slice, cut, peel
[8:26] everything, and you're not even there
[8:28] under the anointing. And it's very easy
[8:30] to criticize people when you were not
[8:32] even there in the service. And I don't
[8:36] think it was a few days that I already
[8:39] started getting push back and I didn't
[8:41] know about this. I only learned about
[8:42] this when I got back home. Now I didn't
[8:46] even know about all this issue because
[8:49] they they had a problem with me as if I
[8:52] was trying to say the Holy Ghost and the
[8:54] Holy Spirit are two different things,
[8:56] which is not what I did. And um anyway,
[9:00] what's uh the reason why I even prayed I
[9:02] I want to be contrite in my spirit and I
[9:05] I want to do this as with the greatest
[9:08] humility. So I'm not doing this to fight
[9:11] back at them, but to answer questions
[9:12] that were given to me. So without even
[9:16] knowing what was going on, I already
[9:17] started receiving questions from some
[9:19] young people and things about the Holy
[9:21] Spirit, the Holy Ghost, and so on. So
[9:23] that's what we're going to do. Now, the
[9:26] the the thing about it is I I I
[9:29] literally got accused of preaching a
[9:31] false doctrine.
[9:33] By the time I got back, it's like I'm
[9:35] preaching a false doctrine. And and
[9:38] that's how fast it goes to he's
[9:40] preaching a false doctrine,
[9:42] &gt;&gt; right? It's incredible. Uh and missed
[9:45] the whole point of the whole thing. Now
[9:48] this subject I preached to us in 2012
[9:54] from 2012 to now have any of you people
[9:59] seen the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit as a
[10:01] doctrine. You don't even know because we
[10:04] don't even make a big thing. When people
[10:05] make a doctrine of something they write
[10:07] it in songs they make songs out of it.
[10:10] They uh make a big deal out of it. They
[10:13] they speak about it and make it. None of
[10:15] you even know or think that I make any
[10:18] significance between Holy Ghost and Holy
[10:19] Spirit in this church. We've never done
[10:22] that. And so but you know that when I
[10:26] spoke about in 2012 uh our series began
[10:29] with the question the question that was
[10:32] sent to me was from the message two
[10:34] particular quotes where brother Brandham
[10:36] says uh where brothers asked the
[10:39] question is the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[10:40] Spirit the uh different and brother Bham
[10:43] said no they're the same. That's where
[10:45] our series starts from. And for me and
[10:48] the way God has wired me is when I see
[10:51] that I just don't get caged by that.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; To me, I know brother Benam is a part of
[10:56] the seven seals. So when he says
[10:58] something and when there's a question on
[11:00] something in me, it's like uh there's
[11:03] something in front of me and I'm chasing
[11:05] it and I'm not going to stop until I
[11:07] find out what's going on and and it
[11:10] turns into a series. So that's what
[11:12] happened with us and it blessed us so
[11:14] much brought out so much and um so
[11:19] what what I realized in that time from
[11:22] 2012 was that things were happening in
[11:24] South Africa and I remember going to a
[11:27] meeting where there was a brother from
[11:30] another country who preached here and
[11:31] said any minister any pastor who does
[11:35] not have the gifts of the Holy Ghost
[11:39] following his ministry is source.
[11:42] He has to have a supernatural element to
[11:45] his ministry. And that was a pastor from
[11:48] Africa who was preaching here in Derby.
[11:50] And I heard him say that I was there and
[11:52] you had a whole bunch of people uh
[11:55] standing up and shouting and you know
[11:57] and when when I I'm not a person who
[12:01] likes to fight with quotes or
[12:02] scriptures. I like to say what's on my
[12:05] heart and because for every quote I have
[12:08] someone has a hundred others or for
[12:10] every quote someone else has I have a
[12:12] hundred others and then we waste time on
[12:15] quotes but just say what's on your heart
[12:18] &gt;&gt; so when I look at it and I say what's in
[12:20] my heart I say but which one of you has
[12:23] supernatural element
[12:27] what are you jumping up for
[12:29] &gt;&gt; what do you do you prophesy speak in
[12:31] tongues is Holy Ghost fire over you or
[12:34] you know like what what is it? Where's
[12:36] the supernatural element and but
[12:39] everyone claims to and apparently the
[12:41] the greatest supernatural element right
[12:43] now is shouting.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Okay, because that seems to be an uh and
[12:50] some evidence of the Holy Ghost.
[12:53] So that's been going on for over a
[12:55] decade and they've been trying to
[12:56] resurrect that and they somehow feel
[12:59] that is an evidence or an outpouring of
[13:00] the Holy Ghost when you get people to
[13:02] shout.
[13:04] So I don't know. And then this thing has
[13:07] reached America. And and to me it's a
[13:10] joke because America doesn't even know
[13:12] what noise is
[13:15] because as as vibrant as they think they
[13:18] are when they come to Africa or when
[13:21] Africa goes to them
[13:24] they they pale in comparison because we
[13:26] are from Africa.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; In here the noise is where it
[13:30] originates. Yes,
[13:32] &gt;&gt; the drums, the shouting, the dancing,
[13:34] the screaming, the theatrics, the
[13:37] superstitions,
[13:38] everything is a sign, every dream is a
[13:40] is a message from God. This is where we
[13:43] came from. And when we see them trying
[13:46] to resurrect what happened in the 70s
[13:48] and 80s that happened with Joseph
[13:50] Coleman movement, to us, this is you
[13:52] you're trying to bring back something
[13:54] that already died and failed in our
[13:56] country. And we know what results it
[13:59] brought and how dangerous it is.
[14:01] Yeah.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; So, we've we've walked a long road,
[14:06] right? And my purpose for preaching on
[14:09] the the the Holy Ghost and the Holy
[14:11] Spirit in the way that that it was
[14:13] presented was to bring clarity, but I
[14:16] instead I think I brought a little bit
[14:18] of confusion. So I do take um you know
[14:23] that that perhaps I should have I mean
[14:25] I'm I'm condensing like a 20 part series
[14:28] into one service and uh but anyway
[14:33] when you read let's go to the scripture.
[14:35] Let's see if this works. There we go.
[14:37] How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with
[14:40] the Holy Ghost and with power. Okay. So
[14:42] we're going to get to some of the
[14:43] discrepancies in a short while. Now,
[14:47] this is what I don't like about the
[14:51] message community
[14:53] in general because when they can't
[14:56] explain something, they act like
[14:58] ostriches with their heads stuck in the
[15:00] sand.
[15:02] When I ask them, "How do you explain
[15:04] this?"
[15:05] They don't know how to explain this. And
[15:08] particularly our children, because when
[15:10] you tell them, "We're not trinitarian.
[15:12] We're not wonders." But now explain
[15:14] this. God anointed Jesus of Nazareth
[15:18] with the Holy Ghost and with power. Does
[15:21] that mean Jesus of Nazareth did not have
[15:23] the Holy Ghost before?
[15:27] Because he was anointed at John's
[15:29] baptism. So that means was he not the
[15:32] fullness of the Godhead bodily before
[15:34] John's baptism?
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:37] &gt;&gt; Did he not have the Holy Spirit in him?
[15:40] Now when I get to youth camps, these are
[15:43] the questions I get asked. This is the
[15:45] reason why I've got to go in, dissect
[15:48] things, slice it open, study it to
[15:50] pieces before I get there and answer
[15:53] questions of the young people of today.
[15:55] I don't get questions on how to redo um
[15:58] Godhead theory for old people.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; That's not the questions I get asked.
[16:04] When when you have young people
[16:06] struggling with immorality, they're not
[16:08] interested in your theory and how right
[16:10] you are with quotes scriptures.
[16:12] You got to get down to reality with
[16:14] them, right?
[16:16] &gt;&gt; So God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with a
[16:19] whole No matter how you like to gloss
[16:21] over it, this looks like there are three
[16:24] people in the Godhead.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; Right. Who who is God? Is God the Father
[16:32] or is God the Holy Ghost? Who is it that
[16:35] anointed Jesus? And why did Jesus have
[16:37] to be anointed? What does it mean that
[16:39] he was anointed?
[16:41] If you say you have a revelation of the
[16:43] Godhead and you know what the Holy
[16:45] Spirit or the Holy Ghost uh whatever you
[16:48] want to call it is, I would love to hear
[16:50] you explain the scripture right now. Let
[16:53] me let me show you how. Right. If you're
[16:56] a trinitarian, it's pretty
[16:57] straightforward. God the Father anointed
[17:00] God the Son with God the Holy Ghost.
[17:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; Which is not wrong,
[17:07] but it offers no revelation.
[17:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. It just allows for the splitting of
[17:12] God into three persons. Saying that God
[17:15] the Father anointed, God the Son with
[17:17] God the Holy Ghost allows as it mulls
[17:21] over in your mind and matures, it it it
[17:25] makes you move into trinitarianism.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; It splits God into three. Right? If
[17:30] you're a weird kind of oneness person,
[17:34] then you will say God anointed God with
[17:36] God.
[17:40] Agreed.
[17:41] &gt;&gt; Right. If you're a confused message
[17:44] person, you're still struggling for an
[17:46] explanation.
[17:48] If you're an intellectual message
[17:50] believer, you're going to say, "God
[17:52] anoints the word made flesh with the
[17:54] spirit of adoption."
[17:58] Jesus said, "Believe me for the work
[18:00] sake, the works that I do in my father's
[18:02] name." And trust me, nobody gives me the
[18:05] same answer. Everyone has their own
[18:06] answer in the message.
[18:09] Not that I want the same answer. I'm
[18:11] just saying when you ask this question,
[18:13] you actually realize who really
[18:15] understands the Godhead.
[18:18] If you have the open book, you're going
[18:21] to say what this means is God vindicated
[18:25] his chosen vessel
[18:28] with manifested works of great ability.
[18:33] That's what it means.
[18:35] God anointed the vessel he chose with
[18:38] manifested works of great ability. It's
[18:40] not even a godhead question.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; But you only see that if you have the
[18:45] open book.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; It actually is not even a godhead
[18:49] statement.
[18:50] It's like saying um at a specific time
[18:54] when when it was time for the Lord Jesus
[18:56] to go into his ministry, he gave him the
[18:59] spirit of God came upon that body and
[19:01] anointed it with specific abilities.
[19:05] That's all that it means.
[19:08] It's not even talking about godhead. But
[19:10] people will get tied up in the details.
[19:12] But you'll only have that if you have
[19:14] the open book.
[19:16] Now people look at the scriptures and
[19:18] try to argue the viewpoint and miss the
[19:20] real scripture. What is the truth being
[19:22] spoken here? Right? The truth is God
[19:25] created his own body to bring salvation
[19:29] to mankind.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; God then allowed that body to be born of
[19:33] a woman and allowed it to be subjected
[19:36] to experiencing normal human life from
[19:38] infancy to adulthood. Yeah.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; But when the time was right, he gave
[19:43] that body a signal and an ability to go
[19:47] out and do things that would vindicate
[19:49] and testify that the body that he was
[19:52] dwelling in was not merely any man but a
[19:55] God man, the son of man.
[19:59] &gt;&gt; That's what that whole thing actually
[20:00] signifies. God made himself a body
[20:05] destined it to go through normal human
[20:06] life till it comes to a point where he
[20:09] gives it ability and a signal to start
[20:11] going out and preaching producing the
[20:13] ministry it's meant for and bring
[20:15] salvation to mankind. There's no
[20:17] trinitarian doctrine discussion in that.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; Do you see how far from the truth you
[20:25] would be if you do not have the open
[20:27] book? Do you see how you won't be able
[20:30] to have revelation if you have a
[20:32] denominational understanding of the Holy
[20:35] Ghost?
[20:36] &gt;&gt; Right? Why would Jesus need to be
[20:39] anointed with the Holy Ghost? If he was
[20:42] already the fullness of the Godhead
[20:43] bodily,
[20:46] that's why it is important to know what
[20:48] the Holy Ghost is and why you must have
[20:50] it. This is the reason for us preaching
[20:53] that series on the Holy Ghost uh in
[20:56] 2012. Remember that what the middle of
[20:59] the road with the Holy Ghost.
[21:01] And uh so I'm going to go to question
[21:04] one and then we're going to get into
[21:07] what the discrepancy here is about. All
[21:10] right. So let's go to the question
[21:13] Michael
[21:17] question one. Okay. So this is the first
[21:20] question from what you preached that is
[21:23] uh in the United States.
[21:26] I understand the need to distinguish
[21:28] between the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[21:30] and the person of the Holy Ghost. It is
[21:32] true that many do not understand this. I
[21:35] also don't understand everything
[21:37] completely but I believe the word
[21:39] completely.
[21:41] How I love sincere questions. However,
[21:44] there will always be a problem with all
[21:46] the statements made in the message where
[21:48] the prophet uses the two phrases as you
[21:51] said interchangeably.
[21:53] How does one navigate through all of
[21:55] that without bringing confusion? This is
[21:57] a sincere question. This is saying I get
[22:00] that you that you're showing us there's
[22:02] a difference between the baptism of the
[22:03] Holy Ghost and the person of Christ and
[22:06] I believe the word completely. That
[22:07] means this person is not resistant to
[22:09] what I'm saying. It's not even but all
[22:12] they're saying is when I go through the
[22:13] message or if I read my Bible and I'm
[22:15] seeing Holy Spirit and Holy Ghost, am I
[22:17] supposed to make a a distinction? Uh,
[22:21] and I don't even do that, right? But am
[22:24] I supposed to make a distinction? And am
[22:26] I supposed to make a big deal of it when
[22:28] I read the message now and I see Holy
[22:30] Spirit then Holy Ghost? Am I supposed to
[22:32] be so conscious of making a distinction
[22:34] between the two words to to simply say
[22:37] no? The answer is no. We don't have to
[22:39] do that. That's not what I was saying at
[22:41] all when I preached this message. But I
[22:44] want to start with this because I want
[22:46] to show you where our series actually
[22:49] began from. Let's go to um the first
[22:51] quote. So this is an actual question
[22:54] from question and answers. Um someone
[22:57] asked brother Brandham, we know the
[22:58] blessed holy spirit is not given to vain
[23:00] repetition in laying out the holy
[23:02] scriptures. So please tell me why the
[23:05] word Holy Spirit is used sometimes and
[23:07] the word Holy Ghost is used at other
[23:09] times. I know there is a valid reason
[23:12] about reason for this and I would like
[23:14] to know why. Here's brother Mar's
[23:16] answer. It's the self same word. A
[23:19] spirit and ghost is the very same thing.
[23:21] A ghost or spirit doesn't matter.
[23:23] They're just the same self.
[23:27] Let's go to the next quote.
[23:30] Um how can I overcome? Here, brother
[23:32] Mammy's talking about some holiness
[23:34] people that he met or I'm not sure. As I
[23:37] was talking to someone the other day,
[23:38] they're being very careful, even many of
[23:40] the holiness groups, not to call the
[23:42] Holy Ghost Holy Ghost cuz they identify
[23:46] themselves with Pentecostals when they
[23:48] do that. So the people in the
[23:49] denominational churches at that time who
[23:52] did not want to use the the term Holy
[23:54] Ghost because the term Holy Ghost became
[23:56] fashionable among Pentecostals. So there
[23:58] were people being careful and were using
[24:00] the term holy spirit right they say holy
[24:04] spirit see keep them saying holy ghost
[24:06] because the pentecostal common people
[24:08] just call it what the bible says holy
[24:10] ghost brother bam statement which holy
[24:13] go hol hol hol hol hol hol hol hol hol
[24:13] hol holy spirit and holy ghost is the
[24:15] same thing but they're very careful
[24:16] about it they don't want to be
[24:18] identified with them tongues speaking
[24:20] people and that's the holy spirit itself
[24:23] amen so when you look at these quotes
[24:26] which is where our series in 2012
[24:28] started from you say brother Alistister
[24:30] your statements making the difference is
[24:32] just canceled because of what brother
[24:35] Brandham says because it's clear brother
[24:38] he says the holy spirit and the holy
[24:40] ghost is the same right and so obviously
[24:45] when I see quotes like this here this
[24:47] doesn't stop me that's what I'm saying
[24:50] because there's an understanding behind
[24:52] this
[24:53] &gt;&gt; there's a reason why the prophet for
[24:54] example brother Benam even says Father
[24:57] is the same as Holy Ghost.
[25:01] Brother, there's another quote where he
[25:03] says, "Father is the self, same spirit
[25:05] as Holy Spirit." Holy Ghost. Does that
[25:08] mean they're the same? All right. So,
[25:10] hold on.
[25:12] The first thing you must know is if you
[25:14] think you're going to get the revelation
[25:16] of this whole thing from just two quotes
[25:20] as compared with thousands of others
[25:23] and the scriptures, then we're in
[25:25] trouble. And I tell you why we're in
[25:27] trouble because we've already seen the
[25:29] trouble that's been taking place amongst
[25:31] our young people. And that we're going
[25:33] to get to at the end. Firstly, in the
[25:36] message I preached even in BCF, I didn't
[25:40] make the differentiation.
[25:42] I was not the one who made the
[25:44] differentiation. I merely pointed out
[25:46] that the translators of the Bible did
[25:48] it. Right? And that brother Brandham
[25:52] made a difference between. So the
[25:54] translators of the Bible made a
[25:56] difference between Holy Spirit, Holy
[25:59] Ghost, right? Literally seven times Holy
[26:03] Spirit is spoken in the Bible, three
[26:05] times in the Old Testament, four times
[26:07] in the New, and 89 times only in the New
[26:10] Testament do we hear the words Holy
[26:11] Ghost. I didn't do that. The translators
[26:15] did it. Right? And um brother Brandham
[26:19] then makes a difference which the Bible
[26:21] doesn't do.
[26:23] The Bible does not say baptism of the
[26:25] Holy Ghost or baptism of the Holy
[26:27] Spirit. It does not say that. The Bible
[26:29] does not even make a difference between
[26:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the person
[26:33] of the Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham does
[26:35] that.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Right. So there are times when brother
[26:40] Bam uses the term Holy Spirit and he's
[26:43] referring to now this is the reason why
[26:45] I got into this because the young people
[26:49] and some because of how it was being
[26:51] preached at the time when sometimes when
[26:53] brother Baron speaks about the Holy
[26:55] Spirit he's actually referring to the
[26:57] baptism
[26:59] and there's times where he's speaking
[27:01] about the Holy Spirit and then that time
[27:03] he's speaking about the person
[27:05] and then it's a time brother speaking he
[27:07] says says the Holy Ghost and he's
[27:08] speaking about the baptism of the Holy
[27:10] Ghost. And there's another time he
[27:12] speaks about he uses the word Holy Ghost
[27:14] and he's speaking about the person of
[27:15] the Holy Ghost. So what I was saying to
[27:18] them was when you're reading, make sure
[27:22] you make the differentiation between the
[27:25] gifts and the person.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Because that's two different things.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Okay. So all that I was doing was and I
[27:34] feel like yeah maybe it wasn't necessary
[27:37] for me to have gone into that but I was
[27:39] I was trying to share the excitement of
[27:42] the study that brings us up to that
[27:45] understanding right maybe that
[27:47] complicated things for the North
[27:49] Americans but I I don't know it didn't
[27:52] do anything for us here uh when we spoke
[27:54] about it there are many times where
[27:57] brother man uses both the phrases
[27:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost and baptism of
[28:02] the Holy Spirit. And there is no
[28:04] difference. If he says baptism of the
[28:05] Holy Ghost, it's the same thing as
[28:07] baptism of the Holy Spirit. There isn't
[28:08] any difference, right? It's throughout
[28:11] the message because now when you look at
[28:13] those two phrases, baptism of the Holy
[28:15] Ghost, baptism of the Holy Spirit, we
[28:17] don't you don't have a problem with that
[28:18] because the word baptism sorts it out,
[28:21] right? So there is no need for us to
[28:24] distinguish between. So here I'm saying
[28:27] it openly so that people will hear it
[28:29] and gladly brother Tim will put this on
[28:32] YouTube to clear up anyone else who's
[28:34] who who's listening to that. I am saying
[28:37] it there is no need for anyone to go and
[28:40] make a differentiation between Holy
[28:43] Spirit and Holy Ghost or make a big deal
[28:46] out of it because I believe everything
[28:49] the prophet said. It is the selfsame
[28:52] being.
[28:55] It's not two different entities,
[28:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[28:58] So most people um or rather there's and
[29:02] there's no there's no need for us to
[29:04] make the distinguishing between the two
[29:07] and I'm saying this today
[29:11] today in 2025 today in our age today in
[29:14] the capstone age in brother Brandham's
[29:16] day there's no need because I'll show
[29:19] you some quotes how surprising and
[29:22] shocking they are okay to most people
[29:26] today in the message And in
[29:28] Christianity, the two phrases are
[29:30] exactly the same. Right? To all
[29:33] Christians, actually, they're just the
[29:35] same. And there's a reason for that. Uh
[29:37] and and basically to Christians, it
[29:39] means the same person in the Godhead.
[29:43] And yet, not many people truly
[29:45] understand what the Holy Spirit is.
[29:50] Most people cannot even differentiate
[29:53] between Holy Ghost and the Father.
[30:00] I know this. I've spoken to ministers.
[30:03] I've spoken to message people. If I ask
[30:06] them, the father is a spirit. The holy
[30:10] ghost is what? A spirit. So what's the
[30:13] difference?
[30:16] What's the difference between father and
[30:18] holy spirit?
[30:21] And message people do not know.
[30:25] message ministers do not know. They
[30:28] don't even know why it's called holy
[30:30] spirit.
[30:33] What is the difference between the the
[30:35] god is a spirit? Is that right?
[30:37] &gt;&gt; God is a spirit and those that worship
[30:39] him must worship him in spirit and in
[30:40] truth. So what is the difference between
[30:42] god who is a spirit, the father who is a
[30:44] spirit and the holy spirit? I stood
[30:48] there in North America and said to them,
[30:50] "Holy Spirit is the spirit of God in
[30:54] reference to man."
[31:00] That's the revelation. That's the
[31:02] difference. It's a spirit that has to do
[31:04] with man. The spirit of God, it has to
[31:06] do with man,
[31:09] right?
[31:12] How do we know this? The prophet asked
[31:14] this and asked this question. We're not
[31:17] asked the question. He actually does it
[31:18] very sarcastically. And I like him that
[31:21] he's sarcastic. The prophet asked
[31:23] sarcastically, "If the father was
[31:26] Jesus's father, and if the Bible said
[31:29] that Mary conceived of the Holy Ghost,
[31:32] &gt;&gt; did Jesus have two fathers?"
[31:34] &gt;&gt; Remember that?
[31:35] &gt;&gt; He also used the bad word for
[31:37] illegitimate.
[31:39] &gt;&gt; Remember he said that makes him an
[31:41] illegitimate son having two fathers.
[31:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Right. And he asked and and he asked
[31:46] that to stump trinitarians. And he had
[31:50] the message people mocking the
[31:51] trinitarians. See, he got them. Then I I
[31:55] asked the message people and understood
[31:56] that they had no understanding
[31:58] themselves.
[32:01] Okay. So my purpose for teaching this
[32:04] was multiffold. Firstly, to help young
[32:07] people who are confused because they
[32:10] have no identity.
[32:12] Because you only have identity when you
[32:15] receive the Holy Ghost. That's when you
[32:17] know who you are. It is that spirit that
[32:21] gives you the ability to cry aba
[32:24] &gt;&gt; that knows who your father is. Right?
[32:27] And uh because they don't know whether
[32:30] they have the Holy Ghost or not, what
[32:31] true what it truly is and to know what
[32:34] purpose it must give them. In teaching
[32:37] the Bible, the Bible's language, I used
[32:40] it to point out that the English
[32:42] translators saw a reason in their time
[32:46] to make a distinction.
[32:49] Yes, I know. Brother Baron said they're
[32:51] the same word and they What does he mean
[32:54] by it's the same word? It's not a
[32:56] different person.
[32:59] &gt;&gt; But why do the English translators make
[33:01] a different word?
[33:04] Okay. Okay. So, for those and I'm
[33:08] putting this out
[33:10] to finally lay it down if you don't know
[33:12] what Holy Spirit is from this day,
[33:17] you've been told, okay,
[33:22] the denominational people,
[33:25] uh, I've actually got something in my
[33:27] head. I I I learned something from the
[33:28] good my good friends from Canada who
[33:30] said to me, "You say denominational, it
[33:33] should be denominational."
[33:35] I think they're right. I think I'm going
[33:37] to change how I say it, denominational.
[33:41] So anyway,
[33:44] um
[33:45] the denominational people
[33:49] believe and when they look at the Bible
[33:52] like are you also with me? Amen.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; There is one word in the Old Testament
[33:57] in Hebrew and it's ru
[34:00] u a c h if you want to uh spell it
[34:04] simply ru which is basically the word
[34:07] for spirit and you break that word down
[34:10] it's got to do with air breathe breath
[34:14] wind ru so in other words when you read
[34:18] in Genesis chapter 1 and you read in and
[34:21] it says and the spirit of God moved
[34:23] moved upon the waters. The word is
[34:26] ruach. The ru
[34:29] moved upon the waters. Now I want to ask
[34:31] you, was that the Holy Spirit or was
[34:34] that the father?
[34:37] And now this is where I have fun with
[34:39] message people.
[34:41] Was that the Holy Spirit or was that the
[34:43] father? Now, so I've studied this. I've
[34:45] taken it to pieces. Okay? I when I study
[34:49] something, I literally go through the
[34:50] whole Bible.
[34:53] And I'm telling you this, all the way
[34:56] from Genesis right up to Moses, which is
[35:00] not far in chapters. It's just Genesis
[35:02] to Exodus. But in time, it's over 2,000
[35:05] years,
[35:06] &gt;&gt; right? So from Genesis to Moses, you do
[35:10] not see the word holy.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; It's never called the Holy Spirit. It's
[35:15] called the spirit of God.
[35:18] same Hebrew word ruach.
[35:21] Why is holy introduced after Moses?
[35:26] Now there's your key.
[35:28] Now if if there was father, son, and
[35:31] holy ghost and they existed eternally
[35:33] for all time and holy spirit was the one
[35:36] brooding over the waters. And why are
[35:39] you being technical, brother? I'm not
[35:41] being technical. The writers of the
[35:43] Bible did this. Yes,
[35:45] &gt;&gt; they called him spirit of God or spirit
[35:49] or in Genesis 6, my spirit shall not
[35:51] always strive with man. Ruach.
[35:54] But when it comes to Moses for the first
[35:57] time, he says to Moses, take off your
[35:59] shoes from off your feet, for the ground
[36:01] where on you stand is holy. Then from
[36:04] there, he goes on, he says, you be ye
[36:07] holy as I am holy. You are called to be
[36:10] a holy people because I am a holy God.
[36:13] This is where the whole story of holy
[36:16] comes in.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; What is holy? Holy means set apart.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Why? Now for the first time, God is
[36:25] bringing a nation and a group of people
[36:27] to be set apart from others.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; And not set apart from others as in
[36:32] separated like a partate. It is
[36:34] separated as in set apart for his
[36:37] purpose.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Prior to that, man served
[36:41] God without church, without law, without
[36:44] scripture. There was no holiness.
[36:47] They were not called to a law, a
[36:50] sacrifice, a um a tradition of religion.
[36:54] They were not called to a code of
[36:55] dressing. They were not called to a
[36:57] certain type of worship. They were not
[36:59] called to a brazen altar. They were not
[37:01] holy.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; Therefore, it was not holy spirit. Amen.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; It was spirit of God. It's not me. It's
[37:12] the translators that did that. So when
[37:15] holiness
[37:16] came in, that means God brought in a way
[37:20] of worship. That is my holiness.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; Now you will have my spirit on you that
[37:28] will help you keep my holiness. That is
[37:32] holy spirit.
[37:35] same spirit of God. But now when it
[37:38] anoints Moses, when it anoints Aaron,
[37:40] when it anoints David, when David said,
[37:42] "Do not take your Holy Spirit from me."
[37:47] He was saying, "Do not take away the
[37:49] part that makes me set apart
[37:52] from all others to you."
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; That's what Holy Spirit means. This is
[37:58] what I'm saying. Most people do not
[37:59] understand this.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah. They they they stuck in
[38:03] trinitarianism that says it's a third
[38:06] person of trinity. Even if you're in the
[38:08] message and you're talking about the
[38:09] Holy Spirit and you don't know what it
[38:11] means
[38:13] right now, the English translators
[38:16] didn't stop there. So what changed when
[38:19] it's when it moved from just spirit of
[38:20] God to holy spirit? What changed?
[38:23] Dispensation
[38:25] &gt;&gt; manifestation,
[38:26] &gt;&gt; right? And up to Christ. I'm going to
[38:29] read a quote to you a little later to
[38:30] show you the transition from Christ.
[38:33] John the Baptist starts uh preaching
[38:36] about a change of dispensation of the
[38:38] spirit of God. Now the Bible is going to
[38:41] is going to say to you it's shifting.
[38:44] Right? So from from uh uh Moses now the
[38:48] words spirit of God and Holy Spirit are
[38:50] used in the Old Testament. Right? But
[38:53] now after Christ, you're going to hear
[38:56] Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit, and spirit of
[38:59] God. What changed? Dispensation and
[39:03] manifestation.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; But it's the same spirit.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; The same spirit that was on Adam. The
[39:09] same spirit that was with Noah. The same
[39:12] spirit that was it just the wording
[39:14] changed because of the manifestation.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; That's all we're saying. We're not
[39:20] saying it's another person or it's
[39:21] another we're we're talking about the
[39:23] change of manifestation and we're
[39:25] showing that the translators of the
[39:26] Bible identify that
[39:29] right
[39:32] you know
[39:34] I can do this exercise with you
[39:38] if you say okay I am traditional message
[39:41] if brother said that you should just not
[39:43] even say anything you should stick with
[39:45] that you should be bound by those two
[39:47] quotes and never get into anything else
[39:49] because do not do that. All right. So if
[39:52] so I'm saying to you let's take this
[39:54] exercise right? If you say Holy Spirit
[39:57] and Holy Ghost is exactly the same,
[39:59] there's no difference, the wording,
[40:02] right? Will you go to the Bible and swap
[40:06] the words up? Because the New
[40:09] International Version does that. It
[40:11] takes away the word Holy Ghost because
[40:12] the ghost started scaring the people in
[40:14] the last few hundred years. So they
[40:17] switched it out because ghost is like an
[40:19] apparition and they stuck in Holy Spirit
[40:22] where there should be Holy Ghost. Many
[40:24] of the Bibles do not have the word ghost
[40:26] anymore. It's all spirit. So I'm saying
[40:28] to you as traditional message uh
[40:32] religious people, will you go into the
[40:34] book of Ephesians 4:13 and say do not
[40:38] grieve the Holy Ghost by which you are
[40:40] sealed till the day of your redemption?
[40:43] Will you swap out the word Holy Spirit?
[40:45] Because the word there says Holy Spirit.
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Do not greet the Holy Spirit till the
[40:50] day of your redemption. Will you swap it
[40:52] out and put Holy Ghost in there? Are you
[40:53] okay with that? Does it even sound right
[40:56] to you? No, it doesn't. If you go and
[41:01] and read the message and everywhere
[41:02] brother in one sentence he will say by
[41:06] the same Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit does
[41:09] this. The same Holy Ghost there does did
[41:11] that the same the same Holy Spirit does
[41:13] this. Will you swap them and say they're
[41:16] the same? The moment you do that you
[41:19] change the thought
[41:21] &gt;&gt; that he is speaking.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; You cannot say they are just
[41:26] interchangeable at every time. They are
[41:28] speaking of a manifestation.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; That's the thing. They are speaking of a
[41:36] specific manifestation. You cannot also
[41:39] tell me that brother Brandham just
[41:40] willy-nilly he just uses Holy Ghost
[41:42] here, Holy Spirit there, Holy. No. He's
[41:45] speaking with the movement of the Holy
[41:46] Spirit. He's actually using those
[41:48] terminology purposefully.
[41:51] He's not just willy-nilly just saying
[41:53] things. Even so, in the Bible, right?
[42:00] So even with the uh translators that
[42:03] translated to English, they didn't just
[42:05] say, you know what, let's just use Holy
[42:07] Ghost here seven times and Holy Ghost,
[42:10] Holy Spirit here seven times and let's
[42:12] use 89 times in the old in the New
[42:14] Testament. Let's use the word Holy
[42:15] Ghost. Uh there's no difference. Let's
[42:18] just use it to have variety.
[42:21] Let's just use spirit of God. Yeah,
[42:24] there holy spirit there. Holy Ghost
[42:27] there. just so we can have some variety.
[42:30] No, those men were moved of the Holy
[42:33] Ghost to write it that way.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; They used it knowingly. They recognize a
[42:40] distinction between manifestations.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Right. Even if you read Bible
[42:46] dictionaries like maybe Strong's
[42:48] concordance, it's going to tell you that
[42:51] John the Baptist began to speak. I've
[42:54] read it there. That's why I'm telling
[42:55] you John the Baptist began to speak of a
[42:57] change of dispensation of the Holy
[42:59] Spirit.
[43:01] Okay. So also if we believe that the
[43:05] Holy Spirit in Do you believe the Holy
[43:07] Spirit inspired men to write the Bible?
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; You do that all the scriptures are
[43:13] divinely inspired?
[43:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; So if you believe that do you think that
[43:19] where they wrote Holy Spirit they made a
[43:21] mistake?
[43:22] Do you think that where they wrote Holy
[43:24] Ghost, they made a mistake? Do you think
[43:26] they they they wrote it there just to be
[43:30] um to have variety
[43:33] or was it purposeful? Well, of course,
[43:35] it's purposeful.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Right. So, if we believe that that is
[43:40] the way it was written, I want to tell
[43:42] you I find no fault in the way the Bible
[43:46] was translated.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Zero. I'm so sold out to my Bible and
[43:51] the message. I believe everything
[43:53] brother Ben Baron says. I know why he
[43:55] said that. In the day that he said that,
[43:58] those two quotes, I know why he said
[44:00] that. And yet I look at all the other
[44:03] thousands of quotes where he uses the
[44:04] words differently and I see ministers
[44:07] take them and confuse them and teach it
[44:09] falsely to the children.
[44:15] So if we believe that right to me the
[44:18] Bible is perfect as it is. I don't want
[44:20] to change anything. It is just us that
[44:24] makes the different interpretation by
[44:26] our private understandings. Are you with
[44:28] me?
[44:29] &gt;&gt; So when you read the scriptures,
[44:32] right? Holy Ghost and Holy Spirit is
[44:34] used in in if if if uh you know it's
[44:38] used in any Bible verse interchangeably
[44:42] uh but they are two different words.
[44:44] Does it really strike you as absolutely
[44:46] interchangeable and there's no
[44:48] significance when the word Holy Spirit
[44:50] is used s so many times? I mean if you
[44:54] just sit and think about it logically,
[44:56] Holy Spirit is used only seven times.
[45:00] Holy Ghost is used 89 times.
[45:04] You do not find significant numbers like
[45:07] that without purpose.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; All right. If you have become someone
[45:14] oblivious to the change in manifestation
[45:17] of the Holy Spirit like if you say
[45:18] there's no there's no difference right
[45:20] Holy Spirit from old testament to new
[45:22] testament it just changed you know they
[45:24] just decided to change it so right let's
[45:27] let's start with this are you with me
[45:29] &gt;&gt; amen
[45:30] &gt;&gt; why would brother Brandham say the
[45:32] following things let's go to the next
[45:34] quote okay
[45:36] uh question and answers on Hebrews
[45:40] where this go too.
[45:44] Yeah, that's the one. Question answers
[45:46] in Hebrews. Are you all with me?
[45:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Now he's reading. If you read Ephesians
[45:52] 4:30 right quick, you'll find out what
[45:55] the seal of the living God is. Ephesians
[45:57] 4:30. Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God,
[45:59] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[46:02] your redemption, not till the next
[46:04] revival, but got eternal security. Now
[46:06] those of you who heard the message I
[46:08] preached in North America when I said
[46:12] uh you are not sealed by the gifts
[46:16] &gt;&gt; till the day of your redemption. You are
[46:18] sealed by the person.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; That's what I was pointing to. Right? So
[46:22] you're sealed until the day of your
[46:24] redemption because how why because
[46:26] brother says you can have the gifts 24
[46:28] hours in a day and go to hell. How can
[46:30] the same man using it interchangeably
[46:34] say that you can have the Holy Ghost 24
[46:36] hours in a day and go to hell and then
[46:38] you are sealed by the Holy Ghost till
[46:40] the day of your redemption?
[46:42] &gt;&gt; That's a direct contradiction. They
[46:43] think the man is nuts.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Obviously, it's not a contradiction
[46:48] because he knows what he's saying,
[46:51] &gt;&gt; right? Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God
[46:53] whereby you are sealed until the day of
[46:54] your redemption. See if Ephesians 4:30
[46:56] doesn't say that. Then take your margin
[46:59] readings and run it all. In other words,
[47:00] look at your concordance. Run all the
[47:02] rest way through the scriptures there
[47:04] and find out. Sealed until the day of
[47:07] your redemption. In other words, he's
[47:09] telling you, go look in your margins and
[47:10] go go study the Bible.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Right? Okay. This is what I want to
[47:16] bring you to paragraph 51. Now,
[47:19] remember, the Holy Ghost was not taught
[47:22] as the baptism of the Holy Ghost until
[47:24] after World War I.
[47:31] The Holy Ghost was not taught as the
[47:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost until after
[47:36] World War I. He's literally telling us
[47:39] when the church
[47:41] changed the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[47:43] the gifts to be the person.
[47:47] He's telling you that happened after
[47:48] World War I. That never happened before.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; But I'm saying to you, these are the
[47:54] things I study. He's the one pointing me
[47:58] to this.
[47:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; How about the masterpiece?
[48:04] The masterpiece message. Brother Mike,
[48:06] can you move it for me? Notice here the
[48:08] life that was in the husk in the stalk
[48:10] and the tassel in the husk all gathers
[48:12] in the seed. The life was in the stalk
[48:14] went one went to make the other.
[48:16] Justification made a way for
[48:18] sanctification. Sanctification made a
[48:19] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[48:21] Are you ready for this? The baptism of
[48:23] the Holy Ghost made a way for the Holy
[48:25] Ghost itself
[48:27] &gt;&gt; to come. What is that now?
[48:30] &gt;&gt; To come right down in perfection. Now
[48:32] what is the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[48:34] itself? Back to the word again to
[48:38] manifest itself.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; So the baptism of the Holy Ghost was a
[48:42] different manifestation
[48:43] &gt;&gt; that makes way for the person to
[48:47] manifest the word itself.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. to manifest itself by the
[48:53] word.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[48:54] &gt;&gt; he says that.
[48:56] &gt;&gt; Let's read resume of the of the church
[48:59] ages.
[49:00] We learn the most amazing truth that the
[49:02] Holy Spirit could and would fall upon
[49:05] the unregenerate false vine Christians.
[49:08] Are you hearing?
[49:10] &gt;&gt; That the Holy Spirit would fall upon
[49:14] everyone.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Yes. unregenerate false vine Christians
[49:18] and manifest powerfully in various signs
[49:21] and wonders. Here's the issue. Message
[49:25] ministers today across the world are
[49:28] trying to take us back to that.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; When we already know the warning in
[49:33] scripture is that's what they're going
[49:36] to do in the false church.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Manifest powerfully in various signs and
[49:43] wonders. Even as Judas had a definite
[49:46] ministry in the Holy Ghost
[49:50] though now Judas wasn't there in the
[49:53] upper room.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; What is he talking about?
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost only came in the upper
[49:59] room, how was Judas in the ministry of
[50:02] the Holy Ghost?
[50:03] &gt;&gt; He himself was pronounced a devil.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:10] Now, what was Judas in the ministry of?
[50:12] The person or the gift
[50:17] and answers part three, paragraph 63.
[50:20] Now, if I taught it like that, people
[50:22] would reach out and get a hold of that
[50:24] without having what that that person's
[50:26] got. See? All right. Here it is. The
[50:29] Holy Ghost does speak with tongues, but
[50:32] you've got to have the Holy Ghost first
[50:34] before it can speak with tongues.
[50:39] Now you get it. And I bet you nobody
[50:42] did. If you reach out and get a hold of
[50:45] a gift of speaking in tonesues without
[50:47] Now if you if you know how the prophet
[50:49] speaks, he's saying if you get a reach
[50:52] out and get a a hold of speaking in
[50:54] tonesues without having the Holy Ghost
[50:56] first.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; What is he talking about?
[51:00] &gt;&gt; If you're speaking with tongues without
[51:02] having the person
[51:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. you have problems.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; In other words, it's very possible to
[51:11] speak in tongues without having the
[51:12] person
[51:14] &gt;&gt; because the gifts falls on the just and
[51:16] the unjust.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; But the person is given to the elect.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm talking about.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; I want our young people to desire the
[51:24] person.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; And then let the gifts follow.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; The way it's been taught is get the
[51:31] gifts and that's the person. Mhm.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Now remember that can be brother is
[51:39] saying that can be a genuine gift. I'm
[51:41] reading that could be the Holy Ghost
[51:43] speaking in you with unknown tongues and
[51:46] you'd be lost and go to hell.
[51:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible said so.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Now these are the thousands of quotes
[51:53] I'm talking about.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Right now. Now, now I'm telling you, if
[51:57] you if you say this, if you read this,
[52:00] how are you interpreting this as a young
[52:02] person who's coming up in the message?
[52:05] This is exactly what I get asked at
[52:07] youth camps, brother Alistister, how do
[52:09] I know I have the Holy Ghost? What does
[52:11] the Holy Ghost do for me? How is it a
[52:14] Why is it so necessary? Why are they
[52:15] shouting and screaming at us to get the
[52:17] Holy Ghost, but you could have the Holy
[52:19] Ghost and still go to hell?
[52:24] So says, "You believe that? Would you
[52:26] like to have scripture in that? You want
[52:28] scripture? Raise your hand. Though I
[52:29] speak with tongues of men and of angels,
[52:31] you know that. Uh though I have no
[52:33] charity, I am nothing." See, unless that
[52:36] goes with it, you can have this. You can
[52:38] have the gifts. You don't reach after
[52:40] that without this.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm asking you who are not in the
[52:46] service and reading it in books and
[52:48] listening to the tapes, do you know what
[52:49] he's saying? You can have this and don't
[52:53] reach after that without this. What is
[52:55] he saying?
[52:57] &gt;&gt; You need to know what he's saying.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "Get this first and that'll
[53:01] actually follow it."
[53:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:04] &gt;&gt; That's the right way to teach it. Get
[53:06] the person and then the gifts will
[53:08] follow.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Where the gifts are necessary.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; But what do they teach now in message
[53:15] camps? Shout, scream, faint
[53:19] emotions and you got it.
[53:22] &gt;&gt; And then you come back to the next camp.
[53:24] Repeat process.
[53:29] What did he mean? Get the Holy Ghost
[53:31] first before it can speak with tongues.
[53:33] Okay. The next quote from leadership.
[53:36] The choice of your conduct. You can mix
[53:38] it now. You're either for God or against
[53:40] God. And the outward expression shows
[53:42] exactly what's on the inside. the
[53:44] cockleber. Many of you think I got the
[53:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm going to
[53:48] heaven. That don't mean one thing.
[53:51] You're going to heaven. No sir.
[53:54] What is he saying people? If I have the
[53:56] Holy Ghost, why am I not going to
[53:57] heaven? Brother Alistister, what do you
[54:00] mean? What is he talking about? The
[54:01] gift, not the person.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; You can have the baptism of the Holy
[54:06] Ghost every hour in your life and still
[54:08] be lost and go to hell.
[54:13] But then he says future home paragraph
[54:17] 111 see the heart has to be cleansed.
[54:21] Now this is young people this is what I
[54:22] want this is what I want to get you to
[54:23] and we'll talk more about this at the
[54:25] end but the heart has to be cleansed
[54:28] like that he says before God can come
[54:31] down in the person of the Holy Ghost
[54:34] which is Christ coming down and dwell in
[54:37] the human heart.
[54:39] What is the person of the Holy Ghost is
[54:42] Christ coming down and dwelling in the
[54:44] human heart. This is not gifts.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Agreed. Okay. Fundamental foundation for
[54:51] the faith. Last quote there before we
[54:52] get moving on that Jesus had some power.
[54:56] Let's say it that way. Let's just say it
[54:58] that way. Jesus's redeemer to redeem us
[55:02] back to what we was before Adam's
[55:04] transgression when he was here on earth
[55:07] as an example son of God from the first
[55:11] indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
[55:15] Wake up. Don't miss it. This is the
[55:17] quote where brother Bram says that Jesus
[55:21] was the first example son of God who had
[55:24] the first indwelling
[55:27] of the Holy Spirit. Which means all
[55:30] those previous
[55:32] of the Old Testament had an anointing.
[55:36] &gt;&gt; They did not have the indwelling.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Christ had the indwelling and he was now
[55:41] going to bring sons like him. which
[55:43] means the dispensation was changing.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; It was not going to be the same. There
[55:51] was now going to be accompanied with
[55:53] gifts and indwelling.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; That means they were going to receive um
[55:58] maybe Peter already had some indwelling.
[56:01] Maybe John had some indwelling. Maybe
[56:04] the indwelling was going to take place
[56:05] at different stage. They but they would
[56:07] receive the gifts in Acts chapter 2 and
[56:09] they would receive an indwelling as
[56:11] compared with others.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; From the Old Testament who only had the
[56:18] anointing upon their lives.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; Other men were do you agree? He says
[56:26] this that he was the first indwelling of
[56:29] the Holy Spirit.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; First example son of God. Glory to God.
[56:33] You love him, saints.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; Now, knowing this, I put this already in
[56:40] our service, but I'm doing this again
[56:42] next uh scripture. Let's go to the
[56:44] scripture. John 7:39. Now, are you all
[56:47] with us? Let's let's break this down
[56:48] clearly. But this spake he of the spirit
[56:52] which they believe they that believe on
[56:54] him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[56:56] was not yet given. This is spoken in
[56:58] John 7:39.
[57:00] The Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[57:03] that Jesus was not yet glorified. That's
[57:06] telling you the ho like basically what
[57:08] it's saying is the Holy Ghost was going
[57:10] to be given after Jesus was glorified.
[57:13] When you say that and you say when was
[57:15] Jesus glorified, you say well he was
[57:17] glorified maybe after he rose again and
[57:21] and ascended. So the Holy Ghost was only
[57:24] given after that.
[57:27] Do you agree?
[57:30] Okay. So why did Jesus do this? John 20.
[57:36] And when he had said this, he breathed
[57:37] on them and said, "Receive you the Holy
[57:39] Ghost. Whosoever sins you remit, they
[57:41] are remitted unto them. And whosoever
[57:43] sins you retain, they are retained." Why
[57:46] did he also uh give the Holy Ghost to
[57:51] the 70 and send them off healing and
[57:53] casting out devils before Acts chapter
[57:56] 2?
[57:58] Why did Mary and Elizabeth, the Bible
[58:01] says, filled with the Holy Ghost? Mary
[58:03] filled with the Holy Ghost produced a
[58:05] child. Elizabeth filled with the Holy
[58:07] Ghost produced a child. Zecharias filled
[58:09] with the Holy Ghost before the Holy
[58:11] Ghost came.
[58:16] See, this is the reason our children and
[58:20] so many people are confused about
[58:22] whether they have the Holy Ghost or not.
[58:24] Because I and I began when I preached in
[58:27] America saying with the quote brother
[58:29] Baron says to to have the Holy Ghost you
[58:32] need to know what it is.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:34] &gt;&gt; What it is for your day.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; You need to know what results it brings.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; When it comes you have to believe that
[58:43] it's for you. So he says when you know
[58:46] what it is and you believe that it's for
[58:48] you and you know what results it is it
[58:51] brings then you know what you've got
[58:54] when you get it.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; That's the quote I use that as the
[58:58] foundation for what I preach there. This
[59:01] is the whole thing. This is the reason
[59:03] our children are being confused by all
[59:06] these conflicting ideas about what the
[59:09] Holy Ghost is, what the Holy Spirit is.
[59:12] and it's being slapped around as if you
[59:14] should just know what it is. Nobody
[59:16] tells them that holy means dedicated to
[59:21] the purpose of God.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; That holy means dedicated to what God
[59:26] has provided the provided way for
[59:28] worship for your day. And if you are
[59:31] holy, it means you are committed to that
[59:33] worship.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Instead, they speak about holy as if it
[59:38] is your life that must be clean. Brother
[59:41] man said you must be clean before you
[59:43] get it.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; You don't get clean by it.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Going to come to that for those of you
[59:53] who don't understand.
[59:57] Amen. So they are asking why the gift
[1:00:00] our children are asking why the gifts of
[1:00:02] tongues and prophecies have diminished.
[1:00:06] I was literally asked that question
[1:00:08] before I left here. before I left for
[1:00:10] the United States. Brother Al, why are
[1:00:12] the gifts and prophecies diminishing in
[1:00:14] the churches? Why do we not see them
[1:00:16] anymore in Message Churches? They are so
[1:00:18] much in Pentecostal churches. Why are we
[1:00:20] not seeing them? And some one of part of
[1:00:24] the question was in some churches they
[1:00:25] have almost disappeared and some people
[1:00:28] who are faithful believers are not even
[1:00:29] healed when they are prayed for.
[1:00:33] I got this question before I left for
[1:00:35] the United States.
[1:00:37] Don't sidetrack it. What excuse are you
[1:00:40] going to be given for some faithful
[1:00:42] brother has cancer and he's not healed
[1:00:45] of it and he dies? And most of the time
[1:00:48] the ones who are dying are those
[1:00:49] absolutely faithful faultless people.
[1:00:52] And people are asking but they were men
[1:00:54] of great faith. We prayed for them. They
[1:00:56] prayed. Why do they die?
[1:01:00] Don't sidetrack. You need to have an
[1:01:02] answer.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; And don't give confusing answers to the
[1:01:05] young people. They're watching you.
[1:01:08] So like I said to you before and I say
[1:01:12] to the young people and to my own
[1:01:14] children, you have to have a rock.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; You have to have a foundation.
[1:01:21] Right? When I said to you a few weeks
[1:01:22] ago, you have to have an anchor in your
[1:01:25] soul to go back to when things get hard
[1:01:27] to understand when you're reading the
[1:01:29] message and the scriptures. When you
[1:01:31] have problems with the scriptures on the
[1:01:33] Godhead, what is your rock?
[1:01:36] Your rock is there is only one God.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; That means no matter what you read, you
[1:01:42] must come back to there is one God.
[1:01:44] Amen.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; One Lord. You shall have no other god
[1:01:46] beside me. There's no three people.
[1:01:49] There's no one throne for the father and
[1:01:51] another throne for the son and sharing
[1:01:53] this. No, you your rock must be there is
[1:01:55] one god. That means when you read the
[1:01:57] scripture and he said uh and Jesus
[1:02:00] prayed to the father, you come back to
[1:02:02] this rock.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Don't make it two. Remember one god.
[1:02:06] Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; You have to have a rock. Settle that
[1:02:09] rock and everything else fits into it.
[1:02:11] Right. So when you look at the issue of
[1:02:13] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit. What
[1:02:15] is the Holy Spirit and why should there
[1:02:17] be any contention about it? Do you even
[1:02:19] know what it is? Is the father a spirit?
[1:02:23] Yes. Brother Baron said God the father
[1:02:25] is a spirit. He said God uh the son is a
[1:02:28] man who the spirit of God dwelt in.
[1:02:32] That's a literal quote. He said we all
[1:02:34] know that.
[1:02:35] He also said
[1:02:38] the father is the holy spirit. They are
[1:02:41] the self same thing. And he also said
[1:02:44] the holy ghost is Jesus's father.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; Quote
[1:02:55] twice. Said it twice.
[1:02:58] This is what I'm saying to you. If you
[1:02:59] don't teach this right, your children
[1:03:02] are going to be thoroughly confused.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah,
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; if they're the same. Holy Father is a
[1:03:08] spirit. Holy Spirit is a spirit. And you
[1:03:10] just stop there. They are spirits. Let's
[1:03:13] all blow balloons and have a party.
[1:03:15] They're spirits.
[1:03:17] No. What is a holy spirit?
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And that means it's related to man. It's
[1:03:24] given to man so he could be holy. Holy
[1:03:27] means set apart for the purpose of God.
[1:03:30] Yes,
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; it's very different to the spirit that
[1:03:32] existed through all space and time
[1:03:35] before everything. It's a different
[1:03:37] manifestation of the same person.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; But you must know, you don't just say
[1:03:43] one is the spirit, the other spirit is
[1:03:44] the same thing.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; That's delusional.
[1:03:48] Okay. So, why not just call the Holy
[1:03:50] Spirit the father if they're the same
[1:03:52] thing? If they're interchangeable. If
[1:03:54] brother said there's a self same thing,
[1:03:56] why not just call the holy spirit the
[1:03:57] father? Why make a distinction?
[1:04:02] What is your rock on this? If you don't
[1:04:03] know this, what is the point of arguing
[1:04:05] this? Right? What the what the Holy
[1:04:08] Ghost is and what the Holy Spirit is.
[1:04:09] Okay, I want to come to this part.
[1:04:11] Evidence.
[1:04:12] So, here's the other thing. There's this
[1:04:14] whole argument about evidence, the
[1:04:16] evidence of the Holy Ghost. The evidence
[1:04:17] of the Holy Ghost. You must have the
[1:04:19] evidence. You must have That is
[1:04:21] nonsense.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Okay? If you have if you need evidence
[1:04:26] to know that you're a believer, you
[1:04:28] missed the boat.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; I don't need evidence. I am a believer.
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; The fact that I believe is my evidence.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; I don't need signs or some other kind of
[1:04:38] thing to tell me who I am. I am a
[1:04:40] believer. That's where it starts.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; My soul is sold out to him. My soul
[1:04:45] loves him with all of its being, with
[1:04:47] all of its essence. That's what I know.
[1:04:50] I don't need signs, wonders, or anything
[1:04:52] to confirm that to me.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; So what then is the Holy Ghost an
[1:04:58] evidence of?
[1:05:01] Right. Let's read.
[1:05:04] This will shock you out of your boots
[1:05:07] if you're wearing them.
[1:05:10] There it is. Peran church age. You can't
[1:05:14] claim that manifestation is the evidence
[1:05:18] of being spiritborn or spiritfilled.
[1:05:24] No sir, I will admit that true
[1:05:28] manifestation is the evidence of the
[1:05:31] Holy Spirit doing mighty acts, but it is
[1:05:35] not the evidence of the individual being
[1:05:38] spiritfilled.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:42] Even though that individual has an
[1:05:45] abundance of those manifestations,
[1:05:49] the evidence, some of you who have
[1:05:51] concentration problems, trust me, I'm
[1:05:53] going to explain it to you now. The
[1:05:56] evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:05:58] today is just the same as it was in the
[1:06:00] days of our Lord. Reading on, he says it
[1:06:03] is, what is the evidence? If there is,
[1:06:05] it is receiving the word of truth for
[1:06:08] the day in which you live. That's what I
[1:06:10] have.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; I receive it gladly. I believe it 100%.
[1:06:15] There isn't a fraction of resentment in
[1:06:18] me towards the word of God preached by
[1:06:20] the messenger throughout the Bible or
[1:06:22] anything the history. I love it so much.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; Right. Jesus reading on he says Jesus
[1:06:31] never did stress the importance of the
[1:06:33] works
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; as he did the word. Amen.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; He knew that if the people got the word
[1:06:43] the works would follow.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; That is Bible. Okay. So for those who
[1:06:49] lost concentration in that first part,
[1:06:51] I'm going to explain this to you. He's
[1:06:53] saying the gifts of the Holy Ghost are
[1:06:56] for vindicating the word,
[1:06:59] not to you.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; It's not to vindicate to you that you
[1:07:04] are a believer. So I'm saying to you
[1:07:06] young people, that's not the proof. If
[1:07:08] you go to youth camps and they make you
[1:07:10] shout, scream, fall on the floor, and
[1:07:12] act good actors like you fainted and the
[1:07:15] Holy Spirit came and they fan the
[1:07:16] flames, fan the flames, fan the flames,
[1:07:19] the heat,
[1:07:21] and then you you fall down and you have
[1:07:23] some vibration and epileptic fit and you
[1:07:27] act like the Holy Spirit hit you. When
[1:07:29] you get up again, you better live your
[1:07:32] life so clean. Otherwise, I'm coming
[1:07:34] after you.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Because if you claim that's your
[1:07:37] experience, you're in trouble,
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; right? But that isn't
[1:07:44] that is an anointing. That anointing,
[1:07:46] brother said, can happen. We know it. We
[1:07:49] see it here in Africa. You got a bunch
[1:07:51] of people marching through the streets.
[1:07:54] Uh they're all shouting the same thing
[1:07:56] in Zulu and they're shouting against
[1:07:58] some kind of of a political party or
[1:08:02] they shouting kill the farmer, kill the
[1:08:04] bur, whatever it is and they're moving
[1:08:07] and they're all in lock step. That's
[1:08:09] exactly like a church.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:11] &gt;&gt; They're focused. They've got someone
[1:08:13] telling them the word. What is the word?
[1:08:15] We hate the government.
[1:08:17] Hate this party. Hate. Right. They've
[1:08:19] got that. It's being repeated to them
[1:08:21] and they're singing and they're moving
[1:08:23] and they're singing and they're moving.
[1:08:25] Normally, if they do that for two
[1:08:26] minutes, it's okay. They Okay, let's go
[1:08:28] home. But if you do that for half an
[1:08:31] hour,
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; and add dehydration and heat
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; and fatigue,
[1:08:39] it goes into a spiritual state.
[1:08:43] Something else takes over. Another
[1:08:45] spirit takes over. one or two of them or
[1:08:48] more go into a trance. They get so
[1:08:51] inspired by this constant repetition and
[1:08:55] this beat and this drumming and this
[1:08:57] motion and emotion. They start jumping
[1:09:00] and screaming and spinning and shouting.
[1:09:01] And I'm looking at this and I'm thinking
[1:09:03] that's exactly what I see in a
[1:09:04] Pentecostal church
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; after they stretch it for too long. That
[1:09:09] will happen to any human who has red
[1:09:11] blood and gray cells in his brain box.
[1:09:16] Why? You can do that.
[1:09:19] You can do that. You know what I'd love
[1:09:21] to see in all these fantastic churches
[1:09:23] all over the world? Take away all their
[1:09:25] music. Take away their drums, bass,
[1:09:27] guitar, piano, organ. Sing without it.
[1:09:29] And let's see how much spirit you got.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; You're flat. You got nothing.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:09:38] that's what it is. What? Something
[1:09:40] creating your anointing. you you know
[1:09:42] you got somebody speaking there on the
[1:09:44] speaker and you hear the drums going
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; and a keyboard doing something. What do
[1:09:50] you think that's doing to impressionable
[1:09:52] young people and you're telling them
[1:09:54] that's the Holy Ghost?
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; That's gifts of music working up their
[1:10:00] tender spirits to fall prey to emotions
[1:10:03] and sensations.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; We know it. We see it here in Africa.
[1:10:08] You can't fool us with it.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:14] It happens at every political rally
[1:10:16] here. They literally lose their minds.
[1:10:18] They'll be going through our streets
[1:10:19] here in Durban. The next thing you know,
[1:10:21] some of the zealots just think, "Oh, I
[1:10:24] love MMA so much. Take a break. Throw it
[1:10:26] in the window.
[1:10:29] Feels so good. Windows broken." Another
[1:10:32] guy said, "Wow's broken. Let's go in and
[1:10:33] take something."
[1:10:38] Yes, that is an anointing.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; that's what anointings do.
[1:10:44] &gt;&gt; And then you'll have the people coming
[1:10:45] up on the TV screen and say there were a
[1:10:48] few rascals there. They do not represent
[1:10:51] the party.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; You riled them up.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; You gave them the anointing. You made
[1:10:57] them do that. They do not represent us.
[1:11:00] We do not stand for violence. Of course,
[1:11:03] you stand for violence. You riled them
[1:11:06] up. You You made the slogans. You sang
[1:11:09] the songs. You made them jump. You made
[1:11:11] them stand in the heat. You made them
[1:11:13] gathered together. You know what
[1:11:15] happens? Take one person from
[1:11:17] Pentecostal church, leave him all by
[1:11:19] himself in a building and get the spirit
[1:11:21] now. That's it. Come on, let's go get
[1:11:24] the spirit. No, but when you got a group
[1:11:26] of people together and we're
[1:11:28] shoulderto-shoulder and we're moving in
[1:11:30] lock step and we're moving in lock step
[1:11:32] and then suddenly I'm feeling good
[1:11:34] because you're with me, you're with me,
[1:11:36] we're together, we're in this, we're
[1:11:37] soldiers, we're ready to fight. Let the
[1:11:39] enemy come. Take all of them out and
[1:11:42] leave you by yourself. You're like
[1:11:47] one shadow and you're like,
[1:11:50] what happened to the soldier who was
[1:11:52] going to take out the enemy? Yeah,
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; I've seen it. I grew up in it. I know
[1:11:57] the Pentecostal church. I was lifted up
[1:12:00] on a bed by a demon-possessed girl
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; when I was 4 years old. I've seen all
[1:12:04] this stuff already. I've seen the people
[1:12:07] speak with tongues and have all the
[1:12:08] miracles. You want to take us back to
[1:12:10] that
[1:12:17] confusion?
[1:12:19] See, that's what it brings. One is a
[1:12:22] visible manifestation to vindicate the
[1:12:24] word and the other is the person that
[1:12:27] brings the purpose.
[1:12:30] Mary, Elizabeth and Zachariah were
[1:12:31] filled with the Holy Ghost and brought
[1:12:33] forth purpose. Mary, Elizabeth, and and
[1:12:36] Zechariah did not speak with tongues or
[1:12:38] prophesy.
[1:12:40] &gt;&gt; They brought forth babies and fulfilled
[1:12:42] that the Messiah confirmed that the
[1:12:44] Messiah was there.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; They did not act like Acts chapter 2,
[1:12:49] but they were filled with the Holy
[1:12:50] Ghost. The Bible says,
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; There's a difference. See, I accept that
[1:12:56] the Holy Ghost in that in that section
[1:12:58] is speaking of the person
[1:13:01] bringing a specific ability that has to
[1:13:03] do with purpose. On the other side, it
[1:13:05] was the vindication of the word. What
[1:13:08] was Acts chapter 2? To vindicate. In
[1:13:11] other words, Peter, James, John, all
[1:13:13] these men of the disciples, they were
[1:13:15] coming out and going to the world and
[1:13:16] they were going to say, "Jesus of
[1:13:18] Nazareth came in our day. He's the
[1:13:21] savior of all all the world. He died and
[1:13:24] rose again." And the Gentiles are
[1:13:26] saying, "Oh, yeah. Prove it."
[1:13:29] What? You don't have a scripture? You
[1:13:32] don't have other holy men. So, do you
[1:13:34] see what those gifts were for? To prove
[1:13:37] their message that had no proof.
[1:13:40] Acts chapter 2 was supposed to be the
[1:13:42] vindication of a message when they had
[1:13:45] no proof.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; But for the individual,
[1:13:49] they had to have the person to produce
[1:13:51] their own individual purpose.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; The gifts over the church is not for
[1:13:56] you. It's for another person.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:59] Why would if somebody spoke in tongues
[1:14:01] here in our church today and a prophecy
[1:14:04] came most likely that occurred because
[1:14:06] somebody here is new or was not
[1:14:09] believing
[1:14:10] and that came to vindicate the word to
[1:14:13] that person. That's why the gifts are
[1:14:15] necessary.
[1:14:17] But if you got everybody in the church a
[1:14:20] seasoned believer, the elect of God, the
[1:14:23] bride of Christ, married to the word,
[1:14:25] what do we need to vindicate the word
[1:14:26] for?
[1:14:28] You each have the vindication within
[1:14:31] yourself.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; You have the person within yourself
[1:14:33] directing you to the truth.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; So the confusion I want to tell you
[1:14:38] there will always be confusion on what
[1:14:40] the prophet said on many things. If
[1:14:42] there's no confusion on before 63 and
[1:14:44] after 63, confusion on the seventh seal
[1:14:47] being opened or not, confusion on Daniel
[1:14:50] 70 weeks, whether it's 7 years or
[1:14:51] whether it's three and a half years.
[1:14:53] There's always confusion.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; I'm to answer the question on brother
[1:14:56] Al. How do we navigate through this
[1:14:58] without causing confusion? Sorry, can't
[1:15:01] help you there. You need revelation on
[1:15:03] the word. There are confusing things all
[1:15:06] over the message.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; confusion occurs because of lack of
[1:15:10] revelation.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; lack of understanding. The prophet said
[1:15:14] that many people don't receive the Holy
[1:15:17] Ghost because of lack of teaching.
[1:15:21] And yeah,
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; you remember he said, he said, "You
[1:15:25] old-timers remember before I get a
[1:15:27] person baptized, I teach them so that
[1:15:30] when they are baptized, they receive the
[1:15:31] Holy Ghost." He said, "A lot of people
[1:15:33] come, they get baptized and don't
[1:15:34] receive the Holy Ghost." Why? Because
[1:15:36] they were not sufficiently taught.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; So by focusing on the confusion of the
[1:15:43] things he said, the prophet uses the ch
[1:15:45] the phrases Holy Spirit, Holy Ghost
[1:15:47] interchangeably. If our conclusion is
[1:15:50] the phrases are just the same, then you
[1:15:52] are not being taught right. So I'm going
[1:15:54] to spell it out for you. Are you all
[1:15:57] ready for this?
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:16:00] When the prophet says you are sealed by
[1:16:02] the Holy Ghost or the Holy Spirit, he
[1:16:05] used it interchangeably till the day of
[1:16:07] your redemption. He is not talking about
[1:16:09] the anointing.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the person,
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; the indwelling. When he says you can
[1:16:15] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[1:16:17] the Holy Spirit and still be lost or the
[1:16:20] Holy Spirit and still be lost, he is not
[1:16:22] talking about the person.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; He's talking about the anointing. When
[1:16:25] he says you can speak in tonesues and
[1:16:27] not have the Holy Ghost, he says that in
[1:16:30] trying to do God a service. You can
[1:16:31] speak in tonesues and not have the Holy
[1:16:34] Ghost. He means you do not have the
[1:16:36] person of the Holy Ghost.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; That's all we are saying, right? in and
[1:16:41] and that brings us to the most important
[1:16:44] thing when he says the Holy Spirit or
[1:16:47] the Holy Ghost is the dynamics.
[1:16:50] Is it the anointing or the person?
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; This is what's being pushed today.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; What is the dynamics that puts life to
[1:16:59] the mechanics? We know this. This came
[1:17:01] from the seventh under seven virtues
[1:17:03] movement. It's already been tried and
[1:17:05] failed.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. They teach the exact
[1:17:09] same thing that men are resurrecting
[1:17:11] today.
[1:17:13] Tried and failed. What happened? We saw
[1:17:16] it. They went hallelujah. Praise. There
[1:17:19] isn't even a single church in America
[1:17:22] with all their noise that comes close to
[1:17:25] the seven virtues movement here in South
[1:17:28] Africa.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; When they are shouting and screaming in
[1:17:31] the church, you cannot hear yourself
[1:17:33] think.
[1:17:35] That's how much the more you tell them
[1:17:37] about anointing, it's so loud. They're
[1:17:40] standing here in front. You're
[1:17:42] preaching. They're standing in front
[1:17:43] waving their arms in your face, shouting
[1:17:45] amen, screaming, running, jumping all
[1:17:48] over the place. They did it. And what
[1:17:49] happened to the churches? They fell.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Very badly in immoralities.
[1:17:57] Terrible.
[1:17:59] Why? You've got passion and zeal out of
[1:18:02] control. no wisdom. They fell.
[1:18:09] Young people went astray. You literally
[1:18:11] cannot get young people anymore to even
[1:18:13] qualify for elders to be pastors,
[1:18:16] preachers, deacons because they messed
[1:18:18] up their life so bad in the same
[1:18:21] movement.
[1:18:24] Whatever you are being taught is going
[1:18:26] to determine your experience and your
[1:18:28] victory.
[1:18:30] Right? This is why I care so much about
[1:18:33] it because I'm concerned for our young
[1:18:36] people. I'm concerned for our people. I
[1:18:38] don't want you to be misled.
[1:18:41] I mean, what does it matter what I want?
[1:18:44] To me, I feel like it's the Holy Spirit
[1:18:46] in me that wants that.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter what my brain thinks.
[1:18:50] I am moved to to say these things.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. The seven thunders, seven virtues
[1:18:55] movement taught that it was the
[1:18:57] anointing that brings shouting, charisma
[1:19:00] and atmosphere. And they flogged that
[1:19:02] horse till it died.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; So if it isn't then what is it? If you
[1:19:11] are not clear on what it is when the
[1:19:13] prophet speaks of it of it, how it is
[1:19:15] spoken of in the Bible, then you are
[1:19:17] going to remain in a state of ignorance
[1:19:19] and forever you will lack identity. If
[1:19:22] you don't know what the Holy Spirit is,
[1:19:24] what the Holy Ghost is, if you don't
[1:19:26] know what it is, if you don't know what
[1:19:28] results it brings, if you don't believe
[1:19:29] it's for you, you will lack identity.
[1:19:32] Young people, forever in the message,
[1:19:34] you will just be a piece of driftwood
[1:19:36] drifting through churches having no
[1:19:38] power in you whatsoever.
[1:19:42] Let's go to question two.
[1:19:47] because you said and I quote, so this is
[1:19:50] I'm reading the question, the word is
[1:19:52] what your soul is married to, but this
[1:19:54] animal meaning the body needs the
[1:19:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So I just
[1:19:59] want to point out this is somebody
[1:20:01] giving me an actual quote that I spoke
[1:20:03] of in the message while I preach. So I'm
[1:20:06] glad this is because I want people to
[1:20:08] see I am not against the baptism of the
[1:20:10] Holy Ghost. I believe in it. I believe
[1:20:13] you need gifts.
[1:20:15] I believe you need power. Baptism of the
[1:20:18] Holy Ghost is power for purpose.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Ability which you did not have before.
[1:20:24] Right? So I said this animal needs the
[1:20:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I mean in
[1:20:29] order to live a purposeful life. So this
[1:20:32] person, this young person is saying I
[1:20:34] believe without a shadow of doubt that
[1:20:35] my soul is married to I love to hear
[1:20:38] this. I love to hear things like this
[1:20:40] from young people. I believe that
[1:20:42] without a shadow of doubt that my soul
[1:20:43] is married to the word which also would
[1:20:45] make me believe that I have received the
[1:20:48] person of the Holy Ghost because I have
[1:20:50] received the open book. That's what I
[1:20:52] want to hear, right? But the question,
[1:20:55] can a person receive the person of the
[1:20:57] Holy Ghost before the baptism of the
[1:20:59] Holy Ghost?
[1:21:01] See, that's why I love question and
[1:21:02] answers.
[1:21:03] This is a wonderful sincere question and
[1:21:05] I think it's amazing that young people
[1:21:07] can ask such questions while adults are
[1:21:09] still stumbling over themselves.
[1:21:12] To answer this question simply but not
[1:21:14] to make a doctrine out of it. I will say
[1:21:16] look at the types and the things the
[1:21:18] prophet said. He said you must believe
[1:21:21] first before you receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:23] Because Paul asked the question, have
[1:21:25] you received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:21:27] believed? He made the statement because
[1:21:30] many people were manifesting gifts in
[1:21:32] the Leodysian Pentecostal age and yet
[1:21:35] not believing in the word of the
[1:21:36] prophet. They had gifts. They were they
[1:21:39] were preaching. They were speaking with
[1:21:40] tongues. They were prophesying but they
[1:21:41] were rejecting the prophet's message.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; So I believe that what has happened
[1:21:46] after Pentecost is that God flipped it
[1:21:49] around.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the bride had to remain in
[1:21:52] a barren state. You had to receive the
[1:21:55] seed first. So before Pentecost was
[1:21:59] receiving the rain, gifts, gifts, gifts,
[1:22:01] gifts, and then God had to bring them to
[1:22:03] to the prophet's message. Now we got the
[1:22:05] prophet's message first
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; and then the ability follows.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Then the work follows. We remained in
[1:22:12] the state of barrenness while the seed
[1:22:14] was being planted and the womb was being
[1:22:16] opened. The womb was being opened by the
[1:22:18] word being revealed.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; So we received the person first. We were
[1:22:22] married to him first and then the
[1:22:25] ability falls. And the ability is
[1:22:27] specific.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; So that was a private affair. This and
[1:22:32] and you can put it all in with the word
[1:22:35] coming to us, opening up our womb,
[1:22:37] making us fertile, taking away the
[1:22:40] baroness is what? Not a public show.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; It is the third pull coming to sons.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Nobody knows what it is. Nobody can
[1:22:50] identify. Nobody can tell you. You've
[1:22:52] got the Holy Ghost. You've got the Holy
[1:22:53] Ghost. This is the Holy Ghost. Nobody
[1:22:54] can tell you. It's not a public affair.
[1:22:58] So different to Pentecost.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; So then according to Revelations
[1:23:04] 10:8-11, look look at the process there.
[1:23:07] And I like this because this is what the
[1:23:09] the the the the young person is asked.
[1:23:12] If you look at Revelations 10:8-11, what
[1:23:14] is it? Take the book first, eat the
[1:23:17] book, then prophesy.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Right? In Pentecost was prophesy first,
[1:23:22] then search for the book somewhere.
[1:23:25] Right? Look at the process. Eat the
[1:23:28] book. Digest it. It will be sweet in
[1:23:31] your mouth, bitter in your belly. Now go
[1:23:33] and prophesy.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; There it is. Get the person. Go to the
[1:23:37] angel uh who who has the book in his
[1:23:40] hand. Take the book. There it is. Right.
[1:23:43] Brother literally spoke like he was
[1:23:45] speaking to different people in his
[1:23:47] ministry. On the one hand, he would tell
[1:23:48] people, "Clean up your lives and make
[1:23:50] sure you live right and keep the law of
[1:23:52] the word." And then on the other hand,
[1:23:54] he will say to another group of people,
[1:23:55] don't worry about that. Just believe the
[1:23:57] word and those things will sort them
[1:23:59] out.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; What is important to understand is that
[1:24:04] the human body is a beast
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; that comes by sexual desire. It does not
[1:24:10] have natural abil. In other words, your
[1:24:12] body is saints, young people, your body
[1:24:15] naturally does not want to keep the
[1:24:17] word.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; It wants to feed its face.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; Right. It wants to feed its own lust and
[1:24:23] its own desires. Your body is selfish.
[1:24:25] It wants to do its own thing. It does
[1:24:27] not want have a desire to be holy. Holy
[1:24:31] means to follow the word.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; But when you receive the Holy Spirit,
[1:24:36] then you get that movement inside to
[1:24:39] say, I want to be different.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; I want to follow the word. I want to
[1:24:42] worship this way. I want to be at this
[1:24:44] church. I want to be at uh in this place
[1:24:47] in my life. You cannot do that without
[1:24:49] the gift of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what is in the soul is the
[1:24:54] person of the Holy Ghost. God gives the
[1:24:57] body ability by the baptism. But what is
[1:25:00] in the soul is the person.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; In the past uh they receive the word not
[1:25:06] in its fullness. So when they believe
[1:25:08] the fullness of the word uh when we
[1:25:11] believe the fullness of the word we
[1:25:12] receive the fullness of the person. In
[1:25:15] the past in Luther's day he received the
[1:25:18] person with measure.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Luther received the person with
[1:25:22] measure. He still had major gifts,
[1:25:25] right?
[1:25:28] You know, come to think of it, before I
[1:25:30] left for the states, my little boy was
[1:25:32] asking me, so and I'm just thinking I we
[1:25:37] got message ministers here asking us to
[1:25:39] repeat the first the the the first age.
[1:25:42] They want to take us back to the
[1:25:44] apostolic age. Actually, I know all the
[1:25:47] quotes, right? Brother Ram said, "Every
[1:25:48] age is an apostolic age." I get that.
[1:25:50] You know what I'm talking about. They
[1:25:52] want to take us back to the book of Acts
[1:25:54] and they want us to go back there and
[1:25:56] they they keep saying we but I say to
[1:25:58] them there's a whole lot more that to
[1:25:59] the book of Acts than just shouting,
[1:26:02] jumping around, screaming, speaking with
[1:26:03] tongues and prophesying. There's a whole
[1:26:05] lot. Your church must change. Don't go
[1:26:07] take tithes like you do. Then split all
[1:26:09] the stuff.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Spread it out. You want to go back to
[1:26:12] the book of Acts? Let's do it the way it
[1:26:14] was. Brother M says the book of Acts had
[1:26:17] so many errors. The church had so many
[1:26:19] errors and those errors were going to be
[1:26:21] amplified through the church ages until
[1:26:23] it reached complete blackout.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Why do we want to go back to the church
[1:26:26] there which had so many errors? And
[1:26:28] we're the bride. We're not going back to
[1:26:30] church.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Right. So, what I'm saying to you is in
[1:26:36] Luther's day, he had that much word and
[1:26:39] he had person the person that he had in
[1:26:42] himself was according to was
[1:26:44] proportional to the amount of word that
[1:26:46] he had.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Yes. So he had the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:50] Ghost. He had the person, but he was
[1:26:52] also a trinitarian, a German who loved
[1:26:54] his beer and smoked a pipe.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; You try that today.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; You can't do that today when you have
[1:27:01] the fullness of the word.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then we have a scripture that
[1:27:06] tells us that without us they cannot be
[1:27:08] made perfect.
[1:27:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Having the fullness of the person then
[1:27:13] brings abilities to the body. We have to
[1:27:16] reflect maturity and purpose. It will
[1:27:18] not be the same in the ages past when
[1:27:20] people did not possess the fullness of
[1:27:22] the word. And here's the thing. You have
[1:27:24] a scripture that tells you that when
[1:27:26] that which is perfect is come, that
[1:27:27] which in part is done away with.
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:35] That's literally telling you once you
[1:27:37] have the full person and you are married
[1:27:39] to the person, you are not dependent
[1:27:41] upon gifts to vindicate the word for
[1:27:44] your day.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; Not that you are not going to have
[1:27:48] gifts. You are going to have gifts in
[1:27:50] its season for a particular purpose.
[1:27:53] You're not going to be running around
[1:27:55] rampant with gifts just randomly
[1:27:57] expressing themselves. Okay.
[1:28:01] Question three.
[1:28:03] Can you have the Holy Spirit on the
[1:28:05] body, spirit and soul? This is a complex
[1:28:08] question. Once again, you really need to
[1:28:10] understand what Holy Spirit is. Uh, and
[1:28:14] because it's it's complicated because of
[1:28:16] how people interpret Holy Spirit,
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; right? So, if you say Holy Spirit is the
[1:28:22] same as Holy Ghost is the same as
[1:28:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost, you can only
[1:28:25] have the baptism on the body and the
[1:28:27] spirit.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit, the person is for the
[1:28:31] soul.
[1:28:32] Just like we were saying as we close off
[1:28:34] the last question, the body is an animal
[1:28:36] and the animal requires ability. The
[1:28:38] Holy Ghost anointing gives ability to
[1:28:40] the body and the spirit because the body
[1:28:41] and the spirit has senses,
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; has emotions. It's subject to sensation.
[1:28:46] It needs ability. But the soul is not
[1:28:49] emotions. It's not sensations. Right?
[1:28:52] The person of the Holy Ghost is received
[1:28:54] in the soul. Remember in Ezekiel 36
[1:28:57] where it says, "I will give you a new
[1:28:58] spirit." Yes,
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; that's a new nature. That's your spirit
[1:29:02] being changed by the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:04] Ghost makes you a better person, a more
[1:29:07] likable person, a person that is more
[1:29:10] committed to the the worship of God.
[1:29:12] That's what it's doing for you. But then
[1:29:13] he says, I will give you my spirit.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; And I will put my spirit within you. And
[1:29:20] this is specific. It doesn't say I will
[1:29:22] put my spirit within you and make you
[1:29:24] prophesy and do great deeds and and and
[1:29:26] and um heal people and do great miracles
[1:29:30] in the world. No, it says I will put my
[1:29:32] spirit in you that you will keep my
[1:29:34] commandments
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; and follow my ways.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; That's the person.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; That's what you want, young people.
[1:29:43] That is the person of the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:45] Just a quote to verify that. I don't
[1:29:48] like doing this but you know notice now
[1:29:52] women they want to have bobbed hair they
[1:29:54] will wear shorts paint makeup these
[1:29:56] little bikinis and things they that's
[1:29:58] not important they were wear nowadays
[1:30:00] they want to do it and yet they want to
[1:30:01] go to church you see that anointing upon
[1:30:04] the spirit not upon the soul
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; means people in other words he's telling
[1:30:11] you you are dressing out of character
[1:30:14] because it's not in your soul
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; but you're you think you're proving to
[1:30:18] yourself you got an anointing on the
[1:30:20] body and the spirit but you but not in
[1:30:22] the soul. See the soul has to have the
[1:30:26] person.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go to question four as
[1:30:31] we close.
[1:30:33] So I love this. This is the question
[1:30:36] where it all comes out in the open.
[1:30:39] Okay. In the youth meetings you said
[1:30:42] holy ghost meetings are not going to cut
[1:30:44] it. So, who are these youth services
[1:30:48] meant to help? I think that that meant
[1:30:50] the youth services I preach in Canada.
[1:30:52] Who are they meant to help? Are they
[1:30:54] meant to help youth without the Holy
[1:30:56] Spirit or youth with the Holy Spirit?
[1:31:00] Fascinating question because youth with
[1:31:03] the Holy Spirit, what does that tell
[1:31:05] you? If if you hear this the phrase
[1:31:08] youth with the Holy Spirit, what does
[1:31:09] that tell you? What do you think of
[1:31:11] anybody?
[1:31:13] What do you think of youth who got their
[1:31:15] lives together? Youth who are living
[1:31:17] straight? Youth who who have no sexual
[1:31:20] problems. They have no problems with
[1:31:22] lust. They're just mute, immune, and
[1:31:25] sexually dead.
[1:31:30] Youth with the Holy Spirit, they've got
[1:31:31] themselves in control, man. Right? What
[1:31:35] are we saying? I'm just putting it to
[1:31:37] you in a in a very humor humoristic way
[1:31:40] so that we can break it down further.
[1:31:42] But this is true. This is a good
[1:31:44] question. Who are these youth services
[1:31:46] meant to help? Youth with the Holy
[1:31:48] Spirit or youth without the Holy Spirit?
[1:31:50] I like the question because further on
[1:31:52] the next part of it says, are you saying
[1:31:55] that these young people who struggle
[1:31:57] with fornication
[1:31:59] that is any legal sexual act as you put
[1:32:02] it don't have the Holy Spirit? If that's
[1:32:05] the case, why not teach getting the Holy
[1:32:07] Spirit as the answer? That's a good
[1:32:10] question. Are you saying even with the
[1:32:12] new birth people can have these
[1:32:14] struggles?
[1:32:15] Answer is yes.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; I wasn't clear on that. As you can
[1:32:21] imagine, we are caught between these. So
[1:32:23] here this brother is he's from North
[1:32:25] America. He's telling me that we are
[1:32:28] caught between two groups. One says just
[1:32:31] get the Holy Spirit versus you need more
[1:32:33] than just getting the Holy Spirit.
[1:32:36] Okay, see that this is a beautiful
[1:32:39] question or a set of questions which I
[1:32:42] know comes I know the person comes from
[1:32:44] a good heart of concern a wonderful
[1:32:46] young man in today's churches we are
[1:32:49] concerned about the condition of our
[1:32:50] young people we see them going to youth
[1:32:53] meetings now this is why I have preached
[1:32:55] it the way I've preached it and why I
[1:32:57] wanted to bring a distinction
[1:33:01] between the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:03] and the Holy Spirit and what results
[1:33:06] they bring. You've got to know
[1:33:08] carefully. You can have the baptism of
[1:33:10] the Holy Ghost and still go to hell.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; But if you have the person, you're
[1:33:14] elect.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Right. Is that the word? Is that what
[1:33:19] we've been through?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; So, what I want for our young people is
[1:33:22] to get the person.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; And I know if they get the person, they
[1:33:27] get the baptism.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:30] No.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Right now, I'm going to tell you, here's
[1:33:34] what happens at youth meetings
[1:33:36] worldwide.
[1:33:39] Youth go to meetings. They go to
[1:33:41] conventions. They go to camps. They go
[1:33:43] through motions of being called. Every
[1:33:46] single youth meeting and and and camp,
[1:33:48] there is an altar call. You know what's
[1:33:50] an altter call? They call you to the
[1:33:53] front. They ask you to repent. They ask
[1:33:54] you to make your life right. Whole bunch
[1:33:56] of old ministers with big bellies come
[1:33:58] out and pray for you.
[1:34:01] and pass on their gifts of whatever it
[1:34:03] is to you and pray for you and shake the
[1:34:05] living daylights out of you and then you
[1:34:08] leave that place with emotions thinking
[1:34:11] I got saved
[1:34:13] you know I had a feeling I had a
[1:34:15] sensation now I'm not saying that some
[1:34:17] people are not saved at that time but
[1:34:21] many people feel they have an experience
[1:34:24] right and they seem as if they are
[1:34:26] repenting crying going through emotions
[1:34:29] confessing ing their wrongs, rejoicing
[1:34:31] with deliverance, but then they come
[1:34:33] back the next year, repeat.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Next youth meeting, repeat. Many are
[1:34:39] disillusioned and defeated, not knowing
[1:34:42] what to make of their experience. And
[1:34:44] then you've got youth who are sitting
[1:34:46] there who have the person
[1:34:50] feeling bad, being made to feel bad,
[1:34:53] like they are not going to the front.
[1:34:56] They are they are being told you are
[1:34:58] unworthy. You have stuff in your life.
[1:35:00] You can't deal with it. You need to be
[1:35:02] here. If you're not here, if you missed
[1:35:04] the Holy Ghost call right now, you're
[1:35:06] going to be lost. Am I right, young
[1:35:07] people? Yeah. That's exactly what
[1:35:09] happens. Many are disillusioned and
[1:35:12] defeated not knowing what to make of
[1:35:14] their experience and simply do not know
[1:35:16] whether they have the Holy Ghost or not.
[1:35:18] They are living in a state of constant
[1:35:21] confusion. I I've opened myself up to
[1:35:25] questions from everywhere, right? And it
[1:35:28] all comes back. There are so many
[1:35:31] ministers who think everything's great,
[1:35:35] everything's fantastic. The youth, the
[1:35:37] youth are literally bluffing you in that
[1:35:41] they don't want to talk to you because
[1:35:42] they know you're going to make them
[1:35:44] repeat.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Right? Let me explain to you what
[1:35:48] happens, right? Let's read future home.
[1:35:51] This is the quote we read before but I
[1:35:53] want to bring you back to before I
[1:35:55] highlighted the middle portion. Now I'm
[1:35:56] highlighting this part. Brother said the
[1:35:59] heart has to be cleansed like that
[1:36:01] before God can come down in the person
[1:36:03] of the Holy Ghost which is Christ coming
[1:36:05] down and dwell in the human heart. It
[1:36:07] must be repented. It must be baptized in
[1:36:10] water in his name to show what it
[1:36:12] belongs to. Right here it is.
[1:36:15] Young people,
[1:36:17] if you're going to show a commitment to
[1:36:19] God, you got to clean up your act.
[1:36:23] And it doesn't take supernatural to
[1:36:25] clean it up. It takes responsibility.
[1:36:29] Clean up your act.
[1:36:31] Stop doing that. How must I do it? Just
[1:36:34] stop it.
[1:36:36] If I tell you stop standing, what do you
[1:36:38] do? You sit down. It's that simple. No,
[1:36:42] but it's so hard. you know, I'm going to
[1:36:43] Yeah, it's so hard cuz you still want to
[1:36:45] do it.
[1:36:47] Do stuff. Show commitment. Clean up your
[1:36:50] act. Come to church. Read your Bible.
[1:36:54] Become active in the church. Show some
[1:36:57] uh uh commitment. Clean up your act.
[1:37:00] That doesn't need revelation.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; Dressing right does not need revelation.
[1:37:06] Speaking right does not need revelation.
[1:37:08] Not having a weird hairstyle does not
[1:37:10] need revelation.
[1:37:15] You don't need a baptism of the Holy
[1:37:17] Ghost to make you do all that. You can
[1:37:18] do that without the baptism of the Holy
[1:37:20] Ghost.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; What has been happening to young people
[1:37:24] at what they call Holy Ghost meetings is
[1:37:27] that they are introduced to the
[1:37:29] anointing by charismatic preaching.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Right? And I'm going to explain to you
[1:37:35] the effects. I just told you what
[1:37:37] happens here in Africa with we have we
[1:37:40] have anointing in abundance.
[1:37:45] We don't have finances in abundance.
[1:37:48] We have anointing in abundance.
[1:37:50] Everywhere you go there is an anointed
[1:37:52] church. I mean
[1:37:55] it's miracles. It's signs, wonders,
[1:37:57] dreams, visions. It's it's Corinthians
[1:38:00] on steroids.
[1:38:02] That's what we have in Africa and in
[1:38:04] message churches in Africa. Okay. The
[1:38:08] anointing, listen carefully, affects the
[1:38:11] senses
[1:38:12] and can cause you to feel sorry for the
[1:38:15] things you've done. Okay? If a if a
[1:38:18] charismatic preacher comes here and he's
[1:38:20] preaching about Christ and the blood and
[1:38:23] salvation and the wrongs that you do and
[1:38:26] he doesn't have much notes, but he's
[1:38:28] laboring on that repetition. Repetition,
[1:38:32] repetition. And he goes on for an hour,
[1:38:34] an hour and a half. He's badgering the
[1:38:37] spirit and crushing it and badgering it.
[1:38:40] And your little spirit inside is
[1:38:43] crumbling.
[1:38:44] Crumbling. It's taking a hit. It's
[1:38:46] taking a hit. With a person who loves
[1:38:49] the word, it's going to work. With a
[1:38:52] person who's still fragile, it's going
[1:38:55] to crush them.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; And here's what happened. you if you're
[1:38:59] a normal person and you got struggles in
[1:39:02] your life, there be sexual issues,
[1:39:05] lustful desires, whatever, you are going
[1:39:07] to feel sorry.
[1:39:09] No normal person will sit there and
[1:39:11] think, "Yeah, well, I'm just going to do
[1:39:12] what I got to do. I don't care what you
[1:39:14] say.
[1:39:15] Normal person is going to feel sorry.
[1:39:17] You're going to bow your head. It's
[1:39:18] going to show in your body. You're going
[1:39:20] to put your hands together. You're going
[1:39:21] to sit like that. You're going to you're
[1:39:23] going to take on a very nervous posture.
[1:39:25] You're going to be putting your head
[1:39:26] down. Your face is going to look like
[1:39:27] this. And you're going to be doing this
[1:39:31] and you're going to be saying sincerely,
[1:39:34] Lord, help me. Please forgive me for
[1:39:36] what I did last week. I really want to
[1:39:38] change. Lord, this is what's going to
[1:39:39] happen. You are naturally going to feel
[1:39:41] sorry for the things you've done, right?
[1:39:45] And that's why they keep coming back
[1:39:48] from experience to experience, but no
[1:39:50] repentance.
[1:39:52] What is repentance? Repentance is not
[1:39:55] feeling sorry for yourself.
[1:39:58] Repentance is having a change of mind.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; Now, here's the reason why our elders
[1:40:08] keep doing this and this is what is in
[1:40:11] the question the brother has asked me.
[1:40:14] Shouldn't we preach the Holy Spirit as a
[1:40:17] solution?
[1:40:19] Why do our elders from the previous
[1:40:20] generation keep doing that? Because our
[1:40:24] elders came from the world.
[1:40:27] They came from
[1:40:29] messed up sexual lives. They were
[1:40:31] drinkers. They were drug addicts. They
[1:40:33] were smokers. They swore the worst
[1:40:35] language. They dressed in shorts and
[1:40:38] tank tops and naked running on the
[1:40:40] beach. They did all that. They were in
[1:40:43] pubs and clubs and parties and script
[1:40:46] joints and you name it. Our elders did
[1:40:49] it. And they came to the message and
[1:40:52] they transformed
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; from that to this
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; right and they saw it work for them. The
[1:41:02] Holy Ghost smashed it.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Smashed their lives. They cut out from
[1:41:07] it. They dressed themselves up. They
[1:41:08] shaved themselves. They cleaned
[1:41:10] themselves. They put on the right
[1:41:12] hairstyle. They put on the right
[1:41:13] clothes. They came into the presence
[1:41:15] sanctified and ready to be filled. and
[1:41:18] they received it.
[1:41:20] What's the difference? All your young
[1:41:23] people have not experienced that.
[1:41:28] They are brought up in the message. They
[1:41:31] live under holy atmosphere. They live
[1:41:33] under correct teaching. They live being
[1:41:37] brought up straight. They live with
[1:41:40] godly parents. They are not brought up
[1:41:42] with worldly music in the home, with
[1:41:44] television, with horrible dressing. They
[1:41:47] are brought up. They are literally
[1:41:49] perfect little children.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Now you want them to have an experience
[1:41:54] you had.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; What do you want them to repent from?
[1:42:00] They actually already believe the word.
[1:42:04] They're not like you. You came from
[1:42:05] Methodist Catholic. You've got to undo
[1:42:08] Trinity. They don't have to undo
[1:42:09] Trinity. They don't have to undo abuse
[1:42:13] of the Holy Ghost by Pentecost. They
[1:42:15] don't have to undo Lutheranism. They
[1:42:17] don't have to undo Episcopalianism. They
[1:42:20] don't have to undo anything of that.
[1:42:21] What do you want them to repent from?
[1:42:24] Or repent from your lustful ways or
[1:42:27] repent from your bad thoughts.
[1:42:30] You know what that does? That's telling
[1:42:32] the youth, you ministers, do not have
[1:42:34] lustful thoughts.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; You walk around like you don't enjoy
[1:42:38] sex. You're a liar.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:44] You walk around like you don't have any
[1:42:46] bad thoughts. So these young people who
[1:42:49] are there, you want them to repent from
[1:42:52] what? Change their minds from what?
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; These young people brought up in the
[1:42:57] message need
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; repentance from self-righteousness
[1:43:04] of having lived a message life already
[1:43:07] and failing by it because they're
[1:43:10] active.
[1:43:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the That's what you need to
[1:43:14] be preaching to them. But you want to
[1:43:16] talk about wrongs that they did.
[1:43:20] And you're teaching them wrong things.
[1:43:23] I'm going to prove it to you.
[1:43:25] They are already believing. They have
[1:43:28] never been a part of denominations or
[1:43:30] believed in false doctrines. They grow
[1:43:32] up believing the prophet. They know
[1:43:34] nobody else but the prophet. If
[1:43:37] repentance is a change of mind, what
[1:43:39] change of mind do you expect them to
[1:43:41] have?
[1:43:42] What the elders don't understand is that
[1:43:45] they are living under this environment
[1:43:46] of the message from the time you are a
[1:43:48] child makes. Now listen to this. If you
[1:43:52] are living under the environment of the
[1:43:54] perfect the perfect word, the perfect
[1:43:57] anointing, the perfect church, the
[1:44:00] perfect people, do you realize every
[1:44:03] single wrong thought you have is a
[1:44:05] transgression as high as the highest
[1:44:07] building in the world.
[1:44:10] You never went through that.
[1:44:14] At Holy Ghost meetings, it's preached in
[1:44:16] a way that brings condemnation.
[1:44:19] So after they feel like they have
[1:44:21] received the Holy Ghost because they
[1:44:23] went through a sensation, they go back
[1:44:25] home. Glory to God. I've been
[1:44:28] transformed. I've been changed. I felt
[1:44:30] it in the meeting. I I cried my heart
[1:44:33] out. They laid hands on me. I feel so
[1:44:35] good. It's a sensation.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. They go back home. They fall again.
[1:44:41] They become disoriented and
[1:44:43] disillusioned. Now after falling, after
[1:44:47] the experience, what has happened in the
[1:44:49] experience? They had been told after
[1:44:51] receiving the Holy Ghost, if they fell
[1:44:53] again willfully,
[1:44:55] they are lost.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; So why would they want to confess again
[1:44:59] after they fell? Yeah.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Instead, we have a whole lot of use of
[1:45:05] loose living with struggles, unable to
[1:45:08] help themselves and unable to find the
[1:45:10] victory. What has happened is many of
[1:45:12] them have become good actors and they
[1:45:15] just do it to please their parents and
[1:45:17] their elders in church while they're
[1:45:18] living a double life. What happened?
[1:45:21] They left the youth meeting. They
[1:45:23] brought in front by the minister to give
[1:45:25] a testimony. This person has received
[1:45:27] the Holy Ghost. We've baptized them.
[1:45:29] They submitted their lives to the Lord
[1:45:30] Jesus Christ. The parents are beaming
[1:45:33] like they got a scroll in the ward.
[1:45:36] The parents testify and cry, "Mom, I'm
[1:45:38] so happy my child has been saved." The
[1:45:41] child is watching all this. 2 weeks
[1:45:43] later, the child is stuck in pornography
[1:45:46] again.
[1:45:47] Now the child after all that testimony,
[1:45:50] the pomp and grandeur in church, the
[1:45:53] display in church, do you think that
[1:45:55] child's ever going to confess again?
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; No. And this is what happened because
[1:45:59] these children talk to me.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; they literally said, "Brother Allah,
[1:46:06] I've crossed the line. I cannot talk to
[1:46:09] my parents. I cannot talk to my pastor.
[1:46:10] I'm in trouble. What do I do? What do I
[1:46:14] do?"
[1:46:18] They've been told after receiving the
[1:46:20] Holy Ghost, if they fall willfully,
[1:46:22] they're lost. So all this is because of
[1:46:25] lack of solid teaching and lack of this
[1:46:27] is why when I preach at brother Duncan's
[1:46:29] place I I read the quotes of brother
[1:46:31] said as long as he's calling out to you
[1:46:33] and you feel the the need in you you
[1:46:36] haven't lost your salvation you've lost
[1:46:38] the joy of your salvation.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Look at the contrast of how brother Bham
[1:46:44] teaches this under a Holy Ghost
[1:46:46] dispensation as compared with message
[1:46:48] churches and what they're doing today.
[1:46:50] Let's read church and its condition.
[1:46:53] That's what's the matter. People don't
[1:46:55] receive the Holy Ghost when they're
[1:46:56] baptized. They just don't thoroughly
[1:46:58] repent. Young people, we need to
[1:47:01] thoroughly repent. You if you you need
[1:47:04] to come to God and know, Lord, I've been
[1:47:06] an actor. I have godly parents. I've
[1:47:09] been living this life, but I don't know
[1:47:11] what what's going on. I don't know the
[1:47:13] difference between anything. I've been
[1:47:16] listening to the word. I've been
[1:47:17] enjoying the motions, but I want a
[1:47:19] committed life.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; That's what I want.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; That's where you ought to be, right? But
[1:47:26] look what's happen. He says, "You need
[1:47:27] to thoroughly repent."
[1:47:30] Listen, saints. He says, "God's trying
[1:47:33] to give them the Holy Ghost." What does
[1:47:36] he want? He wants you to be meek and
[1:47:38] gentle and quiet.
[1:47:44] That's not jumping, shouting, screaming.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; He wants you to be meek and gentle and
[1:47:50] quiet. He wants to give them the Holy
[1:47:52] Ghost. What does he want to give them?
[1:47:54] Not the gifts, the person.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:58] &gt;&gt; That's the reason you get up with that
[1:48:01] same selfishness in your heart. He says,
[1:48:04] "Or you might get up." Now, here's what
[1:48:05] I'm telling you. Here's what he's
[1:48:07] telling you. Sorry. shouting, speaking
[1:48:10] in tongues, or anything that wouldn't
[1:48:12] make you have the Holy Ghost. You've got
[1:48:14] to get up there a different person. You
[1:48:18] got to get up there gentle, quiet, meek,
[1:48:21] humble, God's spirit dwelling with you.
[1:48:25] Next year, you look down the trail and
[1:48:27] see how far you've come. See, you're
[1:48:30] gaining ground all the time.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Spirit. Yes.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; This idea of motion after emotion and
[1:48:37] sensation after sensation, camp to camp,
[1:48:40] meeting to meeting. Listen, young
[1:48:42] people, you only have 5 to 10 years of
[1:48:45] being a young person. Bad news.
[1:48:49] After you're a certain age and you're
[1:48:51] married, no more youth camps. From there
[1:48:53] on, you're struggling with the same
[1:48:55] things while you are married and no
[1:48:58] longer a youth.
[1:49:02] The Holy Spirit is love, joy, peace,
[1:49:06] longsuffering, meekness, gentleness,
[1:49:08] patience, faith.
[1:49:10] Why don't they teach that?
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; I was having a chat, Brother Chad, and I
[1:49:15] I like what he said. He said, "Nobody
[1:49:18] preaches the other gifts of the Holy
[1:49:20] Ghost like wisdom and knowledge."
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:23] &gt;&gt; Like saying, "We want to see those
[1:49:24] gifts."
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; And he's right. You never hear that.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Why? because they themselves, those
[1:49:31] ministries don't even have the wisdom
[1:49:33] and knowledge to pass it on to the young
[1:49:35] people. They ask them a question and
[1:49:37] they say, "Get the Holy Ghost."
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham did not encourage
[1:49:44] rowdiness and sensations to receive the
[1:49:46] Holy Ghost. One of the one of the most
[1:49:49] telling things in the Bible and the
[1:49:51] message is did you ever hear brother
[1:49:54] Bham act like that?
[1:49:57] Do you ever see Jesus act like that?
[1:50:01] Like what this acting that goes on here
[1:50:04] in Africa in the churches, you do not
[1:50:06] see that in the message.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; And think the the pillar of fire was in
[1:50:11] the in those meetings.
[1:50:13] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; Those with the pillar of fire in those
[1:50:16] meetings, they didn't act like what you
[1:50:17] see happening.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Now what? We have something greater
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; than the pillar of fire. You've got
[1:50:25] brother so and so
[1:50:27] who's got a voice that can make the
[1:50:29] building tremble.
[1:50:34] I'm sorry I can't stand it anymore.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; This begs the question, how do you teach
[1:50:39] young people who have grown up in the
[1:50:41] message to repent? What must they repent
[1:50:44] from? If repentance is a change of mind,
[1:50:47] what change of mind are you talking
[1:50:49] about? The elders of the past thought
[1:50:51] repentance was confessing wrongs like
[1:50:54] unrighteous things. These children
[1:50:56] believe the word. They dress right. They
[1:50:58] listen to the right ministry. They sing
[1:51:00] the right songs. They are obedient
[1:51:02] because they are not being taught how to
[1:51:04] receive the Holy Spirit under the
[1:51:06] dispensation. They are falling to
[1:51:07] unrighteous living and immorality. And
[1:51:10] this is confusing the elders. The elders
[1:51:12] are doing everything they know that
[1:51:14] worked for them and it's not working.
[1:51:19] That's right.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; Just because some youth bluff you, stay
[1:51:22] in your youth camp, stay in your youth
[1:51:23] meetings, eventually find someone to
[1:51:25] marry, get married, have a job, come to
[1:51:27] church and support you, doesn't mean you
[1:51:30] had the victory.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; They're still living double lives.
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; It is a big cause.
[1:51:38] The elders only know how they were they
[1:51:41] repented with a first and second pole
[1:51:43] ministry. Yeah,
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; the elders don't know what it is to
[1:51:46] repent under a third pole ministry.
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; That's the problem.
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; We know.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; We grew up under it.
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; That's where I came in from.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; I repented under a thirdpool ministry. I
[1:52:01] know what it takes.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; See, so they feel that it's going to
[1:52:06] work again for the children and that
[1:52:07] these young people will be brought to
[1:52:09] repentance by first and second pole.
[1:52:11] They believe they must go back to that
[1:52:12] process because they believe
[1:52:13] justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:52:15] of the Holy Ghost that makes way for the
[1:52:16] person. So let's go back. In other
[1:52:18] words, you message people have a creed.
[1:52:21] Correct?
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; First and second ministries are not
[1:52:26] going to bring young people to
[1:52:28] repentance today.
[1:52:30] They need to be brought to the open
[1:52:32] book.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; They need to be brought to the love of
[1:52:35] the word. You preaching like
[1:52:37] Pentecostals is not making them love the
[1:52:40] word. It's making them love religion and
[1:52:43] love church.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; They they will have uh if you bring them
[1:52:47] to the open book, they will feel
[1:52:49] freedom. They will not feel caged. They
[1:52:52] will not feel restricted. They will be
[1:52:53] an adopted son. They will have victory.
[1:52:56] They will have the power to take control
[1:52:57] of their own vessels. They will receive
[1:53:00] the ability of the Holy Ghost to achieve
[1:53:03] particular purpose in their life.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; In other words, they need to be taught
[1:53:08] right. They need to be taught love of
[1:53:10] the word in a bright age. No, they're
[1:53:13] not in an age where there's a little bit
[1:53:14] of light. We're not in Leodosia. The
[1:53:16] light is shining bright.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; It's so bright it exposes us when we
[1:53:22] don't even know it.
[1:53:27] That's where our young people are. Not
[1:53:29] the love of church or anointing from a
[1:53:30] previous age. Spiritual amnesia.
[1:53:33] We're almost done. This is the last
[1:53:35] quote and we close.
[1:53:37] You that wants the Holy Spirit, you want
[1:53:39] that. You want You that wants that
[1:53:41] experience, not an emotional excitement.
[1:53:45] You want the Holy Ghost, the life, the
[1:53:48] germ of life inside you. And you want to
[1:53:50] get rid of that amnesia that's making
[1:53:52] you can't identify yourself. You don't
[1:53:57] know where you stand. You don't know
[1:53:58] what you are. Let's get rid of it right
[1:54:01] now. There is a new birth here for you.
[1:54:04] a real genuine new birth. All right?
[1:54:09] We cannot make them feel that if they
[1:54:11] get the Holy Ghost for today, they will
[1:54:13] be perfect and never make mistakes.
[1:54:15] That's a lie.
[1:54:17] That's a problem. That's what they're
[1:54:20] selling. You you these young people have
[1:54:23] young people problems.
[1:54:26] Young people problems primarily has to
[1:54:29] do with sexuality.
[1:54:31] The moment you bash their thing, they're
[1:54:33] done for.
[1:54:35] There's literally some young people
[1:54:37] saying it's a sin. We are not allowed to
[1:54:40] like it.
[1:54:42] I went to I spoke to a minister. This is
[1:54:45] amazing. Minister told me, "Brother
[1:54:47] Alistister, you need to come and speak
[1:54:48] to our people. I'm having a serious
[1:54:50] problem." He says, "I married two young
[1:54:52] people and they went on their honeymoon
[1:54:55] and they came back and they did not
[1:54:56] consummate the marriage." And he asked
[1:54:58] them, "What's the problem?" He says,
[1:55:00] "Well, the first night we sat on our bed
[1:55:02] and we prayed, Lord, we are about to
[1:55:04] partake of the sin of the Garden of
[1:55:05] Eden. Please forgive us."
[1:55:10] And their bodies couldn't function.
[1:55:13] How did they become so deluded? There
[1:55:16] are literally young people who believe
[1:55:18] that sexuality is sinful. It's not the
[1:55:21] original way. It's not the perfect will
[1:55:23] of God. We we must actually become so
[1:55:26] dead to it and that's when we'll be
[1:55:28] perfect.
[1:55:31] The Bible proves that wrong.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; Did Moses have the Holy Spirit?
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Prophet like unto Moses. Christ is
[1:55:44] called prophet like Moses had the Holy
[1:55:46] Spirit. He had the anointing of God on
[1:55:49] him and God wanted to kill him.
[1:55:53] Abraham
[1:55:56] was anointed with the spirit of God and
[1:55:58] lied to save his own life.
[1:56:03] Where do I stand, Lord?
[1:56:06] Oh, Saul had the spirit of God upon him.
[1:56:09] Most people remember Saul for all the
[1:56:12] troubles he gave David.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; Go and read the chapters before David
[1:56:16] comes in the scene and see how great
[1:56:18] Saul was. You literally have verses
[1:56:21] where it said the spirit of God was upon
[1:56:23] Saul.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; There's it ru
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Holy Spirit was upon Saul
[1:56:31] and Saul did great things. He and Samuel
[1:56:34] I can't imagine. You can imagine this
[1:56:36] this terribly tall Benjamite with his
[1:56:39] massive sword and shield and and armor
[1:56:41] and this this gayhead prophet standing
[1:56:43] next to him with a wind blowing and
[1:56:45] theatrical music playing standing there
[1:56:47] taken out of Malachites. What a great
[1:56:50] movie that'll make. Hey, what I'm saying
[1:56:54] to can you imagine with the spirit of
[1:56:56] God how great go read it Saul's stories
[1:57:00] he was he had the spirit of God on him
[1:57:03] and then he became the man who had demon
[1:57:06] spurts on him.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; The Bible says Balam had the spirit of
[1:57:14] God on him when he prophesied.
[1:57:18] Balam was a false prophet
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; with a true gift.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; Okay. Sexuality.
[1:57:28] H. Was the spirit of God upon Samson
[1:57:32] while he was sleeping with a Philistine
[1:57:34] prostitute?
[1:57:39] Yes.
[1:57:41] The spirit only left him when he cut his
[1:57:43] hair.
[1:57:46] You mean the Holy Spirit? Yes. Was on
[1:57:49] Samson while he was having an affair. He
[1:57:52] was supposed to be married to another
[1:57:54] Philistine, which he shouldn't have been
[1:57:56] doing. And then that Holy Spirit got on
[1:57:58] Samson and he went and killed people,
[1:58:00] stole their coats, and burnt people's
[1:58:02] fields.
[1:58:06] How about us?
[1:58:08] You're teaching people that the Holy
[1:58:10] Spirit is going to take away all desire
[1:58:13] for sexuality,
[1:58:15] that you're going to be faultless after
[1:58:18] you get the Holy Ghost,
[1:58:22] that you are never going to be a person
[1:58:24] who will ever have any desire for your
[1:58:27] wife or your husband. Is the Holy Ghost
[1:58:29] going to make you numb and take it all
[1:58:31] away? No, my friend. You're going to
[1:58:35] struggle with that till the day you go
[1:58:36] in the rapture
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; in a translation. Yeah,
[1:58:41] the Holy Spirit, I'm sorry, is not a
[1:58:43] quick fix for all those things. They, if
[1:58:45] they told you that, they lied to you.
[1:58:50] Samson had the spirit of God on him
[1:58:52] while he was in the bed of a Philistine
[1:58:55] harlot.
[1:58:59] I could go on and on all through the
[1:59:02] Bible. So what is the Holy Spirit about?
[1:59:04] It's about the purpose of God being
[1:59:06] fulfilled.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; It doesn't care about who you are. It's
[1:59:10] going to use you, your faults, your
[1:59:12] mistakes, your issues. It's as long as
[1:59:14] you've got that person, you are going to
[1:59:16] keep moving on. You're going to have
[1:59:18] struggles. You're going to have
[1:59:19] backslideness. You're going to fall.
[1:59:21] You're going to wake up. You're going to
[1:59:22] fall. You're going to wake up. But if
[1:59:24] you don't have the word, you're lost.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; You can have anointings. You can bluff
[1:59:30] yourself that you keep in rules. You can
[1:59:32] bluff yourself all you want to and say
[1:59:34] you're clean. And the ministers who do
[1:59:36] that, shame on you for making those
[1:59:40] young people believe that you're just
[1:59:41] some sinless person without any faults,
[1:59:44] without any feelings, without any
[1:59:45] desires or lust or anything to make them
[1:59:48] feel like you're that great person and
[1:59:50] they are diminished before your eyes.
[1:59:52] You should never preach the gospel that
[1:59:54] way. Brother Brandham did not do that.
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:58] There is a difference between having the
[2:00:00] spirit of God upon you and having the
[2:00:02] spirit of God within you. Ultimately,
[2:00:05] the third pull ministry in this message
[2:00:07] has come to put the spirit of God in his
[2:00:10] people. In his people. We're not
[2:00:12] interested in God above us anymore. God
[2:00:14] with us anymore. We want God within us.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; That's what I want. Something inside me,
[2:00:22] not something just upon me. I don't
[2:00:24] mind. Something upon me will help me
[2:00:26] since I'm really bad times. I'll admit,
[2:00:29] but God within me is going to make me
[2:00:32] endure to the end.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; So to answer the question, when we teach
[2:00:36] the mystery, those meetings I had in
[2:00:39] brother Don's place, the mystery of
[2:00:41] sexuality to our children, we're telling
[2:00:43] them the truth.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; You are a biological animal. You are
[2:00:48] facing trials. You are facing problems
[2:00:50] in your life. You are going to struggle
[2:00:52] with this all the way through. After you
[2:00:54] get the Holy Ghost, after you baptize,
[2:00:56] after you committed yourselves to the
[2:00:58] word, you need power of the word to get
[2:01:02] personal victory.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; We're teaching them the power of the
[2:01:06] word. We want them to come to love the
[2:01:09] word. We're not teaching them if you
[2:01:12] stay in church, if you get the
[2:01:13] anointing, you'll be safe. That you
[2:01:16] fell. You see, you know why you fell?
[2:01:18] Cuz you left the church. You know why
[2:01:19] you fell? Because no, you fell before
[2:01:21] you left the church.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; See, we're not teaching them to depend
[2:01:29] upon an anointing to keep them safe. We
[2:01:32] are not teaching them abstinence as a
[2:01:34] form of strength. We are teaching them
[2:01:37] that true strength is knowing your
[2:01:39] weakness and knowing what you face in
[2:01:42] this world and understanding that it is
[2:01:44] the character of the word that saves
[2:01:47] you. A church without
[2:01:51] power without character is
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; but power with character.
[2:02:00] I I want character
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; and then if the power comes to me that
[2:02:04] power is under control.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not teaching the Holy Ghost
[2:02:09] as a solution to your problems. We are
[2:02:12] teaching the Holy Spirit as being the
[2:02:14] love of your lives.
[2:02:16] You should love the Holy Spirit.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; What is the Holy Spirit? The spirit of
[2:02:23] God in me that directs me to worship him
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; in the way it has been revealed for this
[2:02:30] day.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; There's the That's what the Holy Spirit
[2:02:33] is. If I don't have the Holy Spirit,
[2:02:35] then I want to go to college. I want to
[2:02:36] go to university. I want to go
[2:02:38] somewhere. I want to follow my
[2:02:39] ambitions. I don't care about the people
[2:02:41] of God. I don't care about what I do. I
[2:02:43] don't care if I live irresponsibly. I'm
[2:02:45] not interested in what they think about
[2:02:46] the message. I'm not interested in
[2:02:48] embarrassing my parents. That shows you
[2:02:50] don't have the Holy Spirit.
[2:02:52] But a child who has the Holy Spirit and
[2:02:55] is going through similar struggles and
[2:02:57] still comes back, that shows me he has
[2:03:00] the Holy Spirit.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; I can work with him. He loves the word.
[2:03:04] He'll come back to me. Brother L, I have
[2:03:06] this question. I have this question.
[2:03:08] Please explain this to me in the word.
[2:03:10] That's already telling me this boy has
[2:03:12] the Holy Spirit. This girl has the Holy
[2:03:14] Spirit.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; Why? Because they have been channeled to
[2:03:18] holiness to set apartness.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; There are plenty of of those who you
[2:03:26] know use in the message with ability.
[2:03:30] They worship
[2:03:32] plenty of youth in the message with
[2:03:34] ability.
[2:03:36] Okay? If there's one thing about our
[2:03:38] youth in the message, they have ability.
[2:03:41] They can sing like angels.
[2:03:43] They have musical talent. They can read
[2:03:47] the message and quote the message and
[2:03:48] they have ability. They can talk to
[2:03:50] people, right? They these youth worship.
[2:03:55] They sing songs. They testify and they
[2:03:57] still backslide.
[2:03:59] This is not exclusively to youth.
[2:04:02] Yeah.
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; See, it's it's pointless standing here
[2:04:08] when you're 50 years old and your
[2:04:10] testosterone is failing you so that you
[2:04:13] no longer are having as many lustful
[2:04:15] thoughts as a 16year-old and condemning
[2:04:18] them for being young.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; That's being hypocritical because as us
[2:04:23] ministers get older, we get shut down.
[2:04:26] We're literally losing our testosterone
[2:04:28] from the time we 40,
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; which means we're becoming less sexually
[2:04:32] active, our thoughts. In fact, if you
[2:04:36] try to make me watch a movie, I'm going
[2:04:37] to fall asleep in 5 minutes. A movie is
[2:04:40] not even a trap for me. If you make me
[2:04:42] listen to music, I'm thinking about my
[2:04:44] light bulb. Am I
[2:04:47] shut this shut the song off? I don't
[2:04:49] even want to hear it. I'm not even
[2:04:50] trapped by music. It's because I'm not
[2:04:52] youth anymore.
[2:04:54] and you're standing there preaching like
[2:04:56] you want them to be like you while their
[2:04:58] testosterone is at 400%.
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; So nowadays this issue of singing songs,
[2:05:10] worshiping, testifying and backsliding
[2:05:13] is not exclusive to youth because the
[2:05:15] older people are falling into this as
[2:05:17] well. Yeah,
[2:05:19] &gt;&gt; this is happening more and more even to
[2:05:21] parents and they're not admitting it
[2:05:22] because they're stuck in the same place.
[2:05:24] They can't confess it. They can't admit
[2:05:27] it because they're ashamed to do so
[2:05:28] because they're afraid what the church
[2:05:30] will do to them. There's a lot of
[2:05:33] ability going around which comes from
[2:05:35] the Holy Ghost anointing. Listen saints,
[2:05:38] the what the message that we have, the
[2:05:40] message of the hour is so powerful.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; I I cannot even give you a measure of
[2:05:45] how powerful it is. This message has
[2:05:48] turned simpletons like myself into what
[2:05:51] people call a teacher. I am embarrassed.
[2:05:56] This this message has turned simpletons
[2:05:58] around this country into great speakers.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; People who had stutters and people were
[2:06:04] rejected in society are now recognized
[2:06:08] names all over the world.
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; That's how powerful this thing is. This
[2:06:12] thing will turn your young people into
[2:06:14] philosophers.
[2:06:17] It's got that much ability in it. But
[2:06:20] what is needed here today people is the
[2:06:23] love for the person of the word.
[2:06:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is going to make the
[2:06:28] difference young people. In closing,
[2:06:31] that is what the prophet preached. I
[2:06:33] don't serve him legally. I serve him
[2:06:36] because I love him.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; And I do not do wrong things because I
[2:06:41] love him. And because I love him, if I
[2:06:44] do make a mistake, I am quick to repent
[2:06:47] and I make it right knowing that he has
[2:06:50] already forgiven me.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; And that I can never be lost.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; That's my position. That's the message.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; All the rest of the stuff, it's noise.
[2:07:05] Holy Ghost, Holy Spirit, quote this,
[2:07:09] quote that, this quote, that quote. It's
[2:07:11] noise.
[2:07:13] It is. It's noise. And people are going
[2:07:16] to go on about this. It's going to go
[2:07:18] across the world. It's going to But it's
[2:07:20] doing its purpose like it did when we
[2:07:22] preached the seven sealers open. We were
[2:07:24] crushed. We were smashed
[2:07:27] because other people were coming through
[2:07:28] with thunders and virtues and Peruia and
[2:07:31] this this uh type of thing for the
[2:07:33] coming. They rejected us. Brother Steve
[2:07:36] was preaching the opening of the seventh
[2:07:37] seal in the 80s. Brother Steve was
[2:07:39] preaching the cloud 28 minutes in the
[2:07:41] 80s and we were crushed for it. We
[2:07:45] remember the days when friends turned
[2:07:47] their backs on us and yet today they're
[2:07:50] believing it. Why? What? What happened?
[2:07:52] It made them go look at it. It made them
[2:07:55] turn it out. It made them study it. It
[2:07:57] made them question. It made them fight
[2:07:58] with one another. And then they open up
[2:08:01] their hearts. Same thing happened with
[2:08:03] the return ministry with the third pull.
[2:08:06] Same thing happened with with the open
[2:08:08] book now in this day with the coming
[2:08:10] with revelations 10 with all these
[2:08:12] things. It's got to come out. It's got
[2:08:14] to make questions. It's got to make
[2:08:16] turmoil before it eventually brings the
[2:08:18] elect in. Amen. That's what we're
[2:08:21] looking forward to. In the meantime, God
[2:08:24] keep us humble.
[2:08:26] Man, we who are we? We're just we're
[2:08:28] just people the same as everybody with
[2:08:30] the same faults, same issues. We need to
[2:08:34] be corrected. We we don't have it
[2:08:36] correct all the time. Uh in fact, I
[2:08:39] think most of the time we need a lot of
[2:08:41] correction. I I tell you people, you
[2:08:45] know, sometimes you're you got you get
[2:08:47] so used to teaching you got barely any
[2:08:49] emotion. You need to get some emotion.
[2:08:51] And yet some of you have tremendous
[2:08:53] amount of emotion and I love your
[2:08:55] worship, right? But I mean sometimes I
[2:08:58] wish some of you would get a bit loose
[2:09:00] jointed every now and then.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; Could help. But um you know this is how
[2:09:06] the word works with us. We're going to
[2:09:07] learn from one another. God's going to
[2:09:09] adjust us. God's going to change us.
[2:09:11] Never get stuck in thinking you're
[2:09:13] perfect.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; There is no perfection of the flesh.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; There's perfection of the spirit,
[2:09:19] perfection of the soul. You've got that.
[2:09:22] But your flesh can always be adjusted.
[2:09:25] Your dressing can always be better.
[2:09:28] Your hairstyle can always be better.
[2:09:30] Your speech can always be better. Your
[2:09:33] conduct can always be better. And we
[2:09:36] want to get there. We want to be the
[2:09:37] best that we can be. And if it's going
[2:09:39] to take the Holy Spirit to change us,
[2:09:42] let's submit to him.
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; Let's let him take over. Let's let him
[2:09:45] take control. And let's let him allow
[2:09:48] that word to change us and transform us.
[2:09:50] The Lord bless you. Let's bow our heads
[2:09:52] together.
