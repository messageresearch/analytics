[0:01] Amen. We like to greet you in the
[0:03] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[0:04] Jesus Christ. Certainly good to be with
[0:07] you uh this evening and uh I know we're
[0:11] breaking away from the Genesis uh
[0:13] series, the book of Genesis series just
[0:15] for a little bit. Um and that's just
[0:18] because this week is going to be a
[0:20] little different and um we're um having
[0:24] a brother's meeting on Sunday and um
[0:27] just a few changes taking place and so I
[0:30] had these questions which I felt were
[0:32] necessary and um probably good to do on
[0:36] a Wednesday night and we appreciate uh
[0:39] the questions. I've loved questions from
[0:42] the beginning of our ministry and uh
[0:44] we've had questions, our Wednesday night
[0:47] services for many years
[0:50] um up to before co
[0:53] and uh we really enjoy the fellowship
[0:55] that comes from it. So this evening I
[0:58] want to get right into it because I'm
[1:00] hoping it's not going to be too lengthy
[1:02] because it's a Wednesday night. So uh
[1:05] let's go to the question. We're going to
[1:07] share it with you and begin to read the
[1:10] question.
[1:12] Um,
[1:14] amen.
[1:15] Okay. So, question one is on the star of
[1:19] David. So, I'm just going to increase
[1:22] that my screen.
[1:24] Uh, so let's just read the question
[1:26] first. In your series teaching on seed
[1:29] when you spoke about the four elements
[1:31] and the star of David, some people have
[1:34] been given the impression that you said
[1:37] that star of David was a pagan symbol
[1:41] and it may encourage people who are
[1:44] anti-Israel.
[1:46] They also use the the things they read
[1:48] on the internet which make reference to
[1:50] the words of Steven in Acts 7:43
[1:55] regarding the star of Rempan.
[1:58] Please can you clarify what you meant in
[2:00] the things you said? Also, what is your
[2:03] point of view regarding the statements
[2:04] of the prophet on the star of David?
[2:07] Also, especially the quotes below.
[2:11] Okay, so let's read the quotes. quot
[2:14] from the Easter Seal um preached in
[2:17] Phoenix 1965.
[2:20] Uh paragraph 257
[2:22] like on Mount Transfiguration all the
[2:25] prophets and everything else is
[2:27] finished. All the days of the Lutheran,
[2:29] the Methodist, the Presbyterian, they're
[2:32] all right. But this is my beloved son.
[2:34] Hear ye him. The word of this hour, the
[2:37] hour of the seals, when all the
[2:39] mysteries back yonder that's been hid
[2:42] all these years, them is that great
[2:44] pyramid of time was stricken off the
[2:47] headstone. Make it hone down so that the
[2:50] star of David will settle into its
[2:53] place. So it's giving the
[2:55] uh sort of figure of the pyramid with
[3:00] the capstone struck off and then um the
[3:05] star of David settling into the place of
[3:07] that capstone and the great church of
[3:10] the living God will be raised like the
[3:13] wings of an eagle packed out yonder into
[3:15] glory. Yes.
[3:17] And then we look at the message ashamed
[3:20] paragon 7 uh also 65 he says but if
[3:25] anybody ever looked at what I call notes
[3:27] look like I want to preach about the
[3:29] morning star I'll draw a star and if I
[3:32] want to preach something about I make it
[3:35] all in symbols here scratches nobody can
[3:37] ever know what it was while I'm out I'm
[3:40] thinking of anything I got to on riding
[3:42] on the road sometimes the car is jumping
[3:44] up and down and I'll jot this down and
[3:47] say this and that. Make little signs,
[3:49] crosses and bridges and all kinds of
[3:50] things like I want to preach on the
[3:52] descending of the star. That's where we
[3:54] want to get to. I'll put the pyramid,
[3:56] draw it out here and put the fivepoint
[3:58] star of David coming down on it. I know
[4:00] where I'm going in the scriptures like
[4:02] that and Moses a certain thing he done
[4:05] just make like turkey tracks. So I think
[4:07] here he was just explaining
[4:10] like how he arrives at or makes notes
[4:13] for how he preaches and he's talking
[4:15] about how it's you know such a scroll
[4:18] and lines everywhere but in there he's
[4:21] he's talking about as if he wants to
[4:22] preach on the descending star and
[4:25] drawing a pyramid and so on. So that was
[4:27] just a quote telling us you know about
[4:30] his notes.
[4:32] All right. So basically the question is
[4:35] based on the series that I did in
[4:38] teaching on seed and when I preached on
[4:40] the four elements and um so you know
[4:44] basically what has happened is there's a
[4:47] question that has has come up and I must
[4:49] say it this way
[4:51] the brother who's asked me the question
[4:53] is probably one of the finest Christians
[4:55] you'll ever find and you know real
[4:58] wonderful spirit of God and uh So
[5:02] nothing uh negative here just purely
[5:05] concern for the children of God and you
[5:08] know to bring clarity to this. So this
[5:10] is what I love about fellowship and uh
[5:13] so um it's in that teaching on seed
[5:16] where I I put up diagrams and spoke
[5:19] about the star of David and of course
[5:22] you know maybe there are people who
[5:24] would misinterpret
[5:26] um what you say. So the question is, am
[5:31] I saying the star of David is a pagan
[5:33] symbol? Am I speaking against Israel? Um
[5:37] is there a scriptural reference to this?
[5:39] And is it Acts 7:43 where Steven speaks
[5:42] about the star of Reman?
[5:45] And um and then so the point is can I
[5:49] clarify what is said and also comment on
[5:51] the quotes because how can we speak
[5:53] against if it sounds like it we are
[5:55] speaking against the star of David. How
[5:58] can we speak against the star of David
[5:59] when the prophet speaks about the star
[6:02] of David descending upon the capstone uh
[6:04] to cap off the pyramid.
[6:07] Okay. So, um, first I want to say, uh,
[6:12] that YouTube is a very dangerous place
[6:16] and I don't like it. I don't like how it
[6:18] is handled, but I'm not the one that can
[6:21] give you solutions
[6:23] u for how it can be handled. Farbe, I
[6:26] think um, if I'm going to be 50 years
[6:29] old, I'm I'm way too old to have any
[6:31] ideas on how to handle social media
[6:34] already.
[6:35] um it's it's in the hand of mostly young
[6:38] people and uh you know people who handle
[6:41] social media they know what they do and
[6:43] um there's no way that I can have
[6:46] solutions on how to do this but there
[6:48] definitely is a culture that is being
[6:50] created around YouTube and uh one that
[6:54] we uh preachers or people who speak and
[6:58] are videoed we cannot manage and when
[7:01] you're behind the pulpit
[7:03] you know you're not thinking that you're
[7:05] on camera and um that's the one thing I
[7:07] hate about the camera is that you know
[7:09] being uh on camera knowing that you're
[7:13] going to be seen and heard uh you try to
[7:16] be careful extra careful so that you
[7:19] know uh you don't want to offend anybody
[7:22] but but a lot of times you have to
[7:25] follow what the Holy Spirit is telling
[7:27] you because you know offending people is
[7:30] not a problem
[7:32] saying what God wants you to say is what
[7:35] we need to do and telling the truth is
[7:37] what is necessary. So that being said,
[7:40] you know, we can
[7:42] uh being preachers, we can only do the
[7:45] best that we can and uh to bring forth
[7:48] the word and then trust God uh to do
[7:51] what he he knows best uh with the
[7:54] people. However,
[7:57] YouTube has become one of the mediums of
[7:59] the fourth dimension uh of communication
[8:03] um by which we were able to we are able
[8:07] to reach the world today and uh to put
[8:10] the truth out to them and we have no
[8:13] control. I mean, we can have some
[8:16] control if we have a channel and we, you
[8:18] know, from the the little that I know,
[8:21] you can if you want to just, you know,
[8:23] make it to your subscribers, I suppose,
[8:25] and whatever. But, um, we want the
[8:28] message to get out to the world, and
[8:31] it's part of the fourth dimension, just
[8:32] as the tapes were used in the 70s, 80s,
[8:35] and '90s. Uh unfortunately
[8:39] we try our best to be careful and say
[8:42] things in the best way we can but people
[8:44] will always misunderstand us based on
[8:48] their interpretations of what we are
[8:51] saying. And a lot of times, you know,
[8:52] when you're you're from a certain
[8:54] country and other people are from
[8:56] another country or you you're speaking
[8:58] and somebody else thinks in a different
[9:00] language, they listen to what you say
[9:02] and uh they interpret it from the way
[9:05] they're thinking and it may not be uh
[9:08] you know what you are saying. But you,
[9:10] we have, imagine all that peril, but we
[9:13] have to try and um uh trust that the
[9:17] Holy Spirit will reveal it to those whom
[9:20] God has called, knowing full well that
[9:24] there are going to be troublemakers who
[9:26] are just going to do their best to come
[9:28] against us no matter what we say.
[9:32] All right? So uh unfortunately that's
[9:34] how it is and uh every place you know
[9:37] every country every city has its own
[9:41] unique problems because of the history
[9:44] of the place and the society that you
[9:46] live in and uh like for example North
[9:49] America has a problem with
[9:51] intellectualism and liberalism.
[9:54] They can't help it. They're the most
[9:55] developed nation on the planet, the most
[9:57] developed continent on the planet and uh
[10:00] they're naturally going to push back at
[10:02] anything that any anybody says because
[10:05] they are far more educated than the rest
[10:07] of the world. So that is a problem that
[10:09] they have to face in that area. Europe
[10:12] as well, Europe is has a problem with
[10:14] intellectualism and orthodoxy like uh
[10:18] the Americas have shifted away from
[10:20] orthodoxy. They're the ones who who are
[10:23] be who are becoming a lot more liberal.
[10:26] But Europe is very much into orthodoxy.
[10:29] So everything has to be legalistic. Has
[10:31] to be this way. Has to be the original
[10:33] way it is set. The original way it was
[10:34] written. And you know with the result I
[10:37] mean you can if you go through Europe
[10:39] you're going to look at denominational
[10:41] churches and the majority of them are
[10:43] empty because the orthodoxy does not
[10:45] work to to uh grab the attention of the
[10:49] public. uh in Africa and Asia we have
[10:52] problems with superstition and culture
[10:55] uh and etc and and that gets in the way
[10:57] of revelation. It gets in the way of
[11:00] understanding the scriptures correctly
[11:01] and it leads to sensationalism and uh
[11:04] depending on signs and wonders and uh
[11:07] being afraid of of the fifth dimension
[11:10] and so on. So you know like the prophet
[11:13] says when he spoke in the church ages
[11:15] and he he uh spoke of each um city
[11:19] Ephesus, Smyrna and so on and he spoke
[11:21] about each city having its own spirit.
[11:24] Um that's very much like what it is in
[11:29] every city in every country. Each one
[11:31] has its own spirit. So that's what I'm
[11:33] saying. What I'm saying is no matter
[11:36] what we speak
[11:38] uh and if we're going to be out there on
[11:40] social media whichever platform people
[11:43] put us on uh and somebody is going to
[11:46] hear it from from the place they are
[11:48] coming from they are going to interpret
[11:49] it based on the place they are coming
[11:52] from and most of the time it's not at
[11:55] all what we are saying.
[11:57] So, in trying to get the message out to
[12:00] the world, you know, I'm very
[12:02] knowledgeable that we may cause a lot of
[12:04] problems for other churches and pastors
[12:07] in the message uh who may not see things
[12:10] exactly the way we do. There's a there's
[12:12] a contention, you know, that should we
[12:15] put our voices out there because we're
[12:17] going to cause trouble for other message
[12:19] pastors and uh and you know, and maybe
[12:23] we should be more careful, maybe we
[12:25] should not do it. And um I've spoken to
[12:29] ministers
[12:31] who are out there on YouTube and I've
[12:33] been someone who was very reluctant um
[12:36] you know we don't even put all our
[12:39] videos out on YouTube. So in trying to
[12:42] get this message out to the world no
[12:44] doubt you realize and from those that I
[12:47] have spoken to they they they realize
[12:49] you are going to cause some trouble. But
[12:52] we have to trust the Holy Spirit in each
[12:54] one of us. Uh that he will deal with
[12:56] each situation within within each church
[12:59] correctly. Uh because he knows all
[13:02] things and we can trust him. And then if
[13:04] it is the Holy Spirit in each of our
[13:06] churches, we'll be able to solve these
[13:08] issues. Um I mean look at what happened
[13:11] when everyone was listening to the tapes
[13:13] of only one man and how many different
[13:16] kinds of uh uh interpretations they
[13:18] were. So that being said, you know,
[13:22] coming to this question,
[13:24] I had to go back and listen to what I
[13:27] said because I'm thinking, how did it
[13:30] ever come? Like for the life of me, I
[13:32] don't understand how anyone could have
[13:34] misinterpreted what I said in when I
[13:36] preached on the teaching on seed
[13:39] regarding the star of David. Obviously I
[13:41] thought when I spoke that I was quite
[13:43] clear but but clearly from where it is
[13:46] listened to it it could be
[13:49] misinterpreted by other people. And I
[13:51] think sometimes what what happens is if
[13:54] people who use YouTube, you know, take a
[13:57] clip of a portion of a message and then
[14:00] send it around, uh it causes people who
[14:03] listen to it without the full context of
[14:05] the message uh in which it was spoken
[14:08] and then interpret it based on what they
[14:11] just hear in that clip. Now, I'm not
[14:13] saying that people should not make
[14:14] clips. Honestly, again, I don't have the
[14:17] best solution for social media. I
[14:19] respect all the people who do whatever
[14:21] they want to do and all I know is that
[14:23] it is part of the fourth dimension and
[14:25] God is going to inspire us to use it in
[14:28] some way to get this word across to the
[14:30] people. As for the few people that and I
[14:33] must say this, there are very few people
[14:35] who get offended with most statements
[14:38] that we make. There are hundreds of
[14:40] people that are not offended and are
[14:41] just blessed by the word. So that is
[14:44] something to take into consideration.
[14:46] There are always going to be the few who
[14:49] actually get offended or want to use an
[14:52] opportunity to fight back. There will be
[14:55] people that uh believe in only their
[14:58] doctrine and disagree with everybody
[15:00] else and will have to fight back or make
[15:02] comments or something like that. So this
[15:05] u particular question on this particular
[15:08] subject on the star of David is
[15:11] something that I have spoken about in
[15:13] our church you know many years ago and
[15:17] uh and I've spoken about when I say many
[15:19] years ago I would say before co and
[15:22] nobody in my church has ever gotten the
[15:25] impression that I am against the star of
[15:28] David or anti-Israel in any way and I'm
[15:31] I'm preaching for 25 years. So, I want
[15:35] to um
[15:38] explain to you uh uh what what exactly
[15:41] happened. So, what I'm going to do is
[15:43] just to answer the question and try to
[15:46] put this out there. I'm going to read my
[15:49] actual notes for you and explain
[15:52] uh what what what it is that I was
[15:54] speaking of. So if you remember in the
[15:56] teaching on the seed I was speaking
[15:58] about um um bringing the seed and typing
[16:02] it to the believer and show you how
[16:04] things work. The the subject was called
[16:06] how it all works. And we were we were
[16:09] speaking specifically about the four
[16:11] elements that is ground uh water, air
[16:15] and light. Right? And in that teaching
[16:18] on seed we were talking about those four
[16:20] elements. So the the thing about it is
[16:24] those four elements are common in almost
[16:28] every religion and belief and whether
[16:32] it's pagans, heathens from every corner
[16:36] of the globe. Um it is believed in, it
[16:39] is spoken of, it is written about there,
[16:42] there's folklore about it, there's
[16:44] there's scriptures of other religions
[16:46] written about it. Right? So my note
[16:49] starts with the four elements and this
[16:51] is what my notes say exactly. Um the
[16:55] four things that a seed needs to bring
[16:57] forth its life have always been
[16:59] worshiped by nations around the world
[17:02] among heathens and pagans. They believe
[17:04] that certain gods provided or supplied
[17:08] these four elements.
[17:11] Hinduism and Buddhism hinges on a lot a
[17:14] lot on these elements. Aristotle and
[17:17] other Greek philosophers believe that
[17:19] all matter was made up by these elements
[17:23] that they are the building blocks of
[17:25] nature. Scientists say that many of
[17:27] their discoveries were built on the
[17:30] philosophies of these men through modern
[17:32] science. I must remember the
[17:34] philosophies came first and science came
[17:36] later and that because these men spoke
[17:40] about these building blocks of nature
[17:42] before scientific experiments came to
[17:44] the great advancements they are today.
[17:47] The first scientific uh theories were
[17:50] based on teachings of Aristotle and
[17:53] Socrates and so on. uh the building
[17:55] blocks of of um before they got to atoms
[17:58] they were talking about earth, water,
[18:01] air and light or fire. And so uh
[18:05] continuing in my notes here, it says um
[18:08] and scientists that say that many of the
[18:10] discoveries were built on the
[18:11] philosophies of these men through modern
[18:13] science broken these four down to the
[18:15] elements on the per periodic table and
[18:18] atoms, earth, air, water, and fire or
[18:22] light. Believe it or not, later cultures
[18:25] were aware of something else they called
[18:27] ether, which they believed was space
[18:30] outside of Earth's atmosphere, almost
[18:32] like a fifth element.
[18:34] Uh, so much is credited to the Greek
[18:36] scientists and philosophers. And yet,
[18:38] the first chapter of the Bible tells of
[18:41] God setting earth, light, water, and air
[18:45] in order upon the earth. So, by that I
[18:47] was saying
[18:49] um the people who came up with this came
[18:51] up with it. some in the last few hundred
[18:54] years, some in a few thousand years ago.
[18:56] But when we look at Genesis from Genesis
[18:59] chapter 1
[19:01] uh in the first few verses is it is God
[19:04] setting up the earth, the air, the
[19:07] firmament, the atmosphere, the water,
[19:10] the light begins with the light and he
[19:12] starts setting things up. There are
[19:14] these four elements that God is bringing
[19:16] and it's in the first chapter of the
[19:19] Bible, right? So that's what I was
[19:21] referring to. And then I said in fact um
[19:27] uh though these things are credited to
[19:29] scientists and philosophers this is the
[19:31] first chapter in the Bible and there are
[19:34] many this is where I speak about the
[19:36] star of David because there's so much of
[19:39] symbology about these four elements and
[19:42] uh I got here in fact there are many who
[19:44] suspect that because they have no
[19:46] knowledge of where the Jews got the star
[19:48] of David from that it might have
[19:50] originated from their own
[19:52] acknowledgement of the four elements.
[19:54] That means the Jews own acknowledgment
[19:58] of the four elements. So they what I'm
[20:00] saying is some people have suspected
[20:02] that right? So then I showed you and
[20:05] I'll share this with you this diagram
[20:10] of this where you can see the star of
[20:12] David
[20:14] uh how it is brought together and then
[20:16] you've got water which is the triangle
[20:18] facing downwards earth which is the
[20:20] triangle facing downwards with the line
[20:22] across it air triangle facing upward
[20:25] with the line across it and fire the
[20:29] triangle facing upward and so um that's
[20:32] what I showed you in the slides uh in
[20:35] that and then I've got later in
[20:38] Christianity there were philosophers who
[20:40] drew on these models of the past and
[20:43] came up with fantastic ideas to teach
[20:45] certain concepts which were quite
[20:47] inspiring and the issue they used the
[20:49] the different symbols which originated
[20:52] from paganism to teach this subject
[20:54] that's the issue but you can see for
[20:56] yourself how amazing it is so then what
[20:59] I did was I showed you how that the the
[21:02] Christian church took that star apart
[21:06] and because of the teachings
[21:10] uh of the Jews and then making it their
[21:13] own, the Christian church evolved that
[21:16] and this is what they came up with,
[21:18] right? Um they flipped it around.
[21:21] They've got father, son, holy spirit, a
[21:23] triangle with the point facing down,
[21:26] father, son on the left, holy spirit at
[21:29] the bottom. And that is God. That is God
[21:31] looking down. And then the next triangle
[21:34] they've got man, which is the triangle
[21:36] looking upwards. And man is made of
[21:39] body, spirit, and soul. As God is
[21:41] father, son, holy spirit. And then when
[21:43] you put those two together, you combine
[21:46] the two triangles, you get the star of
[21:48] David, which is father, son, holy spirit
[21:53] joined with body, spirit, soul of man.
[21:56] And that is God and man. Now, if you
[21:58] look at that, what you're actually
[22:00] looking at is the God man or the
[22:04] Messiah,
[22:05] right? The Star of David speaks of the
[22:08] Messiah. Now, I didn't make this up. I'm
[22:10] not even calling this a uh pagan thing.
[22:13] I'm actually telling you I'm actually
[22:16] admiring this. So, I don't know how it
[22:20] it got uh uh ever got misconstrued that
[22:23] I was calling it a pagan symbol, right?
[22:26] But what I'm what I was pointing to that
[22:28] in this very thing are symbols of the
[22:32] four elements. Right? So obviously the
[22:36] gentile the Christian gentiles believed
[22:38] in it because they believe that the
[22:41] worship of God is the mixture of Judaism
[22:44] and Christianity. One of the earliest
[22:47] symbols is the joining of the monora
[22:49] with the triangle base and the fish with
[22:51] the triangular tail which forms a
[22:53] six-sided star. So I'm I'm going to show
[22:56] that to you um uh in a little while. So
[23:00] these four elements are I've got in my
[23:03] notes here. These four elements are not
[23:06] to be seen as pagan beliefs. In other
[23:10] words, earth, water, air, and light or
[23:13] fire. Don't look at them and think they
[23:16] are pagan belief. Right? Don't shy away
[23:19] from them when it is spoken of uh by
[23:22] pagans and Catholics. Remember this is
[23:24] my point. God created these things.
[23:27] Pagans and Catholics used what God
[23:30] created to form their own beliefs, their
[23:33] own religions and uh in trying to
[23:36] understand different things about God.
[23:38] So we just we just don't have to make a
[23:41] big deal about it, right? I don't have
[23:43] to go put up symbols about earth, air,
[23:46] water, fire in my home or in our church
[23:49] and make a big deal about it.
[23:52] We don't have to do that, right? Uh why?
[23:55] Because these four elements don't have
[23:58] any powers, any specific powers. The
[24:01] symbols don't have any powers. So, they
[24:04] just don't. I don't believe that we
[24:06] should make a big deal about it. So,
[24:09] those that which I just read to you now
[24:12] was my actual notes. Um you know, uh and
[24:16] that I also sent out to the people. I
[24:18] forwarded my notes to the people uh
[24:21] after every service that I preach and um
[24:24] so it wasn't something that was hidden
[24:26] or anything. So if you listen to the
[24:28] context of the entire service which was
[24:30] about the actual uh title of the service
[24:34] was possessing the gates of the enemy
[24:36] and I spent the introduction speaking
[24:39] about the four elements earth, water,
[24:41] air and light. and I explain how these
[24:43] elements were respected by pagan people
[24:46] for thousands of years. So just so you
[24:50] know the official definition a lot of
[24:52] people just throw the word pagan out but
[24:54] a lot of people don't know what pagan
[24:56] actually refers to. So it it was derived
[25:00] probably by Judeo-Christian people. So
[25:02] Jews and Christians uh because uh Jews
[25:06] and Christians worship only one God u
[25:09] and Islam of course came later then they
[25:11] become they were called the Abrahamic
[25:13] religions but Judeo-Christian people
[25:16] worship one God while all the other
[25:17] religions are polytheistic meaning they
[25:21] worship many gods right so and a lot of
[25:25] these people worship the earth and the
[25:27] air and the light and the rain and the
[25:30] elements uh um around us and they make
[25:33] them deities and so on. So they were
[25:36] called pagans because they don't conform
[25:38] to the beliefs of Judeo-Christian values
[25:42] and Judeo-Christian
[25:44] uh theology if you would. So uh before
[25:48] religions became sophisticated right
[25:51] before books were written and theories
[25:54] were written and ideologies were written
[25:56] and before scriptures were written by
[25:59] pagan people um religion was very simple
[26:04] um with pagans and heathens was very
[26:06] simple. They just worshiped the earth
[26:08] because the earth brought forth crops.
[26:10] They worshiped the light because it gave
[26:12] warmth. They worshiped the rain because
[26:14] it gave water. They worshiped the wind
[26:15] because it cooled things down. Um, they
[26:19] worshiped it and and they even created
[26:22] idols believing that maybe a god, one of
[26:25] the gods of theirs produced those
[26:28] things, right? So, they would come to
[26:31] worship these four elements uh and maybe
[26:34] even symbolize them by a god or a
[26:37] goddess. So, what I'm saying is those
[26:40] pagans don't own the four elements. They
[26:43] were created by God, right? So, we
[26:46] shouldn't see these things as pagan.
[26:49] That was my point. Because these four
[26:51] elements were created by God. Pagans use
[26:54] God's creation to form their own
[26:56] beliefs. It doesn't belong to pagans.
[27:00] I don't care. They can call themselves
[27:01] Wiccans, witches, wizards, whatever. And
[27:04] they use tree bark and leaves and
[27:06] feathers and whatever. They can they can
[27:08] do whatever they want to. But God
[27:10] created those things. that doesn't mean
[27:12] I must be afraid of the things that they
[27:14] use or they speak about or talk about,
[27:16] right? It doesn't belong to them. That
[27:19] was my point. So my point in preaching
[27:21] about this and starting about it uh with
[27:23] the four elements and explaining it was
[27:27] to tell you don't come and tell me that
[27:29] we are preaching pagan beliefs. So uh
[27:33] when we talk about earth, water, air and
[27:36] light or fire, don't tell us, hey,
[27:38] brother Al, you're preaching pagan
[27:40] things, right? So when I spoke about the
[27:44] star of David, I was not saying that the
[27:46] Jews took it from the pagans. I clearly
[27:50] said this was suspected by people that
[27:53] this is where the Jews took it from
[27:54] because of their beliefs. Frankly, I
[27:56] don't even know why the Jews took it. It
[27:59] doesn't make any sense to me in terms of
[28:01] when you read the Torah and the Jewish
[28:03] books. Um maybe if it was a 12ointed
[28:06] star, it would make more sense, right?
[28:08] Because you'd think, well, 12 tribes of
[28:10] Israel. I mean, when you look at that
[28:12] star, there's a six-pointed star.
[28:16] Nothing about it pops out at you like
[28:18] it's from the Bible. It's from some
[28:20] scripture or type something. But the
[28:22] only thing you can think of if you look
[28:24] at six points, you think, well, six is
[28:26] the number of a man. That's about all
[28:29] and maybe us message people would have
[28:31] been more comfortable if it was like a
[28:33] sevenpoint star then you know it would
[28:34] be more attractive. What I'm saying is
[28:37] you kind of look at the star and think
[28:39] oh yes it means something uh you know
[28:42] concerning Israel. If it were not called
[28:45] the star of David and we saw it we would
[28:47] never even think this came from Israel.
[28:50] Right? So the Jews themselves are
[28:53] divided on the subject. There are many
[28:55] different sects of Judaism that differ
[29:00] on where things come from and how they
[29:02] were derived and what to be uh what is
[29:06] to be more important than something
[29:07] else. They are divided on the very
[29:09] thing. And um but the one thing they all
[29:13] agree on concerning the star is that it
[29:17] has great significance of expressing the
[29:20] union of God with Israel by an invisible
[29:25] expression and a visible expression.
[29:28] That's what that star represents. uh the
[29:31] pagans had the same star and and that's
[29:35] what you need to uh to to find out why
[29:37] this happened right so the Jewish
[29:40] explanation doesn't match the
[29:42] explanation of the pagans yet the pagans
[29:45] use the same symbol for similar
[29:47] expressions you know you'll be shocked
[29:50] um
[29:52] um even before I studied all this I for
[29:55] some I realize some people in the world
[29:58] don't know what race I am you You know
[30:00] when you travel out uh into the rest of
[30:03] the world you realize how ignorant some
[30:05] people are. Uh you know I say I'm from
[30:07] South Africa they don't realize I'm I'm
[30:10] from Indian origin. So my family are
[30:13] from Indian origin and my and their
[30:17] their religion was Hinduism. Okay. So if
[30:20] you go into Hinduism which dates back
[30:23] like 4,000 years right right back to the
[30:27] time when the Babylonians and the
[30:28] Sumerianss and Numidians
[30:31] and these this religion my ancestors
[30:35] religion has a six-point star which they
[30:37] call the same thing two triangles being
[30:41] meshed together and they call it the
[30:43] sacred male and the sacred female.
[30:46] This has existed for centuries right?
[30:49] Um, so if you if you go and tell the
[30:52] Hindus that this is a thing unique to
[30:54] Israel, they're going to laugh at you
[30:56] because they had it long before that,
[30:58] right? So you look at this say, well,
[31:01] brother Al, definitely but we don't have
[31:04] any knowledge that Israel traveled to
[31:07] India to the deepest parts where and
[31:09] here's the other thing. Even that
[31:11] sixpoint star that is in Hinduism
[31:15] does not uh did not originate in all of
[31:18] India where all the Indians all the
[31:21] Hindus believe in it. No, if you go to
[31:23] India,
[31:25] India though it has Hinduism, it has its
[31:28] own denominations and thousands of uh
[31:32] sects and beliefs and languages and so
[31:35] not all of them have it, right? But they
[31:37] have certain common things. So uh their
[31:41] explanation of the Hebrews regarding the
[31:45] star and the pagans uh um explanations
[31:50] are not the same yet the sign is exactly
[31:54] the same. So this doesn't shock me
[31:56] because uh and and I'm someone who I
[32:00] read a lot. I I don't I'm not someone
[32:02] who uh reads by Google. These are all
[32:05] books behind me. I prefer books because
[32:08] they're they're a lot more reliable than
[32:10] the internet for me. So, um, it doesn't
[32:14] shock me because, you know, when I read
[32:18] the histories of of the world, all the
[32:20] races, all the continents, all the
[32:22] cultures, all the traditions, when you
[32:25] go back like 4,000 years, do you realize
[32:30] that there were many people with many
[32:32] languages, but there wasn't a lot of uh
[32:38] uh books written in their languages In
[32:42] other words, um if you went to India and
[32:46] then you went to South America and then
[32:48] you went to Egypt and then you went to
[32:50] maybe Africa or somewhere, they had
[32:54] languages that they spoke in but they
[32:57] did not write it. There was no writing.
[33:01] There were very few people, few uh
[33:03] generations of people or rather cultures
[33:06] of people that actually wrote things
[33:08] down. And even if they did the majority
[33:11] of public did not write things. So
[33:14] however everywhere in the world your
[33:18] simple basic shapes of things were
[33:22] common. You had pyramids which are
[33:25] common in India, South America, Africa,
[33:28] everywhere around the triangle was a
[33:31] very common symbol. Why? I don't know.
[33:35] Uh, squares were very common. Circles
[33:38] were very common. I would assume if you
[33:42] looked up and you see the sun
[33:45] as a really primitive human, you you see
[33:49] the sun, you see its shape. You see the
[33:51] moon, you see its shape. It's a circle.
[33:54] And and the Bible says the language of
[33:56] the stars is spoken and heard in every
[33:59] part of the world. It's Psalm 19. There
[34:01] isn't a place on earth where their voice
[34:03] is not heard. So when they look up at
[34:05] the stars and they see shapes, they see
[34:07] geometric shapes, they, you know, it's a
[34:09] common thing. So what I'm saying is if
[34:12] there were shared language of symbols
[34:15] and squares and triangles and spirals.
[34:18] So it doesn't shock me because um the
[34:21] star of David, two people taking
[34:23] triangles from two different continents
[34:25] at the same time and not far from each
[34:27] other and put them together and think,
[34:29] huh, it looks great. you know, so they
[34:32] shared so much um in terms of symbology
[34:37] in those early years that now moving
[34:41] forward the Christians who came
[34:44] obviously after the Sumerians, the
[34:46] Greeks, the Romans, the Jews, here come
[34:49] the Christians into a world already
[34:53] filled with triangles, squares,
[34:56] pyramids, stars,
[34:58] spirals, anks, crosses, you name it. The
[35:03] Christians came in and these symbols
[35:05] were already available to them. So
[35:08] Christians of different kinds moving
[35:09] through Gentiles absorbed some of these
[35:12] symbols, right? And so we uh we we
[35:16] actually found in history there was a
[35:19] symbol called the messianic seal. And uh
[35:22] I showed this to our church you know
[35:24] many many years ago uh before co um when
[35:28] we studied some of these things and but
[35:30] I'll show it to you now again.
[35:33] Um here is the symbol called the
[35:36] messianic seal. Okay. Um this symbol as
[35:40] you can see uh you can divide it into
[35:43] three parts right. The top section there
[35:46] is the manora or the seven golden
[35:48] candlesticks and then the middle section
[35:51] looks like it is the star of David and
[35:53] the bottom section is a fish with its
[35:56] face facing downward. Right? So when you
[35:59] look at that you see three parts and yet
[36:02] according to the messianic
[36:06] uh um those who follow messianic Judaism
[36:10] it is actually two parts. If you look at
[36:12] it, it is the manora or the seven golden
[36:15] candlesticks with a triangular base and
[36:18] the fish with a triangular tail, right?
[36:23] And when they put them together, you get
[36:26] the star of David in the middle, right?
[36:28] So this this symbol was actually found
[36:32] on artifacts
[36:34] in Jerusalem and in other places and it
[36:37] is called the messianic seal. Right? the
[36:42] star of David
[36:44] formed by the the base of the
[36:46] candlesticks and the tail of the fish
[36:49] and they put together you see the star
[36:52] of David form, right? So these Messianic
[36:56] uh Judaism Christians claim that this
[36:58] symbol predates the Star of David and
[37:01] there are artifacts covered in Jerusalem
[37:03] that predate when the Jews first used
[37:05] the Star of David. That's what they
[37:07] claim to me. It doesn't matter who used
[37:10] it, who used what first. I don't care
[37:12] and we shouldn't care because we are not
[37:15] a society that depends on symbology.
[37:18] Right? So, so here's my stance on
[37:20] religious symbols. And and this is what
[37:23] I really want to want to say.
[37:26] I place no value in any symbols at all.
[37:31] And I have taught our church not to. And
[37:35] the reason in my
[37:37] uh ancestral Indian culture symbolism is
[37:40] a very big problem because it is
[37:42] directly linked to idolatry. If you have
[37:45] things in your home that you can place
[37:48] value on your Hindu relatives see that
[37:52] they believe it's your idol and you
[37:54] can't tell them any different. They'll
[37:55] tell you it's an idol. So I saw this
[37:58] myself growing up as a teenager and my
[38:01] Hindu grandmother would come to our home
[38:03] for a holiday and uh she would sit with
[38:06] us in our family altar and pray with us
[38:09] and I would see her walk up to a picture
[38:11] of Jesus in our home the the Hoffman's
[38:14] head. My dad had that in our living room
[38:17] and um my grandmother would go and bow
[38:21] her head before put our hands together
[38:23] like that and uh pray to Jesus and we
[38:27] would stand there shocked because we
[38:29] don't do that right and um so later what
[38:34] happened you know I grew up I became a
[38:36] pastor was pastoring Durban from the
[38:39] year 2001 and in the third year of my
[38:42] ministry in 2003 three
[38:45] uh a man walked off the street and came
[38:48] to my front door. He was a Hindu man and
[38:51] he was asking for some charity. And when
[38:54] I opened my door, he looked into my
[38:56] house and he saw a picture of the
[38:58] Hoffman's head. I had a small one
[38:59] somebody had given me. I put it up in my
[39:02] living room and and there he saw it on
[39:04] the on the wall and immediately he'll
[39:07] and of course you know when when
[39:08] somebody comes in and they're looking
[39:09] for charity they're begging you know
[39:12] they try to uh you know make some like
[39:15] common ground with you and try to be
[39:17] extra nice obviously they want you to
[39:19] give them some money or some food or
[39:21] something right so he sees the picture
[39:23] and he recognizes the picture and uh
[39:27] obviously he recognizes it not because
[39:29] it's just Jesus Christ, but the
[39:32] particular Hoffman's head picture,
[39:34] right? And he says to me, "Hey, I know
[39:37] you church guys. You're the guys who
[39:39] worship the eagles, right?" I said, "No,
[39:42] we don't." He said, "Yes, you do." He
[39:45] said, "I have neighbors who go to your
[39:47] church and they have the same pictures
[39:50] and they have eagles everywhere. They
[39:53] have the eagles on their cars, on their
[39:55] front door, on the gate, on the books,
[39:58] on the walls, in the gardens, and all
[40:00] over their church. They're just eagles.
[40:03] He said, "See, you guys have you guys
[40:05] worship idols, too." He says, "Help me
[40:07] out with some money, man, to feed my
[40:09] family, please." So, you know, needless
[40:12] to say, I was shocked because
[40:15] I know we don't worship eagles. I know
[40:17] we don't worship any idols but the fact
[40:20] is that when we put value or when we
[40:23] look like we put value on certain
[40:25] symbols it gives impressions to people
[40:28] impressions we are not aware of uh to
[40:31] other religions around us. So that day I
[40:34] took down the Hoffman's head out of my
[40:36] living room and put it elsewhere.
[40:40] Some of you might criticize me for that
[40:41] but you don't live in the area I live
[40:43] in. And to me, if I'm going to have
[40:45] people walking off the street and see
[40:47] this, I don't want them to think I'm an
[40:49] idol worshipper. And I want to have a
[40:51] different conversation with them. And I
[40:53] want to talk about the word because the
[40:54] word to me is and I'm definitely not an
[40:56] idol worship. And I don't look at
[40:58] pictures and whether it's a cloud or
[41:00] husband's head and look to it and pray.
[41:02] I do not do that. To me, God is a spirit
[41:04] and and he must be worshiped in spirit
[41:06] and in truth. That's my that's my
[41:09] inspiration.
[41:10] And uh as much as I love pictures and I
[41:13] love drawing, I could be like a minor
[41:16] artist, I draw pretty good, but I uh and
[41:20] I always had this uh feeling inside to
[41:22] you know because I my mind is creative
[41:25] and I I wanted to draw the four living
[41:27] creatures and because it always
[41:29] fascinated me Ezekiel's vision and
[41:31] Revelations 4 and I want and I started
[41:34] some years ago I started drawing this
[41:35] and I really wanted to put this thing
[41:37] together and I thought maybe I'll even
[41:39] do a a wooden carving of it. And the
[41:42] moment I started forming it, I realized
[41:44] I can't do this because if I'm preaching
[41:47] these as the anointings of the Holy
[41:48] Ghost and I'm going to draw a picture of
[41:50] it, I'm going to put a picture in
[41:52] people's mind and they're going to think
[41:54] that there's creatures like this
[41:55] literally living in heaven. And I don't
[41:58] want to do that. So I just stopped. So
[42:00] this is what I'm saying is the
[42:01] inspiration
[42:03] uh by which um I I preach today. So uh I
[42:08] I've also and and the thing is I've had
[42:11] so much experiences with people in the
[42:12] church. I've heard of all the
[42:14] paraphernalia that message people have
[42:16] and keep momentos of the prophet rocks
[42:19] that they've taken from Sabino Canyon
[42:21] pictures and artifacts and that have
[42:24] spiritual significance. And I've even
[42:26] heard and seen people believing that
[42:29] some of these things they have have
[42:30] supernatural powers in them. Till this
[42:33] day, I do not keep religious pictures or
[42:36] symbols in my house.
[42:39] In my study, I have things people give
[42:42] me. Like here behind me, I've got an
[42:44] eagle from my from my dad's uh study. I
[42:48] took it after he had passed away. I've
[42:50] got a little cross made of Lego um from
[42:53] made by my little boy. Told me he wants
[42:55] me to keep it there, you know. and uh
[42:58] things I pick up from, you know, people
[43:00] give me as gifts. I have them and I've
[43:02] got stuff all around me that I use for
[43:04] teaching, uh drawings and diagrams and
[43:07] things like that. So u that being said I
[43:12] would be coming back to the star of
[43:14] David and concerning Israel. I would be
[43:16] an absolute hypocrite as a Christian to
[43:20] speak against the star of David to call
[43:22] it a pagan symbol when the cross that
[43:26] Christians so rever is heavily tied to
[43:29] paganism. It was a pagan symbol long
[43:31] before it became a Christian symbol for
[43:34] message people. Do you know the
[43:36] Christians, the original Christians did
[43:38] not even take the cross as a symbol. It
[43:40] was Constantine who did it, right? Uh
[43:43] Peter and Paul and these men didn't walk
[43:45] around with crosses. That came up from
[43:48] Constantine, the Roman Catholics. So,
[43:51] but yet we have them all over our
[43:52] churches. And if we going to what I'm
[43:55] saying to you is I'm cautioning those
[43:57] who took what I said and think you can
[43:59] weaponize it against Israel. Don't be
[44:01] hypocrites, man. You know there's so
[44:03] many of of of Christian symbology that
[44:06] comes from paganism and you need to be
[44:08] aware of that.
[44:10] Uh my church knows that I have done
[44:13] extensive teachings using diagrams that
[44:15] include the pyramid and the capstone.
[44:17] Right? So if you look at message people
[44:20] do you know that pyramids are tied into
[44:23] paganism and other religious sects? I
[44:26] remember very early in my ministry, I
[44:28] was given a like a scrolled uh parchment
[44:31] by a brother who had showed me the
[44:33] teachings of a certain Christian sect
[44:35] that just use pyramids. And this was
[44:38] where they um they um uh accused the
[44:42] prophet of being part of this cult. Uh
[44:45] they call it the pyramid cult because he
[44:47] used the pyramid to teach the church
[44:49] ages and statue of a perfect man. Right?
[44:52] So because the pyramid is linked to
[44:55] paganism, does it mean we should not use
[44:58] it to teach? Does it mean we are paganis
[45:01] paganistic in our teaching? Does it mean
[45:03] we are a cult? Does it mean we are evil
[45:05] because we use a shape that was once
[45:07] used by pagans,
[45:09] right? Obviously not. So why do that to
[45:12] Israel? Why take advantage and try and
[45:14] go after Israel? I don't understand.
[45:16] That was not my intention. Uh do you
[45:19] know that
[45:21] um even the name Elohim was not a Hebrew
[45:26] name. It was a Elohim is a Canaanitish
[45:29] word which Abraham learned when he moved
[45:32] from the Chaldes to Canaan. Uh they were
[45:35] already using the language and Elohim is
[45:38] a plural meaning gods. The singular is
[45:41] Aloa or Aloy. Uh, and if if that name
[45:46] comes from paganism from from Canaanitiz
[45:49] languages, why do we use it? God didn't
[45:52] even give anybody that that name to use.
[45:54] It was used because like if you read in
[45:56] the Bible in the in in the Torah when it
[45:59] says it in the Hebrew, I am the Lord
[46:01] your God. You shall have no other gods
[46:03] beside me. It reads, I am Adoni, your
[46:06] Elohim. You shall have no other Elohim
[46:09] besides me. Elohim was not a word
[46:12] specifically only allocated to Yahweh or
[46:15] Jehovah. Elohim is a Canaanites word
[46:18] which means gods or judges, right? And
[46:21] yet, so why criticize the star of David?
[46:24] Why criticize everything else when so
[46:27] much of what we use uh is also in common
[46:30] with many paganistic things. So there
[46:33] needs to be wisdom people uh when
[46:36] dealing with these things. And there are
[46:37] other believers and Christians who are
[46:38] falling now into the trap to persecute
[46:41] Israel who get caught up in internet
[46:43] soothing and believe that you know
[46:45] everything they read in the internet.
[46:46] One of the things they claim is that the
[46:48] six-pointed star is a star of Renfan as
[46:51] spoken of by Steven in the book of acts.
[46:54] The truth is and I don't want to get
[46:56] into all the history of it but the truth
[46:59] is there's no evidence of that. Right?
[47:01] You can go and you'll watch YouTube
[47:03] stuff and read stuff from the internet.
[47:05] Please be careful. Uh, of course we know
[47:09] Stephen didn't make that up. Suck it out
[47:12] of his thumb or you know you out of thin
[47:15] air. Steven was quoting Amos 5 26. And
[47:19] if you go and read Amos 5:26, it doesn't
[47:22] say Reman. It says Kun C H I N, which is
[47:27] most probably the Greek god Saturn. And
[47:31] u maybe that's what it was referring to.
[47:34] Uh h how do we know that uh uh uh Steven
[47:38] was referring to the six-pointed star?
[47:40] There's no evidence of that. We don't
[47:42] know that. There's just people who hate
[47:44] Israel who try and do that. So just
[47:48] don't fall into the trap, people. Don't
[47:50] don't take the bait. Right? These things
[47:52] were made up hundreds of years later by
[47:55] people who just hate Israel and say,
[47:57] "You see here the Bible says it and
[47:58] Steven calls him out." Don't listen to
[48:00] that. Don't get caught up in this
[48:02] nonsense. It doesn't matter how people
[48:04] want to identify themselves or use
[48:06] symbols. It means nothing because the
[48:09] symbols themselves have no power. People
[48:12] give it power by making too much of
[48:15] something. So I hope you understand my
[48:17] stance on this in terms of the quotes
[48:19] that we me that were mentioned.
[48:22] The prophet talking about the pyramid
[48:24] and the star of David descending upon it
[48:26] where he wanted to preach a message
[48:28] called descending star. though to me
[48:32] those are the only two quotes there the
[48:34] um in 1965 where he mentions that he
[48:36] expresses wanting to uh speak on that
[48:40] and to me it's very simple like I showed
[48:42] you in in the diagram the star of David
[48:44] to me is Christ it's incredible it's the
[48:48] Messiah right it's it's a God and man
[48:52] joined and and obviously if you have
[48:54] humanity which is this pyramid and you
[48:57] knock the cap off the only thing that
[48:59] can perfect humanity is the Messiah, the
[49:02] star of David, the word made flesh.
[49:04] That's what I see when I look at it.
[49:06] Obviously, you're not thinking of a
[49:08] literal star of David u descending upon
[49:12] a literal pyramid. That's just
[49:13] symbology, right? So, I believe that the
[49:16] prophet was meaning that the star of
[49:18] David is actually the Messiah. It is
[49:20] Christ. It is the the the God man, the
[49:23] Messiah. In terms of revelation, it
[49:25] means the pyramid representing the
[49:27] gentile church which can only be
[49:30] perfected, completed or kept by the
[49:33] revelation of Christ which is God
[49:37] becoming man and man becoming God. That
[49:40] is the revelation and the mystery of God
[49:42] through Christ. That's what I believe. I
[49:45] do not set value on symbols or
[49:48] talismans. It it is against our faith
[49:51] and it is against the faith of the open
[49:52] book. That is not who we are. Amen. I
[49:56] trust that you understand that. Okay.
[49:59] So, question two. Uh question two is a
[50:02] very uh interesting question and I I
[50:05] don't know if I should take too much of
[50:07] time on it, but it is how do we study
[50:10] the message and the Bible to understand
[50:12] it the way it should be? So, I actually
[50:17] tweaked this question a little bit to to
[50:20] make it sound a little easier to
[50:22] understand, but it was like more a case
[50:26] of
[50:28] like how do we study the message in the
[50:30] Bible to uh to understand things the
[50:34] right way the seventh seal should be
[50:37] interpreted or the open book should be
[50:40] interpreted and and it was more along
[50:42] those lines. So I I want to make this as
[50:46] simple as possible. Okay? I cannot tell
[50:49] you um
[50:52] um in what direction to study. Uh but I
[50:56] I I've always come back to this and I
[50:59] and I've been telling uh especially the
[51:01] young people, new people in these times,
[51:07] start with the rock of your day. I've
[51:10] been saying this regularly. You must
[51:12] have a rock. Rock means an anchor. You
[51:15] must have an anchor. You must know what
[51:18] the foundation of your faith is for your
[51:21] day. And and here's a surprising thing.
[51:23] When I speak to message people and and
[51:26] young people, they don't know what their
[51:28] foundation is. And a lot of them, if you
[51:30] ask them what their foundation is,
[51:32] they'll give you some theological answer
[51:34] or some Christian answer like our rock
[51:37] is Christ. Wonderful. What does that
[51:39] mean? you know what is your foundation
[51:42] for your day and and the foundation what
[51:45] is a foundation is a foundation is
[51:47] something you build on so what is it
[51:49] that you are building on right and um so
[51:52] what I what I say to you is don't study
[51:56] the Bible and the message to figure out
[51:59] what it means that's the wrong way
[52:02] because then you're going to you're
[52:03] going to go into interpretation
[52:06] and so the right thing to to have happen
[52:10] is that the Holy Ghost, the person of
[52:12] the Holy Spirit for your day must reveal
[52:15] to you what your foundation is. When you
[52:18] receive the Holy Ghost, the person of
[52:20] Christ must reveal to you what your
[52:24] foundation is. You must know what is
[52:27] your rock. Right? So very quickly,
[52:32] what is the foundation of the message
[52:33] today?
[52:35] Why are we in this message? What is this
[52:36] message about? If if our rock is Christ
[52:39] and that's it, why are we not in a
[52:42] Pentecostal church? Because they believe
[52:44] Christ died, shed his blood for our
[52:47] sins, rose again, giving us the hope of
[52:49] a resurrection, and promised us he will
[52:51] return uh in his second coming to take
[52:54] us away to heaven. That's the foundation
[52:56] of the faith of all Christians.
[53:00] What is your foundation as the message,
[53:03] right? Our foundation
[53:07] is that man was created to be God on
[53:11] this earth from Genesis chapter 1 and
[53:14] Genesis chapter 2. Man sinned by taking
[53:18] his own will and lost that inheritance.
[53:23] So that's where our foundation begins,
[53:26] right? And our foundation is that in
[53:29] this day, the message of the hour is
[53:34] Christ being revealed to us to restore
[53:38] back to us what Adam lost in the
[53:40] beginning.
[53:42] So restoring to us what Adam lost in the
[53:46] beginning is a lot different to just a
[53:49] Pentecostal message of Christ dying and
[53:52] the hope of the resurrection. The hope
[53:54] of the resurrection is a stepping stone
[53:57] to what our foundation is today. Every
[54:01] single age had its foundation, had
[54:04] something that it had to build on. You
[54:06] have a foundation. So a lot of people in
[54:09] the message think, well, our foundation
[54:10] is the prophet of the hour. Malachi 45
[54:13] and 6. He was only the appearing. He was
[54:16] only the the forerunner, the appearing
[54:18] of the Lord. He was introducing the
[54:20] coming. So what is the foundation? What
[54:23] is it that we as people of the open book
[54:27] believe today? So this is what I'm
[54:30] telling you.
[54:32] Do you believe that you are supposed to
[54:35] be the word made flesh in this day?
[54:41] Do you have the faith to believe that
[54:43] you have been chosen to be Christ
[54:46] manifested in flesh called the bride in
[54:50] this last day? If that is your
[54:53] foundation,
[54:54] what is it about the word in this day
[54:57] that brings that to pass? And how do you
[55:00] build up on that? So you you can't have
[55:03] that as your foundation and say the
[55:05] seventh seal is not open and you're
[55:07] still waiting for Christ to come in his
[55:10] corporal body to bring that to pass. You
[55:13] got to just be stuck in cood and keeping
[55:16] standards of the message, waiting for
[55:18] something to happen. You're not building
[55:21] on your foundation. So what I'm saying
[55:23] to you is when you read the seven seals,
[55:25] when you read the church ages and you
[55:28] have your anchor, your rock that you are
[55:30] building on is I am supposed to be the
[55:34] bride of Christ. The mystery of God
[55:36] revealed, made flesh in this day. The
[55:39] seventh seal has opened to bring God
[55:41] down to me. I am supposed to be heaven
[55:45] and earth embracing. The coming of the
[55:47] Lord has to do with me taking the book,
[55:50] eating the book and becoming Christ.
[55:52] That is the mystery under the seventh
[55:54] seal. That's going to be your rock. So
[55:56] when you when that is your rock and you
[55:59] go and read the seventh seal, you are
[56:01] not going to place the coming of the
[56:02] Lord in the future. You are not going to
[56:04] place 1 Thessalonians 4 and shout voice
[56:08] trump all in the future. You're not
[56:09] going to place seven thunders in the
[56:11] future. Immediately if your rock is that
[56:13] you are supposed to be Christ made flesh
[56:16] and that's the restoration bringing back
[56:18] what Adam lost then when you read the
[56:20] quotes you are going to see yourself in
[56:22] there so you have to have an anchor
[56:25] first you have to have a rock first and
[56:27] then you start to see things that will
[56:30] back that up and the Holy Spirit has to
[56:32] reveal that to you right so you can't
[56:35] just take the message and and look at it
[56:37] like a text and say let's go study this
[56:39] thing and see what it comes comes out
[56:41] with, let's take the thing as a theory
[56:45] and and and and make up some idea or
[56:48] prove from what he says. You're
[56:51] basically trying to get into the mind of
[56:53] the prophet, trying to deduce what he
[56:57] meant intellectually or by reasoning,
[57:01] uh, by tying this up with that and this
[57:04] with that and 65 with with 57 and 60
[57:09] with 63.
[57:11] You're going to go around in circles and
[57:14] you're going to form theories. You
[57:16] cannot do that. You cannot study that
[57:18] way as a minister. You cannot study that
[57:20] way. You have to have a rock. You have
[57:23] to be able to build on that rock as a
[57:26] man of the house, as a a husband of a
[57:29] family. You have to have a rock. You
[57:32] have to know what because you cannot
[57:34] have a purpose without a foundation. You
[57:36] you you can't drift. You can't drift
[57:39] waiting for something to catch you and
[57:41] then and then tell you, well, this is
[57:44] what I'm supposed to be or this is what
[57:45] it is. You personally have to meet God
[57:49] and find that rock. You have to believe
[57:51] in it. You I think there's an there's an
[57:54] actual quote where brother says, "If you
[57:56] don't receive the Holy Ghost and you're
[57:59] not born again, you're taking somebody
[58:01] else's word for it." That's a quote.
[58:04] You're taking somebody else's word for
[58:06] it. You have to meet him yourself and
[58:09] see it for yourself. So my advice to
[58:12] you, how do we study the message in the
[58:14] Bible? Have a rock first. You must have
[58:17] an experience with God. You must see the
[58:20] message for what it's come come to. You
[58:23] must have looked at the the message of
[58:25] the appearing where the prophet came in
[58:27] and preached through the first and
[58:28] second pools and taught us the church
[58:29] ages and water baptism, serpent seed.
[58:32] All that predestination,
[58:35] all of that should have led you up to
[58:37] the point where you are seeing Lord does
[58:40] this mean you have called me to be your
[58:44] bride to be married to this word to
[58:48] become you and you become me. Does this
[58:51] mean you have called me to be the
[58:53] fulfillment of John 14:20 that in that
[58:56] day you shall know I am in the father, I
[58:58] in you, you in me and we are one. Is
[59:01] this that day? You must come to the
[59:03] understanding that you have been
[59:05] baptized with water, baptized with the
[59:06] Holy Ghost, given the word, given the
[59:09] open book so that you can bring this to
[59:11] pass. You have to know that. You cannot
[59:14] study this message just like some
[59:16] theory. You have to know that and
[59:18] believe that so that when you believe
[59:20] that with all your heart, you study the
[59:23] message, you will see yourself in there.
[59:26] You will not see what other people are
[59:28] trying to see by trying to study it and
[59:31] figure things out. You are going I know
[59:34] this because no you know this is my
[59:37] personal experience as well but every
[59:40] brother I know who has seen the open
[59:42] book.
[59:44] Whoever sends me quotes it pops out at
[59:46] them. Look at this brother L. Look at
[59:48] what this says. Look at what this this
[59:50] is it. This is the seventh seal. This is
[59:52] the opening of the word. This is me.
[59:53] Listen, they can't help seeing it. They
[59:56] can't help. The Holy Ghost is putting
[59:59] things together for them because they
[1:00:01] have a rock. And you have to have that
[1:00:04] rock. You can be a young person, old
[1:00:06] person. Doesn't matter who you are,
[1:00:07] where you're from. If you have that
[1:00:10] rock, he's going to reveal it to you.
[1:00:12] He's going to lead you to the right
[1:00:13] things you need for the season of your
[1:00:16] life. Amen. I trust that's quite clear
[1:00:21] to you. So, I want to get to question
[1:00:22] three. I love question three. I was
[1:00:26] speaking to a young person last week and
[1:00:29] uh this question came up. What does it
[1:00:31] mean to be born of water and of spirit?
[1:00:35] Obviously, this question is inspired by
[1:00:38] the series we've been doing on the Holy
[1:00:40] Ghost and the question and answers and
[1:00:42] it's leading us to more beautiful
[1:00:44] questions. So, uh what does it mean to
[1:00:47] be born of water and of spirit? So I
[1:00:50] want to begin by reading this um
[1:00:52] scripture from where it hails.
[1:00:56] Uh John 3:3-5. And all of you know this.
[1:00:59] This is where Nicodemus comes to speak
[1:01:01] to Christ. Nicodemus came by night.
[1:01:03] Right? Jesus answered and said unto him,
[1:01:06] that is to Nicodemus, verily, verily, I
[1:01:09] say unto thee, except a man be born
[1:01:11] again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
[1:01:15] All right. Beautiful.
[1:01:17] You cannot see the kingdom of God. That
[1:01:20] means you cannot understand the
[1:01:22] mysteries
[1:01:24] of God revealed unless you are born
[1:01:27] again. Okay, so watch that statement.
[1:01:30] Now verse four, Nicodemus said unto him,
[1:01:33] how can a man be born when he is old?
[1:01:36] Can he enter the second time into his
[1:01:38] mother's womb and be born? So Nicodemus
[1:01:40] seems to like what we were speaking
[1:01:41] about on Sunday, like a reset, right? To
[1:01:44] be born again. He's saying, "You mean
[1:01:46] how do I get a second chance? How do I
[1:01:48] go back and not repeat the old mistakes
[1:01:51] and uh you know uh come back again as a
[1:01:54] baby and and redo this and do this right
[1:01:57] the second time?" And Jesus answered,
[1:01:59] "Verily, verily, I say unto thee, except
[1:02:02] a man be born of water and of the
[1:02:06] spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom
[1:02:09] of God." So you take verse 5 and verse
[1:02:12] three and superimpose them. To be born
[1:02:15] again is to be born of water and of
[1:02:18] spirit. To see the mysteries of God is
[1:02:23] to enter the kingdom of God. Right? So
[1:02:26] there are those two superimposed. So
[1:02:29] when you read that verse verse five
[1:02:33] where he says except a man be born of
[1:02:35] water and of the spirit he cannot enter
[1:02:37] the kingdom of God.
[1:02:40] This is the one of the reasons why the
[1:02:42] prophet said if you don't get the
[1:02:44] eastern view of the Bible you're not
[1:02:47] going to understand us properly. In fact
[1:02:48] he says when you get the eastern view of
[1:02:51] the Bible the Bible becomes a new book
[1:02:54] to you. right now. We would never
[1:02:57] understand there there isn't a single
[1:03:00] Gentile who would understand what it
[1:03:02] means to be born of water and of spirit
[1:03:05] because it's not a gentile thing. There
[1:03:07] may there may have been some
[1:03:09] similarities later, but this was very
[1:03:12] much a Hebrew thing. We would never have
[1:03:16] understood this had we not had the
[1:03:18] Hebrews to look to. Firstly, when Christ
[1:03:21] was speaking to Nicodemus, who was a
[1:03:25] a Pharisee, a a Hebrew priest, telling
[1:03:29] him about the new birth or what it means
[1:03:33] to be born again. And Nicodemus
[1:03:35] questions that. And Christ explains that
[1:03:38] to be born again, you don't have to go
[1:03:40] back into your mother's womb. You just
[1:03:42] have to be born of water and of spirit.
[1:03:44] And Nicodemus understood what being born
[1:03:48] of water means because if you continue
[1:03:50] reading, he doesn't question him about
[1:03:53] being born of water. Nicodemus seems to
[1:03:55] understand that. He just later on he
[1:03:57] says, "How can these things be?" And so
[1:04:00] this was the first time Nicodemus was
[1:04:02] hearing being born of the spirit, right?
[1:04:06] And u he understood what what being born
[1:04:10] of water meant. He he understood that to
[1:04:13] mean to mean baptism of water but he
[1:04:16] didn't understand what baptism of spirit
[1:04:18] means obviously because the holy ghost
[1:04:21] had not yet come. So baptism that's
[1:04:24] where we start right baptism was
[1:04:26] instituted in Levitical law and over
[1:04:29] time became a Jewish tradition. So, you
[1:04:33] know, I could be speaking this year and
[1:04:36] there'll be people who say, "Brother
[1:04:37] Alistister, you know, come on. We we're
[1:04:39] we're seasoned saints. You know, uh we
[1:04:42] we're seasoned children of God. We don't
[1:04:44] need to be talking about baptism again."
[1:04:46] This is the amazing part to me is that
[1:04:49] you can be baptized. You can even have
[1:04:51] the Holy Ghost. But you know, uh you you
[1:04:55] can't a lot of people just coasting
[1:04:57] through life do not appreciate the
[1:05:01] experience or even understand.
[1:05:05] A lot of people today and the prophet
[1:05:08] said to us, they don't have the baptism
[1:05:11] of the Holy Ghost. They don't know why.
[1:05:13] A lot of people struggle to receive it.
[1:05:15] A lot of them people think they have it
[1:05:16] and don't have it. Right? So, a lot of
[1:05:20] people just get baptized in a church
[1:05:22] because they believe that's what they
[1:05:23] must do. A lot of people get baptized
[1:05:25] because they feel like the rapture is
[1:05:27] going to take place and they better be
[1:05:28] baptized because if they're not
[1:05:29] baptized, they won't make it in. A lot
[1:05:31] of people believe they must get baptized
[1:05:33] to receive the Holy Ghost. If they don't
[1:05:35] receive the Holy Ghost or they don't get
[1:05:37] baptized, they won't receive the Holy
[1:05:38] Ghost. Uh, and of course, we know in
[1:05:41] scripture, people receive the Holy Ghost
[1:05:43] without even being waterbaptized.
[1:05:45] So um people and and I see even in the
[1:05:50] newer generations especially do not know
[1:05:54] about it and don't appreciate it the
[1:05:57] depth and the the value of it. Right? So
[1:06:00] the Lord Jesus began to teach that from
[1:06:04] the earliest in his ministry. In fact,
[1:06:06] John the Baptist uh was the one who
[1:06:08] began by saying that he is going to come
[1:06:12] or I baptize you with water and but when
[1:06:15] he comes, he's going to baptize you with
[1:06:18] zeal
[1:06:20] uh and with fire, right?
[1:06:23] Uh but I want to read you can you can
[1:06:26] read about it in the Gospels, but I want
[1:06:27] to read Acts chapter 1 verse 5 uh for
[1:06:31] you.
[1:06:33] And um here this was Peter
[1:06:37] uh speaking about saying for John truly
[1:06:39] baptized with water but you but um you
[1:06:43] shall be baptiz oh sorry this is Christ
[1:06:45] speaking for John truly baptized with
[1:06:47] water but you shall be baptized with the
[1:06:49] Holy Ghost not many days hence. So watch
[1:06:52] this. John baptized with water but you
[1:06:56] shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:58] In other words, I will baptize you with
[1:06:59] the Holy Ghost. Right? Okay. So the
[1:07:02] question first question is what is
[1:07:04] baptized?
[1:07:06] Okay, what is the meaning of baptism?
[1:07:08] Baptism means to be like
[1:07:11] immersed in something like plunged into
[1:07:13] something and that's doing something.
[1:07:16] It's like being anointed in some way,
[1:07:19] right?
[1:07:21] So let's answer the question. Being born
[1:07:24] of water
[1:07:27] is being baptized with water. In other
[1:07:30] words, the new birth has two parts to
[1:07:32] it. The new birth has water baptism and
[1:07:37] baptism of spirit. It's going to take
[1:07:39] that that's going to be two components
[1:07:42] of the new birth, right? And it starts
[1:07:45] with water baptism. And water baptism is
[1:07:49] a an outward expression of being born of
[1:07:54] water. What is water baptism about? What
[1:07:57] is the significance? It is about
[1:07:59] repentance and physical outward
[1:08:03] experience. Okay. What does it signify?
[1:08:07] Water baptism signified separating
[1:08:10] yourself from sin. You making a decision
[1:08:14] to separate yourself from sin. It it
[1:08:17] represents repentance which means a
[1:08:20] change of mind and it represents
[1:08:23] consecration
[1:08:25] right to something. In other words,
[1:08:27] being set apart from the world and being
[1:08:30] set apart for something else. It speaks
[1:08:33] of leaving a previous life path to begin
[1:08:37] a new life path. It also speaks of being
[1:08:41] inducted into a body of ministry. Now,
[1:08:44] where do we see this first? And that's
[1:08:46] what I'm going to show you. I'm going to
[1:08:48] make this very simple so you can
[1:08:49] understand this by the Levitical Lord.
[1:08:53] So we first see this in Exodus 29 and
[1:08:56] verse4.
[1:08:57] And Aaron his sons, thou Moses shall
[1:09:01] bring unto the door of the tabernacle of
[1:09:03] the congregation and shall wash them
[1:09:06] with water. Okay. So
[1:09:11] in the formation of the priesthood, the
[1:09:13] high priest and all the priests that is
[1:09:15] Aaron and his sons, right? What had to
[1:09:19] happen was they once they're dressed in
[1:09:22] linen, Moses has to bring them to the
[1:09:25] door of the tabernacle and wash them
[1:09:28] with the water from the brazen labor,
[1:09:30] the brass labor. He has to wash them.
[1:09:33] The prophet has to wash the high priest
[1:09:36] and the priesthood, right? So washing by
[1:09:41] the prophet, what does this signify?
[1:09:43] This is baptism. What does this signify?
[1:09:45] It signifies that the word of the
[1:09:49] prophet
[1:09:50] brings true repentance and an exodus
[1:09:55] from an old life and uh to an old life
[1:10:00] and old works to a new life and new
[1:10:03] works. Right? So in other words, Aaron
[1:10:06] and his sons being baptized by the
[1:10:10] prophet is showing a connection to the
[1:10:14] word of the prophet.
[1:10:17] That's what baptism is. You don't just
[1:10:19] come and be baptized because you feel
[1:10:21] well the church does it. I I am doing
[1:10:24] that. No, you are showing a connection
[1:10:27] to the word of the prophet. You are you
[1:10:30] you are doing some kind of water baptism
[1:10:34] tradition but what its significance is
[1:10:38] you are showing a connection between you
[1:10:42] and the word of the prophet. Okay this
[1:10:45] connected Aaron and uh his sons to the
[1:10:50] word of the prophet when po because they
[1:10:53] didn't know God except through what
[1:10:55] Moses told them. So when Paul spoke to
[1:10:58] the people, he asked them, "Unto what
[1:11:02] then were you baptized, right? He wasn't
[1:11:05] talking about the water." Okay, let's
[1:11:08] let's just read this and I can explain
[1:11:10] this. So beautiful.
[1:11:12] Acts 19 2-4. And Paul's he said unto
[1:11:16] them, "Have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:11:18] since you believed?" And they said unto
[1:11:20] him, "We have not so much as heard
[1:11:22] whether there be any Holy Ghost."
[1:11:24] So, so in other words, did you receive
[1:11:27] the Holy Ghost since you believe and
[1:11:29] there we don't even know what the Holy
[1:11:31] Ghost is, right? If someone tells you
[1:11:33] that
[1:11:35] uh we haven't received the Holy Ghost,
[1:11:37] what's your next question, right? Paul
[1:11:40] goes straight to this.
[1:11:42] Unto what then were you baptized? In
[1:11:46] other words, what water baptism did you
[1:11:49] have? In other words, he's saying, "You
[1:11:52] have not received the Holy Ghost because
[1:11:54] of what you were baptized." Because of
[1:11:56] what you were baptized unto,
[1:11:59] right? And they said, "Unto John's
[1:12:01] baptism." So, I want to point out what
[1:12:03] is wrong with John's baptism.
[1:12:05] Christ was baptized by John. Many other
[1:12:07] people were baptized by John. He's not
[1:12:09] saying John's baptism was a wrong
[1:12:12] baptism.
[1:12:13] It was this exactly the same action.
[1:12:17] Paul was going to baptize these people.
[1:12:18] You're going to take them the same way,
[1:12:20] put them under the water, probably the
[1:12:22] Jordan River, probably the same water
[1:12:25] John the Baptist did in same action, not
[1:12:28] dipping them in three times or
[1:12:30] sprinkling them. Probably the exactly
[1:12:32] the same thing. And now they're going to
[1:12:33] come out and receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:12:35] Why?
[1:12:38] Why? Because it's not about the water.
[1:12:41] It's about the word they were being
[1:12:44] connected with. They were going to
[1:12:46] receive the Holy Ghost based on the word
[1:12:49] they were connected to. Right? So then
[1:12:52] said Paul, John verily baptized with the
[1:12:55] baptism of repentance, saying unto the
[1:12:57] people that they should believe on him
[1:13:00] which should come after him that is on
[1:13:02] Jesus Christ. And next the next verse
[1:13:04] says when they heard this they were
[1:13:07] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:13:10] and they received the Holy Ghost. So
[1:13:13] what was Paul's questioning?
[1:13:16] What then were you baptized unto?
[1:13:19] And they said John's baptism. They
[1:13:22] identified their water baptism by the
[1:13:26] prophet John. Do you get it? John's
[1:13:30] ministry was about introducing the
[1:13:32] Messiah. Paul's ministry was about
[1:13:35] revealing the Messiah. So they would
[1:13:39] receive the Holy Ghost for their day
[1:13:41] based on the word for their day. So they
[1:13:44] were first baptized unto John's baptism.
[1:13:49] Now they were going to be baptized unto
[1:13:51] Paul's baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:13:53] Christ. John baptized unto u repentance
[1:13:58] in the name of Jehovah. repentance of
[1:14:00] sins in recognizing, in other words, he
[1:14:03] was telling them, he was preaching the
[1:14:04] word, repent now, be baptized, set aside
[1:14:08] yourself from the sin of the world, make
[1:14:11] your lives right because the Messiah is
[1:14:13] about to come and you are going to
[1:14:14] receive the Messiah. Paul's message was
[1:14:16] the Messiah has come and has and has
[1:14:20] died and rose again and uh we are going
[1:14:23] to receive that the Holy Ghost what he
[1:14:25] has promised and that is the word of
[1:14:27] this day and you need to be baptized
[1:14:29] according to the word of this day right
[1:14:32] so they now had to be baptized according
[1:14:34] to Paul's baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:14:36] Christ so when they got the full
[1:14:38] revelation of what Paul preached they
[1:14:42] received the Holy Ghost
[1:14:44] nothing wrong with John's baptism. It's
[1:14:47] just not the word for their day. So, a
[1:14:51] lot of people in the message are
[1:14:52] baptized unto God sent a prophet and the
[1:14:57] first two pulls and they don't see the
[1:15:00] opening of the seventh seal.
[1:15:02] Do you get it? Why have you not received
[1:15:06] the Holy Ghost? Why have you not
[1:15:08] received the open books since you
[1:15:10] believed? That's the question today.
[1:15:13] Why? because you are you were baptized
[1:15:16] unto God sent a prophet and the first
[1:15:18] two pulls. Today is another day. You
[1:15:21] have to be baptized unto the third pull.
[1:15:24] Now
[1:15:26] stop. Don't misinterpret what I'm
[1:15:28] saying. I'm not saying today you must be
[1:15:32] rebaptized. If you were baptized 30
[1:15:34] years ago on the message, you must now
[1:15:35] come and be rebaptized. No. This is
[1:15:37] about an individual spiritual
[1:15:39] experience. What I'm trying to say to
[1:15:40] you is people today are not receiving
[1:15:43] the Holy Ghost because in their minds
[1:15:46] they are connected to a word of God sent
[1:15:49] the prophet and the first two polls
[1:15:52] signs and wonders the miracles of the
[1:15:54] prophet the um the testimonies of the
[1:15:56] prophet the um
[1:15:59] uh water baptism godhead so and seed and
[1:16:02] so on coods keep the ABCs that's it
[1:16:05] that's the word they are baptized unto
[1:16:09] That is the word they are connected to.
[1:16:11] They are refusing to be connected to the
[1:16:13] revelation of the seventh seal. They are
[1:16:16] and and that is why you are not going to
[1:16:19] succeed. You are not going to receive
[1:16:21] the gift of the Holy Ghost for you today
[1:16:23] that's required for the purpose of this
[1:16:25] day. You are just going to remain a
[1:16:27] message church member who's most likely
[1:16:29] going to denominate around God and a
[1:16:32] prophet. That's what's going to happen,
[1:16:34] right?
[1:16:35] You have to be baptized. You have to be
[1:16:38] connected to the word for this day. It
[1:16:42] will directly connect you with the word.
[1:16:44] So you must first truly for you to be
[1:16:48] able to do this saints to be connected
[1:16:49] to the word of the third Paul you must
[1:16:52] be willing to repent of old ideas, old
[1:16:56] traditions, old doctrines. You must be
[1:16:59] willing to make a change. Amen. That is
[1:17:02] being born of water.
[1:17:05] Repentance. All right, let's go to being
[1:17:08] born of the spirit. Now, what is born of
[1:17:10] the spirit and where do we find that in
[1:17:12] the Old Testament? Once again, it's with
[1:17:14] Aaron, right? So, let's go to Exodus 29,
[1:17:19] uh, verse 19 to 21. We're almost
[1:17:21] closing.
[1:17:24] Exodus 29:21.
[1:17:26] And thou shalt take the other ram, and
[1:17:29] Aaron and his sons shall put their hands
[1:17:31] upon the head of the ram. Then you shall
[1:17:33] kill the ram, take off his blood, put it
[1:17:36] upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron,
[1:17:39] the right uh and the right ear of his
[1:17:41] sons, and upon the thumb of their right
[1:17:43] hand, and upon the great toe of their
[1:17:44] right foot. In other words, their entire
[1:17:47] body touched with the blood of the
[1:17:50] sacrifice. And then you take the that
[1:17:54] same blood and sprinkle the blood upon
[1:17:56] the altar round about. Notice not around
[1:18:00] the whole tabernacle, around the altar.
[1:18:04] Uh verse 21. And thou shalt take of the
[1:18:07] blood that is upon the altar
[1:18:10] and of the anointing oil, the blood
[1:18:12] mixed with the oil, and sprinkle it upon
[1:18:15] Aaron and upon his garments and upon his
[1:18:19] sons and upon the garments of his sons
[1:18:22] with him. And he shall be hallowed that
[1:18:26] is made holy or consecrated
[1:18:29] and his garments and his sons and his
[1:18:32] sons garments with him.
[1:18:35] Oh, this is beautiful. Right? So what is
[1:18:38] this? This is born of spirit. This is
[1:18:41] anointing of blood and oil. So they were
[1:18:44] washed by the prophet with water. That's
[1:18:47] water baptism. Now they are anointed by
[1:18:50] blood and oil. What is that? The one
[1:18:52] connects you to the word of the prophet.
[1:18:55] This connects you to the sacrifice and
[1:18:58] the tabernacle.
[1:19:00] The priesthood is connected to the altar
[1:19:02] of sacrifice and the sacrifice and the
[1:19:05] tabernacle. What is this? This is
[1:19:08] connection to the purpose of God and
[1:19:11] connection to God himself. Okay. How so?
[1:19:16] The blood symbolized connecting them to
[1:19:18] the sacrificial altar and the sacrifice
[1:19:21] itself that is in the outer court. The
[1:19:24] oil in the blood connected them to the
[1:19:26] inner court and the most holy place. The
[1:19:29] oil connected them to the service of the
[1:19:32] people and to God. Without that oil
[1:19:36] which which was in the holy place
[1:19:39] without that they could not be connected
[1:19:41] to the candlesticks. They could not be
[1:19:42] connected to the most holy place. They
[1:19:44] could not enter in there. The the blood
[1:19:46] of the sacrifice connected them to the
[1:19:48] altar and their their bodies and their
[1:19:52] clothes were hallowed, meaning they
[1:19:55] could only work for the tabernacle.
[1:20:00] Aaron could not go have some side
[1:20:02] business. The clothes that he was
[1:20:04] wearing, the clothes of the priesthood
[1:20:06] was only to be used for the tabernacle
[1:20:10] and for the worship of God.
[1:20:12] He could not go use that for some
[1:20:16] wedding function he went to or party or
[1:20:18] something or visiting his friends. He
[1:20:21] had to use those garments. They were
[1:20:23] hallowed for the worship in the
[1:20:25] tabernacle. Right? So because Christ was
[1:20:29] abolishing the old worship and bringing
[1:20:32] in the new, bringing a new sacrifice, a
[1:20:35] new tabernacle, a new worship, a new
[1:20:38] priesthood. Hebrews the book of Hebrews
[1:20:40] 9 and10
[1:20:41] uh the baptism of water changed the
[1:20:44] washing of water by the word
[1:20:47] changed right and uh washing of water
[1:20:51] was given to all who repented and the
[1:20:54] Holy Ghost was was given to all who
[1:20:56] would believe. So the baptism connects
[1:21:00] you to the word that is preached the the
[1:21:03] baptism of water. The baptism of the
[1:21:05] Holy Ghost connects you to God himself
[1:21:08] and the purpose of God for your day.
[1:21:12] Amen. That is what it means to be
[1:21:14] baptized of water and baptized by the
[1:21:17] Holy Ghost. One connects you to the word
[1:21:20] that you say you believe in. The one
[1:21:22] connects you to God himself and the
[1:21:25] purpose for your day. Why do I need the
[1:21:28] Holy Ghost? because without the Holy
[1:21:30] Ghost I won't know what to do with the
[1:21:32] word that I have and be uh for it to be
[1:21:35] applied to my life today. I want to
[1:21:37] close with this quote from this man
[1:21:39] church age message.
[1:21:42] The prophet says what is the baptism
[1:21:45] with the Holy Ghost? It is the spirit
[1:21:48] baptizing you into the body of Christ.
[1:21:50] It is the new birth. It is the spirit of
[1:21:54] God coming in and filling you after you
[1:21:56] have repented. That's water baptism,
[1:21:59] right? After you have repented, after
[1:22:02] you've had baptism of water, the spirit
[1:22:04] of God coming in filling you, having
[1:22:07] heard his word and being baptized in
[1:22:11] water as an answer of good conscience
[1:22:14] toward God. Amen. The baptism of the
[1:22:18] Holy Ghost is that anointing of God, the
[1:22:22] spirit of God coming upon you after you
[1:22:24] have repented, after you have been
[1:22:26] baptized of water. That is the new
[1:22:28] birth. Praise be to God. Saints, there's
[1:22:31] so much more we could add to that, but I
[1:22:33] trust that the Lord will take that and
[1:22:35] give you better understanding. And if
[1:22:37] you have been baptized, you receive the
[1:22:39] Holy Ghost, make it more meaningful to
[1:22:40] you so that you can share it with other
[1:22:42] people. You can talk about these things.
[1:22:44] You can enjoy these things together.
[1:22:46] Teach your young children who want to be
[1:22:49] baptized and make it more meaningful.
[1:22:51] Make them understand what this really is
[1:22:53] about. So, the Lord bless you. Until we
[1:22:55] meet again, God be with you. God bless
[1:22:58] you and your families. Amen.
