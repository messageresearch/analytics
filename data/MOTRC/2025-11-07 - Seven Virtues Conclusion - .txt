TRANSCRIPT
========================================
When people look at these seven virtues and this is why I'm I want to show you in closing conclude this this out is that people who thought that this is the seven thunders and these were seven mysteries seven so mysterious things faith virtue knowledge temp they're so mysterious they had to be spoken by the thunders and why it's wrong is because these are not natures of God &gt;&gt; they are the original nature of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That was corrupted and have to be restored before the capstone descends on you. &gt;&gt; In other words, had there been no sin, you would have possessed them &gt;&gt; in whatever was necessary. &gt;&gt; Right? So, what is faith? This isn't the faith of God that framed the worlds. &gt;&gt; Everybody has faith. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, some of you people with anxiety, you also have faith. Maybe a little, but you have some, right? You trust in your anxiousness. You have faith in your anxiety to keep you safe. &gt;&gt; That's still faith. Faith is is a is something that men have, men and women have to make them believe in something without evidence. All of you do that. All of you use that. All of you exercise that. Am I right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And it's in everything you do, you exercise a little bit of faith. Not one of you will say to me, "Well, I was sick and there was this cough mixture and I spent a whole year studying it before I bought it." Nobody. You will hear, you will call a friend, you will call a relative, you will listen to the doctor. You hear what the doctor says. You will even make the stupid decision based on how the doctor smiled. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the doctor said, "Don't worry. Trust me. I've been a doctor for 50 years. This works." And you'll be like looking at your husband 50 years. He must know what he's talking about. Let's buy it based on that or this one or I saw this on YouTube. I saw this on Tik Tok or that or that. Please do not tell me you've done due diligence and done all the investigations necessary. At some point your investigations ran out and you took it by faith, &gt;&gt; right? Everybody, every human acts majority of the time on faith &gt;&gt; because nobody has the time to go find all the evidence. &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's not faith, it's just hoping. Let's take it and hope it works. Right? The point is there are natures of man that has been corrupted. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Even faith itself is corrupted &gt;&gt; because faith in the wrong thing is corrupt faith. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Like people who will actually trust in a lie and stake their claim on a lie. &gt;&gt; They have had corrupted faith. They were unable to see through the lie and recognize that they need to to change their idea about this. Right? So all those attributes they are attributes of man. Virtue is an attribute of man. Knowledge is an attribute of man. Temperance is an attribute of man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why does God need temperance? Temperance is self-control. Why is that a godly attribute? Self-control. Does God ever need self-control? Does God ever need patience? H Does God need to exercise patience? Come on, people. Is time affecting God? Oh, I need to endure. Does God need to endure? How about godliness? Does God need godliness? Huh? This is the this is the thing. So when we say they are attributes of the Holy Spirit or something like that, THE HOLY SPIRIT AGAIN IS SOMETHING RELATED to man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, so first before we get to the actual divine attribute meant to cap mankind, you have to have all those other attributes restored to its original. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what the building blocks are about. We've got to have true faith in the right thing. How could you have faith unless Christ was born, died, and rose again? How could you have faith toward true righteousness unless God became a man and showed you what true faith is? &gt;&gt; How could you have faith in a word unless that word was tested? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So, here's what happened. In the garden of Eden, man was once divine in the flesh. He was divine. He had the nature that was fit to rule. This is important to understand which will tell us why they are not the seven thunders. They are divine human natures, not the celestial nature of God. Trust me, when we get through each one, like brother said, we'll take faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience. We'll get through each one. We'll study it out and then you can decide and tell me whether this is like a nature of God. Can you if he says add to your faith everyone starts there faith right? When you start off do you have the faith of God that framed the worlds do you? And at what point do you get it and then add to your faith virtue? None of us ever have the faith to create a planet. &gt;&gt; So that's not the faith you're looking to. &gt;&gt; I mean, you're barely struggling to have faith to create an outbuilding at the back of your house or a dog kennel nailed up perfectly at 90° angles or some kind of thing that you're creating at home. Not enough faith. Is that right? You know, I tell my kids, "Poor human society." I tell you, we got to We constantly have to reward ourselves with food. You know, uh, you know, I I bought the kennel, honey, I'm going to build a kennel. Because I bought it, I need to reward myself with food. Let's go have some cheesecake. You know, then I get through like quarter of it. Look how well I did. Let's have some more cheesecake cuz I'm doing so well. rewarding myself, giving myself some dopamine. Then I I finish the thing, but it's slightly skewed. Don't worry, honey. We still tried. Let's go have some cheesecake. [laughter] Hey, we've got to reward ourselves. No matter how good or bad we do, no matter what or how how things go, we must still reward ourselves. This is human nature. It's all messed up, right? This is important, saints. They are divine natures of human beings. God doesn't need godliness, patience or temperance. He is perfect. He is not part of time. &gt;&gt; He does not have to endure anything. He does not need to exercise patience. If if God became impatient with us, there's something wrong with him. Cuz how could he be impatient when he already knows we were going to do that? &gt;&gt; Amen. He's he's got fornowledge. So how can he have impatience? True. &gt;&gt; His endurance with us is not about his endurance. It's about our It's about his longsuffering because we are so complacent, right? God respects your choice. As a church, we are only safe and ready to completely destroy the enemy in the presence of our husband, Christ. In Eden, the woman fell in the absence of her capstone. &gt;&gt; She fell in the absence of her husband. &gt;&gt; So if you don't if you DON'T EVEN GET CAPPED with that capstone, all that you built up, you will still fall by. &gt;&gt; That's how we know it's not the seven thunders. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she had everything. She even had contact with the theophony. But in the absence of her husband, she was wooed by a different capstone that corrupted whatever nature she had and took it out, stripped it away from her. Which is why though you are built up by all the word of the messengers, the Holy Spirit has to seal that in and the capstone come on to perfect it. And now it's sealed in place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we are living in the day when the capstone has to descend. That's what the seven seal must do. Yes, &gt;&gt; it must become something personal to you that brings the capsule down, connects you to your husband. When he is present, then the virtue of God himself is produced in us. Divine agape love. But it is important that we go through the entire building process. Saints, to close us off, you couldn't have come out of Egypt, crossed over the Red Sea, and start having a revival that you were in the promised land. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you couldn't. You had to walk through the wilderness journey. You had to meet every step. You had to meet Kora Day. You had to meet uh the the waters of Mara. You had to go through the the quailes issue. You had to go through all the trials before you get to the place where you get into the promised land. You can't stop there and say, "Now I'm ready for the seventh seal to be open." That's why it's not even a global instantaneous happening. Each one of us are going through our steps, &gt;&gt; our own personal growth. &gt;&gt; And at that time, YOU CAN BE SITTING in the same church under our ministry. And I was preaching the seven seal 20 years ago. It doesn't mean because I preached it 20 years ago, you've got it. &gt;&gt; You still have to come through your personal growth UNTIL THAT WHICH I PREACHED 20 YEARS AGO becomes a reality to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we're not bringing messages to tell you you're you're slowing us down. You're not worth it. You're getting into slow. You're not getting into No. If we preach like that, it means we don't even understand what we're preaching. &gt;&gt; Everybody is growing according to how God is revealing himself to them. &gt;&gt; You don't ever have to worry about being behind someone &gt;&gt; or you only came into the message a few years ago. Trust me, we're not going anywhere without you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a beautiful part of this thing. I I often hear brothers, you know, tell me, wonderful, sincere brothers, ministers saying, you know, brother, how do we catch up? I don't even think of you having to catch up. What do what do you have to catch up with? How much we know or how we can teach something? All you have to do is listen, believe, and trust God. &gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT AND ACT on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't have to do anything. It'll testify for itself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He'll let it be known among men. Just let it become real to you. Listen to the word, believe it, and act on it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's where the church fails. I I've actually got quotes that I've, &gt;&gt; you know, going, Brother Man says, people believe. I think we read some of it on on Wednesday. People believe and stop there. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's the issue right now with the right now with message churches. That's the issue because we preach the word, we take you to camps, you get the Holy Ghost, and then we bring you to church and and you do nothing. &gt;&gt; You're never meant to do nothing. &gt;&gt; You have to act on the word &gt;&gt; because that is going to produce the virtue. The virtue that's going to lead you to the building blocks that builds you up to become that holy temple which he can cap. These are seven steps to perfection. Then he seals everything with the Holy Ghost at the end and brings his own divine nature, celestial heavenly divine nature which is the capstone to come down upon. Praise be to God. Let's bow our heads together. Amen.
