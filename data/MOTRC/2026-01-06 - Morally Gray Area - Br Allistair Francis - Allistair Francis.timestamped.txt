[0:00] All right, I want to get to this next
[0:02] part
[0:04] which I've called the morally gray area.
[0:09] Deception has become the modern and
[0:14] chosen way of life. There used to be a
[0:17] clear boundary between truth and lies
[0:20] once, but that is no more. We no longer
[0:25] have just the two categories of truth
[0:27] and lies, but we have this morally
[0:31] comfortable gray category of misleading
[0:35] statements and behaviors that is not
[0:38] actually the truth, but just falls short
[0:40] of a lie. Right? So, if you look at this
[0:43] diagram I've I've put up for you on the
[0:46] screen, you'll see I've put the black
[0:49] part as lies and the white part is
[0:52] truth. And when you combine lies and
[0:56] truth together, you get this morally
[0:58] gray area. Okay? So this is
[1:03] uh where humans today find themselves
[1:07] living and actually more good people
[1:11] find themselves living in this morally
[1:13] gray area.
[1:15] You know naturally bad people don't
[1:17] care. They can live in absolute total
[1:20] lies.
[1:22] Now you are
[1:24] highly intelligent beings today
[1:28] as compared with people
[1:30] a thousand years ago.
[1:32] You are even more so intelligent than
[1:36] previous generations of the past just of
[1:38] the recent past. You have greater access
[1:41] to information
[1:43] good and bad information and uh the
[1:46] previous uh you know information that
[1:48] the previous generation did not have.
[1:51] You have the message. You have the
[1:52] Bible. You have you have it on your
[1:54] phones, your tablets, your PCs. You have
[1:57] Wikipedia. You have search engines of
[2:00] all kinds. You have social media. You
[2:03] have greater access to Bible
[2:05] commentaries. Uh the world of your
[2:08] generation has become so liberal, so
[2:11] free with sinfulness that it is
[2:14] literally making the word of God seem
[2:15] like an extreme.
[2:18] So it's like to tell you not to dress in
[2:22] a sexually seductive way looks like an
[2:25] extreme. But just 200 years ago, women
[2:27] were dressing covered up. You know, not
[2:32] even 200, like 100 years ago, they were
[2:35] dressing all over the world. It wasn't
[2:38] it it wasn't even called message
[2:40] standards. It just simply was. This is
[2:42] how you dress. Men never ran around in
[2:45] shorts. Uh you know, they worked in the
[2:48] fields without their shirts and so on.
[2:51] But just a few hundred years ago,
[2:54] society knew truth. Today, if you go to
[2:59] our Durban beachfront, you're going to
[3:00] find scores and scores of naked people,
[3:04] right? And uh people just doing
[3:07] unrighteous things.
[3:10] Illegitimate children are going to be
[3:11] conceived. It's just it's insane what's
[3:15] going on. And because of how this
[3:19] generation has become so liberal,
[3:22] the word which is truth looks extreme,
[3:26] right? And it has forced you
[3:30] because because of that you are being
[3:32] forced to live in this gray area. And
[3:36] this gray area you are calling normal.
[3:40] So that
[3:42] We're living in this place so we can be
[3:44] accepted in the world and accepted in
[3:47] the message. And that's what I'm finding
[3:51] with message people today. You're
[3:53] finding it so stressful, so hard. And
[3:57] you know, I could tell you so many
[3:59] things. How do I go to uh my family's
[4:03] weddings and you know, I got to fit in.
[4:07] How can I go to my cousins parties and
[4:11] still be a believer? Uh listen, nobody's
[4:15] asking you to go there and stand there
[4:16] and start shouting out the word and
[4:18] condemning them and you know saying thus
[4:21] said the Lord, you're all going to hell,
[4:23] you know, and nobody's asking you to do
[4:25] that. That's behaving like a crazy
[4:27] person, right? But you don't have to
[4:32] uh start participating in worldliness
[4:34] just to fit in. And and I I find today,
[4:39] you know, I I don't know,
[4:43] people call me grumpy. I don't mind. But
[4:46] this is one of the reasons I I'm not
[4:48] going to be a person who goes somewhere
[4:51] and be something I'm not. I'm not going
[4:53] to go to some family function and act
[4:56] like them just to to make them feel
[4:58] good. I want to stand for the truth. I
[5:00] want to I'll be there. I'll shake their
[5:03] hands. I'll congratulate them. you know,
[5:05] well done on your marriage or well done
[5:07] on turning whatever 21 or something, but
[5:10] if you're gonna play worldly music, I'm
[5:12] not going to dance to it. I'm sorry.
[5:14] This is not who I am. I'm going to sit
[5:15] there and watch you dance and do all
[5:17] your stuff and whatever and I'll enjoy
[5:19] the food and I'll greet you and I'll be
[5:22] uh, you know, courteous and loving and,
[5:26] you know, hug all the relatives and but
[5:28] I'm not going to get involved. I'm not
[5:29] going to stand there and listen to
[5:31] filthy sexy jokes and uh, immoral
[5:34] things. I'm not going to laugh at your
[5:36] uh um uh filthy words. I'm not going to
[5:40] act like it's okay with me. I'm not
[5:43] going to sit there while you curse and
[5:46] be vulgar and and make you feel happy
[5:48] that you know it's okay. I can deal with
[5:51] that. I'm a cool guy. No, I'm not going
[5:53] to do that. I'm going to be me. You be
[5:56] you. I be me. This is how it is. And um
[6:00] you don't care about making me feel
[6:02] uncomfortable.
[6:04] Why should I go out of my way to make
[6:06] you feel like you're like you're like
[6:08] I'm comfortable with what you're saying
[6:09] to me? No, I'm not going to do that. So,
[6:12] I'm going to end up looking like I'm
[6:13] grumpy. Well, right back at you, man.
[6:16] You look as grumpy as anything when I'm
[6:18] in your presence. So, you know, we're
[6:20] good. I don't really care. But my point
[6:24] is, people today living in this gray
[6:27] area, you do not realize how this is
[6:31] stressing you out because you're a child
[6:32] of God. Okay. So, I want to bring you to
[6:36] something
[6:38] uh a really astounding, astonishing
[6:41] scripture. Okay.
[6:44] And and I want to show you the
[6:46] difference between telling a lie
[6:49] um my I think I I
[6:54] must have missed this in my notes, but
[6:55] okay. Here's the difference between
[6:58] telling a lie and living by the truth.
[7:01] He that workketh deceit shall not dwell
[7:05] uh within my house. He that tellth lies
[7:07] shall not tarry in my sight. Right? So
[7:11] this is incredible. Uh
[7:16] uh he that workketh deceit shall not
[7:18] dwell. This is literally telling you
[7:21] that manipulation
[7:23] uh is going to cause you to actually
[7:26] leave the Lord's house.
[7:29] But the person that tells lies won't
[7:31] last,
[7:33] it's literally telling you if you live
[7:34] in a gray in that gray area, if you live
[7:37] in lies, if you live in this morally
[7:41] gray zone, you're not going to last
[7:43] long. You have to eventually move out of
[7:46] there into the light or else you will
[7:48] leave because it's going to get too
[7:50] pressurizing for you. Right? So, we need
[7:54] to really think about the saints.
[7:57] Now, I want I want us to focus on what
[8:00] salvation is really all about. Okay? And
[8:04] this is what's going to be uh so
[8:07] important to us. And I'll get to that a
[8:10] little later, but I want to uh it looks
[8:13] like I didn't put this here in my notes,
[8:15] but I want to share something with you
[8:18] uh to show you what what God really
[8:22] hates. And this is in Proverbsap 6-19.
[8:27] Um, so I'm just going to go to the
[8:29] message,
[8:33] share the screen. Okay. Hope you can see
[8:35] that. Proverbs 6 verse 16 to 19. So,
[8:38] this is an amazing scripture and I want
[8:40] you to to notice what the Lord speaks
[8:44] here. It's just something you need to
[8:45] read
[8:47] um uh in with your families uh even at
[8:52] family altar.
[8:54] um you know it's something you can
[8:56] discuss together. I think it's something
[8:58] really amazing that all people uh in the
[9:03] message should really look at
[9:06] these six things doth the Lord hate.
[9:10] Yay seven are an abomination unto him.
[9:13] So watch this. Th this is the only place
[9:16] in scripture where you get a ver a
[9:19] portion of scripture telling you what
[9:21] God what the spirit of truth hates.
[9:25] Right? There are six things he hates.
[9:28] But when you get the seventh, it becomes
[9:31] disgusting. An abomination means
[9:33] something disgusting, distasteful. All
[9:35] right, listen young people. A proud look
[9:40] number one. A lying tongue. Number two,
[9:45] hands that shed innocent blood. Number
[9:48] three, a heart that devises wicked
[9:52] imaginations. Right. Uh number four.
[9:56] Number five, feet that be swift in
[9:58] running to mischief. Number six,
[10:02] uh a false witness that speaketh lies,
[10:06] and he that sweth discord among
[10:09] brethren. Right. Number six. So, and
[10:11] number seven. So, the way God puts it is
[10:14] the the word puts it is there are these
[10:16] six things that he hates
[10:19] and you're you're you're even okay
[10:22] there. But when you get to the seventh,
[10:25] it's just disgusting. It's an
[10:27] abomination to God. Right? So, number
[10:31] one, a proud look. Number two, a lying
[10:34] tongue. Number three, hands that shed
[10:36] innocent blood. Number four, a heart
[10:39] that devises wicked imaginations. Number
[10:42] five, feet that that are swift in
[10:45] running to mischief. Number six, a false
[10:48] witness that speaketh lies. And number
[10:51] seven, which is the abomination, he that
[10:53] sweth discord among brethren. Where else
[10:56] will you find in the scripture a place
[10:59] where God defines something he hates?
[11:03] Right? This is how simple it is. So,
[11:07] how does God feel about you living in a
[11:11] gray area? Right? So, I want to explain
[11:14] something to you and I want you to uh to
[11:16] look at these things. So, let's look at
[11:18] a proud look, right? What is that?
[11:21] Okay. So, and this is where you need to
[11:24] look at h who you are really and what
[11:26] your nature slowly becomes. Nothing that
[11:29] the world produces in this world gives
[11:32] you humility.
[11:34] It's not how you dress. It's not how you
[11:37] do your hair. It's how you project your
[11:39] spirit. You cannot let others see your
[11:42] mistakes to protect your image, your
[11:45] status in your social circles. You are
[11:49] every all those personalities you create
[11:52] is because of pride. Because it's it's
[11:56] given you a proud look. I've got to
[11:58] portray myself in a certain way to gain
[12:01] something, right?
[12:03] God hates that. God hates a proud look.
[12:06] I'm not saying you must walk around
[12:08] looking like a hobo. Okay, be
[12:10] attractive. Be but be yourself. Don't
[12:14] hide behind a mask. Be yourself. Right.
[12:18] The second is a lying tongue.
[12:22] And and you've come to this place where
[12:24] you can no longer be completely honest
[12:26] with people. Not with parents, not with
[12:29] family, not with friends, not with the
[12:32] world. Everything you share with every
[12:36] person you live with is a halftruth.
[12:40] It's a lie. Even the songs of worship
[12:43] that we sing is a gray area because we
[12:46] sing things we don't even mean. Even our
[12:49] prayers are a gray area. When you get to
[12:51] a place when you're even praying to God
[12:54] and you're using words thinking you are
[12:57] manipulating the spirit of God, just
[12:59] wake up, pinch yourself, knock yourself
[13:01] on the head with something and AND ASK
[13:03] YOURSELF, WHAT ARE YOU SAYING RIGHT NOW?
[13:05] What are you saying to the spirit of God
[13:07] right now? when you're in church and
[13:09] you're trying to use great words to to
[13:12] influence people or to make yourself
[13:15] look like something or you're you're
[13:17] somebody they ask you to open in prayer
[13:19] and you're trying to be something you're
[13:21] not or you're trying to bring in some
[13:23] kind of charisma, just knock yourself in
[13:26] the eye or something and AND ASK
[13:27] YOURSELF, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHAT are
[13:30] you doing? Why can you not just be
[13:33] yourself and speak to God? Talk to him.
[13:37] Drop everything else away. No
[13:39] manipulation, no deceit, no trying to be
[13:42] something in front of people, no trying
[13:43] to be any extra spiritual kind of
[13:45] person. Just talk to him in truth.
[13:52] This is a lying tongue. Nobody's
[13:54] nobody's saying you're you're you're,
[13:56] you know, telling lies all the time.
[13:58] This is what's what's what's been
[14:00] happening. It's a it's a tongue that is
[14:02] just not uh uh uh conducive anymore to
[14:07] to speaking the truth, to being honest
[14:09] with people. Hands that shed innocent
[14:12] blood. You're going to say, "Brother L,
[14:14] I don't I don't kill people. I don't
[14:15] murder people." Listen, because of what
[14:20] you are groomed to be. You have been
[14:22] groomed to be selfish. you are. So
[14:24] because you've you've taken on the
[14:26] mentality and the the lifestyle of being
[14:30] selfish, you your first reaction if
[14:34] someone comes against you is to cut them
[14:36] down to protect your own interest.
[14:39] You're going to cut them down. You your
[14:41] first thing is defensiveness and then
[14:44] attack. Oh, but I'm telling you this
[14:47] because you did this, but you also and
[14:49] you did this and you did this last and
[14:51] I'm going to tell them and I'm going to
[14:52] do that's shedding innocent blood. You
[14:56] become so desensitized. So, you don't
[14:59] care what you do with your life that
[15:01] causes other people to make mistakes or
[15:04] even backslide.
[15:05] You're going to do things to damage the
[15:08] lives of other people.
[15:10] That's shedding innocent blood and God
[15:12] hates it. How about a heart that devises
[15:16] wicked imaginations? I don't do that,
[15:18] brother Al. Because you know you put
[15:22] yourself first, you suspect others of
[15:25] being the same. So you believe everybody
[15:29] doesn't have good intentions and so why
[15:32] should I? And you develop a suspicious
[15:35] nature. So therefore, you get offended
[15:38] so easily. So whenever somebody's while
[15:42] they're talking to you, your mind is
[15:44] already thinking, how can I be cleverer?
[15:47] How can I be better? How can I
[15:49] manipulate this? How can I dominate
[15:51] this? Right? What's the point of it all,
[15:54] saints?
[15:56] Number five, feet that are swift in
[15:59] running to mischief. You say, "I don't
[16:02] do that, you know. I don't I'm not that
[16:04] kind of person." What are feet in the
[16:07] Bible? In the Bible, feet are a symbol
[16:10] of intentions, right? Having a nature
[16:13] that is addicted to drama and
[16:16] negativity,
[16:17] gossip.
[16:19] Listen, all of this comes from the realm
[16:22] of lies, which is fifth dimension, which
[16:24] is the devil. A desire to always cause a
[16:27] situation and encourage incitement of
[16:31] indifference. Always running to mischief
[16:34] is using your words, using your phone,
[16:37] using your text just to create drama, to
[16:41] be a part of the drama, to be a part of
[16:43] the gossip, to be a part of something
[16:45] that brings down somebody else. Just not
[16:48] living in the light. That's feet that
[16:51] run to mischief. God hates it. Number
[16:54] six,
[16:56] false witness that speaketh lies. That
[17:00] is like using you use your your feigned
[17:05] innocence and a victim-like nature to
[17:09] cause ill to come upon other people. You
[17:12] know, a false witness in the Bible is
[17:14] one of the commandments. Thou shalt not
[17:16] bear false witness against thy neighbor.
[17:19] Somebody calls you and asks you about
[17:21] somebody, your brother, your sister.
[17:25] Tell the truth. Just tell the truth.
[17:28] That's all. and tell your brothers and
[17:30] sisters, I'm going to tell the truth.
[17:32] Some of this is going to get us into
[17:33] trouble. Some of this is going to get
[17:35] you in trouble, more you than me, or
[17:37] more me than you. But tell the truth.
[17:40] Don't be a false witness. There's
[17:43] nothing good going to come out of
[17:44] because when they find out you're a
[17:46] liar, the the retribution or rather the
[17:50] condemnation is going to be double. It's
[17:52] going to be worse. You rather tell the
[17:55] truth, be accountable for what happened,
[17:58] pay the price, and live in peace
[18:00] thereafter. Right? A false witness and
[18:04] bearing false witness against that's the
[18:06] worst thing you can do. I tell you to to
[18:09] go and and speak lies about your brother
[18:12] and sister in Christ. That's that's like
[18:15] that that is Judas. That is bearing
[18:18] false witness. Okay?
[18:20] And then you get to this. This is not
[18:23] even false witness. So So what are we
[18:25] what is all this about? This is all
[18:27] about the realm of lies, right? You
[18:30] you've been if you've been thinking the
[18:32] devil is some scaly creature with a tail
[18:34] and a fork and you know living under the
[18:37] ground amongst lava pits and no saints.
[18:41] This is what's right among us. This is
[18:44] the devil.
[18:46] This is the devil that's not being
[18:48] preached about in churches. This is the
[18:50] devil that's not being targeted in your
[18:52] daily life. Yeah. You know what? You can
[18:55] all fuss and fight and argue about the
[18:57] coming of the Lord and the seventh seal
[18:59] being open and the open book and you
[19:02] know whether he's coming in a corporal
[19:04] body or he's not or you whether the
[19:07] resurrected saint wonderful. Oh, you
[19:09] look so great. You know all the quotes.
[19:12] You can put all the doctrines together.
[19:15] But lies are all around you in your
[19:19] mouth, in your life with your family, in
[19:22] the way you dress, in the person you are
[19:24] at work, person you are at school. It's
[19:26] it's swirling around you. It's in your
[19:29] essence. It's in your thoughts. And yet
[19:33] you can quote the message to your
[19:35] heart's content. You can be among the
[19:37] people who discuss doctrines and fight
[19:40] against ministries and fight against min
[19:42] and correct this one. Correct that one.
[19:45] But your lives are surrounded by
[19:46] propaganda, advertisement, and darkness.
[19:51] And you don't realize you've been more
[19:54] accustomed to living with
[19:56] fifthdimensional influence rather than
[19:58] the seventh dimension. The seventh part
[20:01] here, he says, is he that sweth discord
[20:04] among brethren. This is the part if you
[20:06] study all this, you take these this one
[20:09] these few scriptures I showed you and
[20:11] apply that into the message demonology,
[20:13] you come to enticing spirits. And
[20:15] brother Madam said, he that saw a
[20:17] discord among brethren said that's
[20:18] sulfuric acid in the church.
[20:22] That's enticing spirits. What is this?
[20:25] You make others look bad to make
[20:29] yourself look good and speak against
[20:32] other people in the church, other
[20:35] brothers, other ministers and speak
[20:38] against them and why uh against people
[20:42] in the church and why it's it's not for
[20:44] you, right? So you want them to look bad
[20:48] so that you can look good and then
[20:51] you're actually messing up the
[20:54] relationship between that brother and
[20:55] that brother or that sister and that
[20:57] sister. You are sewing a seed of discord
[21:00] between them and secretly you want e
[21:03] both of them to be on your side. You're
[21:07] literally playing a game with people's
[21:09] lives where you're pitting them against
[21:12] each other while keeping good relations
[21:14] with both of them.
[21:17] That is disgusting in the sight of God.
[21:22] This to me is everyone's picking on
[21:24] dressing and uh you know the way people
[21:29] their hair is done or how high their
[21:31] heels are, how long their skirts are or
[21:35] what their face looks like or whether
[21:38] they go and do this or whether they they
[21:40] listen to this music or how lively they
[21:43] are in their church or how quiet they
[21:45] are. All of this stuff. But when you
[21:48] live like this, a person who pits two
[21:51] people against one another while you are
[21:55] maintaining good relations with them,
[21:59] this is an abomination to the Lord. This
[22:02] is disgusting to his nature, to his
[22:05] nature of truth. Can you honestly say
[22:09] this behavior is influenced by the
[22:11] spirit of truth? When you read all that,
[22:13] we want to see that it's God, the spirit
[22:17] of truth that condemns this behavior and
[22:20] not even the message. You young people
[22:25] can fight and and fuss
[22:28] against the message. It's not even the
[22:31] message. It and by that I'm just trying
[22:33] to point out to me the message is the
[22:35] Bible and the Bible is the message. It's
[22:37] all the message. I don't I don't see any
[22:39] difference. But I'm I'm trying to tell
[22:42] you because you're still developing and
[22:44] if you'll get upset with the prophet and
[22:46] what he says,
[22:48] well, how can you argue with those
[22:50] scriptures from Proverbs 16? What are
[22:51] you going to say then? Right? You may
[22:54] blame the message all you want. Uh it's
[22:57] too strict. It's caging me. And look at
[23:00] the reality of what is happening. I just
[23:04] want to say it this way.
[23:06] You need to to understand God hates
[23:09] pretense. God hates
[23:12] deceitfulness. It's not in his nature.
[23:16] The nature of God is truth. It's not
[23:18] deceitfulness. It's not pretense.
[23:21] We don't go to church and become actors,
[23:24] good actors.
[23:26] You say, "This is me, Lord. You know,
[23:30] this is who I am." You don't say, "This
[23:34] is me. Deal with it." Right? Let's see
[23:37] if you can deal with it. Right?
[23:41] you young people.
[23:44] Brother Al is not going to be around
[23:45] forever. If God carries for a while,
[23:50] there's going to be a church of
[23:51] tomorrow. Who will you choose to be your
[23:54] pastors?
[23:56] Your deacons, your song leaders, your
[23:58] musicians.
[24:00] What on what basis are you going to
[24:02] choose these people?
[24:04] Will you meet the conditions to lead?
[24:08] Will young men find girls who are not
[24:12] master manipulators to be pastors,
[24:14] wives, deacons wives, trustees wives?
[24:17] Young ladies, will you find men who are
[24:19] just players? Are they going to be the
[24:21] leaders of your churches? Do you even
[24:24] care whether there will be a church once
[24:26] all your elders have died off? What are
[24:28] you going to do? You have to make a
[24:30] decision now. Are you content to just
[24:33] stay along this path that you're on
[24:36] hoping for the best or are you desiring
[24:39] to make a change today?
[24:42] The difference between telling a lie and
[24:44] living a lie is [clears throat]
[24:48] we we don't want you to go away thinking
[24:51] this is easy. I just won't tell lies
[24:53] anymore and I'm and I'm good. No.
[24:59] Telling a lie is one thing. Living the
[25:03] lie is the same as telling a lie. You
[25:06] may be living by the way Hollywood
[25:09] defines something, the way the world
[25:12] defines something, the way uh the the
[25:15] internet defines something. And if you
[25:18] are living by that way, you are as good
[25:20] as telling a lie. That's ultimately what
[25:23] you're doing. You're manifesting
[25:24] something that is not the truth. It's
[25:26] not of God, right? And you will not last
[25:32] in his house. If you feel comfortable in
[25:36] the gray area, he that tells lies shall
[25:39] not tarry in my sight. You will not last
[25:41] long. Okay. So, we come to what is
[25:46] salvation about saints? And we're going
[25:50] to bring this to a close now. Salvation
[25:53] has become a thing that we understand
[25:56] from the Pentecostal point of view.
[25:58] That's what's been fed to us. The way
[26:00] they teach it to you is just another lie
[26:02] of the devil. Okay. The word salvation
[26:05] comes from the word salva.
[26:08] Sodzo,
[26:10] ointment, to heal. So what are you being
[26:14] healed of?
[26:16] Now you can define it. What am I being
[26:19] healed of? Some of you, this is why I I
[26:23] I wanted I felt in my heart to share all
[26:26] this with you and with young people. A
[26:29] lot of this we did with you in a in a
[26:32] youth meeting many years ago
[26:35] long before co
[26:37] um because some of you want to get
[26:41] baptized which we will be doing in in
[26:44] the coming year the earlier um in
[26:46] January.
[26:48] And I want you to think about this. Some
[26:50] of you born in the message, you haven't
[26:52] really done anything wrong. You haven't
[26:55] maybe
[26:57] you haven't smoked, drank, done drugs,
[26:59] fornicated. You haven't done that. And
[27:01] then you're going to be asked to repent
[27:04] and
[27:06] uh submit yourself to God and to the
[27:08] word.
[27:09] And you don't realize that salvation is
[27:13] healing from the spirit of lies.
[27:17] And that we come into this world
[27:19] speaking lies. And most of us think I
[27:24] don't speak lies. I always try to tell
[27:26] the truth. No. Speaking lies is living
[27:29] deceptively.
[27:31] Living manipulatively.
[27:34] Right? And you some of you will be
[27:36] listening to this saying, "Brother L,
[27:38] how how do we ever get out of that? This
[27:41] is too hard for us to bear." No, it's
[27:43] not. You just submit yourself to truth.
[27:46] Submit yourself to the word. Fall in
[27:48] love with the word. And he takes care of
[27:51] that. We are every day being saved.
[27:55] Salvation is a constant process of being
[27:59] healed from the effect of lies and
[28:01] deceit. This is your real enemy. I'm not
[28:04] telling you anything that's not the
[28:06] message. Brother Brandham says, "I come
[28:07] to realize my greatest enemy is William
[28:10] Brandham." What does he mean by that?
[28:13] Right? This is the truth that we are
[28:15] telling you. All the scriptures on truth
[28:18] and lies tells us that our sin is not
[28:22] really literal wrongs, wrong things that
[28:25] we did. We can give up doing wrong
[28:28] things. It's actually easier,
[28:31] right? What we never give up easy is
[28:35] living by the spirit of lies. That's
[28:38] actually what our sin, doubt, and
[28:40] unbelief is. You can give up smoking.
[28:44] You can't give up the desire for smoking
[28:46] that easy. You can give up dressing
[28:49] weird. But the desire is very hard too.
[28:53] This is why Christ focuses in and says,
[28:56] "You say you didn't kill, but you got
[28:58] angry with your brother without a cause.
[29:00] You have killed." See? So that's what we
[29:05] actually need salvation from. We need
[29:07] salvation from the nature of lies. We we
[29:10] say we are born again. We say I'm
[29:12] starting to uh to to my spirit of an
[29:17] infant from scratch. I'm starting from
[29:19] scratch. I'm I'm following the truth for
[29:21] my day. That's what we are saying.
[29:23] That's what being born again is. I my my
[29:26] spirit is being born again. I'm I'm
[29:28] bringing it back away from lies. I'm
[29:30] bringing it to truth. I'm subjecting it
[29:33] under truth. I'm putting it under the
[29:34] light of his word. I want to try and
[29:36] live in the light. That's what we're
[29:38] saying. That's what when you come to be
[29:40] baptized, that's what I want. Every day
[29:43] after I'm baptized, young person, you
[29:45] should be desiring. I want to know the
[29:47] word. I want to know the word more than
[29:49] before. I want to live in that word. I
[29:51] want to study it. I want to be in
[29:52] church. I want to fellowship in it.
[29:54] That's what I want. That's what your
[29:56] desire ought to be. That's more than
[29:58] just a Pentecostal experience of
[30:00] shouting and screaming and speaking with
[30:02] tongues and prophesying and having
[30:03] dreams. That's what we want to see
[30:06] coming from people. Amen.
[30:09] Uh let's read this
[30:12] this quote.
[30:14] Um there just two quotes here I think
[30:16] before we close.
[30:19] Yeah.
[30:21] So
[30:26] what is salvation all about?
[30:29] What happens when I'm born again? Right?
[30:32] Spoken word is the original seed.
[30:33] Paragraph 122. The prophet is saying,
[30:37] "Then except you be except a man be born
[30:39] again, why must he be born again? He's
[30:42] dead. The flesh he's in. He is he's
[30:45] hybrid. He's got to be born again. Why?
[30:48] Why? He was born in sin from Eve sin,
[30:52] shaped in iniquity, come to the world
[30:55] speaking lies. He's a liar to begin
[30:59] with." Listen, the prophet is not saying
[31:01] you're a you're an adulterer.
[31:05] You're a you're a smoker. You're a
[31:07] drinker.
[31:09] You come into the world speaking li.
[31:10] Your first issue is lies.
[31:13] He's a liar to begin with. No matter how
[31:16] smart, educated, what more he is, he's a
[31:21] liar.
[31:25] Spoken word is your original seed. Uh
[31:29] I think that should have been
[31:32] Oh, communion. Oh, we still we're still
[31:34] reading on. Sorry. The Bible says he is
[31:36] he's a liar, right? How holy his parents
[31:39] was or anything about it, he's a liar to
[31:41] begin with. That's pretty flat. In other
[31:44] words, brother is saying that's the
[31:46] brutal truth, right? Like Christ is
[31:48] saying you're a dog.
[31:51] But that's what God said. Uh-huh. Let
[31:55] every man's word be a lie and mine be
[31:58] true. anything that comes from his lips
[32:01] contrary to deny his word or put it in
[32:06] some other race or some other generation
[32:08] or whatever it is it is he's a liar.
[32:14] Okay. The message communion
[32:17] paragraph 44 45 I was saying this taking
[32:21] for myself like you was going to say
[32:23] William Brandham well 40 years ago the
[32:25] William Brandom it isn't the same one
[32:27] tonight. If somebody back there could si
[32:29] would say William Brham he was a rank
[32:32] rascal see because I was born of Charles
[32:35] and Ella Brham in their nature I was a
[32:39] sinner I came to the world a liar and
[32:42] all the habits of the world laid right
[32:45] in me there saints here's the prophet
[32:48] telling you exactly what we've been
[32:49] telling you all this time today right I
[32:53] came all the habits of the world laid in
[32:56] me see I just broke that statement given
[32:58] down to you practically so you
[33:00] understood that you were groomed by lies
[33:03] that becomes a part of you cuz you're
[33:05] living in this world right I'm I haven't
[33:07] been telling you psychology or anything
[33:09] other than breaking down the one
[33:11] statement there brother Maram is saying
[33:13] all the habits of the world laid right
[33:16] in me I came to the world a liar
[33:22] but down in there too glory to God was
[33:25] another nature presence See
[33:28] predestinated
[33:29] was in there by God in the same body.
[33:34] See two natures in there. Well, I only
[33:37] catered to one. As it growed, I good as
[33:41] a baby. Da da. First thing you know, I
[33:45] become a liar. Become everything else
[33:47] that's a sinner. Because I raised up
[33:50] that way. But down in there was a speck
[33:54] of life all the time. Glory to God.
[33:59] Saints, there's our hope. This is the
[34:02] truth, right? Being a believer, there is
[34:05] a gene seed in your soul, young people,
[34:07] that has been laying there dormant for
[34:10] many years. It is that sense inside of
[34:13] you. That's what we were telling the the
[34:14] little children at Sunday school.
[34:16] There's these two voices. See again
[34:19] we're telling you brother Madam is
[34:20] telling there are two natures inside of
[34:22] you and and one is tending to truth one
[34:25] is tending to lies and you've got
[34:28] whenever you're in a situation you are
[34:30] presented there are those two voices
[34:32] present and it is that inside you even
[34:37] though you were brought up in this world
[34:39] of lies there's a sense inside you that
[34:42] warned you every time you lied and and
[34:45] there's that sense that makes you feel
[34:47] bad about it. Even though you go and you
[34:49] tell your friends, I told them this and
[34:50] I did that, but inside you something is
[34:52] saying you're not a good person. What
[34:55] you did there was not right. Some that
[34:57] that little something, a little voice
[34:59] inside is telling you you shouldn't have
[35:01] done that. And if you didn't have it,
[35:04] you wouldn't feel bad about it. But
[35:07] because you have it, you know there's
[35:09] something inside there. There's some
[35:11] presence of God inside, some spirit of
[35:14] truth inside that's telling you, "You
[35:17] shouldn't have done that. You need to
[35:18] make this right." When you are born
[35:20] again
[35:21] is when the spirit of truth begins to
[35:24] grow in you. That little gene seed, that
[35:26] little speck of life starts to grow. And
[35:29] the more the truth grows, the more it's
[35:32] going to challenge you, the more it's
[35:34] going to convict you, the more it's
[35:35] going to make you change and break away
[35:37] from all those habits that's been laid
[35:39] in you. Like the prophet said, the
[35:41] spirit is constantly forcing you to be
[35:43] honest with your feelings, your
[35:45] intentions. And after years, it causes
[35:47] you to become so honest about everything
[35:50] because it makes it makes you a true
[35:53] worshipper. It makes you stand in
[35:55] church, close your eyes, forget about
[35:57] people around you. Right now, young
[35:59] people, you don't want to do that. You
[36:01] don't want to say amen. You don't want
[36:02] to raise your hands. You don't want to
[36:04] close your eyes and look a mess. You you
[36:07] want to protect an image. You want to
[36:09] protect something. You want to not look
[36:11] foolish. You want to not look like like
[36:14] uh somebody might criticize me for what
[36:16] I'm what I'm doing. You're trying to
[36:18] protect something. You're just
[36:20] succumbing to that nature. But one of
[36:23] these days, you're going to break out of
[36:25] that and you're going to raise your
[36:26] hand. You're going to say amen to the
[36:28] word. You're going to be somebody who's
[36:30] going to agree in your spirit and it's
[36:32] going to show out. You're going to break
[36:33] out crying and say, "Thank you, Lord,
[36:35] for speaking to me today. You you're
[36:37] going to you're going to become a
[36:39] worshipper one day that's going to just
[36:41] stand in God's presence and feel the
[36:43] rain of his Holy Spirit touching you and
[36:46] and falling down upon you and just going
[36:48] to raise your hand and say, "Praise be
[36:50] to God. Hallelujah. Glory to God. You
[36:53] are worthy to be praised." You are going
[36:55] to be that person and you're going to
[36:56] break free and you're going to know that
[36:58] you're free. That's because that little
[37:00] gene seed inside is growing and growing
[37:02] and it only grows because of truth.
[37:05] Because truth is presenting itself to
[37:07] you and filling you with light and all
[37:10] darkness is disappearing. Praise be to
[37:12] God. This spirit is constantly forcing
[37:15] you to be honest with your feelings. And
[37:18] it's going to cause you to become so
[37:19] honest about everything because it makes
[37:21] you realize there is only one way that
[37:24] man should live and that is by the
[37:26] truth. Man shall not live by bread
[37:28] alone, but by every word that proceeds
[37:31] out of the mouth of God. You don't have
[37:34] time anymore, young people. Why? Why are
[37:36] we speaking to you this way in this
[37:38] time? You just simply do not have time
[37:40] anymore. Um I had more time when I was
[37:44] growing up as a teenager. Um because the
[37:48] world was not as liberal around me. Uh
[37:51] not as free with sinfulness. But you
[37:54] will be deformed by lies much faster
[37:57] than I would have ever been in my day as
[38:00] a teenager. And even uh well my parents
[38:03] day I don't know they they had Woodstock
[38:05] and rock music and things like that and
[38:08] [laughter]
[38:09] I I didn't even live in that kind of
[38:10] time. So, um, I I did this before. As a
[38:15] quick comparison, when I was a child, if
[38:18] I had to go and watch a movie, I had to
[38:21] sneak into my neighbor's house to go
[38:23] watch a movie and and lie to my dad or
[38:25] something and go watch He-Man and the
[38:27] Masters of the Universe or something or,
[38:29] you know, whatever it was. Uh, and then
[38:32] come back and lie about it or or or
[38:34] either tell them the truth and, you
[38:36] know, and and and get a reprimanding or
[38:38] something. But you you can do
[38:43] I don't know I cannot even count how
[38:45] many movies you can do in less than one
[38:47] week or in one day. Uh where I would
[38:52] probably if I could sneak into my
[38:54] friend's house and try to watch a movie
[38:56] once a year when I was growing up as a
[38:58] teenager. Now, why am I telling you this
[39:01] is because all all of the movies that
[39:05] you watch, all that you consume on the
[39:07] internet today,
[39:09] don't don't kid yourself. It's so filled
[39:12] with lies and deception and manipulation
[39:15] and you don't realize how it's hurting
[39:17] your little fragile spirit and soul.
[39:20] Don't kid Don't kid yourself. Don't you
[39:23] go you go and watch all these stuff and
[39:25] don't think it's not affecting you. It's
[39:28] affecting you. I can see it affecting
[39:30] it's affecting your speech. It's
[39:31] affecting how you read the Bible, how
[39:33] you interpret the message, how your
[39:35] reactions with with people, your your
[39:38] the way you conduct yourself at work,
[39:40] the way you conduct yourself at school.
[39:41] I can see it. It's there. It's evident.
[39:44] It's affecting you. It's infiltrating
[39:45] you. It's making you become something
[39:47] that you're observing. your manner of
[39:49] speech, your your your actions, your
[39:52] manners toward other people, it's
[39:55] affecting you and you don't realize
[39:57] you're breeding it now. It's not even
[39:59] your parents and other people as much as
[40:01] what you are consuming. This is why I'm
[40:03] saying I I feel so bad for you and I
[40:05] feel terrified for you because I didn't
[40:08] grow up this with with what you are
[40:10] growing up with today and that the times
[40:12] have changed so much that you just don't
[40:14] have a chance. You don't have time to
[40:17] catch up after you've already been so
[40:20] badly bombarded and and damaged by what
[40:24] this world is throwing at you 24/7.
[40:28] Right? So, in closing, I want to I want
[40:31] to let you see why we are in the
[40:34] message. I'm not some duped, brainwashed
[40:37] fool. I'm not here doing this because I
[40:41] get I get something out of it, as in
[40:43] there's something that I gain. No, more
[40:45] than likely more people are going to
[40:48] hate me for what I'm what I say. More
[40:50] than likely more people are going to
[40:52] disregard and it's going to happen.
[40:55] Putting myself out on YouTube and stuff
[40:57] like that. Once the world gets hold of
[41:00] of this, once there are people out there
[41:02] in the world who get a hold of our
[41:04] videos and then you're going to see it
[41:06] start. They're going to start labeling
[41:07] me a brandomite, a cult. Uh you're going
[41:11] to see it's going to happen. So far,
[41:13] it's just been message believers
[41:14] disagreeing with me. But once it's it
[41:17] starts to get to the public, it's just
[41:19] going to be an onslaught. You're going
[41:22] to see that I'm not going to get
[41:24] anything out of this. I'm going to get
[41:25] more rejection, more uh uh uh and and I
[41:29] don't care. And it's not about me cuz I
[41:31] know they're rejecting God's word.
[41:34] They're rejecting the truth. But the
[41:37] message brings the wisdom of truth to
[41:40] mankind. You are not going to find truth
[41:43] like this anywhere else in the world.
[41:46] You are not going to find truth outside
[41:48] of the Bible and the message of the
[41:49] hour. The spirit of lies deforms the
[41:52] nature of man, but the spirit of truth
[41:55] builds him up again. The spirit of truth
[41:58] heals the nature of man. The spirit of
[42:00] truth sets you free, but the spirit of
[42:03] lies deforms you. The more you follow
[42:06] the internet, the more you follow
[42:08] Hollywood, the more you follow all the
[42:10] worldly stuff that comes out, the more
[42:13] multi-personality
[42:14] disorder it's going to produce, the more
[42:16] you are going to be somebody else to
[42:18] your parents, somebody else to your
[42:20] siblings, somebody else to your boss,
[42:22] somebody else to your friends, somebody
[42:24] else to your people at church. You are
[42:25] going to have all these people and then
[42:27] you look in the mirror one day and you
[42:29] don't know who to be. You don't know who
[42:31] to choose from. Who am I really from all
[42:34] these people that I portray? Whereas
[42:37] when you take his word, you eat the
[42:40] book, you become him. When you become
[42:43] him, that's an identity. That's one
[42:46] identity. That's one identity you want
[42:48] to be. That's one identity you can live
[42:50] by. That's one identity that gives you a
[42:52] happy marriage. your children who
[42:55] respect you. People who are real friends
[42:58] with you. A boss who can respect you as
[43:01] someone who tells the truth and you and
[43:02] doesn't want to manipulate you, doesn't
[43:05] need to manipulate you. Friends who know
[43:07] they can always count on you. People who
[43:09] know they can always come to you, who
[43:11] you will always tell the truth and you
[43:13] will not manipulate them. You become a
[43:16] savior of the world. You become someone
[43:18] who passes on the bomb and Gilead who
[43:21] who is salvation to other people. That
[43:24] is an identity that somebody can
[43:26] recognize. He is different. She is
[43:28] different to the rest of the world.
