[0:00] Brothers and sisters, greetings in the
[0:03] wonderful name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:06] Happy to be serving the bride of Christ
[0:08] once again
[0:10] this uh 27th of September 2020.
[0:15] And we're dealing with the second part
[0:16] of the throne of God. So throne of God
[0:19] part two. And I want to title this
[0:22] message um a tabernacle that I may dwell
[0:26] among them. I want to take a simple
[0:28] thought to do a second part of an
[0:32] introduction towards this series. We're
[0:35] going to read from Exodus 25 1-9.
[0:40] This is a very
[0:43] uh simple, easy to follow um message
[0:48] that I think is vitally important when
[0:52] we look at our own lives and uh very
[0:55] very important um uh reason for
[1:01] God doing certain things with the the
[1:04] building and the makeup of the
[1:05] tabernacle of Moses.
[1:08] So, I want us to understand just a
[1:12] little bit where we're heading with this
[1:14] series.
[1:16] Um, so the throne of God, like I said
[1:18] before,
[1:20] had never been seen by anybody or
[1:23] perceived by anybody prior to Moses.
[1:27] There was no recordings of
[1:30] any man seeing God sitting in a throne
[1:35] or of any kind resembling that which
[1:38] earthly kings had um built for
[1:41] themselves.
[1:44] So we only find uh visions of thrones
[1:47] later especially like in Isaiah
[1:51] and Ezekiel
[1:53] and uh later until the book of
[1:55] revelations.
[1:56] But prior to that
[1:59] the only semblance of something throne
[2:04] was seen here in the wilderness with the
[2:06] tabernacle of Moses. So it's often
[2:09] called the tabernacle of Moses. which is
[2:10] called the tabernacle of the testimony.
[2:13] Uh so get used to those phrases.
[2:17] So in this series, what we're going to
[2:18] do is we're going to take this
[2:21] tabernacle of Moses and take it piece by
[2:25] piece, room by room, piece by piece,
[2:28] furniture,
[2:29] uh each piece of furniture, and
[2:31] understand every single attribute that
[2:34] made up this tabernacle, every attribute
[2:37] that was of great significance.
[2:40] And uh to do that we're going to have to
[2:42] understand a lot of things that God
[2:45] asked them to do. And uh we're going to
[2:48] start with Exodus 25 and verse 1-9. And
[2:51] this is again this is just an
[2:52] introduction. I think in the next part
[2:55] we're going to start with the most holy
[2:56] place and move outwards and um we'll see
[3:01] how the Lord leads us from there. So
[3:02] Exodus 25:1-9
[3:05] I trust the the word would be a blessing
[3:07] to you.
[3:10] Verse one. And the Lord spake unto
[3:12] Moses, saying, speak unto the children
[3:13] of Israel that they bring me an
[3:16] offering. So, I want you to notice those
[3:20] of you that follow the notes. Uh we're
[3:22] going to be dealing with 11
[3:25] um uh phrases from [snorts] this section
[3:29] of scripture,
[3:31] from these uh um nine verses. We're
[3:34] going to be dealing with 11 points. And
[3:36] I've labeled them with a star and a
[3:39] number in the scriptures written in the
[3:41] notes. So number one, the phrase that
[3:45] we're going to be dealing with is bring
[3:47] me an offering
[3:49] of every man that number two giveth it
[3:51] willingly with his heart. You shall take
[3:54] my offering.
[3:56] Uh uh verse three, and this is the
[3:59] offering which you shall take of them.
[4:01] Number three, gold and silver and brass.
[4:05] Verse four. And number four, blue and
[4:08] purple and scarlet and fine linen,
[4:10] goat's hair and ramkins dyed red and the
[4:13] badger skins and shitim wood. Verse six.
[4:19] Number five, oil for the light. Number
[4:22] six, spices for anointing oil and for
[4:24] sweet incense. Number seven, onyx stones
[4:28] and stones to be set in the ephford and
[4:31] in the breastplate. Number eight, and
[4:34] let them
[4:36] um make me a sanctuary. So make me a
[4:40] sanctuary. Number eight.
[4:42] Um so then the next phrase here is I've
[4:46] put as number 11 because I want to deal
[4:48] with that last that is make me a
[4:50] sanctuary number 11 that I may dwell
[4:52] among them. So we'll deal with that
[4:54] point last. In verse 9, we find point
[4:57] number nine and point number 10.
[4:59] according to all that I show thee, after
[5:02] the pattern of the tabernacle, and the
[5:04] pattern of the instruments thereof, even
[5:07] so shall you make it. So to start off
[5:12] building this tabernacle in the
[5:13] wilderness,
[5:15] they
[5:17] they had to bring in materials,
[5:21] which they had. Now you're looking at
[5:23] about 2 million people walking through
[5:26] deserts and wilderness. there's not much
[5:28] resources they could find in the
[5:33] the ground or terrain around them. So
[5:36] the tabernacle, just think about this,
[5:38] the tabernacle had to be built from
[5:41] whatever they had
[5:44] with them on that journey.
[5:47] This is astounding, right? So these are
[5:51] the things the these are the the
[5:53] important points in here. And um the
[5:56] first thing is
[5:58] the makeup of of the tabernacle itself,
[6:02] the materials it itself had to be an
[6:05] offering. God asked for them to bring an
[6:08] offering. So that's point number one.
[6:10] Bring me an offering. So to begin the
[6:12] the building of the tabernacle, they had
[6:15] to collect the materials for this task.
[6:18] What is amazing is that God could have
[6:19] easily raised up something the way he
[6:22] created the earth. So people would know
[6:24] that it was built by God himself. Come
[6:26] on people. Uh he he put the earth
[6:29] together by faith. Why not speak things
[6:32] into existence and create this
[6:35] tabernacle, beautiful, flashy tabernacle
[6:39] of the best materials he could find? Why
[6:42] not just, you know, speak things into
[6:46] existence and this amazing tabernacle
[6:49] could appear in the wilderness and these
[6:51] people
[6:53] could then uh move with this tabernacle
[6:56] wherever they want. Why not do that,
[6:58] right? Wouldn't that have made that
[7:02] building the most holy and honored
[7:06] building by man? Wouldn't it have just
[7:08] been amazing? Wouldn't the peoples of
[7:11] earth have then recognized and believed?
[7:13] Is that not what God wanted? Why ask
[7:17] these poor slaves and bedins to give up
[7:22] their most precious belongings and all
[7:24] that they had to build this tabernacle.
[7:27] See, he could have easily built it by
[7:31] spoken word and it would have been the
[7:34] most amazing
[7:36] uh tabernacle in the entire world. the
[7:39] entire world would have recognized it
[7:40] straight away that this was not built by
[7:43] man.
[7:45] But he chose not to do that. He didn't.
[7:48] He chose to build his tabernacle which
[7:52] he would dwell among the people. He
[7:54] chose to build it from the belongings of
[7:58] men,
[8:00] slaves,
[8:02] sinners.
[8:04] It was not even something that they
[8:06] could go out and gather or hue. It had
[8:09] to be something they owned.
[8:12] I want you to as always saints, you
[8:15] know, I believe that
[8:19] the Lord has inspired us in the ministry
[8:21] to look at the word in a certain way.
[8:25] And the way we like to look at it is
[8:28] personal. We like to look at it such
[8:30] that it means something to us right now.
[8:34] Now look at this. God wanted them to
[8:38] bring things to build his mighty
[8:40] tabernacle
[8:42] from things that they owned and he
[8:45] wanted them to give it to him as an
[8:47] offering things that they owned. Now
[8:51] there are a few reasons for this. The
[8:53] first is that man would have made the
[8:55] building an idol
[8:58] as he would have with everything that
[9:01] that is created by God. What am I
[9:04] saying? Uh if God created that
[9:07] tabernacle, can you imagine what kind of
[9:10] idol that tabernacle would have been?
[9:12] [clears throat]
[9:14] Right? The second is that by doing this,
[9:18] God could be hidden in simplicity and
[9:21] not noticed by the world.
[9:24] Um, underestimated
[9:27] by the world.
[9:29] So this way he could deal with his
[9:32] children in secret. I want you to notice
[9:35] every statement I'm making to you right
[9:37] now is something of great revelation.
[9:41] God wants to be hidden in simplicity.
[9:43] Look at all these these phrases. We know
[9:45] that these are words brother Brennan
[9:47] alone spoke. God wants to be hidden in
[9:49] simplicity. God doesn't want to be
[9:52] noticed by the whole world. He wants to
[9:54] be noticed by his elect.
[9:56] He wants to deal with his children in
[9:58] secret. Right?
[10:02] And he wants his tabernacle to be an
[10:05] offering from his people to him that he
[10:09] might dwell among them.
[10:11] Thirdly, [clears throat] a sacrifice on
[10:14] behalf of the believer was required for
[10:17] the building. So, so God could see the
[10:21] hearts and intents of the givers and so
[10:24] that he could show that he could
[10:26] sanctify what man had to offer.
[10:31] Amen.
[10:32] All right. So, point number two. Let's
[10:34] get to point number two. Let every man
[10:38] give it willingly with his heart. So
[10:40] that's the the part there that we ended
[10:42] off with uh just now. This part shows
[10:46] that giving this offering had to be done
[10:49] willingly.
[10:51] Amen. As with any offering that is given
[10:54] to God
[10:56] in church, out of church, whatever it
[11:00] is, if it's not done willingly, saints,
[11:03] it is it is like a curse to you. This is
[11:07] what was important for the building.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; [clears throat]
[11:10] &gt;&gt; So I want you to when you think about
[11:12] it, of course you know the answer we're
[11:15] going to come to towards the end of the
[11:16] series. You are the tabernacle of God.
[11:19] You are the building. You are the
[11:20] tabernacle of the Holy Ghost. You are
[11:23] what he had in his mind before the
[11:25] foundation of the world. But we lost
[11:27] that thought. We lost that ability to
[11:29] realize this. So when we put all this
[11:32] together,
[11:34] the part that is here important is that
[11:37] you have to give this tabernacle
[11:39] willingly. You have to give certain
[11:41] parts of this tabernacle willingly and
[11:44] this was important for the building. If
[11:46] it was not given willingly, it wouldn't
[11:50] be a perfect tabernacle.
[11:52] The offering would not be accepted if it
[11:56] was given grudgingly or with reserve.
[11:59] For example, people in this message who
[12:02] follow this message as if they are
[12:03] restricted
[12:05] as if God owes them something because
[12:07] they they have done many years of
[12:10] service for the message or they've
[12:12] brought people in or they've done
[12:15] something for the church or they've
[12:16] given great offerings or uh that's
[12:21] that's not a tabernacle that his spirit
[12:24] would abide in.
[12:26] See, it could only be sanctified. That's
[12:29] what's happening here. The offering that
[12:32] is given can only be sanctified if the
[12:35] believer had faith that by his offering
[12:38] he was losing nothing and gaining
[12:42] everything.
[12:43] Praise be to God.
[12:46] Since that's the mentality that we have
[12:48] to have when we give our lives to
[12:50] Christ. When we give our all to Christ,
[12:53] our body, our spirit, our soul, our
[12:55] everything, our family, our children,
[12:58] our wives, our loved ones, when we lose,
[13:01] when we give them as an offering, when
[13:03] we present them as an offering before
[13:05] the Lord,
[13:08] we've got to give it with this mindset
[13:11] that I'm losing nothing and I'm gaining
[13:14] everything.
[13:15] You see, this was the test of the intent
[13:17] of the heart. This was the most
[13:19] important test to God. How would Moses
[13:22] know what was in their hearts, in the
[13:24] hearts of the people? Moses had to
[13:26] receive the the materials from all the
[13:28] people, right? How would he know? God
[13:32] gave him the discernment he needed to
[13:34] complete this task. He would have to re
[13:37] he would have to sit there and receive
[13:39] every single piece of material brought
[13:42] in by the people. He would then have to
[13:45] look into the eyes of the believer
[13:47] presenting this to him and God would
[13:50] give him discernment to know because if
[13:53] something even if it was a piece of
[13:55] leather that was handed to him
[13:57] grudgingly his spirit would have to
[13:59] sense that and he would have to return
[14:01] that to that man and say I am sorry sir
[14:04] I cannot accept something for the
[14:07] tabernacle of the most high to be
[14:10] something that was given grudgingly or
[14:13] with reserve. love. No way can I accept
[14:16] this, sir. That's what he'd have to say.
[14:19] This was the most important test to God.
[14:21] So, the next thing we're going to notice
[14:23] is that God asked for all their most
[14:26] precious belongings. Now, this is
[14:29] linked, right? You may say, well, uh,
[14:32] you know what? Maybe one guy could have
[14:34] given his old shoes or something. God
[14:36] was specific about what he wanted from
[14:38] them,
[14:40] right? He asked for their most precious
[14:42] belongings. Why would he do that?
[14:48] Amen. Does God really consider the
[14:52] materials of earth to be valuable and
[14:55] precious?
[14:58] The materials of earth like gold and
[15:00] silver, these things are precious to
[15:02] man. They are they are precious to the
[15:05] carnal eyes of man [clears throat]
[15:08] or the eyes of carnal man. Right? People
[15:11] we know searching, running for gold and
[15:13] silver around the world. They've had
[15:15] gold rushes, diamond rushes around the
[15:18] world. And I mean, it's been in our
[15:21] history that men have killed for these
[15:24] things. So why would God ask them as if
[15:29] God is like a man that likes to have
[15:32] glittering stuff for his throne?
[15:36] Did he did God really want to be uh
[15:40] aligned with earthly kings? Did he
[15:42] really want to live amongst or have his
[15:46] rooms in a sense uh looking like uh gody
[15:52] gold and silver and precious stones
[15:55] resembling corrupt earthly kings? The
[15:58] answer is simple. No. God doesn't God
[16:02] doesn't consider gold and silver and
[16:04] things like that to be precious metals.
[16:08] But he knows that we do. See, he knew
[16:13] that men liked gold and silver. He knew
[16:17] that men considered these metals
[16:19] precious metals. Men looked at them. Men
[16:22] saw that they were attractive. So God
[16:25] asked him to bring to him the things
[16:28] that they felt were attractive.
[16:31] Why did he demand those most precious
[16:33] belongings? Again, part of the test of
[16:36] the heart. See, it is harder to separate
[16:40] with things we consider most valuable to
[16:43] us,
[16:45] right? It's easier to give things that
[16:47] you're willing that you were ready to
[16:49] give away 10 years ago. But things that
[16:53] are most valuable, it's very hard to
[16:56] give those things. Also, the more
[16:59] valuable the makeup of the tabernacle
[17:01] was to the believers, the more they
[17:04] would respect it. See, so if the
[17:07] tabernacle was just made out of broken
[17:09] wood and some kind of uh filthy animal
[17:13] skins,
[17:15] you know, and it wasn't washed and
[17:19] cleansed and taken care of and made to
[17:21] be perfect in every every inch, every
[17:24] little way, it wouldn't have had the
[17:26] respect, right? So that was the
[17:30] conditions of that time. So this was
[17:32] testing time all around. Doing this
[17:35] would weed out also all the thieves in
[17:39] the camp, those who would lust lust
[17:42] after the riches of the tabernacle. Once
[17:45] all these were given, all men were equal
[17:48] in one another's eye because the Lord
[17:51] held all the wealth. Do you understand
[17:53] that? So what God did was basically took
[17:57] away all the precious metals from all of
[17:59] them.
[18:01] Whether some were rich, whether some
[18:02] came out of Egypt with more gold than
[18:05] the other, God took it all, brought it
[18:07] all in. And then by doing that, all the
[18:11] believers were equal. There was no rich,
[18:13] no poor among them. They were all equal.
[18:18] Amen. This is amazing.
[18:22] All right. So, let's have a look at what
[18:24] God asked for. All right. Point number
[18:26] three, he asked for precious metals.
[18:28] Now, why precious metals? like gold,
[18:32] silver and brass very important metals
[18:35] to understand. Now I know we used to
[18:37] speak about the symbolic reasons and we
[18:39] will later in the series. In the series
[18:41] we're going to look at the gold you know
[18:44] overlaying the wood and so on. You know
[18:47] gold meaning like deity silver
[18:50] redemption and judgment. But let's look
[18:53] at the effect on the individual. That's
[18:55] what I'm going to focus on in this
[18:57] introduction. These metals, gold, silver
[19:00] and brass, they made a man define
[19:03] himself or his self in society and
[19:07] others would do the same of him. So what
[19:09] does that mean? Basically, if a man was
[19:11] wearing gold and shiny things in gold
[19:14] and silver, uh he was said to be a a
[19:17] wealthy lord or someone who was uh of
[19:21] high society. If a man was wearing
[19:24] brass, he was more likely a soldier, a
[19:26] general or something. And he walked
[19:28] around in in that hard brass um armor.
[19:33] He was he had great respect. So men were
[19:36] able to define themselves in society by
[19:40] these metals that they wore on their
[19:43] person.
[19:44] There was no purpose for gold or silver
[19:47] except for one thing, for vanity. Right?
[19:51] There was no need for vanity anymore
[19:53] amongst believers. You're all walking
[19:56] through the wilderness. You don't know
[19:58] where you're going. You have no plan for
[20:00] your future. Uh what's the point of
[20:02] having all the vanity? What's the point
[20:04] of dressing up in gold and silver?
[20:06] What's the point of keeping gold and
[20:08] silver hidden away in your wagons or in
[20:10] your boots somewhere when you're never
[20:13] going to be able to use it? Uh there's
[20:15] nothing to buy. There's no one to pay.
[20:17] You're at the mercy of the desert.
[20:19] you're at the mercy of God. There's no
[20:21] reason for your gold or silver. So if if
[20:24] you keep it, all it is is lust and
[20:26] vanity. Right
[20:28] now, brass, brass, we could understand,
[20:31] was a hard metal, good for making
[20:32] weapons and armor and other things to
[20:35] make them longlasting.
[20:37] But why would they need armor when the
[20:40] Lord, the pillar of fire, would fight
[20:43] for them? These people had no need for
[20:45] armor. They had no need for precious
[20:48] metals. They had no need for any of
[20:49] those things yet they had them because
[20:51] they had took of the spoils of Egypt.
[20:54] Why would they need why would they
[20:57] needed have needed longlasting things
[21:00] when they were on a journey to their
[21:02] promised land where Jehovah Gyra would
[21:04] be there?
[21:06] These metals were symbols of wealth and
[21:09] status. Giving it all over to the Lord
[21:12] willfully was going to cause the
[21:14] believer to overcome many things that
[21:16] led to pride.
[21:19] Praise be to God. Let's go to the next
[21:21] point. Point number four, which is
[21:24] precious cloths and precious materials.
[21:28] Now again here in these uh in Exodus 25,
[21:33] you see the precious cloths are blue and
[21:36] purple and scarlet, fine linen and
[21:39] goat's hair, ram skins dyed red, badger
[21:42] skins and shitim wood. Right now these
[21:47] were precious materials. They were
[21:51] cloths and of course the only uh
[21:54] different thing there was the wood.
[21:56] Right now again here was something that
[21:59] brought vanity because these people were
[22:01] walking through the wilderness. Why
[22:03] would they need to wear purple, scarlet,
[22:06] fine linen and so on? clothing
[22:09] themselves in precious cloth amounted to
[22:12] nothing else but vanity and pride. I
[22:15] want you to notice the theme that's
[22:16] running through this. Right? It seems
[22:19] like God is trying to remove vanity and
[22:23] pride from the person.
[22:25] These spirits had to be removed from the
[22:28] believer. But all these cloths were
[22:31] being used for the tabernacle. So I mean
[22:35] God is taking the ability to dress in a
[22:40] vain manner
[22:41] away from these people walking through
[22:44] the wilderness.
[22:45] But then he takes all these cloths and
[22:47] and makes them be used for the clothing
[22:50] of the priests.
[22:52] Right?
[22:53] So he takes them away from the believer
[22:56] but uses them for the tabernacle. Why?
[22:59] And God was very particular about these
[23:01] things. When the people crossed into the
[23:03] promised land, he warned them not to
[23:06] take any gold, silver, or anything of
[23:08] the natives of the new land. Let's read
[23:11] Deuteronomy 7:25-26.
[23:14] The graven images of their gods you
[23:17] shall burn with fire. Thou shalt not
[23:19] desire the silver or gold that is on
[23:21] them, nor take it unto thee, lest thou
[23:23] be snared therein, for is an abomination
[23:25] to the Lord thy God. Neither shalt thou
[23:28] bring an abomination into thine house,
[23:30] lest thou be a cursed like it, lest thou
[23:33] be a cursed thing like it, but thou
[23:36] shalt utterly detest it. Thou shalt,
[23:39] that means hate it. Thou shalt utterly
[23:41] abhore it. Again, hate it, for is it is
[23:45] a cursed thing. Joshua 6:17-19.
[23:49] and the city shall be accursed, even it,
[23:52] and all that are therein to the Lord
[23:54] unto Rahab the um only Rahab the harlot
[23:59] shall live, and all that are with her in
[24:03] the house, because she hid the
[24:04] messengers that we sent. And you in in
[24:07] any wise keep yourself from the thing,
[24:10] lest you make yourselves a cursed when
[24:13] you take of the thing and make the camp
[24:15] of Israel a curse and trouble it. But
[24:17] all the silver and gold and vessels of
[24:19] brass and iron are consecrated unto the
[24:22] Lord. They shall come into the treasury
[24:25] of the Lord. So notice God calls these
[24:28] things the thing. Yet he allows it to be
[24:33] taken into the treasury of the
[24:34] tabernacle.
[24:36] Sounds a bit like the church plundering
[24:38] the people, right? The church and the
[24:41] angels use these scriptures, these very
[24:42] scriptures to justify their robbery of
[24:44] the people. The Christian church is is
[24:47] guilty of robbery of the public for many
[24:50] many hundreds of years. Taking away the
[24:53] most uh precious things from the people
[24:57] and piling it up into the riches of the
[24:59] church, making the church um um rulers
[25:04] the rich ones. God's purpose was not the
[25:07] richness of the church, but to protect
[25:11] the people from idol worship. And even
[25:14] worse, he knew they would corrupt
[25:16] themselves with these things that led to
[25:18] vanity and pride. Most people think it
[25:21] was just about idols because the
[25:24] heathen's gold and precious things were
[25:27] in the images of their he their heathen
[25:30] idols.
[25:32] Um, but it was not just idolatry that
[25:35] God was being careful of. Let's read
[25:37] Joshua 7 and verse one. But the children
[25:40] of Israel committed a trespass in the
[25:42] thing. For Achen, the son of Carmi, the
[25:44] son of Zabdi, the son of Zera, of the
[25:47] tribe of Judah, took of the thing, and
[25:49] the anger of the Lord was kindled
[25:51] against the children of Israel.
[25:55] Um, so Joshua, let's read
[25:57] [clears throat] verse 22 to verse 24. So
[25:59] Joshua sent messengers and they ran into
[26:01] the tent, and behold, it was hid in his
[26:04] tent and the silver under it. And they
[26:06] took them out of the midst of the tent,
[26:07] and brought them unto Joshua, and unto
[26:10] all the children of Israel, and laid
[26:12] them out before the Lord. And Joshua and
[26:13] all Israel with him, took Achen, the son
[26:15] of Zer, and the silver, and the garment,
[26:17] and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and
[26:20] his daughters, and his oxen, and his
[26:21] ass, and his sheep, and his tent, and
[26:23] all that he had, and they brought them
[26:25] into the valley of Achor. Notice the
[26:28] things Achen took. They were not idols.
[26:31] I believe he loved God and was dedicated
[26:34] to his people but he failed because he
[26:37] lusted after worldly goods. Right? So
[26:42] what God is protecting here the people
[26:45] from from doing is developing the the
[26:49] behavior or the desire to lust after
[26:53] worldly things. So when this gold and
[26:56] silver and precious stuff came in, it
[26:58] was collected and brought to the
[27:00] tabernacle and became the Lord's. Amen.
[27:04] This is beautiful. This is what it's
[27:06] going to take, saints, to become the
[27:09] tabernacle of the Lord God himself or
[27:12] the throne of God.
[27:15] All right. Number five, oil for light.
[27:18] Oil was an important part of the worship
[27:20] in the Bible and we know where this is
[27:22] going. Oil is a type of the Holy Ghost.
[27:24] Anybody knows that? But the people had
[27:26] to acquire the oil for the tabernacle.
[27:29] Why couldn't God make it the priest's
[27:31] duty to get the oil? I mean, these guys
[27:35] were the ones who who furnished or
[27:38] rather who took care of the tabernacle.
[27:39] Why couldn't they get the oil? Why take
[27:42] it from the people? Why not make the oil
[27:44] himself? [snorts] You know, God caused
[27:46] the the widow of Zarapath or Sarapa to
[27:50] have constant supply of three and a half
[27:52] years. So, he was God was more than able
[27:54] to supply his own oil for the light in
[27:57] the tabernacle.
[27:59] It seems that the people had to keep
[28:01] this tabernacle going by much of their
[28:04] own strength.
[28:06] The construction, preparation, and
[28:08] keeping of the tabernacle involved
[28:12] constant sacrifice,
[28:14] right? And light was necessary for the
[28:17] inner court because there was no natural
[28:19] light entering into this inner court. So
[28:21] light was necessary and we will soon
[28:24] learn why. But for now let's understand
[28:27] the fundamental thing that we are seeing
[28:29] here in all these points. It is
[28:32] sacrifice.
[28:35] Amen. To be the throne of God, to be the
[28:38] tabernacle of God, it takes constant
[28:42] sacrifice.
[28:44] God's not going to produce the oil. We
[28:46] have to bring the oil. Amen. And not
[28:51] even the priests. We have to bring the
[28:53] oil. We have to give this oil as a
[28:56] constant um uh uh uh offering to the
[29:00] tabernacle. Right? Let's look at point
[29:03] number six.
[29:06] Oil and spices for anointing and sweet
[29:09] incense.
[29:11] Now God seemed concerned even with
[29:14] smell.
[29:17] Beautiful. The spices were used to make
[29:21] an anointing for the priesthood.
[29:23] Anointing was an oil or a perfume that
[29:26] was poured upon all the priests. Right
[29:29] now the gentile church even misused this
[29:31] instruction. This was not again to
[29:34] enrich the church or to make the
[29:36] priesthood more important than others.
[29:39] There are true reasons that we need to
[29:41] find and we will do so. So the people
[29:44] even had to give up their most beautiful
[29:46] spices and fragrances for the priesthood
[29:49] again walking through the wilderness.
[29:52] Why would one actually need it? But
[29:54] there's a good reason. Now we will study
[29:56] later how that nobody was allowed to
[29:59] copy the scent of the priesthood or they
[30:02] would lose their lives. In other words,
[30:04] the priests of this tabernacle had to
[30:07] smell different from the rest of the
[30:10] people.
[30:12] Right now, you can imagine how this can
[30:15] be used. Ministers, pastors, prophets,
[30:18] preachers can use these scriptures to
[30:21] enforce how the people can just bring
[30:23] all the riches to them and it belongs to
[30:25] them. And you know, it's incredible. But
[30:28] there's real spiritual reasons here that
[30:31] are beyond
[30:33] natural
[30:34] uh lust for filthy lucer for money and
[30:38] for ambition and so on.
[30:42] Sacrifice.
[30:44] Here's another thing.
[30:46] Spices are rare. Spices are hard to
[30:49] combine. fragrances. Which means that
[30:51] when uh certain people walking through
[30:54] the wilderness in this company of
[30:56] Israelites would meet up with strangers
[30:59] or traders or merchants, they would
[31:02] trade with them and it would become
[31:04] something that was uh a man would give
[31:08] up something to obtain spices that were
[31:10] rare, knowing that he would then give
[31:13] this as a free will offering to the
[31:16] Lord. Amen.
[31:19] Spices were rare, hard to come by, very
[31:22] difficult to make. It required an
[31:25] apothecary or in our days a chemist,
[31:29] somebody who skilled in the science of
[31:31] chemistry or one skilled in the mixing
[31:34] of the chemicals. Once again, nobody was
[31:38] allowed to be better or above the
[31:40] tabernacle. Nobody was allowed to have
[31:43] this smell or a better smell than the
[31:45] smell of the tabernacle. Amen. And God
[31:48] was specific about this. Let's get to
[31:51] point number seven. Now God asked them
[31:54] for precious stones. All kinds of
[31:56] precious stones. And these stones were
[31:58] for the ephford and the breastplate.
[32:02] Now as if all that wasn't enough, gold,
[32:05] silver, precious cloth,
[32:07] oils, scents, spices. They even had to
[32:11] surrender precious stones for the making
[32:14] of the ephford and the breastplate of
[32:16] the high priest. This was not to make
[32:18] the high priest a rich man, but to bring
[32:21] a distinction between him
[32:26] and the other Levites. There had to be a
[32:29] distinction between him
[32:31] and the other the other priests of the
[32:34] tabernacle.
[32:36] God wanted this distinction to be made
[32:38] for they were to look to him as the
[32:41] intercessor of the atonement. He was not
[32:44] to be dressed like the other priests. He
[32:47] was supposed to wear the the the the the
[32:50] garments of the high priest. No one was
[32:53] allowed to wear anything even closely
[32:56] resembling the high priest. It would be
[32:59] death.
[33:01] Now saints, does God love precious
[33:04] rocks? Does God really love diamonds and
[33:07] jasper and sardius and topaz and onyx
[33:10] and carbuncle? Does God really need all
[33:13] these uh precious rocks? Does he care
[33:18] for them? No, saints. But these things
[33:20] are precious to humans and only because
[33:23] of sin, right? [clears throat]
[33:25] I mean, why why would you,
[33:28] if you really think about it, why would
[33:31] it be so important for us to have
[33:35] diamonds on our rings and our jewelry?
[33:40] They're basically rocks
[33:43] cut in a certain way to let light in and
[33:45] they look shiny and glinty and we stick
[33:47] them in metal and we think, "Wow, look
[33:50] at that. I look great." But you're just
[33:53] wearing a rock, man. It's just a rock
[33:55] from the earth. But the thing about it
[33:58] is that these rocks were deemed precious
[34:03] by men. And they are only deemed
[34:05] precious by men because of sin.
[34:10] these these rocks dwelling or or or
[34:14] being in the earth was serving a
[34:15] particular purpose for the earth. God
[34:18] didn't even want them to be removed and
[34:20] used in the way that man is using them
[34:22] today. But so now that they are being
[34:25] used, they are being mined, they are
[34:27] being gathered, God says, "Bring them
[34:30] in. Make them mine."
[34:33] God was making sure again that the
[34:35] people would not corrupt themselves in
[34:40] lust for worldly things, lust for
[34:43] wealth, for pride, for high status in
[34:46] society,
[34:48] for vanity. He did not want them to
[34:51] corrupt themselves with this. Okay,
[34:53] let's get to the eighth phrase. Make me
[34:56] a sanctuary. Now,
[35:00] this is a beautiful statement. Make me a
[35:03] sanctuary. I could go for a long time on
[35:06] this.
[35:10] God is not going to make a sanctuary for
[35:12] himself.
[35:14] He already did. If you if you look in
[35:16] the scriptures and and and when Steven
[35:19] said uh those famous words, what house
[35:22] shall you build me?
[35:25] That's not just a statement saying you
[35:27] can't give me anything. You can't make
[35:30] something out of wood and stone and iron
[35:33] and precious metals. That's saying that
[35:36] everything that you could possibly bring
[35:38] would not be sufficient
[35:41] to build a tabernacle or a house for the
[35:44] Lord.
[35:45] And at that time when Steven made that
[35:48] incredible statement
[35:50] um you could see that there were many
[35:54] houses and palaces built in the world
[35:57] that many people would have thought
[35:59] worthy of a god.
[36:02] But here in the wilderness, God is
[36:04] asking for these simple little things.
[36:07] Yes, there was gold. Yes, there was
[36:08] silver. But it was not a lot of things.
[36:11] But he brought it all in and made this
[36:13] crude little tabernacle. And this was
[36:15] the tabernacle, the temple of the Lord
[36:18] most high.
[36:21] God was making sure that they would not
[36:23] corrupt themselves.
[36:26] Right now, number eight, make me a
[36:31] sanctuary.
[36:33] This is important. God ordered them to
[36:36] build the sanctuary. He could have done
[36:38] it himself, but he was all to it was
[36:41] altogether a test of faith and humility.
[36:44] And I want us to focus on that point.
[36:47] Make me a sanctuary. See, God had them
[36:51] all collecting all these materials. They
[36:54] could have brought all the materials to
[36:56] him and he could have put it all
[36:58] together,
[36:59] right? And and and this tabernacle would
[37:03] have been built. He could have put it
[37:05] all together after they brought it all
[37:07] to him. But now after they bring it, he
[37:10] says, "Okay, now go about making up all
[37:13] the pieces of the of the furniturees,
[37:18] all the curtains, all the um borders.
[37:22] Now you go take all that has been
[37:25] brought and build it and make it up."
[37:29] And not just that, but now he's also
[37:31] asking them to design everything and
[37:34] build it again and again. What is this
[37:36] about? This is yet another test.
[37:39] Remember, every time they stopped for
[37:42] camp, they had to build up this
[37:43] tabernacle. Then when they would get
[37:46] moving again, they had to dismantle it.
[37:48] So again and again they had to be
[37:50] building up this tabernacle
[37:53] constantly in exactly the same way that
[37:56] he wanted it. Every single time it was
[38:00] taken apart and rebuilt, it had to be
[38:03] done according to the pattern. Right? So
[38:07] what is important in the statement is
[38:10] make me a sanctuary.
[38:13] You put it together. You design it
[38:16] according to something. And we're going
[38:17] to talk about that just now. But you put
[38:20] it together, you build it, you make up
[38:23] the You take the materials and you make
[38:25] up each piece
[38:27] and then you put the sanctuary together
[38:30] for me.
[38:33] Wow. Does this not look like a really
[38:36] spoiled god? He does nothing. He just
[38:41] tells you what to bring, then he tells
[38:43] you to design it, and then you must
[38:46] build it up. You must do it for him.
[38:50] Incredible, right? And we we want to see
[38:54] what all the spiritual application is
[38:56] there. Obviously, if you had to give
[38:58] these portions of scripture to an
[39:00] atheist or some other kind of religion,
[39:02] they look at at this and say, "You know
[39:05] what? you you guys, your revelation of
[39:08] God is just totally false.
[39:11] What kind of God are you serving if he
[39:13] loves all of these things? What I'm
[39:16] trying to draw your attention to is you
[39:18] and I have to recognize that God didn't
[39:20] do this because he enjoys collecting all
[39:25] of these materials that are precious to
[39:27] man. Absolutely not. There's a reason
[39:31] behind everything.
[39:33] Build me. Make me a sanctuary. You do
[39:37] it. You put it together. I want you to
[39:40] put it together. Right.
[39:43] Verse nine, or rather point number nine.
[39:46] Um, according to all that I show thee.
[39:49] So, you must put it together. And here's
[39:51] the next part of this mystery. According
[39:53] to all that I show thee. Now, show. The
[39:56] word show s h e w in the bible means to
[40:01] reveal.
[40:03] So this indicates two things, right? It
[40:06] has to be built or put together upon
[40:09] revelation or by revelation, right?
[40:13] Number two, now we can move that
[40:16] forward. Remember in Matthew when Jesus
[40:19] said, "Upon this rock, I will build my
[40:22] church." And brother Brandham nailed
[40:24] that down to Revelation. He will build
[40:27] the church upon revelation.
[40:30] Right. Number two, that revelation can
[40:33] only come from God himself. Remember
[40:35] Peter, flesh and blood hath not revealed
[40:38] this to you but my father which is in
[40:40] heaven and upon this rock I will build
[40:42] my church upon that foundation. Rock
[40:45] meaning foundation. So God is telling
[40:49] them make me a sanctuary according to
[40:52] how or what I will reveal to you. You
[40:56] cannot use another pattern. You cannot
[40:58] use your own idea.
[41:00] Even though he wants you to put it
[41:03] together, he wants it to be your
[41:05] sacrifice. You bring the materials, you
[41:08] bring the oil for anointing, you bring
[41:10] all the precious ointments, precious
[41:12] metals, precious cloths. You bring it,
[41:15] you design it, you put it together, but
[41:18] you have to use the pattern I reveal to
[41:21] you, not your own idea.
[41:24] This also indicates that Moses didn't
[41:27] look into heaven and see this amazing
[41:30] picture of angels and the most high
[41:33] sitting on some grandeear throne and he
[41:36] and Moses didn't look around and and and
[41:39] and say, "Wow, look at this pattern.
[41:41] There's a I can see a kind of outer
[41:44] court here or [clears throat]
[41:46] and I see a kind of inner court here and
[41:48] I see this gold would work well here and
[41:50] brass would work well there and so on
[41:52] and so on." No, God didn't show him a
[41:55] picture of heaven. God didn't show him
[41:59] uh you know
[42:02] how spirits live in a seventh dimension
[42:06] or God didn't show him a picture or uh
[42:10] some kind of graphic representation.
[42:13] God showed him a vision. We don't know
[42:16] what that vision was, but apparently God
[42:19] knew that Moses could take that vision
[42:22] and Moses had the ability to interpret
[42:25] that vision and apply it to the things
[42:27] that were available to his life and time
[42:33] or age. That means he wasn't going to
[42:36] try and build his tabernacle out of
[42:40] things that were not available at that
[42:42] time. He took the vision and applied it
[42:46] to what was available to his life and to
[42:51] that age to that time. It was therefore
[42:54] done according to specifications of
[42:57] revelation.
[42:59] Amen.
[43:01] So you build me, you make me a
[43:04] sanctuary, but here's my specifications
[43:07] and it must be based upon revelation.
[43:10] Now there's a good reason for this which
[43:12] brings us to point number 10.
[43:15] Follow the pattern of everything. Those
[43:18] are the words. So verse 9 is basically
[43:21] telling us you must have faith to see,
[43:25] right? They had to have faith to see if
[43:27] they could build by revelation.
[43:31] Now remember, they had to constantly
[43:33] take it down, put it up, take it down,
[43:34] put it up, take it down, put up.
[43:36] Wherever they stopped, whenever they
[43:37] started moving, that was the process.
[43:40] every time they put it back up together.
[43:42] It had to be done by revelation
[43:45] and follow instruction.
[43:47] Do not lean to your own understanding.
[43:50] If they built it according to their own
[43:52] way, it would have also brought pride.
[43:56] So imagine if they designed this
[43:59] tabernacle and each and a man could say,
[44:02] "I designed it according to my design."
[44:04] It's like people's churches today. You
[44:06] know, when when you have a church that
[44:08] is built, you have a little plaque in
[44:10] the wall saying this was the the founder
[44:12] and he was the co-founder and he was the
[44:14] designer and this was a vision in the
[44:16] heart of this man and the glory is given
[44:19] to a certain man who built this certain
[44:21] church. Nobody could claim the glory for
[44:25] the tabernacle. Even if the furnishings,
[44:29] the instruments, the vessels, the altar,
[44:31] the labor, even the clothes of the
[44:33] priesthood, even if all of it came from
[44:36] materials that they had given as an
[44:38] offering,
[44:40] the design, the pattern was God given,
[44:44] it was not their idea. The design of God
[44:48] was unlike
[44:50] any way that any man would have thought
[44:53] of.
[44:55] Right? It had to be all revelation and
[45:00] faith. Saints, I want you to notice
[45:02] that. Make me a sanctuary according to
[45:06] the pattern of everything I will show
[45:08] you. Now, how often do we in our lives
[45:12] follow our own order and design? I mean,
[45:14] just just look around. How are you
[45:16] living your life today? Look around at
[45:18] our message churches. Look at look at
[45:20] the standards that we keep. Look at the
[45:23] the important the things we deem are
[45:25] important to our churches. Look at the
[45:28] things that we stress. Look at the
[45:30] things that we keep people bound by for
[45:34] so long. How often do we follow our own
[45:37] order and design?
[45:40] All right, which brings me to point
[45:42] number 11. And the title of this sermon,
[45:48] that I may dwell among them.
[45:52] Make me a sanctuary that I may dwell
[45:55] among them. Precious Lord
[46:00] saints, God's sole purpose
[46:04] was so that he could dwell amongst the
[46:06] people. Everything that he was asking
[46:08] them to do was so that he could dwell
[46:11] amongst them. Right? Was it that he
[46:15] needed all these precious things? No.
[46:19] So why bring all these things? Why go
[46:22] through this hardship to bring all these
[46:24] things together? It was to keep the
[46:27] people in line. How?
[46:31] Here's the answer. To never allow the
[46:34] spirit of pride into the sanctuary.
[46:37] Everything that we've been through right
[46:39] now is all about eliminating pride.
[46:43] Notice why God said David was a man
[46:46] after his own heart. Because David,
[46:49] though a man who sinned, he loved the
[46:52] Lord far more than himself.
[46:56] Amen. David loved the Lord more than he
[46:59] loved David. He was so affected when he
[47:01] saw that the tabernacle of the Lord was
[47:04] lesser in value than his own palace.
[47:08] David truly loved the Lord and worshiped
[47:10] him with all his heart. Therefore, when
[47:13] he saw his words were, "How could the
[47:15] king live in this and the Lord live in
[47:18] that?"
[47:20] See, so he had this the right feeling or
[47:25] the right spirit in his heart to do it.
[47:27] But of course, we know the story. God
[47:29] wouldn't let him do it. God does not
[47:32] need such earthly splendor, saints. God
[47:35] doesn't need precious stones and
[47:38] precious metals and cloth. I mean, just
[47:41] look at us today.
[47:43] We look, we know where this series is
[47:45] heading. You're going to say, "Well,
[47:47] Brother Alistister, I believe you're
[47:49] going to end up with us being the throne
[47:52] right now.
[47:55] God does not need you to be a professor
[47:58] of law. He doesn't need you to be a
[48:01] theologian. He doesn't need you to be
[48:04] some great speaker that can stand in the
[48:06] street and
[48:09] blast out the word in the most eloquent
[48:12] speech. He doesn't need you to display
[48:17] gold and silver
[48:19] uh that carnal man lusts after. He
[48:23] doesn't need you to do all these things.
[48:26] When he just think about this when he
[48:28] came to dwell among us as Emmanuel. He
[48:31] came in a body without splendor in a
[48:34] body that men would not even recognize
[48:37] him because they were better looking.
[48:40] They were better looking. They were
[48:41] wealthier. They were better smelling and
[48:44] they were of better lineages.
[48:48] Everything about Christ was unattractive
[48:50] as compared with Caiaphas the high
[48:53] priest, Herod the Great, Barabus,
[48:58] the the scribes and Pharisees and
[49:00] Sadducees and even some of the
[49:03] publicans. Christ was born into the
[49:06] family of a carpenter.
[49:09] Let's read Isaiah 53:2 to3. For he shall
[49:12] grow up before him as a tender plant and
[49:15] as a root out of dry ground. He has no
[49:18] form nor clliness. And when we shall see
[49:22] him, there is no beauty that we should
[49:24] desire him. He is despised and rejected
[49:27] of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted
[49:29] with grief. And we hid as it were our
[49:32] faces from him. He was despised and we
[49:34] esteemed him not.
[49:38] Saints, when this throne, the Lord Jesus
[49:41] Christ, this tabernacle of God stood
[49:44] upon the earth,
[49:46] were those carninal men really seeing
[49:48] the gold and silver,
[49:51] the precious ointment of anointing that
[49:54] was upon him? Were they really
[49:56] recognizing it?
[49:59] They actually didn't see that. They were
[50:01] looking to the outer
[50:03] parts of him. They and and therefore
[50:06] because he was not dressed as a high
[50:08] priest, they may have even respected him
[50:11] as a rabbi but were very disappointed
[50:15] with his appearance
[50:19] and how he conducted himself
[50:22] and uh the company with which he kept
[50:26] and the places he would sit and mix with
[50:29] the general people, the common people.
[50:34] They could not understand these things.
[50:37] So notice saints, this Emmanuel, this
[50:41] tabernacle that God eventually chose to
[50:43] dwell in to live among the people.
[50:47] Remember that this point,
[50:50] point number 11, that I may dwell among
[50:52] them. What is Emanuel? God with us.
[50:57] But when he came in the tabernacle of
[50:59] Christ,
[51:01] because the people had no humility,
[51:05] they showed no respect unto that great
[51:08] tabernacle, that great vessel, that body
[51:11] that stood. They took him and crucified
[51:13] him. They whipped him and scourged him
[51:15] and teased him and mocked him. They spat
[51:19] on him. They plucked out his beard. They
[51:21] pierced his side. They kicked him in the
[51:24] streets. They made him like a slave to
[51:27] carry his own cross
[51:31] saints because they had no humility
[51:34] because pride was elevated to such a
[51:37] level in their lives. Wealth and
[51:39] pleasures of life had robbed them of
[51:41] their sight. Notice all those who
[51:44] recognized him were those who esteemed
[51:46] themselves lower. Blind Bottomas, woman
[51:50] at the well, the woman of the blood
[51:52] issue, Zakius the tax collector.
[51:56] Notice all these people were people who
[51:59] esteem themselves lower,
[52:03] right?
[52:04] Notice even Nathaniel
[52:07] when Nathaniel spoke of Christ or when
[52:10] when Nathaniel was told come and see
[52:12] this man he was he was even expecting
[52:16] Christ to come out of some royal
[52:18] lineage.
[52:20] He said can anything good come out of
[52:23] Nazareth?
[52:25] knowing that nothing good comes out of
[52:27] Nazareth, that it was a lower class
[52:30] community, that it was a a class of
[52:32] community of people with lower morals
[52:35] and things like that. He knowing these
[52:37] things, he asked that question. And yet
[52:40] when he came, he immediately saw and
[52:44] recognized because the first thing
[52:46] Christ said to him was, "Behold an
[52:49] Israelite in whom there is no guile."
[52:52] Which means all these people who
[52:54] recognized him were people who had
[52:57] character within them that had no pride
[52:59] or vanity.
[53:03] So saints, what is expected of us today?
[53:07] What are the precious things to us in
[53:09] life that we have to give to God? How do
[53:12] we esteem him higher than us? What is
[53:15] your gold? What is your silver? What is
[53:19] your brass? What is your precious cloth?
[53:23] What are your precious stones?
[53:26] What is your blue and purple and
[53:28] scarlet?
[53:31] Amen. What is your oil for light? What
[53:34] is your oil for spices for anoint for
[53:38] anointing? Your oil and spices for
[53:40] anointing. What is that? What is your
[53:42] sweet smelling savor that you can bring?
[53:46] What sacrifices do we have to m to be a
[53:50] part of his great throne?
[53:53] What do you have to do with your life
[53:55] saints that he may dwell among us?
[54:02] Is it really keeping a message church?
[54:06] If anything, this corona virus lockdown
[54:08] has proved to us that it's not that
[54:11] building.
[54:12] It's not that church. It's not going to
[54:14] a building and assembling together and
[54:17] becoming as other people having some
[54:21] great church building with pews and
[54:24] organs and great fineries and music and
[54:27] great cloths and design of clothing and
[54:31] uh fancy suits and dresses that we wear.
[54:34] It's not that
[54:37] what sacrifices do we have
[54:42] that to bring? What sacrifices do we
[54:45] have to make to become a part of the
[54:47] throne of God?
[54:50] That's what we're going to find in this
[54:52] series. We're going to take each room,
[54:55] the most holy place, the inner court,
[54:58] the outer court. We're going to look at
[55:00] the the most holy place. We're going to
[55:02] look at the ark of the testimony, the
[55:04] golden pot that was there, the mercy
[55:07] seat, the room itself. We're going to
[55:10] move outward and look at the veil. We're
[55:13] going to look at the altar of incense
[55:16] made of wood overlaid with gold. We're
[55:19] going to look at the table of shoebre
[55:22] and the bread that was upon it. We're
[55:24] going to look at the seven golden
[55:26] candlesticks and the oil that was in it
[55:28] and the light that was supposed to never
[55:31] go out.
[55:33] We're going to go out of that to look at
[55:36] the brazen labor, the the dish of brass
[55:39] in which was water that was cleansing,
[55:43] that was for sanctification, that was
[55:45] for cleaning. We're going to go further
[55:47] out and look at the brazen altar.
[55:51] And we're going to look at all the
[55:53] things that these things symbolize,
[55:55] saints. And you then even to the very
[55:59] outer part of it, the skins that were
[56:02] used to form the barrier, the outer
[56:05] court, the knops
[56:08] and what all these things were made of
[56:11] and the specifications
[56:13] and the sacrifices that were brought in.
[56:16] We're going to look at all these things
[56:18] and study them in detail
[56:22] and ask ourselves what is it that we
[56:25] have to bring? What is it that we have
[56:28] to lay down? What is it that we have to
[56:30] make? What design is there? What
[56:33] revelation can we have? Are we putting
[56:36] our lives together based on the right
[56:39] pattern?
[56:41] Do we really think we are the temple of
[56:43] the Holy Ghost because we go to church,
[56:46] we pay our tithes, we speak with
[56:48] tongues, we prophesy. Is that the
[56:50] pattern?
[56:52] Is that the revelation
[56:54] uh required for this day?
[56:58] Have you produced a tabernacle that is
[57:02] most precious?
[57:04] that you have given your all
[57:09] for him to dwell among us.
[57:13] How serious can we take those things?
[57:17] Amen. I believe it's going to be a real
[57:19] wonderful study. I believe the Lord will
[57:21] reveal many personal things to us in
[57:24] this series and I trust that you will
[57:27] take this this scripture, read it
[57:30] through, make it personal.
[57:33] Make it personal to you saints. Look at
[57:36] the things that the Lord required. Let's
[57:39] look at our lives. Look at each phrase
[57:42] before I even take a few months to to go
[57:45] through all this with you. Search our
[57:48] hearts. Search our souls.
[57:51] Search your mind. Search your thoughts.
[57:53] Search your intentions.
[57:56] Look at your family around you. Look at
[57:58] your home. Look at your church. Look at
[58:01] your community.
[58:03] Look at your school, your job. Look at
[58:05] the things you have chosen. Look at the
[58:08] life path you have chosen. Look at the
[58:10] decisions you have made. All of these
[58:12] things have to do with the sacrifice
[58:16] that you say, you make that he may dwell
[58:20] among us.
[58:23] This is the tabernacle of Moses. A
[58:26] tabernacle that I may dwell among them.
[58:29] God's purpose from before the foundation
[58:32] of the world, the purpose of all
[58:34] purposes
[58:36] was that he would dwell
[58:39] in his sons and daughters.
[58:44] And he's going to bring that full
[58:45] redemption to a full manifestation to an
[58:49] end. He's going to bring it to a
[58:50] completion. And there will be a people,
[58:54] there is a people, amen, that have
[58:57] chosen the way of right, that have
[58:59] chosen the way of truth, that will be
[59:02] the tabernacle of the most high God.
[59:06] Amen. The Lord bless you, saints. Until
[59:08] the next time, I trust that you would
[59:11] have enjoyed this part of the
[59:13] introduction
[59:14] and that you would really use the
[59:17] anointing that the the Holy Spirit
[59:18] brings upon you, the conviction of your
[59:20] hearts and look deep inside yourselves
[59:24] to understand, to believe,
[59:27] to be able to put aside from us the
[59:30] spirit of pride and vanity
[59:32] and hottiness
[59:35] and humble ourselves to become become
[59:38] the very tabernacle of God that he may
[59:40] dwell among us. The Lord bless you. Till
[59:44] the next time.
