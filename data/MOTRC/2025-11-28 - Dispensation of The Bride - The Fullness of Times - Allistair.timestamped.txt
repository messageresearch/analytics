[0:00] Amen.
[0:01] &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. So that's where we are
[0:03] right now. The dispensation of the
[0:06] bride. God is no more above us,
[0:09] invisible pillar of fire, pillar of
[0:11] cloud. God is no longer Jesus Christ
[0:14] from 2,000 years ago. GOD IS NO LONGER
[0:17] JUST HOLY GHOST, BAPTISM, ANOINTINGS,
[0:20] HEALINGS, MIRACLES, DISCERNMENTS, all
[0:22] those kind of things. GOD IS NO LONGER
[0:24] JUST THOSE THINGS. God is now becoming
[0:28] his bride.
[0:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; His people, WHICH WAS THE ORIGINAL PLAN
[0:35] FROM THE BEGINNING of the story of God
[0:38] and man. He created man for this
[0:41] purpose. AND THIS IS THE TRIAL of people
[0:45] today because your sin, your mistakes,
[0:48] your problems. This is a reason why
[0:50] pastors and ministers can't accept this
[0:53] coming
[0:54] BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ACCEPT THAT GOD can
[0:56] be you.
[0:58] &gt;&gt; WHY? WHY CAN'T YOU ACCEPT THAT GOD CAN
[1:01] BE YOU? Number one is your definition of
[1:03] God.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; That's your main problem. You don't
[1:08] understand the mystery of God. YOU THINK
[1:11] GOD IS JUST AN OBJECT OF WORSHIP TO WHOM
[1:14] others must bow down, sing, and pray to.
[1:20] That's the starting point. If you don't
[1:22] know what God is, you could never be
[1:23] him.
[1:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; And that's why they they criticize us
[1:28] and TELL US LIKE, I DON'T KNOW. WHY ARE
[1:31] YOU IN THE MESSAGE THEN? WHY NOT JUST GO
[1:33] TO DENOMINATION? WHAT ARE YOU HEARING
[1:36] THE MESSAGE? BECAUSE THE MESSAGE TELLS
[1:37] US THIS.
[1:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; THIS VERY THING
[1:40] &gt;&gt; THAT THIS IS WHAT WE WERE CHOSEN FOR.
[1:44] &gt;&gt; LIKE I I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE PREACHING
[1:45] THE SEVENTH SEAL. WHY TALKING ABOUT IT
[1:48] AND USING BUZZWORDS? WHY READING THE
[1:49] SCRIPTURE? WHY TALKING ABOUT IT IF you
[1:51] don't believe it? JUST LET IT GO AND
[1:54] WALK AWAY.
[1:57] AMEN. This is the fullness of times. The
[2:01] fullness
[2:03] means the maximum.
[2:06] It means to come to complete maturity.
[2:09] It therefore refers to the age of
[2:11] adopted sons, manifested sons.
[2:16] THOSE WHO WERE BECOMING SONS ARE NOW
[2:18] become sons.
[2:22] And yes,
[2:24] this is this is the mediocre
[2:28] limp noodle
[2:31] arguments
[2:33] that I get. Oh, if you're a son, where's
[2:36] the power of spoken word? Why aren't you
[2:39] speaking things into existence?
[2:42] Well, I'm like, I wish I could SPEAK
[2:43] YOUR STUPIDITY OUT OF EXISTENCE.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; That's where I am right now.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS IS ALL
[2:53] ABOUT. WE'RE NOT HERE to go and make
[2:56] miracles because we know it's already
[2:58] been told us that in the Bible that that
[3:02] that that power that beast power coming
[3:05] out of the earth is GOING TO GO OFF and
[3:08] and deceive the whole world WITH
[3:09] MIRACLES AND CAUSE FIRE TO COME out from
[3:11] heaven. What what are we doing? Trying
[3:14] to fight back with that beast. This is
[3:18] the time where I mean
[3:21] why do you need to go and speak things
[3:24] into existence when you can't even deal
[3:28] with your own marriage
[3:31] &gt;&gt; or your children or your house or get
[3:35] some good accounting so you pay your
[3:38] bills
[3:39] &gt;&gt; and don't run short. You want to manage
[3:42] God's kingdom and speak things into
[3:43] existence. You can't even manage your
[3:45] own budget.
[3:49] THIS IS THE PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS IS
[3:52] IMMATURITY.
[3:55] What are we waiting for? OH, I CAN'T
[3:56] WAIT, BROTHER. WHEN I GET THE POWER OF
[3:59] GOD, I'M GOING TO SPEAK THINGS INTO
[4:00] EXISTENCE. YEAH.
[4:03] You think you got the solution for the
[4:04] world? I'm going to speak this out of
[4:06] existence. I'm going to solve the
[4:08] world's problems. It's like a grandiose
[4:10] narcissistic thinking like I need to
[4:13] solve everyone's problems so they look
[4:14] at us and see oh the bride.
[4:17] Oh the sons of God. Look at them how
[4:19] beautiful they are. They're our saviors.
[4:21] We love them.
[4:24] No.
[4:26] You saw what they did with Christ.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; He was all that.
[4:30] &gt;&gt; They hated him. They nashed their teeth
[4:32] at him. They spent night and day
[4:35] conspiring. How are we going to get him?
[4:37] How are we going to kill him? HOW ARE WE
[4:38] GOING TO PROVE THAT HE'S THIS? HOW ARE
[4:40] WE GOING TO PROVE THAT HE'S AN that he's
[4:42] a antichrist? That he's not the Messiah?
[4:44] Can you imagine such men obsessed?
[4:48] You know, like, man, just take a break.
[4:51] Go do some gardening.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; Go milk THE COWS.
[4:57] THEY'RE SO OBSESSED LIKE THEY ARE TODAY
[5:01] frothing at the mouth, you know, like
[5:03] like foot and mouth disease or
[5:05] something. THAT'S WHAT IT'S LIKE. IT'S
[5:07] LIKE
[5:09] LET'S GO HAVE COFFEE AND DISCUSS HOW WE
[5:11] CAN TAKE THEM DOWN.
[5:15] &gt;&gt; It's really maniacal. I don't know. To
[5:17] me, I all these anti- message people. I
[5:20] don't even know what's the big deal. Why
[5:22] don't just leave us alone? We don't even
[5:24] make a dent in the world. We're not even
[5:27] like a billion people. We're not even
[5:30] like millions of people. Nobody listens
[5:32] to us. Nobody takes us seriously
[5:34] anymore. And when they see us, they, oh,
[5:36] you're that group. Okay,
[5:38] nice to see you. Bye. Now,
[5:41] nobody wants to listen to us. We are
[5:43] totally rejected. WE'RE NOT EVEN TRYING
[5:45] TO GET INTO your homes. We're not even
[5:48] trying to live rentree in your heads.
[5:50] What's going on?
[5:52] Why not just let us be? You know, let us
[5:54] be. Let us go away and fade away in our
[5:57] madness like you say.
[6:00] No, they got to go on the internet and
[6:01] blast us and lambaste us and shame us
[6:04] and go take down our churches and call
[6:06] us cults and we're not even doing
[6:08] anything. We're not even fighting back.
[6:11] It's like every time you beat us, we're
[6:14] just And then you beat us again.
[6:18] I don't understand.
[6:21] Actually, I do.
[6:25] When something
[6:27] convicts you and you know it's right and
[6:31] you know it's nagging at you, you can't
[6:34] let it go.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; You have to find a way to prove it wrong
[6:38] for yourself.
[6:41] &gt;&gt; That's the problem.
[6:42] &gt;&gt; We're not pushing it at you. I mean,
[6:44] this this humble man made so many
[6:46] mistakes, grammatical errors. He said
[6:49] some things here this way, another thing
[6:51] here that way and this that way.
[6:53] this prophecy was spoken in this fashion
[6:55] here and later on he spoke it in this
[6:57] way slightly different to that. I mean
[6:59] you could go you get so exhausted. I'm
[7:02] telling you sitting with them and
[7:05] talking this out and being an apologist
[7:07] is just the wrong thing to don't even
[7:09] get into that. There's there's
[7:11] absolutely no reason. In fact, if anyone
[7:14] comes up to you and they anti- William
[7:15] Brandon, just say yes, I agree with you.
[7:17] Walk away. Yes, you're right. Wow.
[7:22] and walk away. SHAKE HANDS. GOD BLESS
[7:25] YOU, MAN. You're the greatest. Walk
[7:27] away.
[7:29] That's all. Just take the whole poke the
[7:32] balloon and take all the air out because
[7:35] you're not going to get anywhere. THEY
[7:36] ARE TRYING TO FIGHT back to prove it to
[7:39] themselves
[7:41] to make them feel good about the lives
[7:43] they're living because that word is
[7:45] convicting them.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; It's killing them.
[7:52] That's just what that's the truth. You
[7:54] young people, anyone when you come to me
[7:57] and question me on the message and the
[7:59] prophet and start to tell me it's false,
[8:01] believe me, I know what's happening in
[8:03] your head. It's convicting you. You want
[8:05] to do stuff, but you feel like the
[8:07] message is preventing you from doing
[8:08] that's all.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[8:10] &gt;&gt; This is how this is how humans work.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; If they want to do something, you really
[8:14] want to do it, go do it. Go do it. Go
[8:18] see what happens after that. then come
[8:19] back. We'll still be here
[8:22] except you'll just come back a little
[8:23] bit dented and cut and bruised and not
[8:26] the same as you you would be if you
[8:28] didn't go there.
[8:30] See that? That's what I'm saying. But
[8:32] when you come to me and start attacking
[8:34] a man of God who dedicated his life to
[8:36] the word, who had manifestations of the
[8:39] word of God in his life, of the pillar
[8:41] of fire, of a whole lot of other things,
[8:44] and maybe he spoke in some weird way
[8:47] that doesn't make sense to you and said
[8:48] inconsistent things, but you're fighting
[8:51] back against it because it's
[8:53] inconvenient to you. Then just be
[8:55] honest.
[8:57] say, "I don't I want to do stuff, you
[9:00] know, brother Al. I want to go out and
[9:02] enjoy my life and, you know, I want to
[9:04] get a couple of girlfriends and see how
[9:06] that works out. Go, man.
[9:11] GO HAVE FUN. GO FIND YOURSELF. We'll
[9:14] still be here."
[9:16] I can't tell you how many times it has
[9:18] happened.
[9:20] You know, you get some some young man
[9:23] and tell me, "Oh, brother Al, I crossed
[9:24] the line."
[9:26] Really? You crossed the line
[9:30] or you want to?
[9:36] You want me to tell you it's okay. You
[9:39] should not be in our church anymore. You
[9:41] want it to be my fault that you leave.
[9:44] Just be a man. Get a spine man. Leave.
[9:49] Say, "I'm I'm making this DECISION FOR
[9:51] MYSELF. I'M GOING. I want to figure it
[9:52] out. I be honest. I'll respect you. But
[9:55] don't come here and make me chase you
[9:57] out
[10:00] so that you can say they chase me out.
[10:05] No, we need men. We need real men and
[10:08] women today who can can have a real
[10:10] spine and take responsibility for their
[10:12] actions.
[10:14] Are you with us?
[10:16] &gt;&gt; So the fullness of time means the
[10:18] maximum of times the maturity of times.
[10:21] What does this mean? THIS MEANS THAT ALL
[10:23] THIS is the dispensation.
[10:25] This dispensation where all the
[10:27] covenants that have not been fulfilled.
[10:31] This is not the dispensation of the
[10:33] fullness of time.
[10:36] This is the dispensation of the fullness
[10:38] of times.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. In other words, it's the fullness
[10:42] of the time of Noah, the fullness of the
[10:45] time of Abraham, the fullness of the
[10:47] time of Moses, the fullness of In other
[10:49] words, it's coming to its maximum. All
[10:52] the covenants that were not realized
[10:55] are going to be realized.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses,
[11:02] the first coming of Christ, THE CHURCH,
[11:04] ALL MANIFESTATIONS there in the past,
[11:07] ALL THE COVENANTS ARE BEING fulfilled
[11:09] now. This is the fullness of times
[11:13] plural.
[11:15] Amen. Are you are you with me, saints?
[11:17] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 1:10 did not say the fullness
[11:20] of time. It said the fullness of times
[11:22] plural. Let's read. Who is this
[11:24] MelkiseDC? All right, buckle your seat
[11:26] belts.
[11:28] This one just puts it all together for
[11:31] us. Notice like the sculpture, he hides
[11:35] with a mask over it. That's what God has
[11:38] done to this age. It's been hid. It's
[11:42] supposed to be revealed in this age.
[11:45] Now, the Bible says they will be
[11:48] revealed in the latter times. It's like
[11:51] a sculptor keeping his piece of work all
[11:54] covered until the time he takes the mask
[11:57] off. And there it is.
[11:59] &gt;&gt; You with us?
[12:01] &gt;&gt; And that's what the Bible has been. It's
[12:05] been a work of God that's been covered
[12:07] up. It's been hid since the foundation
[12:10] of the world. And it's sevenfold
[12:13] mystery. AND GOD PROMISED IN THIS day at
[12:18] the age of this Leodysian age, he would
[12:21] take the mask off the whole thing and we
[12:24] could see it.
[12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a glorious thing. God and
[12:29] Morphe masked in the pillar of fire.
[12:32] Where are we? Oh, you you changed it.
[12:34] Are we together? Paragraph 43. God and
[12:37] Morphe mosque in the pillar of fire.
[12:41] Got it.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; God and Morphe in a man called Jesus.
[12:46] God and Morphe masked.
[12:50] &gt;&gt; Masked in a man called Jesus.
[12:54] God in Morphe in his church. And there
[12:57] it is. God above us, God with us, God in
[13:02] us, the condescending God.
[13:06] Condescending does not mean he looks
[13:08] down on you. Like the modern, this is
[13:12] the prophet's meaning of condescending
[13:14] means losing a previous state to take on
[13:18] a lower one. To take on a lower one.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; That's what he means by that. Are you
[13:22] with us?
[13:23] &gt;&gt; So we go back to Ephesians 1:10
[13:26] which says that in the dispensation of
[13:28] the fullness of times he might gather
[13:30] together in one all things in Christ.
[13:32] All right. So did you see? Now I want
[13:34] you to do this
[13:36] when you go back home. Some of you
[13:39] students of the scripture uh and the
[13:42] message. Go back and look at this
[13:44] previous one which is God above us, God
[13:48] with us, God in us. Go and type it into
[13:50] your table or whatever word word
[13:53] searches you have and search for that
[13:55] God above us, God with us, God in us.
[13:58] You will come up with a treasure trove
[14:01] of the same statement with so much more
[14:05] revelation in it. I don't have the time
[14:06] to do it. Maybe one of you can pick it
[14:08] up and preach that those three vers
[14:12] those three phrases, but go have a look
[14:14] at it. So that's why I'm telling you
[14:15] everything I told you is from the
[14:17] message. God above, God with us, God in
[14:21] us. You I think there's one quote where
[14:23] it even speaks about God in us becoming
[14:26] manifested sons.
[14:30] &gt;&gt; I I I think it's there. So go have a
[14:32] look at it. All right. So let's go to
[14:33] fullness of times. Gather together in
[14:35] one all things in Christ. So number one,
[14:38] gather together in one all things in
[14:40] Christ. Now let's go through this
[14:41] quickly. What is gather together? Easy,
[14:44] right? Unite.
[14:46] bring it all together. Gathering.
[14:50] Okay. He's not uniting all things uh uh
[14:56] like uniting all things in Christ. The
[14:59] So the question is what is in Christ?
[15:02] Right? So when we say uniting, most
[15:05] people think of, you know, we're all
[15:06] agreeing,
[15:09] right? That that's like something that
[15:12] never happens. You can never get people
[15:14] all gathered together and agreeing,
[15:17] but you can gather together, right? So,
[15:19] let's bring it all in. What is Christ?
[15:23] Christ is the manifested word,
[15:27] &gt;&gt; the word made flesh. So, what is God
[15:29] doing? He's gathering everything
[15:32] together in the word made flesh.
[15:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; Christ means Messiah. The Messiah is the
[15:40] word manifested. So what was the word?
[15:43] The word was the logos who WAS HAD ALL
[15:47] THE ATTRIBUTES IN HIM,
[15:50] RIGHT? THE ATTRIBUTES OF HIMSELF. SO GOD
[15:52] IS GATHERING all the attributes of
[15:54] himself that were in the logos. He's
[15:56] gathering it together in Christ. That
[16:00] means in the word made flesh.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; Sons of God that shouted for joy as
[16:06] attribute form are now coming together
[16:08] in flesh form. They are being gathered
[16:11] together. Not all coming to one place.
[16:14] No one's running to Jeffersonville.
[16:16] No one's running to No. Gathering
[16:18] together means bringing them around the
[16:21] revealed word.
[16:23] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:25] &gt;&gt; Man, we can literally be miles apart,
[16:28] but we are together.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it also means all the
[16:34] attributes to one new revelation of
[16:38] himself.
[16:40] And you can see that Revelations 5, when
[16:42] the lamb took the book, they sang a new
[16:44] song. Is that right?
[16:47] A new song, a new worship,
[16:50] a worship beyond the New Testament.
[16:55] This is the lamb taking the book. A new
[16:57] song is going to be sung because the the
[17:00] book is going to be brought down by the
[17:02] lamb. The seals have been broken off.
[17:05] The Bible becomes a new book. The mosque
[17:09] is pulled off.
[17:12] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[17:14] &gt;&gt; And that happens right there in that
[17:16] Leodysian church age. When that seventh
[17:18] seal is being broke, the mighty angel
[17:20] descends, the seventh seal is open, the
[17:23] book comes down, the mosque is pulled
[17:26] off, seven seals are broken,
[17:30] the book is revealed.
[17:32] Amen. So that one revelation is not by a
[17:36] certain doctrine but by his personal
[17:39] visitation to each believer.
[17:43] Are we together?
[17:46] &gt;&gt; Why are we together
[17:48] in Christ?
[17:51] How is everyone going to get that one
[17:53] revelation?
[17:56] He has to come to each person. Yes.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; It's not going to be one brother
[18:02] preaching a certain way or one
[18:05] revelation being preached or series
[18:07] being taught by some person. No, he's
[18:11] going to do this through multiple men in
[18:13] the ministry of Christ. And he's going
[18:16] to visit each individual under all those
[18:20] ministries.
[18:21] There'll be others under those same
[18:23] ministries that will not get it.
[18:26] God will visit each individual who is a
[18:29] part of that
[18:32] and they will be brought together under
[18:34] that one revelation.
[18:36] &gt;&gt; All right, let's look at this highlight
[18:38] the next part of it. Now we go to things
[18:40] which are in heaven and which are on
[18:42] earth even in him. So notice he doesn't
[18:46] say things under the earth
[18:50] on earth, right?
[18:52] He's not bringing those uh under the
[18:56] earth is a phrase meaning the fifth
[18:58] dimension.
[18:59] &gt;&gt; Okay. So we we're not bringing things in
[19:03] that's in the fifth dimension. Things on
[19:05] earth and things which are in heaven.
[19:08] Nothing anymore of Christ in the
[19:11] dimension that was once called under the
[19:13] earth. There is nothing.
[19:15] &gt;&gt; Right? In other words, there's no more
[19:17] bosom of Abraham.
[19:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:20] &gt;&gt; Got it. There's no paradise in the fifth
[19:21] dimension. There's nothing there
[19:22] anymore. It's all been emptied out.
[19:24] Right? So attributes that were in the
[19:28] what what what are we talking about? The
[19:30] closing of the story of God and man,
[19:33] right? All the attributes from the
[19:35] beginning
[19:37] through this dispensation have been sown
[19:42] over time. Now we come to the
[19:44] dispensation, the fullness of times
[19:46] where all things MUST COME TOGETHER. ALL
[19:49] they without us cannot be made perfect.
[19:53] &gt;&gt; We are now the closing stage. Right? So
[19:57] the attributes that were in the word
[19:59] before the foundation of the world have
[20:00] been expressed on earth. Some were taken
[20:03] up to heaven which are the heavenly
[20:06] attributes still there as well as the
[20:07] attributes of him the bridegroom
[20:09] himself.
[20:12] Then there are attributes of the word
[20:14] who are in living vessels on earth right
[20:16] now. So that which is in heaven during
[20:20] this dispensation that comes to earth by
[20:23] the opening of the seventh seal with the
[20:25] attributes of the bridegroom, those
[20:28] attributes of the saints of old, those
[20:30] who died before us. They are basically
[20:32] the word that was manifested in the
[20:34] past.
[20:38] Some of them were foreshadows of Christ.
[20:40] Some of them came after Christ and have
[20:42] died. HE'S BRINGING THEM ALL together in
[20:46] one by the opening of the seventh seal
[20:51] by the mighty angel descending in him.
[20:54] It ends with in him which is in the
[20:56] logos that began it all. He was heaven.
[21:00] He became earth. They are now attributes
[21:03] in heaven who have lived through the
[21:04] times and been called on by him. God has
[21:07] taken them home. But in the dispensation
[21:10] of the fullness of times there will
[21:12] there will uh the last attributes on
[21:14] earth for the completion of all things
[21:17] in Christ. That's where we are right
[21:19] now. Gathering all things together in
[21:21] him means bringing all the attributes in
[21:24] the revealed word for that dispensation.
[21:27] It is a new ruling system of governance.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[21:32] &gt;&gt; There is new governance.
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. The government shall be upon his
[21:37] shoulder. He is good about the paps.
[21:42] No longer about the loins.
[21:44] &gt;&gt; He's now good about the paps. He's the
[21:46] judge.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; There's a new system of government. And
[21:50] when we say that,
[21:52] do you realize we are no longer the
[21:54] church?
[21:55] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[21:56] &gt;&gt; I no longer call you church. I call you
[21:58] bride. So you understand
[22:02] what what's different about the church?
[22:04] We are not just the called out ones
[22:07] anymore.
[22:08] Amen.
[22:10] &gt;&gt; We are not just people who are keeping
[22:12] traditions of Christianity and and
[22:14] keeping of footwashing and communion and
[22:17] keeping of of ordinances of baptisms and
[22:20] and all kinds of traditions and things.
[22:23] We're not just about that. There's new
[22:25] ordinance. There's new governance
[22:29] because you are being brought into
[22:31] equality with him.
[22:35] You are not in the place of intercession
[22:38] for ignorance anymore.
[22:44] Big difference. Okay, let's bring this
[22:48] to a conclusion.
