[30:04] goodness of God.
[30:06] &gt;&gt; We're not relying on any man's works,
[30:08] but we're relying on the grace of God.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; We're just so thankful for the
[30:12] opportunity to be here for the church
[30:14] and brother Wendle for inviting us to be
[30:16] up here.
[30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:17] &gt;&gt; You have to forgive me. I do get nervous
[30:19] up here when I'm preaching to a bunch of
[30:20] preachers. And you know, we'll just have
[30:23] to do the best we can and you guys can
[30:25] go ahead and preach part two. All right.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; But we're excited to be here. We're
[30:30] closing an old year and we're starting a
[30:32] new year. And
[30:34] &gt;&gt; but you know what?
[30:35] &gt;&gt; We don't have to start over with the
[30:37] Lord.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; You know, we've come through battles,
[30:41] &gt;&gt; but we can keep pressing on.
[30:43] &gt;&gt; We don't have to start over our
[30:45] relationship in 2026 with the Lord,
[30:48] &gt;&gt; but we can continue on the battle.
[30:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; We're just so thankful for that. If you
[30:52] would, let's just dive into the
[30:53] scriptures here. And we'd like to take a
[30:57] a little thought here from Acts chapter
[30:59] 3. We'll take a little scripture here
[31:01] and and maybe a little story from the
[31:04] from David.
[31:06] But if I could, this may be an odd text
[31:09] for this scripture in this time.
[31:12] But this is really what the Lord had put
[31:13] on my heart for this service.
[31:17] &gt;&gt; And if I could title it is, where is the
[31:19] Lord's anointing?
[31:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. Where is the Lord's anointing?
[31:27] &gt;&gt; Acts chapter 3, we'll start with verse
[31:29] one. It says, "Now Peter and John went
[31:30] up together into the temple at the hour
[31:33] of prayer, being the ninth hour, and a
[31:36] certain man lame from his mother's womb
[31:38] was carried whom they laid daily at the
[31:40] gate of the temple which is called
[31:42] beautiful to ask alms of them that
[31:44] entered into the temple, who seeing
[31:47] Peter and John about to go into the
[31:49] temple, asked an alms." And Peter
[31:52] fastening his eyes upon him with John
[31:55] said, "Look on us." And he gave heed
[31:57] unto them, expecting to receive
[31:59] something of them. That's something key
[32:01] there. He was he was expecting to
[32:03] receive something of them.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; And Peter said, "Silver and gold have I
[32:08] none, but such as I have give I thee. In
[32:12] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[32:15] rise up and walk." And he took him by
[32:17] the right hand and lifted him up. And
[32:19] immediately
[32:22] his feet and ankle bones received
[32:24] strength. And he leaping up stood and
[32:26] walked and entered with them into the
[32:28] temple walking and leaping and praising
[32:30] God. And all the people that saw him
[32:32] walking and praising God. Let's just bow
[32:35] our heads.
[32:37] Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[32:39] just come before you yet once more.
[32:40] Father, Lord, we're thankful for this
[32:42] time in this little assembly and
[32:44] believers that have gathered themselves
[32:45] together. Lord, there's many things that
[32:47] we could do tonight, but Father, we just
[32:49] want to set ourselves aside for your
[32:51] service tonight. Father, we just ask
[32:53] that you would just be with each and
[32:54] every one. Lord, we're just asking that
[32:56] you would just take complete control of
[32:57] this service. That you would just work
[32:58] in a supernatural way. Each one of us
[33:01] have needs. Father, you know what they
[33:02] are. We just ask that you would be with
[33:03] them. We ask in Jesus name. Amen.
[33:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated.
[33:09] So again, if I could uh take a a small
[33:11] thought, it's a simple thought here on
[33:14] where is the Lord's anointing. And one
[33:16] thing I love about this message, I I
[33:18] believe this message. I believe that
[33:20] brother Brandham was the uh prophet to
[33:22] our age. And you know, I'm just glad I
[33:24] don't have to come up with any of my own
[33:26] new doctrines. I don't have to come up
[33:28] something to preach on on my own. But I
[33:30] can just reinforce the message of this
[33:32] hour. I can reinforce what God has
[33:35] already sent to the church for this day.
[33:37] And if I repeat what he's saying, and I
[33:40] just bring to you uh uh by remembrance
[33:42] what the Lord has already said, then we
[33:44] ought to be doing all right. But if I
[33:46] could just bring to you what God has
[33:48] already preached to us for our age, then
[33:50] we know that we're going to be on the
[33:52] right track.
[33:53] &gt;&gt; But what we're looking for is we're not
[33:54] looking for an anointing of another day,
[33:56] but what we're looking for is where is
[33:58] God's anointing right now. Come on.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; It's really easy for us to look back in
[34:02] time and to see other maybe uh Bible
[34:06] characters or people from the past and
[34:08] we can see that the Lord had anointed
[34:10] their lives or we could see that God had
[34:13] anointed a certain situation to happen
[34:15] in the past. But sometimes we fail to
[34:17] understand where is God's anointing
[34:19] right now. Yeah,
[34:21] &gt;&gt; we can see how the anointing was on
[34:23] David
[34:24] &gt;&gt; and Goliath
[34:25] &gt;&gt; in that situation and how God anointed
[34:27] David to overcome that situation in that
[34:30] age.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; We can see how the Lord anointed uh uh
[34:33] Moses. We can see how the Lord anointed
[34:36] Christ. We can see how he anointed John
[34:38] the Baptist. We can see how he had
[34:40] anointed uh uh brother Brandham.
[34:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; But can we see the anointing in our
[34:46] lives? Come on, preacher.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; So, that's what I'd like to preach on is
[34:49] where is the Lord's anointing?
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; To anoint means to apply an oil as part
[34:55] of a religious ceremony if you're
[34:56] praying for the sick or whatnot. But it
[34:58] also means to anoint means to choose by
[35:02] divine election.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Now, this is just not a choosing of
[35:07] numbers or a lottery, but this is a
[35:10] choosing
[35:12] &gt;&gt; by divine election. Right.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Well, I think if we could really just
[35:17] focus on that for a minute, that ought
[35:18] to make a Methodist shout. Because
[35:20] before the beginning, God had created
[35:23] you to be one of his.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; You're not one of the devils, but you
[35:27] are one of his. And he has elected you
[35:30] by a divine election, not a happen sense
[35:32] or or something that you just happen to
[35:34] walk into, but this is a divine election
[35:37] that you have been hand selected by the
[35:39] King of Kings, by the Lord of Lords.
[35:41] Amen.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; He already knew your past before the
[35:44] beginning.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; And your future is greater than your
[35:49] past.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; And God has elected you for something.
[35:55] &gt;&gt; Everyone is under
[35:57] &gt;&gt; an anointing.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; We can look back and see what happened
[36:01] even this past year that prophecies had
[36:04] been fulfilled that there would be a
[36:06] pope from the United States. We knew it
[36:08] was coming
[36:10] &gt;&gt; by prophecy. Nobody expected it to
[36:13] happen in 2025, but it happened.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; There is an anointing on the religious
[36:19] realm.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; There's an anointing on the world. Satan
[36:23] has a great anointing on the world in
[36:25] this age to snatch the hearts of young
[36:27] people and old people alike.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; It's not just the young people that
[36:31] struggle,
[36:32] &gt;&gt; but I'm sure the pastors here can can
[36:34] tell you that the old people struggle,
[36:36] too. Right?
[36:38] &gt;&gt; And what usually is a young person's
[36:40] battle has now become old people's
[36:41] battles as well.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Suicidal thoughts and whatever you may,
[36:46] you know, have to battle as a young
[36:48] person, the old people are also battling
[36:50] &gt;&gt; like never before because there's an
[36:52] anointing
[36:54] &gt;&gt; from Satan on this age.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; But if there's an anointing on this age
[36:59] from Satan, then there must be a true
[37:02] anointing.
[37:04] &gt;&gt; That's good. Yes.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Luke says in chapter 21 28, he says,
[37:08] "And when you see these things begin to
[37:10] come to pass, then look up. Lift up your
[37:12] heads for your redemption drawth nigh."
[37:15] &gt;&gt; I think we could take some safety in
[37:17] that this evening
[37:19] &gt;&gt; that when we begin to see all of these
[37:21] things, we begin to see what was
[37:23] preached about in the 40s, in the 50s,
[37:25] in the 60s become come to pass in our
[37:28] age,
[37:30] &gt;&gt; then we ought to be able to walk in
[37:31] &gt;&gt; shity.
[37:32] &gt;&gt; We ought to be able to stand firm. We
[37:35] ought to be able to recognize who we are
[37:38] and where the Lord's anointing is
[37:40] resting in this age.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you a question. Did the
[37:43] ANOINTING OF THE HOLY Spirit die with
[37:45] brother Brandon?
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Is it buried somewhere in Indiana,
[37:49] Kentucky, or somewhere over in Arizona?
[37:51] No. The Lord's anointing has continued
[37:53] on. The Lord's anointing is the Holy
[37:56] Spirit, and it's not buried somewhere in
[37:58] the ground 6 feet deep. But this Lord's
[38:00] anointing is on his people tonight. And
[38:03] it has anointed us to overcome.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; The Lord's anointing has never anointed
[38:08] one believer to defeat.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; But the Lord's anointing is an anointing
[38:13] to overcome.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham tells a story of the
[38:22] young eaglet. They get snatched out of
[38:25] the eagle's nest.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:28] &gt;&gt; It was an egg. They put it in the in the
[38:31] chicken's nest. You remember the story,
[38:34] right?
[38:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:35] &gt;&gt; It gets hatched in the wrong location.
[38:37] The environment was right.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Great.
[38:39] &gt;&gt; And so it hatched.
[38:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:41] &gt;&gt; But as it began to grow, it just kept
[38:44] looking around and
[38:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; kept going, something has an uncertain
[38:49] sound.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; I hear this cluck cluck cluck. This a
[38:53] days of miracles has passed.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Well, the anointing was just for brother
[38:57] Brando.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; Something just didn't sit right with
[39:02] that little
[39:02] &gt;&gt; leaf.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; You know, all the all the chickens were
[39:05] fine.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; They liked that kind of food.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; They like scratching around in the dirt
[39:10] and pecking here and pecking there and
[39:11] eating a little worm here and a little
[39:13] worm there. But there was something more
[39:15] for an eagle.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; There was something inside of that eagle
[39:18] that was calling for a little bit more.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; It wasn't an earthbound bird.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; But it was a heavenly bird.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; That's right. If you've got something in
[39:29] your heart, a deep that's calling out to
[39:30] the deep, then that means that there
[39:32] must be a deep to respond.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; So if you want to have more of God in
[39:37] your life, Brother Brandham said, then
[39:39] there must be more of God to have in
[39:41] your life.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; If there's a desire in you to overcome
[39:45] tonight, then there must be an
[39:47] overcoming for you to have.
[39:49] &gt;&gt; And that overcoming is found in the
[39:50] anointing of the Holy Spirit, and the
[39:52] Holy Spirit is for you. Oh, I know how
[39:55] the devil likes to come and he likes to
[39:56] say, "Oh, the Holy Spirit may be for the
[39:58] pastor. The Holy Spirit may be for the
[39:59] preacher. The Holy Spirit may be for the
[40:01] song leader. It may be FOR THE
[40:02] MUSICIANS, BUT IT AIN'T FOR YOU.
[40:05] &gt;&gt; I'm too young or I'm too old or I've got
[40:07] a pastor. I've done this or I've done
[40:09] that or I've got time.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; This anointing is for you tonight. We
[40:14] don't have to wait for the new year. We
[40:16] don't have to wait for it to hit 1200.
[40:19] But we can take our position right now.
[40:22] Submit to the anointing of the Holy
[40:24] Spirit. Reach out and grab your promise
[40:26] tonight.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; It's not an emotional workup.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to preach to you some
[40:32] motivational uh uh uh speech.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to preach to you a message
[40:37] that is motivational.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to preach to you the
[40:40] scriptures THAT ARE BEING FULFILLED
[40:42] BEFORE OUR VERY EYES to where we can see
[40:45] where we're standing. THAT PROPHECY IS
[40:47] BEING FULFILLED. WE'RE FOLLOWING
[40:49] something that's true. And the truth
[40:50] shall set you free.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; Shall set you free.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; We've all gone through struggles this
[41:02] year. Can we all say amen to that?
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; But the truth shall set you free.
[41:09] You know, so many times I see in in
[41:11] message churches how sometimes we bind
[41:13] ourselves up in our mind
[41:17] &gt;&gt; and we allow Satan to have his way in
[41:19] our lives because we've bound ourselves
[41:21] in our mind.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; Where we don't feel free. We still show
[41:26] up. We still sit in a pew,
[41:27] &gt;&gt; but we're not free like we should be.
[41:30] &gt;&gt; But this truth shall set you free.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Preach it. Amen.
[41:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says says, "I tell you,
[41:39] just like that little eagle recognize
[41:41] that voice,
[41:42] &gt;&gt; so does a real born again Christian
[41:44] recognize the voice of God speaking
[41:46] through the word.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; When they see it anointed
[41:51] &gt;&gt; and vindicated
[41:53] &gt;&gt; when they see it anointed
[41:56] and vindicated,
[41:57] &gt;&gt; that's it."
[41:59] &gt;&gt; He looked up there. He didn't see this
[42:02] old hand cluck. Cluck around here. join
[42:05] us and go over there, do this, do that,
[42:08] go uh to do this and that. He saw being
[42:11] like he wanted to be sailing in the air,
[42:14] screaming free up in the heights,
[42:18] &gt;&gt; above all the vultures and things of the
[42:20] earth. Hallelujah. He wanted to be like
[42:22] that because that's what he was.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; You see the difference between an eagle
[42:27] and a vultures?
[42:30] They're very two different birds.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Sure.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; The vultures will come down, they'll eat
[42:34] some dead
[42:36] &gt;&gt; deer on the side of the road.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:38] &gt;&gt; But you know, when they want to have a
[42:39] heavenly experience, they got to flap
[42:41] their wings.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; And they got to flap. And they got to
[42:44] flap. And they got to flap and flap and
[42:45] flap and flap. And they got to get up
[42:47] into the air by some some emotional
[42:49] workup.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; They got to get themselves a heavenly
[42:53] experience by something that they can
[42:54] work up.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; But the difference between a vulture and
[42:57] an eagle is the eagle sitting over in
[42:59] that pine tree, Brother Brandham said.
[43:01] He kept listening to that little
[43:02] squirrel go chatter chatter chatter
[43:03] chatter chatter chatter. And one day he
[43:05] got sick of it.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; One of these days we got to get sick of
[43:08] listening to the devil in our lives
[43:11] saying that you're not good enough
[43:13] &gt;&gt; or your complex is going to keep you
[43:15] down.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; There are way too many message believers
[43:19] living in complex.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; We have been called to something larger
[43:26] than that.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; WE'VE BEEN CALLED TO SOMETHING BIGGER
[43:29] than that. WE HAVE BEEN CALLED TO
[43:31] overcome your complex in your life.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; But I'm not good enough. No, you are
[43:36] not.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; But I know one that is.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; And we're not relying on our experience.
[43:42] We're relying on Jesus Christ and his
[43:44] word. And so he has overcome.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; That's good preaching.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Trying not to get ahead of myself.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Good preaching. He says, "And a man that
[43:55] is born of God, a son of God, has to
[43:58] have the nature of God."
[44:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Boy, we could preach a sermon on that.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; He has to be like God.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; He honors God. He's a part of the word
[44:12] of God.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; Well, that's heavy.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; That's good. And in this last days of
[44:19] this bride taking form, just exactly the
[44:23] same power that he was in the beginning
[44:26] has come up through these organizations
[44:29] and so forth and come out for a bride.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; So the same thing that Christ did back
[44:37] then,
[44:38] &gt;&gt; the bride is going to do now.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; So now we're looking at Acts three.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Here comes
[44:46] the disciples to church
[44:49] &gt;&gt; and they see a man that is lame from
[44:52] birth
[44:54] &gt;&gt; and he comes expecting to receive
[44:56] something from them.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; How many times we come to church and you
[45:00] know it just becomes a tradition to us.
[45:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said in in in in the
[45:05] unveiling of Christ he said we have been
[45:08] veiled by traditions.
[45:11] Okay.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; So many of these churches, Methodists or
[45:14] Baptist, Pentecostal, Lutheran, whatever
[45:17] it may be, they've been veiled by
[45:19] traditions and it has blinded them to
[45:21] seeing the freedom in the word.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; So, we have to be careful now
[45:28] &gt;&gt; as message believers not to get caught
[45:30] up into tradition that we just come to
[45:33] church on Sunday because that's what we
[45:34] do. We just show up and we sit at the
[45:36] same place every day. We put a dollar in
[45:38] the plate when it comes around. Yeah,
[45:40] &gt;&gt; we listen to the preacher for about an
[45:41] hour. If he preaches a little bit more,
[45:43] then we get upset. You know, we got to
[45:45] get in the church. WE'RE GETTING BOUND
[45:47] UP BY TRADITION.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think we need to break up a
[45:51] little tradition.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I think we need to do a little
[45:53] bit different.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES I THINK IT WOULDN'T hurt if we
[45:56] raised our hand. Sometimes I don't think
[45:58] it WOULD HURT IF WE RAISED OUR OTHER
[46:00] HAND. Sometimes I don't think that it
[46:02] would hurt if we marched around the
[46:04] church a little bit.
[46:05] I'm not talking about uh on something
[46:09] run out of the uh
[46:11] &gt;&gt; church order.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; We have church order.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; But sometimes you got to get a little
[46:16] Pentecostal experience
[46:18] &gt;&gt; so you can experience some of that
[46:19] freedom.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:24] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be bound down by
[46:25] traditions.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:26] &gt;&gt; That's not what you've been called to
[46:27] do.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:30] in the anointed ones of the end time.
[46:32] Brother Brandham says,
[46:36] "Now you called them vultures." You say,
[46:38] "Brother Brandon, that's right. But
[46:40] remember, a vulture is just a bird.
[46:43] He's anointed to fly also.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; These two spirits will be so close it'll
[46:48] deceive the elected. A vulture is a big
[46:51] as an eagle. He can fly like that eagle.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; He's anointed to fly or to preach or to
[46:58] prophesy." Notice the same as an eagle.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; It might be hard to tell the difference
[47:04] of them sitting in a church building.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; But he can't follow the eagle in the
[47:13] heights.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; No. No. If he tries to follow that
[47:19] eagle, his follyies will be made
[47:21] manifest.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; He doesn't have the personal revelation.
[47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's it. How many times have we
[47:29] seen message preachers?
[47:33] &gt;&gt; Vultures.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; If brother Brandham called them
[47:36] vultures, I'm going to call them
[47:37] vultures.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; If they don't have the PERSONAL
[47:39] REVELATION OF JESUS Christ and how he
[47:41] has been manifested in this age,
[47:44] &gt;&gt; the word of God living in this age, then
[47:47] they are vultures. They can't follow us
[47:49] to the heights. So the scripture says,
[47:50] don't be surprised when they go out of
[47:52] from us because they were never of us.
[47:55] Yeah. Yeah.
[47:56] &gt;&gt; But here they are. PASTORS AND PREACHERS
[47:59] IN MESSAGE CHURCHES, VULTURES.
[48:03] &gt;&gt; I know that's hard. This is brother
[48:04] Windle's church, but you can clean up
[48:06] the mess later. WE DON'T WANT TO BE
[48:07] VULTURES.
[48:09] &gt;&gt; WE want to be eagles.
[48:11] &gt;&gt; We want to follow Christ into the
[48:13] heights.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; And you know what that little eagle did?
[48:16] It was sitting up there in that tree.
[48:17] And it didn't have to get a Pentecostal
[48:19] workup to soar into the heights.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But it knew that the power
[48:24] &gt;&gt; that made him rise
[48:26] &gt;&gt; is already
[48:28] &gt;&gt; in the skies.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; It's nothing that you can do.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; It's not how good I can live. If it was
[48:33] up to me on how good I could live, if I
[48:35] would go into rapture or not, brother,
[48:36] I'm sorry to admit I wouldn't make it.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; And neither would you. And neither would
[48:42] anybody else. But we're relying
[48:44] &gt;&gt; on the anointing of the Holy Spirit in
[48:46] our age.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Yes.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:53] &gt;&gt; So sometimes we just need to set our
[48:55] wings
[48:57] &gt;&gt; to the winds of faith.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; And just reach higher and higher
[49:02] &gt;&gt; and higher
[49:04] &gt;&gt; and higher.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[49:06] &gt;&gt; Because if if there's more of God
[49:08] desiring in your heart, then there's got
[49:10] to be more of God to to respond. Yeah.
[49:15] &gt;&gt; If you're in your heart, you need
[49:16] healing
[49:17] &gt;&gt; and you want healing.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said if there's a deep
[49:20] calling, there's got to be a deep to
[49:21] respond.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; That is thus sayeth the Lord for our
[49:24] age.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; That settles it.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; And I'm just hillbilly enough to believe
[49:29] it.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; That if God said it, he vindicated it
[49:33] through a prophet, then I'll believe it.
[49:35] It'll happen.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; It's not my words.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; It's God's words.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; The creator of heavens and earth is so
[49:49] interested in you.
[49:51] He sent a prophet down.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Well, why did he have to uh come down
[49:55] and tell me through a prophet? Why
[49:56] couldn't he tell him me himself? I've
[49:59] thought the same thing.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Well, without the message, we might not
[50:01] understand it.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said he he tried to
[50:05] speak to the people one time
[50:07] &gt;&gt; and the people got scared and said, "No,
[50:09] no, speak through Moses."
[50:12] So God told him, "From now on, I'm going
[50:14] to speak through the prophets."
[50:16] &gt;&gt; That's what he said.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; That's why we needed brother
[50:18] &gt;&gt; brain.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Because that is God explaining through a
[50:22] prophet.
[50:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; I know this is simple tonight. I'm not
[50:27] I'm not looking to preach any new
[50:28] doctrines tonight, but what I'm trying
[50:30] to get you to realize is God's anointing
[50:32] is in his word.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; God's anointing. We need to eat the
[50:37] book.
[50:39] And if you are what you eat and you eat
[50:40] the word and you are the word, then your
[50:42] anointing
[50:44] &gt;&gt; is the Holy Ghost living inside of you,
[50:47] then when you say let it be so, then
[50:49] it's just like Jesus Christ saying, "Let
[50:51] it be so." Because we are praying in the
[50:53] name of Jesus Christ.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; You know how an ambassador works.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; They go to a foreign country and they
[51:00] have the entire power of the United
[51:02] States or whatever country it is that
[51:04] they're representing behind them. Yeah.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; And when they say in the name of the
[51:08] United States, it doesn't matter their
[51:10] past.
[51:12] &gt;&gt; But all the power OF THE UNITED STATES
[51:14] IS BEHIND THEM
[51:16] &gt;&gt; to back up what they say, brother.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter my past. LOOK, KOBE,
[51:21] IT DOESN'T MATTER YOUR PAST. BUT
[51:23] WHATEVER YOU SAY IN the name of Jesus
[51:26] Christ,
[51:27] &gt;&gt; there's no other name,
[51:29] &gt;&gt; but in the name of Jesus Christ, let it
[51:31] be so.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; It's done. It's finished. YOU DON'T HAVE
[51:35] TO WORK IT UP. You don't have to pray it
[51:37] up.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, let it be
[51:39] so and it shall be done.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; That's thus sayeth the Lord for our age.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Came through a vindicated prophet
[51:47] &gt;&gt; just like the Bible said it would be
[51:51] [Music]
[51:55] &gt;&gt; but people can't follow us up there.
[51:58] Right.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; I've got lots of friends that I grew up
[52:03] with in a message church out in the
[52:04] world.
[52:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:06] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; They couldn't catch it.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; They couldn't catch it.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; But what's interesting is Brother
[52:14] Brandham's preaching this and after
[52:16] church, one brother says, "Oh, I can't
[52:17] believe he called us vultures."
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Right?
[52:22] &gt;&gt; But the other brother said, "What? You,
[52:24] brother, didn't call us vultures."
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He called us eagles.
[52:29] &gt;&gt; There was an anointing on each of those
[52:31] brothers.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A GOOD anointing on one
[52:34] brother and there was a bad anointing on
[52:36] the other. There was a vulture anointing
[52:38] on one and there was an eagle anointing
[52:40] on the other one.
[52:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; It's harvest time.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; It is. Come on.
[52:51] &gt;&gt; Who you are will be made manifest. We're
[52:53] getting too close to the end. That's why
[52:55] we're seeing people fall away left and
[52:57] right.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; You're either going to be a wheat or
[53:01] you're going to be a weed,
[53:03] &gt;&gt; but you will be exposed.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[53:06] &gt;&gt; You know, I was listening to and I guess
[53:09] I'll just uh I'll just preach on this. I
[53:12] was listening to the mighty God
[53:13] unveiled.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; And he's talking about how God in this
[53:16] last age has been unveiled to the
[53:18] believer.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; What a powerful message. I mean, I think
[53:23] I think we would we could go listen to
[53:24] that message every day and get something
[53:26] new.
[53:27] &gt;&gt; The mighty God unveiled to his
[53:29] believers.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; He's not unveiled to everybody.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; But he's unveiled to the believers.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; That's why the curtain had to be rent at
[53:36] Calvary.
[53:36] &gt;&gt; That's exactly.
[53:37] &gt;&gt; That's why Moses had to wear a veil.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Right. Come on.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; There's so many types, brother, that we
[53:41] could take from here. But what the what
[53:43] what the point is is God has unveiled
[53:46] himself for the believer. If you see
[53:48] this message, consider yourself blessed.
[53:52] CONSIDER YOURSELF A BLESSED PEOPLE THAT
[53:54] THIS PROMISE IS FOR YOU. SO THAT ALONE
[53:56] should give you the faith enough to
[53:58] reach out and grab your promise tonight
[54:00] &gt;&gt; because you can see this
[54:02] &gt;&gt; promise.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; And it's for you.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; It's not for the person sitting next to
[54:08] you.
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Everybody say me.
[54:12] &gt;&gt; This is for me.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; It's for me, too. Praise the Lord.
[54:18] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. If I
[54:21] could tell you a little story about
[54:23] little Bible character I'm sure you've
[54:24] heard of is David.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; We look back and see how he was
[54:29] anointed, right?
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; He was an anointed young man. And boy,
[54:35] he uh he could play the harp. I'm sure
[54:37] he was like brother Kobe. He could play
[54:38] the piano, play the organ, play the
[54:41] &gt;&gt; what you name it, he could play it.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; He had an anointing on him. Yeah.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; He had an anointing on him that was so
[54:49] great
[54:52] it could disperse the anointing of fear.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Because Saul was anointed king.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; He was an anointed man for the job.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; But then he got away from the word
[55:09] thinking he could do better.
[55:11] And so the prophet came to him and he
[55:13] said, "God's repented of making you king
[55:17] &gt;&gt; because you didn't stay with the word."
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[55:21] &gt;&gt; We got to stick with the word. We got to
[55:22] stick with the message.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; We got to stick with the prophet.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; But he thought he knew better. So he
[55:30] kept uh what was it? The Amalachites.
[55:32] He kept the king and some of the best
[55:34] cattle and the sheep and he was going to
[55:36] have a sacrifice. The prophet came to
[55:38] him and he said, "Obedience is better
[55:41] than sacrifice."
[55:44] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we need to hear that as a
[55:45] churches. Obedience is better than
[55:47] sacrifice. Brother Wendle, if they're
[55:48] listening to your your uh your uh uh
[55:52] consultations, sometimes they need to
[55:54] know obedience is better than sacrifice.
[55:57] You know,
[55:58] &gt;&gt; but I tithe to the church and I do this
[56:01] and I do that. Obedience is better than
[56:03] sacrifice.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Now, that one was free.
[56:09] Yeah.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; So then the Lord says, "I'm going to
[56:11] find one that's made after my own
[56:12] heart."
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; And he anoints David.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to not notice that when
[56:19] David was anointed king,
[56:22] &gt;&gt; he all of his trials didn't just go
[56:24] away.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; No.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; But David is now anointed king and then
[56:29] a a lion comes up against his herd.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Okay? He's anointed king and then a bear
[56:36] comes up against his herd. He goes
[56:37] through struggles. He goes through
[56:39] dangerous situations.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we read through scriptures and
[56:43] we go, David, you know, overcame a lion
[56:45] and a bear through, you know, the power
[56:46] of the Holy Spirit and we just keep
[56:49] moving on.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; No, literally a lion and a bear.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; And a slingshot.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; And a little ruddy. I'm five.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Whatever. I am 10. He was 53. I think
[57:01] brother Bram said 56. Somewhere in there
[57:04] about this high.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Going up against a bear.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; And a lion
[57:08] &gt;&gt; with a little slingshot.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Real battles. I'm talking.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Dangerous situations.
[57:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; What situation do you have?
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; All right.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; But David had to go through these things
[57:23] for a very specific reason.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. It was to give him experience
[57:30] &gt;&gt; that he could trust the Lord in all
[57:31] situations
[57:33] &gt;&gt; because those battles were preparing him
[57:35] for something.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; The things he was going through back
[57:39] then was preparing him for a battle when
[57:42] he faced Goliath.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[57:44] &gt;&gt; maybe you're facing a Goliath now.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[57:46] &gt;&gt; maybe you've been through financial
[57:48] troubles or what whatever the case may
[57:50] be in your life. Maybe you're facing a
[57:52] Goliath, but you can look back at all
[57:54] the struggles that you've had to go
[57:55] through and you can say, "The Lord was
[57:57] preparing me for tonight.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; The Lord was preparing me throughout all
[58:03] the years of my life to be able to stand
[58:05] here in church tonight on a watch night
[58:08] service and say, "Devil, I've had
[58:10] enough.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; You've came out and you've boasted one
[58:13] too many times. You've come out day
[58:16] after day after day and said, "I am not
[58:18] good enough." But that boast finally
[58:20] fell, brother Bram said, on the wrong
[58:22] ears
[58:25] &gt;&gt; because he was preaching it to Saul that
[58:27] had been anointed at one time.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; But when that boast fell on true
[58:33] &gt;&gt; anointed ears,
[58:36] &gt;&gt; where the Holy Spirit was working.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a real anointing. I'm
[58:43] talking about a real experience.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about an emotional
[58:46] Pentecostal workup.
[58:48] I'm not talking about just screaming and
[58:49] shouting, but I'm talking about the
[58:51] stimulation of revelation. When it
[58:53] strikes your heart, it makes you dance a
[58:55] little bit.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; It makes you firm.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; It makes you know where you stand.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; That it doesn't matter if mama and daddy
[59:04] go astray. It doesn't matter if the
[59:05] pastor goes astray. It doesn't matter if
[59:07] the deacons go astray. You know where
[59:09] you stand because you've had an
[59:10] experience.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; You've got an anointing on your life
[59:15] that is a higher calling.
[59:18] Hallelujah.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Now, the Israelites were not a,
[59:23] how would I want to say this? They
[59:25] weren't cowardice.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; They were where they were supposed to
[59:29] be,
[59:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; There was a battle called and the
[59:33] children of Israel dressed themselves
[59:34] up.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; They had their armor on. They were at
[59:39] the field of battle.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; They were camped there.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and the the the enemy is right
[59:45] across the valley.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; They were where they were supposed to be
[59:49] scripturally.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; But then the devil would come out and
[59:54] say,
[59:56] "I'm bigger than you."
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; One of you come out and face me.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have church struggles like
[1:00:05] that.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; Where the church is where it's supposed
[1:00:07] to be. All right.
[1:00:09] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here in your suit and tie
[1:00:11] or the women's got their long dresses
[1:00:13] on.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; And you're sitting there and the the
[1:00:15] devil's coming up and saying,
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; "I'm bigger than you."
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; And day after day after day, we listen
[1:00:25] to the boast of the enemy when he says,
[1:00:27] "I'm bigger than you. You'll never
[1:00:29] overcome pornography. You'll never
[1:00:30] overcome lustful. You'll never overcome
[1:00:32] this or that or whatever the case may
[1:00:34] be." and you listen to him day after day
[1:00:38] after day. But when those those false
[1:00:40] boasts come on anointed ears,
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; then there is something that is
[1:00:48] different.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; There's got to be somebody that rises up
[1:00:51] and say, "What?"
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; What is this uncircumcised Philistine
[1:00:56] saying to the army of the Lord?
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:01] But you see the thing that was happening
[1:01:03] with the Israelites is they were sitting
[1:01:04] there waiting for a champion.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; They sat there waiting and waiting and
[1:01:11] waiting, waiting for the champion to
[1:01:13] arise.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Well, maybe it's the pastor's job. Well,
[1:01:18] maybe it's the deacon's job. Well, maybe
[1:01:20] it's the song leader's job. A champion
[1:01:22] must arise.
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:25] &gt;&gt; But one that was anointed for the job.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, bless the Lord. Bless the Lord.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling a little religious.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; One that was anointed for the job
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; TOOK RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE JOB.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Cuz you see, with anointing comes
[1:01:41] responsibility.
[1:01:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; So many times we want the anointing of
[1:01:46] Jesus Christ and none of the
[1:01:47] responsibility that comes with it.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; We want to be prayer warriors, but we
[1:01:51] don't want anything to to happen in our
[1:01:53] life where we need to pray.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:01:56] We want to be the one that everybody
[1:01:57] comes to and consults with us, but we
[1:01:58] don't want the life experience.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; If I could put it this way, we want to
[1:02:02] go into the promised land, but we're
[1:02:04] afraid of the beast stinging us and and
[1:02:06] the cow kicking us.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; We want to be in the land of flowing
[1:02:09] with milk and honey, but we don't want
[1:02:10] to go through the trials.
[1:02:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; I can tell you one thing. I don't think
[1:02:16] that David thought that he was anointed
[1:02:18] to be king when he came up against the
[1:02:20] bear. When he came up against the line,
[1:02:22] we he came up against Goliath.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; He probably wasn't feeling a
[1:02:26] Pentecostal, woo, I'm anointed for this
[1:02:28] job,
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; but it was a trial that he had to go
[1:02:31] through and he was anointed for the job.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; I don't think that our Lord and and
[1:02:36] Savior Jesus Christ was feeling
[1:02:37] anointed, but he was carrying the cross
[1:02:39] up Calvary.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; He probably wasn't feeling it.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; but he was anointed for the job
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; because someone had to take
[1:02:50] responsibility.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; He had an anointing on his life and he
[1:02:54] had to take responsibility.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Maybe there's an anointing on your life
[1:02:59] to be a father, a good, godly father.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; There's a responsibility to be taken.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Maybe you're the oldest in the family.
[1:03:06] There's a responsibility that comes with
[1:03:08] that. There's an anointing on your life
[1:03:10] by the Holy Spirit and you have to take
[1:03:12] responsibility for what that anointing
[1:03:14] is.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; I know this is odd for a year end
[1:03:17] service, but this is just what the Lord
[1:03:18] put on my heart.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; But the sword of the Lord will prevail.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:03:36] 1st Samuel 17 and 47
[1:03:42] David yells out and says, "And all this
[1:03:44] assembly shall know that the Lord saveth
[1:03:47] not with a sword or spear,
[1:03:50] for the battle is the Lord's, and he
[1:03:52] will give you into my hands."
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; That was the key of the battle right
[1:03:57] there.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:00] David didn't say, "I've got all this
[1:04:02] experience, so I can overcome you."
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; What did he say?
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; He said, "The battle is the Lord's."
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; And I will take you into my hands.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; He said, "And he will give you into our
[1:04:21] hands."
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; So if this is not any longer David's
[1:04:25] battle
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; and now this is the Lord's battle, Come
[1:04:29] on.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Then boy, you can be a whole lot more
[1:04:32] confident
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; because now this is no longer David
[1:04:35] versus Goliath, but now this is the LORD
[1:04:38] VERSUS SOME UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; I think we need to change our perception
[1:04:43] sometimes of how we look at the devil.
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; And we need to quit looking at him like
[1:04:47] this big great Goliath of a guy
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; that can just have his way in any way he
[1:04:53] wants to treat us. We just have to cower
[1:04:54] down and say, "Oh, the devil's been hard
[1:04:56] to me this week. Oh, the devil told me
[1:04:58] this and the devil told me that and this
[1:05:00] is happening to my family and I can't
[1:05:01] control nothing and
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; but we need to view this as this is our
[1:05:06] God versus some insignificant. You know
[1:05:10] how big Goliath is when you look at a
[1:05:12] globe?
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; I can't even see Goliath when I look at
[1:05:14] a globe.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; that's how big your problem is in the
[1:05:17] eyes of God.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; They're insignificant.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; So, this isn't your battle,
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; but this is the Lord's battle. And guess
[1:05:26] what? He doesn't want to work his own
[1:05:28] hands. He wants to work through your
[1:05:30] hands.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; He wants to work through your voice
[1:05:34] because you have been anointed for the
[1:05:36] job.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; He has selected you through a divine
[1:05:42] selection for that particular job.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Lord Parker, I couldn't face your
[1:05:48] battles.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; You have to face your battle. He has
[1:05:51] anointed you to do your job. Yeah.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; He's anointed me to do my job.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; We can't be jealous of each other's
[1:06:01] gifts. We can't be jealous of people's
[1:06:03] offices. WE HAVE TO DO OUR JOB.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; We're working as a team.
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; So, David had a revelation. The battle
[1:06:14] is the Lord's and he is just using our
[1:06:17] vessel to work through.
[1:06:20] That's how David could be fearless.
[1:06:23] Yeah.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Then we skip down to verse 50.
[1:06:27] And you know what?
[1:06:29] The same uh vessel
[1:06:32] that the devil thought he would use to
[1:06:33] overcome you.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Was the same vessel
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; that David overcame by.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; The very sword that Goliath came out day
[1:06:44] after day after day saying, "I will slay
[1:06:46] you with this sword.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; I will slay you with this sword and
[1:06:52] you'll all be my slaves. That same sword
[1:06:55] is the sword that cut off Goliath's
[1:06:57] head.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; David put revelation into action and
[1:07:01] overcame him and then chopped off his
[1:07:03] head with the very thing
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; that he said he was going to overcome
[1:07:06] him with.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Your testimony
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; can cut the devil's head off.
[1:07:16] You could be the skin on the bottom of
[1:07:17] the feet of the Lord Jesus body.
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; But you know, the hand is not ordained
[1:07:24] to stomp on the devil.
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; Right, brother?
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; The job of the skin on the bottom of the
[1:07:30] feet.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Is to stomp
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; on the head
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; of the devil.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; And sometimes I feel like that where I'm
[1:07:38] just the lowest Christian. I don't
[1:07:39] deserve anything. And sometimes I wonder
[1:07:41] if I'm even Christian or not.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know what? If I'm
[1:07:45] the skin on the bottom of my feet,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; then my job is to rise up and quit, as
[1:07:51] brother Forny would say, of the wowsy
[1:07:53] wowsy woos.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; To shake all that off,
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; to shake it off and stomp on the head of
[1:07:58] the devil.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Because somebody has to start taking
[1:08:02] responsibility and stand up and say,
[1:08:04] "I'll do it."
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; If somebody needs prayer, I'll do it.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; If something needs to happen in the
[1:08:10] church, I'll do it. Come on.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; If somebody needs to study a little bit
[1:08:14] more, I'll do it.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to start taking
[1:08:19] responsibility.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; Because as soon as David overcame,
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; All those Israelites were ready.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; They were ready to follow their
[1:08:29] champion.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; What did brother Brandham say? He said
[1:08:31] in in why little Bethlehem, he says, "We
[1:08:34] didn't conquer." He said, "It's already
[1:08:37] conquered."
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; We never conquered death. Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; He conquered death for us.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; He is our David in this day.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; Listen, you don't have to go fight
[1:08:52] Goliath.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ already fought Goliath.
[1:08:55] We've got to vindicate the prophet's
[1:08:56] word for this.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; He already fought Goliath for our day.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; Have at it cancer.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Have at it sickness.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Have at it financial problems. My God is
[1:09:08] greater.
[1:09:10] Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; My God is greater than any problem that
[1:09:13] you could face.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; And I've got confidence in him.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; First John 2:20 says, "But you have an
[1:09:24] anointing from the Holy One."
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; 1 John 2:27 says, "But the anointing
[1:09:29] which you have received of him abideth
[1:09:32] in you."
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's scripture.
[1:09:38] So what I'm preaching to you tonight is
[1:09:40] not my own idea.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; This is God's word for us in this age.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; John 9:6
[1:09:55] says, "When he had spoken this, he spat
[1:09:56] on the ground and made clay of the
[1:09:59] spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the
[1:10:01] blind man with the clay."
[1:10:04] So when the anointing reached his eyes,
[1:10:07] he could see.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; That's the type of anointing that we're
[1:10:11] looking for in this age.
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; We're not looking for some other
[1:10:16] anointing, but we're looking for the
[1:10:17] Holy Ghost anointing,
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; to anoint our eyes that we might be able
[1:10:21] to see.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Do we understand everything brother
[1:10:23] Brandon preached?
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we don't.
[1:10:28] But if you keep resting in that
[1:10:30] anointing,
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; he'll show you.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; He'll show you.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; Mark 16:15 says,
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; "And he said unto them, go you into all
[1:10:39] the world and preach the gospel unto
[1:10:41] every creature."
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; That's the anointing that we have.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:10:46] &gt;&gt; You know, I think message churches ought
[1:10:47] to be a whole lot bigger.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; We know there's going to be three kinds
[1:10:51] of believers in every congregation.
[1:10:52] Brother Brandham told us that.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But you know,
[1:10:56] as I'm going to preach it myself,
[1:10:59] I don't do enough outreach.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; I think as message believers, we get an
[1:11:04] elitist mentality sometimes
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; and we look down on everybody else and
[1:11:08] we're not sharing the gospel like we
[1:11:10] should.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; We're not sharing the message like WE
[1:11:13] SHOULD.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; THE SEVEN seals are open. Hello.
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; Do we know what that means? Yeah,
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; we could share this with the rest of the
[1:11:23] CHURCH WORLD
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; AND A BUNCH OF THEM ALL REJECTED. THAT'S
[1:11:26] OKAY. WE'LL KEEP sharing it anyway
[1:11:28] because I have been ANOINTED BY MARK 16
[1:11:31] TO GO into all the world and preach the
[1:11:33] gospel. What is the gospel? The message
[1:11:36] OF THIS AGE, NOT SOME message gone by,
[1:11:38] but in message for this age.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; Seven seals have been revealed.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; The seventh CHURCH'S MESSENGER HAS
[1:11:47] ALREADY BEEN HERE.
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; YEAH. We're just waiting for a rapture.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Boy, we're close.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Boy, we're close.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Or are we not
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Let's continue on just a little bit
[1:12:03] here. I won't hold you too too long.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:12:16] Brother Ram says in why Christ speak he
[1:12:17] says you know the bishop maybe told him
[1:12:19] now look here son that man's a
[1:12:21] theologian see he's a fighter
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; he was born a fighter he's been a
[1:12:26] fighter from his youth and you're no
[1:12:29] match for him
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; and his brother said oh you naughty
[1:12:33] little thing come out here to do such a
[1:12:34] thing as go on get back home
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; brother Brham said that didn't bother
[1:12:39] him
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; why he knew he was anointed
[1:12:45] The God that delivered me from the lion.
[1:12:47] The God that delivered me from the paws
[1:12:49] of that bear.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; He'll more than do that.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; He'll deliver me from this Philistine.
[1:12:54] Here I come. I meet you in the name of
[1:12:57] the Lord God of Israel.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't pray through. He was
[1:13:02] already prayed through.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; We'll leave that for another sermon.
[1:13:11] God prayed him through before the
[1:13:13] foundation of the world.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; He was anointed for the job.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; He had to speak and go forward.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; He had to speak and go forward. You
[1:13:31] know, Samson was anointed for a job.
[1:13:33] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; He had to do his job.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Yes. So now we see Peter and John here
[1:13:38] in Acts three and they're just walking
[1:13:40] on an everyday uh walk going to church
[1:13:43] just like they did every day
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; and there was a man sitting there asking
[1:13:48] for money going I have a need of
[1:13:50] something and you they stopped by
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; and so he expected to get some money but
[1:13:54] what he got was something greater.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; And I want you to notice what the what
[1:13:59] the uh apostles said. They said silver
[1:14:02] and gold have I none but that which I
[1:14:04] have. Amen.
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; What did they have?
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; They had an anointing on their life.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Mark 16 said, "Go into all the world
[1:14:13] preaching the gospel."
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; They'll lay hands on the sick and they
[1:14:16] shall recover.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; These are Bible's principles that were
[1:14:21] taught to the disciples and they just
[1:14:22] went about every day believing it.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; And it went about every day coming to
[1:14:27] pass just like they believed it because
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; it's scripture.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; It's what God has told us. And he
[1:14:33] vindicated it through a prophet so we
[1:14:35] can believe that it is true.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; That's right. Come on.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Wish I was a good preacher right now.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; If we could grab on to the promises that
[1:14:47] God has set before us through this
[1:14:49] message. It's been vindicated over and
[1:14:52] over and over and over and over and
[1:14:53] over.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; And over and over and over and over. If
[1:14:55] we could grab on to those.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Put yourself in the in the in the
[1:15:00] position of David right now. Come on.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; You've got past experiences. God has
[1:15:04] brought you through a whole lot of
[1:15:05] stuff.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; We've all got stuff
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; and he has brought you through it. How
[1:15:10] do I know? Cuz you're sitting here.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; And now we're looking at a battle with
[1:15:14] the devil and we're saying, "Who's
[1:15:15] anointed to take this devil down? I
[1:15:18] can't take down your Goliath. You have
[1:15:20] to take down your Goliath. And you are
[1:15:23] not alone. You have Jesus Christ on your
[1:15:26] side.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; He's promised it to be so. It's written
[1:15:29] in the scriptures. It's been vindicated
[1:15:31] by the prophet. And so now your only job
[1:15:34] is to believe it and send that
[1:15:36] revelation into action.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; I believe there's believers here tonight
[1:15:40] that have sickness or whatever your your
[1:15:42] need is. You can raise your hand tonight
[1:15:44] and you can accept it tonight.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; This isn't an emotional workup. This is
[1:15:48] the promise of God. And I am willing to
[1:15:50] accept it tonight. Not some other
[1:15:52] preacher when he comes. Not some special
[1:15:54] meetings, not some not next YEAR, BUT
[1:15:57] RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW,
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; I'm saying right now.
[1:16:00] &gt;&gt; We can accept what the Lord has given to
[1:16:02] us. And we can accept it right now.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; We don't have to wait for a prayer line.
[1:16:06] We don't have to wait for communion. But
[1:16:07] right now,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; sir,
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; because we are more than conquerors.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; You know the story of Muhammad Ali. He
[1:16:14] was the the fighter of all fighters.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; But he would take that check home
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; and place it on the kitchen table to
[1:16:23] more than a conqueror.
[1:16:26] He would go out there and he would win
[1:16:28] every battle and he would gain the
[1:16:30] victory. He would get that c that that
[1:16:32] that check and he would give it to his
[1:16:34] wife.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; That's where we're at tonight, church.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ has gone to the boxing
[1:16:42] ring. He's gone through seven rounds
[1:16:44] with the devil and he has come out with
[1:16:46] a knockout punch.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; This message is the knockout punch to
[1:16:52] the devil.
[1:16:54] Did you hear me? I said this message is
[1:16:56] the knockout punch to the devil. That's
[1:16:59] why he fights you so bad.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Because if there's any church that you
[1:17:02] would like to get rid of, it's you.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; If there's anybody that you would like
[1:17:06] to trip up, it's you.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Because you are this close to reaching
[1:17:10] out and accepting your promise and
[1:17:12] putting it into action and saying, "You
[1:17:14] know what? I've listened to that Goliath
[1:17:16] long enough.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; I'm ready to write this check out for my
[1:17:20] deliverance. I'm ready to write this
[1:17:21] check out for my heal. I'm ready to
[1:17:23] write this check out for
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; It's not just screaming and shouting.
[1:17:29] It's a reality.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a reality.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I'm gonna have to bring this
[1:17:41] down somehow.
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; A reality of Christ's anointing on his
[1:17:49] bride.
[1:17:53] This is not a phantom madeup idea.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a reality here.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; You may not feel like it.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; You may not realize it.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; But you are anointed to take the devil's
[1:18:11] head off.
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; Everybody point to themselves and say,
[1:18:14] "Me."
[1:18:16] I am made
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; to take the devil's head off
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; I don't think everybody got it
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; me. I
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; am anointed
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; to take the devil's head off
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; tonight.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; You know the devil's already declared
[1:18:33] war against you. And sometimes we just
[1:18:34] think we're in code white not realizing
[1:18:36] that we're even in a battle.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; But the devil's got one over on you
[1:18:39] because we are in a battle. We've got
[1:18:41] battles to fight. And it is our job to
[1:18:43] take the devil's head off.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; We're going in rapture sometime soon.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; And there's going to be some of us
[1:18:49] there.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; I just believe that
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; God is coming back for us. He ain't
[1:18:53] coming back for the devil. He ain't
[1:18:54] coming back to the the bum on the
[1:18:55] street. NO, HE'S COMING BACK FOR YOU.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; It's got to be a personal relationship.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; This anointing is not to serve your own
[1:19:08] desires. That's right.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham, after
[1:19:12] vindication after vindication after
[1:19:13] vindication and vindication of healing,
[1:19:15] all these sick people got sick.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; The anointing was not for him.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Your anointing may be so you never get
[1:19:26] sick. No,
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; the anointing is to defeat Satan.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; How that happens?
[1:19:38] I do want to tell you, Satan will track
[1:19:42] where that anointing goes.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Random would say during prayer
[1:19:46] lines, he would say he would pray for
[1:19:47] these women. Then he goes, "Now the
[1:19:49] anointing that was on her is now over
[1:19:50] here and he would call it out."
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Well, the devil likes to track that
[1:19:55] anointing, too.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He likes to attack you.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham came in and he he
[1:20:03] he just exposed it like this. He said
[1:20:05] the devil is a great big bluff.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; He's a squatter.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. Right,
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; brother Miguel. If somebody came and
[1:20:11] squatted your building and they just
[1:20:12] took it over and said, "This is my
[1:20:14] building now." I don't think that'd go
[1:20:15] over too well.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; No, this is my building.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; It has been paid for.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; There's nothing I owe on this thing.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; This is my building. Amen.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; This is my family. This is my Bible.
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; This is my church.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; This is my message. THIS IS MY BIBLE.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Such as I have.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; Now verse six, Peter said, "Silver and
[1:20:46] gold have I none, but such as I have, I
[1:20:48] give to thee."
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth,
[1:20:53] rise up and walk. Now to rise up means
[1:20:57] to cause to rise,
[1:21:00] to arise from sleep or to awake.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say he would talk
[1:21:09] about the greatest anointing that's ever
[1:21:12] hit the face of the planet. That was
[1:21:14] when Christ went into the synagogue and
[1:21:16] he picked up the scroll and he started
[1:21:18] to read through Isaiah
[1:21:23] and he said this day this scripture
[1:21:27] is fulfilled.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to hear what brother
[1:21:30] Brandham is saying about that. Yeah.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; He says, "And now we would think
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; if such an anointing was on him,
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; he had been prophesying 800 years before
[1:21:40] that it would come and here it was with
[1:21:43] that type of anointing. For 800 years,
[1:21:46] this has been prophesied and has been
[1:21:48] building and building and building
[1:21:50] coming to a point for a certain point in
[1:21:53] time to where all of this would be
[1:21:54] fulfilled."
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; The full blessing and anointing of the
[1:21:58] Lord upon him. We would want to run all
[1:22:01] over the building, scream and holler,
[1:22:03] but the Bible said he laid down the
[1:22:04] scroll
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; and he sat down
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; and precious words proceeded from his
[1:22:09] mouth.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; That's
[1:22:12] what he done under the anointing.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to be screaming and
[1:22:18] shouting and dancing all over the the
[1:22:20] church to be anointed.
[1:22:22] But the greatest anointing that has ever
[1:22:24] hit the face of the planet was when
[1:22:26] Jesus Christ took the scroll, laid it
[1:22:28] down, and sat down and said,
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; "This day,
[1:22:33] this scripture is fulfilled."
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, but that's not a Pentecostal idea we
[1:22:40] want to have.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; We want to have screaming and shouting
[1:22:42] and hollering and I love those things.
[1:22:44] Those things are great,
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; but we're talking about an anointing
[1:22:48] here.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:52] Now, brother Brandham says, "The
[1:22:54] anointing is supreme power in control."
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Knowing exactly what and how.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; That is loaded.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Let me read it again.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; That's what he done under the anointing.
[1:23:09] The anointing is not emotion. The
[1:23:12] anointing is supreme power in control.
[1:23:17] Knowing exactly what and how. See?
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And then these next words he says
[1:23:25] &gt;&gt; and that is what's here.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; The greatest anointing
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; that has ever hit the face of the planet
[1:23:35] when Jesus Christ saying came and said
[1:23:38] this day this scripture is fulfilled was
[1:23:42] the greatest point in in history where
[1:23:45] the anointing would have been so thick
[1:23:46] and it happened and nobody knew it was
[1:23:48] there.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And brother Brandham is saying
[1:23:50] that that is what is here. That's right.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; Hello. That is what is right here. Right
[1:23:57] now is Jesus Christ's anointing. The
[1:23:59] greatest anointing that has ever hit the
[1:24:01] face of the planet. The greater
[1:24:02] anointing than what was on David. A
[1:24:04] greater anointing than what was on
[1:24:07] Moses. A greater anointing than what was
[1:24:09] on Adam in the garden. The greatest
[1:24:11] anointing that has ever hit the face of
[1:24:13] the planet. Is here tonight. And it's
[1:24:14] here for you. And it's here to give you
[1:24:17] your wants and your desires because it
[1:24:19] has been promised in the scriptures and
[1:24:21] vindicated by a prophet to give you an
[1:24:24] anointing call
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; to be anointed for this hour
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; to anoint you to face your enemy.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; I can't face it. You must face it.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; This battle is not ours. This battle is
[1:24:40] the Lord's.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Can I just say, Lord, use me. Lord, I
[1:24:44] want to take the devil's head off.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; I want to be anointed to be a devil
[1:24:48] slayer.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be remembered in history
[1:24:52] as somebody the devil beat up.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; Who wants to be remembered like that?
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; Nobody.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; But I want to be remembered as a man of
[1:25:00] faith.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; A guy that's willing to take God's word
[1:25:04] and stand firm.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; And I'll stand here and I'll I'll preach
[1:25:07] it to kings.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Come on. I'll preach it to anybody who
[1:25:10] will listen that this message is the
[1:25:12] truth
[1:25:14] &gt;&gt; and the truth shall set you free.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; So where is Christ's anointing?
[1:25:21] Brother Brandham said his anointing is
[1:25:22] on his word.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; But the letter killth.
[1:25:29] The spirit giveth life.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; So the anointing is the Holy Spirit on
[1:25:35] your life.
[1:25:38] So if you don't have the Holy Spirit,
[1:25:39] you better get the Holy Spirit
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; because without God, you won't be
[1:25:44] overcoming.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; The devil's real.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; He likes to make those boasts.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; And without standing firm on the
[1:25:56] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; Who knows where you'll end up.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; But tonight's another opportunity.
[1:26:06] for that anointing
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; to come down on your life.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Not only to be anointed.
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; I love how brother Brandham draws this
[1:26:16] out. He says, "You can have the Holy
[1:26:17] Spirit every day of your life die and go
[1:26:19] to hell."
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Boy, that was a shocker.
[1:26:25] We're looking for not only just the
[1:26:27] anointing, not only just the the the
[1:26:29] filling, but we're looking for the
[1:26:31] sealing
[1:26:34] finished work
[1:26:36] on our lives. God bless you.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; But let's rejoice that this anointing is
[1:26:41] for us.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; This anointing is for just right now,
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; not some other age. For us right now,
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; it's for you. It's not for your partner.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; It's not for the person sitting next to
[1:26:50] you. It's for you.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; This message is for you. Is for me.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; God bless you. We love you.
[1:27:11] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:23] Oh Jesus,
[1:27:25] that's the way.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; I need more
[1:27:35] of
[1:27:36] you.
[1:27:39] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:27:41] Till there's no room left in me.
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:50] All those wasted
[1:27:52] hours,
[1:27:57] they're yours now.
[1:28:00] From the start to the finish.
[1:28:03] I need more
[1:28:06] of
[1:28:08] you
[1:28:13] through it all.
[1:28:15] Oh, through it all.
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:23] Through it all,
[1:28:26] [Music]
[1:28:29] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:28:35] Yes, I've learned to trust in God.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. through it all.
[1:28:48] Oh, through it all.
[1:28:53] [Music]
[1:28:55] I've learned
[1:28:57] to depend
[1:29:00] on.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Oh my, aren't you glad for the anointing
[1:29:04] of the Holy Spirit?
[1:29:06] Oh,
[1:29:09] I've had many tears
[1:29:12] and sorrows.
[1:29:15] I've had questions for
[1:29:19] tomorrow.
[1:29:21] There have been times I didn't know
[1:29:25] right from wrong.
[1:29:32] Oh, buddy. In every situation,
[1:29:39] God gave me blessing,
[1:29:42] consolation
[1:29:45] that my trials.
[1:29:48] Hallelujah.
[1:29:51] All together, can we sing it with
[1:29:53] conviction now? Oh yes.
[1:29:58] You've been faithful to me, Lord.
[1:30:02] Through it all,
[1:30:08] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, I've learned.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Through it all,
[1:30:23] through it all.
[1:30:26] Through it all,
[1:30:29] [Music]
[1:30:31] I've
[1:30:33] to
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; I believe the Holy Spirit has been here
[1:30:41] tonight.
[1:30:42] The word of God has come.
[1:30:46] There should be no second guessing in
[1:30:48] who you are.
[1:30:51] The very fact that the Holy Spirit is
[1:30:54] moving in you to a higher call to
[1:30:59] believe
[1:31:02] his word
[1:31:04] is a fact that it's for you.
[1:31:08] God has ordained you.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; God's called you.
[1:31:14] You you and the word are synonymous.
[1:31:18] That's what the anointing does. It It
[1:31:21] makes you that word. It makes it makes
[1:31:25] you invincible.
[1:31:27] And the devil wants you to
[1:31:30] point you, many different directions,
[1:31:32] but that's that's not what we're called
[1:31:35] to do. The anointing is upon us to
[1:31:38] defeat the devil in every area of our
[1:31:43] lives.
[1:31:44] Aren't
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; you thankful for it? He's coming hard.
[1:31:48] He's coming hard. And if he can't
[1:31:51] destroy the anointing, he'll destroy the
[1:31:55] vessel that the anointing resides in.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; He'll try to destroy you. Stay with that
[1:32:02] word. You can't fail.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:32:09] Let's sing this second verse now.
[1:32:11] Hallelujah.
[1:32:15] I have been a lot of places
[1:32:20] and I've seen a lot of faces.
[1:32:26] There were times I felt so all alone.
[1:32:35] Oh, but in
[1:32:38] my lonely hours,
[1:32:41] yes, those precious lonely
[1:32:45] hours,
[1:32:47] Jesus let me know
[1:32:51] I am his own.
[1:32:54] Hallelujah.
[1:32:57] Through it all.
[1:33:00] Oh,
[1:33:02] through it all,
[1:33:07] I've learned to trust in Jesus.

[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; trust in God.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Through it all,
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; through it all.

[2:01:41] this song will be a blessing to you
[2:01:42] tonight. I can't get my book to work
[2:01:43] right, so I have to hold it. But brother
[2:01:46] Kobe had asked us to sing back in the
[2:01:48] back. And I had another song in my mind
[2:01:50] thinking about coming down here and the
[2:01:51] Lord has put this on my heart. And I
[2:01:53] hadn't sang in a long time and had to
[2:01:55] remember the words from memory. So if I
[2:01:57] mess up, forgive me. It's my fault, not
[2:01:59] hers.
[2:02:01] But I pray it's a blessing to you. I
[2:02:03] think that I'm very thankful that God,
[2:02:05] you can see the fruit of the Lord in
[2:02:06] your life. Has God changed you? I pray
[2:02:09] each one of you see it tonight that I'm
[2:02:10] not what I was. That's that's something
[2:02:12] that makes my heart so happy because I
[2:02:14] remember what I was and I'm not that
[2:02:16] anymore. I'm not that person anymore.
[2:02:18] And that's the grace of God to my life.
[2:02:21] If I were to tell you what he brought
[2:02:22] for me from, it would shock you. But
[2:02:24] that's his mercy.
[2:02:27] And I love him for that.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Tonight I have spent
[2:02:33] all the money
[2:02:37] I've ever owned.
[2:02:41] And I have squandered
[2:02:44] all my talent.
[2:02:47] Oh, there's nothing shown.
[2:02:53] But now I gladly come just as I am to
[2:03:00] Jesus.
[2:03:04] And I pray
[2:03:07] he could make his good in me.
[2:03:13] [Music]
[2:03:15] Oh, maybe he
[2:03:18] can make
[2:03:21] his good indeed.
[2:03:25] Oh, I know I'm not a star
[2:03:29] like someone else. I don't pretend to
[2:03:34] be.
[2:03:37] But this one thing I know for sure
[2:03:43] is my old wretched soul has found its
[2:03:47] cure.
[2:03:48] For he
[2:03:51] has made his good in me.
[2:04:00] This old flesh I wear gets so hard to
[2:04:04] bear. And it's sometimes sweet.
[2:04:10] My forgetful mind just won't let me find
[2:04:16] the words to speak.
[2:04:21] And every day,
[2:04:24] oh, Satan has to say that there's no
[2:04:28] need
[2:04:30] to believe
[2:04:32] that he could ever make
[2:04:37] something of me.
[2:04:39] [Music]
[2:04:42] God. Oh, he
[2:04:46] has made
[2:04:48] his good in me.
[2:04:52] Oh, I know I'm not a small like someone
[2:04:57] else. I don't pretend to be.
[2:05:02] [Music]
[2:05:04] But this one thing I know for sure is my
[2:05:10] old wretched soul has found its cure.
[2:05:15] Oh, for he
[2:05:18] has made his good in me.
[2:05:25] And this one thing I know for sure is my
[2:05:31] old wretched soul has found its cure
[2:05:36] for he
[2:05:39] has made
[2:05:41] his good in me.
[2:05:46] [Music]
[2:05:50] Amen.
[2:05:54] Hallelujah.
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad it's all him.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; Not by our own merits. Amen.
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; God bless you. Now, can we stand to our
[2:06:03] feet and ask the ushers if they didn't
[2:06:04] mind coming and and taking up an
[2:06:07] offering here tonight? Amen. Do you love
[2:06:09] him?
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless them now.
[2:06:24] Lord Jesus, we just come into your
[2:06:26] presence once again, Lord. And Lord, we
[2:06:28] thank you for
[2:06:30] the service and the chance that you've
[2:06:32] allowed us to have to gather together,
[2:06:35] Lord, to to be with our brothers and
[2:06:37] sisters, to to worship you, Lord, and to
[2:06:39] just be in your presence as we close out
[2:06:41] this year and begin another one, Lord.
[2:06:44] Lord, we just Lord, we know that tithes
[2:06:46] and offerings are are part of our
[2:06:48] worship, Lord. And Lord, we pray that
[2:06:50] you would just bless those that are able
[2:06:51] to give tonight, Lord, and and bless
[2:06:53] those that aren't. Lord, may it just be
[2:06:55] used for your kingdom. And Lord, may you
[2:06:57] just be in the remainder of the service,
[2:06:58] Lord. We just commit into your hands. In
[2:07:00] the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we pray.
[2:07:02] Amen.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; Let the weak say, I am strong.
[2:07:11] Let the poor say, I am rich.
[2:07:17] Let the blind say, "I can see." It's
[2:07:22] what the Lord has done in me. Sing that
[2:07:26] again. Let the weak, let the weak say I
[2:07:31] am strong.
[2:07:33] Let the poor say, "I am rich."
[2:07:39] Let the blind say, "I can see."
[2:07:44] It's what the Lord has done for me.
[2:07:48] Hosana. Hosana.
[2:07:52] Hosana
[2:07:55] to the lamb
[2:07:58] that was slain.
[2:08:00] Hosana.
[2:08:03] Hosana.
[2:08:06] Jesus died. Sing it now as brother Josh
[2:08:08] comes. Hosana. Oh,
[2:08:13] hosana
[2:08:16] to the lamb
[2:08:19] that was slain.
[2:08:22] [Music]
[2:08:24] Hosana.
[2:08:26] [Music]
[2:08:29] Can we sing that one more time now?
[2:08:32] Hosana.
[2:08:35] Hosanana
[2:08:38] to the lamb
[2:08:41] was slain.
[2:08:43] Ohana
[2:08:48] [Music]
[2:08:49] died and rose again.
[2:08:54] Amen. I trust the Lord has been good to
[2:08:56] you.
[2:08:59] Praise upon our lips. Amen. Did you
[2:09:01] enjoy the word of the Lord here this
[2:09:03] evening? Wonderful. I was blessed by it
[2:09:05] tremendously and I know you were as
[2:09:08] well. But if you would have your
[2:09:10] scriptures, let's go to Hebrews 11:17.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. I just love that the slideshow
[2:09:17] Sister Clelet put together.
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; Man, just it's incredible to see that we
[2:09:22] ain't serving a God of yesterday or of
[2:09:24] the history books, but he's still doing
[2:09:25] miracles today. Yes.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; And many times we think it's little
[2:09:29] things he's doing in our lives, but yet
[2:09:31] those are big things
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; that God has given us testimonies of.
[2:09:35] But Hebrews 11:17,
[2:09:37] by faith Abraham, when he was tried,
[2:09:40] offered up Isaac, and he that had
[2:09:42] received the promises offered up his
[2:09:44] only begotten son. Amen. You may be
[2:09:47] seated this this evening. Here in the
[2:09:49] church age book, Brother Brandham would
[2:09:51] quote that scripture and would say,
[2:09:53] "There it is. A Abraham was tried after
[2:09:56] he received the word of promise. Most
[2:09:58] think that as soon as we pray in Jesus'
[2:10:01] name over the good promises of God that
[2:10:04] there could not be a trial. But here it
[2:10:06] says that Abraham was tried after he
[2:10:08] received the promise. And and I think
[2:10:11] that is a powerful thing that talking on
[2:10:14] the lines of faith. Many people think
[2:10:17] that faith is just moving mountains and
[2:10:19] mountain moving faith and that is true.
[2:10:22] But many times faith is a patient faith
[2:10:24] where even when it's when trials are
[2:10:26] coming and temptations are coming, it's
[2:10:29] patience believing that God has the
[2:10:31] answer, that God has everything under
[2:10:33] control. And brother Brandham would talk
[2:10:36] about the young couple that prayed for
[2:10:38] would ask them to pray for their dead
[2:10:40] baby. And it was in Germany, I would
[2:10:41] believe. And they would call brother
[2:10:43] Brandham and ask him to come over and
[2:10:45] pray. And and as he was getting things
[2:10:47] ready, he would begin to pray. And the
[2:10:49] Lord would tell him, "Don't go over
[2:10:51] there, but I'm taking the baby home, and
[2:10:53] it's my will to take it home." So,
[2:10:55] Brother Brandon would call him up and
[2:10:57] would tell him what the Lord had said.
[2:10:59] And the mother or the wife would ask
[2:11:01] this question. Is it because of the
[2:11:03] weakness of my faith? And brother
[2:11:05] Brandham says, "Oh, no. Your faith is
[2:11:07] great." He says, "Anybody can have faith
[2:11:10] when mountains are moving?" But he says,
[2:11:11] "Let it go back a little bit and that
[2:11:13] proves whether you have faith or not."
[2:11:16] So here was a mountain moving faith
[2:11:19] where God was going to raise that baby
[2:11:21] up. But it was a patient faith knowing I
[2:11:24] might not understand what is going on. I
[2:11:27] might not understand why God has taken
[2:11:29] my baby home. But yet faith was still
[2:11:32] believing that God had everything under
[2:11:34] control. And we've been through some
[2:11:36] hard times through 25. Been through some
[2:11:39] wrecks hitting deer right here to deer
[2:11:40] there in Michigan. But yet God had
[2:11:43] everything under control. I don't
[2:11:45] believe that we go through anything by
[2:11:47] accident. I don't believe that we go
[2:11:49] through a trial by accident. I don't
[2:11:51] believe we go through a headache by
[2:11:52] accident. But God has everything under
[2:11:55] control. He knew it from before the
[2:11:57] foundation of the world. Man, it's real
[2:12:00] faith knowing that God has everything
[2:12:03] under control. But we don't like the
[2:12:05] questioning of our faith sometimes,
[2:12:07] don't we? Brother Brandham would talk
[2:12:09] about how when Jesus was walking by the
[2:12:11] woman with the blood issue and she would
[2:12:14] reach out and would touch the hymn of
[2:12:15] this garment and the Bible says she felt
[2:12:17] within herself that the blood had
[2:12:20] stopped. But brother Brandham says Jesus
[2:12:22] stopped and said who touched me to prove
[2:12:24] to her that it had stopped. So she had
[2:12:27] faith knowing that the miracle had taken
[2:12:30] place but to prove to her she would
[2:12:32] question her faith and would say who
[2:12:35] touched me. So, WE LIKE MOUNTAIN MOVING
[2:12:38] FAITH, but sometimes it's patient faith
[2:12:41] in the trenches. It's it's patient faith
[2:12:43] waiting for the fulfillment of the
[2:12:45] promises. IT WAS PATIENT FAITH BELIEVING
[2:12:48] FOR PATRICK to come home and to give us
[2:12:50] hearts of Christ. IT WAS FAITH JUST THE
[2:12:52] SAME in the middle of the waiting than
[2:12:55] it WAS BELIEVING THAT GOD COULD save
[2:12:58] him. And there's a song that is called
[2:13:00] I'm going to praise you in the waiting.
[2:13:02] While we're waiting for the answer, I'm
[2:13:04] going to praise you just the same. You
[2:13:06] might be waiting for prodals to come
[2:13:08] home. You might be waiting for prayers
[2:13:10] to be answered. It's faith just the
[2:13:12] same. You might not see it happening
[2:13:14] today, but it's patient faith saying
[2:13:17] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[2:13:20] forever. And I believe he's got
[2:13:22] everything under control. And the Bible
[2:13:25] would tell us that the trying of your
[2:13:27] faith workketh patience. And patience is
[2:13:30] an incredible thing because brother
[2:13:32] Brandon would tell us in the church age
[2:13:34] book that that God has many promises and
[2:13:36] the precious promises that he has given
[2:13:39] us. But he says from the time we pray
[2:13:42] until we get the answer, we must receive
[2:13:45] patience in our soul. Because many times
[2:13:48] we got faith when we're asking for
[2:13:50] things. We have faith whenever we put
[2:13:52] our petition to God. But when it seems
[2:13:55] like God is not answering, many times
[2:13:57] our faith is wavering. You remember
[2:13:59] Daniel, he would pray for 21 days. But
[2:14:02] he would not give up after the first
[2:14:04] day. He wouldn't give up after the
[2:14:06] second day. But it was a perseverance
[2:14:08] knowing if I keep my petition before
[2:14:12] God. The answer MIGHT NOT BE HERE, BUT
[2:14:14] IT IS ON THE WAY. AND I BELIEVE MANY
[2:14:17] answers are on the way. You might not
[2:14:19] have it right now. It might not have
[2:14:20] come yesterday, BUT THE ANSWER is upon
[2:14:23] the way. And the Bible would say when
[2:14:26] the angel would come to Daniel and would
[2:14:28] give him a message, the Bible says that
[2:14:30] DANIEL WAS STRENGTHENED BY THE VOICE of
[2:14:33] that angel. SO ONCE HE WOULD PERSEVERE
[2:14:36] WITH A PATIENT FAITH WHEN THAT ANSWER
[2:14:39] CAME, HE WOULD STRENGTHEN HIM FOR THE
[2:14:42] JOURNEY. AND WE'RE ALL UPON JOURNEYS
[2:14:44] TODAY. WE'RE WALKING IN the midst of
[2:14:46] Leo. We get tired sometimes. WE FEEL
[2:14:49] LIKE WE'RE WALKING by yourself. WE FEEL
[2:14:51] LIKE THE WORLD IS AGAINST US. BUT KEEP
[2:14:53] ON PERSEVERING BECAUSE WHEN THE ANSWER
[2:14:56] COMES, IT'S GOING TO COME TO STRENGTHEN.
[2:14:58] IT'S GOING TO COME TO ENCOURAGE. IT'S
[2:15:00] GOING TO COME TO UPLIFT. WE'RE GOING TO
[2:15:02] GO THROUGH SOME HARD TIMES IN 2026. BUT
[2:15:06] THE SAME GOD THAT HAS BROUGHT YOU
[2:15:08] THROUGH 2025 IS GOING TO BE FAITHFUL TO
[2:15:12] BE WITH YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY, EVERY
[2:15:14] TRIAL. AND WE THOUGH WE WALK THROUGH THE
[2:15:16] VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH, I FEAR NO
[2:15:19] EVIL BECAUSE OF THE PATIENT FAITH,
[2:15:22] KNOWING THAT HE IS WITH ME. EVEN WHEN I
[2:15:25] DON'T FEEL HIM, HE IS STILL WALKING WITH
[2:15:27] ME. EVEN WHEN I DON'T SEE HIM, HE IS
[2:15:30] STILL THE FRIEND THAT STICKKETH CLOSER
[2:15:32] THAN A BROTHER. HALLELUJAH. And it's
[2:15:35] incredible. I I was reading about Joseph
[2:15:38] the other day and you can look at Psalms
[2:15:40] 105:19 talking about Joseph until the
[2:15:44] time his word came. The word of the Lord
[2:15:46] tried him. Brother Brandon would tell us
[2:15:49] to be tested or tempted is to be tried
[2:15:52] is to be tested. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE
[2:15:54] BECAUSE JOSEPH WOULD HAVE A VISION OF
[2:15:57] his life on how that the stars would be
[2:15:59] bowing down to him and the wheat would
[2:16:01] be bowing down to him. So there was a
[2:16:04] vision over his life before he ever went
[2:16:07] through any of the trials, before he was
[2:16:09] ever sold as a slave, before he was ever
[2:16:12] lied upon, before he was ever in a
[2:16:14] prison cell. There was already a vision
[2:16:17] over his life. And what I THINK IS
[2:16:19] INCREDIBLE IS THE BIBLE SAYS THAT HIS
[2:16:22] BROTHERS WOULD SELL HIM as a slave,
[2:16:24] which is the opposite direction of the
[2:16:27] kingdom. It would seem like that he was
[2:16:30] going to SIT IN A POSITION OF POWER
[2:16:32] WHERE PEOPLE WAS GOING TO BOW down to
[2:16:34] him. But now HE IS BEING SOLD AS A SLAVE
[2:16:38] WHICH IS OPPOSITE THAN a king. And could
[2:16:41] you imagine UH THE MIND BATTLES Joseph
[2:16:43] might have been having that the Lord had
[2:16:46] told him he was going to be in A
[2:16:47] POSITION OF POWER AND NOW BE SOLD as a
[2:16:50] slave. BUT LITTLE DID HE KNOW WHAT THE
[2:16:53] DEVIL MEANT FOR EVIL. GOD WAS TURNING
[2:16:56] AROUND for good. CUZ EVEN THOUGH HE MAY
[2:16:59] HAVE FELT LIKE IT WAS THE OPPOSITE
[2:17:01] DIRECTION OF THE KINGDOM, IT WAS THAT
[2:17:04] CIRCUMSTANCE THAT WAS USHERING USHERING
[2:17:08] HIM TO THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISE.
[2:17:11] AND MANY TIMES WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE GOING
[2:17:13] THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF OUR VICTORY,
[2:17:15] GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF OUR
[2:17:17] ANSWER PRAYER, THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF
[2:17:19] A BREAKTHROUGH. BUT LITTLE DID YOU KNOW
[2:17:22] IT IS ORCHESTRATED BY ALMIGHTY GOD AND
[2:17:26] HE'S GUIDING YOU AND LEADING YOU TO THE
[2:17:28] FULFILLMENT OF THE PROMISE THAT GOD HAD
[2:17:31] GIVEN YOU. OH HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE
[2:17:34] WOULD TELL US THAT THE LORD WOULD THAT
[2:17:36] THE LORD WOULD REMEMBER Joseph and would
[2:17:39] make him prosperous. And what I think is
[2:17:41] INCREDIBLE IS THAT POTTERER WOULD NOTICE
[2:17:44] that the Lord had given Joseph FAVOR AND
[2:17:46] THEN THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT GOD
[2:17:49] WOULD BLESS THE EGYPTIANS HOUSE FOR
[2:17:51] JOSEPH'S SAKE. HOW COME? BECAUSE THERE
[2:17:54] WAS A VISION ON JOSEPH'S LIFE BEFORE HE
[2:17:58] WAS EVER IN THAT SITUATION. SO THE
[2:18:00] BLESSINGS OF GOD FALLS ON THE JUST AND
[2:18:03] THE UNJUST. MANY TIMES WE FEEL LIKE WE
[2:18:06] DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT THE
[2:18:08] BLESSINGS OF GOD CAN FALL UPON A
[2:18:10] COWORKER JUST TO PUSH YOU IN A CERTAIN
[2:18:13] DIRECTION. MAYBE YOUR BUSINESS MIGHT GET
[2:18:15] BLESSED OR OR THE LORD GIVE YOU
[2:18:17] SOMETHING FROM SOMEBODY ELSE. IT IS THE
[2:18:19] BLESSINGS OF GOD FALLING ON SOMEBODY
[2:18:22] ELSE BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT A VISION OVER
[2:18:25] YOUR LIFE. AND I SAY, DON'T GIVE UP IN
[2:18:27] THE HARD TIME. KEEP THE VISION EVER
[2:18:30] BEFORE YOUR MIND. WE'RE NOT A PEOPLE
[2:18:32] WITHOUT A VISION. WE'RE NOT A PEOPLE
[2:18:34] WITHOUT A DIRECTION. BUT WE HAVE BEEN
[2:18:36] GIVEN AN ABSOLUTE IN THIS DIRECTION.
[2:18:40] KEEP THE VISION. KEEP THE FOCUS. CUZ ONE
[2:18:43] DAY, THE FULFILLMENT OF EVERY PROMISE IS
[2:18:46] GOING TO BE BROUGHT INTO MANIFESTATION.
[2:18:49] BECAUSE LITTLE DID JOSEPH KNOW HE COULD
[2:18:51] NOT FORGIVE HIS BROTHERS UNLESS HE GOT
[2:18:54] SOME CHARACTER. HE HAD TO GO THROUGH
[2:18:56] CHARACTER BUILDING BEFORE HE COULD EVER
[2:18:59] REIGN. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US,
[2:19:01] YOU CAN'T REIGN WITH POWER UNLESS YOU
[2:19:03] GOT CHARACTER. AND IT TAKES THE TESTING.
[2:19:06] IT TAKES THE HARD TIMES. IT TAKES THE
[2:19:08] TRIALS THAT IS PREPARING YOU AND
[2:19:10] EQUIPPING YOU TO FULFILL THE PROMISES
[2:19:13] THAT GOD HAS FOR YOUR LIFE. Are you
[2:19:16] thankful for that this evening? Brother
[2:19:18] Brand, I'm going to say this here. God,
[2:19:20] I believe today before he puts his
[2:19:22] church in power, HE TRIES HIS CHURCH TO
[2:19:25] SEE WHAT it will do. AND I'M SO THANKFUL
[2:19:29] THAT GOD IS TESTING US, BUT HE ALREADY
[2:19:31] KNOWS we're going to fulfill THE TEST.
[2:19:33] HE ALREADY KNOWS THAT WE'RE GOING TO
[2:19:35] PASS THE TEST. AND I'M SO THANKFUL THAT
[2:19:38] GOD NEVER GETS SHOOK UP. He never gets
[2:19:40] worried when we go through the hard
[2:19:41] times. He never gets worried whenever
[2:19:43] things don't work out according to our
[2:19:45] plans. But yet, he knows the end from
[2:19:48] the beginning. Are you thankful for that
[2:19:50] this evening? God bless you.
[2:19:54] Woo.
[2:20:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight?
[2:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's powerful.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; As brother Jonathan gets ready to come,
[2:20:07] can we sing this? Oh, I will praise
[2:20:11] the Lord.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, I
[2:20:17] will praise
[2:20:19] the Lord.
[2:20:22] Oh, no matter what tomorrow brings, what
[2:20:28] it has in store,
[2:20:31] I
[2:20:33] will praise
[2:20:35] the Lord.
[2:20:39] I will praise the Lord.
[2:20:45] Oh, will you praise him?
[2:20:47] I will praise the Lord
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; no matter what tomorrow
[2:20:59] or what it has in store.
[2:21:02] I will praise
[2:21:06] the Lord.
[2:21:08] Amen. Will you praise him in 2026?
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I'M NOT STOPPING NOW. AMEN. God
[2:21:14] bless you. I love you. So so glad to be
[2:21:16] here. Amen. So Amen. I
[2:21:20] preach after all them, man. What What
[2:21:22] are y'all doing to me? Amen. Brother,
[2:21:25] that was wonderful. Truly enjoyed it.
[2:21:27] Amen. So, but you know, I just thought
[2:21:29] this week today, actually, I was
[2:21:31] thinking I preached a message back home
[2:21:33] a few weeks ago on on looking beyond
[2:21:36] yourself and looking at your sacrifice.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; All right. And I believe as we close out
[2:21:40] this year and we start this year, IT'S
[2:21:42] JUST BEEN A A terrible just a great
[2:21:44] burden upon my heart. If we can get the
[2:21:47] people of God to see that anointing,
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT,
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; TO SEE THAT ANOINTING IS TODAY UPON THE
[2:21:52] BRIDE TO SEE IT TODAY THAT WE HAVE THE
[2:21:56] POWER OF GOD, THAT WE HAVE THE FAITH TO
[2:21:58] DO THAT. AND AND IF WE LOOK IN THE
[2:22:00] SCRIPTURE, AND I BELIEVE BROTHER BREN
[2:22:01] WOULD TELL US WE NEED MORE CALEBS AND
[2:22:03] JOSHUA'S IN OUR DAY. AND I BELIEVE IF WE
[2:22:06] LOOK AT THAT SCRIPTURE, WELL, THEY COME
[2:22:07] TO THEIR PROMISED LAND. AND AND I
[2:22:09] BELIEVE WE CAN TYPE THIS AND WE CAN SEE
[2:22:11] IN 2025, YOU KNOW, I I'VE TOLD PEOPLE
[2:22:14] FOR YEARS, READ THE OLD TESTAMENT, READ
[2:22:16] THE NEW TESTAMENT, LISTEN TO THE
[2:22:18] MESSAGE, AND BRING IT TO WHO YOU ARE
[2:22:20] TODAY. BECAUSE THE OLD TESTAMENT MEANS
[2:22:22] NOTHING IF IT'S JUST A STORY. BUT IF
[2:22:25] IT'S LIFE INSIDE OF US, THEN IT HAS A
[2:22:27] MEANING INSIDE OF US. AND AND WE CAN SEE
[2:22:30] THEM COMING TO THEIR PROMISED LAND.
[2:22:31] THEY'RE COMING TO THAT LAND OF MILK AND
[2:22:33] HONEY, BUT THERE HAD TO BE SOMEBODY TO
[2:22:36] GO CLAIM IT.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. AND THERE'S A BRIDE
[2:22:39] TODAY THAT IS COMING TO A RAPTURE. BUT
[2:22:41] THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY TO GO CLAIM
[2:22:44] THAT RAPTURE AND SAY, "THAT IS MY
[2:22:46] ANOINTING.
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; THAT IS MY WORD. THAT IS WHAT I NEED TO
[2:22:50] DO." NOT SIT ON A CHURCH BENCH. NOT SIT
[2:22:53] THERE, BUT SAY, "THAT IS ME.
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; I'M THE RAPTURING BRIDE OF 20." WHATEVER
[2:22:58] IT MAY BE. WE'RE LEARING THAT TONGUE.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; THAT ANOINTING HAS BEEN POURED OUT. IT
[2:23:03] IS FOR THE BRIDE TO STEP UP AND SAY,
[2:23:05] "THAT IS WHO I AM."
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. YOU SAY, "OH, WE'RE
[2:23:09] SUPPOSED TO BE HUMBLE." YOU CAN BE
[2:23:11] HUMBLE BUT STILL KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS A HUMBLE MAN, BUT WHEN JESUS
[2:23:17] WALKED, THEY KNEW WHO HE WAS.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; OH MY. BUT THEY'RE STANDING AT THEIR
[2:23:24] PROMISED LAND IN NUMBERS CHAPTER 13 AND
[2:23:27] VERSE UH 30 WE'LL READ DOWN AND IT SAID
[2:23:29] AND CALEB STEALED THE PEOPLE BEFORE
[2:23:32] MOSES AND HE SAID LET US GO AT ONCE.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE THAT ANOINTING
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; COME ON CHURCH. WE HEARD ABOUT THAT
[2:23:40] ANOINTING. IT HAD FELL UPON TWO MEN OF
[2:23:42] GOD. AND THEY SAID WE'RE NOT WORRIED
[2:23:44] ABOUT THE ENEMY. WE'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT
[2:23:46] WHAT THE DEVIL HAS. THE ANOINTING IS
[2:23:49] UPON US TO CLAIM OUR POSSESSION. AMEN.
[2:23:53] HE SAID, "LET US GO UP AT ONCE AND
[2:23:55] POSSESS IT."
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; FOR WE ARE WELL ABLE TO OVERCOME IT.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE SAYS, "BUT THE MEN THAT WENT UP
[2:24:03] WITH HIM AND HE SAYS WE ARE NOT." HE
[2:24:06] SAID, "WE'RE NOT ABLE TO GO UP."
[2:24:07] REMEMBER, THEY THEY CREATED A LIE.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE DEVIL.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; HE TELLS YOU YOU'RE NOT WORTHY.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; HE TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T FIGHT THIS
[2:24:17] BATTLE. HE TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T LIVE
[2:24:19] ANOTHER DAY. HE TELLS YOU YOU CAN'T BE
[2:24:22] HEALED FROM THIS SICKNESS. HE TELLS YOU
[2:24:24] YOU CAN'T OVERCOME THIS. THAT'S THE LIE.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; BUT THE TRUTH IS
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; GOD IS ON THE SCENE.
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; THE TRUTH IS THE ANOINTING IS ON THE
[2:24:33] BRIDE. THE TRUTH IS YOU ARE ABLE.
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:24:39] &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, HE GOES AND HE SAYS, AND I
[2:24:41] WANT YOU TO CATCH THIS IN VERSE 33. AND
[2:24:44] HE SAYS, THERE WE SAW THE GIANTS. HAVE
[2:24:46] YOU SAW THE GIANTS?
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; OH YEAH.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. IT AIN'T GOLIATH NO
[2:24:49] MORE. I'VE SAID IT SO MANY TIMES. I WISH
[2:24:52] IT WAS GOLIATH. I'M A PURELY BURNING
[2:24:54] SCRAPPY FELLER. I THINK I CAN TAKE MY
[2:24:56] CHANCE. BUT IT AIN'T GOLIATH.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ENEMIES THAT FACE YOU AND I.
[2:25:01] IT'S OUR GOLIATHS IN OUR LIFE.
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; YEAH, WE ARE.
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; And they saw the giants, THE SONS OF
[2:25:06] ACHI,
[2:25:09] and we were in our own sight.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; AS GRASSHOPPERS,
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; AND SO WAS we in their sight.
[2:25:17] I want you TO SEE THAT
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; THEY DIDN'T SEE THEM THAT WAY,
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; CHURCH OF GOD. THE DEVIL DON'T SEE YOU
[2:25:23] THAT WAY. THE DEVIL KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.
[2:25:26] THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU'RE THE BRIDE.
[2:25:28] THE DEVIL KNOWS THAT YOU'RE GOING IN A
[2:25:30] RAPTURE. THE DEVIL KNOWS THE POWER THAT
[2:25:33] YOU HAVE AND HE'S SHAKING
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR
[2:25:38] YOU.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[2:25:40] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU think in your own eyes,
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THIS. AND YOU TAKE THAT WORD
[2:25:45] GRASSHOPPER. GRASSHOPPER MENTALITY. IT
[2:25:48] MEANS SEEING PROBLEMS AS HUGE IN
[2:25:51] YOURSELF AS SMALL.
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH.
[2:25:55] &gt;&gt; BUT WAIT A SECOND. I THOUGHT GOD LIVED
[2:25:57] IN US.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; IF GOD LIVES IN ME, THEN I'M NO LONGER
[2:26:01] SMALL.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; OH, BROTHER JONATHAN, YOU'RE NOT BEING
[2:26:06] HUMBLE ENOUGH. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? I
[2:26:07] KNOW WHO LIVES IN ME. I KNOW THE BATTLES
[2:26:10] I'VE BEEN THROUGH. I KNOW THE VICTORIES
[2:26:11] THAT I'VE COME THROUGH. I KNOW MY GOD IS
[2:26:14] ABLE.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; GREATER IS HE THAT LIVES IN ME THAN ALL
[2:26:18] THAT'S IN THE WORLD. HE DON'T HAVE A
[2:26:20] CHANCE.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; AS HUGE. YOUR SELF IS SMALL AND
[2:26:25] INCAPABLE. HE SAID, "OH, IS IT OFTEN
[2:26:28] STREAMING FROM FEAR?"
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH.
[2:26:30] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT THIS DAY IS MADE OF.
[2:26:32] EVERYBODY WANTS YOU TO BE SCARED.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO BE SCARED OF SICK.
[2:26:35] YOU'RE GOING TO BE SCARED OF CO. YOU'RE
[2:26:36] GOING TO BE SCARED OF THE BILLS. YOU'RE
[2:26:37] GOING TO BE SCARED OF THIS. AND YOU LIVE
[2:26:39] ALL HUNKLED DOWN IN ANXIETY AND
[2:26:41] DEPRESSION AND YOU WON'T JUST WALK OUT
[2:26:44] AND DO WHAT GOD WANTS YOU TO DO.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Comes from fear,
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; LOW SELF-ESTEEM, UNBELIEF PREVENTING YOU
[2:26:51] FROM SEIZING OPPORTUNITIES OR FULFILLING
[2:26:55] YOUR POTENTIAL.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:27:00] &gt;&gt; SEE, THIS AIN'T JUST NUMBERS. THIS IS
[2:27:02] THE DAY WE LIVE IN.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE WE NOT CLOSER TO GOD THAN WE
[2:27:06] ARE? BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR OWN
[2:27:08] MISTAKES.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; WE'RE LOOKING AT OUR OWN FAILURES. WE'RE
[2:27:11] LOOKING AT OUR OWN ABILITIES. AND WE'RE
[2:27:13] NOT RECOGNIZING THAT THE ANOINTING OF
[2:27:16] GOD HAS BEEN POURED OUT UPON OUR BRAIN.
[2:27:18] AND WHAT YOU SAY, HE WILL DO.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; He'll do it every time.
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; AND I WE LOOK AT THAT AND I BEGIN TO
[2:27:25] THINK, YOU KNOW WHAT? WE WE QUOTE IT ALL
[2:27:27] THE TIME. I DO MYSELF AND THE SCRIPTURE
[2:27:30] DOES AND BROTHER BRENNHAM WOOD. THAT HE
[2:27:32] CAME TO STEAL, TO KILL, AND DESTROY.
[2:27:35] THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; HE DID.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; BUT GUESS WHAT?
[2:27:39] &gt;&gt; He can't.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; He can't.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; COME ON. HE CAN'T.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO STEAL A
[2:27:45] PENNY FROM YOU.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO TAKE YOUR
[2:27:49] LIFE.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:27:52] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. LOOK AT THE TESTIMONIES
[2:27:54] YOU JUST SAW BEFORE YOU. IF IT AIN'T
[2:27:56] YOUR TIME, HE CAN SEND A FIRE AND IT
[2:27:58] AIN'T GOING TO TAKE YOU. COME ON. HE CAN
[2:28:00] SEND CANCER. IT AIN'T GOING TO TAKE YOU.
[2:28:03] HE CAN SEND HEART DISEASE. IT AIN'T
[2:28:05] GOING TO TAKE YOU. WHY? CUZ HE CAN'T
[2:28:07] KILL YOU.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; GLORY.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. WE GO TO A LIFE THAT WE
[2:28:14] LIVE NOW. AND IF YOU COULD GET THE
[2:28:16] MENTALITY THAT THE ANOINTING OF GOD WAS
[2:28:18] POURED OUT UPON YOU, YOU WOULD FACE
[2:28:20] EVERY BATTLE LIKE, "OH, WHAT AM I GOING
[2:28:22] TO WIN TODAY?"
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT ARROGANCE.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; THAT'S KNOWING THE WORD OF GOD.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; THAT GOD IS ON MY SIDE. I CANNOT FAIL.
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. OH, but brother Jonathan, THIS
[2:28:36] BODY. OH, YEAH. THIS BODY, TOO.
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; YEAH, I GOT UPSET THE OTHER DAY AND FUSS
[2:28:39] AT MY BOSS. THAT'S REAL SMART. COME ON,
[2:28:42] CHURCH.
[2:28:43] &gt;&gt; CUZ THEN I ALWAYS HAVE TO GO BACK AND
[2:28:44] APOLOGIZE BECAUSE GOD STARTS WHOOPING
[2:28:47] ME.
[2:28:47] &gt;&gt; AND THEN I HAD TO GO TO MY PASTOR AND
[2:28:49] TELL MY PASTOR, I WAS NOT A GOOD BOY.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; I MADE MISTAKES. I FAILED. GOD SENT THAT
[2:28:56] TEMPTATION AND I FELL. BUT I KNOW HE'S
[2:28:59] GREATER AND HE LIVES INSIDE OF ME AND HE
[2:29:02] CAN TRY TO STEAL. HE CAN TRY TO STEAL MY
[2:29:05] JOY, BUT HE CAN'T STEAL MY JOY.
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; HE CAN'T STEAL YOUR PEACE.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; CHILDREN OF GOD, WE'RE LIVING IN A TIME
[2:29:12] THAT IT'S ALL ABOUT ANXIETY. IT'S ALL
[2:29:15] ABOUT DEPRESSION. IT'S ALL ABOUT MENTAL
[2:29:17] WARFARE THAT WE'RE IN. AND THE ENEMY IS
[2:29:19] TRYING TO DESTROY YOU WITH EVERYTHING
[2:29:21] THAT HE CAN.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:29:23] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. IF HE CAN'T GET YOU,
[2:29:25] HE'LL GET YOUR LOVED ONE.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. IF HE CAN'T GET YOU TO
[2:29:29] FELL, HE'LL GET SOMEBODY THAT YOU LOVE.
[2:29:31] HE'LL TAKE SOMEBODY AND SLIDE THEM OUT
[2:29:32] THE CHURCH DOOR THAT YOU LOVE AND YOU
[2:29:34] WOULD LIVE AND YOU WOULD DIE FOR.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; HE'S AFTER YOU.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; But he can't.
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; He can't. He came
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; to kill. He came to steal. He came TO
[2:29:48] DESTROY.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; BUT HE CAN'T.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE CAN'T DO IT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT
[2:29:54] anointing
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; is now poured OUT UPON A BRIDE. And
[2:29:58] brother Brennham said, "You speak it.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; I'll perform it."
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS GOD SPEAKING TO HIS BRIDE. YOU
[2:30:05] SAW THAT WAS BROTHER BRENNHAM. THAT WAS
[2:30:07] GOD TALKING TO BROTHER BRENNHAM. NO. ALL
[2:30:09] THAT HE GAVE THE PROPHET, THE PROPHET
[2:30:11] THEN LAID IT IN A MESSAGE AND HE
[2:30:13] PRESENTED IT TO THE PRIDE AND HE SAID,
[2:30:14] "THIS IS WHO YOU ARE.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE POWER TO BIND. YOU HAVE THE
[2:30:20] POWER TO LOOSE. YOU HAVE THE POWER TO
[2:30:22] TELL THE DEVIL TO GET BEHIND YOU.
[2:30:25] YOU HAVE THE power
[2:30:27] &gt;&gt; to look the devil IN THE EYE AND SAY,
[2:30:29] "YOU'RE nothing
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; but a bluff."
[2:30:33] &gt;&gt; 2026 IS HERE.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:30:36] &gt;&gt; I CAN LOOK 2026 IN THE FACE.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; AND GO, DEVIL, I KNOW YOU'RE COMING.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; I KNOW YOU'RE COMING.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU'RE COMING.
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; BUT GUESS WHAT, DEVIL? HE'S ON MY SIDE.
[2:30:49] AND IF HE'S ON MY SIDE, HE'S DONE
[2:30:51] DEFEATED YOU. HE'S DONE TOOK THE POWER
[2:30:54] FROM YOU. HE'S DONE TOOK ALL THAT YOU
[2:30:56] HAD AND HE'S PLACED HIS ANOINTING.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; OH, COME ON. LET'S JUST BE REAL HONEST
[2:31:01] ABOUT IT. I WONDER IF WE COULD JUST BE
[2:31:03] REAL WITH OURSELVES AND WE COULD FORGET
[2:31:05] ABOUT OUR FAILURES. WE COULD FORGET
[2:31:06] ABOUT OUR THOUGHTS. COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:31:09] WE'RE HUMAN HERE.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; THERE AIN'T NO ANGELS IN THE BUILDING.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; WE GO THROUGH THINGS.
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; AND BUT WE COULD GO BACK AND WE COULD
[2:31:16] FEEL WHAT WAS PREACHED TO US TONIGHT,
[2:31:18] THAT ANOINTING IN HIM, AND WE CAN LOOK
[2:31:20] THE DEVIL IN THE FACE. COME ON.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "HEY, DEVIL, you know THAT
[2:31:24] ANOINTING THAT WAS ON JESUS CHRIST?
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD HIM KILLED,
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD HIM IN THE
[2:31:32] GRAVE,
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU THOUGHT THAT YOU HAD DESTROYED
[2:31:35] GOD,
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER ON THAT THIRD DAY, WHAT
[2:31:38] HAPPENED?
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Guess what?
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; That same anointing
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; is in me.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; And you can't
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; still.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; You can't. OH, BUT BROTHER JONATHAN,
[2:31:49] HE'S GOTTEN ME DOWN BEFORE. THAT'S CUZ
[2:31:51] YOU LET HIM.
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH.
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; GOD AIN'T WANTING HIS BRIDE TO BE SAD.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. GOD AIN'T WANTING HIS
[2:31:58] BRIDE TO GO AROUND LIKE A BUNCH OF A
[2:32:01] BUNCH OF POOR PEOPLE THAT AIN'T GOT NO
[2:32:03] JOY, THAT AIN'T GOT NO PEACE. NO, HE
[2:32:05] WANTS YOU TO WORSHIP HIM EVERY SECOND OF
[2:32:07] THE DAY.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S LOOKING AT YOU,
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; if you'll just see,
[2:32:13] &gt;&gt; get your eyes off of you,
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; brother.
[2:32:15] get it upon that sacrifice.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brennan would say, HE SAYS, "OH,
[2:32:20] I CAN'T DO it neither."
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, church.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; He says, "You say you can't live right."
[2:32:24] He says, "I can't do it either."
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; Come on. He said, "But he can."
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I love you. Amen.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight?
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can't we sing this song? Stand to
[2:32:41] our feet. Try this. I'm taking it back.
[2:32:46] Everything that the devil stole from me,
[2:32:49] I'm taking it back.
[2:32:53] Everything that the devil stole from me.
[2:32:56] Taking back my soul, my dance, my joy,
[2:33:02] and my peace. Taking back everything
[2:33:07] that the devil stole from me. Verse two.
[2:33:11] Oh, we all know that the devil comes
[2:33:14] still to kill and destroy.
[2:33:17] And I must admit that from time to time,
[2:33:21] he's taken away my joy. But I'm serving
[2:33:25] notice on the devil today. His kingdom
[2:33:29] is under attack. Cuz I'm born my way
[2:33:33] down to his gate. And I'm taking my
[2:33:36] property back. I'm taking it back. How
[2:33:39] many can say that tonight? Everything
[2:33:41] that the devil stole from me, I'm taking
[2:33:44] it back.
[2:33:48] The devil stole from me. Taking back my
[2:33:52] soul, my dance, my peace.
[2:33:58] Taking it back. Everything
[2:34:01] without the devil. Sing that one more
[2:34:03] time. Now I'm taking it back.
[2:34:08] Everything that the devil stole from me,
[2:34:11] I'm taking it back.
[2:34:14] Everything that the devil stole from me.
[2:34:18] Taking back my song, my dance, my joy.
[2:34:25] I'm taking back everything
[2:34:29] that the devil stole from me.
[2:34:35] That's your attitude tonight.
[2:34:37] Hallelujah. We've been hearing it. We
[2:34:39] have the anointing to do so. Amen.

[2:34:57] this song. So, if you know it, um, just
[2:34:58] sing it with us. Just seems really
[2:35:00] fitting for this time of year. So,

[2:37:31] Oh, to tell me a time he's not been
[2:37:36] faithful. Tell me a morning his mercies
[2:37:40] were new. Tell me a moment he was in a
[2:37:47] car through.
[2:37:52] Tell me a day he was less than almighty
[2:37:58] when he could hold back the time. Tell
[2:38:02] me when you look back. You're going to
[2:38:06] find There was never a day he was less
[2:38:10] than almighty
[2:38:13] when he couldn't roll back the time.
[2:38:17] Child, when you look back, you're going
[2:38:20] to find there was never a time.
[2:38:26] Oh child, when you look back, you're
[2:38:30] going to find

[2:38:50] wasn't faithful?
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you for that. Amen.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[2:38:56] &gt;&gt; As we ask brother John to come, can we
[2:38:58] sing this here? Um
[2:39:01] &gt;&gt; I trust in God. Just just the chorus.
[2:39:03] Hey,
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; I trust in God,
[2:39:08] my savior,
[2:39:10] the one
[2:39:13] who will never
[2:39:16] fail.
[2:39:20] You will never fail.
[2:39:25] Oh, I trust in God.
[2:39:30] [Music]
[2:39:42] fail.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll never fail.
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:54] &gt;&gt; Boy, what a night we've had tonight. I I
[2:39:57] tell you what, this this eating so good.
[2:39:59] I think we ought to have these services
[2:40:00] every night, brother.
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; It's uh good for a believer's heart.
[2:40:05] Amen.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then speaking of David, I I
[2:40:10] like David and you know because David
[2:40:13] was anointed. He was the anointed king.
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; But in Acts 2 and 25 it says, "For David
[2:40:20] speaketh concerning him. I foraw the
[2:40:22] Lord always before my fa face for he is
[2:40:25] on my right hand that I should not be
[2:40:28] moved."
[2:40:31] &gt;&gt; Therefore did my heart rejoice and my
[2:40:33] tongue was glad. Moreover, also my flesh
[2:40:36] shall rest in hope.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; I like that because we can rest. We can
[2:40:41] be at peace in hope.
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; And David was anointed and he was the
[2:40:47] the great king and and he never lost
[2:40:49] that anointing. That anointing didn't go
[2:40:51] away. He He was king. He was anointed
[2:40:53] king from the time that he was young to
[2:40:55] the time that he was old. David was the
[2:40:58] anointed king. Right.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; And also in all this time, God would say
[2:41:02] that David was a man after his own
[2:41:03] heart,
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; right? David was God just loved David so
[2:41:07] much to say, "That's my heart."
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; But do you realize how many mistakes
[2:41:12] that David made?
[2:41:15] &gt;&gt; How many times David fell?
[2:41:18] &gt;&gt; David was actually a murderer.
[2:41:22] &gt;&gt; But but let let but let me say this
[2:41:23] because there was a time when David
[2:41:25] turned around and said, "Blessed is the
[2:41:27] man."
[2:41:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. that God doesn't impute the sin
[2:41:30] too.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; Because there is a waiting time. There
[2:41:34] is a period in your time of your faith
[2:41:36] that you have to wait and the
[2:41:37] temptations come and all of these trials
[2:41:40] come and you're waiting and you're
[2:41:41] waiting and there's going to come times
[2:41:43] that we do fall.
[2:41:45] &gt;&gt; There's going to be times that we make
[2:41:47] mistakes. There's going to be times that
[2:41:49] we allow the doubt to stop us.
[2:41:54] &gt;&gt; But let us not stay there.
[2:41:56] &gt;&gt; David was quick to repent. David was
[2:41:58] quick to fall on the ash heap and say,
[2:42:00] "Lord, forgive me. Lord, Lord, don't let
[2:42:03] this fall upon my children," which was
[2:42:06] Israel.
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; David was like, "Don't let this fall on
[2:42:09] them. You bring this is me. Lord, I'm
[2:42:10] sorry. Forgive me."
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; And then he would stand up and he would
[2:42:15] continue being the king. He would
[2:42:18] continue believing in God. He would
[2:42:20] continue in the walk in the faith. And
[2:42:24] too many times in our life, we let the
[2:42:27] guilt fester. We let the pain in our
[2:42:30] hearts hold us back. We can't worship
[2:42:33] God. We can't have joy in God. It's not
[2:42:36] because God ain't there. God said he
[2:42:38] would never leave you. He would never
[2:42:39] forsake you. God ain't left you. God
[2:42:42] ain't gone nowhere. God is still here.
[2:42:44] So stop staying in the past. Fall on
[2:42:47] your spiritual ash heap and say, "Lord,
[2:42:49] forgive my unbelief and help me move
[2:42:53] forward.
[2:42:54] We are coming into a new year. We are
[2:42:56] coming upon the time this whole thing's
[2:42:58] wrapping up and we ain't got time for
[2:43:01] guilt. We ain't got time. We can come
[2:43:04] before the throne of God completely
[2:43:07] blameless.
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; We can come to him as though we have
[2:43:10] never ever done it.
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; So don't let the things of this world
[2:43:15] and the things of this life hold you
[2:43:17] back. Turn your face back to Jesus
[2:43:20] Christ and let's move this church
[2:43:22] forward and go out of here because I
[2:43:25] want to go home. You want to go home.
[2:43:27] The time is here and we can do it. And
[2:43:29] we can do it with a smile on our face.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; And I can smile even though it doesn't
[2:43:36] make me look good. I know. But I'll
[2:43:37] smile anyways
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; because the Bible never said I had to be
[2:43:42] goodlook.
[2:43:43] &gt;&gt; All right. It never said that. It said I
[2:43:46] had to believe. And brothers and
[2:43:47] sisters, I believe because blessed is
[2:43:50] the man and I love my God and I have
[2:43:53] faith in my God that he will carry me
[2:43:55] through. Will I make mistakes?
[2:43:57] Absolutely. But I know when I turn back
[2:43:59] to him and I say, "God, I'm sorry. It's
[2:44:01] as though I never did it in the first
[2:44:03] place." And you say, "Brother, how do
[2:44:04] you know?" Because the Bible also says
[2:44:06] that your transgressions go so far as
[2:44:08] the east to the west. Well, what is the
[2:44:10] east to the west, brothers and sisters?
[2:44:12] It's from one nail scarred hand to the
[2:44:15] other nail scarred hand holding your
[2:44:17] entire life in control. He's got it.
[2:44:20] Fall down on your knees and turn back to
[2:44:23] the heavenly father. God bless you all,
[2:44:25] brother Kobe.
[2:44:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Did you enjoy that tonight?
[2:44:32] Amen. Amen.
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I enjoyed that. I've been enjoying
[2:44:37] all the preaching so far. Amen.
[2:44:39] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. As brother Sam gets ready to
[2:44:41] come, can we go to F?
[2:44:43] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord.
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; Where would I be?
[2:44:48] You only know.
[2:44:53] I'm glad you see
[2:44:57] through eyes of love.
[2:45:01] Oh, hopeless gates
[2:45:05] and empty place.
[2:45:09] if not for grace. Once again, amazing
[2:45:12] grace.
[2:45:20] Lord,
[2:45:21] &gt;&gt; I once was lost.
[2:45:24] Oh, but thank God I'm found.
[2:45:29] &gt;&gt; Was a hopeless king.
[2:45:32] Oh, an empty space.
[2:45:37] If God, you sing that to him again. Oh,
[2:45:41] where would I be?
[2:45:44] Lord, you only know.
[2:45:49] I'm so glad you see
[2:45:53] through eyes of love
[2:45:56] was a hopeless
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; just an empty space
[2:46:05] if not
[2:46:07] for praise.
[2:46:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:46:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:14] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:46:17] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; God bless you each one this evening.
[2:46:22] It's such a privilege and honor to be
[2:46:24] here with you. We love you very much.
[2:46:27] &gt;&gt; Anybody know that about me?
[2:46:29] &gt;&gt; Enough of you know me that I love you.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; That I pray for you that we thank a lot
[2:46:33] of you. It's such a blessing to be in
[2:46:35] fellowship with you. I pray you know
[2:46:36] that about me.
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; I hope you don't think I'm up there
[2:46:39] plotting against you or anything like
[2:46:41] that, but we love you very much. We
[2:46:43] consider it an honor to be a believer in
[2:46:45] this day.
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I was thinking the other day
[2:46:48] had some discouraging things. Was
[2:46:50] thinking about some folks that have
[2:46:52] fallen away and that breaks my heart so
[2:46:54] terribly. And and I thought, you know,
[2:46:56] if this goes on much longer, seem like
[2:46:57] hardly going to be very many people
[2:46:58] left. And and it might be that way. But
[2:47:01] it's been the grace of God that's kept
[2:47:03] you and I.
[2:47:05] &gt;&gt; It ain't been nothing good about Sam
[2:47:07] Parker. Ain't one good bit about it. You
[2:47:09] young people don't think you're looking
[2:47:11] at someone perfect. Ain't a perfect
[2:47:12] person in the room
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; except the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:47:17] Amen.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; Uh, one of my favorite quotes from that
[2:47:19] day on Calvary, brother Ram said, "Of
[2:47:20] course you're not worthy. You never
[2:47:21] could be worthy, but a worthy one took
[2:47:23] your place."
[2:47:25] &gt;&gt; Now, there's a beautiful thing about
[2:47:26] that in this day, this dispensation that
[2:47:28] God's done through this open revealed
[2:47:30] word is what's happened is you've taken
[2:47:32] his place.
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; See, he already took your place back
[2:47:35] then. That was my nails. Those were my
[2:47:38] scars. THOSE WERE MY THORNS. HE TOOK
[2:47:40] THAT FROM ME.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; COME ON. YEAH.
[2:47:43] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:47:44] &gt;&gt; And now we're here,
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:47:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:47] &gt;&gt; And still here.
[2:47:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; And 2025 has been the longest year of my
[2:47:51] life. I keep thinking about things that
[2:47:53] happened years ago. No, that was just
[2:47:55] early this year.
[2:47:57] &gt;&gt; But I I I could spend hours and hours
[2:48:00] sharing testimonies what the Lord has
[2:48:02] done this year proving this. He's been
[2:48:04] faithful. Yeah,
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; we've had prayers answered this year
[2:48:08] that just we me and Bethany, we've we've
[2:48:10] had really burdened things. We we get up
[2:48:13] against a mountain and and like the
[2:48:15] prophet say, sometimes you you know you
[2:48:17] can't go through it. You can't get under
[2:48:18] it. Can't get over it. All you can do is
[2:48:20] let God do his thing.
[2:48:22] &gt;&gt; And there's times we've watched him
[2:48:23] completely move it out of the way in a
[2:48:25] moment. And other things you just sit
[2:48:27] still.
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it gets worse.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; COME ON. SEE, I'm not here tonight to
[2:48:34] sell you some flowery bed of ease. I was
[2:48:37] witnessing to some gentleman a couple
[2:48:38] years ago and they said, "Boy, you you
[2:48:39] sure ain't you ain't talking this up
[2:48:41] very good." I said, "I want you to know
[2:48:43] that if you set your foot on this road,
[2:48:45] if you step into this way, you better be
[2:48:47] prepared for battle.
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; YOU AIN'T FOUGHT A FIGHT UNTIL YOU TRY
[2:48:51] TO SERVE THE LORD. YOU AIN'T DONE
[2:48:53] NOTHING THAT ever come against A
[2:48:54] OPPOSITION UNTIL YOU BEGIN TO SERVE THE
[2:48:56] LORD." AND NOW YOU KNOW WHAT A FIGHT'S
[2:48:58] LIKE.
[2:49:00] &gt;&gt; And you can't be flighty.
[2:49:02] You've got to BE DECIDING. YOU'VE GOT TO
[2:49:04] BE SOLD OUT, LORD. I know.
[2:49:06] &gt;&gt; I don't care what happens to anyone
[2:49:08] else. I don't care if every PERSON IN
[2:49:09] THIS ROOM WALKS OUT. I WANT TO SERVE THE
[2:49:11] LORD.
[2:49:12] &gt;&gt; I DONE DECIDED. AND IT WASN'T SAM PARKER
[2:49:14] THAT DECIDED. IT'S THE GREATER ONE
[2:49:16] THAT'S LIVING IN ME. HE HELPED ME. HE'S
[2:49:18] THE ONE THAT BROUGHT THAT TO PASS. HE'S
[2:49:19] THE ONE THAT'S PRODUCING FRUIT
[2:49:21] ACCORDINGLY.
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; BY THE GRACE OF GOD. I'm so thankful for
[2:49:25] this message.
[2:49:26] &gt;&gt; Young brothers, young sisters, YOU DON'T
[2:49:29] KNOW THE GRACE OF GOD. THINGS GET COMMON
[2:49:31] WHEN IT'S your mom and your dad and your
[2:49:33] grandparents. It might GET COMMON TO
[2:49:35] YOU, BUT YOU'VE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE MOST
[2:49:36] POWERFUL THING THAT HAS EVER ENTERED
[2:49:39] THIS DIMENSION.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; YOU TALK ABOUT MERCY AND HE LETS YOU
[2:49:43] BELIEVE IT.
[2:49:44] &gt;&gt; AND I WAS RAISED IN THIS MESSAGE. I KNOW
[2:49:46] WHAT IT LIKE WAS I believed the message
[2:49:47] ever since a young boy, but there's
[2:49:49] times that I just want to do things out
[2:49:51] there.
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; I don't want to walk this way like I
[2:49:54] ought to. I don't want to do this like I
[2:49:56] ought to. BUT I THANK GOD he brought me
[2:49:57] back.
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; That's another thing you need to thank
[2:49:59] God for. THERE'S A SEED OF GOD IN YOUR
[2:50:01] HEART.
[2:50:02] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T PUT IT THERE. YOUR MOM AND
[2:50:04] DAD DIDN'T PUT IT THERE. HE PUT IT
[2:50:05] THERE. AND HE PROMISED HE WON'T LOSE
[2:50:07] ONE.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; All of you that are praying for your
[2:50:11] loved ones, you want to talk about an
[2:50:13] intercessor. BROTHER RAM PREACHED A
[2:50:15] SERMON called standing in the gap.
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THAT GREATER
[2:50:20] WORKS? THE PROPHET SAID THAT YOU CAN
[2:50:22] GRANT ETERNAL LIFE.
[2:50:23] &gt;&gt; YOU HEARD HIM SAY THAT. THIS ISN'T JUST
[2:50:25] RAISING THE DEAD OR HEALING THE SICK,
[2:50:27] GIVING THE BLIND SIDE, GIVING THE DEATH
[2:50:29] OR OH, IT'S MORE THAN THAT.
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:50:34] &gt;&gt; He made that commentary. This is supreme
[2:50:36] power in control.
[2:50:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:50:40] &gt;&gt; You want to see character on display?
[2:50:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:50:43] &gt;&gt; And let me tell you why. Let me read to
[2:50:44] you out of Deuteronomy chapter 7
[2:50:48] verse 6. He says, "For thou are an holy
[2:50:51] people unto the Lord thy God. You listen
[2:50:55] to me everybody tonight? Everybody still
[2:50:56] awake?
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; Have I bored you? Have I got you
[2:50:58] distracted? A word about something? Let
[2:51:00] Let me Let me keep going on. He said,
[2:51:02] "You're a holy people unto the Lord thy
[2:51:04] God. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee
[2:51:11] &gt;&gt; to be kicked down and run out and
[2:51:13] defeated and anxiety and depressed and
[2:51:16] broke and scared AND AM I NOT QUOTING?
[2:51:20] &gt;&gt; COME ON, BROTHER.
[2:51:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:51:23] to be a special people.
[2:51:27] &gt;&gt; And just like him, the the Bible would
[2:51:29] prophesied about him. There'd be no
[2:51:30] beauty that you're desiring.
[2:51:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:51:32] &gt;&gt; And as far as natural sight and natural
[2:51:34] affection, there might not be something
[2:51:35] your flesh don't want there, but oh, I
[2:51:37] thank God there's something deeper.
[2:51:39] &gt;&gt; I think there's God there's something
[2:51:41] deeper that was placed on the inside
[2:51:43] before there was a world. And it's that
[2:51:44] seed OF GOD THAT RESOUNDS BACK. IT'S
[2:51:47] THAT MAGNETIC PULL TO THE WORD. WHEN
[2:51:50] THAT WORD CROSSES YOUR PATH, THAT LIGHT
[2:51:52] COMES ACROSS YOUR PATH AND IT SPARKS IT
[2:51:54] AND BRINGS IT forth
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; because you're a chosen peopleless
[2:51:58] &gt;&gt; and he said you're special.
[2:52:00] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord.
[2:52:03] &gt;&gt; Bless
[2:52:04] the Lord.
[2:52:05] &gt;&gt; Was quoting the other day out of Psalms
[2:52:07] and he said the the heavens declare the
[2:52:10] glory of God and the earth shows his
[2:52:13] handiwork. All the firmament, everything
[2:52:15] there is. You know, there are galaxies,
[2:52:16] you listen to me, young people, there
[2:52:18] are galaxies that have not been allowed
[2:52:20] to even name yet. They're so far and so
[2:52:23] expansive and such just it's it's
[2:52:26] immersive to even imagine WHAT IT IS,
[2:52:28] WHAT GOD HAS DESIGNED. THOSE ARE HIS
[2:52:30] HANDIWORK.
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; COME ON.
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; You see, AND HE PUT EVERY SPECK OF DUST
[2:52:33] THERE. HE PUT EVERY SPECK OF PARTICLE
[2:52:36] AND ATOM. HE PUT EVERY BELT AROUND EVERY
[2:52:38] PLANET. HE GREW EVERY GAS GIANT, EVERY
[2:52:40] MOON. HE DID THAT THING TO SHOW YOU HOW
[2:52:42] BIG HE IS.
[2:52:44] ARE YOU IMPRESSED TONIGHT?
[2:52:46] &gt;&gt; AND NOW IN THIS DAY, THIS WORD'S COME
[2:52:48] FORTH.
[2:52:49] &gt;&gt; THIS WORD IS THIS WORD HAS COME FORTH
[2:52:52] AND YOUR PRO YOUR PROPHET TONIGHT.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; GOD SENT SAM PARKER, ELIJAH THE PROPHET,
[2:52:58] AND YOU CAN ACCEPT HIM IF YOU WANT. HE
[2:52:59] SENT HIM TO ME AND HE TOLD ME WHAT THIS
[2:53:01] GOD HAS DONE AND THIS SEAL THAT'S BEEN
[2:53:03] OPENED AND THIS WORD THAT'S BEEN EXPOSED
[2:53:05] AND THIS CHARACTER THAT'S BEEN RELEASED
[2:53:07] AND THIS PERSON THAT STEPPED FORWARD.
[2:53:09] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:53:11] &gt;&gt; And I'm impressed.
[2:53:13] I am impressed tonight.
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; AND THAT ONE CAUSED ME SPECIAL.
[2:53:18] &gt;&gt; THAT ONE CAUSED me chosen.
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, you thank God for that. HE SAID,
[2:53:22] "ABOVE ALL THE people that are upon the
[2:53:24] face of the earth, THE LORD DID NOT SET
[2:53:26] his love upon you, nor choose you,
[2:53:28] because you were more in number than any
[2:53:30] other people. For you were the fewest of
[2:53:31] all people, the least of these,
[2:53:34] &gt;&gt; but because Oh,
[2:53:36] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:53:38] &gt;&gt; You love your love story. Yeah,
[2:53:41] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm a hopeless romantic. I love a
[2:53:42] good love story. And and let me let me
[2:53:44] read that to you. A LOVE STORY. BUT
[2:53:46] BECAUSE the Lord loved me,
[2:53:50] [Music]
[2:53:51] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY.
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; GOOD.
[2:53:56] &gt;&gt; You put yourself right under that
[2:53:57] moniker that that he loves me.
[2:54:00] &gt;&gt; Didn't just love me before there was a
[2:54:01] world. Didn't just love me before there
[2:54:02] was a galaxy. He loves me now.
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; He know the mistake I made yesterday and
[2:54:07] the day before and the ones I make next
[2:54:08] week. He knew every time I fall, EVERY
[2:54:10] MISTAKE, EVERY SLIP, EVERY EVERY HUMAN
[2:54:13] WEAKNESS, HE KNEW IT. HE STILL CHOSE TO
[2:54:15] LOVE ME.
[2:54:16] &gt;&gt; OH, praise his name.
[2:54:18] &gt;&gt; He said he loves you. And because he
[2:54:20] would keep the oath which he had sworn
[2:54:21] to your fathers, hath the Lord brought
[2:54:23] you out with a mighty hand, redeemed you
[2:54:25] out of the house of bondage, you've been
[2:54:26] set free tonight, redeemed you out OF
[2:54:29] THE YOU REALIZE THAT'S WHAT HE'S DONE.

[2:54:32] age, of that latest AGE, TELLING YOU TO
[2:54:34] COME OUT OF THAT BONDAGE. COME INTO THE
[2:54:36] LIGHT. COME INTO THE WORD. LET ME HAVE
[2:54:38] FREEDOM IN YOUR LIFE. LET ME LIBERATE
[2:54:40] YOU.
[2:54:42] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; To be loved by him.

[2:58:14] I was lost when you found me here.
[2:58:20] You pulled me close and held me near.
[2:58:27] And I'm a fool, but still you love.
[2:58:33] I'll be a fool for the king of love.
[2:58:40] You gave me wings
[2:58:42] so I could fly.
[2:58:46] and gave me a song to color the sky.
[2:58:53] And all I have is all from you.

[2:59:39] Too much to carry. Nothing left to say.
[2:59:46] Forgive me, Lord, when I'm weak and
[2:59:49] lost.
[2:59:52] You traded heaven for a wooden cross.
[2:59:59] And all these years you've carried me.
[3:00:05] You've been my eyes when I could not
[3:00:08] see.
[3:00:12] And beauty grows in the driving rain.

[3:00:21] pain.

[3:03:50] Amen. Are you glad that he did that for
[3:03:52] you? Amen.
[3:03:54] &gt;&gt; Looked beyond your fault and saw your
[3:03:56] need. Amen.
[3:03:57] &gt;&gt; I certainly like to say that I've
[3:03:59] enjoyed the words that have been spoke
[3:04:01] here this evening. And u you know, I I I
[3:04:04] kind of felt like a semi failure. You
[3:04:08] know, I would think that between four
[3:04:10] ministers, I would have uh been able to
[3:04:13] amen 25 minutes out of each one of them,
[3:04:15] but I and be able to get a full hour so
[3:04:18] I don't end up here. But that's not my
[3:04:21] that's not my lot. And so um but uh I
[3:04:25] certainly have enjoyed the words that
[3:04:26] have been spoken here this here this
[3:04:28] evening, you know, and u you know I have
[3:04:32] um don't really have anything much here
[3:04:36] to say. I other than I love the Lord and
[3:04:39] I was just kind of thinking about uh the
[3:04:42] slideshow that was that was uh Sister
[3:04:45] Kala had made and I believe that she
[3:04:48] just done a great job with that
[3:04:49] slideshow and um
[3:04:55] and I really like those little
[3:04:57] slideshows like that because throughout
[3:04:58] the year you forget really what the Lord
[3:05:00] has done and even the small uh miracles
[3:05:03] that the Lord had done with the healing
[3:05:05] of the body and and different ones that
[3:05:08] had situations in their lives with
[3:05:10] breaks and uh and the Lord had really uh
[3:05:13] moved on our uh on our behalf here this
[3:05:16] year. And if I could just for a few
[3:05:19] moments maybe just give a small
[3:05:20] testimony, but uh there in there in uh
[3:05:24] second Timothy uh the first chapter
[3:05:26] starting at the sixth verse. is a
[3:05:29] familiar passage of scripture, one that
[3:05:31] I really like to kind of lean on when we
[3:05:33] talking about remembrance and but it
[3:05:36] reads like this. It says, "Wherefore I
[3:05:38] put thee in remembrance that thou stir
[3:05:40] up the gift of God which is in me in
[3:05:43] thee by the putting on of my hands." And
[3:05:46] I was thinking about this as we were uh
[3:05:48] going through the the slideshow and I
[3:05:51] was thinking about remembrance about how
[3:05:53] God that uses remembrance as a as
[3:05:56] something that we can do to relate back
[3:05:58] to what God has done. and going through
[3:06:01] that and in my life just throughout this
[3:06:03] this this past year. Uh you know, I've
[3:06:05] had a lot of uh ups and I had a lot of
[3:06:08] good days as well as I've had some bad
[3:06:10] days to go along with that. And and you
[3:06:12] know, thinking about some of the good
[3:06:13] times that I might have had this year.
[3:06:15] here. I've got to been able to spend
[3:06:17] time with my family and we able uh be
[3:06:20] able I was able to go uh do some
[3:06:22] vacationing and and be able to be uh
[3:06:24] with with my children and my wife and
[3:06:28] the Lord had blessed me be able to be
[3:06:30] into with in several meetings, be able
[3:06:32] to be there uh brothers and be able to,
[3:06:35] you know, be down there in Arkansas and
[3:06:37] just be into several places and just uh
[3:06:39] and the Lord has, you know, blessed me
[3:06:41] just uh just h had just many things
[3:06:44] throughout the year and and been
[3:06:46] thinking about those kinds of things. I
[3:06:47] just want to I just want to thank the
[3:06:49] Lord for all of those. But yet at the
[3:06:51] same time, uh I got to be able to be
[3:06:53] able to take everything as it comes. And
[3:06:55] sometimes that in life that we we don't
[3:06:57] just ride throughout the year on all the
[3:06:59] good things, but but there's a lot of
[3:07:01] bad things that have happened. There's a
[3:07:03] lot of things that in our life that if
[3:07:05] we're not careful, we begin to look over
[3:07:06] those things of of why God would put
[3:07:09] certain things in our life for us to be
[3:07:10] able to to remember back upon. and and
[3:07:13] thinking about some of these things. You
[3:07:15] can go back and you can look about uh I
[3:07:18] at the moment when I was looking back at
[3:07:20] the slideshow and we had that fire that
[3:07:22] was going on and and I had come home one
[3:07:24] day and they were talking about 60 m an
[3:07:27] hour winds and I was just kind of
[3:07:29] thinking like yeah whatever. You know,
[3:07:30] this is just the weatherman and this
[3:07:32] guy's about 50/50. And I begin to go out
[3:07:34] there and I look and the wind is going
[3:07:36] sideways. And I begin to look I look out
[3:07:39] the window and a bulldozer passes by my
[3:07:41] house and I'm thinking, "This can't be
[3:07:42] good. I've never seen a diesel with a
[3:07:45] bulldozer down the back of my deadend
[3:07:47] road." And then I begin I begin to go
[3:07:49] down there and there's just I go over
[3:07:51] the hill and there's fire just all over
[3:07:54] the hillside and I'm thinking this can't
[3:07:56] be good. And and the wind is be it was
[3:07:58] coming my way. And at that moment, I
[3:08:00] begin to think I was like, "Is this
[3:08:02] possibly going to reach my house?" And
[3:08:04] about 5 to 10 minutes later, it's past
[3:08:06] my neighbor's house and it's jumping
[3:08:08] over the it's jumping over the uh uh
[3:08:11] jumping over the woods and it's heading
[3:08:12] towards my place. And you know, you
[3:08:14] begin to think and all the brothers that
[3:08:15] had been there and uh doing everything
[3:08:17] that we could to try to make preparation
[3:08:19] for what was going on. And at the
[3:08:21] moment, you know, it just didn't really
[3:08:23] seem like God was there. But yet, you
[3:08:25] know, his people was there. And I knew
[3:08:27] that I had a promise that it didn't
[3:08:29] really matter of anything that anything,
[3:08:31] you know, these are just materialistic
[3:08:33] things. But, you know, the main thing is
[3:08:35] that my family's safe, you know, and it
[3:08:37] didn't come on me all of a sudden. And,
[3:08:39] you know, my my uh my family's down the
[3:08:42] road. And and I begin to look at these
[3:08:44] things and thank God for those blessings
[3:08:46] that were on my life. And I begin to
[3:08:49] look again down the road and I begin to
[3:08:51] see just a lot of little things in my
[3:08:53] life where you have uh spiritual battles
[3:08:55] that you go through. just things where
[3:08:57] the Lord has brought you through and and
[3:08:59] and there's and you could think of maybe
[3:09:01] financial troubles or you can maybe
[3:09:03] think of just uh fam family issues that
[3:09:06] would that you go through in your life
[3:09:08] and you can just relate to some of these
[3:09:10] things that are that are going on
[3:09:12] throughout the throughout the year and
[3:09:13] you can go back and you can thank God
[3:09:15] not only for the good times but Lord
[3:09:17] thank you for your bad times to be able
[3:09:19] to show me your plan and to be able to
[3:09:21] show me that you're there and to be able
[3:09:23] to show me that that you're real. And I
[3:09:25] begin to think about another passage of
[3:09:27] scripture. If y'all just forgive me, but
[3:09:29] but looking at another passage of
[3:09:31] scripture is uh there in in in the book
[3:09:34] of Psalms starting there in the 23rd uh
[3:09:36] chapter there in the 10th verse. It
[3:09:38] says, "Remove not the old landmarks and
[3:09:41] enter not into the fields of the
[3:09:43] fatherless." And I begin to think about
[3:09:45] how that why would God begin why would
[3:09:48] God throughout the year begin to have us
[3:09:51] experience a lot of these things that we
[3:09:53] go through. We have the good times and
[3:09:55] then we have the bad times. Now, there's
[3:09:57] a lot of times in my Christian walk when
[3:09:59] I go back and I look begin I begin to
[3:10:01] look at key situations and I begin to
[3:10:04] look at key areas in my life of where
[3:10:06] God has brought me out. And yes, on the
[3:10:08] mountain tops, those are some of the
[3:10:10] most greatest experience. But it's down
[3:10:12] in the valley and it's down in the
[3:10:14] stormy days and it's down in the times
[3:10:17] where it just seems like it there was
[3:10:19] just a dark cloud that you couldn't be
[3:10:21] able to press through. That's the moment
[3:10:23] that I realized God was the provider.
[3:10:26] That was the moment that I had realized
[3:10:28] that God had put me through those
[3:10:30] valleys. God had put me through those
[3:10:32] situations because he was developing
[3:10:35] landmark places in my life that I could
[3:10:38] look back in the fire and I could
[3:10:40] realize amen that he's the wind and that
[3:10:43] he's the water and that he has the
[3:10:45] ability that but I could look back when
[3:10:47] it was time that that that my bills
[3:10:49] couldn't be paid or I just look but I
[3:10:51] begin to look and be say God amen he can
[3:10:54] look down and he begin to meet my needs.
[3:10:57] Now the most great thing I love about
[3:10:59] Israel is Israel. Everything that they
[3:11:02] did, God wanted them to mark them. He
[3:11:04] whether it was stones, whether it was
[3:11:06] whether it was a sticks, whether it was,
[3:11:09] you know, whatever it might have been,
[3:11:10] he he done things that they would mark
[3:11:12] them. And and we live in a generation
[3:11:14] where they tear down the landmarks. They
[3:11:17] tear down of the things that we've done
[3:11:19] in the past. They they do it in the name
[3:11:21] of change. They do it in the name of of
[3:11:23] starting new civilization. And what they
[3:11:26] do is they do they they they they they
[3:11:28] take away the next generation's ability
[3:11:32] to see, Amen. what what has happened in
[3:11:35] the past. And what if we're not careful,
[3:11:37] we forget WHAT GOD DID IN 200 2025,
[3:11:42] moving into 2026. AMEN. WE DEPRIVE
[3:11:46] OURSELVES OF THE OF THE REMEMBRANCE. WE
[3:11:49] DEPRIVE OURSELVES OF THE LANDMARK. WE
[3:11:51] DEPRIVE OURSELVES, AMEN, OF THE ABILITY
[3:11:54] TO LOOK BACK AND SEE GOD AS THE
[3:11:56] PROVIDER. AMEN. HE WILL MEET MY NEEDS
[3:11:58] JUST AS HE DID IN 2000 OR 2025 THAT
[3:12:01] HE'LL MEET MY NEEDS IN 2026. AMEN. And
[3:12:05] my may not have food on my table in my
[3:12:08] life in 25, BUT IN 26 GOD WILL BE THERE
[3:12:11] TO MEET MY NEEDS. REMOVE NOT THE OLD
[3:12:14] LANDMARKS THAT GOD HAS DONE FOR YOU IN
[3:12:16] 2025. AMEN. Doesn't matter if they're
[3:12:18] good or doesn't matter IF THEY'RE BAD.
[3:12:20] GOD DONE THESE THINGS TO SHOW YOU THAT
[3:12:22] HE'S THE SAME YESTERDAY and today and
[3:12:25] forever.
[3:12:26] &gt;&gt; Now, sir,
[3:12:28] &gt;&gt; I have to be careful because brother
[3:12:30] Jonathan was was kind of dabbling in my
[3:12:33] in some of my thoughts that that I've
[3:12:35] been going into. Now, our brother, he
[3:12:37] was talking about that new land. Now,
[3:12:40] now we we think about this new land and
[3:12:43] God had brought us in had brought us out
[3:12:45] of the world and he brought us into a
[3:12:47] new land. everything that's been done,
[3:12:50] every miracle that's been performed,
[3:12:53] every healing on your body, every mind
[3:12:55] battle that God helped you go through,
[3:12:58] amen, on this earth is the evidence that
[3:13:01] there is a new land, AMEN, BEYOND THE
[3:13:03] JORDAN. AMEN. WHAT WE what we experience
[3:13:07] here IS JUST A TOUCH OF WHAT GOD HAS
[3:13:10] GIVEN YOU IN THE YOUR PROMISED LAND.
[3:13:13] AMEN. YOU COULD JUST GO INTO IT IN 2026
[3:13:16] AND KNOW THAT HE is there to meet your
[3:13:19] needs. God bless you. Amen, brother
[3:13:22] Kobe.
[3:13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I enjoyed that.
[3:13:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we go to Jean?
[3:13:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. As brother Harry gets ready to
[3:13:33] come, I see the evidence of your
[3:13:37] goodness
[3:13:40] all over my life.
[3:13:44] All over my life. Oh my. I see the
[3:13:47] promises. I see the promises in
[3:13:51] fulfillment.
[3:13:54] All over my life.
[3:13:58] All over. Sing that once again. I see
[3:14:00] the evidence. Oh,
[3:14:03] I see the evidence of you
[3:14:08] all my life.
[3:14:12] All over my life
[3:14:15] [Music]
[3:14:17] I see your promises in fulfillment
[3:14:22] all over my life.
[3:14:26] All over my life.
[3:14:29] [Music]
[3:14:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[3:14:34] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. Let's turn to 1st Samuel
[3:14:37] chapter 13
[3:14:40] and starting at verse 13.
[3:14:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:14:50] &gt;&gt; And Samuel said to Saul, "Thou hast done
[3:14:53] foolishly. Thou hast not kept the
[3:14:55] commandment of the Lord thy God, which
[3:14:56] he commanded thee. For now would the
[3:14:59] Lord have established thy kingdom upon
[3:15:01] Israel forever. But now thy kingdom
[3:15:03] shall not continue. The Lord hath sought
[3:15:06] him a man after his own heart, and the
[3:15:08] Lord hath commanded him to be captain
[3:15:10] over his people, because thou hast not
[3:15:12] kept that which the Lord commanded thee.
[3:15:16] &gt;&gt; And let's turn to Acts chapter 13.
[3:15:22] Acts chapter 13 and verse 22.
[3:15:30] And when he had removed him, he raised
[3:15:32] up unto them David to be their king, to
[3:15:34] whom also he gave testimony, and said, I
[3:15:37] have found David, the son of Jesse, a
[3:15:39] man after mine own heart, which shall
[3:15:41] fulfill all my will.
[3:15:45] You know, I think that we could probably
[3:15:46] go
[3:15:49] for a solid year, if not longer,
[3:15:51] preaching on just David. Yeah,
[3:15:54] &gt;&gt; it's so easy for most of us to look at
[3:15:57] David's life and identify ourselves
[3:15:59] somewhere in there,
[3:16:01] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:16:01] &gt;&gt; And I think it's one of those where
[3:16:03] David is one of those uh characters in
[3:16:05] the Bible that we know the most about.
[3:16:08] &gt;&gt; You know, you can know I know a little
[3:16:10] bit about Daniel. I know a little bit
[3:16:12] about Jonah. I know a little bit about
[3:16:15] the disciples,
[3:16:16] &gt;&gt; but David, we know almost everything
[3:16:20] about him, it seems like. And we go
[3:16:22] through this and we can pull out nugget
[3:16:25] after nugget about his life and we can
[3:16:28] look at it and we can recognize
[3:16:30] ourselves in different parts going man I
[3:16:34] struggle with those same areas or I've
[3:16:36] faced those same kind of trials or I've
[3:16:38] been through those same things.
[3:16:41] &gt;&gt; You know David was a man of passion
[3:16:44] which was both good and bad in his life.
[3:16:46] Yeah.
[3:16:47] &gt;&gt; You know, it was good when he came to
[3:16:50] his brothers and ended up facing
[3:16:51] Goliath. He didn't come looking for a
[3:16:54] fight. He didn't come looking to join
[3:16:55] the army. He didn't react until he heard
[3:16:59] the challenge.
[3:17:01] &gt;&gt; Until he heard Goliath speaking out
[3:17:04] against the army of the living God.
[3:17:07] Suddenly, David had to respond.
[3:17:10] &gt;&gt; He was just coming to deliver food.
[3:17:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't go looking for the fight. He
[3:17:15] didn't go looking to join the army. He
[3:17:18] was going to go greet his brothers, find
[3:17:20] out how they were doing, and go home.
[3:17:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:17:24] &gt;&gt; But the giant spoke out, and he heard
[3:17:26] the challenge, and it was a challenge
[3:17:29] against his God.
[3:17:31] &gt;&gt; And his passion rose up that this cannot
[3:17:34] stand. I have to go against that.
[3:17:37] &gt;&gt; His passion was good. And that it
[3:17:40] brought out his worship.
[3:17:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. that he was always there to to to
[3:17:44] worship. He was passionate for his God.
[3:17:47] &gt;&gt; But those same passions would come out
[3:17:49] to the negative as we saw him with a
[3:17:52] temper as we saw him, you know, most
[3:17:56] historians look at it and say that he
[3:17:57] was one that would battle depression.
[3:17:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:17:59] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that those that
[3:18:01] are great artists and great composers
[3:18:04] and great songwriters often battle
[3:18:06] depression. David falls into that
[3:18:08] category.
[3:18:10] He was one that he battled lust.
[3:18:13] &gt;&gt; This was one of his biggest failings. We
[3:18:15] all know this. This is common knowledge
[3:18:16] from reading the Bible and it's been
[3:18:18] preached on time and time again. His
[3:18:20] passions that could run so hot and that
[3:18:23] could make him be so passionate FOR HIS
[3:18:25] GOD COULD ALSO GET him into so much
[3:18:27] trouble.
[3:18:28] &gt;&gt; They could take him down the wrong road
[3:18:30] and they could lead him in to the wrong
[3:18:32] place.
[3:18:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[3:18:35] He was passionate in a good way for his
[3:18:38] God and that he wouldn't strike the
[3:18:40] Lord's anointed.
[3:18:42] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[3:18:42] &gt;&gt; Even though he knew that he had been
[3:18:44] anointed king, Saul was still alive and
[3:18:47] Saul was anointed.
[3:18:50] &gt;&gt; He would not strike the Lord's anointed.
[3:18:52] Even though his men told him that he
[3:18:54] should do it,
[3:18:56] &gt;&gt; and even though he had the opportunity
[3:18:57] two different times,
[3:18:59] &gt;&gt; he still wouldn't
[3:19:02] &gt;&gt; make that choice
[3:19:04] &gt;&gt; because he was still going, God anointed
[3:19:06] him. It's not by my hand that he'll be
[3:19:08] taken down.
[3:19:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:19:12] &gt;&gt; We know as
[3:19:15] brother John mentioned earlier that he
[3:19:18] was a man after God's own heart.
[3:19:21] And so often we'll hear our
[3:19:26] our Christian brothers and sisters that
[3:19:28] will say,
[3:19:30] "I want to be like that. I want to be
[3:19:32] recognized as a man or a woman after
[3:19:34] God's own heart."
[3:19:36] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[3:19:38] &gt;&gt; But yet there's something that we have
[3:19:40] to remember and that's David was in the
[3:19:43] Old Testament.
[3:19:45] &gt;&gt; David was under the blood of bulls and
[3:19:47] goats. He was a shadow.
[3:19:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and he was able to be a man after
[3:19:54] God's own heart. But at the same time,
[3:19:56] he was never freed of what he was
[3:19:59] struggling with.
[3:20:00] &gt;&gt; Those passions that were so much of a
[3:20:02] problem, he was never set free from
[3:20:04] those. That was something he had to
[3:20:06] continually battle and fight throughout
[3:20:08] his entire life.
[3:20:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:20:11] &gt;&gt; Y
[3:20:11] &gt;&gt; he had to go through those struggles
[3:20:14] because
[3:20:16] he hadn't come to the perfect sacrifice
[3:20:18] yet. who was still just the shadow, just
[3:20:20] the type.
[3:20:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:20:22] &gt;&gt; And now we can stand here.
[3:20:24] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[3:20:26] &gt;&gt; And we're no longer under the blood of
[3:20:28] bulls and goats. We now have the perfect
[3:20:30] sacrifice.
[3:20:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, we do.
[3:20:32] &gt;&gt; As our brother mentioned, he took what
[3:20:35] we were supposed to have.
[3:20:37] &gt;&gt; He took my stripes. He took
[3:20:41] &gt;&gt; my nails. He took my thorns. Amen.
[3:20:44] &gt;&gt; And then he gave me what he deserves.
[3:20:50] &gt;&gt; He came in and as brother Brandham would
[3:20:52] talk about in in adoption, he has
[3:20:54] brought us in and now he's given us that
[3:20:56] authority to where our name on the check
[3:20:58] is just as good as his name
[3:21:01] &gt;&gt; where when we come in and we can make
[3:21:03] the same business deals and stamp with
[3:21:05] the ring and we have just as much
[3:21:07] authority as God does. Amen.
[3:21:10] &gt;&gt; We have that authority. Brother
[3:21:13] &gt;&gt; in Philippians chapter 2 and verse 5, it
[3:21:15] says let this mind be in you which was
[3:21:18] also in Christ Jesus.
[3:21:20] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says in the sermon the
[3:21:22] spoken word is the original seed. He
[3:21:24] said they will love him love his and
[3:21:27] will have his potentials for he is their
[3:21:30] head and they are his subjects subject
[3:21:32] to his head. Headship of Christ was his.
[3:21:35] Notice what harmony. Jesus never did
[3:21:37] anything until seen of the father or the
[3:21:40] father showed him first. Harmony between
[3:21:42] God and Christ. See John 5:19. So will
[3:21:46] the bride and he shows her his word of
[3:21:48] life. He shows her and she receives it.
[3:21:51] She never doubts it. Nothing can harm
[3:21:53] her, not even death.
[3:21:55] &gt;&gt; For if the seed be planted, the water
[3:21:57] will raise it up again. Amen. Then I got
[3:21:59] a great big hallelujah. Here's the
[3:22:01] secret. The word is in the bride and the
[3:22:05] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[3:22:07] done with the word and she does it in
[3:22:09] his name. She has thus sayeth the Lord.
[3:22:12] Then it is germmitized. So the Holy
[3:22:15] Spirit waters it until it is grown and
[3:22:17] serves its purpose. They do only his
[3:22:20] will. Amen. I'll believe that no one can
[3:22:23] persuade them different. They have thus
[3:22:25] sayaeth the Lord. Or they keep still.
[3:22:28] Then they will do the works of God, for
[3:22:30] it is himself in them, continuing his
[3:22:32] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[3:22:35] his days.
[3:22:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22:39] &gt;&gt; David was a man after God's own heart.
[3:22:43] &gt;&gt; He was working towards the goal. He was
[3:22:46] trying to get there. He could see the
[3:22:48] target up ahead.
[3:22:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:22:50] &gt;&gt; And he kept running towards it. He kept
[3:22:53] trying to get there.
[3:22:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But he was under the blood of
[3:22:57] bulls and goats.
[3:22:58] &gt;&gt; He could only go so far. There was still
[3:23:01] a barrier that he couldn't cross. There
[3:23:04] was still a place he couldn't get to. It
[3:23:06] was always just out of his reach.
[3:23:10] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[3:23:11] &gt;&gt; And God respected it that he wanted to
[3:23:14] get there, that he was trying, that he
[3:23:15] was quick to repent, as our brother
[3:23:17] talked about, that he was
[3:23:20] that he wanted
[3:23:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:23:23] to be serving God to the best of his
[3:23:25] ability. He wanted to worship,
[3:23:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:23:30] &gt;&gt; But yet, we as the bride can stand here
[3:23:33] and we're not just men and women after
[3:23:37] God's own heart.
[3:23:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:23:39] &gt;&gt; But we now have that anointing on us. We
[3:23:42] now have the inddwelling. We now have
[3:23:45] &gt;&gt; we have now been sealed to where
[3:23:47] &gt;&gt; it is God living within us. It is now
[3:23:51] the very heart of Christ inside us.
[3:23:54] We're not trying to get there. It's in
[3:23:56] us and we're living it out. We're
[3:23:58] manifesting. We speak what he speaks.
[3:24:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24:02] &gt;&gt; We use the same word that he does. We
[3:24:05] know his wants. We know his likes. WE
[3:24:08] KNOW WHAT HE DESIRES. And that is our
[3:24:11] very desire to live out what he wants.
[3:24:15] To live out how he instructs us.
[3:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. to manifest the same word that he
[3:24:21] spoke from the beginning.
[3:24:22] &gt;&gt; Godl
[3:24:24] &gt;&gt; in the church age book it says notice
[3:24:26] the harmony of the father and the son.
[3:24:28] Jesus never did anything until it was
[3:24:30] first showed him by the father. John
[3:24:33] 5:19 the harmony is now to exist between
[3:24:35] the groom and his bride. He shows her
[3:24:38] his word of life. She receives it.
[3:24:41] &gt;&gt; She never doubts it. Therefore nothing
[3:24:43] can harm her, not even death. For if the
[3:24:46] seed be planted, the water will raise it
[3:24:48] up again. Here is the secret of this.
[3:24:51] The word is in the bride as it was in
[3:24:54] Mary.
[3:24:55] &gt;&gt; The bride has the mind of Christ, for
[3:24:57] she knows what he wants done with the
[3:24:59] word. She performs the command of the
[3:25:02] word in his name, for she has thus
[3:25:04] sayeth the Lord. Then the word is
[3:25:06] quickened by the spirit, and it comes to
[3:25:08] pass. Like a seed that is planted and
[3:25:11] watered, it comes to full harvest
[3:25:13] serving its purpose.
[3:25:17] &gt;&gt; We love to
[3:25:20] minister on David. We love to read about
[3:25:22] David. We love to identify ourselves
[3:25:25] because he's just so human. He's just so
[3:25:29] much like us.
[3:25:32] But God isn't calling us to be like
[3:25:35] David.
[3:25:36] &gt;&gt; God isn't calling us and going up here.
[3:25:38] Here's David. He is the ultimate goal of
[3:25:42] what you want to be.
[3:25:44] &gt;&gt; No, David was running. He was trying to
[3:25:48] get there. He was going after that heart
[3:25:51] of God.
[3:25:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[3:25:53] &gt;&gt; But yet, God has come and opened up
[3:25:55] those seven seals and revealed his word
[3:25:58] to us and come to live inside the heart
[3:26:00] of his bride to identify himself with us
[3:26:03] to go, you are no longer brother Josh
[3:26:06] Martin. You are now Mrs. Jesus Christ.
[3:26:11] &gt;&gt; You are no longer Luke Lancaster.
[3:26:14] &gt;&gt; You are Mrs. Jesus Christ. You are
[3:26:16] identified by a different name. You are
[3:26:19] given a different authority to where we
[3:26:22] no longer have to continue to battle the
[3:26:24] same things over and over like David
[3:26:26] did.
[3:26:27] &gt;&gt; David had to keep battling those
[3:26:29] passions over and over and over.
[3:26:33] &gt;&gt; But yet God gives us the overcoming
[3:26:35] power. God gives us the authority
[3:26:39] to say we don't have to continue to
[3:26:41] fight the same thing over and over
[3:26:43] again.
[3:26:45] &gt;&gt; Now, we're going to stumble and fall.
[3:26:46] We're going to make mistakes. We're
[3:26:48] still human beings. We're still in this
[3:26:50] sinful flesh.
[3:26:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[3:26:53] &gt;&gt; But our desire
[3:26:56] at the very center
[3:26:58] &gt;&gt; is Christ's desire.
[3:27:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:27:01] &gt;&gt; We want to live the way he tells us to.
[3:27:04] We want to manifest the word that he's
[3:27:07] spoken. We want to take his word and be
[3:27:10] living it on this earth.
[3:27:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.

[3:39:59] that name.
[3:40:01] [Music]

[3:40:04] [Music]
[3:40:06] Aren't you glad that

[3:40:11] Jesus?
[3:40:15] &gt;&gt; It's such a a wonderful thing. It's a
[3:40:18] treasure
[3:40:20] to know the Lord and to
[3:40:23] have this relationship with him.
[3:40:27] Listening to these messages that have
[3:40:29] been preached tonight, I tell you what a
[3:40:34] what a wonderful thing it is
[3:40:38] to have such a wonderful rich word.
[3:40:41] You can be seated here for a few
[3:40:43] moments. We're fixing to have communion.
[3:40:48] Have you enjoyed yourself this evening?
[3:40:58] &gt;&gt; We've got 27 28 minutes before
[3:41:02] the turn of the new year
[3:41:05] and um
[3:41:07] we truly have been blessed. I
[3:41:11] thinking of our our brother Sam and
[3:41:14] sister Bethany as they just had their
[3:41:17] house catch on fire and and and
[3:41:22] how gracious God was to you all and how
[3:41:25] it could have been such a tragic thing
[3:41:27] and God got you all out and
[3:41:32] &gt;&gt; you know how how
[3:41:38] you know no one even knows this. I just
[3:41:43] not even all my family
[3:41:47] uh
[3:41:49] I was driving that old dump truck the
[3:41:51] other day and and um
[3:41:58] you know it's always had been a little
[3:42:00] rough on brakes and but I've always I've
[3:42:03] been able to stop it. you know, I've got
[3:42:05] my using using the the the brakes and
[3:42:08] then my my pedal or my my emergency
[3:42:10] brake and and um so I putt putt down to
[3:42:14] get gravel and bring it back and then
[3:42:19] I had some of Caleb and Tina's kids with
[3:42:22] me and
[3:42:24] and um as we're coming into we we come
[3:42:27] into town, I've got a load of gravel and
[3:42:30] um
[3:42:33] my brakes gave out.
[3:42:36] We're at the train tracks
[3:42:38] and um
[3:42:41] tracks are the the the deals are down
[3:42:44] and I'm I'm I'm grinding my gears. I'm
[3:42:47] doing everything I can. I can't there's
[3:42:50] there's no stopping. There's no
[3:42:52] stopping.
[3:42:54] I had a car in front of me.
[3:42:59] And if I hit the car,
[3:43:02] I' I'd push it out. I could hear the
[3:43:06] train blaring. All this is all going on.
[3:43:09] And I um
[3:43:14] I I I'm grinding my gears trying to I
[3:43:17] you know, I'm trying to get it down into
[3:43:18] granny and I can't get it. And so I just
[3:43:20] made the decision,
[3:43:24] you know. I I just I just
[3:43:29] drop it down into second and push it
[3:43:32] with everything I've got. And u busted
[3:43:36] through the barriers
[3:43:39] and u that train train came right just
[3:43:43] just right behind me.
[3:43:49] I stopped once I was able to get it
[3:43:51] stopped. I thought I was just shaking
[3:43:57] like, you know, you go up the hill as
[3:43:59] you're as you go across those tracks and
[3:44:01] I I just let her rope to a stop and I
[3:44:03] just
[3:44:06] I mean I I looked at her
[3:44:09] it
[3:44:11] it was it was bad.
[3:44:14] [Music]
[3:44:15] I just had Fresa come come pick us up.
[3:44:19] And uh
[3:44:24] as I looked there and I thought, God,
[3:44:28] if it hadn't been for your grace,
[3:44:32] if it hadn't been for your grace,
[3:44:34] [Music]
[3:44:39] &gt;&gt; things don't always
[3:44:42] we sometimes we don't
[3:44:45] we we just don't give God the credit
[3:44:47] that he deserves.
[3:44:49] [Music]
[3:44:55] And I I just I I just want us to stop
[3:44:58] and think.
[3:45:00] I mean, that was close. That I mean,
[3:45:02] that that Duck on it. It Listen, guys. I
[3:45:05] mean, we we're we're talking about
[3:45:06] seconds. We're
[3:45:08] It was close.
[3:45:15] And I was so shaken for days. I just
[3:45:19] nightmares, you know,
[3:45:22] but ultimately God,
[3:45:26] God has been good to us.
[3:45:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:45:32] &gt;&gt; And as we go into this
[3:45:35] new year,
[3:45:38] I think we should go in with confidence.
[3:45:40] I I I like I like the way Brother Harry
[3:45:42] brought that out.
[3:45:46] Under the old law of bulls and goats
[3:45:48] there there was no Holy Ghost. There was
[3:45:51] no overcoming power. There was over the
[3:45:54] sin nature.
[3:45:56] But through the blood of Jesus Christ,
[3:46:00] the Holy Ghost can come upon us and he
[3:46:03] can
[3:46:06] give us victory over those things in our
[3:46:08] lives.
[3:46:10] &gt;&gt; I want to live pure before him and
[3:46:11] honest before him.
[3:46:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:46:15] as we get ready for communion. And as we
[3:46:19] read it here,
[3:46:21] what we're going to do is is um fixing
[3:46:25] to have you to just come up through the
[3:46:27] through the center aisle here and then
[3:46:29] we'll um each each of your families, you
[3:46:32] can come and take communion.
[3:46:35] But 1 Corinthians 11 and23, I have
[3:46:38] received of the Lord that which also I
[3:46:41] delivered unto you,
[3:46:46] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[3:46:49] which he was betrayed, took bread,
[3:46:54] and when he had given thanks, he broke
[3:46:56] it
[3:46:57] and said, "Take, eat.
[3:47:01] This is my body
[3:47:05] that is broken for you.
[3:47:08] Do this in remembrance of me.
[3:47:12] After the same manner also he took the
[3:47:15] cup when he had sucked, saying,
[3:47:18] "This cup is the new testament in my
[3:47:21] blood.
[3:47:22] [Music]
[3:47:24] This do ye as often as ye drink it in
[3:47:27] remembrance of me.
[3:47:30] For as often as you eat this bread and
[3:47:33] drink this cup,
[3:47:35] you do show the Lord's death till he
[3:47:38] come.
[3:47:40] Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this
[3:47:42] bread and drink this this cup of the
[3:47:46] Lord unworthily
[3:47:49] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[3:47:51] the Lord.
[3:47:53] But let a man examine himself,
[3:47:56] and so let him eat of that bread,
[3:48:00] and drink of that cup.
[3:48:03] For he that eateth and drinkkeeth
[3:48:06] unworthily,
[3:48:08] eateth and drinkkeeth damnation to
[3:48:10] himself,
[3:48:14] not discerning the Lord's body.
[3:48:18] For this cause
[3:48:20] are many are weak and sickly among you
[3:48:24] and many sleep. But if we would judge
[3:48:28] ourselves,
[3:48:29] we should be judged.
[3:48:32] But when we are judged, we are chasened
[3:48:35] of the Lord that we be not condemned
[3:48:38] with the world.
[3:48:41] Wherefore, my brethren, when you come
[3:48:42] together to eat, tarry one for another,
[3:48:46] and if any man hunger, let him eat at
[3:48:49] home, that ye come not together in
[3:48:52] condemnation. The rest I will set in
[3:48:54] order when I come.
[3:48:58] So, as we look here and we
[3:49:03] are are coming
[3:49:08] into take communion.
[3:49:11] I think these brothers have brought it
[3:49:13] out. These these were every one of these
[3:49:16] were just absolute masterpieces tonight.
[3:49:20] Brother Brother Ben, what a blessing.
[3:49:23] What a blessing.
[3:49:25] you other brothers, the gifts of God
[3:49:28] that you have expressed tonight,
[3:49:31] it
[3:49:33] you're a blessing to the body of Christ.
[3:49:35] We need you, men. We need these gifts
[3:49:39] because if there's ever anything that we
[3:49:42] need,
[3:49:44] the bride's got to be free from
[3:49:46] condemnation.
[3:49:49] And if this message ever needed to be
[3:49:51] preached loud and declared strong,
[3:49:54] &gt;&gt; it needs to be declared today
[3:49:58] that he lives.
[3:49:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:50:00] &gt;&gt; He lives.
[3:50:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:50:02] And so as we as we get ready,
[3:50:08] I I want my heart I I I want us to judge
[3:50:12] our hearts here tonight as and we can
[3:50:14] start lining up because we don't have
[3:50:16] much time.
[3:50:18] We got 20 minutes. So we can start
[3:50:20] lining up here in the middle by your
[3:50:21] families. I if if you've not
[3:50:27] if you've not been born again then we
[3:50:29] would rather you not take the communion.
[3:50:32] This is only for the for the born again
[3:50:34] those who have following Christ
[3:50:39] full of the Holy Ghost.
[3:50:42] And uh
[3:50:46] I I wonder um
[3:50:49] brother brother Sam, why don't you and
[3:50:52] your wife come? Would you would you come
[3:50:54] and serve communion to me and then I'll
[3:50:57] my wife and then I'll serve. Sister
[3:50:59] Bethany, you come with him. We're we're
[3:51:01] so thankful for brother Sam and and
[3:51:08] brother Jonathan coming and and being a
[3:51:10] part. wives coming with them.
[3:51:15] The bread is right here. And so we will
[3:51:19] uh
[3:51:21] we're going to pray over it right now.
[3:51:25] Let's let's pray. Lord Jesus,
[3:51:29] we just ask Lord that you would take
[3:51:31] this bread.
[3:51:34] [Music]
[3:51:37] We ask Lord that
[3:51:39] as there is nothing this wine or bread
[3:51:43] that could ever save us.
[3:51:46] This is simply symbolic of your grace to
[3:51:49] us.
[3:51:51] I pray Lord Jesus
[3:51:53] that you would bless it.
[3:51:56] Lord, may may this representation may
[3:51:59] there be as fresh anointing fall
[3:52:02] as your blood was shed on Calvary for us
[3:52:07] as you your flesh was torn for us.
[3:52:12] We take Lord, we take your blood, we
[3:52:16] take your word and we apply it to our
[3:52:19] lives. forgive us of our sins and our
[3:52:22] wrongs and let us live for you
[3:52:25] this coming year in Jesus name.
[3:52:29] Amen. And amen.
[3:52:32] And what we want to do, mama, if you
[3:52:33] would just step back and I'm just going
[3:52:35] to serve you and your wife.
[3:52:41] Oh God,
[3:52:43] [Music]
[3:52:47] I know
[3:52:50] my heart.
