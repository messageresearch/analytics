[36:46] for me I
[36:48] went there and it's like as soon as I
[36:49] got into Camp it's like I just couldn't
[36:51] focus on nothing like
[36:53] sit in the services and I'm trying to
[36:55] get into it but the devil is just
[36:56] fighting me on
[36:58] on a lot of stuff it's just
[37:01] trying to sit there and distract me as I
[37:04] can just be looking around I'm like I
[37:05] should be paying attention and trying to
[37:06] write down notes but
[37:09] um
[37:10] but
[37:12] um
[37:13] then I really got down to it I'm like
[37:15] Lord You're Gonna to help me it's like I
[37:17] want to get something out of camp
[37:19] and probably one probably one of the
[37:21] deepest desires I had was just
[37:24] to
[37:25] get a refilling of the Holy Spirit and I
[37:27] believe that happened for me so
[37:30] so really excited about that

[37:53] go to Louisiana
[37:55] um and someone just kind of um opened up
[37:59] their heart to kind of pay for me to go
[38:00] there so
[38:02] um so I knew God kind of wanted me to be
[38:04] there even though I didn't intend to
[38:06] originally and um all the services were
[38:09] just so powerful the word and especially
[38:12] Saturday night I think what Naomi was
[38:15] saying was truly special and seeing
[38:16] people just get healed and delivered
[38:20] um and even for me just um I was just
[38:22] truly Desiring to have a refilling of
[38:24] the Holy Spirit and God met me where I

[38:59] back and it really bothered me

[44:42] remember the king of England uh when he
[44:45] went to visit Canada
[44:48] and going through Vancouver and and all
[44:50] of the schools had let out and and uh
[44:53] they were having a uh a prayed as he was
[44:56] as he was coming through the streets and
[44:58] the teachers had given the the students
[45:00] Flags to wave and and the little kids
[45:03] were just a waving and screaming out God
[45:06] Save the King you know and and and uh
[45:09] but after the king had passed and and
[45:12] all of the kids had all dispersed the
[45:14] crowd of dispersed with one teacher had
[45:16] had missed uh uh you know they were
[45:19] missing a little girl and and so she
[45:21] goes back out and she's trying
[45:22] frantically looking for her and and and
[45:25] there she is with her with her head up
[45:27] against a telephone pole and she's
[45:29] crying and and and she said what what
[45:32] are you crying for and uh she said
[45:35] what's wrong did did you not get to see
[45:38] the king and the little girl says yeah I
[45:41] I saw the king she said did you did you
[45:44] wave your flag yeah I was my flag that
[45:49] then why are you crying and the little
[45:52] girl says because the king didn't see me
[45:57] the king didn't see me and I I I I that
[46:00] that is something that is that is that
[46:02] is incredible because there are many
[46:04] people who are going to church tonight
[46:05] there are many people who are following
[46:07] Christ for many different reasons
[46:09] there's amen they follow they followed
[46:12] him for uh you know that there were
[46:14] Skeptics there to find fault there were
[46:16] uh Smitty that were simply curious as to
[46:19] what is going on there are some that
[46:20] come to church that that that are just
[46:23] here uh maybe for the music or for the
[46:25] youth program or for him you know there
[46:27] there's the multitudes are innumerable
[46:30] of of people who are who are are are are
[46:34] are searching after Christ
[46:37] amen but there is a desire for the elect
[46:40] not just to come into His presence but
[46:43] we want to catch his attention amen I
[46:47] want to come to church to catch his
[46:49] attention amen I think that's that's
[46:51] that's do what that you know it doesn't
[46:53] matter what we hear it doesn't matter
[46:55] the sermons we we hear or the amen the
[46:58] music we hear or the people that we rub
[47:00] the shoulders with but what matters is I
[47:04] must have his attention friends I don't
[47:07] want to leave the church tonight and not
[47:09] have the attention of the Lord can you
[47:11] say man there's many that are that are
[47:13] amen desire the kingdom the multitudes
[47:17] are outreaching for the supernatural
[47:19] just as they throng Jesus but the elect
[47:22] is looking for something that is of
[47:25] Great Value amen and and the scripture
[47:29] says there in in Matthew 11 and 12 Jesus
[47:34] said from the days of John the Baptist
[47:36] until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers
[47:40] violence and the violent take it by
[47:42] force amen so this is something that is
[47:45] telling me you can be in his presence
[47:48] and not have his attention you can come
[47:51] to church and just be dull and numb and
[47:54] whatever but there's going to be
[47:56] somebody who is going to reach out after
[47:59] Christ and get his attention come on can
[48:03] you say Amen now coming in contact with
[48:06] God there's a difference between being
[48:08] Amen in his presence and and and and and
[48:11] and and coming in contact with him there
[48:14] were thousands present when the when the
[48:17] woman with the issue of blood was there
[48:19] amen and and the day that she was healed
[48:22] but the scripture says that the woman
[48:25] had to pass through the crowd in order
[48:29] to get there I wonder tonight how many's
[48:32] got that desire Amen to press through
[48:35] whatever to get there into the presence
[48:37] of the Lord now listen just to come to
[48:40] church and mine and just to sing the
[48:42] songs and knowing that he's in our midst
[48:44] because the scripture says he's in our
[48:46] midst that's not exactly amen of what
[48:49] I'm interested in I want to feel his
[48:52] touch upon my life I want to know that
[48:55] his presence is with me I've got to know
[48:58] a man that when he touches me because
[49:00] when the supernatural touches you
[49:02] something is going to happen when the
[49:04] supernatural touches you amen there is
[49:07] nothing that will ever be the same well
[49:09] can you say amen amen and I want to tell

[49:59] them and you try to open the beak and
[50:01] you you do everything they're not going

[52:36] continual knocking
[52:40] because of his importunity because he
[52:44] would not quit knocking he kept born
[52:48] banging he kept on asking he kept on
[52:52] doing it until the man got up and gave
[52:56] him what his desire was what can you say

[1:07:45] is it easy no it's not easy but I'm here
[1:07:49] to tell you there's a powerful River
[1:07:51] coming out of me and Satan I've been
[1:07:55] ordained and anointed to blow every damn
[1:07:58] up I've been ordained and anointed to
[1:08:02] rise above it I've got something
[1:08:04] powerful in me
[1:08:08] can you see man
[1:08:10] the secret believer Jairus
[1:08:13] now he had been a secret believer for a
[1:08:15] long time
[1:08:16] man he loved Jesus
[1:08:20] and he would always the one in the
[1:08:22] outskirts
[1:08:23] any man in the shadows
[1:08:25] hiding behind
[1:08:27] the trees are
[1:08:29] man as he's coming down the streets he
[1:08:32] would hide behind the little the little
[1:08:35] bushes and hear Jesus preaching and see
[1:08:37] the Miracles
[1:08:39] but you see Jesus was going to allow he
[1:08:42] was going to push the issue
[1:08:44] Jesus was going now remember Jesus is
[1:08:46] the one who's just told us
[1:08:48] you've got to be you've got to have
[1:08:51] opportunity you've got to be willing
[1:08:53] Jesus is saying if you want an answer
[1:08:55] for me
[1:08:57] you're going to have to press
[1:08:59] you're going to have to knock you're
[1:09:01] going to have to seek
[1:09:02] and here's an example here's Jarius
[1:09:06] but what happened
[1:09:08] God allowed he began to take the little
[1:09:11] the Downing out of the nest so to speak
[1:09:13] and when Jairus daughter got sick
[1:09:17] and all the doctors had done everything
[1:09:19] they could do
[1:09:23] Jarius was no longer a secret believer
[1:09:26] brother Branham says he picked up his
[1:09:28] hat he went out the door put his hat on
[1:09:32] and he'd come to Jesus
[1:09:35] and after a while
[1:09:38] he couldn't just sit on the outskirts he
[1:09:40] was in his presence but that wasn't good
[1:09:42] enough
[1:09:42] he had to get his attention
[1:09:46] before you know it he's no longer just
[1:09:48] sitting out there under a tree he's not
[1:09:51] out there looking with binoculars
[1:09:53] but now he's at the feet of Jesus
[1:09:56] now he's at the feet of Jesus and you
[1:09:58] know what happened
[1:10:01] Jesus says I'll come
[1:10:03] I'll come
[1:10:05] when you get his attention
[1:10:08] when you press through the the
[1:10:11] resistance when you're willing to push
[1:10:15] through it you're going to get an answer
[1:10:19] and I want to tell you the scripture
[1:10:20] says that he'll turn no man down
[1:10:23] praise the Lord
[1:10:25] but now watch watch
[1:10:28] whenever they was on his way he when he
[1:10:30] was on his way to their house that's
[1:10:32] when this woman with the issue of blood
[1:10:36] was coming through
[1:10:39] that Jesus is on his way to Jairus
[1:10:46] Jesus has just told this man I'm going
[1:10:48] with you
[1:10:50] and here comes the woman with the issue
[1:10:52] of blood
[1:10:54] and she's got to stop Jesus
[1:10:59] before he gets to Jairus house
[1:11:02] and what does he do he doesn't even she
[1:11:04] doesn't even stand in front of him Amen
[1:11:06] brother brother brother uh uh Harry gave
[1:11:09] us the a little bit of history behind
[1:11:11] her being unclean
[1:11:13] and and he she touched the Hem of His
[1:11:16] Garment
[1:11:19] but there was something about that press
[1:11:22] the scripture says she passed
[1:11:25] she pushed
[1:11:27] and when she'd done it she touched
[1:11:31] the Throne of God
[1:11:33] can you say man
[1:11:35] amen amen the scripture says
[1:11:39] and she came in the press behind
[1:11:41] and touched His Garment
[1:11:44] for she said if I made touch but his
[1:11:46] clothes I shall be whole
[1:11:48] and straightway the Fountain of her
[1:11:50] blood was dried up she felt in her body
[1:11:53] that she was healed of that plague
[1:11:55] and Jesus immediately knowing in himself
[1:11:57] that virtue had gone out of him he
[1:12:00] turned him about in the press in the
[1:12:01] crowd the throngs
[1:12:03] and he said who touched me and his
[1:12:04] disciples says Thou seeest the multitude
[1:12:07] thronging thee and sayeth thou who
[1:12:09] touched me
[1:12:11] I'm about to see her that had done the
[1:12:13] thing
[1:12:15] can you imagine as you're hearing
[1:12:17] brother Branham on the tapes and brother
[1:12:19] Branham stops he's he's here he's here
[1:12:21] with this with this man and he's
[1:12:22] Discerning and then all of a sudden he
[1:12:24] stops and he's and you don't hear it you
[1:12:26] don't see it but he's looking through
[1:12:27] the crown
[1:12:28] he's watching that Pillar of Fire and
[1:12:30] then he says you out there right right
[1:12:32] here behind this woman here and right
[1:12:35] it's somebody that intercepted the
[1:12:38] message to this one well glory to God
[1:12:41] I may be preaching to someone else right
[1:12:43] now and maybe you're thinking man this
[1:12:45] message ain't even for me yet but I'm
[1:12:46] here to tell you your faith can turn God
[1:12:49] your way
[1:12:52] come on now it's desire it's desire it's
[1:12:57] the willingness to press toward the
[1:13:01] prize
[1:13:03] can you say man now he said he looked
[1:13:06] about to see her that had done this
[1:13:07] thing but the woman fearing and
[1:13:09] trembling knowing what was done in here
[1:13:11] came and fell down before him and told
[1:13:13] him all the truth and he said unto her
[1:13:16] daughter thy faith hath made thee whole
[1:13:20] go in peace and behold of thy plague

[1:16:13] had heard of the miracle working power
[1:16:15] of Jesus
[1:16:17] and they took their friends to Jesus and

[1:16:22] but they had already heard what Jesus
[1:16:25] had been doing

[1:16:41] attention of Jesus you're going to do
[1:16:44] what it takes and I can just only
[1:16:45] imagine they got the attention of Jesus
[1:16:49] as the roof is coming off piece by piece
[1:16:52] and he's up there and all the stuff has
[1:16:54] fallen down as he's trying to preach a
[1:16:56] sermon amen and and he's looking up at
[1:16:59] them with this gaping hole in the roof
[1:17:01] Hallelujah and they weren't just I
[1:17:04] listened they got his attention but then
[1:17:06] they took ropes and they dropped him
[1:17:07] right down in front of his pulpit
[1:17:11] Hallelujah they brought him right down
[1:17:14] in front hey when you can't do it you've
[1:17:16] got to do whatever it takes friends

[1:17:36] many of them were many were gathered
[1:17:38] together in so much there was no room to
[1:17:40] receive them no not so much is about the
[1:17:42] door he preached the word unto them and
[1:17:44] they come unto him bringing this one
[1:17:46] sick of palsy which was born
[1:17:49] uh born a four amen and carried by four
[1:17:52] and when they could not come nigh unto
[1:17:55] him for the press the multitudes they
[1:17:57] uncovered the roof where he was and when
[1:17:59] they had broken it up they let him let
[1:18:02] down the bed we're in the sick of palsy
[1:18:04] lay and when Jesus saw their faith he
[1:18:07] said unto the sick of palsy son thy sins
[1:18:10] be forgiven thee
[1:18:12] I I you can I can I just tell you
[1:18:14] something here tonight struggle is a
[1:18:17] healthy part of your life
[1:18:20] a a man that don't have to struggle a
[1:18:23] girl that don't have to struggle
[1:18:25] if he's got all the money in the world
[1:18:26] why is it why is it uh uh that that that
[1:18:30] these guys that have uh you know when
[1:18:33] these Powerball things and and and and
[1:18:36] they've got like 20 million dollars or
[1:18:38] 20 billion dollars and and then before
[1:18:40] you know it within 10 years it's all
[1:18:43] gone they didn't work for it they didn't
[1:18:45] struggle for it it was given to them and
[1:18:47] so they're now living in yachts and this
[1:18:49] and that and the other things can you
[1:18:51] say Amen but a man that struggles for it
[1:18:53] amen he's he's not going to just blow it
[1:18:57] right
[1:18:58] come on now now we're we're in that
[1:19:01] Society where everyone wants everything
[1:19:03] for free and and but the struggle is a
[1:19:07] healthy part of your life
[1:19:10] y'all remember y'all remember my little
[1:19:12] butterfly story
[1:19:14] that the little butterfly
[1:19:16] was in that cocoon
[1:19:19] and and that cocoon was just wobbling
[1:19:21] around everywhere and and we could see
[1:19:23] the little head sticking out of the
[1:19:25] Cocoon
[1:19:27] and and and he's struggling and he's
[1:19:30] struggling in here and I thought my
[1:19:31] goodness so what we've done is we went
[1:19:34] and took the little cocoon down and we
[1:19:36] said amen we'll help you out
[1:19:40] so we go in there and we slit the Cocoon
[1:19:43] and out comes this wrinkled up butterfly
[1:19:45] and he just plops down
[1:19:47] and after a while when the wings begin
[1:19:50] to unfold a little bit amen but did you
[1:19:52] know that butterfly never did fly
[1:19:55] he never did fly it took the struggle of
[1:19:59] the Cocoon to build the muscle in his
[1:20:02] wings
[1:20:03] the little thing could never fly what I
[1:20:06] done what I done was took away the power
[1:20:11] to fly when I took away the resistance
[1:20:16] from his life
[1:20:18] and when you take away the reason why
[1:20:22] Christian why is things much worse now
[1:20:25] that I'm a Christian
[1:20:27] resistance pushes you closer to God
[1:20:30] resistance builds your faith muscles
[1:20:34] resistance gives you that Soul a
[1:20:37] determination Against All Odds
[1:20:40] can you say Amen

[1:22:40] pressing against the darkness one has to
[1:22:43] give way all the creeping things has
[1:22:45] been running through the night when the

[1:22:52] cannot exist at the same time in the
[1:22:55] same building it's either dark or it's
[1:22:57] light and light is so much more powerful
[1:23:00] than darkness and so is Christ
[1:23:04] so much more powerful than all the evil
[1:23:07] that's in the world and we're taught the
[1:23:09] science as the light begins to come in
[1:23:11] it condenses the darkness and the
[1:23:13] Darkness gathers all of its holes as
[1:23:15] hosts together to fight against the
[1:23:17] light but the light prevails and comes
[1:23:21] on
[1:23:23] amen good morning good morning it's no

[1:26:56] thought it was good so amen uh
[1:26:59] in brother Brands telling the story he
[1:27:02] said a young man there who was thrown
[1:27:04] out of a wreck just recently had a piece

[1:27:08] side sweeping through him and stuck out
[1:27:10] his his side like that and a dear
[1:27:13] Praying Mother and God spared him for
[1:27:16] some purpose and since she told me I

[1:27:22] the hall and he shook my hand I said
[1:27:25] aren't you the boy he said yes sir
[1:27:27] and he said I've got a call to them I
[1:27:29] said call a call to the ministry
[1:27:32] amen God be merciful now my dear
[1:27:35] brethren
[1:27:36] it's the young man sitting there with a
[1:27:38] brown coat on may God grant that he'll
[1:27:41] become a flaming light
[1:27:43] while we're on at the junction of the
[1:27:45] road sign and the preach the gospel

[1:27:58] out of you
[1:28:00] now brother Branham is alluding to the
[1:28:03] man the boy Satan tried to kill him
[1:28:07] and he's saying God be merciful
[1:28:10] God make a preacher out of you and God
[1:28:12] you in other words Satan you've done the
[1:28:16] wrong thing there's something that is
[1:28:18] going to rise out of this boy can you
[1:28:21] say Amen
[1:28:22] amen
[1:28:23] tension
[1:28:25] is never to keep you out of contact with
[1:28:28] God
[1:28:29] tension
[1:28:32] and resistance is to push you to God
[1:28:36] amen now it brings how contingent what
[1:28:41] do you mean brother window
[1:28:43] the tension that is in your life that
[1:28:46] you that that that that that accumulates
[1:28:48] in your spirit man on the soul
[1:28:51] it causes you to get desperate before
[1:28:55] God
[1:28:58] brings about acknowledgment I
[1:29:01] fight this
[1:29:03] on my own
[1:29:05] can you say man
[1:29:06] if there was no pain or anxieties here
[1:29:10] on the earth you wouldn't desire eternal
[1:29:13] life
[1:29:15] if there was no pain and anxieties in
[1:29:19] your marriage well praise the Lord if
[1:29:22] there was no church problems that come
[1:29:25] along if there was no a friction on the
[1:29:28] job site we'd live in a Utopia
[1:29:36] we wouldn't have a desire to go home we
[1:29:39] wouldn't have a desire well praise the
[1:29:41] Lord
[1:29:41] but because there is sickness and
[1:29:43] because there is pain and because the
[1:29:47] devil you know as a sickness does come
[1:29:49] and death does come and turmoil does
[1:29:52] come and these things do come what does
[1:29:54] it do
[1:29:55] it creates desire to get out of this
[1:30:01] bust house
[1:30:04] it creates desire to get it right
[1:30:11] okay
[1:30:13] when I broke my back
[1:30:16] when they had put my put me back
[1:30:18] together
[1:30:20] they had pinched a nerve
[1:30:22] that was going down my leg
[1:30:25] and and would go down right down the
[1:30:27] inside of my leg and it was so painful
[1:30:30] and and so when I came out of the
[1:30:33] surgery
[1:30:34] um it I I I was I was almost bowed over
[1:30:37] crying
[1:30:39] and they would give the medication
[1:30:42] so when I got home
[1:30:45] you know within a a couple of you know I
[1:30:49] was there for two weeks took them ten
[1:30:51] and a half hours to put me all back
[1:30:52] together and then then it took and then
[1:30:54] I was in there for two weeks and I get
[1:30:55] out and and I'm saying man something's
[1:30:58] wrong
[1:31:00] so when they go back and they examine
[1:31:02] they say well
[1:31:03] when we put you back together we've hit
[1:31:04] a nerve somewhere
[1:31:06] and so they said what we're going to do
[1:31:08] is we're going to deaden that nerve
[1:31:11] and so I said well what does that mean I
[1:31:13] don't like any kind of death been
[1:31:15] associated with my body is well you like
[1:31:17] this it's going to kill the pain amen
[1:31:20] and so they they came up with this real
[1:31:23] long shot
[1:31:24] and and and they they gave it to me and
[1:31:26] they done it a couple times uh over the
[1:31:28] next couple days
[1:31:30] and um
[1:31:32] it killed the pain totally killed the
[1:31:34] pain
[1:31:35] now
[1:31:37] every now and then when I'm walking
[1:31:38] it'll I'll get a faint I'll get a faint
[1:31:41] hurt a faint something in that leg
[1:31:45] um and and it just goes and it goes up
[1:31:47] into my stomach
[1:31:48] but they said your brain you're still
[1:31:51] hurting
[1:31:53] you're still hurting
[1:31:54] but your brain don't know it
[1:31:57] we have deadened the nerve
[1:31:59] and the brain don't know it
[1:32:01] and so I came back after we was trying
[1:32:03] six months later I come back and I'm man
[1:32:06] I'm hurting with my back and I'm wanting
[1:32:08] to go to work and I said
[1:32:10] I want to talk to y'all
[1:32:12] and I said
[1:32:15] you know that thingy you've done to my
[1:32:16] leg
[1:32:18] won't you do that to my back
[1:32:20] I said this pain that I'm in and this
[1:32:23] that I'm going through would you I just
[1:32:25] deaden that and I said can you do it and
[1:32:29] they said oh yeah we could do we could
[1:32:30] do it
[1:32:32] but they said we're not going
[1:32:35] doing it and I said why
[1:32:37] they said because you would not feel any
[1:32:39] pain
[1:32:40] and I said that's why I'm here
[1:32:44] and they said if there was no pain there
[1:32:48] would be no resistance to tell you
[1:32:53] pull back
[1:32:55] right
[1:32:57] now here I they said but because of the
[1:33:00] pain
[1:33:01] then you crippled back to the truck and
[1:33:03] you go sit down because you're not
[1:33:05] supposed to be out on the job site
[1:33:07] but if we were to do this now you would
[1:33:09] feel like bionic man man would just get
[1:33:12] out there and work as hard as you've
[1:33:13] ever done and you would break your back
[1:33:15] and never know it
[1:33:19] oh
[1:33:21] right
[1:33:22] so the pet God does not take away the
[1:33:27] pain
[1:33:30] just because you get saved does not mean
[1:33:33] all of the stress all of the pain all of
[1:33:37] the turmoil is over
[1:33:44] but it gives you a reason
[1:33:47] to press on
[1:33:49] to that Immortal man
[1:33:52] brother random says speaking of tension
[1:33:54] I was praying about it this morning
[1:33:57] what what would you do if you didn't
[1:34:00] have the tension think of it
[1:34:02] tension is part of living
[1:34:04] that kind of encouraged me when I
[1:34:06] thought of that
[1:34:08] he says
[1:34:10] if you had no tension
[1:34:12] you'd be like a red dog
[1:34:14] you wouldn't have no feelings there'd be
[1:34:16] nothing you you could work on like a
[1:34:19] husband and wife maybe if she wants to
[1:34:21] do something
[1:34:23] and they're trying to work together
[1:34:24] especially Christians and they're the
[1:34:25] ones the other one once and then when
[1:34:27] when you come together
[1:34:29] you find that she wants what she wants
[1:34:31] done and she finds out and attention
[1:34:33] really brings it begins to bring you
[1:34:35] closer together
[1:34:36] somebody tells you well just think the
[1:34:40] little wife that went under a lot of
[1:34:41] attention when you wasn't so good or the
[1:34:44] husband went uh went under some tension
[1:34:46] when you wasn't so good
[1:34:48] and when it's all forgiven how you feel
[1:34:51] about him oh my you've got to have
[1:34:56] tension that's all
[1:35:00] so just think of feelings what if you
[1:35:04] didn't have any feelings no pain no
[1:35:07] nothing if there was no pain at all
[1:35:09] you'd not have no feelings at all
[1:35:12] and if you had no feeling then one of
[1:35:14] your senses would be gone everything's
[1:35:17] just right anyhow
[1:35:19] but so God just gives us Grace to stand
[1:35:22] up to it that's the thing if I just
[1:35:26] stand up with that Grace and stand there
[1:35:30] and say we know that when this life is
[1:35:34] over
[1:35:35] the great ones on the other side where
[1:35:38] we're looking to go
[1:35:40] when it's over here I've got something
[1:35:44] over there
[1:35:46] he says somebody tries some people try
[1:35:48] to introduce Christianity that you're
[1:35:50] free from worry no you're not that
[1:35:53] you're free from tension oh no
[1:35:55] you add tension when you become a
[1:35:59] Christian
[1:36:00] because you was a kind of a sloppy go
[1:36:04] happy go lucky whatever it was out there
[1:36:07] not caring what you did
[1:36:10] but when you become a real Christian
[1:36:12] every moment you're wondering am I
[1:36:15] pleasing my Lord
[1:36:17] if I could hear from him
[1:36:19] it puts you on tensions put you on guard
[1:36:23] that's what makes you what you are
[1:36:26] someone say hallelujah so after all
[1:36:29] tension is a blessing it's just the way
[1:36:33] you're looking at it it's just the way
[1:36:34] you're looking at it see if you would
[1:36:36] look like on the other side see no
[1:36:39] matter how thin you slice it you've got
[1:36:41] two slides slices to it you see
[1:36:44] so you want to see both sides so tension
[1:36:47] oh my what's this tension if I could be
[1:36:51] born without tension well if I didn't
[1:36:54] have tension I wouldn't have been what I
[1:36:56] am I wouldn't have been a Christian

[1:39:27] Jacob needed a change so he had to
[1:39:29] wrestle with God all night long Moses
[1:39:31] had to have a change so he had to come
[1:39:33] to that that fiery Bush amen there David
[1:39:36] had to press until he got amen until he
[1:39:39] fought through all the obstacles to the

[1:40:37] want his attention in our lives
[1:40:43] brother or Jesus
[1:40:45] his entire Ministry was full attention
[1:40:47] his entire life was full of tension

[1:40:52] from birth
[1:40:53] Jesus was was done wrong all the way
[1:40:56] from birth can you say Amen

[1:41:33] that's that's all I I am here as the
[1:41:36] prophet said
[1:41:37] we have been put here to show the devil
[1:41:42] God allowed the whole situation to eat
[1:41:44] into Falls and for the devil to rise up
[1:41:47] his Eden
[1:41:49] so that God will show the power of his
[1:41:52] sons

[1:42:20] you ain't got enough Satan
[1:42:22] the pressures come God's allowed the
[1:42:24] fall
[1:42:26] the reason he's allowed to fall is to

[1:43:27] or declare manifest his salvation
[1:43:30] exhibit his salvation from day to day
[1:43:32] declare his glory
[1:43:35] among the Heathen the Sinners and his
[1:43:38] wonders among all people
[1:43:41] for the Lord is great and greatly to be
[1:43:43] praised he has to be feared above all
[1:43:45] the gods
[1:43:47] for all the gods of the nations are

[1:44:19] and fear before him
[1:44:22] all the Earth
[1:44:25] can you say Amen
[1:44:26] I'm going to sing a new song I'm going
[1:44:29] to let the
[1:44:30] Iman the High Praise has come
[1:44:34] from this vessel
[1:44:37] I'm going to
[1:44:41] want to push past the resistance
[1:44:45] I I thank God that the that these Psalms
[1:44:47] were put in there because it gives you
[1:44:50] it it it it gives you the backside of
[1:44:53] the story
[1:44:54] it's wonderful to hear about David
[1:44:56] killing bears and lions and and goliaths
[1:44:59] and being the great king but God let us
[1:45:03] see
[1:45:04] struggles
[1:45:07] God let him pin that
[1:45:09] so that every one of you who is who are
[1:45:12] seeking after the heart of God every one
[1:45:15] of you who are after God's very own
[1:45:17] heart
[1:45:20] can understand it was the resistance
[1:45:22] that took him and made him great
[1:45:25] it's the resistance
[1:45:29] am I just repeating myself tonight it's
[1:45:31] that it's it's that part of you
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:39] or if I could just get a better job or
[1:45:40] if I could just get a different disc or
[1:45:42] if I can just get a different that
[1:45:43] you're not going to get away from the
[1:45:44] spirit of laodicea the pressure is here
[1:45:49] well if I can get a different church if
[1:45:50] I
[1:45:51] if I'd make different friends well if I
[1:45:53] get a different
[1:45:55] You're Still Human
[1:45:57] and wherever you go
[1:45:59] your human goes
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:04] amen
[1:46:06] [Music]
[1:46:09] but the but the but but the deal is
[1:46:11] there's got to be a press
[1:46:14] don't succumb to this flesh don't
[1:46:16] succumb to your your spirit man
[1:46:21] press
[1:46:23] and that's the reason it's it's a listen
[1:46:25] the reason why the church is powerless
[1:46:28] today is because the church don't pray
[1:46:30] today
[1:46:34] prayer is hard
[1:46:37] but as I was saying Sunday night
[1:46:40] catch this
[1:46:42] he don't come down from the heavens
[1:46:46] until you go up to the heavens
[1:46:49] brother Branham says when the bride
[1:46:52] takes her position
[1:46:54] Satan loses his position
[1:46:58] laughs
[1:46:59] and then the next verse
[1:47:02] they overcome
[1:47:04] the blood of a lamb
[1:47:07] and the witness
[1:47:09] of their mouth
[1:47:11] the word of their testimony
[1:47:14] can you say man
[1:47:16] Hallelujah so this means there's a
[1:47:19] Warfare it's an all-out Warfare it's an
[1:47:21] all-out Warfare but I just say press
[1:47:24] if y'all heard that yet tonight press
[1:47:25] press
[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:31] if you go let's go go read and any of
[1:47:34] the scholars you can just do you a
[1:47:35] little bit of a review online and just
[1:47:37] see all of the Great Men of the Bible or
[1:47:40] or of Christianity
[1:47:41] throughout all of these ages
[1:47:45] and every one of the Great Men whether
[1:47:46] it's whether it's whether it's a
[1:47:49] Wycliffe or whether it's David
[1:47:52] Livingston or uh uh uh all of these uh
[1:47:56] Dr Bernard all of these great men who
[1:47:59] influenced the world throughout the ages
[1:48:04] they all had something in Peculiar
[1:48:07] are you all ready for this they all said
[1:48:09] about the same thing and these guys
[1:48:10] lived hundreds of years apart
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:13] that they found God more precious
[1:48:17] lots of them said between
[1:48:19] four o'clock and eight o'clock they
[1:48:21] would get up and start prayer at four
[1:48:23] o'clock
[1:48:24] until eight o'clock and then they would
[1:48:26] go to their activities
[1:48:27] many would do it from four o'clock to
[1:48:30] six o'clock
[1:48:32] but the but but but the strongest
[1:48:34] majority of them
[1:48:36] would do it around five or six o'clock
[1:48:38] in the morning they said there's and
[1:48:39] it's and it's exactly the way brother
[1:48:40] Branham says those early morning hours
[1:48:43] is when the devils
[1:48:46] are going to bed they've been working
[1:48:48] all night
[1:48:49] the Dew is coming down
[1:48:52] presence of the Lord
[1:48:54] he says there's something special about
[1:48:56] those early morning prayer
[1:49:00] now I'm not saying it's uh that's not a
[1:49:01] Doctrine I'm just saying when you look
[1:49:03] in the Diaries of these men
[1:49:05] they all had something peculiar
[1:49:09] it was easier to pray
[1:49:14] in those early morning hours
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:17] the resistance as brother Brandon would
[1:49:20] say the Devils were going to bed they
[1:49:22] have made their Havoc throughout the
[1:49:24] night
[1:49:29] and I would say that some of my best
[1:49:31] prayers
[1:49:33] have been early of the morning
[1:49:36] I because you're more refreshed you
[1:49:38] haven't started your day
[1:49:40] your your mind's not all
[1:49:42] going yet right
[1:49:45] spending that special time with God
[1:49:49] there's a lot of vitals one
[1:49:52] prayer
[1:49:54] there's a lot of battles one in prayer
[1:49:58] I say
[1:50:00] as Elder Burris
[1:50:02] elder sister Burris would say I'm
[1:50:04] pressing on the upward way
[1:50:07] New Heights I'm gaining every day
[1:50:10] is that right
[1:50:13] we are not staying still we are not
[1:50:17] average laodiceans we are the Overcomers
[1:50:20] of laodicea we are those we're the
[1:50:25] brother Bradham would say you're a
[1:50:27] special class you're in a bright age
[1:50:29] you're in a situation you're still in
[1:50:31] laodicea but you're not part of the
[1:50:35] Judgment you're up higher and above it
[1:50:38] oh
[1:50:39] amen
[1:50:40] how do I press
[1:50:42] I need strength to press
[1:50:45] well the psalmist said
[1:50:47] if we're having a hard time in prayer
[1:50:48] what did he say
[1:50:50] I fasted
[1:50:53] and prayer returned
[1:50:56] unto my bosom
[1:50:58] so sometimes saying Lord
[1:51:02] fasting doesn't always have to be food
[1:51:05] it could be just
[1:51:07] putting that phone aside
[1:51:10] it could be
[1:51:12] it could be
[1:51:14] whatever's taking our time
[1:51:16] getting off that stinking Facebook
[1:51:20] getting off this and that
[1:51:23] getting along with God and say Lord
[1:51:26] let desire come back
[1:51:29] I won't desire to come back
[1:51:35] it's not the desires left it's not the
[1:51:37] desires left no no no no no no no you're
[1:51:39] an eternal being desire is there
[1:51:45] you may be in your little you may be in
[1:51:47] your little egg right now and God's just
[1:51:49] you're you're right on the verge of your
[1:51:51] miracle and you just need to keep on
[1:51:53] pecking
[1:51:55] now's not the time
[1:51:57] to be sitting inside the shell drinking
[1:51:59] lemonade
[1:52:00] saying the egg will crack when it wants
[1:52:02] to
[1:52:03] no you're ordained
[1:52:06] to crack the egg
[1:52:07] [Music]
[1:52:11] amen
[1:52:13] not just ordained but you're anointed
[1:52:16] for it
[1:52:20] I love him
