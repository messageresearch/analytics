24th chapter amen we've also got brother Benji and sister Destiny here with us from the church back home sure glad to have them here amen Luke 24 in verse 49 it's a very familiar reading uh Jesus here speaking he says' and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tear ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen T ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high in the book of 1 Timothy the 3r chapter 1 Timothy the 3r chapter I want to look there at just one verse in the 15th verse of 1 Timothy Chapter 3 The Bible here says but if I T long that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God Amen this is not just a building but it's a church and it's the Church of the Living God I love this the pillar and the ground of the truth the Church of the Living God is the pillar and the ground of the truth we ask Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning if I was to take a a title this morning for just a few moments I want to speak to you on this the powerful Church of the Living God Amen the powerful Church of the Living God I want to read a quote here or two quotations from the prophet of God 1957 what does it take to make a Christian Life he says now if the Church of the Living God which is the pillar of the truth isn't that's something the Church of the Living God is the pillar of the truth he said God intended this church to be a powerful Church a glorious Church a church that the whole world could look upon as a bride of Christ well expected and espoused and to live in such an atmosphere and conduct itself in such a way that God would be proud of this church to present it to Christ at the coming of the Lord it should live in that characteristic in the church and it should be living that way amen God intended for his church amen to be a powerful Church to be a glorious church amen to be a church that would actually be the living display of his characteristic enticing Spirits 1955 he says I am positive sure this morning if men and women could only get into the position of where their soul and their thinking and their attitudes would be perfect in the sight of God that would be one of the most powerful churches that ever existed if we could only get our soul our thinking and our attitudes Amen in the perfect sight of God he says that would be one of the most powerful churches amen that ever existed now as you look here in Luke 24 and 49 if I could read just a few translation amen there in the Amplified Bible it says listen carefully I am sending the promise of my father amen the Holy Spirit upon you but you are to remain in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed amen fully equipped amen with power from on high in the emphatic diaglot it says behold I send forth the promise of my father upon you amen am men but remain you in the city amen till you are invested with power from on high amen so the Holy Ghost is going to dress the church amen but he's also going to invest in the church and what he's investing in the church amen is the power or the dunamis which is where we get the word Dynamite from look at this word power it is strength it is ability amen it is inherent power it is power residing in a thing amen by the virtue of its nature or which a person or a thing amen exerts and puts forth it is the power for performing Miracles amen it is the power of Excellence of Soul it is the power and influence which belongs to riches and wealth it is the power and resources arising from numbers amen it is the power consisting in amen or resting upon armies forces and host now I just have to say Amen what I believe about this powerful Church of the Living God I believe that we are the great Army that Joel saw Amen in the second chapter when he said there would be amen a a tearing down amen but then there would be a restoring back and the Bible said amen that God would restore by his power see what he says is behold I send amen the promise of my father upon you look at this word sin it means to send Amen in to order one amen to go to a place appointed that he might be in a state of liberty amen so the Holy Ghost is coming into the church amen under the direction of almighty God Amen not to bring the church into bondage amen but to bring the church into the Glorious Liberty amen wherewith we might be called the sons of God that's why the Bible said You shall amen receive power when after the Holy Ghost has come upon you listen if we know what the Holy Ghost is then we know what the Holy Ghost is not amen and I'll tell you this the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Jesus Christ in you brother R said the Holy Ghost is the power of God Amen that sent you into the heart as a witness of the spirit you have been born again your life is cleaned up the world is dead all the stink of it amen is like the garlic in Egypt see amen you're far away from it amen you are a new creature in Christ Jesus old things have passed away you become new all together a new creation amen you are born of the spirit you're whole members of your body submissive to his spirit and you are moving in the Holy Ghost and you are not listening to the sound of the world Amen your eyes are on Heavenly things listen the Holy Ghost amen is power from on high listen the Holy Ghost is not power from a bishop it's not power from a pope it's not power from a preacher the Holy Ghost is not a handshake the Holy Ghost is not a letter amen it's the gift of God with power amen from on high Amen to demonstrate to the people that God is not dead amen but he is alive and he is moving and he is breathing he said the holy spirit is an experence erience of being filled and endued with power for service am then so this power is not coming to Puff us up this power is not coming to build up our Ambitions of humanity this power is coming Amen to put us into the service of almighty God why are we here this morning we're not here to see who showed up we're not here to see who can out sing who we are here amen that the power of God might find a right away Amen in our hearts in our lives to manifest himself listen we are not here amen just under a church experience but we have a true experience amen by the true power he said the true word comes to the true prophet and he tells you the true word then you follow that true word and you get a true experience of the word because the word is made flesh in you and you have become God's son and the word of God is revolving right out of God into you because you are his nature his spirit is in you and you'll do the works of God listen friends I believe it I believe the Holy Ghost is more than just a feeling I believe the Holy Ghost is more than just an emotion or just a sensation or just a chill bump amen I believe the Holy Ghost is the person of God Amen that is coming this age Amen to empower people Amen to defeat every devil listen we are not the defeated folks we are not the overcome we are the Overcomers by the blood of the lamb and by the word of Our Testimony listen you say well I've been baptized amen but I've not received the Holy Ghost amen God is under obligation Amen to give every believer the Holy Ghost you believe God and say you believe God and haven't receive the holy spirit amen then there's something wrong with your faith see because he's more willing to give it to you amen then you are to receive it amen because God is under obligation Amen to keep his word I'll say this I believe amen that a repentance amen precedes a feeling of power the prophet of God said a man cannot lay in the presence of God a church cannot stay in the presence of God Amen under repentance unless the Holy Spirit comes down and gives an unction and a power amen to start a move of God in there among those people I'll just say this Satan hates amen when a preacher begins to preach on the possibilities after a repentance amen because he knows what can happen when a true repentance takes place do you know there were two men in the Bible amen that were sought to be killed amen it was Apostle John and it was or Apostle Paul rather Amen in John the Baptist do you know why that the devil was trying to kill those men is because they were preaching amen the possibility after a repentance and the devil knew if they repent then that's going to bring God on the scene and what I have held and what I have pounded and what I have Shackled is I'm going to lose my grip listen folks that's why the devil don't want you to repent that's why he don't want you to say I'm sorry or to forgive me amen or ask God to forgive you because he knows the minute that a true repentance amen takes place in the soul of the believer there is a possibility for a Revival there is a possibility for a miracle oh I say Satan you're too late we've already repented we've already repented of our sins we've repented of our iniquities amen we've asked God to forgive us now we're asking God to Endo us with power amen from on high amen for service amen there is a reason why Satan wants to stop a repentance is because my Bible said that God is not a man that he should lie and neither is he the son of man that he should repent he said when you thoroughly repent and believe on the Lord and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you make God a liar if you don't receive the Holy Ghost oh my amen if you are thoroughly repented and been baptized in his name and you don't receive the Holy Ghost you have made God a liar but my Bible says God is not a liar and neither is he the son of man that he should repent listen if you have made it right amen you say well I made this mistake and and I done this and I done that let me say this the moment that's underneath the blood amen God don't look at you the same anymore come on sister Bruce amen you're standing there and you don't know if you've had a birth you don't know if you've had an experience and a prophet is looking at you and he says now listen you're saying all these mistakes and all these problems he said but here's the problem amen is I'm not a sinner and neither are you oh church that ought to put make you put your joy shoes on that there is a blood and there is a water and there is a spirit that can change a man and make him a new creature in Christ Jesus listen this power this power I'm talking about this power belongs to God and has been invested into the church David says in Psalm 62:11 he said God has spoken twice amen twice have I heard this that power belongeth unto God in 1 Chronicles 29 and12 amen both riches and honor come of thee thou reignest over all and in thy hand is power and might in thy hand is to make great and to give strength unto all 2 Chronicles 258 but if I will go do it amen be strong for the battle amen for God shall make thee fall before the enemy for God ha power to help and he has power to cast down job 26:12 he divideth the sea with his power and by his understanding amen he smiteth though the proud Psalm 65 and6 which by his strength amen he Seth fast the mountains look here being girded with power listen the god that separated the Seas is the god that fastened the mountains he's the god that placed the Stars he's a God that placed the moon amen but that same God has come into your soul amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost what has he done he has come to guard you amen or to inquip you or to clothe you with power it's the father who takes care of it and who's got any more power than God so what kind of power have you got over you to take care of you have you ever wondered about that what kind of power have you got over you to take care of you brother Kobe he says the whole powers that created the universe my goodness amen the powers that created the universe is right here in this building this morning look what he said and pick up your pen and write the members of the Virgin bride will love him they will have his potentials for he is their head and all power belongs to him they are subject to him as the members of our body amen are subject amen now watch this are subject to our heads brother said now remember dear friends amen God's power is not to be made a show but God's power is to be displayed in his characteristic Hebrews chapter 1 verse one amen I'm trying to lay a foundation y'all's preaching me amen God who at sunnd times and divers man are spake in time pass unto the fathers by the prophets ha in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being in the brightness of his glory the expressed image of his person now watch this and upholding all things amen by the word of his power notice it doesn't say by the power of His word it says by the word of his power when he made him Purge their sin sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high brother BR picks this up and says the brightness of whose Glory God's glory the expressed image of whose presence God's see the word amen that upholds all things amen science tries to tear it down and say it's an old book it's been translated the Roman Catholic Church Bishop Sheen said it's been translated four or five different times and there's not much to it you couldn't live by it if you had to but he upholds all things by his word amen that's when I think about it I believe the Bible he said the word of his power now watch this there is power in his words he upholds all things by the word of his power amen but there are power in his words come on folks what power is in his words it's not the power of the Catholic pope it's not the power of the Pentecostal Bishop it's the power of the Holy Ghost and that same power is inside of every believer here this morning hey that's why the devil hatte you because no matter how low you go no matter how disappointed you become no matter how depressed the devil tries to depress you there is aware of this power on the inside of your soul and the minute you begin to believe that God is bigger and God is greater and God is stronger you'll put on your marching shoes like the children of Israel and you'll March around the walls of Jericho because the word of his power will bring the walls down yes sir tear the word down if you want to but it's already in the flesh of the Bride Glory what is it it's a Divine support Church we're not here by our own power we're not here by our own ability we are divinely supported by the power of Christ listen you're not a halfway equipped Church you are a fully equipped church can I remind you of something God don't call the equipped but he equips the called the prophet of God said so you stay there until God Eclipse you with the baptism of the spirit then everything you've got need of in this world or the world to come amen lives right in you woo brother so the god that that wrote the word is also the investor of the Divine revealer of that word in other words you are invested with power from on high in the in the reach 1963 he said tomorrow night by the grace of God we're going to try amen to break that first seal if God will break it for us and let us see what this Revelation has been hid from the foundation of the world so here a Prophet is going to Endeavor Amen to open the seals amen which is the word of God and by the opening of Seven Seals is going to reveal the mysteries of the Bible and it's going to bring a power into the church let me just show you something this is separating Amen brother Kobe it's separating a Pentecostal Revival from the brides's Revival Pentecost was getting their Revival from the music they were getting their Revival from the preachers they were getting a Revival from personalities but when the word begin to be open amen the word of his power begin to be revealed into the Flesh of the church that's why the devil can't stop you he can stop our music he can stop our singing he can control our feelings but he cannot stop this word he said heavens and earth shall pass away but my word amen shall never fail come on New Life Outreach this church has been here for years you've been through battles and wars and troubles and and issues and unbelief and people come and people going but you're still here and you're still standing because this is not a fleshly Revival it's not a musical Revival it is the word of this power Revival it is the revelation of Seven Seals it is the Thundering of seven Thunders it is the breaking of the bread of life and it has become your support my goodness before we do that Center friend or lukor church member do you just have a membership in a church and if you don't have a membership have you only a membership you'd be pretty well near near off better if you didn't have it see you need a birth you must come to the blood you must come to something that just spots the sin away till there's no more remembrance of it if you haven't made preparation yet to meet the lamb in the air are y'all ready for this first seal he's getting ready to preach it he's preaching the breach and he's praying and brother Josh he says if you haven't made preparation yet to meet the lamb in the air and by the power invested me by the power invested me by my commission given by almighty God and ministered to me by an Angel a pillar of light I charge you in the name of Jesus Christ don't you try to meet him with only a membership of a lodge or a church of this Earth you come while the mediator as far as I know is still on the throne making intercessions because there will come a day when you'll want to come there'll be no mediator for if we see the hour that we're living in the seventh Church Age The Mysteries of God have become what they have with the Vindicated spirit of God showing everything he promised in the last days how much more time is left now come on folks this is more than just a sermon he says by the power invested in me brother said like this by my commission and by the power invested in me how many's ever been to a wedding amen you've been to your own wedding hopefully a you've been to a wedding you ever notice there brother Miguel when the minister stands there and he says these words he says by the power vested in Me by the state of Oklahoma amen I now you husband and wife he's referring Amen to the illegal Authority that has come down upon this Union listen folks they're no longer Twain they're one Hallelujah they're no longer two they have now become one what made him one amen was by the power invested in that minister to lay an authority upon that Union let me say what a prophet said he said there is a marriage of the lamb and there is a marriage supper of the L listen folks we're not going to the marriage we're going to the marriage supper we are already married we are already married I can say what a prophet said when he preached this message he was preaching your wedding ceremony he was telling you that there is now a legal Authority there is now a power upon you oh glory to God there is now a union upon you listen you're no longer a distant King to God you have now been made one Hall woo brother there's a marriage taking place on Earth and there's a Rapture carrying us to the marriage supper and really folks there's only two powers in the universe brother said regardless of the difference he said there's only two Powers there's only two kingdoms listen there's God's power and there's Satan's power he said every war every disorder everything that comes along is either controlled by God's power or Satan's power see there is the power of life and there is the power of death he said now Satan his power that he's got is the perverted power of God the devil's power is the perverted power of God he said listen it isn't no real power it's only a perversion of God's power amen today sitting here you're either controlled by the power of God or you're controlled by the power of the devil and the devil's power is a perverted power but God promised in the last days that he would restore to the Church of the Living God the original Power he said I will restore sayith the Lord listen I'll send back another church glory to God I will send back another church in the last days I will restore that original Power again in the evening time it shall be light what are you saying I'm saying folks the original Power is the real power he said there's been much mockery in every phase of religion but there is a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the human being from bondage of sin there's a real power of the holy spirit that delivers the sufferer from his suffering amen can you preach with me say these words the holy ghost is real well say it again the Holy Ghost ghost is real there is a real Holy Ghost he said I'm so sick and tired of human philosophy I want to see the real power of God Amen demonstrate and moving among his people where that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he's proving himself listen that's what the world is hungering for the world is not hungering for fanaticism now I know when you start preaching about power and the move of God there's always that little scarecrow it says well there's always the danger of fanaticism and there's always the danger of wild fire let me just say this if you ain't got no fire at all you ain't got to worry about Wildfire I find it amazing brother Josh most of the people that's always getting on me about fire turning into Wildfire wouldn't know fire if they met it in a three acre field they ain't got no fire to worry about turning into Wildfire listen folks fanaticism only makes the real power of God shine brighter what is the real power amen the real power of the resurrected Christ amen is the real Pentecostal blessing the Pentecostal blessing amen is not you shouting and dancing the real Pentecostal blessing is the confirmation of the Resurrection that the Jesus that died is the Jesus that rose again and he's not in a tomb in Jeffersonville he's not in a grave in Jerusalem but he's right here this morning and he is robed in the flesh of his wife by the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes sir the world has the wrong understanding of power listen what a prophet says he says how could Satan throw amen how could Satan say that man could be God he's talking about Jesus hanging on the cross he says a man that could take the challenge of a priest and let a drunken Soldier spit in his face now come on Church he he he raised the dead brother he opened blinded eyes brother Merl he walked on the water he bid Peter to come walking to him and Peter walked as long as he kept his eyes on Jesus but the very second he took his eyes off of Jesus he be to sink and Jesus reached down his eternal hand and picked him up out of the water amen I'm talking about a man that fed 5,000 with just two fish and five loaves of bread I'm talk talking about a man that they ran out of wine at a wedding and he turned the water into wine but yet he could hang there on the cross and let a priest challenge him and let a drunken Soldier spit in his face he said church today we've got the wrong conception of power wouldn't power be amen challenging the priest back wouldn't power be amen amen correcting or zapping the life out of the soldier amen that spit in his face no here's what he says he said power is overcoming so power is overcoming he says it's returning good for evil that's the real power woo now we're going to preach aren't we the real power is not the power to speak squirrels into existence although we believe in that the real Display of Power is not the ability to walk on water the real Display of Power is not the ability to speak in tongues or Shout amen but the real display of the real power is the ability to overcome by returning good for evil that you can love your enemy and do good to those that do evil to you that's the real power that's God's power he said Maniacs can break chains but it takes a real man to return good for evil now watch this from his heart amen not because of a religious duty but from his heart now who are we talking about we're talking about Jesus Christ who hung upon the cross here's what he says in Luke 23:34 then said Jesus now here he is amen he's hanging on the cross they spit in his face the priest has challenged him amen they've driven a sword into his side there's a crown of thorns upon his head his butt his back is nothing but a bloody banket come on folks amen he's not looking like anything that is of any value or any of any worth but oh if they could only see who was hanging upon that cross it was more than a man it was the power of God on display in the flesh of Jesus he stands there and he cries these words brother Duran he says father get even with them Father give him a piece of your kingdom and let him know what it's like to be smitten he screams out these words father forgive them for they know not what they do look here and they parted his reignment and they cast lots now come on folks amen years several years ago I was studying on this and the Lord asked to give it to me amen who are we talking about here we're talking about the head of the church we're talking about the head of the Church of the Living God which is none other than our Lord Jesus Christ and the prophet said and pick up your pen and ride he said as the members of the body are subject to the head here is our head and he's displaying the real power of God In The Darkest Hour of his life let me say this the same power that manifested in the head is going to manifest in the body that's why the devil hates us is cuz we're not good at holding grudges come on folks we're not good at hiding our sins we're not good at trying to paint some kind of facade that we're better than somebody else we're a bunch of country folks that's been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ somebody say well brother Andrew why do you enjoy church so much because I enjoy it when I'm with people that I know about what do you mean amen when I know I'm with people that's just like me they were Sinners amen saved by the grace of God Amen somebody amen somebody might wonder say amen amen why do you why do you joke around with Miguel amen about fing his thumb up amen cuz we ain't no fancy some bodies we're just a bunch of Sinners amen saved by the grace of God we don't have no good church manners we're just happy to know that God loved us and he saved us and we're happy to be in the house of God and say why do you stand up and back the word cuz I didn't go to church etiquette I went to the upper room and I got filled with the power of God I just got to enjoy myself in the presence of God ain't got no fancy Church manners glory to God now watch this the same power that's manifest in the head is also manifested in the body said from this pulit spoke a mighty scientist not long ago they were questioning me back in the room about the light that Angelic light that appeared had it on paper on a picture he said Reverend brandom how they put a meter on a dying Saint now here's a lady dying and they put a meter on her and he said now watch when it when when she was dying they slipped off in a room and her knowing nothing about it he said and when her death struck her she wasn't afraid she lifted up her eyes and asked God now watch this she's on her deathbed Saints she's laying there dying they've got a meter hooked up to her and as she's dying now watch this she lifts up her eyes and asked God to forgive every enemy that she had she asked God to forgive every enemy she had now watch and she thanked him for the life that she had lived and when that meter was put on zero there was enough power raised from that woman it was Supernatural something that went from her that called on to that meter made have the same thing as a lie detector that's your nerves now watch this you wasn't made to tell lies come on folks amen what is she doing she is doing the same thing that her head done oh God she's doing the same thing that her head done when her head which is the Lord Jesus Christ tongue on the cross as he was dying and breathing his final breaths out of his final breaths come the words father forgive them for they know not what they do and here is a Christian who has got the same power in her that he had and when she's breathing her final breast she lifts her eyes up to God and says father forgive every enemy I've got father I thank you for the life I've lived oh can I tell you something that makes me want to shout amen that not even death can change the characteristic of Jesus Christ in a soul of The Believer by the baptism of the Holy Ghost father father forgive every enemy I've got let said a woman laying there enough power come from that woman to send a radio message around the world five times I believe it was of power coming off of that dying woman church I hope you see how powerful you are watch here go on beyond the moon the stars to the the Throne of God with that prayer to a sinner's poor heart in the hours of her death now watch this Infidel or this scientist brother brother Josh he leaves this Christian and goes over to this Infidel and he hooks the same meter upon this Infidel and he says now let's see what his reads he says now he was laying there dying with the veneral disease they sent a young lady in there to get him all emotionally worked up and then when he got angry with her he began to curse and take God's name in vain and the meter turned back as far as the other way as the Christian did this way so the Christian meter brother Caleb it went so far in the positive that you could send a radio message around the world five times but when it come to this Infidel and they hooked it up to him it sent it so far in the negative that it wouldn't even rais and the scientist now watch this and it's as far as he knows me the other way now can I just show you something amen amen I'm sorry I'm the guy I'm the guy that just keeps reading and reading and studying study until I find it and then Jesus hung there on the cross and whatever character he was displaying while he was hanging on the cross whatever character he was displaying was so powerful that it even influenced the Roman soldiers around him it was so powerful that they had to acknowledge this is more than a man up there he was so powerful are you with me he was so powerful that even in his death there were two thieves that were hanging on each side of him and one of them accepted him oh God woo Glory brother sister one of them accepted him in the moments of their death yes sir now come on church I got to I got to preaching this over in Poland the other day and I got to thinking about it amen 11th Hour workers tell me something Church brother Dylan what did that Thief do to make it to Paradise anybody he's hanging on a cross he can't go hold a prayer line he can't go cast out a devil he can't go speak a storm out of existance he can't go walk on the water he's hanging on the cross he's in his final breast but out of his breast he screams these words father remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom remember me and in his final moments come on church I know this is going to chop legalism to one end or the other but we might as well preach we here amen when he went into Paradise he began to walk around amen now watch this he has just breathed his last breath and Jesus says today thou will be with me in Paradise what did he do the only thing he did was accept what was being offered the only thing he did was accept what was being offered what was being offered a pardon in the final minutes of his life a deliverance from the Hell in the final minutes of his life and he said father and he said today thou will be with me in Paradise now I got a question for you okay I know we got some Bible scholars here and some preachers so y'all help me okay he went into paradise and the first person I'll say saw was Abraham and Sarah who are you well my name's Abraham no way you're the one that believed for a child when your body was as good as Dead who are you my name is Sarah you're the one that laughed at the angel of the Lord's visitation and he forgave you because you was connected you was connected to Abraham you're here he looks over at this one says what's your name he says my name shamgar oh you're the one that 600 Philistines was trying to destroy your crops and was stealing your heritage amen and you took an ox gold and you fought against 600 Philistines he looks at another one he says what's your name he said my name is Samson he said you're the one that got trouble but then you got to the pillars y'all remember you got to the pillars of the temple and you got a second chance and you killed more in your death than you did in your life he looks at another one and says what's your name he said my name is Jonah he said Jonah you're the one that went into Well's belly and was running from God but you ended up in Nineveh preaching the Penance brother sister he's going down the line and all of a sudden he's down the line and he's heard all these works these people's done and he here's knock on the door come on church he hears a knock on the door and he opens the door and it's the same one he was just hanging beside on the cross he says oh it's you amen come on I come to empty Paradise now come on Friends what works did he walk out on come on we're preaching what works did he walk out on did he walk out on how good of the church member he was but said he never even thought about God in his entire life what works did he walk out on did he slay a giant did he kill a he walked out on Grace woo Glory I'll shout by myself he walked out on Grace what are you saying I'm saying the real power of God was displayed in Sovereign Grace brother B said that scientist looked at me now I I got away from but I'm back at it he said that scientist looked at me and he was converted he was converted by that woman's experience on her deathbed he said now Reverend brandom I know you're not going to believe this he says but those lights around the Savior and around the Saints was not just some mental conception it was God back in the days like the brass serpent that's ially proven to be true he says but that's before they had a camera to take the picture are you ready for this he said that there was power around the believer what kind of power was around that believer it was the power of God it was the Dynamics and the mechanics listen I want to say this to you this morning the power of Satan is limited right brother brother Merl there are limitations on Satan's power but I want to say this the power of God is unlimited brother said way back before the foundation of the world when Satan perverted evil to good God being infinite look down to the stream of time and he saw the End by four knowledge if he don't know all things you have a limited God you've made him finite like you and I but God is unlimited come on church God is UN unlimited he said God's power God's knowledge everything he's the omnipotent what is that word limited it is restricted in size amount or to the extent it is not in great ability or talents but look at this word unlimited it is not limited or restricted in terms of number quality or rather quantity or extent having an infinite number of solutions oh I ought to make you shout amen God is unlimited which means he has a resource oh God which means he has a bank account of an infinite number of solutions glory to God you know why you're here is because the devil is limited he's done everything he can to take you out he's done everything he can to bind you under complexes under scares under inferiority ideas but God who has re and mercy is the unlimited God he has an infinite number of solutions Hallelujah that ought to make you raise your hands and praise God he has an infinite number of solutions what are you saying I'm saying Austin you never been in one trial buddy that God wondered how you was going to come out of it you've never been in one situation Kobe and God wondered how in the world he was going to get you out of it brother Donald you've never been in one situation that God didn't know how to get you out of you know why brother Miguel because he's the unlimited god brother Caleb he's the unlimited God hallelujah brother Mike he's the unlimited God when we've exhausted every resource and we don't know where to turn and we don't know where to go he comes walking on the water that's the unlimited God hallelujah I tell you this if he's the unlimited God and he's inside of you you're the unlimited church I felt that one if he's the unlimited God and he's on the inside of you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are the unlimited church if you can limit God you can limit Christ direct quote if you limit the church today in its possibilities you are limiting God come on folks I'm telling you New Life Outreach it's time to take the restrictions off of God it's time to take the limits off of God I'm going to tell you this it's time to take the limits off of your church I said it's time to take the limits off of your church devil didn't like that but I'll say it again it's time to take the limits off of your church I said it's time to take the limits off of your church I said it's time to take the limits off for your church I said it's time to take the limits off for your church I know the devil don't like it I'll say it again it's time to take the limits off of your church it's time to quit letting the devil tell you you've got as much as you can have you've gone as far as you can go you've seen as much as you can see I defy that devil in the name of Jesus Christ this is the powerful Church of the Living God and he's the unlimited God the unlimited God now I know I know we're living in the time of the Gentiles and it will be fulfilled and the prophet said shocking isn't it to know that we have a limited time okay can I say this to you the Gentiles limited time does not restrict the unlimited God but sometimes we limit God by time now Lord this should have done changed Lord have mercy we went from shouting to pouting Lord this should have already got better Lord this shouldn't still be going on but can I say this to you he said you try to limit God to your theology you try to limit God to your way of thinking so the way you think becomes a limit now come on folks the way you the your theology becomes limit I'm going go ahead and preach amen Pentecostal theology will put a lot of people in Hell come on well is this okay Josh and a Pentecostal theology will put a lot of people in Hell brother w correct me when you get home it'll put a lot of people in hell you know why cuz they don't give no Grace to nobody it's a bunch of legalism and a bunch of Works amen come on somebody say well amen Somebody went by Suicide they're they're lost forever come on folks come on let's just preach what about the grace of God you don't know what happened in the last few minutes can I just preach well well so and so lived this way for years and years and years I read a story the other day a very powerful story I don't know it was just a powerful story I'll share it with you there was a man who didn't send his wife to work on the 911 day some of you may have read it he didn't send his wife to work on 911 the tower that she would have been in was the tower that would have been crushed she would have died when he called when his father called his father said Son oh God his father said son he said is your wife at work he said no Dad she stayed home he said praise the Lord he said I got to go down there and do what I can to help free them people that man went in them Towers trying to deliver people you know what the story says the story says that his son thought dad oh no he can't do this what if he dies he's not saved what if he don't know Jesus he's not saved you can't go in there The Story Goes years later there was a young man that found him and said are you so and so he said yes he said I got to tell you a story he said your your father was in that Rubble trying to deliver my mom he said and they realized they were trapped and they weren't going to get out of that Tower he said and when they realized they were going to die he screamed out I'm not even saved and he said I've got a record that as your dad was trying to deliver my mom died she witnessed to him about Jesus Christ and he accepted Jesus Christ I say it's time to take the limits off of God he can do anything anywhere anytime under any conditions because he's God Miguel he's God god brother Kobe he's God on the mountain he's God in the valley brother he's God when I feel him brother Duran he's God when we don't he's the unlimited God it's time to take the restrictions off of him an unlimited God has sent to you an unlimited message to reveal an unlimited power which has produced an unlimited Revival well I'm just going to say it Satan you tried to kill the Revival this church and you failed Satan you tried but you failed Satan you tried but you failed because the unlimited God is in this church and he has an infinite number of solutions woo brother brother conquering that makes me want to shout the unlimited God an unlimited number what are you saying when we go beyond our own sound barrier into the word of God then it's unlimited what God can do with a man when you catch a vision of the unlimited power brother said what the church is lacking today is testifying of our great and powerful Jesus today we try to limit him and say well he was back Yonder but today he's the same that he was then and the church who's got the vision of this and knows it all not to be slack at any time but telling everywhere they go Jesus lives and Jesus Reigns and he's above all folks I'm sorry there's only two types of churches in the universe today brother said Jesus in his church today would be just as powerless as your faith is and just as powerful as your faith is you say what kind of churches are there there are powerless churches and there are powerful churches what's powerless without ability without influence or power what's powerful having great power strength in Matthew 13 the parable of the so in the seed I'm running out of time remember said look he said you're always pointing how Wicked the world's getting but you fail to see how powerful the church is getting at the same time she's rising up standing on the field oh she's little Fu but brother God's with her and she's going to Triumph just as certain as Christ rose from the dead can I say what a prophet said I I come to minister to your new life Outreach can I say what he said will you accept it how many members of the church here will accept it he said the church is going to Triumph through the blood of Jesus Christ to the victory march I say devil get out of our way I done got my marching shoes on I'm underneath the blood I've got a prophet's word I've got the Holy Ghost the word of his power has been invested in my soul devil I may look like a failure now but you're going to have to take a sideline and watch me March woo we're always complaining about the world and how Wicked the world is but you forget to realize how more powerful the church is than it used to be when the world is getting wickeder and wickeder and wickeder y'all believe a prophet the church is getting more powerful and Powerful all the time when the enemy comes in like a flood come on the spirit of God will raise a standard I'm feeling good folks we know that this is a separating time when the world will continue to grow worse but the church will become more concerned and your spirit will get greater and more powerful all the time in the church until Christ and the church unites together you say brother Andrew this is a this is a perilous time the spirit of Prophecy did say perilous time shall come you know what he said he said they'll deny the power of God he said I'll stand at the door and I'll knock If any man will open I'll come in and sck with him and he with me but said his word testifies in the last day there will come a falling away and the world would come up a cold formal powerless Church age did I read that right a cold formal powerless Church age but not bright age going to be a powerless Church age but there's a bride called out Glory he said the Book of Revelation shows that Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and would defile it making it lukewarm formal and Powerless and a Prophet come along and said God hates a powerless religion and any religion today that hasn't got Christ in it is powerless he said God wants to perform his word by his power by the Holy Ghost and the church wants to perform now watch this he said they deny the power and they bring in membership no matter what you have to baptize Sinners drunkards Bootleggers anything else and take them in to the body of CH of the church he said what they're doing is they are denying the power now now can I just preach here for a second you say deny of the power they're denying the dunamus to change the nature of the individual brother said people join churches and call that God salvation he said that's blasphemy he said there's a lot of difference between the blessings and power he said God makes his blessings upon the righteous and the unrighteous we got to go back to truth friends we got to come back to what God means what he says he means God wants to perform and bring forth the holy Spirit into operation in the church and the church wants to perform and bring forth its Creeds to make members let me let me let me let me say this to you but when I speak of this powerful Church of the Living God I'm speaking of the true church that according to scripture was divinely instituted by God in Matthew 16:18 Jesus says this I say also unto thee Thou Art Peter and upon on this rock somebody say Upon This Rock brother brother Josh what does he say I will build my church brother Miguel I will build my church I'm feeling good folks can I read the rest of it and the gates of hell the Gates of Hell shall not brother dur that's you better you've been reading it for years buddy shall not Prevail against it Jesus stands there and is making a claim you know what he's saying he's saying I will build my church look at this word build it means to build up from the foundation it means to restore by building Paul says you are built upon the foundation the apostles prophets look what he says in whom also the building fitly framed together growth un a holy Temple of the Lord in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit look at this word built it means to finish the structure of which the foundation has already been laid to give constant increase in Christian knowledge and in a life conform thereto look what Peter says in 1 Peter 2:5 ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house you are a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ can I just say this and don't get mad at me this beautiful building that God gave you New Life Outreach is not the church church it's not the church it's a beautiful building but brother kby it's not the church can I prove it to you y'all remember on the dedication Day come in here and the building was flooded that didn't stop us from worshiping God come on Amen y'all remember you come in here and move pews around and pack music down to the blue building and we had Church you know why because this is not about a building it's about a people who have been established upon the foundation of the spiritual Revelation that Jesus Christ is the Son of God he is the way he is the truth he is the life oh I say it to you folks the devil had to stand on the sidelines and watch this church scramble and go have church somewhere else you know why because we serve an unlimited God which means he has an unlimited number of solutions to any situation listen to this and I'm closing message of Grace message of Grace the message of Grace the message of Grace we know the scripture says Jesus is the Chief Cornerstone he is also the headstone now if we will think for just a few minutes that the seventh Church messenger was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words he's going to rebuild are you ready for this rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit not by power not by might but by my spirit sayeth the Lord not by organization not by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last days can I say this to you the church is not a building it's persons who have come in contact Direct contact by the holy spirit with this unlimited God who is named Jesus Christ God revealed and you identify that is the one of Matthew 16 it's a spiritual Revelation that the message sent to you is the person of Jesus Christ God has rebuilt a church by restoration folks that ought to make you raise your hands and say thank you Jesus brother Kenny didn't take all the broken pieces and just throw it away he rebuilt this church by the power of restoration I'm I'm gonna share this with you and I'm done several years ago I was I was talking with brother Donnie Reagan one day and I I asked him I said I hear you do a lot of furniture I said building and Woodwork and stuff I said I'd like to I'd like to see some of your work are pictures and he he just pulled his phone out started showing me a few of them and he said he said brother Andrew he said this one here is real special I said man that's a and it was this brother Kobe it was this great old big like entertainment center had all kinds of design and and F and fancy knobs on it I mean it was a Brother Don it was a beautiful I mean it it probably cover half this wall beautiful piece of wood and I said I said what's so special about that he said well he said several years ago he said we were driving down to brother Fred Mullins and we stopped by an antique store if I remember correctly and he said' we stopped by this antique store and he said we went in there and he said 'I saw this beautiful piece and I thought I really want to have that in my house he said I asked the guy how much it was and he told me and he said man he said that's that's pretty high he said I'll just pass this time he said so the next year we were going back down because there's always an infinite number of solutions he said the next year we're going back down and he said we got down there and he said we just stopped in there and he said I went in I was talking to the guy and I said 'he that piece is gone he said 'you must have sold it he said he said no he said follow me he said we went out back and if I if I remember correctly I don't want to tell nothing wrong but just going by memory he said I looked over and he said there was a bunch of boxes and they were all sitting there and he said there was full of pieces of wood and he said there it is brother he said that that was standing there last year is falling down I'm done preaching I'm just having fun is falling down and is in boxes and it's a it's a it's just out here for somebody to pick up for kenlan maybe or start a fire with it or it's just a bunch of scrap wood he said yeah it it got knocked over and it fell down it's broken he said we just put it in boxes out here but I said well how much you want for it he said you you can have it he said no how much you want for it he give him the price he said that's worth it he said I picked the boxes up and I loaded them in my truck and he said I drove them all the way home and for about two or three years she said every day I take a few hours and go down there and sand and work and cut and glue and finish and nail and put together and he said brother Andrew he said from boxes to this I said from boxes to a masterpiece come on come on folks just a few days ago it was in pieces it was laying in boxes ready to be thrown away but the difference was somebody that had a vision for it come by and picked it up and said there's an infinite number of solutions I don't care how many hours I don't care how many days I don't care how many sweatless I don't care how many sleepless nights I don't care what it takes I see that piece being restored L and standing upright again oh Church of the Living God and God is sent a message in this generation and we was a bunch of rejects in a bunch of boxes behind a bunch of churches but God who is rich in Mercy sent a seventh angel he said I will pick up the broken pieces and I will rebuild the church again I'm not going to do it under theology I'm not going to do it under education I'm not going to do it under denomination I'm going to do it under something Eternal I'll rebuild the church again by the Holy Ghost let our musicians come brother Joe he would rebuild the church again by the power of the Holy Ghost folks there's nothing can knock you down now there's nothing that can not knock you down now you have been rebuilt by the Holy Ghost what are he saying I'm saying the spiritual churches we stand to our feet the spiritual church has the pillar of fire the signs and wonders still has the same Christ which it vindicates all the way from the dying lamb in the Garden of Eden until the second coming of the Lamb absolutely the same yesterday today and [Music] forever can I say something to you this morning the characteristic of God is Not on display in heaven this morning it's on display right here in this church you say what do you mean by that well I mean this the how many knows the characteristic of God is Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever how many knows the characteristic of God is that he is the unchanging God which means he never changes come on folks brother Merl that that's almost mindboggling that the unchanging God is in a people who changes every second come on husbands y'all sitting there ready to go and your wife comes out I'm going to go back and change and you're ready to go and she now I'm going go back and change we're humans we change but there's a deity part on the inside of you and it's unchanging and the devil hates that brother he hates the fact that the stability of God is on display in the Church of the Living God I've been broken folks how many can how many can get on the page with me this morning I've been broken I've been in the Box I I'm I'm the preacher I've been in the Box I've been out back I'm human I've been there but I've been born to display the power of God folks you've been born to display the power of God God has invested in you God has invested in you he's invested in you the ability to work to pray to fast to study to dig in the word of God the unlimited God is in this church you know I start I start talking about this and I say this to you isn't it amazing how sometimes God can take things that looks as if there's nothing in there like like as if as if there's no way it could be done and out of what God chooses comes unlimited testimonies and miracles and signs and wonders like how many people has looked at this church drove by or seen you and said here ain't nothing coming out there but have you ever just stopped and thought about what all's come out of this church hello folks have you ever just stopped thought about all the all the Miracles and testimonies and Powerful things that's been done right here in this church it wasn't because we was the wealthiest people wasn't because we had the greatest education it was because we welcome the unlimited God into our midst ever thought about at a youth camp here in a few days how many young people have received the Holy Ghost because there's an unlimited God I remember I I know I'm going a little bit long but you forgive me this morning I'm I'm talking to the powerful church so how can I remember when brother brother Sean started those tent meetings out there I remember we we were sitting there talking one day about it I don't you you've heard the testimonies and I'm not going to go through all but I'm going to say this we sitting there talking he said we're going to have a tent meeting but we don't have a tent and I said well I said I know I we I know somebody we can get one and had all this lined up and then right out the clear blue this this person backed out and canceled and here's this tent and it's going to seek so many people and and we're scrambling and I feel like an idiot I we're and then all of a sudden it just Dawns on you but if God is in this it's unlimited do y'all realize the first year that brother Sean held those meetings there was a family sitting in that in that tent that was on the verge of walking away from the message they were done with the message and right there in that tent meeting a pastor who had a vision to build a plat form to preach the message of the hour and not personalities just to promote the message and Men of God mounted behind that pull pit and some of y'all were there and stood there service after service laying word against that devil that was trying to take that family out and today that man's preaching this message his kids are writing songs about this message they're in a solid message church have we forgot Who We Are have we sat down and counted all the issues and all the this and we don't have that have we forgot that we might not have a lot but if we got the unlimited God he can turn water into wine have we forgot if we've got the unlimited God he can do anything anywhere anytime under any conditions listen folks I refuse to forget I wonder this morning how many would take an oath with me and say as for me in my house today we refuse to forgive brother Miguel I refuse to forget the unlimited God Josh I refuse I'm sorry I refuse I've seen him do too much already and I know if he's done this much he's going to do a whole lot more brother Harry I know he will I know he will want you bow your hearts with us this morning the powerful Church of the Living God the very character nature display of God right here in Satan's Eden the very the very forgiveness of God the very power of God listen folks with every head bow every eye closed this morning this is more than just a power in the church it's an adoption on the church the character and the nature of Jesus Christ is on display that's what makes you such a powerful people what's that's that's what gives this church such a powerful punch against the kingdom of hell is there's a group of people assembled here that hasn't forgot the pit that God hewed him out of it's what makes you so powerful in your singing is you hadn't forgot where God brought you from what makes your pastor and these men of God that stand behind this pull pit and preach so powerful isn't their abilities or their Charisma or the way they can put a sermon together it's the fact that there is a power residing in them by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that has brought him to the Revelation there's an unlimited God in the midst of his people I wonder this morning how many could say Lord I'm taking the limits off I'm taking the limits off you have an unlimited and unlimited unlimited resources you

has so sweetly filled this building here today Lord as your anointing has so so saturated the hearts and lives of your children here this morning Father I believe that there's a group of people standing before me today that Satan hates he hates them because he could not stop our head he hates the fact that our Lord hung there on the cross and in his final in his final moments in his final his final breasts of life he hung there and the power of God was on display and he spoke the word and a man that was a thief was forgiven Lord I believe that there's a group of people here today Lord

can be done for your kingdom what can be done for your church what can be done for your people and Lord I know the devil hates the fact that out of these out of these equipped vessels here out of this rebuilt Church Lord Lord this Universal rebuilt church that you've built all around the world by the message of the hour he hates the fact that out of this out of of this out of this out of this fertile Church Lord there's many more souls being born there's many more lives being changed now father I pray this morning for every person under the sound of my voice those that will go back and

parking lot and y'all remember we had had a storm That was supposed to come through and as we would begin to pray sister Lee would have the her radar on her phone the storm would come and would split go around and we was eating at ranburger and the farmers were talking about all around Pon e how much rain they got but not paon e you know how we didn't have the money for the AC you know we didn't have money for whatever and God would provide time and time and time and time again you know the Lord would speak to Moses and said Beware lest thou forget how I brought you out of the house of bondage whenever you're drinking of the wells you didn't dig you're eating of The Vineyards you didn't plan don't forget I brought you here and sometimes it's easy to look at the things going wrong
