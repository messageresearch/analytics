some wonderful food today and uh so we sure appreciate all of you sisters and we say a great big God bless you amen if you um have your scriptures we'll uh read um before you are seated and we'll just look here and in Revelations 10 and um uh the eth verse and then we'll let you have your your your seats there praise the Lord and um it says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which stands upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said take it and eat it and it'll make thy uh belly bitter but it'll be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was sweet and my mouth as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues and kings and I um let's just go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your blessings tonight thank you Lord for your presence that we feel and we're just asking Lord that you would be with us in all that we uh would say here tonight and that you're Lord you would you would uh just block my mind from anything that would be contrary to your will but I ask that you would lift us all up into your precious anointing Lord and that you would be with us here tonight as our prayer Lord we know that one of these days real soon this we will have our last service and Lord we know that it's it's it's bound to happen lord it's it's it's just right around the corner we can feel it in the air and father we thank you for the for the the uh the urging of the Holy Spirit to our hearts we love you Lord in Jesus name we pray can the church say amen and amen God bless you you may be seated here this evening amen I have another uh scripture I'd also like to read there in 1 Corinthians the the 5th chapter and the eth verse and um and we how many loves the word of the Lord amen and um if you would put that up there sister keys I instead of turning to it I'll just um it says therefore let us keep the feast not with the old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the uh unleavened bread of sincerity and in truth now we understand that we are eating the words of life here today and um amen we are as we have been you know just dealing with um just little aspects to overcoming and um and tonight I want to um I I I just want to speak along the lines again of overcoming and uh taking all of the land we we want to take every bit of it there the the God had had promised Israel there uh and and and I and before I I I go into my thoughts here tonight I think sincerity eating this bread now first of all Israel's land was a natural land your land is the Holy Ghost and it's the the Holy Ghost is placing us in the book so you can't separate the holy ghost from the word it's the holy ghost that is placing you in the book the book is yours and so as Israel was given the promise to go into that land and as they are possessing the the land God promised them that all of the inhabitants he would go with them to drive out those inhabitants uh that were already in their land now that land was already there before the foundation of the world God already promised that in in uh to to uh Abraham he had promised it amen now we had gone through 400 years of uh of of of waiting and bondage but but the land was theirs nonetheless and I want to say tonight that everything that God has all that is provided in Jes Jesus Christ is your land every bit of it is yours you don't have to beg for it you don't have to ask for it the prophet even said you don't even have to pray for it it's yours just act in faith and possess it now amen and so uh uh is when they went to that land it was it was a promise and that there in Exodus 23 and 20 it says and behold I send an angel before for thee to keep thee in the way to bring thee into the place which I have prepared God's already prepared the place for Israel amen all they're going to have to do is just be willing they're going to have to have some fire in the gut they're going to have to have something that is that they want it more than anything else and if they're willing to do it amen God says I will go before you amen and and he says Be beware of him obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto your enemies and an adversary unto your adversaries amen that is a promise unto the Lord amen by the Lord to you and and he says for my angel shall go before thee bring thee in unto the amorites the hitti the perizzites the Canaanites the hivites and the jebusites and I will cut them off that is a promise now but now we find that as as Israel went in that that Israel uh did not uh dispossess all of the land did you know that amen now God gave them that land and and it was something that God had already prepared for them amen but because they did not have um that that that diligence in their heart to possess everything that God told them they could possess amen then then we found out that that that there was many of the zebus sites and many of the Hittites and many of these guys that were left in and God had already told them amen uh uh uh if you were to look there in in uh numbers 33 and 5 W he already gave them a promise that if they did not take it all he says speak unto the children of Israel and say unto them when you are passed over Jordan in the land of Canaan then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and destroy all their pictures destroy their ment images and quite pluck down all their high places you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein for I have given you the land to possess it you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families and to and to the more you shall give the more inheritance to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance Every Man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth according to the tribes of of your fathers um shall inherit it but if you will not drive out the inhabitance of the land before you then it shall come to pass that those which ye let remain of them shall be Pricks in your eyes thorns in your side and shall Vex you in the land wherein you dwell so I'm taking you to this land I I'm giving you this land I promise you that my angel is with you to drive out the inhabitants amen you just got to rely on me I'm I'm going to I'm going to lead you into battle can you say Amen but if you do not drive them out they're going to be Pricks in your eyes thorns in your side amen a and they're you're going to have to live with that enemy and how many knows that amen that that Israel the Philistines and the amorites and all of these amen they were Pricks to Israel amen they they were because Israel amen we find that that when Joshua is an old man if you were to go back in in uh at the end of Joshua there I believe it's Jos Joshua 20 amen where where Joshua was is an old man now and and and and the Bible says amen that there was still much land for Israel to possess it did not say that God did not give the land because Joshua done his job Joshua gave the land amen set it out there for all of Israel all of the tribes to possess but we find that Israel did not have the same um uh the the the the the same you know uh uh uh staying power that God had amen God was willing to take when he left them from Israel or or from Egypt and he and he dropped the plages and he and and he and he brought them through the 40 Years of wilderness God was in it for the long haul amen even though God was upset a time or two and and really to take them all out and here Moses steps up and amen but God was willing to take them all the way through to the journey to make sure the predestin seed would get there is that right but when they got to that land not everyone possessed it amen I I was looking there in judges uh um judges 1 and excuse me uh 19 it says the Lord was with Judah and he drave out all uh or drave out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had Chariots of iron and they gave Hein unto Caleb a as Moses said and his and he expelled then the three sons of Anan and then the 21st verse the children of Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem but the jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day the house of jodah uh Joseph they also went up against bethl and the Lord was with them and the house of Joseph sent uh to describe bethl now the name of the city before was l and the spies saw a man and come forth out of the city and they said unto him show us we pray thee the entrance into the City and we will show thee mercy and when he showed them the entrance they smote the city with the edge of the sword but let go the man and all his family and the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and called the name thereof L which is the name thereof until this day neither did Manasseh drive out all the inhabitants of Basim and of her towns nor of tanac and her hounds nor the inhabitants of D and her towns nor the inhabitants of ium and her towns nor the inhabitants of Meo megadoo uh and her towns nor but the Canaanites would dwell in that land and it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites to Tribute and did not utterly drive them out now God gave them this promise I'm going to go before you and if you'll obey and you'll take it I will be an enemy to your enemy I'll be an Hallelujah but the scripture says they had to fight to destroy and many did not have gut in uh fire in the gut they they they were yellowbellies they didn't have what it took to fight to press on to get their Victory and I want to tell you today amen not going to hold you long tonight but I'm going to tell you amen I am not going to allow any spirits of unbelief to keep me from this finality if God says I can have it then I'm going to possess it amen I don't care how hard I have to fight I don't care how hard I have to press on amen God says to take this book to eat this book and he would Empower me to speak those words of Promise amen and overcome the enemy in my life now I think that's the way that we should all be amen is God give me give me the courage give me the humility a give me the eyesight the vision to follow through with what God has promised me amen now if you were to go one down amen it it it says in the 29th verse neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwell in um gazer but the Canaanites dwelt in gizer among them uh uh neither did zebulun drive out the inhabitants of uh aitran nor the inhabitants of nahala uh but the Canaanites dwelt among them and they become tributaries neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of AKO nor the inhabitants of zidon nor of alab nor of isib nor of halba uh nor of epec AIC nor of RAB but the ashit dwelt among the Canaanites and the inhabitants of the land for they did not drive them out neither did neph drive out the inhabitants of Beth shimes nor the inhabitants of Beth uh but but he dwelt among the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land nevertheless the inhabitant of be uh whatever and and be hath uh became tributaries un them and the amorites forced the the children of Dan into the mountains for they could not suffer them to come to the but the amorites would dwell in the mounts of hers in ageline and in Shel uh shelan yet the hand of the House of Joseph prevailed so that they become tributaries so so we could we could just we could see here amen that though God gave the promise how many believes God give the did we not read that God gave him the promise how many believes God was able to do whatever it took hallelujah amen go God says that he would rain down hell if you go back and read through the Bible in those times when they were overcoming amen God would rain down hell he would he would he was doing all sending winds in he was doing all kinds of things Israel had to fight but God was but God would would give them the victories in their lives and so it is today amen as we are as we are here looking at the at this last stage of the journey I don't want to leave one inch of ground if God says I can possess the land don't you tell me that I can't have it if God says amen that I can live in power in Victory and that this church is going to be the most powerful Church of all the Seven Ages then buddy I'm standing up and saying God Count Me In I am willing for you to use me anoint me Hallelujah I I am I'm willing to step up and say that God is more than able Amen to give my daddy a a a brand new health right here before the Rapture I I am here to tell you that God can still give brand new livers I'm here to tell you that God can still save the alcoholics I'm here to tell you I am not willing to lay down in defeat when the Bible has been opened up to me Hallelujah he oh can you say Amen Victory to the people because God gave it to you amen hallelujah I I I that's the way that's the way it's got to be amen you look at the land of Israel where they're at today go back and look at the Bible what God gave to Abraham amen and what God gave and and the way that he laid it out to uh uh to to um Moses amen did you know that Israel still has a lot of land that that that that they are to possess amen amen yeah if you go back and look at the map uh you know there's a reason why those devils are doing what they're doing over there is because Israel owns a lot of that land amen a lot of that is still their land and Israel still has some possession to do amen it is hallelujah now I don't know amen maybe it's maybe they're not going to get it until amen the Millennium but I want to tell you God gave it to them and they could have it amen but they have been passive too long but I I can sense an urgency taking place over there in Israel amen something's going on they're getting a little bit of fire in the belly and said I I'm willing to fight I am sick of this I am tired of this I want Victory and I want to say tonight as a as a Son of God God gave me my land I'm not doing anything but living on my land and if Satan don't like it amen he can jump in the lake of fire amen I've got a promise and I'm going to St stand upon that word of God I'm going to believe and God's going to drive the enemy out now it's interesting that brother brandom in just just as the as the opening of the seals where he was as the Lord Was preparing him for the opening of the seals and and and he was he was still um uh the Lord was was showing him and he and he's and he's talking about it in Paradox there in Jeffersonville and he and he's talking about how he fell into a vision and um and and it looked like he was standing he says it looked like I was standing on the on the map of Palestine and and he says he was he was on this side of Jordan looking into the promised land amen and and looking across and he said and and this is what he said in the vision oh praise God over there is the promise there's where the promises of God are and and so he's standing on this side of Jordan looking over and saying the promises are there and and matters of fact he says I looked across the Jordan and I said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay every promise lays in that promised land now he is now the Lord is preparing him for this and there's a reason why I I took that familiar passage of scripture there in in Revelations the the 10th chapter because the Lord is is is preparing him for the opening of the word to the elect now this isn't see because the opening of the word is not for us just uh H uh it's not a mental thing it is your possession it's your place of authority it's God telling you you have legal rights not the jebusites amen not not all of those Canaanites and all of those other guys you and you alone have the land I've prepared it for you but there is enemy on your land now I I and now listen to me amen we can dilly dally around with Satan all we want we can dilly dally around with feelings all we want or we can come together with a heart of faith and something that is that is that is driving us in and and possess this land as we walk into to the Rapture well praise the Lord amen now now he brother brandham as he's he did at first he didn't know whether there was in a vision or dream and so we thought well maybe I dreamed it because it was at night and and when he came to himself he amen he was uh you know he he he he was sitting in a in a chair and uh and then as he sitting there wondering if if that was a vision or a dream all of a sudden it came back again and then he knew that it was a vision and he says then when I come into this Vision again it seemed I was lifted up sitting on a highway a narrow Highway with some brother and I I never knew who the brother was I looked around and I said now I'm I am sure and know that this is a vision the Lord God is here and it seemed like everybody was afraid I said what's everybody so afraid of and the voice came and said there's such danger in these days there's such hideous things that uh thing that deaths uh uh when it strikes you now I now listen Hallelujah I think I think the Lord is described where we're at right here right now I I I I I I believe the Lord is amen the Lord was letting him know the condition uh when the opening of this word would come and it says and a voice and a voice said there there's such danger in these days great hideous thing that death when when it strikes you and I heard weeds am masing down and I looked and here come A huge monster snake crawling through the weeds and I thought now knowing this is a vision then I shall see what this animal or this Beast is he crawled up on the highway and as soon as I got sight of him I knew it was a Mamba now a Mamba is an African snake which is the most deadly bite of all things there is there's nothing as poison as a Mamba the snake of course represents sin and death see and there we have in this country the rattlesnake the copperhead the cotton mouth moccasin uh many of these these snakes that if you're in bad health and want to bite you it perhaps kill you but but if you didn't get Aid uh of something right quick and then um uh uh it says then we go into Africa African India and we find the Cobra there's a black cobra that's a that's a bad snake it's a death bite too and there's a yellow Cobra Which is far beyond him yellow Cobra the patient dies with such a horrible death it dies from Suffocation and paralyzes the breathing system the can't breathe they they just open their mouth and gasp and trying to and die like that and and that was the type of snake that just one lick from getting Billy Paul and when when we got the snake in Africa and it and then comes the Mamba he's deaf he's so fast you can't see him he goes over the top of the weeds and prevails himself W with the back of his tail and just then he's gone he hits you in the face usually and stands up high and Strikes hard and when he hits you uh you just you just got a few breaths and and and you're finished it don't only paralyze you and get in your bloodstream it gets the nerves and everything you just die in a few seconds them native boys and track boys you you can you can say mama and they'll butt their heads together and scream because it's death in just a few moments in a few seconds when one hits you and here he was on the highway and I thought well th this is it so I looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and and and here he come but when he got close to me he would run up fast and then he would get slower and slower and just quiver and stop then something would hold him off and and he couldn't bite me he turned around on the other side and tried to approach and get back and and get a start and swish right towards me again and get slower and slower and slower and then I stop and then shake his head like that and move back he couldn't strike me then he turned and looked at my friend and I went away after my friend and I seen my friend just jumping way in the air and going over him and over him and over him and trying and the thing was striking at him and I thought oh if it ever hits him it'll be instant death no wonder everybody's so scared is because when this thing hits you it's an instant death and and I it was it was just striking at him like that I threw my hands up and I said oh God have mercy on my brother I said if that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him now now I I want you to catch what what the Lord is showing because this is not just this is not just a normal vision God's or a normal dream God is specifically preparing the prophet amen for what this word was going to mean he says and just then the serpent turned to me when I said that and looked at me again and a voice came from above me and said you've been given power to bind him the worst or any I said well God what must I do he said there's one thing you must do amen you must be more sincere there's one thing you must do everyone say it with me you must be more sincere and then he says it again you must be more sincere and I saidwell God forgive me for my insincerity and let me have sincerity and when I raised my hands up to him again there was something there was a great something came over me just lifted me up it seemed like my whole body was charged with something does that not remind you of of what God done to Israel if if you were to have read that that full chapter there in Exodus amen he he says that I will send hell I will send plagues I will come in amen I will I will be a a a warrior for you amen and and God is God is charging this Prophet charging him now watch and he says and I looked at that and when I say charging charging him with his power letting him know that what he possesses is is greater than any fo in the book any any fo in the world now remember the open book amen was was given by the mighty Angel to the seventh angel the seventh angel the Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen the mystery of God should be finished and then we picked up at the scripture that says you go to that angel and pick up the open book and you eat it for you have to prophesy so it's going from the lamb the mighty angel coming down giving it to the do to the seventh angel the seventh Angel's voice declaring it the bride going to not just listening to it on amen but going to the angel that anointed brother brandham and says give me that Revelation too because there's going to be an enemy greater than anything that's ever came all of the forces of hell are are are are are congregating in this last age to stop this bride and just as what we we haven't seen anything that what Israel is fixing to have to face amen what they're fix the world is fixing to come against them but I can prophesy to you right now she will win and I want to say this bride is going to win and we're going to win right here on Satan's own turf if the prophet of God says that limbs are going to be spoken into existence I believe it if the prophet of God says the dead shall raise again amen I believe it if the prophet says those things oh Church let's get amen let's get that a right of unbelief kick clean out let's slay That Old Devil can you say amen amen sorry for all my coughing my word amen hallelujah we're gonna kill that thing too amen then he started towards me but he couldn't and I said Satan now watch The Voice watch the words Satan in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I bind you and the serpent a blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made a a a a sign of an S capital S backwards amen capital S backwards and that means the and sign amen it means mind bind this one and anything below him because he was the worst the blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own self to death around his head and when he made this backwards s the an sign like a conjunction amen he says it choked it to death and the brother was free it went over and mashed on it I went over and mashed on it and I said now i' I've got to find out about this because it's a vision and I hit on the thing and it turned like like that and and and it looked like looked like a handle on a on a glass handle on a picture and and and just made a solid Crystal and I said think of that how quick the blue smoke was life and and and everything that left it all the elements it's just turned to Glass and just then a voice came again and said you can unbind him also and so I said then Satan that I may know I unbind you and when it did he started coming to life again wiggling and I said I bind you back in the name of Jesus Christ and when it did the smoke flew out of him again he choked himself right back again and turn to Crystal and when he did that the voice says You must must be more sincere than what you are to do this you must be more sincere do you see why I'm why I've been hitting those these just these little areas in our lives lately I feel like I I feel like we've got the basics down I really do I feel like we've got I think our I I I I I I I know we all love God I know we're so on this message I believe that but I I I if if the prophet of God needed to be more sincere amen before the before the book would be revealed I I believe that it requires if the prophet hello if the prophet had to be more sincere I I don't I don't I I don't I I don't even want to put myself in the category of the spirituality of the Prophet Lord help me to be sincere help me to be more sincere not not not not just I'll tell you how sincere brother brandham was and this is before this Vision brother brandham was telling a story you know telling a joke to to to to some of the brothers and uh oh they laughed and they thought it was pretty good one been one went back home and uh told his wife the joke and said brother bradam told us this joke and and and and it hurt the woman so bad y'all remember that and she said I can't believe that brother Brandon being a prophet would joke like that and and it was a clean joke it was a good I mean it was it was a funny joke but and do you know what brother brandom did he got up behind the pull pit and said see I I I I wasn't being careful enough and I hurt Lord help me and and he and he he and he repents before the people for joke there's nothing wrong with telling a joke Hallelujah I I would have said you need to get some thicker skin young lady and and you know right but no that's not the way it was the sincerity i i i i and if and if that and if that was that way toward that woman how much more towards us towards one another sincerity of not hurting one another amen and then the sincerity of not hurting God can you say Amen now and and and he says you you he says he he says now you you must be more sincere than what you are to do this then it left me and I was standing in the room and a few minutes I heard a clock go off and my wife was my wife got up and getting up and the children you you know how it is I guess at your house uh uh well you know one them ones what am I going to wear today mama and where are my books and what did I did I do and you know how how just like any home you can't hardly hear yourself think hardly for all of them trying to get ready at once well brother brandham had a real life just like you other ladies Amen brother brandham sister me so I slipped off into the den room and I got down on my knees and I said Lord Jesus I don't know these things what must I do and and the children will be calling me to take them to school in a few minutes what must I do and I looked around my Bible was laying there and I said Lord if you forgive me I I I don't I don't believe in just opening up the scripture and and taking something out of the Bible and saying that but there there's times when God can comfort you by such a thing and I said Lord in in this case of emergency right now before your spirit leaves me I I don't know what to do the kids will be uh be an hour yet before they're gone what would you what would you uh show me and and if that was something that you're trying to get to me heaven father then let me know and I took the Bible and I just pulled it open like that and my thumb was laying on 1 Corinthians the the fifth chapter and the eth verse when something reads something like this when uh uh he says now I was planning on taking a a fast to the Lord and I told him I'd go out and fast and and but it says when you come to this Feast there in 1 Corinthians 5 and 8 when when you um uh uh when you come to this Feast which a feast in the body is a feast with the Lord we know that so or a fast in the body is a feast with the Lord we know that so when you come to this Feast don't come with the old leaven or the leaven of malice and so forth but come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth just exactly what he had told me in the vision God is my solemn judge come with the unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth can you can can you say Amen now I I as as we think about this Lord Israel did not possess all of the land the mighty Angel was with them the prophet of God says the same angel that that Pillar of Fire that Pillar of Fire that was with brother brandom he says that was the same Angel the exact same angel that led the children of Israel to their promised land that Pillar of Fire that is over William bram's Head was the angel that told him I will destroy your enemies amen that's quite a study I I don't I'm not going to read all of those words where where the different ones said listen it's too hard to take can we have another land and and and God tells him get out there and possess the land that I've given you they were complaining well you've given them this and and we want the hill you've given us the Hill Country he says make make use of it it's your land and and and and you know we we might not own our own property here in in in in this life we we might be uh uh you know a renting or and and if we do own own something it's not much to count for but God has given us something that that is the greatest of all possession the Bible says the meek shall inherit the earth and we will inherit the earth so we're not trying to conquer this Earth that we have no we no land that we're trying that we're looking for God's promised us nothing here in this last age concerning that but what he has promised is I'm going to give you the title deed and you're going to find that all of me all everything that all of the Redemptive blessings healings all everything that you have need of in this life Journey from the cradle to the Rapture is right here and you can have it but it's going to require sincerity to follow after the Lord what is leaven we we know that the scripture says a little bit of leban Levan affects the whole lump amen is that isn't that what Galatians says he says you're gloring you you're you're you're your glorying is not good he's telling the glacia the church there at at glacia he says you you ran well but but but what is what what has hinder you that you obey not the truth now you're not you're know you're and it is it's it's there in Galatians where he says you started it but now you're you're sidetracked and everything else amen and and and he says listen he says a little bit of Leaven it it it Rens the whole Lum I I in in my thoughts of Overcomer I I think we we want to go through do do you do you remember what they used to have to do and they were to do this every Passover every time they were they done this as a tradition for years and years they were to God instructed them amen that at Passover that they were to take a candle and they would search throughout the entire house looking for leaven and they were to clean they were to search and clean out the entire house amen before Passover because they were fixed it was they had to have the leevan totally gone and they were required God told him take a lamp take a candle and make sure and and and and if we are going to get the L out of our Lives it's going to require real deep sincerity within us and I mean go through every Crook and cranny of our mind and if there's something that is that is leav that is ABS that is not God's word that is leading to unbelief then I think we need to pull away from it and get desire back where it belongs as I was saying last week get desire back where we need it I don't care what God's done for you yesterday and what God's done for me yesterday that are wonderful things but this is a new day I don't care that God brought you out of Egypt and God performed the Miracles and God brought you across the Red Sea and you are in your land this is a new day and if we are looking at the enemies on our land and choosing to get along with that enemy instead of defeating it we need to take the candle back to our heart and search for the leaven of unbelief God can only work in this bride in this last day when there is when you are feasting in with him with that unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth amen let it be let it be tonight oh God I'm going to get my I'm going to get my lamp out what what was the last what was the what was the thing when when when the bridegroom's voice came when The Voice or when the when the voice came behold the bridegroom cometh all of the lamps there was no lamps all the lamps had went out amen or or or or were going out because the Bible says that they had to trim their lamps but there was only a few that had the oil and the other few did not the foolish did not have oil the bride only had enough oil for themselves amen what does that oil represent the Holy Ghost so it takes the Holy Ghost the fire the flame of God to go through and say search me Lord in our morning times let's get serious about our prayer God's calling us to the feast the evening time is here this is the time of atonement the lamb has come and been made visible to us like none other before this is the Midnight Hour this is the Midnight Hour you're the elect you're the co out let's be deeply sincere with this that God's given us amen hallelujah we're going home don't go it this is not a fairy tale this is not a fairy tale we're going home I oh Hallelujah I I got a lot of clean up that I'm needing to do I've got a lot of Leaven in this old in this old mind and heart of mine I I I I I want it cleaned up and I'm asking you can't do it in yourself but it's pulling back and saying God give it to to me give me that sincerity renew it back to me again I I I'm going to go on that feast and sometimes a fast as brother as brother brandham said a fast of the body is is a feast to the Lord coming in and being sincere before him and asking him for his grace you are powerful because you have him as your head we well glory to God if God says that Devils can be cast out then I'm believing Devils can be cast out I still believe that God can still deliver we've said it so many times we don't preach it we we've heard it so many times we don't say it enough behind the pull pit here but how many can tell me what brother brandham says a good solid sign way to know that you are sealed he says mark them put a seal on them who cry and sigh for the sins that are done in the cities he says if your heart is not out for Souls then there's something wrong oh God you hear me selfishness getting in such a way now we I I've done I done I've done a lot of scripture did did you understand what I was preaching on this morning you you you you you says the disastrous times are coming men shall be lovers of themselves it's going down through all of this they will beloved themselves more than they will love the gift of God through the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I say today Lord I I'm coming back with a candle and I I'm going to search and whatever whatever is leavening up the lump whatever whatever it is I I'm whatever's grounding it out whatever Lord I here I stand here today can you saved man Hallelujah if the musicians would come there's a song we used to sing oh search me Lord search me Lord let your light shine from Heaven over my soul if you find

told him again and again you must be more sincere must be more sincere [Music] he was a reflection of the Bride when God wanted to show your inheritance he sent it to the prophet if he wanted to speak to the first age he he he gave it to the that angel messenger and when he'd done it to the last age he gave it to that angel messenger so whatever was given to that angel messenger was for each of us to partake in [Music] I love him here today I love him with all of my heart I I I I I'm I'm praying for the spirit of consecration to come over this church like never before renew us back to a
