[13:04] have a few testimonies and songs. And so
[13:07] if you've got u some testimonies,

[13:21] so, uh, if you've got some testimonies
[13:23] or songs that you want to leave, uh, and
[13:27] what we're going to do tonight, we're

[13:30] going to read a scripture and, um, maybe
[13:34] comment just a just a few moments and
[13:36] then I'm just going to turn the service
[13:37] to brother Kobe and um, and then we'll
[13:42] uh, just open it up however he feels to
[13:45] do it. And but why don't we just go to
[13:48] the Lord in prayer and um uh there uh
[13:52] what what do we have um let's see I
[13:56] brother um brother Andrew Glover text me
[14:00] today and um uh little Malachi
[14:05] got tripped up while playing ball and
[14:07] and broke his leg.
[14:10] And um so when you look at the picture,
[14:14] he's got he's got one leg,
[14:17] whole leg in a in a cast and then the
[14:19] other leg he's got is going halfway down
[14:21] in a cast. And so I don't understand the
[14:24] whole uh deal, but it and then a diaper
[14:27] look like a diaper on top of that cast.
[14:29] So um you know, so let's just pray for
[14:33] for little Malachi. My goodness. And um
[14:37] and then we also want to keep um
[14:42] Oh yes. And then there was also u a
[14:45] request an urgent request
[14:48] uh from sister Heather, brother Shaun's
[14:50] wife. And uh uh Faith and Anne works um
[14:58] works for these people. He said, "If
[14:59] y'all wouldn't mind keeping my manager
[15:01] in prayer," and this is actually the
[15:04] girls's manager. She is 37 weeks
[15:07] pregnant, has just been informed that
[15:10] her baby doesn't have lungs, kidneys,
[15:12] and gallbladder. The doctors told her
[15:15] the baby will die soon after birth. Uh
[15:18] Beth is in her early 30s, hasn't been
[15:20] able to have any children due to several
[15:22] miscarriages, and this is the first baby
[15:25] she's been able to carry to full term.
[15:28] So, let's We don't know, you know, the
[15:32] these people don't go to their church,
[15:34] but uh let's let's pray. My goodness, I
[15:39] I I just I wouldn't just wouldn't know
[15:42] how to feel, you know, uh if that was my
[15:45] baby.
[15:46] And then u we also want to pray for
[15:48] brother Steve Martin that um the Lord
[15:52] will just continue to pray for him that
[15:54] the Lord will intervene in his on his
[15:57] behalf. I am actually Fresa and I are
[16:00] are heading up there tomorrow and uh
[16:03] we're going to go spend some time with
[16:04] brother Steve and and um he hasn't been
[16:08] able to get out of bed in in a long time
[16:10] and and um so y'all be praying with us
[16:13] as well that when we go that the Lord
[16:15] will just give us a special
[16:18] this right words to encourage brother
[16:20] Steve and and um and and also that the
[16:24] Lord would just raise him up and raise
[16:26] him off that out out of that bed,
[16:28] multiple cerosis. He's he's he's fought
[16:32] it a long time and and and
[16:35] uh the Lord has given him grace, but I
[16:37] believe I believe God's grace is still
[16:39] uh uh prevalent today. Um and then
[16:43] another brother brother Mike and sister
[16:45] Denise's uh car truck broke down again.
[16:49] And so I want us to just pray that God
[16:51] will will bless them um bless them with
[16:55] a good good vehicle that that uh is not
[16:59] going to be breaking down on them. And
[17:02] so there there are needs, you know,
[17:04] God's come among us, but uh and and
[17:06] we're so thankful and um but there's
[17:09] always going to be needs in the world
[17:11] until Jesus comes. But the God that was
[17:14] with us during that meeting is the God
[17:16] that that is still going to be answering
[17:18] prayers tonight. So why don't we go to
[17:21] the Lord in prayer. Father, we just
[17:23] thank you for for life. Thank you for
[17:26] your blessings. Thank you, Lord, for
[17:30] this wonderful meeting that you've given
[17:32] us. And Lord, we we're just going to

[17:45] much
[17:47] we appreciate you coming among us. Lord,
[17:50] we ask that that you would just accept
[17:53] the praises from our hearts, Lord. You
[17:56] see these needs that we have we have
[17:58] brought before you, Lord. And we're
[18:01] asking, God, that you would that you
[18:04] would be with this lady, Lord, who's
[18:06] carrying this child. Lord, you're a
[18:09] miracle worker. Lord, if if you can
[18:12] perform miracles, if we as we have
[18:14] experienced this last week, we know that
[18:16] you can do that for them, for this lady
[18:19] here, Lord. And Father, we're asking
[18:22] that you would do a miracle on that
[18:24] child. Lord, that you would make it
[18:26] perfectly whole. God, I I pray, Lord,
[18:30] that you would be with Brother Mike and
[18:31] Sister Denise. And Lord, that you will
[18:34] bring victory for them. Lord, I know
[18:36] it's a trying time, Lord. Satan's
[18:39] hitting them in every way, but Lord,
[18:42] they're warriors. They're sons and
[18:44] daughters, and they're son and daughter,
[18:46] and there we're none of us are are we
[18:48] don't have give up in us, Lord. And I'm
[18:51] asking, Lord, that you would, we're just
[18:53] looking to you for miracles in several
[18:56] instances in their lives. Lord, thank
[18:58] you for what you're doing for Brother
[19:00] Steve. Lord, we're believing he's going
[19:02] to be up and be behind the pull pit
[19:04] preaching again, Lord. And we're just
[19:07] asking, Father, that you would renew his
[19:09] strength in his body and that you would
[19:12] heal him, Lord, and renew him in his
[19:15] spirit, Father. Lord, we just thank you
[19:17] for all things. just ask that your
[19:20] blessings would be upon this service
[19:22] here tonight in the name of the Lord
[19:24] Jesus Christ. Can the church say amen
[19:28] and amen? God bless you. Let's let's
[19:30] look here at at Psalms the And you can
[19:33] just keep on playing. We're not we're I
[19:35] won't be very long here. Amen.
[19:40] Uh there in Psalms 1 and 115.
[19:46] Praise the Lord.
[19:48] They um
[19:50] they uh this is a scripture that brother
[19:53] had read the other night and I'm just
[19:55] going to read it again. 115 and1 not
[19:58] unto us, oh Lord, not unto us, but unto
[20:00] thy name give glory
[20:03] for thy mercy and for thy truth's sake.
[20:07] Wherefore should the heathen say, Where
[20:09] now, where is now their God? But our God
[20:12] is in the heaven. He hath done
[20:14] whatsoever he hath pleased. Their idols
[20:18] are silver and gold, the work of men's h
[20:20] hands. They have mouths, but they do not
[20:23] speak. Eyes have they, but they see not.
[20:28] They have ears, but they hear not. Noses
[20:31] have they, but they smell not. They have
[20:34] hands, but they handle not. Feet have
[20:37] they, but they walk not, neither speak
[20:41] they through their throat. They that
[20:44] make them are like unto them. So is
[20:47] everyone that trusteth in them. Oh
[20:49] Israel, trust thou in the Lord. He is
[20:54] their help and their uh shield. Oh house
[20:58] of Aaron, trust in the Lord. He is their
[21:00] help and their shield. Ye that fear the
[21:03] Lord, trust in the Lord. He is their
[21:05] help and their shield. The Lord has been
[21:08] mindful of us. And he will bless us. He
[21:12] will bless the house of Israel. He will
[21:14] bless the house of Aaron. He will bless
[21:18] them that fear the Lord, both small and
[21:21] great. The Lord shall increase you more
[21:24] and more, you and your children. You are
[21:26] blessed of the Lord, which made heaven
[21:30] and earth, the heaven and even the
[21:33] heavens of heavens are the Lords, but
[21:35] the earth he has given to the children
[21:38] of men. The dead praise not the Lord,
[21:41] neither any that go down into silence,
[21:44] but he will bless the Lord from But we
[21:47] will bless the Lord from this time forth
[21:51] and forever more. Praise the Lord. God
[21:56] bless you. You can be seated here this
[21:58] evening. And I think that should be our
[22:00] attitude is to give blessings unto the
[22:04] Lord. you know, we um I think we have a
[22:08] lot to be thankful for and um he's
[22:12] always been so good. And I've thought
[22:15] about the word, the word that was so
[22:17] rich as it has come uh forth. How many
[22:20] enjoyed the messages during this last
[22:22] week?
[22:23] [Applause]
[22:26] And it's so good to see young men that
[22:30] that's got such fervor for this message.
[22:33] And um it it gives it gives a lot of
[22:38] a a lot of um courage to to to just you
[22:43] know as I'm getting older now you know
[22:46] dad used to look at me and say you know
[22:49] you're you're you're the next
[22:50] generation. Give it all you've got. Make
[22:52] sure it counts and and uh uh don't
[22:56] deviate. And then now that I'm getting a
[22:58] little bit older and I I've uh I' I've I
[23:02] see the young men in our church that are
[23:04] preaching and the young men that
[23:05] preached in the meeting and and to see
[23:09] the ferveny and and and to to get it
[23:12] right and to uh preach the message, it's
[23:16] a blessing. And and uh there were some
[23:19] of us texting a little bit today sharing
[23:22] quotes and and here's just a few of
[23:24] them. Brother, I I believe it was
[23:26] brother William that that shared this.
[23:28] Um or maybe this was uh Brother Sam. Um
[23:34] brother Sam or brother William sent
[23:36] this. We were sending some some text
[23:38] today. Says, "I love the word." Uh this
[23:41] is the prophet. The Holy Spirit feeds on
[23:44] the word of God. Christians should
[23:47] always read the Bible for the Holy
[23:49] Spirit feeds. Its food is the word of
[23:52] God. Man shall not live by bread alone.
[23:56] Amen. There it is. But by every word
[23:59] that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
[24:01] That's what Christians live on. The
[24:03] word. The Holy Spirit loves the word.
[24:07] And he is here tonight to receive the
[24:11] word. It's in you. As the word comes
[24:15] forth and the Holy Spirit takes the word
[24:18] of God and reveals it to you. Isn't that
[24:22] powerful? Amen. And I I sent this one
[24:25] here out of indictment. It says, "And
[24:28] that's what he is only a reflection of
[24:31] the word." Talking of Jesus. That's what
[24:34] he is today. A reflection of the word
[24:37] trying to find somebody to reflect
[24:39] himself through. Go on down. Jesus
[24:42] Christ was the person, the man, God.
[24:45] Hallelujah. He was the manifestation of
[24:48] God. He was God in a body form to
[24:51] reflect the word for that age to make
[24:54] that age see God's promise for that
[24:58] word. Amen. So Jesus was to he was the
[25:02] body form of God to make the age see the
[25:06] promise for the age. And the Holy Ghost
[25:09] is the same today. It's the spirit of
[25:12] God upon the written word trying to find
[25:16] somebody to reflect itself to this age
[25:20] to prove that he's the same yesterday,
[25:22] today, and forever. St. John 14:12, the
[25:26] works that I do shall you do also. Jesus
[25:29] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[25:32] forever, constantly trying to find and
[25:36] to reflect itself. Can you say amen?
[25:39] Amen. So uh we we are so we are thankful
[25:43] for that today. Amen. That God himself
[25:48] all we have to do is believe the word
[25:52] and if he can find believers find
[25:55] believers the Holy Spirit is right there
[25:58] to uncction it to make it real to make
[26:01] it come off the pages and to make it
[26:03] live. And I say this week God has made
[26:06] those words to come off the pages. It
[26:09] comes through the anointing of his Holy
[26:10] Spirit. Amen. Aren't you glad for that?
[26:13] Amen.
[26:15] Amen. Here's a another one. You say
[26:18] there's nothing impossible with God. Do
[26:21] you believe that? Then there's nothing
[26:24] impossible with you either. Amen.
[26:27] Nothing impossible. Another one. You're
[26:30] an offspring of God. God is in you. He
[26:33] will believe his own word though it
[26:35] can't be seen, felt, taste, or anything.
[26:38] you'll believe it. See, I see what I
[26:41] mean. For in for God in you believes his
[26:46] own word. So, as we as we look at these
[26:50] at these um these quotes and we can see
[26:55] day by day these scriptures are coming
[26:57] to pass. These quotes are coming to pass
[27:00] and it makes me thankful that I'm a
[27:02] believer. Amen. So, I want I I'm I'm I'm
[27:06] asking uh I I'd like to just hear from
[27:08] as many of you as as uh as possible and
[27:11] feel free to sing. I'm going to give it
[27:13] to Brother Kobe and uh Brother Kobe will
[27:17] will lead us in in uh in praise and

[36:46] &gt;&gt; Good evening.
[36:49] So, I have a bit of a praise report uh
[36:53] concerning my grandpa.
[36:56] We've been praying for him because we
[36:58] thought he had a stroke uh recently and
[37:01] that his health had declined very
[37:02] rapidly,
[37:04] but
[37:07] it just kind of hit me a little bit
[37:10] differently than it normally would.
[37:14] But
[37:16] I started praying about it and having
[37:19] you guys pray about it. And during the
[37:22] meetings,
[37:25] I just asked God to
[37:29] just help him just in any way he can and
[37:32] to help me with my sincerity.
[37:36] And we just got report back that my
[37:40] grandpa's stroke was really an infection
[37:45] that is going to be healed and he's
[37:48] going to be fully recovered here pretty
[37:50] soon.
[37:51] He's still
[37:53] he still has dementia, but that's just
[37:55] one step closer. And I believe God can
[37:58] do anything.
[38:16] Well, I searched the world,
[38:21] but it couldn't fill me.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; And all man's empty praise. Treasures
[38:29] that fade are never enough.
[38:35] But you came along.
[38:40] You put me back together.
[38:45] And now every desire is now satisfied
[38:51] here in your love.
[38:56] There's nothing
[38:59] better than you. Oh, there's nothing
[39:04] better than you. There's nothing
[39:10] better than you.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; And I'm not afraid.
[39:25] to show you my weakness.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; All my failures and flaws, you've seen
[39:33] them all and you still call me friend.
[39:39] Cuz the God of the mountain
[39:44] is a God of the valley.
[39:49] And there's not a place your mercy and
[39:53] grace won't find me again.
[40:00] Cuz there's nothing
[40:03] better than you. There's nothing
[40:07] [Music]
[40:08] better than you. There's nothing
[40:13] nothing is better than you.
[40:19] Cuz there's nothing
[40:23] better than you. There's nothing
[40:27] better than you. There's nothing
[40:31] [Music]
[40:32] nothing is better than you.

[42:12] &gt;&gt; There's nothing
[42:15] better than you. There's nothing
[42:19] better than you. There's nothing
[42:24] nothing is better than you.
[42:28] [Music]
[42:30] Oh, there's nothing
[42:34] better than you. There's nothing
[42:38] better than you. Oh, there's nothing
[42:43] nothing is better than you.
[42:51] You turn mourning to dancing.
[42:55] You give beauty for ashes.

[43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm so glad. He gives beauty for
[43:47] ashes. Amen.

[43:51] God we serve. How can we not praise a
[43:53] God like that? My goodness. Amen. Takes
[43:57] our worst times and difficult times and
[43:59] just turns it into something great.
[44:01] Amen. Can we sing that song as we open
[44:04] the floor back up? Can we go down a key?
[44:07] It's your breath
[44:10] in our lungs.
[44:13] So we pour out our praise. We pour out
[44:18] our praise. It's your breath
[44:21] in our lungs.
[44:24] So we pour out our praise to you, oh
[44:29] it's your breath
[44:31] in our lungs.
[44:34] So we pour out our praise. We pour out
[44:38] our praise at your breath
[44:42] in our lungs.
[44:44] So we pour out our praise to you, oh
[44:49] [Music]
[44:52] great are you, Lord. It's your breath.
[44:57] Oh,
[44:59] it's your breath
[45:02] in our lungs.
[45:04] We pour out our praise.
[45:09] It's your breath
[45:11] in our lungs.
[45:14] So we pour out our praise to you, holy.
[45:21] Great
[45:23] are you, Lord.
[45:27] As they continue to play that softly
[45:29] here tonight, I'd like to All right,
[45:31] Brother Josh, you're all you're ready to
[45:34] go. Amen. How many appreciates Brother
[45:36] Josh?
[45:38] Amen.
[45:41] Yes, sir. God bless you now.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I thought the meetings were just
[45:51] tremendous, the the services, the the
[45:53] food especially
[45:55] um from the start of the meeting to the
[45:58] end. Brother Matthew preaching on
[46:00] accepting his call, you know, and I
[46:03] thought it was amazing how each service
[46:04] is built on top of each other.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; One thing that really I guess stood the
[46:09] most to me was brother Zachary's story
[46:12] on the pig. I'm sure everybody remember
[46:14] that and that stuck with everybody on
[46:17] and he was explaining to in the office
[46:18] how that he what he normally does with
[46:21] the when he's preaching to the younger
[46:23] children he says I wouldn't do it I
[46:25] wouldn't get in there with the pig but
[46:27] if it was a human in there said it's
[46:29] completely different I'm willing to get
[46:31] dirty you know and God was willing to
[46:33] get dirty and that just really just
[46:35] registered even as a minister and adult
[46:38] now even something so simple that even
[46:41] when we were you you know, running away
[46:44] from the things of the Lord. He was
[46:46] still calling on our lives and willing
[46:48] to get dirty in order for us to come to
[46:50] our fulfillment that God has for us. And
[46:53] that was something that really stood out
[46:55] to me. And so, I want to sing this
[46:57] little song here. It's a Polar song, but
[47:00] I hope it's it's a simple song, but I
[47:01] hope it's a blessing to you tonight.
[47:06] I was there when you drew the breath of
[47:10] life.
[47:13] I could hear your voice the first time
[47:16] that you cried.
[47:20] And though you couldn't see me,
[47:24] I was very near. And there's something
[47:28] now I want you to hear.
[47:34] You'll always be my child in my eyes.
[47:41] When you need some love, my arms are
[47:44] open wide.
[47:48] And even when you're growing old, I hope
[47:52] you realize
[47:55] you'll always be my child in my eyes.
[48:01] I was there the first time that you
[48:05] prayed.
[48:08] I could hear all the promises you made.
[48:15] And then when you fell before me,
[48:18] crying, "Father, I have sinned."
[48:22] I picked you up and held you close
[48:25] again.
[48:29] You'll always be my child in my eyes.
[48:36] When you need some love, my arms are
[48:39] open wide.
[48:43] And when
[48:45] growing old, I hope you realize
[48:50] you'll always be my child in my eyes.
[48:56] I was there the first time that you
[49:00] prayed.
[49:03] &gt;&gt; I could hear all the promises you made.
[49:10] And when you fell before me, crying,
[49:14] "Father, I have sinned."
[49:17] I picked you up and held you close
[49:20] again.
[49:22] Yes.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; You'll always be my child in my eyes.
[49:31] When you need some love, my arms are
[49:34] open wide.
[49:38] And even though you're growing old, I
[49:41] hope you realize
[49:44] you'll always be my child in my eyes.
[49:49] [Music]
[49:51] You'll always be my child in my eyes.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; When you need some love, my arms are
[50:01] open wide.
[50:05] And even though you're growing old, I
[50:09] hope you realize
[50:12] you'll always be my child in my eyes.
[50:18] You'll always be my child in my eyes.
[50:28] [Applause]
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. You enjoy that here tonight. Amen.
[50:37] Amen. As we get ready to open the floor
[50:39] up again, can we sing that? Let the weak
[50:44] say I am strong.
[50:48] Let the poor say I am rich.
[50:54] Let the blind say I can see.
[50:59] It's what the Lord has done. Can we sing
[51:03] that again? Let the weak, let the weak
[51:07] say,
[51:09] &gt;&gt; oh might. And let the poor say I am
[51:14] rich.

[51:22] what the Lord has done for me." Hosana.

[51:36] that was slain.

[51:44] Jesus died. As we sing this, whoever
[51:47] wants to bring their special, go ahead
[51:48] and come up into the river or testimony.
[51:52] I will wait
[51:55] there. My sins are washed away
[52:00] from the heavens.
[52:03] Mercy streams
[52:06] of the Savior's love for me. Can we do
[52:10] that last verse?
[52:12] Now rise from waters deep
[52:16] into the saving arms
[52:20] of God.
[52:22] I will sing salvation
[52:26] songs.
[52:27] Jesus Christ that set me free.

[59:53] wonderful. The love of Jesus is so
[59:57] wonderful. Oh, all righty young people.
[1:00:00] It's so high. It is so high. You can't
[1:00:05] get over it. So low, you can't get under
[1:00:10] it.
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:12] You can't get over it. Oh. All right.
[1:00:15] The next one to bring your testimony is
[1:00:17] special. Come on now. It is so high you
[1:00:21] can't I'm thankful for that. It's so low
[1:00:25] you can't get under it.
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:31] Oh, can we do that again? It's so high.
[1:00:35] It is so high. You can't get over it. So
[1:00:40] low. What a love. Oh my.
[1:00:44] [Music]
[1:00:47] around it. Oh, wonderful love.
[1:00:52] What a love. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:00:56] Amen.
[1:00:57] What a love. God bless you, Sister
[1:00:59] Angie. I heard you're singing tonight.
[1:01:02] Is that right?
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Absolutely not.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; God bless her.
[1:01:12] Well, Caleb, I was so hoping you would
[1:01:14] sing that song tonight. That's been the
[1:01:16] song I've been singing all week. That's
[1:01:19] the theme of the meetings to me is he
[1:01:22] turns morning into dancing.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; If I could just paint a little
[1:01:28] background of the picture to tie this
[1:01:31] together, it would still not do justice
[1:01:33] of what I'm about to tell you.
[1:01:36] Right after our meetings three years ago
[1:01:38] on September 15th, my life turned into a
[1:01:41] living hell. During this time, I've
[1:01:44] often felt like Job as I watched my life
[1:01:47] shatter and seemingly disappear right
[1:01:49] before my eyes. With great losses, no
[1:01:52] income, surgery, sicknesses, and many
[1:01:54] trials beyond what I could fathom. The
[1:01:57] shepherd was leading me into the darkest
[1:01:59] valley I've ever been in.
[1:02:01] But little did I know the amount of
[1:02:03] trust in God I would truly gain
[1:02:07] and only one set of footprints would be
[1:02:09] seen for miles and they certainly would
[1:02:11] not be mine.
[1:02:13] I can't even begin to tell you how many
[1:02:15] times a supernatural has taken place and
[1:02:18] how many times God provided when it
[1:02:20] looked impossible.
[1:02:22] Recently when brother Wendle encouraged
[1:02:24] us to do the Bible in a year app and
[1:02:26] then brother George came I told him that
[1:02:29] was awesome and he preached the same
[1:02:30] thing brother Wendell did. He said did
[1:02:33] you get the message? I said yes I
[1:02:36] believe I did. And from that time on I
[1:02:38] have taken it seriously. My studies have
[1:02:40] been lining up countless times with the
[1:02:42] sermons preached leading up to the
[1:02:44] meetings. I've been studying the
[1:02:46] promises and faith of Abraham, the keys
[1:02:49] to the kingdom. He's in the boat. Though
[1:02:51] I walk through the valley of the shadow
[1:02:53] of death, asking big and expecting,
[1:02:56] thanking him for it in advance. My
[1:02:58] scripture, the Lord, the Lord spoke to
[1:03:00] me that I read every day. Jeremiah
[1:03:03] 29:11.
[1:03:04] One service when Caleb Farweather was
[1:03:06] singing, "Your cries have awoken the
[1:03:08] master. A revelation struck me that God
[1:03:12] has heard every prayer and truly my
[1:03:15] cries were awakening the master. It was
[1:03:17] becoming more real to me and I was in
[1:03:20] great expectation for these meetings. I
[1:03:23] knew he was going to do something
[1:03:24] special for me. To be honest, it was all
[1:03:27] such a blur, but to whether I heard it
[1:03:30] on tape, in my scripture reading, or if
[1:03:32] it was preached during the meetings,
[1:03:34] because all of it that I'd been
[1:03:35] studying, including,
[1:03:38] sorry,
[1:03:42] Jeremiah 29:11
[1:03:44] had been preached multiple times
[1:03:46] throughout the meetings, and it all just
[1:03:48] meshed together.
[1:03:49] Satan told me ahead of time, I'm going
[1:03:51] to give you a bloody nose in the prayer
[1:03:53] line and it will just mess it up and you
[1:03:55] can't go all the through all the way
[1:03:57] through. You'll have to step out and you
[1:03:59] won't get your prayers answered. Well,
[1:04:02] sure enough, as the prayer line began,
[1:04:03] my nose started pouring blood. As I was
[1:04:06] in the back in the as I was back in the
[1:04:09] bathroom, I said to myself, he is not
[1:04:11] going to keep me out of there. So, I
[1:04:13] shoved another Kleenex up my nose, kept
[1:04:15] my hand over over and went back in the
[1:04:18] sanctuary to show him I meant business.
[1:04:21] This year was different. I had a
[1:04:23] sturdier faith and I said, "I'm going to
[1:04:25] go through that prayer line different
[1:04:27] this time. I'm going up expecting and
[1:04:29] thanking him in advance." I made a list
[1:04:32] of things I was asking for before I went
[1:04:34] in. And I told myself, I'm not going to
[1:04:36] think of the problems when I go through.
[1:04:38] I'm going to focus on thanking him for
[1:04:40] the answers. As brother Ronnie was
[1:04:43] preparing for the line prayer line, he
[1:04:45] said, "This time, let's do it different.
[1:04:47] Let's make a list and tell him what we
[1:04:49] need and then go through thanking him
[1:04:51] for it." Wow. Confirmation.
[1:04:54] [Music]
[1:04:56] Sunday.
[1:05:00] Sunday, I woke up early in the morning
[1:05:02] and played my Bible in a year app. The
[1:05:05] past few studies have been on suffering
[1:05:06] and about Job. Then I turned brother
[1:05:09] Brandham on and he also talked of Job
[1:05:12] and his sufferings. When I got to
[1:05:14] church, Brother Wendell said, "The
[1:05:15] meetings aren't over yet. We've got one
[1:05:17] more service and there's more." I'm
[1:05:20] telling you, when Brother Matthew spoke,
[1:05:22] it wasn't just a man preaching a sermon.
[1:05:25] It was deity in flesh. Thus sayaith the
[1:05:29] Lord speaking directly to me. as he
[1:05:33] preached, "Though I walk through the
[1:05:35] valley of the shadow of death, thou
[1:05:37] mighty man of valor, you're a son of
[1:05:40] God." I said, "Yes, that's me." Satan
[1:05:43] said, "Oh, that can't be you." He said,
[1:05:45] "You're a son of God." So, he's just
[1:05:46] talking to the men. But then, Brother
[1:05:48] Matthew turned my direction, locked eyes
[1:05:52] with mine, but it wasn't his eyes. It
[1:05:55] was like I was looking into the eyes of
[1:05:57] Christ. There was a light in them. And
[1:05:59] he said, "You're a daughter of God."
[1:06:02] Something overshadowed and lingered
[1:06:04] around me.
[1:06:06] As he then spoke of my exact problems
[1:06:09] right down to a broken marriage, you've
[1:06:11] been sick for 10 years. Your car
[1:06:13] troubles, your finances, too specific
[1:06:15] that I could not doubt it was directly
[1:06:17] to me. And then he said, he's turned
[1:06:20] your mourning to dancing. and something
[1:06:23] struck my body and my legs began to
[1:06:25] quiver and my feet were bouncing and I
[1:06:27] wanted to take off running around the
[1:06:28] building.
[1:06:31] Right then and there, God totally
[1:06:33] delivered me of a slave mentality that
[1:06:35] has was embred deep within me due to
[1:06:38] many past years of spiritual trauma of
[1:06:41] man's ideas. I know my cries have awoken
[1:06:44] the master. He promised me an expected
[1:06:46] end. I asked God for big things and now
[1:06:50] I rest and wait for them to manifest. I
[1:06:53] can tell you with a steadfast faith and
[1:06:55] sincere heart that though God slay me
[1:06:59] yet I will trust him. And just like Job,
[1:07:03] God is going to restore everything and
[1:07:05] then some, he is faithful.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; You really just don't know like I know
[1:07:12] what he's done for me. And this is only
[1:07:14] the beginning of my story.
[1:07:17] I also want to say thank you, brother
[1:07:18] Windle. You did it right. I know it's
[1:07:21] not been easy. You've had to hear me
[1:07:23] cry. You've had to pick me up. You've
[1:07:25] had to spank me. But you never babyed
[1:07:27] and cuddled me. But you've always been
[1:07:29] there for me. You always directed me to
[1:07:32] the word. And you let the Lord do the
[1:07:34] work. How blessed we are to have a
[1:07:36] spiritfilled pastor preaching only the
[1:07:38] true word of God. Thank you for the
[1:07:40] burden for the meetings and for your
[1:07:42] people. We are truly blessed and I am
[1:07:45] very thankful.
[1:07:48] [Applause]
[1:07:56] Amen. Did you enjoy that?
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Caleb. Amen. I wish
[1:08:01] Brother Isaac was here tonight. I I tell
[1:08:03] you, I love that song. Praise him in
[1:08:05] advance, man.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Love to hear that again. God bless you.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Um I really enjoyed the meetings and I
[1:08:11] left refreshed, you know, closer to God.
[1:08:15] Um, I really particularly enjoyed the
[1:08:17] whole pig scenario as well because I can
[1:08:20] relate to the pig.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; You know, I was down in a spot where
[1:08:23] where nobody else could help me out,
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; only God, you know. So,
[1:08:28] &gt;&gt; could you put the words up to goodness
[1:08:29] of God?
[1:08:35] [Music]
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; I love you, Lord.
[1:08:43] For your mercy never fails me,
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; all my days I've been held in your
[1:08:53] hands.
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:08:56] From the moment that I wake up
[1:09:00] until I lay my head,
[1:09:04] I will sing
[1:09:06] of the goodness
[1:09:09] of God.
[1:09:11] Cuz
[1:09:14] all my life you have been faithful.
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:22] And all my life you have been so so good
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:29] with every breath that I am able.
[1:09:35] I will sing of the goodness
[1:09:40] of God.
[1:09:43] I love your voice.
[1:09:48] You have led me through the fire.
[1:09:52] In the darkest nights, you are close
[1:09:57] like no other.
[1:10:00] I've known you as a father.
[1:10:04] I've known you as a friend
[1:10:08] and I have lived in the goodness
[1:10:13] of God.
[1:10:15] [Music]
[1:10:18] Cuz all my life you have been faithful.
[1:10:26] And all my life you have been so so
[1:10:30] good.
[1:10:33] With every breath I am able.
[1:10:39] I will sing of the goodness
[1:10:44] of God.
[1:10:48] Your goodness is running after. It's
[1:10:52] running after me.
[1:10:56] Your goodness is running after. It's
[1:10:59] running after me.
[1:11:02] With my life laid down, I surrender now.
[1:11:06] I give you everything.
[1:11:09] [Applause]
[1:11:11] Your goodness is running after. It's
[1:11:14] running after me.
[1:11:18] Cuz all my life you have been faithful.
[1:11:23] Oh,
[1:11:26] and all my life you have been so so
[1:11:31] good.
[1:11:33] With every breath that I am able,
[1:11:39] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1:11:45] Sing that again.
[1:11:48] Cuz all my life you have been faithful.
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:55] And all my life you have been so so
[1:12:00] good.
[1:12:03] With every breath that I am able,
[1:12:09] I will sing of the goodness of God.
[1:12:18] [Applause]
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:32] There we go. My fault. Amen. We can all
[1:12:35] sing of his goodness. Amen. Can we sing
[1:12:38] this song as we continue to to uh open
[1:12:43] the floor? I've enjoyed all the
[1:12:44] testimonies and specials tonight. It's
[1:12:46] been good. Appreciate everyone's
[1:12:47] participation. Um, can we go to F? Let's
[1:12:50] see this. Oh, morning.
[1:12:55] I see you in the sunrise
[1:12:59] every morning.
[1:13:03] It's like a picture that you painted for
[1:13:08] me.
[1:13:11] A love letter in the sky.
[1:13:17] Oh, story.
[1:13:22] I could have had a really different
[1:13:26] story.
[1:13:30] You came down from heaven to restore
[1:13:35] me. God, help me sing it. Forever change
[1:13:40] my life. Nobody loves me like he loves
[1:13:44] me.
[1:13:45] Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus.
[1:13:52] I stand in all of your amazing
[1:13:57] ways.
[1:14:00] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[1:14:07] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[1:14:12] loves me like you.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I love this. Oh, mountains.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; You're breaking down the weight of every
[1:14:25] mountain.
[1:14:29] Even when it feels like I'm surrounded,
[1:14:36] he promised you never leave my side.
[1:14:42] [Music]
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Nobody loves me like you love me, Jesus.
[1:14:51] Oh my, I stand in all of your amazing
[1:14:57] ways.
[1:14:59] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[1:15:06] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[1:15:11] loves me like you.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Sing it now. Nobody loves me like you
[1:15:16] love me, Jesus. Nobody loves me like you
[1:15:21] love me, Jesus.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; I stand in all stand in all of your
[1:15:28] Amazing
[1:15:29] waves.
[1:15:32] I worship you as long as I am breathing.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[1:15:44] loves me like you.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; As they continue to play that softly
[1:15:50] now, just Amen. I've done it again.
[1:15:52] Sister Bree's already ready.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, God bless her here tonight.
[1:16:00] I'm going to try to do this without
[1:16:01] crying like I always do. Um, going into
[1:16:05] the meeting, I'm going to read off my
[1:16:06] phone because I will forget everything I
[1:16:08] wanted to say. But going into the
[1:16:10] meetings, a million things were on my
[1:16:12] mind.
[1:16:13] My family especially has weighed heavily
[1:16:17] the most.
[1:16:19] But the window knows throughout the
[1:16:20] years I have come up many times praying
[1:16:22] for my family or just text them randomly
[1:16:25] asking for prayer.
[1:16:27] As you all know, my uncle Jason
[1:16:28] committed suicide a few weeks before the
[1:16:31] meetings.
[1:16:32] Uncle Jason was the uncle that I've been
[1:16:34] closest to my whole life. He was the one
[1:16:36] that was the most involved with me
[1:16:39] specifically and he was truly a second
[1:16:41] father to me. Losing him felt like a
[1:16:44] direct attack from the devil because I
[1:16:47] had just felt like I had gained my
[1:16:48] strength after my parents moving away.
[1:16:53] We had a peace that he had made his life
[1:16:56] right before his mental illness took
[1:16:57] over.
[1:16:59] I felt closure, but the bitterness of
[1:17:01] yet again feeling like everyone I've
[1:17:02] ever loved growing up is taken from me
[1:17:05] seemed to surface a little bit more.
[1:17:08] This is not a bragging thing to say.
[1:17:11] Instead, I say it with much pain.
[1:17:13] Throughout my life, I've been to more
[1:17:15] family funerals than I have weddings or
[1:17:17] births.
[1:17:19] It takes a toll on a young person's
[1:17:21] heart.
[1:17:23] I needed the Lord to strengthen me and I
[1:17:25] felt his presence the first night of the
[1:17:27] meetings
[1:17:28] right in my seat right after brother
[1:17:30] Matthew got done preaching.
[1:17:32] I felt the Lord working on my heart to
[1:17:35] let go of the pain completely and not
[1:17:36] let the devil
[1:17:39] not let the devil take root again.
[1:17:43] My biggest prayer in losing my uncle has
[1:17:45] been for my aunt and cousins to
[1:17:47] surrender to the Lord fully.
[1:17:48] Miraculously, they have been asking
[1:17:51] questions, reading brother Brandham
[1:17:53] books, calling Robert, calling my dad,
[1:17:55] and talking to my papa a lot. They've
[1:17:58] been also going to church there in Beach
[1:18:00] Island since Uncle Jason's passing. I am
[1:18:03] so grateful to see this bring them
[1:18:06] closer to the Lord instead of them
[1:18:07] running further. This leads to a
[1:18:10] testimony that I've been estatic to
[1:18:11] share since I got the news Tuesday.
[1:18:16] My mother's brother Mark left the
[1:18:18] message a few years ago. He went down a
[1:18:20] path that was filled with adultery,
[1:18:22] alcoholic lifestyle, and drugs. He
[1:18:25] secluded himself away from all family,
[1:18:27] religious or not. My uncle served the
[1:18:30] Lord for many years before he left to do
[1:18:32] his own thing.
[1:18:34] Well, in my uncle Jason's passing, it
[1:18:36] stirred up something in my uncle Mark's
[1:18:38] heart. I got a call that this past
[1:18:41] Monday evening, he went to my papa and
[1:18:42] asked for prayer, and it turned to him
[1:18:44] leading to him giving his life and heart
[1:18:48] back to the Lord Jesus.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; He is completely separating himself from
[1:18:52] everything that has led him astray. This
[1:18:55] is such a beautiful thing the Lord has
[1:18:57] done. Even family that isn't serving the
[1:18:59] Lord has said, "This could only be God
[1:19:02] that turned his life around." I have had
[1:19:05] the most encouraging faith lifting
[1:19:06] moments, knowing that through the loss
[1:19:08] and pain that I have suffered this past
[1:19:10] few months, God still is mindful of my
[1:19:12] requests and desires. This year, I went
[1:19:16] in the prayer line very overwhelmed to
[1:19:18] the point where I literally told the
[1:19:19] Lord, "I'm glad you don't get
[1:19:21] overwhelmed like I do because I'm
[1:19:22] dumping it all out, Lord." I decided I
[1:19:25] wasn't okay with asking one or two
[1:19:27] things. If I was going to ask, I might
[1:19:29] as well take the leap of faith. As the
[1:19:31] saying goes, go big or go home. So many
[1:19:34] so many questions were answered in the
[1:19:36] outpouring of the word. I couldn't get
[1:19:38] enough. My dad always told me, you have
[1:19:41] if you have a question, sincerely pray
[1:19:43] about it and the Lord will answer it in
[1:19:44] the season you need. I am truly thankful
[1:19:47] that the brothers had surrendered
[1:19:49] themselves to the Lord and the truth was
[1:19:52] given in so many different ways that
[1:19:54] I've never comprehended it could be
[1:19:55] said. I overcame anxieties I have
[1:19:58] struggled for the for a good six years
[1:20:00] and I am so thankful to have a clear
[1:20:02] heart and mind over it. I have fully
[1:20:05] accepted my healing that I know the Lord
[1:20:07] has given me throughout the years. And
[1:20:09] I'm grateful to say that today I can
[1:20:11] stand and say I am no longer anemic.
[1:20:14] I no longer have the fears that I'm
[1:20:16] going to have ovarian cysts or that I am
[1:20:19] not going to be able to have children my
[1:20:20] doctors have cleared me. I want to say
[1:20:24] thank you to everyone for your support
[1:20:25] during the past months of every child
[1:20:27] I've been through. I couldn't have done
[1:20:29] it without it. It shows who truly cares
[1:20:32] and has prayed for me. And I want you to
[1:20:34] know that I truly love you and I feel
[1:20:36] your support every single day.
[1:20:39] [Music]
[1:20:46] Amen. Ain't God good?
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Sister Amy,
[1:20:55] bless her, Lord.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; I didn't really prepare anything, but um
[1:21:04] I should have known it was testimony
[1:21:05] service, but I'll check with them.
[1:21:08] But um I just want to I just enjoyed the
[1:21:11] meetings and just really got a renewing
[1:21:15] and you know sometimes you just uh go
[1:21:19] through the motions. I mean you love the
[1:21:21] Lord. Come to church. You know it's the
[1:21:24] right thing to do. It's what you do. You
[1:21:25] know every faithful and you sing songs
[1:21:29] and they're just sometimes they can just
[1:21:31] become just lyrics.
[1:21:33] But um but there just seems like just
[1:21:38] the Lord just gave me a renewing that
[1:21:40] I'm just those are so much more than
[1:21:42] lyrics. just the word just so real, you
[1:21:46] know, and it just um it's good to fill
[1:21:48] your religion sometimes, you know, not
[1:21:50] just
[1:21:52] um just out of duty or
[1:21:57] but so I just thank the Lord for just
[1:21:59] renewing me and just like I said, the
[1:22:02] lyrics are real and all the things
[1:22:04] they've been I've always known
[1:22:05] predestination,
[1:22:07] but when you think
[1:22:09] that there's nothing that can take you
[1:22:12] out
[1:22:13] when you like just the revelation of
[1:22:15] that that
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; it's already done
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; and uh and you can get a little glimpse
[1:22:22] through all the trials and you can get a
[1:22:25] little glimpse of yourself, your name
[1:22:27] that is so precious and I'm so thankful
[1:22:30] that I can see this because there's
[1:22:33] people that come and go and they just
[1:22:36] can't see it and want so bad to just
[1:22:39] somehow open their eyes and just that
[1:22:42] they could see the truth, that they
[1:22:44] could see that God loves them. They
[1:22:45] could see they could receive it. You
[1:22:48] just want to you see that they're in
[1:22:49] chains and bars. It feels like you just
[1:22:54] and and I can see it. I'm so thankful.
[1:22:59] That's just there's no words that could
[1:23:02] ever express the love I have for the
[1:23:05] Lord
[1:23:06] that he's chosen me. And I'm thankful,
[1:23:12] you know, like they were saying in the
[1:23:14] morning, the dancing and beauty for
[1:23:16] ashes and sometimes it's the hardest
[1:23:19] things in our lives that
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; boring and we've seen that, you know,
[1:23:22] with my husband's family, but it's the
[1:23:24] very hardest things that bring that
[1:23:27] sweet smelling savor to the Lord.
[1:23:31] It's nice to be able to see some some
[1:23:34] eyes opening to just uh, you know, to
[1:23:38] know the Lord more.
[1:23:40] So, but I just want to think actually if
[1:23:42] Eliana would come forward.
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:24:04] I can't begin
[1:24:08] to tell you what your love has.
[1:24:12] I'm lost for words.
[1:24:16] [Music]
[1:24:19] Is there
[1:24:21] a way
[1:24:23] to show this in my heart?
[1:24:27] Can I express
[1:24:31] how truly great I think you are?
[1:24:35] My dearest friend,
[1:24:38] [Music]
[1:24:42] Lord, this is my desire
[1:24:50] to pour my love on you.

[1:25:16] till every drop is gone.
[1:25:21] I'll pour my love
[1:25:24] on you.
[1:25:27] [Music]
[1:25:35] I don't know how
[1:25:38] to say exactly how I feel. I can't
[1:25:44] begin
[1:25:46] to tell you what your love has meant.
[1:25:50] I'm lost for words.
[1:25:57] Is there a way
[1:26:00] to show this passion in my heart?
[1:26:05] Can I express
[1:26:08] how truly great I think you are?
[1:26:12] You're my dearest friend,

[1:26:45] with praise like perfume.
[1:26:48] I lavish light on you
[1:26:52] till every drop is gone.
[1:26:56] Lord, pour my love
[1:27:00] on you.
[1:27:06] Like upon your feet,
[1:27:10] like wine for you to drink,
[1:27:14] like water from my heart.
[1:27:17] I pour my love on you.

[1:27:24] I lavish on you
[1:27:28] till every drop is
[1:27:32] pour my love
[1:27:36] on you.
[1:27:41] [Music]
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Did you enjoy that?
[1:27:52] So I throw up my hands,
[1:27:55] praise you again and again.
[1:28:00] All that I have is a hallelujah.
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:08] Hallelujah.
[1:28:12] And I know it's not much, nothing else
[1:28:17] fit for a king.
[1:28:21] Except for a heart seeking highle.
[1:28:25] [Applause]
[1:28:28] [Music]
[1:28:36] Amen. God bless you now.
[1:28:55] Um so I
[1:28:58] I definitely want to thank the Lord for
[1:29:01] his blessings um during the meetings and
[1:29:04] actually for the last few weeks I've
[1:29:07] been so blessed by the services and um
[1:29:11] the preaching and the Lord's really been
[1:29:14] working in my life And um Colton and I
[1:29:18] have really dug into the Bible and and
[1:29:21] started reading
[1:29:23] um the Bible in a year. Um it just
[1:29:26] really has helped us to stay focused and
[1:29:30] um spend
[1:29:33] uh a more special time with the Lord.
[1:29:36] And
[1:29:39] even though all of that these meetings
[1:29:40] were coming up and I was feeling really
[1:29:42] down um just very very fatigued and in
[1:29:47] my in my mind and my body and to the
[1:29:51] point of just tears.
[1:29:54] Um
[1:29:55] and then
[1:29:57] I was I was down um because John had to
[1:30:01] leave again uh for work and and all
[1:30:05] kinds of things. is I mean things like
[1:30:07] my refrigerator went out the night be
[1:30:09] like Thursday night right before church
[1:30:11] and I had all this food and people
[1:30:13] staying with us and you know the
[1:30:15] meetings and the everything that was
[1:30:16] happening and it's just like you know
[1:30:20] little thing after little thing and so I
[1:30:23] was I was pretty down and Thursday night
[1:30:25] I didn't sleep I had a just a piercing
[1:30:28] headache and um all the things that were
[1:30:32] happening and I just I was feeling
[1:30:33] pretty discouraged and the Lord just
[1:30:35] came down and
[1:30:38] by Saturday I had
[1:30:41] I didn't feel so tired anymore and I had
[1:30:43] so much joy coming up in me that I I
[1:30:47] just thank the Lord. I I told him I was
[1:30:50] like I can't get through this weekend
[1:30:51] without you just physically like this
[1:30:53] physical body just can't do it. And um
[1:30:58] he has blessed me so much in in the
[1:31:00] preaching and then just his spirit
[1:31:02] filling him and um even the little bit
[1:31:07] of fellowship
[1:31:08] um was just so special and
[1:31:12] it just meant so much to me. Um the
[1:31:15] prayer line, well, Brother Ronnie's
[1:31:18] sermon about rejoicing just like meant
[1:31:20] so much to me and I just felt that joy
[1:31:23] in my heart. No matter what's going on
[1:31:25] right now, God knows all about it and he
[1:31:27] he's got it so I don't have to worry
[1:31:29] about it. I just felt such a burden
[1:31:31] lift. And um
[1:31:34] and the prayer line, I just went in
[1:31:37] thanking the Lord already. And I
[1:31:42] I know the Lord doesn't have to give us
[1:31:44] these extra confirmations because I
[1:31:47] already have it in me. I already know I
[1:31:49] already know that he loves me and that
[1:31:50] he's with me and that he's taking care
[1:31:52] of all of this.
[1:31:54] But he used a minister that knows
[1:31:56] nothing about me. He doesn't know
[1:31:58] anything that's been going on and he
[1:32:00] just spoke what I was asking the Lord
[1:32:03] for.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; So to me that was just an extra
[1:32:06] blessing. and u very thankful and and
[1:32:10] I'm I'm I'm
[1:32:13] just happy in the Lord.
[1:32:23] [Music]

[1:37:54] fuller,
[1:37:56] sweeter,
[1:37:58] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter as the day.
[1:38:01] Can we take it up?
[1:38:04] Oh, he's sweeter

[1:38:25] fuller,
[1:38:27] sweeter,
[1:38:29] sweeter, sweeter, sweeter.
[1:38:32] days go by.
[1:38:36] Can you say amen to that tonight?
[1:38:39] Amen. God bless. You may be seated. I've
[1:38:42] asked Sister Rose to come and help me
[1:38:45] sing this song. We uh we've been wanting
[1:38:47] to do it as a congregational.
[1:38:49] Brother Ben does it back at his church,
[1:38:51] the honeycomb taste and see. Um I'm not
[1:38:55] sure we'll have her lead it. Amen. Do
[1:38:57] you love him here tonight?
[1:39:01] Amen.
[1:39:04] Oh, sorry. Hey, I'm just dropping the
[1:39:06] ball here tonight. Not paying attention.
[1:39:08] Amen.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not very good at talking in
[1:39:12] front of everybody, but here we go. Um,
[1:39:16] man, I just these meetings were amazing.
[1:39:19] Just so refreshing to me. Just it's like
[1:39:23] this the word.
[1:39:25] I can see myself so clearly in the word
[1:39:29] from cover to cover. That's me. It's
[1:39:32] just so real to me.
[1:39:35] &gt;&gt; And I've had different things going on
[1:39:37] with my in my body. You know, Satan has
[1:39:41] really tried to attack. But but he's a
[1:39:44] liar. And I just
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; thank the Lord that I'm healed.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; You know, I just different things like
[1:39:50] during service when he was praying,
[1:39:53] Satan tried to attack again.
[1:39:55] And I thought, Satan,
[1:39:57] you still haven't had enough, have you?
[1:40:00] I thought, I'm healed. I am healed from
[1:40:04] the top of my head to the soles of my
[1:40:06] feet. And that's like, so be it. It's
[1:40:10] done. There's no question about it,
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; you know, and I just thank you for
[1:40:14] renewing my mind,
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; just renewing my body, and just
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; giving that strength when needed
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; because there's times I thought
[1:40:24] I told Wendell, I said, "I don't know if
[1:40:26] I can go anymore." I said, "I'm just
[1:40:30] worn out, but you know what? God just
[1:40:32] gave me that refreshing and that
[1:40:34] renewing
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; where I can go on. You know, I can make
[1:40:39] it."
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; So those that are different ones I know
[1:40:44] are fighting in their body here also.
[1:40:46] And you know, there is a light at the
[1:40:48] end of that tunnel.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; You know, there is there is hope. You
[1:40:53] know, we never give up
[1:40:56] because, you know, at the end, you know,
[1:40:57] who's going to be on the mountain, who's
[1:40:59] going to be on the who's going to win?
[1:41:02] We are.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; You know, we're winners. You know,
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; I just love the Lord tonight. And I just
[1:41:08] thank him for his love and his mercy
[1:41:10] that he's showed on all of us, you know.
[1:41:14] I just love him.
[1:41:17] [Applause]
[1:41:25] Amen. If you know it, help us sing it.

[1:46:01] And from the mountain to the valley,
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; is he good here tonight? Oh my.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; On my best days and worst ones, he is
[1:46:12] good.
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; And from glory to glory, he is good.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, taste and see.
[1:46:24] that he is good.
[1:46:28] I'm sisfied. I'm sisfied cuz he is good.

[1:46:39] Are you satisfied here tonight? Amen.
[1:46:42] Thank you so much for that. Amen. Oh,
[1:46:45] taste and see that the Lord He is good.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, Brother Joe. Sure
[1:46:51] appreciate the testimonies tonight.
[1:46:53] Amen.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, the meetings were great.
[1:46:58] Exceptional this year. Um, and I don't
[1:47:02] know if y'all don't know that I go
[1:47:04] through a lot of mind battles. Uh, and
[1:47:06] one that's been there for about a year.
[1:47:08] It'll put me under a lot of torment and
[1:47:10] then tell me to kill myself. Has been
[1:47:12] for year, year and a half. And uh, about
[1:47:15] a week before the meetings, I'm like,
[1:47:16] you know, I'm taking you through that
[1:47:18] prayer life.
[1:47:19] I told that devil I said I'm not putting
[1:47:21] up with it no more.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; I was and they started I'm making sure
[1:47:25] I'm going through there. It started
[1:47:26] right before service too started doing
[1:47:28] it again. I said no no I'm going through
[1:47:30] that prayer line
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; and uh I made sure I was one of the
[1:47:33] first ones through there and I haven't
[1:47:36] had that since
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; since the prayer line. I still got the
[1:47:39] torment but he ain't telling me to kill
[1:47:41] myself. I told him one of them's one of
[1:47:43] you is going to go, you know, because
[1:47:46] well, we're all tried and and we're
[1:47:50] we're um that is that how our gold we're
[1:47:53] made, you know. So, I'm learning through
[1:47:56] even the torment.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; I'm learning even more every day. So, if
[1:48:00] that's what I got to go through, I got
[1:48:02] to go through it. But he's not telling
[1:48:03] me to kill myself no more because I'm
[1:48:05] not going to kill myself.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; I'll never taste that.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:11] [Applause]
[1:48:37] What's so funny?
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, you're too slow.
[1:48:46] I'm just glad you let us elders testify.
[1:48:50] I won't be long, but I'm going to go
[1:48:52] back a little ways.
[1:48:56] So young people,
[1:48:58] grandkids, listen up.
[1:49:03] Here in couple of days, I'll be 63.
[1:49:07] That
[1:49:09] makes me still younger than some,
[1:49:12] but older than most.
[1:49:18] It's 1980.
[1:49:22] a 17year-old boy
[1:49:27] in a Baptist barnyard
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; and I heard an eagle scream.
[1:49:37] [Music]
[1:49:42] I accepted that call.
[1:49:47] Brother Matt,
[1:49:50] God made me a living voice.
[1:49:53] Brother Nathan,
[1:49:57] by his grace, brother Zachary,
[1:50:02] I can rejoice,
[1:50:05] Brother Ronnie,
[1:50:08] and rest in my position,
[1:50:10] Brother Zachary. again.
[1:50:13] [Music]
[1:50:16] Then Sunday morning,
[1:50:19] I had it I had it in my my notes I'd put
[1:50:22] down, digging ditches.
[1:50:26] That man of God didn't get up there and
[1:50:28] said, "Dig you some ditches."
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; I was even thought about mentioning it
[1:50:33] before he got out there, but now I know
[1:50:35] why I didn't. God spoke right to me.
[1:50:41] I'd put down long ago. I'd looked it up
[1:50:43] in the scripture. Elisha commanded by
[1:50:45] the thus sayaith the Lord, make this
[1:50:47] valley full of ditches,
[1:50:53] you know, and
[1:50:54] it seems like it's been 45 years. Well,
[1:50:57] it has been 45 years since that day.
[1:51:01] I've been digging my ditch.
[1:51:04] I should have a deeper ditch and a
[1:51:06] bigger ditch.
[1:51:09] So you don't look up to me.
[1:51:13] But like pe like David said, "Yay,
[1:51:17] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:51:19] shadow of death, I'll fear no evil,
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy
[1:51:23] staff, they comfort me."
[1:51:26] I've been in a valley, many valleys.
[1:51:30] this valley
[1:51:33] of death. I all around me,
[1:51:37] my own twin brothers took his life.
[1:51:42] God took my son.
[1:51:46] [Music]
[1:51:48] My daddy died suddenly of a heart
[1:51:50] attack.
[1:51:53] Just this year, my
[1:51:55] 42year-old quadriplegic nephew took his
[1:51:59] last breath.
[1:52:01] [Music]
[1:52:05] But every shovel of dirt which is a is a
[1:52:10] dying out to this flesh.
[1:52:14] my own ideas. God is filled overflowing
[1:52:21] with his word, his life, his spirit.
[1:52:26] And I was reminded of a song,
[1:52:30] Wendy Bagwell and the Sunlighters.
[1:52:33] The tomb is empty,
[1:52:36] but my life is full. You ever heard
[1:52:39] that, Brother Wendell?
[1:52:42] The tomb is empty. Look it up. Listen to
[1:52:44] it. It's a wonderful song.
[1:52:48] That's my testimony today. Though I've
[1:52:51] walked through the valley of the shadow
[1:52:53] of death like David did,
[1:52:56] my life is full. Amen. And I'm rejoicing
[1:53:01] tonight. Amen. Wonder if you if you do
[1:53:03] have the words to uh God on the
[1:53:06] mountain. Amen. I I might be able to see
[1:53:08] it on here. Amen. Let's let's try that.
[1:53:12] in uh in we'll try it in D first. Sister
[1:53:15] Mary,
[1:53:19] life is easy
[1:53:23] [Music]
[1:53:25] when you're up on the mountain
[1:53:31] and you've got peace
[1:53:34] of
[1:53:37] like you've never known.
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:43] But then things change
[1:53:46] and
[1:53:49] you're down in the valley.
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:53:55] Oh, don't lose faith,
[1:53:58] child.
[1:54:00] You're never alone. Would you help me on
[1:54:04] the course?
[1:54:06] For the God on the mountain
[1:54:11] is still God in the valley.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; When things go wrong,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; he'll make them right.
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:28] And the God of the good time
[1:54:33] is still God in the bad time.
[1:54:38] The God of the day
[1:54:43] is still God in the night.
[1:54:49] You talk of faith when
[1:54:54] you're up on the mountain.
[1:54:57] Come on.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; But talk comes so easy
[1:55:04] when life's at its best.
[1:55:09] But it's down in the valley
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; of trials and temptations.
[1:55:18] Oh, that's when faith is
[1:55:23] really put to the test.
[1:55:27] For the God of the mountain
[1:55:32] is my God in the valley.
[1:55:38] When things go wrong, and they will,
[1:55:43] he'll make them right.
[1:55:47] And the God of the good time
[1:55:52] is still God in the bad time.
[1:55:57] The God of the day
[1:56:01] is still God in the night. One more
[1:56:04] time, would you help me? Oh, the God of
[1:56:07] the mountain
[1:56:10] will be your God in your valley.
[1:56:16] when things go wrong. How about it,
[1:56:18] Sister Angie?
[1:56:21] He'll make them right.
[1:56:25] And the God of the good times
[1:56:29] is my God of the bad times.
[1:56:34] The God of the day
[1:56:39] is still God of the night.
[1:56:44] The God of my day
[1:56:48] is still God of the night.
[1:56:54] [Applause]
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; last month I started going through
[1:57:08] reading Daniel. Um, and
[1:57:12] in
[1:57:14] In chapter nine of Daniel, you find
[1:57:16] where uh
[1:57:19] Daniel's gone through his
[1:57:23] his trials. He's seen the miracles and
[1:57:26] now he comes to the point where he
[1:57:29] understands by books the number of years
[1:57:32] where of the word of the Lord came to
[1:57:34] Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[1:57:35] accomplish 70 years in the desolation of
[1:57:37] Jerusalem. and he puts himself
[1:57:42] to prayer and he's, you know, confessing
[1:57:44] the the sins of the nation and
[1:57:47] confessing his own shortcomings and
[1:57:50] going through. And at the end of the
[1:57:53] prayer,
[1:57:56] he prays in verse 19 of Daniel 9, he
[1:58:00] says, "Oh Lord, hear, oh Lord, forgive.
[1:58:04] Oh Lord, hearken and do. Defer not for
[1:58:07] thine own sake, oh God, for thy city and
[1:58:10] thy people are called by thy name.
[1:58:15] And
[1:58:18] his prayer
[1:58:21] struck me as I was going through it last
[1:58:23] month. And um as we went into
[1:58:29] uh as we went into this month, I uh had
[1:58:34] got my family together and I kind of
[1:58:37] gave all of them um a challenge. Um I
[1:58:42] wanted I told them each to get a
[1:58:45] notebook and for this month I wanted all
[1:58:48] of them, me included, to be writing down
[1:58:52] their prayers. Um, you know, there's
[1:58:56] [Music]
[1:58:58] there's something I've I've noticed that
[1:59:01] there can be something different
[1:59:05] when you start to actually write down
[1:59:08] your prayer. Um,
[1:59:10] you know, it's
[1:59:13] just entering into prayer with the Lord
[1:59:14] is great, but there are times when you
[1:59:17] if you take the time and you sit there
[1:59:19] with the pen and paper and you're
[1:59:21] writing down
[1:59:23] And it's almost like you see it in
[1:59:25] permanence in front of you of okay, this
[1:59:27] is the request I'm I'm bringing before
[1:59:30] the Lord. And so I kind of set
[1:59:34] this month that we're we're still in for
[1:59:37] the family to be, hey, we're, you know,
[1:59:39] when we have our our devotion time,
[1:59:41] we're going to be talking about prayer
[1:59:43] and we're going to be going over um
[1:59:45] looking at different prayers in the
[1:59:47] Bible. I want you to be writing down
[1:59:50] your prayers and I want you to be really
[1:59:52] looking at that part of your
[1:59:55] relationship with God.
[1:59:58] And you know, as we went into
[2:00:02] the services, um I had my
[2:00:08] my request that I was writing down
[2:00:10] going, Lord, this is what what I'm
[2:00:12] looking for in in the meetings. And um
[2:00:17] you know, as I think we've heard from
[2:00:19] from multiple other people, um you know,
[2:00:23] I was I was going into these meetings
[2:00:25] tired. Um I was going into these
[2:00:27] meetings um
[2:00:31] not necessarily as excited as I have
[2:00:32] been before. Um
[2:00:35] but I was still going in with, okay,
[2:00:37] Lord, this is these are the things that
[2:00:40] we that I need. Um, and you know, the
[2:00:46] the services were all were all
[2:00:48] excellent. Um, but the the one that
[2:00:53] stood out to me the most was uh, Brother
[2:00:57] Zachary Wallace's. Um, and I I've told a
[2:01:02] couple people, I'm like, I think that
[2:01:04] that was about the best sermon I've ever
[2:01:06] heard him preach. Um, and I mean he had
[2:01:10] a lot of um he had a lot of uh stories
[2:01:15] and a lot of types in there that were
[2:01:17] making things
[2:01:19] stand out on on on different things that
[2:01:22] um there was one thing that that he told
[2:01:25] that was um
[2:01:29] you know and the story with the pig
[2:01:31] stood out a whole lot and different
[2:01:32] things, but when he was telling the
[2:01:34] story about um the the brother with the
[2:01:38] coffee shop and how the brother had seen
[2:01:43] had been reading a quote and then had
[2:01:44] been like um Lord I don't want to
[2:01:49] hold back miracles. I don't want to turn
[2:01:51] down the miracles that you may have for
[2:01:53] me. And um
[2:01:55] it got me looking through through quotes
[2:01:58] and I don't know if this is the exact
[2:02:00] quote that he saw, but it was one that
[2:02:03] kind of stood out to to me as being very
[2:02:06] similar. And um it's in the sermon
[2:02:07] Mary's belief. Brother Random says,
[2:02:09] "Before miracles can take place, the
[2:02:11] Holy Ghost has to come." That's what the
[2:02:14] matter in the world today. They're
[2:02:15] denying the power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:02:18] And um
[2:02:22] as we were
[2:02:24] going into the
[2:02:28] the prayer line on on Saturday night,
[2:02:33] that was
[2:02:35] the prayer that was really starting to
[2:02:37] to echo in my heart was
[2:02:41] Lord, I don't want to turn down
[2:02:44] the miracles that you have for my life.
[2:02:47] Um,
[2:02:49] you know, there are a lot of times that
[2:02:51] I think we can
[2:02:55] start to categorize
[2:02:57] miracles off in this area as, okay,
[2:02:59] someone has cancer, they need a miracle.
[2:03:01] Someone has um this major medical issue,
[2:03:06] they need a miracle. And you know this,
[2:03:10] we start picturing these these really
[2:03:13] big things
[2:03:14] are where miracles happen.
[2:03:17] And we start
[2:03:20] um and we start to
[2:03:24] maybe I'm only maybe I was the only one
[2:03:26] doing this, but we start to restrict God
[2:03:28] and our own lives from giving the small
[2:03:30] miracles.
[2:03:32] And because we look at it and go, that's
[2:03:35] not really big enough. that's not really
[2:03:38] um yes, I know the Lord can do it, but
[2:03:41] goodness, it's nowhere near what this
[2:03:45] family is struggling with or what this
[2:03:47] person is struggling with, and I don't
[2:03:49] really want to bother God with this.
[2:03:50] Maybe it's not a a big enough issue or
[2:03:52] it's not an important enough issue.
[2:03:57] And sometimes it's that we just maybe
[2:04:00] we're a little too focused on the things
[2:04:02] that aren't
[2:04:05] that aren't as important in our life.
[2:04:08] And so we're
[2:04:10] not accepting the miracles God's trying
[2:04:12] to give us because we're focusing on
[2:04:13] well, I want this in my life or I want
[2:04:16] God to do I want God to perform this
[2:04:18] way. I want him to make this happen.
[2:04:21] And
[2:04:23] you know I
[2:04:27] I'd had my different
[2:04:30] prayers written out of of what I
[2:04:34] what I needed and
[2:04:37] you know I've been uh
[2:04:42] blessed to watch my children growing up
[2:04:44] and um
[2:04:47] you know I've been blessed to watch
[2:04:50] Luke growing up and stepping into his
[2:04:53] roles and being able to stand up as as
[2:04:56] more of a man and seeing the Lord work
[2:04:58] in his life and seeing, you know, him
[2:05:00] get the Holy Ghost and seeing him move
[2:05:03] into these realms and go, "Okay,
[2:05:05] Lord, I know that he's still got growing
[2:05:08] to do, but I know
[2:05:11] you've got him. He's got the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:14] He's got that peace. He's
[2:05:18] He's going to keep going. He's going to
[2:05:19] keep pressing on because you've already
[2:05:23] filled him, take care of him. And so
[2:05:27] my heart was really for
[2:05:29] Paul going into these meetings going,
[2:05:32] "Okay, Lord, I need you to take the next
[2:05:34] step with him."
[2:05:36] [Music]
[2:05:37] and
[2:05:39] prayer line started and
[2:05:44] uh you know everybody's coming through
[2:05:46] and the Lord's
[2:05:50] working and touching and
[2:05:53] uh
[2:05:55] it's still always it's still still I'm
[2:05:59] not used to the experience of standing
[2:06:00] where I stand now at the front of the
[2:06:02] prayer line and watching everything as
[2:06:04] it's going on. But um you know, I saw
[2:06:09] Paul as he was coming up through line
[2:06:11] and um you know, as I'm in my role, I'm
[2:06:16] just praying, Lord, I I want you to do
[2:06:19] something for him. I want him to get
[2:06:22] something special out of this. and
[2:06:25] then watching his face as he stepped up
[2:06:29] in
[2:06:31] into the line and seeing the Lord
[2:06:35] working on him and um you know I'm
[2:06:40] not the the one that stands and goes,
[2:06:42] "Oh yes, I know for sure he got the Holy
[2:06:45] Ghost or I know for sure he didn't." or
[2:06:47] whichever one that's between him and the
[2:06:50] Lord. But I can I could stand there and
[2:06:54] I could know for sure, okay, the Lord's
[2:06:55] working on him. Whether he got it in
[2:06:58] that moment, whether it's the start of a
[2:07:00] process for him to get it, I knew that
[2:07:02] it was
[2:07:05] it was the beginning of the answered
[2:07:06] prayer that I had.
[2:07:08] [Music]
[2:07:11] And so after, you know, everyone had had
[2:07:14] gone through the prayer line, after
[2:07:15] everything was was basically done, I I
[2:07:18] stepped over to go through myself.
[2:07:22] And
[2:07:24] that was
[2:07:26] that was the one prayer that I still had
[2:07:29] was just
[2:07:31] Lord, I don't want to be restricting
[2:07:34] you.
[2:07:35] I don't want to be
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; holding back the miracles that you may
[2:07:40] have
[2:07:42] for my life or for my family. Whether
[2:07:46] those are
[2:07:48] spiritual, whether those are physical,
[2:07:50] whether they're financial, what whatever
[2:07:53] it is, I don't want to be standing here
[2:07:56] and going, "Oh, no, Lord. I've got this.
[2:07:59] I can handle it. I can do it on my own.
[2:08:01] I'm
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; I'm smart enough. I'm strong enough. If
[2:08:04] I'm whatever
[2:08:07] Lord, I don't want to be in the position
[2:08:09] where I am
[2:08:11] blocking whatever you have to offer for
[2:08:15] my life.
[2:08:17] And
[2:08:21] all the services were great, all the
[2:08:23] different
[2:08:26] all the ministers speaking and and
[2:08:28] seeing the way it worked. But that was
[2:08:31] just the piece that that I'm walking
[2:08:34] away with. The piece that that really
[2:08:37] grabbed me is going, "Okay, Lord,
[2:08:41] I don't want to stand in your way.
[2:08:44] I know that you're able
[2:08:47] and I know that you have
[2:08:52] better things for me than I can even ask
[2:08:54] for.
[2:08:57] They may not be necessarily what this
[2:08:59] flesh wants. They may not necessarily be
[2:09:01] what uh exactly what I'm thinking you're
[2:09:05] going to do, but I don't want to stand
[2:09:08] in the way of what you're doing in my
[2:09:13] life or in my family.
[2:09:16] [Music]
[2:09:27] Did you enjoy that?
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:31] Amen.
[2:09:34] We're going to sing another song here
[2:09:35] and if we'll make one more call as we're
[2:09:38] get ready to turn to our pastor here
[2:09:40] tonight. Let's turn to G.
[2:09:43] I'm not a prisoner anymore.
[2:09:50] My soul and joy has been restored.
[2:09:58] He broke the chains that once held me.
[2:10:06] The son has made me free indeed.
[2:10:11] Oh, freedom to worship, freedom to
[2:10:14] praise, freedom to walk in his freedom
[2:10:18] ways, freedom to sing, freedom to dance.
[2:10:22] I have been given a second chance. Not
[2:10:26] going back to the enemy's kingdom. I've
[2:10:30] tasted freedom.
[2:10:33] [Music]
[2:10:34] His love destroyed the cage of sin.
[2:10:39] Hallelujah. Are you thankful for that
[2:10:41] tonight? With just one touch I'm do
[2:10:44] again.
[2:10:47] [Applause]
[2:10:49] No longer bound by gu.
[2:10:53] Thank you Lord.
[2:10:56] Each day I let this freedom ring.
[2:11:02] Freedom to worship. Freedom to praise.
[2:11:06] Freedom to walk in his freedom ways.
[2:11:09] Freedom to see, freedom to dance. I have
[2:11:13] been given a second chance. Not going
[2:11:17] back to the enemy's kingdom. I've tasted
[2:11:20] freedom
[2:11:24] as they continue to play that. Just like
[2:11:27] to open the the uh floor one more time
[2:11:30] to to anyone that might have a special
[2:11:32] or a testimony. I've I've enjoyed them.
[2:11:35] I know I keep saying that, but I really
[2:11:37] have enjoyed all the testimonies here
[2:11:38] tonight. Amen. God bless you, brother
[2:11:41] Mitch. Which one? Who wants to go first?
[2:11:45] Amen.
[2:11:47] All right, brother Luke. God bless you,
[2:11:49] Brother Luke. Amen.
[2:12:01] All
[2:12:22] right. Well, uh
[2:12:26] I want to start off by saying uh all the
[2:12:27] meetings were really really good. I
[2:12:32] definitely was blessed. Um
[2:12:36] I'll say uh over the years I have
[2:12:39] developed a lot of different
[2:12:42] insecurities, complexes, had so much
[2:12:46] anxiety over so many different things.
[2:12:52] Uh
[2:12:54] the service were incredible. Like I
[2:12:55] said, um brother Zachary Wallace, he
[2:12:58] preached an incredible sermon. and it
[2:13:00] was absolute masterpiece. But um before
[2:13:03] the Saturday night service, I uh I
[2:13:06] texted Poppy and I'm like, "Hey, do you
[2:13:09] have time to meet and talk before
[2:13:12] church?" And as soon as I saw his truck
[2:13:15] pull up in the parking lot, I
[2:13:16] immediately walked over right next to
[2:13:18] his office and me and him had a little
[2:13:21] chat and I'm like, I've been dealing
[2:13:24] with all these anxieties and
[2:13:26] insecurities and complexes and it such a
[2:13:31] burden, such mental and in some ways
[2:13:36] physical burden.
[2:13:39] Um, we talked and
[2:13:42] brother Ronnie Long, he got up and
[2:13:45] preached and he hit on so many of the
[2:13:49] things I was dealing with and he was
[2:13:51] repeating a lot of the things that Poppy
[2:13:53] had said to me. And um, I will say I've
[2:13:56] never gone through a prayer line before
[2:13:59] where I actually got a blessing until
[2:14:03] that Saturday night. I went through and
[2:14:05] as soon as I walked in, Brother Ronnie
[2:14:08] laid his hands on me and he he started
[2:14:11] praying for the exact things that I
[2:14:12] needed, freedom from anxiety
[2:14:15] and insecurities. And I got through to
[2:14:18] the end and Poppy, he pulled me aside
[2:14:21] and he said that sermon was for you and
[2:14:25] he prayed for me.
[2:14:29] There was such wonderful peace I felt
[2:14:32] from the Lord's touch.
[2:14:36] Sunday morning, Brother Matthew McGary
[2:14:38] got up and he he started on the exact
[2:14:41] same things.
[2:14:44] I just want to thank the Lord for
[2:14:48] giving me freedom from all those
[2:14:51] different things
[2:14:53] and for strengthening my faith.
[2:15:01] [Music]
[2:15:04] All right. This is a song that I haven't
[2:15:06] sang in a while.
[2:15:17] All right. I haven't practiced playing
[2:15:20] this song very many times, so bear with
[2:15:23] me.
[2:15:30] Who am I that you are my me?
[2:15:36] That you hear me
[2:15:40] when I call?
[2:15:42] [Music]
[2:15:45] Is it true that you are thinking of me?
[2:15:51] how you love me.
[2:15:55] It's amazing.
[2:15:59] I am a friend of God.
[2:16:03] I am a friend of God.
[2:16:06] I am a friend of God. He calls me
[2:16:10] friend.

[2:16:20] I am a friend of God. He calls me
[2:16:23] friend.
[2:16:27] Who am I that you are mindful of me?
[2:16:33] That you hear me
[2:16:36] when I call?
[2:16:41] Is it true that you are thinking of me?
[2:16:47] How you love me,
[2:16:51] it's amazing.
[2:16:55] I am a friend of God.
[2:16:58] I am a friend of God.
[2:17:02] I am a friend of God. He calls me
[2:17:05] friend.
[2:17:08] I am a friend of God.
[2:17:12] I am a friend of God.
[2:17:15] I am a friend of God. He calls me
[2:17:18] friend.
[2:17:21] God Almighty,
[2:17:25] Lord of glory,
[2:17:29] you have come.
[2:17:36] God Almighty,
[2:17:39] Lord of glory,
[2:17:42] you have called me friend.
[2:17:49] I am a friend of God.
[2:17:52] I am a friend of God.
[2:17:56] I am a friend of God. He calls me
[2:17:59] friend.
[2:18:02] I am a friend of God.
[2:18:06] I am a friend of God.
[2:18:09] I am a friend of God. He calls me
[2:18:12] friend.
[2:18:15] I am a friend of God.
[2:18:18] I am a friend of God.
[2:18:22] I am a friend of God. He calls me
[2:18:25] friend.
[2:18:30] [Applause]
[2:18:38] I'll stand right here because I'm not
[2:18:40] good at walking right now.
[2:18:43] Um,
[2:18:45] yeah, I just want to say one thing
[2:18:46] first. Uh, Caleb, you know,
[2:18:50] he came back from his grandparents from
[2:18:53] seeing them on vacation and and u, you
[2:18:57] know, it started a couple weeks for me
[2:18:58] before the services. Brother Wendle
[2:19:00] preached one night. So, never give up on
[2:19:02] your family.
[2:19:04] And that's been kind of hard for me at
[2:19:07] times. You know, I'm always been the
[2:19:09] crazy one. Maybe I was crazy when I was
[2:19:13] out in the world, but then God changed
[2:19:15] my life and I still became the crazy one
[2:19:18] with him, you know, and uh
[2:19:22] so it's, you know, it's
[2:19:26] been tough. And then
[2:19:29] just before the meetings, my mom called
[2:19:31] and talked to her and my she said my dad
[2:19:35] had had a stroke. He's had dementia and
[2:19:39] they had called in hospice. He's gone
[2:19:42] down real fast. Um I guess he lost his
[2:19:46] eyesight and just it was going pretty
[2:19:51] fast. And I called the kids together and
[2:19:54] told them and Caleb came to church and
[2:19:57] he sang that song,
[2:20:02] "No grave can hold my body down."
[2:20:05] and
[2:20:07] put his grandfather up
[2:20:10] and talked to my mom
[2:20:15] a couple days later and
[2:20:18] you know the doctors don't really
[2:20:21] really know but they have to explain it
[2:20:23] somehow.
[2:20:24] They said it was most likely staff and
[2:20:29] he was recovering from it. Um
[2:20:33] I think most likely
[2:20:36] God healed him immediately
[2:20:40] and then took that stroke away and he
[2:20:44] started coming back real fast.
[2:20:48] And I'm proud of Caleb for that.
[2:20:52] And
[2:20:54] Luke, it was
[2:20:57] good testimony because that was one I
[2:20:59] was going to give. Anyways,
[2:21:01] I've had anxieties, had complexes all my
[2:21:06] life, especially with the family and
[2:21:09] stuff and growing up. And you carry him
[2:21:11] with you. And when I left, I left
[2:21:15] because of the gospel. God called me and
[2:21:18] I left to do missionary work. And I'd
[2:21:21] never been to church. I'd never done
[2:21:23] missionary work. And so it did seem kind
[2:21:25] of crazy. It was, you know, I didn't
[2:21:29] even know what I was doing, but I left
[2:21:31] and
[2:21:33] u
[2:21:37] family
[2:21:38] still always looked at me as I was
[2:21:41] pretty odd. You know, I had all the
[2:21:45] riches of the world there. I could have
[2:21:47] done whatever I wanted and I left for
[2:21:50] this. And all they see is life's such a
[2:21:54] struggle, you know, financially.
[2:21:58] But you know what?
[2:22:01] They're always fighting to hang on to
[2:22:04] what they got.
[2:22:06] I'm never going to lose what I got.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; I'll never You'll never lose what you
[2:22:12] got.
[2:22:14] And Satan wants to bring it up all the
[2:22:16] time that you're inadequate.
[2:22:20] that you still hold these complexes.
[2:22:23] You're still that same
[2:22:26] thing going on in your head and all that
[2:22:29] stuff. And
[2:22:31] you go through a dry time and you
[2:22:34] struggle. It's been a struggle
[2:22:36] and
[2:22:38] you know every service was building up
[2:22:41] and building up and Saturday night was
[2:22:44] exactly
[2:22:46] talking about complexes and talking
[2:22:48] about you know just it was right there
[2:22:51] the whole time and
[2:22:55] God said you don't need those complexes
[2:22:57] no more.
[2:22:59] He says,
[2:23:02] "With me, all things are possible. Just
[2:23:04] you and me, all things are possible." He
[2:23:08] said, "I still have a work for you."
[2:23:11] And so that's my testimony.
[2:23:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. As we stand to our feet here
[2:23:25] tonight, I sound like a broken record,
[2:23:28] but I've enjoyed it here tonight. And
[2:23:30] we're going to turn it to our pastor.
[2:23:32] Um,
[2:23:36] what
[2:23:40] you want to say?
[2:23:43] Okay, y'all can be seated. Just got one
[2:23:45] more special.
[2:23:47] Amen.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; Don't mean to keep getting you guys up
[2:23:51] and down. Sorry.
[2:23:56] But
[2:24:01] there's something about my grandpa I was
[2:24:02] supposed to say beforehand, but
[2:24:07] quite a few years ago, I don't remember
[2:24:09] how old I was, honestly.
[2:24:12] Me and him had taken a little road trip.
[2:24:14] Uh, I don't know if we were supposed to
[2:24:17] pick up D off or just meet my uncle
[2:24:19] Richie, but
[2:24:22] uh, me and my grandpa went to a
[2:24:24] McDonald's, so I must have been young.
[2:24:27] But he took me through and he's just
[2:24:31] asking me questions like, "So, do you
[2:24:33] really believe all that stuff?" And at
[2:24:36] the time, I was kind of going through a
[2:24:38] phase where I didn't know what I
[2:24:40] believed. I didn't know if I believed
[2:24:42] this. And this is well before I became
[2:24:46] born again as a Christian.
[2:24:49] And he kind of looked at me funny when I
[2:24:52] gave him the answer that I don't know.
[2:24:53] I'm just kind of looking through it all
[2:24:57] that. He's like,
[2:25:00] "Well, it's a good thing. You need to
[2:25:02] stick with it." And back then I kind of
[2:25:05] brushed it off. But
[2:25:08] seeing the kind of man my grandpa is and
[2:25:13] what that would mean to say that to me.
[2:25:17] And it's also why it's been kind of
[2:25:19] tough to see him go from this tall over
[2:25:24] six foot businessman just constantly
[2:25:27] going to work every morning to
[2:25:30] someone who can't even remember who I
[2:25:32] am.
[2:25:34] And
[2:25:37] I just I love my grandpa very much for
[2:25:40] that reason.
[2:25:41] But I know God can do anything. And I
[2:25:45] know that death
[2:25:46] is not the end of it for us and for
[2:25:50] anyone who's even been kind to us, who's
[2:25:52] fed us, clothed us, and everything.
[2:25:55] So I at least know death is not the end
[2:25:58] for him either.
[2:26:00] So God can heal him in any sort of a
[2:26:03] way.
[2:26:05] And
[2:26:07] would you guys uh Brother Wendell and
[2:26:09] Kobe, would you mind helping me sing
[2:26:11] this one? Uh I gave Sister Keys the
[2:26:14] lyrics to it. So
[2:26:26] [Music]
[2:26:29] the Lord
[2:26:38] I say there ain't no grave
[2:26:44] that can hold my body down.
[2:26:50] I say there ain't no grave
[2:26:54] [Music]
[2:26:56] that can hold my body down.
[2:27:02] So when I hear that trumpet sound,
[2:27:06] [Music]
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to rise out of the ground.
[2:27:13] Cuz there ain't no grave
[2:27:19] that can hold my body down.
[2:27:25] Well, fear is a liar with a smooth and
[2:27:30] velvet tongue. Oh, fear is a tyrant.
[2:27:34] He's always telling me to run. Oh, love
[2:27:39] is a resurrection
[2:27:41] and love is a trumpet sound. Yes, love
[2:27:46] is my weapon. I'm going to tear these
[2:27:49] giants down. There ain't no grave
[2:27:54] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:27:58] no grave
[2:28:01] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:28:04] no grave
[2:28:06] [Music]
[2:28:08] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:28:11] no grave
[2:28:14] that can hold my body down.
[2:28:19] Whoa. There was a battle, a war between
[2:28:24] death and life.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; And there on a tree. The lamb of God was
[2:28:30] crucified.
[2:28:32] And he went on down to hell. Oh yeah.
[2:28:36] And he took back every key.
[2:28:39] &gt;&gt; And he rose up as a lion just to set all
[2:28:43] the captive free. Cuz there ain't no
[2:28:46] grave
[2:28:49] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:28:52] no grave
[2:28:55] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:28:59] no grave
[2:29:00] [Music]
[2:29:02] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:29:05] no grave
[2:29:08] that can hold my body down.
[2:29:12] Well, won't you look way down the river
[2:29:17] and what do you think I see?
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; I see a band of angels and they're
[2:29:24] coming after me. I'm singing, "Meet me,
[2:29:28] Jesus, meet me. Won't you meet me in the
[2:29:32] middle of the air?" And I know my wings
[2:29:35] won't fail me, so I can meet you
[2:29:38] anywhere. There ain't no grave
[2:29:43] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:29:47] no grave
[2:29:50] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:29:53] no grave
[2:29:57] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:30:00] no grave
[2:30:03] that can hold my body down. Well, you
[2:30:07] can take me out to the graveyard and you
[2:30:10] can lay my body down, but when Gabriel
[2:30:14] he blows that trumpet, I'm going to get
[2:30:17] up out of the ground. I'm singing meet
[2:30:21] me, Jesus, meet me. Won't you meet me in
[2:30:24] the middle of the air and I'm going to
[2:30:27] rise to meet my Lord? I'm going to say
[2:30:30] goodbye down here. There ain't no grave
[2:30:35] [Music]
[2:30:36] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:30:39] no grave
[2:30:43] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:30:46] no grave
[2:30:49] that can hold my body down. There ain't
[2:30:52] no grave
[2:30:56] that can hold my body down.
[2:30:59] [Music]
[2:31:01] Amen.
[2:31:05] [Applause]
[2:31:07] [Music]
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; Did you enjoy that?
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; So glad we have that promise. There
[2:31:13] ain't no grave.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; If we have to see death, there ain't no
[2:31:16] grave going to hold this body down.
[2:31:18] Amen. But so glad we're looking forward
[2:31:21] to that rapture. I believe could happen
[2:31:23] any time. Amen. Thank you for that.
[2:31:26] Appreciate that. Amen. Can we stand to
[2:31:28] our feet here tonight? And as we get
[2:31:31] ready to turn to our pastors

[2:34:30] [Music]
[2:34:34] Praise the Lord.
[2:34:37] Been a wonderful evening.
[2:34:45] Every testimony was just so wonderful
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; and I'm so thankful to hear what the
[2:34:51] Lord is doing for you in your life.
[2:34:56] And I
[2:34:59] couldn't find the exact quote while ago.
[2:35:01] I was I was trying to scroll on my
[2:35:02] phone,
[2:35:05] but but Brother Brandham would talk
[2:35:07] about how that
[2:35:09] um
[2:35:11] Lot's faith was paralyzed
[2:35:14] because he couldn't see the eternal
[2:35:16] purpose of God. He couldn't see he was
[2:35:20] wrapped up in the in the this and the
[2:35:23] now.
[2:35:25] But he said Abraham and Sarah lived a
[2:35:28] harder life.
[2:35:30] They were they were in a land by
[2:35:32] themselves, misunderstood,
[2:35:36] but their faith was not paralyzed
[2:35:38] because they didn't judge God by the
[2:35:41] circumstances around them.
[2:35:44] And so I would encourage every one of us
[2:35:46] here tonight as we as we leave whatever
[2:35:49] you have received from the Lord,
[2:35:53] don't let the devil paralyze your faith
[2:35:57] in any way. those testimonies that you
[2:35:59] have given, the answers that you have
[2:36:03] received and those that are that are
[2:36:05] believing that the answer is coming.
[2:36:09] Do not start looking at your complexes.
[2:36:12] Do not start looking at your feelings or
[2:36:14] anything else.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; Keep the faith strong.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; Abraham's faith was not paralyzed. Lot's
[2:36:23] faith was paralyzed.
[2:36:25] And so, amen, as as sons of God. And he
[2:36:29] and he and he spoke that. I know what
[2:36:31] tape it's in. It's a good it's a good
[2:36:34] tape even for us to all listen to this
[2:36:36] week. And that's why Christ speak.
[2:36:39] And and brother Brandham was saying
[2:36:42] the word is in the bride. The word is
[2:36:46] there. And and don't let anything
[2:36:50] paralyze that faith. How many believes
[2:36:53] that's a good idea?
[2:36:56] Amen. So,
[2:37:00] we sure enjoyed it. Enjoyed every song.
[2:37:02] I thought all the songs were beautiful
[2:37:05] uh tonight, the specials, the the the
[2:37:07] testimonies. I was blessed. And so, we
[2:37:10] appreciate Brother Kobe uh leading the
[2:37:13] leading the service and and uh we have
[2:37:17] thoroughly enjoyed it. Um praise the
[2:37:21] Lord. Well, we just pray God's blessings
[2:37:22] on every one of you and uh keep on
[2:37:25] pressing the battle and um we we know
[2:37:29] that the rapture is right upon us. I I
[2:37:32] believe it's right upon us. Praise the
[2:37:34] Lord. God richly bless you.
[2:37:37] Uh what are we going to sing as we
[2:37:39] dismiss? Praise the Lord.
[2:37:42] Amen.
