[24:58] Oh, he

[25:12] Healing is here. Oh, healing
[25:16] it's here.
[25:19] Yes, Lord.
[25:22] Healing
[25:24] is here.
[25:30] Oh, he that is here.
[25:35] I receive it
[25:38] and I receive it.
[25:43] I lift my hands. Oh, I lift my hands.
[25:55] my
[26:04] you
[26:06] know my
[26:10] &gt;&gt; I trust in you.
[26:14] Oh glory glory
[26:19] healing is here.
[26:24] Oh yeah,
[26:26] healing
[26:28] is here.
[26:31] Thank you. Thank you. Heing is here
[26:42] and I
[26:44] receive it.
[26:47] Praise the Lord. Aren't you glad for
[26:51] that healing?
[26:53] is the children's bread.
[27:00] And I believe that
[27:03] I believe that as as brother Michael was
[27:08] ministering the other night,
[27:12] you know, they were at Kadesh Barnea and
[27:15] and they had to make their choice. They
[27:18] had to make their choice what what they
[27:20] were going to do. either take God's
[27:23] promise
[27:25] and and die to themselves and because
[27:28] that's what that river Jordan
[27:30] represents, death. Die to
[27:34] all the impossibilities.
[27:37] Go across that land and say, you know,
[27:40] they I I I'm going to possess my land.
[27:44] They didn't have the authority on on
[27:45] that side of the river, but they sure
[27:47] had the authority on this side of the
[27:49] river.
[27:51] And when you have a prophet that comes
[27:52] in and lays it out and says, "This
[27:55] belongs to you." It just makes us want
[27:58] to just gives us confidence and said, "I
[28:01] don't care how big the giant is. Might
[28:04] have to take off the toes first, go to
[28:05] the ankles next, but he's coming down.
[28:07] He's this is my land. This is my
[28:10] promise."
[28:12] And I believe that here tonight.
[28:14] And so I believe healing is here,
[28:18] Brother Borland. It sure is good to see
[28:20] you. Amen. Sight for sore eyes. Amen.
[28:25] And u uh so good to I I was I I was
[28:29] looking at through my text a little bit
[28:31] just before I came out and I I'd seen
[28:33] where I'd missed your text there,
[28:34] brother. Uh it's been a it's been a busy
[28:36] couple days. And so uh but we're sure
[28:39] we're sure glad to have brother Tom with
[28:42] us here tonight. Just good to good to
[28:44] have every Stacia. It's so good to have
[28:46] you and Alba Joe with us.
[28:53] That's an Indian baby. I mean that that
[28:57] baby is uh isn't she just adorable? And
[29:01] so
[29:03] and uh uh we're sure glad to see sister
[29:07] Stacia and and the baby and and so glad
[29:10] y'all are doing well. And um
[29:13] &gt;&gt; how many love Stac Patrick? We just love
[29:17] them.
[29:19] Amen.
[29:23] Well, let's look here in in the Bible.
[29:25] Uh we'll go to the book of Psalms 103.
[29:29] And um we sure uh appreciated
[29:34] the Psalms here tonight. and
[29:38] &gt;&gt; um brother Kobe sort of setting the
[29:42] um setting the stage for the for the the
[29:46] word tonight. I want to minister on
[29:49] healing. And um and so those songs were
[29:54] uh very appropriate.
[29:56] And um Amen. You've already the
[29:59] question's already been asked you, whose
[30:00] report do you believe? And you said, I
[30:03] believe the report of the Lord.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; And so tonight, we want to um deal with
[30:09] with healing for a few moments here this
[30:11] evening. And uh but Psalms 103 and1,
[30:17] bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that
[30:19] is within me, and bless his holy name.
[30:23] Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget
[30:25] not all his benefits.
[30:28] Aren't you glad that you've got benefits
[30:30] in the kingdom of God? Who forgiveth all
[30:33] thine iniquities, who healeth all thy
[30:36] diseases,
[30:38] who redeemth thy life from destruction,
[30:41] who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[30:43] and tender mercies, who satisfies thy
[30:46] mouth with good things, so that thy
[30:49] youth is renewed like the eagles. The
[30:52] Lord execututeth righteousness and
[30:54] judgment for all. Somebody say, for all
[30:58] &gt;&gt; that are oppressed. Amen. And let's go
[31:01] to the Lord in prayer. Father,

[31:49] many ways in our lives.

[32:49] those with those um uh you know kidney
[32:54] stones and and and I mean those things
[32:57] were big enough that the doctor says
[32:59] he's just not going to pass them by
[33:00] himself. And and so um so we're praying
[33:04] for brother Luke and uh they put the
[33:07] stints in, make sure the you know make
[33:09] get just get rid of the any infections
[33:12] and and going to have to come and and um
[33:15] laser those uh bad boys and and um so uh
[33:22] there's there's u some here tonight
[33:26] that's that's been given a um
[33:30] diagnosis of cancer.
[33:32] Uh we've got some We got one liosis of
[33:35] the liver. We've got um you know, you've
[33:38] we've got dad fighting uh that
[33:41] Parkinson's devil. We've got
[33:44] &gt;&gt; So, I mean, we we've got and we could go
[33:47] on. I want to say we thank God for for
[33:50] uh being with Brother Wall-E yesterday.
[33:52] It was a fivehour plus
[33:54] &gt;&gt; uh surgery and God brought him through
[33:57] &gt;&gt; and and we're thankful for that.
[34:00] Um but there's there's a lot of us uh
[34:03] there there's some that's b diabetic
[34:07] um and um you know so in in a in a
[34:10] little congregation like we have there
[34:13] are a lot of needs and I I just I just
[34:17] felt it on my heart as as we um we've
[34:20] got brother Donald who um you know has
[34:23] got that infection in his in his leg and
[34:26] he is uh um I mean It's we need healing.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; We we need healing.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; And and so I I you know I I know it's a
[34:35] Wednesday night, but I just want to I
[34:37] just want to preach a little bit uh on
[34:40] healing.
[34:41] you you you can you can go through and
[34:45] and and um you know you many many say
[34:50] well you know if you're sick then then
[34:52] that means that you know you're being
[34:55] punished or that you're you you've
[34:57] sinned but that's not true that's that I
[35:01] I I believe in some cases that is true
[35:04] for somebody that's backslid and God
[35:06] will God will God will send the hounds
[35:09] of hell after us to uh you know turn us
[35:12] around. I I I believe that. But I also
[35:15] believe that sons and daughters of God
[35:17] who are walking with God and and are
[35:20] under the blood token should be able to
[35:23] come to God without a fear and without
[35:26] any kind of doubt and say Lord I'm I I'm
[35:29] I'm here to accept something that you
[35:31] have given us.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; I think the first thing that we need to
[35:34] understand is this body is not redeemed
[35:37] yet. Your soul is redeemed, but your
[35:39] mind and your body is not redeemed.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; And so what I mean is is the prophet
[35:46] says, "Your body, Amen, Satan can still
[35:49] afflict." Amen. He can't touch that
[35:51] soul. It's seals away. But your body,
[35:54] Amen, is still and your mind is still
[35:58] under uh it can be it can be sick. And
[36:03] uh Amen. we have to believe God for for
[36:06] for healing.
[36:07] &gt;&gt; Others say, "Well, I just I I know God
[36:09] will heal this one, and I know God will
[36:11] heal that, but I just don't know. I just
[36:13] don't know if if he'll heal me." And and
[36:16] and I just say, "We humans, we we just
[36:19] we we just make things weird. We just
[36:21] make things weird. It's not God that
[36:23] makes things weird. We make things
[36:25] weird."
[36:26] &gt;&gt; God says, "I'm the God that health
[36:28] thee."
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? And and so there
[36:33] there's a lot of things there that'll
[36:35] you know you know we can ask and and
[36:37] because we're dealing with ourselves, we
[36:39] know ourselves. We know our our
[36:41] failures. We know our ups and downs. But
[36:43] but I just want to say here tonight,
[36:46] Amen. Those who are under the blood of
[36:49] Jesus are righteous before God.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; You're righteous because he has made you
[36:56] righteous.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and as we as we sing the
[37:00] song, Jesus has a table spread where the
[37:04] saints of God are fed. He invites his
[37:07] come his chosen people to come and dine.
[37:10] And I I I say I I I want to come and
[37:13] dine. Amen. If God's got something for
[37:15] me that I I I I want to sit at his
[37:18] table. Well, can you say amen?
[37:20] &gt;&gt; I don't want to just sit around and
[37:21] wish. I want to sit up at the table.
[37:23] Brother Brandham says, "If I went to
[37:25] your table and sat down and and you
[37:27] said, "Preacher, come eat with me. I
[37:29] believe you love me." Amen. I you you
[37:32] had beans and potatoes and carrots and
[37:34] fried chicken and pumpkin pie and ice
[37:36] cream and everything sitting there.
[37:38] Well, I believe I just I' I'd be just as
[37:42] welcome to the potatoes as to the beans.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:45] &gt;&gt; The The only thing I believe Amen. I'
[37:48] I'd be just as welcome to the chicken a
[37:51] as as to the pie. It's all on the table.
[37:54] The only thing that I have to say is
[37:56] would you please pass me some pie?
[38:00] &gt;&gt; I I I believe with a good free heart if
[38:04] you if if you love me you would say
[38:07] certainly my brother have a nice big
[38:10] piece of it. Is that right? If I'd say
[38:13] would you pass me potatoes? Why
[38:15] certainly my brother? Here it is. Every
[38:18] redemptive blessing that Jesus Christ
[38:21] died for and purchased in his atonement
[38:25] at Calvary is sitting at the table
[38:28] tonight.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:32] And every believer is sitting before it.
[38:35] Hallelujah. He said, if I need healing,
[38:38] I say, "Father, pass me some healing."
[38:41] And I pour it out on the plate and eat a
[38:44] big a thing of it. Can you say amen?
[38:47] Amen. That's right. I How many believes
[38:50] that healing is the children's bread?
[38:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says, "Of course, any
[38:54] Christian believes that that there would
[38:56] be a resurrection. But if there's no
[38:59] attributes of the resurrection, if
[39:01] there's no earnest of the resurrection,
[39:03] then there is no resurrection. And if
[39:06] there's no divine healing, there is no
[39:10] resurrection."
[39:11] Amen. You couldn't disprove that if if
[39:14] uh if you could by the scripture. I'm
[39:16] arguing the points of Christ. See,
[39:18] because we have the earnest of our
[39:21] salvation, which is the baptism of the
[39:23] Holy Spirit. Is that right? That's the
[39:25] down payment, the earnest which holds it
[39:28] secure in heaven for us. Then if there
[39:30] is no divine healing to make a
[39:33] cancerridden body come normal and well
[39:35] again, there is no resurrection of the
[39:38] dead. That's right. We have no earnest
[39:41] of it at all. THERE'S NO PLAN MADE FOR
[39:44] it at all. Amen. So that WOULD THAT JUST
[39:46] SADDLES IT. SO BROTHER RANDOM is saying,
[39:48] "Amen, get in your mind. If we're
[39:50] believing in a in in in an eternal
[39:53] a a resurrection and and and a heaven,
[39:56] then you'd better believe that healing
[39:58] is yours." And if you CAN'T BELIEVE IN
[40:00] HEALING, THEN DON'T EVEN EXPECT AMEN.
[40:03] You It's It's all a fairy tale to you.
[40:05] Amen. That's what he's saying. Amen. If
[40:07] we don't have healing, he says, then we
[40:10] have no earnest at all. There's no plan
[40:12] for it. So, that settles it. But I say
[40:15] tonight, there's somebody that says
[40:16] there is healing for me. AMEN. BUT THERE
[40:19] MUST BE A faith to appropriate to it.
[40:22] And I'm just going to talk to you from
[40:24] my heart here tonight. There's got to be
[40:26] faith THAT APPROPRIATES THAT HEALING.
[40:30] GOD can do no more for you than what
[40:33] he's already done at Calvary. How many
[40:36] believes that here tonight? Amen. The
[40:38] promises of God are are sure. AMEN. THE
[40:42] PROMISES of God are are real and they're
[40:46] and they have been given to every one of
[40:48] us. Amen. That there the Bible says that
[40:51] the that that that the words are life to
[40:54] them that find it and it's health to all
[40:58] their flesh. There in Exodus 23 and 25.
[41:02] Ye shall serve the Lord your God, and he
[41:05] shall bless thy bread and thy water, and
[41:08] I will take away from a sickness away
[41:13] from the midst of thee. Hallelujah. Now,
[41:16] you can't go into this thing presuming.
[41:19] Presuming is to Amen. IS TO SUPPOSE
[41:22] SOMETHING IS THE case based on
[41:25] probability. Amen. So, I presume, Amen.
[41:28] that that that healing could BE FOR ME
[41:31] BECAUSE THE PREACHER HAS PREACHED AND I
[41:33] HAVE SEEN PEOPLE HEALED. YOU SEE THAT'S
[41:36] PRESUMING BUT A HEART OF FAITH IS NOT
[41:39] LOOKING FOR A HOPE. SO a heart OF FAITH
[41:42] SAYS GOD DIED FOR ME.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; JESUS PAID THE PRICE FOR ME. HIS STRIPES
[41:49] WERE PUT ON HIM for me. Can you say
[41:53] amen? Hallelujah. Brother brother Bradom
[41:56] says Moses never went down into Egypt
[41:58] presuming that God was with him. He went
[42:02] DOWN TO EGYPT KNOWING GOD WAS WITH HIM.
[42:06] YOU DON'T ACCEPT YOUR HEALING thinking
[42:09] God will heal you or do it. You accept
[42:13] your healing because GOD HAS ALREADY
[42:16] SOMEBODY SAY ALREADY DONE IT.
[42:19] HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NOT THINKING HE'S
[42:22] GOING TO DO IT. It's in the past tense.
[42:24] Healing has been paid for. HEALING IS
[42:27] SETTING AT THE TABLE. YOU JUST GOT TO
[42:29] GET YOUR NAPKIN, YOUR FORK, AND YOUR
[42:31] SPOON AND SAY, "PASS IT OVER TO ME. I'M
[42:34] READY TO EAT."
[42:36] &gt;&gt; OH, can you say amen? IT AIN'T WHETHER
[42:38] YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH. IT AIN'T WHETHER IT
[42:40] DON'T MATTER YOUR FAMILY STATUS. IT
[42:42] DON'T MATTER WHAT WHAT WHAT YOU ARE IN
[42:44] THE COMMUNITY. IT'S WHAT YOU ARE IN
[42:47] HEAVEN. AND I WANT TO TELL YOU, EVERY
[42:49] ONE OF YOU HAVE A blood atonement.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:55] Healing has been paid for for you.
[42:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. It's already
[43:00] DONE IT. HE'S PROMISED IT AND YOUR FAITH
[43:03] SAYS IT'S SO AND NOTHING ELSE CAN WIPE
[43:06] it out. And I say amen to it.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; James 1 and6. But let him ask in faith
[43:12] nothing wavering. For he that waverth is
[43:15] like a wave of the sea driven with the
[43:18] wind and tossed. FOR LET NOT THAT man
[43:21] think that he shall receive anything of
[43:23] the Lord. For a double-minded man is
[43:27] unstable in all his ways. AMEN. SO, SO I
[43:32] WELL, I you better watch out. You're
[43:35] fixing to fall. Amen. No, no, no, no,
[43:38] none of this guessing, none of this
[43:40] wishy-washy. Either God's word is right
[43:42] or it's wrong.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; EITHER JESUS PAID FOR YOUR SINS or he
[43:47] didn't. And either his his stripes was
[43:51] laid stripes were laid on his back for
[43:53] your healing or it wasn't. Well, glory
[43:55] to God.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just going to keep laying
[43:58] scripture in here for a while. How many
[43:59] how many believe that's all right? Amen.
[44:01] Hebrews 11 and6. Without faith, it is
[44:05] impossible to please him. For he THAT
[44:09] COMES TO GOD MUST BE DOUBLEMINDED.
[44:15] MUST THINK THAT MAYBE ONE OF THESE days
[44:18] God's going to heal me.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; NO. HE THAT COMETH TO GOD MUST BELIEVE
[44:25] THAT he is
[44:28] &gt;&gt; and that he is a rewarder of them who
[44:31] diligently seek him. Can you say amen? I
[44:35] I I believe that we're living in the day
[44:37] of the returning to the inheritance.
[44:39] We're not in Egypt. We're not in the
[44:41] wilderness of denominationalism.
[44:43] We have been given a word of promise.
[44:47] Satan has said we can't have it. Satan
[44:50] took it away from Adam and from Eve. AND
[44:52] ALL OF THE ADAM'S RACE IS JUST STRUGGLE.
[44:55] BUT I'M HERE TO TELL YOU, WE ARE GOING
[44:58] TO A LAND and divine HEALING HAS COME TO
[45:02] US TO LET US KNOW. You know what? You
[45:06] know what divine healing is? It's the
[45:07] grapes of the other land.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; It's the grapes. It's the pomegranates.
[45:12] It's the proof. Amen. It's the proof
[45:15] that the other land exists. IT'S IT'S
[45:18] IT'S GOD SAYING, "OH, here I'm going to
[45:21] give you I'm going to let you eat a
[45:23] juicy grape." So, just so that you know,
[45:25] Amen. what it's going to be like on the
[45:27] other side.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Well, there ain't going TO BE NO
[45:30] SICKNESS ON THE OTHER SIDE. There ain't
[45:32] GOING TO BE NO DISCOURAGEMENT ON THE
[45:34] OTHER SIDE. THERE AIN'T GOING TO BE NO
[45:36] BACKSLIDING ON THE OTHER SIDE. SO, WE
[45:38] MIGHT AS WELL just start believing it
[45:40] right now.
[45:42] Hallelujah. Well, glory to God. Amen.
[45:46] Now, if there's ever a day that we need
[45:47] to believe healing for our minds, we
[45:50] need healing in our minds.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Listen, friends, this this this
[45:54] generation is is struggles in our minds.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; It's an onslaught of hell. The the the
[46:00] lid of hell has come off. Amen. Hell is
[46:03] everywhere. And it's not just touching
[46:05] those people outside there. It'll affect
[46:08] you right here. YOU BIBLEBELIEVING GODLY
[46:11] PEOPLE, SATAN WILL AFFLICT YOUR MIND.
[46:13] HE'LL AFFLICT YOUR BODY
[46:15] &gt;&gt; and he'll make you think that YOU'RE THE
[46:17] MOST WORTHLESS THING THAT EVER THAT EVER
[46:19] COME ON PLANET EARTH.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. ANYMORE, I just agree WITH
[46:23] HIM. YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT I'VE GOT A LAMB
[46:26] who has given me his righteousness.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; I don't even argue with him anymore. Why
[46:31] can't you say amen? That's right. AMEN.
[46:33] SATAN IS THERE A A PLAGUE IN OUR MINDS.
[46:36] DEMON INFILTRATION OF OUR minds and of
[46:40] our heart. But I'm I I I'M HERE TO TELL
[46:42] YOU THIS IS WHAT THE scripture says
[46:44] there in 1 Thessalonians 5:23. And the
[46:47] very God of peace sanctify you holy AND
[46:51] I PRAY GOD your whole spirit. Somebody
[46:55] say spirit
[46:57] &gt;&gt; AND SOUL
[46:58] &gt;&gt; and well are y'all going to help me on
[47:00] this. I PRAY GOD your whole spirit. YOUR
[47:04] WHOLE SOUL AND YOUR BODY BE PRESERVED
[47:09] blameless
[47:12] &gt;&gt; until the coming of our Lord Jesus
[47:14] Christ.
[47:15] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and forget
[47:18] not all his benefits, who forgiveth thee
[47:22] of all thine iniquities, and healeth
[47:25] thee OF ALL. SOMEBODY SAY ALL.
[47:30] ALL THY DISEASES. WELL, I'M GETTING TOO
[47:33] OLD. It don't matter HOW OLD YOU ARE.
[47:35] THERE IS NO EXCEPTION. THERE IS NO
[47:38] CLAUSE UP TO 60 years old OR UP TO 40
[47:42] years old. The Lord has delivered YOU
[47:46] FROM ALL YOUR INIQUITIES AND HE'S HEALED
[47:49] YOU OF ALL THY DISEASES.
[47:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Can you say amen, man?
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Does he forgive? DOES HE STILL FORGIVE
[47:59] INIQUITIES?
[48:01] &gt;&gt; Then he still heals all our diseases.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; What about the Amen. Does the Lord still
[48:08] heal? Amen. Oh yes. I mean he he look
[48:12] look at what God done even in the New
[48:13] Testament. Amen. We we see the angel
[48:16] coming down on the pool of Bethesda
[48:18] would stir that water at a certain
[48:21] season. Hallelujah. And what was it all
[48:24] to do? To provide healing. The angel
[48:27] would come down to the pool and trouble
[48:29] the waters. And whoever would go into
[48:32] that, Amen. pool, the first to go in
[48:34] would be healed.
[48:36] Amen. Israel in the wilderness. Amen.
[48:38] When sickness would come because of
[48:40] their sin, GOD WOULD SAY, "I am the God
[48:44] that heal thee."
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? AMEN. WHAT CAUSED
[48:50] SICKNESS in the FIRST PLACE? WHAT CAUSED
[48:52] DEATH? WHAT CAUSED DEATH? AMEN. Sin
[48:56] cause death.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and and THERE IF IF THERE
[49:00] IF THERE WAS NO SIN, THERE WOULD BE NO
[49:04] SICKNESS. THERE WOULD BE NO DISEASE and
[49:07] there would BE NO DEATH.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; BUT BECAUSE SIN CAME, AMEN. death reigns
[49:13] in our bodies and that brings sickness
[49:16] and and and and hardships. Can you say
[49:19] amen?
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 5:12. Wherefore, as by one
[49:24] man sin uh uh by one man sin enterth
[49:28] into the world, AND DEATH BY SIN, AND SO
[49:32] DEATH IS passed upon all men, for that
[49:36] all have sinned.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; We've all sinned.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; WE ALL GET SICK.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; WE ALL FIGHT MIND BATTLES.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; WE ALL DO these things.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Well, can you say amen? Rich, POOR,
[49:54] &gt;&gt; nobles and peasants.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. WE WE WE ALL FIGHT IT. CAN
[49:59] YOU SAY AMEN? But I but I I I I just
[50:01] want to tell you, Amen. Hallelujah. I'm
[50:04] so glad that there's a remedy.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; DISEASE IS IS THE PHYSICAL penalty of
[50:12] iniquity. The day you eat of the fruit,
[50:16] you shall surely die.
[50:19] That's spiritually and physically.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So, so, so where or or
[50:26] who DOES DOES SICKNESS COME FROM? Does
[50:30] it come from God?
[50:32] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[50:33] &gt;&gt; Well, hallelujah.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; Go ahead.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Does sickness come FROM GOD?
[50:37] &gt;&gt; NO. SICKNESS DON'T COME FROM GOD. THE
[50:39] BIBLE SAYS uh uh there in in in Acts 10,
[50:43] I I believe it's Acts 10 and 36. Amen.
[50:47] and how 30 36 and 38 how that God
[50:50] anointed Jesus, amen, of Nazareth and UH
[50:54] HOW GOD ANOINTED JESUS OF NAZARETH WITH
[50:57] THE Holy Ghost and with POWER WHO WENT
[51:00] ABOUT doing good and healing
[51:05] &gt;&gt; ALL THAT WERE OPPRESSED OF THE DEVIL.
[51:08] For God was with him.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; So you ain't got fighting himself.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. IT'S NOT IT'S NOT GOD FIGHTING
[51:16] HIMSELF. IT'S GOD FIGHTING THE ENEMY.
[51:19] GOD BROUGHT JESUS CHRIST TO HEAL YOU
[51:23] BODY, SOUL, AND SPIRIT.
[51:27] &gt;&gt; WELL, I hope you're getting that in your
[51:28] mind right now. Get it anchored. Get it
[51:30] lodged. Get it right now in your mind
[51:32] because I believe God could do a miracle
[51:34] in your body right now hearing the word
[51:36] of God.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Hallelujah. Amen.
[51:41] All that were oppressed of the devil. So
[51:43] sickness is the consequence of sin. If
[51:49] there had been no sin, there would be no
[51:53] sickness. SO IF YOU DEAL WITH THE SIN
[51:57] QUESTION, THEN YOU HAVE THE FAITH TO
[52:01] come and ask for healing.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; IF YOUR SOUL IS REDEEMED, THEN WHY CAN'T
[52:07] I believe God? Amen. To touch my body.
[52:10] Yeah,
[52:11] &gt;&gt; I I remember uh uh uh you know, Sister
[52:14] Stephanie coming in and and there she
[52:16] was a a druggie, been a druggie, you
[52:18] know, a long time. We all know the story
[52:19] that you know, she I mean, she she done
[52:21] drugs since she was uh in her pre-teens
[52:24] and and uh uh you know, and and and and
[52:27] her mom died at an early age, you know,
[52:29] just just you know, just uh drug related
[52:32] and things of that nature. And here we
[52:34] we seen Stephanie, you know, close to 40
[52:37] years old. Amen. and her teeth were all
[52:39] all rotten and she was just as skinny as
[52:42] could be and Amen. and and and and you
[52:45] know called herself an atheist and and
[52:48] you know she didn't know anything about
[52:49] anything you know. Amen. But but when
[52:52] God touched Sister Stephanie Hallelujah.
[52:56] Now this she just started believing.
[52:58] Hallelujah. you know, she'd come over
[53:00] where I was working and I' I'd tell I',
[53:02] you know, I'd go get in the car with her
[53:04] and Fresca and talk about Daniel and oh,
[53:07] she just loved it hearing about Daniel
[53:09] in the lion's den or about Abraham and I
[53:12] would tell her about Abraham and how we
[53:14] we are the royal seed of Abraham. Just
[53:16] give her little stories AND SHE JUST WOW
[53:19] WOW wow and uh Amen. But but see when
[53:23] she came, she came with a bad liver and
[53:26] and so things started getting uh really
[53:29] getting bad. And of course they they
[53:30] were living on the streets when they had
[53:32] came. They didn't have anything but just
[53:33] the the clothes on their back. And so uh
[53:37] uh YOU KNOW SHE SHE DIDN'T SHE DIDN'T
[53:39] HAVE no she she really didn't have any
[53:41] righteousness to come and bring before
[53:43] God. Stephanie had nothing. Right? Y'all
[53:47] remember when Sister Stephanie was
[53:49] saved? Well, here here she comes. Amen.
[53:52] And so she told me that they were going
[53:53] to, you know, going to the doctor and
[53:55] and uh well, the doctor wasn't too
[53:57] proud, you know, just, you know, she
[53:59] told the doctor she's she's she's doing
[54:01] good now and she's giving her heart to
[54:02] the Lord. And the doctor's going, "Yeah,
[54:04] yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I've seen
[54:05] your kind before. You're a druggie.
[54:07] You've done this to your body." And
[54:09] amen. Cuz cuz they were hoping to get
[54:10] put on for for, you know, uh the uh the
[54:13] the the
[54:14] transplant. And uh you know uh uh the
[54:17] doctor just she said I'm not going for
[54:19] it. You're you know you're just it it
[54:21] you know there's going to be other
[54:23] people who genuinely need livers and and
[54:25] you're just going to go back out there
[54:27] and keep on playing around and and she
[54:29] tried to tell her, you know, I'm I'm
[54:31] really I'm a Christian now. I'm not I
[54:33] don't do that stuff anymore. Heroin is
[54:36] is behind me. And and and she she done
[54:38] heroin for uh for for many years, 30
[54:42] years. AND AND SO HERE BUT BUT she
[54:46] believed the Lord
[54:48] &gt;&gt; and and so she goes, y'all remember the
[54:50] story how she goes back to the doctor.
[54:52] Amen. And you know the doctor had given
[54:54] her some medication and telling her what
[54:56] she needs to eat and so this that and
[54:58] the other. She goes back in has has the
[55:00] next test run and and the doctor comes
[55:03] back in and says there is nothing wrong
[55:07] with your liver. Your liver
[55:10] &gt;&gt; there's no cerosis.
[55:13] There's nothing there. Well, well, now
[55:17] look at that. She She had She had
[55:20] nothing.
[55:22] SHE HAD NOTHING GOING FOR HER.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; She couldn't come in and say, "But Lord,
[55:26] I've saved this many people and I've
[55:27] come to church for this many years, and
[55:29] I She'd only She'd only been in church
[55:31] for a few months.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God." You see, IF WE WOULD
[55:35] JUST COME AND just believe God,
[55:38] &gt;&gt; JUST BELIEVE GOD, THAT'S ALL GOD WANTS.
[55:41] HE JUST WANTS FAITH IN HIS WORD. FAITH
[55:44] IN HIS WORD. STEPHANIE'S NOW NOW BEEN
[55:46] SERVING THE LORD FOR 10 YEARS AND SHE'S
[55:48] JUST AS HEALTHY AND AMEN. AND AND AND
[55:50] AND AND GOD DONE A GREAT WORK IN HER
[55:52] LIFE, RIGHT?
[55:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. How we LOVE SISTER STEPHANIE AND
[55:58] BROTHER JOE. GOD. BUT YOU SEE, IT WAS
[56:00] SOMEBODY THAT KNEW THAT THERE WAS
[56:03] NOTHING THEY COULD DO TO EARN IT. THEY
[56:06] JUST SIMPLY BELIEVE THE PLAN OF
[56:09] SALVATION. JESUS DIED FOR DRUGGIES AND
[56:14] DRUGGIES THAT JESUS DIED FOR HAD A RIGHT
[56:17] TO BELIEVE FOR HEALING.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. You see, we sit
[56:24] around and we we think, well, but I had
[56:26] that thought yesterday and I had I said
[56:28] I misspoke two days ago and I I just
[56:31] don't know. Why don't we get rid of that
[56:32] mental attitude and just say, God, I am
[56:35] forever yours. You have sanctified me
[56:38] forever through the BLOOD OF JESUS
[56:40] CHRIST. I CAN STAND HERE AND BELIEVE
[56:43] YOU. I AM GOING ACROSS THAT JORDAN RIVER
[56:48] AND I'M GOING TO POSSESS MY MOUNTAIN.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's look at the blood for a
[56:57] moment. Amen. The blood, the covenant of
[56:59] the blood. Atonement means to cover
[57:01] over. Atonement means to make
[57:03] reconciliation.
[57:05] It means to atone for by legal rights.
[57:09] It means to pacify or satisfy the judge.
[57:13] Are y'all hearing me? So only the blood
[57:17] could satisfy the courts of heaven. God
[57:21] was the first to slay a lamb IN THE
[57:23] GARDEN. GOD WAS THE FIRST TO SLAY A
[57:26] LAMB. WELL, glory to God. YOU KNOW WHY?
[57:29] BECAUSE HIS CHILDREN MADE A FLUB of
[57:31] themselves and they couldn't redeem
[57:34] themselves. And God,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; ADAM DIDN'T EVEN ASK FOR A LAMB. GOD
[57:41] GAVE A LAMB. IT WAS GOD'S HEART ASKING
[57:44] OR WANTING TO GIVE REDEMPTION.
[57:46] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Adam was guilty.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; And he knew it. And he just had his head
[57:52] hung in shame. And he had Amen. He was
[57:55] walking out of the garden.
[57:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, he was.
[57:59] &gt;&gt; And God was God's heart was breaking.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; Says, "Adam, wait. Wait, wait. It was
[58:05] God running after Adam. Adam was doing
[58:08] the hiding. God was doing the searching.
[58:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God. Glory. When it's
[58:18] it's when WHEN WHEN YOU'RE OVER THERE IN
[58:20] YOUR LITTLE PITY PARTY AND SAY, "I WISH
[58:22] I DIDN'T AND I WISH I COULD AND I WISH
[58:24] AND I WISH." GOD IS LOOKING FOR YOU.
[58:27] SAY, "LISTEN, YOU MEAN EVERYTHING TO
[58:30] ME."
[58:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:33] That's good.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[58:39] &gt;&gt; So, God was the first to slay a lamb.
[58:44] Abel was the first human to offer blood
[58:47] back to God.
[58:49] Adam slew a lamb when he met God. Noah
[58:53] offered a lamb up to God after the
[58:55] flood. The Passover night in Egypt
[58:59] required blood. Aaron the HIGH PRIEST.
[59:03] AMEN. HAD TO HAVE BLOOD TO enter into
[59:05] the holiest. Well, can you SAY AMEN?
[59:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, WHAT HAPPENS to your sin
[59:12] when the sin question is dealt with?
[59:18] &gt;&gt; I'm glad you asked that. Hallelujah.
[59:21] What happened to my sin?
[59:29] It's placed in the sea.
[59:32] Hallelujah.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Of God's forgetfulness.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh my goodness. It it Well,
[59:41] glory to God. Amen. You can take You can
[59:44] take now, you know, they don't make
[59:45] things as powerful as they used to.
[59:48] Amen. But but uh uh you know these these
[59:50] chemicals and things but but you do the
[59:53] you know you get the bleach and and and
[59:54] and you could drop a little drop of of
[59:57] ink into that bleach and then you you
[59:59] you can just watch it going every which
[1:00:01] direction. What what is it? Amen. The
[1:00:04] chemical in the bleach is more powerful
[1:00:06] than the stain in the ink.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now now these days bleach is
[1:00:13] a lot like religion. It only just
[1:00:14] muddles it up. But Amen. Back in back
[1:00:17] back when they used to clean stuff when
[1:00:19] my mama used to clean it, you'd be able
[1:00:21] to you couldn't walk into that bathroom
[1:00:23] for two weeks after she cleaned it.
[1:00:24] Hallelujah. It stunk so bad. Amen. Well,
[1:00:27] that's the way that's the way the blood
[1:00:30] of Jesus CHRIST NOW THE BLOOD. AMEN.
[1:00:32] NOW, now now the church has muddled it
[1:00:34] all up. It's muddled it all up. Amen.
[1:00:37] and and and so you drop your little sin
[1:00:39] and that that little um church
[1:00:41] forgiveness and all of that and you look
[1:00:44] and all you can see is just a bunch of
[1:00:46] black liquid everywhere. Hallelujah. But
[1:00:50] the BLOOD OF JESUS IS LIKE THE OLD
[1:00:53] BLEACH. HALLELUJAH. THAT OLD STUFF, YOU
[1:00:56] COULD DROP THAT INK IN THERE.
[1:00:58] HALLELUJAH. AND IT THAT INK HAS LOST ITS
[1:01:03] POWER FOREVER. IT IT IT REMOVES THE
[1:01:07] POWER OF STAIN. IT REMOVES EVERYTHING.
[1:01:10] AMEN. TAKES IT BACK TO WELL, are y'all
[1:01:12] hearing me?
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; And you get the your the blood. Amen.
[1:01:15] You get your sins, I don't care. The
[1:01:17] Bible says, "Though your sins be a
[1:01:19] scarlet," Amen. Though you have BEEN
[1:01:22] DIRTY WRONG, HALLELUJAH. IT SHALL BE
[1:01:26] WHITE LIKE SNOW.
[1:01:31] GOD CAN TAKE AWAY YOUR SIN ALL THE WAY
[1:01:34] BACK TO WHERE YOU FIRST COMMITTED YOUR
[1:01:37] FIRST SIN. AMEN. THAT AGE OF
[1:01:39] ACCOUNTABILITY. AND SOMETIMES WE GO ALL
[1:01:42] THE WAY BACK AND WE CAN REMEMBER WHERE
[1:01:44] WE FIRST DONE IT. WE CAN REMEMBER WHERE
[1:01:47] IT SCARRED OUR HEART. BUT I'M HERE TO
[1:01:49] TELL YOU, JESUS BLOOD CAN TAKE AWAY ALL
[1:01:53] THOSE SCARS.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:01:58] NOW,
[1:02:02] WELL, praise the Lord.
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; If there's no sin held against you,
[1:02:09] you say, "But there is sin in my life.
[1:02:11] There is mistakes." Then you, you know,
[1:02:13] then
[1:02:17] you need to really check yourself
[1:02:18] because if you don't believe you're
[1:02:19] saved and you don't believe that Jesus
[1:02:22] blood has enough power,
[1:02:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; to save you, you you you better check
[1:02:26] your soul. Make sure you've got your
[1:02:28] ticket ready to go.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Cuz I'm here to tell you, the blood of
[1:02:35] Jesus has enough power to forgive your
[1:02:38] past sins, your present sins, and your
[1:02:42] future sins.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; And if he does not hold sin against you,
[1:02:48] then what is there to keep you from
[1:02:50] being healed?
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:02:57] Now,
[1:02:58] so who can who can remove that curse?
[1:03:00] The doctor can assist nature. Amen. But
[1:03:03] only God can heal.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; The doctor can set the bones, but only
[1:03:07] God can heal the arm.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; They can remove the cancer, but only God
[1:03:12] can bring the healing. Amen. Well,
[1:03:15] praise the Lord. Yeah.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; All of your vitamins and minerals and um
[1:03:21] all of your oils can can
[1:03:25] Hallelujah. They can they're okay in
[1:03:27] assisting nature. Hallelujah. But I'm
[1:03:30] here to tell you, your vitamins and your
[1:03:32] minerals and your oils cannot bring
[1:03:34] healing. It requires God.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:03:40] You can eat your veggies every day of
[1:03:42] your life. Hallelujah. and you're still
[1:03:44] going to be end up diseased.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; But I'm so glad that there is a God who
[1:03:48] heals our diseases.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; So I'm saying here tonight, there's only
[1:03:54] one cure, one cure.
[1:03:58] And and and I want us to as as as Israel
[1:04:01] was a type, amen, of the believer, it
[1:04:05] required the blood.
[1:04:08] And they had to take the blood, put it
[1:04:10] on the post, and they had to eat the
[1:04:12] lamb. It was the very first communion
[1:04:15] service there in Exodus 12. Amen. Where
[1:04:18] the blood was to be applied. And the
[1:04:21] death angel that was going to strike,
[1:04:25] God says, "When I see the blood, I will
[1:04:29] pass over you." Aren't you glad for
[1:04:33] that?
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that that that he is
[1:04:37] Amen. He says, "And the blood shall be
[1:04:40] to you for a token upon the houses where
[1:04:44] you are. When I see the blood, I will
[1:04:48] pass over you, and the plagues shall not
[1:04:51] be upon you to destroy you when I smite
[1:04:54] the land of Egypt." Well, can you say
[1:04:56] amen?
[1:05:00] Now, the last I remembered there in
[1:05:02] Revelations, I believe in the ninth
[1:05:03] chapter
[1:05:05] when the bottom when when the when when
[1:05:07] the angel of the bottomless pit comes
[1:05:09] in, opens it up and he's man and all the
[1:05:12] plagues are coming upon the earth.
[1:05:13] They're coming upon the fearful and the
[1:05:15] unbelieving.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; They're not coming upon the elect. It
[1:05:19] affects us all.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; But the mighty angel has come with
[1:05:24] healing in his wings.
[1:05:26] So, we're living in this earth that's
[1:05:28] been cursed. And because of the cursing
[1:05:30] of this earth that we're living in,
[1:05:32] we're we're we're we're, you know, we're
[1:05:34] breathing the smog and whatever. And
[1:05:36] we're we're having to we're eating all
[1:05:38] of the junk. We're doing I mean I Hey,
[1:05:39] it affects us all. It does. But I am the
[1:05:42] Lord. Somebody say, "I am the Lord that
[1:05:44] health thee."
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, there were provisions
[1:05:49] for two million people. Hallelujah. In
[1:05:53] the wilderness. Now I want you to think
[1:05:55] about that.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. There there. And the Bible says
[1:05:59] that after that Passover, there was not
[1:06:03] one feeble person.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Two million people and not one feeble
[1:06:09] person.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; See, brother Widow, that was way back
[1:06:11] then. They that man, that was that was
[1:06:13] that was way Listen, they were a type,
[1:06:16] brother.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; That was a type of God's elect. Today,
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; they were going to a natural land.
[1:06:22] YOU'RE GOING TO YOUR POSSESSIONS THAT
[1:06:26] ADAM LOST.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; And Adam would never Adam didn't have
[1:06:32] sickness. Adam didn't have death. Adam
[1:06:35] didn't have any of that until the fall.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; We're going back to our promise.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not one. The Bible says there in
[1:06:47] in Psalms 105 and 37, he brought them
[1:06:50] forth also with silver and gold. And
[1:06:53] there was not one feeble person among
[1:06:57] them
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; among their tribes. Well, can you say
[1:07:00] amen? Hallelujah. Let's just look at
[1:07:02] something else. Some of the other
[1:07:03] supernatural things. Because it wasn't
[1:07:05] just their healing. It wasn't just their
[1:07:07] healing. The the Bible says their
[1:07:09] clothes didn't even get old.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. COULD YOU
[1:07:15] could you imagine? Could you imagine you
[1:07:17] girls? Amen. You you you girls sitting
[1:07:19] here growing up getting growing up and
[1:07:22] growing up and your shoes grow with you.
[1:07:26] You say now that that that can't h Well,
[1:07:28] let's just see what the Bible says about
[1:07:29] it. Hallelujah.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Now Deuteronomy 29 and5. I have led you
[1:07:35] 40 years in the wilderness, and your
[1:07:37] clothes are not waxing old, and the shoe
[1:07:42] is not waxing old off thy foot.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; I I don't know. I don't know if they had
[1:07:51] weight problems like me or not. Amen.
[1:07:54] But I guess as as they grew, the the the
[1:07:56] clothes grew. Hallelujah. Amen. So God
[1:07:59] even God God even cared for the chubby
[1:08:01] folks. Amen. And he cared for you young
[1:08:04] folks. He cared for them. THE ARE Y'ALL
[1:08:06] HEARING ME? IT WAS A supernatural thing.
[1:08:09] God, they were under ORDERS TO GO TO
[1:08:13] THAT LAND. AND GOD WAS GOING TO PROVIDE.
[1:08:16] WE ARE UNDER MANDATE FROM GOD TO MAKE A
[1:08:20] RAPTURE. AND GOD IS GOING TO KEEP EVERY
[1:08:24] ONE OF YOU.
[1:08:26] YES,
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; SIR.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; I KNOW WE'VE GOT TO GET OLD AND DIE.
[1:08:29] THAT'S FINE. BUT WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE
[1:08:31] THIS PLACE DISEASED.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; When it's time FOR ME TO GO, THEN
[1:08:35] HALLELUJAH. How Amen. I praise the Lord.
[1:08:40] We I was going I've always said, "Let's
[1:08:41] just let it be a really a really tough
[1:08:43] car wreck." And Amen. I might I might
[1:08:45] adjust that prayer. Hallelujah. But uh I
[1:08:47] mean just no suffering. Just just LET ME
[1:08:49] GO. I DON'T CARE. OR OR OR OR YOU KNOW,
[1:08:52] just go to sleep, not wake up. I don't
[1:08:55] YOU YOU UNDERSTAND? I BELIEVE GOD CAN DO
[1:08:57] THAT. HOW MANY BELIEVES THAT? YEAH,
[1:09:00] BROTHER.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:09:09] Brother Brandham would say, "Now, when
[1:09:10] you receive this bread, remember it
[1:09:13] represents the lamb. It was at it was at
[1:09:16] the uh Passover or communion. Long years
[1:09:20] ago when Israel's lamb was roasted over
[1:09:22] fire and was taken with bitter herbs,
[1:09:25] the people had strength and their shoes
[1:09:27] never wore out and their clothes uh
[1:09:29] never come threadbearing all through the
[1:09:32] journey till they hit the promised land.
[1:09:33] May God keep us healthy, happy, serving
[1:09:37] him until we reach the promised land
[1:09:40] that he has given us.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Well, that's the way he seen it.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; That's the way he believed it.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; What can you say? Amen. Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm fighting, Brother Wendle. I I'm
[1:09:51] in a battle.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; I I understand.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; But the fight needs to be by faith.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; It's got to be the good fight of faith.
[1:10:01] Satan is there to get us so hinder our
[1:10:03] faith.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Healing is for every one of God's
[1:10:07] people.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; When the water was bitter, God provided.
[1:10:11] Amen. Cut down a tree and put in the
[1:10:13] water and and and and God made it
[1:10:16] bitter. Praise the Lord. When they
[1:10:18] needed food, God provided mana and God
[1:10:21] provided quail. When they sinned and
[1:10:24] Amen. And and and and God provided
[1:10:28] healing for them. Well, that's right.
[1:10:30] Another place when they need God
[1:10:31] provided water out of a rock.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so I I I I I my my
[1:10:37] thoughts here tonight is God. Oh God,
[1:10:41] Lord, we need healing here.
[1:10:45] We our our our our little group needs
[1:10:47] healing.
[1:10:49] And and I I I want us to really I I want
[1:10:52] us to really really think about this and
[1:10:55] and and I want us to get a burden for
[1:10:57] for for one another because we are a we
[1:11:01] I so I we we are a body. We're a body.
[1:11:06] And um as as I as I've been looking at
[1:11:09] this a at you know the needs that that
[1:11:12] we have here and and and um you're well
[1:11:16] taught. I I believe our church is well
[1:11:18] taught.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; I you know I I I believe we know all of
[1:11:23] these things. I'm I'm I'm not preaching
[1:11:24] at you as if you don't know these
[1:11:27] things, but I'm bringing these things
[1:11:29] back to our remembrance.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; And then getting the earnestness
[1:11:35] and feeding upon these scriptures and
[1:11:38] feeding upon God's word
[1:11:40] because none of us in ourselves can make
[1:11:42] anything happen. But this is what God
[1:11:44] did say. You know what I guess what I'm
[1:11:47] trying to say here is you can't give
[1:11:49] yourself faith. I can't give myself
[1:11:51] faith.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; But there's one thing that will give us
[1:11:54] faith.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; Hearing the word of God. Come on.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; Faith comes by hearing
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; the word of God.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; So take these scriptures, put these
[1:12:12] things in our mind and start dwelling
[1:12:14] upon them and start eating those
[1:12:18] spiritual vitamins.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; Because every time, every time in the
[1:12:23] Moses, every time when when sickness
[1:12:25] came in the in the wilderness, every
[1:12:27] time Hallelujah. Amen. When there was a
[1:12:30] when there was a baby that was born that
[1:12:32] was Amen. And with complications, they'd
[1:12:36] run to Dr. Moses, Dr. Moses would bring
[1:12:39] over his little his his little satchel.
[1:12:41] Amen. His little his little doctor bag.
[1:12:45] Hallelujah. And he'd pull out,
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; I am the Lord that healeth thee.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Ah, that's not script." That's
[1:12:51] what the Bible said.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whenever someone started,
[1:12:55] Amen. kind of leprosy or something
[1:12:57] started coming. I am the Lord that
[1:12:59] health thee.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Look, look when they got
[1:13:07] into their own INTO THEIR PROMISED LAND.
[1:13:09] Did you know that they never even lost
[1:13:12] one man in battle until Achan sinned?
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; That's right. WHEN THEY WERE FIGHTING
[1:13:18] GIANTS,
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ORDAINED OF GOD to do it.
[1:13:24] That's right.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; And we are ordained of God.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; I don't care who disbelieves.
[1:13:32] I don't care how much it comes. You are
[1:13:35] NOT ONE OF THEM. YOU ARE NOT AN
[1:13:38] EGYPTIAN. YOU ARE NOT A LEODYSIAN. YOU
[1:13:40] ARE NOT A CHURCH MEMBER. YOU ARE A SON
[1:13:42] AND DAUGHTER OF GOD.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; The only thing I see for believer
[1:13:50] Amen. LAY HANDS ON THE SICK AND THEY
[1:13:52] SHALL RECOVER. AMEN.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY THING THAT I SEE FOR A
[1:13:57] BELIEVER, AMEN, IS TO SOUND THE TRUMPET.
[1:14:01] SOUND THAT TRUMPET. LET IT BE KNOWN. LET
[1:14:05] THE UH THE ears of the believer hear the
[1:14:09] words of God.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:14:18] When Kora led a rebellion
[1:14:22] against Moses
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; and the people believed loudmouth Kora
[1:14:30] over the vindicated prophet Moses.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; And it wasn't just a dozen.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Well, praise the Lord.
[1:14:42] There was 14,700
[1:14:45] people died of that plague.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; But you know what God said?
[1:14:53] He He said, "Put up." Well, praise the
[1:14:57] Lord.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; He He actually He told He told Moses
[1:15:02] told Aaron, "Run out. Run in there and
[1:15:05] grab grab the incense colas off of the
[1:15:08] altar."
[1:15:10] Amen. And they and and they they they
[1:15:12] put them in in and they they took the
[1:15:14] incense and begin to go out there
[1:15:16] between the living and the dead. And
[1:15:18] they were and and and they were running
[1:15:20] out there. Mo Aaron, he was the he was
[1:15:22] the high priest and he was running out
[1:15:24] there between and you know what it
[1:15:27] caused God to stop
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Sure did
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; the plague
[1:15:33] and healed the people
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; even for their sins.
[1:15:39] Are you hearing me?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, now they were saying,
[1:15:43] "You're not the only holy man. We're
[1:15:45] gifted just like you." And you know, God
[1:15:47] speaks to us just like he speaks to you.
[1:15:49] And and and all of this. But when Aaron
[1:15:51] ran out there and started he interceding
[1:15:55] for healing for the people, THE PLAGUE
[1:15:59] WAS STOPPED and the people were healed.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; Right. right here.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; What about the other time they're in in
[1:16:10] numbers uh 16:46 when when when the uh
[1:16:15] you know that they were dying. Amen.
[1:16:19] Because they were they were rebelling
[1:16:21] again. Hallelujah. When thousands of the
[1:16:24] children of Israel were dying and they
[1:16:27] were being bit by serpents because of
[1:16:29] their sin. Hallelujah. But God provided
[1:16:33] a healing. So, what I'm trying to tell
[1:16:35] you here tonight, what I'm I'm trying to
[1:16:37] give you guys some ammo against the
[1:16:40] devil.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; The devil telling you, "Well, you've
[1:16:42] sinned and you can't be healed." But
[1:16:44] it's time if God will do that through a
[1:16:48] through a a natural man by the name of
[1:16:50] Aaron.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; AND IF GOD WILL COME IN, ARE YOU hearing
[1:16:55] me? What will he do when Jesus Christ
[1:16:57] paid the ultimate price?
[1:17:01] What I'm saying is I I I don't care what
[1:17:04] the devil's bringing against you
[1:17:05] tonight.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; I don't care what he's bringing against
[1:17:08] you tonight. God provided healing. He
[1:17:11] told Moses to make that serpent of brass
[1:17:14] and get it lifted up in the midst of the
[1:17:16] people. And those who looked upon that
[1:17:19] brass serpent were healed. If they were
[1:17:22] willing to look away from their sickness
[1:17:25] and willing to look at that brass
[1:17:26] serpent, they were healed. Now remember
[1:17:29] what was Aaron the high priest. We have
[1:17:32] a priest that has already entered behind
[1:17:34] the veil interceding for you.
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. What did the brazen serpent?
[1:17:40] Serpents always represent sin. It was
[1:17:43] the serpent who introduced sin to Eve.
[1:17:46] Sin. SERPENT. HALLELUJAH. BRASS SERPENT.
[1:17:50] It was sin judged. SIN HAS ALREADY BEEN
[1:17:54] JUDGED BY CALVARY FOR YOU. OH,
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; so you can look and live. Well, PRAISE
[1:18:02] THE LORD.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; I SAID, "PRAISE THE LORD." WHEN PEOPLE
[1:18:05] STARTED GETTING LEPOUS, AMEN. LEPROSY
[1:18:07] COMING OVER AND TAKING THEM OVER. AMEN.
[1:18:09] During in in in LEVITICUS 14 AND 18, GOD
[1:18:13] PROVIDED AN atonement for their leprosy.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; It don't matter what you are facing here
[1:18:21] tonight,
[1:18:22] healing is yours.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:27] I'm here to tell you and I I just You
[1:18:30] can go through Leviticus that 14th and
[1:18:32] 15th chapter and it's just anything you
[1:18:34] can imagine.
[1:18:36] Amen. He was putting it out there
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; to to to make sure that you was going to
[1:18:40] be healed.

[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, cancer's not in there."
[1:18:45] Well, it's here now.

[1:18:52] has been lifted so high. has been
[1:18:53] exalted all the way.

[1:19:01] above every name.

[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; When Jesus come,
[1:19:24] he says, "The spirit of the Lord God is
[1:19:26] upon me for he hath anointed me to
[1:19:32] preach the gospel to the poor.
[1:19:37] He hath sent me to heal the
[1:19:40] brokenhearted, the spirit, to preach
[1:19:43] deliverance to the captives, the soul,
[1:19:47] and the recovering of the sight to the
[1:19:49] blind, the body, to set at liberty them
[1:19:53] that are bruised, spirit and soul, to
[1:19:56] preach the acceptable year of the Lord.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Whose report do you believe? Amen.

[1:32:29] having nose bleeds and and you know, she
[1:32:32] had listen she she didn't have um her
[1:32:34] her blood wasn't thick. It was just it
[1:32:36] was all thinning out. She didn't have
[1:32:37] platelets and the doctors had had I
[1:32:40] mean, the doctors had told her that

[1:32:51] giving they were giving her infusions,
[1:32:54] transfusions. They were doing this. I
[1:32:57] mean, she went through so much of that
[1:32:58] stuff. She would have to sit there for
[1:33:00] eight hours with them taking blood out
[1:33:02] of her and and and redoing it and

[1:45:02] scripture where Paul says, "For me to to
[1:45:04] to
[1:45:07] what what is that?" Uh to to to die is
[1:45:09] gain. Uh
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; uh you know listen he was saying huh
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; live as Christ.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah to live as Christ. But he was
[1:45:17] saying I I you know I I want to go but
[1:45:18] for your sakes I want to stay. How's
[1:45:20] that how's that go? Uh u you know
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; You know he's just basically saying hey
[1:45:26] guys I want to go but you know I also
[1:45:30] know that that's sort of selfish and so
[1:45:32] if Christ wants to declare his glory
[1:45:34] through me then then I'm just going to
[1:45:37] do that. I I want to do that. So he here
[1:45:40] we stand here today. I know many times
[1:45:42] I'm saying, "Lord, just take me home."
[1:45:43] And I just woo. Hallelujah. And I'll see
[1:45:46] y'all on the other side. Amen. But if
[1:45:50] I'm here, God's got a purpose for me.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; I've got to declare I've got to declare
[1:45:56] the How is God going to declare he's a
[1:45:58] healer?
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; Through me.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Through you.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; He's got to allow us to get sick.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; He's got to allow US TO GO THROUGH OUR
[1:46:07] STRUGGLES.
[1:46:10] That's the only way that we're going to
[1:46:11] be able to do it. You know, he he does
[1:46:14] that through he he does that through uh
[1:46:16] uh you know, but he has to allow guys
[1:46:19] like Patrick to to to go wayward and and
[1:46:23] uh you know, go through all of the the
[1:46:27] junk he went through
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; to prove that he's a redeemer.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; He y'all understand what I'm saying?
[1:46:35] He's got to allow these things
[1:46:39] But the thing is is he is a redeemer. He
[1:46:41] is a healer. He is a savior. And I want
[1:46:45] us to believe that tonight.
[1:46:48] So if there's anyone that would like to,
[1:46:50] I know I took a little longer than I
[1:46:51] wanted to, other than I planned on it,
[1:46:54] should I say.
[1:46:55] I uh if if um the musicians would come
[1:47:00] and then we will you know we just want
[1:47:03] to pray and I I in a minute we're just
[1:47:04] all going to gather together and and um
[1:47:08] we're we're going to pray and Angie's
[1:47:09] going in for a surgery tomorrow
[1:47:12] and they think they found out what her
[1:47:15] problem has been and so um she's she's
[1:47:19] going in in the morning.
[1:47:21] Um, we got brother Donald with with that
[1:47:24] cellulitis and man, they've been running
[1:47:26] every kind of a uh I mean they they put
[1:47:29] they they've got him on so many
[1:47:30] antibiotics right now
[1:47:33] and u I mean they've got him on a bunch
[1:47:35] of antibiotics trying to trying to get
[1:47:37] that that that
[1:47:40] uh staff or whatever it is killed.
[1:47:43] And so, uh,
[1:47:46] I mean, I know I know this ain't just a
[1:47:48] this this ain't just a
[1:47:52] a classy, uh, preaching message here
[1:47:54] tonight, but, I my my deal is I just
[1:47:56] hope we can get get a clearer picture of
[1:47:59] who we are, what we are, and let's just
[1:48:01] get together and let's just believe God
[1:48:03] for some miracles.
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; We really need some miracles.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:12] And uh I mean, okay,
[1:48:16] brother Jimmy has about lost his sight
[1:48:17] with diabet diabetes. He's wanting to
[1:48:19] come to church. Well, why shouldn't we
[1:48:21] believe that God can heal an 84 year old
[1:48:24] man and give him his eyesight so he can
[1:48:26] drive to church?
[1:48:28] Sister Betty's wanting to be at church,
[1:48:30] but her legs are are so are so swelled
[1:48:32] up right now, weeping and and getting
[1:48:34] sores on her legs. Why can't we believe
[1:48:36] that an 87 year old woman who wants to
[1:48:38] be here every service and she would be
[1:48:41] here every service if she could?
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; Why why uh uh uh uh uh you know uh we
[1:48:48] we've got we we've got all of these that
[1:48:52] are that are some major needs.
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; Why can't we just believe God for that?
[1:48:59] I mean I'm not I'm not asking I'm not
[1:49:01] asking you all as if you guys are
[1:49:02] unbelievers. I'm asking as as as a team,
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; why why why can't we as a team
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; just pull together and say, "Lord,
[1:49:12] Brother Torrance has been struggling in
[1:49:14] his body." Well, what why I I know I
[1:49:18] know Brother Torrance is is 80. I think
[1:49:20] he's Aren't you 87, Brother Torrance?
[1:49:22] 88. 87.
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; 85. Woo. I'm trying to push you on. 85.
[1:49:29] and and he he can't even he can't even
[1:49:30] come uh church on Sunday mornings
[1:49:32] because it you know just just uh uh
[1:49:35] things in his body and and just just
[1:49:37] having a hard time. He wants to be here.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why? You know, I I just I I
[1:49:47] just believe the Lord
[1:49:49] God has a soft spot a soft spot in his
[1:49:53] heart for those that are needy.
[1:49:57] And I I I I mean I I believe I had a
[1:49:59] soft spot in his heart when I was in
[1:50:01] need and he came along and saved me.
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; I believe he still has a soft spot for
[1:50:05] me.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; I believe he still has a soft spot for
[1:50:08] all of us. Well, if God saved you, then
[1:50:12] dog on it,
[1:50:15] he can heal you. That ain't no problem.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:50:24] So,
[1:50:25] if u if we could just bring a bring a
[1:50:28] chair up here for for Denise and and let
[1:50:30] her sit down up here and then
[1:50:34] we'll pray for Denise. Um and then
[1:50:36] anyone else who's who's needing prayer,
[1:50:39] but some of these ones that I've talked
[1:50:41] about,
[1:50:43] Brother Mitch.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:50:55] Yeah.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Well, God God is a healer.
[1:51:03] There's nothing there's nothing too
[1:51:05] great. And and again, I I don't want any
[1:51:06] of us any of us coming coming in tonight
[1:51:10] with the um with the idea of u I I hope
[1:51:14] I brought I I I I I dealt with the sin
[1:51:17] problem enough here tonight to let you
[1:51:19] know
[1:51:20] Christ took our filth
[1:51:24] and gave us his righteousness.
[1:51:29] So you can't come before the Lord and
[1:51:31] say, "I'm filthy. I don't know if I
[1:51:33] deserve it." you're righteous.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; If you've accepted the atonement,
[1:51:41] why not accept your healing? If he
[1:51:43] redeemed your life from destruction, why
[1:51:45] not accept all of these other things?
[1:51:51] Sometimes it can be a little hard for
[1:51:52] ourselves. It is. It's easier for me to
[1:51:55] believe for somebody else sometimes than
[1:51:58] to believe for me because I know me.
[1:52:12] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:15] So, if we have a heart tonight that
[1:52:18] says, "I I'm just going to believe him.
[1:52:19] I'm going to believe the Lord." Then I
[1:52:20] want you to come up. There's anyone else
[1:52:22] that needs to be prayed for, just come
[1:52:24] you come on up and stand here, too. Uh
[1:52:27] Denise, come on up. Uh Sister Angie, you
[1:52:30] come on up. Brother Mitch, you come on
[1:52:32] up.
[1:52:34] Uh, anyone that's been fighting,
[1:52:37] struggling, you just you just need us to
[1:52:39] pray for you. Now this
[1:52:48] and then we'd like I'd like for sure you
[1:52:50] you uh ministers to come and um Kobe if
[1:52:54] if Mary could play for you
[1:52:58] and then Um
[1:53:14] and then um and any of you elders that
[1:53:17] would like for to come. We're not we're
[1:53:19] not putting it just to the preachers,
[1:53:20] but any any of you believing elders
[1:53:25] now, you know,
[1:53:28] I I'm I'm a little bit tired tonight and
[1:53:31] so I don't um
[1:53:34] I don't really uh you know, feel a
[1:53:37] little bit scattered, but I I hope I
[1:53:39] hope that I've I've done a
[1:53:42] a good enough job laying out my case.
[1:53:47] We just got to believe the Lord. Yep.
[1:53:48] Just pass that around, you preachers,
[1:53:50] and then just pass it around to all of
[1:53:52] the all of the believers that are that
[1:53:53] are gathered around
[1:53:56] now
[1:54:01] here in in Mark 4 and and we're just
[1:54:04] going to go ahead and uh read that to
[1:54:07] you. I wasn't, but I'm going to.
[1:54:10] And uh
[1:54:12] now this is I you know I just think
[1:54:15] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:54:16] the word. And so we've got to believe.
[1:54:19] So this is what Jesus said after his
[1:54:21] resurrection.
[1:54:23] He he afterward he appeared unto the 11
[1:54:25] as they sat at meat and upgraded them
[1:54:28] with their unbelief and hardness of
[1:54:30] heart because they believed not them
[1:54:32] which had seen him after his r he was
[1:54:34] risen. He said unto them, "Go ye into
[1:54:37] all the world, preach the gospel to
[1:54:39] every creature. He that believeth and is
[1:54:41] baptized shall be saved, but he that
[1:54:44] believeth not shall be damned.
[1:54:47] These signs shall follow them that
[1:54:50] believe." I just I wonder how many
[1:54:52] believers we have in the building.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; In my name, they shall cast out devils.
[1:54:59] They shall speak with new tongues. They
[1:55:01] shall take up serpents. If they drink
[1:55:04] any deadly thing, it shall not hurt
[1:55:06] them. And they shall lay hands on the
[1:55:09] sick, and they shall
[1:55:14] recover.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; Now, that was what Jesus said just
[1:55:19] before he left.
[1:55:22] I'm going to fill you with my spirit.
[1:55:24] I've got to go. And if I don't go, then
[1:55:27] the Holy Spirit cannot come and fill you
[1:55:29] all as a body. You're going to
[1:55:31] altogether be my body. Now I'm going to
[1:55:36] the pillar of fire that was in Jesus on
[1:55:38] the day of Pentecost that logos that
[1:55:40] pillar of fire separated itself and the
[1:55:43] cloven tongues of fire came on that 120.
[1:55:46] Everyone that is filled with the baptism
[1:55:48] of the Holy Ghost. A portion of that
[1:55:50] great pillar of fire comes in them. We
[1:55:53] are not Jesus Christ. We are not the
[1:55:55] perfect son of God. But together we make
[1:55:58] up the body of Christ.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; So you shall lay hands on the sick. Now
[1:56:04] here in in James 5 and um
[1:56:09] um 5 and13, is any among you afflicted?
[1:56:14] Let him pray. Is any merry? Let him sing
[1:56:18] psalms. And if we need to get uh uh
[1:56:20] sister Angie a chair, you brothers can
[1:56:22] bring bring a chair over here for sister
[1:56:24] Angie, too. is but but y'all y'all
[1:56:27] listen to me while they're doing it now.
[1:56:28] Is any sick among you? Let him call for
[1:56:33] the elders of the church and let them
[1:56:37] pray over him, anointing him with oil in
[1:56:42] the name of the Lord. And the prayer of
[1:56:45] faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
[1:56:49] shall raise him up. And if he's
[1:56:52] committed any sins, they shall be
[1:56:56] forgiven him. Confess your faults one to
[1:57:00] another. Pray one for another that you
[1:57:04] may be healed. The effectual fervent
[1:57:07] prayer of a righteous man avails much.
[1:57:12] Can you say amen?
[1:57:14] now.
[1:57:16] So,
[1:57:19] we're just simply doing uh what they
[1:57:22] have commanded. And so, the oil, we have
[1:57:25] all got some oil with us. And um uh and
[1:57:30] so we're just going to uh
[1:57:34] all gather together and pray. And I know
[1:57:36] you're here. I know you're here to pray
[1:57:38] for these and we appreciate that. But I
[1:57:40] also want us to pray for Sister Tracy.
[1:57:42] Do you need a chair?
[1:57:44] Um, I want I want you you just come on
[1:57:47] up here. I appreciate you coming up to
[1:57:49] pray, too. And, uh, I think Brother
[1:57:52] Michael's already anointed y'all.
[1:57:54] And, uh,
[1:57:57] now guys, there's no science to this.
[1:58:01] We just Jesus said, "You'll lay hands on
[1:58:04] the sick and they shall recover." James
[1:58:06] comes back in, says, "Call for the
[1:58:08] elders. We're here around you.
[1:58:12] Anoint them with oil and the prayer of
[1:58:14] faith shall save the sick. It's just
[1:58:16] that simple. That's how all of these
[1:58:19] other miracles have been done.
[1:58:23] Y'all believe that?
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:58:27] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father,
[1:58:30] as we lay hands upon the sick,
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; we've got some impossible cases here.
[1:58:41] Lord, if we don't
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; get miracles,
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; things could get ugly.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; We don't pretend to be really
[1:58:57] big in faith. We don't claim to be
[1:58:59] spiritual supermen.
[1:59:02] We just simply claim
[1:59:04] &gt;&gt; to be your children and that you have
[1:59:06] commissioned us to lay hands on the sick
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; and that they would recover.
[1:59:13] Now, Father, with all the faith that we
[1:59:15] have,
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; we are taking these scriptures that we
[1:59:19] have talked about tonight and we're
[1:59:23] applying them to our hearts.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; And I'm asking for a new liver for
[1:59:29] Sister Angie. Yes, Jesus.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; I'm asking, Lord, that you would take
[1:59:34] those tumors away,
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; that you would dissolve them and heal
[1:59:39] her, Lord.
[1:59:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're not going by how we feel.
[1:59:43] We're not going by what we see. We're
[1:59:45] not going by what we hear from the
[1:59:48] doctors. We are going by your word. We
[1:59:50] have chosen to believe your report,
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Lord.
[1:59:57] Sister
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; Denise father, they the they were going
[2:00:02] to take and do that surgery on the 26th
[2:00:05] and they said it's just too complicated.
[2:00:07] They're sending her to another
[2:00:09] specialist, Lord. And and Lord, they
[2:00:12] they're claiming it's all cancerous and
[2:00:16] father.
[2:00:18] &gt;&gt; We need a miracle.
[2:00:21] And
[2:00:21] &gt;&gt; I'm asking God that you would
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; come upon this neck and that you would
[2:00:26] bring that healing and just totally
[2:00:28] touch Sister Denise.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Lord, with all of our faith, we're
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; we're putting our hands upon that lamb
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; that was shed, that
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; blood that was shed for us, and we claim
[2:00:45] our healing. Thank you.
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; I thank you for it, Lord.
[2:00:51] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm asking that you would touch
[2:00:52] her supernaturally right now
[2:00:55] &gt;&gt; that your grace would be upon her.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; Lord, you see this diabetes and you see,
[2:01:03] Lord, this bladder.
[2:01:06] I'm asking God
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; that when the doctors have said it's
[2:01:10] impossible, that there's nothing else
[2:01:12] they can do.
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; I'm asking God that you would just
[2:01:16] totally touch my sister Tracy.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; I'm asking that you would infuse her
[2:01:22] with your divine faith. We cannot
[2:01:24] believe on our own. It requires your
[2:01:26] faith and we're coming upon we're
[2:01:28] hearing your word tonight and we're
[2:01:31] asking you to turn that word into faith.
[2:01:33] turn our hearing into divine faith.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; We don't know how it happens. We just
[2:01:39] believe that you do it.
[2:01:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm asking, God, that you would give
[2:01:43] her a brand new bladder.
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; I'm asking that you would give her,
[2:01:47] Lord, a blood transfusion.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Take away that diabetes.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; Help her, Lord.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus,
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; I thank you for it, Lord. You see this
[2:02:00] depression and this take away,
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; Lord. All of this stuff that Satan has
[2:02:07] tried to kill this lady,
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; Satan's tried,
[2:02:11] Lord, and he's left her feeling like
[2:02:13] she's worthless. Left her feeling
[2:02:16] lonely.
[2:02:18] But oh, Satan, you're a liar.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; You're a liar.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; No one has ever too far gone. And the
[2:02:27] blood reaches. I don't care where we
[2:02:30] are, what we are fighting, where we are
[2:02:34] in our mind. Satan, you're a liar.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; You're a liar. In the name of Jesus,
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; bring victory. Give her liberty, Lord.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, we lay hands. We cast out everything
[2:02:50] that is contrary.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; And we thank you for doing it, Lord.
[2:02:56] Hallelujah. The blood sugar, Lord. And
[2:02:58] I'm asking that you would give him a a
[2:03:00] blood transfusion. That blood sucking
[2:03:02] demon. I'm asking you take it out of
[2:03:05] that body in the name of Jesus
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; and give him that healing of his body.
[2:03:11] Lord, you have done it. You have healed
[2:03:14] sugar diabetes on many occasions. And
[2:03:17] we're expecting the same tonight
[2:03:20] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus.
[2:03:23] In the name of Jesus.
[2:03:26] In the name of Jesus. Oh God.
[2:03:29] Oh God.
[2:03:32] My brother Lord who has struggled in his
[2:03:35] body Lord. That diabetes
[2:03:38] Lord. And you see his neck. You see the
[2:03:42] ailments how Satan Lord would love to
[2:03:45] just him, Father.
[2:03:47] But God, we've heard your word. And
[2:03:49] we're asking God that that word would
[2:03:51] become faith.
[2:03:54] and that faith would just rise to the
[2:03:56] occasion and reach up and claim this
[2:04:00] promise that has been given specifically
[2:04:04] to my brother Mitch. We're going to set
[2:04:06] up at the table now. We're pulling up to
[2:04:08] the plate and we're asking that you
[2:04:11] would hand us over some healing.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; Oh God, a blood transfusion,
[2:04:18] OH GOD, A BRAND new neck.
[2:04:22] Let it be a witness, Lord, for your
[2:04:24] divine glory.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus,
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; thank you
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus.
[2:04:33] We thank you for it. Nothing's
[2:04:35] impossible, Tracy.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Nothing's impossible, Tracy.
[2:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; Nothing's impossible, Denise. Nothing's
[2:04:43] impossible, Denise.
[2:04:45] &gt;&gt; I don't care. It don't matter. Nothing's
[2:04:48] impossible.
[2:04:50] Just reach out and grab it. You're
[2:04:52] sitting at his table tonight. He has the
[2:04:54] table spread. It's ours tonight, Angie.
[2:04:58] It's yours.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; Don't look back. Don't look at your
[2:05:02] failures. Don't look. If God does it for
[2:05:04] sinners, why can't he do it for you
[2:05:06] that's been redeemed?
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Satan gives us complexes and tells us
[2:05:10] that we're not worthy of it. I say
[2:05:12] tonight, let's believe with all that
[2:05:15] we've got. Sister Sister Leah, are you
[2:05:19] still struggling with that area that are
[2:05:22] you have you seen the doctor yet?
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; You're going to go next month.
[2:05:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's got a tumor. Um I don't even
[2:05:30] know how to say it.
[2:05:31] &gt;&gt; Pituitary
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; pituitary.
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Pituitary tumor. And it's really it's
[2:05:37] really starting to affect her. She's
[2:05:38] going to the doctor this next month. I'm
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; telling you, the devil's attacking us.
[2:05:44] But we ain't going to lay down, guys.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, we have seen tumors fall off on
[2:05:54] multiple occasions,
[2:05:56] but I'm asking that you would do it
[2:05:58] right now for my
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; my sister. She's been a faithful mama, a
[2:06:04] faithful wife, a faithful a faithful
[2:06:07] daughter of yours,
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; and a great friend to all of us here.
[2:06:11] Satan, you're a liar.
[2:06:14] We're putting our faith in that into
[2:06:16] action and we are claiming that healing
[2:06:18] right now.
[2:06:20] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're thanking you for performing
[2:06:23] that miracle.
[2:06:24] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; do you believe it?
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; Do you believe God will give you that
[2:06:30] baby?
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; All it takes is believe in it.
[2:06:35] &gt;&gt; God will give you that baby. There's
[2:06:36] nothing impossible. He wants to give us
[2:06:39] our heart's desires. His presence is
[2:06:42] here tonight. Nothing's impossible. If
[2:06:45] he can do it for a 90-year-old Sarah,
[2:06:48] why can't he do it for you, Brianna?
[2:06:50] Let's believe the Lord for a baby.
[2:06:52] Father, you know the complications.
[2:06:57] Lord, you know what's keeping her from
[2:07:00] having it.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; And I know our minds go back to the
[2:07:03] problems that she's had as a child. and
[2:07:06] doubt wants to come in and say, "Well,
[2:07:09] maybe we're maybe it's impossible."
[2:07:12] And maybe it is,
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; but it's not going to be possible from
[2:07:17] this night forward. For we're putting
[2:07:19] our faith into your word. We've heard
[2:07:22] the word tonight. I am the Lord that
[2:07:25] heals thee.
[2:07:27] Father,
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; I'm asking that you would fix whatever
[2:07:31] is wrong
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; and that you would give her the desires
[2:07:35] of her heart.
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Give my brother the desires of his
[2:07:39] heart.
[2:07:40] &gt;&gt; Lord, give them a family. I thank you
[2:07:43] for victory. I thank you for it in the
[2:07:46] name of Jesus.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; Total victory tonight, Lord. We're going
[2:07:52] to be witness of it because we we're
[2:07:53] putting you to the test. We're thanking
[2:07:56] you for that child, Lord.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; My colon.
[2:08:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Sister Carol's got a hole. She's
[2:08:03] got couple holes in her colon. She's got
[2:08:06] a couple holes. The doctor is saying if
[2:08:08] she doesn't get get that healing,
[2:08:10] they're going to have to go in and do a
[2:08:11] surgery like they done on brother uh
[2:08:14] like like they like they done on brother
[2:08:16] David Gadman.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Father,
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; now Lord, this has been a faithful
[2:08:21] grandmother. faithful.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Faithful great grandmother.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; He's been a faithful
[2:08:31] one of my very first when I came to
[2:08:34] Pony. Lord,
[2:08:36] she's been with us all of these years.
[2:08:38] Lord, what a blessing she's been to us
[2:08:42] for your work, for your people.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; That Lord, it's not that
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; it's not that we earn anything. It
[2:08:51] It's simply, Lord, that our putting our
[2:08:53] trust in you. And now that she's getting
[2:08:55] older, she's in her 70s, Lord, and she
[2:08:58] wants to be healthy.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; I'm asking, God, that you would perform
[2:09:02] a miracle right there on that colon
[2:09:04] right now.

[2:47:43] don't care how many devils. Just keep
[2:47:45] just those things got to come out. Those

[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; Night of just total surrender. Say, "I'm
[2:47:56] going to believe his word."
[2:47:59] &gt;&gt; Man, how many believes the healing angel
[2:48:02] is here tonight?
[2:48:04] Now,
[2:48:04] &gt;&gt; Satan will try to bring in doubt. you'll
[2:48:06] try to bring in. Don't you allow it.
[2:48:09] Don't allow that devil back. Now
[2:48:11] remember what what did what did Jesus
[2:48:13] say? He says
[2:48:15] he says when a house has been swept or
[2:48:19] you cast the devil out he said amen. He
[2:48:24] said that that devil will leave at the
[2:48:26] power of Jesus. And then but he says but
[2:48:29] if we don't he says but that just know
[2:48:32] that that devil will come right back
[2:48:34] around.
[2:48:36] He'll come back in,
[2:48:38] man. He'll come back around and find the
[2:48:40] house all swept, no one living inside,
[2:48:44] and he'll bring seven more with him.
[2:48:47] And so
[2:48:49] the angel of the Lord, I told brother
[2:48:52] Brandham to told him to watch and how
[2:48:54] that when they would cast out devils and
[2:48:56] healing and things like that, he said,
[2:48:58] "You watch 36 to 72 hours." said that
[2:49:02] devil will come back and if you let him,
[2:49:06] he'll come right back in.
[2:49:08] Don't let him.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; Don't let him. Now, he might he he might
[2:49:13] come in. He might come in come back to
[2:49:16] you tonight when you're at home.
[2:49:18] Say, "Lord, it's taken me long to fight
[2:49:21] this fight of faith, and I ain't giving
[2:49:23] this thing up.
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put I'm going to I'm going
[2:49:26] to put the Holy Ghost right there."
[2:49:29] &gt;&gt; And don't go home worrying. just go home
[2:49:31] believing and Satan says anything just
[2:49:33] no ain't that ain't right. I'm believing
[2:49:36] what God said about
[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; you believe what God said about you.
[2:49:45] &gt;&gt; Just believe it with all your heart.
[2:49:52] Praise the Lord. He's so wonderful.
