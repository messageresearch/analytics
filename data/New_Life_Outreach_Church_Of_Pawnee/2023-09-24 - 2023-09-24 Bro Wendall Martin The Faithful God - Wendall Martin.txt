of God which is given you by Jesus Christ that in everything you are enriched by Him in all utterance and in all knowledge even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you so that you've come behind in no gift waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ who shall also confirm you unto the end someone say hallelujah that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ God is faithful by whom you are called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ Our Lord why don't we go to the Lord in prayer as we go to the Lord in prayer is there something on your heart that you would like for the Lord to remember you in today maybe you could just raise your hand and say Lord stop by my way this morning father as we come before your throne today Lord and I am ministering on the faithfulness of God and father I am asking that your Holy Spirit would be here in in such a special way this morning Lord that your glory would come Among Us supernaturally that you would meet every individual at their point of need that you'll stop by Lord every Pew and Lord that you'll minister to every heart everybody every situation Lord we look to you this morning Lord as a minister of the Gospel Lord I'm struggling a little bit in my body but I'm looking to you as well yet I know that you were faithful father I'm just asking that you would receive Glory and Honor this morning in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you can be seated this morning praise the Lord praise the Lord I want to speak on the faithfulness of God amen I I think we can look around creation and you can see his faithfulness amen you can you you look at the at the winter time or the springtime and the summertime and the the uh the fall and the winter and you see the faithfulness of God for God had said as as long as the Earth remaining there's going to be a seed time and a harvest time he says as long as there is a it is an earth there's going to be the cold and the Heat and there's going to be the winter and the summer and there's going to be the Sun is going to rise and there'll be a day and night and amen God is faithful every spring time when you a man as as as Easter comes around and you begin to see the new life that no matter what death tried to do in the in the cold winter and and no matter no matter how cold and and how amen through me that death had brought about amen when when God's sunlight begins to come back amen we find that there is a a little seed in the ground and God is faithful to that seed to bring life back in it and to bring it back up again God God faithful to every one of us amen we have our ups and downs we have our we have our spring times we have our fall times amen some of us may be in the fall season of our life but God is still faithful amen it don't matter the Situation's necessarily amen what matters is we have a faithful God what matters is is no matter where we are just remember it's not depending upon you it's not depending upon your amen your abilities it's not depending upon your powers it's depending upon what the faithfulness of God Amen Deuteronomy 7 and 9 it says know therefore the Lord thy God he is faithful which keeps Covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations amen God is so faithful God's not safe I'm just going to be good to your mom and daddy but he says I'm going to be good to the children too I'm going to be good amen to the children's children I will keep my Covenant I will keep my mercies I will keep my promises to you up to a thousand Generations oh that's a faithful God he's not a God that just starts out amen and loses interest in his creation God has very much so he's got interest in you he's got interest in your family he's not interested in your job he's got interest in everything about you God has interested in you can you say Amen amen Psalms 36 and 5 it says thy mercy O Lord is in the heavens and thy faithfulness reaches unto the clouds thy righteousness is like the great mountains thy judgment or a great deep oh God thou preserve us both man and Beast oh I say God is faithful here this morning amen God is faithful some people say well amen God is faithful for my for my soul and I'm thankful but I say God's faithful even in your physical body God's Faithfully heal you when you get sick God's faithful to deliver you amen when your spirit is weary there in first Thessalonians 5 and 23 it says and the Very God of Peace sanctify you holy and I pray God your whole Spirit soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ faithful somebody say Faith Lord Faithful Is He that calls you and who will also do it God's faithful I you know I I I if it had not been for the grace of God if it had not been for the mercies of God where were you where would you be at this morning many of us would already be in a grave many of us would already had car wrecks many of us our marriages would be split up so this morning I want us to just stop and say hey I thank you Lord for being faithful to me faithful when I ever been faithful faithful when I have not held my end of the bargain Hub I want to say thank you for being faithful unto me faithful when I was at when I've had bad attitudes faithful and I didn't believe faithful amen when I when you could have just walked away from me but you have been faithful and to me amen well praise the Lord amen I'm thankful for that that this morning amen hallelujah faithful Psalms 1 and 19 119-38 thy testimonies that thou has commanded are righteous and are very faithful now I I just want you to look for a moment here this morning if God speaks a word here and he keeps his word how about that word that he spoke concerning you before the foundation of War if he is faithful to keep the word that he has spoke concerning you amen and your healing and your and and and saying that I'll be there with you during your you know in your marriage problems or in your job problems or anything else that you look if God has been faithful Amen in in your little lifetime here on this Earth how much more will he be faithful to that predestinated word that he spoke concerning you happy beginning did you know that he can't lose a one did you know Hallelujah I know we're in him we're in an age where where where children can divorce parents and parents I guess can divorce uh uh uh you know their kids and say that I never knew yet amen and and you know um oh thank you buddy amen and and and and and we can have all of these these things here that you know we can uh uh you know where mamas ain't want nothing to do with the children anymore amen but you know that God has never lost one son God has never looked at a daughter or a son and say you know what I'm through with you God has never done that to his own genetics why because God is faithful and when you reach a hallelujah amen I I know some real close uh uh circumstances where amen where where where fathers have have excommunicated sons and Sons of excommunicated fathers but I'm glad that God is faithful to the end you know that's why I love God you know why because he's seen the end from the beginning amen he's not walking just day by day he's not just trying things out and trying to figure it out God knew it from the beginning God knew your problems God knew your weaknesses God knew your rebellions God knew everything about you God knew you was going to be here this morning amen God knew that I was going to be struggling up here preaching amen with his crazy voice but God is faithful God is faithful God seemed the whole thing and yet God said before the foundation of the world they are mine and Satan there is nothing you can do that is going to change my mind I am faithful oh that that should that should make you a Baptist shout amen faithful God has been faithful to me amen Deuteronomy now it says know therefore that the Lord your God is God the faithful God who keeps Covenant and steadfast love for those who love him and keep his Commandments to a thousand Generations amen there in Psalms 36 and 5 for your steadfast love the Lord that extends to the heavens your faithfulness to the clouds amen God is faithful now amen I you know just as I'm as I begin to look through some of these scriptures here amen and I I I I I I just wanted to to to to just just go over some of these scriptures because there's they're really good but but Psalms 89 and 8 it says oh Lord God of hosts who is as mighty as you are oh lord your faithfulness uh with your faithfulness all around you I I began to think about that faithfulness now if he's faithful again if he's faithful to those that a man uh uh you know to his creation and he's and he's faithful to uh you know those that that that forsaken the Bible says that he that he that he shines his son upon the just and the unjust and he sends his Reign upon the good and upon the evil and if he keeps his Word of Promise to them how much more will God do amen for the believer that's got his names wrote in his their names written in his book Jesus said there in John 10 and 27 he says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand My Father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to block them out of my hand [Music] because he's faithful Hallelujah you turn to your neighbor and tell him he is faithful when we say he's faithful that means your call is secure that means your purpose is secure that means that everything that God has amen there according to second second Timothy the second chapter and I think about the 19th verse amen he says nevertheless he says the the the the foundation of God stands sure God knows them that are his Hallelujah he knows them that are his this morning can you say amen amen so I I I think about that now I was thinking of another thing when I think about the faithfulness of God is faithful to give us the baptism of the Holy Ghost as I was as I've been thinking you know around about the Holy Ghost these last few weeks and amen and and Joe just been something that has been upon my heart you know Jesus last words you know a dying man a man that's only got 24 hours he and he knows he's going to die usually what's at the Forefront of his mind or deeply upon his heart is what he's going to talk about if you've only got 24 hours left and you've got your family you're you're not going to be talking about but you're going to be talking about things that are very precious serious to you that you hold dear to your heart can you say man and Jesus amen his last day with his disciples was very revealing because he knows his time is getting close now if you look there in Saint John the the uh 13th 14th 15th 16th 17th chapter you you begin to see as as as as as Jesus is nearing and especially amen the the uh uh 14th 15th and 16th chapter Jesus begins to really narrow in to on his disciples and he and he's telling them now I'm Divine you're the branches in other words I'm I'm the root here and you're not going to see me anymore I'm fixing to leave but I'm going to be faithful to live my life through you now up to this point you've depended on me to be your comforter you've depended on me Amen to hear your you've depended upon me to do those to go help your family you've depicted amen Peter brought his brought his uh is his mother-in-law over a man to be healed he amen another time Peter got in trouble with his taxes amen came to Jesus and Jesus says hey go go in there and cast into the water and amen the first fish he got open up the uh open up the mouth and and pay your taxes and my taxes he was a comforter unto those disciples but Jesus is saying I've got to leave and if I don't leave you're going to be looking to me all the time you're going to be looking to me for every situation but I've got to leave so that I can send a comforter back he says now up to this point you've asked me you've come and asked me but he says at that day you're not asking me anything but you'll come to the father in my name and whatsoever things you desire oh Hallelujah now Jesus is letting them know now I am leaving I've got to go if I don't go the the place won't be prepared and I'll never be able to receive it to myself but I promise you I'm going to remain faithful you're not going to see me you're not going to hug me you're not going to to to hear me preach to you physically anymore I'm but my faithfulness will remain true my power might Hallelujah that's the reason why I think that it's so important for you young people oh I want you young people to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost now now it's easy it's easy for somebody amen you know when you you when you're when you're there uh uh you know in sin and you're in the muck in the mind and and uh you know you're a drug addict or you're a man and and when the presence of God comes upon you it's easy for you to reach out and say I need help I need something amen and you grab it because it's your last hope you have and we'll praise the Lord how many of you all amen that came out of those real dark areas that God had to deliver you from from alcohol and drugs and and addictions and bring you out of those things you had to have a supernatural Touch Of God you had to rely upon the supernatural in your life then you say Amen but where where where we where things get a little bit shaky is when we get down to that second generation third generation fourth generation you've been raised in church setting on message pews amen you have been here you know how to amen a preacher you know how to lift your hands in worship you know how to dance the aisles you know how to sing uh songs in specials you can do all of these things and not have the Holy Ghost praise the Lord because you can learn Hallelujah I once I once said to our young people not see our young people when my when my boys were all smaller Amen to me the greatest thing is for God to come in and feel somebody sitting on the pews full of the Holy Ghost because they've got to come to an understanding that they need that comforter themselves they've got your Hallelujah when you're not addicted to something amen well you you don't appreciate it as as maybe brother Joe or sister Stephanie that that came out of those that the heroin addicts can you say Amen but we all need the Holy Ghost and God is faithful to give us the Holy Spirit today oh hallelujah amen to me one of the greatest things is God to keep a man a boy a girl from ever going outside and never going out there and falling in sin never going out there and being indicted by drugs and alcohol amen and that can come in and and God revealed by the power of His spirit amen his great light shine over them and and and for them to see the wretchedness of their soul the wretchedness of their heart and how that they need a comfort they need the power of the Holy Spirit and that boy or girl young man young young woman amen even a man or a woman can come to God and say God I am wretched without you I need you in my life just like the drug addict does just like the alcoholic does I need you can you say that amen now do you love him yes so when we look at uh at these things Jesus was letting them know Hallelujah he was letting them know I'm leaving go go home and read the 13th chapter the 14th chapter the 15th chapter the 16th chapter the 17th chapter of John Jesus is telling them in every scenario I'm going but I'm coming back but I'm going to send the comforter back to you can you say man amen because God was going to be faithful somebody say God is faithful all the sincerity I think the sincerity should be very very great in our lives and God you who who brought me maybe he did bring you out of drugs and alcohol but he's faithful to take you on and complete you amen those of you that are setting on the message pews and maybe you've never smoked a cigarette or you've never man you uh maybe you've you've never got drunk or any of those things and God bless you amen we we don't want you to ever have to go out there and do those things but we must know that God has a purpose Jesus had to die for you good boys and girls just like he had to die amen for those raunchy Sinners we're all Sinners we're out raunchy we're all going to hell except for the grace of God and his faithfulness to his word oh oh that'll make you want to shout amen when you're having problems with your amen with with things in your heart maybe you know Hallelujah if we had folks with the Holy Ghost a little bit more in the church we we we we probably amen wouldn't have all the the debates and the arguings and the fightings and things because when the Holy Spirit has come he is our comforter we don't find comfort in hate we don't find Comfort Amen in dysfunction We Are The Same Spirit that moved upon the face of the deep in the beginning when God said let there be louder when he says in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and the spirit of the Lord moved upon the face of the deep amen he took chaos he took he meant when the Earth was without form and without void when it when it had nothing beautiful about it the Bible says that the spirit of God what is the spirit of God it's the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost amen moved upon the the face of the deep what did he do amen it was that that word that word moved upon it means to brood over like a hen does her chicks like a hen does her ex amen it it means to calm upon and the spirit that moved upon the Earth had to be killing it's the same Spirit that'll move on our chaos and will bring order to our lives it'll bring order to our minds it'll bring Oya to our heart it'll bring order to a church it'll bring order to a family it'll bring order why because it's the holy spirit that is brooding Hallelujah amen now the chicken has got to set on those eggs until life comes Hallelujah now A chicken can set on those eggs and if there's no life in the egg there's nothing there there's nothing there right amen now chicken can sit on that egg that egg can set on there until she dies but if there's no life inside the eggs there ain't gonna be nothing hatch but if there is life inside you he's going to be faithful to brood over if there's life in you he's going to be faithful you're the egg he's the mama and my chick he he's the mama Eagle we don't like being called chicks amen uh he's well you're a little eaglet you're the little egg and the eagle is hovering over you because there's life oh I say today that we need a greater desire for the Holy Spirit we've got to have the Holy Spirit I don't want to be an egg a man in the in in the Nast I want the Holy Spirit to brood over me and bring my egg to life their glory to God and then all of a sudden it ain't it ain't a preacher preaching a Mama saying you better quit you better get that attitude together it ain't a daddy saying I want one more time and I'm getting the I'm getting the strap out amen it'll be all of a sudden there'll be something on the inside of that little egg amen what will it be Hallelujah Mama feel something going on underneath her there and she's just going to be faithful and sit there until it's going to be faithful to set there until amen and the egg is shaking around what's going on is there is a life on the inside of the egg and it's pecking and pecking and pecking and pecking and pecking amen why because the chicken is alive on the inside of the egg and it's Gotta come out of the shell and when we get the power of the Holy Spirit and God is so faithful to brood over a heart service after service prayer meeting after Perfect all of a sudden amen something begins to strike out I want more of God I want to obey him I want to live his life I want the power oh come on church and then what is it it's God's divine power within you living and wanting to come out of that old egg that has you bound Hallelujah amen sincerity is right so you don't have to be addicted you don't have to have those things what you do have to have is an understanding that without the power of God amen you will lay there in that egg or in that nest and rot is that right so God is faithful many times people have looked at Samson hmm Samson he was just not all you kids y'all love Samson I love Samson when I was a kid and he meant strong man he could he could take Gates and and he could he could um uh rip lions in two and and he could he he he he caught he went 300 uh foxes and you know somehow or another tied their tails together and how he'd done that without the foxes biting them and 300 foxes ties all their tails together sets them on fire amen and sends them down to the Philistines and sets the whole place on fire amen I mean Samson was just he was just oh some my he was just some big hero and and you know you you look you look at the at the at the books the kids books and and they always have him as just just big old huge guy but Samson did not have strength on his own ability no his strength and his power was in his Covenant and the Holy Spirit is a covenant that God made with you is that right it wasn't it wasn't that he Mr Samson was he was God on Earth he was Reliant and every time he'd done something major big any time he picked up the gates anytime that he the Bible says and the spirit of the Lord moved upon Samson God was faithful to Samson because Samson was in Covenant with his God foreign what did the scripture says if the scripture says and this is the Covenant that I will make with him in that day saith God I there are sins and their iniquities will I remember no more and I will write my laws on the inward parts of their heart and upon their minds will I inscribe them amen there in the book of Hebrews the scripture says and the Holy Ghost is the witness of this Covenant ah Hallelujah why would you not want it why would you not want the power come in contact and Covenant with God where he says I'll be faithful to my word to you in my name you'll cast out devils in my name you'll speak in new tongues in my name you will do those things you see when you come with that Covenant with God now but when we start playing around with that Covenant and we get away from it amen after they cut the hair some says well the Secret's in the hair no no the hair has nothing to do with it it was the Covenant and when you get away from your relationship with God and the Covenant that God has called you to you'll lose your power too well come on now you'll lose your power just like Samson did amen and then what happened which he says Samson the Philistines are upon you he jumps up and the Bible says he shakes himself as he had done in times past this time he had no power is that right so the power is in the Holy Spirit not the man and when we received the baptism of the Holy Ghost we receive his power in our lives I had a I had Assemblies of God and he's he's went on now amen and brother Eubanks when I I was when I first came to town amen he he had sort of he locked me you know and took me under his wings and and uh hey we were just little we were just kids you know and he he he he he was trying to make a uh an Assemblies of God guy out of us and and uh and so one day he says you know he says little brother he says now I know that Holiness stuff and that you preach is it's in the Bible right I'm only I'm it's in there but he says but little buddy no one can live that stuff no one can live it and so you got to be careful at your demands and I looked back at him and I said you know what a Believer can a Believer can live it not in themselves not in themselves just as Samson is just as much of a wimp without the holy spirit so are you a wimp without the Holy Spirit but when the Holy Spirit comes up on you then you're becoming powered to live a supernatural life you'll become empowered [Music] Covenant with you the holy spirit is a covenant between the invisible world and the visible world the holy spirit is the sign it's the Covenant it's that it's the very thing that Hallelujah the holy spirit says I have received the blood of your sacrifice and I am coming down and saying that you have been accepted by God no come on now when you receive the Holy Ghost you can look there to the devil and tell the devil Hallelujah I'm in Covenant with God God has accepted my sacrifice I have a right to believe I have a right to speak I have a right Amen to to to know and expect that everything that God's promised is true and it will come to pass Hallelujah because he's a faithful God amen all the sincerity the sincerity of the believer the believer that will stand up and it'll stand he in in the midst of it all I've got a covenant Hallelujah and when Samson felt back and started feeling his hair coming back he felt that hair and what did he say Lord perhaps maybe you would do this just one more time when you called me at the beginning and you told me and I I I I I've got my eyes put out I've got all this done because I've I've walked contrary to the Covenant but Lord my hair is growing back out I want I want to renew him can you say Amen Hallelujah you never lose the Covenant you lose the blessings but never the Covenant he saw you he ordained you he called you out and he is faithful to that call now you've been acting like an old poop you're the one acting like an idiot but God and you're going to have to suffer for your wrongs but God is faithful to his word and the Holy Spirit is a witness oh you Holy Ghost filled folks should be excited that God gave you a covenant Hallelujah amen so it's not the fact that I'm raised in church it's not the fact that I can sing songs it's not the fact that I'm a preacher it's a fact the fact is that My Sacrifice has been accepted and the Holy Spirit has come back upon me and empowered me again go back and read go back and read John go back and read from the Passover and he starts I mean just the that's all he's talking about for the next 24 hours making a covenant I'm coming back to you the comforter is going to be with you you won't see me you won't be able to ask me that you'll ask the father in my name I'm going to do this the comforter is going to come the guide's going to come the spirit of Truth is going to come you're in a world you've never been around you've never been a human before but I'll be your guide I'll direct you well that Spirit of Truth is come you've never been here you've never walked this way but the one who's ordained you he's going to be a comforter a guy he's gonna be a reprover too when you're wrong he's going to be faithful to reprove you well praise the Lord Hallelujah I said he's going to be a faithful to correct you amen Psalms 119 and 75 it says I know O Lord that thy judgments are right and that thou in faithfulness Hast Afflicted me Samson you messed around you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna lose your eyesight you're going to lose your power you're going to lose but Samson's a purpose your purpose your call I fordained that I'm going to make sure to correct you and put you back on the path that I've ordained for you oh come on isn't God faithful [Applause] is it aren't you thankful for that faithful God Psalms 89 and 32. then will I visit their transgressions with the rod and their iniquities with stripes nevertheless my loving kindness I want you kids to listen to me get the Lord to Terry another 10 years there's going to be a lot of things you kids are not going to know which way to go or what to do and you're going to make many mistakes many times but I want you kids to just always hear this voice that I am saying here tonight your God or this morning your God will never fail you and when you fail him he will always be there to hear your prayer when you humble yourself and say God I'm sorry 10 years 10 years ago I go fast how old are you Luke you'll be 24 in 10 years how old are you Paul how are you going to be in 10

might go through some heartaches but God will never fail his people he'll love you with an everlasting love he'll keep you with an everlasting with an everlasting grip he says no man can pluck you out of my hands I love you with an eternal love I've called you with an eternal call there's nothing anyone can do to take away my faithfulness to you [Music] he's going to be faithful he's going to be faithful to you Oh Glory to God I'm so glad I could say that with such confidence to my children or my grandchildren I'm so glad I could say that with such confidence up here to this congregation God cannot fail Ure Psalms 103 and 2. bless the Lord O my soul I want you all to read it with me everyone reading you bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits 10 years from now don't forget that scripture tomorrow morning don't forget don't forget that scripture bless the Lord O my soul and forget not forget not forget not forget not get this in your mind you're in a society of just craziness but do not forget who called you what's the next word say it with me who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeems your life from destruction you know what that's telling me that's a pretty vast deal there the benefits of a faithful God to his children is I'll always forgive you I'll always heal you and I'll always redeem you I'm there with you you're my pride that's my promise unto you are you hearing me I am not saying that I am not I'm not saying the truth might have broken bones and and hurt marriages and you might have and you I you are I am there I'm faithful I'm faithful when I'm not faithful he's faithful when you're not faithful he's faithful when you've reached your limit he's Limitless when you say I can't he says I can say out there's no way he says how things are possible can you say man he's faithful praise the Lord he's faithful he's faithful in correction and he's going he's going to correct but it's had is correction as the scripture says it's a man as the Apostle Paul says there in Hebrews he says your father's they correct you for a they correct you for a few days to their own pleasure Amen in other words you make him mad and amen there makes them feel a little better amen but God's not looking at you the same way he's looking at the outcome and and every every one of the dads in here I know they're looking at the outcome but sometimes it's a relief amen for everyone give you a paddle occasionally and say ha amen okay maybe I shouldn't say that amen but God always has a purpose he says now you've given respect unto your fathers who've done it in the flesh how much more respect should we give the father of spirits who has called us ordained us given us life can you see man no the Covenant that he's made with us is a covenant that you can look at and you should be able to go back to that Covenant and that's the reason why we don't want to say I've received the Holy Ghost because you shouted received the Holy Ghost because I felt good in a church you want to make sure that the life of God comes upon you and fills you that you know that you know because the trying days are going to come and when those trying days come you're going to be able to go back and say I remember the day I remember the time I remember him changing me changed my thoughts change my attitudes his divine grace took over in me and he's living his life through me amen are y'all catching me the holy spirit is a very real spirit and he's got very real power the same one that anointed to Jesus with the Holy Ghost and he healed the sick and he raised the dead and is now living inside you don't tell me that the Holy Spirit don't have power within you you have the power no he knows I think of this little this poem judge not the Lord by feeble sense but trust him for his grace behind a frowning Providence hides a smiling face ye fearful sir are you fearful Saints fresh courage take the cloud G so much dread or Rich with mercy and shall break in blessings or your head you see he knows the way that I take the scripture says there in Psalms 1 and 6 the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous they're in the Book of Job job had said thou knowest or he knoweth the way that I take and when he hath tried me I shall come forth as pure gold can you see man you see brother Branham would say job was not looking at his own abilities he had a covenant with God it was a blood Covenant with God and so he said that when when the enemy was coming in or when God allowed the devil to try him job could stand there by his sacrifice and he could say God will be faithful he told me to slay a lamb and that lamb would represent me and my children he could stand there and say God is faithful he says you can do the same when the enemy is coming against you and and hitting your health striking your family hitting one way or the other your friends might all be saying huh you're a secret sinner ha you God's punishing you but brother Branham says that's not always the case at all that you can stand right there though you're being Afflicted in your body stand right there by the ashes of that lamb stand right there on that ass sheep and say God I made Covenant with you I'm telling you that Covenant is powerful it made Covenant with you standing there on that ass ship you could say that healing belongs to me the salvation of my children belonged to me I am standing here in the for the my lamb was presented unto you and you know what God is faithful now you might be in tried you might be tried pretty pretty sorely right now but don't you give up confidence and don't you give up hope stand right there stand right there at that blood Covenant stand right there and say I will trust in God I've got a covenant with him he's made a covenant with me he appeared to me he gave me the lamb he said you can trust in me and I'm standing here laughs you don't know you don't know that God's bragging on you in another Realm Satan is coming up to God he has to answer to God just like he has to answer just like every one of every Spirit every devil every demon has to answer to God and he's asked to answer to God he said where have you been having Roman to and fro going throughout the Earth trying to find somebody that I can get to turn against you he goes oh how's that going well you know it's hard to do that with you got hedges around everyone he said well have you tried my servant job he goes right right speaking of Hedges that man is only Rich because you have had a hedge around him and you have blessed him that man is only standing because you have blessed his children you have blessed us flock you have blessed us you heard you have blessed everything about him and God says well I'll just remove the Hedge he says am I hearing right you you just you're telling me that you're going to remove the hatch around job is this a trick no no he goes I will be back and but it does he go out there fires falling people's dying owls and sheep I mean that we're talking about disaster in job's life and job's looking around thinking Dear God he don't know what's going on he don't know what he don't know that God just made a deal with the Devil it ain't gambling when you know what's going to happen so God wasn't gambling at all amen God just knew that his son was not and he knew that he was going to be faithful he knew that he was going to give courage unto job comes back the next month or two where you been oh you know just trying to find somebody that'll curse you hmm how's that going well it's hard oh yeah back to job well you know what a man would give for his life oh so you're telling me that you've not got him to curse me yet and you've taken his children and his all of his wealth you just let me have his life God says you can touch him you can do what you want to to his body but you can't take his life Satan says I will be back and he found out that there was something about that Covenant within the heart of job God was faithful I believe God was right there on that heart God was guarding that faith God was faithful during it all and when when the when when his wife said you should just Curse God and die he says you speak like a foolish woman Nick and I came into this world naked I'll go at God gives God takes away [Music] and then he said blessed be the name of the Lord it didn't matter it didn't matter where he was at it didn't matter what Satan brought against him he was standing there faithful upon the word of God hahaha oh he sees God knows your tears God knows God knows God knows God knows but God is faithful [Applause] he says President says if you've been prayed for hands laid on You by believers the Bible said these signs shall follow them that believe that's God's requirement and God requires you to believe his word job node that he hadn't done it that he wasn't the guilty one he was sure that he had met God's requirement and he stood Pat on it that's it he knowed he had confessed his sins and called for God to try him searching and see if there was anything wrong see God was just waiting to see what job would do because Satan had said I'll make him curse you to your face but God said are you all ready God said there's nothing there's none like him in the earth he won't do it God had confidence in him [Applause] can you see Matt he says maybe if you're healing it's a lingering a little bit God's got confidence in you that you'll hold on if you believe that the Holy Spirit the signs and the Wonders
