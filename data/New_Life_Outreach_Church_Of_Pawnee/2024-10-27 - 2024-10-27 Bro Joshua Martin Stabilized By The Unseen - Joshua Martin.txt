you can find someone you can and if you need some Pro I can tell you there is power power in [Music] pray well praise the Lord let us stand there is a direct line to the throne room but it takes some effort it takes some pressing you know I've told lots of the Bible says whatever you hand finds to do do it with all your [Music] heart when you put a lot into it when it means a lot when you got some money in it or like they the world will SA or you got some blood in the game amen just to show the Lord that you mean business CU he means business this morning and he wants us to come into his throne room this morning but you're going to have to press into it like Paul said press towards the prize toward the mark for the prize of the high calling in Christ Jesus how many's willing to press this morning amen you're going to have to push out Satan out of your mind so easy to get [Applause] distracted so easy to get distracted in our minds and our Spirits amen but I believe God wants to talk to us this morning greatest desire I believe is for him to talk to his children this morning right now amen let's not put it off for another day we've got a God God called man to come preach the gospel amen let's get into the spirit get past the carnal things of this mind and and the flesh I don't know why I'm going on and on this morning you forgive me if I'm rattling but the time is short we need to get more desperate I'm speaking to Merl Applegate this morning to get more desperate for the things of God and less for the things of this world Amen do you feel that way this morning amen as the man of God comes amen let's just sing this this chorus amen it was on my heart this morning so I better sing it amen you're still Lord amen I don't have a key brother Kobe amen amen you're still Lord you're still my my father oh I like it now and little Lord much I still need your touch cuz you are still Lord oh he wants to show us this morning that he's still Lord [Music] you're still my [Music] father you'll always be mine for all of time I wonder if we could get every hand in the building lifted to our Lord this morning oh you're still Lord [Music] all our your [Music] touch still Lord your still [Applause] [Music] Lord [Music] father ways be M for all the time you're still [Music] Lord amen do you believe that this morning he's still Lord forever more and I'm so thankful that we have a promise that he'll never change he'll never leave us he'll never forsake us but thaty same Lord will be with us to the end of the world and I believe that's something we can grab a hold of and anchor it in our lives in our soul that he's the unchangeable God Amen you happen to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen if you have your Bibles let's open our scriptures to 2 Corinthians [Music] 4:15 amen I believe we can come with an expectation to receive something from the Lord you know hearing brother Merl talk um I was listening to I think it was looking to the Unseen I believe and brother brandom he talks about how when MAA got that ulcer and how they he grabbed her hand and the rations Came Upon her hand his hand and he says you know I've seen it on other people but it was different when it was my own family and that really struck me that it's different whenever you need something from God you know whenever he needed God to come and heal her it was a little different then it was different from praying for somebody you didn't know you beli God could do it but when it comes to your own family and I can say Lord I'm making my expectation personal this morning I need something from God Amen I trust that's your attitude this morning 2 Corinthians 4:15 for all things are for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many re re redown to the glory of the Lord for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light Affliction which is for but for a moment worketh for us as a a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory why we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temp Al but the things which are not seen are Eternal amen are you grateful for that this morning can we bow our heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord how we love you Lord and we're we're thankful for your your mercy God and your your grace that you've given us in this in this day Lord we ask that you would be in this part of the service father we've sang songs Lord and we've did our best to create an atmosphere for you to feel welcome Lord God I feel I I pray that you would feel welcome today in this portion of the service God As I Lay myself into your hands I ask that you would speak to the needs speak to the hearts father Lord you can still change circumstances you can still heal the sick father we ask that you would move among us today we commit the service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen you may be seated this morning and just a simple subject I I would have and it would be stabilized by the Unseen and brother brandom and and I've been going through a lot of the messages brother Brandon preached and look way to Jesus looking to the Unseen look uh Look Away to Jesus so a lot of what I'm going to be ministering gone will be out of those tapes but look away to Jesus brother Brandon would say cuz we got a prayer line coming up and many are standing their rooms and around the walls and so forth and I know I know you it's very hard on you and and I stood many a time myself and I passed by a while ago bringing the wife down and I noticed the people around the doors and I thought who says the gospel still isn't the most attractive thing there is in the world World sure it is it attracts those who are interested in it those who are not interested of course they don't they it won't be but Jesus said if I be lifted up I would draw I'll be lifted up from the earth I would draw on men unto me how true this is and and I like how brother brandham says that who says the gospel still ain't the most attractive thing in the world and I believe that as a minister we have an incredible opportunity to point the people to the greatest attraction I believe when the minister gets up to preach we're not pointing to a gift or a personality or or or a vision so to speak but we're pointing them to the greatest attraction and that is Jesus Christ and I believe the reason you're attracted to the message is because you've recognize that this is something different you've recognized that this is more than just a word this is more than just a message but there's the superatural that backs it up you know brother Brandon would talk about the Rich Young Ruler and would say why didn't he go to the priests and ask for eternal life was because he knew they didn't have anything so he came to the one who did have something to give and I believe the reason this gospel is the most attractive thing there is is because it's different even the world can testify we might not be able to live it but still there's something different about the pony Church you know there's something different about and they have something that I don't have and I believe this message has brought the enen world into or the Unseen World to a visible where we can see it in reality where the supernatural has been brought into manifestation and God has chose preachers to spread this message and brother Brandon would say now God could have chose to preach the gospel by the Sun by the Moon by the Stars by the wind or by nature but he chose men to preach the gospel and that's where the voice of God will come from and you can judge the voice according to the word it expresses then you can see what kind of voice that you're listening to if it's contrary to the word don't listen to it but if it is the word of God then God is Duty bound to back the word up and vindicate it and make it the truth because he promised to do it so we're living in a great day these words of Christ expressed and I love that at the end of it these are the words of Christ expressed and how are they being expressed by a preacher so when a preacher gets up and preaches he's pointing you to the greatest attraction that the Unseen can be made visible in your life not just something we talk about but it's a reality pointing you to something that can change circumstances pointing you to something that can change marital problems pointing you to something that that that can change the the situation that you are in but it's been and God is Duty bound to back it up and I like how the Bible would put it in Mark 16 and 20 and they went forth preaching everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following so all they had to do was preach the word and God would do the rest and that takes that that takes the pressure off of a Preacher to try to bring the results the Bible says they went and preached everywhere and the Lord went with them and confirmed the word with the signs and I believe if we can just preach the gospel preach the message then the Lord would back it up if somebody is attracted to it then God is Duty bound to bring forth the results you believe that this morning the disciples in the Bible Jesus would tell them take no note on what you will say but in the hour the Holy Spirit would give you inspiration and so when the word comes forth It's not the word of a man but I believe it's God coming and inspiring the word to bring forth results and I believe a true God preacher he digs into the message and he brings more than just sermons he brings more than just quotes and scriptures but I believe he's bringing the Unseen into a visible world uh just just bear with me a few minutes as I as I try to lay my Foundation like I said I I've been going through the messages look and and a lot of these things are from it and the Bible would say in in Acts 28:31 preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence and so a man of God gets up with all confidence because it ain't him that he's preaching but he's preaching concerning Christ and I believe and this goes for anybody not just preachers before you can before you can testify of something you got to have confidence in what you're testifying of right brother Brandon would tell us whenever he was selling the lamps he he would go and he would have a different approach he would say here you take the lamp for a week or or whatever it was and if you like it you can buy it he was confident that the product would sell itself oh man I'm confident that this message will sell itself cuz it is the most attractive thing that is upon the Earth and it attracts those who are interested in it and I believe that whenever a preacher gets up and preaches he's preaching by a vision and this really and and brother Andrew Glover was preaching up at brother Jonathan here a couple weeks ago at their at their uh convention and this really stood out to me that when you don't see victory for yourself the preacher sees it for you and brings it in a way where you can see it and you see I've experienced that whenever I've been down I've been discouraged I've been low and can't feel like I can take another step and A God Called preacher gets up and he preaches the promises and all of a sudden what he's preaching you connect with and you start to realize well when I did not feel like I could go on the preacher brought in a attaction where I could see Victory and I believe when sometimes when you can't feel or see Victory the preacher gets up and he sees victory for you and he preaches over your circumstances he preaches over your trials he preaches over what you're going through and he lifts you up where you can see over the things that are bringing you down and can see victory for yourself oh when you don't feel like you're a Christian he brings the promises and something strikes that I can't help but make this Rapture even when I don't feel like it it's an attraction that is attracting you and bringing you to the promises of God oh my brother Brandon would say now Lord as I spoke tonight of David with the little slingshot he was interested in the father's sheep and no matter how little it was he was ready to display and to conquer with what little he had to conquer with and you was with him Lord I am coming after these sheep tonight they've been sick I've obeyed your Commandments you showed your presence your willingness you've healed them with cards without cards showing that you are here and you never fail you're the UN thepresent God and I'm coming to challenge the devil that would keep them behind the sound barrier of unbelief now that I prayed them through tonight I break the way with the word of God and set them free in the name of Jesus Christ I bring them back to Faith come out of Satan so how would he break away for the people to see Victory it was him preaching the gospel oh come on now and that's what a preacher does he gets up and when all you see is a stone wall when all you see is circumstances all you see is failures a gospel preacher gets up and he breaks away through the barrier so that you can step on the other side the trial and see victory for yourself oh Hallelujah and I'm going to stand as a little David and say I don't care what you're going through God is interested in you seeing Victory not just the preacher seeing Victory God wants you to see Victory he wants you to have joy he wants you to have peace and Little David said I don't care how little the Sheep is I am interested in them seeing Victory oh when the little sheep could not see Victory David seen victory for them oh you might not feel like you can overcome this morning but God sees victory for you you might not feel like you can take another step through depression but God sees victory for you and he sent the preacher this morning to let you know that I see victory for you as well and you can experience the attraction of Victory this morning oh Hallelujah I break the way with the word of God and set them free and what was he setting them free to come to back the faith and I think that is so incredible that brother Brandon would get up and he and he he he he would use Des arment he would use the the healing of the hand but the third pole was more than just a gift it was Christ right it was the word coming and letting the people know that I have come to the Earth to bring a deliverance and the Bible would tell us in Isaiah 61 And1 The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the me can he sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound and it's incredible cuz brother Brandon would say if he Jesus was here in a Corporal body he could not heal you because he already healed you and he and I love how brother Brandon would say it he would say he didn't claim to be anything special he just preached the gospel oh ain't that incredible and the Bible says the Lord God hath anointed me to preach good Tidings so when the body of Jesus left the anointing didn't leave with him but the same anointing that anointed Jesus to see Victory and to preach Victory to the people is the same anointing that is here today proclaiming Liberty proclaiming Victory proclaiming joy and peace even when you don't see it yourself there's an anointing that says I break away by the word of God so that you can see victory for your yourself so you can see a Revival for yourself so you can see joy for yourself even when you don't see it for yourself there's an anointing that says it's for you Hallelujah there's anointing that says it's for you and it's a gospel preacher oh I love how brother Brandon puts it he could have anointed a rock to preach the gospel he could Anointed The Stars to preach the gospel but he anointed a preacher and it's the preaching of the word that breaks away for victory to come through oh my and I believe when God calls a message preacher and he gets behind the sacred desk he's seeing things for you and he's showing what you need to achieve victory for the Brandon would say you know evil things travel at night snakes and bugs all kinds of insects they fly at night because it's evil but let the sunrise and they take a dark place just as hard as they go why they are of the darkness they don't want the light that's the way the world is getting today it doesn't want the real the real true Gospel Light the real light of God shows a man's needs so whenever a gospel preacher gets up and he starts to preach the gospel he's letting you know what you need to achieve Victory and he starts to break away through the barriers of doubt he breaks the way through barriers of unbelief so that you can have faith to achieve your Victory you see and it's the true Gospel Light that has started starting to to break away and brother Brandon would tell us when Noah started to preach it was going to rain God had already showed him to build an ark so before he ever started to preach it is going to rain he had a way of Escape that he was seeing so whenever he would get up and preach he wasn't just pointing them to a canoe he wasn't pointing them to to to a little boat the denominational boat but he was pointing them to an unseen way of Escape you see the people couldn't see it at the time he wasn't built yet it would take a predestinated moment for them to get in that boat it took a 120 years and right now you might not see your rapture you might not see your body change but we're pointing you to Something in the Unseen realm that is going to be made visible oh so even though Noah's wife might not have seen the boats he didn't have the vision like Noah had but he was so convinced that this is the truth he would tell her and talk to her get us boys together and would say hey it's going to rain but God is given us a way of escape and I'm so and I just love when a preacher gets up and he gets so infused he gets so anointed and he starts to let you know that the promises of God are realities and whenever you can't see it you look at the anointing and say wow this is something that I can grasp even though I might not be able bble to see it there's an anointing that is pointing me to something of Deliverance oh hallelujah it's pointing me to something of Deliverance and brother Brandon would say this and when you hear the word it's usually somebody he was talking about look when you hear the word look it's usually somebody trying to get you to see what they are looking at and they say to you look going down the road you you someone might see a certain scene and they would say look and then Express what it is it's a mountain or a cactus whatever they're looking at but the first thing to get your attention is look and I love it he brother brandom says they say look they see a certain scene but you can't see it yet cuz you're looking in a different direction so what he would do is would say look and once he gets your attention then he starts to express what he sees oh Hallelujah and that's what a gospel preacher does he says look and then starts to express what inspiration has brought to him oh that's why we need inspirational preachers not just some theology that gets up in a dry sermon but we need inspiration to come and anoint preachers and point you to something that they see in the Unseen realm and say you can achieve it as well even though you don't see it there's Victory there's a cactus there's a mountain But first you got to look in the same direction that but I am looking then you can see it as well oh Hallelujah you got to get in the same thought pattern get in the same direction and when you get in that same channel then you can start to see what that person is seeing and I believe if we all get on the same channel that the prophet was in we can start seeing the supernatural not just the preacher not just the pastor not just the deacons but everybody can get in the same channel the same inspiration and look at the same promises and they're not just empty promises that that that we can achieve but we see them by understanding and realize that they are mine they are Y and amen oh Hallelujah you got to look at something and you're going to focus on something we're living in a day where you can look at anything right you can build your family around anything you can build your family around fear you can build your family around complexes you can build your family around an unstable or you can build your family upon the Unseen but the Brandon would say this where where if you look at with your eyes and you see now that a nation is shaking and trembling War clouds are flying everywhere every nation under is distressed and perplexion of time every sign that Jesus said would happen is happening there would be signs in the heavens above and in the earth below and great things that would be taking place like the flying saucers and Mystic things taking place but he commanded to to his church to lift up their heads in that day and to look up for the Unseen Christ will be appearing pretty soon so if we walked by only by sight we would be Children Of Darkness sure enough but I'm so glad to know there was a light that shines in every believer's Hearts so here brother brand he he's dramatizing it that we are seeing the things that Jesus spoke of but then he commanded the church not suggested but he commanded to look what are we looking at the Unseen his appearing oh Hallelujah brother the brand tell us there's a difference between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ right he says he's appeared now in the fullness of his power so Jesus would command the church to look for the Unseen is appearing oh Hallelujah so we're not just looking at a gift we're not just looking at prophecies we are looking at the Unseen that has made himself visible in this generation that you can build families upon you can build your marriage upon you can build and expect Revival for your teenagers expect Revival for your marriage we're looking at the Unseen that has been made visible in this generation oh Christ is now appearing in the fullness of his power we done it just your word we got the power with the word you see I don't want just a dead letter I want the power with it come on now I don't want just the theology I want something that can keep my mind when I'm going through depression I want something that can keep my marriage when we're having problems I want some power that would keep my teenager in the rebellious years don't just give me theology don't just give me quotes give me something that is stable that can stabilize me when I go through the valley of the shadow of death I feel something that is an anchor on the inside don't give me to some theology give me some Power give me some Authority with it oh Hallelujah brother the Brandon would preach a message called looking under Jesus and would say what do you see when you look oh so you look but what are you seeing but the Brandon would say the Bible says uh we don't we do not see all things but we do see Jesus that's who I want to see I want to see see him and how do I see him in the fulfilling of his promises oh we don't see all things but we do see Jesus Oh My let me be have that attitude I don't see all things but I do see one thing that is the Supreme one I see the authority that has come to the bride but you see what do you see when you look and I think it's so incredible that you got to catch what you're looking at cuz brother brandom says you look with your eyes but you see with your heart right and what does that mean to see with your heart it means to understand right cuz brother Brandon would tell us when Nicodemus come to Jesus and says what must I do right and he says You must be born again and he says unless you're born again you could not see the kingdom of God and brother Brandon would say the word see means to understand so you look with your eyes you look at the message but you got to go from just looking you've got to go to seeing which is to understand and that's how you get stabilized by the Unseen it's not looking at the word but getting an understanding that even though I go through the valley of the shadow of death by understanding I fear no evil ca the Unseen is walking with me oh you may feel like you're going through a drought this morning quit looking at the visible world and looking to the Unseen the promise if you seek me you will find me if you knock the door will be open you may say brother joshh I need a Revival look into the Unseen you may say I need healing for my body look into to the Unseen not empty promises but by understanding you realize that they are mine oh then you get on the same you get on the same channel with the preacher right that this ain't just no more sermons it's understanding that he's bringing to me oh if we ever get that Revelation that the preacher when he gets behind the desk it's it's more than just empty sermons but it's understanding bringing to you the Unseen oh that you can look and say wow that's what he's talking about that is understanding where I can see brother Brandon would say this here oh brother when you see the Gospel Light what difference does sickness death or anything else mean ain't that incredible when you see the Gospel Light not with eyes but understand so whenever you understand the Unseen what difference does the seen world mean I think that is so powerful that the reason many people is up and down up and down is because they're looking through natural eyes and natural circumstances natural problems natural chaos and they fail to see that in the Unseen there are some more promises that you can achieve oh Hallelujah cuz brother Brandon would tell us that people look at the word naturally but he says you're literally he says that's not the way you're supposed to look at it he says you look at it literally but then the word declares itself spiritually so we're not just supposed to look at letters naturally with eyes but we need to go beyond looking at it and understanding it cuz brother Brandon must say the word is a seed and he says it needs the Holy Ghost to water the seed so whenever you look at the word it plants the seed but you need an unseen Force to come and water the seed to make it live so it's more than just looking naturally we need the supernatural to come and make it live that's why we need more than just theology we need something to make the word live that's what the denominations have they've got theology right they've got word they got word word but where's the anointing to come and make it live right where's the supernatural that can take drug addicts and make them saints for God that can keep marriages together that's what this message has brought to you is not just word it's brought the mighty Angel it's brought the anointing to make the word live Hallelujah it is brought understanding where the Unseen is not just an imagination but it's a reality oh Hallelujah we don't see with their eyes we see with the heart and brother Brandon would tell us we are told that we have outward man and inward man and the outward man looks by his eyes the inward man walks by faith so we have to be led by one of these two persons outside outward man is inward man is God you see we do not see with her eyes though many times we thought we see with our eyes we only look with our eyes we see with our heart and he so he says we're going to be walking by one of these two people it's going to be the inward man or the outward man and he would say in another place that the God wants to lead man but he but there's a war that goes on between God and man because man is constantly looking at the things he can see and he says when you look at the things you can see your emotions or your control tower and I thought my that is so incredible we're living in a day where the emotions are up and down up and down up and down you wake up in the morning you don't feel like you're may you can make it depression is on the Rampage anxiety is on every teenager on every marriage we're living in a day where the emotions are controlling the people cuz they're walking by by the wrong SS they're walking by what they see and their emotions are controlling their salvation their emotions are controlling their Destiny but if you can change your sight from naturally to understanding your emotions may go up and down but you're stabilized by what you understand oh your emotions may tell you that you don't feel good and you you're going to go through depression you close the shades and go lay in bed and never see the sunlight again your emotions try to bring you down but the soul the inward man don't look and are controlled by the emotions they're controlled by the Unseen World oh that Soul it may go through hard times but it is stabilized by the Unseen oh man brother Brandon would tell us that God took man's heart which is led by faith and and the devil took man's head which is led by by emotions I'm not talking about no natural emotions by dancing or or speaking in tongues I'm talking about the inward emotions when you wake up in the morning and you don't feel like you're a Christian how many's ever been there you wake you go to bed feeling you're on cloud nine you feel like you're going to make a Rapture nothing can stop you but you wake up the next morning you don't even feel like you're saved it's emotions that is up and down up and down and if you're looking naturally those emotions will control you but if if you look at the right thing your emotions has no control over you you see but the it's easy sometimes to walk by emotions brother Brandon talks about Jonah and would say that that Jonah just won the city the size of St Louis you remember I'm talking about that he says Nineveh was the size of St Louis and he just W them to God right after that he walks up to a mountain and says God take my life what was it was emotions it was emotions and that that's what happens many times after a meeting after a good church service man you're in Revival but then you step out and all of a sudden here comes the emotions nobody loves you nobody likes you you're not going to make a Rapture but that's the time to be stabilized and see I don't care what the emotions say I got one one destination and that is what the Unseen has brought me oh brother Brandon would talk about Elijah and would say he would go through emotions youall remember that he says he he would go to Mount Carmel and he would call fire from heaven he would kill 450 priests to bail now he's running from a woman and he says Lord I'm the only one that is left of your profits just take my life his emotions were were were completely contrary to the reality of the Unseen cuz what would God say God would say I've got 7,000 oh I'm preaching now I've got 7,000 his emotions were pointing him away from the reality that Jehovah was seeing and God's got promises for you but your emotions will push you away from those promises where you're saying I can't make a Rapture I can't make a Rapture and here God is saying I've got a Rapture for you oh would you notice what would change Elijah's eyesight was an angel oh and I love here would come an angel and would starts to rub his shoulders and you know what that angel would do the Bible says he gave him strong me e to eat so even though his emotions was preaching contrary here come an angel with the message that can say I don't care what the emotions are telling you that is not the truth and we've had an angel with the message in this generation that has brought strong meat and has let you know it don't matter what your emotions say that is not the reality of the Unseen oh Hallelujah your emotions might be telling you that you're teenager is never going to be saved but that's a lie from the pits of hell and there are some strong meat letting you know this morning that look into the Unseen you will see the realities hallelujah oh the outward man is trying to lead you by your emotions which makes you unstable so he needed something to bring a stability and brother Brandon would say this and Christ revealed in his own word he says now in my text this morning is is Christ revealed in his own word now where I come to the conclusion to talk on this was because that knowing we mustn't say we mustn't say uh just say because we're gathered together just halfheartedly to speak on something but it's something that will stabilize the people for we are going to pass through dangerous and treacherous Waters we are already sailing through them and sometimes I guess it's with you like it is with me and so here's a prophet letting you know those same Troubled Waters that you going through he went through and that incredible he says I guess it is with you like it is with me that it seems like that so much of it it just gets scary so here stands a prophet letting you know that the visible world the treacherous Waters you're going through all a scary thing and it's because it was a scary thing he says I'm not just coming halfheartedly just to preach you something but I'm bringing something to stabilize you and what was he preaching Christ revealed in his own word and then whenever I read that man I that did my heart so good what was he doing he was revealing the unseen to bring stability even in the treacherous Waters that you go through Christ has been revealed the Unseen has been revealed that even though you go through scary times you can be stabilized oh even when you go through hard times you can BR you can be stabilized it was the unveiling of God bringing the Unseen to be visible brother Brandon would say this were the last days the last hours of the days do you seek him now in his word and all of his word made manifest right before us oh Church of the Living God get to your feet and believe him with all that is in you hold to that little wheel at the the the wheel in the middle of the wheel let it stabilize every move every motion that you will make every thought that you have may it be controlled by the tower that is inside of you because God is setting right in his word of this hour in the evening light showing forth is light he says stay get stabilized by what God is doing and what is he doing God is setting in his word letting you know that he's unveiling himself he's revealing the unseen and it's so incredible that if you can never get a glimpse of the Unseen it brings a St it stabilizes you right you know Austin if I told you that I got you a new drum set back from the office it's great in things but there's a door that's closed right you don't know what there I could be just speaking of something you know I'm going to I'm just going to hope this is okay brother Joe brother Joe was talking about how he's going to he's smoking some meat and how he's going to get a business going and Austin says are you just a dreamer or is this really going to happen you know right now it's dreams he thinks it's a dream but once he starts to bring it into motion and enails this plan it goes from more than a dream to realization and you see God has been unveiled or been veiled up in our imaginations oh yeah he's a million miles away he's this he's that but in this generation God has brought his plans into manifestation where it's more than just dreams it's more than just a Million Miles Away but it's been brought into reality and now that can stabilize every question oh it stabilizes every doubt it stabilizes every negative thought that comes against you you see you I remember I talked on a I talked on uh the the Chariots of Fire last time I preached but Al brother brand and put him he says because Elijah was used to walking by faith he was looking at the Unseen all the time and he knew that God had said in the Psalms the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him that was enough for Elijah but brother Bram is putting it that Elijah didn't even see the Angels oh hope you're hearing me now he didn't even see them but understanding told him it was there oh so visibly in the seen world he could not see Victory but he knew victory was already there and you might not see it this morning but victory is already here if you can just understand it that the word promised that he would be with you no matter what you go through in the scen realm in The Invisible World God is there every step of the way the stabilizing something oh could you imagine the young boy walking into the tent saying Elijah were surrounded and he stops and he says more are with us than with them there was a question mark it was an empty promise it was something in the imagination but as soon as the prophet would say open this Poor Boy's eyes what happened his eyes would come open to the Unseen realm and it was still invisible to the syrians right the syrians couldn't see it but this boy by understanding could see that the promise that the word spoke of was it was in manifestation even though nobody else can see it oh the world might not see the Rapture the world might not even see but there's a sound of mind but you see it the devil's coming against you hounding your mind hounding your body but you can look into the Unseen and you can see that this is a reality and what I love about about that in Psalms 34:7 the angel of the Lord encampeth around about them that fear Him and deliverthat angels that was there but he knew they was going to deliver him oh you see we don't just got empty promises there's Authority behind the promises that brings it into action he knew if the Angels were there they they were going to deliver him from every snare that the syrians could put in front of him and oh my we didn't just get Christ as an onlooking angel we got somebody a person in this generation that has brought his authority he brought his power to let you know that no matter what you go through I will bring you through it you may go through mind battles but I'll bring you through it you may go through back pain but I'll bring you through it Hallelujah who Hallelujah brother Brandon would say this where two or three are gathered together in his name there he is in their midst not only in the midst as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but there he stands expressing exactly what he is the life and sustainer and so he's saying here stands Christ he's he's talking about Revelations how he was standing in the midst of the golden candlesticks and brother brand says we don't need to look back and wish we was there because Christ is here and he says he's not here as a complacent onlooker or as a recording Angel but he is here expressing he's expressing himself he's expressing himself as the peace in the valley he's expressing himself as the sound of mind he's expressing himself as all of these attributes that was in the mind of God now he's expressing itself brother Brandon would say this when a man once catches the vision of the unvisible god and know that he's always present there's something that stabilizes the man's thinking it stabilizes his actions and in the times of distress and trouble it'll still make him look upward above the things oh man this is powerful friends above the things that are happening around him because he's looking at the Unseen how is he looking by the Unseen he says he's looking at the Unseen yet by promise oh he's looking out a promise instead of the troubles brother brandom says if a man ever catches a vision of the unvisible it stabilizes his actions it stabilizes his thinking now that's where the Battleground is right the greatest battle is ever fought is right in the mind that's where the devil's coming that's where emotions flare up and he says it's stay stabilizes the man's thinking so the Battle Ground that the Devil Comes against God stabilizes it and even though he's going through troubles he looks above the troubles to the Unseen by a promise oh when I read that friends man that did did me so good that here he is you know David would say that he would he would bring forth a table in the presence of his enemy was God bringing a table no he was letting him know that he is with me if in the time of trouble in the time of natural enemies oh Hallelujah in the time of natural enemies he was looking to the Unseen saying I have Fellowship even in the midst of natural circumstances I'm still having fellowship with the Unseen even though you go through natural hard times you're still having Fellowship in the Unseen oh Hallelujah you're still having Fellowship you're still get strength you're still marching gone every step of the way naturally you don't see it but understanding says it's here oh brother Brandon would say if the Unseen one will declare himself visible then it ought to make your soul past every barrier your soul he didn't say nothing about your mind he says your soul cuz remember your soul is your soul is saved but your mind is never saved right you still battle contrary thoughts concerning the word you still have lustful thoughts you got to battle but he so he didn't say your mind he says your soul he says if your soul could ever get a glimpse of the Unseen it makes it go past every barrier and if your soul could ever get stabilized then it stabilizes your thinking it stabilizes your actions come on now you know I've quoted them many times but but the brandom says many people say that the devil made me do it he says no the devil didn't make you do it you just never was born again right cuz says if you're born again the only way the devil can get to you is to repent be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost and then he's your brother right if you're soul is ever secured and stabilized it stabilizes your actions it stabilizes your thinking it stabilizes you're speaking even when negative thoughts arise you're stabilized and you say no that's contrary to the word of God oh Hallelujah don't allow your emotions to try to control your soul don't allow your emotions even when your soul is secured emotions are still going to pop up right emotions is still going to try to bring down in your soul but don't listen to the emotions hope this is okay this morning don't listen to those things but go past every barrier with the soul that's what this message is after is your soul right it's not after your mind your mind's never saved but if the message could ever go from the mind to the soul then you're stabilized so if the the message if your soul could ever get past every barrier and start to SAR in this message oh the heights is open for you come on now the heights is Open Heavens is open up for you the Supernatural is opened up to you brother Brandon would say this and I'm told that who who fly these here these real fast jet planes and they say that the plane getting up to a certain speed that it vibrates and it shakes and it seems like the boats are going to fly out of him that the wings are going to come off and they they tell they pass the sound barrier but once they pass the sound barrier they say the plane just sells out just in ease when it passes the sound barrier that the obstacle that is in the way of the plane when it passes its own sound then it runs at ease I love that when it passes its own sound but before it passes its own sound it feel like it feels like the the the wings are going to fall off right he says it feels like the boats are going to fall off how come it's own sound it's pushing against it oh come on now that's where many Christians are they can't get past their own emotions they can't get past their own thinking they can't get past their own ideas and it feels like they can't make it that's why when you get up you man I can't make a Rapture cuz you're still hitting the barrier of your emotions but if you can ever get past that brother brandom says the plane runs at ease oh you see Christianity it's pretty easy once you get past the barriers then you run at ease when the devil says you're not going to make it you say oh no I'm already passed that when the devil says you're not good enough I'm already pass that when the devil says you know your past mistakes I'm already passed that I'm past my own barriers and I'm soaring in the heights of the Unseen I say little church rise above every barrier rise above every circumstance rise above every emotion and Sor am Heights of the Unseen and you can see that he's still Jehovah Gyra he's still the Lord that heals he's still the god that delivers he's still God Mighty in battle hallelujah it's the Unseen that has stabilized me has stabilize me even though I'm going through treacherous Waters I'm stabilized hallelujah oh we don't look at the scene cuz those things are temporal we look at the Unseen for those things are eternal oh Hallelujah brother Brandon M sayah oh if the Church of this day could ever pray till it passes the sin barrier and the unbelief barrier they could shout the victory of a living God and when they once passed the barrier how and he tells us how to pass the barrier if they once passed the barrier by looking to the Unseen and letting the world vibrate and do what it wants to do in other words we have no dealings with the world if if America's going to go down the tubes let her do it let them vibrate Let Them Fall Apart let that marriage fall apart but it's for me in my house let that one go down in unbelief let that one criticize the Unseen let that one say this the message is false let them vibrate but as for me I'm pass that barrier how by looking at the Unseen oh Hallelujah then you can shout the victory yes then you can shout the victory remember the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness once your past your own sounds then you put on that garment what is that garment it's the Unseen then you realize that you're wrapped in the Unseen and there's no way the devil can get to your soul he can try to plag your emotions but he can't get to the soul you see brother brand would say this here if you if you if you look to the Blessed word that says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and turn your heads towards that and press on until you pass the vibration past the unbelief barriers the sin barriers all the barriers that seem to hinder you then you'll fly free in the faith of God knowing that all things are possible and there's then they say there's no limits hardly to the speed that the plane will go if there's no limits to the speed that the plane will go there's no limits to the blessings that the God will pour upon the believer that will believe so if there's no limits to the to the speed and to the heights of a plane that gets past the barrier what about you come on brother Brandon will tell us there's untapped resources right there's no limits to the victories you can achieve you know brother Harry was telling me something about a Sunday school lesson about striking the ground you know here he only struck the ground three times and he he had unlimited victories unlim mited he had unlimited resources but he would only strike the ground three times and little church you've got unlimited resources you've got unlimited victories you got you got you got Heights for joy and for peace but if you can ever get past the barriers oh there there's no limits of the blessings of God that that that uh that will pour upon you no wonder the Apostle Paul could say oh death where is your sting oh grave where is your Victory and he then he points to something and just love it and he says but thanks be to God who give us the victory so he's pointing to the Unseen right thanks be to God the Unseen which give us the victory through Jesus Christ so what was Jesus it bridged the gap between the seen and the Unseen it was natural man but Supernatural God so here stood something that would bridge the gap between the the Unseen and the visible and even though Paul was going through Vis visible circumstances he would point to something tangible and would say this here has brought me the Victory and I believe this message has bridged the gap between the Unseen and the visible world that we can point to it and say this message is thus saith oh Lord and this is how I'm getting rapturing Faith oh grave where is your sting death where is your Victory but thanks be to God that has given us something from the unseen Hallelujah even though death was trying to bring him down he was still pointing to the Unseen get up with the brand would say that uh that Moses he says he endured looking at the Unseen and in the time of death he says the invisible come by and made himself visible he says the Angels come and was the Paw bearers he said it picked him up and went and buried him somewhere he says he walked by the Unseen and even in the time of death the Unseen was visible with him and oh one day when you when we laid down a sword for the last time you've endured the Unseen you've walked by faith walked by understanding but one day the invisible is going we're going to see the literal Jesus Christ the one that held her hand in the invisible world is going to show himself and say here these are the hands that led you this is the voice that spoke to you this is the one that encouraged Elijah you remember the one that brought your strong meate that was me Jacob you remember the angels that come down whenever you was at a a hard spot on Jacob's Ladder that was me oh Elijah you remember the one or or Abraham the one that you fellowship with that was me little bride the one that was the peach in the valley that was me the one that brought you through the heart times that was me the one that picked you up when you fell down and stumbled that was me remember the one that says you can make it when your emotions said you couldn't make it that was me you walk by the Unseen remember the time your heart was broken and you couldn't put the pieces together and to come back together that was me you remember when you felt all alone and you couldn't take another step that was me Hallelujah that was me even in the time of death the invisible made itself visible hallelujah oh oh Hallelujah it was job you know if anybody had a right to walk by emotions it was job right here job he was just living his everyday life man great life he had he had children he had a wife he had friends and brother Brandon would say everybody would come to him for Visions everybody he was a prophet so everybody would come to him everybody was his friend right if you have something that somebody wants man everybody's your friend and here on the time of trouble all of those friends he thought he had turned away his family his kids were taken away his Lively stalk was taken away his wife turned against him and yet here he stood stabilized he could he had every right to point and let the emotions rise up here come friends pointing to his emotions and he says no I'm not a secret Sinner and what is so incredible is what were these friends trying to do the friends were coming and saying he was a secret sinner right what what what would cover his sins the bloody sacrifice right so the very thing that stabilized job his friends were trying to get him to doubt have you ever thought of that before he he could sit there blameless because of the bloody sacrifice and here comes his friends saying you're a secret sinner but he knew he wasn't because of the sacrifice oh if the devil could ever get your emotions to get your so wacky and out of balance where you start to doubt the message and doubt the promises you're know you're going to sit there and you're going to fall into despair right you've got no hope outside of this message job had no hope outside of his sacrifice it was a sacrifice that gave him hope for his children right the Bible would tell us that he slay a sacrifice he slay a lamb for his children because they were at the party remember and he said pre-venture that they may sin he slay a land so this sacrifice was the only thing that was keeping hope for his children keeping hope for himself and this message is the only hope you got for your children it's the only hope that you got to see loved ones that went on the other side don't let the devil come and get you unstable on this message oh here job stood his emotions could have FL flared up but he says now he kept him in check and what's so incredible he was walking by faith and all of a sudden he heard Thunders right the Bible tell us the Thunders will begin to blare all the all everybody else just heard Thunders but job heard more than Thunders he heard a voice and man we got people associated with the message all they hear was Thunders they're trying to figure out what the Thunders are we heard a voice right we're not waiting for somebody to come and interpret the Thunders we already got the interpretations it was the voice it was the message and here the Thunder would begin to blare he didn't just hear thunder he heard a voice and what would that voice do it would pick him up and lift him into the Unseen World and what is so incredible the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the Holy Name he's walking by faith but all of a sudden his faith lifted him up and he looked and he says I know my redeemer liveth and at that day oh Hallelujah at that day in my flesh I'll see God so even though he was going through present conditions the invisible World lifted him above present conditions and showed him that in that flesh he's going to see God oh Hallelujah your present conditions have no strongholds strong enough to keep you from going in fact to the mind of God oh then what would job say I've heard but now I see I've been walking by faith but now I've got a glimpse of the unvisible God we're walking by Faith by little church catch a vision of the Unseen World and let that Soul pass by every barrier oh Hallelujah I feel good this morning that you're not just hoping there's a Rapture but you see it oh you see it and say devil you don't got enough to keep me out of it I see it Hallelujah but what's what what I love about is job didn't wait until he seen the Fulfillment to Rejoice no he wasn't there yet but the glimpse of the Unseen was enough for him to rejoice it was enough to say oh man I'm going to be there you see too many times we try waiting for the Fulfillment of promises before we can thank God for it come on now even when you can't see it yet you can still thank God for it when you're still sick you you thank God for healing you don't wait for the Fulfillment you wait for the promise and when the promise is made clear to you by your understanding then you thank God for it then you rejoice now even more before blessed are they that have not seen right you have not seen it yet but you understand that it's yours and here he was he didn't wait for the Fulfillment all he had was a promise and you know brother brand would talk about Jonah and said Jonah refused to see any anything contrary he was down in the belly of the whale in the bottom of the sea but he said that won't hide me he said once more will I look toward your Holy Temple what was he looking at catch this now what was he looking at he actually couldn't see the temple but he seen the promise made by the temple oh he didn't see it naturally but he was looking to a promise and the promise even though he was not in the Fulfillment yet cuz the Bible was saying that he would he would he would stop and praise God with Thanksgiving right he would praise God with Thanksgiving once he got a glimpse of a promise even though he was not in the Fulfillment yet he got a glimpse of the promise oh Hallelujah and he continues on oh God if we can only see the promise of the word the go go Christ has promised wherever two or three are assembled in my name I am in their midst and whatever they ask they shall receive if we could see it and the first move move right into it don't wait any longer what are you looking for he says what are you looking for and he says that whenever he seen the first move and he and he gives multiple examples he used them many times the first move and he he he tyes that first move to the promises of God he says once he seen the first move then he moved right into it he didn't see the Fulfillment he seen the first move of the pr PR oh we've got promises in this generation you have not seen the Fulfillment yet but you're enjoying the first move which is the promise that's coming to you and saying here's the Unseen oh Hallelujah brother brandom talks about whenever Jesus would Rite into the City and it's so incredible that here comes Jesus writing he's fulfilling scripture right he's he's upon the donkey riding to the riding into the City and here come the people that were coming and worshiping Jesus and here the Brandon would say the here here he comes riding into the city just exactly what the word said he would do riding on the little donkey coming into the city those who were not looking at the Creed not looking at the temple not looking at these other things not looking up the priest what they had to say those that believed him that were standing there with palm in their hand just waiting for the first move you never heard them say who's coming oh no they knew who was coming they knew knew what the word said they were waiting there with the first move the promise and whenever the Fulfillment came they recognized it oh Hallelujah brother brandom says who they came from the temple and it's so incredible he says they came from the temple not the unbeliever saying who is this man he says they said that because they weren't waiting for him but those who were waiting for him didn't say who is this they knew who it was oh we're not setting here saying what is the supernatural where's the supernatural we know the supernatural we're expecting the supernatural we don't come to church and say oh man I hope he's here we know he's here we got a promise we got the first move where two or three are gathered in my name I will be in their midst even when we're not in the Fulfillment yet we expect it and we wait for the Fulfillment here they stood Jesus said they already have the stuff in their brother brandom says they already have the stuff in their hand they were waiting to put it down on the ground because they knew prophecy was coming down the road they didn't wait could you imagine if they're sitting around and they waited for Jesus to enter into the city to grab the Palm right they would have missed him no they were waiting with anticipation they knew he was coming down they already was ready they grabbed the Palm they was ready they s there ready ready for their visitation and I say little church let's get ready for our visitation come on now we're not coming here out of Duty and what some incredible I know I'm running out of time but the brown say it brother the Brown says the the priest ran out to see the religious commotion was about and the people said who is this what were they there for friends a religious feast the very God that had them to ordain the feast told them that he would be there just like that and they cried who is it so here the reason that they're in the city in the first place was because God told him to do a feast and the Very one that told him to do the feast was coming into the city and they said who was it oh they took the words of God and made a tradition and since they made it a tradition they missed their visitation oh little church don't let us come to church out of a tradition come on and Jen God comes with his anointing with his word trying to bring a Revival trying to bring bring some stimulation trying to bring a fulfillment of promises but we're here out of tradition oh I'm preaching now but we're here and we say who is this oh it's another message by our pastor who is this another message by the by the Evangelist who is this but let us catch who it is it's more than a sermon it's the greatest attraction come on now it's more than just the sermon of Dos and dos it's the greatest attraction bringing you the invisible God and say here he is he's fulfilling the scripture here's the deity made visible riding upon a donkey just like the word said and it wasn't just any donkey it was a predestinated donkey it wasn't just any donkey we haven't just got any word we've got the predestinated word we haven't just got any pastor we got the predestinated pastor for this church you're not just sitting here by accident God predestinated you to be here today to be in py to be in church this morning how come he's fulf F in his word don't miss him don't miss him don't miss your Revival don't miss the Fulfillment oh give me a few more minutes brother Brandon would talk about would talk about how that uh uh let me find that let me find it here brother Brown would say this here uh he the first move at the pool of Bethesda they rushed and got into it amen oh the people here if you haven't received the Holy Ghost this morning if the first little tinkle would say that's the truth this man is telling the truth then hurry as quick as you can don't wait what what are you looking at what are you waiting for the hour is later than you think go get moving towards it as fast as you can why when Elijah saw the move he was talking about the the The Cloud of of a man's hand remember he says when Elijah saw the move it was the evidence of an answered prayer it did not seem like anything special he he he did not see he would tell tell Gaza go out there look he would go nothing there he says go look again nothing's there go look again it did not matter how small that cloud was he realized this was the answer to his prayer oh it don't matter how little the sermons are it could be the answer to your prayer come on now you may say brother Josh you're dragging us this morning it could be the answer it could be the answer to come and stabilize your emotions to stabilize your mind to stabilize your thinking you see I I don't believe that Wednesday night service is even when our pastor teaching on the church ages that could be an answered prayer right it could be some stability to come and bring understanding you see nothing happens by accident it could be an answered prayer for the brand say oh God I wish that every sick person here this morning that fills the holy spirit in our presence now could realize that's the evidence of a prayer you prayed has been answered in the presence of God every man that wants the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you feel that little Grand feeling saying I believe that's the truth if you take that that's the evidence of my answered prayer and he says raise up your hands and say God I receive it now something would take place and in all of this he's talking about the first move and he says it's the word coming forth and he says when the word comes forth and something Rises up and he says that's the truth he says that's your answered prayer not waiting for the Fulfillment but something recognizes this is what I'm praying for this is the peace I've been wanting this is the joy I've been wanting this is the Holy Ghost for my children I've been wanting if you can just recognize this is the greatest attraction little musicians come this is the greatest attraction coming to answer the prayer to answer the prayer I don't believe this message is a message of condemnation of dos and don'ts it's your answered prayer it's your it's your Revival it's your it's it's your deliverance it's your joy oh my you see he when the angel of the Lord would trouble The Waters at the pool of Bethesda that was an answered prayer for somebody but only that one person that could step into the water that was their answered prayer but what about the guy with the infirmity that sat there for what 38 years he was praying he was praying but yet he couldn't get there he just couldn't do it whenever he tried everything he could do and what's so incredible is the Angel didn't make himself visible the water would his trouble right so everybody else just got something invisible you know a wind could have went by and stir it I don't know but not this man this man had no doubts this wasn't an angel this wasn't a feeling this wasn't an emotion this was deity in flesh walking up bypassing everybody else and coming to answer his prayer oh when he couldn't when he couldn't do it enough when he didn't have enough strength strength would come to him whenever you couldn't look up God would lift you up when you couldn't take another step God would picked you up when you felt like yeah it was impossible and your emotions were controlling you here would come God and would say hey get a glimpse God would send a message in this generation and would say here's something you can point to that it's more than just a man it's more than just the invisible God here's reality here's the Messiah sign here's the Messiah sign we got so much Vindication that the Unseen is made visible and what what is so incredible is here at the right in of the sun here would come the two the two women to the tomb of Tomb of Jesus right they were coming and here Jesus was gone you would think that would be a Vindication that he was alive if he was there that that would have discouraged them this is the third day where's Jesus at you know but here stood the Vindication that he was gone he was alive the tomb was empty but they were looking at us the wrong way but here would stand an angel would say why seek the living among the dead oh we've got the greatest message with the greatest Vindication letting you know quit seeking the living among the dead don't let the emotions control you but here's the Unseen let's bow our heads tonight dear heavenly father Lord how we love you Lord Lord I pray that something was said this morning to encourage and uplift somebody Lord that we don't got to be controlled by your thoughts we don't got to be controlled by your emotions but Lord if we can just
