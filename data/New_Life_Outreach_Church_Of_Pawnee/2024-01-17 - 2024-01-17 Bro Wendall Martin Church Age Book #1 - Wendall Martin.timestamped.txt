[39:55] brought your church age books this is
[39:57] good and I'd encourage you to start
[40:00] bringing your church age books and and
[40:02] um instead of reading quotes and things
[40:04] off of my iPad um I'm going to start
[40:07] reading them out of out of the church
[40:09] age book and it's and I'm not just
[40:12] necessarily going to uh just just just
[40:15] read Page by page I want you to do that
[40:17] at home but I I I'm wanting to um um I
[40:22] want us to really start digging into
[40:24] some of these truths and and um and
[40:27] maybe start preaching out of some of
[40:29] these areas and so but for right now
[40:32] let's let's look here in the Book of
[40:34] Revelations the first chapter and um and
[40:38] the um the 20th
[40:42] verse
[40:46] amen it says the mystery of the Seven
[40:49] Stars which thou sawest in thy right
[40:51] hand and the golden candlesticks the
[40:54] Seven Stars or the the seven or are the
[40:57] Angels of the seven churches and the
[41:00] Seven candlesticks which thou saw us are
[41:04] the seven churches why don't we just uh
[41:07] stop there and let's go to the Lord in
[41:08] prayer father we want to thank you today
[41:11] for your love thank you for your many
[41:13] blessings that you have given us Lord we
[41:16] appreciate the songs of
[41:18] Zion we appreciate Lord the specials
[41:22] that were sung tonight and I I love you
[41:25] Lord with all of my heart I'm thankful
[41:29] as Sister Amy was singing that song
[41:33] the the history she gave the history of
[41:36] the church in that little song what what
[41:38] powerful
[41:39] meaning and and Lord we we we thank you
[41:44] for this great Revelation that you've
[41:46] given us I'm asking that you would open
[41:49] this Revelation up to us Lord Lord from
[41:52] the youngest to the oldest Lord from the
[41:54] least to the greatest and not just hear
[41:57] it with with our natural ears but Lord
[42:00] help us to really catch the revelation
[42:02] of what you are help us tonight father
[42:06] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[42:08] the church say amen amen and amen God
[42:12] bless you you may be seated here this
[42:15] evening so the church uh age book is is
[42:20] really is is very important the um amen
[42:24] it it gives this this church age book
[42:27] gives you the history of the
[42:30] church and and so when we look there in
[42:33] the book of uh Revelations the 2 and
[42:37] third chapters it deals with the seven
[42:40] churches amen so and these are these are
[42:45] seven uh uh John was commissioned to
[42:50] write this book of Revelations and then
[42:53] he was told to send them amen send a
[42:57] copy uh to each of the Seven Cities
[43:01] there were churches in those cities and
[43:04] they he was supposed he was commissioned
[43:06] to send these letters uh uh to the the
[43:11] seven the seven churches in these Seven
[43:14] Cities
[43:17] now not necessarily that these um cities
[43:22] were that these letters were to the
[43:25] cities but it was it was these cities
[43:28] had
[43:29] characteristics amen uh that described
[43:32] the spirit and the condition of of each
[43:35] one of the ages each one of the seven uh
[43:38] cities were had had special had had had
[43:42] specific conditions had specific
[43:45] histories that God would use when our
[43:49] Prophet came when the seventh messenger
[43:51] came amen and when the Lord would reveal
[43:54] to him uh these Church ages uh the you
[43:59] he would go back and and look into these
[44:02] specific cities and and we would find
[44:05] the condition of the Cities The Same
[44:08] Spirit was in these Church ages and so
[44:12] amen um uh brother Brenham would go into
[44:14] history so each one of these now this is
[44:16] made up of of you're if you were look um
[44:20] how many brought your church age book
[44:21] with you
[44:22] tonight amen so so U sister Kala don't
[44:26] you put uh the the the Candlestick up
[44:29] there and
[44:31] um and so at the very front of your of
[44:35] your church age book you will see now
[44:38] this this isn't going to look exactly
[44:41] like yours but it's a little bit easier
[44:43] uh to read uh and and so it you've got
[44:46] your you've got your Seven Ages now
[44:49] you're going to have brother brandham
[44:51] starts the book out with the with the
[44:53] revelation of Jesus Christ then the
[44:56] second chapter is the patmas vision and
[44:59] then he goes into the Ephesian Church
[45:01] age and so then he'll go through Ephesus
[45:05] samna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia
[45:09] leosia and then the resume of the ages
[45:13] and and that consummates it so um
[45:16] there's there's this thing has
[45:18] got this this has
[45:20] got everything that we believe I mean
[45:24] we're talking about
[45:26] predestination we're talking about um
[45:30] the serpent seed um uh eternal security
[45:35] uh I mean everything it it this is to me
[45:39] to me outside of the Bible this is the
[45:41] greatest book that has ever been written
[45:43] this is an incredible book um it's got
[45:47] history it's got it all in it and so I
[45:50] would encourage uh every one of you to
[45:54] to really really get get into this and
[45:58] and study it now I would say that it is
[46:02] you you can't read it really like a book
[46:05] because um uh it's not like you're
[46:07] sitting down and and reading a story I
[46:10] mean uh youve you've got to study this
[46:13] you brother BR you can you can spend
[46:15] weeks on one page literally you can
[46:19] spend weeks on one page as as you go
[46:22] through scripture because everything
[46:25] that we believe and everything that
[46:27] brother brandham taught us now remember
[46:29] this the the seven Church ages it was uh
[46:33] uh after after brother brandham had uh
[46:37] had taught the church ages and and and
[46:40] he had given this by inspiration the
[46:42] angel of the Lord told him how to how to
[46:44] draw that and and and then at the end
[46:48] when he was through writing it y y'all
[46:50] remember what happened at or at the end
[46:52] of the um of the services amen the the
[46:55] angel of the Lord came on the back wall
[46:58] and and and made every one of those
[47:01] exactly like brother brandom made it he
[47:04] just came in and started changing the uh
[47:07] changing the the white and the black and
[47:09] this that and the other done all seven
[47:11] of them right there people were figting
[47:13] the whole church seeing what what the
[47:16] angel of the Lord was doing so he was
[47:18] backing up the angel of the Lord was
[47:20] backing up what brother brandham had
[47:23] taught now now brother brandham couldn't
[47:25] make that stuff up he couldn't put a
[47:27] light back there and make that and make
[47:29] that all happen God came to vindicate
[47:33] what his Prophet taught and that's the
[47:35] reason I say Amen we want to get into
[47:39] this book here and and and dive into it
[47:42] for ourselves and that goes for you
[47:43] children too M if you want to uh even
[47:47] bring in some you know uh uh uh read a
[47:50] page or two for for school and and uh
[47:54] teach him in in those areas there I
[47:56] think it's a wonderful thing um so so
[47:59] brother Bram would he would give amen he
[48:02] he would he would give the
[48:04] characteristics of the church ages amen
[48:06] each age uh he has a
[48:09] messenger Jesus when every one of these
[48:12] uh messages that are given to the
[48:14] churches he he addressed it straight to
[48:18] the messenger of the age amen and then
[48:22] he gives him the message and then
[48:23] anoints him to preach it to that church
[48:26] age now uh then under the inspiration of
[48:30] God brother brandom also gave the dates
[48:33] and so you will see uh the the the the
[48:37] dates like Ephesus started in in ad. 53
[48:40] and went to 170 Samina went from 170 to
[48:44] 8312 and so you you can go on down there
[48:47] and of course our age started in
[48:49] 1906 and and so and each one of these uh
[48:53] churches uh God's given uh uh
[48:57] Commendation he's he's encouraging them
[48:59] and he's also getting on to them and
[49:02] tell them where they're failing and tell
[49:03] them what they need to do and and and
[49:06] and and all of these things here now but
[49:08] there is one thing that you're going to
[49:10] find in the in in the church is there in
[49:14] these Church ages is there's two spirits
[49:18] that that are at work God is wanting a
[49:21] Pentecostal church and Satan is doing
[49:25] everything he can to take away the power
[49:29] from that church amen that's what he
[49:31] wants to do and and so um and it's and
[49:36] it's God and Satan it just seems like
[49:38] amen and so this this book of Revelation
[49:42] and the and the inside of the Prophet it
[49:46] it exposes Satan for what he is and if
[49:48] you've got your church age book amen if
[49:50] you want to turn to the book uh uh 14
[49:52] just real
[49:53] quickly and um uh I I'm as I say tonight
[49:57] I'm not I we're just going to to I I
[50:00] want to talk on God's goal I want to
[50:02] show you the goal of this church and um
[50:06] amen and what God's got in his mind so
[50:09] there in in in page
[50:11] 14 and and down at the third paragraph
[50:15] so uh you you've got your when I say the
[50:18] third paragraph amen I'm not dealing
[50:21] with the one that that was connected
[50:23] with the one above but it's but it's one
[50:25] two 2 three all right and so it says in
[50:28] this Revelation he tells what the end of
[50:32] uh of the devil is he tells how he's
[50:35] going to deal with the devil and cast
[50:39] him into uh the see might yah and cast
[50:43] him into the Lake of Fire he reveals the
[50:45] end of the wicked ones who follow Satan
[50:49] and Satan hates that have you ever
[50:51] noticed how Satan hates two books of the
[50:55] Bible more than others than all others
[50:57] through liberal theologians and and
[51:00] pseudo scientists he is always attacking
[51:03] the Book of Genesis and the Book of
[51:06] Revelations in both of these books we
[51:08] find Satan's origin and and his his
[51:11] awful ways and his destruction that is
[51:14] why he attacks them he hates to be
[51:17] exposed in this in those books he is
[51:20] exposed for exactly what he is and Jesus
[51:25] said about Satan he has no part in me I
[51:29] have no part in him the devil would like
[51:32] to prove that different but he
[51:35] cannot so he does all he can to destroy
[51:39] the
[51:40] confidence in the word now I want you to
[51:43] catch this because brother brandom is
[51:44] laying this out there in the revelation
[51:46] of Jesus Christ the Satan is doing this
[51:49] all throughout the church ages he says
[51:51] but when the church disbelieves Satan
[51:54] and believe leaves the spirit's
[51:56] revelation of the word the Gates of Hell
[51:59] cannot Prevail against her now let me
[52:02] put in a word here for my own Ministry
[52:04] if you don't mind you all know that this
[52:06] gift in my life is Supernatural it is a
[52:09] gift whereby the holy spirit is able to
[52:12] discern diseases and the thoughts of
[52:14] men's hearts and other hidden things
[52:16] that only God could know and then reveal
[52:18] to me I wish you could stand with me and
[52:21] see the faces of the people when Satan
[52:24] knows he is going to be exposed now it
[52:26] isn't the people that I'm talking about
[52:29] it is that Satan has got a hold in their
[52:32] lives through sin indifference and
[52:35] disease but you should see their faces
[52:38] Satan knows he is going to be exposed
[52:40] and the most peculiar changes come over
[52:42] the people's countenance Satan is afraid
[52:45] he knows that the spirit of God is about
[52:47] to let the people know of his works that
[52:50] is why he hates meetings so these
[52:52] meetings so much when names are called
[52:55] and diseases revealed Satan hates it now
[52:58] what is this it's not the mind reading
[53:01] it is not telepathy nor is it witchcraft
[53:05] it is a revelation by the Holy Ghost and
[53:08] that is the only way I can know it of
[53:10] course the carnal mind will call it
[53:12] anything but the Holy Ghost but let me
[53:14] show you another reason why Satan hates
[53:17] this book of the revelation of Jesus
[53:18] Christ in the church he knows that Jesus
[53:23] Christ uh is the same yes yesterday and
[53:26] today and forever and he changes not he
[53:31] knows that a whole lot he knows that a
[53:33] whole lot more than 90% of the
[53:35] theologians he knows that since God is
[53:38] immutable in his nature then he is just
[53:41] as immutable in his ways thus Satan
[53:43] knows assuredly the original church at
[53:46] Pentecost with the power of God Mark 16
[53:50] and action is the true church that Jesus
[53:53] claims as his own all else is is false
[53:56] it has to be now remember Christ in the
[53:59] true church is a continuation of the
[54:01] book of Acts but the Book of Revelation
[54:04] shows how that the Antichrist would come
[54:07] into the church and defile it making it
[54:10] lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes
[54:14] Satan revealing his works the attempted
[54:18] destruction of God's people and the
[54:19] discrediting of God's word right down to
[54:22] the time he has cast into the Lake of
[54:24] Fire he fights that he cannot stand it
[54:28] he knows that if the people get the true
[54:31] Revelation somebody say true
[54:34] revelation of the true church and what
[54:38] she is what she stands for then she can
[54:42] do the Greater Works she will be what
[54:46] inin an invincible Army if they get the
[54:50] true revelation of the two Spirits
[54:52] within the framework of the Christian
[54:54] church and by God's spirit discern and
[54:57] withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan
[55:01] will be powerless before her yes now
[55:04] when Satan's telling you you can't be
[55:06] healed Satan's telling you you can't
[55:08] receive the Holy Ghost Satan telling you
[55:11] that you can't have the power of God
[55:13] that was only for the prophet or that
[55:14] was for another that is the Antichrist
[55:18] Spirit trying to seow amen seeds of of
[55:23] discouragement to you now watch he says
[55:27] he will be as thwarted definitely
[55:29] thwarted day as when Christ with stod
[55:31] his every effort to gain power over him
[55:33] in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation
[55:36] but we love it with true Revelation in
[55:38] our lives the Gates of Hell cannot
[55:40] Prevail against us and we will prevail
[55:43] against them let's let's go down and
[55:45] read one more
[55:46] paragraph he says you will recall that I
[55:49] mentioned at the beginning of this
[55:51] message that this book we are studying
[55:54] is the the actual revelation of Jesus
[55:56] himself in the church and his work in
[55:59] the future ages then I mentioned that it
[56:01] takes the Holy Spirit to give us
[56:03] Revelation or we will fail to get it
[56:07] bringing these two thoughts together you
[56:09] will see that it won't take just an
[56:11] ordinary study and thinking to make this
[56:15] book real it is going to take the
[56:17] operation of the Holy Ghost and that
[56:21] means this book can't be Reeve be
[56:23] revealed to anyone one but a special
[56:25] class of people it will take one with
[56:28] prophetic Insight it will require the
[56:31] ability to hear from God it will require
[56:34] Supernatural instruction not just a
[56:36] student comparing verse with verse
[56:38] though that is good but a mystery
[56:41] requires the teaching of the spirit or
[56:44] it never becomes clear how we need to
[56:48] hear from God and lay ourselves open and
[56:50] become yielded to the spirit and to hear
[56:53] and to know as I've already said let's
[56:56] see uh let's let's let's read one more
[56:59] here as I've already said this book
[57:02] Revelation is the consummation of of the
[57:05] Scriptures it is even placed exactly in
[57:07] in the right in the canning of
[57:09] scriptures at the end now you can know
[57:12] why it says that Anyone who reads or
[57:14] even hears it is blessed it is the
[57:17] revelation of God that will give you the
[57:19] authority over the devil and you can see
[57:23] why they who would ask
[57:25] or take from it would be cursed it would
[57:28] have to be so for who can add or take
[57:31] away from the perfect revelation of God
[57:34] and overcome the enemy it is that simple
[57:37] there is nothing of such prevailing
[57:39] power as the revelation of the word see
[57:42] in verse three a blessing is pronounced
[57:44] on those who give special attention to
[57:46] this book I think this refers to the Old
[57:49] Testament custom uh customs of the
[57:51] priest reading the word to encourage or
[57:53] to the congregation in the morning you
[57:55] see many could not read so the priest
[57:57] had to read to them as long as it was
[58:00] the word the blessing was there it
[58:02] didn't matter whether it was read or
[58:04] heard can you say Amen now so we so we
[58:09] can see here that that God's desire amen
[58:14] the whole purpose for this this book of
[58:18] Revelation is to show the church at the
[58:21] end time now remember it was done in
[58:24] symbols because it wasn't going to be
[58:26] known to them it was not Rapture season
[58:29] for them right amen but the this group
[58:33] of people a prophetic class of people
[58:36] Amen in other words the Rapture could
[58:39] only come to a people who could
[58:43] understand the Mysteries now I'm not
[58:45] saying that it's just a a teaching per
[58:48] se that we're as brother brandham would
[58:49] say Amen it's not that you you you're
[58:52] reading everything and you're getting it
[58:54] all down intellectually but you're
[58:57] understanding that there are there are
[58:59] there are powers that are fighting
[59:03] against your rapture there are powers
[59:07] that are fighting against you coming
[59:10] into that that that perfect completion
[59:13] fighting you from going back to Eden
[59:16] Satan does not want us going back to
[59:19] Eden brother we're at the end we're at
[59:23] the end this church is coming to its
[59:27] completion now brother brother brandham
[59:31] has has given us a couple of time and I
[59:32] I've wrote this down I I don't I I don't
[59:34] know if y'all can see that or not but
[59:36] but brother Bram gave us he he he gave
[59:39] us uh he's going to use this in the in
[59:41] the church ages a lot uh there's going
[59:44] to be four different things that he's
[59:46] going to be bringing out uh uh quite uh
[59:49] and he's going to talk about the two
[59:51] Vines he's going to talk about the wheat
[59:55] plant he's going to talk about the bride
[59:58] tree and then he's going to talk about
[1:00:01] the grafted branches and so he's he's
[1:00:04] going to come in and and you're so we
[1:00:07] when when he when when you hear him
[1:00:09] talking you you you you you've got to
[1:00:12] understand that he is using scriptural
[1:00:15] terms he's using these things these
[1:00:17] Parables that that Jesus had brought in
[1:00:20] amen uh uh the two Vines is is it comes
[1:00:23] from the two SE
[1:00:25] where the where where where Jesus said
[1:00:27] the word and that's that's in Matthew 13
[1:00:29] and 24 can y'all can y'all read these
[1:00:31] scriptures can y'all see that uh write
[1:00:33] those down because I I think it's I
[1:00:35] think it's good but Matthew 13 uh Jesus
[1:00:38] is saying that that the word has been
[1:00:41] sold and then the devil come in and and
[1:00:44] and and sold his seed and and then and
[1:00:48] and so then they he says well don't
[1:00:51] don't come in and and and try to pluck
[1:00:53] up the bad SE seed because when plucking
[1:00:56] up the bad stuff then you might end up
[1:00:58] pulling up the good stuff so he says let
[1:01:01] them grow together and as they grow
[1:01:04] together at Harvest time then you'll be
[1:01:08] able to tell which one's the good which
[1:01:10] one's the bad so so what what Jesus Is
[1:01:13] Telling amen and and we're going to find
[1:01:16] this out all through the CH the the
[1:01:18] church age book there are two Spirits
[1:01:21] God's got his seed now this is all
[1:01:23] happening in the church
[1:01:25] this is all taking place if if you read
[1:01:28] there in Matthew 13 this is all
[1:01:30] happening in the kingdom of God this is
[1:01:32] all taking place in the church this is
[1:01:34] not Sinner and Saint no this is the evil
[1:01:38] spirit of the Antichrist inside the
[1:01:41] church trying trying to do away with the
[1:01:45] power of the revelation of God's
[1:01:49] word y'all understanding that so so it's
[1:01:52] Satan and and and just remember remember
[1:01:55] that old devil that is that that fights
[1:01:57] you all the time and I again whether it
[1:01:59] be your healing whether it be your
[1:02:01] Perfection whether it be uh uh for your
[1:02:03] F that little gnawing demon that is
[1:02:07] constantly gnawing at your mind has been
[1:02:10] knowing at the church for all of these
[1:02:15] ages amen and and and the thing is we're
[1:02:20] going to find in the church ages that
[1:02:22] actually he he Satan won in in a lot of
[1:02:26] ways but then there but there is going
[1:02:28] to be a bride that is going to come
[1:02:30] forth so amen so in in this one here
[1:02:34] amen You So you you're going to see that
[1:02:37] that that there is two
[1:02:39] seeds amen here's the ground and there's
[1:02:42] two seeds
[1:02:44] planted and brother bram's going to deal
[1:02:46] with them as the two Vines and and
[1:02:49] they're going to grow together and
[1:02:52] they're going to be all connected
[1:02:53] together
[1:02:55] okay and they're going to be all in the
[1:02:57] framework of the church
[1:03:01] intertwined one's going to speak in
[1:03:03] tongues the other's going to speak in
[1:03:05] tongues the and it and it and it it it
[1:03:08] it looks the the religious brother Bram
[1:03:11] would talk about the this is all going
[1:03:12] to be in the church age book but he he
[1:03:14] talked about Abel and Cain how they were
[1:03:17] both worshippers so so you've got that
[1:03:20] now then you've got the wheat plant now
[1:03:22] we've been dealing with the wheat plant
[1:03:24] and we been going we we've been we've we
[1:03:26] we know that the the original Pentecost
[1:03:30] there there in in uh when it fell in ad
[1:03:33] uh 33 that original Pentecost was God's
[1:03:38] desire that's what God wanted amen
[1:03:42] that's the seed that's the original
[1:03:44] that's what God wanted to come and and
[1:03:47] we understand that as it came up to the
[1:03:49] age and as it and as it came into
[1:03:52] maturity then all of a sudden sudden
[1:03:54] amen it was it was it was hacked down
[1:03:57] and then it begin to come then it begin
[1:03:59] to come in into uh uh grow again and
[1:04:02] come in and we understand that we are in
[1:04:04] the very last of that of that season
[1:04:07] we've already went through this all
[1:04:09] right the bride tree brother brandham is
[1:04:12] going to deal with the bride tree and um
[1:04:15] how many's ever heard the uh brother
[1:04:16] brandham preach the restoration of the
[1:04:18] brid
[1:04:20] tree and he and he and he talks about
[1:04:22] how that uh that that in Psalms 1 and3
[1:04:26] am man there was this great tree and and
[1:04:29] his fruit never withered and he was by
[1:04:31] the tree of life and and and then Satan
[1:04:34] come in and and there was the four
[1:04:36] insects brother Bram says they were the
[1:04:39] messengers of death so this great tree
[1:04:43] that was that that was that was here and
[1:04:45] it was a mighty tree and and and then
[1:04:49] Satan came in through through four
[1:04:51] messengers of death it was the pommer
[1:04:53] worm the ol worm the canker worm and or
[1:04:57] the yeah the caterpillar the Locust I I
[1:05:00] messed up on one of those but anyways
[1:05:02] they they started eating away the tree
[1:05:04] of the leaves and then went down to the
[1:05:07] uh uh uh to the bark and then went you
[1:05:10] know just just took it all the way down
[1:05:12] to a nub and and it and it and actually
[1:05:15] the whole tree just just just become
[1:05:19] nothing amen all it was was just a
[1:05:22] little was just a little
[1:05:24] a little part there brother brandom
[1:05:26] saids but then through the restoration
[1:05:29] and and this right around here in this
[1:05:30] Sardis age this is where this is where
[1:05:34] the restoration begin to take place and
[1:05:36] this is what we're dealing with tonight
[1:05:37] I'm going to read some out of the Sardis
[1:05:39] uh age here so you know I'm just going
[1:05:41] to put this right here this is the time
[1:05:44] that restoration begin to go through all
[1:05:46] of these others are these are some of
[1:05:50] the Dark Ages and and you're going
[1:05:52] through so then the then then the slowly
[1:05:55] but surely restoration begins to come up
[1:05:59] and then with the restoration we
[1:06:01] understand how how how that now there's
[1:06:03] a great bride tree now there's this this
[1:06:05] other amen how many's heard brother
[1:06:07] brandom talk about the grafted
[1:06:09] branches and and it's a and it's a
[1:06:12] church you know and and uh it it God's
[1:06:16] blessed them and well the enemy had came
[1:06:19] in and taken out the branches you cut
[1:06:23] down and cut down a lot of the uh uh uh
[1:06:28] these these branches here
[1:06:31] amen and started grafting his own
[1:06:34] branches in
[1:06:36] it okay y'all remember brother bandam
[1:06:39] teaching on that okay so he's going to
[1:06:41] use the grafted branches how that these
[1:06:44] branches are bearing false witness to
[1:06:46] the tree amen now am I am I confusing
[1:06:50] y'all on on any of this yet amen he's
[1:06:52] going to be dealing with this in the
[1:06:54] church ages and showing you so what I'm
[1:06:56] trying to show you is they're all
[1:06:59] pointing to the same thing the spirit of
[1:07:02] the Antichrist trying to defile God's
[1:07:05] Church y'all got that amen this is God's
[1:07:09] tree this is God's bride tree amen and
[1:07:12] then they put then they come in and and
[1:07:14] and grafted Methodist branches and
[1:07:17] Baptist branches and and all of and
[1:07:19] they're living off the life of the tree
[1:07:22] and and and bearing false witness of it
[1:07:25] see but but in the last day what did God
[1:07:29] say I will
[1:07:31] restore I will restore brother bradam
[1:07:34] says and when this when this tree if it
[1:07:37] ever puts forth another if it if it ever
[1:07:40] puts forth another Branch now here it is
[1:07:43] it's just been cut off and it's been and
[1:07:45] it's got all of this other stuff growing
[1:07:47] he says but if it ever puts forth
[1:07:49] another branch on its own he says it
[1:07:53] will be be a Pentecostal Branch it'll be
[1:07:57] the one that went to the ground at the
[1:08:01] beginning can you say Amen so what are
[1:08:04] we looking for now I'm not talking about
[1:08:06] I'm not talking about ausa Street
[1:08:08] Pentecost that has that that has nothing
[1:08:10] to do with what God is bringing but
[1:08:12] God's got one desire and that is to take
[1:08:17] us back to to to a people that he can
[1:08:22] live in like he had in the book of
[1:08:25] Acts amen now I want us to I I want us
[1:08:28] just to read a little bit more here as
[1:08:30] we as we go amen and and uh matters of
[1:08:34] fact let let's let's just look here
[1:08:36] let's look here at the patmas

[1:09:02] um let's see let let me see if I can I
[1:09:05] don't know if I
[1:09:07] can okay so in the in the patmas vision
[1:09:10] it's going to be uh it's going to be
[1:09:12] under the golden
[1:09:14] lampstands but it's and it but it's
[1:09:16] going to be down to the
[1:09:20] um let's see from the that's going to be
[1:09:23] one
[1:09:24] two three four five it'll be at the
[1:09:28] sixth paragraph So if y'all wantan to
[1:09:31] follow me there with with those now
[1:09:34] brother brother Brandon would deal with
[1:09:36] this uh we're on 51 and in the middle
[1:09:39] we're going to start right in the middle
[1:09:41] of that of of that um uh paragraph there
[1:09:45] he's dealing with the
[1:09:46] lamps um well the first first one is lit
[1:09:51] and then it lights the others but I'm
[1:09:53] going to go right on
[1:09:54] down to where it starts with the
[1:09:55] original outpouring of Pentecost and on
[1:09:58] the page those of you that have this
[1:10:00] book right here there it is right in the
[1:10:02] middle of that of that paragraph right
[1:10:05] there all
[1:10:05] right it says the original outpouring
[1:10:08] and and I want you the reason I'm I want
[1:10:10] you to do this because I want you to
[1:10:11] Mark some of this down hey look see this
[1:10:14] is I'm I'm I'm a marker anyways so
[1:10:19] so anything that's good write it in the
[1:10:22] back of your book and then put the page
[1:10:24] number down on it and then because what
[1:10:26] you're going to find is brother
[1:10:27] Brandon's going to be dealing with like
[1:10:28] this like this part here on the on the
[1:10:30] Pentecostal on the Pentecostal Church
[1:10:33] brother Brandon's going to be dealing
[1:10:34] with it in every Church age and he's and
[1:10:38] he's because he's constantly going to be
[1:10:39] pointing what the end is going to be
[1:10:41] what the end is going to be what the end
[1:10:43] so what I do is I write down like I've
[1:10:45] got down here um uh the citrus tree okay
[1:10:50] with the with the grafted branches
[1:10:51] that's on page 51 I've got uh uh I've
[1:10:56] I've got the the the H the Holy Ghost
[1:10:58] ruling the church page 93 I've got all
[1:11:01] of these things all wrote down and and
[1:11:03] um and as you can see uh I I like
[1:11:07] marking my book up
[1:11:08] Hallelujah enjoy it while you're reading
[1:11:11] and and um all right let's go so the
[1:11:14] original outpouring of the Pentecost
[1:11:16] which outpouring came direct from Jesus
[1:11:18] on The Mercy Seat is doing is in doing
[1:11:22] his his Church through all the Seven
[1:11:25] Ages and showing forth perfectly that
[1:11:28] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:11:30] and forever the never changing God in
[1:11:33] his Essence and in his ways in first in
[1:11:36] John 15 Jesus says I am the vine you are
[1:11:39] the branches he is the main Vine that
[1:11:42] which comes out of the original root
[1:11:44] from the original seed that has the life
[1:11:47] in it now the vine does not bear
[1:11:50] fruit it is the branches that do that
[1:11:53] now now watch this you can take a citrus
[1:11:55] tree such as an orange tree and graft it
[1:11:59] into the grapefruit limb a Lim a and
[1:12:02] graft into it a grapefruit limb a lemon
[1:12:06] limb a tangelo Limb and all and other
[1:12:09] kinds of that uh variety and all those
[1:12:12] limbs will grow but those grafted limbs
[1:12:16] will not bear oranges no sir the lemon
[1:12:21] the lemon limb will bear lemons the
[1:12:24] grapefruit limb will bear grapefruits
[1:12:26] and so on yet those limbs will be
[1:12:30] thriving off the life in the tree but if
[1:12:33] that tree ever puts forth another branch
[1:12:35] of itself it will be an orange branch
[1:12:38] and be oranges why because the life in
[1:12:42] the limb and the life in the trunk are
[1:12:45] identical whereas it wasn't so with the
[1:12:48] grafted lims so grafted branches have
[1:12:51] their sources in other kinds of L life
[1:12:53] from other trees from other roots from
[1:12:56] other
[1:12:57] seeds oh they will bear fruit all right
[1:13:00] but they won't bear oranges they cannot
[1:13:04] because they are not the original now
[1:13:07] now how many understands
[1:13:09] that amen you kid always understand that
[1:13:12] now why now have yall ever know have
[1:13:14] y'all ever wondered have y'all ever
[1:13:16] wondered why there are so many who claim
[1:13:18] to be Christians
[1:13:19] today and they don't look nothing it
[1:13:22] doesn't quite look anything like
[1:13:26] this
[1:13:27] huh it shows that the roots are from
[1:13:30] something
[1:13:31] else and it took a prophet to come in
[1:13:33] and show us these things that wait just
[1:13:35] a minute that's what these Church agents
[1:13:37] are going to show that that inside the
[1:13:41] church there's going to be all kinds of
[1:13:43] junk now it's not a church like this
[1:13:46] it's the church age it's the it's the
[1:13:50] it's it's it's the full scope amen
[1:13:53] within we're in the leodys and church
[1:13:56] age and so what we are seeing we've got
[1:13:59] our little church here that we love and
[1:14:01] yet we we we go down the road and we we
[1:14:03] you you kids have friends that go to
[1:14:05] church you have a lot of them cry and
[1:14:09] and a lot of them sing a lot of them a
[1:14:11] lot of them go to altars a lot of them
[1:14:13] do lots of wonderful things but yet
[1:14:17] their lives don't line up with the
[1:14:20] Bible praise the Lord it's because they
[1:14:25] they love God they've got some of the
[1:14:27] life of God now this they might be
[1:14:29] Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal they
[1:14:33] they truly they they live off of the
[1:14:36] life CA do you you have can you find
[1:14:38] that one that's got the different uh
[1:14:40] graft the tree that's got everything
[1:14:41] grafted onto it so you you can have a
[1:14:44] citrus tree you can have an orange tree
[1:14:48] and this is true y'all can look it up on
[1:14:50] the internet how that now but you you
[1:14:52] you put in a lemon you can Graft in a
[1:14:55] lemon Branch see now I don't know that
[1:14:58] that's a citrus tree and look at it it's
[1:15:00] got oranges
[1:15:02] lemons
[1:15:04] grapefruit um it's it's I think that
[1:15:08] tree there is supposed to have like uh
[1:15:10] four or five different kinds of fruit on
[1:15:12] it now it they're living off of the of
[1:15:17] the life of the root but yet they are
[1:15:21] bearing fruit of some
[1:15:24] contrary and that's the reason why we've
[1:15:26] got one Jesus and we've got all these
[1:15:31] denominations that are that are so
[1:15:35] different see they're they're they're
[1:15:38] religious and they're living off that
[1:15:41] life but if they've not had a new birth
[1:15:45] if they didn't come from Christ if they
[1:15:47] didn't have a new birth and born of
[1:15:50] Christ then all they are is like that
[1:15:52] bre branch that is that is simply stuck
[1:15:55] into the into Christ and they love to go
[1:15:59] into church they they pay their TI but
[1:16:02] yet they're they they they ain't going
[1:16:04] to they ain't going to quit cutting
[1:16:06] their hair they ain't going to quit
[1:16:08] smoking their cigarettes or they ain't
[1:16:10] going to quit oh they don't believe in
[1:16:12] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:14] speaking in tongue oh no we don't what
[1:16:17] but but the Bible says well we don't
[1:16:18] care what the Bible says you see they're
[1:16:20] just they're connected to it living the
[1:16:23] life of it but their fruits are totally
[1:16:26] different right are y'all are y'all
[1:16:28] catching that so but that's not what God
[1:16:33] had in mind he's not wanting a bunch of
[1:16:36] people to claim to be Christians he's
[1:16:39] wanting a church he can live his life
[1:16:43] through the Roots can't bear fruit the
[1:16:46] vine can't bear fruit only the branches
[1:16:50] and God has got a church that he wants
[1:16:54] to live his life through all right let's
[1:16:57] continue on
[1:16:59] now okay so now we're in the very last
[1:17:01] paragraph it says that's the way the
[1:17:03] church is the vine has been split and
[1:17:06] limbs have been grafted they have they
[1:17:09] they have grafted in Baptist limbs
[1:17:11] Methodist limbs Presbyterian limbs
[1:17:13] Pentecostal Limbs and those limbs are
[1:17:15] bearing Baptist Methodist Pentecostal
[1:17:17] Presbyterian fruit in other words they
[1:17:19] don't answer to the Bible they answer to
[1:17:22] their denomination
[1:17:23] that's right their denominations telling
[1:17:25] them what they can preach and what they
[1:17:26] can't preach their denomination well
[1:17:29] praise the Lord but God's got his church
[1:17:32] that's going to answer to him and his
[1:17:34] word alone amen well that should make
[1:17:37] you want to
[1:17:38] shout now he says and those Lambs bear
[1:17:41] Baptist uh Methodist Pentecostal
[1:17:44] Presbyterian fruit denominational seeds
[1:17:47] from which they produce the fruit but if
[1:17:50] the vine ever brings forth a another
[1:17:53] branch of itself you know which way this
[1:17:55] is going so you might as well shout
[1:17:56] hallelujah hallelujah that Branch will
[1:17:59] be exactly like the vine itself it will
[1:18:03] be the same kind of a branch that was
[1:18:06] brought forth at Pentecost it will speak
[1:18:08] in tongues and prophesy and have power
[1:18:12] and signs of the resurrected Jesus
[1:18:15] Christ in it why because it is thriving
[1:18:19] on the natural uh it is thrive on the
[1:18:23] natural resources of the vine itself you
[1:18:25] see it wasn't grafted into the vine it
[1:18:28] was born in the vine when those other
[1:18:31] branches were grafted in all they could
[1:18:34] do was Bear their own fruit for they
[1:18:36] were not born of that vine they don't
[1:18:39] know about the original life and the
[1:18:41] original Fruit they cannot know it for
[1:18:45] they're not born uh for they were not
[1:18:47] born of it but if they had been born of
[1:18:50] it that same life that was in the
[1:18:52] original stem Jesus would be would have
[1:18:55] come through them and manifested through
[1:18:57] them St John 14 and 12 verily verily I
[1:19:01] say unto you he that believeth on me the
[1:19:03] works that I do shall he do also Greater
[1:19:05] Works than these shall he do because I
[1:19:07] go unto my father denominations which
[1:19:10] are men a man directed cannot be born of
[1:19:14] God for it is it is the spirit not man
[1:19:17] that gives life oh how how thrilling it
[1:19:20] is to think of those seven lamps drawing
[1:19:23] life and light from the resources of the
[1:19:25] main bow because they had their Wicks
[1:19:27] dipped therein each Church age messenger
[1:19:30] is depicted here his life is on fire
[1:19:33] with the Holy Ghost his Wick and life
[1:19:35] has been immersed with in Christ and
[1:19:37] through that Wick he is drawing the very
[1:19:40] Life of Christ and by it gives out the
[1:19:42] light of the church what kind of a light
[1:19:45] is he giving the very same light that
[1:19:48] was in the first lamp that was lit right
[1:19:51] on down Through the Ages down the ages
[1:19:53] to the present time of the last day
[1:19:55] messenger the same light the same life
[1:19:58] same light is manifested by a life that
[1:20:01] has been that is hid with Christ in God
[1:20:04] now not only uh not only can we speak
[1:20:07] thus of The Messengers but every True
[1:20:10] Believer is dramatically depicted here
[1:20:13] they are all drawing from the same
[1:20:16] Source they all have been dipped into
[1:20:18] the same bow they are dead to themselves
[1:20:21] and their lives are HID with Christ in
[1:20:23] God they are sealed in by the Holy Ghost
[1:20:27] Ephesians 4:30 and grieve not the holy
[1:20:30] spirit of God whereby ye are sealed
[1:20:32] until the day of redemption no man can
[1:20:35] pluck them out of his hand their lives
[1:20:37] cannot be tampered with the visible life
[1:20:39] is burning and Shining giving light and
[1:20:42] manifestations of the Holy Ghost the
[1:20:44] inner invisible life is hidden in God
[1:20:47] fed by the Lord's word Satan cannot
[1:20:50] touch them not even death can touch them
[1:20:52] for death has lost its sting the grave
[1:20:55] has lost its Victory thanks be unto God
[1:20:58] we have this victory in and through our
[1:21:01] Lord Jesus Christ and then he says amen
[1:21:04] and
[1:21:05] amen now this is what God is wanting us
[1:21:09] this is what God is looking to us to for
[1:21:13] can you say Amen now I want us to also
[1:21:16] look just real quickly let's go to the
[1:21:19] Ephesian Church Age and and Page 66
[1:21:26] amen and I want us to just do a a some
[1:21:30] key things here now so brother Bram says
[1:21:31] if the vent when the maturity comes and
[1:21:35] and I'm and and again I'm coming back
[1:21:37] over here when it comes to this the the
[1:21:41] maturing time of this leodys and age now
[1:21:45] I've got this Pentecost down here in
[1:21:47] black and the bride time back here in
[1:21:48] Black that that that is not nine ages
[1:21:51] that is that is there's only Seven Ages
[1:21:53] right only Seven Ages so this bride time
[1:21:56] is in the leoan age but God brother
[1:22:00] bradam Ed this all those terms to let
[1:22:03] you know that they're in this age leoan
[1:22:06] age if you look there it's it's just
[1:22:08] completely blacked out but there is a
[1:22:11] bride that is going to come out of that
[1:22:14] in this bride time she's going to be
[1:22:16] very few but she's going to be full of
[1:22:19] the Holy Ghost and the Very life of God
[1:22:22] can you say Amen now now so I I want you
[1:22:25] to look that's the reason I'm hitting
[1:22:26] some of these areas there's these are
[1:22:28] some specific things that brother Bram
[1:22:30] says now remember Satan don't want you
[1:22:32] have that Revelation that the power of
[1:22:35] God is in this church he wants you to
[1:22:37] think that it's a dogmatic teaching and
[1:22:40] that you just got to learn to be good
[1:22:41] sit down and and go to church pay your
[1:22:44] ti make make sure the preacher eats a
[1:22:46] steak you know uh uh once or twice a
[1:22:49] month or two and and and and and make
[1:22:51] sure everything's all going good right
[1:22:53] now that's not what God wants God wants
[1:22:57] a church that he can live in flow
[1:23:01] through manifest himself to can you say
[1:23:05] Amen now now and he says when if that if
[1:23:10] that church ever when that tree ever
[1:23:11] puts forth another one it's going to be
[1:23:13] a Pentecostal Branch now let's look here
[1:23:15] and and look at another thing that
[1:23:16] brother brandham would say and that's in
[1:23:18] this in the third chapter the Ephesian
[1:23:22] Church Age and and it's going to be at
[1:23:24] the very uh right there on that first
[1:23:27] page of that
[1:23:29] chapter down to
[1:23:31] the um the third paragraph the key given
[1:23:35] me of the Lord whereby I was able to
[1:23:37] determine the messengers for each age is
[1:23:40] the mo is a most scriptural one in fact
[1:23:43] it might be called the Keystone of the
[1:23:47] Bible now this is good now he's going to
[1:23:49] he's he's he's going to he's he's going
[1:23:51] to show show some something to us the
[1:23:54] Keystone of the Bible it is the
[1:23:57] Revelation that God never
[1:24:02] changes so as we go through this God
[1:24:06] never changes Church changes preachers
[1:24:09] can change God never
[1:24:11] changes your your ideas change God
[1:24:15] cannot change aren't you glad that God
[1:24:17] can't
[1:24:17] change amen now it says God never
[1:24:21] changes and that his ways are as
[1:24:24] unchangeable as he is in Hebrews 13:8 it
[1:24:28] says Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:24:31] today and forever Ecclesiastes
[1:24:34] 3:14 I know that whatsoever God doeth it
[1:24:38] shall be forever none can put to it nor
[1:24:41] anything taken from it and God doeth it
[1:24:44] that men should fear before him that
[1:24:47] which uh that which hath been as now and
[1:24:51] that which is to be hath already been
[1:24:53] and God requireth that which is which is
[1:24:55] passed here it is an unchangeable god
[1:24:59] with unchangeable ways unchanging ways
[1:25:02] what he did at the first he will have to
[1:25:05] keep on doing until it is done for the
[1:25:09] last time there will never be a change
[1:25:13] apply that to the church ages the kind
[1:25:16] of man that God chose for the first age
[1:25:19] and how God manifested in that man's
[1:25:21] Ministry would be the example for all
[1:25:24] other ages and God did it in the what
[1:25:28] God did in the first age is what he
[1:25:30] wants to do in all other ages now we
[1:25:34] know exactly from the word which was
[1:25:36] recorded by the Holy Spirit how the
[1:25:38] first or original church was founded how
[1:25:40] God manifested himself in her the word
[1:25:44] can't change or be changed because the
[1:25:47] word is God John 1:1 in the beginning
[1:25:51] was the word the word was with God the
[1:25:53] Word was God to change one word of it as
[1:25:56] as did Eve bring sin and death even as
[1:26:00] it says in Revelations 22 and 18 If any
[1:26:03] man shall add unto these things God
[1:26:07] shall add unto him the plagues that are
[1:26:09] written in this book and if any man
[1:26:12] shall take away from the words of the
[1:26:14] prophecy of the book of this prophecy
[1:26:16] God shall take away his part out of the
[1:26:19] book of life out of the holy city and
[1:26:22] the things that are written in this book
[1:26:24] thus what the church was at Pentecost is
[1:26:27] the standard that is the standard there
[1:26:29] is no other pattern there is no other
[1:26:32] pattern no matter what the scholars say
[1:26:35] God has not changed that pattern God uh
[1:26:39] what God did at Pentecost he has to keep
[1:26:41] on doing until the church ages close
[1:26:44] though Scholars may tell you the
[1:26:46] apostolic AG is over don't you believe
[1:26:48] it such a statement is wrong on two
[1:26:50] accounts first of all Paul it is wrong
[1:26:53] to suppose that there aren't any more
[1:26:55] Apostles just because uh uh the the 12
[1:26:59] original 12 are dead an apostle means a
[1:27:01] sent one and there are many sent ones
[1:27:03] today but they're called missionaries as
[1:27:06] long as men are being called and sent
[1:27:07] forth with the word of Life there is an
[1:27:09] Apostolic age going on secondly they
[1:27:12] refer to an age of the manifested holy
[1:27:15] ghost power as being over since the
[1:27:17] Bible has been completed that is untrue
[1:27:21] there is not even one scripture that
[1:27:23] suggests that uh but many conclusively
[1:27:26] state otherwise here is our proof of of
[1:27:29] these charges that these charges are
[1:27:31] false Acts 2 and 38 then Peter said unto
[1:27:34] them repent be baptized every one of you
[1:27:36] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:27:38] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:27:39] the gift of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:27:41] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:27:44] and to all that are a far off even as
[1:27:46] many as the Lord Our God shall call the
[1:27:48] promise of Power with the with which the
[1:27:51] apostles were ued at Pentecost is to you
[1:27:55] Jews to your children Jews and to all
[1:27:59] that are AAR off Gentiles to as many as
[1:28:02] the Lord Our God shall call both Jew and
[1:28:05] Gentile until he stops calling the
[1:28:09] Pentecostal message and power will not
[1:28:15] cease now what are we to expect in this
[1:28:18] last
[1:28:19] church now where do expect a God in the
[1:28:23] Supernatural
[1:28:24] Rim but we're finding out that Satan
[1:28:27] knew Satan knows what God has in
[1:28:31] store so Satan has counterfeited it he's
[1:28:35] counterfeited it with the false Vine
[1:28:40] he's counterfeited it and he's trying to
[1:28:43] come in and be now he speaking in
[1:28:46] tongues he's working miracles and the
[1:28:49] True Vine wants to say ha stay away stay
[1:28:53] away I'm going to stay brother you do
[1:28:55] you do away with the power of God you're
[1:28:57] not going to overcome
[1:29:00] that's so and that's that this is
[1:29:02] something that as you begin to read the
[1:29:04] church ages you're going to find oh
[1:29:06] brother brandom's going to hit those
[1:29:07] guys those those those guys in that
[1:29:10] false in that false Vine speaking in
[1:29:13] tongues and prophesying and yet not
[1:29:16] living the word but on the other hand
[1:29:19] he's going to rebuke and say if you
[1:29:22] don't have the life of Pentecost in your
[1:29:25] church then you're living under you're
[1:29:29] not you're you're not there where you
[1:29:30] need to
[1:29:31] be God is wanting this church to come
[1:29:36] into a glorious fellowship with him and
[1:29:40] brother this means that we can't just
[1:29:42] learn it we got to have a revelation of
[1:29:45] who we are what we are and brother the
[1:29:49] power of God's here to make it to liveen
[1:29:51] can you say Amen now all right so so uh
[1:29:58] now
[1:30:02] um so until he stops calling the
[1:30:04] Pentecostal message and power will not
[1:30:05] cease what the church had at Pentecost
[1:30:08] is her inalienable right originally she
[1:30:12] had the pure word she had the power of
[1:30:15] the spirit manifested in diverse signs
[1:30:17] wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost that
[1:30:20] Hebrews Hebrews 2 and one therefore we
[1:30:23] ought to give the more Earnest heed to
[1:30:25] the things which we have heard lest at
[1:30:27] any time we should let them slip for if
[1:30:30] the word spoken by Angels were steadfast
[1:30:33] and every transgression and Disobedience
[1:30:35] to the word received a just recompense
[1:30:37] of reward how shall we escape if we
[1:30:40] neglect so great salvation which at the
[1:30:44] first began to be spoken by the Lord and
[1:30:47] was confirmed unto us by them that heard
[1:30:49] him God all and God also bearing them
[1:30:52] witness both with signs and wonders
[1:30:54] diverse Miracles gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:30:57] according to his own will that original
[1:31:00] church was not organized by men it was
[1:31:03] led by the Holy Ghost it wasn't very big
[1:31:06] it was hated and dispised it was
[1:31:09] oppressed it was persecuted into death
[1:31:11] but it was true to God it stayed with
[1:31:15] the original word pattern can you say
[1:31:19] amen amen so he says don't be like
[1:31:21] astray here when I said that God and his
[1:31:24] ways never change I did not say that the
[1:31:28] church and its Messengers could change
[1:31:30] could not change the church isn't God so
[1:31:33] she can change but what I said was that
[1:31:36] because of the unchanging God with the
[1:31:39] unchanging ways now here we go we can go
[1:31:43] back to the
[1:31:45] beginning and see the first and perfect
[1:31:48] ACT of God and then judge by that
[1:31:51] standard
[1:31:52] that how that is how it is done the true
[1:31:55] church will always try to be like the
[1:31:58] original of Pentecost the true church
[1:32:00] today will try to approximate the early
[1:32:04] first one the messengers to the church
[1:32:06] having the same spirit of God in them
[1:32:09] will try to approximate the Apostle Paul
[1:32:12] they won't be exactly like him but the
[1:32:14] true Messengers will be the one that
[1:32:15] come the closest who will be free of all
[1:32:17] men sold out to God Gave forth the word
[1:32:20] of God only and manifested the power and
[1:32:23] the Holy Ghost in power none else would
[1:32:25] do you have to work from the be the
[1:32:28] original as like begets like the true
[1:32:31] church will always be the one that tries
[1:32:34] to follow in the steps of her Founders
[1:32:35] at Pentecost and her Messengers will
[1:32:37] follow the Apostle Paul the first
[1:32:39] Messenger to the first church age it is
[1:32:42] that simple and that wonderful amen can
[1:32:46] you say Amen to that now so so you can
[1:32:52] see what brother brand I'm now I'm going
[1:32:54] to I'm the time has already got away
[1:32:56] from me so we're going to close but I I
[1:32:58] want to I want to show you something in
[1:33:00] this sardian church now now we're the
[1:33:03] sardian church age is is this one that I
[1:33:06] put the blue in uh uh up here now this
[1:33:09] is the one that is starting to come that
[1:33:11] is starting to come forth and and and
[1:33:15] it's the
[1:33:16] reformation and so uh it doesn't look
[1:33:19] anything like the Pentecostal church and
[1:33:23] so brother bradam is putting a few
[1:33:25] things in there and I was going to read
[1:33:26] well I was going to read you 10 pages
[1:33:28] out of that but we're not going to do
[1:33:29] that amen but but I do I do want to read
[1:33:32] um uh page
[1:33:34] 250 uh and you can you can write these
[1:33:36] things down uh page 250 in the middle of
[1:33:39] the of the second
[1:33:41] paragraph um brother brother Bram was is
[1:33:44] is now he's now he's now we We've Come
[1:33:46] Through the Dark Ages and and um uh I
[1:33:50] have a reason for the way I'm doing this
[1:33:53] tonight because I'm trying I'm trying to
[1:33:56] put the end product of what God is
[1:33:58] looking for don't look at this as if I'm
[1:34:01] just reading history no brother brandom
[1:34:04] is trying to show you what you're
[1:34:06] supposed to be at the end what we're
[1:34:08] going to be at the end what he want what
[1:34:11] God's got in his mind y'all
[1:34:13] understanding so so it's a pent don't
[1:34:16] don't read this a as just a mere student
[1:34:19] but Lord I want to be able to see all of
[1:34:23] the works of the Antichrist and what he
[1:34:26] has done to try to make that church
[1:34:29] lukewarm and
[1:34:31] Powerless I want to get rid of that so
[1:34:34] that I can believe God for the
[1:34:36] supernatural in my life and everyone
[1:34:38] else's
[1:34:40] life I'm telling you this this message
[1:34:43] this message is a message of divine
[1:34:48] Glory Hallelujah the the the the 19 1906
[1:34:52] don't they didn't even have a they don't
[1:34:54] have a candle of what took and that was
[1:34:57] glorious that was a work of God brother
[1:34:59] randam said it was a work of Grace it
[1:35:00] was the third stage of of
[1:35:02] restoration but he says and it looked a
[1:35:04] lot like it but he says no that that had
[1:35:08] a lot of man in it he says what this is
[1:35:10] that we're going to is something more
[1:35:13] glorious it's a matured bride she's been
[1:35:16] given a matured word she knows who she
[1:35:19] is can you say say
[1:35:23] Amen all right page 250 the middle of
[1:35:27] the
[1:35:28] second uh page or yeah the second
[1:35:31] paragraph amen it says again the
[1:35:33] scripture says that God anointed Jesus
[1:35:36] of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and
[1:35:38] power and he went about doing good
[1:35:39] healing all that were oppressed of the
[1:35:40] devil as Jesus went away he told his
[1:35:43] disciples to T at Pentecost at which
[1:35:46] time the very same spirit that was upon
[1:35:48] him would come back and fall upon them
[1:35:51] and fill them then that called out body
[1:35:54] the church would be in his stad upon the
[1:35:56] Earth taking his place and because that
[1:35:59] same spirit that was in him would be in
[1:36:03] them they would do the very same works
[1:36:06] and any people that is truly the body of
[1:36:09] Jesus Christ the true church WIll
[1:36:11] manifest the same work as Jesus did in
[1:36:14] the Pentecost and the Pentecostal church
[1:36:16] because the same spirit will be in them
[1:36:19] any other church that does not have that
[1:36:22] Spirit and the manifestations is going
[1:36:25] to have to account unto God now that's
[1:36:29] that's quite a that's quite a judgment
[1:36:31] call talking to our age here because
[1:36:34] we're we're not we're not in that that
[1:36:36] that fifth or that sixth or even at the
[1:36:38] beginning of that seventh we're we're at
[1:36:41] the ending let's go to the next page
[1:36:43] let's go to the next page there and uh
[1:36:45] we go one it's in it's in the that that
[1:36:48] second paragraph that's starting of it
[1:36:51] he says
[1:36:53] yes uh and there you know I'm just I'm
[1:36:55] I'm just highlighting this to wet your
[1:36:57] whistle yes the spirit is not seven
[1:37:00] spirits but one he will always be the
[1:37:03] same and act the same the seven
[1:37:04] Messengers will have the same spirit and
[1:37:06] teach the same word and have the same
[1:37:07] power and if the church is the true
[1:37:10] church it will have the very same spirit
[1:37:13] and word and acts of power that they had
[1:37:16] at Pentecost by experience it will be an
[1:37:20] A A Pentecost Church there will be
[1:37:23] tongues
[1:37:24] interpretation prophecy healings God
[1:37:28] will be in the midst of her God will
[1:37:31] declare himself in the midst of her as
[1:37:33] he always has Hallelujah she will be
[1:37:37] unorganized don't forget that can you
[1:37:40] say Amen so so as he's as he's telling
[1:37:44] as he's going and bringing brother
[1:37:46] brandom uh in this start as Church age
[1:37:49] now they had already come out and and uh
[1:37:52] came out of the Catholic church and it
[1:37:53] wasn't uh uh Martin Luther there in the
[1:37:57] 1500s Martin Luther had came in and he
[1:38:00] and he put the 95 thesis and and and and
[1:38:03] he started the Reformation swept the

[1:38:34] have not found thy works perfect before
[1:38:36] God
[1:38:37] remember what thou has received and
[1:38:40] heard and hold fast and repent now the
[1:38:44] message had
[1:38:46] came but already it wasn't too very long
[1:38:49] and they had already built denominations
[1:38:52] and set up set up men to run their their
[1:38:55] church I Martin Luther had barely
[1:38:59] died had barely died and they were
[1:39:02] already organizing and before you know
[1:39:06] it we had all of these uh uh we had z uh
[1:39:10] swindley we had we had uh Knox and
[1:39:13] Calvin we had all of these other guys
[1:39:15] and they were all sitting up and and and
[1:39:17] brother brandham is is is is telling
[1:39:20] them he says now he's he gives the he
[1:39:22] gives the interpretation I Know Thy
[1:39:24] Works what were these works that came
[1:39:27] before the Lord and caused his
[1:39:29] displeasure well you know that each age
[1:39:31] lapped over into the next age we have a
[1:39:33] continuation of the works of the fourth
[1:39:35] age into the fifth these works are as as
[1:39:39] you are are well aware uh were number
[1:39:43] one he has number one written down the
[1:39:46] leadership of the Holy Ghost was
[1:39:47] superseded by human hierarchy number two
[1:39:50] the the pure word of God and its free
[1:39:52] benefit to all men was deposed for
[1:39:55] Creeds dogmas Church orders and ETC
[1:39:57] number three the worship in the spirit
[1:40:00] and the gifts of the Spirit and all
[1:40:02] which pertains to the true Community
[1:40:04] Fellowship of the Saints was cast aside
[1:40:06] for litery Idol uh uh and literal idol
[1:40:10] worship Pagan feasts ETC number four
[1:40:12] Mary alery was assuming a greater place
[1:40:16] in the Christian worship until she had
[1:40:19] actually assumed a place of the godhead
[1:40:21] and the son was was brought forth
[1:40:23] brought from his lofty position uh of of
[1:40:27] overall to being s uh subservient to a
[1:40:30] man called the pope who termed himself
[1:40:32] the viker of Christ and and and then and
[1:40:36] then he goes he goes on down you know
[1:40:39] talking about how that they started they
[1:40:40] started literally
[1:40:42] persecuting uh the people that did not
[1:40:44] agree with them so so what what I what
[1:40:48] what Satan what what Satan has tried to
[1:40:50] do do all through these ages he wanted
[1:40:53] to kill the church and then every time
[1:40:57] as the leaf began to grow as the power
[1:40:59] of God begin to come
[1:41:03] up came through Wesley or or through
[1:41:06] Luther through through the through the
[1:41:07] the leaves well they wanted to stay
[1:41:10] there but the life Gods got a
[1:41:14] Pentecostal Church he's not wanting a
[1:41:18] place for us to just stop go to church
[1:41:21] and worship he's wanting a living
[1:41:23] Pentecostal Church y'all understand that
[1:41:27] when Luther refused when Luther's group
[1:41:30] refused to keep on growing with the
[1:41:33] plant what happened they organized they
[1:41:37] died they the life of God left that
[1:41:40] church and they begin to persecute
[1:41:42] anybody that didn't agree with them life
[1:41:44] of God was gone but the life kept going
[1:41:46] on and finally here come Wesley and then
[1:41:48] here come see you see what I'm saying we
[1:41:51] don't want to put my my thoughts here
[1:41:54] tonight is do not you're going to see in
[1:41:56] the church age book don't put a period
[1:42:00] on your experience with God Amen don't
[1:42:04] put a period we have got a church this
[1:42:08] church age is going is ending with an
[1:42:11] eternal Church age this people is this
[1:42:15] group is is not going the way of the
[1:42:18] grave in another church age this group
[1:42:21] is catching a
[1:42:23] Rapture that means there's a people
[1:42:26] who's going to believe God I believe
[1:42:28] you're that people I I I believe this
[1:42:30] message has found you amen and
[1:42:33] predestinated you and the life of God is
[1:42:36] in this
[1:42:38] message Amen in this message to make to
[1:42:42] to to to live his life in
[1:42:45] you now the
[1:42:47] Pentecostals now what are they trying to
[1:42:49] do now they had the life of God in 1906
[1:42:52] that was true you go back and read the
[1:42:53] the history of my 1906 and it was a
[1:42:55] powerful powerful powerful thing that
[1:42:58] God was doing in 1906 amen but within
[1:43:01] three years they were all by
[1:43:03] 1909 they had already organized they and
[1:43:06] the and the power of God had already
[1:43:08] shut down when brother brandham came on
[1:43:10] the scene in the 30s there wasn't even
[1:43:13] there was not even a
[1:43:15] a a talking about the the healing
[1:43:19] anymore there was not talking about
[1:43:21] miracles anymore here they lived under
[1:43:24] the power of the Holy Ghost in the early
[1:43:27] 1900s and by the time that brother
[1:43:28] brandham came on and the angel visited
[1:43:32] him it was it was it was unheard of the
[1:43:36] Pentecostal organizations were
[1:43:38] many they they had so many Pentecostal
[1:43:42] organizations but it all died off now
[1:43:45] the organizations were still going yeah
[1:43:48] but they had went to music yeah they had
[1:43:51] went to trying to make it up they were
[1:43:54] trying they were trying to they had lost
[1:43:57] the power of God so now they're trying
[1:44:00] to work it up with fleshly
[1:44:02] manifestations God don't want fleshly
[1:44:05] manifestations God wants the
[1:44:06] supernatural living among the
[1:44:11] people you don't have to work this up
[1:44:13] just believe what you got
[1:44:16] am the life is in his word and when we
[1:44:20] accept that and believe every word
[1:44:23] hallelujah brother brand he says that's
[1:44:25] a Pentecostal Church coming then believe
[1:44:28] that don't put it aside that's what he
[1:44:31] is coming for I I and I missed my other
[1:44:33] quote but I I don't brother brother
[1:44:36] bradam says that is God's goal that's
[1:44:40] what he said it's his the Pentecostal
[1:44:43] church is God's
[1:44:47] goal don't fight it say Lord here here I
[1:44:51] am anoint me like you did them here live
[1:44:55] your I don't want to just learn it I
[1:44:58] don't want to just have moral cold I
[1:45:01] want the very life of the Holy Spirit
[1:45:04] living in
[1:45:05] me can you say amen that's what we want
[1:45:10] and here at the church we're not we're
[1:45:11] not we're we're we're not we're not
[1:45:13] making nothing up but I am as a minister
[1:45:17] I am wanting to see such an
[1:45:21] expectation in every one of us in this
[1:45:24] church such an expectation for God to
[1:45:26] fulfill his word such an expectation for
[1:45:30] another Pentecost such an expectation
[1:45:32] you say well brother wend that's that
[1:45:35] you're trying to take us back to 1906
[1:45:37] I'm skip
[1:45:39] 1906 I'm talking about what God what
[1:45:41] brother brandham said his goal is a
[1:45:45] Pentecostal
[1:45:47] church and it won't have none of that
[1:45:49] fleshly stuff in it it it'll have the
[1:45:51] power of the Holy Ghost come on but you
[1:45:55] got to believe what the prophet said you
[1:45:57] got to believe
[1:45:59] it you're the church this is the
[1:46:02] adoption message this is the finality
[1:46:05] you're here brother there ain't nothing
[1:46:08] else to come you got
[1:46:12] it start believing what he says about
[1:46:18] you yes amen
[1:46:22] well glory to God if the musicians would
[1:46:24] come amen amen amen all right so so did
[1:46:29] I help any tonight are y'all did y'all
[1:46:31] understand where I'm at there the spirit
[1:46:34] of the Antichrist and brother Brandon's
[1:46:36] going to be dealing with him in in those
[1:46:38] four different ways he's going to be
[1:46:40] dealing with all through that church
[1:46:41] ages and he's going to be showing you
[1:46:43] how it's the spirit of the enemy trying
[1:46:46] to take away the expectation for God to
[1:46:50] fulfill his word amen well God don't God
[1:46:53] don't do that anymore well we don't
[1:46:54] believe that anymore well well you know
[1:46:56] it don't matter anymore no if God says
[1:46:58] it I'm expecting God to still believe
[1:47:02] it amen Holiness is right because God
[1:47:06] said so amen the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:10] is right because God said
[1:47:13] so amen
[1:47:16] now I I would um uh I
[1:47:21] I I would I would like for us to just
[1:47:23] now start in those uh we
[1:47:26] we I I would i' encourage you to start
[1:47:29] at the very beginning but I uh uh you
[1:47:30] know with the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:47:33] and the patmas vision and uh we we
[1:47:36] covered a lot of that in um in in when
[1:47:40] we were talking about the lampstands and
[1:47:41] things like that but brother brandham
[1:47:43] has got on the godhead and things is
[1:47:46] just so powerful so I'd encourage you to
[1:47:49] start right there with the Book of
[1:47:49] Revelation or the revelation of Jesus
[1:47:51] Christ but I'd like for us um and and
[1:47:55] just start reading those things and then
[1:47:57] um and then we're going to we're going
[1:47:59] to try to start getting into the
[1:48:00] Ephesian Church age and just take start
[1:48:03] taking some nuggets out of those things
[1:48:05] now
[1:48:08] remember we're not at the we're not at
[1:48:10] the at the leaf stage here amen we're
[1:48:14] thankful for what God done uh through
[1:48:17] through Luther and Wesley and the
[1:48:19] Pentecostal
[1:48:21] but I'm wanting us to remember the goal
[1:48:24] the goal God has a goal God has a goal
[1:48:26] that goal
[1:48:28] is a bride to know who she is what is
[1:48:33] this book
[1:48:34] here you say well this was given before
[1:48:36] the Seven Seals well you know he
[1:48:38] preached the seven Church ages in 60
[1:48:41] that is
[1:48:42] true but the book did not come out until
[1:48:47] 65 and he has a lot more in this than
[1:48:50] what he had in the church
[1:48:52] ages and he and he he he went through
[1:48:55] with brother Lee Vil telling him to put
[1:48:58] this in and put that in brother lale was
[1:49:00] the one that was pinning it but brother
[1:49:02] brandham was the one that wrote it and
[1:49:04] when brother brandham in
[1:49:06] 1965 um I believe it's the
[1:49:11] Rapture and he talks about how many
[1:49:13] books he has he says I the only book I
[1:49:15] or he says the book I wrote I wrote the
[1:49:19] the the seven Church ages so some people
[1:49:22] say brother brandham didn't write it
[1:49:23] that someone else wrote it but brother
[1:49:24] brandham wrote this book under the
[1:49:26] inspiration and under the light of the
[1:49:29] open
[1:49:30] book under the light of the opening of
[1:49:34] the word the Seven
[1:49:35] Seals are y'all y'all I'm telling you
[1:49:39] right
[1:49:40] now that those seals and these Church
[1:49:43] ages are just man Satan hates them Satan
[1:49:45] hates the church age book and Satan
[1:49:47] hates the Seven
[1:49:49] Seals Satan hates any message after 1963
[1:49:54] but I'm glad that we've got it all right
[1:49:56] right right here I I I I
[1:50:00] do amen I I I believe that open book and
[1:50:04] there's just so many wonderful wonderful
[1:50:05] things and so I'd encourage you to to um
[1:50:10] to really take this seriously how many's
