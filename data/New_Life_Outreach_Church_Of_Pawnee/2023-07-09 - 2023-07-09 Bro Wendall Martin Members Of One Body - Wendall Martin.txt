shattered sometimes it's hard to understand but things like chance and Circumstance they don't really matter a father holds tomorrow in his hands and when others see a Shepherd boy God may see a king even though your life seems filled with ordinary things in just a moment he can touch you and Everything Will Change when others see a Shepherd boy God may see a king well he wasn't the oldest he wasn't the strongest chosen on that day yet the Giants fell and Nations trembled when they stood in his way and when others see a Shepherd boy God may see a king even though your life seems filled with ordinary things in just a moment he can touch him and everything will change when others see a Shepherd boy God God may see a king and when others sing a Shepherd boy God may see a king even know your life seems filled with ordinary things in just a moment he can touch you and everything will change when others see a Shepherd boy God may see a king me [Applause] can we stand and sing this is

Pawnee America a man with all of you Believers and trust everyone had a good good day today he manned good good lunch and and we want to say happy birthday to brother Steve I forgot it was your birthday this morning ah and uh but I sure love brother Steve you know he's a man of few words now now you'll see you'll see sister Karen off somewhere talking you know with some friends or whatever but brother Steve is you know he can be a loner he's just he's usually this just they're listening and um but I love brother Steve how many appreciates brother Steve Cochran love him a lot amen and uh so uh we sure we sure hope you had a good birthday today yeah there and um man I'll tell you what we've had a lot of birthdays this this last little bit haven't we and uh but that's good amen at least it's not just one of us getting old we're all getting old together amen praise the lord well let's let's look here in in in um Ephesians the um the fifth chapter and um we will start amen how about the 22nd verse my intentions are not to hold you long tonight um just want to give you a these these Sunday nights just give you a little extra uh something to fight the Devil with the rest of the week and um amen we we're all as I was saying this morning we're all fighting devils and um I'm I'm um I'm glad to have Warriors such as yourselves that we're fighting with they're in in Ephesians 5 and 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it cleanse it with the washing of the word water of the word and that he might present it to himself a glorious church not a defeated Church a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such blemish but that it should be holy uh or any such thing that it should be holy without blemish so are men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loves himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this call shall a man leave his father and mother shall be joined unto his wife the two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church so so he's brought this all that for husband and wives but he's wanting to get us to the mystery he's using the natural to portray the spiritual this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church let's go to the Lord in prayer father we want to thank you for your love and for Brotherhood for Fellowship and we're just asking Lord that you would you administer to us as we as we set now waiting upon you to speak and just ask Lord that you're anointing would be with every man and woman every boy and girl Lord I just pray that you'll just let us all come into that anointing with you we love you Lord we just ask that you would have your way in Jesus name we pray can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated there in John the 17th chapter amen he's he's talking about Iman um the father sent me into the world even so I sent them into the world for their sakes I sanctify myself and as he's praying to the father he says may they be one as thou father or thou father art in me and I in you that they also may be one in US so now Jesus is talking about the the the Oneness of the father in him it was God creating a body God living inside that body amen it was the fullness of the godhead but then God or Christ is asking that we become part of that godhead he is asking that we that they would be one in US so as I have paid the price of redemption amen this what my body is for now the redeemed may they be one in the father as I the Redeemer am in you now he and he and he wants to make it clear that it's not just for the disciples he says I I don't pray just for for these here alone but for them also that Shall Believe on me through their word and I believe that's talking to you and to me here tonight amen that's what it's for that they all may be one as thou father art in me I am thee they also may be one in us that the world may be May believe amen so then he says again I am them thou and me that they may be perfect in one now this Oneness is again is is not necessarily A man uh uh the the Oneness as uh Nimrod worship where we all uh uh it's a forced worship where we're all thinking the same we're all uh uh looking the same acting the same you know uh we but we are a man but we are one in his bone bone of his bone Spirit of his spirit amen can you say man so it's not important that we must see it all the same way amen it doesn't it's not that we have to have you have to have my Revelation or my Revelation but we need his Revelation and that's what we want amen and and that that he says a body thou has prepared for me now amen it's a living organism amen it's many members one body amen all shapes in all sizes all colors amen different likes different tastes different preferences but one body aren't you glad for that I'm glad that God's even got a five-fold Ministry amen now and not everyone uh happened to preach like an evangelist and not everyone having to to to to be a prophet not everyone having to be a pastor but it's it's it's a it's a United gifts we've got nine spiritual gifts that have been that that have been placed in the body by the Holy Ghost amen many different gifts but now we don't all speak in tongues we don't all prophesy we don't all see Visions we don't all see but we are one with him and we've got our position gathered under one promise one purpose and that is redemption and there is a United desire in every one of us amen and that great desire is to please him and our desire is amen thy will be done on Earth the inner earth as it is in heaven well praise the name of the Lord amen now that's that's the kind of love that God has given us amen that's the desire I I I I I don't I think that we we should I don't think love um love should not be something that um it has got drudgery to it I don't I don't think love should have something should be something that has fear in it now I I don't think my my wife should be fearful of of of me um going to divorce her I don't think that amen if I love my wife I'm going to be true to my wife she's going to be true to me amen and there is there there's going to be a lot of things that she does that I I don't care for there's going to be maybe some things I do that she doesn't care for amen just a few and and then there's then there's going to be plenty of of those things around but love goes beyond all of the uh all of the things that we don't see eye to eye on because I love her and she loves me now if you don't love your girl whatever you uh boys get a you know you get get you a girl amen if you don't love her in that way if that girl has to be manipulated around to to uh to to to the way that that you know that you think things should be all the time man then it's probably not genuine love it's not genuine love love has ha there is there is a bond that I love her for who she is she loves me for and she's got the proper love for me she'll want to be that way I want to please her she wants to please me praise the Lord I I just you know uh uh uh you know some of the circles around his amen you know if you ain't kicking on your wife and beating the door down and or kicking Furniture across the room amen then you're not being a good husband well I'm I'm here to tell you amen if you want to be a good husband you've got to have love towards your wife and and if you want to be a good wife amen you've got to love your husband and if we would appreciate the man he is and bring those qualities out in him he would in turn love you and bring those qualities out in you and it's a great big love affair how much more should it be with you and God 's opportunities to leave you as a Greek spot that God is trying to find ways to you to hell he's looking for a way to punish you Hallelujah I don't say it that way I see God as loving his family I see God as loving his bride with unconditional love and I see a bride that loves her Lord more than anything else in the world such a love affair such such a such a Divine love for this one who has who has called me to be his bride well he's not beating me over the head and telling me well you'd better do it the way that I want to do it amen how many how many believes that you know if you're coming to church and the preacher's having to beat you up and God's words happen to beat you up and these things it could be that your love is not right with God Hallelujah because I guarantee you amen when you love when you love God it's your desire to please him it's your desire to serve him it's your desire to give of yourself to him and you want his glory upon you I I think that's the greatest thing I I you know I I I I believe that God has this in this day that we're living in amen God is Not uh uh we're not a denominational uh uh you know denominational girl but we're a girl that God has pulled us out of the amen of the church system so that he can show his glory to us I believe God sent us a prophet God gave us an open book God done these things so that you would know your position in the kingdom of God I believe the wedding the marriage or the the wedding has taken place with that word that has come and you say I accept I believe the bride is being impregnated with that word in this hour that we're living in in fact we're not just bride but we're his wife amen this is the wife of the Lamb that I am preaching here today can you say amen and as they re in return our love toward him is Lord your desire is my desire if you know that he likes apple pie hey man you're not gonna you're you you're not going to be cooking him blackberry pie you're going to be cooking him apple pie amen if you know that he lacks the you know that that he wants supper done you know at five o'clock when he's when he gets off of work you're not gonna you're not gonna be doing cooking the supper at eight o'clock at night because your desire is to play he's your husband you say now you just went from love to Works no there's always works involved but it comes because of love I'm not I'm not being faithful to my wife because I the man because it's it's required of me to do I'm faithful to my wife because I love a girl well praise the Lord if you're not faith if you're if you're faithful to your wife because well it's the right thing to do that will only hold for so long that will only take place for someone but you've got to stand there with with that love and that's how the two of you become one you become one praise the Lord what can you say Amen so Neiman the common statement of the church world today well I'm just who I am and you'll have to accept me like I am that's not a married woman that's not the Bride of Jesus Christ that is not the Bride of the Bible she is saying not my will but thy will be done she loves him I believe that the Brian should be moving to our destiny amen that destiny that God has called us to I believe that God has given us his word and the mental at the right mental attitude towards any of God's Divine promises will come to pass we'll bring it to pass in our lives amen I believe that brother Branham says now amen just for a little text if I should call it that he says I want to speak for a moment on on two a moment or two on the word of expectation we always get what we expect when people expect anything well then they usually get what you're looking for amen it's the mental attitude that you have remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any promise of God it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal sick any person in here has the right to meet Satan anywhere if you're a Christian and you can defeat him on any grounds that he that he could stand on can you say Amen so so now here we go we are we are not apart from Christ but we are one with Christ Hallelujah you know imagine when we were first married there was a lot of uh tug and pool amen between my wife and I and you know finding out who was who and what was what and who was boss and who was not and and uh amen that rhymed praise the Lord and and who you know what we had to go and and things of that nature but the more that I've the more that I've you know decided I don't really have to tell her every day that I'm the boss and and and that she doesn't really have to uh let me know that um Iman um that I could be a better boss and and and once we got past all of that and began to to love one another the way that God has man at amount there's no questioning between us there is a love what I have is for her what I have is for her you know if if we could if we could understand that here today that God is not here in a he's not here in a body the body of Jesus Christ amen walking the Earth Jesus came to represent that Eternal Kingdom and that invisible God but he came to let us know that everything that God has he wants you to have it everything that God has he wants you to take it when when when you when my wife got married she took on my name I saved her from that name of butter and gave her Martin just has a ring to it amen now when I when when when when she married me I am now responsible for her she's no longer a butter she's no longer a man doing her own thing she is under my headship she is under my responsibility I am now responsible to provide for my gal I am to provide for her financially I am to provide for her emotionally I am to provide for her spiritually I am the head guy amen and it is my it is my honor it is my joy it is it is it is it is my privilege to provide for my girl but if my girl Hallelujah is constantly questioning me and and saying well I don't know if you're a good provider or not I don't know if you can do this or not I don't know what kind of a relationship would that be come on motion ship between the bride and Christ if she's constantly questioning God's ability to do what he said he would do well I'm preaching here tonight you're just trying to figure out what I'm going to preach on Amen but I'm pretty well laying the foundation right here hallelujah hallelujah if you're constantly questioning if God is able or if God is willing that must become quite a that must just really start ticking him off Hallelujah when you question him and comparing him with your natural things and comparing him with this and comparing him with that you're not to compare your husband with no other man you're gonna believe your husband for who he is Hallelujah and I you know this this kind of thing here that you know well you know this one here is a nicer car and this one here what I'm going to tell you when you married that guy he promised not to he didn't promise to give you you know to keep up with the Joneses and the Roy's Royce and all these kinds of things amen he promised to provide for you and it takes a good woman to just sit there and say I love my man I'm content with my man I'm thankful for my man what glory to God now now now your man might might Hallelujah I've I've preached in the past about Mr visionaire and there's there's uh there's then there's Mr uh uh uh there's Mr command and then there's Mr steady amen there's there's our three mysteries we got we got Mr command and he's the he's he's just the boss he's loud he's demanding he's amen you're going to do it my way and no one in the world has to know where he stands he stands where he stands brother Merle and so amen and so then there's and then there's Mr Visionary Mr Visionary he's he's he's the one that's sort of got his head in the in the clouds amen and and and he's he he's he's like a he's like a prophet in a way he he sees things afar off now they don't always come to pass amen but he sees things afar off and uh Hey man he's he's he's he's he's dreaming he sees things he amen and and and because of that that woman that is with Mr Visionary amen she's going to have quite a ride amen now the woman with Mr command now she's she had she had better learn how to say yes sir amen and miss and and Mr Visionary he's his chances are he's going to have this job for about 10 months and he's going to be over here and then he's going to be here and amen he's he's got dreams he's amen he lives a little bit with his head in the sky a little bit in the clouds amen but that's the way God made him and then there's Mr steady Hallelujah you know everyone in the church knows when he's going to get up you know exactly everyone knows when to call because he's drinking his coffee the same place at the same time for the last 110 years amen everything is the same he's it's going to be it's just it's just Mr steady there amen he's got a routine he wants to keep the routine Hallelujah and and and but God made all of these he'll keep the same job forever he's not worried about making a lot of money he just wants to take care of his family now there's nothing wrong with neither one of them but but but but if you're wanting a Mr steady you don't get mixed up with a Mr visionary you've got to love the ones that God gave you is that right yeah that's right now the when it's all said and done Hallelujah the guy the Mr steady will probably end up with the with all the money in the bank amen hallelujah there's this guy that was uh that came to our church when we first started and um it was it was it was something because other guys were making money and he just worked out here for the for the turnpike and he was making 10 bucks an hour and and everyone who kept telling him you can make more than that you need to you need to get you another job and he'd he'd sat there and just grin and say well you know and uh no you know when he drove this old ugly car they lived in an old ugly house they they they I I felt bad for him Hallelujah and um but I I met him here a while back and and he was you see I was uh I'd say I was 20 back in those days 25 and um he was about 10 years older than me and so uh um I think he retired when he was about 55. and I said really you're retiring and he said yeah I just bought a ranch and I said you you did you just you you just you just bought a ranch yeah I just bought a ranch I said really he said yeah I had the money saved back I've I've had it there so now I've got cattle and I see now you see you see what I'm saying so they're they're you yeah and then this is for you you you young guys too you don't have to have to be be making the the big big bucks all you have to do is learn how to save money and put it in the put it in the bank and then and and then you'll be you'll you'll be taken care of now so so but the bride is not compare Your Man with another man you can't compare them say well I ain't got it like this well I ain't got nothing like that no you've got your man and you've got to be thankful for what God's blessed you I promise you most it's most probable that you wouldn't get along with the other two the two kinds of characters you were attracted to that kind of a man for a reason now when we come to Christ you didn't know this is going to turn into a marriage seminar Hallelujah when we've come to Christ we should X them for who he is not flashy Christ is not flashy he's not out there trying with glitter and trying to impress people that's not Christ but Christ has got a love and a stability that if you'll put your confidence in him he'll bring you through every time his words he is Mr command he is one of those guys listen I've given you my word and I'm expecting you to believe me I'm giving you my word I don't want to say it twice so three times or four times just believe what I say praise the Lord amen now our attitude toward Christ and his word it should be of most utmost important you remember you remember Sarah amen and what gave Sarah faith is when she recognized her position when she recognized until that time it was always somebody else Sarah was always saying well it's got to be that one well it's got to be this it can't be me and and God was trying to say listen I'm given the promise to Abraham and to Sarah is that right matter of fact when the angel come he remember brother Branham says well he says I see the angel take his chair maybe and and leans back and you know his back toward the tent and Sarah listening through the tent you know and kind of ear dropping you know and listening through the tent and she was kind of in a awful mood that morning you don't see things when you come to church in that kind of a mood you just there's just no need of trying it you you just might as well have stayed home you won't get nothing out of it anyhow go home when you know when you when you come to church come prayed up come in the atmosphere come expecting Abraham knew that the time of the promise was getting close it had to be he was a hundred years old he was expecting at any time he was watching every minute and when he run in and told Sarah this I believe is our day of visitation she kind of looked at him with those big guys and thought well Abraham you've said that a long time but you know know there will come a time when it will be so if God said so then when the angel took his chair and leaned back and he said Abraham sing that you've got favor with God that you are an heir of the world and you're going to be the father of many nations you believe that since you were 75 years old for 25 years otherwise you've waited for this and promised Child by Sarah now I'm not going to keep this from you and what I'm going to do I'm going to visit you according to the time of life and you know Sarah in there ear dropping kindly halfway in an upset mood from her condition that morning she thought in her heart now isn't that a silly thing think in our day me an old woman as old as I am here I am 90 years old and there sets my husband Abraham 100 years old it's not been with me as women for 50 years and what we've been married since we since we were 17 him about 27 how could it how could that be just how could it be see she had herself all out of condition to receive it when God brought it praise the Lord now God gives his word and he expects his bride to be sensitive to him well praise the Lord I I I don't care well glory to God here I am I just got a few quotes put down here I told you I'm not going to be long but because I've only got a few quotes Hallelujah amen our our not now sisters I you know he's still your husband whether you're in a good mood or a bad mood you owe him that respect whether you're in a good mood or bad mood he is your leader whether you feel good or whether you feel bad it don't matter what change you're going through it don't matter what cycles of life you're in you should show the love the honor the respect to your man can I hear an amen sister man that's the way it should be having that kind Hallelujah now you should be ashamed of yourself whenever you're feeling bad and you're nervous I understand being nervous but the scripture says the scripture says that you are to rule your spirit don't let your spirit get out of control I've got a scripture on that there in Proverbs 16 and 32 and the last part of it he says he that ruleth his spirit I'll just read the whole thing he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty he that ruleth his Spirit then he that takes a city what what does that word rule mean it means to take dominionship of praise the Lord now now here Sarah was in a in a in a in a bad mood Amen brother Brandon says here she's in that shape saying now how could that happen in our modern time see she's got herself all out of shape amen Abraham out there waiting with anticipation it wasn't made known to her it was made known to them that was looking for it that's the way it comes yet to those who are looking so he was watching Abraham was and he says this he says now oh my don't never get that in your heart be open be ready she missed it she failed to see it and maybe if we don't watch Friends the church is going to fail to see it that's not look for the church hairdos and new dresses let's look for the Holy Spirit to come in the Supernatural and raise some things the church don't need a facelift it needs a birth the Holy Ghost to come into the church bring back the people that brings the Supernatural and holds on and waiting for the coming of the Lord as if it is it might be any hour living in those kind of conditions that's the kind of bride we should be to Christ praise the Lord God's given me a promise I believe him I trust him I'm looking well praise the Lord amen now now when the lamb has taken the title deed now what did what did the lamb do to this with this title deed he did not keep it to himself he came to his wife and he's handed her the checkbook anything you ask in my name I'll give it to you well praise the Lord amen whatsoever things you say you shall have what you say he knows old church if we just had that kind of confidence in ourselves the way God has the confidence why would he call you why would he why would he give you this message why why would he why would he call you to himself if you weren't his very own why would he say he said if you weren't his very own now you're gonna you're gonna sit there and Snicker at it and laugh at it and and and and and wonder about it are we going to get up and say I believe what my heavenly bridegroom has brought to me in this day told me he's giving me the checkbook he's giving me an open book he said if you speak it you can have the same Authority that I have to take somebody to stand there with us with faith and saying Lord I want to be at one with you I want to be one with you can you say man amen hallelujah Can someone say Amen the blood of redemption has settled the sin question the blood of redemption has totally settled the same question there is nothing to hold you away you say but I fell this morning there's still blood for you little bride he loves you man now this is the the the first church the Apostle Paul to his congregation I mean they're in in first uh Corinthians 4 19 he said I'm going to come to you shortly if the Lord be willing amen and I will know I will know not the speech of of of a church member but I want to see the power I I I you say your bride I I want to see some power that's bright I I want to I want to see a girl acting like bride I I want are you hearing me not a church member a church member but believers bring in the word of God to pass what glory of God what kind of Faith should that be the Apostle Paul says now I'm going to look and I don't want to hear known this well I'm A Hallelujah I'm a Christian no I want to see the power in your life and then I'll tell who's who and what's what kind of an attitude of faith we should have brother Brandon says when God and a Believer meets there's two omnipotence because a man is a part of God he's a Son of God see and what little he is it joins with the entire body of Christ now I want you to listen to that again when the believer in God meets that's two omnipotents he's part of God and what little he is someone say hallelujah he joins with the entire body Jesus said over Mark 11 and 22 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said it shall come to pass believe what you have said a Christian is so much with with uh put that around him is an atmosphere did you ever meet people that you just love to be with you you ever you ever had that why why they create the atmosphere about their life the way they live and the things that they think about and the love they have for you you've heard my message on the opossum you know and on on the bees trying to sting me and the Bulls trying to kill me the animals you see you create an atmosphere and that's the atmosphere you have to be in in order to pray for the sick it's the same thing it's love that casts out those evil spirits oh Walking In Love amen how many wants to walk in love Hallelujah well you gotta love him first the only way you can have confidence in him is to love him if you don't love him you won't have confidence in him if you love him you're not going to be going to be around accusing him of being a liar not going to be accusing him but you of him he's proven to you that he loves you he's proven to what can you say man so so here we stand tonight not accusing Christ not saying where have you been no we're believing with every ounce of breath we have in us we believe Christ and well do you love him he says when he arose he conquered hell he went up conquered everything that was against mankind The Wine Press of God crushed it down conquered death held grave sickness formalities everything else overcame it all and on the third day he rose on the third day conquered all the atmospheres above and cut the Mist between God and man and he has now connected Heaven and Earth together Glory oh my there he stands the mighty conqueror since he rent The Veil into there he is he has the keys of both death and Hell hanging on his side fear not he says laid his right hand his power upon him and raised him up by the power of His right hand and said don't fear I'm he that was he that is and shall come I'm the first and the last I'm he that lived and died and alive again forevermore oh behold the Conqueror Lo Behold Him in plain view there he stands the mighty conqueror since he rent The Veil into he's cut every obstacle from the human beings that they might be connected like it was in the Garden of Eden I was going to choke it but I'm going to say it man is omnipotent you don't believe it but he is a man fully surrendered to God somebody say a man fully surrendered to God is our omnipotent did not he say in Mark 11 and 22 whatsoever things you say and you don't doubt in your heart it'll come to pass you can have what you say what happens when two omnipotence meet when God and man comes together two omnipotent something's got to shake whatsoever you would say with that creative power of the omnipotence of God knowing that he promised it he said it in his word he creates a power that goes out yonder and brings it to pass things that is not it makes them as though they are because two on magnificence have met what is what are these two omnipotence what is it's it's this you're made of the same stuff it's husband and wife you come from eternity when Christ was laying in the grave part Eternal part of God was manifested at Pentecost when he rose from the grave he took all your sins and now that Eternal part of God is made manifest in you declaring himself through you oh we've heard it all the sun has gone away and the moon has to shine now we still get our power from him but we're reflecting him the Moon is got the same stuff it's got a reflecting power what he says can be reflected in me his power the power of the sun shining upon me of causes me to shine I have no ability of my own I have no power of my own there's nothing within me that can create but I can take his words I can believe what he has to say and I can say I stand as God would stand and believe as God would believe okay yes yes it's two omnipotents it's two eternals he's the source of eternal life but I came from God praise the Lord do you love him you see where are you biting in where are you at you can Joy in him as you can Joy in your in your maker Hallelujah Hallelujah can I just say it this way and I know these boys once I say these these boys gonna say wow that would be so awesome why would you what would you boys think if you had the opportunity to create your own wife I mean wow Hallelujah create amen some of you are blushing over there amen create your own life you couldn't be you couldn't be upset about the creation because Caleb you'd be responsible for the creation the Bible says that Jesus created his own wife that's what brother Adam said in the in the church age book he said you are his creation Jesus Christ created his very own bride and he loves her amen he created you he built you he loves you he wants you what kind of Joy would be in our heart if we had that kind of a revelation that the creator has created me and that the creator has got me in his hands and he loves me you're talking about the joy of the Lord you see the joy of the Lord can be in any situation the joy of the Lord should be in every every stage of your life the joy of the Lord can be in in in in your in it when you're sick you can still have the joy of the Lord when you're in a like when you're going to the blah part of your life you can still have the joy of the Lord when when you're when you're weary and you're as we were saying this morning amen and you get so fatigued but yet way down deep inside there's still something there that says I love him come on Church come on Amen why because you're a part of him that doesn't separate you when you're in the trial they don't separate you when you're when you're going through the valley no you're you're wary you're tired you're you're wore out in your mind and your body or how whatever else but the relationship that that can that that relationship between you and God is still just as real and eternal even in those dark times I love him can you sing that amen Oh I wanna I wanna abide it's the psalmist says let me abide in that secret place there in Psalms 81 or 91 don't even let me let me let me abide in that secret place with the most high God you know what he's trying to say there's just that place between me and my guy Hallelujah I'm his guy well glory to God Amen I'm his wife and he can pull me up and hug on me and give me a little kiss and tell me what he well praise the Lord amen hallelujah well yes I still believe I don't care how long you've been married your wife should look forward to you coming her jumping on your lap we Jesse and I don't jump on each other's laps anymore they mind but I but neither one of us have got much of a lap amen but we but we've got but we've got we love one another praise the Lord and that relationship has only grown it's grown to the UPS the Downs the ends the outs amen is that right Hallelujah oh my God what a deal Hallelujah where are you at they're in Isaiah 57 and 15 it says for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble to revive the heart of the contrite ones did you know that they're in the Book of James amen it says James four and five he said do you think the scripture saith in vain that the spirit dwelleth in that dwelleth in others lusteth to envy but he giveth more grace wherefore he says God resisteth the proud but gives Grace Under The Humble submit yourselves therefore to God resists the devil and he'll flee from you draw nigh to God and he God will draw night to you It's A Love Affair it's just it's just a big love affair between you and your creator praise the Lord amen I want I want I I don't want to ever come out of that place I want to be submissive to him man I want to have the right mental attitude is that right psalm 16 and 11 thou will show me the path of life and in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore though a thousand fall to my ten thousand to my right or left and and a thousand to my right I might have those mixed up amen but yet the Lord keeps his hands upon me because he loves me somebody say I love you Lord I love you I love you Lord I'm part of this I'm part of something that is bigger than me amen I want to it's important that I keep my attitude right before God it's important Hallelujah now listen you shouldn't have that attitude towards your husband but you shouldn't have that attitude towards your God amen and it works both ways amen husband shouldn't have attitudes towards their wives you love your wife respect your wife give honor to that wife is that right amen it's quite interesting that the Bible says for the man to love his wife and it says for the woman to respect her husband now it's all it's all love but but it's it's it's two different things why would the reference to your husband why respect reverence is because he's ordained to lead he is to love you provide for you give to you but his needs are met when he is honored respected reverenced God gives to us and how we love him is to respect his amen God you said it and I'm not going to question it I believe you Lord I believe you're able is that right I believe you're able I believe you're more than able and God says huh I resist the proud but I give I give grace to the humble but I give a lot of Grace to that one that is gratefully humble I I give I give abundant grace to that one who was seeking me and coming in a man and loving me I want to be I want that gal to be next to me can you see man amen Hallelujah so you got me am I making any sense I'm making any sense here tonight Jesus was convinced as as the musicians come Jesus was convinced that he would raise up on the third day he was so convinced that he said you destroy this Temple and I'll raise it up the third day David in the scripture under the inspiration of prophet David was a prophet you know and David under the inspiration prophesied and says I will not leave his soul in hell neither suffer my Holy One to see corruption he knew that sometime within 72 hours before corruption said in that body he would raise up 72 hours is three days and nights so he said destroy it I'll raise it up fairly convinced that's right that he would raise it up again he knew the scriptures can't fail and then brother Branham stands there and says I'm convinced that he's the same yesterday today and forever history and the message I'm preaching Vince that it's the truth vents that these Visions come from God I'm convinced we're living in the last days I am convinced that this very Spirit that's on me now is the Holy Ghost I'm thoroughly convinced you want to please the Lord you want some abundance of Grace you just start you just start getting an attitude of Thoroughly convinced you you get an attitude of I'm convinced I'm convinced foreign he says I'm convinced that the Holy Ghost is the right his way is right I'm convinced the Bible weighs the truth I'm convinced that it is Jesus Christ right here now I'm convinced if we believed him at this moment I'm convinced that he would heal every sick person in a moment in a twinkling of an eye I'm convinced he would pour out the Holy Ghost upon here till there would be such a shout till hard to tell what would take place I'm convinced I believe it with all of my heart not because I'm an old man I've preached this when I was a kid not over 20 years old I'm convinced since the day I've been convinced since the day met me on the river Hallelujah I'm convinced that he's here now I'm convinced and the pillar of fire is the same Pillar of Fire that was with Israel in the wilderness is the same Pillar of Fire with the church today Glory I'm convinced it's right it I I've gave my life for it I've left home and everything else again get me and give my everything for it I'm convinced it's the truth I'm convinced he's here now I'm convinced that this spirit that is here now is the holy spirit I'm convinced we're baptized into his Spirit right now I know it's the truth I'm fairly convinced that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I'm convinced perfectly convinced now he had to be he had to be in order to stand up there someone asked him they said are you are you ever worried that you're going to miss it he said no not at all [Music] as long as I'm prepared and I'm waiting on him and he does the speaking [Music] he just uses my voice he promised me that no matter what came my way that he would stand right there with me I am not afraid now that was a prophet that I want to say as the bride he was a bride member he was part of the Bride just as you that you have now you might not be a prophet and take God's word and say he will never fail me he'll never fail me do you believe that here tonight Hallelujah oh I love him Hallelujah man I want to arm myself I want to stand right there Psalm 62 and five my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is for him only as my rock and my salvation he is my defense and I shall not be moved can you say man and God is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God well glory to God amen I love him oh my let me bring my attitudes under control was that right bring my attitudes under control bring my heart under control bring my thoughts under control bring everything I am under control to the word of God oh bless the Lord bless the Lord now now you shouldn't be doing that as I say you you if if you're treating your husband wrong you shouldn't do that you treat your wife wrong you shouldn't do that amen but Saints God has never fails [Music] and and I want to tell you he's given his life he's given his life for this for this church he's given his life for this bride man praise the Lord [Music] Hallelujah I love him for he his mind [Music] I love him for he is divine I love him it's true oh is Jesus [Music] died for me sing it to him now personal I love you for you [Music] are mine I love you for you Divine [Music] I love you forever [Music] you were Jesus who died [Music] you see brother Branham says it's when you are discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you when he gets you and if you come to church and say well I don't know I just don't know whether I'll get any better or not I've been prayed for twice oh my he says you might as well stay home that's all but when you can cast that aside God don't want you to be frowning God wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer will cause cancer don't never be upset just walk in his love knowing that you're walking in him nothing can harm you nothing he repeats it nothing can harm you there's neither Powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him we're in him we've never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him so it's his business to take care of what he what he it's his business to take care of what he took himself no man can pluck them from my father's hand because he's the greatest of them all amen it's the father who takes care of it has got any more power than God so what kind of power have you got what kind of a power have you got over you to take care of you the whole power that created the universe it took the solar system brother Branham makes a blowing sound blue like that and every Star went to its place sure he watches over you that's the kind of father we have how much he loves if he sees a little sparrow that falls If he if he takes care of of the Lily if he does all of these things how much more does he love his people [Music] praise the Lord you love him now for a body [Music] you can be seated for just a moments clearly that that one that one video I want you to play you you have that by chance amen I we I've played this years ago but I want to play this for you here this morning but we're a part of a body and you you you're you're not powerful on your own you're not powerful first thing you want to do whenever you're whenever you're you're discouraged what do you want to do pull away can I hear an amen you want to go do your own thing pull away amen why because that's that's that's the spirit that comes with discouragement when you're sick there's spirits that come with discouragement how many knows that spirits of depression follow sickness amen there are spirits that come with discouragement and they attach themselves and they they they they they they they they Lord it over on you man they they do and they want to pull you off and and out because you are only powerful praying for one and even with one another I think that's the reason why I think that's the reason why we should call with one another and and especially especially for those I you know I I I told Brother Harry the other day brother Harry and sister Stephanie I said you know we we don't tell you all the time you guys are way off over in no man's land over there in that foreign country of Stillwater and uh and uh you know but we do think about you and we're praying for you the same way with you guys I mean you guys are you're not out of mind you're out of sight but not out of mind amen and and we love we we love those that we love it that when we're all around even if we don't talk to each other here in Pawnee all the time just knowing that we're there with each other just knowing that knowing that yeah I see brother William you know he passes he'll he'll wave at me or I'll see somebody and we'll you know and and and and there's just that camaraderie or however you say it amen [Music] because there's something about there's something about that Unity and don't ever no one think don't don't ever think that no one loves you because sometimes that's Spirit of discouragement I mean you don't have to you don't have to be in in uh uh Missouri a man to feel like you're all alone you could be you could be living at my house and feel like you're all alone and here amen we've we've almost got the entire block conquered amen and uh we but but we can still be alone we can still feel alone but that's that's where as a body we need one another pray for one another amen this is an older video but I want I want I want to play it amen and go ahead sister keys praise the Lord it is very important for God's chosen people not to be left alone in the season this video depicts exactly why right now the lion is being surrounded by a pack of 20 hyenas even though he is noted as the king of the jungle their goal is to weigh him down so that they can easily go in for the kill just as the enemy tries to overwhelm us with bills attacks on our health finances and overall relationships too many of us don't understand that when we are left alone we're easily defeated especially when we have no help [Music] [Music] Gus and his disciples out two by two because the power of two of God chosen people exceeds the power of 20 demons pray for your help because when your help shows up the odds change as the commentator States the power of two male lions could easily defeat the pack of 20 hyenas years ago I prayed and asked God for a prayer partner I needed a warrior a Divine connection to fulfill the work at hand as life can be very cumbersome I commission you even now to pre-impress God for your help and for those who are blessed with such a bond never allow pettiness prior to outside people to take away the very thing that's meant to keep you alive in the season when God has pair two together nothing can defeat you foreign amen and we are Victorious we are ferocious we are a man this omnipotent Supernatural race of omnipotent God amen but we do need one another don't we amen when we get discouraged don't don't don't don't don't don't don't don't hide amen I've got a saying that I've Allelujah that I've always
