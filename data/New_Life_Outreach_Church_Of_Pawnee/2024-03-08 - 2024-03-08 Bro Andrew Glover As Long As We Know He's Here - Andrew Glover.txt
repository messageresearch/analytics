from our past Pastor brother Shawn Martin the Saints there at Faith Tabernacle I I know there's a whole group of them here brother Kevin sister Melissa brought them down on the van and so we sure glad

tonight I see too many ministers to start calling names and pastors but we say God bless you all and we appreciate your support and appreciate you being here and amen tonight if you have your Bibles we want to go to the Book of Matthew the 11th chapter The Book of Matthew the 11th chapter and then also we're going to go to James chapter 3 Matthew chapter 11 and verse number one amen we also want to say it's good to have my wife here with me she's here somewhere I seen her just a minute ago anden we're sure glad to have her and and Malachi with us here this weekend and amen it's just a special time to serve the Lord amen amen Matthew chapter 11 and verse number one the Bible says it came to pass that when Jesus had made an end of commanding his 12 disciples he departed th to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and he said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another and Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them now watch verse number six and blessed is he so there's a blessing here whosoever shall not be offended in me blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me now in the Book of James the 3 chapter the Book of James the 3 chapter I want to read one verse there in James chapter 3 and verse number 13 James chapter 3 and verse number 13 you love the Lord tonight amen James chapter 3 and: 13 the Bible says who is a wise man and and endued with knowledge somebody say endued with knowledge who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good conversation his works with the meekness of wisdom we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments if I would take a title tonight I want to talk to you on this thought of as long as we know he's here as long as we know that he is here in the message healing and what is sickness 1950 brother said we think of one time that we were aliens we were cut off from God without Mercy but Christ died in our stad the innocent for the guilty he said and now we are the sons and daughters of God I love that right now we are the sons and daughters of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know we'll have a body like his own glorious body for we shall see him amen as he is free from sickness free from pain he said and God that glorious day of redemption is coming amen for all nature is groaning for that day he said now we're on the very threshold of the door to Break Forth into that great golden age that all the prophets have spoke of signs and wonders has been wrought by thy servants throughout the land now listen at this to turn the people back to a knowledge The Presence of Jehovah God in our midst amen the signs and the Wonders that have been wrought by the Servants of God have been done to turn the church back to a knowledge of The Presence of Jehovah God in our midst you know last night when I got back to my room I was just sitting there and meditating on some things and the spirit of the Lord just spoke these words to My Heart amen that this is a generation that is endued with the knowledge of his presence amen a generation that is in endued with the knowledge of his presence in James 3:13 he said who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you now look at this endued with knowledge it means that it is intelligent amen it is experienced it is one having the knowledge of an expert amen if you have been endued with knowledge that has not come from somebody that does not know what they're talking about but that has come from somebody that knows exactly what they're talking about amen and when we begin to declare the presence of Jesus Christ we're not declaring that from some psychologist we're not declaring that from some denominational preacher but we are declaring that from a Vindicated Prophet amen who had the ability to say that he's not standing three feet from where I am right now amen he is here I believe it's Moses when he met the burning bush I can say it like this Moses became an expert when Moses met the pillar of fire he became an expert Moses he said after God gave him 40 Years of teaching amen he was 80 years old could you imagine how ridiculous to the carnal mind this would be amen here was Moses in the presence amen of The Burning Bush was better equipped Amen in five minutes in the presence of God Amen than 80 years of school it had give him he said in the presence of God five minutes amen gave him more knowledge of God and better equipped him amen than 80 years of schooling brother we don't need so much theology amen but we need neology amen 5 minutes in the presence of the burning bush amen 80 years he had shined amen 40 years on the desert running amen but five minutes in the presence of God at the burning bush he was ready to go and I want to say what we don't need is a new quotebook amen we don't need a new idea we don't need a new doctrine amen but what we need is to get in the presence of God until every idea every tradition every unbelieving Spirit can die in the presence of God and we can be raised to the power of the Holy Ghost I believe that it might take eight it might have took Moses 80 years Amen to get all the theology out of it amen and 40 years in the desert amen but five minutes in the presence of God Amen showed Moses that our God Amen is an ontime God he's an end time God every time God let me say this tonight my God is always on time my God is always on time with his message he said I believe today we are facing a great something amen that the church should know and understand we ought to know what all this is about amen and Def find it in God's word for I believe that if it isn't in the word he said that I'm just a little bit doubtful of it but if God's word speaks of it amen no matter how indifferent it might seem to our custom of teaching amen it's God working out his word and many times it's contrary to our way of thinking or maybe we've been taught to think amen but we have to recognize the omnipotence of God when it is performed before us listen I believe that our God is an omnipotent God and I believe that he has the power Amen to come into this building tonight and to perform a manifestation of his omnipotence to every believer amen the same way that he did to Moses the same way that he did to Noah the same way that he did to Joshua listen we are not a bunch of theological intellectual Canary Birds amen we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and if Moses was led by the pillar of fire amen we are led by the pillar of fire and wherever the pillar of fire goes we will follow the pillar of fire because it's not theology it is reality amen when God comes in our midst he begins to perform the omnipotence and we begin to recognize it now when we read there in Matthew chap 11 if you stud study the message you know that brother B calls that the forgotten beatitude I love how brother bcll said it he said it's the Forgotten beatitude rediscovered when you read Matthew 11 you're not thinking about the Beatitudes amen because Matthew 5 is were all there recorded amen but in Matthew 11 brother says that is the Forgotten beatitude he said and what happened amen is John found himself in jail now I want to say this to you John was not in jail because he robbed a bank he was not in jail because he was selling drugs or amen doing something wrong amen his ministry put him in jail John's Ministry literally put him Amen in the prison cell now I want you to think about something amen here is John the Baptist amen who goes from the Wilderness all the way to the jail amen but I want to say this to you amen but in the jail he was still John amen now let me say what John had amen John had an Eagle Eye he had a he had a prophetic eye and when John got in the jail brother said his Eagle Eye or prophetic eye had become filmed over he said now watch when trouble set in amen Jesus come and showed the Messiah that he was Messiah but then something went wrong see John had introduced the Messiah with a fan in his hand going to burn up the cha but he found out amen that the works of Jesus was meek and lowly amen so it worried him he didn't know what to say amen he thought amen now there's something wrong here somewhere he said seemed he had beli the wrong thing it seemed like it wasn't working right and there's many times that we think that too that it isn't working right amen but it is working right he said as long as we know that he's here amen then what difference does it make amen as long as we know as long as the acknowledgement has come into our life that Jesus Christ is not in a Gra in Jerusalem he's not in a tomb in Jeffersonville he's not on the cross of Calvary but he's here in the power of his resurrection then it can rain or it can shine and we'll have church it can be cold or it can be warm and we'll have church there can be two or 200 of us and we'll have church because our Revival is not built on the knowledge of some man it's not built on the knowledge of some system our Revival is built on the knowledge that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and his word is in the midst of his church and he's got the same Dynamic power to do exactly what his word said he would do listen our Revival is not coming from who's not here our Revival is coming from who is here and who is here is Jesus Christ and he's the king of kings he's the Lord of lords he's the God that was he oh let me just bag on him for a minute he's the god that is and he's the god that'll always be he's the Everlasting time father he is the Prince of Peace he is the counselor he is Jehovah Gyra he is Jehovah Rafa he is Jehovah n he is Elohim he is Elia he is everything and he is in this building tonight in the power of his resurrection he ain't in a grave in Jeffersonville he ain't in a tomb in Jerusalem he's here in the power of his word and as long as we know he's here what difference does it make well I might as well preach there for a second as long as we know he's here what difference does it make well my favorite preacher ain't here but he's here well my favorite singer ain't here but he's here well my best friend ain't here but he's here come on church amen well my boyfriend or girlfriend ain't here but he's here so if he's here we can have Camp if he's here the saved can be saved if he's here the sick can be healed if he's here the dead can be raised if he's here the blind eyes can come open if he's here the poor can have the gospel preached to him if he's here sickness is defeated if he's here every devil is defeated if he's here as long as we know that he's here then what difference does it make it's working right maybe it working according to the way we think it ought to work but it's working according to the way God wants it to work now there's a powerful point right there things will not always work the way you think they ought to work but what difference does it make if it's working the way God thinks it all to work for my Bible says that we know all things work together for the good to them who are the called according Amen to his purpose now let me say this when trouble sets in is when people forget when trouble begins to set in is when people begin to forget can I say this what we forget is what we should remember and what we remember is what we should forget see right now amen some of you are remembering situations that you should have forgot a long time ago and forgetting the promise of God as the change to the situation you are remembering the sickness but you're forgetting Isaiah 53 you're forgetting the cross of Calvary you're forgetting the atonement you're forgetting the stripes that was placed upon is back amen but what about tonight if you can forget about the sickness and remember the healer if you can forget about the problem and remember the answer if you can forget about the question and remember that Jesus Christ is Arisen from the grave and he's here in power to manifest himself amen we ought to forget what we we shouldn't forget what we should remember but we ought to forget we ought to forget the things that has no value to them now Matthew y'all are preaching me I'm trying to lay a foundation but don't quit in Matthew chapter 11 the Bible said that John amen literally goes to Jesus and asks him two questions he says now aren't thou he that should come amen or do we look for another now as long as John was on the River Jordan baptizing there was no question as long as John was preaching there was no question but the minute that trouble set in is when John begin to say are you the Messiah or do we look for another you see what happened was amen that questioning arises in the time of trouble you know today the prophet of God says we're living in a world that is full of questioning he says there's a literally a question mark over the entire world do you realize right now there's a question mark over the White House there's a question mark over the nomination there's a question mark over education there's a question there's a question mark all over the world Amen and what Satan has done is he's trying to move people from Faith to doubt amen by one simple thing and that's to get you to question do you realize when you're on the mountain you never question if God loves you when the bank account's full you never question if God loves you when everything's working just right you never question if God is for you but the minute things start falling apart and the clouds start gathering in the sky and something goes wrong and something falls apart is the very minute the Devil comes in and begins to move you from Faith to doubt and you begin to say well I don't know if God loves me and I don't know if this message is for me amen I don't know if I'm going to make the Rapture I don't know if I'm an overcomer amen but I come here tonight to say Amen that we're not a bunch of babies but we are adopted manifested sons of God and we have been endued amen with the knowledge of his presence I'll tell you why the devil hates us amen it's cuz we know how to take a licking and keep on chicken we know how to take a bad day and keep on praise and we know how to take trials and disappointments and every negative thing the devil can throw at us and still lift up her hands and say but God was on my side it don't matter who's against me if the Lord is for me that I'm going to make it I've already made it I'm talking about some young people I'm talking about a generation that has been baptized with a Heavenly knowledge of the virtues of the perfect man you know that God is right you know his word is true and you know he's [Applause] here hey somebody shout he's here the devil tried to get John to disbelieve amen that Jesus was the Messiah so what he do he put him in jail now when Jesus heard that John was in jail brother Frank he never put a pamphlet together and nailed it to the jail housee and said here's how to be happy in jail literature remember said no he said you just stay on this afternoon's meeting you just stay till this is over then you can leave see just watch this afternoon's meeting and see there's John he he said oh my amen now watch after Jesus had the meeting I imagine those Disciples of John was sitting there they were watching every movie made now watch here because John had taught them that he was the Messiah now can I drop something here to you amen that questioning does not just begin with you but when you begin to question one thing it begins to affect everything around you in other words John was teaching them that Jesus was the Messiah but but now that John is in the prison he's now teaching his followers a question of is he the Messiah or not amen I might as well preach I'm here in other words amen when you put one question mark on one thing in this message it don't just stop there but you'll put one here and then you'll put one there now come on momies and daddies amen you put one question mark on the way a boy or girl ought to dress it won't stop there it'll move to the way they ought to be baptized and it'll move the way they ought to go to church or stay home and let in the tapes amen but I think it's time Amen to remove the question mark and put an exclamation mark across this message it's the truth there's no doubt in it there's no confusion in it it is the divine revelation of Jesus Christ that has been revealed in this generation I'm not confused Le ought to see is confused but I'm not confused I know who I am I know what I'm believing I know who called me I know who redeemed me I know who just ified me I know who Sanctified me I know who filled me with the Holy Ghost and I know some of these mornings what I'm believing it's going to lead me into a body change I refuse I refuse I refuse to question this message it's the truth period ain't putting no question marks on anything so John had questions now the disciples have got questions but they begin to see what has taking place remember since we after the service they went over and there was two disciples they went back to meet John now here's what Jesus said he said you go tell John that the lame walk and the blind see and the deaf hear and all that comes to the meeting is poor but the Poor People's got the gospel preached to them and tell John not to be scared and not to think anything different I'm right on schedule everything is running right everything's all right I'm right on schedule see go tell them there's a healing service going on tell them the poor is got the gospel preached and the power of God is moving among them I'm right on schedule are you ready for this don't pay attention to nothing else don't you pay attention to nothing else I am right on schedule I love that word schedule it means to arrange or to plan for an event to take place at a particular time so it's it's not as brother Timothy said it's not something haphazardly happening he me no what it is is God has a schedule he has a particular time he has a specific time he has an appointed time he has a due time are you hearing me and God is not behind schedule and he's not ahead of schedule but he's right on schedule now here's what happened though is John finds himself in a prison do you know as believer sometimes that we find our in the prison sometimes as Believers we find ourselves in prisons but can I say this to you amen that the prison it never lessened John's value John was John regardless of where he was amen if he was at the river of Jordan he was John if he was preaching to the to the to the Pharisees and Sadducees he was John can I say this if he was in the prison he was John so what that tells me is is is your habitation does not change your value so so you're right here smack dab in the middle of leosia but you're still the Queen of Heaven you're right here in the middle of confusion but you're still an invincible Army you're right here in the middle of an age where boys don't know if they're boys and girls don't know if they're girls but you have been endued with the knowledge of Jesus Christ to know that as long as he's here every everything is okay John was in a prison he was there both naturally and spiritually can I tell you what kind of prison John was in he was in a prison of offense now let me just preach to you for a minute amen because John was offended because things did not turn out amen the way he thought they should turn out what put you in a prison of offense is when things don't turn out the way you think they ought to turn out or the way you have for them to turn out amen and God says no I I got a different plan I've got a different thoughts I've got a different agenda for your life then what you've got to do is either surrender to his plan or continue to follow your plan and before long you'll be in a prison of offense and you'll be offended at everybody and anybody well we might as well preach you'll be offended to singers you'll be offended to deacons you'll be offended to youth leaders you'll be offended at your parents you you you'll be just an offense amen because things didn't turn out well it's here I might as well preach well if it would have went this way that would have worked out if that hadn't happened then I would have had this and if they hadn't said that then I would have been a and you got all that figured out in your mind amen but don't let me let me bust your bubble but you're in a prison because right now the word's going forth and that prison bar has got you so tied up you can't even raise your hands and say that all things does work together for the good to them that love God that prison has got you so bad up you can't even say yes Lord amen it was different than what I imagined but your ways are not my ways and your thoughts are not my faults but you know what we need to do we need to come to a realization that it's not in our hands it's not in a preacher's hands it's in the hands of the man who stepped out on nothing and created everything and if he can put the stars in their place if he can put the sun in its place if he can put the moon in its place and he can take you and positionally place you in the position that God has given you don't you ever forget this our thoughts according to Isaiah 55 are not his thoughts amen our thoughts are lower than his thoughts and brother said here's what happened he said John be to think well I introduced him as a messiah he had a fan in his hand he was going to purge the floor he was going to take the wheat to the garer and I told them that the axe was going to be laid to the root of the tree and he was going to take all the trash and burn it up amen and here he is instead instead of a Great Mighty Man like that here he comes meek and lowly and something must have went wrong somewhere he said there's no doubt but something's wrong somewhere he thought it wasn't right modern events 1965 brother man picks this up and says see John said oh his fan is in his hand he'll thoroughly Purge the floor brother said John thought the Millennium would start right then he thought the grain was ready but it had to die and go into the stalk and come up again to make the true bride so in other words John was offended because something was not happening but it couldn't happen because Branson you wasn't even born yet it couldn't happen silus cuz you wasn't even on the earth yet amen what John was talking about was the truth and it was God's will it was God's plan but it could not happen until the seed went in the ground and come back to make a true word bride let me just say this amen and you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you are the ones that John was offended about you are the ones that John was tore up about you oh come on church amen but let me say this if John can look over the banister rail tonight I want to say John don't be tore up no more amen because what you was looking for is here tonight it's here in Bride form it's here in young people it's in a generation that has been endued with the knowledge of the presence of God listen you didn't become the bride by way you feel you didn't become the bride by the church you go to you came by the bride by the word of God made manifest in the age you were living in John got dismayed John got dismayed the same as we get dismayed brother said oh the other night I had so many people come in and say well brother brandom I was prayed for I really didn't get any different well there's something wrong no there's not can I give this to you there's nothing wrong with the system there's nothing wrong with God there's nothing wrong with the Bible there's nothing wrong with the Holy Spirit the thing of it is is something's wrong with you there's nothing wrong with the message there's nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost there's nothing wrong with the pillar of fire the thing that's wrong is us and what's made us wrong is our thoughts and our agendas and our motives and our objectives amen and John was offended at Jesus and brother said there's more people offended at Jesus more than any other person ever lived on the earth he said but blessed is he who's not offended in me don't be offended in me no matter what takes place everything's working right on schedule are you ready for this so you just go ahead and believe it that's all everything's all right just go ahead and believe it amen if you want to stay out of the prison of offence here's the way you do it when things don't go your way you just say Lord I will trust you when I cannot Trace you I am not walking walking by sight I am walking by faith and this didn't go the way I thought come on church I'm preaching to you now amen because offended people getting pull pits I just come out offended people getting pull pits and they get up there and they offend the rest of us cuz they're offended so they get up and say well if so and so is preaching y'all be saying Amen brother so and so was here y'all be shout amen it's a bad time to push I got a sword amen if so and so was saying this amen but no the problem is is you made yourself something God didn't make you and so now everybody else is offended because you're offended but whatever just happened to be what God called us to be and being satisfied in the position God called us to stand in if he called us to preach every week then preach every week if he called you to preach once a week then preach once a week well you say preacher that don't apply to the young people amen I believe I'm preaching to some young preachers that's going to raise up and going to carry this message but God in heaven know know the last thing we need is another preacher with a complex in the pull pit it's the last thing we need is another preacher all tore up go so and so let it go and remember that God is in control and if he can use John he can use you Just Surrender and say God whatever you want God whatever you desire that's what I want that's what I surrender to I don't want what I want I want what you want Lord y'all know it's the truth y'all sit through them sermons Oh Glory to God offended at everybody and everything cuz they didn't get the ministry they thought Mama thought they should have had come on we don't need any more complex singers we've heard enough we've had enough complex specials come on Church well if so and so was singing you all would enjoy that if so and so was sing did you see they clap for so and so 5 minutes and when I sung they didn't even clap did you see when sister so and so got up there the whole church got on their feet but when I got up to sing they got up and went to the bathroom amen why don't you get rid of the complex and quit singing for the glory of somebody and sing for the glory of God if it moves the church to move with them if it causes somebody to cry and cry with him but let's get rid of all the nonsense and just get back to having church again where the power of the Holy Ghost broke out in the services and the sick were healed and the dead were raised and Devils were cast out and the anointing had a liberty to bless somebody get out of the prison of offense and come back to the message of the hour and be what God called you to be offenses now I think that devil got out of here and if God does call you to preach do us all a favor study the message and preach it is that too much to ask anden don't go bury your head and psychology don't go we all getting tired but I'll preach through it don't go bury your head in some man's idea go get your tape and listen to what a prophet said and go tell somebody what a prophet said and leave all the non out of it and be a young man that God can use to slay Goliath to slay Philistines by the power of the sword of the Lord that's been revealed in the generation you're living in you say preacher are you trying to call preachers no I'm just giving the call some Liberty if it's there well come on Church brother said young men will sweep this message on to the coming of the Lord get out of the prison of offense oh mercy look at Daniel 12 now we're I think that devil got out of here we're not going to be offended Believers we're going to be Christians we're going to be grown-ups this ain't the message Got Talent it's the house of God this ain't America's Got Talent it's the house of God this ain't about who's who and who did what who said what who sung what it's about the Manifest station of the glory of God coming in the church to heal somebody listen we got a Rapture to take we got a body change to step into we got a theophany and a future home I say lay aside all the childish playground games and come back to the word of God and stand on the word of God and be a word bride let all the nonsense go be a new generation that's endued with the knowledge of the presence of Jesus Christ and if I can't get away from and if God does call you to preach and you stand before five stand there with an authority that wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there I will be in the midst if God does call you to sing and he send you to the nursing home go down there and sing with the anointing of Malachi 4 resting upon the gift that God has placed in your life come on be a Christian and get out of the prison of offense and let God have his way in your life just settle down and be thankful that God called you just settle down and be thankful that God spared you there were Millions lost on the night he saved your soul but he saved you for a purpose so be what God called you to be and let everything else go because when we get offended people we start having offended meetings and can't nobody sing can't nobody shout can't nobody Dance Can't Nobody run can't nobody enjoy the Holy Ghost amen you know what they say they say well I'm just preaching they said well you know I'm a little bit sick of singing this song you don't know like I know amen cuz every time they sing it somebody jumps up and starts dancing amen well has it ever dawned on you that maybe they know that God has done something for them has it ever dawned on you that maybe they was in the Midnight Hour and the Holy Ghost come into their life and delivered them from a prison I it ever dawned on you that maybe they didn't have enough joy to come to church but somewhere somehow they made it to the house of God and they got a little bit of Liberty to break out in the spirit and enjoy the blessings of God I think it's time to break out again in the Holy Ghost until we forget Who's Who and we forget who's here and who's not here and just shout our Sho heels down let a bobby pins go and have church again with the anointing of the vage that Jesus Christ in the midst of his church just let Liberty reain again if you want to shout shout if you want to dance dance if you want to run run if you want to cry cry if you want to sit sit but whatever you do let us be who God called us to [Applause] be now it's our time it's our time we have been waiting to enjoy the Revelation that's been sealed in the book now I'm I'm May shout amen Daniel 12:1 the Bible says time shall Michael stand up and the great Prince would standing for the TR of the people and there shall be a time of trouble such as neb was since there was a nation even to the same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered are y'all ready for this everyone that shall be found written in the book so if there's ever been a time for somebody to shout about the open book now is a time to shout because for years people didn't know who was in that book that would be delivered in the time of trouble but today I'm preaching to a generation who has been sitting under the voice of Malachi th and they have been anointed and endued with the knowledge that their name was in the Lamb's Book of Life from before the foundation of the world they have received the Revelation that they can't no more be lost than God can they have received the Revelation that they can't no more go to hell when God can because they are a Jee seed of the almighty God and that knowledge has come into their heart and they're not a bunch of emotional Christians come on they won't talk about Bubble dancing let's talk about Bubble dancing we ain't bubble dancing we got a foundation to dance home and the foundation we're dancing on is I saw another Mighty Angel come down and he was clo with a cloud and a rainbow was over his head and he had in his hand a little book and I handed that book to the seventh angel and he tore off the seed and reveal the Redemption role come on church if anybody got a right to Rejoice it's the people who has received the knowledge that their name is in the role for deliverance in the time of [Applause] trouble for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret place of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a rock what is a rock in the Bible Revelation Psalm 37:39 but the salvation of the righteousness of the Lord he is their strength in the time of trouble buts in the midst of a great time of trouble that's when Jesus comes in expectation 1958 he said the peoples of all the religion seems to have something within them that calls for someone who has created them to help them in a time of trouble in other words had the book not come open you would not have a thoroughly secure identity of Who You belong to so you could call out but you wouldn't know who you was calling to but since the book has come open the relationship has been restored between the Creator and the creation and now when you cry out you don't cry God you cry Papa God you don't cry God you cry my father are do you hear me because there is a revelation that has endued you to get you through the time of trouble now let me just turn a corner here and say this to the world the time of trouble is scary but to the believer the time of trouble is a special time to the world it's a scary time but to the believer it's a special time you say how can you prove that well Psalms 46:1 says God is our refuge and he is our strength he is a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters therefore Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with a swelling thereof amen s amen can I say this to you young people will you remember this the time of trouble is the time of his presence will you remember that the time of trouble is the time of his presence so when you see trouble remember he's somewhere close by when you find yourself in trouble John remember he's somewhere close by Brother B tells a very beautiful story he said Brother Richard Blair sit here he a friend of his where he was actually working a man helping a man wire a trailer or something and he said while they were wiring this trailer he said they reversed something and however it run the current into water and there was a little boy in there and the man the Traer belonged to was his little boy he was just a little lad and it killed the little boy and his stomach was swollen he said we know electrical shock that's when they died that's what happened see his little eyes set and his teeth went together it alarmed them so bad brother Blair said brother BR said the father walked over there and skinned his fingers am been trying to get the little boy's mouth to break it open they knelt down and started praying over the little boy and he come back to life again so this boy is laying there dead but they went over and begin to pray and he come back to life again and the pro of God said we are living in the divine presence of the great glorious heavenly father Yes when anything happens remember you are the children of the Living God when anything happens remember you are the children of the Living God when anything happens remember you are the children of the Living God and wherever two or three are gathered in my name there I am and again it is written he is a very present help in the time of trouble if there ever was trouble was that little boy laying there dead on the ground from a shock of electricity went through him so we're thanking God this morning with all of our hearts for all these things he's done for us he said in a time of emergency that's the time to look to God and to look to him and be on friendship with him are you hearing me before the emergency of arrives we know this we know this we know this come on generation we know this we have been endued with the knowledge of his presence by the message of the hour we know how to conduct ourselves in the time of trouble we know how to conduct ourselves when emergencies arise we know how to stand and cast out devils and pray for the sick and believe for the impossible and believe prodical are coming home we know how to do it because the the angel has descended with an open book I wish I had a voice of a Thousand Angels right now you are the generation that has been baptized with the Supreme intelligence of the Mighty God deity is not in heaven deity is in this building [Applause] tonight young man don't you ever forget this the mind of Christ is in the bride no matter what happens no matter what turns up the mind of Christ is in this bride she knows what to do with his word don't you ever forget that now you say preacher you're getting way out there well I can't help but getting way out there because I'm living in the time of full restoration brother C it the fourth light or he'll say the last thing I love how he says that this heard him say on tape he said you're seeing the last thing before he comes he said now remember Christ has risen from the dead and is Among Us get that in your mind but remember the last thing is his divine presence let me read this to you Christ raised from the dead and is Among Us somebody say Amen we've seen all kinds of great moves shouting praising God that's all fine we spoke in tongues prophesied all we've seen all that that's fine that comes right along with it but remember the last thing is his divine presence the word itself he is the word the head the word amen is coming to the body he said now it's not some man here is the Messiah it's the holy spirit is the Messiah Christ and the Holy Spirit is the same thing so here it is here now just working in the flesh getting the body ready for the rapturing grace believe it friends believe the knowledge of his presence is preparing you for the translation of your body now how many knows Bram preaches a sermon called The Rapture you familiar with that 1965 he preaches it and he goes and says I'm going to read psalms 27 and he says now psalms 27 is the background for the Rapture most people thought he would read 1 Thessalonians 4 is his open in text or 1 Corinthians 15 but he took psalms 27 and said now it's the background for the Rapture when he preaches that look at this word background it is the setting in which an event takes place so the background brother mcki is the setting of which an event takes place what is a schedule it is to arrange or plan an event to take place at a particular time oh I wish I had some shout room right now are you hearing me the schedule is to arrange for an event to take place at a particular time but the background is the setting that that takes place in and Bam says these words we are facing the greatest event he said I'm here to fulfill the purpose I believe that the Lord Jesus sent me to help do that was to unite the body of Jesus Christ together it's my purpose to do that that's what's in my heart to see all of God's children in one Accord with one heart moving on then I believe when that takes place the work will about be over then the Millennium will sit in the Rapture will come we're certainly praying and watching and waiting for that time for we're looking forward to the greatest event that has ever happened in all human history or ever will it is the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ the son of God to catch a church to himself and to take her to himself even nature itself is calling for that day come on church when you're in church and your pastor's preaching away like a mad man and the Holy Ghost is all over him and you're sitting there like I don't know what's going on in here and he keeps on preaching you know why he's doing that because there's a greater pull on him when you quit amening the trees say Amen when you quit standing up the trees start waving when you say I don't like that the the Seas begin to Roar and the mountains begin to Quake you know why because they're out of their position but there is an adoption on the Church of the Living God come on Young Generation you are that generation that's the adoption word has settled over over your life and has called you to a position of authority in the age of confusion the ackowledge of adoption is in the church tonight by the message of the hour can I say this death has lost its power the grave has lost its spe the grave has lost its power hell is Defeated come on Church Oh Glory to God somebody say I don't know what you're happy about I tell you what I'm happy about is I know who I am I know who called me I know who saved me I know who endued me with this knowledge and I know that if it got me to 27 it'll get me the rest of the way I know it because God has revealed It To My Heart The Rapture somebody say the Rapture the Rapture is the future of the church that knowledge has been endued into you by the message of the hour now that's why we're not tore up about Russia somebody told me the day they said oh you ought to hear our pastor brother wend forgive me okay and somebody told me he said you ought to hear our pastor I said really they said yeah he's in this real good eschatology series I said really he said yeah he said it's real good eschatology said he's in some Baptist preacher I won't call his name but he's fallowing this guy and he's putting all these things together and he's got all these Blood Moons laid out and he said y' he said you're a young man it'll really do something for you you ought to get into it I said uh no offense but has he got any books or tapes do we need to get him a library you say preacher why do you say that because the world has been confused for 2,000 years on how the Rapture is going to take place they had cars wrecking on the highway they had signs and Y2K and this and all this but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall stand in Yuma Arizona and break the re was of the Rapture he would defeat the spirit of confusion and the knowledge of the shouts and the voice and the trumpet would come into the bride by the message of the listen young people we ain't looking for the sky to splits we ain't looking for wrecks on the interstate we're listening for the voice of the Resurrection we're listen for the trumpet we've already got the shout the Revelation has experienced in our lives we are experts on the Rapture that was hard to swallow wasn't it Ronnie we're experts on the rapture we're not a bunch of insignificant kids buried out here in the field in Oklahoma you are experts on the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ by the Revelation get back in the [Applause] message to finish that story that guy ain't even preaching the message now so you see where that leads well preach but and you think I believe I will you're doing a good job budy think I think I'll keep going it's a spirit and you start questioning one area before long you'll be question in every area it'll lead you right out of the power of God so come back under The Voice come on young man you're going to grow up and get married one day and you're going to lead a family what are you going to lead them

power of God and beg to create an atmosphere in their home where the Holy Ghost can welcome in I say we need some young boys that will come back and humble themselves in an age of question mark and come back to the absolutes come back to where right was right and wrong is wrong and death to L his part come back to the message of the hour surrender to it surrender to it all you got to say is I'm

some standards about us where we were not ashamed to say we believe in Holiness now you say preacher you're getting way out there am I really people get in the prison of offense because somebody preaches on those things and then all of a sudden the whole church fills up with you know what amazes me I'm here so I might as well say it what amazes me is you can have a holy ghost filled 85 year old woman in your church for 20 years prays with the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues power of God blesses her power of God anoints her she gets up at the altar and prays for the young girls amen just a real prayer Warrior and she can come there for for 20 years and won't be no girl ever try to be like her but let the Deacon's daughter walk in with a tight skirt and a pair of highill shoes on and

a shield I don't come with a bunch of ss armor but I come in the name of the Lord with a slingshot of faith and a rock of faith and I'm going to sling it at that devil until every devil dies Jonah and the power of God breaks out a Revival and every Young Heart you remember when it used to burn you remember when that Holy Ghost Revival used to burn and then little this got little that got little you know what I say throw it out tonight and let the wind of the Holy ghost begin to blow on the fire again until the power of God Burns I say somebody set the church on fire and invite the world to come

schedule your offenses with his presence you cannot schedule your watered down version of this message with his presence you cannot schedule your diluted views of what brother Ram taught with this message in his presence you got to schedule your faith with his presence then Miracles will take place y'all remember is this okay am I going too long I remember brother BR talked about that woman from the lady the lady from Zion Illinois he said she had a little baby had a club foot right he said they brought it down brother said she bought it in he said she asked me to pray I said sister I need to see a vision she said no brother BR if you'll pray for the baby it'll be okay he said all right I prayed I said the baby's healed go on your way said they walked out said the next day she come back she said brother brandom she said now you said the baby was healed but said his foot is still crippled said now what are we going to do brother BR said she looked at him and said now brother Bram I need you to get a vision he said now hold on sis he said yesterday you didn't need a vision he said what changed between yesterday and today you know what she said she said well brother BR I got one question question for you you tell me is it God's will for my baby to be crippled or not he said sis it's not God's will for your baby to be crippled she said then brother Bram I receive that he said they walked out and he said a few days later I got a call and the baby's legs back normal come down he said now see what happened is we get frustrated that's all but everything's running all right everything's just according to his time he said now watch the only thing for us to do is schedule our faith with his being here and it will happen schedule our faith with his being here and it will happen said see God's always been here in some form he's been here in the form of a light in the form of a man in the form of the son of Jesus Christ he said but he is now here speaking through his church today through the anointed Church of the Living God through the vessels of clay you say preacher why did you take time to clean up the vessels because that is the vessel that God's going to dwell in and God don't live in a filthy house brother said now watch he said we believe the report of Jesus being the Christ the son of God is the truth and we know somebody say we know we know that he promised to be with us in the form of the Holy Spirit Plum to the end of the world to the End of the Age what did Paul tell us in Philippians 2 he said let this mind that was in Christ Jesus be also in you so be endued with the knowledge of Jesus Christ who being in the form of God he thought it not robbery to lay aside the godship and take on the form of a servant remember said now watch he's here today what form the same Jesus in The Bride form the same power the same church the same thing the same word what do you saying brother Andrew I'm saying God never changes his nature he only changes his mask he never changes his nature he only changes his mask now I'm I'm I'm bringing this down to a close but I want to get this to you okay let me say this even though we've already said it Jesus Christ is here in this building tonight Jesus Christ is here in this building tonight he said Christ returning in the form of the word working in human beings and showing the signs he promised it would sign it would do he promised he would do it he is here in the form of a prophetic message now can I can I give you something here for a second how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear shall he speak he will show you thanks to come look at this word come again it is of persons to come from one place to another and used of both persons arriving at the same place 1953 he said now I believe this lady standing here I do not know you do I lady I can can I read this to you I've never seen you as far as I know of we're perfect strangers never seen you in my life then well if I don't know you and probably you raised hundreds and hundreds of miles down here probably and then when come down here to talk to you why he me raised up in Indiana probably you down in Florida so she was raised in Florida he was raised in Indiana well then when we come together to talk one to another we've been miles apart but God knowed since the before you were born he knowed me since before I was born and now I believe you're a Christian because your spirit seems to be welcome when a Christian comes there's just something that just welcomes see I get that right away it's a holy spirit but now if me knowing nothing of you and miles apart all of our life the Holy Spirit would have to do something that would make you know that the presence of his being is here then it would make you have more confidence that I told you the truth Church of the Living God then the presence of the Lord is coming into the church and is giving you Faith to believe the words you're hearing and is end doing you with a knowledge of his presence that you cannot hide nothing from him now I'm closing on this the holy spirit moves out on the building and speaks to whomever he will speak see that's Sovereign and then that brings the knowledge because it's a promise of God and that brings the knowledge of God's Sovereign and also brings his presence down among us we should see it and rejoice we should see it and rejoice he said you say well I was crippled in my hand I was there last night I didn't get any better that don't have nothing to do with it to you it's already f finished you're not looking at your hand then you're looking at the promise and therefore you can't say well brother so and so didn't pray the prayer of faith or so and so it's the presence of the Lord that gave you the faith you see that he sent his word and healed them listen we believe he sent his word and healed I believe tonight he sent his word and delivered young boys I believe he sent his word and delivered young girls come on church I believe the word does the work he sent his word brother Bryce he sent his word he sent his word amen and sister Stephanie was healed of those migraines he sent his word brother B set in his office last Wednesday and told me brother Andrew she's not feeling well but ever since God moved for her with the migraines she's never had another one since are y'all hearing me are you hearing me I'm talking about the word coming in the church and cleaning out the church and making
