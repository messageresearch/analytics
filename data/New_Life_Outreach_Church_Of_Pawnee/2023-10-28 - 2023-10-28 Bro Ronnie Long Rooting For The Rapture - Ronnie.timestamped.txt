[39:09] you in the mighty name of Jesus
[39:11] Christ amen and amen if you have your
[39:15] Bibles we'll turn to the book of St John
[39:18] the first
[39:19] chapter the
[39:22] Lord
[39:25] amen praise the
[39:29] Lord the Brandon would say we're not
[39:32] just come together to talk about the
[39:34] message yeah we are come together to get
[39:37] in the message all right and I'm
[39:38] thankful for that that we're not just
[39:40] here to talk about something but we're
[39:41] here to get into something he says that
[39:44] message is Christ he is the word and
[39:46] we're to get into it get beneath it now
[39:50] that's that's a commission for us not
[39:52] just to get associated with it but to
[39:54] get beneath it which means it's our
[39:56] headship
[39:57] it's our it's our lordship it's our
[39:59] everything to get beneath this word amen
[40:01] the Bible would say in the beginning was
[40:03] the word and the Word was with God and
[40:04] the Word was God the same was in the
[40:07] beginning with God and all things were
[40:08] made by him and without him was not
[40:11] anything made that was made and in him
[40:13] was life and the life was the light of
[40:15] men and the light shineth in darkness
[40:17] and the Darkness comprehended it not
[40:19] yeah and the 12th verse would say but as
[40:21] many as received him to them gave he
[40:25] power to become I that's a powerful
[40:28] phrase power to become the sons of God
[40:32] even to them that believe on his name
[40:34] which were born not of blood nor of the
[40:36] will of the flesh nor of the will of man
[40:38] but of God and the Word was made flesh
[40:40] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[40:42] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[40:45] of the father full of grace and truth
[40:48] amen may God bless his word tonight you
[40:50] may be seated so we just want to for a
[40:52] few minutes we don't to take a lot of
[40:53] your time tonight but we're going to
[40:55] speak on rooting for a Rapture right I
[40:58] believe we're rooting for a Rapture and
[40:59] this scripture would tell us that
[41:01] there's there's something taking place
[41:03] here that John's trying to describe to
[41:05] us and he's he's Penning this down but
[41:07] it was very precise it sounds much like
[41:09] Moses's Penning right in the beginning
[41:12] was God right in the beginning so
[41:15] there's some conversation they're having
[41:17] with another another another Force other
[41:19] than themselves that's telling them what
[41:21] has gone on before their time and so
[41:24] John is is writing this this not just to
[41:26] not just to be different than the other
[41:28] gospels but he's got a revelation of
[41:30] something he's got something in mind
[41:32] here when he's writing this down and if
[41:34] you go back and you look in your in your
[41:35] history you'll find brother William that
[41:37] I'm sure you know this that John
[41:38] actually wrote this book after he was
[41:41] caught up on the aisle of Patmos so John
[41:43] is writing this from a revelated
[41:45] position he's not writing this from just
[41:47] a level where everybody else is at but
[41:49] he's been caught up in a higher realm in
[41:51] Heavenly places in Christ so he comes
[41:53] back to write this to us to tell us
[41:55] something the word that was in the
[41:57] beginning is the word in the middle will
[41:59] be the word at the end the same word in
[42:01] every way it will do the same thing by
[42:03] the same Power by the same
[42:05] manifestations it won't change a bit but
[42:07] the word in the beginning will be the
[42:09] same word at the end and that word was
[42:11] made flesh and dwelt Among Us right so
[42:13] that word became Christ and it was
[42:15] dwelling amongst them and it was shaking
[42:17] hands and it was fellowshipping with
[42:19] them and then that word uh uh moved on
[42:21] and had had dinner with them and it had
[42:23] broke bread with them and then thist RT
[42:26] didn't expire brother Miguel when Jesus
[42:28] went went up off the scene but the word
[42:31] is still made flesh in this day the word
[42:33] is still to be made flesh in this hour
[42:35] and in this time so he's looking for
[42:38] somebody and he's given us the power to
[42:40] become this word is that what the
[42:42] scripture says he gave them power to
[42:44] become the sons of God so I thank God
[42:47] it's not about my skill or my strength
[42:49] or my ability but he gave us power to
[42:52] become the very word in the same way in
[42:54] every way not a little a little bit
[42:56] different not not a little bit weaker
[42:58] down or watered down but the same in
[43:00] every way that he was you shall also be
[43:03] I think that's a Great Commission to the
[43:05] church in this hour that we're not going
[43:06] to settle for anything less than the
[43:08] same right somebody say same brother the
[43:11] BR was say it like this but you remember
[43:13] when it went down the grain begin to
[43:15] ripen and you find that the grain before
[43:17] that grain can ripen everything in that
[43:19] stock has to be dead so can't you see
[43:22] where you're standing life is in the
[43:24] grain again just exactly like the same
[43:26] grain that went in the ground the same
[43:28] Jesus in The Bride form same power same
[43:31] church same things same word the same
[43:35] word sucked up through these and come
[43:36] out here and come to aead here and all
[43:39] that life come through there picked up
[43:41] its people and now is forming into a
[43:43] head for the Rapture so he's saying that
[43:46] all the life through all the ages has
[43:48] funneled through time and funneled
[43:49] through this age and that age to come
[43:51] forward to a finishing cycle and I
[43:54] believe that's where we're living right
[43:55] now and I brother brother wendle was
[43:56] just mentioning it you don't have to
[43:57] look far to see that the world is
[43:59] shaking and that the times are at hand
[44:01] and I you know brother Wendell I I I
[44:03] think if I was a message critic I'd be
[44:05] real uh scratching my head right now a
[44:07] little bit shaking in my boots because
[44:09] everything is playing out just exactly
[44:11] as we were this is no surprise to us but
[44:13] we were expecting this day to come and
[44:15] it should it should it should Quicken us
[44:17] to realize the hour is at hand the the
[44:19] hour is come and is now is that he is
[44:22] going to fulfill his word and so if he's
[44:24] fulfilling that part of his word
[44:26] he's also going to fulfill this part of
[44:28] his word if we see Israel being
[44:29] fulfilled in her time then the bride
[44:31] will also be fulfilled in this time so
[44:34] we see all of the the world shaking and
[44:36] groaning and crying but all of that is
[44:38] focused on the manifestation of the sons
[44:41] of God so if that is taking place then
[44:43] this is also taking place and it's not
[44:45] just one church spearheading this or one
[44:48] pastor spearheading this but it's a
[44:50] global bride movement that we're moving
[44:52] into a Rapture Ready body that we're
[44:55] we're tired of the day to day I don't
[44:56] have to pass the mic around and know
[44:58] Miguel are you tired of going to work
[45:00] yes because we're tired of the day to
[45:02] day and the in and- out and brother John
[45:04] you're tired of going back to the same
[45:06] job and we're ready to Rapture out of
[45:08] here it's not because we're lazy or we
[45:11] don't want to go to work but this is not
[45:12] our home this is not where we belong we
[45:15] shouldn't fit in here we shouldn't feel
[45:17] comfortable here but we were not called
[45:18] to fit in here we were called to take a
[45:21] body change and we will never be
[45:23] comfortable until this body takes a
[45:26] change and there's another body waiting
[45:28] there that's why you don't even feel
[45:29] comfortable in your own skin sometimes
[45:31] cuz it's not really your body there's
[45:33] another one waiting for you I go to
[45:36] prepare a place for you right that body
[45:38] is just a few feet away already prepared
[45:41] specifically for you so that's why you
[45:43] don't fit in here that's why you don't
[45:45] feel comfortable here we shouldn't feel
[45:46] comfortable in leoa we should be ready
[45:49] for a Rapture and I believe we're ready
[45:51] to lay everything aside can I get an
[45:53] agreement we're ready to lay everything
[45:55] aside and say enough I I I I don't want
[45:57] to I don't want to settle for another
[45:59] year of this I say even so come Lord
[46:02] Jesus and we got different age groups in
[46:04] here and young men let me tell you your
[46:06] days are allotted by the Lord so as long
[46:08] as you're in the perfect will of God
[46:10] whatever days you have are the days in
[46:12] God's mind and old people alike whatever
[46:13] days you have are the days in God's
[46:16] mind so why would we want to continue on
[46:20] outside of what God's already prepared
[46:22] for us but he's prepared a place for us
[46:25] and we've had enough of the world we've
[46:28] had enough of trying to keep the faith
[46:30] and you had a victory and you wonder how
[46:31] long am I going to keep this Victory
[46:33] before I fall off this mountain again
[46:34] but there's coming a time when you rise
[46:37] up in Victory and you won't have to go
[46:39] back down in defeat again but it will be
[46:41] the final overthrow of your enemy and I
[46:44] believe we're stepping into that realm
[46:46] we're stepping to that time where we're
[46:48] saying enough with the world we're
[46:49] moving on I'm Not Looking Back lot Lot's
[46:54] wife is not my type
[46:56] that's why it's not comfortable May
[46:57] that's a lot of times why a lot of us
[46:59] don't find great success in this world
[47:01] because we're not meant to be
[47:02] comfortable here we're meant to have
[47:04] success in the word of God and until we
[47:06] get into that Groove into that sequence
[47:09] of Life It'll be such a struggle for us
[47:11] but if we will let go of our worldly
[47:13] desires and our worldly Ambitions and
[47:15] say I want to line up with the word of
[47:17] God there's a peace that passes all
[47:20] understanding if we have to drink Branch
[47:22] water and eat soda crackers we're lined
[47:24] up with the word of God
[47:26] and that's what makes the difference in
[47:27] our life I believe I'm speaking to a
[47:29] group of people that know that we're
[47:31] tired of the
[47:32] world I don't want to be here next year
[47:35] I don't want to be here in the coming
[47:37] years and we're you know the holidays
[47:38] are coming up and people make PL I don't
[47:40] want to be here for those come on if I'm
[47:42] here we'll have a good time and we'll
[47:43] eat but I don't want to be here for
[47:45] those I've got another body that's
[47:47] pulling on me I've got another place a
[47:50] mansion already prepared that's calling
[47:52] me to come up higher and and I don't
[47:54] have to deal with this anymore more you
[47:56] know we don't have to deal with what the
[47:57] devil gives us in life I think that's a
[48:00] lie the devil's put over the church for
[48:02] too many years we don't have to just
[48:03] deal with the complexes and the and the
[48:06] issues and the anxieties and the
[48:08] temperaments there's another place for
[48:10] us a body prepared and Christ doesn't do
[48:13] work like some contractors do work his
[48:16] work is
[48:17] perfect without
[48:19] flaw brother BR said it's the same right
[48:23] remember that word same same that's what
[48:25] the church is doing today for Jesus is
[48:28] the word and he is the bridegroom and
[48:29] the Bride is a part of the groom
[48:31] therefore the word that is to be
[48:33] fulfilled this day is the same part of
[48:35] the word that was fulfilled in his day
[48:38] it's the same word same experience same
[48:43] life got it Caleb same say same same and
[48:48] so spiritual weak can lay before the so
[48:50] n to be turned to a golden grain of the
[48:52] word see made word God made flesh
[48:54] Vindicated he that believeth on me the
[48:56] works that I do shall he also the church
[48:58] that lives by that word ripening not
[49:00] through organization but in the presence
[49:03] of the word the sun it becomes what the
[49:06] very same word that went down on the day
[49:09] of Pentecost yeah now doesn't Malachi 4
[49:12] teach us that before the the great and
[49:14] terrible day of the Lord shall come that
[49:16] this will take place how many knows that
[49:18] and he will restore the hearts of the
[49:19] children to the fathers is that right
[49:22] the faith of the original Pentecostal
[49:24] fathers and in that day I Luke 17 uh
[49:26] Jesus said when the son of man is being
[49:28] revealed not men the son of man not an
[49:32] organization the son of man the word
[49:35] living itself again among the peopleall
[49:38] the word itself made flesh in you now
[49:41] this is a challenging statement brother
[49:43] William you are a reflection of this
[49:46] hour the message amen you are a
[49:49] reflection of it see you live again live
[49:52] the life that was in Jesus Christ and
[49:54] you're in the presence of the the son
[49:56] you're a reflection of this amen that's
[49:58] right he's he's called you to to a
[50:01] position to be the reflection of him in
[50:03] this age now I believe we're all in here
[50:05] tonight because we didn't have anything
[50:06] better to do and we we certainly could
[50:08] be somewhere else and we could be doing
[50:09] something else but we came here because
[50:11] we love the Lord Jesus right and we want
[50:13] to receive something from him so if
[50:14] we're going to if we're going to love
[50:16] him with all our heart I would think we
[50:17] want to represent him the best way that
[50:20] we could right we want to be the same as
[50:22] he is in action and in deed and in word
[50:24] and not from that but we've been given
[50:27] authority to have the same power that he
[50:30] had so why would we settle service in
[50:34] and service out for anything less than
[50:36] the same and I I wonder tonight how
[50:38] different our our position would be if
[50:40] the literal Lord Jesus in his body was
[50:42] standing here and he was taking requests
[50:45] tonight what would we bring to his
[50:46] request what what would we bring to his
[50:48] feet and ask him for but he's the same
[50:51] tonight we don't need him in a literal
[50:53] body we have him in his word body we
[50:56] have the same Authority tonight if we
[50:58] recognize it's the same power within us
[51:01] by the same experience by the same life
[51:04] right we in agreement tonight
[51:06] amen amen so there's a requirement for
[51:09] us to be the reflection of the message I
[51:12] like that that hook just stands out I
[51:13] have to look for it or tosses just right
[51:16] there good job whoever did that so you
[51:19] see he has cut wants to cut the church
[51:22] out just like he did the Sun out yeah
[51:25] like he did the bride in the groom you
[51:26] see he's talking about a pattern right
[51:28] they're they're both virgins yeah but
[51:30] one's wise and it's cut out of the
[51:32] pattern and it's in the bride group
[51:34] right that is the bride that he's cut
[51:36] out of that pattern to be his bride you
[51:38] must be part of him not part of the
[51:40] Creed not part of the church not part of
[51:42] the denomination but the part of him
[51:45] hewed out from any other kind of form
[51:47] won't work you got to be hewed from the
[51:49] word the world cut off of you just leave
[51:52] the world only live in you the great
[51:54] sculpt is counting on you willing to
[51:58] stand and have yourself shaped into the
[52:00] likeness of his requirement that his
[52:02] word requires in the last day I'll pour
[52:05] out my spirit upon All Flesh and your
[52:06] sons and daughters shall prophesy Christ
[52:08] is the identified Masterpiece of the
[52:10] word made flesh and you are asked to
[52:13] identify yourself in him by the same
[52:16] word to be the Masterpiece for the bride
[52:19] now Brethren God has a ma had a
[52:21] masterpiece then to present to the world
[52:23] and now he wants a masterpiece today he
[52:26] would say are you
[52:28] willing are you ready my Christian
[52:31] friend are you ready to be the fullness
[52:33] of the word now I I I I if I could just
[52:37] bear my heart here for a minute we
[52:38] started on quotes like this of the
[52:40] original pattern and the original Church
[52:42] going back to Pentecost and immediately
[52:44] there's an identification that takes
[52:45] place of the direction of the sermon but
[52:48] I'm not afraid to quote a quote I'm not
[52:50] afraid to quote what brother brandom
[52:51] said about it in fear that I might be
[52:53] labeled or I might be cast this group or
[52:55] cast than that group but I think we want
[52:57] all the word right we've had enough of
[52:59] just part of the word or this direction
[53:01] of the word but the bride will be hungry
[53:03] for all the word and she will say only
[53:05] what he said in all of what he said and
[53:08] I think it's very important that we
[53:09] maintain the Same Spirit as how he said
[53:12] it and brother Mitch I could take these
[53:14] quotes and I could use a quote against
[53:16] you and make you think that you'll never
[53:18] obtain rapturing Grace you'll never get
[53:20] it by misconstruing what the prophet
[53:22] said but I'm not saying it in the spirit
[53:24] that he Ed it in and for years I I I was
[53:28] born into a message realm and a message
[53:30] church and I grew up in thinking this
[53:31] direction but then you start to get
[53:33] Revelation you realize that's not what
[53:34] he meant at all but that was
[53:35] misrepresented or that was mishandled
[53:37] and so by that we have different
[53:39] different forms in our mind that if
[53:41] someone were to bring a quote to us
[53:42] immediately within us we're thinking
[53:44] he's going this direction and so we've
[53:46] already preconceived this in our mind by
[53:48] somewhere where we've been we've been
[53:50] mishandled with that bit of word is that
[53:53] all right am I
[53:54] okay we've been we we've been mislabeled
[53:57] right we already have a label over us
[53:59] and you know there when I moved to
[54:02] brother brother uh brother Wayne sends
[54:03] his greetings by the way but when I
[54:04] moved up there to that church it was
[54:06] labeled the Amish Pentecostal church I
[54:09] thought good Lord what am I getting into
[54:10] going to this church it's Amish
[54:11] Pentecostal I found out just Believers I
[54:14] found out it was just a bunch of
[54:15] Believers like I was but they had a
[54:16] label over them and if I wasn't able to
[54:18] look past the label I might not ever
[54:20] walked in the door but then come to find
[54:22] out it's just wonderful good people that
[54:24] love the word yeah but you see how a
[54:26] label would have scared me away from
[54:28] coming into that church because it's
[54:30] denomination and denomination an Amish
[54:32] Pentecostal Church well I don't want
[54:35] anything to do with a double
[54:35] denomination church but then you go
[54:37] there and you find out oh the word's
[54:38] being preached and it's being received
[54:39] and just because they have some
[54:41] excitement about them they're labeled
[54:42] Pentecostal you see how easy a label
[54:44] takes
[54:46] place we find that when this message
[54:49] this message was first preached and and
[54:51] the prophet was on the scene and he was
[54:52] preaching it and there was there was
[54:54] hordes of people people that would come
[54:55] but they weren't really there for the
[54:56] word they were there for the healing and
[54:59] they were there for the blessing and
[55:00] they were there for the for the angel in
[55:02] the room and they were there but some of
[55:03] them were grasping the word right
[55:05] because God will always have a seed it's
[55:07] like brother Brandon would preach the
[55:08] message I think it was after he got done
[55:10] preaching future home and he gets in the
[55:11] car with brother Billy and he says Billy
[55:13] did you understand what I preached
[55:14] tonight said yeah Daddy yeah yeah he
[55:17] said did you
[55:19] really understand what I preach tonight
[55:21] and he said at that moment I realized I
[55:23] didn't understand what he had preached
[55:24] tonight
[55:26] he said ' no I I I guess I didn't daddy
[55:28] and he said yeah I doubt whether five
[55:30] people in that group understood what I
[55:33] was preaching tonight questions and
[55:35] answers on the seals he'll say this
[55:37] isn't for you don't worry about it don't
[55:40] stress about it but there's a people
[55:41] coming all right so you see in that time
[55:44] he was preaching this message but it was
[55:46] a seed laying down there was a seed
[55:48] coming forth and at the appointed time
[55:50] that seed would come up through a bride
[55:52] body that would understand what he was
[55:54] preaching about they would understand a
[55:56] future home they would understand the
[55:57] seven seal they would understand these
[55:59] things but you see how men got involved
[56:01] in the message was by uh a lack of a
[56:04] lack of resource if I could say it like
[56:07] that it wasn't that they were bad men or
[56:10] they had they had uh bad ideas I'll give
[56:12] them Grace and say that they weren't
[56:13] trying to build their own kingdom but
[56:15] they only had a limited resource so
[56:18] brother bram's taking off the scene and
[56:19] there's just a few tapes right there's
[56:21] just a they don't even have all the
[56:22] messages uh finished and and unreal a
[56:25] real and I remember I spoke to a sister
[56:26] in Indiana some months ago and she was
[56:28] just maybe 12 or 13 years old when she
[56:30] was going to brother Bam's meetings and
[56:31] she said she remember when he went out
[56:33] the scene and they would have church in
[56:34] their living room and they would play a
[56:35] real toore and she said they had to wait
[56:37] because you didn't have money to buy a
[56:38] whole set of real to reals and they
[56:40] didn't have them ready anyway so you'd
[56:41] you'd have a real toore and you'd mail
[56:43] it back and then they'd re-record on it
[56:45] and they'd mail it back to you but the
[56:47] John imagine being a preacher and having
[56:49] to rely on a on maybe a real toore
[56:51] coming in every 2 three months and so
[56:53] you're just hammering down on that real
[56:54] toore then you have to send it off and
[56:55] wait till one comes back and even at
[56:57] that you only have a couple hundred
[56:59] recorded messages right we're in the
[57:01] late 60s now maybe early
[57:03] 70s and they just have limited
[57:06] resources but they made
[57:09] it right they didn't have uh the 1200
[57:12] messages we have but they made it and
[57:15] they continued on in the faith and then
[57:17] they move into it and you got tapes
[57:18] coming out and then you got you got you
[57:20] know this sister it was pretty it was
[57:21] pretty interesting she told me she sent
[57:22] off a real toore and one came back and
[57:25] it had a brother's name on it she just
[57:26] remembered the name something struck
[57:28] within there I remember this brother's
[57:29] name and just a few years later that
[57:31] would be her husband and it was his name
[57:33] on the real toore that she got into her
[57:34] house you see God's got it all in
[57:36] control he knows where everybody's at
[57:38] and where everybody's going to come
[57:39] together in every Junction and he's got
[57:41] a spouse for everybody if we could just
[57:43] line up with the word of God it'll
[57:45] happen he knows where everybody's at
[57:49] right so she she said it was it was like
[57:52] it was like like like w something like
[57:55] wanting a burger but there being no
[57:56] burger place in town but she knew it was
[57:59] out there she knew there was more word
[58:02] but it was just not accessible yeah
[58:04] right so you see how how how then a a
[58:07] real toore would come into a church and
[58:09] then that man would take that real to
[58:10] real and he would preach it to the
[58:12] people from his
[58:14] filter I hope this is okay he would
[58:17] preach it from his filter and so not
[58:19] everybody had a real toore player not
[58:22] everybody had access to the tape library
[58:24] but what happen is is a man would take a
[58:26] a tape and he would preach that tape but
[58:28] it was always through that man's filter
[58:30] not that he was a bad man but it was a
[58:31] limited resource of Revelation and so
[58:34] you couldn't tie these loose ends
[58:35] together because you didn't have the
[58:37] whole package right you didn't have all
[58:39] the messages you didn't have all the uh
[58:41] you know the sheveport series tying with
[58:43] adoption you didn't have those things
[58:45] together at the same time you had all
[58:46] these and I remember my dad uh when I
[58:49] was young it was all about books you
[58:50] just had the books and not everybody
[58:51] even had a whole tape library but
[58:53] everybody had a book library right and I
[58:55] remember he had a he had a a whole set
[58:57] of red volumes and it was like the
[58:59] coveted shelf you know and he would
[59:00] always go to that red volume preach out
[59:02] the red volumes they had red duct tape
[59:04] all over them and he'd have those things
[59:05] just Pages falling out he'd preach out
[59:07] of that and then one day one of his red
[59:09] volumes went missing and I remember just
[59:12] being like a total loss you know what
[59:15] are we going to
[59:16] do and he tried to you know find it
[59:18] tried to find it dig it up look at the
[59:19] church ask the church does anybody SE my
[59:21] red volume no went on a couple years and
[59:25] we uh we we go somewhere to another
[59:27] church and he's in that Pastor
[59:30] study and he's got a set of red volumes
[59:33] say oh I've been looking for a couple
[59:35] quotes out of my volume three you know
[59:37] and pulls it down and opens it up and he
[59:39] says that looks like my
[59:43] handwriting said man this guy made notes
[59:46] exactly the same as I made notes he
[59:49] thought no surely not and he flips to
[59:50] the back of the book and sure enough the
[59:52] guy's name is in the back of the book
[59:55] man this is interesting it flips back
[59:57] and just looks for another quote this is
[59:59] my handwriting I made this note right
[1:00:02] here and goes to the back of the book
[1:00:04] and and there's a little curl on the
[1:00:06] label and rips off the label and sure
[1:00:08] enough his name is underneath that
[1:00:14] label I it got pretty weird in the
[1:00:16] office I
[1:00:17] bet oh I don't know how that got there
[1:00:20] but you see if we stop at the label of
[1:00:22] what Satan puts in front of the surpris
[1:00:25] we'll never really see what's there
[1:00:27] we'll never really see the reality of
[1:00:29] what's meant for us but we we are coming
[1:00:31] to a place where we're ready to tear off
[1:00:32] the label you can label me Pentecostal
[1:00:35] you can label me perua you can label me
[1:00:37] Thunders you can label me whatever you
[1:00:38] want to but I'm going to stay with the
[1:00:40] word I'm going to stay with the word and
[1:00:43] I don't care what you label it I don't
[1:00:44] care what you call it I don't care what
[1:00:46] you think I'm not really interested in
[1:00:48] your opinion I'm interested in what the
[1:00:50] word says and as for me I'll stay with
[1:00:53] the word I will like to believe that the
[1:00:55] Lord spoke to that brother and that
[1:00:57] brother and that brother about their
[1:00:58] Revelation but as for me I'll stay with
[1:01:01] the word the B said maybe that brother
[1:01:03] just misunderstood but I have an
[1:01:05] obligation to stay with the word because
[1:01:08] it's the same and we will not make it
[1:01:10] outside the same in every way it's got
[1:01:14] to be the same he says how can two walk
[1:01:17] together except they be agreed how can
[1:01:20] you do it you can't but on the day of
[1:01:22] Pentecost what made the Holy Spirit come
[1:01:26] they was in one Accord if you ever asked
[1:01:29] yourself that question what caused the
[1:01:31] Holy Spirit to come into that upper room
[1:01:33] they was in one Accord and that's what
[1:01:36] made the Holy Spirit Come and now what
[1:01:39] they was that's the way we ought to be
[1:01:41] now and then the Holy Spirit can come
[1:01:44] upon us right amen he says thus what the
[1:01:49] church was at Pentecost is the standard
[1:01:51] somebody say standard stand that is the
[1:01:54] pattern there is no other pattern no
[1:01:56] matter what the scholars say God has not
[1:01:59] changed that pattern what God did at
[1:02:01] Pentecost he has to keep doing on doing
[1:02:04] until the church age
[1:02:06] closes so you can label me what you want
[1:02:09] to label me but I'll stay with the word
[1:02:11] right but what's happened is through
[1:02:13] this limited resource and this limited
[1:02:15] knowledge a man would obtain this tape
[1:02:17] and he would preach it through his
[1:02:18] filter and then you end up with
[1:02:19] divisions and fissures and separations
[1:02:22] and you've got this guy's only got this
[1:02:23] set of tapes so he's going to preach it
[1:02:25] from this angle and the people do not
[1:02:27] have access at this point to all the
[1:02:29] word I remember when you had to look up
[1:02:31] a quote brother Miguel you had to go you
[1:02:33] had to wait till you found somebody with
[1:02:34] a computer that had the table on there
[1:02:36] and you would go try to search that
[1:02:37] quote out until then you had a whole
[1:02:38] list of quotes you were trying to look
[1:02:40] up but now we've got no
[1:02:44] excuse this is open app come on it's
[1:02:47] free you can download it for free and
[1:02:50] you have the entire message in the palm
[1:02:53] of your hands you got no excuse and by
[1:02:56] that God science thinks that they've
[1:02:58] tapped into this resource by their
[1:02:59] intellect but God has allowed them to
[1:03:01] tap into this so that he might use it to
[1:03:03] get the word to you and to you and to
[1:03:05] you and to you without another filter
[1:03:07] but by your own filter of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:10] and it comes forward and now when the
[1:03:11] man of God behind the pulpit Rings a
[1:03:13] certain sound you can say Amen to the
[1:03:16] word because it's coming through the
[1:03:17] same filter that you already have
[1:03:19] received the word and you recognize it
[1:03:21] as God using his word to activate
[1:03:24] something in your
[1:03:25] life right so you see how how man would
[1:03:28] get in here and put labels on things and
[1:03:30] then men would be afraid to use certain
[1:03:32] quotes or they' be afraid to go a
[1:03:34] certain direction as fear that they
[1:03:36] might lose a friendship or they might
[1:03:37] lose and this happened I mean I I know
[1:03:39] what I'm talking about personally you
[1:03:40] lose relationships and and you lose
[1:03:43] because you preach a certain direction
[1:03:44] and that person has labeled that
[1:03:45] direction as this and see so you end up
[1:03:49] with just a separation happening and
[1:03:51] many of us young ones were born into
[1:03:53] something we had no idea what was going
[1:03:55] on why don't we fellowship with that
[1:03:57] church or why isn't there fellowship
[1:03:58] with this group over here why isn't
[1:03:59] there this because 35 years
[1:04:03] ago somebody preached something that
[1:04:05] didn't agree with this or didn't agree
[1:04:07] with that and there was a separation
[1:04:08] that took place and see everybody over
[1:04:11] there they're all emotional and they're
[1:04:12] all this and they're that and they're
[1:04:14] they're the Thunders group and then you
[1:04:15] have the other group over here that's
[1:04:16] the perua group and they they can't say
[1:04:18] Amen they can't cry they can't move in
[1:04:20] their Pew and then this group over here
[1:04:21] just stands up and shouts you can't even
[1:04:22] hear the preacher speaking and then you
[1:04:24] have a return Ministry group and you
[1:04:26] have this group and you see what happens
[1:04:28] man got
[1:04:29] involved and anywhere you have man
[1:04:32] involved you're gon to it's not going to
[1:04:34] line up you're G to have issues come so
[1:04:38] why I asked myself this question why was
[1:04:42] the church at Pentecost the
[1:04:45] pattern why was it God's pattern for the
[1:04:47] perfect church was it because they could
[1:04:49] speak in
[1:04:52] tongues was it because they had signs
[1:04:54] and
[1:04:55] wonders why were they called the pattern
[1:04:58] of the true church brother BR would say
[1:05:01] until he stops calling the Pentecostal
[1:05:03] message and power will not cease what
[1:05:05] the church had at Pentecost is her
[1:05:07] aailable right originally she had the
[1:05:09] pure word of God she had the power of
[1:05:11] the spirit manifested in diverse signs
[1:05:13] and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:17] the original church was not organized by
[1:05:21] men somebody remember that not organized
[1:05:25] by men it was led by the Holy Ghost it
[1:05:28] wasn't very big it was hated and
[1:05:30] despised it was oppressed it was
[1:05:31] persecuted unto death but it was true to
[1:05:34] God and it stayed with the original word
[1:05:37] pattern now just to clear something up
[1:05:39] I'm not talking about isusa street I'm
[1:05:41] talking about the original church at
[1:05:42] Pentecost I I have no desire to go
[1:05:44] backwards in this plan of God I'm not
[1:05:46] trying to go back to something that we
[1:05:47] already came from but he said come out
[1:05:49] of her and be not partakers of her so
[1:05:51] we're not interested in going back to a
[1:05:53] denomination thought where where by it's
[1:05:55] by emotion or by the initial evidence or
[1:05:57] by this or that we only want the word
[1:05:59] and I'm tired of just having half a
[1:06:01] quote and half a quote and not being
[1:06:03] able to tie those quotes together but as
[1:06:05] the end time bride we're ready for that
[1:06:06] to dob tail together where this fits
[1:06:08] that and that fits that and we're ready
[1:06:10] to go on with the whole word I don't
[1:06:12] want just half the word or this opinion
[1:06:15] or you know I believe the devil has used
[1:06:17] limited resource to stumble the bride
[1:06:19] for too many years but we've got no
[1:06:21] excuse left we have the opening of the
[1:06:24] the word we have an open resource we
[1:06:26] have a revelated Ministry preaching this
[1:06:28] in this age it's on us to line up with
[1:06:31] the
[1:06:32] word you know the devil has used
[1:06:35] religious Spirits at the back door of a
[1:06:36] church to stumble more Christians than
[1:06:39] alcohol or cigarettes or anything else a
[1:06:42] religious spirit standing there with a
[1:06:43] tap measure and no Grace and law and law
[1:06:46] and law and law and law and I personally
[1:06:48] I know people that will never darken the
[1:06:50] door of a church again lest God do
[1:06:51] something miraculous in their life
[1:06:53] because because of a religious spirit
[1:06:55] that didn't understand the fullness of
[1:06:57] the word but I'm not interested in that
[1:07:01] opinion you shouldn't be interested in
[1:07:03] my opinion don't just take what I'm
[1:07:05] saying for it don't just take what
[1:07:06] brother Wendell's saying don't just take
[1:07:08] what brother Josh is saying but take
[1:07:10] what the word says about it and when he
[1:07:12] preaches the word you know it lines up
[1:07:14] and you get in the groove and say amen
[1:07:17] that's what's calling me that's what's
[1:07:19] Rising me higher I don't want a man's
[1:07:21] opinion I want the whole word
[1:07:24] the same experience with the same
[1:07:26] demonstration right so why was it the
[1:07:29] original
[1:07:30] pattern they were gathered in the upper
[1:07:33] room in one
[1:07:36] Accord in one mind now whose mind was it
[1:07:41] this church was not organized by men
[1:07:44] there was not a great Bishop among them
[1:07:45] that rose up and said you guys have to
[1:07:47] line up with my idea but it was led by
[1:07:49] the Holy Spirit and they had to gather
[1:07:52] together in that Upper Room to do do
[1:07:54] something that we must do tonight get
[1:07:56] rid of our own idea get rid of our own
[1:07:59] thought get rid of our own pet Doctrine
[1:08:00] get rid of our own agenda get rid of our
[1:08:02] own Direction and come into the
[1:08:04] surrender of the word and say everything
[1:08:06] else is gone I don't want anything else
[1:08:08] I I don't want to attach to anything
[1:08:10] else but I only want what the word says
[1:08:13] about me all right so they spent 10 days
[1:08:16] in an upper room wasn't very big I used
[1:08:19] to know the exact dimensions but I I
[1:08:21] don't think brother William it was much
[1:08:22] bigger than probably just a section of
[1:08:24] pews here not much bigger than that for
[1:08:26] 120
[1:08:28] people that's pretty tight space these
[1:08:31] 120 people were called GA in that Upper
[1:08:34] Room
[1:08:35] why it was a commission right he said
[1:08:38] Terry there and Jerusalem and wait until
[1:08:41] you're endued with this power that he's
[1:08:43] talking about in John 1 power to become
[1:08:46] the sons of
[1:08:47] God so here's where we enter into our
[1:08:49] thought for a minute
[1:08:52] here what did they do knew that was so
[1:08:55] pleasing that God himself would come and
[1:08:58] break himself up and pour himself into
[1:09:01] every vessel in that
[1:09:03] room they got rid of their
[1:09:06] Humanity they got rid of their own
[1:09:08] thoughts they got rid of opinions they
[1:09:10] got rid of they got rid of uh ideas
[1:09:12] about one another now these 120 people
[1:09:15] already went to church with each
[1:09:16] other they rubbed shoulders with each
[1:09:18] other they hunted they were Hunting
[1:09:20] Buddies they were fishing buddies they
[1:09:21] they hung out with each other they had
[1:09:23] competition with each other they they
[1:09:26] they they they ate supper with each
[1:09:27] other they prayed together they worked
[1:09:30] together and then they're shoved in a
[1:09:32] room together that's why it's easy for a
[1:09:35] cyber Church to maintain a large
[1:09:36] membership with 1500 1800 members
[1:09:39] because they don't have to fellowship
[1:09:40] with one another they don't have to get
[1:09:41] along with one another they could just
[1:09:43] stay home and and and and just be on
[1:09:45] their own but we're not required to do
[1:09:47] that we're required to have Fellowship
[1:09:48] because that's the attribute of God
[1:09:50] forsake not the assembling of yourselves
[1:09:52] together right
[1:09:54] why is that because God wants fellowship
[1:09:56] with his children and he wants his
[1:09:58] children to have Fellowship it's kind of
[1:10:00] like if you're if you're the third part
[1:10:01] of a friendship and you want these two
[1:10:03] friends to get together and they don't
[1:10:04] get along it's pretty awkward for you so
[1:10:07] why would God have a kingdom that's
[1:10:08] awkward when we can't get along with
[1:10:11] each other we can't rub shoulders with
[1:10:12] each other and we can't shake hands with
[1:10:14] each other that's not God's design but
[1:10:16] that's still mankind involved and they
[1:10:18] were in that upper room for 10 days and
[1:10:21] there wasn't one man over the top of
[1:10:22] them saying you know this says when I'll
[1:10:24] set my approval upon it but it was led
[1:10:26] by the Holy Ghost right and they were
[1:10:28] trying to maybe I think brother Brandon
[1:10:30] brings up a reference where they might
[1:10:31] have tried to get out there and Peter
[1:10:32] said not yet not yet we're not ready yet
[1:10:34] why did Peter know they weren't ready
[1:10:35] yet because he was Peter and he knew he
[1:10:37] still had his temper he knew that he
[1:10:39] still had a grudge against the guy
[1:10:40] sitting in the corner and he's been
[1:10:41] avoiding him for 10 days and he knew
[1:10:43] there was something there he just
[1:10:45] couldn't fix and he knew that it was out
[1:10:46] of his and and but until he got to the
[1:10:49] point where he didn't care anymore and
[1:10:51] was willing to let go of The Grudge he
[1:10:53] had between this brother and that
[1:10:54] brother it never happened it would have
[1:10:57] been 50 days it would have been 100 days
[1:10:59] but until there was a surrender of their
[1:11:00] own selves God would not move into that
[1:11:03] place but once they got to the point
[1:11:05] where they were they wanted the whole
[1:11:07] word and nothing but the whole word and
[1:11:09] not just a piece and not just a part and
[1:11:11] not just a crumb but they wanted The
[1:11:13] Full Experience the same way that he
[1:11:15] promised it they were ready to let go of
[1:11:17] everything else you know when you get in
[1:11:18] desperate times and you realize there's
[1:11:20] no other option you'll you'll find out
[1:11:22] that once you hold on to you so dearly
[1:11:24] is really not that important and you'll
[1:11:26] let it go if you realize that it's it's
[1:11:28] life at stake it's your children's life
[1:11:31] at stake it's your family's life at
[1:11:33] stake and you realize you know my
[1:11:34] beautiful home in this state over here
[1:11:36] is really not that important if there's
[1:11:37] no word there you've got to go to where
[1:11:40] the word is Right you've got to come to
[1:11:42] where the carcass is and that's what the
[1:11:43] believer will do and they'll recognize
[1:11:45] that everything else is really not that
[1:11:47] important but it took them 10 days all
[1:11:50] right shoulder toosh shoulder
[1:11:53] fellowshipping with one another how many
[1:11:55] opinions were in that
[1:11:57] room at least 120 maybe
[1:12:01] 240 we're talking men women wives
[1:12:05] husbands together in one room for 10
[1:12:08] days opinions ideas
[1:12:12] doctrines I wonder what would happen if
[1:12:14] we all had to shove in one room for 10
[1:12:17] days I wouldn't wish that on you brother
[1:12:18] wendle
[1:12:20] but but it's got to be the same right
[1:12:24] it's got to come the same way so there's
[1:12:26] got to be something that's the same and
[1:12:29] Paul would pick this up and he say if
[1:12:31] there be there any consolation in Christ
[1:12:32] of any comfort of love if any Fellowship
[1:12:35] of the spirit if any bowels of mercies
[1:12:37] fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded
[1:12:40] having the same love being of one Accord
[1:12:42] and of one mind let nothing be done
[1:12:44] through Strife or vain Glory but in
[1:12:46] lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other
[1:12:49] better than themselves look not every
[1:12:50] man on his own things but every man also
[1:12:52] on the things of others let this mind be
[1:12:56] in you that was also in Christ Jesus
[1:13:00] that's why the Holy Spirit came into
[1:13:02] that room let this mind be in you now
[1:13:05] you've got to let this mind be in you
[1:13:08] that was also in Christ Jesus right so
[1:13:11] they had to get rid of their Humanity
[1:13:12] enough to let the mind of God come into
[1:13:14] them and dictate to them and control
[1:13:16] them and be their lord right right we're
[1:13:19] not come to talk about the message not
[1:13:21] enough to be associated with it say I go
[1:13:23] to a message church that the devil don't
[1:13:25] care and God don't care if you say you
[1:13:26] go to a message church or you're
[1:13:27] associated with it he wants you to be in
[1:13:30] the word which is the message but
[1:13:34] there's a
[1:13:35] label right there's a label there but
[1:13:38] you've got to know him like brother BR
[1:13:40] would say we learned from our Prophet
[1:13:41] right I didn't learn how to preach from
[1:13:42] anybody else but listening to tapes I
[1:13:44] don't know him real well I don't know
[1:13:45] the Bible real well but I know the
[1:13:47] author and maybe I can't quote all the
[1:13:49] quotes and I can't divide all the
[1:13:51] Mysteries and I can't but I know him and
[1:13:53] the only way you get to know him is by
[1:13:55] surrender of you and let his mind be in
[1:13:58] you right so these were these were
[1:14:01] people that fellowship with each other
[1:14:04] ate with each
[1:14:05] other you think they'd ever been
[1:14:07] offended at each
[1:14:12] other you think they'd ever been sore at
[1:14:14] one
[1:14:15] another had a hard time shaking hands
[1:14:17] with one another now these are these are
[1:14:19] hot-tempered high-tempered
[1:14:20] Jews all crammed into one room
[1:14:23] you think they ever got offended at one
[1:14:25] another come on you think they ever
[1:14:27] threw dirt at one another
[1:14:29] and threw a shoe at one
[1:14:33] another but they overcame
[1:14:36] it but they got together right how many
[1:14:39] in here said I'm not going to go
[1:14:43] back all
[1:14:47] right I don't care what they do to me
[1:14:49] I'm never going back there I don't care
[1:14:50] if they buy me a steak dinner I'm not
[1:14:52] going back to that church
[1:14:53] I'm not going to go back I don't you
[1:14:55] know I don't care but what happened was
[1:14:56] is you got offended at something and you
[1:14:59] let Humanity get in the way but I want
[1:15:00] to say that you're still here tonight
[1:15:03] and you're still here because you have
[1:15:05] something in you that was greater than
[1:15:07] the offense that came your way there's
[1:15:09] something in you that was greater than
[1:15:10] the hurt that you endured or the or the
[1:15:12] scar that you have there's something in
[1:15:14] you that's greater than even your own
[1:15:16] ability or you would not be here tonight
[1:15:17] but God rich and mercy has gave you the
[1:15:20] strength to be here tonight to continue
[1:15:22] on because of if it was up to us we
[1:15:24] would have all given up years ago and
[1:15:26] decades ago but we're here tonight
[1:15:28] because something in US is greater than
[1:15:31] the offenses that we've endured in this
[1:15:33] life something in US is greater than the
[1:15:35] than the brother didn't shake my hand or
[1:15:37] somebody sat in my seat or I was
[1:15:39] offended by this something in US is
[1:15:41] greater and that's what's brought us
[1:15:42] here
[1:15:44] tonight something in us has brought us
[1:15:47] what is it it's God Christ in flesh in
[1:15:50] you he is searching brother B said for
[1:15:53] someone that he can dwell in I say why
[1:15:57] not you why not me what brought you here
[1:16:00] you think it's your own you didn't have
[1:16:01] anywhere to be you might think well my
[1:16:02] mom drag me in here not really buddy but
[1:16:05] you're here because God put something in
[1:16:07] you and despite what you want to do in
[1:16:09] yourself there's something in you that
[1:16:11] pulls you to a higher plane than
[1:16:12] neighbor you would ever have the
[1:16:14] strength to go it's the strength of God
[1:16:16] in your life it's Grace in your life
[1:16:18] that God's brought you this far I would
[1:16:19] have given up years ago I have a list of
[1:16:22] reasons brother William
[1:16:24] I grew up in church you know how many
[1:16:26] offenses I've recorded in my
[1:16:29] life anybody that knows me personally
[1:16:31] you know how many people I've offended
[1:16:33] with my
[1:16:38] personality but I'm still here yes sir
[1:16:42] I've had a list of reasons I'll never go
[1:16:43] back and this isn't right and that's a
[1:16:45] hypocritical and this and this and this
[1:16:46] and this and this but I'm still here
[1:16:50] because something in me is greater than
[1:16:53] the
[1:16:54] humanity that surrounds it we all have
[1:16:57] we all walked in this door we've all
[1:16:58] been scarred we've all been hurt we've
[1:17:00] all been offended we've all been
[1:17:01] mistreated we've all been mishandled
[1:17:02] we've all been
[1:17:04] disrespected nobody more than the pastor
[1:17:06] probably but he's still here why because
[1:17:09] something in him is greater something in
[1:17:11] you is greater than all the offenses and
[1:17:13] all the backbiting and all the gossip
[1:17:15] and the lies told and the
[1:17:16] miscommunications is this okay
[1:17:19] misunderstandings he's got a big
[1:17:21] Shepherd so he can yank me if it's not
[1:17:23] okay but something in you is greater
[1:17:26] than that let me let me let me give you
[1:17:28] a promise from the scripture brother
[1:17:30] Merl you will be
[1:17:32] offended Jesus picks this up in Luke 17
[1:17:35] right have you ever heard Jesus say the
[1:17:37] word
[1:17:38] impossible the first verse would say
[1:17:40] then said he unto his disciples it is
[1:17:43] impossible brother John it's
[1:17:45] impossible but that offenses will come
[1:17:48] he's promising them you will be
[1:17:52] offended but woe unto him through whom
[1:17:54] they come it were better for him that a
[1:17:56] millstone were hanged about his neck and
[1:17:58] he cast into the sea than that he should
[1:17:59] offend one of these little ones take
[1:18:01] heed unto yourselves If thy brother
[1:18:03] trespass against thee rebuke him and if
[1:18:05] he repent forgive him and if he trespass
[1:18:07] against thee seven times in a day and
[1:18:10] seven times in a day turn to thee saying
[1:18:11] I Repent Thou shalt forgive him how many
[1:18:15] times seven and another gospel it says 7
[1:18:18] time
[1:18:19] 70
[1:18:21] woo brother con
[1:18:23] that that narrows it down right I could
[1:18:26] offend you seven times today and you'd
[1:18:28] have to forgive me if I asked for
[1:18:30] forgiveness there I mean 7 time 70
[1:18:33] that's that's multiple times in an
[1:18:41] hour Sister Amy you ever been offended
[1:18:43] that many times multiple times in an
[1:18:46] hour I have to forgive
[1:18:49] him 7even time
[1:18:51] 70 if he ask for forgiveness I must
[1:18:54] forgive him Thou shalt forgive him and
[1:18:57] you know what the apostles said to the
[1:18:59] Lord increase our
[1:19:04] faith they work together they fellowship
[1:19:08] with each other they had to endure one
[1:19:10] another they were at the church potlucks
[1:19:11] with each other they knew each other
[1:19:14] they slept in the same tent a lot of
[1:19:16] times with each other out in the
[1:19:17] wilderness with each other and they knew
[1:19:19] each other's weaknesses and strengths
[1:19:21] and they knew Peter was in the group
[1:19:23] you want me to forgive that man seven
[1:19:26] times 70 Lord you've got to increase our
[1:19:31] faith and the Lord
[1:19:34] replies the Lord said if ye had Faith as
[1:19:37] a grain of a mustard seed you might say
[1:19:40] unto this sycamine tree be thou plucked
[1:19:42] up by the root and be thou planted in
[1:19:43] the sea and it should obey you so he's
[1:19:47] telling them you don't need more faith
[1:19:49] you need simple Faith to overcome the
[1:19:51] offenses that your brother is going to
[1:19:53] put in your lap to overcome the offenses
[1:19:55] against husband and wife overcome the
[1:19:57] offenses against best friend and not
[1:19:59] best friend and you don't need a
[1:20:01] supernatural Faith you need the simple
[1:20:04] Faith now they're looking at this
[1:20:05] situation thinking it's impossible
[1:20:07] brother Mitch for us to do
[1:20:09] this and he's telling them you don't
[1:20:11] need a great faith you need the same
[1:20:13] faith that you walked in this room with
[1:20:14] to overcome every offense that you will
[1:20:17] endure in this life now Jesus is Calling
[1:20:19] this out specifically he says you can
[1:20:21] say to this sick tree be thou removed by
[1:20:24] the root and cast into the sea so I just
[1:20:26] thought it was interesting the sycamine
[1:20:28] tree has some particularities about it
[1:20:30] brother Kobe the sycamine tree has the
[1:20:33] largest root system in the Middle East
[1:20:35] there's not a tree in the Middle East
[1:20:37] that has deeper Roots than the sycamine
[1:20:39] tree he's talking about bitterness and
[1:20:41] offense in the
[1:20:43] Brotherhood and he says this root is
[1:20:45] deeper than any other root out there but
[1:20:48] if you could have the faith as a grain
[1:20:50] of a mustard seed you could say to this
[1:20:52] tree and by the roots it'll be plugged
[1:20:54] up now these these guys know how deep
[1:20:56] the root is and they're looking at him
[1:20:58] thinking by The Roots can't we just cut
[1:21:00] it off on the top and grind it down no
[1:21:02] he said by the roots this tree will come
[1:21:05] out of the ground and be cast in the sea
[1:21:07] now I don't know there's any arborist in
[1:21:08] here but most of us are looking at that
[1:21:10] job thinking we're going to slap it off
[1:21:11] and get a stump grinder and get rid of
[1:21:13] it but he's not calling for just a
[1:21:15] surface level recovery here he's calling
[1:21:18] for by the root of the issue if you
[1:21:21] could have the faith as the grain of a
[1:21:23] mustard seed that root would must obey
[1:21:26] you and be plucked up and cast into the
[1:21:29] sea now this sic ofine tree has roots
[1:21:31] that they call the crab root or the
[1:21:33] cancer root because they dig and they
[1:21:35] dig and they dig and it's the deepest
[1:21:37] root
[1:21:38] system of any tree in the Middle East so
[1:21:40] he's not just saying any tree he's not
[1:21:43] just saying this mosquite bush or that
[1:21:44] bush but he's saying this sycamine tree
[1:21:48] the one with the deepest roots and has
[1:21:50] the deepest stronghold in the ground
[1:21:51] will be removed move by the root and
[1:21:53] cast into the sea if you could just have
[1:21:55] the simple Faith to stand on the word of
[1:21:58] God it doesn't take a great a great
[1:22:00] Shining Light coming down from heaven
[1:22:01] but I already sent my word to you that
[1:22:03] you have the faith already in you to
[1:22:06] perform
[1:22:07] it this sycamine tree Bears a fig as its
[1:22:12] fruit it's identical brother William to
[1:22:14] the Mulberry Tree it stands side by side
[1:22:17] of the mberry tree you can't tell the
[1:22:18] difference between the two but by the
[1:22:20] fruit of it the fruit of the SI ofite
[1:22:22] tree is bitter bitter bitter to The
[1:22:24] Taste unedible to The Taste and the
[1:22:27] Mulberry produces a great fig a mulberry
[1:22:30] bush and you can make pies and jams
[1:22:32] and but not the sycamine
[1:22:35] tree it's
[1:22:37] bitter it's bitter in every way it's
[1:22:40] bitter down to the sap that's within the
[1:22:42] tree and he's saying this tree can be
[1:22:46] removed if you just have the simple
[1:22:49] faith it doesn't take a great work up
[1:22:50] but the simple Faith to say unto to this
[1:22:52] tree be thou removed by the root totally
[1:22:56] eradicated totally destroyed by the root
[1:22:59] and cast into the sea now the other
[1:23:01] interesting thing about this tree is
[1:23:03] it's not pollinated by bees because it's
[1:23:06] too bitter and the fruit is too hard for
[1:23:08] the bee to get into the pollen so you
[1:23:10] know what it's it's pollinated by
[1:23:14] wasps the WASP attacks the Fig and it
[1:23:17] stings into the Fig and it's hard enough
[1:23:19] where it can reach the pollen of that
[1:23:20] and now you've got a wasp who's not a
[1:23:22] friend to anybody does anybody here
[1:23:23] collect wasps you got a you got a wasp
[1:23:26] Hive in your backyard that you get honey
[1:23:28] from no nobody's no I think everybody's
[1:23:31] probably on high alert when a wasp flies
[1:23:32] in the room everybody's aware of it a
[1:23:34] bumblebee flies in yeah but a
[1:23:39] wasp but yet we'll let a bitter Spirit
[1:23:41] I'm not talking about trees talking
[1:23:43] about how the devil Works through
[1:23:45] spirits in the church we'll let that
[1:23:47] bitter Spirit come and fly on our
[1:23:49] shoulder now if it was a literal red
[1:23:51] wasp we would never let that thing land
[1:23:52] on your
[1:23:53] shoulder cuz it only produces danger it
[1:23:56] only produces harm to you it only is
[1:23:58] going to produce
[1:24:01] bitterness but yet we'll let it move in
[1:24:05] and this wash has stung this fruit and
[1:24:06] it's taken this bitter pollen it's moved
[1:24:08] to this one moved to that one and moved
[1:24:10] to that one you see how quick it is for
[1:24:12] it to spread around and now this
[1:24:14] bitterness and now there's a root of
[1:24:15] bitterness in here you don't even know
[1:24:16] where it came from but there's a wasp
[1:24:19] carrying that pollen through the
[1:24:21] church now maybe not this church maybe
[1:24:23] don't have that issue but it comes in
[1:24:25] different waves well did you hear about
[1:24:27] so and
[1:24:29] so no I didn't what what happened oh
[1:24:32] well I shouldn't say bless God but this
[1:24:34] is what
[1:24:36] happened pray for them I can tell you if
[1:24:39] you're going to pray for them
[1:24:41] right it's a
[1:24:43] wasp it moves through through through
[1:24:47] simple things but it's a wasp and it
[1:24:49] will never come to any good it's only
[1:24:52] bitter
[1:24:53] it only produces
[1:24:55] bitterness it's not sweet like honey
[1:24:58] it's a bitter tree this tree the bark
[1:25:01] from this tree and the wood from this
[1:25:02] tree you know what it's used for
[1:25:06] caskets it's used to make caskets
[1:25:10] because he's telling the disciples
[1:25:11] bitterness the root of bitterness will
[1:25:13] only produce
[1:25:16] death but he's telling them if you could
[1:25:19] have the faith of the grain of a mustard
[1:25:21] seed I know everybody in here has
[1:25:23] probably seen that in Sunday school they
[1:25:24] pass out the Mustard Seed jar You'
[1:25:25] probably done it before in your ministry
[1:25:27] just pass out the Mustard Seed jar and
[1:25:29] everybody looks at that little thing and
[1:25:30] they say this and they're saying you
[1:25:32] want me to use this to get that out he's
[1:25:35] saying yeah because any level of
[1:25:38] god-given faith is greater than any
[1:25:40] oppression that you will face in this
[1:25:42] life any level you may not have much but
[1:25:44] what you have is enough to overcome
[1:25:47] every trial every enemy every Affliction
[1:25:50] every depression every anxiety every
[1:25:52] sickness the faith that you've been
[1:25:53] given is already enough they said
[1:25:55] increase our faith he said no I'm not
[1:25:58] going to increase your faith you need
[1:25:59] the simple Faith as a grain of a mustard
[1:26:02] seed to overcome this issue now we've
[1:26:05] been all put here together to be the
[1:26:07] same church why was it the pattern
[1:26:09] because they overcame one another they
[1:26:11] overcame Humanity they overcame hurts
[1:26:13] they overcame scars they overcame
[1:26:15] offenses they overcame disappointments
[1:26:18] I'm going to disappoint you I probably
[1:26:20] disappointed you in the in the 45
[1:26:22] minutes I've been up here but you got to
[1:26:24] let it
[1:26:29] go brother Caleb didn't call me for my
[1:26:31] birthday and I'm offended at him
[1:26:33] now but I got to let it
[1:26:38] go I I'm a deacon at the church and you
[1:26:40] know people get offended about the
[1:26:42] strangest
[1:26:43] things I sometimes it just baffles my
[1:26:46] mind you get offended about that and
[1:26:47] somebody comes in and they've got a
[1:26:48] regular seat brother Austin that's their
[1:26:51] seat
[1:26:53] that's where they sit they come in the
[1:26:54] back and somebody's sitting in their
[1:27:00] seat I want you to move them no I'm not
[1:27:03] going to move them there's a lot of
[1:27:05] other
[1:27:07] seeds but you know what they
[1:27:13] do song leaders just say praise and
[1:27:15] raise your
[1:27:19] hands why because they're offended and
[1:27:22] they want you to know they're offended
[1:27:24] and they want the song leader to know
[1:27:25] they're offended they want the preacher
[1:27:27] to know they're offended they want
[1:27:28] everybody to know that they've been
[1:27:29] offended because they are justified in
[1:27:31] their offense and you know what they've
[1:27:33] done they have robbed themselves of a
[1:27:35] victory in that service ever changing
[1:27:37] their life ever touching them ever
[1:27:39] touching their kids anybody in their Pew
[1:27:41] will probably not be touched by the Lord
[1:27:43] because they have an offense that they
[1:27:45] are caring and they won't let it go and
[1:27:47] they say no I'm justified in this
[1:27:51] offense
[1:27:53] and not only that but they will have
[1:27:56] that mean mug on so hard that they will
[1:27:58] actually Rob Victory from the entire
[1:28:01] service and now your little offense that
[1:28:03] you are carrying has robbed somebody of
[1:28:06] their healing of a baptism of the Holy
[1:28:08] Ghost of a saving of a soul and of the
[1:28:10] miraculous taking place if we want the
[1:28:12] miraculous to take place in our midst
[1:28:14] then we've got to let go of something
[1:28:15] right we've got to get rid of something
[1:28:17] and if we're going to Bear our own
[1:28:19] offenses and say well I'm justified in
[1:28:20] this I'm not asking whether you're
[1:28:22] Justified I'm saying to let it go anyway
[1:28:25] I don't want to hear about your offense
[1:28:26] I don't want to hear about your sorrow
[1:28:28] or your hurt I'm saying let it go use
[1:28:30] the faith that you have to get over it
[1:28:32] in the best way sincere way possible I
[1:28:34] can say get over it we've got a Rapture
[1:28:38] to take We are rooting out for a Rapture
[1:28:41] we're not going to make a Rapture L we
[1:28:42] take the hoe out like brother brandom
[1:28:44] said and Grub out everything that's not
[1:28:46] of him grub out all unbelief grub out
[1:28:48] all skepticism grub out all bitterness
[1:28:50] grub out all all unbelief in our life
[1:28:53] all backbiting and backstabbing and this
[1:28:55] and that grub it
[1:28:58] out we've got a Rapture to take friends
[1:29:02] I want you to be there and I want you to
[1:29:03] be there and you want me to be there we
[1:29:05] all want to be there so let's get with
[1:29:07] the program as brother B would say root
[1:29:10] it
[1:29:10] out you've got the power to do it you
[1:29:13] may not feel like you have much but what
[1:29:15] you have is
[1:29:17] enough what do you have well I just have
[1:29:19] a few Loaves and a few fish it was
[1:29:21] enough
[1:29:22] put it in the hands of him and it's
[1:29:24] enough faith and it'll keep coming and
[1:29:26] it'll keep multiplying and it'll keep
[1:29:28] growing but what you already have that
[1:29:30] you're breathing with is enough Faith to
[1:29:33] overcome the offenses that you've faced
[1:29:35] in this life bless the Lord you've got
[1:29:38] enough already in you to become the
[1:29:40] perfect Church James would say it like
[1:29:42] this out of the same mouth preceded
[1:29:43] blessings and cursings my brethren these
[1:29:45] things ought not to be so does a
[1:29:47] fountain send forth the same the same
[1:29:50] place Sweet Water and bitter can the a
[1:29:52] fig tree my brethren bear Olive berries
[1:29:53] either a Vine uh figs so can no Fountain
[1:29:57] both yield salt water and fresh who is a
[1:30:00] wise man and IND du with knowledge among
[1:30:02] you let him show you out of a good
[1:30:03] conversation his works with meekness and
[1:30:05] wisdom but if you have bitter envying
[1:30:07] and strife in your hearts Glory not and
[1:30:09] lie not against the truth this wisdom
[1:30:11] descendeth not from above but is Earthly
[1:30:13] sensual devilish for where envying and
[1:30:15] strife is there is confusion in every
[1:30:17] evil work but the wisdom that is from
[1:30:19] above is first pure and Peaceable gentle
[1:30:22] easy to be entreated full of mercy and
[1:30:24] good fruits without partiality and
[1:30:26] without hypocrisy and the fruit of
[1:30:28] righteousness is sown in the Peace of
[1:30:30] them that make
[1:30:32] peace that's quite a stature of a
[1:30:34] perfect man to live up to
[1:30:36] sir we can't have both bitter and sweet
[1:30:40] water coming out of the same
[1:30:44] mouth can't say well bless God I love
[1:30:47] that brother and then turn around and
[1:30:48] say something else but let me take this
[1:30:50] another stage deeper now
[1:30:53] now what about you and your
[1:30:57] offenses what about that Spirit of
[1:30:59] condemnation that rises up every time
[1:31:01] you go to worship and every time you get
[1:31:02] used by the Lord and you think no I got
[1:31:04] this Spirit of condemnation on me and I
[1:31:06] I can't let it go the same faith that
[1:31:08] you're breathing
[1:31:10] with the same simple faith and I can
[1:31:14] prove this by the scripture in Exodus
[1:31:16] the 15th chapter they come out of a
[1:31:18] great Victory right they're they're
[1:31:20] they're coming out of the Red Sea and
[1:31:21] brother and M they're on top of the
[1:31:22] world we've just seen every enemy we
[1:31:25] have destroyed under our feet and miam's
[1:31:27] got her tambourine she's dancing around
[1:31:29] you know what three verses
[1:31:31] later
[1:31:33] three we should have never left
[1:31:36] Egypt we should have just stayed there
[1:31:40] what happened they hit Bitter
[1:31:42] Water they come out of that victory walk
[1:31:44] right into bitter water and before you
[1:31:46] know it the great Victory they
[1:31:50] had I don't like
[1:31:53] Moses should have stayed back in
[1:31:55] Egypt was better off where I came
[1:31:59] from but the Lord spake unto Moses and
[1:32:02] said there's a tree right there by the
[1:32:04] bank take that tree and put it in that
[1:32:06] water and it'll become sweet it'll
[1:32:08] become the sweetest water that they've
[1:32:10] ever tasted brother benam comes down
[1:32:11] picks that up and he says you know what
[1:32:12] that tree was it was
[1:32:15] hup hup whatever you want to say
[1:32:17] hup a simple Faith right put simple
[1:32:22] faith in that and you'll overcome it and
[1:32:24] you'll recognize I'm still Victorious
[1:32:26] you'll recognize I'm still on top of it
[1:32:28] you'll recognize my Egyptians are still
[1:32:30] dead you'll recognize I'm still
[1:32:31] overcoming this thing just put a little
[1:32:33] simple faith in that and that bitter
[1:32:34] water will become sweet to The Taste you
[1:32:37] don't need a great faith you need the
[1:32:38] same simple Faith you've already got and
[1:32:41] apply it to the right thing you know
[1:32:43] what else hup was used for it was a
[1:32:45] paintbrush brother right a paintbrush
[1:32:49] for the blood and Joshua took that hiss
[1:32:52] up in there
[1:32:53] and painted it and painted it and
[1:32:55] painted it brother Kevin I don't think
[1:32:57] he stopped just at the door frame I
[1:32:59] think he went all the way across this
[1:33:00] front wall and all the way down the side
[1:33:02] wall I want to know I want everybody to
[1:33:04] know that I'm covered in this blood and
[1:33:05] use that simple Faith to apply the blood
[1:33:08] over his situation so the faith that you
[1:33:10] already have is the Revelation you need
[1:33:13] to apply the blood just apply it you've
[1:33:16] already got the brush you've already got
[1:33:18] the blood you've just got to apply it
[1:33:19] over the condition root it out root it
[1:33:24] out we've got a Rapture to take there's
[1:33:26] gifts in this room that we need there's
[1:33:28] people sitting here that we need to take
[1:33:30] a Rapture we're not complete without you
[1:33:32] and you're not complete without me so
[1:33:34] whatever it is holding us back let it go
[1:33:37] let it go and let God use it let it go
[1:33:40] and let God activate that that gift
[1:33:42] within you let it go and let God use you
[1:33:44] to your full potential I don't think any
[1:33:46] of us want to make it there and
[1:33:48] recognize that we had something within
[1:33:49] us that we didn't let go to God now
[1:33:52] listen a predestinated seed will be
[1:33:53] there no matter what but the but the
[1:33:55] devil can rob you of your
[1:33:59] Victory I'd rather get there
[1:34:01] Victorious I'd rather get there knowing
[1:34:04] who I am knowing what I've been called
[1:34:06] for knowing that I'm able to overcome
[1:34:08] every enemy not crawling in on my knees
[1:34:11] begging for something but we're not
[1:34:12] Beggars we're Sons and Daughters of God
[1:34:15] who have been given fullness and
[1:34:16] authority to ask him at his word and it
[1:34:19] shall be given unto you it's already
[1:34:22] yours it's already yours when I look at
[1:34:24] the message I don't read a message of I
[1:34:26] can't do it and I can't do this and I
[1:34:28] can't do that I read this message and I
[1:34:30] say I I've already can I already have
[1:34:32] I've already overcome I've already won
[1:34:34] on the other side I I've already taken
[1:34:36] him out his word not just I can and dos
[1:34:39] and don'ts but this is a message telling
[1:34:41] me that I have already overcome through
[1:34:44] he that is in
[1:34:46] me but somewhere along this journey
[1:34:48] we've picked up things and we put them
[1:34:50] in our pockets I'm I'm Whiting down here
[1:34:52] don't get worried Michael I know you got
[1:34:54] to work
[1:34:56] tomorrow but we picked up things yeah
[1:34:59] and they're weighing us
[1:35:02] down you know where we picked them up
[1:35:04] somewhere here somewhere this brother
[1:35:06] didn't Shake our hand or this this this
[1:35:08] quote was misused and now we're hurt by
[1:35:10] this or we were genuinely offended by
[1:35:11] somebody they really did US dirty and
[1:35:13] they took advantage of us
[1:35:15] and but you know how you get rid of
[1:35:18] it just like this
[1:35:20] here
[1:35:22] I picked up this you know how I get rid
[1:35:24] of
[1:35:28] it that's it you don't need more
[1:35:32] faith you need the simple faith that you
[1:35:35] already
[1:35:37] have let it go brother Brandon would say
[1:35:41] that the Avenues and the channels for
[1:35:42] the Holy Spirit to flow through are
[1:35:44] clogged up because we won't let it
[1:35:47] go I think it's time to let it go I
[1:35:50] think it's time to let go of our own
[1:35:51] ideas our own doctrines our own our own
[1:35:54] our own abuses let's not look at this
[1:35:56] word through abused lenses or abused and
[1:35:58] if this brother uses this quote well I
[1:36:00] I'm G I'm going to go this way with it
[1:36:01] well that's just an offended look at the
[1:36:03] gospel why not take it for what it
[1:36:06] says take the whole word and take in the
[1:36:09] whole word to yourself and say I want it
[1:36:11] all I don't want just this that makes me
[1:36:13] feel good and this that I understand I
[1:36:14] want all the word and I want every
[1:36:16] promise that's in that word and if you
[1:36:18] take every promise that's in that word
[1:36:19] it means you have to have fellowship
[1:36:20] with every everybody in this room God
[1:36:22] bless you
[1:36:25] buddy we want it all right we don't just
[1:36:28] want some of it we want it all we want
[1:36:30] all that the father has for us but it's
[1:36:34] really hard to run this race when you're
[1:36:39] lopsided carrying all these
[1:36:44] weights
[1:36:45] Justified justified in our offenses
[1:36:48] there were real real things that people
[1:36:50] hurt us with with real wounds that we're
[1:36:53] bearing but you got to let it
[1:36:57] go if we pick this up and we we're
[1:37:00] walking along life's journey with us and
[1:37:01] we get along that straight and narrow
[1:37:02] way we might just think it's just a
[1:37:03] little bit a little offense but we won't
[1:37:06] fit through the Gap Caleb we've got to
[1:37:09] let it
[1:37:13] go it's just that
[1:37:15] easy Let It Go we've got a Rapture to
[1:37:19] take amen we've got got a word to
[1:37:22] manifest we've got a body to change into
[1:37:26] what we need to do is let go of every
[1:37:28] offense every question every
[1:37:33] doubt I believe we're at the stage of
[1:37:35] the journey where there shouldn't be one
[1:37:36] doubt about whether this message is true
[1:37:38] or
[1:37:39] not now I don't need to come cycle
[1:37:42] through this entire message and break
[1:37:43] out my red volumes and break out my
[1:37:45] table and explain to you why this is
[1:37:47] this way and why this is that way we're
[1:37:49] way too far past that you know how you
[1:37:51] get rid of that you let go of the
[1:37:53] unbelief you let go of the question you
[1:37:55] let go of the skepticism you let go of
[1:37:57] the uncertainty within you and you and
[1:38:00] you say I want only the word and all the
[1:38:02] word and if my intellect doesn't match
[1:38:04] that my intellect is wrong I'm going to
[1:38:06] let it go now I don't have to explain
[1:38:07] everything to you and tell you why this
[1:38:09] is that way and tell you why this
[1:38:11] doesn't line up with your thinking on
[1:38:13] this or that you know how it goes you
[1:38:14] your guy will try to get you in a corner
[1:38:15] and say well you need to make this line
[1:38:16] up I don't have to make anything line up
[1:38:19] I'm a Believer it already lines up it if
[1:38:22] my thinking is this way then my thinking
[1:38:24] is wrong the word is right I think we're
[1:38:27] too far down the road to have any bit
[1:38:29] any hold back any any Rock within our
[1:38:32] pocket that we think well maybe there's
[1:38:33] a backup plan there is no plan B in a
[1:38:36] believer's life we don't have a backup
[1:38:39] plan I don't have a a a second choice
[1:38:42] here but you got to let go of all
[1:38:46] unbelief he's trying to move within you
[1:38:49] your channel your Avenue
[1:38:52] why not root it
[1:38:56] out it's the only way we're going to
[1:38:58] make
[1:38:59] it if we can root it out say Lord I've
[1:39:03] had enough of this I don't know about
[1:39:05] you friends but I've had enough of me
[1:39:11] yes sir you tell me what problem you
[1:39:15] fixed in your
[1:39:16] mind and it worked out just
[1:39:20] perfectly never
[1:39:22] happened but God
[1:39:27] Alone brother William I got brothers and
[1:39:29] I've argued with them but I've never
[1:39:31] argued with one of them as much as I've
[1:39:33] argued with
[1:39:35] myself how can two walk together lest
[1:39:39] they be agreed there's still some
[1:39:41] Humanity left in
[1:39:43] there there's still some of me left in

[1:41:06] offended I've been offended more times
[1:41:08] than I could count but I'm still
[1:41:12] here you've been offended but you're
[1:41:15] still
[1:41:16] here what does that have to do with the
[1:41:19] word Let It Go
[1:41:24] amen something has taken root in us
[1:41:26] that's not of us but we can say with the
[1:41:30] simple
[1:41:31] Faith cast into the sea let me ask what
[1:41:35] sea was it cast
[1:41:38] into where
[1:41:40] Glory was it the Sea of
[1:41:43] Galilee the Sea of God's
[1:41:49] forgetfulness
[1:41:59] never to be seen
[1:42:00] again I don't know about you Michael
[1:42:03] there's some things in my life that I
[1:42:04] would want to never be seen
[1:42:11] Again cast into the sea of God's
[1:42:15] forgetfulness by the root of the
[1:42:19] issue so you know those victories that
[1:42:21] we come up and we think oh well it's
[1:42:23] just a matter of time before we come
[1:42:24] back down not this time prise lord not
[1:42:28] this
[1:42:29] time this time is the final overthrow of
[1:42:32] this struggle I'm not going to have this
[1:42:34] temptation anymore I'm not going to have
[1:42:36] this desire anymore I'm not going to
[1:42:37] have this Affliction anymore but it will
[1:42:40] be defeated tonight by the faith in the
[1:42:42] word of God the simple faith of the
[1:42:45] hisop
[1:42:48] tree if it was up to us Kevin we'd have
[1:42:50] our ourselves that there's no way we're
[1:42:52] going to make it but we're using our own
[1:42:54] intellect I think it's time to say what
[1:42:55] the blood says about us the blood speaks
[1:42:59] better things that we could ever speak
[1:43:01] for ourselves brother Kobe or
[1:43:03] whoever the blood speaks better things I
[1:43:06] don't know who's playing the music but
[1:43:07] you can go ahead and come the blood
[1:43:09] speaks better
[1:43:13] things than we could say over ourselves
[1:43:16] Sister Amy if it was up to us we would
[1:43:18] we'd have ourselves painted in a corner
[1:43:19] somewhere we're never going to make
[1:43:20] because we know ourselves too well but
[1:43:23] the blood's not looking at that part of
[1:43:26] you cast into the sea of God's
[1:43:31] forgetfulness never to be brought up
[1:43:33] again never to be dug up again there's
[1:43:35] no root there for it to grow back
[1:43:38] there's no life source for it there but
[1:43:40] it's utterly destroyed and cast into the
[1:43:48] sea a perfect walk now we're going to
[1:43:51] have struggles we're going to have
[1:43:52] trials we're going to have mistakes trip
[1:43:55] ups but the Root's
[1:44:03] gone friends I've seen too much to to go
[1:44:06] back on this I know it works I know
[1:44:09] there are things in my life that I
[1:44:10] thought I would never get rid of now
[1:44:13] they're just a fake
[1:44:14] memory something that just just blows by
[1:44:17] Brother the John there's things in our
[1:44:18] life that we if we could go back down
[1:44:20] but we don't want that memory there's a
[1:44:23] memory far past that far beyond that
[1:44:27] before there ever was a drug or a a beer
[1:44:30] bottle or a a pain pill or a a a a a a
[1:44:34] website before there was any of that
[1:44:37] there was another
[1:44:39] you where were
[1:44:42] you God took a perfect picture of
[1:44:45] you before there was a scar before there
[1:44:49] was a hurt before before there was a
[1:44:51] sorrow there's a perfect you and that's
[1:44:54] what the blood's looking at why don't we
[1:44:55] let the blood speak over us say I say to
[1:45:00] I I want I want the blood to speak what
[1:45:02] it really thinks about me it says I'm
[1:45:05] free it says I'm Justified it says that
[1:45:08] I never did it in the first place it
[1:45:10] says that I'm making a Rapture it says
[1:45:11] that I've got another body the blood
[1:45:13] says that I'm going to fulfill this word
[1:45:16] and be the Fulfillment of this age the
[1:45:18] blood has already spoken it over me I I
[1:45:20] think it's time we use our simple faith
[1:45:22] and take what the blood says about
[1:45:26] us I'm
[1:45:29] forgiven Hallelujah you know how easy it
[1:45:35] is you just let it go it takes an action
[1:45:39] of Faith right brother B would teach
[1:45:40] that faith in action you just let it
[1:45:44] [Music]
[1:45:49] go little bitterness little offense
[1:45:53] we've all got
[1:46:00] them you know what happens brother Kevin
[1:46:02] you'll find you're a lot
[1:46:04] lighter and the more you let go the
[1:46:06] lighter you get and the more you release
[1:46:09] the Freer you get and the more you you
[1:46:11] take the shackles off the more liberated
[1:46:13] you become and you wonder how somebody
[1:46:14] can just Worship in total Liberty and
[1:46:16] worship in total freedom it's because
[1:46:18] they've let
[1:46:19] go
[1:46:21] and they Saidi going to do I'm going to
[1:46:23] I'm going to be who God says I am God
[1:46:26] says I'm chosen God says I'm spotless

[1:46:32] the first place Hallelujah let the blood
