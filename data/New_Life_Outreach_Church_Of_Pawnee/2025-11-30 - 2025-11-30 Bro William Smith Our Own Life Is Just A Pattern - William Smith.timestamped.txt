[37:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. You may be seated
[37:16] for a moment.
[37:18] Praise the Lord.
[37:20] It's good to be home.
[37:25] &gt;&gt; We sure missed you.
[37:29] We uh don't call very much and don't
[37:31] text very much anymore. But
[37:34] when I'm at work, you're asleep. When
[37:37] you're at work, I'm I'm asleep.
[37:40] But, uh, we're just so thankful to be
[37:43] here and and it's good to come and
[37:49] see my girl and my boy
[37:53] and I appreciate Brother Mitch sharing
[37:57] his son with me.
[38:00] But, you know, it's just so glad to come
[38:03] home to people that truly love you. And
[38:08] I know you do.
[38:10] Yeah.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; And
[38:13] I've been a lot of places,
[38:16] but me and Sharon call this home. We
[38:20] went to our house. It hasn't sold yet.
[38:22] And did a little bit of things to it for
[38:25] about an hour on Friday. And I said,
[38:29] "Well, dear, this is our little home."
[38:34] She says, "Yeah,
[38:35] but it don't feel like home no more. We
[38:38] don't have anything in it. It's It's
[38:40] empty bare.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; But when we went by some of you guys'
[38:45] house, we said
[38:48] that's our family right there.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:50] &gt;&gt; And we mean it.
[38:53] &gt;&gt; Brother William had to leave the nest
[38:57] to go take care of God's flock.
[39:00] And God has blessed us there.
[39:04] people that didn't have church for a
[39:06] year or 11 years,
[39:12] &gt;&gt; seeing God just work mightily in every
[39:16] one of their hearts.
[39:18] &gt;&gt; The preaching of the gospel does things
[39:21] to Christians.
[39:24] It judges those that aren't Christians,
[39:28] but it makes those that love God grow.
[39:32] And God blesses them. And I've seen God
[39:35] really do a lot in my little flock that
[39:38] God has given me to take care of.
[39:41] Leading them to green pastors and
[39:44] &gt;&gt; and things like that. having brother
[39:47] Josh come preach here not long ago and
[39:49] they're still talking about him and they
[39:52] talk about brother man uh brother
[39:54] Michael that he came and ministered and
[39:58] and
[39:59] just can't wait till they come back
[40:01] again
[40:03] but we're going to have to steal your
[40:04] pastor here pretty soon because they
[40:06] keep asking about brother Windle and
[40:08] they keep saying well you got to bring
[40:10] brother Dur and his lovely little wife
[40:12] cuz we love them and so one in today's
[40:15] days, we're going to get them up there
[40:17] to to minister for us. And but before I
[40:21] start crying, we better get into this
[40:23] message. Before I start crying,
[40:26] if we can open our Bibles to Ephesians
[40:28] 2,
[40:30] we're going to Ephesians 2,
[40:33] 1 Corinthians 12, and Luke 4.
[40:38] Praise the Lord. Just want you to know
[40:41] we love you very much.
[40:44] and those that couldn't be here tonight
[40:46] and out of town, please tell them that
[40:49] we sure do love them and miss them.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:53] &gt;&gt; But here in Ephesians 2, and we're going
[40:55] to start here at the 19th verse,
[40:59] and before we read, let's just pray and
[41:02] ask the Lord to help me.
[41:04] Heavenly Father, we just love you, Lord.
[41:07] And Lord, we
[41:11] tired, Lord, and been up since around 5
[41:15] or 4:00 this morning, Lord. And we just
[41:18] ask you, Father God, to help me to get
[41:21] out of the way and you strengthen this
[41:23] body just enough to be able to speak
[41:26] through it, Father God.
[41:28] Lord, I pray that you bless each and
[41:30] every heart that's in this building this
[41:32] this evening, Lord.
[41:34] those that are on the internet, Lord. We
[41:37] just pray that you bless them, Lord God.
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Father, just take these words of life,
[41:43] Lord, and multiply it into your
[41:45] children, Lord, and move me out of the
[41:46] way, Lord, and just use me, Father, for
[41:50] your glory. Let me say what you want me
[41:53] to say, Lord.
[41:55] And Lord, we just ask you, Lord.
[41:59] Brother Sam's, Lord, this morning, Lord,
[42:02] you came down in a mighty way. And Lord,
[42:05] there was five or six people that came
[42:08] up and one young man that
[42:12] got on his face, Lord, and cried out to
[42:15] the Lord Jesus.
[42:17] And Lord, I believe you gave him victory
[42:20] over some things that was going into his
[42:22] life, Lord.
[42:24] And Lord, those that Father God, that
[42:26] came up with problems and situations,
[42:30] Lord, and we prayed for them. We just
[42:33] ask you to be with them, Father God,
[42:34] this evening.
[42:36] We know how the devil goes after a
[42:38] service, Lord, and goes out and starts
[42:40] attacking their their bodies and their
[42:43] minds. And we just ask you to comfort
[42:45] them tonight, Lord.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; Give them rest, Lord. Give us all rest
[42:49] in the name of the Lord. We thank you
[42:52] for everything you do for us Lord and
[42:55] help me Lord to say the right words the
[42:57] right way. Father God we love you in
[43:00] Jesus name. Amen. Here in Ephesians 2
[43:05] and 19, it says, "Now therefore, ye are
[43:08] no more strangers and foreigners, but
[43:12] fellow citizens with the saints and of
[43:16] the household of God, and are built up
[43:20] the foundation of the apostles and
[43:23] prophets, Jesus Christ himself, being
[43:26] chief corner stone,
[43:29] and whom all
[43:32] all The building fitly framed together
[43:35] groweth unto a holy temple in the Lord,
[43:41] in whom ye also are built together for a
[43:46] inhabitant of God through the spirit.
[43:50] Let's go to 1 Corinthians 12 and we're
[43:54] going to start at the 11th verse there.
[43:57] But all these workketh
[44:00] that one in the same self-same spirit,
[44:05] dividing to every man several as he
[44:10] will.
[44:11] For as the body is one and hath many
[44:15] members, and all the members of that one
[44:19] body being many, are one body. So also
[44:24] is Christ.
[44:26] For by one spear are we all baptized
[44:29] unto one body, whether we be Jews or
[44:33] Gentiles, whether we'd be bound or free,
[44:38] and having
[44:40] been all made to drink into one spirit.
[44:44] For the body is not one member, but
[44:48] many.
[44:50] Let's go to Luke 4 and4.
[44:57] And Jesus answered him, saying, "It is
[45:00] written,
[45:01] that man shall not live by bread alone,
[45:04] but by every word that proceedth out of
[45:06] the mouth of God." You may be seated.
[45:10] I would like to minister for just a
[45:12] little while on your own life is just a
[45:16] pattern.
[45:18] I looked up pattern and I looked up and
[45:21] it talks about pattern and it talks
[45:23] about the blueprint. And so it means
[45:29] a and and it's just to me as as a
[45:32] builder at one time and getting the
[45:35] blueprints and you see this building
[45:38] from ground level to the time it
[45:41] finishes to the roof and and then all
[45:43] the appliances and and the bathroom
[45:46] stuff and everything when it's completed
[45:49] for somebody that can move into it. It's
[45:53] amazing to see it's on the blueprint.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Even the faucets are in the blueprint.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; The grout is in the blueprint.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:04] &gt;&gt; And we go by the blueprint, it will be
[46:06] exactly the house will be exactly what
[46:09] the house is going to look like of the
[46:12] blueprint.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; And it's the same way. If we read the
[46:18] book and we eat the book and we become
[46:21] the book, we're going to look just like
[46:24] Jesus.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; All right,
[46:26] &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters. That's what has to
[46:28] be in our hearts this evening is to be
[46:30] like Jesus.
[46:32] &gt;&gt; We want him to run our lives. We want
[46:35] him to give us the grace to love one
[46:37] another and do things together. And not
[46:40] only that, to show the fruits to those
[46:43] that need a Jesus. You are going to be a
[46:47] Jesus to them. If you can realize it and
[46:50] don't let the world put put something on
[46:53] you, but you put it on the PEOPLE THAT
[46:55] JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME YESTERDAY,
[46:57] TODAY, and forever. And he's taken me
[46:59] out OF THE BALLROOM. HE'S TAKEN THE
[47:01] DRUGS FROM ME. HE'S DONE THESE things
[47:03] because what did I do? I STAYED WITH THE
[47:05] PATTERN.
[47:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. If you go off the pattern, YOUR
[47:08] HOUSE IS GOING TO FALL.
[47:09] &gt;&gt; If the foundation is isn't right, it's
[47:11] going to fall.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; But oh, if we can stay on that pattern,
[47:16] &gt;&gt; oh, something is good going to fixing to
[47:18] happen.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; So, in the dictionary, I looked and it
[47:23] says design used as a guide or
[47:27] establishes the way of doing things, a
[47:30] blueprint, plans or design for creating
[47:34] something. blueprint is a detailed plan.
[47:38] This Bible is a
[47:41] this thing right here.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Has a plan for you.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; You're in the plan.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; You just got to find yourself where
[47:49] you're at.
[47:51] &gt;&gt; Are you an antichrist or are you the
[47:53] bride of Jesus Christ?
[47:55] &gt;&gt; You got to go in there and find out.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; Are you taking the creeds or you taking
[48:00] thus sayith the Lord?
[48:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[48:04] &gt;&gt; In the beginning, God had a thought of
[48:07] life. So, he spoke the word of things to
[48:11] existence. He had a great plan and he
[48:16] was making himself a place and a family
[48:20] to love and to have.
[48:23] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[48:24] &gt;&gt; He wasn't up in in space somewhere
[48:27] thinking of himself.
[48:29] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; He never looked at himself. He knew who
[48:33] he was, but he wanted you to be a part
[48:37] of a family.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; He wanted to choose you to be a part OF
[48:41] A BODY THAT GOD CAN COME DOWN AND USE
[48:45] SUPERNATURALLY.
[48:47] Somebody that is a sinful and sinful
[48:49] flesh that he can change in a moment, in
[48:52] a twinkle OF AN EYE, NOT WAITING FOR A
[48:54] BODY CHANGE, BUT CHANGING THAT MAN AND
[48:57] WOMAN AS THEY'RE LIVING AND BEING an
[49:00] absence. abstract I can't even say the
[49:04] word an abstract I can't say it never
[49:06] mind
[49:09] &gt;&gt; but here we are we're standing in the
[49:13] presence of the almighty God
[49:16] &gt;&gt; right
[49:16] &gt;&gt; we don't have to worry about anything
[49:18] else he comes and lives INSIDE OF YOU
[49:21] HE'S NOT IN HEAVEN HE'S SP HE'S
[49:24] EVERYWHERE BUT HE WANTS TO PUT A PART OF
[49:27] HIM IN you
[49:28] &gt;&gt; he wants YOU TO BE MINIATURE GODS HE
[49:31] WANTS WANTS YOU TO TELL THE PEOPLE ABOUT
[49:33] THE WORD OF GOD. AND LISTEN, CHURCH, I
[49:35] don't want to get people up for uproar.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; But I'm going to tell you something.
[49:39] Brother Brandham, it's over for him.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah. All right.
[49:43] &gt;&gt; We have people saying, "Brother Brandon,
[49:45] BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, BROTHER BRANDHAM
[49:46] SAYS, "WHAT ABOUT YOU?"
[49:48] &gt;&gt; DID YOU EAT THE SAME BOOK?
[49:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO SAY, "I SAY THE
[49:54] BIBLE SAYS Jesus Christ is the same
[49:56] yesterday, today, AND FOREVER."
[49:58] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOT TO BE PERSONAL. IT WAS PERSONAL
[50:00] TO BROTHER WENDELL. IT'S PERSONAL TO
[50:02] BROTHER BRANDHAM. BUT SEE, IT HAS TO BE
[50:04] IMPERSONAL TO YOU.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT BEFORE YOU
[50:09] CAN GET UP OUT of that seat, you'll be
[50:10] healed.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO STAY WITH THE
[50:14] PATTERN. YOU GOT TO STAY WITH THE
[50:15] BLESSINGS. ANYTHING CONTRARY TO THE WORD
[50:18] OF GOD IS NOT GOING TO BE A BLESSING.
[50:21] It's going to make you cause yourself
[50:23] harm.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Okay. If you live into sin, it's going
[50:28] to take you farther away and you're not
[50:31] going to like it. But if we stay in the
[50:34] pattern, not under some because I am
[50:37] somebody.
[50:38] But the grace of God called you to be
[50:42] like Jesus.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yes, sir.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't condemn no one. HE GAVE
[50:48] EVERYBODY THE opportunity to come to the
[50:50] word.
[50:52] &gt;&gt; He loved them.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He loved them same ONES THAT HE
[50:56] WALKED BY AND didn't heal them. They had
[50:58] to pick up their own cross.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; But he went to THE ONE THE FATHER TOLD
[51:03] HIM TO GO TO. AND TODAY, GOD HAD COME TO
[51:06] A PEOPLE OUT OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF
[51:09] PEOPLE THAT'S ON THE EARTH. HE'S PASSED
[51:11] THEM TO COME TO YOU TO GIVE YOU ETERNAL
[51:14] LIFE AND BE A PART OF A BRIDE THAT YOU
[51:17] CAN LIVE FOREVER AND EVER AND GO TO
[51:20] HEAVEN AND BE A PART OF SOMETHING GREAT.
[51:22] AMEN.
[51:25] &gt;&gt; You're in the plan of God this morning,
[51:27] this evening. I mean,
[51:29] &gt;&gt; and in this place that we're living
[51:31] TODAY IS THE GREATEST PLACE TO START TO
[51:35] PROVE TO THE DEVIL THAT WE CAN LIVE.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[51:39] &gt;&gt; Like Christians.
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:45] So God planned a planned
[51:49] a pattern a way for us.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; But God created heaven and earth and the
[51:56] sea and all the seas. Divided the light
[51:59] and the darkness. He made morning day
[52:03] and evening night. Made all the beasts
[52:06] of the earth. Created man and female.
[52:09] Great plan of God.
[52:12] Did you understand? And he said all
[52:14] these others, but then right there at
[52:16] the moment, he's a great plan of God by
[52:19] what? Creating man and female.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SPECIAL,
[52:25] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[52:26] &gt;&gt; HE WENT DOWN INTO A RIB AND HE CALLED
[52:29] YOUR NAME. HE CALLED YOU TO COME FORTH.
[52:32] HE CALLED YOU TO COME THROUGH A PATTERN
[52:34] THAT GOD CAN MAKE SOMETHING good in your
[52:38] life.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; Okay? We need to quit thinking. We need
[52:43] to start believing from here.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Because when we believe from here,
[52:47] things move, things change,
[52:50] &gt;&gt; victory's coming,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:54] &gt;&gt; THROUGH ALL THE TRIALS THAT YOU GO
[52:55] THROUGH, LISTEN CHURCH, IF YOU'RE
[52:57] LISTENING THROUGH THE CHURCH AGES, IT
[53:00] SHOWS A PATTERN.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; EVERY CHURCH AGE MESSENGER STARTED FROM
[53:06] THE VERY BEGINNING WITH PAUL. THEY TOOK
[53:08] SOMETHING OUT OF PAUL'S MESSAGE AND
[53:11] BROUGHT A PEOPLE OUT FOR THEIR DAY.
[53:14] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; HE DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T CHANGE NOTHING.
[53:17] THEY DIDN'T ADD NOTHING. THEY STAYED
[53:19] WITH THE PATTERN OF GOD BECAUSE THE
[53:21] PROPHET OF GOD SAYS Paul was the man. HE
[53:26] WAS THE ONE. THE PATTERN COME FROM HIM.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; FOR THE CHURCH AGES, WE HAD TO HAVE A
[53:33] WORD THAT WAS IN PENTECOST. AND THAT
[53:35] PENTECOST WAS GOD'S WAY OF SHOWING us
[53:40] &gt;&gt; the true word, the true baptism of the
[53:43] Holy Ghost,
[53:44] &gt;&gt; how to be baptized, right? How to see
[53:46] God do things.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; Because he was creating a family.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; As I was telling the church this
[53:56] morning, there's three kinds of
[53:57] believers in every church.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; Which one are you?
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[54:03] Are you an unbeliever?
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Are you a makebeliever? Or are you the
[54:08] real believer?
[54:10] &gt;&gt; Because remember, God has anointed all
[54:14] three.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; Every teacher
[54:22] &gt;&gt; is anointed by God. False or good.
[54:27] Brother Anne says they asked brother
[54:29] says if
[54:32] is that anointing
[54:35] that comes does it fall on the unjust?
[54:37] He said absolutely. Bible talks about
[54:40] it. The rain falls on the unjust and the
[54:42] just.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; He goes the Holy Spirit
[54:47] anoints
[54:49] everyone.
[54:51] What? Everyone.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[54:55] It's a pattern.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; SATAN HAD A PATTERN HE HAS TO FOLLOW.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; HE CAN'T JUST COME AND TORMENT YOU EVERY
[55:03] moment in the twinkle of an eye if God
[55:05] didn't let him.
[55:06] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; He's there TO TRIM YOUR WOOD. HE'S THERE
[55:11] TO TRIM YOU UP TO GET YOU A PLACE TO SAY
[55:14] YES LORD OR NO GOD. BUT SEE, THERE'S
[55:17] SOMETHING DOWN INSIDE OF YOUR SOUL THAT
[55:19] IT GOES TO GOD. AND HE LET IT SIT THERE
[55:21] FOR MANY YEARS UNTIL IT COME FORTH. AND
[55:24] THEN THE WORD come and what did it do?
[55:26] It watered it and it came to life.
[55:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:31] &gt;&gt; And if God brings it to life, no man can
[55:33] TAKE IT OUT.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; NO MAN CAN TAKE YOU AWAY FROM GOD.
[55:38] THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS WORLD THAT CAN
[55:40] TAKE YOU AWAY FROM GOD. YOU ARE SEED
[55:43] FORMED IN the presence of God at one
[55:45] time. But that seed starts growing and
[55:48] it will produce exactly to the father,
[55:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:52] &gt;&gt; And who's your father? Jesus Christ.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; But this pattern has to be dealt with in
[55:59] your heart,
[56:01] &gt;&gt; you've got to make a decision. Am I
[56:03] going to stay with the word or I'm going
[56:05] to stay with what I think?
[56:06] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[56:07] &gt;&gt; When you think, that's when you get in
[56:09] trouble.
[56:10] That's when brother William gets in
[56:11] trouble when I think.
[56:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; You just ask my wife.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; When I think too hard,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; she tells me about it. Why? Cuz she's my
[56:21] partner.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; All right.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; She doesn't want me to say things that's
[56:27] not right.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Cuz she loves me.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So, how much more is a pastor
[56:34] to us
[56:36] &gt;&gt; if when he sees something going on?
[56:40] Some people say, "Well, just come to my
[56:41] house and tell me." Do you know there's
[56:43] other people having the same problems?
[56:46] The house of God is a correction, a a
[56:49] place of healing. It's a it's IT'S IT'S
[56:51] A HOSPITAL. IT'S A PLACE OF REHAB. It's
[56:55] for people that HAVE WENT THROUGH
[56:57] BATTLES AFTER BATTLES AND THEY'RE
[56:58] SCARRED. THEY'RE HURT FROM THE MIND.
[57:00] THEY'RE HURT IN THE BODY. THEY'RE HURT
[57:01] IN THE HEART AND YOU COME TO CHURCH FOR
[57:03] WHAT REASON? IT'S TO GET STRENGTH FROM
[57:06] ON HIGH BECAUSE YOU GOT TO GET BACK INTO
[57:08] THE PATTERN. WHEN YOUR MIND'S ALL
[57:10] PLUGGED UP, YOU CAN'T STAY ON THE PRO ON
[57:12] THE PROGRAM. YOU CAN'T STAY IN THE IN
[57:14] THE WAY OF GOD BECAUSE YOUR MIND MAKES
[57:16] YOU GO WONDERING THIS WAY. IT MAKES YOU
[57:18] WONDERING THIS WAY. IT MAKES YOU GO THIS
[57:20] WAY. YOU KNOW, WE'RE I'M SO SICK AND
[57:23] TIRED OF HAVING THE SHEETROCK PUT UP TO
[57:25] MAKE up fix my mess. ALL RIGHT.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; WHY CAN'T I STOP JUST A LITTLE LONGER
[57:30] AND MAKE THAT TUBE OF FIRE FIT
[57:33] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; PERFECTLY? SO WHEN THE SHECKROCK PUTS IT
[57:36] UP, THEY DON'T HAVE TO work so hard.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; And the painters don't have to work SO
[57:41] HARD. IF WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER,
[57:45] IT WILL BUILD THE HOUSE OF GOD. YOU ARE
[57:48] THE PART OF GOD THIS EVENING. GOD'S
[57:51] LIVING INSIDE OF YOU. YOU ARE THE HOUSE
[57:53] OF GOD THIS EVENING, CHURCH. YOU ARE THE
[57:56] BODY OF LIVING JESUS CHRIST. HE HAS TO
[57:58] HAVE ANOTHER BODY. HE CREATED A BODY TO
[58:01] COME WHEN HE WAS A LITTLE BABY BOY. BUT
[58:03] NOW HE'S NOT IN THAT BODY. HE'S IN THE
[58:05] BODY, BUT HE WANTS TO BE IN YOUR BODY,
[58:09] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[58:10] &gt;&gt; He wants TO MARRY A BRIDE. HE WANTS A
[58:12] MANY MANY MEMBER BRIDE WHERE HE CAN COME
[58:15] AND LIVE INSIDE OF THEM AND TAKE A HOLD
[58:18] OF THIS WORLD AND SAY, "I TOLD YOU,
[58:20] SATAN, YOU CAN'T TAKE MY CHILDREN from
[58:22] me."
[58:24] &gt;&gt; AND I HAVE ANOINTED YOUR DEVILS. I'VE
[58:26] ANOINTED YOUR PEOPLE, BUT THEY'RE JUST
[58:27] IN THE HANDS OF MY HANDS, and I can tell
[58:30] them what to do.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; THEY CAN'T DECEIVE MY CHILDREN CUZ MY
[58:36] CHILDREN IS A PART OF ME.
[58:38] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[58:39] NOBODY CAN TELL YOU YOUR CHILDREN DON'T
[58:41] LOOK LIKE YOU BECAUSE THEY look like
[58:42] you.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Of
[58:44] &gt;&gt; course, this one here looks like grandpa
[58:46] and grandma more than he does mom and
[58:47] daddy. But you know what? You got a good
[58:50] mom and grandpa.
[58:52] But see, YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND
[58:53] SOMETHING. WE'VE GOT TO GET THIS OUT OF
[58:56] THE WAY AND WE'VE got to work with this.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; All right. Okay.
[59:00] &gt;&gt; And when we work with this, then God can
[59:04] do something.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:08] Amen.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; Throw the pitchfork out and get a rake
[59:14] and say, "Lord, I need this."
[59:17] Every time the preacher preaches, "I
[59:18] need that.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, I need more of that.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. I need Oh, nope. That's for
[59:25] me, Brother Wendle."
[59:27] YOU GUYS SHOULD BE FIGHTING FOR THE
[59:30] RIGHTS of getting every word that
[59:31] proceeded out of the mouth of God up
[59:33] here.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:35] YOU SHOULD HAVE HIM RINGING WET EVERY
[59:37] SERVICE. YOU SHOULD BE PULLING ON HIM SO
[59:40] HARD BECAUSE WHY? YOU GOT A JOB TO DO,
[59:44] &gt;&gt; EVERY ONE OF YOU.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; AND THAT IS TO BE THE GREATEST MAN AND
[59:50] DAUGHTER OF GOD ON FACE OF THIS EARTH.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; And that is to be able to walk and say,
[59:54] "Satan, get behind me."
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Sickness comes. Get behind me, Satan.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; WELL, YOU'RE SICK, BROTHER. I AIN'T
[1:00:03] SICK. I'M healed in the name of Jesus.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; AND SWALLOW IT DOWN AND KEEP SWALLOWING
[1:00:09] IT AND KEEP GOING AND MARCHING ON AND
[1:00:12] STEPPING ON THOSE DEVILS. EVERY TIME
[1:00:14] THEY TALK, YOU KEEP ON STEPPING ON THEM
[1:00:16] BECAUSE YOU'RE IN THE PLAN OF GOD. YOU
[1:00:18] ARE CREATING A SPACE THAT YOU CAN LIVE
[1:00:22] ON.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU CONQUER THIS THIS MOUNTAIN, IF
[1:00:26] YOU CAN CONQUER THIS WORLD, the devil
[1:00:29] can't do nothing to you.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; All right? BUT WHEN THIS WORLD IS
[1:00:32] OVERWHELMED TO YOU, then you got to
[1:00:34] learn this is just a body that's going
[1:00:35] to burn one day
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; or it's going to go in rot. BUT THAT
[1:00:39] SOUL HAS TO TAKE CONTROL.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; BLESS THE LORD.
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; JESUS CONQUERED THE WORLD ALREADY.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Now he wants you to conquer yourself.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And when you conquer yourself,
[1:00:52] people are going to see something
[1:00:54] special. THEY MIGHT NOT understand it,
[1:00:57] but they're going to see something
[1:00:59] different. I've been working at a place
[1:01:01] called Safeway, a grocery store. Yeah,
[1:01:04] me
[1:01:06] a per I'm a clerk. That's my title,
[1:01:10] Brother Merl.
[1:01:12] I go into the back, I unload the truck,
[1:01:16] I drag, everybody uses the machines. I
[1:01:18] use the cart and I just grab it by by
[1:01:21] hand.
[1:01:23] And I pull that stuff into my cooler and
[1:01:26] I go back another almost 100 yards and
[1:01:29] grab another one and I come back and
[1:01:31] they said, "Why are you not using that?"
[1:01:32] "Because I'm faster than you guys with
[1:01:34] that thing on."
[1:01:37] They said, "No, you're not." I said,
[1:01:38] "You want to a bit?"
[1:01:41] They said, "Yeah, I blew them away,
[1:01:43] church.
[1:01:45] 55y old man tore them up."
[1:01:49] And look at me.
[1:01:51] Woo! who I'm losing weight doing it,
[1:01:53] too. It's a challenge, but you know
[1:01:56] what? It works.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; But the people,
[1:02:01] one lady in that place is Sister Sarah.
[1:02:05] SHE'S TOLD THE WHOLE PLACE I'm her
[1:02:06] pastor and she's proud of it. And
[1:02:09] they're all watching me like hawks.
[1:02:12] And I'm telling you something, my side
[1:02:14] of the produce, they love me.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; I'll walk around, they'll be cussing. I
[1:02:21] walk around and they all turn around.
[1:02:22] We're sorry. We're sorry, brother
[1:02:24] William. We're sorry. We're sorry. We,
[1:02:25] you know, we love you. We love you.
[1:02:27] We're sorry. We're sorry.
[1:02:33] The management
[1:02:36] wrote a letter. I'm the only one out of
[1:02:39] that store ever had a letter wrote to
[1:02:42] their to their uh big man saying William
[1:02:45] Smith
[1:02:47] does a fantastic job on the wet bar. He
[1:02:51] works we watched him for four and a half
[1:02:53] hours yesterday and he never stopped one
[1:02:56] time. He worked and he worked and he
[1:02:58] worked.
[1:03:01] Okay.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; The whole place is like
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; so the management's thinking about
[1:03:08] putting me in charge of the whole place
[1:03:12] spiritually.
[1:03:15] My side totally change atmosphere
[1:03:19] because when I come in I'm shaking their
[1:03:21] hands and
[1:03:24] you'll get fired doing this church.
[1:03:29] I've prayed for him out there in the
[1:03:31] middle of the store.
[1:03:34] &gt;&gt; All right. S I said, "What's wrong with
[1:03:35] you, sis?" She goes, "Oh, just having a
[1:03:38] bad day." So, you want me to pray for
[1:03:40] you? Yeah.
[1:03:42] I take my hat off and I pray right
[1:03:44] there.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; THE BOSSES ARE WATCHING ME GOING, "HE'S
[1:03:49] PRETTY BRAVE."
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; I could get fired for it. I don't care.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; Why? Because I know who I am. He gave me
[1:04:00] the job. He gave me another job. But I
[1:04:02] am going to shed THE LIGHT TO THOSE THAT
[1:04:05] ARE NEEDY. AND I WANT THEM SAVED. I WANT
[1:04:07] THAT WHOLE STORE SAVED AS LONG AS I'm
[1:04:10] going to be working there.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; MY BOSSES DON'T GIVE two raises a year.
[1:04:17] Never.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:04:19] I got a raise my first 90 days and then
[1:04:22] they gave me the max this last week
[1:04:24] before I left
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I KEPT MY NOSE IN THE BOOK. I
[1:04:34] get THERE IN THE MORNINGS. I WORK. I
[1:04:36] PUSH PLAY. I LISTEN TO THE MESSAGE OF
[1:04:38] THE HOUR. I WORSHIP GOD. WHEN I'M
[1:04:40] LISTENING TO THE MUSIC, I'M SINGING IN
[1:04:42] FRONT OF EVERYBODY THAT'S IN THAT PLACE.
[1:04:44] AS PEOPLE THAT COME AND ASK FOR
[1:04:46] SOMETHING, I TELL THEM WHERE IT'S AT. I
[1:04:47] GO GET IT. I work and work and work. All
[1:04:50] right. I'VE GOT PEOPLE THAT LIVE THERE
[1:04:53] COME UP TO me telling ME THEIR PROBLEMS
[1:04:56] AND I LOOK AT THEM. I SAYS, "I'VE GOT
[1:04:57] THE THE cure for it." How? Let me pray
[1:05:01] for you. I'VE PRAYED for people that's
[1:05:05] in there that COME INTO THE STORE AND
[1:05:08] PRAYED FOR THEM AND THEY left crying.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Thanking God.
[1:05:15] Me and the boys were talking one day and
[1:05:18] they were asking me questions and I was
[1:05:20] answering their questions. This woman
[1:05:21] comes up and goes, "I wish YOU'D QUIT
[1:05:24] TALKING ABOUT THAT GOD OF YOURS AND HELP
[1:05:26] ME FIND THE TOMATOES."
[1:05:29] She was standing right in front of the
[1:05:30] tomatoes.
[1:05:34] THE VERY NEXT WEEK, SHE COMES IN AND
[1:05:38] SHE'S COMING UP AND I SAID, "HOW ARE YOU
[1:05:39] DOING, MA'AM?" She goes, "I'm doing
[1:05:41] okay." I said, "I'm so glad you made my
[1:05:44] whole day." She goes, "I did?" I said,
[1:05:47] "Absolutely.
[1:05:49] I love the Lord Jesus just because of
[1:05:52] you." AND SHE, THE SAME WOMAN SAYS, "OH
[1:05:55] MY GOODNESS, you're a Christian. I love
[1:05:58] God, too.
[1:06:04] I COULD HAVE HATED HER GUTS. I COULD
[1:06:06] HAVE NEVER DONE NOTHING TO HER. BUT I
[1:06:08] CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE AND BRING HER INTO
[1:06:10] GOD BY BEING KIND TO HER.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; NOW SHE COMES IN. She doesn't call me by
[1:06:17] my name. She calls me by my last name.
[1:06:19] Hello Mr. Smith, pastor.
[1:06:24] Haircut shorter than yours.
[1:06:28] Mean looking thing.
[1:06:31] She comes in. First thing she comes is
[1:06:34] Mr. Smith here today. I've got to tell
[1:06:35] him what my whole day
[1:06:40] I'm blown away.
[1:06:44] But I told I told my wife, I says,
[1:06:48] "We're here. We're going to change
[1:06:50] lives."
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; We have the ministry. We need to change
[1:06:55] lives.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; We've got to tear this place apart by
[1:06:58] love.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:01] We've got a man that come to church,
[1:07:04] tattoos all the way up to his neck, all
[1:07:06] the way up to here like this. He wants
[1:07:08] to be baptized.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Was in the in the Catholic church for
[1:07:14] years. He wants to be baptized the right
[1:07:17] way.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; It's Jesus
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; in
[1:07:24] Bible form human.
[1:07:29] Some people don't read this. Too many
[1:07:32] people, false doctrine says that this is
[1:07:34] not real.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Quit arguing with them.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT REAL UNLESS IT'S
[1:07:42] IN A HUMAN BEING.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; It's just a BUNCH OF WORDS.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU EAT THE BOOK. YOU BECOME THE
[1:07:48] BIBLE. THEY SEE THE BIBLE LIVING INSIDE
[1:07:50] OF YOU. THEY'LL ASK QUESTIONS.
[1:07:57] The whole store
[1:08:01] looks up to me.
[1:08:05] It's a lot of pressure.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; But I love it.
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:08:11] Doesn't matter what side of the store
[1:08:12] I'm at, they're cussing. Instantly they
[1:08:15] stop
[1:08:19] and the religious part comes out. Well,
[1:08:21] praise the Lord. We're so glad that
[1:08:23] you're here.
[1:08:26] One time I told him, I says, "Yeah, to
[1:08:27] keep you in check." And he goes, "Amen."
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; But see, we got to get into a pattern. I
[1:08:35] didn't know why I put this in there, but
[1:08:37] give you a little example what's
[1:08:38] happening to Brother William and Sister
[1:08:40] Sharon.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And we're enjoying it.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Let's get back on the message.
[1:08:48] Oh, mercy sakes.
[1:08:51] I got other people that like me, too.
[1:08:53] Like you guys, I got 14 people that
[1:08:55] comes to church every service and they
[1:08:57] just love me to death. They laugh just
[1:09:00] with Sharon all the time, shaking their
[1:09:01] heads.
[1:09:04] But see, part of a pattern, God forms
[1:09:08] man from the dust of the earth because a
[1:09:11] living soul made woman from man.
[1:09:18] Because what see what happens here? God
[1:09:20] when he created man in his own image, he
[1:09:23] was male and female.
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; He was a perfect
[1:09:31] man.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; But when he laid him down and pulled out
[1:09:37] that rib,
[1:09:41] that woman part
[1:09:44] is a helpmate.
[1:09:47] When Jesus was on that cross, your
[1:09:50] cross, and that spear went into that
[1:09:53] side and the blood came out, what was he
[1:09:56] doing?
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; He was letting his life pour out on the
[1:10:01] ground to every seed that proceedth out
[1:10:04] of the mouth of God, predestinated seed
[1:10:09] would be covered of his blood.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Okay? And when the word would come po
[1:10:15] forth, that woman wakes up,
[1:10:20] the other part of that man,
[1:10:24] and Adam called it woman.
[1:10:27] He loved her. They did things together.
[1:10:31] So what does God do? He creates a body
[1:10:35] so he can come and live in it. The God
[1:10:38] of heaven left his throne and get into A
[1:10:41] BODY. THE SPIRIT OF THAT BODY WAS JESUS
[1:10:45] CHRIST, the Godhead bodily. THE FLESH
[1:10:49] WAS A SACRIFICE FOR YOU AND ME SO THAT
[1:10:53] YOU AND I can join him
[1:10:57] as a bride.
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; So now he has a many brothers and
[1:11:02] sisters, but a body
[1:11:06] that he's marrying, a church.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Wow. YEAH.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; AND SO NOW he
[1:11:12] is making this house
[1:11:15] his wife the word and he's endoring her
[1:11:21] and he's making her
[1:11:24] exactly
[1:11:26] the mind way back yonder.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; He wanted a wife to be this.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah. AND IT TOOK SEVEN CHURCH AGE
[1:11:37] people to make this body.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; So that he can marry the church.
[1:11:49] Same thing with this man.
[1:11:53] He was lonely.
[1:11:56] GOD IN HEAVEN WAS LONELY. CHURCH.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:12:01] He wanted somebody to fellowship. He
[1:12:05] didn't want just angels just bowing down
[1:12:08] to
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; But he wanted a people that would come
[1:12:14] to him and say, "Father, I need you this
[1:12:17] morning."
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; I thank you for the breath that I take
[1:12:22] every morning.
[1:12:24] Thank you for going to work WITH ME,
[1:12:26] LORD.
[1:12:29] BECAUSE AS YOU'RE WORSHIPING GOD, YOU'RE
[1:12:31] IN THE PATTERN.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; OKAY?
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; When we building houses,
[1:12:38] we stand there and we build a foundation
[1:12:40] first,
[1:12:42] but before any mud or any steel or any
[1:12:45] wood, WE'VE GOT TO TEST THE GROUND TO
[1:12:48] MAKE SURE THAT THAT GROUND IS GOING TO
[1:12:51] HOLD THE FOUNDATION.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; SURE. OKAY.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; YES. And if it can't, they dig deep
[1:12:57] until THEY GET ON A SOLID ROCK AND THEY
[1:13:01] DRILL INTO IT AND THEY PUT A FOUNDATION
[1:13:04] DOWN SO THAT FOUNDATION WILL NOT MISS OR
[1:13:07] SLIP OR BREAK. AND WHEN THAT FOUNDATION
[1:13:11] IS BUILT,
[1:13:14] you start building a house.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:13:19] GOD COME DOWN ONE day
[1:13:23] in A LITTLE BODY NAMED JESUS AND HE
[1:13:26] WANTED THAT BODY TO BE THE FOUNDATION OF
[1:13:29] THE CHURCH. AND HE MADE SURE THAT THAT
[1:13:33] BODY WAS GOING TO HOLD EVERY MAN AND
[1:13:37] EVERY WOMAN OF GOD IN A PLACE WHERE THEY
[1:13:40] can be secure
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; forever more.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Okay. AMEN. THROUGH ANY TRIAL, THROUGH
[1:13:47] ANY PAIN, THROUGH ANYTHING THAT EVER
[1:13:50] HAPPENS, YOU HAVE AN ANCHOR. YOU HAVE A
[1:13:53] FOUNDATION. AND GOD, HE IS BUILDING THE
[1:13:56] HOUSE. HE'S TAKING YOU LUMBER. HE'S
[1:14:00] TAKING YOU SHINGLES. HE'S TAKING YOU
[1:14:03] WINDOWS. HE'S TAKING YOU THIS AND THAT.
[1:14:06] AND HE IS MAKING A BODY. AND HE'S
[1:14:09] STAYING WITH THE PATTERN. HE'S GOT A
[1:14:11] PATTERN. AND HE'S GOING TO HAVE A BRIDE
[1:14:14] SPOTLESS,
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; WHEN I GRAB A 2X4, IT DOESN'T SAY,
[1:14:22] "DON'T CUT ME. DON'T CUT ME." IT DOESN'T
[1:14:25] HAVE NOTHING TO SAY. I CUT IT EXACTLY
[1:14:28] THE LENGTH I NEED AND I PLACE IT IN THE
[1:14:30] WALL.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; AND THAT PIECE MEANS SOMETHING IN THAT
[1:14:37] WALL. YEAH,
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; THOSE STUDS THERE WASN'T THERE. THAT
[1:14:40] WALL WOULD FALL.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; YES,
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; THOSE TILES WOULD FALL IF SOMETHING
[1:14:47] WASN'T TIED RIGHT UP THERE.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; TRUE.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; SO GOD LETS THE DEVIL COME AND HE BEATS
[1:14:55] ON YOU. WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S making a
[1:14:58] house.
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; The great pattern of God.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. a salvation
[1:15:07] pattern,
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; a redemption pattern. IT'S GOT HEALING
[1:15:12] IN IT. IT'S GOT SALVATION IN IT. IT'S
[1:15:15] GOT JOY IN IT. IT'S GOT LOVE IN IT. IT'S
[1:15:18] GOT FAITH IN IT. IT'S GOT EVERYTHING YOU
[1:15:21] NEED, CHURCH.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; That's why it's so important when them
[1:15:26] doors open in your home, go to church.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:34] God had a pattern in the Bible to
[1:15:36] fulfill.
[1:15:39] &gt;&gt; Noah,
[1:15:42] it was little old Noah.
[1:15:46] He didn't know that HE WAS GOING TO GO
[1:15:47] THROUGH TRIALS FOR 125 YEARS.
[1:15:52] AS SOON AS HE SAID GOD TOLD HIM TO BUILD
[1:15:54] A BOAT AND HE STARTED WITH A BLUEPRINTS
[1:15:57] AND PEOPLE SAW THAT BLUEPRINTS, THEY
[1:15:59] WERE LAUGHING AT HIM. THEY WERE MAKING
[1:16:01] FUN OF HIM, BUT HE STAYED TRUE TO THE
[1:16:03] BLUEPRINT AND BUILT A BOAT.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; And that boat took eight people across
[1:16:10] and two pair of animals all the way
[1:16:12] across until 40 days and 40 nights of
[1:16:16] rain.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; And when it landed on a rock, wherever
[1:16:22] it's at, and wherever it is it today, I
[1:16:24] don't know. But I'm going to TELL YOU
[1:16:25] SOMETHING.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; MY BIBLE shows it's the truth. Yeah.
[1:16:29] Yeah. Amen.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; He built a boat.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; And he kept telling him, "You better get
[1:16:37] on the boat."
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; YOUR JOB IS TO TELL THE PEOPLE TO GET IN
[1:16:43] WHILE THEY HAVE TIME TODAY.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; GET IN WHAT? JESUS CHRIST,
[1:16:50] the hope of glory.
[1:16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Abraham had a plan.
[1:16:59] He was GOING TO BE A FATHER OF MANY
[1:17:01] NATIONS. HE WAS GOING TO HAVE CHILDREN
[1:17:04] OF CHILDRENS OF CHILDRENS OF CHILDREN.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; HE WENT THROUGH THE HARD TIMES. HE WENT
[1:17:12] THROUGH THOSE THINGS. HE
[1:17:15] HE DISOBEYED GOD AND TOOK HIS NEPHEW AND
[1:17:17] THE FATHER WITH HIM. AND WHAT HAPPENED?
[1:17:19] GOD DIDN'T TALK TO HIM UNTIL HE GOT RID
[1:17:21] OF IT AND GOT BACK ON THE PLAN. AND WHEN
[1:17:24] HE GOT ON THE PLAN, AS SOON AS THEY WERE
[1:17:26] GONE, HE SHOWED THEM EXACTLY WHERE TO
[1:17:28] GO.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE STRUGGLING TONIGHT, CHURCH, IF
[1:17:32] YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE JUST HITTING A
[1:17:33] WALL, COME BACK TO THE ORIGINAL WORD.
[1:17:36] COME BACK AND GIVE YOUR LIFE TO JESUS
[1:17:39] CHRIST. QUIT BEING SO SCARED TO COME
[1:17:41] DOWN TO THE ALTAR BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS
[1:17:44] making you not come because he's telling
[1:17:45] you you're not worthy enough.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; IF YOU WASN'T WORTHY ENOUGH, HE WOULDN'T
[1:17:49] HAVE DIED ON CALVARY FOR YOU. AMEN.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; YES.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; And brother Rand says, HE SAYS, "YES,
[1:17:56] THAT WAS A JEWISH rel uh uh way, BUT HE
[1:17:59] SAYS IT WORKS FOR AMERICA, SO WE'RE
[1:18:00] GOING TO KEEP IT GOING."
[1:18:05] I thank God for this morning.
[1:18:09] I saw this BIG OLD DARK CLOUD COME INTO
[1:18:11] THE building and all of a sudden I seen
[1:18:13] these arms going down and hitting the
[1:18:15] people. And those people this morning
[1:18:17] with those five people when it hit them,
[1:18:20] they would go,
[1:18:25] I've never called that out before. When
[1:18:26] I called it out this morning, they was
[1:18:28] coming running with tears down their
[1:18:30] face. THEY GOT VICTORY THIS MORNING
[1:18:33] BECAUSE it
[1:18:35] it came to the right atmosphere.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; THEY GOT DELIVERED THIS MORNING. WHY?
[1:18:41] BECAUSE SOMEBODY CARED ENOUGH TO TELL
[1:18:43] THE PEOPLE. AND IF YOU REJECT THE WORD
[1:18:47] OF GOD THROUGH THE PASTOR SAYING THERE'S
[1:18:49] A SPIRIT, YOU NEED TO COME TO THE ALTAR.
[1:18:52] EVEN YOU DON'T THINK IT'S YOU, COME TO
[1:18:54] THE ALTAR ANYWAY AND CRY OUT TO GOD AND
[1:18:56] SAY, "FATHER, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ME,
[1:18:57] BUT IF IT'S ME, THEN HELP ME, GOD. BUT
[1:19:00] IF IT'S MY BROTHER, IT'S MY SISTER.
[1:19:02] LORD, LET ME PLEASE LET ME BLEED FOR
[1:19:04] THEM.
[1:19:06] FILL THE ALTAR UP WITH PRAISE AND WATCH
[1:19:09] GOD TAKE OVER."
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. YOU WANT A REAL BAPTISM OF THE
[1:19:15] HOLY GHOST? AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
[1:19:17] SPEAKING IN TONGUES. I'M TALKING ABOUT A
[1:19:19] VICTORY.
[1:19:21] &gt;&gt; OH, saints of God, I think we all need a
[1:19:23] victory march once in a while.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; BUT WE GET OFF THE PATTERN
[1:19:29] BECAUSE WE ARE SOMEBODY.
[1:19:32] WE'RE NOTHING EXCEPT CHRIST IN US.
[1:19:36] CHRIST WENT TO THE HE WENT THERE AND
[1:19:38] PRAYED AND ASKED GOD TO LET THAT CUP
[1:19:40] PASS.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; YEAH. HE GOT ON HIS KNEES AND CRIED OUT
[1:19:43] AND SAY, "OH LORD, IF THIS COULD PASS,
[1:19:45] LET IT PASS."
[1:19:47] BUT WHAT WAS HE THINKING? HE WAS
[1:19:49] THINKING ABOUT YOU,
[1:19:51] YOU HOPELESS PEOPLE. HE WAS LOOKING AT
[1:19:54] YOU AND ME, HOPELESS, without somebody
[1:19:57] coming and taking your sins.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "FATHER, NEVER ALAS,
[1:20:05] I'll go."
[1:20:07] FROM THAT POINT, HE DIED RIGHT THERE FOR
[1:20:09] YOU.
[1:20:11] But now he had to fulfill it.
[1:20:14] Are we ready to fulfill our journey?
[1:20:17] Are we going to get off our little tush
[1:20:20] and start acting like real Christians
[1:20:22] and staying with the word of God?
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; I don't want to see him with more gray
[1:20:29] hairs next time I come.
[1:20:33] He's younger than me by three days.
[1:20:38] But I'm being honest.
[1:20:42] We get we think we know the message of
[1:20:44] the hour and that's all we need. We
[1:20:46] don't need nothing else
[1:20:48] that's going to judge us one day. Stay
[1:20:51] with the pattern.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Moses
[1:20:57] in the pattern.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; What was he?
[1:21:00] He was a deliverer when he was born.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; HE HAD A JOB to do, BUT HE STARTED ONE
[1:21:06] DAY too soon.
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He ran like a little scared little
[1:21:10] boy. Ran out in the wilderness.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh didn't take him out at the end
[1:21:14] of the thing and hand him a stick and
[1:21:16] hand him some water and hand him some
[1:21:18] food and say, "There's your kingdom."
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; No, he ran because he didn't have a
[1:21:23] kingdom no more because he'd killed AN
[1:21:25] EGYPTIAN.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; HE HAD IT ALREADY IN his hands.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; But he RAN BECAUSE HE WAS SCARED THAT
[1:21:31] BECAUSE PHARAOH WAS GOING TO KILL HIM.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; So he gets out there and God GIVES HIM A
[1:21:35] WIFE THAT FIGHTS WITH HIM.
[1:21:37] THANK God I didn't get one of them.
[1:21:43] Guess who is his first
[1:21:46] people that he had to
[1:21:49] be a shepherd, too. It wasn't even
[1:21:50] people. It was a four-legged bath.
[1:21:54] Stinky,
[1:21:58] messy,
[1:21:59] they eat everything.
[1:22:02] They b all the time.
[1:22:05] God was building character,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; all right,
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; in his pattern,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; all right,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; for a deliverer.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; All right,
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; he had to learn how to take care of his
[1:22:13] father-in-law's sheep,
[1:22:16] he had to have the ability to have
[1:22:20] something that he knows that he could be
[1:22:22] a shepherd.
[1:22:24] And when he saw that burning fire up
[1:22:26] there in the mountain that that tree was
[1:22:29] not being burned up, it made him want to
[1:22:32] know what in the world is on God's
[1:22:34] mountain.
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; And there was a pool.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Do you feel a pool?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; He goes up there and God speaks to him
[1:22:44] and says, "Take your shoes off. You're
[1:22:45] on holy ground."
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; And God speaks to him. But see, Moses
[1:22:49] had to see a sign.
[1:22:53] because he was scared. I can't DO IT. I
[1:22:55] CAN'T TALK. I CAN'T DO I CAN'T CAN CAN'T
[1:22:57] CAN. WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN'T DO
[1:22:59] IT. BUT YOU CAN WITH CHRIST.
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; He said, "Moses, put your hand
[1:23:06] in your side." And he puts it in. He
[1:23:07] rings it out in his leprosy.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; He said, HE SAID, "MOSES, put it back in
[1:23:12] your came back and it was just fine." I
[1:23:15] love him.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; What is it? God's showing him
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; that he was God.
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; And if I can change your hand to be
[1:23:24] leper and I can make your hand well, I
[1:23:27] can get you to be a deliverer.
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; IF GOD CAN HEAL YOUR BODY, THEN HE can
[1:23:32] make you be sons and daughters of God.
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; He just needs a willing vessel to let
[1:23:39] him have control.
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; And so what did he do? Moses, pick up
[1:23:46] your stick. Throw it on the floor. Goes
[1:23:50] into a stank.
[1:23:52] God didn't pick it up.
[1:23:55] He wanted Moses to pick it up. HE WANTED
[1:23:58] TO SHOW MOSES THAT HE HAD THE POWER TO
[1:24:00] CHANGE THINGS.
[1:24:02] HE REACHED DOWN THERE AND HE GRABS THAT
[1:24:04] SNAKE AND IT CAME BACK WITH WHAT? Not a
[1:24:07] snake.
[1:24:09] The stick that was in his hand.
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Has a shepherd man.
[1:24:16] Moses was changed that day forward. Now
[1:24:19] he was in the commission that he needs
[1:24:21] to be in.
[1:24:23] And the Bible says he went down there
[1:24:25] and he conquered
[1:24:27] the Egyptians.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; By a stick in his hand.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; He was in the pattern. See, he got
[1:24:35] himself in the word and he went forward.
[1:24:39] Little Moses's get into the word
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; and go forward and conquer your enemy.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Many men and many women has plans today,
[1:24:54] but you have to figure out where your
[1:24:56] plan is.
[1:24:59] Brother Brandham realized who he was and
[1:25:02] he manifested it. He was Malachi 4.
[1:25:08] But are you a part of Malachi 4? You're
[1:25:10] in there.
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; The children
[1:25:15] got their hearts turned towards what?
[1:25:19] The word.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; You become the word when you eat the
[1:25:26] book.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; You putting it into here, it drops down
[1:25:30] to here. And now you're manifesting what
[1:25:34] you eat.
[1:25:37] Brother Brandham never brought us to
[1:25:39] himself.
[1:25:41] Did you know that?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; How many people know that?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Why do you know it? Because you read the
[1:25:48] book. You're reading the books. You're
[1:25:50] listening to the tapes.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; So, Brother William, I if I am I going
[1:25:57] to hell if I sin? No.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; You're going to hell if you don't
[1:26:05] believe.
[1:26:07] But if you sin, you have an alien. You
[1:26:09] have the father that'll shed his blood
[1:26:11] upon you when you ask him forgiveness.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; That settles it.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; But if you love God, you'll try not to
[1:26:21] do those things.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Because now you're staying in the
[1:26:24] pattern. You're building the house.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:26:28] &gt;&gt; You're building your character to match
[1:26:32] Christ.
[1:26:34] You're dying out every day because why?
[1:26:36] You want to stay in the pattern.
[1:26:39] You're wanting to stay in that
[1:26:40] blueprint.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; I want to be holy. I want to be
[1:26:45] blameless. I want the joy. I want the
[1:26:49] salvation.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; I want to be healed.
[1:26:54] I want the faith. I want the virtue. I
[1:26:56] want the knowledge. I want the
[1:26:58] temperance. I want the brotherly love,
[1:26:59] the brotherly kindness. I want the love
[1:27:02] capstone come upon me
[1:27:06] to CHANGE THIS BODY IN A MOMENT, in a
[1:27:09] twinkle of an eye. I NEED THIS HOUSE TO
[1:27:14] LOOK LIKE JESUS.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Come on.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; And the only way we're going to do it,
[1:27:21] CHURCH, IS TO GET INTO THE WORD OF GOD
[1:27:23] YOURSELF, NOT YOUR PASTOR. YOUR PASTOR
[1:27:26] WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH WHAT YOU READ AND
[1:27:28] HELP YOU UNDERSTAND. BUT YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:27:31] READ THE BOOK,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; And then you'll be in the plan.
[1:27:39] The great foundation of Christ Jesus
[1:27:42] part is in the plans of God. Pentecost
[1:27:46] is the plans of God. The seven church
[1:27:50] haes come out. Great message of the hour
[1:27:54] is a part of the great pattern OF GOD.
[1:27:57] THE LIFE OF GOD IS IN THE message
[1:28:02] and he wants you to have that same life.
[1:28:06] So he's taking a part of him and putting
[1:28:08] it into you. What is it? It's him. The
[1:28:14] fullness of God. Brother says it's a
[1:28:16] teaspoon of of the sea. You've got the
[1:28:18] sea in your in a teaspoon. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; But that's just that's just a example.
[1:28:26] But if you got the Holy Ghost, you got
[1:28:27] him in you, the fullness
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; of the Godhead bodily in you.
[1:28:33] And if you got it, you got it. You got
[1:28:35] it. You got it. You got it. Then you are
[1:28:38] the bride
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Then what is he doing? He's making you
[1:28:44] be a part of the bride. He's making you
[1:28:47] that sleepy one over there in the bride.
[1:28:48] He's making these others in in the
[1:28:50] bride. He's making these over here in
[1:28:51] the bride. What is he doing? And he's
[1:28:53] going over here and he's making this in
[1:28:54] the bride. He's making this part of the
[1:28:55] bride. What is he doing? He's changing
[1:28:57] you.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; Changing you.
[1:29:03] Because why? He wants to marry you.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; OH, GLORY TO GOD. THAT MAKES ME FEEL
[1:29:11] GOOD THAT YOU AND I ARE GOING TO GET
[1:29:14] MARRIED TO GOD IN A union
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; of redemption.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; THE GLORY OF GOD COMING INTO US. WHAT IS
[1:29:24] IT?
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; It's the plan.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; Of your salvation,
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; okay?
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; The hope of glory, the life of Jesus
[1:29:37] Christ in you. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; What a God we serve, church.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; You are so much a part of the pattern of
[1:29:49] God.
[1:29:52] Remember the things I just wrote down
[1:29:53] off of off of messages that I just took
[1:29:56] my thoughts and wrote them down.
[1:30:00] I don't care what people called me. That
[1:30:04] don't mean a thing to me. The only thing
[1:30:08] that I want to do is know this that I
[1:30:13] have been dead and my life is hidden in
[1:30:17] Christ
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; through God and sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:30:22] that when he calls from among the dead,
[1:30:27] I will answer.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. on that day
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; buried bury me in Christ for this that
[1:30:35] our in Christ will God bring with him at
[1:30:39] that day.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; This is the pattern. So what do we need
[1:30:48] to do, brother William? Get into Christ.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; How do you get into Christ? Right here.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; That's how you get into Christ. Yes,
[1:30:58] sir.
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; You mean I don't have to go to college,
[1:31:01] brother Merl?
[1:31:04] I mean, I don't have to go to your house
[1:31:05] and you teach me how to how to be in
[1:31:08] Christ?
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Do I have to act like you, brother
[1:31:15] Mitch, to be in Christ?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; No. He wants you to be yourself.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Eat the book.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Eat the book. Hallelujah.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; And become
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; in Jesus Christ.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; How do we get in Christ? By one spirit,
[1:31:42] we are all baptized in one body and
[1:31:45] become fellow citizens of the kingdom of
[1:31:49] God. We profess to be pilgrims and
[1:31:53] strangers on this earth anymore. Not
[1:31:57] seeking those worldly things, but
[1:31:59] looking for the coming of the blessed
[1:32:03] king to take over and dominion from sea
[1:32:07] to boundless sea when he comes in his
[1:32:12] glory. Certainly he looks for his coming
[1:32:17] and then no doubt in my mind but that's
[1:32:21] what Jesus had in his mind when he was
[1:32:24] here on earth was that infidelity of
[1:32:29] God's eternal
[1:32:31] word.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. Praise the Lord.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:42] You
[1:32:44] become
[1:32:47] the word.
[1:32:48] &gt;&gt; It's good. Okay. All right.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; You
[1:32:54] become
[1:32:56] a miniature
[1:32:58] creator.
[1:33:00] What do you mean, brother William?
[1:33:03] The Bible says, "Lay hands on the sick
[1:33:05] and they shall recover. And if they have
[1:33:07] any sins, they are what?
[1:33:10] forgiven.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Your hand
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; because he's in you.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; The healer's in you.
[1:33:21] It goes from here through your hand and
[1:33:23] it heals that person and it plus it
[1:33:26] forgives it.
[1:33:28] That's that miniature God.
[1:33:33] You walk down the street and there's
[1:33:34] somebody laying there and God puts it on
[1:33:36] you. You can lay hands on that person
[1:33:38] and raise them from the dead,
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; but you got to know who you are.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; And the only way you norally going to
[1:33:46] know where you are is being in the
[1:33:48] blueprint
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; and follow the plan.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; All right? And the plan of salvation
[1:33:57] is under a lot of tribulations,
[1:34:00] lot of suffering,
[1:34:02] lot of pain,
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; but it's going to be worth it all.
[1:34:11] We've got to get a place in our lives
[1:34:15] that Brother William is nothing without
[1:34:20] Christ.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. My life is nothing but a
[1:34:25] vapor.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; But in Christ, I'm a son.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; If you're in Christ, your sons and
[1:34:35] daughters are what? God.
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; And then no doubt in my mind,
[1:34:45] no doubt. He said
[1:34:49] that prophet knew where he was standing.
[1:34:53] Do you know where you're standing this
[1:34:55] morning
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; or this evening? Are you struggling hard
[1:34:59] to just be a Christian?
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; If you are, there's something wrong
[1:35:07] now through your trials. I understand.
[1:35:10] But you should have no doubt in the
[1:35:12] world who you are
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; You should know that you're sons and
[1:35:17] daughters of God.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Okay? It doesn't matter what comes.
[1:35:21] Brother Brandham was a man of God, but
[1:35:23] he was sick. And what blows me away, it
[1:35:26] it was a Baptist preacher that prayed
[1:35:29] for him. He believed in healing. And he
[1:35:32] laid his hands on HIM AND HE PRAYED A
[1:35:34] SIMPLE PRAYER. And brother Brham had to
[1:35:38] come in the pattern of that prayer. And
[1:35:40] when he came IN THE PATTERN OF THAT
[1:35:42] PRAYER, the results come that he was
[1:35:45] healed.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:35:51] So, how much more about you,
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; gay,
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; brother Michael?
[1:35:59] Brother
[1:36:01] Kobe,
[1:36:03] you've got to know who you are as a
[1:36:05] minister.
[1:36:10] You're just as much a part of the
[1:36:12] ministry THAT ANYBODY ELSE IS. DON'T LET
[1:36:14] THEM TELL YOU ANY DIFFERENT.
[1:36:17] Because if not, HE WOULDN'T HAVE YOU
[1:36:19] PREACH IT.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; You stand IN THE PRESENCE OF GOD AND
[1:36:24] SAY, "LORD, WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO DO,
[1:36:27] I'LL DO. I'LL PREACH WHEREVER YOU WANT
[1:36:29] ME TO PREACH." AND YOU GO UP THERE WITH
[1:36:31] CONFIDENCE IN THE WORD OF GOD. AND YOU
[1:36:33] PREACH IT UNADULTERATED. AND YOU PREACH
[1:36:35] EVERY DEVIL OUT OF HELL. YOU PREACH THEM
[1:36:38] BACK INTO HELL. YOU PULL THEM BACK OUT.
[1:36:39] YOU SMACK THEM A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND
[1:36:41] YOU THROW THEM BACK IN THERE. SHOW THEM
[1:36:43] WHO HAS THE MUSCLES.
[1:36:47] YOU'VE GOT TO RING HIS NECK AROUND A
[1:36:50] LITTLE BIT.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; There you go. All right. YES, SIR.
[1:36:52] &gt;&gt; GET HIM UNCOMFORTABLE AND HE'LL STAY
[1:36:54] AWAY from your ministry and he will
[1:36:56] leave you alone.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; WHEN BROTHER BRANDON WAS STANDING THERE,
[1:37:00] THERE WAS DEVILS HAULING AT ONE ANOTHER.
[1:37:02] I NEED YOUR HELP. I NEED YOUR HELP. HE'S
[1:37:03] GOING TO CAST ME OUT. WHO IS GOING TO
[1:37:05] CAST HIM OUT? BROTHER BRANDHAM was
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; and you got the same gift.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Because he's in you. Okay.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; You have the right to tell the devil to
[1:37:18] get back.
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You can grab that thing. HE'S JUST THIS
[1:37:22] RIGHT HERE. You fold this up. This is
[1:37:24] him. YOU SHAKE HIM UP. SAID, "GET OUT OF
[1:37:27] HERE."
[1:37:30] FOLD HIS SHOULDERS TOGETHER, BEND HIM
[1:37:32] OVER, AND THROW HIM BACK INTO HELL
[1:37:34] BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT to
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; if you're in the pattern.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:37:46] Colossians 2 9-11 it says for in him
[1:37:49] dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead
[1:37:52] bodily and ye are complete in him IF
[1:37:56] YOU'RE COMPLETE IN HIM SPEAK THE WORD
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; okay
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; and it has to come to pass
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; which is the head of all principalities
[1:38:07] and powers and whom also ye are
[1:38:11] circumcised with the circumcision made
[1:38:14] without hands and putting off the body
[1:38:17] of the sin of the flesh, but circumcised
[1:38:20] of Christ.
[1:38:22] Oh, hallelujah, church. I don't know
[1:38:24] about you, BUT I FEEL RELIGIOUS NOW. I
[1:38:26] DON'T CARE ABOUT SATAN NO MORE. I DON'T
[1:38:29] CARE WHAT HE CAN DO. I CARE WHAT GOD CAN
[1:38:32] DO. AND IF I PUT MY TRUST IN HIM AND I
[1:38:35] SERVE HIM AND I CALL UPON HIM, HE'S
[1:38:38] GOING TO FIGHT FOR ME. HE'LL FIGHT FOR
[1:38:40] YOU. HE'LL FIGHT FOR YOUR CHILDREN.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid, church.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THAT ANOINTING FALLS ON THE
[1:38:50] UNJUST AND THE JUST.
[1:38:52] &gt;&gt; YOU MAMAS ARE TEACHERS. BE NOT A FALSE
[1:38:56] TEACHER. BE A MAMA OF THE WORD OF GOD
[1:38:59] AND TEACH YOUR CHILDREN HOW TO BE
[1:39:00] children of the living God when they're
[1:39:02] young and they'll serve God when they're
[1:39:04] older.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:39:08] YOU DADDIES, BE A PREACHER IN YOUR HOME.
[1:39:12] SHOW THE LOVE OF GOD IN YOUR LIFE WITH
[1:39:15] YOUR CHILDREN.
[1:39:17] When you come home, GET OFF YOUR
[1:39:18] STINKING PHONE AND PLAY WITH YOUR
[1:39:20] CHILDREN. DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR
[1:39:22] CHILDREN CUZ somebody's going to get
[1:39:23] your children if you don't.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE PATTERN.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO STAY IN THE PATTERN OF GOD
[1:39:31] OR YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A BUNCH OF
[1:39:33] BASTARD CHILDREN OUT THERE SOMEDAY.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THERE'S MANY CHILDREN IN THE
[1:39:38] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR ARE LEAVING BECAUSE
[1:39:40] THEY DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
[1:39:42] BECAUSE IT'S PUSHING BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:39:44] DOWN THEIR STINKING THROATS.
[1:39:48] I love Brother Brown with all my heart.
[1:39:50] I believe this message WITH ALL MY
[1:39:51] HEART. HE'S MY PROPHET, BUT WHAT ABOUT
[1:39:53] ME? Did I eat the book?
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID, "WHO CARES? HE'S
[1:40:04] DEAD. HE WANTS YOU TO SAY JESUS CHRIST.
[1:40:07] MOST OF THE THINGS HE'S EVER SAID WAS
[1:40:08] RIGHT out of the scripture,
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; It's time
[1:40:17] to be the preacher of yourself
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; and produce the word out of your own
[1:40:22] lips and your own life. Mrs. Jesus
[1:40:25] Christ,
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; fulfill this time in you
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; the hope of glory.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And I'm not taking brother
[1:40:34] Brandham out of it. Trust me.
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; But I am bringing myself under the word
[1:40:41] that he preached.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; And because I believe it, I'm lifting
[1:40:45] him up as the prophet because he had his
[1:40:49] job to do. Now it's my turn.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; I've got to take the same word and
[1:40:52] produce
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; signs and wonders,
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; life behind me.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; We get so caught up in him. Sure,
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; but you're in Malachi 4:2. Let's get
[1:41:06] caught up into that. TURN OUR HEARTS TO
[1:41:08] GOD THROUGH THE WORD OF GOD, THROUGH THE
[1:41:10] PROPHET OF GOD. TURN YOUR HEARTS TO THAT
[1:41:12] PATTERN AND WATCH JESUS COME INTO YOU
[1:41:14] AND FULFILL EVERY NEED that you ever
[1:41:16] needed.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; All right?
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; And every desire that's in your heart.
[1:41:21] Watch your children grow into statue of
[1:41:24] a perfect man. Your ch girls
[1:41:27] a lady of the gospel.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; Yes. Praise the Lord.
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; For we know that in him dwelle the
[1:41:38] fullness of the godhead bodily. The
[1:41:40] entire Godhead was in him.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; He was both father, son, and the holy
[1:41:47] ghost and dwelt in a human form. the
[1:41:51] theophony of God, the great image of God
[1:41:56] that he made man in then placed him in
[1:42:00] the earth. He had a body. God isn't
[1:42:05] without a body. God got a body and it
[1:42:09] looked like a man. Moses saw it. Others
[1:42:14] saw it AND IT LOOKS LIKE A MAN. AND IT'S
[1:42:17] JUST an impression that is of what that
[1:42:22] is and everything on earth and the
[1:42:25] beauty and the sweetness and the beauty
[1:42:27] of the earth is nothing else in the
[1:42:30] world but a
[1:42:32] answer to a fear far better not fear but
[1:42:37] be far better than that that wasn't us
[1:42:42] when we
[1:42:44] leave the world forever. Everything in
[1:42:48] earth is just a pattern of that which is
[1:42:52] in heaven.
[1:42:54] Everything that's good. Everything
[1:42:58] that's righteous, everything that's
[1:43:00] beautiful, trees, birds, everything is
[1:43:04] just a pattern of what's in heaven. Our
[1:43:08] own life, and this is my thought, our
[1:43:11] own life is just a pattern. It's just a
[1:43:15] shadow,
[1:43:17] not the real thing. It's the negative
[1:43:20] side. It takes the death to develop the
[1:43:24] picture to put us back in the theophony
[1:43:31] where come from where we come from. Then
[1:43:34] in that resurrection,
[1:43:36] we come in his likeness
[1:43:40] and his resurrection body. What a
[1:43:42] beautiful not only beautiful but it is
[1:43:46] the real solemn truth of God's eternal
[1:43:50] word that we be like him.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; As the musicians come. I got too much
[1:43:58] here. As the musicians come. Hallelujah.
[1:44:02] You love him.
[1:44:10] Is there anything I said tonight that
[1:44:12] you don't believe?
[1:44:16] Rapture is going to happen.
[1:44:19] Why? Cuz God is bringing his people in a
[1:44:23] pattern. Bringing everybody's mind into
[1:44:25] the word of God and he's getting it
[1:44:27] ready. Every church in America, every
[1:44:32] church in every other country has to
[1:44:34] come to one message and that's Jesus
[1:44:37] Christ.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Oh church, he's here.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; If you have a need this morning or this
[1:44:47] afternoon, don't wait until next week.
[1:44:51] Let me and Brother Windle lay hands on
[1:44:53] you and pray with you. Sometimes you
[1:44:55] just need Jesus in in in flesh form.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; Maybe that little touch will get you
[1:45:02] across what you're going through. Don't
[1:45:04] be afraid to come up to get prayed for.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Anybody laughs at you, shame on them.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; That just shows that they need an
[1:45:11] experience with God.
[1:45:13] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; But I would rather make sure I'm ready
[1:45:19] cuz he's coming soon.
[1:45:22] The morning's breaking very soon.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; If it's by the grace of God, we'll all
[1:45:28] go in a rapture. But it might be God's
[1:45:30] will for one of us to die tomorrow.
[1:45:34] And where that tree lays, that's where
[1:45:35] it's going to lay.
[1:45:39] Let's tenderize our heart every time we
[1:45:42] come to church, every time we read the
[1:45:45] Bible, every time we pray, every time we
[1:45:46] listen to a message. Oh, just let that
[1:45:49] word
[1:45:51] soften our hearts.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Don't let this world and the things of
[1:45:56] this world pull you guys apart as a
[1:45:59] family.
[1:46:02] This is beautiful.
[1:46:04] Keep it that way.
[1:46:06] Let our pride just get completely out of
[1:46:08] our lives and just love one another.
[1:46:12] Don't say something that's going to hurt
[1:46:13] one another, but just stay in the
[1:46:15] pattern of God and and just soak in the
[1:46:19] presence of the Lord in your life
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; and watch him come
[1:46:24] and mold you and shape you.
[1:46:30] Stay in that pattern, church.
[1:46:33] I love you guys.
[1:46:35] What are we going to sing?
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[1:46:44] to be like Jesus.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; All I am
[1:47:00] is to be
[1:47:02] like.
[1:47:04] Oh yes Lord.
[1:47:08] Is
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; there another
[1:47:15] from birth
[1:47:18] to glory
[1:47:18] &gt;&gt; glory.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. All I ask
[1:47:30] is to be
[1:47:33] like him.
[1:47:38] To be like Jesus.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; To be like like Jesus.
[1:47:52] All I ask,
[1:47:54] oh, all I am
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; is to be
[1:48:03] like him.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; All through life's journey
[1:48:16] from birth to glory. Glory.
[1:48:25] All I have
[1:48:31] is to be
[1:48:33] like you.
[1:48:41] Let your word
[1:48:43] be born
[1:48:45] in the manger of my heart.
[1:48:51] Let it live for me.
[1:48:54] Let it start.
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Live inside this house
[1:49:03] and mold it every day.
[1:49:08] Let your word be born
[1:49:12] in the manger
[1:49:15] of
[1:49:16] my heart. Verse one.
[1:49:20] It was a tiny simple stay
[1:49:25] all beaten.
[1:49:29] Oh, hardly
[1:49:31] the place
[1:49:33] for a king to be born.
[1:49:37] He didn't choose some place special
[1:49:42] to reveal his majesty.
[1:49:46] So I know if I can feel control,
[1:49:51] you'll be born in me.
[1:49:55] Let your word
[1:49:59] be born
[1:50:01] in the major of my heart.
[1:50:06] Let it live in me.
[1:50:09] Let it start.
[1:50:13] him inside this house and play
[1:50:18] and hold it every day.
[1:50:22] Let your word be born
[1:50:26] in the manger
[1:50:28] of
[1:50:30] my heart. Hourly of nothing.
[1:50:34] Oh, I
[1:50:36] am nothing. So true. Not much to behold.
[1:50:42] So unlikely
[1:50:44] the place
[1:50:46] for your word to unfold.
[1:50:50] But if I shield his vessel
[1:50:55] and let him have his way,
[1:50:59] then from glory unto glory
[1:51:03] and change me day by day.
[1:51:08] Let over
[1:51:13] in the manger of my heart.
[1:51:18] Let it live for me.

[1:51:34] Let your word be born
[1:51:37] in the manger
[1:51:40] of my heart. Let your word Let your word
[1:51:47] be born
[1:51:49] in the manger of my heart. Grant it
[1:51:53] Lord. Let it live in me.
[1:51:58] better storm.
[1:52:02] Live inside the house of plain
[1:52:06] and loed every day.
[1:52:10] Let your word be born
[1:52:14] in the manger
[1:52:16] of my heart. Outwardly I'm nothing.
[1:52:22] Outwardly I'm nothing.
[1:52:26] Not much to behold,
[1:52:30] so unlikely
[1:52:32] the place
[1:52:34] for your word to unfold.
[1:52:38] But it found the shield vessel
[1:52:42] and let him have his way. Oh my, then
[1:52:46] from glory unto glory.
[1:52:50] You change me day by day.
[1:52:54] Let your word
[1:52:58] be born
[1:53:00] in the manger of my heart.
[1:53:04] Let him live for me.
[1:53:08] Let him start.
[1:53:12] Live inside this house of clay
[1:53:16] and mold me every day.
[1:53:21] that you were working before
[1:53:24] in the manger.
[1:53:29] My heart.
[1:53:34] I want to live
[1:53:38] the way
[1:53:41] he wants me
[1:53:44] to.
[1:53:46] I want to give
[1:53:50] until there's just no more
[1:53:56] to give.
[1:53:58] And we love
[1:54:03] him. There's just no
[1:54:07] more love.
[1:54:09] I could never
[1:54:12] never round out
[1:54:16] the Lord.
[1:54:20] Oh, I want to live
[1:54:24] the way
[1:54:27] he wants me
[1:54:30] to live.
[1:54:32] I want to give
[1:54:36] until there's just no more to give.
[1:54:44] Heavy love
[1:54:47] loves me.
[1:54:50] There's just no more.
[1:54:54] Oh, I could never
[1:54:58] ever
[1:54:59] love
[1:55:01] the Lord.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; Now I'm giving my life
[1:55:12] away.
[1:55:16] I'm laying it down at the altar.
[1:55:23] Now I'm giving my life
[1:55:28] away.
[1:55:33] The very least I can offer
[1:55:39] is my all.
[1:55:44] Here I stand today.
[1:55:49] Giving my life
[1:55:52] away
[1:55:55] now. I'm giving my life
[1:56:00] away.
[1:56:04] I'm laying it down at the altar.
[1:56:11] Now I'm giving my life
[1:56:16] away.
[1:56:20] The very least I can offer
[1:56:26] is my own.
[1:56:31] Here I stand today.
[1:56:36] Give me my life
[1:56:39] away. Sing about that again now. Now I'm
[1:56:44] keeping my life
[1:56:47] away.
[1:56:51] I'm laying it down at the offer.
[1:56:57] Now I'm giving my life
[1:57:02] away.
[1:57:07] The very least I can offer
[1:57:13] is my all.
[1:57:17] Here I stand today
[1:57:22] giving my life
[1:57:25] away.
[1:57:31] Without him,
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; I can
[1:57:37] do nothing.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Without him,
[1:57:46] I surely
[1:57:49] fail.
[1:57:55] Without him,
[1:57:58] I would
[1:58:01] be drifting.
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, like a shield.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; Without
[1:58:15] him, I could do nothing. Oh, without
[1:58:19] him. Oh my, I can
[1:58:24] do nothing
[1:58:29] without you.
[1:58:33] I surely
[1:58:35] fail.
[1:58:41] Without you,
[1:58:44] I would be drifting.
[1:58:51] Oh, like a shield
[1:58:55] without
[1:58:57] herself.
[1:59:02] Oh Jesus,
[1:59:08] my Jesus.
[1:59:14] Do you know him today?
[1:59:20] Please don't hurt him.
[1:59:24] Oh
[1:59:26] Jesus,
[1:59:31] my Jesus.
[1:59:36] Without him,
[1:59:39] how lost
[1:59:41] I would be. Here we do the verse.
[1:59:47] Oh, without him, oh my. Oh, I would be
[1:59:53] dying.
[1:59:58] Without him,
[2:00:01] I be enslaved.
[2:00:09] Without him,
[2:00:13] life would be hopeless.
[2:00:18] Oh my. But with Jesus,
[2:00:23] thank God
[2:00:26] I'm saved.
[2:00:28] Thank you, Lord. Oh, Jesus.
[2:00:36] My Jesus,
[2:00:42] do you know he
[2:00:45] today?
[2:00:47] Please don't turn him
[2:00:50] away. Oh
[2:00:53] Jesus,
[2:00:58] my Jesus.
[2:01:04] Without him,
[2:01:07] how
[2:01:09] I would be.
[2:01:14] Oh Jesus,
[2:01:20] my Jesus.
[2:01:25] Do you know him?
[2:01:31] Please don't hurt
[2:01:34] away. Oh
[2:01:37] Jesus,
[2:01:41] my Jesus.
[2:01:47] Without him,
[2:01:50] how lost
[2:01:52] I would be.
[2:01:58] He is my everything.
[2:02:06] He is
[2:02:09] my all.
[2:02:12] God.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Yes Lord. He is
[2:02:17] my
[2:02:18] everything.
[2:02:22] both great and small.
[2:02:30] He gave his life
[2:02:34] for me,
[2:02:38] made everything
[2:02:40] new.
[2:02:45] He is my
[2:02:50] everything.
[2:02:53] none other will do.
[2:03:00] He is my
[2:03:05] everything.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; He is my all.
[2:03:16] He is my everything.
[2:03:24] Both great
[2:03:26] and small.
[2:03:31] He gave his life
[2:03:35] for me.

[2:04:46] He is my everything.
[2:04:52] Hallelujah.
[2:04:54] None other will do. Oh, let's sing it
[2:04:59] again.
[2:05:01] He is my everything.
[2:05:08] He is my all.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; He's so wonderful.
[2:05:16] He is.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; You are my everything.
[2:05:20] Everything.
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, let me stay the pattern.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, the greatest.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:05:28] Hallelujah.
[2:05:31] You gave your life
[2:05:35] for me,
[2:05:38] made everything
[2:05:41] new.
[2:05:46] He is my everything
[2:05:53] none other will do.
[2:06:01] Praise the Lord.
[2:06:04] There's a joy that comes when you stay
[2:06:07] to the pattern.
[2:06:13] The lines are blurred in so many ways
[2:06:15] today. There's no there's not a
[2:06:19] clearcut.
[2:06:27] When you start questioning the pattern,
[2:06:32] you're you're bound to get disillusioned
[2:06:35] somewhere.
[2:06:37] And if you keep the pattern and the
[2:06:39] boundaries straight and clear,
[2:06:42] then
[2:06:45] not get us see how far how close you can
[2:06:48] get
[2:06:50] to the boundary, but just as brother
[2:06:52] Brandon would tell us,
[2:06:54] stay way on the inside. Y'all remember
[2:06:56] what brother Brandham talked about the I
[2:06:59] I can't remember the full story now
[2:07:01] about the
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. the the the carriage rider that
[2:07:06] was he was needing to get across the
[2:07:08] mountain pass. And he and one man said,
[2:07:11] "Listen,
[2:07:13] I can get you there. I can get all the
[2:07:14] way close to that edge." And I said, "I
[2:07:18] I can gu you around that."
[2:07:22] And the other said, "Man, I've come
[2:07:24] close this way." And another man stood
[2:07:26] up and said, "I I you know, I
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; I just try to stay as close to the
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; to the mountain and hug that mountain as
[2:07:35] good as I can hug it."
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to be my I want you
[2:07:40] to be my driver."
[2:07:43] &gt;&gt; I I just want to just say as close as I
[2:07:46] can. And you say, "But brother Wendle,
[2:07:48] that
[2:07:50] I don't know. I don't see any." Listen,
[2:07:54] God's given us a pattern.
[2:07:57] Let's stay as close as we can to that
[2:07:59] pattern as we can get. And don't let the
[2:08:01] world in. Don't let anything Well, but
[2:08:05] but it but let's just keep all the butts
[2:08:08] and the questions and the ifs and the
[2:08:10] whats and the Let's just Let's just keep
[2:08:12] it as close to the Bible as as we know
[2:08:14] to keep it.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:18] Because there's one thing for certain.
[2:08:20] We are on the final leg. We're on the
[2:08:22] final leg. Let's
[2:08:26] Let's just make sure that the next
[2:08:27] generation knows
[2:08:30] what we are and who we are. What men are
[2:08:34] and what women are and what
[2:08:39] cats are and dogs are. And let's just
[2:08:42] let's just keep let's just keep the
[2:08:44] pattern.
[2:08:52] I'm thankful for this pattern. It's
[2:08:54] worked for It's worked for all these
[2:08:57] years.
[2:08:59] And I'm still glad. I I I tell you, I
[2:09:02] I'm I'm glad I'm glad that the word is
[2:09:05] still it's very clear-cut for us all
[2:09:08] here today.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; It'll keep you in his presence. I'm not
[2:09:15] talking about legalism now.
[2:09:18] Because if we get in the well, I've read
[2:09:20] the Bible so many chapters today and
[2:09:23] I've done this. Well, that that's okay.
[2:09:27] But we're talking about
[2:09:29] I want to I I want to hear from the
[2:09:32] Lord. I want to I want to read what he's
[2:09:34] got for me. I You understand what I'm
[2:09:36] saying? It's a love. It's it's Lord,
[2:09:39] keep me in that space
[2:09:42] where it's me and you. Keep me according
[2:09:45] to your pattern. Keep me in that secret
[2:09:49] place that the world knows nothing
[2:09:51] about. That's what I want to be. Well,
[2:09:55] praise the Lord. Did you enjoy that
[2:09:56] message here tonight?
[2:10:01] Amen.
[2:10:03] Amen.
[2:10:05] You know, and as we was talking about
[2:10:06] the place that was only that was
[2:10:08] reserved for just the high priest
[2:10:11] and then as Christ was hanging on
[2:10:14] Calvary, the veil was renting too. Now
[2:10:18] he's inviting every one of us into that
[2:10:20] secret place, not a building.
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I heard a preacher recently
[2:10:25] saying, "Oh,
[2:10:27] this church is the place that I've
[2:10:29] placed my name. This church." So when
[2:10:33] you come to hear and pray, this is the
[2:10:36] place he's put his name. When you go
[2:10:38] into our one of the prayer rooms in this
[2:10:41] church, remember this is the place that
[2:10:43] he's placed his name.
[2:10:46] And I thought, "Oh my,
[2:10:51] he's placed his name in his word."
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; And when you're in his word, when you're
[2:10:57] there, there's where his blessings are.
[2:11:01] Just stay with that. Well, praise the
[2:11:03] Lord. Aren't you glad for that?
[2:11:08] Amen.
[2:11:10] Hallelujah.
[2:11:12] By one spirit are we baptized
[2:11:15] into one covenant,
[2:11:18] one body, one Jesus Christ.
[2:11:22] Well, praise the Lord. I'm glad for that
[2:11:25] pattern. Let me let me do that. I I that
[2:11:28] that last quote brother William read I I
[2:11:30] had to look it up while he was reading
[2:11:32] it and that was that's pretty powerful.
[2:11:34] Amen. That what we're doing. Amen. This
[2:11:37] here is just a pattern. This here's just
[2:11:40] a pattern right here. Our little worship
[2:11:43] our that we come. It's a pattern of that
[2:11:46] great day when we're coming over there
[2:11:48] and it's going to be what a what? So you
[2:11:52] are actually patterning. Amen. God's
[2:11:55] using you to pattern that that
[2:11:58] relationship that the bride will have
[2:12:00] with him in eternity. Well, isn't that
[2:12:02] wonderful?
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; You're patterning him, but he's also
[2:12:06] patterning. Well, glory to God. In that
[2:12:09] day, I will worship with them and in
[2:12:12] them. Praise the Lord. What a wonderful,
[2:12:15] wonderful pattern.
[2:12:18] Glory to God.
[2:12:20] both great
[2:12:23] and small.
[2:12:28] You gave your life for me,
[2:12:35] made everything
[2:12:38] new.
[2:12:43] You are my everything.
[2:12:50] none other.
[2:12:57] We want to give you an opportunity to to
[2:13:01] give an offering.
[2:13:04] And um
[2:13:06] brother William is pastoring a very
[2:13:08] small church
[2:13:11] in a
[2:13:14] very expensive town.
[2:13:18] That mountain country up there is
[2:13:23] very expensive. and and um
[2:13:27] and so uh
[2:13:34] and work, you know, it just work is not
[2:13:37] just something that you can go and and
[2:13:39] find just real easy. And so, uh, I I
[2:13:43] want I want us here tonight if if you've
[2:13:46] got an offering to give, I know it'll
[2:13:49] it'll definitely be a blessing to
[2:13:53] um to help them with their trip, but
[2:13:56] also maybe help put on some an expense
[2:13:59] or something back home. And um uh
[2:14:05] to me it was a
[2:14:07] uh brother William and Sister Sharon
[2:14:11] answering the the the conviction of
[2:14:14] their heart to go up there. It was like
[2:14:18] I mean that was a great sacrifice uh to
[2:14:22] to go there. I'm talking about I mean
[2:14:24] the cheapest rent $2,500 a month or
[2:14:27] somewhere like that. and and um I mean
[2:14:30] it's it's crazy expensive up there
[2:14:35] and uh but they they fell in love with
[2:14:38] the people and had a burden for the
[2:14:40] people and so if you have we just want
[2:14:44] to give you that opportunity. Uh,
[2:14:46] Brother William sure didn't ask me to
[2:14:48] say that, but um uh just checking on him
[2:14:52] occasionally and and um I know I know it
[2:14:56] would be a great blessing.
[2:15:00] Praise the Lord.
[2:15:03] You are
[2:15:06] my all.
[2:15:11] You are my everything,
[2:15:18] both great
[2:15:21] and small.
[2:15:25] You gave your life
[2:15:30] for me.
[2:15:32] You made everything
[2:15:36] new.
[2:15:40] You are my
[2:15:44] everything.
[2:15:48] None other will do.
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:15:56] I just want to please the Lord.
[2:15:59] I just want to please
[2:16:02] the Lord
[2:16:07] in his will in every way
[2:16:12] to be lost
[2:16:16] in his presence.
[2:16:19] Found in his likeness
[2:16:22] to hear him say, "Well done."
[2:16:26] someday.
[2:16:29] Yes. I just want to please the Lord,
[2:16:39] be in his will in every way.
[2:16:44] To be lost
[2:16:48] in his presence,

[2:21:28] and um uh dad's not feeling well. Sister
[2:21:31] Tracy's not feeling well and so u just
[2:21:37] several that's that's that's a little
[2:21:39] under the under the weather. And um so
[2:21:44] we're just uh we're just believing the
[2:21:46] Lord for all of them. And um so they
[2:21:50] they're running some more tests on on an
[2:21:52] Angie uh this this week. And so uh we
[2:21:57] want to continue to pray for her and
[2:22:01] that they find out what's going on with
[2:22:04] with her.
[2:22:08] Sister Carol. Yes. Uh uh uh so and
[2:22:13] Angie's we you know we it may be her
[2:22:16] gallbladder but I mean uh she's been
[2:22:19] she's been sick deathly sick and so uh
[2:22:24] we just we want to uh to continue to
[2:22:27] pray and just believe that whatever's
[2:22:30] whatever is keeping her the way she is
[2:22:33] that the Lord would would help her. And
[2:22:37] uh uh it's just been
[2:22:41] man I have to tell you the the doctors
[2:22:44] and the appointments uh
[2:22:47] her scheduling and all that they those
[2:22:49] guys are slower than the seven year edge
[2:22:52] and that I mean these she's been
[2:22:54] suffering and and
[2:22:57] I don't think even none of mom and dad's
[2:23:00] uh stuff I don't think they've had to
[2:23:03] wait near as long on things that they've
[2:23:05] had to go through or any of us really.

[2:24:42] and go to the Lord in prayer for all of
[2:24:43] these needs that we have mentioned.
[2:24:46] Father, we we take all of these needs,
[2:24:49] Lord. I'm not going to remention them.
[2:24:52] Lord, I I believe that you heard these
[2:24:56] names and the needs that have been
[2:24:59] mentioned.
[2:25:00] And Father, you said that you would even
[2:25:03] answer before we ask.
[2:25:06] And Father, I'm asking that your Holy
[2:25:09] Spirit, we don't know how you how you
[2:25:11] can move on different needs and
[2:25:13] different parts of the country all at
[2:25:15] the same time, but you're God. And Lord,
[2:25:19] we're asking that you would just reach
[2:25:22] down your hand, Lord, in Stillwater,
[2:25:27] here in Pawne, there in Missouri.
[2:25:30] Your presence, Lord, would be so
[2:25:34] rich, Lord, that you would minister,
[2:25:36] Lord, to all of those needs there in
[2:25:38] Henrietta.
[2:25:40] Father,

[2:25:45] We're just mortal beings. Lord, that
[2:25:48] fighting so many things in our bodies,
[2:25:51] Father, I pray that the great physician
[2:25:55] would reach down every one of these
[2:25:58] individuals and you would touch them.
[2:26:00] Lord, Sister Angie, Lord, Aunt Angie,
[2:26:04] Lord, all of those who are in need right
[2:26:08] now. Father, we we come and and
[2:26:11] intercede on the behalf of all of our
[2:26:16] fellow bride members. Lord, be with
[2:26:20] them. Oh, great God,
[2:26:24] great high priest of our confession. I
[2:26:27] ask Lord that you would bring healing to
[2:26:30] each of these individuals, Lord.
[2:26:33] Oh, we need you, Father. We thank you
[2:26:37] for it.
[2:26:38] Now Lord, I pray that you would help us
[2:26:41] as we dismiss here tonight.
[2:26:43] Let us stay in your pattern and
[2:26:45] according to your pattern.
[2:26:48] Help us Lord to always see the spirit
[2:26:51] behind everything, Lord. And let us
[2:26:54] discern
[2:26:56] according to the message of the hour.
[2:26:59] Father, we thank you for it. Be with
[2:27:01] Brother William and Sister Sharon as
[2:27:03] they're getting up early to head home.
[2:27:07] Lord, as brother William has to go back
[2:27:09] to work on Tuesday,
[2:27:11] I pray, Lord, that your angel would give
[2:27:15] them good rest tonight, Lord, and a safe
[2:27:18] travel tomorrow. Bless the church. Bless
[2:27:21] all the saints there, Lord, in Pinetop.

[2:27:31] people and lead them close to you.
