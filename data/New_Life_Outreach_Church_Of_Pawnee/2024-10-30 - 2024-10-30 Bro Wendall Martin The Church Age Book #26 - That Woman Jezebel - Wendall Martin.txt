remember them in our prayers here tonight if we may and I was listening to a message today in in desperations and it really struck out to me if you don't mind me reading this quote here says now I believe we're living in the days that otherwise the days that we we're living in should cause the church to go into complete desperation says I believe since the message this morning from God not me said I believe it ought to throw this entire congregation into desperation that we have played long enough amen we've went to church long enough we've got to do something he says I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love the love of God I think that the love of God causes desperation he also continues and says until the whole church gets to a place that it's between death and life that you've got to have an hour or perish then God will move on the scene he says it takes desperation to bring God on the scene how many can say Lord Make Me desperate here tonight we need a Revival in this church again and I believe desperation will cause God to come upon the scene I believe that and if you have a need upon your heart just make it known by the lifting of your hand God bless you now brother let's bow our heads and dear heavenly father how we love you Lord we just want to thank you for everything that you've done for us Lord just giving us

there and uh Minister a little bit on family and and so it was it was a wonderful weekend there as well and they wanted us to uh send our our our greetings to to all of you and um they all love you all very much let's look here in Revelations uh 2 and 20 notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calls herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto Idols amen let's go to the Lord here in prayer father we want to thank you today for your blessings that we know that you have given us Lord just the very heartbeat Lord our our health that we have have and most importantly Lord the the desire to serve you and to please you Lord these are all blessings that come from your hand and we want to say thank you for that lord it's such a privilege to be called your wife your bride and Lord Jesus we love your word and we love your spirit we love your convictions Lord and we're just asking father that you would just speak to our hearts tonight as we read here uh along the church age book and I just pray Lord that you would bless uh everyone that is that is present everyone that's online Lord we just ask that you would you would teach us as we set at your feet and we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name am amen God bless you you can be seated here tonight and um so we're going to start here at um at page uh 226 and um uh this is this is dealing with um that woman Jezebel and um so we're going to um we're we're going to start right there where it says that woman Jezebel uh on the bottom of the page and um so we understand that the holy spirit is is showing us that there would be two Spirits in in in the world there was going to be Christ the spirit of Christ the anointed one and there was going to be the spirit of the Antichrist both of them are christs both of them are anointed ones one is righteous and holy the other is evil amen and and against God against the Christ so Christ amen one is the real one is the counterfeit Christ is going to have a bride amen and and Satan is going to have a bride now but the thing is is the disguises is this amen Satan is coming in and setting as as the book of uh Isaiah the 14th chapter that he wanted to sit upon the congregation of the north and he wanted to be worshiped as God and he wanted to have these things and so they're both called churches so there's going to be uh the church nominal and there's going to be the church spiritual and the rest of the world is not going to understand what is going on Amen they're they're going most of the people in the world they look at churches amen they they they cry they all have a Bible they all uh amen they all talk about Jesus they all do these things but yet according to the scriptures amen Satan has come in in a disguise and he is luring these people to himself and and is getting his own bride amen so so the Bride of Jesus the only way that you're ever going to tell the Bride of Jesus from the Bride of Satan is the Bride of Jesus will always come back to this they will always line everything every belief every attitude every our thought process our our everything about us our belief system will be based upon this right here and if you don't base it here then you can be deceived amen because the Antichrist Spirit the Bible says the whole world is going to follow after that Antichrist spirit and so they're they're going to they're going to follow after him there's going to be a lot of emotions there's going to be a lot of things but I want to say today amen we want to always come back to Vindicated thus saith the Lord everything in our lives amen now it's easy for us to say we believe in Jesus name baptism so so so we're the Bride of Jesus Christ well that that that's good that's good we believe in a prophet so we've uh so so we're the Bride of Jesus Christ you're you're H the bride of Christ when you have received his holy spirit within you amen then you become the dwelling place of the Lord Jesus J can you say amen and his spirit will always lead to his word so let's start here um in in uh 226 all the way down that woman Jezebel he says the Apostle James also like to say it's it's good to have these the these uh these two brothers again that's been from out of town always been it's just been Delight to have you guys here with us uh on these Wednesday nights and you know we know it takes you know there's a lot of things well there's not a whole lot of things you can do in ponie but but you know there's a lot of things y'all could be doing and y'all being with us on these Wednesday nights has just really been nice amen so God bless y'all amen it says um the Apostle James shows us the course that sin takes now does somebody else does some um uh do do you guys have church age books y'all okay all right let me while you're let me just walk in here because I've got another one in here hallelujah if you want then you can take it home with [Music] you so um um we've got so we're on page 226 there and um all right um Apostle James showed us the course that sin takes James 1:14-15 but every man is tempted when he has drawn away of his own lust and enticed when lust has conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished brings forth death now that is a picture of exactly what is happening in the church ages as Sin started nothing but a feeling so the death to the church started with the simple little notice Deeds of the nians from the Deeds it went to a Doctrine from the doctrine it embraced the power of the state and the introduction of paganism now in this age it goes It goes to its own propheus teacher so it travels on until we find until it will find itself in the Lake of Fire and that is exactly where it is going to end up the second death now the whole Cry Of God against this fourth age is found in his denunciation of this propheus Jezebel and to understand exactly why he denounces her so we will have to look her up look her history in the Bible and we find that what she did back there then we will know what is going on at this time the first and very important thing that we learn about Jezebel is that she is not a daughter of Abraham nor is her induction into the tribes of Israel as one of spiritual admission as was that of Ruth moabitas no sir that this woman was the daughter of athel the king of sidon First Kings 1631 who was the priest of aardi he had gained the throne on by murdering his predecessor felis and so we see right away that she was the daughter of a murderer and that certainly reminds us of Cain and the way she become part of Israel was not through the spiritual channels that God had ordained for Gentile admission but she came in by marriage to Ahab the king of the 10 the 10 can the 10 tribes of Israel now this Union as we have seen was was not spiritual it was political so this woman who was steeped in idolatry did not have the least desire to become a worshipper of the one true God but rather she came with a vowed intentions of turning Israel away from the Lord now Israel the 10 tribes had already known what it was to worship the golden calvs but as yet they were not sold out to idolatry for God was worshiped and the law of Moses was acknowledged but from the time of ahab's marriage to Jezebel idolatry progressed in a deadly fashion it was when this woman become a priestess in the temp uh in the temples that she erected to aard Venus and Baal son God that Israel uh came to the crisis point of her life with this in mind we can see uh we can begin to see that the spirit of God is setting forth in the th tyan age here it is Ahab married Jezebel he did it in a political maneuver to strengthen his kingdom and secure it it is exactly what the church did when it married under Constantine they both got together for political reasons and though uh though they put a spiritual air to it now no one can convince me that that Constantine was a Christian he was a pagan with what looked like Christian tappings trappings he painted white crosses on the soldier Shields he was the originator of the Knights of Columbus he put a cross on the steeple of St Sophia's thereby starting a tradition it was Constantine's idea to get everyone together the pagans the nominal Christians and the true Christians and for a while it looked as if he was succeed for the true for the real Believers came along to see if they could bring back the ones that had drifted away from the word when they saw that they couldn't bring them back into the truth they were forced to break away with the body political then when they did they were called Heretics and persecuted let me say right here that we have the very same thing going on right now people are all coming together they're writing a a Bible that will suit everyone whether it be a Jew Catholic or Protestant they have their own nin Council but they call it the ecumenical council and do you know uh and do you know whom all these organizations fight they fight the true Pentecostals I don't mean the organization called Pentecostal I mean the ones that are Pentecost because they are filled with the Holy Ghost and have the signs and Gifts in their midst because they walk in truth when Ahab married Jezebel for political reasons he sold his Birthright and you join up with an organization and you sell your Birthright brother whether you want to believe it or not every Protestant group that ever came out and then went back sold their Birthright and when you sell your Birthright you're just like Esau you can cry and repent all you want but it won't do you any good there's only one thing you can do and that is come out of her my people and stop partaking of her sins now if you don't think I'm right just answer this one question can any man living tell me what church or what move of God ever had a Revival and came back after it went into organization and become a denomination read your histories you can't find one not even one it was the Midnight Hour for Israel when she joined with the world and the spiritual for the political it was the Midnight Hour at NAA when the church did the same thing it is the Midnight Hour right now that the churches are coming together now when Ahab married Jezebel he allowed her to take the state money and erect two huge houses of worship of aardi and Bale the one was erected for baale was big enough for all Israel to come and worship there at and and when Constantine and the church married he gave the church buildings set up altars and images organized the hierarchy that had already been shaping up and when Jezebel got the power of the state behind her she forced her religion on the people and killed the prophets and the priests of God it got so bad that Elijah the messenger to his day thought that he was the only one left but God had 7,000 more that had bound the need to bail and right now out there amongst all of the denominations of Baptist methodists Presbyterians Etc there are some who will come out and come back to God I want you to know that I'm not I am not now and never have been against the people it's the denomination the system of organization that I am against I have to be against it for God hates it now just to just let me stop here a minute here and rehearse that we uh what we have brought out about the worship in thyra I said that there uh that they worshiped Apollo who was the son God along with the emperor now this Apollo was called the averter of evil he turned evil away from people he blessed them and was a real God to them he was supposed to teach the people he explained about worship and Temple rights and services to God about sacrifices and death and life after death and the way he did that was through a prophetess who sat entranced upon a tripod chair my do you see it here is that propheus called Jezebel she is teaching the people her teaching is seducing the Servants of God and causing them to commit fornication now fornication means idol worship that is that is what its spiritual meaning is it is an illegal Union ahab's Union Constantine's Union were both illegal both committed spiritual fornication and every fornicator will wind up in the Lake of Fire God said so so are you understanding here we're we're where we're coming now we if you if you go back and and again these are seven churches these are seven uh uh these seven churches in Revelations 2 they uh they they represent seven periods over the over the course of the church these last 2,000 years have had seven distinct periods of time and God is predicting and and talking about how that how it would it would end up or it would start out leaving their first love and and and and and and you know and you there are some there that have some of the Deeds of the nicians and then then the next the next uh uh the the the second phase of the church that it's going in deeper and how that now it's becoming the second third age is becoming a teaching and and we understand that nicians means to conquer the Ley so there was a spirit of antichrist amen now remember the the the the the Apostle John says even now are many antichrists Among Us that was back when Jesus was alive where after Jesus had left and John is telling the church contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints because there is a spirit that is trying to to lure you and to bring you back uh away from Christ and so so John and and the Apostle Paul even said he says I fear that when I leave after my departure there's going to be Grievous wolves that come in these are going there's going to be spirits that are going to anoint men and they're going to try to take you away from what uh uh from from the simple love and faith uh in in God and so so we can we can see this that each one of these ages now we are here in this in this fourth age and now Satan has come in for the he's come in for the uh he's going after he's he's he's going in for the choke cold and and so amen now he has got the church it has now been hundreds of years since the day of Pentecost he has now got amen uh uh he he has been able to to to prepare and prepare and prepare and prepare until there was a woman on earth who was willing to be seduced she was she was willingly seduced by by this Spirit of the Antichrist and then she taught others how to seduce so she become a teacher of that how many understands that so so amen so fornication what what is fornication fornication is is a amen an act of adultery uh uh uh from a from a married person and so do you to to have uh to be a fornicator or or from a well from a from a non-married person I'm sorry amen fornication so so she was espoused under Christ she had promised she was going to be Christ amen but she began to uh uh you know uh you know go off and and and and and and commit fornication with with somebody else so so in this spiritual sense amen the church now what is what is spiritual fornication it's idolatry so so it is to accept somebody you say that you love God and the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh so when we say we're worshiping Jesus amen we are saying that it is this Bible in the body of Jesus Christ Jesus was the word made flesh and for us to say Amen well um I I you know I I believe the the way the the the way uh brother so and so believes it and if it's not found in the Bible then you are in the act of idolatry you're taking someone else's word over the word of the one that bought you amen and redeemed you can you say Amen now am I am I making sense to y'all amen so spiritual fornication amen it's it's not it's not like there is a a a sexual act per se it is idolatry it is choosing someone else and putting your Allegiance your love your confidence in something other than the god of Glory who came down to to to purchase you and redeem you to himself amen amen now the Catholic church now when this is all set up here we're understanding that when Constantine came in and he put He put the politics and the church together and they married then we understand that this age here went 900 and something years and it would be it would become the the the Catholic Church would rule the world through the Kings all of the kings of the earth amen were now going to be Catholic and they were going to enforce the Catholic Doctrine upon anybody if you did not if you did not uh uh bow to idol worship and and worship Peter's Idol or or or Paul's Idol or or Mary's Idol amen then you were killed if you baptized in the name of Jesus Christ like like the Bible says there there in Acts 2:38 repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost if you were to do that in that day they would kill you burn you to the steak you see they they they had got to the point to where they took the word set it aside gave it their own interpretation and made the world to believe it okay amen so so y'all understanding amen now uh how how many How many's uh y y'all with me on that amen now so so here it is amen they they uh uh uh and that and that's sort of I I I sort of said that for the benefit of our of our brothers over here that's not been with us for the last 26 weeks as as we've gone through the Book of Revelations and and that is we we we we want to we want to be the one that is going to believe everything God says you're not to believe me you're not to believe your daddy you're not to believe your mama you're not to believe anybody else but the word of God and any man that'll put his opinion above the word of God then he is he he becomes amen uh a a teacher of fornication spiritual fornication amen so let now let's go ahead and and uh let let's read uh continue to read it says now then the teaching of the Catholic church the church is female it is a woman and denies the word of God the pope who is literally a polo in the in the modern version has taught the people to join themselves to Idols the Roman Catholic or the Roman Church has now become a false propheus to the people because she has taken away the word of God from the people and given her own ideas to what constitutes forgiveness of sins what brings the blessings of God and the priests have gone so far as to State categorically that they have power not only in life but in death they teach on their own that there is a Purgatory but you can't find that in the word they teach that prayers and masses and money will get you out of P purgatory and into heaven the whole system is based upon its teaching uh that that the whole system that is based upon its teaching is false it does not lie on the sure foundation of the revelation of God in his word but lies on the shifting sinking Sands of its own diabolical untruths the church went right uh from organization to denomination and hence to false teaching that is right the Roman Catholics don't believe that God is in his word no sir if they did they would have to repent and back up but they say God is not in his church they would make the The Bible History of the Catholic Church uh uh uh they they would make yeah the Bible the history of the Catholic church that isn't so look look what they did to water baptism alone they took it away from the Christian baptism and made it a pagan one of titles let me tell you about an experience I had with a Catholic priest a girl that I had baptized at one time turned Catholic so the priest wanted to interview me about her he asked what kind kind of baptism uh she had and I told him I baptized her in Christian baptism which is the only kind there was to my knowledge I had baptized her in the in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the priest remarked to me that that at one time the Catholic Church did that right away I asked him when the cathol uh uh when the Catholic Church did that for I've read their histories and I could not find what he said he told that it was found in the Bible and that Jesus had organized the Catholic church and I asked him if he thought Peter was really the first pope and he emphatically said that Peter was I asked him if the masses were said in Latin in order to ensure that they were U that they were correct and and would never change and he said that was true I told him that I thought they had wanted a long way from what they had at the beginning I let him know that if the Catholic Church really beli the book of Acts that I'm an old-fashioned Catholic he told me that the Bible was the record of the Catholic church and that God was in the church I disagreed with them for God is in his word let God be true but every man a liar if you take away or add to that book God has promised that he will add plagues to those who add and take away from their part uh uh away their part from The Book of Life if they they dare subtract from it Revelations 22:18 to9 let me just show how the Catholic Church believes that God is in the church instead of the word here is an excerpt from the Diary of Pope John the 23rd my experience during these three years as Pope since in fear and trembling I accepted this service in pure obedience to the Lord's will conveyed to me through the sacred College of cardinals in Enclave Bears witness to this Maxim and is a moving and Lasting reason for me to be true to it absolute trust in God in all that concerns the present and perfect Tranquility as regards the future now this pulpe states that God spoke through the church revealing his will how false god is in his word and speaks by the word revealing his will he also stated that he placed absolute trust in the word of men and thereby obeyed it with Tranquility it sounds so beautiful but it is so false just like the Pres uh the perversion of the Garden of Eden now let us go over here in Revelation 17 and see what the woman the church who is living in on false prophecies and not the word of God in verse one God calls her the great why is she the because she is in idolatry she has caught the people up into the same thing what's the cure for idolatry the word of God so this woman is a because she has left the word there she sits upon many Waters which means the multitudes of people this surely has to be the false church because the Church of God is small uh uh and and a few there be that find it notice that she is like in the uh what she is like in the eyes of God no matter how wonderful she looks to people and how philosophical she sounds she is filthy drunk on her fornications she was drunk with the blood of the martyrs just like Jezebel who killed the prophets and priest and destroyed the people of God Who Would Not Bow Down and Worship baale that is exactly what the Catholic Church did they killed those that would not bow to the popish rule those who wanted the word of God instead of the words of men were put to death usually by cruel methods but this church that dealt in death was dead herself and didn't know it there was no life in her and no signs ever followed her amen so so how many how many's understanding so far now when you do a history and we're going to get into that as as we move on into the thine tyon Church age we will see amen that she as as she be to teach not only did she teach in that age but her teachings that she taught the Trinity the Trinity was never in the Bible it's hereo Israel the Lord our God is one Lord Thou shalt have no other gods beside me there there is and there's and there's there's just numerous scriptures that God says there is no other God beside me no not one I know not any that's almost an exact quote there there are there are are all these scriptures so what we do is if and and what they done they they they made the three Gods to where you're having to worship father Son and Holy Ghost instead of understanding that it was the great father God that was over Israel that came down and and and and built a a a body that amen uh ignited the sea created an egg and put a and put a a seed of his own the Bible says Jesus was had the very blood of God he did not have the blood of a man the Bible says he had a blood of God Jesus was born not of a man he he was born of God God created a body and then God moved in that body so when you look at Jesus the son amen the Bible says that he embodied the fullness of God so the scripture says all this is what the Bible says all the fullness of God if you can find that sister keys can you can you put that up there amen there in first Timothy I believe it is amen the fullness of God dwelt bodily in Jesus Christ amen so so now here is that now Jesus has went back and he is he is uh uh interceding for you and me he is preparing a place but the Bible says that the spirit that was in Jesus has now come back upon us and we that is called the baptism of the Holy Ghost the it's this same God God living in different bodies it's not God in the body of Jesus walking on earth now now it's God in the body of you God in the body of me through the Holy Ghost so it is one God it was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself and then there in 1 Corinthians amen 5 it says know ye not that you are the Temple of that almighty God hallelujah so what is God so God's not just simply wanting to be worshiped amen we can worship the Trinity and and we can do all of that and you're missing the whole thing that what God is doing it was it was God so missing his people God so missing his sons and daughters that he that he wanted to come he wanted to be a man he wanted to he wanted to feel like you he wanted he wanted to know your hardships so he come and lived Among Us in a human being which was the body of Jesus Christ he paid the price went to hell paid the price for your sins and has now went back to Heaven he's come Sent His holy spirit back upon you to bring you unto it what a beautiful plan for Redemption amen do you love him now but these wanted to make God dead or just a a fiction so now we have now am man they're introducing uh praying to idols and they're introducing all of the these things why am man CU they ain't got no the spirit of God in their lives you see what I'm saying I think we need the spirit of the Lord in us with everything that we have we should strive for the spirit of the Lord any questions as right now where we're at praise the Lord all right now let's let's go on um let's let's go on down space to repent Revelations 2: 21 I gave her space to repent of her for fornication and she repented not do you know that this church was actually more wicked than Ahab do you know that he repented for a while and walked softly before God you can't say that of the Roman Catholic Church no sir she has never repented she but has stubbornly destroyed any and all who tried to help her repent that is history now God kept raising up not only the messengers to age but he raised up other wonderful helpers for those uh Messengers he gave every age some wonderful men of God that did everything they could to bring the church back to God God certainly gave her an opportunity and helped to repent did she ever repent and show that she and show she did by our fruits no sir she never has and she never will she is drunk she has lost her senses in spiritual things now don't be confused and start thinking that the Church of Rome has repented of her Slaughter of the Saints because she has attempted to unite with the Protestants by making her Creeds to line up uh with the Protestant Creeds not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for her mass murders she won't either no matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time she will yet raise up to kill for murder lies in her evil and unrepentant heart can you say Amen now it it was something that's that's that's lying in her now I I I want I I want to just stop for a moment here because um uh brother brandom dealt with this at length or took a half a page here on this she's never repented never repented and and it and and I think it's I think it's important because you know if you'd go back I think it's page uh 355 uh in if you were to turn back to 355 it's it's talking to our age here in in Leota this leosan age and I and it's uh one to3 um he he he's he speaks out the holy spirit is speaking straight to the church about repentance it says be zalias and repent he says now this false church has Zeal make no mistake about that her Zeal has literally been that of the Jews John 2:17 the Zeal of thy house hath eaten me up but it is a wrong Zeal it is it is for the house of her their own building it is for their own Creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness they have put the word out for their own ideas they have deposed the holy the Holy Ghost and made men into leaders they have uh put aside the eternal life as a person and make it good works or or even uh or uh Church Conformity rather than good works now I want you to catch that they have put aside eternal life as a person God is calling for another Zeal it is the Zeal to cry I am wrong wrong now who is going to say that he is wrong is it that all these denominations are based upon the claimed originality and that of God the claim that they are right now they all cannot be right in fact not one of them is right they are Whited seers full of dead men's bones they have no life they have no Vindication God has never made himself known in any organization they say they are right because they are the ones that are saying it but saying it doesn't make it so they need the Vindication the Vindicated thus saith the Lord of God and they don't have it now let me say this here I don't believe that God is calling only to the false Church to repent in this verse he is talking to his elect they have some repenting to do too many of his children are still in those false churches and they are those of whom it speaks of and in Ephesians 5:14 awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light to be asleep is not to be dead these are sleeping amongst the dead they are out there in the dead denominations they are floating along with them but God cries wake up repent of your Folly here they are lending their influence giving their time and their money and actually their their lives to this Antichrist organizations and all the while thinking it is all right they need to repent they must repent they need to have a change of mind and turn toward truth yes this is the age that most needs to repent but will it will it bring back the word will it again enthrone the holy spirit in men's lives will it again rever Jesus as the only savior I say not for the next verse reveals the astounding and shocking truth of the close of this age can you say amen and so uh uh and then there was another one while we're while we're over here let's look here at 359 and go all the way down to the last paragraph down there it says oh elect of God beware study closely be careful this is 359 work out your salvation with fear and trembling rely upon God and be strong in his mind your adversary the devil is is even now going about like a roaring lion seeing seeking whom he may devour watch under prayer and be steadfast This is the End Time both the true and the false Vine are coming into maturity but before the wheat matures those rip and tears must be bound for the burning see they are all joining the World Council of churches and that is The Binding soon the garnering of the wheat will come but right now the two Spirits are at work in the two Vines come out from amongst the tears and start to overcome that you may be considered praiseworthy for your lord and fit to Reign and Rule with him can you say Amen so the there's there's going to be one thing that is that is that is going to identify amen the elect of God is the elect of God it's not that we weren't born in in in a body of Decay it wasn't that we were that that in other words it wasn't that we were born Christians it wasn't that we were born uh goody T shoes we were all Sinners but yet there is an eternal seed of God the Bible says that you were predestinated by God before the foundation of the world Amen not because of of your good not because of your evil amen there in there in Romans the 9th chapter deals with that that there that there is a the elect of God Amen God seen you God the Bible says there in in in Revelations 13 that God put your name on his book before the world ever began and there's going to be a certain quality to the elect and that des and that is the desire to be right that's going to set you apart from everything else and that's not you demanding your rights it's it's you wanting to be right with God Amen every one of us what sets me apart from from from the religion out there is the reality that I am wrong in in myself there is nothing about me that I can rely on nothing about me that I can rely on I must rely upon him and when I do that and I come in the light of when I come and I see myself in the light of the that great that that great holy fire then it then it lets me know amen I I I've got a long ways to go and that I need to repent repentance is is is it's it's a quality that only the elect can do Cain could not do it the Serpent's children cannot do it amen but God has given you and me amen that special ingredient our desire I must be right and you know what for those of you for those of you that have that kind of a desire you know what that is sounding like that's like a that that's like your wife wanting to please you amen it's not like she's having to go around and say sorry all the time it's that her desire is to please you she wants she's not going to uh she's not chasing other guys she's going to be true to her vows her desire is to to to uh uh to to nurture you and to uh uh you know to to to be that help meat to you and to uh uh she she knows her role is is amen she's nothing without you in this world of feminism amen remember Ju Just remember when God created the the the mail baboon he took a piece of dirt and he made the mail baboon then he took another piece of dirt and he made the female baboon and then he came over here and picked up a piece of dirt and and and made the male giraffe and then he came over and grabbed another piece of dirt and made a female giraffe he he he when he wanted a dog he created took a little piece of dirt and and created the male dog took another piece of dirt created the female dog but when he created Eve he did not take another piece of Earth he put Adam to sleep and took out of Adam that rib and he created a help meet and then when Adam looks and says she is bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh can you say Amen her name was Adam amen she wasn't given the name Eve until after uh after the first baby was born then amen she was called Eve she was the mother of all living right amen So Adam so it so is the Bride of Jesus Christ we came out of Christ when Jesus was hanging on Calvary amen and they they took the uh uh uh the the cruel Roman sword and they they they they they speared him and they crucified him and they put him in the ground Hallelujah when he rose up oh 10 days later the Bible says the Holy Ghost fell down on on on the uh on the elect Amen on on the 120 there in the upper room what was it they were the Bride of Jesus their desires they weren't made of another piece of dirt they came from God they came out of God their desire was to please the Lord amen and sisters amen this feminist movements got it's all messed up they've got your husband out there making his career and then you've got to get out there and make your career and the feminist movement are finding out they those those girls are are they they're just they're unhappy they're unfulfilled it's all why because God created the woman not out of a different piece of dirt he created the woman out of the man and the only way she's ever going to be her fulfillment come to her fullest fulfillment is to serve her husband serve her family take care of the children amen keep be the queen of the house and I just want to tell you today the only way that the that the church will ever have a fulfillment and their true fulfillment is when they find themselves in the Lord Jesus Christ and giving their their honor to him their love to him serving him what do you want me to do today what can I do for you what Lord let me let I want you to smile on me today I want my attit udes to please you today I want everything about me to be all in you can you say Amen now I think that's that's that's the beautiful thing now amen in in in proving his word uh the prophet said he he said now if thou be the Son of God he always he's always doubted it and he still teaches others to doubt it he taught Eve to doubt it taught Moses he taught all them to try to doubt it he's teaching you to try to doubt it and then and you that's sitting here right now if you want me to call you your names it's it's been Satan's been trying a long time to get you to doubt me don't don't you do that sister if you do that well not me amen but just believe the word you don't have to believe me but you but you believe this if if I say this word it's not mine it's his my word's different but this is his can you say amen amen now I I want us to I I I want us to see here because uh before we read on matters of fact um uh we we won't read we we'll we'll just make this the end of our reading of the church age book and then we'll start the sentence against the Harlot and uh get in some uh some other good meat on Wednesday night but you you when we when we look at the uh at this at this this this woman this church who claims to be the Queen of Heaven claims to be and yet her devotion is not to her Lord she claims she's his but she does everything she she and everything she does is is to tear down what he's already put here right do you understand that if you're going to be a Christian and if you're going to be the Bride of Jes Jesus Christ then it's you're why do you take on your husband's name Why do why does the why does the woman put the veil over her head and after the marriage the veil comes off and it used to they would take the woman would take that Veil off and then put it around the shoulders of her of her husband that that was that was a symbol that I am losing my identity I'm taking on your identity and just as I'm taking this Veil off and putting it around your shoulders I am your responsibility all right amen you just remember that amen I am your respon you you got to take care of all my debt you got to take care of my clothes you got to take care of it I am yours I'm your responsibility I'm going to take on on your name and I'm going to honor you love you serve you but I just want you to know amen that I'm all yours and God want to tell you right now Christ loves that Christ paid the price he took care of all of your debt all of your sin all of your wrongs Christ took it all and says I will take care of the debt I will pay it I just want you to be my bride then what right do you have Amen to to allow anything to come in between that sweetness of spirit in your heart can you see man uh brother brenon would say in in U you must be born again he said he says now as the prophet goes on speaking he says who can bring a clean thing out of a good out of an unclean not one and he's one Speaking That Old Testament scripture he says you stick your bucket down into the well and pull out a bucket of water and it's stagnant it stinks you look in it and it's muddy little worms is in the water there's no way at all to put your bucket back and get clean water the whole well is contaminated the whole soul mind and body of the man is contaminated with sin he's born in sin physically shapen in iniquity and comes to the world speaking lies that's his own soul is contaminated nothing good one cannot redeem the other because it's all wrong you can't take a bucket of water here that's contaminated and another bucket of water that's contaminated and mix them together you got more contamination there's no purification to it but God determined to save men can I hear an amen he placed upon him the iniquity of us all the penalty of sin and when you're that when that you were born in the penalty of sin is death sin is death the penalty was so great that there's none of us could ever help the other there's so there's there had to be someone who could pay this penalty what if this morning the penalty to leave this room was hundred billion and there's none of us that could leave because there's none of us uh uh worth that but then if one come in who was worth enough to pay it all for us it takes one we can't do it it took the one who was worthy oh how I wish I could stop here for a while and go back and pick up Ruth and Naomi and show how the kinsman redeemer to the redeem Fallen estate had to be first worthy had to be a Kinsman therefore God the spirit Jehovah became Kinfolk To Us by taking on the form of Flesh he he become kin folk had to be that then he had to and then he had to be worthy he is the one who produced the fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins he was the one who bore all our iniquities can you say Amen now he says now denominations this broken sister 64 denominations make stagnant pools where man can live with women and women can carry on and cut their hair wear their short anything else call themselves Christians but a genuine Fountain Hallelujah the power of God it can't stay there it pushes it out I'm the Fountain of the Living Waters they they left me to dig some sisters now a a live a Fountain of Living Waters we find out what a Fountain of Living Water it it we find out that it's what the sister is now what is the Fountain of Living Waters it's an artisian well what is an artisian well it's it's a well that's always comes from beneath and pushes its water out it's flowing all the time it is self-supporting always fresh and clean an artisian well a Fountain of Living Water it's not dead and stagnated it's living it's constantly changing bringing up something new all the time moving on coming from its resources it it draws his resources from its bed and still a Fountain of Living Water sprang up self-cleansing it's clean it's pure clean water it's self-supporting you don't have to wait for the rains to fill up the tank it's always a bubbling up and it gives you water free you don't have to pump it wind it twist it join it it's just a Fountain of Living Waters the Living God forsaken so you you can have man-made dogmas but why that when you can have a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ a a relationship that relationship and and and and now now remember amen this old this old body is this old flesh you know I I think there in James uh uh James James one you know it talks about how that you can't you can't tame the tongue remember that you know or or James James 3 you you can't tame the tongue uh uh clay won't you put that up there just real quickly it's that's that's just flesh you can't tame it God don't want you taming it God wants that something on the inside just pushing this pushing this through out there and and and you can see it behold we put horses in uh bits in horses' mouth and they obey us and we turn about their whole body it says behold also the ships which are so great are driven by the fierce winds and has a very small Helm and then uh the next verse and then but he says the tongue is a little member boasteth great things behold how great a manner a little fire kindleth he says and the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity so is the tongue among our members that it defileth the whole body Seth on fire the course of Nature and is set on fire of Hell amen keep on going but every for every kind of Beast and birds and serpents and things of the sea is tamed and they and have been tamed of mankind but the tongue can no man tame it's an unruly evil full of deadly poison there therewith we bless God even the father and therewith we curse men which are made after the similitude of God out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing my brethren these things ought not so to be do a fountain send forth at the same place Sweetwater and bitter who is wise and endued with knowledge among you let him show out of a good lifestyle conversation lifestyle his works with meekness of wisdom if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is Earthly cenal devilish where envy and strife is there is confusion and every evil work but the wisdom which comes from above is is is first pure then Peaceable uh peaceful gentle easy to be treated uh full of Mercy good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy for the root of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace and whence comes Wars and fightings among you they uh come they not hints even of your own lust that war in your members oh that's okay amen and so uh uh so we we we can see that that artisian well in the soul is so important now the church system is trying to take care of this Spirit man and this body without the conversion of the Soul so they're doing it they're they've got their programs they have substituted The Living artisian Well the spirit of God that requires a man to walk close with God do you see that so so we as a as Believers tonight we don't want to be amen don't don't do not be satisfied coming to church and thinking this is all there is to it and not having a relationship with Jesus Christ a relationship in on a daily basis is important you are the bride of Jesus Christ the Antichrist Spirit has taken the relationship away and has put it on works well I do this and I do that and I do this and I do that and so I'm a Christian you're only a Christian you're only the bride as you are walking with Jesus Christ so that Christ that is living on the see they substitute Ed you you have substituted the the Fountain of Living Water and you have hued to yourself these sisters and that's what those that's what the church has done music light shows programs all of this thing is taking away from God and they think they're married to Jesus when Jesus is wanting to be made flesh in you and the only way he can be made flesh in you is for you to surrender your life to him and the only way you can Surrender Your Life to him is in know is is an act of repentance and a crying out I'm wrong I need you Lord I Need Your Presence I need your spirit I need you I want your presence are y'all understanding I want your presence more than I want anything else I've got to have your presence if your presence isn't with me that I I am I am messed up brother I can't I can't leave my I can't leave my wife uh uh alone too very long amen I don't like it when I'm when I'm away from her and I don't like it when she's away from me and and you know what because she's my girl I I I don't I don't want to talk to anybody else I don't want to hug on nobody else I don't want to hold no one else's hand I want my girlfriend which my wife amen I want her more than I want anything else amen precious bride of Jesus Christ amen Jezebel is claiming that she is his bride hallelujah amen she's claiming but there's only one that's going to be those that want to please him if the mus I would come now are there any questions that's some strong winds out there folks amen yeah yeah I I love I there there's one thing that that that comforts me and and and and and it will give into it this next this next uh Wednesday night and and that is I the the uh uh God knows them that are his and he will not lose the one and the one that that has that has orchestrated your life and has brought you through the course your course that wasn't you you're not smart enough to do it it was the hand of the almighty God that's and all of God's sheep are going to hear his voice it's not important that they hear my voice it's not important that they hear your voice unless the Lord is dealing with you to share it with them and and that's where I think that we need to be really sensitive to the Lord say Lord let my life be such a reflection that the guys on the job they're they're going to see Jesus in me amen I I think and I I I think a lot of you guys all work work together there with brother Michael and them and what a blessing yall are what a blessing yall have to be able to Believers to work together I'm going to tell you the the construction this construction field is can can be some of the most vulgar guys working in that you know and you all are blessed to be able to to fellowship with one another on those basis but whether you have a brother sitting beside you or whether you don't whether you have a sister that's with you or whether you don't we want we want we want the spirit of the Lord to flow through me and operate through me and love through me and correct me when I'm wrong and lift me up help me to overcome where I need to overcome amen and if the and and I I every elect is going to have that desire and if they've got that Des I don't think I don't think anything of our past is ever in vain I think God allows us to go through those things so that when we come into a a a more clear path with him that we'll love love him even that much the more I thank God for those things I I thank God that he allowed me to go through things in my life because I and I and I'm and I going to tell you why because it's created and and when I look back and I see what he has done for me I got more of an intense desire to please him today than I've ever had I want to please the Lord I want to be right I want my heart to be right I want I want to preach right I want to I want to live the right kind of an example I want I want to be the right kind of a husband right kind of a pastor right kind of wherever it is whatever God has waned me and placed me here on Earth to do I want everything to please him and I think if you

leads me I will follow where he [Music] leads I I will follow yes I will I'll go with him with him oh all the way I'll go with him through hard trials I'll go with [Music] through yes I will yes I
