[16:27] couldn't see nothing and suddenly
[16:29] neighbors watched him as he was trying
[16:31] to play with the other kids and
[16:32] everything and you know and it would it
[16:34] it cost a lot to have a operation to
[16:36] correct and try to get them cataracts
[16:38] done off of his eyes so he could see and
[16:41] his parents couldn't uh couldn't afford
[16:43] it they just poor and poor so all the

[16:48] let's plant some extra crops this year
[16:50] and the money we make off them extra
[16:52] crops will pay for Benji or Benny to get
[16:56] that operation so they sent them off on
[16:59] a train to get the operation done and he
[17:02] was as he was coming back the people

[42:31] through us all father and we'll give you
[42:34] glory and honor in the name of the Lord
[42:36] Jesus can the church say amen amen and
[42:40] amen God bless you you can be seated
[42:42] here tonight amen we um want a minister
[42:47] here tonight uh on a simple a simple
[42:51] thought submission to the
[42:54] Potter amen submission to the Potter and
[42:57] it is good to see brother Josh and
[42:59] sister Loretta they they went uh to uh
[43:02] they ministered for Brother Sam Parker
[43:04] this morning and so good to have them uh
[43:07] back here for the service I know it's
[43:09] hard when you leave so early and and U
[43:12] he was just they were just skidding in
[43:14] here um just right before church and so
[43:18] we're glad to see you all back amen but
[43:22] um uh submission to the Potter I I I
[43:27] think um as we as we have talked a
[43:30] little lately about character and and
[43:34] growth and
[43:36] maturity I I think the there's there's a
[43:39] word that we need to use and
[43:42] that's
[43:44] pliability amen being
[43:47] pliable the quality of being Supple
[43:51] enough to bend freely or repeatedly
[43:55] without breaking
[43:57] and and I I think that's that is a
[43:59] requirement for every one of us as as
[44:02] Christians in our growth amen is is
[44:06] there has got to be appli leness in our
[44:10] heart we don't want to be um so set in
[44:14] our ways so set in our experience that
[44:18] we um that we can't grow because growth
[44:22] is part of Amen uh maturity amen and and
[44:28] not
[44:29] necessarily maturity is not
[44:32] necessarily uh uh there's there's a lot
[44:36] of there's there's there's a lot of
[44:38] grown men that aren't mature there's a
[44:41] lot of grown women that aren't mature
[44:44] and so we don't want to say that I've
[44:47] been you know I I've been a Christian
[44:50] for um years without maturity we don't
[44:55] want to be uh sitting on the sideline uh
[44:59] and saying I'm just a child so amen I
[45:03] don't have to worry about maturity no
[45:06] God is calling us all into maturity and
[45:09] we're all going to make a Rapture
[45:11] whether you're a kid or whether you're a
[45:13] hundred years old we have all got to
[45:16] mature in the Lord amen so another
[45:21] another definition for pliability is is
[45:24] the capacity to yield to another it is
[45:29] stretchable to be flexible to be
[45:33] workable now uh pability is opposite of
[45:37] stiff neck amen a stiff neck is hotti it
[45:41] is stubborn amen it is it is set in in
[45:47] their way acts
[45:49] 7:49 amen uh it says Heaven is my Throne
[45:54] Earth is my foot stol what how house
[45:57] will you build me saith the Lord or what
[46:00] is the place of my rest hath not my hand
[46:05] made all these things ye stiff neck and
[46:09] uncircumcised in heart and in ears ye do
[46:12] always resist the Holy Ghost even as
[46:16] your father did so do ye can you say
[46:20] Amen so we want to be pliable there in
[46:23] in Isaiah 54 and the 16th chapter
[46:27] the the Isaiah God speaking through
[46:30] Isaiah says I have created the
[46:33] Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire
[46:37] now I want you to say I have created I
[46:41] see it is God speaking saying I have
[46:44] created the Smith that that is blowing
[46:47] coals in the fire amen and that brings
[46:51] forth an instrument for his work I and I
[46:55] have created the waster to destroy so
[46:59] God is the one who has ordained things
[47:02] in our lives to bring about uh uh the
[47:07] the The Treasure of his nature within
[47:11] each one of us I've created the Smith
[47:14] that blows the coast I've created the
[47:16] waster to destroy I have brought this
[47:19] thing in why because there are things in
[47:21] our carnal walk in our carnal nature
[47:24] that has to burn that has to fall short
[47:29] so that he can bring an instrument of
[47:31] his glory within us you see the designer
[47:36] of you built you to respond to the word
[47:40] of this day amen when God designed you
[47:43] when God built you he designed you to be
[47:47] able to respond to the word to respond
[47:51] to correction to respond to the holy
[47:54] spirit because that's the only way that
[47:58] he's going to have a bride without spot
[48:00] or wrinkle that's the only way there's
[48:03] going to be a Rapture is the when God
[48:05] designs you he didn't just place you
[48:08] here just to be here he's placed you
[48:10] here to reflect his glory reflect his
[48:13] purpose in this generation and it's got
[48:17] to be of his own choosing his own making
[48:21] can you say amen amen so when he builds
[48:24] you to respond to the word of this day
[48:26] that means you are soft that means you
[48:28] are workable that means you there's no
[48:32] resistances in your will to his will
[48:35] amen there is one desire God I want your
[48:40] you I want your reflection in me
[48:43] whatever you've called me for whatever
[48:45] you've designed me for whatever I I want
[48:48] your will to be expressed through me can
[48:51] you say amen amen I think this is this
[48:54] is important because amen it is God that
[48:57] prepares the beding crowns and amen he
[49:00] plants you according to his eternal
[49:03] purpose amen and you you are are are in
[49:06] amen uh in your body in in a full of
[49:11] emotion and full of decisions and and
[49:14] and and and you're full of the ups and
[49:17] the downs and you're full of you you're
[49:19] full of Pride you're full of Amen uh uh
[49:23] I I thought brother brother David
[49:24] reminded me this morning that the the
[49:26] the first time that brother brandham and
[49:28] actually a couple times when brother
[49:30] brandham talked about um the story that
[49:32] we that we expressed here this morning
[49:35] he titled the sermon Pride amen it was
[49:38] pride and every time he's going back he
[49:39] goes back to Pride and how that Pride
[49:43] keeps us from coming and giving
[49:45] everything that we've got coming into
[49:47] his presence Pride keeps us from
[49:49] surrendering and offering the thing that
[49:51] we hold as a treasure the thing that we
[49:54] hold as valuable the thing that we're
[49:57] trying to hold on to you've got to come
[50:00] and and and Lay It All Before the feet
[50:02] of Jesus Christ knowing that Christ has
[50:05] everything for our lives can you say
[50:07] amen amen but you're in this body you
[50:10] you you are amen but it is that soul
[50:14] that is soft it's that soul that is
[50:17] pliable God created you with the ability
[50:23] to to to surrender to his will amen now
[50:29] amen so when God equips you when God
[50:31] brings you here on the earth he plants
[50:34] you according to that Divine Purpose
[50:37] amen now he places you where you can
[50:39] grow he places you where you can
[50:42] flourish he gives you amen he gives you
[50:45] kids a a a good home he gives you a good
[50:48] pastor he gives you a good youth leader
[50:51] he gives you good friends he gives you
[50:54] these things but the the the key
[50:56] ingredient is are you willing to be
[51:01] tutored by the Holy Spirit where he has
[51:05] placed you are you willing to be taught
[51:09] on it's not good enough for the for the
[51:12] pastor to have the anointing and the
[51:14] pastor to to desire and the pastor to
[51:17] flow it is got to be your desire Amen to
[51:22] to achieve the desires that God has
[51:26] placed in that local group God has
[51:29] placed that desire God has placed that
[51:32] Vision God places those things and it's
[51:35] our desire to be pliable so that his
[51:38] anointing can work through me amen
[51:42] hallelujah places you young people in
[51:44] there with your youth group amen not
[51:46] when not when the youth leaders you know
[51:47] gets up and says all right well we don't
[51:49] see it that way we don't want to do it
[51:51] that way we don't well you know you're
[51:53] not being pliable amen well that's just
[51:56] you well you're God gives us leaders and
[52:01] he expects us to be pliable to his
[52:05] will amen but we're living in a day
[52:08] where there's not there there's no such
[52:11] thing as leadership because no one wants
[52:12] to follow there's no such thing as
[52:15] leadership because no one has the
[52:17] courage to lay it all
[52:20] down so that we can follow God's will
[52:24] can you say Amen but God places you in
[52:29] the in the grounds where you can
[52:32] flourish now I want you to think about
[52:34] that now because amen where you are
[52:37] where you are right now is so important
[52:40] where you are as a Believer is so
[52:42] important where you're setting the trial
[52:45] you're looking at the situations that
[52:48] that God places in your life is so very
[52:51] important to God because God is trying
[52:55] to mold something
[52:57] within you as his believer a praise the
[53:00] name of the Lord amen the scripture says
[53:03] there in Ezekiel 17 and8 that it they're
[53:05] talking about the church it was planted
[53:08] in a good soil by Great Waters that it
[53:12] might bring forth branches that it might
[53:15] bear fruit that it might be a Godly Vine
[53:19] well glory to God it's God that plants
[53:22] this it's God that puts that in there so
[53:26] that you and I will surrender our Wills
[53:31] to the Lord Jesus
[53:33] Christ amen now we want things to come
[53:36] in a supernatural way where we're where
[53:38] we're feeling we're shaken and we're we
[53:40] got we're speaking in tongues that's the
[53:42] way we was in in Pentecost amen it has
[53:45] to come and we we feel the vibration no
[53:49] God sends the situation and he expects
[53:52] you to yield yourself to his word come
[53:56] on he expects every one of us hallelujah
[54:00] somebody say let me
[54:02] yield to his way Amen to cultivate Amen
[54:08] to cultivate that ground planting seeds
[54:10] has got to be in a cultivated ground not
[54:13] going to hold you long here tonight but
[54:14] I just want to leave this to you
[54:16] cultivate is to break up the F ground
[54:19] that means you got to you got to you got
[54:20] to get in there and cultivate you got to
[54:22] get in there and God comes in and and
[54:24] and he takes his tractor amen and and he
[54:27] takes the tiller and and he and he goes
[54:30] through that hard ground and he goes
[54:32] over it and over it and over it and over
[54:35] it because he wants that ground to be
[54:38] soft he wants that ground to be pliable
[54:42] he wants to plant some good seed in that
[54:46] ground and when there's good seed in
[54:49] that cultivated ground then you become
[54:53] the Accord according to his wisdom you
[54:56] become come amen a masterpiece you
[54:58] become a vessel unto
[55:02] water come on now a vessel unto
[55:06] H sometimes we look at elders and we say
[55:09] oh I wish I could be like you no you
[55:11] don't because if you did want to be like
[55:13] that person you'd be willing to go
[55:15] through the trials that that person has
[55:16] went through well I wish I could I wish
[55:20] I could be used like that minister no
[55:22] you don't because God sends situations
[55:24] your way and you're not willing to give
[55:27] that's right come on now but there's
[55:29] only one way to grow and that's through
[55:32] the power of His word in a
[55:37] pliable
[55:39] heart amen
[55:42] now special
[55:44] attention has been given to the

[56:36] Nathaniel happen to pull it back a
[56:38] little bit and amen set it back down and
[56:41] and tilling that ground you see now now
[56:44] the ground was hard and the ground was
[56:47] either going to resist or the ground was
[56:50] going to be pliable yeah all right on
[56:54] praise the Lord
[56:56] that ground was chosen by
[57:00] Nathaniel that ground was a piece of
[57:02] ground he he he decided not to put it in
[57:06] those raised beds or whatever those
[57:08] pretty things y'all got out there he
[57:10] chose that ground on the backside of
[57:13] that and he put the tiller in that
[57:15] ground so that he can put the seeds in
[57:19] that ground so that that ground can
[57:22] produce the fruit that he desires am
[57:26] come on now but it
[57:28] requires somebody killing that ground

[57:40] is coming in Lord come down my road God

[58:17] kids sitting here and I wanted to bring
[58:19] this in because oh I know we've got some
[58:22] 10 11 12 year olds here and brother
[58:25] brandom says I I noticed last night
[58:28] there's a little girl sitting here looks
[58:30] to be about 10 years old and she raised
[58:33] her hand a few minutes ago she wanted
[58:36] Jesus about the age of my little Becky I
[58:39] guess at home my little Rebecca and I
[58:43] noticed the little girl come up last
[58:45] night when she stood at the altar no
[58:48] more than she stood there she started
[58:51] speaking in
[58:52] tongues and someone told me some of the
[58:54] Brethren that she was running all over
[58:56] the church and speaking in tongues and
[58:58] singing in tongues and everything and
[59:01] how the Lord blessed that
[59:03] child get her when her heart's young and
[59:06] tender before she's pulled through the
[59:08] old TR stories and magazines and the
[59:12] filth of the world and got her heart all

[59:29] would never take back my raising as a
[59:31] young man being raised on on the pews of
[59:35] the church I would never take back my
[59:37] training from my father who taught me
[59:40] how to be a servant my mother amen and
[59:43] taught me how to be a servant I would
[59:45] never take back the trials that I've
[59:48] gone through even as a kid I would never
[59:50] want to take back Lord knows I wouldn't
[59:53] go want to go back through them again
[59:54] but I would never I would never take
[59:57] back amen the the situations that I've
[1:00:00] gone through as as a pastor as a
[1:00:03] Christian as a man amen you know why
[1:00:06] because I believe that the footsteps of
[1:00:08] a good man are ordered of the Lord and I
[1:00:11] believe that nothing comes my way except
[1:00:14] God is working on wend Martin I don't
[1:00:17] believe anything comes my way amen but
[1:00:19] what God is moving upon me that's the

[1:00:37] years there's one thing that I can say
[1:00:39] I'm thankful that God chose this piece
[1:00:43] of ground to work his will through and
[1:00:48] then I'm thankful that God chose
[1:00:52] me to work that in because amen I want
[1:00:56] to be something of his glory I can't do
[1:00:59] it as long as I'm still holding my peace
[1:01:01] back and say but but but no if I'm going
[1:01:04] to be a sheep I'm going to have to give
[1:01:06] my wo I'm going to have to surrender I'm
[1:01:09] going to have to well can you say Amen
[1:01:12] now I want you to look because God has
[1:01:15] prepared you with that
[1:01:18] softness but Satan wants to come in and
[1:01:20] he'll try to take that softness
[1:01:22] too and this is where I I hit all the
[1:01:25] time time on those games
[1:01:28] hallelujah amen so I hit all the time on
[1:01:31] on the gaming and on the uh the the the
[1:01:34] internet and those those kinds of things
[1:01:37] God has prepared your heart to be
[1:01:41] soft Satan wants to take your soft heart
[1:01:46] and place his junk
[1:01:50] in amen he wants to do it now Noah's Arc
[1:01:54] was made of gopher wood it was a soft
[1:01:57] wood it was light and
[1:01:59] pliable amen it was a type of what God
[1:02:03] was building in his church the ark now I
[1:02:06] want you to look at this gopher wood for
[1:02:08] just a moment no other wood would
[1:02:11] do God didn't allow any other wood he
[1:02:15] wanted gopher wood gopher wood was the
[1:02:19] was the most porous of wood gopher wood
[1:02:24] would would just soak
[1:02:27] up it's the it's the last kind of wood
[1:02:31] that any smart man would use to build a
[1:02:34] boat
[1:02:35] with because it suck it would suck all
[1:02:38] the water
[1:02:40] up but God
[1:02:42] said build the
[1:02:44] boat on out of gopherwood
[1:02:48] God is saying I'm I I I'm going to call
[1:02:53] some human beings
[1:02:56] right come on and they're going to be
[1:02:57] the worst they're they're going to be
[1:03:01] the most fickle they're going to be
[1:03:03] there is no way that these folks are
[1:03:05] going to be reliable to build an ark out
[1:03:08] of but then God says I want you to take
[1:03:12] an evergreen tree and I want you to beat
[1:03:14] all that resin out of that evergreen
[1:03:16] tree beat all beat it until all of the
[1:03:19] juices and all of the resin and all of
[1:03:21] the sap comes out of that tree and then
[1:03:24] I want you to pour on to that gopher
[1:03:27] wood and the goer wood is going to suck
[1:03:31] it all
[1:03:33] up but after the gopher wood is all
[1:03:36] sealed with that sap then that gopher
[1:03:39] wood will stand the test of time it'll
[1:03:43] go 40 days of rain it'll it'll well
[1:03:47] praise the name of the Lord God chose
[1:03:49] the go Forwood to build that Arc out of
[1:03:53] that it's a type of you and me amen
[1:03:56] we're either going to suck in all of the
[1:03:58] all of the tribulation Waters or we are
[1:04:00] going to repel the tribulation Waters it
[1:04:03] all depends on our
[1:04:06] ability to really look deep in our
[1:04:09] hearts remove all the pride and then
[1:04:12] submit can you say
[1:04:14] Amen you see why would God do that
[1:04:19] Hallelujah you kids are soft in
[1:04:23] nature God's built you to be soft God's
[1:04:27] built all of us to be
[1:04:29] soft God's built
[1:04:31] us because he wants you to soak in these
[1:04:36] words every
[1:04:38] service he wants you to listen to tapes
[1:04:40] and to be able to soak it
[1:04:43] in but we've got to be careful at what
[1:04:46] we are
[1:04:47] putting well glory to
[1:04:50] God if we're gaming all the time and
[1:04:53] we're on the internet all the time

[1:05:24] whatever you think you well the
[1:05:26] Pharisees thought they had it all and we
[1:05:29] found out they were just actors they did
[1:05:33] not have anything when it came to Jesus
[1:05:37] Christ they had the wealth they had the
[1:05:39] riches they they they had the prestige
[1:05:41] they were the leaders of the
[1:05:47] church who's the one that got it it was

[1:06:15] new life all that money and she's laying
[1:06:19] it down there little did she know that
[1:06:21] she was getting her new life in buying
[1:06:26] that bottle of
[1:06:27] ointment little did she know in the
[1:06:30] surrender of everything she had she was
[1:06:32] finding the amazing purpose that God had
[1:06:35] predestinated her for oh come on church
[1:06:39] amen I think that's beautiful and here

[1:07:08] and I and I'm looking for my scripture I
[1:07:10] must have I don't know what happened to
[1:07:12] my scripture hallelujah oh there it is
[1:07:15] there in 2 Timothy 2 and 20 it says but

[1:12:28] another preacher that got on there and
[1:12:30] he seemed to agree with them shame on
[1:12:33] him
[1:12:34] now so God wants not going to hold you
[1:12:38] long now God is looking for
[1:12:42] peness in our lives brother brother
[1:12:46] brandham would say the high priest once
[1:12:48] a year entered in the first Veil then
[1:12:50] the second Veil and on the outside at
[1:12:52] the labors where they washed the sacrif
[1:12:55] then the sacrifice was killed put on the
[1:12:57] Brazen Altar and the blood was put in a
[1:12:59] charger and the high priest once a year
[1:13:01] walked in behind the veil to make an
[1:13:03] atonement notice the dressing of the
[1:13:05] high priest before he could enter into
[1:13:07] the veil and and and I want you to catch
[1:13:09] that notice the dressing of the high
[1:13:11] priest before he can enter into the veil
[1:13:15] he had to be stripped and dressed right
[1:13:17] to go in and that's what the church is
[1:13:19] today what it needs is a stripping off
[1:13:23] of all these little Cults and things and
[1:13:24] dress in righteousness of Jesus Christ
[1:13:27] and ready to enter in he must his walk
[1:13:31] must be different along the hymns of His
[1:13:33] Garment he had a pomegranate and then a
[1:13:35] baale and when he walked his walk was so
[1:13:39] perfect until the baal's played holy
[1:13:41] holy holy unto the Lord what we need
[1:13:43] today is not another not whether we're
[1:13:46] assemblies or Church of God or Oneness
[1:13:48] whatever it might be but our walk ought
[1:13:50] to be playing to the public holy holy
[1:13:52] holy unto the Lord another thing he must
[1:13:55] be anointed before he goes in the
[1:13:57] anointing oil was made with a rose of
[1:13:59] Sharon and the crushing of the Rose
[1:14:01] brought forth the perfume and they put
[1:14:03] it on uh uh put it on the oil that run
[1:14:06] on Aaron's beard and plumbed down to the
[1:14:09] hems of his skirt and covered all over
[1:14:11] with the anointing oil walking right
[1:14:13] living right moving right dressing right
[1:14:16] and there he went taking before him the
[1:14:18] blood as he went behind the veil into
[1:14:21] that third room and there was a veil
[1:14:23] that dropped behind him that the outside
[1:14:25] world could not see him no more every
[1:14:28] man or boy or woman or girl that is ever
[1:14:31] anointed of God Walks Behind that Temple
[1:14:34] the veil of God the Holy Ghost put him
[1:14:37] in that secret place and that Veil drops
[1:14:40] behind him and the world and all the
[1:14:42] things are cut off behind
[1:14:46] him oh make me pliable make me PL I want
[1:14:51] to be able to just walk not not not not
[1:14:53] stop at the first not stop at at
[1:14:56] justification not stop at sanctification
[1:14:58] not stop at at at at at the Holy Ghost
[1:15:01] but God let me go behind that Veil and
[1:15:04] live there with you can you say amen

[1:25:48] one as I was walking out of the
[1:25:49] fellowship hall amen you see I love hot
[1:25:53] dogs and when I when I walked in I
[1:25:55] didn't even know what it was going to
[1:25:56] happen but I when I walked into that

[1:26:12] hamburgers and hot dogs I ate a hot dog
[1:26:14] amen but but you see the there is
[1:26:18] there's got to be there's got to be the
[1:26:21] hot dog right before there can be a
[1:26:24] craving there was a
[1:26:27] Creator who's got a specific design and
[1:26:32] purpose for you being here on this
[1:26:35] Earth you've got to yield yourself to
[1:26:38] that submit yourself to that and be and
[1:26:43] be willing to be
[1:26:48] tutored there's got to
[1:26:51] be
[1:26:52] now from the cre Creator's eye when he
[1:26:55] was
[1:26:56] creating he seen the grand scheme of
[1:27:00] things he seen the
[1:27:03] fall he seen what Satan would do he saw
[1:27:06] this layot Ayan age where he would be
[1:27:08] put out of the
[1:27:11] church but then he begins to design and
[1:27:14] prepares the grand scheme of things and
[1:27:17] he begins to create you and me did you
[1:27:20] know that brother brandham says if he
[1:27:21] would have had a choice of which AE
[1:27:24] which generation that he would want that
[1:27:26] he would be put in if God were to ask
[1:27:28] him before the foundation of the world
[1:27:30] you're going to be a
[1:27:32] preacher I'll let you go wherever you
[1:27:35] want brother Bram says I I would have
[1:27:38] loved to been there in the days of Jesus
[1:27:41] I would have loved to been that witness
[1:27:42] I would have loved to been one of those
[1:27:45] preachers but he says I think I would
[1:27:47] have chose this day for this day is the
[1:27:52] grandest of them
[1:27:55] all come
[1:28:01] on why he says this is a day of death
[1:28:06] this generation is
[1:28:09] dying but yet this is the greatest age
[1:28:13] to
[1:28:14] reflect Jesus
[1:28:16] Christ can you say
[1:28:19] Amen there's got to be the Crave the
[1:28:24] Serpent's
[1:28:26] children they're not going to Crave

[1:28:37] it they're going to fight and resist
[1:28:39] their Pride's going to do whatever
[1:28:41] they're going to do it's nothing going
[1:28:42] to change them the preacher could preach
[1:28:44] the rest of his life and that serpent
[1:28:46] seed is not going to change one iota
[1:28:50] they'll stay religious just like Cain
[1:28:51] was religious they'll stay religious
[1:28:53] just like
[1:28:54] uh all the rest of
