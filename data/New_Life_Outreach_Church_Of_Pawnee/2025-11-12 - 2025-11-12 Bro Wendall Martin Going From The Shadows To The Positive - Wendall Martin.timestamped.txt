[15:24] Oh, you ought to have been there
[15:28] when he saved my soul. [music]

[15:31] You ought to have been there.
[15:34] When he put my name [music]
[15:36] on the road,
[15:38] I started walking. I started [music]
[15:41] talking. I started singing. Then I
[15:44] started shouting about what the Lord has
[15:47] done for me. [music]
[15:49] [singing]
[15:50] Well, I said I wasn't going to testify,
[15:54] but I
[15:56] Oh, no. I
[15:59] [music]
[16:04] I said I wasn't going to [music]
[16:06] testify, but I
[16:10] what the Lord has done for you ought to
[16:14] been there. Oh, you ought to been there
[16:17] [music]

[16:22] Oh, you want to been there?
[16:25] When he put my name [music] on the road,
[16:28] [singing]
[16:29] I started walking. I started talking. I
[16:33] started singing. Then I started shouting

[16:50] when he put my name on [singing] the
[16:53] rope and I started walking. I started
[16:57] [music] talking. I started singing and I

[17:03] Lord has done for me. [singing]
[17:07] Oh by and by. Oh, when the morning
[17:12] [music] comes, when all the saints
[17:16] [singing] of God are headed home, we
[17:20] will [music] tell the story
[17:23] how [singing] we've overcome. [music]
[17:26] And we'll understand it by and by,
[17:32] by [music] and by, [singing]
[17:34] and by. Oh, when the morning comes, when
[17:39] all the saints [music and singing]
[17:41] of God are gathered home, we will tell
[17:46] the [singing] story [music]
[17:48] how we've overcome and we'll [music]
[17:52] understand it by and by. [singing]
[17:57] Oh, now by
[18:01] Oh, when the morning comes.
[18:07] [music]
[18:09] Oh, we will tell [music and singing] the
[18:12] story
[18:13] how we overcome and [music] we'll
[18:17] understand it better by and by. Can we
[18:20] do a verse? [music]
[18:22] They're often tossed and driven all the
[18:26] rest the same time. Summer skies and
[18:30] howling temps off the sea.
[18:34] [music] In that land of perfect day,
[18:37] when the mist have rolled away, we will
[18:41] understand it better [music and singing]
[18:43] by and by.
[18:46] Oh, now by and by. Oh,
[18:50] [music and singing] when the morning
[18:52] comes, when all the saints of God
[18:57] [music and singing] are headed home, we
[18:59] will tell the story how we've overcome
[19:05] and we'll understand it better. Can we
[19:08] do another [music] verse?
[19:11] We [singing] are often destitute of the
[19:15] things [music] that life demand. One of
[19:18] food and one of shelter, [music] thirsty
[19:21] hills and barren lands. We are trusting
[19:25] in [music] the Lord and according to his
[19:28] word. Oh, we will [music and singing]
[19:30] understand it better by and by.
[19:35] Oh, now [music and singing] by

[20:04] when the morning comes, when all
[20:07] [singing] the saints of God are headed
[20:11] [music] home, we will tell the [singing]
[20:14] story how [music] we've overcome.
[20:18] And we'll understand it better by and
[20:22] by.
[20:26] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[20:28] praise tonight?
[20:29] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. As brother John gets ready
[20:33] to come, can [music] we sing this?
[20:40] Lord, I come [singing] to you.
[20:45] Let my heart be changed,
[20:50] renewed, [singing]
[20:52] flowing from the grace
[20:57] that I found
[21:00] in
[21:02] you.
[21:11] And Lord, I've come to know [singing]
[21:16] the weaknesses I see
[21:21] in me [singing and music]
[21:24] will be stripped away
[21:31] by the power of your love. [singing]
[21:39] Oh, [singing]
[21:42] [music]
[21:44] be [singing] close.
[21:47] Let your love surround [singing]
[21:52] me.
[21:56] Bring [singing]
[21:58] [music]
[21:59] me near.
[22:02] Draw me to [music] your side.
[22:06] Yes, Lord.
[22:10] Oh,
[22:11] and as [singing]
[22:14] [music] I wait,
[22:17] I'll rise up like [music and singing]
[22:19] thee.
[22:25] And I'll sow with [singing] you. [music]
[22:29] Your spirit leads me home
[22:32] by the power of [singing] your love.
[22:39] Amen. God bless you now. [applause]
[22:49] God bless you all. I ain't much of a
[22:51] singer, but
[22:54] everything for the Lord, right?
[22:56] &gt;&gt; Hopefully I don't forget the words this
[22:58] time.
[23:03] In a lonely [singing]
[23:06] cattle stable
[23:10] in Bethlehem,
[23:11] [music]
[23:15] there are signs of new [music]
[23:19] construction
[23:22] on a mighty span. [singing]
[23:27] was in [music and singing] the heart
[23:30] of all the lost.
[23:34] cast a shadow
[23:36] of [singing] the cross
[23:40] as that baby Mary's [singing]
[23:44] c
[23:50] would soon [singing] be mer
[23:53] se
[23:59] &gt;&gt; hope was just across [music] the river
[24:04] on heaven's side.
[24:10] But we [music] were much too weak to
[24:14] swim
[24:16] and no boat to ride.
[24:22] [music]
[24:23] But God made a way [singing]
[24:26] it couldn't fail.
[24:29] A wooden cross, [singing]
[24:32] three rusty [music] nails
[24:36] on Calary's rusted
[24:39] re.
[24:45] Mercy built [singing]
[24:48] a bridge.
[24:53] You say we can cross, but we
[24:58] [singing and music] must cross a Calvary
[25:00] way
[25:06] that [music] leads from night
[25:09] into [singing]
[25:10] our brightest day.
[25:17] You see, [singing] Jesus died so that
[25:21] you and I [music and singing]
[25:24] could live.
[25:29] So leave all your guilt for mercy build
[25:35] a bridge.
[25:40] Amen.
[25:42] [applause]
[25:43] &gt;&gt; [music]
[25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. He should have kept going. Amen. I
[25:57] sure love that song. I think that's the
[25:59] first time I've heard it. That's a
[26:01] powerful song. Amen. Thank God for his
[26:03] mercy. [music] Can we sing this as
[26:06] Sister Tina, Sister Rose, and Sister
[26:07] Loretta gets ready to come? Oh, mercy.
[26:12] It [music] ruled [singing]
[26:14] my life.
[26:18] [music]
[26:20] God's mercy
[26:24] rule [singing and music]
[26:25] my life.
[26:31] And [music and singing] I should have
[26:34] fallen
[26:36] my soul [singing]
[26:39] cast [music] down.
[26:42] on mercy
[26:45] rewrote
[26:47] my [music]
[26:48] life
[26:50] once again. Now, God's
[26:52] [music and singing] mercy
[26:55] rewrote my life.
[26:59] Thank you, Lord.
[27:02] Oh, mercy, [singing and music]
[27:05] rewrote my life.
[27:12] And [singing] I should
[27:15] have fallen.
[27:18] My [music] soul [singing]
[27:20] cast down
[27:23] but [music] mercy
[27:26] rewrote [singing]
[27:28] my life.
[27:32] Amen. God bless you now.
[28:08] There I [singing and music] go falling
[28:10] down again
[28:12] trying to run a race I [music] can't win
[28:16] sometimes I just [singing] want to bow
[28:18] out
[28:20] [music]
[28:20] to throw in the towel now
[28:24] my mistakes try twisting the truth
[28:26] [singing and music]
[28:28] but I I know somebody who loves to use
[28:32] all the [music and singing] little
[28:33] broken pieces.
[28:36] You're bringing strength to my weakness.
[28:39] Oh,
[28:40] [music]
[28:41] you're telling [singing] my soul.
[28:45] [music] It's not too late. [singing]
[28:49] Even in the mess I made, I [music] turn
[28:53] around and see you [singing] standing.
[28:56] You're giving me a million chances.
[29:01] It's your [singing] grace. [music]
[29:03] Oh, grace. Oh, I'll never understand it.
[29:08] You're giving [singing] me a million
[29:10] chances.
[29:12] Keep giving me a [singing] million
[29:14] chances. [music]
[29:18] There you go. Making all things
[29:20] [singing] good.
[29:22] work it out like you said you would.
[29:26] There's no reason [singing] to doubt
[29:28] you.
[29:29] You know I can't live without you. Oh,
[29:34] [singing] you're telling my soul.
[29:39] It's not too [singing] late. Even in the
[29:43] mess I made, [music] I turn around and
[29:46] see you standing. You're [singing]
[29:49] giving me a million [music]
[29:51] chances.
[29:53] It's your [singing] grace, oh grace,
[29:56] [music] I'll never understand [singing]
[29:59] it. You're giving me a million chances.
[30:04] Keep giving me a [singing and music]
[30:05] million chances.
[30:09] Not too [singing] late. It's never too
[30:12] late. Too late. No, it's never too
[30:16] [singing] late. Too late. Wo. Not
[30:20] [singing] too late.

[32:40] peace, for providing all our needs,
[32:43] Lord, meeting our needs [music] here
[32:44] this evening, Lord. A place that we'd be
[32:47] able to take all the unknowns and the
[32:49] impossibles. We can put them in your
[32:51] hands, Lord, and you can [music] come
[32:53] and you can make something out of
[32:54] nothing. Lord, we love you. Father, I
[32:57] would just [music] ask that you would
[32:58] just see these requests, Lord, or Sister
[33:00] Lona, who had her wisdom teeth pulled.
[33:02] [music] Lord, I would just pray that you
[33:03] would just give her a speedy recovery

[33:07] those that have unspoken requests

[33:10] just pray that you would be with the man
[33:12] of God as he's [music] making his way,
[33:14] putting his thoughts together. Lord, I
[33:16] would just ask that you would just give
[33:17] him the words to speak and that you
[33:19] would just answer the questions, [music]
[33:21] Lord, and be in our hearts and minds. We
[33:23] just thank you. Be careful to give you
[33:24] the praise. Jesus' name. Amen.
[33:29] Amen. As the man of God comes, can we
[33:31] sing this? When I [music] look into
[33:34] [singing] your holyness,
[33:39] when I gaze into your loveliness,
[33:47] when all things that surround
[33:51] become shadows in the light of you.
[33:59] Yes, Lord.
[34:02] When I find the joy of [singing]
[34:05] reaching
[34:07] your heart,
[34:10] when my [singing] will becomes
[34:13] enthralled
[34:14] in your love,

[36:56] Amen. Amen. Amen. I worship you.
[37:03] you know, every chance we get to come to
[37:05] church and
[37:07] to praise him, to love him, I think I
[37:11] think the we should take advantage of
[37:14] those things.
[37:16] Amen. The psalmist
[37:19] says the the trees,
[37:22] they they wave their branches to the
[37:25] Lord and praise to him. He says, "The
[37:28] [music] hills they skip and and they
[37:32] praise the Lord."
[37:35] Well, if nature does that,
[37:38] how much more should it be for you and
[37:40] me?
[37:41] &gt;&gt; As sons of God, redeemed of the Lord,
[37:45] when we come [music] to church, have our
[37:46] hands up in the air, tears running down
[37:49] our face. [music]
[37:50] Sometimes we're clapping and rejoicing,
[37:55] but it's because he has made us glad. He
[37:58] has redeemed us.
[38:01] And I so [music] love him here tonight.
[38:04] I'm so thankful for him.
[38:07] Good to be in the house of the Lord
[38:09] tonight. [music] Good to see everyone
[38:10] and and uh enjoying this beautiful
[38:15] weather and and uh good sunny [music]
[38:19] week and in the 70s and and uh but we
[38:24] enjoyed it on Sunday too. [music] Amen.
[38:28] We appreciated all the hard work.
[38:30] [applause]
[38:35] I thought I thought everything was
[38:38] wonderful. I um I got on that slingshot
[38:41] and didn't really get to [music] get
[38:42] around uh very much, but uh it looked
[38:45] like everyone was having a good time. I
[38:47] know I was having a good time
[38:48] aggravating the youngans and uh uh
[38:53] watching people
[38:55] shoot targets or shoot themselves. Amen.
[39:01] And uh we had a wonderful time. And so
[39:05] we say God [music] bless everyone that
[39:06] that that made it happen. And and I tell
[39:08] you uh Tuesday was amazing with with the
[39:13] amount [music] of folks coming out and
[39:15] helping. And I say God bless you and and
[39:19] thank you so much. Um, I think we got it
[39:22] done [music] in a for the most part of
[39:24] it record time of uh 4 hours. [music]
[39:28] Uh, got and uh the boys and I were still
[39:31] taking things back different people
[39:33] until later on in the afternoon, but uh
[39:36] the the main part was was totally
[39:38] [music] done and uh so I say God richly
[39:43] bless every one of you. Hey, listen. And
[39:46] [music] I just
[39:48] [clears throat] I'm just here to tell
[39:49] you
[39:51] those the ladies of our church totally
[39:54] took down that tent.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; THEY [applause]
[40:02] [applause]
[40:05] they took down that tent. They they uh
[40:08] they done it all. And uh uh Caleb and
[40:12] [music] I took the main poll out, but uh
[40:15] I mean they
[40:18] were they were awesome. And so uh uh I
[40:22] say God bless you. You you you guys have
[40:25] you you you men. It's no wonder your
[40:26] families are so [music] blessed. Uh
[40:28] those ladies just jumped in and helped
[40:30] wherever they could and and [music] they
[40:32] could. They done a [laughter] good job.
[40:34] And so we say God bless them. just
[40:38] appreciate everyone [music] uh all of
[40:40] the work, young and old, man and woman.
[40:44] And um I think [music] one of these days
[40:47] we'll see. I got one
[40:50] uh Ronnie uh Justice um pulled me aside
[40:55] and
[40:56] and u
[40:59] and he he said, "Come here. I got to
[41:02] talk to you." and and um so he pulled me
[41:06] around the corner [music] and he said,
[41:08] "Listen,
[41:10] you are making a difference and [music]
[41:12] you are making a difference in the
[41:14] world." And I said, "Well, thank you."
[41:18] And [music] he said, "I'm serious. I'm
[41:20] serious. The you guys are" And he said,
[41:23] "I just had somebody I don't know who it
[41:26] was." does. He said, "I had [music] a
[41:27] man tell me, he said, Wendell Martin,
[41:31] that group over [music] there changed my
[41:34] life."
[41:36] Now, I don't know who the man is, and we
[41:38] might not ever know until the coming of
[41:41] the Lord, but what if there are people
[41:44] that we have [music] changed that maybe
[41:47] sometimes we get weary or we, you know,
[41:49] like Sunday, we put all that work out
[41:51] and didn't get very many [music] from
[41:53] the community cuz it was so cold. But
[41:56] what if we made an impact on someone's
[41:59] lives that did come?
[42:01] What if and I say we never want to tire
[42:05] in in in welloing. We'll always work for
[42:08] the Lord. Work while we've got strength.
[42:12] There'll come a time where
[42:14] we'll have to pass the torch to to
[42:16] somebody else and we won't be able to be
[42:18] out there doing the work. But I'm here
[42:21] to tell you, Sister Carol is saying,
[42:23] "Amen. and it'll be a long time. Amen.
[42:26] And I kept telling her, "You're you're
[42:28] you're in your mid70s. [music]
[42:31] You're going to have to She was grabbing
[42:33] that she she was grabbing that tent
[42:36] [music] and and stakes." And
[42:39] [laughter]
[42:41] [applause]
[42:47] so we say, "God, God bless all of you.
[42:53] I'd like uh for us to turn to Genesis
[42:55] [music] 21 and 1 or and um
[43:02] and um I want to say it's it's really
[43:07] been good. Uh, I've enjoyed, we've all
[43:11] enjoyed having Brother Theo here in the
[43:14] church with us and
[43:17] [applause]
[43:19] and he
[43:21] he's worked his way from the back of the
[43:23] church to the front of the church and
[43:25] he's dressing like a brother Brandham
[43:28] says, "When you come to church, wear the
[43:29] best you got." and uh and he comes just
[43:33] dressed up and coming to church and and
[43:36] eager to learn the Lord, learn the ways
[43:38] of the Lord. And that kind of an
[43:40] attitude the Lord will bless Brother
[43:42] Theo. And um that's exactly the way I
[43:45] done it when I was a young man. Uh
[43:48] wasn't going to set in the back. I was
[43:49] going to set up front. I was going to
[43:50] learn. I was going to give my all to the
[43:52] Lord. and and um I believe that every
[43:57] one of us uh can can look back at those
[44:00] times in our lives when we made up our
[44:02] mind. I'm going 100%.
[44:04] And I'm glad to see brother brother Theo
[44:08] doing that. And and um Amen. I I I
[44:12] personally think there should never be
[44:14] any kind of room up in the front that
[44:17] the people should want up where the fire
[44:19] is at. Amen. And we know that the
[44:22] prophet of God says the angel of the
[44:24] Lord is at the pull pit. He's with the
[44:27] speaker of the word. And so to see that
[44:30] with you young men and young ladies
[44:33] makes my heart very proud. Now let's
[44:37] look here in Genesis 21. And we're going
[44:40] to look here at the sixth verse. Not the
[44:43] first, the sixth. Sarah said, "God hath
[44:47] made me to laugh
[44:49] so that all that hear will laugh with
[44:52] me." And she said, "Who would have said
[44:56] unto Abram, Abraham,
[44:59] that Sarah should have given children
[45:02] suck? For I have borne him a son in his
[45:08] old age." And I my my thought tonight is
[45:12] just from the shadows to the positive.
[45:15] Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father,
[45:17] we just want to thank you today for your
[45:20] goodness. As we've heard the songs and
[45:23] we've sung the songs, as I sit there in
[45:25] my office here tonight,
[45:28] Lord, I I could feel the vibrancy of
[45:31] your spirit. The congregation was
[45:33] wanting to be here, Lord. And Father, I
[45:37] as I sat back there, I I asked you to
[45:41] minister to their hearts in a real
[45:44] special way today. Lord, I pray that
[45:47] your anointing would be here this
[45:48] evening. That you would, Lord, just use
[45:52] my lips, my thoughts, Lord. Lord, you
[45:56] just may it be you and you alone. Now,
[46:00] we look to you, Father, in Jesus' name.
[46:03] Can the church say amen?
[46:06] And amen. God bless you. You can be
[46:08] seated here tonight.
[46:12] Tonight, as we're living in the brink of
[46:14] the fulfillment of the Bible prophecy,
[46:18] things that we have that the church has
[46:20] looked for for 2,000 years.
[46:25] And we could even go all the way back to
[46:27] the fall and the promise that God gave
[46:29] back then that there would there would
[46:33] be a people, the woman's seed that would
[46:37] produce the word. Amen. and we would go
[46:41] back to Eden and um it were to where the
[46:46] sons of God would be at one with God,
[46:50] living with God, acting as God as as the
[46:54] children of promise.
[46:56] And as we are looking to the promise of
[47:00] giving birth to the word, sometimes it
[47:04] seems like it's a it's so far-fetched.
[47:08] It seems like it's so far beyond
[47:10] ourselves.
[47:12] And when we look at this, Amen. I I
[47:16] think it's a good consolation. We can
[47:18] gain great consolation by um talking or
[47:23] or looking at Abraham and Sarah. And I
[47:26] want to say here tonight, I forgot those
[47:28] specials were just wonderful tonight.
[47:32] Brother John [applause and cheering]
[47:32] special and and these girls. God
[47:37] [cheering] bless y'all. Good to see
[47:38] brother John tonight. I I u I he's it
[47:42] looks like he's going to be able to
[47:43] start making uh services a little more
[47:46] regular. And so we're sure glad for
[47:48] that. And um we sure love brother John
[47:51] and Sister April and their children. But
[47:54] as we as we uh look here, we we can see
[47:59] the struggles of Sarah and um and as as
[48:03] she was a type and a shadow. Amen. I I
[48:07] believe that God orchestrated the whole
[48:09] thing. And uh now you boys need to be
[48:13] paying attention up front here. But when
[48:15] we look here at the promises of God, we
[48:18] look at these things. We got to come
[48:21] with that heart of of humility
[48:25] and and we we can find ourselves in the
[48:29] scripture in the Old Testament and and
[48:33] as being the children of Abraham and
[48:35] knowing that the promise was given that
[48:38] thy seed shall possess. Amen. Now we
[48:42] understood that that Abraham went 25
[48:46] years looking for the natural seed. But
[48:50] we Amen. We understand that the Apostle
[48:53] Paul says really he was just a type of
[48:56] the spiritual seed. And that spiritual
[48:59] seed was Christ. And Christ coming as
[49:03] the as the perfect son of God as the
[49:06] redeemer. Amen. to redeem us, to bring
[49:09] us back to that condition that Christ
[49:13] was in.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ came to to redeem us back.
[49:19] And so we understand that the promises
[49:21] that we have today is the promise, amen,
[49:25] of that flesh being made word. And
[49:28] that's what we are all looking at today.
[49:31] We're this flesh being made word. Now as
[49:35] we look there at the condition that
[49:36] Sarah was in uh even when the son of man
[49:39] appeared and we understand that we're we
[49:42] have we have we have lived to the
[49:44] through the term this the church has
[49:46] served the term of the holy ghost but we
[49:49] are now living in the revealing of the
[49:52] son of man. It's the promise that God
[49:54] said would happen that Amen. right just
[49:58] before the coming of the Lord that there
[50:00] would be Amen as it was in the days of
[50:03] Sodom and Gomorrah before the
[50:05] destruction that the son of man would
[50:08] visit Sarah give Sarah ability and she
[50:12] would produce the promised child. We are
[50:15] living in that time right now. So when
[50:19] we see the revealing of the son of man,
[50:22] amen, there is the the words of promise
[50:26] have been spoken to into the womb of our
[50:29] heart and we've been believing and but
[50:32] sometimes
[50:33] even right there where the son of man
[50:36] came, Sarah was in the one of the
[50:39] battles of her life
[50:42] &gt;&gt; when when the son of man was revealing
[50:44] her heart when he was beginning to
[50:46] change when he changed their name. When
[50:49] he when he began to tell him that you're
[50:51] going to have the child, Sarah was
[50:53] laughing. Amen. And when the angel of
[50:55] the Lord talked to her and said, "Why
[50:57] are you laughing?" She said, "Oh, I'm
[50:59] not laughing." Amen. But then he turned
[51:02] right around after she laughed and he
[51:05] said, "Sarah shall have that son.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; I will visit her according to the time
[51:13] of life." So, so we we can see Sarah in
[51:18] this at this day the promise had been
[51:20] had been long time coming. She had now
[51:23] been waiting for 24 years and and the
[51:27] pressure had been overwhelming at times.
[51:29] Now Sarah does not does not really have
[51:33] a great resume Sarah for first of all
[51:36] even as a as a child she was never able
[51:39] to produce a baby. Amen. it and and u
[51:43] Amen. And she she was one that that
[51:46] struggled to believe. She had struggled
[51:49] to believe that God would call her, that
[51:52] God would use her. Amen. And so when it
[51:56] when it but yet in the in the crucial
[51:59] times, THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS
[52:02] HOLDING HER faith to the promise. Amen.
[52:06] And and I I I want to say that Amen.
[52:09] here tonight that Jesus we've got our
[52:12] our husband the Lord Jesus Christ has
[52:15] Amen. He is there amen uh uh
[52:18] consolidating or he is there uh uh uh uh
[52:21] making the promise sure to all of us as
[52:25] we as we look at ourselves here tonight
[52:28] because I'm going to tell you there's
[52:30] only one way that you're going to come
[52:32] amen into that promise and that's going
[52:35] to believe God and his word. There's
[52:37] absolutely no way that a rapture can
[52:39] come. There's absolutely no way of you
[52:41] overcoming this flesh. There's
[52:43] absolutely no way of going back to the
[52:45] sons of God unless you believe that
[52:47] word.
[52:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's beyond ourselves. There's
[52:50] nothing we can do to do it. And
[52:52] sometimes we sit in this pews and we
[52:54] listen to the preachers and we think
[52:56] there is nothing here that I I I don't
[53:00] know if I'LL EVER PRODUCE IT. But all we
[53:02] can do is say I believe THE WORD.
[53:07] THAT'S WHAT GOD'S LOOKING FOR. HE'S NOT
[53:09] WANTING ANY OF US TO try to make it
[53:11] happen. You can't make it happen. Can
[53:13] you say amen? She was she was JUST AS
[53:16] MUCH A PART OF THE promise as Abraham.
[53:19] AND YET SHE SAT THERE WITH NO ABILITY to
[53:22] conceive. AND AND SOMETIMES AS WE AS WE
[53:26] SIT HERE, it seems like, oh my, it's
[53:29] just so impossible to conceive. AND AND
[53:31] HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT SEEMS at times WHEN
[53:34] NOT ONE SHRED of evidence on her side
[53:37] AND THE EVIDENCE WAS TOTALLY ON the side
[53:41] of reason. Amen. But you see the with
[53:44] this anxiety with this with this uh uh
[53:49] uh wondering and questioning
[53:53] am I really the bride OR CAN I REALLY
[53:57] WILL I EVER BE ABLE? Yet we understand
[54:00] that she was IN GOD'S MIND FROM THE VERY
[54:04] BEGINNING.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; I think that's just amazing because in
[54:08] ourselves, we all look and we think it's
[54:11] it's got to, you know, sister Jones over
[54:14] here, she's she's perfect. She's she's
[54:17] going to make the rapture. Or you can
[54:18] look at brother so and so. Amen. But
[54:21] looking in the mirror, sometimes we look
[54:23] at ourselves and we Amen. We look at our
[54:28] inability.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; And with THAT COMES THE ANXIETY BECAUSE
[54:33] WE KNOW THAT PROPHECY IS BEING
[54:36] FULFILLED.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; We can see Russia, we can see China, we
[54:40] can see the US, WE CAN SEE ROME, WE CAN
[54:43] SEE ALL OF THIS HAPPENING and many of
[54:45] times we sit there in a in our sour
[54:48] moods.
[54:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. And just like Sarah, sour moods.
[54:53] Well, amen. I don't know. I DON'T KNOW.
[54:56] I DON'T KNOW. BUT GOD HAS ALREADY SAID,
[54:58] "I do because I'm looking at my book and
[55:01] that's your name and I know who you
[55:03] are."
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. And so, Amen.
[55:08] But that day must have been a a strange
[55:10] feeling as the prophet would have would
[55:12] would would put it. Amen. It was it was
[55:15] that that special. THERE WAS SOMETHING
[55:17] in the air. AMEN. BECAUSE THE PROMISE
[55:21] WAS FIXING to be made uh to become
[55:24] reality. History was in the making AND
[55:27] AND AND THE PROPHET SAID ABRAHAM SITTING
[55:30] in his chair just thinking about that
[55:32] son that was coming thinking about the
[55:34] promise. Amen. His body is old and dead
[55:38] and Sarah's just as dead as ever. Amen.
[55:41] But that strange feeling is in the air.
[55:44] Amen. AND AND AND AND THAT WAS THE TIME
[55:47] THAT God appeared to him and said, "I'm
[55:50] going to keep my promise." I I want to I
[55:53] just want to inject this here today.
[55:56] Amen. Satan is always looking to find a
[56:00] way in right when God is wanting to do
[56:02] something special in your life.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I think it's good to keep the
[56:07] right kind of attitudes even when the
[56:09] devil's fighting us with everything. I
[56:11] think it's the right it it's it's
[56:12] important that we have that right kind
[56:14] of attitude because we never know when
[56:17] he's going to appear. Can you say amen?
[56:19] SO, SO WE'VE GOT TO BE uh careful at
[56:22] which spirit uh he was entertaining.
[56:24] Now, now that morning uh Sarah was was
[56:28] was wondering how many fanatics is my
[56:31] husband going to entertain? Well, here
[56:35] she was ENTERTAINING A SPIRIT THAT WAS
[56:38] CONTRARY to the word and her husband was
[56:42] entertaining the presence of the Lord
[56:44] Jesus Christ.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to entertain the presence
[56:48] of the Lord Jesus Christ. That that's
[56:50] what I want to entertain. Amen. So
[56:52] remember, attitudes will open doors. Now
[56:56] again, SARAH, SO AS WE can see, she was
[56:59] not always that that that woman of great
[57:02] faith. Amen. and she looked at things
[57:04] rationally. In fact, IT HAD BEEN QUITE A
[57:07] JOURNEY. She had a hard time uh
[57:10] accepting that God would choose her. And
[57:13] she had always been barren. And her
[57:15] confession is the Lord had shut up my
[57:18] womb. And amen, IT'S GOT TO COME THROUGH
[57:20] SOMEBODY ELSE. IN FACT, SHE gave Abraham
[57:24] her maid. She gave Abraham Hagar. Amen.
[57:28] And says the promised son will come
[57:31] through her.
[57:32] And yet when ISHMAEL WAS BORN, SARAH GOT
[57:35] UPSET.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; SARAH, HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Abraham just
[57:39] wasn't GOING TO WIN EITHER WAY. AMEN.
[57:41] And so, uh, UH, UH, SHE'S UPSET. SHE
[57:45] SAID, "AMEN." WELL, you know, you love
[57:47] her more than me. And, and Abraham is
[57:50] saying, "Listen, I amen, you know, so
[57:55] her her bonds made was able to TO
[57:58] PRODUCE THE SON." And and the BIBLE SAYS
[58:01] THAT SARAH WAS WAS VERY HARSH TO THE
[58:03] WOMAN SO MUCH that that uh she fled from
[58:07] Sarah. And Abraham was was was was a
[58:11] little bit weary. I I don't KNOW WHAT TO
[58:14] DO. I LOVE ISHMAEL AND I AND I WANT
[58:16] ISHMAEL. I I LET LET THE PROMISE COME
[58:19] THROUGH ISHMAEL, LORD. And and God says,
[58:22] "Amen. Send the bondwoman and her son
[58:26] away." Amen. for the THE PROMISE WILL
[58:30] COME through Sarah and she shall have a
[58:34] son.
[58:35] &gt;&gt; And uh Amen. Oh my, WHAT A WHAT A TIME
[58:39] it was. BUT YOU SEE, I'M GLAD FOR THESE
[58:42] PROTOTYPES BECAUSE IT'S IN THESE
[58:44] PROTOTYPES here that that we and and
[58:47] Amen. You know, we now back then we'd
[58:49] say shadows or types, but these days
[58:52] here they they make the little
[58:54] prototypes or the 3D things to Amen.
[58:57] give you a a a view of what the real
[58:59] thing was going to LOOK LIKE. AND SO GOD
[59:01] WAS WAS WAS PUTTING IT OUT THERE RAW SO
[59:04] THAT EVERY ONE OF US IN THE BRIDE could
[59:07] understand and could see. Amen. JUST AS
[59:10] GOD WAS FAITHFUL WITH SARAH, he's going
[59:14] to be faithful with you. As he was
[59:17] faithful WITH HIM. I THAT JUST MAKES me
[59:20] feel so good. You don't know how often I
[59:22] I I I I'm sitting there in in my in my
[59:25] study of study and and the devil has
[59:28] said, you know, you're one of the most
[59:29] worthless preachers around. Amen. You
[59:31] think, well, now is that is does THAT
[59:33] REALLY HAPPEN? OH, HE'LL TELL ME ALL
[59:35] KINDS OF STUFF. YOU'RE not the ONLY ONE
[59:38] THAT THE DEVIL TELLS THAT TO.
[59:40] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THAT EVEN
[59:42] EVEN THE DEVIL WOULD TELL HIM you don't
[59:44] have a friend in the world. No one loves
[59:46] you. Amen. The only reason they put up
[59:48] with you is because of your gift. Amen.
[59:51] AND AND AND THE DEVIL WOULD WILL HE'LL
[59:53] DO ANYTHING HE CAN. BUT I'm here to tell
[59:55] you there is nothing the devil can do to
[59:59] stop the promise. Can I hear an amen?
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Nothing Satan CAN DO TO STOP [screaming]
[1:00:06] THAT PROMISE.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; SO I SAY TODAY, it's time for us to get
[1:00:10] a RIGHT ATTITUDE. GET AN ATTITUDE THAT
[1:00:13] SAYS, "YOU KNOW WHAT? I AM THE BRIDE OF
[1:00:15] JESUS CHRIST. DON'T care what it looks
[1:00:18] like. Don't care what I feel. I DON'T
[1:00:19] CARE ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING about me.
[1:00:22] THERE'S SOMETHING WITHIN ME THAT SAYS
[1:00:25] THAT [screaming] I AM PART OF THAT
[1:00:26] PROMISE."
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU say amen? Amen. It It's
[1:00:31] wonderful. You see, Sarah was just as
[1:00:34] much a part of that promise as anything.
[1:00:36] Now,
[1:00:38] now, Brother Brandham would would would
[1:00:40] say Abraham knew that the time of the
[1:00:43] promise was coming close. It had to be.
[1:00:46] He was a hundred years old. He was
[1:00:48] expecting it any time. He watched every
[1:00:50] minute. And when he run in, told Sarah,
[1:00:53] "This, I believe, is our day of
[1:00:54] visitation." And she kind of looked at
[1:00:56] him with those big eyes and thought,
[1:00:58] "Well, Abraham, you've said that a long
[1:01:00] time, but but you know, THERE WILL COME
[1:01:03] A TIME when it will be so if God has
[1:01:06] said so."
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; And then when THE ANGEL TOOK HIS chair
[1:01:10] and he leaned back and he said,"Abraham,
[1:01:13] seeing you have got favor with God and
[1:01:15] you're an heir of the world, you're
[1:01:17] going to be the father of many nations
[1:01:18] and you've believed since you were 75 20
[1:01:22] joint 75 years old. your 25 years and
[1:01:25] other otherwise you've waited for this
[1:01:27] promised child Basera and now I'm not
[1:01:31] going to keep this from you. What I'm
[1:01:33] going to do I'm going to visit you
[1:01:36] according to the time of life. I'm going
[1:01:39] to visit you according to the time of
[1:01:41] life. Now they didn't have the child
[1:01:43] immediately. Amen. It was going to be
[1:01:45] months later before the child was going
[1:01:47] to come. BUT THERE THE VISITATION CAME.
[1:01:51] the visitation. Amen. Was the words from
[1:01:55] Elohim saying, "Amen. You're going to
[1:02:00] produce." There was something about
[1:02:02] those words that began to change the the
[1:02:06] bodies of Sarah and Abraham.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; AND I I I SAY THAT THE AUTHOR OF OUR
[1:02:12] STORY, I believe he's fully aware of our
[1:02:15] inabilities. And again, I keep going
[1:02:17] back to it, but I just want to say it
[1:02:18] again. Amen. He [laughter] I THE AUTHOR
[1:02:22] OF YOUR story says I knew you before and
[1:02:27] I know you now.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; I CREATED the story. So I am intimately
[1:02:34] involved in every part of you because I
[1:02:37] am the author of the story.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Do you know that God knows your
[1:02:44] uprisings and your downsittings? God
[1:02:46] knows all of that. God is not just the
[1:02:48] Bible says the footsteps of a good man
[1:02:51] are ordered of the Lord.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Well, glory to God.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I I I looked there at
[1:02:59] in there at the uh uh I believe it was
[1:03:03] the believers there in Samra where where
[1:03:05] God had said there in Revelations 2:9,
[1:03:07] "I know thy works and tribulation and
[1:03:11] poverty, but thou art rich." IN OTHER
[1:03:14] WORDS, I KNOW I I I'm I'm very much
[1:03:18] aware of that you're going through the
[1:03:19] persecution you're going through.
[1:03:21] Brother Brandon would put it this way.
[1:03:23] He says, "NOW THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY
[1:03:24] SAYS, I KNOW THERE HE IS WALKING in the
[1:03:27] midst of his people. There he is, the
[1:03:28] chief shepherd of the flock, BUT DOES HE
[1:03:30] HOLD BACK THE PERSECUTION? DOES HE STEM
[1:03:32] the tribulation?" NO, HE DOES NOT. HE
[1:03:35] SIMPLY SAYS, "I KNOW YOUR TRIBULATION. I
[1:03:38] I am not AT ALL UNMINDFUL
[1:03:42] OF YOUR SUFFERINGS." WELL, someone shout
[1:03:44] hallelujah.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; GOD KNOWS WHERE YOU'RE AT. GOD KNEW
[1:03:48] WHERE SARAH WAS AT. GOD KNEW THE WHOLE
[1:03:51] PLAN. GOD KNEW IT ALL AT THE BEGINNING.
[1:03:54] And we don't realize it until we come
[1:03:57] down to our age that there had to be a
[1:03:59] Hagar
[1:04:01] and there had to be a Sarah and there
[1:04:04] had to be a Mary. It had to be IN ORDER
[1:04:09] FOR US TO SEE WHERE WE ARE.
[1:04:12] YEAH.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WELL, praise the name of the
[1:04:15] Lord. He says, does he stem the
[1:04:17] tribulation? No, he does not. He simply
[1:04:19] says, I know your tribulation. I am not
[1:04:22] at all unmindful of your sufferings.
[1:04:25] What a stumbling block that is to so
[1:04:27] many people like Israel. They wonder if
[1:04:29] God really loves them. How can God be
[1:04:31] just and loving if if he stands by and
[1:04:34] watches his people suffer? That is what
[1:04:36] they asked in Malachi 1:1. the burden of
[1:04:38] the Lord uh to to Israel by Malachi. I
[1:04:42] have loved you, saith the Lord. Yet you
[1:04:45] say, WHEREIN HAST THOU LOVED ME? WAS NOT
[1:04:48] ESAU JACOB'S BROTHER? SAYAETH THE LORD,
[1:04:50] YET I LOVE JACOB AND I HATED Esau and
[1:04:54] laid his mountains and his heritage ways
[1:04:57] FOR THE DRAGONS OF THE WILDERNESS. SO
[1:04:58] GOD IS TRYING, GOD WAS SIMPLY SAYING,
[1:05:01] LISTEN, I AM AWARE,
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:05:05] &gt;&gt; But I've loved Jacob. That didn't stop a
[1:05:07] lot of the situations he went through,
[1:05:09] but I was with Jacob. If there's ever
[1:05:12] anything that can should give you a give
[1:05:15] you a an anchor is that God knows where
[1:05:20] you are and there is nothing in your
[1:05:24] trial. Well, praise the name of the Lord
[1:05:26] that that can that can take away that
[1:05:28] love. You know, he he he would also say
[1:05:31] he says he says they couldn't figure out
[1:05:33] God's love. They thought love meant no
[1:05:35] suffering. They thought love meant a
[1:05:37] baby with parental care. But God said
[1:05:40] that his love was elective love. The
[1:05:42] proof of his LOVE IS ELECTION. THAT NO
[1:05:44] MATTER what happened, his love WAS
[1:05:46] PROVEN TRULY BY THE fact that they were
[1:05:49] chosen under salvation. Because God has
[1:05:51] chosen you to salvation through the
[1:05:53] sanctification of the spirit and the
[1:05:54] belief of truth. He may commit you to
[1:05:56] death as he did Paul. He may commit you
[1:05:58] to suffering as he did Job. That is his
[1:05:59] prerogative. That is his sovereign. He
[1:06:01] he that it IT'S BUT IT'S ALL WITH A
[1:06:04] PURPOSE. HE IF HE DID NOT HAVE A PURPOSE
[1:06:07] THEN HE WOULD BE THE AUTHOR of
[1:06:08] frustration and not of peace. His
[1:06:10] purpose is that after we have suffered a
[1:06:12] while he would make he uh we would be
[1:06:16] made perfect and be established
[1:06:18] strengthened and settled.
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Can I hear a great big amen?
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; WHAT I'M SAYING IS YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
[1:06:24] THE TRIAL RIGHT NOW, BUT WHEN YOU COME
[1:06:25] OUT YOU'RE GOING TO BE STRONGER.
[1:06:27] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE VALLEY.
[1:06:30] AMEN. MAYBE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH A VALLEY
[1:06:32] FOR A WHOLE YEAR, TWO YEARS. I DON'T
[1:06:34] KNOW. MAYBE YOU'VE GONE THROUGH A VALLEY
[1:06:36] a long time. But I'm here to tell you,
[1:06:38] the great shepherd has been right there
[1:06:40] by your side.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I've not been too
[1:06:43] strong. I I've fallen here and I've
[1:06:45] fallen there." I want to tell you, if it
[1:06:47] had not been for your name on that book
[1:06:49] and God and if you DIDN'T HAVE JESUS
[1:06:51] CHRIST INTERCEDING FOR YOU, THERE'D be
[1:06:53] none of us here.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; BUT THE FACT THAT YOU ARE STILL HERE,
[1:06:56] AMEN. I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR TRIALS. I
[1:06:58] DON'T CARE HOW MANY FAILURES YOU'VE GOT,
[1:07:00] HOW MUCH YOU HAVE, YOU HAVE BLOWN IT
[1:07:02] HERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE. AMEN. THE
[1:07:05] GRACE OF GOD HAS BEEN THERE IN YOUR
[1:07:08] LIFE.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; YOU [screaming] ARE HIS BRIDE.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; OH, CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. It's not your
[1:07:18] strength. It's not YOUR STRENGTH. AMEN.
[1:07:20] JOB SAID THERE IN IN IN IN Job 23 and6
[1:07:25] at the last of the verse there, if you'd
[1:07:26] put that up there, Sister Keys, I can't
[1:07:28] remember it, but he but but HE SAYS,
[1:07:29] "BUT HE WOULD PUT STRENGTH in me." He
[1:07:35] would Pete put strength in me. YOU SEE,
[1:07:38] GOD [screaming] IS IS IS THERE TO
[1:07:42] strengthen because he knows that you're
[1:07:44] the carrier of the promise.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now,
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; now and before we move on any further,
[1:07:50] Isaiah 30:18, it says, "And therefore
[1:07:53] will the Lord wait that he may be
[1:07:56] gracious unto you. Therefore will he be
[1:08:00] exalted and that he may have mercy upon
[1:08:04] you. For the Lord is a God of judgment.
[1:08:07] Blessed are they or all they that wait
[1:08:12] for him." Okay.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; There's something about the journey that
[1:08:16] God wants.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; There's something about the journey.
[1:08:19] Now, I know this a Wednesday night and I
[1:08:20] don't want to keep you too long, but
[1:08:22] there's something about the journey that
[1:08:24] God wants. YES, SIR.
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SAID, AMEN.
[1:08:29] I to the church. Amen. When we look a
[1:08:32] little on the weak side, we go through
[1:08:35] the ages and we look that WE'VE SEEN THE
[1:08:37] HAGARS and her sons and we've seen the
[1:08:40] denominational systems. AMEN. AND HOW
[1:08:43] THEY'VE given birth and have no problems
[1:08:45] and you know they've BEEN ABLE TO TAKE
[1:08:48] ON CREEDS AND DOGMAS AND AMEN. BUT YET
[1:08:52] GOD SAID ISHMAEL
[1:08:56] WILL not be heir with Isaac. Right?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; So when it looks like as far as the two
[1:09:02] women Ishmael could produce or Hagar
[1:09:05] could produce, SARAH COULD NOT PRODUCE,
[1:09:07] THAT GIVES HER A COMPLEX BECAUSE SHE'S
[1:09:10] LOOKING AT AT AT THE BEAUTIFUL CHILD
[1:09:12] [screaming] AND HAGAR IS LAUGHING AT
[1:09:14] SARAH.
[1:09:16] AND SARAH IS THE ONE WHO'S BEEN GIVEN
[1:09:19] THE PROMISE,
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Does that does that is that really
[1:09:23] coming close here? Does that really do
[1:09:26] do you see yourself in the prototype? Do
[1:09:29] you see yourself in the shadows? Can you
[1:09:31] say amen? So So a Abraham, even Abraham,
[1:09:36] the Bible says, started looking at
[1:09:37] Sarah. Abraham, she she she'll, you
[1:09:40] know, she'll never catch it. [laughter]
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; She is as spiritless as they come. Amen.
[1:09:47] Sarah just oh all the time accusing me
[1:09:50] of entertaining
[1:09:52] strangers and all this kind of stuff
[1:09:55] when I'm talking to God and he and and
[1:09:57] and Abraham says oh that Ishmael there
[1:10:00] in Genesis 17 and 18 Abraham said unto
[1:10:02] God oh that Ishmael might live in thy
[1:10:04] sight [laughter]
[1:10:06] you know oh we could get this thing over
[1:10:08] with if you just change your mind about
[1:10:10] Sarah and Isaac and let's just have
[1:10:12] Ishmael but you see that wasn't the
[1:10:14] promise
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; that wasn't the promise
[1:10:16] GOD WAS VERY EMPHATIC. IF YOU WERE TO GO
[1:10:18] TO Genesis 17 and 15, they mean it's
[1:10:21] talking about Sarah uh um or or uh uh
[1:10:25] hallelujah. I don't know how I've got
[1:10:26] that, but uh 17- 16, I will bless her
[1:10:30] and give thee a son also of her. Yay, I
[1:10:34] will bless her. She shall be a mother of
[1:10:37] nations, and the kings of the people
[1:10:39] shall be of her. And the and and and
[1:10:41] then the next verse is Abraham fell on
[1:10:43] his face and laughed and said in his
[1:10:45] heart shall a child be born unto him
[1:10:47] that is 100 years old and shall Sarah
[1:10:49] that is 90 that bear a child get bear.
[1:10:52] You see what I'm saying? You're going
[1:10:53] down to the n 19th verse and it says and
[1:10:55] God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee
[1:11:00] a son indeed and thou shalt call his
[1:11:03] name Isaac.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHEN WHEN THE APOSTLE PAUL'S
[1:11:09] TALKING ABOUT it there in the in in uh
[1:11:11] uh the book of Hebrews 6:13, it says,
[1:11:13] "FOR WHEN GOD MADE THE PROMISE TO
[1:11:15] ABRAHAM, BECAUSE HE COULD SWEAR BY NO
[1:11:18] GREATER, HE SWORE BY HIMSELF, SAYING,
[1:11:22] surely blessing I will bless thee, AND
[1:11:24] MULTIPLYING I WILL multiply
[1:11:27] thee." So after he patiently endured, he
[1:11:30] obtained THE PROMISE, AND SO WILL THE
[1:11:33] BRIDE.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. You might
[1:11:39] be fighting your afflictions right now,
[1:11:41] but the promise is coming. Satan, you
[1:11:43] might as well en enjoy your time because
[1:11:46] Amen. The time as I've been given a
[1:11:49] promise, a promise HAS BEEN GIVEN ME
[1:11:52] THAT I'm going to give birth to that
[1:11:54] word.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHAT WE ARE. THIS IS WHAT WE'RE
[1:11:57] DOING TODAY. AND IF WE going to believe
[1:11:59] that WORD REGARDLESS, THAT'S WHAT YOU
[1:12:02] HAVE. And I want to say here today,
[1:12:05] that's what we have believed. Yes, sir.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; We believe the son of man ministry in
[1:12:09] this day and we are producing the word
[1:12:13] of God.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Less of us and more of him. Can you say
[1:12:17] amen?
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. We preached here a couple weeks
[1:12:19] ago that despise not the the day of
[1:12:22] small things. Amen. You see this the
[1:12:25] days of preparation. Sarah, get your
[1:12:27] eyes off of you and and it's it's not
[1:12:30] your abilities. It's not your gifts.
[1:12:32] Well, glory to God. Amen. God also says
[1:12:35] there in the book of Genesis the 18th
[1:12:37] chapter if we went to that next chapter
[1:12:39] the 18th when when God is having this
[1:12:42] discourse with Sarah he he he says there
[1:12:45] in in the Amen uh uh the 13th verse
[1:12:48] there and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:12:50] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:12:53] sure of assurityity bear a child which
[1:12:56] I'm old AND THEN GOD SAYS IS anything
[1:13:00] too hard for the Lord
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; at the time appointed, I WILL, somebody
[1:13:08] say, I will.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; I will,
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; return unto thee according to the time
[1:13:12] of life, and Sarah shall have a son.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; WELL, GLORY TO GOD.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; WHAT THAT DOES, IT'S GRACE. IT TAKES IT
[1:13:23] ALL AWAY FROM YOU. And God's looking for
[1:13:25] a rest.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Now, God's expecting that now. God's
[1:13:29] expecting a faith IN THIS HOUR TO TO
[1:13:32] BELIEVE. NOW, I KNOW THE MIND BATTLES
[1:13:34] ARE THERE, BUT WE'VE GOT TO BRING THOSE
[1:13:36] ATTITUDES IN LINE WITH THE SON OF MAN
[1:13:38] and believe that that's what's
[1:13:41] important. Can you say amen?
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. The the the the prophet would say,
[1:13:45] "Amen." That in the midst of it all,
[1:13:47] through every age, every prophet is
[1:13:49] being would be, there's going to BE A
[1:13:51] CERTAIN AMOUNT OF PEOPLE that's
[1:13:52] predestinated TO HEAR THAT MESSAGE, AND
[1:13:56] THEY will follow it. Well, glory to God.
[1:14:01] Hallelujah. Now you see
[1:14:05] if she had not been a part of Abraham,
[1:14:08] she would have totally
[1:14:11] uh failed. Now I'm want to get us to a
[1:14:14] certain point here for a moment.
[1:14:17] The the the prophet would say, "Amen."
[1:14:19] He said, "My my Lord being old and me
[1:14:21] old and me having pleasure with him
[1:14:23] again." And and and brother Brandham
[1:14:25] intimates or imitates Sarah's silent
[1:14:28] laugh. And the angel showed Abraham who
[1:14:30] he was and that he was the word. And he
[1:14:33] said, "Why did Sarah laugh?" So he
[1:14:35] called her for it. And she said, "I
[1:14:37] never." He said, "But you did." What?
[1:14:40] That's grace right there. God would have
[1:14:42] slew her right there. But he couldn't.
[1:14:45] Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; He couldn't see our stupidity. He'd kill
[1:14:50] every one of us. But he can't. TO KILL
[1:14:53] SARAH, he had to take Abraham. SARAH WAS
[1:14:56] PART OF ABRAHAM.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; There was on there was one in union.
[1:15:00] They were one in union. And to take the
[1:15:02] church and destroy it, he can't do it
[1:15:04] because it's part of himself. Christ
[1:15:07] part of himself. The word being made
[1:15:10] flesh.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, amazing how sweet the sound. Amazing
[1:15:15] grace. How sweet the sound. Couldn't do
[1:15:16] it. You get it? He couldn't kill her. He
[1:15:18] couldn't take her life because she was
[1:15:19] part of Abraham. SHE WAS FLESH OF HIS
[1:15:21] FLESH, BONE OF HIS BONE IN OUR MISTAKES.
[1:15:24] AMEN. DON'T SAY, "WELL, I MADE A
[1:15:26] FAILURE." THAT DON'T AMEN. DON'T MAKE
[1:15:28] THEM. Abraham made failures, TOO. BUT HE
[1:15:32] COULDN'T TAKE THE CHURCH. He can't KILL
[1:15:35] THE ELECT. HE CAN'T TAKE YOUR LIFE
[1:15:38] BECAUSE YOU are part of himself. YOU ARE
[1:15:43] THE WORD.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THE WORD. YOU'RE THAT
[1:15:47] PREDESTINATED WORD FOR THE HOUR,
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; WOW.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. You are the
[1:15:55] word for the hour. Then why why why
[1:16:02] we ask the questions why why does he
[1:16:05] allow why do I go through he's wanting a
[1:16:09] faith steadfast
[1:16:12] in his promise.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; Now God made that promise with Abraham.
[1:16:18] He had told Abraham, I want you to take
[1:16:20] a heer. I want you to take a a she goat.
[1:16:23] I want you to take a ram all of three
[1:16:24] years old. I want you to divide them.
[1:16:26] Amen. And he and he and he set them out
[1:16:28] there. Then the pillar of fire come in
[1:16:30] there and went between the pieces. The
[1:16:32] prophet of God says that was a type when
[1:16:35] Jesus God took Jesus. Amen. Separated
[1:16:39] him, took his body to heaven and left
[1:16:43] his spirit with us. And when he returns,
[1:16:46] we've got his spirit. So when he
[1:16:49] returns, IT'S GOING TO BE THE SAME. It's
[1:16:52] going to be like the two PIECES OF
[1:16:54] PAPER. WELL, CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:16:56] HALLELUJAH. SO, GOD'S LIKE THIS. AND THE
[1:16:58] WAY THEY USED TO AMEN. The the the the
[1:17:01] way the old Chinese uh uh laundry used
[1:17:03] to go is they would Amen. You would they
[1:17:05] didn't know how to write when they first
[1:17:06] come to the United States. And so, uh
[1:17:08] you would take your your laundry to
[1:17:10] them. And so what they would do is take
[1:17:12] a little piece of paper and and they
[1:17:14] would they would cut it a certain way
[1:17:15] like this and and maybe like this and
[1:17:18] and like this and then and and and and
[1:17:21] and however it it might be. And and um
[1:17:25] and so you were given a piece [snorts]
[1:17:28] and they kept a peace. And so when you
[1:17:31] CAME TO ASK FOR YOUR LAUNDRY, THEY
[1:17:34] DIDN'T KNOW
[1:17:36] HOW TO TALK to you. They they didn't
[1:17:38] know the language. But what they could
[1:17:40] do, they would take your piece and they
[1:17:43] would go find their piece. And then when
[1:17:45] it fit together, they knew that you that
[1:17:49] the product belonged to you. AND WHEN
[1:17:52] GOD COMES, [screaming]
[1:17:53] HE'S GOING TO COME, JESUS COMES, HE'S
[1:17:56] GOING TO LOOK FOR HIS SPIRIT in your
[1:17:59] body. And they're going to dovetail
[1:18:01] right together like that. [applause]
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; It's the promise. IT'S THE PROMISE. CAN
[1:18:07] YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. SO GOD TOOK JESUS
[1:18:12] AND HE SET BACK HIS SPIRIT. And when the
[1:18:14] two pieces come back together, well,
[1:18:17] glory to God, brother Benham, he he
[1:18:19] paints it beautifully. HE SAYS, "THEN
[1:18:20] WHAT DID GOD DO AT CALVARY? HE TOOK
[1:18:22] CHRIST JESUS, HIS SON, PUT HIM ON THE
[1:18:24] CROSS, TORE HIM INTO HE RENT THE SOUL
[1:18:27] FROM THAT BODY, TOOK THE BODY UP INTO
[1:18:29] HEAVEN, AND SENT BACK THE HOLY Spirit to
[1:18:32] the church." And on that day, the same
[1:18:35] spirit that WAS UPON JESUS CHRIST HAS TO
[1:18:38] BE IN THE CHURCH TO DOVETAIL THE TWO
[1:18:41] BACK TOGETHER. AMEN. IT'S GOT TO BE. HE
[1:18:44] SAYS, HE SAYS, UH, ON THAT DAY, GOD
[1:18:47] SWORE BY HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD RAISE
[1:18:49] THAT CHURCH UP, A GLORIOUS CHURCH. HOW
[1:18:52] CAN IT FALL? THAT'S GOD'S EVERLASTING,
[1:18:56] ETERNAL COVENANT. HE SWORE BY HIMSELF.
[1:18:58] HE'LL KEEP HIS PROMISE. AND then he
[1:19:01] says, "Oh, I hope you see it."
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He puts his spirit.
[1:19:11] Then how COULD HE KILL YOU? HOW COULD
[1:19:12] YOU go to hell when you have the very
[1:19:14] spirit of CHRIST IN YOU?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; HOW COULD YOU MISS THE RAPTURE WHEN THE
[1:19:18] VERY presence of God is living on the
[1:19:20] inside of you?
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Winnow, that's the
[1:19:23] problem." Amen. No one, you know, uh uh
[1:19:26] uh uh you know, you're you're you're you
[1:19:29] lean too far to grace and you don't
[1:19:31] preach. I mean, we got to have more
[1:19:33] legalism. And Amen. Legalism is GOING TO
[1:19:36] BREED NOTHING BUT CONDEMNATION.
[1:19:39] GRACE LEADS TO CONVICTION. THE
[1:19:42] CONVICTING POWER OF GOD COMES TO US AND
[1:19:46] SAYS, "LISTEN, YOU ARE SARAH. START
[1:19:49] BELIEVING MY WORD."
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; OKAY.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; AMEN. will never rise above a
[1:19:55] browbeating. We'll never RISE ABOVE IT
[1:19:57] ALL. AMEN. BUT YOU WILL RISE ABOVE IT
[1:20:00] WHEN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOUR name's in
[1:20:02] that book OF LIFE.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; YOU WILL RISE ABOVE IT WHEN YOU KNOW
[1:20:06] THAT THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST ON THE INSIDE
[1:20:08] OF YOU IS A HOLY SPIRIT. AND IT WILL NOT
[1:20:11] UH UH UH uh live in an unclean vessel.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; If you love him. Well, can you say amen?
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; So
[1:20:19] that day came when Sarah had Amen. When
[1:20:23] God would appear and change their names,
[1:20:27] God would appear and God would change
[1:20:29] the names. Abram, which means
[1:20:32] fatherless,
[1:20:33] I'm going to give you a part of my name.
[1:20:36] I'm going to call you Abraham.
[1:20:40] I'm going to call you. And brother
[1:20:42] Brandon would say, see, he took a part
[1:20:44] of his name and put it in Abraham's or
[1:20:48] Abram's name, Elohim. And now he gave a
[1:20:52] part of his name to Abraham, puts them
[1:20:55] together and says, "Now every time you
[1:20:57] speak that name, I want you to know that
[1:21:00] deity is associated with it.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; I've given you my words of promise." Oh,
[1:21:05] can you say amen?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said he associated his name
[1:21:10] with God's name. God is Elohim. How how
[1:21:13] many knows that the great Jehovah
[1:21:16] Elohim, the allsufficient one, the
[1:21:19] self-existing one, Elohim, how what what
[1:21:22] did he do? He gave the HM off of his
[1:21:24] name, placed it on Abraham's name and
[1:21:27] made and he because he become Abraham.
[1:21:30] God is the father of all. Abraham is the
[1:21:32] father of nations. Glory Elohim the
[1:21:35] father of all. Abraham the father of
[1:21:37] nations placing positionally. Now then
[1:21:39] in this same chapter, he gives him a
[1:21:41] sign. gives the Pentecostal church a
[1:21:43] sign of the end. After that, Abraham had
[1:21:46] his name changed a few days. Amen. He
[1:21:49] was placed then as Elohim associated
[1:21:53] with God. Oh, you know it. You know,
[1:21:56] isn't it good to be a holy ruler? Placed
[1:21:59] him, associated him with God. Give him
[1:22:01] part of his name. What kind of a name
[1:22:03] does his church have? His name. THAT'S
[1:22:06] RIGHT. I COME IN MY FATHER'S name and
[1:22:09] you receive me not. Jesus said Jesus
[1:22:12] name I'm another if another will come in
[1:22:15] their name his name organization you'll
[1:22:17] receive it but he associated Abraham
[1:22:20] with his name and his church has his
[1:22:23] name
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; can you say amen
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; what is this what is this to do as we
[1:22:30] begin to to to stop here and now we
[1:22:34] understand that the that the Bible says
[1:22:37] that there's going to be a church with
[1:22:38] the names of blasphemy
[1:22:41] going to have all kinds of blasphemous
[1:22:42] names, but that's not who you are. Names
[1:22:45] of blasphemy, Pentecost,
[1:22:48] Amen. Methodist, and you know, what have
[1:22:50] you. The these are names of blasphemy.
[1:22:53] Amen. But see, the bride has not been
[1:22:56] given the names of blasphemy. They've
[1:22:57] been given the name of God.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; And we're looking to this promise
[1:23:03] because your name originated out of the
[1:23:06] book of life. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; Now, I want us to look I want us to
[1:23:12] think
[1:23:14] as as I begin as I think about the three
[1:23:16] women. And I dare say to you that there
[1:23:20] really isn't a true type in these three
[1:23:24] women for the church. Brother Brandham
[1:23:26] would or for the bride, brother Brandham
[1:23:29] would talk about the three women. Amen.
[1:23:32] in in connection with with the seed of
[1:23:34] Abraham, there was there was uh Sarah
[1:23:38] who was given the promise and um now now
[1:23:41] Sarah was a free woman
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; and through sex uh she bore a natural
[1:23:48] nation. Then there was Hagar the
[1:23:51] bondswoman
[1:23:53] he meant sex adultery.
[1:23:56] She produced a wild nation.
[1:23:59] Then the prophet said that there would
[1:24:01] come a marry with no sex at all. She was
[1:24:05] virgin and she birthed the word.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Okay,
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; she produced it,
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; BUT AS BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD GO ON,
[1:24:12] AMEN, I find that I can't find myself
[1:24:16] with any of those three women.
[1:24:19] You say, now how is this going to be?
[1:24:22] And and and
[1:24:25] you say, h how can you not see yourself
[1:24:27] in Mary's typology? She was a virgin and
[1:24:31] and and she produced Jesus, but Mary was
[1:24:34] not God's bride.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Mary was not God's bride. Amen. She was
[1:24:40] a carrier of life. And brother Brandham
[1:24:43] would would would would say, amen, that
[1:24:46] the church will come through
[1:24:47] justification through Luther,
[1:24:49] sanctification through Wesley, baptism
[1:24:51] of the Holy Ghost, and the Pentecostals,
[1:24:53] and go right on into the perfection of
[1:24:54] the son of man when husband and wife
[1:24:56] will be the self-same persons. God will
[1:25:00] be so manifested into his bride, his
[1:25:02] church, till they be that they will both
[1:25:05] be the same. They are one. Can you say
[1:25:10] amen?
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now he we would we would go down
[1:25:14] and and and brother brother Brandham
[1:25:16] would talk about how that Amen. You talk
[1:25:19] about the three women and and and he
[1:25:21] would say Mary not through sex but
[1:25:24] through faith something exactly like it.
[1:25:27] Mary was not the seed. Mary was a
[1:25:32] carrier of the seed. HE WAS THE GENUINE
[1:25:35] FAITH seed because the word of God is by
[1:25:37] faith that he gave to Abraham. Only
[1:25:40] faith can produce what God said he would
[1:25:42] do. Faith in his word. Notice how more
[1:25:46] uh how more like the real thing Mary
[1:25:48] was, but she was the uh but like THE
[1:25:52] SHUCK. THE SHUCK HOLDS HUGS the seed in
[1:25:55] itself and protects it and nurture
[1:25:58] nurtures it until it's standing alone
[1:26:00] and mature. So has this third church age
[1:26:04] of Pentecost matured holding this grain
[1:26:09] until it's time to open THE SHOCK.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; SO WE'RE NOT EVEN WE CAN'T EVEN FIND our
[1:26:16] type in Mary.
[1:26:18] OUR TYPE IS THE WORD.
[1:26:22] &gt;&gt; Now again he would go he would go back
[1:26:25] through it. Wesley was type of Sarah.
[1:26:28] The Philadelphiaian age of love brought
[1:26:31] forth the tassel in Wesley's age. There
[1:26:32] was more missionaries than ever uh uh
[1:26:35] than any other age we've had. The great
[1:26:37] missionary age of Wesley's time. But
[1:26:40] Pentecost represented Mary. Mary the the
[1:26:44] last the last stage of it. Now she was
[1:26:46] not the seed yet. The life of the seed
[1:26:49] was in her but it hadn't matured yet. I
[1:26:52] feel religious. It hadn't matured yet.
[1:26:54] It was there but it wasn't matured. So
[1:26:57] it is with our Pentecostal age that
[1:26:59] we're living in. THEY'VE GOT TO COME
[1:27:01] FORTH, THERE'S GOT TO come forth a word
[1:27:04] of God. AMEN. THE INTERDENOMINATIONAL
[1:27:07] OUTSIDE OF THE REALMS OF THE
[1:27:08] DENOMINATION. Uh Luther went to the hus
[1:27:11] with his word, just shall live by faith.
[1:27:14] Wesley had two words, sanctification.
[1:27:16] Second definite WORK OF GRACE. PENTECOST
[1:27:18] HAD THE third word, restoration of the
[1:27:19] gifts. BUT THE ENTIRE SEED HAS TO COME
[1:27:23] FORTH. NOW see how they denominate on
[1:27:26] the word and another and another. Amen.
[1:27:28] ANOTHER PLACE HE SAYS THE SHOCK IS A
[1:27:30] CARRIER. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT OUR
[1:27:32] DENOMINATIONS has been a carrier. LUTHER
[1:27:36] WESLEY PENTECOSTALS. AND NOW IT'S time
[1:27:39] for the seed to come forth. She was not
[1:27:42] THE SEED. MARY WAS NOT. SHE WAS A SHOCK
[1:27:46] TASSEL STOP CARRIERS OF THAT PART OF the
[1:27:49] word but not all the word. Luther had
[1:27:52] justification. Wesley had
[1:27:53] sanctification. Pentecostals had
[1:27:55] restoration. But when the word come,
[1:27:57] they could produce what the
[1:28:00] justification will save a man. And and I
[1:28:02] believe that it's a carrier of the word.
[1:28:05] THE SAME AS THE STALK is part of the
[1:28:07] wheat. Sure it is. But it's a carrier.
[1:28:10] It ain't the life. And along come
[1:28:13] sanctification. How many believe in
[1:28:15] sanctification? You believe the Bible?
[1:28:17] You have to. Sure. So still it's a
[1:28:20] little more might be two words but then
[1:28:23] come the Pentecost the restoration of
[1:28:24] the gifts speaking in tonesues they call
[1:28:26] it the initial evidence of the Holy
[1:28:28] Ghost speaking in tonesues there and
[1:28:29] there they call the initial evidence
[1:28:31] amen that's the shock they denominated
[1:28:34] but when you can say I and my father are
[1:28:36] ONE THESE OTHER THINGS THEN THE SHUCK
[1:28:40] PULLS BACK NOW HE'S TRYING TO say when
[1:28:42] you say somebody say me
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; when you say I and my father ARE ONE THE
[1:28:47] SHUCK PULLS WAY THE REAL GENUINE BRIDE
[1:28:51] church will bring forth THE ENTIRE WORD
[1:28:55] OF GOD in its fullness in the in the
[1:28:58] midst for he's the same yesterday today
[1:29:01] and forever another quote we SEE HERE
[1:29:05] THE TRUE REVELATION OF THE TRUE TYPE
[1:29:07] THERE ARE THREE WOMEN CARRIERS of the
[1:29:10] natural seed until the matured into
[1:29:13] Jesus another one CANNOT DO IT NOW IT IS
[1:29:17] SEED TIME OR BRIDE TIME, THE SHUCKS ARE
[1:29:19] DEAD, THE DRIED UP, THE VIRGIN WORD
[1:29:22] TIME, not touched. Remember, virgin word
[1:29:25] time. Amen. In the third seal, he he
[1:29:28] says he says now, Amen. Uh uh and I and
[1:29:31] I'm putting a lot of these in here, but
[1:29:32] I just want y'all to catch this. Amen.
[1:29:34] Y'all can go back and look at these
[1:29:35] later. It says then the the third the
[1:29:37] three stages come come uh the the church
[1:29:41] out from sanctification or
[1:29:42] justification, SANCTIFICATION, BAPTISM
[1:29:45] OF THE HOLY GHOST AND THE incarnate God
[1:29:49] made manifest among us. Here he come the
[1:29:52] as the antichrist, the false prophet and
[1:29:55] then the beast then the dark age. Amen.
[1:29:57] But then the church come OUT OF THE DARK
[1:29:59] AGE, JUSTIFICATION, SANCTIFICATION,
[1:30:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost, incarnate
[1:30:04] word, the way now. So there's A THERE'S
[1:30:06] SOMETHING I'M TRYING TO I'M I'M TRYING
[1:30:08] TO GET TO YOU HERE IS HE'S NOT PUTTING
[1:30:10] you Amen. AS A HE'S NOT HE'S NOT HE'S
[1:30:15] NOT LOOKING AT HUMANITY AT ALL.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; HE'S NOT LOOKING AT HUMANITY AT ALL.
[1:30:20] HE'S NOT EVEN LOOKING AT AT AT MARY.
[1:30:24] HE'S LOOKING AT A SPECIAL CONDITION that
[1:30:28] you are. YOU'RE NOT A WOMAN PRODUCING.
[1:30:31] You are the very WIFE OF GOD AND you are
[1:30:37] producing his word in your flesh.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; It means something. It means something.
[1:30:45] It makes you It makes YOU WANT TO STAY
[1:30:48] TRUE to that. He is your husband. He is
[1:30:51] your Lord. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he he goes on. He says, "Here
[1:30:58] comes the Antichrist, the false prophet,
[1:31:00] and and uh or I've done read that one."
[1:31:02] He says, "Notice here, the life that was
[1:31:04] in the stalk tessle ends up in the seed.
[1:31:06] The life comes out. The original seed
[1:31:08] comes up through the different
[1:31:09] processes, three different processes,
[1:31:11] and then turns back to its original
[1:31:13] condition." In the masterpiece, he says
[1:31:15] there, see the three stages, stock,
[1:31:17] tassel, or pollen, then the husk, and
[1:31:19] then out of the husk, the original seed.
[1:31:21] Not a seed. It was the life of the seed
[1:31:24] growing through this to come to the
[1:31:27] seed. What is it? A resurrection coming
[1:31:30] back to a masterpiece.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Again.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says Pentecost came out
[1:31:38] of Wesley because Wesley was an
[1:31:40] organization. Pentecost came out as no
[1:31:42] organization. Then it turned right back
[1:31:44] to one. Amen. It had to to make the
[1:31:47] husk. The true word of life on it was on
[1:31:50] its way then to the original grain
[1:31:53] through the three stages. Amen. The
[1:31:56] stock and the pollen, the pollen into
[1:31:58] the husk and the husk made it seed. No.
[1:32:01] Stock, tassel, husk living.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Someone say stock
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; tassel.
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Husk
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; living.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; God's used those things. God used Hagar.
[1:32:15] God used Sarah. God use Mary. Amen. But
[1:32:21] here you are today. God couldn't even
[1:32:23] have another type that he could use.
[1:32:25] [laughter]
[1:32:26] You become the very word of God.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? Oh, that's the
[1:32:33] anointing that's upon you today. AMEN.
[1:32:35] NOW, I COULD JUST GO ON AND ON AND ON.
[1:32:38] AMEN. There's there's there's a lot of
[1:32:40] quotes in there. Another place in the
[1:32:41] Master of Peace, he says, Amen. He he
[1:32:43] says, "Justification made way for
[1:32:45] sanctification. Sanctification made way
[1:32:47] for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:32:48] Baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way for
[1:32:49] the Holy Ghost itself to come right down
[1:32:52] in perfection back to the word again to
[1:32:55] manifest itself.
[1:32:57] How can this be? I don't know. But I
[1:32:59] just say I believe it.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; How can this be? I'm in a I'm struggling
[1:33:04] AS A YOUNG WOMAN. I'M STRUGGLING AS A
[1:33:07] YOUNG MAN. I I don't know. But all I
[1:33:10] know is God's got a bride on this earth
[1:33:11] that says I believe the word.
[1:33:15] Can you say amen? Amen. Oh my. AS IT WAS
[1:33:21] IN THE DAYS OF SODOM, SO SHALL IT BE.
[1:33:25] AMEN. Brother Brandham in the
[1:33:27] restoration of the bride tree. He says
[1:33:29] now, he says, you can see the four
[1:33:30] messengers of death killed the tree. The
[1:33:32] four messengers of life restores the
[1:33:34] tree. Do you get it? Amen. God said, I
[1:33:36] will restore it. He's going to restore
[1:33:37] it now by the four messengers of death
[1:33:39] kill it. Four messengers of life to
[1:33:41] restore it. Amen. The first Martin
[1:33:43] Luther justification. What was the
[1:33:44] second? Wesley by sanctification. What
[1:33:46] was the third? Pentecost. Restoration of
[1:33:48] the gifts, Holy Ghost, baptism. WHAT IS
[1:33:50] THE FOURTH? THE WORD. WHAT? THE WORD.
[1:33:54] YOU SEE, THAT'S WHERE WE ARE TODAY.
[1:33:57] HALLELUJAH. God has He's got so much
[1:34:00] confidence in you. He's got so much
[1:34:02] confidence. He's not looking at your
[1:34:04] flesh. He's not looking at your ability.
[1:34:06] He's looking at the faith that he has
[1:34:08] predestinated you. Amen. That anointing
[1:34:12] is upon the earth. You're going to make
[1:34:14] it. There is no way for you to miss this
[1:34:17] because you are ordained to hear it. You
[1:34:19] are ordained to believe it. THERE'S
[1:34:22] SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE OF YOU THAT WILL
[1:34:25] NOT LET YOU. Come on now. Amen. Oh yeah,
[1:34:28] they can try to beat. Amen. It ain't it
[1:34:31] ain't the preacher beating you. It ain't
[1:34:33] mom and dad beating you. It's because
[1:34:34] the life of God that is uh from the
[1:34:37] throne of God here on this earth. It is
[1:34:39] a it's a RAPTURE ANOINTING. IT'S THE
[1:34:42] FLYING EAGLE TIME. It's It's coming to
[1:34:45] bring us up.
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, you are that very word.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; You look in the mirror and you're seeing
[1:34:53] all the grays and the wrinkles and
[1:34:54] you're seeing all the complexes. God's
[1:34:56] looking at you and he's just beaming
[1:34:58] with pride. His word is here and you're
[1:35:00] believing it and it's you're going to
[1:35:02] produce what he said.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:12] Do you love him?
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; When we sing that song, "Oh, I love him.
[1:35:16] Oh, how he loves you and me. He gave his
[1:35:18] life for me and you." But you see this
[1:35:20] today, we're not we're we're not in the
[1:35:23] in the Hagar stage and we're not in the
[1:35:25] Sarah stage and we're not even in the
[1:35:28] Mary stage. We are the bride of Jesus
[1:35:31] Christ.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Means a lot, folks.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; Mary Mary was she was the incubator.
[1:35:40] Amen. But God is calling you the seed.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Well, I thought it was wonderful.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:54] [applause]
[1:35:58] Brother, brother brother, brother
[1:35:59] brother Brown, brother Brown would say,
[1:36:01] listen to the authenticated prophet of
[1:36:03] God who appears in this last age. What
[1:36:06] he says FROM GOD, THE BRIDE will say,
[1:36:10] the bride and the prophet and the spirit
[1:36:13] and the prophet and the bride will BE
[1:36:16] SAYING THE SAME THING.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; And what they say will have already been
[1:36:21] said in the word.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? THE WORD HAS BECOME
[1:36:27] WORD. WE'VE COME TO THAT. OH,
[1:36:30] HALLELUJAH. It's easy for us. It's easy
[1:36:33] for us to make all of those apostles and
[1:36:35] the saints in in the book of Acts
[1:36:37] angels. Hallelujah. But I'm here to tell
[1:36:40] you there was a lot of there was a lot
[1:36:42] of humanity there. Well, Amen.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. But Peter, the one that was given
[1:36:48] the keys to the kingdom, went and and
[1:36:49] and gave gave the life to uh preached
[1:36:52] the gospel to the Gentiles. He was the
[1:36:54] first one to take him. Amen. Then we
[1:36:57] find out a chapter or two older that
[1:37:00] that that he is causing dissension.
[1:37:02] Amen. He's playing he's he's two-faced
[1:37:05] when he's with the Jews. He's with the
[1:37:06] Jews and then and then when the and and
[1:37:09] then when the Jews come in where the
[1:37:11] Gentiles were at, well, he was uhoh. He
[1:37:13] was trying to be nice with one or nice
[1:37:15] to the other. And uh and and then he
[1:37:18] because he was afraid of the Jews, he
[1:37:19] comes over and joins in and and ignores
[1:37:21] the Gentiles. And the Apostle Paul
[1:37:24] says,"I withtood him to his face and
[1:37:26] said, "You're wrong."
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; You're causing dissension and you
[1:37:30] shouldn't be doing that. And well, that
[1:37:33] was in the that was that was our two
[1:37:35] apostles. Hallelujah.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that that what what I'm
[1:37:40] saying is there's there were hum there
[1:37:42] was humanity that was there when the
[1:37:45] word w was was
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:37:49] when the the church that we are to
[1:37:51] approximate, the church that we're
[1:37:52] trying to be like is they had a lot of
[1:37:55] humanity.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Is that right? But the word was their
[1:37:59] absolute. Then we've gone through all of
[1:38:02] these other things and we've had all of
[1:38:04] these other ideas. Listen, we are not
[1:38:06] based on ideas anymore. We don't care
[1:38:08] what mama thinks, daddy thinks, grandma
[1:38:10] thinks. We don't care what the preacher
[1:38:12] thinks if it's not according to the word
[1:38:13] of God. We want what God's brought to
[1:38:16] us. AND THAT'S ALL THE BRIDE WILL hear
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; because we have arrived
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; once again.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; Not one word will be broken because she
[1:38:31] believes it all. Lots of mistakes, lots
[1:38:34] of failures, plenty of blood.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; But that faith is going to anchor to
[1:38:40] thus saith the Lord.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; If the musicians would come,
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:38:48] Amen.
[1:38:50] Now I quoted a lot out of the uh uh the
[1:38:53] seed is not heir with the shuck I and
[1:38:56] and then uh uh uh in 65 also there in
[1:39:01] the masterpiece in ' 65 and then we also
[1:39:05] used uh amen uh transformation of his
[1:39:09] word. Amen. These were all these were
[1:39:11] all messages just right there toward the
[1:39:13] end. And and here but but here in 65 uh
[1:39:18] seed is not heir with the shuck. He
[1:39:20] would say but when you say I and my
[1:39:22] father are one and these other things
[1:39:23] then the shuck pulls away. But the real
[1:39:26] genuine bride church will bring forth
[1:39:29] the entire word of God in its fullness
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; in their midst. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:39:48] He said preparation
[1:39:51] sent the messenger with a message. The
[1:39:54] next thing he done, [music]
[1:39:55] he sent the messenger or he he says he
[1:39:58] sent the messenger with a message. Then
[1:40:00] he sent the pillar of fire for a
[1:40:02] vindication.
[1:40:04] Next thing was after that was a
[1:40:06] consolation.
[1:40:08] You knew that it was right. You was at
[1:40:11] peace. We have [music] peace through
[1:40:15] with God through the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:40:19] And I say, "Oh, amen."
[1:40:23] Amen.
[1:40:26] Trying to do God a service without being
[1:40:27] his will. He said, "The evening message
[1:40:29] must carry evening results. The evening
[1:40:31] message must sew evening seeds. Not
[1:40:34] morning seeds. Evening seeds.
[1:40:37] it seeds.
[1:40:39] Back there was denomination. It died and
[1:40:41] perished. But the evening message will
[1:40:44] show evening time light
[1:40:47] and it will show evening time results.
[1:40:48] [music]
[1:40:50] The evening time message.
[1:40:53] And I say, Lord,
[1:40:55] I thank you for that.
[1:40:58] I I I [laughter] I think we're just
[1:41:00] we're we're we're right back. We're
[1:41:03] right back to the to [music] Mary, but
[1:41:06] in a more intimate way. God has taken
[1:41:09] you [music] as his bride.
[1:41:14] Mary,
[1:41:16] Virgin Mary, was not the bride of God.
[1:41:20] Amen.
[1:41:22] As the Catholic Church wants to put her,
[1:41:25] right?
[1:41:27] See, the Catholic Church [music] has
[1:41:29] taken
[1:41:31] mother, son, and father, and that's
[1:41:34] anyways.
[1:41:36] But tonight, this is legitimate.
[1:41:42] We are wearing the wedding band of
[1:41:44] predestinated grace.
[1:41:52] I love him.
[1:42:03] I [music] say
[1:42:07] that through
[1:42:09] through it all, and I know I ran through
[1:42:11] this real quick, but I just wanted to
[1:42:12] share it tonight.
[1:42:16] I I say that no matter what you're
[1:42:18] facing, [music] there's there's some of
[1:42:20] you here that's that's going through the
[1:42:24] change of life. You're doing that as a
[1:42:26] young man, young woman.
[1:42:29] [music] Those times can be a little bit
[1:42:31] rocky,
[1:42:34] but to know
[1:42:36] that you're secured in Jesus
[1:42:40] makes it so wonderful.
[1:42:44] And because
[1:42:49] of this of this change,
[1:42:55] there's going to be a lot of words said
[1:42:56] that you regret.
[1:43:01] There's going to be attitudes that you
[1:43:03] might have that
[1:43:06] and and [music] the devil will use those
[1:43:08] things with you young people
[1:43:12] to keep you [music] from prayer
[1:43:16] and
[1:43:18] but when there's condemnation and you're
[1:43:20] feeling [music] condemned, you're not
[1:43:22] going to pray with faith. You're not
[1:43:23] going to have a whole lot of confidence.
[1:43:25] You're not going to have that.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; And so the reason I wanted to bring all
[1:43:29] these quotes in, I brought a bunch of
[1:43:30] them in here tonight
[1:43:33] as Sarah struggled sometimes with that
[1:43:36] word in her part.
[1:43:40] Yet there came a Mary that says, "Be it
[1:43:42] unto me according to thy [music] word."
[1:43:45] We have come through the Hagars, the
[1:43:48] denominational systems. We have come
[1:43:50] [music] through the Sarah. We have come
[1:43:52] through,
[1:43:54] as the prophets would say, the shuck
[1:43:57] which the Lord manifested [music]
[1:43:58] himself through in the Pentecostal
[1:44:00] realm.
[1:44:04] But he said there's going to come one
[1:44:05] that he's going to manifest [music] his
[1:44:07] word, not just gifts, but he's going to
[1:44:10] manifest he himself, the Holy Ghost
[1:44:12] himself [music] coming and living.
[1:44:18] And I would say for any of you young
[1:44:20] men, young women, and sometimes
[1:44:24] I am not condoning sin.
[1:44:27] I'm not condoning sin.
[1:44:30] But I am saying there is a blood
[1:44:32] sacrifice
[1:44:33] for our sins.
[1:44:36] And when we repent [music]
[1:44:38] and we come to God,
[1:44:42] he is faithful and just [music]
[1:44:45] to forgive.
[1:44:48] our sins.
[1:44:54] Sometimes
[1:44:57] then you elders come along where [music]
[1:45:02] maybe you're going through menopause
[1:45:06] for you ladies and I don't know if
[1:45:09] [music] they call it menopause for guys
[1:45:10] or not. I think they just call it the
[1:45:11] midlife crisis for us guys. I don't
[1:45:13] know.
[1:45:19] But it's a changing time.
[1:45:22] And in that changing time, things get
[1:45:24] really,
[1:45:26] really wobbly. Things get a little
[1:45:28] blurry.
[1:45:31] [music] Maybe you say things that you
[1:45:33] thought, man, I would never would have
[1:45:34] said that. Or think ways, well, what I
[1:45:36] want. Where's that coming from? It's a
[1:45:39] you're getting upset or things bother
[1:45:41] you. You get nervous.
[1:45:43] things.
[1:45:45] Listen,
[1:45:51] there's still the [music] blood of
[1:45:53] Christ.
[1:45:56] The blood of Calvary is still for you.
[1:46:00] And in all of these things, remember the
[1:46:04] God that you have held to all throughout
[1:46:06] your life is going to take you right
[1:46:09] through that change of life.
[1:46:14] And if it helps you any at all, Brother
[1:46:16] Brandham says when you come through it,
[1:46:18] you're going to be [music] better than
[1:46:19] new.
[1:46:26] So, we go through those things and
[1:46:28] sometimes we feel we're feeling the the
[1:46:31] the the the [music]
[1:46:32] anxieties and things are there because
[1:46:34] the hormones and the things are going go
[1:46:37] going a little bit wacky or maybe a
[1:46:39] whole lot wacky.
[1:46:41] But Satan comes in with condemnation.
[1:46:44] And that's what I'm dealing with. Satan
[1:46:47] comes in and a and he takes this
[1:46:49] physical [music] thing that you're
[1:46:50] facing or that you're fighting and then
[1:46:52] he wants to whack you over the head with
[1:46:54] it.
[1:46:56] God is not even he's not comparing you
[1:46:58] to Hagar. He's not comparing you to
[1:47:00] Sarah. He's not even comparing you to
[1:47:03] Mary.
[1:47:09] You're his very own.
[1:47:12] Are you hearing me?
[1:47:20] So what we do is we come to [music] the
[1:47:22] Lord. We spend that time in prayer
[1:47:24] because if you can get condemnation,
[1:47:26] what we need in all of these times of
[1:47:27] our lives,
[1:47:30] we need that relationship with the Lord.
[1:47:33] And condemnation comes in and starts
[1:47:35] criticizing you and making [music] you
[1:47:36] feel like you're not one of his. Well,
[1:47:40] you know what?
[1:47:45] He's He's a liar.
[1:47:51] And he tries to take advantage of you
[1:47:53] and your weaknesses.
[1:47:56] He's not stupid.
[1:47:59] He tries to take advantage of us all.
[1:48:04] But when I look back at the grace that
[1:48:06] God [music] gave Sarah
[1:48:10] and when it was all said and done, she
[1:48:12] says, "The Lord [music] hath made me to
[1:48:14] laugh.
[1:48:16] The Lord has turned my sorrow into joy."
[1:48:20] Isaac means laughter.
[1:48:25] God turned it all around. God was with
[1:48:28] her the entire time. And I say yes, God
[1:48:31] [music] is with his people. Do you
[1:48:33] believe that tonight?
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music]
[1:48:38] And me.
[1:48:44] Oh, how
[1:48:47] he loves [music and singing] you
[1:48:51] and me.
[1:48:53] [singing]
[1:48:56] [music]
[1:48:57] He gave

[1:50:10] Oh, how [singing] he loves you,
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; oh Jesus. Oh, how
[1:50:18] he loves you.

[1:51:13] he loves you.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, how
[1:51:19] he loves me. [music]
[1:51:23] Oh,
[1:51:25] he loves you
[1:51:28] and

[1:52:22] There's got to be the damsel in distress
[1:52:26] and there's got to be the hero.

[1:52:34] stuff. [music] Amen. We want to see
[1:52:35] action.
