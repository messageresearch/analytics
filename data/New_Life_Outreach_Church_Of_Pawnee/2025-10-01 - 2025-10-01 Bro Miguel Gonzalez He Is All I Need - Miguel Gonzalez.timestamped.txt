[37:44] praises. And
[37:46] and really in life, he's all I need when

[38:15] everybody and
[38:17] everybody. Hey, brother Gadman.
[38:21] It's good to see brother Gadman and uh
[38:24] his wife here and and uh you know, we
[38:28] just go ahead and move into the
[38:29] scriptures here this evening. And uh we
[38:33] had a good time there up in Ohio and uh
[38:36] went to
[38:38] for sister Laura's uh surprise birthday
[38:41] party, 40th birthday party, you know.
[38:47] I hope I have a big 40th birthday party.
[38:53] It's all I got to say.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Apparently
[38:57] &gt;&gt; I got to make it to 30. Oh, okay. Yeah.
[39:00] physically I'm there but I'm just
[39:01] lacking it mentally I guess you know but
[39:04] we could um but just good it's good to
[39:07] see everybody that made it back good to
[39:09] see everybody here you know if we could
[39:11] I'd just like to go ahead and move on
[39:13] into our scriptures here in Matthew uh
[39:16] 25th chapter the or sorry the sixth
[39:21] chapter the 25th verse we'll be reading
[39:24] a few scriptures here this is where kind
[39:28] of um draw our text her this evening.
[39:32] But uh if you're there, just say man.
[39:36] Amen.
[39:38] Again, just good to see everybody here.
[39:40] It says here, starting in the 25th
[39:42] verse, it says, "Therefore, I say unto
[39:44] you, take no thought for your life what
[39:47] you shall eat or what you shall drink,
[39:50] nor yet for your body, what you shall
[39:53] put on. It is not the life more than
[39:57] meat and the body than raignment. Behold
[40:00] the fowls of the air, for they sow not,
[40:02] neither do they reap, nor gather into
[40:05] barns, yet your heavenly Father feedth
[40:08] them. Are ye not much more better than
[40:11] they?
[40:12] Which of you by taking thought can add
[40:16] one cubit unto his stature? Look at that
[40:19] there. He says, now look at this. says,
[40:21] "Which of you by taking thought can add
[40:25] one cubit unto his stature?
[40:28] And why take he thought for the
[40:30] raignment? Considered the liies
[40:33] of the field, how they grow, they toil
[40:36] not, neither do they spin. And yet I say
[40:39] unto you, that even Solomon in all his
[40:42] glory was not a raid like one of these.
[40:45] Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of
[40:48] the field, which today is today is, and
[40:51] tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he
[40:54] not much more clothe you, oh ye of
[40:58] little faith? Therefore, take not
[41:00] thought, saying, What shall ye eat, or
[41:02] what shall you drink, or wheither shall
[41:05] ye be clothed? For all things do thee,
[41:08] Greeks seek.
[41:10] For your heavenly Father knoweth that ye
[41:12] have need of all the things. But seek ye
[41:16] first the kingdom of God and his
[41:19] righteousness, and all these things
[41:21] shall be added unto you. Take therefore
[41:24] no thought for the tomorrow, for the
[41:26] tomorrow shall take thought for the
[41:28] things of itself.
[41:30] Sufficient unto the day is the evil
[41:33] thereof. Let's just go to the Lord in
[41:35] prayer. Heavenly Father, we love you
[41:37] here this evening.
[41:39] We just want to let you know that we
[41:41] appreciate you. We're just thankful for
[41:43] your presence, Lord. And we're thankful
[41:45] for all our gifts, Lord, the things that
[41:48] you put among us, Lord, to just lift
[41:50] your name, Lord. And I would just ask,
[41:53] Father, that you would just move us out
[41:54] of the way here this evening, Lord, that
[41:56] we just say what's needed to be said,
[41:59] Lord, and that there would be anything
[42:00] that's not, Lord, just be moved aside.
[42:03] Father, we appreciate you, Lord. We I
[42:06] can't do this without you, Father. Lord,
[42:08] none of us can do life even without you.
[42:10] Lord, I would just ask that you'd be
[42:12] with us and you be pleased by the things
[42:14] that have been said and done. We ask
[42:16] these things in Jesus name. Amen. And
[42:18] you could be seated here this evening.
[42:22] And if I had a text here this evening,
[42:24] it would be
[42:26] He is all I need.
[42:29] Now, thinking of this, um,
[42:32] I was talking to a brother here this
[42:34] weekend about, uh, uh, you know, he's a
[42:38] missionary brother. It's Brother
[42:39] Zachary, you know, and and, uh, Brother
[42:42] Zachary, I was talking to him, you know,
[42:43] cuz he's made plenty of missionary
[42:45] trips, you know, kind of around the
[42:46] world and and, uh, you know, South
[42:48] America, Latin America, kind of those
[42:51] areas like that. And then I had asked
[42:52] him, I was just like cuz um it was the
[42:55] day before he was leaving and you know
[42:57] and usually in a time like that, you
[42:58] know, you're kind of scrambling back and
[43:00] forth and whatnot and you're kind of
[43:02] just wondering what you're going to take
[43:03] for a trip, especially long distance
[43:05] overseas, you know. And I'd asked him, I
[43:07] said, "Hey, um yeah, you I was like,
[43:10] "Are you planning your trip?" And he's
[43:11] like, "Yep. In fact, I'm leaving in the
[43:12] morning." And I said, "Well, you all
[43:13] packed up?" And he's like, "Yep." And I
[43:15] was just like I was like, "Okay." And I
[43:17] was like, "So, um you got everything you
[43:19] need?" And I said, he's like, "Yep." And
[43:21] he goes, I said, "Well, I'm sure you got
[43:23] this figured out." And he's like, "Yep."
[43:25] And he I was like, "Well," he says,
[43:27] "I've done it plenty enough times. I
[43:29] know what I need to take and all the
[43:30] things that I need to take and all the
[43:32] things that I don't need to take." And
[43:33] and I kind of thought about that, you
[43:35] know, and I kind of thought about how
[43:37] that, you know, sometimes,
[43:39] you know, in uh in life, you know,
[43:41] especially if you're doing, you know,
[43:43] any kind of traveling or you're making
[43:45] any types of preparation for events or
[43:47] you're doing anything like that that you
[43:49] know, there's a lot of things that have
[43:51] got to be thought of. there's always
[43:52] somebody like a master planner or
[43:54] coordinator or something or there's
[43:56] somebody that's always kind of trying to
[43:57] put these things together in order for
[43:59] in order for everything to kind of go
[44:01] real smooth and kind of kosher like you
[44:03] know and I just uh you know and I was
[44:04] thinking about that about how that you
[44:06] know many of us have taken trips and you
[44:08] know there's always um there's always
[44:10] those things that you just uh you just
[44:12] sometimes you just not you don't know
[44:14] and if you're planning a trip you're
[44:16] always trying to uh account for the
[44:18] unseen because you're going to be away
[44:20] from your natural surroundings you you
[44:21] know, and and so you're always, you
[44:23] know, you're always like like me, I like
[44:26] a lot of undershirts. I just I don't
[44:29] lots of undershirts and socks. So, I've
[44:31] got like two pairs of jeans and 10
[44:33] undershirts and 10 pairs of socks. And
[44:35] my wife's always like, stop packing all
[44:37] these stuff. And I'm just like, you
[44:39] never know, you're going to need an
[44:39] extra undershirt, you know, and and uh
[44:42] so I've just got random things that I
[44:43] like to pack that I like to keep, you
[44:45] know, and so for on trip, there's a lot
[44:46] of different things, you know, if you're
[44:48] making a uh you know, if you're if
[44:50] you're traveling on the road, there's
[44:51] there's some things you might want to
[44:52] take. If you're on the road, you know,
[44:54] there's the you know, there's obviously
[44:55] you know, you want to make sure that you
[44:56] have uh if you're driving the vehicle,
[44:58] you make sure you have your jack, you
[44:59] know, you got your you know, your
[45:01] four-way, you know, you got some snacks
[45:03] in the car, you know, and just don't
[45:05] forget the snacks. And then and you you
[45:07] know water you know if you if you drink
[45:11] water on the road you know if you you
[45:13] know you might have water you know you
[45:15] got to make sure have your neck pillows
[45:17] and things you know things like that or
[45:19] you know if you might be going hunting
[45:20] or doing something you know if you
[45:22] you're going to make sure you got your
[45:23] boots and again your snacks you know you
[45:26] definitely you want to make sure you
[45:27] have plenty of snacks and and uh you
[45:30] make sure you got your flashlight and
[45:31] you got batteries in your flashlight you
[45:33] know and then make sure that when you
[45:34] bring your gun that you do have your
[45:36] bullets with you. You know, you got to
[45:38] make sure that, you know, that if you're
[45:40] going to make sure you got your hot
[45:41] hands, you know, you got your certain
[45:42] things. There's a whole list of things
[45:44] the whole list of things that you got
[45:46] when you're when you're making these
[45:47] kinds of uh uh when you're making these
[45:49] these kinds of uh trips or you know when
[45:51] you're going out there because you know
[45:53] you're you're trying to prepare, you're
[45:55] trying to plan, you're trying to do
[45:56] these things, you know, and then also
[45:58] like if somebody was going to somebody
[46:00] was going to run a race and and I
[46:02] promise you nobody around here is
[46:04] probably planning on running a race. I
[46:06] know I'm not, you know, but but if you
[46:08] do plan a race, there's going to be some
[46:09] things that you want to do. You'd
[46:11] probably you'd probably want to have,
[46:12] you know, the a nice pair of shoes. You
[46:15] know, you want to, you know, practice
[46:16] before the race, you know, uh you uh you
[46:19] know, uh uh you know, you're going to
[46:21] make sure you want to sleep well, you
[46:22] know, eat right, you know, drink right,
[46:24] and do a lot of these things, you know,
[46:26] and make sure that you know that that
[46:28] you're you're prepared for this race.
[46:30] and and you know and I began to think
[46:31] about about how that you know there's a
[46:34] lot of these things as we go through
[46:36] life and we go through these types of
[46:38] things or whatever the journey or
[46:40] whatever the thing that we're preparing
[46:42] for. A lot of you uh ladies you know
[46:43] that have prepared food events and
[46:45] different things. You know there's a lot
[46:47] of things that maybe at the very first
[46:48] time that you have done something that
[46:50] you realize after the 10th time there's
[46:52] things that you don't need. you know,
[46:53] there's certain things that you just
[46:54] leave behind because they're weighing
[46:56] you down or they're extra. You know,
[46:58] they're just, you know, it'd be not it's
[47:00] nice to have them, but we never really
[47:02] use them or or or you know, you guys,
[47:04] you've got things when you go out in the
[47:06] woods and you you know, first of all,
[47:07] you go out there and you got like 10
[47:09] bags on you because you just never know
[47:11] what you're going to need. But after
[47:12] carrying all that weight and after
[47:14] sweating and after after doing that,
[47:16] you're just like, you know, I don't
[47:17] think I really need that extra pair of
[47:19] boots and that that four four bottles of
[47:21] Gatorade and and and I really don't
[47:23] need, you know, seven seven different
[47:26] calls to go out there, two weapons, you
[47:28] know, I'm just going to need my bow. I'm
[47:30] just going to need my pants. I'm just
[47:31] going to need my, you know, I'm just
[47:33] going to need my one call, my scent
[47:34] block, and you know, I'm just going to
[47:36] go out there because, you know, I got to
[47:37] drag a deer if I get something, you
[47:39] know, come I don't want something
[47:40] weighing me down. I don't want
[47:41] something, you know, holding me back or
[47:43] doing these kinds of things, you know,
[47:44] and I feel like that that, you know,
[47:46] that carries on to a spiritual aspect of
[47:49] of life that because what what happened
[47:51] is is is, you know, we go through life
[47:53] and as we as we begin to as we begin to
[47:56] go through, we pick up things that we
[47:57] don't necessarily need that weighs us
[47:59] down when our spiritual walk with the
[48:01] Lord and and how that, you know, there's
[48:04] there's a lot of things that we develop
[48:05] over time. the things like we we accept
[48:08] responsibilities that that would that
[48:10] that kind of hinder us from being able
[48:13] to spend time with the Lord when when as
[48:16] a believer that the one main thing we
[48:18] our desire is is to please him and
[48:20] that's not to please you know our best
[48:22] friend not to please a boyfriend not to
[48:24] please a girlfriend but our our full
[48:26] desire is to be able to please him and
[48:29] when we realize you know what as I said
[48:31] before the the the objects that we feel
[48:34] like that we need to have when we go on
[48:35] our trips, we we realize that we can
[48:37] leave those things but be behind and we
[48:40] can we can make more rooms for other
[48:42] things that are necessary. And I begin
[48:44] to find that same way in in our walk
[48:46] with the Lord that that there's a lot of
[48:48] things in life that we carry. There's a
[48:50] lot of things that in our life that that
[48:52] that that's not necessary to to our walk
[48:55] with God and it actually drags us down.
[48:57] And some of these things and that that
[48:59] that could be self-inflicted. Some
[49:01] things uh some of these things can be
[49:03] inflicted on from without you know from
[49:06] without the church or even from within
[49:08] the church. You know, some things that
[49:09] some brother might have said something
[49:11] that you might have taken not quite
[49:13] right. Or maybe you had said something
[49:15] to offend a brother and it's kind of
[49:16] grieving you in your spirit or grieving
[49:18] them in their spirit. Or or there might
[49:20] be uh something that that that you
[49:23] thought or or maybe it's just something
[49:25] that a mind battle that you might be
[49:27] facing in in in your mind about some
[49:30] about how that you perceive somebody's
[49:32] thoughts about you and it keeps you from
[49:34] being uh close with him and it keeps you
[49:37] from sharing with him, you know, and and
[49:39] and sometimes there's, you know, there's
[49:41] a lot of these these little things that
[49:43] little foxes, as the scripture says,
[49:45] that spoils the vine that, you know,
[49:47] that keeps brotherhood, you know, from
[49:49] being to from being tight and
[49:51] unbreakable or keep sisterhood from
[49:53] being tight and unbreakable, you know,
[49:55] and and the devil would like to do these
[49:57] things. He would like to add things upon
[49:59] your life to be able to keep you from
[50:01] reaching your goals in life. And and he
[50:03] wants to put he wants to put weights on
[50:05] you to to be able to not for for you to
[50:08] not enter into a service where whereas
[50:10] you would come in or before you could
[50:12] come into a service and you could lift
[50:14] your hands and you could shake off the
[50:16] things of the world. But Satan has put
[50:18] so much things on your spiritual mind
[50:20] about about about how that you're not
[50:22] worthy enough or about how that maybe
[50:24] about how that uh uh you know that
[50:27] you're just too sinful or about how that
[50:29] you know uh you're not deserving or
[50:32] there's you know you can go into the
[50:33] shelf of Satan's uh Satan's pawn shop or
[50:36] you can go to the shelf and and you can
[50:38] pick off anything that pick off anything
[50:40] that you want to try to fill the void.
[50:42] But the thing is is we can look in our
[50:44] scriptures and we can we can look and we
[50:46] can find that there's a lot of things
[50:48] that there's a lot of things that we can
[50:50] look at for the uh for the Lord to be
[50:52] able to move in our lives. And uh you
[50:55] when it was talking about these weights
[50:57] it all it kind of reminded me of of a
[50:59] scripture
[51:02] uh kind of reminded me of scripture here
[51:04] in Hebrews 12:1. says, "Wherefore,
[51:06] seeing we we we also are compassed about
[51:10] with so great a cloud of witness, let us
[51:13] lay aside every weight and the sin which
[51:16] does so easily beset us, and let us run
[51:18] with patience the race that is set
[51:21] before us." And then thinking about this
[51:23] as let us set let us set let us set
[51:26] aside every weight in sin which so
[51:28] easily beset us. and you can try to be
[51:31] able to maybe ma if you could maybe just
[51:33] be able to take the magnet of God's word
[51:36] over your life here this evening and you
[51:37] can maybe pick out some small things and
[51:40] that are in your life whether they're
[51:41] small whether they're big it really
[51:42] doesn't matter to God because everything
[51:44] whether it's small or big keeps you out
[51:46] of his presence and keeps you keeps you
[51:49] away from being able to receive the word
[51:51] or be able to receive the blessings that
[51:53] God already has provided God has already
[51:56] has restored or has already uh reserved
[52:00] for you to be able to get. And and now
[52:02] we talked about a spiritual uh you know,
[52:04] we talked about a a spirit or not a
[52:07] spiritual, we talked about a physical,
[52:08] you know, a trip or something like that
[52:10] and and taking away the things that
[52:13] taking away the things off of the trip
[52:15] that would keep you that would hinder
[52:16] you. And we also talked about how that
[52:18] there's always got to be somebody that's
[52:20] planning the trip, somebody that's
[52:22] keeping these things going. But but
[52:23] really if we if we look back and and and
[52:26] we put on our kind of our spiritual
[52:28] blinders or our spiritual uh glasses
[52:30] here this evening, we can see that the
[52:32] Lord before our before we were born,
[52:35] before we were thought of, before that
[52:37] before that your parents had ever
[52:38] thought about children or your
[52:40] grandparents thought about their
[52:41] children, that God was thinking about
[52:43] you. And he knew that through the line
[52:45] that you were born of, whether you're a
[52:47] Lancaster, whether you're a Martin,
[52:49] whether you're a Stout, whether you're
[52:51] Gonzalez, whether you're a fairweather,
[52:53] whether you're this or that, you know
[52:54] that there's going to be certain things
[52:56] that is inside of your life that you're
[52:58] going to be dealing with. And you might
[53:00] not deal with the same thing that the
[53:02] Martins deal with the Stouts or the
[53:04] Fairweathers, deal with the Lancasters
[53:06] or or you know, take your pick of the
[53:08] family. And there's certain things that
[53:10] that there are certain things that we
[53:11] would have to deal with and we would
[53:13] have to fight with and and and and in
[53:15] order to succeed in the physical realm
[53:18] and physical life that we live in in
[53:20] order to succeed and to and to move
[53:22] forward in life. Uh you have to lay them
[53:25] things aside and there has to be a
[53:27] master plan and there has to be
[53:29] provisions for that for that vision or
[53:32] for whatever project you're doing to be
[53:34] able to move forward. and in doing so
[53:36] with your spiritual walk. Now, we're not
[53:38] talking about the natural, but we're
[53:40] talking about the spiritual. We're
[53:42] talking about your spiritual walk with
[53:44] God. Where do you want to see your life
[53:46] here in the next year, in the next 5
[53:48] years, in the next 10 years? and and and
[53:51] you could see back and we can look here
[53:53] spiritually now that we take the magnet
[53:55] of God's word and and whether we're
[53:57] lacking in our spiritual lives, whether
[53:59] we're whether we're putting our our
[54:01] daily our daily uh uh uh uh desires or
[54:05] whether we're putting our our our our
[54:07] daily goals, whether we're trying to
[54:09] succeed in school, whether we're trying
[54:10] to succeed in work, whether we're trying
[54:12] to succeed in whether we're trying
[54:14] trying to succeed in uh business. I mean
[54:16] uh whether we're trying to succeed in
[54:18] just whatever it might be that that that
[54:21] should only be a secondary to the the
[54:24] actual plan for your life and all things
[54:27] that everything that we strive for
[54:30] everything that we're looking at here at
[54:31] life is actually vain. Everything that
[54:33] we're going to do doesn't matter how
[54:35] smart you are. It doesn't matter the
[54:37] things that you that you've been able to
[54:38] accomplish. It doesn't matter how many
[54:40] plaques. It doesn't matter how many
[54:41] titles to properties that you hold.
[54:43] doesn't matter of any any types of those
[54:45] things. All those things are going to
[54:47] crash and burn. But there's one thing
[54:49] that we know that when when when this
[54:51] world becomes not when when there's when
[54:53] there's when there's no skyscrapers,
[54:55] when there's no planes, when there's no
[54:56] countries, when there's no when there's
[54:58] no world that it cease to that when the
[55:00] world cease to exist, that we know this
[55:02] one thing that the kingdom of God will
[55:05] stand assure. We know that there's one
[55:07] thing that that that our trust and our
[55:10] hope in Jesus is greater than what we
[55:12] can accomplish. But during this thing
[55:14] and during this process of life that
[55:16] we're going through, we begin to claim
[55:18] baggage. Even in our spiritual life, we
[55:20] named out just a few of the things we
[55:22] were talking about. We were talking
[55:23] about uh you know a spiritual baggage
[55:25] and we're talking about hurt feelings or
[55:27] we're talking about uh uh we're talking
[55:29] about uh uh uh things that might have
[55:31] been said or or we might have been we
[55:34] might have been uh been depressed in in
[55:36] in our spirits because you know there's
[55:38] just things don't seem to be going that
[55:40] way. Now these things are baggages upon
[55:43] the life of the believer. Now, these are
[55:45] things that if we don't lay down, as the
[55:47] scripture says this, uh, lay down every
[55:50] sin which does easily beset us and run.
[55:53] Amen. Then all we're going to do is
[55:54] remain in neutral. And that's not a good
[55:57] state. You're neither coming or and
[55:58] you're neither going. You're just
[56:00] staying in the same place because the
[56:02] situation that you're dealing with in
[56:04] your life, amen, has has weighed you
[56:07] down. It it's began to try to pull you
[56:10] away. But but so some of these things
[56:13] that we're looking at, we see here it
[56:15] says now now if we can begin to look at
[56:18] this, we we begin to see that that uh
[56:21] hold on, let me get to a scripture here.
[56:22] It says, now if if we can look at this,
[56:25] there's some of these things that we
[56:26] have. Now the scriptures here in Genesis
[56:28] 5:16-22,
[56:30] it says, "Say I then thee, walk in the
[56:32] spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the
[56:34] lust of the flesh. For the uh for the
[56:37] flesh lusteth against the spirit, and
[56:39] the spirit against the flesh, and these
[56:42] are contrary one to another, so that ye
[56:45] cannot do the things that ye would. But
[56:47] if ye be led of the spirit, ye are not
[56:50] under the law. Now the works of the
[56:52] flesh are manifest. Which are these?
[56:54] Now, these are the things that could
[56:56] that could weigh us down in our
[56:57] spiritual walk. These are things that
[56:59] could that could drag anchor. I mean,
[57:01] are you with me? You know, it's some of
[57:03] these things that that you just throw
[57:04] down off into the back and and they're
[57:06] holding you down in your spiritual walk.
[57:08] Some of these things are adultery,
[57:10] fornication, uncleanness, lasiness,
[57:14] idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
[57:17] emulation, wrath, strife, sedition,
[57:19] heresies, envy, envying, murder,
[57:22] drunkenness, revailing, and such like of
[57:24] the which I tell you before. I have also
[57:27] told you in times past that ye or that
[57:30] they which do such things shall not
[57:32] inherit the kingdom of God. Now, how
[57:35] many you want to inherit the kingdom of
[57:36] God here this scene? I mean, isn't that
[57:38] the goal is is to be inherit the kingdom
[57:41] of God. Now, the kingdom of God is a if
[57:44] you could think about yes is a literal
[57:46] place. But the kingdom of God, Amen, is
[57:48] is his word in the entirety in Jesus
[57:52] Christ. to obtain Christ is to obtain
[57:55] his kingdom. Now to think about this,
[57:57] but the fruits now now when we when we
[58:00] get rid of some of these things
[58:01] spiritually out of our life, you got to
[58:03] have something to fulfill because you
[58:05] know to anybody that's ever been through
[58:07] that point of life to where you know you
[58:09] you you you just went into this rut and
[58:12] you and you've been addicted to you've
[58:14] been addicted to a a a depression or
[58:17] you've been addicted to just a bad
[58:19] mentality against the word of God or
[58:21] just a bad attitude and you're addicted
[58:23] to, you know, the this mind battles.
[58:25] battles that you've been going through
[58:27] or you're just addicted to, you know,
[58:28] these things that have consistently run
[58:31] your life before. Now, if you and now to
[58:34] be able to lay these things aside, you
[58:36] must be able to put something in its
[58:38] place. And because there's got to be
[58:39] something that's greater than what
[58:42] you're leaving to be able to fulfill the
[58:44] position. Now, the scripture says here
[58:46] is in the 22nd verse, but the fruit of
[58:49] the spirit is love.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; It is joy. It is peace, longsuffering,
[58:55] gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness,
[58:58] temperance. Against such there's no law.
[59:00] In other words, God's like, I don't have
[59:02] a problem with these things. I don't
[59:04] have a problem with you having joy in
[59:06] the morning when you wake up instead of
[59:07] waking up and and assessing all of your
[59:10] problems that you have and obsessing all
[59:12] of the insecurities that you have and
[59:15] obsessing all of the sicknesses that you
[59:17] have and obsessing all of the uh
[59:19] whatever it is that keeps you bogged
[59:21] down from living free in the spirit. He
[59:24] says, "I" He says, "I don't have a
[59:25] problem with you having temperance in
[59:28] your life. I don't have a problem with
[59:30] you having joy and peace, but I want you
[59:32] to get rid of these other things so that
[59:34] so that the word could rule in your
[59:36] life. Now, thinking about this now, if
[59:38] there's now, if if we get rid of all of
[59:41] the natural things and we've narrowed
[59:43] down the natural things to uh that we
[59:46] need for the journey or whatever it is
[59:48] we're going through, we need to be able
[59:50] to narrow down exactly in our spiritual
[59:53] walk. the thing that would be able to
[59:56] get us down the road and be a successful
[59:58] Christian. Now, if we're not careful
[1:00:00] now, and now I'm really huge and I and I
[1:00:03] and I like consolidation. I like being
[1:00:05] able to take a lot of different I'm that
[1:00:07] kind of guy that, you know, if I'm going
[1:00:09] to go to such and such place over here
[1:00:11] to Steel Water, you know, I'm going to
[1:00:13] I'm going to go stop at Lock and I got
[1:00:14] to go stop by Elliot and I got to go
[1:00:16] stop by this place and I'm going to go
[1:00:18] check out wood here and I'm going to go
[1:00:19] do this. So, I'm going to do all these
[1:00:21] different things all at one time. So you
[1:00:24] can go and you can look and you can find
[1:00:26] the scriptures. Find in the scriptures
[1:00:28] what is it that is the focal point that
[1:00:31] funnels down to everything that is
[1:00:33] fulfilled in all in in in one in all in
[1:00:36] one and you all in one and that is in
[1:00:39] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today
[1:00:42] and forever. You can funnel down all
[1:00:45] these things down into Jesus Christ. And
[1:00:47] you can look if you go and you read into
[1:00:49] your scriptures, you can find where
[1:00:51] there's a lot of key witnesses of people
[1:00:54] that were willing to risk that were
[1:00:56] willing to that were that were willing
[1:00:58] to to to to be able to lay their desires
[1:01:02] to be able to lay their will to lay
[1:01:04] their will on the line for the word.
[1:01:07] Now, if you go back and you you look
[1:01:08] here in the scripture, you begin you can
[1:01:11] go and you can find you can find the
[1:01:13] widow woman. The widow woman, the cruise
[1:01:16] of oil. Now think about this. He says
[1:01:18] over there in first Kings 17:9-16
[1:01:22] and it and it reads like this starting
[1:01:23] here at the ninth verse, get thee to
[1:01:26] Zerapath
[1:01:27] which belongth to to uh is Zidon
[1:01:32] Zidon. We'll go with Zidon
[1:01:35] and dwelleth and dwelleth there. Behold,
[1:01:37] I've commanded the widow woman there to
[1:01:39] sustain me. So he had rose and he went
[1:01:42] to Zerapath. And when he had come to the
[1:01:44] come to the gate of of the city, behold
[1:01:47] the woman which was which was gathering
[1:01:49] of which was gathering sticks and he
[1:01:51] called to her. And he said, "Fetch me, I
[1:01:54] pray thee, a little water in the vessel
[1:01:56] that I might drink." And he and she was
[1:01:59] going to fetch it. He called to her and
[1:02:01] says, "Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel
[1:02:04] of bread in thy hand." And she said, "As
[1:02:06] the Lord thy God liveth, I have not not
[1:02:09] a cake, but a handful of meal in thy
[1:02:11] barrel, and a little oil in the cruise,
[1:02:13] and behold, I'm gathering two sticks
[1:02:15] that I might go and dress it for me and
[1:02:17] my son, that we may eat, and we may
[1:02:19] die." And Elijah said to her, said to
[1:02:22] her, "Fear not, and go do as I as do as
[1:02:26] thou hast said, but make me therefore a
[1:02:29] little cake first." Now, think about
[1:02:30] this. Amen. You you you're in the middle
[1:02:32] of a situation. And I mean, you're
[1:02:34] you're there there's a famine in the
[1:02:36] land. There's I mean, there's I mean,
[1:02:37] there's only so everybody's only got so
[1:02:40] much. And and I'm sure that I'm sure
[1:02:42] that if they could, every neighbor would
[1:02:44] try to help each other, but but but it
[1:02:46] just wasn't it wasn't it wasn't
[1:02:47] happening. It was just it wasn't going
[1:02:49] to happen. And and she had already made
[1:02:50] up in her mind, as the scripture says,
[1:02:52] that that she was going to get these two
[1:02:54] sticks. She's going to make a fire and
[1:02:55] she's going to get and she's going to
[1:02:57] get these little cakes right here, and
[1:02:58] she's going to make it for her and and
[1:03:00] her child and and they're going to die.
[1:03:02] But but you think about this now. What
[1:03:04] was the prophet? The prophet was the
[1:03:06] word. And the word came to this little
[1:03:08] lady. Now think about this. And he had
[1:03:10] given her a commandment. You know,
[1:03:13] because because now think about it. God
[1:03:15] spoke God spoke to the prophet and said,
[1:03:19] uh, I have commanded a widow woman there
[1:03:22] to s to sustain the now. down did the I
[1:03:25] don't think according to the scripture
[1:03:27] here if you go down and you read the
[1:03:28] whole thing that the widow woman really
[1:03:30] got the memo because I don't think there
[1:03:32] would have been any types of hesitation
[1:03:35] if she would have got God would have
[1:03:36] been like hey I'm going to have my
[1:03:37] prophet come down here and you're going
[1:03:39] to feed him and and and don't worry
[1:03:41] about it because you know that you know
[1:03:42] because uh uh uh uh uh uh because after
[1:03:46] it's all done I'm going to I'm going to
[1:03:47] make sure you never run dry everything's
[1:03:49] going to be okay everything's going to
[1:03:50] be good and you know everything's just
[1:03:52] going to move along. But when the but
[1:03:54] when the prophet came up to her he said
[1:03:56] hey be before you cook that give me to
[1:03:58] eat first. Now, we're going to finish
[1:04:00] this portion here. And it says, "For
[1:04:02] thus saith though," or for and Elijah
[1:04:04] said unto here, "Fear not. Go and do as
[1:04:06] thou hast said, but make me make me
[1:04:09] thereof a little cake first, and bring
[1:04:11] it unto me, and after make for thee, and
[1:04:14] for thy son, for for thus saith the Lord
[1:04:16] God of Israel, the barrel of meal shall
[1:04:19] not waste, neither neither shall the
[1:04:21] cruise of of oil fill until the day that
[1:04:24] the Lord hath sendeth rain upon the
[1:04:26] earth." And she went and did according
[1:04:28] to the saying of Elijah. And she said he
[1:04:31] in her house did eat many days and the
[1:04:33] barrel of me of meal wasted not neither
[1:04:37] did the cruise of oil according to the
[1:04:40] word of the Lord which was spanked by
[1:04:43] Elijah. Now think of this. I mean this
[1:04:45] woman she had the very last of of the
[1:04:47] what she had had. But yet she had she
[1:04:50] had come and and she knew that the
[1:04:52] prophet Amen. that anything that come
[1:04:54] out of his mouth, anything that he'd
[1:04:56] said, anything that was spoken unto him,
[1:04:58] that God would back him up. And she was
[1:05:00] willing to give the last of what she
[1:05:02] had. In other words, I I feel here this
[1:05:04] evening that there's a lot of us if
[1:05:06] we're where we might be at to the point
[1:05:08] to where we can give. Amen. The last of
[1:05:10] what we've got because, you know, Lord,
[1:05:12] you see the bank account and and and
[1:05:15] Father, you see the bills that are
[1:05:16] coming due, Lord. And you see my car,
[1:05:18] Father, Father, you see that it needs
[1:05:20] these parts, Lord Jesus. and and and
[1:05:23] God, you see how I got to pay these
[1:05:25] medical bills or Lord, you know, I need
[1:05:27] I need uh some clothes or I need you,
[1:05:29] Lord, to provide food at my house, Lord.
[1:05:32] I need you to do this or I need you to
[1:05:34] do that. But if you're not careful,
[1:05:35] you're going to miss the word that come
[1:05:37] right by your way to be able to give you
[1:05:39] exactly what you need at your time. And
[1:05:42] if God, amen, could send a prophet down
[1:05:45] to a woman there back in this time. It's
[1:05:47] the same God. Amen. That was the
[1:05:49] Jehovah, the provider for the widow
[1:05:52] woman. Is the same God here in 2025 to
[1:05:55] be able to provide. Amen. Your need.
[1:05:58] Now, what was that prophet doing? What
[1:06:00] was the word doing? The word didn't come
[1:06:02] down and and and just explain to the
[1:06:04] widow woman everything that was going
[1:06:06] on. But she had faith in the word. She
[1:06:09] had faith in the prophet of the hour.
[1:06:11] She had faith that God, amen, was the
[1:06:13] same yesterday, today, and forever. No
[1:06:16] doubt she had heard about the things
[1:06:17] that God did. And at that time that she
[1:06:20] believe that God could be willing to do
[1:06:21] the same thing. But you have to be
[1:06:23] willing to be able to come and submit to
[1:06:25] the word to let God to be able to
[1:06:27] provide for your need.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; We know that Israel was very staunch. We
[1:06:33] know that Israel was very literal when
[1:06:34] it come to when it come to God's word.
[1:06:37] You can go back and you can see the
[1:06:39] three Hebrew children there in Daniel
[1:06:41] 3:16. Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo
[1:06:44] answering and said unto the king, "Oh
[1:06:45] Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to
[1:06:48] answer thee
[1:06:51] in this matter." Look at the confidence
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; speaking to a king.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; The king had already told him that
[1:07:01] everybody has to bow to this image.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:06] And you know what the king of this world
[1:07:08] that we live in says that you have to
[1:07:10] bow to the situation that you live in.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; Says you have to bow to to what the
[1:07:20] doctors have diagnosed you.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; Says that you have to bow to that that
[1:07:25] you're always going to have to deal with
[1:07:27] with with with with the h infirmities in
[1:07:30] your body. says that you're always going
[1:07:32] to have to deal with with hatred toward
[1:07:34] your brother. Says that you're always
[1:07:36] going to have to deal with with these
[1:07:37] situations in your life. This is just
[1:07:39] the way that it's going to have to be.
[1:07:41] But yet, Amen. There's something about
[1:07:43] an individual that's willing to stand on
[1:07:45] God's word.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; There's something about somebody that's
[1:07:48] willing to to defy the odds. Now, think
[1:07:51] about it. You have these men right here
[1:07:52] before thousands before hundreds of
[1:07:55] thousands people all there and the image
[1:07:57] has gone up and there's millions and
[1:07:59] there's there's there's billions of
[1:08:01] people that have surrendered to the will
[1:08:03] of the devil.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; They surrender to the lie of the devil
[1:08:07] when they when when it says that you
[1:08:09] know what you're just going to have to
[1:08:10] live with a broken home and you're just
[1:08:12] going to have to live with with with
[1:08:13] with the state that you the cars that
[1:08:16] you've been dealt with. But let me tell
[1:08:18] you something.
[1:08:20] Let me answer you concerning this
[1:08:23] matter.
[1:08:26] If it be so,
[1:08:28] our God whom we serve is able to deliver
[1:08:31] us from the burning fiery furnace and he
[1:08:34] will deliver us out of thy hand. Oh
[1:08:37] king. Amen. That same confidence, amen,
[1:08:40] resonates right now into inside the
[1:08:42] hearts of the believers that no matter
[1:08:44] what, that we will not bend, that we
[1:08:46] will not bow, that we will not surrender
[1:08:49] to the ideology that we have to live
[1:08:51] subpar to the to what God would have for
[1:08:54] you, the blessings that God would have
[1:08:56] for you.
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Every every man in the world bowed. It
[1:09:02] was easy.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; It was easy to do it. The king said,
[1:09:06] "You know what? You know what? They just
[1:09:08] do this and everything's going to be
[1:09:10] okay. You're going to come out and
[1:09:11] you're going to bow. You know what? The
[1:09:12] world says that you have to bow with the
[1:09:14] ideology that you you know what that
[1:09:16] your children there's a good chance that
[1:09:18] your child might end up homosexual. You
[1:09:21] know, there's a there's an ideology out
[1:09:22] there that says that, you know what,
[1:09:24] that you might have to accept the idea,
[1:09:26] you know, what that that that the
[1:09:28] average statistics in America for a
[1:09:30] marriage is so many years and so many
[1:09:32] this and that it's normal for you guys
[1:09:34] to get into fight and to divide and and
[1:09:37] to be able to have this a child over
[1:09:39] here and and and all this and all that
[1:09:41] kind of nonsense and and and and it's
[1:09:44] it's a lot of people that have accepted
[1:09:46] the idea that yes, I'll just die of
[1:09:48] cancer or yes, I'll just die of diabetes
[1:09:50] or oh yes, I'll just die of this or I'll
[1:09:52] just die of that. That's just the way
[1:09:53] the world goes. They're just going to
[1:09:55] put me on medication all the way till I
[1:09:57] die. Oh king, let me answer you with
[1:10:00] assurityity when it comes to this
[1:10:02] matter. Amen. That though, Amen. Though
[1:10:04] I make my bed in hell, thou art there.
[1:10:06] Though though God slay me, yet I'll
[1:10:09] trust him. Yet God, I'll be there
[1:10:11] through the thick and thin. And Lord, I
[1:10:12] will not bow to the ideal that I have to
[1:10:15] live underneath what God has given me.
[1:10:19] Think about this.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; The scripture says Psalm 63:1-11,
[1:10:25] it says, "Oh God, thou art my God." Now,
[1:10:28] think about this. We know who wrote
[1:10:30] Psalms. Now, think about this. An
[1:10:32] individual that's gone through the good
[1:10:35] times and he's gone through the bad
[1:10:38] times.
[1:10:39] He's had his ups and downs when it comes
[1:10:41] to God, but yet he he can write these
[1:10:43] words.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; He could testify of these words. with
[1:10:48] the shity so much that God would pin him
[1:10:50] in his own Bible. He says here, he says,
[1:10:53] "Oh God, thou art God. Early will I seek
[1:10:55] thee early."
[1:10:58] It's got to be pretty important in my
[1:11:00] book to get up early.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Show up late to my own work.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; I will seek thee early.
[1:11:16] My soulraise
[1:11:18] the Lord
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; thirsteth
[1:11:22] for thee.
[1:11:25] My flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
[1:11:29] thirsty land
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; where no water is.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; It's pretty bad.
[1:11:36] You're pretty broken at that point.
[1:11:37] You're pretty to a point where it's
[1:11:38] just, you know what, God, I can't
[1:11:41] I I I I can't move another muscle
[1:11:44] without you. I'm dehydrated, Father. The
[1:11:47] very life of my body has come to a point
[1:11:49] to where, Lord, without your presence,
[1:11:51] I'm nothing. Father, it says to thee,
[1:11:54] thy power and thy glory, not man's
[1:11:57] glory. This man was a king.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; This man was anointed by the prophet
[1:12:03] himself. And he says, "To thee thy
[1:12:05] glory. To thee thy power."
[1:12:09] Oh, how every man and every every girl
[1:12:11] could do that here this morning. To be
[1:12:13] able to put your power to put your
[1:12:15] ability to be able to put the things
[1:12:17] that you esteem that accomplishments
[1:12:19] that you made to be able to put to lay
[1:12:22] those crowns at the feet of Jesus and
[1:12:24] said, "Thy king,
[1:12:26] let you have the glory and the
[1:12:28] preeminence in my heart and life."
[1:12:33] So as I have seen thee in the in the
[1:12:36] sanctuary,
[1:12:38] because thy loving kindness is better
[1:12:42] than life,
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; the Lord,
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; my lips shall praise thee,
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; thus will I bless thee while I live.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; I will lift up my hands unto thy name.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. My soul shall be satisfied as
[1:13:03] with marorrow and fatness, and my mouth
[1:13:05] shall praise thee with joyful lips. Do
[1:13:08] you think that every moment of David's
[1:13:10] life was joyful? Do you think that
[1:13:13] running from cave to cave and be chased
[1:13:15] and be and be and be and be and be and
[1:13:18] be just exiled from his kinsmen and
[1:13:21] exiled from from his brothers and his
[1:13:23] and his do you think every moment was
[1:13:26] just joy to his lips, but in the midst
[1:13:28] of sorrow? Yes.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; But in the midst of pain, but in the
[1:13:32] midst of sacrifice, and in the midst of
[1:13:35] all these things, my lips will praise
[1:13:37] thee.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; When I remember thee upon my bed, think
[1:13:44] about this. He's already said,
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; he's already said,
[1:13:53] "Oh God, thou art my God, early will I
[1:13:57] seek thee." He's already thinking about
[1:13:58] him in the morning.
[1:14:00] And when I remember thee upon my bed,
[1:14:04] look at that that Peton that pitter
[1:14:07] pattern that's taking place because he
[1:14:10] knows that without his essence. He knows
[1:14:13] that without his abilities. He knows
[1:14:14] that without God and he knows that
[1:14:16] without without him he's nothing. That
[1:14:18] because he's a lamb that's being led
[1:14:20] into the slaughter. He knows that he's a
[1:14:22] lamb. Amen. To be devoured by all the
[1:14:24] things of this world. But yet in the
[1:14:26] midst of all these things, my lips will
[1:14:28] praise thee, and I think of thee
[1:14:29] continually from morning to evening.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; He says,
[1:14:35] "And I meditate on thee in the night
[1:14:39] watches."
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; In the night watches.
[1:14:44] Think about some of these brothers that
[1:14:46] struggle with things in their lives as
[1:14:48] far as you know can not being able to
[1:14:50] sleep at night and you know devil
[1:14:53] tormenting your bodies and trying to
[1:14:54] keep you up and trying to keep you
[1:14:56] exasperated from the next day's worth.
[1:14:59] You just tell him that when I remember
[1:15:02] him upon my bed and I'll meditate upon
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; thee at the night watches.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; I'll meditate upon thee. Yeah, you're
[1:15:12] going to keep me up all night. you're
[1:15:13] going to try to do these things to my
[1:15:15] body and you're going to try to afflict
[1:15:16] me and you be able to keep me from doing
[1:15:18] it upon the duties. I'll just take that
[1:15:19] moment of time. Amen. To be able to give
[1:15:22] praises unto God and say, "Lord, I love
[1:15:24] you. Lord, Lord, I see these." What is
[1:15:26] it? It's because in the midst of his
[1:15:28] trial, you're giving joy in the midst of
[1:15:30] the trial. And when in the midst of that
[1:15:31] trial where joy's being done, God's
[1:15:33] being glorified in the midst of it. And
[1:15:35] God God can work in the midst of your
[1:15:38] faith. It says here, I'll get through
[1:15:40] this here in a second. It says, "Because
[1:15:42] my soul fallth hard after thee."
[1:15:46] Have you ever felt hard?
[1:15:48] Yeah. You have. You're married.
[1:15:51] All of a sudden, you felt hard. You felt
[1:15:53] head over heels. There's something about
[1:15:56] Jesus. There's something about his
[1:15:58] presence. There's something about him
[1:16:00] that he's actually physically not here,
[1:16:01] but yet his essence understands who you
[1:16:03] are.
[1:16:05] About how that you can go inside of your
[1:16:07] room and and all of a sudden, Amen. the
[1:16:09] where depression leaves and it ceases
[1:16:11] for a moment and his presence comes in
[1:16:13] there and it begins to fill the gap
[1:16:15] where where where you're longing inside
[1:16:17] of your soul. I mean it begins to come
[1:16:20] and it begins to seal away all the
[1:16:22] darkness that's what's in your life and
[1:16:24] the thing that you feel like you're
[1:16:25] missing and the thing you feel like
[1:16:26] you're longing after all of a sudden his
[1:16:28] presence becomes that fulfillment.
[1:16:31] He says, "Because thou hast been my
[1:16:33] help.
[1:16:36] Therefore, in the shadows of the wings
[1:16:37] will I rejoice. My soul followeth hard
[1:16:39] after thee. Thy right hand upholdeth
[1:16:42] thee. But but those that seek my soul to
[1:16:44] destroy it shall go in the lower parts
[1:16:47] of the earth. They shall fall by the
[1:16:49] sword.
[1:16:52] your enemy,
[1:16:54] the sickness that you're struggling
[1:16:56] with, the mind battle that you're
[1:16:57] struggling with, the the evilness that's
[1:16:59] coming against you that keeps you from
[1:17:01] from from that tries to keep you from
[1:17:03] reaching amen your true expectations of
[1:17:06] God for you in your life. The Lord
[1:17:11] is your shield.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Yes. It says because the soul follow or
[1:17:15] because they'll seek my soul to destroy
[1:17:16] it and shall go in the lower parts of
[1:17:18] the earth that shall fall by the sword
[1:17:19] and shall be a portion of or shall be a
[1:17:22] portion for foxes for the king shall
[1:17:25] rejoice in God. Everyone that swearth by
[1:17:27] him shall glory but the mouth of them
[1:17:30] shall speak lies shall be stopped. Now
[1:17:33] going on and going on going on to this,
[1:17:36] we we can begin to see where some of
[1:17:38] these men where they begin to where
[1:17:40] where we begin to go and begin to try to
[1:17:42] funnel these down into down into the
[1:17:44] spiritual sense of it where Jesus
[1:17:46] becomes the fulfillment of all it all
[1:17:49] and we begin to shake away all of the
[1:17:51] heavy weights that are on our lives and
[1:17:54] we begin to look and begin to realize in
[1:17:56] our spiritual walk that we can't do
[1:17:58] nothing within ourselves. But yet Jesus,
[1:18:01] Jesus, who is the word of God fulfilled
[1:18:04] in our day, the scripture says there in
[1:18:06] John 1:12 and 14, a familiar passage of
[1:18:09] scripture and starting at the first
[1:18:11] verse, in the beginning was the word and
[1:18:13] the word was with God and the word was
[1:18:16] God. Now we can go on down in the 12th
[1:18:19] verse. As many as received him, to them
[1:18:22] gave he power to become the sons of God,
[1:18:25] even to them that believe upon his name,
[1:18:27] which were born not of blood, nor of the
[1:18:29] will of flesh, nor of the will of man,
[1:18:31] but of God. And the word was made flesh,
[1:18:34] and dwelt among us, and beheld his glory
[1:18:36] to glory as the only begotten of the
[1:18:38] father, full of grace and truth there at
[1:18:41] the beginning again at the 14th verse.
[1:18:43] And the word was made flesh. The word,
[1:18:46] amen, came, amen, from that Jehovah that
[1:18:49] we were talking about there. That's the
[1:18:52] the Jehovah,
[1:18:53] the pro the Jehovah of the old has been
[1:18:56] put into Jesus Christ of the new and
[1:18:59] Jesus in this day that the word when it
[1:19:02] became flesh, amen, come back into his
[1:19:04] word and is being fulfilled through the
[1:19:06] lives of the believers here this
[1:19:08] evening. Now,
[1:19:11] I like this little thing here there in
[1:19:13] the message. Uh uh I got this one from
[1:19:16] the message Jehovah Gyra. It says Mr.
[1:19:18] Bosworth said he said I have 600
[1:19:21] statements. Now break this is just
[1:19:24] breaking into the situation where there
[1:19:26] there was a man that had challenged
[1:19:28] brother Random on divine healing and we
[1:19:30] all know the story there at the Houston
[1:19:32] Coliseum where where he was challenged
[1:19:34] by the newspapers and you know we know
[1:19:36] the story about how brother Random
[1:19:38] didn't want to uh debate over the word
[1:19:39] so brother Bosworth come and asked to be
[1:19:41] able to debate. Now, I want us to be
[1:19:43] able to think about this is because, you
[1:19:45] know, you know, there's a lot of
[1:19:46] different needs. There's a lot of
[1:19:48] different things that that that that
[1:19:49] that we desire that that that you know,
[1:19:52] we we begin to look and we begin to look
[1:19:55] at where where Jesus is and we can find
[1:19:57] that there's a lot of things that was in
[1:19:59] the Old Testament where Jehovah was. We
[1:20:02] we talk about Jehovah Rafa and you talk
[1:20:04] about Jehovah Nissi and you talk about
[1:20:06] Jehovah Zitkanu and you talk about you
[1:20:08] know Jehovah uh Gyra and you talk about
[1:20:10] these different ones but but the thing
[1:20:12] but the thing is is you find those
[1:20:14] things but now we need to be able to
[1:20:16] find where that relies today. Now, I
[1:20:19] love this bringing this in here because
[1:20:21] I felt like it kind of clarified it
[1:20:22] there. And this is brother Brandham or
[1:20:24] brother Bosworth in the debate here. And
[1:20:26] breaking into this debate here, it says,
[1:20:28] "Brother Bosworth said, he said, I have
[1:20:30] 600 statements concerning Christ's
[1:20:32] attitude towards the sick. I will place
[1:20:35] these to Mr. Best if he can take one of
[1:20:38] them and disprove it by the word. I'll
[1:20:40] turn this debate to him and he w and he
[1:20:42] wouldn't do it." He said, "Then I'll ask
[1:20:44] Mr. Best, the best Baptist preacher. I
[1:20:47] asked him one question. and if he'll
[1:20:49] answer it yes or no just say yes or no
[1:20:51] then I'll turn the rest of it over to
[1:20:53] him Mr. best said, "Ask on." The
[1:20:56] mediator gave him or gave him release.
[1:20:58] He said, "Was the redemptive names of
[1:21:01] Jehovah
[1:21:02] uh the seven compound redemptive names
[1:21:05] of Jehovah applied to Jesus?" Yes or no?
[1:21:09] That settled it. Now, did you get that?
[1:21:11] Did you see? He says, "Could you explain
[1:21:14] that again, brother?" He says, "He wants
[1:21:16] me to get it again so they would be so
[1:21:18] that would be sure." Was the redemptive
[1:21:21] names, the seven compoundtown redemptive
[1:21:23] names of Jehovah applied to Jesus? Yes
[1:21:26] or no? He couldn't say it. If he said
[1:21:28] yes, he was Jehovah Gyra, the Lord's
[1:21:31] provided sacrifice. And if he was
[1:21:34] Jehovah Gyra, then he was also Jehovah
[1:21:36] Rafa. Now listen, I want these ministers
[1:21:39] to catch this. You understand what it
[1:21:41] means? See Jehovah Gyra. You see, you
[1:21:44] know, he says Jehovah Gyra, Jehovah Rafa
[1:21:47] won all of you. Okay? Now, if he said
[1:21:50] that he wasn't Jehovah Gyra, he wasn't
[1:21:52] Jehovah Gyra, then he also if he wasn't
[1:21:56] he was Jehovah Gyra, then he had to
[1:21:58] become Jehovah Rafa. You can't separate
[1:22:00] them. See, you can't separate them. So,
[1:22:03] if he isn't Jehovah, Jehovah, our
[1:22:06] healer, he isn't Jehovah, our savior.
[1:22:08] That that settled it. He couldn't answer
[1:22:10] it. He couldn't answer it. Amen. Excuse
[1:22:13] me, brother. Then speaks to brother
[1:22:15] Brandham away from the microphone. Get
[1:22:17] it? You see, you can't deny one and
[1:22:19] accept the other. And if God has ever
[1:22:22] healed you once, he'll heal you again.
[1:22:24] And if God has ever has ever has ever uh
[1:22:27] uh uh been God's been mighty in battle
[1:22:29] for you and mighty in battle, then he
[1:22:32] can't help but be the healer. Amen. So,
[1:22:34] and and if God, Amen, he and if he was
[1:22:36] God, amen, the provider, then he he has
[1:22:39] no choice, amen, to be uh the uh the
[1:22:42] God, Amen, that health thee. Now, now
[1:22:45] thinking about this, I love the story
[1:22:46] about Isaac or Abraham. And Amen. I'm
[1:22:49] trying to wind this down and and and you
[1:22:51] just be patient with me here. It says,
[1:22:53] "Now he said unto his servants, the boys
[1:22:55] that was with him, listen to this." Now,
[1:22:58] he said, "You all tar here while the boy
[1:23:00] and I go up to worship."
[1:23:04] Now, I might have jumped a little bit
[1:23:06] ahead of myself in this, but
[1:23:09] at this phase
[1:23:12] in the Bible, at this phase,
[1:23:16] we were dealing with Jehovah and his
[1:23:19] redemptive abilities
[1:23:22] and his names of the seven names of
[1:23:24] redemption.
[1:23:26] You're dealing with you're dealing with
[1:23:28] you're dealing with all of the seven
[1:23:30] redemptive names. So this is where I
[1:23:32] wanting to bring this that now he said
[1:23:35] to the servants the boys that were with
[1:23:37] him listen to this now he said he said
[1:23:39] all tar here while the boy and I go up
[1:23:41] to worship the boy and I will return oh
[1:23:44] my what with a knife in his belt and in
[1:23:47] his heart to do the will of God
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; was going to kill his own son you wait
[1:23:53] there the boy and I are going up yonder
[1:23:56] to worship the boy and I will return how
[1:24:00] he knowed God would keep his word in
[1:24:02] some way.
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; On on they go up to the top of the
[1:24:07] mountain. Now watch when he got up to
[1:24:08] the mountain, he took all his wood and
[1:24:11] he laid it on Isaac's back. Wonder why
[1:24:13] he done all these things? Because it was
[1:24:16] a figure of Christ.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Isaac packed the wood up the hill that
[1:24:23] he himself was the sacrifice to lay on.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; See the parallel there? Christ packed up
[1:24:29] the cross to the hill where he the
[1:24:32] sacrifice was to be laid on. Abraham
[1:24:35] shadowed God and the father giving his
[1:24:38] only begotten son for our sins. Abraham
[1:24:42] was giving his only son for obedience to
[1:24:45] God. Now God as they go up the hill,
[1:24:48] Abraham packing the fire and when they
[1:24:51] had got up there, he said, "Father,"
[1:24:54] he said, "Here am I." He say, "Here is
[1:24:58] the wood and here is the fire.
[1:25:02] &gt;&gt; Here is the altar. But where is the lamb
[1:25:05] for sacrifice?
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Where is the lamb for sacrifice?
[1:25:16] Where
[1:25:18] is the need that needs to be provided
[1:25:21] for you?
[1:25:23] What is it that you're looking for?
[1:25:27] What is it that that you need God to do
[1:25:30] to move in your life?
[1:25:34] Wonder what or wonder why he or Abraham
[1:25:37] shadowed God and the father giving all
[1:25:39] his only begotten son for our sins.
[1:25:41] Abraham was giving his only son for the
[1:25:43] obedience to God. Now notice they go up
[1:25:45] the hill. Abraham packing the fire. When
[1:25:47] they go up to the fire, he said here, he
[1:25:49] said, "Here's the wood. Here's the fire.
[1:25:51] Here's the altar. But where's the lamb
[1:25:52] for sacrifice?" He says, "Oh, could you
[1:25:55] imagine the father's heart pumping hard,
[1:25:58] his only child?" He said, "Where is the
[1:26:00] sacrifice?" Abraham choking back the
[1:26:03] tears. Think of it of his own child
[1:26:05] choking back in the choking back the
[1:26:07] tears with the stern look towards
[1:26:08] heaven. He says, "My son,
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; this where your faith, man, starts
[1:26:13] kicking in.
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; This is where your faith is starting to
[1:26:17] look at the circumstance and you're not
[1:26:18] realizing what's going to exactly fix to
[1:26:20] happen. You don't realize how those
[1:26:22] bills are fixing to get paid. You don't
[1:26:23] realize how that how that God's going to
[1:26:25] heal your body. You don't realize how
[1:26:27] that what your your next move in life
[1:26:29] is. You don't realize, hey, man, that
[1:26:31] the the the the uh you you children that
[1:26:33] the things that you're going through in
[1:26:35] your life or where your emotions are
[1:26:36] moving back and forth and you're and
[1:26:38] you're beginning to struggle and you're
[1:26:39] beginning you don't know you don't know
[1:26:40] what what God's going to do to be able
[1:26:42] to be able to do for your life, but yet
[1:26:44] you're following the will of God.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:26:48] But yet you're but yet but yet you pack
[1:26:50] the wood up the mountain as God told you
[1:26:51] to do. But yet but yet you're you're
[1:26:54] doing everything that you can and it
[1:26:56] just seems like God's just going to cut
[1:26:57] you off. He says Abraham choking back
[1:27:00] his tears thinking of his own self
[1:27:01] choking back there the stern look
[1:27:03] towards heaven. He said my son God will
[1:27:05] provide himself a lamb for the
[1:27:08] sacrifice. He says I'm not much. He says
[1:27:11] I'm not emotional much but that's just
[1:27:13] gets me. He says God will provide
[1:27:17] himself a sacrifice or a lamb for the
[1:27:20] sacrifice. He said and he said turn
[1:27:23] around Isaac turn your back to me my
[1:27:25] son. Now think about this. Abraham had
[1:27:28] the promise
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; that his seed was going to multiply.
[1:27:33] That it was that his seed amen was going
[1:27:36] to be a royal nation. that his seed. So
[1:27:38] he had the promise but yet the situation
[1:27:40] was acting contrary towards the promise
[1:27:43] that God had given Abraham
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; and sometimes you're going through
[1:27:48] things you're going through life you're
[1:27:50] going through things in your life that
[1:27:51] seem to be contrary to the will that's
[1:27:54] contrary to what you feel like God's
[1:27:56] doing in your life it seems like why
[1:27:58] would God be doing all these things but
[1:28:00] yet Abraham knew in the back of his mind
[1:28:03] that's why he said or that's why I love
[1:28:04] where he talked about he said he choked
[1:28:06] up
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; and he stepped out because he knew that
[1:28:11] God had given him a promise.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; He knew and then in your life that God
[1:28:17] had given you a promise of healing. That
[1:28:19] God had given you a promise of your
[1:28:21] sound mind. That God had given you a
[1:28:23] promise of overcoming power in your
[1:28:25] life. That God had given you the
[1:28:27] ability, amen, to to destroy mind
[1:28:29] battles in your life. Amen. That God is
[1:28:32] going to provide a way, amen, for you to
[1:28:34] overcome.
[1:28:36] He says, "I'm I'm not emotional much,
[1:28:38] but here just gets me. God will provide
[1:28:40] himself a sacrifice or a lamb for the
[1:28:43] sacrifice." He said, "Turn around,
[1:28:44] Isaac. Turn your back to me, son." He
[1:28:48] did. And Isaac thought, "What's this?
[1:28:52] It's leather cord attacking my hands.
[1:28:55] It's getting close." Just like those
[1:28:58] Hebrew boys every walking up to that
[1:29:00] fire. That fire was getting hot. Isaac,
[1:29:03] he was the promise. And he was standing
[1:29:05] there with the leather being strapped
[1:29:07] around his back there and he his hands
[1:29:10] were being tied and and then all of a
[1:29:11] sudden he goes back he goes on to says
[1:29:14] and he says what's this? It's leather
[1:29:16] quartz taking my hand. Surely father
[1:29:18] understand what he's doing around his
[1:29:20] feet when some cords. Surely if God was
[1:29:23] going to provide something that he would
[1:29:24] have already done it by now. Surely if
[1:29:27] God was going to save my children.
[1:29:30] Surely if God was going to heal my body.
[1:29:32] Surely if God was going to was going to
[1:29:34] be able to provide for me in my family
[1:29:36] situation. Surely if God was going to be
[1:29:39] able to deliver me from this infirmity
[1:29:41] or deliver me from this spiritual battle
[1:29:43] that he was going to do it by now.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; But God was putting that faith to the
[1:29:50] test.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; He had realized that that that he had
[1:29:54] given amen him a promise and he was
[1:29:56] wanting to see if that faith would be
[1:29:57] willing to be put to the test.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; He said and he did. And Isaac thought,
[1:30:02] "Was this a leather cord? Surely, surely
[1:30:05] the father Isaac, what's he doing around
[1:30:06] his feet when some cords tied them
[1:30:08] together?" He looked over. Abraham
[1:30:11] looked at him, brushed back the hair out
[1:30:12] of his eyes, kissed him on the cheek.
[1:30:15] God be with you, my son. Laid him upon
[1:30:17] the altar, looked back, choking back his
[1:30:19] tears, his little tears, obedient to
[1:30:21] death, not asking the question.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; I sit back and whining. I sit back and
[1:30:30] whining to somebody about all the things
[1:30:33] that you're going through. I sit back
[1:30:36] and saying, "Oh, I got this." Or, "Oh, I
[1:30:38] got that." It wasn't that that was kept
[1:30:40] in mind. Abraham had to keep his mind on
[1:30:42] a promise. Amen. That no matter what,
[1:30:44] that he was going to have to kill the
[1:30:46] very thing that God gave him. But yet he
[1:30:48] had to realize, amen, that even if he
[1:30:50] got slew, he would have to have enough
[1:30:52] faith or or God would or God would give
[1:30:55] have the ability to raise him up again.
[1:30:57] And sometimes right at the crucial
[1:30:59] moment, he could have moved.
[1:31:02] He could have ran. He could have said,
[1:31:04] "No, this is my son."
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; He said, "No, this situation could have
[1:31:10] been too hot."
[1:31:14] Little Isaac obedient, not asking a
[1:31:17] question. Abraham pulled back his big
[1:31:18] knife from that that sheath, the knife
[1:31:21] from his sheath, and he brushed back his
[1:31:24] hair from his little neck and he looked
[1:31:25] up to God and he started to take his
[1:31:27] little his little he started to take the
[1:31:29] life of his own son
[1:31:32] just as he raised his hand.
[1:31:37] The Holy Ghost caught his hand and
[1:31:40] said,"Abraham, say your hand, for I know
[1:31:44] now that you love me.
[1:31:48] not even to spare your oh son
[1:31:56] that God in the midst of your trial that
[1:31:58] you're willing to serve me
[1:32:01] when the fire gets heavy when it seems
[1:32:04] that I'm going to lose
[1:32:06] everything that I have. When it seems
[1:32:09] that
[1:32:11] life, my life is falling apart and it
[1:32:13] seems that I had to come and all of a
[1:32:15] sudden God keeps his word and at the
[1:32:18] very last moment his holy spirit comes
[1:32:20] in and says, "Now I know." And it wasn't
[1:32:24] on the mountaintop. But it was at that
[1:32:26] very moment when it seems to be all lost
[1:32:28] that God came in at that moment and he
[1:32:30] says, "Now I know that you love me.
[1:32:40] Holy Ghost caught his hand. He said,
[1:32:41] "Stay your hand, for now I know that you
[1:32:44] love me,
[1:32:46] not even sparing your own son." Could
[1:32:49] you think about that as your only child
[1:32:51] and you had waited all those years?
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Abraham had been faithful for 25 years.
[1:32:58] Abraham stood and he wandered and he
[1:33:00] looked for a place whose city is baker,
[1:33:02] builder, and maker is God. He could have
[1:33:04] drew the line with God at that moment
[1:33:06] right there and said, "Lord, I can't
[1:33:07] follow you no further."
[1:33:13] But God just wasn't something that he
[1:33:15] did on Sunday.
[1:33:17] God wasn't just something that he did on
[1:33:19] Wednesday. God wasn't just something
[1:33:22] that he did at church camp or that he
[1:33:23] did at revival meeting, but it was his
[1:33:25] everyday life.
[1:33:28] and he was willing to sacrifice
[1:33:30] anything.
[1:33:33] And all of a sudden, you're going
[1:33:34] through this trial and you're looking
[1:33:36] all a sudden he stays his hand and he
[1:33:38] says, "And about that time, oh God,
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; bless the Lord,
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; a bleeding little ram,
[1:33:48] not a not a female.
[1:33:51] I knew a ram was caught in the
[1:33:53] wilderness by his horns." What was it?
[1:33:56] It was Jehovah.
[1:33:58] that provided a lamb. As our musicians
[1:34:01] come
[1:34:04] right in the middle when the heat was
[1:34:07] there
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; and you're looking and you're standing
[1:34:10] and all of a sudden,
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; oh Jesus,
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; you feel the heat of the situation going
[1:34:14] on in your life, fill in the blank of
[1:34:16] where it's at. I don't know. All I'm
[1:34:19] doing is just being put here. what's on
[1:34:20] our heart here this evening that at that
[1:34:23] moment
[1:34:26] when you're hanging in there and it's
[1:34:29] it's all turbulent
[1:34:31] when it seems like this or that or this
[1:34:34] or that or this or that is all taking
[1:34:36] place
[1:34:38] and it seems like that this is it.
[1:34:41] My spiritual life, physical life is
[1:34:43] coming to the guillotine. They've got me
[1:34:45] wrapped in my arms. They got me wrapped
[1:34:47] in my legs. a dud in.
[1:34:54] It didn't say that somebody from the bo
[1:34:56] the bottom of the hill seen him and all
[1:34:58] of a sudden rushed up there to stop him.
[1:34:59] It said God stood his hand. The Holy
[1:35:01] Ghost stood his hand. He says, "Now I
[1:35:04] know that you love me."
[1:35:10] Sometimes
[1:35:12] we don't expect to sacrifice.
[1:35:15] We don't expect to get rid of things in
[1:35:17] our life,
[1:35:21] but we expect God to go daily to the
[1:35:24] cross
[1:35:26] and die over and over and over and over.
[1:35:32] He sacrificed
[1:35:34] his life.
[1:35:37] He sacrificed. He made
[1:35:42] provisions.
[1:35:43] He was Jehovah Gyra. He was Jehovah
[1:35:47] Nissi. He was Jehovah Zitkanu. He was He
[1:35:49] was He was your God before you were even
[1:35:52] thought of. He prepared every situation
[1:35:54] for you to be able to get out of when
[1:35:56] you were in need. Before you were even
[1:35:58] born, God made sure that you had a way
[1:36:00] out. Before sin ever came, before your
[1:36:02] situation had ever given
[1:36:05] [Music]
[1:36:14] And here this evening,
[1:36:19] [Music]
[1:36:23] God's not at the center.
[1:36:33] If God's not at your center, and it's
[1:36:35] easy to happen, you got a lot of things
[1:36:38] going on, every one of us.
[1:36:42] But God's brought you this far.
[1:36:47] God's brought you this far. And not to
[1:36:50] just be one of those that are counted
[1:36:51] off of the wayside, oh yes, Mike King,
[1:36:54] he served God for a long time, and all
[1:36:56] of a sudden he just wear it off. No.
[1:36:59] All that my father have given me
[1:37:06] and he will not lose a one.
[1:37:13] He's here here this evening.
[1:37:16] He's here here this evening.
[1:37:19] All you need to do is just go.
[1:37:24] If you're dealing with mind battles here
[1:37:27] this evening, if you're dealing with
[1:37:28] certain elements, whatever it is that
[1:37:30] you might be dealing with, run to Jesus.
[1:37:35] Find him in his word because that's
[1:37:37] where he's expressed that here today.
[1:37:41] You could find him in the scriptures.
[1:37:44] You could find him here, a restored word
[1:37:47] where you could read in between the
[1:37:49] lines and you could find him living and
[1:37:51] breathing and speaking to you.
[1:37:54] If you need him to be the provider, he's
[1:37:56] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:38:00] If he provided Jehovah in the old
[1:38:05] and he provided as Jesus
[1:38:09] of the New Testament,
[1:38:12] then he will provide today
[1:38:14] because Jesus is in his word
[1:38:18] and you read that word and that word
[1:38:21] could be expressed and you could find
[1:38:23] his attributes being shown to you, his
[1:38:26] mercy to be shown for you.
[1:38:29] If you've fallen short, don't let the
[1:38:31] devil tell you.
[1:38:35] Don't let him tell you that you're too
[1:38:37] unworthy to come into his presence
[1:38:39] because you're not.
[1:38:44] If you're struggling
[1:38:48] because you don't know what to do in a
[1:38:49] situation.
[1:38:52] You might be in a barnia situation here
[1:38:54] and you don't know which way to go, left
[1:38:56] or right.
[1:38:59] Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
[1:39:01] these things will be added unto you.
[1:39:04] Seek him while he be found here here
[1:39:06] this evening.
[1:39:10] He's your provider. He's all you need
[1:39:13] here here this evening.
[1:39:15] Kobe, what are we singing?
[1:39:19] You
[1:39:21] made a way
[1:39:27] when our backs were against the wall
[1:39:31] and it looked as if it was over.
[1:39:36] You
[1:39:38] made a way.
[1:39:44] And we're standing here
[1:39:48] only because you've made
[1:39:52] a way.
[1:39:56] Oh, you can move mountains.
[1:40:00] You can cause walls to fall
[1:40:04] with your power.
[1:40:08] You perform miracles
[1:40:12] and there's nothing
[1:40:17] that's impossible.
[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:20] [Applause]
[1:40:21] And we're standing here
[1:40:25] only because you fade
[1:40:29] away.
[1:40:33] Oh, you
[1:40:36] made a way.
[1:40:42] When our backs were against the wall
[1:40:46] and it looked as if it was over,
[1:40:50] you
[1:40:53] lay a way.
[1:40:58] And we're standing here
[1:41:02] only because you made
[1:41:07] a way.
[1:41:08] [Music]
[1:41:11] I need you, Lord.
[1:41:15] I need you, Lord.
[1:41:19] Right now.
[1:41:23] Let's just stand to our feet here this
[1:41:25] evening as we get ready to turn our
[1:41:27] service over. I need you, Lord.
[1:41:32] I need you, Lord,
[1:41:36] right now.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; You need him here this evening.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; We need a lot of things in life.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; I lift my head.
[1:41:48] I bow my knee. We don't
[1:41:53] worship.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Don't leave the flower in the mountain.
[1:41:58] [Music]
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; I need
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; Don't leave the flower in the mountain.

[1:54:43] [Applause]
[1:54:45] Wonderful,
[1:54:46] [Music]
[1:54:48] wonderful message here this evening.
[1:54:51] He is all that we have need of.
[1:54:55] Just Amen. Just
[1:54:59] line up everything that you have and all
[1:55:02] of the all of the needs that you have.
[1:55:06] Amen. And as
[1:55:09] brother Michael said, it'll funnel down
[1:55:11] all down to one common denominator.
[1:55:16] We need the Lord Jesus.
[1:55:19] And that word, it all comes right down
[1:55:22] to his word. Are we willing
[1:55:25] to sacrifice
[1:55:28] our feelings, our sickness, our mind
[1:55:32] battles? Are we are we are we able are
[1:55:34] we willing to
[1:55:37] lay it all right down there on as as
[1:55:39] Abraham did? Because really that was
[1:55:44] that was he he had went for 25 years
[1:55:46] waiting for that promise. And now here
[1:55:49] he is 14 15 years later.
[1:55:54] And so now we're we're we're talking
[1:55:56] about between uh 35 40 years
[1:56:01] later
[1:56:03] since he's had the promise.
[1:56:07] Amen. He's had the boy now for 14 15
[1:56:10] years. God's saying to sacrifice him and
[1:56:13] and and he's got to lay it down. on.
[1:56:16] He's got to lay that child down, lay
[1:56:18] that promise down for the will of God.
[1:56:21] And I really think that's that's
[1:56:23] something that God is asking of us. And
[1:56:26] sometimes we we'll go through a
[1:56:28] prolonged sickness or we'll go through a
[1:56:30] prolonged whatever in our lives, our
[1:56:32] children or this, that, and the other.
[1:56:34] And a and a lot of it, it's not our
[1:56:36] children's, it is our children's battle,
[1:56:38] but it's our battle as a parent. It's
[1:56:41] what God is, where are we going to where
[1:56:43] are we at? where what are we willing to
[1:56:45] to come to in ourselves, Lord, what are
[1:56:48] you trying to teach me? Where am I at in
[1:56:52] our sicknesses? Sometimes we ask and and
[1:56:55] we don't we don't get that immediate
[1:56:57] response from the Lord like we want that
[1:56:59] healing like we're asking for and the
[1:57:02] Lord's want to do something deeper
[1:57:04] inside us. Where where are we at? What
[1:57:07] are are we willing to throw aside his
[1:57:09] his his promises for feelings and
[1:57:12] emotions and this that and the other?
[1:57:15] Are we willing to stand there in faith?
[1:57:17] And God God does these things. He allows
[1:57:20] He allows things where man uh
[1:57:25] a spousal problem or this that and the
[1:57:28] other. Are we willing to stand upon the
[1:57:32] word of God by ourselves?
[1:57:35] stand upon and commit ourselves to that
[1:57:38] word alone.
[1:57:40] Are we so in love with him? Not just
[1:57:44] saying it from our lips. We can say that
[1:57:46] we're in love with him, but yet we're
[1:57:48] we're we're we're allowing our mind to
[1:57:51] feed on this and that and every
[1:57:53] imagination. Well, we're listen, we're
[1:57:56] not in love with him. Amen. That's
[1:57:58] actually in scriptural terms committing
[1:58:01] adultery against his word because we're
[1:58:03] not putting his word as our absolute.
[1:58:06] We're chasing this and that and the
[1:58:08] other. God don't want that. God doesn't.
[1:58:11] No other opinion matters. No other
[1:58:14] emotion matters. Nothing else matters
[1:58:17] but God and his word.
[1:58:21] And when you're in the fire,
[1:58:24] hallelujah. When you're in that when
[1:58:25] when God's allowing the pressure to be
[1:58:27] put on you, you are you you're
[1:58:30] squirming. But when it all comes down to
[1:58:32] it, the bedrock is though God slay me,
[1:58:37] yet I will serve him. Is that right? And
[1:58:41] then God says, then God says, I I've got
[1:58:45] confidence. And and the thing is is God
[1:58:48] always did have confidence in Job. Amen.
[1:58:52] But God wanted Job to see something
[1:58:54] within him. And when all of it was said
[1:58:57] and done, amen. He was able to say, "God
[1:59:01] gives and God takes away. Blessed be the
[1:59:04] name of the Lord." Is that right? So
[1:59:06] when you're if you're sick here tonight,
[1:59:09] keep that confession. Lord, I I'm I'm
[1:59:12] going to serve you. You You are my
[1:59:14] healer. And if you haven't done it
[1:59:16] already, then there's a reason. You're
[1:59:18] testing my faith. And I just want you to
[1:59:20] know I've still got my faith. If you're
[1:59:22] believing for your children, Amen. I
[1:59:25] Lord, I listen, it is ju it just a snap
[1:59:28] of the finger and you could you could do
[1:59:30] that. But you're working something in
[1:59:31] them and you're working something in me.
[1:59:34] Is that right? Amen. Whether it be your
[1:59:36] your your your husband, your wife, your
[1:59:39] your your family situation,
[1:59:42] when it comes down to it, God, I will
[1:59:45] serve you alone. If I have to serve you,
[1:59:49] I will believe you though you slay me. I
[1:59:53] will give everything I've got to you.
[1:59:57] Amen. You are all I need. I don't need
[2:00:01] you plus uh her or plus my son or plus
[2:00:04] my healing. I don't need you plus my my
[2:00:07] my wife or my husband. I need you alone.
[2:00:13] I'm going to serve you alone.
[2:00:17] And then God adds everything else to us.
[2:00:21] Then God does that. Can you say amen?
[2:00:24] Did you enjoy the word of the Lord
[2:00:25] tonight? I enjoyed Brother
[2:00:28] Michael's message here this evening.
[2:00:32] Amen.

[2:00:36] I want. Amen. God bless you.

[2:07:23] to Calvary
[2:07:25] to the crimson flow.
[2:07:29] Many arrows pierce my soul from
[2:07:32] withoutin.
[2:07:34] [Applause]
[2:07:36] But my Lord leads me on and through him
[2:07:40] I all together now as we dismiss. Oh I
[2:07:44] want to see him
[2:07:48] stay
[2:07:50] there to sing. You're dismissed in the
[2:07:52] fear of the Lord. Make sure you shake
[2:07:54] one another's hands as you're
[2:07:56] dismissing. We love you. Glory.
[2:08:00] Let me lift my voice. All of my cares
[2:08:04] are passed. Home at last, ever too.
[2:08:11] In service for my Lord. Dark may be the
[2:08:16] night,
[2:08:18] but I'll cling more close to him.
[2:08:21] Through him light.
[2:08:25] Satan snares may vex my soul from
[2:08:32] but my Lord goes ahead leads what every
[2:08:37] time.
[2:08:38] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[2:08:44] face.
[2:08:46] There to see forever
[2:08:49] heart
[2:08:53] on the streets of glory.
[2:08:57] Let me lift my voice over my cares.
[2:09:02] Oh, at last ever to rejoice.
[2:09:07] And oh, I want to see him.
