[1:02:17] I've never gone before
[1:02:23] that I fulfilled
[1:02:25] the purpose.
[1:02:28] [Music]
[1:02:29] I was sent to earth for
[1:02:36] oh
[1:02:37] I heard
[1:02:39] an eagle scream
[1:02:43] as she soared on the wind
[1:02:49] soaring higher
[1:02:52] and higher on outstretched
[1:02:57] wings.
[1:02:57] [Music]
[1:03:00] You know, it was then I realized
[1:03:07] that I belonged
[1:03:10] in those same heights. If I could only
[1:03:16] gain the string
[1:03:19] that I need.
[1:03:25] May I be renewed
[1:03:30] [Music]
[1:03:31] as an eagle to its you.
[1:03:37] Oh may my eyes be fixed on heaven
[1:03:45] till this world just fades from view.
[1:03:52] Lord, take me places
[1:03:57] [Music]
[1:03:59] I've never gone before
[1:04:03] [Music]
[1:04:04] that I fulfilled
[1:04:07] the purpose.
[1:04:09] [Music]
[1:04:11] I was sent to earth for.
[1:04:17] Oh, I heard
[1:04:20] an eagle
[1:04:22] string
[1:04:24] as she soared on the wind.
[1:04:30] Oh, she was soaring higher
[1:04:33] and higher on outstretched wings.
[1:04:41] Oh, you know it was there. I realized
[1:04:47] that I belong
[1:04:50] in those same heights. If I could only
[1:04:56] gain the strength
[1:04:59] that I need.
[1:05:04] May I be renewed
[1:05:08] [Music]
[1:05:11] as an eagle to it.
[1:05:17] Oh, may my eyes be fixed on heaven
[1:05:24] till this world just fades from you.
[1:05:32] Lord, take me places
[1:05:39] I've never gone before
[1:05:44] that I fulfilled
[1:05:46] the purpose.
[1:05:49] [Music]
[1:05:50] I was sent to work for
[1:05:55] all that I fulfilled
[1:05:59] the purpose
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:03] I was sent to work for.
[1:06:11] Hallelujah.
[1:06:12] [Applause]
[1:06:17] Aren't you God? Aren't you glad that God
[1:06:20] has got a place of refreshing and a cave
[1:06:24] somewhere that we can get away with the
[1:06:25] Lord and and just get a renewing?
[1:06:29] And I believe that uh God's got a place
[1:06:32] for every Christian uh to renew
[1:06:35] themselves and the power of his might
[1:06:37] and and uh to get, you know, just to get
[1:06:42] fresh growth and fresh feathers and uh
[1:06:45] just uh to get get renewed in the Holy
[1:06:48] Spirit and soar back into the heavenlies
[1:06:50] and and uh there was a promise of that
[1:06:53] in this age. and he promised times and
[1:06:56] season of refreshing and and uh I'm so
[1:06:59] glad that we're living in that in that
[1:07:01] time. Amen. And uh maybe the boys will
[1:07:05] get a a song or something for this
[1:07:07] evening. Uh Nita
[1:07:10] they they
[1:07:13] uh I I think it was their sister that
[1:07:15] always kind of cracked a whip to get
[1:07:18] them to to sing. And uh so uh but but
[1:07:22] maybe they'll get something uh for this
[1:07:24] evening. And but uh if you have your
[1:07:27] Bibles
[1:07:30] uh 1 John the 5th chapter
[1:07:34] the 4th verse and we're just going to
[1:07:38] read one portion of scripture.
[1:07:46] We're so glad uh
[1:07:49] brother Donald that God seen you through
[1:07:52] that surgery and and uh we just a lot of
[1:07:57] lot of prayers going your direction. We
[1:07:59] sure we're sure love you. You know, I
[1:08:01] was thinking back uh I was telling my
[1:08:04] wife the other day, I I said, you know,
[1:08:07] Brother Donald,
[1:08:09] I before I even uh considered myself a
[1:08:13] preacher, just a kid. Uh but uh brother
[1:08:16] Donald was very kind and patient and uh
[1:08:19] I I remember just being maybe a
[1:08:21] 15year-old boy uh sitting down and and
[1:08:25] talking with brother Donald and we had
[1:08:27] talk about the things of the Lord and I
[1:08:29] would tell him all of my you know all of
[1:08:31] my revelations and how the Lord was uh
[1:08:35] dealing with me and he would sit there
[1:08:38] and so kind and patience and patient and
[1:08:42] as if it was just the greatest thing and
[1:08:45] and so uh brother Donald's always had a
[1:08:48] real special place in my heart and love
[1:08:51] him very much and and he and aunt Angie
[1:08:55] uh seen God do some great things and in
[1:08:57] their lives and and uh so just very very
[1:09:02] appreciative love them and uh so first
[1:09:05] John the 5th chapter the fourth verse
[1:09:09] for whatsoever is born of God overcometh
[1:09:14] the world. And this is the victory that
[1:09:18] overcomemeth the world, even our faith.
[1:09:21] And I would like to uh just take a text
[1:09:24] from this and make it personal that this
[1:09:27] is uh the victory. This is our victory
[1:09:31] that overcomemeth the world, even our
[1:09:34] faith. This is our victory. Even our
[1:09:38] faith. And let's just bow our hearts in
[1:09:41] a word of prayer.
[1:09:43] Maybe you'd like to be remembered this
[1:09:45] morning. And if you want to just lift
[1:09:48] your hand, you're welcome to. Heavenly
[1:09:50] Father, we we identify as your children.
[1:09:56] Lord, we've experienced your love and
[1:09:58] the visitation of your Holy Spirit upon
[1:10:01] our lives. What a work you have wrought
[1:10:04] in our lives, Lord. The change that has
[1:10:07] taken place. And Lord, the change in
[1:10:10] direction, the change in thought, the
[1:10:13] change in desire. Lord, we can't thank
[1:10:16] you enough. We can't worship you enough,
[1:10:19] Father. There's not enough songs that we
[1:10:21] could sing to express our appreciation
[1:10:25] how far you've brought us and where
[1:10:27] you're taking us. And Lord, just to be
[1:10:30] able to follow your leadership in this
[1:10:32] age and realizing that we're in the the
[1:10:36] greatest of ages, the greatest of ours.
[1:10:38] This is an exodus that you're leading us
[1:10:41] into all the promises of God and a real
[1:10:44] rapture and translation and waiting for
[1:10:47] the change of our bodies. I ask, Father,
[1:10:50] that you would minister to your
[1:10:51] children. That you would bless them.
[1:10:54] Father, you see their hearts. you see
[1:10:56] the needs under the hands and I pray God
[1:11:00] that you would strengthen them and and
[1:11:02] visit them this morning and just give
[1:11:04] them a real a fresh dose of that
[1:11:07] refreshment. We would ask Lord in the
[1:11:10] name of Jesus Christ. Amen and amen. God
[1:11:14] richly bless you. You can be seated uh
[1:11:18] just reading
[1:11:20] uh this portion of scripture out of 1
[1:11:23] John the 5th chapter and the fourth
[1:11:25] verse and that this is the victory that
[1:11:28] overcometh the world even our faith and
[1:11:32] I've been uh listening to the sermon
[1:11:35] that brother Brandham preached along uh
[1:11:38] taking this uh text from this scripture
[1:11:41] that faith is our victory and uh brother
[1:11:44] Brandon would begin to show uh that
[1:11:48] there was different men throughout
[1:11:50] history uh such as uh Alexander the
[1:11:54] Great and uh Napoleon and when Hitler
[1:11:58] conquered uh France and and uh how that
[1:12:03] there was uh men in uh who who brought
[1:12:08] great victories and uh to to their
[1:12:11] nation and things and and yet we find
[1:12:15] that uh victory of that sort uh that
[1:12:19] type don't last. Uh and he says the
[1:12:23] reason for it is because it's not
[1:12:25] wrought right. Says you can never get
[1:12:27] good out of wrong. You've got to play
[1:12:30] the rule of the game fair. And and he
[1:12:33] would begin to talk about the Olympics
[1:12:35] or any other athletical exercises. says,
[1:12:39] "No matter if you arrive first in the
[1:12:42] race, but if you haven't played the game
[1:12:44] right, uh according to the rules, you're
[1:12:48] disqualified." He says, "You have to
[1:12:50] play the rule right." And then he would
[1:12:53] say, "That's the way it is with human
[1:12:56] life. You can't play the rules of the
[1:12:58] game of life wrong and expect to win.
[1:13:01] You've got to play it according to God's
[1:13:03] word and the purpose that you're that
[1:13:06] you were brought here for." He says
[1:13:08] there are so many people that doesn't
[1:13:10] seem to have any kind of a purpose in
[1:13:13] life and he would you know show that it
[1:13:17] seems like people uh their ambition is
[1:13:21] just uh it's a worldly ambition and it's
[1:13:25] just uh maybe to get a a better job to
[1:13:28] get a better car to get some more money
[1:13:31] in the bank and and uh the the ambition
[1:13:35] is to keep up with uh the world and to
[1:13:39] keep up with what's going on. What is
[1:13:41] the fashions? What what what uh what is
[1:13:46] uh something that uh is is uh present
[1:13:51] tense kind of I guess you would say uh
[1:13:53] what is fashionable, what the world
[1:13:56] likes and those things. He says but
[1:13:58] there's more to uh to ambition than
[1:14:02] that. uh the there's more uh our
[1:14:06] ambition should be more than just trying
[1:14:08] to uh fit in with the world or uh you
[1:14:13] know the fashions of the world. Uh he he
[1:14:16] would say that we've got to be more than
[1:14:18] just like a floater. He says it's like
[1:14:21] uh driftwood that is just going down uh
[1:14:25] you know the stream of life and and just
[1:14:28] floating just uh doesn't know where the
[1:14:31] stream is going to take you. Just
[1:14:33] floating and uh maybe go from this side
[1:14:37] of the bank to that side of the bank and
[1:14:39] nowhere no no no purpose no ambition
[1:14:44] just uh really doesn't know where you're
[1:14:47] going to end up in life. And and but
[1:14:50] brother Brandon begins to show that uh
[1:14:53] that if you give your life to Jesus
[1:14:56] Christ and who is the master uh
[1:15:00] craftsman, he he's the one that can take
[1:15:04] that same material uh that same log
[1:15:07] that's just floating down uh the stream
[1:15:10] of life. But someone with an
[1:15:13] intelligence can look and say, you know,
[1:15:16] I can make something out of that. and
[1:15:19] and then in the hands of that craftsman,
[1:15:22] he can begin to build a boat and put a
[1:15:25] motor on that boat and begin to give it
[1:15:28] direction and give it purpose and and
[1:15:30] and and show that there's an ambition
[1:15:34] about it. and he would, you know, he
[1:15:36] says you've you you've got to meet him
[1:15:39] as a masterpiece that he has worked on
[1:15:42] or a floating piece of driftwood to go
[1:15:46] into your final destination. So don't
[1:15:49] you use this life just to drift around
[1:15:53] and float around and get a better job
[1:15:55] and to dress better and and you know get
[1:15:58] a new television or a better car. Life
[1:16:01] means more than that. We find that we're
[1:16:06] just only passing through this life and
[1:16:09] and uh all of these other things that
[1:16:12] people can spend a a lifetime achieving
[1:16:15] great rewards and achieving great wealth
[1:16:19] and yet they're not going to take it
[1:16:20] with them. But the only thing that that
[1:16:24] really is going to satisfy the longing
[1:16:27] and desire of the human heart is Jesus
[1:16:31] Christ. So many are dissatisfied in
[1:16:35] life. So many are racing through life
[1:16:38] trying to get places and then they get
[1:16:40] there and then they're just as
[1:16:43] dissatisfied as they were when they were
[1:16:45] trying to get there. But they thought
[1:16:47] that getting maybe a certain job or
[1:16:50] getting a certain car would bring us
[1:16:52] satisfaction.
[1:16:54] And but we find that the the reason the
[1:16:57] world is so dissatisfied today is
[1:17:01] because they're failing to find that
[1:17:04] real satisfaction in Jesus Christ. And
[1:17:07] and so you know it seems even Christians
[1:17:11] are so dissatisfied with life and it's
[1:17:15] because disappointments come up and
[1:17:18] maybe their dreams uh become derailed
[1:17:22] and maybe home uh something comes along
[1:17:25] in their home life or maybe they be
[1:17:28] there's always looking out trying it's
[1:17:32] just that that real dream or that real
[1:17:35] something that they desire. is just
[1:17:37] always out of reach. But you see what
[1:17:41] God is wanting to satisfy the longing of
[1:17:45] our hearts is himself. Amen. He wants to
[1:17:50] be our portion. He wants to satisfy
[1:17:53] every every family. You know, there's
[1:17:56] there's rich people. There's poor
[1:17:59] people. And and there's rich people that
[1:18:02] are absolute god-fearing Christians. And
[1:18:05] then there's people that will never
[1:18:06] achieve that. But but that's not what
[1:18:10] we're looking at. What we're looking at
[1:18:12] is that Christ is the answer for every
[1:18:15] every home, every marriage, every boy,
[1:18:19] every girl. Christ is the one that can
[1:18:23] settle every heart. Don't be just a
[1:18:27] floater. Don't don't allow your faith
[1:18:30] just to float from one thing to another.
[1:18:33] and and then maybe you get disappointed
[1:18:36] and and and and then you think, well,
[1:18:38] does God love me? And and and does God
[1:18:42] really care for me? And and uh you know,
[1:18:45] and then we start looking at life as a
[1:18:47] failure. But but you see, our ambition
[1:18:51] has got to be more than that. Our
[1:18:54] ambition has got to be get a hold of
[1:18:57] Christ and never let him go. Hold on to
[1:19:00] the one who's called you and chosen you
[1:19:03] and called you out of the world. Called
[1:19:06] you out of just creeds and traditions
[1:19:09] and brought you to a real relationship
[1:19:12] with himself through the power of
[1:19:14] redemption. Because you see, that's the
[1:19:17] reason that God gave his life, shed his
[1:19:19] blood, is because he wants fellowship
[1:19:22] with us. Amen. And so God is God wants
[1:19:27] to make something of our life. And you
[1:19:30] know there the prophet of God would say
[1:19:32] there's not enough spirit touch in a in
[1:19:35] a meeting. He says you know we're we're
[1:19:39] getting people to church but we got to
[1:19:42] get them to Christ. There there's got to
[1:19:44] be more than just a good sermon. There's
[1:19:46] got to be more than just good song
[1:19:48] service. There's got to be more than
[1:19:50] just sitting on a message pew and saying
[1:19:53] God sent to a prophet and hearing even
[1:19:55] the great truths of the word. But we've
[1:19:58] got to have that real spirit touch of
[1:20:01] the move of the Holy Ghost in our lives
[1:20:04] to make the word effective in every
[1:20:06] heart to activate our faith. And our
[1:20:09] faith can take a hold of the promises of
[1:20:11] God and call those things that be not as
[1:20:14] though they are. and and and instead of
[1:20:16] just satisfied life, see the joy, the
[1:20:19] fruit of joy and the fruit of peace and
[1:20:22] the fruit of real longsuffering and
[1:20:26] patience and godliness and happiness and
[1:20:29] the Holy Ghost coming and blossoming in
[1:20:31] our life and we've got too many, you
[1:20:34] know, pro uh retractive meetings where
[1:20:37] we're just coming to church on a Sunday
[1:20:38] and we go out the door just like we came
[1:20:41] in. But we've got we we are in the
[1:20:43] greatest move and the greatest
[1:20:45] manifestation of the power of God the
[1:20:48] world has ever known. And we've got to
[1:20:51] treat this every day, every every second
[1:20:54] of our life that we are in an exodus.
[1:20:57] And God is leading us to the power of
[1:21:01] our the change of our bodies. Amen. And
[1:21:05] we've we've got to treat life more amen
[1:21:08] than just uh you know a happy happy
[1:21:11] golucky just just common just just you
[1:21:15] know just an ordinary thing. But let's
[1:21:18] just say what I believe that the prophet
[1:21:20] said it that we we are we are having we
[1:21:24] are we are a a natural being but we are
[1:21:27] we we are an eternal being in a physical
[1:21:31] time body but we are having a
[1:21:34] supernatural experience with almighty
[1:21:37] God. Amen. You see the prophet would say
[1:21:41] that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:43] It's it's the father again. God the
[1:21:46] Father dwelling in you, working out his
[1:21:48] plans to finish his plan of redemption,
[1:21:52] working through you, making you a
[1:21:55] coworker with him, giving you a place,
[1:21:58] giving you a part for your fallen lost
[1:22:01] brother and sister, giving you his
[1:22:04] spirit and his love to go hunt the lost
[1:22:08] as he did in the Garden of Eden. Adam,
[1:22:10] Adam, where art thou? That's what the
[1:22:13] Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman.
[1:22:16] When it strikes into their heart and
[1:22:18] takes its abode, there's a thirst and a
[1:22:20] hungering for lost souls. That's what's
[1:22:22] the matter with the meetings today.
[1:22:24] There is not enough spirit touch in it
[1:22:28] to go for the souls of the lost and
[1:22:31] dying. Amen. You see, the prophet of God
[1:22:34] was saying in another way that there's
[1:22:36] got to be spirit worship. Amen. Not just
[1:22:39] a stagnated worship, but a real faith.
[1:22:44] Amen. A real living worship. Worship is
[1:22:48] more than just lifting your hands. And
[1:22:52] it's more than just singing songs. But
[1:22:55] worship is life. Amen. Worship is an
[1:22:59] everyday
[1:23:01] life that the Holy Ghost is is just
[1:23:05] manifesting, radiating light through our
[1:23:08] life. Written epistles manifesting the
[1:23:12] word for this age. Uh that he's not a
[1:23:15] dead God, but he's a living God. He's a
[1:23:18] God that can change lives. He's a God
[1:23:20] that can bring peace to the hurting
[1:23:22] heart. He's a God, amen, that can take
[1:23:25] the worst of the worst of the worst
[1:23:27] situations
[1:23:29] and transform that out of hopelessness
[1:23:32] and decay into something that has been
[1:23:35] transformed into the very likeness of
[1:23:38] God. That's who we are. That's the faith
[1:23:41] that is overcoming the world uh not just
[1:23:44] limping along through life.
[1:23:47] not just always sing of the blues. Uh,
[1:23:50] but this song of the blues should be
[1:23:52] done away with and we should replace it
[1:23:55] with the song of the redeemed that I
[1:23:58] once was lost but now I'm found. I was
[1:24:02] blind but now I see. I've got a
[1:24:05] testimony that I once was one way and
[1:24:08] now I'm another way. That is the real
[1:24:10] spirit worship. Spirit worship. a spirit
[1:24:15] touch of the Holy Ghost that can come
[1:24:18] from our life to another life and bring
[1:24:21] such a power that can change a lost
[1:24:26] soul.
[1:24:28] You see, it's got to be a genuine spirit
[1:24:32] worship with Christ among us, living his
[1:24:35] life the way that he wants to among us.
[1:24:39] You see the Bible says that we are more
[1:24:43] than conquerors through Christ Jesus.
[1:24:46] Hallelujah.
[1:24:47] Amen. I think it was Ali and uh quite
[1:24:51] frankly I heard uh brother Michael
[1:24:54] speaking of him him and Sister Amy. He
[1:24:58] says that uh he's a conqueror but Sister
[1:25:01] Amy's more than a conqueror.
[1:25:05] I think he was saying, "Sister Amy, you
[1:25:07] get to spend his money." Something of
[1:25:08] that nature. But,
[1:25:11] you know, the story says I I believe
[1:25:13] it's Ali, you know, the the the greatest
[1:25:17] boxer that ever was, but he says, you
[1:25:20] know, but when he goes home with the
[1:25:23] paycheck and his wife, he's the one that
[1:25:26] has been in the ring and he's the one
[1:25:28] that's fought and he's the one that, you
[1:25:31] know, had to take the blows, but he went
[1:25:34] but but when he goes home with the
[1:25:35] paycheck, Amen. than his wife is more
[1:25:38] than a conqueror. Amen. I think that
[1:25:41] that's how we should view our life as as
[1:25:44] the queen of heaven. Amen. As joint hes
[1:25:47] with Christ Jesus. Amen. He he's he's
[1:25:51] the one that has already overcome the
[1:25:53] world. And because he is now living in
[1:25:57] your life and and and and it's a blank
[1:26:00] checkbook. Whatever you ask in my name,
[1:26:03] I will give it to you. Healing is not
[1:26:06] out of reach. Deliverance is not of out
[1:26:08] of reach. Refilling of the Holy Ghost is
[1:26:11] not out of reach because we are more
[1:26:14] than conquerors. He's already paid the
[1:26:16] price at Calvary. We are not beggars. We
[1:26:19] are not trying to just limp along
[1:26:22] through life and watching what is
[1:26:24] happening in Israel and Iran and Russia
[1:26:27] and Ukraine and the world falling apart
[1:26:30] all around us and we're just beggars and
[1:26:33] limping along. And where's our joy?
[1:26:35] Where's our peace? Where's our
[1:26:37] satisfaction and no motive and no
[1:26:39] purpose in life? But we are filled with
[1:26:42] the Holy Ghost. Uh we have been placed
[1:26:45] as adopted sons and daughters of God. Uh
[1:26:48] we have the title deed and the abstract
[1:26:50] to it. There's nothing against us.
[1:26:53] There's not one claim, not one lean
[1:26:55] against us. We are more than conquerors
[1:26:58] through Christ Jesus. Whatever we ask in
[1:27:01] his name, he promised to give it to us.
[1:27:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:27:09] The prophet of God would say it like
[1:27:10] this. He says, "We've we've been we've
[1:27:14] been crafted by the masterpiece as the,
[1:27:16] you know, the master builder. We're a
[1:27:18] masterpiece.
[1:27:20] Just no longer just driftwood getting
[1:27:23] caught up in the, you know, getting
[1:27:25] getting caught up in the weeds by the
[1:27:27] water. But you see, if we ever get
[1:27:30] caught up in the weeds, but because we
[1:27:34] have been crafted and built and designed
[1:27:37] by God himself and he's put a motor,
[1:27:41] he's put the Holy Ghost behind us that
[1:27:44] anything we get into, we can get out of
[1:27:47] it. I tell you friends, a real Christian
[1:27:51] when he gets down on the mat, he doesn't
[1:27:53] stay down, he gets back up again. He's a
[1:27:57] man of vision. But he's a man of
[1:27:58] purpose. He's the believer that is
[1:28:01] conquering the world uh even by our
[1:28:04] faith uh that God has given us in this
[1:28:07] age. It's a revelation. It's the six
[1:28:09] sense. It's the Holy Ghost. It's what's
[1:28:12] moving and pushing us back into those
[1:28:15] deep waters. I just want to say, amen.
[1:28:18] If you feel like you're in some weeds or
[1:28:21] some thickets and you can't get out of
[1:28:22] it, I tell you, there's a power here
[1:28:24] this morning that can get you out of it.
[1:28:27] and get you back into the deep and put
[1:28:30] direction and put ambition in your life.
[1:28:34] Hallelujah.
[1:28:35] You see, we're more than conquerors.
[1:28:38] Amen. How did Jesus overcome the devil?
[1:28:41] By the word.
[1:28:44] You young people remember this. You've
[1:28:46] heard it probably a thousand, maybe more
[1:28:48] than that. But don't you ever let it
[1:28:51] become common. The way you defeat the
[1:28:54] devil is by the word. He can beat you up
[1:28:57] with your emotions. He can build you up.
[1:29:00] Beat you up by the way you feel. He can
[1:29:03] make you feel like a loser. He can make
[1:29:05] you feel like you're not worthy of
[1:29:07] heaven. He can make you feel like you're
[1:29:09] the worst of the worst sinners. Uh but I
[1:29:11] want you to know that the word says you
[1:29:14] are sons and daughters of God and he
[1:29:18] gave his life for you because God has an
[1:29:21] ambition for your future. And that is
[1:29:24] not, Amen. not to be an outcast, uh, not
[1:29:27] to be a loser, not to just be someone
[1:29:30] that doesn't have joy and doesn't have
[1:29:32] peace, uh, and is just barely getting by
[1:29:35] in life. Uh, but Jesus died for you. He
[1:29:38] shed his blood for you that you can see
[1:29:42] you have a purpose in this life to be an
[1:29:45] overcomer.
[1:29:48] To be a conqueror.
[1:29:52] Hallelujah. We got to learn how to
[1:29:54] conquer those emotions.
[1:29:56] Conquer those feelings. Conquer those
[1:29:59] mind battles. Conquer that confusion.
[1:30:02] Conquer those those things that is
[1:30:05] always trying to make to always lying on
[1:30:09] us.
[1:30:10] I tell you, your feelings is the worst
[1:30:12] liar that you've got.
[1:30:16] Anytime you say you confess that you're
[1:30:19] a son or a daughter of God, watch it.
[1:30:21] The devil will anoint your feelings
[1:30:24] and it'll lie to you.
[1:30:27] And you've got to take your God-given
[1:30:29] faith and cast that thing off of you.
[1:30:33] Cast that thing down and say, "I will
[1:30:36] not imagine. I will not reason with you,
[1:30:38] Satan. I know who I am. I've got a
[1:30:40] revelation of who I am. My satisfaction
[1:30:43] is in Jesus Christ. Yay, though he take
[1:30:46] me, I still will not I still will not
[1:30:49] deny him. Yay, though he slay me. Yay,
[1:30:53] though he take everything from me, I
[1:30:55] will not deny him. I see Christ. I see
[1:30:59] him lifted up through the vindicated
[1:31:02] message of the hour. I see that my
[1:31:05] conqueror is risen and I am risen with
[1:31:08] him. And I am more than a conqueror
[1:31:11] through Christ Jesus.
[1:31:16] Satan's army brings diseases.
[1:31:19] That's what Satan is. He's a destroyer.
[1:31:23] Satan's whole kingdom. This whole Eden
[1:31:26] that we're living in. Satan's own Eden
[1:31:30] is full of sickness, death, sorrow,
[1:31:32] frustrations,
[1:31:34] and worry. And it's all because of the
[1:31:38] power of Satan.
[1:31:40] But God's God's power is love,
[1:31:44] joy, peace,
[1:31:48] fulfillment,
[1:31:49] contentment in the Holy Ghost. I tell
[1:31:52] you, there's two powers. Now, I I know
[1:31:55] that this is very elementary to us, but
[1:31:57] let's just let's just deal with it now.
[1:32:00] There's two powers, and Satan's power is
[1:32:03] going to torment you. He torments you
[1:32:05] every day. He tries to talk you into
[1:32:08] suicide. He tries to talk you into
[1:32:10] confessing you're not a son of God. He
[1:32:12] tries to talk you into into into
[1:32:15] believing that you're no good and you're
[1:32:17] never going to make the rapture and
[1:32:19] you're never going to be good enough and
[1:32:21] you're always failing and you're always
[1:32:23] making mistakes and but you see that's
[1:32:25] Satan's power and that's a tormenting
[1:32:28] power that tor that spirit torments you
[1:32:31] and he'll torment you as long as you let
[1:32:34] him. The more you give into him, the
[1:32:37] more he torments. The more, Amen, you
[1:32:40] give away your joy. He takes more of it
[1:32:42] from you. He takes your peace. He takes
[1:32:45] your mind. He inflicts you with
[1:32:47] nervousness. He inflicts you with a
[1:32:50] disease of unbelief. But there's another
[1:32:53] power. It's the power of God. And he's
[1:32:57] got the Holy Ghost. And he's pouring in
[1:33:00] an exhaust, inexhaustible fountain of
[1:33:02] goodness, which is love. and peace and
[1:33:05] joy and contentment in the Holy Ghost.
[1:33:08] Uh there's a power that it's a warfare
[1:33:10] that is raging day and night. Satan is
[1:33:13] trying to take your peace and God is
[1:33:15] here to give you peace. Uh Satan is here
[1:33:17] to take your joy. But God is here to
[1:33:19] give you joy. Satan is here lying to
[1:33:22] you, saying you'll never go, you're
[1:33:24] never going to make the rapture. But the
[1:33:26] Holy Ghost is here saying, "I've already
[1:33:28] quickened you. I've already raptured
[1:33:31] you. I've already placed you in heavenly
[1:33:35] places in Christ Jesus, and there's no
[1:33:38] way you can miss it.
[1:33:46] The two great forces, the prophet of God
[1:33:49] says they're coming together right now.
[1:33:52] They're battling. They're battling right
[1:33:54] here in this church service right now,
[1:33:58] right in this building. They battled day
[1:34:00] by day with you, every force. Satan
[1:34:04] following you along. That great big
[1:34:08] kingly priestly Goliath trying to scare
[1:34:11] the liver out of you.
[1:34:14] My think of that every day
[1:34:18] that great kingly priestly Goliath
[1:34:23] and the bigger you make him, the more
[1:34:25] you allow him to get bigger, he's going
[1:34:28] to grow.
[1:34:31] The more you listen to him, the more you
[1:34:33] listen to his boast, the more you allow
[1:34:37] him to afflict your mind, afflict your
[1:34:40] heart.
[1:34:42] In the scripture, he's 9 foot and 9 foot
[1:34:44] 6 in,
[1:34:46] but he'll grow to be 30 feet, 40 feet,
[1:34:50] 100 feet. He'll grow to be Mount
[1:34:54] Everest.
[1:34:56] And it's a Mount Everest with a voice
[1:34:59] speaking back to you right in your mind,
[1:35:01] right in your spirit, tormenting you.
[1:35:07] But you see,
[1:35:10] Jesus said, "By faith,
[1:35:14] you can cast down mountains.
[1:35:17] By the faith of God, the same faith that
[1:35:20] created the universe. The same faith
[1:35:22] that put the worlds into into their
[1:35:24] orbits and the sun and the moon and the
[1:35:26] stars and placed them positionally. The
[1:35:28] Holy Ghost is here positionally placing
[1:35:31] the church in their orbit in heavenly
[1:35:34] places that they can take the faith of
[1:35:37] God and speak to that mountain.
[1:35:42] And I don't care if it's Mount Everest,
[1:35:44] it's demonic powers that is waring
[1:35:47] against your mind. Take the word of God
[1:35:51] and get some gumption about you and
[1:35:54] speak to that thing.
[1:35:57] Speak to that sickness. Speak to
[1:35:59] discouragement. Speak to fear. Speak to
[1:36:02] all of those things that is trying to
[1:36:05] rob you of your joy.
[1:36:08] [Music]
[1:36:11] You see, we're protected with the whole
[1:36:12] armor of God.
[1:36:14] breastplate of righteousness,
[1:36:18] shield of faith, the sword of the
[1:36:20] spirit, feed shot with the preparation
[1:36:22] of the gospel of peace. You say, "Well,
[1:36:25] what where where where do we get that
[1:36:27] whole armor?" It's the word of God. It's
[1:36:30] the word of God. That's our defense.
[1:36:33] Amen. When you're standing behind the
[1:36:35] word of God, that that's your shield of
[1:36:38] faith. That's your breastplate of
[1:36:40] righteousness.
[1:36:41] That is the thing that keeps the devil
[1:36:45] from tormenting you.
[1:36:49] It keeps the devil from your heart. It
[1:36:52] keeps the de devil out of your emotions
[1:36:55] because you judge that thing. Is that
[1:36:58] God or is that the devil?
[1:37:01] Because God doesn't come to bring
[1:37:02] condemnation. It's the devil that brings
[1:37:05] condemnation. God doesn't come to take
[1:37:07] away your joy. God comes to give you
[1:37:10] joy.
[1:37:12] And if he has to give you joy by
[1:37:14] bringing correction, he'll do it. But
[1:37:16] it's correction is never to destroy you.
[1:37:18] Correction is to get that tormenting
[1:37:21] spirit out of your life and free you
[1:37:23] from condemnation to bring you back to
[1:37:26] your joy,
[1:37:29] contentment.
[1:37:32] You see, Satan's army brings diseases.
[1:37:35] And God's army is commissioned to cast
[1:37:38] them out. Every time Satan throws
[1:37:41] something on you, God's army is to cast
[1:37:43] him out. In my name, you shall cast out
[1:37:46] devils. Those mind battles that are
[1:37:48] trying to tell you that you're not going
[1:37:49] to make it. It's a devil.
[1:37:52] I didn't say you're possessed with the
[1:37:53] devil. I'm saying it's the devil that's
[1:37:55] trying to anoint you and anoint your
[1:37:57] mind and anoint your spirit to reason
[1:38:00] against the word of God.
[1:38:06] Hallelujah.
[1:38:08] You see and now this is a little bit
[1:38:10] lengthy but I feel like reading it. You
[1:38:13] see the power that will raise us up is
[1:38:16] right in us now. Do you believe that?
[1:38:18] What what power is he talking about?
[1:38:20] It's the Holy Ghost. We are now in
[1:38:22] heavenly places. We are now in the power
[1:38:24] of the resurrection. If there wasn't a
[1:38:26] law to that, sons and daughters of God
[1:38:28] would create them a world out here and
[1:38:29] go live a private life on it. You have
[1:38:32] the power in you to do it. If you've got
[1:38:33] a shadow of the power of God in you, you
[1:38:36] got power to do it. God is omnipotent.
[1:38:40] You see what I mean? The power that's in
[1:38:42] you will make you could speak a world
[1:38:44] into existence and go live on it.
[1:38:46] Hallelujah. There you are. That's what
[1:38:49] power is in the church now. But it is
[1:38:52] controlled by a law and that law is not
[1:38:55] keeping a bunch of commandments. It's a
[1:38:56] law of faith. Jesus said all things are
[1:38:59] possible to them that believe. If you
[1:39:01] don't believe it, whatever God will lead
[1:39:03] your soul, and if you can believe it,
[1:39:06] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:39:09] believe, that is yours. Amen. I want to
[1:39:12] read it again. Whatever God will lead
[1:39:16] your soul to believe, that is yours. Let
[1:39:19] let let me just put it in in my way of
[1:39:22] seeing it. Whatever you allow the Holy
[1:39:25] Ghost to lead you to believe that is
[1:39:28] yours because Jesus is here. The windows
[1:39:31] of heaven is open. The power of
[1:39:34] revelation has been released to the
[1:39:36] bride. But it's whatever you allow the
[1:39:39] Holy Ghost to lead you to believe that
[1:39:42] is your possession.
[1:39:47] You say, "Well, what do what do you mean
[1:39:48] by that?" Well, I'll tell you this. The
[1:39:50] Holy Ghost is our lead. He's our guide.
[1:39:53] It's the spirit of truth that is leading
[1:39:55] us into all truth. But the problem of it
[1:39:59] is is sometimes we've got doors in our
[1:40:02] heart that we won't open up so the Holy
[1:40:05] Ghost can come in and take control and
[1:40:08] and allow the and allow the word to have
[1:40:12] possession there.
[1:40:15] Got to open it up. We got to invite him
[1:40:19] in. Take over our pride. Take over the
[1:40:23] hurts. Take over our past. Take over
[1:40:27] devil spirits. Take over lust demons.
[1:40:30] Take over things that the devil is
[1:40:33] trying to root us into the world.
[1:40:36] And allow him to lead us to believe in
[1:40:40] total deliverance.
[1:40:43] Our redemptive rights being made
[1:40:45] manifest in our hearts.
[1:40:49] Every place the souls of your foot can
[1:40:52] set up set upon by faith, God gives it
[1:40:54] to you. It's yours. You possess it. If
[1:40:57] you can find the key to this law of
[1:40:59] faith that opens it to you, you see what
[1:41:01] I mean? That power is controlled by if
[1:41:05] you are a son of God, you're a daughter
[1:41:07] of God that never leaves you. It's with
[1:41:10] you all the time. What's with you all
[1:41:13] the time? The power that can create
[1:41:16] worlds. The power that can defeat the
[1:41:19] devil. The power that can bring joy into
[1:41:23] your life. peace in your life, real Holy
[1:41:27] Ghost revival in your life. It's with
[1:41:30] you all the time.
[1:41:35] I know this is very elementary to us,
[1:41:39] but it's what God gave me.
[1:41:42] It's with you all the time, but your
[1:41:44] faith gets away from it.
[1:41:48] But it's still there.
[1:41:50] When you are saved, God gives you faith
[1:41:52] to rise from the muck of the earth. Your
[1:41:54] faith overcomes the things of the world.
[1:41:56] What is your faith? Your faith in that
[1:42:00] act that God has did in you to make you
[1:42:03] a son of God. You quit your lying. You
[1:42:05] quit your stealing. You quit your
[1:42:07] drinking because your faith rises you up
[1:42:10] above it. If you don't do it, you don't
[1:42:12] have any faith. And by faith are you
[1:42:15] saved. And that through grace. as much
[1:42:18] as your faith will be released. That's
[1:42:21] how much power you can have because in
[1:42:24] you dwells the power to make heaven and
[1:42:27] earth. Well, how many will believe that?
[1:42:30] How many will stand upon that? Uh, amen.
[1:42:33] The revelation that God has released in
[1:42:35] this hour, amen, is to give you a
[1:42:38] conquering, overcoming faith. And faith
[1:42:42] is not a peacemaker. Faith uh is not
[1:42:46] just putting up with things. Uh faith is
[1:42:49] a conqueror. Faith is an overcomer.
[1:42:53] Faith stomps the devil. The thing that
[1:42:56] once held you, you stomp it under your
[1:42:59] feet. It's the conquering power of the
[1:43:04] Holy Ghost in your life.
[1:43:07] Hallelujah.
[1:43:09] It never leaves you.
[1:43:13] It's always there. But you've got to
[1:43:16] release your faith. You've got to let
[1:43:18] your faith be anointed. Let your faith
[1:43:21] be activated.
[1:43:24] Hallelujah.
[1:43:26] It's not God's will for us to be
[1:43:29] tormented. It's not God's will for us to
[1:43:32] live in fear. It's not God's will for us
[1:43:34] to have frustrations and nervousness and
[1:43:37] tension always holding us earthbound. We
[1:43:41] are conquerors.
[1:43:48] Hallelujah.
[1:43:50] Then what kind of people ought we to be
[1:43:53] having in having faith in this great
[1:43:55] redeeming Christ that lives in us? This
[1:43:59] smitten rock that never leaves the
[1:44:02] church. I am with you always even to the
[1:44:05] end of the world. The everpresence of
[1:44:06] the great gusher of salvation and power
[1:44:08] that poured forth from Calvary into the
[1:44:10] church. The everpresence of the living
[1:44:13] God. The great flowing smitten rock that
[1:44:15] goes with us in our journey.
[1:44:19] What are we to do? What what are we to
[1:44:21] do to that rock? Speak.
[1:44:24] Speak to that rock.
[1:44:27] He already died for us at Calvary, but
[1:44:29] now that gusher, the fountain of living
[1:44:33] water is just flowing, gushing from the
[1:44:36] word. And now we're walking. We're
[1:44:39] walking with him as Adam did before the
[1:44:42] fall. But now he's redeemed us. We've
[1:44:45] heard his voice. Adam, Adam, where art
[1:44:48] thou? And we've responded to the call.
[1:44:51] The opening of the word released our
[1:44:52] name. And we heard our name. And he
[1:44:55] said, "Come walk with me. Come. I've
[1:44:58] died for you. Now I claim you for
[1:45:00] redemption. I claim you for fellowship.
[1:45:02] I claim your hands. I claim your heart.
[1:45:04] I claim your mind. I claim everything
[1:45:07] about you. And now the book is in your
[1:45:09] hands. And it's in your mouth. And it's
[1:45:12] time that you claim your rights. Uh
[1:45:14] claim your joy. Claim your family. Claim
[1:45:16] your right. Claim your mind. Claim your
[1:45:18] heart. Claim what Jesus died for you at
[1:45:22] Calvary. You don't have to have a
[1:45:24] wounded spirit. You don't have to have a
[1:45:26] wounded heart. You don't have to have a
[1:45:28] jealous spirit. You can be free by the
[1:45:31] power of the Holy Ghost.
[1:45:38] We are born again. 1 Peter 1:23-2.
[1:45:44] being born again, not of corruptible
[1:45:47] seed, but of incorruptible
[1:45:50] by the word of God, which liveth and
[1:45:52] abideth forever. For all flesh is as
[1:45:55] grass grass, that's what you're battling
[1:45:57] with daily. All flesh is as grass.
[1:46:01] That's that weary. That's the thing that
[1:46:04] tries to get into your spirit. That's
[1:46:06] that's that tormenting thing that that
[1:46:09] gets when you're all tired and weary and
[1:46:12] maybe fighting some nervousness from
[1:46:14] from having to work in the world or rub
[1:46:16] shoulders with the world and those
[1:46:18] spirits are trying to attach themselves
[1:46:19] to you. It's only because you're just
[1:46:22] grass that fadeth. You're you're this
[1:46:25] flesh. This flesh is not the real you.
[1:46:29] this flesh. You don't have your redeemed
[1:46:32] body yet, but there is a soul that was
[1:46:35] in the eternal thoughts of God that has
[1:46:37] been placed within this frail grass,
[1:46:40] this flesh that is withering daily.
[1:46:43] Daily, we're getting weaker daily. We
[1:46:47] struggle with this. But there is a word.
[1:46:52] We are born again not of corruption, but
[1:46:56] of the incorruptible word. seed and that
[1:47:00] is that which fights this. The soul that
[1:47:05] has been born again by the word is
[1:47:07] continually fighting this.
[1:47:13] Why do I fight weary? Why why do I fight
[1:47:15] the struggles? Why why do I fight what I
[1:47:18] fight? It's because your but just like
[1:47:22] grass that witherth.
[1:47:24] But God has placed a conqueror in you.
[1:47:29] This is what overcomes the world, even
[1:47:32] our faith. And our faith is the six
[1:47:35] sense. And the six sense is the Holy
[1:47:38] Ghost. And greater is he, the six sense
[1:47:41] that is in you, than he that's in this
[1:47:44] world.
[1:47:46] Greater is he that's in this flesh than
[1:47:49] the flesh itself.
[1:47:52] This flesh may die and go into the
[1:47:54] grave, but greater is the soul that's
[1:47:56] been redeemed, that's been quickened to
[1:47:58] life than the flesh that has taken its
[1:48:02] last breath and goes into the grave. The
[1:48:04] last breath in this body, you step into
[1:48:08] that theophony body with the next.
[1:48:16] All the glory of man is is as the flower
[1:48:18] of grass. The grass witherth, the flower
[1:48:21] thereof fallth away,
[1:48:23] but the word of the Lord endureth
[1:48:25] forever. And this is the word which by
[1:48:27] the gospel is preached unto you. I want
[1:48:32] you to catch that. Now I'm putting
[1:48:34] emphasis. The word of the Lord endureth
[1:48:37] forever.
[1:48:39] Our flesh is as grass. All the glory of
[1:48:42] man is as the flower of grass that that
[1:48:46] witherth and it fallth away. But the
[1:48:50] word of the Lord endureth forever. And
[1:48:53] that is the incorruptible seed that we
[1:48:57] are born by is the word that endureth
[1:49:01] forever. And this is the word which by
[1:49:04] the gospel is preached unto you. We are
[1:49:08] not preaching down to you according to
[1:49:10] your flesh. Down to you. Down to you. If
[1:49:13] you would stop this and stop that. If
[1:49:15] you'd be better if you do this and do
[1:49:17] that. No sir, we are not uh we are not
[1:49:20] looking at something that fadeth away
[1:49:23] that just witherth away. But we are
[1:49:25] looking at a divine promise. We are
[1:49:27] looking at a divine attribute. We are
[1:49:30] looking at an incorruptible word seed
[1:49:34] that you are born by. Hallelujah. The
[1:49:38] gospel that we preaching to you is not
[1:49:40] according to something that just fades
[1:49:42] away. It's a promise.
[1:49:46] We are preaching not to your flesh. We
[1:49:49] are preaching to your soul. It is the
[1:49:52] soul that is conquering the flesh and
[1:49:56] bringing it under subjection to the word
[1:49:59] that never will fail.
[1:50:05] Your health may fail. Your mind may
[1:50:06] fail. Your body may fail. But the word
[1:50:09] will never fail. Hallelujah.
[1:50:15] A person that the prophet of God says a
[1:50:17] person that has the Holy Ghost can
[1:50:19] actually go totally insane and do things
[1:50:21] that is not right.
[1:50:23] And it doesn't mean that they're not
[1:50:25] right or that they're lost. It doesn't
[1:50:28] mean that they're not lost.
[1:50:31] Oh, how the devil hates that.
[1:50:35] how the devil is continually trying to
[1:50:37] bring fear, trying to rule you with
[1:50:40] fear, trying to control you with fear,
[1:50:43] but I say down with fear and up with
[1:50:46] faith.
[1:50:50] We're not preaching a high breed gospel.
[1:50:53] We're not preaching a a gospel that is
[1:50:56] according to your works.
[1:50:58] We're preaching a restored gospel.
[1:51:01] We're resto we're we're preaching a
[1:51:03] gospel that's been restored back to the
[1:51:05] original seed.
[1:51:07] We are preaching a pure undefiled spoken
[1:51:11] word seed that is a perfect connection
[1:51:14] with your soul.
[1:51:18] Nothing else can fit in that soul but
[1:51:20] the word of God.
[1:51:22] It's the word coming to the word.
[1:51:24] Hallelujah.
[1:51:28] We're not preaching something that has
[1:51:30] no power, but we're preaching a creative
[1:51:32] word that cannot return void.
[1:51:37] It cannot return void.
[1:51:40] Just as just as there's snow on the
[1:51:44] mountains and then the summer comes and
[1:51:46] begins to melt the snow and then and
[1:51:48] then the water begins to fold down and
[1:51:50] and begins to water the crops and water
[1:51:53] the grass. And so it is the word. will
[1:51:56] not return void. For all things work
[1:51:59] according work together for good to them
[1:52:01] who love God.
[1:52:03] You may come against some mountains. You
[1:52:05] may come against some struggles. You may
[1:52:08] go against some great strains in life.
[1:52:10] But God has got some water
[1:52:15] out of the trial. He's got some water
[1:52:18] that comes and flows upon your soul and
[1:52:21] begins to bring forth exactly what he
[1:52:24] promised.
[1:52:27] I hope I'm not all over the place this
[1:52:29] morning.
[1:52:31] Out of the very thing the devil is
[1:52:33] saying it's going to defeat you is the
[1:52:35] very thing that God's going to bring a
[1:52:37] refreshment out of that smitten rock
[1:52:40] that's going to manifest the promises of
[1:52:42] God in your life.
[1:52:44] The very thing that Satan is trying to
[1:52:46] bring defeat, God brings forth life.
[1:52:52] We're not preaching a dead gospel.
[1:52:55] We're not preaching a gospel of a dead
[1:52:57] religion that has no spirit touch to it.
[1:53:01] But we believe that the mechanics and
[1:53:03] the dynamics have come together. And we
[1:53:06] have been waiting for seven church ages.
[1:53:08] There's been churches, churches, and
[1:53:09] brides and brides and churches and
[1:53:10] brides. But the prophet of God says
[1:53:12] there's coming one. And I believe that
[1:53:15] the prophet of God identify that the
[1:53:16] bride that has been created by this
[1:53:18] message is that one.
[1:53:22] We are not born by flesh and blood. We
[1:53:24] are born by the creative word of life.
[1:53:31] Hallelujah. This is a powerful gospel.
[1:53:34] This is a conquering overcoming gospel.
[1:53:37] This is a gospel that has healing and
[1:53:39] delivering and it sets the captives free
[1:53:42] gospel. This is not a gospel that is
[1:53:44] psychology that tries to teach you how
[1:53:47] to cope with life. This is a this is a
[1:53:49] cycle breaking gospel. This is a This is
[1:53:53] a gospel that breaks the curses off of
[1:53:55] lives. It breaks the curses off of
[1:53:57] families. It It breaks the strongholds
[1:54:00] of the devil where it passes down from
[1:54:02] generation to generation. But there's
[1:54:05] one that stands up and says, "For me in
[1:54:08] my house, the cycle is broke."
[1:54:11] As for me in my house, I'm looking at
[1:54:13] the blood that is flowing from Calvar's
[1:54:16] flow. And I'm saying the blood of
[1:54:19] Calvary breaks the curse.
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:23] I'm not looking to flesh and blood any
[1:54:25] longer. I'm looking at the faith that's
[1:54:28] been born into my soul and I break in
[1:54:31] the kind the curse.
[1:54:34] I'm going to say it like brother Wayne.
[1:54:35] You know, I was actually looking it up
[1:54:37] and you know, you're you're you're born
[1:54:40] in a certain month and you're born under
[1:54:42] a certain consolation. What am I July?
[1:54:45] Cancer. Yeah. You know, I looked it up
[1:54:47] and July is cancer and it has different
[1:54:51] things, you know, and
[1:54:54] you look it up and you're thinking,
[1:54:56] "Wow." But I like what I just heard,
[1:54:59] Brother Wayne. He says, "I'm he says he
[1:55:01] looked at that cloud and he says, I'm
[1:55:03] I'm I'm glad that the prophet of God
[1:55:05] called that a consolation."
[1:55:08] He says, "Because I've been born not of
[1:55:12] a natural consolation, but I've been
[1:55:14] born again of another consolation."
[1:55:18] That's my daddy. I've been born under
[1:55:21] the message. I don't have to look at my
[1:55:25] natural physical identity and say,
[1:55:27] "Well, well, I've got to have this and
[1:55:29] I'm going to be this and I'm going to
[1:55:30] and I can tell you and just put up with
[1:55:32] things." I say, "We're a cycle breaking
[1:55:34] people. We're a bloodbot, holy
[1:55:37] ghostfilled cycle breaking church of the
[1:55:40] living God that does that when the devil
[1:55:42] torn me and say you're going to have a
[1:55:44] temper just like your daddy had a
[1:55:45] temper. You stand up and say I've been
[1:55:47] born of another consolation. I born of
[1:55:50] another daddy and I rebuke that spirit.
[1:55:53] I stand upon the head of that giant and
[1:55:57] I say Satan, you don't have enough.
[1:56:02] I got to put up with this and I got to
[1:56:04] put up with this and well it's his
[1:56:05] passion run to my family. No, it doesn't
[1:56:08] have to control you.
[1:56:12] Cover yourself with a bleach of the Holy
[1:56:16] Ghost
[1:56:19] and have courage to speak the word over
[1:56:22] your life.
[1:56:25] Break that thing. It's a positive
[1:56:27] gospel, not a negative gospel. positive
[1:56:30] gospel.
[1:56:31] We're not a negative people singing the
[1:56:34] blues all the time. Woe is me. Where's
[1:56:36] my joy? Where's my happiness? Where's my
[1:56:38] family? Where's this? Where's that? I
[1:56:39] wish people love me. Bury the thing
[1:56:45] and be resurrected in Christ.
[1:56:50] Cast down emotions. Cast down reasoning.
[1:56:56] But Paul said, "I've died daily. That
[1:56:59] thing's going to try to come back and
[1:57:01] you're going to have to keep him dead."
[1:57:04] Paul said, "I'm not ashamed of the
[1:57:05] gospel,
[1:57:07] for it is the power of God unto
[1:57:09] salvation to everyone that believes." He
[1:57:11] didn't exclude anyone. It's to the
[1:57:14] Greeks. It's to the Jews. It's to this
[1:57:17] group. It's to that group. It's to this
[1:57:19] ethical. It's to It's to whatever
[1:57:21] nation. It's to the believer. And Paul
[1:57:23] said, "I've seen it done. I'm not
[1:57:25] ashamed of the gospel.
[1:57:27] Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:57:30] Hallelujah. And the prophet of God.
[1:57:32] Amen. Jewel. I believe I believe it's
[1:57:34] Joel. The second chapter, he's of the
[1:57:36] time of restitution of all things. And
[1:57:38] he says, Amen. When the Holy Ghost is
[1:57:40] being poured out, the refreshing from
[1:57:42] heaven is poured out. There will be a
[1:57:44] people that's not ashamed,
[1:57:47] not ashamed to be identified as a Holy
[1:57:49] Ghost tongue talking born again holy
[1:57:52] roller and not of the world. Just a holy
[1:57:56] roller, just a brand of mine. I'm not
[1:57:57] ashamed. It's broke the cycles. It's
[1:58:00] broke the chains off of my life.
[1:58:05] And if it can do it for me, it'll do it
[1:58:06] for you.
[1:58:09] Hallelujah.
[1:58:10] You see, do I have a little bit more
[1:58:12] time?
[1:58:15] Says one, Psalms 110 and three says,
[1:58:18] "Thy people,
[1:58:21] let's just thy people shall be willing."
[1:58:26] Say, "Willing."
[1:58:28] Thy people, whose people? God's people,
[1:58:30] the bride of Christ shall be willing.
[1:58:36] That word willing means spontaneous.
[1:58:39] Oh, I love it. So, thy people shall be
[1:58:43] spontaneous
[1:58:45] in the day of thy power.
[1:58:48] In the beauties of holiness, from the
[1:58:50] womb of the morning, thou hast the due
[1:58:52] of thy youth.
[1:58:55] So when the power of God is being
[1:58:59] revealed in the last days, there will be
[1:59:03] a people under expectation
[1:59:06] that is willing to act upon that power.
[1:59:13] You're not getting it. You see, when the
[1:59:17] fullness of the Godhead is revealed from
[1:59:21] heaven on earth
[1:59:23] and the God that is omnipotent,
[1:59:27] the God that's living in you, the God
[1:59:31] that has shown and proved and vindicated
[1:59:34] that he's the God that raises the dead,
[1:59:36] he's the God that changes situations,
[1:59:39] he's the God that restores. He's the God
[1:59:41] that heals cancer. He's the God that
[1:59:43] delivers the dope addict. He's the God
[1:59:46] that delivers the alcoholic, the drug
[1:59:48] addict. He's the God that is the same
[1:59:50] yesterday, today, and forever. He's
[1:59:53] Elohim, all powerful, selfsufficient.
[1:59:57] He doesn't need your help. Doesn't need
[1:59:59] your ability. Doesn't need your
[2:00:00] strength. He is all powerful within
[2:00:03] himself.
[2:00:05] When that power is revealed, there will
[2:00:08] be a bride that is spontaneous on the
[2:00:11] earth that will say, "Yes, Lord. I
[2:00:15] believe it, Lord." And they act upon the
[2:00:19] power that's been released to them in
[2:00:22] the last days.
[2:00:26] Now, works is faith expressed. One of
[2:00:28] the last sermons that Brother Brandham
[2:00:30] preached, he says, "I want to tell you
[2:00:32] something now. work on that pulsation,
[2:00:36] that spur of a moment like Joshua did,
[2:00:40] like Mary Magdalene and all those just
[2:00:43] that moment when something is revealed
[2:00:45] to you, grab it, hold to it, that spur
[2:00:49] of a moment. In other words, it's like
[2:00:52] this. When the prophet of God in the
[2:00:53] prayer line would begin to discern
[2:00:54] someone and tell them their condition
[2:00:58] and then then say, "They're going to
[2:01:00] miss it.
[2:01:02] they're going to miss it. And then say,
[2:01:06] "Act upon it. Respond to it. Don't let
[2:01:09] it pass you by. I'm talking to you." And
[2:01:12] then says, "They missed it. The light
[2:01:16] went over here. Now, brother so and so.
[2:01:19] You can have it." And begins to say your
[2:01:22] condition. And they act upon it. And
[2:01:24] says, "Now, that was for that person,
[2:01:26] but they wouldn't act upon it, so this
[2:01:28] person got it.
[2:01:32] You see thy people
[2:01:35] when the word of his power is being
[2:01:38] preached and the promises of rapture,
[2:01:41] the promises of grace and the promises
[2:01:43] of restoration, the promises of joy and
[2:01:46] happiness and contentment and life in
[2:01:48] the Holy Ghost is being preached to a
[2:01:51] people who's not looking at the fading
[2:01:54] body of their of humanity and the fraess
[2:01:57] of their own human mind, but they're
[2:01:59] holding to that promise.
[2:02:01] When the word is being preached in the
[2:02:04] power and demonstration of the Holy
[2:02:06] Ghost, my people will be spontaneous and
[2:02:09] they will say, "Yes, Lord. Yes, Lord.
[2:02:13] That's my joy. That's my healing. That's
[2:02:16] my revival. That's my rapture. That's my
[2:02:19] family. That's my mind."
[2:02:24] Not arguing, not debating, not
[2:02:26] wondering, "Can it be?" But say yes
[2:02:28] Lord.
[2:02:32] See the prophet of God would say the
[2:02:35] problem of it is
[2:02:38] he says instead of the straight word of
[2:02:39] God instead of the spiritfilled men in
[2:02:40] the church who were led by spirit given
[2:02:42] revelation there are now creeds and
[2:02:45] bylaws and educated guesses of educated
[2:02:47] men. Learning has taken the place of
[2:02:49] revelation. Reason has replaced faith.
[2:02:52] Program has replaced spontaneous praise
[2:02:54] in the Holy Ghost.
[2:02:57] Hallelujah. I would rather have
[2:03:00] spontaneous praise in the Holy Ghost
[2:03:01] from someone who is an outand-out
[2:03:04] repbate
[2:03:06] from someone. This whole community knows
[2:03:08] that they're nothing. They were but just
[2:03:10] a drug addict. But someone who responds
[2:03:13] to the word and they say, "That's me.
[2:03:15] That's my name. I'm healed. I'm
[2:03:17] delivered. I believe it's for me. I
[2:03:19] believe the rapture is for me. I don't
[2:03:20] believe that I have to stay the same." I
[2:03:22] would rather see that person stand up
[2:03:24] and shout the praises and the glory of
[2:03:26] God and even dance all over this
[2:03:28] building than someone sitting there
[2:03:31] listening to the promises of God and
[2:03:32] will not move and will not budge and
[2:03:34] will not release their faith. It's faith
[2:03:37] that overcomes the world. It's faith
[2:03:40] that overcomes mind battles. It's faith
[2:03:43] that overcomes fear. It's faith that
[2:03:45] overcomes the failure of the past. It is
[2:03:48] spontaneous Holy Ghost praise.
[2:03:54] Someone that'll take God at his word and
[2:03:56] quit looking at the years of failure and
[2:03:59] respond to the Holy Ghost when he's
[2:04:01] calling to you and say, "Yes, Lord."
[2:04:06] There's a deep calling to the deep. Yes,
[2:04:08] Lord.
[2:04:10] That's what I want to be. I want to be
[2:04:12] an overcomer. I want your joy. I want
[2:04:14] your peace.
[2:04:18] It's not by might. It's not by power.
[2:04:20] But it's by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[2:04:25] I'd rather see someone who's been in the
[2:04:27] message for 40 years, but the power of
[2:04:29] the Holy Ghost gets so a hold of their
[2:04:31] life that they begin to roll and swallow
[2:04:34] in the floor snotting. Amen. And getting
[2:04:36] their victory, the victory that the
[2:04:39] devil has been stealing from them for
[2:04:41] years and years.
[2:04:44] I'd rather real Holy Ghost
[2:04:47] spontaneous worship
[2:04:51] to have a real spirit touch
[2:04:56] light our fire.
[2:04:58] I tell you, there's five wise, there's
[2:05:00] five foolish.
[2:05:02] The problem with those five foolish is
[2:05:04] they didn't get a refilling of the Holy
[2:05:05] Ghost. They had oil, they had a light at
[2:05:08] one time, but they let it go out. But
[2:05:11] there was five wise. They got a
[2:05:12] refilling of the Holy Ghost. And I tell
[2:05:15] you, they were going through the same
[2:05:16] trials. They were going through the same
[2:05:17] darkness. They were going through the
[2:05:19] same tormenting spirits. But they had a
[2:05:22] refilling of the Holy Ghost to keep them
[2:05:23] going. And we need the dynamics which
[2:05:27] will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost.
[2:05:30] Pour it out. Oh God.
[2:05:33] bring us back to real spiritfilled
[2:05:36] Holy Ghost church services where people
[2:05:39] I don't care how long they've been
[2:05:41] sitting on a pew can leave this place
[2:05:43] changed
[2:05:48] speaking what the Lord laid on my heart
[2:05:50] I'm sorry it's too gone I'm too drunk
[2:05:55] it's time that we recognize the grace
[2:05:57] that God has given us in this age it's
[2:06:00] time we realize that we are under the
[2:06:01] unmmerited favor of omnipotence.
[2:06:05] The power of God, the power of God is
[2:06:08] favoring us. The power of God to change
[2:06:11] situations. The power of God to heal us.
[2:06:14] The power of God that can take to snatch
[2:06:17] you out of hell. The power of God that
[2:06:20] can give you young people a real genuine
[2:06:22] experience with God that you know that
[2:06:24] God lives and that he's the same
[2:06:26] yesterday, today, and forever. And he
[2:06:28] can answer your prayer. Len,
[2:06:31] there's a favor upon your life. There's
[2:06:34] a favor.
[2:06:36] There's a favor that God has placed upon
[2:06:39] this church, Pony. It's an unmmerited
[2:06:42] favor. Not because you deserve it. Not
[2:06:45] because you're good enough. Not because
[2:06:46] you know the message. It's because God's
[2:06:50] power has come to you. Because he knows
[2:06:54] you by name.
[2:07:02] But you got to let it work. You got to
[2:07:04] release your faith. It's the faith that
[2:07:07] overcomes the world.
[2:07:11] It's a gospel that's given by
[2:07:14] inspiration of the Holy Ghost. This
[2:07:16] gospel didn't come by intellects.
[2:07:19] This gospel didn't come by educated men.
[2:07:20] This gospel come by inspiration.
[2:07:23] It become by it come by inspiration of
[2:07:25] the Holy Ghost. And this gospel cannot
[2:07:28] be given to you by intellects. You can't
[2:07:30] learn yourself into deliverance. You
[2:07:32] can't learn your way into the rapture.
[2:07:35] It's got to be a message that is
[2:07:36] preached with a spirit touch by a people
[2:07:39] that is releasing faith in that promised
[2:07:42] word that is saying, "Yes, Lord. I
[2:07:44] believe it, Lord. Fill me again. Move in
[2:07:47] my home. Bless my pastor. Bless the
[2:07:50] musicians. Bless my children. Oh, get a
[2:07:53] hold of God. Get a hold of the horns of
[2:07:55] the altar and pray through. Pray through
[2:07:58] until you break the sound barrier. Break
[2:08:00] through until you break through your
[2:08:02] weariness. Break through your mind
[2:08:04] battles. Break through the things that's
[2:08:06] trying to keep you shackled. Break
[2:08:08] through those things that's telling you
[2:08:10] it's not for you. Break through and
[2:08:13] touch heaven.
[2:08:19] Let it stabilize you. Malachi 4 came to
[2:08:22] restore the faith.
[2:08:25] And upon this faith, I'll build my
[2:08:27] church. And it's a bedrock, solid,
[2:08:30] unmovable, unchanging revelation of
[2:08:33] Jesus Christ. That what he was yesterday
[2:08:36] in your life, he's the same today.
[2:08:40] When you broke through the sound barrier
[2:08:42] years ago and you knew that you were in
[2:08:44] the presence of God and you were just so
[2:08:47] lost and drunk in the Holy Ghost, he's
[2:08:49] the same God today.
[2:08:52] He didn't change. We changed. We leave
[2:08:56] him. We leave him at the bedside where
[2:08:59] he's there saying, "Pray, break through.
[2:09:02] I meet you. I'll help you. I'll revive
[2:09:05] you. I'll be your guide." But instead,
[2:09:07] we just go to bed. We wake up in the
[2:09:10] morning and we get lost in our chores,
[2:09:12] lost in our work, and we won't break
[2:09:14] through again. I tell you friends, it's
[2:09:16] time to come back to a real spirit touch
[2:09:18] where we know that he's the same
[2:09:19] yesterday, today, and forever in our
[2:09:22] lives. And he's still God. He still
[2:09:24] answers prayer. He still changes
[2:09:27] situations. But it takes a people called
[2:09:30] by my name to get a hold of the horns of
[2:09:33] the altar and pray through.
[2:09:43] Satan's doing everything in his power to
[2:09:44] destabilize.
[2:09:47] I don't know you. You may not ask me
[2:09:49] back, but but I'm telling you right now,
[2:09:52] I'm preaching in the name of the Lord.
[2:09:57] Satan is doing everything in his power
[2:09:58] to destabilize,
[2:10:00] destabilize homes,
[2:10:03] destabilize marriages. I'm not talking
[2:10:05] about Pawne. I'm talking about the world
[2:10:06] around
[2:10:08] destabilize churches,
[2:10:11] destabilize ministries,
[2:10:13] destabilize congregations
[2:10:16] because Satan recognizes
[2:10:19] that his time is short. But he also
[2:10:22] recognizes it's his time to wreck lives.
[2:10:25] You say, "How where do you get that?"
[2:10:26] Well, recognizing your day in his
[2:10:28] message. The devil has recognized is the
[2:10:30] time that he can wreck women, wreck the
[2:10:34] church, wreck the people. He's
[2:10:36] recognized it.
[2:10:38] He has recognized
[2:10:41] that this is the age that it'll be so
[2:10:43] close it would deceive the very elected
[2:10:45] if it were possible. But it's not
[2:10:47] possible.
[2:10:49] But Satan knows his time. He knows his
[2:10:52] age. He knows he's he's living in his
[2:10:55] own Eden.
[2:10:59] You see, that's why the the scripture
[2:11:01] says in 1 Thessalonians 5:21-22, "Prove
[2:11:04] all things,
[2:11:06] hold fast that which is good. Abstain
[2:11:09] from all appearance of evil."
[2:11:13] The prophet of God would quote that
[2:11:16] scripture and say, "Don't go on the
[2:11:18] devil's ground.
[2:11:20] You don't belong on the devil's ground."
[2:11:24] The prophet of God would say, "I I see
[2:11:26] that he seen three monkeys." One time, I
[2:11:27] believe it was in Florida, you know, the
[2:11:29] the little figurines. And he says it was
[2:11:31] on some maybe someone's desk. And he
[2:11:32] says it was three monkeys. One had his
[2:11:35] eye, you know, hands over his eyes. The
[2:11:36] other one had his fingers in his ears.
[2:11:38] The other one had his hands over his
[2:11:39] mouth. And he would say, you know, I
[2:11:41] wish I had that for my own desk because
[2:11:43] he was saying, "See no evil, hear no
[2:11:45] evil, speak no evil."
[2:11:48] He says that's a good thing for every
[2:11:50] single one of us to catch. Don't go on
[2:11:54] the devil's ground.
[2:11:56] Abstain from the very appearance of
[2:12:00] evil. You see, Hebrews 4:12 says that
[2:12:04] the word of God is quick and powerful
[2:12:06] and sharper than any two-edged sword,
[2:12:08] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[2:12:09] of soul and spirit and of the joints of
[2:12:11] marorrow, and as a discerner of the
[2:12:12] thoughts and intents of the heart.
[2:12:15] You see, that was that scripture that
[2:12:18] was made manifest as the Messiah sign of
[2:12:20] this last day to show us we have Holy
[2:12:23] Ghost discernment.
[2:12:25] The Messiah is the anointed word which
[2:12:28] is still discerning the thoughts and
[2:12:30] intents of the heart.
[2:12:33] You see, the prophet of God would say,
[2:12:35] "Real overcoming
[2:12:38] is recognizing the devil in all of his
[2:12:42] tricks."
[2:12:44] And then recognize that greater is he
[2:12:46] that is in you than he that is in the
[2:12:48] world.
[2:12:50] You see, the prophet of God would say in
[2:12:52] the, and I'm closing now, but just let
[2:12:54] me have your undivided attention, and
[2:12:56] we're bringing it to a real or trying to
[2:12:58] bring it to a climax here. In the room
[2:13:01] yesterday where some young Christians
[2:13:02] was, I said, if you were standing out
[2:13:04] here on the road and a car was coming
[2:13:06] down the road at 90 miles an hour out of
[2:13:09] control, you would get off that highway
[2:13:11] as quick as you could. You would jump,
[2:13:14] slide, do anything, get out of the way
[2:13:16] of that car. And that's the way that sin
[2:13:19] should be to a Christian because sin is
[2:13:22] associated with death. And as soon as
[2:13:24] you see sin in any form, jump from it.
[2:13:27] Get away from it. I don't care what you
[2:13:30] have to do. Get away from the very
[2:13:32] appearance of evil. Because remember to
[2:13:35] associate with sin is death. Just the
[2:13:38] same as standing there and let that car
[2:13:41] strike you. Don't just wait and see what
[2:13:43] it'll do. Get out of the way of it. the
[2:13:45] very appearance of evil. Shun it
[2:13:47] quickly. When you see a temptation
[2:13:49] coming up and sin, you know if it's
[2:13:52] something wrong, that death is lurking
[2:13:55] after you. Then get away from it just as
[2:13:58] quick as you would get away from an
[2:13:59] automobile approaching at 90 miles an
[2:14:01] hour. You'd want to get away from it
[2:14:03] right quick. Out of the way, jump,
[2:14:05] slide, run anyway. Just get away from
[2:14:07] it. And how that we know that we have
[2:14:10] life,
[2:14:11] oh, praise the Lord, is because that we
[2:14:15] hate sin. And we hate sin so bad that we
[2:14:20] know that death's associated there and
[2:14:22] we shun the very appearance of it. And
[2:14:25] any way we can get away from it, we
[2:14:27] jump, run, anything that we can do to
[2:14:29] keep away from sin because sin has death
[2:14:31] in it. And we sure don't want to
[2:14:33] associate anything in death. we want to
[2:14:37] keep away from. Brother Brandham would
[2:14:39] say again, says, "Oh, the stories of
[2:14:41] these 31 years around the world and
[2:14:43] around and around hearing the
[2:14:44] confessions and things, it raised the
[2:14:46] hair on your head to think of the
[2:14:47] things, hear them confess of what
[2:14:49] they've started, how innocent they was,
[2:14:52] and how beautiful sin looks and how
[2:14:55] attract attractive it looks to be. It's
[2:14:58] a way of death. Don't go in it. Whatever
[2:15:01] you do, shun the very appearance of
[2:15:04] evil."
[2:15:05] The Bible says as a dog goes to its
[2:15:07] vomit and a s to the wallow and the dog
[2:15:10] ought to know if the vomit made him sick
[2:15:13] enough to get out the first time, it'll
[2:15:16] do the same thing the second time. And
[2:15:19] if sin of the world will make a man
[2:15:21] realize that he's wrong once to make him
[2:15:24] repent, it'll do the second time. It'll
[2:15:27] do it the second time. So why not keep
[2:15:30] away from the thing anyhow? If it made
[2:15:32] you sick and you got rid of it, stay
[2:15:34] away from it. Keep out of the very
[2:15:37] appearance of evil.
[2:15:40] Again, God calls us to a so total
[2:15:42] separation from sin. Come out from among
[2:15:44] it. Be not partakers of it. Shun it the
[2:15:47] very appearance of evil. Separation
[2:15:49] completely annihilated from it. Stay
[2:15:51] your distance away from it. Don't tread
[2:15:54] upon its grounds. No matter how nice it
[2:15:57] looks, you people, you might think,
[2:16:00] "Here now, here it is. Brother Brandham,
[2:16:03] I sometimes I'm tempted to steal or
[2:16:05] sometimes I'm tempted to smoke." Or
[2:16:07] sometimes the women think I'm tempted to
[2:16:09] dress like the people of the world, you
[2:16:11] know, the the immoral clothes and
[2:16:12] things. I'm tempted the young ladies.
[2:16:14] Now, you think that's tempting? What
[2:16:16] about over here where you've got every
[2:16:19] little move to watch? See, in a
[2:16:21] ministry, what a greater thing it is. o
[2:16:24] over here and what they'd have to answer
[2:16:27] more for because you have to answer for
[2:16:30] your own you have to answer for your own
[2:16:32] souls but we have to answer for
[2:16:34] everybody we speak to
[2:16:39] sometimes we get things the devil puts
[2:16:41] in our spirits
[2:16:44] we know what I'm you know what I'm
[2:16:46] talking about imagination memory
[2:16:50] conscience reason affection
[2:16:53] hurts
[2:16:55] things get into our spirits
[2:16:59] and if it's not dealt with, it begins to
[2:17:01] fester.
[2:17:04] Things will become a festering sore.
[2:17:07] Now, you can you can agree with me. Even
[2:17:09] you boys can agree with me on this. You
[2:17:12] get you you can be out there maybe in a
[2:17:13] flower garden or something. You get just
[2:17:15] a little bitty little bitty thorn
[2:17:18] in your in in your palm or your finger
[2:17:21] or something and man that thing hurts.
[2:17:25] But you know what's funny is as small as
[2:17:28] that thing is, if you don't deal with
[2:17:30] it, that thing gets to festering.
[2:17:35] And that thing will hurt you and hurt.
[2:17:39] It's it's almost worse than just getting
[2:17:42] stabbed or or getting cut or something.
[2:17:46] You know what a bruised cell will lead
[2:17:48] to? It'll lead to cancer
[2:17:52] because it's something that's backslid.
[2:17:56] something that
[2:17:58] something that causes pain and and then
[2:18:01] a life gets in it
[2:18:03] and then it becomes a multiplication of
[2:18:05] cells upon cells until what was very
[2:18:09] small that if it would have been dealt
[2:18:11] with it just begins to consume your
[2:18:13] life.
[2:18:16] I'm still this is our victory
[2:18:20] even our faith.
[2:18:23] You see the prophet of God would say he
[2:18:26] would come to a does God care but then
[2:18:29] he would ask but do we care?
[2:18:33] He would say you know I went to a
[2:18:35] meeting and I found out that God was
[2:18:37] moving and and God they would come into
[2:18:39] the line and they would be healed and
[2:18:40] within another couple of days they would
[2:18:42] be back in the line with the same
[2:18:44] conditions again. He says, "I wonder
[2:18:46] what was causing it." He said, "The
[2:18:48] angel of the Lord told me they've got to
[2:18:49] unconfess sin."
[2:18:52] He says, "You make them confess those
[2:18:54] things."
[2:18:56] You know how
[2:18:58] the devil tries
[2:19:01] to blow things up in our lives
[2:19:06] and make us embarrassed and ashamed.
[2:19:10] And yet here we are, every one of us
[2:19:13] needing the grace of God in our lives.
[2:19:18] And he'll make us so, it'll make us so
[2:19:20] much that we can't actually repent to
[2:19:23] our wife. Or then a spirit of pride
[2:19:26] begins to get in there and a wife can't
[2:19:27] repent to a husband or a husband can't
[2:19:29] repent to and then children then and you
[2:19:31] watch nervousness begins to consume that
[2:19:34] home.
[2:19:36] strains begin to get into a marriage.
[2:19:40] All of the sudden, the world begins to
[2:19:41] creep in. All of the sudden, appetites
[2:19:44] that have been dead begins to be
[2:19:46] reignited.
[2:19:48] All because of maybe something so small
[2:19:50] as just a little thorn that just got in
[2:19:52] just below the skin, but it's not dealt
[2:19:55] with. But you see, this is what
[2:19:59] overcomes the world.
[2:20:01] We've got an ambition.
[2:20:04] We're not just trying to make it to the
[2:20:06] next day. We're not trying to bring
[2:20:09] satisfaction with another job or a big
[2:20:11] job or this or that or or have no
[2:20:14] because a soul that has been
[2:20:17] predestinated will never be satisfied
[2:20:20] outside of true fellowship with Christ.
[2:20:22] I think I've got this microphone wet.
[2:20:25] That's what that's that is.
[2:20:29] You see,
[2:20:31] we have come to a change of order.
[2:20:36] Now, under the lit levitical priesthood,
[2:20:38] how how many understands what I'm
[2:20:39] talking about? A change of order. There
[2:20:41] was a change of order when Jesus came.
[2:20:43] It was a change of dispensation. And
[2:20:45] Paul says, "Now we have moved from the
[2:20:47] Levitical priesthood, which was under
[2:20:49] law, and we move to grace, which is the
[2:20:51] order of Melzdc, which is the power of
[2:20:55] an endless life. It's the word made
[2:20:57] flesh.
[2:21:00] Under the old water, old order, you had
[2:21:03] to deal with life. What you were was
[2:21:06] what you were.
[2:21:09] You you you could you looked in the
[2:21:11] mirror and thanks, buddy. You looked
[2:21:15] you looked in the mirror
[2:21:19] and you and you looked at yourself and
[2:21:21] said, "Man, I hate that guy."
[2:21:24] You could comb your hair. You could
[2:21:26] brush your teeth. He could put on a
[2:21:27] smile, but it but way down in your
[2:21:30] spirit, you're fighting with things and
[2:21:31] you're looking and say, "Man, I I hate
[2:21:33] life.
[2:21:34] I hate dealing with myself."
[2:21:37] You're trying to put on the greatest
[2:21:39] thing and the greatest, you know,
[2:21:42] ambitions and this and that, but then
[2:21:44] you find in your spirit that you're just
[2:21:45] floating,
[2:21:47] just trying to get by, just trying.
[2:21:50] And the devil's thereounding you
[2:21:52] andounding you.
[2:21:56] But you see, when Paul said, "We've
[2:21:58] changed the order,
[2:22:00] the power of omnipotence has come down
[2:22:03] from heaven, and we're not on the
[2:22:06] outside looking in and saying, I wish I
[2:22:08] could. I want to
[2:22:12] but the faith was introduced to the
[2:22:15] church that under this order you can
[2:22:19] come into the holiest of holies and you
[2:22:21] can lay down your life and and lay down
[2:22:24] the the things that is consuming you and
[2:22:27] lay it down and under this order of
[2:22:29] Melzdc there's a power to change habits
[2:22:33] change desires heal spirits
[2:22:38] mental broken marriages
[2:22:42] to bring such a transforming power. All
[2:22:47] because we are willing
[2:22:50] to recognize
[2:22:52] that we are under another order.
[2:22:57] Now the prophet of God says you know
[2:23:02] when John he wrote here he didn't have
[2:23:05] my troubles
[2:23:09] this is what overcomes the world
[2:23:10] everyone that is born of God overcomes
[2:23:12] the world this is what overcomes the
[2:23:14] world even our faith says John he wrote
[2:23:16] that he didn't have my troubles you know
[2:23:18] I I've actually heard that no no one
[2:23:20] understands me no no no one knows what
[2:23:22] I'm going through every everyone's got
[2:23:24] different obstacles than I've got and no
[2:23:26] one can identify with me.
[2:23:30] Do do you realize that as the devil
[2:23:34] that's trying to put a selfish spirit
[2:23:35] upon you?
[2:23:38] I'm not saying just you. I'm saying the
[2:23:39] world. The devil trying to isolate you,
[2:23:42] trying to look at yourself and well, my
[2:23:44] problem is just a special problem.
[2:23:49] But the pro but here the prophet is
[2:23:51] saying, you know, he John didn't have my
[2:23:53] troubles. He he didn't have to deal with
[2:23:55] the folk that I deal with.
[2:23:57] He did not have to go through the things
[2:23:58] that I do.
[2:24:00] He may not had to deal with the same
[2:24:03] folk.
[2:24:05] He may not had to overcome the same
[2:24:07] thing. But he never excluded them.
[2:24:12] For he said this, the faith that the
[2:24:15] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[2:24:18] world, the whole thing. How is it? Get
[2:24:20] faith in it right above it.
[2:24:24] That's when the prophet of God says
[2:24:26] faith is a conqueror. Faith is an
[2:24:27] overcomer. It's not a peacemaker.
[2:24:31] Let the musicians come.
[2:24:34] You see, the prophet would say it like
[2:24:36] this.
[2:24:38] If I can just have your undivided
[2:24:39] attention again.
[2:24:42] It seems like the Christian life if the
[2:24:43] fellow is not absolutely centered on
[2:24:45] Christ. The Christian life seems like
[2:24:48] holds so many disappointments.
[2:24:52] But those disappointments here you are
[2:24:54] now are God's divine will happening for
[2:24:57] us
[2:24:59] now. It don't seem like it would be that
[2:25:01] but it's God's way of doing things. He
[2:25:05] lets us hit the river to see what we'll
[2:25:08] do.
[2:25:11] Now ponder that for a moment because so
[2:25:14] many times we feel like we're just going
[2:25:16] through disappointments. Life is just a
[2:25:18] disappointment.
[2:25:20] And here the prophet of God is bringing
[2:25:23] our vision into focus
[2:25:26] and he's actually saying no it's it's
[2:25:28] actually not that way at all. But if
[2:25:31] you've got a Christ centered life
[2:25:35] if you've got a Christ centered life
[2:25:37] then those disappointments are actually
[2:25:40] God's divine will
[2:25:43] happening in your life.
[2:25:47] He let you hit the river to see what
[2:25:50] you'll do about it. To see what we'll
[2:25:53] do. Moses led the children of Israel
[2:25:55] right in the path of duty and Pharaoh's
[2:25:58] army behind him. And the dust boiling
[2:26:00] from a half a million men in arms. And
[2:26:02] here was two million helpless Jews with
[2:26:04] nothing standing there, men, women,
[2:26:06] children, and so forth. And the Red Sea
[2:26:09] had them cut off. The Dead Sea had them
[2:26:10] cut off. There's no place to go. But
[2:26:12] Moses had a V-Day when he prayed
[2:26:16] through.
[2:26:18] The prophet of God begins to tell us
[2:26:20] about a a sister that precious sister.
[2:26:26] He says, you know, she would come to the
[2:26:27] altar and
[2:26:30] says, "I prayed for her. I prayed for
[2:26:33] her many times and she she would come to
[2:26:35] the altar and she'd cry and oh, she
[2:26:37] would get emotional.
[2:26:40] The tears would flow and she would just
[2:26:43] scream and holler and cry, but she'd get
[2:26:47] up and she'd still smoke.
[2:26:50] She'd come to Brother Brandham and say,
[2:26:52] "Brother Bradom, I I just don't know
[2:26:54] what to do. I I just can't get over it.
[2:26:56] I I can't get beyond it."
[2:27:01] Brother Bradam says, you know, he says,
[2:27:03] "You just got to says, you got to just
[2:27:06] get down to business with God.
[2:27:10] The anointing, the prophet of God said
[2:27:12] would say the anointing is not an
[2:27:13] emotion. The anointing is knowing how
[2:27:16] and when.
[2:27:19] It's knowing what to do to lay hold of
[2:27:23] the promises of God and say, "God, you
[2:27:26] promised."
[2:27:27] And stay right there and say, "God,
[2:27:30] you promised it. It's my promise."
[2:27:33] Brother Random says that he come to her
[2:27:35] and says now sister says you've got
[2:27:37] something like you've you've got some
[2:27:39] trouble waters ahead of you. She came
[2:27:42] down with cancer.
[2:27:45] Doctor gave her up said there's no
[2:27:48] nothing we can do about it.
[2:27:51] Brother Brandham says then she really
[2:27:52] got down to business with God.
[2:27:57] said, "Then she began to cry out to God
[2:27:59] and
[2:28:01] and God came down and delivered her from
[2:28:03] cancer and delivered her from smoking
[2:28:07] those cigarettes and the desire." See,
[2:28:10] the prophet of God says,
[2:28:13] "It's faith that overcomes."
[2:28:16] Why did it overcome? When I was praying
[2:28:18] for her here, she was just fluttering
[2:28:20] around.
[2:28:22] But when the doctor says you got cancer
[2:28:24] and going to die, she got to business.
[2:28:27] That's the way it has to get when you
[2:28:29] get to business.
[2:28:31] Why wait that long?
[2:28:34] Why not get down to business now? Put
[2:28:36] your faith in God.
[2:28:38] What if a woman had her faith in me? It
[2:28:41] have failed because I'm a man. But when
[2:28:43] she changed her faith, not in the
[2:28:45] Brandham Tabernacle or William Brandom
[2:28:47] or anyone else, but placed her faith in
[2:28:49] Jesus Christ, then she got faith.
[2:28:52] She raised up above all the fears and
[2:28:54] doubts and God healed her. She overcame.
[2:28:59] Faith is the victory that overcomes.
[2:29:03] Abraham says, "I've wondered
[2:29:06] what does Christians want to flusterate
[2:29:08] themselves with them things anyhow?"
[2:29:11] And he would go on down and say, "Why?
[2:29:13] Why does people just want to drift
[2:29:15] around?
[2:29:17] Why? When,
[2:29:20] and I'm just going to say it like this,
[2:29:23] when God has sent us a vindicated word
[2:29:26] and has led us to believe for all
[2:29:28] things,
[2:29:30] you know what the prophet of God would
[2:29:31] say? It says, "Get some ambition about
[2:29:33] you.
[2:29:35] Set your goal in Christ
[2:29:38] and quit tingling with the world."
[2:29:42] I don't know why the Lord led me this
[2:29:44] direction.
[2:29:46] a very
[2:29:48] simple
[2:29:50] message
[2:29:53] when there's great things that we could
[2:29:55] preach and great revelations and
[2:30:00] we're very well-versed in the message.
[2:30:05] But maybe God is speaking to just a
[2:30:07] heart
[2:30:09] that's saying, "Why flusterate yourself
[2:30:11] with the things of the world?
[2:30:15] Why why frustrate yourself
[2:30:18] with things that is taking your joy?
[2:30:24] Find yourself without any peace,
[2:30:27] finding yourself without any purpose to
[2:30:29] live
[2:30:32] and just trying to just trying to get
[2:30:35] through life.
[2:30:37] When God has called us to be overcomers,
[2:30:40] we are conquerors.
[2:30:43] But I believe that I'm speaking to a
[2:30:45] people who is the fulfillment of
[2:30:48] scripture that my people
[2:30:52] shall be willing in the day of my power.
[2:30:55] Why just float around?
[2:30:58] Floating around wondering, does God
[2:31:01] care? Does he love me? Is he even real?
[2:31:07] just always wishing, hoping, so
[2:31:10] discontented with life.
[2:31:13] Young person, why be discontented with
[2:31:15] life
[2:31:17] when the pis when the when the when the
[2:31:20] heavens are open, the skies are full of
[2:31:23] the Pentecostal blessings?
[2:31:26] Why tried to find pleasures in the
[2:31:30] garlics and leaks of the world?
[2:31:35] young girls trying to find
[2:31:38] their happiness in a in a man that's got
[2:31:41] a flare of the world on them. Why go
[2:31:43] after that when God's got a real Holy
[2:31:46] Ghost character that can protect you,
[2:31:49] lead you,
[2:31:51] take you into the paths of
[2:31:53] righteousness?
[2:31:55] Boys trying to look at
[2:31:58] half-dressed women
[2:32:01] saying, "That's beauty.
[2:32:04] That's nothing but the stench of hell.
[2:32:08] And if you follow that, it'll take you
[2:32:11] it'll take your soul to hell.
[2:32:18] Have a greater ambition about you.
[2:32:23] I think I I think that it it may even
[2:32:26] actually go for us elders.
[2:32:30] I I I think that we've been teaching it
[2:32:32] to the young people. I know it's been
[2:32:35] taught. I've heard it. Avoid the very
[2:32:38] appearance of evil.
[2:32:40] I know that there's even been business
[2:32:42] deals that have been cancelled and
[2:32:44] different things because of that
[2:32:45] scripture.
[2:32:48] But I think that we should take it to
[2:32:50] heart. We should come back to a real
[2:32:52] basics elementary faith
[2:32:56] to avoid the very appearance of evil.
[2:33:00] Why don't why don't we set back and look
[2:33:03] and see where our decisions are taking
[2:33:05] us?
[2:33:08] Is the Holy Ghost pleased with certain
[2:33:10] decisions and directions? And are are we
[2:33:14] living above reproach?
[2:33:18] What about these young people? Are we
[2:33:20] living above reproach?
[2:33:23] You see, we've got a greater ambition
[2:33:25] than this.
[2:33:29] It's a greater ambition than just going
[2:33:31] to Sonic to get a cherry limeade.
[2:33:37] I love coming to Pawne so I can get a
[2:33:38] limeade. My wife got me one this
[2:33:40] morning.
[2:33:44] Do do you realize how many people are
[2:33:47] fighting nervousness because there's
[2:33:49] things that are weighed down in their
[2:33:51] spirits
[2:33:53] and they won't deal with it.
[2:34:00] Oh, if I lived in the prophet, if I
[2:34:02] could just end the words here.
[2:34:05] But the problem of it is there's not a
[2:34:08] spontaneous reaction.
[2:34:12] when we know that there may be areas
[2:34:15] that we need to deal with that we need
[2:34:17] to take our wife aside and say, "Honey,
[2:34:21] I'm sorry."
[2:34:24] We need to actually go to another
[2:34:25] brother or another sister.
[2:34:28] We need to come to a real Holy Ghost
[2:34:32] spirit,
[2:34:34] a spirit sense, a spirit touch.
[2:34:38] Maybe we can
[2:34:40] just lay everything aside,
[2:34:43] not patch things up,
[2:34:46] but allow the surgeon's knife to really
[2:34:50] get down into our hearts.
[2:34:52] Mom and Daddy, do you realize your
[2:34:54] children are watching you?
[2:34:58] I I I'm I'm telling you right now, I
[2:35:01] don't have a vendetta,
[2:35:06] but something in my heart spoke to me.
[2:35:10] couldn't hardly sleep last night. Said,
[2:35:12] "Preach this.
[2:35:18] I'm one of you.
[2:35:20] I grew up here.
[2:35:22] Cut my teeth preaching to you.
[2:35:26] I love you with all my heart."
[2:35:31] But I say, "Men,
[2:35:33] let's be Holy Ghost men.
[2:35:38] Let's be what God called us to be.
[2:35:41] Women, sisters, let's be Holy Ghost
[2:35:44] sisters, Holy Ghost moms, Holy Ghost,
[2:35:49] children.
[2:35:52] You can't go to heaven just because mom
[2:35:54] and daddy's got the Holy Ghost. You've
[2:35:57] got to have the Holy Ghost.
[2:36:00] It's more there's more ambition than
[2:36:02] just coming and sitting on this. Even
[2:36:04] though you look beautiful, wonderful,
[2:36:06] handsome,
[2:36:08] but there's got to be a real something
[2:36:10] that come that when you come to the
[2:36:12] church, say, "God,
[2:36:15] I want to meet you."
[2:36:17] When you go into your bedroom, I
[2:36:20] remember
[2:36:22] just being a 12year-old
[2:36:25] kid
[2:36:28] going to my mama say, "Mama, I want what
[2:36:32] you've got.
[2:36:35] And mama prayed with me and I gave my
[2:36:37] heart to the Lord.
[2:36:39] God changed my life. Have I had
[2:36:42] struggles?
[2:36:44] A lot of a lot of things I've had to
[2:36:47] overcome.
[2:36:49] Have I been down for the count? A lot of
[2:36:51] times there's been a lot of times I
[2:36:53] thought I'd never get back up, but I'm
[2:36:56] here by the grace of God.
[2:36:59] But that's the thing.
[2:37:02] Look around you. You've got elders here
[2:37:05] that has been down for the count
[2:37:08] many a times,
[2:37:10] but they're here by the grace of God.
[2:37:13] It's not by their own powers. It's not
[2:37:15] by their own mind, but it's by the
[2:37:17] spirit of the living God.
[2:37:22] I wonder if we could just
[2:37:28] There's a song, Sister Mary. The Lord is
[2:37:31] my shepherd.
[2:37:32] The Lord is my shepher.
[2:37:36] I think it's The Lord is my shepher.
[2:37:44] He goes before
[2:37:47] me.
[2:37:50] defender behind
[2:37:53] me.
[2:37:56] [Music]
[2:37:59] I won't fear.
[2:38:06] I'm filled with anointing.
[2:38:13] [Music]
[2:38:15] My cups overflowing.
[2:38:23] No weapon can harm me.
[2:38:32] I won't
[2:38:35] fear.
[2:38:36] [Music]
[2:38:41] Oh hallelu
[2:38:47] I am not alone.
[2:38:58] Oh, he's my comfort.
[2:39:04] All
[2:39:06] holds me close.
[2:39:13] Oh,
[2:39:16] hallelujah.
[2:39:18] [Music]
[2:39:20] I am not
[2:39:24] Lord.
[2:39:28] [Music]
[2:39:30] Oh,
[2:39:32] he's my comfort.
[2:39:38] I believe that the Holy Spirit
[2:39:42] wants to let you know this morning that
[2:39:44] you're not alone,
[2:39:46] that he cares for you,
[2:39:49] that he's your protector,
[2:39:54] that he's the answer.
[2:39:57] He's the answer for the situation that
[2:40:00] you're in.
[2:40:02] Maybe the struggles of life. You're not
[2:40:05] forsaken.
[2:40:06] You're not forgotten.
[2:40:10] I believe if you come and mean business
[2:40:13] with God, I go I I just believe I've
[2:40:16] seen it too many times. God will mean
[2:40:19] business with you.
[2:40:23] I believe in the power of the gospel,
[2:40:26] [Music]
[2:40:28] the creative power
[2:40:31] to change lives and change hearts and
[2:40:34] make a new creation.
[2:40:40] I believe that
[2:40:43] if we could just lay down our our
[2:40:45] hearts, every single one of us, and say,
[2:40:47] "Lord,
[2:40:49] just meet me. Just meet me this morning.
[2:40:53] I want to overcome.
[2:40:58] This is our victory. This is my victory.
[2:41:00] I know it, Lord. It's my faith. You
[2:41:04] can't work faith, friends. You can't
[2:41:06] work it up.
[2:41:08] Faith is not an emotion.
[2:41:12] Faith is not something that you can
[2:41:14] manufacture.
[2:41:15] [Music]
[2:41:16] Faith is the gift of God in your life.
[2:41:22] I believe that if you just begin to
[2:41:25] surrender and say, "Lord, help me."
[2:41:28] Maybe you feel like you're perishing,
[2:41:29] maybe you feel like you're sinking,
[2:41:31] maybe you've got your eyes out of focus,
[2:41:34] got your eyes off of Jesus Christ. Why
[2:41:37] don't you get back into focus? Get your
[2:41:39] eyes back upon him and say, "Lord, help
[2:41:41] me."
[2:41:44] Let the surgeon's knife just begin to
[2:41:47] cuddle cut some things out maybe to say,
[2:41:51] "Lord, here I am. Why don't you break
[2:41:53] through?
[2:41:57] You can you can do it right where you're
[2:41:59] sitting. You can come up. It doesn't
[2:42:02] matter.
[2:42:04] The altar's open.
[2:42:06] You can join those that are here
[2:42:10] or right where you're at. But the
[2:42:12] important thing is is that you believe.
[2:42:15] Say, "Lord, I'm being spontaneous.
[2:42:21] Lord, I receive it.
[2:42:23] I accept it.
[2:42:26] I believe it's for me. I I believe that
[2:42:29] this is a cycle breaking gospel.
[2:42:33] I believe that the Holy Ghost is for me.
[2:42:35] I I believe that a fresh visitation of
[2:42:39] your presence is for me. Forgive
[2:42:44] me, Lord.
[2:42:47] Forgive me, Father, for
[2:42:50] getting on the devil's ground. Forgive
[2:42:52] me for getting over not avoiding the
[2:42:55] very appearance of evil. Oh, forgive me,
[2:42:57] Lord.
[2:43:01] Why don't you come and just take those
[2:43:03] habits and take those those things that
[2:43:07] maybe it seems like you can't get over.
[2:43:09] Why don't you bring it to this altar and
[2:43:11] just lay it there and say, "Lord, I give
[2:43:14] it up. I'm tired of trying. I'm I'm

[3:01:17] dedication
[3:01:19] to my Lord.
[3:01:22] [Music]
[3:01:27] This whole world
[3:01:30] [Music]
[3:01:31] of sin and heat,
[3:01:36] it has lost
[3:01:38] its hold
[3:01:40] on me.
[3:01:42] I've made a new
[3:01:46] dedication
[3:01:51] to my Lord.
[3:01:54] Made a dedication to his word. I've made
[3:01:58] a new
[3:02:01] dedication
[3:02:05] to God's word.
[3:02:08] Oh, I want to line everything up with
[3:02:11] you, Lord. I've made a new
[3:02:17] dedication
[3:02:20] to God's word.
[3:02:26] Oh,
[3:02:28] this soul's world
[3:02:31] of sin
[3:02:33] and evil.
[3:02:36] It has lost
[3:02:38] its hold
[3:02:40] on me.
[3:02:42] I've made a new
[3:02:47] dedication
[3:02:50] to God's word.
[3:02:55] Hallelujah.
[3:02:58] Making that dedication to the Lord.
[3:03:04] As brother Jonathan was saying,
[3:03:07] allowing sin
[3:03:09] or allowing iniquities is or is or
[3:03:13] things that we
[3:03:15] that we know
[3:03:17] that we shouldn't do should do and we
[3:03:20] don't do or we know that we shouldn't do
[3:03:23] and we do do.
[3:03:25] And those little things like that can
[3:03:27] can can leave little marks on your
[3:03:30] spirit
[3:03:32] where it doesn't let you go freely.
[3:03:35] And it and it keeps you it keeps you
[3:03:40] locked in to where you can't go any
[3:03:41] further with God.
[3:03:44] And Satan knows that.
[3:03:48] They're like leans upon your spirit.
[3:03:50] It's it's
[3:03:52] when you go to pray or you go to
[3:03:54] dedicate, you go to pray for somebody
[3:03:57] else and then then Satan brings these
[3:04:01] little things up to you and then you
[3:04:03] you're thinking, well,
[3:04:07] and that's the reason why we have to
[3:04:09] deal with those things with we if we've
[3:04:11] got the blood of Jesus, we know the
[3:04:14] blood is there. We know the word is
[3:04:16] powerful.
[3:04:18] But in the day of God's power, we've got
[3:04:21] to be willing. And brother Jonathan, I
[3:04:23] appreciate him dealing with that because
[3:04:25] we've got to be willing in the day of
[3:04:27] his power to say, "All right,
[3:04:32] I I'm I'm going to cut this thing out of
[3:04:34] my life.
[3:04:36] I'm going to ask God for his grace. I
[3:04:38] need grace to cut this out of my life
[3:04:42] because the word is here and the blood
[3:04:45] is real.
[3:04:50] because we are a people of of divine
[3:04:53] faith. The divine promises are ours.
[3:04:57] So today,
[3:05:01] anything, any vibration in your soul,
[3:05:03] anything that that that would when you
[3:05:06] go to pray or you go now, Satan's going
[3:05:09] to do things and and and as the Apostle
[3:05:12] Peter says, blessed are you
[3:05:16] when men shall revive revile you for
[3:05:19] good's sake.
[3:05:21] So So Satan's going to be there to
[3:05:23] accuse you.
[3:05:25] If it's under the blood and you've got
[3:05:27] it taken care of and you've you've you
[3:05:29] you've cut that sin out in your life,
[3:05:31] that's well, you just go on and say,
[3:05:34] "Satan, you don't have a hold." But if
[3:05:36] Satan knows he has a hold on us, there's
[3:05:39] where he will he will he'll just keep
[3:05:42] poking and poking and poking.
[3:05:45] But I'm saying we leave here this
[3:05:47] morning and don't give him no room to
[3:05:49] poke. Oh, he can. He But when it's dealt
[3:05:52] with, it's under the blood. It's taken
[3:05:54] care of. We can walk outside these doors
[3:05:56] and say, "Satan, you don't have a you
[3:05:59] don't have a a right. I I I don't you
[3:06:01] don't have a hold on me. You have no
[3:06:04] authority over me."
[3:06:06] And then your faith is just as unlimited
[3:06:09] as God is.
[3:06:11] Then
[3:06:13] all things are possible with God and all
[3:06:17] things are possible with him that
[3:06:18] believes.
[3:06:20] Isn't that incredible?
[3:06:23] I'm thankful for that kind of faith.
[3:06:27] I'm thankful for that we can push the
[3:06:30] reset button.
[3:06:32] I'm thankful that the blood of Jesus is
[3:06:34] right there as as our brother Jonathan
[3:06:36] was saying,
[3:06:38] Satan is there to do the condemning
[3:06:41] and to bring misery and but God's there
[3:06:45] to bring redemption,
[3:06:48] bring victory, love, joy, peace, and
[3:06:50] righteousness in the Holy Ghost.
[3:06:53] I'm thankful for that. Amen.
[3:06:57] Going to leave them there.
[3:07:02] [Music]
[3:07:04] Going to leave them there.
[3:07:11] Going to take my burdens
[3:07:16] to the Lord and leave them there.
[3:07:23] That's what we're doing.
[3:07:26] If I trust and never
[3:07:33] God will surely
[3:07:36] bring me out.
[3:07:39] Take my burdens
[3:07:43] to the Lord.
[3:07:46] Leave them there. Oh, let's sing it one
[3:07:50] more time. I'm going to leave them
[3:07:54] there.
[3:07:59] I'm going to leave them there.
[3:08:06] Going to take my burdens
[3:08:10] to my Lord.
[3:08:14] Leave them there.
[3:08:20] Oh, if I trust
[3:08:26] Oh, God
[3:08:29] will surely
[3:08:32] [Music]
[3:08:34] take my burdens
[3:08:37] to the Lord
[3:08:40] and leave
[3:08:43] them there.
[3:08:44] [Music]
[3:08:47] Can I hear a great big amen?
[3:08:51] Satan has no authority over me because
[3:08:56] the blood, once the blood has been
[3:08:59] applied to a heart that has come with
[3:09:02] the willing heart to leave it all
[3:09:04] behind, there is nothing Satan can do to
[3:09:08] hinder that man from his God.
[3:09:11] That's right.
[3:09:13] That's right. Hallelujah.
[3:09:17] I'm saying you can be guilty right now
[3:09:20] and repent with a humble heart before
[3:09:23] God. Two minutes later, the authority
[3:09:27] and the power of God is with you. We're
[3:09:29] not Catholics. You don't earn anything.
[3:09:32] You get rid of sin and the blood is the
[3:09:36] only way to do it. We get rid of sin and
[3:09:39] we walk with God. Amen. And aren't you
[3:09:42] glad for a great God who loves us?
[3:09:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:09:49] Praise the Lord. I thoroughly enjoyed
[3:09:52] the message this morning.
[3:09:55] Needed that message this morning.
[3:10:04] And um and I I'm I'm want to apply that
[3:10:08] to my life. And we've got we've got
