[48:50] you to the end of the world Amen as as
[48:54] Moses brother Branham would tell us as
[48:56] Moses was setting the the church in
[48:59] order as as each of the tribes we're
[49:02] told to pick up a stone as they were as
[49:05] they were going across the Jordan River
[49:07] that God had so supernaturally opened up
[49:10] and he told him he said now I want you
[49:12] to take a stone per tribe and I want you
[49:15] to bring over here and set it on Amen
[49:17] and and build a memorial a memorial of
[49:21] what uh God has done for you this day a
[49:25] memorial of God's delivering power a

[49:51] in order he was doing it God's provided
[49:54] way and he went and got a stone for each
[49:57] tribe of Israel and you know hey what's
[49:59] the matter today we try to roll up a
[50:02] Pentecostal Stone and say this is it and
[50:04] the methodists roll up a stone and say
[50:06] this is it but God wants us to roll them
[50:10] everyone together and have an
[50:12] old-fashioned Holy Ghost pouring out on
[50:16] the whole church everywhere oh brother
[50:18] did you ever did that go home I felt
[50:21] that yes sir that's what we need today
[50:24] brother is bring every believer together

[57:56] it's not just a one-sided deal to where
[57:58] you're a man of eye everyone else sees a
[58:01] seal but on the inside you're lacking
[58:03] faith and you're lacking confidence and
[58:05] you're lacking power he says you're
[58:06] going to see it inside and outside amen
[58:09] matters in fact the scripture that old

[58:48] talking about her satisfaction now he's
[58:50] our comforter in whom they're they're in

[58:56] nevertheless I tell you the truth it is
[58:58] expedient for you that I go away for I
[59:01] go not away for if I go not away the
[59:04] comforter will not come to you but if I
[59:07] depart I will send him unto you and then
[59:12] he turns right around in another verse
[59:14] down and he says I will come unto you
[59:18] Amen brother Bradham says he's our
[59:20] advocate amen he's our attorney he's one
[59:24] that is pleading amen the case for

[1:00:08] 28 says he is our rest amen the
[1:00:12] scripture says he is our promise amen it
[1:00:16] causes the word to go into action in
[1:00:21] your life half the Holy Spirit brings
[1:00:25] satisfaction amen the unction of the
[1:00:29] Holy One now
[1:00:30] they're they're in in first John 2 and
[1:00:33] 19. and a man is breaking a distinction
[1:00:36] between those who didn't have the Holy
[1:00:39] Spirit and those that did he says they
[1:00:41] went out from us but they were not of us
[1:00:43] for if they had been of us they would no
[1:00:46] doubt have continued with us but they
[1:00:48] went out that they might be made
[1:00:49] manifest that they were not of us but ye
[1:00:53] have an unction
[1:00:55] you have an unction from the Holy One
[1:00:58] and you know all things can you say Amen
[1:01:01] what is that unction it is the authority
[1:01:04] to use the word it's the authority to
[1:01:07] believe the word amen you know I I say
[1:01:10] you know we don't speak too much on the
[1:01:12] Holy Ghost as far as the importance of
[1:01:14] of receiving it but Jesus said amen that
[1:01:18] we should he told the uh the disciples
[1:01:20] he says go to Jerusalem and stay there
[1:01:24] in Jerusalem until you be endued with
[1:01:30] that power from on high
[1:01:33] amen Jesus told him and you will become
[1:01:37] Witnesses unto me
[1:01:40] amen now now he's saying nah amen I want
[1:01:44] you to stay there stay there stay there
[1:01:45] until you get that unction because it's
[1:01:47] the stay in power it's the grit power
[1:01:49] amen it's the anointing that that breaks
[1:01:52] the Yokes amen it's the power of God
[1:01:55] unto salvation brother random says now
[1:01:57] you you you we've been taught a lot amen

[1:02:04] the Dynamics we're missing we're we're
[1:02:07] missing the Dynamics we don't put enough
[1:02:09] stress on the Dynamics and I say there's
[1:02:12] where we lose our joy is because the
[1:02:15] Dynamics the Holy Spirit isn't there and
[1:02:19] it's not our satisfying portion as it
[1:02:22] should

[1:03:43] man brother Bradham says now the word is
[1:03:45] God
[1:03:45] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:03:47] was with God the Word was God
[1:03:49] and then Jesus said if you abide in me
[1:03:51] and my word in you you ask what you will
[1:03:55] and it'll be done for you
[1:03:56] that's staying with Christ in his word
[1:03:59] don't go right or left stay right with
[1:04:01] it see and then it's actually not your
[1:04:04] word then it's his word and his word has
[1:04:07] the power and the authority behind it
[1:04:10] now if the Holy Spirit which is God's
[1:04:13] word amen or the power of God's word

[1:04:43] gospel no man has a right to preach the
[1:04:46] gospel without the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:48] Ghost Peter or Jesus would not let Peter
[1:04:51] James and John or any of the rest of
[1:04:53] them preach the gospel until they waited
[1:04:55] in the city of Jerusalem until of the

[1:06:39] God one day this runaway Prophet on the
[1:06:42] backside of the desert amen he he really
[1:06:45] come on them sacred sounds Sands to
[1:06:48] where every Minister ought to come amen

[1:06:53] got a professor of college or whatever
[1:06:56] he may be he has no business behind the
[1:06:59] pulpit until first he's caught on that
[1:07:02] sacred sand between him and God Alone
[1:07:05] amen that he's that he's got an
[1:07:07] experience with god with no scientist in
[1:07:10] the world could ever hammer away from
[1:07:12] him they can take that word and cut it
[1:07:14] any way they want to and the devil uses
[1:07:17] the word and he proved it he uses the
[1:07:19] word cut out his own program but when

[1:07:25] back there on them sacred Sands where
[1:07:29] nothing but you and God Alone can stand
[1:07:33] all the scientists in the world couldn't
[1:07:35] take it away from you because you were
[1:07:38] there and you met God and you know what
[1:07:42] happened
[1:07:43] can you say man
[1:07:45] Emmanuel's old the the the the old
[1:07:49] church the first church was such a
[1:07:51] powerful force amen they were they were
[1:07:55] so powerful until a man their speech was
[1:07:59] changed their attitudes was changed
[1:08:01] their amen they had something that the
[1:08:04] world needed and they weren't ashamed of
[1:08:06] the Gospel anymore
[1:08:09] I think sometimes he mind we we we we
[1:08:12] allow a man a a a real a real damning
[1:08:18] Rock they Mountain to be put over that
[1:08:21] gusher we we allow Hallelujah amount
[1:08:24] that Spirit of being ashamed that that
[1:08:28] Spirit of a man of well I I'm ashamed I
[1:08:31] I don't I I don't know what they'll
[1:08:34] think of me I don't know what they'll
[1:08:35] amen but Peter and John and the rest of
[1:08:38] them that that were in the upper room
[1:08:40] they were ashamed too amen they were
[1:08:42] ashamed they they they didn't want to
[1:08:44] tell anybody that Jesus raised from the
[1:08:46] dead amen because they they there was a
[1:08:49] lot of critics out there I want to say
[1:08:51] tonight I want so full of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:54] that I can tell the world what has taken
[1:08:58] place in this day
[1:09:00] I I want to be so full well praise the
[1:09:03] Lord I've heard people say well I don't
[1:09:05] say much to anybody because I I just
[1:09:07] don't want it to come back on them
[1:09:09] because once they know amen that oh my
[1:09:11] and I I I I'm looking at that and I'm
[1:09:13] thinking I don't really understand that
[1:09:15] the Bible says go into all the world and
[1:09:18] share this gospel share what you've got
[1:09:21] I don't think we should be ashamed of
[1:09:23] this message I don't think we should be
[1:09:25] ashamed of our Prophet I don't think we
[1:09:27] should be ashamed amen but what we need
[1:09:29] is a good old-fashioned a baptism of the
[1:09:31] Holy Ghost and power to make this thing
[1:09:34] live in me again
[1:09:36] hallelujah amen it's hard to really say
[1:09:39] much about it when you're not on fire
[1:09:41] about it it's hard when you've lost your
[1:09:43] passion you don't want to talk about it
[1:09:45] but if you can ever get refilled with
[1:09:47] the Holy Ghost you say
[1:09:50] we need to be revealed I think it's
[1:09:53] filling up on top of feeling and
[1:09:55] refilling upon top of refilling can you
[1:09:57] say Amen they were filled with the Holy
[1:09:59] Ghost in Acts 2 and they were already
[1:10:01] seeking for the Holy Ghost in Acts 4.
[1:10:03] what I'm saying is is God I want that
[1:10:07] satisfaction again I want to sit there
[1:10:10] in the middle of your spirit feel the
[1:10:13] joy amen feel your power I want to know
[1:10:16] that I know I want there to be a passion
[1:10:19] about this in my heart once again
[1:10:23] can you say ma'am
[1:10:26] Peter James and John and like the rest
[1:10:29] of them were fearful
[1:10:30] what will the people think Hallelujah
[1:10:33] amen
[1:10:35] what if they don't agree with what I'm
[1:10:37] telling them amen
[1:10:39] did Jesus really indeed raise from the
[1:10:41] dead and they remind him what is he what
[1:10:44] are they going to say when we say that
[1:10:45] he appeared to us as disciples amen
[1:10:49] hallelujah brother says that's a as they
[1:10:51] sat there
[1:10:52] as they sit there and and maybe Peter
[1:10:56] was looking out the window
[1:10:57] and he and he started looking out there
[1:10:59] and the man and he saw Dr Jones out
[1:11:02] there in your mind and and uh he man and
[1:11:07] and and he was he was uh
[1:11:10] brother Branham says that Iman he was
[1:11:13] scared and he was cowardly and and he
[1:11:16] says now what if Dr so and so don't
[1:11:18] understand
[1:11:19] any man and he and and and and these
[1:11:22] disciples were all out there in in that
[1:11:25] upper room I mean man they weren't there

[1:11:36] they were there under a promise they
[1:11:39] were there under a promise you just wait
[1:11:40] until the power comes and so they're
[1:11:42] waiting for the power of God to come but
[1:11:44] they're still nervous about the deal and
[1:11:46] amen but oh brother amen and I think
[1:11:50] that's the way it can be sometimes today
[1:11:52] amen we we we can we can look around and
[1:11:56] amen and we're cowardly with our

[1:12:00] healed us amen what what if God what if
[1:12:03] what if what if the sickness comes back
[1:12:05] or even then they'll think that you know
[1:12:07] that that I didn't have faith or uh
[1:12:10] and we're we're cowardly to share what

[1:26:21] Jesus called Christ
[1:26:23] brother Branham says the Dynamics
[1:26:25] of this church
[1:26:27] will be a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:31] that we have worked in small measure
[1:26:34] while The Headstone is coming down to
[1:26:36] unite with the body
[1:26:38] but when the head and body unites
[1:26:40] together the full power of the Holy
[1:26:42] Ghost
[1:26:43] raise her up just exactly like that
[1:26:46] even the dead that's dead in Christ for
[1:26:49] hundreds of years will rise in the
[1:26:52] beauty of his Holiness and take a flight
[1:26:54] to the skies
[1:26:56] he says the Dynamics is the Holy Ghost
[1:27:01] Hallelujah is I like to liken it because
[1:27:05] it in in Pentecost it brought back not a
[1:27:08] green leaf but a tussle amen he says but
[1:27:12] the corn cannot say to the tassel uh uh
[1:27:15] or not not a green leaf not a tassel but
[1:27:19] the corn cannot say to the tassel I have
[1:27:20] no need of you or that also can't say to
[1:27:22] the leaf I have no use for you because
[1:27:25] of the same life that was in the leaf
[1:27:26] made the tussle the same life was in the
[1:27:29] tall so it made the ear it was a
[1:27:31] Lutheran Church that made the Wesley it
[1:27:33] was the Wesley church that made the
[1:27:35] Pentecost but Pentecost is what it's a
[1:27:37] restoration of the same kind of grain
[1:27:39] that went into the ground in the
[1:27:40] beginning bringing back all the fullness
[1:27:42] of the power of Pentecost by the baptism
[1:27:45] of the Holy Ghost in the last days oh
[1:27:47] it's a great thing to believe to look at
[1:27:48] it now in this age that we're living in
[1:27:50] this age is beyond Pentecost Pentecost
[1:27:53] has settle down into organizations and
[1:27:55] started faking a whole lot about

[1:28:03] help it it's nature they'll do that amen
[1:28:06] it's the plan for them to do that but
[1:28:08] the church has moved on
[1:28:10] it's going into greater more powerful
[1:28:13] the restoration of the gifts many many
[1:28:16] Pentecostal uh people does not even
[1:28:18] believe in Divine Healing Ministry of
[1:28:20] angels powers of God many Pentecostals
[1:28:23] cause these Visions I see the devil many
[1:28:25] organizations won't even have nothing to
[1:28:26] do with it now in Pentecost see we've
[1:28:29] moved beyond that we're just as
[1:28:31] methodists called for Pentecostal crazy
[1:28:33] for speaking in tongues just as Luther
[1:28:35] called Methodist crazy for shouting but
[1:28:37] it'll all come forth of the Holy Spirit
