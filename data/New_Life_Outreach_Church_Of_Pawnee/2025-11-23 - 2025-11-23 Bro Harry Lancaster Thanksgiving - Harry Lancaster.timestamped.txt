[17:54] [music]
[17:58] Let's just go before the Lord.
[18:02] Lord Jesus, we come into your presence
[18:03] this evening, Lord. And Lord, we just
[18:06] thank you for allowing us to to gather
[18:08] here once more, Lord. Lord, you've given
[18:11] us a a wonderful day together, Lord. And
[18:13] [music] you've allowed us to come into
[18:15] your presence once more, Lord. And Lord,
[18:17] we just want to come with that spirit of
[18:20] thanksgiving, Lord, and thankfulness,
[18:21] Lord, just [music] to worship you and
[18:23] praise you for all that you've done for
[18:25] us, Lord. And Lord, I pray that you
[18:28] would be in our time together this
[18:29] evening, Lord, as Lord, I would speak a
[18:31] few words and we would [music] spend
[18:33] some time
[18:35] worshiping and and offering testimonies,
[18:39] Lord. Just Lord, be in everything that
[18:41] it's said and done, Lord. May it just be
[18:42] pleasing to you, Lord. Lord, I pray that
[18:45] you would give me the right words to
[18:48] speak, Lord. That you would just [music]
[18:50] take control, Lord. You,
[18:53] Lord, may you use this vessel, Lord,
[18:56] that Lord, maybe I'm not feeling the
[18:59] best this evening, Lord, but Lord, you
[19:01] can take control. You can be the one to
[19:04] to guide every word, Lord, to make sure
[19:06] that what needs to be said is said,
[19:09] Lord. And Lord, I pray that you would
[19:11] just bless your people this evening,
[19:12] Lord. Lord, we just commit the service
[19:14] into your hands. The name of Lord Jesus
[19:16] Christ, we pray. Amen.
[19:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:21] &gt;&gt; Let's all take out our Bibles and we'll
[19:22] turn to Acts chapter 17.
[19:36] I was telling brother Wendell earlier
[19:38] that I don't know what I did if I just
[19:42] slept wrong or whatever but my
[19:47] back decided to act up today
[19:51] and I have already decided if necessary
[19:54] I will just sit down in that chair and
[19:56] keep on preaching and we'll go from
[19:57] there. Um and we will just see how how
[20:02] the Lord does it this evening. But Acts
[20:05] chapter 17,
[20:08] we'll start at verse 22.
[20:12] Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars
[20:14] Hill and said, "Ye men of Athens, I
[20:17] perceive that in all things you are too
[20:19] superstitious. For as I passed by and
[20:22] beheld your devotions, I found an altar
[20:24] with this inscription, to the unknown
[20:27] God, whom therefore you ignorantly
[20:29] worship. Him declare I unto you. God
[20:32] that made the world and all things
[20:34] therein, seeing that he is Lord of
[20:36] heavens and earth, dwelleth not in
[20:38] temples made with hands, neither is
[20:40] worshiped with men's hands, as though he
[20:42] needed anything, seeing he giveth to all
[20:44] life and breath and all things, and hath
[20:47] made of one blood all nations of men,
[20:49] for to dwell all the face of the earth,
[20:52] and hath determined the times before
[20:54] appointed, and the bounds of their
[20:55] habitation, that they should seek the
[20:58] Lord, if he happily they might feel
[21:00] after him, and find him, though he be
[21:03] not far from every one of us. For in him
[21:06] we live and move and have our beings, as
[21:10] certain also of our own poets have said,
[21:13] for we are also his offspring.
[21:16] And we'll go ahead and turn to Romans
[21:19] chapter 8.
[21:25] Very
[21:27] familiar portion of scripture. Romans
[21:29] chapter 8
[21:33] starting at verse 28.
[21:37] And we know that all things work
[21:39] together for good to them that love God,
[21:41] to them who are the called according to
[21:43] his purpose. For whom he did forno, he
[21:45] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[21:48] the image of his son, that he might be
[21:50] the firstborn among many brethren.
[21:52] Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them
[21:55] he also called. And whom he called, them
[21:58] he also justified. And whom he
[22:00] justified, them he also glorified. You
[22:03] may all have your seats.
[22:11] As Paul was talking to
[22:15] the Roman or the the Greeks at Mars
[22:17] Hill,
[22:18] &gt;&gt; yeah,
[22:18] &gt;&gt; there was one
[22:20] &gt;&gt; section that he mentioned there.
[22:24] And he said, "And hath made of one blood
[22:28] all nations of men, for to dwell on all
[22:30] the face of the earth, and hath
[22:31] determined the times before appointed,
[22:33] and the bounds of their habitation."
[22:36] So Paul is saying that every nation,
[22:39] every country, every kingdom is
[22:43] set by God.
[22:45] &gt;&gt; He's the one who says, "This is where
[22:48] you're going to go. These are going to
[22:49] be your borders. This is where you're
[22:50] going to be at." Um, and
[22:54] as we look at
[22:57] Thanksgiving and we're going into the
[22:59] the season of Thanksgiving and thinking
[23:01] about what God did to bring the pilgrims
[23:06] to this land and begin America, we can
[23:11] see that God is going through and he is
[23:13] ordering each step along the way. Okay.
[23:16] All right.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; You know, we're going to take a few
[23:18] moments and for a few minutes, we're
[23:21] going to be doing a little bit of a a
[23:22] history lesson here as we we talk about
[23:24] it. But,
[23:26] &gt;&gt; you know, when we go back, it was in the
[23:27] early 1600s
[23:30] that really the story begins. In the
[23:33] early 1600s in England, everyone was
[23:37] legally required to belong to the Church
[23:40] of England.
[23:42] &gt;&gt; In order if you refuse to attend the
[23:46] Anglican church service, if you refuse
[23:48] to if you refuse to go to church, you
[23:52] could have fines that would increase
[23:55] each time you refuse to attend.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; Wow. Brother Wendle, that might get
[23:59] people coming to church a little more
[24:00] often,
[24:02] you know, but you would get fines
[24:05] increasing every time you refuse to
[24:07] attend. You could suffer surveillance
[24:10] and harassment from authorities. You
[24:12] could face imprisonment and you could be
[24:15] labeled a religious dissenter which
[24:17] harmed your ability to work, to own
[24:19] property, and to travel. All right? Now
[24:23] the pilgrims were part of a small group
[24:25] that were known as separatists.
[24:28] So you had
[24:31] these different groups. Now you had the
[24:33] Puritans in England that they thought
[24:36] that there was a way to purify the
[24:38] church of England. There was a way to
[24:40] improve the organization that we from
[24:43] within we can somehow fix the problem.
[24:45] &gt;&gt; Okay. But the pilgrims were part of a
[24:47] small group known as separatists where
[24:49] they believed it was too corrupt to fix.
[24:53] There was no way that they could fix it.
[24:55] And so they needed to leave. They needed
[24:58] to be apart. They needed to be
[25:00] different.
[25:01] &gt;&gt; All right?
[25:01] &gt;&gt; And so they wanted to separate entirely
[25:04] and form an independent congregation
[25:07] based solely on the scriptures. Now
[25:09] obviously because the Church of England
[25:12] was the required
[25:14] belief of the time
[25:17] &gt;&gt; their decision was extremely illegal.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; It was against every law that there was,
[25:22] every guideline that they could follow.
[25:25] They were criminals the moment they
[25:27] decided
[25:28] &gt;&gt; we need to be separate from the Church
[25:31] of England.
[25:32] In fact, King James I
[25:35] saw the separatists as both religious
[25:37] rebels and political threats. He
[25:39] famously declared, "I will make them
[25:41] conform or I will harry them out of the
[25:44] land."
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Under his rule, the separatists meetings
[25:47] were often raided. The leaders were
[25:50] arrested and jailed. Homes were
[25:52] searched. People were fined into
[25:55] poverty. Some separatists were watched
[25:57] by spies or forced into hiding. and life
[26:00] in England was becoming increasingly
[26:03] dangerous for them.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Around6007
[26:08] to6008 somewhere in that timeline many
[26:11] separatists fled secretly to the
[26:14] Netherlands
[26:15] &gt;&gt; to Holland
[26:16] &gt;&gt; where religious freedom was allowed.
[26:19] Yeah.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; All right.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; You know, they settled in Leiden, a
[26:23] Dutch city that was known for its
[26:25] tolerance.
[26:27] And for the first time, they could
[26:28] worship freely without fear of arrest.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; But as they spent more time there, new
[26:37] problems began to arise
[26:39] &gt;&gt; because here they were in this country
[26:41] that was known for how it could be so
[26:45] tolerant.
[26:47] But the thing was it wasn't just
[26:49] tolerant to religion.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; It was tolerant to everything. That
[26:54] mindset of tolerance begins to spread.
[26:56] And what the pilgrims found was the
[27:00] nation tolerated all kinds of different
[27:02] sin.
[27:04] &gt;&gt; And that sin began to be attractive to
[27:07] the children that they were raising.
[27:10] where they had been in a country that
[27:14] they may have a struggle to be able to
[27:16] worship the way that they believed, they
[27:18] also weren't having to fight off a lot
[27:20] of sinful behavior
[27:22] &gt;&gt; because the entire country believed some
[27:25] form of Christianity.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; But now that they had the freedom to
[27:29] worship the the way they wanted, there
[27:32] was now because of tolerance, there was
[27:35] a lot of other things that could
[27:36] attract.
[27:38] They also began to find that the
[27:41] pilgrims
[27:42] were proud Englishmen. Even though they
[27:44] were living in Holland, they were still
[27:47] English to their roots.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; And they found that their children were
[27:51] beginning to adopt some of the
[27:54] tendencies of the nation that they were
[27:56] living in.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Okay?
[27:58] &gt;&gt; So there was spiritual temptation going
[28:01] on. they their children were beginning
[28:03] to lose their identity as Englishmen
[28:06] because they were adopting into the
[28:08] country that they were within.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; They also found most pilgrims were
[28:14] farmers or or crafts people.
[28:17] But the problem was living in Leaden
[28:19] where they were, this was a bustling
[28:22] urban industrial city.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; There wasn't really good opportunities
[28:26] for farmers or basic crafts people. All
[28:30] right.
[28:30] &gt;&gt; And so they ended up taking the
[28:34] lowest paying base level jobs that they
[28:37] could.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[28:39] &gt;&gt; In fact, in order to support their
[28:42] families and make ends meet, they even
[28:44] found that the children would end up
[28:46] going and working in ribbon factories.
[28:50] And these children and teenagers
[28:53] were beginning to age before their time,
[28:56] being bent over from the kind of work
[28:57] that they were doing
[28:59] &gt;&gt; to where physically they were beginning
[29:01] to act like they were much older.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; They lived in poverty, often struggling
[29:08] to feed their families.
[29:13] By 16 somewhere between 1617 to 1619,
[29:18] the pilgrims decided that they really
[29:22] only had three choices. They could
[29:24] either continue as they were staying in
[29:27] Holland, remaining poor, risking their
[29:30] children, continuing to drift away
[29:33] spiritually and culturally.
[29:35] &gt;&gt; They could go back to England and face
[29:38] severe persecution again.
[29:41] Or they could try traveling to a new
[29:43] land,
[29:44] &gt;&gt; looking for the opportunities that this
[29:46] would give. The opportunity to be able
[29:48] to worship God freely, to be able to
[29:50] raise their children in the English
[29:52] heritage, to be able to live according
[29:54] to the scriptures without government
[29:56] interference,
[29:58] to build a community based on Christian
[30:00] principles.
[30:01] And yes, they even talked about if you
[30:04] look at their writings, the opportunity
[30:07] to be able to minister to the people in
[30:09] the new land.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, they were going for the opportunity
[30:12] to be able to
[30:15] have their own society and worship
[30:17] freely, but they were also looking for
[30:19] that missionary opportunity to be able
[30:21] to spread the gospel,
[30:22] &gt;&gt; right?
[30:23] &gt;&gt; They weren't going and looking, hey,
[30:24] we're going to build a commune. We're
[30:25] not going to talk to anybody that's in
[30:27] this other land. But they were looking
[30:29] at as wherever we go,
[30:31] &gt;&gt; we can still be a witness.
[30:33] &gt;&gt; We can still be spreading the gospel.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; And so
[30:40] the pilgrims ended up working and making
[30:43] a deal with merchants to fund their
[30:45] journey because like I mentioned, the
[30:47] pilgrims were basically dirt poor.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; They were not working in in highpaying
[30:52] jobs. And so they needed some way to be
[30:55] able to to fund their journey. And so
[30:58] they came to a deal with these different
[31:00] merchants that the merchants would pay
[31:02] for their travel, send them over with
[31:04] supplies and everything and then they
[31:06] would pay them back. They would
[31:07] basically be indentured in some way for
[31:10] a while.
[31:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[31:13] &gt;&gt; Depending on when they were first
[31:14] negotiating, it was going to be like we
[31:16] will work four days out of the week
[31:17] basically to repay
[31:20] the merchants and then two days out of
[31:22] the week we'll be working to provide for
[31:24] ourselves and our family.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[31:28] This was not going to be a way to get
[31:31] rich,
[31:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[31:32] &gt;&gt; In fact, when you go through and you
[31:34] read some of their uh the works that
[31:37] were published from journals and things,
[31:40] they don't list that is the reason that
[31:42] they're going. They're not going they're
[31:44] not going to get land. They're not going
[31:46] for the purpose of getting wealthy and
[31:49] earning a lot of money.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; This wasn't the reason that they were
[31:53] going to a new land.
[31:55] They were going to a new land to be able
[31:58] to worship, to be able to still serve
[32:03] their king. They were going under the
[32:05] opices of England,
[32:06] &gt;&gt; right?
[32:08] &gt;&gt; They were, like I said earlier, they
[32:10] were Englishmen.
[32:12] &gt;&gt; They wanted to be Englishmen. They were
[32:13] proud to be Englishmen.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; And they were going to this other land
[32:20] to proudly represent England.
[32:24] because it also allowed them to worship
[32:26] the way that they wanted.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; They would be able to worship according
[32:29] to the scriptures and they would be able
[32:31] to raise their children within that
[32:33] environment.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; They weren't going to suddenly become
[32:38] rich and wealthy and live in the lap of
[32:42] luxury.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[32:45] &gt;&gt; So, they were able to get two ships to
[32:49] be able to travel to the Americas.
[32:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. or what would become the Americas
[32:53] to to the new land.
[32:55] &gt;&gt; They got what's called the Mayflower,
[32:58] which all of us know very well. And they
[33:00] also got the Speed Well.
[33:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Which fewer know about.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; All right.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; And they took the two ships and they
[33:08] left on their journey,
[33:11] but they kept having to stop in
[33:13] different ports because the speed well
[33:15] was leaking.
[33:17] They stopped in the first port and they
[33:19] got it fixed and then they set back on
[33:22] sail and the speed well was leaking
[33:23] again and they had to stop in a second
[33:25] port and get more repairs. And they left
[33:28] again and they had to stop in a third
[33:30] port
[33:33] because the speed well was once again
[33:35] leaking.
[33:38] Now, both ships had obviously been
[33:40] loaded with supplies and with people.
[33:43] And so those that had been traveling on
[33:45] the speed well, most of them ended up
[33:48] having to go back
[33:51] &gt;&gt; because they couldn't all get onto the
[33:53] Mayflower and it wasn't safe for the
[33:55] speed well to continue forward.
[33:58] But the Mayflower took on a few more
[34:01] people.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; It had a little bit of room that could
[34:04] work with. And then they set voyage.
[34:08] Now, the journey should have taken about
[34:10] 33 days,
[34:12] but because they encountered storms more
[34:14] than half of the time they were on the
[34:16] trip, it took them 66 days.
[34:20] So, the 33-day trip, they ended up
[34:22] having 33 days of storms, which meant
[34:25] they now had to travel 66 days because
[34:27] they were traveling so much slower.
[34:31] Ships at that time were not really used
[34:33] for transporting people,
[34:36] especially not in quantities.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; You might have one guest cabin to
[34:42] &gt;&gt; take a a couple across the
[34:45] &gt;&gt; the water to whatever nation they're
[34:47] going to, but they didn't travel in mass
[34:49] and ship.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; And so the pilgrims ended up staying in
[34:55] a space that was between the upper deck
[34:57] and the bottom hold. Those are
[34:59] approximately five feet tall.
[35:01] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; There was no standing.
[35:07] Even though most of them weren't the six
[35:10] feet tall we may consider more average
[35:12] now, they were all over five feet except
[35:14] for children.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; And so they spent the whole time either
[35:20] sitting, laying down, or hunched over.
[35:26] They
[35:28] wasn't a lot of light coming in. This
[35:30] was designed for storing
[35:33] supplies, for storing goods. This wasn't
[35:37] set up to be a guest quarters. And so,
[35:40] there weren't a lot of windows to let
[35:42] some light in. It was a very dark, dank
[35:45] area. There wasn't a lot of moving air.
[35:48] They weren't really allowed to go up on
[35:50] deck very often because they would get
[35:52] in the way of the sailors that were
[35:53] working.
[35:55] In fact, the sailors didn't like them.
[35:58] &gt;&gt; The sailors weren't happy to have all
[36:00] these people on board.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; It made their lives a lot more
[36:04] difficult.
[36:05] &gt;&gt; Transporting cargo was one thing.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Transporting people that now had other
[36:10] needs
[36:12] &gt;&gt; made it far more difficult.
[36:15] In fact, one of the things that was the
[36:18] sailor's responsibility was it was their
[36:20] job to make sure that the community
[36:23] chamber pot was emptied twice a day
[36:28] &gt;&gt; withund
[36:30] and something people on the decks. This
[36:33] did not make this an enjoyable task
[36:36] &gt;&gt; and it just gave them more reasons to
[36:39] dislike the pilgrims
[36:41] &gt;&gt; and dislike those that were traveling.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; It was dark. It was dank. It was smelly.
[36:47] They had animal animals that were down
[36:49] below them which just made the smell
[36:52] even better.
[36:56] And so they went through storm after
[36:58] storm after storm.
[37:02] I mean, I can't imagine being on a boat
[37:04] for over 30 days of storms.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; I mean, most of us think it's bad enough
[37:10] when there's a storm here on land and
[37:12] we're cooped up in our house for a
[37:14] couple days.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; It's like, it's bad enough, man. I've
[37:17] been stuck in my house for the last two,
[37:19] three days because of rain, [sighs]
[37:24] &gt;&gt; you know, and here I'm sitting in air
[37:26] conditioned comfort. There's food in my
[37:28] fridge. There's a stove to cook. There's
[37:30] a bed to lay on. There's a toilet with
[37:34] running water, you know,
[37:37] &gt;&gt; and it's so rough for us that we've been
[37:40] rained in or snowed in or whatever storm
[37:44] has kept us cooped up in the house for a
[37:46] few days,
[37:48] &gt;&gt; but yet here they are stuck on this
[37:50] ship, stuck in this five foot tall
[37:55] space.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:56] &gt;&gt; With a hundred other people. Yeah.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; For over two months.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; With half of that being in stormy
[38:07] weather.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; When they finally arrived in the new
[38:13] world and they saw the land, they
[38:17] realized that they had been driven far
[38:20] north of where they were supposed to be
[38:21] going.
[38:24] When they had set out on this journey,
[38:26] they had papers that said they were
[38:28] being given land in what, according to
[38:31] the papers, they called Virginia, but
[38:32] would have been in modern day New York
[38:35] was where they were supposed to be. They
[38:37] were supposed to go where this one river
[38:40] was. I forgot to write down which river
[38:41] it is, but this was where they were
[38:42] supposed to set up.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:45] &gt;&gt; And they realized that they were far too
[38:46] north. They were they were nowhere near
[38:48] where they were supposed to be. So, they
[38:50] tried to sail south. Oh, I'm sorry. I
[38:53] did have a written down. They were
[38:54] supposed to be where the mouth of the
[38:55] Hudson do float into the sea. And so
[38:58] they tried to sail south to get down to
[39:01] the land that they were supposed to be
[39:02] in.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; But they ended up in dangerous waters
[39:06] off the coast of Massachusetts.
[39:09] In modern day times, it's called the
[39:12] Pollock Rip, where there are more
[39:14] shipwrecks than any place else on the
[39:16] eastern seabboard.
[39:20] By God's providence, a wind came off the
[39:22] land that blew them back out to safety.
[39:25] And they came to realize, "We are never
[39:27] making it to where we're supposed to be
[39:29] at.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; We're not going to make it to the land
[39:33] that according to the paper is where
[39:34] we're supposed to be.
[39:37] &gt;&gt; Not happening.
[39:38] &gt;&gt; So, we have to go back to this other
[39:40] land."
[39:44] &gt;&gt; They sailed back up to Province Town.
[39:50] Now, as we look at God's providence in
[39:53] all this, we find that the Lord had
[39:57] pulled them up to a place in New England
[40:00] that had been deserted.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[40:04] &gt;&gt; They could have landed multiple other
[40:06] places along the coast and immediately
[40:09] encountered Indian tribes right off the
[40:11] bat.
[40:15] But instead they land in this place on
[40:18] the coast where the Indian tribe that
[40:20] had been there had been decimated by
[40:22] sickness.
[40:25] &gt;&gt; It was cleared already for them where
[40:28] it' be a place where they could build
[40:30] homes and plant crops and do all these
[40:33] things.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; And there was no one there.
[40:39] There was fresh running water and there
[40:42] was no one that had already claimed it.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; They had been guided to
[40:49] &gt;&gt; all right
[40:49] &gt;&gt; the spot that would provide what they
[40:51] had need of. This didn't mean that they
[40:53] were going to have a time without
[40:54] struggle.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; But yet God had led them
[41:00] to just the right spot.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[41:03] with dependable fresh water and land
[41:06] already being cleared and all these
[41:08] things that made it at least a little
[41:11] bit easier
[41:12] &gt;&gt; for them to start
[41:16] in the new land
[41:21] &gt;&gt; now written in one of the journals they
[41:25] I'm trying to remember because I didn't
[41:26] write down I believe it's uh
[41:30] oh maybe I did write it
[41:37] No, I didn't. That's okay. But one of
[41:39] them wrote and talked about the
[41:42] hardships going,
[41:44] "Here we are landing in a land in this
[41:46] strange land. There are no houses for us
[41:50] to shelter in. There is no
[41:53] inn for us to refresh ourselves at.
[41:55] There is no and he goes listing the
[41:58] multiple things that if you just
[41:59] traveled to an already settled land that
[42:02] would be there to make it a little bit
[42:03] easier
[42:04] &gt;&gt; as you're coming in to travel.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; There were no hotels. There were no
[42:08] motel. There were no
[42:11] &gt;&gt; there was nothing.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; And they had to learn all over again how
[42:17] in the world to plant crops because they
[42:20] were deal dealing with soil that was
[42:23] more sandy than what they had come from
[42:24] in England.
[42:26] The things that had grown well over
[42:27] there were not necessarily what would
[42:29] grow well here. The things that had
[42:31] grown well there were not necessarily
[42:33] the things that you would grow the exact
[42:35] same way here.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Now when they arrived
[42:43] there had been a mixture. There were
[42:44] some that were the separatist pilgrims
[42:48] and there were some that had been sent
[42:50] by the merchants as other workers and
[42:53] things. And now as they were coming into
[42:55] this land,
[42:58] some of these others
[43:01] said, "Hey, there's no paperwork on
[43:03] this. There's no guiding principles that
[43:05] we have to follow. We can do whatever we
[43:08] want. We can live however we want. We
[43:12] can treat people however we want. We can
[43:14] do whatever we want because we are not
[43:17] under the king's law here."
[43:21] Now, the pilgrims had come with the goal
[43:25] to live in a Christian society.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; And so, before anyone ever got off the
[43:34] ship,
[43:35] there's no detail saying exactly how
[43:37] long they sat on there, and there's no
[43:39] detail saying exactly what the
[43:40] conversation was like.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But somehow they were able to take
[43:45] these two groups and come to an accord,
[43:49] come to an agreement
[43:51] of how they would govern
[43:56] &gt;&gt; to give some sort of guidelines that
[43:57] they would follow.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; It's now known as the Mayflower Compact.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; All right.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; And it's actually a very very short
[44:06] document.
[44:08] This is not, you know, it's like if
[44:10] somebody wants to go read the
[44:11] Constitution, this is really long. The
[44:14] Mayflower Compact,
[44:19] &gt;&gt; is 12 to 15 lines, maybe.
[44:23] &gt;&gt; This is not a long document,
[44:27] &gt;&gt; but yet it lays out that basically we
[44:30] all agree
[44:33] to work under an elected leader.
[44:37] We will vote together to set up what the
[44:42] government is and we will work together
[44:45] to live in this land.
[44:49] Now, I mentioned earlier that the
[44:52] sailors
[44:53] did not like the pilgrims.
[44:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[44:57] &gt;&gt; And after they had arrived,
[45:00] there were a lot of people that were
[45:02] sick and there were a lot of people that
[45:04] kept getting sick. And the sailor's
[45:06] mindset was get off the ship as fast as
[45:08] you can.
[45:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; They didn't want to help at all.
[45:14] They wanted the pilgrims out of their
[45:17] hair.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:19] &gt;&gt; But yet what you find is interesting.
[45:24] The sailors ended up getting sick.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; And then
[45:31] they begged the pilgrims that were
[45:34] healthy to come help take care of the
[45:36] sick sailors.
[45:41] &gt;&gt; And the pilgrims did.
[45:44] Yeah,
[45:44] &gt;&gt; because
[45:46] they were trying to live like
[45:49] Christians.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; They were trying to live according to
[45:52] the scriptures. They were trying to be
[45:55] witnesses.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; All right?
[45:58] Even if it was to the sailors that had
[46:01] ignored them, mistreated them, and
[46:03] despised them throughout the entire
[46:05] travel,
[46:08] &gt;&gt; they were going to
[46:10] still minister in the way that they
[46:12] could.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[46:18] Now, as we go from that, we then begin
[46:20] to get into the part of the story that
[46:24] most
[46:26] know about from history and school.
[46:30] We now get to the part where they begin
[46:33] to try to to build homes. They begin to
[46:36] try to plant crops. They begin to try to
[46:38] set up some sort of society.
[46:41] And yet person after person is getting
[46:43] sick. Person after person is dying.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; In fact, at one point there were either
[46:52] six or seven people in the entire camp
[46:55] that were healthy enough to work.
[46:59] what had been a group of a hundred
[47:02] now laid out and you have six to seven
[47:04] people that are trying to feed, get
[47:07] enough water, make sure the fires are
[47:09] going for everybody else,
[47:15] &gt;&gt; trying to nurse the sick, take care of
[47:18] crops,
[47:20] hunt for food if possible,
[47:23] all these different things,
[47:26] &gt;&gt; right? And they're going through trial
[47:29] after trial.
[47:32] They're suffering after suffering as
[47:34] they go through.
[47:39] And then they begin
[47:42] to meet some of the Native Americans.
[47:45] The one that we know most from our
[47:48] history books is the one that was called
[47:50] Squanto.
[47:51] But there were several others as well
[47:53] that came in at different points.
[47:56] And what's interesting is that
[48:00] both Squanto and
[48:04] one of the others that I forget the name
[48:07] of became Christians because of the
[48:10] witness that they saw in the pilgrims.
[48:14] Now, Squanto died only a year or two
[48:16] after meeting the pilgrims, but he had
[48:19] converted. He had become a Christian.
[48:22] The other Native American that had
[48:24] accepted Christ lived just outside the
[48:27] pilgrim settlement so that he could be
[48:29] part of the community.
[48:33] And they but when they came they began
[48:36] to help teach the pilgrims how to plant.
[48:41] How could you make things grow in this
[48:43] sandy soil? What were the best ways to
[48:46] catch the fish that were in the river?
[48:47] What was the best ways to to do some of
[48:50] these different things?
[48:53] And
[48:55] this is one of the few times as
[49:01] brother Wendell was talking about that
[49:02] when we identify with the flag of
[49:05] America, we identify with the good and
[49:07] with the bad. Well, this is one of the
[49:09] history times when this is one of the
[49:11] few times that our treaty with the
[49:14] Native Americans was good and honest and
[49:18] forthright and respected for
[49:23] either over 50 or 60 years without any
[49:25] problems.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; They had come in, they weren't because
[49:32] the pilgrims had this mindset, like I
[49:34] said, they weren't trying to get rich.
[49:36] They weren't out to make themselves
[49:39] wealthy. They weren't out to try to make
[49:42] everything great for themselves. They
[49:45] wanted to be able to live in safety and
[49:49] worship the way that they believed was
[49:52] right.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; They weren't looking to take everything
[49:57] from anyone else.
[49:58] They just wanted peace
[50:00] &gt;&gt; and they wanted to be able to raise
[50:03] their families and they wanted to be
[50:05] able to worship their God.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; It wasn't uncommon
[50:15] both in Europe and
[50:18] possibly even in the Native American
[50:20] community to have a celebration at the
[50:24] harvest time.
[50:26] This wasn't something that that stood
[50:28] out that had never been done before.
[50:30] This wasn't something that they had
[50:33] never experienced as they were farmers
[50:35] growing crops over in England.
[50:38] To celebrate the harvest coming in was
[50:41] very natural.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; All the work, all the hours, all the
[50:45] labor. And here you were receiving the
[50:47] fruits of your labors.
[50:49] &gt;&gt; And so you would celebrate that it had
[50:52] been a good harvest or you would
[50:53] celebrate that
[50:55] Maybe it wasn't a good harvest, but it
[50:57] was enough.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; But you would celebrate at those times.
[51:00] And so to have a celebration at the
[51:02] harvest
[51:05] &gt;&gt; was not abnormal.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; And so having this this harvest when
[51:12] they finally saw
[51:15] enough food coming in, when they finally
[51:17] saw that they maybe wouldn't have to
[51:20] struggle quite so hard the following
[51:22] year.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:25] They they gathered in their harvest and
[51:28] they began to celebrate and to give
[51:29] thanks to God for the bounty.
[51:34] And Masso Masso and some 90 men came and
[51:37] they celebrated together.
[51:40] The Native Americans brought five deer
[51:42] and all of the men exercised their arms.
[51:47] So they shot bows and arrows. They shot
[51:49] their guns. They competed in friendly
[51:51] games of wrestling or whatever type of
[51:54] maybe running or whatever type of sports
[51:56] they they would do at that time.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; It was a three-day feast that also
[52:03] included fish and fowl as well of some
[52:06] of the harvest.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; That celebration that of the pilgrims
[52:11] and the Native Americans is the
[52:12] tradition that was handed down to us and
[52:14] became
[52:16] [crying]
[52:17] &gt;&gt; Thanksgiving.
[52:21] You know, I've been talking to my Sunday
[52:24] school students the past few weeks about
[52:27] being thankful and about thankfulness
[52:30] and about thanksgiving.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; And when you go through the scriptures
[52:34] and you look at the word thanksgiving,
[52:38] &gt;&gt; there are two things that really stand
[52:40] out.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; The first is that thanksgiving is always
[52:45] paired with praise and worship.
[52:49] It is a part
[52:52] of our communication and our
[52:54] relationship with God
[52:56] &gt;&gt; to give thanks. You don't just come in
[52:58] and praise God because he's so powerful
[53:01] and praise God because he's so amazing
[53:03] and praise God. Yes, you do that.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; But you also go in and you thank God for
[53:09] his many blessings. You thank God for
[53:11] all that he's done for us. You thank God
[53:13] for how he's taken care of
[53:16] &gt;&gt; thing after thing after thing.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And we thank God that
[53:21] &gt;&gt; he chose us. He called us. He shed his
[53:24] blood for us.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; But it's a part of that conversation
[53:28] with God. It's a part of our normal, it
[53:31] should be a part of our normal daytoday
[53:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[53:34] &gt;&gt; prayer life.
[53:37] The other thing that you find is as you
[53:40] go through the scriptures, it will talk
[53:41] about the sacrifice of thanksgiving.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; And when it's talking about the
[53:48] sacrifice of thanksgiving,
[53:51] it's not for the most part talking about
[53:54] a literal literal sacrifice on an altar.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Okay? There is a sacrifice of
[54:00] thanksgiving but most of the times when
[54:03] you go through the scriptures it is not
[54:05] referencing build an altar and then
[54:08] you're going to sacrifice this
[54:09] particular animal on it and this is the
[54:12] sacrifice of thanksgiving.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; And so it's something that
[54:19] you know you have to actually think
[54:20] about just a little bit. Okay. What what
[54:23] about thanksgiving
[54:25] is a sacrifice?
[54:30] What about
[54:34] being thankful
[54:37] &gt;&gt; is a sacrifice?
[54:43] I'm not going to ask my class because
[54:44] they were in there talking with me.
[54:46] Well, or at least listening to me talk
[54:47] about it.
[54:49] Yeah.
[54:56] I'm going to pick on the adults for a
[54:58] minute. Sister Mary, what would be a
[55:00] sacrifice about being thankful?
[55:03] What would be a sacrifice about offering
[55:05] thanksgiving
[55:11] when you don't feel like it? Okay,
[55:15] Dylan, what do you think? What would be
[55:20] why would it be a sacrifice to offer
[55:23] thanksgiving?
[55:29] Okay.
[55:31] So I don't know that there is one set
[55:33] right answer. But as I thought about it,
[55:36] particularly as I looked at it within
[55:39] our society.
[55:42] We live in a society where most people
[55:45] think they are owed everything.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; People think they deserve everything.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; To me, like I said, this is not gospel.
[55:58] This is brother Harry's opinion after
[56:00] thinking and praying about it a little
[56:02] bit.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; So if you disagree, I'm okay with that.
[56:06] Brother Wendle can correct me if he
[56:08] disagrees. I am I'm fine taking
[56:10] correction.
[56:13] But to me,
[56:17] if I am truly expressing my
[56:19] thankfulness,
[56:20] I am having to sacrifice my pride. I'm
[56:24] having to sacrifice my own
[56:28] inflated ego, my own thinking that I'm
[56:32] so great. I deserve all of this.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; And I have to then approach in the
[56:37] humility to go
[56:39] &gt;&gt; I appreciate that because
[56:42] &gt;&gt; sure
[56:43] &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve that.
[56:46] And this applies even more when you're
[56:48] looking at it as the sacrifice of
[56:50] thanksgiving to the Lord because I
[56:53] deserved nothing.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; There was nothing that he has done for
[56:57] me that I can stand here and gay say I
[57:00] deserved that.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; You owed me that, God.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; It's a good way to get struck by
[57:07] lightning.
[57:11] We are supposed to be coming in and
[57:14] we're offering our thanksgiving as part
[57:16] of our worship, as part of our praise.
[57:19] And we're offering it in the humility to
[57:21] know, God, I did not deserve anything
[57:23] you've given me. I did not deserve you
[57:26] to choose me. I did not deserve you to
[57:28] die for me. I did not deserve for you to
[57:31] provide.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; I did not deserve for you to give me a
[57:34] job. I did not deserve for you to heal
[57:36] my body. I did not deserve for you to
[57:38] give me a family.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Take your pick of what it is. Everything
[57:43] that's there, I did not deserve it.
[57:47] &gt;&gt; It is not because of my greatness and my
[57:51] overinflated ego that I get anything.
[57:56] I have to sacrifice that thought that I
[58:00] am so great, so wonderful,
[58:03] &gt;&gt; and approach with the humility of thank
[58:06] you Lord.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you for what you've done for me.
[58:11] Thank you for how you provide for me.
[58:13] Thank you for all the blessings that are
[58:15] in my life. And so many of them maybe I
[58:17] don't even notice.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:20] You know, most people when they think
[58:22] about Thanksgiving in the modern era,
[58:25] it's all about
[58:28] the great food, the the big feast
[58:31] they're going to eat. It's all about
[58:34] football on TV.
[58:37] It's all about the parade on TV.
[58:42] It's all about time with friends and
[58:45] family that maybe you really don't want
[58:46] to be with, but you're going to be with
[58:48] because it's a holiday and that's what
[58:49] you do.
[58:54] In fact, it's even become normal
[58:58] that a well-known part of Thanksgiving,
[59:00] if you look it up online, and if it's on
[59:02] the internet, it must be true. But if
[59:04] you look it up, there is what's called a
[59:06] cousin walk.
[59:10] I hadn't heard about this until someone
[59:12] at work mentioned it and I had to look
[59:14] this up. And this is very much because
[59:16] of the crowd that I run with. This is
[59:18] not how life works. But the cousin walk
[59:22] is when you are around family that
[59:24] stress you out so much that you need to
[59:28] walk away and go outside and have a
[59:31] joint in order to relax to be able to
[59:34] get back with the family.
[59:37] And as shocking as that is to hear in a
[59:39] sermon, that is a normal standard part
[59:41] of Thanksgiving for a lot of people
[59:43] apparently.
[59:47] Like I said, obviously that's not the
[59:48] circle I run in because I had never
[59:50] heard of it until someone at work
[59:51] mentioned it. And I had to go look this
[59:53] up to go, is this a real thing?
[59:57] Cuz this does not sound like what
[59:59] Thanksgiving is supposed to be.
[1:00:04] But in for most people, they're not
[1:00:07] thinking about let me thank God for
[1:00:10] everything that he's done.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Let me thank God for his blessings. Let
[1:00:13] me thank God for his provision. Let me
[1:00:16] thank God for what we have.
[1:00:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Now, as what I mentioned before, some of
[1:00:22] the challenges that the pilgrims faced
[1:00:24] are now becoming the same challenges we
[1:00:25] face here.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; The challenges that they faced in
[1:00:33] the other country. My mind's blanking
[1:00:34] for a moment.
[1:00:36] Holland. There we go. The challenges
[1:00:38] that they faced in Holland because of
[1:00:41] the tolerance that allowed everything to
[1:00:44] go.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; We see the same thing here.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; We have now become a nation of
[1:00:50] tolerance.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Great. You can act however you want. You
[1:00:55] can do whatever you want. Whatever you
[1:00:57] think is truth, if it's your truth,
[1:01:00] that's good enough.
[1:01:04] It used to be you would say as long as
[1:01:06] you're not bothering anybody else, you
[1:01:08] believe whatever you want to believe.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; Now it's become as long as you're only
[1:01:12] bothering Christians, you're good.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; As long as you don't bother the Muslims,
[1:01:20] as long as you don't bother the Islam,
[1:01:22] as long as you don't bother the
[1:01:24] atheists, as long as you don't bother
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; dot dot dot dot
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, Christian. Yeah, you can bother
[1:01:30] Christians all you want.
[1:01:31] just don't bother the others and you're
[1:01:33] fine.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; We've become a nation of tolerance and
[1:01:38] the same challenges that the pilgrims
[1:01:41] saw in that nation.
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; The temptation of sin that would attract
[1:01:48] their young people. The loss of identity
[1:01:54] for who they truly were.
[1:01:58] Their loss of cultural and spiritual
[1:02:02] integrity
[1:02:04] is the same thing that we now see today
[1:02:07] in America. The same struggles that we
[1:02:09] face.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; As a parent, you're trying to raise your
[1:02:14] child to resist those spiritual
[1:02:16] temptations.
[1:02:18] We're trying to raise our children
[1:02:21] to hold on to their identity as
[1:02:24] Christians.
[1:02:27] And yes, as brother Wendell talked
[1:02:29] about, we're proud to be Americans.
[1:02:31] We're patriotic. We stand up for the
[1:02:35] flag. We respect the flag,
[1:02:40] but we're still trying to hold on to our
[1:02:43] identity because this is not our land.
[1:02:47] Okay.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; You know, as we talk about Thanksgiving
[1:02:50] and this is the season everybody thinks
[1:02:53] about it.
[1:02:55] As I mentioned earlier, for us as
[1:02:57] Christians,
[1:02:59] thanksgiving and thankfulness should be
[1:03:02] part of our everyday
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; walk, our everyday talk, our everyday
[1:03:07] communication.
[1:03:09] Because thanksgiving,
[1:03:11] as I mentioned, it it's a part of
[1:03:13] worship. When you read through the
[1:03:15] Psalms, you will see thanksgiving paired
[1:03:19] with praise, paired with worship, time
[1:03:21] after time after time after time.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 18
[1:03:30] says, "In everything give thanks, for
[1:03:32] this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[1:03:34] concerning you." [crying]
[1:03:38] In everything give thanks. That doesn't
[1:03:39] just mean in the good times.
[1:03:42] It doesn't it doesn't just mean when
[1:03:44] your back doesn't hurt. It doesn't just
[1:03:47] mean when you've got every bill paid and
[1:03:50] you have more than enough money in the
[1:03:52] bank.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; It doesn't just mean when you've got
[1:03:54] more than enough work, when you've got
[1:03:56] more than enough this or that.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; It doesn't just mean when everybody's
[1:04:01] healthy and happy and doing well.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; But it's give thanks in in everything.
[1:04:07] Yes.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; As Christians, we're not just offering
[1:04:13] thanks at Thanksgiving. It's a good
[1:04:16] reminder,
[1:04:18] but we shouldn't have to be reminded.
[1:04:20] This should be part of our everyday
[1:04:23] life. This should be part of our
[1:04:24] everyday relationship with Christ.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Psalms 107 and verse one.
[1:04:34] Oh, give thanks unto the Lord, for he is
[1:04:36] good. For his mercy endureth forever.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; We can go through psalm after psalm,
[1:04:46] scripture after scripture
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; that is reminding us and telling us,
[1:04:50] give thanks to the Lord.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; Worship him. Praise him.
[1:04:56] Give thanks for his many blessings. Give
[1:04:58] thanks for the way that he's working in
[1:05:00] your life. Give thanks for how he's
[1:05:02] helped you overcome. Give thanks in the
[1:05:05] midst of the trial.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; Give thanks in the midst of the storm.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; The pilgrims as they came into this time
[1:05:18] of thanksgiving,
[1:05:21] there had been a lot of death. They had
[1:05:23] had a lot of loss.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; They had gone through a lot of
[1:05:26] struggles.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; But yet, they could still come through
[1:05:31] it. And they could still express their
[1:05:35] thankfulness
[1:05:36] to the God that had brought them to the
[1:05:38] new land. Express their thankfulness to
[1:05:41] the God that had given them the crops,
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; that had given them the Native American
[1:05:47] friends that would help them to be able
[1:05:49] to grow the crop crops better.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; The God that had helped them to survive
[1:05:55] diseases when so many had not.
[1:05:59] This wasn't
[1:06:01] an easy time.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Even though it was the harvest, this
[1:06:06] wasn't a time that you would be looking
[1:06:07] at and thinking, "Oh, let's celebrate.
[1:06:10] Look at all the graves. Look at all that
[1:06:14] we've lost. Look at all that we've
[1:06:16] suffered."
[1:06:18] But yet, they could still go into with
[1:06:21] the thankfulness
[1:06:23] that God had provided.
[1:06:26] As I mentioned when Paul was talking, he
[1:06:28] said that God sets the borders,
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; that God sets the kingdoms, that God
[1:06:35] sets the nations.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; And now we can look back and go,
[1:06:40] so God sent
[1:06:43] the pilgrims here
[1:06:45] to begin the start of a nation that
[1:06:49] would become the home
[1:06:52] to a Kentucky hillbilly.
[1:06:55] that would be the messenger to the last
[1:06:57] age.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; That would break the seals and open up
[1:07:01] the word
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; that will allow us to just like the
[1:07:05] pilgrims had desired be able to worship
[1:07:08] according to the word.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; The pilgrims came because they wanted to
[1:07:12] worship the way the Bible said.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; They didn't want to just follow what
[1:07:16] some orthodox religion told them to do.
[1:07:19] They didn't want to follow what some
[1:07:20] king or some man had set up. They wanted
[1:07:22] to be able to look at the scripture and
[1:07:24] according to their convictions and the
[1:07:26] convictions of their heart go this is
[1:07:28] what I'm supposed to do.
[1:07:31] And God said in that land where that's
[1:07:33] the desire I'm going to place the
[1:07:35] prophet that will open the word so that
[1:07:38] people can worship according to the word
[1:07:41] and actually understand what's there
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; and they can worship and they can have
[1:07:47] that freedom.
[1:07:50] And yes, there are plenty of things
[1:07:53] about America that we wish we could
[1:07:55] change. There are plenty of things about
[1:07:57] America that we can look at and go, "I'm
[1:08:01] not proud of that." Whether it's present
[1:08:03] or history,
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; yes, the flag is marred.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; Yes, there have been things that
[1:08:09] happened that we can look back and go,
[1:08:11] "That wasn't right.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; That wasn't what was supposed to happen.
[1:08:15] That wasn't how the nation should have
[1:08:18] gone.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; But yet we can also stand here and go, I
[1:08:24] have the freedom to worship. I have the
[1:08:27] freedom to praise my God. I have the
[1:08:29] freedom
[1:08:31] to live according to the convictions
[1:08:34] that he's given me.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:39] We come into this season of Thanksgiving
[1:08:41] and we could go through all the
[1:08:43] presidents that made proclamations about
[1:08:45] it. We could go through the history of
[1:08:47] how it became actually a holiday and all
[1:08:50] these different things.
[1:08:54] But Thanksgiving
[1:08:56] for a Christian
[1:09:00] is part of us.
[1:09:02] &gt;&gt; For a Christian, thanksgiving should be
[1:09:05] at our heart.
[1:09:07] We don't have to have a specific day for
[1:09:10] it.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; We appreciate the day. We enjoy the
[1:09:13] food. We enjoy spending time with our
[1:09:15] family. We enjoy the fellowship.
[1:09:18] But whether it's
[1:09:20] at the end of November,
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; whether it's the middle of January or
[1:09:26] February, whether it's the heat of the
[1:09:27] summer, whether it's the cold of the
[1:09:29] winter, whether it's take your pick of
[1:09:32] what season, time, whenever.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:38] Every day
[1:09:40] is thanksgiving for us.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; Every day is the day that we are coming
[1:09:45] to God, that we are praising him, that
[1:09:47] we are thanking him, that we are
[1:09:49] expressing our gratitude for all that
[1:09:51] he's done for us
[1:09:55] because it's a part of us. It's part of
[1:09:58] who we are as Christians. It's part of
[1:10:01] how we worship.
[1:10:05] That's what Thanksgiving is for us,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; brother.
[1:10:11] [applause]
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:10:34] church

[1:10:40] your ministry. That's a hard thing.
[1:10:44] Amen. Like you said, you didn't want to
[1:10:46] do this. Amen.
[1:10:49] Amen. I I never volunteered either. So,
[1:10:53] my pastor said, "You're getting up
[1:10:55] there."
[1:10:57] 17, 18 years old,
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; you know. So I obeyed. Thank God. Amen.
[1:11:04] That's all he asks us to do is obey.
[1:11:07] Amen. And be thankful. Amen. Give thanks
[1:11:11] with a grateful heart.

[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; WOO.
[1:21:57] Do
[1:21:57] &gt;&gt; I got a second here to
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, you do.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; to take the time while I got a
[1:22:01] microphone.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; All right. Well, I just want to say I'm
[1:22:04] so happy to be here tonight. We uh had
[1:22:06] brother Theo down with us for the
[1:22:08] meetings this weekend and really had a
[1:22:09] good time. on. So we said, "Well, we're
[1:22:11] going to take him back up there. We may
[1:22:12] as well be in church." So, uh, we just
[1:22:14] are really glad to be here. Very
[1:22:16] thankful. I'm really thankful for
[1:22:18] Brother Wendell. And he's had a very big
[1:22:20] part to play in our family, the church
[1:22:22] here, the camps, and all the things you
[1:22:24] guys put on. And, uh, I've told this
[1:22:26] before, I'll tell it again. Years ago,
[1:22:28] he said we [music] should teach our
[1:22:30] children to praise.
[1:22:32] And that was the fruit of that seed that
[1:22:34] was planted. And I just thank the Lord
[1:22:36] for three children [applause and music]
[1:22:39] that love the Lord. They love to praise
[1:22:41] the Lord. And my wife's already feeling
[1:22:45] the fourth doing little somersaults in
[1:22:48] there when the music starts and [music]
[1:22:49] things like that. She's like, "It's
[1:22:51] going to moving again. It's going to
[1:22:52] moving again." So, we just we've got a
[1:22:54] lot to be thankful for, saints.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; We have the word of this hour that has
[1:22:58] made all these mysteries clear.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; And we know who we serve. We know how to
[1:23:04] serve, how to please God. And and oh my,
[1:23:06] what a blessing it is. God bless you. We
[1:23:08] love you everyone. Appreciate you.
[1:23:11] [applause]
[1:23:13] [music]
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:37] All [singing and music] my words fall
[1:23:39] short.
[1:23:42] I've got nothing [music] new.
[1:23:47] How could I express
[1:23:51] [music]
[1:23:52] all my gratitude?
[1:23:57] I could sing these [singing] songs
[1:24:01] [music]
[1:24:02] as I often do,
[1:24:06] but every [singing] song must stand
[1:24:11] and you never do.
[1:24:16] So I throw up my hands and praise you
[1:24:20] again and [singing] again.
[1:24:24] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.
[1:24:32] Hallelujah.
[1:24:36] And I know [singing] it's not much. I'm
[1:24:39] nothing else [music] fit for a king
[1:24:43] except for a heart singing [singing]
[1:24:46] hallelu.
[1:24:51] Hallelujah.
[1:24:59] I've got one response.
[1:25:04] I've got [singing] just [music] one move
[1:25:09] with [singing] my arm. [music]
[1:25:14] I will worship you.
[1:25:19] So I throw up my [singing] hands and
[1:25:22] praise you again and again.
[1:25:26] Cuz [music and singing] all that I have
[1:25:28] is a hallelujah.
[1:25:34] Hallelujah.
[1:25:38] And I know it's [singing] not much, but
[1:25:40] I'm nothing else fit for a king
[1:25:45] [music] except for a horse singing
[1:25:47] [singing]
[1:25:48] hallelujah.
[1:25:53] Hallelujah.
[1:25:59] [music]
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; So come on my soul. Oh, don't you
[1:26:19] [singing] get shy on me. Lift up [music]

[1:27:19] Cuz all that I have is a hallelujah.
[1:27:27] Hallelujah.
[1:27:29] [music]
[1:27:30] And I know it's not much. Nothing else
[1:27:35] for a king [music]
[1:27:38] except for a heart singing hallelujah.
[1:27:45] Hallelujah.

[2:24:31] willingness

[2:24:39] because I can remember my first spark of
[2:24:43] interest occurred when I was 10 years
[2:24:45] old and just continued to grow and
[2:24:50] all my children come up following my
[2:24:53] wife and I our examples.
[2:24:55] best we try to live them and
[2:25:00] they [music]

[2:25:06] young people. It's so amazing and
[2:25:10] [snorts] refreshing. Know the crop is
[2:25:13] not fading off, [music] but it's a new
[2:25:16] crop coming up

[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; I just want to truly be [music] thankful
[2:26:34] for prayer answered.
[2:26:37] Uh probably 25 [music] years ago, maybe
[2:26:40] 30 to see my son give his heart to the
[2:26:44] Lord. And his father was the first
[2:26:47] [music] of the prayer.
[2:26:50] But um and my grand my [music] first
[2:26:52] grandson Weston that is a just a miracle
[2:26:57] within itself also I'm thankful to the
[2:27:00] Lord speaking of miracles of keeping my

[2:27:33] drag the service out. Oh. Oh. Oh.
[2:27:41] All right.
[2:27:45] I just want to say that I really love
[2:27:47] this church for uh growing up in it and
[2:27:50] just [music] how far I've made it and
[2:27:51] how much it's done for me like mentally.

[2:28:33] without him and without God I I I pretty
[2:28:38] much had given up you know so uh
[2:28:42] everybody that's been a participant in
[2:28:44] that, you know, just accepting me back
[2:28:47] because I mean I was

[2:28:52] be on my way to prison because that's
[2:28:54] where I was heading, you know. But my
[2:28:57] brother opened [music] out his home and,
[2:29:00] you know, gave me that opportunity and
[2:29:02] brother Wendle did the same just [music]
[2:29:04] to they had faith in me and believed in
[2:29:06] me.
[2:29:08] &gt;&gt; And so I'm [music] very thankful for
[2:29:10] that in this church
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; and most thankful for God's grace for,
[2:29:15] you know, without him we'd be nothing.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:29:18] &gt;&gt; So, and [music] that's it. Amen. All
[2:29:21] [applause] right.
[2:29:29] Anyone else? Amen. Brother David

[2:30:06] the Lord's got his hand on me.
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; He's kept me up for years. I give him
[2:30:12] thanks quite a bit, and I still don't
[2:30:14] think I thank him enough.
[2:30:17] But I thank him every day for what he
[2:30:18] does for me. Like I said, my medical is
[2:30:22] of good report.
[2:30:25] I've got a lot of people that love me
[2:30:28] and I'm very appreciative to them.

[2:30:45] You only know.
[2:30:49] I'm glad you [music] see
[2:30:53] through eyes of love.
[2:30:57] A hopeless case, [music]
[2:31:01] an empty [singing] place
[2:31:06] if not for grace.
[2:31:08] Amazing [music] grace. Amazing grace.
[2:31:13] Oh, can we stand and praise him?
[2:31:16] OH, I ONCE was lost,
[2:31:21] but now I'm found.
[2:31:25] A hopeless case,
[2:31:29] an empty [singing]
[2:31:31] place. [music]
[2:31:33] If not for grace,
[2:31:37] where would I be?
[2:31:41] You only know. [singing]
[2:31:44] I'm glad you see
[2:31:48] through eyes of love.
[2:31:52] A hopeless case [music]
[2:31:56] an empty place.
[2:32:00] Oh, amazing grace.
[2:32:04] Amazing [music and singing] grace. As we
[2:32:06] turn into our master, how sweet the
[2:32:09] sound.
[2:32:12] I once was lost,
[2:32:15] but now I'm found.
[2:32:19] [singing] A hopeless case,
[2:32:23] an [music] empty place. [singing]
[2:32:26] Peace if not for grace. Amazing grace. I
[2:32:30] got to sing it again. Amazing [singing]
[2:32:32] grace,
[2:32:35] how sweet the sound.
[2:32:38] Oh,
[2:32:41] what [music]
[2:32:48] [music]
[2:32:51] an empty place
[2:32:54] if God. Oh, let's sing it [music] again.
[2:32:58] Amazing grace,
[2:33:01] [music] how sweet the sound
[2:33:06] was [singing] lost,
[2:33:09] [music] but now I'm found.
[2:33:13] A hopeless case, [music]
[2:33:17] an empty place
[2:33:21] if not for grace,
[2:33:24] a hopeless case,
[2:33:29] an empty [music and singing] place
[2:33:34] if not for grace.
[2:33:37] Bless the Lord.
[2:33:40] How blessed we [music] are in this
[2:33:42] Thanksgiving
[2:33:44] season.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[2:33:57] I see I see what this message [music]
[2:34:00] has produced
[2:34:03] and I think the proof is in the pudding.
[2:34:08] And
[2:34:12] it's God's divine grace that has
[2:34:18] been extended to us [music] in this
[2:34:20] generation by the word.
[2:34:23] And I I can truly say that
[2:34:28] um what an incredible
[2:34:32] cream of the crop that I get to preach
[2:34:35] to
[2:34:37] on a weekly basis.
[2:34:40] The cream of the crop,
[2:34:44] young people,
[2:34:47] mamas and daddies, the desires,
[2:34:50] everyone desiring [music] to love God.
[2:34:53] I thank God for that.
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; I thank God
[2:34:59] for the glorious message of Jesus Christ
[2:35:03] that's come to give us a settledness.
[2:35:08] And again, that's not to say [music]
[2:35:10] that there's not a struggle or there's
[2:35:12] not a battle.
[2:35:14] It's just simply [music] to say
[2:35:17] that there's an anchor.
[2:35:21] And many [music] times
[2:35:24] many people feel
[2:35:26] and especially [music] young but but
[2:35:29] it's all of us we
[2:35:33] you know
[2:35:35] uh
[2:35:38] Satan fights us in our minds that we're
[2:35:41] not children of God, [music] that we're
[2:35:44] not bride, we're not saved.
[2:35:48] But just to look around and [music] your
[2:35:50] desires and your love, your enjoyment
[2:35:53] with the word of the Lord, [music] being
[2:35:56] able to come and sing as we have sung
[2:35:58] tonight.
[2:36:00] What gives you that?
[2:36:02] What what gives you those desires?
[2:36:07] What causes
[2:36:09] that that overwhelming
[2:36:11] love?
[2:36:14] It's God.
[2:36:17] Don't ever second guessess
[2:36:20] God's love for you [music] and God's
[2:36:22] grace upon your life.
[2:36:26] This [music] message has come to you.
[2:36:30] You've not accepted it.
[2:36:33] It's accepted you.
[2:36:36] It's brought you in [music]
[2:36:38] and said, "You're mine."
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; When [music] I say you didn't accept it,
[2:36:44] it accepted you. What part do you have
[2:36:47] [music] as the song says, "Something
[2:36:49] keeps holding me."
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; When you've said you're [music] going to
[2:36:53] quit, you've couldn't
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; because the message
[2:36:59] has pulled you.
[2:37:02] And if there's someone here tonight in
[2:37:04] this Thanksgiving [music] season that
[2:37:05] you're struggling
[2:37:08] in your soul and
[2:37:11] but God sees every tear.
[2:37:14] God sees [music] the tears at night when
[2:37:16] no one else does.
[2:37:18] God knows the heart.
[2:37:21] And I want you to know
[2:37:24] that he's bottling up every tear.
[2:37:27] There's been a lot of wonderful songs of
[2:37:30] grace [music] and courage.
[2:37:32] Wonderful songs of Amen. when we don't
[2:37:36] understand where we're at and why we're
[2:37:38] there. And that's these are these were
[2:37:41] songs tonight that [music] comes from a
[2:37:44] real understanding
[2:37:46] that God is in control of all things.
[2:37:50] Amen.
[2:37:51] So, let's take this to heart in this
[2:37:54] Thanksgiving [music] season
[2:37:56] and and love him and and [music] um if
[2:38:02] you're not walking closely with the Lord
[2:38:03] tonight, why don't you do it?
[2:38:07] If you're a little weward in your
[2:38:09] spirit, your soul, why don't you just
[2:38:13] talk to the Lord?
[2:38:16] Sometimes the hardest thing for me to
[2:38:18] [music] do was to talk to dad.
[2:38:20] Amen. Dad was the disciplinarian.
[2:38:26] But once I become a father
[2:38:29] and knew the heart of my father, I knew
[2:38:31] that my dad was for me the entire time.
[2:38:34] He didn't want to put me in a corner. He
[2:38:35] didn't want to give me a whooping.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even though he's given me a few of
[2:38:39] them, but his heart,
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; his heart [music] was for me.
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; And God's grace for you. [music] You
[2:38:49] might think, "Well, God don't love me.
[2:38:51] Well, God don't." That's a bunch of
[2:38:53] baloney.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:38:55] &gt;&gt; You cannot
[2:38:58] You cannot exhaust the love of God.
[2:39:02] A son of God cannot exhaust his love. He
[2:39:07] loves his children. Can you say amen?
[2:39:12] Praise the Lord.
[2:39:15] Well,
[2:39:17] I enjoyed this tonight.
[2:39:20] [applause]
