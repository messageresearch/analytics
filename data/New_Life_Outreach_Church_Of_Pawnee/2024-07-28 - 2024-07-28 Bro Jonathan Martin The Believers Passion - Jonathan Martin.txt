the world far behind press toward the mark found in Christ not entangle the cares of this life stand for truth and what is right I'm called to overcome and this is my time say there's never been a day

groom is in her on Truth she standing fir and this is our time to fight to take a stand for what is Right leave all the world far far behind press to the mark found in Christ be not entangled with the cares of this life stand for truth and what is right we're called to overcome this is our time oh we're called to over overcome this is our our [Music] time glory to God [Music] amen aren't you glad to realize that it is our time we're living in a glorious hour I tell you it's becoming more and more clear to us just what a great hour that we're living in and I think of what the prophet said in the sermon why Christ speak that when Moses seen scripture being fulfilled it anointed his faith and I I tell you friends we are living in a an hour where scripture is made plain and clear before us and the Word of Promise is so made manifest before us it it's it's anointing our faith and um I tell you I I don't know about you but my faith is just climbing Higher and Higher and greater and greater greater and I tell you we're living in in a time of great possibilities where God is among us to fulfill his word and uh we just deem it a great uh privilege to be here with you and definitely wish it was under uh different circumstances and uh we've been just greatly uh saddened by the passing of Alba Jo and uh we just we glad we were able to come and uh just to share our love for sister Thalman brother Michael and uh you know just to convey our hearts we're just uh so uh just uh think of uh think of them uh very dearly and uh just got wonderful wonderful times of not just memory but a great love in our hearts for this family and um I know that God's got a great Embrace he's a great comforter and and uh he he makes everything perfect in in his time and his season and and uh God's you know God don't make mistakes and no and uh I believe that you know we've got to believe that uh We've we've got to uh have confidence in God's great love and and that God doesn't make mistakes Satan never gets a good one over on God and uh so we just hold to uh the word with all that is within us and you know I thought brother Michael just did a tremendous job and uh just over the the different things that I was uh able to see on Friday and and Saturday and uh brother Wendell did a just an outstanding job on the sermon and it was just tremendous and uh I know that your love that you have expressed to uh not only sister thelman and brother Michael but also just the family and the the this community it's both uh seen and felt and uh it's a great witness it's a it's a tremendous witness I think that you can never you can never uh I I can't remember how exactly Paul says but uh never get tired and well doing and uh I know that God God sees it but also the the community sees it as well and uh they're watching you know they're they're always watching and uh it's a great privilege to be able just to be the light uh be a light be his light and so uh if you have your Bibles I uh will turn over to just a a few different places but we'll turn over to Hebrews the uh third chapter and I uh just praying and trying to get direction for this morning and I just kept coming back to uh just a a little something that we have been uh been preaching on there at the home church and uh we just pray that it'll be uh uh an encouragement and a blessing to you yes for this morning and um I would like to uh take for a text the believer's passion and uh we'll just uh read Hebrews 3 And1 and also Zephaniah 3 and9 and then 1 Corinthians 13 And1 and um it is sure good to have my family and I appreciate my wife singing and just a wonderful song and so good to be here with my brothers and uh just love brother Shawn brother Wendell uh verily dearly and hold them in high respects and and uh high regards as great men of God and uh but Hebrews the 3D chapter the first verse wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus now that word profession is the same as confession and so we've got to consider the Apostle and high priest of our confession who is Christ Jesus now Zephaniah the 3 chapter the 9th verse for then will I turn to the people a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to to serve him with one consent and so notice what we're going to do when our hearts are turned back to a pure language we're going to call upon the name of the Lord and we know who his name is it's the Lord Jesus Christ and we're going to serve him with one consent Now 1 Corinthians 13 and verse 11 when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things now may God just add the blessings to the reading of the word you can have your seats the believer's passion and I believe that the passion of the believer is the word of God and uh we know that Jesus said that heavens and earth will pass away but uh my word shall not pass away we uh read there in Isaiah that uh where it's promised that the word will not return void but it shall accomplish that which it was sent to do we know that the word of God is not the words of a man it is not just mere uh formalities it's not just uh randomly speaking it's not just a random promise that with good intents we we try to fulfill it and a lot of times we uh we find ourselves falling short of that but we know that the word of God is has the creative power of God to enforce that word to bring it to pass and God is not just randomly speaking something but he speaks it with purpose he speaks it with intent and so when he speaks that word then he's got something in his vision it's he's got something in his in his mind and we know that what a what a word is is a thought expressed and God has never had any new thought about anything uh but he speaks his eternal thoughts and it's with intent that that word would be made manifest so I believe we should have a passion for Christ and his promises espe uh the Vindicated word for this day as we realize that God predestinated a word for every age and then he predestinated Believers uh to believe that word for that age and we understand that Noah's uh if we were preaching simply trying to preach Noah's message it wouldn't have an effect upon us we tried to ple uh preach Moses message even uh Jesus message in his day it would have effect upon us but we have got to be passionate about the word for this day for it to have effect in our lives and and that's our desire isn't it we we want to see the word have effect we we don't want to just simply be Christians and name only we don't want to be church members we don't want to just simply come and listen to uh a wonderful sermon uh regardless of how great the preacher is this is more than just a lecture this is more than just a uh uh a sermon coming across like a passionate speech uh and there are people Gathering uh you know thousands of people uh gather around to hear a a a passionate uh Speech and my it gets them you know it gets them energized it gets them excited to go and do things maybe start a business or help them out in their business or help them out in their marriages help them out raising their children there there's a seems like there's a passionate speech for anything but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the word of God that has the power of the spirit behind it in it to bring it to manifestation in our lives and so this is more than just uh you know uh saying well being passionate about the word and then just going out going through our days and wondering you know wondering how we're going to overcome and wondering how we're going to get healed and wondering what the solution is to our marriage problems and wondering about this and that and no the word is the answer the word is the answer because it has the creative power to enforce that word in the heart of the believer and so there's going going to be many people that actually are just uh holding to the word with a very casual faith and and uh you know they have faith in God they love God they believe God as far as they can go but they're very casual with it but I don't think that we should be casual with the word of God I I think that we you know we should treat the word of God as the absolute as the final say the final authority over every situation in our lives say and you know that word casual actually means relaxed and unconcerned indifferent apathetic uncaring uninterested and we find that you know the prophet of God would actually preach some sermons titled convinced then concerned and so you know casual is meaning unconcerned well then we should be passionate by uh about the Revelation that we have received in this hour meaning we should be convinced of what God has done in this hour and what it does for us it makes us concerned when we see what is happening in our government when we see what is happening in our in our communities when we see it's just become a public Stripes all around us and it's another Sodom and gomorra and all of these things then it should make us concerned amen it it should make us concerned about one another it should make us concerned about our church it should make us concerned about our families it should make us concerned amen that what we are doing with this gospel is pleasing go to God that we're handling the word right that we're we're doing what is the will of God in this age Amen in our lives because you see uh the prophet of God would tell us amen that it is Jesus Christ that is among us today isin't that right amen we're not in the presence of your pastor we're not in the presence of just good church people but we're actually in the presence of Jesus Christ himself what is Jesus Christ well he's the same yesterday today and forever and then uh the prophet would tell us in the token he would tell us that that Luther knew this day would come and Wesley knew this day would come and and and and he would say finny and Calvin and name all of those uh reformers knew the pillar of fire would return to the church to lead the church and brother bradam would say that this is the token age we've just went through a couple of marriages and you know I I my daughter got married and uh brother Sea's daughter an got married married and and they enter into a covenant and then as you as they enter into this Covenant then you ask what do you have what what token can you show me that this Covenant is coming into effect and and then they turn around and say well I've got a ring and that ring is a symbol of Eternity and you slip that ring upon their fingers and it is a token of the vows the Covenant that they that they just made with one another and brother Brandon would say that the token could not be preached in any other age but in the evening time what is the evening light the word made manifest the promise made reality and when the Covenant is come back into full view then there is a token required to as a as a something that you can have that God can have that you're entering into this invisible Union and the Covenant is becoming a reality in your life and in your homes and in your church and and and you have that token well the prophet of God would say the token is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we are convinced that we are living in the token age where the Covenant has returned back into full strength amen we we could say like this we've had the mechanics we've had the word we we we we we've had good sermons but we are living in the age that the Dynamics have come to the mechanics that we have believed and now it is becoming a reality it's come into manifestation you know what that shows us that we can't just be casual about these things we we we can't just treat these things as another church service and and and uh just uh just something else that we're going through uh in life I I you know let maybe I can put it a little bit like this I was hearing to I I was I was listening to the prime minister of Israel uh Netanyahu and and he was giving his speech to Congress the other day and I told my wife I said listen to this man because it's not just another politician it's not just another speech it's someone that realizes that he doesn't have a choice if he if he caves into Congress if he caves in to our president if he caves in to to the pressures of the world then there are influences at work that would completely annihilate not only him not only his family but would annihilate Israel off of the map he does not have the luxury to just be casual with this speech he does not have the luxury to just treat this as a vacation he came with a passion to convey to Congress we need your weapons we need you we we we don't we you're getting them to us but we need them faster if you'll get those weapons to us faster we'll defeat the enemy faster well I you know he was passionate about that I I tell you I think of how David his father Jesse thought that he was just sending him to his Brethren to give him some cheese and see how the battle is going but when David got on the scene he seen his Brethren hiding behind rocks and he heard this great giant this Goliath this uncircumcised Philistine making his boast and his Brethren hiding and saw the man they're following who is Head and Shoulders above everyone he's hiding in his tent behind the lines and David looks around and he says is there not a cause amen who is this uncircumcised Philistine you see he came to give some cheese but he came with a passion that the same God that met me on the backside of the desert the same God that defeated the lion defeated the bear is the same God that I have a token I am an uncircumcised Israelite that I am still following the pillar of fire I have met that Pillar of Fire I am anointed by the prophet I am anointed to defeat demons in my life amen he went with a slingshot of Faith because he didn't have a choice this was not a luxury and Friends any True Believer and they are anointed to to to to defeat the Devil and we are living at the breaking the entering the pressuring in of the tribulation period we don't have the luxury to just be casual with the word we have received the word we have received what we need to bypass the tribulation to cross over those Waters uh and enter into another dimension another land uh I tell you the word that we preach is the faith released into the Bride of Jesus Christ to bring a passion Amen to defeat sickness to I tell you if someone is sick amen they're passionate about being well they realize amen that if they're going to get well they're going to have to fight the devil amen they can't take a vacation they cannot just put it off just another day it's between life and death and I tell you when you get passionate that I am the god that Health all of thy diseases then what you are doing is you are declaring war upon the Devil I'm going to fight you I'm going to fight you in the on the I'm going to fight you on land I'm going to fight you on Shore in the sea I'm going to fight you on the mountain I'm going to fight you on the valley I'm going to fight you wherever I'm going to fight you whether I feel like it I'm going to fight you whether I it doesn't matter I am in a battle yes sir Hallelujah so there you know I I've been feeling a little bit like David here lately is there not a cause hallelujah amen when we when we see the enemy all around us poking his head up and and trying to defy the armies of the Living God I I I feel in my heart that there is a cause to stand for the word and preach it preach it with conviction preach it with passion preach it as the prophet gave it to us you see I I think of how that Columbus amen it says that the prophet of of God says you remember that little story about Columbus and he says uh Christopher Columbus was given ships by the queen of Spain because in his heart he saw a vision that the world was round and he had hardly a way he could prove it he had nothing to do with but he was a man of vision he believed it and when the ship was given to him with a bunch of prisoners cowards that was his church members a bunch of pullbacks a bunch of a bunch that was discouraged and tried to discourage him just a little while longer and we'll drop off the world a serpent Will Rise From the Bottom of the Sea and wrap these little ships and pull it to the Bottom now say Brave Rover say what will you say he said sell on Sail on Sail On and On oh God give us men in the church like that I don't care what the scientific world says I don't care what the denominational world says I Take God at his word and sail on Sail on until you pass the barrier we used to in the old church here used to sing this little song like this I've cross the separating line I've left the World Behind if there ever was a time that the church needs to step across that line which separates you between faith and unbelief by sight and looking at the in unseen by faith it is now Hallelujah you see if there ever was a time it is is now amen to be a people of vision to be following what God has already Vindicated to be the word of the Lord I'll say it like this that we are living off the evidence of the land the son of man the word made flesh and dwelt Among Us in this hour we are living off the evidence that it's a good land hallelujah it's a good land heaven is is there it's a real word it's a real power it's a it's a real Christ it's There's real angels we're bumping into those angels we're bumping it it's produced a feeling within us it's it's produced an emotion within us it's produced a joy within us it's it's produced a peace within us amen what is it is the evidence of another land and I declare it's not something that we're Desiring it's something we're eating on it we're eating on Divine Healing we're eating upon renewing and refreshing from the presence of God we are feeding upon the pomegranates and the grapes and and all of the things that God has promised his bride in the last days in this land of the Holy Ghost we are possessors of a good land I tell you what I tell you what happened amen the devil got the people discouraged over there in Egypt and God got them so tied up in Egypt that when Grace came their way and Grace provided a prophet and Grace provided the pillar of fire then all of these symptoms of well you know the waters are bitter and all of these symptoms and well you know there's a red sea and symptoms of well what are we going to do about you know food and what about this and what about that symptoms just symptoms and God would come down and he would deliver them from those symptoms he would turn The Bitter Water to Sweet Water he'd rain Mana from Heaven he he would provide Quail that they they because they got tired of of of that Mana from Heaven amen and God was always trying to get them past the symptoms just get them over into Faith get them over to what it really meant following the pillar of fire that I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'm the Mighty God I'm the Conqueror I'm the captain of the Lord's host but you see amen Moses was a type of law and it had to come a dispensation change they they had to fall they had to change Ministry they had to go from law to this idea that you've got something to do with it and they had to go on in to Joshua which is a type of this present day Ministry of the Holy Ghost and they had to follow the Holy Ghost into the inheritance and there they can realize it's not by my words it's not by my ability it never has been about my symptoms uh it's always been about the finished work of Calvary it's always been he paid the price to redeem me back to my inheritance and I am following this Holy Ghost uh I am following the captain of the Lord's host uh to to to take back all the devil stole from me Hall oh yeah Hittites in the land jebusites in the land Canaanites in the land Giants in the land just symptoms are you hearing me every single one of them is just another symptom jebusite is just a symptom do you realize the prophet of God would say that that I I believe he said it kind of like this he says that that symptoms are the worst thing that God has to deal with amen if he can get us past our symptoms do you know that weary is a symptom do you know that mind battles and and and starting to Cave into those pressures of those mind battles do you know that that is demon demonic oppression do you do you realize that those are symptoms do you realize how you feel in your body is just only one kind of a symptom amen but those thoughts that are telling you you can't possess and you're not good enough and you're really not an overcome and do you realize that that are that was the thoughts that kept 2 million people in that Pentecostal Wilderness and they everyone perished amen but you see there was a Joshua and a Caleb amen they steal the people can you imagine amen they were so possessed with the revelation of of the grace of God upon their lives that when two million people begin to listen to 10 preachers that were preaching a negative confession over the people and they begin to try to rise up and say no we're more than able don't listen to them don't listen to these preachers amen we are more than able to possess it we're we're living off of the evidence those are only symptoms uh but we are we're more than able to defeat those cancers we're more than able to defeat depression we're more than able to defeat anxiety in a nervous age we're more than able because God called us to be [Applause] Believers you see that land always was theirs the land was always theirs in God's forn knowledge God had saw it belonging to Israel so it didn't matter how many people possessed that land no matter how many pieces of paper they could hold up and say Worthy we're the inheritors we're the ones with the title deed amen you see Israel was not looking to their claims Israel was looking to what God Said through a prophet amen and they took that word and they would wave it up as their inheritance and say this is my title to that land you see it all they had never been there yet but yet God sent a prophet and said your name is on that land your name was given to you your your name was given this at Birth and your birth is tied to your position and now a prophet is declaring to them you've got to come up to a full age you got to begin to change what you're confessing you got to begin to change your speech uh your words uh and enter into what God has paid for take the land you see Caleb's confession never changed his his testimony never changed I I I I believe that Caleb held a revelation and that Revelation become a faith to him and he lived by his faith he prevailed by that Revelation amen you see he would go to Joshua and say Joshua you remember you remember what the prophet Moses said about me in that land now Joshua now now remember Caleb's the believer Joshua is the Holy Ghost and the believer is going to the Holy Ghost saying you remember the word that the prophet spoke concerning my life isn't that the position that every one of us is in that we are going to the Holy Ghost and saying you know you were there when the word was spoke you were there when he declared I'm Healed you were there when he declared that my children are saved you were there when he declared that everything on that mountain is my possession now I say Joshua give me my Mountain hallah you see Joshua the 14th chapter and I I just want to read this to you because it's it's so good for me Joshua 14 and verse 11 and 12 he's speaking to Joshua and Caleb is and he says yet as yet I am as strong this day 40 years later as I was in the day that Moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now for War I want you to just weigh upon those words those two words for war he knew a man remember what kept the children of Israel amen from possessing from crossing over they were scared of those anacom they were scared of those giants amen well we we be as grasshoppers in their sight they were scared of them but here Joshua here Caleb is saying my strength is just as strong as the day that Moses sent me the same that as just as the word was prophesied over me and my family I am just as a strong those naysayers those scoffers those Hypocrites they' died off but I'm still alive uh and I am here I realize it's not going to be a cakewalk I realize that God is not just going to simply just just just go before me and and you know kill all those giants amen but you see he left those giants there for me to overcome he he he he left those shines there but you see greater is he greater is he greater is the Revelation that Christ is in our midst and he's not just in this building he's in me he's in Me Greater is the revelation of Christ in me than he that is in the [Music] world you see Caleb is saying even so my strength now for war both to go out and to come in you see as long as you look at that mountain and you look at that and you get your wife together and you say now sweetheart ain't that beautiful what a beautiful mountain that's our possession my get the children together and say children this message now the prophet of God told me that's my mountain and I just want you to know children that you're an air with me this will never leave our family I want you to look at that mountain I want you to know that you're identified with it that's our inheritance and then they just simply get some chairs down and sit there Monday morning comes around and Tuesday comes around and they're still looking at that mountain boy isn't she beautiful Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday year comes year goes year after year after year and they're looking at that mountain boy no we can't eat the grapes off of that land because you know well we there are giants if they would just die if those giants would just get defeated somehow God somehow God if you if you could just defeat those giants but it's ours it's our land no as long as they looked at that mountain and as long as they never declared war upon the Devil the devil would just be content just to stay right there you see the prophet of God said they're the squatters the devil's the squ water we the one with the title deed but the devil would continue to squat the devil would just stay there as long as you let him as long as you don't declare war upon the devil he'll stay there you'll stay here but you see he's going to boast on top of that mountain he's going to flex his muscles on top of that mountain he's going to yell at you from the top of that mountain and say I'm in your position ah you can't be healed you can't have the Rapture you can't have joy you don't the Holy Ghost this these things aren't for you and just keep you pushed down in your mind you're thinking I know I should get up and Declare War I know I should fight a good fight I know I'm telling my children that's our land but I'm afraid to try I'm afraid to get up and do something about it but you see that is not the spirit that was upon Caleb because Caleb confessed the words of a prophet and said that is my land and I'm declaring war upon the Devil and I have got the strength uh it's Holy Ghost strength uh it's Rapture anointing strength uh to go out and come back in I'm not going to die I'm anointed to live H I'm not anointed to die I'm not anointed to be defeated I'm not anointed to lay prostrate before these uncircumcised Giants I'm anointed to take their heads off I am anointed to conquer my Rapture conquer my Deliverance conquer my healing in fight the good fight of the revelation of this [Music] [Applause] age Hallelujah you see you got to be passionate about overcoming got to be passionate about the word your name is on that land your name is on that promise and the prophet of God and the adoption part one would say this is the age of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming now Paul would lay it in the scripture that we are more than conquerors through Christ Jesus who gives us strength you see that's Caleb's strength that's the believer's strength you see conqueror is someone who overcomes something it's to Prevail is to defeat an opponent and the prophet would say that each son out of each Church age overcome the temptation of that age what's the Temptation the temptation just to just to blend in with the age and don't stand for the word you see our example is Jesus isn't that right when he come to the when he come to that Wilderness and and and the Holy Ghost led him into that Wilderness and and then he's hungering and and we see how that Satan begins to tempt him and and brother Bram showed us something so powerful that that we hear it so often but I wonder if it's really resonating to us the way it should amen that the brother Bram would say he didn't use any of his power yeah he didn't he didn't use any gift but he just simply said it is written oh the power of the word and this the prophet of God was saying this is for the weakest Christian that there is in this building or in the world you don't don't have to have gifts you don't have to wait till some person comes by who prays for the sick I'll go on record because there's a tape recorder taking it here and I say this that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can get the right mental attitude towards that Divine promise and the word of God will defeat the enemy any place anywhere at any time you see we got to fight sometime the guy the the devil the devil the guy that had the the dream and the devil kept saying boo and he and the devil kept getting bigger and he kept getting smaller and smaller and and then we find you know that that he began to think wait I I got to fight him sometime and so he took the word of God and said boo back to the devil and the devil begin to get smaller and the brother defeated the Devil by the word amen you you you see if the devil's trying to destroy your marriage you got to fight some time amen if the devil's trying to steal your children you got to fight him sometime if he's trying to take your if he's trying to take your happiness and your contentment and your joy well you got to fight him sometime and you fight him with the word of God the anointing is not an emotion but the anointing is taking the word of God and knowing how and when it's knowing how to defeat the Devil it's KN exactly what to do with the word in the very moment the moment and I tell you friends we are anointed of the Holy Ghost whether we feel it or we don't we are anointed for this age to defeat the Devil any place any conditions on any [Music] [Applause] ground but you see if you go to Revelations 5 we're not going to read it but we we know it very very much that o at the the opening of the word what was revealed was We Are Made hes we are made Hees not to just some things we are made hirs to all things we are possessors of all things but you see if you're going to possess it you're going to have to fight for it amen the uh uh the word said I've give you the land it's yours it's your possession why didn't he go over there and clean out all of the Philistines and so forth and and I'd say come on you got something to do too God just don't poke things down your neck you've got to believe it you've got to do some fighting as Peter cartright said to the drunker that day many of you has read uh his told him said what are you going to do here the bully said what are you going to do here said I'm going to hold a meeting said who told you said the Lord said you got to whip me first well said well if that's my job all right and done his coat beat him up got on top of him go uh get beat him in the face said I must fight if I should rain increase my courage Lord beat the guy up said you got enough said yep shook his hand come on back and got saved that's what we need you've got to do some fighting not with your fist catch it now let this so sink in your heart never forget it not with your fist but with the power of God with your testimony that's how you overcome by the blood of the lamb and your testimony tell the Devil he's got no strings tied to you you put this disease on me but Jesus Christ delivered me from it he promised it to me Hallelujah you overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony what is a testimony your report and the word of the Lord Isaiah 53 And1 says who ha believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed the prophet of God and the seal said believe the report first and the strength the arm the power of the Lord will be revealed in your life believe the report first confess the report first be a witness of this word first and then God will back you up with the strength of the Holy Ghost you see we're dealing with a defeated enemy when he was on Earth he conquered and possessed every gate the enemy had the Royal seed he promised it by the word he conquered it he conquered the Gate of sickness for us that's what he come to do he remember sick people he conquered that gate you don't have to conquer it he conquered it the other men had to conquer their own gate but you don't have to conquer it's already conquered he conquered the gates of sickness and what did he uh and what did he do when he conquered the Gate of sickness saying whatever you ask on Earth and whatever you've bound on Earth you he would bind it in heaven give us the keys to the kingdom you know what that tells me if it's already conquered if it's already defeated and he's going to bind whatever you say then you got to say what he said you've got to say the word why cry speak why do we keep coming to the border of our symptoms and not speaking and always trying to hold a conference when God has already revealed his will by his traps you are healed it's not God's will for you to be sick it's not God's will for you to have anxiety it's not for God's will for you to have nervousness it is God's will for you to have joy and speakable and full of glory and a have the peace that passive understanding dwelling within your heart it's for God's will for not the devil to pound your mind but for the word to inhabit your thoughts now he conquered death he conquered hell he conquered death and hell he conquered what the others couldn't conquer because there of the natural seed this is the spiritual seed he conquered the Gate of the grave and Rose up on the third day for our justification and now we are more than conqueror say that with me and now we are more than conquerors what are we going to do with this word we're just going to walk right into it as an inheritance oh but there's Giants who cares I'm declaring war on that giant I'm telling you friends we are not trying to just just well devil you can live in this part of my house and I'm going to live on this part of my house and I'll leave you alone if you leave me alone he's going to taunt you he's going to Haun you he's going to laugh at you you he's going to sneer at you he is going to make his post against your God sometime you're going to have to take the word of God and say I'm anointed to defeat this devil I'm anointed to defeat oppression I am anointed to to defeat depression I am anointed to defeat my symptoms this desur I friends you've got to wage [Applause] war I I you forgive me and you say well you're being I I'm being passionate about this because it's something that God has been dealing with my life I I I I I I have made a vow I've made a vow I've told the devil I'm going to Hound you every day I'm going to Hound you for my I I I just want to say this for my for dad's sake I I told I told the devil I'm going to Hound you that Dad amen I have tell just as Abraham looked at at lot and Sarah and everyone El is his possession I I I have taken you as my possession I know you're my dad but I've made a vow to the devil I'm going to Hound you I'm going to fight you I'm going to remind you that you're defeated I am reminded you that he is a Son of God he is a believer that you cannot have him you cannot take him until God is finished with him I tell you friends uh amen I I feel I'm just going to confess things I feel like I've been too nice to the devil I I I believe these things and I I preach these things I've seen God healed amen even through my prayers and in my Ministry but I have not waged war upon the Devil the way that I ought to but when I begin God begin to deal with me and I'll tell you how it began I seen Christ passion I seen how that he died that I could be healed he died so I could have my Redemptive rights restored to me he died to give me this inheritance he died with me in him and now I've been manifested in this last day with the word of God in my possession what am I going to do with it I'm going to fight him I'm going to attack him I'm going to attack those strongholds I take back everything the devil stole hallu Hall I begin to preach this it's been now a little over a month ago Hallelujah I told my wife it's okay she's been having thyroid problems and just the devil just it's just been daily attack after attack after attack I told her over a year ago I told her then whenever she started having these symptoms maybe about two years ago now two years ago I told her then I said we're not settling for it we're not signing for it by his stripes you're healed it went two years and something struck my heart when I was preaching a couple of of weeks ago I got off I I got off out of the pull pit and I I I went to her within after after church was dismissed I told her I said Lord you are my wife you're my help me God gave you to me and you are my possession and in the name of Jesus Christ I wage war upon the Devil that's been hounding you I didn't do that in into the flesh I did that under a revelation that I am the Royal Seed of Abraham and I am going to wage war against the devil that's my mountain and every inheritance that is on that mountain lay hold is it is my property and I I I tell you I begin to wage war every day I've been telling the devil Satan you're a defeated foe Satan I come against you with the word by his Tripes my wife is healed Satan give her up you got to let her go amen the other day she come to me she said Jonathan I believe it we've been having just our own little uh Revival you know there in our living room and just talking about the word and feasting on it and she said Jonathan said at night one after one service Sunday service and we're there in bed and she says Jonathan when when do I know cuz she's been taking some thyroid medication and without it her body just goes crazy and and and fights all kinds just her mind begins to shut down and can't even hardly function and just just going through so many different symptoms amen and and and she says Jonathan I believe with all my heart what you're preaching I believe I'm healed amen I I believe it I'm Waging War on the devil and she said but Jonathan how do I know when I should get off of you know should I get off and she begin to actually just break down and cry and and you know about these uh getting off the medication and things I said wait wait wait a minute we are not under law we are not playing games with the de for the devil we are don't have to prove nothing to the devil we do not have to prove that we are believers we don't have to prove nothing to him that you're healed you are healed because the word says you're healed and if you have to take that medication you continue to take that medication but when the word of the Lord drops in your heart to get off of that medication then you get off of the medication and amen you've got the backing of the Holy Ghost and I tell you I didn't even know she got off after that conversation I I I actually thought that she just continued on and she told me I it was about 4 days later she told me said Jonathan said I I feel better now than I felt when I was on the medication I tell you friends it's time to wage war on the devil I don't care I don't care I don't care for symptoms I don't care what the devil tells you it's time that you take the sword and speak speak to that mountain speak to that situation speak to those trials uh stand upon the word uh we've been restored back to a right confession right back to a pure language say what a prophet said I wish I had time to just preach these different things but I I don't have time but let me just say let me just begin to think because we've listened to the prophet so many times and how that the prophet you know this was just in his early early Christian experience and how that he had some uh some I think it was ulcers in his stomach and and and and the doctor told him says if you eat one solid food you'll die and the prophet of God seen in the word that by his stripes I am healed and he be to confess that word and said I am healed I am healed by his Tripes I am healed what was he doing he was Waging War on the devil there was a mountain that has some Giants on it but that's where his healing was so he begin to take the sword and begin to whack upon those Devils you know what happened he told his wife said you go down to the store you get me I think it is like this you you get me some beans and you get me some un onions and you give me some ham and and you make that up and and his wife said well you know one solid one solid uh uh food was going to kill you that's what the doctor said are you sure about said I am healed amen he got that food he put it to his mouth oh he says just the smell of it begin to make his his his stomach uh convulsing things and he put it down and he hit his stomach and up it come amen he he put his finger over his nose and closed his mouth and and he walk this and he swallowed it back down it went down came back up went down came back up uh went down came back up amen he finally got it to stay there until he ate the whole meal ped it up oh he was having an awful time walking the street what if they were saying Billy oh how you doing I'm doing well there he was St same symptoms same pain same discomfort same devil hounding his mind you know you're going to die you know you're not healed you know you're a liar amen but here but you see the prophet said I wasn't lying I was saying what the word said not what my symptom says no what my mind says I was taking my Mountain I tell you friends that's more than just a story back in 1950 that is a story it is a witness it's a testimony he trained us how to fight he trained us how to hold the word in our hand yes sir he trained us how to have a positive confession even when our own body has a negative confession you see everything is defeated Hebrews 10:23 let's let's pull this up can I go just a little bit further Hebrews 10 and 23 let us hold fast hold fast is don't let it go hold fast the profession or the confession of our faith what is Faith a revelation of the Divine will of God for our lives so hold fast the confession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised don't let it go if you ever said one time God's healed me don't let it go if God is already said that he's given you your children Don't Let It Go Hallelujah fight him with it hallu the prophet of God says whack him if he doesn't move whack him again if he doesn't move whack him again and then Whack Him whack whack whack you got to be like the unjust judge amen and the and that and that widow woman you got to knock and then you got to knock some more and you got to knock some more and you got to have a determination you got to have a press about you you got you got to have a desperation amen you got to have a confidence in the love of God that he's not going to turn you away you got to say Lord I'm on your hands Jesus I'm on your hands the devil tries to turn you back but I'm on God's hands he tries to say oh you know it ain't going to happen I'm on God's hands he tries to get you to go oh this report and that report but God I'm on your hands huah let me just the prophet of God read Hebrews 3 And1 that he's the high priest of our confession he says I'm not saved tonight because I get happy and Shout that's that isn't it I'm not saved because the gift of God works through me I'm saved because I have met the conditions that Jesus required from me I'm saved according to the Bible and not because I feel like I'm saved Satan can whip you around the stump on your feelings but he can't when it's thus sayith the Lord he can't wait across that that'll defeat him now when you now now when you believe you were saved sitting out in your in your in your seat out in the wherever you was you accepted and begin to confess and tell people you were saved well you kept on saying I'm saved the people said they ain't no difference in you but you believe there was and you kept with your confession and after a while it worked righteousness all your neighbors and everybody knows you're saved now because you believed it you confessed it what happened what changed you he's the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father making good what you're confessing now that's the same thing it is by healing you accept him as your healer renounce your feelings it's not by feelings it's by faith say you're healed believe you're healed act like you're healed associate with those who believe in healing and God will bring you right out to a perfect soundness of health will not fail you know what that what what that is material for it's a sword all right to whack the devil with this it's a sword it's the word of God that he's put in your heart and in your mouth to defeat the Devil with we have to confess it first before he can be a high priest cuz he only intercedes to our confession is that right Minister Brethren he only intercedes Upon Our confession what we confess what he is what he has done for us not what he will do he has already done it we have to confess that he's done it he was wounded for our transgressions and with his stripes we were healed amen now can I go just a little bit further are you sure I you sure abely you see confession is to say the same thing as isn't that right but the random would show us that a stone is a confession he would ask his disciples who do men say that I the son of man am and Peter would say thou art the Christ and then Peter would say Upon This Rock this uh uh he would tell Peter Upon This Rock I'll build my church and it was not Peter but it was the confession of who Christ is the revelation of who Christ is is the rock that he's going to build his church upon now the prophet of God would say what good is a confession without a stonemason to shape that confession amen you see what good is a stone if there isn't a stonemason there to shape him into a Son of God Amen you you you see what good is a confession if you don't have a stone Mason which is the prophet a stone Mason to take the word and shape your confession to what he says praise the Lord you see if you if if you're a stone Mason our brother works with stone and and but what good is Stone if you just got it in a pile and you and you look at those Stone and our brother looks and says yep there's potential there but it just stays as as a pile yeah but you see it's someone I would look at that pile and say well I it ain't going to do me no good but you see our brother can look at that and and have a vision and say I can make that stone fit this way and I can make that stone fit this way and I can do it this and Chip and here and do all these things and you see it that's what God through his word is doing is shaping our confession to say the same thing that God has already Vindicated in this hour tell me where in in the in this message where he said you're Defeated come on tell me one place in this message that he says that we are to have a defeated mentality tell me in this word in this message that we believe that we are to have our heads hanging down low and our shoulder stumped and barely getting by and wondering if we're going to ever make it and is God going to fail us and where's the money going to come from and the economy here and economy there and the world's falling apart we know all of those things but the prophet never brought us to that he brought us to a perfect revelation of who he is and who we are in this [Applause] word you see you're just he's got to shape us into sons of God you're just piling up a bunch of rocks isn't that right it's it it isn't doing a bit of good the water wearth away the stone that's right that's the people what good is Stones if you haven't got a true stonemason with a good sharp tool to shape him into The Fitting Place in the house of God you see the prophet of God would go on and say that's end time evangelism taking the stones and shaping them what good would the stones be if you just pile them up and and you see there was some there was some uh fanaticals one time amen and they recognized Messiah was in their midst they recognized that who Jesus was when he was riding on that donkey and they begin to cry who Hosanna Hosanna to the highest and and and begin to praise His name and and and in that in that system that system they they hated Christ amen they couldn't recognize who he really was amen they they couldn't identify that he was the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us they couldn't understand the redeeming work of the Lamb amen so they just he just sent things said to the disciples you know uh uh uh make them be quiet make them be silent amen they're they're bothering us but you see Jesus said if they hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out you see I I think that he was probably looking at a pile of ston scattered all around there but you see it was more than just rocks but he'll raise up True Confessions he'll raise up true sons of God that are that are identified with Christ the word that will confess Christ the word that will defeat Satan by the power and authority of the word God will raise these Stones up hallelujah look what he said to Peter or to when John dealing with those that same system they say well Abraham is our father and Abra and and John said don't think that Abraham is your father don't say that for God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham you see the prophet of God said Christ set me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word the prophet of God again and it would say 1 Corinthians 4:20 the kingdom of God is his word made Power if you want to put that down 1 Corinthians 4:20 the kingdom of God is God's word may power what is the kingdom of God is within you the Kingdom's in you and when the word comes in there what does this word begin it turns itself into Power making it say just exactly what it said you can't say it says this and it says this and make it work in other words the word says this and then but you're saying it says something different it won't work that way but you've got to say exactly what that word says you see you've got to say the same thing it says that makes a confession not saying well it's polished up a little here I'll have more wisdom I'll be in better standing over here you stay with the word there it is and it makes it power amen you see that's a true confession and that's what God has predestinated the bride in the last day is is proving to Satan that we are not going to get away we're not going to deviate from that word not one one iota amen but we are going took the word in US corrects the error the the error that was in the Garden of Eden where Eve disbelieved one word but the bride of Christ believes he's the same yesterday today and forever where is the correction the correction is in our confession the correction is the word made flesh and it's now being confessed through human lips you see it's the word age and we've grown to maturity how many believe that it's the season that we're living in we're living in the Harvest Time and and we are spending every waking moment of the heat of his sunlight this vindictive message the Vindicated word knowing what is what is it doing it's it's it's it's shaping it has the power to ripen our confession you see the bride will be the final voice under her messenger she'll be the final a voice to the final age not deviating but just staying right with it so what is the message of the hour doing the word is is maturing or ripening our confession no wonder the prophet of God says that a Christian will never have a negative confession now this flesh has plenty of it but that Soul where that word is ripened that that that word we know it's a fight if we're going to reign in this flesh it's going to be a fight if we're going to if we're going to reign supreme over this flesh and over this mind we have got to take the mind of Christ the word of God and bring this under subjection this under subjection it's a battle but we fight to rain Hallelujah I I'm closing amen you see uh a baby doesn't know how to talk I when it's born I don't I don't think there's ever been a expectation that when a your baby is born I've had I've had five of them my wife has we've had five children and there's never been an expectation I don't care which one I don't care if it's the oldest all the way to the youngest that that baby is going to come out talking right and if the baby came out talking it scare you to death you would think oh God we're in trouble but you see you see you begin to take that child and and because we're here in in in the South and we're here in English or we speak English then we teach that child and Mom and Dad's you know arguing a little bit it's a challenge who can get that baby to say mama or daddy first and you're and you're just continually you don't do it immediately no you're still changing diapers you're watching the progress they're still crying and you know and going through the whole process but then after a while you're you're you're realizing that potential starting to come out and you begin to they're trying to form words or say something or and you and you begin to say mama yeah dad say mama say Dad the child's looking between you and then if you're like my wife my wife hears this mama now don't you even go there that was not mama that's I may not be a rocker scientist but you you can't pull that one over on me and then after a while they say mama and then after a while you're teaching them this is this is an apple say apple right and then they stumble around and they say apple and then hot oh hot because they're mimicking everything you're doing you say hot and they go hot you say hurt they say hurt and then and and and you're training them right with your dilet you never have to worry that that boy is going to sound like the English and you can't understand a licky saying don't have to worry about it you don't even have to worry about that they're going to have Northern dialect cuz they're in the South and you're proud of it and they begin to you know and they say y'all and bless your heart as if they're Pros right oh yeah you see you're teaching them what are they doing it's a confession right you are teaching them as they're growing into into maturity yeah the vocabulary just keeps maturing with them you see I their speech their understanding their their thinking changes as they grow into maturity you know when I went into overseas one of the first things that I went on my overseas trips it it baffled me because I think it was Ukraine and and I'm I'm hearing them speak in their dialect can't understand anything they're saying and all the sudden I hear English but it ain't just English it it it has a hillbilly slang to it and I'm thinking what in the world I turn around and here's a young person who has has come and learned English by how listening to the tapes they taught themselves English by taking a prophet's message and applying it and they sounded like him they said it the way he said it if he said it wrong they said it wrong Hallelujah and I tell you friends we have not learned Kentucky we have thus sayith the Lord we have learned how to speak this word over mountains and over over circumstances and and over demon oppressions and and fears and nervousness and anxieties and and and we have learned the vocabulary that we that Satan is defeated and you're not going to be healed you are already heal your confession brings this body sub to your confession you see we've returned back to a pure language the prophet of God let the musicians come the prophet of God would say makes this Kingdom of the devil crumble and fall turn them big blast words on thus sayeth the Lord that Atomic word of God flies out there and just disintegrate Satan's kingdom can you listen to one more quote you see the prophet of God how how how many believes what Paul says we've got to Die daily yeah every day the prophet of God would say you've got to get with the word get yourself killed out I'm persuaded that many of us friends have received the Holy Ghost but we just receive enough holy ghost in us to make us to a place where we don't want to lie we don't want to steal we don't want to do anything but what but God wants to feel every fiber of his church he wants to feel your thinking and he wants to feel your mind he wants to feel every bit of you just make you completely totally dead to yourself or to your thinking just so surrendered in God till his words just living right through you you don't know nothing else but God's word just stay right with his word it is life did you catch it stay right with his word it is life you see this is not mind over matter amen this is not mind over matter tries to tell you that well how you overcome your symptoms or you you overcome your sickness is just ignoring it and saying you don't have it but just simply saying oh it's not there you see that's that's why the prophet of God says we are not Christian Science Christian Science is mind over matter and they tried to deaden the Pain by getting your mind to not accept it getting your mind conditioned to a place that you can just go through life and say I don't have it I don't have it that's not the confession we're talking about you see the prophet of God would actually deal with this I I I I didn't know exactly how I believe he was dealing with this Christian Science and mind over matter and how can we overcome he says now you can't say it's not a real devil he says because he is a real devil he's a real person he says you can't say that you don't have cancer you do have cancer you can't say well I don't have these symptoms and I really am I no I'm no he says no first you got to recognize it's a real devil yeah you are facing challenges but he says but you've got to realize you've got to recognize that Jesus Christ has already defeated the Devil he's already conquered and greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world so we're not just simply trying to ignore it but we believe that the word is not just coming into our mind to give us good good Positive Vibes that's not what we're looking at we are looking at the word has life and when you receive the word by free moral agency you accept the word and it's coming to the channel of your mind then that word begins to come down into your soul and it begins to clear out all the channels the channel of reason the channnel of imagination the channel of conscience the channel of what you feel and see and hear all of these senses becoming subject to the word because the word is not intellectual Faith the word is [Music] life amen and when that word sets upon the throne of your heart then the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh I just told you we are are in we are we we are we believe we are in the age of harvest right out of the abundance that abundance is meaning s Surplus super abundance abundance that was left over and above when I read that I thought Oh Glory to God we don't just have a little bit of Baptist a little bit of Luther a little bit of Pentecost we have received a full crop the Eternal Word is dwelling within your heart and it's so we are so full of the word it's just pouring out it's abundant it's just it's just we're drinking out of our saucer so to speak it's just a bumper crop it's just flowing out where is it flowing out of out of the abundance of the heart the mouth is confessing we've got so much word in us so much healing in us so much Deliverance in us so much holy ghost in us it's coming out of us I am healed I am delivered I am an overcomer I am victorious I claim my children I claim my family I apply the token over my home you're it's just coming out it's it's something that is just P being pushed out of your heart you can help it hallelujah it's because the word has become life we pray it's helped in some way you see it's something that's transforming it's something that we we we are not being conformed to the world but we are being transformed by the renewing of our mind we have received his mind what is his word it's his Minden and what is that word doing for those who have the Holy Ghost the word is the transforming power to mold you into a Son of God but not just a Son of God to say oh yeah I'm a Christian oh yeah no an adopted son of God a mature Son of God the prophet of God would I I just listening to this and why Christ says I I hope it's all right to say this but the prophet of God says we need a real repentance you see are we looking at that mountain and we've come to the age to speak we've come to the age that we've got to have confidence in the word we've got to have we've come to the age of maturity that we are passionate about that word where else can we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life then are we running from the Red Sea are we are we doubting or purpose are we doubting our commission because the prophet of God says I need a Revival I was just listening to this said I I I need a repentance I thought oh God because this is the age if there is an ever a time that repentance is activated in our life daily daily are we giving in to this feeling are we giving in to this emotion are we giving in to this reasoning are are we thinking something that we're not supposed to be thinking are you are y'all following me when when we entertain things and then if you're not careful you begin to confess it that is not God's will for our [Music] lives but oh God let us cast down reasoning cast down feelings cast down those things that are always trying to rise above the rise above the power of God Amen Die daily so the word can have prividence hallelujah amen we pray it's helping some way what are you [Music] playing you oh one by one [Music] by take the word of God what you see what you [Music] believe is what will be set your wings to The Winds of Faith you
