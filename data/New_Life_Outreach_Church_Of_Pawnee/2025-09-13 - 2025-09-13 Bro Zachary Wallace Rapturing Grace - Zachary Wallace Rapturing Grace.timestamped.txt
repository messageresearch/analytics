[13:14] our our services thus far?
[13:16] &gt;&gt; My haven't they been good?
[13:20] Amen. I don't have any any written
[13:23] needs. I do I do know our pastor,
[13:25] brother Ben Beard, um I believe is it's
[13:28] not feeling well here this morning. He's
[13:30] here, but he said he's been puking his
[13:32] guts out. So, let's re remember brother
[13:34] Ben Beard here this morning. And let's
[13:37] remember the man of God. Amen. That the
[13:38] Lord just anoint and use him here this
[13:41] morning. And if you have a need upon
[13:42] your heart, just make a known by the
[13:44] lifting of your hand. God bless you.
[13:45] Now,
[13:48] let's all just pray.
[13:50] Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we
[13:52] just approach your throne again this
[13:53] morning,
[13:55] Lord, and we just can't thank you enough
[13:58] for the opportunity that we can gather
[13:59] ourselves together here as believers,
[14:01] Lord. And
[14:03] your scripture says that if there's two
[14:05] or three that are gathered together in
[14:06] your name, that you'll be here in our
[14:07] midst, Lord. And the God of gods, the
[14:09] King of Kings, the Lord of Lords would
[14:12] come down into our presence. And Lord,
[14:13] we know that when you come, Lord,
[14:14] there's a purpose when you come.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; You don't just come out of a whim, but
[14:18] you come for a purpose, Lord. And we're
[14:20] just asking you, we're inviting you that
[14:21] you would just be comfortable in this
[14:23] place as we're singing these songs of
[14:25] worship, Lord. May it not just be words
[14:27] that are proceeding from our lips, Lord,
[14:28] but may it be worship coming from our
[14:30] heart. Father, we just ask that you
[14:31] would just be with the ministers he's
[14:33] preparing.
[14:34] &gt;&gt; Lord, may he just be able to get himself
[14:36] out of the way. May he just fall into
[14:37] the channel of the Holy Spirit, Lord.
[14:39] You know every need that's amongst the
[14:40] people this morning, Lord. And there's
[14:42] no way that a man could know all of
[14:44] those needs. But we know that if we
[14:45] serve a living God, Lord, you can come
[14:47] down and show yourself real amongst us
[14:49] this morning. Lord, we just ask that you
[14:51] would be with our uh pastor Ben, Lord,
[14:53] as he's not feeling very well. Father,
[14:56] we just ask that even now you would just
[14:57] go down and touch him. Lord, we know
[14:59] that you're the great physician, Father.
[15:00] There's no medicine, there's no doctor
[15:02] that could heal him, but only you can
[15:04] heal him, Father.
[15:05] &gt;&gt; Lord, we're also looking for healing in
[15:07] our hearts, healing in our souls,
[15:08] healing in our body. Father, we just ask
[15:10] that you would touch each and everyone.
[15:12] Have your hand upon the service. We ask
[15:13] in Jesus name. Amen.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; Thank you.

[25:52] we? Amen.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning.
[25:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm not going to sing, but I do
[26:00] just want to kind of share a testimony.
[26:02] This is that's what this song is about.
[26:04] Um, many of you know us, but uh my wife
[26:08] and I were married for 10 years trying
[26:11] to have a child and praying. And uh I
[26:15] know that uh some people are, you know,
[26:18] still waiting on a promise. And and if
[26:19] you've ever been through something like
[26:21] that where you you just don't know how
[26:23] long it's going to be. You know, God
[26:24] told Abraham, "I'm going to give you a
[26:26] child by Sarah, but he didn't say it was
[26:27] going to be 25 years." And so, um, it's
[26:30] a trial. But I want to just encourage
[26:33] you this morning that his ways are
[26:35] higher than ours. And that his word is
[26:38] still true. His promises that he makes
[26:41] are still going to come to pass. He's
[26:43] faithful. So, just if you know this
[26:46] song, worship with us. But uh I just
[26:48] want to say you know the Lord promised
[26:50] us a a child and he's sitting over here
[26:52] in the in the audience today and and the
[26:54] Lord even blessed us with two. So we
[26:56] appreciate God that he is faithful to
[26:58] his word.
[26:59] [Applause]
[27:07] [Music]
[27:18] It's not what I prayed for. It's not
[27:23] what I wanted.
[27:26] It's not something I understand.
[27:33] [Music]
[27:35] My circumstances
[27:39] seem so confusing.
[27:41] [Music]
[27:43] Placing it all in your head.

[50:03] You know, every one of us are have been
[50:06] built with a little something on the
[50:08] inside of us called that soul that only
[50:11] Jesus can feel.
[50:14] And a lot of people have tried to fill
[50:16] it with religion, going to church, being
[50:19] religious.
[50:21] But there's nothing that can fill that
[50:24] except that relationship with the Lord
[50:27] as these two preachers that have been
[50:29] that have already ministered this week
[50:31] to us. It's got to be a living reality,
[50:34] a reality of Jesus,
[50:37] a living Christ, not an idol, but a
[50:40] living God.
[50:42] And I'm so thankful
[50:45] the Lord Jesus has filled that place
[50:49] within our hearts.
[50:51] Bless the name of the Lord.

[52:31] And we're not we're not serving a dead
[52:34] idol, but God has come. We we have
[52:36] prostrated oursel before a living God.
[52:39] God is now living in us, living his life
[52:42] through us. Oh, what a tremendous
[52:45] message that was. And so this morning we
[52:48] have brother Zack Wallace. And um
[52:50] Brother Zach is not a stranger here to
[52:52] our church. He's he's been preaching for
[52:55] us for uh years and and is a tremendous
[52:59] blessing. and and he's one of our
[53:01] favorites around here. And um so we're
[53:04] we're looking forward to having brother
[53:06] brother Zachary to minister the word of
[53:08] the Lord. And you pull on the gift. I
[53:11] know it's a Saturday morning and
[53:12] sometimes we can be a little bit tart,
[53:15] but I believe that God's got something
[53:17] in store for me.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; And he's got a little extra for you.
[53:22] Amen. And uh I I I just believe that.

[54:00] Lord.
[54:02] I lift
[54:05] it up,
[54:08] Lord.
[54:12] Come and quench
[54:17] this thirst
[54:19] in
[54:21] my soul.
[54:24] Oh,
[54:26] [Music]
[54:28] bread of heaven.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[54:33] feed me.
[54:40] [Music]
[54:49] up and make me home.
[54:56] [Music]
[54:57] Amen. It's just a wonderful morning to
[55:00] be a Christian,
[55:02] &gt;&gt; to be serving the Lord,
[55:04] &gt;&gt; to have your your heart right and your
[55:06] life ready for the coming of the Lord.
[55:09] It's just a wonderful thing to be
[55:12] together with saints of like precious
[55:14] faith.
[55:16] You know, when I wake up in the morning,
[55:18] I wake up happy. My wife doesn't
[55:20] appreciate that as much, but when I wake
[55:22] up, I wake up happy. I'm happy to be
[55:24] awake and happy for another day, another
[55:27] day to serve the Lord. And you know,
[55:29] this morning I woke up and I woke up and
[55:31] I had a smile on my face. Another day.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; All right.
[55:33] &gt;&gt; And then that smile started to fade. I
[55:35] said, "Oh, this day
[55:39] Saturday morning." And uh you know,
[55:41] honestly, the first thought I had was,
[55:43] "I wonder if I lost my voice. You know,
[55:45] maybe I can get out of this." But you
[55:48] know, if the Lord doesn't show up, it
[55:51] there's there's really no point in
[55:53] standing here.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; But if he'll come
[55:57] &gt;&gt; and he can say something,
[56:00] &gt;&gt; oh, it'll make all the difference.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; So, let's just talk to the Lord this
[56:04] morning.
[56:05] Heavenly Father, we just love you, Lord.
[56:09] Lord, and we want this to be your
[56:10] service, Lord. We want you to be welcome
[56:13] to move among us. We want you to have
[56:15] your way and just to speak to our
[56:17] hearts, Lord. Speak personally, Lord.
[56:20] May it not be these lips that speak, but
[56:22] may it be you that speaks through us,
[56:24] Lord. And may you just give ears to hear
[56:26] this morning, Lord. It's only you that
[56:28] can give the ear to hear, Lord. And may
[56:30] they receive the word on the inside,
[56:32] Lord. May we be edified and built up
[56:34] into that stature, Lord, that you are
[56:36] calling us to, Father. May we accept and
[56:38] receive your word this morning. And
[56:40] Lord, if there's anything in my heart,
[56:42] Lord, or in the congregation that might
[56:45] hinder you, Lord. Father, I ask that the
[56:48] blood of Jesus Christ would just come
[56:50] and purify and cleanse, Lord, to to make
[56:52] hearts that are ready to receive and a
[56:55] voice that can speak. Father, we just
[56:57] commit ourselves to you now and ask you
[56:59] would open up your word to our hearts in
[57:02] Jesus name. Amen.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:07] [Music]
[57:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:13] Let's turn over to Job the 38th chapter.
[57:15] Just making sure everybody was awake
[57:17] there. And
[57:19] &gt;&gt; if you're asleep, that's all right. I
[57:21] can always come and shake your hand,
[57:23] wake you up. Don't worry about it.
[57:26] I've done that.
[57:29] Figure if I put him to sleep, I ought to
[57:31] wake him up.
[57:36] Job 38. Uh
[57:39] portion of scripture here that we
[57:40] probably all know by heart, but Job 38
[57:44] and verse4
[57:46] says after Job has been through a lot of
[57:48] hard times and he's in fact he's he's
[57:50] still in the middle of it.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; He's still in the middle of an ash
[57:53] sheep. He's still got trials on every
[57:54] side, but God comes down to talk to him.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; He says, "Where was thou when I laid the
[58:00] foundations of the earth? Declare if
[58:03] thou hast understanding." Verse five,
[58:05] "Who hath laid the measures thereof, if
[58:08] thou knowest, or who hath stretched a
[58:09] line upon it? Whereupon are the
[58:12] foundations thereof fastened? Or who
[58:14] laid the cornerstone thereof?"
[58:16] &gt;&gt; When the morning stars sang together,
[58:19] and all,
[58:20] &gt;&gt; yes, sir,
[58:21] &gt;&gt; all
[58:23] The sons of God shouted for joy.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, that blessed me to see that.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians chapter 4.
[58:35] First Thessalonians 4 and 15.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; You know, when when you read the word of
[58:44] God, you've got to identify your
[58:47] portion. You know, there's a portion
[58:49] that says that the that that tempter
[58:51] Lucifer, that old devil is going to be
[58:53] cast into the lake of fire.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; That's not my verse.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; That's not my promise. That's his
[59:00] promise.
[59:01] &gt;&gt; You got to see yourself identified. And
[59:03] when I see sons of God shouting for joy,
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; And it says all,
[59:08] &gt;&gt; that was me.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians 4 and 15. And here's a
[59:13] little more about about me as far as I'm
[59:16] concerned.
[59:18] 1 Thessalonians 4:15.
[59:22] For this we say unto you by the word of
[59:25] the Lord, that we which are alive and
[59:27] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[59:29] not prevent them which are asleep. For
[59:32] the Lord himself shall descend from
[59:34] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[59:36] the archangel, and with the trump of
[59:37] God, and the dead in Christ shall rise
[59:40] first. Then we we which are alive and
[59:45] remain and shall be caught up together
[59:47] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[59:49] in the air. And so shall we ever be with
[59:52] the Lord.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; Wherefore comfort ye one another with
[59:57] these words
[59:58] &gt;&gt; can be seated this morning.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; For a for a topic I I'd like to speak on
[1:00:03] rapturing grace.
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; And uh I just want to to look at the
[1:00:08] grace of God this morning in in the
[1:00:10] context of a rapture. and also
[1:00:11] recognizing that this is the hour we're
[1:00:13] living in. We're living in the age of
[1:00:15] rapture. We're living in a rapturing
[1:00:17] age. We're living in a bride age. We're
[1:00:19] living at the time that these scriptures
[1:00:21] are to be fulfilled. That scripture has
[1:00:23] been laying there for over 2,000 years.
[1:00:25] It's been laying there. It's been laying
[1:00:26] there. But there's come a time when that
[1:00:28] word that's been spoken has to anchor
[1:00:30] into a soul to bring a manifestation to
[1:00:33] what has been prophesied. There was a
[1:00:35] there was a prophecy made by Isaiah and
[1:00:37] he said, "Behold, a virgin shall
[1:00:39] conceive." And that word went out and it
[1:00:41] just went out and it went out and it was
[1:00:43] waiting. It was waiting until finally it
[1:00:45] anchored in the womb of a virgin and it
[1:00:48] manifested the prophecy. And there has
[1:00:50] to be a people somewhere that's going to
[1:00:53] manifest the prophecy of First
[1:00:55] Thessalonians 4. Somebody's going to
[1:00:57] manifest that. Somebody's going to
[1:00:59] fulfill there's going to be somebody
[1:01:00] that was a pre-ordained, predestinated
[1:01:02] vessel that that word was going to
[1:01:04] anchor into to manifest the bride.
[1:01:08] and that's this hour.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; But you know, there's many people they
[1:01:11] they they don't recognize the hour we're
[1:01:14] living in. They don't recognize what's
[1:01:15] happening because it's the nature of
[1:01:17] man. He always thanks God for what he
[1:01:19] did and he looks forward what he's going
[1:01:21] to do and he misses what's happening
[1:01:23] right now in 2025. He misses what God's
[1:01:27] doing.
[1:01:28] Now, to to lay a little background here,
[1:01:30] Brother Brandham talking 1959 to to
[1:01:33] Brother Duffield and Brother Duplicus,
[1:01:35] and he says, "I wish there was some way
[1:01:36] I could let the people see what I'm
[1:01:38] talking about. We've got to have
[1:01:40] awakening right quick or you're going to
[1:01:44] miss the rapture." He says, "Friends, it
[1:01:46] could happen at any time." And so, I
[1:01:48] want to deal with that concept of
[1:01:50] missing the rapture. All right? He says,
[1:01:52] "Listen, brothers, you you they were
[1:01:53] Pentecostal brothers, leaders, they were
[1:01:55] great men." He says, "Listen, you got to
[1:01:57] wake up. You got to wake up or you're
[1:01:59] going to miss the rapture.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Now, over here in in questions and
[1:02:07] answers, he says, "Oh, they've got
[1:02:08] millions of or uh this is the third
[1:02:10] seal." He says, "They got millions of
[1:02:11] church members and but no revival
[1:02:13] nowhere." And he says the bride hasn't
[1:02:15] had a revival yet. He says there's been
[1:02:17] no revival, no manifestation of God to
[1:02:20] stir the bride yet, but we're looking
[1:02:22] for it now. And it'll take those seven
[1:02:24] un thunders back there to wake her up
[1:02:26] again. See? Yeah. He said he'd send it.
[1:02:29] He promised it. So, so we look at these
[1:02:31] things. We're like, "Oh, well, we don't
[1:02:32] want to miss the rapture. We don't want
[1:02:33] to miss the rapture someday. There's
[1:02:35] going to be a bride's revival someday."
[1:02:37] And and they're looking for it somewhere
[1:02:39] else. They're looking for it somewhere
[1:02:40] in the distance. But when he's saying
[1:02:42] this here, there there's got to be a
[1:02:44] bride's revival somewhere. It's in the
[1:02:46] third seal,
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; which makes all the difference.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; He says he says it's got to be there. He
[1:02:52] says those seven thunders, it's going to
[1:02:53] take that to to really bring that
[1:02:55] bride's revival.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; And then you go over to questions and
[1:02:58] answers and they ask about what about
[1:03:00] these seven thunders? He said, "Oh,
[1:03:01] well, they were revealed in the seven
[1:03:03] seals. That's what the thunders was
[1:03:05] about."
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; So, as he's saying, there's going to be
[1:03:09] a bride's revival. You've We're looking
[1:03:11] for it. We're looking for it. It's
[1:03:12] taking place. It's being broke forth.
[1:03:15] It's happening right then. But people
[1:03:17] still in this day are looking for it
[1:03:19] somewhere else. Looking for it in some
[1:03:20] other time. But I say this day, this
[1:03:23] scripture has been fulfilled. There is a
[1:03:25] bride of Jesus Christ and she's not
[1:03:27] worried about missing the rapture
[1:03:28] because she is the rapture.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, this bride's revival isn't
[1:03:34] somewhere out there some other time. If
[1:03:36] this book was not open, then it would be
[1:03:38] for some other day. It would be for some
[1:03:40] other time. But we're living in the day
[1:03:42] when the word has come open and the
[1:03:44] bride's revival has been unleashed upon
[1:03:46] the earth. That's right.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; So to say it very plain, the opening of
[1:03:50] the word is the bride's revival. The
[1:03:52] opening of the word is the awakening of
[1:03:54] this bride out of dark
[1:03:55] denominationalism. There has been a
[1:03:58] resurrection again to life. And it's the
[1:04:00] same type of resurrection as when Jesus
[1:04:02] came out of the grave. It's the same
[1:04:04] one. It's the same one that went down
[1:04:06] into the grave is the same life that's
[1:04:08] come back out in this last age
[1:04:10] manifesting Jesus Christ, the word made
[1:04:13] flesh.
[1:04:14] That's right.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says, you know, that that we've
[1:04:17] got to got to have this awakening. And
[1:04:19] he says, or we we might miss the
[1:04:20] rapture. Well, the awakening's happened.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; So, he says, we've got to have an
[1:04:26] awakening so we don't miss it.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; But if the awakening's happened,
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; you going to miss it.
[1:04:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, no. Oh, no. Not going to happen. The
[1:04:36] awakening of the bride has already taken
[1:04:39] place. She can't miss it. and and like
[1:04:43] we could look at a uh when I I get to
[1:04:45] travel a little bit doing uh mission
[1:04:47] work overseas and and so I've been on
[1:04:49] hundreds of planes now and and you know
[1:04:52] the first plane flight was really
[1:04:53] exciting but
[1:04:55] now it's just another trial but you know
[1:04:58] you get on that plane and and you know
[1:05:00] before before the flight I'm leaving out
[1:05:02] actually um Monday morning 5 in the
[1:05:04] morning we head to the airport get there
[1:05:06] and I'm not going to sleep good Sunday
[1:05:08] night because I got a plane to catch. I
[1:05:10] got a plane to catch. Oh, I mean I don't
[1:05:13] want to miss that flight. And so I set
[1:05:14] alarm and then I set a timer and then I
[1:05:16] set another alarm because I don't want
[1:05:18] to miss it.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; You see, there's this there's this
[1:05:20] nervous tension. I don't want to miss
[1:05:22] that flight. And so I set all my alarms.
[1:05:24] I want to make sure I I wake up for it
[1:05:26] and I get all that ready and and then
[1:05:28] we're going to the airport and I try to
[1:05:29] leave with plenty of time to get there
[1:05:30] so that I won't be late. And we we get
[1:05:32] there and I'm making sure there's no
[1:05:33] traffic jam. I don't want anything to
[1:05:35] keep me from making on that flight. And
[1:05:37] so I prepare. I lay aside things. You
[1:05:38] say, "Oh, well, I could have a little
[1:05:40] bit of time for that." I was like, "It's
[1:05:41] not worth it. It's not worth it. I got
[1:05:42] to make it on that flight. I got a place
[1:05:44] to go." And so I I move everything out
[1:05:46] of the way. We get there and I get there
[1:05:48] early and I'm just sitting there. I'm
[1:05:49] waiting and I'm get I get to the gate. I
[1:05:51] go through security. It's like, "Okay,
[1:05:52] another check mark where we're past
[1:05:53] that. We're past that. We've gone past
[1:05:55] that barrier. We've gone past that
[1:05:56] barrier." And I'm I'm just sitting at
[1:05:58] the gate, you know, but I'm still I I
[1:06:00] missed a flight one time sitting at the
[1:06:01] gate, you know, and I'm like, "No, it's
[1:06:03] not it's not time to relax yet. You
[1:06:05] can't let your guard down yet, you know.
[1:06:06] I I got to get on that plane. But you
[1:06:09] know what?
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; When I get past all those barriers, when
[1:06:13] I get past everything and I get on that
[1:06:15] plane and then I go to my seat where I
[1:06:18] have a ticket, I have a token with my
[1:06:20] name on it and I go to my seat. I get in
[1:06:23] my position and when I'm sitting there,
[1:06:25] the worry is over, friends. The
[1:06:27] concern's over. I'm in my position. I'm
[1:06:30] just waiting. And when that plane's
[1:06:32] going down the runway, I'm not saying
[1:06:34] I'm worried. I wonder. I can feel the
[1:06:36] power vibrating. I can feel the
[1:06:38] pulsation. I know where it's taking me.
[1:06:40] The fear is over. I am resting in my
[1:06:44] position.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not worried about missing it. I
[1:06:50] can feel the pulsation. I can feel that
[1:06:52] pulsation of a heavenly realm. I'm
[1:06:55] already on board this Holy Ghost power
[1:06:57] that's taking me into the plus. Guys,
[1:06:59] it's no more fear. It's rest.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Resting. in God's election.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Now, if you don't got a ticket this
[1:07:11] morning,
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; there's a way to get one.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; If you don't have a ticket with your
[1:07:17] name on it, it's called the token, the
[1:07:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I invite you
[1:07:22] to come and to see a ticketing agent
[1:07:24] this morning and get your ticket. Get
[1:07:26] your token. Because without that, you
[1:07:28] could show up and say, "Hey, I got a lot
[1:07:30] of money. I did a lot of good deeds. I
[1:07:32] did all these things.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; They don't care.
[1:07:35] Give me the token. Without that token,
[1:07:37] you are not getting on that flight. But
[1:07:39] with that ticket, you know, sometimes
[1:07:41] they'll leave a flight, a flight will
[1:07:42] take off and they'll leave some people
[1:07:43] behind because, you know, they just
[1:07:44] didn't get there in time.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; This plane isn't that way.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; You know, there's sometimes they they'll
[1:07:51] they'll book a flight and they'll
[1:07:52] overbook the flight because they say,
[1:07:53] "Ah, some people might miss it. I don't
[1:07:55] know. We want to try to get as many
[1:07:56] people as possible in the bride, so
[1:07:57] we'll just oversell it." And then and
[1:07:59] then maybe, you know, some people enough
[1:08:01] will show up to make a make a bride.
[1:08:04] Come on.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; No. No. This flame, this trip to glory
[1:08:07] isn't going to have one empty seat.
[1:08:09] There's not going to be one person
[1:08:11] missing from this rapture. Every
[1:08:13] ticketed passenger will be in their
[1:08:15] position and we'll be ready to take off.
[1:08:18] You don't have to worry. You don't have
[1:08:20] to fear, little bride. You just can hear
[1:08:22] the words shalom. Be at peace. Be at
[1:08:25] rest. God's got this plan figured out.
[1:08:29] Oh, you know that the the the peace and
[1:08:32] the rest that comes when you realize
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; your identity,
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; your position.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; You got to have an identity to get on
[1:08:41] that plane. Friends,
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; you're you're not going in this rapture
[1:08:44] and saying, "Oh, I don't think that's
[1:08:46] me. No, that's not me. That's not me."
[1:08:47] You know, there comes a time when you
[1:08:49] say, "You see this?
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; It's me.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; You see this identification? You see
[1:08:54] that this this word that's been given?
[1:08:56] You look at that. You look at that. See
[1:08:58] that? That's me. You can see I am the
[1:09:00] reflection. I am the manifestation of
[1:09:03] that identification.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's a it's an exciting thing when
[1:09:08] you realize that you don't have to worry
[1:09:10] about it. You don't have to work it up.
[1:09:12] You don't have to manufacture it. You
[1:09:14] just have to match the identification.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; I never go to that airport and say, "I
[1:09:22] hope I look like Zachary today."
[1:09:26] I don't go, "Okay, let me let me me hold
[1:09:27] my breath just right. Let me stand just
[1:09:29] right so so I look like
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; I'm not an impersonator.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; It's just who I am."
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother talks about this group and
[1:09:43] they're fasting and praying, hoping for
[1:09:45] a revival, calling for a revival. They
[1:09:47] says, "Oh, fast and pray. It's not too
[1:09:48] late yet." And he says, "Why are they
[1:09:50] doing that? Why do they do that? They
[1:09:53] want a great awakening and they're
[1:09:54] crying believing there will be an
[1:09:55] awakening. And they're good people. But
[1:09:57] why is it? What have they done? They
[1:10:00] have not recognized the awakening of the
[1:10:02] bride. But being a Christian, they feel
[1:10:04] the pull of the hour. But they haven't
[1:10:07] recognized what's been done.
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, they have not recognized what's been
[1:10:12] done, but they feel the pull. They feel
[1:10:13] that call. They hear it. They they they
[1:10:15] know there's something there, and
[1:10:16] they're looking for something that's
[1:10:18] actually taking place right amongst
[1:10:20] them. He says they haven't recognized
[1:10:22] what's h already happened right by you.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; And I say to you that it could be
[1:10:26] happening right in you.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; But it's God in such a humble simple way
[1:10:32] expressing himself and you're looking
[1:10:34] for some great exciting mystical thing
[1:10:37] when it's God revealed in humility and
[1:10:40] in simplicity in your very life, in your
[1:10:42] very heart, and you're looking for
[1:10:44] something that's not actually what he
[1:10:46] prophesied. And so you you get this
[1:10:48] idea, oh, it's going to be like this.
[1:10:50] this is going to be like this. No, no,
[1:10:51] no, no.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Don't look for it that way. Don't look
[1:10:54] for us to be running around and emptying
[1:10:56] out all the hospitals and and having
[1:10:58] public television series where everybody
[1:10:59] can see the great and the mighty guy
[1:11:01] that that this person is. No. No. That's
[1:11:04] human thinking.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; What God calls great,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; man calls foolish. And what man calls
[1:11:11] foolish, God calls great.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; You can go down through the scriptures a
[1:11:15] hundred different places and you can see
[1:11:17] that expression. But you see, God, when
[1:11:19] he's doing this bride, when he's
[1:11:20] bringing forth this bride, it's
[1:11:22] beautiful in his sight.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; It's great and it's mighty in his sight.
[1:11:27] And you've got to get into his thinking.
[1:11:29] You got to get under the anointing of
[1:11:30] the message of the hour and see it the
[1:11:32] way he sees it. Otherwise, you'll be
[1:11:34] looking at it through eyes of flesh and
[1:11:36] you'll miss it by 100 miles.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Now, prophet tells us there's got to be
[1:11:41] a rapture. He says, "If there's not a
[1:11:43] rapture, friends, then where are we at?
[1:11:45] What are we going to do? What age are we
[1:11:47] living in? What promises do we have?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; He says, "But there's going to be a
[1:11:52] rapture."
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible says there will be, and it'll
[1:11:56] only be for the elected, the elected
[1:11:58] lady, the bride in this day that's
[1:12:01] pulled out the church.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; He says we're living up here in the
[1:12:06] bride age, the calling out of the church
[1:12:08] and getting it together for the rapture.
[1:12:10] That's the age that we're living in.
[1:12:12] Amen.
[1:12:13] &gt;&gt; Now, we're we're not looking for someday
[1:12:16] to have an invisible union.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; No, it's not someday. Sometime I'll
[1:12:22] finally be united with Christ. No. No.
[1:12:24] That is something that is already a
[1:12:27] reality. The bride is already united
[1:12:29] with Christ. She has already come in an
[1:12:31] invisible union. You say, "Well, why
[1:12:33] haven't I seen it?"
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; Invisible union.
[1:12:38] &gt;&gt; It's not a public show.
[1:12:42] Prophecy says it in that day that the
[1:12:44] son of man will be revealed. He says
[1:12:45] what? To join the church to the head.
[1:12:48] Unite the marriage of the bride. The
[1:12:50] bridegroom call will come right through
[1:12:52] this. When the son of man will come down
[1:12:55] and come in human flesh to unite the two
[1:12:57] together. The church has to be the word.
[1:13:01] He is the word and the two unites
[1:13:03] together. And to do that it'll take the
[1:13:05] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:13:07] son of man, not a clergyman. Come on.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says, "Do you see what I mean?
[1:13:12] See, it's the son of man, Jesus Christ,
[1:13:15] will come down in human flesh among us,
[1:13:18] and will make his word so real that
[1:13:20] it'll unite the church and him as one,
[1:13:24] the bride. And then she'll go home to
[1:13:26] the wedding supper. She's already
[1:13:28] united. See, we go to the wedding
[1:13:30] supper, not to the marriage." So, right
[1:13:33] now is the time for the marriage
[1:13:35] relationship. Right now is the time for
[1:13:37] the uniting of Christ and the bride. Not
[1:13:39] someday, not some future tense, but
[1:13:42] right now is the time for you and
[1:13:44] Christ. You and the word to become one.
[1:13:47] This is the hour for the manifestation
[1:13:49] of the sons of God. This is the hour for
[1:13:51] you, the bride, to be manifested as the
[1:13:54] word. Not some other day, not some other
[1:13:56] time,
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; this day.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, but you know, I'm not good
[1:14:02] enough or I can't I the the bride I I
[1:14:06] don't know how I could ever be, you
[1:14:07] know, that perfect, that righteous, and
[1:14:09] and could you give me that little
[1:14:11] picture? Uh I I would normally probably
[1:14:14] build this out of wood and bring it to
[1:14:16] church, but I'm trying to be a little
[1:14:17] more dignified today. But um you know,
[1:14:21] we look at we see a person, we see their
[1:14:23] life, and and you know, when they first
[1:14:24] become a Christian, they first come to
[1:14:26] the Lord, they they have so much sin in
[1:14:29] their life. There's so much just just
[1:14:30] filthiness all around them, and and and
[1:14:32] they're just they're just lost in the
[1:14:34] pit of sin. But but they come and they
[1:14:36] say, "God, you know, I need help. I I
[1:14:38] need a savior." And he begins to work in
[1:14:40] their life and he begins to clean up a
[1:14:41] little bit here and a little bit there.
[1:14:43] And he begins to, you know, change these
[1:14:45] things. And that's wonderful. That's
[1:14:46] good. And and so we look at oursel and
[1:14:48] we say, "Well, you see this person over
[1:14:49] here, this this this man, he's been
[1:14:51] serving the Lord for a long time. He's
[1:14:53] he's really righteous now. I mean, he's
[1:14:55] he's really a good man now, but you
[1:14:57] know, I'm still down here. I'm trying to
[1:14:59] do better. I'm I'm trying to get
[1:15:00] better." And we we know that the bride
[1:15:02] of Jesus Christ is is is a righteous,
[1:15:04] pure, spotless, perfect bride. And and
[1:15:06] so we're like, well, if I could just get
[1:15:09] good enough, maybe I could attain unto
[1:15:11] to that position of the perfect bride.
[1:15:13] And and we're trying to build up to
[1:15:14] that. But you know, the reality of it is
[1:15:17] this. The prophet of God said
[1:15:20] that the angels look dirty in his sight.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; The angels are dirty. We are filthy and
[1:15:31] he's righteous. How are you ever going
[1:15:33] to get to where that classification of
[1:15:35] righteous? How are you ever going to do
[1:15:37] it? How are you ever going to have
[1:15:39] enough good works? How are you ever
[1:15:40] going to have enough good abilities and
[1:15:42] things to offer him so that you say,
[1:15:44] "Well, now I'm righteous." Oh, no,
[1:15:46] friends, it's not going to happen.
[1:15:48] You're never going to get to that place
[1:15:49] where you're finally so good that you
[1:15:52] have become righteous. No, you've got it
[1:15:54] backwards. But we, you know, we have
[1:15:56] this mentality. We actually have a
[1:15:57] complex in our minds because we know the
[1:15:59] bride is perfect. We know she's the
[1:16:01] pure, spotless, virtuous bride. We know
[1:16:04] that by prophecy, but then the devil
[1:16:06] tries to get us to manufacture that by
[1:16:09] our own human ability. You will never
[1:16:11] fulfill it. You'll never become
[1:16:13] righteous by your ability. You know
[1:16:15] what? Your good works, the very best you
[1:16:18] can produce is filthy rags.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; The best of your righteousness is filthy
[1:16:24] rags. So if that's all you can produce
[1:16:26] is filthiness, you could never even make
[1:16:28] it to dirty friends. And there's
[1:16:30] impossible for you to ever be righteous.
[1:16:32] But there was one who came. Hallelujah.
[1:16:36] And he became sin. He became filthy that
[1:16:39] he might give you the very righteousness
[1:16:41] of God.
[1:16:44] Oh, there is nothing you can do to make
[1:16:47] yourself righteous, but you can receive
[1:16:50] the very righteousness of God. So that
[1:16:53] you compared to an angel and the angel
[1:16:56] would look dirty in the sight of God.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; An angel that never sinned, never had a
[1:17:03] bad thought, never one thing, but that
[1:17:06] angel does not have the righteousness of
[1:17:08] God. But this bride of Jesus Christ
[1:17:11] through the blood of Christ has come
[1:17:13] under that sacrifice and she is perfect.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's grace.
[1:17:21] That's grace.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Get your eyes off of your ability, off
[1:17:25] of your works, off of what you can
[1:17:27] manufacture, cuz the best you can
[1:17:29] manufacture is filthy.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you can just catch that
[1:17:36] revelation that it's God's grace alone
[1:17:39] that washes you and takes you into the
[1:17:42] holiness and the righteousness and the
[1:17:44] goodness of God. And and don't get this,
[1:17:47] people get this backwards. They think
[1:17:49] that good works produce righteousness.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; That's a lie.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Good works does not produce
[1:17:55] righteousness. Good works produces
[1:17:58] filthy rags.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; But righteousness produces good works.
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you can get the righteousness of
[1:18:05] God on your life, it will produce good
[1:18:08] works. But if you try to produce good
[1:18:10] works, all you'll get is filthy rags.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's time we laid aside our
[1:18:16] abilities. It's time we laid aside our
[1:18:18] good works, our efforts, our oh, I'm
[1:18:20] going to do this. No, lay that aside and
[1:18:23] let him come down. Let him come down and
[1:18:25] fulfill through you the prophecy of the
[1:18:28] hour. Let his righteousness be expressed
[1:18:30] in you because all you got is filthy
[1:18:33] rags.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about grace this morning.
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a grace that's beyond
[1:18:39] any other grace. I'm talking about a a
[1:18:41] rapturing grace, a grace like we've
[1:18:44] never imagined before.
[1:18:46] Oh, you know Jesus Christ when he was on
[1:18:49] earth, he walked with the disciples. He
[1:18:51] went fishing with them. You know, maybe
[1:18:53] they went hunting together. Uh they they
[1:18:55] had good time. They they enjoyed their
[1:18:56] their time together. And Jesus was a
[1:18:59] man. 100%
[1:19:01] man.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; But you know,
[1:19:06] the disciples walked with him for for
[1:19:09] years. And one day he asked, "Who do you
[1:19:12] say that I am?" And Peter said, "You are
[1:19:17] the son of God.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; You are the the Christ." And Jesus said,
[1:19:22] "Flesh and blood never revealed this to
[1:19:24] you."
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God picks it up and
[1:19:26] he says this and Christ mystery of God
[1:19:28] revealed. He said, "Peter had seen him
[1:19:30] in flesh but didn't know him by flesh."
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus said, "So flesh and blood
[1:19:36] didn't reveal it to you. Even my own
[1:19:39] life didn't reveal it to you.
[1:19:45] And you expect to look in the mirror
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; and see it by your fleshly eyes.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; You expect to look in the mirror and
[1:19:52] say, "Yeah, that's that pure perfect
[1:19:54] bride. Yeah, that's that." Yeah. No. No.
[1:19:57] Your flesh and blood will never reveal
[1:19:59] it to you. It has to be a divine
[1:20:02] revelation. And when you catch that,
[1:20:04] when God reveals to you, you are my
[1:20:07] pearl virtuous bride. You are the one
[1:20:09] I'm longing for. Not your fleshly eyes.
[1:20:11] Flesh and blood will never reveal it,
[1:20:13] but my father in heaven will reveal it
[1:20:15] to you. And when you catch that
[1:20:17] revelation, the gates of hell won't
[1:20:19] prevail against it.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't look at your flesh. Don't look
[1:20:24] at your ability. It will never reveal
[1:20:27] the promise for this hour.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; It's by revelation alone.
[1:20:33] Prophet of God says, "Are you and you
[1:20:35] are wearing the wedding band of
[1:20:38] predestinated unmmerited grace, a
[1:20:41] wedding band of grace, unmmerited of
[1:20:43] your own." God did it himself and he
[1:20:46] knew you before the foundation of the
[1:20:48] world. So he slipped the wedding band on
[1:20:50] you there. Put your name on a book.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; So what did you do to earn being the
[1:20:59] bride of Jesus Christ? Before you were
[1:21:02] ever here,
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; he took his wedding band
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; and he slipped it on your finger,
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; predestinated, unmmerited of your own.
[1:21:13] God did it himself.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, what a thanksgiving."
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, if you can just realize that it's
[1:21:23] not your ability that puts you in the
[1:21:25] bride of Jesus Christ. It's his
[1:21:28] choosing, his election, his call on your
[1:21:30] life. It's his prophecy for this hour,
[1:21:33] not your ability.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Whenever you can get a whenever you get
[1:21:37] away from grace and you start leaning on
[1:21:39] that fleshy arm of of your own ability,
[1:21:42] you know, you're limited
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; because you're just as big as as you
[1:21:46] are. But when you're leaning on the arm
[1:21:47] of Almighty God, when you're trusting in
[1:21:49] him, well, then it's just as big as he
[1:21:51] is.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; And uh it
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; that's a big difference.
[1:21:56] my my brother-in-law, he uh Nathan Eritt
[1:21:59] up in up in Ohio there, he started a
[1:22:01] little coffee shop and and so him and me
[1:22:03] lots of times we get our heads together
[1:22:05] and we're like, well, what could we do
[1:22:06] to make this coffee shop, you know,
[1:22:08] work? Because, you know, contrary to a
[1:22:10] lot of people's opinion, businesses are
[1:22:11] a lot of work. And he's trying to figure
[1:22:14] out how do we make money doing this?
[1:22:15] Because, you know, it takes time for for
[1:22:17] a business to become successful. And
[1:22:19] we're like, well, maybe we could do a
[1:22:20] little bit of this. And okay, that
[1:22:22] worked a little bit. Maybe we could do a
[1:22:23] little bit of this. trying a lot of
[1:22:24] different ideas trying to you know make
[1:22:26] this a successful business and but you
[1:22:28] know last week he was sitting in his
[1:22:31] office and he read a quote and the
[1:22:35] prophet of God was talking about how the
[1:22:37] Holy Ghost himself would come down and
[1:22:39] and that's why people believe in
[1:22:41] miracles that's why the miraculous takes
[1:22:43] place and he says and the reason you
[1:22:45] believe God we believe in miracles and
[1:22:47] signs and wonders is because you are
[1:22:49] sons and daughters of God
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; he says well you I'm a son of God and
[1:22:54] that means I should be believing for
[1:22:56] miracles.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; And and he just stopped and he he really
[1:22:59] searched his heart and he realized that
[1:23:02] he he didn't want God to do a miracle
[1:23:04] for his business because he thought he
[1:23:08] could do it.
[1:23:10] He thought that he could handle it.
[1:23:12] That, you know, surely I'm smart enough
[1:23:14] to to run a little coffee shop. Surely
[1:23:16] I'm smart enough and I I can solve these
[1:23:18] problems. And he just said,
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; he said, "No, no." And he just he just
[1:23:23] repented right there. He says, "God,
[1:23:24] that's the wrong mentality." He says,
[1:23:26] "God, I want you to do a miracle. I want
[1:23:29] to welcome you into my coffee shop. I
[1:23:32] want to see you do the miraculous in my
[1:23:34] business because I'm not smart enough.
[1:23:37] I'm not good enough. I'm not big enough.
[1:23:39] I need you."
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; That afternoon, his sales went off the
[1:23:45] chart.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; The next day, it was a record-breaking
[1:23:50] day. The end of the week came. He said,
[1:23:53] "Zachary, I've never had a week like
[1:23:55] this." He says, "This is better than our
[1:23:56] grand opening." He says, "The numbers
[1:23:58] are completely off the chart."
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; When you welcome God into your
[1:24:05] situation, when you say, "God, I'm not
[1:24:08] big enough. I can't do this by myself. I
[1:24:11] want you to come down." It re unleashes
[1:24:14] omnipotence into your midst.
[1:24:17] Oh friends,
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; perfect strength by perfect weakness. If
[1:24:22] you think you got this, then you'll only
[1:24:25] have the strength of man. But if you
[1:24:27] say, "God, I need you." If you'll hold
[1:24:29] up your hand and say, "Lord, I need you
[1:24:32] in my boat. I need you on the scene for
[1:24:34] my situation." He will come down. He's
[1:24:37] waiting for somebody to call him out of
[1:24:39] history.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You know the prophet of
[1:24:43] God said about Jesus sleeping in the
[1:24:45] boat there. He says it and go awaken
[1:24:47] Jesus. He said you know the storm was
[1:24:49] rocking and raging. He says and you know
[1:24:52] I doubt very much he was asleep.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; So why wasn't he calming the storm? Why
[1:25:01] wasn't he speaking peace? Why wasn't he
[1:25:04] helping them out?
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; They had
[1:25:09] they were trying to row that boat on
[1:25:10] their own. They were trying to bail that
[1:25:12] boat on their own. They were trying to
[1:25:13] do it on their own. And they'd never
[1:25:15] called him on the scene. But friends, my
[1:25:18] God's not dead. And my God isn't asleep.
[1:25:21] He's just waiting for somebody to
[1:25:23] release him on the scene. He's waiting
[1:25:25] for somebody to recognize his presence
[1:25:27] so that his power can be unleashed.
[1:25:30] When they recognized that he was in the
[1:25:33] boat, when he recognized it was their
[1:25:36] opportunity, they called him on the
[1:25:38] scene and they seen the miraculous take
[1:25:40] place.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; So, what about you?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Do you got this? You got this on your
[1:25:48] own. You got these situations figured
[1:25:50] out. You got it all taken care of on
[1:25:52] your own. Or do you have me to something
[1:25:54] this morning?
[1:25:56] Do you have need of something a little
[1:25:58] bigger than you, a little smarter than
[1:26:00] you, a little greater than you? Do you
[1:26:02] have need of Almighty God? Cuz if you
[1:26:04] have need of him, he's looking for
[1:26:06] somewhere where he can pour out himself
[1:26:08] and meet that need.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; You know, the devil, he hates to he
[1:26:14] hates to be exposed. And the word of God
[1:26:16] exposes him. It exposes his tactics. It
[1:26:18] exposes who he is. It exposes what he
[1:26:20] does. But the devil hates it. Prophet
[1:26:23] dog talks about it how how the people
[1:26:25] would come up in the prayer lines or in
[1:26:26] the discernment and and how when that
[1:26:28] devil realized he was being exposed and
[1:26:30] how how he would start to scream out
[1:26:32] asking for help and the the expression
[1:26:34] on the people, you know, he would talk
[1:26:36] about that. And I want you to realize
[1:26:38] this morning that the devil is trying to
[1:26:40] hide.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; The devil is trying to hide in your
[1:26:44] life, in your situations because he
[1:26:47] doesn't want to be exposed. And so, uh,
[1:26:50] uh, uh, for example, I have a this
[1:26:53] morning I have an ankle that's kind of a
[1:26:55] little bit weak and I sprained it up
[1:26:57] back a couple of weeks ago. And so I've
[1:26:58] been wearing an ankle brace and I've
[1:26:59] just been going along and I've been
[1:27:01] saying, "Well, this is normal." You
[1:27:03] know, this is normal.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you what normal is. When I'm
[1:27:08] over in heaven and I'm dancing around
[1:27:10] the throne of God, I ain't going to have
[1:27:11] any weak angles. I'm not going to have
[1:27:13] that. That is what my normal is, not
[1:27:16] what this earth brings upon me. And so
[1:27:18] if Satan comes and he brings something
[1:27:20] that's normal, I say, "But is it
[1:27:22] according to God's word? Is it according
[1:27:24] to what God says about this situation?"
[1:27:27] Because if it's not what God says, I
[1:27:29] don't want it.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; I don't want normal Leodysia. I want
[1:27:33] normal heavenly places. That's what I
[1:27:36] want.
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; I want to accept what God promised for
[1:27:39] me right now.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; So here's a simple example. um here
[1:27:45] among us right now. How many people here
[1:27:47] have have a sickness or an infirmity in
[1:27:49] their body? Something that the devil put
[1:27:51] there?
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Just just hold your hands up. Hold your
[1:27:54] hands up. Look up. Look around. I want
[1:27:55] you to look around. I want you to
[1:27:56] realize that the devil is attacking the
[1:27:59] bride of Jesus Christ. He's on a
[1:28:01] rampage. He's attacking. He's
[1:28:03] tormenting. That's what he is. He's a
[1:28:04] tormentor.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; But what does God say?
[1:28:12] You know, I the in this day, Brother
[1:28:14] Brand says it's a nervous, neurotic age
[1:28:16] in which it seems we're unfit to live.
[1:28:17] He says, "If time would go along a
[1:28:19] little bit far, there'd be total
[1:28:20] insanity." And so, we we were in an age
[1:28:22] when the the mind is being tormented and
[1:28:25] and Satan's coming in every which
[1:28:26] direction. And so, this morning, I'm
[1:28:29] asking you, how many here have to fight
[1:28:32] with nervousness? Just hold up your
[1:28:33] hand.
[1:28:35] How many here have to have to fight with
[1:28:37] those nervous battles that that anxiety,
[1:28:40] the the nervousness, the the fear, the
[1:28:42] the the darkness, the depression, the
[1:28:43] discouragement. It's all over.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; But you know, he tries to hide,
[1:28:51] &gt;&gt; but you just exposed him.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; And you know what? He didn't like that.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to recognize it's not
[1:28:58] hard. It's not complicated. I want you
[1:29:00] to recognize what God said
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; about sickness, about nervousness, about
[1:29:05] anxiety.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; It says he was wounded for our
[1:29:08] transgressions.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; He was bruised for our iniquities. The
[1:29:13] chastisement of our peace
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; was upon him
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; and with his stripes we are healed.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; One sacrifice settled the sin question.
[1:29:24] It settled the healing of the body, the
[1:29:26] spirit and the soul. It was one
[1:29:28] sacrifice forever that took care of your
[1:29:31] situation. So I don't care what
[1:29:33] nervousness you're dealing with, what if
[1:29:35] it's cancer or whether it's a toothache.
[1:29:36] I don't care what it is. My God is the
[1:29:39] one that is the healer of all your
[1:29:41] diseases. He's the one that forgives all
[1:29:42] your iniquities. One sacrifice settled
[1:29:45] the question.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Do you lo? And so I I ask you this this
[1:29:51] morning, do you believe that you can be
[1:29:54] healed?
[1:29:56] Do you believe that?
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; You believe that you can be healed
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; body, spirit, and soul.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; You know, I you can be set free from
[1:30:10] nervousness, fear, anxiety,
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; because you see, fear,
[1:30:15] it didn't come from God.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; He didn't send you a spirit of fear.
[1:30:19] That wasn't him. He gives a a spirit of
[1:30:22] love and of peace and of a sound mind.
[1:30:24] It's a different person bringing that
[1:30:26] fear into your life. And so if it's not
[1:30:29] from God, you don't have to keep it.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; And you know, back several years ago in
[1:30:36] 2023, December 31st, 2023, I sitting in
[1:30:41] church service, Brother Andrew Glover
[1:30:43] was preaching on overcoming fear. And I
[1:30:45] said, "My nature is such that I'm not a
[1:30:48] very fearful person, which helps me
[1:30:50] sometimes and gets me into trouble other
[1:30:52] times, but I just I'm not a fearful
[1:30:54] person." And so I was trying not to
[1:30:56] pitchfork the whole sermon on to my
[1:30:58] neighbors, you know, like, "Oh, that's
[1:30:59] good for the person over there and
[1:31:00] that's good for the person over there."
[1:31:02] Because, you know, that's not what
[1:31:03] you're supposed to be doing in church.
[1:31:04] In church, you're saying, "Lord, talk to
[1:31:06] me. I want something for me. I'm not
[1:31:07] asking about, you know, how I can apply
[1:31:09] this to my neighbor. I want it for me."
[1:31:11] And so I'm like, "Lord, where am I
[1:31:13] fearful?" because I don't see it. I
[1:31:15] don't see that that fear in me. And and
[1:31:18] he just answered me very clearly. He
[1:31:21] said, "You're afraid to claim your
[1:31:23] healing." Now,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; you see, because ever since I was a
[1:31:29] young boy, for for 30 years, I've had
[1:31:31] migraine headaches and just, you know,
[1:31:33] you curl up in a ball and you're
[1:31:34] vomiting and you're you're just it it's
[1:31:36] it's horrible. And and I I've had these
[1:31:38] migraine headaches and and I said, you
[1:31:40] know, I'd asked the Lord 10 years ago. I
[1:31:43] I I said, "Lord, I want to know. Did you
[1:31:46] put this in my life? Did you put this
[1:31:48] here or can I be healed?"
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; And so, I went to a meeting and I said,
[1:31:52] "Lord, I'm here for to answer to my
[1:31:54] question. I want to know, can I be
[1:31:56] healed of this?" And the Lord in his
[1:31:58] goodness, he gave me a very clear-cut
[1:32:00] answer. He said, "I didn't put that
[1:32:01] there. You can be healed." And I was so
[1:32:04] excited. I said, "Oh, praise God,
[1:32:06] Hannah. I'm telling you, I can be healed
[1:32:08] of this. God told me I can be healed of
[1:32:10] this." And I was so excited.
[1:32:14] And 10 years later, I still had those
[1:32:17] migraine headaches.
[1:32:19] And somewhere in my thinking,
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; the devil had slipped one up on me. And
[1:32:27] he got it to where I was thinking
[1:32:29] someday when I was good enough, someday
[1:32:32] when I'd done something that just made
[1:32:34] heaven smile, maybe I'd preached a good
[1:32:35] enough sermon, maybe I'd won enough
[1:32:37] souls to the Lord, he would be so happy
[1:32:39] with me that he would heal me.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; That's a lie.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; And I I said that that's not right. I
[1:32:48] said, I can't earn my healing. I can't
[1:32:50] do anything to merit my healing. The
[1:32:52] only thing I can do is accept my
[1:32:54] healing. And I said, "Then Lord, this
[1:32:56] night right now, December 31st, 2023, is
[1:33:00] the night I accept my healing from
[1:33:02] migraine headaches." And I began to
[1:33:05] stand on that. I began to testify of
[1:33:07] that. I began to confess that because I
[1:33:10] knew that he had given me a promise that
[1:33:13] not only I could be healed, but that
[1:33:15] he'd already healed me.
[1:33:20] It it it took several months went by and
[1:33:24] I'm still standing there. I'd be curled
[1:33:26] up over a trash can vomiting up and my
[1:33:28] head just a pounding and just standing
[1:33:30] there saying, "Lord, thank you for
[1:33:32] healing me. Thank you for healing me. I
[1:33:34] don't care how I feel. I don't care what
[1:33:36] the symptom is. That means nothing. Your
[1:33:39] word said I'm healed. I don't care what
[1:33:41] I feel. I don't care what I see. Your
[1:33:43] promise is eternal and it is true." And
[1:33:46] this is the lie.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; And so I stood on that for four months
[1:33:50] until we went up to brother Shawn
[1:33:52] Martin's camp meeting up there. And I
[1:33:54] was there going up to help with the
[1:33:56] prayer line with a pounding migraine. I
[1:33:57] said, I'm going to have to carry
[1:33:58] somebody out of the tent and go vomit
[1:34:00] behind the tent somewhere and then
[1:34:01] stagger back there. But I says, you know
[1:34:03] what? I believe I'm healed. I've
[1:34:05] confessed I'm healed. I'm going to act
[1:34:06] like I'm healed. And as I walked up to
[1:34:09] that prayer line, that migraine headache
[1:34:11] vanished and my body was completely
[1:34:13] healed.
[1:34:17] Oh,
[1:34:19] when you're not looking at how good you
[1:34:21] are or you're going to earn something,
[1:34:24] you just say, "I accept it." Not some
[1:34:26] other day. Not some other time. This
[1:34:28] day, I accept it right now. I'm standing
[1:34:31] on that. I'm a faith seed of Abraham. He
[1:34:34] made the promise and I am a believer.
[1:34:36] And this day is the day that I possess
[1:34:39] my mountain.
[1:34:41] If you're waiting to get good enough,
[1:34:43] you'll have a mighty long wait. But if
[1:34:45] you're looking if he's good enough,
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; if you're looking if he made the
[1:34:49] promise, if you're looking at what he
[1:34:51] said, then you can have it this day
[1:34:53] because he is worthy.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram tells a story of his friend
[1:34:59] Papa Cox.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; Papa Cox was a chain smoker of
[1:35:03] cigarettes, just smoking and smoking and
[1:35:05] smoking. And he was a friend of brother
[1:35:07] Brams. He says, "Well, Papa, why don't
[1:35:09] you give your heart to the Lord? Why
[1:35:10] don't you become a Christian? He says,
[1:35:11] "You you you love the Lord. You believe
[1:35:13] in him." He says, "Oh, yes." He says,
[1:35:14] "But these cigarettes, Brother Brandon,
[1:35:16] if I could just stop these cigarettes."
[1:35:18] And he said, he says, "Well, Papa, you
[1:35:22] don't be why why don't you become a
[1:35:24] Christian?" And he said, "Well, I can't
[1:35:25] be I would become a Christian when I can
[1:35:27] get good enough."
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I tell you what you
[1:35:32] do, Papa. You look around till you find
[1:35:34] a place where you can get good enough.
[1:35:36] Then tell me where that place is cuz I
[1:35:38] want to go too.
[1:35:40] He said Christ never came to save good
[1:35:42] men.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; He came to save sinners that knew they
[1:35:46] were sinners that knew they needed a God
[1:35:48] to redeem them from their fallen
[1:35:50] condition. Not people who said, "I'm
[1:35:52] good enough." That's not who he came
[1:35:54] for. If you think you're good enough, if
[1:35:56] you think you don't you don't need a
[1:35:58] savior, then he's not there for you. But
[1:36:00] if you say, "God, I can't do it. I'm not
[1:36:02] big enough. I'm not worthy. I need a
[1:36:05] savior." Then that's the one he came
[1:36:06] for.
[1:36:08] He came to save sinners that knowed they
[1:36:11] were sinners.
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; And he he began talking about them and
[1:36:14] he said, "Oh, these cigarettes." He
[1:36:15] says, "I'm not talking about these
[1:36:16] cigarettes." He says, "M" He says,
[1:36:18] "Papa, listen." He says, "I'm not a
[1:36:20] legalist. I don't care about them
[1:36:21] cigarettes." He says, "I believe in
[1:36:23] grace. Just forget about it." He says,
[1:36:25] "I want to ask you one question. Do you
[1:36:28] believe Jesus Christ came to save
[1:36:30] sinners? Do you believe he came to
[1:36:32] redeem man? Do you believe that God came
[1:36:35] down and crossed his train with man? And
[1:36:37] do you expect accept it on that basis
[1:36:39] that that he's worthy? He says, "What
[1:36:42] about him?"
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, brother Brandon, he's
[1:36:46] worthy."
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; I said, "Then accept what he gives you."
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm asking you this morning. You
[1:36:55] want to be set free. You want to be
[1:36:56] delivered. You want to be healed. I'm
[1:36:58] not asking you how good you are. Is he
[1:37:01] worthy? What's your confession? If he's
[1:37:04] worthy, then accept it what he offers
[1:37:07] you.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; Took the man down to the water, baptized
[1:37:12] him in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:14] Christ, which is the only name given
[1:37:16] under heaven whereby you must be saved.
[1:37:18] Baptized him in the name of Jesus
[1:37:19] Christ, and he rose up out of that water
[1:37:21] and he smoked another cigarette.
[1:37:23] Couple weeks went by, I think it was a
[1:37:25] month went by.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; One day he'd had a little injury at the
[1:37:30] and he was laying there in his bed and
[1:37:31] they brought him his package of
[1:37:33] cigarettes. He said, "Get them things
[1:37:35] away from me. I don't want those things.
[1:37:37] I don't desire those things anymore."
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; He'd found a place that could make him
[1:37:42] good. He'd found something that could
[1:37:44] change him from the inside. Not his
[1:37:46] ability. He didn't work it up. He didn't
[1:37:48] manufacture it. But almighty God came
[1:37:50] down through the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:52] and changed his very desires. Changed
[1:37:55] his nature and put the nature of Christ
[1:37:57] in him.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, scripture says that we all as
[1:38:02] unclean, we are all as an unclean thing
[1:38:05] and all our righteousness is are as
[1:38:07] filthy rags.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; And so the best this bride could ever
[1:38:12] produce in righteousness is filthy rags.
[1:38:15] Your good works will never put you in
[1:38:18] the rapture. It won't do it. It's the
[1:38:20] grace of God that will put you in the
[1:38:23] rapture. It is the elective grace of
[1:38:26] God. It's not your good works that put
[1:38:28] you in a rapture. It's his choosing.
[1:38:31] It's his call. It's his righteousness. A
[1:38:34] and your Christian life will never be
[1:38:37] enough in your ability to earn you a
[1:38:40] slot in the rapture.
[1:38:41] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; it's grace. And you say, "Well, you
[1:38:46] know, if it's not if it's not how good I
[1:38:47] am or or Brother Colby, if it's not if
[1:38:49] it's not all your efforts and your
[1:38:51] ability, then what makes you any
[1:38:52] different than anyone else?"
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; Grace,
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; God's favor on your life,
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; his love to choose you as his bride,
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; that's what separates you and sets you
[1:39:08] apart.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; The grace of God.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Prophet God talks about that. He says,
[1:39:13] "You know, that woman takes that
[1:39:14] garment, she lays out the calico, when
[1:39:16] she sets it there, and then she just
[1:39:18] chooses a place
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; to begin to cut. She found a place that
[1:39:22] she just wanted to cut out that garment
[1:39:24] and she laid it there. It's the same
[1:39:26] type of fabric." And she cuts it out and
[1:39:28] she takes this piece and she makes a
[1:39:30] dress out of it. And the other part's
[1:39:32] just a pile of remnants that she sets
[1:39:33] aside. The same fabric, the same
[1:39:36] material, just as good as anything else
[1:39:38] in the pile. But she chooses one part to
[1:39:41] make that dress out of and the other is
[1:39:43] set aside.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God says it's just he
[1:39:47] it's it's it's it's his business where
[1:39:49] he lays out the pattern. It's God's
[1:39:51] business where he lays the pattern. He
[1:39:53] cuts her right out. It's Is that right?
[1:39:55] Now, the rest of this calico here, it's
[1:39:58] just as good a calico as in the dress.
[1:40:00] Is that right?
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; But it's God's election.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; So, what are you?
[1:40:07] Are you a product of your ability and
[1:40:09] your good works?
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; No. You're under the choosing of his
[1:40:13] elective grace on your life.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, that call, it's not an optional
[1:40:20] call, brother Matthew. When he calls,
[1:40:23] they will answer.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, you you see when when we look at
[1:40:28] this this uh rapture in grace, we see
[1:40:31] that it it's something that it's God's
[1:40:34] choosing. It's God's election on your
[1:40:36] life, not anything you can manufacture.
[1:40:39] It's the faith of God. It's not your
[1:40:41] faith. It's not your ability. It's his
[1:40:43] faith. It's not your works. It's his
[1:40:45] works. It's not your righteousness. It's
[1:40:46] his righteousness. It's God from
[1:40:48] beginning to end because you see, man
[1:40:50] will always fail. But God says, "I'm
[1:40:52] going to have a bride. And so, I'm going
[1:40:54] to have to handle the process from start
[1:40:55] to finish. I'm going to have to come
[1:40:57] down and I'm going to have to be in it
[1:40:59] from the day they're at the altar all
[1:41:00] the way to the day they take a rapture.
[1:41:02] It's going to be me manifesting and
[1:41:04] expressing myself through them because
[1:41:05] if I leave it to the arm of flesh, it
[1:41:07] won't work.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; And so he came down and God became flesh
[1:41:13] in a bride in a people, but it's in such
[1:41:16] a humble simple way that flesh and blood
[1:41:18] will never reveal it to you.
[1:41:21] Oh,
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; you look at you look at the the grace of
[1:41:25] God that would come to you and and
[1:41:29] prophet of God says that
[1:41:33] your new life is in the lamb's book of
[1:41:35] life.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; It's your marriage certificate.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; So you say, "Well, who's part of this
[1:41:41] elected bride? Who is the people? Who
[1:41:43] are the ones?"
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Well, it's you've got to have a marriage
[1:41:46] certificate. that if your name's on that
[1:41:49] marriage certificate, it's settled. It's
[1:41:51] over. I It's peace. It's shalom. If your
[1:41:54] name's on that marriage certificate, but
[1:41:55] if your name's not on there, there's
[1:41:56] nothing you can do to put your own name
[1:41:58] on there.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; And so you you say, "Well, how do we
[1:42:02] know? How do we know whose name's on on
[1:42:05] that marriage certificate and who's not?
[1:42:07] What what's it about?" Well, that's the
[1:42:09] beautiful thing about the message of the
[1:42:11] hour.
[1:42:13] He said, "God, put your name your your
[1:42:15] your new life in the lamb's book of
[1:42:17] life, your marriage certificate." So
[1:42:19] that lamb's book of life has the names
[1:42:22] written down of the marriage certificate
[1:42:24] holders. It has the names written down
[1:42:26] of who is a part of this bride of Jesus
[1:42:28] Christ. And you say, "Well, how can we
[1:42:30] look at it? How can we read that? How
[1:42:32] can we find out if my name's on there?"
[1:42:34] Well, it's very simple, friends. God has
[1:42:36] sent us a message in this day that took
[1:42:39] that book and opened it up that we might
[1:42:41] read our name written on that book.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, the only way you can be a part of
[1:42:46] that bride is if your name was put on
[1:42:48] that book, lamb's book of life before
[1:42:50] the foundation of the world. And you
[1:42:52] know what? Before the foundation of the
[1:42:54] world, when the sons of God seen that
[1:42:56] happening, got mighty excited.
[1:43:00] The
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; prophet of God tells us how he says they
[1:43:03] were shouting for joy because they seen
[1:43:05] their names written on that book before
[1:43:07] the foundation of the world.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; And so if they were shouting then
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; and you catch the revelation now,
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; you'll do the same thing.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; That book was sitting in the right hand
[1:43:18] of him that sat on the throne and it was
[1:43:19] a sealed book. Nobody knew if they were
[1:43:22] a part of it. They didn't know. They
[1:43:23] weren't sure. And they were weeping and
[1:43:25] wailing because there was no man that
[1:43:27] was worthy to open that book. But then
[1:43:29] there was a call made for a kinsman
[1:43:31] redeemer. And there came a lamb that
[1:43:33] stepped forward, a lamb that had
[1:43:35] prevailed. And he opened that book and
[1:43:37] he tore off the seals. And the prophet
[1:43:39] of God said he tore off the seals and he
[1:43:41] sent it down to his seventh angel to
[1:43:44] reveal it to his people.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; So according to the message of this
[1:43:49] hour, those names have been that were
[1:43:51] sealed up that were held up that nobody
[1:43:53] knew about. They were opened up and it
[1:43:55] was sent down by the seventh angel to
[1:43:58] reveal it to his people.
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; So that means
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; you can find out.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; And the prophet of God said John must
[1:44:06] have looked past the curtain of time and
[1:44:08] looked in there and seen himself.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, and he had himself a screaming fit
[1:44:13] when he realized that he was a part of
[1:44:15] this. When he recognized that his name
[1:44:18] was on there and there was nothing that
[1:44:20] could take it off. when he recognized
[1:44:22] the security of his position. I'm a part
[1:44:25] of this and there's nothing going to
[1:44:26] stop me. Well, it's time for a jubilee
[1:44:29] time.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; You know, we see that that book come
[1:44:31] down, Revelations 10. I and you know,
[1:44:34] you're familiar with this, but we see
[1:44:35] those seven thunders begin to utter
[1:44:37] their voices when that book was coming
[1:44:39] down open.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; And that's the bride's revival. them
[1:44:43] seven thunders. You see, because when
[1:44:45] that book came open, when those thunders
[1:44:47] declared out, it began to reveal the
[1:44:49] bride of Jesus Christ, it began to
[1:44:52] identify her say who she was. And it's
[1:44:54] something that that is so sublime we
[1:44:57] can't comprehend it. The recognition
[1:44:59] that God would have a people that he
[1:45:02] chose of his election, of his
[1:45:04] predestination before the foundation of
[1:45:06] the world, he says there's going to be a
[1:45:08] bride and Jonathan Martin's a part of
[1:45:10] it. And he put that name right there. He
[1:45:12] says there's going to be a bride. Wendle
[1:45:13] Martin's a part of it. He put those
[1:45:15] names down there. And you know, no
[1:45:17] matter what, you might have been in the
[1:45:19] darkest of darkest pits, you might have
[1:45:21] been there. But that whole time when you
[1:45:23] were in sin, well, you were yet dead in
[1:45:25] sin. Your name was still on that book.
[1:45:27] On your good days, your name's on that
[1:45:29] book. On your bad days, your name's on
[1:45:31] that book. It doesn't change the
[1:45:33] election of God. Amen.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, when you catch that
[1:45:39] revelation, it's a shalom to the bride
[1:45:42] of Jesus Christ.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God, he says in that
[1:45:46] first seal, he says he was commissioned
[1:45:48] to write everything he'd seen. But when
[1:45:50] those seven thunders over in Revelations
[1:45:52] 10 uttered, he said, "Don't write it.
[1:45:54] Don't write it at all." He says, "There
[1:45:56] are mysteries." Now, this is the first
[1:45:58] seal. And the prophet of God says, "Now,
[1:46:00] we don't know what they are yet, but my
[1:46:02] opinion, they'll be revealed right away.
[1:46:05] And when it do, it'll give faith for
[1:46:08] that rapturing grace for the church to
[1:46:11] be moved out.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Faith. Now, I just I want you to pay
[1:46:14] real close attention to the to the form
[1:46:16] of these words. Faith for that rapturing
[1:46:20] grace.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; Now, Prophet of God preaches many times
[1:46:22] about rapturing faith, maybe about 30
[1:46:24] times, about 15 times about about
[1:46:26] rapturing grace. And but I want you to
[1:46:28] realize you have to have a faith for
[1:46:31] this kind of grace. Now, if if if we
[1:46:35] were to look at uh you know, my my uh
[1:46:37] where's where's Shalom at? Right here.
[1:46:39] There she is right there. Shalom, would
[1:46:40] you stand up, please? Now, if if
[1:46:43] someday, you know, a young man were to
[1:46:45] come up to you and he'd begin to talk to
[1:46:48] you,
[1:46:50] he'd say, "My you, you know, your hair
[1:46:53] is just so beautiful and I I just I just
[1:46:56] love to to to to see and look in your
[1:46:58] eyes. You're you're just so beautiful in
[1:47:00] my sight." And you know, I I I just
[1:47:02] really I want to I want I I want to
[1:47:05] marry you. You know, I just love you so
[1:47:07] much. Now,
[1:47:10] you got to have some questions here. You
[1:47:11] know, well, you got a lot of questions,
[1:47:13] but we'll just deal with one of them
[1:47:14] right now. And that is,
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; do you believe him?
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that he actually likes
[1:47:25] you? Come on.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that his favor has
[1:47:31] actually fallen on you?
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; You see, if you don't have a faith
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; in his choosing, his grace on your life,
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; you you'd just turn around, walk away.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; You'd say, "Oh, no. No, it couldn't be
[1:47:47] me because, you know, my hair is not
[1:47:50] straight like the other girls. is curly
[1:47:51] and you know and I don't have black hair
[1:47:53] and it it's blonde and oh I
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; but if you believe what he's saying
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; if you actually believe that Wesley
[1:48:10] Martin has found favor in the sight of
[1:48:12] God
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; if you can have that faith in his grace
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; preacher Beautiful.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; You know, not just a grace that will
[1:48:23] will put up with you a little bit.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about a grace that was so
[1:48:28] great. A favor that was so strong that
[1:48:31] he came down and he gave his life for a
[1:48:34] purpose to redeem a bride to himself.
[1:48:37] The favor of God, the grace of God, the
[1:48:39] love of God so powerful that he
[1:48:41] condescended from the throne of heaven
[1:48:44] and came down and was made flesh that he
[1:48:46] might call you to himself.
[1:48:54] faith
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; for grace.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; I ask you this morning, was he talking
[1:49:00] about you?
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, is there something inside of you
[1:49:04] that says, "I know I'm not good enough.
[1:49:06] I know I'm not worthy enough, but God, I
[1:49:08] I just I just believe you were talking
[1:49:10] to me. I There's something in me that
[1:49:12] gives me a faith that your grace is upon
[1:49:14] my life. There's something in me that I
[1:49:16] just believe, Lord, that you were
[1:49:18] talking about me, that I'm identified
[1:49:20] and a part of this. You see, when those
[1:49:22] seals begin to come open and it begins
[1:49:24] to identify you, it'll give you a faith
[1:49:27] for that rapturing grace.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Because it'll identify
[1:49:34] you. It'll let you know who you are. Oh,
[1:49:39] prophet of God goes through showing how
[1:49:40] that that that third pole that that
[1:49:43] climax of his ministry and how it would
[1:49:45] come to that great point and he says we
[1:49:47] know it's been identified and it's it's
[1:49:48] here. It's among us and and he says that
[1:49:51] this will be the thing to my opinion. He
[1:49:53] says I don't say the Lord tells me this.
[1:49:55] He said it was his opinion. Well, it's
[1:49:56] mine too. It's my opinion just as well.
[1:50:00] This will be a thing that third poll.
[1:50:03] This will be a thing that will start the
[1:50:05] rapturing faith for the going away.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; And he says, now over here, he says, now
[1:50:11] remember the third pole was the opening
[1:50:13] of them seven seals.
[1:50:16] &gt;&gt; Now I want you just now there's there's
[1:50:18] the seals have so much in them, but I
[1:50:20] just want to look at one little facet of
[1:50:21] this faith for grace, rapturing faith,
[1:50:24] how it's unleashing a bride's revival,
[1:50:26] how it's doing all this that opening of
[1:50:28] the word. And I just want to look at one
[1:50:29] little part of that and that's when that
[1:50:31] book come open,
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; John seen his identity.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; And when he seen his identity, the
[1:50:39] prophet of God, he said he must have
[1:50:40] looked in and seen his name wrote there
[1:50:43] when them seals broke. Another place he
[1:50:45] says he says how he looked in he seen
[1:50:48] himself beyond the curtain of time. Now,
[1:50:50] I want you to realize if you could catch
[1:50:52] a vision of the eternities of God, and
[1:50:55] you could see all the angels gathered
[1:50:57] around the throne, and you could see all
[1:50:58] the redeemed gathered around the throne
[1:51:00] in the eternities after everything
[1:51:02] settled, after everything's cleared, and
[1:51:04] you could look beyond that curtain of
[1:51:06] time, and you could see yourself
[1:51:08] shouting and dancing and praising God
[1:51:10] around that throne. Well, it takes all
[1:51:12] the worry away. It takes all the fear
[1:51:14] away cuz you already made it. You
[1:51:16] already know the end of the story.
[1:51:18] You've seen the final conclusion to the
[1:51:20] question. It's not a question of could I
[1:51:23] make it. It's the question of how could
[1:51:25] you not make it.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, John had a a revival. He
[1:51:30] John stepped into the bride's revival
[1:51:32] when the book came open and he seen his
[1:51:35] identification
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; because you see this message, this third
[1:51:39] pole ministry, it breaks through the
[1:51:41] amnesia. It breaks through that and it
[1:51:43] begins to identify a people and it
[1:51:46] begins to tell you who you were from
[1:51:48] before the foundation of the world when
[1:51:50] all the sons of God were shouting for
[1:51:52] joy. It begins to identify you and tell
[1:51:54] you you were a part of him from the
[1:51:56] beginning. You were a part of him in his
[1:51:58] mind when he was on the cross. You were
[1:52:00] in his mind. He did it for you. It's
[1:52:03] been about you all the way from the
[1:52:04] beginning because it's a love story that
[1:52:07] he's expressing.
[1:52:09] Oh, it's the grace of God, the favor of
[1:52:11] God. This message breaks that amnesia
[1:52:14] and it begins to identify a people. You
[1:52:17] say, "Well, what kind of identification
[1:52:20] are we talking about? How do we how do
[1:52:21] we know if it's if it's my name that's
[1:52:24] calling?"
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; Well,
[1:52:28] you know, we could
[1:52:31] know that eagle,
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; there was a scream that went out. There
[1:52:36] was a voice that cried out,
[1:52:38] Other people ran, other people hid,
[1:52:41] other people left. But there was
[1:52:43] something inside of him. He didn't
[1:52:45] manufacture it. He didn't put it there.
[1:52:47] But from the beginning, he was an eagle.
[1:52:49] And that voice inside of him cried out
[1:52:51] and said, "I recognize that voice. I
[1:52:54] identify with that voice. That's calling
[1:52:56] my name. It's identifying that I was a
[1:52:59] son of God before the foundations of the
[1:53:01] world. It's identifying who I am." And
[1:53:04] it began to respond to that call. Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, prophet of God says, "Now, what are
[1:53:10] we going to do when all we get that
[1:53:12] group together where the revelation is
[1:53:14] perfectly in harmony and God expressing
[1:53:16] it through his word by the same actions,
[1:53:19] the same things that he did, making the
[1:53:21] word manifest."
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; Oh, he says, "If the church only knew
[1:53:27] its position, it will one day."
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; What day are we talking about?
[1:53:35] This day, this scripture is fulfilled.
[1:53:37] We're not wondering if we're some little
[1:53:39] Pentecostal chicken. We have been
[1:53:41] identified. We know our position in the
[1:53:44] word. We know our position under the
[1:53:46] message of the hour. And we're standing
[1:53:48] in that position. We've got our seat. We
[1:53:50] got our ticket. We've got our token.
[1:53:52] We're just awaiting for that power to
[1:53:54] raise us to the skies.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; And I say, you know, like they say on
[1:53:58] the plane, everybody get in your seat
[1:54:01] cuz the rest of us are ready to fly.
[1:54:05] Oh, he says that church will know its
[1:54:07] position one day. He says they then the
[1:54:10] rapture will go when it knows what it
[1:54:13] is.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, did the message of the hour call
[1:54:17] your name?
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Did it identify you personally?
[1:54:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, the prophet of God, he says this,
[1:54:24] after you've recognized the very word of
[1:54:26] God was eagle food, then you left the
[1:54:29] other thing. You have been formed into
[1:54:31] the living image of the living God. You
[1:54:33] heard from your theophony and if this
[1:54:36] earthly body be dissolved, we have one
[1:54:38] waiting. I've already heard from my
[1:54:41] eternal body across the the the
[1:54:44] dimension of time. I have heard from my
[1:54:46] theophony. You say, "What are you
[1:54:47] talking about?" I'm talking about the
[1:54:49] message of the hour.
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about something that I heard
[1:54:52] and it resonated on the inside of me and
[1:54:54] I just looked at it and I said, "Mama,
[1:54:57] that's me."
[1:54:58] Oh, the prophet of God says just like
[1:55:01] that little eagle when he heard the
[1:55:03] bridegroom's voice.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; You see that eagle scream, that message
[1:55:09] of the hour, it was not the voice of a
[1:55:11] man. It was not the voice of a Kentucky
[1:55:13] hillbilly. It was the voice of the
[1:55:15] bridegroom speaking to you. And he says
[1:55:17] when he heard the bridegroom's voice, he
[1:55:19] went to it, the anointed, vindicated
[1:55:22] word of God for the last day.
[1:55:25] Oh, and this message has identified you
[1:55:27] not as a a denominational chicken food
[1:55:30] feeder, but it's identified you not as a
[1:55:32] church, but as the bride of Jesus
[1:55:34] Christ.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; it's a glorious thing to recognize and
[1:55:39] submit to the identification that God
[1:55:42] has placed on you in this hour as the
[1:55:44] pure, virtuous, sinless bride of the son
[1:55:47] of the living God.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; You never did it in the first place.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; No. How can you be a sinner and a
[1:55:54] redeemed at the same time?
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; How could you do it? How could you be?
[1:55:58] Prophet of God says, "How can you be in
[1:56:00] the pawn shop and out of the pawn shop
[1:56:01] at the same time?"
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; How can it be? He says, "How can you be
[1:56:05] a sinner and a saint?"
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh, he has redeemed us by his
[1:56:11] blood." How can you be a sinner and
[1:56:13] redeemed at the same time? No. You see,
[1:56:15] a s a child of God, he says, "Those that
[1:56:18] are born of God cannot sin.
[1:56:24] Oh, he says he says here another place.
[1:56:28] He says there's not a man, no angel, no
[1:56:30] nothing, not even God himself
[1:56:34] can forgive you for your sins. It's
[1:56:37] already done.
[1:56:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus did it at the cross. But it'll
[1:56:47] never prosper you anything or profit you
[1:56:49] anything until you accept it.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Romans 4:6 says, "Even as David also
[1:56:55] described the blessedness of the man
[1:56:57] unto whom God imputth righteousness
[1:57:00] without works,
[1:57:02] &gt;&gt; saying, "Blessed are those are they
[1:57:05] whose iniquities are forgiven and whose
[1:57:07] sins are covered. Blessed is the man to
[1:57:10] whom the Lord will not impute sin."
[1:57:14] Oh my.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's grace.
[1:57:16] &gt;&gt; That's the grace of God that's on this
[1:57:18] bride of Jesus Christ. I don't care how
[1:57:20] many times she might fall on her face. I
[1:57:22] don't care how many times she might feel
[1:57:24] like she didn't do it right and she
[1:57:26] messed it up. God don't even put it on
[1:57:28] the record. He does not impute sin to
[1:57:30] this bride cuz she has come underneath
[1:57:33] his grace.
[1:57:34] [Music]
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, that rapturing grace that's been
[1:57:38] unleashed in this hour. You know, you
[1:57:40] look at the parallel. You look at
[1:57:42] Abraham and Sarah and how they received
[1:57:44] that visitation of the son of man which
[1:57:47] came to them and began to discern the
[1:57:48] thoughts and intents of their heart
[1:57:50] which we have seen in our day. We have
[1:57:52] seen that same visitation of the son of
[1:57:54] man and he called by name Abraham.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Called him by name knew his name. Knew
[1:58:00] he had a new identity. Abraham Sarah. He
[1:58:04] called them. He identified them. And he
[1:58:06] began to speak that the promise
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; that had been sitting there for years
[1:58:10] and years and years, he began to say,
[1:58:13] "This is the hour. This is the time.
[1:58:15] This is the day for the fulfillment of
[1:58:17] the prophecy."
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; And you know what, Sarah, she'd woke up
[1:58:21] on the wrong side of the bed that day.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; The prophet of God says she was all
[1:58:25] fussy and and she was in a bad attitude
[1:58:27] and and she was going on and and
[1:58:29] causing, you know, stirring the pot at
[1:58:31] the house there.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Kind of fussy that morning.
[1:58:36] The prophet of God said it was the devil
[1:58:38] trying to block the visitation that was
[1:58:40] already on the road.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Oh friends, you know it doesn't matter.
[1:58:45] You say, "Well, I've had a lot of things
[1:58:47] going on. It's been really getting dark.
[1:58:48] It's really been getting hard. There's
[1:58:50] been a lot of struggles lately." That's
[1:58:51] just the devil trying to block the
[1:58:53] visitation that God is coming to your
[1:58:55] place. He's coming your way. Don't you
[1:58:57] get worked up over it. Don't you get
[1:58:59] worried about it. He is coming to your
[1:59:01] situation. He is coming to fulfill the
[1:59:03] promise that he said he would do.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; And there she was all in a bad mood, all
[1:59:08] fussy, all out of sorts. And the angel
[1:59:10] of the Lord comes up and Abraham runs
[1:59:12] out and she's like, "Well, how many
[1:59:13] fanatics is my husband going to
[1:59:14] entertain today?"
[1:59:18] And and he runs, he's like, "Sarah, this
[1:59:20] might be our day of visitation." I I
[1:59:22] really think it is.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; And she said, "You've been saying that
[1:59:26] for years."
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah. We've been talking about a
[1:59:30] rapture. We've been talking about it for
[1:59:32] a long time,
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; but we've received the visitation.
[1:59:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, and you know, she was there and and
[1:59:41] God began to speak and she called God a
[1:59:45] liar to his face.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; And you know what?
[1:59:52] God would have killed her right there.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; She He would have just taken her right
[1:59:57] out of the picture. Come on.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; But he couldn't do it.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, and and the prophet of God says
[2:00:06] because God could not kill Sarah. He ha
[2:00:09] because he'd have to take Abraham and
[2:00:11] Sarah was a part of Abraham. They were
[2:00:13] in a union. And to take the church and
[2:00:15] destroy it. He can't do it because it's
[2:00:18] a part of himself. Christ part of
[2:00:20] himself. The word being made flesh. Oh,
[2:00:24] amazing grace. How sweet the sound.
[2:00:26] Couldn't do it. You get it? He couldn't
[2:00:28] kill her. He couldn't take her life
[2:00:31] because she was part of Abraham and she
[2:00:33] was flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[2:00:35] bone. In our mistakes, don't say, "Well,
[2:00:38] I I made a failure." No. Abraham made
[2:00:40] failures, too. But he couldn't take the
[2:00:42] church. He couldn't kill the elected. He
[2:00:45] couldn't take your life because you're
[2:00:47] part of himself. You're the word. Amen.
[2:00:54] &gt;&gt; If it was up to us and our mistakes and
[2:00:57] our failures, surely we would deserve
[2:00:58] death. Absolutely. But we're a part of
[2:01:01] the prophecy. We're a part of the
[2:01:03] promise. We are a part of the word. We
[2:01:05] are the word made flesh in this day. And
[2:01:08] not our good works, not our ability, but
[2:01:10] the elective grace of God placed upon
[2:01:13] this bride. Hallelujah.
[2:01:15] &gt;&gt; Oh friends,
[2:01:18] &gt;&gt; the prophet of God says after the
[2:01:20] visitation,
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; he says,
[2:01:24] he says, the next morning, his shoulders
[2:01:27] began to straighten up
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; and the hump began to come out of his
[2:01:30] back. Her hair began to turn. They went
[2:01:33] back to young men and women just showing
[2:01:35] what he's going to do. The royal seed of
[2:01:37] Abraham to be changed in a moment, in
[2:01:39] the twinkling of eye, to be caught up
[2:01:41] together. And I want you to see this.
[2:01:43] the day before. She's over there in a
[2:01:45] bad mood. She's over there all fussy.
[2:01:47] She's over there just causing trouble in
[2:01:49] the church. She's over there all working
[2:01:50] things up. And she's even got problems
[2:01:52] in her heart of doubt and and how could
[2:01:54] it be me and I don't see this? But
[2:01:56] because she was a part of the prophecy,
[2:01:58] the prophet told us multiple times, he
[2:02:01] says after that visitation, the next
[2:02:03] morning, Abraham looked over and Sarah
[2:02:05] was turning young again. Hallelujah.
[2:02:09] &gt;&gt; The rapture taking place the day after
[2:02:12] you woke up with a bad attitude.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; It's not about you. It's his word. It's
[2:02:20] his promise. It's his prophecy. Get your
[2:02:23] eyes off yourself and look at the word.
[2:02:26] Look at the prophecy. Look at the
[2:02:28] promise. His word will never fail.
[2:02:30] Heavens and earth will pass away, but
[2:02:32] that word will not fail. There will be a
[2:02:35] bride. She'll be without spot and
[2:02:37] without wrinkle. There will be a bride.
[2:02:39] Oh, my heart jumps for joy to know that
[2:02:42] there will be a bride again in this last
[2:02:44] day.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, if the musicians would come.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Rapturing grace is not coming.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; It's here.
[2:02:57] &gt;&gt; We've received the visitation, friends.
[2:02:59] We've received the visitation of the son
[2:03:01] of man. I'm not looking for another day.
[2:03:03] I'm not looking for another age because
[2:03:06] I know that after that visitation, it
[2:03:08] was the very next morning that their
[2:03:10] bodies were changed. And so I'm not
[2:03:12] looking for another messenger. I'm not
[2:03:14] looking for another message. I have
[2:03:16] received everything that I have need of
[2:03:18] for the changing of this mortal body.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Let's just stand to our feet.
[2:03:28] Thank you.
[2:03:31] &gt;&gt; Couple months ago, I
[2:03:34] went down to Honduras and went way back
[2:03:37] in there. You know, I grew up up in the
[2:03:40] mountains in Arizona. And our favorite
[2:03:42] thing to do was to hike up in the
[2:03:43] mountains and hunt rattlesnakes and
[2:03:45] rabbits for food and just live off the
[2:03:47] land. And
[2:03:49] you know, and that was a part of God's
[2:03:50] purpose for my life because I've had the
[2:03:53] opportunity now to go out to these areas
[2:03:56] and they don't have running water. They
[2:03:58] don't have electricity. They don't have
[2:04:00] a bed to sleep on.
[2:04:02] And I'm actually I'm happy to be there.
[2:04:08] And I went there and you know they don't
[2:04:10] have running water so the bathroom if
[2:04:13] they have one, it's just an outhouse.
[2:04:16] and they go and they dig a great big pit
[2:04:18] and they they put a little shed over top
[2:04:21] of it and that's your that's your
[2:04:23] bathroom and they don't smell too good.
[2:04:26] They're pretty awful places. And one
[2:04:28] morning I got up and went down to the
[2:04:30] outhouse and getting up close to it and
[2:04:32] kind of calling out, "Hey, anybody
[2:04:34] home?" You know, and I hear these really
[2:04:36] weird noises coming out of the outhouse
[2:04:38] and I'm just like, "What's going on?"
[2:04:40] you know, and I go up in there and I
[2:04:43] look around and I look down in the down
[2:04:46] in the water down there. Well, water. I
[2:04:50] look down in there and there's a pig.
[2:04:53] He's just swimming around.
[2:04:56] Swimming around in all the sewage,
[2:04:58] you know. And you know, when he when he
[2:05:00] hopped in there, I mean, he was a happy
[2:05:03] pig.
[2:05:04] He jumped in there. I mean, it was
[2:05:06] everything he could have ever wanted.
[2:05:11] But you know, when I found him,
[2:05:14] he was drowning.
[2:05:17] He was going down under those water and
[2:05:20] struggling back up, trying to climb out.
[2:05:23] He couldn't get out. Walls were too
[2:05:26] high.
[2:05:28] And he's he's down there drowning in
[2:05:30] that filth.
[2:05:33] It just it burdened me. I I wanted to
[2:05:37] help him, but but
[2:05:42] you know, I I I like bacon. I enjoy
[2:05:45] bacon,
[2:05:47] but not that much cuz I mean, there was
[2:05:50] just there's only a little hole there,
[2:05:52] you know, and trying to get down and
[2:05:54] pull them out of I I just walked away. I
[2:05:57] just It bothered me and I just I had to
[2:05:59] leave. And I went up and told them up at
[2:06:01] the little hut up there. I'm like, "Hey
[2:06:03] guys, pig in the toilet." You know,
[2:06:07] like, and they just kind of laughed at
[2:06:08] me and it's like, "Oh, you know, goofy
[2:06:11] American, you know, he doesn't know how
[2:06:13] it works out here or something. I don't
[2:06:14] know. I couldn't understand it, you
[2:06:16] know."
[2:06:19] But I began to think about it
[2:06:22] cuz one time I was in that hole.
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; One time I was down in the pit.
[2:06:30] You see, I I wasn't going to get that
[2:06:32] pig because to get that pig, I'd have to
[2:06:34] get dirty with him.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; But when I was in the pit,
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; there was somebody that came
[2:06:43] &gt;&gt; and he became sin for me.
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; That he might reach in and pull me out
[2:06:55] [Music]
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; and he pulled me out of that. Why would
[2:06:59] he do it? I'm not worth anything more
[2:07:02] than just a pig. There's nothing about
[2:07:04] me that's good. But you see, he had
[2:07:06] grace on me.
[2:07:11] And his love was so great. He came and
[2:07:13] he redeemed me and he took me out of the
[2:07:16] pit.
[2:07:18] And then he cleansed me by the washing
[2:07:20] of the water of the word. He purified me
[2:07:23] with his blood. And then he set his
[2:07:26] elective grace on me to be his bride.
[2:07:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a grace.
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a grace that would come and
[2:07:36] would redeem us and call us. It wasn't
[2:07:39] when we were good, but while we were yet
[2:07:41] dead in sin.
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy
[2:07:49] &gt;&gt; came and redeemed me.
[2:07:52] [Music]
[2:07:54] Oh, it's the grace of God that has
[2:07:56] reached out his hand and taken us the
[2:07:59] beggars off of the dung hill and set us
[2:08:01] into the palace as a princess.
[2:08:04] [Music]
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Oh, just worship him this morning.
[2:08:12] Oh, give him your love and your
[2:08:14] appreciation. For there was no good
[2:08:16] thing in any man, but his love, his
[2:08:19] grace was so great, it came down to
[2:08:22] redeem us.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, how we love you, Lord.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; How we thank you.
[2:08:31] If not for
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; goody

[2:09:26] Give me the praise.
[2:09:30] Give God the grace. Amazing grace.

[2:10:16] my soul
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:29] praise.
[2:10:30] [Music]
[2:10:36] You are the one
[2:10:41] that you see.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[2:10:45] &gt;&gt; Through eyes of love,
[2:10:49] a hopeless case,
[2:10:52] an empty place.
[2:10:55] [Music]
[2:10:57] What a wonderful grace. What a wonderful
[2:11:00] grace.
[2:11:01] [Music]
[2:11:04] If there's someone here that doesn't
[2:11:05] have that assurance in your heart, why
[2:11:08] don't you take that assurance today?
[2:11:11] Why don't you let him give you that
[2:11:13] assurance in your heart?
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; He can give you the token.
[2:11:18] It's a reality, friends.
[2:11:22] The presence of the Lord that you feel
[2:11:24] in this building
[2:11:27] can so make your heart know
[2:11:32] that you are his
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; and that you will be there.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've still got time. If
[2:11:39] there's someone here that wants to give
[2:11:41] your life to the Lord, maybe maybe
[2:11:43] you've never given your life to the
[2:11:45] Lord. You want these brothers to pray
[2:11:46] with you.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; You're welcome.
[2:11:51] If you need the baptism of the Holy
[2:11:53] Spirit, why why not just accept it right
[2:11:56] where you are?
[2:11:58] Accept God's grace upon your life.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; It's his love.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; It's his grace upon you.
[2:12:07] Oh, bless the name of the Lord.
[2:12:10] I see tears all over the building. It's
[2:12:13] God here confirming his word to you. Not
[2:12:16] that you have to cry, but there's
[2:12:19] something about your soul. There is a
[2:12:21] there is a revelation. It's the Holy
[2:12:23] Spirit coming in an invisible union
[2:12:27] making this word live. Come off of the
[2:12:30] pages in your heart on your life.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of Jesus. A hopeless
[2:12:37] case,

[2:12:40] an empty place.

[2:12:55] the sound.
[2:12:57] I once was lost,
[2:13:01] but now I'm found.
[2:13:05] A hope is
[2:13:09] an empty place.
[2:13:14] If not, oh, let's sing it again. Amazing
[2:13:19] grace,
[2:13:22] how sweet the sound.
[2:13:26] I once was lost. Hallelujah.
[2:13:30] But now I'm found.
[2:13:33] I was a hopeless case,
[2:13:38] an empty case
[2:13:42] if not for grace.
[2:13:47] Hallelujah.
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Do you love him?
[2:13:56] Glory to God.
[2:13:59] Glory to God. Glory to God.
[2:14:03] [Music]
[2:14:05] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; Oh
[2:14:12] an empty
[2:14:14] place.
[2:14:15] [Music]
[2:14:21] No one knew
[2:14:23] how alone I was
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; at the emptiness.
[2:14:32] I tried so hard to hide.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; No, I laughed and said
[2:14:42] fine without you. Yeah,
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; I was covering up.
[2:14:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; I
[2:14:54] didn't waste
[2:14:57] [Music]
[2:14:59] of mercy.
[2:15:04] And the love you show
[2:15:07] [Music]
[2:15:12] you.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Oh glory and purchase my redemption
[2:15:20] when you broke his power. You set my
[2:15:23] spirit free
[2:15:28] [Music]
[2:15:29] [Applause]
[2:15:32] without you.
[2:15:34] Jesus, I'm amazed.
[2:15:38] I'm amazed how you can
[2:15:44] through your grace.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:15:48] Glory.
[2:15:50] Hallelujah.
[2:15:52] And my sins,
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; all my sins are
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; washed away.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; All my sins
[2:16:02] are washed
[2:16:04] away.
[2:16:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:16:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's true.
[2:16:10] There's been days when I
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; Lord, you go the time I've gone astray.
[2:16:23] Lord, I learn your love stronger than my
[2:16:29] weakness.
[2:16:32] And your ears are
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. What a loving God.

[2:20:23] [Music]
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; What a revelation.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; That's what God has wanted in this day.
[2:20:34] This is the rapturing time. And that's
[2:20:36] why God
[2:20:39] He would always send a prophet right at
[2:20:40] the junctions of time. He always sent
[2:20:44] those messengers to come. He had to have
[2:20:46] a Noah to make sure that there was a
[2:20:49] people prepared. Get ready now. I'm
[2:20:52] fixing to do something. He had to send a
[2:20:55] Moses. Get ready. I'm fixing to do
[2:20:58] something. You'll miss it if if you
[2:21:00] don't really catch who you are and what
[2:21:03] I'm doing. He's always had the junctions
[2:21:06] of time and he always has that messenger
[2:21:09] to say, "Don't get caught up. Hey, get
[2:21:11] your eyes off everything else. I've got
[2:21:13] a purpose for you."
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; And God is saying in this day, listen,
[2:21:18] don't get caught up in the world
[2:21:21] affairs,
[2:21:22] wars. Don't get caught up in
[2:21:27] Democrat, Republican affairs. Don't get
[2:21:30] caught up in these that that's not who
[2:21:32] you are.
[2:21:34] You're my bride.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Keep your eyes single. Keep your eye on
[2:21:39] me. No,
[2:21:41] no spiritual adultery, flirting with
[2:21:44] this and that and the other. Just keep
[2:21:46] your eyes upon me.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; I'm yours and you're mine.
[2:21:52] &gt;&gt; Be ready.
[2:21:55] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that you are that
[2:21:57] rapture?
[2:21:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that the revelation has
[2:22:00] come that you are that bride?
[2:22:03] God bless you today,
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Zachary. That was that was a
[2:22:10] masterpiece.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
