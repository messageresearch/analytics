[14:18] go to prayer here this morning if I may
[14:21] and ask brother Kayla Martin if you
[14:23] would mind coming and leading us in
[14:24] prayer. We do have a few needs. Uh one
[14:27] for for sister Angie McDougall says
[14:30] she's in severe pain this morning and is
[14:32] scheduled on Wednesday to remove her
[14:34] gall bladder. So let's remember her in
[14:36] prayer. And also uh sister Denise King
[14:39] is at home feeling sick this morning.
[14:42] And then dad sent a request uh from
[14:45] brother Steve Martin. He's been
[14:48] struggling in his health and even uh to
[14:51] walk because of his MS. Says, "Good
[14:54] morning. Would you have the church to
[14:56] remember me in your prayers this
[14:58] morning?" So let's remember brother
[15:00] Steve Martin. And if there's anyone that
[15:01] has a need upon your heart, just make it
[15:04] known by the lifting of your hand. God
[15:05] bless you
[15:07] now. Lord Jesus, we just love you.
[15:09] Father, we just want to say thank you
[15:11] for everything you do for us. Father, we
[15:13] see these these prayer requests. Sister
[15:16] Denise, Father, she's homesick. Father,
[15:18] we ask you whatever she's going through,
[15:20] whatever problem she's having in her
[15:21] body. Father, we ask you just to come
[15:24] down and meet her where she is. Father,

[15:28] issues, Father, we ask you to come down
[15:30] and just deliver her. You see, Brother
[15:33] Steve Martin, Father, we ask you to come
[15:35] down and just heal his body. Father, you
[15:39] see anybody else in here that's has any
[15:41] unspoken prayer requests? Father, we ask
[15:43] you to come down and just meet their
[15:44] needs. Father, we ask you to be

[19:30] saints of God are gathered home we will

[23:49] people locost everywhere whose hearts
[23:53] are all a flame with the fire that fell

[32:20] Oh Jim
[32:25] heaven. Amen. God bless you, brother
[32:32] Mike. Life is
[32:37] easy when you're up on the
[32:44] mountain. And you've got
[32:48] peace of
[32:51] mind that you've never known.
[32:59] But then things
[33:04] change. You're down in the
[33:12] valley. Don't lose
[33:15] faith,
[33:18] child. You're never alone.
[33:25] For the God on the
[33:30] mountain is still God in the
[33:34] [Music]
[33:37] valley. When things go
[33:44] wrong, he'll make them right.
[33:51] And the God of the good
[33:56] times is the God in the
[34:01] bad
[34:03] time. The God of the
[34:09] day is still God in the night.
[34:18] Talk a
[34:22] faith. You're up on the
[34:28] mountain. But talking so
[34:35] easy when life is best.
[34:43] But down in the
[34:48] valley comes trials and
[34:55] temptation. That's when
[34:58] faith
[35:01] is really put to the test.
[35:08] For the God on the
[35:13] mountain, it's the God in the
[35:20] valley. Where things go
[35:26] wrong, he'll make them right.
[35:33] And the God of the good
[35:38] times is still God in the bad
[35:43] [Music]
[35:45] times. The God of the
[35:50] day is the God in the
[35:56] night. For the God of the
[36:02] mountain is still God in the
[36:08] valley where things go
[36:13] wrong. He'll make him right.
[36:20] and the daughter of the good
[36:25] times is the God in the bad
[36:29] [Music]
[36:31] times. The God of the
[36:36] day is the God of the night.
[36:52] Amen. Can we stand and sing this as the
[36:55] man of God comes now? Oh, there are two
[37:00] roads you can
[37:05] take. One

[39:09] eagle in the
[39:11] sky. Oh my. He does not
[39:16] struggle. He does not strive.

[39:24] power that makes him

[40:22] high. Oh, speak the word of God. Yes.
[40:28] And by and
[40:31] by it will
[40:34] move. For you will fly.
[40:40] Set your
[40:42] wings oh to the wind of
[40:46] fes. You can
[40:50] fly in a higher
[40:52] [Music]
[41:06] place. Oh, let's sing it again.

[41:24] [Music]
[41:27] high
[41:28] [Music]
[41:29] struggle. It's by rain.
[41:35] Set your
[41:37] wings to the
[41:39] winds of
[41:41] faith. Set your
[41:45] wings to the winds of
[41:51] faith. Praise the Lord. Do you love him
[41:54] this
[41:55] morning? Isn't he wonderful to us
[41:58] all? Amen. And I'm so glad that we have
[42:03] access into this wonderful heavenly
[42:07] realm through the faith that God has
[42:09] given every one of us. Amen. Good to be

[42:36] nice and
[42:39] uh so we we sure uh appreciate that and
[42:44] looking forward to uh uh what God has
[42:48] has got. I know brother Joel's getting

[42:58] we're we're just looking forward to uh
[43:01] to those things there. Yes. Uh good good
[43:04] to see everyone. I thought I thought we
[43:06] also uh the uh the reception for Austin
[43:09] and Rose was just wonderful the other
[43:11] night and uh we we sure love Rose and
[43:16] good to have her here in Oklahoma. Let's
[43:19] let's look here in I've got two
[43:21] scriptures. They're in Zechariah the
[43:24] fourth chapter and then also um Romans
[43:29] the 5th
[43:30] chapter. And
[43:34] um
[43:37] we are sure thankful to to God for his
[43:42] message and um man for it is the evening
[43:46] time light. Amen.
[43:50] there in Zechariah 4 and1. And the angel
[43:54] that talked with me came again and wake
[43:57] me as a man that was waken out of his
[44:00] sleep. And he said unto me, what seeest
[44:03] thou? And I said, I have looked, and
[44:06] behold, a candlestick hall of gold with
[44:10] a bowl upon the top of it, and as seven
[44:13] lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the
[44:16] seven lamps, which are upon the top
[44:19] thereof, two olive trees by it, one upon
[44:24] the right side of the bowl, and the
[44:26] other upon the left side thereof. So I
[44:29] answered and spake unto the angel that
[44:31] talked with me, saying, What are these
[44:34] things, my lord? Or what are these? Then
[44:37] the angel that talked with me answered
[44:40] and saith unto me, Knowest thou not what
[44:43] these be? And I said, No, my Lord. Then
[44:48] he answered and spake unto me, saying,
[44:50] This is the word of the Lord unto
[44:53] Zerubabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
[44:57] power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord
[45:00] of
[45:01] hosts. Who art thou, oh great mountain,
[45:05] before Zerubabel, thou shalt become a
[45:07] plain? He shall bring forth the
[45:11] headstone thereof with shoutings,
[45:14] crying, grace,
[45:16] grace unto it. Amen. Let's also go to
[45:21] the book of Romans, the fifth
[45:24] chapter, and we will read the first two
[45:28] verses.
[45:30] Amen. So thankful for God's
[45:33] word. Praise the Lord. It says,
[45:35] "Therefore, being justified by faith, we
[45:39] have peace with God through our Lord
[45:41] Jesus
[45:42] Christ, by whom also we have
[45:46] access by faith into this grace, wherein
[45:50] we stand and rejoice in hope of the
[45:54] glory of God." And we're going to take a
[45:58] a text out of that, access into grace by
[46:03] faith. Let's go to the Lord in prayer.
[46:06] Father, we want to thank you today for
[46:09] your your kindness and your goodness,
[46:12] Lord. Thankful, Lord, for all that you
[46:16] are. Thank you for our little
[46:18] congregation here, Lord, and all the
[46:20] laborers, Lord, from Lord, those who uh
[46:25] assist in the cleaning and and Sister
[46:28] Stephanie keeping keeping it all in
[46:31] charge. Lord, the for those who are who
[46:34] are doing the cooking, Lord. Sister Keys
[46:38] who helps keep that it going. And thank
[46:41] you, Lord, for our trustees, our our our
[46:44] deacon, Lord, our song leaders, our
[46:47] musicians. Just Lord, today as I as I
[46:52] stand here, I thank you for all of
[46:55] those, Lord, our Sunday school teachers
[46:58] who labor, Lord. And I Lord, we're doing
[47:02] it for one purpose and that is for your
[47:04] kingdom. And I just pray that you would
[47:07] bless all of those laborers here, Lord.
[47:10] Father, I ask that you would bless the
[47:12] congregation. I I pray, Lord, that that
[47:16] your grace would be with us here this
[47:18] morning. Father, we don't come by our
[47:23] own works and our own abilities, Lord,
[47:26] but we we come because you have called
[47:30] us and ordained us to this grace. Now,
[47:34] Father, we just ask that you would be
[47:36] with us today in the name of the Lord
[47:38] Jesus Christ. Can the church say
[47:41] amen? And amen. God bless you. You can
[47:44] be seated
[47:46] here. Amen.
[47:49] We are very thankful. Thank God for
[47:53] every one of you. And we don't say it
[47:57] often enough, but you know, as we I was
[48:00] thinking the other day when brother
[48:02] Michael had
[48:03] mentioned put on the chat um have a
[48:07] little have a little time and and um and
[48:10] everyone all showed up right after work.
[48:12] I thought, you know, I just it it's, you
[48:15] know, it's just so good to be a part of
[48:18] uh of people who who who are behind a
[48:23] vision. And um we we you know our we
[48:28] this this church would be nothing
[48:30] without without the congregation. And um
[48:34] with without those who are who are
[48:37] willing to see um these things go
[48:40] forward and and um and so we we thank
[48:44] every one of you for all all of your
[48:47] labors of love that you do. just, you
[48:49] know, you're not you're not always uh u
[48:53] given accolades, but you are you are
[48:56] very much appreciated.
[48:59] Can I hear a great big amen?
[49:02] Amen. I I want to minister here this
[49:06] morning as on the access into
[49:10] grace by faith.
[49:14] We I I as as I uh been for some time um
[49:21] thinking along lines of God's great love
[49:25] wherewith he loves us and and the amen
[49:30] the the graciousness of God's love to
[49:33] us. And as we read there in
[49:36] Zechariah, Eman talking about the two
[49:40] trees and and also about the amen the
[49:45] candlesticks and
[49:47] and Zerubabel was a man uh was anointed
[49:54] to rebuild the temple. He was he was the
[49:58] great prince that God had placed his
[50:00] hand upon. He he was to lay again the
[50:04] foundation of the temple but he was also
[50:08] to bring the
[50:09] headstone of the building. Now he didn't
[50:12] say the cornerstone but the headstone.
[50:15] So it would be the relaying of the
[50:17] foundation of the of the temple. Amen.
[50:20] But it would also be the capstone coming
[50:23] down and finishing it. And uh of course
[50:27] these this was uh uh talking about
[50:31] Israel and and the building of the
[50:32] temple, but it was also a type, amen, of
[50:36] the of the seven church ages, the seven
[50:39] candlesticks. And we would have the two
[50:42] olive trees, which would be the new the
[50:45] old and new testament. And and it would
[50:48] be in this last day that God's great
[50:51] prince, God's great prophet, he would be
[50:54] a restoration prophet. Amen. Under the
[50:57] anointing of Elijah. And Elijah rebuilt
[51:01] the altar of God. He didn't bring new
[51:04] stones, but he rebuilt the altar of God.
[51:08] Amen. And restored the worship the way
[51:11] God wanted it. And so this Elijah that
[51:15] is to come. Amen. The seventh day
[51:18] messenger would to would be to restore
[51:22] the beginnings. We restore uh uh the
[51:26] church and to lay again the foundation.
[51:29] Amen. And in this day would also bring
[51:33] on the capstone in this capstone age.
[51:37] Amen. This is this is the day that
[51:40] you're living in. Amen. But there would
[51:42] be a cry, a shouting that would that
[51:46] would go out that would say grace, grace
[51:50] unto this capstone as it is coming down.
[51:55] We understand the capstone is the
[51:58] finishing up of redemption. It is it is
[52:01] the word age or the bride age or the
[52:05] capstone age as brother Brennham would
[52:07] bring it in many many ways. But the as
[52:11] this stone is coming down, there was a
[52:14] cry. Amen. A shouting, a crying out,
[52:19] grace, grace unto this capstone. And he
[52:24] would say, this is the word of the Lord
[52:27] unto Zerubbabel. Not by might, nor by
[52:31] power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord
[52:35] of hosts. Amen. It would be a it would
[52:39] be a working of grace. It would be God
[52:42] from the start to the finish. There
[52:44] would be no Amen. Nothing that would you
[52:48] would be able to add to it or I would be
[52:50] able to add to it. It would be divine
[52:52] grace. Of course, grace does mean divine
[52:56] favor. It's the divine gift. It is the
[53:00] unmarited favor of God upon one's life.
[53:04] And I as as I was thinking
[53:06] here, excuse me if I as I was thinking
[53:09] here today, amen, of God's grace, I I I
[53:13] I don't think there's anything greater
[53:15] than God's grace. Amen. We can talk of
[53:18] God's power. We can talk about Amen.
[53:21] many of the attributes of God, but if it
[53:24] had not been for the grace of God in
[53:27] your life, you would not know the power
[53:29] of God. Amen. The power of God is is is
[53:33] wonderful. But the grace of God is what
[53:36] pulls you and separates you to himself
[53:40] to say, "Amen. I have called you to
[53:43] exhibit my power through." Amen. I I I
[53:46] think that's a that's a wonderful thing
[53:48] that we could have. Amen. Grace is God's
[53:51] world. Grace is God's nature. Grace is
[53:55] who God is. He is a God of divine grace.
[53:59] Amen. Grace is unmmerited. Grace is
[54:02] unlimited. Grace is unhampered. Grace is
[54:05] boundless. Amen. Grace, when we think of
[54:08] grace, we are saying there is nothing to
[54:11] restrict its purpose. There is nothing
[54:14] to hinder its cause. When God looks upon
[54:19] you and favors you, there is nothing
[54:24] that can deter God's grace upon your
[54:28] life.
[54:29] Amen. It's unmmerited healing. It's
[54:32] unlimited uh salvation. It is it is
[54:36] unhampered deliverance. It is boundless
[54:39] freedom. Amen. It is grace upon your
[54:43] life. Amen. When God wanted to Amen. to
[54:45] say he when he wanted to express he says
[54:48] it is pressed down, shaken together and
[54:51] running over. Amen. Ephesians 3:18, it
[54:54] says, "May be able to comprehend with
[54:57] all saints, the elect of God, what is
[55:00] the breadth and the length and the depth
[55:03] and the height, and to know the love of
[55:05] God, of the love of Christ, which passes
[55:08] knowledge, that ye may be filled with
[55:10] the fullness of God unto him that is
[55:14] able to do
[55:16] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[55:20] would ever ask or pink according to the
[55:23] power that workketh in us. How is that
[55:27] power workketh in you? It is by grace.
[55:30] It is God's grace upon your life that
[55:34] brings these things to pass in you. Oh,
[55:39] your family is favored. Amen. If you've
[55:42] I if you're standing upon the word of
[55:44] the Lord, Amen. you are favored. If
[55:47] there is something there that is that
[55:49] that that is uh that is drawing you, you
[55:52] are favored here this morning. Amen.
[55:55] Now, now the opposite of grace is works.
[55:59] The opposite of grace, amen, is
[56:02] knowledge and and and working and and
[56:05] and trying and struggling. This is the
[56:09] opposite of grace because once you come
[56:12] into grace, it is all divine works. It
[56:17] is a divine God with a divine power
[56:21] working his divine works through you. So
[56:24] it is no longer you that lives but it is
[56:28] Christ that is living in you. Amen. Now
[56:32] God is is the very nature of grace.
[56:36] Amen. Grace is as old as as creation is
[56:39] itself. Amen. By grace, God favored man
[56:43] above all that he created. He created
[56:47] man in his very own image. Now, he could
[56:50] have he could have created anything to
[56:53] to to have dominion, but it was God's
[56:56] grace that God gave Adam and made him
[57:01] the ruler of the earth. The authority
[57:04] and dominion was given unto Adam because
[57:08] of God's grace. God's favor, God's
[57:12] unlimited power was given unto Adam.
[57:17] Amen. Because God favored Adam.
[57:21] Favored Adam over all of the animal
[57:23] life. Favored Adam. Hey, God could have
[57:25] had the son to preach the gospel the
[57:27] prophets at. God could have called the
[57:29] Amen. He could have had anything doing
[57:31] it. But God favored Adam. God favored
[57:35] man. And God's grace was exhibited.
[57:38] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Now, when
[57:42] he gave Adam and Eve the one command,
[57:45] Amen. or the one law to live by, we find
[57:49] that Eve crossed the separating line and
[57:52] broke that commandment. Amen. And and
[57:54] and and then she enticed her husband to
[57:57] eat. Amen. And a law, in order for it to
[58:01] be a law, it's got to have, amen, a
[58:04] penalty or it is no law. Amen. And the
[58:07] day you eat thereof, you shall surely
[58:10] die. Can you say amen? Now remember, the
[58:13] first judgment seat on earth was in the
[58:16] garden. Amen. That was the first
[58:18] judgment seat. The last judgment seat is
[58:21] going to be on earth also. It's the
[58:23] white throne judgment. Amen. But you
[58:26] see, Amen. I I I as I as I have as I've
[58:29] thought about this so many times here
[58:31] lately, as I've been thinking about the
[58:33] love of God and and and and just sort of
[58:36] preaching along these lines, Amen. I I
[58:39] can imagine a as as that first couple at
[58:42] sin, all nature must have been paralyzed
[58:45] as Amen. as they held their peace. Amen.
[58:49] That day uh uh was Amen. I would imagine
[58:52] it being gloomy and and black as the sun
[58:56] hid its face and the stars refused to
[58:59] shine and birds stopped chirping. Amen.
[59:03] And and and held their peace because sin
[59:06] had come in and blotted it all out.
[59:09] Amen. Now you say, "Well, now what makes
[59:11] you think that?" Well, that's what
[59:13] happened. Amen. When sin when when Jesus
[59:15] died, the death for you and me. Amen.
[59:19] that that the that that the that the
[59:19] that the that the the noon day become as
[59:21] dark. Why? Because sin he had taken the
[59:25] sin of humanity upon himself and he was
[59:30] dying that day. Well, can you say amen?
[59:32] Amen. Brother Brandham would say that's
[59:34] what's the matter with the churches
[59:35] today. That's what's the matter with the
[59:37] people. Sin has blotted out the light of
[59:40] the living God to show that Christ still
[59:43] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[59:46] And he lives to save to the uttermost
[59:48] and to heal to the lowest. And the sick
[59:51] person. Amen. Oh, how terrible it was
[59:55] that morning. Darkness hanging in the
[59:57] garden. I imagine the fog of black
[1:00:00] sackloth. I can imagine every leaf never
[1:00:03] moved and no wind stirring. It was
[1:00:06] darkness and terrible because sin had
[1:00:08] blotted it out. Then Jehovah come down
[1:00:12] like a roar of thunder, walking through
[1:00:14] the garden, crying, "Adam, where art
[1:00:17] thou?" Amen. Then that's when Adam
[1:00:20] realized he was naked and had sinned
[1:00:22] before God. He hid himself and tried to
[1:00:26] make himself a religion. But it didn't
[1:00:28] work. God killed some sheep and took the
[1:00:31] skins and showed that something had to
[1:00:34] die to cover sin. And joining church
[1:00:36] will never cover sin. No dryeyed
[1:00:39] confession will ever cover sin. It takes
[1:00:41] sorrow and repentance and the grace of
[1:00:45] God to cover sin. Can I hear an amen?
[1:00:47] For the blood of Jesus Christ, the one
[1:00:50] that God killed at Calvary to cover sin.
[1:00:54] He says, "There in the garden that
[1:00:55] morning when sin was so black, Jehovah
[1:00:58] come in, there stood his couple standing
[1:01:01] condemned and there would be no human
[1:01:04] race. They had to die. death on the
[1:01:06] human race and give the world back to
[1:01:08] the wild beast. There would be no human
[1:01:11] race. But in the darkest of hour, in
[1:01:14] that time when all hopes was gone, grace
[1:01:18] come pouring through and said, "I'll
[1:01:20] give you a savior, a Messiah." Amen.
[1:01:23] It's a wonder how God could ever do it.
[1:01:27] God's amazing grace in the Garden of
[1:01:29] Eden. Amen. That gave them the promise
[1:01:31] of a just one who would come through the
[1:01:34] woman. The woman's siege shall bruise
[1:01:37] the serpent's head, the guilty one and
[1:01:39] his head shall bruise her heel to show
[1:01:43] that there would be an affliction to the
[1:01:45] church. But he promised triumph. He
[1:01:49] promised a savior. He promised grace.
[1:01:53] Can you say amen? Amen. Oh yes. How
[1:01:57] could they show h how could they show to
[1:02:00] to merit grace? How could what could
[1:02:04] they show to do it? He met the old army
[1:02:06] expression. Excuse it. He says, uh,
[1:02:10] passing the buck, Adam said, the woman
[1:02:12] give it to me and did it. And and and
[1:02:15] the woman said, the serpent beguiled me.
[1:02:18] One laded to the other. Amen. To
[1:02:20] another. There was no hopes for them.
[1:02:22] But God provided grace. And it come
[1:02:26] breaking through. And he said, "I'll
[1:02:29] make a way
[1:02:31] somehow. I'm going to save you
[1:02:33] regardless. You've done wrong. You've
[1:02:36] trespassed my laws, and my laws will
[1:02:39] have to be, but judgment from my laws
[1:02:42] will have to be executed. Therefore,
[1:02:45] there will have to be death because I
[1:02:48] said death." Can you say amen? But grace
[1:02:51] would find a way. And you know, I I I
[1:02:54] just want to say once again, grace.
[1:02:57] Amen. Grace. A everyone just say it with
[1:03:00] me. Unlimited.
[1:03:04] Unmmerited.
[1:03:06] Unhampered.
[1:03:08] Boundless.
[1:03:11] God's grace is sufficient. Well, praise
[1:03:14] the Lord. Amen. The Apostle Paul, Amen.
[1:03:18] as as he was struggling there in and and
[1:03:21] and fighting and at and and a thorn in
[1:03:24] the flesh and and he was asking God, I I
[1:03:27] need help. And God answered him and
[1:03:30] says, "My grace is sufficient for you."
[1:03:34] Amen. When God says, "My grace is
[1:03:36] sufficient," he's talking about the
[1:03:38] boundless grace, the unmarited grace,
[1:03:42] the grace beyond human ability to where
[1:03:45] his anointing up you will bring forth
[1:03:49] his presence, his promise to you. Can
[1:03:52] you say amen? Amen. To comprehend with
[1:03:55] all the saints. Amen. To comprehend.
[1:03:58] Well, glory to God. Amen. I'm so
[1:04:00] thankful for that grace would find a
[1:04:03] way. Amen. Would it be right for God to
[1:04:06] make an angel to die in man's place? No.
[1:04:09] Would it be right? Amen. Could Could Eve
[1:04:12] die in man's place? No. She caused the
[1:04:15] sin. Amen. Was there anyone else that
[1:04:18] could die that could pay the price?
[1:04:20] Amen. That God's great law demanded. No.
[1:04:24] There was no one could do it. But God
[1:04:27] himself took on a body of flesh. Amen.
[1:04:32] He didn't just do it for Adam, but he
[1:04:34] knew there was going to be a Patrick
[1:04:35] Wade that needed. He knew there was
[1:04:37] going to be a Wendell Martin that
[1:04:39] needed. He knew there was going to be a
[1:04:41] Joe Green that needed it. He knew there
[1:04:43] was going to be an Alustin Stout that
[1:04:45] needed. God's grace stepped up. Amen.
[1:04:50] when you couldn't provide it, when you
[1:04:53] couldn't do it, it was God's grace that
[1:04:56] came down to you and said, "I am
[1:04:59] unlimited in what I can do.
[1:05:05] I'm
[1:05:06] unlimited." Amen. So, the great
[1:05:09] invisible God, he didn't send He didn't
[1:05:12] send a second person or the Godhead and
[1:05:14] say, "Hey, you got to die. Somebody's
[1:05:16] got to stay up here and keep things
[1:05:18] running." Amen. And God himself, God
[1:05:21] himself came down in a body of flesh and
[1:05:25] died the human death. Amen. And paid
[1:05:29] your price. Can you say amen? Amen. It
[1:05:33] never was what you deserve. It was
[1:05:35] grace. It never will be what you
[1:05:38] deserve. It is grace. Brother Bradom
[1:05:41] would say, let me say this, my sinner
[1:05:44] friend. You may be here this morning a
[1:05:46] prostitute. You may be here this morning
[1:05:49] a woman chaser. You may be here a
[1:05:51] drunker or a gambler or a murderer. You
[1:05:55] might be here as an impure husband, an
[1:05:58] impure wife. You might be the vilest of
[1:06:01] sinners. You say, "I'm past the stage of
[1:06:04] redemption." No, you're not or you
[1:06:07] wouldn't be at this church this morning.
[1:06:10] Grace will make a way for you in the
[1:06:14] darkest hour if you'll just accept it.
[1:06:18] Adam had to be willing to accept it. And
[1:06:21] so do you. So accept it.
[1:06:29] Amen. So grace in
[1:06:31] itself
[1:06:33] extended is not everything there is to
[1:06:37] it. There has got to be an accepting of
[1:06:41] that grace. Can you say amen?
[1:06:44] This brings us to our text. Amen. For we
[1:06:49] have
[1:06:50] access into this
[1:06:52] grace by faith.
[1:06:56] This this faith. There's got to be
[1:06:59] somebody that will appropriate the grace
[1:07:02] in your life.
[1:07:04] Grace has come and it's called and it's
[1:07:08] provided. But the door to access it is
[1:07:11] faith. Amen. Faith to do it. Amen.
[1:07:15] Remember what we had just said. Being
[1:07:18] justified, Romans 5:1. Being therefore
[1:07:20] justified by faith, we have peace with
[1:07:23] God through our Lord Jesus Christ. by
[1:07:25] whom also we have access by faith into
[1:07:29] this grace wherein we stand and rejoice
[1:07:32] in hope of the glory of God. Can you say
[1:07:36] amen? Amen. So what is faith? Faith is
[1:07:39] the access into the realm of the
[1:07:41] supernatural world of God. Amen. You
[1:07:44] want into this. Do you want in access
[1:07:46] into the supernatural unlimited
[1:07:49] bountless amen power of God? you. Faith
[1:07:53] gives you that access into it. Faith is
[1:07:56] convinced that God is right. Faith is
[1:07:58] convinced that grace is for me. Faith is
[1:08:01] convinced that God would never call me
[1:08:03] if he could not keep me. Grace says you
[1:08:06] started me. Well, praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:08:09] Faith says God's grace that has started
[1:08:12] me out is going to finish me and
[1:08:16] complete me because his grace is
[1:08:20] boundless. Amen.
[1:08:24] Oh, in this day of rapture, in this day
[1:08:28] of rapture where God is commanding the
[1:08:32] church to be
[1:08:34] perfect, when God is commanding and he's
[1:08:37] saying, "I'm taking a church into the
[1:08:41] rapture."
[1:08:42] Hallelujah. As the headstone is coming
[1:08:46] down, the capstone is coming. Glory be
[1:08:50] to the lamb of God. God's not crying
[1:08:52] works, work, work, work. God is crying
[1:08:56] grace, grace,
[1:08:59] grace. Oh, hallelujah. Oh, can you say
[1:09:02] amen? Amen. It's never been your
[1:09:05] ability. It'll never be your ability.
[1:09:07] It'll be by by by faith in the access of
[1:09:11] God. Amen. the the the grace of God
[1:09:14] there in Ephesians 1:18 the eyes of your
[1:09:17] understanding being enlightened that you
[1:09:20] may know somebody say that you may know
[1:09:25] what is the hope of his calling and what
[1:09:27] the riches of the glory of his
[1:09:30] inheritance in the
[1:09:31] saints Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the
[1:09:36] substance of things hoped for and the
[1:09:39] evidence of things not seen amen I'm
[1:09:42] standing ing here this morning and faith
[1:09:44] is reaching out. Amen. Into that rim of
[1:09:47] grace, into that rim of impossibility,
[1:09:51] into that rim where all things are
[1:09:53] possible. And faith is saying, "It is
[1:09:56] mine." Faith is saying, "I believe it."
[1:09:59] Faith is saying, "I'll access it." Faith
[1:10:02] is saying, "Lord, whatever you've for
[1:10:04] me, I will take it." Can you say,
[1:10:07] "Amen."
[1:10:10] Amen. Brother Random would say that your
[1:10:14] faith is the
[1:10:15] door and you open. Now, you know, you
[1:10:19] open the door to go in into a room. In
[1:10:22] order to get into this room, you had to
[1:10:23] open the door to come in. Amen. But
[1:10:27] those doors are also used to lock people
[1:10:29] out. Amen. So, a door can lock out and a
[1:10:32] Lord a door can open
[1:10:34] up. Amen. And ironically, it's in this
[1:10:38] last church age that Christ is on the
[1:10:41] outside and the door is locked
[1:10:46] and he's knocking. Grace is
[1:10:49] knocking. Power is knocking. Unlimited.
[1:10:53] The unlimited world of God is knocking,
[1:10:57] but the door is locked.
[1:11:01] Now could you imagine coming to church
[1:11:03] where the unlimited God is and we have
[1:11:06] locked it. Well, how do you lock it?
[1:11:09] Faith and love go hand in hand. And so
[1:11:12] when love when love is is is has has
[1:11:17] been jeopardized, faith can no longer
[1:11:20] work.
[1:11:21] Faith can no longer work. You love God,
[1:11:24] therefore you believe. How can you say
[1:11:27] you love God when you can't love your
[1:11:29] brother?
[1:11:31] So faith, Amen, will either be that door
[1:11:35] will either be locked or that door will
[1:11:38] be opened. We will either walk in the
[1:11:41] walk with God or the grace of God or we
[1:11:44] will just be church members.
[1:11:47] And church members at best can only do
[1:11:50] works. Show up and it is hard. They
[1:11:52] don't want to come to church. They don't
[1:11:54] want to participate. They don't want to
[1:11:56] be. It's works.
[1:11:59] Amen. And at best, it's works to look
[1:12:02] good among among your friends.
[1:12:06] But God's not wanting us to look good
[1:12:07] here this morning. God's not wanting us
[1:12:10] to see what kind of clothes we're
[1:12:12] wearing here this morning. God's wanting
[1:12:14] us to open the door of faith to go into
[1:12:17] a world of an unlimited God, an
[1:12:20] unlimited resource. We praise the name
[1:12:22] of the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah. Brother
[1:12:25] Brandham talked about India. He says
[1:12:27] India in India has some of the greatest
[1:12:32] of the world's resources. It is some of
[1:12:34] the greatest. They're untapped. Amen.
[1:12:37] But he says because they don't have the
[1:12:41] ability or they don't have the faith.
[1:12:43] They can't see the potential that they
[1:12:47] have. He says they're sitting on top of
[1:12:51] unlimited resources and dying and
[1:12:55] starving and or a third world country.
[1:12:58] He says if they could put their faith
[1:13:02] into action, they would get those
[1:13:04] resources and become a wealthy nation.
[1:13:07] He says that's the way it is in the
[1:13:10] church. Amen. We'll sit there and say I
[1:13:14] wish, I want, I hope. Amen. Oh, we'll
[1:13:18] get our faith out and say, "God's got
[1:13:20] the resources. God's given us the grace.
[1:13:23] He's given us the ability. I'm going to
[1:13:26] stand." Well, can you say amen? I'm
[1:13:28] going to rise to the occasion because
[1:13:31] the grace of God has been extended to
[1:13:33] me.
[1:13:37] Power within you came by grace.
[1:13:42] Can you say amen?
[1:13:44] So you can either open God's grace to
[1:13:46] you or close
[1:13:48] it. Faith is the
[1:13:51] access. What is the access? It's a means
[1:13:54] of approaching. Access is a means of
[1:13:57] approaching or entering a place. It's
[1:13:59] the entrance or the way in. Amen.
[1:14:03] And brother Brandon would tell us the
[1:14:05] only way that you can
[1:14:07] access me is through
[1:14:10] humility and believing there in the
[1:14:13] message of grace. Brother Brandham would
[1:14:14] say, "But because Noah feared God, he
[1:14:17] believed God." You can't fear God
[1:14:20] without believing. How can you fear
[1:14:22] something you don't believe? You got to
[1:14:24] fear God. Solomon said, "The fear of God
[1:14:27] is the beginning of wisdom." Now, just
[1:14:29] to fear God, you're beginning to have
[1:14:31] wisdom. The fear of God, Noah feared the
[1:14:35] Lord and he believed the Lord. And
[1:14:38] that's what God honors is your faith in
[1:14:40] him. That's right. Then when the fear of
[1:14:43] God come upon Noah, God called him by
[1:14:47] grace, saved him in his house because it
[1:14:49] was grace that did that. Well, praise
[1:14:53] the Lord. Can I just put it this way?
[1:14:55] The more humble that you become, the
[1:14:59] greater the access into that realm with
[1:15:02] God. The more humble you become, the
[1:15:07] greater the access is to this grace. You
[1:15:11] say, "Brother Wendon, I don't see that
[1:15:12] in the scripture." Well, sure you do.
[1:15:15] We've we've looked over it many of
[1:15:16] times, but there in in James 4 and6, I
[1:15:19] believe it is, he says he giveth more
[1:15:23] grace unto Amen. He He giveth more grace
[1:15:27] wherein he uh he saith God resisteth the
[1:15:30] proud, but he giveth grace unto the
[1:15:33] humble. Let's just read a couple of
[1:15:34] verses there. Amen. Submit yourselves
[1:15:37] therefore to God. Resist the devil, and
[1:15:40] he will flee from you. Draw nigh to God
[1:15:43] and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse
[1:15:45] your hands, you sinners. Purify your
[1:15:48] hearts, you double-minded, and be
[1:15:50] afflicted and mourn and weep and let
[1:15:53] your laughter be turned to mourning and
[1:15:56] your joy to heaviness. Amen. Humble
[1:15:59] yourselves in the sight of the Lord and
[1:16:04] he will give you
[1:16:07] grace. Hallelujah.
[1:16:10] lifting you up is grace. Amen.
[1:16:15] Approaching God through humility.
[1:16:18] Approaching God in the in the form,
[1:16:21] Amen. of not not not uh you know, when
[1:16:24] he's talking about brokenness and being
[1:16:26] afflicted and mourning, he's not saying,
[1:16:29] "Amen. Woe is me and and a and having a
[1:16:32] pity party." It means that Lord, I my
[1:16:36] ways are not your ways. My thoughts are
[1:16:38] not your thoughts. Amen. God, I just
[1:16:42] can't quite make it. I I just can't
[1:16:44] quite meet uh Amen. your approval. I
[1:16:47] just at your word, it just seems I fall
[1:16:50] short. But God, if you'll give me grace,
[1:16:53] God, if you'll give me power. God, if
[1:16:55] you'll raise me up. Oh, can you say
[1:16:57] amen? God, I'm struggling with my
[1:16:59] brother. God, I'm struggling with my
[1:17:01] mama. God, I'm struggling. But if you'll
[1:17:04] give me grace, Lord, here I am. I'm take
[1:17:08] I want you to take all pride. I want you
[1:17:11] to take off uh anger. I want you to take
[1:17:13] all malice. I want you to take
[1:17:15] everything from me as I fall before you
[1:17:19] in humility. I need access to your
[1:17:23] grace.
[1:17:28] Can you say amen?
[1:17:30] What does God think about my
[1:17:34] attitude or my approach to his
[1:17:37] grace? What does God think about your
[1:17:39] attitude and approach? Because grace has
[1:17:43] been given.
[1:17:45] We got a whole We got a whole bunch of
[1:17:47] Bible talking about
[1:17:49] predestination and
[1:17:51] election and what Christ has done for
[1:17:54] you. We got a whole Bible talking about
[1:17:56] there's going to be an elect that would
[1:17:58] be called out of Babylon. Amen. By this
[1:18:01] seventh angel messenger. Oh, we got a
[1:18:04] whole lot of Bible. Right.
[1:18:07] But what's my attitude toward that
[1:18:10] grace? Amen. You see, your approach is
[1:18:15] very important. Your
[1:18:17] attitude. What What is What is my
[1:18:21] attitude? What is my attitude?
[1:18:24] toward this unlimited,
[1:18:28] bountiful,
[1:18:30] unfailing
[1:18:32] grace. Would you think that a woe is me
[1:18:37] attitude would be the
[1:18:40] approach? Would you think a bitter heart
[1:18:44] would be the right
[1:18:46] approach when God has come and said
[1:18:51] specifically that you are mine elect and
[1:18:53] I've loved you before the foundation of
[1:18:56] the world and and he's expressed what
[1:18:58] his grace
[1:19:00] is. What what what what
[1:19:03] attitude would be the right
[1:19:07] attitude? I I know I know when I if I've
[1:19:11] offered something to my
[1:19:15] sons or my
[1:19:18] daughters,
[1:19:20] grandchildren, and I and I and I offer
[1:19:22] and then and then I and then I hear as I
[1:19:24] as they as they come back and you know
[1:19:28] they they they've not they've not taken
[1:19:29] me up on the deal and well, we just
[1:19:32] don't. No, no, I I just won't do it. I
[1:19:37] just
[1:19:39] hallelujah. When I get up and give my
[1:19:42] chair to one of my girls, they better
[1:19:45] take my
[1:19:47] chair because that is
[1:19:49] grace. I am giving. I am getting up out
[1:19:53] of my chair because I want one of my
[1:19:56] girls to sit in it. Right now, now
[1:20:01] they're being gracious back to me,
[1:20:03] saying, "Well, but you're back and
[1:20:04] you're this and no. No, no, no, no, no,
[1:20:07] no, no, no, no. And when we come to
[1:20:11] God and God has extended his grace. Oh,
[1:20:17] glory to
[1:20:18] God. When the golden scepter has been
[1:20:22] has been put before you and said, "I'll
[1:20:25] give you up to half the kingdom." And
[1:20:28] you ask for a
[1:20:30] Twinkie. I'll give you half the kingdom.
[1:20:34] Amen. and and you're saying, "Ah, well,
[1:20:36] I I'm just not worthy. I just don't
[1:20:40] know." Your stinking attitude is a
[1:20:43] stench in the nostrils of God. It is
[1:20:46] grace and not your merit.
[1:20:53] It is
[1:20:56] grace. If you think you being
[1:21:02] good is going to make God love you
[1:21:06] more, you don't know salvation yet.
[1:21:13] But it's the
[1:21:17] humble that says, "I'm not using my
[1:21:19] merits." Oh, but I go to church and so I
[1:21:21] don't care. I I do this. I got I and and
[1:21:24] you're justifying the things in your
[1:21:26] life that grace has come to give you
[1:21:29] power over and you are and you're using
[1:21:31] your works. Well, well, but I but I but
[1:21:35] I it stinks.
[1:21:39] But the one that has nothing to
[1:21:43] offer than the one that
[1:21:46] says thank you.
[1:21:51] If you've got the golden scepter in your
[1:21:54] hand. Oh, glory to God. Oh, glory to
[1:21:58] God. You remember the story that Brother
[1:21:59] Bradom talks about the messenger that
[1:22:01] had to take the message. He talks about
[1:22:03] it was it was a story back in the in the
[1:22:06] old days and the king needed needed to
[1:22:08] run take the messenger take take a
[1:22:10] message uh uh out to a general. Amen.
[1:22:14] And he and he hands him he hands him the
[1:22:17] message but then he stops. He says,
[1:22:19] "Hey, come back
[1:22:21] here. Take my golden
[1:22:23] scepter. And if anyone stops you, just
[1:22:27] show them the
[1:22:29] scepter." Any anyone says, "I don't just
[1:22:32] show them the scepter." I I I say here
[1:22:36] today, if God's given you this message,
[1:22:38] he's given you the golden
[1:22:40] scepter. And the enemy wants to say,
[1:22:42] "Well, you're not worthy."
[1:22:44] Just Hallelujah. Amen. Well, well, but
[1:22:48] you you don't belong. Just show them the
[1:22:50] scepter. Amen. When when when it looks
[1:22:52] like everything is against you, just
[1:22:55] show them that scepter. Don't you stop.
[1:22:58] You've got the king's message. Oh,
[1:23:01] hallelujah. Oh, but you're too young.
[1:23:03] Just show them the scepter. Oh, you're
[1:23:05] too old. Just show them the scepter. Oh,
[1:23:07] you've sinned too much. Just show them
[1:23:09] the golden scepter. It is God's word
[1:23:13] given to you by divine grace in this
[1:23:16] day.
[1:23:23] Attitudes. Attitudes mean
[1:23:26] everything because attitudes are a
[1:23:29] reflection of your faith. As brother
[1:23:31] Brandham was saying, you can't you can't
[1:23:34] have fear to God and not have
[1:23:37] faith. And you can't say you have faith
[1:23:41] that you have faith and you don't fear
[1:23:44] God. Faith sees what God has, shows the
[1:23:49] unlimited resources he has, and it
[1:23:51] really shines a light on your
[1:23:54] inabilities.
[1:23:56] Well, praise the Lord. Brother Brandham
[1:23:59] says it's your attitude of
[1:24:00] reproach, how you approach anything. If
[1:24:04] you come like on the gift here, you've
[1:24:07] got to approach the gift in the right
[1:24:10] way. Another place he says, I wish you'd
[1:24:12] be reverent while I'm
[1:24:13] praying. It's not an excitable matter.
[1:24:17] It's reverent. We must approach God with
[1:24:20] a true sincere heart. Just as reverent
[1:24:24] as we can be. Well, praise the
[1:24:27] Lord. How? Well, hallelujah.
[1:24:30] Faith is the
[1:24:34] access to bountiful
[1:24:37] grace. Amen. Now, Brother Brenamman
[1:24:41] says, "What what is it?" God catches us
[1:24:44] and we tried to lead him. Let him lead.
[1:24:48] He knows the way. He has traveled the
[1:24:51] road. He made the road. We don't know
[1:24:54] the road. So why do we try to reason
[1:24:58] these things out?
[1:25:00] Let us submit ourselves to him and say,
[1:25:05] "Lord, you lead me and I'll
[1:25:10] follow." It's your grace. It's your
[1:25:13] grace that's put me on the road. I don't
[1:25:15] know the road. You know the road. You
[1:25:18] made the road. You know how You know
[1:25:21] where my destiny is. You know what
[1:25:24] you've got. You know how to get me
[1:25:26] there. Well, somebody shout hallelujah.
[1:25:29] I said, God knows your road. God knows
[1:25:34] where you're going to end. Amen. God,
[1:25:37] let me lead. Let me follow you. He says,
[1:25:41] "How about your Lord? Oh, you want to be
[1:25:44] saved. You don't want to go to the
[1:25:46] devil's hell, but you don't want to
[1:25:48] receive him as your Lord. Lord is ruler.
[1:25:52] Lord takes over all you. You want to
[1:25:55] have your own little private life. You
[1:25:58] want to live the Christian life the way
[1:25:59] you want to. You don't want to live it
[1:26:02] the way he wants you to. Let him come
[1:26:04] into your heart and say, "Oh, I I I've
[1:26:07] let you in my heart, Jesus, as as my
[1:26:09] savior." Yes, but but I I I I've never
[1:26:12] let you take control cuz I wanted to act
[1:26:15] a little this way. I want to be modern.
[1:26:18] Oh, he ain't your Lord yet. Help us,
[1:26:20] Presley. And Godfrey spirit has still
[1:26:22] got a hold of you. The devil. Sure.
[1:26:25] Won't you come where Christ is
[1:26:29] moving? See his spirit. There is where
[1:26:34] the grace is.
[1:26:38] Oh, glory to
[1:26:40] God.
[1:26:41] Access. Access. The door that shuts, the
[1:26:45] door that opens. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:26:47] The prophet of God would also say, he
[1:26:50] says, "The thrill, the blessedness of
[1:26:52] knowing the risen Lord Jesus stands in
[1:26:55] our midst should send every soul into
[1:26:58] the heights beyond anything in this
[1:27:00] world could thrill. It should do
[1:27:02] something to you. It should take your
[1:27:04] faith to you would open up every door of
[1:27:07] faith, everything else, and say, "Lord,
[1:27:10] take full possession of me now. Take me
[1:27:13] into your caring here. Come into my
[1:27:16] heart. Take my selfishness away. Take my
[1:27:18] misunderstandings away. Take my doubts
[1:27:21] away. Open my eyes, Lord, and let me
[1:27:24] see. Take all of me and be my Lord.
[1:27:26] Until the church does that, we are
[1:27:29] walking in blindness. And Jesus is
[1:27:31] knocking at the door and we're leaving
[1:27:34] him
[1:27:36] outside.
[1:27:37] Grace knocking. Can you say
[1:27:40] amen? He says, "Many professed
[1:27:42] Christians don't want to open that door
[1:27:43] of faith. Now you say, 'Lord, you come
[1:27:47] in. That's right, but I don't believe
[1:27:49] that all the Bible is right. I will take
[1:27:52] my church, what my church says, but I
[1:27:54] won't take the rest of it, how is your
[1:27:56] Lord ever going to bless you then? How
[1:27:59] can he be your Lord and healer if he
[1:28:01] can't get your door of faith open? If he
[1:28:04] can if if he can come in and you'll
[1:28:07] welcome him, he'll open that door and
[1:28:10] he'll walk in to that faith of yours. He
[1:28:13] will suck with you in that door of
[1:28:16] faith. Someone shout hallelujah.
[1:28:19] Amen. Another place. If I've got the
[1:28:21] faith, the works is finished. If he can
[1:28:24] open that door and come in and give me
[1:28:27] the faith in my heart, it's finished.
[1:28:29] When I can really believe him. Amen.
[1:28:31] Another place. Oh, blessed be his name.
[1:28:34] You don't have let him come in. Open
[1:28:36] that door of faith. When he come, when
[1:28:38] he says anything, it's the truth. Amen.
[1:28:41] When his promise is to you, that's the
[1:28:44] substance. When the faith anchors to
[1:28:46] know that God cannot lie, it is settled.
[1:28:50] Santa, can I hear an amen?
[1:28:53] Yes. That faith, faith is the access to
[1:28:57] that supernatural grace. Grace has been
[1:29:04] extended. Oh, glory to God. I'm here
[1:29:06] this morning because of grace.
[1:29:09] You're here this morning because of
[1:29:11] grace. Now, Lord, let me open the door.
[1:29:15] Let me open that door of faith, brother.
[1:29:18] There is there is no telling what where
[1:29:20] I'm going and how I'm getting there
[1:29:22] because grace faith is going to give me
[1:29:26] access. Faith isn't going to be shut up.
[1:29:29] You say, "Amen. I need another
[1:29:31] scripture." The Bible says, Amen. There
[1:29:32] in Romans, faith where Galatians, faith
[1:29:35] was once shut up. Amen. We were shut up
[1:29:39] unto faith. Amen. Kept underneath the
[1:29:42] law of the dos and don'ts. Amen. But
[1:29:45] when faith came, when faith came, grace
[1:29:48] was exhibited to us. Can you say amen?
[1:29:51] Through faith. Through faith. Amen. The
[1:29:53] patriarchs seen the provisions of grace.
[1:29:56] It had to be. Amen. It was able. It was
[1:30:00] by faith that Abel could see God's
[1:30:04] provided grace. It was by faith Abel
[1:30:07] could see that grace had provided a
[1:30:10] lamb. Therefore, Abel could walk by
[1:30:15] faith and offer a lamb even though he
[1:30:19] was never taught it. Even though he
[1:30:21] never learned it in school. Amen. He
[1:30:23] knew there was coming a Oh, glory to
[1:30:26] God. By faith, he was ushered. Amen. He
[1:30:31] was given access into that grace.
[1:30:37] [Music]
[1:30:38] Can you say
[1:30:39] amen?
[1:30:41] Amen.
[1:30:43] Noah was given the knowhow to escape the
[1:30:46] coming judgments. Amen. This is when the
[1:30:49] fear of God come upon Noah, God called
[1:30:52] him by grace and saved him and his house
[1:30:55] because he it was grace that did it. But
[1:30:58] not because Noah was a big handsome man
[1:31:01] than all the rest of them. Not because
[1:31:03] Noah went to the best church there is in
[1:31:06] the country. Not because he belonged to
[1:31:08] the best organization. Not because he
[1:31:10] could dress better. Not because he had
[1:31:12] more money. Not because he was a special
[1:31:14] person. But because of the grace of God.
[1:31:21] It was because of the grace of God that
[1:31:24] God saved Noah. Grace saved Noah. Not
[1:31:28] his works, but his grace and also his
[1:31:30] family. Well, praise the name of the
[1:31:33] Lord. Oh my. Noah didn't have all He
[1:31:37] didn't have all of the the the the ins
[1:31:39] and outs. He didn't have all the
[1:31:41] answers. He didn't have all of these
[1:31:43] things. That is very true. Amen. But he
[1:31:46] was just walking in the grace. Amen.
[1:31:48] God, thank you for the grace. I'm going
[1:31:49] to believe you for the grace. I'm going
[1:31:51] to get out. The Bible says he moved with
[1:31:54] fear. Amen. He built an ark. He done
[1:31:57] those things. Why? Because faith says
[1:31:59] God is going to keep his word. Faith,
[1:32:02] amen, open it up and give me access into
[1:32:05] that grace. Do you realize that only
[1:32:07] eight people out of billions were saved,
[1:32:10] amen, on that boat? It was because God
[1:32:13] took, Amen, a little farmer by the name
[1:32:16] of Noah and says, "I'm going to give you
[1:32:19] access. I'm going to give you grace. I'm
[1:32:23] going to show you mercy. I'm going Well,
[1:32:26] not because he's good. Not because he's
[1:32:28] bad, but because God favored him.
[1:32:40] You see, it's it's the
[1:32:45] heart. It's not how often you get it
[1:32:49] right and how often you get it wrong.
[1:32:56] It's the
[1:32:57] cry that is saying,
[1:33:00] "Lord, I want access to that power to
[1:33:03] live an overcoming
[1:33:05] life." The one that says, "I'm
[1:33:09] fine." has shut the
[1:33:11] door. The one who says, "Well, ain't
[1:33:15] going to be no one tell me I can't smoke
[1:33:17] cigarettes, or no one going to tell me
[1:33:19] to watch my attitude, or no one's going
[1:33:21] to tell me that. Hallelujah. You've shut
[1:33:24] the door.
[1:33:28] King Saul shut the door.
[1:33:35] He
[1:33:37] sinned. And when the prophet came up and
[1:33:40] says, "What is the loing and what is the
[1:33:42] bleeding of the sheep? What what do you
[1:33:46] have here?"
[1:33:48] He goes, "H, well, I know the Lord said,
[1:33:51] but I was thinking this would make
[1:33:53] wonderful
[1:33:55] sacrifice." And God says, "Because you
[1:33:59] have disobeyed, I'm taking the kingdom
[1:34:02] from you." Instead of him falling on his
[1:34:06] face, grabbing the foot of the prophet
[1:34:08] and begging for access into grace,
[1:34:18] He said,
[1:34:20] "Really? I'm asking you to do one thing
[1:34:23] with me,
[1:34:25] prophet Samuel, go with me before the
[1:34:28] people to worship and honor me there
[1:34:32] before
[1:34:34] them." Samuel says, "My honor will do
[1:34:37] nothing to you."
[1:34:39] He was demanding the preacher to honor
[1:34:43] him, the prophet to honor him despite
[1:34:47] his wrong. There was nothing saying I
[1:34:49] have sinned. I am wrong.
[1:34:54] He lost the kingdom. The next
[1:34:57] kingdom or the next king was king
[1:35:01] David and grace was given to David.
[1:35:06] Grace brought him from the
[1:35:09] sheepfold. Grace gave him
[1:35:13] favor.
[1:35:17] Grace Grace was all around him. He
[1:35:21] wasn't head and shoulders tall. He was a
[1:35:23] little fella. He was
[1:35:26] ruddy. David was the least of his
[1:35:30] brethren. His father seen no honor in
[1:35:34] him.
[1:35:36] Oh,
[1:35:37] glory. As he was out there in the
[1:35:40] shepherd or out there in the field,
[1:35:43] there he
[1:35:44] was all alone. But grace had brought him
[1:35:47] into a into a realm with
[1:35:50] God. He didn't have friends. He didn't
[1:35:52] have anything. But grace, Amen. Faith
[1:35:55] had brought him into this grace. And he
[1:35:58] would come and write songs and sing
[1:36:00] songs to God. The grace was upon him.
[1:36:03] power, the anointing. Oh, you don't have
[1:36:05] to have you don't have to belong in the
[1:36:08] who's who. You don't have to Amen. to
[1:36:11] have great friends in high places. You
[1:36:14] don't have to have your name on
[1:36:16] marquees. All you need is grace. All it
[1:36:19] takes is a humble heart. Oh, come on. If
[1:36:23] a proud heart took the kingdom away, a
[1:36:26] humble heart will usher you in. If a
[1:36:29] proud spirit, amen, will keep the the
[1:36:32] heart of God and the power of God away,
[1:36:35] then the anointing of a sweet and humble
[1:36:38] and contrite heart will bring the
[1:36:42] kingdom near you.
[1:36:47] David
[1:36:49] very
[1:36:51] humbled. He would sing songs to
[1:36:55] him, living in grace.
[1:36:58] Oh my lion would come. He's already
[1:37:02] there. He didn't have to go pray. He
[1:37:05] didn't have to get prayed through. He
[1:37:06] just walked right. He took off after him
[1:37:08] because he was living in that world with
[1:37:10] God. He wouldn't live in infurity
[1:37:13] complexes. He he he although he had
[1:37:15] plenty of them there, but he had to
[1:37:17] choose. He had to choose. His faith had
[1:37:20] to be anchored in that divine one who
[1:37:23] had called him and placed that anointing
[1:37:25] upon his life. He had to make that
[1:37:32] choice. Yes, he was despised of his
[1:37:35] brethren. Yes, his daddy just put him
[1:37:38] out there to take care of the sheep. But
[1:37:41] God seen something within him and gave
[1:37:44] him the
[1:37:46] unmmerited favor.
[1:37:50] David slew the
[1:37:52] lion. Another time he slew the
[1:37:56] bear. Another time he slew the
[1:37:58] Goliath. His brother saying, "Oh, don't
[1:38:01] be the naughty boy you are. Go on back
[1:38:02] to those
[1:38:04] sheep." He says, "Listen, that's an
[1:38:07] uncircumcised Philistine that's making
[1:38:08] fun of my God." Hallelujah. I can fight
[1:38:12] him. I can fight him. Grace. Living in
[1:38:17] grace.
[1:38:19] The Bible says that David was a man
[1:38:22] after God's very own
[1:38:28] heart. But David was also
[1:38:36] one that knew what it was to blow it
[1:38:40] big.
[1:38:42] David was also one that knew what it
[1:38:49] was to look out the roof off the roof
[1:38:52] and see
[1:38:53] it a woman
[1:38:58] bathing and I can't remember
[1:39:02] the the man he was a proelite of
[1:39:05] Israel
[1:39:07] man he loved
[1:39:10] David. He had been expelled from the
[1:39:12] kingdom of D of
[1:39:15] Saul. He was living off in another
[1:39:17] country because of Saul's
[1:39:22] tyranny to the indebted one. Uriah.
[1:39:25] Yeah, I think it was Uriah. What was it?
[1:39:28] I can't remember what what he what
[1:39:31] nationality he was.
[1:39:33] But when he had heard that
[1:39:36] David when he had heard that
[1:39:39] David was living in the grace and the
[1:39:42] power of God was with David, he was one
[1:39:45] of those guys. Uriah was one of those
[1:39:46] guys that fled to the cave with David.
[1:39:49] He knew that David was going to come
[1:39:50] into power. Uriah was with
[1:39:54] David. David, he loved David.
[1:39:59] But that was his wife that David had
[1:40:01] committed adultery
[1:40:03] with and and then when David couldn't
[1:40:06] come he took him off the battlefield and
[1:40:08] he and he says go go home and spend some
[1:40:10] time with your wife and he wouldn't do
[1:40:12] it. He he slept out there on the palace
[1:40:15] in front of the palace and wouldn't even
[1:40:16] go home to his wife and said I've got
[1:40:18] men out there. I've got my brethren out
[1:40:20] there fighting for the king. I I can't
[1:40:22] go
[1:40:23] in. David couldn't get him to do it. He
[1:40:26] was that kind of a man. He was a good
[1:40:28] man.
[1:40:30] Then David says, "All
[1:40:32] right." Writes a letter telling Joab to
[1:40:36] take him out there. Put him right out
[1:40:38] there in the front of the right right
[1:40:40] out there in on the front lines. And in
[1:40:43] the thick of the battle, everybody
[1:40:45] retrieve. Everyone go back. Don't give
[1:40:49] him Don't Don't Don't let Uriah know.
[1:40:54] Uriah was
[1:40:56] killed by David
[1:41:03] when the prophet comes up and tells him
[1:41:06] there's David. What do you think about
[1:41:08] the man who had many use or many many
[1:41:12] sheep? He had many sheep but his
[1:41:15] neighbor only had one little ulam. He
[1:41:17] loved the little ulam. The ulam even
[1:41:20] slept in the house with him. He He He
[1:41:23] only had one, but he loved
[1:41:25] it. Indignation. David says, "The man
[1:41:28] shall
[1:41:29] die and he shall
[1:41:33] repay. This shall be
[1:41:37] done." The judgment was
[1:41:42] pronounced. And when when the prophet
[1:41:46] looked at him and said, "David, you're
[1:41:49] the man.
[1:41:56] Immediately David ripped off his
[1:41:59] clothes and said, "My Lord, I have
[1:42:02] sinned against
[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:08] God." What did God
[1:42:12] do? God says, "You shall not
[1:42:15] die, but you will pay for your sin.
[1:42:21] in his
[1:42:23] approach into this grace. Are you
[1:42:27] hearing
[1:42:28] me? Another time when when when when he
[1:42:32] had had had numbered Israel instead of
[1:42:35] the doing it the and went against the
[1:42:37] the the decree of God and judgment
[1:42:40] struck and they come up and and and and
[1:42:43] the prophet comes up to him again and he
[1:42:45] says, "You're going to have a choice.
[1:42:47] either either. Amen. You're you're
[1:42:49] you're you're going to pay the penalty.
[1:42:52] Amen. And he and he says you're Amen.
[1:42:55] You you're you know you're you're going
[1:42:57] to be subject to this king or you could
[1:42:59] have this or or you could have Amen. or
[1:43:02] you could have this. And David says, "I
[1:43:04] don't know how to answer. Just let me
[1:43:07] fall into the hands of the Almighty God.
[1:43:12] Let him deal with me. Men will not be
[1:43:15] merciful." But he says, "But God will be
[1:43:19] merciful unto me." Are you hearing me?
[1:43:22] It was
[1:43:23] grace. It was grace. He knew what that
[1:43:27] grace was. Oh church of the living God,
[1:43:30] I know what grace is. I know what it is
[1:43:33] to fail. I know what it is to falter. I
[1:43:36] know what it is to beg for mercy. But I
[1:43:40] also know what it is to find grace. to
[1:43:45] find that unlimited supply of God's
[1:43:48] divine favor in my life.
[1:44:00] Says, "All
[1:44:02] right, all
[1:44:04] right." And a plague
[1:44:06] started and tens of thousands are dying.
[1:44:13] He's coming before
[1:44:15] God. He tells the prophet, "Don't let
[1:44:18] these people die for my sin." What can I
[1:44:22] do? What can I do to appease God? You
[1:44:26] see, his heart was in humility. His
[1:44:28] heart was in it was brokenness. And God,
[1:44:32] the prophet told him, he says, "Go amen.
[1:44:35] uh to to to the to to the uh uh uh
[1:44:39] hallelujah the threshing floor of of of
[1:44:42] Uranus I think is what his name was.
[1:44:44] Amen. He says go and buy the place and
[1:44:48] offer a sacrifice unto God. Amen. Or he
[1:44:52] says just go up there to to offer
[1:44:54] sacrifice. David G takes up his lambs.
[1:44:57] Amen. He's in a hurry. People are dying.
[1:44:59] They're dying by the thousands and he's
[1:45:02] running up there to that place. Amen.
[1:45:05] And he says, he gets to Uranus and he
[1:45:07] says, "Amen. Let me buy this place to
[1:45:10] offer." And the man said, "Oh no." Amen.
[1:45:12] I'll give it to my king. You don't have
[1:45:14] to buy it. He says, "I will not offer
[1:45:17] anything unto my God." Amen. That I have
[1:45:21] not purchased. I will give God my all.
[1:45:26] Can you say amen? He says, "If I don't
[1:45:29] give it, if I don't give everything I've
[1:45:31] got," Amen. What did he do? He bought
[1:45:34] the place and there he offered the
[1:45:37] sacrifice and God accepted that
[1:45:40] sacrifice
[1:45:44] and the plan was
[1:45:49] stayed. God says I will
[1:45:52] never forget
[1:45:55] David. I will never take my
[1:46:00] mercies from David.
[1:46:06] That's my
[1:46:07] grace. I've called
[1:46:10] David without
[1:46:13] merit. I've called
[1:46:16] David without ability. I've raised him
[1:46:20] up. And though he
[1:46:23] fail, I will not surely leave
[1:46:29] David.
[1:46:33] Our approach under
[1:46:37] grace, our approach, our approach is
[1:46:40] everything. Are are you hearing me? Oh,
[1:46:43] we could go through we could go through
[1:46:44] time after time. Amen. David David God
[1:46:48] time after time have to go back and and
[1:46:51] bring and
[1:46:52] and oh how it was. But when God looks at
[1:46:55] David, you know what? God says Jesus is
[1:46:58] going to sit on the throne of David.
[1:47:02] Jesus is go well praise the name of the
[1:47:04] Lord. Can you see? Amen. Amen. When you
[1:47:08] think of Abraham, he brother Brandon
[1:47:11] says we could Amen. He says he says
[1:47:14] here's another character where God's
[1:47:16] grace was extended. Many of them, but
[1:47:19] we'll just speak of a few. Abraham,
[1:47:21] Abraham, no special man, come down from
[1:47:24] the tower of Babel, perhaps come out of
[1:47:26] an adulter bunch, idolatr bunch, his
[1:47:29] father, come down to the land of Shinar
[1:47:32] down there to dwell in the city of
[1:47:35] U. And while he was there, God spoke to
[1:47:39] him by grace, not because he was
[1:47:41] different, not because he was a better
[1:47:43] man, but by grace, God called him.
[1:47:47] God clearly makes that known. Oh,
[1:47:50] Abraham, how Abraham tested God's
[1:47:53] patience and told him, Abraham, stay in
[1:47:55] this land and don't you go out of it.
[1:47:57] But as soon as the famine hit, Abraham
[1:47:59] ran. Abraham spoke of us. God took Abram
[1:48:04] by grace and saved him. And that's how
[1:48:06] he takes you is by grace. How how do you
[1:48:09] Oh, how you do test his
[1:48:12] patience. He We test his patience. Today
[1:48:15] we're up and tomorrow we're down. One
[1:48:17] day we believe, the next day we're
[1:48:19] wandering. Today we're a Methodist.
[1:48:20] Tomorrow we're a Baptist. Today we we
[1:48:23] believe in divine healing. Tomorrow the
[1:48:25] tummy ache comes. And we don't know
[1:48:26] whether we believe it or not. Amen. Yet
[1:48:29] in the midst of it all, God wants to
[1:48:30] wants us to stay put. But he saves us
[1:48:33] anyhow. If if it wasn't the grace of
[1:48:35] God, we'd all be gone. Sure, God gives
[1:48:37] us gives us by his saves us by his
[1:48:40] grace. Abraham was supposed to stay in
[1:48:43] that land. He went down in the
[1:48:45] Chaldanss, not not to the Philistines
[1:48:48] and went went down there to sojourn to
[1:48:50] get out of the famine and things uh was
[1:48:53] a little hard up in his country. So he
[1:48:55] went down there to sojourn down there
[1:48:57] with them. Done exactly what God told
[1:48:59] him not to do. But yet the grace
[1:49:01] appeared to him and kept Pharaoh the
[1:49:03] king from taking his wife. It was the
[1:49:06] grace of God when Abraham said as my
[1:49:08] sister and lied about it. But yet the
[1:49:10] grace of God held him because he
[1:49:12] repented. He was willing to repent. And
[1:49:15] anybody that is willing to repent, the
[1:49:18] grace of God still goes for you. The
[1:49:20] grace of God is searching for you. Amen.
[1:49:22] That goes for you backsliders this
[1:49:24] morning. The grace of God is still
[1:49:26] looking for you. If you'll just repent,
[1:49:29] God's grace is sufficient. How he he how
[1:49:33] he took good old Abraham and brought him
[1:49:35] back. Remember, Abraham was not saved by
[1:49:37] his works. He was saved by grace.
[1:49:40] Abraham was saved by faith. Amen. which
[1:49:43] is grace. And God saved Abraham because
[1:49:46] of his grace, not because of his
[1:49:49] behavior. He saved him because of his
[1:49:51] grace. Oh, how good. He was saved by
[1:49:54] grace.
[1:49:58] Well, we could go through Well, we could
[1:50:00] go
[1:50:01] through Old Testament, New Testament,
[1:50:04] how we could go through our
[1:50:09] life or
[1:50:12] approach, help my
[1:50:14] approach. How am I to approach this
[1:50:18] grace? Am I to become a stuff shirt and
[1:50:21] get satisfied with what I am after I've
[1:50:23] served the Lord for five years? Oh, I
[1:50:25] wouldn't that way. I wouldn't I I I I
[1:50:27] was I was willing to do anything when I
[1:50:29] first came to the Lord. But
[1:50:32] today, got my own
[1:50:37] way. Bastardborn sons have no
[1:50:44] resolve for their father.
[1:50:49] But a son of the
[1:50:50] kingdom has one desire and that is the
[1:50:54] father's
[1:51:00] will. It is the bastardborn
[1:51:05] sons that'll go to works. I do this and
[1:51:09] this and this and this.
[1:51:18] I've got this on my resume. I've got
[1:51:21] that on my
[1:51:24] resume. But it is sons who wants the
[1:51:28] heart of God to be their everything.
[1:51:35] It's the sons that are
[1:51:37] bleeding, bleeding to please the will of
[1:51:42] God.
[1:51:46] It's the sons of
[1:51:50] God who do
[1:51:53] nothing except the
[1:51:56] father. And when they
[1:52:00] fail, it's a
[1:52:02] heart of
[1:52:06] humility. And
[1:52:08] Lord, never take your grace from
[1:52:13] Let your
[1:52:20] grace help
[1:52:22] me. Oh, but
[1:52:25] I but I'm the song
[1:52:28] leader. Has nothing to do with you and
[1:52:31] God. I'm the
[1:52:34] musician. Can't put that on your me
[1:52:39] resume. I'm the pastor.
[1:52:43] equals a big
[1:52:45] zero. God says, the apostle Paul says,
[1:52:49] after you have done done the will of
[1:52:54] God, then consider yourselves as
[1:53:00] unworth. After you've done
[1:53:04] it, consider yourself a big zero.
[1:53:11] for it is
[1:53:14] grace. I don't want God to start putting
[1:53:18] measurements on me. I don't want I don't
[1:53:21] want to come up to God and say I can
[1:53:22] sing and I can preach and I can do this
[1:53:24] and
[1:53:26] I there
[1:53:27] [Music]
[1:53:29] ain't I'm still I I'm still in the
[1:53:31] subzero. I'm still in the negatives. I
[1:53:34] have nothing I could offer. Are are
[1:53:36] y'all understanding what I'm saying? But
[1:53:39] access to this grace comes by faith. And
[1:53:43] brother Bradam says that faith is a
[1:53:45] fear. It's a reverence. It's a it's a
[1:53:48] it's an honor. I have stepped into a
[1:53:51] realm with
[1:53:53] God. I'm in this realm. God's invited me
[1:53:57] into it.
[1:54:01] Oh, how I love
[1:54:03] it. Can you say amen?
[1:54:11] Now, as I get ready
[1:54:13] to
[1:54:21] close
[1:54:22] this
[1:54:25] incredible,
[1:54:29] vast, as brother Brandon would say,
[1:54:32] arcade that you've been invited into. He
[1:54:35] says it's like he called it an
[1:54:37] arcade. I don't know if you'd call it an
[1:54:40] arcade
[1:54:41] today.
[1:54:44] Um, but it's it's a great he called it a
[1:54:48] great arcade. It may still be called
[1:54:51] that. I
[1:54:52] just I'm I'm just living pony. Amen.
[1:54:56] But where
[1:54:58] where you've been given this access,
[1:55:01] you've been the doors been opened up and
[1:55:03] you've been given this access into this
[1:55:06] arcade and
[1:55:08] everything I think of arcades as
[1:55:11] games, but everything of God's
[1:55:15] blessings is in it.
[1:55:18] Everything that God
[1:55:22] owns is in that supply house.
[1:55:28] He says, "For
[1:55:30] you to walk in through the door and say,
[1:55:38] "Oh, I don't know. I don't know if I
[1:55:41] belong here. I don't know. I don't know
[1:55:45] if I should ask for healing."
[1:55:48] Brother Brandham says, "If you've been
[1:55:50] given access into it," he says, "I would
[1:55:55] get a ladder. I would start climbing. I
[1:55:59] would see what all is on those shelves
[1:56:02] because whatever he has is
[1:56:08] mine because I've been
[1:56:11] given access."
[1:56:17] Well, praise the Lord.
[1:56:19] Oh, praise the
[1:56:22] Lord. After your ups, downs, ins outs,
[1:56:27] if the grace of God's been extended to
[1:56:29] you, it's the same thing. It's the same
[1:56:31] thing as the golden
[1:56:35] sector. Everything God's owns is in this
[1:56:38] storehouse. And he says it's
[1:56:41] yours. Healing is yours.
[1:56:45] Miracles are
[1:56:46] yours. Salvation is
[1:56:49] yours. Victory is yours.
[1:56:53] God's even got wives out there for you
[1:56:55] single ones. Got boy or got got got got
[1:56:58] got got got got got got got got got got
[1:56:58] got got got got got got got got got got
[1:56:58] got got got got got got got got got got
[1:56:58] got got got got got got got got h h h h
[1:56:58] h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h
[1:56:58] h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h out
[1:56:58] there. He's got he's got all of that all
[1:57:00] taken care of. God's got everything in
[1:57:02] his
[1:57:04] will. Well, pray.
[1:57:07] I don't want to do Amen, Austin. Amen.
[1:57:11] I don't want to I I don't I don't want
[1:57:12] to just go I don't want to just go uh uh
[1:57:15] just just part way. I don't want to just
[1:57:17] to accept except just a a little bit. I
[1:57:20] I just want to have
[1:57:23] confidence. I know my daddy I was raised
[1:57:26] poor and I know my daddy was in the
[1:57:29] ministry and he chose he chose the
[1:57:33] ministry. My dad was talented. He could
[1:57:35] he could lay rock. He could My dad's a
[1:57:37] carpenter. He could do anything.
[1:57:40] But he chose to work there at the church
[1:57:44] on a free will offering
[1:57:46] basis. He
[1:57:49] chose.
[1:57:52] Amen. We lived without electricity. A
[1:57:54] lot of times we lived without we we did.
[1:57:56] We we live we we live pretty
[1:58:00] poor. That's the way he chose. He taught
[1:58:03] us
[1:58:04] boys to give it all to God.
[1:58:09] And I don't regret it. I don't regret
[1:58:11] any of I don't regret any of my raising.
[1:58:13] Not at all. It was a great heritage that
[1:58:17] God gave me through my mom and dad.
[1:58:23] But my mama and daddy being
[1:58:27] poor in the natural and because of that
[1:58:31] despised by some in the church and just
[1:58:33] sort of you know you have that
[1:58:38] everywhere and though they had that
[1:58:41] that you know just just fighting the
[1:58:44] critical spirit from different ones.
[1:58:47] Hey, we worked in the church. We
[1:58:50] labored. You
[1:58:52] know, they could say what they want to
[1:58:54] about dad and dad's family. Well, anyone
[1:58:58] else could have jumped in and worked too
[1:58:59] if they wanted
[1:59:01] to. When given the opportunity, they
[1:59:03] wouldn't. So, it all came back upon us.
[1:59:06] So, the you know, I dad and mom,
[1:59:10] they they had their hands in everything.
[1:59:13] Dad, dad was principal, associate
[1:59:16] pastor, he was the he was he was he was
[1:59:19] the head of the music. He was the uh mom
[1:59:23] was school teacher. I mean he we I mean
[1:59:26] what dad done the
[1:59:30] counseling you
[1:59:36] know but what I found in my
[1:59:40] raising is dad didn't allow that complex
[1:59:45] or to build a comp being poor did he he
[1:59:50] did not allow being poor to to build a
[1:59:53] complex around
[1:59:56] him being
[1:59:59] poor, he just felt that was the will of
[2:00:01] the Lord for him to do and
[2:00:06] whatever. But being poor and despised by
[2:00:11] a
[2:00:13] few did not
[2:00:15] hamper his relationship with the
[2:00:22] Lord.
[2:00:24] Our family saw miracle
[2:00:29] after miracle.
[2:00:32] We We would get into prayer. Mom and dad
[2:00:33] when they prayed, they they didn't pray
[2:00:35] this little lay me down to sleep prayers
[2:00:37] like we prayed with our children.
[2:00:38] Hallelujah. We'd Amen. We'd about fall
[2:00:42] we'd about fall asleep on the side of
[2:00:45] the bed. Well, we did fall asleep on the
[2:00:46] side of bed many of times waiting on mom
[2:00:50] and dad to get out of our room so we
[2:00:52] could go to sleep. Amen. And uh uh but
[2:00:55] we we we'd be there. They'd be a
[2:00:58] praying and and you know our car was
[2:01:02] open. Then dad rises up. Dad just
[2:01:04] praying and then all of a sudden he
[2:01:05] says, "There'll come a time where I'll
[2:01:08] never have to buy another
[2:01:11] car." That woke us up.
[2:01:17] We're
[2:01:19] Wow. Did you know that every car that
[2:01:23] dad's got all the way up till to the day
[2:01:25] has been bought, has been paid for,
[2:01:32] 40 years.
[2:01:36] They might not be
[2:01:38] fancy, but they brought my mus out now,
[2:01:41] but they were
[2:01:45] cars. Are y'all catching what I'm trying
[2:01:47] to
[2:01:49] say? This earthly
[2:01:51] rim does not hinder.
[2:01:59] Where you live does not hinder
[2:02:08] merit of God's grace to you.
[2:02:14] So, we access it through faith. We
[2:02:18] believe through faith. Can you say
[2:02:23] amen? How many wants to say, "Lord, I'm
[2:02:25] just going to I'm just going to get my
[2:02:27] faith out. I'm going to open that door.
[2:02:29] I'm going to go into those heavenly
[2:02:30] realms, and I'm going to take everything
[2:02:34] that you have promised.
[2:02:37] If the musicians would
[2:02:40] come, I've experienced
[2:02:44] grace. I've experienced
[2:02:47] it. Well, glory to God.
[2:02:51] You say, "I I need it." Well, this
[2:02:54] morning, if if the Lord has has given
[2:02:59] you a stimulation in your heart called
[2:03:02] faith, then you can take that
[2:03:05] substance, you can take that buying
[2:03:07] power. Brother Brandon talked about the
[2:03:10] bread. Amen. He says if you need bread
[2:03:13] and then someone comes up, now back then
[2:03:15] it was he says gives you 25 cents, but
[2:03:17] today it would be $2.50 or whatever.
[2:03:20] Amen. gives you gives you $3 and says,
[2:03:22] "Here, go buy you some bread." You don't
[2:03:24] have the bread, but you have the buying
[2:03:28] power. So, you don't have to ask, "I I I
[2:03:31] don't know if I can get bread." You
[2:03:33] know, you're going to get the bread
[2:03:34] because you've got the buying power.
[2:03:42] Get your $3 bill out. Amen. And take off
[2:03:47] to God's storehouse. You've got the
[2:03:50] buying power.
[2:03:56] Can you say amen?
[2:03:59] Talking about that, Brother Brandham
[2:04:01] would say, "When
[2:04:03] faith takes its hold in a heart, there's
[2:04:06] nothing can shake it. The work is
[2:04:08] finished. God has settled it. It's
[2:04:10] forever done. I go down the street. I
[2:04:13] cross over the river. I go through the
[2:04:15] brier patch. I get hungrier all the
[2:04:17] time. I haven't got the bread yet, but
[2:04:19] all the time I'm going, I'm rejoicing
[2:04:22] because I got the purchase power and the
[2:04:24] assurance that the bread belongs to me.
[2:04:26] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord or
[2:04:28] bless his holy name. Before I get there,
[2:04:32] I may have cramps. I'm so hungry. I may
[2:04:34] get delirious till I'm fighting my way
[2:04:37] through the bushes like a madman. But as
[2:04:39] long as I'm holding that 25 cents, the
[2:04:42] bread has got to come. There you are. As
[2:04:46] long as you your that faith is anchored,
[2:04:48] doctors may turn me down all everything.
[2:04:51] But I'll be there. I'll be healed. God
[2:04:53] said so. I'll let him into the door of
[2:04:57] my heart. My faith was given to him. He
[2:05:01] gave me the promise and nothing will
[2:05:04] interfere with it. It's there. It's
[2:05:06] faith. Can I hear a hallelujah?
[2:05:09] Oh, come on. Hallelujah.
[2:05:12] Somebody shout yes.
[2:05:16] Somebody shout, "It's mine.
[2:05:19] Healing is mine. Deliverance is mine. My
[2:05:22] children are mine. Salvation is mine.
[2:05:26] Victory is mine. A sound mind is mine.
[2:05:35] Glory to the lamb of God. Glory to the
[2:05:38] lamb of
[2:05:39] God. Hallelujah. Well, I don't know if
[2:05:43] you feel good, but I feel
[2:05:46] good. I think I might have just passed
[2:05:48] through that door this
[2:05:51] morning. Access
[2:05:53] into that grace.
[2:05:55] Access into all things
[2:05:59] possible. Father, we thank
[2:06:02] you. Thank you
[2:06:05] for never failing.
[2:06:09] Thank you for
[2:06:11] causing every
[2:06:17] promise to be ours through the access of
[2:06:24] faith. Who am
[2:06:27] I? Who am I to be given this
[2:06:31] grace? Who am I?
[2:06:39] Who am
[2:06:44] I?
[2:06:49] Lord,
[2:06:52] you're great
[2:06:55] love in your
[2:06:58] favor, your unmmerited
[2:07:01] favor, your divine favor.
[2:07:07] I say thank
[2:07:11] you. I thank you. I thank
[2:07:14] you. When I look across this
[2:07:16] [Music]
[2:07:18] congregation, how you've good you've
[2:07:23] been. You've reached way down.
[2:07:28] [Music]
[2:07:29] You've picked us up, Lord, in our
[2:07:32] lowliest
[2:07:35] state. Thank
[2:07:39] you. We see it. We see it with faith. We
[2:07:44] We see what you've done for
[2:07:46] us. And it causes our heart to be so
[2:07:49] humble.
[2:07:54] Thank you for what you've
[2:07:56] done for those around us. The brother,
[2:08:00] the sister sitting on the opposite
[2:08:04] pew, the one next to us, right side,
[2:08:07] left side. Thank
[2:08:11] you. Thank you for making us a
[2:08:14] citizen. Thank
[2:08:18] you. Our hearts are humbled this
[2:08:21] morning.
[2:08:27] We need excess, Lord. Some of us need an
[2:08:29] excess in your grace for a
[2:08:32] job. Some of us need
[2:08:36] access for healing in our
[2:08:41] minds. Maybe there's someone that needs
[2:08:45] access. The healing of a wounded
[2:08:47] spirit, bruised spirit.
[2:08:54] May maybe there's someone who's just
[2:08:56] needing access for the baptism of the
[2:08:58] Holy
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:03] Ghost. We're coming Lord with a approach
[2:09:06] of
[2:09:07] faith, love to you.
[2:09:11] We're coming with a
[2:09:14] heart of thanksgiving and
[2:09:19] worship. We love you, Lord, with all of
[2:09:22] our
[2:09:24] heart. Those that are sick, Lord, see
[2:09:27] sister Angie,
[2:09:30] Father, access,
[2:09:34] Lord, cause cause that faith to open the
[2:09:38] door.
[2:09:41] for miracles in her life and
[2:09:45] body. Steve Martin, Lord, our buddy,
[2:09:48] Lord, request him for prayer. Give him
[2:09:52] access this
[2:09:56] morning. Extend your golden sector up to
[2:10:02] him. Let him find your grace to be
[2:10:05] sufficient and plentiful.
[2:10:11] Brother Mitch, Lord, you see where he's
[2:10:13] at. Ask that your grace would be there
[2:10:15] in
[2:10:18] Alaska. Let it be
[2:10:24] planted. All of the needs that are here
[2:10:26] this
[2:10:29] morning, we're coming in, Lord, through
[2:10:31] that
[2:10:32] access. We see ourselves there. We
[2:10:35] believe it.
[2:10:38] We're not looking at our merits. We
[2:10:41] don't want to even give us what we're
[2:10:43] worth. If you gave us what we were
[2:10:45] worth, it'd be instant death and
[2:10:50] hell. We're not asking for our
[2:10:53] worth. We're asking for your grace.
[2:10:59] And your grace is
[2:11:02] bountiful,
[2:11:04] plentiful, endless,
[2:11:09] eternal. Lord, you see every need that
[2:11:11] is here this morning. We're not coming
[2:11:14] as beggars. We're coming as recipients
[2:11:17] of grace. You chose
[2:11:20] us. And we're coming with a heart of
[2:11:23] humility.
[2:11:25] And we're putting taking off the old
[2:11:28] garments of heaviness and unbelief and
[2:11:33] bitterness, the old garments
[2:11:36] of malice
[2:11:40] and
[2:11:43] sin. We're putting
[2:11:45] on those
[2:11:47] [Music]
[2:11:49] royal. We're going to put on the spirit
[2:11:52] of praise.
[2:11:55] Thanksgiving as we enter in to your
[2:12:00] courts. We love
[2:12:02] you in the name of

[2:12:22] Brandham would say, heaven is just a few
[2:12:24] feet away. I can feel
[2:12:26] it. He's near you this
[2:12:30] morning. Oh, access it. Oh, remove all
[2:12:34] the binders. Remove all of the
[2:12:37] limitations. Let your faith soar in the
[2:12:42] heavens. Thank you for it,
[2:12:45] Lord. Thank you for it,
[2:12:48] Father. We bless your name.
[2:12:53] We bless your
[2:12:56] name.

[2:32:51] all received their Pentecost baptized in
[2:32:56] Jesus name and are telling now both far
