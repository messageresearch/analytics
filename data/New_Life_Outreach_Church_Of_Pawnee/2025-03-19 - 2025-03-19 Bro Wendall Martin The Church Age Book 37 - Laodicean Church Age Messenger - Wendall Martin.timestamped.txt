[14:36] Lord Jesus Christ can the church say
[14:40] amen and amen God bless you you can be
[14:43] seated here this
[14:45] evening
[14:47] so um sister Bella it's good to see you
[14:50] back here amen and uh yall going to have
[14:54] to excuse me here this is just a Sunday
[14:56] night or something might this
[14:59] this Podium here is rocking back and
[15:01] forth and I don't know what the deal is
[15:03] but I'm going to inspect
[15:05] it
[15:07] hallelujah
[15:09] amen let's see if that helps
[15:12] us see I would have been fighting with
[15:15] that all night long if I didn't do that
[15:17] and U so we are we are in the um the
[15:23] layo ofan age and if you if you
[15:26] notice um all of all of these other ages
[15:30] that we have read over the last um uh
[15:34] few well over this last
[15:37] year um these ages when they would start
[15:42] out the the Holy
[15:44] Spirit um Jesus Jesus Christ himself in
[15:49] every one of those ages he would point
[15:52] to the good he would point he would he
[15:55] would point out um
[15:59] the the um the incredible faith and
[16:02] their patience and he would point out a
[16:05] lot of good things um to to those Church
[16:10] ages each one of those but when if we if
[16:13] you notice that when we read here in in
[16:15] this leoan age there's not one good
[16:19] thing that he said there's nothing there
[16:22] he's saying that you're totally blind
[16:24] you are you you you are wretched and the
[16:29] and the only hope that that the the
[16:33] elect even has in in in this is is uh he
[16:37] that overcometh that there will be an
[16:40] elect with a germ seed of God even when
[16:43] the Christendom goes totally dark amen
[16:46] when it will become so religious and
[16:49] when religion will become so perfected
[16:52] that Christ will be on the outside of
[16:55] the church amen and and and and until
[16:59] the the false Vine has so uh taken root
[17:05] and taken over until there there will be
[17:08] a slight minority and that Minority will
[17:10] be the ones that'll truly overcome and
[17:13] the Rapture Jesus remember what Jesus
[17:15] said now amen Jesus says As it was in
[17:18] the days of Noah wherein eight Souls
[17:20] were saved so shall it be in the coming
[17:23] of the son of man so when Jesus
[17:27] returns um uh
[17:29] there there's going to be very few make
[17:32] it and so let us make sure as we start
[17:35] here tonight amen as we as we read there
[17:39] there at the at the End Amen we're all
[17:43] involved in this I mean we we this this
[17:45] thing this the these religious Spirits
[17:48] have have even got on have have even got
[17:51] on the elect amen until God is saying
[17:55] you're you're needing to counsel you're
[17:57] needing to buy some gold you're needing
[17:59] to put on some white reignment and and
[18:01] and the 19th verse as many as I love and
[18:05] you can put that back up there sister
[18:06] Keys 3:19 as many as I love I chase I
[18:11] rebuke and chasen be zous thee therefore
[18:16] and repent so brother Brandon would say
[18:18] the Zeal of the age is the ability to
[18:23] say I'm wrong amen and and the elect is
[18:27] the only ones that can truly say that
[18:30] I'm wrong help me Lord to be right help
[18:33] me Lord to never let my pride override
[18:38] your Holy Spirit in my life and so as we
[18:42] as as we look into this amen I think
[18:45] it's very important because the the the
[18:49] sin has become so deceptive until the
[18:52] angel of Satan has has transformed
[18:55] himself into an angel of Light and he's
[18:58] trans transformed himself in in such a
[19:01] way that that
[19:04] people uh uh uh uh feel that they are
[19:07] right they are convincing themselves
[19:09] that they're okay and the spirit of the
[19:11] Lord has departed from them amen as it's
[19:15] done in this church Age and and it shows
[19:17] that they are justifying themselves not
[19:21] with the
[19:22] righteousness which is the garments of
[19:25] of righteousness which is the you the
[19:27] righteousness of the Saints amen they
[19:29] they are justifying themselves with with
[19:33] other means instead of the Holy Spirit
[19:36] convicting them by the word now with
[19:39] this being such a deceitful age amen God
[19:44] was not just going to leave it to a
[19:47] preacher he was not just going to leave
[19:49] it to a to a um uh uh a pastor or
[19:55] evangelist uh uh or a um uh you know a
[20:00] missionary or a teacher amen or or even
[20:04] a a five-fold Ministry Prophet this age
[20:08] was going to be so crazy
[20:11] deceptive that God was going to send a
[20:15] prophet a word Prophet now this Prophet
[20:19] this this word Prophet that's different
[20:23] from the uh the the five-fold ministry
[20:26] Prophet amen there is there there as we
[20:29] say there is the five-fold ministry amen
[20:32] that has the the the pastor uh uh uh
[20:35] teacher Apostle the the uh evangelist
[20:39] and the prophet but there but the the uh
[20:43] word Prophet is one that is that is
[20:47] called uh from his birth and ordained he
[20:51] specially built to be a a prophet to
[20:56] that age to a generation Isaiah was
[21:00] raised up as a prophet to that
[21:02] generation there were going to be many
[21:04] other prophets come and go there would
[21:06] be Minor Prophets amen but they wouldn't
[21:10] be word prophets and these these these
[21:13] word prophets are are are are are able
[21:16] to get into God's mind and to to
[21:20] interpret God's word like nobody else
[21:24] amen they're built to withstand anything
[21:27] and everything and what whatever that
[21:29] the scripture says there concerning
[21:31] Samuel that that God never let any of
[21:34] his words fall to the ground Jeremiah 1
[21:37] and5 it says I have raised thee up even
[21:39] as a child I've raised thee up Amen to
[21:43] pluck down Nations to build up Nations I
[21:46] these these word prophets amen are not
[21:51] just in in a in a local vicinity but
[21:55] they they are are are to to um uh they
[22:00] are to the world so so when God s when
[22:04] we talk about God sending a Propet in in
[22:07] our
[22:08] generation I I I want you to really
[22:11] understand and those that of you that
[22:12] are on that are watching us by line Amen
[22:16] brother bradam and and as we go through
[22:19] this here tonight as we get started in
[22:21] it this is not just another
[22:25] opinion amen now this this message in Le
[22:29] osia is just is not just a another book
[22:34] in on your shelf amen alongside everyone
[22:38] else's
[22:40] books this is not
[22:42] it amen God sends a prophet to an
[22:48] age and we must take heed to what that
[22:53] Prophet says or we will be deceived with
[22:57] everyone else when they're deceived
[22:59] amen now now this is very important so
[23:02] when God come in in this age and he's
[23:05] preparing for a Rapture then God is is
[23:10] Duty bound he is Duty bound to make sure
[23:14] his elect gets it
[23:18] straight I figured I would hear an
[23:21] amen and that elect is Duty bound to
[23:26] make sure they line everything up about
[23:28] them and their Christian walk and
[23:30] everything about them with this
[23:35] message now as we get started
[23:40] here um and we're going to be talking
[23:43] about the
[23:44] messenger and um it's going to go but it
[23:47] we might we might end up taking uh two
[23:49] or three services on the messenger
[23:51] because I I believe that we have we have
[23:54] so much scripture and and we're going to
[23:56] go through a lot of scripture here
[23:58] tonight tonight so how many's ready amen
[24:00] did you bring your
[24:02] books all right amen so let's let's look
[24:05] here now we have already read uh again
[24:09] in your blue books we're at
[24:11] 3:18 and um uh here it's it's chapter
[24:15] nine and we've already read all of that
[24:18] first uh the bi the scripture verses so
[24:20] let's go to the city of
[24:22] Leota the name leosia which means
[24:25] people's rights were very common
[24:29] um uh was very common and was given to
[24:33] several cities in honor of Royal ladies
[24:36] so
[24:37] named this city was one of the most
[24:40] peculiar or politically important and
[24:42] financially flourishing cities in Asia
[24:45] Minor enormous amounts of property were
[24:47] bequeathed to the city from Pro
[24:49] prominent citizens it was the seat of a
[24:52] great Medical School its people were
[24:54] distinguished in the Arts and Sciences
[24:57] it was often called the uh Metropolis as
[25:01] it was uh the county seat for uh 25
[25:05] other cities the Pagan God worshiped
[25:08] there was Zeus in fact this city was
[25:11] once uh called
[25:14] diis city of Zeus in honor of their
[25:17] great God in the fourth Century an
[25:20] important Church Council was held there
[25:23] uh frequent earthquakes finally caused
[25:26] its complete abandonment how fitting
[25:29] were the characteristics of this last
[25:31] age to represent the age in which uh we
[25:34] now live for example they worshiped one
[25:37] God Zeus who was the chief and father of
[25:41] the Gods this
[25:43] forecast the 20th century one God father
[25:47] of us all religious pre uh premise that
[25:50] sets forth the Brotherhood of Man and is
[25:53] even now bringing together the
[25:55] Protestants Catholics Jews Hindus Etc
[25:59] with the intent that a mutual form of
[26:01] worship will increase our love and
[26:04] understanding and care of each other the
[26:07] Catholics and Protestants are even now
[26:10] striving for and actually gaining ground
[26:13] in this Union with vowed intent that all
[26:16] others will follow this very attitude
[26:20] was seen in the United Nations
[26:22] organization when the world leaders
[26:24] refuse to
[26:25] recognize any one individual cont cep of
[26:28] spiritual worship but recommended
[26:31] putting aside all those separate
[26:33] concepts with the hopes that all
[26:35] religions become leveled into one for uh
[26:39] for all desire the same goals all have
[26:43] the same purposes all are basically
[26:45] right notice the name Le oosa the
[26:48] people's rights or Justice of the people
[26:51] people's was there an age uh like the
[26:54] 20th century age that has seen all
[26:56] nations rising up and demand Landing
[26:58] equality socially and
[27:00] financially this is the age of the
[27:03] Communist where all men are supposedly
[27:05] equal though it is only so in
[27:08] theory this is the age of political
[27:10] parties who call themselves Christian
[27:12] democrats Christian socialist Christian
[27:15] Commonwealth Federation
[27:17] Etc according to our liberal theologians
[27:20] Jesus was a socialist and the early
[27:23] church under the guidance of the spirit
[27:25] practice socialism thus we ought to do
[27:28] so today when the Ancients called Le
[27:32] osia the Metro uh uh Metropolis it was
[27:35] looking forward to the One World
[27:37] Government that we are now uh setting
[27:40] up as we think of that City being the
[27:43] location of a great church Council we
[27:46] see foreshadow the economical e e
[27:49] ecumenical move uh taking place today
[27:52] wherein very soon we will see all the
[27:55] so-called Christians come together
[27:57] indeed the church and state religion and
[27:59] politics are coming together the tears
[28:02] are being bound the wheat will soon be
[28:04] ready for the Garner it was the city of
[28:06] earthquakes such earthquakes as finally
[28:10] destroyed it this age will end in God
[28:12] shaking the whole world that has gone
[28:15] off to make love with the old Harlot not
[28:18] only will the world's systems crumble
[28:20] but the very Earth will be shaken and
[28:22] then renovated for the millennial reign
[28:24] of Christ the city was rich endowed with
[28:28] with by by the wealthy it was full of
[28:30] culture science
[28:33] abounded how like today the churches are
[28:36] rich the worship is beautiful and formal
[28:38] but cold and dead culture and education
[28:42] have taken the place of the spirit-given
[28:44] word and faith has been superseded by
[28:47] science so that man is a victim of
[28:51] materialism in every attribute ancient
[28:54] Leota is found reborn in the 20th
[28:57] century
[28:59] leoan age in the mercy of God those who
[29:03] have an ear to hear come out of her that
[29:07] they be not partakers of her sins and
[29:09] the subsequent judgment the leoan age
[29:13] the leoan age began around the turn of
[29:16] the century perhaps
[29:18] 1906 how long will it last as a servant
[29:22] of God who has multitudes of visions of
[29:25] which none has ever failed let me
[29:27] predict
[29:29] I did not say prophesy but predict that
[29:33] this age will end around
[29:36] 1977 if you will pardon a personal note
[29:39] here I base this prediction on seven
[29:41] major continuous visions that came to me
[29:44] one Sunday morning in June
[29:47] 1933 the Lord Jesus spoke to me and said
[29:51] that the coming of the Lord was drawing
[29:53] nigh but that before he came seven major
[29:57] events would
[29:58] transpire I wrote them down that morning
[30:01] and gave forth the revelation of the
[30:03] Lord the first Vision was melini would
[30:06] invade Ethiopia and that Nation would
[30:09] fall at its steps that Vision surely did
[30:12] cause some repercussions and some were
[30:15] very angry when I said it and would not
[30:17] believe it but it happened that way he
[30:20] just walked in there with his modern
[30:22] arms and took over the natives didn't
[30:24] have a chance but the vision also said
[30:27] that melini would come to an horrible
[30:30] end with with his own people turning on
[30:33] him and that came to pass just exactly
[30:35] as it was said the next Vision foretold
[30:39] was of an Australian by the name of
[30:40] Adolf
[30:41] Hitler would rise up as a dictator over
[30:45] Germany and that he would draw the world
[30:47] into war and it showed the sigfred line
[30:50] how our troops would have a terrible
[30:52] time to overcome it and then showed
[30:55] Hitler would come to a mysterious end
[30:58] the third Vision was in the rims of the
[31:01] world politics for it showed me that
[31:04] there would be three great isms facism
[31:07] Nazism and
[31:10] communism but that the first two would
[31:12] be swallowed up into the third The Voice
[31:15] admonished watch Russia watch Russia
[31:19] keep your eye on the King of the North
[31:22] the fourth Vision showed the great
[31:24] advances in science that would come
[31:27] after to the world war it was headed up
[31:30] in the vision of a plastic bubble topped
[31:32] car that was running down the beautiful
[31:35] highways under remote control so that
[31:37] people people appeared seated in this
[31:40] car without a steering wheel and they
[31:43] were playing some sort of a game to
[31:45] amuse
[31:47] themselves the fifth Vision had to do
[31:49] with a moral problem of our age
[31:51] centering mostly around women God showed
[31:54] me that women would be out of their
[31:56] place with the granting of the vote
[31:58] that they uh cut off their hair uh then
[32:01] they cut off their hair which signified
[32:03] they were no longer under the authority
[32:05] of a man but insisted on either equal
[32:08] rights or in most cases more than equal
[32:10] rights she adopted man's clothing and
[32:13] went into the state of undress until the
[32:15] last picture I saw was a woman naked
[32:19] except for a little fig leaf type
[32:21] apron with with this Vision I saw the
[32:24] terrible perversion and the moral plight
[32:27] of the whole world then in the sixth
[32:29] Vision there arose up in America a most
[32:32] beautiful but cruel woman she helped the
[32:35] people in her complete power I believed
[32:38] that this was the rise of the Roman
[32:40] Catholic Church though I knew it could
[32:41] possibly be a vision of some woman
[32:44] rising in great power in America due to
[32:46] a popular vote by the women the last and
[32:49] seventh Vision was where in I heard a
[32:53] most terrible
[32:54] explosion as I turned to look I saw
[32:57] nothing but debris craters and smoke all
[33:00] over the land of America based on these
[33:03] seven Visions along with the rapid
[33:05] changes which have swept the world in
[33:07] the last 50 years I predict I do not
[33:11] prophesy that these Visions will will
[33:15] have all come to pass by
[33:17] 1977 and though many may feel this is
[33:20] irresponsible statement in view of the
[33:22] fact that Jesus said no man knoweth the
[33:25] day or the
[33:26] hour I still maintained this prediction
[33:28] after 30 years because Jesus did not say
[33:32] no man knows the year month or week in
[33:35] which he's coming uh was to be completed
[33:38] so I repeat I sincerely believe and
[33:40] maintain as a private student student of
[33:43] the word along with the divine
[33:45] inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate
[33:49] the world systems and Usher in the
[33:51] Millennium now let me say this can
[33:53] anyone prove any of those Visions wrong
[33:56] were they not all fulfilled yes each one
[34:00] has been fulfilled or is in the process
[34:03] right now melini invaded Ethiopia
[34:06] successfully and then fell and lost it
[34:09] all Hitler started a war he could not
[34:12] finish and died
[34:13] mysteriously communism took over both
[34:16] the other two isms the plastic bubble
[34:19] car has been built and is awaiting only
[34:22] a better network of Roads women are all
[34:26] but naked
[34:28] and are even now wearing topless bathing
[34:30] suits just the other day I saw in a
[34:33] magazine the very dress that I saw in my
[34:36] vision if you can call it a dress it was
[34:39] a plastic transparent type cloth with
[34:42] with three darken spots that covered
[34:45] both the breast in in a small area and
[34:48] then a dark spot uh a place for a small
[34:50] apron below the Catholic church is on
[34:53] the rise we have had one Catholic
[34:56] President will no doubt have another
[34:57] other what is left nothing except
[35:00] Hebrews
[35:01] 12:26 whose voice then shook the Earth
[35:05] but now he hath promised saying yet once
[35:08] more I shake not the Earth only but also
[35:11] the heaven once more God will shake the
[35:15] Earth and with it shake everything loose
[35:18] that can be shaken then he will renovate
[35:21] it just last March
[35:24] 1964 that good uh day Friday that or
[35:28] that Good Friday earthquake of Alaska
[35:30] shook the whole world though it did not
[35:32] unbalance it but God was warning by a
[35:36] world Tremor what he will soon do on a
[35:39] greater scale he's going to blast and
[35:42] rock this sin cursed world my brother
[35:44] and my sister and there is only one
[35:47] place that can stand that shock that is
[35:50] in the fold of the Lord Jesus I would
[35:53] beseech you while God's Mercy is still
[35:56] available to you that you give your
[35:58] whole life unreservedly to Jesus Christ
[36:02] who is the faithful Shepherd uh who as
[36:06] the faithful Shepherd will save you and
[36:09] care for you and present you FL Flawless
[36:12] in glory with exceeding great joy now
[36:17] before we go to the messenger now this
[36:20] this little particular uh uh spot that
[36:23] we have just read
[36:24] that brother renham predicted
[36:28] that that
[36:29] 1977 would um uh would would be the end
[36:34] of the world that there would it would
[36:36] Usher in the Millennium of the Rapture
[36:38] of the church and of course we are in
[36:40] we're in uh
[36:43] 2025 and so uh there is there there
[36:47] there's so much all over the Internet
[36:49] that that says see he's a false prophet
[36:52] he predicted and his predictions were
[36:55] wrong and and and they say he prophesied
[36:58] and so he was you know he he was wrong
[37:00] but but did did you guys read exactly
[37:04] the way brother brandham said it he said
[37:06] I don't prophesy this is something that
[37:09] I'm predicting as a private student of
[37:13] the scripture compared with his visions
[37:16] that he had seen and he had seen all of
[37:19] these Visions already lined up and
[37:22] coming to pass there was only one or two
[37:24] left and so he was looking at it and is
[37:27] saying listen I don't see I don't see
[37:30] how it can go beyond
[37:31] 1977 he did not say the Lord told him
[37:35] that that was that was a prophet who had
[37:39] seen all of these others who had seen
[37:42] the interpretation of the scripture and
[37:44] was saying listen we are close to the
[37:47] coming of the Lord amen so so now you
[37:52] know you you you you you say well a
[37:55] prophet predicts that's what that's what
[37:57] a prophet prophecy is is prediction no
[37:58] brother brandom told us the difference
[38:00] right there this is not a prophecy this
[38:04] is a prediction as a private student of
[38:08] the scripture amen so so now now now
[38:12] that we've got that over with h I'm just
[38:15] so amazed at at these driverless
[38:18] cars that that are that have been
[38:20] perfected and and that are are driving
[38:23] who some somebody uh somebody in the
[38:26] church here took a picture of a car who
[38:28] was
[38:29] that uh took a took a picture uh of a of
[38:33] a
[38:35] car brother Bryce brother Bryce uh sent
[38:40] a video and and uh he's driving beside a
[38:44] driverless car and and it's just going
[38:47] along the highway there and there ain't
[38:48] a steering wheel in it at all and uh and
[38:52] so he got a he got a video of it he says
[38:54] you know I've seen you know he's seen
[38:56] the bubble and and and the the Little D
[38:57] with this here just looked like a normal
[38:59] car with nothing uh you know it was just
[39:02] a regular car and uh anyways uh listen
[39:06] we we we we have we should be so
[39:09] thankful that God would come and send us
[39:14] uh eyesight in this day so that we can
[39:17] see listen if we're blind we've got to
[39:20] be willfully blind because God truly did
[39:23] send a prophet messenger not to start
[39:27] another group not to get his own
[39:30] Doctrine but to take us back to
[39:33] scripture so that we can relate to Jesus
[39:37] Christ and this Rapture can you say amen
[39:41] amen all right let's go let's go on down
[39:44] uh we're going to start there at the
[39:45] messenger I doubt very much if any age
[39:48] truly knew the messenger that God had
[39:50] sent unto it except in the first age
[39:53] where Paul was the messenger and even in
[39:56] that age many did not recognize him for
[39:59] what he was now the age in which we are
[40:02] living is going to be a very short one
[40:04] events are going to transpire very
[40:07] quickly rapidly so the messenger to the
[40:10] lotsy and age has to be here now though
[40:13] perhaps we don't know him as yet uh but
[40:16] there will surely have to be a time that
[40:19] he becomes known now I can prove that
[40:22] because we have scripture that describes
[40:25] his ministry now I I want to to just
[40:27] really really really think about that no
[40:30] other
[40:32] age has been given more scripture
[40:35] concerning its
[40:39] messenger amen now all of my friends
[40:41] that are watching online amen I want you
[40:44] to think about it no other age no other
[40:49] people in church history from 190 uh uh
[40:53] uh uh from from from Pentecost all the
[40:55] way to now had more more had more
[40:59] scripture pointing to a man than in this
[41:04] generation amen hallelujah now we're
[41:07] fixing to get into a lot of scripture
[41:08] here and so um and I think it's going to
[41:11] be a wonderful wonderful
[41:13] lesson it says now I can prove that
[41:16] because we have scripture that describes
[41:17] his ministry first of all the messenger
[41:19] is going to be a prophet he will have
[41:22] the office of a prophet he will have the
[41:24] prophetic Ministry it will be based
[41:27] solidly on the word because when he
[41:30] prophesies or has a vision it will
[41:32] always be word oriented and it will
[41:35] always come to pass he will be
[41:38] Vindicated as a prophet because of this
[41:40] accuracy the proof that he is a prophet
[41:43] is found in Revelations 10 and 7 but in
[41:46] the days of the voice of the seventh
[41:48] messenger when he shall begin to sound
[41:50] the mystery of God should be finished as
[41:53] he hath declared to his servants the
[41:55] prophets now this person who in this
[41:58] verse is called an angel in the King
[42:00] James version was not a Heavenly being
[42:04] the sixth trumpling Angel who is a who
[42:08] is a Heavenly being is in Revelations 9
[42:13] and13 and the seventh like in of like
[42:17] order is in Revelations 11 and 15 now I
[42:22] want you to I want you to catch it
[42:23] because if you if you go back if you
[42:25] turn in your Bibles real quickly um
[42:27] there there will be there will be those
[42:29] that says well you've you you're you're
[42:31] missing you're mixing scripture up but
[42:34] we're not mixing scripture up if you
[42:36] look there
[42:37] in in in uh Revelations 8 and
[42:43] 7 this these are the trumpeting angels
[42:47] and the first the first Angel
[42:50] sounded and and it and it goes on Amen
[42:54] then you go on down to the eth verse 88
[42:57] and the second Angel sounded and it and
[43:01] it talks about that trumpet down to the
[43:03] 10th verse and the third Angel sounded
[43:07] and it talks about that trumpet and then
[43:09] the 12th verse the fourth Angel sounded
[43:13] and it talks about that trumpet and then
[43:15] you go on down to the ninth chapter
[43:17] first verse and the fifth angel sounded
[43:20] and it goes and talks about that trumpet
[43:23] the 13th verse the sixth Angel sounded
[43:27] and it goes talking about that trumpet
[43:29] but
[43:30] then then there is a
[43:33] partical uh a parentheses if you will
[43:36] amen a partical uh uh uh passage it
[43:39] simply means it's a remark or a passage
[43:42] that departs from the theme so so right
[43:44] in the middle right as it's talking here
[43:46] of the trumpets and then it comes in and
[43:49] says and I saw a mighty Angel and so
[43:51] it's coming down and it and it begins to
[43:54] to talk about that so then you go to the
[43:56] 11 th chapter and the 15th verse and and
[44:01] then it goes back to the trumpeting
[44:02] Angel and the seventh angel sounded and
[44:06] then goes on delivers what the trumpet
[44:08] said so so we've got from from the sixth
[44:11] angel now there in 9 and 13 and then we
[44:15] go uh to 11 and 15 to the seventh angel
[44:20] that sounded the trumpet so so are yall
[44:22] understanding that so so it is it is
[44:25] important because God breaks in at this
[44:28] at this last time and there is a reason
[44:30] that these things are are there is
[44:32] because right at the time of the
[44:34] tribulation right at the time of the man
[44:37] of sin right about the time that these
[44:39] things are going to be going on there is
[44:41] a Rapture that has got to take place
[44:44] before these things can take can can
[44:46] take place so so God is God's stopping
[44:49] the whole thing and says but I seen a
[44:51] mighty Angel that's going to deliver you
[44:54] from all of this mess are y'all are
[44:56] y'all understanding
[44:57] and the mighty Angel hands down the book
[45:00] to to the seventh angel messenger which
[45:04] is an Earthly messenger and which is a
[45:07] prophet all right so we'll get into that
[45:08] a little bit more but I just wanted to
[45:10] show you in scripture the uh uh uh where
[45:13] where it starts and stops so you've got
[45:14] the six uh uh
[45:17] uh you know trumpet blowing Angel and
[45:21] then you've got the seventh trumpet
[45:23] blowing Angel amen these are angels
[45:26] Angelic beings
[45:27] amen but this messenger that's come in
[45:30] Revelations
[45:31] 107 is an Earthly Messenger to Proclaim
[45:35] to the bride and uh the word of God and
[45:38] get us ready amen did I confuse you or
[45:40] did I help
[45:42] you some of you are looking amen all
[45:44] right goad and tell me that's all right
[45:46] what what what have I confused you
[45:49] about okay all right well if uh uh if
[45:53] you want uh feel feel free to on these
[45:56] on these Wednesday night night because
[45:57] it'll it'll help other people too all
[45:59] right let's let's keep
[46:01] going all right so
[46:05] um okay so he says up there at the top
[46:08] of the 3:24 the six trumpeting Angel who
[46:11] is in a Heavenly being is in N9
[46:15] Revelations 9:13 and the seventh of like
[46:17] order is in Revelations
[46:20] 11:15 this one here in Revelations 107
[46:24] is the seventh angel messenger and and
[46:27] it is a man he is to bring a message
[46:30] from God and his message and Ministry is
[46:33] going to finish the mystery of God as
[46:36] declared to his servants the prophets
[46:38] God is going to treat this last
[46:41] Messenger as a prophet because he is a
[46:44] prophet that is what Paul was in the
[46:47] first age and the last age has one too
[46:50] Amos 36 to 7 the uh shall a trumpet be
[46:53] blown in the city and the people not be
[46:55] afraid shall there be an evil in the
[46:58] city and the Lord ha not done it surely
[47:01] the Lord will do nothing but he
[47:02] revealeth his secret unto his servants
[47:05] the prophets it was in the end time
[47:08] period that the seven thunders of Jesus
[47:10] came forth Revelations 103 and four and
[47:15] cried with a loud voice as when a lion
[47:18] Roth and when he had cried seven
[47:20] Thunders uttered their voices and when
[47:23] the seven Thunders had uttered their
[47:24] voices I was about to write and I heard
[47:26] of voice from Heaven saying unto me seal
[47:28] up those things which the seven Thunders
[47:30] uttered and write them not what was in
[47:34] those voices or or those Thunders no one
[47:36] knows but we need to know it will take a
[47:39] prophet to get the Revelation because
[47:42] God has no other way of bringing out his
[47:45] scriptural Revelations except by a
[47:48] prophet the word always came by a
[47:52] prophet and always
[47:54] will now that this is a law is is the
[47:58] law of God is evident because even a
[48:01] casual search of
[48:02] scripture the unchanging God with
[48:05] unchanging ways invariably sent his
[48:08] Propet in every age where the people had
[48:11] strayed from divine order with both the
[48:14] theologians and the people having
[48:15] departed from the word God always sent
[48:18] his servants to these people but apart
[48:21] from the theologians in order to correct
[48:23] false teaching and lead people back to
[48:26] God
[48:27] so we see a seventh age messenger coming
[48:31] and he is a prophet not only do we see
[48:34] this messenger coming here in
[48:35] Revelations
[48:37] 10:7 but we find that the word speaks of
[48:41] Elijah coming before Jesus returns in
[48:45] Matthew
[48:46] 17:10 his disciples asked him saying why
[48:50] then shall uh say the scribes that Elias
[48:53] must first come Jesus said Elias truly
[48:57] shall first come and restore all things
[49:01] before the coming of Our Lord Elijah
[49:04] must come back for a work of restoration
[49:09] in the church this is what Malachi 4 5
[49:13] and six says
[49:16] behold I will send you Elijah the
[49:19] prophet before the coming of the great
[49:21] and Dreadful day of the Lord and he
[49:24] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[49:26] the children
[49:27] and the Heart of the children to their
[49:28] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[49:30] with a curse there is absolutely no
[49:33] doubt that Elijah must return can I hear
[49:36] an amen before the coming of Jesus he
[49:40] has a specific work to accomplish that
[49:43] work is the part of Malachi 4 and6 that
[49:46] says he will turn the hearts of the
[49:48] children to their fathers the reason
[49:52] that we know this is his specific work
[49:55] to do uh
[49:57] is to do at the at that time let me
[50:01] start over the reason that we know that
[50:03] this is his specific work to do at that
[50:05] time is because he has already
[50:08] accomplished the part that says he turns
[50:10] the children or the hearts of the
[50:12] fathers to the
[50:13] children when the Elijah Ministry was
[50:16] here in John the Baptist Luke 1: 17 he
[50:20] shall go before him in the spirit and
[50:23] power of Elijah to turn the hearts of
[50:26] the fathers to the children and the
[50:27] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[50:30] make ready a people prepared for the
[50:32] Lord in the ministry of John the hearts
[50:35] of the fathers were turned to the
[50:37] children we know that because Jesus said
[50:40] so but it does not say the hearts of the
[50:43] children were turned to the fathers this
[50:46] is yet to take place the hearts of the
[50:48] last day children will be turned back to
[50:51] the Pentecostal fathers John got the
[50:54] fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the
[50:56] children into the fold now this Prophet
[50:59] upon whom the spirit of Elijah Falls
[51:02] will prepare the children to welcome
[51:04] back Jesus so so are y'all understanding
[51:07] that now now we're fixing to uh go in a
[51:10] little bit more and he's going to show
[51:11] you how uh another
[51:15] scripture uh Jesus talking about his
[51:18] first coming and his second coming and
[51:20] yet it was all in the same it's all in
[51:22] the same verse so so John the Baptist he
[51:26] fulfilled the first coming he fulfilled
[51:29] the the Turning of the children to the
[51:32] fathers or or the the fathers to the
[51:35] children and now after we've come
[51:37] throughout of all of these ages and
[51:39] there's so many denominations and
[51:41] there's so much nonsense that's going on
[51:43] there's got to come a prophet that's
[51:44] going to take your heart and turn you
[51:48] back to the father's to the Bible and
[51:52] it's important because it's in this age
[51:55] again that we are totally blind it's
[51:59] it's it's the
[52:01] leysia is there is there is no good
[52:05] matter of fact when when brother random
[52:07] uh seen the vision of the candlesticks
[52:10] did you know that the the leoan age was
[52:12] totally dark totally black and the angel
[52:15] of the lord gave him permission to put a
[52:17] little bit of light in there and you
[52:19] know what that light
[52:21] represents we were blinded but we were
[52:24] elect and so God God God gave that
[52:27] little light amen so it's important for
[52:30] us to know God let us see the real Jesus
[52:36] Christ amen all
[52:39] right
[52:40] now we will um let's let's let's
[52:43] continue
[52:45] on uh Jesus Jesus called John the
[52:48] Baptist Elijah Matthew 17 and12 but I
[52:52] say unto you Elijah is come already and
[52:55] they knew him not
[52:56] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[52:59] listed the reason that he called John
[53:01] Elijah was because the same spirit that
[53:04] was upon Elijah had come back upon John
[53:08] even as that Spirit had come back upon
[53:11] Elisha after the reign of King Ahab now
[53:15] once again the spirit will come upon
[53:18] another man just before Jesus comes he
[53:22] will be a prophet he will be Vindicated
[53:25] as such by God since Jesus himself in
[53:28] the flesh won't be here to vindicate him
[53:31] as he did John it will be done by the
[53:34] holy spirit so that this prophet's
[53:36] ministry will be attended by great and
[53:39] wonderful
[53:41] manifestation as a prophet every
[53:43] revelation will be Vindicated for every
[53:46] revelation will come to pass wonderful
[53:48] acts of power will be performed at his
[53:50] commands in faith that will be brought
[53:54] forth then will be brought forth the
[53:56] message message that God has given him
[53:57] in the word to turn forth the message
[54:01] that God has given him in the word uh to
[54:04] to turn the people back to the truth of
[54:07] the true power and the true power of God
[54:10] some will listen but the majority will
[54:13] run true to form and reject him since
[54:16] this Prophet messenger of Revelations
[54:18] 10:7 will be the same as Malachi 45 and
[54:22] 6 he will naturally be like Elijah and
[54:26] John
[54:27] both were set apart both men were set
[54:29] apart from accepted religious schools of
[54:31] their
[54:32] day both were men of the Wilderness both
[54:35] acted only when they had thus sayeth the
[54:37] Lord straight from God by Revelation
[54:40] both lashed out against religious orders
[54:42] and leaders of their day but not only
[54:45] was that so they lashed out against all
[54:48] who were corrupt and would corrupt
[54:49] others notice that both prophesied much
[54:53] against immoral women and their and
[54:55] their ways Elijah cried out against
[54:58] Jezebel John rebuked herodias Philip's
[55:01] wife though he was not popular or will
[55:04] not be popular he will be Vindicated by
[55:06] God as Jesus authenticated John and the
[55:11] Holy Ghost authenticated Jesus we can
[55:13] well expect this man will be the first
[55:17] uh uh will be first of all authenticated
[55:19] by the spirit working in his life and
[55:21] acts of power that are undisputable and
[55:24] found nowhere else and Jes Jesus himself
[55:27] in returning will authenticate him even
[55:29] as his as he authenticated John John
[55:33] witnessed that Jesus was coming so will
[55:36] this man like John witness that Jesus is
[55:39] coming their very return of Christ will
[55:42] prove that this man indeed was the
[55:45] Forerunner of his second coming this is
[55:48] the final
[55:49] evidence uh this is the final evidence
[55:52] that this indeed is the prophet of
[55:54] Malachi 4 for the end of the Gentile
[55:57] period will be Jesus himself appearing
[56:01] then it will be too late for those who
[56:03] have rejected him in order to further
[56:05] clarify our presentation of this last
[56:07] day Prophet let us particularly note
[56:10] that uh that the prophet of Matthew
[56:13] 1112 was John the Baptist who was the
[56:16] one
[56:17] foretold in Malachi 3:1 behold I will
[56:21] send my messenger and he shall prepare
[56:23] the way before me and the Lord whom he
[56:26] seek shall suddenly come to his Temple
[56:29] even the messenger of the Covenant whom
[56:31] ye Delight in behold he shall come saith
[56:34] the Lord of hosts Matthew
[56:38] 111-12 and it came to pass when Jesus
[56:40] had made an end of commanding his 12
[56:42] disciples he departed then to teach and
[56:46] to preach in their cities now when John
[56:48] had heard in the prison The Works of
[56:50] Christ he sent two of his disciples and
[56:53] said unto him art thou he that should
[56:55] come or do we look for for another Jesus
[56:58] answered and said unto them go and show
[56:59] John again those things which you do
[57:01] hear and see the blind receive their
[57:03] sight the lame walk the lepers are
[57:05] cleansed the deaf hear the dead are
[57:08] raised up the poor have the gospel
[57:09] preached to them blessed is he whosoever
[57:12] shall not be offended in
[57:14] me and as they departed Jesus began to
[57:17] say unto the multitudes concerning John
[57:20] what went ye out into the Wilderness to
[57:22] see a reed shaken with the wind but what
[57:26] went ye out for to see a man clothed in
[57:29] sth rment behold they that wear sth
[57:32] clothing are in King's houses but what
[57:35] went ye out for to see a prophet yay I
[57:39] say unto you and more than a prophet for
[57:42] this is he of whom it is written behold
[57:46] I send my messenger before thy face
[57:49] which shall prepare thy way before thee
[57:52] verily I say unto you among them that
[57:54] are born of a woman there hath not risen
[57:56] a greater than John the Baptist
[57:59] notwithstanding he that is least in the
[58:02] Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he
[58:04] this has already taken place this has
[58:07] happened it is over but note now in
[58:11] Malachi
[58:13] 41-6 for behold the day cometh that
[58:16] shall burn as an oven and all the proud
[58:20] yay and all that do wickedly shall be
[58:22] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[58:25] burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts
[58:28] that it shall leave them neither root
[58:31] nor Branch but unto you that fear my
[58:34] name shall the son of righteousness
[58:35] arise with healing in his wings and ye
[58:37] shall go forth and grow up as calves in
[58:40] the stall and ye shall tread down the
[58:41] wicked for they shall be ashes Under The
[58:44] Souls of your feet in that day that I
[58:46] shall do this sayith the Lord of hosts
[58:48] remember ye the law of Moses my servant
[58:50] which I commanded unto him in Orab for
[58:52] all Israel with the statutes and
[58:54] judgments behold I send uh you Elijah
[58:58] the prophet before the coming of the
[59:00] great and Dreadful day of the Lord and
[59:02] he shall turn the hearts of the fathers
[59:03] to the children and the hearts of the
[59:05] children to their fathers lest I come
[59:07] and smite the Earth with a curse see
[59:09] immediately after the coming of this
[59:11] Elijah the Earth will be cleansed by
[59:13] fire and the wicked burned to
[59:16] ashes of course this did not happen in
[59:19] the time of John Elijah for his day the
[59:22] spirit of God that prophesied the coming
[59:24] of the messenger in Malachi 3:1 which
[59:28] was John what was but reiterating his
[59:32] previous prophetic statement in re in
[59:35] Isaiah 40 and3 made at least three
[59:39] centuries previously the voice of him
[59:42] that crith in the wilderness prepare ye
[59:44] the way of the Lord make straight in the
[59:46] desert a highway for our God now John by
[59:50] the Holy Ghost voiced both Isaiah and
[59:54] Malachi in in Matthew
[59:57] 3:3 for this is he that was spoken of by
[1:00:00] the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of
[1:00:03] one crying in the wilderness prepare ye
[1:00:05] the way of the Lord make his path
[1:00:08] straight so we can so we we can well see
[1:00:13] that from these scriptures that the
[1:00:15] prophet in Malachi 3 who was John was
[1:00:18] not the prophet of Malachi 4 though
[1:00:22] indeed both John and this last day
[1:00:25] prophet
[1:00:26] um have upon them the same Spirit which
[1:00:29] was upon
[1:00:32] Elijah now I want us to just stop there
[1:00:34] for a minute and take a breae because we
[1:00:35] have just read a whole
[1:00:39] bunch are are y'all are y'all seeing the
[1:00:43] picture uh catching the picture of what
[1:00:47] uh of what the spirit of the Lord is
[1:00:49] putting forth in in in putting these
[1:00:52] comparisons together
[1:00:56] so there there have been there there's
[1:01:00] five elijas that have been prophesied to
[1:01:05] come amen There Was Elijah who had the
[1:01:08] spirit of Elijah he was a prophet and I
[1:01:11] want you to I want you to look just just
[1:01:13] for a minute as as brother brandom
[1:01:15] already uh very well placed it out there
[1:01:20] he was against
[1:01:22] Jezebel and and uh and and Jezebel was
[1:01:26] one of those painted faed uh ladies who
[1:01:29] ruled the who ruled the
[1:01:31] kingdom he he he prophesied against Ahab
[1:01:36] amen the the political
[1:01:39] system he was he was the one that
[1:01:43] rebuilt the altar of God it was in the
[1:01:47] evening time that he came by
[1:01:50] vision and he went to the Mount of God
[1:01:54] he didn't take new stones
[1:01:57] the scripture emphatically why the
[1:01:59] scripture is so empat I think I I I
[1:02:01] think we need to look at those
[1:02:02] scriptures when when God is emphatic
[1:02:04] about certain things he didn't tell him
[1:02:06] that he built an altar no he rebuilt the
[1:02:11] altar he took the old Stones put them
[1:02:14] back together Amen in the evening time
[1:02:19] and then it was a showdown between the
[1:02:22] Living God and all of the the the the
[1:02:25] ones that were claiming they were
[1:02:27] Israelites true Jews they were but they
[1:02:31] were not worshiping the true God they
[1:02:35] claimed they were but they
[1:02:37] weren't came to a showdown and then the
[1:02:41] pillar of fire came and and he stood
[1:02:44] there amen and he and and and of course
[1:02:47] we understand that he he gave them up
[1:02:49] till noon telling him worship and he
[1:02:51] says come on get your god get him to
[1:02:54] talk maybe he's on a vacation get him to
[1:02:56] answer and let your God answer by fire
[1:02:58] and vindicate what you believe if if if
[1:03:00] your God will answer by fire then I'll
[1:03:03] follow your God Amen and after he gave
[1:03:06] him all the way up till noon or or or
[1:03:09] gave him all the way up till uh all day
[1:03:12] they they were they were uh screaming
[1:03:14] and they got cutting themselves and and
[1:03:17] and and they they they had worked
[1:03:19] themselves into a frenzy which
[1:03:21] Hallelujah which is a lot like our
[1:03:23] Pentecostal world today Works themselves
[1:03:26] up into a frenzy with the drums and the
[1:03:28] and the music and and and getting
[1:03:30] everything all and and they call that a
[1:03:32] working of the Holy Ghost and but the
[1:03:35] prophet stood there with all of that
[1:03:37] dancing and all of that stuff and he
[1:03:40] would stand there and say that's not the
[1:03:42] god that's not the god of the Bible if
[1:03:45] yours is brother Brandon would would
[1:03:47] would tell him amen come and stand
[1:03:49] beside me come stand beside me amen show
[1:03:53] me in the scripture one thing that I
[1:03:55] that that that I preach whether it's the
[1:03:57] serpent seed or the Oneness of God or
[1:03:59] anything listen
[1:04:01] amen especially in the one that I'm that
[1:04:03] I'm telling you about right now uh the
[1:04:05] brother brother brandham was given a

[1:04:40] him the color of the room and everything
[1:04:42] and then he then he takes him to the
[1:04:44] room and he shows them where all
[1:04:47] everyone is sitting around the room
[1:04:49] shows them exactly where all of these
[1:04:51] preachers and all of these priests and
[1:04:53] everyone is going to be sitting amen and
[1:04:57] and brother brandham and and and it was

[1:05:33] brother brandom says you won't be in
[1:05:34] that room tomorrow and he says well what
[1:05:37] makes you think that he says because
[1:05:40] that room is has got this certain
[1:05:41] certain color he goes yeah yeah we were
[1:05:43] there yeah that's the color he says but
[1:05:45] you're not going to have that you're

[1:05:49] the the the where we're going to be
[1:05:50] meeting is going to be this color of a
[1:05:51] room and he says and not and and and
[1:05:53] then then he began to tell him he said
[1:05:55] so and so is gonna said here and here
[1:05:57] and here and here and here and here and
[1:05:59] and begins to tell them and uh uh so
[1:06:03] when he when when they go that next day
[1:06:06] yes the the the the building was given
[1:06:08] away to somebody else it was double
[1:06:11] booked they were able to go and the one
[1:06:14] that introduced brother brandham to the
[1:06:16] to the meeting this that that that next
[1:06:18] day he says he says y'all can say what
[1:06:22] y'all want to say about brother brandom
[1:06:24] and what you think about his teachings
[1:06:26] and things but he said if that man
[1:06:28] didn't tell me that we weren't going to
[1:06:31] be in that other room just yesterday
[1:06:32] told me that we're not going to be at
[1:06:34] that other building and that we're going
[1:06:36] to be in this building and if that man
[1:06:38] did not tell me where every one of you
[1:06:40] were going to stay where you was going
[1:06:42] to be
[1:06:43] sitting he say I give the floor to
[1:06:45] William
[1:06:47] Brown now they had already set a trap
[1:06:51] they were going to come in and just work
[1:06:54] him over they already had it all put
[1:06:58] together but when brother Ram stood up
[1:07:00] there and he stood up there just just
[1:07:02] really very humbly and and he stands up
[1:07:05] and he says now there's questions here
[1:07:08] if there's anything I want any of you
[1:07:11] guys if you're questioning anything that
[1:07:13] I've that I preach bring your Bible up
[1:07:16] here why don't you show it
[1:07:20] to that was the quietest place you could
[1:07:23] ever imagine those preaches weren't
[1:07:25] going to make a move it was a mount
[1:07:28] carel
[1:07:29] Showdown it was the Living spirit of God
[1:07:32] with all of these other guys claiming
[1:07:34] that they're spiritual and that's the
[1:07:35] reason why I say make sure when you
[1:07:37] claim you're spiritual make sure you're
[1:07:39] spiritual make sure you do it make sure
[1:07:41] you've got clothes that the Holy Spirit
[1:07:44] has given you every one of us we got to
[1:07:46] make sure because only the bride is
[1:07:49] going to be make making herself ready
[1:07:51] for that coming can you say Amen now now
[1:07:53] watch
[1:07:56] Elijah put them to The Showdown over and
[1:08:00] over now so that was the Elijah and we
[1:08:04] can see in that apostate Church what had
[1:08:07] taken
[1:08:08] place number two Elisha was given double
[1:08:14] portion of the spirit of Elijah so that
[1:08:18] was that was Elijah with the spirit of
[1:08:20] God on him then the second one came up
[1:08:22] Elijah has been has been translated amen
[1:08:26] and now the second a man comes up with
[1:08:29] the spirit of Elijah and he done the
[1:08:31] works of God and then the third one how
[1:08:34] many can tell me who the third one
[1:08:37] was John the Baptist that's one we've
[1:08:41] just read about that was the third one
[1:08:42] that had the spirit of Elijah upon him
[1:08:46] and he come to forun the first coming of
[1:08:49] Christ then there's a fourth coming of
[1:08:52] Elijah that has been prophesied to come
[1:08:55] that is our Elijah that will come and
[1:08:58] turn our hearts back to the faith of the
[1:09:03] fathers turn us back to the Bible That's
[1:09:07] the fourth coming of Elijah but then
[1:09:09] there is also a fifth coming of Elijah
[1:09:12] that has been prophesied to come and
[1:09:15] it's going to come uh it's going to be
[1:09:17] to the Jews to restore them back to the
[1:09:23] Christ and just as brother brandom in
[1:09:25] the church age book says and that man
[1:09:27] must that that fourth Elijah must be
[1:09:30] alive and upon the Earth right now I
[1:09:33] want to say the fifth Elijah is on the
[1:09:35] Earth right now I believe that with all
[1:09:38] of my heart amen the fifth Elijah is
[1:09:42] over there somewhere in among them that
[1:09:44] God is already raising up Amen to turn
[1:09:47] the hearts of that 144,000 back to God a
[1:09:52] it's a big it's it's it's it's it's big
[1:09:54] man
[1:09:56] so so we we we can see the
[1:10:00] prophecies so you the fourth Elijah
[1:10:04] which was the Gentile Elijah in the last
[1:10:06] day Malachi 4 is not the same Elijah
[1:10:10] that is to be over there in the Jews
[1:10:13] different men five different men but the
[1:10:17] same anointing with the same
[1:10:20] characteristics are yall are y'all
[1:10:22] understanding
[1:10:23] that now I also uh and I'm I'm fixing to
[1:10:26] open it up for for for any questions and
[1:10:29] and and now listen if there's anything
[1:10:31] that we have read um any I want yall to
[1:10:35] catch this so please ask questions if if
[1:10:39] uh if if you're confused about any of
[1:10:42] this I want you to understand in the
[1:10:46] scripture why we take put such
[1:10:51] preeminence on the word for this last
[1:10:54] day we don't worship William brandham we
[1:10:57] don't I don't baptize in his name he was
[1:11:01] a sinner saved by grace just like I'm a
[1:11:03] sinner saved by grace there is nothing
[1:11:06] about that man that can save me but God
[1:11:09] raised up a natural Elijah that the the
[1:11:12] first Elijah that the world hated they
[1:11:15] tried to kill him but he was God's man
[1:11:20] Elisha the same John the Baptist was
[1:11:23] killed and destroyed uh h w w was killed
[1:11:26] beheaded because he was he was preaching
[1:11:29] against that it's that it's illegal it's
[1:11:31] not right according to scripture for
[1:11:33] Philip to be married uh to his brother's
[1:11:35] wife our Elijah come and the world hated
[1:11:40] his
[1:11:41] message and the fifth Elijah the Bible
[1:11:44] says that they're going to kill him and
[1:11:46] they're going to leave him in the
[1:11:48] streets that's the way the world thinks
[1:11:50] about the spirit of Christ and every one
[1:11:52] of these guys thinking they're
[1:11:53] Christians every one of them that's how
[1:11:55] evil things of God can you say Amen so I
[1:11:59] want us to make sure we know now brother
[1:12:02] uh Harry if you wouldn't
[1:12:03] mind I've got I don't know I
[1:12:07] uh do we have enough I don't I didn't
[1:12:11] Nathaniel do do we have enough to give
[1:12:13] huh there's 40 so anyone that knows how
[1:12:17] to read let's just um now I don't
[1:12:21] uh
[1:12:24] huh okay okay so so anyone that knows
[1:12:26] how to read I want you to take it and I
[1:12:27] want you to study it in your devotional
[1:12:29] time all
[1:12:32] right these books are uh are just little
[1:12:36] booklets and the reason I wanted to get
[1:12:38] it get it in the kids you kids' hands is
[1:12:40] because it's only got a few pages amen
[1:12:44] and um but it talks about the five
[1:12:47] comings of Elijah and so uh and and
[1:12:51] brother what what it is is is brother
[1:12:53] Tim PR um
[1:12:55] put this together and he took he took
[1:12:59] the some of the he took it out of what
[1:13:01] we just read here in the church age book
[1:13:03] and he put it he he put it in there
[1:13:05] where where a person that doesn't know
[1:13:07] much about the message can can just
[1:13:09] really see it easily so we want we we
[1:13:12] want every one of you all to to read
[1:13:14] that and hey I I enjoy reading it myself
[1:13:16] so uh so I'm a big kid amen sister
[1:13:23] Carol that was Elisha
[1:13:27] remember when Elisha was fixing was was
[1:13:30] um fixing to be caught
[1:13:36] up yes yeah he says if you keep he says
[1:13:39] uh what what what you know what can I
[1:13:42] give you he said I want a double portion
[1:13:43] of thy spirit and so um when the mantle
[1:13:48] fell upon him then he
[1:13:51] was um uh
[1:13:56] that that was the Elijah and actually he
[1:13:57] fulfilled the promises that Elijah was
[1:14:00] supposed that that was commanded Elijah
[1:14:02] to fulfill and he did actually uh I
[1:14:06] think there was eight things and Elijah
[1:14:07] done four and um uh but he but uh the
[1:14:11] spirit of the Lord was upon Elisha to
[1:14:13] fulfill that word after he was gone so
[1:14:18] yeah so y'all understanding the the the
[1:14:19] the five comings anyone has anything
[1:14:22] they want to they want to add tonight
[1:14:23] too uh
[1:14:26] go go right go right ahead I would
[1:14:29] like I want to matter of fact we're
[1:14:31] probably going to hit this for the next
[1:14:33] two or three times we're just going to
[1:14:35] get little angles of that Prophet
[1:14:37] messenger because I I I don't want y'all
[1:14:39] to just read this tonight and then be
[1:14:41] gone with it I want this burnt into our
[1:14:43] Spirits this is scripture and I want you
[1:14:47] to know that you
[1:14:49] know there's going to be opinions that
[1:14:52] rise and opinions are like belly buttons
[1:14:54] every everyone's got one and you cannot
[1:14:57] you
[1:14:59] cannot place your salvation upon that
[1:15:03] but when God sends a messenger to this
[1:15:06] age and vindicates that messenger then
[1:15:09] then I think it it it it behooves every
[1:15:12] one of us to take heed to what the
[1:15:16] spirit is saying to the
[1:15:20] church man we've got to do that I've got
[1:15:24] to line my there is no special
[1:15:25] privileges I is Pastor I must line
[1:15:30] everything with my attitudes with my
[1:15:33] belief system with everything I am I've
[1:15:35] got to line it up with that thus sayeth
[1:15:38] the Lord amen I I don't care who you are
[1:15:42] we must line our thoughts up with his
[1:15:47] word and I I I'm just I I I'm not
[1:15:50] questioning anymore I've done a lot of
[1:15:52] studying over these the these last 30s
[1:15:55] something years and I want to say Amen
[1:15:58] I've I've I've went forward and backward
[1:16:01] and i' I've I've studied and I Hey
[1:16:04] listen I was a Pentecostal boy I was one
[1:16:06] of those sign Seekers I was one of those
[1:16:08] with miracles in my life I was one amen
[1:16:11] that I hey I was a talented uh I was a
[1:16:16] talented preacher kid and and uh but but
[1:16:21] that that wasn't God's desire for me
[1:16:24] amen a talented preacher kid was not
[1:16:26] what God wanted God wanted me to have
[1:16:29] that Revelation in my heart concerning
[1:16:32] him can you say amen amen and that's the
[1:16:35] way we all want to we want to make sure
[1:16:38] amen that our faith is built upon that
[1:16:41] all right any any questions any other
[1:16:44] questions here brother brother murl
[1:17:08] yeah hey can can y'all turn turn turn
[1:17:10] the house speakers up so so or the
[1:17:13] internet speakers so that uh others can
[1:17:16] hear
[1:17:17] these yeah yeah that yeah and
[1:17:33] thousand though all the propes were
[1:17:36] perfect and th
[1:17:44] Lord was 100% correct yeah I heard that
[1:17:49] many thousands burnt their books turned
[1:17:53] their backs on the message at the end of
[1:17:56] 1977 believing that was going to be the
[1:18:00] end yeah and that the Rapture would take
[1:18:03] place by the end of
[1:18:05] 1977 yeah but God never corrected him no
[1:18:10] there's many times God did correct the
[1:18:12] prophet oh I I would have said that
[1:18:14] wrong I said that wrong the holy spirit
[1:18:17] is correcting me on that we've heard it
[1:18:19] on tape yeah you know sure but God let
[1:18:23] that go and I believe he let it go for a
[1:18:25] reason that's right it's to shake it's
[1:18:29] to shake off the the uh the make
[1:18:31] believer amen unbelievable it's God let
[1:18:35] lets these things be done for a reason
[1:18:37] is what I'm what I'm saying yeah and he
[1:18:40] he didn't correct it because he didn't
[1:18:43] feel the need to correct it uh that that
[1:18:47] prediction and uh well as you were
[1:18:50] saying at the begin at at the beginning
[1:18:52] of your statement that Jesus Jus himself
[1:18:55] said unless you drink my blood and eat
[1:19:00] my flesh you will have no part in
[1:19:03] me he didn't explain
[1:19:06] it he didn't do any it and his multitude
[1:19:11] the scripture says who can hear this
[1:19:16] saying so when we when we look back and
[1:19:19] and there were many things that's went
[1:19:21] went off from that you know many many
[1:19:25] things were were said and and and
[1:19:27] fractions went different directions in
[1:19:29] jesus' day when brother brandham
[1:19:32] said I predict not
[1:19:36] prophesy but yet in
[1:19:40] 1977 there was there there was a
[1:19:44] uh a a lot of
[1:19:49] people well-meaning
[1:19:52] preachers but they weren't rightly
[1:19:55] dividing they they they had sort of
[1:19:58] shifted everything on brother brandham
[1:20:01] put everything making brother brandham
[1:20:04] as if as deifying him when brother
[1:20:08] brandham very tically
[1:20:12] said that this is not what God's told me
[1:20:15] I'm basing it on on the visions that I
[1:20:18] have seen and them coming to pass I'm
[1:20:20] basing it on all of this around me and
[1:20:24] he was given that 77 to make sure or or
[1:20:28] to let us know what he thought that we
[1:20:30] are really that
[1:20:32] close but then others put it and started
[1:20:37] uh putting it as no it's got to happen
[1:20:40] and there were people that that that uh
[1:20:42] didn't go to work they sewed their cars
[1:20:45] they I mean they they left everything
[1:20:48] and we're waiting and see that's the
[1:20:52] Bible says to work till he comes
[1:20:55] that's that's that's part of
[1:21:01] it bought all this stuff because they
[1:21:04] thought I'm not that's true I've heard
[1:21:06] of that where they went and got got in
[1:21:08] major major debt because they're not
[1:21:10] going to need it anymore anyways and uh
[1:21:13] uh and and and and they were and and so
[1:21:16] then the scoffers then many laughed and
[1:21:18] said well we can follow no
[1:21:20] more but brother brandom in the opening
[1:21:22] of The Seven Seals he said says don't
[1:21:25] make a big deal of this he says if I
[1:21:28] knew that the Lord was coming
[1:21:31] tomorrow if I knew the Lord was coming
[1:21:34] tomorrow I would be up tonight preparing
[1:21:38] my service for tomorrow
[1:21:40] morning I would if if if I knew he was
[1:21:42] coming on the work I would go to work I
[1:21:44] would do everything I'm supposed to do
[1:21:47] until he
[1:21:49] comes but yet we're preparing for his
[1:21:52] coming y'all see that now there's a lot
[1:21:55] of people that are out but but we but
[1:21:57] but you can't you you you can't be harsh
[1:22:00] on people that that tell you that well
[1:22:01] brother Brandon missed his prophecies
[1:22:03] because all they're getting their stuff
[1:22:05] from is the internet all they're getting
[1:22:06] their stuff from and they're Liars they
[1:22:09] are liars and the Bible says there even
[1:22:12] in in the Apostle Paul call them yellow
[1:22:16] bellies he he call them
[1:22:19] liars and and and because they were
[1:22:21] lying they were lying on on the ministry
[1:22:24] of that day and so they're doing the
[1:22:27] same thing today with greater deceit
[1:22:28] because of the internet this the reason
[1:22:30] why it's called the the dark
[1:22:33] web yeah so I I I that that is very true
[1:22:38] glad you brought that up there there
[1:22:39] were there there was uh many many many
[1:22:44] many that that that thought that it's it
[1:22:47] was over and um shows their hearts
[1:22:51] weren't right they weren't working and
[1:22:52] they were they were putting they were
[1:22:54] putting things you know going into major
[1:22:57] debt and and it just it just wasn't by
[1:22:59] divine
[1:23:00] revelation
[1:23:02] amen anyone else and and I cut you off
[1:23:06] there brother Merl if you
[1:23:15] okay there was also a lot of people that
[1:23:17] left when the prophet left the scene
[1:23:20] yeah that just crushed them maybe you
[1:23:24] know yeah it was it was gone at that
[1:23:28] point
[1:23:31] and you know it's he said it would be a
[1:23:34] short
[1:23:36] age and a lot of people you know when I
[1:23:40] came into the message I came in even
[1:23:42] later than brother murl and you know I
[1:23:45] was told that you would need to get
[1:23:47] married you would need to to do anything
[1:23:50] you know you wouldn't have need to have
[1:23:51] kids and and that kind of thing and and
[1:23:55] um because it you know all this stuff
[1:23:57] had happened and was pretty much over
[1:24:00] but um you know and the shortest age was
[1:24:05] in I was talking to brother wend the
[1:24:08] other day about it
[1:24:10] was the Ephesian age was 123 years
[1:24:15] long and so I I that something just
[1:24:19] didn't sit right after a long time of
[1:24:22] hearing that this was going to be the
[1:24:24] shortest age and because you wouldn't
[1:24:27] know the
[1:24:28] time and so in 1906 if you had 123 years
[1:24:32] to that it's n or
[1:24:37] 2029 would be the
[1:24:40] last would it would be over before then
[1:24:45] and so here we are
[1:24:49] 2025 you know all this stuff is
[1:24:53] happening my confusion
[1:24:59] is the fourth to the
[1:25:02] fifth uh Prophet the one dies in the
[1:25:06] street and get killed in the street is
[1:25:09] all all the stuff's happening in Israel
[1:25:13] right now and Middle East
[1:25:16] and you know just so much to it that
[1:25:20] that the prophet talked about that's
[1:25:22] coming to pass right now
[1:25:25] and and you know have you really thought
[1:25:27] about it that there's that this that
[1:25:28] this has been that's been going on there
[1:25:32] could be a Revival that's that that
[1:25:34] that's that's beginning to break out or
[1:25:37] has even already broke out there among
[1:25:38] that those
[1:25:41] 144,000
[1:25:43] Israel's Israel's got a lot of
[1:25:46] perversions people fly into Israel from
[1:25:48] all over the world for their
[1:25:51] sin and uh me their
[1:25:56] homosexualality is is is uh is
[1:26:00] celebrated pretty heavy there's a lot of
[1:26:03] stuff over there so God so you you you
[1:26:07] don't know what God is doing to bring
[1:26:10] the elect to desperation over there too
[1:26:13] so that they will hear their profit you
[1:26:15] see what I'm saying that that's going to
[1:26:17] be so we don't we we don't understand a
[1:26:20] whole lot of things but the Revival
[1:26:23] God's promised that r bival to the to to
[1:26:25] the Jews and listen we we fight hey
[1:26:29] satan fights hard fighting the elect the
[1:26:32] way the the the way that he fights us
[1:26:35] it's because the the spirit of the Lord
[1:26:37] is is lifted is lifting from from from
[1:26:40] the Western world and it's going back to
[1:26:42] the
[1:26:42] Jews and um there is a cry in their
[1:26:46] hearts so I I I believe I I I believe
[1:26:50] that that fifth Elijah is going to have
[1:26:52] a very uh short work you know and there
[1:26:56] will be a a a a revealing of Christ to
[1:27:00] to the Jews but when that
[1:27:03] happens we got to be in the
[1:27:05] palace amen we we've got to be there so
[1:27:09] when things when things take place when
[1:27:11] we're when we're raptured out of here
[1:27:12] and and and the tribulation sets in man
[1:27:16] it's it's it's going to be an incredible
[1:27:18] it's going to be an incredible thing
[1:27:22] amen anyone a Kobe
[1:27:31] Maria no no you you help us all put me
[1:27:35] on the spot and I look I'm the one looks
[1:27:37] the the dummy I might have dismissed it
[1:27:39] but um back to the trumpets I I was
[1:27:42] saying like the seven trumpet was like
[1:27:45] the seven messers message so I must be
[1:27:48] wrong about that when you were talking
[1:27:50] about so I don't
[1:27:52] know well the and and no that that that
[1:27:55] is that is good the the
[1:28:00] trumpets are to the
[1:28:03] Jews the
[1:28:05] seals are to the
[1:28:07] bride so so you remember when brother
[1:28:10] brandham was going to go preach the the
[1:28:13] seven trumpets and he already had he
[1:28:16] already had the building rented he
[1:28:17] already had the um people had vacations
[1:28:21] and things but he just kept feeling it
[1:28:23] just wasn't right something was
[1:28:25] something was wrong and um so when he
[1:28:29] and and and then he just he he canceled
[1:28:31] it and then when he went in to ask the
[1:28:33] Lord why uh you know why was this
[1:28:37] happening and then the Lord revealed to
[1:28:39] him said no the trumpets were under that
[1:28:42] six seal see it was UN it was it it was
[1:28:46] it was the messenger to uh it's a
[1:28:50] tribulation it it was under the
[1:28:52] tribulation and the Jews uh seal there
[1:28:55] so now there is a lot of Correspondence
[1:28:58] when you if you listening to the to to
[1:29:00] the um the Feast of the trumpets uh you
[1:29:04] will hear Brother brandham talking about
[1:29:06] how how it correlates how that they had
[1:29:08] their seals basically they had their
[1:29:10] seals like we had our seals and he'll
[1:29:12] correlate he'll correlate that Sixth and
[1:29:14] the seventh together so that may be
[1:29:16] where you're where you're hearing that
[1:29:18] as well but it's it's the um but it's
[1:29:25] and this this brother brandham didn't
[1:29:27] say this um but just just catching the
[1:29:31] bits and pieces and and and please don't
[1:29:33] take this as Doctrine but when brother
[1:29:35] when when when you read when you see the
[1:29:38] different places in the New Testament or
[1:29:40] or in in the Book of Revelations about
[1:29:42] the seven angels because you're going to
[1:29:43] hear that on on different
[1:29:46] occasions um first AG second third
[1:29:49] fourth these these Heavenly beings I
[1:29:52] believe they're just seven heavenly
[1:29:54] beings period but they were but they
[1:29:57] were ministering to to to the bride
[1:30:02] those will be ministering to to the uh
[1:30:05] to to the Jews you see what I'm saying
[1:30:09] now you know brother brandham didn't say
[1:30:10] that but I I I I I just I sort of
[1:30:13] believe that that's you know that's the
[1:30:16] way it is they're ministering to the
[1:30:19] Earthly Messengers here on Earth did
[1:30:22] that did that make any sense
[1:30:25] amen now I and and anyone else have any
[1:30:28] comments that's that's even a better
[1:30:30] answer than mine uh make sure you make
[1:30:33] sure you do that but but the the
[1:30:34] trumpets belong to the
[1:30:37] Jews
[1:30:42] so brother Donald let me get this
[1:30:45] yeah well we just we we just want those
[1:30:49] those that are ask asking questions or
[1:30:51] those that are listening in
[1:30:55] well that's all
[1:31:03] right out there and yeah mercy of God I
[1:31:08] thank him for not only saving me but
[1:31:11] bringing me into the message amen it's a
[1:31:13] gradual thing you know Pentecost Etc and
[1:31:17] back came from Baptist Baptist yeah
[1:31:20] Pentecost the Baptist didn't satisfy me
[1:31:22] I was hungrier for more than neighbor
[1:31:23] were given me you know yeah so the
[1:31:26] hunger and there was a prophecy one time
[1:31:29] and I know all prophecy is not of God
[1:31:30] but my uh uh someone had told my dad
[1:31:33] when he was alive you know because it
[1:31:35] was because of my dad I came in yeah he

[1:36:28] apologize for keeping the service so
[1:36:30] lengthy but I I enjoyed it tonight did
[1:36:32] y'all enjoy
[1:36:38] it and I also um I I I
[1:36:43] appreciate uh you know those like
[1:36:47] brother Merl sister Leah and um uh
[1:36:52] brother Mitch MD Donald you know the the
[1:36:55] ones that even way back there that was
[1:36:59] that was there in the 77 and and around
[1:37:01] that
[1:37:02] area
[1:37:04] and and that's the reason
[1:37:07] why I have always tried my
[1:37:11] best to make sure that yall know that
[1:37:14] we're not following a personality we're
[1:37:16] not following William
[1:37:19] brandham the man we're following his man
[1:37:23] message brother brandham can't save you
[1:37:26] there's just no way jesz and if you
[1:37:29] listen to brother
[1:37:31] brandham you'll have a very clearcut
[1:37:34] view of
[1:37:35] Calvary if you just take the words of
[1:37:39] what brother brandom saying don't
[1:37:41] worship
[1:37:42] him but I am telling you God didn't say
[1:37:47] in the days of the
[1:37:49] voice of many
[1:37:52] Messengers was going to one Prophet
[1:37:55] messenger
[1:37:57] one not many
[1:37:59] one and it's
[1:38:01] important it's
[1:38:03] important to
[1:38:06] listen to take heed because if you do
[1:38:09] listen with a real Earnest
[1:38:11] heart you'll see Calvary really
[1:38:18] beautifully I still believe in tongues
[1:38:20] and interpretation that
[1:38:24] I'm not I'm not looking at them like I
[1:38:26] used to in
[1:38:29] Pentecost I still believe in
[1:38:32] dreams as brother Donald was
[1:38:35] saying and I
[1:38:37] do I do believe the spirit of the
[1:38:40] Lord I I I I believe that that there was
[1:38:44] a Pentecostal I Just sh just share you a
[1:38:46] story that just happened to me while I
[1:38:47] was in that when when we took a break I
[1:38:50] I I felt the re release in my spirit and
[1:38:52] I I
[1:38:54] I I Presa was so good to just while we
[1:38:58] were away to just give me
[1:39:04] time and so I came to her one afternoon
[1:39:06] and I said would you you want to you
[1:39:08] want to go out
[1:39:11] go we can go walking down the landing
[1:39:14] over there and
[1:39:15] braning and she said sure So it was it

[1:39:26] down through all those shops there in at

[1:39:30] it was a pretty
[1:39:32] day and
[1:39:34] uh I had looked at some skirts and you

[1:40:03] shop and and I said you know go look in
[1:40:06] there see see what they have in bolos
[1:40:08] you know so we went in and they had some
[1:40:11] beautiful bolos and we're looking
[1:40:14] and this little woman comes
[1:40:19] up you know she's got cut hair she's an
[1:40:21] older lady
[1:40:24] and uh she's just really interested in
[1:40:28] us she's
[1:40:30] just and
[1:40:33] uh she said you know looking at the
[1:40:35] Bolos she said you know my my dad used
[1:40:37] to wear a bolo whereever Wednesday night
[1:40:39] to
[1:40:41] church I said you know I wear bolos to
[1:40:45] church and usually it's on Wednesday
[1:40:47] night and she goes I knew it I knew said
[1:40:52] oh really
[1:40:55] she
[1:40:57] says pastors really get weary don't
[1:41:04] they yes ma'am little you know we're
[1:41:07] talking he said but my
[1:41:10] dad my dad labored
[1:41:13] hard she La he labored I remember so she
[1:41:17] started telling me about her dad telling
[1:41:20] us
[1:41:24] and I I thought well that's really nice
[1:41:27] so I was ready to get away you know I
[1:41:30] was ready to get
[1:41:31] away and
[1:41:38] uh other people were around she she went
[1:41:41] to go
[1:41:42] help we were trying to sneak out the
[1:41:45] door and that b tie that I wore last
[1:41:51] Wednesday he had it in a box
[1:41:54] she met us at the door and stuck it in
[1:41:55] Fresa's hands she said the Lord told me
[1:41:58] to give this to your
[1:42:00] husband and that he is very mindful of
[1:42:05] him and I turned around and I looked at
[1:42:08] her and I the Bowa was expensive and I
[1:42:11] [Music]
[1:42:12] said I can't do that she said oh yes you
[1:42:15] can I was impressed of the Lord to do
[1:42:18] that for
[1:42:20] you we left
[1:42:23] I waited until everyone the store had
[1:42:26] emptied and I came back in and I
[1:42:28] said you know I I pray that God blesses
[1:42:34] you she said the blessing was upon
[1:42:38] me he said but the Lord dealt with my
[1:42:42] heart and told me to tell you that and
[1:42:45] to give that to
[1:42:47] you Pentecostal
[1:42:54] right Spirit of the Lord still works and
[1:42:57] moves he can use who he
[1:42:59] wants but that little something over
[1:43:01] there way out nowhere and here I'm I've
[1:43:05] been calling out to the God for two
[1:43:07] weeks
[1:43:08] [Music]
[1:43:13] just talking to him very raw very raw
[1:43:18] just pouring my gut pouring everything
[1:43:22] I've got out to and telling
[1:43:28] him and God was so good to
[1:43:31] me all I could do was just
[1:43:36] weep God was
[1:43:40] mindful of
[1:43:46] wend God's mindful of us
[1:43:49] all and I believe the spirit of the Lord
[1:43:52] is very mindful and so I do believe I do
[1:43:55] believe that people
[1:43:57] hear I do believe that God
[1:44:01] speaks well that lady was very accurate
[1:44:04] in in in in dealing with some of the
[1:44:06] things that was in my
[1:44:12] heart but in all of the
[1:44:19] goodness there's only one prophet
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:26] and I've got to line myself myself
[1:44:30] up and that's what we all want to do see
[1:44:34] I was with you brother Donald I remember
[1:44:36] sitting right I I'd go to church I'd go
[1:44:38] to
[1:44:40] church day after day in the daytime I
[1:44:43] ride my bike over there I'd sat right
[1:44:45] outside the pastor's study and I'd ask
[1:44:47] God give me a
[1:44:50] word and it was incredible brother Bur
[1:44:53] would
[1:44:54] come service he' called me out tell me
[1:44:57] things that only God
[1:45:00] knew he had a
[1:45:03] [Music]
[1:45:05] gift but he wasn't the
[1:45:09] prophet you understand what I'm saying
[1:45:11] so we line everything
[1:45:14] up with a Vindicated voice to this
[1:45:19] generation has there been many other
[1:45:21] things that have been brought yeah I've
[1:45:23] had many of other things many other
[1:45:25] prophecies and they I've just had to put
[1:45:28] them on a
[1:45:29] shelf but it's never hurt my faith not
[1:45:32] since I understand since I've come to
[1:45:34] this understanding I don't put my faith
[1:45:36] in Prophecy I put my faith in
