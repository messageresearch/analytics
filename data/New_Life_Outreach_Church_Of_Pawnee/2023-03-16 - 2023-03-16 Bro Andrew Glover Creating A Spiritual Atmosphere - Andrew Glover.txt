that has told us that before there was a desire there was a creation to satisfy there was a Creator to satisfy the desire of the creation amen before there was a fin on a fish's back there was a water for the fish to swim in before there was a tree with apples or fruit or whatever kind of tree there was a Earth for the tree to grow out of and amen I believe before there was a desire in your heart to receive the Holy Ghost there was a holy ghost for you to receive and then before there was a desire for a miracle there was a creator that could perform a miracle amen I don't believe our God has sent us into this generation unprepared but he is our preparation this evening and I don't think we've come to these meetings unprepared but I believe there's a how many can feel the charge of expectation in the atmosphere amen something pulsating in your heart that Jesus Christ is alive and well heard City would do just as her deserve in that softly tonight let's just buy our hearts together and let's just humble our Spirits in his presence this evening and I know we've driven many miles traveled a long time to get here this evening but on this first night would you just join

me pray tonight Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here on the first night of this Youth Camp Lord father we're not Gathering here out of a tradition or out of a ritual but Lord we're gathered here because we're hungry father we're thirsting for you lord lord there's a deep calling to the Deep Lord there's something on the inside of us that's calling out for more or we don't just want more religion we don't just want more ideas but Lord we're wanting to experience the Living God and Lord we know that there is many gods in this world there's the god of fashion there's the god of sports there's the god of Hollywood the world is full of gods but Lord there is only one true and living God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and that is you tonight father so Lord as we open these services tonight we want to place you as the preeminent one Among Us Lord we want to invite you to come into these meetings Lord each song that sung every word that's spoken Lord every sermon that's preached ever ever a man that is echoed out Lord may you be the preeminence of it Lord father may you come in this room and change hearts and lives as only you can do may you drive out ever spirit it's unlike the Holy Spirit here tonight and may you send the angels of God into this building Lord your Prophet told us that whenever Believers come together there's a great Warfare that takes place he said the word of God is trying to come into the hearts of the people but the demons are trying to beset the word in every way they can he said but one is the majority in God so Lord as I look across this building tonight there's more than one here but Lord there's a whole house full of Believers young men young ladies Lord Elders here father that can join their faith together and they can drive every devil or that's in this room back to the hill that it come out of Lord may you fill this room with the supernatural may you come in here Lord for those that are sick May healing take preeminence in their bodies for those that are bound dear God may you break the chains Lord father we're not coming for just another Youth Camp but Lord we're coming to entertain the angel of the Lord we're coming to entertain your presence for Lord in your presence is the possibility for a change Lord we could reconsecrate ourselves to you we surrender our to you tonight use this for your honor and glory and Lord may we not leave this Camp the way we came but may we begin this very moment this very first service Lord may your spirit begin to mold us and begin to shape us dear God for Lord we're fixing to leave here in a Rapture one day our bodies are going to be changed one day Lord we want to be in preparation for that great hour bless your children here tonight I pray in the name of Jesus Christ we ask these things and all the Believers says and amen how many believers do we have here tonight amen amen then wherever Believers are something good is bound to happen amen amen we walk tonight to invite you in your scriptures we want to turn to the book of Acts the second chapter the book of Acts the second chapter and while you're turning there this evening we do want to take this opportunity to greet you on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we sure counted an honor a privilege to be here with you all again this year and we do appreciate brother Wendell and the church here for the efforts in these camps to put forth all the work and amen I believe we're here expecting a good time amen and I know one person attend for a hurt and that's the devil amen because I believe the Lord is already moving among us and we want to say we appreciate the opportunity to be speaking with brother Andrew Spencer again this year and we say God bless him and his family and sure glad to have my wife and our little baby Malachi here if you haven't seen him just hold on you'll hear him uh he's here with us tonight we're sure glad to have them here with us and amen I kind of when brother Wendell was asking about that cold weather I looked over at brother Nathan and he's the only one I could think of that's responsible for bringing that from the cold North well I guess the rest of Ohio people are but amen we sure appreciate brother Nathan I know they left real early this morning and drove all driven all day to get here and just come in for service time and we appreciate him for bringing the youth group and all the pastors and youth ministers here that are represented we say God bless you all this evening and we just want to look here in the word for a few moments I know you're tired but we're going to speak to you here from acts the second chapter we want to look in the first verse of Acts the second chapter and the very first verse I know you all know these scriptures by heart the Bible says when the day if Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a Russian Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared in them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all Fields somebody say field they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen we asked the Lord this evening that you had the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to for just a few moments by the help of the Lord if I would title this sermon tonight I want to speak to you on just a simple thought here of creating a spiritual atmosphere creating a spiritual atmosphere and I believe that we have come here this weekend to have a spiritual meeting amen and I believe if we're going to have a spiritual meeting then we've got to have a spiritual atmosphere if you're going to have a natural meeting then a natural atmosphere will be okay if you're going to have an intellectual meeting then an intellectual atmosphere will be okay but we've come here amen for a spiritual meeting and we must have a spiritual atmosphere now the prophet of God actually would say in Tulsa Oklahoma 1960 in a prayer he says Wake the people up to a spiritual atmosphere he said oh it takes that to bring children into the kingdom he said it takes the spiritual atmosphere again and is there anything too hard for the Lord he said that's the way the Christian ought to do today is keep yourself prayed up under a spiritual atmosphere always see never seen the bad side but looking to the good side amen because you are children of God expecting His blessings amen never looking to the bad side never looking to the negative if never looking to what has gone wrong what is going wrong or what could go wrong amen but always looking at the positive because when you see the positive you know the one that is a competent the positive is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ so and then we're not looking to the negative we're not looking to doubt we're not looking to ideas we're looking to the positive and the positive is Jesus Christ and because we are looking to him there is an expectation that is in the heart of every believer remember said just as you expect amen that's what you're going to get how many agrees with me what you expect is exactly what you're going to get but if you come to the meeting expecting to see the glory of God moving the power of God Sinners being saved filled with the holy ghost sickness being healed amen then watch what God shows you if you come here amen expecting to see the glory of God he will show you his glory if you come here expecting to receive a healing in your body amen he will give you the healing in your body if you come you're expecting to receive the Holy Ghost amen he still gives the Holy Ghost one ever you come here tonight amen expecting God to do he is the same yesterday amen today and forever well brother Andrew I've tried before we'll try again amen I I tried one time and I didn't get very far we'll try again because we serve a God Amen that does not give up he does not give in amen he does not come up against our position and say well it's too hard I don't think we can overcome amen but there's a word for every one of us here tonight and that is persevere amen if you need the Holy Ghost I challenge you to persevere this weekend if you need Deliverance I challenge you to persevere if you need a miracle I challenge you to persevere amen if there's an old besetting sin and a habit amen that has attached itself to your life I challenge you by the authority of the Holy Ghost persevere amen and God will give you Deliverance he will give you the miracle he will give you the answer he will give you the Breakthrough amen because he is God and what his word said he would do he is here to do that's why we need a spiritual atmosphere I believe amen that there's a hunger in the heart of every young person sitting here tonight and that is a hunger for the supernatural how many beliefs in the Supernatural you you know what Supernatural it's something that transcends or transceeds Amen to natural and we are hungry for the supernatural now it takes a spiritual atmosphere Amen to feed the hunger for the supernatural let him say without one fear to know that I have to answer it that day of judgment if I make this statement because he's here he said I feel him I see the reaction of his word to them that's filled with the spirit they're children of God he said they eat not the bread alone but by the words it proceeds out of the mouth of God when the word Goes Forth the hungry children say thank you Father thank you Father oh I love you father he said I love you brother I said eating not only he meant biscuits and grits and brown gravy but they're feeding on the Eternal Word of God filling their soul with a spiritual atmosphere amen then the atmosphere is not just coming in the church he meant by the music that's being played amen the atmosphere is not just coming in the church amen by the people that's here amen but the atmosphere comes in the church by the word amen and as you feed on the word you will become the word and as the word comes into your heart amen the word will satisfy the desire for the supernatural let me just go ahead and say this we are not following a natural message we are not falling a natural idea but we are following a supernatural God and he is restored and revealed the full word and that word is coming to the church amen it's not come just to make us feel good it's not come just to make us have a better approach Amen to a scripture than somebody else amen but this message has come into this generation Amen to release a supernatural attribute on the inside of every believer listen I'm telling young people you're not just young people you're not just church members you are a supernatural generation who has received a supernatural side among you are a supernatural people we are not falling a natural God we are falling a supernatural God he still opens Red Seas he still opens blinded eyes he still gives the Holy Ghost he still tears the laws of Jericho now everything is words that he would do you didn't come up short amen because you're living in laodicea but he's still God and he's just looking for somebody who will let him come into their heart by the revelation of the word that they're living in the age and let that word feed that desire to see the supernatural I say oh God come in here this weekend Lord and feed our hungry Hearts feed it with the supernatural feed us with Revelation fetus with stimulation of Revelation come in our hearts Lord and feed us with the supernatural bread see they're hungry and her Desiring amen a spiritual atmosphere then if we are Desiring that spiritual atmosphere amen then there's coming amen a Revival to the desire amen there's coming an answer to the question let's come in a breakthrough to the bondage let's come in a miracle to the situation listen you are not here tonight amen under some worked up in motion I can't lay a foundation for preaching you're not here under some work that promotion you have been LED here by Jesus Christ who is the same yesterday today and forever and God does not lead you somewhere without there being something to satisfy amen the desire he's leading you by I say oh God come in the building this weekend and revive us revive us from the youngest to the oldest amen revive us from the most revelated Amen to the newest member I say like David will thou not revive us again amen that thou people may rejoice in thee amen we're not rejoicing in just the ideas of a man we are rejoicing in the revelation of the word that's been revealed in the age we're living remember said if you neglect to satisfy thirst for water or food you will die and if you neglect that first and you for God you will spiritually die he said you call for revivals amen you wait for your church to have a Revival well that ain't the Revival for you oh no the Revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for god listen friends you think the Revival started when you put on the parking lot and you got in the building and you sit down amen but in reality the Revival started amen when something in your heart said I gotta get to Oklahoma I gotta get in those meetings I gotta get into the spouts where the Shekinah glorious Point amen something began to pulsate in your heart come on church amen that was not a campfire drawing you and then that was not a preacher amen probing at you to get down here but it was a Revival amen that is here for you to receive I know some of y'all need a Revival amen some of us need a refreshing some of us need to renew it and I'll tell you the only way it's going to come it'll come by the supernatural World they've been coming into our souls and feeding our souls the word the Revival ought to begin right in you when you begin to thirst for God there might not be another member of the church amen wanting that Revival but if it breaks out in you oh come on if it breaks out in you he said it'll break out in other places I say oh God let a Revival break out here this weekend that'll burn in every Church it'll burn in every home it'll burn in every school I'ma we're not just coming down here once a year amen to get a little bit of excitement and a little bit of emotion amen but I believe we can receive something here this weekend that'll carry us from time back into eternity I believe we can gather here this weekend and receive a visitation from the almighty God and it'll take us through every trial it'll take us to every disappointment it'll take us through every hard time because there's a word and it's an anchoring word it's a word of Revival listen if we're going to have that Revival then we got to get in the spirit of Revival if we're going to have Revival we got to get in the spirit of Revival you know brother I'm saying if you're going to have a dance you got to get in the spirit of dancing if you're going to have a ball game you got to get in the spirit of the ball game he said then we can never have a Revival Amen in Shreveport or anywhere else until the church gets in the spirit of the Revival until the church gets in the spirit of Revival God can come and perform Miracles he can sow under stretch forth his hand he can heal the sick and The Afflicted and the preacher can preach the gospel as hard as he can but they'll never be a Revival until the church gets in the spirit of Revival then what is Revival a Revival is an improvement in the condition or strength of something in the religious sense it is The Reawakening of a religious fervor now look how the world defines Revival especially by a series of Evangelistic meetings amen so the world's idea of a Revival amen is get a bunch of people together amen have a special preacher sing a few songs and that's a Revival but the Prophet come in this age and said that's not a Revival that's a protractive meeting he said that's just the ability he meant to get a crowd of people together he said see but a true Revival is not a false Revival it's a true Revival now you know what you know there's true and false revivals right amen there's a false Revival and a false Revival comes amen when you try to move the people apart from the word you get a false Revival when you try to move the church apart from the lord well I'm here some might as well preach amen you get a false Revival when you try to move the people into a higher Dimension with God apart from this message amen you can only go as high as the message and the age you're living in and this message well I'm going to preach amen this message is not a better idea this message is not a book on the Shelf it's not something you should just play at night when you can't go to sleep and you need to hear amen and saw a holy voice amen this message is your guy this message is your compass if you want to get out of layout to see you you better get under this message if you want to see the future home you better get out of this message this message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and I refuse Amen to let some devil reduce this message amen down to just a bunch of people sitting around amen arguing about how God used to move I propose to you that what God used to do he's right here this weekend to do he was God in Jeffersonville he was God in Arizona he was caught in Canada but he's God right here in Oklahoma this weekend and he's here to confirm his word by the power of this word by the reality of Jesus Christ coming in this room will confirm this message is more than a man it's more than an idea it's the voice of God this message is the saith the Lord now you say brother Andrew we got to move the people well we can't do it with the message well maybe the message you're preaching he can't but the message I'm preaching emptied seven truckloads full of wheelchairs well brother Andrew we can't move the people with a message well the message I'm preaching went around the world seven times and was never defeated once see a false Revival comes by trying to move the people apart from the word amen but now watch a true Revival comes by people coming back to the word the prophets should every fresh and true Revival will be because men have gotten back to the word for their age from the very first book in the Bible Genesis to the last book of Revelation there is only one reason for God's displeasure and that is leaving the word and there's only one remedy to regain his favor is to come back to the word then the word is the anchor or the absolute or the typos to this generation without this word we don't have a Revival without this message you're wasting your time here this weekend amen listen if we lay this message aside we should have spent our money to go to Dollywood we should have spent our money to go to California or go to Disney World Without this message this is another building you're another young person I'm another person picture but if this message is a truth and it comes into this Dimension it's just not just a youth camp this is not just another bunch of preachers it's just not just a bunch of young people this is Rapture and Faith it's Rapture and Grace it's Rapture anointing it's the releasing of the prisoners from the bondage of the slave owner it's the releasing of Liberty and healing it listen I want to say it as plain as I can this message is nothing but the resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ confirming his presence confirming his actions listen he's still moving he's still healing he's still saving he's still delivered we are not looking for a Revival we are the Revival we're not looking for the word we have become the word a true Revival comes when men will get back to the word for their age come on church we got to get back to what a prophet tone I don't care what you I don't care what your favorite grandma said favorite preacher favorite Almanac favorite and then you got to get back to what a prophet said it's the only thing that'll stand when two hundred thousand thousand demons are surrounding your life is what a prophet is taught it's the only thing that will break through in the night seasons and give you a Revival is what a prophet is saying listen we've had all kinds of revivals I I pray this is okay we've had all kinds of revivals remember to say we've had denominational revivals we've had church revivals we've had man-made revivals intellectual revivals yet in all those revivals he says we haven't had a Revival yet in all the revivals we haven't had a Revival yet he said we talk about Revival but we ain't had no Revival yet he said we've had a lot of protracted meetings then you come over to 1963 in the third seal he said that's the reason today that the revivals were supposed to have we haven't had a real stirring he said we have denominational revivals but we haven't had a real stirring no no don't think we got revivals we haven't oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members amen but not a Revival no nowhere see the bride hasn't had a Revival yet amen see there's been no Revival there now watch what he says no manifestation of God Amen to stir the bride see we're looking for it it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there Amen to wake her up amen he will send it he promised it he said now she was dead I know sometimes people say well brother Andrew you got to be careful about preaching to young people but you see you got the wrong guy up here amen because I know that we got young people sitting here tonight a minute can build computers they can build programs they can build software amen if they can build something for the devil then don't tell me they can't understand this message don't tell me they cannot walk in the revelation of the age that they're Live come on if you was living in Luther's day and went to a camp in those days they weren't talking about little stories they were saying what Luther said if you was living in the days of Wesley and you went to a camp they weren't talking about some little something they were talking about what Wesley said and we are living in the age when the seventh angel has resounded the voice of God and the bride has been called from the confusion listen young people it's time to get your hand amen out of YouTube and out of all this nonsense and get your head back and when a prophet said get your head back in them tapes get your life it'll change you it'll break the habits off of you you're tired of emotional roller coasters get in this message you're tired of being up one day and down the next get in this message it's an atmosphere it's a living Supernatural breathing [Applause] just a bunch of quotes it's a living reality it's what woke them right up it's what give revision he said now she was dead now now the product God said see they have not recognized amen The Awakening of the Bride they've not recognized The Awakening of the Bride he said see so the bride's Revival amen is a manifestation of God remember I said I feel that God has brought us the message and I believe we're at the end of the road and I believe the hour is here for the manifestation of God to be made known Among Us I believe the hour has come for the manifestation of God to be made known Among Us what is the manifestation of God it's the bride's Revival among the bride's Revival is not a bunch of emotion the bride's Revival is not a bunch of hard encounter amen the bride's Revival is a manifestation of God and only those who recognize amen the manifestation of God are those who goes in the Rapture the prophet said we see the next thing amen we're waiting can I preach to you tonight we're waiting for the called out the elected seat of Abraham who is recognized the manifestation of God among his people and they are standing and they are waiting they are the ones who will be called up Amen to meet the Lord in the air another place the last time they got was the manifestation of God in flesh amen could read the heart of a woman behind him in the tent and the next thing was their bodies was changed among young people if you could get your eyes open by the message of the earth you would you would living from camp meeting to camp meeting you and quit living from special service to special service you would start living every day amen with your eyes on the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm going to preach to you now you got to get your eyes off everything that's going on around you you got to get your ass off but he said she said they said they're doing and get your eyes back on this message it's a focus it's a purpose it's a vision it's a direction I'm on church amen this message will lead you out of time into the eternities of God listen I can say this with a clear Assurance you are on the verge of your bodies being changed come on Church you are on the verge of your bodies being changed look now amen we got to get back to the truth the word he said now you want to know where the sacred lies Amen in the power of the visions and things is back to the word it's the word of God Jesus was the word he was the manifestation of God Amen and God was in Christ amen reconciling the world to himself and he was the word he said see in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh watch a prophet turn and say and the word wants to be made our flesh now brother Joel that's not little simple teachings the word wants to be made our flesh but when we're all wrapped up in all kinds of stuff and traditions and permitted to live like the world and things like that then expect God to do that amen certainly he won't I don't care how many things we impersonate he said he'll only come to his word listen the word is wanting your flesh come on young people that's the bride's Revival is the word In the Flesh of the Bride come on can I say this plain as I know how you are the manifestation of God in the age you're living in he said Jesus Christ was the person amen man God hallelujah he was the manifestation of God he was God in a body form to reflect the word of God for that age to make fat AIDS see God's promise for that age amen the word come into Jesus amen to reflect itself out of Jesus and that was the Revival it was Jesus was the Revival among young people amen and that same God Has Come Into Your Heart by by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he is using your flesh he is using your hands he is using your feet Amen to reflect the promises of this hey I'm on Church he's not bringing Paul back to do it he's not bringing William Branham back to do it but he's going to take young boys he's going to take my own size he's going to take your hands he's going to take your voice Amen to stand up in a Sunday morning service and testify and for God of the Bible come into my life find experience in the Holy Ghost he's going to take your hands Levi he's going to take your mouth charge he's going to take you I will go and say it if you're looking for the bride's Revival look no further she's here the bride's Revival is here the bride's Revival is the word being manifested in the flesh of humanity it's the manifestation of God and the Holy Ghost is the thing same thing today it's the spirit of God upon the written word trying to find somebody to reflect itself to this age to prove he's the same yesterday today and forever may I go ahead and say this this bride is not asleep this ride is not still waiting to be awakened but the prophet of God set the wake of the Bride will be those Thunder those seven Thunders now Revelation 10 3 cry with a loud voice that's when a lion roars and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had other voices I was about to write amen and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seventh unders uttered and wrath him not now if you really wonder I'm gonna make it real quick here if you really want to break into this amen the Thunder is the voice of God contrary to what anybody else says amen the prophet of God you got the table on your phone you can go read it the voice of God is the thunder John 12 first seal glorify thy name the voice of God is the thunder he said then it was in the untimed period of Jesus that those seven Thunders come forth what was in those Thunders no one knows but we need to know come on young people we didn't know it back then but we need to know it well but then there were young people we don't need them but a prophet didn't say the old people need to know and the young people need to catch up he said we need an orange so there's no age limit on the revelation of this word that is coming in the age we're living in amen old people can know it but 12 year old boys can know it older sisters can know it but 10 year old girls cannot it's the prevailing power to overcome laodicea it's the prevailing power come on you want to overcome the devil get under the revelation of the word of God and the age of living and that devil will have to chase you down that devil chases you around and chases you around amen won't you chase him down sometime once you get under the message and Chase that devil down that devil chases you a depression chases you a fish chase you that amen I tell you what's not going to deliver you it's a feeling I tell you what's not going to leave you as a sensation but I will tell you what deliver you is a quickening power coming up on the word of God and the age you're living in and you'll let that devil sparing the face and say the God in Me is no match for you big boy come on these aren't just clothes these are living realities I heard a prophet say Aaliyah I heard a prophet say that you can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with you I heard a prophets hey you can live in the presence of God 24 7 365. it does not come on you can put us in the water put us in the whales barely we'll still be the Revival put us on the mountain put us in the valley but it's in school put us in work put us in college wherever you put this bride she's on fire because the word the word the unchanging God with unchanging ways hell God young people you want something to shout about shout about this message you want something to dance about dance about the seventh angel you want something to scream your lungs out scream that God has fulfilled his word and has restored us to the divine order we're not looking for the message we are the message we're not looking for the revelation we are the revelation and there's no such prevailing Force as the force of Revelation now the part of God said like this he said when theologians and people have departed from the word God always somebody say always God always sent his word back to the people but by a prophet all right then the messenger Malachi for you all know that right Malachi 4 behold I sin unto you a lie to the prophet Revelation 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seven things when he shall begin to sound see he's going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he's going to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers the second thing he's going to do is going to reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals now it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that will literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers there is no age limit on the revelation of this message there is no age limit on the revelation of the atmosphere of the supernatural Gods you can dwell in because it's not a emotional Revival it's not a musical Revival it is a word revival can we agree that bride's Revival is a word's Revival listen if you showed up here tonight and your Revival is music what are you going to do if the power goes out and they can't play the music if you showed up in your Revival was in your favorite preacher and you got here and he wasn't here what are you going to do go sit in your dorm and eat Doritos for the rest of the weekend amen you're Revival is not in the music your Revival is not in just a preacher your Revival is in the word then wherever the word is we can have a Revival if there's one there or 200 there we can have a Revival among our revivalists not coming from the music our Revival is not coming from Sensation our Revival is coming from the word that has been restored through the voice of the seventh angel It's Shouting Time It's Hallelujah time the word is back in the church the Invincible Army is not coming she is here the bride's Revival is a word Revival education can never bring life it takes the spirit of God to bring life and that life must not come just out of the intellect's Revival it's got to come out of the Bible the word Revival and that word is the same brother that word is the same yesterday today and forever and when it falls today and it quickens you get the same results that you did in Acts the second chapter it always has always will be because it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere the spirit of God conditions the atmosphere and then he says see it takes atmosphere to do things the spirit of God conditions the atmosphere because it takes an atmosphere to do things now when you look at this word condition Webster says it means to bring something into the desired state for use now you all know amen the product of God said that Samson knew in his present masculine condition he could not produce the strength of the challenge of the hour he said men and women brothers and sisters let me say this the church in its present denominational condition cannot produce the strength Amen to challenge the time he said to call at a time but thank God he would send the seventh angel who would have the voice of Revelation and he would call the bride out of the church he never said the bride was not in condition he said the church was not in condition and the seventh angel called The Bride out of the church amen to put her into condition by the restoration of the word to meet the child challenge every hour listen I said like this there's a reason why the Prophet come in this age and preached a sermon called Church order he said because the atmosphere must be in a condition Amen to be to receive and to produce what God is sending now the promise said is this okay he said now I said like this he said I believe that worshipers coming in they should be met he said see with hospitality notice this he said oh my in the love to see the church Living God go on he said now these worshipers should not talk one with another and be talking across making noise in the church brother Andrew why are you preaching this because we need an atmosphere amen I say thank God for a prophet who could even put the atmosphere in order that God could come down and feel welcome in now y'all know I'm preaching to you tonight amen thank God for a prophet that even got the atmosphere back y'all imagine coming in here tonight amen and they start the service and bends back her heart brother Jason and Colby's heart up here amenities house amen and Josh is hard over here well how did your trip go how oh where'd y'all stop and eat amen what kind of atmosphere would that be in amen but you come in here and there's music playing amen then there's a song leader who begins to sing what are they doing they are conditioning the atmosphere amen they're preparing an atmosphere to welcome the word into because the prophet said the most important part of the service is the word amen then when you receive a word if it's going to be a manifested word it's going to be received in an atmosphere that it can manifest itself in now when you want to see this amen the proud of God said when the word falls into the ground and it's quickened he said it will produce the same results in the church today that it did in Acts the second chapter now come on Amen all the way back thousands of years ago the word fell into the upper room and It produced in the atmosphere because it was an atmosphere that was prepared to produce the word him said like this he said you'll get the same results amen that they got an acts of the second chapter and I find it very amazing that when you start studying these things you will find that there's actually three ingredients if I could say it that way I'm not a cook but there's three ingredients they meant to see results amen the first one is our approach the second one is our attitude and the third is our atmosphere somebody say with me our approach our attitude and the atmosphere now the problem God said you must come by the right approach Psalm 65 verse 4 David said blessed is the man whom thou chooses and calls us to approach to thee that he may dwell in the courts that we shall be satisfied with the goodness of the house even of the Holy Temple remember says it like this he said God has a way of Repro of approach he said now if you're going to visit a king there's a way to approach a king the boy who wants to approach a young lady Amen to get acquainted with her there's a certain approach you can't just come up there and say hey there I'd like to meet with you and shake your hand he said she she isn't very much of a lady amen she'll let you know where to get on and off at that's right there's a certain way you want to approach it you want to come with respects to that lady and so forth so right there the prophet connects respects with your approach it was not a coincidence he preaches an entire tape called respects and says if you're going to approach God you've got to come through the channel of respects listen if you want to receive something from the spirit of God you've got to respect the spirit of God if you want to receive something from these meetings you've got to respect these meetings I'm not talking about the walls I'm not talking about the concrete I'm talking about the person who is coming to visit you in these meetings his name is the Lord Jesus Christ and if you want an audience with him you've got to respect him you got to worship him you got to adore him come on well brother Andrew I don't feel like worshiping it ain't based on how you feel rather than I don't feel like getting in it ain't based the way you feel amen there's a word here and it's an anointed word and if you will surrender yourself to the anointed word that word will come in a cold atmosphere it'll come in a it'll come in a divisive atmosphere wherever you welcome the word the word will work wherever you welcome the word the word will work if you put in the fiery furnace it'll work there if you put it in the Lion's Den it'll work Fair wherever you respect the word and receive the word you'll see a manifestation of that word there's always approach to all things he said then there's a way to approach God and if we don't know the approach to God we'll never be able to get an audience with God that's who we're here to see is God that's who we're here to have a com have a conference with is God and if we don't find the approach we'll never be able to talk to him if we don't find the approach or the same will never get an audience with him amen but if there's an approach then there's a people to find that approach and there's a God to talk to he said you come God provided approach one time and see what happens now this word approaches a very powerful definition to me because it means to draw closer to it makes it means to make advances to especially in order create a desired result if you're approaching something you've got a desired result already in mind you're expecting to get out of what you're approaching come on if you if you're approaching a judge and then you're expecting to get a you're expecting to get a good verdict you're expecting to get a good word so you've already got a desire amen so you're approaching him in a way that is conducive to get the desire and the results you're desire I'm on church I'm gonna come on young boys go talk to that young lady amen you go talk to her you've got one thing in mind you want to get to know her you want to shake her hand you want to meet her you want to what church do you go to you don't just walk up and say well like the prophet said amen how you do like to talk to you he said see that's not an approach now come on friends how are we approaching these meetings are we just approaching as another Youth Camp are we just approaching as well as 2023 it's Mars it's time we all go down to Oklahoma I say if that's the way you've come you'll leave that way but if you come here with Your Mind Set On Jesus with your heart focused with a spirit of person appearance upon your heart amen you will pressure come on I'll tell you this if you're going to get an audience with God it's not going to be easy if you're going to get an audience with God you're gonna have to fight two Devils you're gonna have to fight through Spirits you're gonna have to fight through unbelief amen but if you can fight for it come on church right now the devil does not want this meeting Amen to go to the next level this devil does not want you to receive your Miracle he wants us to be just another Youth Camp and just another song and another sermon and another get together but I propose to you that this is a life-changing weekend I propose to you that this is a weekend with a god of gods we're the King of Kings where the Lord of lords can come into a building he can change Hearts he can change lives come on bet you got to know how to approach it anybody want to leave here with a miracle you gotta know how to approach the god that gives Miracles anybody want to leave here with an answer you got to know how to approach The God Who can give you the answer if you find the right approach if you can find the right approach you will find amen the desire and the result you say brother I'm a sinner I'm not worthy to talk to God well that devil that told you that is a liar because a prophet said that God has provided an approach through the shed blood of the Lamb been with fat blood amen there's some cold air coming up here if you can turn it off would be great with fat blood you can approach god with that blood you can actually come to him and he will not be seeing you he will be seeing the blood in other words the prophet said the way to approach God to his people is through the shed blood it has been from that day till this day the same thing the shedding of blood brings the approach to God Hebrews 9 22 says almost all things are purged by the law with purged with blood and without the shedding of blood is no remission then without the blood we can't have a youth camp come on Church without the blood I cannot tell you that you can leave here change without the blood I cannot tell you amen that a miracle can take place but because there is a blood there is a position there is a proper possibility oh God there is an approach see River said see he's behind the blood now speaking of God he said I'm behind the blood now I'm the strength Giver I'm the satisfier I'm the all-sufficient one I am your approach who is our approach he says the Lord Jesus see then God provide an approach and through that approach the blood we can come to a new birth what if Christ had found so much fault in you that he wouldn't have died for you but see he was God's approach see our approach to God is through him see if you approach something finding fault with it how do you expect to get a good result from it come on church if you approach something find and fault in it how you go well well well well we might as well pretend we were here amen if you come in here already critical how do you expect to get a blessing well it's just going to be the same old way and they're going to sing the same old song and they're going to do this amen that's not the approach that's a critical approach and if you come a critical approach relief with a critical result amen but if you come God's provided approach if you come to the approach if there's no one good except Jesus Christ there's no one deserving but him there's no one that is entitled but him then you leave a different way because you come the right approach there is an approach to all things I love this and I found this today brother Colby I thought it's powerful there is an approach to war and I believe that this is I think it's what hand-to-hand combat amen it's wartime amen it's time to fight back against the devil it's time to drive back against that evil one and the father of God said do you know there's an approach to war in the army of God it is first by music well there goes every critical devil about music just got all watered up right there amen the approach to war is first by God through music he said the singers went before the ark and they're rejoicing in the singing then come the ark which was the word and then the battle see that's the reason we come in service at night what do we do we sing the hymns of the Lord he said and then the ark the word read the word and then the battle that we're in but the great Banners are flying tonight the name of Jesus Christ the Lord God is exalted and may the enemy be put to fight and God win the victory tonight and save souls and heal the sick and Afflicted calls those who are weary and stoop low to raise up their hands and rejoice and get great Glory unto himself the prophet of God is showing you the approach to God is to the blood the approach to it changes through the New Birth the approach to war is through worship and the word you say well I don't think so I don't think the approach is very important all right we'll go talk to a judge and walk in there with your blue jeans on and your hoodie on come on walk in there with with looking like he just got out of bed come on your sweatpants amen amen that judge ain't gonna see you he's going to tell you to get out of there because there's a way to approach now if we get the right approach then the next thing is we got to come with the right attitude amen come in the right approach amen and come with the right attitude come by the right approach with the right attitude you say but then I don't think my attitude matters when I tell you your attitude stinks if that's the way you feel your attitude already stinks well brother Andrew I understand amen no we need a change of attitude come on you counselors aren't you Mom and Daddy and I know some of y'all come on and I know some of your mom and daddies and I know they won't take sassin so don't give you counselors no assassin well I don't know how I got there but I'm here anyhow well Belinda I just tell you right now ain't nobody gonna tell me what to do amen Once you turn that sass from your mom and daddy to the devil won't you sass that devil one time let the Holy Ghost change your attitude and sash that devil talk to that devil like he ought to be talked to tell him he's no good he ain't got no control over you he ain't gonna get one second of this meeting come on Church he's defeated he's a liar he's a bluff he lost the ballot Calvary Jesus Christ is your father and the word is your mother amen talk to that devil like he ought to be talked to put that devil in his place and change your attitude you ought to change attitude it'll do good for you one time [Applause] well I might as well preach it's Thursday night and I feel good change your attitude you say but then I'm ready for Revival and you got a bad attitude you need to change it rather than I'm ready for a miracle and you've got an old negative attitude it's time to change it let the Holy Ghost come in the room tonight and change her attitude you know what your attitude determines your attitude determines your altitude however oh God however positive your attitude is is however High your altitude can be and if you've got an old brother Jewels he says wow see wowzy woo poor pitiful me attitude you might as well stay home amen well brother Andrew if it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no luck at all hey man let's change her attitude let's take an attitude based off of the word that is a positive attitude come on church if you come the right approach amen the blood will change your attitude if you come the right approach amen the new birth will change your attitude if you come the right approach it won't be a church attitude it won't be a church atmosphere it'll be a word attitude it'll be a word approach you gotta come with a right you got to come by the right approach you got to come with the right attitude listen this the Bible says in Matthew 25 15 25 then came she speaking of the seraphenician woman and she worshiped him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it is not meat to take the children's bread and they cast it to dogs and she said well ain't nobody going to talk to me like that because I'll have you know whose church I go to and I'll have you know what family I come out of and I'll have you know who I am no she had the right attitude you know why because she come the right approach she said Lord that's the truth but even the dogs leap the crumbs which fall from their master's table she knew if she was going to get an audience with God she had to have an attitude change she had to have an approach she had to have a change and the prophet God said see you put me on record tonight in these recorders I have no apology for this remark I'm fixing to make I believe and can prove that right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass see the right mental attitude he said but you got to have the right attitude the attitude is what brings the results well I thought it was the approach amen the approach is an advance Amen to create the result that you're Desiring amen but the next thing is the right attitude dude amen save the right attitude if you say yes yes I believe it but I don't know now that's not the right attitude the right attitude you want to put this down y'all too the right attitude is to receive it and say it's thus saith the Lord and then it's right then what is an attitude an attitude is a settled way of thinking or feeling about someone or something it is typically it is typically one that is reflected in a person's Behavior so an attitude does not change amen but it's settled come on now an attitude does not change with the conditions of things but an attitude finds a finds a stability and anchors itself there listen the part of God goes on to say before you come in this prayer line he said all right you're the patient aren't you yes sister before I take a hold of your hand I want to talk to you just a little bit of course you're just a little nervous kind of saying now here here's where the operating in the first pool which was what the sign in the hand which was contacting the disease and before he can operate in the first pool he said I want to get you in the right attitude of God mentally speaking amen towards God's promise before I pray for you Abraham said like this watch them on a platform sometime in a healing service and watch the attitude they come in here the other night I remember the lady come up here with just about well I didn't have enough Faith hardly get to the platform she had been in the prayer line after prayer line and I know the woman wasn't going to get well I seen her coming up there I knew it wasn't she didn't have the right attitude when she come up to get well oh come on church she was in the presence of a prophet of God she was under the anointing of the Holy Spirit but her attitude was wrong and he said she couldn't get healed because she had the wrong attitude she can't do it I said the Lord bless you Sister may go on and may God heal you it's all I could say it's just not there why she had been here and there and everywhere you can't do that you got to take God in his word because if you come in the right attitude no one ever come to Christ in the right attitude but what went away was what they asked for no one ever come to Christ with the right attitude but what they went away with what they come to ask God for he said now that can be done if our attitude towards him if we come to see him and to love him and to worship him then God is obligated to give us some things we desire and he will withhold no good thing from them that walk right up towards him see notice this it's the power of the right attitude amen you got to come by the right approach amen I know it's the first night I'm laying some word in here you got to come by the right approach you've got to come by the right attitude remember said look at this God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life he said that's a little piece of scripture just a teeny little one inch square on just a piece of paper yet if the right attitude is taken to that scripture it would change the Eternal destination of this world foreign Church the right attitude towards one scripture could change the entire Eternal destination of the world come on then what about you it's not just feeding off a one word of John 3 16 but the lamb has descended with an open book and a seventh angel who was a prophet of God has received the word of God and has preached the Revelation my own church we ought to change our attitude towards Malachi Thor we ought to change our attitude towards Luke 17 30. we ought to change our attitude towards Revelation come on we ought to say oh God this weekend change my attitude towards every scripture in the word [Applause] oh brother Andrew I'll tell you what amen I'll tell you what I'm here for this weekend praise God I'm here for that third pull brother I'm here for that spoken word brother I'm here to move mountains well let me just tell you what a prophet said he said God give me power to move mountains I tell you I'll do something for you Lord if you let me move mountains no he wouldn't because he can't even move himself to the right attitude so he would never move mountains for God with the wrong attitude you can't even move mountains for God come on he said he can't even move himself uh Josh you got that amen tape back there with the wrong attitude he can't even move himself into position to even receive from God come on friends I think we've been letting some things go I think we ought to get an attitude change your attitude Robert Andrew it's just brother Wendell that's your pastor change your attitude remember then it's just brother Andrew that's your pastor change right whatever it's just our brother so and so change your attitude maybe you can clean it up in the morning change your attitude whatever Lander I don't know well come by the right approach with the right attitude in the right atmosphere rubham said like this he said look when Jesus went in jairus's house he said he went in there and they laughed in the scorn but when he had put them all out now Jesus here shows you that atmospheres are not made atmospheres are created atmospheres are not made they are created because the people in there that could help me make an atmosphere he had to put them out because the way they were approaching him and the attitude they had about him he said I can't perform in here I can't operate so we put the game Sayers and the and the unbelievers out and he created his own atmosphere and the father God said watch each one of you is a Creator do you know that each one of your people that's born again is a Creator then we must create an atmosphere you just keep believing and create the atmosphere and never let any doubt come around you no matter what the circumstances is you push away down and you walk right on through it you just refuse it do not give doubt no grounds at all then what is the atmosphere it is a surrounding influence or an environment then the problem God shows us that a spiritual atmosphere is an atmosphere of worship and believing he said see oh my amen you're going to go to a dance one man step say well now he don't know whether he wants to dance or not and let's go over here playing the music near my God to thee huh what an atmosphere for a dance he said well that's not a lot different than atmosphere should go into a church for a service to God just that contrary see the only thing to bring the right atmosphere is then for the dance to put on your own music that makes dances now watch this and everybody get to thinking what a good time they're going to have a dancing where did oh God where did the atmosphere start for the dance it started in their thoughts now I'm not preaching psychology I'm preaching with a prophet saying it started in their thoughts they started thinking what a good dance we're going to have what a loopy time we're going to have wanna what a rock and roll time we're gonna hat right they started thinking that and so forth and they'll be having a big whooping up time but you put the right kind of music on the piano and the right kind of music on the organ and everybody in the atmosphere that Jesus Christ is there and he's going to meet everything they have need of Amen something will go to taken place amen notice this atmosphere the hardest thing there is to do is to get the people in the atmosphere of worship he said the atmosphere believe him but I propose to you what a prophet said If the message of the hour comes into a supernatural atmosphere it will produce a bride's Revival he said like this that's a paraphrase we need to produce the word again put it on a cross on a nail I'm on church if you want to produce this word today don't carry it up to Golgotha and put it on a cross brother Kevin it will produce itself there because there's not an atmosphere to produce the word he said but put it in the heart of a Believer on the right atmosphere it'll produce exactly what it says it will do it's going to be in the right atmosphere you lay it in a seminary or a bible school that don't believe in signs and wonders you'll never see it Break Forth but you gotta put it in the right atmosphere can we ask brother random what kind of atmosphere what kind of atmosphere brother Brandon a surrendered atmosphere you put this word in a surrendered atmosphere it will produce he said if it stays there it'll go to taken life if you take any promise of God and place it in the right atmosphere it will produce exactly what the life is in the seed wherever you put this message I'm not going to preach all night I'm close in a minute wherever you put this message it will produce the life that's in it I don't know well I know you're the carrier of the seed you are carrying the word seed on the inside of you now brother Andrew why would you say that well because acts the second chapter there was a hundred and twenty Believers you know what they were carrying they were carrying the seed of the promise of the father from Luke the 24th chapter in their wombs but the problem with God said there had to be an atmosphere created for the promised word of the father to be fulfilled in listen this it's the attitude of the people that brings the results that's the reason that Pentecost they had to go into an upper room and pray until the Holy Ghost came because they got in one place one Accord see it's the atmosphere that brings the results do you believe that do you believe that can you take a prophetic challenge right now can you take one from a prophet he said let every man and woman in this building this morning boy or girl get everything from their minds but the Lord Jesus and believe that he stand in prison right now and you'll see something happen that'll cause headlines in the newspaper in the morning see it's the atmosphere it's the atmosphere that brings the miraculous and wonders and powers of God Among the people it's the atmosphere of the people and when people get to a place to reason and wondering and stood and take an altar up they don't know where they stand he said see get in one Accord in one place and settle down with one motive and one objective then you're going to see something happen come on church we didn't just come here to hear about something happening we come here to see something happen brother sister I propose to you that Bible days are here again I propose to you that's a god of history is the god of right now I propose to you if you'll get your mind on the Revelation that Jesus Christ the son of God is raised from the dead and he's here in the rooms of his resurrection I propose to you blinded eyes can come open I propose to you that deaf ears can be unstopped I propose to you if a dead can be raised I propose to you that Sinners can be turned into Believers I propose to you that prodigals can come home apropos to you that all things are possible I'm not a crazy man I've been under the blood I've been through the approach it changed my attitude it changed the way I preach it changed the way I sing you want to change get under the blood come on I'd pay you somewhere you can't go with an old bad attitude and keep it's under the blood oh you know what I'm talking about don't you buddy hey amen I see are you hearing me are you hearing me get under blood one time it'll change your outlook well so and so can't get saved it's cause you ain't been under the blood ha remember it's too bad for sister so and so get under the blood what are you saying I'm saying if he done it before if he done it before he can do it again I got brother Nathan back her waving his hand as a witness if he done it before he'll do it again I see Miguel there amen come on I see Thomas right here come on young people we ain't got to take a back seat in the bride's Revival we got a front seat on the front row representative I'd have been there in the 50s and the 60s I would have been right turn to Brown's Revival man if I'd have been there back when brother Brandon was here but what about it young people you got a front row seat to the greatest Revival Hallelujah you got a front row seat to the greatest Revival that has ever hit the place tell me since when since the days of creation has a man stood in flesh and discerned the thoughts and intentional heart it hasn't been done but in the day you're living in the son of man has returned to the church come on Church this message didn't dismissed the blood it revealed the blood this message didn't dismiss the cross it revealed the cross it revealed it as the provided approach I'm not a crazy man you come too late I'm under the blood and the only thing I can see is what the blood sees the only thing I can say is what the blood speaks the only thing I can hear is what the blood is sounding forth and the blood is sounding forgiven Justified wellander it's too late it ain't too late come on Church it ain't too late Robert Andrew we got here a little bit too late we didn't get here too late [Applause] I say this if God tarries has come another 20 years you'll still have a front row seat to the bride's Revival [Applause] well that's coming to me so I might as well preach it you know why some of y'all ain't enjoying the bride's Revival is you're sitting in the wrong seat you need to change your seat come on Church there's two seats you can send it y'all ever been to a play ever been to a drama versus stage and there's all kinds of seats amen there's all kinds of seats but there's one stage there's one place where the actors are performing there's one stage so if you get a balcony seat brother Ben you get a balcony view if you'll get a front row seed you'll get a front row view beseech you're sitting in will depend on the results or the view you get well I just tell you this there's two seats to this ride's revival you can find the first one in the Book of Psalms it's called The Seed of the scornful so you go sit and see the scoring full and everybody that shouts everybody that dances everybody that Praises god well they ain't got no right to do that and they ain't got no right to say that amen and then you get in the other seat it's found the book of Ephesians you know what it's called seated in Heavenly places if you will change your seat from the seat of the scornful to the seat of heavenly places it'll change the way you see this weekend come on church if you're in the seat of the scornful it's another Youth Camp I'm another preacher it'll be another prayer line it'll be another shout in Hallelujah service but if your change seats to the seat of heavenly places it'll be the resurrection it'll be the supernatural it'll be the Shekinah Glory it'll be the answer to the devil's question it'll be the releasing of the Revelation it'll be the porn out of the earth to anoint David to be king change your seat change your seat get out of that old seat of the scornful feels pretty good to sit up front down in Austin feels pretty good to sin in Heavenly places I'm gonna borrow my buddy brother Ron saying right now if all these people are getting on your nerves stand up stand up with them foreign you need to change your seat come on Church you're not late you got a front row seat remember what are you getting at I'm saying if you can get your heart focused through the right approach with the right attitude in the right atmosphere you will see the result yeah but Andrew what are you getting at I'm closing right here give me five minutes remember said let their faith just meet the condition and it will be for thou is said in the heart if I believe so shall it be make the whole atmosphere here Lord a creative atmosphere I took time today Brother Joseph I took time today to read to the prophet of God's teachings on atmosphere he called it a Heavenly atmosphere he called it a perfect atmosphere he called it a living atmosphere he called it a surrendered atmosphere he called it a spiritual atmosphere he called it a supernatural atmosphere he called it a creative atmosphere what is a creative atmosphere one mind and one Accord in one place okay so brother Andrew this is my Approach my attitude an atmosphere do those really determine the results I'll see well can we ask a lady named Martha Martha was sitting there while Mary was doing her normal daily routine her activities and the prophet of God said why Martha was sitting there here come Jesus and she went out to meet Jesus in other words brother Manuel she didn't say Jesus you come to me I mean Lord I made it all the way out here to Pawnee Oklahoma now if you're going to meet me come on down here Lord but she got up and went out to meet Jesus brother Ben said because she had read the story of the shunamat woman oh God he said now notice this he said he didn't have no absolute speaking of Elijah he knowed he had power by the vision to give her a child but now what did he do the cinema woman remember he said he took his staff and went down in the room and shut all the doors and taken everybody else out come on that's the same thing Jesus did when he raised jairus's daughter he put all the unbelievers out and said the atmosphere is not conducive to a resurrection the atmosphere is not in condition to receive life so all these gangstayers have got to go and let those who believe stay here and Elijah stood there and he went over there walked up and down the room he said he had an absent if he could only contact it he said now what did he do he went around went over there and laid himself on the baby got back up went away and the baby moved got warm went back over he said what was it Lord what do you say he said now notice this when he turned he saw this and he saw the little boy running playing jumping with a rope something other like that and he throwed himself upon the baby and he stuck his nose opponent's lips his lips upon its lips and the power of God raised up the baby life he said what was it the woman's absolute was the prophet and the prophet's absolute was God and together with the word he said I am the resurrection and the life I see the power of God the Creator can do it see she raised up again the baby remember said see watch that tells whether you're going to the right absolute or not if you can read it in the scripture amen Martha's absolute was coming from what she read in the scripture let's just shoot them out woman he said something that Christ has ordained or commissioned us to do he said don't let somebody twist it around you stay right with it he's your absolute young people let me say with everything within me this message is not an opinion it's an absolute thank you and if you can tie your faith to it if you can tie your desires to John if you can tie your life to it it'll pull you through every situation it'll pull you through every dark hour it'll pull you through every depression it'll pull you through every anxiety it'll pull you through ever nervous this message is an absolute Anchor Church thank you I leave your fish if Martha could read in the Bible and see that the shunamite woman got the desire of her heart because she recognized that God that the age lived in his prophet the god of that age lived in his Prophet how much more was he in his son there he was God was in his son reconciling the world to himself she knew that so she ran up to him with the right attitude and she said Lord if I would have spent here my brother would not have died let me know that was I could call you the right name that was the right attitude if you had been here Lord my brother would not have died but Lord he's dead now and I know what you did for the shunamat woman I know how you move back there all hopes are over that's not the approach that's not the attitude she said but even now Lord [Applause] thank you even now Lord whatever I ask I know you're going to do young people I'm close with this even now even now I know it may begin late I know it may be just the first night but you've come the right approach you've got the right attitude you've created the right atmosphere I say speak even now Lord my brother who's been dead four days Well church things can't change Faith things can change I know why things can change because the changer is in the building I said the changer is in the building The God Who Walks on Waters in the building The God Who raises the dead is in the building the God who stepped out on nothing and created everything he's in this building I say oh God have your way have your way Among Us Lord receive our worship receive our praise we welcome you to
