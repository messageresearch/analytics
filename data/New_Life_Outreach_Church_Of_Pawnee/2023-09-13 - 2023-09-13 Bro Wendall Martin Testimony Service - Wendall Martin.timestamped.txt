[10:04] of that
[10:04] but you know at the end during the
[10:07] service and at the end of the service
[10:09] amen each one there was a a real a real
[10:13] just real specialness a real where you
[10:17] amen I uh from the very first night uh
[10:21] just weeping before the Lord
[10:23] and I felt like there was a lot of
[10:24] wonderful victories that were taking
[10:26] place
[10:27] brother Branham talked about the victory
[10:29] days
[10:30] he said you know
[10:32] he said we call the victory the v-day he
[10:36] said there's where I draw my text from
[10:38] that v-day Victory Day
[10:40] that was the day that they took the
[10:42] victory now where the armies took the
[10:45] victory over the other armies that's the
[10:46] v-day
[10:47] there there is a D-Day and then there
[10:50] was a Victory Day the D-Day is when they
[10:53] went into fight the v-day is when the
[10:56] peace was signed when Germany and the
[10:58] rest of them rallied uh or their Allied
[11:01] Nations and all surrendered to the other
[11:03] nations what did we do
[11:06] at the v-day we sang songs we screamed
[11:10] we throwed our hats in the air we shot
[11:13] the guns in the air we cried we blowed
[11:16] whistles we beat drums we played music
[11:19] we beat one another on the back what was
[11:22] it it was a victory oh we had the
[11:25] Victory and we felt why we felt we have
[11:28] won we have won the flags went up the
[11:31] trumpets sounded and what a time we had
[11:34] victory victory victory we won and it
[11:37] was a great thing it brought peace to
[11:40] the Christian nations that so-called and
[11:44] we had little time of of breathing we or
[11:47] we had a little time of breathing some
[11:49] of the boys that was living come back
[11:52] home and so forth and and them days have
[11:55] been many of them many great Wars but
[11:58] you know as long as there has been that
[12:00] kind of a battle fought there has also
[12:02] been God's believing people has had many
[12:05] great V days too
[12:08] oh yes there's been on both sides where
[12:11] the glass is focused on and went to the
[12:14] Natural side with v days but also where
[12:17] it focuses into the word in the
[12:19] scripture and it brings another v-day
[12:21] sometimes and we've had many of them
[12:24] great battles against our enemy and God
[12:27] has had great men out there standing at
[12:29] the front who've been able to capture by
[12:32] the spirit of God the thoughts of the
[12:34] people and throw it into the kingdom of
[12:36] God down there and come out Victorious
[12:38] we fight we fight it every day every
[12:41] Christian fights a great battle every
[12:44] day and we're in a Warfare right now
[12:47] constantly going on constantly within us
[12:50] between right and wrong shall we receive
[12:52] it what shall we do what shall we bound
[12:54] to the world shall we give up this that
[12:56] we got
[12:57] if we could just see it and focus it and
[13:00] take it from Genesis to Revelations
[13:02] she's thus saith the Lord each time
[13:04] write down through there you can't give
[13:07] it up we can't compromise with the rest
[13:09] of them we just can't do it we've got to
[13:12] stay here that's all no matter how great
[13:15] the enemy is and how much the Machinery
[13:17] he's got against us how many
[13:19] organizations how many this that or the
[13:21] other we have pulled this focus of God's
[13:24] word until we find that there's one
[13:26] thing and that's the blood of Jesus
[13:28] Christ and he's the same yesterday today
[13:31] and forever therefore it don't make any
[13:35] difference what anyone else says they
[13:38] say the days of Miracles has passed
[13:39] there's no such thing as Divine Healing
[13:41] there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:43] baptism in Jesus name that was for the
[13:45] disciples only all these things they try
[13:47] to focus off of it but still focuses
[13:50] right back to the word and nobody can
[13:53] can say it's not there that's right
[13:55] God's hero has always had a Warfare and
[14:01] a v-day amen
[14:05] and so I believe that there is there's
[14:08] going to be many more there's going to
[14:10] be many more uh d-days there's going to
[14:12] be many more times we're going to have
[14:14] to go out and fight the enemy amen but I
[14:18] just think we need to rejoice when we do
[14:20] have our v-days need to rejoice when God
[14:23] does help us to overcome and the power
[14:26] of the Holy Spirit does come down upon
[14:29] us amen and see us through the way that
[14:32] he's wanting us to be and so amen so

[14:38] and and testimonies and specials and and
[14:41] I'd like to hear specials and
[14:44] testimonies and we just amen enjoy the
[14:47] presence of the Lord the Ark of the
[14:49] Covenant always went before the people

[31:33] I am a hard head but I'm a hard head for
[31:36] the Lord now and that's what I want for
[31:38] My People Back Home the natives
[31:40] throughout throughout the United States

[32:01] asking special prayers for him because
[32:03] man he is the biggest hard head there is
[32:05] but he's he's learning he's learning
[32:09] he's open and I've never seen it he came
[32:12] from an atheist to now he's he says he
[32:14] believes and he says he's got the Lord
[32:16] living in his heart so
[32:18] tomorrow is his surgery and I just have
[32:22] a good feeling in my heart whether he
[32:24] takes him up there and heals him or
[32:26] leaves him here and let him be a walking
[32:28] testimony
[32:29] I praise God and his sister she hears
[32:33] the prayers she sees the things that are
[32:35] going on and she's another one that's
[32:37] coming in I claim her
[32:39] for Jesus I do
[32:41] and Sister Christine was telling me
[32:44] that that she received a lot of
[32:48] the same thing as as I said the baggage
[32:51] that we carried in from the world
[32:54] it's gone and that's why the devil
[32:57] fought her so hard the other day because
[32:58] because she had that testimony on her
[33:01] heart
[33:03] so I just thank God and I just been

[44:47] myself out of it
[44:49] I really enjoyed the meetings
[44:51] and the Lord held me before the meeting
[44:53] so this meeting's uh the only complaint
[44:56] is they went by too fast it's like a
[44:58] Flash and it was over with but during
[45:00] the song series you could just feel the
[45:01] pulsating yeah the expectations is
[45:04] really good and I was blessed
[45:07] [Music]
[45:09] [Applause]
[45:17] sister Angie McDougall
[45:20] has a testimony and a song right
[45:24] amen no song Sorry
[45:28] you don't want to hear me sing
[45:31] um okay so a few months ago I was
[45:34] awakened like at 3am
[45:36] there was a very stealing calm in my
[45:38] room and there was no doubt present
[45:41] something spoke to me and said start
[45:44] speaking to your mountains so I did
[45:47] and then inside my head I went around
[45:49] the church and pictured all of the
[45:51] people
[45:52] in your seats you know started speaking
[45:54] things for each of you
[45:56] that I knew were in need
[45:58] and after I was done something spoke
[46:00] again and said there are miracles for
[46:02] many
[46:05] I placed that in my heart and I'm
[46:07] expecting
[46:09] so on Wednesday night whether Daryl
[46:11] spoke of giving it your all and
[46:15] the person who could only give 83 cents
[46:18] but it was still they're all
[46:19] well I ironically only had anyone since
[46:22] so I humbly put it in the basket
[46:26] the next day
[46:28] I couldn't stay in my filthy car any
[46:30] longer so I told the Lord I'd really
[46:32] like to wash it and I don't like to use
[46:35] the hose because it leaves water spots I
[46:37] wanted to go to the car wash but I
[46:39] didn't have the money to do it
[46:44] um
[46:45] he spoke to me and said
[46:47] go to the car wash anyway so I did
[46:50] when I got there the pressure washer was
[46:53] on that never happens
[46:56] he said take what you need so I washed
[46:59] my car like usual and on the last spot
[47:02] free rinse spray it shut off
[47:07] thank you
[47:08] [Applause]
[47:12] each night I specifically asked alert to
[47:15] speak directly to me and he did when
[47:18] brother Manuel preached she came right
[47:19] over here to my seat and he looked at me
[47:22] and he said
[47:24] you are the evidence and then again
[47:28] uh I got to stand as a Victor over
[47:31] cancer and he looked directly at me and
[47:34] said you are the evidence
[47:37] when brother Andrew preached he looked
[47:39] directly at me and said
[47:42] when you're down to nothing ain't that
[47:44] right sis that's when God works miracles
[47:48] so I fully believe God healed me
[47:52] of my ears my infection lots of things
[47:56] and there are many miracles coming for
[47:58] me
[47:59] I went through the prayer line and there
[48:01] were things I was praying for that were
[48:03] discerned and spoken
[48:07] um
[48:08] I'm working for the Red Sea to open wide
[48:10] and all of my enemies will be swallowed
[48:12] up so be prepared for me to flood the
[48:15] prayer page
[48:17] because no matter how great or small I
[48:19] will always tell her the goodness of God
[48:22] I appreciate brother Wendell for having
[48:24] the burden for these meetings
[48:29] and for all of the hard work
[48:33] that anyone put into them God bless Thee
[48:35] I love you all
[48:37] [Applause]
[48:44] right amen and Angie
[48:48] I like to say that the meetings
[48:51] it was so wonderful for me
[48:55] um
[48:56] at the beginning before it even started
[48:59] I told the Lord I said Lord anything you
[49:01] have for me
[49:03] give it to sister Angie
[49:06] because I knew she needed a miracle and
[49:10] she needed one bad
[49:13] but he didn't just give it to her he
[49:15] gave it to me too
[49:19] and I was so blessed why there it wasn't
[49:22] just one time but it was two times that
[49:25] the Lord blessed me so strong and when I
[49:29] was walking up to the prayer meeting or
[49:31] to the prayer line
[49:34] as Lord
[49:36] I asked for sister Angie but
[49:40] I'll take a little bit
[49:43] and he come on me and I couldn't hardly
[49:45] walk up to the prayer line I mean it the
[49:48] Lord reaches
[49:49] he was his presence was there so strong
[49:52] and there were some things that I've
[49:54] been reading in the Bible that that
[49:57] you know I had questions about that I
[49:59] didn't understand and the Lord revealed
[50:02] that too through the meeting through the
[50:04] brothers so I just thank him for all
[50:07] he's done
[50:08] [Applause]
[50:18] [Music]
[50:19] these meetings were phenomenal from the
[50:22] start to the finish and well it's still
[50:25] the Lord is still pouring out his
[50:27] blessings
[50:29] um every service
[50:31] everyone's been saying it's been
[50:34] um
[50:35] just Supernatural and that's really what
[50:37] I was praying for before the meetings
[50:38] just that the Lord would do something
[50:40] Supernatural for my family
[50:43] and for my husband and
[50:48] we just needed that
[50:50] from the Lord and
[50:53] um
[50:54] every service was the preaching was so
[50:57] powerful and the Lord just gave us so
[51:00] much Revelation and so much of that um
[51:05] that
[51:07] I I don't even know how to explain it
[51:09] just uh on Saturday we had to leave
[51:12] early to go unlock the building and
[51:14] start the food and and we got in the van
[51:16] and I was I told John I said my stomach
[51:19] feels
[51:20] heavy but like in a good way it's just
[51:22] like the
[51:24] it's so deep in there just the word that
[51:27] was being preached and it was like that
[51:31] each service and um and Thursday was
[51:35] extra special for me because
[51:39] at the end of the service brother Manuel
[51:42] was saying things that
[51:44] I've never spoken to anyone and I had
[51:47] been praying to the Lord about
[51:50] and it was so directly to me
[51:55] that I knew the Lord was right there
[51:57] saying I've got this and everything's
[51:59] gonna be okay
[52:02] and I know that and I hold on to that
[52:04] promise but when God just reminds you
[52:07] like he just speaks directly to you
[52:10] it's
[52:12] um it's super special
[52:15] and
[52:16] um I'm very glad to be a part of these
[52:18] meetings and part of this family here
[52:21] and I thank God so much for everything
[52:24] that he is doing
[52:33] wonderful
[52:36] praise the Lord Brother William
[52:39] [Music]
[52:42] Lord bless each every one of you this
[52:43] morning or this evening
[52:46] uh
[52:48] I
[52:52] I figured brother window was going to
[52:55] to open this up for a
[52:57] a testimony service and
[53:01] and uh
[53:03] I didn't know how I was going to say all
[53:04] this and
[53:08] I talked to a couple of the ministers
[53:11] over the weekend and asked him if they
[53:13] ever ministered
[53:16] and as a minister God was speaking to
[53:18] write directly to you on things in your
[53:22] own life that
[53:24] you were struggling
[53:26] and they said oh yeah
[53:29] so it kind of made me feel good because
[53:31] I was kind of
[53:33] shocked
[53:34] the Lord started blessing me on Sunday
[53:37] morning when I went and ministered for
[53:39] Brother by Ice
[53:42] I have been battling for a couple of
[53:44] years
[53:46] on depression
[53:49] and had some complexes
[53:52] that was
[53:54] driving me away from Pawnee
[53:57] I was
[53:59] very close of leaving
[54:02] you people that I loved dearly
[54:07] not one of you did anything to me
[54:10] I just got this complex on me
[54:14] and it was driving me insane
[54:18] I would fight and I was fighting it I'd
[54:21] come to church crying out to God asking
[54:23] him
[54:24] I know I was I was supposed to be here
[54:28] I knew that God sent me here Spirit very
[54:31] supernaturally
[54:33] uh
[54:35] if anybody knows me
[54:37] New Mexico is
[54:40] I'm New Mexico dirt
[54:43] and uh
[54:46] I never thought I'd ever sell my mom and
[54:48] dad's property and because it was my
[54:50] grandfather's
[54:52] and so I knew there was something on the
[54:54] inside of me
[54:55] I couldn't I didn't know what it was
[55:00] my family is the only one that was going
[55:03] through this struggle and
[55:05] a lot of the complexes was against
[55:07] brother Wendell
[55:10] and uh
[55:12] so Sunday morning when I ministered
[55:15] preach God is the savior
[55:17] from your fiery trials
[55:20] I read
[55:22] a few quotes about fiery trials and then
[55:26] what Hit me hard afterwards was when
[55:29] Sharon and I was coming home Sunday
[55:33] and she goes do you know God just
[55:36] answered some of your questions
[55:38] and I kind of looked at her and she went
[55:40] over some things that I said that I
[55:42] didn't remember that I said
[55:44] and one Proverbs 3
[55:47] says trust in the Lord with all thy
[55:50] heart
[55:53] and lean not unto your own understanding
[55:57] in all these ways acknowledge Him
[56:00] and he shall Direct by paths
[56:03] I tried with all my heart for the last
[56:06] couple years
[56:08] to go that direction
[56:11] and it was tough I was fighting
[56:15] so the next day or that evening
[56:18] I was pretty Disturbed
[56:21] because I didn't think I had these
[56:23] complexes
[56:25] I
[56:26] actually went to our deacon
[56:29] and I went over to his house and I
[56:31] poured my gut out to him
[56:33] and uh
[56:36] I think you guys gotta we gotta find
[56:37] very fine Deacon back there in the back
[56:40] there
[56:42] stay neutral
[56:45] spoke to my heart
[56:47] gave me a little bit of things I can
[56:49] chew on and certain things that he said
[56:52] it was what I was preaching on that
[56:53] morning
[56:55] that's along the way home that night
[56:58] me and my wife and my two kids we we got
[57:02] home and me and Sharon stayed up and we
[57:04] talked
[57:07] and then the next day
[57:09] the Lord was just dealing with my heart
[57:11] on certain things
[57:14] and uh I got just looking through some
[57:17] of my notes when me and Sharon was
[57:19] talking and
[57:21] and one of the quotes that really hit me
[57:24] hard
[57:25] on Tuesday says god let's discipline
[57:28] disappointment
[57:31] happen to show victory
[57:34] many
[57:35] has been the trials of heartaches
[57:38] hardship but today
[57:42] we're more than conquerors in Christ
[57:44] Jesus
[57:46] Saturday Tuesday night I just
[57:49] told God I said Lord
[57:52] I don't care what it takes kill me
[57:55] speak to my heart
[57:57] brother Wendell seen all of us say texts
[58:00] and told us we should listen to uh
[58:04] what is the Holy Ghost for and I
[58:07] listened to it like two weeks three
[58:09] weeks ago before then
[58:11] but I was just listening I wasn't paying
[58:13] attention
[58:15] and I started listening to that message
[58:18] and I started realizing that I am a son
[58:21] of God
[58:22] and I don't need these complexes
[58:24] while I was sitting there by myself
[58:26] working
[58:28] I totally died out to God I said Lord I
[58:31] don't want nothing to hinder me
[58:33] in these meetings
[58:34] I want to be able to look at my pastor I
[58:37] want to be able to look at each and
[58:39] everyone in this church and know for a
[58:41] shadow of a doubt I wouldn't have these
[58:43] complexes anymore
[58:46] and uh
[58:47] and so Wednesday night I was going to go
[58:50] talk to brother window first but
[58:52] we just never had the time to get to him
[58:54] and he had he was with his ministers and
[58:57] things like that and so when the brother
[59:00] was preaching
[59:02] I was fixing to walk out when he
[59:05] asked everybody to come and when I stood
[59:08] right there
[59:10] there was a voice that came out of that
[59:12] picture right there
[59:14] says you need to go tell him the
[59:16] complexes that you have
[59:18] and you'll have victory
[59:21] I walked over there and poor brother
[59:23] Wendell he was praying and he was
[59:25] probably asking whatever for himself and
[59:28] I put my hands upon him when he looked
[59:30] at me I startled him
[59:32] and I just told him that I was sorry and
[59:34] it's forgiveness
[59:37] that I had these complexes for the last
[59:39] two years and I felt like somebody was
[59:41] going to drive me away from this place
[59:43] it wasn't a human
[59:45] I realized it was the devil
[59:48] and when I realized that that night
[59:51] totally truly when I walked away from
[59:54] Brother window I don't know how I got
[59:55] from there to there because I was
[59:57] shaking so bad
[59:59] but since then all through the services
[1:00:01] God was just vindicating you vindicating
[1:00:04] and vindicating communicating and I can
[1:00:07] just feel like that old truck with a gas
[1:00:10] tank that was just getting filled here
[1:00:12] and filled and filled and filled until
[1:00:14] the back end was getting full the front
[1:00:17] end was getting full the front tires
[1:00:19] were getting full
[1:00:21] day I could tell each and every one of
[1:00:22] you that I'm sorry
[1:00:24] for even letting the devil give me that
[1:00:27] complex
[1:00:28] but today I can tell you that I love
[1:00:30] each and every one of you with all my
[1:00:32] heart
[1:00:33] God bless you
[1:00:42] amen are you enjoying these testimonies

[1:05:11] like to open the floor again is there
[1:05:13] anyone else that has a special or a
[1:05:16] testimony
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:20] God bless you Sister Sharon
[1:05:23] Well everybody's known what I've went
[1:05:24] through over the last year with this um
[1:05:27] what they finally called loan covered
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:32] um when Robert and Brianna was living
[1:05:34] across the street just to walk from
[1:05:35] their house to our house I would be so
[1:05:38] out of breath
[1:05:40] and so
[1:05:43] right before we were supposed to go on
[1:05:45] our trip a month ago
[1:05:48] I had already been on another round of
[1:05:50] medication and she gave me some more
[1:05:53] stuff to take with me just in case I
[1:05:55] needed it while we were gone
[1:05:57] and
[1:05:59] when we had planned this trip in January
[1:06:04] we planned it to do a lot of hiking and
[1:06:06] so
[1:06:07] when I went to the doctor that was
[1:06:09] supposed to be a well check two weeks
[1:06:12] before we were supposed to
[1:06:14] go
[1:06:16] um I didn't even know I was sick again
[1:06:17] and she told me I had bronchitis again
[1:06:20] so then I told kind of just popped off
[1:06:22] and told her told William well I guess
[1:06:24] we may have to change what we're going
[1:06:25] to do
[1:06:27] well then right before we left
[1:06:30] I told him I said well I'm not going to
[1:06:32] take this last little bit of medication
[1:06:34] before we go because it's going to make
[1:06:36] me feel bad
[1:06:37] and I said we're just going to keep the
[1:06:39] plans as they are I said I know the
[1:06:41] Lord's going to heal me
[1:06:44] so while we was on that trip every day
[1:06:46] we did hiking I never felt short of
[1:06:48] breath one day we even hiked for seven
[1:06:50] miles I never felt short of breath
[1:06:53] and
[1:06:55] even though I knew that the Lord healed
[1:06:57] me
[1:06:57] just to see that manifested I was just
[1:07:00] like wow
[1:07:02] and so they had scheduled me
[1:07:05] out you know an appointment like two
[1:07:08] months one or two months out and it was
[1:07:11] going to be for when we actually got
[1:07:12] back that they wanted me to do a lung
[1:07:14] function test
[1:07:16] and
[1:07:18] in my heart I said it doesn't matter
[1:07:20] if it's clear or if it shows something I
[1:07:24] said if it's clear I said already know
[1:07:26] the Lord's healed me so that's just
[1:07:27] going to be proof I said but if it shows
[1:07:30] something there
[1:07:31] I said I still don't know the Lord
[1:07:34] healed me but it's also going to be
[1:07:36] proof for when I do go back and get
[1:07:37] another test that that test is going to
[1:07:40] show clear and that will show that the
[1:07:42] Lord's healed me
[1:07:43] so I went and had that lung function
[1:07:46] test and of course the doctor's report
[1:07:48] says that
[1:07:49] I have mild obstruction like lung
[1:07:52] disease or something
[1:07:55] and
[1:07:56] that my lungs do not fully
[1:08:01] release all of the air it's like it
[1:08:03] holds the air pocket in there
[1:08:06] but no matter what the doctor's report
[1:08:08] says I know the Lord healed me
[1:08:10] and before our trip something told me
[1:08:12] well you just need to wait till the
[1:08:14] meetings and the Lord will heal you I
[1:08:16] said no I don't need to wait till the
[1:08:18] meetings I know the Lord Can Heal Me Now
[1:08:20] and I believe he did that and through
[1:08:22] the meetings I just believe it which is
[1:08:24] confirmation of what the Lord's already
[1:08:25] done
[1:08:28] [Applause]
[1:08:35] amen that's wonderful amen
[1:08:38] anybody else sister Brianna
[1:08:46] um so I actually got two testimonies
[1:08:50] um
[1:08:51] well I guess three
[1:08:54] um when we were moving from our house
[1:08:57] across the street from my mom and dad
[1:08:59] the main reason we moved was because of
[1:09:02] the mold in the house was going to be
[1:09:05] very expensive to fix and we just didn't
[1:09:07] have that money
[1:09:09] on top of being able to buy it so we
[1:09:12] decided to go ahead and rent from
[1:09:14] Michael and Amy
[1:09:16] so
[1:09:19] there was going to be like a month Gap
[1:09:20] where we would stay with Mom and Dad
[1:09:22] between moving from one house to the
[1:09:24] other
[1:09:25] and it seemed like the moment we made
[1:09:28] that decision
[1:09:29] the devil was mad he did not like it
[1:09:33] um
[1:09:34] are your landlords at the time
[1:09:38] completely morphed into
[1:09:41] beings we didn't even know they could be
[1:09:45] they were threatening to sue us for
[1:09:47] damages that weren't even there
[1:09:50] they were calling my dad they were
[1:09:53] harassing Robert myself
[1:09:57] um they were even going as far as to go
[1:10:00] to the bank and ask questions that were
[1:10:02] confidential questions
[1:10:05] um and it got to the point where we
[1:10:07] decided we had to go to a lawyer and we
[1:10:10] turned out we couldn't even use that
[1:10:12] lawyer because he was a lawyer of theirs
[1:10:14] as well and so we were just kind of
[1:10:17] I was
[1:10:20] at first I was freaking out but then it
[1:10:22] was like a piece came over me I was just
[1:10:24] like
[1:10:25] I got this ear anchor holds
[1:10:29] I got it
[1:10:30] and I'm like this is not like me
[1:10:33] I like to freak out I am a warrior
[1:10:36] I overthink everything that's always my
[1:10:39] problem
[1:10:40] and
[1:10:43] we were receiving letters from the
[1:10:45] landlords that just kept piling up
[1:10:46] piling up piling up and I'm like what in
[1:10:49] the world
[1:10:50] did I do to upset the devil
[1:10:53] and
[1:10:57] out of nowhere I received a text from
[1:10:59] the landlord's apologizing
[1:11:02] saying they were wrong
[1:11:04] that they didn't know why they were even
[1:11:06] saying what they were saying
[1:11:09] that and we haven't heard from them
[1:11:12] since we've seen them in public they've
[1:11:15] smiled at us they have asked how we were
[1:11:17] doing they've asked about the church we
[1:11:19] have never had a problem again
[1:11:21] yeah
[1:11:23] and it just blew my mind how one minute
[1:11:26] they could it seemed like it was going
[1:11:28] completely South
[1:11:30] I'm like I am 22 years old I'm going to
[1:11:32] be facing a lawsuit what in the world
[1:11:35] to God completely just wiping it away as
[1:11:37] if it never happened
[1:11:40] and then
[1:11:42] um
[1:11:43] last Sunday before the meetings
[1:11:46] I had been dealing with nightmares
[1:11:49] I have always kind of dealt with them at
[1:11:52] certain times in my life when certain
[1:11:54] things bothered me
[1:11:56] as a kid
[1:11:58] um
[1:11:59] but the dreams that I had been having it
[1:12:01] was the same dream over and over again
[1:12:02] it just had different people in it and
[1:12:04] it was just really bothering me I had
[1:12:06] talked to Robert about it I talked to a
[1:12:08] few other people and I just I'm like I
[1:12:10] have I don't know what's going on you
[1:12:12] know I would try to pray before I went
[1:12:14] to bed and read my Bible and just really
[1:12:16] just
[1:12:18] you know make sure that I wasn't doing
[1:12:20] it like watching anything or accepting
[1:12:22] myself to anything that I shouldn't
[1:12:25] well
[1:12:27] um
[1:12:27] so Sunday I went uh whenever where the
[1:12:30] window was preaching and we all went up
[1:12:32] to
[1:12:35] [Music]
[1:12:35] um
[1:12:36] you know rededicate our lives the Lord
[1:12:38] before the meetings
[1:12:40] I heard this little it's like an
[1:12:42] antagonizing the most annoying voice
[1:12:43] I've ever heard in my head
[1:12:45] tell me throughout all the meetings I am
[1:12:48] going to torture you with you're never
[1:12:49] going to get sleep you're just going to
[1:12:51] be worn out after the meetings you're
[1:12:53] not going to enjoy it you're just gonna
[1:12:56] and I'm just like what no
[1:12:59] and I said Lord that's it
[1:13:02] I'm gonna enjoy these meetings I'm gonna
[1:13:04] get sleep I'm not gonna have these
[1:13:07] nightmares and I haven't had another one
[1:13:09] since
[1:13:16] and then
[1:13:18] um
[1:13:19] every night every service was a blessing
[1:13:22] and Friday
[1:13:25] I was not feeling good
[1:13:27] um at all
[1:13:29] so I came to church kind of just
[1:13:31] um
[1:13:32] like you know Lord I'm really gonna have
[1:13:33] to press through this service
[1:13:35] and it's like during the service the
[1:13:37] devil was just fighting me with sleep
[1:13:39] and I'm just like I'm not gonna
[1:13:41] I'm just gonna keep pressing through and
[1:13:43] so I just focusing extra hard
[1:13:46] and then about after about 30 minutes
[1:13:48] into the message
[1:13:50] it was like I felt like brother Daryl
[1:13:53] not by Daryl brother Jonathan
[1:13:56] was reading my mind
[1:13:59] some of the past situations that I've
[1:14:01] dealt with with a critical spirit with
[1:14:04] bitterness with complexes that I didn't
[1:14:06] even realize were bothering me as much
[1:14:08] as they had
[1:14:11] and it was almost a before he even
[1:14:13] called the musicians it was like
[1:14:14] something and he just wanted to run to
[1:14:16] the altar
[1:14:18] and when he called the musicians up and
[1:14:21] we all stood
[1:14:22] I didn't hesitate I went straight up
[1:14:25] there
[1:14:26] and I felt the Lord just touched me so
[1:14:28] strong
[1:14:30] and I felt like there was this like it
[1:14:32] was just like it just I didn't feel no
[1:14:35] one around me it was like it was just me
[1:14:37] alone with God in a room by ourselves
[1:14:42] and it was like wave after wave you know
[1:14:44] and then I finally felt like I'm like
[1:14:46] Lord thank you for this touch and I was
[1:14:48] just about
[1:14:50] to go I was came back to and I was
[1:14:52] fixing to go
[1:14:54] sit back down and I felt brother
[1:14:56] Jonathan grab a hold of me
[1:14:58] and he just started praying for me and
[1:15:00] it was like he was in my mind and we
[1:15:02] were just praying together
[1:15:05] and I just felt that dagger that was in
[1:15:07] my heart just causing me to have
[1:15:10] bitterness and strife and thoughts about
[1:15:13] people that I love and I care about
[1:15:16] gone
[1:15:18] and it's just the most wonderful
[1:15:21] peace and it's just I love everybody
[1:15:24] without having to look at that person
[1:15:26] and feel fake
[1:15:28] and it's just the most wonderful feeling
[1:15:30] I've ever felt in my life
[1:15:34] [Applause]
[1:15:43] amen that's good
[1:15:45] yes brother William
[1:16:24] yes sir
[1:16:29] amen
[1:16:30] amen I've enjoyed these These are good
[1:16:34] amen anyone what else
[1:16:38] we got time so brother brother Caleb
[1:16:40] Fairweather
[1:16:43] amen Lord bless him
[1:16:55] [Applause]
[1:16:58] so for a little while now
[1:17:02] I've been dealing with quite a lot just
[1:17:06] feeling completely dead
[1:17:11] nothing
[1:17:12] of the past Services before the meetings
[1:17:16] spoke to me I just
[1:17:20] felt like I didn't have any more
[1:17:22] emotions at all or just
[1:17:25] anything
[1:17:28] and
[1:17:30] the meetings were a blessing
[1:17:34] but Monday night
[1:17:37] I went to
[1:17:39] my grandma's house after work
[1:17:43] and they were listening to a brother
[1:17:46] Kenny Capps message
[1:17:49] and he was just telling these stories
[1:17:51] and I was listening
[1:17:54] but near the end he talked about how he
[1:17:57] accepted God into his heart
[1:18:00] he said he went to
[1:18:02] cornfield and just
[1:18:05] asked him Lord if you come into my heart
[1:18:09] that
[1:18:11] I will live for you
[1:18:15] and
[1:18:16] the message had ended
[1:18:20] and then I left for home
[1:18:24] but
[1:18:25] I was about two feet away from my truck
[1:18:27] and just
[1:18:32] I just kind of stood there for a minute
[1:18:33] looked around
[1:18:37] and I was saying God I don't feel like
[1:18:40] I've rightfully asked you in my heart
[1:18:45] I don't feel like I've been who you
[1:18:47] wanted me to be
[1:18:51] and I asked him Lord if you come into my
[1:18:53] heart I will sing you a song
[1:18:56] just more powerful than anything that
[1:18:59] I've ever sang in my life
[1:19:03] and
[1:19:06] I got in the truck
[1:19:08] and the song before brother Kenny Capps
[1:19:11] had dismissed with was Amazing Grace
[1:19:15] it was just going in my mind and I found
[1:19:20] a song
[1:19:22] of that and
[1:19:27] as soon as it just
[1:19:30] played I just sat there for
[1:19:33] at least 10 minutes
[1:19:36] I was just
[1:19:37] staring out the window
[1:19:39] I knew of God's presence had come down
[1:19:44] I was just saying oh God
[1:19:49] please be my friend
[1:19:57] just on the way home I kept saying oh
[1:20:00] God oh God
[1:20:04] just
[1:20:06] ever since then I've
[1:20:09] been so much different
[1:20:13] I know he's coming to my heart
[1:20:19] can we get the words to Amazing Grace
[1:20:21] please
[1:20:25] [Applause]
[1:20:35] Amazing Grace
[1:20:40] how sweet
[1:20:43] the sound
[1:20:46] that same
[1:20:50] [Music]
[1:20:51] like me
[1:20:57] I want
[1:21:00] once was lost
[1:21:03] but now
[1:21:06] I'm found
[1:21:09] I was blind but now
[1:21:15] I see
[1:21:21] since it was
[1:21:22] Grace
[1:21:24] that
[1:21:25] taught
[1:21:27] my heart
[1:21:30] diffuse
[1:21:33] angry
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:21:36] my
[1:21:38] fears really
[1:21:44] how proud
[1:21:47] precious did
[1:21:50] thy Grace
[1:21:53] appear
[1:21:56] they are
[1:21:59] I

[1:40:14] brother Mitch
[1:40:16] amen God bless you now
[1:40:38] okay never good at these things
[1:40:42] I have a couple try and be quick
[1:40:44] um wasn't sure I was going to be able to
[1:40:46] give a testimony until Caleb gave his
[1:40:50] uh he told me a few days ago
[1:40:53] a couple days ago and uh but really mine
[1:40:57] started
[1:40:58] uh whether John Torrance was preaching
[1:41:02] here a while back and uh
[1:41:07] I was at home at my kitchen table
[1:41:09] watching the service and going through
[1:41:12] my troubles and stuff and I've just had
[1:41:15] quite a few everything hit all at once
[1:41:18] and it's been pretty devastating and
[1:41:22] uh
[1:41:23] you're praying through then brother
[1:41:26] John's preaching and so we need to have
[1:41:29] that confidence in everybody else's
[1:41:31] prayers as well as our own and
[1:41:34] as well as to God and it really sunk
[1:41:38] into me and I really started believing
[1:41:41] for everything
[1:41:43] improving everybody's doing
[1:41:45] and
[1:41:46] you know we went to Seattle and
[1:41:50] when we got back
[1:41:53] um
[1:41:54] I called my brother
[1:41:56] the next day and they was taking my mom
[1:41:59] to the hospital
[1:42:00] I said what's going on nobody called me
[1:42:04] he said well
[1:42:05] she was having dizzy spell they they
[1:42:07] pretty much thought she had a stroke
[1:42:10] and so I had to put the post on the
[1:42:15] prayer request and it was right at that
[1:42:18] time they were just pulling in when I
[1:42:21] called them and and uh
[1:42:25] um
[1:42:25] so I don't know how many people got to
[1:42:27] pray or
[1:42:29] um look at it or or what but
[1:42:32] I believe that you know
[1:42:34] I told my brother I said I'm going to
[1:42:36] put that I'm putting this on the prayer
[1:42:38] page at our church
[1:42:40] so you know
[1:42:41] and they took her to the hospital
[1:42:44] and about an hour later I got the call
[1:42:46] back
[1:42:47] they couldn't find nothing
[1:42:49] there was nothing
[1:42:51] and it's not like them to just run to a
[1:42:54] hospital and you know get all excited
[1:42:57] about this if they there was something
[1:42:58] wrong
[1:43:00] and God had healed it
[1:43:04] and then the meetings
[1:43:07] tremendous
[1:43:09] in
[1:43:11] all my life I never liked riding the
[1:43:14] bench
[1:43:16] I I always I got to be doing something I
[1:43:19] want to you know whether it's playing
[1:43:21] sports or working or doing something and
[1:43:25] then when I gave my heart to Lauren uh
[1:43:28] turn my life over for him to do
[1:43:30] missionary work with I just
[1:43:33] this has been a really hard time you
[1:43:36] know I I haven't been myself I haven't
[1:43:38] been able to do certain things I thought
[1:43:40] well what can I do I
[1:43:42] you know tried to find something nothing
[1:43:45] was really working
[1:43:46] I called brother Wendell up and
[1:43:50] I said can I take you out to dinner
[1:43:51] before the meetings start
[1:43:53] take you to a real nice steak dinner
[1:43:55] just do something nice
[1:43:57] I could do that
[1:43:59] and
[1:44:00] so we went out to dinner and then he had
[1:44:04] mentioned it
[1:44:05] he was given his car
[1:44:08] to somebody to drive and that he was
[1:44:11] going to be driving his truck
[1:44:13] and I went really
[1:44:16] I've been a detailer my whole life
[1:44:19] under my dad's thumb
[1:44:21] I've washed all his trucks work trucks
[1:44:24] cars everything else and so I'm pretty
[1:44:28] good at it and then nowadays it got
[1:44:30] easier chemicals and stuff to use so I
[1:44:34] said look
[1:44:35] you need to put your keys in your truck
[1:44:37] and I'm going to take your truck
[1:44:38] tomorrow
[1:44:39] and
[1:44:41] and so they did I was very blessed for
[1:44:44] it and
[1:44:46] um it went went very well we were able
[1:44:48] to get the truck cleaned up
[1:44:52] presentable for sister Fresca so she
[1:44:54] could
[1:44:55] be comfortable during the meetings and
[1:44:59] you know it's it blessed me I I really
[1:45:03] wanted to do something
[1:45:05] and I'm glad it blessed them
[1:45:09] and uh
[1:45:11] you know
[1:45:13] there's so much God does
[1:45:16] for each one and
[1:45:18] me and Caleb been kind of going through
[1:45:19] it no not really hard but I mean I could
[1:45:23] tell he there was something bothering
[1:45:25] him too and he he wouldn't quite open up
[1:45:28] too much and then one night he did open
[1:45:31] up and
[1:45:33] and he said he just didn't know anymore
[1:45:37] and we had a really long talk and
[1:45:40] and I told him just just trust the Lord
[1:45:43] you know
[1:45:45] he'll bring you through it you know and
[1:45:48] just remember if God is God serve him
[1:45:51] and
[1:45:53] doing everything I could to encourage
[1:45:56] him you know and
[1:45:57] um
[1:45:59] see him come through the prayer line
[1:46:03] uh Saturday night
[1:46:06] I went through first
[1:46:08] am I seeing him back there and he's
[1:46:11] I knew he wanted to go through
[1:46:14] and uh when he went through it was just
[1:46:16] tremendous just each and everyone that
[1:46:18] prayed for him and laid hands on him
[1:46:21] went through there you could feel the
[1:46:24] anointing the healing coming off and uh
[1:46:28] you know and I
[1:46:30] I know All the Troubles I'm going
[1:46:31] through and I know God's going to heal
[1:46:33] me I had to go to the doctor the other
[1:46:35] day and
[1:46:36] and uh
[1:46:38] he wanted to know the story and I told
[1:46:40] him and I said well I was on disability
[1:46:42] for two years
[1:46:44] and I was to collect my back pay and
[1:46:47] then God healed my lower back from bone
[1:46:50] spurs and and that was a tremendous
[1:46:53] healing and I told the doctor this
[1:46:56] and said so
[1:46:59] what I'm doing now is just anything I
[1:47:02] need to do to to kind of calm those
[1:47:05] things so I can
[1:47:06] get back Rolling On My Feet Again
[1:47:09] but I said I'm really
[1:47:11] I'm just waiting for the Lord to heal my
[1:47:14] back again
[1:47:15] and he was like wow you know
[1:47:18] I said well the healing of my lower back
[1:47:20] was tremendous
[1:47:22] there's you know
[1:47:24] nothing shy of a major miracle and
[1:47:30] to see what he's done for my family and
[1:47:32] stuff just coming here
[1:47:35] I like to say brother William
[1:47:44] a Christian Life is living for others
[1:47:47] it was nothing short
[1:47:51] of you coming to Washington and helping
[1:47:53] me move to get our stuff here
[1:47:56] what I would have to go through if you
[1:48:00] hadn't listened and gave your life
[1:48:06] don't ever tell yourself Satan has the
[1:48:09] same tactics
[1:48:10] but you know what you're a Christian
[1:48:13] you live a Christian Life
[1:48:16] you live for others
[1:48:18] I see it throughout the church
[1:48:21] everybody's life and
[1:48:25] all sometimes sit and feel ashamed
[1:48:28] because I'm not doing enough and
[1:48:32] you know
[1:48:37] just love where we're at
[1:48:39] I love being here
[1:48:41] I love to have my family here
[1:48:44] to see my daughter and
[1:48:48] soon to be husband
[1:48:50] up singing a song
[1:48:52] during the meetings tremendous
[1:48:56] a couple days ago my son walked through
[1:48:58] the door of our house crying
[1:49:02] speechless
[1:49:04] without words
[1:49:06] what do you do as a dad you're like
[1:49:08] okay what's going on
[1:49:11] you okay
[1:49:13] did something happen
[1:49:15] and he told me
[1:49:17] God came in his heart
[1:49:21] I remember when my daughter came home
[1:49:23] from Stillwater camp
[1:49:27] what's good Stillwater camp
[1:49:30] told me she got the Holy Ghost
[1:49:32] God came in our heart
[1:49:34] revealed to him that he knew exactly who
[1:49:37] she was
[1:49:38] he's an owner his whole life her whole
[1:49:41] life

[1:50:54] had a burden for them and seeing them
[1:50:56] getting touched or at least meetings
[1:50:58] really done my heart good amen also um
[1:51:02] getting to see my children touched as
[1:51:04] well how to compliment on on simeon's
[1:51:07] standing over here I don't even know if
[1:51:08] he knew what he was a Manning but they
[1:51:10] were people were saying he just looks
[1:51:12] like a little man standing up here just
[1:51:13] standing and praising the Lord so as a
[1:51:16] father it does my heart good too
[1:51:18] to see my kids even though they don't
[1:51:20] know really what's going on but to see
[1:51:23] that they're really soft and sensitive
[1:51:24] and to the Lord it really it's a
[1:51:26] blessing amen God bless sister Tabitha
[1:51:32] my testimony kind of goes along
[1:51:35] with what you're just saying and it's
[1:51:37] not even really my testimony so much
[1:51:39] although I saw
[1:51:41] and felt
[1:51:43] awesome things this this last week it
[1:51:46] was amazing like everybody says start to
[1:51:48] finish but
[1:51:50] um
[1:51:52] one thing that I guess impressed me the
[1:51:56] most
[1:51:57] out of all of it
[1:52:00] um
[1:52:02] my boss opened up her house as
[1:52:07] many of you all know Suzanne opened up
[1:52:10] her house to
[1:52:12] the young ladies
[1:52:13] to stay there during the meetings and
[1:52:17] she's pretty sociable she likes to talk
[1:52:19] to him and and get to know him and stuff
[1:52:21] it's just her personality and
[1:52:24] and I dropped off a couple of them the
[1:52:28] holderness girls I dropped him off after

[1:59:30] doing in in each of our lives and how
[1:59:34] that we are Overcoming By the blood of
[1:59:37] the Lamb by the word of Our Testimony
[1:59:40] amen and um these Services were just so
[1:59:45] refreshing to me
[1:59:47] and and I tell you all of the ministers
[1:59:50] they just all every one of them were
[1:59:53] just said they were so blessed to be
[1:59:55] here
[1:59:56] and so many were thankful for the uh for
[2:00:01] all the labors to put it on and we were
[2:00:03] just so thankful and I appreciate
[2:00:07] Olive all of the hard work that that
[2:00:10] went into the uh to the meeting
[2:00:13] and what a blessing what a blessing amen
[2:00:17] it's just just tremendous
[2:00:20] and with them with the ministers being
[2:00:22] over there in in Still Water It Takes Me
[2:00:24] Away a lot from the
[2:00:27] from the daily activities it seemed like
[2:00:29] we were leaving here at 10 30 or 11 and
[2:00:32] not getting back until sometimes four
[2:00:35] o'clock and and
[2:00:38] um
[2:00:38] and so I didn't get to have uh you know
[2:00:41] just seemed like I I didn't get to do
[2:00:43] too much out over there at the
[2:00:45] fellowship hall but everything just kept
[2:00:46] running smoothly and and we just
[2:00:49] appreciate all of you all of you amen
[2:00:54] praise the Lord
[2:00:56] and you know life is full of life is
[2:01:00] full of uh heartaches and the devil is
[2:01:03] fighting and I just want to say you know
[2:01:07] um going to what brother William was
[2:01:09] saying
[2:01:10] you know those those are real battles
[2:01:12] those complexes and and Satan will try
[2:01:14] to build bitterness between any of us
[2:01:16] and all of us
[2:01:18] but and a lot of times you'll try to
[2:01:20] build that between especially a leader
[2:01:23] uh you know when the devil can because I
[2:01:27] can have a heart that is that is pure
[2:01:29] that that genuinely loves but and if the
[2:01:32] devil's beating on you
[2:01:34] you need we need to talk to one another
[2:01:36] and don't let that thing faster that
[2:01:39] goes for you that goes for you children
[2:01:41] to your parents
[2:01:43] that goes for wives to husbands
[2:01:47] that goes between others should be a
[2:01:49] communication we should feel free to
[2:01:52] communicate between one another because
[2:01:54] I promise you the devil is is is trying
[2:01:58] to cause friction between that's why we
[2:02:01] get divorces that's why we have church
[2:02:03] splits that's why we have all of these
[2:02:04] things here and so no one should be
[2:02:07] above even with me and brother William
[2:02:09] you know there's nothing for president
[2:02:11] there's nothing wrong with brother
[2:02:12] William coming talking to me and um and
[2:02:15] if I'm if if if if if I'm what I need to
[2:02:19] be I'll sit and listen amen and that's
[2:02:22] that's what we're here for we are all
[2:02:24] for one another
[2:02:26] we all love one another and so there is
[2:02:30] no big means and little U's or big U's
[2:02:34] and little me's we're all here together
[2:02:38] and so amen it's real it's real what the
[2:02:43] devil does and tries to put in between
[2:02:44] us is very real and and we can't allow
[2:02:48] that and so and if someone ever does
[2:02:50] come to you don't take that personal
[2:02:53] you know because in there and there and
[2:02:55] if there's something you need to repent
[2:02:57] of you need to repent of it if they come
[2:02:59] up and tell you you've done something to
[2:03:00] hurt then and and that's the way I want
[2:03:03] to be I want to be
[2:03:05] I want to be that kind of a person to to
[2:03:09] be willing to repent when I'm wrong and
[2:03:13] um and so
[2:03:15] um but I'm I'm thankful that we can we
[2:03:18] can talk and we can uh
[2:03:22] forgive and that we can't encourage and
[2:03:25] we can't do those things because I I
[2:03:27] tell you what we are in The Last Mile
[2:03:30] friends
[2:03:31] amen and Satan fights and
[2:03:35] brother will you make the only one that
[2:03:36] gets fought I get fought too and lots of
[2:03:39] times you can you can you can get it put
[2:03:41] under the blood and you can you can
[2:03:42] resist it and and put it under the blood
[2:03:45] and it's all it's all taken care of you
[2:03:47] don't have to go to that person
[2:03:48] amen but sometimes it's just good to
[2:03:51] just go and say all right I've been
[2:03:52] trying to get rid of this and I just
[2:03:54] can't do it so here we are amen I think
[2:03:57] you're a nut amen
[2:03:59] and whatever and uh and and get it and
[2:04:04] and get it over can you say man
