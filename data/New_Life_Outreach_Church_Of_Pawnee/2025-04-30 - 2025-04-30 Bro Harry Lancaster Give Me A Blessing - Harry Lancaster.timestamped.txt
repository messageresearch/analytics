[3:10] Now I can't
[3:12] feel. I want to run to
[3:16] you with heart wide
[3:20] open. Lord, make me
[3:24] broken. Make me
[3:26] [Music]
[3:27] empty so I can be filled.
[3:32] I've been
[3:34] holding on to my

[4:20] lonely so I can be
[4:24] yours. So I want no
[4:27] one more than you,
[4:30] Lord. Cuz in the

[5:30] open. Lord make me broken.
[5:35] [Music]

[6:31] Just praise God for letting us be
[6:34] gathered again here
[6:37] [Music]
[6:40] today. Let's just be prepared to meet
[6:43] him here. Anything can
[6:45] [Music]
[6:54] happen.
[6:55] [Music]
[7:00] Amazing
[7:03] grace, how
[7:06] [Music]
[7:09] sweet that
[7:12] save a
[7:14] rich like me.
[7:21] I
[7:22] once was
[7:25] lost, but
[7:28] now I'm
[7:31] found. I was
[7:34] blind, but
[7:37] now I
[7:42] see. It was
[7:45] grace that
[7:48] taught my
[7:51] heart to
[7:54] feel and
[7:57] embrace my
[7:58] [Music]
[8:00] fears relief.
[8:02] [Music]
[8:06] How
[8:06] [Music]
[8:08] precious
[8:10] did that
[8:14] grace appear?
[8:16] [Music]
[8:20] I
[8:21] first
[8:23] [Music]
[8:27] believe
[8:31] no
[8:33] dangerous
[8:36] toys and snares.
[8:39] might
[8:41] have
[8:44] already
[8:49] come. His
[8:51] grace hath
[8:54] brought me
[8:57] safe thus
[9:00] far. And
[9:02] grace will
[9:05] lead me home.
[9:12] When
[9:13] we've been
[9:16] there
[9:20] 10,000
[9:22] years, bright
[9:25] shineing
[9:27] as the sun.
[9:31] [Music]
[9:34] We've
[9:35] no less
[9:38] days to
[9:41] sing God's
[9:44] praise than
[9:46] when we
[9:49] first
[9:51] [Music]
[9:54] began. Praise
[9:57] God. Praise
[10:00] God. Praise God.
[10:03] Praise
[10:05] God. Praise
[10:08] God. Praise
[10:11] God. Praise
[10:13] [Music]
[10:16] God. Praise
[10:19] God. Praise
[10:21] God. Praise
[10:24] God. Praise
[10:27] God. Praise
[10:29] God. Praise God. God. Praise
[10:38] [Music]
[10:45] God. So many so many times.
[10:49] Question certain
[10:52] circumstances, things I could
[10:55] not understand.
[11:01] And many times in
[11:03] trials, my weakness blurs, my
[11:07] vision, my frustration gets so out of
[11:14] hand. And it's then I am
[11:18] reminded I'm never
[11:22] forsaken. Never had to stand one test
[11:28] alone. Cuz when I look at all the
[11:33] victories, the spirit rises up in me.
[11:37] And it's through the fire my weakness is
[11:41] made
[11:43] [Music]
[11:44] strong. Cuz he never promised that the
[11:49] cross would not get
[11:51] heavy and the hill would not be hard to
[11:56] climb.
[11:57] [Music]
[12:00] And he never
[12:02] offered a victory without fighting. But
[12:06] he said help would always come in
[12:12] time. And just remember when you are
[12:16] standing in the valley of
[12:20] decision and the adversary says give in.
[12:27] Just hold
[12:29] on and our Lord will show
[12:33] up and he will take you through the fire
[12:40] [Music]
[12:42] again. So many times I've
[12:45] questioned certain
[12:48] circumstances and things I could not
[12:52] understand.
[12:57] And many times in
[12:59] trials, my weakness blurs my
[13:03] vision and my frustration gets so out of
[13:10] hand. And it's then I am
[13:14] reminded I've never been
[13:17] forsaken. I've never had to stand one
[13:21] test alone.
[13:25] When I look at all the
[13:28] victories, the spirit rises up in me.
[13:33] It's through the fire my weakness is
[13:36] made
[13:39] strong. Cuz he never promised that the
[13:44] cross would not get heavy and the hill
[13:48] would not be hard to climb.
[13:53] [Music]
[13:55] And he never
[13:57] offered victories without fighting. But
[14:01] he said help would always come in
[14:07] time. And just remember when you're
[14:11] standing in the valley of
[14:15] decision and the adversary says give
[14:20] in. Just hold
[14:24] on. And our Lord will show
[14:28] up and he will take you through the fire
[14:33] again.
[14:35] Just hold
[14:38] on and our Lord will show
[14:42] up and he will take you through the fire
[14:51] again. Praise the
[14:56] Lord. Just thank you all for being here.
[15:01] And there are those of us who are
[15:02] missing on the meetings or just at home
[15:06] feeling sick. There are no prayer
[15:08] requests today, but in our hearts, I
[15:11] know that there's something for
[15:14] everybody.
[15:15] Just ask God what you will. And he said
[15:19] he'll grant you whatever, just whatever
[15:22] you have need
[15:23] of. And if I may, I'd like to ask
[15:26] brother Miguel if you wouldn't mind
[15:27] coming up to pray.
[15:32] Just want to thank God for all he's done
[15:34] for
[15:35] us, especially for
[15:37] [Music]
[15:39] me. Amen. You love him here this
[15:42] evening. Happy to be in the house of the
[15:44] Lord. Amen. We're just going to be in
[15:47] prayer for everybody. And uh we just bow
[15:49] our heads and our hearts for this
[15:51] evening. Heavenly Father, we love you
[15:53] Lord.
[15:55] Father, you see the requests in the
[15:57] hearts of the people, those that have
[15:59] lifted their hands and they're just
[16:02] coming to service to look for you. I
[16:04] would ask, Lord, that you would grant
[16:06] their hearts desires. And Lord, that you
[16:09] would just be with our friends and
[16:11] family, Lord, that are all traveling and
[16:13] different meetings, different places.
[16:15] Lord, you see the ones that aren't here.
[16:17] God, I just pray that you'd be able to
[16:19] come individually to each need, Lord.
[16:21] You would just touch the hearts of the
[16:23] people. I'd ask that you just bless our
[16:26] speaker here this evening, Lord. That
[16:28] you just be with him, Lord, and you just
[16:30] use him, Lord. And I would just pray
[16:32] that everything that you would have for
[16:34] him bring his remembrance, Lord. And we
[16:36] just pray these things in Jesus' name.
[16:39] Amen.

[36:18] uh the kingdom of God. And so we just
[36:20] want to say God bless you to all those
[36:23] that are that are stepping up in this
[36:24] time. So uh Joshua chapter 15 we'll
[36:28] start at verse
[36:31] 16. And Caleb said, "He that smiteth
[36:34] Kirjth Sephur, and taketh it, to him
[36:37] will I give Exa, my daughter to wife."
[36:40] And Ael, the son of Kenaz, the brother
[36:42] of Caleb, took it, and he gave him Exa
[36:45] his daughter to wife. And it came to
[36:47] pass as she came unto him, that she
[36:50] moved him to ask of her father a field.
[36:53] And she lied off her ass, and Caleb said
[36:55] unto her, What is thou? Who answered,
[36:58] "Give me a blessing, for thou hast given
[37:00] me a southland. give me also springs of
[37:03] water. And he gave her the upper springs
[37:06] and the nether springs.
[37:08] Let's you all can have your seats
[37:16] and we're going to turn to Judges
[37:19] chapter one as well.
[37:33] Judges chapter
[37:35] 1
[37:37] and starting at verse
[37:42] 12. And Caleb said, "He that smiteth
[37:44] Kirth Sepher, and taketh it, to him will
[37:47] I give Axon my daughter to wife." And
[37:49] Ael the son of Ken as Caleb's younger
[37:52] brother, took it, and he gave him Axa
[37:54] his daughter to wife. And it came to
[37:56] pass when she came to him that she moved
[37:58] him to ask of her father a field. And
[38:00] she lied from off her ass. And Caleb
[38:02] said unto her, "What wilt thou?" And she
[38:05] said unto him, "Give me a blessing, for
[38:06] thou hast given me a southland, given me
[38:09] also springs of water." And Caleb gave
[38:12] her the upper springs and the nether
[38:15] springs. Lord Jesus, we come into your
[38:17] presence this evening, Lord. And Lord, I
[38:20] pray that you would just take control of
[38:22] the service, Lord, and these scriptures
[38:24] that we've read, Lord. And Lord, may you
[38:27] just take control of of my words and and
[38:30] what I would say, Lord. Take control of
[38:32] the the hearts and ears of the listener,
[38:34] Lord. And Lord, may you just receive all
[38:37] the the glory from everything that's
[38:39] said, Lord. I pray that you would let
[38:41] something be said that would speak to
[38:43] our hearts, Lord. That would just draw
[38:45] us closer to you, Lord. that would just
[38:47] help us to to be a little more like you
[38:50] when we leave here. Lord, we just thank
[38:52] you for your presence, Lord. And Lord,
[38:54] we lift before you all those that are
[38:55] traveling, Lord. Pray that you would
[38:57] continue to be with them as they're
[38:58] they're on the road, Lord, or those that
[39:00] have already gotten to Virginia,
[39:01] different ones, Lord. Be with all of
[39:03] them in the meetings and bring them back
[39:04] home safely once more. Lord, we love you
[39:07] and we thank you for all that you do for
[39:08] us. In the name of Lord Jesus Christ, we
[39:10] pray. Amen.
[39:14] 2 Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 says, "All
[39:18] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[39:20] and is profitable for doctrine, for
[39:22] reproof, for correction, for instruction
[39:26] in
[39:27] righteousness." Now, one thing that I
[39:30] have begun to notice in the scriptures
[39:33] is normally if something is said more
[39:36] than once, there has to be some
[39:38] importance to it.
[39:40] Um, I mean, obviously the scripture says
[39:43] everything in the Bible is given for
[39:46] doctrine, for approve, for correction,
[39:48] for instruction. But if God allows it to
[39:50] be said
[39:51] twice, he's trying to bring attention to
[39:54] something. This isn't something that,
[39:56] you know, like we said, anything that's
[39:58] in the scripture is good for
[40:01] instruction, even if it's only said
[40:03] once. But if God allows it to be in
[40:05] there more than once, then maybe it's
[40:07] something that we should look at a
[40:09] little bit. Maybe it's something that we
[40:10] should pay attention to. Now, there are
[40:13] lots of women in the Bible that get
[40:16] talked about. Um, there are lots of
[40:19] women in the Bible that stand out as
[40:22] special because of the role that they
[40:25] had or how God used them and brought
[40:28] them into the seedline of Christ or
[40:31] these different things that we go
[40:35] through. But yet, Axa here
[40:38] is definitely not a major character in
[40:41] the scriptures.
[40:44] Outside of these two portions that we
[40:45] just read, she is mentioned one other
[40:48] time a short passage in 1 Chronicles
[40:51] 2:49 that says, "And the daughter of
[40:54] Caleb was Axa." That's it. That's all
[40:57] that she's mentioned. It's mentioned
[40:59] she's Caleb's daughter. It's mentioned
[41:02] she was offered up as a prize for
[41:04] whoever would take this land. And then
[41:06] it and then in both places we see her
[41:09] coming to her father to make a
[41:15] [Music]
[41:16] request. Now in the kinsman redeemer in
[41:20] 1960, brother Brandham says, "Our
[41:23] heavenly father, I'm so glad today that
[41:25] there is a great high power knowing that
[41:28] God that we can approach through his son
[41:30] Christ Jesus and have an answer to what
[41:33] we ask. As in the past meeting, we were
[41:36] speak on how that men wandered about in
[41:38] sheepkin and goat skin and was
[41:40] destituted looking for a city whose
[41:42] builder and maker was God, knowing if
[41:45] they could ever once approach him, if
[41:46] they could find where he was. As Job of
[41:49] old said, if I could go knock on his
[41:51] door and otherwise if I could find where
[41:53] he is, he abides at, I would go home
[41:55] with him and would talk to him face to
[41:57] face. But there was no way for man to do
[42:00] that because he had sinned and had
[42:01] separated himself and become an alien to
[42:03] God. But through that precious one who
[42:06] came and opened up the way and forgave
[42:08] our sins and bring us before God not as
[42:11] aliens but as children coming to their
[42:13] father knowing that he will grant to us
[42:15] every request that we ask. Only one law
[42:18] is laid down that is if thou can't
[42:20] believe. That is the agreement. Satan
[42:22] claims that we will not believe and God
[42:24] says that we will believe. Now the
[42:26] battle is on and the decision is ours to
[42:28] make. Whichever way our decision is
[42:30] made, that's the way it will be. And
[42:32] it's so wonderfully written, all things
[42:33] are possible to them that believe. And
[42:36] we are believing today, coming
[42:37] approaching thee for divine favor,
[42:40] asking that you will regard our request.
[42:42] And every hand that went up, you know,
[42:43] beneath that hand in their heart what
[42:45] was meant. For it is written that thou
[42:47] dost know the intents and thoughts of
[42:49] the mind and can discern the mind. And
[42:51] we pray God that you'll answer according
[42:53] to your riches and your grace to every
[42:55] request that was
[42:58] mentioned. Now when you look up the
[43:01] definition for blessing, one of the
[43:03] definitions that you can pull out is
[43:05] God's favor and protection. Now Axa had
[43:08] been given to
[43:10] Offnail as a wife after Offnail had
[43:14] taken Kir suffer
[43:17] and she moved on her husband to ask of
[43:21] her father a field a land that they
[43:25] would have of their own
[43:27] and Ael asked that they were given the
[43:31] land but then Axa is looking at this and
[43:34] she
[43:35] realizes this land. It doesn't have
[43:39] water.
[43:41] It's a south land. It's a dry
[43:44] land. There's not necessarily a whole
[43:47] lot that we're going to be able to do
[43:48] with
[43:50] this. Now, I'm going to pull up a couple
[43:53] of volunts to come up here. I need
[43:56] brother Michael and Haven. If both of
[43:59] you will stand up and come up
[44:02] here and everybody's going, "What is
[44:05] happening? What is going on right now?
[44:08] Brother Michael, if you'll just stand
[44:09] right over
[44:11] here. Are we nervous yet,
[44:14] Haven? Just a
[44:18] little.
[44:19] So, brother Michael gets to stand in as
[44:22] Caleb for our little story here for a
[44:25] moment. And so Caleb
[44:28] has given his daughter to this man that
[44:31] was able to to take the city, this this
[44:34] mighty warrior. Andel, as you continue
[44:36] through the scriptures, he actually
[44:38] becomes the first judge of Israel. He
[44:41] rises up when Israel begins to fall away
[44:44] from believing God. When they become
[44:46] oppressed, nail is the one who rises up
[44:49] to push them back, to judge the land, to
[44:52] bring them back to God. Soel is a godly
[44:55] man. He's a godly soldier. So when he
[44:59] took this, Caleb gave his daughter to a
[45:02] good man. This wasn't just some random
[45:04] warrior that happened to stand up and be
[45:08] somehow impressive in the battle. This
[45:10] was a godly man and someone that he had
[45:13] seen raised up. It was his brother's
[45:16] son, which was normal at that time.
[45:20] But so his daughter's been married and
[45:24] now she comes to see her
[45:29] father. And so Haven gets to play this
[45:32] role. And so Ax is coming to her
[45:35] father and she arrives and she gets down
[45:39] off of the donkey that she's rising that
[45:41] she's riding. And the first thing that's
[45:45] recorded, you know, there's no chitchat
[45:48] of, "Oh, hey daughter. how are you
[45:49] doing? Hey, you know what's going on?
[45:52] This, that, or the other. The first
[45:54] thing that happens is Caleb looks out.
[45:57] He sees his daughter coming and he says,
[46:00] "What do you
[46:03] need?" The first thing, there's
[46:06] something about her. There's something
[46:08] about the glint in her eye. There's
[46:10] something about the expression in her
[46:12] face. He knows she's coming for a
[46:15] reason. This isn't just a visit.
[46:18] He's been through this before. His
[46:20] daughter has come to him with requests
[46:22] before. This isn't a strange
[46:28] situation. I can easily see Haven has
[46:33] asked her father for things a few times
[46:34] in her
[46:36] life. I don't think brother Michael is a
[46:38] stranger to Haven coming and saying,
[46:41] "Dad, can I get this?" or "Dad, can we
[46:44] do this?"
[46:46] or dad, can we buy this? Or whatever it
[46:50] might be. I'm sure even as they're
[46:52] standing there, both of them can think
[46:53] of a couple of times that this has
[46:55] happened through their
[46:57] lives. And here Caleb is, and his first
[47:00] thought when he sees his daughter, oh,
[47:03] she wants
[47:05] something, first thing he immediately
[47:08] looks at her and he says, what do you
[47:12] need?
[47:15] and she doesn't try to hemhaw around it.
[47:18] There's no, "Oh, I'm I'm I'm just coming
[47:20] to I'm bringing you coffee. I'm just I
[47:23] just kind of wanted to come hang out
[47:24] with my dad. I just wanted there's none
[47:26] of this. There's none going back and
[47:28] forth around." She's like, "Yes, I have
[47:30] come with a
[47:32] purpose." And she comes and she says,
[47:35] "You've given me a
[47:39] field." Actually, she starts off before
[47:41] she even goes into that. He says, "What
[47:44] do you need?" And she says, "Give me a
[47:48] blessing." And then she goes into the
[47:50] reason. You've given me a
[47:52] field. You've given us a
[47:55] field. Now, I need water for
[47:58] it. So, she's not coming. And she's not
[48:01] coming with a request. You didn't give
[48:03] me enough land. I need more land or I
[48:07] need houses or I need this, that, or the
[48:10] other. But if you pay attention, she
[48:12] comes with the
[48:14] request, you've given me
[48:17] land, but in order for this land to
[48:20] flourish. In order for it to be
[48:23] profitable, in order for me to tend it
[48:26] the way that I should, I need water for
[48:29] it. She's not coming saying, "You didn't
[48:32] give me a big enough tract of land."
[48:34] She's not saying, "I need servants."
[48:36] She's not saying, "I need money." She's
[48:39] coming with a very clear request of in
[48:41] order for what you've given me to
[48:44] succeed. In order for what you've given
[48:46] me to
[48:47] flourish, I also need
[48:52] this. And she comes
[48:55] boldly. Like I said, there are two
[48:57] parts. Dad immediately recognizes she
[49:00] wants
[49:02] something. And she doesn't try to beat
[49:04] around the bush. She goes, "This is what
[49:07] I have need of.
[49:09] give me a blessing. And she's saying in
[49:12] the most respectful way, and no way I
[49:13] might be stating this wrong, she's not
[49:15] coming across as disrespectful. She's
[49:16] not coming across as
[49:18] demanding. She's coming across in a
[49:20] respectful way because this is who she
[49:23] can go to. She didn't go to some random
[49:26] stranger. You guys can go sit down.
[49:28] Thank
[49:31] you. She doesn't go to some random
[49:33] stranger. She doesn't go to some just
[49:35] some random guy who owns the property
[49:37] next door and say, "Hey, I need your
[49:39] spring." She goes to her
[49:42] father to say, "In order for me to make
[49:47] use of what you've given us, in order
[49:50] for me to use the blessing you've
[49:52] already given
[49:54] me, I need this for it to flourish."
[50:00] And
[50:02] Caleb, his
[50:05] response is above and beyond. He doesn't
[50:08] just go, "Great, here's one spring." He
[50:10] goes, "Okay, here's two
[50:13] springs. We'll give you both the upper
[50:15] and the lower. You get both
[50:17] springs so that you have plenty of water
[50:19] for your land."
[50:24] Axa comes boldly to her
[50:27] father with a
[50:32] need,
[50:35] knowing that she'll get an
[50:37] answer. She doesn't come asking
[50:40] something her father can't provide. She
[50:42] doesn't come asking something her
[50:44] father's incapable providing. And she
[50:47] doesn't come asking
[50:49] something that there's no real reason
[50:51] for
[50:52] it. She's not coming just going, "I need
[50:56] more jewelry. There wasn't enough in my
[50:58] dowy. I need more. I need more fancy
[51:01] clothes. I need this." She's going,
[51:04] "We're going I'm going to work the land.
[51:07] We're going to prosper. But in order for
[51:09] that to happen, I need water for the
[51:12] land.
[51:16] I'm going to pick on brother Michael
[51:17] just a little bit
[51:20] longer. Brother
[51:22] Michael happens to be a business owner
[51:25] and brother Michael happens to employ
[51:28] brothers from the
[51:29] church. And so when when brother
[51:32] Michael's
[51:34] praying and asking for God's blessings,
[51:38] asking for more business, asking
[51:41] for people to accept the bids that he's
[51:43] put in or Lord, let me get this project
[51:46] or that project. He's not coming with
[51:48] request, Lord, I just want to make more
[51:50] money. Lord, I want to be rich, that the
[51:53] other. But he's coming saying, "Lord,
[51:56] you've given me these brothers in the
[51:58] church to help provide for. That's the
[52:02] role that you've blessed me
[52:03] with. But in order to do that, I have to
[52:07] have enough work to provide for my
[52:10] family and
[52:12] theirs." It's not making a selfish
[52:14] request. Lord, I just want as much
[52:16] business I can get so I can be rich and
[52:19] go on a vacation every month and drive
[52:21] the nicest cars and this that or the
[52:23] other. It's going, Lord, I need enough
[52:25] work to provide for my
[52:28] family and to provide for the people
[52:30] that you've entrusted me
[52:32] with. You've given them to me for a
[52:35] reason. You've employed them with me for
[52:38] a reason. Whether that's the brothers
[52:40] that he's working with that are in the
[52:42] church or whether that's the other
[52:43] employees he have that it's just he's
[52:46] getting to be a witness in front of or
[52:48] the brothers in the church are getting
[52:49] to be a witness in front of when they
[52:51] work side by
[52:55] side. But he asks for
[53:00] blessings but there's a real reason
[53:04] behind it.
[53:11] Matthew chapter
[53:13] 7 starting at verse 7 it says, "Ask and
[53:17] it shall be given to you. Seek and you
[53:19] shall find. Knock and it shall be opened
[53:21] unto you. For everyone that askketh
[53:23] receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth,
[53:26] and him that knockketh it shall be
[53:27] opened." Or what man is there of you,
[53:30] whom if his son ask bread, will he give
[53:32] him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will
[53:34] he give him a serpent? If ye then being
[53:36] evil, know how to give good gifts unto
[53:38] your children, how much more shall your
[53:41] father which is in heaven give good
[53:42] things to them that ask
[53:45] him. Throughout the scriptures, God
[53:48] tells us to come ask
[53:51] him to come to him and say, "Lord, give
[53:56] me a blessing."
[53:58] But at the same
[53:59] time, I think there's a lesson to be
[54:02] taken here from what we see with
[54:05] Axa. She's not just asking for a
[54:08] blessing
[54:10] for a blessing sake. She's not asking
[54:12] for a blessing simply to try
[54:15] to grow her own importance, grow her
[54:18] own, like I said, grow her own wealth,
[54:21] grow her own power.
[54:24] But she comes asking for the blessing in
[54:26] order to better care for what God has
[54:29] already given her, what her father has
[54:30] already given
[54:34] her. All too often, we can fall into the
[54:37] place where we're coming to God saying,
[54:38] "Lord, I really want
[54:40] this. Lord, I really want this blessing
[54:43] in my life, or I really want this
[54:45] blessing in my life."
[54:48] But we can get into the place where
[54:50] we're asking for a
[54:53] blessing for a blessing's sake. We're
[54:55] asking for a blessing simply because
[54:57] it's something we think we would enjoy
[54:58] or because it's something that we just
[55:01] want to
[55:03] have. We want the newest car. We want
[55:06] the newest electronic. We want the fill
[55:09] in the
[55:13] blank. But yet when we come and we come
[55:17] with a clear purpose and a clear reason
[55:19] going, "Lord, I'm asking for this to
[55:23] better take care of what you've already
[55:25] given
[55:26] me. Lord, you've entrusted me with
[55:29] this. I need this to take care of
[55:32] that." And it's not going,
[55:37] "Lord, I went out and I have a huge loan
[55:40] now so I can have the fanciest truck in
[55:42] the world. Lord, I need a better job so
[55:44] I can now pay for this
[55:46] truck. This isn't going to try to cover
[55:48] an unwise decision, but this is going,
[55:50] God has given you this or entrusted you
[55:52] with this, and now you're saying,
[55:55] Lord, I need this to take care of that.
[55:58] I need this to watch over
[56:03] that. I'm not trying to get a blessing
[56:06] simply to grow my own power, my own
[56:09] authority. But Lord, I'm looking for
[56:11] this blessing in order to continue to
[56:13] take care of what you've given me, of
[56:15] what you've entrusted me
[56:27] with. Genesis chapter
[56:30] 32 and verse
[56:34] 24. And Jacob was left alone, and there
[56:37] wrestled a man with him until the
[56:39] breaking of the day. And when he saw
[56:41] that he prevailed not against him, he
[56:42] touched the hollow of his thigh. And the
[56:44] hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint
[56:47] as he wrestled with him. And he said,
[56:49] "Let me go, for the day breakth." And he
[56:51] said, "I will not let thee go except
[56:54] thou bless
[56:56] me." Axa came to her father knowing that
[57:00] when she made the request, he would
[57:02] respond.
[57:03] She didn't come with a request thinking,
[57:06] "Oh, my father might turn his back and
[57:07] walk away and won't
[57:09] answer." She also came with the
[57:12] expectation that he would give her what
[57:14] she needed. He didn't come asking. She
[57:16] didn't come asking thinking, "Dad's
[57:19] probably going to say no, but I'm going
[57:20] to ask
[57:21] anyway." But she came asking with an
[57:25] expectation.
[57:27] Jacob, as he was wrestling with the
[57:29] angel, refused to release him until he
[57:32] received the blessing. He knew that he
[57:35] had need of something. He knew that he
[57:38] had need of a change in his life. He
[57:41] knew that he had need of
[57:43] something or otherwise he was going to
[57:45] be killed by his brother the next
[57:47] day. He needed something to change.
[57:52] He
[57:54] needed something because he knew that
[57:56] this was not just any man that he was
[57:58] wrestling with. He knew this was not
[58:00] just any person. And so he grabbed a
[58:03] hold
[58:05] until he got his blessing. He wasn't
[58:09] going to let him go until he had that
[58:12] blessing.
[58:14] In the sermon, as I thought on my ways,
[58:16] brother Brandham said, ' And as Jacob on
[58:18] his way with his wife and his children,
[58:21] he heard a message coming that Esau with
[58:23] a great army was coming to meet him, and
[58:25] he began to think on his ways the way
[58:27] he'd done Esau cheated him, and it drove
[58:30] him to prayer all night long. He
[58:32] wrestled with the angel of the Lord. I
[58:34] trust tonight that men and women, boys
[58:36] and girls, who has neglected the baptism
[58:38] of the Holy Ghost, you don't know how
[58:40] near you are to home. I trust that
[58:42] you'll purpose in your heart that you'll
[58:43] wrestle with the angel of the Lord and
[58:45] not let him go until you're
[58:47] blessed. And in the sermon unchange the
[58:49] unchangeable God in
[58:51] 1960, brother Random says, "And the main
[58:54] thing was that Jacob, he had dreams and
[58:56] visions and so forth, but this was one
[58:59] time he could lay his hand on something
[59:00] and say it's God, and he was able to
[59:03] hold on to it until the blessing came."
[59:06] Oh, if we could do that, if we could
[59:07] find a spot to where we could see God,
[59:09] whether it's in his word, wherever it
[59:12] is, and recognize it's God, and hold on
[59:14] to it until the blessing comes. Wrestle
[59:16] it out with God. God promised to do it.
[59:19] God said if we would seek, we would
[59:21] find. Ask and it shall be given. Knock
[59:23] and it'll be opened. Every word is true.
[59:25] When Jacob got a hold of something that
[59:27] he could look at, hold to with his
[59:30] hands. And seeing that it was God, he
[59:32] would not turn it loose.
[59:38] Let's turn to Esther Esther chapter
[59:45] 5. Esther chapter 5 and starting at
[59:48] verse
[59:54] one. Now it came to pass on the third
[59:56] day that Esther put on her royal apparel
[59:59] and stood in the inner court of the
[1:00:01] king's house over against the king's
[1:00:03] house. And the king sat upon his royal
[1:00:05] throne in the royal house over against
[1:00:07] the gate of the house. And it was so
[1:00:09] when the king saw Esther, the queen
[1:00:11] standing in the court, that she obtained
[1:00:13] favor in his sight. And the king held
[1:00:15] out to Esther the golden scepter that
[1:00:17] was in his hand. So Esther drew near and
[1:00:19] touched the top of the scepter. Then
[1:00:22] said the king unto her, "What wilt thou,
[1:00:23] Queen Esther? And what is thy request?
[1:00:26] It shall be even given thee to the half
[1:00:30] of the kingdom.
[1:00:36] Esther had gone
[1:00:39] through a time of prayer, a time of
[1:00:42] fasting to prepare for this because she
[1:00:46] knew that according to the law, if the
[1:00:47] king didn't extend the scepter, then she
[1:00:50] would die. But yet at the same time, she
[1:00:53] came with
[1:00:54] boldness with her request.
[1:00:59] And the king knew that she was coming
[1:01:02] for a
[1:01:04] reason. She He knew the law, too. People
[1:01:07] didn't come into his presence uninvited
[1:01:10] for no
[1:01:13] reason. If they were willing to risk
[1:01:15] dying, it better be important.
[1:01:20] And so the king knew for her to come
[1:01:22] into his presence that way that she
[1:01:25] wanted
[1:01:26] something that she had a request on her
[1:01:29] heart that she was seeking a
[1:01:33] blessing. And so he extends the scepter.
[1:01:36] And then he asks, "What do you need?
[1:01:39] What wilt
[1:01:40] thou? I'll give anything to you up to
[1:01:43] half my
[1:01:45] kingdom." Don't ask small. Ask boldly.
[1:01:49] Ask whatever you have need
[1:01:55] of. We come into the presence
[1:01:59] and we don't have to come
[1:02:04] in when we come to the Lord concerned
[1:02:07] like Esther that maybe God's going to
[1:02:09] put us to death for coming into his
[1:02:10] presence.
[1:02:12] Esther had to push past the fear to go
[1:02:17] in. She had to go in with prayer and
[1:02:21] fasting because she was afraid that she
[1:02:22] would
[1:02:25] die. We as the bride of
[1:02:30] Christ have a husband that wants us to
[1:02:33] come into his
[1:02:35] presence. He invites us into his
[1:02:38] presence. He wants to spend time with
[1:02:40] us. He wants to spend time conversing.
[1:02:43] He wants to spend
[1:02:45] time letting us get to know
[1:02:50] him. But all too often we
[1:02:53] take that privilege a little too
[1:02:59] lightly. It becomes something
[1:03:03] where, as some would say, we almost
[1:03:05] start to treat God as a vending machine.
[1:03:08] We only come to him to push the buttons
[1:03:11] to get our requests answered. Uh Lord, I
[1:03:14] need to order that item. I really want a
[1:03:16] Pepsi today. I want a Seven Up today. I
[1:03:19] want
[1:03:20] a Snicker bar
[1:03:23] today. This, that, and the other. Lays
[1:03:26] potato
[1:03:27] chips. Whatever it might
[1:03:31] be. But yet as we go through these case
[1:03:34] in the
[1:03:37] Bible, whenever someone comes in for a
[1:03:41] blessing and for a
[1:03:44] request, they're not coming in to this
[1:03:49] lightly. Axa came to her father
[1:03:51] expecting an answer and expecting to
[1:03:55] receive, but she came
[1:03:59] in still being respectful.
[1:04:02] still making sure, hey, this is my
[1:04:04] father. I'm going to treat him the right
[1:04:08] way, and I'm going to give
[1:04:11] him a reason for what I'm
[1:04:15] asking. Jacob, as he's wrestling, goes,
[1:04:18] I have need of this
[1:04:20] blessing. I will not let go. I will keep
[1:04:24] fighting until I'm able to get it.
[1:04:27] Esther goes through the fear, goes
[1:04:30] through the threat of
[1:04:34] death because she has an urgent
[1:04:39] request. And the king, her husband goes,
[1:04:42] "Just tell me what you
[1:04:44] need. Up to half my kingdom, I'll give
[1:04:47] it to you."
[1:04:52] We serve a God
[1:04:53] that wants to give us the
[1:04:57] blessings. He wants to take care of us.
[1:05:04] But he still wants us to approach him,
[1:05:08] to approach him with boldness, to
[1:05:09] approach him with honor, to approach him
[1:05:11] with
[1:05:14] respect, to approach
[1:05:17] him with requests that are after his
[1:05:22] heart. We're not coming in asking simply
[1:05:26] because this is what I
[1:05:28] want. But if we're the bride of Christ
[1:05:31] and we're living out a
[1:05:33] life, living out the life of Christ
[1:05:36] within us, then we're bringing a request
[1:05:38] to God that's exactly what he wants us
[1:05:40] to
[1:05:41] ask. Cuz I'm coming with his desires
[1:05:44] already in my
[1:05:45] heart. I'm coming wanting the same thing
[1:05:48] that he wants to give me.
[1:05:52] This isn't us sitting here going, "Hey,
[1:05:56] we're the bride and so all of us should
[1:05:59] now be millionaires because we have this
[1:06:02] wonderful prosperity gospel where we get
[1:06:03] everything that we want."
[1:06:09] But this is
[1:06:12] going, I'm coming
[1:06:14] to my heavenly
[1:06:16] father because I know that he'll give me
[1:06:19] the good gifts that he'll give me the
[1:06:21] things I truly
[1:06:22] need and he won't give me the things
[1:06:25] that I don't
[1:06:29] need. And we can I can go to my heavenly
[1:06:31] father and I can make the request and
[1:06:33] he's never going to tell me no because
[1:06:35] he can't afford it.
[1:06:38] I expect there are plenty of times that
[1:06:40] any father or mother here has had to
[1:06:43] tell their child no for
[1:06:45] something. Not because we wouldn't have
[1:06:48] wanted to give it to them, but because
[1:06:50] at that moment we didn't have the funds.
[1:06:55] We didn't have the finances. Now, there
[1:06:58] are plenty of times we tell our kids no
[1:06:59] because they don't need it. We know they
[1:07:02] don't need it. Whether they understand
[1:07:04] that or not, we know it's not something
[1:07:06] that they should
[1:07:08] have. But there are plenty of other
[1:07:10] times where they ask for
[1:07:13] something and in your heart you're
[1:07:15] going, "Oh, I wish I
[1:07:17] could. I wish I could give that to you.
[1:07:20] I wish I could afford that right now."
[1:07:23] And depending on the age of the child,
[1:07:25] you might not be able to
[1:07:27] explain. We just we've got to wait for
[1:07:30] next payday. We've got to wait for
[1:07:32] whatever. I can't afford that right
[1:07:36] now. We never get told no by our
[1:07:39] heavenly father for that
[1:07:41] reason. We're never getting told no on a
[1:07:46] blessing because God doesn't have enough
[1:07:49] in the bank for him to write the
[1:07:52] check. He doesn't have enough to
[1:07:56] provide. God never says no for that
[1:07:58] reason.
[1:08:03] But God knows what we truly
[1:08:05] need. God knows what we need in order
[1:08:08] for us to continue to grow, to continue
[1:08:10] to
[1:08:14] mature. And so, he'll tell us no for the
[1:08:17] things that he knows are going to do
[1:08:19] more harm than
[1:08:20] good. He'll tell us no for the blessings
[1:08:23] we request. That that's not really what
[1:08:26] my heart is. That's not really
[1:08:28] what you need to have.
[1:08:31] [Music]
[1:08:33] In the sermon, the church choosing law
[1:08:35] for grace. Brother
[1:08:36] Brandham praying says, "Our heavenly
[1:08:39] father, we are approaching thy throne of
[1:08:40] grace, not thy throne of justice. Lord,
[1:08:43] we could not stand it. We do not ask for
[1:08:45] justice. We'd be lost, but we ask for
[1:08:47] grace, and we come because thou bid us
[1:08:50] to come. And we have the promise that we
[1:08:52] will receive what we ask for if we'll
[1:08:53] come boldly, not doubting, and ask it in
[1:08:56] the name of the Lord Jesus. For it is
[1:08:58] written, "Whatever you do in word or
[1:09:00] deed, do it all in the name of Jesus."
[1:09:02] He said himself while on earth, "If you
[1:09:04] if you ask the father anything in my
[1:09:06] name, I'll do
[1:09:08] it." And we are sure that we get what we
[1:09:11] ask for. For we come in faith believing
[1:09:13] with all that's in our heart to believe
[1:09:16] with it in Jesus name for grace and
[1:09:19] mercy and courage to surround us
[1:09:21] tonight. And give us a great portion of
[1:09:23] thy spirit in our hearts as we need it.
[1:09:26] Give faith to those who raised their
[1:09:27] hands and I am one of them for the
[1:09:29] request that was in our hearts that we
[1:09:30] will believe with all our hearts that
[1:09:32] you will grant our requests for we
[1:09:34] commit the service and ourselves to you
[1:09:36] to do with us as you see fit as we
[1:09:38] approach the word to preach it. Let the
[1:09:40] Holy Spirit come and anoint the words
[1:09:42] and plant them in the heart of us all
[1:09:44] for we ask it in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:09:49] Hebrews chapter 4:16 says, "Let us
[1:09:51] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[1:09:53] grace that we may obtain mercy and find
[1:09:56] grace to help in time of
[1:09:59] need." Philippians 4 6-7 says, "Be
[1:10:02] careful for nothing, but in everything
[1:10:05] by prayer and supplication with
[1:10:06] thanksgiving, let your requests be made
[1:10:08] known unto God, and the peace of God
[1:10:11] which passeth all understanding shall
[1:10:13] keep your hearts and minds through
[1:10:14] Christ Jesus.
[1:10:18] Give me a
[1:10:23] blessing. Scriptures say that if we
[1:10:27] as humans can give our children good
[1:10:31] gifts, how much more will the heavenly
[1:10:33] father give us a good gift? Once again,
[1:10:36] he's looking at it through the eyes of
[1:10:38] the father going, "Yes, this is
[1:10:40] something that will benefit them, that
[1:10:42] will help them grow, that will help them
[1:10:44] mature." or he's looking at something
[1:10:46] going, "No, that's going to make them
[1:10:48] spoiled brats. They don't need that.
[1:10:51] This is going to make them
[1:10:53] too reliant on this or too reliant on
[1:10:57] that instead of trusting me the way that
[1:10:59] I they
[1:11:02] should." We can go through time and time
[1:11:06] again with the
[1:11:07] scriptures telling us and reminding us
[1:11:11] to come to God with boldness with our
[1:11:13] requests.
[1:11:16] to come to him as the loving father. To
[1:11:19] come to
[1:11:22] him and expect an
[1:11:28] answer. And then we
[1:11:32] as the children, as we as the
[1:11:38] bride need to have that expectation that
[1:11:41] we'll receive an
[1:11:42] answer and also be willing to accept
[1:11:46] when God tells us no. For some
[1:11:48] reason, when he looks at it
[1:11:52] and he tells us no, we have to step back
[1:11:54] and go, "All right, Lord. Obviously, I
[1:11:56] was looking at this wrong somehow.
[1:12:00] Even if I was coming in with what I
[1:12:03] thought was a a pure heart on it, that I
[1:12:06] thought I was coming in with the right
[1:12:08] reason. I thought I was asking for
[1:12:09] something to help care for these other
[1:12:11] blessings. I thought I was asking with
[1:12:13] the right purpose behind
[1:12:17] it. Lord, help me to see through your
[1:12:20] eyes. Help me to see it the same way
[1:12:22] that you do.
[1:12:24] help me to have the same heart that you
[1:12:26] do so that I can accept and and move
[1:12:31] forward with the answer that you're
[1:12:32] giving
[1:12:34] me. But also, we can't fall into the
[1:12:37] trap
[1:12:38] of going, "All right, well,
[1:12:42] Lord, those are the small
[1:12:46] things. They're not worth asking about.
[1:12:48] They're not worth bothering you
[1:12:50] about. Or maybe I don't want to ask for
[1:12:53] this because I'm afraid God will say
[1:12:55] no. So I'd rather just
[1:13:02] not. God wants us to come. God wants
[1:13:06] us to be
[1:13:09] asking. God wants us to be bringing our
[1:13:12] requests to him.
[1:13:17] And God will use those
[1:13:19] requests to test us. God will use those
[1:13:23] requests to test our
[1:13:25] hearts to see, are we really asking for
[1:13:28] for good
[1:13:30] reasons? The example I talked about with
[1:13:33] brother Michael earlier. If brother
[1:13:35] Michael spending all his time praying,
[1:13:36] Lord, I just want my business to grow. I
[1:13:38] just want it to get more successful. I
[1:13:40] just want to be able to make more
[1:13:42] money. And he's never thinking about
[1:13:45] what's been entrusted to him. He's never
[1:13:46] been thinking about how do I care for
[1:13:49] those under me. It's just
[1:13:51] about do the numbers at the end look
[1:13:54] bigger and
[1:13:59] better. And I'm not picking on brother
[1:14:01] Michael because I know anything about
[1:14:02] his prayer life. He just happens to be a
[1:14:04] good illustration right
[1:14:06] now. But if it's all
[1:14:08] about I want a bigger company, I want to
[1:14:11] be more successful. I want to be I want
[1:14:14] I I I
[1:14:17] I God's probably not going to send a
[1:14:20] whole
[1:14:21] lot that
[1:14:28] direction. God's wanting us to come in
[1:14:31] with the same desires that he has, with
[1:14:34] the same wants that he
[1:14:36] has. We're coming in with the request
[1:14:42] Hey, right now I'm going through the
[1:14:44] season. I'm going, Lord, you've
[1:14:46] entrusted me with a wife and five
[1:14:51] children. Lord, I
[1:14:53] need to be able to provide for
[1:14:57] them. Lord, I'm not asking for a job to
[1:15:00] make a million dollars a
[1:15:02] year. I'm asking for enough to provide
[1:15:06] because that's what you've given me.
[1:15:08] That's what you've entrusted me.
[1:15:13] I'm asking for the well, the spring of
[1:15:16] water to be able to water the lands that
[1:15:18] you've given
[1:15:20] me. And each one of us have those types
[1:15:23] of things in our lives where we look at
[1:15:25] and go, Lord, this is what you've given
[1:15:26] me. This is what you've entrusted me
[1:15:28] with. You've entrusted me with this
[1:15:31] responsibility or this gift in my life
[1:15:33] or this talent or this
[1:15:37] ability. Lord, how do I water that? How
[1:15:39] do I use
[1:15:42] that, Lord? If you've given me a gift of
[1:15:46] music in some
[1:15:47] sort, how do
[1:15:50] I develop this for you? Lord, I
[1:15:54] don't If you've got a voice to sing,
[1:15:58] Lord, how do I how do I develop this for
[1:16:00] your glory? Lord, I don't want to go off
[1:16:02] to Nashville and become some big music
[1:16:05] star, but Lord, I do want to give you my
[1:16:09] best. And if you've given me a talent or
[1:16:12] an ability to sing, how do I make that
[1:16:14] better for you?
[1:16:18] If you've given
[1:16:20] me the ability to
[1:16:22] pray,
[1:16:24] if you've given me the talent to be a
[1:16:28] prayer warrior, Lord, how do I dive
[1:16:31] deeper into that? How do I surrender it
[1:16:34] more to you? How do I develop it
[1:16:40] more? Lord, if you've given me an
[1:16:43] ability to make
[1:16:46] money, I've known some people like that
[1:16:48] that it seemed like, the way my mom
[1:16:51] would describe it, seemed like they had
[1:16:52] the mightest touch. Every business they
[1:16:54] touched
[1:16:59] flourished. Well, that's the ability
[1:17:01] you've been given. Wonderful.
[1:17:05] How do you allow God to use
[1:17:10] that? I know there are those around the
[1:17:13] world that God has given that ability to
[1:17:15] make money who then turn around and give
[1:17:19] so much to ministries or give so much to
[1:17:22] missionaries or do those things because
[1:17:25] they're not trying to hoard up huge bank
[1:17:28] accounts.
[1:17:29] They're not trying to make themselves be
[1:17:32] so
[1:17:36] comfortable. The Lord didn't give me
[1:17:38] that gift.
[1:17:44] But whatever gift it is that God's given
[1:17:46] you, if he's given you a gift
[1:17:50] of being able to connect with people,
[1:17:54] being able to build relationships, being
[1:17:57] able to be diligent in your
[1:18:01] work, to be attentive to the details, to
[1:18:06] be there's so many different things that
[1:18:09] God can put in your life and go this is
[1:18:12] what makes you
[1:18:14] special and sometimes the world will
[1:18:17] look at it and go that's not really a
[1:18:21] talent but yet that's got how God wired
[1:18:23] you that's how God made you and that's
[1:18:25] what God put in
[1:18:28] you and we need to be willing to come
[1:18:31] like Axa going Lord you've entrusted
[1:18:33] this to me because this is how you made
[1:18:35] me you've given me this gift or you've
[1:18:38] given me this ability Lord
[1:18:42] Maybe I don't even know what the spring
[1:18:44] is that I need to water my
[1:18:47] field. But Lord, you
[1:18:49] do. And Lord, right now I'm coming to
[1:18:52] you and I'm asking for that nameless
[1:18:53] spring because
[1:18:55] I maybe I don't
[1:18:57] know. Maybe it's there's some sort of
[1:19:00] class somewhere. Maybe it's I just need
[1:19:02] to spend time with another brother or
[1:19:05] sister that they have the gift of being
[1:19:08] able to pour into someone
[1:19:11] else. Maybe it's I'm waiting for the
[1:19:14] Lord to lead me to that spring.
[1:19:21] We have these fields that God has
[1:19:23] already given us, already entrusted in
[1:19:25] our
[1:19:27] lives and we can boldly come and say
[1:19:30] Lord I need something to help this field
[1:19:37] flourish. And I'm not coming asking Lord
[1:19:40] I want you to raise me up on high and I
[1:19:42] want my name in lights and I want
[1:19:44] everyone to know me
[1:19:47] and but it's Lord you've entrusted this
[1:19:51] to me already. You've given this to me
[1:19:53] for a
[1:19:55] reason and we just so left the physical
[1:19:58] side of the world for a little
[1:20:01] bit. Lord, you've given me this talent
[1:20:04] in my
[1:20:05] life. You've given me this gift. You've
[1:20:08] given me this
[1:20:12] calling. And Lord, I don't
[1:20:15] know how to develop
[1:20:18] it. I think there are plenty of times in
[1:20:20] our lives where we sit there and we go,
[1:20:22] Lord, I don't know how to do anything
[1:20:24] with this. You've put this in me for
[1:20:26] some reason, and I don't know what to do
[1:20:29] with it now.
[1:20:33] And this is the moment when we can come
[1:20:35] to the Lord and go, "Hey, Lord,
[1:20:38] Father, I need some springs for this
[1:20:40] field. I don't know what the name of the
[1:20:42] spring is. I don't know where the
[1:20:44] spring's
[1:20:46] located. All I know is I need some
[1:20:49] water. I need some water so this field
[1:20:52] can grow. I need some water so this
[1:20:55] field can prosper. this field that
[1:20:57] you've already given
[1:21:02] me. You know, I look
[1:21:04] at some of the different teenagers that
[1:21:08] are coming
[1:21:09] up and they're moving into the point of
[1:21:13] life where they're looking for careers
[1:21:16] or they're looking for a future spouse
[1:21:21] or they're trying to figure out where
[1:21:23] God's leading
[1:21:24] them. You know, I'm at the point where
[1:21:26] I'm having fun watching my oldest start
[1:21:29] to go through those kind of questions
[1:21:31] and try to figure
[1:21:33] out what is it that God has designed him
[1:21:36] for? What what's the purpose God has in
[1:21:39] his
[1:21:41] life? Where is it that he's being called
[1:21:43] to
[1:21:46] go? You know, I look at Connor over
[1:21:48] there as he's trying to figure out,
[1:21:51] okay, what's the career in my life?
[1:21:52] Where what direction am I supposed to
[1:21:54] go? What am I supposed to
[1:21:59] do? Dylan and Jonah, as they're figuring
[1:22:02] things
[1:22:06] out, sure, they're working electrical
[1:22:09] right
[1:22:10] now. Is that what God has for them for
[1:22:12] their whole life?
[1:22:15] Maybe. Brother Michael says,
[1:22:20] "Yes, it might be. They might be
[1:22:23] supposed to be electricians for the rest
[1:22:24] of their life. Or it might be that
[1:22:28] they're electricians for a
[1:22:30] season and God has something that he's
[1:22:33] moving them
[1:22:36] towards. Austin just got
[1:22:41] married. He's doing the same thing. He's
[1:22:43] got electrical going right
[1:22:46] now. And more than likely, if you were
[1:22:48] to ask him, he's like, "This is how I'm
[1:22:49] going to provide for my family.
[1:22:53] this is it and that might
[1:22:56] be. But it also might be for a
[1:23:03] season. But each one of these as they're
[1:23:06] going through these periods and going
[1:23:08] through these times
[1:23:13] and in a
[1:23:15] world where so many
[1:23:19] people get so wrapped up and so
[1:23:22] worried about trying to
[1:23:26] find their dream
[1:23:28] job, trying to find their dream whatever
[1:23:33] that they're going
[1:23:38] for we as children of God are sitting
[1:23:41] there going, "Okay,
[1:23:42] Lord, you've entrusted us this
[1:23:45] field. This is what I'm supposed to care
[1:23:50] for. And Lord, I need a
[1:23:54] spring. I need a spring so that I can
[1:23:57] let this field grow, let this field
[1:23:59] prosper.
[1:24:03] that may not ever lead
[1:24:05] me to wealth and fame or anything like
[1:24:11] that, but if it can lead
[1:24:14] me to the satisfaction of knowing that
[1:24:17] God is using me and God is using the
[1:24:20] gifts that he's placed in my
[1:24:23] life and that I'm using them for him in
[1:24:26] whatever position he's put me in,
[1:24:32] A week or so ago, I was talking with
[1:24:34] brother Ken about all the different jobs
[1:24:36] that he's been through and the different
[1:24:38] career changes that he had to go
[1:24:40] through.
[1:24:43] And just in talking to him and listening
[1:24:46] to him as I was able to pick up, he has
[1:24:49] some skill and some talent for
[1:24:52] organization, for understanding the way
[1:24:54] the processes move forward. He worked in
[1:24:57] parts
[1:24:58] and worked in factories and worked
[1:25:01] different things. And so he has a mind
[1:25:03] that lines up things in an orderly
[1:25:06] manner that keeps things structured and
[1:25:08] keep things
[1:25:10] organized. And each time
[1:25:13] that he would lose a
[1:25:18] job, and it's easy to point all this out
[1:25:20] now because it's way past when it
[1:25:22] happened. We're looking, you know,
[1:25:23] hindsight's 2020. He can look at it. And
[1:25:25] it's great to listen to his testimony.
[1:25:27] He goes,
[1:25:28] "Yeah, they were firing all these
[1:25:31] people. They were up. They had one more
[1:25:33] person they needed to fire and it ended
[1:25:35] up being me. You know, I was in this I
[1:25:38] was at this job. I'd been doing good
[1:25:39] however long. And then they had to let
[1:25:41] some people go. Well, the boss's brother
[1:25:45] or the boss's son or whatever, he got to
[1:25:47] keep the job. I got laid off."
[1:25:49] But each time that would
[1:25:51] happen, he would get led
[1:25:54] into another job that allowed him to use
[1:25:58] those skills and
[1:26:00] talents and he would be able to move up.
[1:26:04] He would be able to show and exercise
[1:26:08] what God had placed in
[1:26:10] him and he would be able to succeed.
[1:26:15] Now, in no way did it mean that brother
[1:26:17] Ken became rich and
[1:26:21] famous. Boy, such a woman was quick to
[1:26:23] shake her head on that
[1:26:28] one. But he was able to provide for his
[1:26:33] family and the Lord kept opening up the
[1:26:37] doors that he
[1:26:41] needed. I'm on the flip side of it.
[1:26:46] where I'm sitting there waiting for the
[1:26:47] Lord to open the next door for me. But
[1:26:49] yet, I can look at Brother Ken's
[1:26:51] testimony and go, "Okay, the Lord has
[1:26:53] shown himself faithful.
[1:26:57] The Lord was willing to answer the
[1:27:00] request and give him the blessings that
[1:27:01] he
[1:27:02] needed to be able to keep taking care of
[1:27:05] the family, to be able to keep
[1:27:07] providing, to open up that next
[1:27:10] opportunity, and to open up
[1:27:12] opportunities that allowed him to keep
[1:27:14] using those talents that he had in his
[1:27:17] life. He wasn't having huge changes
[1:27:21] where he went from, I succeeded in this
[1:27:23] business and then I went over and I did
[1:27:25] this instead.
[1:27:29] But God kept him where the skills and
[1:27:32] abilities that he
[1:27:33] had could continue to be expressed,
[1:27:37] could continue to be practiced, could
[1:27:39] continue to be
[1:27:43] used. And for our young people as
[1:27:45] they're coming up
[1:27:47] and they have all these questions about
[1:27:51] life and they have all these questions
[1:27:55] about what am I supposed to be
[1:27:58] doing? What is
[1:28:01] God calling me to do? And a lot of times
[1:28:05] I know we can all
[1:28:07] remember or probably most of us at least
[1:28:09] can remember being that age going Lord I
[1:28:12] don't have any talents. I'm not good at
[1:28:14] anything. I don't know what you're doing
[1:28:16] for with me. I don't know what I'm
[1:28:18] supposed to
[1:28:22] do. And maybe they're at the stage where
[1:28:25] they can't even identify the field
[1:28:27] they've been given yet. Maybe they don't
[1:28:30] know what
[1:28:32] that first blessing is that's in their
[1:28:38] life. But yet still, we can take
[1:28:43] what God has given
[1:28:45] us. And we can boldly come before the
[1:28:48] throne and go, "Lord, I want to better
[1:28:51] care for
[1:28:54] this. Lord, I want this to be able to
[1:28:57] grow. I want this to be able to bloom. I
[1:29:00] want this to be able to
[1:29:03] flourish." For husbands, we have our
[1:29:05] wives that we've been entrusted with.
[1:29:07] And part of our role is to
[1:29:12] provide and to care
[1:29:14] for and to help her bloom and
[1:29:18] flourish where she's
[1:29:20] at. Our wives don't have careers where
[1:29:23] they're going out and they're building a
[1:29:25] big name in the business community. A
[1:29:28] lot of times they're unrecognized to the
[1:29:30] world as they're sitting at home dealing
[1:29:32] with the stress of schooling the kids
[1:29:34] and cleaning the house and cooking the
[1:29:36] food.
[1:29:38] And why do the kids fight every
[1:29:42] moment? Why did something get broken
[1:29:45] again? Why did this happen? Why did that
[1:29:47] happen?
[1:29:51] And yet we're supposed to be coming
[1:29:52] behind and
[1:29:54] going. Let me help you flourish where
[1:29:57] you're at. Let me help you find those
[1:30:00] springs so that you can bring out the
[1:30:02] talents that are within you. So that you
[1:30:04] can bring out the abilities that God has
[1:30:07] put inside
[1:30:11] you. Because God's made you for a
[1:30:13] purpose as well. God's made each one of
[1:30:15] us for a purpose and given each one of
[1:30:16] us special talents for a
[1:30:21] reason. God doesn't make junk. God
[1:30:24] doesn't
[1:30:27] make something for no reason. God
[1:30:30] doesn't make something for no
[1:30:35] purpose. And we come before God and we
[1:30:38] go, "God, I need a blessing.
[1:30:42] I need a blessing in order to keep
[1:30:44] growing. I need a blessing in
[1:30:48] order to make use of what you've already
[1:30:50] given
[1:30:53] me. We don't come asking to be rich or
[1:30:56] famous. We don't come asking to be so
[1:30:59] wealthy. We don't come asking to be
[1:31:01] recognized around town and everybody
[1:31:04] knows my name and this that or the
[1:31:05] other.
[1:31:08] But we come seeking the
[1:31:13] blessing to take care of what God's
[1:31:15] already given us.
[1:31:18] [Music]
[1:31:20] We come boldly before the throne
[1:31:24] knowing that our husband will answer,
[1:31:26] knowing that our father will answer.
[1:31:28] Knowing that he will provide what we
[1:31:32] need, knowing that he
[1:31:35] will
[1:31:38] provide, even when we look at it and go,
[1:31:40] Lord, I don't know how you're going to
[1:31:41] do
[1:31:42] this. I don't know how you're going to
[1:31:44] provide in this situation.
[1:31:48] But Lord, I still know that you're
[1:31:50] able. I still know that you never tell
[1:31:53] me no because you don't have enough
[1:31:54] money in the
[1:31:57] account. You always will
[1:32:01] provide. It may not be quite like I
[1:32:04] expected. May not be quite like I
[1:32:08] wanted, but you will still provide what
[1:32:11] I need. You will still give me the
[1:32:12] blessing that I need in my life.
[1:32:18] As the musicians
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:32] come, this is a little bit of a lengthy
[1:32:37] quote, but my
[1:32:39] father-in-law sent this to me the other
[1:32:42] day, and this kind of got me started
[1:32:44] looking in the direction I went
[1:32:47] tonight. It's in the sermon, Be Certain
[1:32:50] of
[1:32:51] God, January 25th,
[1:32:55] 1959. Brother Brandham says, "Have you
[1:32:58] in need
[1:32:59] today? Have you in need greater than
[1:33:01] you're physically able to
[1:33:03] obtain? Is the money so low that you
[1:33:05] can't pay your rent? Is the children
[1:33:08] wanting new shoes and you ain't got the
[1:33:10] money to buy them? Is the barrel empty
[1:33:12] at your house and the crew is about to
[1:33:14] run
[1:33:15] dry? You can't buy feed for your stock
[1:33:18] and there's something wrong. Remember,
[1:33:20] he made a
[1:33:22] promise. Are you sick and the doctor
[1:33:24] says that you need an operation? You
[1:33:26] haven't got the money to do it. You have
[1:33:29] a
[1:33:30] need. Are you a sinner? Is your need
[1:33:33] great knowing if God should call today,
[1:33:35] you'd be lost?
[1:33:37] Are you a backslider running from God
[1:33:39] and you know you belong to some church,
[1:33:41] but you know you're not right? Your own
[1:33:43] conscience tells you according to the
[1:33:45] word that you're not right and you have
[1:33:47] a need. Don't let these words fall on
[1:33:50] thorny grounds or on rocks, stony
[1:33:52] hearts. May they fall in good, fertile
[1:33:54] soil.
[1:33:57] If you're sick and the doctor says you
[1:34:00] can't get well and you promise God that
[1:34:02] you'll serve him all the days of your
[1:34:04] life and you're certain that he is God,
[1:34:05] come meet his requirement. If you have a
[1:34:08] need, if you have a need, will you first
[1:34:10] do as much as to raise your hand to God
[1:34:13] that you have a need of something? God
[1:34:15] bless you. Let us pray. Oh Lord, just as
[1:34:19] certain as I'm in this pulpit this
[1:34:21] morning, I know that there could not be
[1:34:23] one of those hands go up without you
[1:34:25] knowing it. for thou art God. You said,
[1:34:28] "Is not so many sparrows sold for two
[1:34:30] farings? How much more are you than a
[1:34:33] sparrow?" How much more did you see the
[1:34:35] hands of those mortal beings in which
[1:34:37] your son Jesus died for? How much more
[1:34:40] did you see their hands than you would a
[1:34:43] sparrow if it fell this morning? I
[1:34:45] suppose for a dozen sparrows wouldn't
[1:34:47] sell for a penny this morning because no
[1:34:49] one wants
[1:34:51] them. There'd be the trouble of burying
[1:34:53] them, but you know every one of them.
[1:34:55] You know every feather that's in their
[1:34:56] body. You know every hair that's on our
[1:34:59] head. Oh Lord, answer prayer. Let them
[1:35:02] be certain this morning that you are God
[1:35:03] and it's your spirit. May the dullness
[1:35:06] and glamour of this modern-day religion
[1:35:08] drop away from them saying, "Oh, I
[1:35:10] belong to certain such church. God, may
[1:35:13] that fade from their mind right now in
[1:35:15] this one moment. May they catch a
[1:35:17] glimpse of eternal life." And then
[1:35:19] they'll seek and hunger for it to know
[1:35:20] what God is. And they're certain that he
[1:35:23] is. He keeps his
[1:35:25] word. To the sinner, may they repent
[1:35:27] quickly. Make ready for baptism in the
[1:35:30] name of Jesus Christ. And you promised
[1:35:32] you'd give them the Holy Ghost. You said
[1:35:34] it, Lord. You keep your
[1:35:36] promise. There's a backslider that's
[1:35:39] certain you are God, and they've
[1:35:40] wandered away. May they come today
[1:35:42] because you said, "Though your sins be
[1:35:44] as scarlet, they shall be white as snow.
[1:35:46] Red like crimson, they'll be white like
[1:35:48] wool."
[1:35:50] And if there's those who are sick, may
[1:35:52] they realize that you're God. You keep
[1:35:54] your word. You must keep your word. As
[1:35:56] they lay themselves with their oil, the
[1:35:59] spirit that's in them that's confessing
[1:36:00] they believe. And then also with the
[1:36:02] word, the bread of life that's went
[1:36:04] forth, Christ ground up in them in the
[1:36:06] Old Testament, in the New Testament to
[1:36:08] show that he's the same yesterday,
[1:36:10] today, and forever. May they mix that
[1:36:12] word with the oil spirit that they've
[1:36:14] got. Then stand to their feet at the
[1:36:16] altar saying, "This is all I got, Lord.
[1:36:18] I bring it. Oh, how you'll multiply it.
[1:36:22] How it'll call the God of history on the
[1:36:24] scene. How it'll make Jehovah rise with
[1:36:26] a heart swelling that I got a child
[1:36:28] that'll obey me. I've put him through
[1:36:30] the test and he proves that he loves me
[1:36:32] and he believes me. He is certain that I
[1:36:35] am. For it is said, he that cometh to
[1:36:38] God must believe that he is and a
[1:36:40] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[1:36:42] after him. Grant at this hour as we
[1:36:45] commit to
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:36:51] you. And now when we have our heads
[1:36:54] bowed and those that are in need of
[1:36:56] anything, would you stand to your feet
[1:36:58] that wants to place now? If you're not
[1:37:00] certain that he is God, if you're
[1:37:02] certain he is God, is going to keep his
[1:37:04] promise, salvation, healing, whatever it
[1:37:06] is, if you're certain that he's God,
[1:37:08] stand to your feet. If you got someone
[1:37:10] else you want to pray for, stand to your
[1:37:12] feet. If you're certain that he's God,
[1:37:14] make your request known in the
[1:37:15] assemblies of the saints. You're doing
[1:37:17] it as you stand to your feet. I'm
[1:37:20] certain he is God. I believe that he
[1:37:22] keeps his word. And I'm sure that my
[1:37:24] request, I'll lay it under the blood
[1:37:26] right now. If you do that, lay every
[1:37:29] sin. Sin is unbelief. You might be a
[1:37:32] church member, but I'm meaning sin, your
[1:37:34] unbelief. You're laying it down as a
[1:37:36] sacrifice. You're going to sacrifice.
[1:37:38] You're coming to the cross. You're going
[1:37:40] to sacrifice now all your unbelief and
[1:37:42] give it over to him and know that he is
[1:37:44] and you're certain he's got to answer.
[1:37:46] If you're of that, raise up your hand.
[1:37:49] Remain that
[1:37:51] way. Let's all
[1:37:55] stand. Each one of us are going through
[1:37:57] different situations in our lives. Each
[1:38:00] one of us
[1:38:01] have requests. Each one of us have
[1:38:04] situations that need to be dealt with.
[1:38:07] Each one of us have questions to be
[1:38:10] answered. Each one of us have
[1:38:12] concerns. Each one of us have
[1:38:17] problems. Or maybe we just
[1:38:21] need a refilling, a fresh touch.
[1:38:26] Maybe we just need that
[1:38:29] confirmation to know
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:35] that our father is still looking at us
[1:38:38] and our father is still going to answer
[1:38:41] when we come before him with the
[1:38:44] requests. Every head bowed
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:48] tonight. As brother Brandham said, if
[1:38:50] you have a request on your heart, put
[1:38:54] your hand
[1:38:55] up. If you have a request, lift it up
[1:38:58] before
[1:38:59] God. You don't need to come to the
[1:39:02] altar. You don't need to speak it into
[1:39:04] my ear or say anything to any human
[1:39:07] ear. But if you have a request, if you
[1:39:10] have a need, if you have something on
[1:39:13] your
[1:39:14] heart, it could be for you, it could be
[1:39:16] for a family member, it could be for a
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:24] friend, you lift that request up before
[1:39:26] the father. You come before him with
[1:39:30] [Music]
[1:39:34] boldness. And the father looks at
[1:39:39] you and he says, "What do you have need
[1:39:43] of?" The father looks at you and
[1:39:46] says, "What is your
[1:39:49] request? Up to half of my kingdom I will
[1:39:52] give to you."
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:39:59] We know that God would bankrupt heaven
[1:40:02] to save
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:05] one. And whatever the request
[1:40:08] is, whatever the desire is that's on
[1:40:11] your
[1:40:12] [Music]
[1:40:16] heart, God is still here to answer.
[1:40:24] Be
[1:40:26] sure that he's
[1:40:28] God. Be sure that he's your heavenly
[1:40:34] father. And if you are sure in your
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:40] heart that God is and God is your
[1:40:43] [Music]
[1:40:46] father, then we can come to him with
[1:40:48] boldness.
[1:40:50] There's no reason we have to hold back
[1:40:52] and go, "I can't ask this request." But
[1:40:55] God wants us to. God wants us to put him
[1:40:58] to the
[1:40:59] test. He wants us to bring our needs and
[1:41:03] requests before
[1:41:07] him. Lord Jesus, we come into your
[1:41:09] presence tonight, Lord.
[1:41:11] Lord, after reading some scriptures,
[1:41:14] Lord, and Lord, reading the words of
[1:41:16] your
[1:41:17] prophet, Lord, we lift our hands, Lord,
[1:41:20] as we come before you with the requests
[1:41:21] that are on our hearts, Lord. Lord, the
[1:41:24] needs that each one of us have. Each one
[1:41:26] of us are in different situations. Each
[1:41:28] one of us are going through different
[1:41:30] things, going through different
[1:41:31] struggles and
[1:41:33] different different tests and problems
[1:41:35] in life.
[1:41:39] But Lord, you still
[1:41:41] said and you still
[1:41:44] [Music]
[1:41:46] promised that anything that we pray in
[1:41:49] the name of Jesus that you would hear.
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:53] Lord, you promise that if we
[1:41:57] ask that you will
[1:42:00] answer. That if we knock you will open.
[1:42:02] That if we seek we will find.
[1:42:04] [Music]
[1:42:06] Lord, we're not coming in
[1:42:08] [Music]
[1:42:10] with a prosperity gospel. Lord, we're
[1:42:13] not coming
[1:42:14] in thinking that we'll suddenly be
[1:42:17] wealthy and we'll have
[1:42:19] all the things of the world around
[1:42:23] us. But Lord, we're coming to you with
[1:42:25] the boldness of of a child of God
[1:42:28] that Lord, we have needs. We have fields
[1:42:32] in our lives that need to be watered.
[1:42:34] And Lord, we need the springs to be able
[1:42:37] to water them, to be able to help them
[1:42:39] to grow, to help them to flourish. Lord,
[1:42:41] we have lots of loved ones that are
[1:42:45] out that are not living for you. And
[1:42:47] Lord, we need you to go out and get
[1:42:49] them,
[1:42:50] Lord. Lord, we have questions in our
[1:42:53] heart that needs answered. We have
[1:42:55] trials and problems and things we're
[1:42:56] facing that we need you to step in
[1:43:00] and handle, Lord.
[1:43:04] Lord, we have sicknesses in in our
[1:43:06] bodies or we have loved ones that are
[1:43:08] that are
[1:43:09] battling that Lord, we need your healing
[1:43:12] touch right now.
[1:43:14] [Music]
[1:43:18] Lord, it's an awesome thing that we can
[1:43:20] walk into the presence of the
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:25] King and that you'll look at
[1:43:28] us and that you'll
[1:43:30] say, "What do you have need
[1:43:34] of? What is your
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:39] request?" Lord, we thank you for the
[1:43:42] access that we have to your throne.
[1:43:43] Lord, we thank you for the access that
[1:43:46] we have to you to be able to bring you
[1:43:48] these earthly requests,
[1:43:51] Lord. Lord, if we have any sin in our
[1:43:54] lives, any unbelief in our lives, Lord,
[1:43:56] we pray that you would help us to lay it
[1:43:58] down, Lord. Help us to sacrifice it at
[1:44:00] your altar, Lord, and to lift the
[1:44:02] requests before
[1:44:05] you. Lord, we walk away from this
[1:44:07] service tonight expecting to hear great
[1:44:10] things, Lord. expecting to hear praise
[1:44:12] reports about how you moved in different
[1:44:14] situations, how you moved to answer
[1:44:17] questions, how you moved
[1:44:20] to to fix problems, to heal
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:25] diseases, because Lord, we know that
[1:44:31] you can handle every situation that
[1:44:33] comes along,
[1:44:34] Lord. There is nothing too big for you,
[1:44:38] Lord. And Lord, we thank you and we just
[1:44:42] praise your name for it. Lord, we pray
[1:44:43] that you would accept our praise for a
[1:44:46] few moments.
[1:44:49] Lord, may we just enjoy being in your
[1:44:52] presence at this time, Lord. We just
[1:44:54] love you and we thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:45:00] [Music]
[1:45:11] and I will
[1:45:15] follow. Lead me
[1:45:18] Lord,
[1:45:20] I will
[1:45:23] go. You have called
[1:45:27] me. I will
[1:45:31] answer. Lead me
[1:45:34] Lord and I will

[1:46:31] me. I will
[1:46:35] answer. Lead me,
[1:46:37] Lord, and I will
[1:46:44] go. Praise the
[1:46:49] Lord. She
[1:46:51] sing another song.
[1:46:57] Lord, I give you my
[1:47:00] heart. This is my father.
[1:47:05] This is
[1:47:07] my
[1:47:11] desire to

[1:47:20] you. Lord, with all my
[1:47:25] heart I

[1:47:29] [Music]
[1:47:29] [Applause]
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:36] All I have within
[1:47:42] me, I
[1:47:45] give
[1:47:47] you
[1:47:51] praise. All that
[1:47:53] I
[1:47:56] adore is in you.
[1:48:07] Lord, I give you my
[1:48:11] heart. I give you my

[1:48:46] desire to
[1:48:50] honor
[1:48:54] you, Lord. With all my
[1:48:59] heart I worship
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:09] you. All I have within

[1:49:55] Every breath that I
[1:49:58] take, every moment I'm
[1:50:03] awake, Lord, have your way in
[1:50:11] me. I'll continue
[1:50:13] to keep everyone in prayer
[1:50:16] that's traveling. Keep the meetings in
[1:50:20] Virginia in prayer. We also have our
[1:50:23] fundraiser weekend coming up uh Friday
[1:50:27] and
[1:50:28] Saturday. First off, pray for good
[1:50:31] weather. Pray that
[1:50:33] the sun stays out and the rain stays
[1:50:36] away. As brother Michael said, it can
[1:50:39] dump on Sunday.
[1:50:41] Just we need the the ground to dry out a
[1:50:43] little bit. We
[1:50:45] need some nice sunshiny
[1:50:48] weather. And then just pray that the
[1:50:51] Lord bless the
[1:50:55] fundraiser. Continue to remember the
[1:50:58] services on
[1:50:59] [Music]
[1:51:02] Sunday and just continue to pray for one
[1:51:05] another throughout the
[1:51:07] week. Let's go to uh
[1:51:10] C. He's got it all in
[1:51:13] control. He's got it all in control.
[1:51:19] [Music]

[1:51:28] control. He placed that
[1:51:33] reassur out in my
[1:51:39] soul. He's got it all in control.
[1:51:45] [Music]
[1:51:48] I put my life in his
[1:51:55] hands. I put my life in his
[1:52:03] hands. Every road I
[1:52:06] travel I know is in his plan.
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:14] I put my life in his
[1:52:21] hands. He knows what I
[1:52:29] need. My father knows what I
[1:52:36] need. No matter what I go through, he
[1:52:41] knows what's best for me.
[1:52:47] My father knows what I
[1:52:54] need. He's got it all in
[1:53:00] control. You may all dismiss
[1:53:03] yourselves. Lord bless you all.
[1:53:06] And Lord willing, we'll see you on
[1:53:09] Friday and Saturday for the sub
[1:53:11] fundraiser and on Sunday for service
[1:53:14] again. In my
[1:53:19] soul, he's got it all in
[1:53:27] control. I put my life in his hands.
[1:53:33] [Music]
[1:53:43] Every road I

[1:53:52] plans. I put my life in his hands.
