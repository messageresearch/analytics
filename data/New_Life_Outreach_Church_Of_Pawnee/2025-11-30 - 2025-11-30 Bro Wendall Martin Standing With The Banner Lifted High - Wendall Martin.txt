Good to see everyone here this morning and I trust everyone had a had a [music] good Thanksgiving and and um we u uh we sure enjoyed [music] uh Thanksgiving and and got to do a lot of hunting this week and [music] so uh we always look forward to that time of the year and uh get to spend time [music] with with the uh with the boys and the young men And uh so that meant uh a lot to us uh us guys anyways.

Amen. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; And uh so we just say God bless you. Uh good just just good to see everyone here this morning. Good to see brother and uh uh brother and sister fairweather with us here and u trust [applause] y'all had a good time. As good a time as you can have and u been praying for them. Let's look here. Um, I've got a couple of scriptures I'd like to read here this morning. And I'd like to start off with Song of Solomon, uh, the 2 chapter. And, um, brother brother William is, sister Sharon will be with us here, uh, this evening and, uh, Brother William will be ministering here for us. And um um so they they've been over there with brother Sam Parker the last couple days and um so we're glad glad to have them back uh over here in Oklahoma and looking forward to seeing them here this evening. Um, Song of Solomon 2 and 1, it says, this is this is Jesus speaking to his bride. I am the rose of Sharon and the lily of the valleys. As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. the bride. As the um the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so was my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste. He brought me to this to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. And then I'd also like to look here at um Ephesians 5 and 25. It's a familiar passage of scripture. And um [clears throat] uh there in Ephesians 5 and 25. Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he may present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. So the end product is a matured bride. Amen. That he is going to uh present to himself. And then revelations 19 and7 it says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready. Now how was she going to make herself ready? By the word. It was going to be the bleeding word. the word would be presented in such a way it would come to her. Amen. That she would be without spot, wrinkle or blemish. Now it says the bride for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed with fine linen clean and white. For the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints. What is the righteousness? How do we get righteousness? Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness. I want to speak this morning standing under the banner that is lifted high. Let's go to the Lord in prayer. Father, we thank you today for your blessings, the multitudes of your mercies, Lord. Thank you for your word and in our generation and having this confidence, Lord, that all things, Lord, that you you you have given us everything that we have need of to come into that complete maturity with you. Now, Lord, you you see as our uh there's there's several missing this morning and maybe we're still with family and I just pray Lord that you be with all of them. I ask Lord that your Holy Spirit would be here with us this morning as we uh set at your feet as it were to to hear from you and ask that you would minister to our hearts, Lord. Let your words hit the target, Father. And we'll give you glory and honor in Jesus name we pray. Can the church say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And amen. God bless you. You may be seated here this morning. [clears throat] So we we have this in our in our thoughts here this morning standing under the banner lifted high and um um my my thoughts is is uh to to sort of go along with last with last week and that is amen the emblem uh of our country the the banner that was given to to us the end sign that was was um sent to us from our homeland. &gt;&gt; And um as as the banner, the end sign was lifted up there in Auajima for for those um as they were they were in the middle of a very fierce battle. thousands and thousands had given their life and um and there were going to be um and and and they were still going to be in the war. But this battle was very strategic. It was a very strategic battle and it would um and and there as they they fought um u as I say thousands died within a couple of days as they were trying to uh conquer Auima and and and as they got to the highest point of that island they um they lifted up they hoisted up the flag and that flag the picture of that flag went around the world and it gave courage to the Americans even at home. Amen. The the brave men and women that were or the brave men that were fighting in that battle and um Amen. It gave courage. It it that and that that was a that was an emblem of America that was they were stating that that we we have taken this hill and we will take the battle. Yeah, &gt;&gt; we will we will win the war. And and how that Jesus it was Amen. Jesus came amen to this country came to came to earth. Amen. To redeem me and you. and that that cross will ever more be an emblem of that heavenly country as God has declared, I have purchased. I have won the war. I have now there's going to be [snorts] many more battles. There's going to be many more soldiers that go down, if you will. Amen. They're going to die throughout the ages, but the emblem is still there. And Sister Keys, if you wouldn't mind just just putting that flag back up uh of of Auima and and that this this here, Amen. would become an incredible um uh emblem of the of the uh of of victory for the United States. And &gt;&gt; the photographer there would become a very famous man with that picture. And here the men are in in the in the rubble and and the wars been going on there. I mean, there's there's there's thousands, they say six um I I believe I believe at up to that point there were 6,000 uh Japanese killed in that in that that two-day period. And and if I'm remembering right, 2,000 American soldiers had been killed in that in that period of time. But and but they they their their their uh tenacity, their um their vigor, they they they wanted to claim that heel &gt;&gt; and that would become a a focal point. That would become a rallying point for the rest. And the morale of the soldiers would say we can continue to fight. Then we then we find if you wouldn't mind putting the cross up there. And then this one here has ever more been a a an emblem for you and for me. &gt;&gt; That is that is forever more an emblem from our home country telling the soldiers, you must fight. &gt;&gt; You must fight. Amen. This Christ here has paid the price. Keep on pressing on because the day is coming where he's going to call all of his people home. He's going to call all of his soldiers home. &gt;&gt; And so today, amen, as as I continue maybe, Amen. uh under the banner or the in sign the the emblem that God has sent. I am I I want us to look at it from the the groom and the bride and how that how that there is God has promised that there would be a a a bride that he was going to pull out of the peoples of the earth, the denominations of the earth. and he would he would bring a bride into maturity and and there and it's going to look like uh uh many times a hopeless case many times even even in ourselves today as the as as as the bride of Jesus Christ that we believe amen is coming in this generation Jesus is coming to take us home and our emblem is still ever more the cross &gt;&gt; it was the bloody bleed ing word there on Calvary that would forever more. Amen. Uh uh uh it it'd be healing to the wounded. It would be forgiveness to their sins. It would be [applause] forever more. It would be God's grace to his people as as he brings us home. Can you say amen? This bride when we talk about the bride age it means that the bride has come of age that she has been given righteousness. Amen. Her faith has come. When we talk about THE BRIDE IT'S HER faith has come to maturity and to completeness. She has heard the complete interpretation of the word. and and and so and I and I want to say we're not living in a partial revelation. We're living in the complete revelation of God. Now, this is important because up to this age, amen, the church has lived in in in a in a partial revelation. There were still symbols. There were there there were still many things of the of the Bible that were still held under under uh a veil. Amen. It was not a complete revelation. Now, we've had the Bible, but as long as it is in mystery form, as long as it is in symbol form, THEN OUR FAITH COULD NOT come to its completion. And without faith coming to its maturity, there cannot be a a a righteous or a matured bride. Amen. That God has called to do us to be. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So it required a perfect word. AMEN. TO BRING OUR FAITH past Baptist, past Methodist, past Pentecost into a completion that can believe God for anything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so we so we we want us to look at that here this morning. And I want us to say the bride is not looking at herself. The bride is not looking at at at at her weaknesses. The bride is not looking at her accomplishments. The bride is coming into a revelation that it is all Christ and Christ alone. &gt;&gt; I believe that is the greatest sign of maturity is I cannot do it. &gt;&gt; I must have his grace in my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe that the great the the the closer we the the closer WE COME INTO THIS revelation Amen. our haltiness begins to to fade away and our humility and our complete reliance upon him in saying I want to please you Lord. I want your blessings upon me. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So a partial word it it could only bring an underdeveloped bride. Only an UNDER THAT THAT'S THAT'S ALL A PARTIAL WORD COULD BRING. AMEN. IS AN UNDERDEVELOPED BRIDE. THAT underdeveloped means not fully developed. In photography it would mean not developed sufficiently to give a normal image. So the image of of of the word the IMAGE OF OF CHRIST IN THE BRIDE WAS NOT in its fullness. Amen. Because it was underdeveloped. BUT WHEN THE FULLNESS OF THE word would COME OR WHEN GOD REMOVES THE VEIL AND the mysteries of the symbols are are are are set are are open to us, then we can see the finality. Amen. What God has been doing and what he is doing. Brother Brandham would say, Amen. 1 Corinthians 13, he he would he would read this scripture when that which is perfect has come, THAT WHICH IS IN PART SHALL BE DONE AWAY WITH. So all these little things of jumping up and down like a kid and trying to talk in tongues and all these other things WHEN THAT WHICH IS PERFECT we do have and we do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation of the word with divine inter uh divine in vindication then that which is in part is done away with. When I was a child, I spake as a child. I understood as a child, but when I become a man, I put away childish things. Amen. So, so we would say we would that doesn't mean that that that the that tongues and and and interpretation and visions are are done away with. It is that there IS A MATURITY THAT has taken PLACE AND THAT BRIDE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS DONE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Not none of this trying to make it happen. None of this trying to speak in tongues. None of this trying to bring the presence of God. We understand his word is the only source FOR VICTORY. HIS WORD IS THE ONLY SOURCE. AMEN. For overcoming. That's right. AMEN. BUT AGAIN, IT'S NOT A MENTAL CONCEPTION. It is a divine revelation within her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, bless the name of the Lord. Amen. It it is it is saying that the little girl has come of age and she is now responsible for for she she's now ready for responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. All things are set in order for THOSE IN THE BRIDE will do only his will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have thus sayaith the Lord or they keep still. &gt;&gt; Amen. WE KNOW THAT GOD HAS THAT IT HAS TO BE GOD in them doing the work. Amen. Let me say it and read it again. THEY KNOW THAT IT HAS TO BE GOD in them doing the works, fulfilling his word. He did not complete all things while on his earthly ministry. So now he works in and through the bride. &gt;&gt; She knows that. For it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do. BUT HE WILL NOW FULFILL THROUGH THE bride that work which we which he left for this specific time. Can you SAY AMEN? SO THE BRIDE IS COMING. WHAT ARE WE FIGHTING? WE'RE NOT FIGHTING A A A war of a man of uh uh you know trying to to do something for God. WE ARE FIGHTING UNDER THAT BANNER. &gt;&gt; We're fighting UNDER THE BANNER OF THAT bleeding word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. WE'RE FIGHTING UNDER THAT BANNER. A PARTIAL WORD IN IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, A PARTIAL WORD COULD ONLY GIVE A SUBSTITUTE LAMB, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; A A PARTIAL WORD. AMEN. BUT IT WAS IN THE FULLNESS of time WHEN THE WORD WAS COMING TO ITS completion is when Amen. the word OF GOD IS IS WHEN THE LAMB OF GOD COME IN. WELL, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There have been thousands and thousands and thousands of of lambs that were killed for atonement all through since since the the fall of ADAM AND EVE UP UNTIL Christ had come. THE OLD TESTAMENT believer uh uh UH WAS WAS ACCEPTED BY GOD THROUGH THOSE LAMBS. AMEN. It was not the perfect plan or it was not the perfect word, but it was BRINGING THEM AS A SUBSTITUTE TO A COMPLETION UNTIL THE PERFECT SON OF GOD WOULD COME AND LAY DOWN HIS LIFE TO REDEEM A BRIDE. NOW I want you TO CATCH THAT. THIS PARTIAL WORD, there was a little bit from this prophet and this prophet and THIS PROPHET. THE PARTIAL WORD COULD ONLY PROVIDE A SUBSTITUTE. &gt;&gt; Now it rolled the sin ahead from year to year since it could not remit sin. But the Old Testament saints were looking to that perfect redeemer that was to come. &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOING TO BE GOD living in a body again here on the earth. &gt;&gt; IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE WHAT HAD FALLEN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN. And it would be in the it would be in the body of a human being, a son of God, right here on planet Earth. Well, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In the middle of Satan's Eden, Amen. IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF SIN AND CHAOS, God would raise up a man AND GOD WOULD SO BE PLEASED WITH THAT BODY. AMEN. THAT WHEN JESUS DIED, HE WOULD BECOME GOD'S PERFECT LAMB. &gt;&gt; He would be the perfect lamb. &gt;&gt; And and and that that complete that body, that word, AMEN. HANGING ON CALVARY, HANGING ON THE CROSS. THAT'S NOT JUST AN ORDINARY MAN there now. That's not just an ORDINARY HUMAN. THAT WAS [screaming] GOD'S COMPLETION. IT WAS ALL OF THE COMPLETION OF PROPHECY IN THE BODY OF A MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. [applause] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT MAKES THAT PICTURE SO INCREDIBLE. &gt;&gt; NO MAN COULD DO THAT. &gt;&gt; COME ON. &gt;&gt; NO HUMAN BEING COULD PROVIDE. AMEN. BUT BECAUSE IT WAS THE completion of God's word, IT WAS THE COMPLETE GOD'S [screaming] GREAT PLAN OF REDEMPTION WAS UNFOLDED in that man hanging on Calvary. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That that great man would become an emblem forever more of mercy, forgiveness, healing. Well, can you say amen? Amen. Now, it is in that time, and I want you to just stick with me here for a moment because I'm referring to this Old Testament, in order for you to understand where you're at today. As we're going through this, I want you to also say, I want you to look as there was a completion, there was 4,000 years, amen, from from Adam till the time that Christ came and all of this other Amen. There was just pieces of the puzzle coming together. pieces of the puzzle until it was all revealed in body form IN THE BODY OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; NOW, I want you to as I'm teaching this, I want you to also catch this that there has also been a amen something in THE MAKING. THE BRIDE STARTED OUT UNDER THE the the son of man ministry. The same ministry that Jesus had was in that early church. BUT SOMEHOW [screaming] SOMEWHERE THEY LEFT THEIR FIRST LOVE AND SHE FELL AGAIN. AND SO GOD HAS BEEN LITTLE BY LITTLE HERE'S BEEN THIS DENOMINATION and that denomination and this and and BUT IT'S BEEN SLOWLY BUT SURELY BRINGING US [screaming] OUT AND TO A COMPLETION AGAIN. AND GOD IS HALLELUJAH. It's got we she's got a he's got a bride without spot, wrinkle or blemish. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; And he to her is like an apple tree in the desert. And she to him, Amen. He uh uh uh uh you know, Lily, he he's looking at her. Amen. As as the fairest AMONG ALL OF THE DAUGHTERS, there is a love relationship. GOD'S WORD IS NOW COMING IN COMPLETION IN the woman that he has redeemed. Am I making sense? &gt;&gt; Now, now I I I hope this makes sense because Jesus WAS WAS COMING. GOD [screaming] WAS REVEALING HIMSELF. NOW, I want you to catch this in indictment. The prophet would tell us, he said, "Now notice how appropriate was now showing that Jerusalem was ceasing when it was in effect until that hour, the crucifixion." He says the the blood of the lamb was all right until that day. But now at the crucifixion, it changes. The old system is done. There is a new one. And the lamb was at the sacrifice. The lamb, the sacrificial LAMB WAS ON THE GROUNDS. They were condemning and doing the very thing they had to do. That's right. Amen. Then he looks to you and he says, "God be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly life in this last day." Because the churches are doing the same thing today until the hour that organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ's word. And from then on comes the word and the word only. From the pascal lamb passed away. AMEN. CHRIST BECOME our lamb at the day of crucifixion and the day THAT THE DENOMINATION HAS CRUCIFIED THE word of God and accepted a creed in thestead of the word that's the day the word comes into full effect and that's just been recently so brother Bradam IS TRYING TO SHOW us here that the bride there had to be a crucifixion then of that perfect word and there has to be a crucifixion today of that perfect word. Now, the animal blood atoned up until Jesus crucifixion. After that, Amen. After the crucifixion, things had changed. Amen. No man was ever accepted. Uh but using the old lamb, none of that. They they couldn't take the woolly lamb anymore and bring him up and and they could say, "Well, I I I'm doing it the way that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob done it." They could say, "Well, well, Moses said to do it this way." Amen. You mean to tell me THAT MOSES WAY DOESN'T work anymore, right? They could say all of these things, but the word HAD COME TO ITS FULLNESS. What is its fullness? And the Bible says, "In the fullness of time, God sent forth his son made of a woman." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? SO THE OLD SYSTEM OF PARTIAL WORD WAS NO LONGER ACCEPTED. WHY? BECAUSE JESUS WAS THE COMPLETE WORD. &gt;&gt; JESUS WAS THE FULLNESS. HE COULD STAND THERE AND SAY, "SEARCH the scriptures &gt;&gt; for they declare who I am." &gt;&gt; That's good. Now today, God is still in his word in his bride. &gt;&gt; I want you to just catch that as we as we go along. You see, the Holy Ghost was given in portion to those Old Testament prophets. Amen. They were moved upon by the Holy Ghost. All the prophets of the Old Testament. Amen. It was the spirit by portion on those prophets. Amen. But you see, John was told though the one that you see the spirit descends upon and stays upon, that's going to be the lamb of God. And then John would say on that one day, he would say, UH, UH, BEHOLD THE LAMB OF God which takes away the sin of the world. They could not EVER GO BACK &gt;&gt; ON &gt;&gt; to that old woolly land. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that the veil was totally rent. There was the veil was rent. There was no u uh there they were. They were in there sacrificing their human l or their their their their woolly lambs. They were in there sacrificing the lambs the same time that Jesus was hanging on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. Jesus was hanging on Calvary the same time that they were offering their lambs just like just like all of their fathers had done. Moses had commanded that Abraham offered a lamb. All of these had offered lamb. They are doing it according to what was told them taught them of the past. &gt;&gt; But they DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THAT WAS ALL IN TYPES AND SHADOWS UNTIL THE REAL CAME. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; SO THEY WANTED TO CONTINUE ON. AND THE BIBLE says there there were the sacred priest walking in behind the veil that no one else was. No one had ever seen behind that veil except for the high priest. No one had ever walked in there. And the Bible says while they were doing that, Jesus was up there crying. And when he said, "It is finished," &gt;&gt; the veil rent in that temple from top to bottom. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And here THE HUMAN PRIEST STANDING THERE EXPOSED. And there the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat was there exposed before all the people. The people were gasping. No one had ever seen the the mercy seat. No one has ever Hallelujah. Come on. &gt;&gt; IT WAS GOD SAYING THAT THE MERCY SEAT IS NO longer in a temple BEHIND A VEIL. THE MERCY SEAT IS IN A HUMAN BODY. [screaming] JESUS CHRIST THAT WAS DYING ON CALVARY. &gt;&gt; The people couldn't understand that. They could not accept THAT GOD RESIDED IN THAT HUMAN TABERNACLE. &gt;&gt; Come on. Think about it. &gt;&gt; You catching me? &gt;&gt; The people today have made Christianity a religious format. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; They're just a religious thing. Going to church. And these days, they've got to doctor it up a little bit because, man, going to church is pretty boring. Amen. And so we got to have light shows and we got to we got to paint the stage every other month and we got to do we got to do everything we can to keep the people wanting to come back to church &gt;&gt; and that's see they miss it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; now now Jesus now now brother Brandon I want I want to I I well let let me just go on here. Amen. Yes there was still mercy. There was still mercy. There was still blood. But it was not in the old system. It was now in Jesus Christ. Yes, there was mercy. God's provided place of worship was now in Christ. So, Brother Brandon would say when that veil rent at Calvary, the mercy seat came into plain view, what happened? It was hanging on Calvary dripping in blood. As they had took the blood year after year at the cleansing of the sanctuary and the sprinkling of the mercy seat there, GOD WITH HIS GREAT MIGHTY stroke of lightning power split the old badger veil from top to bottom and the mercy seat came into plain view. The real genuine lamb of God was hanging in plain view on Calvary. That's the real mercy seat. When God had paid the price himself and become one of us and had manifested himself as a man to get acquainted with us and we acquainted with him, the mercy seat was in plain view of all Israel on that day of atonement. Oh, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That day that day the the scripture says that the that that that the uh uh he cried out, "It is finished." When Jesus rose from the dead, the Old Testament saints rose up with him because he truly was that word that come to perfection for them. Now, now, now I again now get and now get this. Did not the scripture say that the they without us cannot come into completion or perfection? &gt;&gt; Just as that word in Jesus had to come in its completion in order for all of those Old Testament saints, there is a bride that has got to come into her completion. They without us cannot be made perfect. Right. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now, I I I don't I now I Hey, I've been hunting all week and so uh uh I may be a little bit tired, but I'm wanting to get my point to y'all here this morning and I hopefully I'll do a good job. Praise the Lord. Now, Amen. You can still hunt and and and study and and uh but I've been getting up at 2:30 every morning. A every morning. We've got up at 2:30 for a whole week. Amen, guys. And uh uh and we and we hunted all day long. Praise the Lord. But uh you know uh uh but but what I what I AM WANT I WANT TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT THAT THAT ATONEMENT THAT FLAG THAT THAT CALL THAT THAT GOD had had given us. Amen. And this this message is not a banner of of religion. This message was God's banner of of completion. &gt;&gt; When when when Jesus says it IS FINISHED, IT IS ALSO BEEN CRIED THE SAME in our day. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Time shall be no more. &gt;&gt; Now catch the the similarities of the Old Testament. IN THE FULLNESS of time, GOD'S SON CAME BORN OF A WOMAN. HE CRIED, "IT is finished." At the end of the church age, COMING THROUGH THE SEVEN CHURCH AGES, THERE'S ALSO GOING TO BE A COMPLETION WHERE THE SON OF MAN COMES IN A body [screaming] and declares, "Time shall be no more." &gt;&gt; In other words, no more delay. The completion is coming. The completion is coming. The flag, the emblem has been raised. &gt;&gt; Saying the time of end is growing near. &gt;&gt; I'm not delaying this anymore. &gt;&gt; I I'm not going to put this in in in symbol form anymore. I'm not going TO I'M GOING TO OPEN IT ALL [screaming] UP. THE VEIL THAT HAS BEEN OVER YOUR EYES THROUGHOUT [screaming] ALL OF THESE AGES. THESE SEVEN AGES OF DENOMINATIONALISM. SEVEN AGES OF MAMA SAID AND DADDY SAID AND DOCTOR SAID AND THIS ONE SAID THE SEVEN AGES OF OF OF OF THIS SEMINARY VERSUS THIS SEMINARY AND THAT DENOMINATION VERSUS THAT DENOMINATION. IN THE IN THE IN THE FINALITY [screaming] OF IT ALL, GOD SENDS US A MESSAGE. GOD SENDS US HIS WORD. IT'S THE WORD COMING OF CHRIST THAT SAYS TIME [screaming] SHALL BE NO MORE. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a completion of that word &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; For there has come. Well, praise the Lord. Now, when God God began to brood over that after the fall, he brought up an Enoch. He brought up an Elijah. He brought up a Moses. He brought up a prophet after prophet trying to restore that image again. Finally, upon the earth came the genuine image again. Finally in the image of God himself again which was God the logos made flesh and dwelt among us. And now that same logos has a part. He's got a pride. The same logos the word cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation which the prophets car was carriers of that seed. The church denominations has been carriers to that seed. Now, now notice quickly, but like the shuck, it hugs, it holds on the seed now. Then it leaves her. And Jesus was God. His father was the great logos itself. And he could not pour it in in in it all in Moses. Amen. For he was a prophet. The word of the Lord always, never fails. Comes to that prophet. No place, no time in the Bible since the Bible that the correct interpretation of the word comes to a theologian. it it's not in the scriptures. See, neither never did the Pharisees or the Sadducees, never did God raise uh never did God raise a prophet out any of them. Never does he do it in the last days. Amen. Another place he says the sun comes across and ripens the grain. It can't ripen it all at once. It goes on to maturing constantly ripens it until it comes to a full ear. So is it with the church today. It started in his infasy back in the dark age where it was under the ground and now it's and it's growed now in to maturity. &gt;&gt; Now growing now into maturity. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now it says this book has not been revealed until the seven church ages, denominational ages has run out. There's no more time. [snorts] It's it's only revealed after the church ages and denominations have run out. And that's the reason M thing is is in such a scruple tonight. They pick up the doctrine. They run off to one side and say this is it. Another picks up another doctrine runs out to this side and says this is it. Each one builds anomination under it. Amen. But still in it all all of it. You see the confusion. People are wondering what's the truth. Are you hearing me? Amen. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; Now, now I'm going to but but again, as we read while ago, but God blessed God be blessed for seeing this wonderful heavenly light in this last day. The churches is doing the same thing until the hour that the organization religion is condemned and proved to be sacrificing Christ's word. But from then on comes the word and the word only. The pascal lamb passed away and Christ become our lamb at the day of crucifixion. And the day that the denomination crucified the word of God and accepted a creed instead of the word, that's the day when the word comes into full effect. And he's talking about you. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, as we as we look at this standing under that banner, Amen. standing there under the banner. Now, what is he what is he doing? What is the groom doing when [clears throat] he's calling his wife? He's giving her he's giving her righteousness. How is he giving her righteousness? By giving her faith. Did you know that the only thing that you cannot add to your temple is faith? That's the foundation to to to the to to the to the statue was faith. &gt;&gt; The only thing God supernaturally gives you. So righteousness is faith. Faith comes by hearing. Not denomination, not mama, not daddy, not preacher, not faith comes from hearing the word of God. &gt;&gt; It comes from that. So the word that has been given to us in this day &gt;&gt; is to is to amen to turn in is to equal faith. So when you've got perfect word, it is to bring about perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Now if there's [clears throat] ever a time to get out of legalism, this is the time. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; Because legalism will turn on you. It'll turn on you like a bad dog. &gt;&gt; It'll do it. Oh, that bad dog will be right there defending you, defending you, defending you. But one of these days, he's going to turn and eat you. &gt;&gt; He's going to turn and that that bad dog, oh, it's after everybody. Amen. And it'll all be in the name of God. It'll all be in the name of Christianity. But you watch, you remember this. The accuser of the brethren is the devil. &gt;&gt; That's the accuser of the brethren. And when that devil is right there and he's wanting to make you more spiritual than somebody else, you just you just watch this. Brother Brandham TAUGHT US, YOU WATCH THAT MAN THAT'S THAT'S GOT A MORE PECULIAR REVELATION OR THAT ACTS A LITTLE MORE spiritual than everyone else because he's got a wrong spirit upon him. and at the end will prove what he's got. &gt;&gt; Now, we've seen that. We've seen that in the religious circles. The bride [screaming] is not relying on her herself or her revelations or whatever. She is A PART OF THIS GREAT BODY THAT was the one body of God. NOW WE ARE THE collective body of God and he's going to be revealed in that collective body. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, why why do I say that is because only faith is going to bring that about as long as there are condemnation in us. And condemnation I I I want us I want us I want us to really look at conviction and condemnation. Condemnation is you are walking away from the word of God. Amen. You're doing things contrary to the word of God. Condemnation comes in and and and beats you down for that. Conviction, on the other hand, tells you you're wrong. Amen. And line it up with the word of the Lord. And then it it also points back to election. It's coming back. Listen, this is not who you are. You are my bride. Amen. Let's let's get bring there's plenty of blood. Wash yourself. The bride has made herself ready. Condemnation is saying you you you are worthless. You never will be bride. You never will. You're just you, man. Look look look back. You can look back these last 30 years and you still going into the same old hang-ups. YOU'RE STILL DOING THAT'S the old condemnation. Conviction. The greater THE WORD, THE GREATER THE CONVICTION. THE GREATER THE LIGHT, THE GREATER THE THE MORE YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF in the image of that mirror. &gt;&gt; IF THERE'S NO LIGHT, NO MATTER HOW [screaming] HOW GOOD AND PURE THE mirror is, IF THERE'S NO LIGHT, YOU CANNOT CORRECT YOURSELF. &gt;&gt; BUT AS LIGHT COMES, YOU CAN LOOK IN THAT MIRROR AND THEN YOU CAN YOU can comb your hair better. You can brush your teeth. You can you CAN SEE THE SPOTS ON YOUR GARMENTS. [snorts] IT'S WITH THE LIGHT, WITH THE REVELATION. AND WHAT I'M SAYING HERE TODAY, AMEN. WE'RE NOT IN THE PARTIAL REVELATION. WE'RE IN THE COMPLETE REVELATION. &gt;&gt; NOT TO CONDEMN, BUT TO CONVICT. [screaming] &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we walk under conviction, now again, legalism is is is is a set of things that we've got in our mind, the way things can be, and will ignore everything else. Conviction is going to let you see who you are. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now you remember you remember the the five or the 10 cow bride eight cow bride. It was I believe it was the eight cow bride. Now I've told the story. Y'all remember the story? &gt;&gt; Do I need to tell the story? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so there was this um there was this uh this is a true story and I and I'm and I'm I'm repeating this from from from memory so I may have a few of my facts wrong but majority of it's going to be right. The the the story is about a a a uh there was a man who had a whole house of daughters and and um and they were man they were some fine fine women and and um it was over there in one of the African countries and um uh so this this u this uh uh you know, one by one, these girls were getting married off and and and they would bring in a you know, they they have their diary, the a man that wanted to to to marry one of the girls. I mean, he bring a chicken or, you know, a couple chickens, whatever they could afford. they could bring a a cow or uh bring something and they'd give it to the father as a diary and in in exchange for his for his daughter and he would give away, you know, give give his daughter to to be married. But there was this one this this one uh man he had uh he had this one girl that just she was just so ugly and untidied and and um very very backward. He would not I mean she when you when you when you seen her she she very seldom went went went out in public and when she did she kept her head down. and her hair was all she she just didn't take care of herself and it just and um uh just very shy and just oh my complex after complex after complex and and so um and and everyone pastor up. But but one day there there come a prince that had that had come through the the community that through this this this township and and and he and he noticed this girl. And there's something about that girl that really struck his struck his eyes, struck his heart. And uh he he he caught her one day and was talking to her. She just she was just so bashful and so and uh uh he says, "You know, I'd like to get to know you a little bit more." And she she just barely look up at him and just, you know, and and they they they talked a little bit and she said, "My, you know, listen, I have nothing to give you. My my sisters are all pretty. They're all married. They're all ve they've married very prominent people, but I listen I and u but uh you know don't I I I I'd never make a good wife. And uh well finally, Amen. He went and talked to her daddy and he says, "Listen, I I like your daughter and I I I'm I'd really like her to be my wife." And the man says, "Say what? You want her to nothing. But I listen. You get what you get. I mean, she's always been this way. And And uh I I I can't guarantee you what. And he says, "I love her and I want to marry her." And uh he he looked at her and he and he says and and and I want to give a diary. And you know the dad I you know I think the the the best he had ever been given was two cows and for his other daughters I mean he had got as low as just a couple of chickens and and uh and he says I'm willing to give eight cows. The man looked at her, looked at him and said, "Eight cows." No one had ever heard of eight cows. He says, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm the prince of the king of of our tribe." And and he's sitting there. There he is in this lovely little little lonely house and he's he said, "And you want my daughter?" Well, he ended up he ended up uh marrying the daughter and well so that was a good story and that and had been heard. Well, this there was this this journalist that had heard about this and he wanted to know what ever happened what ever happened to this eight cow bride. And so he had he had left. It was either it was either the UK or the US the US. I can't remember exactly how it went, but they they went and found the place and got and found the tra and got up and they found they they they found the uh he was he was asking all around who is this woman? Where is she at? Where does And they said, "Oh, you'll see her here shortly. You'll see her." And they said, "Oh, she's you'll know her when you see her." And so he was looking for ugly, you know. And about that time, here comes here comes a a very poised woman walking and um and and and all these all these others all around her. And as she's coming through, they're offering her, "You want this kind of fruit?" I mean, as she walks in the whole everywhere she goes, just demands the attention of everybody. And they he goes, "Well, who's this woman?" He says, "This is the woman that you want to see. This is our princess. He goes, "No, not not that. Not that woman. This woman's beautiful." And she turned around and looked at him. Her hair was so beautiful. Her skin was so beautiful. She was dressed. She act as elegant a as a prince. And those around her were giving her respect. And finally he he he got an audience. He said, "Can I talk with you?" And the woman looked at him kindly and said, "Sure." So he introduces himself and they begin to talk and she said, "Yes, it's all true. I had seen myself through the eyes of all of my sisters. I'd seen their beauty. I'd seen their all the boys always come to look after them. They never asked me. I I I had I I was empty. I had nothing. She said, "But the day the prince came to my house and he offered my daddy a cow dowy for me. She said something happened. &gt;&gt; I felt value. I felt loved. He was willing to give eight cows for me. She says, "When I found that it was a real promise," she said, "Something welled up on the inside. I started fixing myself up and I started and the and the prince started delighting in me and and started teaching me. Amen. The ways of the palace and &gt;&gt; and the ways of &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And she says, "Here I am today. I am who I am." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because of the prince's love to me. I think of that when I look at when I'm still talking about that emblem. I'm talking about that banner over me is love. His banner, his banner of perfection, his banner of mercy, his banner, Christ the living word. Christ come in this day in THE GREATEST OF ALL. HE HIMSELF came &gt;&gt; and give us a message. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Saying the father's riches are very real. The land is very real. I'm going to open up the mysteries to you. I'm going TO GIVE OF MYSELF. I'M GOING TO SHARE that only my country knows. Are you hearing me? What does it do? It's not in the legalism. NOW THERE IS A LOVE THAT IS BEING EXPRESSED BACK to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He loved me. When I fail, it grieves me to no end. But I know I'm his. &gt;&gt; I know I'm his. &gt;&gt; I know I'm his. Well, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, the prophet in the opening of the seals, and I'm closing now. The prophet in the opening of the seals, Amen. He is he he he he is he's expressing something in the breach and and and he's he's he's talking about he's been an intercessor and he's now Mary can't be an intercessor then none of these others can be intercessors St. Francis St. in a none of these can be intercessors. He he says, "Amen." John never saw thousands of saints come out of the minatorial. He saw a lamb come out. &gt;&gt; He saw a lamb come out in this day. Amen. And I don't care how many saints have been slain. They were all do it. Every one of us like the thief on the cross. We've sinned. We're do this. But this man does nothing. He was he was the only man who was worthy. And here he come from the intercessory box. What what's he coming for now? John was weeping. What's going to happen? And then said, "Don't weep, John." Amen. Here comes the lion. And he and the one that has prevailed and and he looked and here come a lamb that is bloody that had been slain. Amen. This this this one that had been that had died on Calvary 2,000 years ago. Amen. He's been interceding for every one of us. Are you all understanding now? He's been doing it for all the seven ages. &gt;&gt; But at the end time, &gt;&gt; at the end time, the lamb comes forth, takes the seals off the book &gt;&gt; because there is a woman who has come of age &gt;&gt; and he begins to reveal. Amen. He says now, he says he comes forth with what? To take his claims now. Oh my. He comes forth to take his claims. Now he had done the kinsman work. He had come down, become a man, and died. He's done the kinsman work of redemption, but had not as of yet called for his claim. Now he comes on the scene to claim his rights. Amen. For which he was slain. For as becoming a kinsman to die in his place to redeem him. But the elder was right when he called him a lion. The elder called him a lion. Said a lion because he he had been a lamb, an intercessor, a bloody lamb. But now he's come forth. His days of intercession is over. Let him be filthy that is filthy steel. Let him that's righteous be righteous still. And and and and he goes on down. He says he stepped forth from eternity to take the title deed book to break the seals and reveal the mysteries when at the end time. Can you say amen? What's he doing it for? &gt;&gt; It was then that he says, "Oh, come out from underneath the bed. Come out. Get you're mine." &gt;&gt; Before it was it was to whosoever will. But he's coming so specific in this day. And he's saying, "Mary, you're mine. Sister Karen, you're mine. Brother Steve, you're mine." Amen. Jerene Martin, you're mine. It's God. He's coming. And what does it do? You look around and you think of all the denominations, of all the great preachers, of all of the of all of the famous SINGERS AND EVERYTHING THAT'S IN THE LAND, and yet God has come down unveiling your worth. Right. &gt;&gt; Well, John, give us We don't We don't need We don't need a reporter to come and tell us the end or come and interview us later. We don't have to even guess. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you were to read that entire chapter of Revelations that I just read, the Bible says, "All of heaven was rejoicing. Oh, they were all shouting hallelujah, thunders, and voices of many water. They were all screaming, "The Lamb and his bride, &gt;&gt; the Lamb and his bride." And they would scream out, "The bride, the Lamb's wife has made herself ready." &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? What caused it? It was God sending a banner. God sending that message to us in this day. &gt;&gt; You look in the mirror. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't want you to look in them with your that self-righteous look will will will will cause you to overlook a whole bunch of self about yourself. A whole bunch of stuff that that self-righteous look towards this one and pious towards that one and towards that one. Amen. But when you take that all out and you look in the mirror of God's word, you say, "Oh, that hair's out of place. Oh, I can fix that. Oh, I could come on now." And when you're doing that, what are you what are you doing? Amen. It's God's righteousness coming upon us. We're just believing his word. &gt;&gt; We're just believing his word. &gt;&gt; And the You say, "BROTHER WENDLE, FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD." THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT. GOD'S GOT TO give you faith. &gt;&gt; The message HAS COME TO GIVE YOU FAITH. You can do the works. And that's how we've seen that. &gt;&gt; Sure. How many people in our church has come through here that were brilliant that could memorize the seven church ages and the seven seals and they they could quote that thing like nobody's business. But where are they at today? &gt;&gt; But when God comes with divine revelation to you, it's not in memorizing everything. &gt;&gt; It's in accepting it. &gt;&gt; The prince finds value in me. &gt;&gt; The prince finds value in me. Praise the Lord. as the musicians come. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, his banner over me. I'm living under the banner. &gt;&gt; Amen. Living under that banner. &gt;&gt; Praise that. Is lifted high. It's lifted high, folks. It's ran around this world. It's it it went around the world seven times. G, &gt;&gt; man, &gt;&gt; it's lifted high. When you hear a preacher preaching it, what that that that should make you want to rejoice. Oh, his banner over me is love. When you read the Bible, you're saying, "Oh, his banner over me is love." When when you're hearing when you're hearing the messenger preach, Amen. listening to the message, it's his banner over me is divine love. &gt;&gt; Divine love. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're not an eight cow bride. Amen. You're a give all. He gave everything. He gave everything. [music and applause] I I like what brother Wayne said one time, you know, talking about false those false teachers is how can [music] they even begin to start to teach correct when they deny the advent of the prophet messenger that brought the spoken word, the original spoken When we get that, we understand that that was God's divine grace upon us. And how thankful I am [music] for that divine grace. Hallelujah. Oh, he's so wonderful, isn't he? Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. It just it just makes it makes my [music] heart makes my heart to to rejoice. And um you know the he said after after 2,000 years he's sending someone who is so far from organization education in the world of religion that is John the Baptist and Elijah of old. He will hear only from God and he will have thus sayaith the Lord and speak for God. He will be God's mouthpiece and he as it is declared in Malachi 4 and6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers. He will bring back that elect in the last days. They will hear a vindicated prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul and he will restore that truth as they had had it. And those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works. Hallelujah. Do you see it? Now, did you did you get that? &gt;&gt; His manner over me. &gt;&gt; His banner over me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. He says, if you look back the history, he said, man, they they you've had all these denominations and organizations. They had Luther had it for a while and they went then Wesley and they took the revelation and then Amen. He says he says you know he says [music] until he says the Methodists have failed and God has raised up others and and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age. Yes sir. Church is no longer the vow of God. It's its own mouthpiece. &gt;&gt; He says, "God is turning on her and he will confound her through the prophet and the bride. For the voice of God will be in her. &gt;&gt; She's not the average lady. She's not the average woman. She's his bride." Why did they crucify Jesus? Cuz he said, "I and my father are one." And the world will despise you for saying, "I am the bride of Jesus Christ." They'll despise that. But God is in his bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Someone's got to believe it. They ain't going to. You might as well believe it about yourself. &gt;&gt; You can't ask someone else to believe it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. But he said that he will confound it to the prophet the bride. The voice of God will be in her. Yes. It says last chapter of Revelations verse 17, spirit and the bride say come once more the bride the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost. But of course the word bride will be repudiated as it was in that first age. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I SAY TODAY LET'S STAND UP. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; STAND UP FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS. STAND up for truth. Stand up for that which is [music] which is glorious. You're not a commoner. He's made you a princess. &gt;&gt; You're not you're you're not you're not you're not one of those that Amen. Uh uh that self-proclaimed. No. God's come to you. God has has has given his his bride that. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my. Brother Bram talked about uh Abraham Lincoln being born for such a time as that. [music] Lincoln standing out there, you know, he had lost he'd lost election after election and he had done this and that, man. Amen. And there he was. He won the election to be president. Hallelujah. But God had God had raised him up for that. And he he comes out off that ship there in New Orleans, I believe it was. and and uh uh and and and and he and he and he looked there and he seen that slave pit and he and and and uh he seen the auctioneers uh auctioning off those slaves. Amen. And and and and there they were. [music] And and and Abraham Lincoln pitched his fist like that and said, "That's wrong. And someday I'll hit it if it takes my life." Hallelujah. And then brother Brandon would say this, and I love this. He says, ' Let me tell you, brother, unbelief is of the devil and let me hit it, Lord. I don't care if it cost me my life. &gt;&gt; Amen. What was he doing? He said, just as those auctioneers and those slave owners, Amen, was doing that to the black man, he said, so is unbelief doing that to God's elect. He said, "Let me hit that thing as hard as I can." And I say if that's what God has come to drive that unbelief out of us, drive it out of us. Drive that unbelief out of your mind. Drive it out of your heart. &gt;&gt; Man, is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Man, we're under a banner. &gt;&gt; That great banner, that great emblem, that great that great uh uh symbol of victory. IT'S FOREVER PAID FOR. &gt;&gt; YES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And God sends a prophet in this day [music] to say, "You're the woman. Maturity has come. I'm going to show you why you're [music] redeemed and what you're redeemed for. Greatest battle ever fought." Brother Brandham would say, "The great hour of charge is at hand." Hallelujah. Soldiers with armors gleaming, colors streaming, faith and doubt is setting yourself in a raid in this tabernacle this morning. Doubt is on one side, faith is on the other. Soldier standed your post of duty. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our captain, the morning star, leads on. He never goes back. He never don't know the word retreat. He don't have to retreat. Amen. Certainly the greatest battle ever fought. She is going on right in here right now. Yes, sir. Between life and death, between sickness and hell, between faith and doubt. Oh my. Between liberty and bondage, the battle is on. Shine your spirit, soldiers. Polish up the armor. God is sending his soldiers. Getting his soldiers ready. He anoints his army. Can I hear a great big amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The completion is here. Amen. The completion is here. As I as I said, amen before it all come until that perfection come. We've had these others [music] until that perfection come. But with that perfect word is perfect faith. &gt;&gt; Keep in that message, folks. Keep in that message. [music] Stay in. Keep your head in that word. Oh, I want to I want to keep seeing myself not in the mirror of condemnation, not in the mirror of religiosity. I want to see myself in the eyes through the eyes of that one who paid for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's come to claim me. He claimed me. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT A PREACHER THINKS ABOUT ME. It don't matter what what what a what a mayor or a president thinks about me. IT DON'T MATTER WHAT ANYONE THINKS ABOUT ME. HE'S THE ONE WHO paid for me. &gt;&gt; He paid for me.

[applause] You know, you don't ever question even in my teenage years, even when when I thought my thought I was smarter than my dad and mom. [music] I never questioned my dad's love. Mom and dad loved me. You kids should never question your your mom and dad's love. Even when you're being idiots, you should never question your dad's [music] love. None of it. Because children are children. But as you begin to grow and mature, [music] and maturity is not being able to grow a mustache, that's that's [music] not which that's good for some of y'all. I remember when I was I was a kid, I was I was already growing me a little mustache. [music] I was 14 and I was I was proud of it. I was shaving already. I've been shaving since I was 12. And so I'd already got me a little bit of a mustache and [music] and uh so there's my my buddy. He was he had never shaven, but he had a little peach fuzz. So we were standing one day and so someone was making fun of him. You know, man, [music] you need to shave that thing that the little peach fuzz off and he said, "It took me 14 years to grow this." Anyways, that don't make that don't make [music] you mature. But as as you begin to grow, you begin to [music] not question mom and dad so much and you begin to think, you know what, they've got a point here and then you start asking them to teach you. Amen. Any of you kids in the teaching stage, y'all y'all in your Are you still in the My dad's dumb? Amen. Hallelujah. And when it comes to us and God, God's got a church here that's not looking at him as if he's dumb, as if his Bible is archaic, as if. But the bride has come to a point where we really love God and love his word and love his messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that is the greatest thing and we hold it to our hearts so dear. Amen. So, as we leave this place today, I just say, let's just simply say, Lord, I'm going to trust you and believe you more than I've ever done it before. &gt;&gt; I don't care what my mind is saying. [music] I don't care what this does or that does. I'm going to cling to that word. &gt;&gt; Well, how about it? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] God bless you. We love you all here this morning.

Well, what are we going to sing as we as as we get ready to go? Listen, God doesn't send that without without a re when when when God sends a messenger to a generation [music] as he has done in this age. Listen, he's it's for a reason. It's to bring that finality. I'm going to wash them with the washing of the water by the word. For there is a [music] bride that I'm going to open and unveil myself to. &gt;&gt; Right? What? What are you? Oh child, you are [singing and music] part of me and I'll not rest. You are [music] at my side. I will do all [music and singing] that you ask of me. You're a jewel in my eyes. &gt;&gt; Virtuous woman, you are my bride. I left a barren land. Searching [singing] for rest, [music] stumbling round in amnesia, bitterness [singing and music] and distress. But then I met a kinsman redeemer who's called the mighty one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I love that song. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Fear, [music] &gt;&gt; you are part of me. I'll not drag. You are at my side.
