think [Applause] the brightest [Music] all things are ready now [Music] the evening time is here foreign [Applause] go ahead and take your Bibles we'll turn to Deuteronomy chapter 30. [Music] Deuteronomy chapter 30 and we'll be starting at verse 15. see I have set before thee this day life and good and death and Evil and then I command me thee this day to love the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to keep his Commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in the land wither thou goest to possess it but if thine heart turn away so that thou Wilt not hear but shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them I denounce unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and thee shall not prolong your days upon the land wither thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live and let's turn to Joshua chapter 24. Joshua chapter 24 and starting at verse 14. now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and in truth and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father serve that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites and whose lands ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord let's go ahead and pray Lord Jesus we come into your presence Lord we thank you for being here Lord Jesus we thank you for your presence Lord I pray that you would just take control of this remaining part of the service Lord that Lord you would allow me to to say what you've put on My Heart Lord that it would just say that I would just say what's pleasing to you Lord that you would stop me from saying anything that that you wouldn't want said Lord and Lord may it just minister to the to the hearts of the people Lord may it meet the needs Lord right Lord we pray that you would just be be the one that's honored in the remainder of the service Lord we just surrender to you Lord and commit the service into your hands in the name Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen you may all be seated in the sermon leadership brother Branham said what do you look like what are you following what have we done you must choose your leader choose today you choose life or death your choice will determine your Eternal destination what you choose remember Jesus said follow me and you're invited tonight to do so and to follow him to eternal life you must come on his term that's right the word not upon the Creed not upon the public opinion not upon what anybody else thinks about it but on what God said about it I'm going to talk tonight a little bit about choices now a choice is an act of selecting or making a decision when faced with two or more possibilities and we all know that we make choices throughout our day we make lots of choices throughout our day in fact I went online and just decided okay let's Google let's find out how many choices does the average person make in a single day and this is fully at least they call them semi-conscious choices so these are where you're making some sort of decision this isn't an unconscious choice but this is Summit conscious you at least have to put the slightest hint of thought into it and we're going to go ahead and start with the kids actually so Haven how many choices do you think you probably make per day guess a number you're gonna say 200. okay that's perfectly good guess lynnae how many do you think 20 okay Eliana how many choices do you think you make a day over a hundred okay charity how about you how many choices do you think you make a day two thousand okay she's a busy girl send me how many choices do you think you make a day 10 he lives a very simple life this is this is a good life here Aaron how many choices do you think you make a day 600 okay Paul how about you come on everybody else is at a number you got to give me a number here what do you think 30 Okay so we've got numbers ranging from 10 to 2000 I think you said charity as the number of choices that that a child will make in a day um according to studies uh they figure that most children make approximately three thousand choices in a day um now for adults how many choices do we think we then the average adult you know I'll give business owners higher than this probably but you know average adult how many choices are we making in a day um brother Joe will let you throw a number out 8 000 okay brother Merle how many do you think [Laughter] he said eight thousand five thousand okay sister Amy how many do you think six thousand okay sister Keys how many do you think yes full participation here nine thousand all right brother Ken how about you ten thousand okay where everybody keeps going no I make more than that I make more than that all right let's go a little bit higher Robert how many do you think 6 500. all right so the I'm I'm gonna put this one out there first because I just think it's interesting most adults we make approximately just decisions about food alone 227 decisions per day about food alone the average adult just food no other topic over 200 times we are making decisions about food now we'll extrapolate this out the average adult according to studies that are put together by Cornell University and different ones say that the average adult makes 35 000 decisions in a day now obviously as your level of responsibility increases so does the as they say Smorgasbord of choices that you're faced with you know business owners and those that are managing or those kind of things are probably making even more choices because they have to to deal with all these other things that are going on and these are all things that are you know just remotely conscious decisions you may not have had to put a ton of thought into it but you had to think about it for at least the briefest moment to make am I choosing Choice a or Choice B or C or D or extrapolate it out but um you know obviously each decision carries consequences that can be both good and bad and a lot of times your decision has both good and bad from it when you start to to go through it there's there's going to be good and bad there's going to be ramifications that come from from every choice every decision that we make on it let's turn to Proverbs chapter 4. Proverbs chapter 4 and verse 23. keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life you know for a lot of these things we'll talk about that we make choices and like I said we're talking about conscious choices so we're putting some sort of thought into it so everyone will go well this is affected by by your brain this is affected by your decision making but even all of your decision making is affected by where your heart's at for out of it are the issues of life so keep thy heart with all diligence your your heart where you are at your core is actually affecting every one of these decisions in some way because it's changing the motives that you have it's changing what's actually important you know you can take the most basic choice but different motives will make a different Choice even if it's the simplest thing that you come down to brother Brandon said in the sermon Redeemer Redemption he said that's where every man has to come to in life sometime is make a decision you have to make a choice you got to make a choice whether he was going to have an education or not you had to make a choice who was going to be your wife you had to there had to be decisions and choices made in life and this may be the night that you'll have your final call to make your choice whom you're going to serve in a sermon leadership in 1965 he says but you have a choice you can do it or not do it you can say I don't want to so you have a choice after a while you have a choice of what girl you're going to marry what boy you're going to marry you have a choice everywhere in life then you've got a choice again to whether you want to live after this life or just be a good popular person a movie star or a dancer or something each one of us has to make a choice and it's confronted to us but we're all confronted with this one thing what are we going to do about eternal life we're going to live Hereafter or not then we have to come to Jesus to get that that opportunity of choosing that's the one thing God gave us he don't force nothing on us he just lets us make our own choice so you have to not be forced but just make your own choice and again in the Kinsmen Redeemer in 1960 brother Branham says but oh how I like that little Ruth she had to make a decision I had to make a decision you've got to make a decision You'll Never Walk out of these doors this morning without some kind of a decision you'll not leave this room today either being a better man or woman or a worse man or woman to reject it you'll be worse it'll be harder the next time for you to get to it or you'll go out better it comes to a showdown in her life it comes to a showdown in everybody's life and Ruth had to make a decision so the Bible said that her mother-in-law told her go back to your Gods like your sister did go back like the lukewarm did why don't you go on back the gospel preacher if you want to go go on the real truthful preacher that'll put it before a class of people you make your decision you stand on your feet lukewarm wishy-washy in and out won't say that but a real servant of God will lay it on your lap make your decision Ruth said I'll go where you go your people will be my people your God will be my God where you live I live where you die I'll die and where you're buried I'll be buried that's the real decision so we all know that the most important choice that we can make is whether or not we'll accept Christ as our Lord and savior all of us have made that choice which is why we're here in this building right now Choice after Choice after choice in our walk with Christ it isn't I made that one choice and I never have to think about it again I never have to make another Choice it was do you keep having more things coming up the devil decides okay now I can really throw the questions at you now I can really throw everything at you you know every time that we make choices as I mentioned earlier you have both the good and the bad that come from it often at the same time you know looking at it from the natural for a moment if we're making what most people would classify as a good choice I'm going to choose to maintain a healthy diet and exercise there are still consequences that come from that choice you know I have obviously the positives I'm gonna it's gonna be good for me and helping me to stay fit and healthy and I'm probably going to be able to to live longer and all these kind of different things but it also does have the negative consequence of it's going to restrict how much I can enjoy some of my favorite junk Foods it's going to restrict how much I can enjoy doing certain activities or doing these kind of things because I have to focus time and energy on making sure that I'm staying healthy that's not bad necessarily but they're still both a positive and a negative from this Choice most people would look at and say that's a good choice you've made they're still negative that comes from it you still have to look at both sides when you make the choice you know this is one where um you know choosing to partake in illegal drugs there's the positive it gives you enjoyment for a short time brother Joe am I correct in saying that for a short time you have enjoyment of some sort there is some sort of pleasure that comes from it but then there's also negatives that come from it brother Joe what would be some of the negatives yes I'm picking on you tonight sorry what are what just everything okay just everything that goes out there so uh you know you have negatives come from how it affects your body you have negatives that come from uh that you can get on the wrong side of the law there's negatives that come from uh the cost that it is from from a financial standpoint and all these different things so yes there's what could be classified as a positive I get momentary enjoyment from it but there's also all these negatives that go with it you know telling a lie can sometimes get you out of a situation and possibly even prevent you from getting in trouble I'm sure all you kids know about this we go hey if I tell mom or dad this lie I can keep from being in trouble this is a positive this is a good thing I do not have to be in trouble for breaking mom's vase I can lie it wasn't me it was the doc it was the cat it was the whatever but it wasn't me but then you have the negatives from it where you can when it's finally found out because the truth always eventually comes out it can damage the person's faith and trust that they've begun to put in you you know if you lie to your parents they've begun to feel like okay I can Eliana I can trust you I can trust you to handle this trust you to handle that and then you get caught in a lie and now mom's going maybe I can't trust Iliana quite as much as I did maybe I can't trust charity quite as much as I thought that I could yeah so there's what we feel like is a positive I'm protecting myself from being in trouble there's also this negative that comes with it you know for uh for our electricians in the group there are when you choose to study and pass the test to become a journeyman electrician there are positives this allows you to be able to to make more money this allows you to be able to probably have more seniority this allows you to be able to uh do more do different types of work and have a better career path but at the same time by making the decision to put your time and effort into this you're at the same time deciding not to go this career route not to go that route now that's not anything necessarily bad for that but that is some of the consequence you've taken the time to dedicate to this is what I want to do I want to do this to be a journeyman an electrician well that means you're probably not studying to be a fast food manager you're probably not studying to run a restaurant you're not probably not studying to do this every single one of the choices that we make throughout life in the natural you can look at and go okay here's positive and here's negative that comes from it and each one of us are continually making the decisions and weighing it out on okay does the positive outweigh the negative is this what I where I want to go is this the better or worse you know we talked about the illegal drug side here's the small positive here's the big negatives so it's probably a bad decision I probably don't want to do this you know the eating healthy and do and and exercising doing all this okay here's the positives here's the negative right the positives probably outweigh the negative so it's probably a good decision obviously it's not what I'm making but it would be a good decision if I did make it every choice that we make will affect us now like we said we know that the most important decision that we make is to follow Christ we make that first step we make that first decision that okay he's going to be my Lord and Savior but then we keep making decisions we keep making decisions to go can't am I truly going to fully trust him am I truly going to accept every word that he's laid out am I truly going to give my all into this and it's something we weigh out back and forth through our life because you're going can I fully trust him or do I need to keep some of this on my plate do I need to try to handle some of this brother Branham said in the sermon blind Bartimaeus he says bless you my brother that's fine right now you've got to make a decision you can't go out that door the same person you're in the presence of God you'll either go out that door a better man or woman or worse by rejecting this might be the last time you'll ever reject it it might be I hope not but it may be but now while he's knocking and giving one more if you feel something at your heart saying yes you ought to raise your hand and accept me you know why in the sermon God of this evil age brother Branham said the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses or five senses rather the Inside Man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscience and love and so forth the outside man see feel taste smell here but the inside of that spirit is a soul and is controlled by one thing your free will you can accept what the devil says or accept What God Says and that'll determine what spirit is in there if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God and it won't feed on anything of the world Jesus said if you love the world or the things of the world it's because the love of God has not even entered the inner part Satan has deceived you and man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God brother Brandon told the story where he was talking to the the Indian Chief and the Indian chief was describing to him how well inside there's a white dog and a black dog that are fighting and brother Brandon said okay so which one wins well whichever one I feed the most so he was saying as a Christian because he had already accepted Christ this was one of brother branham's converts and he was but he was still saying that nature is still there and brother random talked about that that flesh nature is still there trying to raise back up it's trying to grab control it's trying to to take over and so we constantly have that that choice that that wrestling back and forth between which way are we going to go now this isn't changing our Salvation this isn't saying if you make the bad choice today you're lost I heard uh brother Merle talk about the uh you know once saved always saved um and I'm gonna go on those yes if if saved then always saved that's that's the way I like the phrase it is if you were once saved then you're always saved that's the If part that's between you and God to figure out but you have that white dog and black dog that are fighting within you and so you're constantly making the choice of what am I feeding on what am I taking in what am I consuming which one am I giving it to am I allowing myself to go into a state of mind where I'm focusing more on things of the world I'm focusing more on the worldly entertainments and oh man the newest Marvel movie came out I need to binge all of them so I can keep up on the storyline and I'm going to dedicate this many hours to the next thing so that way I know what's going on and now the black dog's getting stronger and stronger and stronger or am I going okay you know what I'm gonna actually take all the time today and I'm going to listen to an entire brother Branham sermon today not just the 20 minutes in the car as I drive to job but I'm actually going to sit down and listen to the entire sermon I'm not saying you have to listen to one of the six hour sermons but you know when I'm gonna listen to one of the two-hour sermons I'm gonna put it I'm gonna give that much time to make sure that I'm feeding the right dog and I have to keep making those decisions this isn't a one-time thing of great I'm done this is what I'm doing but it's a constant decision over and over and over now we can build that into a habit a habit comes from constantly making the same Choice over and over and over to where it now becomes easy to make the choice because it's built into your routine I always tell my wife that I admire her for the fact that she is so good about making sure that every morning she gets up and she has her devotion time with the Lord and she has time to exercise every morning this is what and most mornings she gets all this done before the kids get up and it throws her day into a tizzy if the kids get up before she's done because she wants this is her quiet time in the morning she gets to do her devotion with no one pulling on her no one yelling Mama it's just her and the Lord and then she does her exercise time so she's gotten everything set and then she's ready to face the day and this is part of her normal routine it's something she does on a daily basis she doesn't even have to think about it anymore she gets up and the first thing she does is roll into this unless it's a weird day where she overslept and it's a struggle but in general this is the normal every day we get up and we do these things and then after that's her cup of coffee get these two done and then we move on to the coffee has the energy to keep going but she has this discipline down because she's made the choice over and over and over and over to where now it's just normal she doesn't have to wake up and go what am I going to do this morning she wakes up and she starts her routine because this is what she does how many of us working guys that we wake up and immediately start our routine to get ready for the day whether that's devotion time whether that's just getting your clothes ready and getting ready to go to work you have your routine and particularly when you're going to work and you've got a job probably starts at this time I've got to do this through this you've got this routine that's built in and you don't have to think about it you get up and you do this because these are the choices that you've made over and over and over now anytime you start a new job you have to rebuild this unless it happens to be a job where it's starting the exact same time and all these kind of things but in general you start a new career I know brother Robert started working at a bank not that long ago and so he had to build a new routine okay this is how my morning goes I get up at this time I do these things I leave to go to work whatever that routine looks like and then he has to make that choice every day over and over and over until it becomes something that he's almost not thinking about anymore because it is the normal it is what he does every single day there are people that look at the fact that we go to church twice on Sundays and we go to church on Wednesdays and they go how do you have time yeah how do you do this how do you do that and we're like when we don't have church on Sunday night we don't know what to do with ourselves it's like what do we do now there's service is dismissed in the afternoon what's happening what are we going what where are we going what's doing it you know we don't know what restaurants are really open we don't know what stores are open because we don't do anything on Sundays we go to church because this is our normal we've made the decision over and over and over to go I'm gonna be at church the whole day I'm gonna be at church Wednesday night I may be rushing I may be rolling in right as the pastor's coming up to preach but I'm going to be there because that's the decision that we've made to where now this is fully a habit this is a choice that we've made over and over and over so that it begins to become habit but until you have habits established those choices can be a struggle those choices can be so hard to make sometimes and those are the ones that Satan will attack the most are those decisions when you're trying to make the choice and you're trying to start this good thing going in your life you're trying to go you know I had conviction while I was at church and I know I'm just going to go ahead and be open and vulnerable here for a moment I have always struggled with being fully consistent on having a nighttime devotion time with my family it's it's like we get through dinner and then we're rushing around getting everything cleaned up getting kids ready for bed I've always had an early morning job so I want to get a bed at a decent hour so I can get enough sleep so I can do this so I can do that and it's it's so easy for that to begin to slip off and I'll have a sermon we'll go through some services or things where I'll really get it on me okay I've got to get better at this I've got to make sure that we're doing this and in some ways it's almost become a laughing in my family because I'll go all right we're getting to devotion night and my daughter will be like how long is it going to last you know in three in two three days she's going so Daddy are we still doing devotion tonight or can I go to my room are we still doing this or that and she's not the only one all my kids will do the same thing and they'll kind of be picking at me are you gonna be able to do it are we gonna stick with it are we gonna make sure you know how does devotion work on Wednesday night we're already going to church what does devotion look like parrot Church all day on Sunday what does devotion look like on Sunday I don't know I've never figured out Sunday and Wednesday it doesn't quite clicken me and this is one of the areas that I know I struggle as a father and I struggle as a husband going how do I lead this well with my family how do I do this well to ensure that my kids know hey this is important and I know part of my struggle comes from the fact my family growing up wasn't great at this now I will be the first to say my mom was great at the devotion she built it into our school every morning I had devotion my mom led us in devotion we had morning where we'd read scriptures we would listen to however long of a message um it was either 15 or 20 minutes something like that and we'd normally do a message in a week maybe two weeks but we'd constantly this was part of our school work 8 A.M in the school room starting devotion first thing you did for school every morning there was consistency we knew it was going to happen that didn't happen with a family devotion and so when I became a dad became an adult that's just been an area that I've always struggled with now I can sit down I can talk with my family about stuff I can answer questions but to sit down and actually do a full devotion it's just one of my areas that I figure out I don't know how many other dads struggle with that but that's mine I'll be glad to commiserate a little bit maybe you can share ideas on how to do better but I've had that's a choice that I struggle to begin to set the habit when after those really good services or after I've had that time with the Lord going I've got to get better at this and you begin to make that choice okay we're doing it tonight okay we're doing it tonight and then you have the night come up where everything was weird and I worked extra late because of meetings and when I got home my wife had had an awful day and so we were behind on everything and so I'm trying to help her get the house back in order get the kids cleaned up get whatever done and then the day's gone and it didn't happen and somewhere in there I missed making the right choice and sometimes it's even hard to look back to go I don't even know where I would have made the choice but somewhere I missed it somewhere I missed making the right right choice it doesn't mean that I made bad choices I wasn't leaving my family to go out and drink or go to do this or go to do that none of the things that I did were bad but I still allowed myself to be distracted and so I didn't make the better choice I made choices throughout the evening I made choices to go my wife's stressed I need to step in and help with dishes help with wrangling Silas for a while so she can have a little bit of time or doing whatever I made choices but then at the end of the night I'm looking back going did I make the best choice or should there have been a different choice where I went even if it was just to go hey 10 minutes y'all sit down there are things to be done it's not gonna be more than that but 10 minutes read a scripture pray we're done maybe it's gonna be less than ten but at least we've still kept it going but I look back and go I didn't make that choice I allowed myself to be distracted and focused on other choices that needed to be made other decisions that needed to be made and so throughout our life we keep having these choices come up and that one was easy for me to harp on because it's all about me I don't know what the choices are in your life that you're continually going back and forth with but each one of us has these places where Satan goes hey this is the place the armor is not quite as tight the armors need still needs to be buckled a little bit more let me keep throwing in something to mess with this choice that they're making to mess with this decision and it doesn't mean that you're making a bad decision it doesn't mean that you're going off and sinning now maybe you are maybe that's the choice you're making maybe you're going into something that's wrong but that's not always the way Satan attacks us a lot of times he'll have you keep making the choice that just keeps you busy that just keeps you focused on other things that just keeps you distracted we're still making choices but he's preventing you from making the choices often enough to build the Habit to where you don't even have to think about it anymore like I said my wife can do that with her devotions every morning she almost doesn't have to think about it it's just part of her day I wish the night devotions for us that I had made the decisions where it was that easy that we didn't even have to think about it that we just rolled in it happened and we kept going and each one of us has those types of things in our life where we have some things that we've built into habits because we've made the choice over and over and over and we have other things that are constant struggle because we haven't made the choice over and over in Joshua chapter 2 we have the story of Rahab and brother Branham talks about about rahabi talks about a little bit in the sermon God's wrapped gift in 1960 he says Rahab the Harlot that we're all familiar with she being a young girl was turned on the street by a heathen father and mother that put her on the street because she was beautiful and was to bring in income to them on prostitution and get down in this immoral girl that was turned on the street she had heard there was a God who answered prayer and the first opportunity that she got to accept that God or do something for him she did it and God spared her life and saved her father and mother and her family she fell in love with a general in the army of Israel we find in history and married this General and their courtship was wonderful and finally they settled down and lived in Bethlehem now some of the ways that the way brother Brandon presents it some of this was outside her realm of choices someone else made a choice that affected her she was turned out by her parents to have this way as her way of making a living that was a choice she didn't make now at some point it became her choice at some point she continued the path she continued making that decision so it may not have started out as her choice but eventually it became her choice but at the same time she's going through this she's she's making these choices she begins to hear about the God of Israel The God Who answers prayer the God who destroyed Egypt The God Who split the Red Sea The God Who split the Jordan River she begins to hear these stories and she begins to to know that there's something different here this isn't the same kind of tales that she's heard about the false gods that are around there these are about there's something more real about this and something that I found interesting about this story when I actually took the time to think about and study about it here you have a woman that is you know living the life of a harlot this is her job her income so no one would think the slightest bit about two strange men coming into her house that would not raise a red flag anywhere great two more guys showed up the neighbors are complaining because of the type of business she has but they're not getting wondering who are these two men where did they come from why are they here they think they know all those answers already and so here you have what was actually the perfect cover for them to come into this house because it wouldn't immediately raise red flags it wouldn't immediately cause alarm to have two strange men come into rahab's house but then you have Rahab who now she has her first real major choice she can choose to turn them over she can turn choose to to give them over to uh the officials of the city and let them know that these are spies come in or she can make the choice to side with the god of Israel and so Rahab makes her choice she goes and she hides them when people come to question her about the two men she says I didn't know where they went but I do know that they left they were going out and you know I didn't know that they were spies that were here you know all this kind of stuff and she gives them cover she hides them under the Flax on the roof and then she talks to them and she goes I saved your life you owe me mine you owe me mine and my families we've heard about everything with the god of Israel we've heard of everything he can do and I just want to live this is all I'm going for I want me and my family to live and she makes her decision she makes her choice and this would have been such a hard choice because this was brand new this was not a habit she was used to making this was not a choice that had been developed over and over and over this was going against everything she had ever learned ever been taught everything she'd ever experienced she was used to men that wouldn't keep their word to her she was used to men that would come in give her money and leave there were no promises there was no hope for a better life there was nothing and yet now she was going to take these two men complete strangers and she was going to take them at their word she was going to accept that they would be actually thinking about what was best for her that they would actually be willing to stand up for her and protect her when she had had a life of men shoving her to the side shoving her down not receiving any of the protection that she should have had she had had a father that sent her out to be a working girl like this the man that should have protected her that should have kept her safe was the same one that sent her into this life and yet now she has these two men and she accepts their word I'll let you out the window and I'm gonna believe your word that my family and I will be safe this wasn't an easy choice this wasn't something that you know hey it's nice we read through the story wow Rahab was so great she made this choice to protect them this was not an easy Choice when you start to break it down and boil it down this was not simple as she watched those two men flee slide down the Rope disappear into the night I guarantee she was thinking they'll never be back because she had had man after man that had did that throughout her life that had told her something that had made her a promise and then never kept it but yet she was willing to make the choice and go no this is what I'm gonna do I've heard about this God and if these two men are representing that God I can make this choice I can make this decision this can be different it wasn't an easy choice but she made it and then her life did change because she became one of the Blessed women she was within the lineage of Jesus Christ she got to come from this place of being basically the lowest of the low to where she now Becomes of one of those you talk about is she was in this line she was in the line of David in the line of Jesus this is what she became elevated to this is what because she made a choice and it wasn't an easy choice in Genesis chapter 25 we have Jacob and Esau and we're going to jump in on verse 29 in chapter Genesis chapter 25 verse 29. and Jacob sod pottage and Esau came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee with that same red podage fry my faint therefore was his name called Edom and Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright and Esau said behold I'm at the point to die and what prophet shall this Birthright do to me and Jacob said swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils and he did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way thus Esau despised his Birthright both of these men had their choices and this was one of those pivotal moments in them where their choice came down Jacob wanted the birthright Esau being the oldest had the birthright but Jacob wanted it he wanted to be the one who the family name went down through he wanted to be the one who uh everything funneled through he wanted to be the one that represented the family he won he had heard about Father Abraham her grandfather Abraham and everything that it that had happened and how God had called him and how he had walked through the land and all these kind of things and he wanted to be the one but Esau had the title Esau had the claim because Esau was the firstborn and it came down and Jacob says sell me your Birthright now Esau could have gotten up and walked to the next tent over and said hey Mom I'm hungry or hey Dad I'm hungry or hey servants I'm hungry and then waited for them to cook some food he could have but Esau made the choice that what's this Birthright worth great it's a great title I have the birthright yay he didn't care and so he made the choice that it wasn't worth anything so great the food that I'm going to enjoy right now that's what I need I need the strength right this moment why should I have to wait the birthright all it does is get me blessings after Dad dies who knows how long that's gonna be or I can eat the food right now he made the choice of this is what's valuable now and Jacob made the choice of this is what I want I'm willing to work fight deceive lie steal whatever as long as I get that this is everything and so God would look down and go Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated not because he made them make their decisions as we know it's not a predestination comes from for knowledge brother Brandon talked about that that it isn't that God predestinate predestined you and made you make the choices but God foreknew he knew what your choices would be so he could predestinate where you would end up because he knew what your choices would be for knowledge brought about predestination because God could foreknow it all so God could look down at these two that hadn't even been born yet and know their decisions not because he forced them to make decisions not because he was sitting there like puppets on a string making them do everything but because he knew what their decisions would be he knew what their choices would be he could give the foreknowledge to go Jacob if I loved Esau have I hated brother Brandon said in the sermon by faith Moses he says by faith raise your eyes and look to him who said defile this body and I will destroy it by faith we believe those things it's nothing that you've seen it's something you believe by faith Moses did and in this Faith walk there Comes A Time there has to be a choice lot made that sad mistake when he that we make a lot of times we choose for our own good we choose things that would be better sometime if there's a little squabble comes in the church and someone would say well the Deacon or the pastor is on this side don't look at that look at what's righteous get that thing out and bring them both together that's Godly there's a choosing and if we choose for ourself we choose something that's for our own good but Moses chose the afflictions and the disgrace that he might walk with the people of God think of it now listen to it chose the afflictions of the people of God and counted it a great treasure for he endured seeing him who was invisibly but the window read this scripture earlier this morning Hebrews chapter 11 starting at verse 24. by faith Moses when he had come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible Esau had made the same kind of choice that brother Brandon describes in that quote he says a lot of times we choose for our own good we choose what we think is best we choose what will feel best we choose what we think is going to be best for us in the moment brother random described a lot as making that same Choice Abraham tells him pick the land where you go I'll go the other direction if you go right I'll go left if you go forward I'll go backward South North whatever you pick and so lot picked the fertile region to go there's everything here this is where I'll be able to be wealthy be comfortable that's where I'm going he focused on what would physically make him the happiest would make him be able to enjoy it the most and yet here we have Moses that makes the opposite choice Moses had everything his brother Wendell described this morning he had it all he had the silver spoon in his mouth he was next in line to Pharaoh all he had to do was be patient Pharaoh dies he takes over and I can free the slaves and still have everything that seems like the Easy Choice because now I get to free the slaves and I get to enjoy the wealth there's no downside here sept that it wouldn't be serving God it wouldn't be doing it the way God wanted it done and so Moses was willing to forsake it all he was rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season he made the choice that it was better to be with the people of God like I said from an outside if I was just to present this as okay what would be the logical game plan of how you would handle this waiting 15 20 years for pharaoh to die and then I have it all and I can free the slaves because they're mine to free seems like the better choice if we were putting this out just as here this is the business you're going to develop you're second in line to the the owner now he doesn't treat his employees well he yells and cusses a lot he treats everybody like dirt but if you just hold on it'll be yours and then you can treat the employees well you can do this you can do that to put it in modern day terms we're throwing this out here it's like you just have to hold on you know don't don't Buck the the boss too much you know probably shouldn't correct him when he's cursing you know if he's really laying into somebody probably shouldn't get in between them but if you just lay low until he retires or dies the business is yours but yet Moses was willing to make the choice to go hey I'm willing to be fired in the modern terms to go no we can't do this we can't treat our employees this way we can't do this we can't do that I'm willing to stand up to the boss and be fired Moses was willing to throw in with God's people and be banished from the land and lose everything because he esteemed it Greater he esteemed it better to be with the people of God that was the choice he made and ultimately if we go back that was the choice that Jacob was making Jay was going the reason I want the birthright is because God chose this line if I'm at the Forefront of that he made Abraham This Promise so if I have the birthright I become part of that promise because I'm now part of that seed going down I'm part of that direct seed line as long as Esau has the birthright he's part of that I'm off to the side but I want to be right there at the Forefront I want to be the one who's getting this promise because I'm sure they had heard passed down from Dad about what grandpa had received as a promise from God they had heard this story but Esau didn't put the value on it he made the choice of I want to build up my own I want to have my own enjoyment and just become rich on my own and show what a powerful man I am and all Jacob wanted was I want to be part of that what Abraham was looking towards I want to be part of that line I want to be part of that promise and so that Birthright is everything that's what I'm looking for that's what I want to be part of John chapter 8. John chapter 8. and we're starting at the beginning of the chapter here it's Jesus went into the Mount of Olives went unto the Mount of Olives and early in the morning he came again into the temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them and the scribes and Pharisees brought on him a woman taken in adultery and when they had set her in the midst they say unto him Master this woman has taken an adultery in the very act now Moses and the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou I'm going to pause a second Leviticus chapter 20. and verse 10. you don't need to turn there if Sister Keys just wants to put it up for everybody because we're going right back to John but Leviticus chapter 20 and verse 10. and the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife even he that committeth adultery with his neighbor's wife the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death now back to John chapter 8 verse five again now Moses and the law commanded us that such should be stoned but what sayest thou this they said tempting him that they might have to accuse him but Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not all right the scribes and the Pharisees brought this woman first problem we have these are men that are students of the scripture these are men that I don't know which sect it was but at least one of them they were supposed to be able to have a scroll rolled up close put a pin through it and then name every word that the pin struck they should know the word that well you can't tell me they didn't know the entire commandment of Moses that it was the man and the woman should be stoned but yet somehow only the woman here ends up here in front of Jesus where's the guy they said they caught her in the very Act so there were two people involved they caught him they only brought her now I don't know what This Woman's story is brother Branham gave us more history about Rahab than what the scriptures say as a prophet he could tell us that I can't find anywhere where he gave us more history about this woman so I don't know if her story is anything like rahabs but I know that her life was a series of choices there were choices that kept being made throughout her life that brought her into this situation I'm sure there was mixture I'm sure she made good some good choices in life there was there wasn't I can't I'm not going to say that every single Choice she ever made was bad but obviously there were a lot of bad choices because she's now in this spot and somehow she made a choice that put her with a man that describes and the Pharisees didn't want to tangle with now we can try to Imagine This you know to me when I imagine it and I'm this is not in scripture so you all can throw this out if you want but my immediate thought is it was one of the scribes and Pharisees that was involved it's one of the guys and then this girl wanted him divorce his wife and be with her and he said that's not happening so I just need you killed and out of the way so this is how we're going to do it and while we're at it I'm going to take out Jesus as well I'm going to take we're gonna do two birds with one stone it's going to be great and so they bring the woman to Jesus to get a reaction they want something that they can work with throw the woman down in front of him and he promptly ignores them and it's just scribbling in the sand and they keep asking they keep pushing him and so finally he stands up he looks up at him and says whoever is without sin you throw the first stone and then he goes right back to drawing in the dirt he goes back to ignoring them you're not worth me paying attention to it's not going to help for me to listen to you yell it's not going to help for me to respond so all I'm going to do is tell you whoever's without sin throw the first stone and he goes down and he's drawing in the dirt and there are plenty of people that like to say well we think he was riding their sins out in the dirt maybe he was I can't tell you that because it's not in the Bible but he was God so he very easily could have been writing out every one of their sins in front of them oh yeah you've you've got a temper oh you're an adulterer oh you're a liar oh you're this you're that whether it was him riding it into the dirt or whether it was just conviction falling on them each one of them drops their Stone and walks away now I don't know what choices had brought this woman to this point but now she was at the same place where she now got to make a choice and so Jesus goes to her and he asks her where are your accusers who's condemned you and she says no man and Jesus looks at her and he says then neither do I condemn thee and this is where her choice comes in he says go and sin no more the same kind of way that we I talked about Rahab how she had never really had the man that she could trust and yet somehow she made the choice to trust these two men this woman is probably in a very similar place she's in the adultery position she's not the wonderful wife that a man was willing to fully commit to and do all these things she's the outcast she's the one everybody wants to kill and yet now here's this man who somehow has convinced everyone to leave whether she caught everything that he said in the midst of the yelling back and forth I don't know she may have been crying she may have been solving she may not have caught what he said she may not know what's going on except now they're gone and this man is looking at her and saying neither do I condemn you I don't look down upon you I don't think that you're anything less and I'm just going to tell you go and sin no more make the choice from this point to be different make the choice now to go forward in a different way make the choice to make a fresh start this was her moment to make her choice and the scripture doesn't tell us what she does we don't get to know but what we do know is she had an encounter with Jesus continuing to go through this process of sanctification we keep having these encounters with Christ and when we do we get to make that choice as brother Branham said in a quote that I read earlier you don't get to leave the same you either make the choice to leave better or you make the choice to reject and leave worse but it's still your choice if you reject it's harder the next time and I don't think that only applies to your salvation decision I think that applies to every single the ones you're struggling with if God's putting conviction on you for something and you pull away and walk out the doors rejecting it's going to be harder the next time it doesn't mean you can't overcome it doesn't mean that you'll still if you won't have a breakthrough down the road but it's going to be harder because you didn't respond and so you hardened that heart just a little bit now God can still get through and that's where I still apply this isn't just for that first decision of yes I accept Christ as my savior that's for every time that Christ comes down to meet you and go brother Wendell I want you to walk a little further with me I want you to take that next step I want you to go just a little bit deeper a little little more than we've had before the woman's Choice had brought her to this moment and she was surrounded by people that wanted to crucify her for her choices up to this point but Jesus was able to look past her old choices and give her a new choice that was what she was going to be evaluated on that's what he was putting out there as great you made lots of bad choices but here's your new option this is the choice that I'm going to care about this is the choice that matters and so when God brings us into those moments whether it's here in these Church walls whether it's at our own house whether it's off in the car and he brings us down to that moment and he's starting to minister to you and he gives you this choice he's telling us the same thing of those were your old choices but this is the choice that matters are you going to go a little bit further with me are you going to take those next steps or is it going to be harder or is it going to be more difficult are you going to make that choice but this is the decision that I'm focused on not your old stuff this one Matthew chapter 27 and verse 38. then were there two thieves crucified with him one on the right hand and another on the left both of these thieves had made decisions and choices that led to this point they you know if you actually look through the history it's generally considered that these were not um gentle thieves these were not like the Robin Hood thieves that still from the rich give to the poor we're going to be nice about it we're going to do this these were violent criminals if you look at what historians say about it they're like these were thieves High women killers yes they were killing you to take your stuff they weren't just killing you to kill you but they weren't afraid of the violent side these were not let me make sure there's no one at home and then burgle the house because there's nobody here and it's safe this was I'm gonna get you on the road I'm gonna knock you over the head and if you die oh well at least I still got the money I came for these were these were these were Violent Men and both of them had made these decisions to bring them to this exact same point they had made very similar decisions along the way very similar choices to follow along this violent route and now they were both in the same position on either side of Jesus Christ on the crosses we don't know their exact stories and while I've heard it dramatized a few different ways where they try to give you full background of these thieves and how they ended up on the cross there's one thing that we can definitively say about these two one of these men had a heart that wasn't completely hard yet Luke chapter 23 starting at verse 39 and one of the male factors which were hanged railed on him saying if thou be Christ save thyself and us but the other answering rebuked him saying Dost not thou fear God seeking Thou Art in the same condemnation and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our Deeds but this man hath done nothing amiss and he said unto Jesus Lord remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom and Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise two men their previous decisions having brought them to the exact same point we're faced with one final choice what to do with the Man Called Jesus this is what it came down to this is what their entire lives as awful it has been as many crimes as they had committed as many lives as they had damaged it came down to this one final choice that outweighed everything else they had done what are you going to do with the man named Christ Jesus one man his heart fully hardened didn't care even in that moment all he could think about was let me spit at this person let me yell at them let me do anything to try to make it worse for this guy let me treat him as bad as I can one whose heart wasn't completely hardened and who obviously had heard about Jesus before because otherwise how could he sit there and go this man is innocent he had to have heard something about Jesus I don't know if he had ever been able to listen to Jesus teach I don't know if he'd ever been in that but at the very least had heard about him and he could in that moment sit there and go leave him alone you and I deserve this he doesn't he is innocent he shouldn't be here there was enough left in his heart as hard as it may have gotten there was still enough give in it for him to stand up and go this man doesn't deserve this he shouldn't be here you and I should be every choice we've made every decision has brought us both right here where we should be and then he could look at Jesus Christ and go Lord remember me he didn't ask to be saved he didn't say take us down off the cross prove anything he didn't ask for anything all he said was Lord remember me and when he said Lord remember me that was enough and that one choice of what do you do with Jesus this man was able to now suddenly Jesus looks at him and goes this day this day you'll be with me in Paradise all the evil you've done all that you've done wrong all your life all the violence that you've done you finally made the right choice and that choice outweighs all the rest that choice is the important one because now you made the right decision about what to do with Christ as Christians we've made that decision as Christians we sit here and we've made the decision about what we're going to do with Christ we've accepted him Lord wash us in your blood I want to follow you I want to serve you we surrender Our Lives to him but then we keep having to make choices over and over do we choose to actually follow his word completely or do we choose to go our own way in some ways do we continue to accept the blood of Christ for our sins or do we choose to think that the blood isn't strong enough because we should have known better I think this is one of the ones that Christians struggle with the most to go I should have known better I shouldn't have allowed that to happen I should have known better than to give into that Temptation or to be take part in this sin or to do this and then we want to sit there and go I knew better which means the blood can't do this that's the thought Satan wants to put in your mind you knew better you accepted Christ and then you still did this uh-uh blood's not good enough for that and then we have to sit there and make the choice of do we believe that or do we accept that his blood is strong enough for anything even when I make a mistake even when I come up short the blood is still there and it's still strong enough even for when I knew I shouldn't do that we have to choose which one we're going to accept do we choose to fully surrender to Christ or do we choose to keep a secret room in our heart that's hidden and off limits I'm not quite ready to surrender this yet I'm not quite ready to clean out that room this is where I like to to hide this part of my life or hide this addiction or hide this habit brother random tells a story in the sermon look he says one day A Mother's boy had killed a man he was laying there ready to die and so the little mother stood by the governor's door and finally with one of the guards Governor said Governor that the mother of that boy is out here wants wants you she wants to see you when they opened the door and said Madam he'll receive you the poor little thing crawled in on her hands and knees up to his feet laid her hands upon his feet and said governor honorable sir said you're the only man that's left that can spare my son please kind sir I know he's guilty he's just as guilty your courts of justice found him guilty and how many of us are not guilty in the courts of God your course of justice found him guilty he actually killed and he's subject to death I know that but sir as a man you have no right to take the life of my boy God only can give life and only God can take life don't do it sir please don't I beg of you a heart of a mother as a heart of a mother could bear and so he sent her away it broke his heart so much the pleading of that mother till he goes down to the jail to the prison where the boy was sitting back in the prison the man had built up a complex just about like the churches does today we'll either preach it the way I like it or I won't hear it at all I won't pay no attention wasn't set there man after man and come to him trying to talk to him he had built himself till he wasn't going to hear no more so the governor walked in he said Son I'd like to talk to you he said shut up and get out of here in his cell he said son I've come to help you said I told you to get out of here that's the way people does the Holy Spirit today yeah get out I don't want nothing to do with it knocks at the door if I do that I'll have to give up my card party I'll have to give this up I'll have to give that up I'll have to give up my church Creed I'll have to give see you better listen he's the only one who's got pardon that's right what are you looking at see he had looked so many things he was afraid to look at this man he kept his head turned that's the way people do today at the altar call they keep their head turned they don't want to hear it they turn their head from God who was telling them that's the truth a little weave voice like a touch you know Elijah he heard the rushing wind Blood Fire smoke and it didn't bother him but when he heard that little voice he come out oh that little voice the church has failed to hear so the man tried his best the governor tried to talk to the boy the boy said are you gonna get out of here or am I going to throw you out turned around and said all right son I've done the best I could do when the he walked out the boy looked around kind of arrogant as he walked down through the hall when he did one of the guards stepped up and said Governor did you do any good he said no he wouldn't listen that boy jumped he grabbed the bar said who was that that was the governor come for your pardon too late then he screamed he cried he said think of it the governor here in my own cell to pardon me and I turned him down and when they put the Rope around his neck before they put the black mask on after he'd walked the 13 steps last words he said think of it the governor stood in my cell for pardoning and I turned him down and they hung him oh there's more than a governor here this morning Jesus Christ is here and that little cell called man or woman he is here to give pardon don't turn him away don't do it find your purpose that God brought you here in life the random tells a similar story in the sermon hear ye him he says I feel like this is the one that we probably all know a little bit better the sermon hearing him he says I believe it was in the days of Abraham Lincoln when a soldier had committed a crime and he was up for execution he was going to be shot before a firing squad and some good friend went to the great Mr Lincoln which was an outstanding Christian he fell on his knees and he said Mr Lincoln they're going to take the life of a man just one word from you will pardon the man he he may be guilty of doing something the ought not have done in military service but I know him he didn't mean to do it won't you pardon him Mr Lincoln and being in a rush he just picked up a piece of paper and said pardon so and so Abraham Lincoln the man bowed politely to him rushed back to the cell and said my friend you are free I've got your part in here from Abraham Lincoln the president of this great United States here is a signature and the man that was in prison said why do you haunt me why do you make fun of me knowing I'm to die in the morning by firing Scott and bring such a piece of paper as that to me and try to make me believe that that's Mr Lincoln's name that he signed it said I I ought to be decorated up it ought to have a seal on it but he was in such a hurry any man knows Mr Lincoln will recognize the signature but he rejected it and the next morning he died by a firing squad he had the news of he was free but he wouldn't accept it then that was tried in a federal court and here was the verdict of the federal court here was Abraham Lincoln's name the president of the United States signed that this man was free and should not die by firing Scott and yet he died by a firing squad now what here was their verdict a pardon is not a pardon unless it be received as a pardon hear ye him it's a challenge it's a command it's a pardon it's all that you have need of if you'll just accept it that way but if you do not accept it that way it's just another piece of paper over and over again we face our choices and yes I know these stories are meant to be more focused on are you going to accept Christ as your savior these were the stories that you put out there to go this is your this is your opportunity to accept that pardon and those of us here we and those of us that are streaming have accepted that pardon we've accepted Christ as our savior but yet time and time again we have more choices to make and it's the same kind of place where it comes down to of you make the choice and here is the governor or here is Abraham Lincoln or here is God going I can help you overcome with this I can over help you I can help you deal with this I can help you handle this situation I'm trying to clean up your life I'm trying to help you take that next step and we have the choice to either accept or reject on each time Choice after choice after choice we get to make that decision time and time again but there's one other story the brother random told and as far as I could find when I was going through I could only find one sermon that he ever told the story in in the story of the message of Grace brother Branham said God's grace is like this let me tell you a story and ending God's grace is like this one time there was a mighty king and this mighty king had a son and it was his only son and one day a murderer killed that boy and through that Kingdom with the delegates hunting for that murderer and they finally found that murder and when they found them they brought him back and imprisoned him and when they did a trial was sent and a sentence was made oh it was a terrible thing he had murdered the King's son and he known what was coming to him they put them into the inner cells they locked the doors they put pads on it so no one the guards around it because we know what kind of horrible punishment this boy was going to receive because he killed the King's son the Royal King's son guards was placed all around the doors he was put in Inner Cell stripped with nothing on but a loincloth there he was set there in that condition starving wouldn't give him nothing to eat he was sitting in that condition they brought him out to a trial he was found guilty and proven guilty a sentence was made that he was to be executed under horrible capital punishment he would be killed by inches until his mortal life was gone sentenced by the judge he was to die and he begged and he cried he said though I'm guilty though I'm guilty I'm sorry that I did it I wish I'd never done it I'm sorry I did it in that moment in a rage of temper I did it and I didn't mean to do it that way one day the king went down to the place to visit the boy to tell him to talk to him to tell him about killing his own son the only son he had he had killed that boy said I'm going down to talk to him and when he went down there he looked back in that cage like a caged in animal he saw this little skinny body laying there in a corner crying his face all sunk in his joists saying Jaws sank back his eyes way back matter was all in his eyes his mouth was all Whited over no water thirsty laying back there on his face crying the king said stand up he come up to him and he looked at him he said why did you kill my son what did my son do to you what did he do to Merit such a death as you killed him stabbing him to death with a spear he said nothing my Lord not one thing just my own impudence just my own ways I killed him because I was jealous of him and I got in a temper fit and I killed him said now I'm to die unto your Justice sir I realized that and I deserve to do it only thing I'm crying for that I'm just sorry that I killed that Royal man like that Without a Cause the king turned on his heels and walked out went out to the deck and said destroy all the records you know put them in the sea of forgetfulness destroy all the records wash them up clean them up I'll send down a rope for him after a while great big limousine drove up to the door when it did a carpet was spread out to the prison cell the king stood at the end of the limousine said come my son and ride home with me to the Palace put the king's robe around his shoulder he said from henceforce you are my son because he had pity that's Grace that was me that was you we killed the Son of God with our sins we were aliens dirty filthy laying in the cells of the world God washed Us by the blood of his own son and cleansed us put on the robe of the Holy Spirit and now the great Chariot of God will back up to the door someday and we'll go home to live with him all records are destroyed we can't be judged no more the musicians will come but random told these stories of these men that couldn't accept their pardon they couldn't accept it because of how it was delivered they couldn't accept it because of how it was said they couldn't accept it because of how it looked they couldn't accept it because of reason after reason after reason but then this story it wasn't rejected he was given the pardon and he accepted it the same as the two thieves on the cross that were brought to the same point and had the same choice to make is demonstrated by these same stories these are in prison sentenced to die and they have their choice do they accept the way of Escape or do they refuse it and every one of our in our lives we have that choice to make with our salvation and then we have that choice to make over and over again as Satan tries to put us behind bars of Oppression or depression or lust or temper or this or that [Music] over and over again we're given that same choice of can we accept the pardon can we accept that as dirty and filthy and wretched as we may look in that cell that God is still willing to take us and clean us up and have Us beside him as his son [Music] or as his bride that he's willing to take that choice three prison cells three choices [Music] two of them still ended up going to death one of them was elevated to the place of sun in who is this in 1959 brother random says when the Holy Ghost come today it brings the same decision each one of us are responsible for our decision we must make it it's here by us it's here with us there's no way around it anymore there's nothing we can do about it we have to reject it or receive it the same life that was in Christ Jesus is in the church today is performing the same works it's doing the same Miracles it's doing everything he did it's Healing The Sick raising the dead cleansing the lepers casting out Devils preaching the gospel the poor is receiving it blessed is he who is not offended go show John he said these things that are done John and the prison as eagle eyes had filmed over his prophetic eye couldn't see like it once seen but then he could see it when he said the lame walk the blind sea the deaf here and blessed is he is not offended in what I do if I do not the works of my father then believe me Dot if I do the works of my father if you can't believe me believe the works now that was his message that's what he said that it must be done that's what we've got to do is to make a decision what will we do with it it's here who is it what is it it's a promise of God by his word that he would do it God promised he would do it and we see it being done now it's up to us to make a decision will we serve will we understand [Music] brother Wendell talked about the anchor this morning and when that storm is really going if you're not a trained sailor it can get tempting to cut the anchor because it feels like those waves keep going up and the anchor only lets you go up so far and it feels like well wouldn't we be better to go ahead and cut anchor and go with the flow a little bit more wouldn't that keep us safer but the trained Sailors will look at you go that's not a choice that anchor stays because as long as the anchor is locked in no matter how hard the storm goes no how matter how bad it may be we're still safe because the anchor is still holding us it's still holding us where we're supposed to be at [Music] the waves crashing all around the waves crashing over the sides of the boat doing all these things and an untrained eyes going let's cut the anchor let's we want to be on top of the Waves I don't want the waves going over top of us this isn't this isn't good and the sailors are going no that's that's what we want to stay right here we don't want to go anywhere throughout our lives we have choices some of them the most simple some of them the hardest we'll ever face we've made that first choice Lord I accept you as my savior Lord I want to serve you Lord I pray that you would wash me in my sins I pray that you would cleanse me I pray that you would give me the Fresh Start but throughout our walk the choices come and you have to keep making those decisions you have to keep deciding what am I going to do [Music] with the man named Christ that's what it comes down to can I trust him can I trust his word can I trust the present word for this day people keep cutting anchor all around us and going no brother Brandon wasn't a prophet I can't accept what he said and you watch the storms of life below them away because they cut their anchor they cut the line they made the choice and Satan wants to get you to that point but we have to keep making the choice go no I trust in where I've anchored I trust that if God anchored me here this is where I'm supposed to stay I trust that if this is what God has called me to do called me where to be [Music] then he's going to get me the rest of the way through brother Wendell what are we going to sing [Music] oh I just want to please [Music] I'll Stand [Music] in his presence [Music] to hear him say Well done someday I just want to please the Lord it is [Music] lost in his presence found in his likeness to him say Well done something please I just wanted to please the Lord is in his presence them in his likeness to hear him say Well done someday God [Music] let's go ahead and pray [Music] Lord Jesus [Music] Lord I know this was just a simple thought Lord it wasn't anything new or earth-shattering lawn but Lord maybe just a a reminder of it that we have to keep choosing Lord have to keep choosing to surrender to you Lord we have to keep choosing to crucify this flesh we have to keep choosing to to feed the white dog and not the black dog Lord I pray that you would help us to turn those choices into habits Lord to make it where it's so normal for us to surrender to your leading lord it's so normal for us to surrender to your will that we do it without thinking Lord because it's no longer us doing the thinking but it's the very mind of Christ within us we're present this evening we just thank you for everything you do we love you [Music] please [Music] be it is willingness to be lost in his presence [Music] or could we all sing it again oh I just wanna please foreign [Music] found in his likeness [Music] someday [Music] praise the Lord so we've got we've got those choices and it's life and death it's good and evil it's it's not really a it's not the uh well it's a good idea or a bad idea Christ in his word is the only idea it's the only choice and if we don't choose that word there is nothing but death and so I think um brother Bradham made this statement he said full obedience to God's word entitles you to the Token entitles you to the Holy Ghost so we want to make sure when we talk about you know you know can't lose your salvation you got to make sure you have your salvation and if you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's his Spirit within you that's leading you and guiding you you were sealed and it's your desire to do the will of the lord it's your absolute desire sometimes we fail and we have to repent we have to as our brother was saying tonight we have to suffer the consequences but when the desire has been placed there by the Holy Spirit amen you can stand there and we can say it's our hearts desire our heart is ripped out because Rebellion can't be in the heart of a of a born-again believer there's no way Rebellion can be in the heart of a of a of a born-again believer because the Holy Spirit has come and arrested you he's taking you um he's taken your heart and he's living in it now he's guiding it do you make your mistakes yes but not willfully do you fail yes but not willfully the heart of rebellion is gone you see what I'm saying so our heart should always be Lord I want to please you and I want to tell you well I have a choice I have a choice where I can I maybe I don't want to obey the word of the Lord I'm saved and my salvation is secured once saved always saved so I can make any choice I want yeah yeah it might I want to tell you you walk away from the thing of God and contrary to the word of God you will suffer hell you will go through hell in your life if you walk away from the from the Commandment of the lord it's not it's it's not something for us to say it's an option there's no other option though we take the option oh God help us help us to walk with you I think I think there was a lot of good things said tonight amen and I I I I think about that about that about that boy [Music] you know the governor in the office there or in the cell amen and I you know I don't want his presence to be among us like this and and and have a have a wonderful wonderful services like this and then and then we turn him down and say well but I've got my own ideas about things I've got my own ideas about scriptures I've got my own ideas about well friends listen if our any idea is against what the prophet has brought to us of Malachi 4. Brothers let us choose you have to choose it now God's not going to make you do it but if you're a born-again Believer you're going to do it is that right it's going to be your desire to do it man now so how how can uh how can a woman keep wearing makeup and lipstick and and wearing pants for those that may be on the internet and and you've heard the message and you've heard [Music] no now you've got a choice you can say oh yes these are wonderful messages you can say oh brother Branham I agree but brother Branham also took us back to scripture [Music] you've got a choice tonight you have a choice you you have a choice to say it's wrong and it's an Abomination for a woman to wear man's clothing that Jezebel was the only one who ever painted her face and God fed her to the dogs you you

of us that are here in the audience those choices are very very very important so let's take this message to Heart Tonight [Music] because it's life and it's death there is there is no good good decision and bad decision this is life and death if you refuse the word of God you will pay the consequences for it I just want to surrender myself to the will of the Lord I want to be a prisoner prisoner of the Lord Jesus Christ can you say Amen how many wants that Heart Lord give me a humble heart give me a humble heart a heart of real a real humility Lord that I can take this sermon that
