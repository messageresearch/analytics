and we ask these Saints in the lovely name of Jesus Christ amen am 1st Samuel the 6th chapter we want to look at the sixth to the eth verse and David was greatly distressed for the people spake a stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved and every man for his sons and for his daughters for David encouraged him but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God and David said to abathar the priest the himac son I pray thee bring me hither the ephod and abathar brought thither the ephod to David and David inquired of the Lord saying shall I pursue after this troop so I overtake them and he answer pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you may be seated I like to read this little story that I got here a going and then after that I'll tell you the title of my text this this evening amen and got brought my I didn't so it's 5:38 trying to get you out here try maybe 45 minutes if I can so my wife's sitting back there tonight you can watch her notebook and you know or whatever so amen but I'd like to read this little story and you know and and my my grandson told me the other day said uh said Papa we went and preach for brother Bry said you going to read a story and I said well said I said Papa that's what you do so I got this little story and like I said it to go along with my thought and it's called mous trap story I don't know if anybody's ever heard it or not but you just get the point said a mouse looked through the crack in the wall to see the farmer and his wife open a package what food might this contain the mouse wondered he was devastated to discover it was a mouse trap retreating to the farmyard the mouse proclaimed the warning there's a mouse trap in the house there's a mouse trap in the house the chicken cluck and scratched raised her head and said Mr Mouse I can tell this is of grave concern to you but it is of no consequences to me I cannot be bothered by it the mouse turned to the pig and told him there's a mouse trap in the head house there's a mouse trap in the house the pig sympathized but said I'm so very sorry Mr Mouse but there is nothing I can do about it but pray be assured you you are in my prayers the mouse turned to the cow and said there's a mouse trap in the house there's a mouse trap in the house the cow said wow Mr Mouse I'm sorry for you but it's no skin off my nose so the mouse returned to the house head down and dejected to face the farmer's mouse trap alone that very night a sound Was Heard throughout the house like the sound of a mous trap catching its prey the farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught in the darkness she did not see it was a venomous snake whose tail the Trap had caught the snake bat the farmer's wife the farmer rushed her to the hospital and she returned home with a fever everyone know you treat a fever with fresh chicken soup so the farmer took his Hatchet to the farmyard for the soup's Main Ingredients but his wife sickness continued so friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock to feed them the farmer butchered the pig the farmer's wife did not get well she died so many people came for her funeral funeral the farmer had the cow slaughtered to provide enough meat for all of them the Mouse looked upon it from his crack in the wall with great sadness so the next thing you so the next time you hear someone is facing a problem and think it doesn't concern you remember when one of us is threatened we all are at risk we're all involved in this journey called life we must keep an eye out for one another and make an extra effort to encourage one another I thought that was pretty good amen so my thought for tonight is encourage yourself in the Lord encourage yourself in the Lord so I just dropped by this weekend to tell you that we need to encourage oursel in him tonight amen so I take this little thought and I thought you know I was thinking about David and really I think about every man that that uh the the people that God uh used in the Bible and that he called their names like Abraham and and and Moses and Noah and one thing about every one of these people in the Bible men and women alike children alike you know they're all were were human beings just like me and you are and they all went through problems just like me and you do and they all need encouragement just like me and you do because every now and then we just need a kind word to be said to us uh we just need uh H H A Kind word to be spoken to us am I right about it so we we need something to encourage us amen and so why not just take the word of God when we there's nobody around to say a kind word to us when there's nobody around to encourage just why don't we just take the word of God down and encourage oursel in the Lord tonight is that right amen so I just thank about that tonight and like I said David I like David not maybe because his name's David but I appreciate him because even the prophet of God said and the Bible says that David was a man after God's Own Heart and that's what I want to be tonight is a man after God's Own Heart I I want to be somebody that God can depend on that God can use amen I want to be one that's a man after his own heart and brother Bram said it like this that he had a spirit of quick repentance uh every time he made a mistake he repented of it that's what I want to be Lord cuz the Lord knows that I make plenty of mistakes I fail them every day I fail them every second of the day but hey I want to say God help me I Repent Lord if I made a mistake forgive me Lord let me pick myself up and dust myself off again and keep pressing on yes keep pressing on so and this looking at David you know many times he got in trouble even being a man after God's Own Heart and I think about one time where David he numbered the people and he'd done it before he done this before but this time I think he did it maybe with a wrong attitude or whatever you know cuz God always he always had to remind the people I just reading it in Psalms how that he always reminded the people how that he brought them out of Egypt andin he sometimes he's always reminding me and you man when things get to going kind of bad or or we get kind of down or or whatever he always reminds us hey I'm the one that brought you out of the world I'm the one that brought you out of the denominationalism I'm the one that set your feet on the Rock to stay I'm the one that provided you Revelation I'm the one that brought you into the message I'm him and I brought you out he's always having to remind us oh God I want to remember what he's done for me oh oh I tell you what I words can't express how I feel about what God has done for me oh I can't hardly I can't hardly sometimes I can't hardly take it I can't hardly stand it amen it just like it's just like fire shut up in my bones amen I think about what God has done for me and how he's been so good to me how he's provided me with a family with a good wife and everything else and sometimes sometimes I treat him like you know and oh you know you know how it is sometimes but I want to say God forgive me help me Lord I'll try to be more better I'll try to do better than what I've had before so David numbered the people and so there was a sear in the land by the name of GAD he came to David and said David youve done wrong you number the people and see God has said three things and you got a choice to make he's giv you an option you know what you want done cuz you go you going to have to you know the the Bible says and it's a law that whatever we sow we got to reap I hate that but sometimes it is you know you plant corn and you think you're going to get no you planted corn that's what you're going to get and sometimes we plant discouragement we we plant that and that's what we'll reap I I want to plant what God I want to plant good seed amen I want to plant encouragement I want to plant Joy I want to plant everything so anyway he told the Gad The Seer he said now David God has given you option he's giving you you you have a choice to make there's seven years of famine flee before your enemies for three months or three days of pestilence in the land what a choice what a choice and David told the sear he said man I'm in a great straight I don't know what to do he begin to repent he said you know what I just think I'll fall into the hands of almighty God I'll just let God help me amen because I know that if God helped me God's merciful amen when man ain't merciful God's merciful when man are put you in hell when you don't deserve to be there amen God is still merciful I like I like that God is merciful amen oh Hallelujah so he told God he said I mean so he said I'll just fall in the hands of almighty God cuz he he's merciful and then looking at that there were 70,000 men that lost their lives 70,000 can can you imagine sly because of the actions of David oh God we got to be careful what we say what we do and how we act cuz our actions can hinder a service our actions can hinder somebody getting healed our actions could hinder somebody getting saved our actions can H hinder somebody from not getting the Holy Ghost and I don't want my actions to hinder anybody because of David's action 70,000 men lost their lives and begin to repent and the Lord laid it on his heart told him what he needed to do said Hey listen this is what you need to do David you need to rear up an altar and he told him where to rear it up at said you need to build an altar in the threshing floor of Onan the jebusite and so David looking and God had laid it on his heart what to do even though he repented said he needed to rear up that altar so he went there and on land the J sight and looking at that he gave David everything he needed to offer the sacrifice he gave him the tools he gave them the the instruments to offer the sacrifice even gave him the animal to offer the sacrifice with even gave them everything the the wood to build the altar the the the fire to you know to build the everything that he could to build the fire everything and David said you know God forbid that I would not I want to pay full price for it amen cuz God forbid that I would offer God a sacrifice that would not cost me nothing God tonight I'm going to sacrifice sometimes amen sometimes it's a sacrifice to come into the house of God when everybody's gone amen and the way and it's a sacrifice to come in and worship God but I want to Lord I don't want to offer you a sacrifice that ain't going to cost me nothing Lord let me come in and when I don't feel like clapping let me clap when I don't feel like raing my hands let me raise my hands in worship to you hallelujah hallelujah it's going to cost me something amen God forbid that I would offer to God a sacrifice that wouldn't cost me nothing what's it going to cost you amen Hey Brother Wendell preached only the cost of Our Praise amen you don't know what I been through amen you don't know what I've been going through hallelujah oh but I thank God tonight he still got Grace he still got power to see us through amen and so David amen you know his faith had failed him how many sometimes your faith has failed you hey man you think this is going to happen and this is going to happen but it goes in all a different direction than what you thought it was going to be amen maybe you thought he was going to go like this and like this and like this but he went like that like that and like that and you get kind of discouraged you pray and it seems like your prayers amen you pray for your kids amen come on now amen you pray for your kids seem like they get worse amen you pray for this and this and pray for the service and my I think the service is going to go that way but it goes opposite way than what you prayed and sometimes your faith gets a lot you get kind of discouraged Faith kind of fails you how many's ever been that way oh hallelujah amen so D David's faith it kind of failed him he became disheartened he became discouraged amen how many he's been there man I don't know who I'm speaking to maybe some of you there tonight you become kind of kind of disheartened kind of discouraged because you think well this ought to happen this ought to happen you know I gu God just trying to keep you humble amen you go somewhere come back after a meeting or somewhere preaching car breaks down he say oh God what am I going to but you keep on praising him anyway you keep on pressing anyway amen you keep on fighting anyway amen you know you get up to go to church on a Sunday morning amen you wake up amen it seem like you got 2,000 lb demons each eyelid but you got to get up anyway and come on and say God I'm going anyway I don't feel like it but I'm going anyway I'm going down to the house of God and I'm going to praise you anyway I'm going to offer sacrifice to you anyway I'm going to lift my hands anyway Lord hallelujah and so we become kind of dis Hur and kind of discouraged and that's where David was and brother Bram said it like this God never did call us to a picnic he called us to a battlefield amen so we didn't come down here this morning or tonight to throw out our our uh black our red and check it uh uh picnic uh spread or blanket amen we didn't come down here to eat cookies and drink milk but we come to battle amen we come to that's why a lot of people don't like to come to the house of God anymore because it's a battle Yeah to come to the house of God Amen it's a struggle sometimes to come to the house of God I say God help me amen but said it like this I might have said it here before but I say it again we're going each and every one of us I don't know what you're going through but how many's going through a battle amen let's be honest take the Halos down tonight let's be honest how many's going through a battle amen and you know what you either battle every day amen you battle every day let me say it like this you're either in a battle coming out of a battle or fixing to go into a battle you go my Lord there ain't no way out of it no there ain't like I said either in a battle coming out of a battle or going into a battle it's no picnic ground amen but when Jesus be the cross alone no there's a cross for everyone and there's a cross for me it's like this what sometimes gets us is the in between you said Brother David what are you talking about well God promised us a Rapture didn't he yes amen didn't he promise us a rapture well sometimes it's the in between that gets us the in between of the promise and the Fulfillment of the promise God promis us healing every one of us but sometimes it's the in between that gets us between the pro the time we got prayed for the promise claiming our promise claiming our healing and the manifestation of the healing amen the in between sometimes H like I ain't saying this to be funny but like this little girl one time came up she said I got a headache they said well we'll just pray for you prayed for her came back said I still I still got this headache so we prayed for you we're just waiting for the manifestation came back about an hour later said I still got this headache said well just well we just we prayed for you just take God's word and believe we're just waiting for the manifestation came back later and said Ma I wish that man from the station would hurry up and get here amen I'm still suffering with my head amen but get here keep holding on keep pressing on the promise to be here amen just wait he made the promise he made Abraham a promise but Abraham had to wait 25 you imagine Abraham got kind of discouraged when they came to hey uh father Nations how many children you got the now said he had to say not but he kept holding on now listen what the prophet said I just looked this up in the back I thought my this is real good I ain't going to read all of it cuz it's pretty lengthy but it's out of the church age book y'all been going through the church ages but it's uh in the Philadelphian Church age this is what the prophet of God said he said what does it mean by the word of my patience Hebrews 6:1 13-15 for when God made a promise to Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee and so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you see the spirit is speaking about the word of God which is given to us it's given to all of us is that right the promise is given to all of us to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience oh God did help me he's still working on me amen I need more patience God help me he said and the wait said hey he's still working on patience amen he said it required to wait for the Fulfillment of that word required patience Abraham had to require require patience and the Bible says he endured what about us we're promised a change of body a Rapture are we going to endure or are we going to just throw in the towel that's why I want to take the word of God down and encourage myself with it and say God I'm going to keep holding on you promised it Lord you never failed I'm going to keep holding on to your word I'm gonna keep holding on to your promise Lord amen I'm gonna keep pressing on he said even as it did in the case of Abraham he endured as seeing him who is invisible he was patient and then the word finally was fulfilled this is the way God teaches his people this is why God teaches his people patience why if he fulfilled his word and physical manifestations the very instant you prayed you would never learn patience it goes on you can read that Philadelphia and church age I thought my Lord all of us need to learn a little patience then help me Lord amen you ever pray for patience you better watch

now and then don't it but the bypasses and the detours are a lot rougher satting there that train this afternoon I thought my what they doing I didn't know what had happened to somebody told me I thought man they're taking a break they're taking a lunch break don't they know that we other people got to eat I mean they're taking a lunch break and then after lunch break they're going to smoke a cigarette and all this kind I said Lord help us and then we went through a little detour I said that was rough seen this seen sister Keys up ahead of me go through that mud hole and I go oh my and I Saidi just wash my truck before I left the house hey man I've been here two weeks and it's dirty again but I'll have to wash it before I leave maybe amen I thought my Lord amen I remember brother Billy Paul he tells this on testimony he said I remember one time when my the prophet of God said you can't stay here and do the things that you're doing so he wouldn't live with his grandmother he said this house is dedicated to the Lord now brother B Paul tells it like this he said I went out there and was living my grandma cuz I was doing things I wasn't supposed to be doing amen man and one time he was even doing something and they they noticed and they said hey ain't you William brandom's son he said No Sir William brandom would have a son like me sometimes they ask you say hey are you a Christian ain't you supposed to be a son or a daughter of God no sir no ma'am God wouldn't have a son or a daughter like me amen doing the things that I'm doing God help me and so something happened and offer I forget what kind of was that ruptured and he had to go and his grandma they had to sign for the do he said I don't know I don't know his D ain't here but you know what God is always merciful amen he works on both ends at the same time or brother BR was up in Colorado in the mountains God came down and spoke to him said get to Billy Billy need you amen him laying up there in the hospital one brother R walked in that room Billy's face lit up said Daddy go to praying he said Billy I didn't do the sinning you did the sinning you do the praying he said the way of a transgressor is awful hard so sometimes we may think the King's Highway is awful rough but the bypass and The Detour are a whole lot rougher I want to stay on the King's Highway I'm walking up the King's Highway amen so David he begin to say in his heart you know probably one of these days I'll probably die at the hands of Saul maybe you made a statement like that before you know one of these days I'll probably I'll probably falter I'll probably fail ain't no use to keep on but just hold on Amen just keep pressing so David said that so my I'll probably die so he went into the land of the Philistines him and 600 of his men and the Bible says he hook up he hooked up with King aish if I'm saying that right and he said he said I he said so he told King aish he said in the in the land of gath there and he said and and he said you know what king of kiss the king of gath he said you know what king if I found favor in your sight just give me a little town in the country why should I and my men dwell with you in the Royal City just give me a little town in the countryside so they gave him ziklag and so there he dwelt six him and 600 of his men down there in a little city called ziklag for about 16 months they dwelt there and oh my David every day King kiss said David what you do for me today and David would say well I went out this way to the north and I made a road to the north and I slew all the enemies and I brought back the spoils and then the next day would say well I went to the South and I brought back all the spoils and here's the spoils that I brought back and here's all these things and I made oh and oh kiss my he he just he just loved David he just bragged on David so much and he just begin to say about David said my David you you just you're just good and you believe David saying he has made Israel to utterly a boore that means disgust and hate him said my David You' just been so good to me and the King really believed in David my he believed him so much that he made him his right-hand man and so David was became his a kiss's right-hand man said David I know what you can do I'm just going to make you my right-hand man so it came a day when the Philistines were gathered themselves and they was going to go fight against Israel and they wanted King aiss and his men to join up with them now can you imagine here they are and David with them can you imagine cuz the king said David I want you to come and fight with us now here's David going out to fight against his own people my but you know what the Lord he always knows just what to do he's never too late and he's never too early but he's right on time I'm glad for that hey man never too late never too early but he's right on time Heen he said David I know what you can do You' been with me for these 16 months you come in you did this and you did this you destroyed this enemy you destroyed that enemy you made Israel to other hate me and I know man I know all that you can do and what you can do and so here they went out and and and and a Kish and his men get with the Philistine and here come David and his men in the rear and amen and all my they was going up there and all of a sudden the Philistines said hey what's these Hebrews doing here why they're here you know what said are they they going to fight said hey and and and the kids king of kids be begin to say Hey listen have you not heard don't you know about David don't you know about what he's done and how they sung the song David Saul has slew his thousands but David his 10 thousands and this is David and said he's been with me for about these 16 months I know what he can do and how he's been here and there and the Hebrews said nah I we don't want him to go we heard about David we heard about the songs they sung about David and wonder during the war they're in the battle when it's hot and heavy and he gets reconciled uh with his master and he'll do that by taking our heads off our shoulders so we don't want him to go if he's going to go we ain't going and so the King goes back over there to David and said David I'm sorry I know what you can do David I don't find no I ain't found no fault in you David you've been with me you've been good I made you my right hand I made you my armor Bearer made you my right-hand man I know what you can do David you've been with me these 16 months but they saying hey they've heard about you David and they don't want to fight they don't want you going with us so early in the morning why don't you go back down his ZB so David and his men rose up early went back down there to Zig lag but you know what I believe it was God's divine intervention amen because when he went back ma David could pin these words Psalms 124:7 our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the Fowler the snare is broken and we are escaped you know sometimes we we get in trouble and it's because of her own Folly how many believes that tonight because of your own Folly because of something you've done you get yourself in trouble you should have listened when you went into action or you should have went into action when you should have been listen listening and sometimes because cuse their own Folly but don't you believe God has divine intervention oh that sometimes he can amen he can work it all out when it seems like it looks like it's all going to fail and it's all going to be a a disaster got to work it out amen and so I believe God worked it out because of his folly he still wanted to trust in God oh I believe that this morning brother Mike amen or this afternoon amen even though my Folly my Folly I may have been in trouble because my own Folly but I still want to trust in the armor of almighty God tonight amen oh my as he's coming back amen and amen and he begins you know he begins to rehearse that I'm going back you know I'm going down here but you know what the Bible says he begin to remember his youthful days and he begin to take down his diary how many knows what a diary is and there's not too many young sisters in here you know but maybe Brian and some of them you know diary you write down there your special stuff that you don't want anybody to know well I know he's the one for me because when we both reached for the broccoli on the salad bar at the same time our hands touched one another oh he's the one and we write it down in our diary but you know what I got written down in mine tonight I got rent down the things that the Lord has done for me amen and I want to take my diary down and David begin to remember say hey I remember amen when I was I I'm a shepherd and I took care of my father's sheep and it's a disgrace for a Shepherd to lose any sheep and I remember when a bear came in there and I got up cuz it's a disce and I didn't want to lose a sheep that was watching out for my father and I went after that sheep and I I slew that bear and brought the Sheep back safely into the fold then lion rose up amen and stole a sheep and I went after that sheep killed the lion and brought him back safely into the Foe and maybe he said if God done it for me one time he can do it again and he encouraged himself in the Lord I want to say tonight if God healed me one time amen he can heal me again if he delivered me one time he can deliver me again and he encouraged himself in the Lord hallelujah amen so looking over the runs of that City he probably begin to say you know what I see the RS cuz the Bible said we read there that his men thought about stoning him cuse their wives have been taken captive and their sons and daughters have been taken captive but David had to take the word of God and encourage himself and he looked over that City he probably thought he probably was aching not only for himself cuz his wives both of his wives were taken captive and his and his uh sons and his daughters but he was aching for his men cuz he was a great leader and he was aching for him and he begin to look you know what all my men are thinking about stoning me look at what I done how and this trouble has come because of where I'm at and all this how many ever felt that way look at all these things that are happening if I hadn't went there well amen if I hadn't said this I hadn't have done that maybe I'd be all right tonight but because of this but David begin to look he said you know what I see the ruins I see my wives taking captive I see these other men's wife I see there but you know what yet the Lord still loves me he still loves you tonight amen yet he still loves you although I wandered away from him my heart can't rest without him though I've had little fellowship with him lately I ain't listening to tapes like I should I ain't prayed like I should I ain't fasted like I should I ain't dedicated my life like I should but yet he hasn't shut up his vows of compassion upon me and he's always been gracious to me amen and so he begin to encourage himself in the Lord amen I think about when Nathan the prophet in that day came to him and David begin to pour out his heart and David said you know what he said I he said why should I dwell in this house like a I like this house that I dwell in and God the ark dwells in tents amen he said I just want to do I want to build a house for him and Nathan told him said you go do with all that's within on your heart David you just do it well God has a program amen he's never and so he told the prophet he said you go and tell David he can't do it because he shed too much innocent blood he's done this and he's done this and tell him about his his his son I do it but you tell David that I took him I remember when he was a nobody when I when he was just hurting his father's sheep and I took him for a sheep from the Sheep coat and made a great name out of him amen I I made I took him when he was nothing and made something out of him amen I took him when he was a nobody and made somebody out of him and I cut off his enemies and David could encourage himself in the Lord what about us tonight amen he took us when we was nothing and brought us to a message that has rapt and gra fa Grace in it amen thank you Lord amen and mighty great name cut off your enemies amen how many ever gets to discouraged how many I'll tell you one thing how many ever thinks that God don't love you how many has ever been there amen come on we all go through that that think that God don't and if the devil can get us to believe in that he's got us whipped amen he he he don't want us to believe that the Lord really loves him well my wife was going through that one time we was living in amarilla Texas and my we would you just going through that she said you know what I don't really think the lord loves me you know you've been there had you every one of us come on we've been there and so as she was getting her car and I can't remember if she had the kids with or not but she was getting up on I 40 brother murl and there's a car pastor with a bumper stick on it and said Jesus loves you and she could encourage herself in the Lord amen oh don't you believe that Inc she said you Lord I need a little bit of something else amen she turned on the radio and there's a preacher on the radio said I just stopped by this morning to tell you how much God loves you amen I just stopped by this afternoon to tell you how much God loves you to how much he cares for you how much he loves you how much he takes care of you and he provides for his own and we can encourage oursel in him hallelujah hallelujah oh David could say like this has not God chosen me ordained me to be king Heen amen even when Samuel went to anoint him Samuel was kind of scared because he said what's Saul gonna say he said if you come in contact with Saul just say you're going down there to sacrifice at Jesse's house and just invite him to come along with you amen when he got down there Saul thought he was going hey the first one to come he thought my head and shoulders he said that's not him you look on the outward I'm looking on the inward amen and every one of them passed by until Little David come amen cuz he said ain't you got one more Jesse said I got one more he's kind of Ruddy ain't very much to look at amen he's down there hurting my sheet said well bring him here there cuz we ain't going to sit down till he comes amen and when people looked amen at a Shepherd boy God saw a king Hallelujah when God looks down at us tonight little old church in Pony Oklahoma amen maybe not much amen but God don't see that when people see that God don't see that God sees a bride God sees his chosen wife Hallelujah and we can encourage oursel in him they begin to say hey he ordained me to be king amen Lord you ordained me to be King Samuel anointed me I've been separated from my kin folk I've been hunted by Saul and we can apply that to ourselves he chosen me before the foundation of the world made me to be a priest and King unto himself let me to know my destiny and I can encourage myself in him tonight the Bible says it like this Psalms 11971 says it like this it was good for me that I have been afflicted that I might learn his statues sometimes it's good for us to go through things we can learn the statues of God hallelujah I want to put my trust in him when David came by said there was nothing to tie him back to the Philistines everything had been destroyed amen now let me read you some scriptures they can keep up with me Psalms 31:24 says be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart all ye that hope in the Lord Psalms 33:18 behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear Him upon them that hope in his Mercy Psalms 38:9 deliver me from all my transgressions make me not the reproach of the foolish Psalms 42:5 why thou cast down oh my soul and Why th disquised in me hope thou in God for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance Psalms 56: 3 and 4 what time I'm afraid I will trust in thee verse four in God will I praise His word in God I have put my trust I will not fear what flesh can do unto me Psalms 5611 in God have I put my trust I will not be afraid what man can do unto me Psalm 71:4 deliver me oh my God out of the hand of the wicked out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man verse five for thou art My Hope Oh Lord Thou Art my trust from my youth Psalms 11981 my soul ftth for my thy s ation but I hope in thy word Psalms 146:5 happy is he that hath the god of Jacob for his help whose hope is in the Lord his God Lamentations 3:24 the Lord is my portion sayith my soul therefore will I hope in him Hallelujah I'm going to hope in him brother Brandon said it like this on 1959 what is the Holy Ghost he said he said as for Moses said it like this said Moses for your part I'm your satisfied portion and that's what the Holy Ghost is for the church Silver and Gold Have I None but I have a satisfied portion oh we got a satisfied portion tonight and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just on this flesh not just on the spirit but down on the inside of the inside that anchors let the winds blow let the storms come I'm anchored in Jehovah and I can encourage myself in him tonight I'm your satisfied portion Joel 3:16 said it like this the Lord also shall Roar out a Zion and utter his voice from Jerusalem and the heavens and the Earth shall Shake but the Lord will be the hope of his people and the strength of the children of Israel amen he'll be our hope and our strength I like that Romans 4:20 he's talking about Abraham you know like I said read that about he said he endured patiently waiting for the promise waited patiently just like mean you got to do and he waited patient for the promise hallelujah oh God and I can see Abraham he's like I said earlier at the beginning of this they were men just like me and you are I imagine he got kind of discouraged amen he got kind of discouraged he got kind of disheartened people look at him can you imagine there he was Sarah being uh 95 him 100 but when they first had it he was she was 65 she was 75 you know brother brand said like this he was dead amen he was sterile she was dead amen all dried up and everything but hey you're going to have a kid you're going to have a son call his name Isaac can you imagine people begin look at what's wrong with you Abraham didn't you he might have got discouraged he might have felt like giving up but you know what he kept holding on Amen kept patiently enduring amen God made the promise that is there in between am I going to stay faithful or I'm going to give up he said I'll stay faithful and he be probably maybe had to take the word and encourage himself said God you made the promise amen it's like this I was reading it the other day when brother BR talking about 1956 faithful Abraham say God put a deep sleep oh Abraham then that smoke and it got dark he said that's like everybody amen we're going to have to die amen then was smoking furnace amen everybody we going to die and we deserve hell but them other two pieces he didn't tear them but there was a bright light came up what was it testifying of the Cross amen hallelujah amen it's a cross if it wasn't for Calvary one of us we neither one of us would be here this this afternoon amen but I thank God for Calvary and I can encourage myself in the Lord amen hallelujah and so Paul wrote it up like this after all them years he said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God all them failures he might have went through and discouragements the Bible says he staggered not thank God that's me and you because we're the Royal Seed of Abraham tonight Abraham in spite of all his mistakes you know and every one time mention is unbelief count those things that are not as though they were amen that's what I'm counting tonight those things that are not as though they are let me tell you this I came

Brown said it like this I Pray for 500 people tonight and they all die I'll pray for 500 more tomorrow night that don't mean that God's Not A Healer I I he ain't a Healer because I say he is but he's a Healer because his word declares that he's healer and I'm going to encourage myself in him hallelujah amen let me hurry bring this to a close Amen brother BR say it's not my it's not I ain't uh looking at my merits amen I ain't trusting in my prayers this was his prayer but I'm trusting in his grace oh that's what I'm doing I'm trusting his grace I think about John the Baptist amen oh here he was he was in jail amen oh he thought my what am I doing in jail and he he he and his eyes got kind how his eyes have got kind of skimmed over every now and then you think well I wonder if this message is really right or not come on you with me tonight amen and so John said I wonder if it's him or should we look for another so he's told his disciples said you go down there and ask John or ask Jesus said is he the one or after he already IND introduced him said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world but his eyes got kind his Eagle Eye got kind of fmed over he said go ask him he's the one or should we look for another and so when Jesus told his disciples that John had sent down there he didn't say here's a book seven steps how to have joy in prison give this to John when you go back no he just say stay around and see what you have see what you see in this meeting what did they see the lame begin to walk the dumb begin to speak the deaf begin to hear and the gospel the poor had the gospel preached to him they saw him and as they started to go back to tell John he said hey wait a minute don't only tell them what you saw but also tell him this there's not a man that's been born of a woman greater than John Hallelujah and when they went down there what did he tell them what did his disciples tell John they told him what he seen amen what he what they had heard and did he say anything else oh yes Johnny also said this there was not been a man born of a woman greater than you are John and John could encourage himself in the Lord come take this head off my shoulders I'm ready to go I'm ready to get out out of here amen like Paul said I'm ready to go Amen to Nero's Chop block Halls he went amen he didn't care he was ready to go he was ready to give up amen cuz he said I've laid up a he said there's laid up for me a crown that's waiting on me amen I fought a good fight I kept the faith and he could encourage himself he told Joshua be a good courage amen whereever the S of your feet is tro that's yours it's possession it's yours claim it amen claim what's yours I wonder if we can claim what ours is ours tonight what do you tell David I like David oh what a man of God he was what a great leader he was cuz he got the epod begin to inquire the Lord he said go he said shall I pursue amen shall I shall I go after them he said pursue and you shall uh overtake them and you shall without fail recover all amen I'm going back down the enemy's camp tonight I'm going to take back what the enemy stole for me I'm going to encourage myself in him tonight I'm going to take down back my dad's I'm going to take down back my song I'm going to take back my Shout I can encourage myself in him Hall amen hallelujah hallelu what do he tell Peter it's like this I'm closing I'm closing musicians come amen what did he tell Peter Peter said Lord when he told when the Lord said I got to be crucified this is going to happen and Peter said not no not my my Lord how they'll never crucify you Lord he said Peter get behind me what you say was the things that be of man and not of God Peter said I'll stay right with you Lord because Jesus said everybody's going to you all deny me tonight Peter said Not Me Lord I like Peter oh brother Mitch a man's man you know Burley cut somebody's ear off just had a drop of a hat he said I'll not deny you Lord he said Peter before the crows three times you did not or twice you'll did not me three times no not me and you remember he did he denied them when they came said you're one no I'm not him nobody come no he the Bible said he swore said he cursed said I'm not him and then the crowed twice and Peter went out and Peter pray thought it like this I'm gone I'm I'm doomed look what I did I told the Lord I

all is well there is a place of perfect rest behind the H Veil so rest little bride rest for all is well you know David in the story that brother Gavin was telling us about he encourages himself in the Lord Lord and then tells the priest to bring the ephod and asks shall I pursue shall I overtake and it says and he answered him pursue for Thou shalt surely overtake them and without fail recover all he had encouraged himself and then he received the word of God and he was able to rest because the promise had been given he left knowing he was going to have victory he could walk out he was chasing the enemy but he already knew it was over he already knew it was done the victory had been promised he encouraged himself and then when the word of God came to him he was able to go into rest knowing what it was going to be we are in this age where we have those times of discouragement we have those times of problems that come along and we have to encourage ourselves but we have it even better where the word of God has already been given to us we already have the message for this age we already know the promise that's been handed to us we already have the promise that God's our healer we already have the promise that God's our provider we already have the promise that God will meet every need and so we can sit there and we can encourage ourselves in the word and immediately enter into that rest because it's already been said it's already been done the promise is already there we're simp simply waiting for the manifestation we're simply waiting for it to show but we can be in rest because the word's already spoken we already have that word to fall back on I really enjoyed the service this evening it was it was just a blessing you know we want to uh be remembering Brother David obviously he's worked hard today remember the that he could get the rest that he needs is uh they will be preparing to to travel back to to Alabama in a couple days so pray that both he and Sister Laura can be rested and ready to to travel and ready to get on the road and know it's been a a blessing for for us having them here to help with with the kids and everything um I get some some time off from work but we were able to work it out work it out where since they were here I've kept working and I'll take my time off after they leave so my wife gets help for a little bit extra
