[1:05:03] the goodness of God all right that's
[1:05:06] what brother Brandon said he was doing
[1:05:08] he was thinking on the goodness of
[1:05:10] God and I think we ought to do that
[1:05:13] sometimes we ought to take the time to
[1:05:15] stop and thank God for his goodness to
[1:05:18] say Lord you've been good to me you've
[1:05:21] helped me through life you've given me a
[1:05:23] good family Lord I Thank you for my

[1:05:48] thankful she stuck with me all of these
[1:05:50] years and all these years we believe for
[1:05:52] the promise and maybe she hadn't had my
[1:05:55] revelation but but she stuck with me
[1:05:57] through the time and I'm thankful for
[1:05:59] that he sat there and he said I'm
[1:06:01] thankful maybe you thank God for the
[1:06:03] tree that he was sitting there under
[1:06:05] that had grown up and he said Lord I
[1:06:07] didn't plant this tree but you planted
[1:06:10] this tree and maybe like the church that
[1:06:12] we go to you know it's easy to get
[1:06:14] negative about the church and it's easy
[1:06:16] to begin to look at it and see some
[1:06:18] leaves falling and say well maybe it's
[1:06:21] done maybe it's dying but Abraham said
[1:06:23] there's the Lord I Thank you for

[1:07:10] pastor that there is and I'm just so
[1:07:12] thankful Lord and then God begins to
[1:07:15] appear to you when you begin to think
[1:07:17] about his
[1:07:18] goodness it's easy to be
[1:07:21] critical but when we begin to think
[1:07:23] about his goodness things begin to
[1:07:25] change
[1:07:26] change Hallelujah Abraham taught us that
[1:07:29] sheep huddled together In the Heat of
[1:07:31] the day Abraham was sitting there in the
[1:07:34] heat of the day and sheep don't separate
[1:07:36] In the Heat of the day he said they
[1:07:37] huddle
[1:07:38] together Oh my he said well when I
[1:07:40] huddle together I get hot that's cuz you
[1:07:42] got too many of your rights left on you
[1:07:44] if you get your right shaved off of you
[1:07:46] maybe you you'd be a little more cool
[1:07:48] and you could huddle with the other
[1:07:49] sheep standing each other's shade oh my
[1:07:57] help me
[1:08:00] Lord we should be grateful for one
[1:08:04] another don't take it for granted that

[1:08:20] of God he said well the pews beside me
[1:08:22] are empty well maybe maybe if you just

[1:08:50] mistakes and yet he said you didn't
[1:08:53] count one of them to me and I'm sitting
[1:08:55] here realizing that yeah I made mistakes

[1:09:05] every one of us could be grateful for
[1:09:07] that this morning you gave me an
[1:09:08] unconditional Covenant you didn't leave
[1:09:10] me in my misery you didn't leave me just
[1:09:13] out here in the world somewhere but you
[1:09:15] gave me a covenant that did not depend
[1:09:17] on My Success it did not depend on how
[1:09:20] much money I had in the bank it did not
[1:09:22] depend on how loud I shouted it did not
[1:09:25] on how good I was but you said I chose
[1:09:28] you before the foundation of the world
[1:09:30] you belong to me oh we ought to be

[1:09:52] but was strong in faith other words he
[1:09:54] did not wave in the midst of a mind
[1:09:57] battle but he was strong in other words
[1:09:59] grew stronger in faith and the more the
[1:10:03] older he got the farther the promised
[1:10:06] Got Away scientifically the closer
[1:10:08] Abraham got to God and the more he

[1:12:43] God had provided for him he said I'm
[1:12:44] going to serve you with all of my heart
[1:12:53] Hallelujah God had revealed himself to
[1:12:55] Abraham in Genesis 17 as the almighty
[1:12:59] God when he was 90 years old and nine
[1:13:02] the Lord appeared to him and said I am
[1:13:05] the almighty God walk before me and be
[1:13:08] thou perfect and brother Abraham
[1:13:11] believed God then because he had an
[1:13:13] approach brother R said he had an
[1:13:14] approach through a
[1:13:16] name you and I have an approach through
[1:13:18] a name he said so have we an approach
[1:13:21] through a name
[1:13:23] Jesus that's your approach to God what
[1:13:26] does Jesus mean to us
[1:13:29] savior El Shi to Abraham satisfier
[1:13:33] strong one salvation Giver strength
[1:13:36] Giver he said the same thing that elai
[1:13:38] was to Abraham Jesus is to the
[1:13:42] believer and so else should I become
[1:13:45] Abraham's approach to
[1:13:47] God Amen and brother BR said when
[1:13:50] Christians begin to get that Satan
[1:13:52] begins to get ready to leave when you
[1:13:55] realize that your approach is there you
[1:13:57] can call on the name of Jesus when
[1:13:59] things are tough you can call on the
[1:14:00] name of Jesus when when the church isn't
[1:14:03] going right when the world's not going
[1:14:04] right when politics aren't going right
[1:14:06] when your job is is ending or or the
[1:14:09] finances are drying up you can call on
[1:14:11] Jesus during that time that's your
[1:14:14] access to all the riches of
[1:14:17] God
[1:14:19] hallelujah amen he said when Christians
[1:14:21] begin to get that Satan begins to get
[1:14:22] ready to leave he's finished when people
[1:14:25] can say I don't care no certain healer
[1:14:28] has to come
[1:14:31] by come on
[1:14:33] church all these people say they don't
[1:14:35] believe in prayer lines if brother
[1:14:37] brandham come back they believe in
[1:14:38] prayer
[1:14:43] lines that right they just don't believe
[1:14:47] in the preachers that's the problem but
[1:14:49] it's not about the preacher it's about
[1:14:51] Elohim coming down in his body
[1:14:55] finding himself a body and laying hands
[1:14:57] on the sick and the Bible says it's
[1:15:00] about God keeping his
[1:15:02] word hallelujah hallelujah amen he said
[1:15:06] no certain thing has to happen only
[1:15:08] thing I want on Earth is to hear that
[1:15:09] God said so oh it's that you today
[1:15:12] there's only one thing I want to hear on
[1:15:13] Earth and that's that God said so amen
[1:15:16] he said I he said that settles it with
[1:15:18] me then I'll take it and go from right
[1:15:19] there he said then you got
[1:15:22] it then you got it
[1:15:26] hallelujah hallelujah Abraham had to
[1:15:28] have this Revelation so he would
[1:15:31] recognize the messenger that God sent he
[1:15:34] taught us that he appeared to Abraham in
[1:15:35] this name and and while he recognized
[1:15:38] while he appeared to him in this name
[1:15:40] Abraham recognized who he was and he
[1:15:42] changed Abraham's name and brother
[1:15:45] Brandon said now he's come to the
[1:15:47] fullness of
[1:15:49] believing now he's come to the fullness
[1:15:51] of believing now see where the church
[1:15:53] has come he said I hope you can read
[1:15:55] between the lines come up to the place
[1:15:57] where he's revealed to him who he was
[1:15:59] and then he changed Abraham's name so
[1:16:01] that the promise could be fulfilled
[1:16:03] Church we're not living before these
[1:16:05] things happen we're not looking oh my
[1:16:08] for God to appear to us we know he has
[1:16:10] appeared to us and we're sitting on the
[1:16:12] other side of
[1:16:14] that Hallelujah we already have the
[1:16:17] revelation of who Jesus
[1:16:19] is
[1:16:21] amen hallelujah Abraham was pondering
[1:16:24] those those things
[1:16:27] and he's sitting there in his tent door
[1:16:29] in the middle of the day suddenly he
[1:16:32] looks
[1:16:33] up there's three men walking in front of
[1:16:36] him brother brandham gives us a a very
[1:16:39] interesting detail yeah about those men
[1:16:43] whenever he tells the story he says they
[1:16:45] had dust on their clothes you ever
[1:16:47] notice that so those three men had dust
[1:16:49] on their clothes he said he kept looking
[1:16:52] down to them he said now these are
[1:16:53] strange fellas they're
[1:16:56] Dusty they traveled
[1:16:59] far again he said but when the hour of
[1:17:01] the message came he looked out in the
[1:17:02] heat of the day and he seen three men
[1:17:05] coming up dust all over their clothes
[1:17:07] and Abraham looked again he knew there
[1:17:09] was just something about it a real Born
[1:17:13] Again child of God knows the spirit of
[1:17:15] God when it strikes can you say Amen to
[1:17:16] that today said my sheep know my voice
[1:17:21] you see God when he needed a body as but
[1:17:24] the Sean said but Sean was getting real
[1:17:26] close to where I was going today God
[1:17:28] needed a body and he created himself a
[1:17:31] body out of
[1:17:33] dust but he didn't just create a body
[1:17:35] out of dust and then clothe him in Royal
[1:17:38] robes or or some kind of a Angelic
[1:17:41] garment or some kind of light where the
[1:17:43] people would know what it was where the
[1:17:45] denominations could see what it was and
[1:17:47] where everybody would recognize it but
[1:17:49] he came in such a way that only a man of
[1:17:53] Abraham's caliber of faith would be able
[1:17:55] to recognize who he was when he
[1:18:00] came so he come
[1:18:04] Elohim elai the the alls sufficient
[1:18:08] God the strength giver come down to
[1:18:11] visit
[1:18:13] Abraham and he had dust on his
[1:18:17] clothes God hiding himself in
[1:18:23] dust now look brother so when he set him
[1:18:25] down there though they didn't look any
[1:18:27] different from any other men because
[1:18:29] they were dressed dust on their clothes
[1:18:31] come from some other country probably
[1:18:33] their feet Dusty and their clothes
[1:18:36] ragged you realize God created those
[1:18:41] clothes Dusty on
[1:18:46] purpose
[1:18:48] right he could have come any way he
[1:18:50] wanted to he could have spoke to Abraham
[1:18:52] in a dream he could have spoke to him in
[1:18:54] a voice as he had before he could have
[1:18:56] spoke to him in a pillar of light he
[1:18:58] could have spoke to him any way he
[1:18:59] wanted to but he chose to come down in a
[1:19:02] man with dust on his clothes that looked
[1:19:06] like he was from another country and he
[1:19:08] was he was from
[1:19:10] heaven but he looked like he was from
[1:19:12] another Earthly
[1:19:14] country right now he said brother BR
[1:19:17] said Abraham knew inside there there was
[1:19:19] something real the spirit declared it
[1:19:21] why he kept himself in a spiritual
[1:19:23] atmosphere
[1:19:25] all the time that he could recognize
[1:19:28] right from wrong all the
[1:19:31] time listen young people you want to
[1:19:33] know the difference between right and
[1:19:35] wrong you say brother Ben I keep making
[1:19:36] mistakes and I mess up and I don't
[1:19:38] always do what I should don't you
[1:19:40] realize you need to get to a place where
[1:19:41] you begin to recognize right from wrong
[1:19:44] you you can't just have your dad tell
[1:19:46] you forever your mom tell you forever
[1:19:48] your pastor tell you forever you need to
[1:19:50] recognize right from wrome so the
[1:19:53] message doesn't just a list of things
[1:19:54] you do and don't do but it's something
[1:19:56] that's in your
[1:19:58] heart how do you recognize right from
[1:20:00] wrong there's only one way to recognize
[1:20:02] it and that's to be in his presence to
[1:20:05] fellowship with him if you fellowship
[1:20:08] with him you begin to realize right from
[1:20:10] wrong to recognize the difference
[1:20:12] because you kept yourself in a spiritual
[1:20:17] atmosphere you hang out at the pool hall
[1:20:20] long enough you won't be able to
[1:20:21] recognize right from wrong
[1:20:25] on you hang out on Facebook long enough
[1:20:27] and you won't be able to recognize right
[1:20:29] from
[1:20:31] wrong you hang around looking at other
[1:20:33] people and what they do long enough but
[1:20:35] don't do that get in a spiritual
[1:20:37] atmosphere and find out what God said
[1:20:39] about
[1:20:40] [Applause]
[1:20:43] it brother brandom just doesn't make up
[1:20:45] the idea they've got dust on their
[1:20:47] clothes we know they had dust on their
[1:20:50] feet right because what does Abraham say
[1:20:54] let me wash your
[1:20:57] feet let me wash your feet why they had
[1:20:59] dust on their feet they looked like
[1:21:02] they'd been on a
[1:21:04] journey and we find that when when God
[1:21:07] made himself a body as brother Sean said
[1:21:10] so eloquently in in the womb of Mary
[1:21:13] when he made himself that body what did
[1:21:15] he do he come on the earth and he walked
[1:21:17] as a man and when he did he got dust on
[1:21:20] his feet and there come a time where one
[1:21:23] of Abraham's seed had been caught up in
[1:21:25] prostitution and doing things she
[1:21:27] shouldn't have been doing and she was
[1:21:29] she was so far gone it seemed like there
[1:21:31] was no help for her but when she saw God
[1:21:34] walking with dust on his feet when she
[1:21:36] saw that God had made himself a body the
[1:21:39] Pharisee couldn't recognize it the other
[1:21:41] people couldn't recognize it but she
[1:21:44] recognized that God had made himself a
[1:21:46] body and was right there in front of her
[1:21:49] so what did she do she didn't stop she
[1:21:51] didn't let the PE other people quaten
[1:21:53] her down she said I don't care care what
[1:21:55] they do I'm going to worship God and she
[1:21:58] took what God give her brother BR said
[1:22:00] she didn't have the ability to go and
[1:22:02] wash his feet but God just used her hair
[1:22:04] in her tears God used her hair in her
[1:22:07] tears oh that he would use my tears
[1:22:09] today to wash his feet that he would use
[1:22:12] my praise today to wash his feet he
[1:22:15] still sits here with the desire to be
[1:22:17] worshiped brother BR said you invited
[1:22:19] him you called him then worship him when
[1:22:22] he comes
[1:22:25] Elohim with dust on his feet sitting in
[1:22:27] the corner waiting to be
[1:22:33] worshiped and the only one who
[1:22:35] recognized
[1:22:37] it was a prostitute I'm sure some of
[1:22:39] them looked at her they did and said
[1:22:42] look at her if he knew who she was but
[1:22:45] he did know who she
[1:22:48] was in the moment she took a step
[1:22:50] towards
[1:22:52] him Lord Jesus
[1:22:55] oh God I don't know where you come from
[1:22:57] this morning I don't know what you've
[1:22:58] been through I don't know what your past
[1:23:00] is or what your history is but the
[1:23:02] moment you take a step towards Jesus
[1:23:05] he's ready to receive your worship he's
[1:23:07] ready for you to get down in front of
[1:23:09] him and wash his feet all that we
[1:23:12] wouldn't forget how to do that
[1:23:18] church he came to
[1:23:20] Abraham not as a Celestial being but as
[1:23:24] a Dusty
[1:23:26] traveler he had on clothes like a man he
[1:23:30] said dust all over him come from a far
[1:23:34] country but Abraham saw
[1:23:37] God face to
[1:23:39] face this wasn't an angel but said it
[1:23:42] was
[1:23:43] Elohim dust was on his clothes the the
[1:23:45] flesh wasn't Elohim he just made himself
[1:23:47] a body but Elohim lived in that
[1:23:50] flesh see dust was on his clothes it
[1:23:53] wasn't extraordinary that dust would be
[1:23:55] there it was a desert
[1:23:57] country right if you walk very far
[1:23:59] you're going to get Dusty what was
[1:24:01] extraordinary about it is how ordinary
[1:24:03] it
[1:24:04] was see God has always come that way see
[1:24:08] and we find today we're faced with
[1:24:10] people and I just have to preach like
[1:24:11] like I can I I wish I could preach like
[1:24:13] these brothers
[1:24:15] but but God comes to us in a certain way
[1:24:18] and and we see people today said prove
[1:24:20] it or God didn't do
[1:24:22] it give us evidence so it didn't
[1:24:25] happen well the evidence in Abraham's
[1:24:29] case said that they were from a far
[1:24:31] Earthly country because of the
[1:24:35] Dust the dust seemed to be proof that
[1:24:39] they could not have come from Heaven if
[1:24:42] you looked at it with a critical mind if
[1:24:44] they had even come and told Abraham and
[1:24:46] said we come from Heaven which they
[1:24:48] didn't do he recognized who they were
[1:24:51] but if they had come and said we come
[1:24:53] from heaven and had this dust all over
[1:24:55] him and he was sitting there with a with
[1:24:56] a critical mind thinking like you you do
[1:24:59] after you visit some of these websites
[1:25:00] and you get to look into what people say
[1:25:02] about it and you begin to criticize
[1:25:04] everything a prophet said and and you
[1:25:06] begin to criticize every every miracle
[1:25:08] and everything say where's the proof of
[1:25:09] it where was the proof that that was God
[1:25:12] Abraham didn't wait for proof but he got
[1:25:14] down and said let me wash your feet let
[1:25:15] me make you welcome you got dust on your
[1:25:19] feet but I still believe despite the
[1:25:22] evidence I still believe
[1:25:25] hallah I'm going to wash that dust off
[1:25:28] I'm going to I'm going to clean it up I
[1:25:30] still believe in a message of the are
[1:25:32] you today I still believe that it's real
[1:25:35] I still believe he comes down and dwells
[1:25:37] Among Us I still believe he is Elohim in
[1:25:40] flesh
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:48] Hallelujah give me evidence where it
[1:25:50] didn't happen tell that to Abraham
[1:25:54] sad when that Spirit gets on
[1:25:57] preachers they did the same thing to
[1:26:00] Jesus said if you are who you say you
[1:26:02] are
[1:26:04] proven God proves his word by bringing
[1:26:06] it to pass but he don't have to bring it
[1:26:09] to pass the way you think he's going to
[1:26:10] bring it to
[1:26:13] pass all the evidence showed these Dusty
[1:26:16] Travelers didn't come from Heaven they
[1:26:18] traveled from somewhere on Earth because
[1:26:20] dust is evidence of Earth
[1:26:25] hurt oh
[1:26:28] my was God hiding himself in the dust in
[1:26:31] Abraham because of who he
[1:26:34] was because he was elected by God and
[1:26:38] God put a faith in him that would
[1:26:39] believe he calls out and he says my
[1:26:42] Lord he doesn't say my lord it's like
[1:26:44] lot did he said my
[1:26:47] Lord Brother Brandon said watch the
[1:26:49] effect of the revelation of who God was
[1:26:51] had upon Abraham what it did to him
[1:26:55] after his name was changed from Abram to
[1:26:58] Abraham he seen three men coming and he
[1:27:01] called the three one my Lord he called
[1:27:05] the three one my Lord Abraham's vision
[1:27:08] and Revelation showed him that he was
[1:27:10] the alls sufficient Elohim and brother
[1:27:13] Bron said his seed is to receive the
[1:27:15] same thing he said we're made out of 16
[1:27:18] elements petroleum Cosmic light potash

[1:27:35] of Father though the skin worms destroy
[1:27:38] this body yet he'll call you he promised
[1:27:41] he'll do it he is
[1:27:43] Elohim he said in Abraham after the
[1:27:45] Revelation he seen it he knew there was
[1:27:46] one God and he seen it he said my Lord
[1:27:49] come aside sit down let me wash your
[1:27:53] feet

[1:28:01] life here we're made of 16 different
[1:28:03] elements of the earth and he said that

[1:30:46] get
[1:30:49] nervous these bodies are just dust

[1:30:55] mistakes we worry when we
[1:31:00] shouldn't we do all kinds of stuff we
[1:31:02] shouldn't do not willfully but it's just
[1:31:04] something about the Dust but but God
[1:31:07] veiled himself in
[1:31:09] dust oh my listen when God did in this
[1:31:13] age when he came down and showed himself
[1:31:16] in a prophet wave that before us what
[1:31:19] did he do he he he he come in such a way
[1:31:22] that the people didn't recognize him yet
[1:31:24] Jesus said about John he said what went
[1:31:26] you out for to
[1:31:27] see a prophet John came with dust on his
[1:31:31] clothes come out of the Wilderness with
[1:31:33] camel hair and eating eating wild locust
[1:31:36] and honey but what did he say what went
[1:31:38] you out to see what did you go to see a
[1:31:41] prophet I say to you more than a
[1:31:45] Prophet this is the
[1:31:47] Forerunner he went out there and said
[1:31:49] there's something about that man I've
[1:31:50] heard that voice before Abraham again he
[1:31:52] said I know he's got dust all over his
[1:31:55] clothes he's sitting there rubbing his
[1:31:57] face brother Bron's face would get numb
[1:31:59] when he was in under the anointing and
[1:32:02] he would rub his face and he was saying
[1:32:04] he here was this Elohim here was God
[1:32:06] wrapped in flesh sitting there rubbing
[1:32:07] his face looking around like that but
[1:32:10] I'm telling you I know that voice cuz it
[1:32:13] ain't an uncertain sound cuz I heard it
[1:32:16] 25 years ago and honey we've been
[1:32:18] trusted all this time to believe you
[1:32:20] didn't just hear a voice on the tape But
[1:32:22] You Heard a Voice from Heaven A
[1:32:24] predestination that spoke to
[1:32:27] you and it tells me this message is
[1:32:30] right they can find all the dust they
[1:32:32] want to find they can sweep it all
[1:32:34] together and do whatever they want to
[1:32:36] with it and try to prove all they want
[1:32:37] to prove I see God moving in my
[1:32:42] generation glory to

[1:33:19] heard it 25 years ago he's speaking to
[1:33:21] Sarah said honey we've been trusted all
[1:33:23] this time to believe and there's
[1:33:26] something about that
[1:33:28] man I don't know why but there's
[1:33:30] something about him I
[1:33:34] believe I
[1:33:37] believe I got to look past the dust on
[1:33:40] his clothes see
[1:33:44] him oh my I wonder if we can do that
[1:33:46] with one
[1:33:50] another look see I went I was at brother
[1:33:55] Brand's grave the other day we were in
[1:33:56] Jeffersonville for a funeral and I
[1:33:58] walked by his grave and that's what I
[1:34:00] began to think about the dust and kind
[1:34:02] of what inspired that and I preached
[1:34:03] that at home about the Dust on his
[1:34:05] clothes and I I was walking by there and
[1:34:07] there was it was it was very dusty it
[1:34:09] was dry it was dust on the dust on the
[1:34:12] tomb and drove by the Tabernacle was
[1:34:13] dust all over the Tabernacle the outside
[1:34:15] and I thought oh God it just feels so
[1:34:18] empty it feels like there's just not the
[1:34:21] excitement that there was when I was a
[1:34:22] child but when I got to thinking about
[1:34:24] it I thought God you're still here
[1:34:27] you're still the same yesterday today
[1:34:28] and forever that dust may have been put
[1:34:31] back in the ground but you didn't die in
[1:34:33] a grave in Jeffersonville but you're the
[1:34:35] same in Pony Oklahoma at the meetings it
[1:34:38] doesn't matter what's going on around
[1:34:40] you he's still the same your favorite
[1:34:43] preacher may not be here but Elohim is
[1:34:45] here it may not whole church you may not
[1:34:48] your friend that wanted to come may not
[1:34:50] have been able to come but Elohim is
[1:34:52] here we ought to worship him while he
[1:34:53] here we ought to give him what he
[1:34:55] deserves we ought to worship him like we
[1:34:57] never have before I don't need a
[1:34:59] thousand people to worship God all I
[1:35:01] need is Elohim all I need is a
[1:35:03] revelation to know what he's done for me
[1:35:06] to thank him for his goodness in my
[1:35:10] life glory to
[1:35:13] God hallelujah he's he's still here that
[1:35:17] same one who use that body to open up
[1:35:19] the Seven Seals the same one to do signs
[1:35:22] and wonders that same God who used that
[1:35:24] body to reveal the secrets of the heart
[1:35:26] is right here in py Oklahoma this
[1:35:29] [Applause]
[1:35:33] morning the brown said friends don't
[1:35:35] look to me I'm your brother don't pay no
[1:35:38] attention to me because I'm just a
[1:35:39] mortal I have to die like everybody else
[1:35:43] don't you listen to me but listen to
[1:35:44] what I've
[1:35:46] said what I said is the message don't
[1:35:49] pay any attention to the messenger watch
[1:35:52] the message
[1:35:54] keep your eyes not on the messenger but
[1:35:56] on the message what it said that's the
[1:35:58] thing to look to he said it wasn't the
[1:35:59] angel his message it was the mystery
[1:36:01] that God unfolded it's not a man it's
[1:36:03] God the angel was not the son of man he
[1:36:05] was the messenger from the son of man
[1:36:08] the son of man is Christ he's the one
[1:36:11] that you're feeding on then if we're
[1:36:13] still feeding on him he's still here
[1:36:16] you're not feeding on a man a man his
[1:36:17] words will fail but you're feeding on
[1:36:19] the unfailing body word of the son of
[1:36:22] man you say I've heard that before but
[1:36:24] have you ever heard it and been able to
[1:36:25] look past the dust and see what you're
[1:36:27] doing when you're sitting in the house
[1:36:29] of
[1:36:31] God we think way too
[1:36:36] small I don't believe I believe every
[1:36:38] service ought to be a Revival we may not
[1:36:41] be turning over pews and shouting and
[1:36:43] running but every service ought to be a
[1:36:47] Revival cuz the Revival is in me the
[1:36:50] Revival's in you
[1:36:55] Abraham he said I want you to feel
[1:36:57] welcome he said so he said I want you to
[1:37:01] cook you a meal he had a desire to make
[1:37:04] them welcome he said let a little water
[1:37:06] I pray you be fetched and wash your feet
[1:37:09] rest yourselves under the tree and I'll
[1:37:11] fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you
[1:37:13] your hearts after that you shall pass on
[1:37:16] for for therefore are you come to your
[1:37:19] servant now look at his attitude towards
[1:37:22] worship it's Lord you came to me for me
[1:37:26] to bless
[1:37:28] you that's different is't it you came to
[1:37:31] me for me to bless you you came to me
[1:37:35] and God did come to bless Abraham but
[1:37:37] Abraham's attitude was let me bless
[1:37:41] you let me wash the dust from your
[1:37:45] feet and Abraham hastened into the tent
[1:37:48] unto Sarah and said make ready quickly
[1:37:51] three measures of fine meal need it
[1:37:53] cakes upon the Earth fine meal on the
[1:37:55] earth fine meal was reserved for Kings
[1:37:58] the best of the
[1:38:01] best and Abraham ran to the herd he
[1:38:05] didn't kind of Mosey his
[1:38:08] way right Abraham become a Pentecostal
[1:38:11] preacher that
[1:38:13] morning and ran to the
[1:38:16] herd and when he got out there he didn't
[1:38:18] find the old Walmart
[1:38:20] cow y'all from Oklahoma you know what
[1:38:22] I'm talking about
[1:38:23] he didn't find the old one that was
[1:38:25] barely broken down I remember we had a
[1:38:26] cow one time that we had to give her a
[1:38:28] bottle of sugar water before she'd get
[1:38:30] in the trailer she was down before she
[1:38:32] got in that trailer and that sugar water
[1:38:34] kept her up till she went through the
[1:38:35] ring and she sold and she collapsed on
[1:38:37] the other side I didn't do that my
[1:38:39] family
[1:38:43] did but that's not the kind of cow not
[1:38:46] the kind of calf that Abraham went
[1:38:47] looking for he didn't come looking for
[1:38:50] some old some old halfway religion he
[1:38:52] didn't come looking for some old meal
[1:38:54] that had been warmed up and he got off
[1:38:56] the internet somewhere he didn't go
[1:38:57] looking down the street for what the
[1:38:59] other preachers were preaching what was
[1:39:00] he looking for he was looking for a calf
[1:39:03] tender and good something that Elohim
[1:39:06] would be welcome would would want to eat
[1:39:08] from amen oh that's what I want to give
[1:39:10] him this morning I want to give him my
[1:39:12] best give him my
[1:39:13] all Hallelujah he took butter and milk
[1:39:16] in the calf what you addressed and set
[1:39:18] it before them and he stood by them
[1:39:20] under the tree and they did eat
[1:39:25] he stood there brother brand said with a
[1:39:26] fly
[1:39:28] bush kept the Flies
[1:39:31] off you know church we don't realize
[1:39:34] what we do when we're in the house of
[1:39:37] God you matter when you show
[1:39:41] up come on Church they well it's
[1:39:44] Wednesday night they won't miss me you
[1:39:45] matter when you show
[1:39:48] up cuz somebody's got to stand
[1:39:52] there chew the flies
[1:39:58] away somebody's got to do it now as far
[1:40:02] as we know this was the first time that
[1:40:05] Elohim ever tasted human
[1:40:08] food but it wouldn't be his
[1:40:11] last he come down to the body and said
[1:40:13] let let's have a meal I like a god like
[1:40:16] that
[1:40:23] we've been having potlucks ever
[1:40:29] since the Baptist didn't invent the
[1:40:31] potluck Elohim came down for the first
[1:40:35] potluck wonder what Abraham will have
[1:40:37] bet it'll be good because Abraham always
[1:40:39] gives his
[1:40:40] best Abraham's got a
[1:40:44] revelation
[1:40:46] Hallelujah he was hungry for Fellowship
[1:40:48] why did it why did God come down why
[1:40:50] couldn't he just say it why couldn't he
[1:40:51] just send a letter
[1:40:53] put on audio recording send it to
[1:40:56] him he didn't do that what did he do he
[1:40:59] came
[1:41:02] down he invited himself to Abraham's
[1:41:05] house for a
[1:41:07] meal see my brother B I don't my house
[1:41:10] is humble I live in a little old
[1:41:12] Oklahoma Shack or Missouri Shack or
[1:41:15] Arkansas Shack and I it's so humble I I
[1:41:18] don't think Elohim would want to eat
[1:41:19] there you think he'd want he's already
[1:41:21] invited himself
[1:41:23] what did he say he said behold I stand
[1:41:25] at the door and
[1:41:29] knock he did that to the age and the age
[1:41:32] left him outside what a pitiful sight to
[1:41:34] see Jesus standing outside of a Le to
[1:41:37] see an age they were singing they were
[1:41:39] dancing they were carrying on they
[1:41:41] forming denominations they were saying
[1:41:42] God is still with us but he was outside
[1:41:45] knocking on the door but there's been a
[1:41:47] people in this age that accepted his
[1:41:49] invitation he not only wants to come to
[1:41:51] you he has come in in this
[1:41:54] age he said I stand and knock if you
[1:41:58] hear my voice and open the door I will
[1:42:00] come in and will'll Su with him and he
[1:42:02] with me that word Su is the evening meal
[1:42:05] what Abraham should have been preparing
[1:42:06] due to the time of day was the afternoon
[1:42:08] Meal which was a light snack but he
[1:42:10] didn't give that to
[1:42:12] Elohim praise
[1:42:15] God he didn't just give him a few nuts
[1:42:17] and some some beef
[1:42:21] jerky that was
[1:42:23] that's good he didn't just give him that
[1:42:27] but what did he give
[1:42:28] him come on church he gave him the
[1:42:31] evening meal in the middle of the day
[1:42:34] because the evening meal is the time
[1:42:36] they would all sit down and they'd have
[1:42:37] a conversation and that's what Elohim
[1:42:40] came to do he didn't come just for a
[1:42:42] drive-thru snack he didn't come to go to
[1:42:44] McDonald's he didn't come to go to
[1:42:46] denomination he didn't come to go and
[1:42:48] hear a little 10cent preacher or
[1:42:50] somebody can't can't study and doesn't
[1:42:52] know nothing about God he come to get a
[1:42:55] meal and I think every time we we go to
[1:42:58] church we ought to offer it up to
[1:43:01] God he said if you'll open the door I'll
[1:43:04] come in and have a full me meal a seven
[1:43:07] course
[1:43:09] meal
[1:43:12] you you guys are wearing me out standing
[1:43:15] up I like it
[1:43:20] though before his crucifixion he sat
[1:43:23] down with his
[1:43:25] disciples he told him he said I want to
[1:43:27] have a meal am I taking too long
[1:43:30] I I'm just brother brother you can get
[1:43:34] the rest of it
[1:43:36] later Abraham Lincoln can preach the
[1:43:38] rest later forgot his
[1:43:48] name he sat down before his crucifixion
[1:43:50] he said with desire I have desired
[1:43:55] I have a brother named Jonathan too
[1:43:56] that's
[1:43:58] terrible with desire have I desired to
[1:44:01] eat this Passover with you before I
[1:44:03] suffer for I say unto you I will not any
[1:44:07] more eat thereof until I love that
[1:44:09] that's in there until it be fulfilled in
[1:44:12] the kingdom of God he was so hungry for
[1:44:14] their Fellowship we don't know if that
[1:44:15] meal was good or bad we don't know what
[1:44:18] it tasted like when he sat down with
[1:44:21] them for that supper but he said I want
[1:44:22] to eat with you did he want to eat with
[1:44:23] him it wasn't about the food it was
[1:44:25] about the
[1:44:28] fellowship he wanted to talk to
[1:44:32] him the same day he rose he made himself
[1:44:34] another body ate dinner with two of them
[1:44:38] again they didn't recognize him how he
[1:44:41] came to them however that was Luke 24:28
[1:44:43] they Dro DW nigh into the village
[1:44:45] whether they went he made as though he
[1:44:46] would have gone further but they
[1:44:49] constrained him remember they had walked
[1:44:51] with him down 6-hour Journey journey and
[1:44:53] he'd preached a six hour sermon said and
[1:44:55] started it like this can you imagine if
[1:44:56] your pastor walked out he said oh
[1:45:01] fools it's his first
[1:45:06] words brother Miguel could see him doing
[1:45:08] that old fools and slow of
[1:45:12] heart to believe all that the sometimes
[1:45:15] we need to be talked to like that don't
[1:45:16] we all fools and so
[1:45:19] heart it's like he's trying to wake them
[1:45:22] up you know
[1:45:23] shock him a little
[1:45:25] bit give him a six-hour sermon he gets
[1:45:28] down to the end of it and they want him
[1:45:30] to preach
[1:45:35] longer we're not going to do that
[1:45:39] today he made as though he would pass on
[1:45:42] like a just a Dusty
[1:45:45] traveler but they they constrained him
[1:45:48] said abide with us for it is toward
[1:45:51] evening and the day is far spent oh come
[1:45:54] on Hallelujah he went in to Terry with
[1:45:57] them for the evening meal but BR said
[1:45:59] they was talking to him didn't know it
[1:46:01] so no doubt he said he looked at them
[1:46:03] sadly wonder how he looks at us today
[1:46:06] when we're in such a hurry to just get
[1:46:08] through it oh it's just another meeting
[1:46:11] I've done my duty I've done I've worked
[1:46:13] in the kitchen I I've taken care of my
[1:46:16] children I've watched the young people I
[1:46:18] I'm I'm half wore out anyway uh maybe if
[1:46:21] he just go on it'd be best but no he
[1:46:23] looks at you sadly and he wants to come
[1:46:25] in he wants to do something for you he
[1:46:27] wants to show you who he is he wants to
[1:46:29] give you something that'll that'll be
[1:46:31] worth all the effort that you put into
[1:46:34] it well I maybe he just pass on but they
[1:46:38] constrained him to stay he started to
[1:46:40] walk on by but he was waiting for them
[1:46:42] to invite him he said that's what he's
[1:46:44] waiting tonight for you to invite him
[1:46:46] notice when those disciples invited him
[1:46:48] into their Fellowship around the table
[1:46:49] it was then he done something like he
[1:46:51] did before his crucifixion their eyes
[1:46:53] come open he said they knowed his manner
[1:46:55] his
[1:46:56] style hallelujah how did they know that
[1:46:59] they'd fellowship with him
[1:47:02] before he said they knew what he done he
[1:47:04] did it then just like he did before and
[1:47:06] they said that's him and quickly they
[1:47:08] raised up to scream it out and he
[1:47:10] vanished they recognized him because
[1:47:13] they had fellowship with him before the
[1:47:14] reason we don't recognize him in church
[1:47:16] many times is because we don't
[1:47:17] Fellowship much outside of church
[1:47:23] the reason you sit there like a like a
[1:47:25] bump on a pickle has been said huh you
[1:47:28] sit there like that because you you you
[1:47:30] you've been almost always so listen to
[1:47:32] me church it's almost always because not
[1:47:35] because the church is dead you said well
[1:47:36] if the preacher would preach like he
[1:47:38] used to if the church was like it used
[1:47:39] to be no the real problem is because we
[1:47:42] haven't been fellowshipping like we used
[1:47:44] to we've not been getting down on our
[1:47:46] knees and calling out to God like we
[1:47:48] used to
[1:47:57] Hallelujah you know what I want to eat
[1:48:00] with him
[1:48:03] again you know I know people
[1:48:05] spiritualize things but I want to sit
[1:48:06] down across a
[1:48:09] table and eat with him just let me hold
[1:48:11] on to that promise you spiritualize
[1:48:13] something
[1:48:16] else let me sit down there brother
[1:48:18] Matthew and eat a meal with Jesus
[1:48:22] the disciples did like Abraham did I
[1:48:27] fellowship with him in the word I
[1:48:29] fellowship with him here in the meeting
[1:48:30] I fellowship with him at the church I
[1:48:32] fellowship with him in my closet but one
[1:48:33] day there's a heart's desire to
[1:48:36] fellowship with him again after I meet
[1:48:38] my loved ones after I see them after we
[1:48:41] have a grand reunion let me fellowship
[1:48:43] with him face to face said brother Ben
[1:48:45] how does that work logistically I don't
[1:48:50] care just want to sit down with him
[1:48:54] [Applause]
[1:48:56] brother Brandon said when the bride is
[1:48:57] called out and elected and set in The
[1:48:58] Book of Life there will come a sound
[1:48:59] from Heaven it'll take such a baptism of
[1:49:01] the Holy Spirit into that bride you know
[1:49:03] the quote it'll take her from the earth
[1:49:04] in a rapturing Grace he said there is a
[1:49:06] heaven and there is a literal Jesus
[1:49:08] Christ that will come in a body form to
[1:49:10] receive his church to himself no matter
[1:49:12] how old the story seems it's still the
[1:49:15] truth God said so how many Believers we
[1:49:17] got in here today he said that's what
[1:49:19] Believers believe
[1:49:25] after Abraham invited him in made him
[1:49:27] welcome wash the dirt off of
[1:49:31] him after that meal he's done cheing all
[1:49:35] the flies away they sit down and begin
[1:49:37] to
[1:49:39] talk and they said unto him where is
[1:49:41] Sarah thy wife called her by her
[1:49:44] princess name brother brand said he said
[1:49:47] behold in the
[1:49:49] tent he said' I will certainly return
[1:49:51] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:49:55] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[1:49:58] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[1:50:00] which was behind him now look he had his
[1:50:04] back literally to the
[1:50:08] audience he was talking for Sarah's
[1:50:12] benefit knowing she was there and she
[1:50:14] could hear him with his back turned to
[1:50:16] her called her by name this is important
[1:50:20] because this happened in our day
[1:50:24] God showed us that oh my this wasn't
[1:50:26] just a story but he did it in our day in
[1:50:30] fact the Bible tells us that as brother
[1:50:32] Sean has already even thus shall it be
[1:50:34] in the day when the son of man is
[1:50:35] revealed there would be a revealing of
[1:50:36] the son of man there would be a sign a
[1:50:38] messiah sign something that would be
[1:50:40] done that would show us that he was
[1:50:41] still alive he was still the same
[1:50:43] yesterday today and forever and in
[1:50:45] hundreds of places and hundreds of cases
[1:50:47] at hundreds of times he called out
[1:50:49] people with prayer cards without prayer
[1:50:51] cards at the front of the house at the
[1:50:53] back of the house wherever else they
[1:50:54] were sitting and he did it over and over
[1:50:56] and over again what was it not a man
[1:50:59] we're not elevating a man it was God in
[1:51:04] flesh Hallelujah and brother R said each
[1:51:08] night I've been turning my back to the
[1:51:11] audience that you might
[1:51:14] know and God to vindicate how he said
[1:51:16] how many knows that Jesus said as it was
[1:51:18] in the days of Sodom so shall it be in
[1:51:21] the coming of the son of man listen to
[1:51:22] me young people this isn't just stories
[1:51:24] it really
[1:51:28] happened you can hear on tape you can
[1:51:30] watch it on deep call to the Deep you
[1:51:31] can ask brother
[1:51:39] Kenny he said just that you might know
[1:51:42] I'm going to turn my back to the
[1:51:44] audience he said now remember when I do
[1:51:46] this don't let me get letters saying
[1:51:48] brother brandom you called yourself that
[1:51:49] angel said that's wrong I'm a sinner
[1:51:51] saved by the grace of Christ no matter
[1:51:54] what I did no matter how much God
[1:51:55] anointed me if you wasn't anointed also
[1:51:56] it wouldn't work it's your faith that
[1:51:59] does it this is just a gift just to pull
[1:52:02] a lever back far enough that's the
[1:52:05] problem isn't
[1:52:07] it some of us just have a little bit
[1:52:09] harder time pulling that
[1:52:13] lever that old lever gets Rusty you got
[1:52:16] to put some oil of the Holy Ghost on it
[1:52:19] and pull that lever back he said to let
[1:52:22] William br him step off the scene so
[1:52:24] Jesus Christ can work he said now you
[1:52:26] pull your lever
[1:52:28] back far enough so you can get off the
[1:52:31] scene oh how many say I want to do that
[1:52:33] today let me pull my lever back so that
[1:52:35] whatever God has placed in my life I can
[1:52:38] be that I can do that Jesus Christ can
[1:52:41] work brother brandom in Jehovah Gyra
[1:52:43] number two and I'm hurrying to close
[1:52:45] brandom keeps ATT tempting to turn his
[1:52:47] back to the audience he just he just
[1:52:49] keeps turning around and in that c if
[1:52:52] you go listen to it they interrupted him
[1:52:54] 10
[1:52:55] times with with gifts of tongues and
[1:52:57] things we believe in tongues we believe
[1:52:59] in interpretation we we believe in
[1:53:01] Prophecy but it was out of
[1:53:03] order and they and the way they did it
[1:53:06] you tell they didn't recognize what God
[1:53:07] was
[1:53:08] doing they just didn't see it yeah here
[1:53:12] God was was trying to show them I'm with
[1:53:14] you I'm here and they could have all
[1:53:16] been healed they could have all been
[1:53:18] delivered but they were sitting there
[1:53:20] over and over and over again they
[1:53:21] interrupted yeah he said I'm going to
[1:53:23] turn my back and here they
[1:53:28] go finally gets his chance the last one
[1:53:32] finishes up he turns his back he said
[1:53:35] there's someone standing before me which
[1:53:36] sits behind
[1:53:38] me oh my it's a Woman She's suffering
[1:53:41] with a heart trouble she has allergies
[1:53:42] that's bothering her she's just behind
[1:53:45] me you think that God still knows that
[1:53:47] about you
[1:53:49] today he may not have a prophet here
[1:53:52] that could reveal the secrets of the
[1:53:53] heart but he still knows that about you
[1:53:56] and he wants you to believe his
[1:53:58] word you are
[1:54:00] healed he said she's also concerned
[1:54:03] about a loved one her husband sitting
[1:54:04] from her he's he's paralyzed has a cane
[1:54:06] the woman's name is Mrs
[1:54:09] Brumley he's got his back to the
[1:54:12] audience you know that makes me
[1:54:14] nervous you ever tried to preach with
[1:54:16] your back to the audience it's hard
[1:54:18] enough to preach with your face to the
[1:54:19] audience
[1:54:23] but it makes me nervous when I turn
[1:54:24] around because you can't see how people
[1:54:25] are
[1:54:27] reacting but brother Brandon wasn't
[1:54:28] nervous he knew what God was
[1:54:31] doing yet is back to the audience Oh my
[1:54:35] he said now he said believe with all
[1:54:37] your heart stand up and accept what you
[1:54:39] prayed for you'll get what you asked for
[1:54:41] he said now that ain't the same God that
[1:54:43] was down there just before Sodom I don't
[1:54:45] know what
[1:54:47] is that's Elijah right there
[1:54:52] I hope it strengthens your faith
[1:54:55] today but that was even that in in the
[1:54:58] greatness that that was but BR talks
[1:55:00] about that about the second poll of his
[1:55:01] ministry you remember the third poll was
[1:55:03] the opening of the word
[1:55:06] right and brother brandom taught us that
[1:55:08] the opening of the word was far greater
[1:55:10] than the rest of them
[1:55:12] combined what he thought his new
[1:55:14] ministry would be would be far greater
[1:55:16] than the rest of them combined he said
[1:55:18] he talks about Visions he said now
[1:55:19] that's God speaking in this day through
[1:55:21] vision he said but this this if that
[1:55:22] Vision was contrary to this that would
[1:55:25] be wrong this is more than the vision
[1:55:28] that's right if you got your Bible with
[1:55:30] you hold it up if you got your Bible
[1:55:33] hold it up you've got something
[1:55:37] [Music]
[1:55:39] more than a vision are you with me now
[1:55:43] more than a vision if I come to you and
[1:55:45] I told you what your name was and I was
[1:55:47] exactly right and I saw a vision about
[1:55:49] you but you got something greater than
[1:55:50] that what does it tell you you're a
[1:55:52] child of God you're a Seed of Abraham
[1:55:54] you belong in the house of God it tells
[1:55:56] you to assemble yourselves together it
[1:55:58] tells you you've been healed by his
[1:56:00] stripes I've been
[1:56:01] healed oh church do you realize that all
[1:56:04] that we have come cuz God there was an
[1:56:07] open Vision on the earth there was an
[1:56:09] open Vision but if God could do that
[1:56:11] through an open Vision how much more
[1:56:13] could he do through an open
[1:56:15] book Glory if the book was greater than
[1:56:19] the vision look what he did with an open
[1:56:20] Vision through a prophet how much more
[1:56:22] can you do through an open book in your
[1:56:24] life and you can stand and accept it
[1:56:26] today I'm Healed I've been
[1:56:29] [Applause]
[1:56:31] delivered glory to God he showed us he
[1:56:33] was here to do it we just got to believe
[1:56:40] it this message isn't buried in
[1:56:48] Jeffersonville I don't know may be my
[1:56:50] last time ever preached to you I don't
[1:56:51] know none of us
[1:56:54] know look at this the Bible tells if any
[1:56:58] man shall say to you Lo here is Christ

[1:57:51] hearts of the children back to the faith
[1:57:52] of the fathers and in there there would

[1:58:52] [Applause]
[1:58:54] he goes on to say they were anointed by
[1:58:56] accepting what 've turned
[1:58:58] down glory to God what do we need to do
[1:59:02] brother B to be anointed we need to
[1:59:03] preach the word believe the word live
[1:59:06] the
[1:59:12] word the Sean I think quoted this from
[1:59:14] memory last night he said the bridegroom
[1:59:16] call will come right through this the
[1:59:18] son of man will come down and come in
[1:59:20] human flesh to unite the two together
[1:59:24] the church has to be the word he is the
[1:59:27] word and the two unites together and to
[1:59:29] do that'll take the manifestation of the
[1:59:31] revealing of the son of man he goes on
[1:59:32] to say we're married here we go to the
[1:59:34] wedding supper he said when the word
[1:59:36] here unites with the person and they two
[1:59:37] become one then what does it do then it
[1:59:39] manifests the son of man again not the
[1:59:42] church theologians the son of man the
[1:59:44] word and the church become one whatever
[1:59:47] the son of man done he was the word the
[1:59:49] church does the same thing
[1:59:54] God could only reveal himself in a
[1:59:56] prophet in a prophetic form now he
[2:00:00] reveals himself in a bride in a Min
[2:00:02] membered bride I don't need God to come
[2:00:04] back and ever do that again well random
[2:00:08] tells us one time was
[2:00:11] enough they should have believed when
[2:00:13] they saw it once and yet God was
[2:00:16] gracious to his merciful he sent angels
[2:00:18] of Mercy aren't you glad he did angels
[2:00:21] of Mercy to Abraham and he come down
[2:00:23] over and over and over
[2:00:25] again but I want him to reveal himself
[2:00:27] in my life reveal him that's why I don't
[2:00:30] want to be more than what I am I may
[2:00:33] never be a great preacher but Lord if
[2:00:34] you can reveal yourself to me through me
[2:00:37] to my church Lord would you do that let
[2:00:39] let me not be benr it anymore let it be
[2:00:41] the son of man this message revealed in
[2:00:43] me oh would you say Amen to that today
[2:00:46] let it be the son of man revealed in
[2:00:48] Factory workers and and teachers and
[2:00:50] Housewives
[2:00:54] brother Brandon said Jesus was God in
[2:00:55] flesh and if Jesus is in you tonight is
[2:00:58] still God manifest himself in the last
[2:01:00] days the son of man revealing himself in
[2:01:02] his church the human flesh making
[2:01:04] himself known he said God come down here
[2:01:07] in his church making himself again the
[2:01:09] word the son of man being revealed in
[2:01:10] the last days as it was in the days of
[2:01:12] Sodom I'm closing with this he said I
[2:01:14] challenge you to believe
[2:01:23] we're going to accept the challenge some
[2:01:26] of you boys if somebody challenged you
[2:01:27] to a wrestling match you'd accept
[2:01:32] it I wouldn't because I'd get my leg
[2:01:36] broke although size is an
[2:01:41] advantage somebody challenge you to a
[2:01:42] hot dog eating contest you'd take
[2:01:47] it somebody challenged you to whatever
[2:01:50] it is they want to challenge you you'd
[2:01:51] be up for the the challenge but what did
[2:01:53] the prophet of God said I challenge you
[2:01:55] to
[2:01:58] believe that's the challenge this
[2:02:00] morning do you believe whether you
[2:02:02] believe or not will reflect in your life
[2:02:04] it'll reflect in your everyday life
[2:02:05] it'll reflect in your church life it'll
[2:02:07] reflect when you go to the house of God
[2:02:09] it'll reflect on your face when you
[2:02:10] listen to the preaching it'll reflect to
[2:02:12] the to your pastor and how you quit
[2:02:14] criticizing and how you you start
[2:02:16] encouraging the work it'll reflect in
[2:02:17] what you do it'll be that let me be the
[2:02:20] son of man to my church to my
[2:02:23] area I realize the most important thing
[2:02:25] that I am is to be to be the person God
[2:02:28] called me to be not even just to be a
[2:02:31] pastor but to be Ben prit that God had
[2:02:33] his name my name on his book before the
[2:02:35] foundation of the
[2:02:37] earth that he would manifest
[2:02:40] himself my life and Colby Martin's life
[2:02:43] and his other brothers life these other
[2:02:47] sisters
[2:02:50] lives you don't need a new church
[2:02:52] Church a new
[2:02:54] pastor come on Church a new
[2:02:59] tape you need to believe what you
[2:03:06] got you need to believe that Jesus
[2:03:08] Christ who is Elohim
[2:03:10] himself is revealed in the form of the
[2:03:12] son of man in human flesh through your
[2:03:18] body Hallelujah musicians would you come
[2:03:22] would you make him welcome with your

[2:03:36] that I the altar is open if you need to
[2:03:38] pray I still believe in an
[2:03:40] altar if I was a young person I was
[2:03:42] struggling with something I believe I'd
[2:03:44] be at the altar crying out to God God
[2:03:47] God I want to be clean I want to be
[2:03:49] right if I was an older person got cold
[2:03:52] and crusty and indifferent believe I'd
[2:03:54] be at the altar ready to receive
[2:03:56] something from God but but you know this
[2:03:58] place doesn't mean anything only
[2:04:00] surrender sometimes we have to surrender
[2:04:02] ourselves and come here because that's
[2:04:03] what God wants us to do but God can
[2:04:05] speak to you right there in your
[2:04:07] seat and I just want you to make him
[2:04:09] welcome would you do that would you
