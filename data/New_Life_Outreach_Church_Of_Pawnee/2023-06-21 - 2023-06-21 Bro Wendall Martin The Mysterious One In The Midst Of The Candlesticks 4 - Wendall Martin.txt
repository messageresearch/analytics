Weston and I hope you all enjoy yourself here this evening it's good to be here tonight now on a Wednesday night praise the lord well if you have your Bibles let's um let's go ahead and get into our study here this evening and we're going to look here in in the Book of Revelations the first chapter and um we're going to start right there at the 13th verse and going down on some of these we've been dealing with the seven-fold personage of Christ and um so I think we're we're going to start here tonight on The Voice of the sound of many Waters and we we left off last week his feet like under brass but we're just gonna we're gonna start here at the 13th verse in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot gird about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hair was white like wool as white as snow his eyes were as flame of fire his feet likened to Brass as if they burned in a furnace his voice as the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I Am Alive forevermore amen and have the geese of hell and of death praise the Lord let's go to the Lord in prayer father we just want to thank you tonight for your your many blessings that you have given us thank you for your grace Upon Our Lives and we're just asking the Lord that you would be Among Us Lord in our in our study here tonight Lord in a real special way I know the Lord people are tired and and these mid weeks Lord can uh everyone comes to church tired but Lord your presence we feel your presence here and we're just asking Lord that we would the Lord that you would stir us up with the stimulation of Revelation Lord and let your word be be real and Rich to us here this evening and we'll give you glory and honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen it's good to see Maya here uh today I uh she she sprang her wrist really bad and so we've been praying for her and um how many loves Amaya [Applause] amen you Fellers on the front row might as well come right on over here so y'all can see the chalkboard or not the chalkboard but the dry eraser board amen might end up over there tonight and that matters of fact it would probably be a good idea for everyone over there in that section on these Wednesday nights so you can you can see but we this mysterious one walking in the midst of the candlesticks we see we have been going through the Sevenfold personage of Christ and we have been dealing with the with the um uh the revelation of God this is this is dealing with the deity of Jesus Christ that that Jesus was the body that God created now amen it's hard for trinitarians to see that but you cannot you cannot go from the Old Testament of the Lord our God is one God and then come into the New Testament and say the Lord our God is three there are not three it's one God in three offices amen and so people will walk away from you just right now they'll just say all right that's all we can and Trinity is not even in the Bible Trinity was never mentioned in the Bible but you see it's it's a it it's Catholic dogma amen that that was brought in in uh A.D 325 at the nice end Council this is when they introduced and I want to say Amen the Catholics weren't the first to come up with three gods amen hey that came all the way from Babylon we're talking about thousands of years they worship amen uh the sun god the son had a mother there there was an old man I mean this is you can go back and look look in his lips to Babylons and you'll find out amen that the Catholic church and what they brought in was they they just erased they just erased Jupiter's name and and put a saying in there that that was that is not even that's not even close to being accurate uh um according to scripture and so amen so when we look at that one God Amen it is it is not three person you can't have a person without having a personality so they they they they say one God in three persons amen that don't even make sense amen there's one God in three offices it's it's God taking off this veil of the pillar of fire stepping into the body that he created and it's now God living by the Holy Ghost in you it's one God in his church that's been his desire the whole time and so the Book of Revelations here is amen this this first verse or in this first chapter here amen we find that he he is he says I'm the faithful witness I am out uh I'm from from him which is which was which is to come he's the faithful witness he's the first begotten of the Dead He's The Prince of the kings of the earth he's Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending which is which was which is to come the almighty now this is Christ giving witness if you look there in your Bible in that in in the first several verses here in in Revelations 1 it's it's written in red this is this is Jesus talking I am Alpha I am Omega I am the first I am I am the almighty God man so it's God uh uh revealing himself and so when he turns around to see who's doing the talking he is he's looking for the voice and there is the son of man walking in the middle of the in the midst of the candlesticks can you say Amen so so it's it's a beautiful thing of redemption because amen it's God coming down it's almighty God the invisible God now he's living in the body of Jesus to redeem us then he comes Amen in the power of the Holy Ghost to live his life through us now so we have gone through uh these some of these others he meant his head and and and his hair is like whoa that that was the judge as we have gone through his his feet is like undefined breath we talked about that last Wednesday night amen brass is judgment and as as Moses was commanded to to make a Brazen Serpent and to lift it up so that all that had sinned can look at that Brazen serpent they would live amen they would be healed from the plague and that's that was a type of Jesus Amen sin judge when Jesus he says if I be lifted up from the earth I will draw all men unto me he he was sin judge so the Judgment the penalty for sin was placed on the body of Jesus Christ and just as they looked and lived now we up to our lamb Jesus Christ and we can live oh don't you love him here tonight now now here we are amen we are now in in this fourth in the fourth person in Genesis and his voice was as the sound of many Waters now we understand we've already gone through some of this what does Waters represent amen y'all remember what Waters represent multitudes the scripture says they're in in Revelation 17 and 15 they are peoples multitudes Nations and tongues so when he now when he so when he uses the the the the waters the in the Book of Revelations then you can always go back all right he's dealing with multitudes Nations peoples and tongues amen so now he's saying this one that is walking in and out of the of the candlesticks he's when he utters his voice it is as the sound of many Waters amen and so uh we when we look at this now remember he's a judge amen he's got his wig on his eyes the flames of fire judgment is now here they have forsaken the words of the Lord and now judgment has come he is coming as a judge now amen so what are we let's just look just real quickly uh what these uh this voice of many waters are amen if it's multitudes and it's in its peoples and its tongues it would be the multitudes of witnesses who have preached the gospel amen and again what is the picture here amen it's it's it's those who gave voice to the Holy Spirit declaring the Gospel of Jesus Christ so so it would be the it would be the the seven Messengers to the seven Church ages it would be the it would be the faithful five-fold Ministry who has been preaching the gospel throughout the ages it would be it would be the Saints who have believed the word of God your word now it's not that it's not that that you're necessarily preachers but you are taking the word of God you're living that word you become the voice Amen brother Brandon would put it this way he says his voice was as the sound of multitude speaking what is it it is the Judgment for these are the voices of the multitudes of witnesses who by the Holy Ghost All Through the Ages have testified to Christ and preached his gospel it will be the voice of every man rising up in judgment Against The Sinner who would not take warning the voices of the seven Messengers will be heard loud and clear those faithful preachers who preach them saving a power of Jesus who preach water baptism in Jesus name who preach the unfilling and power of the holy spirit all stood with the word more than they stood with their own lives all of them were the voice of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost down to the ages amen now if you want to look there in in John 17 and 20. and we can turn there real quickly amen since this is a Bible study amen and and we can we can catch uh the vision here uh they're in John 17 and 20. it says um oops I'll wait a little bit longer here praise the Lord you know I'm so proud of our young people they've got their Bibles and they and and they're pretty quick amen this is awesome and um and I like your notebooks and and uh taking notes and things because uh we are stopped we're just sort of slowing down to break it down amen and I I I believe the Bible says he hides it from the wise and the Nobles and the princes of this world and he reveals it unto babes I believe the Holy Spirit can reveal even to you young people none well William on these on these Wednesday nights we can pray Lord reveal yourself to me is that right amen but now look here at John 17 20. it says neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word so when he's when he's talking now amen multitudes people's Nations amen it is it is the the the entire time the of the seven Church ages from these last two thousand years from the time that Christ uh uh uh rose from the dead ascended into heaven until he comes to take us back amen the gospel has been preached and declared throughout all of those years but now remember he is now a judge he is standing there can you imagine every word that the preacher has preached amen is on record every word God's keeping record of of every word that is being preached when we stand there on that day we won't be able to say well I didn't know well I didn't hear well I didn't have amen God will pull the movie screen down and play the story of your life true well praise the Lord he's going to play the story he's going to play it amen of people who have rejected Christ and they're going to say well I never I've never heard the message well I never went to a message but God gave them an opportunity by the life you lived in front of them and that's why it's important that we live this gospel because your life will be then can you say amen amen so all of them were the voice of of Jesus Christ now he would say now have you ever thought uh how terrifying it is to a man drifting helplessly toward a cataract now think now of that Roar as he approaches his sure and certain doom and just exactly like that it's coming the day of judgment when the Roar of the multitude of voices condemns you for not having paid heed Aaron it was too late take heed this very hour for at this moment your thoughts are being recorded in heaven now there your thoughts speak louder than your words like the Pharisees who claim to so much with his mouth but not listening to the Lord his heart became corrupt and evil even until it was too late even now this could be your last call to hear the word and receive it unto eternal life it will be too late when you approach the Roar of the voices of judgment and doom but have you also have you ever noticed how sweet and relaxing the sound of water can be he says I like to fish I like to find a spot where the water is whispering in ripples I can just lie back and hear it speaking peace and joy and contentment to my heart how glad I am to be anchored in the Haven of Rest where the voice of the Lord speaks peace as the word of the Waters of separate nation has declared how thankful we should be to hear his voice of love and care and guidance and protection someday we will hear them saying Sweet Water the same sweet voice speak not in judgment but in welcome to us whose sins have been remitted by his blood whose lives have been Spirit-filled whose walk was in the word what could be more precious than to hear the multitude of welcoming voices be surrounded by those multitudes who have believed unto eternal life oh there is nothing like it I pray you will hear his voice and Harden not your heart but receive him as your king can you say amen amen now now just as just as the waters separated uh uh uh destroyed the world Amen it was those same Waters in Noah's day that destroyed the world and the same Waters that destroyed the world lifted Noah up above all of the Judgment same Waters the word you're listening to the words of Life the Bible amen that we're Believing on those words will be judgment on that day when the judge stands up amen now he's not going to be saying anything new he has sent witnesses to the Earth and those Witnesses are either going to be accepted or rejected can you say amen amen God gives that opportunity and so we want to listen now I want us to look there at the uh it says the next one is it says and he had in the 16th verse he had in his right hand Seven Stars now I want us to look at these Seven Stars real quickly and and and um I the sevens uh uh sevens of course we understand the right hand of God it speaks a position it speaks of authority and power that right hand uh amen any any time that you say on you know Joseph was seated at the right hand of pharaoh man it meant that he was seated in a position of authority amen he was in Authority so now he's got seven stars in his right hand Seven Stars in his right hand now we understand that if you were to go down there to the uh you know the 21st verse or the 20th verse amen it says the Seven Stars are the seven angels of the seven churches amen seven Messengers so but there's something about seven that has an incredible importance importance to God Amen now as God is perfected in threes and um amen he he's he's he's perfect how many believes God's perfected in threes he's there's the the numerous the numerals uh the numbers of God Amen uh he he works in threes he's perfected in threes father Son and Holy Ghost in in threes it's the amen uh uh they're in first John five and seven it says uh for there and we can turn there just real quickly I'm it's not exactly where I'm wanting to to get to but uh let's go ahead and turn there for some of these young and sake amen but you look there in in first John and uh uh five and the seventh verse praise the Lord amen it says for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost these three are one now there's then you go to the next verse the exact next verse your new birth is completed in threes amen and and it says and there are three that bear witness in the Earth Spirit water and blood and these three agree in one so you've got the one God in three manifestations God is complete in three you but your new birth amen it requires you can have blood but you can and you might not have water you might have uh the word and you not have the blood but when you put them all together it consummates to one New Birth amen so it requires water even in the natural water blood and spirit to make you a human being can you say Amen now so in the Bible those threes threes are important man is is made in the image of God he has Body Soul and Spirit there are three compartments in the Tabernacle amen there were the outer courts inner courts and then there was the most holy Place amen and if you could type that out you are three you have you're Tabernacle you are the Tabernacle of God Amen there's three compartments you have the outer courts inner courts in the most holy Place Body Spirit and soul so we we understand those things that you look there at five five is the number of Grace amen Israel came out of of of Egypt in in in in in five in rank that David picked up five smooth Stones The anointing oil comprised of five different ingredients according to Exodus 30 and 23. uh there there was a five-fold Ministry so five deals with Grace but now sevens are really in or in important with God of course six is the number of man uh six but Man was created on the sixth day amen Earthly civilization will be for six days the Antichrist will be 666. so but sevens I want to deal with the seven for a few moments here uh this evening seven is God's number in completion now seven days complete one week amen God created the heavens and the Earth in in six days and God saw that it was good and he rested on the seventh day amen Madness to rest on the seventh day the land is to rest every seven years amen the Year of Jubilee was on the seventh year amen at the end of seven sabbaths would be the Year of Jubilee pronounced now I want you to look at all these sevens in the Bible amen there are seven colors in the Spectrum amen so God gave a seven colored rainbow sign to Noah amen there are seven colored rainbow uh seven rainbow colors are seen around the throne in the Book of Revelations there are in the book of Hebrews there are seven eternals amen Hebrews 1 and 6 says he's a priest forever Hebrews one and nine he's he's got Eternal salvation Hebrews 6 and 2 Eternal judgment Hebrews 9 and 12 Eternal Redemption 9 and 14 eternal spirit 9 and 15 Eternal inheritance 13 and 20 Everlasting Covenant so God deals with seven seven means what completion amen there's Seven Seals seven trumpets name on seven candlesticks Seven Stars amen all right amen Israel marched around a Jericho for seven days on the seventh day they marched around seven times amen there were seven priests and seven horns amen if you want to look there in Joshua 6 and 4. amen the Bible says there were seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of Ram's horns on and the seventh day you shall Compass the city seven times and the priest shall blow the trumpet so so sevens sevens represent a mountain it's a type of where we are in seven Church ages now I want you to catch this because he'd done a lot of types of sevens amen because it was it was going to mean something in the future now we're still talking about the seven candlesticks amen hallelujah I think it's interesting Elisha's servant search for rain six times but on the seventh time he got rain he saw a cloud like into a man's hand and God opened up the heaven God told Naaman go dip in Jordan seven times amen now though he dipped uh six times in hope the seventh time is when he was healed they were to hold the unleavened bread a feast of bread for seven days amen there were seven uh a compound Redemptive names of God Amen there's Jehovah Jireh Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Nissi Jehovah Shalom Jehovah rayah the Jehovah titsukanu Jehovah shama amen these are the seven Redemptive names that God revealed himself to Israel in the Old Testament amen now you say now what do all these sevens speak of these sevens are representing completion now I want you to understand because God was fixing to do something in these last days through the blood of Jesus Christ now seven often accompanies the Fulfillment of promises and I want you to I want you to think about this for a moment it says I I I I looked up the Hebrew word for seven it is Sheba amen the Hebrew word for swearing an oath or the promise is Shabbat and both of them amen derived from the same Hebrew word Saba and Saba means satisfaction or fullness so now when you look there amen this is the fullness of God's completion now what church age are we in here tonight we're in the seventh we're in the seventh the completion of what God is doing the Rapture is upon us we are getting close to going home amen now so seven speaks of the Redemption of the Fallen man through Seven Ages it's the completion or the finality it's the promiseful field or it's rest it is God keeping his word bringing band back to completion now amen uh now it's not important that you remember all of that but I just think it's interesting as we're dealing with the seven Church ages because I'm fixing to to to to get into the meat of what I'm wanting to say amen I I thought it was yeah incredible job's accusers sit there for seven days accusing or without even saying a word to uh to job you know amen and and thinking he was a he was a sinner a man but job said he was resting in the works of his lamb and he offered it daily for he and his children is that right now they're they're in the Book of Revelations now amen there was a lamb with seven horns a minute so now remember all these sevens there was a lamb with seven horns the Redemption uh uh through his sacrifice amen and and if you were to go back in the Old Testament the blood was to be sprinkled seven times so they were to take according to Leviticus Leviticus four and five you can write it down you don't have to turn there but it says and the priest that is Anointed shall take of the Blick's blood bring it to the Tabernacle of the congregation and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle the blood seven times before the Lord before the veil of the sanctuary now seven times they were to take that blood and he was to sprinkle it four seven times amen amen then the scripture says Leviticus 16 and 14 he shall take the blood of the bullet sprinkle it with his finger upon The Mercy Seat Eastward before the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger how many times now why is God doing any anything of this importance anything of anything of great importance it was the mercy seat seven times with the blood it was speaking of the Lamb that was to come and when John seemed the lamb John seen the lamb amen uh with with seven horns and seven eyes he is speaking of that is speaking of of the of the church that is to come amen so now here we are again Hallelujah now here's here's the seven Church ages here's the seven that's the candlesticks it's made of beaten gold amen that's that's going to be the church now I want us to to to look here for for a few moments because as we as we go through these studies here in the book of uh Revelation I think it's I think it's incredible amen how that and again 1500 years before Jesus came amen there was they were already in type sprinkling the blood seven times on The Mercy Seat which was a type of Jesus shedding his blood for seven Church ages it would be Christ's blood that would be just as real today as it was the first church age man and so how many how many uh following me thus far amen now what we just read is Christ has seven stars in his right hand amen now we the the scripture says those seven stars were the seven Messengers or the seven angels now these angels is not Heavenly Angels amen the the they're Earthly Messengers you see they cannot be Heavenly main uh Messengers because Angels don't need messages sent to them Angels bring the messages to us amen now if you look there in in um you can you can put it up there first uh there in in Revelations one or Revelations three and one amen and and it it has um it says um or actually uh what we can use that unto the angel of the church in Sardis so he's not talking to an ER a Heavenly Angel he's talking to an Earthly messenger Amen in fact he says I want you to write this and I want you to send it to the messengers of the churches in Asia y'all understanding that so they're in Revelations 2 and 1 unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus you cannot send a letter to a Heavenly Angel amen is that right so it's an Earthly Angel it's an Earthly messenger that that is that is being sent so he's got seven of these Messengers in his hand in his right hand is that right now I want us to look the Bible says there are seven spirits Before the Throne amen the Bible says there's seven horns there's seven eyes there's seven stars there's seven lamps we're all back into these seven seven seven seven seven seven all right how many wants to look into some of these sevens real quick amen now all right let's look here in Revelations one and four and now we're getting into what I want to talk about praise the Lord now it says unto the angel or or see uh John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was which is to come and from what the seven spirits which are before his throne amen so we got seven spirits before he has thrown all right let's look at another one they're in Revelations 3 and 1. unto the angel of the church in Sardis right these things saith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy work that thou Hast the name that thou livest and are dead let's go to Revelations 4 and 5. foreign and out of the throne preceded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of Fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God all right let's go on over to the fifth chapter sixth verse and I be held and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God now now that would be interesting now now they've got a trinity what are we going to do with seven of them amen what are we going to do with seven so do we now have seven up there no it's the same God but he is operating Amen in in in uh in Seven Ages all right so what have we saw we see now we have seen Their Stars don't be laughing at me girls amen we have Seven Stars what else did we just see hallelujah what else did what what else did we just look at amen there were seven stars and then there's also let's see uh there's seven lamps Hallelujah see if I can make a lick of fire oh boy they're going to laugh at that one you guys have given me a complex man Hallelujah all right I'm telling you right now I'm putting a disclaimer on that okay so we've got seven licks of fire we got seven lamps what else did we just find that is over there amen seven eyes so we've got seven eyes Hallelujah all right then we've got seven horns y'all waiting on this one ain't you Eat Your Heart Out Haven amen okay so now we've got now so we've got seven stars we've got seven lamps we've got seven eyes we've got seven horns now this and the scripture just said amen let's go back over it the seven horns are the seven spirits that's that's Revelations five and six amen now brother Branham said the horns represent the strength of God in The Seven Ages the horns are God's strength to protect the Lamb's work amen that's the strength of the ages that's that lamb that is there seven eyes the Bible says is the seven spirits of God brother Branham says these are the seven these are seers Prophets these are the ones that are bringing that are keeping an eye on the church bringing the words of life to these Seven Ages are you hearing me amen now now yeah yes you can yep yep those are those are messengers amen they're seers they're prophets they're Messengers amen what did the Bible say the seven lamps were the seven spirits of God so now we've got the horns or the seven spirits we've got the eyes or the seven spirits which brother Branham says is are the prophets or the seers then then the Bible says the seven lamps Revelations four and five are the seven spirits it's all going to each a amen but it's bringing the lamp what was the what was the original brother Branham taught us the original fire amen that they lit the candlesticks came from the Shekinah Glory of God that originally started the fire in the beginning amen it's the same power it's the same fire of Holy Ghost the power of Pentecost in every one of those churches amen it's the revelation of God that has been given can you say Amen the original Revelation is the only Revelation you will ever have praise the Lord you don't it's not important what I say about it it's not important what anyone else says about it every one of these Flames all came from the original Power of Holy Ghost which was the Bible remember the two trees and amen you had the two trees here praise the Lord and and uh amen that they're in in and then the oil came out of that remember we've been talking about that that's the this is the Old Testament this here is the New Testament amen it's the same it's the word the power of the Holy Ghost flowing through the word into these seven Church ages giving it life giving it strength God lives in his word amen can you say Amen now we also know that the Stars we know that the Stars amen are simply the these These are are special Stars these stars are messengers that are reflecting light from the throne praise the Lord these These are here now brother Branham says in their own now these stars are special it requires the sunlight of the Lamb to shine upon those stars to reflect now I I heard someone say the other day so well brother Brad I'm just totally missed it stars stars do not reflect the sun science says Stars don't do not reflect the sun Hallelujah and and I said well that's just about as bad as the guy that was saying there's no way that a whale can pre uh you know can swallow swallow a human being it was a prepared fish and these are prepared Stars amen these these stars have no light of their own and it took a prophet in this day to come and say they are reflecting light from the throne man now are y'all are y'all catching that now now I want you to look that now again uh um praise the Lord now there was there was yeah there's okay there I am so each one of these are are sent now if there if you'll notice Iman um if you look there in in Revelations 5 and 6 again you don't have to turn there we just we just turned there but remember it you know it says I'll be held alone the midst of the Throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders to the lamb had been slain had seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God and I want us to all read the last part sent forth into all the Earth so it's the seven spirits down through the periods of time now again the church it's it's seven distinct periods of time from the time that Christ went up to the time that he catches us up amen these last two thousand years seven periods of time this Spirit seven spirits of God have been sent to the earth now some of you are asking I am just really confused about seven spirits of God it's one God reflecting himself or manifesting himself to seven different periods of time there's not seven spirits there's not seven gods yes okay the eyes were identified as Earthly Messengers so I and I should probably put that on there so the stars are Earthly Messengers and they that's why we make it clear unto the messenger and he and he and he made it clear so that we'll understand that these are not Heavenly Messengers write it and send it to the angel at Ephesus send it to the angel of Smyrna send it to the angel which is the messenger now messenger and it and and it's it's not it's it's there it's you Angel uh a a Heavenly angel or an Earthly Angel which would be an Earthly messenger they all come from that same word and so uh it wasn't quite it it's the when they were writing the King James version they just put it all as Angel and you have to hey it it you have to do a little bit of study uh looking at this to see and of course we've got the we've got the prophet of the age that pointed it out to us that it can't be going to a Heavenly Angel because first of all amen Angels bring Messengers from heaven and so amen so here's the difference these are Earthly Messengers this here is the remember these these here are the seven spirits from the throne sent to Earth so these are Earthly men with with the with Prophet God living on the inside declaring the words of life to that age you understand that okay so the seven eyes now remember we we just we just uh uh let me go back that put that back up uh five and six it says having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth all right so these these Stars here again us these stars are prepared Stars they can't reflect on their own so though they are they are born to be prophets though they are born to be uh a leaders until the angel comes from the throne one of the seven angels from the throne comes down with that Revelation they are just as empty as empty can be so the anointing of that we we understand that the eyes is Prophet God Amen the eyes of the Lord run to and fro all things are naked uh before him whom we have to do he knows all things he sees all things the Bible says he's looking throughout the whole earth looking for a heart that is perfect towards him so we know that if I'm if if I'm the pr if I'm a prophet if I'm born to be a prophet to the seventh age I have to have amen the spirit coming one of the seven spirits coming from the throne to enlighten me or I'm just as empty as can be I'm a star but I've got to reflect the light that he brings you you understanding that so so rev they have to depend on Revelation they had to depend on God to give the Revelation to each one of those ages or they were nothing that's exactly right and that's why these that that's why they're in his hand they're not touched by seminaries they're not touched by by mortal thinking these men are ordained of God for a specific purpose and the spirit of God of course we know the strength comes from his word we know that that that the prophet brother Brandon said over and over the Holy Ghost is the prophet the Holy Ghost is a prophet so amen and what he was trying to say is amen I'm waiting on him and when he comes oh now I can tell you yes you've got this problem that brother Brandon would sit there for 20 30 40 minutes amen just talking and talking and at the end they're just waiting what was he doing well he was just as hopeless and helpless as any mortal man until then he'd say now I take every Spirit under my control he was a yielded vessel so he is one he is so when you're looking at these amen it is now does that answer your question yes that is the eyes or is is representing Prophet God it's the all-knowing god that is that is that is being sent to each one of those ages and and giving them the Revelation uh for their day that's that's right it is all now if you want to if you want to break it down it's it's basically all the same thing it's all the seven spirits of God Amen but what and I and and and before we go uh too much further let me ask you this is uh how are you kids handling this are y'all all right now I went through all the sevens and I I didn't want to blow your mind on the set but there's a lot and I didn't bring all the sevens in from the Old Testament neither uh uh but there's a but God dealt with sevens and the whole purpose for all of the sevens okay Jericho when there's going around Jericho they were they were supposed to go Jericho seven days one two three four five six seven on the seventh day they were to go seven times we've been going for Seven Ages but on the seventh on the seventh Church age is when the seven Thunders revealed the seven angels came down and revealed the whole scope of what the Bible has been doing praise the Lord it was a type of what we are today y'all catch that so now when you're looking at the sevens in the Bible or in in the in in the Book of Revelations here amen you can see I'm wanting to put this in order here that how it all has to do with these seven Church ages the seven Church Ages was put out there and in the in Revelations 1 that the seven Church ages amen are is the Candlestick represented the churches amen and then this is specific Revelation Civic anointing specific power to overcome the spirits of that age and we're in the very last periods of time if you go through Revelations 2 and 3 you will see that it is it it it it has the whole Canon of these last two thousand years and these periods of times that that we have gone through now now I I I want to tell you this is not you know it's not a new doctrine there's still only one God Amen someone say one God amen John John uh beginning of John 4 and 24 it says God is a spirit singular amen it doesn't say God is seven spirits amen God is a a singular spirit is that right he can never change so now what's going on now this is what I've been trying to tell you in going through the sonship and father because it seems really they're saying it's one God and then all of a sudden Jesus has got a father and everybody no no no God created a body and that body was just as helpless as your body he says I can do nothing except the father for show me my meat is to do the will of him that sent me but after he died for your sins was raised from the dead Hallelujah he has been given a name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow is that right it was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself he says there's one God and one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus Hallelujah so it was God in the pillar of fire it was God in the burning bush it was God in the cloud it was God to Jehovah Jireh Jehovah shama Jehovah tits canoe Jehovah it's gone and all it's still the same God but he's revealing himself in a different light to each one now I want us to look here for a moment because they're in in first Timothy 1 and 17 and I want I want us to turn these next two scriptures for sure uh so you kids let me know all right any any questions uh make sure you're again we're we're wide open on Wednesday nights so just put whatever you want to add to it ask questions [Music] don't wait till after the service to ask them because somebody else might really some all these questions are always asked me afterwards I said man I didn't want to ask because I didn't want everyone to think I was Dumb and I I'm saying well the problem is is they're dumb too wanting to ask the same question amen we all we we're all a little bit like that ain't we amen and uh and and we'll you know I don't even know if I'll have the answer but at least uh we'll give it a try anyways huh amen so first Timothy are you there First Timothy 1 and 17. amen and uh it says now unto the king eternal immortal invisible the only wise God be honor and Glory forever and ever amen so how many gods do we have amen if we have more there's only one that's wise amen all right one God hear o Israel the Lord thy God is one all right let's look here at Jude amen the Apostle Paul did not preach many gods and I I hope that I've been helping you get to this get get to understand that this body that God lived in that God created was just as helpless without with without God now he was God God lived in that body but that body was totally Reliant he was 100 God he was 100 human being God did not die when Jesus died Jesus Paid the price it was a lamb he was that was the son that was the lamb well praise the Lord there's prophecies about there had to be a prophet there had there was going to be a a king there's going to be a sacrifice that and it that had to all be a man now let's look here at Jude 1 and 25. amen to the what only wise God and his savior no to the only wise God our savior be glory and majesty and dominion and power both now and ever amen all right so let's let's explain it let's let's go to First Corinthians 12. and then we'll start wrapping it up how far how good am I doing amen um okay so it's 8 25. all right so First Corinthians 12 and 5. and the Apostle Paul is going to explain how God works amen so uh First Corinthians 12 and 5. praise the Lord amen you'll find it amen how are you youngins doing it's right after the book of Romans praise the Lord there are differences of Administrations but the same Lord there are diversities of operations but it is the same God which worketh all in all to save time let's go down to the eighth verse 4 to 1 is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit to another Faith by The Same Spirit to another Gifts of healing bye The Same Spirit to another working of Miracles to another prophecy to another Discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that all these workers that all these work is that seven that nine that one self same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will can you say Amen so when we're looking here it's the diversity it's one God coming in seven manifestations if you were to see if you if I had my chalkboard up here a little bit more it's all the same God the same logos that is that is coming and reflecting himself to each one of these ages the same God not seven spirits one spirit seven manifestations one God three offices that's the reason why they said in in Isaiah 9 and 6. amen and you can put that up there sister Keys uh you kids could probably quote that we do that in our in in our quiz every every year amen unto us a child someone say child this is the sonship this is Christ this is Jesus born in a manger amen a child is born a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father come on I just wish these theologians that's writing Bibles would just get it right he's a son if he's the son how can he be the Everlasting father you're messing things up no the Everlasting father created the body and moved inside the body so when Jesus says when you have seen me you've seen the father amen Hallelujah but the reason for the body to be born in the first place was to die but more than just die it was to show you the relationship that God wanted to have with man and when you get to the other side there's going to be a man sitting up on the throne it'll be a man God it'll be the man Jesus Christ it'll be the only God the only Savior Jesus Christ he's going to have a body like yours and not like these not a sinful body not a not uh no no no no no no you're going to be changed to be like him but you're going to have eyes like a man God's got eyes like a man God's got Ears Like a Man God's got hands like a man the invisible God looks like a man he loved you so much that he become you so that you could become him do you love him yeah no let me show you just one last thing here that I I think is is good so now we've got so we've got the seven horns which are the seven spirits amen which is the strength of the church not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the Lord you've got seven eyes which are the seven spirits which is Prophet God coming down and Discerning the age that they're living in amen he brought me raised up Martin Luther as as the Reformation to stand up and and to stand up against it how did the Roman Catholic church had put everyone uh any kind of person for 1500 years put them put them to death that would rise up against him how did he do it because there was a horn standing right up there was an anointing that was sent to Earth in the glory of the Lord all right what is it Sears well a Seer is a prophet let's let's let's look here let's look here in the book of Hebrews and this is what I should have showed you a while ago this year's would be a better explanation it's scriptural now Hebrews um let's see we're Hebrews 4 and 12. now y'all remember when we first started this um some some weeks back I told you and the reason why we we titled this this mysterious one who is this mysterious one walking in the midst of the candlesticks it's the logos of God Amen that was the word now it was an invisible God but when God spoke then the light comes so the first light was not the sunlight the first light was the pillar of fire and from that Pillar of Fire is where everything else came from so the Eternal thoughts of God that was in his mind amen from all eternity God does not have a new thought amen God's God's got that but when he spoke then here come the what the what the theologians call the logos that's that Pillar of Fire amen God is now living inside that Pillar of Fire is the fire to come to Moses demon spoke out of the burning bush it was the fire that led the children of Israel it was the fire that came down and licked up the sacrifice to Elijah of Elijah it was the it was the pillar of fire that came down and visited our Prophet it was it was that Pillar of Fire it was God can you say Amen now it's the logos is that Living Word so it's not like a word here on this page it's a Living Word it's a word when you in the beginning was the logos not the word on a page The Living Word it was when God spoke Hallelujah before we start that let's let's look here at let's just go up to Revel or to uh while we're here in in Hebrews 4 and where are we at four and well before we go there let's go up for a minute the third verse is which we we which have believed you enter into rest as he saith as I have sworn in my wrath they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world The Works were finished his word was already spoke can you say Amen now and if you go one down and and it says amen and it's the whole thing is all talking about the word being preached amen and and he's talking about that rest and he's talking about how that you know he says uh the second verse for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached was not did not profit them not being mixed with faith but we which have believed do enter into rest as he have sworn as he said out sworn in my wrath they shall enter my rest although the works were already finished from the foundation of the world now now then he goes on down to the um he's talking about believing and disbelieving the 11th verse let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest ye any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick powerful it's that word quick is living it's living and Powerful sharper than any two-edged sword Piercy even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit joints tomorrow is a discerner of thoughts and intents of a heart neither is there any creature that has not manifest in his sight in a word you know there's nothing that you can hide from him but all things are naked and open unto the what eyes of him with whom we have to do so this word this logos is the amen it's the all-knowing eyes of God God knows everything about you girls he knows everything about you boys he knows everything he knows everything done in secret he knows everything there is not there is not a little gnat that bats his eye that God doesn't see it and God doesn't know it God knows all things his eyes see all things there is nothing hidden from God that's God Angels can't do that no angels can do that Angels don't don't they're not like that God and God Alone is all knowing again again though it was it's not a new thought God is eternal it's hard to put that in our mind but God is God God has seen this he's known it from eons and eons and eons before time all right the eye of God he's he's all-knowing these eyes when God would come down then he would anoint The Seer or he would anoint the messenger and that is how the Apostle Paul could could tell you that that's how he could be a prophet that is that is how our messenger could become a prophet Anointed with those eyes to see to be able to tell you what you think what you where where you live to tell you he knows all about you not the Mortal messenger but the eyes of the Lord does that make sense amen hallelujah how about how about you other kids anyone else anyone else have any anything any questions anything you want to add praise the Lord amen now little Lydia all right so now I want to talk about these Messengers uh for just give me give me five more minutes here and and um the same one God coming forth in a seven-fold manner now we read there in in Revelations uh four and five that the seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne are the seven spirits of God now John used nothing but Old Testament symbols so John anything that he used in The Book of Revelations you can find in the Old Testament whether it be lamps whether it be candlesticks all of all of those symbols you can find in the Old Testament time a lot of them you can find in the Book of Daniel but now uh uh but but I want us to look here on on this on this the spirit amen the the burning fire they're in Proverbs 20 and 27 the spirit of man is the candle of the Lord searching all the inward parts of the belly so now he is connecting he is connecting these Eternal flames to some to um to men here on the earth that God was going to anoint amen you look there in John 5 and 34 talking about John the Baptist the Bible says he was a burning and Shining Light amen and you were willing for a season to Rejoice with them now so these Messengers that God that God used let's just turn real quickly and then and the musicians can get prepared to come I'm that I'm going to use one last scripture here and I I want to go to Zechariah we've we've looked at this a time or two Zachariah is a hard one to find if you can find Zachariah you boys are doing good you kids man are you there they beat me Hallelujah this is this is awesome amen okay so Zechariah 4 and 10 it says for who hath despised the day of small things for they somebody say they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet in the hand of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord so we're going hmm all right let's see what those seven are amen let's go up to the second verse to the second and he said unto me what seeth thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold with a bowl on the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are up on the top thereof and two olive trees buy it one up on the right side of the bow the other up on the left side thereof so I answered and spoke to the angel that talked to me saying what are these my Lord let's go on down to the eighth verse moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts had sent me unto you for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and they and shall see the plummet in the hands of zerubbabel with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro throughout the whole earth then answered I and said unto him what are these to all of trees on the right side of the Candlestick and on the left side and I answered and said or he uh and I answered again and said unto him what be the olive branches with which through the two golden pipes empty the the golden oil out of themselves and he said unto me know us thou not and I said uh no my Lord and he said these are the two anointed ones that stand by the lord of the earth so here's your two trees these are the two anointed ones here's your new testament here's your Old Testament and the pipes came in and this is what the anointing of oil came giving the light through that church ages amen so so y'all understand amen so when he's saying the eyes of the Lord these seven these seven what seven he was talking about the candlesticks and the anointed ones that was coming in prophesying of this church age that we're living in to give us to see aren't you glad that at the end time the Lord says he'd open up our eyes to be able to see these things amen praise the Lord you have a question oh amen any any questions here tonight now we don't want to leave anyone confused so if anyone's are you enjoying just slowing down and talking about these kinds of things or no amen and um you know we I think it's a it's a wonderful thing to be able to um see these things that the Bible says that would be revealed to us this is this is part of the seals being opened up amen once the seals were revealed opened up now we can look at the at these symbols and we can say ah yes yes aren't you glad that God sent a seventh Church age messenger amen and that seventh Church age messenger listen you're not you're not going to get you're not going to get anything amen did you notice that in every one of those ages he said unto the angel of Ephesus angel of Smyrna unto the angel it was it was the eyes of God coming down talking to them giving light to that age Hallelujah and only you that have the Holy Ghost are going to be able to see it but when that light hits and it strikes amen oh there's a flame that burns there's a flame that burns and it burns bright it's not your flame it's that holy ghost flame that's within or that Holy Ghost within you that oil that's within you that's the one that the Rapture is coming for I want to be ready when he comes to be prepared for his coming amen Hallelujah aren't you glad you kids understand all right let's stand to our feet as we get ready to dismiss here tonight you man [Music] in this world there is how with God's Own Heart let the word of God [Music] if words are full give us free helpless code yeah [Music] holy words [Music] came to us through sacrifices [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] important amen the word of God must change us its living now remember man he's living in your body now he's living in you the anointing that was Upon Jesus Christ that great light the form of a dove came down and a bold within him and didn't depart it's that same life by the Holy Ghost that's living in you you're not the Redeemer you man that same Pillar of Fire is living in you but it is split
