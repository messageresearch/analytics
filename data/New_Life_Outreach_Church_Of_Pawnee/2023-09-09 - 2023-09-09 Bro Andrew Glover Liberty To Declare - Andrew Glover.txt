is doing right now amen not what he has done or what he's going to do but what he's doing right now amen we say God bless you this evening we sure appreciate brother Wendell the invitation to come and the opportunity to speak to you tonight and amen I truly believe that the Lord is I believe he's in control of all things he knows all things and we want to say God bless you tonight and we sure sure enjoyed that sermon this morning amen his brother Sean was laboring away into the anointing wasn't that powerful amen the word of the Lord amen amen as he was preaching I had to lean over brother windland just say that's my pastor amen I never was so proud to be identified with this message as I was this morning to hear my pastor declare the word of God like he did here this morning we said God bless you brother Sean thank you for your stand for this word and your leadership and amen we sure enjoyed brother Jonathan last night brother Manuel brother Daryl looking forward to the service in the morning with brother Kelly and amen don't you appreciate these men of God that's preaching this message amen they're not adding to or taking away they're just preaching the word of God change your Fallen devils are defeated we thank you men of God for your stand for this word amen if you have your Bibles tonight we want to go straight to the word if you turn with us to the book of Isaiah the 53rd chapter and that we want to look there in the eighth verse and while you're turning there I do want to say it's a honor and a privilege to be here and have my wife with me and our little baby Malachi with us this weekend and sure appreciate them for coming and making the trip and always always enjoy coming to Paul knee amen it's just a special place in our heart and to see all of our friends and amen the different Minister and brothers pastors here God bless you all amen God bless you Brother Sam amen the brother be on different ones I know brother Bryce is here amen we we sure appreciate these men of God don't we amen that are leading their churches under the headship of this message amen and we sure sure appreciate him and also want to uh to greet you tonight on behalf of brother Wayne he said it's not of course you know he's not able to be here but he sends his greetings to you and we sure appreciate brother Wayne and his stand for this word and amen I know if he if he could he'd be here amen but we are sure praying for brother Randall and the Lord's bringing him right along from that stroke and amen God is just merciful to his children amen and we thank the Lord for that amen the book of Isaiah the 53rd chapter and the eighth verse the Bible here said he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken now one translation of that city was taken away by distress and judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was she stricken now if we could turn to the book of First Corinthians the second chapter the book of First Corinthians the second chapter we've just read from the atonement and I believe that that atonement is in full effect here tonight don't you I believe healing is in it Deliverance is in it salvation is in it everything the Church of the Living God has need of is in that atonement tonight and if we turn here to the book of First Corinthians the second chapter Paul you're writing he uses a word that Isaiah used he says I Brethren when I came to you came not with Excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of God so the question was asking Isaiah who shall declare his generation first or second First Corinthians 2 Paul tells us that when he come to us he come declaring the testimony of God for I determined not to know anything among you saved Jesus Christ and him crucified and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration or we could say the Vindication of the spirit and of power now notice why Paul delivered the testimony of God the way that he did so that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but it should stand in the power of God your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God now I want to look one other place with you in the book of Acts the 20th chapter the book of Acts the 20th chapter and I want to read a few verses there in Acts 20 beginning with verse 27 Paul here is coming down to the end of his time here and in my Bible The Heading actually says the farewell words and I love these words of Paul in verse 27 he says I have not shunned to declare unto you all somebody say all I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God now take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseer to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood now brother remember says this is a prophecy for I know this that after my departing shall Grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock and also of your own self shall men arise speaking perverse things now here's the reason why to draw away disciples after them therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I cease not to warn every one of you night and day with tears and now Brethren I command you to God and to the word of his grace notice which is able it's not possibly going to happen it's more than able to happen which is able to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all them which are Sanctified amen how many thanks the Lord for the reading of his word tonight amen God bless you as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to tonight just to speak to you here and if I title this tonight I don't want to speak to you on Liberty to declare Liberty to declare you know I got to thinking sometimes we wonder what we need to really be amen what God has called us to be do we need a maybe a new church or do we need a new place or a new house or what what do we really need to be what God has called us to be but I'll tell you what I believe in by studying the message that what we need is Liberty amen I believe that's all we need to be what God has called us to be amen is Liberty Paul says this the Lord is that Spirit brother Jonathan quoted last night the Lord is that spirit and we're the spirit of the Lord is amen there is Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty now that word Liberty it means Liberty to do or to admit things having no relationship to Salvation it is the license or the Liberty to do as one pleases amen it in true Liberty is living as we ought to amen and not as we please now amen I so appreciate it this morning how that brother Sean was laying out that this message amen is not legalism it's not a bunch of do's and don'ts amen amen but this message is a message of Grace so when we preach the grace of God we're not preaching the grace of God to give the church a license to sin amen but we are preaching the grace of God to give the church the license Amen to be what God called them to be amen and Liberty can only come to the grace of God now the prophet of God said a doctor said to me not long ago oh I was talking to him and he said brother Brandon what's the matter with those people said they're just worked up that's what makes him act like that crying running to the altar said it's emotion I said Doctor you ought to know enough it takes something to excite the nerve amen before that a person could be emotional he said certainly it is now listen to The Prophet it's something present amen it's something present and it is true that when the Holy Ghost comes down it stirs the crowd to emotion he said their Anointed with the spirit of God and the Holy Spirit sweeps across them amen it stirs an emotion it's got to because Jesus said if they hold their peace amen the rocks will immediately cry out and what could we do he said now when I think of that amen now listen it ain't the people he said it ain't the people shining it's the Holy Ghost shining on them amen that's doing these things that's what's doing it it's not the people it's the spirit of God on them amen that makes them believe so you're not believing amen and just because of who you are or what church you attend amen but you are believing because there is a liberty that has come upon your life from the grace of God Amen to believe these things it is the spirit of God on them amen that gives them Liberty it is the spirit of God on them amen that makes them feel free amen I say this tonight we do not have to feel embarrassed we do not have to feel ashamed we do not have to reserve amen who we are amen because what is wholeness is not coming from who we are amen it is coming from the liberty of the grace of God that has been bestowed upon our life and amen we have quickly now identified amen that the source of Liberty is the spirit of God Amen if there's no Spirit there's no Liberty amen if there's no Liberty it's because there's no spirit amen but I just want to say that God supplies the Liberty that's why that wherever we go we can have church amen if nobody else wants to we can have church ain't been because we didn't come here to get everything life amen we brought our own Revival with us we didn't come here to see if there was any Liberty amen when we come here amen we brought our own liberty with us because this is not a church Revival it's not a man-made Revival amen it is a word born Revival it is a Revival of anointing it is a Revival of Liberty that's why I say this amen you didn't give me my Liberty and you can't take it away amen you didn't give me my joy and you can't take it away you didn't give me my faith and you can't take it away amen the liberty of the grace of God Has Come From God into our flesh to manifest amen the message of the hour and to declare it now amen I believe that the message of the hour is Amen to manifestation of Liberty the Bible says in first John 1 1 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes we have looked upon on our hands have handled amen of the word of life he says for the life was manifested and we have seen it and Bear witness and show unto you amen that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us now we're not talking about any kind of life now we're talking about manifested life and verse 3 John says that which we have seen amen and heard declare we unto you amen that you may also have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ amen I just want to Inland a foundation to break down amen three words there in first John 1 3. John says that which we have seen that word seen it means to see with the eyes it means to see with the mind it means to perceive it means to become acquainted with amen by experience it means amen this word gives prominence Amen to the Discerning mind so so what your eyes can see amen your mind can proceed amen but then John moves down and says what we have seen amen and her listen this word heard it means to be in dude with the faculty of hearing it means not to be deaf to attend to it means to perceive by the ear what is announced in one's presence Amen to perceive by the ear what is announced in one's presence amen it means to learn or to give ear to a teaching amen or a teacher or to comprehend to understand amen now watch John has moved from the mind and now he's moved to the ear amen but he does not stop at the mind he does not stop at the ear but he goes on and says what we have seen and what we have heard amen declare and that word declare it needs to bring Tidings from a person or a thing it means to bring a word a report Amen to Proclaim and to make known openly they've been to declare that which has been seen and which has been heard amen I want to say this we have heard the message amen we have seen the message we have read the message amen but if there's ever been a time Amen to give our voice to this message amen now is the time amen not just to see the message not just to hear the message but now is the time to rise up and declare what you have seen declare what you have heard declare what your faith has brought into you by the reality of Christ amen and these things right we unto you amen that your joy might be full I love what John says in verse 5 he says this then is the message amen this then is the message that word message is an announcement it is a promise it is the act of promising amen it is a promise given or to be given it is a promised good or a blessing so we can read first John 1 5 and say this then is the announcement or this then is the promise or this then is the blessing that God has given this generation that there is no darkness in God but he is a God of Light amen I say it like Isaiah said he said now has heard and see all this and will not ye declare it now come on church amen you've heard it you've seen it but will you not declare it have I showed you these new things from this time amen even hidden things amen that thou did us not know them so whatever is being seen and whatever is being heard amen is worthy to be declared it is worthy to be proclaimed it is worthy to be published and then now the problem of God you know these quotes and I'm just laying the foundation and the message from that time 62 he said my Ministry is different he said from a pastor or a teacher he said I'm not and if I say things wrong Brethren forgive me I don't mean to amen but this is my Ministry Amen to declare him that he's here amen my Ministry is not amen a pastor or an evangelist amen but my Ministry is to declare him that he is here how could he declare he's here unless same that he's here and he has heard that he's here and he is revealing himself and he is here listen church we are not under Impressions we are not under feelings we are not under spooky things from the atmosphere when we say he's here it's because he's here and the power of his resurrection is because we see the influence of a supernatural being moving across the congregation listen I'm not a crazy man I am a believer that believes in a literal presence of Jesus Christ coming in the church by the message of the earth I think if you Cheney's here I think if you've heard he's here I think it's time somebody declare he's not just in the Pulpit he's not just in the music he's in the pews he's in the flesh he's in the young people he's in the old people he's in the preachers he's in the deacons he's in the babies my mom's hers my God is not in the Tomb and Jefferson meal he's not in a team in Jerusalem I have seen his appearing I have heard the voice of the seventh angel and I declare he's here I didn't just see it I didn't just hear it I'm going to declare it he's here and then somebody shout he's here he's here he's not just coming he's here notice 1965. amen I told you what a prophet said in my Ministry is to declare him he's here go to 1965. notice the very day when this messenger not when he starts on but when he begins to declare his message when he begins to declare his message see the first pool was healing the second pole was prophesied but the third poem was the opening of the word it was the Mysteries revealed and there's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets but the only way a prophet can be Vindicated amen is by the word and remember the third poem was the opening of them Seven Seals to reveal the hidden truth which had been sealed in the word so a prophet was announcing I have seen his appearing I have heard his voice and now I'm declaring to you that the message is not the first poor the message is not the second pill but the message is the third poem the revenge Nation it's the season to declare that the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac has returned to his seed in the last days to declare I am not dead I Am Alive forevermore I am here in poverty I am here in power I am here in supreme power amen I am here to declare myself Beyond feelings Beyond ideas Beyond sensation I'm here to declare with many infallible proofs that what you have seen what you have heard is now in your midst what you have seen what you have heard is now in your midst and I declare unto you I declare unto you now that you all know that God has to provide a way for everything right and God's provided way Amen to declare his word remembrance that is by his chosen way which is his prophet he said he came The Chosen way his word came and that was by His prophets which were predestinated and for ordained amen being a part of God's word amen declaring the revelation of his word to that age and that time so when a prophet begins to declare something amen he's not declaring something that has happened just in the past and he's not putting it way out in the future but he's declaring the revelation of the word in the air come on don't you see why there's an anointing in these meetings these guys are not just appearing John 14 12 and Mark 11 and Mark 16. amen by the God that was there when the Bible was being wrote has returned in this age unto the unveiling of the Mighty God and he is here in the building listen the same pillar of power that was on the Damascus Road that was on Mount Sinai that's returned in this church amen to confirm every word listen my God is not a way my God is right here in this building tonight to declare to you you are John 14 12. you are Mark 16. you learn Mark 11. you Lord come on Church you are the manifestly declared Epistles that have not been written by each they have not been written in stone but by the spirit and the grace of God he has wrote his word in the heart of his Believers and somebody's going to declare it somebody's going to declare it see because when that Prophet comes he always points back Amen to a great Supernatural God he said a modern day Prophet is a preacher so a real true preacher amen only points back to the word of the Lord which is the promise of the Lord now listen he's not pointing to the Declaration that the church is made but he is pointing to a declaration that God has made see back to the word of the Lord when a prophet begins to declare himself he is not pointing to the church's declaration he is pointing to God's declaration now you say Prophet yeah he must be Vindicated right so now let's watch of indicated Prophet 1951 I stand Here amen declaring the creator of the heavens and the Earth is Jehovah God he said now I claim to be a representative of his in this last day to bring a faith to his church so what he was declaring was not something to argue about come on now it was not something to fuss about it was not a new approach to baptism and a better way to preach the seals and a better way to preach Divine heal him but what he was delivering to the church was a declaration from the back part of God's mind come on now amen to bring a faith into the church do you realize the AIDS the seventh angel sounds is the age he'll say faith will be slow amen but listen it may be sure our fair but it's not slowing here because somebody is declaring the god of the Bible it's not a historical Affair but he's right here tonight come on Church he's here to save he's here to heal he's here to deliver he's bringing a faith into the church to believe for the impossible he's bringing a paper to the church to believe for the supernatural amen I'm just going to say what a prophet said he said in the name of Jesus Christ I take every spirit in here under my control to declare the word of God I I've ever spared in here here under my control to declare the word of God do you see what he was doing he was not asking for Liberty he was using his Liberty he was not beg in for Liberty he was using the Liberty that he received on the Ohio River he was using the liberty and he received in a cave he was using the Liberty he would shoot in the license that God gave him as a prophet to stand in cold formal intellectual Gatherings and declare that Jesus Christ is the god and he's a living God come on church amen you think you'd have a message if a prophet asked ever Baptist if it was okay to preach do you think you'd have a message if he asked every Pentecostal if it was okay to preach tongues it's not the evidence of the Holy Ghost he had a license by the predestinated seed only inside of his soul and when the anointing come by he didn't back up he stepped into it and began to declare Liberty Church Liberty's not coming Liberty's here I take my Liberty let me only take your Liberty right now many of that sleepy devil out of the house of God at church you need to take your Liberty to rebuke that line people that's telling you you're too sick and you're too bad and you're too bound and you're too old you need to take your Liberty to cut that devil's head off and put that devil in his place and remind him you're not a legalistic Believer you're a son and a daughter of hell and there's a liberty that has been given your life there's a Grace upon you Church there's a Grace upon you there's a license in your soul come on you ain't gotta ask nobody if you can raise your hand God give you the Liberty to raise your hand you wish nobody if you can Rejoice God give you the Liberty to Rejoice you ain't got to ask nobody if you can enjoy the anointing God give you the Liberty to enjoy listen we can do without the building we can do without the light we can do without the music but if we ever lose celebrity we might as well shut the doors and padlock the building but I want to protect devil on notice there's a new generation who will not back up able [Applause] to declare what they have seen the license to declare what they have seen and what they've heard now listen I'll tell you why you got to declare it it's cause there's a responsibility upon your life to do it [Applause] God is not going to bring back Paul to preach this message come on now he's come on he's not even going to bring back Brothers random to preach it it's already been preached come on well I'm looking for Peter look for him in the resurrection but he's not coming back to preach spiritual revelation [Applause] look for him in the resurrection but he's not coming back to preach he's already done his part now it's your turn it's your age it's your season it's your anointing it's your message come on how long are we going to sit here and let the devil put us in a corner and tell us to take a cold potato away I'm sick of cold potatoes I'm sick of arguing impressive and who can say what I think it's time to bring back the joy that's unspeakable I think it's okay to bring back good old-fashioned oh they go shouting and dancing and get back on the Holy Ghost and preach in the message I know you wish you could but you can't take my Liberty cause you didn't give it to me I got my own page I got my own books I got the Holy Ghost I got my own Revelation and I didn't come here and ask you if I can I come here to tell you you can you can get the same Holy Ghost you can get the same experience you can get the same reality somebody ought to declare it somebody ought to declared somebody giving praise let somebody push that old cold formal scorching intellectual prayed people out of the house of God well I'm afraid I'm afraid somebody match out I'm afraid somebody might Dance I'm afraid somebody might preach but you know what the devil's afraid of he's afraid somebody might get healed he's afraid somebody might get the Holy Ghost so you know what I do I cast out your fear I cast out your anxiety I cash capture imperviousness and impact the liberty of the Holy Ghost to come in this feeling until it will shackle pause every demon please ever spirit is rebuked and the liberty of the Holy Ghost close to the church once again [Applause] prophet of God said you got to declare it he said everything is a responsibility that responsibility to preach it you got a responsibility to believe it and we might as well go ahead and preach I got a responsibility to find it and shred it you got a responsibility get behind it [Applause] I know I know well let's preach a minute everything's responsibility he said it's hard to say but it's true ministers many times they shirk a responsibility see for standing for the true word of God when they're confronted with it see they'll shirk that responsibility when the truth of the word of God is brought face to face with three human beings we are prone to shirk back into the last resource message to the layout of sin age he said before the church can ever be taken to Glory it has to go through this world of criticism and sometimes we try to shirt back or pull back from criticism adoption part one he said God forbid that I ever shirk the job now in Acts 20 27 he says I have not shunned to declare unto you somebody says shun to declare unto you all all all the Council of God now look at this word shine it means to draw back it means to let down it means to lower wow it needs to withdraw from something it is of a timid person to withdraw oneself and to become timid listen it is of those who from Timothy hesitate to even Avail what they believe to be unwilling to utter from Fear so when you begin to sense something it's only because a spirit of fear a spirit of fear has come into the midst and to the atmosphere and there's a little bit of fear that says you really shouldn't say it or you really shouldn't go there amen but let me just tell you what Paul said he said I'm not shunned to declare unto you the whole Council of God and that word counsel is the purpose of God which you all know brother REM teaches us that nothing somebody say nothing that nothing can defeat the purpose of God he said woe unto me if I don't declare this counsel of God to the people of this healing power and he's here woe unto me if I only declare unto you that the message of Malachi 4 was a healing campaign or a shot in the hand rolling to me God forbid that I stand and appropriate and because of a spirit of fear refuse to declare to the people that's a god of the circle is in the heart of the Bride by the baptism of the Holy Ghost wrawn to me if I stand in the propane and son to declare the seventh seal is open woe unto me if I stand in the pulpit and failed to reach the revealed crash of this age come on Church well I might as well go and say it and woe unto you if you sit in the message Church [Applause] that crosses your Baptist idea or your Pentecostal idea I say away with those ideas and upper for Resurrection Jesus of this age now come on Church you say preacher you're getting triumphant I've got a responsibility you've got a responsibility it's to declare the word of God he said I know that it's something keep it back then God's going to make me pay for it as a day of judgment he said in this divinely revealed by the Holy Spirit the same angel of God that directs me to visions and directs me to see things is here Healing The Sick So the same Angel that's there when he's Healing The Sick praying for the sick when he's seeing visions is the same angel that was in the third pool he never changed angels for dispensation he only changed offices come on now it was the same God in the first book it was the same God in the second floor but in the third Paul he was bringing a bride's commission to firm the presence of God that's why Paul would write to Timothy and he would say these notable words he would say preach the word I come on I can preach here for a second preach the word you know what that's what everyone believer ought to be saying is preach the word preach the word I know I know I know sometimes we get in our mind amen that our personal convictions are very important but let me remind you Paul did not write to Timothy and say preach your personal convictions he wrote to Timothy and said preach the word preach the word so if you're going to stand In a Pulpit you can't stand there and say what you want to say you can't stand there and say whatever comes through your mind you can't stand there and say well you know what I don't want to get too deep so I didn't study I'm just going to get up here and say whatever comes to mind we don't care what's coming to your mind we got a message and it's a filter and you ought to lay in the pressure to that filter and let it filter out your mind filter out your spirit hurt me a lot less confusion if we'd get back to preaching the message and quit preaching personal convictions and feelings and what I think and I feel I don't care what you think I don't care what I feel I want to know what is God declared through the voice of the seventh angel than the age I'm living I remember one time I was out preaching somewhere a guy come to me and said I'm gonna give you an idea I want you to preach it he said it's my personal conviction I said what's that brother brother William he got to tell me all this stuff amen how to even Adam I mean bunch of crazy stuff he got done he said now go preacher I said I ain't gonna go preach that he said why not he said this because it's my personal conviction I said brother I Don't Preach my own personal conviction I sure ain't gonna preach yours come on church we got a message to declare time is running out the gospel is going back to the Jew quit wasting time with a bunch of petty complexes and so and so down there amen let it all go and that's the liberty of the Holy Ghost come back to the church again and manifest himself in our demonstration preach the word preach the word you have orders from a Vindicated Prophet preach the word preach the word he said I come here to preach this word you say preacher if I say that every devil hell getting yes man if you don't say it every now we will and if you do say it never never will so your mouth will be found preaching the word of God and making the devil mad and enjoying every minute of it raise your hand or you say Amen I'm gonna give you a bad week and then one day brother lost and I realize something that Devil's a liar that devil is alive and you know what he did he buffed me out for a long time and then I realized something brother Peter if I raise my hand or if I don't raise my hand the devil's going to meet me on Monday morning yeah if I worship God or I don't worship God the devil's going to meet me on Monday morning if I enjoy the meeting or I sit on the meeting the devil's going to meet me on Monday morning so you know what I decided to do I decided to give that old Scandal a run for his money I'm gonna shout I'm going to Rejoice I'm going to cry I'm gonna praise I'm going to believe I'm going to preach I'm going to speak I'm going to enjoy the blessings of God cause there ain't no Rock gonna cry out in my place there ain't no Spirit there ain't no storm or devil gonna shut me up and I refuse if I refuse to come back under some bondage around this message free and who the son has made free history in need I got a right to shout I got a lot to pray I got a lot to enjoy the blessings of God I'm taking my Liberty [Applause] it was hilarious we might as well feel any buff you you out you say preacher you're getting out there preaching no I think we need to take the gloves off and preach cause the preaching of the Gospel is the casting out of the devil when you preach the gospel it casts the devil out you say preacher aren't you afraid to stand there and preach this message well I learned a long time ago from my pastor Amen to a sermon I think for every even before we ever even moved to Virginia brother Sean I heard you stand somewhere and declare that the angel of the Lord accompanies the message hallways do you realize who you are tonight you are the Bride of Jesus Christ and your TAP in the Bible is Zion and Hebrews 12 22 says that ye are coming to Mount Zion unto a city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem listening to an innumerable I come on Church you have come to an innumerable accident am I reading that right an innumerable company of Angels the proud of God said injection of time he said Angels appear in the end time all the prophets in the signpost point to it in this day that angels will appear prophets will arise signs and wonders and if God did that for the those little Junctions back there what will he do now when all hell is turned loose all heaven will turn loose angels will appear signs and wonders on the earth another place he said the angels of God that's gone on Pursuit after these demon powers that have taken the People by force that God has sent his angels and they're here declaring the resurrection of the Lord Jesus the angels of God have been dispatched for the might from the presence of God with a commission to go search out the Sons and Daughters of God who had been taken by force and when they get in the midst of the Captivity to declare the resurrection of Jesus Christ and by the declaring of the Resurrection is the rebuking of the stronghold by the declaring of the Resurrection is the rebuking of the spirit of animal friends I didn't nothing else but Jesus Christ is alive and well and his power is here angels are here signs are here wonders are here amen and Satan I surely he says in the name of Jesus Christ by The Living Word now listen what Paul said he said I've not shunned so Paul didn't get scared he knew who was accompanied him he knew who was with him he knew who was revealing these things to him and he said I have not shunned to declare unto you all somebody say oh oh the counsel of God you say why are you saying that because remember son means to be willing to utter from Fear to be unwilling to utter what should be uttered for a spirit of fear now I'm going to take the gloves off and just preach for a second the prophet of God said one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear everybody is scared to death it's what's going to happen who what some of that some of that language brother Manuel what's going to happen who what listen the prophet he said it's the greatest curse on the church today is fear do you realize in your Bible over I think it's 365 times in your Bible the Bible refers Brother Sam to fear not do not be afraid the Bible gives you a promise for every day of the year the Bible gives you a promise for every day of the year not to live in fear not to walk in fear but then said watch the greatest curse on the church today is fear what did Jesus say he said fear not little flock it's your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom I love what Paul says to Timothy he said God hath not somebody say hath not hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power of power and of love and of a sound mind Brotherhood love is a powerful force he said there's nothing more strong than love he said love will make you trust love has no fear love casts out fear he says one of the greatest things I find among them is fear and what makes fear is a lack of confidence if you lack confidence it'll make you fear but if you love it Cast Away that fear and that's the way God wants his church amen not so many charter members he wants members that's loyal and loves and believes and has confidence in him he wants members and his Royal who loves him who believes him and who has confidence in what his Prophet was sent to the age to declare listen friends I'm going to do something right here I'm going to use my Liberty to rebuke the spirit of fear I'm going to use my license to rebuke the spirit of fear I'm going to use my Liberty right now to rebuke the spirit of fear you say why because spirit of fear is defeated it is held the church long enough I think it's time to lose the fear and get a hold of faith I think it's time to quit being scared and worried and nervous and tore up and if I say it what's going to happen and if I don't say what's going to happen if I raise my hand amen let me tell you what that is that ain't nothing but a devil of fear and fear is trespassed long enough I'll say Satan thou demon of fear you are on offense to me and I assure thee in the name of Jesus I bring every Spirit under my control to declare the word of God and by declaring the word of God I am rebuking the spirit of fear some of you all right now want to say Amen but there's a spirit of fear on you to utter the word amen you want to Rejoice so bad but there's a spirit of fear on you Amen to release yourself and enjoy the presence of God listen but to demon of fear is defeated in the name of smash build your mama it's hail to Daddy it's held your granddaddy it's held your grandmother it's held your church it's held your testimony but in the name of Jesus Christ I adjure Thee thou spirit of fear you are defeated in the name of Jesus Christ you have no rights in this pulpane you have no righteousness meaning as a matter of fact Let the Harry open up them doors and let that devil out of here we refuse to fear we refuse to be we are not a bunch of scared church members hiding out somewhere we are the manifested sons and knowledge of power and we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but the spirit of power and of love and of the sound mind you say preacher you're getting over an adoption well I am because the word is the adoption that I rebuke the spirit of fear by the adoption authority of the word you say preacher you're getting way out there am I really the prophet said there he died and he sent back the Holy Spirit and he said to this church you take this fight and you fight with it you follow me you shall receive power I'm preaching to you now after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem Judea and in Samaria and to the uttermost parts of the Earth and son shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils but I showed up tonight to put a whooping on the devil they shall cast out Devils they shall speak the new kinds they shall take up serpents they shall bring belly things if they drink it it shall not hurt him if they lay their hands on the sick if they lay their hands on the sick if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover you see what I'm doing I'm using my license to preach the liberty of Divine Healing and to declare that if I lay my hands on you if a man of God lays his hands on you under a Divine commission that devil has to flee that devil has to turn I want to tell that devil every disease is defeated every sickness is defeated every Cancer is defeated every torment and Gable of Hell or a tumor is defeated every condition I'm not a crazy man I'm a liberated man I have been liberated to believe in March 16 is an action and it's here tonight in full effect in full authority to release you from the bondage of legalism well preacher what no don't bring that fear back in here he's defeated [Applause] [Music] I know where I'm standing it's a spirit of fear probably God said the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of man is the Bible to be backed up for the holy ghost that Christ died at Calvary to free his church from Superstition and fear and doubt and trembling if you're trembling you're not free if you're following Superstition you're not free if you've got fear on your life you're not free but Jesus Christ the son of God died at Calvary to declare Freedom through Adam's pollen race he lives today he lives today if he lives today then fear ought to be dead if he lives today Superstition ought to be dead if he come on church if he lives today down ought to be dead he lives today he rose from the dead He's Alive Tonight here ye him [Applause] unless somebody will declare it how can you see unless somebody will declare how can you get free unless somebody will quit being a coward and preach the message of the hour how can our young people know that they're saying about your argument it's a reality unless somebody shut up the argument and get back to preaching the message and remember who we are what we're here for listen if I wanted to sit around arguing present time I'd go join a Baptist Council and we can do it every Monday morning but I'm not a Baptist I'm a seated Abraham and I am out of the license to believe God some of y'all say what do you talk about pleasure I'm talking about fussing with that devil that ought to be underneath your feet some of y'all give that devil management and that devil ought to be under your feet devil ought to be under your foot right now and you're letting him in your mind you're letting him tell you well if I do this this is going to happen and if I say that that's going to happen that is a devil from the prince of hell and I resent you Satan in the name of Jesus Christ Thou Art defeated [Applause] he has no rights in the house of God because Jesus Christ he lives today he rose from the dead He's Alive tonight and he sent me here on a Saturday night in the middle of Pawnee Oklahoma to declare unto you that God is the way the truth and the life he's the power and the Deliverance he's the power and the Salvation you ain't got to live in fear thank you you don't go to war with me let's go to Wars shall we fear is a spirit of intimidation and manipulation I told you never you better not show up fear is a spirit of intimidation and it's a spirit of manipulation and you know what fear will do fear will intimidate you and then it'll manipulate you fear will intimidate you and it will manipulate you you say preacher you're crazy am I really let's look at covet shall we for a minute let's look at Coleman I'm not here to argue with you about whether you believe it or not let's just look at it for a second

virus and we don't now patch amen but I just want to say this is a preacher I know people that died from covet I know people too but let me go into that devil he lost and they won Kobe did not win it did win the first time they tried it and if they tried again it won't win if they try every election between now and they'll come in the Lord it will never shut this right up it's a demon of fear now y'all know I'm telling the truth and some of some of what we're dealing with right now is side effects of a spirit of fear that moved into homes moved into churches moved into families why it's a spirit of fear it's got people now y'all know I'm telling the truth oh God can I preach by the window amen it's a spirit of intimidation so brother Sean they say if you go out you're going to catch it if you go to church you're going to catch it if you go to the wherever you go amen but but what did he do it changed the way people lived so it did not just intimidate for him it began to manipulate him listen you never went to Walmart with Thor mask on your face until intimidation come around come on you didn't well I know I didn't just laugh at me in this and then I didn't put turmax in all my cars amen before [Applause] but it's the truth now you say whatever Andrew I'm just more spiritually well maybe you are and God bless you but we're here today and we're defeating that fear some of y'all never stood out on the front porch and washed your vegetables before you brought them in you never went out there and sprayed Lysol on your bags from Walmart until a spirit of fear was released in this nation and it began to intimidate you and before long it began to manipulate well we might as well preach in Saturday night and I feel like cutting some Devil's heads off it's a spirit of fear so that was a natural spirit of fear but let's look at another spirit of fear in the last days is trying to manipulate the way we have our meetings come on it used to be we showed up and we didn't care who shouted who danced who had a prayer line who rejoiced in the Holy Ghost we didn't care what happened we was just happy to be there but some old long tongue devil called up out of the piss of hell and begin to spew his voice just breath out on the church and say well if we're not careful amen things are going to get out of hand and if we're not careful somebody might go through far let me tell you what that is that's a demon from the pits of hell it's a spirit of fear and I refuse to back up to it I used to lay my Bible down and let some devil let's crawl out of hell manipulate our meetings I refuse to let some devil manipulate our prayer lines I refuse for that Sun Devil manipulate these men of God that have given their lives to preach this gospel I may not be nobody and I know it but as long as I got a breath in my body and a bone in my body I'm going to declare war on that devil I'm gonna tell that devil you will not stop me this believe you will not stop me next meeting show up next time I'll still be shouting show up next time I'll still be rejoicing whether Andrew are you going to get scared they tried that on me when I was 13 years old and I'm still preaching the seven chills open because it's a spirit of fear and I refuse I refuse I refuse you where you are too too you all refused to come to a meeting and not say Amen because of what somebody gonna say about you you ought to refuse that devil and declare your Liberty it's a devil a fear of intimidation and manipulation and for long man we gonna be living in the basement again we're preachers this meeting safer is that meeting safe any meeting that's preaching the message is safe when in God's name did we become a butcher it's fear it's fear but I refuse to shine to declare the counsel of God for a spirit of fear now I'm just gonna I'm Gonna Keep On preaching it it's a spirit of fear I've I've confronted it it's a spirit of fear Ruble under things or not if it's not an order something might get out of hater something might get out of balance something listen do you realize what that is that devil that's running around here breathing his poisonous breath is the same devil six years ago that tried to say well shut all the preachers up and just play a tape but you know what happened there were some men of God who we salute Tonight We Salute You men of God you didn't take a knee brother Daryl you didn't pack up and go home you could have you could have enjoyed your home you could have enjoyed your family but you got on the field and you kept on preaching and you kept on sweating and you kept on praying and we thank you for the bear we thank you for not giving in listen I'm not a crazy man I know this man since I was a baby that's not an ounce of fear in that man's life he'll declare this gospel anywhere we thank you brother Manuel brother Jonathan we thank you brother Sean we thank you brother Kenny brother Kenny we thank you you do a lot of work overseas and we salute you and we thank you that you didn't let some devils intimidate you and manipulate you and say well you ought to stay home and you shouldn't go preach from the word but you've got out there and you drew a sword by the window we thank you for all these years you stood in this community ridicule make fun of like that criticized ostricher that you're still here declaring what your heart has heard fast we thank you for declaring this message and clear more come on church for the band we thank you we thank you for this Brother Sam we thank you for declaring this message and I want to go on record and say to every man of God Caleb we thank you you Jen giving your gift to some of the world but your sold your life after Jesus Christ we say thank you brother Jonas thank you for declaring this word and any man of God here at brother William we thank you for the for the Leo I held Rebecca I'm gonna get in trouble we thank you men of God brother Adam we thank you you're getting back up brother Tron brother Kelly how can we forget you brother Kelly you didn't been to opposition been through church problems been through situation amen but he still mounts the poor kid and through all the past Doctrine and all the ideas he still declares this message is the absolute to this generation mother Danny we thank you brother Danny amen you didn't have to leave the comfort of your home and go to Mongolia and live our sister Della you didn't have to do it but you did it and we thank you for declaring this message in Manitoba go on record Josh how can I miss you a young man ever deviled hell should have shut that boy up but he's not just here he's on fire he's got the Holy Ghost God raised the fat young man as a witness to more young men that there's a God who can deliver you from the night Seasons as a God who can rescue you what about it Church what about it there's a living God and that devil will not shut up this ministry oh God we need you we need men of God declare this message [Applause] well I think that devil got out of here couldn't stop us from preaching but now he changes he tactic and says well Don't Preach everything just preach certain parts you know because because if you're not careful you're gonna you're gonna get off the middle of the road you're gonna get in the ditching oh listen here you devil of fear fear is of the devil God don't want you to fear he wants you to believe you say why are you preaching this because the word rebukes the fear if I don't push back with a word the fear will take over but the word rebukes the fear see remember sitting now watch he goes to Isaac can I have a few more minutes he goes to Isaiah 35 verse 8 and he says in a highway shall be there and away and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfared man the fools shall not air therein now I'm going to take time and preach this to you the prophet of God said Isaiah said there would be a highway and Away conjunction it won't be called The Highway of Holiness it'll be called the way of Holiness see right in the middle of the road I'm still on my subject Liberty to declare another place you said and then when the rain comes it washes all the trash off on the side so if we're in the middle of the road and for the Leon brother Leo sorry some trash gets in the middle of the road we don't have to worry about getting it out ourselves when the rain falls the rain will wash the trash off and we'll just keep moving forward see that's the beauty of preaching the message is the word corrects the error so when the air shows up in the middle of the road we don't quit walking and focus on the air we just keep our eyes on the cross of Calvary and we just keep on walking because before long some rain's going to fall and when that rain falls it's going to rush all the trash off now y'all know I'm preaching the truth he says another place for ways in the middle of the road each side is where the all falls is found all falls isn't that something John all false and then that's where you're one this brother went to one side and you're trying to tan with the other side but the true message lays in the center of the road the true message is laid in the center so we don't have to go to the ditch to find it and pull it to the center it's already in the center the true message is this okay the true message not your message my message brother so and trust me but the true message lays in the center of the road another place in 1962 but now in the middle of the road in the scriptures lays out the truth you see where you're at amen the angel Lord and the another place and the Hours come when the American now let me back up I just identified to you we're the angel of the Lord is he's in the center [Music] well listen in the message he's in the center of the road I'm going somewhere he said now watch either some kind of fantastic or something isn't so cold starchy listen there's two classes he said hardly a middle of the road anymore oh can I keep on going 1959 well you know I always preach the middle of the road [Music] I always preach the minute so if you'll study what brother bam said and you'll just say it we don't have to worry about it if you're in the middle you're already in the middle just by saying what he said because every tape he's preaching is in the middle of the road in 47 55 52 61 63 come on just say what a prophet said and you'll automatically stay in the middle of the road you know I always somebody say always I always preach the middle of the road you know what I say brother Jonas I say thank God for prophetic teaching I say thank God for Prophet who always whether he was with the Oneness or the Tunis if he was with the freeness or if he was with the Full Gospel if he was with Jack Moore or he was with both but come on Sir if he would be Joseph Mo say wherever a prophet was he was preaching in the middle of the road because there was a bride that was going to follow this road she was going to walk the same path and she couldn't get in the ditch she had to stay hey you know I'm going somewhere amen what are you saying preacher I'm saying thank God for a prophet who preached the middle of the road even when he was being made fun of [Applause] with his own cousin brother Jonathan in Evansville Indiana said we heard brother Brown and preaching the middle of the road the other day you know what that guy said he said talk about preaching me on the road he said that's not good driving ethics that's not good driving ethics well last time I checked oh God last time I checked it's a one-way Road [Applause] it ain't a coming and a going it's one way you can't preach this message by laodicea's Road directions you can't preach this message by the Baptist idea they've been on the road turning coming they've made so many u-turns we're plumbed is it but thank God for a prophet who centered the gospel in the middle of the road and he got him a car and he began to preach it if they laughed gave me preaching if they made fun of me preaching you know what I say brother Tim I say if he could be criticized and stay in the middle of the road you better believe you can laugh at me make fun of me call me what you want to but I'm Gonna Stand where I Prophet stood I'm going to stand in the middle of the road and declare that Jesus Christ is right here well I'm feeling good and that Devil's that Devil's feeling bad and I'm feeling good bad driving ethics well let me just keep on preaching for a second have you forgot we're not being driven we're being led [Applause] have you forgot we're not being driven we're being led his brother his brother Duran here tonight God bless you brother during I know probably listen at home we had some brother Sean's living room one day and I never forget brother Sean brother Darren just spoke up and he said there's one way to identify Spirit he said it's the spirit of God it leads he said if it's a wrong Spirit it drives I got my phone out I put that note in my phone that's how I identify spirit is it lead me to do something or is it driving me to do something see if it's driving your shout it ain't coming from the spirit of God if it's dry come on church if it's driving you to do certain things it ain't coming from the spirit if it's driving you not to say Amen it's not coming from the spirit of God but if it's leading you well I feel good if it's leading you then there's liberty you say preach the lottery standing on the road because the only place Liberty can be found is in the middle of the road [Applause] you don't believe me let's go to the formal okay get over in the formal ditch and you can't shout you can't raise your hands you can't say Amen you can't dance if you cry you're too emotional if you snatch or two out of order amen there's all kinds of bondage well let's leave that side and let's go to the fanatical side if you ain't screaming running hollering shout amen you're out of the Earth but if you come to the middle of the road come over where the angel the Lord is if you come over the spirit of God is the proud of God said this he sent a Sweet Holy Spirit leads to church he said now what made the difference we just started getting a little arrogant oh God just starting to get little arrogant and different in our churches and the devil flew away he said but right in the middle of the road there's a true sound unadulterated gospel and the power of God right down to there taking the Kings and monarchs where anybody can stand in Search and they can see that it's the power of the almighty God not a fanaticism not a formality it's the power of God then why did Paul declare the demonstration of the spirit because theirs were the power of God is is not an enticing words it's not in man's directions the power of God is in the faith of God now I'm hurrying along I've got to close he said friends I've always listen to The Prophet I've always tried to keep a balance on the road but there's a middle of the road where the true sound same gospels priests and God moves in there don't you thank God now now somebody say well preacher why why are you so driving this point because the preacher the message is the adoption of the church can we agree with that the message of the hour is this okay the message of the hour is the adoption of the church probably God said the four gospel church is divided in two ways one of them is getting cold formal danger line next one getting a bunch of Mystic here in high things not even scripture stay right in the middle of the road see now you say preacher why he said because what you don't get on either side or your adoption will leave direct quote if you get on either side your adoption will leave and you'll revert back to a bunch of Pentecostals hollering the name Jesus without no manifestation because the authority of the name of God is in the adoption the church by the word of God let me just go ahead and move on and say this I'm going to stay in the middle of the road you know why I'm gonna stand in the Middle Road because I study a prophet and I found out if powerful things happen in the middle of the road you know I found out brother window I found out powerful things happen in the middle of the road you say really yes sir look at shamgar but him said he jumped out there amen God I say with that Ox plow got all choked up got to the gate he jumped out there in the middle of the road under this knowing he was a child of God stood in the middle of the road tondered to listings in one day ditch he was in the middle of the road riff and Philistines he whipped 600 Philistines in the middle of the road you know what else I found out I'm closing on this point I found out if you stay in the middle of the road healing is in the middle of the road you say really yeah you realize blind Bartimaeus the prophet of God said he was in the middle of the road and his faith stopped Jesus Ryan Bartimaeus was in the middle of the road and his faith stopped Jesus I'm going to tell you why the devil told me to preach this and I'm going to preach it get out of here damn boy in the middle of the road is the possibility for a miracle testing one two testing testing is still working middle of the other for a miracle that's why the devil don't want the church in the middle of the road and prove it to you by the message Father God said Saul was on his way down there to persecute Christians he said about midday he was coming right along the middle of the road and the first thing he knew the pillar of fire appeared and said Saul Saul why persecute us down well preacher what are you saying I say I'm going to sing in the middle of the road I'm going to shout in the middle of the road I'm going to preach in the middle of the road I'm going to dance in the middle of the road I'm gonna grow in the middle of the road I'm going to rejoice in the middle of the road I'm going to preach this message in the middle of the road I'm going to have prayer lines in the middle of the road I'm going to have altar calls in the middle of the road I'm going to lay hands on the sick and I'm going to watch him recover in the middle of the road I'm going to watch Sinners be saved in the middle of the road I'm going to watch homosexual Devils leave our young people in the middle of the road I'm going to watch blindness and cancer be the head in the middle you ain't pulling me off in some ditch and causing me to lose my adoption if I got a fight or fight but I'm gonna stay where prophets do the good things I feel like dancing brother window good things happen in the middle of the road I I said good things happen in them you say preacher I've been laughtastic cause I'm in the middle of the road you're in a position for something good to happen [Applause] brother I've been ridiculed because I'm straight but stay there that's where the angel is that's where the anointing is that's where the Liberty is [Applause] you say preacher you lost your mind I got the mind to Christ cause it's in the middle of the road [Applause] now now very oh God I just gotta close there's no battle there's no battle whatsoever until you declare all the counsel of God and take your Liberty whatever you say preacher you're awful far out there now I'm in the middle of the road under adoption I'm not under the spirit of fear how can I preach this out of here if we're under the spirit of fear demons will take over the church we'll be hollering in the ditch and homosexuality Devils packing our babies out we'll be hollering around about well this and pornography devils gripping the lives of our young people listen you may hate me time I get done I'll still love you let's stay in the middle of the road good things happen I preacher you're getting way out there am I really I make a declaration of war tonight I declare war on that devil I declare well I

proud of God said the enemy made a challenge he said now watch the enemy speaks today the enemy tries to say the days of Miracles has passed no such a thing as the baptism the Holy Ghost this is only

of the living you realize what a generation is declared by it's declared by a seed but at 33 and a half years he was cut off but remember the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy listen to this in Psalms 22 verse 22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the congregation when I praise thee ye that fear the Lord praise him all ye that seed of Jacob glorify him and fear Him all ye the sin of Israel verse 30 verse 30 a seed Shall Serve him a seed Shall Serve him it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation they shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born that he hath done this well I'll tell you why the devil hates you Silas is you're a part of that reserved seed oh God you're a part of that reserved seed that the devil thought he would heal when he cut him off but the Bible prophesied and said there'll be a seed that'll rise out of Jacob there'll be a seed that'll rise up it'll be an abrahamic seed and my seed shall possess the gates of his enemy he reserved himself a seed he reserved himself a scene when everybody's losing their mind when the world's Pawn apart there is a bride who's a part of a seed that has
