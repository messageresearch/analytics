[1:03:09] morning
[1:03:10] hey man there ought to be a stronger
[1:03:12] Amen to that word amen our God is not
[1:03:15] just our God he's our friend amen and
[1:03:18] we're a friend to him we sure appreciate
[1:03:20] you brother Andrew and appreciate your
[1:03:21] labors this morning in the word we want
[1:03:24] to look here in the book of Jeremiah the
[1:03:25] first chapter
[1:03:26] and in the fourth verse of Jeremiah 1.
[1:03:31] the Bible says then the word of the Lord
[1:03:33] came unto me saying
[1:03:35] before I form thee in thy belly I knew
[1:03:38] thee and before thou came this forth out
[1:03:41] of the womb I Sanctified thee
[1:03:43] and I ordained thee a prophet unto the
[1:03:46] Nations
[1:03:47] then said I ah Lord God behold I cannot
[1:03:51] speak for I Am a Child
[1:03:53] but the Lord said unto me say not I am a
[1:03:56] child
[1:03:57] for Thou shalt go to all that I shall
[1:04:00] send thee and whatsoever I command thee
[1:04:02] Thou shalt speak
[1:04:03] be not afraid of their faces for I am
[1:04:05] with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord
[1:04:08] then the Lord put forth his hand and
[1:04:10] touched my mouth and the Lord said unto
[1:04:13] me behold I have put my words in thy
[1:04:16] mouth how many could say Lord put your
[1:04:18] words in my mouth behold I have put my
[1:04:22] words in thy mouth see I have this day
[1:04:25] set thee over the Nations and over the
[1:04:27] kingdoms now notice this to root out and
[1:04:30] to pull down and to destroy and to throw
[1:04:32] down to build and to plant amen I
[1:04:36] believe we can say the words of a
[1:04:38] prophet are powerful words
[1:04:39] they can tear down they can pull down
[1:04:41] they can root out they can destroy they
[1:04:44] can throw down but they can also build
[1:04:46] and they can also plant now I also want
[1:04:49] to look with you in the Book of Daniel
[1:04:50] the ninth chapter
[1:04:52] The Book of Daniel the ninth chapter and
[1:04:54] we want to look in the first verse those
[1:04:57] of you that have read the book of Daniel
[1:04:59] you know that it can very well be called
[1:05:01] The Book of Revelation in the Old
[1:05:03] Testament The Book of Daniel
[1:05:05] is a very powerful book
[1:05:07] speaking of end time events in Daniel
[1:05:09] the ninth chapter
[1:05:11] in the first verse
[1:05:15] everybody love the Lord
[1:05:18] in the first year of Darius the son of
[1:05:21] assurus of the seed of the medes which
[1:05:24] was made King over the realm of the
[1:05:26] Chaldeans now in the first year of his
[1:05:28] reign I Daniel understood by books
[1:05:33] the number of the years were of the word
[1:05:35] of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet
[1:05:37] that he would accomplish 70 years in the
[1:05:40] desolations of Jerusalem now whatever
[1:05:44] Daniel was reading was not just a story
[1:05:46] but it was actually something that moved
[1:05:48] Daniel
[1:05:49] because in the very next verse it says
[1:05:51] and I set my face unto the Lord God so
[1:05:54] whatever he was reading moved him into
[1:05:56] desperation I set my face unto the Lord
[1:05:59] God to seek by prayer and supplications
[1:06:02] with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes now
[1:06:07] I also want to read one other verse with
[1:06:08] you in the Book of John the 15th chapter
[1:06:10] in the 16th verse I know you all will
[1:06:12] know this verse by heart
[1:06:15] and I just want to pull something here
[1:06:17] in John 15 and verse 16. Jesus you're
[1:06:21] speaking uh we could very well call John
[1:06:24] 15 the fruit chapter
[1:06:26] and he's speaking of the True Vine and
[1:06:27] he comes in the 16th verse and says ye
[1:06:31] have not chosen me
[1:06:33] but I have chosen you
[1:06:36] ye have not chosen me but I have chosen
[1:06:39] you and notice this word and ordained
[1:06:42] you that ye should go and bring forth
[1:06:45] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[1:06:47] that whatsoever ye shall ask of the
[1:06:50] father in my name he may give it to you
[1:06:53] amen we ask the Lord this evening to add
[1:06:56] the blessing and to the reading of his
[1:06:57] word as you can be seated here I want
[1:06:59] tonight maybe for just a few moments if
[1:07:02] I could I want to speak to you here on
[1:07:04] the thought of something that the Lord
[1:07:05] has just been dealing with my heart very
[1:07:08] heavily on the last few months and I
[1:07:10] want to title this tonight ordained to
[1:07:12] the message by the spirit
[1:07:15] ordained to the message by the spirit I
[1:07:18] believe as message ministers that we
[1:07:20] have been given a commission by the
[1:07:22] almighty God not by Pastor or by a
[1:07:24] preacher or by anyone a bishop but I
[1:07:27] believe we've been given a commission by
[1:07:28] the almighty God through a Vindicated
[1:07:30] prophet and I believe that is to preach
[1:07:33] the people amen into higher Heights and
[1:07:36] deeper debts amen I I don't believe that
[1:07:38] God is calling us just to be a surface
[1:07:40] Christians I don't believe he's calling
[1:07:42] us just to take up to space on a Pew but
[1:07:44] I believe that there is a purpose Amen
[1:07:46] in the reason why we're seeing the
[1:07:48] things we're seeing we're believing the
[1:07:49] things we're believing we're hearing the
[1:07:51] things we're hearing it's because there
[1:07:53] are deeper depths and there are higher
[1:07:55] Heights now the prophet of God says it
[1:07:57] like this he said the word uh must be
[1:07:59] established in our hearts he said as a
[1:08:02] minister you must never establish
[1:08:04] yourself in the heart of the people he
[1:08:06] said but you've got to establish the
[1:08:08] word in the heart of the people because
[1:08:09] it's not the preacher that will overcome
[1:08:11] the devil anytime anywhere any place but
[1:08:14] it's the word that will overcome the
[1:08:16] devil Anytime Anyplace anywhere under
[1:08:18] any condition the word will defeat the
[1:08:21] Devil now really what got my heart on
[1:08:24] this thought is and does God ever change
[1:08:25] his mind about his word brother Ben
[1:08:27] comes there and he's in in
[1:08:28] Jeffersonville and he's actually going
[1:08:30] to have a service where he's going to
[1:08:32] ordain men to preach the gospel he's
[1:08:34] going to ordain Ministry and he says it
[1:08:36] like this in paragraph 42 he says here
[1:08:38] comes a brother anybody know our brother
[1:08:40] Merlin Anthony now some of you may know
[1:08:43] that name he was a pastor I believe
[1:08:45] brother Joe would know he was a pastor
[1:08:46] over in Louisiana years of years their
[1:08:49] pastoring brother Matt asked the
[1:08:50] question he says does anybody know him
[1:08:52] well he's new to me he said oh that's
[1:08:54] right see he's with the Salvation Army
[1:08:56] remember he said remember me remember
[1:08:58] him said oh yes I remember from the
[1:09:00] Salvation Army that's right I remember

[1:09:05] look familiar to me but now I know him
[1:09:07] he said how many knows him to be a man
[1:09:09] of God the congregation says amen they

[1:09:15] working with him raise your hand he said
[1:09:17] amen will you pray for him amen he said
[1:09:20] now brother we know that you're coming
[1:09:21] from a great group of people the
[1:09:23] Salvation Army there are great people
[1:09:25] the Salvation Army does a great work out
[1:09:27] on the street we can say nothing against
[1:09:29] the Nazarene we can say nothing against
[1:09:31] the Pentecostal church or the Salvation
[1:09:33] Army or any of them they are our
[1:09:35] Brethren but do you see we believe that
[1:09:37] we are carriers of a great message for
[1:09:40] this very hour that we're living in we
[1:09:42] believe that we are are carriers of a
[1:09:44] great message for this very hour that
[1:09:46] we're living in you want to do that with
[1:09:48] us and brother Anthony says amen now
[1:09:51] what I draw from that is brother Branham
[1:09:53] was not there to attack and then the
[1:09:55] Salvation Army for what they were doing
[1:09:57] he was not there to attack and then the
[1:09:59] Pentecostals or the nazarenes for what
[1:10:01] they were doing amen but that was not
[1:10:03] his purpose upon the Earth amen was not
[1:10:06] to ordain people to carry a
[1:10:08] denominational message amen but his
[1:10:10] purpose upon the Earth was to ordain
[1:10:12] people who would carry the message of
[1:10:14] the hour and I'll say it to you like
[1:10:16] this amen as a young person we can't
[1:10:18] help what others do we can't help amen
[1:10:20] what churches they go to we can't help
[1:10:22] but doctrines they believe amen but I
[1:10:24] want to drive this home if everything
[1:10:26] within me tonight amen you were not
[1:10:28] ordained to denomination you were you
[1:10:30] were not ordained to the societies of
[1:10:32] laodicea you you were not ordained to
[1:10:35] just just an emotion or just a feeling
[1:10:37] but you was ordained to a message and it
[1:10:39] was not amen a message of a man it was
[1:10:42] the message of the king therefore
[1:10:44] tonight I can say before you was ever
[1:10:46] even born and come into the Earth amen
[1:10:48] you was ordained to believe this message
[1:10:50] you was ordained Amen to hear the voice
[1:10:53] of the seventh angel I think it's
[1:10:55] powerful when Jeremiah says before I
[1:10:57] form thee in my belly amen I knew thee
[1:10:59] and before thou came us forth out of the
[1:11:01] womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained
[1:11:04] thee Prophet unto the nation now this
[1:11:06] word ordained is very powerful it means
[1:11:08] to give it means to bestow it means to
[1:11:10] Grant it means to permit it means to
[1:11:12] ascribe it means to employ it means to
[1:11:15] devote to consecrate Amen to dedicate to
[1:11:18] commit to entrust to give over he meant
[1:11:20] to yield produce so brother Ram says it
[1:11:22] like this he said before Jeremiah was
[1:11:25] even brought from his mother's womb amen
[1:11:27] God said he knew him and he Sanctified
[1:11:30] him and he ordained him a prophet to the
[1:11:32] nation see before he ever come from his
[1:11:35] mother's womb amen he already had a seal
[1:11:38] of the ordination of God upon his life
[1:11:40] amen amen before he ever even broke his
[1:11:42] mother's womb home amen the hand of God
[1:11:45] was already upon that child and I'm just
[1:11:47] going to go ahead and say it before you
[1:11:48] ever broke the womb of your Earthly
[1:11:50] mother amen God's hand was already upon
[1:11:53] you amen and it was not in the form of a
[1:11:55] physical hand amen but it was in the
[1:11:57] form of a predestinated seat listen amen
[1:12:00] you cannot outrun the predestination of
[1:12:03] God Amen you cannot change the
[1:12:05] predestination of God amen amen family

[1:24:32] have no education they didn't have no
[1:24:35] abilities but they had a voice and they
[1:24:37] had a heart and they had a spirit that
[1:24:39] was willing and able to be surrendered

[1:25:17] unto you a feeling he's not here in
[1:25:19] party unto you a sensation he is
[1:25:21] imparted unto you the message and the
[1:25:24] message is Messiah is here now can we
[1:25:27] say that together Messiah is here now
[1:25:30] amen the Messiah is here now my then I
[1:25:33] Proclaim with everything within me we
[1:25:36] have a message for this day
[1:25:39] we have an announcement for this day
[1:25:41] brother Joel We got a declaration for
[1:25:43] this day we got a promise for this day
[1:25:46] we've got a good thing that's been given
[1:25:48] to the church we have a message for this
[1:25:50] day we believe that God has given us a
[1:25:54] message amen see the part of God said
[1:25:56] people wonder about this message they
[1:25:58] say well what do you mean when you make
[1:25:59] this remark the message of this hour
[1:26:01] what they are getting at amen is God's
[1:26:04] promise of this hour see that he
[1:26:06] promised what he would do and we see him
[1:26:09] scripturally vindicating just exactly
[1:26:11] what he said he would do Amen in the
[1:26:13] same manner foretold it in the scripture
[1:26:16] exactly because it's God saying it amen
[1:26:19] this message is not the voice of a
[1:26:22] seventh grade educated amen Kentucky
[1:26:25] hillbilly this message is the words of
[1:26:28] God come on Church the same God that God
[1:26:30] in Jeremiah's mouth is the same God that
[1:26:33] God and William branham's mouth and he
[1:26:35] was not speaking according to the
[1:26:37] kingdoms of the world he was living in
[1:26:38] he was speaking according to the coming
[1:26:41] Kingdom which was where the Messiah
[1:26:42] would Rule and Reign Old Church of the
[1:26:44] Living God don't you see who you are
[1:26:46] tonight you are the kingdom of the Holy
[1:26:48] Ghost you are the living dwelling
[1:26:50] Tabernacle that God has chosen to come
[1:26:53] into
[1:26:54] well brother Andrew I don't think I'm
[1:26:57] much on your eyes or not amen but in
[1:26:59] God's eyes or something because God
[1:27:01] bypass people that spending thousands of
[1:27:04] thousands of thousands of dollars to
[1:27:06] understand this Bible and we got young
[1:27:08] people sitting right here tonight amen
[1:27:10] they can take the scriptures and can tie
[1:27:12] theologians and Corners amen because
[1:27:14] it's not an education it's not a family
[1:27:16] lineage it's a specific purpose amen
[1:27:19] that the almighty God birthed you in
[1:27:22] this generation for
[1:27:25] you say then why are you why why are you
[1:27:28] throwing amen everything you got at this
[1:27:30] message because this message is Christ
[1:27:33] I know people think it's pictures but
[1:27:35] it's Christ I know they think it's
[1:27:37] doctrines but it's Christ can I take my
[1:27:39] Liberty brother Wendell I know they
[1:27:41] think it's a bunch of artifacts but this
[1:27:43] message is Christ and the promise that
[1:27:45] we've not come together Amen to talk
[1:27:47] about the message amen but we'll come
[1:27:49] together to get in the message and the
[1:27:51] message is Christ and he is the word
[1:27:54] than we are to get into it we are to get
[1:27:57] beneath it now if you get in the message
[1:28:00] the message becomes your absolute if you
[1:28:03] get in the message amen amen if you
[1:28:05] don't want me to preach don't push back
[1:28:06] this message is an absolute
[1:28:09] well brother Andrew it's not the Baptist
[1:28:11] absolute you're exactly right because we
[1:28:13] were not ordained to preach Baptist
[1:28:14] Doctrine we was ordained to carry a
[1:28:16] message I can't help but the southern
[1:28:18] baptist is doing amen but this is a
[1:28:20] bride you're a young person anointed and
[1:28:23] a clip for this generation and God did
[1:28:25] not send you into this age and equipped
[1:28:26] he equipped you with his word with his
[1:28:28] presence and we got to get into it we
[1:28:31] got to get beneath it it's the headship
[1:28:33] to the body now how many knows that God
[1:28:35] is perfected in threes
[1:28:38] God is perfected In Praise program said
[1:28:41] father son Holy Ghost three in one right
[1:28:43] amen God water pot Spirit three and one
[1:28:46] amen see God is perfected in priests now
[1:28:49] how many hear this this evening you have
[1:28:51] heard the term amen three pulls
[1:28:55] you've heard that term amen that there
[1:28:57] are three pools now the message then
[1:28:58] that we're speaking of has come to the
[1:29:00] church in three pools
[1:29:03] the prophet of God says in 1962 is this
[1:29:06] the sign of the answer he said or is
[1:29:08] this that he's asking questions he said
[1:29:10] is this that that third pool he told me
[1:29:12] three or four years ago see the first
[1:29:14] pull do you remember what happened I
[1:29:16] tried to explain it don't do that he
[1:29:18] said then the second pulley said don't
[1:29:20] try and I pulled anyhow do you remember
[1:29:22] and then he said now there's a third
[1:29:24] pull coming but don't try to explain it
[1:29:26] see now I approached this tonight I
[1:29:28] don't know but I feel Duty bound to
[1:29:31] approach my church to say something and
[1:29:34] you draw your own conclusion now when a
[1:29:36] prophet introduces that third pull to
[1:29:38] you as a Believer he automatically turns
[1:29:40] to John 14 12 and says the works that I
[1:29:43] do say you do also remember I'm saying
[1:29:46] now watch I know the King James says
[1:29:48] greater amen but you couldn't do nothing
[1:29:50] greater amen see he was in one person
[1:29:53] amen so it's more of it then he was in
[1:29:55] one person amen but he's in the whole
[1:29:58] church now amen so back then he was in
[1:30:01] one individual body member manifesting
[1:30:04] himself amen but now he's in the whole
[1:30:06] church then more than this you shall do
[1:30:08] for I go unto my father remember said if
[1:30:11] this is the third pull then there is a
[1:30:13] great ministry lying ahead I don't know
[1:30:15] I can't say I don't know now you say
[1:30:18] brother Andrew why what brother Branham
[1:30:19] labor on the points amen that the third
[1:30:21] pool cannot be impersonated amen because
[1:30:24] the third pool was the word amen and the
[1:30:27] word cannot be impersonated you cannot
[1:30:30] mimic this word amen you cannot put on
[1:30:32] this word amen you cannot you cannot
[1:30:34] come on church amen this word has got to
[1:30:37] be born into you amen by a specific
[1:30:40] purpose then the product God said the
[1:30:42] third pool cannot be impersonated
[1:30:43] because it is the word he said see then
[1:30:46] the third pool is the place where he
[1:30:48] promised to meet the believer amen we we
[1:30:51] do believe the message you're right amen
[1:30:53] the third pole was the sword in the hand
[1:30:55] in Sabino Canyon now the proud of God
[1:30:58] comes in indictment and says may there
[1:31:00] come forth a Revival of the just and at
[1:31:02] great power coming among the church just
[1:31:04] before it's gone it's not hard to pray
[1:31:06] that because you promised it amen and
[1:31:09] we're looking Lord for that third poor
[1:31:11] that we know will do great things for us
[1:31:13] in our midst amen 1963 why Christ speak
[1:31:16] God give me courage to take the sword of
[1:31:19] the word that he put into my hand about
[1:31:21] 33 years ago and hold it and marched
[1:31:24] forward to the third pillow it is my
[1:31:26] prayer amen Christ is the mystery of God
[1:31:28] revealed 1963 of course being spiritual
[1:31:31] you watch spiritual things not knowing
[1:31:34] this but God knows it if you'll turn
[1:31:36] around and look at the clock it's on the
[1:31:38] dot two o'clock amen the second pool
[1:31:40] amen it's the end of the second pool and
[1:31:43] the third pull is at hand amen a
[1:31:46] Vindicated Prophet stands upon the Earth
[1:31:48] amen not now stay with me tonight amen
[1:31:50] stands upon the Earth and declares to
[1:31:52] this generation amen that the second
[1:31:54] pull of my Ministry has come to its end
[1:31:57] we have now come to that third pull and
[1:31:59] he uses these words amen the third pool
[1:32:02] is at hand and amen the third pole is at
[1:32:05] hand now we can go back in the Bible in
[1:32:08] Daniel 12 4 and find where the Bible
[1:32:09] says Thou old Daniel Amen shut up the
[1:32:12] words amen and syllabus even to the time
[1:32:15] of the end for many shall run to and fro
[1:32:17] and knowledge shall be increased we can
[1:32:20] go from Daniel 12 to Revelation 1 3 and
[1:32:22] he says blessed is he that readeth and
[1:32:24] they that hear the words of this
[1:32:25] prophecy and keep those things which are
[1:32:28] written therein amen for the time is at
[1:32:31] hand amen we can go to the end of
[1:32:33] revelation 22 and verse 10 and the Bible
[1:32:36] says this seal not the Saiyans amen of
[1:32:39] the prophecy of this book amen for the
[1:32:41] time is at hand I'm on Church of
[1:32:44] prophets standing on the earth
[1:32:45] announcing to this generation amen that
[1:32:48] the second floor amen is now come to
[1:32:50] attend but there's a third Point listen
[1:32:52] amen I'm going to preach tonight or I'm
[1:32:54] going to burst you are not a generation
[1:32:56] of church members you are not an
[1:32:58] emotional worked up but your young
[1:33:00] people you are the generation that has
[1:33:02] come to the IMAX of seven Aces I'm on
[1:33:05] charge amen we're not standing at the
[1:33:07] foot of the pyramid we have climbed to
[1:33:09] the top we're not standing Amen on the
[1:33:12] first Corral we've climbed Seven Peaks
[1:33:14] we have come to the climax of The
[1:33:16] revelation of the word of God it's time
[1:33:18] to break out of this whole church entity
[1:33:20] this whole formal idea amen quit letting
[1:33:23] denomination Define what the house of
[1:33:25] God ought to be it shouldn't be a cold
[1:33:27] formal intellectual Starship stiff-neck
[1:33:30] place it ought to be a place of Liberty
[1:33:32] it ought to be a place of authority
[1:33:36] and the only way it's going to come in
[1:33:38] the church is by the word for the season
[1:33:40] of the age you're living in oh somebody
[1:33:43] shouting the time is at hand
[1:33:45] the time is at hand
[1:33:47] the problem that God said they're in the
[1:33:49] wisdom and the economy of God this
[1:33:51] Mighty Revelation through faith known to
[1:33:53] God could not come forth hitherto thus
[1:33:56] we immediately learn a principle that
[1:33:58] for Revelation for God of God for each
[1:34:01] age can come in that age only and at a
[1:34:05] specific time oh preach preacher think I
[1:34:08] believe I will the revelation of God can
[1:34:11] only come at a specific time you know
[1:34:14] why it's got to be a specific time
[1:34:15] because there's got to be a specific
[1:34:17] person upon the Earth that has been born
[1:34:20] for the specific purpose of the specific
[1:34:22] Revelation that is being released in the
[1:34:25] specific time in the history of Israel
[1:34:27] the revelation of God come to Moses only
[1:34:30] at a specific time of history and even
[1:34:32] more specifically it came as the people
[1:34:35] Cried unto God Jesus himself came at the
[1:34:39] fullness of time he being the complete
[1:34:41] revelation of the godhead and in this
[1:34:44] layout of cnh the revelation of God will
[1:34:47] come in it's due time it will not falter
[1:34:50] and it will not be premature think on
[1:34:52] this and take heed to it for we are in
[1:34:54] the end time today so a prophet stands
[1:34:57] there young people and announces to you
[1:34:59] the third poll is at hand he takes you
[1:35:02] to Daniel 12. he takes you to Revelation

[1:35:08] shows you what's been sealed has now
[1:35:10] been unsealed come on do you realize

[1:35:20] ago today young people a prophet stood
[1:35:22] in Jeffersonville and preached the
[1:35:24] revelation of the Seven Seals and he
[1:35:27] opened it with the God who was revealed
[1:35:29] in Simplicity listen we're not here
[1:35:31] playing Church we're an Enoch bride
[1:35:33] we're in a translation season we're in a
[1:35:36] time where it's time to throw down every
[1:35:38] idea it's time to throw down every
[1:35:40] tradition it's time to come back to the
[1:35:42] homeland of the church and the homeland
[1:35:44] of the church is not a personality it's
[1:35:47] not a special perfect creature it's the
[1:35:49] message of the hour I say we ought to
[1:35:51] lift it up tonight we ought to lift up
[1:35:53] the message
[1:35:56] we are to tear every tradition down and
[1:35:59] lift up the message

[1:36:20] beginning to move within me he comes and
[1:36:22] Look Away to Jesus and says so now I'm
[1:36:24] going to say something to you that I
[1:36:26] haven't said all along and that is the
[1:36:28] thing we've looked forward to so long

[1:36:33] Vindicated
[1:36:35] it was come
[1:36:37] 's way but time was at hand he began to
[1:36:40] feel it moving within him he said but
[1:36:42] now it's been Vindicated and I'm sure
[1:36:44] you all know what it is everyone knows
[1:36:47] that the third pill is properly
[1:36:49] identified we know where it is so the
[1:36:52] third pull is here
[1:36:54] we've come from the third pool is coming
[1:36:56] we've come from the third promise at
[1:36:58] hand we have come from I feel the third
[1:37:00] pool movement I feel it moving within me
[1:37:02] it's been Vindicated it's properly
[1:37:05] identified and he now says the third
[1:37:07] pool is here well listen he's not here
[1:37:10] tonight so does that mean the third pull
[1:37:12] is not here amen I tell you what that is
[1:37:14] that's a doctrine of devils that has
[1:37:16] tried to you young people to
[1:37:18] believe that you got to sit back and
[1:37:20] wait on something to come I propose to
[1:37:22] you that your Revival is not coming your
[1:37:25] Revival is here it's time to shake out
[1:37:27] of the layout to see it amen sleepy
[1:37:30] condition of lukewarm formal ideas and
[1:37:32] realize whatever was in a prophet is in
[1:37:35] the bride
[1:37:38] whatever he felt moving I feel it moving
[1:37:41] here tonight whatever he felt
[1:37:43] influencing his sermons I feel an
[1:37:46] influence in mind
[1:37:49] the third poll is here he said see it's
[1:37:52] so sacred that I mustn't say much about
[1:37:54] it he said now watch that third pull
[1:37:57] amen it will be to the absolutely total
[1:37:59] lost he said but it will be for the
[1:38:01] bride and the church now we've come from
[1:38:04] the third pool is coming I pray this is
[1:38:06] okay we've come from the third pull is
[1:38:08] coming the third pull is here the third
[1:38:10] pull is moving within me amen now he
[1:38:13] says we know what the third pulley is
[1:38:14] it's to the total loss amen but it is
[1:38:17] for the bride there is no more doubt in
[1:38:20] my mind I know what that third pool is
[1:38:23] and I know what it does he said the
[1:38:25] third pool has confirmed the first rule
[1:38:28] then one time he said about it he said
[1:38:30] there would come by this one way then it
[1:38:32] would come by knowing the heart amen but
[1:38:34] then the spoken word do you see who you
[1:38:36] are young people you are not a
[1:38:38] generation of feelings you are not a
[1:38:41] generation of superstition you are a
[1:38:43] generation that has come back under the
[1:38:45] Spoken Word by the voice of the seventh
[1:38:48] angel we all know oh that's the
[1:38:49] identification we know what the third
[1:38:52] pool is he said the third poll is that
[1:38:54] great and final pull he said see when
[1:38:57] the day the messenger starts on to
[1:38:59] declare his message amen the first pool
[1:39:01] was healing the second pool was
[1:39:03] prophesied and the third poor amen is
[1:39:06] the opening of the word it's the
[1:39:09] Mysteries revealed and there's no more
[1:39:11] higher order to reveal the word than
[1:39:13] prophets and the only one that can have
[1:39:15] Vindicated his word and remember the
[1:39:18] third pull was the opening of them Seven
[1:39:20] Seals to reveal the hidden truth that
[1:39:23] has been sealed in the word come on
[1:39:25] Church you are not looking at a book of
[1:39:27] symbols amen if you are from under this
[1:39:30] message Revelation is a book of symbols
[1:39:32] to you if you're out from under the
[1:39:34] teaching this seventh angel amen it's
[1:39:35] all about you it's all about your
[1:39:37] doctrines remember if you'll come
[1:39:39] beneath the spirit if you'll come
[1:39:40] beneath the word it'll go from a symbol
[1:39:43] to a revelation it'll go from a question
[1:39:45] to An Answer it'll go from a confusion
[1:39:48] to an understanding I say oh God release
[1:39:51] the anoint to the Holy Ghost to bring a
[1:39:53] young person under the authority
[1:39:57] of the message of the hour or the per
[1:39:59] living in now he said it very plainly
[1:40:01] it's to reveal is to unseal the third
[1:40:04] pull is the message
[1:40:08] well I feel like shouting on that Thomas
[1:40:11] the third pool is the message you say
[1:40:13] brother Andrew what is the third pull
[1:40:15] it's the message what is the message
[1:40:16] it's the third pool what is the third
[1:40:18] pool is the opening of the word it's
[1:40:20] creation by the spoken word it's
[1:40:22] creation power it's preaching the total
[1:40:24] loss but come on Church you're not the
[1:40:26] total loss tonight and you're not Hattie
[1:40:28] rights but you're the little faith woman
[1:40:30] you're the elect lady and you're in
[1:40:33] position tonight to receive the spoken
[1:40:35] word
[1:40:38] some people say well we ought to be
[1:40:40] casual about this message well I thank
[1:40:42] God he didn't send us a casual prophet
[1:40:47] somebody told me not long ago then we
[1:40:49] need to put the gloves on and preach
[1:40:50] this message to young people I said no
[1:40:52] we need to take the gloves off and
[1:40:53] preach it to him
[1:40:57] I got my mind on this message it's that
[1:41:00] third pull it's the one I must be loyal
[1:41:02] to and it's the one I must be reverent
[1:41:05] to it's the one that's a sacred poor
[1:41:07] it's a loyal poor it's a reverent poor
[1:41:11] you say then what is it it's the message
[1:41:12] the word in the church making you the
[1:41:15] bride if he is not Elie so you're not
[1:41:18] Rebecca and you're not on your way to
[1:41:20] see Isaac but if he is Eli Easter then
[1:41:22] you are Rebecca and the next thing is to
[1:41:25] see Isaac
[1:41:28] [Applause]

[1:41:33] 4 then we're headed for tribulation if
[1:41:36] this is not Luke 17 30 then we're still
[1:41:38] stuck in the tombs of denomination but I
[1:41:41] propose to you that this is Luke 17 30.
[1:41:44] this is Malachi poor this is revelation
[1:41:46] 10. this is revelation 5. this is

[1:41:58] it moving I feel it breathing I feel it
[1:42:01] pulsating I feel the charge of the
[1:42:03] spoken word coming in the church
[1:42:08] give way to the name of Jesus give way
[1:42:11] to the authority of the message of the
[1:42:13] hour
[1:42:14] [Applause]
[1:42:16] it's the word in the church it's the
[1:42:18] church becoming the bride it's the young
[1:42:20] person becoming the overcomer
[1:42:24] if this message is not the truth then
[1:42:26] you're not the Invincible Army
[1:42:29] if this message is not for truth then
[1:42:31] you're not more than a conqueror if this
[1:42:34] message is not the truth you're not an
[1:42:36] overcomer
[1:42:38] foreign
[1:42:40] but it is the truth
[1:42:44] [Applause]
[1:42:50] this air
[1:42:53] Heavenly Father we are gratefully said
[1:42:56] to see the Risen Messiah 1900 years of
[1:43:00] all kinds of Theology and movements but
[1:43:02] still in the darkness of all of it you
[1:43:05] promised you would appear here in the
[1:43:06] last days in the day that shot him and
[1:43:09] you would make yourself known to the
[1:43:10] children of Abraham but called the
[1:43:12] elected and here you are tonight here
[1:43:15] you are tonight after 1900 years you're
[1:43:19] just as much alive tonight as you was
[1:43:22] when you talked to the woman at the
[1:43:23] whale it's God manifested in flesh now
[1:43:26] in the flesh of his bride
[1:43:28] are you seeing at church amen it was in
[1:43:31] the flesh of his son but now it's in the
[1:43:34] flesh of his bride see it's God
[1:43:36] manifested in flesh for the bride and
[1:43:38] the husband is the same self-flesh these
[1:43:42] two are one and the church is becoming
[1:43:45] the bride by believing the word so that
[1:43:47] the word in the church becomes the same
[1:43:49] amen the word and the church making it
[1:43:53] to bride it's the last sign it is God
[1:43:56] identifying himself his word in his
[1:43:59] church
[1:44:01] if I could oh God I wish I was a
[1:44:03] preacher right now if there was some way
[1:44:05] I Could Break Your Eyes Open to see amen
[1:44:07] that your flesh is becoming the word and
[1:44:10] this word is becoming your flesh
[1:44:14] if you could see that it's not a Bible
[1:44:15] story if you could see that it's not a
[1:44:18] history lesson if you could see that
[1:44:19] it's not a Doctrine if you could say
[1:44:21] it's not a church you attend it's the
[1:44:24] person of Jesus Christ coming into his
[1:44:26] church by the side of this Resurrection
[1:44:29] I'm going to go ahead and say it my God
[1:44:31] is not dead He's Alive
[1:44:34] my God is not in the Tomb in Jerusalem
[1:44:37] and neither is he in a tomb and
[1:44:39] Jeffersonville but my God is alive and
[1:44:42] well and I feel him moving I feel him
[1:44:45] breathing I feel him heal and I feel him
[1:44:47] saving
[1:44:51] not a god of History he's a
[1:44:53] presidentiality
[1:44:57] I think we ought to shouted in the back

[1:48:53] Messiah is here
[1:49:02] Messiah is here

[1:49:05] you say brother Andrew
[1:49:07] what are you saying I'm saying
[1:49:09] it's the greatest message of all time
[1:49:13] I propose to you that this message will
[1:49:17] deliver you
[1:49:18] from whatever you're under
[1:49:26] now we might as well preach
[1:49:29] education won't do it
[1:49:32] psychology won't do it
[1:49:34] a change of the way you think won't do
[1:49:36] it
[1:49:37] but a good old burning bush experience
[1:49:47] now
[1:49:49] foreign
[1:49:56] of a Vindicated Prophet has declared
[1:49:59] he's here now if you look with me in the
[1:50:01] message for a minute you'll see that in
[1:50:03] 1961 Bob comes and preaches a sermon
[1:50:05] called Daniel 70 weeks
[1:50:08] in those sermons he'll say it like this
[1:50:10] he says the first part I want to preach
[1:50:12] to you on is Gabriel's instructions to
[1:50:14] Daniel
[1:50:15] he said then the next thing is I want to
[1:50:17] speak to him the six-fold purpose of
[1:50:18] Gable's visit to Daniel
[1:50:20] he said then I want to I want to climax
[1:50:22] it with the 70th week of Daniel now when
[1:50:24] he opens just if I can take some Liberty
[1:50:26] here and lay this in here when he opens
[1:50:28] this he says now we're speaking on
[1:50:30] Daniel in captivity and Gabriel flying
[1:50:33] in to instruct him about the future
[1:50:35] while Daniel was in prayer Gabriel the
[1:50:38] Angels come in to instruct him he said
[1:50:42] like this he said I've been visiting
[1:50:43] around and he said the other day he said
[1:50:45] I've been to the libraries in Kentucky I
[1:50:48] read the ancient books I've done all I
[1:50:49] can do he said but I'm trusting solemnly
[1:50:52] in Jesus Christ to reveal it to me
[1:50:55] he says I don't want it to say I know
[1:50:59] this and I know that he said he knows my
[1:51:01] heart he's listening to me but I want it
[1:51:03] that I might Enlighten his people
[1:51:05] therefore I believe he will give it to
[1:51:07] me so he was asking for the Revelation
[1:51:10] to Enlighten the people now he said my
[1:51:13] wife said the other day how do you
[1:51:14] expect our people which are poor people
[1:51:16] many of them uneducated like we are to
[1:51:18] understand such as that I said God will
[1:51:21] give the answer no matter how
[1:51:23] complicated it is God can break it down
[1:51:26] and make it simple for we are the
[1:51:28] portion of those people who are longing
[1:51:31] and praying for that day in that hour
[1:51:32] and our eyes are set towards heaven and
[1:51:35] we're watching for his coming see we are
[1:51:38] watching for his coming now it's a it's
[1:51:40] astounding brother says it like this he
[1:51:42] says Daniel was about 12 or 14 years old
[1:51:45] when he went into captivity how many how
[1:51:47] many 12 year old what's that what's the
[1:51:49] age limit on this camp
[1:51:50] 12 how many 12 year olds have we got
[1:51:52] here we got 12 year 12 year old raise
[1:51:55] your hand real high 12 years old okay
[1:51:57] how many 14 year olds have we got here
[1:52:00] okay the age that you 12 and 14 year
[1:52:03] olds are is about the age program said
[1:52:06] Daniel was as a young man when he went
[1:52:08] into captivity but Daniel purposed in
[1:52:11] his heart that he would not defile
[1:52:13] himself with the portion of a king's
[1:52:16] meat nor with the wine which he drank
[1:52:18] therefore he requested of the prince of
[1:52:20] the eunuchs that he might not defile
[1:52:22] himself Brotherhood said Daniel was a
[1:52:24] prophet he said now the words of God the
[1:52:27] Bible was invested to Daniel
[1:52:29] brother the words of God the Bible was
[1:52:33] invested to Daniel he said to manifest
[1:52:36] to the people that God still lived
[1:52:41] testing well it's still working the
[1:52:44] words of God from the Bible was invested
[1:52:47] into Daniel to prove to the people that
[1:52:50] God still lived and Daniel purposed in
[1:52:53] his heart that he would not defile his
[1:52:56] investment see now if you start studying
[1:52:58] Daniel's day you will find that Daniel's
[1:53:01] day parallels our day it was a day of
[1:53:04] confusion because Daniel was in Babylon
[1:53:07] and Babylon means confusion so both
[1:53:09] Daniel's day and your day is a day of
[1:53:12] confusion
[1:53:13] now the prophet said what would you give
[1:53:15] in exchange in this day of confusion
[1:53:17] this day when people don't know what to
[1:53:18] do which a way to go but the Bible said
[1:53:21] these days would come there would be a
[1:53:23] famine in the land or for bread nor
[1:53:24] water but for hearing the true word of
[1:53:26] God and the people would go from east to
[1:53:29] west from north to south seeking to hear
[1:53:31] the true word of God and here we are
[1:53:33] privileged tonight to see the message of
[1:53:37] God the angel of God
[1:53:39] they are they are running to and fro
[1:53:42] trying to find what you're in the
[1:53:43] presence of
[1:53:49] come on Church they're spending millions
[1:53:51] of dollars of programs
[1:53:54] to try to entertain young people and
[1:53:56] it's not going to help
[1:53:58] because the wicked are they going to
[1:54:00] come more wicked the church is going to
[1:54:02] come more churchy but the prophet said
[1:54:04] the saints of God will come closer to
[1:54:07] God
[1:54:09] then the way you come closer to God is
[1:54:13] through the revelation of his word we
[1:54:15] are living in a day of confusion now I
[1:54:18] love this because when God brings an end
[1:54:20] to things he forewarns when an end if
[1:54:24] something is coming he forewarns you the
[1:54:27] end is at hand he does not allow you to
[1:54:29] abruptly hit the end and then say oh man
[1:54:32] I forgot to tell you amen we're at the
[1:54:34] end but he sins amen different ways for
[1:54:38] you as a Believer to Mark the time of
[1:54:41] the age you're living in you know what
[1:54:42] he sins he sends angels come on in the
[1:54:45] days of Lord he sent angels to Abraham
[1:54:48] he said Angels Amen in the days of Noah
[1:54:50] he sent Revelation amen he sends
[1:54:53] Messengers amen but here's what I want
[1:54:54] to show you in the days of Daniel he did
[1:54:57] it by books
[1:55:01] in the days of Daniel he warned a 12 and
[1:55:04] a four or a 14 year old boy Daniel the
[1:55:07] end of all things is at hand and he
[1:55:09] didn't do it by just an angel he didn't
[1:55:12] just do it by messenger but he did it by
[1:55:14] a book now can you give me Daniel 9 and
[1:55:17] verse 1.
[1:55:19] y'all ain't gonna sleep on me yet have
[1:55:21] you well let's preach in the first year
[1:55:24] of Darius the son of a source of the
[1:55:25] seed of the medes which was the king
[1:55:27] over the realm of Chaldeans in the first
[1:55:29] year of his Reign I Daniel was confused
[1:55:32] by the books in the number of the years
[1:55:34] where of the word the Lord came to
[1:55:36] Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[1:55:38] accomplish 70 years in the desolations
[1:55:40] of Jerusalem
[1:55:41] is that what's your Bible reads I Daniel
[1:55:44] was too young to understand by the books
[1:55:47] the number of the years where the word
[1:55:48] of the Lord came
[1:55:50] say what's your Bible
[1:55:53] I Daniel realized it's too deep for me
[1:55:55] to understand my books the number
[1:55:58] but my Bible says I Daniel understood by
[1:56:02] the books
[1:56:04] I understood by the books the number of
[1:56:08] the years wherever the Lord came to
[1:56:09] Jeremiah the prophet that he would
[1:56:11] accomplish 70 years in Jerusalem and the
[1:56:15] desolation of Jerusalem you know what
[1:56:17] that word understand means it means
[1:56:19] discern it means to mark it means to
[1:56:22] realize brother brother Andrew can I
[1:56:24] borrow it from this morning you're the
[1:56:25] most Discerning body of people on the
[1:56:28] face of the Earth
[1:56:29] come on Church you're the most
[1:56:31] Discerning people by the word now listen
[1:56:34] and I set my face unto the Lord God to
[1:56:37] seek my prayer and supplication with
[1:56:38] fasting and sackcloth and Ashes So
[1:56:41] Daniel knew that time by the books and
[1:56:44] as he read the books he didn't lay him
[1:56:46] aside but he was moved into desperation
[1:56:48] by the books he was reading now I want
[1:56:50] to I want to break this down for you if
[1:56:52] that's okay I Daniel want you to know
[1:56:55] this remember I said I want you to
[1:56:56] notice how Daniel yet an alien yet
[1:56:58] ousted from his people
[1:56:59] ousted from his church without a church
[1:57:01] without any church to go to without any
[1:57:04] hymns to be saying but what he's saying
[1:57:06] itself in the midst of all of this
[1:57:08] Thomas he still held on to what the
[1:57:11] prophet said
[1:57:13] laughs
[1:57:17] testing you mean to tell me you got
[1:57:20] probably 10 youth camps a year you got
[1:57:22] free services a week you gotta oh God
[1:57:26] you've got 1100 books and Page you've
[1:57:29] got preachers and Pastors in advance us
[1:57:31] come on you got youth leaders you got
[1:57:33] used meetings you got prayer groups you
[1:57:35] got youth nights you got you chats youth
[1:57:38] friends come on
[1:57:39] and some of you can't make it from one
[1:57:42] Camp to another I say it's time to end
[1:57:44] that cycle I say it's time to break that
[1:57:46] cycle I say it's time if a 12 or a 14
[1:57:50] year old boy can live in a Babylonian
[1:57:52] captivity under the rule and the reign
[1:57:55] of heathens and still hold on to what a
[1:57:57] prophet said regardless of his friends
[1:57:59] regardless of the atmosphere I think
[1:58:02] it's time this bride ought to reach
[1:58:04] beyond the feelings
[1:58:05] [Applause]
[1:58:11] thank you
[1:58:13] [Applause]
[1:58:16] I Daniel understood
[1:58:19] by the books now it may get tied here so
[1:58:22] put your seat belt on but we'll get
[1:58:23] through it if Daniel the Prophet of the
[1:58:25] Lord could consult Jeremiah's books and
[1:58:29] bring him to such a place even Israel
[1:58:31] coming out all of them alive was coming
[1:58:34] out of Babylon to go back to the
[1:58:36] Homeland what caused him to fast with
[1:58:38] sackcoff and Ashes how much more on it
[1:58:41] to do the church Living God to know that
[1:58:43] time is fading out and shall be no more
[1:58:45] and the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:58:48] and the great Millennium is ready to set
[1:58:50] in now unexpected turbulence okay how
[1:58:54] can we spend wasteless time gambling
[1:58:57] foreign
[1:58:59] holes on Sunday no time for the Lord
[1:59:02] just run down and if the pastor speaks
[1:59:04] something or another you don't like it
[1:59:06] get up and go out if the church holds
[1:59:08] too long well you're dissatisfied amen
[1:59:11] look at our condition look what we're
[1:59:13] doing and compare our lives with the
[1:59:16] prophet one man in a complete Kingdom
[1:59:18] with no church to go to it was torn down
[1:59:21] burned down his City his people was kept
[1:59:24] in 68 years he had two years left and he
[1:59:27] was still holding on to the words of the
[1:59:30] prophet
[1:59:36] all right
[1:59:38] swimming holes on Sunday
[1:59:41] well we're here we might as well preach
[1:59:43] whatever happened to being loyal to the
[1:59:45] house of God
[1:59:50] well brother Andrew they're just
[1:59:52] teenagers well teenagers grow up to be
[1:59:54] husbands and mothers and fathers
[1:59:58] come on Church get married don't change
[2:00:01] it it just gives you more opportunity to
[2:00:03] do what you always done if you always
[2:00:05] miss church now you got two people
[2:00:06] missing church if you always had a
[2:00:09] television in your home now you got four
[2:00:11] eyes watching that television
[2:00:13] well it feels good to preach in the
[2:00:15] house of God what's wrong with us I'll
[2:00:17] tell you what's wrong is we've let
[2:00:19] laodicea amen reduce our limits and
[2:00:22] reduce our faith down for well we're
[2:00:24] just a bunch of ill relevant people
[2:00:25] they've been reading out of old books
[2:00:27] and old tapes and following some man
[2:00:29] that was dead years ago that's a lie
[2:00:31] from the pits of hell you are a Rapture

[2:04:44] now
[2:04:45] before Daniel goes into captivity can I
[2:04:48] have a few more minutes
[2:04:49] foreign
[2:04:50] Daniel goes into captivity the Bible
[2:04:53] says in Jeremiah the 25th chapter said
[2:04:56] let's turn over and read what Jeremiah
[2:04:58] had to say Jeremiah 25 8 therefore thus
[2:05:01] saith Lord of hosts because you've not
[2:05:03] heard my words Behold I will send and
[2:05:05] take all the families of the north saith
[2:05:07] the Lord and Nebuchadnezzar the king of
[2:05:09] Babylon and my servant and will bring
[2:05:10] them against this land and against the
[2:05:12] inhabitants thereof and against all
[2:05:14] these nations round about and will
[2:05:16] utterly destroy them and make them
[2:05:18] astonishment in his hissing and
[2:05:20] Perpetual desolation moreover I will
[2:05:22] take from them the voice of Mirth and
[2:05:24] the voice of gladness and the voice of
[2:05:25] the Mad groom and the voice of the bride
[2:05:27] and they'll send the milestones and the
[2:05:29] light of the candle and this whole land
[2:05:31] shall be a desolation and an
[2:05:33] astonishment and these nations Shall
[2:05:35] Serve the king of Babylon 70 years
[2:05:37] Daniel at 12 or 14 year old boy read
[2:05:41] Jeremiah's message and it shall come to
[2:05:43] pass when 70 years are accomplished then
[2:05:46] I will punish the king of Babylon and
[2:05:48] that Nation saith the Lord for their
[2:05:51] will make it Perpetual desolation and I
[2:05:54] will bring up that land I will bring
[2:05:56] upon that land oh my
[2:05:59] foreign
[2:06:00] I will bring up on that land all my
[2:06:03] words which I pronounced against it even
[2:06:06] all that is written in this book which
[2:06:09] Jeremiah has prophesied against all the
[2:06:12] nations for Many Nations and great Kings
[2:06:13] Shall Serve them also and I will
[2:06:16] recompense them according their deeds
[2:06:17] and according to works of their own
[2:06:18] hands so brother baby said like this he
[2:06:20] said when God sent Jeremiah was a true
[2:06:23] message he said there's always a false
[2:06:25] prophet to arise on the scene to take
[2:06:28] the attention off of the truth and put
[2:06:30] it on the false he said but look when
[2:06:32] Gabriel appeared to reveal not only what
[2:06:33] he was talking about but to tell him all
[2:06:36] the way down what was determined for the
[2:06:38] Jewish race all the way to the
[2:06:41] consummation
[2:06:44] God help me
[2:06:46] Daniel was not reading about a partial
[2:06:49] future
[2:06:50] when he read the words of Jeremiah he
[2:06:53] was reading about it all the way to the
[2:06:55] consummation
[2:06:57] he was reading about the Captivity he
[2:07:00] was reading about the means of Persians
[2:07:02] he was reading about everything up to
[2:07:03] the consummation and notice this all the
[2:07:06] way the consummation listen he asked a
[2:07:09] little bit and got the whole thing

[2:10:57] come scoffers in the last days I
[2:10:59] understand they'll be Nation against

[2:12:33] you know what I think it's time to do I
[2:12:35] think it's time to lose the shame of
[2:12:37] these books
[2:12:45] I think it's time to lose the shame of
[2:12:48] quoting the prophet of God
[2:12:52] if Daniel could overcome and escape the
[2:12:55] desolation of Jerusalem by the books of
[2:12:58] the words of Jeremiah I think it's time
[2:13:00] young people we ought to quit worrying
[2:13:02] about well if I tell somebody what I
[2:13:04] believe well they may think I'm a little
[2:13:05] crazy listen they're gonna think you're
[2:13:07] crazy either way so you might as well go
[2:13:10] ahead and give them a chance to escape
[2:13:12] the Desolation and it's coming Upon This
[2:13:15] Nation
[2:13:17] but Andrew what are you saying you've
[2:13:19] been ordained to a message young man
[2:13:21] you've been ordained to a message hang
[2:13:23] ladies
[2:13:27] get beneath it
[2:13:30] now
[2:13:32] Andrew what are you saying I'm saying
[2:13:35] Daniel
[2:13:37] had Jeremiah's prophecy
[2:13:40] living
[2:13:41] on the inside of him
[2:13:43] Daniel
[2:13:44] was ordained
[2:13:46] to a message
[2:13:50] the message and I'm gonna I'm gonna
[2:13:53] drive this home I got five minutes
[2:13:57] the message
[2:13:59] needs your flesh
[2:14:03] don't need your talent
[2:14:09] don't need your abilities
[2:14:11] it needs your flesh
[2:14:13] now
[2:14:15] well Andrew what are you saying I'm
[2:14:16] saying that through human
[2:14:17] instrumentality
[2:14:19] a believer
[2:14:20] comes in contact with his maker
[2:14:22] so we get so soured down with theology
[2:14:24] so we don't know nothing about the
[2:14:26] spirit
[2:14:27] he said I hope you love me after this
[2:14:28] but that's what it is I mean Pentecost
[2:14:29] 2. that's right he said just shouting
[2:14:32] and dancing around doesn't mean you know
[2:14:33] anything about the spirit
[2:14:34] it's personal contact
[2:14:37] it's face to face that's what you need
[2:14:40] that's the kind of church God's fixing
[2:14:43] to raise up
[2:14:45] [Music]
[2:14:48] young people if that Revelation strikes
[2:14:50] your heart limb you'll you'll outrun the
[2:14:51] horses of Elijah
[2:14:55] you're a generation that has come face
[2:14:57] to face with personal contact with God
[2:15:02] now without a prophet there's no way to
[2:15:04] come face to face
[2:15:06] but if you come face to face he says now
[2:15:09] the word come the prophet and now now
[2:15:11] can I can I dramatize this to you John
[2:15:13] has got to introduce Jesus right
[2:15:16] Jesus has got to be baptized of John so
[2:15:20] John is in the river of Jordan baptizing
[2:15:22] people and here comes the Lord walking
[2:15:26] to him and says I have need to be
[2:15:29] baptized of you
[2:15:31] and John says me
[2:15:34] me
[2:15:36] no no Lord no no no no Lord you don't
[2:15:39] understand see I'm just a young person
[2:15:43] see no Lord you don't understand do you
[2:15:45] realize the family that that I come out
[2:15:47] of
[2:15:48] Lord you you better go find somebody
[2:15:51] else to do this because you don't
[2:15:52] realize you you're talking to the Gracie
[2:15:54] guy that comes in out of the Wilderness
[2:15:56] and
[2:15:57] had a bath in six months
[2:16:01] I hope pray them dorms can't testify to
[2:16:03] that
[2:16:06] Lord you you don't understand Lord
[2:16:09] I'm the I'm the I'm the I'm the wrong
[2:16:11] one boy you better go find somebody
[2:16:13] better than me to believe this message
[2:16:16] but John I ordained you
[2:16:20] when you were born on the Earth you were
[2:16:22] born for a specific purpose and your
[2:16:25] purpose was to forerun the coming word
[2:16:27] your purpose was oh God hear me your
[2:16:31] purpose was to wash the sacrifice before
[2:16:34] it is presented
[2:16:36] John do you know who you are you are in
[2:16:39] the word program said Oh my he said the
[2:16:42] word come to the prophet in the
[2:16:44] dispensation of Grace
[2:16:49] the word stood face to face with John in
[2:16:53] the dispensation of Grace
[2:16:55] and said I have need
[2:16:57] of you to baptize me
[2:17:00] lord I can't do it but John you was
[2:17:02] ordained
[2:17:04] Lord I'm enabled but John
[2:17:08] he was ordained
[2:17:10] no Lord listen to me listen Lord you
[2:17:13] don't understand listen my family
[2:17:16] my situations
[2:17:18] but you was ordained
[2:17:22] are you hearing me young people
[2:17:25] it's dispensation of Grace
[2:17:30] and can I tell you what the prophet of
[2:17:31] God said he said it like this he said
[2:17:33] it's like a man the other day that got
[2:17:34] in trouble and was going up for the
[2:17:35] firing squad
[2:17:36] and he said the friend ran out and found
[2:17:39] Abraham Lincoln
[2:17:40] and said Abraham Mr President call him
[2:17:43] Abraham remember said President Lincoln
[2:17:47] right approach
[2:17:50] he said my friends getting ready to be
[2:17:51] killed in the morning by firing squad
[2:17:54] would you sign a pardon said he reached
[2:17:57] over in his briefcase
[2:17:59] grabbed a piece of paper and wrote out I
[2:18:01] Abraham Lincoln president of the United
[2:18:03] States pardon this man so and so he said
[2:18:06] here take it to him
[2:18:08] take it to him
[2:18:10] and remember him said that man took off
[2:18:12] running to the prison

[2:18:15] and said listen

[2:18:27] way here you're saying all these great
[2:18:29] things about a message and a third pool
[2:18:30] and a resurrected Messiah living in me

[2:18:34] brother Andrew you don't realize who
[2:18:36] you're talking to you're talking to a
[2:18:38] kid that's been abused

[2:18:42] you're talking to a kid that's come out
[2:18:44] of a broken situation don't humiliate me
[2:18:46] with something like that there's no way
[2:18:49] that that can do it for me
[2:18:53] there's no way that that message you're
[2:18:55] preaching about can change my future
[2:18:58] well I say this it can change anybody's
[2:19:00] future
[2:19:05] it can change your future

[2:19:16] I went before God today and I studied
[2:19:19] the words of the seventh angel and he
[2:19:21] sent me here tonight to tell you this
[2:19:23] receive your pardon

[2:19:37] situation but I understand by books that
[2:19:40] there'll be a branch that will arise out
[2:19:42] of this Sodom age
[2:19:44] and he said don't don't don't humiliate
[2:19:47] me with that just just go on
[2:19:49] he said but no listen to me it's a
[2:19:52] pardon he said if it was a real pardon
[2:19:55] it would have an official seal and it
[2:19:58] wouldn't look like that
[2:20:00] it wouldn't be in 1100 books and tapes
[2:20:02] with improper English
[2:20:06] and Hanks and tanks and tanks and
[2:20:11] but listen to me if you can accept it
[2:20:14] son you can go free

[2:26:45] prophetic utterance he said and when you
[2:26:47] hear the prophetic utterance he said
[2:26:49] don't do nothing but make preparation
[2:26:53] like this he said if the spirit of
[2:26:55] Prophecy speaks to you he said that's
[2:26:57] got to be judged by two or three
[2:26:58] Witnesses before it can be presented to
