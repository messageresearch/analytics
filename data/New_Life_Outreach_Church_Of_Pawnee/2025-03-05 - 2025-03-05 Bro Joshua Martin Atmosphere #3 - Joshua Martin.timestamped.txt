[38:49] and and his wife in in prayer I know the
[38:51] Lord sees everything we go through amen
[38:54] but Luke 2 2 and
[38:56] 25 and the Bible would say behold there
[38:58] was a man in
[39:00] Jerusalem who who whose name was Simeon
[39:03] and the the same man was just and devout
[39:06] waiting on the for the constellation of
[39:08] Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him
[39:11] and it was revealed unto him by the holy
[39:13] ghost that he should not see death
[39:15] before he had seen the Lord's Christ and
[39:18] he came by the spirit into the temple
[39:20] and when the parents brought in the
[39:22] Child Jesus to do for him after the
[39:24] custom of the law then took him up in
[39:26] his arms and blessed God and said Lord
[39:29] now let us thy servant depart in peace
[39:31] according to Thy word for mine eyes have
[39:34] seen thy salvation amen can we pray here

[39:54] weary in body father but Lord we have an

[40:17] tonight and uh it is good to see brother
[40:20] Joe and sister Stephany here we've been
[40:22] praying for sister Stephanie thankful
[40:24] for what the Lord is is doing for her
[40:26] bringing her through the surgery and
[40:27] everything also good to see Patrick back
[40:30] there it's been a little while so it's
[40:32] good to see him thankful that he's with
[40:35] us also brother Chris that is that has
[40:37] been with us the last few Services it's
[40:39] also been good to good to have him just
[40:42] pray he feels at home and and welcome
[40:44] here but I'm just going to continue on
[40:46] my thought on atmosphere and brother
[40:48] Brandon he would use this scripture many
[40:51] times as he would preach
[40:53] expectations uh uh being led of the
[40:55] spirit he uses it many times and he
[40:58] would say I'm going to use the subject
[41:00] expectation expectations is usually
[41:03] based upon a faith you have to have
[41:05] faith before you can expect anything and
[41:08] now like many other Servants of God in
[41:10] the Old Testament Faith cometh by
[41:12] hearing and hearing the word of God and
[41:15] I've often quoted this that God is
[41:17] obligated to his word and I and I like
[41:20] to read just a word or two of it because
[41:22] what I say will fail because I'm a man
[41:25] but what but his word cannot fail
[41:27] because it's God and God has has ever
[41:30] called on the scene at any time to make
[41:32] a decision the first decision God has
[41:35] ever made has to be the same decision
[41:38] every time now there that's where we
[41:40] must solemnly base our faith on thus
[41:42] sayth the Lord You Must Believe it that
[41:45] it is God's word and that's the only
[41:48] hope that we have the only uh uh only
[41:50] hope that we have is on the word of God
[41:53] and now God being infinite cannot make a
[41:55] mistake he's perfect therefore and all
[41:58] of his promises must be perfect as he is
[42:02] perfect and so our expectations is is
[42:04] based upon our faith in the word of God
[42:07] and and I like how brother Brandon was
[42:09] puing it you can't have faith before you
[42:12] you have to have faith before you can
[42:14] expect anything and brother Brandon he
[42:16] would say in expectations he says why
[42:18] are you here for your healing because
[42:21] God had promised that he would do it so
[42:23] before you can enter in and and expect
[42:26] the super natural it always goes back to
[42:28] a promise and and the promise is a a
[42:32] revelation that God is doing it for me
[42:34] that that God promised me a healing God
[42:37] has promised me a a renewing God has
[42:39] promised me a deliverance and for the
[42:41] brand I'm going to talk about Abraham
[42:43] and how God would speak to Abraham and
[42:45] would reveal to him that he was going to
[42:48] have a baby by Sarah and he says that
[42:50] his expectations was not what in the
[42:52] doctor said but what in the promise said
[42:55] then he would bring it down to us and he
[42:57] would say when you take God at his word
[42:59] we have to separate our things from
[43:02] everything that is contrary to that word
[43:05] and then he would say and and I think
[43:06] this is pretty pretty incredible he says
[43:08] you can't go to people and say how do
[43:10] you think about it do you think I can
[43:12] get my healing do you do you think I I
[43:15] can get something from God he says it's
[43:17] not what do they think it's what do you
[43:20] think it's up to you and he goes back to
[43:22] Abraham and says he did so with the
[43:24] Great Expectations of receiving the
[43:27] child so it ain't going to uh to Mama or
[43:30] to Daddy or or to the the neighbor or
[43:32] whatever and saying can God do it for me
[43:35] he says it ain't up to them it's up to
[43:37] you can you believe that God can do it
[43:40] for you can can your expectations line
[43:42] up with the word of God that God can
[43:45] meet the promise that he gave me and
[43:47] that's where we we base our faith is
[43:49] upon th sayth oh Lord not on not on uh
[43:53] man's word or man's ability but it's on
[43:56] the infinite word of God because he
[43:58] cannot make any mistakes and brother
[44:00] Brandon would say there was a question
[44:02] here excuse me here in the scripture and
[44:05] this morning I left off speaking on the
[44:08] word of expectation and to expect and
[44:11] now I trust that you took it home with
[44:13] you and search through the scriptures to
[44:15] find out what to expect and God's word
[44:18] tells us what we can expect and if we
[44:21] receive this word without any doubt
[44:23] mixed into it we will receive what we
[44:26] come for ain't that powerful God's word
[44:29] tells us what we can expect so whatever
[44:32] the word tells us we can expect God to
[44:35] meet that promise you know and brother
[44:37] brandham says and if we receive this
[44:39] word without any doubt so if we look at
[44:42] the word and get an expectation and not
[44:45] add any of our doubt to it just keep it
[44:48] to God's word then we can get what we
[44:51] expect and the Bible would tell us we
[44:53] look at not things that are seen but
[44:55] things that are not that are not seen
[44:57] for the things which are seen are
[44:59] temporal but the things which are not
[45:01] seen are Eternal that's what I want I I
[45:03] don't want Corporal things and and fancy
[45:06] things on the earth I want the spiritual
[45:08] blessings of God like I would like we
[45:10] was preaching on Sunday we don't want
[45:12] just the blessings of God we want the
[45:14] spiritual blessings of God and we're
[45:16] thankful for a a nice building we're
[45:18] thankful for electricity we're we're
[45:20] thankful that we got running water here
[45:22] but I want the spiritual blessings of
[45:24] God whatever he promised in the word of
[45:26] God but he didn't promise that we would
[45:28] have electricity he didn't promise that
[45:30] we would have a nice warm building that
[45:32] we can come into but he did promise
[45:35] where two or three are gathered in my
[45:37] name I will be in your midst so we're
[45:40] not expecting the blessings of God
[45:42] because many times we get discouraged
[45:44] when we don't see blessings of God we
[45:47] where we don't maybe not have the money
[45:48] to meet the bills and we get discouraged
[45:51] because we don't see the blessings of
[45:52] God but if the spiritual blessings of
[45:55] God are there that's where our
[45:57] expectation is at you know I want to see
[45:59] the B the spiritual blessings of God and
[46:02] and the Bible would tell us that our
[46:04] faith it's our faith that pleases God so
[46:07] I believe before we can we can ever ask
[46:09] anything of God our faith has to produce
[46:12] an expectation that when I do ask God
[46:16] he's going to meet it you see we're not
[46:18] just coming to and at prayer meetings
[46:20] and and coming to church and to saying
[46:22] God I hope you do something and in the
[46:24] back of our mind knowing he's not going
[46:26] to do it but but because we believe he
[46:28] can do it our expectation is when I come
[46:31] to a prayer meeting I know God is going
[46:33] to meet my need when when I come to a
[46:35] Wednesday night service I know God is
[46:38] going to meet my need if if I'm needing
[46:40] to be encouraged I've got an expectation
[46:43] from the word of God that he promised me
[46:46] if I get in the right atmosphere he will
[46:49] fulfill his word and we know that we we
[46:52] get our faith by the word of God and
[46:55] brother Brandon would tell us that the
[46:56] the word of God was given to his church
[46:59] to defeat the world and the Devils the
[47:01] sicknesses and to cast out Devils no con
[47:04] no denomination was given to the church
[47:07] the the word was given to the church
[47:10] that is her strength and what is the
[47:12] denomination a a type of a type of law
[47:15] type of Works a program something you
[47:18] can do to work your way to heaven but
[47:20] that's not what God gave us to earn the
[47:23] favor of God he gave us his word and our
[47:26] faith in the word puts us in a position
[47:29] that the favor of God can rest upon New
[47:32] Life Outreach that the favor of God can
[47:35] rest on our marriages and the favor of
[47:37] God can rest on our young people and
[47:39] things so we're not trying to earn the
[47:42] favor of God because we'll never earn
[47:44] the favor of God we'll never be good
[47:46] enough for the the spiritual blessings
[47:48] of God but it comes back to our faith
[47:51] that's what puts us in a position to see
[47:54] the Miracles of God and you remember
[47:56] them the the man in the Bible that had a
[47:58] son that was possessed by a devil and
[48:01] and and it's a it's a sad situation cuz
[48:04] the Bible would tell us that the this
[48:06] boy had a spirit upon him and the spirit
[48:08] would throw him into the fire throw him
[48:10] into the water and and it's incredible
[48:13] what this what this father would say he
[48:15] would say if you can only have
[48:17] compassion on us and help us and then
[48:20] Jesus would look at him and would say if
[48:22] you can't believe all things are
[48:24] possible if you can only believe look at
[48:27] the sincerity of this man he will look
[48:29] at him and say I do believe but help my
[48:32] unbelief you see whenever he looked at
[48:34] Jesus and it would say just have
[48:36] compassion on me Jesus going to look at
[48:39] him and say well if you can just do this
[48:41] if you can just do that if you can live
[48:43] a good life if you can do that then I
[48:45] will have compassion on you he looked at
[48:47] him and said if you can only believe not
[48:50] the works that you can do not good not
[48:52] not how how loud you can shout not not
[48:54] how loud you can sing but if you can
[48:57] have faith in what I can do then the
[49:00] power can be released to you and what I
[49:02] love about it is is brother Brandon
[49:04] would tell us that that the compassion
[49:06] of God is Not Human sympathy right you
[49:09] remember whenever Jesus would go to the
[49:11] man had the pull up Bethesda G brother
[49:14] Brandon would say you would think that
[49:16] Jesus a man of compassion would have
[49:18] stopped for everybody else too and would
[49:21] heal their diseases and brother brandham
[49:23] says many people mistake compassion for
[49:26] human sympathy syy he says compassion is
[49:29] not human sympathy it's the will of the
[49:31] father and so here this man would look
[49:34] the Jesus and would say give me some
[49:36] sympathy you know just feel sorry for me
[49:39] and Jesus wasn't looking at him and
[49:41] feeling sorry for him he knew that the
[49:44] will of the father was for that boy to
[49:47] be set free and I don't believe God is
[49:49] looking at us with sympathy and saying
[49:52] oh man I hope they can make it I hope
[49:53] they're good enough I hope they can
[49:55] overcome on their life I hope they're
[49:57] going to make a Rapture he has not given
[49:59] us sympathy he has given us the word of
[50:02] God to perform the will of God oh
[50:05] Hallelujah God is now looking and saying
[50:08] I hope you can be good enough he says I
[50:10] know you can be good enough if you can
[50:12] only believe the word that I have given
[50:15] you and expect for big things expect for
[50:18] the Rapture expect the body change you
[50:21] see it was Jesus looking at that man and
[50:23] saying if you can only believe and I
[50:26] believe it's only through our faith do
[50:28] we gain the favor of God and brother
[50:30] brandom or Peter would tell us in Acts
[50:33] 10:44 while Peter spake these words the
[50:36] Holy Ghost fell on them when which heard
[50:40] the word and so while Peter was
[50:41] preaching the Holy Ghost would fall on
[50:44] them which heard the word so they had
[50:47] nothing to do with it they was just
[50:49] sitting there and as the word would come
[50:51] forth they would receive that word then
[50:54] that would bring the Fulfillment of
[50:56] prophet phy that would bring the
[50:58] Fulfillment that in the last days I will
[51:00] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh there
[51:02] were setting in a position and when the
[51:05] strength would come over them they would
[51:07] grab that strength and bring prophecy
[51:10] out of the Old Testament into reality
[51:14] and I believe that the strength of the
[51:15] church is still the word of God and
[51:18] every time the strength comes across
[51:20] your situation you're reaching out and
[51:23] pulling it out of the Bible pulling it
[51:25] out of the 60s pulling it out of the 50s
[51:27] into a reality and see I can be the
[51:30] Fulfillment of the promise that God has
[51:33] given us oh Hallelujah CU I want to be
[51:36] the Fulfillment you know I I don't want
[51:38] to just come to church and and you know
[51:40] put on a nice suit and C my hair and and
[51:42] do these things and never have the favor
[51:44] of God I want the favor of God in every
[51:47] aspect of my life in in my prayer life I
[51:50] want the favor of God when I study I
[51:52] want the favor of God when I worship I
[51:55] want the favor of God I don't want
[51:57] motions I don't want Traditions I want
[51:59] the favor of God to come with my
[52:02] expectation and see the promises of God
[52:05] fulfilled in every one of our lives and
[52:08] you see brother Brandon would say
[52:09] everybody in the atmosphere that Jesus
[52:12] Christ is there and going to meet
[52:15] everything that they have need of
[52:17] something will go to taking place he
[52:20] says atmosphere but that's the hardest
[52:22] thing to do is to get the people in that
[52:25] atmosphere the atmosphere of worship the
[52:28] atmosphere of believing how come that's
[52:31] the hardest thing to do because once you
[52:34] get in the atmosphere of believing
[52:36] expectations start to build once you get
[52:38] in that atmosphere of believing
[52:41] expectations is no longer a hope so it's
[52:44] a no so it's no longer I'm hoping God is
[52:46] going to meet us at Youth Camp it's a no
[52:48] so that if I can just get in the
[52:50] presence of God my expectation is going
[52:54] to pull my blessing to reality ity and
[52:57] brother Brandon would talk about Simeon
[52:59] and would say that it was promised by
[53:01] the holy ghost that Simeon was going to
[53:04] see the Lord before he had died and and
[53:07] it's so incredible how brother Brandon
[53:08] would put it he says God had a reason to
[53:11] reveal it and then Simeon had a right to
[53:15] expect it ain't that powerful once it
[53:18] was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost
[53:21] then he had a right to expect it you see
[53:25] it ain't the compassion of God to pour
[53:27] our blessings upon us it's all right to
[53:30] get the spiritual blessings of God cuz
[53:33] he promised it to me you see it ain't
[53:35] the sympathy of God saying okay I guess
[53:38] I'm going to let your children be on
[53:39] fire with the Holy Ghost no he promised
[53:42] it to me and I've got a right to expect
[53:45] it I've got a right to see the Holy
[53:47] Ghost fall upon my children I've got a
[53:49] right to expect the Holy Ghost to walk
[53:52] through the pews and down the AIS I've
[53:54] got a right to do it because God has
[53:57] promised me that it can be that way oh
[54:00] Hallelujah brother Brandon would tell us
[54:02] and than that the Holy Spirit can lead
[54:04] man and tell him things and make him act
[54:07] different and make him believe things
[54:10] and receive things that the world could
[54:12] never believe could happen I'm a witness
[54:15] I once was blind myself and he says
[54:18] practically how to be led so I know what
[54:20] I'm talking about that's the Holy Spirit
[54:23] and if you oh if you can just feel that
[54:26] Paul ation of the spirit begin to rise
[54:29] in your heart saying Jesus Christ is in
[54:32] our midst whether wherever two or three
[54:34] are gathered in my name I'll be in the
[54:36] midst he says pulsations something
[54:39] moving like a heartbeat it's pumping
[54:41] energy into your spirit pumping energy
[54:44] into your mind then let the things that
[54:47] your eyes see black out and then let the
[54:49] things that are of the world you're
[54:51] believing what God said he says once the
[54:54] Holy Spirit comes and starts to reveal
[54:57] to you and lead you then there's a
[55:00] pulsation that starts to be inside of
[55:02] your chest that the world knows nothing
[55:05] about then the things that you do see
[55:08] start to black out that all you see is
[55:11] the spiritual blessings of God oh come
[55:13] on now we're now looking at natural
[55:15] situations and saying I hope God can
[55:17] move I hope God can move but there's a
[55:20] pulation on the inside that is blacking
[55:23] out all of the natural circumstances and
[55:26] all I see is the promises of God that he
[55:29] promised that I can have oh my I say
[55:32] little church it's time to get in a
[55:34] pulsation of Faith where all we see we
[55:37] don't see troubles we don't see
[55:38] circumstances we don't see failures we
[55:40] don't see condemnation but all we see is
[55:43] the promises of God that he promised
[55:46] that I can have I'm not looking at
[55:48] mistakes I'm not looking at problems I'm
[55:51] looking at a promise that he gave me
[55:53] that I can see the Supernatural is is
[55:56] that's your expectation tonight if he
[55:58] promised me it I am expecting it
[56:01] Hallelujah I'm expecting it it's the
[56:04] Holy Spirit leading man and telling him
[56:06] things that he can have and the Bible
[56:09] would tell us that the sons of God are
[56:11] led by the spirit of God and you see
[56:13] brother Brandon would tell us that
[56:15] that's the whole of the Christian
[56:17] experience the Christian life is getting
[56:19] in the spirit and he says that's what
[56:21] would bring the Visions onto John was
[56:24] getting in the spirit John would say I
[56:27] was in the spirit on the Lord's day and
[56:29] I Heard a Voice say I am Alpha and Omega
[56:32] the beginning and the end so once he got
[56:35] into the spirit brother the Brandon
[56:37] would tell us that he got into the
[56:39] spirit and was transported into the
[56:42] Lord's day and then he heard that voice
[56:44] I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and
[56:47] the end so once uh once John was
[56:51] transported then he would have an
[56:53] expectation that he is the beginning and
[56:55] the end ending and I think that is so
[56:57] incredible that he did not just say the
[56:59] beginning and the ending but he said
[57:01] there's an end in between so the one
[57:04] that has started your journey is going
[57:06] to finish your journey but also in
[57:08] between in between the the the starting
[57:11] line and the Finish Line I am going to
[57:13] be there and you can expect me to be in
[57:17] every Avenue of your life you can expect
[57:19] me to be in the hard times you can
[57:22] expect me to be in the trials you can
[57:24] expect me when you hit rock
[57:26] you can expect me because in the spirit
[57:29] I told you this would happen oh
[57:33] hallelujah we're not making stuff up
[57:35] we're getting into the spirit and the
[57:38] Lord is revealing to me what he is to me
[57:41] oh my like like brother Brandon was
[57:43] saying we're not going to everybody else
[57:45] and saying can God do it for me we know
[57:47] God can do it and so when when John got
[57:50] into the spirit he didn't go to the
[57:52] other the other the prisoners and the
[57:54] inmates and saying what do you think do
[57:56] you think he's the beginning and the
[57:57] ending do you think he's the Alpha and
[58:00] the Omega he didn't care what they said
[58:02] the spirit told him that he was the
[58:05] Alpha and the Omega I don't care what
[58:07] you got to say the word told me where
[58:10] two or three are gathered in my name I
[58:13] would be in their midst and I am
[58:15] expecting on a Wednesday night service
[58:17] that the Holy Ghost can fall and walk
[58:20] the ows walk the pews renew with the
[58:23] Holy Ghost encourage the ones that are
[58:25] discouraged take take away condemnation
[58:27] come to a young person that is fighting
[58:29] peer pressure if you can expect it for
[58:32] you you can have
[58:34] it oh Hallelujah this ain't just a
[58:37] Gathering Place this is a place where
[58:40] Miracles can happen this ain't just a
[58:42] just a Tavern that we come to three
[58:44] times a week this is a place where the
[58:46] supernatural can fall and change lives I
[58:50] still believe that that there's still a
[58:52] holy ghost that can burn out sin that
[58:54] can burn out and bring a Deliverance
[58:57] like never before we're not just coming
[58:59] here out of a tradition there's an
[59:02] expectation on the inside of our life
[59:04] that I'm going to see God not a god of
[59:08] yesterday but I'm seeing a god of today
[59:11] I'm expecting it I'm going to receive it
[59:14] I'm going to see it the spirit told me I
[59:17] can have it oh Hallelujah the spirit
[59:20] told me I could have it oh man not a man
[59:25] but the spirit and brother Brandon would
[59:27] tell us he says talking about John he
[59:30] says his Spirit got on the prophet then
[59:32] he be to see things and he says you'll
[59:35] go to seeing things when you get in the
[59:38] spirit oh my when John got into the
[59:41] spirit he begin to see things that ain't
[59:43] just for a prophet but he says once you
[59:46] get into the spirit you'll start to see
[59:49] things and I don't believe we're going
[59:50] to imagine things but we're going to see
[59:53] things and I don't necessarily believe
[59:56] that this is just spiritually but I
[59:58] believe it can happen naturally that
[1:00:00] once you get into the spirit on a church
[1:00:02] service at home wherever you are at you
[1:00:04] can see things change naturally you can
[1:00:07] see your home life begin to change you
[1:00:09] can see rebellious teenagers that
[1:00:12] rebellious and start to break off their
[1:00:13] life it's you getting into the spirit
[1:00:16] and start to see changes take place I
[1:00:19] want to see changes in my life don't you
[1:00:22] you want to see changes in your life you
[1:00:24] want to see changes in your family life
[1:00:26] get into the spirit of it get into the
[1:00:29] spirit then you'll start to see things
[1:00:31] happen oh Hallelujah then you'll start
[1:00:33] to see things happen that this ain't
[1:00:35] just an imagination but it's a reality
[1:00:38] but it's getting into the spirit of it
[1:00:40] then you're led to believe these things
[1:00:43] you see we're led to it where the
[1:00:44] brandom says we're Lambs right we're
[1:00:46] sheep we can only Follow by something
[1:00:49] that is leading us said brother Brandon
[1:00:51] he would preach a leadership I believe
[1:00:53] and he would say that whenever you're
[1:00:55] born he said says you're you're led by a
[1:00:57] mama and he says you're LED for a little
[1:00:59] bit then you're handed over to a school
[1:01:01] teacher right and he says the school
[1:01:03] teacher lead you through school and then
[1:01:05] he says then if you're a man you're LED
[1:01:07] back to your father and he teaches you
[1:01:09] business right and he says but if you're
[1:01:11] a girl you're you're handed back to your
[1:01:13] mother and she teaches you how to be a
[1:01:14] housewife and things but then he stops
[1:01:17] and he says but who's leading you now
[1:01:19] you see something is going to lead you
[1:01:22] your your emotions are going to lead you
[1:01:24] condemnation is going to lead you your
[1:01:26] failures is going to lead you or the
[1:01:28] spirit can lead you and show you things
[1:01:32] that can take place in your life oh
[1:01:34] hallelujah it's getting into the spirit
[1:01:36] of and I was listening uh to a to a
[1:01:39] message today and and and I've heard the
[1:01:41] story of anel Mama so many times but the
[1:01:45] but today just struck struck different
[1:01:47] to me I'm sitting there on the couch and
[1:01:48] I I start to weep listening to it
[1:01:50] because it's incredible that this Angel
[1:01:53] mama had a need she knew that that only
[1:01:56] God could save her son and what's
[1:01:57] incredible is her son is dying because
[1:02:00] of it because of things he done you know
[1:02:03] it's not like he's a Christian boy and
[1:02:06] and he's going to church and and
[1:02:07] something just happens but he's sitting
[1:02:10] there in his sins in his addictions in
[1:02:13] his own mistakes and yet this Aunt your
[1:02:15] mama knew if I could just get in the
[1:02:18] presence of God my boy can not only be
[1:02:20] healed but he can be saved and while
[1:02:23] this is going on you know brother the
[1:02:25] Brandon was tell us that that he's in
[1:02:27] Memphis and he's he has to make a flight
[1:02:29] has to catch a flight and he had some
[1:02:31] mail that he was going to go drop off
[1:02:33] and deliver at the post office and
[1:02:35] brother brandom says while he's going
[1:02:37] something is telling him to keep going
[1:02:39] on and he's preaching on being led of
[1:02:40] the spirit that's what that's what
[1:02:41] message it was he's saiding he's walking
[1:02:43] and the voice says keep on walking Keep
[1:02:46] On Walking but the brandom says where I
[1:02:48] don't know where I'm going I'm just
[1:02:49] going to keep walking and he stops and
[1:02:51] he says the voice told him turn around
[1:02:53] and go that way and he thought well
[1:02:55] maybe maybe I'm I'm just hearing things
[1:02:57] but then he heard it again turn around
[1:02:59] and go that way little did Brother
[1:03:01] brandham know that there was an an Mama
[1:03:04] that was in the spirit and the spirit
[1:03:07] would would begin to show her things you
[1:03:09] see the promise of God could not help
[1:03:12] but come to that ant Jam Mama because
[1:03:15] the spirit of God already showed her it
[1:03:17] was on the way cuz you remember what
[1:03:19] would happened he would walk up to the
[1:03:21] to a fence and and an your mama would
[1:03:24] say morning paron and and she would he
[1:03:26] would look and would say how do you know
[1:03:28] me well I I was praying last night and
[1:03:31] then I would go to sleep and he said and
[1:03:33] she would say I had a dream and I had a
[1:03:36] dream that you would have a a certain
[1:03:37] Overcoat on you would have this hat on
[1:03:40] and in that dream you would come by my
[1:03:42] way and I said and she said I'm the sh
[1:03:44] ofite woman you're my Elijah so now
[1:03:47] brother Brandon would know what's going
[1:03:49] on in a dream at 3:00 in the morning
[1:03:52] while brother Brandon was asleep God
[1:03:54] gave her a promise that he was going to
[1:03:57] come by her way and meet her expectation
[1:04:00] so once she got the promise she got up
[1:04:03] in the middle of the night and was
[1:04:04] expecting it brother brandom say she had
[1:04:07] do on her back she was wet cuz she was
[1:04:09] waiting there all night it was somebody
[1:04:12] that would get in the spirit and the
[1:04:14] spirit would show her things that she
[1:04:17] could have but she didn't just stop
[1:04:19] there and say thank you Lord for it but
[1:04:21] she got into action and says I'm
[1:04:23] expecting it I'm going to sit here here
[1:04:26] until God fulfills his promise to me and
[1:04:29] little church once you get into the
[1:04:31] spirit and God reveals to you that you
[1:04:33] can have a Revival don't you say Thank
[1:04:35] You Lord and go back home it's time to
[1:04:38] get into action and say I'm going to
[1:04:41] press for it I'm going to fight for it
[1:04:43] I'm not giving up any inch of ground but
[1:04:46] if God told me I can have these things
[1:04:49] I'm going to have it and little church I
[1:04:51] say your answer is on the way your
[1:04:54] Revival is on the way a renewing a
[1:04:57] refilling is on the way oh don't give up
[1:05:00] in the middle of the night don't give up
[1:05:02] when it's hard don't give up when it
[1:05:04] don't seem like God is answering the
[1:05:06] prayer but if God promised it to you you
[1:05:09] can have it yes sir oh Hallelujah and
[1:05:13] here would come brother brandom and
[1:05:14] brother brandom says he would tell her
[1:05:17] I'm a Healer I I preach Divine Healing
[1:05:20] and brother brandom say she didn't care
[1:05:21] about that she said come in with me he
[1:05:24] didn't tell me you was a divine here I
[1:05:26] don't know all he told me is if you
[1:05:28] would come here God would raise up my
[1:05:30] boy and what is so incredible is brother
[1:05:33] brandom says he would walk into the home
[1:05:35] and he would SE a sign God bless this
[1:05:37] home and he says I've been in palaces
[1:05:40] I've been in mansions but this was the
[1:05:42] most welcoming place I have ever been in
[1:05:44] and brother brandham says that she begin
[1:05:47] to pray oh Hallelujah brother brandom
[1:05:49] says he knew that she had prayed before
[1:05:52] and she sitting there praying and
[1:05:54] interceding then he then she stops and
[1:05:57] says okay now you pray and why would
[1:05:59] brother Brandon pray brother Brandon
[1:06:01] brother Brandon would then would say
[1:06:03] this I said I will pray now now auntie I
[1:06:06] put my hands over on his feet and I said
[1:06:08] Lord I don't know what to say is this
[1:06:11] why you made me miss my plane to come
[1:06:13] here to pray for This Woman's boy if it
[1:06:16] is oh Lord let it be known that you're
[1:06:19] God and you respect her prayers so it
[1:06:23] wasn't brother brandom's prayer that
[1:06:25] would bring her Deliverance it was her
[1:06:27] Prayer by her faith that would bring an
[1:06:30] expectation you don't need a profit here
[1:06:33] you need an expectation by the word of
[1:06:36] God that you can see Miracles that you
[1:06:38] can see the miraculous that you can see
[1:06:40] a Revival that you can have a refilling
[1:06:42] that you can have a renewing then God
[1:06:44] will honor your prayer he'll honor your
[1:06:47] sincerity if you're willing to expect
[1:06:50] big things we're not coming here out of
[1:06:53] traditions we're coming here to expect
[1:06:56] big things I want to see the fire of God
[1:06:59] flow through New Life Outreach I want to
[1:07:01] see a fire of God come and encourage you
[1:07:04] deliver you sanctify you fill you with
[1:07:07] the Holy Ghost I want to see these
[1:07:10] things but do you want to see them come
[1:07:13] on now do you want to see these things
[1:07:17] if you want to see them you can have
[1:07:19] them come on now if you want to see them
[1:07:22] you can have them and brother Brandon he
[1:07:24] would say this here he says brother
[1:07:26] Brandon he he would say the same Holy
[1:07:28] Ghost has led you here tonight so the
[1:07:31] same holy ghost that would bring uh that
[1:07:34] that would lead the shoot of the lead
[1:07:35] the the theel mama he says has led you
[1:07:38] here tonight ain't that powerful that
[1:07:41] the same God that would ground a plane
[1:07:44] not only ground the plane but would keep
[1:07:46] that plane in a perfect time set time
[1:07:49] matter that when brother brandom says
[1:07:50] once he got to that plane he says they
[1:07:52] were boarding the last boarding call
[1:07:54] like ain't that incredible that not only
[1:07:57] did he ground it but he calculated the
[1:08:00] time it would take for him to pray for
[1:08:02] that boy to come back to the airport get
[1:08:04] through security all of this thing all
[1:08:07] of these things was estimated by the
[1:08:10] plan of God that when he would get there
[1:08:13] he would they would be saying this is
[1:08:14] the last boarding call and I don't think
[1:08:17] anything happened by accident everything
[1:08:19] that has happened today has been planned
[1:08:22] by God that you would be here at a pred
[1:08:25] destinated Moment In Time the God can
[1:08:28] meet your
[1:08:30] expectation Hallelujah the God can meet
[1:08:33] your
[1:08:34] expectation Hallelujah brother brandom
[1:08:37] says this and now right right after that
[1:08:39] he says now father God we realize that
[1:08:42] that that that that talking is one thing
[1:08:44] and speaking of a God is one thing but
[1:08:47] when the same God when that same God
[1:08:50] would come and manifest that he is alive
[1:08:55] he said sitting there tell them a
[1:08:56] testimony of the the s j mama and then
[1:08:59] would say talking about you is one thing
[1:09:02] but we want you to come here and
[1:09:03] manifest that you're alive that the same
[1:09:06] God that did that for her you can do
[1:09:09] that here today and then then then I was
[1:09:12] listening to another tape and I know
[1:09:14] this is simple things tonight but but I
[1:09:16] was listening to a to a message and
[1:09:18] brother brandom talks about the blind
[1:09:20] girl that lost her daddy and I'm telling
[1:09:22] you man the these stories were hidden
[1:09:23] home cuz I cuz I've been thinking on
[1:09:25] these things though we can see the
[1:09:26] Supernatural and I'm sing I'm listening
[1:09:29] to it and brother brandom says he he
[1:09:31] just got out of the ambulance right he
[1:09:33] he just healed the the the the mama
[1:09:34] inside of the inside of the ambulance
[1:09:36] and he's working his way trying to get
[1:09:38] back into the building and and he's
[1:09:39] pushing and and it's so funny because
[1:09:42] brother brandom says he's pushing and
[1:09:44] one guy says hey stop shoving brother
[1:09:46] brandom said he pushes again and he says
[1:09:48] I said stop shoving and brother brandom
[1:09:50] says he was whittling with a knife and
[1:09:52] he said oh I'm sorry sir excuse me and
[1:09:54] so why one was in a bad attitude you
[1:09:57] know then here would come a girl saying
[1:10:00] Daddy or I think it was daddy daddy
[1:10:02] where are you daddy daddy where are you
[1:10:04] and what is so powerful is brother
[1:10:06] brandom looked at her and says oh man I
[1:10:09] hope somebody would help her and and she
[1:10:11] kept on saying Daddy Daddy and then he
[1:10:13] stopped well then he said maybe I can
[1:10:15] help her and he says maybe God will heal
[1:10:17] her and you know what brother brandom
[1:10:19] says that he done he says he started to
[1:10:21] work her way work his way to that little
[1:10:24] girl cuz she was still working her way
[1:10:26] through the crowd brother brandom says
[1:10:28] wherever she went he would position
[1:10:30] himself that she would bump into him oh
[1:10:34] come on now it wasn't by accident he was
[1:10:37] watching that little girl wherever she
[1:10:39] would go he would go if she would move
[1:10:42] this way he would go that way if she
[1:10:44] went back this way until they bumped
[1:10:46] into each other and God has been
[1:10:48] following you all the days of your life
[1:10:51] waiting for you to bump into him oh and
[1:10:55] I say we're in Heavenly places tonight I
[1:10:57] think you bump into him whatever your
[1:10:59] need is whatever your expectation is the
[1:11:02] almighty god Jehovah Gyra is walking in
[1:11:06] the building he's bumping into you oh
[1:11:09] you know what the little girl would do
[1:11:11] she would say Excuse me sir I'm trying
[1:11:13] to find my daddy and he would say what
[1:11:15] are you doing here where are you from
[1:11:17] and I love this part of the story he
[1:11:19] would ask her where were you from she
[1:11:21] would say I'm from Memphis but the
[1:11:23] brandom says he looked and seen the
[1:11:24] buses from Memphis he says I could have
[1:11:27] got her there easy but I kept talking to
[1:11:29] her saying why are you here she says I'm
[1:11:32] here to see the Healer and he says well
[1:11:34] the Healer you don't believe that stuff
[1:11:36] and she said oh yeah I heard on the
[1:11:39] radio that there was a man healed a
[1:11:42] blind man that was healed and he read it
[1:11:44] in the scripture that really stood out
[1:11:47] to me she wasn't just taken a man's word
[1:11:50] but there was a scriptural expectation
[1:11:52] to produce a faith and she said I'm
[1:11:55] trying to get to the Healer brother
[1:11:57] brandom says Nah you don't believe that
[1:12:00] we we're living in a scientific age
[1:12:02] don't you think the doctors could help
[1:12:04] you and she says sir I've went to all
[1:12:06] the doctors none of them can help me and
[1:12:08] he says I'm testing her faith said are
[1:12:10] you sure this could happen and she says
[1:12:13] I tell you what sir you give me to the
[1:12:15] Healer I found my own daddy she didn't
[1:12:18] care what she had to do there was an
[1:12:21] expectation that says if I could just
[1:12:24] bump in to the almighty God I can see my
[1:12:28] neede met little church what is your
[1:12:31] expectation are you expecting to bump
[1:12:34] into God if you are grab a hold of him
[1:12:37] cuz what would brother brandom say
[1:12:38] brother brandom say she he looked at her
[1:12:40] and says well I might be him and he and
[1:12:43] she says he she grabbed a hold of his
[1:12:45] coat and would not let him go and she
[1:12:48] says sir I'm not letting you go and he
[1:12:50] says I'm not the Healer but I preach
[1:12:53] Divine Healing and he said she says oh I
[1:12:55] believe it and I love it cuz brother
[1:12:57] brandom says can you just let go of me
[1:12:59] so I can so I can grab your hand and see
[1:13:01] the vibrations she says I ain't letting
[1:13:03] go of you and he said okay grab me with
[1:13:06] your left hand I'll grab your right hand
[1:13:08] so she says okay it was somebody that
[1:13:11] realized I'm in a position to see the
[1:13:14] miraculous I'm in the position Jacob

[1:13:22] the supernatural tonight don't let go go
[1:13:25] pull pull out your renewing pour out
[1:13:28] your expectation and it's so incredible

[1:13:35] your eye bow your head and don't make a
[1:13:37] sh you know bow your head she would bow
[1:13:39] her head and she and brother brownon
[1:13:41] would put it back on her and he would
[1:13:43] say as soon as your faith matches my
[1:13:46] faith he says open your eyes and she
[1:13:48] sitting there with her eyes closed her
[1:13:50] head bow and she says I feel something
[1:13:52] cool and he says okay in the name of the
[1:13:55] Lord Jesus Christ I give you your

[1:14:15] see the miraculous brother Brandon says
[1:14:18] she opened her eyes and says I once was
[1:14:20] blind but now I see could you imagine
[1:14:24] she probably heard that story all of her
[1:14:27] life and the expectation was building
[1:14:29] and she probably had it in her mind that
[1:14:31] one day I'm going to say those same
[1:14:33] words one day I'm going to open my eyes
[1:14:36] and say I am blind I was blind but now I
[1:14:39] see but all of a sudden her wishes her
[1:14:42] hopes her expectations would be brought
[1:14:45] into reality that she could say I once
[1:14:48] was blind but now I see brother brand
[1:14:52] says she would go dancing off and then
[1:14:54] he start started to run brother brandom
[1:14:56] says everybody now was looking at him so
[1:14:58] he takes off running trying to get back
[1:15:00] into the building but he says there was
[1:15:02] a man that would say brother brandom I
[1:15:04] know who you are I've been standing here
[1:15:06] in the rain for eight days and he says
[1:15:09] look at my foot brother brandom says his
[1:15:11] foot was a club foot had no no no Toes
[1:15:14] or nothing and he looked at it and the
[1:15:16] man you know what the man would say he
[1:15:18] says tell me what I must do tell me what
[1:15:21] I must do and then I know you can speak
[1:15:24] the word then I could be made well you
[1:15:26] know what brother Brandon would say Do
[1:15:28] you believe it he says I believe it then
[1:15:31] he says you can be made well and that
[1:15:33] man would go dancing off but the brandom
[1:15:35] didn't stop and said you got to do a
[1:15:37] certain thing you got you got to do this
[1:15:39] you got to do that but he says if you
[1:15:41] can only believe then you can see the
[1:15:45] supernatural you see we don't got to
[1:15:47] work something up we don't got to come
[1:15:49] here and and play some fancy keys and
[1:15:51] and some fancy drum RS in order for God
[1:15:54] to come all we got to do is have an
[1:15:58] expectation
[1:16:00] Hallelujah it was their expectation that
[1:16:03] would say if I could just get into it
[1:16:05] and get into the presence of God brother
[1:16:07] brownon would say this that's what power
[1:16:09] is in the church now but it's controlled
[1:16:11] by a law of by a law and that law was is
[1:16:14] not keeping a bunch of Commandments it's
[1:16:17] a law of faith and Jesus said all things
[1:16:20] are possible to them that believe and if
[1:16:23] you can believe it whatever God will
[1:16:26] lead your soul to believe that is yours
[1:16:30] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:16:32] believe that's what happens when we get
[1:16:34] in Heavenly places we start to believe
[1:16:37] these things we start to get led to
[1:16:39] these things that wow I can actually
[1:16:41] have these things that these ain't MTH
[1:16:43] these ain't imaginations brother Brandon
[1:16:45] would say in one place I want to tell
[1:16:47] you something else work on the pulsation
[1:16:49] the spare of the moment like Joshua did
[1:16:52] like Mary Magdalene did all those just
[1:16:55] that moment when something ISS revealed
[1:16:57] to you grab it and hold to it you see
[1:17:00] that's what happens in an atmosphere of
[1:17:03] believing when the preacher starts to
[1:17:05] preach the seeds starts to preach the
[1:17:07] word it falls into your ground and a
[1:17:10] pulation starts to rise up it starts to
[1:17:13] beat and brother brandom says in that
[1:17:15] moment when it's revealed to you grab a
[1:17:18] hold of it and don't let it go I believe
[1:17:20] that happened with you sister CA right
[1:17:22] you was having some troubles in in your
[1:17:24] body you thinking and and our pastor was
[1:17:26] telling her whenever a pulsation rise up
[1:17:29] when when the spirit of God will begin
[1:17:31] to move and brother Miguel was preaching
[1:17:32] I believe and something would start to
[1:17:34] transpire and she would come up and get
[1:17:36] prayed for and God would heal her body
[1:17:39] that's a witness of the pulsation of
[1:17:41] faith that whenever you get in Heavenly
[1:17:44] places and the word of God is bringing
[1:17:47] up expectations you act upon it you
[1:17:50] don't just sit there and say ah I'm
[1:17:52] going to get at a youth camp I'm going
[1:17:54] to get it at that our meetings I'm going
[1:17:56] to get it if a my favorite preacher is
[1:17:59] here but as soon as you're led to
[1:18:02] believe it act upon it and say God I'm
[1:18:06] going to receive my
[1:18:08] expectation oh Hallelujah if you're
[1:18:11] wanting a Revival as soon as you're led
[1:18:13] to believe it act upon it and say God
[1:18:17] I'm going to receive
[1:18:19] it Hallelujah you see brother Brandon in
[1:18:22] the Patmos vision would would say
[1:18:23] suppose you need healing he says what
[1:18:26] does the word say he says well we have
[1:18:28] read it countless times but did not get
[1:18:31] in the spirit when reading it did we ask
[1:18:34] God for his Spirit to teach us the real
[1:18:37] truth of it if we did we would call the
[1:18:40] Elders confess their sins be anointed
[1:18:43] and prayed for and that would be that it
[1:18:46] might not come immediately but get this
[1:18:48] part but in his Spirit it is all over
[1:18:52] there was no other court of appeal God
[1:18:55] will fulfill his word oh we need to get
[1:18:58] in the spirit then things will be done
[1:19:02] you see he looked at it in the church a
[1:19:04] but he's saying if you need healing you
[1:19:06] got to read the scripture but you in
[1:19:09] order to see the results you got to get
[1:19:11] in the spirit of it so once you get in
[1:19:14] the spirit of it it reveals to you the
[1:19:16] truth of what the scripture says oh
[1:19:19] Hallelujah that's why it's important to
[1:19:21] get into the right atmosphere cuz we
[1:19:23] don't want to just hear ser don't want
[1:19:25] to just hear hear messages and and
[1:19:27] scriptures being read we want the spirit
[1:19:30] to bring to us what it really means cuz
[1:19:33] then once that happens a connection
[1:19:35] happens and he says it might not happen
[1:19:37] right away but in the spirit it's all
[1:19:41] over with in that other dimension it's
[1:19:43] all over with and now our confession is
[1:19:46] bringing our body into subjection oh
[1:19:49] come on now our soul is resting in
[1:19:52] Heavenly places our soul is resting
[1:19:54] we're sealed to the day of our
[1:19:56] Redemption but our body has got to be
[1:19:59] brought into subjection so when our soul
[1:20:02] is being led to believe the promises our
[1:20:04] confession is lining up with our soul
[1:20:07] and bringing our body into subjection
[1:20:11] come on now when your body don't feel
[1:20:12] like worshiping the Lord your your your
[1:20:15] soul that is being led brings it into
[1:20:17] subjection and says I'm going to praise
[1:20:19] the Lord when you don't feel like
[1:20:21] entering into the service your soul that
[1:20:23] is being led to believe brings your body
[1:20:26] into subjection when you don't feel like
[1:20:29] you're you're getting any better that
[1:20:31] Soul brings it into subjection and it
[1:20:34] starts to bring the the results that is
[1:20:36] in the
[1:20:38] spirit
[1:20:40] hallelujah oh I think God is so powerful
[1:20:43] that even if you don't see anything
[1:20:44] happening now in the spirit it's all
[1:20:47] done so all you're doing is bringing
[1:20:50] your body into subjection that's why we
[1:20:52] got to we throw away all of our negative
[1:20:54] confession
[1:20:55] cuz our negative confession don't line
[1:20:56] up with the spirit you see it's our soul
[1:20:59] bringing getting into subjection brother
[1:21:01] Brandon would say that Abraham was
[1:21:03] seeking after a city whose Builder and
[1:21:06] maker was God because God made him a
[1:21:09] promise he was expecting it and I won't
[1:21:12] hold you much longer tonight brother
[1:21:14] Brandon would say this now I know I'm
[1:21:16] doing a lot of reading tonight brother
[1:21:18] Brandon would say this but before there
[1:21:19] can be a creation there has to be a
[1:21:22] Creator and before the creation and he
[1:21:24] say as long as he's revealed it there's
[1:21:27] a fountain open somewhere he says oh if
[1:21:30] we can just see it there's a fountain
[1:21:32] open somewhere for it's revealed to you
[1:21:35] by the Holy Ghost God Is A Healer
[1:21:37] where's his fountain at God fills with
[1:21:40] the Holy Ghost where's that fountain at
[1:21:42] see there's a fountain now or you would
[1:21:45] not have a craving in your heart M and
[1:21:48] he says if there's a desire for these
[1:21:51] things there's a fountain fountain
[1:21:53] flowing of it somewhere but where's it
[1:21:56] at oh I say we're not looking somewhere
[1:21:58] else but it's right here wherever the
[1:22:01] word is being preached that is the
[1:22:03] fountain that is the Fountain of the
[1:22:05] Holy Ghost that can come and meet that
[1:22:08] expectation brother Brandon would say oh
[1:22:10] my how can you take it back and put in
[1:22:13] some historical thing the promis is unto
[1:22:15] you to your children to them that is a
[1:22:18] far off as many as the Lord Our God
[1:22:21] shall call Pentecostal blessings the
[1:22:24] power of God is trying to take his
[1:22:26] church he doesn't fail he doesn't
[1:22:29] diminish he is just as bright and fresh
[1:22:32] today as he ever was and it will always
[1:22:35] be he is eternal he says don't put it
[1:22:38] back in the history books but he is
[1:22:40] fresh and real today and God is trying
[1:22:44] to get his blessings into the church
[1:22:46] he's trying to get it into you if you're
[1:22:48] willing to to accept it and you see
[1:22:51] brother Brandon would tell us in one
[1:22:52] place as as much fast much Faith you can
[1:22:55] release is much power that you have so
[1:22:58] whatever faith that you can release in
[1:23:01] expectation is what you can have and
[1:23:04] brother Brandon would talk about Anna
[1:23:05] the blind woman and and in the message
[1:23:07] expectation he's talking about Anna a
[1:23:10] and Simeon and he says this old woman
[1:23:12] Anna was blind and he says there was
[1:23:14] Simeon he was old and he brother Bram
[1:23:17] says he was kind of half off in his head
[1:23:19] you know and he says both of these
[1:23:20] people was being led by the Holy Spirit
[1:23:23] both of them was being brother brandom
[1:23:25] says that that this woman Anna was blind
[1:23:28] but he says no matter her condition she
[1:23:31] was standing at the right place because
[1:23:34] she was being led of the spirit right
[1:23:36] Hallelujah it did not matter her
[1:23:38] condition brother brandom says she was
[1:23:40] blind but she was being led by the
[1:23:42] spirit and was leading her through the
[1:23:44] crowd leading her through this part of
[1:23:45] the part of the crowd leading her
[1:23:47] through this and brother bam says she
[1:23:49] was winding her way through there and he
[1:23:51] says now if the Holy Ghost could wind
[1:23:54] that open blind woman around all those
[1:23:56] people to get to him how much more can
[1:23:59] he R wind you around these streets
[1:24:01] tonight coming down to get to a spot
[1:24:04] where we believe that he can heal the
[1:24:06] sick he will save the lost brother
[1:24:09] Brandon would say that that that blind
[1:24:11] woman was working her way through the
[1:24:13] crowd because she was expecting him to
[1:24:15] come since she was expecting him to come
[1:24:19] the spir the Holy Ghost would start to
[1:24:21] lead her would start to direct her and
[1:24:23] it see but the brown he he would talk
[1:24:25] about about non and he would say that
[1:24:27] there was a little servant girl that non
[1:24:29] had and and she had seen that non had
[1:24:32] leprosy a a and what what I think is so
[1:24:35] powerful is brother brandom says she was
[1:24:37] conducting herself as a Believer and she
[1:24:39] would look at non brother brandom says
[1:24:41] she had a love for non this this was her
[1:24:43] master and he she would see that he
[1:24:46] would have leprosy and she would say
[1:24:48] only if he was in my home country
[1:24:51] there's a prophet and there's a God that
[1:24:53] can heal him but the brand would say
[1:24:56] that Elisha had never healed leprosy
[1:24:58] before but she believed that he could do
[1:25:01] it so even though she had not seen this
[1:25:04] miracle before she was still conducting
[1:25:07] herself as a Believer oh Hallelujah you
[1:25:10] know what brother brandom says that what
[1:25:12] brought this on she was raised in a home
[1:25:15] under the influence of almighty God and
[1:25:17] he says that influence he would say this
[1:25:20] he said inspiration from that atmosphere
[1:25:23] leted her to say those words so the
[1:25:26] atmosphere of the the influence of the
[1:25:29] atmosphere she was leaving in would lead
[1:25:32] her to say these words that if he can
[1:25:34] only get into my home country God can
[1:25:37] make him well even though I have never
[1:25:39] seen a done before and oh man even if we
[1:25:43] think it's impossible to see the
[1:25:45] miraculous the influence of that
[1:25:47] atmosphere leads our confession that by
[1:25:51] his stripes I am healed it leads our
[1:25:53] confession
[1:25:54] that I'm going to see the Holy Ghost for
[1:25:56] my children the promises unto me and my
[1:25:59] children as many as the Lord Our God
[1:26:01] shall call the influence of that
[1:26:04] atmosphere is n moding My Confession oh
[1:26:07] how you see that's what happens that's
[1:26:09] what will stop on the backbiting is
[1:26:11] getting under the influence of his
[1:26:13] atmosphere then are we're being led a
[1:26:15] different direction with our mouth or
[1:26:17] our expectations is being led a
[1:26:19] different direction it's getting under
[1:26:21] an influence getting under that
[1:26:23] influence then God starts to lead us
[1:26:26] hallelujah and even though she was
[1:26:28] alienated and what I think is so
[1:26:30] incredible is here he would start to the
[1:26:33] prophet would come you know and and he
[1:26:35] the prophet would tell him he's got to
[1:26:36] dip dip seven times in the Jordan so
[1:26:39] even though that that that that uh uh
[1:26:41] her expectation brought brought the the
[1:26:44] the miracle to his doorstep he had
[1:26:46] something to do and many times I know as
[1:26:49] a as a pastor's kid I thought it was all
[1:26:51] of my parents right how many's ever
[1:26:53] thought that you rais up in church man
[1:26:55] dad's a preacher he's a pastor uncles
[1:26:56] are preachers and pastors I've got
[1:26:58] nothing to do but even though I come to
[1:27:01] church and God is here I still got a dip
[1:27:03] in the Jordan right I still got a dip in
[1:27:05] the muddy river and here here non was
[1:27:07] like man I don't think I can do it but
[1:27:10] there was this little girl this little
[1:27:12] girl was conducting herself as a
[1:27:13] Believer saying if you would just follow
[1:27:16] the words of the Prophet you can may be
[1:27:19] made well and little church if we can
[1:27:21] just follow the words of our Prophet
[1:27:23] that says expect big things we can be
[1:27:26] made well for the brandist say so they
[1:27:29] had a little girl there now I want to
[1:27:30] show you the force of a testimony of a
[1:27:34] child who lived in a nation or perhaps a
[1:27:36] family who was under the influence of
[1:27:39] God brother brandom says look at the
[1:27:41] force of her
[1:27:43] testimony a young girl but look at the
[1:27:46] force of it since she was under an
[1:27:48] influence that influence would bring
[1:27:50] forth a force and young girls your
[1:27:52] influence can bring forth a force for
[1:27:54] the influence of the Holy Ghost can come
[1:27:56] in young young boys and teenagers and
[1:27:59] bring forth such a force that you're a
[1:28:01] power house upon the Earth brother
[1:28:03] Brandon would say that a man can live so
[1:28:05] close to God that the devil don't know
[1:28:07] what to do with him that's for you
[1:28:09] that's your promise that's your reality
[1:28:12] that can be your expectation if you're
[1:28:14] willing to get under that influence then
[1:28:16] there's a force that starts to work
[1:28:19] through your testimony you know brother
[1:28:21] Brandon would say that Samson never went
[1:28:23] to the line and says I'm going to tear
[1:28:25] you apart until the spirit of God Came
[1:28:27] Upon him then he says then that's what
[1:28:30] he done and he says if you got something
[1:28:32] wrong tonight feel the spirit of God
[1:28:34] moving on you and tear that thing apart
[1:28:37] oh come on now that's what we need to
[1:28:39] start doing a new life Outreach is when
[1:28:41] we feel the spirit of God the the that
[1:28:43] the bitterness and and the
[1:28:45] discouragement and the high blood
[1:28:46] pressure all of those things that is
[1:28:49] wrong with us we start to tear it apart
[1:28:52] oh Hallelujah condemnation that comes
[1:28:55] against us we tear it apart bitterness
[1:28:57] heart feelings all of these things that
[1:28:59] comes against us we start to tear it
[1:29:02] apart and what the devil meant for evil
[1:29:04] God turns it for good and gives you a
[1:29:07] force of a testimony the devil don't
[1:29:09] realize that every time he trips you up
[1:29:11] and puts condemnation upon you if you're
[1:29:13] a Son of God you're going to get back up
[1:29:15] and that's another force of a testimony
[1:29:18] so what the devil means for evil God
[1:29:20] turns around for good and I'm going to
[1:29:23] bring this to close on this point here
[1:29:25] and and brother brand talking about
[1:29:27] Simeon but talk about him and said he
[1:29:30] was over in the temple and he says all
[1:29:32] all of them wom with all the ladies were
[1:29:34] lined up to you know to to their to do
[1:29:37] their thing there to go into the temple
[1:29:39] and brother branam says then God would
[1:29:41] speak to him and would say start walking
[1:29:44] and he would say where to and he says it
[1:29:46] don't make no difference start walking
[1:29:48] brother brandham says he says walk he
[1:29:50] says do you believe Sons and Daughters
[1:29:53] of God are led by the spirit he says
[1:29:55] here then start walking he says where am
[1:29:58] I going it don't make any difference
[1:30:01] just keep walking now sometimes we get
[1:30:03] tired we get weary we get beat down and
[1:30:06] we don't feel like walking but keep on
[1:30:08] walking there there there there're Simon
[1:30:10] brother brandom says he was teased he
[1:30:12] had one he had he had one foot in the
[1:30:14] grave the other foot was halfway in the
[1:30:16] grave but as soon as God would say start
[1:30:19] walking he was under expectation and
[1:30:21] would say I'm going to keep walking even
[1:30:23] though I made fun of even though it
[1:30:25] might have been let down even though
[1:30:27] maybe I haven't seen it in all of these
[1:30:29] years of my expectation if God has told
[1:30:32] me to walk I'm going to keep on walking
[1:30:35] and brother Brown the Bible would tell
[1:30:37] us that that Simeon would say my eyes
[1:30:40] have seen thy salvation not my salvation
[1:30:44] thy salvation so there once he started
[1:30:47] walking the spirit would lead him to his
[1:30:49] expectation little church Keep On
[1:30:52] Walking you might not know how the
[1:30:54] outcome's going to be brother Brandon
[1:30:55] would say in expectation he says how am
[1:30:57] I going to get out of the stretcher he
[1:30:59] says I don't know just keep walking he
[1:31:02] says he would take the take he would
[1:31:03] take care of the rest he says how am I
[1:31:05] going to get out of the wheelchair he
[1:31:07] says just keep on walking he says I
[1:31:09] don't know how am I going to get healed
[1:31:11] of cancer he says I don't know keep on
[1:31:13] walking how am I going to get healed of
[1:31:15] heart trouble I don't know just keep on
[1:31:18] walking how am I going to tell them my
[1:31:20] mother if I get the Holy Ghost and my
[1:31:22] daddy they belong to a different Church
[1:31:23] Church they don't just they don't get it

[1:31:41] you see CU brother Bram says if you if
[1:31:43] you if you stop walking he says you're
[1:31:46] not going to go anywhere but if you keep
[1:31:48] walking he will take care of the rest he
[1:31:50] would talk about how he says I've been
[1:31:53] been in the ministry a long time and he
[1:31:55] says I've been in this great battle and
[1:31:57] he says I've had some awful obstacles
[1:31:59] I've been over some hard roads he says
[1:32:02] I've been through some hard things but
[1:32:03] he says I wouldn't trade it for nothing
[1:32:05] in the world and he says here is my
[1:32:07] greatest victories my greatest Pleasures
[1:32:10] I had is when I come up against
[1:32:12] something that I cannot see see over
[1:32:15] around it and under it and I just keep
[1:32:17] on walking oh Hallelujah I just keep on
[1:32:21] walking towards it and believing this
[1:32:23] the God Will Make A Way when I get there
[1:32:26] and he says I've never come this far and
[1:32:28] he says all all the distance that I have
[1:32:30] come I have trusted him and he has never
[1:32:33] failed me little church we've come too
[1:32:36] far to end up in discouragement New Life
[1:32:39] hour reach has come too far to turn
[1:32:41] around and to fall apart now you see
[1:32:44] your marriages have come too far to fall
[1:32:47] apart now young people you fought too
[1:32:49] many peer pressures and complexes and
[1:32:52] insecurities to give up now keep on
[1:32:55] walking masas you fought too hard to
[1:32:58] quit walking now come on now preachers
[1:33:01] you fought too hard the to stop now and
[1:33:04] turn around keep on
[1:33:07] walking I don't know how it's going to
[1:33:09] work I don't know how I'm going to get
[1:33:11] out of this discouragement I don't know
[1:33:13] how I don't know how I'm going to get
[1:33:14] out get out of these mind battles keep
[1:33:16] on walking and let God take care of the
[1:33:19] rest let our musicians come tonight
[1:33:22] Hallelujah just keep on walking remember
[1:33:25] brother brownon would talk about Lake
[1:33:27] Erie and would say the lake was having a
[1:33:29] Revival and it was going back and forth
[1:33:32] back and forth and what was it doing it
[1:33:34] was pushing out the trash pushing out
[1:33:37] the trash CU as long as it was moving
[1:33:39] the trash couldn't stay there come on
[1:33:41] now you see if it was if it got still
[1:33:44] and stagnated then trash was coming in
[1:33:47] instead of going out but once it started
[1:33:49] moving then the trash was no longer
[1:33:51] coming in but it was going out now and
[1:33:54] sometimes we get to that point I've been
[1:33:56] there I'm sure all of us can testify
[1:33:59] that we've all been there we get
[1:34:01] discouraged condemnation starts to wear
[1:34:04] us down that that we're we're no good
[1:34:06] for nothing we're you we'll never amount
[1:34:08] to anything we will never do anything
[1:34:11] for God I can never do anything for him
[1:34:14] and then we sit still and we stop moving
[1:34:17] and then this starts coming in this
[1:34:19] thing starts coming in that starts
[1:34:21] coming and all we see is the mistake
[1:34:23] akes is the failures as our past all we
[1:34:25] see are these things but don't worry if
[1:34:28] you can just keep walking if you can
[1:34:31] just keep moving then those things that
[1:34:33] came in will start to go out that's why
[1:34:36] we preach the promises of God when
[1:34:38] you're discouraged when we're when I'm
[1:34:40] discouraged because if I we can show you
[1:34:42] the light brother Brown must say just
[1:34:44] keep walking in the light of his
[1:34:46] promises the Bible would say in Isaiah
[1:34:49] 588 then shall thy light Break Forth as
[1:34:52] the morning and thy hell shall spring
[1:34:54] forth speedily and thy righteousness
[1:34:57] shall go before thee and the glory of
[1:35:00] the Lord shall be thy reward and he says
[1:35:03] Thou shalt call and the Lord shall
[1:35:05] answer Thou shalt cry and he shall say
[1:35:08] here am I if thou take away from the
[1:35:10] midst of Thee the oak that pth forth of
[1:35:13] you of the finger and speaketh vanity
[1:35:15] and I just love that thy light shall
[1:35:18] Break Forth as the morning your health
[1:35:20] shall come back unto thee and the glory
[1:35:22] of the Lord shall be thy reward and I
[1:35:25] say you might have clouds over you right
[1:35:27] now but the light is breaking through
[1:35:30] the light is breaking through for New
[1:35:31] Life Outreach the light is breaking
[1:35:34] through for momies and for daddies and
[1:35:35] for teenagers and for preachers the
[1:35:38] light is breaking through and if the
[1:35:40] light could only break through what is
[1:35:42] my reward the glory of God brother
[1:35:45] brandom says the glory of the Lord is
[1:35:47] his presence Hallelujah that's our
[1:35:50] reward for for for fighting and and and
[1:35:53] for pressing in is the presence of God
[1:35:56] CU sometimes we just don't feel the
[1:35:57] presence of God anymore sometimes we get
[1:35:59] dried up we we we start we like I when I
[1:36:03] go to study sometimes I don't feel the
[1:36:05] presence of God but if I can just keep
[1:36:07] walking the light is going to break
[1:36:09] through my clouds that once that light
[1:36:11] breaks through the clouds my reward for
[1:36:14] walking is his glory is his presence is
[1:36:18] a renewing of the Holy Ghost is a
[1:36:20] refilling is a Revival but you just got
[1:36:22] to keep Keep On Walking let's bow our
