[36:53] through the guy with the microphone and

[36:58] right because I do happen to know that
[37:00] brother Merl gave y'all the answer on
[37:02] that
[37:06] one
[37:08] okay girls in the Book of Matthew who
[37:12] told Joseph that the baby was to be
[37:15] called
[37:16] Jesus he has a very SI oh good all right
[37:21] we got a 30 second timer
[37:25] here
[37:31] an
[37:33] [Music]
[37:35] angel all right
[37:37] boys in the Book of Matthew who told
[37:40] Joseph that the baby was to be called
[37:51] Jesus is it raining
[37:54] outside Gabriel
[37:58] any you adults want to
[38:03] pick Mary was the one who who told
[38:07] Joseph according to the Book of Matthew
[38:10] all
[38:11] right don't look up
[38:13] boys not looking too
[38:16] good
[38:17] huh no I said in the Book of Matthew who
[38:20] told Joseph that the baby was to be
[38:23] called
[38:24] Jesus all right so
[38:30] pretty good pretty
[38:32] good okay let's see here
[38:36] um let's let's look here what else Kobe
[38:40] gave me some here all right boys of the
[38:44] four gospels only one does not say
[38:47] anything about Christ's birth or
[38:49] beginning which gospel is
[38:55] that
[39:05] Mark Mark is correct Mark is
[39:09] correct all right chapters one and two
[39:13] in Matthew and Luke both give detailed
[39:16] accounts of when Jesus was born and then
[39:19] in John 1 and 14 it talks about him
[39:21] becoming word made flesh but Mark does
[39:25] not say anything about it
[39:27] all right
[39:29] um okay
[39:31] so girls to whom did Luke write his
[39:45] gospel what what was what was the
[39:47] purpose behind his writing and and who
[39:50] did he write it
[39:55] to
[40:06] you could probably get some
[40:08] help time is over all right boys oh y
[40:13] y'all got y'all y'all want to y'all want
[40:14] to give an
[40:17] huh well but you didn't ask them it's
[40:20] already over but go ahead and tell us
[40:21] your answer throw something out
[40:25] here
[40:33] huh all right name something God okay no
[40:37] he didn't write it to
[40:40] God okay all right so boys to whom did
[40:43] Luke write his gospel what was what was
[40:46] the purpose of his writing and who did
[40:49] he write it
[40:55] to
[40:57] that's a tough
[41:08] one all right if you don't know it you
[41:10] don't know
[41:17] [Music]
[41:19] it Mara he wrote it to
[41:24] Theophilus and you adults would remember
[41:26] remember that once it's once it was said
[41:28] but he but yes he pinned it to theophus
[41:31] to convince Theophilus all right so who
[41:34] do I go to now uh so it's you boys all
[41:38] right what was the name of the Prophet
[41:41] that predicted the birth of Mary's baby
[41:55] boy
[42:00] Isaiah Isaiah is
[42:03] correct that is right all right
[42:07] girls it it's um um let's
[42:13] see I'm going to give you another
[42:16] scripture Colossians
[42:20] 1:9 for it pleased the blank that in him
[42:24] should all fullness

[59:04] little bit tougher this
[59:07] year this is easy I preached on this a
[59:10] year and a half
[59:16] ago savior savior is
[59:20] correct did you know you mean gamy knew
[59:23] that one pretty good
[59:27] amen all right so there is no savior
[59:30] besides me so when we come up when you
[59:33] hear people talking about Jesus is the
[59:36] second person of the godhead you just
[59:38] ask him where's that found in the
[59:40] Bible you'll never find the second
[59:43] person in the godhead but you will find
[59:46] the uh the the Eternal god Jehovah
[59:47] saying there is no savior beside me
[59:50] there are three scriptures in the Bible
[59:51] that says that there you there are there
[59:54] is no no savior beside me so what
[59:57] happened was the Eternal God created a a
[1:00:01] blood cell in the womb of Mary and then
[1:00:04] God lived in that body Jesus is the
[1:00:09] fullness his body is the fullness of the
[1:00:12] godhead can I hear an
[1:00:15] amen all right
[1:00:17] now huh it matters matters of fact let
[1:00:20] me just let me just read this to you
[1:00:22] here real quickly before we before we
[1:00:24] give the girls uh here but Isaiah 550 45
[1:00:28] and 21 says tell ye and bring near yay
[1:00:32] let them take counsel together who ha
[1:00:35] declared this from ancient time who have
[1:00:37] told it from from that time have not I
[1:00:40] the lord and there is no God else beside
[1:00:43] me a just God and a savior there is none
[1:00:48] beside me look unto me and be ye saved
[1:00:51] all ye ends of the Earth I am God and
[1:00:53] there is none else I have sworn by
[1:00:55] myself the word is gone out of my mouth
[1:00:58] my in righteousness and shall not return
[1:01:00] that unto me now so someone say unto me
[1:01:05] every knee shall bow and every tongue
[1:01:07] shall confess this is god Jehovah saying
[1:01:10] it but in the in the Book of Revelations
[1:01:13] who's every knee going to bow to they're
[1:01:15] going to see Jesus and they're going to
[1:01:18] Bow their need to Jesus it's God's body
[1:01:21] you see that that's what Christmas is
[1:01:25] now God when they kneel to Christ
[1:01:28] they're kneeling to that great Eternal
[1:01:30] God that's living in that Tabernacle
[1:01:32] well I thought I'd put that in there too

[1:02:23] you
[1:02:26] is true or false Jesus Christ Our Savior
[1:02:31] was born on Christmas
[1:02:34] day
[1:02:37] huh that's that that is correct there is
[1:02:40] no date for the birth of Jesus that is
[1:02:43] mentioned in the
[1:02:45] scripture and they took and and
[1:02:48] they and and and they they they
[1:02:52] celebrate uh uh uh December 25th is has
[1:02:57] been the Son of God uh Pagan
[1:03:03] worship hundreds and hundreds and
[1:03:06] hundreds of years before Jesus was born
[1:03:09] huh the son God that's right the s u n
[1:03:13] God they done it you can look at it I
[1:03:15] mean everyone knows it they they and
[1:03:17] they always done it on December the 25th
[1:03:20] so uh can can can you all tell me who
[1:03:23] started it who who brought it the son of
[1:03:25] God's
[1:03:26] birthday it was the it was what Catholic
[1:03:29] it was the Catholic church that's
[1:03:30] exactly right so you know but we don't
[1:03:34] care we we're not we're not into all the
[1:03:36] all the Pagan stuff about it we're just
[1:03:38] glad Jesus was born and we're thankful
[1:03:41] to know that he is our savior amen all
[1:03:45] right let's see um are we I uh I started
[1:03:51] with the girls and I ended with the girl
[1:03:52] or no so I need to end with the boys
[1:03:54] correct is that what I need to do all
[1:03:57] right so here let's let's look here I'm
[1:04:00] looking through
[1:04:01] Kobe's stuff he sent me I'm going to try
[1:04:03] to get you guys a real hard
[1:04:06] one
[1:04:09] huh let's see
[1:04:14] um
[1:04:23] h
[1:04:26] okay what did God when when an angel
[1:04:30] according to Matthew 1 and
[1:04:32] 20 uh an angel tells Joseph the young
[1:04:37] woman uh that he he is about to marry is
[1:04:40] pregnant with a child conceived of the
[1:04:43] Holy Ghost and his name would be
[1:04:46] Jesus and
[1:04:50] um uh the question is why was Jes Jesus
[1:04:54] selected as the name of the
[1:05:02] child an angel tells
[1:05:06] Joseph the young woman he is about to
[1:05:09] marry his
[1:05:10] bre okay let me reward this that I I'm
[1:05:14] just
[1:05:15] reading an angel tells Joseph that the
[1:05:19] woman he is about to marry is pregnant
[1:05:22] with a child conceived of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:24] and his name will be Jesus now this is
[1:05:26] important these
[1:05:29] days why was Jesus selected as the name
[1:05:33] of the
[1:05:52] child why why why why was why why why
[1:05:56] was he named
[1:06:12] Jesus the angel told Mary not
[1:06:17] Joseph the angel told Mary not
[1:06:23] Joseph
[1:06:30] well that is that that is
[1:06:33] correct that's exactly right and I'm
[1:06:37] just trying to understand what the name
[1:06:39] Jesus
[1:06:40] [Applause]
[1:06:44] means
[1:06:47] okay all right
[1:06:49] girls what what you you this this is
[1:06:52] this is back in your court
[1:06:55] oh you could tie this thing
[1:07:01] up the Bible says it it's it's a
[1:07:04] sentence Jehovah Jehovah why was Jesus
[1:07:09] selected as the name of the
[1:07:12] child the reason that Jesus was selected
[1:07:16] as well you already said Jehovah saor
[1:07:20] huh Jehovah Jehovah savior
[1:07:30] it it it it yeah I mean it it it it it
[1:07:33] is actually that he would save his
[1:07:36] people from their sins and so that's
[1:07:39] what the and we'll take that because
[1:07:41] that is
[1:07:43] salvation but but the but uh yes but
[1:07:46] that he he says his name is Jesus
[1:07:48] because he will save his people from
[1:07:51] their sins so should we give these girls
[1:07:54] that that that
[1:08:02] answer huh I know well sometimes you

[2:25:17] you the
[2:25:19] parable of the
[2:25:28] apples there we
[2:25:31] go there was a certain professor of
[2:25:34] religion named Dr Christensen who taught
[2:25:36] a small college in the United States Dr
[2:25:39] Christensen taught the required survey
[2:25:42] course in Christianity at this
[2:25:44] particular Institution every student was
[2:25:47] required to take the
[2:25:49] course he if his or her freshman year
[2:25:53] regardless of his or horror major
[2:25:56] although Dr Christensen tried hard to
[2:25:58] communicate the Essen the essence of the
[2:26:02] Gospel in his class he found that most
[2:26:05] of the 16-year-old students looked upon
[2:26:07] the course first year students 16 first
[2:26:11] year not old that's all
[2:26:14] right that's okay they're most of his 16
[2:26:18] first year students looked upon the
[2:26:21] course as nothing but required drudgery
[2:26:24] despite his best efforts most students
[2:26:26] refused to take Christianity
[2:26:28] seriously this year Dr Christensen had a
[2:26:32] special student named Caleb Caleb was
[2:26:35] studying with the intent of going onto
[2:26:38] Seminary for the ministry Caleb was
[2:26:41] popular he was well-liked and he was an
[2:26:44] imposing physical specimen he was the
[2:26:47] starting center on the football on the
[2:26:50] school football team and was also the
[2:26:52] best student in the professor's class
[2:26:55] one day Dr Christensen asked Caleb to
[2:26:58] stay after class so he could talk with
[2:27:00] him Caleb how you doing good how are you
[2:27:04] hey I got a question for you how many
[2:27:06] push-ups can you do I do a hundred every

[2:28:21] was pretty excited it was Friday the
[2:28:23] last class of the day and they were
[2:28:26] going to get an early start on the
[2:28:27] weekend with a party in Dr christensen's
[2:28:36] class Dr Christensen went to the first
[2:28:40] girl in the first row and asked

[2:29:31] Christensen put an apple on Charity's
[2:29:36] desk Dr Christensen then went to

[2:37:38] there leave it right there now by this
[2:37:42] time Caleb had begun to slow down a
[2:37:44] little he just stayed on the floor
[2:37:46] between sets because it took too much
[2:37:48] effort to be getting up and down you
[2:37:52] could start to see a little perspiration
[2:37:54] come out of around his brow Dr
[2:37:57] Christenson started down the third row
[2:37:59] now the students were beginning to get a
[2:38:01] little angry Dr Christensen asked
[2:38:04] Brianna
[2:38:05] Brianna do you want an
[2:38:10] apple
[2:38:12] Caleb Brianna doesn't want an apple but

[2:40:01] guess but they're in college together so
[2:40:03] we'll give them the benefit of the
[2:40:05] doubt Austin's the oldest or maybe uh
[2:40:09] Dylan did an accelerated program and he
[2:40:11] got done with high school

[2:41:20] do 10 push-ups so he can have an apple
[2:41:23] that he doesn't even
[2:41:26] want
[2:41:31] Yeah by now a growing sense of
[2:41:34] uneasiness filled the room the students
[2:41:36] like Robert Austin and dilling were were
[2:41:39] beginning to say no and there were all
[2:41:41] these uneaten apples on the desks Caleb
[2:41:45] also had really put forth a lot of extra
[2:41:47] effort to get these push-ups done for
[2:41:49] each apple there began to be a small
[2:41:52] pool of sweat on the floor beneath his
[2:41:54] face his arms and brow were beginning to
[2:41:57] get red because of the physical effort
[2:42:00] involved as Dr Christensen continued
[2:42:03] four students from another class
[2:42:05] thinking there was a disturbance in Dr
[2:42:07] christensen's classroom had wandered in
[2:42:10] and sat down in the window sill when the
[2:42:14] professor realized this he did a quick
[2:42:16] count and saw there were now 19 students
[2:42:19] besides Caleb in the room he started to
[2:42:22] worry if Caleb would be able to make it
[2:42:25] the first newcomer Dr Christensen went
[2:42:28] to was Colton he asked no I'm sorry I I
[2:42:31] had to change that because they they
[2:42:32] weren't available
[2:42:35] uh U didn't get with
[2:42:38] you U so it's Luke and Paul Luke and
[2:42:43] Paul first newcomer was Luke
[2:42:49] Luke how'd you get in
[2:42:52] here you're not in my
[2:42:55] class you just walked
[2:42:57] in I guess I just you know I finally
[2:43:00] noticed you were sitting here this guy
[2:43:02] here two ladies over there they're not
[2:43:05] in my class
[2:43:07] either but since you're
[2:43:10] here do you want an apple yes
[2:43:14] sir Caleb was really having a rough
[2:43:19] time he was taking a lot more time to to
[2:43:22] complete each
[2:43:24] set he asked the next person
[2:43:38] Paul Luke Paul just did 10 push-ups so
[2:43:41] you can have an
[2:43:42] apple Paul Paul I don't know how you got
[2:43:46] in here either but you're here yeah

[2:43:55] an apple free Apple yep what about it
[2:43:58] Caleb you want to you want to do 10
[2:44:01] pushups so so these these guys from off
[2:44:03] the street another class come in here
[2:44:06] sure they want an
[2:44:08] apple Kaleb sced but managed to do 10
[2:44:12] more push-ups Dr Christensen gave an
[2:44:14] apple to each Luke and
[2:44:20] Paul a few moments later Jonah a recent
[2:44:24] transfer student came to the room and
[2:44:26] was about to come in when all the
[2:44:28] students yelled in one
[2:44:33] voice Jonah didn't know what was going
[2:44:35] on Caleb picked up his head and
[2:44:38] said in here Caleb Caleb hold on hold
[2:44:43] on do do you
[2:44:46] realize that not only for all the kids
[2:44:48] in the class you're going to have to do
[2:44:50] 10 more push-ups for Jona so he can get
[2:44:54] an Apple I'll do it for him
[2:44:57] too
[2:44:59] wow come on
[2:45:01] in Caleb do 10
[2:45:05] push-ups we'll just let you get Jonah's
[2:45:08] out of the way right
[2:45:10] now I messed up
[2:45:14] there
[2:45:15] Caleb did 10 push-ups very slowly and
[2:45:18] with great effort Jonah bewildered was
[2:45:21] handed an apple and sat
[2:45:26] down Caleb's arms were now shaking with
[2:45:29] each pushup in a struggle to lift
[2:45:31] hisself against the force of gravity
[2:45:34] sweat was profusely dropping off of his
[2:45:37] face and by the time there was no sound
[2:45:40] except for heavy
[2:45:42] breathing there was not a dry eye in the
[2:45:44] room
[2:45:50] the very last two students in the room
[2:45:52] were two young ladies both cheerleaders
[2:45:55] and very popular Dr Christensen went to
[2:45:58] Haven the second to the last and
[2:46:02] asked young lady I know you're you're
[2:46:05] not in my class I haven't seen you
[2:46:06] before I've seen you in the hallway and
[2:46:08] walking around and other classes and uh
[2:46:12] know this is your first year and uh I
[2:46:15] don't recall your name Haven Haven
[2:46:18] that's a pretty name
[2:46:20] Haven Haven just like the rest these
[2:46:24] kids uh would you uh would you like
[2:46:29] Caleb to do 10 push-ups so you can have
[2:46:31] an apple would you like an
[2:46:33] apple um no thank you no thank
[2:46:37] you Haven doesn't want an apple
[2:46:41] Caleb maybe she sees how worn out your
[2:46:45] getting and how much effort you're
[2:46:46] putting into this and but I just want to
[2:46:50] know do you have the strength to do 10
[2:46:53] more push-ups so Haven can have have an
[2:46:55] apple that she doesn't
[2:46:59] want grunning from the effort Caleb did
[2:47:02] 10 very slow push-ups for
[2:47:13] Haven then Dr Christensen turned to the
[2:47:17] last girl
[2:47:19] Eliana you're Eliana
[2:47:23] right
[2:47:25] Eliana do you want an apple Eliana with
[2:47:29] tears flowing down her face began to
[2:47:36] cry no no
[2:47:38] Aliana Caleb has to do it
[2:47:42] alone I have given him this task
[2:47:46] and he is in charge of seeing that
[2:47:48] everyone has an opportunity for an apple
[2:47:52] whether they wanted or
[2:47:54] not when I decided to have a party this
[2:47:57] last day of
[2:47:59] class I looked at my grade
[2:48:01] book Caleb is the only student in this
[2:48:04] class with a perfect
[2:48:07] grade everyone else in this class has
[2:48:11] failed a test skip
[2:48:13] class offered me inferior
[2:48:19] work Caleb told me that when a player
[2:48:22] messes up in football
[2:48:24] practice he must do
[2:48:27] push-ups I told Caleb that none of you
[2:48:30] could come to my
[2:48:32] party unless he paid the
[2:48:35] price by doing your work your
[2:48:39] push-ups he and
[2:48:42] I made a deal for your
[2:48:48] sakes
[2:48:50] Caleb can you would you do 10
[2:48:56] push-ups so Eliana can have an
[2:49:03] apple as Caleb very slowly finished his
[2:49:07] last
[2:49:09] pushup with the understanding that he
[2:49:11] had accomplished all that was required
[2:49:14] of him
[2:49:15] having done 200 push-ups his arms
[2:49:18] buckled beneath him and he fell to the
[2:49:20] [Music]
[2:49:25] floor and so it
[2:49:27] was our Savior Jesus
[2:49:31] Christ the only perfect sacrifice the
[2:49:34] only one worthy the only one
[2:49:37] able to pay the price for our
[2:49:41] sins to give us a salvation by grace
[2:49:46] died on the
[2:49:48] cross pled to the
[2:49:52] father it is
[2:49:55] finished into thy
[2:49:57] hands I commend my
[2:50:01] spirit with the understanding that he
[2:50:04] had
[2:50:05] done everything that was required of
[2:50:09] him he yielded up his
[2:50:12] life and some of the those in this
[2:50:17] room many of
[2:50:21] us left the
[2:50:24] gift on the
[2:50:26] desk
[2:50:28] unreceived
[2:50:31] unappreciated
[2:50:34] uneaten two students helped Caleb off of
[2:50:38] the floor and into a seat physically
[2:50:41] exhausted but wearing a thin
[2:50:43] smile

[2:54:07] Earth and to dwell with us it was a it
[2:54:10] was his pleasure you know you know and

[2:54:17] Paid uh uh you know the scripture says
[2:54:21] it pleased God to to bruise him not that
[2:54:24] God bruised him but that he was that he

[2:55:41] my narrator I've done this little skip
[2:55:43] before
[2:55:45] and uh I thought well let's have uh Kobe
[2:55:49] and there write this and I'll just we'll
[2:55:51] just kind of acted out so uh this is
[2:55:56] called uh the
[2:55:59] man and the birds all right brother
[2:56:05] Kobe the man to whom I'm going to
[2:56:08] introduced to you was not a scrooge he
[2:56:10] was a kind decent mostly good man
[2:56:14] generous to his family upright in his
[2:56:17] dealings with other men but he didn't
[2:56:20] believe all that Incarnation stuff which
[2:56:23] the churches Proclaim at Christmas time
[2:56:27] it just didn't make any sense and he was
[2:56:30] too honest to pretend otherwise he just
[2:56:33] couldn't swallow the Jesus story about
[2:56:35] God coming to Earth as a
[2:56:38] man I'm truly sorry he told his wife but
[2:56:43] I'm not going with with you to church
[2:56:45] this Christmas
[2:56:46] Eve he said it feel like a
[2:56:48] hypocrite that he'd much rather stay at
[2:56:51] home and that he would wait up for
[2:56:54] them and so he stayed and they went to
[2:56:57] the midnight
[2:56:59] service shortly after the
[2:57:02] family drove away in the
[2:57:05] car snow began to
[2:57:08] fall he went to the window to watch the
[2:57:12] flurries getting heavy and
[2:57:18] heavier and then went back to his
[2:57:20] Fireside chair and begin to read his
[2:57:31] newspaper minutes later he was startled
[2:57:34] by a thuing
[2:57:36] sound then another and then another sort
[2:57:40] of a thump or a thud the world was that
[2:57:44] first he thought someone must be
[2:57:45] throwing snowballs against his living
[2:57:48] room
[2:57:50] window but when he went to the front
[2:57:52] door to
[2:57:54] investigate uh oh sorry brother window I
[2:57:57] need
[2:58:02] help here let's just put this right
[2:58:04] there on you right
[2:58:08] now yeah in your pocket
[2:58:12] yeah
[2:58:18] he found a flock of birds huddled
[2:58:21] miserably in the
[2:58:23] snow they had been caught in the storm
[2:58:26] and in a desperate search for shelter
[2:58:27] had tried to fly through his large
[2:58:30] landscape
[2:58:31] window well he couldn't let the poor
[2:58:33] creatures lie there and freeze so he
[2:58:36] remembered the barn where his children
[2:58:38] stabled their
[2:58:40] Pony that would provide a warm shelter
[2:58:42] if he could but direct the birds to
[2:58:46] it quickly he put on a coat
[2:58:51] gashes through the deepening snow
[2:58:54] to the barn
[2:58:56] sorry he put on his
[2:59:01] coat his
[2:59:09] gashes and trample through the deepening
[2:59:12] snow to the
[2:59:20] Barn he opened the doors wide and turned
[2:59:23] on a
[2:59:26] light but the birds didn't come
[2:59:32] in he figured food would entice
[2:59:36] them so we hurried back to the
[2:59:40] house and fetched
[2:59:42] breadcrumbs
[2:59:49] and began sprinkling them on the
[2:59:52] snow making a trail to the yellow
[2:59:55] lighted wide open doorway of the
[3:00:01] stable but to his dismay the birds
[3:00:04] ignored the
[3:00:06] breadcrumbs and continued to Flap around
[3:00:09] helplessly in the snow wrong
[3:00:12] with he tried catching
[3:00:19] them he tried sh them into the barn by
[3:00:22] walking around waving his
[3:00:27] arms instead they scattered in every
[3:00:31] direction except into the warm litted
[3:00:37] barn and then he realized that they were
[3:00:40] afraid of
[3:00:41] him to them he reasoned I am a strange
[3:00:46] and terrifying
[3:00:47] Creature if only I could think of some
[3:00:50] way to let them know that they can trust
[3:00:54] me that I am not trying to hurt them but
[3:00:58] to help them but how because every move
[3:01:02] he made tended to them confused them
[3:01:07] they just would not follow they would
[3:01:10] not be led or shed because they were
[3:01:13] Afra afid of
[3:01:14] him if only I could be a bird he thought
[3:01:17] to
[3:01:18] himself and be with them and speak their
[3:01:23] language then I could tell them not to
[3:01:27] be
[3:01:28] afraid then I could show them the way to
[3:01:31] be safe and warm to the safe warm
[3:01:35] barn but I would have to be one of them
[3:01:39] so they could see and hear and
[3:01:42] understand me at that moment the church
[3:01:45] bells begin to ring the sound reached
[3:01:48] his ears above the sounds of the
[3:01:51] wind he stood there listening to the
[3:01:54] bells listening to the bells peeling the
[3:01:58] Glad
[3:01:59] Tidings of
[3:02:01] Christmas and he sank to his knees in
[3:02:04] the
[3:02:04] snow and began to cry out to
[3:02:07] God lord now I see I hear and I
[3:02:12] understand now I know why you came to us
[3:02:15] to be with us to Simply tell us not to
[3:02:18] be
[3:02:19] afraid saying I will be with you even in
[3:02:23] you until the end of the
[3:02:25] world soon his wife and his kids arrived
[3:02:30] home safe and
[3:02:33] sound he excitedly told them the
[3:02:37] news the next day they had the best
[3:02:41] Christmas ever the end
[3:02:44] [Applause]
[3:02:55] do you enjoy
[3:02:56] [Applause]
[3:03:04] that
[3:03:09] wow
[3:03:12] that's that's a
[3:03:14] story but it's real
[3:03:19] too I'm glad God found a
[3:03:23] way throughout the Old
[3:03:28] Testament God tried everything in his
[3:03:30] power
[3:03:33] to get the people to come to him to go
[3:03:36] to
[3:03:38] safety he done everything to show
[3:03:42] him
[3:03:48] but God loved us so
[3:03:52] much the man couldn't become a
[3:03:56] bird it's impossible for a man to become
[3:03:58] a
[3:04:01] bird but the Creator can do what he
[3:04:03] wants
[3:04:05] to and the Creator
[3:04:10] chose to come a human
[3:04:16] being come and save
[3:04:19] us and appoint us to
[3:04:24] [Music]
[3:04:25] safety what a blessed savior we
[3:04:29] have how I love
[3:04:31] him
[3:04:34] tonight I know there's a lot
[3:04:37] of lot of religions a lot of things
[3:04:41] there's a lot
[3:04:42] of
[3:04:46] a lot of preachers in it for
[3:04:48] money lots of
[3:04:50] people building
[3:04:54] kingdoms that we don't know which way to
[3:04:56] go many of
[3:04:58] times but just because there's
[3:05:01] some folks
[3:05:05] that claim to have it and ended up not
[3:05:09] having it doesn't mean that Jesus
[3:05:10] doesn't have
[3:05:12] it and I know that he loves us
[3:05:17] tonight the great
[3:05:20] Jehovah became my savior aren't you glad
[3:05:24] for that
