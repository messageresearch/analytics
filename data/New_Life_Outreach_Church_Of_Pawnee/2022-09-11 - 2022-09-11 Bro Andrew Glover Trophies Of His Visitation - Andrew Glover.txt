packed so we finally went amen but we sure appreciate brother kenny and all the men of god here if you have your bibles today while you're standing we want to turn the book of luke the 19th chapter i'm actually going to borrow a scripture from brother ronnie he was ministering here wednesday night and made a reference to this scripture and read it and i leaned over and shared a quote with brother wendell and i told him i said no i won't swear you the secrecy on this don't share this so he's a trustworthy man amen amen you come to a meeting with direction it don't work amen you get minister studying from the same message and that's a blessing amen all saying the same thing that's the that's the blessing of a meeting like this is men of god studying the same message and everyone's saying what a prophet said with no confusion pure clarity amen we thank god for it let's bow our hearts together for a word of prayer just before we read the word we know the word is inspired this morning but how many could say lord inspire my faith in your inspired word to receive from you heavenly father lord all across this building this morning hands have been lifted father lord hearts have been lord brought into an atmosphere of faith into an atmosphere of worship an atmosphere of praise lord we feel your presence charging this building this morning and father we know it's not a man it's not a idea it's not a personality but lord it's your presence that has come down among us and lord it's not just any presence but it's the identified presence of jesus christ and in that presence lord your prophet said nothing can remain the same we'll either leave better or we'll leave worse but today god as we prepare to close out these meetings and go our separate ways in a few hours lord we want to say this morning we're leaving here better father we're not leaving here more educated or more intellectual or more puffed up oh god but lord we're leaving here changed by your presence lord we're leaving here charged by your spirit now lord as we come to this final service i know there's still lord no doubt many needs among us father but lord your word is still true and your power is still real and your spirit is here to still bless us all so father if there be one here this morning that is not lord push me on doubt and push beyond all the things is trying to hinder them in these meetings i pray this morning god may the angels of god come and take their post of duty this morning and drive out every demon of doubt lord ever demon of unbelief that your children could come to complete victory and lord we ask you to bless brother wendell father may you bless this assembly may you bless the church oh god every every effort that's been put forth every dollar that's been spent lord father to see that these meetings would be a success dear god may you reward him abundantly father and lord we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believer says amen and amen the book of luke the 19th chapter and the 41st verse i also want to say i'm glad to have my wife here this morning i don't see her with the baby but there she is uh brother wendell you're a lot braver than i've ever been hey band but we're sure glad to have her and little malachi with us and appreciate her making the trip out here amen luke the 19th chapter in the 41st verse when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou had us known even thou now i know that you know there's a scripture in revelation 3 that brother bran preaches from it and knoweth it not if thou had us known even now at least in this thy day that the things which belongeth unto thy peace but now they are hid from thine eyes for that they shall come upon thee that thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee around and keep thee in on every side and shall lay thee even with one with the ground and thy children with thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another now listen at this because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation i also want to look in the book of first peter the second chapter of the book of first peter the second chapter i just want to pull one verse of scripture from there first peter 2 we want to look at the 12th verse you love the lord here this morning amen we thank the lord for the reading of his word amen there's peter 2 and verse 12 peter here writing says having your conversation honest among the gentiles that whereas they speak against you as evil doers they may by your good works which they shall behold glorify god in the day of visitation glorify god in the day of visitation we ask the lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here today we thank the lord for the reading of the word of god amen from those passages of scripture i want to if i can read you a statement here the prophet of god actually in a prayer in 1962 the uncertain sound and from this quote is where i would like to draw our title this morning the prophet said heavenly father i pray the i pray the prayer for them with all my heart i give them to you their trophies of the message they are trophies of your visitation being here tonight seeing you walk among us doing works that has never been done since the foundation of the world until these last days here they are they're your children amen i commend them to you lord you give them to us and we give them to you in the name of jesus christ watch over them and raise them up at the last day i may never be able to shake their hands on this earth but when the battle is over how many believers were headed there when the battle is over and the last trumpet is sounded and the dead has risen from the grave and the life has been called up together with them to meet the lord in the air then may i have fellowship with jesus christ and them around the throne through the eternal ages that is to come granted lord they are yours in the name of jesus christ i want to this morning to speak to you on trophies of his visitation amen trophies of his visitation i believe what job said he said in job 10 12 he says thou has granted me life and favor and thy visitation has preserved my spirit amen how many could agree here this weekend that we have had a visitation of the almighty god amen right here in pawnee oklahoma now as you start studying on visitation you'll hear brother branham say chicago you're getting your visitation vanilla illinois you're getting your v your visitation he'll go to jeffersonville and say jeffersonville you're getting your visitation he'll go to phoenix and say you're getting your visitation he'll go to germany and stand right there and say you are getting your visitation now amen to the carnal mind they would say well that preacher is trying to make something out of himself amen that he has graced us with his presence to come to our place and to visit us but he was trying to move you beyond the veil of humanity move you on beyond the veil of a preacher and let you see that this is not william branham visiting germany but this is the living god visit in germany this is not william branham this in chicago this is the living god that is visiting chicago and i want to say this morning this has not been amen emmanuel salazar visiting pawnee oklahoma it's not been any of these other preachers visiting pawnee oklahoma it has been the living god himself amen come down in the form of flesh has visited this generation this weekend and this visitation has not been just to stimulate our flesh it has not been just to make us feel good or feel better amen but this is a visitation amen that is preserved spirits amen they've been people here that have come to press are leaving with joy people that's compound they are leaving free people that's come sick they've been there leaving well people that has come confused amen they're leaving with clarity you know why amen because god has visited this generation in this hour and this weekend to preserve thy spirit amen psalms 102 verse 13 david said thou shalt arise and have mercy upon sign amen you know what zion is it's a type of the bride for the time to favor her yay the set time is come listen your hour of visitation is not coming and it has not been amen this is your hour of visitation the prophet of god would say may the fire of god begin to fall may the power reach down and pick up the people and shake them lord and let them realize that this is the day of their visitation that this is the time amen that the lord has set this is the time for their healing amen this is not any kind of time this is a special time it's an appointed time it's in a time of adoption it's a time of visitation amen you're living in a season that god himself listen before he was ever born god set this date on the calendar before you ever got saved god had this time in his mind you're not stumbling into something by accident it is the sovereignty of almighty god that is leading you to the place where god is calling you in the age that you're living in this is the time for healing this is the time for salvation this is the time for joy this is the time for the miraculous this is the time for the supernatural listen if you keep on waiting on it and then you're gonna be like a kid sitting on the curb waiting on a bus and the bus will show up and it'll go on and you won't get on it and you'll miss your ride amen but there's a bride here this morning who is not going to miss her hour she is not going i know i might as well go and preach i'm here that devil's told you over and over and over you're going to miss the rapture can i tell you something how can you miss something that you are how can you miss something that the very reason there is a rapture is for you to go into it listen we are not a helpless hopeless bunch of people we are the bride of jesus christ who has recognized our day we have recognized its message we have recognized the anointing that is sweeping throughout the building and there's some people that says devil get out of my way this is my hour this is my message this is my time this is my season in the sun every generation receives a visitation every generation has a chance at a revival the prophet said and we faithfully kind heavenly father that this great visitation in our generation that we're living in now to see things come to pass i love this he said i thank thee tonight for the holy ghost and for the visitation of him right here in this building even right here now the very spirit listen the very spirit according to the word of god which is infallible and cannot fail the same spirit that raised jesus from the grave is right here in our midst now the same spirit that raised jesus from the grave is not in heaven this morning it's not in the tomb of jerusalem it's not in a tomb in jeffersonville amen but the same spirit that raised our lord from the dead that same spirit is in this building this morning come on do you know what you are you're not a bunch of chickens you're eagles you are sons and daughters of the heavenly now come on amen i heard a song here last night amen set your wings eagles to the winds of faith brother manuel something struck my heart amen the eagle doesn't put the power in the air the power is already there the eagle doesn't put the ability in the air the ability's already there do you realize what the eagle does he yields himself to the power that's in the air and as he yields himself he goes higher oh come on church right here this morning the rapture is in this building right here this morning the resurrection is in this building right here this morning there is a host of theophanies that is in this building listen it ain't no telling what can happen if you would yield yourself to the spirit of god that is already in this field by the baptism of the holy ghost by the restoration of the word what we need is here but you'll never receive it unless you yield to the spirit that is here to raise you into this think of that the same spirit that went into the grave and rose jesus from the dead is the same spirit that's in this building this morning the same spirit that went to lazarus grave and said lazarus come forth that spirit is in this spirit the same spirit that stopped the funeral procession for the widow of name son that spirit is in this building you know why this is not a message of death it's a message of life this is not a stale expired warmed over microwave message this is the green pastures that david spoke of this is the still waters that david said he will lead you and would guide you to in the hour of your visitation this is the table that has been prepared in the presence of your enemies i'm on church some of you right now is waiting to shout till you ain't got no enemies you'll never shout come on somebody you're waiting to praise god until you ain't got no enemies you'll never praise god but david said amen i'll eat in front of my enemies i'll shout in front of my head and these and there's some people here this morning that you got enemies that would love to see you dead they would love to see your home destroyed they would love to see this church broke up but i got my shout shoes on this morning i'm not gonna wait until i'm on the other side i'm gonna shout here right now i'm gonna let my enemies watch me praise god i'm gonna let my enemies peace on the seventh hill man i'm gonna let my enemies watch me eat this spiritual food in into season he prepares a table in the presence of your enemies he anoints your head [Applause] come on you got enemies but you got blessings you got enemies but you got food you got enemies but you got god are you hear me you didn't stumble to this table you was led to this table and the same spirit that was in the grave is in this building here this morning oh god i feel like preaching the same spirit that was in the that was in the grave is in this building this morning what does romans 8 chapter and the 11th verse say if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead if it dwell in you that he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you in other words quickening power is not coming when you become immortal quickening power is here in your mortal body are you hearing me listen well brother andrew someday when quickening power comes i propose to you that quickening power is here this morning well someday when the power to change our bodies comes young man i propose to you this morning that the power to change your body it's not a million miles off in some distant universe it is circling through this building hallelujah how do people get out of wheelchairs because healing is circling through the building and they yield their body to the spirit that they feel how the cancers leave bodies because healing is leaving it's surrounding the building and they yield their body to the spirit they're feeling then how are you going to go from being 50 years old to being 18 years old because there's a word concerning you and it's yielding and it's surrendered and it's surrounding you and one of these mornings you're going to yield to it for the final time and gray hair is going to turn back back again stupid shoulders are gonna come straight we're gonna see your loved ones appear behind you i'm not a crazy man i've recognized my day i've recognized this visitation man has not visited me this weekend elohim has visited me el shaddai has visited me if that spirit race took jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you i want you to see it now we know what it done for him but i want you to see rise of the sun 65 i want you to see it not will it has done the same for you it's not going to do it it's already done it [Music] brother wendell if jesus christ was standing here this morning in this suit of clothes that he'd give me he could do no more for you than what he's already done you know why because it's not a man it's almighty god come on now what does it do it quickens the mortal body this mortal body we live in it quickens it in other words it brings it to life the visitation of the spirit of god quickens the seed of god and brings it to life now once you walked with a great big cigar in your mouth you had a bunch of cigarettes and you women had short hair and painted and carried on and wore shorts things like that but something screamed and you looked down here and it was the word my screamed in word same quote it screamed and it was the word you said no more shorts for me no more liquor for me no more lying no more stealing the more this see the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection amen you see what it is subjection to what to the word and who is christ christ is the word not in the subjection to theology but subjection to the word come on now if we're going to take a body change our bodies have got to be brought under subjection to the word see not a part of the word but the full word then you say well these things oh i think that's all right amen for women to wear slacks when the word said no it quickens you to that you are drowned oh god you are drawn to it see you become a part of the word i say it like this if there's ever been a time and then to realize the seriousness of the visitation of god the time is now if there's ever been a time to recognize that okay how can i say it lord to recognize the meetings that you're sitting in to recognize the sermons that you're hearing to move into the atmosphere that you're i'm not we don't know how many more of these meetings we're going to have we don't know how many more services we don't know how many more gatherings we're going to have why do we let one minute of it pass us by we ought to move into the atmosphere of it you see because this is not the ideas of a man being preached it's the gospel being preached like it was in the days of noah you know what it is it's fanaticism to the world amen but it's welcome and glorious to those who are willing to come into the ark of safety and the ark of safety is christ well i'm this close to a devil sometimes we'll cut his head off brother andrew i don't think we need to close the prophet of god too much amen will you tell me how you're going to preach the ark and not mention noah well i don't think we ought to quote brother brown how are you going to preach israel leaving egypt to not mention moses how are you going to preach amen about milk caramel and not mention elijah i'll tell you what that is that's a devil that's come in the church and a bunch of penny-wasted preachers that didn't have a backbone with nothing bow their knee and let that devil invade the pulpit and we got kids that's been raised in the message they don't even know what the prophet said i say it's time to take the gloves off and cut the head of that devil and bring the liberty bring the word back in the church until every heart every family every ministry every young person becomes subject to what a prophet is saying in the age that we're living in take the gloves off and preach or go flip hamburgers this ain't a job this ain't about your personality fault come on this is souls this is between life and death this is eternal destination we ain't playing games it's the word or nothing it's the word or nothing i'll go a step further and say it's this message or nothing [Applause] you got to come subject to what the prophet said if you're going to move into the ark of safety in the age you're living in see it's a serious power see i want to draw from another prayer the prophet said lord by your grace your help i claim somebody say i claim i claim everyone that hears this message i claim them for god i pray thee lord both here this morning and those that will hear on tape if there be a seed anywhere that's predestinated lord to hear the word of this day may they come now sweetly and humbly and laid their trophies down at the cross notice what he says he turns it from their trophies he says or their self as a trophy lay their trophies down at the cross or their self as a trophy of the grace of god that's called them may they be filled with the holy spirit and this place somebody say this play this play the token of the life of jesus christ in his resurrection as long as they remain here on earth then a prophet was not preaching you as victorious just in the millennium he was not preaching you as a trophy of god just on the other side but brother william he was saying as long as they remain on the earth may they be trophies of the grace of almighty god may they be trophies of his visitation may they be more than just church members can i preach this morning may they be more than just singers may they be more than just clothers may they be more than just young people may they be a city which will be a light that will be set on the hillside come on you know brother said like this he said watch he reads matthew 5 ye are the light of the world you are a city that is set on a hill that cannot be hid neither do men light a candle put it under a bushel put it on the candlestick and give it the light and give the light unto all that are in the house so let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works come on what did peter say he said evil doers will always speak against the move of god they will always speak against the works of god if you're waiting on the critic to be quiet before you recognize that this is god you'll never recognize because you'll criticize for they can't criticize no more but somebody's going to recognize somebody's going to recognize this is more than a bunch of quotes this is more than a bunch of pictures this is more than a bunch of tapes this is elohim returning to this age in the power of this resurrection in the power of his anointing to lead you to a body change to lead you from the realm of mortality to the realm of immortality to lead your corruptable to incorruption to lead your sickness into health this is the visitation of god in this generation you remember the prophet of god said he was driving down the road and he said there was a sign a billboard and the billboard said hungry three miles he said see if i needed an automobile he said it would have never done no good he said but i was hungry and he said when i saw the sign he said the advertisement paid off and the advertisement pulled me to the restaurant he said in this age it pays to advertise he said that it won't it pay christians to advertise come on now he said what is the advertisement you got to have like the things in the world it'll never attract the attention of the people now if a man would have been looking for an automobile he would have went on past the sign oh god if he had been looking for an automobile he went on past the sign if he had been looking for another church service he wouldn't pass the sign if he would have been looking for another idea he would have went on past the sign but i heard a prophet say you're getting your last sign come on now if you pass this sign there's no more signs coming according to the bible the final sign would be the sign of jonas which would be the sign of the resurrection which would be the sign of the son of man the messianic sign returning this church listen if you pass this side there is no more signs coming it's the end come on it's the end are you hearing me it's the end if a man would have been looking for something else he would have never come so i believe that the christian is god's billboard i believe each one of you is god's billboard and we don't have so much carrying on about what we do just simply live a life such a life that'll make people hungry to be like you how many knows that a trophy must be advertised it must be displayed nobody receives a trophy and wants to hide it come on now nobody receives a trophy and goes and puts it under their bed or goes and puts it in their closet amen but when they receive a trophy they want everybody to see they want everybody to hear they want everybody to behold are you hearing me trophies must be displayed i love the definition of the word trophy it is something that is gained that is achieved or is given in victory or conquest especially when preserved or mounted as a memorial thy spirit rope though god thy visitation will preserve my spirit thy visitation of god will preserve the spirit of the believer who receives that visitation and by receiving that visitation you will become more than just a member of new life outreach you will become more than just a person sitting on a pier carrying a quote book reading a few scriptures you will become oh god you will become a trophy of the dissertation of the angel and the age that you're living in you will be put on display it is something that's given as a representation of the memorial as a medal now listen now come on hunters it is a game animal it is a game animal or a fish amen and is mounted for a trophy it's usually used attributively so a trophy is connected to an attribute well thank god for a prophet who said god's secret mystery was in the back part of god's mind there was something he was trying and was going to achieve a trophy is an achievement oh god a trophy is something that is mounted it is something that is put into the onlooker's view it is something that somebody can look at and they can see it's a trophy see he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't a moon a star an atom a molecule or anything but he was god see and god is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a healer all these great attributes we see were in god listen you didn't put them in him they were already in him the only thing you did was you pulled them out of him and become a trophy of the attributes that was in him from before the foundation of the world no wonder a prophet could stand and say you are trophies of his visitation your eyes have seen things your ears have heard things your heart has believed things your mouth is confessing things that has not been thought of seeing spoken heard since i put this mystery in the back part of my mind but in the end times there would come a voice called the voice of the sabbath angel who would break into the mind of god and would begin to declare the thoughts of god and you would become more than just tears you would become more than just showers you would become more than just dancers you have become trophies by the visitation of the mind of god in the age of living well i feel good it's sunday morning i feel like shouting i'm not defeated i'm victorious i'm not the overcome i'm the overcomer all because i recognize the hour of my visitation can i preach this morning can i preach this morning you know what you are i'll tell you what the prophet said you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene of life that was in god as the son of god are you ready for this now you're expressed after his word has come into you to light up this h the word that's in you is the lie of the age the word has come into you to light up this hate you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or daughter of god you are now made sitting in the church today because your duty your duty is to express god to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate amen your duty as a trophy your duty as an expression of the attributes of god your duty as a man your duty as a woman your duty as a young child is to manifest god to express god come on church to be a reflection of the living god in the age that you're living in now listen amen i said to you like brother brown said god before there was a foundation of the world knew that you would be here when you arrived you didn't take god by surprise come on church when god revealed malachi 4 luke 17 30 john 14 12 mark 11. all these scriptures that we've heard all weekend long when he revealed those things brother manuel he did not reveal them hoping there would be eyes upon the earth to see what he was revealing he revealed that brother josh knowing when the revelation broke there would be eyes to see it there would be ears to hear it there would be a heart to receive it there would be a mouth to confess it come on can i go a step further there would be a body to manifest it there would be a body oh god there would be a body on the earth in position to receive the word and to manifest the promise of that word listen to the word of god did not come into your flesh your flesh is an unbeliever the word of god did not come into your spirit alone your spirit is a mate believer but the word of god come into your soul and that soul is the real you well that's sunday morning brother william and we might as well cut some devil's heads off is there any soul christians here is there any soul christians is there any christians here that are not christians by the flesh you're not christians by doctrine you're not christian by theology you are christians from your soul well let me ask that again is there any soul christians here we say what makes you a soul christian your flesh has given you every reason not to be here and you're here anyhow your spirit has given you every reason not to be here and you're here anyhow you know why kobe because there's a soul in there it's a real soul your flesh is not the real you your spirit is not for real you but the soul on the inside of you is what received the gene of god in this age and that word lit our souls we come from time beings from mortal beings into eternal beings but hold on church we're not going to be trapped in time some morning between six and nine some morning between six and nine our god is gonna visit this earth and he's gonna gather all these trophies together what are you saying i'm saying get ready church we're going home i'm saying get ready church we're not staying here we're only so turners we're strangers and we're just passing through we got a destiny we gotta finish line the cross are you hearing me get your marching shoes on get the staff in your hand keep on eating the lamb [Music] come on somebody come on you say what are you doing i'm preaching the word of god what a prophet called me to do what a prophet god come on what the prophet called me to do was preach the word somebody said well why don't you play tapes i do and i'm doing what i heard on the tapes but pete said if you're called to preach get in the pulpit and preach listen i'm not fighting with you i'm just preaching somebody said well andrew don't you think we ought to set the preachers down and put a tape player in the pulpit listen i'm not going to argue with you i'm just going to answer you the way a prophet answered it it wasn't so from the beginning tape player behind the puppet was not sold from the beginning i'll tell you what was so from the beginning them screaming hollering talking acts 238 eagles being born under the influence of the holy ghost listen i am not a starchy stiff self-righteous aristocratic message believer i am a son of god we're the gene of god i've been lit by the power of god i'm not staying here i'm not getting cold i'm not getting formal you can die in the smoke but there's some people here who was born in the fire and the smoke will kill them they got to be under the influence where there's power to lift them out of situations where there's power to raise them out of circumstances somebody needs to cut that devil's head off and be a man about this message and say what the prophet said [Applause] well don't say nothing all right that's what the pentecostals did and that's why they got televisions in their home come on somebody because nobody took a stand to express god in the age we're living listen this may not be popular but it's a truth anyhow god needs more than your feet he needs more than your hands he needs more than your eyes he needs your voice to say what a prophet has already said [Applause] say what he said i am saying what he said and you're not hug it's a spirit i'll cut its head off don't push me i am saying what he's saying i am saying what he said the problem is you've been taking what a man said he said instead of hearing for yourself what he said what a man said he said ain't what he said a man never said okay brother man never said god please play in heaven he said god was the father of truth come on somebody but a man got involved and twisted things it's got people believing all kinds of crazy things and we got young people sitting in pews ripped on pornography come on somebody you know why because you silence the watchman in the tower every devil in hell will infiltrate that church but there are some thoughtful ministry there are some young men there are some young women there are some believers here who have not come to this age to express a man's idea brother manuel we have come to this age to manifest the foul god well brother andrew i think it's getting a little too quiet amen i'll tell you what something the other day has it ever dawned on you we are not following the pillar of us we are following the pillar of fire but we're not following a stick of ice we are following the pillar of high you know what the pillar of fire does the pillar of fire comes into a room and it begins to whirl the pillar of power begins to move it begins to go up and down the aisles it begins to go in between the pews and it begins to brood and your seed only inside of you begins to yield to the fire of god and that seed becomes expressed are you hearing me you didn't come here just to manifest the church you didn't come there just to manifest an office you come here to be a trophy real preacher i don't like that i done said it i meant it i stand behind it and i represent it [Applause] what a prophet taught well somebody shot glory outs on me my or something it's the truth anyhow there is no devil safe in the house of god don't say nothing don't say nothing okay we won't say nothing before long that's why you got girls wearing makeup again those won't nobody say nothing that's why we got deacons married three and four times because what nobody say my question is how long is it going to be before there's so many elephants in the room we can't even shout no more because we won't say anything about the devil that's trying to steal the sound but i think it's time to take your credit and kick that devil back to the hell that he come out of i think it's time to take back your possession i think it's time to take back your tour come on by the way i think it's time to take our dance back i think it's time to take a shot back i think it's time to take the ability to take the gloves off and just say what the prophet said it's time to take it back keep that devil out of here i said some of y'all right now won't kick that name cause he's telling you well if you're new to me if you kick me i'm going to torment you if you come against me i'm going to entice you can i let you in a little secret that devil's going to torment you whether you kick him or not so i decided i'm going to kick him and give him a run for his money i'm gonna kick you in the prophets you're gonna kick him in the pews and we're gonna kick him back into hell we come out we're not defeated beings by the meds we are the trophies we are the living the trophies of the dissertation come on i know some of y'all right now come through this prayer line you know what you come through last night you come through as sick what you left is a trophy you come through bound but you left here is a trophy you know why because somewhere between your pew and that prayer line you met god somewhere in that prayer line you met the fire of god and you know what it did it cleansed you it washed you it separated you now you say brother andrew it's getting a little noisy in here i'll tell you what the prophet said he said if you think this is noisy he said if you think this is noise he said if you think that that noise out in tucson the other day was a little noisy he said you just wait until the earth receives her fiery baptism you think 250 believers gathered up in pawnee oklahoma is making so much noise that you're getting nervous and you're thinking oh it's going to get out of here you just wait until the fire of god drops upon this earth and begins to burn off every sin begins to burn off every field but come on church i might as well preach i'm here if we can shout right now we ought to be able to shout about this one of these days that devil has tormented you is going to be burnt from the window that devil discouragement is going to be burnt that devil is sickness for the jonathan it's gonna be birth come on somebody young people that devil lust is gonna be burnt you know why because this earth don't belong to the devil it belongs to you this earth don't belong to russia it belongs to you and any man knows you don't take the wife far from mama are you hearing me you don't take your wife too far from mama and this wife of jesus christ is the bride of jesus christ and this earth is what a prophet called her mama come on church god's not taking you to some far-off planet that's never been heard of he's going to lift you off of the earth i'm so far ahead of myself and ain't even funny he's going to lift you up off the earth ain't going to seat you in a millennium while he sends fire down upon this earth and he's gonna cleanse this earth and make it fit for kings and priests to come back upon the word of god has lit our souls oh god page two brother speaks much about trophies he speaks much about trophies in the message can i tell you what he says he says it like this he said now notice he normally refers to trophies in prayer he said trophies of this meeting trophies of the message trophies of the presence of the lord trophies of the grace of god trophies of the spirit of grace trophies of christ's love at calvary trophies of the gospel that has been preached trophies of your word lord being manifest preached by the spirit of the lord trophies of the message trophies of the evening time light you know what i love brother brother jonathan is when mother man refers to trophies he refers to people he connects people to trophies for the durham in other words he'll take you to the scriptures and show you by the scripture you are a trophy in john 5 24 he'll say he that heareth my word and believeth on him that has sent me half everlasting life and shall not come in the condemnation but is past from death and alive in john 6 37 jesus will say all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out in john 10 28 i given them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand remember i said they're trophies of your word that condemn their sinful life and they come to accept you as their personal savior you know what oh i can't get bogged down here brother bryce but can i tell you a good sign of a trophy is when the word corrects you you don't stay home for a month you come back to church [Applause] well glory to god it's sunday morning and we might as well preach when the word condemns your sinful ways you don't blow up like a bullfrog eating buckshot and get mad at the preacher get mad at the evangelist you say that ain't nothing but the truth shut the head off of me i want to be a word bride the brandon said the word condemned them and they still repented he said i'm pleading to the promise bring them back to remember it's another place i claim their life i come i say acclaim i claim their life in the name of jesus christ i want to meet them at the other side on that immortal turn back to young men and women again any young lovely father oh i'm old church my brain was preaching this knowing he was ripping the heart off of people but he wasn't doing it for prejudice he was doing it for the truth and it's getting quiet but it'll get quiet it'll get quiet we'll get right through that quietness are you hearing me it'll get to a place where people will not repent we're there nobody's wrong everybody's right nobody oh come on but you know what a problem god said he said a true sign is repentance he said a fur repent now listen not a repentance because you got caught but a real repentance from your heart will actually bring a change in the life of the individual amen they are trophies that god has given to his son jesus by the power of his presence and the word of god then do you realize what this message is it's a claiming message the message of the hour is a claiming message the gospel of jesus christ is a claiming message he said i claim them for you tonight jesus as your own personal treasure and gems in your crown as members of your bride i claim their lives the sixth seal may every child of god that's in hearing distance up here or either the tape shall strike may at that time i claim them for the kingdom of god upon the basis of knowing that this is the word that's being revealed he was claiming you up on the basis of the revealed word let the evening light shine i commit them to you in jesus name then can i turn a corner here and say brother robert you didn't claim this message but this message claimed you are you hear me the you didn't claim the reveal word the revealed word claimed you the part of god will say this you were not claimed on accident you were claimed for a purpose and nothing to paraphrase it nothing can defeat the purpose of god then can i say to you like this you didn't claim the rapture tested one to his story you didn't claim the rapture the rapture claimed you are you hear me you didn't claim the rapture the rapture claimed you are you with me you didn't claim to be a part of this bride the revealed word of the hour claims your brother candle to be a part of the bride of jesus christ what are you saying i'm saying this the rapture has claimed your body for its fulfillment [Applause] amen and what there's still brother wendell saying i'm preaching better than your amen are you hearing me the rapture claims your body for its fulfillment are you hear me the rapture claims your hair to turn back black again the rapture claims your eyes to see loved ones appear in the mirror behind you the rapture claims your heart are you hearing me you didn't claim this rapture this rapture claimed you and you know what he didn't just claim you it claimed your sons it claims your daughters have owned church it's time to quit sitting back and let the devil pack our babies out let the devil pack our families out hollywood wants to claim them but we claim them for the dissertation we claim them we claim our young people we claim it's time to put your shoulders up and claim it's time to stand there and say devil you ain't taking these the rapture's claiming

you've done been claimed well brother andrew you don't know my family background too late god didn't ask your family if he could claim you all right he didn't ask your family he didn't ask nobody he just went ahead and done it oh god brother joel i thought shout right now he didn't ask your enemies can i claim him for the rapture can i claim him for the body change oh no he put a seed in you that a preacher didn't have nothing to do with he put a seed in you that mom and daddy did he was born with a claim already in you by the predestinated foreknowledge of almighty god what are you saying i'm saying you couldn't get away if you wanted to i'm saying you can run but you can't hide you can go to the belly of the well but they'll find you there if your name is on the lamb's book alive you might as well go ahead and yield to the power of the seed that's on the inside of you it's drawing you to a rapture your flesh don't want to go but it's going anyhow your spirit don't want to go but it's going anyhow you've been claimed you've been claimed to be a trophy of the visitation come on church can i tell you what god's trophies are they're not dead trophies they're living trophies most trophies have to be killed to be mounted then they're dead trophies they're symbols of a past experience are you hearing me but can i tell you something my god's a trophy hunter [Applause] no you

we're so happy [Applause] we're so happy to see you here i said i don't understand this and then that voice that was speaking from above me said you know it's written in the bible that the prophets were gathered with her people and i said yes i remember that in the scripture i said well this is why you go with your people i said then they'll be real and i can feel them oh yes i said there's millions but there's not that many branhams and that voice can i preach this morning i'm just about done but that voice said they're not branhams they're your converts that's the ones that you've led to the lord i said some of them women there that you think are so beautiful we're better than 90 years old when do you let the lord no wonder they're screaming no wonder they're screaming oh god you

message it was a changing message it was the message of grace it changed me they screamed all at once if you hadn't went we wouldn't be here and i looked around i thought well where's jesus i want to see him they said now he's just a little higher someday he'll come to you they said this said you were sent for a leader and god will come and when he does oh god he'll judge you according according to what you taught them first whether they go in or not i might as well take the gloves off a preacher for a second for a bunch of these uninspired backslidden facebook youtube preachers that want to tell us everything brother said was his opinion we'll go in according to your teaching [Music] well if you're going to get on the internet says program's opinion then get on there and say you're not going to go in because this bride is going in according to his teaching we'll go in according to your teaching i said oh i'm so glad did paul a scripture prophet did paul have to stand like this does peter have to stand like this yes i said that i've preached every word that they preached i never needed one went from it i preached the baptism i preached the holy ghost said jesus will come and you'll be judged according to the word that you preach and if you're accepted that time are you hearing their confession are you hearing their speech are you okay brother manuel how do we break this down are you hearing the words that are coming out of their mouth they're not standards about your helpless hopeless in ensure well i don't know it might be true it could be right it could no we'll go

its perfect impact because this message is it's got that conquering power we have that within us hallelujah i tell you what i feed on that i feed on this message all the time and that's the reason i

the country you can be seated for a moment amen we've come from different parts of the country and we're all um amen we appreciate everyone i appreciate brother brother bryce for and his congregation for being here today god bless you and dismiss their service to come again brother ben we appreciate you being here uh the noel church where's where's brother timothy at where you got brother timothy o'brien's brother timothy amen brother timothy dismissing the service today to be here and we appreciate the knowledge church uh some of you that are here we we just appreciate all of you pastors local areas here that that are come to join us and we we we just so appreciate that it means listen we don't take that for granted we know it it takes a lot i don't like dismissing our services for any reason uh hardly at all and so and i know that's the way you brothers are but we appreciate you for for um for dismissing and appreciate the saints for coming after your pastor dismisses amen that's that's what's rough is when pastor dismisses and then no one shows up and says oh boy my church but we appreciate all of you who came and um and and was apart you know we got a real special occasion here this morning and this this building is a is a is a fairly new building and um we're going to have some vowel renewals for for brother jeff and sister ruth proctor and they if y'all want to just make your way on up and they have been they have been married now they they live over around the oklahoma city area and um we've we've met them uh some years back and and um we're just delighted that they're here with us this morning their son is back there god bless you and um so how how long have you all been married now uh tomorrow will be 30 years 30 years tomorrow isn't that wonderful amen and i'm glad i'm glad we get to do this here this is going to be the first vowel renewal and then here uh you know in a week or so we're also going to have our first wedding we've had weddings since since we've been here but it's been other places and so uh we're just we're just glad to do that this will be the you'll be the first and um as i as i begin to think about about marriage and i just wanted to express this before we do the vowels is is you know marriage is an incredible thing and the devil is is is doing everything in his power in this hour to to minimize and destroy the family and you young men and and and you young ladies and you know it's it's it's it's easy to uh look at that pretty girl and that handsome guy and uh and and say boy i want that one and the other one said yeah i want you to but the facts are here in oklahoma there are more divorces than there are marriages half of the half of the marriages end up in divorces this is this is an incredible thing and so what when you see somebody like this a couple like this 30 years of marriage it's somebody that has been committed a husband to his wife and a wife to her husband because it does take submission to one another even though our brother is the head it takes love between the two can you say amen and we need these kind of examples and it and it it it makes me think of the um they're in first john 4 and 16 it says and we have known and believe the love that god hath to us god is loving he that loveth or dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect it's a relationship it's something that that your love can only be made perfect through fellowship and what we're seeing today i i in a minute when we do the vows i i have a feeling that you love more today than you did the first day and and and there's there's there's that something way down what is it it's been the fellowship over the years brother branham talked about the man his name was oswald smith he says when you're first married it's easy to quit talking about the pretty girl and and that you're married it says when you're first married you don't have much investment yes she's pretty yes it looks like a good thing and but if it doesn't work out it'd be easy enough to to walk away and he says after 10 years and then it'd be a little harder and 20 years it'd be and and this man was already 50 years in marriage and he says i've already been 50 years i can't live without her and and that's the way i am with my wife my wife and i have been married now for 33 years and i got to say today i would never want life without my wife and how how beautiful she is and i say today i love her more today and she's more prettier pretty to me today than she's ever been amen that's right and so amen and and so oswald said and then when the children come along and then when you've got so many things invested in one another it would just absolutely be hard amen brother branham loved this this uh this poem this is like that like to that above we share our mutual woes our mutual burdens bear offer each other often for each other flows a sympathizing tear if we asunder part it gives us inward pain but we shall still be joined in heart and no we'll meet again brother branham in the in the revision church age he said also in this ephesian age the true church had lost its first love the love was typified as the love of bride and groom at their marriage and early years of wedded life and then there's a cooling of that complete love and that abandonment of love and he's talking about how the church began to cool off and sometimes and i and there's a reason i'm i'm saying this publicly like this because i want all of us today in our marriages as he's as they're renewing their vows let's never let our love cool off to one another let's let let's always be sweethearts and as our brother and sister is renewing their vows i think that it would be a good thing can you say man for all of us brother bradham says hatred had a beginning so it must have an end love has no beginning so it has no end hatred is forever love is eternal hatred begins and hatred will end love never did begin and it never will end it's eternal [Music] it says and when a man loves a woman and marries her because she's just pretty there'll be an end to that but when a man finds a woman that he loves he don't know why but he loves her and she finds the man that she loves no matter what he looks like hey man you're going a little bald but it don't matter amen [Music] i had to point that out she probably didn't see it amen he loves her she loves him that's an eternal mate in glory death nor nothing else can ever separate them because they are from eternity they step out into space of time and will return back to eternity eternity has dropped down in a body called time and then it goes right back into eternity again it cannot perish it's a forever thing isn't that a wonderful thing and as we express our i go through these vows here 30 years later i wonder brother jeff if you just repeat after me i jeff take thee ruth to be my wedded wife to have and to hold from this day forward for better or for worse for richer or poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till god by death does separate us therefore i pledge my faith [Music] amen i had to throw that in there because at our first wedding i messed up the vows right and i said till we both die so i had to throw that in there so this is a true renewal name amen okay yes amen praise the lord nobody's enjoying yourself this week [Applause] amen praise the lord [Music] now sister ruth you repeat after me i ruth take thee jeff to be my wedded husband to have and to hold from this day forward for better or worse for richer or poorer in sickness and in health to love and to cherish till god by death does separate us and thereto i pledge my faith [Music] i want to pray for you both
