[41:21] good works we might do no matter how
[41:24] many times we might beat our backs with
[41:26] different things
[41:27] that different ones have tried Through
[41:30] the Ages to try to earn it nothing that
[41:33] they could do could get to God it took
[41:38] him coming down
[41:41] [Music]
[41:42] and being in a human form like us to pay
[41:45] the price so that way he could bring us
[41:48] up to
[41:52] him let's go ahead and open our Bibles
[41:55] and we're just going to turn to
[41:58] the front of the Bible Genesis chapter
[42:07] 1 Genesis chapter 1
[42:11] and we're going to start at verse 26
[42:31] and God said let us make man in our
[42:33] image after our likeness and let them
[42:36] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[42:38] and over the fowl of the air and over
[42:39] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[42:41] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[42:44] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[42:47] own image in the image of God created he
[42:49] him male and female created he
[42:52] them let's go ahead and
[42:56] pray Lord Jesus we come into your
[42:58] presence this evening Lord
[43:00] and Lord
[43:02] we lord all we can say is that we thank
[43:06] you Lord and that we love you and we
[43:09] appreciate all that you've done for us
[43:11] Lord Lord as always were a needy people
[43:15] Lord whether there were written requests
[43:17] Lord I know that there are needs on
[43:19] every heart that's here Lord and Lord
[43:21] I'm just a mortal man I don't know what
[43:25] type of situations every every person is
[43:27] facing I know what don't know what type
[43:29] of worries or concerns or problems they
[43:31] may be dealing with but but Lord you
[43:34] know each and everyone Lord Lord we pray
[43:36] that you would just take control of the
[43:38] service Lord take control of my my lips
[43:41] Lord may I just say what it is that you
[43:43] would have me to say Lord may it be
[43:45] uplifting to the people may it minister
[43:47] to the needs Lord and Lord may we be
[43:48] able to to walk away knowing that that
[43:52] we didn't hear from from me we didn't
[43:54] hear from Harry Lancaster but we heard
[43:56] from from you Lord that you are the one
[43:58] to speak to us Lord Lord I pray that you
[44:01] would just take control of the remainder
[44:03] of the service and we just commit it
[44:04] into your hands the name of the Lord
[44:06] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have
[44:09] your
[44:15] seats brother brandom in the sermon uh
[44:18] in 1953 questions and answers on
[44:22] Genesis he starts to describe
[44:27] and dramatize the way that brother
[44:30] brandom does what it was before creation
[44:36] he
[44:38] describes that it was
[44:41] just God there was nothing else and it
[44:44] was even he wasn't really called God yet
[44:48] because God means to be an object of
[44:50] worship so he was just the self-existing
[44:54] one and he was there and then brother
[44:58] brandom describes that you see uh the
[45:01] light of the logos come into being and
[45:04] he says it's like a a child playing in
[45:06] front of his father's
[45:09] house and this is goes
[45:12] on in this Timeless space since there
[45:16] was no time you have no idea how long it
[45:18] was this was the the condition and
[45:21] then God begins to brother brandom the
[45:24] way he says is God begins to think and
[45:26] begins
[45:27] to consider what he wants to do and what
[45:30] he wants to create and what he wants to
[45:32] make and till finally he goes to the
[45:35] point of beginning to say Let There Be
[45:39] and he goes through the process of
[45:41] creation and goes through the process of
[45:44] making everything that we know to be in
[45:46] the
[45:48] universe and he goes through this
[45:50] process and
[45:52] he and brother brandom obviously does
[45:55] such a great job dramatizing talks about
[45:57] this atom explodes and this happens and
[46:00] this happens and this little clinker is
[46:02] flying off here and this is flying off
[46:04] there and what is God doing well he's
[46:07] creating the Zodiac he's creating the
[46:08] first Bible in the sky and then he goes
[46:10] on and does this and does this
[46:15] and he goes through every one of these
[46:19] steps and then at the end he goes down
[46:24] and everything has been created before
[46:26] for he has all these different things
[46:29] but yet God's desire through all of this
[46:31] is that he wants to have fellowship with
[46:35] someone yes he has had the angels that
[46:37] can worship him that can praise him but
[46:39] he wants to have someone that he can
[46:41] visit with and talk with and have a
[46:44] relationship with and so he makes the
[46:47] decision let us create man in our image
[46:51] I want to create something that can
[46:53] fellowship with me that's in
[46:57] that's
[46:59] not less than or but it's like me I want
[47:04] to create something that it's in my
[47:06] image this is what I'm making and so I'm
[47:09] going to
[47:11] create ma male and female created he
[47:13] them as the scriptures say
[47:16] and Genesis 2 Verse
[47:20] 18 and the Lord God said it is not good
[47:22] that man should be
[47:24] alone I'll will make an help meat for
[47:26] him him so God had created Adam he had
[47:29] put him on the earth to to tend the
[47:31] garden to to take care of everything
[47:33] that was there yeah but the same desire
[47:36] that God had in himself for
[47:39] Fellowship he looked at Adam and he
[47:41] could see Adam is
[47:43] alone the same way that I have been
[47:46] alone for so long now Adam is in this
[47:50] same condition Adam is in the condition
[47:52] where he needs that fellowship and he
[47:55] needs that Fellowship because I made him
[47:57] like me I made him in my image and so
[48:01] the thing that I desire is what Adam
[48:04] desires if I desire fellowship if I
[48:07] created man because I want
[48:09] Fellowship then this man needs
[48:11] Fellowship yes he has the animals to
[48:15] rule over he has the garden to tend but
[48:17] he doesn't have anyone to talk to and
[48:19] yes I come down on the evening and I
[48:21] visit with him but he doesn't have
[48:23] anyone the rest of the day he doesn't
[48:25] have anyone that's that's there with him
[48:27] he doesn't have anyone that he's
[48:29] connecting to that he's relating to that
[48:32] he's building this relationship with all
[48:35] right and so he chooses to put Adam to
[48:38] sleep and and take a rib and
[48:42] he splits the spirit as brother brand
[48:46] describes he says he takes the male the
[48:49] Burly spirit and he puts it in the man
[48:52] in Adam and he takes that tender little
[48:54] delicate feminist spirit and puts it in
[48:57] the woman all right and now you have man
[49:00] and woman together and they are able to
[49:03] have
[49:04] Fellowship they are able to be
[49:07] together and the whole reason that they
[49:10] had that desire the whole reason that
[49:12] God would choose to give
[49:15] Adam this woman to give him Eve is
[49:19] because Adam had the same desire that he
[49:21] did because he had chosen to make God In
[49:25] His Image
[49:27] he didn't choose to make him like the
[49:30] bear or like this or like that take your
[49:32] pick of what animal was out there but he
[49:35] went
[49:36] no they're going to be in my image which
[49:39] means they're going to have the same
[49:40] desires they're going to want the same
[49:42] things they're going to have that same
[49:44] tug that they want to be able to have
[49:46] this
[49:47] relationship they want to be able to
[49:49] have communion they want to be able to
[49:51] have fellowship with one
[49:55] another brother brandom says in the
[49:57] sermon Fellowship in 1955 he says
[50:00] Fellowship wonderful thing now why does
[50:03] men like Fellowship why is it men like
[50:06] to meet with men women meet with women
[50:09] we all like to meet together the Le
[50:11] ladies meet together and sew and talk
[50:13] and the men go to a table and they have
[50:15] things in common they like to talk about
[50:18] that come from
[50:20] somewhere what makes you love your
[50:21] children because you're a father that's
[50:24] that's a strain a human strain that's
[50:26] the reason it proves that we have a
[50:28] heavenly father that loves we his
[50:30] children all the things is now made of
[50:32] things that was the Bible said there's
[50:35] nothing new in the world now in the
[50:36] beginning when God made man he didn't
[50:38] make him to be sick he didn't make him
[50:40] to have cancer he never made him to die
[50:43] he made him for Fellowship now in the
[50:45] evening when it was quiet God came down
[50:48] and had fellowship with Adam and
[50:52] Eve and in 1959 in uh dedication of
[50:56] building to the Lord Brother Ram says
[50:59] then being the Church of God God
[51:01] ordained a certain place for these
[51:02] people to meet in where there would be
[51:04] Fellowship because God longs to
[51:07] fellowship with his people and among his
[51:11] people now Fellowship is
[51:14] companionship it's a company it's
[51:19] one definition as you go down the the
[51:21] list of as you're in the dictionary of
[51:23] what the definition of Fellowship is one
[51:25] of them says it's a company of equals or
[51:31] friends and that one struck out to me a
[51:33] little bit
[51:35] because obviously we don't look at it as
[51:38] well I can have fellowship with God and
[51:40] we're
[51:43] equals
[51:45] no but it's
[51:47] a a company of
[51:49] friends now that we can go
[51:52] with I can be in fellowship with God
[51:57] because God has called me friend God Has
[52:00] Lifted Me Up God has put me in that
[52:02] place to be his friend to have
[52:05] Fellowship back and forth one
[52:07] another yes prise the
[52:11] Lord now we know
[52:15] that Satan hates Fellowship yeah Satan
[52:20] doesn't like it when we're all together
[52:23] Satan doesn't like it when everyone is
[52:25] being friend ly when everyone is getting
[52:27] along when everything is Flowing
[52:30] smoothly Satan doesn't like
[52:33] that 1 Peter chapter
[52:36] 5 at verse 8 says be sober be vigilant
[52:41] because your adversary the devil as a
[52:43] roaring lion walketh about seeking whom
[52:46] he may
[52:47] devour whom resists steadfast in the
[52:49] faith knowing that the same afflictions
[52:51] are accomplished in your brethren that
[52:53] are in the
[52:54] world now we've talked many times and
[52:57] heard many sermons about Satan being a
[52:59] roaring lion brother brandom talks about
[53:01] it many
[53:05] times and this roaring lion if you you
[53:09] know take a little bit of time to look
[53:11] at how Lions hunt you know Lions
[53:15] normally go after while they will
[53:18] occasionally tar small smaller animals
[53:20] if necessary they prefer to get large
[53:24] very meaty animals that travel and
[53:27] hers they normally go after Wier beasts
[53:31] they normally go after I'm trying to
[53:33] remember the the list off the top of my
[53:34] head analou they normally go after these
[53:37] herd
[53:40] animals and so when they go to go
[53:46] after their prey they are normally
[53:49] looking
[53:50] for one that has straighted off by
[53:54] itself or those that are lagging behind
[53:56] that are to the outskirts of the herd
[53:59] they're not trying to pick the prey
[54:01] that's in the very center of this herd
[54:02] of
[54:03] animals you know one of the other ones
[54:05] they go after are buffalo buffalo are
[54:08] big
[54:09] animals they're not going to fight their
[54:11] way through all the other Buffalo to get
[54:12] to the one in the center that's not
[54:16] going to happen but they look for the
[54:18] ones that are on the outskirts they look
[54:20] for the ones that are a little weaker
[54:23] they look for the ones that are sickly
[54:25] they look for the ones that have DEC
[54:26] decided to wander off by themselves
[54:28] because they saw that mouthful of grass
[54:29] after over there and decided that that
[54:31] was worth leaving the group
[54:34] for they look for one that is gotten
[54:37] away from the protection of the group
[54:42] right Satan's always trying to find a
[54:44] way to get us to separate from each
[54:46] other to separate from fellowship for
[54:49] separate from fellowship with our
[54:50] brothers and sisters to separate from
[54:52] fellowship with God because that's when
[54:55] he has his best chances taking a
[54:57] prey while we're in the middle of the
[55:01] pack while we're there with all of our
[55:03] brothers and sisters around us while
[55:05] we're there feeling the the presence of
[55:09] God and and being right there in love
[55:13] with
[55:14] God we're not in much
[55:17] danger we have the protection all around
[55:20] us we are in the middle of the herd
[55:23] we're not the
[55:24] target Satan would love to make you the
[55:26] target but as long as you're in that
[55:28] spot the roaring lion isn't going to
[55:30] come after
[55:32] you there are other weaker options
[55:35] around the edges okay but if you start
[55:38] to stray out if you start to to get to
[55:40] that edge if you start to leave the
[55:43] company leave the
[55:45] group leave the presence of the Lord and
[55:48] get off on your
[55:50] own that is what Satan is looking for
[55:53] That's what Satan is waiting for
[55:57] none of us believe that the different
[56:00] types that are described in the Bible
[56:01] are used lightly I don't think that God
[56:04] when he was having Peter write this had
[56:07] him describe the adversary as a roaring
[56:09] lion just because well it sounds
[56:12] Fierce that's a that's a fierce
[56:14] description that'll work no I think
[56:16] generally when God puts a description in
[56:18] there there's a lot to it he doesn't
[56:22] when we look at creation God doesn't do
[56:24] things in simple ways yeah
[56:27] he likes to be very in
[56:29] depth and so the lion isn't just going
[56:31] well this is the the you know we're
[56:33] depicting that Satan's a very strong
[56:35] adversary and strong very Fierce like
[56:38] well no let's look into some details on
[56:40] what does the lion do how does he take
[56:42] out and he wants you alone he wants you
[56:47] separated he wants you away from the
[56:51] security of the herd of the pack
[56:54] of the family of God he wants you off by
[57:01] yourself in this great servant Moses
[57:04] brother brandom says Moses was back
[57:06] there waiting and now and there he was
[57:08] what did he do he went to work for his
[57:10] father-in-law Jethro and he was hurting
[57:12] his sheep out in the desert place
[57:14] there's a perfect picture here before us
[57:16] tonight of a Believer out of fellowship
[57:18] with God there he was no Fellowship not
[57:22] one thing in that 40 years was spoke
[57:24] that God did for him or any way any
[57:27] Supernatural he was out of fellowship
[57:30] and when the church gets out of
[57:31] fellowship with God Miracles cease signs
[57:34] and wonders cease Revival cease God just
[57:37] moves right out when you get out of
[57:41] Fellowship the thing to do is keep
[57:43] that's what I'm trying to say a while
[57:44] ago the love of God in your heart keep
[57:46] fellowship with him he these things just
[57:48] as don't think so and so Moses out of
[57:51] Fellowship no Fellowship out there in a
[57:52] strange country strangers not own people
[57:55] the people eth and he was a Jew and
[57:58] they're completely out of reach of God
[58:00] seemingly and God all the time knowing
[58:02] that no matter how much of a mess that
[58:05] man makes out of the program of God
[58:07] God's going to straighten it out that's
[58:11] right and in the sermon I will
[58:13] restore he says
[58:19] so not only among the Pentecostal
[58:22] denominations but all denominations this
[58:25] great pal has broken down Brotherhood it
[58:28] did it with the Lutheran it's did it
[58:30] with the Baptists it did it with the
[58:31] Presbyterians it's did it with the
[58:33] nazarin it's did it with the
[58:35] Pentecostals it's always been that old
[58:37] worm in there to make them isolate
[58:39] themselves we got it you ain't got
[58:41] nothing what a
[58:46] Pity now isolate is to set apart from
[58:51] others isolation is basically the
[58:54] opposite of Fellowship
[58:57] to isolate is to go off and to be by
[59:00] yourself and so often that is what the
[59:03] devil is trying to drive us to
[59:06] do and particularly taking a few moments
[59:08] to speak to our front row group here
[59:12] That's what Satan will especially try to
[59:14] do to you as you're going through your
[59:16] teenage years as you were growing up as
[59:18] you were maturing Satan is going to do
[59:21] everything he can to make you feel like
[59:25] you are alone
[59:26] like you are different like you don't
[59:30] deserve to
[59:31] be in this place or in that place
[59:34] because I can't control my emotions I
[59:36] can't handle this I why do I always get
[59:39] frustrated why do I always get upset why
[59:41] am I always blowing up why am I always
[59:43] doing this or doing that I don't even
[59:45] deserve to have friends I should don't
[59:47] even deserve to be at church I don't
[59:48] even deserve God's
[59:50] love take your pick of which statement
[59:52] it
[59:53] is all right but but Satan will do
[59:56] everything he
[59:58] can and once you're past those years it
[1:00:01] doesn't mean you're immune to it but
[1:00:03] those are especially hard years as
[1:00:06] you're going through that time as you
[1:00:08] are maturing as you are growing as you
[1:00:10] are going through all kinds of changes
[1:00:12] in your
[1:00:14] body which are taking you to a great
[1:00:17] place this is what God has designed you
[1:00:19] to do this is what God has designed the
[1:00:21] human body to
[1:00:24] do but it is a Time time when you are
[1:00:27] especially
[1:00:29] sensitive it's a time when you are
[1:00:31] especially susceptible to
[1:00:34] it because all too often there are
[1:00:36] things happening that make it where
[1:00:38] there are certain parts that you can't
[1:00:39] quite control as much as you want
[1:00:43] to as much as you want to go okay I I'm
[1:00:48] not going to get so frustrated this time
[1:00:50] when I'm with my friends I'm going to
[1:00:52] I'm going to be able to I'm going to
[1:00:53] hold it together I'm going to do
[1:00:54] whatever
[1:00:56] and yes you still pray to God for
[1:00:59] self-control but it's going to be a hard
[1:01:01] battle in those
[1:01:02] years you going to go through a
[1:01:05] lot and Satan is going to keep trying to
[1:01:08] make you go off by
[1:01:12] yourself because he wants to isolate you
[1:01:16] he wants to pull you
[1:01:18] away from the friends that they may
[1:01:21] tease you but they're there to support
[1:01:22] you he wants to pull you away from the
[1:01:24] family that is there to love and and
[1:01:26] guide you he wants to pull you away from
[1:01:28] the church that is there to love and
[1:01:29] support you he wants to get you
[1:01:33] isolated because this is the young prey
[1:01:37] that he's going after these are the ones
[1:01:38] that he wants to take
[1:01:42] away God calls us
[1:01:45] to Fellowship God has designed us to
[1:01:48] Crave
[1:01:50] Fellowship but yet we go through those
[1:01:52] times in our lives when we're like I
[1:01:54] just need to be alone
[1:01:58] now
[1:01:59] there's different kinds of being
[1:02:02] alone God calls us to go get alone in
[1:02:05] your prayer closet and spend time with
[1:02:07] him that's a good
[1:02:09] alone if you can be alone with God
[1:02:12] you're not alone you're in a good place
[1:02:16] if you are alone with
[1:02:19] God Devil's not going to do a whole
[1:02:22] lot if you are right there with him but
[1:02:25] when you go on a go off by yourself and
[1:02:27] it's more focused on having a pity party
[1:02:29] it's more focused on beating yourself up
[1:02:32] because man I messed up again or I did
[1:02:34] this or I did
[1:02:36] that Satan's over there just rubbing his
[1:02:39] hands together going all right now I've
[1:02:42] got something to work with now I've got
[1:02:44] a place to go I've
[1:02:46] got someone that I can put some darts in
[1:02:49] I've got someone that I can take a
[1:02:51] strike
[1:02:54] at yeah and and like I said when we get
[1:02:56] to be adults it doesn't mean that we're
[1:02:58] immune from
[1:02:59] this we can no longer blame it on
[1:03:02] hormones going all over the
[1:03:06] place but we can fall into that same
[1:03:09] trap where we go man
[1:03:12] I just don't really want to be around
[1:03:15] anybody I just I don't I don't feel
[1:03:18] connected I don't feel whatever and I'm
[1:03:22] not leaving the church I'm
[1:03:24] just slipping on a little
[1:03:27] bit I'm
[1:03:31] just boy that looks a little bit Greener
[1:03:33] over there maybe I should go check out
[1:03:34] what that's like maybe I should go take
[1:03:37] a taste of this or do this and I'm
[1:03:40] staying in the Border I'm just right
[1:03:42] here at the
[1:03:45] edge Satan is always trying to find the
[1:03:47] way to get us to isolate ourselves
[1:03:51] sure and whether that's because we have
[1:03:54] hurt feelings from something somebody
[1:03:57] said
[1:03:59] that it rubbed me the wrong
[1:04:04] way and 99% of the time they probably
[1:04:08] have zero clue that they said anything
[1:04:11] to hurt you it wasn't their intention
[1:04:14] they weren't trying
[1:04:16] to but they said something that happened
[1:04:19] to connect to a memory or a piece of
[1:04:21] history or something that is in your
[1:04:24] head that got you all riled
[1:04:26] up and it's probably history that had
[1:04:29] nothing to do with them in the first
[1:04:34] place I'm not going to ask for hands but
[1:04:36] I could on how many of us have been
[1:04:38] there and done
[1:04:40] that and then later on you're realizing
[1:04:44] wait they don't know anything about my
[1:04:48] history hey I've only been here in Pon
[1:04:51] for six years y'all don't know about my
[1:04:54] history from when I was a kid unless I
[1:04:57] happen to share it with you so if you
[1:05:00] say something that hurts my feelings
[1:05:01] because of something that happened to me
[1:05:02] as a
[1:05:04] kid how can I blame you for it you don't
[1:05:07] know you have no
[1:05:09] idea but yet so often will allow that to
[1:05:13] start to pry us away
[1:05:16] from friends family church
[1:05:21] family will allow those things start to
[1:05:23] pull us away from fellowship
[1:05:26] and we'll let that little bit that
[1:05:28] little root of bitterness start to pull
[1:05:30] us away from
[1:05:33] God because that that hurt that we think
[1:05:36] is so focused on another human
[1:05:38] being is actually coming between us and
[1:05:42] God because I'm
[1:05:45] allowing that Grudge or that hurt
[1:05:47] feeling towards my brother towards my
[1:05:51] sister to now keep me out of fellowship
[1:05:53] with them
[1:05:58] but if God's in
[1:06:00] them that means my fellowship with God
[1:06:03] is not the place it was
[1:06:08] before it doesn't mean that I'm no
[1:06:11] longer in fellowship with God in some
[1:06:12] way at
[1:06:15] least but there's a fracture there
[1:06:18] there's a break that's come in place
[1:06:20] because I've allowed this old hurt I've
[1:06:22] allowed this old complex I've allow this
[1:06:25] old memory to come
[1:06:30] up and so we're not immune once we get
[1:06:32] past our teenage years as as adults we
[1:06:34] don't suddenly go yes I never have to
[1:06:36] worry about this anymore now the hurt
[1:06:39] feelings still come through they still
[1:06:43] happen but they are especially
[1:06:46] hard for the teenagers because so much
[1:06:50] of it is they don't understand what's
[1:06:52] going on in their body they don't
[1:06:54] understand what's going on in their head
[1:06:57] they don't understand why they're
[1:06:58] thinking these kind of thoughts and
[1:07:00] where in the world this is coming
[1:07:04] from but Satan is trying to isolate he's
[1:07:08] trying to pull us
[1:07:10] apart
[1:07:13] yes and hearing himm in 1957 brother
[1:07:16] random says oh brother when you isolate
[1:07:19] yourself from the rest of the Believers
[1:07:20] God will move away you've got to love
[1:07:23] one another this will all men know that
[1:07:26] you are my disciples when you have love
[1:07:28] one for another when the Methodist and
[1:07:31] the Baptist and the Lutheran and the
[1:07:32] Pentecostal can stand arm in arms and
[1:07:34] March forward you'll see one of the
[1:07:36] mightiest outpourings of the spirit of
[1:07:38] God that you've ever
[1:07:39] seen the devil don't care as long as
[1:07:41] we're shooting at one another oh go
[1:07:43] ahead you just fight kill
[1:07:46] yourselves but let us unite in one big
[1:07:48] front watch what happens then watch what
[1:07:51] goes
[1:07:53] on now I know this quote brother
[1:07:56] brandom's talking about Methodist
[1:07:57] Baptist Lutheran Pentecostal let's just
[1:08:00] throw this one in
[1:08:04] message we can even go more into
[1:08:08] it when new life
[1:08:12] Outreach can stand arm in-
[1:08:16] arm he's not necessarily
[1:08:19] looking Satan is quite happy if we are
[1:08:22] fighting inside he doesn't even need us
[1:08:24] fighting with other message churches
[1:08:26] for just fighting here he's
[1:08:29] good he'll take whichever one he can
[1:08:32] get whichever way that he can drive
[1:08:35] division in whichever way that he can do
[1:08:37] to keep us separated from each other to
[1:08:40] keep us out of Fellowship yeah very
[1:08:47] true brother brandom talks about the
[1:08:49] fact that
[1:08:52] Satan Lucifer was right next to God when
[1:08:56] he was
[1:08:58] there he couldn't
[1:09:00] create but he was right there with
[1:09:05] God and so he knows what God's desires
[1:09:08] are he knows what God yearned for and he
[1:09:11] knows that we being made in God's image
[1:09:16] have those same desires he knows we have
[1:09:19] that desire for
[1:09:20] fellowship and so he wants to tear that
[1:09:23] apart he wants to set us a in a
[1:09:27] society where we can all just be sitting
[1:09:30] at
[1:09:31] home chatting with a person on the other
[1:09:33] side of the
[1:09:34] world and that's all the connection that
[1:09:36] I
[1:09:39] need and we've heard multiple times
[1:09:42] through different sermons as people talk
[1:09:44] about different studies that point out
[1:09:46] that even the world is now realizing
[1:09:48] this is not a good thing they're not
[1:09:51] getting good results from
[1:09:53] this having an a where all of your
[1:09:56] relationships are based on the
[1:09:58] internet is not a positive
[1:10:03] thing but yet Satan continues to move it
[1:10:05] more to go this is what life should be
[1:10:11] like you don't need to be in Fellowship
[1:10:14] you can be good on your own yeah you
[1:10:17] know when you look
[1:10:18] at Hollywood and you look at uh modern
[1:10:23] entertainment
[1:10:26] you'll find this thing that is described
[1:10:29] as the Lone
[1:10:31] Wolf pretty much any action movie that's
[1:10:34] ever been made is about the Lone
[1:10:39] Wolf I'm sure no one here has ever
[1:10:41] watched any of the movies I'm about to
[1:10:42] mention I haven't even watched all of
[1:10:44] them but I'll admit I've watched some of
[1:10:46] them but you've got like Rambo he can
[1:10:48] take on the world all by himself he
[1:10:50] doesn't need anyone to support him
[1:10:52] you've got uh
[1:10:55] Chuck Norris in any of the movies that
[1:10:57] he was in one man Wrecking Crew can take
[1:10:59] on anybody he's all on his
[1:11:02] own and you go
[1:11:04] through movie after movie or book after
[1:11:09] book and it's rare that you find one
[1:11:13] that it's about the team working
[1:11:17] together it's rare that it's about this
[1:11:21] group that is able to accomplish
[1:11:22] something it's more often presented as
[1:11:26] this is the hero who can do everything
[1:11:30] by himself it's up to him to save it and
[1:11:33] then he walks away from the town that he
[1:11:35] saved to find the next problem he has to
[1:11:39] fix and we have at a society where
[1:11:42] people begin to look at that as man
[1:11:44] that's that's what I want to be I want
[1:11:46] to be the lone wolf that can take on
[1:11:48] anything I want to be the L lone wolf
[1:11:50] that can face any enemy come out on top
[1:11:53] and then go to find the next problem
[1:12:01] yeah but even the very term Lone
[1:12:05] Wolf doesn't actually make a lot of
[1:12:08] sense wolves by Nature are pack animals
[1:12:11] if you start to look into it a lone wolf
[1:12:15] normally doesn't survive very long
[1:12:17] normally the only reason it's a lone
[1:12:18] wolf is because have been kicked out of
[1:12:19] the pack it's either too old or too weak
[1:12:23] to contribute all right and so it is
[1:12:26] struggling to survive on its own and it
[1:12:31] normally doesn't last that
[1:12:33] long but yet somehow we live in a
[1:12:35] society where now we've changed it to
[1:12:37] the idea of a lone
[1:12:40] wolf means that you're something
[1:12:44] special where if you actually look at it
[1:12:46] in nature a lone wolf is probably
[1:12:49] someone that's going to die in that long
[1:12:51] because they've left the pack they're
[1:12:53] not with the support and the security
[1:12:56] that they're supposed to
[1:12:59] have we have a lot of those kind of
[1:13:01] terms as you go through the English
[1:13:02] language I'm sure most most people here
[1:13:05] have heard the term uh pull yourself up
[1:13:07] by your own
[1:13:09] bootstraps yeah so that is a term that
[1:13:15] changed first off let's lay this out
[1:13:18] real clearly it is physically impossible
[1:13:20] for you to pick yourself up by your own
[1:13:23] bootstraps lay on the ground and then
[1:13:24] pick pick at your bootstraps and see if
[1:13:26] you can get yourself up it doesn't
[1:13:29] work and originally that's what the term
[1:13:33] meant if you study the language back a
[1:13:36] little bit trying to pick yourself up by
[1:13:39] your own bootstraps was to say you
[1:13:41] cannot do this it was to say that this
[1:13:45] is an impossibility it was to say that
[1:13:47] this is something that you are going to
[1:13:48] fail
[1:13:50] at but somewhere through the course of
[1:13:53] time it changed to be man I am just that
[1:13:55] good I can pick myself up by my own
[1:13:58] bootstraps and keep on going I don't
[1:14:00] need any help I can do it all by
[1:14:06] myself kind of fits that Lone Wolf
[1:14:08] mentality that you think I can do it all
[1:14:13] alone I can go out there and I can take
[1:14:16] on the world with no
[1:14:19] support and come out on
[1:14:22] top it's the kind of world that
[1:14:25] Satan wants us to be in it's the kind of
[1:14:28] world that Satan wants us to give into
[1:14:32] he wants us to give into that mindset
[1:14:34] that man I can I can do that I can take
[1:14:38] on the enemy I can handle whatever the
[1:14:40] problem is all by myself I don't need
[1:14:44] help I don't need
[1:14:46] support if I make a mistake I'll figure
[1:14:48] out how to get out of the mess I'll do
[1:14:51] this I'll do that
[1:14:57] and we give ourselves those type of the
[1:14:59] world gives itself those kind of
[1:15:01] descriptions like the Lone Wolf so they
[1:15:03] feel Fierce and powerful and strong
[1:15:07] instead of realizing maybe you're just a
[1:15:10] prey that has wanded too far away from
[1:15:12] the
[1:15:13] herd because there's still that roaring
[1:15:15] lion out
[1:15:16] there because the scripture doesn't
[1:15:18] describe the one person going off by
[1:15:21] themselves as the roaring
[1:15:22] lion the scriptures describe Satan is
[1:15:25] the roaring lion he's the one that's
[1:15:27] coming after us he's the one that's
[1:15:29] trying to get us isolated that trying to
[1:15:32] get us away from
[1:15:39] everyone amus 3 and verse3 says can two
[1:15:42] walk together except they be
[1:15:48] agreed in 1957 why some people can't
[1:15:51] keep the victory brother brandom says I
[1:15:53] believe the Pentecostal Church has got
[1:15:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe
[1:15:57] the rest of you do too that claim it I
[1:15:59] believe your speaking in tongues is
[1:16:00] right I believe that your prophecies are
[1:16:02] right being a Baptist I believe it sure
[1:16:05] I do but there's one thing brother it's
[1:16:06] not keeping the right kind of time
[1:16:08] that's what I'm trying to say so it
[1:16:10] takes the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:16:11] come into the human heart there to make
[1:16:13] the thing run right the love of God God
[1:16:17] is love and unless each one of these
[1:16:19] gifts is put right in the center of Love
[1:16:22] it'll become selfish and indifferent
[1:16:24] pull itself off off and isolate itself
[1:16:27] and cross over and fuss and stew but
[1:16:30] when it's anchored right in the middle
[1:16:31] of Love it'll Fellowship everywhere and
[1:16:34] that's right that's exactly what we need
[1:16:36] the church is dying for love
[1:16:42] brother in fellowshipping with God
[1:16:44] through reconciliation brother random
[1:16:46] says Fellowship God wanting to
[1:16:48] fellowship with man always wanted to do
[1:16:50] it the Old Testament all of it was full
[1:16:53] of the shed blood
[1:16:55] without the shedding of blood there's no
[1:16:57] remission of sin and when there's no
[1:16:58] remission of sin there's no
[1:17:00] Fellowship you've got to get away from
[1:17:02] sin before you can ever have fellowship
[1:17:04] with God because God can't fellowship
[1:17:06] with sin so you're born to sinner shaped
[1:17:09] in iniquity come to the world speaking
[1:17:11] lies and how can you ever do it you just
[1:17:14] might as well quit right now to begin
[1:17:15] with you can't do it within yourself but
[1:17:18] there is one who died to bring you to
[1:17:20] Fellowship back not only to Fellowship
[1:17:23] but relationship with God to make you
[1:17:25] Sons and Daughters of God died for that
[1:17:28] purpose come here proved himself Emanuel
[1:17:31] omnipotent and when an omnipotent speaks
[1:17:34] the miraculous
[1:17:41] happens Satan spends his time wanting to
[1:17:45] break those yolks of Fellowship wanting
[1:17:46] to break the bonds of Fellowship that
[1:17:49] keep us
[1:17:51] together when we talk about
[1:17:56] the church being a mighty
[1:17:59] Army the Army works as
[1:18:03] groups even when you go into looking
[1:18:06] at a group like the
[1:18:09] seals the seals are trained to work
[1:18:12] together in a coordinated fashion there
[1:18:14] even though they might be the mightiest
[1:18:16] Warriors that anyone can think of or
[1:18:18] name they're not trained to go off on
[1:18:20] one by
[1:18:22] one they are trained to work together to
[1:18:25] accomplish the objective they are
[1:18:26] trained to know that I'm doing this and
[1:18:29] I know that that guy's watching my
[1:18:32] back and we know when we go after the
[1:18:35] next objective he knows he can go for it
[1:18:37] because I'm watching his back and I'm
[1:18:40] going to make sure no one gets him
[1:18:42] they're not trained to be onean wrecking
[1:18:45] Crews or any of these kind of things
[1:18:46] that Hollywood likes to depict they are
[1:18:48] trained to work together to accomplish
[1:18:51] their objective and they are trained to
[1:18:52] protect one another to accomplish their
[1:19:01] objective even when you go through and
[1:19:03] you look
[1:19:08] at you when you go in and you look at
[1:19:10] David's Mighty
[1:19:12] Men you have standing above all of them
[1:19:16] you have the
[1:19:17] three that stand
[1:19:19] out and they each one have something
[1:19:23] where it talks about them doing this one
[1:19:25] thing on their own to accomplish this
[1:19:28] great
[1:19:30] task but as you also read through
[1:19:33] history and commentaries and things you
[1:19:36] find out that often the three actually
[1:19:38] fought
[1:19:39] together that's one of the reasons they
[1:19:41] were called the
[1:19:42] three now they would be sent separately
[1:19:45] sometimes obviously these were great
[1:19:48] warriors of David he would use
[1:19:52] them but often they were
[1:19:56] together you weren't normally he
[1:19:59] wasn't David wasn't sending one man to
[1:20:02] take out 800 or 500 or however
[1:20:06] many if God allowed that to happen
[1:20:08] wonderful but that wasn't what they
[1:20:10] planned their battle strategy
[1:20:13] around you didn't go into it thinking
[1:20:16] this one person is going to take on the
[1:20:17] whole Army by
[1:20:19] themselves right and even then they
[1:20:23] didn't do it by themselves
[1:20:26] they had god with
[1:20:28] them this
[1:20:30] wasn't one amazing Warrior that could do
[1:20:33] it all on their own this was one man
[1:20:36] strengthened by God to do the
[1:20:44] battle Satan wants us to be on our loan
[1:20:47] Satan wants us to feel alone Satan wants
[1:20:51] us
[1:20:53] to think that we can handle it alone
[1:20:56] yeah Satan will take different routes on
[1:20:59] how we want to do it he may want he may
[1:21:01] want to drive you to be alone and feel
[1:21:04] so helpless like you can't do
[1:21:07] it but at the same time he'll take you
[1:21:10] if you if you want to go off and be like
[1:21:12] man I'm that good I can do it alone
[1:21:14] he'll work with that
[1:21:16] too he is quite
[1:21:19] happy to go after you if you think
[1:21:21] you're that
[1:21:22] stuff if you think that you're that
[1:21:24] strong he will be glad to face you
[1:21:26] oneon-one
[1:21:28] as long as the one-on-one means you're
[1:21:30] not bringing god with
[1:21:34] you Satan is always out to
[1:21:40] isolate and he'll use whatever method he
[1:21:44] can from the hormones in a teenager to
[1:21:47] the hurt feelings of an
[1:21:48] adult he'll use whatever he can to use
[1:21:52] that wedge to drive you apart
[1:21:55] to take you
[1:21:58] away from those that you need to have
[1:22:01] with
[1:22:06] you in the sermon Fellowship in
[1:22:10] 1960 brother brandom says now God wanted
[1:22:13] fellowship and if we no matter if man
[1:22:16] today is a fallen Son of God there are
[1:22:19] some parts of God still with that man in
[1:22:21] his Fallen State you take a man today
[1:22:23] that can split atom or molecule or
[1:22:25] whatever you want to call it and can
[1:22:26] drive a jet plane around the world in a
[1:22:28] few hours and you can see that he is
[1:22:31] something in him is a fallen creation
[1:22:34] now he cannot create anything but he can
[1:22:36] pervert what has been created into
[1:22:38] something to better himself and that
[1:22:40] shows that man never come from an animal
[1:22:42] life because animal continually builds
[1:22:44] the same habitation to live in but man
[1:22:47] makes him a better house a better way of
[1:22:49] living better clothes better
[1:22:52] transportation now all of that shows
[1:22:53] something behind find it even in his
[1:22:56] Fallen State he's still a Son of God
[1:23:00] fallen and then when he wants
[1:23:02] fellowship and when we want courtship
[1:23:05] and things like that it has to come upon
[1:23:06] a basis of an agreement now when God
[1:23:09] made man in the beginning to fellowship
[1:23:11] with him then this man was in perfect
[1:23:13] Fellowship in the garden of Edom he was
[1:23:15] in perfect fellowship with God and how
[1:23:17] it must have been on that day when God
[1:23:19] would come down in the cool of the
[1:23:20] evening and call Adam and he and Eve
[1:23:23] would come up and they would worship God
[1:23:24] and they would fellowship and commune
[1:23:27] one with
[1:23:32] another 1965 Satan's
[1:23:35] Eden and so God knew that we would be
[1:23:38] here but then he puts us in flesh so we
[1:23:42] would be contacted in order he could
[1:23:44] contact he became one of us when he
[1:23:45] became Jesus Christ the son of God
[1:23:48] himself the fullness of the
[1:23:49] manifestation of God therefore that was
[1:23:52] God's purpose to display his attributes
[1:23:54] in
[1:23:55] Fellowship when I was in my father I
[1:23:57] knew nothing about it but when I became
[1:23:59] his son and was born of him I was an
[1:24:01] attribute a part of my father and you're
[1:24:03] a part of your father and as children of
[1:24:06] God we are part of God's attribute that
[1:24:08] was in him made flesh like he was made
[1:24:10] flesh so that we can have Fellowship one
[1:24:12] with the other as a family of God upon
[1:24:15] the Earth and that was God's purpose at
[1:24:17] the beginning yes sir that's what God
[1:24:19] wanted at the beginning
[1:24:22] right and we know that Satan is out
[1:24:25] to strike down everything that God made
[1:24:29] to pervert it to change it to make it
[1:24:32] into his
[1:24:35] kingdom he wants to pervert whatever is
[1:24:37] there and so he doesn't
[1:24:39] want us to have that desire for
[1:24:42] Fellowship he doesn't want us to be able
[1:24:43] to achieve that desire for Fellowship he
[1:24:46] doesn't want us to be able to satisfy
[1:24:49] that because he wants us to be filling
[1:24:52] that and satisfying ourselves in a
[1:24:55] different
[1:24:56] way he wants us to satisfy ourselves
[1:25:00] with the different types of
[1:25:02] relationships that the world
[1:25:04] give the different types of
[1:25:07] relationships that make them feel like
[1:25:10] they're connected in some way without
[1:25:13] there actually being that True
[1:25:15] Fellowship you know when you've got
[1:25:17] somebody that you're having real
[1:25:20] fellowship with that you are really in
[1:25:23] that kind kind of connection
[1:25:25] to You can
[1:25:31] disagree and you may
[1:25:34] disagree
[1:25:36] heatedly you may be both passionate
[1:25:39] about what you're disagreeing
[1:25:42] about but you'll still be able to get
[1:25:45] together the next
[1:25:48] day and visit some more and spend more
[1:25:51] time
[1:25:53] together you'll be able to still connect
[1:25:57] because you have more in
[1:26:00] common than whatever this thing that
[1:26:03] you're disagreeing about
[1:26:07] is and you know what this may be a topic
[1:26:10] that you talk about a
[1:26:13] lot you know we'll keep it light for a
[1:26:15] minute there are plenty of people that
[1:26:17] vehemently disagree about
[1:26:20] football you know there are OSU fans
[1:26:22] there are ou fans
[1:26:25] and they can
[1:26:27] Fellowship they may have some heated
[1:26:30] discussions about
[1:26:33] football but they can still Fellowship
[1:26:35] about other
[1:26:37] things they can actually Fellowship
[1:26:39] about the OSU you and which team's
[1:26:41] better and who who came out on top this
[1:26:43] year this that or the
[1:26:46] other and you can do the same thing with
[1:26:48] all kinds of sports and all kinds of
[1:26:50] topics going on well you know my team's
[1:26:52] the better one this year and why are you
[1:26:54] still supporting that team and you know
[1:26:57] all this kind of stuff you go back and
[1:26:58] forth
[1:27:00] on but yet they'll still get together
[1:27:02] and talk
[1:27:03] about hunting
[1:27:06] or golf or work or family stuff
[1:27:12] or church stuff
[1:27:15] or whatever it might
[1:27:17] be but when you have somebody that you
[1:27:19] can really fellowship with the
[1:27:23] disagreement doesn't make go I'm never
[1:27:24] going to talk to them
[1:27:26] again the disagreement doesn't make you
[1:27:28] go okay I'm cutting them off of my
[1:27:30] friend
[1:27:33] list or in this Modern Age I am
[1:27:35] unfriending you I don't even want to see
[1:27:37] what you post anymore we are done we are
[1:27:44] separated normally friends have
[1:27:50] disagreements and normally that's one of
[1:27:52] the things like if you have that really
[1:27:54] good friend if you're able to have that
[1:27:56] really good fellowship with somebody is
[1:27:58] one of the few people in the world that
[1:27:59] you will trust to tell you what you
[1:28:01] don't want to
[1:28:04] hear doesn't mean you like hearing it
[1:28:07] but that's the person that you will
[1:28:09] trust to tell you what you really don't
[1:28:12] want to
[1:28:15] hear and
[1:28:18] that's the kind of relationship we're
[1:28:20] supposed to have with
[1:28:21] God we're supposed to have
[1:28:25] such fellowship with God that when he
[1:28:27] comes
[1:28:28] down and he looks at you and he goes
[1:28:32] brother
[1:28:33] Merl you need to work on this area in
[1:28:35] your
[1:28:37] life and brother Merl is sitting there
[1:28:39] going man we've just had some wonderful
[1:28:42] weeks it's been great Services I've been
[1:28:45] in the presence of God I felt so close
[1:28:47] and now God's telling me I got to work
[1:28:49] on
[1:28:50] this I thought we were in a good spot
[1:28:57] but
[1:28:57] if if brother Merl truly has that kind
[1:29:01] of love and that kind of fellowship with
[1:29:03] God he's not going to like hearing
[1:29:06] it but he's going to be willing to
[1:29:08] accept
[1:29:09] it it's not going to drive him off make
[1:29:12] go you know what I'm gonna skip church
[1:29:14] this
[1:29:15] week I'm gonna go do this instead or ah
[1:29:18] I got a cough I I think I'm going to
[1:29:20] stay
[1:29:22] home whichever it might be he's because
[1:29:26] the
[1:29:27] relationship the fellowship is more
[1:29:32] important and that relationship has
[1:29:35] pointed out an area of his life that
[1:29:37] needs to be
[1:29:41] addressed that's the kind of
[1:29:43] relationship that we should have with
[1:29:45] our
[1:29:46] spouses yeah I will be the first one to
[1:29:50] say I hate it when my wife points out
[1:29:54] something in my life that I need to work
[1:29:58] on I don't want to hear
[1:30:00] it I want her to be telling me how great
[1:30:03] I am and how wonderful I am how you know
[1:30:06] boy you are an amazing husband you're a
[1:30:09] wonderful father all those kinds of
[1:30:11] things that's what I want to
[1:30:14] hear but if there's one person in my
[1:30:16] life that can see my
[1:30:20] flaws it's going to be the one that's
[1:30:22] closest to me
[1:30:25] and if I love
[1:30:27] her and I have fellowship with her and I
[1:30:30] have a good relationship with
[1:30:34] her I need to be able to take
[1:30:37] that and I need to know that she's
[1:30:40] speaking it out of love she's not
[1:30:43] looking at me going you know I don't
[1:30:46] like that he does that I just want him
[1:30:49] to be more the way I think he should be
[1:30:51] and so I'm going to tell him this needs
[1:30:52] to change
[1:30:54] if she's pointing out something I need
[1:30:56] to be trusting that she's pointing out
[1:30:57] something going I don't think God likes
[1:31:00] that in your
[1:31:01] life I think that maybe this needs to
[1:31:05] change to better our family or to better
[1:31:09] your relationship with
[1:31:11] God and that should work vice versa this
[1:31:15] isn't just the wives talking to the
[1:31:19] husbands and I guarantee my wife doesn't
[1:31:22] like it if I try to point out something
[1:31:23] to her either
[1:31:25] because guess what we're both human
[1:31:28] beings and human beings don't like
[1:31:33] correction we're not happy with it we
[1:31:36] don't enjoy
[1:31:39] it but when there's that
[1:31:43] relationship you know The Human Side may
[1:31:46] rise up just a little bit at that first
[1:31:47] moment going how dare she be telling
[1:31:51] me that I need to fix this or do that
[1:31:56] there's still this this flesh man that
[1:31:58] that causes
[1:32:02] problems but I should be able to take
[1:32:04] that from her
[1:32:06] because I'm in that kind of relationship
[1:32:08] I'm in that kind of fellowship with her
[1:32:11] okay now not just anyone can walk up to
[1:32:14] me and say hey you need to work on this
[1:32:15] in your life if I don't have a
[1:32:17] relationship with you why in the world
[1:32:19] am I going to listen to
[1:32:20] you why in the world am I going to trust
[1:32:22] what you have to say
[1:32:24] that's
[1:32:27] right but it's the same thing we get
[1:32:31] from
[1:32:33] God and sometimes that comes
[1:32:36] from I'm GNA hide down here sometimes it
[1:32:40] comes from the guy behind the
[1:32:43] pulpit sometimes pastor's up here and
[1:32:45] he's he's preaching away and
[1:32:48] he is delivering what God is telling him
[1:32:52] to say yeah
[1:32:55] and he's stomping all over
[1:32:57] you or he's stomping all over
[1:33:01] me I can't sit there and go brother
[1:33:04] Wendell has no right to be telling me
[1:33:09] that or we'll take brother W out of it
[1:33:12] whatever visiting Minister happens to be
[1:33:14] here that we don't have a relationship
[1:33:17] with it's somebody brother Wendell
[1:33:19] invited this guy in I don't know him I
[1:33:22] know nothing about him
[1:33:24] and how dare he be in my
[1:33:31] business but if I am in fellowship with
[1:33:34] God and if I have a relationship with
[1:33:37] God then I should be able to take that
[1:33:42] correction and yes I may the flesh man
[1:33:45] may rise up just a little bit while I'm
[1:33:46] sitting back there it may not want to
[1:33:49] take it it may not be happy about taking
[1:33:52] it
[1:33:54] but if there's that relationship there
[1:33:55] if I am still in communication with my
[1:34:00] Creator all
[1:34:02] right now if I'm not in communication
[1:34:04] with my Creator if I haven't been
[1:34:08] fellowshipping with him if I haven't
[1:34:10] been praying if I haven't been reading
[1:34:12] his word and listening to the
[1:34:14] prophet it's be pretty easy to
[1:34:18] ignore what's being said yes it's be
[1:34:22] very easy for me to start to isolate
[1:34:24] myself even
[1:34:27] more because there's no relationship to
[1:34:30] support this what's coming out to me and
[1:34:32] so now I've got hurt feelings that want
[1:34:34] to drive me off even
[1:34:41] further Satan will use anything he
[1:34:44] can he'll use your brothers and sisters
[1:34:48] around you to say something he'll use
[1:34:50] situations in your life that make you
[1:34:53] hey I had to work I had I had to work
[1:34:56] longer hours this week than
[1:34:58] normal I've got stresses from these
[1:35:00] bills or from this sickness or from this
[1:35:03] situation going
[1:35:06] on and I'm just tired I'm worn out I'm
[1:35:12] crabby and I've been so busy I haven't
[1:35:16] prayed like I should I've been so busy
[1:35:18] that I haven't been able to do my
[1:35:20] devotion time the way I should I've been
[1:35:21] so busy with this that of the
[1:35:26] other and it's like that herd of buffalo
[1:35:29] where that that weak or sickly starts to
[1:35:32] wander towards the
[1:35:34] side and it becomes the target for the
[1:35:39] lion all right because now it's getting
[1:35:41] off on its own it's not staying with the
[1:35:47] herd Ephesians chapter 2 and verse
[1:35:51] 6 and hath raised us up together and
[1:35:54] made us sit together in Heavenly places
[1:35:57] in Christ
[1:36:00] Jesus Ecclesiastes chapter
[1:36:03] 4 starting at verse 9 two are better
[1:36:06] than one because they have a good reward
[1:36:08] for their labor for if they fall the one
[1:36:11] will lift up his fellow but woe to him
[1:36:14] that is alone when he falleth for he
[1:36:16] hath not another to help him up again if
[1:36:19] two lie together then they have heat but
[1:36:21] how can one be warm alone
[1:36:24] and if one Prevail against him two shall
[1:36:26] withstand him and a three-fold cord is
[1:36:29] not quickly
[1:36:37] broken Hebrews chapter
[1:36:39] 10 and verse
[1:36:42] 24 and let us consider one another to
[1:36:45] provoke unto love and to Good Works not
[1:36:48] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:36:50] together as the manner of some but
[1:36:52] exhorting one another and so much the
[1:36:55] more as you see the day
[1:36:58] approaching in another translation it
[1:37:01] says it is and let us consider one
[1:37:03] another to provoke unto love and to Good
[1:37:06] Works not neglecting to meet together as
[1:37:09] is the habit of some but encouraging one
[1:37:11] another and all the more as you see the
[1:37:14] day Drawing
[1:37:21] Near we live in a world where
[1:37:24] people just keep getting more and more
[1:37:27] disconnected sister fresa posted
[1:37:29] something on the chat just the other day
[1:37:31] that talk one of the things that listed
[1:37:32] was the fact that you go back however
[1:37:34] many years and everybody knew their
[1:37:36] neighbor and now you live next to
[1:37:40] strangers we live in an age in a world
[1:37:43] where that's kind of the standard now is
[1:37:47] I don't know who lives next to me I
[1:37:49] don't know who else is in the
[1:37:51] neighborhood I don't know the parents
[1:37:54] of my kids'
[1:37:55] friends I don't know this that or the
[1:38:02] other and we get so isolated and so on
[1:38:06] our own and even in the church it's so
[1:38:08] easy for that Spirit to start to get on
[1:38:13] us to go hey it's not that
[1:38:17] important for me to get
[1:38:20] together hey I'm at service
[1:38:24] I'm at every
[1:38:25] service why do I need to go to the
[1:38:28] fellowships or why do I need to get
[1:38:30] together when the church is doing this
[1:38:31] or doing
[1:38:33] that now I'll be the first one to
[1:38:36] say I can't make it to every single
[1:38:38] birthday party we got way too many
[1:38:40] birthdays In This
[1:38:42] Crowd okay that's not going to work
[1:38:46] can't make it to every single one and I
[1:38:48] think most of us will probably say the
[1:38:50] same thing I can't make every single one
[1:38:54] but we can still try to get
[1:38:56] together and
[1:38:58] this just in the years I've been here
[1:39:00] I've always been so impressed at how
[1:39:02] good this church is with
[1:39:03] that but it's so easy for us to start
[1:39:06] getting wrapped up in whatever is going
[1:39:10] on and start to go well you know that's
[1:39:12] not that
[1:39:14] important it's not that big a
[1:39:17] deal you know getting together for lunch
[1:39:20] between services
[1:39:24] I will be the first one to say that can
[1:39:26] be a real hassle
[1:39:28] sometimes and I know all those that are
[1:39:30] driving from someplace other than paon e
[1:39:33] it can be a hassle to bring the food and
[1:39:35] get everything ready when you're having
[1:39:36] to transport it that far and if I forgot
[1:39:39] something I can't just run back to my
[1:39:41] house real
[1:39:43] quick can I get an amen from Sister
[1:39:47] Karen from those that travel a little
[1:39:50] bit it's not always the easiest thing to
[1:39:55] do and there are times where I enjoy
[1:39:58] that we're not meeting and I go back to
[1:40:00] still water and eat and go to my house
[1:40:02] and I relax there for a short time and
[1:40:05] then come back to
[1:40:06] church I enjoy that now and then once
[1:40:10] every six weeks or whatever it is we do
[1:40:14] but at the same
[1:40:17] time we're supposed to be staying in
[1:40:19] Fellowship we're supposed to be staying
[1:40:21] together which means that I should be
[1:40:24] working towards the goal of I'm going to
[1:40:26] do my best to be
[1:40:28] there sure there going to be times I
[1:40:30] can't make it there are going to be
[1:40:32] times things are going
[1:40:35] on I even have it on occasion where my
[1:40:39] job has the occasional meeting on a
[1:40:40] Sunday afternoon if that happens I'm
[1:40:43] probably not going to be at lunch so I'm
[1:40:45] going to head to Still Water to do my
[1:40:46] meeting and then come
[1:40:49] back things are going to happen where we
[1:40:51] can't make every single one things are
[1:40:53] going to happen where we can't make
[1:40:54] every single birthday or we can't make
[1:40:56] every single fellowship or we can't make
[1:40:58] every single whatever it might
[1:41:01] be and that's
[1:41:04] life God didn't put in the scripture
[1:41:07] that we're supposed to be at every
[1:41:09] single event that the church
[1:41:14] has but we are still supposed to have
[1:41:17] this desire and this longing for
[1:41:20] fellowship and that's
[1:41:23] connecting with my brothers and sisters
[1:41:25] and if that
[1:41:26] means that I'm figuring out how to get
[1:41:30] food from Missouri to Pon
[1:41:33] e that's what's going to happen if it's
[1:41:37] we're figuring out how to get food from
[1:41:38] still water which is not nearly as far
[1:41:39] as Missouri
[1:41:41] tupon we're going to figure out and
[1:41:43] we're going to make it
[1:41:45] happen I'm not always going to be happy
[1:41:47] about it I'm not always
[1:41:50] gonna think it was easy
[1:41:55] but yet you're going to have that desire
[1:41:57] to go I want to
[1:41:59] be there in Fellowship I want to be with
[1:42:03] my brothers and sisters I want to be
[1:42:05] around
[1:42:06] them no I can't make every single
[1:42:09] birthday but I can sure come to a decent
[1:42:12] amount of them and be there to be with
[1:42:15] my brothers and sisters to
[1:42:18] be in fellowship with
[1:42:20] them all right
[1:42:24] Satan wants to push us apart Satan wants
[1:42:27] to use everything he can to make us feel
[1:42:29] like we're isolated like we're
[1:42:33] separated and yes I'm going to pick on
[1:42:35] sister Karen some more it's probably
[1:42:37] easier to make sister Karen and brother
[1:42:40] Steve feel isolated all the way in
[1:42:42] Missouri than it is to make brother
[1:42:45] Caleb feel isolated living across the
[1:42:48] street or just down the street from who
[1:42:50] knows how many people in the church yeah
[1:42:54] there is a physical distance that
[1:42:57] affects
[1:43:01] it but there is still a fellowship that
[1:43:06] happens when we get together and we're
[1:43:09] able
[1:43:11] to share our little licks of fire
[1:43:14] together and we're able to talk
[1:43:17] about the good things of the Lord and
[1:43:20] talk about what's been happening in Life
[1:43:22] or talk about what's going
[1:43:25] on and our goal is obviously if I come
[1:43:28] in and I'm talking about life I'm hoping
[1:43:31] there's a brother or sister that can
[1:43:32] encourage a little
[1:43:34] bit if I'm talking about the stresses
[1:43:37] that are going on at my job or whatever
[1:43:39] it
[1:43:39] is hopefully there's a brother or sister
[1:43:42] that instead of just going man you've
[1:43:44] got a bad
[1:43:46] job hopefully there be somebody that
[1:43:48] goes you know what God's using you where
[1:43:51] you're at
[1:43:54] God's giving you a testimony through
[1:43:55] this situation God's doing this or doing
[1:44:03] that God calls us and God has given us
[1:44:06] this desire for Fellowship because it's
[1:44:09] the very desire he
[1:44:12] has God has the desire to be in
[1:44:15] fellowship with
[1:44:17] us he created man for the purpose of
[1:44:21] fellowship and then he chose to come
[1:44:23] down and clothe himself in human
[1:44:28] flesh because we had lost that
[1:44:31] fellowship and there was no way we could
[1:44:33] get back to
[1:44:35] him and God's desire for Fellowship was
[1:44:38] so strong that he was like I will pay
[1:44:40] the price
[1:44:42] myself I will create a body I will dwell
[1:44:44] in it I will come down I will
[1:44:48] die so that I can have fellowship with
[1:44:51] you again
[1:44:59] God's desire for Fellowship is that
[1:45:01] strong that not only would he create us
[1:45:04] to begin
[1:45:06] with but that he would then pay the
[1:45:11] price after sin had come in to spoil it
[1:45:15] he would pay the price to redeem us and
[1:45:17] bring us
[1:45:19] back so that we could once again have
[1:45:22] that Fellowship
[1:45:24] so that we could be in service and we
[1:45:25] could feel his presence among us and we
[1:45:28] could have those moments Weeping at the
[1:45:31] altar or those moments when we're just
[1:45:33] standing there praising
[1:45:35] God or those moments in our closet when
[1:45:38] we're all by ourselves and God comes in
[1:45:40] and is talking to
[1:45:42] us are those moments when God visits us
[1:45:45] on the job side or in the grocery store
[1:45:48] whatever it might be and
[1:45:50] just God drops down and just gives you
[1:45:52] that little to remind you hey I'm
[1:45:56] here and I want to spend time with
[1:46:02] you Satan wants to isolate Satan wants
[1:46:06] to separate us Satan wants to drive us
[1:46:09] apart Satan wants to do everything he
[1:46:15] can and part of us wants to look at and
[1:46:18] go well as long as I'm still connecting
[1:46:21] to God if I get sep separated from the
[1:46:24] people it's okay cuz that's people this
[1:46:27] is God as long as I'm here we're
[1:46:31] good but then we remind ourselves and we
[1:46:34] have to remember that God is in his
[1:46:39] people and so those people that I'm
[1:46:41] allowing wedges to come in
[1:46:43] between that's God
[1:46:46] there you know if I'm standing up here
[1:46:49] and I have an issue with brother Colby
[1:46:50] and so I'm avoiding him and I'm staying
[1:46:53] away from
[1:46:54] him I am also separating myself from the
[1:46:57] gifts that God has placed in that man I
[1:47:00] am also separating from the things that
[1:47:03] God could be using him to minister to
[1:47:06] some part of my life in right you know
[1:47:09] it's easy to pick on the ones that get
[1:47:11] up on this platform in some way if I
[1:47:14] have an issue with brother Colby or with
[1:47:15] brother Merl I'm probably not going to
[1:47:17] enter into the worship the same
[1:47:19] way because every time I look at them
[1:47:21] I'm going to think about
[1:47:23] whatever the issue is or whatever the
[1:47:24] problem
[1:47:27] is but it's no less real if it's a
[1:47:31] brother or sister that
[1:47:33] doesn't do anything in
[1:47:38] public you know Sister Carol in the
[1:47:42] back I don't really know how you have a
[1:47:44] problem with sister Carol but that's
[1:47:47] between you and God
[1:47:49] but you know if I've got a problem with
[1:47:51] sister Carol
[1:47:54] maybe it's not going to affect me the
[1:47:56] entire worship
[1:48:00] service but if I happen to glance over
[1:48:02] and I see she's got her hand up and
[1:48:04] she's entering in then suddenly I going
[1:48:07] what a hypocrite how could she do that
[1:48:09] when she said this about me and you
[1:48:12] whatever whatever it might
[1:48:15] be and now suddenly whatever I was
[1:48:18] getting out of the service just got
[1:48:20] thrown out because I got wrapped up
[1:48:23] into my hurt or my
[1:48:27] problems all right there's a reason that
[1:48:30] when we come to
[1:48:33] communion that we are supposed to be
[1:48:35] examining
[1:48:37] ourselves and that we are told if you
[1:48:40] have a problem with your brother or
[1:48:42] sister go make it
[1:48:44] right don't come up and take
[1:48:49] this if you still have odd in your heart
[1:48:51] against
[1:48:53] a brother or sister or you still have
[1:48:55] unconfessed sin against a brother or
[1:48:57] sister you still
[1:48:59] have this or
[1:49:03] that God doesn't take Fellowship lightly
[1:49:07] he doesn't take this
[1:49:10] as this is a once a year coffee meeting
[1:49:12] or this is a once a year
[1:49:15] whatever to God
[1:49:17] Fellowship is the very purpose
[1:49:24] behind
[1:49:28] creation Fellowship is why he made man
[1:49:31] because he desired
[1:49:33] Fellowship he created more than one
[1:49:36] because he knew that they desired
[1:49:38] Fellowship he could have just left it as
[1:49:42] Adam and if he had done that it would
[1:49:44] still just be Adam and him that's that's
[1:49:49] it but God knew Adam has that same
[1:49:53] desire he needs Fellowship as well so he
[1:49:56] needs his
[1:49:59] partner and each one of us is the same
[1:50:01] way we're not designed to be on our own
[1:50:04] we're not designed to be the Lone Wolf
[1:50:07] or to do this or do that God has
[1:50:10] designed us to have fellowship with our
[1:50:12] brothers and sisters God has designed us
[1:50:14] to have fellowship with
[1:50:17] him we can't think that we can handle it
[1:50:20] all on our own we can't think
[1:50:23] that we're
[1:50:28] okay and I know that is
[1:50:31] probably hardest for all us guys because
[1:50:34] we want to handle it on our own we want
[1:50:36] to be the big strong guy that I can
[1:50:38] handle my own problems I don't need to
[1:50:41] be bailed out I don't need help or
[1:50:44] support I can I can do it because I
[1:50:48] am a man
[1:50:54] but God hasn't made us that way God has
[1:50:57] made us to want Fellowship to desire
[1:51:02] fellowship and God has designed us to be
[1:51:05] in fellowship with him and in fellowship
[1:51:07] with our brothers and
[1:51:11] sisters this isn't something that we
[1:51:14] should take lightly this isn't something
[1:51:15] that we should
[1:51:17] just talk about Super E like oh yeah
[1:51:20] let's just let's get together for some
[1:51:21] fellowship it'll be great
[1:51:23] I mean it will be great that's that's a
[1:51:25] good
[1:51:25] thing this also isn't something that we
[1:51:28] toss around e like if I'm getting
[1:51:30] together with brother
[1:51:32] Miguel and we're going to have some
[1:51:34] fellowship I hope it's going to be about
[1:51:36] more than just what his latest
[1:51:39] electrical job was or what my the latest
[1:51:42] day at Chick-fil-A was
[1:51:45] like hopefully we're going to let our
[1:51:48] little licks of fire start to Fellowship
[1:51:49] a little bit and we're going to be
[1:51:50] talking about God and talking about what
[1:51:52] he's done to us recently and hey I
[1:51:55] recently was reading this verse and this
[1:51:57] stood out to me and I I've read this
[1:52:00] verse numerous times and I don't know
[1:52:02] why I never saw it before or I was
[1:52:05] listening to this message and brother
[1:52:07] Brandon was preaching and I know I've
[1:52:09] listened to this message
[1:52:12] before but I heard him say this and it
[1:52:15] never clicked
[1:52:21] before our fellowship is more than
[1:52:25] just hey you like coffee great let's
[1:52:27] have some
[1:52:31] coffee hey you like playing golf let's
[1:52:33] go play around to golf there's nothing
[1:52:36] wrong with golf I've played golf
[1:52:38] multiple times not multiple years so I
[1:52:42] don't need an invitation I'm I'm very
[1:52:45] Rusty but when we're out there with our
[1:52:48] brothers and our sisters doing whatever
[1:52:50] it might be
[1:52:53] you know I enjoyed listening to Luke and
[1:52:55] Paul as they talked about their hunting
[1:52:59] experiences and Luke especially talking
[1:53:02] about when he was out there with brother
[1:53:03] Wendell and brother Wendell talking
[1:53:06] about the Lord and different things
[1:53:09] and it wasn't like they had super deep
[1:53:12] conversations they weren't sitting out
[1:53:14] there you know talking about the seventh
[1:53:15] seal or
[1:53:17] whatever but it was just talking about
[1:53:19] the goodness of God and the beauty of
[1:53:22] nature that God had made or this that or
[1:53:25] the
[1:53:27] other but it was still that connection
[1:53:29] and that Fellowship going that is based
[1:53:32] around our creator the one who gave us
[1:53:34] the desire for
[1:53:36] Fellowship that's what we're
[1:53:37] fellowshipping about that's who we're
[1:53:39] fellowshipping around that's what draws
[1:53:41] us together is our desire for Fellowship
[1:53:44] pulls us back to the one who gave us
[1:53:46] that desire for Fellowship the one who
[1:53:48] started the desire for Fellowship
[1:54:01] Psalms
[1:54:05] 133 behold how good and pleasant it is
[1:54:07] for Brethren to dwell together in unity
[1:54:10] it is like the precious ointment upon
[1:54:12] the head that ran down upon the beard
[1:54:14] even Aaron's beard that went down to the
[1:54:17] skirts of his garments as the de of
[1:54:19] Herman and as the DW that descended upon
[1:54:22] the mountains of Zion for there the Lord
[1:54:24] commanded the blessing even life forever
[1:54:31] more how good and how pleasant is for
[1:54:33] Brethren to dwell together in
[1:54:36] unity well if we're there in unity that
[1:54:38] means we're having
[1:54:40] Fellowship we're having conversations
[1:54:42] we're connecting we're building
[1:54:46] relationships you know if you look at
[1:54:48] this
[1:54:51] ointment the incense the the special
[1:54:54] anointing oil that was
[1:54:56] created this was a recipe that was not
[1:54:58] allowed to be used for anything else
[1:55:01] okay if you were in Israel and you were
[1:55:05] caught with something that
[1:55:08] smelled close to what was at the
[1:55:12] temple you'd better be able to prove
[1:55:14] it's not the same or you were going to
[1:55:16] be
[1:55:19] killed this anointing oil was precious
[1:55:24] it was only for the
[1:55:27] temple that was the only place it could
[1:55:31] be the only ones that should smell like
[1:55:34] this were those that had been in the
[1:55:37] temple if you had been in the temple
[1:55:39] particularly as a priest when you left
[1:55:41] and walked away you would smell like you
[1:55:43] had come from there because you had been
[1:55:46] around those odors you had been in those
[1:55:48] Vapors for so long this was not
[1:55:50] something you could just pick up any
[1:55:53] anywhere this was something where you
[1:55:55] were going into the presence of God you
[1:55:58] were going into the temple that was how
[1:56:00] you got
[1:56:02] this this was not something that you
[1:56:04] went down to the corner market and
[1:56:05] bought this wasn't something that this
[1:56:08] uh oil vendor down the street carried
[1:56:11] multiple bottles
[1:56:13] of and so when the scriptures tell us
[1:56:16] that how good and how pleasant it's like
[1:56:19] the precious
[1:56:21] ointment that Unity that Fellowship is
[1:56:24] that precious it is so precious that you
[1:56:26] can only get it from one place True
[1:56:29] Fellowship only comes from
[1:56:31] God True Fellowship true Unity only
[1:56:35] comes if God's at the center of it
[1:56:39] whether that's the fellowship and
[1:56:40] relationship between a husband and wife
[1:56:42] whether that's the relationship in a
[1:56:44] congregation the only
[1:56:47] way that that actually is holding is
[1:56:50] because God's at the center of it
[1:56:57] you look at different situations Through
[1:56:58] The Years
[1:57:00] where places where there were Church
[1:57:04] splits and people got so many hurt
[1:57:06] feelings they had to go in different
[1:57:14] directions if they were holding on to
[1:57:16] just how precious that Fellowship was
[1:57:19] holding on to how precious that Unity is
[1:57:21] holding on to how precious the one who
[1:57:24] gave it to them
[1:57:26] was that's what holds a church together
[1:57:30] that's what holds a marriage
[1:57:32] together is the one who gave you that
[1:57:35] desire for Fellowship the one who gave
[1:57:37] you and created you with that desire for
[1:57:40] it if you're fellowshipping around the
[1:57:42] word if you're fellowshipping around God
[1:57:44] if you're fellowshipping around the one
[1:57:45] who gave you that desire you will be
[1:57:48] held
[1:57:50] together because God is at the
[1:57:53] center and he's the one who created
[1:57:57] it now I've said this multiple times and
[1:58:01] I'm going to keep saying it Satan hates
[1:58:05] Fellowship he wants to do everything he
[1:58:07] can to isolate you to drive you off to
[1:58:11] set you apart set you alone make you
[1:58:14] feel like you're not part of the group
[1:58:18] that you're not accepted that you're
[1:58:21] different that you're
[1:58:22] weird that you're whatever term you want
[1:58:25] to put with
[1:58:26] it he wants you to
[1:58:30] feel
[1:58:33] alone where God is sitting here and is
[1:58:36] going I want to be in fellowship with
[1:58:39] you brother Donald I want to sit down
[1:58:42] and spend time with you I want to sit
[1:58:44] down and minister to
[1:58:47] you God is going to each one of us and
[1:58:49] going hey I want some of this one-on-one
[1:58:53] time I want you to to get away with me
[1:58:56] for a little while I want you
[1:58:58] to spend time talking to just
[1:59:03] me hey with five kids my wife and I
[1:59:07] really really value anytime we can get
[1:59:11] just us
[1:59:13] to honestly at this moment we value
[1:59:15] anytime we can get where it's just us
[1:59:16] and
[1:59:18] Juniper she's kind of the age where we
[1:59:20] can't leave her behind too much but if
[1:59:22] we can get just us and her this is a
[1:59:24] good
[1:59:25] moment even if it's just running into
[1:59:27] the
[1:59:29] store we call those our Walmart dates
[1:59:32] leave the kids behind we could just go
[1:59:33] to the store for 10 minutes 15 minutes
[1:59:36] that's a great 10 minutes or 15 or
[1:59:40] whatever you know Juniper is not trying
[1:59:42] to interrupt the conversation she's just
[1:59:45] riding along so my wife and I can
[1:59:47] actually talk
[1:59:55] and that's the same way that I treasure
[1:59:58] that with my wife right now the same way
[1:59:59] that I value that is the same way that I
[2:00:03] should be valuing that time that I have
[2:00:04] with God
[2:00:23] was the ointment was special it was not
[2:00:27] something you can find everywhere and
[2:00:30] the unity and fellowship is
[2:00:32] special it's not something you find in
[2:00:34] every relationship it's not something
[2:00:36] you find in every Church body it's not
[2:00:40] something you find in every message
[2:00:42] Church
[2:00:46] body it's easy to start to take it
[2:00:48] lightly it's easy to start to take it as
[2:00:52] well this is common it's what we've
[2:00:55] always done here in
[2:01:00] Pony in
[2:01:02] the five six years I've been here it's
[2:01:04] what we always do we always get together
[2:01:06] this often we always do these many
[2:01:08] things together this is just normal so
[2:01:11] it's not a big deal if I
[2:01:14] skip it's not a big deal if I skip the
[2:01:17] lunches or it's not a big deal if I skip
[2:01:19] this or skip that because we always do
[2:01:22] them it's
[2:01:27] common Fellowship isn't
[2:01:30] common even if we're blessed to be in a
[2:01:32] church where it's something we do
[2:01:35] regularly it's not
[2:01:38] common when we look at the world it's
[2:01:41] not
[2:01:43] common the fellowship that we
[2:01:46] have with our
[2:01:48] spouses when you compare it to the kind
[2:01:50] of Fellowship the world has it's not not
[2:01:52] common the kind of relationship that you
[2:01:55] have with your children when you look at
[2:01:58] the world that's not common it's not
[2:02:02] common that a 15-year-old boy can talk
[2:02:04] to his mom about all kinds of
[2:02:07] subjects and yet that's what I get to
[2:02:09] watch at my house yeah my son talks to
[2:02:11] me too but watching him be able to walk
[2:02:14] talk to his
[2:02:18] mom and I look at the world and the way
[2:02:22] they're like my kids never talked to me
[2:02:24] I don't know anything about what's going
[2:02:26] on in their life it's
[2:02:28] like it's not
[2:02:30] common that kind of Fellowship is not
[2:02:35] common as much as we may be living in
[2:02:38] our little area and to us it starts to
[2:02:40] become
[2:02:42] common we need to take a step back and
[2:02:45] think about the blessings that we've
[2:02:48] received you know it's not common that
[2:02:51] we have this many young kids that can
[2:02:55] run up to elders and chat with
[2:02:58] them that's not common in this
[2:03:01] world you don't see little kids walk up
[2:03:04] to elders and hold
[2:03:07] conversations you don't see many Elders
[2:03:09] that would have the patience to talk to
[2:03:11] little kids like
[2:03:12] that you don't see many little kids that
[2:03:15] actually have any interest in talking to
[2:03:17] the elders these things aren't common
[2:03:22] but yet when you have God inspiring the
[2:03:25] fellowship when you have God at the
[2:03:27] center of the
[2:03:29] relationships The Uncommon becomes
[2:03:32] common it becomes the normal because
[2:03:35] this is how God works this is how God
[2:03:38] has designed us this is how God has
[2:03:40] designed the family this is how God has
[2:03:42] designed a church body to
[2:03:48] work and we
[2:03:50] enjoy how normal that
[2:03:53] is but we have to keep ourself from
[2:03:57] allowing it to become common to
[2:04:00] us and allowing it to become something
[2:04:03] that we can push to the side because
[2:04:05] it's not
[2:04:09] important I remember when we first moved
[2:04:12] over to this church building and I
[2:04:13] didn't have a lot of experiences in the
[2:04:15] other church building but I remember
[2:04:18] hearing different ones in the Cong
[2:04:22] congregation that all
[2:04:24] said I wish we had some of those same
[2:04:27] memories here I wish some of those same
[2:04:31] times that they had had pouring out
[2:04:33] their heart at that
[2:04:34] altar they like we want that
[2:04:41] here and I have had some of those here I
[2:04:45] didn't get any of those there I wasn't
[2:04:48] at that building long enough
[2:04:51] and I've had those experiences
[2:04:55] here but now I have to be on guard of
[2:04:57] going do I allow that to become common
[2:05:00] to
[2:05:01] me do I allow that fellowship with my
[2:05:06] God to become
[2:05:09] common that it's not as important to go
[2:05:12] up to the altar now because I've done it
[2:05:15] however many times it's not it's not
[2:05:17] that big a
[2:05:18] deal it's not that important for me to
[2:05:23] kneel at my Pew or it's not that
[2:05:25] important for me to do this or do
[2:05:30] that because it's a fellowship that
[2:05:32] we've done so many times
[2:05:35] and in so many
[2:05:37] ways same thing people will talk about
[2:05:40] with their spouse that their spouse can
[2:05:43] become common to them and so they're no
[2:05:44] longer trying to date their
[2:05:49] girlfriend you know it still makes me
[2:05:51] grin anytime brother W's up here and
[2:05:52] calls sister Fresa's girlfriend I'm like
[2:05:55] good that's how I want to be doing it as
[2:05:57] I continue to get older I wanted to keep
[2:06:00] being that that's my girlfriend and so
[2:06:03] I'm trying to find ways to make her
[2:06:06] smile I'm trying to find ways to make
[2:06:08] her blush I'm trying to find ways to do
[2:06:13] whatever to let her know that she still
[2:06:16] has my
[2:06:18] attention that she doesn't have to be
[2:06:21] concerned
[2:06:23] that I'm looking at any of the other
[2:06:25] women that are around or that I'm
[2:06:26] putting my attention somewhere else
[2:06:29] because she's still my
[2:06:34] focus it's the same thing between us and
[2:06:39] God we can let that relationship become
[2:06:42] common we can let that let that
[2:06:45] relationship
[2:06:48] become okay I know every morning morning
[2:06:51] I get up and I say a quick prayer to
[2:06:53] start the day you know I don't really
[2:06:56] have time Lord to be here for too long
[2:06:58] so let's let's keep this quick you know
[2:06:59] I've got a quick I can give you five
[2:07:00] minutes and then I got to be on the road
[2:07:02] to my job or to the job site or to
[2:07:05] whatever Lord I don't I don't have time
[2:07:07] this morning to read you know multiple
[2:07:09] chapters but I I can give you a verse I
[2:07:12] I can do that and get on the
[2:07:16] road hey I've been guilty I'm not I'm
[2:07:20] not pointing out at all all of you I
[2:07:23] have done
[2:07:25] that look I've even been bad enough to
[2:07:28] just get up and be like oh man I'm late
[2:07:31] and hit the road without any prayer or
[2:07:37] verses I've been there I've done
[2:07:42] that and it's easy to get wrapped up
[2:07:45] into life it's
[2:07:48] easy for the moms
[2:07:52] that their kids the kids wore her out
[2:07:56] she slept
[2:07:57] late now she got up and she's trying to
[2:08:00] get around to get everything done and
[2:08:02] she feels
[2:08:06] behind and she's so stressed out because
[2:08:11] things aren't going the way that she
[2:08:12] planned it's not going like routine
[2:08:14] normally
[2:08:15] allows man I just don't have time to
[2:08:19] pray today or I don't have time
[2:08:22] to turn on a message or I don't have
[2:08:24] time to do this or do
[2:08:27] that it
[2:08:30] happens there are days where I have
[2:08:33] rushed out of my house and I did not
[2:08:36] kiss my wife goodbye and she makes sure
[2:08:38] to text me to let me know
[2:08:41] um or she will text me later in the day
[2:08:43] and be like did you kiss me goodbye
[2:08:45] before you
[2:08:49] left sometimes I can say yeah you were
[2:08:51] sleep you just don't remember it but
[2:08:53] there are other times I'm like no I
[2:08:57] didn't it is easy to allow things to
[2:09:00] become common or to get wrapped up in
[2:09:01] business or to get wrapped up in
[2:09:03] whatever is going
[2:09:05] on it's easy for us to
[2:09:08] allow the fellowship and the
[2:09:11] relationship and the unity to become
[2:09:14] common so that it has less importance to
[2:09:19] us but in a world where Satan is doing
[2:09:22] everything he can to wreck that Satan is
[2:09:25] doing everything he can to push that
[2:09:28] apart this needs to be one of the things
[2:09:31] that we look at in our lives and go you
[2:09:34] know what I'm putting a lot of value on
[2:09:37] this the fellowship I have with my
[2:09:39] Creator the fellowship I have with my
[2:09:41] brothers and sisters this is important
[2:09:44] and if it means that I miss out on
[2:09:47] whatever okay because this is important
[2:09:50] this has value this is going to last
[2:09:53] this is going to hold
[2:09:55] me this is going to ensure that when my
[2:09:58] kids get older I still have a good
[2:10:01] relationship with them and they want to
[2:10:02] talk to me I talked to multiple people
[2:10:05] at chickf that talk about their
[2:10:07] relationship with their parents and like
[2:10:08] they want to be around they don't want
[2:10:10] them around when they are planning to
[2:10:12] come visit it's like a headache and a
[2:10:15] hassle it's more how quickly are they
[2:10:17] going to leave
[2:10:22] that's the normal in the
[2:10:24] world our normal is different our normal
[2:10:26] is I want my kids to enjoy being around
[2:10:30] me because we've had that relationship
[2:10:31] from when we were younger from when they
[2:10:32] were younger they knew they had parents
[2:10:35] that invested in them when they were
[2:10:36] younger that weren't so wrapped up in
[2:10:40] their jobs or wrapped up in their
[2:10:41] Hobbies wrapped up or
[2:10:43] whatever and I wanted to be that when
[2:10:46] I'm
[2:10:47] older that the presence of God is an old
[2:10:50] friend
[2:10:52] that I have experienced that I have been
[2:10:54] in it's not something I'm trying to
[2:10:56] search for when I'm
[2:10:59] older it's not something I'm still
[2:11:01] trying to
[2:11:03] find and I can say that because I'm
[2:11:05] growing up in the church I want this to
[2:11:06] be something that when I get
[2:11:08] older that's the
[2:11:11] normal I don't want it to be something
[2:11:13] that I'm having to hunt for and search
[2:11:15] for and be like well Lord I finally got
[2:11:17] time for you where are you
[2:11:21] [Music]
[2:11:26] God calls us to
[2:11:28] Fellowship because that was the desire
[2:11:31] that he had and so it's the desire that
[2:11:34] he placed in every one of
[2:11:42] us I'm going to do something a little
[2:11:44] bit different for me and hopefully
[2:11:48] brother wend
[2:11:49] will forgive me for this
[2:11:52] but I'd like to to copy brother Wendell
[2:11:55] for a moment i' like everybody to stand
[2:11:57] up and let's form one of our circles
[2:12:01] everyone circle
[2:12:02] around get your hands
[2:12:07] together everyone's I'm gonna one more
[2:12:09] quote in the mystery of revealed brother
[2:12:12] says one another above everything love
[2:12:14] one another don't no matter what the
[2:12:16] devil tries to say now you're all one
[2:12:18] great big sweet group now but remember
[2:12:20] my warning see
[2:12:22] Satan won't let that stay that way no
[2:12:23] sir he'll shoot everything if he has to
[2:12:27] bring somebody in to make his Target
[2:12:28] he'll he'll bring some critic or
[2:12:30] unbeliever in and sit him down and cause
[2:12:32] him to fellowship with you under the
[2:12:34] quietness and things then he'll shoot
[2:12:36] that guy with some kind of poison stuff
[2:12:37] and he'll start through the church with
[2:12:39] it don't you take sides with it don't
[2:12:41] you have nothing to do with
[2:12:46] it you stay right loving sweet and kind
[2:12:50] to one another pray for that man that
[2:12:52] he'll be saved too or that woman orever
[2:12:54] who it is just pray for them and stick
[2:12:55] one with
[2:12:57] another and stay with your pastor see
[2:12:59] he's the shepherd and you give him
[2:13:01] respects he'll lead you through because
[2:13:04] he's ordained of God to do
[2:13:06] so now do you remember that the enemy
[2:13:10] will come and when he does just cling
[2:13:11] that much closer together and the one
[2:13:13] that the devil is using for an enemy
[2:13:15] will either get out or come in and be
[2:13:17] one of you that's
[2:13:18] all don't never Clan among one or talk
[2:13:21] make yourself clannish we are one I
[2:13:24] couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you
[2:13:26] I'm going to take you away because
[2:13:28] you're not a right hand he's my left
[2:13:30] hand I want him to stay there even the
[2:13:33] little tip of my finger I want to stay
[2:13:35] right there every little part of my body
[2:13:37] stay right there and God wants us as a
[2:13:39] body of Believers to stay right exactly
[2:13:41] with one
[2:13:42] another right at with one
[2:13:47] another brother Nathaniel go ahead and
[2:13:49] come on down
[2:13:53] you can leave the the camera sitting on
[2:13:55] an empty spot if you need
[2:13:58] to and I know my wife's out there with
[2:14:01] Silas go ahead and bring bring him in if
[2:14:04] I need to I'll hold
[2:14:07] silus if they'll go ahead and come
[2:14:17] in this isn't something that
[2:14:21] we should take
[2:14:23] lightly even these moments being able to
[2:14:26] do this this is one of those
[2:14:28] where it's kind of common for our
[2:14:31] church I I mean I've seen brother wend
[2:14:34] do
[2:14:35] this so many times where we all gather
[2:14:39] together
[2:14:40] and sometimes we're in the mood to do it
[2:14:42] sometimes we're like oh he's doing it
[2:14:49] again but yeah this isn't even these are
[2:14:53] not moments that we should take lightly
[2:15:23] being able to gather together being able
[2:15:25] to hold one another's hands being able
[2:15:28] to to pray together
[2:15:32] and being able to just look across the
[2:15:35] circle and
[2:15:38] know I'm not
[2:15:42] alone however much God may have been
[2:15:45] what s I'm sorry however much Satan may
[2:15:47] have been hitting me all week and trying
[2:15:49] to make me feel s separate and trying to
[2:15:51] make me
[2:15:55] feel alone and cut
[2:16:00] off there are brothers and sisters all
[2:16:02] around me and there are brothers and
[2:16:04] sisters across from
[2:16:11] me we're just waiting a moment my my
[2:16:13] wife's coming out right now I think I
[2:16:15] caught her mid diaper change
[2:16:24] come here
[2:16:27] syus come on
[2:16:38] buddy this
[2:16:43] is this is not something that we take
[2:16:47] lightly this isn't something
[2:16:49] that we cre as
[2:16:52] being
[2:16:55] simple God created
[2:16:59] us because he had a desire for
[2:17:02] Fellowship God created us in His image
[2:17:05] so we have that same desire for
[2:17:12] fellowship and in a world that is so
[2:17:15] focused
[2:17:17] on your own
[2:17:21] self-care self-gratification
[2:17:24] fulfilling my own desires whatever it
[2:17:27] might
[2:17:29] be God is calling
[2:17:31] us and reminding
[2:17:35] us that he wants us to fellowship with
[2:17:38] him and he wants us to fellowship with
[2:17:41] our brothers and
[2:17:43] sisters Satan wants to drive us apart
[2:17:45] but God is calling us to be together
[2:17:52] I just want to take a moment
[2:17:54] to to pray like this and
[2:17:57] then brother Wendell can say whatever he
[2:18:02] feels he should say as
[2:18:04] we are
[2:18:08] dismissing Lord Jesus we come into your
[2:18:10] presence this evening Lord
[2:18:13] and Lord we
[2:18:16] just Lord we thank you for your presence
[2:18:18] Lord
[2:18:20] Lord we thank you
[2:18:23] that Lord that you had a
[2:18:27] desire to fellowship with each one of us
[2:18:31] Lord Lord not only did you create us but
[2:18:34] Lord you went and then you paid the
[2:18:36] price to redeem us and bring us
[2:18:40] back lord you shed your blood so
[2:18:43] that my sins could be washed away so
[2:18:46] that I could be lifted up into your
[2:18:47] presence Lord
[2:18:51] Lord
[2:18:53] I Lord help
[2:18:56] us to not take that lightly
[2:18:59] Lord Lord my brothers and sisters that
[2:19:02] are all gathered here with me Lord

[2:19:07] granted Lord and help them not to become
[2:19:09] common to me Lord but Lord help me to
[2:19:12] have that desire to to fellowship with
[2:19:14] them Lord to love them to to share our
[2:19:18] licks of fire back and forth
[2:19:23] Lord
[2:19:24] You Lord you you said not to forsake
[2:19:28] gathering together even as we see the
[2:19:30] end time approaching and Lord we know it
[2:19:32] can't be
[2:19:35] far Lord help us to to stoke that desire
[2:19:39] Lord
[2:19:40] to to be with your children Lord to be
[2:19:44] with our brothers and sisters to be in
[2:19:46] your presence Lord
[2:19:49] Jesus Lord
[2:19:51] I pray that you would forgive us of the
[2:19:53] many times we take it for granted
[2:19:57] Lord Lord all the times

[2:21:15] fellowship and value that Fellowship
[2:21:17] more than we ever have before
