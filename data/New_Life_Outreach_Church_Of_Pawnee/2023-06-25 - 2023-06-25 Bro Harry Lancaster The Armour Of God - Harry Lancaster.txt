into your hands the name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen [Music] let's go ahead and turn to Romans chapter 13. Romans chapter 13 and we'll start at verse 12. the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as in the day not in rioting and drunkenness not in chambering and wantonness not in strife and envying but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof then we'll turn to Second Corinthians chapter 6. second Corinthians chapter 6 and we'll start at verse 4. but in all things approving ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience and afflictions and necessities and distresses in stripes and imprisonments and tumults and labors in watchings and fastings by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love unfeigned by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left you may have your seats and we're going to go ahead and turn to Ephesians chapter 6. Ephesians chapter 6 and we'll start at verse 10. finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickingness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand there for having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints so we're going to be basically just having a little bit of a Sunday school class because I'm going to talk about the armor of God and Maybe the adults in the audience maybe you're just going to be along for the ride while I'm talking to the kids maybe I'll say something you haven't heard before we'll see what happens but the armor of God is something that is talked about in most every Sunday school class in some way um in fact when I started Sunday school teaching here it was one of the first series that I did for them was going through the armor of God brother Branham said in the sermon the greatest battle ever fought he said and so in Army first in getting ready for a battle first there's got to be a select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting and I believe that the greatest battle was ever fought is now ready to go in action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them training them and the Battlefront is now set getting ready to start now as far as I understand um Paul when he was writing the book of Ephesians he was under house arrest in Rome he was a Roman citizen and not only did he have the opportunity to to watch Roman soldiers March around the city but he also knew that the Roman army was the most powerful of its day sister keys if you'd pull up that first picture even today if you look at history or look up what people talk about lecturing they will still hold up the Roman legion as being one of the most powerful armies of all time the Roman army was powerful forced due to their extensive training and their strong discipline fully trained Roman soldiers were the cream of the crop they were the best of the best so in this scripture it started off with and these are not to go ahead and preface this these are not listed in any order of importance as Paul's writing this so he's not saying the first one is the least important or the most important they're all important they all have different levels of importance so we're not going to say this is better than that but start off the first thing that Paul talks about is the belt of Truth the belt of a Roman soldier in Paul's day was not a simple leather strap such as we wear today I can look around and particularly for those that are wearing any type of church belt or dress belt it's this real thin belt going around that's really not meant to support much you're not meant to like clip a whole bunch to it to hold it or anything but the belts that the Roman soldiers would wear were very thick heavy leather and metal bands that would wrap around them they were designed not only to help provide protection but they were also designed to hold the Soldier's sword as well as to have the armor attached to it to help Provide support it provided a firm foundation for everything else that was being attached to it brother manham said in the sermon Israel in the church he said let's just take the loins girded about with a girl with a girdle that's the belt that holds the rest of it together gird your loins with truth in that day brother when there's all kinds of isms and fanaticisms it's time to gird yourself with the truth Jesus said I am the truth the truth I tell you when people say what about this what about that it's good to see that old truth buckled around you isn't it knowing where you're standing then stand there let them say well you have this that and the other you know where you're standing have the whole armor buckled on gird around here buckled down good and tight and pull down with the truth of God's word anchored in your heart all the devils in hell can't upset you that's right you can meet Satan say it's written hallelujah oh I tell you brother did you take up serpents no sir I believe Jesus Christ did you do this that or the other no sir I received the bathrooms of the Holy Ghost buckled about an armor on girded with truth and brother Randolph said in the sermon Redemption by power he said a man now when he comes into Christ he gets his gospel shoes on to preach the gospel the helmet of salvation on the breastplate of righteousness girds up his loins usually in the old Soldiers when they put on those ornaments of War they had a big belt they had buckled it together holding over their loins these shields keep the enemy Spears off what a real lesson that is to us and when the loin began to get weak hang down the shield they would tighten up on their belt to bring them up tight again what a perfect picture today when you begin to feel like you're you're slacking and the devil says it's no use reach down tighten up the belt a little bit pull up the sword a little tighter in the hand and go forward I like that be ready for the March the armor of God will not be supported by any falsehood Truth by its very definition is exclusive for something to be true it immediately means that other things are a lie or are false there is no mixture here these are the oil and water they don't go together if this is truth that can't be but yet nowadays we live in a day when people say that they can decide their own truth in the Washington Times on Wednesday October 20th in 2021 there's an article that they're releasing Paul most Americans say truth is subjective no absolute right or wrong a quote from the article says we're just at a place in our country's history now where that's the default view most people would say all truth is subjective and there's no kind of objective truth based on an external standard they would say they're the standard that determines what truth is the poll says that 88 percent of adults in America craft a unique worldview fashioned from the personally appealing parts of other worldviews so they won't look at it and say that Christianity is truth they'll say well I like this part of Christianity or they'll even do it within the Christian world and say well like this of being a Baptist and I like this of being a Methodist and I like this of being a name off whichever denomination you want to I like this it being message I like this the following Brother random but I don't like that part I like this part of this I like that part of that they want to build their own truth they can't look at and just say this is truth this is what I'm building on this is the strong Foundation but like I said the armor of God can't be supported by falsehood if you want all the pieces to work together you have to have the truth to start with John chapter 8 and verse 44 it says year of your father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and a boat not on the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he's speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it John chapter 17 starting at verse 15 it says I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but thou should but thou but that thou shouldest keep them from Evil they are not of the world even as I am not of the world sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth and Romans chapter 3 and verse 4 God forbid yea let God be true but every man a liar as it is written that thou mightest be justified in thy sayings and might as overcome when thou art judged after the belt of Truth the next thing that Paul lists is the breastplate of righteousness now under the Roman Republic all the legionnaires wore a bronze cures consisting of a breastplate with a border of pendant leather straps defending the lower part of the body that comes from the encyclopedia Americana Strong's Concordance says that the Greek word used for breastplate is thorax now the breastplate was designed to prevent a blow from an enemy's sword or other weapon from reaching a soldier's vital organ particularly the heart it would be difficult to apply a death blow to the Torso of a soldier wearing this type of body armor a Roman soldier's breastplate is described by polybius as a bronze plate measuring a span every way which they wear on their breasts and call A Heart Guard or cardiofulax the breastplate was one of the most vital pieces of ancient armor because it shielded the wear from the main thrust and direction of the enemy's weapon it protected the vital organs second Corinthians chapter 5 and verse 21 it says for he have made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him brother random says in the sermon the greatest battle ever fought he says now listen All Ye soldiers now just before we start the prayer line take unto you the whole not just part the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day that's the day we're living in and having done all to stand when you've done all that you can do to stand then stand don't move stand there for having your loins listen to this listen here with us as your loins that's your middle part here see girded about with truth what is the truth the word of God that's right Thy word is truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness that is do what's right got the word of God in you doing what's right the breastplate of righteousness Romans chapter 6 and verse 16 it says know ye not that to whom you build yourself servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteousness but God be thanked that you were the Servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of Doctrine which was delivered being then made free from sin you became Servants of righteousness you became servants that were doing what's right Servants of righteousness I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity and unto iniquity and even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto Holiness for when ye were the Servants of sin ye were free from righteousness righteousness is the quality of being morally right or justifiable so we have truth that's belted around the middle as the support for everything else you have the righteousness that covers all of your most vital organs it's the covering the area that the enemy is most likely to be thrusting at or slashing at the righteousness is what's covering this is what's protecting this area the righteousness of you living what's right and doing what God tells you to do brother Branham says in the sermon who do you say this is God makes it thus one to be so dishonorable to show up The Honorable ones one to be so far wrong it shows up if it wasn't that would be the right thing if there wasn't there cannot be a bogus dollar until there's a real dollar if you just made the bogus to begin with then it would be the real one but it's a copy there cannot be sin until there's righteousness because righteousness is the right thing and sin is the perversion of righteousness in other words a truth is a truth a lie can't be a lie until there's a truth first to pervert that truth into a lie so all sin is nothing but righteousness perverted therefore there's a system in the world Romans chapter 10 and verse 9 says that if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed second Corinthians chapter 6 verse 7. by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left second Timothy chapter 4 and verse 8 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing what if brother Branham said in the sermon it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness he says what difference does it make whether we got a nickel or a dime whether we got something to eat or whether we haven't whether we're living or Dying God promised the meek shall inherit the earth it behooveth us it's becoming to us that we live like it act like it must fulfill all righteousness God wants men and women who will stand and fulfill all righteousness and of course righteousness is his word righteousness is living his word righteousness is living what we know to be true what we know to be correct what we know to be what God is Desiring us to do brother random also says in a normal another sermon he says and righteousness is an attribute of Faith because you anchored in that Faith confirmation evidence now after the breastplate of righteousness in Ephesians chapter 6 verse 15 it says and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace if you would put up that second a Roman sandal during Paul's letters was called a and I may butcher this but a caligay the caligate were sandals that laced over the foot and up the leg the calendar were perfect for summer combat and high temperatures when the foot skin was not fully covered and could breathe the solid Soul guaranteed the stability and durability of the Footwear and the lightness and the workmanship did not burden the legs the openness of the caligan enabled the soldiers to wear them all day to work March stand in them for long periods without discomfort the leather strips were made so that they did not rub against certain parts of the feet and cause sores when marching through marshy ground rivers or streams the woven straps would allow the water to escape instead of keeping it contained within like a solid boot the underside of the caligate was fitted with studs which you can see in that picture Not only would they protect the soldiers feet over rough ground but they also helped to maintain stability when on wet or slippery ground brother Brandon said in the greatest battle I ever fought as he's describing the armor he says and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace go anywhere anyplace anytime feet shod with the gospel see now these sandals allowed them to have stability when they were fighting the same way that if you see any type of person playing professional Athletics now they have cleats I used to play baseball I had I had my ball cleats that I would play that would give me the grip as I was running along the clay if you see football players if you even see people playing golf have spikes on their shoes in order to have the better grip when they're driving the ball they still have they're still using that same idea to give them the stability that they need and so the Roman soldiers had these on there so that when they were on the battlefield they were not going to lose their footing they were not going to fall they weren't going to end up on the ground because once a soldier was on the ground the chance that they got up was not very high as soon as they were down they were vulnerable and so here Paul is describing this and he says your feet shod with the gospel of peace and so as you're going through life and dealing with all the stresses dealing with all the trials dealing with all the troubles that put us on this foundation and ground that isn't firm anymore God shots us with peace to say you can stand no matter how turbulent the waves no matter how stormy the Seas you can stand because I can give you the peace where you can stand on that uneven Terrain according to the American Institute of stress about 33 percent of people report feeling extreme stress 77 percent of people experience stress that affects their physical health 73 percent of people have stress that impacts their Mental Health 48 of people have trouble sleeping because of stress the global Organization for stress reports that 75 percent of Americans experienced moderate to high stress levels in the past month stress is the number one Health concern of high school students eighty percent of people feel stress at work major depressive disorder affects approximately 17.3 million American adults or about 7.1 percent of the U.S population ages 18 and older in a given year this is from a study they did in 2017. I couldn't find a study more recent but I feel like the numbers have gone higher major depressive disorder is more prevalent in women than in men that was found in 2003. depression is the cause of over two-thirds of the thirty thousand reported suicides in the U.S each year that's from 1999. I looked for newer data the fact they're not publishing it tells me the numbers are not getting better they're not pointing and going C we're improving things so if it was that bad in 1999 that two-thirds of suicides are from depression most oppression comes from stress being built up over time what is it like today so why are we instructed to wear the sandals of the Gospel of the peace because in a world of stress depression and so much turmoil God is telling us how we can stand just as the caligate allowed the Roman soldier to have firm footing no matter what the terrain the gospel of peace allows us to have firm footing no matter what the trial no matter what we're going through second Timothy chapter 1 verse 7 says for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind Philippians chapter 4 and verse 7 says and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus so we have Truth at the core that everything else gets attached to to make sure that the armor holds the way it's supposed to you have the breastplate of righteousness which is buckled to the belt of Truth which helps protect all of your vital organs and provides the barrier for where the enemy is normally going to be trying to hit trying to attack you have the shoes of the gospel of peace to allow you to stand no matter what the terrain no matter what you're walking through no matter what trial or what test may be happening you can have the peace to keep standing and keep walking obviously standing is kind of a big deal because when you go through this section of the verse it starts off by saying put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil and then wherefore taken to you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand an evil day and having done all to stand the very next verse stand therefore and then verse feed verse 15 having your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace God is making it very clear you're supposed to be standing and the way you stand is because I've given you the peace to stand to keep going through to keep walking along the path after the feet shot of the preparation of the gospel of peace verse 16 in Ephesians chapter 6 says above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith he should be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked Hebrews chapter 11 and verse 1 says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report and first John chapter 5 and verse 4 says for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith now please excuse me this is probably going to be the section where a lot of you have already heard me talk about this because we had a New Year's service a couple years ago and I talked about the shield of faith and so a lot of this is in the same thing so if you're hearing it again I hope something's fresh but um sister if you put up the next picture so the Roman Shield was called a scutum it was a large rectangular curved shield made from three sheets of wood glued together together and then covered with canvas and leather this got him was light enough to be held in one hand and its large height and width covered the entire wielder making him very unlikely to be hit by missile fire and in hand-to-hand combat the metal boss or umbo in the center of the scutum also made it an auxiliary punching weapon when necessary some sources say that the tough tough leather on its own was resistant to fire arrows but other sources say that before going into battle Roman soldiers would dip their Shields into water in order to ensure that the wet leather could quench the darts of the enemy Ephesians chapter 5 and verse 26 says that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish if we ensure that our Shield of faith is continually soaking in the water of the word then there's no chance that the fiery darts of the enemy can cause us any harm no this is probably my favorite part when I was studying out the shield but as strong as each individual soldier in the Roman army might be Roman troops always fought together in formation as a group and this made them especially powerful against less organized enemies who frequently fought with little formation one of the formations they used was called the testudo or the tortoise formation to the next picture please so in this testudo formation the men would align their Shields to form a packed formation covered with shields on the front and the top while this formation did reduce speed and mobility of the formation it offered consistent defensive strength against opposing infantry and excellent protection against arrows and other missile attacks the key was that and when I wasn't just me protecting me I was now standing there beside my brother to go here I've got this side of you and they were beside the next brother going I've got this side and then the ones that were behind us were lifting their Shields up over going here we've got above because you've got the front we'll make sure that your head's covered so you're not going to have the arrows raining down on top of you and so they became more powerful because they fought side by side as a group it wasn't an individual store Soldier it was the whole formation it was the body as a body of Christ were able to take on the enemy it's not us out on our own being hey I'm the Lone Wolf I can handle every single thing there God calls us to fight together with our brothers and our sisters and if they begin to get weak we're there to help cover the side we're there to help cover above them we're here there to help defend them with our Shields locked right with outside each other they knew that they could stand against whatever enemy was coming against them because they weren't facing it alone brother Brandon said in the sermon the mighty conqueror he says you know when the heat of the day is on the sheep all get together and they stand against one another and they make shade for each other and they support each other so that's the way the Sheep of God should do kind of Stand Together close places and support one another with our faith Psalms chapter 133 verse 1 says behold how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity it is like the precious ointment upon the head that ran down upon the beard even Aaron's beard that went down to the skirts of his garments brother Brandon said in the sermon life he said so what little I have got that he has given me I'm trying to share it with you Brethren see you're the church may we all just stay one see and just stay together as brothers and let's share what we got with each other that way we're in a great battle and we're battling sin not one another we're going to fight we're not going to fight at one another then Satan can set back and just let us fight it out see but let's turn our everything we got towards the kingdom put our shoulders one again with the other start moving upward and work for there because I don't think we got too much longer I think we're right at the end of the road maybe it's just because I'm getting to be an old man that I think that but no it isn't that because I thought that all the time I believe that we're at the end of the road and let's pray and help support in the sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed love one another above everything love one another don't no matter what the devil tries to say now you're all one great big sweet group but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff it'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved or that woman or whoever it is just pray for them and stick one with another thank you after the shield going into verse 17 of Ephesians it says and take the helmet of salvation Isaiah 59 and verse 17 says for he put on righteousness as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation upon his head and he put on the garments of Vengeance for clothing and was clad with Zeal as a cloak first Thessalonians chapter 5 and verse 8 it says but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation in the greatest battle ever fought brother Branham describing the helmet says how are you going to let this helmet what it does it's protection what is the helmet made out of brass brass can't even be tempered hard it's it's hard harder than iron a brass headpiece the Salvation knowledge of knowingness and my healing comes from God my salvation comes from God my experience matches his word not the church's idea the word amen there you are covered over with a protection the helmet of salvation Deliverance if you would pull up the next pictures keys the Roman helmet was known as a Galia it could vary quite a bit in design since Mass manufacturing didn't exist at that time and each helmet was created individually there was also some variation in the helmet design just during the life of the Roman Empire usually the helmets were made of metal although in the early days of the Empire some of the poor soldiers may have had leather helmets fortified with pieces of metal usually they were made out of metal the most obvious value of the helmet was to protect against blows to the head but it had two purposes protection and identification helmets usually had cheek plates to guard against blows to the face and a metal piece in the back to predict protect against blows to the back of the neck in addition during the early first century the helmet began to include a brow Ridge to provide protection for the eyes helmets worn by legionnaires and centurions had crests made of plumes of horsehair which were usually dyed red with the distinct nature of their helmets it was easy to identify these men in the midst of battle now when we think about the helmet normally when a man was fighting he was using the shield to block now because he was using the shield to block most of the blows that didn't mean that he went oh I don't need a helmet anymore the helmet was if he missed with the shield the helmet was for the shield got knocked away his sword got knocked away it provided that final bit of protection he didn't walk out on the field of battle with the helmet going great I can take all the blows to the head I want because I have a helmet that's not the thought process that's why you had a shield it's the same thing as on the job sites when the guys have to wear helmets at a construction site or whatever you're not going great I can let as many things fall in my head as I want because I have a helmet it's simply there in case something happens for those in baseball when they're wearing a batting helmet I'm not wanting to get a ball to the head but just in case I have the helmet the helmet there was at was there as a defense if the shield if they got around the shield if the enemy was able to get past that barrier they still had the helmet the helmet was projecting obviously The Head and the Brain it was to keep you functioning so that you could keep fighting if you didn't have the helmet one good blow you were gone the helmet allowed you to keep fighting if you lost your Shield if you missed a swing from the enemy you could take a hit and you could keep fighting now as I said the helmet was not just for protection it was also for identification because you could recognize particularly who your leaders were on the battlefield because each of the helmets looked a little bit different the plumes were put on just a little bit different and so you could go that's my commander that's where I need to stay this is the person I Dean to be around okay brother Brandon said in the sermon Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said and then as we are Sons and Daughters of God and Joint heirs with him in the Kingdom then we express them in our lives sometimes if many of us would just live our sermons instead of preaching I think it'd be better if we just go ahead and live the sermon you know it's a lot better to live me one than it is to preach me one I believe because I can see your life God looks at your lives and the world looks at your lives he wants to know what our lives are and people know us no matter our actions are so loud it drowns out our testimony depends on what we say if we are Christians and don't live it then the people know better but when we are Christians and say we're Christians and live like Christians a lot Our Lives will do it if we never said nothing else our lives were written Epistles red of all men so they watch how you walk and I was thinking the other day about being sealed by the Holy Spirit a seal is marked on both sides they see you coming they see you going look like a Christian coming you look like a Christian going when you're sealed by the Holy Spirit so your salvation your salvation changes your life and people can see that they can recognize on the battlefield to go hey he's in that army he's not on he's not still fighting for this side he's not with the rest of the world finding that side there's something different he's got the plumes to Mark him out as he's in the Christian Army now whether he's on the job site and you don't say a word whether it's our sisters going through the grocery store being out and about people look at the lives and go wait there's something different there that doesn't match up with the rest of the people around them they can look at it and they can identify and that salvation not only is there for protection it also is an identification that anyone can look at and go there's something different there that's not what we see on everyone else that's not how everyone else Acts that's not how everyone else handles these situations that not that's not the response everyone else gives there's an identification there Romans chapter 10 and verse 10 says for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness foreign and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed Isaiah chapter 12 and verse 2 says behold God is my salvation I will trust and not be afraid for the Lord Jehovah is my strength and my song he also has become my salvation Psalm 62 and verse 1. truly my soul waiteth upon the Lord for him come from him cometh my salvation he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense I shall not be greatly moved we have the shield of Faith up that's our main defense that's what protects us against their everything that we're facing but sometimes maybe you'll get a little bit weak and the faith drops just a little bit and the enemy is able to strike through but there's still the helmet of salvation that protects you your face shifted just a little bit okay we've gotta we've got to rebind we've got to strengthen gotta lift the faith back up but you didn't get lost because your faith dipped a little you didn't change it you the Salvation was still there the helmet of salvation didn't change just because the shield dipped a little now we're trying to train it the The Shield is light enough as we're being trained to hold it up so that it doesn't dip but if it does the helmet's still there you still have the protection to keep on fighting to go oh okay he rung my bell a little bit but I can lift my shield back up and I can keep going because that defense that salvation still provided the protection as I keep on fighting [Applause] and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints in the sermon the greatest battle ever fought again brother Branham says what do you want to do then take the word what is the word the Bible said here we just read it for the spirit and of God is the word see look here and take the helmet of salvation and the sword the sword of the spirit the sword of the spirit what the spirit that comes in through your mind and enters into you and the sword of the spirit is the word of God what does that Spirit fight with how does the Holy Spirit fight with Sensations feelings the word Glory what does it fight with feelings the word let's say it word the word of God is what the spirit fights with the spirit of God walks right up to the devil and says it is written amen it is written and the devil gives way what do we do take the sword which is the word of God pull it with a hand of Faith a strong hand of faith the two-edged sword the Bible said in Hebrews 4 it's a two-edged sword Cuts both coming and going brother what does he do take the word take the spirit let the Spirit come into your heart open up your mind and say Thy word is true now you do this sister Thy word is truth Lord I ain't gonna pay any attention how I feel what anybody self says I'm stopping up I'm blowing out every one of my Avenues all the frustrations and doubts and unbeliefs that I've ever had every feeling I ever had all the sickness I ever had everything else I ever had I'm blowing them all out I'm bypassing all that I'm coming right straight to my spirit oh Lord come down you said you made me a free moral agent you are my son all right I open up my heart and my mind come in Lord Jesus and grab the faith that sword of the spirit thus saith the Lord scream hallelujah amen then cut down every enemy in front of you amen there it is cut every enemy if an old spooky Spirit making you feel all cut that thing away with the word of the Lord sister keys if you put up the next one the sword used by Roman soldiers was a short sword known as a Gladius and in the hands of a skilled man it was a fearsome weapon in fact it became known as the sword that conquered the world it was sharp sharpened on both sides making it lethal against unarmed unarmored foe the point was also sharpened enabling it to pierce armor usually it was only around 20 to 30 inches long the Gladius was not the medieval style long sword that is usually associated with the armor of God if you go to any store and buy the armor of God Playset for your kids doesn't have the right kind of sword that is not the kind of sword that Paul was writing about this is what he would have seen on every single soldier's hip attached to their belt was the Roman Gladius the Roman sword was light only around two pounds short and designed to be wielded easily with one hand while the other hand grasped the shield its size meant it could be drawn in close quarters and its sharpened edges made it a threat to any enemy who got close Roman soldiers were trained to use the Gladius in tandem with the scutum or Shield the Gladius was mainly used for making quick thrusts or short slashes from around the scutum thus providing the soldier with the most protection possible they were trained to fight with the shield in front of them and just be reaching around and giving a quick stab or a quick slash and immediately pulling back behind their Shield again so that they kept the least amount of flesh out for the enemy to be striking at they were staying behind the shield as much as possible they would strike and immediately pull back strike again pull back The Shield stayed in the front The Shield stayed there as the protection but they could fight out as necessary Hebrews chapter 4 and verse 12. for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart if you would pull that picture back up an infantryman in the Roman legion would also go into battle with a dagger a few Spears possibly a few darts which was a type of throwing spear but the Gladius was the only offensive weapon that was talked about by Paul it was also the main weapon in a soldier's Arsenal they might go into battle with these other things but this was the one they would rely on the most with Paul talking about the sword as the only weapon carried in the Christian's Arsenal Paul is making it clear that the sword of the spirit which is the word of God is the only weapon that we need to take on the enemy he didn't say all right here's your sword and then here's your dagger and here's your this that is no this is it this is all you need he knew the Roman soldiers carried more he had seen them marching around enough to know they had other weapons They Carried but Paul made sure to write about one this is it I don't need to try to stack you up with other weapons for long range for this for that it's this is what you have this is what you need the word of God covers it all it handles everything it will handle every attack of the enemy you don't need anything else he made it clear that the only weapon you need is the sword of the spirit which is the word of God in the sermon hearing ye him brother random says and the word of God will defeat the enemy any place anywhere at any time all the great power of God was in Christ he was God bodily God in Christ reconciling the world to himself but when he met Satan he never used any of his powers when Satan met him he said now if you're a miracle performer if you're the Son of God do a miracle here before me turn these stones to bread Jesus never used his power he used the father's word he said it's written man shall not live by bread alone then Satan came around and wanted to debate with him so he used the father's words too but he misused it put in the wrong place and Jesus said it is also written and every time Satan would come at him he'd speak with the father's word and defeated Satan on the father's word and you can do the same thing if you'll believe God's word and stand on God's word it'll defeat Satan every time so you have the loins Gert with truth this thick heavy belt that your other armor is fastened to that provides the stability we have to start with truth there's it can't be fast into falsehood you have to have the truth of God's word to begin with everything the breastplate of righteousness that attaches to that belt that you can strap down tightly that covers all the main areas that the enemy would try to attack the righteousness you living what's right doing what's right doing the things that God's instructing you to do feet shot with the gospel of peace so that you can stand on any terrain that comes along no matter what kind of trial what kind of test no matter what kind of mountain you're going through what kind of valley you have the peace to be able to tread through it it has the spikes on it that will dig into the ground it has the thick Souls that'll stand up to the rocks that you may be walking on you can go through the marshes you can go through the rivers you can go through the streams and the things of the world aren't going to cling to you they're able to run right out as you keep on walking and you keep on fighting because you can go through this terrain and you can handle whatever comes because you have the peace that's God given you to stand and to face the terrain you have the shield of Faith which is really the main defense the faith that you hold up that has been soaked in the water of the word that we've made sure that there's plenty of water plenty of word on it so that when the enemy's darts are coming at they're all going to be quenched and we can interlock those Shields with our brothers and sisters to defend each other that were more powerful standing together not alone but when we fight in formation side by side watching over each other is when we're at our best it's when we're able to be the mighty conquering Army moving forward the helmet of salvation that covers the head so that you can keep going and that is there for when you let that Faith slip a little bit when the enemy is able to get a blow in because that Faith dropped just a little it doesn't take away the Salvation the Salvation is still there to protect you to take the blow and you are able to recover and lift that Faith back up go okay I shouldn't shouldn't have dropped there should have kept that up and then we have the sword of the spirit which is the word of God which is what allows us to fight and to overcome every single thing that the enemy throws at us when the Army's put together they make sure to equip them with the best gear that they can and God looked and said okay this is my Army this is what you're going to be fighting so this is what I'm equipping you with this is what I'm making sure so that you can stand every test that comes along you can face every adversary you can fight against every trial against every test and you have the armor to protect you you have the weapon to fight back and I don't give you more than you need I didn't say oh you have to have all these different weapons that you have to learn it's no you've got the one you just have to learn to handle this use the word of God use the sword of the spirit that's what you use to fight the enemy it's just the one choice I don't have to think about should I use a bow here should I use a dagger here should I use a spear should I use swords no I have a sword this is what I use my captain equipped me he gave me what I need and this is how I'm gonna fight the enemy and this is how I'm going to overcome if the musicians will go ahead and come in the sermon faith without works is Den brother random says this that is the initial way of Divine Healing you know that the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere anytime on any conditions is that right when Jesus was here on Earth all the great gifts there was in heaven he had them right with him what the father was he was for he was God the son here on Earth God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself you believe that but when he met Satan he never used any of those powers he taken the father's word Satan said now if that question mark over the word of God again if thou be the Son of God command these stones to be made bread he said it is written man shall not live by bread alone right with the word take him up and when he tried to whitewash the word make it some other way he said it's written it's also written right back with the word of God tying Satan and then he taken him up onto the mountain showed him all the kingdoms of the world United States and all said these are all mine I'll give them to you if you'll fall down and worship me Jesus said it is written back to the father's word again none of his power just using the word showing that the weakest of Christians can defeat Satan on thus saith the Lord taking God at his word is that right and convinced and then concerned God to his army that he know in every nation tries to equip their army with the best they must do it to survive and God equipping his army being infinite know the best armor that there was and what did he do he give his army the word we're not fortified behind denomination we're not fortified behind groups we're fortified by the word of God and one last one and putting on the whole armor of God here's some time ago in the Army when our nation first provided a helmet oh my that little rookie didn't want to wear that it seemed unnecessary but when he got in battle he needed it God don't provide anything unless he has need of it everything that he provides for you you better take it because you're going to have need of it a little rookie with a 90 pound pack on his back in training he's got his new suit on you know he don't see any necessary packing that 90 pound pack with all these pick shovels hand grenades everything else but let him get in battle once time will come when you must have it that's right that's why the always God equipped his army with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he know these intellectual Giants would stand in this last day he know they'd stand and they'd be able to explain by their great wisdom powers of Satan Peter said they're like roaring lion defiring what we will but he said I'm not going to leave you comfortless I'm coming again I'm going to be with you he equipped his army with the baptism the Holy Ghost said go up there every one of you and wait behold I send the promise of my father upon you but Terry ye in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high after this the Holy Ghost has come upon you then you shall be Witnesses of me Jerusalem Judea Plum on down to the uttermost parts of the world [Music] I know this wasn't anything amazing or earth-shattering this wasn't a lot of this is things that we've heard over the years we've heard about the armor of God and we've talked about it this wasn't the kind of sermon where it's going I'm going to put everyone on conviction and they're going to end up the altar but maybe it's just a little reminder how God takes care of us and how he equips Us and how we make sure that we have everything that we need to face the trials and tests that are coming along I don't know what trial and tests each one of you is facing I don't know what's going on in every single person's life but by the authority of the word I can tell you God's given you what you need God's equipped you he's given you the right armor he's given you the right weapon so that you can face whatever's going on [Music] that's it that's as deep as it gets is God's giving you what you need he's equipped you to stand the test he's equipped you to make it through and he's equipped you to fight all the way to Glory he didn't forget to give us something he's not looking down going man I wish I'd given them a dagger I wish I'd given them a bow he gave us everything we need to face the trials [Music] and that should just make us want to rejoice let's stand and go ahead and worship really Colby what are we gonna sing [Music] the name of Jesus we've got the power In The Name Of The
