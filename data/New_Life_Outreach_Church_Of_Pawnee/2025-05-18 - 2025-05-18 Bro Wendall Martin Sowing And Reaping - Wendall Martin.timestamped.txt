[13:18] Oh, now I see a cloud like a
[13:24] man. And I
[13:26] know it's going to
[13:30] rain. At the time when it was dry, not a
[13:35] cloud in the sky, the children of God
[13:39] began to reason why.
[13:44] So they went to God's man cuz they
[13:47] didn't
[13:49] understand. Go look. It's written in the
[13:53] sky. Oh my. Well, now I see a cloud like

[14:20] rain. So they opened up the door. The
[14:24] seventh time they looked once more, a
[14:28] tiny cloud was rising from the sea.
[14:33] Will they begin to
[14:35] understand that a heavy rain was at
[14:38] hand? Just like
[14:41] God said it would
[14:44] be. Oh, now I see a
[14:49] cloud. Yes, I do. Oh, now I see a cloud
[14:55] like a man's hand.
[14:58] Oh, now I see a cloud like a man's
[15:03] hand and I
[15:05] know it's going to
[15:09] rain. So today we have no fear. We know
[15:14] a cloud did appear. The scream prophet
[15:18] brought through that
[15:21] door. Oh, have faith and just believe.
[15:25] God's spirit. You'll receive the
[15:30] rain. It's going to pour. Do you believe
[15:32] that tonight? Oh, I see a cloud.

[15:44] man's head. Is there one more verse? I
[15:47] see a cloud.

[15:54] know it's going to rain. I love this.
[15:59] Now the bride is looking above for a
[16:02] cherry rain of love to heal their hearts
[16:06] with peace they've never
[16:10] known. And soon this bride shall be
[16:14] God's unfolding mystery.

[36:26] wings before my

[39:03] way in
[39:07] [Music]
[39:09] me.
[39:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[39:14] We love you, Lord
[39:16] Jesus. We thank the Lord for his grace
[39:19] upon our lives. Amen. He is so
[39:23] wonderful. We uh sure enjoyed that song,
[39:27] Sister Hannah. And um isn't
[39:31] she's a she's just a beautiful singer, a
[39:34] beautiful person inside, outside. We
[39:37] just love sister uh sister Hannah and
[39:41] we've been privileged to watch her grow
[39:43] up, you know, and naturally and
[39:46] spiritually and and so we're just so
[39:48] glad. I I forgot to recognize you this
[39:51] morning and but we're so glad to have
[39:53] you tonight. And uh God is God is good.
[39:57] It's just good to have so many uh
[39:59] wonderful friends and and one of these
[40:02] days um uh there won't be no no parting
[40:06] ways. We'll all be together and and
[40:10] it'll be a wonderful thing. And um so
[40:14] we're glad to see uh brother John uh
[40:17] Kobe and and Sister Mary uh back with us
[40:20] this evening. and
[40:23] um missed them here this this morning
[40:26] and uh I heard the service there in
[40:28] Claremore was wonderful and so we're
[40:30] sure uh thankful to the Lord for that.
[40:33] Uh we're not going to keep you standing.
[40:35] Let's look here in Galatians the 6th
[40:37] chapter, the 7th verse. And um uh we
[40:43] um won't won't keep you too long here
[40:46] this evening.
[40:49] Um we want to speak a little bit on
[40:53] uh just continuing our thoughts. Uh
[40:57] there's an art in in overcoming. When we
[41:00] say that there is a a method, there is
[41:03] there is a way that we overcome and
[41:07] there's a there's simple things in our
[41:09] lives that we can that that that we can
[41:12] really tap into. And so tonight I want
[41:14] to uh deal with sewing and reaping and
[41:18] and some of these little little tidbits
[41:21] here is just so important in overcoming.
[41:25] And so we we dealt with um love on
[41:30] Wednesday night. And then this morning
[41:33] we we came in just a little bit further
[41:36] on our love back to him. It was God's
[41:38] love Wednesday night. Now it's our love
[41:40] back to him.
[41:42] and and
[41:44] and working out of love. Everything is
[41:48] the necessity. When the Holy Spirit
[41:51] comes into your heart, it's a necessity
[41:52] to please him. It's your desire to
[41:54] please him. There's nothing else that
[41:56] matters to you. And so tonight, we want
[41:59] to just deal with with sewing and
[42:01] reaping. So, let's look here in
[42:02] Galatians 6 and 7. Be not
[42:06] deceived. God is not mocked. For
[42:10] whatsoever a man
[42:12] sws, that shall he also reap. For if he
[42:16] for he that sweth to his flesh shall of
[42:19] the flesh reap corruption. But he that
[42:22] sweth to the spirit, in other words,
[42:24] that's that's the capital S. Amen. To
[42:27] the spirit of God shall of the spirit
[42:29] reap life everlasting. Let us not be
[42:32] weary in welloing, for in due season we
[42:35] shall reap if we faint not. As we have
[42:38] therefore opportunity, let us do good
[42:40] unto all men, especially unto them who
[42:44] are of the household of faith. Let's go
[42:46] to the Lord in prayer. Father, we just
[42:48] want to thank you today for your
[42:50] blessings. And Lord, I I loved both of
[42:53] those specials. Uh, Brother Caleb's
[42:56] special tonight and sister Hannah. We
[42:59] just ask a real special blessing upon
[43:01] them. We appreciate your presence here
[43:04] this evening. Now Lord, I just ask that
[43:06] you would come in a real uh specific and
[43:10] special way and that you would speak to
[43:13] our hearts to each heart individually.
[43:15] Father, we've come because we want to
[43:18] hear from you. We love you with all of
[43:20] our heart in Jesus name we pray. Can the
[43:24] church say amen and amen? God bless you.
[43:27] You may be seated here this evening.
[43:30] Amen.
[43:32] So sewing the right kind of
[43:34] seeds it's it's a you you want to
[43:40] um I think it's important that we do sew
[43:43] the right kind of seeds and um you sew
[43:48] in prayer then you reap amen you reap in
[43:51] prayer you you you you reap the answers
[43:54] you sew in mercy you'll reap mercy man
[43:58] Jesus said there in Matthew 5:7 blessed
[44:01] are the mercy merciful for they shall
[44:04] receive mercy. Amen. So it's it's mercy.
[44:09] Seeds of mercy bring back fruit of
[44:13] mercy. So the reason that that a farmer
[44:17] plants seeds in the ground is so that he
[44:21] can have a harvest. Amen. So we want
[44:24] those seeds sewn in the ground. If you
[44:26] don't sew the seeds into the ground,
[44:29] then you're not going to have a harvest.
[44:31] Amen. You can't blame You can't blame uh
[44:35] the president. You can't blame the the
[44:38] the governor. You can't blame anybody
[44:41] else. If you are not sewing seeds,
[44:44] you're not going to get a crop. You say,
[44:47] "I want watermelon, and I don't know why
[44:50] the farmer next door is getting
[44:52] watermelon." and and and that's not
[44:55] fair. He's got watermelon. My neighbor
[44:58] in the next door, he's got watermelon
[45:01] and I ain't got no watermelon. And you
[45:04] can blame everybody about it. But if you
[45:06] are not sewing seeds of watermelon, then
[45:11] you're not going to benefit from the
[45:13] fruit of watermelon. Amen. So, you've
[45:16] got to sew the seed if you're planning
[45:20] on it. Well, praise the Lord. So, if you
[45:24] want to receive anything, you've got to
[45:28] put into it. Well, well, you know, why
[45:31] why do they, man? They just they're just
[45:33] so lucky. Amen. As the world would say,
[45:36] lucky. I don't believe in luck, but they
[45:38] say it's lucky. Lucky. They've got a
[45:40] nice house. They've got a nice car.
[45:42] They've got a nice They got a
[45:43] good-looking woman. They've got a Amen.
[45:45] Well, you you've got to sew the right
[45:48] kind of seeds. You got to get out, go to
[45:50] work. Amen. So that you can receive some
[45:53] money. So you've got to sew in labor and
[45:57] you receive in money. Hallelujah. That's
[46:00] the way it works. Amen. So So we God's
[46:04] not a food stamp guy. That's that's not
[46:06] invented by God. That was that that is
[46:09] that is invented by humanity to help
[46:11] people who who get in trouble on an
[46:14] occasion. It was not something that we
[46:16] were to live by. It was not something
[46:18] Amen. But if you get in a bind sometime
[46:20] and you got sometimes we need charity
[46:23] and charity is a one and we all have to
[46:26] have charity from time to time. Amen.
[46:28] But that is not God's intention for our
[46:32] lives. It's sowing and reaping. That's
[46:35] the very first law that God put into
[46:38] action. Amen. At the beginning after he
[46:41] made all of the creation, he said now,
[46:44] Amen. He says now, Amen. Let every seed
[46:48] let every seed yield of its kind. So the
[46:52] apple seed is going to is going to to
[46:55] give us apple uh an apple tree, apple
[46:58] fruit. Amen. Uh cucumber seeds produce
[47:02] watermelons. A no, they produce Amen.
[47:05] They produce of its kind. So if you're
[47:08] going to if you want righteousness, then
[47:12] you've got to soul righteousness, right?
[47:16] Okay. If you want a happy marriage, then
[47:19] you cannot sow pornography.
[47:23] When you sow pornography, you're going
[47:26] to have a very unhealthy marriage. Amen.
[47:30] And the statistics show that you're
[47:31] going to end up in divorce.
[47:34] Amen. If if you're wanting if you're
[47:37] wanting a a a happy wife, then you've
[47:40] got to sew the right seeds into that
[47:44] woman to make her feel make her know
[47:47] that she is your number one. And guys,
[47:50] we need to let our wives know that they
[47:53] are the number one in our lives.
[47:57] Amen. So, sewing the right kind of
[47:59] seeds. I want to sew I want to sew the
[48:03] seeds. Amen. that is going to give me
[48:05] the right crop. Now, I don't know of any
[48:08] farmer that wants to go out and sew a
[48:11] and sew uh thistles. Amen. And and and
[48:15] thorns and they they I don't know of
[48:16] anyone says, "Oh man, harvest or sewing
[48:20] time is coming." Amen. I'm going to get
[48:22] out there and I'm going to sew thorns
[48:24] and thistles and I'm going to put those
[48:27] out there and I can't wait for my crop
[48:29] that I have never in my life. Amen. And
[48:32] this is and and I've been around farming
[48:35] and ranching, but I've never heard
[48:36] anyone say that. Amen. What do they want
[48:39] to do? You want to sew seeds that you
[48:43] can benefit from. Seow wheat seeds so
[48:46] you can have bread. Amen. Sew barley so
[48:48] you can have bread. Amen. And the
[48:51] necessities. Sew cotton you can sew.
[48:53] Amen. You sew these things so that you
[48:56] can reap the benefits of the seeds that
[48:59] you are sewing. Amen. So that means you
[49:03] need to know what you're sewing. You
[49:05] need to pay attention to what you're
[49:07] sewing. And you need to pay attention to
[49:09] the kind of ground you're sewing it in.
[49:11] Because I promise you, if you sew the
[49:15] wrong kind of seeds, you can set belly
[49:18] ache and cry all you want, but you're
[49:22] going to get a harvest.
[49:27] It's going to happen. That's a law that
[49:29] God put into action. Amen. Way before
[49:32] the fall. Satan has come in and
[49:34] perverted it. And now he's got all kinds
[49:36] of seeds. Amen. But I want to tell you,
[49:39] if you sew the right kind of seed,
[49:41] you're going to have the right kind of
[49:43] crop.
[49:45] Can you say amen? Amen. So blessed.
[49:48] Amen. So you as the scripture says,
[49:50] blessed are the merciful, for they shall
[49:52] receive mercy. Amen. Jesus al also said
[49:55] there in Luke 6:37 it says, "Judge not
[49:58] that you be not judged. Condemn not that
[50:00] you and and and ye shall not be
[50:02] condemned. Forgive and you shall be
[50:05] given uh uh forgiven. Give and it shall
[50:08] be given unto you. Good measure pressed
[50:11] down, shaken together, running over
[50:14] shall men give unto your bosom. For with
[50:16] the same measure that you met wi meet
[50:18] wittlele, it shall be measured to you
[50:21] again." Now, what he's trying what he's
[50:23] saying in good old uh everyday English
[50:25] is Amen. The same thing that you give
[50:28] out, the same thing that you you're
[50:30] going to receive it in abundance.
[50:34] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Now, if you
[50:38] sow into your so sin into your life,
[50:42] then you're going to receive disaster in
[50:46] your life. Amen. that John uh Romans 8
[50:49] or 6:23 for the wages of sin is death.
[50:54] Proverbs 22 and8 he that sweth iniquity
[50:58] shall reap vanity. Job 4:8 even as I
[51:02] have seen they that plow iniquity and
[51:06] sow wickedness reap the same. So if we
[51:10] if we're going to sew sin, sew in in
[51:14] unrighteousness, sew in those things in
[51:17] those seeds that Satan has has brought
[51:19] out today. I I Hey, listen. I I don't
[51:22] believe there was thorns and thistles
[51:23] when God says, "Let every seed produce
[51:25] of its kind." Amen. The thorns and
[51:28] thistles came after the fall, but Amen.
[51:32] But they are now seeds. So there are
[51:35] there are good seeds. There are evil
[51:38] seeds that we can plant. Amen. And
[51:41] there's going to be an evil crop and
[51:42] there's going to be a good crop to
[51:44] receive.
[51:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, Hosea Hosea 10
[51:50] and 12 says, "Sow to yourselves in
[51:54] righteousness and reap in mercy. break
[51:58] up the your fow ground. For it is time
[52:01] to seek the Lord till he come and reign
[52:05] righteousness upon you. You have plowed
[52:08] wickedness and you have reaped iniquity.
[52:12] You have eaten the fruit of lies because
[52:15] thou did trust in thy way, your own way,
[52:19] in the multitude of thy mighty men.
[52:22] Amen. So, so we we we we've got it here.
[52:25] He says, "If you sow righteousness, then
[52:28] you'll reap in mercy. Break up the fow
[52:31] ground of your heart and you can receive
[52:34] just as this farmer on this side of you
[52:36] and that farmer on that side of you. But
[52:39] you've chosen to plow in wickedness and
[52:43] you have reaped iniquity. You are eating
[52:47] the fruit of
[52:49] lies because you received those things
[52:53] into your life. Can you say amen? Amen.
[52:57] Brother Brandham would say in the Hebrew
[52:58] series, he would say, "Well, we can't
[53:01] backslide." Amen. He says, "Well, we
[53:04] can't backslide." And he says,
[53:05] "Absolutely. And when you backslide,
[53:07] you're going to get it. Don't you worry.
[53:10] Abraham got it. And the rest of them got
[53:13] it. You'll get it. Don't you think it
[53:16] gives you a right to sin? It doesn't.
[53:19] You'll pay for everything you do. You'll
[53:23] reap what you sow. You do one little sin
[53:28] and you'll reap a whole wash tub full.
[53:31] That's right. But brother, that don't
[53:33] mean to say that you're lost. That's
[53:35] exactly right. Abraham reaped exactly
[53:38] what he sold and and and was still
[53:40] saved. Amen. So you can you can be a
[53:43] believer and sewing the wrong seeds in
[53:46] your life and and you're going and and
[53:49] and you can be a miserable
[53:51] cre. Well, praise the Lord. Amen. Amen.
[53:55] So, sewing the right seeds. Amen. Now,
[53:58] you're a spirit being. So, a spirit
[54:01] being, how how do we sew the right seeds
[54:05] as spirit beings? How do we receive
[54:07] seeds? And this is something I want to I
[54:09] want to deal with two areas as ju just
[54:11] quickly here tonight. Amen. I I want to
[54:14] deal want to cover two areas. Number
[54:16] one, allowing seeds to be planted in
[54:19] your mind and heart. And then you
[54:22] planting the seeds you it is important
[54:25] that the seeds that you allow in your
[54:28] mind. Now you say you say now now what
[54:30] are seeds? Jesus said amen my words are
[54:35] the seeds. Now he all he gave a parable.
[54:38] I we don't have time to read it here but
[54:40] he gave the parable that there was a
[54:42] good man that come in and swed seeds in
[54:45] in in the in the earth. And then there
[54:48] was a an evil man come in at nighttime.
[54:52] Amen. Under the disguise of darkness.
[54:54] And he swed seeds. A and then the they
[54:58] found that the bad seeds were in there.
[55:00] And and and and they said, "Well, should
[55:02] we go pluck up all the little seeds?" He
[55:05] says, "Nope. Excuse me. Let them grow
[55:07] together." Amen. And so they asked him.
[55:10] He said, "Well, what what are what are
[55:11] these
[55:12] seeds?" He says, "These seeds that were
[55:15] sown were my word." And then Satan come
[55:19] and sold his word. That's exactly what
[55:22] happened in the Garden of Eden. God
[55:24] sowed his seed, amen, into the into the
[55:27] heart and mind of Adam and Eve. But then
[55:30] Satan sowed his seed into the womb of of
[55:35] uh of Eve's heart. Amen. She accepted
[55:40] that seed into her heart long time
[55:43] before she committed adultery. All
[55:45] right. Brother Brandham says that she
[55:48] accepted Satan's words in her mind and
[55:52] heart and that was where the sin
[55:55] happened before the natural act ever
[55:57] took place. Amen. So seeds are
[56:00] important. What you hear, what you
[56:04] receive is important. Amen. You receive
[56:07] you receive gossip. Amen. You you're
[56:10] you're you're going to take away your
[56:12] faith. You're going to take away your
[56:13] love. Amen. You you receive you you
[56:16] receive things into your life. Amen.
[56:19] That is that is not of God. You you
[56:21] you're going to receive those things.
[56:23] Amen. It's going to take Now, what is a
[56:25] seed? It's a flowering plant. It's a
[56:28] flowering plant's unit of reproduction.
[56:30] Amen. Capable of developing into another
[56:33] such plant. Another one is uh the cause
[56:36] of the hidden beginning of a feeling or
[56:37] or uh let's see here. Um,
[56:41] it's
[56:43] Hallelujah. Amen. Um, I don't have the
[56:46] other deal here, but anyways, it's the
[56:48] cause or the hidden beginning of a
[56:50] feeling or process or condition. So,
[56:53] you've got a seed that's when the
[56:54] natural seed, but then words can come in
[56:58] and they and they will begin what
[57:00] happens in a little bitty seed, amen,
[57:02] will be will will be the beginning of a
[57:05] feeling or a process or a condition.
[57:08] Conversations. seow tiny seeds. Amen.
[57:11] You you you you have you're not having a
[57:14] the the right kind of of of uh uh
[57:18] uh your friends you hang around matter
[57:21] so much because conversations will sew
[57:25] seeds of faith or it'll sew seeds of
[57:27] doubt. It can cause it can sew seeds of
[57:30] of confusion and frustration or it can
[57:33] show seeds of amen of victory in your
[57:36] life. So, so your kind of friends that
[57:39] you have, who you run with, who you who
[57:42] you fellowship with, you cannot be a
[57:46] Christian, a successful Christian, and
[57:49] then and then uh uh have friends that
[57:53] are outside of faith because they are
[57:56] going to be sewing into your life.
[58:00] Hey, there's people there's people even
[58:02] in in in in in church. Amen. Even in
[58:06] this church, I I Amen. They they lean a
[58:08] little bit more on the depressed side. I
[58:10] have to watch how much seeds I accept
[58:14] from them in my life. I'm talking about
[58:17] new life. Amen. Because I don't want
[58:20] that little something in in in to come
[58:24] and take a root in my heart.
[58:28] I want seeds of faith and faith alone.
[58:33] Well, praise the Lord. You say, "Man,
[58:35] you're saying that of your own church?"
[58:36] Well, yes. Hallelujah. Amen. I I've got
[58:40] to guard my heart. I must keep seeds of
[58:45] faith and faith alone.
[58:48] Can you say amen? Amen. But there are
[58:51] others in my life that are my go-to.
[58:54] Amen. And what I mean by that, when I'm
[58:57] in my when I'm in my dark time and and I
[59:00] and I'm not seeing clearly and I come in
[59:03] and I I just start spewing stuff myself.
[59:07] Hallelujah. Amen. First of all, I find a
[59:11] confidant that is that is not going to
[59:13] sit there and listen to my junk and and
[59:16] pity me. They're they're going to listen
[59:18] to my junk. And the reason I'm going to
[59:21] them is so they can slap me silly and
[59:24] tell me you need to get your head on
[59:26] straight, boy.
[59:28] Well, praise the Lord. I'll do it. Amen.
[59:31] When when my head gets fuzzy. And when
[59:33] it seems like Satan's trying to plant
[59:35] those seeds, I'll find somebody of
[59:38] faith. I'm not going to find somebody
[59:40] that's you want to Amen. that that's on
[59:42] the same playing level I am. I'm needing
[59:44] someone to sew into my life. I'm needing
[59:48] seeds of life to be sown in my heart.
[59:53] Hallelujah. Aren't don't Aren't you glad
[59:56] that you've got people that you can go
[59:58] to and say, "Sow some seeds in me." I'm
[1:00:01] discouraged right now. Seow some seeds.
[1:00:03] Amen. And we shouldn't be one of those
[1:00:05] kind of guys that's a constantly on the
[1:00:07] receiving end. You ought to have that
[1:00:10] kind of a heart. I don't want to just be
[1:00:11] a welfare Christian. I want to sew some
[1:00:14] seeds in my heart and sew some seeds
[1:00:16] into somebody else's heart.
[1:00:20] Well, praise the Lord. Amen. So, we we
[1:00:23] got to have those seeds. Amen. Seeds of
[1:00:27] of encouragement. Seeds of hey, God's
[1:00:30] word will come to pass. Seeds of I know
[1:00:33] it's dark time right now, but God's
[1:00:35] going to see you through. seeds of I I
[1:00:38] know you're in the trial of your life
[1:00:41] and I know the circumstance and I know
[1:00:44] that Satan's trying to make you bitter,
[1:00:46] but brother, don't you allow that. Amen.
[1:00:49] I'm going to sew seeds of mercy in you.
[1:00:52] I'm going to sew seeds of faith in you.
[1:00:55] And what does that do? I go to somebody
[1:00:59] who can help me. Amen. and and sew those
[1:01:03] seeds because those seeds from that
[1:01:05] little conversation will last a
[1:01:08] lifetime.
[1:01:10] That's right. It'll last a lifetime. So
[1:01:14] watching what we allow in our heart is
[1:01:18] so important
[1:01:20] because the word seed is the genesis.
[1:01:25] Amen. God's word seed is the genesis.
[1:01:27] It's the beginning. It's the it's it's
[1:01:30] what? It's the originator. Amen. And
[1:01:33] God, Satan has a a a word seed and he
[1:01:38] will do he wants a genesis. Amen. That's
[1:01:42] exactly how Cain got here is because
[1:01:44] there was another seed that was planted.
[1:01:47] Amen. And so we we we we want to watch
[1:01:51] now because the action thoughts and
[1:01:54] actions are seeds which in turn causes
[1:01:57] something to develop. Amen. And the kind
[1:02:00] of crop depends on the kind of seed that
[1:02:03] is developed. Now I I want to before we
[1:02:07] get get too too much further, I want I
[1:02:10] want to talk to you young people. when
[1:02:12] you see sinners or uh when you see uh I
[1:02:15] don't know evil men and women in the
[1:02:17] world or you see you you you see people
[1:02:20] that are that that are bound by
[1:02:22] addictions or they're bound by I want
[1:02:25] you to remember that there was a there
[1:02:28] was a time when that happened there was
[1:02:31] some seeds that were accepted sewn in
[1:02:33] their lives and it was accepted now it
[1:02:36] could have been that there were seeds
[1:02:38] sewn into into that child amen by a
[1:02:41] mother and father, sister Sister
[1:02:43] Stephanie Green has has told us some of
[1:02:45] her story and the things that Amen. And
[1:02:48] it was just passed on from her from from
[1:02:50] her mother and and and sewn into her
[1:02:53] life until when she was 12 years old.
[1:02:56] She was doing some hard drugs. Amen.
[1:02:59] Used to do them right there with her
[1:03:00] mother. Mom was sewing into her life.
[1:03:03] And because of that, Amen. She was an
[1:03:05] addict, a heroin addict for more than 20
[1:03:08] years. And and and when she come to the
[1:03:11] church here, she was living homeless.
[1:03:13] They they didn't they didn't have a
[1:03:15] home. She was as skinny as skinny could
[1:03:17] be. Why? Somebody sewn seeds into the
[1:03:22] innocent fertile ground and there she
[1:03:25] become.
[1:03:27] Amen. But thank God for mercy. Amen.
[1:03:30] Because God sewing some seeds and we've
[1:03:32] seen what God done for our sister
[1:03:34] Stephanie.
[1:03:36] Do do you understand? So, a lot of those
[1:03:38] kinds of things and it and it's sad and
[1:03:40] I'm sure brother Nathaniel could could
[1:03:42] tell you all kinds of stories that of
[1:03:44] parents sewing uh evil seeds into their
[1:03:46] par into their lives. But then there's
[1:03:49] then there's those of us that are in
[1:03:50] raised in church. Amen. And you're sort
[1:03:53] of shielded from the things of the world
[1:03:56] and and you but those devils are still
[1:03:59] there and and and those those Satan will
[1:04:02] come in with thoughts. He'll come with
[1:04:04] an outside magazine. He'll come with an
[1:04:07] outside uh something that you see on the
[1:04:09] phone. These are seeds that are being
[1:04:12] sown in your mind. And that's where
[1:04:14] you've got to reject those seeds right
[1:04:17] now. Don't accept those seeds. Reject
[1:04:19] them right now.
[1:04:21] Can you say amen?
[1:04:24] Amen. A drunkard wasn't always a drunk.
[1:04:27] Amen. The girl that's going from man to
[1:04:29] man wasn't always that way. There there
[1:04:32] there was there wasn't there was a
[1:04:34] beginning. There was a seed planted in
[1:04:37] that life and it produced what you see
[1:04:41] today.
[1:04:48] You you boys and girls that are you
[1:04:50] young married couples, you that are
[1:04:52] somebody swed seeds of eternal life in
[1:04:55] you and you accepted those seeds and God
[1:04:58] has shielded you from the devourer. All
[1:05:02] right. God has given you his
[1:05:05] blessings. Come on now. It's because mom
[1:05:08] and dad, the preacher, the Sunday school
[1:05:10] teacher has been sewing seeds into your
[1:05:14] life and those seeds have come up. Now,
[1:05:18] when you get of age, you've got to make
[1:05:20] that you've got to make that choice.
[1:05:22] I've told this many of times. Amen. We
[1:05:24] we were raised without a TV. Mom and dad
[1:05:27] were very were very strong. My mother
[1:05:29] was a very uh strongly convicted about
[1:05:31] those kinds of things in the home and
[1:05:34] and and and what she would wanted us
[1:05:36] kids to hear. My dad was a uh she was a
[1:05:38] praying woman. My dad was a God-fearing
[1:05:40] man and and was not going to allow us.
[1:05:44] Amen. Uh uh that that kind of stuff in
[1:05:47] our home. Amen. And and you could always
[1:05:50] tell all of us Amen. we were Pentecostal
[1:05:52] back then. You could all tell all of us
[1:05:54] Pentecostal apostolic Amen. When we went
[1:05:56] to Walmart, it it was funny. All the all
[1:05:59] the Pentecostals from around the area
[1:06:01] that didn't have TVs, all of the kids
[1:06:02] were all lined up in front of the TVs.
[1:06:04] Amen. And uh
[1:06:07] uh and so uh we we got married and I
[1:06:11] said, "You know what? I am the man of my
[1:06:12] house now. Hallelujah. We're going to
[1:06:15] get us a TV." And my wife says, "I don't
[1:06:18] like that idea. I was raised with a TV
[1:06:20] and I don't want a TV in my house." And
[1:06:22] and Wendle, I just it just I don't want
[1:06:24] those seeds. needs. I don't want to even
[1:06:26] get that started when our kids come
[1:06:27] along. And I said, "Well, as the head of
[1:06:29] the house, I'm going to bring a TV in
[1:06:30] the house." Hallelujah. So, we we we
[1:06:32] brought a TV in the house. Amen. And I
[1:06:35] would sit there and I said, "Come on,
[1:06:36] mama. Let's go. Come over here." Uh
[1:06:38] well, she wasn't mama then. Come on,
[1:06:39] baby. Uh uh I I I I hear some of those
[1:06:42] cute words that uh Austin says to his
[1:06:45] wife and and I had a few of those cute
[1:06:47] words myself. You know, Jonathan used to
[1:06:49] he used to call uh you're my sweet pee
[1:06:51] or something like that to Laura. How did
[1:06:53] that go? And so, um, I'd say, "Baby,
[1:06:56] come on over here." And so, uh, uh, but
[1:06:58] she would say, "No, I don't I don't want
[1:06:59] to sit there. I I've known what it's
[1:07:01] about. I don't I don't want that stuff
[1:07:03] in my mind." But when the kids come
[1:07:05] around, I begin to I begin to notice,
[1:07:08] and I noticed myself, I was no longer
[1:07:11] wanting to go out. Amen. And and I
[1:07:14] didn't have the desire as much to get
[1:07:16] out and win the loss, uh, preach on the
[1:07:18] street corners or doing those things
[1:07:19] anymore. When I'd come home from work,
[1:07:21] I'd say, "Come on, let's watch a movie."
[1:07:23] And before you know it, one movie night
[1:07:24] and the next movie night and the next
[1:07:26] movie night. But what I found is those
[1:07:29] spirits, there were spirits that were on
[1:07:32] those images and on those words. I found
[1:07:35] out that it wasn't a it's not it's not
[1:07:38] someone saying, "Amen, this here." That
[1:07:40] that TV will not take you to hell.
[1:07:45] That's true. And neither will your
[1:07:47] phone. Hallelujah.
[1:07:49] But it's the things on that TV. It's the
[1:07:53] spirits that come in that TV. And it's
[1:07:56] the words that you hear that are sewing
[1:08:00] seeds in your heart.
[1:08:04] Right? And what seemed to be
[1:08:08] innocent were
[1:08:10] seeds. And I could walk away from that
[1:08:13] TV and not feel anything. But they were
[1:08:16] seeds that begin to grow. That's right.
[1:08:18] Amen. Hallelujah. And it's the same way
[1:08:21] with your phones or anything else today.
[1:08:24] Amen. The things that you see the are
[1:08:26] seeds that are coming and what you read,
[1:08:29] what you hear, the music you listen to,
[1:08:32] those are seeds that you are planting or
[1:08:35] allowing to be planted in your life. I
[1:08:38] think we need we need to set up some
[1:08:41] Amen. And we we we we need to uh uh uh
[1:08:44] uh uh set up some guard over what is
[1:08:47] going to come into our minds and our
[1:08:49] hearts. Amen. What you plant in your
[1:08:52] ground is going It might take a while,
[1:08:55] young man. What you are looking at right
[1:08:57] now, it might seem innocent. You might I
[1:08:59] I've been told, "Oh, there Oh, brother
[1:09:01] Window, I know you don't understand
[1:09:03] that, but we'll all understand one of
[1:09:05] these days." Amen. what I'm doing. I
[1:09:07] know I know you don't want me to do it
[1:09:10] and I know you're saying the B and I
[1:09:12] know and I said it's not whether I'm
[1:09:15] right or wrong or you're right or wrong.
[1:09:17] It's the seed that you're allowing and
[1:09:19] it will destroy you.
[1:09:25] Amen. And the seed did grow and the seed
[1:09:28] did
[1:09:29] destroy. It's because the seeds were
[1:09:32] planted. Somebody wasn't being faithful
[1:09:36] to guard their garden. Amen.
[1:09:40] So I think we need to be careful at the
[1:09:43] garden that we that we allow or what we
[1:09:46] allow in our garden. Brother Random says
[1:09:48] when you smoke when you smoke the first
[1:09:50] that first cigarette and thought mother
[1:09:52] would smell it on your breath and you
[1:09:55] took some coffee and grains and chewed
[1:09:57] it to to keep mother from smelling it on
[1:10:00] your breath. And she said, "Junior, have
[1:10:02] you been smoking? What is it?" That's
[1:10:03] the first thing. Now, a red light begins
[1:10:05] to flash. Tell her the truth. Don't go
[1:10:07] this way, little boy. That's wrong.
[1:10:11] Don't lie. But you said, "No, ma'am. I
[1:10:13] haven't smoked." And your little heart
[1:10:15] raced real. You You went out feeling
[1:10:18] real bad. Then it was twice as easy to
[1:10:20] tell a lie the next time. From that
[1:10:22] time, you started lying. We have
[1:10:25] different things started off at that
[1:10:27] time as a child. many habits in life
[1:10:31] that we can think of from that time. So
[1:10:34] it was something that we allow then in
[1:10:37] our lives to that that brought brings us
[1:10:41] to the the the areas of our lives that
[1:10:45] we struggle with today.
[1:10:49] It's seeds that started back then that
[1:10:53] are coming to fruit today. How many
[1:10:56] understands what I'm talking about? Yes.
[1:10:58] Hallelujah. But I'm sure glad God's got
[1:11:00] a big old combine.
[1:11:03] And God can cut down all of those all of
[1:11:06] those seeds. Amen. I I I brother Brandon
[1:11:10] would say, you know, he says the immoral
[1:11:12] woman, she she she might raise up to
[1:11:13] testify and say, I I was I I was once as
[1:11:16] pure as a lily. My my mother raised me
[1:11:19] to be a lady. My father was a godly man.
[1:11:21] My mother also they taught me to go uh
[1:11:23] to Sunday school and to do what is
[1:11:25] right. and and that I did years and
[1:11:27] years. And finally one time there was a
[1:11:28] young man visited our church and I
[1:11:30] noticed he was he was not just like the
[1:11:32] boys that were saved but he was looked a
[1:11:35] nice looking fell. I went on a date with
[1:11:37] him and he persuaded me to take a coke
[1:11:39] one time and had something in it. When I
[1:11:41] came to myself I was polluted from that
[1:11:44] time forth. I started down the wrong
[1:11:45] road from that time that started it. We
[1:11:48] can go back and find the time that I
[1:11:50] felt my virtues of life were gone and
[1:11:53] different. And what difference did it
[1:11:56] did it make now? So I just started
[1:11:58] running from that time. It it happened
[1:12:00] at a certain time. So what I'm trying to
[1:12:03] say, Amen. There se the genesis, the
[1:12:06] seeds, it has a beginning. Everything
[1:12:08] what we are today, the product that we
[1:12:12] are today, good and bad, has come from
[1:12:15] seeds.
[1:12:17] Okay. Amen. Am I making that clear? It's
[1:12:20] come from seeds. So I think we need to
[1:12:22] be careful about those seeds. Amen. A
[1:12:26] and so we we Amen. You you can allow the
[1:12:30] wrong seed. Hosea 10:13 it says you have
[1:12:33] plowed wickedness. No matter how small
[1:12:35] the seed is, you've plowed it and you've
[1:12:38] reaped iniquity and you've eaten the
[1:12:40] fruit of the lies. So I say today, if
[1:12:44] I'm going to be an overcomer, and there
[1:12:47] is there is an art to overcoming, there
[1:12:51] is there is a science, if you will,
[1:12:54] there there is a method to winning. Yes,
[1:12:58] sir. Amen. Just like just like anybody
[1:13:00] that's going if you're going to be an
[1:13:02] athlete, if you're going to be a boxer,
[1:13:03] you're going to be whatever you you
[1:13:05] you've got to be taught. You you you've
[1:13:07] got to know how to fight your opponent.
[1:13:10] And and we've got to understand that
[1:13:13] Satan has come in this day greater than
[1:13:18] any other age. Amen. We have got drugs
[1:13:22] like or that are that are just so easy
[1:13:25] to get to. We have got sin so easy. You
[1:13:30] boys and girls, Amen, could can get on
[1:13:32] your mom and daddy's phone and and and
[1:13:34] and do anything evil you want to. If if
[1:13:37] if if you if your soul desired, you you
[1:13:41] can those things are right here at your
[1:13:44] at your fingertips. It's a lot worse
[1:13:46] than it used to be with a television.
[1:13:48] Yeah.
[1:13:50] Amen. The old television just had three
[1:13:52] channels. Amen. But today, you you've
[1:13:56] got you've got everything right here and
[1:13:57] you just punch up anything and it'll
[1:13:59] pull it right up. Are y'all hearing me?
[1:14:03] So, so we've got to be careful at what
[1:14:06] we allow to be sown into our lives
[1:14:09] because the things you fight today had a
[1:14:13] beginning somewhere else. Amen. So, give
[1:14:16] me good wisdom. Amen. There in in in
[1:14:19] Psalms 25 and 4, show me thy ways, O
[1:14:23] Lord. Teach me thy paths. Give me a keen
[1:14:28] sense of discernment. Let me see through
[1:14:31] all the shams of life. Teach me how to
[1:14:35] identify the spirit behind a thing.
[1:14:38] Amen. There in in Psalms 119 and 66,
[1:14:41] teach me good
[1:14:43] judgment and knowledge, for I have
[1:14:46] believed thy commandments. Teach me,
[1:14:50] teach me to teach me to watch, watch
[1:14:53] what spirits I allow. Can you say amen?
[1:14:56] Well, praise the Lord. Proverbs 10:14 it
[1:14:59] says wise men lay up knowledge or wise
[1:15:03] men treasures hides knowledge but the
[1:15:07] mouth of the foolish is near
[1:15:08] destruction. James 1:19 it says
[1:15:10] wherefore my beloved brethren let every
[1:15:12] man be swift to hear slow to speak. Let
[1:15:17] let let me let me be a learner. Teach me
[1:15:19] teach me how to to to watch. The prophet
[1:15:23] would tell us that's the way it is. Shun
[1:15:26] the appearance of evil. Have the first
[1:15:29] thing in front of you. When it's evil,
[1:15:31] say no. You need to say that. No. That
[1:15:36] settles it. Don't have a wishbone. Have
[1:15:38] a backbone like that. Stand out. See,
[1:15:42] when you know you're right, if you
[1:15:44] believe in God, you're born again, you
[1:15:47] will do it. See, that's right. There's
[1:15:49] no question about that. If you're born
[1:15:52] of good, it'll take care of itself. That
[1:15:55] goes back to that love. Amen. That comes
[1:15:57] up from your heart that we talked about
[1:15:59] this morning. Amen. He says, "Get away
[1:16:01] from it. Pull out. Don't have nothing
[1:16:04] else to do with it. Get away from it
[1:16:06] quickly." If you're fixing to put your
[1:16:08] first cigarette in your mouth tonight or
[1:16:10] take the first drink or go to the first
[1:16:12] rock and roll party or tell your mama
[1:16:14] the first lie, get away from it. It's
[1:16:18] the devil.
[1:16:21] Amen. Now you understand me seeds. God
[1:16:26] help me to be discerning of the right
[1:16:30] seeds. Oh, I wish Martin has been more
[1:16:34] discerning when I look. I was raised in
[1:16:36] church. Amen. And I I I and I I've been
[1:16:39] blessed. But that doesn't mean that I've
[1:16:41] not had struggles and Satan didn't put
[1:16:43] sin seeds in my life that I that I
[1:16:46] nurtured and watered things that have
[1:16:49] come up through me that I've had to
[1:16:51] fight with everything I've got. Amen.
[1:16:55] Are are you are you are you hearing me?
[1:16:57] Amen. So we want to keep those things
[1:17:01] that that are right. As again as a man
[1:17:04] thinkketh in his heart so is he. So if
[1:17:08] you have the right thoughts, how am I
[1:17:10] going to have the right
[1:17:13] thoughts? Well, you ain't going to have
[1:17:14] the right thoughts by listening to
[1:17:16] country and western music. Those that
[1:17:19] western and country are
[1:17:23] seeds, rock and roll music seeds.
[1:17:30] So what do what kind of what kind of
[1:17:33] music is going to sew the right seeds?
[1:17:36] Well, these days you got to be
[1:17:37] discerning on the Christian music
[1:17:40] because Satan has just taken these
[1:17:42] punkers out there and turned them into
[1:17:45] gospel. That don't mean that what
[1:17:47] they're singing is gospel.
[1:17:50] We've got to be discerning of the
[1:17:52] spirit.
[1:17:54] Amen. Help me, Lord. Amen. So,
[1:17:57] everything we listen to should be word
[1:18:00] derived. In other words, whatever your
[1:18:01] thoughts you allow in your mind should
[1:18:04] have its origin from the word of God. As
[1:18:07] your p soul proceeded from God, so
[1:18:10] should your music. So should your what
[1:18:12] you listen to, so should what you read.
[1:18:15] Everything that you that you allow in
[1:18:18] your mind, it should be from God. You
[1:18:21] say, "Well, I just don't believe that."
[1:18:23] Well, that's why I ain't going to say I
[1:18:26] was going to say, "Well, that's why
[1:18:26] you're a loser." Amen. Hallelujah. But
[1:18:29] that's that's not nice. Amen. That's why
[1:18:31] you fight like you fight. Amen.
[1:18:34] Hallelujah. If you reject this
[1:18:37] principle, you're a loser.
[1:18:40] You're not going to win.
[1:18:45] I don't care how long you sit in church.
[1:18:47] I don't care how long how you you you
[1:18:49] you say, "Well, I've been in church for
[1:18:50] 30 years, and I don't have to do that. I
[1:18:52] still listen to
[1:18:54] my I still listen to the old time rock
[1:18:57] and roll stuff." Hallelujah. Uh you you
[1:18:59] you can say what you want to say, but
[1:19:02] I'm here to tell you if you are going to
[1:19:05] be in that supernatural realm with God
[1:19:08] and you're going to overcome devils and
[1:19:10] see the supernatural, you're going to
[1:19:12] have to do it the way God says do it.
[1:19:18] Amen. I don't want to stand on that day
[1:19:21] and be a loser.
[1:19:25] I want to be an overcomer.
[1:19:30] Amen. The Apostle Paul says, he says
[1:19:34] that while I less that when I he says,
[1:19:38] I've got to bring my body under
[1:19:40] subjection. Y'all remember the
[1:19:41] scripture? I've got to bring it under uh
[1:19:44] uh where where's that at? Anyone? If you
[1:19:46] can find that, I Amen. Uh I just look up
[1:19:49] cast away. Amen. The Apostle Paul in the
[1:19:51] New Testament. And then I think you
[1:19:53] you'll go up two verses there. Amen. And
[1:19:55] he says, I keep under my body and bring
[1:19:58] it into subjection lest that by any
[1:20:01] means when I have preached to others I
[1:20:05] myself should become a cast away. Right?
[1:20:10] This is the prophet to the first church
[1:20:14] age. He wrote the entire New Testament
[1:20:16] gospel.
[1:20:18] Okay?
[1:20:20] Now, our prophet says that didn't mean
[1:20:22] that he's losing his salvation. It's
[1:20:24] just that once he got there has no
[1:20:26] rewards. Well, he preached to everyone
[1:20:29] else. He was a loser.
[1:20:34] It It had nothing going to his account.
[1:20:37] Can you say amen? So, I don't want to be
[1:20:40] a loser on that account. Amen. I want to
[1:20:44] sew seeds and get a crop on that day.
[1:20:50] Lord, help me. Some somebody else want
[1:20:52] to say, "Lord, help me. Lord, help me. I
[1:20:56] I got so much of Wendel Martin in me and
[1:20:58] sometimes I get so stinking pigheaded
[1:21:01] and I miss out on the blessings that
[1:21:03] God's given me on." Amen. That that is
[1:21:05] going to be on that day. So everything
[1:21:07] we listen to as you as you sprang from
[1:21:10] God, your thought should be rooted in
[1:21:12] the word. Amen. So So again, you're a
[1:21:16] spirit being, therefore you attract
[1:21:19] spirits. Amen. You your spirit is
[1:21:22] magnetized to that spirit world. How do
[1:21:25] you do it? Through songs, through
[1:21:28] television, through internet, through
[1:21:31] text. Amen. Those things bring those
[1:21:34] things in our lives. Amen. Now, your
[1:21:37] soul has got to feed on something,
[1:21:39] friends. Don't feed your soul junk.
[1:21:42] Amen.
[1:21:44] Why is it so important that I keep that
[1:21:46] that that the right seeds in my heart? I
[1:21:50] I I I go back to this a lot because I
[1:21:54] this is something that that I really um
[1:21:57] you know I you know how some scriptures
[1:21:59] just just really stand out and mean to
[1:22:01] you and you and it might mean something
[1:22:03] more to me than it does to somebody else
[1:22:05] or but but this is something that I've
[1:22:07] just kept in before me and and and to
[1:22:11] help me Titus 1:15 unto the
[1:22:15] pure all things are
[1:22:17] pure but unto them that are defiled.
[1:22:22] Where's defilement come from? Seeds,
[1:22:26] seeds of corruption, seeds of doubt,
[1:22:29] seed things that we have allowed. Amen.
[1:22:32] He says, "But unto them that are defiled
[1:22:34] and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but
[1:22:36] even their mind and their conscience is
[1:22:40] defiled." Well, if I can keep my heart
[1:22:43] pure, how am I going to do that? Give me
[1:22:47] Lord the right seeds. Let me not allow
[1:22:51] things in my life that is going to
[1:22:54] defile me.
[1:22:57] Praise the Lord.
[1:23:00] Amen.
[1:23:01] Now, how do we do
[1:23:03] that? Amen. It says, and I read this
[1:23:07] this morning, but Colossians 3:16, let
[1:23:09] the word of God dwell in you richly.
[1:23:12] That means have a fertile heart in all
[1:23:15] wisdom, teaching and admonishing. That
[1:23:17] means encouraging, warning,
[1:23:18] reprimmending, scolding, rebuking one
[1:23:21] another in psalms and hymns, spiritual
[1:23:24] songs, singing with grace in your hearts
[1:23:25] to the Lord. For whatever you do in word
[1:23:29] or deed, do it all in the name of Jesus,
[1:23:32] giving thanks to God and the father by
[1:23:34] him. Amen. Amen. So, so, so let me do
[1:23:38] that. That means every and whatever we
[1:23:40] do, word, deed, thought, whatever it is,
[1:23:43] let it all be done in Jesus name. And
[1:23:45] the only way you can do that is by
[1:23:46] having those right kind of thoughts and
[1:23:48] seeds. Whatsoever things are pure. Amen.
[1:23:52] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham says if you
[1:23:54] inject something in there that doesn't
[1:23:55] make him the same yesterday, today, and
[1:23:57] forever, he says, where do you go to?
[1:24:00] See? Amen. It's that inside. Now, so I I
[1:24:05] I I I think that's something to look at.
[1:24:08] Brother Brother Banam says, "Now then
[1:24:10] what does that do? From the middle of
[1:24:11] the heart, which is the soul, from there
[1:24:13] goes forth feeding every other channel."
[1:24:15] The trouble is we're standing in here
[1:24:18] with a lot of doubt, trying to accept
[1:24:20] what's out there. You've got to stop
[1:24:22] that and and come down that channel with
[1:24:25] the true word of God that goes out in
[1:24:27] itself automatically. And when it's
[1:24:30] what's on the inside, that's the thing
[1:24:32] that counts is that inside. You say,
[1:24:34] "Well, I don't steal or I don't drink. I
[1:24:37] don't do those things." That has nothing
[1:24:39] to do with it. You can try, as we was
[1:24:41] going through this morning, you can you
[1:24:42] can you can do all the dos and don'ts,
[1:24:44] but that that's not what God's looking
[1:24:45] for. He's one because that'll have its
[1:24:48] time. Amen. Uh uh uh uh that that'll
[1:24:51] have its time. You say, "Okay, I'm not
[1:24:52] going to look at that no more." And you
[1:24:53] might go three months and then all of a
[1:24:54] sudden here it comes back again. Or I'm
[1:24:56] not going to smoke again. And then a
[1:24:58] year later, you're back you're back
[1:25:00] smoking or I'm not going to I'm I'm I am
[1:25:02] not going to allow bitterness ever
[1:25:04] again. God's delivered me. And then
[1:25:06] before you know it, you see that that is
[1:25:08] an outside trying to do things. But what
[1:25:11] we've got to do is remember that on the
[1:25:13] inside, that love of God through the
[1:25:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost on the inside,
[1:25:18] it's a desire that loves that word more
[1:25:20] than it loves bitterness, loves that
[1:25:22] word more than it loves pleasure. It
[1:25:24] loves that word so much that it
[1:25:26] overrides everything else.
[1:25:30] Amen. It overrides it. And the only Holy
[1:25:34] Ghost can do that. Amen. Do you love
[1:25:37] him? Amen. Amen. So he says now, Amen.
[1:25:40] It's the inside. No matter how good you
[1:25:43] are, how moral you are, how truthful you
[1:25:45] are, those things are respected. But
[1:25:46] Jesus said, "Except a man be born again,
[1:25:48] there's got to be something happened on
[1:25:50] the inside. If you don't, it's
[1:25:52] artificial put on. for down in your
[1:25:54] heart you still desire to do it anyhow.
[1:25:56] It can't be artificial. It's got to be
[1:25:57] real. And there's only one avenue that
[1:25:59] it can come down by the way of that free
[1:26:01] moral agency come into that soul through
[1:26:03] your thoughts. As a man thinkketh in his
[1:26:05] heart, so is he. Can you say amen? Now,
[1:26:09] so we want that.
[1:26:11] Now I also and then now and and and one
[1:26:15] last scripture before I I quit there and
[1:26:16] I'm giving a bunch to you here tonight,
[1:26:18] but 1 Corinthians 6:19. Amen. It says,
[1:26:21] "What know ye not that your body is the
[1:26:24] temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[1:26:26] you, which you have of God? You're not
[1:26:28] your own? You have been bought with a
[1:26:31] price. Therefore, glorify your body and
[1:26:35] in your spirit, in your mind, which are
[1:26:38] God's." Can you say amen? Amen. Now, I
[1:26:42] want to That's that. Now, that's what
[1:26:43] you're receiving. What you're receiving
[1:26:44] in. Now, I want to stop for just a
[1:26:47] moment and talk about sewing seeds to
[1:26:51] one another. Amen. Seowing seeds. We are
[1:26:55] or or sewing seeds. Period. Now, what
[1:26:57] I've talked to up to this point is the
[1:26:59] receiving of seeds. You receiving you
[1:27:01] you're you're receiving those seeds. How
[1:27:03] many is going to stand guard on your
[1:27:04] heart? I'm going to stand guard of my
[1:27:07] heart. I've got to watch my heart. I've
[1:27:10] got to watch it when there's things that
[1:27:11] are coming in and there's there's
[1:27:13] there's junk coming in. Amen. And and
[1:27:15] and the devil might might might might
[1:27:17] pull one on you and you get upset and
[1:27:19] get upset with with with the malman or
[1:27:21] get upset with your husband or get upset
[1:27:22] with your wife. Don't don't don't don't
[1:27:24] sit there and and and and uh and pet
[1:27:27] that devil. Repent of it. Repent of it.
[1:27:30] Get that seed back out of the ground
[1:27:31] right now. Say, "I'm sorry. I'm sorry."
[1:27:34] Can you say amen? I'm not going to allow
[1:27:36] bitterness. Not going to allow
[1:27:37] hatefulness. not going to allow those
[1:27:39] spirits to come
[1:27:41] in. Now remember in your sowing and your
[1:27:45] reaping whatsoever a man sws that he
[1:27:49] will reap. I I want us to what does this
[1:27:54] do? Amen.
[1:27:57] Someone had had had told me one time
[1:28:01] that there were that there were seeds
[1:28:03] that were planted and it was the wrong
[1:28:05] seed and and um and I can't remember who
[1:28:09] who it was that was telling me, but
[1:28:10] there was some seeds that were
[1:28:12] planted
[1:28:14] and and it was they didn't have time to
[1:28:17] go and get get the and so they went and
[1:28:20] just smothered those old seeds with with
[1:28:23] the good seed. just just begin to just
[1:28:25] plant it
[1:28:27] hard and and smothering out the old so
[1:28:32] that the new can come forth. And I I I
[1:28:35] think I think sometimes if the devil has
[1:28:38] seown those seeds in our lives, you say,
[1:28:41] "What am I going to do? I've got this
[1:28:42] harvest that keeps coming and coming and
[1:28:45] coming." Well, I believe God I believe
[1:28:48] God can sew his crop in our
[1:28:50] lives. You don't have to die bitter.
[1:28:54] You don't have to die. Amen. Defeated.
[1:28:58] None of us. None of us have to go to the
[1:29:01] grave in our in our feed defeated
[1:29:04] condition. I don't care if you've been
[1:29:05] fighting that same devil for 50 years. I
[1:29:08] want to tell you, you can you can
[1:29:11] overcome. You can overcome.
[1:29:14] But again, it's got to be a love for him
[1:29:17] and a getting rid of that P R I D E with
[1:29:20] that middle letter I. Amen. Got to get
[1:29:24] rid of that. Got to get rid of the
[1:29:27] me. He that seweth sparingly will reap
[1:29:31] sparingly. He that sweth
[1:29:34] wisely. He that sweth bountifully shall
[1:29:38] reap bountifully.
[1:29:41] Every man, this is 2 Corinthians 9
[1:29:45] and6. He that he that seweth sparingly
[1:29:48] will reap sparingly. He that sweth
[1:29:50] bountifully will reap bountifully. Every
[1:29:53] man according as he hath purposed in his
[1:29:55] heart, so let him give not grudgingly or
[1:29:56] of necessity. For God loves a cheerful
[1:29:59] giver. God is able to make all grace
[1:30:02] abound toward you that you always have
[1:30:06] all sufficiency in all things may abound
[1:30:09] to every good
[1:30:13] work. I think
[1:30:16] mamas, you might not realize it right
[1:30:19] now was Mother's Day last
[1:30:21] Sunday and how we love you mamas. We
[1:30:24] can't say enough about you mamas. the
[1:30:27] seeds you're sewing into those kids.
[1:30:28] You're not seeing it right now. And
[1:30:30] maybe you might not see it right
[1:30:32] now, but don't don't
[1:30:37] ever don't ever
[1:30:42] uh lose confidence in your seed. Here's
[1:30:45] your seed. This is the seed bag.
[1:30:48] Hallelujah. I wish I had a bag.
[1:30:51] Amen. Hallelujah. Here's your seed bag.
[1:30:56] And when you're when you're planting in
[1:30:58] and and
[1:31:00] and you're planting your seeds in in the
[1:31:03] rows as you're going down the road,
[1:31:05] you've got to have confidence that that
[1:31:08] seed is going to produce the kind of
[1:31:11] crop that you're putting in the ground.
[1:31:14] Because if you don't, you might if
[1:31:16] you're saying, "Well, I don't know if
[1:31:17] it's going to work." Well, I don't know
[1:31:19] if this se this Bible is a book of
[1:31:23] seeds.
[1:31:25] It it it His word is true. His word is
[1:31:30] sure. His word can't fail. So if you're
[1:31:34] taking these seeds, Amen. and you're
[1:31:37] sewing those seeds into the hearts of
[1:31:40] your children, you're not going to get
[1:31:42] your crop
[1:31:43] immediately. It's not going to come up.
[1:31:45] You're not going to wake up the next day
[1:31:47] and say, "Oh,
[1:31:49] man." You You're not going to be able to
[1:31:51] look two weeks down and say, "Man, that
[1:31:55] don't look nothing like a an apple tree,
[1:31:58] or that don't look nothing like wheat.
[1:32:01] That don't I don't see no green
[1:32:04] beans." But you've got to keep planting
[1:32:06] the
[1:32:08] seed because if you plant the seed,
[1:32:10] you're going to reap.
[1:32:13] Mama planted the seed in my life. And
[1:32:16] there was a time or two or three that
[1:32:18] she might have questioned her seed. She
[1:32:21] for sure questioned her
[1:32:23] boy. But you see, the seed won
[1:32:26] out, right? And the seeds that you're
[1:32:30] planting in your children are going to
[1:32:32] come. Don't grow weary. You're going to
[1:32:36] reap.
[1:32:38] If you faint
[1:32:41] not, what does that mean? Well, it don't
[1:32:44] matter what I sew. And then all of a
[1:32:45] sudden, you're spewing and you're this
[1:32:47] and you're that. Keep sewing the seed in
[1:32:49] the road. Keep keep it going. Your seed
[1:32:52] is going the seed God's word cannot
[1:32:55] fail. Can I hear an amen?
[1:32:59] It can't fail. See, so so we can't grow
[1:33:02] weary in in the sewing of the seed.
[1:33:06] I want us to also think about this.
[1:33:09] Seowing seeds into your I in in in into
[1:33:14] your your children, your husband, those
[1:33:16] around you. Seowing those seeds by your
[1:33:19] words of of of uh uh uh before I get
[1:33:24] into the words. Amen. Let's I want to
[1:33:26] get back to you mamas real quickly
[1:33:28] because here's the scripture. I forgot
[1:33:29] about it. They're in in Psalms 126 and5.
[1:33:33] They that sow in
[1:33:36] tears shall reap in joy.
[1:33:43] Seowing is
[1:33:46] hard. Seowing the right seeds and doing
[1:33:49] the right thing is hard. It's easy to
[1:33:53] just spew. It's easy to just go the but
[1:33:56] but are you want to keep the same old
[1:33:58] crop that you have been keeping all of
[1:34:00] your
[1:34:01] life or do you want to receive the crop
[1:34:04] the blessings that comes from God's
[1:34:07] word sewing in tears agony lots of times
[1:34:12] lots of times it's in agony Lord take
[1:34:15] this junk out of my heart I want to make
[1:34:16] sure that I sew the right seeds lots of
[1:34:20] times that you're in prayer and you're
[1:34:21] agonizing for your for your children and
[1:34:24] you're saying, "Lord, and what are you
[1:34:25] doing? You're speaking words over them.
[1:34:28] Lord, Johnny's not doing well. Johnny
[1:34:31] Johnny's fighting his battle. He's in
[1:34:32] his teenage years. Amen. You can you see
[1:34:35] how how he's testing me every time I
[1:34:37] turn around. But Lord, I'm sewing those
[1:34:40] seeds and you're agonizing. Satan, you
[1:34:43] can't have his soul. Satan, you can't
[1:34:45] have her. You cannot. I plead the blood
[1:34:48] over her. I don't don't go the way of
[1:34:51] the world with them.
[1:34:54] Sew the seeds,
[1:34:57] well, praise the Lord,
[1:34:59] man. I I I remember there was, you know,
[1:35:02] we we we had we there was there was a
[1:35:03] family one time, Amen. When the kids got
[1:35:05] up to that point, they said, "Well, I
[1:35:06] got to bring a TV in the house because
[1:35:08] I'm afraid of losing them." I said,
[1:35:10] "You're you're you're you're missing the
[1:35:11] point. You are bringing you're you're
[1:35:13] bringing all of evil right in there for
[1:35:14] them to listen to. Why don't we start
[1:35:16] praying and calling out to God and
[1:35:19] sowing those good seeds and let's see
[1:35:21] God deliver them.
[1:35:23] Amen.
[1:35:26] He that goeth forth and weepeth bearing
[1:35:28] precious
[1:35:29] seed shall doubtless come again. Gala,
[1:35:33] this is Psalms 126 and six. He that
[1:35:38] goeth forth and
[1:35:40] weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
[1:35:44] doubtless come again with
[1:35:46] rejoicing, bringing his sheav behind
[1:35:49] him.
[1:35:53] Why? It's just a fact. You're going to
[1:35:56] reap what you sow.
[1:36:01] Well, praise the
[1:36:03] Lord. So, let my words help me, Lord.
[1:36:07] Let me sow the right kind of words.
[1:36:09] Amen. Let me Amen. There in Proverbs 16
[1:36:13] and 23 it says, "The heart of the wise
[1:36:15] teaches his mouth and addeth or
[1:36:17] increasth
[1:36:19] learning." Amen. To his
[1:36:22] lips. Amen. Pleasant words are as a
[1:36:25] honeycomb. Sweet to the soul and health
[1:36:27] to the
[1:36:28] bones.
[1:36:30] Amen. So let me sew those seeds. Let me
[1:36:33] sew those right kind. So when we talk
[1:36:35] about
[1:36:36] overcoming, Lord, I'm going to watch
[1:36:40] what I receive in
[1:36:41] me and I'm going to watch what I give
[1:36:46] out. Let me be an overcomer.
[1:36:50] How many's got that in your heart today?
[1:36:51] I want to be an overcomer. Amen.
[1:36:55] Hallelujah. I don't care if I don't care
[1:36:58] what Johnny does. I don't care how bad
[1:37:01] the situation gets. I'm not I I I I I am
[1:37:05] anchored. I know where I stand. The word
[1:37:07] of God is true. And I'm going to keep on
[1:37:09] speaking the word of God over Johnny's
[1:37:11] life. I'm gonna I'm going to keep on
[1:37:13] speaking the word of God over Susie Q's
[1:37:15] life. I'm going to keep on I'm going I'm
[1:37:18] those words are are are powerful. I'm
[1:37:22] not speaking doubt. I'm not speaking
[1:37:24] evil. I am speaking the word of God. And
[1:37:27] and and I'm here to tell you and I and
[1:37:29] I'm Amen. I'm speaking I'm speaking a
[1:37:31] rapture for my sons. I'm speaking a
[1:37:33] rapture for my daughters. I'm speaking a
[1:37:35] rapture for my grandchildren. I'm
[1:37:37] speaking a rapture. Amen. What am I
[1:37:40] doing? You say, "Well, Amen. Does it
[1:37:43] does it does it uh uh uh do they got to
[1:37:47] hear it?" Well, they need to hear it.
[1:37:51] Amen. They got to hear it. If if my wife
[1:37:54] is is is is just constantly putting me
[1:37:57] down and telling me that I'm just a man,
[1:38:00] I'm just I'm a couple degrees short of a
[1:38:03] man and uh that I I I'll never be
[1:38:06] anything. Well, it sure doesn't sew the
[1:38:08] kind of confidence in my life to come
[1:38:10] home and say,
[1:38:11] "Amen. I'm going to come home a little
[1:38:13] more hunchback and defeated and right
[1:38:16] because she's sewing those seeds into my
[1:38:19] life." Hallelujah. If I sew seeds into
[1:38:23] into my into my girl's life and I I'm
[1:38:25] saying I'm saying thing that's
[1:38:27] constantly contrary and and and
[1:38:30] and that that that would put her down.
[1:38:32] Well, you think that's going to build
[1:38:33] confidence? You think she's going to
[1:38:34] want to give me a kiss? You think she's
[1:38:36] going to want to cook me a
[1:38:39] meal? But I got to sew seeds of love
[1:38:42] under her life. All right.
[1:38:46] Don't tell you don't don't in your in

[1:38:59] baby could get
[1:39:01] this. What's your problem? You're sewing
[1:39:04] seeds and it's going to come up in a
[1:39:06] complex,
[1:39:08] right? You can't do that. Now, I know
[1:39:12] they're not meeting your approval right
[1:39:14] now. I know that. But if you're wanting
[1:39:18] a crop, then you've got to start
[1:39:20] planting the right seed into that heart.
[1:39:23] And I promise you, if you build that, if
[1:39:26] you plant this seed, it's a it's a Jesus
[1:39:29] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:39:31] forever. What it was yesterday, what it
[1:39:33] was throughout the church ages is what
[1:39:34] it'll do today if you'll plant the right
[1:39:36] seeds.
[1:39:39] And those kids can feel your spirit.
[1:39:41] Those kids know whether you love them or
[1:39:43] whether you don't. Your husband knows
[1:39:46] whether you love them or whether you
[1:39:47] don't. Even in the times where you ain't
[1:39:49] feeling nothing, you need to make sure
[1:39:50] that he feels it. Your love.

[1:51:27] We thank you for your word for it is
[1:51:31] eternal. I thank you Lord for allowing
[1:51:34] me to to be a swer of
[1:51:39] seed. Lord to my wife, my
[1:51:42] children as pastor here, Lord, behind
[1:51:45] the pull
[1:51:47] pit. I thank you, Lord, for that awesome
[1:51:52] privilege. Lord, let me always make sure
[1:51:55] it's the right seed.
[1:51:57] Forgive me for the times that I've
[1:51:59] planted the wrong
[1:52:01] stuff. Forgive me, Lord, for the times,
[1:52:04] Lord, that I've
[1:52:08] erred. Oh God, we're frail human
[1:52:12] beings, so vulnerable to
[1:52:15] mistakes. But Lord
[1:52:17] Jesus, we thank you for your grace and
[1:52:20] your
[1:52:21] mercy. Help us, Lord.
[1:52:24] Now, Father, I went a little longer than
[1:52:26] I anticipated
[1:52:28] tonight. Hopefully, I didn't go in
[1:52:31] circles, but take my broken up thoughts
[1:52:34] here this evening and let it find a good
[1:52:39] ground for it to rest in and
[1:52:44] grow. Oh God, bless every mom and daddy.
[1:52:49] Bless bless every Lord if we have fallen
[1:52:55] short Lord and we're we're eaten from
[1:53:01] the bitter herbs that we have
[1:53:05] planted. We know Lord that you can come
[1:53:08] through there and annihilate all
[1:53:12] that and you can make all things new and
[1:53:16] you can help us to
[1:53:19] overcome. And I ask that you would do
[1:53:23] that. Let every young man, young woman
[1:53:28] really take
[1:53:29] these these thoughts into our hearts.
[1:53:34] The older I get, the more I appreciate
[1:53:37] it. My mom and dad, they just didn't
[1:53:40] allow a lot
[1:53:42] of a lot of gossip in the house. Just
[1:53:45] just wouldn't hear
[1:53:47] it. They didn't allow a lot of things.
[1:53:51] And Lord, it kept my heart so
